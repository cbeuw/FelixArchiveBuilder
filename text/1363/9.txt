Why vote No? Do it for your club!
M
any people have
commented on the
NUS referendum
so far, covering
everything from
discounts to representation. This
time round I want to cover the
things most people care about
– clubs & societies. I know that this
extra money that we are saving
from ULU could do a lot of good for
clubs. Last year I was ACC Chair,
responsible for ensuring that all of
Imperial’s sports clubs were run-
ning smoothly. I also organised the
odd ACC Barnight, which seem to
have gained a certain notoriety.
This is why I feel so strongly about
why Imperial students should vote
No! to joining the NUS.
Far too many people dismiss us
as “apathetic.” Quite the opposite
is true in fact. Imperial College
has one of the highest club partici-
pation rates in the country. They
are all run by dedicated volunteers
and members turn out regularly.
This is evidence of a student body
who relishes getting involved, not
one that lets the world drift past
them. Just because you don’t give
a toss for union politics (lets face
it, who does?) it dosen’t make you
apathetic.
The NUS will tell you that they
can make your clubs better (in fact,
they did on Live! last week at live.
cgcu.net/editions/nus/1318). For
sports clubs, they might tell you
that the NUS is the only student

organisation involved with the 2012
Olympics, so we’d better affiliate to
get involved. Lets not forget that
British University Sports Asso-
ciation, which we affiliate to, have
been involved from the start.
Finally, they’ll say how much
better our student media could be
with the support they can provide
– they’ve even launched their own
student media awards. All this for
only £52,000!
But this is an argument for the
NO campaign, so there must be a
catch. According to the Association
of Managers in Students’ Unions:
per head, Imperial College Union
is one of the best funded unions in
the country. We have more clubs
and societies than any other un-
ion, and our sports clubs are active
and successful. But there is always
room for improvement, £52,000
could give our clubs that extra bit
of funding that could make all the
difference.
Sport Imperial are also involved
with the 2012 Olympics and have
been so from the beginning. This
year the College and the Union
have set up a Sports Federation,
bringing in a new staff member
dedicated to sport and using Col-
lege’s resources to strengthen our
sports clubs. We have the resourc-
es of a juggernaut with half a billion
pounds of turnover per year at our
disposal for sport. The NUS has a
turnover of less than £4m – less, in
fact, than ICU itself.
I
t’s funny to think that a little
less than two years ago I was
in the middle of a bitter bat-
tle with the NUS to ‘save’ Ed-
inburgh from becoming one
of its faceless members, and now
I’m writing an article in support of
a YES vote. I feel a little bad to be
honest, a bit like I’m somehow be-
traying someone or something, but
what really drives me is the knowl-
edge, as a sabbatical, that joining
NUS is the right thing to do.
Don’t get me wrong; I’m not
saying that NUS is a perfect or-
ganisation. There are still faults
within the juggernaut that is the
National Union. Decision-making
can still be dominated by factions,
procedures and processes are still
bizarrely complex, organisation is
still unfeasibly poor, and commu-
nication is still not up to scratch.
These are all the things that I, as
the head of a NO campaign can-
nily entitled ‘Students Against the
NUS at Edinburgh (SANE!), cam-
paigned on.
But what I wasn’t really thinking
about (or rather, what I was shy-
ing away from at the time) was the
fact that you can’t reform some-
thing from the outside. You have
to get into something to criticise
it. There’s absolutely no point in
standing on the sidelines shout-
ing about how rubbish something
is unless you’re prepared to roll up
your sleeves and get involved. Yes
NUS can be (at times) inefficient
and a touch shady. No that doesn’t
mean we should dump it and move
on. NUS is reforming itself. We can
only influence that, and make sure
it happens, if we are there. If Im-
perial joins now, you can all play
a massive role in reforming our
national union. That, of all things,
should be a draw.
When I was running the NO camp
in Edinburgh we spent a lot of time
talking about beer and discounts. I
am convinced that the things that
really mattered to students during
the referendum were beer and dis-
counts. If we joined, would they get
cheaper beer? Would they be able
to get student rate in clubs back
home? Would they get the blessed
NUS discount card? But if you ask
me now, none of those things really
matter.
What does matter is what we are
doing as a student movement. The
government has scrapped grants
and introduced loans, fees and
variable fees. This is a hard time
for higher education and we must
all work together to fight for what
is right. It’s old, it’s clichéd, but it’s
true: together we are stronger than
The NUS student media awards
are all very well, but Imperial’s stu-
dent media is doing quite well by
itself. Over the summer Stoic TV,
our student TV station, won best
broadcaster at the National Stu-
dent Television Awards. Felix has
been short-listed in five categories
at the Guardian Student Media
Awards (and won two top awards),
and IC Radio is in the running in
two categories at the Student Ra-
dio Awards. There are plenty of
awards open to all students, with-
out the NUS having some of their
own.
Now for the money bit! Affiliation
will cost £52,000 and we have 250
clubs. That’s an average of £208 per
club. It’s also roughly the budget
for the whole RCC, the whole med-
ics union or the following put to-
gether: Arts & Ents Board, Media
Group, SCC, RSM, City & Guilds
College Union and the Royal Col-
lege of Science Union. Perhaps we
could give Cheese Society some
money for Cheese in the process.
Other options include employing
additional staff to reduce the work-
load of our volunteers, so they can
spend more time running activities
and less time doing paperwork.
The NUS Extra card also comes
with strings. I was recently at Uni-
versity of Westminster which has
25000 students and after a month
they have only sold 2000. Extra
staff had to be hired and new lap-
tops had to be purchased to admin-

wrong; I’m not

ister the scheme and we will prob-
ably have to do the same. Imperial
students can get discounts at a lot
of places including HMV, Odeon,
VUE, Cineworld, and McDonalds.
NUS are campaigning to get these
companies to give exclusive dis-
counts to NUS extra card holders.
Do you really want to spend £52,000
on a organisation that actively
campaigns against the interest of
ALL students?
Since I started talking about their
campaigns, let’s not forget about
the lecturers strike. The strike af-
fectedthousandsofstudentsacross
the country, many have struggled
to find jobs due to results or exams
being late. Who was it that sup-
ported the strike? The NUS. They
would rather stick to their dogma
than act on behalf of thousands of
students who faced the prospect
of not being awarded their degree,
endangering many conditional job
offers. Were they aware that stu-
dents were suffering?
One member of their executive
was. An emergency motion was ta-
bled at the start of their conference
basically saying “this is important,
lets talk about this first”. The Con-
ference voted against this, taking
less than 30 minutes to reach their
decision. Do we really want to join
this bunch?
Leaving ULU is no reason to
waste £52,000, vote NO! to have

and societies this NO!vember.

Now I’m a believer – I’d vote Yes!
when we are apart. If we all come
together to fight for our rights then
we stand a much better chance of
winning. If we remain fractured we
will get nowhere. That is how the
government has trodden on us for
so long. We need a national voice,
and NUS really is the only show in
town.
