“I just cannot betray their interests”
Why did Southampton leave the
NUS?
Southampton left the NUS in 2002
because it was considered very
bad value for money. Southampton
could not see any clear reason to
spend the affiliation fee and after
investigation we found out that we
could do everything the NUS sup-
posedly does for us in-house . The
‘National Voice’ that we had never
listened to us and was far too radi-
cal to represent our students.
How much have you saved on
affiliation fees and how have you
put the money to better use?
Since we left, we have saved over
£200,000.
We have built a state of the art
radio station, our AU budget has
dramatically increased, we have
doubled our own Welfare and Edu-
cation campaigns budgets (so we
can run Ed/Wel campaigns our
students want to see and ask for,
not some NUS forced campaign),
we have doubled our own external
campaigns budget, we have refur-
bished our nightclub and bars and
we are about to start on a capital
project to refurbish our shop.
We have hired more members of
staff – a postgraduate coordinator
which has greatly improved our
representation, and a course-rep
coordinator which means we have
a very effective rep system set up
now. These are things that make a
difference to student’s day to day
lives on campus. They care about
getting a degree, having a good
time, and getting a job.
This is what Southampton Univer-
sity Students Union aims at doing,
and we do it very well, far far better
than we ever could in the NUS.
Why were you asked to leave the
balcony at the NUS conference?
Funnily enough I went to NUS con-
ference to sit on the balcony and
learn about their democracy and
how they do things.
I became increasingly disillu-
sioned and frustrated with their
whole process and this was cli-
maxed by being thrown off the
balcony. It was during the “ban
Coca-Cola” motion – someone on
the balcony from a radical group
got upset and started screaming at
the chair of conference. As a conse-
quence the NUS President decided
to throw the 100+ people off the
balcony because they couldn’t deal
with one person. This is the way the
NUS manages and handles things
– abysmally.
What was going on at the
conference?
NUS Conference was the single big-
gest joke I have ever seen in my en-
tire life. I saw their National Exec
explain how they were in £500,000
of debt and get off scot-free. No-
body holds them to account. If I ran
Southampton into a relative £50,000
of debt I would be grilled and most
likely sacked!
I saw the NUS waste time on
useless ‘No Platform’ policy and I
saw them prioritise the Coca-Cola
debate over the AUT debate. As a
result, it left them in such a mess
last year and thousands of students
were disrupted.
Several Unions were so upset
with the NUS’ stance on the AUT
strike and their lack of democracy
that they threatened to disaffiliate.
That was very nearly the end of the
NUS and their so-called effective
‘National Voice’.
Southampton President Ben Rogers talks to Stephen Brown about why the welfare of Southampton
students is best served keeping their union out of the NUS and why Imperial students should vote No
Do Southampton students have
problems getting discounts?
Very rarely. Businesses care about
student trade, not about the NUS
logo. Any club or business that our
student have a problem with nor-
mally one letter or phone call from
the Union President explaining the
situation about the NUS and the
problem is solved.
You may have more money, but
surely this leaves your Union iso-
lated with no external influence?
‘No external influence’ not at all
– we are having an influence right
now! Southampton wants a Nation-
al Union, but it has tried for so long
to change things from the inside.
But nobody listens. If you are not
in a faction you are marginalised. If
you do not have the support of La-
bour Students and the other main
factions your motion will not get
through. The only way the National
Union will change is if student un-
ions start to leave. Why do you think
they swarm campuses whenever a
referendum appears? They need
the money to survive. Withdrawing
this money forces them to listen.
Southampton has ‘been on its own’
for 4 years and just last year alone
our President met with the head
of the AUT, Sally Hunt and was on
BBC Breakfast News putting our
students views across during the
strike. There are many ways to get
a national voice you just need to be
proactive about it and be proactive
when working with other Unions.
What is your opinion on the NUS
attitude to top-up fees?
I think that recent articles have se-
verely damaged the NUS’s stance
on tuition fees. The government
I
f I had been around during the
last referendum, I would prob-
ably have voted “no”. Back
then there were serious con-
cerns about the structure and
finances of the NUS, along with un-
answeredquestionsregardingICU’s
ability to pay the affiliation fee. Since
then the financial and political cli-
mates within both the NUS and ICU
have changed, which is why I have
changed my mind and now support
the “yes” campaign. In spite of these
changes, I am still seeing many of
the old arguments against the NUS
resurfacing even though most of
them no longer apply to this debate.
So, even if your mind is set, please
allow me to guide you through some
of the myths that I personally believe
no longer apply to this debate.
“We can’t afford the affiliation
fee”: We currently pay £79,000 each
year to affiliate to ULU. When we
leave ULU next year, we could, in
theory, use this money to pay for
the £52,000 NUS affiliation fee, leav-
ing plenty of money spare. The key
point is that, unlike last time, clubs
funding and beer prices would be
completely unaffected if we affiliate
to the NUS.
“If we join then I won’t be able to
buyKitKatsfromtheUnionshop”:
The ICU Executive has categorical-
ly ruled out affiliating to NUSSL (the
NUS buying consortium that impos-
es these restrictions) so we will still
be able to sell Kit Kats, Pepsi, Real
Ale and anything else that takes our
fancy.
“The NUS is in debt”: Thanks to
major restructuring in recent years,
NUS finances are now sound and
the organisation is no longer in debt.
Dun and Bradsheet, who specialise
in risk assessment, named the NUS
“one of the most financially viable or-
ganisations in the sector” last year.
“The NUS is dominated by polit-
ical factions”: The majority of NUS
students and officers, including the
current President and several Ex-
ecutive committee members, do not
overtly support any political party
and stood for election as “Independ-
ents”. Furthermore, although there
are political elements within the
NUS just as there are within Impe-
rial’s student body, the consensus
within NUS is that there has been
a shift towards the centre-ground
within recent years.
“NUS conference is dominated
by discussions on foreign policy”:
Thanks to recent changes, the vast
majority of time at conference is al-
located to issues that affect students
as students. The reforms introduced
last year require 75% of conference
debating time to be devoted to stu-
dents’ unions, welfare, education
and the NUS itself. The remaining
time is used to discuss other issues
that students wish to raise (e.g. Cli-
mate Change, Make Poverty History,
the fair-trade movement and so on).
For the record, none of the motions
passed at the last conference men-
tions “Palestine”, “Iraq”, or “George
W Bush”.
“We could work with other in-
dependent unions as an alterna-
tive to joining the NUS”: 98% of
students in Higher Education are
represented by the NUS. Those in
England that aren’t affiliated are
Southampton, Sunderland, North-
ampton, the Open University and
us. The notion that we could form an
alliance with these disparate institu-
tions to somehow provide a counter-
balance against the rest of the coun-
try is frankly ridiculous.
“The NUS top up fees policy is
different from ours”: This is simply
not true (for details, see my “Live!”
article). Anyway, we are and always
would be free to disagree with the
NUS, and from time to time some af-
filiated unions do.
“You’re doing this because
now believes that the NUS have
been scaring students off higher
education by not promoting the
benefits they bring to the poorest
students. The NUS has been scare-
mongering by presenting a doom
and gloom picture about student
debt.
Even on its National Demo, where
we had a chance to unite, the mes-
sage was, again, confused and con-
flated with many banners saying
different things. Some were shout-
ing for a totally free education,
some were shouting for not lifting
the cap on top up fees, some were
shouting against top-up fees as a
whole, some were shouting about
the war and how they should fund
education with this money instead –
where is the united message?! This
kaleidoscope of opinion just blurred
any sort of united messages the
NUS wanted to give. Hardly worth
paying £50,000 for!
What about the rumour that sev-
eral Unions threatened to disaf-
filiate during the lecturers strike
because of the stance the NUS
was taking?
The NUS was originally support-
ing the lecturers in their pay claim.
However the NUS never discussed
what its stance should be at con-
ference (too busy talking about no
platform policy and Coca-Cola) and
several Unions were outraged. Led
by Exeter Students’ Union a break-
away group was almost formed.
Around 30 students unions were
so disillusioned they threatened to
withdraw their affiliation fees until
the NUS discussed its stance. This
is the sort of ‘collective action’ and
‘national voice’ that Imperial can
buy for only £52,000 a year!
Describe your typical NUS del-
egate and National Exec member.
From what I have seen the typi-
cal NUS delegate follows a very
predictable set of steps. Step one,
forget about all the people you rep-
resent. Step two, join a faction that
interests you. Factions are groups
of ‘buddies’ that have similar in-
terests and all gang up and club
together and make war with other
groups of buddies with interests
sometimes that differ at only a mi-
croscopic level.
Step three is tow the party line
and vote how your buddies vote,
or you’ll be kicked out of the buddy
circle. And that is where represen-
tation and democracy fails within
the NUS. A candidate can come
forward with really good ideas and
who really could change things…
but they will never get voted in if
they don’t have the support of the
buddies. And you get support of
buddies by towing their line and
saying things they want to hear…
and then, again, this is where rep-
resentation fails.
If you are in it for yourself, NUS
is great because you have so many
new friends to make. You have loads
of opportunity to run for all these
exciting positions. Everyone claps
and cheers you when you decide
to re-affiliate, as was the case with
Edinburgh. If I was in it for myself,
I would take Southampton back in
today… but when I remember the
students I represent, and the state
that the NUS is in, I can’t do it, I just
cannot betray their interests in this
way.
I urge all Imperial students to
vote no! You will always be able to
find like-minded unions, like South-
hampton, to work with.
Eight common myths about the NUS exposed
you’re a career politician vying for
a job in NUS”: I am supporting the
“yes” campaign because I don’t be-
lieve that it is in our interests to be
the most isolated student union in
London. When we leave ULU next
year we will lose our links with the
few student unions that we regu-
larly interact with (e.g. LSE, UCL,
Kings, etc). This isolation will harm
our Union and reduce its ability to do
its job, representing the views of its
members. I have no intention of run-
ning for an NUS position (this year’s
deadline has passed anyway!). Be-
sides, I have had enough of student
politics so I am off to find a proper
job.
So I say let’s give them a chance: I
accept that the NUS has its faults –
all organisations do (including ICU).
However, on balance I think that the
benefits of affiliating to the NUS eas-
ily outweigh the advantages of stay-
ing outside. If we join and find that
the NUS really is not for us, then we
can always hold another referen-
dum in a couple of years. At the end
of the day I see that NUS as a group
of students, not too dissimilar from
us, who work tirelessly to ensure
that the voice of students is heard
so that the lives of those we claim to
represent can be improved.
“On balance I
think that the
benefits of
affiliating to
the NUS easily
outweigh the
benefits of
staying outside”
