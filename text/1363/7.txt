IC team beats Cambridge, MIT, Harvard, and Tokyo to second place in the prestigious iGEM competition
Picture the scene. It’s summer 2006.
Undergraduates, exams success-
fully navigated, head off to roam the
world, free from the toil of univer-
sity for three long months. But look
closely; there are still signs of life
in the Bioengineering Department.
Hidden away in a small corner of
the building, a team of undergradu-
ates and postgraduates are working
on a new research project in col-
laboration with Professors Richard
Kitney and Paul Freemont. Their
brief is a demanding one. In just ten
weeks they have to show that sim-
ple biological systems can be built
from standard, interchangeable
parts and operated in living cells.
The results were presented at the
iGEM (international Genetically
Engineered Machine) competition
in Boston last weekend. On the eve
of their flight to Boston, the team
took time out to talk to me about
their work intensive summer.
So, why did eight undergraduates
decide to forego the pleasures of
the summer break to work on Im-
perial’s iGEM entry? “I don’t think
any of us had any idea how much
work was involved,” admits Fa-
rah Vohra, a biomedical engineer-
ing student. “But the competition
simply sounded interesting,” adds
Christin Sander, also a student in
biomedical engineering.
Within a few short weeks, the
team had decided that they would
attempt to build the world’s first
molecular oscillator. Even to have
reached such a decision so quickly
was impressive. “Getting familiar
with the ideas was a huge hurdle,”
says Farah. John Chattaway, a biol-
ogy student agrees: “we spent the
first week just finding out about
synthetic biology!” This is an obvi-
ous problem for the team. In the
US, where the study of synthetic
biology began five years ago, many
students are taught synthetic bio-
logical principles in their lectures.
US colleges choose their iGEM
teams early in the year, giving
these teams a running start when
the competition begins. Will Impe-
rial adopt a similar approach to this
in future years? “That would be a
good idea. A very good idea,” says
Farah.
But back to the oscillator. I ask
the team to explain the potential
applications of their system. “If we
treat the oscillator as a clock we can
control other things in the system;
make sure things happen at peri-
odic times,” Farah tells me. This
conjures up images of a biological
computer in my mind. Jiongjun Bai,
an electronic engineering student,
agrees:“thiscouldrevolutioniseour
way of thinking about materials. So
in future we won’t need transistors
or semi-conductors; everything can
be built from biological materials.”
Not all of the iGEM teams have
chosen this line of inquiry. “MIT
have made some smelly bacteria,”
says Farah. I’m not sure quite what
to make of this, but the examples
are coming too thick and fast to
raise questions: “and Cambridge
have made some bacteria that
fight. The culture changes colour
Imperial College wipes the floor
as one population becomes domi-
nant,” Farah continues. “It’s like a
war game,” adds Jiongjun, “there
are lots of innovative ideas. We are
at the competition to impress.”
But this is no ordinary compe-
tition, I suggest. There is a sur-
prising level of openness, with all
teams providing regular progress
updates on the Internet. “It’s all
on our wiki,” Farah explains, “so
other teams can look at it and use
it to help with their own research.”
“Yes, the competition promotes
openness,” adds Christin, “so eve-
ryone knows what’s going on. It’s
not a strict competition.”
A key feature of Synthetic Biol-
ogy is its strong cross-discipline
approach. The undergraduates on
the iGEM team are drawn from
electrical engineering, biomedical
engineering, biology and biochem-
istry. I wonder if it was easy to work
together. “It’s been an experience,”
says Farah diplomatically. They all
agree with this. Christin explains
why this approach is important:
“the concepts people bring with
them are different. And the way to
approach a problem; that’s differ-
ent too. But that’s the point. To try
to gain the advantages of the differ-
ent fields.” I probe deeper into the
contrast between the engineering
and biological approach. “We found
that the engineers were thinking
‘OK, this is what I want to build’, but
the biologists were working at the
DNA level, thinking ‘OK, but what
have we actually got, and what can
we do with it?’ They had limitations
in mind whereas the engineers
Get involved
probably didn’t,” says Christin.
These contrasting perspectives
are evident during the interview;
there are a number of disagree-
ments about the answers to my
questions, reflecting the different
academic backgrounds on show.
But it always remains very friendly,
an amazing accomplishment con-
sidering the team have been work-
ing together intensively for several
weeks. I ask if the experience has
been worthwhile. “We learnt a lot,”
says Christin, “not just about syn-
thetic biology, but about general
research.” My own undergrad sum-
mers were spent earning much-
needed cash to pay for University.
Did the experience gained make up
for this loss of earnings? “Oh, we did
get paid,” John corrects me. “Yes,
but it wasn’t proportional to the
input though,” comments Farah.
Truly, then, these undergrads have
learnt some valuable lessons about
the nature of scientific research.
As Felix was going to press, we
heard that the Imperial iGEM
team had been named the over-
all first runner-up at the competi-
tion in Boston, beating many other
well established teams along the
way. They also won first prize in
the Best Documentation and Best
Measurement and Part Characteri-
sation Categories. This is a fantas-
tic achievement for the team, con-
sidering that this is the first year
they have taken part in the contest..
Ninth university in the world? After
this week’s iGEM competition, the
other eight had better start watch-
ing their backs.

Looking for something to do
this summer? Want to get in-
volved with the fastest growing
new science since the dot-com
revolution? Imperial College is
now recruiting team members
for its entry to the 2007 iGEM
competition. Students from
all disciplines will work on the
project over the summer be-
fore jetting off to present their
work at the annual Jamboree
at MIT in November.
iGEM (international Geneti-
cally Engineered Machine) is a
competition set up to explore
what it is that makes things
alive – whether or not we can
just break life up into a series
of constituent components.
Involving all disciplines
from biology to engineering,
it involves trying to ‘engineer’
biological devices by using
standardized parts called “Bi-
oBricks”. New Biobricks are
released every year as the sci-
ence advances, so each year
students are working on the
cutting edge.
