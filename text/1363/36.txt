who advertises a student

NUS will this year be launching its own media
awards.
Felix has 4 nominations in the prestigious
Guardian Student Media Awards.
Stoic TV scooped the Best Broadcaster award at
this year’s National Student Television Awards
IC Radio was shortlisted for 2 National Student
Radio awards.
Does our student media really need the NUS to
thrive? What exactly does a group of politicians
have to offer student media? Are the NUS just
trying to pander to media clubs?

of debate was working conditions in
Columbia.

was no debate on the lecturers strike.

The NUS believes that Media Studies and
Sports Science students should get the
same funding as those who study Physics,
Engineering or Medicine.
Would it not be more sensible to tar-
get funding at those studying the hard
subjects the economy requires rather than
funding the more trendy courses that are
less well respected by employers?
Do we really want ICU to support a
fees policy that may not be in Imperial
students best interest?
