Clamp down on student behaviour
Students at many universities have
been forced to sign contracts to en-
sure good behaviour.
In Nottingham the two universi-
ties, Nottingham and Nottingham
Trent, have problems with the way
their students get along with their
neighbours. Drunkenness, vomit-
ing and half eaten food litter appear
to be the main irritants.
A spokesman for Nottingham
Trent university said: “To enhance
the relationship between student
and community, we actively support
the “Sshh” campaign – an initiative
designed to educate students of the
importance of remaining respectful
of the local communities and resi-
dents of Nottingham.
“The campaign aims to deal with
issues such as noise and litter but
to also encourage students to feel
part of the community rather than
separate from it.”
Whilst being educated, the stu-
dents are also required to sign a
contract just as students arriving at
Chester and Oxford University do.
One in six students drop out of
study at some point during their
course. Most drop outs come from
new universities, established after
1992. The cost to the taxpayer is es-
timated at around £50 million.
A spokesman for Chester Univer-
sity said: “It is our belief that a fair
balance should be struck between
the responsibilities of a university
to provide a quality standard edu-
cation, with well-qualified lectur-
ers and first-class facilities, and
reciprocal duties of students to par-
ticipate actively in their studies by
attending lectures, undertaking re-
quired preparation and submitting
work on time.
“The document is designed to
protect the legitimate needs of our
conscientious students, and to safe-
guard its resources from potentially
vexatious claims.”
Meanwhile Dr Gillian Howie, a
senior lecturer at the University of
Liverpool said: “Two league tables
giving a measure of university per-
formance are retention and qualify-
ing grades. There is an easily de-
monstrable relationship between
attendance and grades.
“We have to infantilise the young
adult to ensure that they attend to
secure their grades.
“In the main, these contracts try
to make explicit the fact that learn-
ing is not something that can be
bought and that it requires applica-
tion on the part of the student.”
There are voices of discontent on
the subject. Some believe universi-
ty should be a liberating experience
from the rigid rules set at school.
One of the most rewarding edu-
cational experiences of university
is commonly said to be the way stu-
dents must learn to balance their
social life and their study to suc-
ceed. The introduction of contracts
could water-down this experience
potentially leading to less well-
rounded graduates who are more
dependent upon rules others set for
them to follow.
This is potentially bad for top em-
ployers who generally prefer ap-
plicants who have a certain level of
independence and take initiatives
for themselves.
Marcel Berlins, a visiting profes-
sor of journalism at City University
in London said: “Most objection-
ably, they remove from students
the right to exercise any discretion,
to work out for themselves what’s
best for them, to be responsible by
their own volition and not because
they have been forced into it,”
Wes Streeting, NUS vice-presi-
dent for education was quick to
make a link with top up fees, he
said: “This is a clear knee-jerk re-
action to the introduction of top-up
fees, which may result in more stu-
dents making complaints as they
seek to ensure they get full value
for their £3,000.
“Our greatest worry is that
contracts could mean that stu-
dents have no course to redress
should they have a substandard
experience.
“The term ‘contract’ implies re-
sponsibilities on both sides. Un-
fortunately, while the contracts
we have seen outlined a number
of requirements for students, they
have remained vague on what is
required of universities in terms of
standards.”
This contrasted with Dr. Howie,
who commented: “During the last
10 years universities have been
subjected to extraordinary meas-
ures to prove and evidence quality
in teaching and research.
“Despite the fact that the length
of the working week exceeds that
which is recommended by Europe
and stress suffered by academic
staff is amongst the highest in the
country, we have remained com-
mitted and believe that education is
key to a vibrant economy and even
more importantly, to a flourishing
way of life. “

Study shows grades do not
reflect achievements
Anewsurveyhasshowntheamount
of time students from different uni-
versities have study to obtain the
same grades varies dramatically.
On average students from newer
universities have to spend far less
time at their studies than at older
institutions.
Scientists at Cambridge work 45
hours a week on course related ac-
tivities to obtain a top class degree,
compared to the 19 hours a week
required to gain a first or 2:1 at Uni-
versity of Central Lancashire.
The study, performed by the
Higher Education Policy Institute
(HEPI) also revealed that whilst
study-timevariedbetweensubjects,
an even greater variation came in
the differences between courses.
On average students claim to
spend 25.7 hours per week study-
ing, but medicine and dentistry stu-
dents work up to ten hours a week
more than the average, while mass
communication students study five
hours less than the average.
The study also focused on young-
er students. 15,000 first and second
year students were involved in the
study, which also asked questions
about the work trends of third and
fourth year students.
There are concerns that the de-
gree grades are not a fair represen-
tation of the achievements of stu-
dents on their courses. This could
cause skewed intake to employers
when students seek graduate jobs
after leaving university. Many in-
stitutions, particularly those con-
nected with the finance sector, use
grades as a screening method.
Hard-working students apply-
ing from scientific backgrounds at
older institutions, such as Imperial,
might be screened out, whilst less
hard-working students from newer
universities might get through the
initial screening procedures.
The finance sector employers
rarely entirely disregard students
with lower grades. Normally em-
ployers warn applicants severely
about the limited chance they have
of getting a job if they did not gain
at least a 2:1 at university. There
are real cases of applicants gain-
ing competitive positions, such as
at Investment Banks, without the
required grades. Such applicants
often have to resort to having some
sort of exceptional experience that
sells their talents and relegating
their degree grades to the bottom
of their CV just to get an interview.
Bahram Bekhradnia, of HEPI,
said: “If students are putting 32
hours a week into engineering and
21 hours a week into business stud-
ies, is a degree telling you the same
thing about the universities and the
experience the students have had?
You can get a 2:1 with different
amounts of effort.”
Drummond Bone, of the vice-
chancellors’ group Universities UK,
said: “There is no national curricu-
lum in higher education, and so we
should not be surprised that differ-
ent courses at different institutions
involve different use of facilities,
contact hours and so on.”
The authors also noted that 60.9
per cent of students of physical sci-
ences at Plymouth University re-
ceive a 2:1 or first-class degree for
working 20 hours a week.
National decline in
female applicants
Out of the 48,138 UK applicants who
applied for full-time study at uni-
versity by 15th October, there were
365 fewer women.
The trend is only an early indica-
tion; the deadline for application is
15th January. Some feel the trend is
worrying since increases in student
numbers in recent years have been
mainly due to an increasing number
of female students, who now consti-
tute around 55% of the UK total.
The early deadlines are for Ox-
bridge applicants whose numbers
rose by 4.3%, apparently showing
an “immunity” to top up fee devel-
opments. The figures also show a
3.6% rise in foreign applicants with
applicants from Poland up 28.5%.
The chief executive of UCAS, An-
thony McClaran, said: “On balance,
these first figures for 2007 entry are
encouraging.”
Higher Education Minister, Bill
Rammell said: “These figures show
the underlying trend in applica-
tions, after the small reduction last
year and following a larger than
usual increase the year before, con-
tinues to be upward.
“The critics of the new fees sys-
tem, who claimed applications
would plummet, are being proved
wrong.”
The “small reduction” he referred
to was the fall of the 2006 induction
by 15,000 students. This put his
claims about the new fee system
into question.
Applicants to England from
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ire-
land were down 9%, 2.1% and 4.3%.
Gemma Tumelty, President of
NUS said that the government had
portrayed the fall applications as “a
glitch”, and added: “We genuinely
hope they are right. We do not wish
to see any more students missing
out on the benefits a degree educa-
tion can bring,
“They may be able to pass off this
year’s drop in applications as a one-
off, but two years in a row would be
a clear and undeniable reflection of
the negative impact that top-up fees
are having on participation rates.”
Graduates at Central Lancashire
Female students are already
scarce at Imperial College
An appeal
Felix is planning to look at the
effects British foreign policy is
having on students at college.
If you are an Imperial College
student who is also a Palastin-
ian, Israeli, Iraqi, Iranian of Af-
gahni national, and would value
the chance to take part in the
investigation, then we would
like to hear from you.
Feel free to send an email
to David Ellis at news.felix@
ic.ac.uk. We look forward to
hearing from you soon.
