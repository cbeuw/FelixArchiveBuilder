The financial arrangements sur-
rounding the NUS affiliation fee and
the legacy of leaving the University
of London Union (ULU) were re-
vealed this week.
The sabbs were briefed about the
possible cost projections a week
ago, but were told that the infor-
mation was to be kept confidential,
as “it concerned an ongoing ne-
gotiation between two, if you like,
corporate identities,” in the words
of Jon Matthews, Deputy President
(Finance & Services). The figures
appear to have leaked to numer-
ous non-sabbaticals. Mr Matthews,
when asked if the figures had been
made available in the past, stated
that he believed so, but did not
know in what committee or what
paper they had been made avail-
able. Ashley Brown, Live! editor,
attempted to locate these figures in
Union minutes and papers, which
are available online, but was unable
to do so.
The figures are divided into two
parts. The first set of figures con-
cerns the affiliation fee the Union
will have to pay if the student body
votes to join the NUS in the upcom-
ing referendum. This number is
based on the money the Union re-
ceives from the College to provide
its services (called the subvention)
and the number of students who
are members of the Union, and is
capped at £52,000.
The second part of the figures
concerns the fee the Union must
pay ULU as part of the withdrawl
agreement. Although the College
is to be awarded its own degree-
awarding powers separate from the
University of London (UL), it will
still have students on degrees affili-
ated with UL, and therefore must
continue to pay a fee to ULU to use
the services they provide.
The figures reveal that the first
year cost of the NUS affiliation fee
is predicted to be £35,000, and that
the fee paid to ULU will be £78,000.
As College pays this fee directly to
ULU, that will leave the Union need-
ing to find £35,000 to cover the NUS
fee. Whether or not the College will
step in to help carry this financial
burden is not clear yet, and John
Collins, the Union President, has
been meeting with College officials,
including the Rector, Sir Richard
Sykes, and the Deputy Rector, Sir
Leszek Borysiewicz to discuss this
possibility.
The second year’s figures show
the ULU fee dropping to £45,000
from £78,000, while the NUS figure
increases to around £42,000 from
£35,000. These figures do not in-
clude additional costs, such as the
replacement of services that were
once provided by ULU, predicted
by Mr Collins on questioning by Fe-
lix to be “around £10-15k”. It also
does not include the likely income
from sales of the NUS Extra card.
£4 of every £10 card sold is return
to the participating Union. To cover
the above cost, the NUS Extra card
would have to be bought by more
than a quarter of the student body,
something that seems unlikely giv-
en IC student apathy and the nega-
tive feeling that the Extra card has
generated among many students’
unions, with the NUS actively at-
tempting to block students without
the Extra card from receiving the
Extra discount.
Mr Collins stressed that the even-
tual departure from ULU would
pay for the NUS affiliation fee, and
cover the loss made in the hypo-
thetical first two years of NUS af-
filiation. As the ULU affiliation fee
decreases over time, the NUS af-
filiation will increase to the cap of
£52,000, likely to be reached within
three years. Assuming all students
at the College currently on UL de-
grees will have completed these
within five years, Felix’s back-of-an-
envelope calculations suggest that
after three years, the Union begins
to break even, compared to simply
paying for the ULU affiliation fee.
Mr Collins also promised that
NUS affiliation would bring savings
in the training of Union officers of
“a few thousand pounds,” further
off-setting the initial expense.
Mr Collins did point out that the
Union has a sizeable cash reserve
(estimated at around £1m), as well
as numerous other contigency
funds it can draw upon to pay the
fee. However, this cash reserve is
currently set aside to cover the cost
of the Union redevelopment, which
is estimated to have cost £1.25m so
far. Mr Collins said that the College
should be footing the bill when it ar-
rives, but the money has not been
provided yet.
This reporter would like to re-
mind its readers that Felix is bound
by the Union constitution’s regula-
tions on referenda, and therefore
is not permitted to hold an official
opinion on the NUS referendum.
This reporter would also like to
remind readers that the Union’s
constitution requires that you think
before you vote.
