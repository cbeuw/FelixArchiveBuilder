Mayhem on freshers’ hockey tour
Late in the evening of 20th October,
around 30 hockey players piled into
two minibuses and headed for Shep-
ton Mallet, Somerset. Fortunately
only one minibus was harmed in the
course of this adventure! High spir-
its were maintained through the 6
hour bus journey; with the help of
a large bottle of vodka and runs
round the coach on the motorway.
Moans of “I really need to pee!”
were frequently heard from one of
the party and some small children
were mentally scarred by our signs,
how could you Dan? We arrived
very late at a small primary school
hall and set about making our ‘beds’
for the evening. We all sat in a circle
with sweets and tea (and red wine
in some cases) and discussed the
plan of events for the weekend.
Next morning, cold and sleepy, the
teams prepared for a day of mixed
hockey playing, and of course,
drinking. After a couple of hours
on the pitch, we made our way to a
sleepy little pub for our curry and
skittles lunch. At this point Shiv
decided she didn’t like the blue bus
very much; showing her disgust by
scraping it against a wall. (Note,
licking your fingers and wiping the
scratch does not bring the paint
back!)
The highlight of the afternoon
was when Jack’s parents asked him
where his bar name, “Daterape”,
came from. After a brief stop at
some shops to purchase our white
T-shirts for the evening and to deco-
rate them in style, we were ready to
hit the town!
It may be a long time before Wells
forget Imperial College Hockey
club. Funny stories include: Shiv
hurling with extreme precision into
a glass, scandal as two nameless in-
dividuals took a friendly stroll down
a back alley, a certain male fresher
getting far too drunk and rolling in
various hedges on the way home,
an elegant female fresher taking a
wee stop behind a fence and Roxy
demanding a kebab “even if it is
made of horse!”.
Unsurprisingly, hockey the next
day was a little less than balanced.
There were many cries of “I’m go-
ing to throw up!” and one poor fool
fell in the mud on the way to the
hockey pitch! This gave the opposi-
tion a slight advantage and both IC
teams lost, unfortunately. However,
we all happily clambered back into
our buses for the journey back and
promptly fell into drunken, but con-
tented sleep!
Fresh blood helps ensure Rugby 1st XV victory
It wasn’t a normal start for the 1st
XV this week, with a reshuffle of the
team that included seven new faces
on the starting team sheet, and the
shock news that we would have to
take public transport to a game for
the first time since my arrival at uni-
versity. And this meant that there
were no excuses for being late! As
usual, few people arrived on time to
meet at the union; some even forgot
to read their emails and had a quick
dash to South Kensington tube to
meet up. But get there we did and
we were on our way to play GKT,
a side that has been in the league
with us for some time now.
Upon arrival, the team had to
travel through some shrubbery be-
fore finally emerging at the sports
ground and the changing room.
Everyone was in a some what sub-
dued mood after the disappointing
performance last week, and so we
were ready to prove to ourselves
how good we can be. The warm up
went smoothly. We were all fired up
for the game and then we realised
that there was a mile trek to get to
the actual pitch!
From the kick off, IC scored a
quick try through Mike, who sim-
ply glided and then ran away from
the GKT defence, but this wasn’t
the last time GKT would see Mike,
as he went on to score a further
two more tries in the half and thus
impressing his lady friend that ac-
companied him to the match. GKT
did however manage to get one try
in the first half, with a simple catch
and drive from the lineout, some-
thing which they are well known for
doing, but before the end of the half
IC got a further try through Nathan
to make the score at half time 22 – 8
to IC.
The second half started just the
same as it did in the first, except
Flannan wasn’t on the pitch, but
was instead having a little sulk on
the side line for being taken off to
give the fresher James Pettit a run.
Throughout the half, IC continued
with their mouvement général
whilst GKT were unable to stop the
smooth, fast flowing, slick move-
ment from both the forwards and
backs. But GKT continued with
their own catch and drive, getting
a further two tries before the IC
forwards figured out how to stop
them.
IC were playing to a great stand-
ard, with great co-operation be-
tweentheforwardsandbackswhich
resulted in a further three tries in
the half, with old man Andjit get-
ting two and James Pettit getting
the other, leading to a final score
of 25-39 to IC. There were some
great performances from Dan ‘not
so little’ Godfrey who managed to
take two guys out with his massive
tackles, and also from ‘Man of the
Match’ Remi who was quick and
decisive over the field. In fact it was
generally a massive improvement
from last week, with even the for-
wards getting their act together.
The return journey turned out to
be a rather enjoyable one for both
sides, as we got the same train
back, but one must feel a little sorry
for the members of the poor gen-
eral public who foolishly decided to
get onto our carriage. GKT started
off the festivities with ‘sing fresher
sing’ to which their freshers obliged
by serenading everyone to classics
line Angel. This for some reason
prompted our own freshers, Jo,
Alex, Jim and James, to do their
own rendition of ‘Build me up But-
tercup’, which cheered up Flannan
a bit!
