I, Gamer
W
ar, then. You’d
be forgiven for
thinking that
Felix Games
is choosing
themes by virtue of how easy it
is to write comedic headlines for
them, but with Company of He-
roes still holding its own in the
UK charts, and Call of Duty 3
coming to consoles over the next
few weeks, war is on the mind of
the UK gamer once more.
A lot of the time, realism in
games is a secondary issue. Does
a headcrab splat convincingly
when hit with a crowbar in Half-
Life 2? Have they really modelled
the walking mech suits correctly
in Battlefield 2142? Designers of-
ten claim that ‘if reality was that
much fun, people wouldn’t play
games,’ but certain kinds of re-
ality are very close to a gamer’s
heart.
Thankfully, I’ve not experienced
real war yet. And unless some sci-
fi prophecies start ringing true,
it’s unlikely I’ll ever have to take
up arms for my country – or in-
deed, my planet – in my lifetime.
So maybe when creating a game
that’s as visceral and hard-hitting
as Call of Duty 3, it’s acceptable to
go for the easy shocks, to rewrite
the path of history with a few Hol-
lywood set-pieces?
Or maybe it’s here that reality
becomes more important than
ever. Because just as we struggle
to record the experiences of war
veterans before the last of them
pass away, we also have a duty
to communicate them to new
generations in an accurate way.
War shouldn’t be a skip and a hop
through the exciting parts, with
the trials and tribulations missed
out. If we’re not telling the story
properly, then we may as well
not tell it at all. There’s a reason
why people play Call of Duty over
Unreal Tournament – they want
reality.
And it’s this perhaps, more
than war, that is this week’s fo-
cus. With the release of Medieval
2, real-time strategy and history
textbooks collide more beauti-
fully than ever before.
Maybe it’s sad in some cases
that we’re striving to put reality
in games so that we don’t have to
go out and live life for ourselves?
It’s possible that that’s what con-
tributes most to the stereotype of
the reclusive gamer. But at the
same time, it’s also so that we
can show to others what more
terrible things are, without them
having to go through the horror
itself. Is that a good thing? Get in
touch.

War games follow war games, but what is it good for, anyway, asks Michael Cook
Silence, at first. The lapping of the
sea against metal. Your first con-
notation, as Gamer, is that of the
seaside. The gentle summer. With-
out warning, we fade in to a sea-
side that definitely is not Brighton
promenade.
Maybe it was Half-Life fading in
people’s memories, or maybe it was
simply the first-person shooter well
on its way to becoming the most
popular genre in gaming. What-
ever the reason, the Omaha Beach
Landings in Medal Of Honor: Allied
Assault became a defining moment
for videogaming this decade.
Whilst watching a scientist get
mauled by a team of scripted sol-
diers was one thing, having the
technique used to tell a story of real
soldiers, real divisions, real events,
was something else entirely. Story-
led gaming, in that moment, took a
huge leap forward.
Skip a few generations of gaming
on, and World War Two seems to be
stumbling somewhat. Call of Duty
does D-Day, and… it’s a bit like
Medal of Honor. Call of Duty 2 does
D-Day, and it’s also a bit like Medal
of Honor. But with more cliffs. Is
War still hell? Or has it just become
mildly irritating?
World War Two has a lot of sto-
ries on offer, and most development
companies are good at finding new
ones to revisit. Call of Duty might
return to the beaches of France,
but at least it had the decency to
change venue. Company of Heroes
not only gives us a different view-
point – this time from a real-time
strategy context – but it also strug-
gles to give a different feel to shoot-
ing members of the same army over
and over again. Call of Duty 2 takes
you through Africa with the Desert
Time to expand your sim-ple tastes
The add-on culture lives on with The Sims. But can it really go on for much longer?
You know what I like about cheese?
I mean, there are plenty of things
I like about cheese, don’t get me
wrong. The main thing I like about
it is that when I’ve bought some
cheese, I know that the cheese is
going to be there should I come and
need some. And I’m vaguely aware
that I could make my own cheese
using a few simple ingredients,
some time, and some skill.
To leave the cheese metaphor
at the roadside (I think we can all
agree that it’s done its bit), there
are no expansion packs for cheddar.
If I want a different experience, or
something new, or just more of the
same, then I go out and buy some
more cheese. No matter what I do,
it’s still the same dairy product.
Maybe the availability of new
games is what’s making us so bit-
ter about the stream of expansion
packs to The Sims and its sequel.
Once upon a time, expansion packs
were almost a necessity, they were
expected to come as the developers
had finished the hard task of coding
and someone out there could actu-
ally sit down and design something
fun and challenging. Art once again imitating life
Rats or drops you in the middle of
the defence of Russia. Pacific As-
sault in the Medal Of Honor se-
ries took us to the other side of the
world, breathing life into battles not
seen or fought by gamers before.
It’s interesting to look at Half-Life
– often seen as the classic example
of first-person gaming used to tell
an emotive story – and consider
why it and its successor had such
an impact. What are the memora-
ble segments of Half-Life 2? Is it the
gun battles that were fought in the
Water Hazard chapter? Is it fending
off the army of headcrabs at the bot-
tom of Ravenholm’s mineshaft? Or
are these experiences secondary to
the power of meeting Dog for the
first time, to stepping out of the sta-
tion at City 17 in the introductory se-
quence, to seeing Alyx and Barney
chat with each other and respond
convincingly? What you find is that,
whilst the fight sequences and the
high-octane action was enjoyable,
we also remember the quiet mo-
ments as being just as important in
terms of telling a story.
And telling a story is what war
gaming is about. Band of Broth-
ers did nothing particularly new in
terms of special effects when it was
aired on the BBC. But what it of-
fered in comparison to Saving Pri-
vate Ryan or A Bridge Too Far was
a feel of the evolution of a unit. The
fallen soldiers didn’t respawn at
the start of the next battle – some-
thing that crippled the immersion
of Brothers In Arms. Nor were the
names just placeholders for real
Quick! It’s Generic Soldier 4 - and he’s in trouble! Are we losing an emotive connection with our games?
personalities – you were witnessing
real men, the stories of people who
were still alive today to tell their
tale.
Maybe World War 2 is a theme
that can’t be overdone. IL Sturmo-
vik, Battlefield 1942, Medal Of Hon-
or 2 – these games range from mas-
sively multiplayer, through to air
simulation. They cover topics from
the defence of Russia to the French
resistance. Perhaps there is a vari-
ety available that can be exploited
indefinitely. But unless developers
such as Treyarch learn that explo-
sions and accents alone don’t make
a compelling experience, war gam-
ing will remain just a game. Soon,
there won’t be anyone left to point
out the difference between reality,
and our experience of it.
But then people decided that
they’d rather have more. More
graphics advances, more sophisti-
cated artificial intelligence, shorter
production cycles, higher produc-
tion values. Less controls, more
control. More to master, less to
learn. As the demands rose, the
need to constantly rejuvenate not
only the level design, but also the
technology surrounding the game,
became immense. Expansion
packs were delayed by six months
and turned into sequels, and soon
the practice of creating standalone
mission packs became the reserve
of epic role-playing games and
games which were cut short in the
first place to meet release dates.
Until The Sims, of course.
Livin’ Large, House Party, Hot
Date, Unleashed – at first, the
packs seemed sensible. Then ob-
scure. And then it was quite clear
who they were pandering to. Maxis
had found their target market like
a particularly obvious piece of Red
Leicester in a vat of Stilton. Girls
played the Sims. A lot of girls.
And we’re not generalising here;
it’s true to say that The Sims and
The Sims 2 has become a game
largely played by girl gamers. And
as noted in Felix Science this is-
sue, gaming demographics are a
tricky business. It turned out that
Sims players didn’t just want to
buy expansion packs for the hell of
it. They also enjoyed the way it let
them play.
Expansion Packs for games such
as The Sims – a game without mis-
sions to speak of in the first place
– means adding new items, occu-
pations, abilities and things to see.
It’s about expanding the game uni-
verse, and giving the player more
things to tinker with. To most gam-
ers, it seems like money-grabbing.
But to the community of The Sims
– and as communities go, it’s one of
the largest and most dedicated on
the net, churning out hundreds of
user-created bits and bobs each day
– the expansion pack gives them
a way of customising their playing
environment, and filling the toybox
with new things.
Your average player won’t like it.
But the way The Sims uses expan-
sion packs is unique and brilliant.
At the end of the day, not even the
most suggestible gamer will play a
game that isn’t fun. So the question
is this – can 16.8 million gamers be
that wrong?
