Despite the name,
it is actually quite
a nice little venue
which is the size of
a living room. It is
a bit of a walk down
some back roads
away from the
main Shoreditch
area. They do how-
ever put on nice
electronic drone/noise shows on there with
the promoters called De Sonis, you have to
get there early since the capacity is 50.
Livin’ it up in the east side
feature femm 10
Friday 10th November 2006
It is full of art students, bad haircuts and
tight-fitting garments. So naturally it is a hive
for numerous musos and brilliant, small gigs,
Femm takes you on a magical journey through
London’s East End. We cover Shoreditch,
Brick Lane and Hoxton; the epicentre of
the avant garde. Matty Hoban leads the
exploration and confusion at the newly
invented ‘New Rave’ scene, which doesn’t
really exist. There are also thousands of noise-
rock shows and art galleries to choose from.
E
ast London is synony-
mous with vibrance, di-
versity and contemporary
culture. Where South
Kensington is cultured
in a traditional and stuffy
sense of the word. You
won’t find many small
gigs with exciting new music in the Royal
Borough that often. I heartily suggest you
get to know the other side of the Capital as
soon as possible. Here’s a short guide of
places where exciting things are happen-
ing at certain venues. This guide is done
by postcode to break everything down.
EC1
333
333 Old Street
EC1V 9LE
It is essentially a nightclub for the art
school crowd who like their artful dance-
noise. One of the places to have spawned
the so-called ‘New Rave’ scene as it has
nights that play noise, avant garde mixed
withelectroandwhateveriscoolthatweek.
It’s all a bit of fun really, just don’t take it
all too seriously. Go to www.333mother.
com for more information.
EC2
The Old Blue Last
39 Great Eastern Road,
EC2A 3ES
Just round the
way from Old
Street station,
this dark pub
has a delight-
fully shabby
upstairs which
hosts many a
fine show. Bands
such as Foals
who are too elec-
tro for school have been playing their re-
cently. Promoters such as Unluck Recs
have been putting on gigs with a slant to-
wards noise recently. The Arctic Monkeys
also played here many a moon ago. The
venue has gained note for its cheap hire
cost, so cheaper gigs, which can only be a
good thing.
Plastic People
147-149 Curtain Rd
EC2A 3QE
Once home to the club night And Did We
Mention Our Disco but now that night no
longer exists. It has become a bit of a cen-
tre for the combination of repetitive dance
rhythms and electro combined with guitars.
Guitar music which you can dance to is not
a new thing but it was done especially well
there. You can have a look at what else they
have on at www.plasticpeople.co.uk.
E1
93 Feet East
150 Brick Lane
E1 6QL
On Brick Lane
along with a multi-
tude of beigels, you
will find this venue.
It has a plethora
of great music and
has a lovely outdoor
bit on the cobbled
streets that Brick
Lane is renowned
for. It is a quite a big
complex of rooms with a nice atmosphere as
can be seen on the website, www.93feeteast.
co.uk, and you can take the virtual tour. The
music is varied and can range from all varie-
ties of the experimental.
Vibe Bar
The Old Truman Brewery, 91 Brick Lane
E1 6QL
Again on the cobbled road that is Brick Lane
you can find in an old brewery yard, the en-
trance to the Vibe Bar. This venue has a
main room which has some sort of a stage
and does look a bit yuppie. There is also a
back room with some drapes and curtains.
It is an unusual venue in that it bears the
appearance of somewhere to go listen to
‘ambient’ house, yet there have been some
very alternative shows put on there. Worth
a visit when there’s a gig on, such as every
third Tuesday in the week when A Badge of
Friendship bring their free shows of alterna-
tive and noise-rock.
Spitz
109 Commercial St
Old Spitalfields Market
E1 6BG
A venue, bistro and
gallery, Spitz can
be found to put on
Jazz acts to anti-
folk in the upcom-
ing Herman Dune
show. Probably a
venue that reflects
the cosmopolitan
nature of the East
End very well. Ad-
mittedly, I haven’t been to many gigs at Spitz
but when I have been, I have enjoyed them
immensely and I found the atmosphere
quite relaxing. Low are to play there early
next year, but it is already sold out, so it is
pretty pointless me telling you.
Gramaphone
60-62 Commercial St
E1 6LT
I only recently discovered this bar with
an underground venue. It again has a bar
which looks like it is frequented by yuppies
and bar prices reflecting their clientele. The
venue is quite nice and intimate but there
aren’t many shows at their of note but when
there is, check it out.
E2
Fleapit
49 Columbia Road
E2 7RG
Catch
22 Kingsland Road
E2 8DA
It has a bit of a brown and bland exterior
but fear not as this boozer has been known
to put on some very good shows. The near-
est tubes are Old Street and Shoreditch. It
can be quite hard to find out what is going
on so just going there can be one of the
easiest ways. However, if you have a snoop
around enough you’ll find that a lot of an-
gular indie and alt-rock gigs can be found
at Catch or Catch 22 as I (and a few other
misguided people) call it. It is part of the
East london show experience in my opin-
ion as I do love guitar music.
N1
Hoxton Bar and Grill
2-4 Hoxton Square
N1 6NU
A pretty grim
venue if I’m go-
ing to be honest.
This venue was
newly used by
Plum Promo-
tions who used to
put on shows at
the Water Rats
and put some
on at Betsey
Trotwood. There will be the occasionally
good band playing but often it is ear-fod-
der. This venue is for bands that are a bit
gritty and could potentially be something
but still are stuck in the toilet circuit. So if
you want to see them whilst they’re still
small and then show off about it later, go
to the Hoxton Bar and Grill.
Hoxton Bar and Grill
2-4 Hoxton Square
N1 6NU
The Macbeth has a lot of noise-rock and
angular indie-rock shows organised by
the likes of Chaos Vs. Cosmos (the mem-
bers of the band Collapse). It is also very
good for the odd free Sunday avant-garde
gig with various arty ventures going on. I
wish I went here more.
Brick Lane where you can pick up some tasty, late night bagels
