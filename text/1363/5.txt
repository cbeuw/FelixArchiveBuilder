Dawn of a gaming revolution
Whilst you might hear plenty about
gaming’s conquering of the mass
market and its final acceptance by
the majority – indeed, you may even
hear it from Felix’s own games sec-
tion – it isn’t quite that simple. Yes,
plenty of people play games, but
are plenty of people gaming? Felix
talks to Owain Bennallack, editorial
director of gaming website Pocket-
Gamer.co.uk, about gaming and its
acceptance in society. Are we all ac-
tually playing along?
What do you think of the Game
On exhibition as a kind of turning
point in gaming’s acceptance?
I haven’t actually been to the lat-
est Game On, but I think it’s a good
idea. I went to the original one back
in the Barbican, and it’s interest-
ing to see an art institution behind
something like that. I think people
have been talking about games in
a cultural sense for some time, but
it was definitely an interesting mo-
ment – perhaps turning point is a bit
strong, but important nevertheless.
Do you think that the exhibition is
more about the past then, or the
future?
WhenIwalkaroundtheScienceMu-
seum, I think about the future. What
it does is it illuminates the present,
in the same way that science fiction
does. Even though you’re looking at
something like Defender, and then
Ghost Recon, you’re being made
aware that this medium that was
seen as quite quirky and hidden is
actually following a timeline of its
own, and there’s no reason it’s not
going to keep progressing.
You’re a fan of Guitar Hero?
Definitely a fan of the idea, I don’t
think I’m any good at it though!
What do you think gives it, and
games like it, such an appeal?
Well I think it’s interesting in gen-
eral when you marry a real world

Felix talks to Owain Bennallack from Pocket Gamer about a whole new gaming world
artefact to gameplay. It can never
be underestimated how much peo-
ple are turned off by joysticks and
keyboards. If you talk to a non-gam-
er and ask them if they want to play
a game, they might say no. But if
you ask them if they want to dance
on a dancemat, or shake maracas,
or hold a guitar and play it, they’ll
say: “Yeah, of course, because I
know how to play a guitar.” They
don’t want to go and learn how to do
something, they just want to have
fun. Everyone gets music, and eve-
ryone can instantly relate to some-
thing like Guitar Hero.
The controller on the Nintendo
Wii is something quite simplified
too. Is that a sign that there’s
some realisation of this?
You really can’t go simple enough.
The Wii controller is, to an extent,
a barrier of its own. But it’s more
intrinsically fun too, because you’re
following around with its actions
somewhat. I mean, bemused girls
– bemused gamers – are going to
want to play a backhand on the Wii
tennis games, and they won’t be
able to because of the way it works.
It’s still a step forward.
The girl gamer demographic defi-
nitely seems like the biggest target
for companies to grab.
The problem the industry has in
general is that people get into gam-
ing when they’re young males, and
it becomes a flatter consumption as
those gamers get older. So to keep
the market expanding, you’ve got
to look for new demographics. But I
think there’s something inherently
masculine about the existing game
mechanics – learn to beat this, over-
come this challenge, be rewarded
with something that helps you get
on. There will be gamers that disa-
gree with that, but I think it’s an in-
herently masculine mindset.
But in many ways, this is an old
issue. There are stats now that Nin-
tendogs has sold in Germany and in
the UK, around 50% of those many,
many copies to women.
There was a time when you could
tell you were in a highbrow dis-
cussion if someone mentioned the
word ‘demographic’ and ‘gaming’
in the same context. Gaming was
its own demographic – there wasn’t
so much a supply and demand
relationship as there was a para-
sitic one. Gamers waited for the
games, and then when they arrived
the gamers would play them and
wait for more games. Nowadays
it seems – for financial reasons or
other – that demographics is one of
the bigger puzzles in gaming.
As part of the Science Museum’s
ongoing events schedule, Nicolas
Rodriguez from Kuju Studios gave
a talk last week entitled “Dance-
mats And Joysticks – Who’s Play-
ing Now?” In it, he charted the rise
and development of game control
mechanisms, and talked about the
barriers that were now set up to
new gamers. “In the past, gaming
was simple,” he explains, flicking
up a simple button-and-paddle sys-
tem onto a projector, “you move the
paddle, you press the button and
aliens die.”
The important thing, Rodriguez
says, is that we understand what
we’re doing. “There’s a one-to-one
relationship between what we do
with a controller and what happens
on the screen. That’s why games
like Guitar Hero work. You tell peo-
ple they have to play the guitar, give
them a peripheral and…” he mimes
a few power chords on a well-mod-
elled air guitar, “…they know what
to do.”
Crucially, he explains, the reason
that the games industry doesn’t see
the problem is because they grew
up with the problem. Keyboards
and joysticks aren’t just techniques
that the industry has got used to,
it’s something that is genuinely
thought of as the best solution.
Steel Battalion’s release in both the
EasternandWesternmarketscame
with the largest controller known to
gamers at the time, with around
40 buttons and two joysticks. But
as Rodriguez explains, part of the
game becomes the control system
itself. And mastering it is not some-
thing many gamers want to do.
“What I want to ask is: has the
controller become a barrier to in-
novation and new gamers?”
It seems like a distinct possibil-
ity. The key problem – picked up
by many others in the industry – is
that gaming got too obsessed with
itself, and with its romantic notion
of sweaty teenagers in their bed-
rooms. Far from being something
they shied away from, they em-
braced it. There was a thrill in the
hard-core, the complicated. Joy-
sticks became glorified, and t-shirts
now bear the long strings of button
combinations from famous game
cheat codes.
But as time goes on, it comes
around to bite gaming in the rear.
The key is to get people who
aren’t gaming into this market
Is that a misnomer then? Is there
only one type of ‘gamer’, or are
we looking at different kinds of
players?
Already you can see the market
fragmenting for traditional games
– people who play FPSs don’t nec-
essarily want to go out and play
platform games. In the past, two
people with an Atari 2600 would
have played similar games. But as
games diversify, Quake fans are
now a world away from Singstar
fans. They’re different audiences,
and they all want different things
from a game. The main issue is to
get people who can think in new
ways to make games.

Is it finally game over for the fat controller?

A biog
One of just three Europeans
placed in a recent top 50 Most
Influential Games Journalists
survey by Next Generation,
Owain Bennallack started his
career at Future Publishing.
He soon moved on to a stint
as deputy editor of videogame
culture giant Edge, before spe-
cialising in the games devel-
opment side of the industry.
Owain edited the European
developer magazine, Develop,
from its inception in 2001 until
February 2006, leaving to set
up publishing company Steel
Media. Now running Pocket-
Gamer.co.uk, a site dedicated
to handheld and mobile gam-
ing, he also chairs the Develop
In Brighton Conference advi-
sory board, and still finds time
for consultancy projects with
several leading developers and
games publications.
Owain’s first experience of
journalism however was here
at IC, where he cut his teeth on
Felix. Spurning the fourth year
of his Computer Science de-
gree, he was Felix editor 1994-
5, which in those days also
meant running and in-house
printing press business, with
full-time staff. He considers the
whole experience ‘absolutely
valuable’ and points out that his
immediate IC media contem-
poraries include BBC TV pre-
senter Declan Curry and New
Scientist features editor David
Cohen, plus a host of others
who now work as freelance or
staff editors and journalists.

which is still a newcomer at only a
few decades old. But as you do that,
the market changes. Is the aim to
bring new gamers into old hobbies,
or to create a different kind of gam-
er? Rodriguez thinks that the solu-
tion comes in getting people to try
the medium out. “People move on.
They might start on Nintendogs,
but they’re going to end up playing
Trauma Centre and other games.”
Rodriguez sums up the division
quite neatly, against the backdrop of
a painting of a street, with children
skipping and playing ball games.
“Some of us don’t want to game,”
he says. “Some of us just want to
play.”
With the next generation of gam-
ing on our doorstep, those people
may have more opportunities than
ever. But it’s still a topic of discus-
sion, and one that the Science Mu-
seum and Game On hope to consid-
er over the coming weeks, as they
discuss the psychology, the brand
names and the challenges of mod-
ern gaming.
