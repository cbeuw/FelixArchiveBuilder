G
ood evening disco
dwellers! Hope you
enjoy the page this
week and every sin-
gle one of you enters
the competition, as it’s a guaran-
teed great night out, I swear! I’m
going to dedicate the rest of this
column to a vitriolic rant, enjoy.
As you will read in our review of
this weekend’s entertainment at
Fabric, last weekend was some-
what of a let-down for your poor
nightlife editor, as my excursion
to Fabric was cut rather short.
Well, not ‘short’ exactly, since I
did spend a significant portion of
Friday evening standing in the
frost-bound wasteland that is
Farringdon. Although tantalising-
ly close to the entrance after an
hour and a half in the queue, we
had to say enough is enough and
make our sorry way home after
being warned of at least another
45 minutes waiting, which would
have pushed the total queuing
time up to the whopping two and
a quarter hours!
All in all, I didn’t mind too much,
since I was kept entertained by
my lovely friends in the queue
(on another note: I’ve been told I
have to apologise for claiming my
house’s strobe light as my own
in last week’s issue, since only a
quarter of the feeble black box is
owned by me) and, of course, it
was sort of my fault for arriving
so late in the first place, if thirty
minutes after the club opens
could be considered ‘late’. What
did annoy me however is the
circumstances surrounding this
gargantuan queue.
Fabric had decided not to sell
advance tickets for this event, so
only members of their paid sub-
scription scheme Fabric First
could be guaranteed quick and
easy entry. Sure, this rewards loy-
alty and that’s good to an extent,
but they certainly didn’t need any
of that to attract people to this
night. What the scheme really
does is alienate people who have
come for the music rather than
the club itself, which is surely a
better reason for going.
After having stood in the same
spot in the regular queue for 40
minutes, my friends and I were
asked by a person in the Fabric
First queue “is this a drum and
bass night?”, which sums up my
sentiments quite concisely.
I love you really though, Fabric!
It’s party
time once
again!

Hooray, so we’re back at Fabric
again, only this time it’s a Friday
night, and I can drink to my heart’s
content. These guys have really
been treating us recently, with Ad-
ventures In The Beetroot Field the
week before, which if you read the
review last week you’ll know was
amazing, followed so closely by the
mighty Radio Soulwax Weekender,
which your dedicated reviewers
managed to get over to and check
out last Friday, and yes – it was su-
per sweet.
On arrival, I must say that this
was definitely by far the most popu-
lar event I’d ever seen happening at
Fabric, the main queue stretched
all the way back to Farringdon
tube station (which is a very long
way indeed) with some dedicated
fans waiting for up to 2 hours just
to get in. Our beloved Alex unfortu-
nately was one of them, but he de-
cided to give up after an hour and a
half when some guy from the huge
crowd of Fabric First members
being allowed to join the queue in
front of everyone else asked if it
was a DnB night.
This event was definitely as popu-
lar as the Radio Soulwax event at
Canvas a few months previously
and, despite the huge queues, I
must say it was seriously better
organised, since once entering
the club you could actually move
around, and they didn’t oversell it
by 50% resulting in loads of people
who had already bought tickets not
actually getting in (at least the peo-
ple who went home disappointed on
Friday hadn’t also wasted £25).
Anyway, enough about that and
on with the actual club review. We
managed to get in just before mid-
night which unfortunately meant
we missed a few acts including the
hilarious Uffie doing a live set with
her French DJ boyfriend Feadz.
Based upon what she delivered the
last time I saw her playing live (and
her horrendous new tracks Hot
Chick and In Charge) I wasn’t too
upset at missing her. Despite this,
we were lucky enough to catch the
end of the Our Disco DJs’ set which,
by the looks of how packed the room
was for them, must have been pret-
ty awesome. What we heard of it
certainly confirmed this, since they
pretty much played all my favourite
tracks in a row (I can’t wait for De-
cember 1st when they return). They
were a perfect support for Soulwax,
setting an awesome atmosphere in
the main room.
Now, since I’d seen Soulwax
Niteversions at the Reading Fes-
tival last year I knew what to ex-
pect: they were performing their
Niteversions remix album live, but
having seen them before made no
difference, the sound and lighting
at Fabric were much better than
Reading, as was the atmosphere.
They were set up on stage in front
of their trademark pink and white
stripy background, with big spot
lamps behind them, shining out to
the crowd. Room One was totally
packed out with gyrating masses
of people dancing to the guitar-led
electro and I must say it was pretty
damn fun. They performed all the
tracks from the album, mixed to-
gether in the correct order which
was nice, since you knew what to
expect (I don’t like surprises) and
the only thing that was a bit strange
about their set is that they didn’t in-
clude any of the female vocals like
they did at Reading, which made
tracks like E-Talking and NY Ex-
cuse sound a bit weird. Oh well,
they were great and they are still
great.
We decided to hang around in
Room One some more, to catch
MUSTAPHA 3000 aka Erol Alkan
play one of his sets. It was nice and
pretty similar to the one he played
at the Escape Festival in Wales,
much more electro in style than his
Trash sets (predictably) although
there were a few remixes of some
indie type tracks in there. At least
I think so, although to be honest I
don’t remember a single track he
played, but we stayed around until
2am so it can’t have been that bad!
When 2am finally came, it was
time for Vitalic, delivering his fu-
turistic style of uber-electro. This
was going to be good! We arrived
just in time for the start of his set;
the room was completely packed
to maximum capacity, although we
managed to push forwards into the
middle, it was a bit of a squeeze.
He was standing on stage with
only his face visible, lit up with blue
UV lights reflecting off his shiny
bald head behind a big translucent
screen with crazy moving images
projected onto it. Lights, strobes,
disco balls and high tech 4D-flash-
ing-sweeping-multicoloured-spin-
ning-lasers galore (yep, they exist
sometimes) darting around the
room also contributed to the atmos-
phere, making for a set far better
than the last time I saw him live,
where he was just standing behind
a table playing tracks and looking
very French. The set lasted an hour
and he mixed all his best tracks
together including my favourites
La Rock 01 and My Friend Dario,
as well as a few others from the
likes of Justice and The Gossip. He
seems to be one of the only people
I’ve seen that can play 4 different
tracks of this kind simultaneously
and not make it sound completely
terrible.
I’m pretty sure Vitalic was the
last act we witnessed completely,
although I do believe we went to
listen to 2ManyDJs doing their
thing in Room One for a while and
they were awesome as expected.
A sweet selection of electro mixed
with some classic non electronic
stuffcombinedwiththeirhighspeed
DJing style made for an extremely
varied set (listen to their album As
Heard On Radio Soulwax Pt.2 and
you’ll see).
All in all, this night at Fabric was
the best I’ve ever had, a million
times better than Radio Soulwax at
Canvas, which was just pure hell,
and probably better than any club
night of this type I’ve ever been to.
For sure the best night out I’ve had
this year. Next time those Belgian
dudes decide to take over Fabric
I strongly suggest you go check it
out. A final word of advice: arrive
early or you will be disappointed!
