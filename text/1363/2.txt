Floating in money
“A company wishing to issue shares
for the first time must do so in an
Initial Public Offering or IPO. This is
the act of floating, and makes pri-
vately owned companies into pub-
licly owned companies.”

BioBricking it
“Within a few short weeks, the
team had decided that they would
attempt to build the world’s first
molecular oscillator. Even to have
reached such a decision so quickly
was impressive.”

Switch everything off
“Turning your thermostat down
by 1ºC could cut your heating bills
by up to 10 per cent and save you
around £40 per year.”

Cracking bangers
“And, as you might expect, this
professor of kitchen science has
his own laboratory with all kinds of
experimental apparatus that would
not be amiss in the typical univer-
sity chemistry department.”

Fabricated highlight
“All in all, this night at Fabric was
the best I’ve ever had, a million
times better than Radio Soulwax at
Canvas, which was just pure hell,
and probably better than any club
night of this type I’ve ever been
to.”

rest of the bloody newspaper.”

Tanaka snubs Union
The Tanaka Business School have
been obstructive in a number of
the Union’s activities in the past
month.
In recent weeks, Deputy Presi-
dent (Graduate Students), Shama
Rahman, has been looking into lo-
cating available space within the
College to procure for the long-
promised postgraduate common
room. It is understood that Miss
Rahman approached the Business
School to see if she could gain ac-
cess to the Tanaka cafe for more
than just those students studying
within the Tanaka Building. Miss
Rahman’s request was politely
denied by the Tanaka authorities,
leaving the cafe exclusive to the
students that study there.
The Business School has also
managed to irritate the Union in
a number of other ways recently.
A number of “clubs” have been
formed, under the umbrella name
“Tanaka Industry Clubs” (TIC).
These include the recently-founded
Imperial College Entrepreneurs,
and the older Imperial Entrepre-
neurs. Both of these clubs had tried
to get space at Freshers’ Fair, but
were denied as they were not Un-
ion-affiliated clubs.
Of the club members that this re-
porter has spoken to, many of them
were unaware of the benefits being
a Union-affiliated club provides,
such as financial help, training in
running clubs, and the backup of
the Union should anything go awry.
Some members said that the Busi-
ness School was actively encourag-
ing clubs to work with Tanaka, and
not with the Union - one member
even went as far as to say that he’d
been told the Union was “crap”.
The establishment of clubs by
College bodies is somewhat of a
grey area. The Union’s consitution
says that the Union shall exist, and
it shall be responsible for the run-
ning of clubs. It does not, however,
say that the Union shall be the ex-
clusive organiser or authority for
clubs. Eric Lai, Deputy President
Attempts to work with the Business School have ended in failure
(Clubs & Societies), has spoken to
the Business School regarding this
matter, though no clear decision
has been reached.
Last year, Felix was prevented
from being distributed in the Tana-
ka cafe. The bin that the newspaper
normally resides in was removed,
and attempts to re-establish distri-
bution in the building have failed.
The Business School’s patron is
himself no stranger to controversy;
Gary Tanaka was arrested in July
2005 on charges of defrauding a
former client of £5m, which he alleg-
edly used for various philanthropic
purposes.
A winner is Felix
Felix scooped the top two prizes
at the Guardian Student Media
Awards 2006, held in Old Street on
Wednesday.
The newspaper had been nomi-
nated in the Best Student News-
paper category, and I Science, the
companion science magazine, had
been nominated in the Best Student
Magazine category. Rupert Neate,
last year’s Felix editor, and Chris
Miles, last year’s news editor, were
both nominated in the Best Student
Journalist category, and Mr Neate
was also nominated for Best Travel
Writer.
On Wednesday’s awards cer-
emony, Mr Neate won the overall
Journalist of the Year award and
will spend six weeks working for
the Guardian as part of the prize.
Mr Neate was also runner-up in the
Best Student Journalist category.
Felix beat other student newspa-
pers, including the favourite, Varsi-
ty (Cambridge University’s student
newspaper), to win student news-
paper of the year. The judges were
very impressed with last year’s Fe-
lix, describing it as “remorselessly
campaigning with a sense of hu-
mour and significant news values.”
I Science, Felix’s companion sci-
ence magazine, won runner-up in
the student magazine of the year
category, with Cardiff University’s
Quench winning the category.
Other notable winners from
around the city included UCL
’s
Cheesegrater, which won Best
Small Budget Publication. Chee-
segrater has often been praised as
being a fearless exposer of idiocy in
UCL
’s management, as opposed to
the rather toothless Pi. Goldsmiths
College’s newspaper, Smiths, won
student publication design of the
year.
Rupert Neate, when contacted
by Felix, said: “I couldn’t be more
pleased, it’s fantastic. I’d like to
thank everyone who worked for Fe-
lix last year; it is an award for all of
us. Together with I Science we have
proved that scientists can write. I’d
also like to thank College for giving
us so much to write about.”
Andy Sykes, current Felix editor,
commented: “I think those of us
that worked with Rupert knew that
he would go far in the world of jour-
nalism. His courage and tenacity
in constantly questioning both the
Union and the College authorities
marked him out as the most politi-
cally active editor in years.”

Hustings is a farce once again
The NUS hustings held on Tues-
day at the Charing Cross campus
was cancelled part way through
the proceedings due to a lack of
attendance.
After more than an hour of nerv-
ous whistling and foot tapping wait-
ing for the audience to arrive, the
hustings was called off. The two
teams were scheduled to argue
their points of view regarding the
current college hot topic, but in-
stead decided to prop up the bar,
alongside the students who were
enjoying an evening drink.
The hustings, held in the Reynolds
Bar, was unfortunately scheduled
just before a comedy night, mean-
ing attendence was even poorer
than it would usually be.
Hustings have a long tradition of
being seen as a waste of time by
most of the student body. The hus-
tings for the Council elections in
the JCR drew ire from those quietly
lunching there, with only the RON
campaigner, Stephen Brown, man-
aging to gain the attention of the
crowd.
Hustings to the RCC clubs was
also farcical, with candidates shout-
ing over people and a general loss
of order.
