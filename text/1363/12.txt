NUS VP Education Wes Streeting explains the NUS opposition to variable fees
T
he introduction of ‘top-
up’ tuition fees this year
has tripled the cost of
Higher Education for
thousands of students
and will see the class of ’06 graduat-
ing with debts in excess of £30,000.
This is just the thin end of the
wedge of a project of marketisation
that seeks to pass the cost of edu-
cation onto individual students and
their families. Already, some vice-
chancellors and rectors, including
Imperial’s very own Richard Sykes,
are lobbying for this cap to be raised
– or even lifted altogether.
This term, NUS mobilised over
10,000 students from across the
UK for a national demonstration
and rally in central London. This
is not the centre-piece of our battle
to prevent the lifting of the cap, it
is merely the beginning. Over the
next three years we will be building
the research, evidence and argu-
ments we will need to win, build-
ing in our campaigning action with
a focussed, strategic and targeted
lobbying campaign that will see
the inboxes and mailboxes of every
Peer and Member of Parliament
full in the run up to the crucial par-
liamentary vote in 2009.
Imperial students need to be
clear: a full market in Higher
Education will damage access to
Imperial College more than most
places. Your rector has already
made it clear that he will charge as
much as he can to generate more
income. NUS argues that Imperial
needs additional funding to remain
a world class scientific institution;
NUS does not argue with variable
funding for institutions, but we do
oppose variable fees for students.
There are other challenges fac-
ing the education sector. Over the
next two years I will be sitting on
the Universities UK delivery part-
nership steering group, bringing
together stakeholders from across
the education sector, to fundamen-
tally reform and reshape the High-
er Education admissions system.
Just another national body NUS
attends; but with it, the chance to
implement a post-qualification ap-
plication system that will radically
level the playing field to ensure
that every applicant to university is
treated fairly.
We have also been playing a lead-
ing role in the reform of the de-
gree classification system, quality
assurance mechanisms and have
board seats on the Quality Assur-
ance Agency, Higher Education
Academy and the Office of the In-
dependent Adjudicator.
All of this work nationally, has a
direct impact on students locally.
Only by being members of NUS can
you shape it.
Some in this referendum cam-
paign will argue that ICU doesn’t
need NUS, that its parent body is
prestigious enough to guarantee
F
rom the very first day at
University I was disap-
pointed. Not because I
had joined a University
renowned for its poor
male: female ratio and its fake
ethos of “Work hard, work harder”
but for the fact that we were not
part of the NUS.
At the time I did not know of the
history behind IC’s link with the
NUS or realised it was something
we had to pay to join. For me and
my post sixth form mind, NUS
meant one thing and one thing
only…discounts!
I believe that it is this very point
that our students, especially our
new freshers, associate the NUS
to. For many years I have felt
the bitter rejection of my Impe-
rial College swipe card at the tills
and the situation is only getting
worse! Only last week at Subway
sandwiches, the very staple diet
of many a student, began to en-
force discounted prices on those
bearing the NUS card only. How
dare they prevent me from enjoy-
ing a toasted BMT at a cut price!
Yet, if we are not members of the
club we cannot reap the benefits.
Yes, HMV and Virgin have begun
to tackle this problem by creat-
ing their own student cards but
I would rather carry one single
card than a card for every single
store I go to.
I hate to think of the amount we
could have saved throughout our
student lifetime, if we had access
to the card sooner? This fact is
now becoming more important for
our new cohort of students as they
pay tuition fees currently at near-
ly four times the amount set a few
years ago. Imagine the situation
for medical students or those con-
tinuing with their studies…over
five years of financial pain.
The card is just one aspect of
the NUS, what about their repre-
sentation? Let me now refer to
Tom Page’s article in Felix on the
3rd of November. His experience
at the National NUS conferences
paints the organisation as farce
with members there for their own
political gains. This maybe true,
but surely with a force such as
Imperial College attending these
conferences as well as a new look
NUS system in place, things can
only get better.
I strongly believe that Imperial
needs to be part of a support net-
work and cannot afford to stand
alone after we leave ULU. The
NUS will also aid our relationship
with the British Medical Associa-
tion (BMA), as the NUS provides
strong representation for medical
students within the BMA. Last
year it seemed that the BMA were
not supporting London medical
schools in the recent job applica-
tion scheme. More direct links
to the organisation will create a
stronger voice for Imperial and
London at a national level.
Yes the NUS will cost, but it costs
less than ULU which we’re leav-
ing and frankly we get more for
our money. The NUS has its faults
like any organisation but Imperial
being part of the group will only
strengthen it and more impor-
tantly, strengthen us. So vote for
representation, vote for savings
and vote for a stronger Imperial!
Vote Yes on November 14th.

“Imperial

be clear: a full
market in Higher
Education will
damage access
to Imperial
College more
than most
places”
No marketisation, says NUS
that the voice of Imperial’s students
will be heard anyway. As a former
president of Cambridge University
Students’ Union I can tell you from
experience that from the press
(where it matters less), to the edu-
cation sector and government de-
cision makers (where it matters
more), NUS is the only body with
the collective clout to make a differ-
ence and affect policy change. NUS
is the only show in town.
Some in this referendum cam-
paign will argue that ICU doesn’t
need NUS, that its membership
of the Aldwych Group (students’
unions of the Russell Group) can
guarantee you a national voice
without the need for NUS affilia-
tion. As a former chair of the Ald-
wych Group I can tell you from ex-
perience that as a body for bringing
similar students’ unions together
to share common experiences it’s
a useful forum, but in the media
and within the education sector, it
barely makes an impact. NUS is
the only body with representation
in the right places to make a differ-
ence and affect policy change. NUS
is the only show in town.
In the faces of the challenges
ahead, you need a strong national
campaigning voice to represent
you on the issues that matter. We
want you to play your part at the
forefront of the largest student
movement in the world. Vote YES
to the NUS.
I
’ll get my own personal opin-
ion on the referendum off my
chest first. I urge you all to go
out and vote NO! next week.
I think that affiliating would
be a huge mistake and a poor use
of the limited resourses we have.
What both sides of this debate seem
to agree on is that the NUS needs
reform. The only quibbling seems
to be over our ability to drive this
change. The starry-eyed Yes! camp
seem to think that the addition of
12,000 of us will result in massive
changes. Naturally, my colleagues
and I from The A-NUS Coalition are
somewhat more sceptical about the
influence that Imperial will have in
such an inefficient monolith.
However, no-one has said what
they mean by reform. I have a fun-
ny feeling that some might class it
as renaming the influential Labour
Students faction as “New” Labour
Students. The more I have studied
the NUS the more horrified I have
become with how useless an organ-
isation it is in its current form but
I do recognise that it has potential.
Who wouldn’t want a strong nation-
al student body that was effective in
representing us? I don’t want you to
think that A-NUS are pessimistic,
so im going to lay out my main con-
cerns with the NUS and what could
be done to address them.
The main problem with the NUS
is that it is dominated by factional
interests. This is what happens
when you put a load of people who
are politically inclined in one room.
They seem to feel the need to gang
up along religious or party political
lines (you get the odd independent,
but they always have to attract sup-
port from one of the large groups,
the so-called “Independent” Presi-
dent only won because of the sup-
port she secured from Labour
Students). In the age of online vot-
ing, why do we need to have NUS
Officers elected by only those who
attend conference? To me, the NUS
method will only result in officers
and policies even further alienated
from the people they purport to rep-
resent. Why not open voting on sen-
ior officers to all students? Surely
this is far more democratic than
letting a handful of self-interested
politicians pick “their” person?
Now that we don’t have lackeys
propped up by some incredibly fash-
ionable left-wing pressure group in
charge we can consider problem
number two The NUS represents
far too large a cross section of stu-
dents. Most affiliates are sixth-form
or FE colleges. Do they not get pis-
sed off with them banging on about
top-up fees all the time? I, some-
what flippantly, asked a member of
the Yes! campaign what exactly Im-
perial College had in common with
a lot of the other NUS members, his
reply was “we are all exempt from
council tax” (one of the historical
achievements of the NUS, sad thing
is they have done so little since they
are still parading it as an example
of a triumph). Whilst he is spot on,
this is hardly a massive overlap.
Perhaps he could have followed up
with “oh, and we all use pens and
pencils?” The current grouping is
just too large for it to be an effec-
tive lobbying group for us. The NUS
must spit into independent HE and
FE bodies.
Another elephant in the room
is that the NUS has not come to
terms with devolution in the UK.
As a proud Scotsman it pains me
to say that it needs to tell the Scots
to go home. There is no more need
for delegates from Scottish unions
to attend National Conference than
there is for delegates from a for-
eign country now that education
policy is now the responsibility of
the parliament in Edinburgh. A stu-
dent in London needs to speak to
Westminster, a student in Glasgow
does not. End of story. I suspect the
only reason that my countryman
are allowed to stay is because sen-
ior NUS officers love to grandstand
to students in disaffiliation referen-
dums that they “represent 5 million
students.” This is just another ex-
ample of the NUS being more about
political ego-stroking than ordinary
students. As a staunch (British)
unionist it is funny saying this but
NUS Scotland should break away
completely.
Now the creative destruction of
the NUS is complete. We have 4
separate bodies, two north of the
border with these parts enjoying far
greater influence than the whole.
The NUS will only be effective if it
has the respect of students and po-
liticans. At the moment I suspect
that both groups consider it to be
a laughing stock. So vote NO! and
send them homewards to think
again. If they grow up I might con-
sider voting Yes in the future, but
only if the new HE-England NUS
dosen’t have the cheek to charge for
use of its discount card. Vote NO!
Self-destruct, then we’ll join the NUS
“If they grow up
I might consider
voting Yes in the
future, but only
if the new HE-
England NUS
doesn’t have the
cheek to charge
for use of its
discount card”
Vote Yes to
NUS, says
