In response to dozens of requests
(and because the Guardian already
do it so it must be a good idea),
next week will see the introduction
of a column on how to solve cryptic
crosswords. So if there are any of
this week’s clues that you would
like explained in it, don’t hesitate to
email your requests.
Since the weather has taken
a turn for the worse, it seemed
reasonable to have a wintry theme,
much as I don’t care for themed
crosswords.
I do hope it’s not too easy, as
some people complained last time.
No-one’s ever happy.

Aquarius (20 Jan – 18 Feb)
Shhh! Quiet, we must
be silent. I don’t think
they’ve noticed me.
Fuck, I’m sexy. I think
it’s because of my
fort. Man, do girls dig
my massive widescreen displays.
Three girls in sight. I’m gunna
target them, hunt them down and
rape their ears. They want it. Hard.
Capricorn (22 Dec – 19 Jan)
Oh yeah, check m’
flow. When I get on
this mic I just spit all
in one go. You muth-
afucker’s dead hittin’
on my bitch. With my
finger on the trigger, it’s starting to
itch. This bullets got your name of
it. BLAM, now you’re in the muth-
afuckin’ shit! BLET! BLET!
Sagittarius (22 Nov – 21 Dec)
Unfortunately for you,
nothing grows at all.
A night of pranks sees
you primarily on the
receiving end (ma-
tron!). Everything in-
cluding the fine downy hair on your
feet is shaved and never regrows.
You’re so limp your fuckbuddy
hangs you from the balcony.
Scorpio (23 Oct – 21 Nov)
This week you grow
back pains. Literally.
An aura of hurt pro-
trudes from the rear
of your ribcage and
whenever you brush
past somebody in the corridor, you
assume a posture akin to a howl-
ing warewolf, before raking your
fingernails down their face.
This Week’s Stethoscopes
Gemini (22 May – 21 Jun)
HOLY FUCKZORS!
I’ve literally written
six of these prophetic
paragraphs and only
just noticed the above!
Damn! I just kekked
in me Calvin Kleins and it’s run-
ning down my third leg. I bid thee
all; we must flee the omnipresence
of The Bearded Intruder! Run!
Taurus (21 Apr – 21 May)
Dear The Horoscope,
I was “amused” to see
the alterations you
made to my hilarious
witticisms last week.
Consequently, I will
destroy you and everything you
hold dear. Never fuck with me
again. Lots of love,
The Bearded Intruder.
Aries (21 Mar – 20 Apr)
Well, whadda-ya-
know. Move over
Planet Earth, look at
this incredible bird’s
eye (damn, that fits
perfectly and I haven’t
even finished the sentence yet
- “bird’s”, geddit? Screw you then.)
shot of a fine pair of TITTIES.
Cleavage! Tit wank! Muffs!
Pisces (19 Feb – 20 Mar)
This week, you get
lucky. Amongst all the
negativity of this page,
some cunt has to get
lucky, surely? You
win some World Cup
tickets and everyone thinks you’re
cool. You sell the tickets for a mas-
sive fucking television. Everyone
thinks you’re a gargantuan prick!
Libra (23 Sept – Oct 22)
Alice’s friends: you’re
all thick. Supposedly,
you can’t read and you
wear broken glasses
that aren’t just taped,
they’re fucking gaffer
taped. Please, fuck off down a hole
where the pungent aroma of don-
keys’ genitals that emits from your
mouths cannot be smelt.
Virgo (23 Aug – 22 Sept)
This week in labs a
conical flask grows
and grows and grows
and grows. By the
time it has fully grown
and grown, it engulfs
you with its spout. The triangular
shape nestling on your head has its
own ecosystem. It’s not long before
monkeys swing from branches.
Leo (23 Jul – 22 Aug)
ROFLCOPTERS.
LOLLERSKATES.
Err... Not so “roflcop-
ters”. I’ve just noticed
a collection of pubes
lingering in the air just
above the desk! What the fuck?!
It’s not like this is a sperm bank
and people are constantly whip-
ping their todgers out. Jeez Louise.
