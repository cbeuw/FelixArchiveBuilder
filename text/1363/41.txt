King’s dethroned on their own soil
With the season starting to shape
up having come off the back of two
convincing wins, it was in Berry-
frikkin-far-lands, to face King’s 6ths
that Mooknellay’s entourage would
discover the impact our celebrity
status would have on the division,
and perhaps answer the eternal
question “Where the fuck are we?”
The game started crisply as
King’s were eager to impose their
authority. To be fair, it was KCL
who were quicker to close down in
midfield and were prepared to be
more physical in their approach,
getting so tight on occasions there
was barely a layer of latex separat-
ing any two players. This effectively
limited our opportunities with the
nearest coming via a measured ball
from a corner which Jo headed just
wide of the upright. Much of the
play revolved around our defense
with goalkeeper Mike Pursey and
defenders Jo, Ricky, Peter and Tony
showing discipline and resolve to
nullify the mounting pressure.
The game eventually descended
into a bit of a scrap with the only
highlight of the first half being the
arrival of a cat pouncing from the
shrubs by the end of the pitch to
savagely maul a bird. With the de-
sire to redeem a disappointing 45
minutes we took this as an omen
of things to come for we too have
been known to prey on fine birds
and we too are familiar with pus-
sies concealed within dense bush
(with the exception of Fuge, whose
antics last Christmas revealed he
prefers to be ridden by a Brazilian),
and we too belong at the top of the
food chain with the small exception
of the referee.
Whether it was down to a lack
of fitness surfacing in the opposi-
tion or the discipline and quality
within our own team I cannot say,
but such was the dramatic change
in the second half that saying it was
“a game of two halves” would be
about as big an understatement as
saying the phrase “a game of two
halves” is a cliché. Philipp “a pun is
too obvious” Mania, who managed
to cover more moss than Tampax,
began combining well with James
Platt and Andriy “Shev” Gelman,
securing midfield supremacy. Our
passing began caressing every
crevasse of the pitch as our play
possessed the appeal often seen
on Page 3 with moves guaranteed
to raise more cocks than a chicken
farmer and harden more nipples
than frostbite.
The deadlock was broken not long
after the restart when some neat at-
tacking play down the centre drew
out the keeper allowing Damien
Phelan to drive a loose ball low into
the undefended net.
The momentum began to snow-
ball as chances began appearing
thick and fast. The next opportunity
arrived in the form of a cross from
the left flank by Shev leading to a
scramble on the King’s goal line be-
fore Nam lumbered along carrying
the grace of Borat in an antiques
store to bundle the ball across the
line. Persistent moans, however,
lead to suspicions that the ball from
Shev had actually curled out of play
and that the keeper had two hands
on the ball before it was forced into
the goal.
The referee (a King’s player), un-
der heavy influence from the King’s
captain who appeared to have inte-
grated his natural log to the ref in
his search for Brownian motion,
eventually conceded to demands
and gave a goal kick.
However, our revenge was swift
when goal machine Shev was
played in to fire a first time shot
past the keeper for 2-0.
At this point King’s looked as
likely to score as a non-6ths player
with the line “Girl, you must have
yeast, because I’ve got a fire in my
pants and it’s definitely giving rise
to something!” With King’s show-
ing about as much endurance as a
Beckham haircut, it wasn’t long be-
fore a short corner worked its way
to the late arriving Philipp, to pull
off a Zidane turn before produc-
ing a Lampard-esque chip from an
impossible angle which clipped the
underside of the bar and fell behind
the line for 3-0.
King’s were given respite when
Platt’s manoeuvre towards the
ball, which can only be described
as ‘beat the gypsy’, induced cries
of handball resulting in a penalty.
Unfortunately for King’s, Pursey
managed to produce an outstand-
ing save to deny their captain any
consolation and hold out for our
third successive clean sheet.
Shev was once again at the helm of
our most prominent attacks when a
neatly dinked ball in his direction al-
lowed him to gently lift the ball over
the on rushing keeper capping off a
move which would have Kazakhsta-
nis across the land exclaiming Wah
Wah Wee Wah! To conclude the goal
rout, Hamish delivered a cleverly
weighted through ball to the feet of
Andriy who calmly slotted the ball
around the advancing keeper, com-
pleting a hat-trick so fine, a 10 Giga-
pixel camera would’ve had trouble
maintaining focus. Several further
opportunities came our way with
Damien hitting the bar on one oc-
casion, meaning the 5-0 score line
was more a compliment to their de-
fensive efforts.
The game ended abruptly when
Hamish’s challenge for the ball was
met with another contesting fore-

head, which despite his eagerness
to give head, lead to the Mook being
escorted from the pitch suffering a
bruised brow. Taking further mean-
ing from the cat incident, our minds
began scrolling through the pages
of To Kill A Mocking Bird, prompt-
ing us to offer a sympathetic hand-
shake and words of understanding
whilst bearing no hidden agendas
towards the generous post match
plate of sandwiches we gratuitously
woofed down.
To summarize, our general abil-
ity to endure 45 minutes of foreplay
and go on to last the full 90, plus
our intricate knowledge of 11 differ-
ent positions, means satisfaction is
rarely denied, on and off the playing
field.
