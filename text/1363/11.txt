Tumelty: “I’d like to speak for you”
Gemma Tumelty is the NUS National President and the first from a post-1992 university. She was previously a
sabbatical officer at Liverpool John Moores University and graduated with a BSc (Hons) in Applied Psychology
I
’ve been president of NUS
since July 2006, and already
since then, I’ve spoken as
the voice of students over 100
times. I’ve got the right to
speak on behalf of UK students be-
cause I lead the National Union of
Students UK, a democratic organi-
sation where policy is decided at
our Annual Conference, the larg-
est democratic conference of it’s
kind. The NUS President speaks
on behalf of the largest democratic
student movement in the world.
I’ve spoken to Ministers, to Gov-
ernment officials and to numerous
broadcast and print media. When
I’m asked to speak, what I say re-
flects and represents the ‘voice of
UK students’, the sad thing is, when
I’m thinking of what to say, I never
think about Imperial’s words, what
Imperial students want, what Im-
perial students need. I’ve no way
to hear your voice, you don’t talk to
me, you are not my member. You
can change that, you can speak to
me, so that I can speak for you….
How? Just vote yes to NUS.
I want to say how much I am
looking forward to the upcoming
affiliation referendum at Imperial.
It will give this generation of Im-
perial students a chance missed
by the generations before – to sign
both themselves and their union
up to the wide range of benefits
that NUS offers. It has been 5 years
since students at Imperial last had
the chance to decide on their mem-
bership to the National Union, and
a lot has changed in those 5 years,
both in the education sector, but
more importantly inside NUS.
The last few years in NUS have
been spent making the work of the
National Union more relevant to
the needs of our members (stu-
dents’ unions) and our member’s
member’s (students) – just like
you. NUS is widely recognised
as the leading educational pres-
sure group representing students
throughout the UK.
We talk weekly to the government
on behalf of students, we talk daily
to the media on behalf of students,
and we talk hourly to a wide range
of national bodies and organisa-
tions such as Universities UK on
behalf of students. We are the rec-
ognised national voice of students
across the UK, and right now, not
only are Imperial College Union
not part of that national voice, the
concerns and views of Imperial
Students are not considered. This
is your chance to change that!
NUS campaigns and represents
on all issues that affect students
as students, but we also do much
much more. I recommend that
those of you who want to know
more look at our two websites
www.officeronline.co.uk and www.
nusonline.co.uk. Here are the
highlights:
We campaign
• We carry our campaign work on
a variety of student issues includ-
ing fairer funding systems, better
student housing and healthcare.
• We have active liberations cam-
paigns: LGBT, Black Students’,
Womens and Students’ with
Disabilities.
• We provide official representa-
tion to government and national
bodies.
• NUS representatives sit on gov-
ernmental committees and provide
evidence which is used to shape
policies and inform legislation.
• We produce research on student
issues for publication, to raise pub-
lic awareness of issues affecting
students today.
We strengthen local union
activity
• We have a Development Projects
Unit, allowing your student ac-
tivities to benefit from training, to
network and share ideas through
Stadia.
• We provide research and infor-
mation, support and advice for
your union officers on virtually any
area of education and student life,
from housing to franchise courses,
student funding to women’s issues.
There are also special projects on
accommodation costs and student
health.
We Make Commercial Sense
• We produce the NUS Extra card,
which gives students a range of
high street discounts from cloth-
ing to music and computers. The
Extra card will bring in an addi-
tional £1,000,000 to students’ un-
ions across the country, with 40 per
cent of the profits of the Extra card
being channelled directly back into
local students unions to be spent
as each local union deems best.
The list goes on…. but I’ll leave
it there. I believe that students at
Imperial will benefit enormously
from joining with hundreds of oth-
er unions to campaign for those
things that affect us all. As we set
up and develop the London Stu-
dent Assembly to ensure the voice
of London students is articulated
directly to the GLA, as we con-
tinue to meet with TfL to enhance
and sharpen the discount package
for London students and as we
continue to lobby locally and na-
tionally on behalf of students, I’d
be delighted to be able to speak out
for you too. Not only that, but as
NUS President I know more than
anyone, that my organisation can
never reach its full potential un-
til we can truly claim to speak for
every student, in every college and
university. I hope you will use your
vote in this referendum to bring
that vision closer to reality.
I
wrote in Felix recently about
my concerns with NUS, and
my belief that come the ref-
erendum the vote should be
NO! Firstly, it would be ter-
ribly arrogant of me to assume to
know much about Imperial Col-
lege Union at all – I have been
here for all of six weeks and in that
time have had little opportunity to
delve into ICU. So, you might ask,
how can I have to audacity to state
I know what’s best for the union
regarding NUS?
The answer to this is simple
– I have plenty of NUS experience,
and spent a year as the sabbatical
president of Durham Students’
Union (DSU). It is NUS that is
broken, not Imperial. However,
I would not recommend mouldy
food, a derelict property, the music
of James Blunt or NUS to anyone,
simply because all of these things
are a detrimental item to acquire
regardless of your current status.
One of the concerns raised has
been that we would have no rep-
resentation should we not join.
This argument doesn’t hold wa-
ter for two reasons. Firstly, it is
indeed possible to have a voice as
a single union. While the Higher
Education Act 2004 was being dis-
cussed Durham got several BBC
interviews, including national
news at six, they interviewed us
in our Union, we got spots on lo-
cal radio and they did a follow up
peace on TV with us after the bill
was enacted.
It’s worth emphasising that we
were just one union – all of this
was arranged without NUS. It’s
also interesting to see people
describe Imperial students as
apathetical as several have done
to me – exactly the same charge
was constantly laid on Durham
students. We can still have a voice
– all it takes is work from the ICU
sabbs, and I see no evidence that
they are not capable of this.
We need not work on our own
– there are many unions who I’m
sure would be happy to work with
us on targeted campaigns. We are,
of course, still able to work with
our friends at other colleges in
London on relevant issues – good
unions will work with other unions
because they agree on a key prin-
cipal, not because they happen to
be a member of NUS.
When the topic of our voice on
the national arena is raised we
also need to look at a second point
– is NUS the voice we want? Last
time I wrote I talked about the
dysfunction of NUS’ annual Na-
tional Conference (NC). I don’t
want to pretend there is nothing
more to NUS, but it’s critical to
realise that NUS policy is decid-
ed by NC, and effectively by NC
alone. The regional conferences
(of which there are three a year)
are a better opportunity to talk
to NUS exec members (known as
the NEC), but they have no policy-
setting power. This means that
NUS principles for the year are
decided by the farce of National
Conference.
It is for this reason that the only
line NUS will take on the student
funding issue is that of no-fees and
full grants. When I attended one of
the Mass Lobbies of Parliament I
was inside Parliament, speaking
to MPs and trying to convince
them that the bill on the table was
broken and needed fixing. Some
on the NEC were helping, but oth-
ers seemed much more interest-
ing in protesting outside. When
one of the NEC sat down in the
road outside Parliament and in-
so-doing infuriated the (otherwise
highly supportive) members of the
public it made me want to cry.
The atmosphere of NUS con-
ference means that one of two
motions get passed – the so-obvi-
ous-it-hurts motion, e.g. “To work
positively to improve the student
experience in halls of residence”,
something you’d hope NUS would
do even if they had no policy on
it, or the rousing rhetoric “Con-
tinue campaigning for…grants
covering living cost [&] an end to
all methods of charging for their
education”
Neither of these two types of mo-
tion are terribly helpful. One does
what they’d do anyway, and the
other is understandably popular,
but avoids having a proper debate
about what we will and what we
won’t accept as a funding proposal
for students. One cannot usefully
engage with politicians or other
opinion-formers without a well
thought out policy. While at Dur-
ham NUS were great at providing
me with placards and posters, but
very poor at providing me with an-
ything to actively engage with the
decision makers.
One of the biggest troubles with
NUS is that the constituent unions
are all so different – a Further Ed-
ucation union receiving next-to-
no money and with no facilities is
in an entirely different world from
a large HE union. They will often
have very different policy views,
which is partly why when NUS
make policy it’s so bland or popu-
list – it’s about the only way you
can get an agreement.
I don’t think this is a voice that
will actively speak for Imperial.
We shouldn’t join NUS because
there’s nothing better of compara-
ble scale. It’s a terrible reason; one
that is logically deficient. However
much we might desire it, we can-
not fix NUS by joining it. We can,
however, spend the £50k+ a year
on projects in welfare, campaign-
ing and facilities and get the very
best for students at Imperial.

NUS”
