This week sees the release of Crea-
tive Assembly’s latest swords-and-
sieges-and-squalor opus, Medieval
2: Total War. For someone like me,
who has lost entire weekends to its
predecessors (and I still think of the
Pope as someone to assassinate
rather than the leader of one of the
world’s most influential religions),
this is one of the events of the year,
and I’ll probably spend half of the
coming month believing fervently
that I am the King of England. De-
spite being Scottish. Part of this is
down to the fact that the Total War
games have the immersive quali-
ties of an Olympic swimming pool,
surrounding you with period detail
that nonetheless retains a humor-
ous touch. The rest is down to the
Total War games being so much fun
to play, and unique at that.
Creative Assembly’s mastery of
the empire-building-and-battling
genre is so complete that it could
be called a monopoly. For many
companies, this would be an invita-
tion for them to rest on their Rome:
Total War branded laurels, but CA
soldier on with improvements and
perfections to their existing formu-
la. Granted, Medieval 2 will not be
the quantum leap that Rome was,
but even at the shallowest level,
M2:TW is a different beast. Graphi-
cally stunning, you could almost
believe that you were actually wit-
nessing medieval battles if it wasn’t
for the whole ‘floating in the sky
Chivalry, shanks and shoulder pads

for good measure – and to me, this
just isn’t good enough. It has both
tank rushes and shoulder pads!
Could it be any less appealing?
Similarly, other strategy games
are failing to push the envelope in
many ways. Some developers try
to nose ahead of the pack with cin-
ematic spectacle, tanks and people
swearing, some just slap together
yet another sub-Tolkien fantasy
setting and hope like mad that the
punters will buy it. Others genu-
inely try to innovate, whether it be
Supreme Commander’s modelling
of war on an unprecedented, epic
scale (albeit with a disappointingly
generic sci-fi coating) or the Total
War games’ marriage of real-time
in-depth tactics and ruling the mi-
nutiae of a country.
Whether the strategy genre can
evolve and keep us interested re-
mains to be seen. All I know is that
for the coming month, you can steer
clear unless you’re willing to call
me ‘sire’ and send me emissaries
detailing the level of public order
in Rouen. The rest of you peasants
can go hang.
with a mouse cursor’ thing; leaving
eye candy aside, the game is imple-
menting such things as religion and
trade in a more complex (yet acces-
sible) way than ever before. But
even the most ardent fanboy would
be hard pressed to claim that these
are monumental advances. No-one
is going to wax lyrical about being
able to rig Papal elections in the
same way that they did when Sho-
gun: Total War first introduced us
to the wonders of tactical battling
on a grand scale, or when Com-
mand & Conquer let us loose on
the tank rush (which was actually
fashionable once upon a time, a bit
like shoulder pads and the British
Empire). Is the strategy genre as a
whole losing its progressive edge?
Command & Conquer is a good
example. Back in ’97, when men
were men and I was still in prima-
ry school, I loved the C&C games.
Dearly. Whether detailing strange
cartoony sci-fi terrorism or strange
cartoony sci-fi Soviets, I couldn’t get
enough of them. But with the an-
nouncement of the so-called ‘third’
in the series, I find that my anticipa-
tion has upped sticks and moved to
the Cotswolds for its retirement. No
matter what I read of C&C 3, I can’t
get excited about it. Mention this to
people and they treat me like I’m
some mad heretic. It’s a game that
seems to be riding entirely on the
success of its predecessors with a
bit more bump-mapping thrown in
Total War, yesterday. Not pictured - our intrepid writer, cackling
Art imitates life, as they say. A cen-
tury ago, the idea of rushing two
large bodies of men towards each
other was still thought of as a pret-
ty neat idea, and easily the most
intelligent way to fight a war. Now,
the missiles we’re firing at enemy
nations are only marginally less
intelligent than the ones pressing
the big red button to launch it. And
for gaming, too, the war genre has
evolved a lot in its short life.
If you’re reading this, chances are
the only wars you’ve lived through
were either cold, or at best luke-
warm. War isn’t something we
instinctively relate with the real
world very much. But it’s also like-
ly – if you’ve been gaming for any
length of time – that you’ll have
played Command And Conquer :
Red Alert. Of course, humourously
leather-bound Soviets and
slightly over-enthusiastic
female commandos are
a slightly skewed
portrayal of war-
fare. But Red
Alert wasn’t ex-
actly alone in
painting a surreal
view of fictional
– and non-fictional
– warfare.
Cannon Fodder
– War Has Never Been So Much
Fun! – in terms of setting the sty-
listic tone for a game, you can’t get
much better than that. Cannon Fod-
der is generally recognised as being
ahead of its time in that regard, as
well as few other fields, such as its
relationship with the press. “Make
sure you do not buy this shameful
game” was the Daily Star’s reac-
tion to the game, after the British
Legion complained it had used the
Corn Poppy on the game box. May-
be this wouldn’t have been so con-
tentious a move if the game itself
hadn’t largely based itself around
making a joke of war and modern
warfare in general. Between that
and Wolfenstein 3D’s historically-
ambiguous Robo-Hitler (I’m told
that the jury is still out as to wheth-
er or not Adolf was in possession of
a mecha-suit), it’s a wonder any-
one took anything seriously
in the early nineties.
But it wasn’t all gram-
matically-incorrect
German and cute
soldiers bleeding to
death. When Platoon
was released in the
late eighties, only a
decade after the Viet-
nam War had come to
a close, the game that
followed shortly after attempted to
bring some of the feel of the film
to gaming too. Hard though it was
to convey political opinion with a
palette of 16 colours and just about
enough memory to remember what
level the player was on, Platoon was
one of a number of war games that
didn’t suffer from the caricature
age of videogaming. There was no
need to dumb down the message,
or dilute the experience any further
than the technology already had.
And though we highlighted Can-
non Fodder earlier as being an ex-
ample of light-hearted war gaming,
that’s a highly unfair view of the
game. Cannon Fodder, despite be-
ing demonised for ‘glorifying’ war,
actually aimed to satirise the view
of war perpetrated by Vietnam and
the Gulf. Tiny pixellated recruits
queued up to be enlisted next to
a hill where hundreds of graves
marked the fates of the last crop. It
was unnervingly violent, certainly,
but never intended to mock.
It’s possible – if cynical – to say
that war gaming got stale as its
popularity grew. But whatever the
cause for change, the past is rich
with counterexamples. There was
the cartoon-like side of the death
and destruction, but there was also
a lot of seriousness, and plenty of
designers who had something to
communicate to gamers. What is it
good for? If what war games have
becomeisanythingtogoby,perhaps
very little. But both Cannon Fodder
and Wolfenstein represent a kind of
playful enthusiasm for the genre
that may have been lost in the end-
less drive for realism and grittiness.
Maybe the lesson to learn from the
past of gaming, much like the past
of war itself, is that a load of ex-
plosions doesn’t get you anywhere
useful at all. Nowadays, bombarded
with a numbing stream of cod-Pri-
vate-Ryan sanitised ‘war horror’,
we can’t help but be numbed by it.
In an age of blood and gore, maybe
we need a few robo-suits.
War - your results may vary
Either by complete coincidence,
or shrewd marketing, Call of
Duty 3 (below) is released on the
Xbox 360 just a day before Re-
membrance Day. As our feature
on the opposite page suggests, it’s
still the same old explosions and
gunfire – but by the same token,
it’s still a visceral, exciting experi-
ence that’s not to be missed. Re-
leases on other platforms follow in
the coming weeks.
If you’re finding that a little bit
too frantic, however, you may wish
to distance yourself from the ac-
tion a little with Medieval 2: Total
War, a triumphant – graphically,
if nothing else – return to familiar
territory for developers Creative
Assembly. If you’re used to charg-
ing everywhere with the biggest
unit you can find, then you’re in for
a shock. But if you’ve experienced
Total War before, you can expect
improvements on everything im-
portant. Almost.
Tony Hawks returns again
with an unusual subtitles, this
time performing some ‘Downhill
Jam’, which Felix Games is in-
formed by a reliable expert to be
‘hip’ and ‘illing’. The game itself is
a welcome change from American
Wasteland, a sequel that left a lot
to be desired in terms of playabil-
ity. Expect a Wii-exclusive version
soon, too.
Oh and – look! Some more se-
quels and expansion packs too.
It’s that comforting time of year
where people are suddenly realis-
ing that there are a mere fourty-
five days until Christmas, and
thus Novembermas is upon us,
and the add-ons must flow! They
vary from the cheap-and-cheer-
ful Sims 2 – Festive Holiday
Stuff to the not-cheap and decid-
edly-unnerving Buzz Sports. It’s
not that we’re against the idea of
turning your living room into a
Weakest Link studio. It’s just that
we’d rather the game was actually
hosted by Anne Robinson. And
that’s saying something.
Failing that, you could regress
back to the childhood spirit of the
winter playground, and pick up a
copy of Pokemon Mystery Dun-
geon and relive the days when
Blastoise could actually hold his
own, with the nerds in the yard.
