Will it all seem worthwhile
5 YEARS FROM NOW?
At Turner 4 Newall we give a considerable
amount of thought to the question of a man's
future. And our graduate training scheme is
planned to be adaptable to his individual needs
- to employ and extend his attainments fully.
You May Know Our Name But . . . just to
remind you — we are not only the dominant
asbestos group in Britain, we also have a large
and growing stake in plastics, in insulation, in
mineral wool, and in glass fibre ... all adding
up to a £100,000,000 business with some
40,000 employees. Big enough to give a man
scope. Yet, because each of our nine British
companies largely runs its own affairs/not so
big that the essential 'human touch' is
endangered.
This balance is reflected in our executive
development training which, far from tying a
man down to any one fype of career —
production, sales, administration - allows him
time to discover his true potential.
This way, we invariably find that the graduate
assumes managerial' responsibility more con-
fidently - and certainly earlier - than is usual
in a modern industrial complex.

details, or write direct to:

SEMI-FINAL
D R A W
The pairings for this Saturday's
semi-finals of the U.L. Cup were
announced last Wednesday. Both
matches are to be played on neu-
tral ground. They are:—
GUY'S HOSPITAL v. I.C. (at
L.S.E. ground)
An I.C. team boosted by the
presence of seven University
players meets a Guy's team
boosted by a similar number of
United Hospitals players, two of
whom are youth internationals.
Of the two teams, Guy's has the
most impressive cup record to
date having disposed of Northern
Poly 7-1 and U.C. 5-1, and they
are confidently tipped /n many
circles to win the cup. " Felix "
equally confidently tips the cup-
holders, I.C., however.
L.S.E. v. Q.M.C. (at Guy's
ground)
This is a duel between the top
two teams in the premier division.
The fact that Mary's call on two
University players for cup
matches while L.S.E. play their
regular team may swing the result
in Q.M.C.'s favour, but rumour
has it that their team has not been
up to scratch just lately. In order
to win they will have to get the
ball past L.S.E.'s Burnley junior
goalkeeper.

IN TIZARD ?
Yes, .it's M for (Montgolher,
Comrades with 0015 members,
and a secret rendezvous. Who is
Doctor Yesando, and what are
the motives surrounding the secret
meetings behind locked doors in
Southside.
It is Spectre, a Self Perpetuat-
ing Exclusive Cult for Reading
Epistles: their instructions to
gather at discrete intervals to dine
together, read papers and indulge
in interlectual intercourse. The
Montgolfier Club has been con-
vened by mastermind M , after a
meeting of the handpicked 15 to
discuss " a certain matter." It has
been suggested that there will be a
bond forged between the group
and a respectable Guild, but what
are the real aims? The intrigue
deepens. Are the special 15 pawns
in a giant Masterplot? Will M win
through? And what has Gold-
finger to do with Montgolfier ?
