APARTHEID RALLY
FEARUARY 28
The facts of apartheid are these;
An African who wishes to «ain
better working conditions cannot.
African trades unions are illegal,
to strike incurs penalties of up
to £500 fine and 3 years in prison.
An African who wishes to de-
cide his own living place cannot.
75 per cent of the total popula-
tion may lease land in only 13
per cent, of the territory of the re-
public he is restricted to squalid
color zones. He has no right to
bring his wife and children to live
in the town where he is working.
He must carry at all times his
pass—resigned monthly by his
employer. If a negro woman has
intercourse with a white man—
that man may get up to 7 years
hard labour.
With these facts, an action
group was established at a meeting
of the political and religous soci-
eties Chairmen, to bring the facts
of apartheid before (the Union.
Three information sheets on the
repressive laws, the boycott
and the political prisoners are
being distributed — the societies
will sponsor a film on apar-
theid. Also a Union resolution
was agreed on asking the union
to deplore apartheid, reaffirm the
refectories boycott of South Afri-
can goods, and provide for anti-
apartheid publicity space. It was
hoped to run a debate but when
Gordon Hall tried to arrange a
debate on apartheid, he failed,
because no one from the South
African Ambassador downwards
E U R O P E A N W E E K
An African may not be edu-
cated in a South African Univer-
sity—he must fight for a place
(less than 700 available in SA in
1962) in one of the three " Ethnic
Colleges." Even these Ethnic
Colleges are under the total rule
of the Department of Native
Affairs.
N O LIBERTY
An African may not enjoy
liberty even in Verwoerds Bantu-
stans — the Minister of Native
Affairs may at any time depose
any Chief or Headman, or veto
the appointment of any Council-
lor. Police may attend any oLthe
Bantu Tribal Authoritory meet-
ings whenever they please.
The responsibility of Apartheid
lies not only with South Africa.
It lies also with Britain. Over
£l,000m. is invested by British
Companies in South Africa, just
over half the total investment
there. Our trading concerns do
millions 'of pounds of profitable
trade with South Africa. In fact
it is the British shareholders who
are profiting from apartheid and
its suppression of the African
laborer
was prepared to speak for this
poMcy.
To make our protest more con-
crete we will take part in the mass
meeting to be held «by Anti Apar-
theid on Friday, 28th February,
at 7.30 p.m. in the Central Hall,
Westminster. To focus Britains
attention on this meeting students
will assemble at U L U at 6 p.m.
to rally and march to Leicester
Square in a banner bearing torch-
light procession. Regional con-
tingents and supporting demon-
strations are being organised
throughout Britain.
We appeal to all of you with a
conscience, show your abhorrence
of the Apartheid regime and its
British baokers, support the reso-
lution, sign the petition on politi-
cal prisoners, and join the rally.

A FOURTH COLLEGE A T LC.
The Architectural Association
will make a fourth College in I.C
as from August 1st 1967. Efforts
are at present being made to find
srjace to accommodate them.
Paris, always a city of fascina-
tion and interest, was the meeting
point for a " European Week "
organised by the Ecole Centrale
des Arts et Manufactures, from
December 2nd—8th.
We joined four other English
Students, two from Cambridge
and two from Birmingham, and
delegations from Germany, Bel-
gium, Holland, Switzerland and
Italy. The well arranged pro-
gramme combined visits, recep-
tions, and lectures and provided
adequate stimulus and scope for
discussion.
Several Industrial^ visits were
arranged for us including the
Nuclear Centre at Saclay and
the Basse-Seine Shell Refineries.
Later in the week we visited Orly
Airport, the Bridge at Tanker-
ville (complete with gale-force
winds )and the " S.S. France"
docked at Le Havre. We were
presented to the Lord Mayor of
Paris at a " Champagne and
Caviar" reception in the City
Hall.
A Dinner-Debate at the end of
the week proved interesting,
amusing and not without its con-
fusions due to the added diffi-
culty of expressing one's point of
view in French!
Points discussed included the
Importance of Vac. Training;
the Responsibilities of the Stu-
dent towards his Studies ; Lec-
tures and Study Methods and
Liaisons between Industry and
University. We discovered that
several of the other European
Scientific Universities have com-
pulsory courses in subjects such
as Philosophy, Classics and Lan-
guages. On the other hand, the
Midday General Studies Pro-
gramme is unique to I.C.
From discussions we learnt
that Science and Technology in
other European Countries is
more advanced than one might
be tempted to believe.
We feel that the useful experi-
ence gained could be greatly
extended if I.C. were hosts to a
similar gathering of European
Students in London.

The society started the session
with a Freshers' Evening in the
Autumn Term followed bv acti-
vities which ranged from Chinese
Chess to a '* home-cooked"
Chinese Dinner Evening in which
dishes representative of food
from Malaya, Formosa and
Hong Kong were cooked and
served to about twenty-five eager
members, all of whom devoured
the food with great relish. A
Hong Kong Evening was held in
conjunction with the Inter-
national Relations Club in which
Mr. Phillip Chen presented Hong
Kong to the enthusiastic mem-
bers. A Malaysia Evening is
pianned similarly for this term.
Chinese New Year falls on
February 13th this year, and the
Committee would like to take
this opportunity to wish all the
Chinese Members of the College
a very happy and prosperous
New Year (Kong Hee Fath
Choy !). To celebrate this festive
occasion, a Chinese New Year
Dinner has been arranged on the
evening of 12th February, and all
members wishing to attend
should not delay in contacting
any of the Committee Members.
CHESS M A T C H
A Chinese Chess Match
against Hong Kong House or
Malaya Hall is being arranged.
Those interested in participating
in this new venture are requested
to contact Mr. Yap (Elec. Eng.
3). Informal Evenings this term
will be mainly lectures (Chinese
art, culture, art of self-defence,
etc.) and films. Refreshments
are of course provided free of
charge at these meetings. Every-
one, especially non-Chinese, is
welcome.
Good News ! Another " Home-
cooked Dinner" may be forth-
coming at the end of term. Any
takers ?
