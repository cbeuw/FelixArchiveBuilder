THE STATUS OF THE
E N G I N E E R
Nearly half the undergraduates
at I.C. are engineers ; many of
them believe engineering is a
worth-while profession—'but what
does the rest of the world think ?
More important, what do school
sixth-formers think ?
Many engineers will agree that
technology is often overshadowed
by pure science. We have all
heard of " Scientists's efforts to
reach the moon"—essentially a
technological problem. Engin-
eering lacks status—and this is
reflected in the quantity and
quality of undergraduate en-
trants.
Mr. G. Jones, of Birkbeck Col-
lege, gave a lecture last term on
his survey of attitudes of sixth-
formers to engineering, unfortu-
nately to Electrical post-grad-
uates only. This lecture was
based on an article by him in
" Engineering." A conference of
teachers and industrials was held
in Oxford to discuss this very
problem last Spring. Two main
facts emerge. In spite of over-
whelming pressure for University
places, which meant that 5,000
people failed to gain admission
last year, many College's engin-
eering faculties were unfilled.
Then, the sixth-formers who gain
the highest A-level marks defi-
nitely prefer pure science to en-
gineering, and the less able pre-
fer engineering.
Two reasons seem to cause this
indifference to engineering in
sixth-formers — one educational,
the other social.
SOCIAL STANDING
At 17 or thereabouts, sixth-
formers, living in a very restricted
environment mentally and soc-
ially, must choose their careers.
Obviously, they will prefer pure
science, of which they have some
experience, to technology, of
which they have not. The mas-
ters who advise them on careers
(their parents are rarely con-
sulted)) are usually pure scientists
or arts masters with little know-
ledge of technology.
Perhaps just as important is
the social standing of engineers.
Here ignorance is shocking. One
sixth-former said " mechanical
engineering was very much a
good job and worthwhile taking
up in the early part of the cen-
tury. The scope for knowledge
of this subject is however so
limited that there can be little
stimulus for discovery and over-
coming new problems to-day."
This is an age when technology
progress has never been greater.
Another said of Civil engineering,
"To my mind, it is an employ-
ment for a local or county coun-
cil. I myself would never work
for a council."
Mr. W. D. Hutchings of the
Oxford department of Education
instigated a survey among ten per
cent of all sixth-forms, public and
state, in England and Wales. A
most revealing part of his survey
occurred when boys listed profes-
sions according to—
(a) which they thought were
highest paid,
(b) which they thought had
greatest prestige in the pub-
lic eye,
(c) which they thought required
the highest intelligence.
Of the 19 given occupations,
doctors, solicitors and nuclear
physicists came high in the " top
six" of each category, architects
and school and university
teachers came high in two cate-
gories. Engineers came nowhere.
Mechanical engineers are
thought by many to be in the
same category as factory
workers : " Blokes in boiler suits
carrying oil cans." One boy said
" I think mechanical engineering
. . . is one of the lower types of
scientific employment."

TECHNOLOGICAL H E R O
Outside school, these boys are
bombarded by film and T.V.
programmes glorifying doctors,
lawyers, scientists, policemen . . .
never engineers or technologists!
What can be done ? Obviously
at schools, careers in technology
should be much better publicised.
Perhaps even technological
courses, to supplement pure
science courses, could be given
in schools. And the social pres-
tige of engineers increased—-just
one good T.V. series or a great
novelist concentrating on a tech-
nological hero would go a lpng
way to improve the sad social
standing of engineers.
Anyone who wishes to pursue
the story of these two surveys
further will find articles in the
1st March and 13th September,
1963, issue of "Engineering"
very informative.

Islamic Week
One hears about Islam, about
Muslim countries, and about
Muslims. Many people know
Muslims make a pilgrimage to
the holy city of Mecca, and that
Muslim countries (Middle East,
North Africa, Pakistan, Malaysia,
Indonesia) are very much in the
news. But is this all that you
know about Islam? Would you
like to know more about Muslims,
to meet them and to discuss
various topics with them? Then
you should join in the Islamic
Week.
The aim of the Islamic Week is
to present various facets of Islam
and Muslims to the members of
the College, and others, and in
coffee sessions in the evenings to
meet each other and form friend-
ships. To this end various cul-
tural, religious, social, and his-
torical programmes have been
arranged. On Monday 10th Feb.
—Social Evening with the Paki-
stani Society in South Side lounge
at 7.30 p.m. Mr. Majeed will
speak on " Islam in Pakistan "
and there will be films and coffee.
On Wednesday, 12th Feb.—Cul-
tural Evening. Talk and films
about Islamic Culture at 7.30
p.m. in the S.C.R. Union.
On Thursday, 13th February,
Meeting with the Arab Society.
Talk on " Palestine — Mancroft
Affair — Jordan River" by Ed-
ward Attayh at 130 p.m. in the
Concert Hall. Also, at 7.30 p.m.
in the Union S.C.R. there will be
a discussion with the Student
Christian Movement on " Honest

functions and we hope you will
bring along your friends.

ENGINEERS BOOZE-UP
In the setting of a decor de-
signed by that brilliant interior
decorator Howard Wise, the
Engineers held their Annual
Dinner Dance. The guest speaker
was Mr. E. S. Sellors, who needs
no introduction to our Chemical
Engineers.
Some outstanding features of
the evening were the inaugural
N . Other (followed by much
presentation of the new spanner
(after much labour) and the caba-
ret by an old Centralian and A .
laughter). The ladies were im-
pressive and generally well-
dressed and altogether the atmo-
sphere belied the common fable
that all 'Engineers are .spanner
waving morons, (greeted with
much sceptism).

PHOENIX CRIT
Phoenix is often regarded as
I.C. Union's white elephant. De-
spite this, the last issue sold
surprisingly well. Congratulations
then, to the Editor for the way in
which he instilled some life into a
magazine which was feared by
many to be moribund. He has had
a difficult task on his hands, and
his enthusiastic and effective
organisation has been very evi-
dent, especially regarding the pub-
licity arrangements. However,
disappointingly little of this vigour
stems from the pages of the maga-
zine itself. The poetry is not only
" pseudo" and weak, but is
unreadable, and merits no more
than a cursory glance. The
essays and short stories are better
written but are not outstanding.
This leads one to winder if this
is really the best that IC can pro-
duce. Obviously, it is not, and it
is regrettable that so little support
if forthcoming for a cause which
deserves as much as it can get.
Perhaps the Editor's almost ob-
vious shortage of copy partly jus-
tifies his reliance on contributors
who are unconnected (with "the
College.
The Editorial itself says very
little. It was really no more than
the airing, in a vague sort of way,
of the Editor's grouse with the
Rector for censoring his original
efforts. In the circumstances we
certainly sympathise with him for
being denied the Freedom of his
" Facile pen." We are therefore
left to infer what is, in fact, the
"Fertile Fodder" to which the
Editor refers.
The layout is less startling than
it has been in the past, However,
the profusion of blank spaces was
annoying. These, surely, would
have been avoided by using
quotes etc. The use of small type
was also irritating, and further,
we consider the use of small letters
in the author's names a most
peculiar habit, to say the least.
The overall impression we
gained of " Phoenix " was that,
although it showed much promise,
there was a distinct lack of any
strong editorial policy character-
ising it. Bill McAuley, the Editor
is, we know, trying to remedy this,
and we wish him every success ior
the next issue.
