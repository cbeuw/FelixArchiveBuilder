Dear Sir,
At the beginning of last term,
the 'Ecole Centrale,' France's top
Engineering College, wrote to our
Union asking if we would send
two representatives to a " Euro-
pean Week " that they were run-
ning in December.
Miss Chapman (Zoology HI)
and myself attended this meeting.
Before going we informed the
Editor of Felix, and said that we
would write an article for him.
The article was duly written and
handed in along with two photos
in time for the first issue of Felix
this term. However it did not
appear in the first issue. I have
consulted the Editor who informs
me that there was not sufficient
room for it that week.
I maintain that this should have
taken preference over several of
the articles published in that issue.
It was an honour for our college
to be invited to a gathering of
students from the top engineering
colleges in Europe (many of the
delegates were Union Presidents)
and it shows that our college is
highly regarded in Europe.
I consider that this was one of
the most important external af-
fairs that our Union has been
involved with this year and that
it warranted a good cover in the
first possible issue of the news-
paper.
It is worth pointing out here
that no effort was made on behalf
of the paper to extract a story

Station have /recovered a large
number of stolen bicycles. These

Station on, a date to be announ-
ced. If any student has had his
cycle stolen during the past 12
months from the precincts of the
College and not reported same to
Police will he please contact the
Security Officer either personally
or telephone Internal 2741.

Four-fifths* of
top civil servants
take THE TIMES
111111:11
So only this: these particular Top People must keep them-
selves fully and widely informed. They must be aware
not only of happenings in their particular field, but of dis-
cussion and comment on questions of the day, international
news, politics and the arts. For all this, they turn- to THE TIMES.
You may not want to be a top civil servant: lots of people
don't. But the same is true of top dons, top businessmen, top
politicians. Whatever kind of top person you hope to be, it's
not too early to get in training now by taking THE TIMES
regularly. Especially since, as a student, you're entitled to it
at half price: ask your newsagent or write to THE TIMES
Subscription Manager.

four-fifths: please do not write to point this out. Do write, however; if

from us and had we not chased
after the Editor to give him the
story, the whole affair would have
been forgotten.
This raises the question of how
many news items are lost because
the paper does not search for news
(viz. The Carol Concert).
I appreciate that the existing
staff are already overworked, so
could not all the year reps in the
college be charged with ferreting
for news in their year groups.
At the moment the paper seems
so be supported by a hard core of
writers who are often hard pushed
to find fresh material.

It is not always possible to include

topicality it was held over.

Dear Sir,
Since my arrival at this college
one of the most disturbing things
is the partitions between lava-
tories Very often they are only
partial, and do not reach to the
roof or to the floor. This is often
very distressing. Whilst I appreci-
ate the need for comradeship in an
institution of this size, surely it
need not go this far.

Dear Sir,
Now that an appeal has been
made for " Stynx " material we
feel that it is time to express our
dismay at the low standard set by
previous issues of the magazine.
Last year the Rector Received
complaints from the public and
expressed his disapproval of the
suggestive and crude articles pub-
lished. The opinion widely held
in the College, and especially
among Christians, is that much
could be done to improve the next
copy (and also the image of I.C.
which it carries to the public).
Last year's editor raised the ob-
jection that he received only a
minimum of material from mem-
bers of The College. We appeal
to members of I.C. to be less
apathetic and to supply plenty of
decept contributions so that of-
fensiVeness can be eliminated and
filth need never be a substitute for
humour.
Yours sincerely,

"But when the discourse turned
to questions of morals, self-con-

Felix became alarmed and ex-

Dear Sir,
In view of your rudely destruc-
tive criticism of Phoenix in your
last issue, I would like to suggest
that the aim of this magazine is tc
represent whatever talent this
college may muster. Hence, an}
criticism of Phoenix is a condem-
nation not of the editorial staff
but of the apathy or lack of ability
of students at this college.
Yours,

Salve, mate!
What grotty latin! The phrase
quoted in the last " Felix " (page
two) should read "Felix qui
potuit rerum cognoscere causas "
not, " Felix qui potuit recum
coquoscere causas."
Love,
