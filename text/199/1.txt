IRAQU1
STUDENT
FOUND
GASSED
We are extremely sorry to have
to report that an Iraqi student
I.C. took his own life last week.
He gassed himself in his digs on
Jan. 28th following an earlier
attempt on the 27th. A first year
Chemical Engineer, S. Hussein
seemed to have developed some
kind of phychological illness, and
was unhappy with his work at
College. Further news will be
given in the next Felix, and the
deepest sympathies are extended
to his relations.

PHOENIX RAISES
COLCUTT QUERY
B Y CHARLES B A G N A L L
A shroud of mystery to-day surrounds the Colcutt Tower, and
its future. Silence and speculation are the Keywords. Ever since
Bill McAulay, Editor of the new look Phoenix, published his strange
editorial, there has been a large question mark over the phrase
" Buildings are being demolished and erected and erected and demo-
lished with unparallelled speed." Rumours buzz throu' the airy
corridors of Southside and E I ; ; "is it the tower?"
The Colcutt tower has always been a centre of controversy. As
early as the 1851 exhibition, when it was erected along with the
Imperial Institute; public opinion has been sharply divided as to its
architectural merits.
But it was in 1956, three years
after the government's decision
" to authorise the expansion of
the Imperial College of Science
and Technology, South Kensing-
ton, in accordance with the
policy of establishing at last one
technological institution of Uni-
versity rank," that Colcutt's his-
toric building came under the
hammer.
CRAFTSMANSHIP
The College drew up plans for
the development of the central
site, which involved the demoli-
tion of the Imperial Institute, as
well as the Waterhouse buildings,
etc. The Royal Fine Arts Com-
mission objected. In a letter
dated 11th June, 1955, they said
"Nevertheless this great work of
Colcutt's, with its fine craftsman-
ship, is of outstanding signifi-
cance not only to South Kensing-
ton, but to London as a whole,
and should be preserved."
In a written reply, dated
January 20th, 1956, Mr. Henry
Brooke, then Financial Secretary
to the Treasury, said that the Im-
perial Institute would have to be
demolished.
PUBLIC OUTCRY
There was a public outcry and
throughout February the corre-
spondence colums of the Times
carried letters from John Betje-
man and his Victorian cronies,
and eventually the government
suggested to the college that the
tower alone should be reprieved,
since it was a building of histori-
cal interest. It was at this
time that the College purchased
the South Side site, and informed
sources say that this was on " a
tower for Southside" exchange
basis. And here the matter
stands.
M O R E L A N D
But Robbins has suggested I.C.
should expand to 4,750 students
and a very reasonable question is
" where are we going to put
them ? We need more land !"
