QUOTES
" We have a dynamic President
and Secretary this year."
"Highly ridiculous."
** As a matter of interest what
wereive voting against ?"
NICK W A L K E R WRITES
There was no sign of " apathy " in the council meeting on Mon-
day, 27th, if the volume of words was anything to judge by. Unfor-
tunately most of what was said was to no purpose whatever. Two
and a half hours were spent discussing the working party report; in
that time the President must have spoken for at least 1| hours. When
other members were allowed to talk they almost invariably strayed
from the point, yet the President did nothing to restore order.
Other than the President, five members almost monopolised the
conversation, speaking oyer 150 times. Of the rest of the twenty-
one present (out of a complete council of twenty-four) three spoke
more than five times, nine spoke four times, two once and one mem-
ber not at a l l ; perhaps he was too bored by the official waffle.
This should have been an important meeting yet six members
left before it was finished, three did not even arrive. Those R.C.S.
members who left to go to a sherry party ought to be ashamed—
I.C. Union is much more important now than R.C.S. ever will be.
Of the actual meeting not —
much can be said. The recom-
mendations it eventually passed
are :—-
1. A deputy President of I.C.U.
to be elected, to be in charge
of Union buildings, etc.
2. Another full time permanent
Clerk for I.C.U. (when money
is available).
3. A Halls of Residence Rep. on
Council.
A great deal of discussion took
place trying to decide on the title
of the new member of the execu-
tive, and whether instead of a
Deputy President there should be
a Srcretary for South Side and
one for Beit. This was rejected
owing to misunderstandings that
might arise over external affairs.
Everybody agreed that the
Union needed another Clerk—
mainly for Felix, Phoenix and
other similar bodies. I wonder
how long it will be before this
new clerk appears. If the Union
is as hard up as it makes out, it
will not be able to afford any
new employee. The one recom-
mendation passed which could
well affect most people in the
Union was to have a Halls of
Residence representative sitting
on Council. Council fully saw
the danger of letting the Halls
become too independent, and this
move may halt the present trend.
Also mentioned were whether
to reduce the number of General
Union members on Council and
the process of election of Union
officers. • The election of Presi-
dent was again put forward.
After much pointless discussion
enlightening no one, everyone,
with the notable exception of Mr.
Price, was so fed up that these
matters were left undecided.
Union Council is a waste of
tiriit; for those who sit on it, for
Mrs. Robb who has to take the
minutes, and for the Felix re-
porter who HAS TO report i t

Yet another competitor for
Felix! Hot footed, and short
winded, behind Goodlad, Babb
and the Second year /Electrical
Engineers, comes the United
Christian Societies' News Letter.
It is expected to be out next week,
price Id.
Chairman /of the S.C.C. and
non-bearded father figure of the
Religious Societies, Roy Ellis told
me, that it will contain general
and religious news."
" We expect it to circulate
amongst Christians and interested
parties," he said,
This is an historic step by the
I.C. Church Socs., who like their
mother Church have been dis-
united for years. The efforts of
Pope Paul are having far reaching
effects.
Felix wishes the venture suc-
cess.
CRANE CRASH
One man died when the jib section of a tower crane operating on the
R.C.S. site crashed 60 feet to the ground.
UNDER-
SEXED
The average I.C. student is
most definitely sexually apathetic.
This interesting conclusion has
been reached by Your Special
Correspondent after nearly three
years research. Surveys at both
Oxford and Cambridge have
shown that about forty per cent of
the female and about sixty per
cent of the male students experi-
ence sexual intercourse before
they graduate. Various estimates
at I.C. have put the figures at
between five and fifteen per cent
for the women and between ten
and thirty per cent for the men.
What are the possible reasons
for this situation? At Oxford the
student lives in an archaic society
of rules and regulations, with
severe punishments for the sexual
offenders. In London there are
few rules, and there is also far
more contact with the non-student
population. Surely one would
expect more promiscuity in Ixm-
don, yet at I.C. this is not the
case. Are Oxford students livelier,
more ready to experiment? Or
does the I.C. student come from a
different religious, social, and
moral stock? Or is it that regula-
tions cause the very situation
they are apparently trying to pre-
vent? There is probably a grain
of truth in all these suggestions,
but they cannot completely ex-
plain the figures quoted.
What conclusion can we arrive
at? A likely one must be that life
at. I.C. produces sexually timid
and apathetic citizens who don't
have the time or the ability to mix
often and easily with the opposite
sex.
