Phoenix
Mr. McAuley seems to have
produced something much more
digestible than past editors of
Phoenix. It was pleasing to be
able to distinguish between the
good parts and the rubbish, of
which there was noticeably little.
Mr. Rogers spoilt a reasonable
article by his bitter little comment1
on the union in the year 2000. He
must be a non-athletic type. The
most illconcieved article was Mr.
Berry's effort. Whilst we all realise
that Mr. Berry was the biggest
noise in the Bristol Union we also
realise that his efforts to become
even a small noise at IC have been
conspicuously rejected by his fel-
low students. Mr. Berry is very
much out of touch with what is
going on in IC union and he has
only been to one council meeting
as an observer, yet he tells us
what to do with our union. He
did make one pertinent suggestion
amongst all the impertinent ones,
namely the way in which the
Union elects its president. It is
now three years since the student
body decided to allow council to
elect the president, but three years
is time enough for the composi-
tion of the student body to change
appreciably, so what about giving
the present students a chance to
show what they want in the way
of election of the top union men.
Halls of Residence
Imperial College is fast becom-
ing a residential college, and
where life once centred around
the constituent unions entirely,
the halls are now becoming in-
creasingly important in student
affairs, despite what certain of
the old diehards may think. Now
at last council has been informed
of this important fact and has
taken action and created a Halls
of Residence representative. It
was a wise decision to allow the
halls to choose their own method
of election and for council merely
to invite them to send a represen-
tative. In this way, council has
assured that a healthy relation
will exist between the halls and
the union and the students wili
be able to fully enjoy the facilities
available in their hall, while still
retaining control over their social
and sporting activities.

In 50 years Brazil has reduced
her illiteracy rate from 65.3 to
50.6 per cent—but because of
population growth the number of
illiterates has actually risen two
and a half times. In many
countries illiteracy is rising even
faster. The International Planned
Parenthood Federation has a
Programme for this World Prob-
lem, and it is hoped that there will
be an International Evening de-
voted to this subject on Thursday,
Feb. 13th at 7.30 p.m.

Cast as Follows
A new Spanner has been
custom-cast in bronze, weighing
61 lbs. in its undercoat. It has
been hand engraved, and re-
striped. The ends are now highly
polished, so that alien finger prints
can be easily detected. Spanner
III will be inaugurated at the next
Union Meeting, which will be on
Thursday 6th February. The
agenda will include several im-
portant matters for discussion
such as I.C .Parking, and the
Union Working Party. Your ideas
will be welcome.
We have been given a cup by
L. J. Cardew Wood, the President
of the Old Centralians. A panel
of distinguished Art Critics will
annually award this cup to the
departmental group giving the
|most entertaining performance at
the Annual " Festival of Music
and Culture." This year the
Festival will " occur " during the
next Union meeting, and up to
four 25/- Guilds Carnival tickets
will be given to the winning
group, and their names and de-
partment will be engraved on the
W.C. Cup, which will be kept
in the I.C. Bar for annual re-
award each year.
Details of the individual De-
partmental entries should reach
either Yog Bishop or Rod Jones
by Wednesday evening.
Pedal Car Race
18 Guildsmen are entering two
Pedal Cars into the Bristol 24
hour Pedal Car Race. The cars,
which have been designed as a
second year Mechanical project,
are being built in the Mech. Eng.
workshops. The cars will cost
£20 each, and the proponents are
each contributing towards the cost
of the vehicles, and also their
travel expenses to Bristol.

The Hungry Horse
A farmer is fortunate enough
to possess three fields of identi-
cal size and grass-constitution.
In the first field he has four
horses which take five days to eat
all of the grass in that field. In
the second field three horses take
seven days feeding before going
hungry. In the third there is
only one horse; assuming that
each animal has an equal appe-
tite, how many days grazing has
the horse in the third field got ?
Clue: the horse is happy for
more than three weeks.

What do we want from graduates ? Here are some
thoughts from a Dagenham director, Mr. H. H. Jeffries.
Men who have really absorbed what universities can
offer—the mental power to analyse and adapt, to re-
ject the superficial answer, and to appraise new ideas
in terms of the future as well as the past. Men who
can uphold their views rationally and calmly in the
face of determined men trained in different disciplines,
or in none. Above all, men who can learn from life
itself the techniques of handling practical affairs.
Mr. Jeffries offers more food for thought in the cur-
rent edition of a NUS Brochure, " Choosing a Career."
Your appointments Officer can also tell you a lot about
us, and there is just time to book an interview.
We will leave you with one final thought. With Ford
you start at £840 per annum. In a few months this rises
to £936. Your first £1,000 is very close.
