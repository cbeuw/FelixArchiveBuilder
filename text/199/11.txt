Gup Hopes Crushed by Kings
I.C3 KINGS 5
— By a Felix Staff Reporter —
I.C. went out of the Gutteridge
Cup Wednesday before last when
they lost to a more balanced
Kings side which took advantage
of its brief domination of the game
in the first half and then closed the
door on I.C. until the very last
minute of time. The King's try
came in the 25th minute from a
copybook threequarter movement
starting at the halfway Tine and
ending almost under the posts. It
was easily converted.
From the restart, however,
I.C. moved the game into the
King's half and there it remained,
more or less, for the rest of the
match. The I.C. pack were get-
ting possession from nearly every
line out and set scrum, and com-
pletely overwhelming Kings in
the loose, but the services ren-
dered ,by their backs appeared
ordinary at the best of times and
was the real cause of I.C.'s ina-
bility to turn this territorial ad-
vantage into goals. Their passing
was generally • sloppy, especially
in the half backs, and the pass was
too often made before the oppos-
ing man had been drawn.
U N L U C K Y
To be fair, the I.C. threequar-
ters produced some exciting
movements from which they were
jnlucky not to score. Two of
:hese, in the 35th and 64th, min-
utes, resulted in Churchill going
over the line only to hear the
whistle blow for some previous
infringement. But they came all
too rarely in proportion to the
number of openings created by
the forwards.
I.C. SCORE
In the third minute of the
second half, Ravno hit the post
with a penalty kick, and it was not
until the 80th minute of play that
I.C. finally managed to score
when the forwards took command
of a five yard scrum, and surged
over the King's goal line to touch
down and narrow their opponents
lead to two points.
LAST DITCH
The conversion attempt, by
Ravno from a very difficult angle,
went wide and short, but in the
seemingly unending period of
injury time which followed, I.C.
threw everything they had into
attack. No sooner did one move-
ment end than another started and
only a last ditch covering by
Kings prevented the final result
from going to I.C.
One cannot help wondering if,
had I.C. used the forward rush
tactics of these dying minutes
more earlier in the game, they
would not have won the match
handsomely.

SOCCER
FIRST LEAGUE W I N
I.C. 2 L.S.E. 1
The first team played L.S.E.
at home knowing that they must
win all four remaining matches to
have a chance of avoiding relega-
tion. The addition of three Uni-
versity players (as London were
without a game) boosted hopes of
a victory.
I.C. attacked fluently from the
start and after only ten minutes
were one up as Kemp held off two
tackles to score from a through
ball., Chances abounded on the
slippery surface but the home
team, after crossing the ball well,
lacked finish, and the Beavers
were held by an I.C. defence of
unusual solidarity. Cox came
close to scoring when his first time
shot was stopped by an L.S.E. full
back on the line, but half time was
reached without addition to the
score.
The second half found I.C. still
in command and after continually
pressing White volleyed a goal
after crisp interpassing. After
Fisher had hit the back of the net
again L.S.E. started to have more
of the ball and 10 minutes from
the end pulled back to 2:1. I.C.
defence became a little panicky
and the final whistle was a wel-
come sound.
Of the Lower Teams
The Illrd are in to the semi-
final of the reserves cup after a
good win over King's II, 2 : 0
and play Q.M.C. II, on Saturday.

BOXING
Two I.C. boxers, M . Neville-
Polley and M . Harris, helped
London University to a 5-0 vic-
tory over Guy's Hospital London
on January 27th.
TENNIS
Enthusiasm for the winter
singles tournament, instituted last
term, seems to have dwindled to
nothing. So far only six games
have been played off out of forty-
two.
SPORTS DAY
Sports Day this year has been
provisionally arranged for Wed-
nesday, 6th May.
CROSS COUNTRY
Response to the Cross Country
Club's appeal for non-running
helpers for their Three Peaks
Relay attempt this Easter has
been "very good," according to
Pete Crews, the Club captain.
SOCCER
F R E E coaches will, as usual,
be running to the Soccer Cup
match this Saturday. See the many
Soccer club notices for departure
times from the Union.
ENTHUSIASTIC
SAILING
Vast enthusiasm at the begin-
ning of the year continued to
dominate last term. The freshers
gained many of the places in a
second team that lost witn de-
creasing regularity. Several of
the freshers showed an encourag-
ing ability to improve.
Dave Pentz meanwhile was
winning the University points
races in convincing style; Stevie
Vines was sailing for and E .
Twiname captaining the British
Universities.
