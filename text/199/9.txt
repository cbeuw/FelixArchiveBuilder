SOUTH SIDE
I am fed up with the trash and
ill-informed gossip printed in your
columns on this subject. The final
straw was the Colcutt comment in
your last edition.
The possibility of an Oxbridge
system arising in Southside is so
remote that it is purely of aca-
demic interest to defeat this pro-
posal. Suffice it to say that if such
a system seemed imminent, 98
per cent of the residents, including
myself, would leave the halls im-
mediately. With no residents the
halls could not operate.
Colcutt raises the issues of the
Warden's powers. Within limits
the wardens are free to run the
Halls as they like. However, if
they overstep the mark, they are
subject to: open rebellion by the
students, i(e.g. the famous "12
o'clock " rule), the halls commit-
tee, and finally they are respon-
sible to the Rector.
Colcutt has fought shy since the
Fuch's episode of warning people,
places, etc. I think, in general,
he has one warden in mind, Dr.
Cameron; let him give his reasons,
and perhaps he will make his
point. If he is against the system
of wardens to control halls, then
he must consider the only alterna-
tive—a student committee. After
seeing the confusion, red herrings,
and personal animosity which
accompanied the N.U.S. business
last year, I have my doubts about
student committees. I approve of
having the union building and its
facilities run by students, but I
do not want my home run by stu-
dents.
It is inevitable that some social
activity should be centred in the
halls themselves—after all, they
are the communities in which we
live. The student who lives in digs
is not censored if he goes to his
local cinema or pub. Why should
not the residents of the halls be
given the same freedom? There
are groups of people in Southside
with common interests, who meet
at (ir)regular intervals. Whether
or not they are " Clubs " within
the Union definition I do not
know, but they all represent
minority interests. Is the Union
interested in groups of people who
make brass-rubbings or push
ping-pong balls around with their
noses? If it is, it should adopt
these societies into its own organ-
isation and have done with it. It
is interesting that the Physics de-
partment started the Wooden
Horse Club)—an admirable group
and received the full blessing of
the Union, whereas any Southside
club is immediately condemned.
Gentlemen of IC, please re-
member that that strange animal,
the Southside dweller, is not a
warden's minion but a member of
our Union. We want to act as
Union members, not only indi-
vidually, but also corporately.
The friction between the Union
and Southside is not that great,
and could be removed, if muck
stirrers take the trouble to get the
facts straight before venturing
forth into long spiels. You are
the Union; you decide.

Two Views
The Imperial College system is
changing ; we are ceasing to be
a day-college and are gradually
becoming a residential Univer-
sity. It is time that the Union
became aware of this and stopped
bleating " Beware of Oxbridge
and Cameron.' That the future
of I.C. lies with the Halls and not
in the Constituent Colleges'
Unions is a view held more
widely than is generally sup-
posed ;; the question is, how can
the Union adapt itself to this in-
evitable change ? The great
fear is that the Wardens will grab
financial control and could as-
sume dictatorial powers. If the
Union is all that it claims to be
(and it has already shown itself
more than capable in this direc-
tion) then this could not possibly
happen.
The best way in which to
realise the potential of these
Halls will be to automatically
attach every member of College
to a particular Hall; all should
be encouraged to spend at least
one year in it, but this is not es-
sential. Each Hall could then
select teams, or have its own
clubs and functions—not all that
radical, it happens at present.
The major clubs would remain
I.C.U. clubs, and all would re-
ceive financial support and con-
trol from this source. The possi-
bilities are endless, and they
would all induce far greater
corporate participation than we
have at the moment. Only the
shortest-sighted will fail to see
that this is where our future lies.
Even if it does smell vaguely of
Oxbridge, it is the best of that
system, and does not include the
more unpleasant trimmings;
there is no reason why it should.
Footnote: In a long term finan-
cial view of the Union drawn
up by the Executive last term,
provision has been made for
inter-hall sport.
