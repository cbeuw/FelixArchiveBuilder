The Tory party wants " to be
judged both by the coherence of
its plans for the Future and er
. . . past achievements," accord-
ing to Mr. Maudling who spoke
at Imperial College last Tuesday.
In a somewhat disappointing
speech to a packed audience in the
Physics building, Mr. Maudling
gathered from the newspapers,
(" whom we ought to believe ")
that an election was imminent, so,
as part of his pre-election cam-
paign, he decided to speak on
Internal and Home affairs.
"Essential programmes must be
consistent with economic reality."
The sort of ambitious rate of
growth which can be achieved is a
4 per cent long term increase in
the national income. At present
we are rising at 5\ per cent, so
watch out, the squeeze will be
coming. Disregarding this dark
cloud on the horizon for the mo-
ment, the economic situation to-
day is one of progress. Education
takes up 3 - 4 per cent of the
budget and will soon rise to 5 per
cent as it is increasing all the time.
Expenditure on roads is going up
by 12 per cent on last year, but
what it was last year we were not
told . . . I wonder why?
The ten year hospital pro-
gramme is under way and then of
course, there is housing, while the
social benefits have gone up more
than incomes. Old people con-
tinue to share the Wealth of
Britain. We spend exactly ten
times as much on defence as we
do on education, but a defence
cut is not feasible in the light of
British prestige, depreciation
abroad and other factors. We
must also look toward the poorer
countries as already the Common
Market countries are giving them
more aid per capita than we are.
The Labour party must be
pressed to give a financial account
of its plans, they are probably a
bit over ambitious. Britain's
limiting factor is the availability of
skilled manpower, which must in-
dictate that all our unemployed are
unskilled. During question time,
Mr. Maudling, who is due for a
4,000 per cent, increase in pay
judging by national income sta-
tistics, refused to comment on the
present editor of the Spectator!

Mr. Jo Grimond, the head of
the Liberal party, spoke to an-
other packed main physics lecture
theatre on Thursday on the Poli-
tical Scene.
In a much more lively strain
than Mr. Maudling on Tuesday,
he went straight to the roots of
politics by saying, " Unless you
reform politics in this country, it
is very unlikely that the politicians
can reform anything else." At the
election the main issues in
politics should be discussed, but
there is danger that all the main
issues will be avoided.
Usually the argument is how to
spend someone else's money. The
question should not be " how
much Nuclear Power we wantto
have " but, " how much conven-
tional power are you willing to
pay for." Also, " whether you
want expansion by simple debase-
ment of currency." Politics must
become scientific, scientists are be-
coming respectable, while engin-
eers have some way to go.
The Houses of Parliament
simply have to be modernised. "It
is wholly illogical to concentrate
so much power into such an ine-
-fficient organization as the House
of Commons, who refuse even to
be televised.
DON'T YOU!
WHILE GOD HAS HIS
PROPHETS . . .
While God has his prophets the
Tory Party has its Royal Com-
missions. It takes a G.C.E. O-
level school boy to look at the
present figures and calculate the
number of college-capable people
we will have on our hands in ten
years' time, but when Lord Rob-
bins announces it, it comes " like
a lightning blast from Mount
Sinai."
Scientists should become poli-
ticians and leave the politicians to
handle debates. Mr. Grimond
said " I am a politician, I love
politics, and I'm quite happy to go
back this afternoon and make life
hell for such ministers that I can
find there "
