A Carnival Appeal
Carnivals come, and accom-
panied by a couple of thousand
quid for some deserving cause,
Carnivals go ; those hectic sum-
mer days and nights are soon
over, the glasses and balloons
and other evidences are cleared
away, and only that distinctive
smell remains. Hence, STYNX,
the guide, souvenir de luxe, and
major fund raising publication of
I.C. Carnival, this year to be a
more interesting and unusual
complex of wit, graffiti and
double exposures than ever be-,
fore, and likely to make us mis-
understood for aeons, since we
would rather intrigue than tire.
Stynx in 1964 will play no lewd
or sordid role. The world-weary
sophistication of the Editor Lad-
die) (I heard that one when you
were carrying a satchel), and the
popular demands from Tun-
bridge Wells, will combine in
shaping a reflection of clean, up-
standing Youth.
" But," you may say, and well
indeed may you say it. "This
will not be the Stynx we remem-
ber. This will not be Stynx at
all!"
" True," we will say in reply.
Wherefore, we announce that any
suggestions for the baptism of the
Son of Stynx be submitted forth-
with, and the most acceptable
will be adopted ; on the other
hand the best suggestions will be
on private view. Frankly we re-
gret the circumstances which pre-
vent this infant bearing his
father's name.
Well, then, since obviously we
are appealing for original Copy
in addition to the small matter of
a name, what do we want ? Con-
sider the Undergrads and P.G.s
who by first and second degree
persuasion must sell 7,000 copies;
most will be to the Public, avari-
cious and not to be satisfied
merely by the glow of giving. We
want to hint at a rosy-tinted
spectacle of our College Life to
these readers now but dimly
aware of us. Since our charity
will benefit, we need not be too
bashful about a little self-adver-
tisement.
So formerly was featured the
launching of the I.C.B.M., a
stone rocket 200 ft. high, from
the pad adjacent to the Albert
Hall, with many authentic photo-
graphs ; and to-day the plan for
the Hyde Park Precinct, with the
Dorchester and Grosvenor House
Halls may well be of more than
parochial interest. We recall,
too, when even mascot hunting
lost for a1
^moment its usual
childishness, on that occasion
when the Queen's Tower was
covertly spirited away to a better
foundation.
Perhaps you may know of yet
more dramatic moments in our
rough island site story. If you
do, or if you have any other out-1
pourings of your private Muse,
please send all details, either to
me, c/o the Union Rack, or to
the Assistant Editor, Dick
Reeves, at 346, South Side. And
if your problem is one you do
not wish to commit to paper
(such as an urge to volunteer to
help on the Board !) then in the
first instance, knock on 346.
We need copies of last year's
Stynx for sending to potential ad-
vertisers. If you've finished read-
ing your copy, we should be
grateful for it. As a donation.

TRADING
STAMPS ,
IN T H E B A R f
It has been rumoured in high-
up circles in the Union that the
trading stamp system is soon to be
introduced to the College. As an
attempt to attract students from
the Ennismore, Queen's, Denmark
etc., it is proposed that the Col-
lege bars will offer Green Shield
Stamps with drinks and cigarettes.
The tarnished trophies and dreary
tankards in the glass-case behind
the Union bar will be replaced by
a selection of the attractive gifts
purchasable with stamps. Stamp
Bonuses, perhaps double the
usual issue, might be given to
active and prominent members of
the Union in recognition of their
efforts.
It is also suggested that the idea
be extended to the Mooney Em-
pire in an effort to reinforce his
now steadily decreasing queues;
and perhaps also to the bookstall,
an encouragement to everyone to
work harder and consume reams
of foolscap.
At the risk of appearing friv-
olous, might I make a plea on
behalf of those who have no desire
to own a vacuum cleaner or gar-
den rake, that stamps might be-
come an acceptable currency for
the payment of hostel fees, the
barber, or say, subscription to
scrutiny?

The idea that having an account with a nation-wide bank like the
Midland is something reserved for people of substantial means is a
fallacy. So also is the belief that banks are interested only in those
who are older and already established. The Midland Bank is inter-
ested in YOU â€” and all young people like you. You would find a
bank account extremely useful for, besides the convenience of pay-
ing bills by cheque, you will find that it helps you to keep track of
your expenditure.
