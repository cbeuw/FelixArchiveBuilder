The Old lady was allowed through the
Park unimpeded,although accosted i n
Exhibition Road by a gentleman(?) i n
blue,whose lack of humour may hare been
due to a vulgar noise she has recently
acquired.
It waa regretted that Bo and Clem-

LETTER TO M I S - G U I D E D
Dearest IJinotchka
with the so very
enchanting round figure, why have
you l e f t the warmth of my bosom for
the cold loneliness of the outer space?
With every glimpse I have of you, my
heart rockets up and satellises: and I
wish that I could lay my burning fore-
head upon your cool, cool hands.
Perhaps, you misguided one, you
have been seduced by the man i n the
noon. T i l l you return, there w i l l be
no more songs i n the a i r , or sweet coo-
ing lovers i n the shadow of the Kremlin,
So please cone back to your
beloved,
Ze-arth.

A balding gentleman with a crew-

last weekend. On the table i n front
of him was the lntest copy of 'The

food for thought.
