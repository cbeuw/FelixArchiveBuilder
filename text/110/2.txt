F E L I X
HEBRIDEAN EXPEDITION
BOTANISTS, VISIT ORANSAY
Daring August this year, a party of
seven members of the Zoology Department
took part i n an expedition to the Isle of
Oransay, one of the most westerly islands
of the Inner Hebrides. I t was led by
Bob Sturrook who, with the rest, had just
completed his second year i n the Zoology
Dept., and included two g i r l s .
The t r i p was run to gain experience
i n planning, camping and working under
expedition conditions and to see how the
the members survived each other's company
over a reasonable period of time. Armed
with this knowledge, the planning of an
expedition to Ghana i n 1958, to follow
the one this year, should be greatly
facilitated.
On August 1st. s i x Members joined the
seventh on the island to start the camp.
They had failed to meet three days e a r l i e r
because of a failure on B r i t i s h Railways
which resulted i n the main party being
unable to catch their boat. Yfliilst
refusing to accept responsibility,
B r i t i s h Railways generously footed the
b i l l for extra expenses incurred during a
three day "Tour of the Scottish Islands"
as the party made i t s way by an alternatve
route to i t s destination.
For the next three weeks no major set-
backs interfered with the camp and l i f e
progressed smoothly. Problems, including
an investigation of l i t t o r a l insects, a
survey of the distribution of craneflies,
an examination of the liverfluke *)f the
island and general biological collecting,
were carried out with reasonable success.
A revealing insight into island l i f e was
obtained one night during a "Ceilidh1
'
(pronounced caley as in tray) on a
neighbouring island - the effects of
which were visible for several daysj
After this, gales from various direct-
ions combined with heavy rain showers
began to play havoc with the camp. A l l
the tents were damaged and running repairs
had to be made continuously under a l l
conditions of gale, v i s i b i l i t y and rain.
Eventually four of the aeven tents
collapsed under the strain. Two of these
were of a design reputed by the makers to
have been tested i n a South Georgia
winter - some comment on our English
summer! Throughout this period the
morale of the camp remained high,
although we lost one member for external
uncontrollable personal reasons (female).
With the subsidence of the gales the
expedition ran quietly to an end. On
August 30th. camp was struck and members
regretfully l e f t the islands for their
homes. The kindness of the islanders
impressed i t s e l f an everyone and their
hospitality w i l l be long remembered.
The whole venture was undoubtedly
successful and provided a l l the
experience hoped far. A detailed report
w i l l be given to the R.C.S. Natural
History Society sometime i n November,
together with a film made during the
t r i p .

R.C.A. WASHED
Attempts have recently been made to
improve the f a c i l i t i e s of the Huxley
Building. They necessitated the draining
of the central heating system. The heating
engineers eventually did arrive to r e f i l l
the system, a l l going well u n t i l lunchtime
when the job was only half-finiahed. True
to the tradition of B r i t i s h Workmen, every-
thing stopped for tea; that i s , except the
water supply to the radiators which was
l e f t running. The Inevitable happened.
Slowly but unceasingly the water crept
higher and higher; one by one the radiators
started to leak. I t was found later that
a l l the air. release vents had been l e f t
open, and several laboratories were flood-
ed as a result.
The 'piece de resistance', however, was
the culmination of the whole episode. The
cold water (hot never goes throtudi these
radiators) at last reached the top of the
heating system and issued forth from an
upper-otorey window aa a long, penetrating
jet; so penetrating, i n fact, that a row
of motor- bicycles parked outside the
neighbouring Royal College of Art reoeived
an unasked f o r , but nevertheless 'alghly
effective, shower bath.
TO WORK IN THE
ANTARCTIC
Every year a large number of those
leaving I.C. go abroad i n search of a
change of scenery, or money, usually
both. But very few have travelled aa
far away as C.M.Smith (ex-Cham. Dept.)
intends to go. He w i l l spend the next
two and a half years at a F.I.D.S. base
in the Argentine Islands, Graham Land,
Antarctica. As a change from organic
chemistry he w i l l be doing meteor-
ological work, some of i t i n connection
with the International Geophysical Year.
Martin, who i s well known i n the
College for his mountaineering and
photographic a c t i v i t i e s , sails scon on
the "John Biscoe", and after a short
stay i n Port Stanley he w i l l be landed
at the base, which he w i l l share with
eleven other scientists, the penguins
and'the seals. His 3pare time i s to be
spent doing photography and. bird-ringing.
We rather think that he w i l l find
l i f e a l i t t l e b i t quieter down there
than i t i s i n I.C.
N O T F O R E N G I N E E R S
They've thrown us together, those Chemists up there
And I hope you w i l l see that i t ' s really unfair â€”
You're merely a number, whilst I have a name;
Our status i n l i f e i s hardly the same.
A l l thermodynamics can't make us combine
For I'm Kangarooin and you are 1-9.
PEANUTS.
