The Planning Office has come i n for
considerable castigation, both i n these
columns and elsewhere, during the last
three years. Their latest embarrassment
i s the"pirated" a r t i c l e that appeared i n
the MANCHESTER GUARDIAN recently, describ-
ing the plans for the new Prince's Gardens
Hostel,
The College, i t transpires, has sug-
gested that the hostel be designed i n such
a way that during the long vac. i t con be
converted into hotel accomodation of a
standard that would be attractive to Amer-
ican tourists. This i s an excellent idea.
Although new to this country, i t i s very
common i n Scandinavia, where such hotels
are exceedingly popular.
The advantages of the scheme are ob-
vious. We congratulate the Planning Office
and trust that they w i l l carry i t out with-
out skimping on materials and workmanship.
We have too many examples of false economy
around us already. Only the best w i l l stand
up to student wear and tear, and only the
best w i l l appeal to our v i s i t o r s from abroad.

Commemoration Day i a shortly upon us
again. To a l l those who have never attend-
ed, especially freshers, we say see for
yourself what goes on. I t i s a side of
College l i f e that i s a l l too rarely glimps-
ed. Apart from anything else, you get the
rest of the day off and a free tea into tlm
bargain.

As usual at the beginning of the
session, the Lower Refectory i s bearing the
brunt of the lunchtime scramble. Freshers
are reminded that lunches are also served
in the Upper Refectory (top floor of the
Union ), i n Queenies (Ayrton Hall) and In
the refectory under the Imperial Institute.
Sandwiches are available i n the Hew Lounge

SATURDAY H O P S
Dear S i r ,
Last year there were faint
rumours of the Entertainments Committee
organising a l l our informal dances, with
no Club hops. Let us hope that we are
to be spared this fate, i f last
Saturday's hop was an example of the
best the E.C. can do.
What i s t h i s ridiculous nonsense of
having Ladies' Invitation and Ladies'
Exouse-me dances? These appeared to be
equally unpopular both with the men and
the ladies present. May we express cur
surprise and disgust at having a 'change
partners' dance at 10.45 pm. This sort
of thing w i l l t o t a l l y change the
traditional character of I.C. hops.
We cannot have band leaders taking
charge of our dances and running them as
though this were an East End Working
Men's Club! The M.C. should definitely
be a responsible member of this College,
and not a band leader.
Lastly, we must protest about the
extreme d i f f i c u l t y of obtaining drinks.
The organisers of the dance should have
been prepared f or the large number of
people requiring drinks.
The E.C. should set a better example
on how to run a hop, especially after
their criticism of several Clubs last
year over the organisation of their
dances.
Yours, i n disgust,
P.S.Smith
P.Porgess.
TRIPE!
My dear Felix,
Tour Uncle Phoenix
(remember him?) begs a l l freshers to cons-
ider him at this time and to ask themselves
whether or not they might have some d e l -
ightful short story, an essay or two,
an a r t i c l e , a set of anecdotes, some art;
just a drib or drab of something up their
sleeves.
Should they have such talent
surely they are bound t n f i l i a l obligation
to contact The Editor, The Phoenix o/o the
Union Rack as soon as possible so that
the Christmas Editionof Phoenix due out i n
the f i r s t week of December may be truly
ambitious.
My benevolent greetings,
Phoenix

Dear S i r ,
I would advise your readers to
take no heed of your so-called remedy
for Asian ' f l u . The last man to try i t
woke the whole hostel up at one i n the
morning y e l l i n g that his btd was on
f i r e . The Warden came and pulled him
out. "Ton b — — y idioty he remarked.

Dear S i r ,
FELIX always used to be f i r s t with
the news of College affairs. Why i s i t ,
then, that we have to read the MANCHESTER
GUARDIAN i n order to learn of the latest
details of the hostels i t i s proposed to
build i n Princes' Gardens.
Why cannot we get the news that we
want and pay for?
Tours sincerely,
K. C. Reader.
