VIEWPOINT
O B September 29th, there appeared
in. Reynolds News an a r t i c l e by a Dr.
Brian Welbeck assailing our educational
system and the products thereof, with
particular emphasis on the s c i e n t i f i c
and technological aspects, bringing up
some points quite commonly met with.
Dr. Welbeok asserted that present-
day sixth-formers suffer from a surfeit
of sports and scdenoes. They are not
being taught to think f a r themselves,
but merely have the contents of other
men's minds pouredt into their own.
"Everything that might Broaden the
scholar's mind and encourage tvftn t o
browse i n wide pastures of culture,
literature and philosophy has heem
drastically pruned. Latin and
©reek and the wealth of human culture
that they open up are supppsed to be
dead subjects? I t appears to us neces-
sary t o point out, once and for a l l ,
that literature and philosophy, Latin
and Greek just do not constitutes every-
thing that might broaden a scholar's
mind. Does this insistence on teaching
the culture of the past, while young
minds are being actively stimulated
by the s c i e n t i f i c achievements that
are taking place now (the Russian
earthi-satellite provides a topical
example) betray some rather out-of-
touchi wishful thinking? We shall return
to this point.
"One can be a good technician
while remaining something less than
human, while being v i r t u a l l y uneduc-
ated" writes Dr..Welbeck. Agreed.
One can. And who has not heard of
the lawyer, schooled i n Greek and Latin,
who spends his time doing nothing but
looking up precedents.
"... a c i v i l i z a t i o n i s judged,
not by i t s machines of war, but by i t s
creative a r t i s t s , i t s ltierature, i t s
philosophy and i t s poets" Well, there
has been nothing new at the R.A. Summer
Exhibition f o r donkeys' years. How many
giants of literature and poetry are
there nowadays? Dr. Welbeck seems t o
realise that the Latin-Greek culture
i s dying a slow death — he does not
realise that i t i s being inevitably
superseded by a new culture, with
mathematics the l i v i n g language; a
culture appealing to the youth, of to-
day because i t signifies progress. He
does not admit that Science i s creative.
Readi the newspapers, Dr. Welbeck. The
only creative people nowadays are Scien-
t i s t s and Technologists. When our civ-
i l i z a t i o n i s judged according t o i t s
works, the discoveries of the former
and the more tangible monuments of the
l a t t e r w i l l stamp this age as the re-
naissance.
Dr. Welbeck goes on: "
W
e honour
the Romans not because they were skil-
led engineers but because they laid th
foundations of Civil Law? Do the
aeneefueta deserve no honour? "Comparing
ouraalvas with, the kiddle Ages which
produced the Cathedrals, we must blush
to think that the best we oan show are
monstrous office blocks and the inter-
continental ballistie missile" One need
not quote examples to show that Dr.
Welbeok is here compering the best of
one world with the worst of another. A
scientific education would have taught
him objectivity, while one might hear i a
Bind that in those same Middle Ages
Galileo Galilei was. persecuted and
imprisoned for supporting the view that
the planets revolved round the sun.
"The 19th century ... produced MEN
... men who were not afraid to think
widely, to challenge accepted citadels
of thought..." Were not the atomic
theory and the quantum theory evolved
by such men? Asa. are not today's cit-
adels being challenged by Scientists?
Dr. Welbeok has already stated his
preference for the Civil Law of the
Romans and the architecture of the Mid-
dle Ages.
una f i n a l quotation: "Today we turn
out, by the score, conveyor-built pimply-
faced l i t t l e scientists and chemists who
think that the whole world is Bounded by
a test-tube! Welbeck has no weapon save
r i d i c u l e with which to attack us. Heaven
help him. His a r t i c l e , l i k e too many
others, conjures up a picture, of a man
running round i n c i r c l e s , sensing that
he has lost something but ignorant o f
what he seeks and how to f i n d i t . unable
to face the future, he takes refuge
behind a door that i s very nearly closed.
