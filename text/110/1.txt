Why isn't the gymnasium finished yet?
Once again we, the members of the Union,
are suffering from the incompetence of the
powers that he to plan anything i n such a
way that i * i s completed on time, or even
within months of ths specified date.
A week before the beginning of this
term, workmen moved i n to carryout work
that was ordered to be done last WAT.
Ifore time seems to be spent drinking tea
than doing the work that the tax-payer i s
paying f o r .
The whole business of the gymnasium
Is one of blunders: this may sound a
strong word to use, but i t s s u i t a b i l i t y
is demonstrated by the following facts:
1, The gym was designed i n sueh a way
that i t i s two feet too short for Bad-
minton. Consequently the Badminton Club
w i l l suffer for a good many years by bar-
ing to play on outside courts.
2. The radiators sera f i t t e d into re-
cesses i n the walls so that they would
be out of the way, leaving the wjklls f l a t
so that b a l l games could be played i n
safety. However, over the radiators were
b u i l t box arrangements which protruded
about three inches from the walls, mak-
ing b a l l games highly dangerous. This was
both unnecessary and stupid, when a simple
f l a t panel was a l l that was required. At
great expense these are at last being mod-
i f i e d by continuing the panelling along the
whole length of the wall- The result looks
S C I E N T I F I C A L L Y D E S I G N E D \
extremely shoddy and the finished article
is not nearly as good as i t would have
been I f the job had been done correctly
ths f i r s t time.
3. The ropes are s t i l l awaited, and i t i s
rumoured that we mlidit eventually get some
wallbars.
4. The date of completion i s s t i l l
In conclusion, the athletio clubs are
to be congratulated on the restraint they
have shown, and our sympathies go to thorn
for a l l the inconveniences they have had to
put up with.
BALL GAME PLAYERS
VINDICATED
A comment that appeared i n the Editor-
i a l of a recent copy of Phoenix with
reference to "ball-gams players* being
unfitted t o choose a grand piano was
disproved on Thursday, Oot. 3rd. The
new piano, chosen by Council i n prefer-
ence to a baby grand as suggested by
some members of the S.C.C. whose mem-
bers were directly oonneoted with the
instrument, was moved against s l l i n s t -
ructions t o the Upper Refectory. The
piano bought by the Union l a s t term
was intended t o remain on the stage and
be used by professional musicians.
An over snthuaiastio group of i r r e s -
ponsible members of our Union man-
handled *je piano t o ths Upper Refectory.
She front wss forced off and the look
badly damaged i n an endeavour t o make the
instrument available t o the Jazz Band.
During the course of the evening two
large burns appeared on the top - ob-
viously made by smouldering cigarettes.
The "ball-game players" are d e a r l y
mare i n touch with the standard of
behaviour of the OTHER Union Mashers.
