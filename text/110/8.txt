SOCCER
The t r i a l s were held at Harlington
on October 2nd. and 5th. i n glorious
weather. Ths standard of the t r i a l i s t s
was good hut there were few players of
f i r s t team standard. College football
i s faster and more robust than the
football played at most schools, and
when the freshmen become accustomed to
the change than more w i l l qualify f o r
places i n the top teams. I t i s there-
fore better that these players are
seleoted for lower teams at f i r s t , but
this w i l l not mean that their claims
t o better football w i l l be forgotten.
About 110 students have indicated
their wish to play football f o r the
College. I t i s impossible f o r ths club
to include everybody at f i r s t , but
selection of tho teams w i l l be as f a i r
as possible, entirely on a b i l i t y , and
the competition for places should prove
a great incentive to everyone.
RUGBY
The Club'i. t r i a l s , whioh were hold
at Harlington on Wednesday and Saturday,
were very successful and attracted well
over 100 players. This year's F i r s t
Eleven should be as strong as ever and
the lower teams, apart from a certain
shortage of full-backs and fly-halves,
should also do well.
Teams f o r Saturdays are normally
posted on the Rugby Club notice board on
Tuesday lunchtlmes. Flayers are asked
to look at this notice board, whioh i s
just outside the Bar, early i n the week
and not leave i t u n t i l Friday afternoon.
If available for the match, players
should put a t i c k beside t h e i r names
and i f not available, a cross. I t i s
essential that players whose names
appear on the reserve l i s t should also
t i c k off as no Club oan function with-
out reserves. Fast experience has shown
that almost every reserve who ticks off
gets a game; any reserve who ticks off
two weeks i n succession w i l l be picked
for a side i n the t h i r d week.
Players who went to the U.L. t r i a l s
and who now want to play f o r I.C. should
sign the l i s t they w i l l f i n d on the
notice board.

CROSSCOUNTRY
So f a r t h i s season ths Crosscountry
Club has had no competitive fixtures,
but two t r i a l s have been held. I f the
freshers f u l f i l the promise they have
shown i n the t r i a l s , we oan perhaps hops
for another season as successful ss the
l s s t , when we won the university Champ-
ionship and were seoond i n the Hyde Park
Road Relay.
Two very useful additions to our
membership are R.C.Landbeck (ex-South-
ampton) and J.F.Jaeger (ex-Cambridge),
and also freshers A.Brown, A.Brash and
K.Ludlam showed considerable promise.
However, of greater importance, i s the
fact that the Club has gained a f a i r l y
large number of freshers of moderate
a b i l i t y who w i l l form the packing
strength of the Club i n the future.

Freshmen were shown, round the Boat-

pleasant event, the more serious

swing with s i x Fresher crews being
boated and tanked on Saturday.
The Morphy and Lowry crews have
already started their training f o r

RIDING CLUB
During the recent vac. three members
of the Club spent an eventful 16 days
trekking through Yorkshire, both high and
low, reoeiving quite incredible hospitality
at many of the farms visited. V i s i t s wore
made to both racehorse and showjumping
trainers, while the tour ended with a v i s i t
to the York Music Festival and a rids back
to Burnley.
The only discomforts experienced were
due to non-waterproof tents (on two oc-
casions), and ones or twice the nobis
animals mistook human feet for stones —
and trod on thorn.
I t Is hoped to rids In a similar trek
on the continent next summer, probably i n
Swltssrlsnd.
SAILING
*Fom»l*"wi»a trophy
On 5 t h . and 6 t h . October racing at
the Welsh Harp was f o r open competition
and entries arrived from nine Clubs
scattered over the Thames area, i n
addition to the College, University, and
l o c a l Clubs.
"Fumble* (Janet Stevens and Mike
Collyer) got the winning gun i n the
practice race, and went on to win the
Welsh Harp Sailing Association's Autumn
Trophy from a fleet of 52 starters.
(Note: The Trophy was won i n 1955 by
s i s t e r ship "famulus", also I.C.^.
"Faust", sailed by fresher Graham
Taylor, received a consolation prize for
a good performance i n very light airs,
and we hope the Club may benefit from
Graham's talent.
For the information of those who
do not already know, the names of the
I.C .Sailing Club's boats are:
Fumble, Famulus, Faust, Furious, Felix
( a l l National Firefly class).
ATHLETIC CLUB
Though I.C.A.C. functions mainly i n
the summer term, i t i s hoped that members
(and would-be members) w i l l take an active
interest i n the Club In the winter terms.
Weight-lifting and circuit training fac-
i l i t i e s w i l l be provided as soon as the
I.C. and U.L. ermnasia are opened. At
present both are temporarily closed; the
former for repairs and the latter for
draining as i t was flooded when the awinf-
ming bath at U.L.U. was f i l l e d .
One fixture takes place this term.
This i s the University's third Winter
f i e l d Events and Relays Competion. Last
year we lost the"TJalve Trophy" for f i e l d
events to Middlesex Hospital and were
second i n the relays. We particularly
request F.E. men to reserve Wed. 13th
Nov. to add their support to the I.C.
team. By strengthening our F.E. section,
especially i n the Jumping events,we can
go a long way towards achieving our aim
of regaining our t i t l e of University
champions-which was loat to University
College last year.
The attention of a l l members,old
or new,of any standard,and whether inter-
ested i n the Winter meeting or not,is
drawn to the Atfeletio Club lotioe Board
(situated outside the Bar) where a
notice concerning a l l i s exhibited.
