The following i s an aeoount of
tha I.C. Xoologloal Expedition to Ghana
which took place this rammer, sponsored
by the Exploration Boardi -
Ghana i s a young oonntry and i s
almost- Impatient i n i t s desire to
solve Its many problems, especially
the agricultural ones. The object of
our expedition was ecologies! explo-
ration with an economic inclination
and touched on the most fundamental
tropical problem, which i s s o i l con-
servation. The usual method of farming,
away from the coastal plain, i s by
clearing the mature forest and planting
crops i n the forest s o i l . The sun im-
mediately begins to dry the humus and
the s o l i nutrients, now no longer held
by an extensive root system, are etched
away by the rain, and the area Is a l -
lowed to degenerate to a secondary bush
vegetation.
The focal point of the investigat-
ions of the three entomologists, two
botanists and the s o i l scientists was
the factors affecting the formation
and destruction of humus, although each
member also studied isolated subjects.
Two main areas were studied. One was a
strip transect i n the Bobiri forest
Reserve extending from a stream through
a swamp, into thick forest on a slight
h i l l ; the other was once a swamp by a
river but has been drained and deforest-
ed and now supports an annuel crop of
rloe. Rice has only reoently been intro-
duced there and the area can probably
be compared direotly withthe other swamp
which i s s t i l l forested.
During the eight weeks several
tripe were made by one or a l l of the
members, and Wiawso, Cape Coast, Ach-
imota university i n Ghana, Kano i n Nig-
eria, and Agades on the fringe of the
Sahara were a l l v i s i t e d . A truck and
driver were supplied by the department
of Agriculture i n Komasi (the capital
of Ashanti) to make the trips i n Ghana
possible. Kumasi i s only 20 miles from
the Bobiri Reserve, and as i t i s the
headquarters of the Opposition Party,
we got a good idea of the background to
the deportations, riots and court oases
which have occurred recently.
The expedition weur led by Hick
Jago who, together with Janet Petersen
and Joyce Farmer organised the cook
and two steward boys who performed our
chores, We lived i n two mosquito-proof
bungalows, fortunately equipped with a
refrigerator which was constantly main-
tained by Chris Green. This machine i s
of v i t a l importance when the tempera-
ture i s constantly around 80 degrees
Fahreneit and the relative humidity
i s 100 *.
On October 1st we should be i n
Freetown, Sierra Leone, where we are
assured of a pleasant stay, as i t i s
the home town of Hilton Jarrett, the
s o i l soientist. At the moment (Sept.
27th) we are only one day from Tak-
oradi Harbour, In a freeling tempera-
ture of 76 F, on our way to a B r i t i s h
ainter and a l o t of work awaiting us.

The University Grants Committee has
recently produced the report of i t s sub-
committee cm Halls of Reslaonce. This
50-page document published by Her Majesty' i
HuMmtxy Office, i s very good value f o r
three shillings.
It discusses the whole problem of
ensuring that every student derive* tha
f u l l benefits of a university l i f e . I t
strongly advocated the provision of more
Halls of Residence as the means of doing
t h i s . Only when a l l students spend a
period i n residence (the report recommends
at l e a s t two years and preferably mare)
w i l l the bruwnbagging 9 to 5 mentality
be eradicated.
The v i t a l educational role of hostel
l i f e should be of great interest to
Imperial College, f o r whose students ten
of so new hostel units, each containing
about 90 residents, are to be build i n
Prince* Gardens during the next few (?)
years.
The booklet discusses a student
who, having just l e f t school, continues
to l i v e at hone whilst attending college.
To him are denied "the stimulus of fresh
scenes, the exhilaration of independence,
the sense that a new adventurous phase of
l i f e i s pending"'. Digs may have the
advantage of being much doses- to oollege,
but are a very poor second to l i v i n g i n
a hostel. They are l i a b l e to be expensi-
ve, and acme are squalid and d i f f i c u l t
to work In. As the report says, "digs
do nothing to help a student to i n t e r -
pret the wnivorsity world". I t goes
on to emphasise the " c i v i l i s i n g and
humanising" influence of a hostel. Half
of a student's university education i s
obtained i n his college department, the
other half, equally important, by mixing
with his fellow students. Only a resident
oan appreciate the second half f u l l y . He
oan obtain a thoroughinterchange of ideas
with his fellows and can benefit from an
understanding of the co-operation and
teamwork whioh spring from l i v i n g i n a
student community.
The report recommends a mixture of
a l l "years" and postgraduates i n hostels,
and emphasises tha importance of a sprink-
l i n g of staff, as well, i n order to im-
prove staff-student relationships. Mem-
bers of staff should act as "moral tutors*
to the students.
A hostel depends a great deal, says
the report, on the preaonality of its
warden. Bis must he resilient! And host
The sub-oommittec thinks that the post
of warden should be held in university
status: that the onetime possession of
a wardenahip should count favourably whan
Sfppedataents to professorehips are Being
made. This produces one Implication
whioh will have to be watched carefully
at X.C. Hitherto ear wardens and sab-
wardens have been asm with.a genuine aad
active interest in student affairs: they
have taken on the job more as a beany
than for money. Hew i t seena possible
that an aafcitioea academician may seek a
wardenship for purely professional ends,
and i t is unlikely that he would make a
satisfactory and tolerant warden. It ia
to he hoped that there will always be eaJV
ficdent staff to take on wardonshias far
the fun and great interest i t oan pro-
vide rather than possible promotion later.
The report also attempts to discuss
the possible impact of a large residential
population! i n various h a l l s , each holding
about 100, en college l i f e i n general.
Bare i t i s impossible to generalise on
the complementary functions of halls and
unions: 80 much depends on the distance
that the halls are froa the college
centre, the existence of an active union
etc., and t h i s i s different f o r every
university i n the country. The report
speaks of athletic clubs run by each h a l l :
students not actually i n residence would
be considered as 'associate members* of
a hall f o r this purpose, with the right
to use lounges and fl-trHwg rooms i n the
h a l l . This, no doubt, i s a reasonable
idea for a oollege or university â€¢where
the halls are scattered and remote from
the Union or social center. But at I.C.,
with a large and active Union, which
divides naturally into the three consti-
tuent oollege unions when the situation
or numbers demand, i t seems unlikely that
any of the halls i n Princes Gardens w i l l
feel any need to organise their own
major a c t i v i t i e s . The I.C. Governing Body
report, 1955-56, emphasised that the
Princes Gardens project was designed to
encourage the corporate feeling of the
oollege as a whole, and a l l residents
would use the same refectories and lounges.
Nevertheless each h a l l w i l l need acme
sort of administering committee, l i k e the
present hostel's Resident's Committee
whioh, happily, contains a considerably
greater student representation than the
U.G,C'& report appears to think right a
and proper.
This sub-committee's report has been
based on evidence received from many uni-
versities and colleges. The university
Grants Committee v i s i t e d I.C. i n November,
1955, and i t i s very satisfactory to r e c a l l
that the Union Council's memorandua to
the oooBittee was devoted entirely to
a request f o r more halls of residence,
for reasons similar to those described
in acme sections of this report. The
purchase of Princes Gardens followed a
few months later. This Council was
subjected to the perennial and t o t a l l y
irrelevant criticism that i t contained
too many sporting and ball-games types.
They certainly seem to have h i t the b a l l
good and hard on this occasion.
