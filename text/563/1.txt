D o n M u n r o , Senior W a r d e n
and C h a i r m a n of the Residence

that the extent of the complaints
w e r e " v e r y s w e e p i n g " . T h e
ladies brought up a n u m b e r of
complaints to D o n M u n r o a n d
R a e Snee on M o n d a y , mainly
concerning noise from Southside
and Linstead.
T h e meeting didn't start too
well; one of the ladies is quoted
as saying: " W e are not going to
believe anything you say because
you've told us nothing but lies
in the past".
T h e ladies went so far as to
suggest that the heating in the
halls needs serious investigation
as windows are often left wide
o p e n i n w i n t e r w i t h s t e r e o s
blaring out over the mews. T h e
incident that sparked offthe latest
series of complaints was L i n k
III, an electric J a z z b a n d which
performed in Stan's on Wednes-
day, O c t o b e r 7, although J a z z
C l u b say this was n o l o u d e r
than usual.
D o n M u n r o has s a i d t h a t
complaints should not be taken
l i g h t l y as they p r e j u d i c e the
c h a n c e s o f g e t t i n g p l a n n i n g
p e r m i s s i o n for a f u r t h e r h a l l
next to Linstead. H e suggests
that serious thought should be
given to the staging of bands in
S t a n ' s , a n d t h e c o m p l a i n t s
procedure should be tightened
up.
It is understood that a couple
of years ago, the M a y f a i r Resi-
dents Association succeeded in
bringing a legal action against
the Dorchester B a l l r o o m which
resulted in its closure.
FRESHERS' BALLS UP
THE FRESHERS' Concert on Saturday, October 11, made a loss of approximately £500. The
maximum estimate of the audience was about forty, though the headline band, No Dice,
brought a guest list of twelve. Significantly more than half the IC students present at the gig
walked out after Nigel Mazlyn-Jones finished. Only nine people had paid their £2 to enter by
8:00pm. John Passmore, the man responsible, was In the Union Bar at the time. When asked
what could be done about the low attendance, he answered: "I don't know what to do ... I
think I'll resign".

D a v e G a y e r was triumphantly ratified as President,, as G u i l d s held
their Election U G M on Wednesday lunchtime. D a v e W o l l a r d was
also ratified as this year's H J T . These elections, for w h i c h both
candidates were unopposed were held due to both the President and
H J T failing last summer's exams. T h e r e was a good turn out a n d
business was quickly a n d efficiently until the time came for the
f o r m a l i t y o f the c a n d i d a t e s s p e e c h e s . A s t h i s p o i n t i n the
proceedings, half way through D a v e Gayer's speech, the lights went
out, air horns blasted, extinguishers sprayed in all directions, a n d a
p a r t y of R C S m e n , t r a i n e d at a secret c a m p somewhere near
Southside, burst in, to attempt to steal Spanner a n d Bolt. After a
few minutes chase they were repulsed and Spanner and Bolt were
e x t r a c t e d f r o m u n d e r a p i l e o f hefty G u i l d s m e n . W i t h o r d e r
restored, b o t h c a n d i d a t e s were d u l y ratified a n d everyone then
retired in t r i u m p h to the Queens.

decision to reduce the admis-

ditch attempt to boost the

consisting of £325 fee to N o
