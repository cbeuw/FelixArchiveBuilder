Bojo says
'Cough up!'
A t 11 o'clock on a cold Saturday
morning, four R C S clowns were
to be s e e n o u t s i d e H a r r o d s
forlornly shaking collecting tins
at passers-by. However, half an
hour later, the R C S Exec, a n d
C o . , in full r e g a l i a , c o m p l e t e
with J e z arrived, thus swelling
the numbers to at least twenty.
T h e n , the E x e c , h a v i n g brought
a box of eggs a n d two cans of
lemon-and-lime shaving cream
with them, battle c o m m e n c e d .
Tactics for the extraction of
money ranged from the mildly
abusive a p p r o a c h , i.e. " i f you've
got a H a r r o d s bag you must
have a lot of m o n e y " to the
c h a n c e for s h o p p e r s o f f s p r i n g
( o n r e c e p t i o n o f a s i z e a b l e
parental donation) to throw a
custard in Steve Tyson's face.
O n e Bill D u r o d i e proved parti-
c u l a r l y a d e p t at t h e f o r m e r
method — showing ability to
attack not only English shopers,
but also F r e n c h a n d G e r m a n
ones — m u c h to the amazement
of the surrounding members of
R C S .
T h e m a j o r p r o b l e m o f the
day was that nearly all of the
e n t r a n c e s a n d e x i t s w e r e
c l o s e l y g u a r d e d b y p e o p l e
collecting for ' M u l t i p l e Sclerosis'
w i t h the a d d e d a d v a n t a g e o f
badges a n d it seemed that the
average H a r r o d ' s shopper pre-
ferred to possess a little yellow
sticker than the chance to throw
custard pies in the faces of R C S
'clowns'.

Birdman flies in
I A N J O H N S O N , the b i r d m a n of
Life Sciences 2, was seen back at
College this week. H e has been
m o d e s t l y h i d i n g the f o u r t e e n

from the J C R d u r i n g the Life

necessitated a stay of six days in St

ICWA Quorate?
T h e I C W A President, S a n d r a
O ' S u l l i v a n , a g a i n r e f u s e d to
attend or delegate her vote at
M o n d a y ' s I C U C o u n c i l meeting.
M i s s O ' S u l l i v a n h a s s i n c e
resigned, throwing the question
of the relevance of I C W A as a
representation o f I C women's
v i e w s . S h e is, d e s p i t e h a v i n g
been I C W A President, a vocifer-
ous opponent of the association.
However, I C W A was discussed
at C o u n c i l in her absence. A n n e
E d m a n d s asked C o u n c i l to lower
the I C W A q u o r u m from 20% to
5%. (unlike an I C U U G M , an
I C W A meeting cannot proceed
until 20% of its membership - is
p r e s e n t ) . It was a g r e e d t h a t
C o u n c i l c a n n o t d o this, a n d
t h a t it m u s t be t a k e n to a n
U G M , where the bye-laws can
be changed. F i o n a Sinclair argued
tht I C W A must change. T h e
inquoracy she said was related to
the disenchantment of most m e m -
bers. Miss E d m a n d s replied that
within, a n d that actions such as
the President's resignation and
t h e m o v e m e n t o f the I C W A
L o u n g e seriously jeopardise its
future.
P e t e S t e v e n s , t h e U n i o n
Welfare Officer, agreed to take
the q u o r u m p r o b l e m to the next
I C U G M on behalf of I C W A .
