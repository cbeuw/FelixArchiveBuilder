ments were made for the booking
of rooms other than the Concert
H a l l , for the provision of food or
for the booking of a disco, hence
the final format was two bands

O n the night, the only member
of the U n i o n Executive to turn u p
was J o h n Passmore, who p a i d a
fleeting visit before going on to
R u t h H i l d e b r a n d ' s b i r t h d a y
party. T h e rest of the I C members
in the audience were either with
E N T S or fans of N i g e l M a z l y n -
Jones. T h i s suggests that either
the publicity was nowehere near
as extensive as it should have been
or that everyone had seen N o D i c e
before.

APPENDIX
A S W E L L as havine to suffer
initiations, D a v e W o o l l a r d , the
new G u i l d s H J T , felt slight pains
in his stomach. H e was admitted
to St S t e p h e n s H o s p i t a l o n
Wednesday night a n d his a p p e n -
dix was removed. D a v e hoped to
be back next week.
Fire Escape
Inverts
W o r k on the fire escape from the
new Islamic Society r o o m has
been stopped due to a n objection
from I C R a d i o . T h e original plan
was for Islamic Society to have a
fire escape through I C R a d i o ' s
Northside studio. Since I C R a d i o
have about four thousand pounds
worth of equipment in the studios,
they were understandably u n -
happy about allowing free access
to them. T h e new plan is for a fire
escape in the same place, but
opening only from the I C R a d i o
side. Islamic Society will have a
fire escape built via n u m b e r 8
Princes Gardens. I C R a d i o have
not yeat b e e n t o l d w h e n the
w o r k m e n will be m o v i n g in, and
as yet the r o o m in which the door
will be made is still being used as a
technical workshop. D a v e Fuller,
I C R a d i o Station M a n a g e r , said:
" I a m pleased that it poses no
further security risk, but I'm upset
at the loss of such a valuable work
a r e a " .
T h e first M e c h E n g Soc meeting
of the year was held on O c t o b e r
9. Its m a i n attraction was the
speaker, Prof E r i c Laithwaite,
this alone attracted a massive
turnout. In excess of 400 c r a m m e d
into M e c h E n g 220 to hear this
acknowledged expert expound
on gyroscopes.
T h e l e c t u r e b e g a n w i t h a
series o f a n e c d o t e s a b o u t his
early life. H i s manner belied a
clever control of the audience
a n d a n a b i l i t y to d e f t l y d e a l
w i t h the a t t e n t i o n s of p h o t o -
grapher C o l i n Palmer.
In quick succession he ques-
t i o n e d t h e use of v e c t o r s i n
dealing with such things as the
c o r i o l i s force a n d t o r q u e . H e
i l l u m i n a t e d w h a t c o u l d h a v e
b e e n o b s t r u s e w i t h a s t e a d y
stream of provoking, but h u m o r -
ous questions.
However, he was in his element
when talking about the properties
of gyroscopes. T h i s culminated
in h i m lifting easily a massive
spinning gyroscope that c o u l d
not be lifted when motionless.
T h e questions of weight loss he
raised were beyond the ken of
m a n y p r e s e n t b u t he j u s t l y
received prolonged applause.
T h e r e is a further c o m p l i c a -
tion, Greece does not recognise
the U K B S c degree. Students
c o m i n g here have to take a n
M S c to gain Greek recognition.
T h i s c o m p l e x i t y a p p e a r e d to
confuse P h i l C o l e , a prospective
External Affairs Officer ( G r a h a m
Greene opposes h i m at the next
U G M election) was obviously
bemused when asked: " F o r us
ignoramouses, what is a B S c ? "
It was also p o i n t e d out at
C o u n c i l that in view of the U n i o n s
imposition of discretionary fines
on overdue posters, it was o d d
that a U G M poster should be up
eleven days after the event.

will then lease to students. T h e

challenge if the landlord wishes
to i n c r e a s e the rent o r e v i c t .
T h e immediate cost was esti-
mated to be £ 9 5 which will be
