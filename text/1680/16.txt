BBC’s Blue Planet II –Anatural masterpiece showing
The return of Blue Planet to our screens was a landmark event, not only for television, but for our relationship to
the natural world as a whole. Through the course of seven episodes, David Attenborough’s intrepid team took us
through the splendour of the oceans, and what we’re doing to them.
“Blue Planet II
is a testament
to the tenacity
and ingenuity
of the BBC
teams”
T
he BBC’s nature
d o c u m e n t a r y
series Blue
Planet II comes
16 years after the orig-
inal ground-breaking
programme came to
our television screens.
Narrated by none
other than Sir David
Attenborough, scored
by the Academy Award
winning composer Hans
Zimmer, and using the
latest in camera technolo-
gy, such as suction-cupped
cameras mounted to the
backs of killer-whales,
Blue Planet II chronicles
the untold stories of our
ocean’s creatures like
never before.
To reveal the lives of
these sub-aquatic animals
over seven episodes, the
Blue Planet II teams spent
five years researching
and filming for the series.
This amounted to 125 ex-
peditions in 39 countries
and over 6,000 hours of
footage: a testament to the
BBC teams’ tenacity and
ingenuity.
Attenborough’s nar-
ration is colourful and
heart-warming, with the
camera-work nothing
short of a visual marvel.
Hans Zimmer’s mastery
of music is the perfect
accompaniment to the
visuals, as though each
note was composed,
bespoke, for each frame.
This all culminates into
a treat for the eyes, ears,
and soul.
The nature documen-
tary series has received a
reception akin to that of a
Hollywood blockbuster:
the first episode was the
most streamed program on
BBC iPlayer in 2017, with
over 4.2 million views to
date. Discoveries previ-
ously unknown to science,
events never before
captured on camera, and
a vivid message about our
own impact on the oceans
that may well change the
way people and govern-
ments think about the
seas: these are a few of
the achievements of Blue
Planet II thus far.
Episode one: One
Ocean – Clever fish
In the first episode,
we meet a remarkable
little fish that challenges
our understanding of fish
intelligence. The tusk
fish is named after the six
chaotic teeth it uses to grip
onto hard-shelled clams.
It takes a single clam to
a special coral, where it
then proceeds to whack
it against a protruding,
anvil-like rock. After
more than fifty hits, the
determined fish eventual-
ly breaks through to the
meat, claiming its reward.
That fish can have the
ability to use tools was a
remarkable discovery for
the filming team. In the
final episode, we learn
that this particular fish
was given the name Percy,
the persistent. We meet
Alex, the cameraman who
had been diving in these
waters since he was five
and had filmed Percy. He
describes the utter devas-
tation caused by the coral
bleaching events that took
place during the time of
filming: Percy’s coral
kitchen, once vibrant and
colourful, turns a skeletal
white, creating a lump at
the back of our throats.
Episode two: The
Deep – Sinking into
the darkness of an al-
ien world
The second episode
takes us to a place we
know less about than the
surface of the moon: our
deep oceans. We voyage
to deep sea brine lakes,
where an eel spasms out
of control as it is poisoned
by the harsh conditions,
and to the Mariana
Trench, deep enough to
swallow Mount Everest
and where life on Earth
may have begun.
The sequence follow-
ing a 30-tonne whale
carcass sinking from the
surface to the sea floor
was the most memorable.
The whale creates a
culinary bonanza for the
creatures of the deep. The
audience’s jaws drop as
six-gill sharks come from
far and wide, eventually
covering the body of the
whale, ravenously tearing
off chunks of flesh to
satiate their appetites
that have developed after
nearly a year of fasting.
Crabs and other scav-
engers clear the carcass
leaving nothing but bone
after 3 months. This bone
is eventually consumed
as well, finishing off the
circular recycling process.
Episode three: Coral
Reefs – Chaos in coral
cathedrals
Coral occupies less than
one-tenth of one percent
of the ocean floor, yet is
home to a quarter of all
marine species. We saw
scenes of octopus teaming
up with grouper, using
signals to communicate
with each other to catch a
meal, as well as cuttlefish
mesmerising their prey
with their iridescent glow
before dispatching it.
The most unforgettable
moment comes when, on
one of the most remote
and pristine reefs in the
world, huge grouper come
together in their thousands
to spawn. The thrilling
sequence shows the
animals racing towards
each other to fertilise
eggs that would produce
the next generation. In
the mating commotion,
however, sharks took ad-
vantage of the distracted
fish, and picked off lovers
one-by-one.
Episode four: Big
Bang – Nowhere to
hide
Detailing the de-
sert-like vastness of the
open ocean, this episode’s
most remarkable story
was one once confined to
the legend of ‘the boiling
sea’.
Inaremotecornerofthe
Pacific Ocean, we witness
a feast of gargantuan
proportions. Amongst the
hundreds of diners were
spinner dolphins, aptly
named for their sponta-
neous aerial pirouettes
they do mid-swim; tuna
who trail-blazed a way to
the action at 40 miles an
hour; mobula rays with
two-meter wingspans
and gaping wide mouths;
and sail-fish, amongst
the fastest fish in the sea.
They swarmed around
a massive shoal of tiny
lantern fish who had
nowhere to hide.
Debunking the myth,
the aerial camera shot
shows the sea frothing
like boiling water in the
middle of the otherwise
featureless ocean from
the commotion caused by
the feeding frenzy. The
onslaught lasted less than
15 minutes but decimated
the shoal of fish, leaving
behind nothing but silvery
scales, falling like snow
into the ocean’s depths.
A fisherman’s tale,
it’s easy to imagine how
sea-men of the past, who
witnessed this event, may
have mistaken the sea
to be boiling as bubbles

featureless blueness.
Episode five: Green
Seas – Most life lives
where it’s green, not
blue
A common octopus
off the coast of South
Africa stole the show in
this episode, dazzling
scientists in the process.
Living in kelp forests,
with over 100 species of
shark who have octopus
on their menu, it must
make a living hiding in
nooks and crannies and
ambushing unsuspecting
crabs. A pyjama shark
however, named for its
skin, which looks like
striped PJs, squeezes
into the octopus’ hiding
crevice and in a flurry of
movement catches it in
its jaws. It all seems over
but the clever mollusc
sticks its tentacles into the
shark’s gills, choking it,
and so forcing it to let go.
Its name perhaps
doesn’t do this remarka-
bly clever animal justice.
The octopus, now in the
open, attaches shells and
debris to the suckers of its
tentacles, protecting itself
in armour and hiding in
plain sight, thus confusing
the shark, allowing it to
balls were once hunted to
the brink of extinction for
their coats, but have now
made a recovery thanks to
remarkable conservation
efforts. We are treated to
cuteness that would rival
any YouTube cat video
as a mother preens and
conditions its tiny pup’s
coat to fluff it up, making
it buoyant, allowing it
to float in the sea! The
sea otter’s recovery had
secondary effects, main-
taining the health of kelp
forests which play an
important part in trapping
carbon dioxide, counter-
ing climate change.
Episode six: Coasts
– Animals run the
gauntlet from land to
sea
We follow a group of
bachelor Galapagos sea
lions hunting tuna. The
60-kilogram fish would
be much too fast for the
marine mammals in an
open-sea race and so, to
catch their prey, the sea
lions employ their wit and
cunning: they drive a few
tuna into a shallow, rocky
cove by the coast where
there is a greater chance
for them to land a catch.
Initially, one male
attempts this alone to no
avail, as the slick tuna
give him the slip. He
then comes back with
reinforcements. Multiple
sea lions, with a strategy
to rival an NFL side, all
take up their roles for
the hunt. Some drive the
tuna into the coves whilst
others wait at the entrance
to prevent their escape.
The stunning drone
footage captures the
sequence in the crys-
tal-clear waters and leaves
the audience mesmerised,
waiting with bated breath
to see whether the band of
brothers are triumphant.
They are, and at the end
you see the efforts and
time that went into pro-
ducing the seven minute
scene.
Episode seven: Our
Blue Planet – The
problems that we cre-
ate and only we can
solve
The final episode
sheds light on the extent
to which humans are
degrading the seas and
threatening the existence
of the creatures who
dwell within them, which
have delighted us over
the previous episodes.
Throughout the series,
there were hints at the
extent to which humanity
was degrading our blue
planet, but in the finale
this inconvenient reality
is laid bare. The viewer
is forced to pause for
introspection because, in
reality, there is no planet
II. Although casting a
sombre tone, its overall
message is one of hope,
as we meet the incredible
people dedicating their
lives to safeguarding the
seas and its wonders.
We meet Len, from
Trinidad and Tobago, who
was met with resistance,
aggression, and threats
to his safety when he
first started protecting his
island’s leatherback sea
turtles after realising there
was an imminent risk of
extinction if nothing was
done to protect them.
These giants, weighing
nearly half a tonne, came
to the shores to lay their
ping-pong-ball-sized
eggs, during which time
they were defenceless and
were commonly killed for
their meat.
Poachers who once
hunted them, however,
now play an integral part
in their conservation.
Children are taught about
their natural heritage
in school, and the local
economy is also bene-
fiting, as tourist flock to
catch a glimpse of these
ocean behemoths. Len
and his team’s tireless
efforts now mean that the
beaches of Trinidad and
Tobago are home to the
best populations of leath-
erbacks in the world!
Perhaps the most perti-
nent message put to us all
relates to our infatuation
with plastics, especially
those of the ‘disposable’
and the ‘convenient’ type.
Eight million tonnes of
the stuff find its way into
our oceans each year,
wreaking havoc on marine
life in even the remotest
four after its milk had
been laced with environ-
mental plastic molecules
was a troubling reminder
of our need to reassess our
relationship with plastic.
The episode and series
as a whole gave us a
number of bitter pills to
swallow. David Attenbor-
ough, however, is perhaps
the only person able to
make a nation, and maybe
planet, take it.
§
Of all the stars in the
show, the most remarkable
was one of our own: Sir
David Attenborough. He
held our attention and awe
throughout each episode,
and in the finale, like a
benevolent grandparent,
he held our hand whilst
gently delivering the
message that we had to be
more careful and take care
of the world we live in.
It had to be him though.
Were it anyone else, we
would have no doubt
snatched away our hand
like an infant throwing
a tantrum. His oratory
genius, authentic delivery,
and ability to remove any
scientific distance from
the audience, left us with
a sense of optimism and
encouragement, rather
than one of sorrow and
despair.
Sir David provided
a rejuvenation for the
human spirit. At the age
of 91, he still displays the
fascination and curiosity
of a child, still marvelling
at the creatures he has
spent his life document-
ing. However, he also
provides us all with sage
wisdom. In his final
monologue, he states:
“Never before have we
had such an awareness of
what we are doing to the
planet and never before
have we had the power
to do something about
that. Surely, we have a re-
sponsibility to care for our
blue planet. The future of
humanity and indeed all
life on Earth now depends
on us”.
Rather than being com-
plicit in its destruction,
maybe we can now be part
of the ocean’s salvation?
