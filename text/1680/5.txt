Does the future of organ transplant lie in bioprinting?
Developments in 3D printing may lead to a world where we’re able to print new organs, but not everyone is
convinced that this technology will solve current waiting times.

N
othing could
be more pain-
ful for patients
and their
families than waiting for
an organ to save their life.
According to latest NHS
figures, the average wait
time for a kidney trans-
plant is 944 days – despite
a significant decrease
from 1,153 days previous-
ly, two and a half years
is a long time to wait.
To make matters worse,
during this period families
suffer from heavy finan-
cial turmoil, with medical
conditions leading to the
potential loss of income.
This can be disastrous if
the patient-in-waiting is
the primary earner of the
family.
However, long waiting
times are not the only
complication involved
with an organ transplant.
According to NHS sta-
tistics, there is a huge
disparity in supply and
demand, with just 2,456
organ donors compared to
6,388 patients requesting
transplants in 2016/17.
The situation becomes
more complex as an organ
transplant is, in and of
itself, non-trivial: organ
donations require immu-
nocompatibility between
donors and recipients,
similar to blood transfu-
sions, where criteria such
as blood group and Rh
status also need to be met.
Moreover, the patients
may fall victim to infec-
tions due to the immuno-
suppressants administered
during transplantation.
Alternatively, they might
develop undiagnosed
medical conditions such
as HIV, Hepatitis B, or
cancer from the donors
themselves. Currently,
organ supply is filled
with altruistic donations,
but there is also a black
market for organs; though
illegal and unethical, this
industry is very much
present, especially in de-
veloping countries such as
India, China, and Nepal.
Recent developments
in medical science could
tackle these issues with
one example being
additive manufacturing
– commonly known as
3D printing – which may
allow for bioprinting
of organs! Through
this process, an organ
can be designed using
a modelling software,
and then printed with
biomaterials such as
polymers and hydrogels,
in addition to the patient’s
own cells. 3D-printed
organs, if successfully
produced, could tackle
“While the use
of 3D printing
is ambitious,
it could be a
revolutionary
change for
healthcare”
“While there
are ethical
concerns,
others are
worried about
an economic
divide”
the big three obstacles in
organ transplants: patient
wait time, financial and
emotional distress, and
immunological failure.
Currently, 3D bioprinting
has a significant presence
in customized implants,
prosthetics, and working
models for simulating the
effect of drug treatments
outside the human body.
While the use of 3D
printing to eliminate the
crushing deficit of organ
supply is ambitious, it
could be a revolutionary
change for the healthcare
industry – extending
people’s lives, as well as
their productivity.
Experts in this field,
however, have issued
caution against keeping
hopes too high. Jennifer
Lewis, a bioengineer at
Harvard University, is
positive about the devel-
opments but suggests that
the complicated archi-
tecture of organs such as
livers and kidneys means
bioprinting is unlikely
to be plausible solution
in the immediate future.
Another expert in 3D
bioprinting, Dr. Anthony
Atala, director of theWake
Forest Institute for regen-
erative medicine, has a
more positive outlook:
he has successfully led a
project to grow a human
bladder using bioprinting
and transplanted it to
seven young patients suf-
fering from spina bifida,
a condition which can
cause bladder problems.
He has also set his eyes
on bioprinting kidneys
– one of the organs most
commonly in demand. In a
seminal TED talk in 2011,
he displayed a kidney
which had been printed
on a machine earlier that
day. But while the talk
was a smashing success
it also invited heavy
criticism: the kidney was
an artificial model and not
functional, and he was
accused of misleading the
audience. According to
Lewis, though the science
is progressing in the right
direction, it is still a long
way from providing real
assurances to patients in
need.
At present, many
scientists are debating
the actual potential of 3D
bioprinting however, with
a number of companies
trying to make it commer-
cially viable. Cellink, a
Swedish based company
founded last year,
develops new biomaterial
as “ink” for 3D bioprint-
ers. With customers in 25
countries across the world
– including researchers
at MIT, Harvard, and
University College
London – its success story
explains the fact that they
have enlisted for an Initial
Public Offering (IPO),
becomingapubliclytraded
company just ten months
after being founded. It’s a
noteworthy achievement,
which exemplifies the
market potential of organ
bio-printing. Organovo is
a much older name in this
field. They state their goal
is “to build living human
tissues that are proven
to function like native
tissues, with reproducible
3D tissues that accurately
represent human biology”.
While their current
products revolve mostly
around providing in vitro
tissue models for drug
testing, they are actively
investing in developing
artificial organs ready for
transplant. Furthermore,
this field appears to be
extremely lucrative, with
a report suggesting that
3D printing has a potential
of being an “$8.9 billion
industry, with $1.9 billion
(21%) projected to be
spent on medical applica-
tions”.
Some critics, however,
have their own opinions
about the entire matter.
While there are religious
and ethical concerns over
‘man playing god’ by
creating artificial tissues,
there are also concerns
about how this could
create another divide
between rich and poor.
Furthermore, the caution
raised by Jennifer Lewis
against “false hope”
remains: patients may
currently be waiting years
to get an organ, but these
technologies may take
another decade to develop
and be approved.
Hope and uncertainty
are two sides to the
same coin. Though we
would not witness the
results of these efforts
tomorrow, the day after
tomorrow may be better
and brighter! The world
of medicine has promised
many cures in the past, but
not all of them become
successful, and despite
being scientifically
approved, it takes a long
journey for any treatment
to become an acceptable
‘cure’. The same goes for
organ bio-printing: it is the
interplay between techno-
logical innovation, social
acceptance, religious
beliefs, and legislative
framework that will even-
tually shape the future of
organ bioprinting in our
daily lives.

Connect with conservation: oceanic ghostbusters
SCIENCE

I
am sure that many
of you have been
moved by the recent
sequences in Blue
Planet II highlighting
the devastating effects
that plastic is having in
our oceans. Although
the production team
removed all the plastic
they came across, this
pales in comparison to
the amount that actually
ends up in our oceans
each year. One of the
most devastating pieces
of plastic waste that
enters our ocean eco-
systems are ghost nets.
These are fishing nets
that have unfortunately
been lost, or accidentally
left in the ocean by
fishermen. They drift
through the ocean, or
stay anchored in place,
where they entangle
unsuspecting marine ani-
mals such as dolphins, sea
turtles and sharks which
drown when trapped.
This is where ‘Net-
Works’ comes in: it is
of material that would
benefit communities, as
well as the environment.
At the same time, ZSLwas
in process of developing
a new model of commu-
nity-based conservation.
Coupled together, this
cultivated in Net-Works,
which seeks to empower
people in coastal commu-
nities in the developing
world by the collection
and wholesale selling of
lost or discarded nylon
fishing nets. The primary
focus is to remove the nets
from the ocean, thereafter
helping local communities
raise money to increase
their standard of living.
The nets gathered are
eventually recycled into
yarn to make carpet tile,
after entering the global
supply chain.
Adding to the issue is
the fact that we currently
live in a throwaway
culture, and unfortunately
not everyone has the
means to recycle their
waste. Moreover, not all
plastic can be recycled,
so alternative uses for the
waste has to be found.
This can only occur
through innovations and
outside-the-box thinking,
as demonstrated through
Net-Works. You can help
too by cutting down on
the amount of plastic you
use, and doing more to
recycle.
Since the start of the
unlikely partnership, over
142 metric tons of waste
nets have been removed
from the oceans through
Net-Works. Currently, the
program only operates
in Cameroon and the
Philippines, but there are
ambitions to push things
even further and scale
up. This could very well
be the starting point of
the removal of billions
of tons of plastic waste
currently found in our
oceans!
