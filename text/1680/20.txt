Universities given same legal status as prisons in
cabinet shake-up
HANGMAN
Imperial has already
begun making
changes to services,
reducing food
options, scrapping
extracurriculars, and
infringing on human
rights.

T
heresa May this
week combined
several cabinet
roles, meaning
universities will legally
have the same status as
prisons.
In a bold move, the
former Prisons Minis-
ter, Sam Johnson, will
now become ‘Minister
for Large, Faceless
Institutions (Prisons and
Universities)’, as part
of May’s recent cabinet
shake-up. New legislation
will come into force at the
end of the academic year,
meaning higher education
institutions will officially
have the same legal status
as correctional facilities.
In a statement issued by
the government, Johnson
said that he was “well pre-
pared” for the role, citing
his experience as Prisons
Minister, a position he has
held since 2013: “over the
past four years, I have had
a great deal of experience
managing large numbers
of very unhappy people
who are unable to mingle
with civil society, and are
forced into close proximi-
ty with one another under
duress. This makes me
perfectly suited to taking
on the unique challenge of
our university system.”
While the new legis-
lation will not come into
effect until July, Imperial
this week began imme-
diately making changes
representative told Felix,
“but moving forward we
need to ensure that we
remain a key player in the
burgeoning prison-univer-
sity-industrial complex.”
A number of changes
have already been noticed
around campus: food
options have been dra-
matically reduced across
Imperial-run outlets, with
students using the QTR
now being offered the
option of “prison loaf”
and “prison loaf (vegan)”.
Felix have heard rumours
that Fusion leftovers are
used to make the loaf,
but the College refused to
confirm or deny this. One
PhD student we spoke
to seemed unaffected by
the changes, telling us
“ever since they removed
cooked breakfasts from
the SCR all food is like
mere ash in my mouth.”
Further changes to the
student experience are ex-
pected to be coming soon.
Felix spoke to Michael
Mitchell, the newly-ap-
pointed Vice Provost
(Solitary Confinement),
Students/inmates in their new‘isolation pods’// Thomas Angus/Imperial
converting Queen’s Lawn
into an exercise yard.
Mitchell believed that
students would welcome
the change, citing the
establishment of a police
state at Imperial last term
(as reported in Hangman
Issue 10).
Mitchell said: “by
reducing available ex-
tracurricular activities,
difficult decisions about
what to eat, and distract-
ing thoughts about human
liberties, our students
will be better equipped to
focus on their studies.”
The College is cur-
rently trialling periods
of incarceration for
students: last week saw a
72-hour lock-in occuring
in Central Library, during
which students were not
allowed to leave, and were
forced to sleep at their
desks. Nobody noticed.
“The QTR
is now only
offering the
options‘prison
loaf’and
‘prison loaf
(vegan)’”
in anticipation: “For the
past century Imperial has
been a world-renowned
centre for sector-leading
research,” a College
“College have
said that
students will
work harder,
now they are
not distracted
by human
rights”
who said the College
was in discussions with
Sport Imperial about

This week you’re the
Felix Editor, and you
make a triumphant return
to the office. Your team
are mostly just upset they
can’t use it as a private
study space anymore.

Scheduling January
exams has meant
students are finding
it impossible to start
2018 with positivity.

A
c o l l e c t i v e
of Imperial
students are
launching a
class action legal case
against the College for
“sabotaging our New
Year’s Resolutions”.
The group, which
numbers around 30 un-
dergraduate students from
a range of departments,
have accused the College
of “gross negligence” in
failing to create an envi-
ronment where they can
follow their 2018 mantra
of ‘new year, new me’.
Josh Pilkinton, a third-
year physics student, out-
lined the main grievances
the group has with the
College: “I was all ready
to come back into the
new year with a healthy
outlook on life,” Pilkinton
told Felix, “I know I said
this last year, and the year
before that, but 2018 was
going to be my year. I was
going to actually be on
top of my workload, and
get to bed at a reasonable
time, but now College has
made it impossible.”
“For starters, they’re
going to be getting rid
of the swimming pool
in Paddington. I haven’t
been swimming for the
last five years (unless you
count that incident on
the AMS tour to Buda-
pest when I fell into the
Danube), but I had really
good intentions to do
more exercise this year,
and now they’ve been
crushed before I could put
them into action. I tried
to go to Ethos last week,
but it’s even more packed
than usual – if I wanted
to spend hours tightly
packed in with a bunch of
sweaty strangers I’d just
get on the Central Line.”
Other students taking
legal action complained
about the number of
January exams they had.
“My new year’s resolution
was to be more positive”,
one biology student told
Felix, “but with the exam
stress I’ve spent the last
week being an absolutely
awful person. I’m hateful,
full of vitriol, and yester-
day I pushed an old lady
down the stairs, just to
feel something.”
College is not the only
group facing criticism:
the Union’s decision to
reinstate Stella 4 has also
come under fire from the
group. “The only thing
getting me through dry
January was the idea that
all I’d have to drink was
the watery piss they call
Bud Light,” Caleb Gol-
ightly, a chemistry fresher,
told Felix, “but now Stella
is back, my commitment
to sobriety is fucked.”
Students sue Imperial for making ‘new year, new me’
impossible
This week you decide
to emulate Toby Young,
and bring his trademark
“caustic wit” to your
coursemates. You have no
friends.
This week you’re the
cabinet reshuffle, and
you’re really just a
huge disappointment
for everyone involved.
You’re bad and you
should feel bad.
This week you really
misinterpret the cashless
paying system. College
Cafe don’t accept cheques
apparently.
This week you’re hyped
about the return of Stella
4 to the Union bars.
Mainly because it gives
you an excuse to use the
word ‘Stellabration’ in
conversation.
This week your new year
diet goes off the rails
when you keep buying
discounted brandy butter
to spread on your toast.
This week your new
year’s resolution to be a
better person goes out the
window when you realise
you’re fundamentally a
human piece of garbage.
This week you thought
for a hot second that it
might be nice to come
back to Imperial after
the break. Oh, we’ve got
news for you.
This week you have
to put into practice
convoluted lies about
what you were doing
on New Year’s Eve.
We know you were at
home alone, crying over
your fluid dynamics
coursework. Just admit it.
This week you’re 2017,
and, quite frankly, you’re
upset about how many
people seem to have
forgotten about you so
quickly. You weren’t that
bad.
This week you return to
your student flat after
three weeks away, only
to find your housemates
have changed the locks.
Great joke guys, but
you can let me in now.
Guys… GUYS?!
This week you’re
celebrating the return of
Central Library. Finally
you’ve got somewhere to
watch your YouTube Vine
compilations in peace.
