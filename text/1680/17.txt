W
ho doesn’t
like to
travel? It’s
e x c i t i n g ,
adventurous, and a great
way to discover new
cultures. But sometimes,
due to time or price
constraints, that’s not
an option. In that case,
why not take a holiday
in our own motherland,
the United Kingdom? It
has many fantastic travel
options that we tend to
overlook, so today I’m
here to show you some
of England’s hidden
treasures.
Bristol
Bristol is one of those
cities anyone will tell
you is inherently cool.
And, long story short,
they’re not wrong. I go
there at least once a year,
and I know I can always
expect some relaxing,
fun, hipster vibes, which
is a nice change from the
posh hustle and bustle
in South Ken. It’s ideal
for a weekend escape
from the city, leaving on
a Friday afternoon and
coming back on Sunday,
well-rested and ready for
more Imperial deadlines.
But how do you fill that
magical weekend?
Let’s start with
Gloucester Street, one of
the coolest, hippest streets
I’ve been to. Reminiscent
of London’s Shoreditch
but much cheaper, it’s
filled with independent
restaurants and thrift
stores, where you can get
the cheapest and jazziest
clothes. My personal
favourite is the Cats
Protection store, where
all sales go to aiding cat
welfare (I bought an acid
washed denim shirt and
helped animals all in one
– you can’t ask for more).
There’s also a giant ware-
house/thrift store at the
end of the street, which
is perfect for old records
and discarded mannequin
parts if that’s what you’re
into.
For lunch, St. Nicholas
Market is just five minutes
away and offers a wide
variety of food stalls,
ranging from sausages to
Korean food. Admittedly,
some of them are not the
cheapest, but if you live
in London you’re used to
it. Portions are quite large
though, so if you’re smart
and can control your
appetite, you might have
dinner sorted too.
As a student, you’re
probably also wondering
about Bristol’s nightlife,
and – #spoileralert – it
doesn’t disappoint. Start
with some cocktails at
Flipside, with their 2-for-1
days, secret garden, and
pun-tastic drinks (“Gin ne
sais quoi” is genius). Or if
you’re feeling fancy, Her
Majesty’s Secret Service
is a cocktail bar whose
entrance is disguised
within a red telephone
booth. That says it all.
Once you’re feeling
‘happy’, there are plenty
of clubs you can check
out: SWX is a student-fa-
vourite, which boasts
three different music
rooms and spacious dance
floors, so you can get as
crazy with your dance
moves as you want.
This brings me to my
favourite topic: sleep. In
terms of accommoda-
tion, they do have fancy
hotels, like the Marriott
and Hilton, and I’m sure
there are many Airbnb’s
available. But I recom-
mend getting a friend who
studies at Bristol Univer-
sity and will let you sleep
in their house for free.
Plus, they’ll know the
ins and outs of the city
and can take you to cool
places.
If you do go to Bristol,
you must visit the Clifton
Suspension Bridge. It’s
the Bristolians’ proud
badge of honour, and
deservedly so. Situated in
the middle of a valley, this
giant bridge is an image
taken straight out of a
travel brochure, which
will leave you wide-eyed
in wonder. There’s a beau-
tiful hill right beside it
which proves a nice hike
and provides a spectacular
view of the bridge. You
can walk across the bridge
during the day and enjoy
the view of the river and
the valley, or go there at
night when it’s beautifully
illuminated and you can
see all the lights from the
city below (peaceful af).
But Bristol’s charm
does not lie only in these
great locations. The city

Sick of London? Three of England’s gems for a quick
weekend getaway
“Situated in

itself is an attraction. Just
walk around its streets,
browse some shops, and
enjoy its casual atmos-
phere. Everyone there
seems happy and light,
which is very contagious.
Stop at any of its great
cafes, like the Boston Tea
Company, and enjoy a
hot drink and a delicious
scone (or your sweet treat
of choice).
In short, go to Bristol
for a fun, carefree
weekend, filled with fun
and denim jackets.
Surrey
Surrey, and its main city
Guildford, are great for a
short day trip and pretend-
ing you’re from the rich
part of England. It’s super
easy to get there: you can
take a train from Waterloo
for less than £8 and be
there in half an hour. It’s
the perfect distance: it
doesn’t take ages to travel
there but still feels far
enough that your worries
won’t matter.
I recommend getting
there around midday,
since there’s no rush.
The station is right next
to the main city area, so
you can literally get off
the train and straight into
the city. There are three
main streets, all lined with
any shop you can think
of, so be ready to browse
some clothes or books
and comment on how bad
inflation is getting. It’s
also very easy to find a
beautiful scenery and
fresh air (which is ironic
because it used to be the
UK’s industrial centre).
Since it’s so far away, you
should probably compare
train and plane tickets to
see which is cheaper for
your preferred date. In
my case, I bought train
tickets about a month in
advance and spent around
£80 (which is slightly
expensive but sometimes
you need to treat yo’ self).
Once you’re there, get
ready to enjoy the city’s
open spaces and impres-
sive architecture. And I
mean impressive. Every
single building is excel-
lently conserved, and
some look like Gringotts
Wizarding Bank itself.
Speaking of architecture,
they are also particularly
proud of their bridges, of
which there are seven:
some of them are true ar-
chitectural feats spanning
the River Tyne. They’re
similar to the Thames’
multiple bridges, each
different and special in its
Instagram aficionados, it
has a fifth floor viewing
area where you can see
the entire city beneath
you, with the river and its
many bridges on the side.
I obviously took several
pictures.
Surrey is for the ones craving a quieter weekend break // Daniel Corredera Nadal
nice place to eat, although
it might be hard to decide
since they all look so good.
I went to this lovely pub in
the town centre with great
pigeon decorations and
nice vegan burgers – what
more do you want?
If you have the time
and are not fed up of uni-
versities, go have a look at
the University of Surrey.
It has a completely dif-
ferent vibe from Imperial
(people are not running
aroundstressedoutoftheir
minds and crippled by the
weight of their deadlines),
which is interesting to see.
They even have a park on
campus with a beautiful
lake and benches to sit
on and think about life.
Here’s some Surrey inside
knowledge and a possible
spoiler alert: the lake is
actually fake, built based
on a CivEng students’
project. You won’t be able
to tell from how realistic
and peaceful it seems. Oh,
and the ducks are just as
nice as in Hyde Park.
Do you want to take
a casual stroll around a
quaint little town on a
sunny day, or at least as
sunny as England allows?
Then Surrey is perfect
for you (you’ll thank me
later).
Newcastle upon Tyne

entry. Friday nights are
filled with uni students, so
there’s a great atmosphere
and plenty of people to
dance with. There are also
plenty of food places open
late at night right next to
the clubs if you’re feeling
hungry at 4am after
partying.
For a chill hangover
day, why not walk around
the main street, filled with
shops and restaurants
which are fun to browse. I
went in December so I’m
biased, but the light deco-
rations and the Christmas
market made it very jolly
and inviting. Five minutes
away is the beautiful
Sunday market, which
has dozens of little stands
selling very interesting
objects. I particularly
remember a shop selling
wooden plaques, each
fashioned after a different
dog breed. Its privileged
position right next to
the river bed makes it a
splendid place for a walk.
It’s also right next to the
Baltic Centre for Con-
temporary Art, a beautiful
modern art museum for
the artists amongst you. It
has some very interesting
exhibitions, quite similar
to the Tate Modern but far
less crowded. And for the

own right.
One of the best things
about Newcastle is its
nightlife. There are a
bunch of clubs: Tiger
Tiger, Illegitimate, and my
personal favourite Soho
Rooms, which is free
Final word of advice:
it’s freezing. They don’t
have London’s warming
and protective smog, so
bring a good coat. But on
the upside, it also means
the chance of snow is very
high, so you might be
lucky enough (as I was)
to see snow carpeting the
city.
Have I convinced you to
spend your next weekend
in the UK rather than
travelling abroad? I sure
hope so, I didn’t write this
article for nothing, and the
UK’s tourism office wants
its money’s worth.
