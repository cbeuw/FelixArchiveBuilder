Money can’t buy you everything…
A
ny opinion of
Ridley Scott’s
latest film, All
the Money in
the World, is going to be
indelibly coloured by the
situation surrounding its
production. Scheduled to
be released in the States at
the end of last year, with
Kevin Spacey in the lead,
the film seemed doomed
following the numerous
sexual assault accusations
against Spacey that had
emerged. Instead of can-
ning the project, however,
Scott decided to reshoot
Spacey’s scenes, having
Christopher Plummer play
the tight-fisted billionaire
J.P. Getty instead. It was
an audacious move, one
that only the most dedi-
cated director could pull
off; Scott proves himself
to be meticulously organ-
ised, or slightly insane, or
perhaps both. The release
date was only delayed by
three days.
A momentous under-
taking, perhaps, but it also
makes it a difficult film
to review – any positive
aspects are bound to be
taken out of proportion,
while faults can be
excused as a result of
the extensive reshoots.
Ultimately, however, the
circumstances of the pro-
duction will go down as
the most interesting aspect
of the film: All the Money
is a technically-competent
but stolid drama, which
leaves little impression
once the credits have
rolled.
Taking as its source
material Painfully Rich:
The Outrageous Fortunes
and Misfortunes of the
Heirs of J. Paul Getty by
John Pearson, who is no
stranger to salubrious bi-
ographies, All the Money
centres on the kidnapping
of J.P Getty’s grandson,
Paul (Charlie Plummer),
by Italian Mafiosi. After
the initial kidnapping, we
are treated to about thirty
minutes of explanatory
footage, which estab-
lishes how Getty became
rich (oil), his parenting
style (distant), and his
spending habits (frugal).
This section, which darts
across countries and time
zones with such speed it’s
dizzying, seems largely
unnecessary, particularly
when the film’s runtime
means it begins to drag
during the second half.
Once we get back
into the meat of the film,
we manage to fall into
a steady rhythm. The
beating heart of the plot is
Paul’s mother, Gail Harris
(Michelle Williams), who
married into the Getty
family before divorcing
her husband after he
becomes addicted to
drugs. She’s fighting
a battle on three sides:
trying to convince her
son’s kidnappers that she
doesn’t have the money
they’re after, whilst simul-
taneously dealing with
the Italian police and her
ex-father-in-law. She’s
facing an uphill struggle
to have Getty pay the
ransom fund: he refuses
to hand over the money,
initially because he is
convinced by his advisor
Fletcher Chase (Mark
Wahlberg) that the kid-
napping has been staged.
Even when it all turns out
to be gruesomely true, he
balks at giving away any
more than the maximum
tax-deductible amount.
Any concerns that
Plummer’s rapid addition
may come across in his
acting are unfounded:
he inhabits the juicy role
of Getty with aplomb,
savouring his lines like
luxurious morsels, and
managing to captivate in
all his scenes. He portrays
Getty as a ruthless
tyrant, resplendent in his
moral iniquity, allowing
us to largely (but not
completely) banish
Spacey’s spectre from the
screen. He is matched by
Williams, who – despite
being burdened with an
unfortunate wig – delivers
her lines with a Katharine
Hepburn-esque gravitas.
She shows the horrific
situation Gail is put in
pitch-perfectly, moving
from outrage to sorrow
over the span of a couple
of lines. Wahlberg, on the
other hand, seems slightly
miscast: his Chase lacks
the high drama of his co-
leads’characters, and he is
never able to lose himself
within his role entirely.
With his usual eye
for visual style, Scott is
brilliant at portraying the
franticism of Rome during
the 1960s and ‘70s, all
paparazzi on vespas, wide
lapels, and classic cars.
Scott moves his camera
through interior locations
with grace, ensuring that
the audience takes in every
aspect of the space, often
framed with shafts of soft
light filtering in. All the
Money in the World is an
incredibly textural film,
a facet reflected in Janty
Yates’ beautiful costume
design, which Scott high-
lights throughout.
Where All the Money
in the World really falls
down, however, is when
it is deciding what sort of
film it wants to be. While
the first thirty minutes
resemble a family drama,
for the remainder Scott
seems to veer between
thriller, romance, and
procedural drama. It’s not
helped by the creative lib-
erties Scott took with the
source material, tacking
on extra sequences which
come across as redundant,
adding little other than
bolstering an already-long
runtime. Scott switches
lanes frequently, never
leaving us with enough
time to enjoy the action
playing out in front of
us. The film leaves us
with more questions than
answers, mainly about
why such a film needed to
be made, or what sort of
point it’s making. While
there are the beginnings
of several great films
in All the Money, the
leads simply trail out.
Scott should have learnt
some lessons from Getty
himself: if you try and
have everything, you’ll
just end up with nothing
at all.
Ridley Scott’s All the Money in the World tries to take on too much, and the result is a film that lacks focus.

or some people,
January may
bring thoughts of
new year’s reso-
lutions, gym sessions, and
anxiously awaiting the sun
to return. For cinephiles,
however, it marks the
true beginning of awards
season: the Oscar nomi-
nations will be announced
at the end of this month,
and before those are given
out we have the BAFTAs
to look forward to, as well
as the fallout from last
week’s Golden Globes
awards. We get our films
a little bit later than in the
States, which means that
from January studios will
start putting out their big
hitters. Here are five of
our favourites:
Three Billboards Out-
side Ebbing, Missouri
Frances McDormand
is garnering high levels
of Oscar buzz for her
leading role in Martin
McDonagh’s Three Bill-
boards Outside Ebbing,
Missouri, a dark comedy
set in a small town in the
American Midwest. She
plays Mildred Hayes, a
tough-as-nails mother
whose daughter was
raped and murdered seven
months previously, on a
lone stretch of road. Her
killer still hasn’t been
found, so Hayes erects
three billboards, calling
out the local police force
for their inaction. With
support from Woody
Harrelson, Sam Rockwell,
and Lucas Hedges, Three
Billboards takes on
heavy topics, like sexual
violence, police brutality,
and institutional racism –
it’s been picking up steam
on the awards circuit,
despite some critics
questioning McDonagh’s
treatment of sensitive
subjects.

emotional clout and
ambitious scope, and the
frat-boy hijinks of Every-
body Wants Some!! He
returns later this month
with Last Flag Flying, a
spiritual sequel to the 1973
film The Last Detail. Last
Flag Flying asks heavy
questions about the role
America has played in the
middle east over the last
two decades: taking place
in the winter of 2003,
we follow “Doc” (Steve
Carell), who makes a trip
cross-country to bury
his son, who was killed
in Iraq. He enlists two
old friends, Sal (Bryan
Cranston) and Richard
(Laurence Fishburne),
with whom he served in
Vietnam. On the surface
a gentle buddy comedy,
Linklater draws links
between the America
of the 70s with its more
modern iteration, suggest-
ing that some things never
really change.
Released 26th
January
Loveless
Russian director
Andrey Zvyagintsev
broke through into the
mainstream last year
with Leviathan – a tragic
retelling of the biblical
story of Job, this por-
tentous tragedy, of epic
proportions, set out to
expose the corruption that
lies at the heart of modern
Russia. He follows this
up with Loveless, which
again serves as a critique
of Russian life. Taking
as its starting point a
child who goes missing,
Loveless explores topics
as wide-ranging as class
divisions, married life,
and the callousness of
an overstretched police
force. With a painterly
eye, Zvyagintsev takes us
through a series of beau-
tifully-composed scenes,
which nevertheless retain
a sense of existential
dread.

The Shape of Water
Sally Hawkins is
one of the most unique
British actors working
today. Coming to public
consciousness with her
leading role in Mike
Leigh’s Happy-Go-Lucky
back in 2008, she returns
to the spotlight this award
season as the centrepiece
of Guillermo del Toro’s
fantasy drama The Shape
of Water. Set during the
height of the Cold War,
the same year as the
Cuban Missile Crisis,
The Shape of Water sees
Hawkins play Elisa, a
mute janitor who works
at a top secret govern-
ment facility. She falls in
love with an amphibian
creature the government
has captured, in a story of
forbidden passion, with
Michael Shannon taking
on the antagonist role
as Colonel Strickland,
who is in charge of the
facility. Michael Stuhl-
barg continues his sterling
support work as one of
the lab’s scientists, while
Octavia Spencer stars as
one of Elisa’s colleagues.
Del Toro is back where
he’s most comfortable: a
richly-textured world of
fantasy and drama, where
real life and the magical
coincide with ease and
grace. It’s definitely one
to watch.

Lady Bird
It’s been a while
coming. Over the last
decade, Greta Gerwig has
shown herself to be one of
the most exciting actors
and screenwriters of her
generation. From early
features in mumblecore
films, through to collabo-
rating with partner Noah
Baumbach in Frances Ha
and Mistress America,
two of the best comedies
to come out of America
in recent years. Now,
with Lady Bird, she has
shown what she can do
when given the freedom
to write and direct.
Starring Saoirse Ronan
as Christine “Lady Bird”
McPherson, Lady Bird is
a coming-of-age drama
indirectly inspired by
Gerwig’s own experiences
growing up. It arrives on
our shores trailing behind
it a stream of fervent
critical acclaim, as well
as box office clout – the
insightful screenplay, in
particular, has been high-
lighted as emotionally rich
and multifaceted, taking
the audience through the
an uncannily-familiar
adolescent experience.
Released 16th
