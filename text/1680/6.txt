Learning to grow old gracefully: the inevitability of
ageing
Some may hope that immortality is around the corner, but new research shows ageing may be here to stay.

A
geing, or se-
nescence, was
considered an
i n e s c a p a b l e
fate of living organisms
in the past, where stories
of immortality remained
in the realm of science
fiction. However, in
recent years, scientists
have developed compel-
ling theories to propose
a genetic basis to ageing,
implying a means to
either avoid or delay the
process. Nonetheless, new
scientific evidence shows
that ageing is, in fact,
inevitable!
Consider natural selec-
tion, a concept where indi-
viduals that are ‘fitter’ are
more likely to reproduce.
With more offspring, the
genes that are responsible
for ‘fitness’ are selected
and amplified over time.
offspring. This ‘selection
shadow’ for organisms
that pass their reproduc-
tive age permits genes that
contribute to late-stage
deleterious effects to be
passed on. These genes
are termed ‘longevity
genes’ and it was believed
that, by manipulating
these genes, slowing
ageing was no longer an
impossible task.
To understand these
longevity genes, scientists
have studied ageing in
various organisms at
a cellular level. It was
postulated that ‘garbage’,
like misfolded proteins,
needs to be removed from
a cell for normal function.
Failure to do so results
in cell malfunctioning
and senescence. This is
particularly enhanced in
single-celled organisms,
where there is intercellu-
lar competition between
somatic cells: the more
efficient the cell-garbage
removal processes are, the
longer the cell lives.
Comparably, in a multi-
cellular organism, similar
to you and I, intercellular
competition is also occur-
ring. Since we need our
cells to work with each
other to serve a larger
function (e.g. muscle cells
work together to form
a muscle tissue, which
can contract and allow
movement), removal of
non-cooperative cells is an
important task to maintain
the organism’s fitness.
Thus, it is imperative to
weed out non-functioning
cells that do not work well
together. Additionally,
intercellular competition
is constantly occurring,
where cells which are
unable to grow as well
as their counterparts are
eliminated, whilst highly
functioning cells, with
higher proliferative rate,
are selected.
are still allowed to grow.
Consider cancer cells that
out-compete other cells in
the region despite having
zero benefits to the host
organism. To eliminate
cancer, the extent of inter-
cellular competition must
be reduced, and this even-
tually leads to the decline
in cellular cooperation
and the subsequent ageing
process.
By studying fruit flies
and worms, evidence that
supports this notion was
shown, where intercellu-
lar competition prevents
accumulation of ageing
cells at the expense of
cancerous cell growth.
Vice versa, a delay of
intercellular competition
causes a loss of functional
cells, therefore cells
don’t cooperate as well
as before. This evidence
suggests that ageing is an
inevitable part of living.
Nevertheless, this topic
is under ongoing investi-
gation. By studying and
comparing the degree of
intercellular competition
in different species, the
process of ageing could
be understood better, and
perhaps, in the future, be
delayed!

ARE YOU INTERESTED IN
PARTICIPATING IN RESEARCH?
At Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust in West
London we are interested in finding out the effects of
hormones that control reproduction.
We are looking for healthy men (who do not
smoke and do not take any medication) aged
between 18 and 40 years. The study involves an
initial screening visit followed by up to 5 study
visits at the hospital. People who participate will
be paid expenses of up to £150 per study visit.

We are looking for healthy women and women
with PCOS (who do not smoke and do not take
any medication, including hormonal
contraceptives) aged between 18-35. The study
involves an initial screening visit followed by up
to 6 visits at the hospital. People who participate
will be paid expenses of up to £200 per study visit.

“It was

However, there is a
shortfall in this selecting
mechanism – genes that
promote fitness in youth,
but simultaneously have
damaging effects at a
later stage in life. In other
words, Mother Nature
stops selecting when the
organism starts to produce
