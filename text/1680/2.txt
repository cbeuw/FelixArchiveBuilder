Stella 4 had previously
been replaced with
Bud Light, which
prompted an outcry
among students

I
mperial College
Union has reverted
the house lager
to Stella 4, little
over three months after
replacing it with Bud
Light.
The decision was
announced by the Union
on Monday, and follows
a survey carried out at the
end of last term asking
membersfortheirtoppref-
erence for the house lager.
In a statement, a Union
spokesperson told Felix:
“The survey showed that
students wanted Stella 4
Universities minister replaced shortly after defending
Toby Young's appointment
vital work of broadening
access to higher education
and defending academic
freedom”.
An Imperial College
Union spokesperson told
Felix: “I am glad Toby
Young has chosen to step
down. His inappropriate
and often offensive
comments and arguments
made him unsuitable for
the position.”
They added: “He is not
representative of students
and the values of the
higher education sector.”
Johnson was also
removed from his post.
In addition to Young’s
appointment, Johnson had
clashed with the prime
minister over tuition
fees and the inclusion
of overseas students in
migration targets. Justine
Greening also lost her
position as education
secretary and left the

secretary. She is replaced
by Damian Hinds, who
was previously Minister

Who is Sam Gyimah?

banker, Gyimah became

to be our house lager. We
have listened to this and
acted accordingly.”
While the lager has
returned, however, the
cost per pint will in-
crease by 10p, to £2.80.
Matt Blackett, Deputy
President (Finance & Ser-
vices), previously made
a manifesto promise of
“no above-inflation drink
prices”.
One student told Felix: “I
don’t normally get lager
when I’m in the Union,
but I’m glad to see Stella
back.” Another said: “I
enjoy the taste of Stella 4
more.”
A Union spokesperson
told Felix: “The Union
is always looking to
improve services for
students and listening to
students’ views is critical
to this.” They said the
survey would “shape our
thinking on the future
primary supplier tender
process, ensuring student
views lie at the heart of all
the decisions we make.”
The initial removal of
Stella 4 from the Union
bars saw anger from
students, who accused the
Union of hypocrisy for not
consulting their members
on the change. A petition

comments,” May said.
“If he was to continue to
use that sort of language
and talk in that sort of
way, he would no longer
be in public office.”
Despite this, May
seemed to accept Young’s
apology for his previous
statements and declined to
sack him.
She was spared the
humiliation of a U-turn as
Young resigned just eight
days after his appoint-
ment, claiming that his
“ill-judged comments”
had become “a distrac-
tion from its [the OfS’]
whip and David Cam-
eron’s parliamentary
private secretary before
being appointed prisons
minister in July 2016.
Gyimah presided over
increased security meas-
ures for prison officers,
a crackdown on prison
contraband (including
drugs, drones, and mobile
phones), and an increase
in the maximum jail
sentence for stalking from
five years to ten years.
What else is Toby Young up to?
An annual eugenics conference
held at UCL has been linked to
white supremacists and Nazis in an
expose published by London Stu-
dent. The London Conference on
Intelligence (LCI) has been derided
by academics as pseudoscience.
Previous speakers include Toby
Young, who resigned from the
board of the Office for Students this
week, and Richard Lynn, the presi-
dent of the Ulster Institute of Social
Research. Lynn funds the LCI and
other far-right conferences via the
Pioneer Fund, a listed hate group.
UCL is investigating, and stated its
commitment to combating racism
and sexism.
“While Stella
4 has returned
to the bars,
the price has
increased by
10p, to £2.80 a
pint”
to “replace Bud Light
with an actual beer” was
quickly set up, attracting
nearly 300 signatures. The
Union claimed the change
to Bud Light would save
students over £10,000
during the academic year.
Students responded
positively to the change.

New year, same office
I
am not generally a
superstitious person.
I’ll avoid walking
under ladders, sure,
although I think that’s
a pretty sensible move
considering my clumsi-
ness, and I’ll say hello
to magpies to avoid bad
luck, but that’s a hangover
from my childhood. But
one thing that I do feel
merits special attention
is the beginning of a new
year.
Iknowit’sjustarandom
arbitrary date, marking
our spinning hunk of
rock making one whole
revolution around a giant
floating ball of burning
gas, and there shouldn’t
really be any reason to be
sentimental, or to make
any special commitments:
after all, we shouldn’t be
trying to be a nicer person
or drink more water for
just two weeks in January
– we should be doing both
all year round (doing one
good deed a day is just
as beneficial for a dewy
complexion as downing
two litres of mineral
water, trust me).
But skincare aside,
I do feel that there is
something rather magical
about hurtling headlong
into a new year. It feels
a bit like taking a dive in
freezing water – exciting
and slightly scary, as we
consider what the next
twelve months can bring.
Above all, it can be a
chance to reflect on what
we’ve learnt over the
previous twelve months,
and bring some of those
lessons into the year
ahead. So this year, I fully
embraced my supersti-
tious side, and arranged a
small meal for a handful
of friends, where we ate
food to bring good luck
and see in the new year:
lentils to bring wealth,
noodles to represent a
long life, pomegranates
to encourage abundance,
and even a galette de rois
to determine which of us
would have the best year
of all.
It was a lovely night,
but what made it really
special was sharing it
with the people I love and
care about. It is in these
relationships that we find
solidarity. Community.
Family.And taking time to
think about how 2017 has
treated me, I’ve come to
realise how much my life
has changed over the last
twelve months. This time
last year, I was planning
on running to be Felix
Editor (something I’d en-
courage anyone reading to
do, please.), and not sure
whether I’d be chosen
for the role. Fast-forward
twelve months, and I’m
here, on a Thursday
evening, writing these
words, having just about
got the hang of how all
this works (maybe).
But, whether or not
I’ve managed to perfect
the art of the editorial
yet, the biggest change
2017 brought was the new
people I’ve met, and the
connections I’ve made.
I spent today in an office
scented with toasted
bagels, whose kettle was
boiled at regular intervals,
provided cups of tea and
coffee for a wide range
of people – postgraduates
and undergraduates, biol-
ogists and physicists – all
brought together by their
love for the paper. There’s
nowhere else I’d rather be.
