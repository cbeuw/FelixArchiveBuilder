operatic take on Gandhi’s time in South Africa, these are the picks of the spring.

C
hristmas trees
are being thrown
out, commuters
are once again
heading grim-faced
into the bowels of the
Underground, and many
of you will be revising
for exams, or settling
back into another term of
lectures – there’s no doubt
about it, 2018 has official-
ly begun.
Over in Victoria,
Hamilton is getting into
the swing of its run, with
Lin-Manuel Miranda
hoping to recreate in
London the mania that
gripped New York in
2016. Quite aside from
Hamilton, there’s plenty
of shows and exhibitions
to look forward to in
London this term.
Rita, Sue, and Bob
Too
After allegations of
sexual misconduct arose
about Max Stafford-Clark,
one of the producers
involved with Rita, Sue
and Bob Too, a play that
follows two teenage
babysitters as they embark
on a sexual relationship
with their employer, The
Royal Court cancelled its
run. Following a public
outcry over the theatre
censorship, the decision
was reversed. The play,
which is semi-autobio-
graphical, was written by
Andrea Dunbar when she
was just 19. Its portrayal
of two girls on the cusp
of adulthood is vivid and
powerful. Far from being
something that should
be shelved in the era of
#MeToo, it is a necessary
staging.
At The Royal Court
from 9th
to 27th
January.
From £12.
The Brothers Size
Melding together
Yoruba mythology and a
searing portrayal of broth-
erly love, The Brothers
Sizeisarevivalofthedebut
play by writer Tarell Alvin
McCraney who also wrote
the Academy Award-win-
ning Moonlight. When
it was first staged at the
Young Vic ten years ago
it received widespread
critical acclaim for its
masterful mixing of ritual
and reality in a story about
two African-American
brothers: Ogun who is
sensible and the wilder
Oshoosi who has just been
released from prison.
At the Young Vic from
19th
January to 14th
February. From £10.
Satyagraha
The word satyagraha,
is derived from Sanskrit
and means “the strength
of truth”. Mahatma
Gandhi used the concept
of satyagraha to guide his
campaign of non-violent
resistance to colonial rule
in India which eventually
led to India’s independ-
ence in 1947. Philip Glass’
operatic masterpiece tells
the story of Gandhi’s early
years in South Africa
where he first began to
form the ideas of non-vio-
lent protest to bring about
seismic political change.
In doing so Glass provides
commentary on the nature
of war and politics in the
world. As with Akhnaten
and Einstein on the
Beach, the other two
operas in Glass’ Portraits
trilogy, Glass eschews
conventional narrative,
and Satyagraha weaves
Gandhi’s story into scenes
from the Hindu epic
Mahabharata. There is
no dialogue, instead the
principles and chorus sing
verses adapted from the
Bhagavad Gita. Grand in
scope and spectacular in
its delivery, Satyagraha
promises to be magnifi-
cent.
At the English National
Opera from 1st
to 27th
February. From £12
All Too Human: Ba-
con, Freud, and a
Century of Painting
Life
No one exemplifies the
legacy of British figura-
tive art more than Francis
Bacon and Lucian Freud,
both of whom sought to
capture vitality of their
subjects in their portraits.
Freud’s almost sculptural
use of paint inspired Jenny
Saville’s visceral depic-
tion of the abundance
of flesh. All Too Human
will seek to draw out the
threads linking Bacon,and
Freud to contemporaries
Frank Auerbach and Paula
Rego, as well as placing
their paintings in context
of those by the previous
generation which included
Walter Sickert and David
Bomberg.
At Tate Britain from 28th
February to 27th
August.
From £16.
Picnic at Hanging
Rock
Playwright Tom Wright
adapts Joan Lindsay’s
classic exploration of the
clash between Victorian
sensibilities and primal
nature in Barbican’s
Picnic at Hanging Rock
this February. Drawing
on the psychological
undertones of the original
source material, director
Matthew Lutton takes
us through this dark tale:
three schoolgirls and their
teacher decide to head to a
rural spot one day in 1900,
and mysteriously vanish.
They are never seen again.
A haunting pick, which is
not to be missed.
At Barbican from 21st
February to 24th
February.
From £16
Picasso 1932
Picasso can be a
dizzying artist to get to
grips with, producing
over 50,000 works in
his lifetime, ranging
from cubism to realism,
clothwork to paintings.
Luckily, the Tate Modern
decide to narrow things
down for us, picking
only a single year in
the artist’s life: 1932.
It was an exceptionally
creative time for Picasso,
and the works on offer
explore his creative drive
and personal struggles.
Somewhat amazingly, it
will be the Tate Modern’s
first solo Picasso exhi-
bition, and is set to be a
spring blockbuster.
At Tate Modern from
8th
March - 9th
September
From £20
