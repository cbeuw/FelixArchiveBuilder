Solving our environmental problems without
hindering reproductive rights
Some people argue that the environmental impact of the pill should be reflected in increased
tax on users, but this would limit access for thousands of women across the country.

I
read a Forbes article
by Tim Worstall
recently, where he
suggests that women
using the contraceptive
pill should pay £1105
($1500) in tax to due
to its environmental
impact. That’s right: a
bank-breaking one thou-
sand pounds per woman.
Such a tax would signifi-
cantly limit access to the
pill – I personally would
not be able to afford it if
I were charged that much.
If we allow any form of
contraception to be taxed,
regardless of the size of
the tax, then we make it
acceptable to limit access
to it. But we can solve
our environmental issues
without hindering the
ability of people to control
their own bodies.
The contraceptive pill
contains the hormone
ethinyl estradiol (EE2),
which is not removed by
the sewage system, and
remains in wastewater.
It can lead to intersex
changes in fish, causing
populations to decline or
even collapse as males are
eliminated. Mr Worstall
bases his tax conclusions
on a 2012 paper by Owen
and Jobling in Nature. It
states that the total cost
for the UK to update the
sewage system is more
than £30bn, and the
yearly running cost per
plant would be £800,000.
Since then, the EU has
placed EE2, and other
pharmaceuticals, under
regulation. To meet the
cost, options discussed
were an increase in
household bills or a tax on
pharmaceutical compa-
nies. Big Pharma, whose
profit margins outstrip
those of banks, the media,
and oil and gas, claimed
they cannot pay the tax
due to the cost of R&D.
only EE2), and, as far as
I can tell from research, it
is the tax-payer, not Big
Pharma, paying.
Mr Worstall bases his
argument on the principle
of “polluter should pay”:
if you use the pollutant
then you ‘should’ be
taxed for it. But he does
not explore this argument
fully. EE2 is not the
only chemical wreaking
environmental havoc that
sewage systems do not
remove: antibiotics are not
removed by the sewage
system, and studies show
that this is contributing
to antibiotic resistance
as the antibiotics interact
with bacteria associated
with sewage treatment
plants. Following his line
of argument, we should
also tax anyone who uses
antibiotics.
Other chemicals not
completely removed
include pesticides, her-
bicides, and household
chemicals. Pesticides and
herbicides impact the
growth and reproduction
of wildlife, and cause
lowered disease resistance
and death. Household
chemicals – shampoo,
detergent, toothpaste
– have similar effects.
Phosphates in detergent
encourage the growth of
toxic algae which reduces
water oxygen levels,
reducing aquatic diversity.
Should we tax homeown-
ers for using laundry
detergent? We need to be
fair if we tax anyone for
the associated pollution
of the chemicals they use.
Otherwise, Mr Worstall
seems to be suggesting
that we single out women
on the pill.

Mr Worstall states
that women have other
options: “…there are a
number of alternative
methods, various barriers,
creams, sponges, IUDs,
which do not carry this
environmental cost….”
I am not convinced he
knows much about female
contraception. Choice
of contraception is not a
flippant decision, given
that each option works
differently, and women’s
bodies respond different-
ly. There is no ‘one size
fits all’method, so it needs
to be easy for people to
choose the option that
suits them.

longer than a sentence
together and certainly
not an eloquent article. I
will spell it out for you:
if you want your views
represented in the paper
then you have to write for
it. Bitching on Imperial
Secrets won’t change that,
you fucking lemon.
Moving on to the
main topic of this week’s
venting of spleen: New
Year, and why it can fuck
off. New Year, or, as I
prefer to know it, ‘the
collective hangover from
the Christmas, and the last
excuse for freedom before
the grinding drudgery of
everyday life begins’, is
widely celebrated all over
the world for some reason.
Exactly what that reason
mostly the same. I just
hope people are equally
overjoyed when a giant
space death ball obeys the
very same laws and wipes
out civilisation.
Like a prisoner
dragging a ball and chain
behind him, the New Year
brings with it a flood of
retrospective contempla-
tion about your personal
achievements and failures
of the year behind you as
well as a strange sense of
optimism about the world
being a better place simply
because the number at the
end of the date has incre-
mented by one. I despise
optimism in general, but
especially the form that it
takes at New Year’s: the
resolutions. Resolutions,
next to the American
way of writing the date,
are possibly the stupidest
thing that human beings
have come up with. On
a serious note, what kind
of perverse mind decided
that the date should be
written that way? If any
other nation also copies
this system, then you
too are a bunch of stupid
pricks.
I am unsure exactly
what it is about resolu-
tions that makes me so
angry. It could be the
insincerity of it, or the fact
that everyone approaches
them with the genuine
belief that the future will
be better than the past,
rather than acknowledge
that it will be identical
except with hangovers
as a growing up present.
For those of you yet to
experience a hangover,
it’s like being hit on the
head by the Hunchback of
Notre Dame, while your
body attempts to turn you
inside out in the mistaken
belief that this will help in
any way. Imagine being
completely immobilised
and also staring at your
own vomit on a plug
socket for an entire day
and throwing up every
time you put something in
your mouth. That is your
future: a sad pile of puke
next to your face. Happy
New Year.
already given birth. Sper-
micide creams have to be
used alongside another
form of contraception,
as alone they fail 30%
of the time. A diaphragm
(barrier), used with
spermicide, has an effec-
tiveness of 92-96% but
carries a risk of bladder
infection and toxic shock
syndrome. A change of
weight of only 3kg means
a new diaphragm has to
be fitted, and while some
women may find it simple
to place in and remove
a sponge or diaphragm
before and after sex,
others would not. A tax
on the pill would leave
options which are less
effective and more hassle
– options which don’t suit
a busy lifestyle. Sorry Mr
Worstall, I am quite busy
working towards a career.
The IUD and implant
are 99% effective and
preferred if women are
likely to forget the pill.
However, given that they
are invasive, there’s a
small risk of infection and
the IUD can cause pain
or bleeding. Furthermore,
the implant can’t be used
with certain medications
or antibiotics. Condoms
are 98% effective, and
unlike other methods
protect against STIs; but
they are much less easy to
accessforfreeontheNHS,
and in stores they can be
expensive. While some
women may experience
side-effects from the pill,
tives can have an impact
on the environment: latex
condoms, for example,
contain additives to
prevent breakage, but
this means they take a
long time to break down.
Some condoms are
non-biodegradable, while
the one biodegradable
condom is made of natural
lambskin, but does not
protect from some STIs.
Who should we tax for
the environmental impact
of condoms? Again, Mr
Worstall has forgotten
about his own ‘polluter
should pay’ argument.
From another angle, it
would also be unfair to
only allow richer women
to use the pill. We cannot
ignore the fact that un-
intended pregnancy dis-
proportionately impacts
women in poorer com-
munities. Limiting their
access to contraception
only makes it harder for
them to control their lives
and invest in their futures.
And, what does Mr
Worstall think of the
economic and social costs
of unintended pregnan-
cy? The environmental
impact of unintended
extra humans? He doesn’t
consider any of this in his
article. These are issues
that should be considered
before placing a tax on
contraception.
Regardless of whether
one or several contra-
ceptive methods are
taxed, taxing any form
of contraception turns it
into a political, social, and
economic issue. Limiting
access jeopardizes the
health of women by
reducing access to basic,
preventative healthcare.
Contraception reduces
unintended pregnancy
and abortion; it helps
women control their own
lives and invest in their
futures; it helps couples
plan families. It’s not hard
to guess that a tax on one
of the main forms of con-
traception may influence
numbers of unintended
pregnancies.
Contraception saves
governments across the
world billions in health-
care costs. Women who
cannot afford contracep-
tion, or to look after a
baby, still have sex. An
NHS report showed that
between 2013 and 2020,
unintended pregnancy and
STIs will cost between
£84.4-127 billion.
Continued cuts could
increase this by £8.3-10
billion. Improved access,
compared to current
access, would save £3.7-5

But even these alterna-

It makes sense to upgrade
it so that it removes all
harmful substances, to
prevent other environ-
mental issues, as well
as feminisation of fish.
Methods that remove
EE2, antibiotics, and
other substances have
been tested. There needs
to be a general tax for
all upgrades, and either
tax payers or relevant
companies need to pay.
The authors of the main
study were concerned
the decision would be
made behind closed doors
and that the government
would not engage the
public. I don’t know about
you, but this article was
the first I had heard of it.

the generations to come
have the capacity, moral
sense, and intelligence to

we believe in.
