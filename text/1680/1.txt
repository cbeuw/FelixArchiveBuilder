Felix
Jo Johnson out as universities minister in
cabinet reshuffle

A
new universi-
ties minister
has been
named in
Theresa May’s cabi-
net reshuffle. Former
prisons minister Sam
Gyimah takes over
from Jo Johnson, who
has been moved to the
Department for Trans-
port (DfT). Johnson has
faced pressure in recent
weeks over the appoint-
ment of Toby Young to
the board of the Office
for Students (OfS), the
body responsible for
holding universities to
account. Among those
raising concerns, Impe-
rial’s assistant provost
(equality, diversity and
inclusion) Professor Ste-
phen Curry, vice-provost
(education) Professor
Simone Buitendijk, and
College Union President
Alex Compton co-
signed an open letter to
Johnson, questioning
Young’s suitability for
the role.
Young, a journalist and
advocate for free schools,
was criticised heavily for
his lack of experience and
relevant qualifications.
Further anger arose over
comments Young had
made on Twitter and in
his columns, which were
derogatory to women,
disabled people, and
working class students.
Critics have claimed
that these statements are
inconsistent with the
OfS’ duty to “promote
equality of opportunity
in connection with access
to and participation in
higher education”. Young
subsequently deleted
thousands of tweets from
his account, describing
his previous comments as
“sophomoric and silly”.
Professor Curry’s letter,
however, notes that Young
was already a “mature
adult” when the tweets
were posted. The letter
further states: “[Young’s]
attempt to characterise
these [comments] as
student behaviour shows
that he is out of touch
with the standards of
conduct we would expect
of our students at Imperial
College.”
The letter also criti-
cised Young’s articles on
educational theory and
‘progressive eugenics’,
calling them unscholarly
and flawed.
Johnson claimed that
Young’s appointment
would help to provide “the
scrutiny and challenge to
the [education] sector that
students and taxpayers
deserve” as Young is not
a university insider. This
seemed to indicate that the
Department for Education
(DfE) was backtracking
from its previous exag-
gerated claims that Young
had held teaching posts at
Harvard and Cambridge
university. Young also dis-
tanced himself from these
statements, acknowl-
edging that while he had
taught undergraduates at
both universities, he had
never held an academic
post.
Johnson’s defence of
Young has been linked to
his subsequent transfer
to the DfT. Speaking to
the BBC’s Andrew Marr,
Theresa May said she had
not been aware of Young’s
past behaviour at the time
of his appointment.
