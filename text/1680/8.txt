Blood and guts (and laughter) in ancient Rome
TitusAndronicushitstheBarbicanstagewithabang,bringingseveredlimbsaplenty,butalsoremindingusofthe
similarities between past and present.
T
itus Andronicus,
one of
Shakespeare’s
Roman plays,
has this fall reached
the London stage at the
Barbican. It is the story of
the fictive Roman general
Titus Andronicus, who
returns to Rome after
having entrapped Tamora,
Queen of the Goths, and
her three sons. The eldest
son will soon be killed,
and a series of revenges
are set in motion. The play
follows the struggle and
strife for ultimate revenge
between the emperor of
Rome, the Goths, and the
Andronicus family; a vio-
lent journey characterized
by sorrow and a couple of
beheadings.
The play starts subtly.
Actors are crossing the
stage. Their appearance,
with their relaxed posture
and casual clothing, make
them easy to mistake as
people working on the set.
As the number of actors
increases it becomes clear
that this is a part of the
play, and soon they are
all dancing. The dance
becomes a battle which
sets the hostile atmos-
phere that will remain
throughout the play’s
three hour run-time.
“The hostile
atmosphere is
established at
the start, and
continues for
the three-hour
runtime”
wondering if this was not
only the end of the act,
but of the play itself. It is
a well needed pause, and
with some time to reflect
over all the impressions
from the first act, I re-en-
tered the theatre curious,
but also anxious, ponder-
ing what was to come.
The second act was much
more enjoyable. The
intensity grew as the play
progressed – interactions
with the audience, more
and more complicated
revenges, and a severed
limb here and there kept
the audience more than
awake.
There is a duality of
emotions and how the
actors portray their char-
acters in Titus Andronicus.
An example is Saturninus,
the man who in the begin-
ning is elected as the next
emperor of Rome. With
his political speeches and
classy blue suits Saturni-
nus resembles any modern
day politician. The most
powerful man of the
country is, however, rid-
iculed almost throughout
the whole play. The char-
ismatic and secure man in
front of the camera’s lens
is, behind closed doors,
just another insecure fool
in Superman pyjamas.
The contrast between
the public and private
way of acting among the
characters is a recurring
theme: all the characters,
including Titus himself,
act strangely from time
to time, providing the
audience with a great
laugh, but also giving us
opportunity to reflect on
the acts of our own era’s
influential people.
The whole play is set
in an environment that
reminds us more of our
own time than historical
Rome: cameramen run
around capturing political
events, people in the
crowd take selfies, and
a “Deliveroma” man
delivers messages. The
familiar setting makes the
play, with all its horror
and brutality, more relat-
able for the audience, and
allows us to compare and
question the similarities
and differences between
our modern society and
the play itself. There is
a comfort in knowing
that, despite how terrible
the political situation in
the world might seem,
we will never reach the
same level of insanity as
in Titus Andronicus. But
if we dig deeper in our
analysis we soon see how
keeping all the factors
that makes it an enjoyable
play.
The two things that
stick in my memories
of the play are brutal-
ity and, surprisingly,
laughter. Laughter is a
regular reaction from the
audience, probably just
as regular as the killing.
Titus Andronicus is a
truly entertaining play:
the acting, the interaction
with the audience, the
small comments – it all
adds up to a humour that
is necessary in order to
deal with all the death and
unpleasant events of this
play. Whether you want
to analyse the political
situation and acts of the
characters in this play, or
went purely just to have a
good time, Titus Andron-
icus has something for
you. Though I would not
recommend it if you’re
not the biggest fan of
blood, despite the fact that
it’s pretty morbid from
time to time, it remains
the funniest tragedy I have
ever seen.

Pinocchio ends up a little wooden…
T
he National
Theatre’s winter
p r o d u c t i o n
of Pinocchio
is based on the 1940
Disney film, including
songs from the original.
Broadly following the
original, it adds in some
minor changes: Gepetto,
the old and lonely puppet
maker, longs for a child
of his own even as he
creates puppets for other
children. He is visited
by The Blue Fairy who
commissions him to make
a puppet boy from the tree
she has brought with her,
and, as Gepetto carves
out the puppet, he comes
to life. Gepetto names the
puppet boy Pinocchio and
decides to raise him as his
own; Pinocchio, like in the
Disney film, is fascinated
by the human children he
sees playing and longs to
be a ‘real boy’.
The story boils down to
Pinocchio’s quest to find
out what humanity really
means, and, in doing so,
to become human. This
production plays with this
concept in an interesting
way: the human char-
acters like Gepetto and
Stromboli, a travelling
circus owner who impris-
ons Pinocchio during his
quest, are all portrayed by
giant puppets, operated
by actors, one of whom
provides the voice. In
contract, Pinocchio, our
puppet protagonist, is
played traditionally by a
single actor. This creates
a great contrast and really
brings out the essence of
the story, highlighting the
difference between man
and puppet by flipping
their portrayal. It’s unfor-
tunate that the production
doesn’t fully commit to
this idea: although The
Blue Fairy is a puppet in
her first appearance, in
subsequent scenes she is
played by a single actor,
which somewhat ruins
the effect established in
the beginning scenes.
Similarly, The Fox, a
malicious being who
seeks to trick Pinocchio,
is also played by a single
actor, and these scenes
lack the effect created by
the scenes with Gepetto
and Pinocchio – you can’t
help but think that The
Fox as a puppet may have
been more menacing.
The plot deviates only
slightly from the Disney
film, but somehow
manages to feel worn out
and predictable. Perhaps
it’s because the basic
story is one that we have
seen told over and over
again in other media, but
the production fails to
excite. Pinocchio leaves
his father in search of
meaning and adventure,
only to realise that the true
meaning of humanity lies
in his father’s love. The
script, by Dennis Kelly,
adds nothing of substance
to the bare bones of the
tale – almost every line is
predictable and many of
the key moments fall flat.
Young children will likely
still enjoy it, but adults ac-
Fairy as Pinocchio’s con-
science and companion.
She manages to convey
emotion and real char-
acter through her voice
alone, all whilst handling
the character’s puppet.
Unfortunately, many of
the other actors fall far
short of Bisson’s perfor-
mance. Mark Hadfield’s
performance as Gepetto
is by no means poor and,
in an ordinary portrayal,
may well have been quite
engaging. However, his
voice acting fails to bring
the puppet Gepetto to life
the way Bisson does for
Jiminy. The ‘non-puppet’
actors – Joe Idris-Roberts
as Pinocchio and David
Langham as The Fox –
are both rather weak;:they
deliver overexaggerated
performances clearly
aimed to appeal to a young
child audience. However,
it detracts from the story
and only draws attention
to the poor script.
There is still a lot to be
said for this production,
however. The effects are
impressive and you can’t
help but marvel at the
technical genius behind
it. Monstro, a giant whale,
is impressively created
on stage, and the moment
where Pinocchio and
Jiminy are swallowed
by the whale is visually
striking – one of the
best of the performance.
Martin Lowe’s score is
based on the songs from
the film, but adapted
to better suit this stage
version. All of the musical
performances are without
fault, and really carry the
entire production.
It’s a real pity that the
script and acting let down
the many great aspects of
this production. The use
of giant puppets to portray
human characters is such
a fitting choice for this
story and has real poten-
tial to be impressive, and
there are certainly some
standout moments. Ulti-
mately though, it fails to
create any real emotional
impact and you’re left
feeling indifferent, even
in the grand climax of
Pinocchio’s quest.
