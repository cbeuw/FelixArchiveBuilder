T
he T. S. Eliot
Prize, awarded
by the Poetry
Book Society, is
arguably one of the most
prestigious poetry prizes
in the world. Awarded
every year to a poetry
collection in English first
published in the UK or
Ireland, it has seen many
household names winning
in the past, including Ted
Hughes, Carol Ann Duffy,
Seamus Heaney, and
Derek Walcott.
The Poetry Book
society started the prize
in 1993, on their 40th an-
niversary, in honour of its
founding poet T.S. Eliot.
Since then, along with the
Forward Prize in poetry, it
has become one of the two
most important literary
prizes in the UK dedicated
solely to poetry. This year,
to mark the 25th anniver-
sary of the prize, the prize
money has been increased
to £25,000.
The shortlist is an-
nounced every October,
and 2017’s was selected
out of 154 entries, by
judges Bill Herbert, James
Lasdun, and Helen Mort.
As per tradition, shortlist-
ed poets will participate
in a reading at the Royal
Festival Hall this Sunday.
As poet Sandeep
Parmar noted in his article
in The Guardian, while
this year’s shortlist is
definitely deserving, there
is a glaring lack of BAME
poets, especially since
2017 has seen a signifi-
cant amount of work from
BAME poets published,
including Kayo Ching-
onyi, Richard Georges,
André Naffis-Sahely, and
Nick Makoha, among
others.
The only minority poet
on the shortlist, however,
has always been one of my
favourite poets, and I’m
glad that he has made the
list: Ocean Vuong is a Vi-
etnamese-American poet
whose poetry has always
sounded like music to me.
His work often combines
the balladic nature of his
grandmother’s stories
and folk songs with his
keen grasp of the English
language. Born on a rice
farm outside Saigon, he
arrived in the US at the
age of two after his family
spent a year in a refugee
camp in the Philippines.
His collection Night Sky
with Exit Wounds explores
themes of home, loss,
and family, opening with
‘Telemachus’, a poem
about the relationship
between the narrator and
his father, which is at once
both intimate and distant,
personal and anony-
mous. The title itself,
‘Telemachus’, suggests
the fraught homecoming
of Odysseus to his son.
Indeed, classical referenc-
es dot the collection, often
in order to deepen themes
and reveal the paradoxes
behind complex emotions.
The collection that
struck me most was
Jacqueline Saphra’s All
My Mad Mothers, which
explores love, sex, and
family through themes
related to motherhood.
Her poems are bold and
energetic, words that
bound along, extrava-
gantly painting a picture
of what a mother is, in
all her multitudes. The
title poem, ‘All My Mad
Mothers’, describes the
narrator’s mother ‘trying
to catch the sun’, ‘sucking
fruit flies through a straw’,
‘barely spoke between her
bruises’, and finally, ‘hard
to grasp’, trying ‘to ease
her way into this world. Or
out of it.’ The mother is at
once imaginary and very
real. This is not a standard
collection of poetry ap-
preciating motherhood or
elevating mother-daughter
relationships. Instead, this
is a collection that paints
motherhood in all the its
gritty detail: the abuse,
the disappointment, the
monotony, but also the
inevitable celebration of
love.
As for the collection
that seems the most timely,
Robert Minhinnick’s
Diary of the Last Man
tackles the current major
issues facing the world.
He starts by meditating on
the environmental apoc-
alypse, then moves on to
the horrors of war in the
Middle East. Interesting-
ly, in the same collection
he also offers translations
from Welsh, Arabic, and
Turkish. Throughout the
collection, there is a sense
of urgency – that time is
running out for humanity
and there are too many
terrible things that are
allowed to happen. There
is a running theme of
loneliness and uncertainty
– ‘Perhaps/I am the last
man’. It is an unforgiving

collection, blunt about the
atrocities of the world, but
among this the kindness
that remains becomes
even more poignant.
It is a strong shortlist
this year with very current
themes, and it will be in-
teresting to see who wins.
Regardless of the winner,
the shortlist shows that
poetry is still relevant in
expressing the human
condition in all its forms,
from politics and family
to displacement and loss.
