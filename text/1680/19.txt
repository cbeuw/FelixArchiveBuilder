I
mperial College
Neuroscience Society
will be holding their
annual conference
on the 27th
of January,
2018, in the Sir Alexander
Fleming Building (South
Kensington Campus).
There are several exciting
talks and workshops
planned, covering
wide-ranging topics, from
neuropsychiatry and
advances in cognitive
neuroscience, to live brain
dissections and clinical
neuroscience! As ever,
food and refreshments
will be provided through-
out the day.
We are proud to
welcome a variety of
renowned speakers
who are experts in their
fields, and will provide
an engaging and enlight-
ening experience. This
year, we have included
TWO live brain dissection
workshops with Professor
Steve Gentleman, who
will also explain the use
of the Parkinson Brain
Bank at Imperial College
London.
We have more speakers
than ever before joining
our symposia, with several
keynote talks. These
speakers include Dr.
Edward Wild, a specialist
in neuro-genetics, as well
as Dr. Bianca Jupp, who
has an interest in the neu-
robiology of addiction.
Speakers will discuss not
only the clinical aspects
of neuroscience – as will
be seen in Dr. Lim’s talk
on neuro-inflammation
– but also technological
and scientific advances
in neuroscience as will
be demonstrated by Prof.
Sven Bestmann’s talk
on models for non-in-
vasive brain stimulation
in health and disease.
Specialist talks will cover
areas such as paediatric
neuroscience, discussed
by Dr. Lucinda Carr, as
well as various aspects
of cognitive neuroscience
presented by Dr. Qadeer
Arshad and Dr. Parashkev
Nachev!
Visit our Facebook
page for further speaker
details, and the list of
speaker announcement
closer to the event date!
There will be an
informal careers event
after the talk which many
of the speaker will attend,
giving you the opportu-
nity to meet some of the
speakers and discuss their
work further!
We are also now
accepting abstract sub-
missions! Don’t miss a
chance to present your
research to peers, as well
as the speakers attending
the event. We will be
awarding certificates for
the best posters with the
help of our expert judges.
Hope to see you all there!

IC SWIMMING AND
WATER POLO DIVES
INTO THE NEW
YEAR
T
he Swimming
and Water Polo
Club is looking
forward to a
crucial term, with both
the Men’s and Women’s
Water Polo teams keen
to secure some wins after
difficult spells last term.
The Men’s team has its
first challenge of the New
Year on Saturday as they
face the University of the
West of England at home.
The match promises to
be a physical one, but the
team will have to make
their superior speed and
skill count against the
brute force of UWE. The
Women’s team will have
to wait longer to kick-start
their 2018, as they play
Exeter at home on 27th
January. They will be keen
to exact their revenge
after losing the away
fixture dramatically, in a
game which saw Maria
Medeiros heroically play
the second half with what
later turned out to be a
dislocated shoulder.
The Swimming team is
gearing up to host teams
from across London in the
next round of the London
Swimming League at
Ethos on the afternoon
of Saturday 3rd
February.
The previous round at
UCL saw fantastic IC
participation, with many
swimmers entering their
first ever swimming com-
petition. It also saw, rather
predictably, UCL forget to
bring along diving blocks,
adding that little bit extra
to everybody’s times.
Feel free to come along to
support at Ethos, or join at
the after party in Metric
where drink tokens will
be just £2.50.
Before then, anyone
struggling to lose those
festive pounds is welcome
to try any of the range
of activities we offer. If
you’d like to swim, come
to the pool in Ethos on
Wednesdays 2.00pm
to 3.30pm, where you
can expect a coached,
fitness-based session in
a friendly group. For the
extra keen, land training
is on just before this at
1.00pm on the first floor of
the Union Building. This
intense workout consists
of a variety of bodyweight
exercises and is run by the
charismatic and undeni-
ably charming Andrew
Duckworth. If you’re up
for trying something new,
water polo might just be
for you. Great fun and a
real whole body workout,
our sessions are structured
by our coach Adam (Last
year’s Sport Imperial
Coach of the Year) or
one of our experienced
players. They take place
on Monday’s and Friday’s
from 8.45pm to 10.00pm,
also in Ethos. To find out
more about what we have
to offer, you can find us
on Facebook, Instagram,
Snapchat, or our website.
Come along, you might
just love it!
