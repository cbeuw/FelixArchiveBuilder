The Twilight Zone – between fact and fiction
The Almeida Theatre take on an ambitious project, weaving eight episodes of the classic TV series into a cohesive
work of theatre that dazzles and delights.
B
etween light and
shadow, science
and superstition,
fear and knowl-
edge is a dimension of
imagination. An area we
call the Twilight Zone.”
Amidst all the Christ-
mas shows and panto-
mimes filling theatres in
December, the Almeida
Theatre takes on this brave
adaptation of the early
1960s American sci-fi TV
series. I’d never watched
the original show, but
being a fan of old sci-fi,
I couldn’t pass up the op-
portunity to see how a cult
show could translate from
screen to stage. I have to
admit, my expectations
were high: the Almeida’s
minimalist posters and
cryptic descriptions had
piqued my interest.
American playwright
Anne Washburn adapts
eight separate episodes
of the 150-episode TV
series but chooses to
string them together as a
whole. Different stories
intertwine and intersect:
a mysterious alien guest
has creeped into a diner
in a snowstorm; a young
girl gets whisked from
her bedroom and trapped
in between dimensions;
astronauts just returned
to Earth start to vanish
one by one. These are just
three of the eight episodes,
and it already sounds like
an eclectic mix of stories
that couldn’t possible
form a cohesive whole.
But, somehow, Washburn
manages to achieve just
that: she jumps between
stories with ease – never
in a way that seems
confused or unintention-
al – to create something
truly unique.
The real standout is
the final story: a nuclear
threat and everyone’s
consequent race to save
themselves bring to light
racial tensions between
neighbours in an oth-
erwise idyllic suburb.
A black couple, a white
couple, and a Jewish
immigrant break into a
fierce fight over who has
the most right to their
friend’s nuclear bunker,
one into which they are
trying to force their way.
It brings up ideas on what
it is to be American, as
each individual argues
their superior claim, high-
“Somehow,
director Anne
Washburn
manages to
jump between
stories with
ease”
“The acting
really captures
the cheesy
vibe of late-
50s/early-60s
television”
lighting the absurdity of
nationalism and drawing
not-so-subtle compari-
sons to the present day.
Opinion might vary on
whether this is timely and
topical or an exploita-
tion of a subject that, at
present, seems ubiquitous
in the media. Personally,
it felt apt – the nuclear
threat characterised the
early 60s captures the
essence of the time period
of the show whilst being
undeniably relevant to the
audience seeing it today.
There are obviously
fond references to the
original show that were,
as a Twilight Zone novice,
a little lost upon me, but
this doesn’t really hamper
enjoyment, and most of
the references are enjoya-
ble as jokes in their own
right. One running gag
across the stories features
mysteriously appearing
cigarettes, what I later
learned to be a reference
to the constant smoking in
the original show. Knowl-
edge of the original show
does clearly make this
funnier, but it’s played in
such a way that it becomes
a joke in its own right.
The stage is set up to
look like an old TV set,
complete with the CBS
logo every time the curtain
is down. The original
show was in black and
white, and this production
sticks to that aesthetic,
with a black backdrop
covered in white stars and
a cast dressed primarily
in black and white. I
was a massive fan of the
aesthetic and, especially,
the 50s and 60s outfits of
the cast. The staging of
the play is part tribute and
part parody, and – perhaps
inevitably, considering its
source material – often
very, very weird. There
are moments when actors
in black jumpsuits and
goggles carry cardboard
images across the stage
in an imitation of opening
and closing credits – it
sounds bizarre but it’s
undeniable that it works.
It manages to hit the right
balance between genuine
imitation and parody so
that, with the appropriate
suspension of disbelief,
you can buy into it.
The cast is great: the
actors play multiple roles
across the different stories,
and no single person really
stands out. But this seems
almost like a conscious
effort that makes it feel
more like a TV show with
an ensemble cast rather
than the heavy focus on
a few leads that we more
commonly see in theatre.
There are obviously flaws,
but honestly, they just add
to the character of the
performance. The uniform
overacting from the cast
captures the cheesy late
50s/early 60s vibe and
makes you feel like you’re
really watching television
enacted before you – a
show within a show in the
best way.
I left the performance
determined to start
watching the original
show, at least to see the
eight episodes adapted,
but knowing, in the back
of my guilty mind, that it
was all too likely I would
end up binging all 150
episodes over my Christ-
mas holiday. If the idea
of all that time lost to TV
doesn’t scare you, or if
you’re already a die-hard
fan of the TV series, this
adaptation of The Twilight
Zone is one not to be
missed.
