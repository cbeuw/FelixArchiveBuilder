Levels 4 and 5 of

at the end of last term,
following long-awaited
improvement works.
The two floors had been
closed since the beginning
of summer to install
cooling and ventilation
systems. Student feed-

temperature control was
a problem, with Library
Services calling it “the
single biggest source
of complaint from the
student body for several
years”.
The changes were
initially scheduled to
be completed by the
beginning of November.
Students and staff high-
lighted the improvements
in power accessibility, but
some said the library was

Imperial-educated doctor claims university stress led
to alcohol addiction
A
n Imperial-ed-
ucated junior
doctor this
week avoided
a prison sentence fol-
lowing two arrests for
drink-driving.
Lauren Fowler, 25, who
graduated from Imperial
College London last year,
said the stress of studying
had left her addicted to
alcohol. She appeared at
Stockport Magistrates’
Court this Monday after
being arrested twice in the
last year for driving under
the influence. She was
bailed following her first
offence, during which she
crashed her car in a busy
pedestrian area. Less than
two months following
this, she was arrested
again after drinking half
a bottle of vodka and
driving around a hotel car
park.
In a statement read out
in court it was claimed
Fowler “drank at universi-
ty to cope with the stress,
and she didn’t know who
to go to for help with
her addiction.” Fowler
attended Imperial as a
direct entry student, after
studying in Cambridge for
the first three years of her
degree.
In a 2015 survey by
the National Union of
Students, it was reported
that 85% of students
felt drinking was part of
university culture, while
5% of students had driven
whilst over the legal limit.
The majority were not
aware of any safe drinking
campaigns at their univer-
sity.
A College spokesper-
son said it “would not be
appropriate” to comment
on individual cases, but
said Imperial is “com-
mitted to promoting the
health and well-being of
its students, and offers
any students with alcohol
or substance misuse
problems the opportunity
to obtain support and be
treated sensitively.”
Fowler will now face a
disciplinary investigation
from the General Medical
Council.

Imperial fined after
death of lab research-
er
Imperial College
London was fined
£70,000 last December,
following the death of a
lab researcher.
Damien Bowen, 32, as-
phyxiated on 23rd
October,
2011 at St Stephens
Centre Laboratory, which
is owned by Chelsea and
Westminster NHS Trust.
Mr Bowen had been
decanting liquid nitrogen
alone in a non-ventilated
room where the extraction
system had been switched
off.
Mr Bowen was em-
ployed by Chelsea and
Westminster NHS Trust.
Imperial College owned
the liquid nitrogen used,
and was undertaking work
in the laboratory suite.
Judge Michael Grieve
QC said the College “ac-
cepted that the risk assess-
ment was insufficient”.
A College representative
offered condolences, and
said “Imperial takes the
safety of its community
and those who work
closely with it extremely
seriously.”
Universities Minister
announces fines for
'no-platforming'
Jo Johnson, former
universities minister, an-
nounced plans on Boxing
Day to fine higher educa-
tion providers which fail
to protect free speech.
Johnson singled out
“safe spaces” and “no
platforming” as “under-
mining the principal of
free speech in our univer-
sities”, and set out plans
for the new Office for Stu-
dents (OfS) to ensure “a
clear commitment to free
speech” in universities.
Speaking on BBC Radio
4’s Today Programme,
he clarified this would
involve a range of sanc-
tions, including fines.
Johnson neglected
to single out individual
universities which would
come under fire from
the OfS, which is due to
receive legal powers in
April.
However, Johnson was
accused of misinterpret-
ing the issue by a number
of politicians and student
organisations. Angela
Rayner, the shadow
education secretary, said
the announcement was
“another meaningless
gimmick from a govern-
ment that has run out of
ideas”.
Johnson’s announce-
ment followed a number
of high-profile debates on
free speech at universities,
centring on visiting speak-
ers: two years ago, Cardiff
University students
launched a campaign to
prevent Germaine Greer
from speaking, citing
“hateful views” on trans
people. The talk went
ahead under increased
security.
New Year's Honours
for five Imperial staff
Five staff members of
Imperial were included
in this year’s New Year
Honours list, for their con-
tributions to educational
outreach, medical care,
and scientific research.
Helen Sharman, Op-
erations Manager for the
Department of Chemistry,
was made a Companion

and St George, for her
“services to Science and
Technology Educational
Outreach”. Dr Sharman
was selected for the
Project Juno space pro-
gramme in 1991, making
her the first Briton in
space. She was awarded
an OBE in 1992.
Professor Michele
Dougherty (Department

Christl Donnelly (School
of Public Health) were
both given CBEs for
their services to science.
Professor Dougherty,
who has just taken over
as head of the Department
of Physics, was the Prin-
cipal Investigator for the
magnetometer instrument
on board the Cassini
probe, which burned up in
Saturn’s atmosphere last
year after its 13-year-long
mission.
Professor Donnelly,
Professor of Statistical
Epidemiology at Impe-
rial’s School of Public
Health, was awarded the
CBE for her services to

ment on bovine TB, and
formed part of the World
Health Organisation’s
Ebola Response Team.
Professor Michael
Levin, Professor of
Paediatrics and Interna-
tional Child Health in the
Department of Medicine,
was awarded a CBE for
his services to medicine
and research. His research
group currently studies a
number of life-threaten-
ing childhood infections,
including meningococcal
disease.
Finally, Professor
Derek Bell, the Faculty of
Medicine’s first Professor
of Acute Medicine, was
awarded an OBE for his
services to acute care.
He was previously the
inaugural President of
the Society of Acute
Medicine, and is currently
President of the Royal

Edinburgh.
Professor James
Stirling, Provost of Im-
perial, said: “I extend my
warmest congratulations
to all of Imperial’s staff,
alumni and friends rec-
ognised with New Year’s
Honours. This is a richly
deserved recognition.”

London is set to
close the swimming
pool at St Mary’s
campus at the end of the

low number of College

The swimming pool,

doors on the 16th July,

online, the College said

four catering outlets, has
been expanded into eight
outlets, including the

restaurant, Queen’s Tower
Rooms, and the College
Café.
Justifying the trial, the
College claims over 80%
of catering transactions
are already cashless. A
College spokesperson told
Felix: “the cashless trial
has so far been received
very positively, and for
many customers has ac-
tually gone unnoticed…
early indicative results
clearly show that the use
of a cashless payment
method is quicker than
using cash.”
However, the trial has
been met with criticism
by students and staff. One
postgraduate student they
had stopped using College
catering as a result. They
told Felix: “I don’t under-
stand why Catering feel
they need to push out the
20% of transactions paid
with legal tender.” Felix
has also heard reports
of posters which had
been put up around the
Sherfield walkway last
December, criticising the
trial.
A College representa-
tive said the trial was put
in place “as a result of
feedback from students
and staff expressing dis-
satisfaction with lengthy
queue times in our outlets
at peak times.”
The College says the
trial will continue “into
January”, but has not
given a definitive end
date. Following the end
of the trial, an “evaluation
will take place following
the extended trial period
and any subsequent
permanent changes will
be communicated in
advance.”

The move has prompted
criticism from the pool’s
users, who told Felix that
little information had
been passed on to them – a
decision one staff member
called “quite shocking and
frankly offensive”. One of
the clinical lead doctors
at St Mary’s told Felix:
“Colleagues are upset
and angry. There are no
pools in the vicinity, and
the location is convenient
for most staff. The pool is
very well-attended, with
many non-staff users.
It’s an institution that has
been around for a long
time, and they have tried
to close it down before.”
Felix has also been
told that NHS staff who
tried to protest against the
closure were told “not to
make trouble”.

reduction in catering
options.
In a statement, an Im-
perial College School of
Medicine Student Union
(ICSMSU) representative
told Felix: "ICSMSU
regrets the closure of the
St Mary's pool, and will
work with College and
Imperial College Union to
ensure minimal disruption
to the student experience."
The 20-meter swim-
ming pool is open to
students, Imperial staff,
NHS staff, and members
of the public. The College
said the swimming pool at
Ethos, on the South Kens-
ington campus, would be
“available for all College
students and staff”. At
the beginning of this
academic year, College
announced plans to cut the
out-of-term opening hours

Professor Michele
Dougherty took over
as Head from the 1st
January.
P
rofessor Michele
Dougherty is
now in position
as Head of the
Department of Physics
at Imperial.
Professor Dougherty,
who joined the College in
1991, was made Professor
of Space Physics in 2004.
She was principal investi-
gator for the magnetome-
ter instrument used in the

which concluded last
September after nearly 20
years.

Weir, who was acting
Head of Department.
The department that
has faced a number of
problems with student
satisfaction: this year’s
national student survey
marked Physics as one
of the worst-performing
departments in terms of
satisfaction, with particu-
lar issues identified with
feedback and marking. In
the Complete University
Guide, Imperial is ranked
last for physics courses
in terms of student sat-
isfaction, while Imperial
dropped to 30th
in the UK
in last year’s Guardian
rankings, which are
heavily weighted towards
student experience.
Professor Dougherty
has been recognised by
the UK Science Council
as one of the top 100
living scientists in the UK,
and was elected a Fellow
of the Royal Society in
2012, after winning their
Hughes Medal in 2008.
She was made a CBE
