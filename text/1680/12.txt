New year, new music

017 was a year of
highs and lows for
the music world. In
a beige scene dom-
inated by Taylor Swift
and Ed Sheeran, we were
treated to rare glimpses
of colour from the likes
of LCD Soundsystem,
Kendrick Lamar, and
Arcade Fire. Some lived
up to expectations, some
exceeded them, and some
sadly did neither (sorry
not sorry). 2018 is sure to
be another rollercoaster,
so let’s take a small look
at what’s in store.
Arctic Monkeys
We don’t really know
much about this one
yet, but bassist Nicholas
O’Malley recently let slip
in an interview that some
recording has taken place.
And it makes sense: AM
was 5 years ago now and
frontman Alex Turner
and his new 70s hair have
finally stopped touring
with the Last Shadow
Puppets.
Vampire Weekend
Another one that’s
been quiet since 2013. A
new LP could be pretty
soon though, given it’s
supposedly been in the
works since January 2016.
Oh, and it might be called
Mitsubishi Macchiato.
Interesting. Watch this
space.
Franz Ferdinand
This one is more
certain. Out on February
9th, Always Ascending
promises a new, dancier
sound. And it’s accompa-
nied by a host of shows,
including at Brixton’s O2
Academy on February
24th. (Word on the street
is that Alt. Music Soc
are selling cheap tickets
tomorrow, but you didn’t
hear it from me).
Grimes
Back in the summer
Claire Boucher teased that
she was hitting the studio
every day, working on a
follow up to 2015’s Art
Angels. Far from the sun-
kissed twinkle pop of the
last album though, she’s
promised “chill vibes,
downtempo, synth-y shit.”
Well, I for one am excited.
Courtney Barnett
It was only three
months ago that we had
our most recent dose of
this Australian chill-rock-
er, when she teamed up
with long-haired layabout
Kurt Vile on Lotta Sea
Lice. But she’s itching to
go again, with a new solo
album already close to
completion, lacking only
a title. Thinking of one is
certainly a lot of pressure
you’ve got Sometimes I Sit
and Think and Sometimes
I Just Sit to live up to.
Frank Ocean
“5 albums before 30” he
declared in 2012. Well, as
of October 28th, that ship
has well and truly sailed.
However, Ocean recently
teased on Tumblr “Well
I made the album before
30, I JUST AINT PUT
THAT BITCH OUT!”
and with his reputation
of not releasing things
when he says he will and
then suddenly dropping
two albums at once with
no warning, anything is
possible.
David Byrne
A frequent collaborator
with the likes of Brian Eno
and St. Vincent, it’s been
14 years since the Talking
Heads frontman put out
a solo album. Always
one to buck the trend,
the non-ironically named
American Utopia is re-
portedly full of optimism
and positivity. Well, we
look forward to that ray of
sunshine bursting through
our blackout curtains in
early March.
They’ve only gone and bloody done it
A
s avid readers
of the Best
Music Section
On EarthTM
might already be aware,
The Gizz made a leg-
endary attempt to stick
five albums out last year
(the fourth of which,
P o l y g o n d w a n a l a n d ,
was reviewed herein).
We awaited with baited
breath to see whether
Stu & Co would deliver
their fifth - as the new
year approached, hope
dimmed to despair. But
our momentary lapse of
faith was misplaced, as
the band completed a
hail-mary album release.
“g’day [sic],” proclaimed
The Gizz on December
30th, “our new album
Gumboot soup [sic] is
coming out tomorrow.”
The album gets a lot
of things right. First and
foremost, a shoutout to the
rhythm section that kept a
tight groove pinned down
throughout the 44 minute
runtime; it sounds like
they were balancing on a
knife-edge. On top, there
are splats of synths and
nifty little flute bits sprin-
kled around all over the
place, welcome additions
to slower tracks that would
have missed the enriching.
This album also
suggests a technicality
that wasn’t present in
earlier Gizz works.
The intonation is more
delicate. The rhythms are
more precise. The compo-
sitions are more layered,
the band is tighter, and
the effort, overall, comes
off as much more mature.
This album drives home,
without a doubt, that King
Gizz hasn’t squandered its
marathon recording effort
this year, even if bits fell
flat. The band is better
off for having done it.
And yet, there’s a
problem with this album,
one that shows up on some
tracks more than others.
It’s like flat beer - there’s
nothing wrong with the
taste, but it doesn’t feel
right. As technically good
as the band feels (with
respect to their previous
work), the songs have lost
their mojo, like Austin
Powers in that one Austin
Powers movie. There’s
no hectic sense of fun
like on Nonagon, nor
is there the tongue-in-
cheek jokery that made
Paper Mache Dream
Balloon such a pleasure.
This leaves us in an
unfortunate position. The
band is writing some of
their best material, but at
the same time have lost the
vital spark that made them
so good in the first place.
They’ve traded the irrev-
erent energy for cold tech-
nicality, and that makes it
kind of hard to jump on
the hype train for this LP.
Are they tired? Have they
phoned it in? Is this legit-
imately their best effort?
To rehash a point that
ran in a previous edition
of Your Favorite Univer-
sity Newspaper©
, these
guys need some time off.
It’s summer in Australia -
they should hit the beach,
put their feet in the sand,
and forget about recording
for six months. Maybe
Buckethead can keep up
this frenzied pace; nobody
else can. And their fatigue
shows. To me, King
Gizz always sounded
like B52s on crack. This
album sounded like
CHON with a hangover.

feel right. ”
Sneaking it in on the final day of 2017, King Gizz complete their five albums in one year claim
A smattering of the releases that we in the Felix office are excited for in 2018
No one ever really thought they were still making
music together
Just before Christmas, Pharrell Williams and co. dropped their first full-length album since 2010. And with it, they
bring a whole host of friends including the likes of Kendrick, Ed Sheeran, and Rihanna.
A
fter the seminal
In Search Of...,
N * E * R * D ’s
o f f e r i n g s
throughout the noughties
were but a string of
disappointing releases.
As the collective fell
off everyone’s radar, its
most prominent member,
Pharrell Williams, began
his meteoric rise to
stardom, though Chad
Hugo and Williams would
continue to produce to-
gether as The Neptunes.
Menawhile, Williams’
work became synony-
mous with hit single after
hit single, year after year.
While he wasn’t working
on frivolous commercial
albums like Girl and
on film soundtracks
such as Despicable Me,
Despicable Me 2, and the
nerve-wracking conclu-
sion, Despicable Me 3, his
more discreet production
work absolutely took off.
As Williams’ and The
Neptunes’ resume of pro-
duction credits grew, they
presented some of the
most off-kilter, original
and creative production
the hip-hop scene had
ever encountered. They’d
transformed what would
otherwise be bland pop
songs, into something
dynamic and full of life.
The duo had carved them-
selves a place in hip-hop’s
history after producing
Clipse’s monstrous Hell
Hath No Fury, an abso-
lutely electric piece of
work.
Cut to 2017 and
Williams is now a house-
“The
production
on this album
is alive,
booming and
undeniably
fierce”
“Pulsating
with short
guitar stabs,
the track
explores dense
lyrical ground
regarding
police
brutality and
racial unrest,
a recurring
theme on the
album”
hold name. First single
‘Lemon’ is released out of
left-field with only sparse
cryptic marketing. And
not too long after, this
album is announced.
NO ONE EVER
REALLY DIES is striking
from the get go.The album
art is bizarre and strange,
vulgar and yet memorable,
with a woman donning a
foil grill, shot in a style
vaguely reminiscent of
Terry Richardson. The
production on this album
is alive, booming and un-
deniably fierce, exploring
new ground effortlessly
song by song. The album
blends the hardest, most
experimental shades of
hip-hop with the ethos
of pop music almost
seamlessly. Energetic
performances from a wide
selection of guest vocal-
ists, ranging from Gucci
Mane to Ed Sheeran (who
is surprisingly decent on
this) to Kendrick with the
highly varied production
and beat switches, make
for an engaging and ad-
dictive listen. The album
starts off strong, with hard
hitters like ‘Lemon’ and
‘Voila’ leading the way,
the latter featuring an
insanely catchy hook with
Gucci Mane. For the fifth
track, we are gifted with
‘Don’t Do It!’, featuring
Kendrick, arguably the
best song on this album.
Pulsating with short guitar
stabs, the track explores
some dense lyrical ground
regarding police brutality
and racial unrest, a recur-
ring theme on the album.
Tracks 6 to 8 are a
short lull. While there are
attempts to explore new
sounds and ideas, they
sadly fail to pay off in this
stretch. ‘ESP’ is generally
dull, poorly structured
and unable to be saved by
production; the same goes
for ‘Lightning Fire Magic
Prayer’, and ‘Rollinem
7’s’. The diamond in the
mud, however, is André
3000’s brief but fiery
verse.
Things pick up
again afterwards, with
‘Kites’, featuring M.I.A,
Kendrick, and some of the
most hypnotic production
on the record. The combi-
nation of M.I.A’s woozy
delivery and Kendrick’s
razor sharp flow is a
little jarring, but certain-
ly makes a refreshing
change from the stagnant
previous few tracks.
However, ‘Secret Life of
Tigers’ is Williams at his
most #woke, with lyrics
turning from an accessory
of the production to ob-
noxious and silly, making
it hard to take the song
seriously. This is all rather
unfortunate as the song
could have evidently been
so much more. The album
finishes with ‘Lifting You’
featuring Ed Sheeran,
where he isn’t absolutely
dreadful. Things end on
a relaxed and decidedly
limp note, with lax pro-
duction that sticks out in
the album, and not in a
good way, for it was the
more aggressive and edgy
production that really set
the earlier tracks apart.
Through several listens,
it has become evident that
we do indeed have a good
album over here, but its in-
consistencies stop it from
being a truly great album.
While most ideas are
original and new, some are
plagued by structural and
lyrical issues, Williams
often leaving much to be
desired, especially given
the difficult topics he tries
to cover. Despite all this,
the album is mostly enjoy-
able, and given some more
time, I reckon this album
will make its mark in the
future as quintessential
N*E*R*D.
