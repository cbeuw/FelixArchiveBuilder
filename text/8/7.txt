B .So . - A Warning.
There was a man of C. & G.,
( S o f t - h e a d e d as y o u ' l l a l l agree)
Who wooed a maid of " h i g h degree"
I n e n e r g e t i c f a s h i o n .
The maid - as maidens go - was c h a s t e ;
Not e a s i l y t o he embraced;
Could t e l l t h e diamond from t h e paste
And knew t h e P r i c e of P a s s i o n .
Romance I s n o t t o be p r e f e r r e d
To S a f e t y - as i s o f t a v e r r e d
(And o f t t h e S t o r k i s u n d e t e r r e d
By Impious I n v e n t i o n s . )
And so she s e t t h i s f i e r y gent
(She hoped perhaps t o thus prevent
Too premature a r a v i s h m e n t )
A t e s t of h i s i n t e n t i o n s .
She made him work b o t h h a r d and l a t e
At complex numbers and t h e s t a t e
Of S p i n d l e s W h i r l i n g a t a r a t e
Beyond a l l Computation.
He worked t i l l U n d e r s t a n d i n g r e e l e d .
The f i e r y t u r b i n e s round h i m wheeled
As lambs t h a t gambol i n a f i e l d
I n v e r n a l j u b i l a t i o n .
He s l e p t - and I n d i c a t o r s drew
Hugo diagrams t h a t grew and grew
And b a r k e d - as I n d i c a t o r s do
When Superheaters b i t e 'em!
He won h e r and y o u ask i f he
L i v e d ever a f t e r h a p p i l y
A l a s ! He's c h a s i n g Ph.D.
And so ad i n f i n i t u m !
