Yet another election
next week
Next Monday and Tuesday, you, as a member of Imperial Col-
lege Union, are entitled to vote in the fourth Presidential election of
the current academic year, and the second for the election of next
year's President and Secretary.
The last election, held in early March, was declared invalid since
only 540 people voted, a shortfall of nearly 500 from the necessary
25 per cent, minimum poll. Candidates for President were Simon A l l -
nut and John Herrick, and those for Secretary were R o b Armitage
and Roy Matthews.
This was the culmina-
tion of a disastrous year
for I C executive elections,
ever since Chris Sheppard
withdrew from College
last June. T h e first elec-
tion for his successor i n
October was a total fiasco,
when 833 out of a total
of 1100 voters abstained.
The second, where John
Lane was elected, was
short of the quota of 25
per cent, but the election
was declared valid by a
U G M desperate to avoid
further elections.
P R E S I D E N T
There are three candi-
dates for President.
R O B A R M I T A G E stood
for President i n October
would have got i n unop-
posed had R o y Matthews,
who was more interested
in training for Rugby than
contesting the elections,
withdrawn beforehand—
he only announced his in-
tention of doing so after
the election. R o b was last
year's R a g Chairman, and
is this year's External
Affairs Officer. H e is also
on the University of L o n -
don U n i o n S R C Execu-
tive. A third year Physi-
cist, he is a well-known
figure in the Union.
J O C K V E A L L , your loc-
al revolutionary party
candidate, is an "unalign-
ed member of the left"
with sympathies directed
towards the International
Marxist Group, led loc-
ally by a certain Piers
Corbyn. Although a hard
worker for last term's de-
monstrations and days of
action, he is probably bet-
ter known to members of
the union as one of the
prime perpetrators of the
"Letters from Heaven" i n
last term's issues of F E L -
I X . (His latest offering on
Church investment i n
South Africa appears on
page 8 of this issue).

are unlikely to have
heard of before, unless
you are in the U n i o n hier-
archy, i n Botany or Zoo-
logy, or lived i n Holbein
House i n 1970/72. A t pre-
Gordon Jackson Jock V e a l l
Paul Wadsworth
sent Bot/Zoo rep, he is
possibly the most interest-
ing candidate for Presi-
dent, since unlike the other
and previous candidates
he has no political con-
nections with the U n i o n
nor any affiliation to any
party, other than those
which occur at frequent
intervals in the U n i o n Bar.
His organisational qualifi-
cations come from being
a leading member of the
Holbein House Commit-
tee, and two years as Bot/
Zoo rep—he was almost
uncontested for the cur-
rent year.
S E C R E T A R Y
Three candidates again
for this post.
P E T E R G I L L E T T stood
unsuccessfully for Secre-
tary of the N U S at the
National Conference i n
Exeter this Easter, on the
Y o u n g Socialist Students
platform. H i s outbursts i n
Union Meetings are fam-
ous, and have become
progressively more so of
late as they have be-
come increasingly coher-
ent, articulate, to the
point, and sufferable. If
you agree that we should
force the Tories to resign
and return a L a b o u r gov-
ernment committed to So-
sialist policies, this is the
man for you.
G O R D O N J A C K S O N has
rocketed (almost literally)
to fame over the last year
or so through his hand-
ling of the Social Clubs
Committee. H e became
Secretary almost at once
upon joining, and the
Chairmanship followed a
mere blink of time later.
N o r m a n Sayles
H e has attained a reputa-
tion for stealthy efficiency,
and is a popular figure i n
the Union.
P A U L W A D S W O R T H is
this year's Ents Chairman.
Under his guidance, Ents
profits this year have
reached all-time heights,
exceeding £1500, and the
line-up of groups present-
ed each week has without
doubt been the best of any
college i n L o n d o n a n d
one of .the best i n Britain.
H e has a brash commer-
cial attitude, and it would
be interesting to see what
he would bring to the post
of Secretary . . . maybe
convert the whole of the
U n i o n building to a per-
manent Ents office??
(the election of the absten-
tions) and Secretary i n the
last election—where he
H e can claim consider-
able experience from his
Easter vac job as a dust-
