I.C. team
wins Tartan
Race
A team consisting of-two members each from City
and Guilds' U n i o n and R o y a l School of Mines U n i o n
were outright winners in their class in the Great Tartan
Race, run annually by Scottish and Newcastle Breweries
and promoted i n a December issue of F E L I X . T h e
race involves transporting M o r r i s M i n o r , accompa-
an (empty) keg of Tartan
beer from Edinburgh to
London, and the various
classes of entry are for the
most novel way of doing
this, the team collecting
most money for their no-
minated charity and for
the team completing the
distance in the shortest
time.
Both C & G U and
R C S U . entered for the
"collecting the most for
charity" section and the
I C team achieved a total
of about £1,150. R C S U
came fourth with £401.33.
The I C team made the
trip in a tartan-liveried
nied by tartan-clad dolly
birds, and collected for
A c t i o n for the Crippled
Child. R C S U , collection
for Imperial Cancer R e -
search Fund, were consi-
derably less resourceful,
utilising solely a rented
minibus driven in a man-
ner which surprised even
himself (sounds better than
"without due care and at-
tention", which is the
truth) by a certain M a r t i n
C. Black.
The Tartan Race was
entered by teams from
universities and colleges
throughout Britain.
John Randall
elected by
conference
as NUS
President
The Easter National Conference of the National
Union of Students took place at Exeter University on
April 2nd - 6th. Imperial College Union was repre-
sented by five delegates and three observers, viz: Rob
Arrmtage, John Lane, Trevor Phillips, Piers Corbyn,
Sonia Hochfelder, Michael Silverleaf, Peter Gillett
and Peter Lambert.
The Conference elected
John R a n d a l l as new pre-
sident of the N U S , to suc-
ceed Digby Jacks i n
August. John is at present
the Deputy President, and
his election came as some-
thing of a surprise, since
most people expected
M i k e Terry, N U S Secre-
tary and star of the occa-
sional I C U n i o n Meeting,
to win. Competition came
from, amongst others,
Piers Corbyn, who stood
on an IMG-type platform.
H e came second in the poll
— f r o m bottom.
Peter Gillett, another I C
delegate, stood on the
Y o u n g Socialists ticket for
National Secretary. A less-
contested battle, he never-
theless lost — but fared
better than any other Y S S
candidate in any other
election.
Major topics discussed
at the Conference were
Grants, the White Paper
on Education and G a y
Rights. F E L I X reporter

conference, will be writing

New Hall
unlikely to
be built
It now seems increasingly unlikely that there will be
a new hall built for Imperial College students in the
foreseeable future. The cost of the planned ten-storey
Northside Hall has now risen to a sum of the order of
£11 millions, as against the original estimate of
£500,000.
The College is faced
with the dilemma of only
being able to raise the ori-
ginal sum — and even
then they would have to
raise a l l hall rents to £5
per week i n order to pay
the interest charges due to
the bank on the money
they would have to
borrow.
There are several alter-
native plans. T h e most
feasible is probably to
still build at Northside (on
top of the swimming
pool) but to go for seven
instead of ten storeys. The
other main option being
considered by the Student
Residence Committee is to
build at Harlington, on
the College sports ground
—this would probably be
low-rise accommodation
similar to that at Silwood.
The main problem here is
the one that would be
faced by its residents —
that is, getting i n to South
Kensington. Harlington is
reasonably near to the
new Hatton Cross under-
ground station on the
Piccadilly line that will
open next year, but it's
still quite a journey.
Other alternatives that
were discussed at the last
Union Executive meeting
of last term were "bridg-
ing the g a p " between
Physics and Aeronautics
with a new hall—con-
sidered generally to be
rather impractical — and
conversion of 52/53 Prin-
ce's Gate and the remain-
der of Prince's Gardens
into a hall when Mathe-
matics, Industrial Socio-
logy and others move out
in 1975. It was agreed that
the latter conversion
scheme should be carried
out i n any case, subject to
the College agreeing to
finance the operation.
Unfortunately it is very
difficult to give a true pic-
ture of the situation. A t
present a l l discussion is
taking place within a
special sub-committee of
the Student Residence
Committee, and the
Union's representatives on
this, Brian Childs (Student
Residence Officer) and Ian
M c K e n z i e are keeping
quiet about what is hap-
pening — even to the ex-
tent of not letting the
president of the U n i o n
know what is happening.
The only certainty is
that, if a new hall is built,
it will be necessary to
raise the rents of all hall
rooms in order to pay the
interests o n the loan.
"Praise the
Lord and
pass the
profits"
The British Churches,
as most people know,
are run on very big busi-
ness lines. They cer-
tainly make money in
South Africa, that most
Christian of countries.
The Prime Minister Bel-
thazar Vorster and his
brother Dr. D. J . Vor-
ster, a prominent official
in the Dutch reformed
church are both devout
followers of Hitler and
stout Christians.
It would clearly be a
deplorable thing, how-
ever, and against Christ-
ian unity, if the South
African churches were
the only ones to make a
profit out of the African
and Indian population.
(The World Council of
Churches even donate a
few pence conscience
money every year to sup-
port African guerillas
from their fat takings
from their investments
in South Africa).
The Church Commis-
sion for England have
commissioned about 7
million shares in four
companies in South Af-
rica. These are: British
Leyland Motor Corpora-
tion, G.E.C., Metal Box
and Associated British
Foods. The market value
of these shares totals
£6.5 million. The total
current value of shares
Postgrads
furious over
demonstrat-
ing rates
Imperial College postgraduate students, disgusted
with the "rotten deal" that they are getting from the
college over demonstrating fees, are planning a strong
campaign to get a standard £2 an hour rate.
A t present rates vary
wildly from department
to department, and aver-
age at about £1 per hour.
Best off are those i n Phy-
sics, who are paid £1.40
an hour — including pre-
paration time.
PG's are especially
angry since the Govern-
ment declared in 1969 that
the average income of a
post graduate student from
demonstrating fees was
£160. They are asking the
college for a m i n i m u m of
£150 of work for any post-
graduate who wishes to do
demonstrating. A t present
only 4 4 % of I C P G ' s do
any demonstrating.
Other universities pay
much more than IC—for
example, Oxford and
Cambridge pay as much
as £3 an hour, and North
London Polytechnic pay
£2.35.
The protest is being led
by Post-Graduate Affairs
Officer Richard Mounce,
who is making representa-
tions to the Rector. The
only reason that strike ac-
tion is not being contem-
plated is the lack of
undergraduates to dem-
onstrate to i n the Summer
Term — and a protest of
this nature would have to
come in the A u t u m n term.
he claims were unconstitu-
tional and inquorate, is
now trying to invalidate
these elections o n the
same grounds. H e has so
far sent solicitors' letters
to the incumbent hier-
archy. Further develop-
ments are awaited.
Jock
McEwan
new ULU
pres.
The Assembly of Coun-
cils of the University of
L o n d o n U n i o n met o n
M a r c h 19th, and elected
Jock M c E w a n by a land-
slide vote as next year's
President. H e succeeds
Joy Clancy. Opponents
were T o m Halloren, from
the School of Slavonic and
East European Studies,
and Dermont O'Donnell, a
fiery character famed in
U L U , who comes from
Birkbeck College.
Jock M c E w a n is a 3rd-
year M e d i c a l student from
the Middlesex Hospital,
and is the first medic to
hold the post. During the
past year he has been Sec-
retary of the U L U Student
Representative Council.
Cathy Mortimer, Chair-
man of U L U Societies'
Council, was elected as
Deputy President. H e r
only opponent was once
again the redoubtable M r .
O'Donnell.
M r . O'Donnell, who has
previously attempted to
make much political capi-
tal out of the previous set
of elections, where he was
defeated by J o y Clancy
and M i k e Rosier, which
owned by British Church
organisations in South
Africa's big Corpora-
tions is £7.5 million. The
big attraction to invest-
ment in South Africa is
the cheap labour so en-
couraging fat profits.
The average black
workman today in South
Africa is worse off in
real terms than in 1911,
ie, Leyland South Africa,
11th biggest South Af-
rica company, paid last
year on average to its
unskilled and semi-
skilled coloured and Af-
rican labour £7 for a 44
hour week. G.E.C., the
biggest electrical engin-
eering group in the coun-
try pays Africans at the
generous rate of 10.7p
per hour or £4.81 for a
45 hour week.
Fifteen British church
organisations have got
their finger in the pie.
The Anglican, the Catho-
lic, the Methodist, the
Evangelist and the
Church of Scotland
amongst them. So rest
easy, we can pray to our
WHITE God (Jesus was
white, wasn't he?!) while
the profits roll in from
the black man's sweat.
