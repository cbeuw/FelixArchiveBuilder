NORMAN SAYLES
IT DOES MATTER
Hi, my name is
N o r m , I am standing for
President of IC U n i o n
for the c o m i n g year. I
feel I must begin by ap-
ologising for not seem-
ing to be a very active
candidate for these e l -
ections, but as I have
my Finals during the
first two weeks of term,
these being rather i m -
portant (I cannot be
President unless I
pass!) I am having to
spend most of my time
on revision.
The reason I a m
standing is clear to
those w h o k n o w me,
and I hope will become
very clear to the maj-
ority of students in IC.
I am an average student
and thus feel that I
w o u l d be a good person
to represent the college
in the capacity of Presi-
dent.
I have now been at
college for three years,
during w h i c h I have ser-
ved on C o u n c i l as Dept.
rep. from Botany/Zool-
ogy for the past two. I
was in Student House
for my first two years in
college, and w a s on the
house committee for the
final year. I have been
in digs and bed-sit this
year. Therefore, I have
a good idea of how the
college a d m i n w o r k s ,
and also have a very
good understanding of
how the normal student
at IC has to spend H i s
or Her time here.
During the past three
years, I have become
tired of seeing presid-
ents who have been very
little more than an ex-
tension of small but
p o w e r f u l political
groups w i t h i n the col-
lege a n d the channel
through w h i c h they
have w o r k e d . I have be-
come bored w i t h U n i o n
meetings a l m o s t every
week, and completely
fed up of seeing the
policy of IC being that
of the Minority, a n d
N O T of the Majority.
I believe the reason
why most people in c o l -
lege are disinterested
in the activities of the
Union is because of the
fact that although they
disagree w i t h certain
things w h i c h the U n i o n
is doing, they feel that
they have not the power
to make their feelings
k n o w n .
A way of overcoming
this particular p r o b l e m
is to have a President,
and Hon. Sec. who are
prepared to listen to
your ideas rather than
merely saying that your
ideas should be put for-
w a r d at a U n i o n meet-
ing. In m y opinion that
a n s w e r is not g o o d en-
ough. Y o u are now
thinking "great, if
Sayles is so bitter on
the mechanics of the
Union, what does he 'in-
tend to do about i t ? " I
will tell you quite
simply in spite of be-
ing told that this w i l l
never w o r k — I w i l l al-
ways endeavour to be
far more approachable
than others I have
known in places of
authority.
Naturally I have ideas
for the future of the
Union, the main ones
b e i n g : —
1 I think that we should
attempt to become
more of an autono-
mous body by c o m -
pletely taking over
and organising the
Union b u i l d i n g our-
selves. This means
that w e w o u l d be en-
tirely responsible for
the Lower refectory,
including the U n i o n
bar. There w i l l be op-
position of course,
but I personally k n o w
of several members
of the college a d m i n -
istration w h o I a m
sure w o u l d support
our takeover.
2 I believe that Imperial
should become more
active w i t h i n N U S , I
do not mean that w e
should follow en
masse all the propos-
als of N U S , thereby
c o m p l y i n g with their
every w i s h . In fact I
mean the exact O P -
P O S I T E . A l t h o u g h I
feel that N U S is a use-
ful body of students, I
feel that at the m o m -
ent, students through-
out the country are
being told what to do
by the N U S , but sure-
ly the situation
should be the other
way around, it should
be the students tell-
ing the N U S what we
want it to do I ! !
O w i n g to lack of
space, I summarise b y
saying if anyone wants
to ask me any questions
about the role of Presi-
dent I k n o w very little
about it at the moment,
but believe that the
learning of the job w i l l
begin once Y O U have
voted for me.
Help M E to help Y O U ,
Sincerely,
N O R M S A Y L E S
JOCK VEALL
The prime task for a
President is to demo-
cratically organise stu-
dents over specific is-
sues w h i c h they face
and not to irresponsibly
turn away from them
hoping they might dis-
appear.
Two of the more im-
portant problems w h i c h
confront us are a c c o m -
modation and cuts with-
in higher education (i.e.
grants).
ACCOMMODATION
Northside has not
been built and unless
w e begin to do some-
thing about it, it never
will be. (We will keep
paying the 35p volun-
tary levy into a fund for
a non-existent hall). A n -
other 1,200 students
are expected in the
South Kensington area
by 1976 so the situation
will not get better but
considerably worse. It
is not through paying
voluntary levies that we
solve our a c c o m m o d a -
tion problems. A n y loan
financing scheme at
best means money from
our pockets into the
hands of big property
speculators (are we af-
ter a higher grant to pay
bigger voluntary levies
to subsidise the r i c h ? ) .
M e a n w h i l e for the maj-
ority of us who are pay-
ing £5, £6, or £7 a
week for a place we
feel the pinch.
Thanks largely to the
property boom there are
more millionaires than
ever before in Britain
today. Even in the South
Kensington area the
property developers are
getting 2 | m i l l i o n
pounds of rate and tax
payers money as bonus
for completion, by the
end of 1 9 7 3 , of the lux-
ury hotels that only the
rich can afford to stay
in.
H o w at I.C. can we
face up to these prob-
lems? W e can begin by
working with many
thousands of other
angry tenants within
local tenants' associa-
tions. A t the same time
ICU must help meet the
immediate needs of stu-
dents, we must start up
organised squatting and
work with v a r i o u s
squatting organisations.
THE CUTS IN HIGHER
EDUCATION can al-
ready be seen at Im-
perial College with the
non-existence of any
future halls and the in-
troduction of self-fin-
ancing in the refectories
with the resulting in-
crease in prices and
cuts in portions. In
1 9 6 9 - 7 0 the College
authorities were allow-
ed to write off a loss of
£30,000 on the cater-
ing side. It is also no-
ticeable in some of the
ridiculous p r i c e s
M o o n e y charges in the
IC shops. These cuts in
education also affect
the catering and tech-
nical staff, the messen-
gers, cleaners, etc.
whose wages are kept
d o w n ; they are also
subjected to productiv-
ity deals, short time
work and redundancies
to cut costs. W h a t can
ICU do about it? W e
must organise to fight
against these cuts. The
more students involved,
A s secretary of ICU
there can be no better
choice than G o r d o n
J a c k s o n . That's my firm
belief; that's w h y I a m
proposing h i m .
S i n c e meeting h i m
on Hall Committee I
have been impressed
with G o r d o n ' s quiet
efficiency.
Having gained s o c i a l
colours for revolutionis-
ing S E A S o c and initiat-
ing Cultural Evenings,
Gordon started this year
with the strong w i l l
(necessary) to chair
S C C . A s in S E A S o c he
also doubled as an effi-
cient Secretary. S C C af-
fairs have appeared in
Felix too.
Politically central,
G o r d o n is not without
opinion. Reserved in
nature you w i l l not be
electing a b u r e a u c r a t —
N E V E R T H E L E S S H E

M y main role s h o u l d
be speeding up the im-
plementation of Union
Policies and keeping
members well in-
formed.
Some of the import-

that I can help a r e : —

A D E Q U A T E K N O W -
L E D G E of the intrica-
cies of the U N I O N or
C O L L E G E W O R K -
INGS. Hence they of-
ten do not become
involved.
Evidence: The n u m -
ber of people w h o
complain about the
Refectories, but do
not try a n d change
them, since they do
not k n o w how they
are run.

I intend to:

Union work.
—Improve the Blue

—Compile director-

— E n d e a v o u r to ob-

tract more people to

PAUL WADSWORTH
The H o n . Sec. is
elected by the members
of Imperial College U n i -
on to represent their
views to numerous bod-
ies and committees
both within a n d outside
the U n i o n a n d the C o l -
lege. I do not, therefore
intend to state a series
of promises. Instead, I
want to express my per-
sonal view as to w h a t
direction the thoughts
of the U n i o n s h o u l d dir-
ect itself next year.
PARTICIPATION
M o r e encouragement
should be given to the
U n i o n ' s members to
take an active part in
the affairs of the U n i o n .
For most of the year the
U n i o n ' s General Meet-
ings (at w h i c h , a c c o r d -
ing to the U n i o n Blue
Book, " t h e policy of the
Union on important is-
sues is r e s o l v e d " ) have
been either barely quor-
ate or, even worse, in-
quorate. For the U n i o n
to be really effective
more of its members
need to take part in this,
the most important of
its activities. This is a
Democratic U n i o n . Let
us direct its efforts to-
wards being more rep-
resentative of its m e m -
bers.
COMMUNICA TION
Last year's major
campaign slogan was
" c o m m u n i c a t i o n " . M o r e
c o u l d still be done to
improve the interchange
of ideas between the
U n i o n ' s members and
its Executive. F e l i x
c o u l d present more
material about U n i o n
activities. H o w rhany of
you know what de-
cisions have been taken
at C o u n c i l this year or
even at U G M ' s for that
matter? I understand
that S T O I C will get new
quarters in the M a t h s
building at present un-
der construction. Surely
this w o u l d be a g o o d
opportunity to w i d e n its
services.
ACCOMMODA TION
A c c o m m o d a t i o n is
still a major headache.
Even now Northside is
in danger of not beinn
built. This hall is vital
to the needs of we stu-
dents and we must c o n -
tinue to ensure that it is
built even if it may be
smaller than originally
planned.
FEE
T h e U n i o n fee is
£8.50 per student. T h i s
should be raised, not
only to cover the cost of
inflation but also to en-
able the U n i o n to ex-
pand both existing a n d
new activities.
This year sees the
appointment of the long
awaited A c a d e m i c Dir-
ector. The U n i o n must
start to work w i t h h i m
towards more flexible
courses w i t h the a i m of
increasing both the
chances and the scope
of jobs available to IC
graduates.
Please read the
bumph that I shall put
out. In it I'll explain
these and other points
more fully. I'm available
in the R A T T most din-
ner t i m s s if you w i s h to
discuss anything. If you
vote for me. Even if you
don't agree, still vote,
agree with me please
This U n i o n cannot af-
ford to have another in-
valid election.
Thank you.
P A U L W A D S W O R T H
the closer our ties w i t h then the stronger w i l l action of one form or
w o r k i n g people within be our position to fight another to ensure our
college and their U n i - back against these cuts, d e m a n d s don't go un-
ons, N U P E and A S T M S , by taking democratic heeded.
