PRESIDENT'S
COLUMN
Next Monday and Tuesday polling takes place
for President and Honorary Secretary of IC Union
and there are a number of compelling reasons why
you should sacrifice five minutes of your valuable
time to mark a ballot paper.
There is a w i d e spectrum of opinion a m o n g the
candidates a n d moreover anyone W h o w a s t h i n k i n g
of standing h a s h a d t w o months to make up h i s o r
her o w n m i n d . A President elected n o w w i l l have
a real chance to get the U n i o n into shape to get
his policies carried o u t .
He needs to get A L L h i s departmental represen-
tatives w o r k i n g — b o t h bringing up issues from h i s
department for the U n i o n to take up (as w a s the
case with the improvements in field course finan-
cing) a n d involving h i s students in i m p l e m e n t i n g
U n i o n policies (as a F E W d i d this year w i t h the
grants campaign). H e needs to be quite ruthless
in getting r i d of dep reps Who go to sleep a n d d o
nothing as several d i d this year. T h i s w o u l d be
one essential w a y of strengthening the union b y
stronger links w i t h the ordinary members.

sentatives w o r k i n g — b o t h bringing up issues from

nothing a s several d i d this year. This w o u l d be
one essential w a y of strengthening the union by
stronger links w i t h the ordinary members.
The second thing h e must d o is get his executive
w o r k i n g a s a T E A M . A s individuals the present
executive have made some useful contributions to
IC U n i o n a n d the Constituent College Unions but
w e have hardly w o r k e d as a team. T h e purpose of
an executive is to implement policy as d e c i d e d by
general meetings. O n this basis the whole of the
executive s h o u l d have responsibilities to IC U n i o n
unhindered by constraints from, say, a particular
C C U . T h i s term the height of absurdity w a s reach-
ed w h e n Rosemary Parker, President of R C S U n i o n ,
w a s constrained by her o w n executive from speak-
ing, voting or acting as she w i s h e d over the grants
campaign on a number of occasions, I say absurd-
ity because the actual members of R C S U were at
least as m u c h involved as any other C C U (if not
more so). B u t all it needs is a few demagogic, tiny-
m i n d e d reactionary s***-stirrers on a C C U execu-
tive a n d IC U n i o n Executive's effectiveness is great-
ly d i m i n i s h e d . T o achieve any advances for IC
Students w e need a strong IC U n i o n next year, not
a federation of petty w a r r i n g factions. Hopefully
next year's President w i l l see h i s task a s strength-
ening his Executive a n d resisting federalist tenden-
cies. •
A l l the indications are that the next Refectory
C o m m i t t e e meeting w i l l be faced w i t h proposals
for price rises. Probably " p o p u l a r " meals w i l l go
up less than others so that pie a n d beans w i l l b e
the order of the day for most of us next year. It is
the function of neither the Refectory Committee
nor the Governing B o d y to do a cover-up job for
the Government. F a r less is it the function of the
U n i o n . T h e blame for l o w grants a n d increased
prices must be laid on the Government otherwise
w e c a n hardly expect either grant increases or sub-
sidies. If i n spite of our opposition increases are
i m p o s e d then it w i l l be the task of next year's presi-
dent to lead the fight to get them w i t h d r a w n .
Early next session the n e w President w i l l be
involved in negotiations over the level of hall rents
for the following year. T h e government w i l l then
also be taking a d e c i s i o n on grants (the triennial
review plan), so h e w i l l have to renew the c a m -
paign a n d particularly involve freshers a n d inform
them of the issues at stake.
The danger is that if not enough people vote next
M o n d a y a n d Tuesday, next year's President a n d
Hon. S e c . w i l l probably not b e elected until the
m i d d l e of the first term next year. They w i l l be
faced with immense p r o b l e m s — h a l f the dept. reps
w i l l have disappeared, the Executive w i l l be doing
their o w n things, C o u n c i l will be ticking over in
very low gear a n d the College w i l l have already
taken the major decisions w h i c h affect us a l l .
Surely, w e a l l have the duty to give our sabbati-
cal officers a fighting chanec to make this a strong
effective u n i o n ! Elect them n o w — c o m e to the hust-
ings meeting, listen, question, read the b u m p h
sheets . . but, above a l l , V O T E O N M O N D A Y O R

Clje WLnion executive
I think the Executive w o r k s quite competently
with its present constitution.
It hardly ever meets anyway.

G o o d luck to everybody w i t h Exams.
LETTER
Sir,
I wish to make it
clear that the motion
proposing rent strike in
the last Felix, should
not have appeared un-
der my name. That my
name did appear seems
to have been owing to
a misunderstanding be-
tween the real authors
and you. I realise that
there can be no blame
attached to either party,
but this incident has
caused me severe em-
barrassment.
I would also point
out that I would never
propose such a move
without first gauging
the feeling in the halls;
nor would I call inquor-
ate EGMs. Any action
that we take at this
point in the Grants
Campaign must be suc-
cessful and decisive.
Any attempt at rent
strike for summer,
would be tactically dis-
astrous for ICU. We
should continue offering
"support" to the other
colleges on rent strike,
and prepare for one in
autumn, if the DES still
refuses to consider the
claim.
For the summer term
we should turn our at-
tention to other tactics.
"Work - ins", "Crawl -
ins", "Phone - ins",
postgraduate demons-
trating stoppages, are
all useful and generally
acceptable tactics. Ex-
ams are looming close,
but there still exist pos-
sible courses of action.
We must use every tac-
tic available and keep
the Grants Campaign
going.
Yours sincerely
TREVOR PHILLIPS.

man with his local corpor-
ation.
V O T I N G
Voting takes place o n
Monday and Tuesday
next, 7th and 8th M a y .
Ballot boxes will be plac-
ed, as usual, i n Southside
entrance hall, T h e J C R
College Block, U n i o n
Building entrance, a n d , if
you feel like making a trip
to Ascot to vote, at the
College field station at Sil-
wood Park. Subject to suf-
ficient manpower being
available, there will also
be a N E W P E R I P A T E T -
I C B A L L O T B O X — a n d
if you neither have a
Thesaurus, or dictionary
and don't listen to N o e l
Edmunds, we'll explain
what that means. Peripat-
etic means transient which
means itinerant, which
means it moves from
place to place. In this
case, it will open at ten
o'clock in the open air on
the college walkway by
M e c h E n g , move at noon
to the Ante-Room, C o l -
lege Block Refectory, and
close at about 2. The oth-
er ballot boxes are open
daily from 10 a.m. until
5 p.m.
Desperate for staff to
man these ballot boxes—
previously co-opted from
whichever mugs happened
to be i n the U n i o n Office
at the time (generally no-
body—there have been so
many elections this year
we've a l l got wise to the
game!), Martin (c) Black
has deserted the principles
of his faith and is offering
M O N E Y to those willing
to sit on ballot boxes, or
rather beside them. Pay is
£1 per session, a session
lasting from 10 to 1.30 o r
from 1.30 to 5.00. A s a
special offer, M C B '11 pay
£2 for a day and £4 for
both days. If you're inter-
ested, please go and see
him in the U n i o n Office.
The results—if a n y —
will be announced at the
Union General Meeting on
Thursday, 17th M a y . T h e
Deputy President and E d i -
tor of " F E L I X " , who are
elected in the same ballot
as the President and Sec-
retary, were returned un-
opposed earlier this year.
They are David Sinclair
and Alasdhair Campbell
respectively.
