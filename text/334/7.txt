A Fishy Tale
Sir, of all the topics
now occupying the at-
tentions of the media,
the Icelandic fishing dis-
pute is very much of a
second string to issues
like Northern Ireland
and the Common Mar-
ket.
Second string, that is,
in Britain.
In Iceland the 50 mile
limit is regarded as vital
to the survival of a
country that depends
completely on the fish in-
dustry, having no other
natural resources or raw
materials, thus no in-
dustry it can diversify
into. With such serious
implications the British
arguments against the
limit must be convinc-
ing; but are they?
Britain's opposition to
the limit is fourfold.
Firstly, Britain does
not recognise that there
is a conservation argu-
ment. Secondly, while
Britain appreciates that
Iceland is economically
dependent on fish, the
50 mile limit will have
serious implications on
the British fish industry.
Thirdly, Britain contends
that Iceland is in defi-
ance of International
Law. Finally the 50 mile
limit does not recognize
the traditional rights of
British fishermen to fish
Icelandic waters.
Iceland states that
there is a conservation
argument. In 1971 the
death rate of cod in Ice-
landic waters amounted
t0\70% of all mature cod
and 50% of immature
cod, of which 80% was
due to the fishing effort.
Also cod older than 10
years in the catch are
rare, whereas 15-20
years ago 15 year old
fish were abundant. This
means that fishing is
based on younger and
younger fish, so the
spawning potential of the
fish stocks is seriously
threatened. Twenty years
ago, cod spawned, on
average, twice a year at
least. Now, on average,
it is only once. The im-
plications are obvious.
Economically, B r i t -
ain's dependence on fish
amounts to approxi-
mately 0.2% of total,
employing approximately
0.5% of the population.
The figures for Iceland
are 81% and 20% re-
spectively. The catch
from Icelandic waters,
in 1971, amounted to
less than 12% of the tot-
al catch. A 50% reduc-
tion of fishing effort
would mean only a 6%
drop in catch, assuming
the fishing boats not
used in Icelandic waters
were not used else-
where. To imply, also,
that the British fishing in-
dustry cannot make up
the deficit on the seven-
teen or so other fishing
grounds used, casts as-
persions on the skills of
British fishermen.
Iceland is not break-
ing any existing inter-
national law by imposing
the 50 mile limit. The
U.N. General Assembly,
in 1972, passed a reso-
lution recognising the
rights of states to per-
manent sovereignty over
superjacent waters. Two
Judges involved in The
Interim Order, Padilla
Nervo and Mr. G. G.
Fitzmaurice, both state
that the 50 mile limit is
not contrary to Inter-
national Law. It is not
a question of Iceland
breaking the law, more a
question of Britain mis-
interpreting the law. Al-
ternatively, as Iceland is
breaking no law, Britain,
by ignoring the laws of
an independent sover-
eign state, is the only
law breaker.
'Traditional rights' is
the last argument Brit-
ain puts forward. We
have fished Icelandic
waters for 300 years.
Three hundred years ago
the fishing limit around
Iceland was 32 miles.
Recognition of the 'tradi-
tional rights' argument
is recognition of an ex-
tensive fishing limit.
A Iso when do 'traditional
rights' come before the
survival of a nation?
This then, is a sum-
mary of the British and
Icelandic case. We wel-
come the views of the
Student body and would
like to hear from any-
one who accepts the Ice-
landic case. Further in-
formation can be sup-
plied to interested par-
ties. We would urge all
those who agree with us
to write to their M.P.'s,
the national press, any-
one who could help in
getting this issue into
the public eye.
Only by open puolic
discussion will the Brit-
ish argument be reveal-
ed for what it is; self-
centred, shallow and in-
defensible.
Yours faithfully,
FRIENDS OF ICELAND

David Jarvis
