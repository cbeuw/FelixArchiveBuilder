the Virtual Stonehenge project
it will soon be possible to visit the
ancient site via the Internet. And as
long as virtual farmers don't mind you
walking across their virtual land there
will be no need to call the virtual police.
Brian Bath of English Heritage is behind
the project and sees a future which uses
immersive VR technology. "Visitors will be
able to don a headset and fly over the site
and land within the stone circle. By virtually
touching an object they will be given audio or
multi-media like visual windows, displaying
more textual and visual information". Features
may eventually include 'tactile feedback
gloves' enabling users to feel the texture ol
the stones. Smells, such as freshly cut grass,
may also be integrated into the system allow-
lti-sensory experienee.

A Geographical Information
System (GIS) is a powerful
computer package for all kinds of
geographic information. The
Stonehenge GIS was created to bring
together a variety of data that includes
base maps, contour data, aerial photogra-
phy, satellite imagery, road and landuse
information and the recorded archaeology
for the entire region. "Information on age
and condition of artefacts can be accessed
within the model using hypertext links", said
Bath. "These links are locations within the VR
landscape which can be clicked upon, present-
ing the user with additional information in the
form of text, pictures and sounds."
The system uses what is known as 'fading-
level-of-detail management'. "This means that
as a viewer 'moves closer' to a particular
stone other features leave his or her field of
view", explained Bath. "The computer grad-
isplays a model of that stone in ever
detail."
