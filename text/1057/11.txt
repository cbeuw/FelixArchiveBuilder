\bEA
I still remember the day I bought Massive
Attack's 'Protection'. I got home, put it on and
was utterly blown away by it] No other song had
ever had quite the same effect on me and just
thinking about Tracey Thorn's stunning vocals
made me shiver. Her voice was vaguely familiar
from the winsome, coffee-table angst of
Everything But The Girl, but that duo still passed
me by until Todd Terry's recent house re-working
of 'Missing', a song which became their biggest hit
and showed how well Tracey's voice was suited to
dance-influenced beats. Then came the vValking
Wounded' single...
Undoubtedly the highlight of this album, the
title track is an absolute classic. The heart-rending
lyrics are perfectly matched by their accompani-
ment of fractured beats, hard-edged samples and
sumptuous, flowing strings. This is provided by
Spring Heel Jack, first-rate exponents ofthe more
laid-back style of drum 'n' bass. But this song is
not just another remix - EBTG have gone Junglist!
Well, not quite. There are a couple of
acoustic ballads here, which are not really my
scene but are still excellent and will appeal to the
old fans. It is the break-beat tracks that really
shine through, though. Ben Watt, the other half of
EBTG, turns out strong melodies and his loops
and breaks complement Tracey's astounding
vocals to bring together a brilliant package.
Ironically, the weakest tune here is the Todd
Terry remix of the new single, Wrong'. The fine-
ly poised original is ruined by a bland house re-
working, a blatant attempt to cash in on 'Missing'.
It even starts the same way!
Apart from that, this album is simply mag-
nificent. It may be open to accusations of band-
wagon-jumping from those who say that break-
beats are everywhere, that everyone gets jungle
re-mixes (even Terry Woganl), that these re-
mixes even sell air-fresheners and deodorants, and
so on. However, this album is very much of its
time, as well as being innovative, hauntingly mov-
ing, and a genuine classic.
My album of the year, and it's only May! (9)
