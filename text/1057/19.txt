• The new measure under which
all students are forced to use one
single model of calculator, being
decided without much consulta-
tion or consideration of alterna-
tives.
• Last but not least, the Estate
Department's suggestion to
move the Union to Sherfield
Building so that Beit Quad can
be vacated for conference
accommodation.
Some of the above had been
reversed whilst the other are
already in place, but they all
point to the worry that students
welfare does not have much pri-
ority when Sherfield comes to
make policies that have great
impact on students. Is there a
communication breakdown, or
our opinion simply breached? It
is, after all, a university where
students are a big part of the
community and should never be
pushed around like some second-
class citizens. I believe it is up to
us to fight for what is good for us
and not just sit still and accept
mercy from others. It is our job
to make our voices heard, and
hopefully listened to, by the
those up in the tower called
Sherfield.

I could not agree with you more
when you say that 'it is up to us
to fight for what is good for us
and not just sit still and accept
mercy from other'. The problem
though is that you are not given
all the information with which
to fight. For instance, I suspect
that there was student involve-
ment in taking decisions over
calculators, but who knows -
maybe somebody might like to
inform us. Similarly allegations
have been made about the May
graduation ceremony, but since
there has been no responce from
College - are they true? The
point is that while those at the
top may care, the rest of college
does not.

my mother
My mother graduated last
Saturday. She had spent six or so
years sporadically doing things
called TMA's for the Open uni-
versity.
Her graduation ceremony
was in Belfast's Queens'
University Whitla Hall - a nice
enough building in itself, but the
sense of ceremony was some-
what marred when the various
dignatries and fellows walked in
to the processional theme tune
from Star Wars. Things had qui-
etened down a bit in time for the
guest speaker (Cedric Thorn-
berry, fresh from mediations in
Sarajevo]. But by the time the
Vice-Chancellor had come to
speak, the Lord Mayor's Show
had begun to parade outside, so
his discourse was drowned out
by Orangemen with bagpipes.
Afterwards, we went across
the road in the drizzle for cups of
tea in the Q U B Students' Union,
but when the guest of honour,
the Vice Chancellor and their
wives got stuck in the lift, it
rather put a damper on things.
The first graduation ceremo-
ny I went to was my brother's, in
Oxford. There was certainly no
lack of pomp and tradition. But
lengthy doses of Latin chanting,
and presentations that were
decidely reminiscent of Masonic
ritual, aren't everyone's idea of
the way to celebrate one's educa-
tion. I did the crossword.
So, on reflection, I reckon I
had the best deal. But I was still
fairly jealous of my mother
because she was so happy and so
proud. There was no cynical,
fatalistic, what-was-the-point-of-
all-that-effort for her. She knew
she had put in an enormous
amount work, and felt a real and
genuine sense of achievement for
it. I wonder why I never had
erratum?
I have been entirely over-
whelmed by the response I have
had to the editorial I wrote last
week, chiefly because I had no
idea so many people read it. I
would like to apologise to the
finance office: I assumed that
student grants came under their
jurisdiction, but apparently the
are actually administered by the
Registry division. I would also
like to say a particular thank
you'to the staff in Registry who
were so helpful with providing
the information for the article on
overseas students.
