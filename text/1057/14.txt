While you were stuck in smoggy
London dreaming of golden
sands, blue skies, fresh air and
suntans, the fell wanderers had
the good sense to visit the
Gower peninsula, and jolly good
it was too. The views from our
hostel, the old lifeboat station,
were pretty spectacular, and the
nearest beach was less than a
stone's throw away. Anyway, on
went the walking boots and we
set out to discover a bit more of
the coastline. The limestone
cliffs were scaled in a variety of
ways: the scramblers enjoyed
themselves on all the pinnacles.
Resisting the temptations of
umpteen fantastic viewpoints,
we finally settled for lunch on
the sand dunes of Rhossili beach,
a huge expanse of sand, which
was extensively rearranged by
Dave. Those of us who had
hoped to appear on TV in a 999
emergency were sadly disap-
pointed when Dave emerged
before his massive hole caved in.
The hole was then used to good
effect, housing Paul and Tim,
whose heads we were good
enough to leave unburied.
Following a long afternoon
of stile crossing, all we were fit
for in the evening was to collapse
in the lounge and 'play' Trivial
pursuit with no board, no coun-
ters and no dice.

tion: sea, sand and sandcastles.

Tonight, third world first come
along to our night of Roots
Reggae at the ICU, featuring live
music from 'Sound Rebellion'.
All proceeds will be going to
Christian Aid's campaign against
the International Monetary
Fund's structural adjustment
programme in Jamaica. This fol-
lows Angela Stultz Crawlle's lec-
ture in February on the subject.
In October, the IC Third
World First group will be host-
ing a Basic Rights Conference.
The focus of the event will be an
examination of Oxfam's recent
Basic Rights Campaign which
has argued that all poverty stems
from a denial of basic rights -
including for example food,
water and shelter.
OXFAM: Since the early
1980's the 'rights-based'
approach integral to the UN sys-
tem has come under attack from
a variety of directions. From the
Right, it has been argued that
the only viable rights are those
secured by consumers in the
marketplace - a perspective
which conveniently ignores the
fact that poverty excludes mil-
lions of people from exercising
'market choices'. And from the
Left and Right alike it has been
argued that since limited
resources make social and eco-
nomic rights unattainable, they
cannot be seen as rights at all.
This is at once sell-evidently
true and irrelevant since the only
existing obligation on govern-
ments is to secure that progres-
sive attainment of social and
economic rights 'to the" maxi-
mum resources available'.
If you are interested in get-
ting involved or simply airing
your views at this event please
contact Jon (x5976, j.parkin-
son@ic.ac.uk).

As such, we only have a couple
of events this term. The first is
the creation of our annual maga-
zine of fiction, articles and
graphics. We really would like
your material now, and the
deadline for knowing what we
are going to include (actual sub-
mission may be up to a week
later) is next Friday, 24 May.
For more info, see the web
pages.
The other event will be a
final book buy with any money
we have left - so suggestions
please. The library will be open
only on Mondays and Fridays
until the end of term, and
throughout the summer on a
request basis.
