Quttuso
After painting Crucifixion in 1942, with its thinly veiled
message showing the instruments of torture wrapped in a red
flag, Renato Guttuso was accused of blasphemy and
Bolshevism. He declared that "in this time of war and
massacres... I want to paint the agony of Christ as a scene of
today." Less than a year later he fled to Rome to join the
Resistance. His allegorical versions of contemporary events
that he painted whilst living under Fascism have made him
one of the key figures in twentieth century Italian art.
