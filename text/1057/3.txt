mourn Vic Turner
Security
V i c Turner, the well known and
much respected Imperial College
Security Supervisor, d i e d
suddenly in the early hours of
Tuesday 14th M a y . It has been
confirmed that he died of a heart
attack despite the best attempts
of his Colleagues, C a t h y a n d
Terry, and an ambulance crew to
revive him.
Starting work on M o n d a y
evening, he took his scheduled
break in the early hours of
Tuesday morning, going upstairs
from his post in the Sherfield
Building to the Senior C o m m o n
Room. H e was discovered w h e n
one of his colleagues later went
to inform h i m that they were
starting their rounds.
Vie had worked in College
for fifteen years, and was m u c h
appreciated through his contact
w i t h staff and students. H e
started w o r k as a Security
Officer stationed in the Physics
Department, later being trans-
ferred to Beit Q u a d where he
worked for over two years.
Vic then moved to the
Sherfield Building, after being
promoted to Assistant Deputy
Supervisor, where he was to
work for the next ten years. In
May 1992 he was again
promoted, this time to Shift
Supervisor, under the new shift
system that was then being
implemented.
Originally trained as a
butcher, serving an apprentice-
ship in Spitalfields Market, Vic
ran his own shop before coming
to Imperial College. His interests
outside work centred on his
family, to whom he was devoted,
and his keen in passion for
gardening.
The tragedy is compounded
by the fact that both his children
work at Imperial: his daughter
Mickie works in the Finance
Department as Business
Accounts Supervisor, and his son
Jason works in the Postal Section
of the Security Department.
Jason is due to be married in just
over two weeks time.
Vic's death came as a terrible
shock to his friends and
colleagues as he was only fifty
six, and had always been
extremely fit and active. His loss
to both the Security Department
and his friends throughout the
College is keenly felt, known as
he was for his forthright expres-
sion of views and his down to
earth nature.
He is survived by his wife
Pam, son and daughter. A book
of condolences is available for
signing at the security desk in
Sherfield. His funeral is expected
to take place early next week.

government inspectorate
charged with assessing the qual-
ity of teaching in Britain's
universities. Course completion
rates are not included this time,
but the number of international
students does constitute one of
the nine criteria.
Imperial scored a maximum
100 in the ranking of staff-
student ratios, with other high
scores being achieved in cate-
gories measuring employment,
research, and the number of first
class degrees handed out. These
figures pushed Imperial well
ahead of their nearest chal-
lengers with LSE and U C L over
fifty points behind.
John O'Leary, the
Education Editor of The Times,
suggested that this year's figures
are not exactly comparable to
last year's, due to the slight
change in scoring criteria. He
further went on to say that
Imperial College might hope to
narrow the gap next year when
the results of this year's research
assessment exercise are fully
incorporated.
