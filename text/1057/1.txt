IC still ranks 3rd
in Times league
BY ANDREW SMITH
This morning's Times newspaper
shows Imperial College retaining
its historical third place in their
annual league table of Britain's
higher level institutions. With
the Times using a number of
different criteria in this year's
scoring, Imperial has dropped
further behind Cambridge and
Oxford, now standing over 120
points adrift of the top two.
Once again both library
spending and accommodation are
the areas where Imperial suffers
in comparison to Oxbridge. IC
scores just 44 out of 100 in the
library category, while one of its
main rivals received maximum
points. The accommodation
ranking drags Imperial down
even further, with a score of 34
being well behind those of both
Oxford and Cambridge.
Commenting on the results
Sir Ronald Oxburgh, Rector of
Imperial College, refused to
draw comfort Irom Imperial's
consistent third placing. T want
us to be first' he said. But he
emphasised the arbitrary nature
of the Times selection of criteria,
saying that "we don't actually
think that tables like these are
very meaningful."
Justifying Imperial's poor
showing when library funding
levels are compared, the Rector
suggested that IC's mix of
subjects might be influencing the
score. He insisted that College's
library facilities are 'excellent',
and suggested that the large
number of scientific journals on
the Internet might lessen spend-
ing requirements in comparison
with those of universities special-
ising in the humanities.
Sir Ronald did not see any
immediate prospect of improving
IC's comparatively unfavourable
record on the provision of
accommodation for students. He
acknowledged that 'the rents are
high', despite the fact that
college subsidises them, and that
it is "hard to see any central
London college being able to
match Oxford or Cambridge."

IC's contractors Sclial International are set to begin sheet piling
next week around the perimeter of the new Biomedical Sciences
building. Having installed supporting structures to prevent any
subsidence of the RCS I chemistry building adjacent to the site, they
will dig out the site to a depth of 3.5 metres in preparation for exca-
vating the new basement. Meanwhile, across the, road excavation of
the the new library basement is well underway. Expected to take ten
weeks to complete, the drilling will provide extra archive storage
space so that the top floors of the library can be decanted while
building work for the extension takes place.
