Dear Rachel,
Issue 1056 dated 10 May 1996
The stall in this office are
rather upset at the inaccurate
accusations made in your editori-
al this week.
In the first place grant
cheques are not issued by
Finance Department, they are
handled elsewhere in adminis-
tration.
Secondly, Finance Staff are
encouraged to treat students
sympathetically. In most of the
contacts that .students have with
us, we are in the unfortunate
position of having to extract
money from them and only occa-
sionally do we have to hand
money out to them. W e all
realise that students are not gen-
erally well-off and do not have a
lot of cash to throw around, but
in life one does have to pay one's
debts and students are no excep-
tion to this rule. W e try to ease
the pain of it as much as we can.
Politeness and helpfulness cost
nothing except a little time, and
while I have to admit that time is
at a premium, I would be very
upset if I heard any of my col-
leagues acting in the way
described in your editorial.
• I hope that you will find the
space in your next editorial to
acknowledge that you managed
to mistake Finance Division for
another one.
Yours sincerely,
Brian Devlin
Credit Controller
Finance Department
You are just too diplomatic by
half, Brian. With regard to the
issue of grant cheques - Rachel
did mistake Finance for 'else-
where in administration', as you
so delicately put it, that else-
where being Registry.
I'm glad to see, though that
you basically agree with her that
the attitude that staff take when
dealing with students is impor-
tant. As you say 'Politeness and
helpfulness cost nothing except
a little time'. Now if only every-
body in College acted on that!

Dear Felix,
I read with great interest
your editorial on Felix 1056
'Unhappy People'. Many recent
issues lead me to think that stu-
dents welfare has been sacrficed
in the hands of college adminis-
tration. It seems a common con-
cept in Sherfield that decisions
are made based on their objec-
tive/convenience/benefit; consid-
eration for students are way
down on their priority.
Cite the new May graduation
as an example: it is indeed a good
arrangement to reduce the length
of the ceremony, but the invita-
tion and announcement is quite
poorly handled. Many invitations
were allegedly sent out late, some
graduates received the announce-
ment only by the middle of
March. This is rather short notice
for an event taking place on 1
May, and especially difficult for
overseas students who make up a
fair number of the postgraduate
population. And, in view of these
difficulties, there is no offer to
the absentee to attend the
October ceremony. (This should
really be an exception rather than
a rule. But considering effect of
the late invitation (see Felix 1055
'New degree ceremony 'low
key'), perhaps the College should
consider a more flexible approach
as a gesture of good will?)
Another example literally
daunts on me when I walk pass
the central library every morning:
How can it be justified that con-
struction work on the library
extension has to start in May,
when most of the students are
using the library to prepare for
their final exams? Is it not appar-
ent that the noise level is a big
nuisance to say the least?
Other examples include:
• The proposal of replacing the
Union bookstore with one run by
an outside business, thus replac-
ing a Union service that has
