IC favoured
on overseas
'whitelist'
BY THE NEWS TEAM
IC's £13.8 million income from
foreign students was put under
the spotlight this week with the
revelation that some countries
are creating 'whitelists' of
favoured British Colleges.
The Education Editor of
The Times, John O'Lcary, broke
the story early this week. He
confirmed to Felix that Imperial
is on the exclusive list of colleges
to whom Singapore will send
medical students. It has also
been confirmed that all
Imperial's degrees are accepted
by Singapore's Professional
Engineering Board.
Prof Alan Swanson, Pro
Rector (Educational Quality),
suggested that Imperial's exalted
position might in part be due to
the long running activities of the
College's International Office.
Their efforts ensure that
Imperial is represented at all
major Recruitment Pairs that the
British Council runs worldwide.
At present approximately
23% of Imperial's student popu-
lation originate from abroad.
Malaysia, Singapore and Sri
Lanka are the three best repre-
sented countries, with over six
hundred students.
The Pro Rector defended
the relatively high number of
overseas students saying that
"The international experience is
part of why people come here."
He suggests that the increase in
overseas students is likely to
continue with 30% being a
"reasonable" upper figure.
This means that the valu-
able overseas income will
continue to grow, potentially
topping £20 million by the end
of the decade. This was the first
year that income from cwerseas
students surpassed that from
home students. With this signif-
icant source of money depen-
dent on the approval ol foreign
governments, Prof Swanson
admits that he would be
concerned, "if we were crossed
off anybody's list".
£40m Albert Hall windfall
BY NAT BARB
Popular science shows, sports
events and a British Orchestra
Week will feature in the new
programme of the Royal Albert
Hall, following its £40 million
award from the National
Lottery Fund.
Announcing the award on
Tuesday, the Hall's Chief
Executive, Patrick Deuchar,
explained that the money will go
towards a £58 million refurbish-
ment project which will take
around eight years to complete.
"We want to restore and up-
grade the fundamental fabric of
this Grade I listed national
monument for audiences and
artists alike", he explained.
Mr Deuchar intends to
balance the range of events at the
Royal Albert Hall, but with the
new facilities he hopes to be able
to stage an additional 60 shows
each year (at the moment there
are just over 300). The original
remit of the Hall was: "to
promote the arts and the
sciences", and talks are underway
with the Science Museum to
bring in science shows. This
move follows the great success of
the recent talk given by Stephen
Hawking. M r Deuchar is also
considering expanding into sport-
ing events such as gymnastics and
basketball and also dance and
opera.
This is award represents yet
another massive lottery grant to a
London institution, though M r
Deuchar though does not feel
that only Londoners will benefit.
He views the Albert Hall as "the
nation's village hall", and envis-
ages that events such as the
proposed British Orchestra Week
will bring all of Britain together.
Development work is
already underway with the
upgrading of seats in the balcony
to dress circle standards resulting
in the hall being shut for a
month. The other most notice-
able cfianges will be a pedestrian
piazza right around the building,
and a rebuilt South Porch which
should match the other three
grand entrances. A huge under-
ground service yard beneath the
South Steps will be constructed
to remove traffic from around
the building. Other plans include
the building of additional bars
and restaurants to relieve the
present overcrowding.
It is hoped that disruption
due to the building works will be
kept to a minimum with only two
additional closures. The first will
occur in 2001 to revamp the
stage, with the other closure at
the end of the works to clean the
organ (at a cost of £2 million) and
to refurbish the interior of the
Hall. The £ i 8 million balance
between the cost of the project
and the lottery grant will be met
from Royal Albert Hall trading
surpluses.
1996 is the Royal Albert
Hall's 125th Anniversary. This
£40 million 'birthday present'
should allow it to maintain its
image as one of the nation's most
popular venues well into the next
century.
News in brief
Unusual interest in AGM
Filling the I C U officer vacancies
looks set to be a simpler than
usual task this year. As Felix
went to press, the positions of
transport officer and Haldane
Book and Record Buyer were the
only ones lacking candidates. The
elections are due to take place at
the Annual General Meeting
scheduled for 12.15pm today.
The position of Council Chair is
hotly contested, with both
C & G U President, Sarah Thomas,
and Vice President, Duncan
Tindall, standing for the position
as well as the Royal College of
Science Academic Affairs
Officer, Matt Szyndel.
IC 'in hock to military'

figures released by the Campaign

vast majority of IC departments
receive M o D funding, whose
contracts are supposedly worth

Government sponsor $3.5million
worth of military research.
