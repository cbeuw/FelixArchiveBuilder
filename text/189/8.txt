I.C. TROUNCE READING
The Boat Club won all four races against Reading University
during the annual fixture on March 2nd. The course at Reading
was a pleasant two-mile stretch of the Thames, finishing below
Caversham Bridge.
The 3rd VIII had to fight hard in the early stages of their race,
the crews were still level after two minutes when I.C., rowing with
a steadier rhythm began to draw away and finally romped home to
win by 7 lengths.
"Alpha," the fastest I.C. novice
VIII, were a little over-confident
and Reading, rowing at a higher
rate, managed to snatch an early
lead of \ length. The weii-drilled
I.C. crew then drew slowly ahead
to finish with a lead of If lengths.
" Beta " scored an outstanding 9
lengths win. Reading were never
in the race and the I.C. crews did
well to drive themselves hard
over the course.
Three members of the Reading
1st VIII were ill so that the 1st
VIIFs race had to be cancelled.
There can be little doubt that I.C.
would have gained another con-
vincing win in this race. In the
all-important 2nd VIIFs race, a
good start by I.C. gained \ length
in the first minute. This gap was
rapidly widened to 2 lengths
which was maintained until near
the finish when a final burst at
36 made the verdict 2\ lengths.
During the afternoon B. Vieri
won a sculling race, so that I.C.
superiority was complete.
This fixture was the first com-
petitive event of the year, the re-
sult was a welcome reward for
the months of hard training
during the winter.
A more accurate guide to form
will be the Head of the River
Races later this term. The club
has a full programme of regattas
for the summer term and expects
to do better than ever.

IMPERIAL COLLEGE, 1st
RETAIN DIXON BOWL
FX T H E U.L. H E A D
from the FELIX Rowing corres-
pondent
I.C.B.C. followed up their suc-
cess at Reading by retaining the
Dixon Bowl in the U.L. Head,
awarded to the fastest University
of London College crew over the
mile course from Mortlake to
Putney.
Twenty-three crews took part
in the Head, which was run in
windy conditions on the after-
noon of Wednesday, 5th March,
I.C.B.C. entering nine crews. The
first eight home was the U.L. II,
which does not qualify for the
Dixon Bowl, hotly pursued by
the I.C. I, which came in at 19
mins. 52 sees. I.C. crews also
took 2nd and 4th places, and the
first novice crew came second in
the maidens division, only 27
seconds behind the winners,
Kings II.
There were several surprises in
the final placing: it was realised
that the I.C. I l l crew had beaten
I.C. II to the finish by 6 seconds.
The much mocked Gentlemen's
Eight showed their mettle by
pulling up from their starting
position of 20th to 11th, with a
time only four seconds slower
than the I.C. IV — quite credit-
able when it is remembered that
they have not had any regular
coaching, and have been rowing
regularly as a crew only this
term.
The only cloud on the horizon
was the navigational error on the
part of the second novice crew at
the end of the course, which re-
sulted in their coming in close
contact with one pier of Putney
Bridge with rather disastrous re-
sults to the front end of their
boat.

THE DUTCH T A K E ON ICWA
During the first week; of the
Easter vacation, a team of
ICWArians is visiting Groningen
and Urrecht Universities in Hol-
land. The keynote of the tour is
variety, and a party of twelve will
play the Dutch teams at sports
including swimming, badminton,
table tennis, hockey and squash.
The following have accepted in-
vitations for the tour : J. Brown,
J. Brownlee, M . Bullock, M .
Jones, B. Leslie, B. Milner, F.
Oestreiches, M . Pleaden, Dr. E.
Rhodes, S. Stapley, A. Sutherland
andK. Tait.
The team is particularly strong
in squash and tennis, and shouH
give a very good account of itself
in these events, and should pro-
vide keen opposition in the other
events. A few of the team will
be competing in several sports, so
that it looks like being quite a
strenuous tour.
Departure date is the 24th
March, and the team plan to
spend a week in Holland, where
they hope to combine sport with
a full social programme. It is
expected that the result will be
a most enjoyable tour and a
boost to women's sport in the
College.

ICWA VICTORIOUS A G A I N
The ICWA team won the an-
nual pancake race round the
quad, mainly due to the lack of
opposition from their opponents,
the Executive. President Oldfield
lost his pancake, President Little
his trousers, Secretary Preece his
umbrella, and President Chand-
mal his NUS card. A l l credit,
however, to ICWA for the brave
way they submitted to ordeal by
water deluge and water bomb in
order to reach their goal. A
record number of pancakes were
subsequently consumed on the
3rd floor. Your correspondent
was assured that ICWA did not
train on curry.
BRIGHTON—
A N D WE BURST
At midnight on Saturday, 23rd
February, eight hundred (?) souls
gathered on Westminster Bridge
to walk to Brighton and show the
world that the British nation was
still capable of walking. Among
those present were twelve IC
representatives, seven of these
being from first year Metallurgy,
most of them sporting " Freedom
from Hunger" posters and as-
sorted clothing. Two of these
travelled all the way in the sup-
porting car, their chief duty being
to brew tea in obscure places for
the next 54 miles. The remaining
ten were all walkers, that is, to
start with at any rate.
Of the ten, one dropped out
with blistered feet at the first
.check-point,1
joining the tea brew-
ing party in the car. Another one
retired with sore feet, and two
more dropped out before the
third check-point and were not
seen again. The last one to give
up was seen from the car walking
in the wrong direction—his knee
had gone stiff, and this presum-
ably resulting in his turning
round.
The remaining five won
through to the 50 mile check-
point, and three of these entered
Brighton to roars of applause
from assorted sadists and their
car travelling colleagues. Those
who had failed vowed in a
moment of foolishness to try
again. In any case, the IC men
could claim a 50 per cent, suc-
cess—-the British Army could not
even claim this much. Of a party
of eleven from the Royal Signals,
only one made it to the finish.
This could be an indication that
the average student is somewhat
fitter than the Army.

Merrie England is green again,
and soccer players are wearily
emerging from their igloos pul-
ling ham strings, muscles and
fingers out in order to achieve the
fitness weight of last term.
The first games of the restart
were the U.L. Cup matches in-
volving the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th
and 7th XI's. Only the 1st and
6th XI's survived this plunge into
the deep end, the former travel-
ling to Sidcup on Sunday, March
3 rd, to meet Goldsmiths' College.
T.C. were.not at full strength and
their optimism was not increased
by the large number of opposi-
tion supporters.
As expected the game started
very fast, both sides fighting for
an early goal. With Basil James
back at centre-half, the T.C. de-
fence efficiently broke down early
Goldsmiths' attacks, each time
the ball being thumped out hard
to either wing. These tactics soon
paid off when Colin Casemore
raced down the right wing and
sent across the ball hard and low
to Alex Crawford who ran it into
the net. T.C. then took advantage
of their position and continually
pressed the slightly demoralized
Goldsmiths' defence. After 45
mins. I.C. were three up, Case-
more having scored from a nar-
row ang'e and Crawford just
eluding the goalkeeper from the
edge of the area.
With nothing to lose. Gold-
smiths' started the second half in
very vigorous form, but the I.C.
defence calmly held them in
check safely backed by Dave'
Loftus in goal. In general I.C.
were superior throughout the
second half, but a stalemate
seemed to descend upon the
game. The fighting spirit de-
parted from the home team and
T.C. were contented to retain their
lead.
Tn the League the 1st, XI re-
cently beat Goldsmiths' 5—1 thus
easing the relegation danger. The
2nd X I continue their success at
the top of Div. I (R) and the 4th
and 3rd XI's at the top of Div. II
(R) have strong promotion hopes.
The 5th, 6th and 7th XI's all lie
second in their respective Divi-
sions. The 7th X I , captained by
Ant. Jones, are worthy of special
mention, experiencing a very sue?
cessful first League Season.
