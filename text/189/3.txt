"Let us not," he asked, "dissi-
pate our energies in an ocean of
sterility."
SUMMING UP
Stacey vs. Chandmal
Mr. Stacey employed the
smooth second-hand car sales-
man delivery in his summing up ;
again a masterly performance,
but a trifle impudent perhaps to
refer to Mr. Chandmal's so-
polished technique. Mr. Chand-
mal used his own inimitable
method in ridiculing each opposi-
tion speaker in turn. This, as
always, was beautifuly done, but
while we were marvelling at his
superb oratory we tended to for-
get the real issue at stake. Of
Stacey he said : " A n army of at-
tractive phrases booming over the
landscape in search of an idea."
His main claim was that IC could
come to no harm in NUS,
LESS INTEREST
FEWER VOTERS
It may be that the Union is
losing interest in the topics of
NUS. Certainly less persons
voted. Now that a decisive vote
has been taken it is hoped that
the dead horse will be allowed to
rest for a few years. It has been
an interesting term.

After our very popular scram-
bled edition the other week,
falsely rumoured to be of foreign
origin, we have sobered up and
are back to normal. Last week
we had intended to report on the
Engineer's Dinner and Dance but
we were still recovering at the
time of writing as our efforts
proved. If Mr. Pawlowicz con-
descends to publish our account
this time you will be able to dis-
cover what happened and if not,
you cannot complain, tickets
were available. A red and white
striped perambulator was found
in Master Micky Harries room
last week by the cleaners. Was
his affair a mistake or did Hock-
ing have anything to do with it?
Last Thursday saw the third
Guilds Union Meeting of the
year. When the President offi-
cially opened the meeting he was
saluted by a fly past of some 100
light aircraft. After the customary
pillorying of the secretary minute
after minute, congratulations
were extended to the Radio
Society and yet again to the
Motor Club for their recent suc-
cesses. In view of the gravity of
the situation of the past three
weeks and the severe financial
stresses under which I.C. Union
might find itself, a motion was
proposed that the President of
Guilds should set an example

and use a cheaper convenience,
sorry conveyance. The obvious
choice was a perambulator.
Tweedle Carter and Dum Austin
proposed the motion pointing out
that the President was at the age
where he was unable to distin-
guish between male and female.
This they claimed was shown by
his continual reference to " Bo "
as she. Did any person present,
they asked, know of a girl with a
clutch, crash gears, a capacity of
two litres and who still went to
Brighton at the age of 61. Two
experts on structures proved that
the structural problem was diffi-
cult. The chairman of the debate,
J. B. Preece, then allowed Mr.
Liddle to put forward his defence,
namely that the Union could not
afford to support both himself
and a perambulator. Two techni-
cal experts from the Ministry of
Perambulation were called in to
give advice on the bye-laws rele-
vant to the case. The debate was
then thrown open to the meeting
whereupon many incensed per-
sons, aired their irrelevancies.
Mr. SlaCey in his rhetorical sum-
ming up demonstrated his ina-
bility to grasp the facts of life.
No one was in any doubt as to
which way they should vote and
in order to prove the vehicle fit
for the road and water a posse
transported the President to his
Mecca, the Queens.
Lately it has come to our
notice that Guilds took part in a
pedal car race in which they fin-
ished the course despite limited
time available to make their car.
Guilds also sent a deputation to
Brighton in answer to President
Kennedy's urge to all future exe-
cutives to walk 50 miles a day.
GUILDS UNION MEETING
Last Union Meeting of this term:
Thursday, 14th March
Room 542 Mech. Eng.
at 1.15 p.m.
A career

If you divide the population into two groups—those
who take T H E TIMES and those who don't—you find
this: those who don't take T H E TIMES are in the great
majority. Those who do are either at the top in their
careers, or are confidently headed there.
T H E TIMES both by its seniority in experience and
by its incomparable prowess as a modern newspaper,
naturally commends itself to successful people. There
is no high level conference, no board meeting, no top
executive's private office into which T H E TIMES is
not apt to be taken.
This choice of a newspaper by people who get on is
indisputable.* In which of the two groups do you
place yourself?
