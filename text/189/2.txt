UP TO NO GOD
I feel that many of you will not
have understood just why you
must follow Father Ivor's simple
suggestions so I thought a few
words of clarification would help.
I must say straight away that it
is not in order that you may
spend forty days tempted 61
Satan. Sorry, but there it is. Do
you like our snappy slogan,
"Limbering up for Lent"? Of
course we cannot afford the big
agencies yet but the time will
come . . . . .
Let us look at suggestion (1)
"Private Prayer to be regular,
morning and evening." Well, this
is good sound stuff, but if it does
not work, try a laxative. Sugges-
tion (2). . . yes . . . May I expand
a bit on this New English Bible
business? We felt that the Gram-
mar Schools were getting a little
behind in Bible reading mainly
because they couldn't so we got
some chaps together (who hadn't
even seen a Grammar school,
actually) and told them to talk
down but with dignity so out
came this new thing and of
course the people love it. Helped
to sort out the wheat from the
goats among the clergy too.
(3) Next, I think the greatest of
God's gifts to man is the Free
Will to come to Church and it is
your bounden duty to come and
thank Him for giving you this
choice. We will pass on to num-
ber (5) now because self-denial is
paramount in Lent. A few hints
on how to get away with self-
denial in company; I have found
that "Doctor's orders," "Throat
trouble" or "Just had an opera-
tion" are invaluable cover-ups
against pagan curiosity. What's
next? Oh yes; Almsgiving, as
Father Ivor says, this is an inte-
gral part of self-denial especially
as one has to wait so long for the
Thanksgiving. We do not mind if
you give the money to charity.
And lastly number (7). Well,
being a gentleman and an evan-
gelist is a little difficult but some
diplomacy and some One-up-
manship (we call it Holier-than-
Thou) should help to bring other
sheep to the fold. Do make sure
they are sheep, it saves so much
trouble with the newspapers.

COLCUTT
So we are out of NUS. Hooray !
Mr. Combes seems to be as in-
consistent as I am on this issue,
but now I have finally made up
my mind. I've joined the win-
ning side. NUS is not worth
£300 to ICU. I was rather dis-
appointed in the President's
speech—he said nothing. In his
first speech he implied that IC
has money to burn and that the
ACC is squandering money on
beer. He knows this is not true,
but I suppose it is fair debating
tactics to say so if you can get
away with it. In his summing up,
he glibly described Stacey as
being glib, and Gardiner as sin-
cere. It is a pity that he was not
more sincere himself- It is all
very well advocating IC repre-
sentation on outside bodies, but
how often does he represent IC
in U L U Presidents Council ?
Last week was U L U Rag Week,
but I'm afraid that IC did not
make any real contribution.
Surely we could have organised
some sort of stunt with all this
spare administrative talent that
we are supposed to have ?
Perhaps ICU is not all one
cracks it up to be. I hope that
we do better in our own Carnival.
IC hops have not been too
good lately ; attendance seems to
have been dropping. Is it the
bad weather, the lack of pub-
licity, or the " undance-able to "
jazz bands that have kept the
birds away, or is it the unsocial-
able atmosphere induced by the
large groups of men at the back
who just stand and stare. What-
ever the reason, it is high time
something was done to re-estab-
lish the IC hops as the best in
town.
LETTER TO THE EDITOR
Dear Sir,
Do we really have to put up
with reading the tasteless rubbish
published in " Auntie Lopes"
column ? The elegant ladies of
ICWA must be rather tired of the
old, so called " jokes," pushed at
them by the obviously sex-starved
compiler of the column, and most
students at I.C. with an I.Q. over
60 are not interested in Mr.
Alison's wild oats. (See column in
the last edition of "Felix")
If this literary abortion must re-
main can 1 steal a thought from
TWTW and suggest a more real-
istic title — " That was the wit
that wasn't."
Yours faithfully,
K. HOCKING,
Botany 3.
