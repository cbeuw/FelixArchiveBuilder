NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION
No. 189 Wednesday, 13th MARCH 1963 PRICE 4d.
NUS MOTION DEFEATED
The Second debate this term over the N.U.S. issue was held
in the R.G.S. hall last Thursday, March 7th, and the motion " that
this College join NUS " was defeated by 315 to 254 with 14 absten-
tions. The debate might have been an empty anti-climax, or it
might have become a dull repetition of that which went before. In
fact it was neither; it resolved info an exciting and humorous flow
of rhetoric and occasional sarcasm. The opposers considered the
proposers irrelevant while the latter claimed the former were slan-
derous. The result was an hour's delightful entertainment.
TWO MOTIONS o n e a s s m a l l m m d e d a s t h e othe,.
CONSIDERED
PRESIDENT PROPOSES
The meeting opened in danger
of sinking in its own mediorcrity.
Two motions were put forward,
CONTRATULATIONS,
MR. PRESIDENT!
This year the Sir Arthur Acland
English Essay Prize was awarded
to Mr. A. Chandmal for his essay
" The Prehistoric Cave of Las-
caux."
This is probably the first time
the award has been made to the
President of the Union and the
examiners made special mention
of the high standard achieved.

and Liddle's pedantic proposal to
change the wording of the motion
was admirably dealt with by the
Chairman. The President va-
cated the Chair, and though in
bad health spoke eloquently say-
ing that the executive would cer-
tainly be able to deal with the
extra work involved.
Mr. Gardiner layed about NUS
in terms which Mr. Berry de-
scribed as slanderous ; only the
staff, he claimed, would suffer
were NUS to disappear.
" TURGID RHETORIC "
" JOIN T H E BOILER
M A K E R S "
Mr. Liddle described the NUS
council minutes as 150 pages of
turgid rhetoric and waving a
great deal of paper endeavoured
successfully to ridicule the
motions before said council. Mr.
Harris implied that we might
as well join the Boiler Makers
Union as NUS, and amidst a
great deal of laughter told of the
unfortunate " Soe Joak" who
was supporting us all at College.
" UNHAMPERED BY FACT "
" NUS OCEAN OF
STERILITY "
Mr. Turner in a characteristic
style pleaded that the opposition
had unfair advantage, since they
were unhampered by fact; fur-
ther, the whole thing amounted
to a monstrous slur on NUS. In
perhaps the best received speech
of the day, Mr. Watson applied
biting sarcasm to good effect. Re-
ferring to NUS as the wonder
cure for Mooneys' meals, he said
that the first fruits from the
golden bough would be £300

G E N E R A L STUDIES
Harold Wilson
at I.C.
The Rt. Hon. Harold Wilson,
M.P., Leader of the Opposition,
had a record audience for his
General Studies Lecture last
Thursday on "The Political
Scene." He was accompanied by
Richard Grossman, M.P., Shadow
Minister of Science, and intro-
duced by Professor P. M . S.
Blackett.
Mr. Wilson, after first announ-
cing that he did not intend to
make a political speech, launched
a scathing and often closely-
argued attack on the Govern-
ment's educational and economic
policies.
He expressed horror at Lord
Hailsham's complacency over the
question of scientific education,
and the loss of our graduates to
America. "Britain not only pro-
duces far too few scientists, she
wastes too many of those she has
got on abortive defence projects
or on, dreaming up fresh gim-
micks with which advertising
men persuade us to buy even
more of something we didn't even
know we wanted in the first
place."
Labour would give first priority
to the Ministry of Science. "At
present the Minister, poor fellow,
is weighed down with every gim-
mick a tired and beaten Prime
Minister can lay on him. With his
Ministry's motto, 'Research on a
Shoestring,' emblazoned on his
shield, he goes forth to do battle
with a Treasury more interested
in Surtax relief than in the Min-
istry of Science."
The U.G.C., said Mr. Wilson,
should not be under the control
of the Treasury, whose job it is
to curb spending; it should, he
concluded, somewhat surprising-
ly, be under the Ministry of
Science. One is strongly tempted
to wonder if he would have
spoken in a similar vein at, say,
the Royal College of Art.
In the case of disarmament,
firms losing defence orders should
be given R. & D. contracts to in-
vestigate all manner of funda-
mental problems. If only a few
even produced useful results, the
money would have been well
spent.
