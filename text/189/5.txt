LYNN CURTIS
Since hitting Imperial Col-
lege in the Autumn of 1962,
this explosive ICWArian has
become known to everyone in
general, and certain college
sportsmen in particular.
Her knowledge of. sport is
not, however confined to hear-
say as she formerly represent-
ed; Essex on the Hockeying
Field. Essex is her home
county, though she now has
digs in Richmond, to which
she repairs at a far earlier
hour than she customarily left
the lower lounge in the even-
ings last term.
Linda's reason for coming
to IC is to study Mathematics,
and though still in her first
year, she shows as much
promise in this direction, as in
all those more pleasurable
pastimes to which her sex is
an advantage.
The members of Maths I
have no hesitation in calling
on all men of I.C. who notice
the beauties of the Spring, to
agree with them that Lynn
Curtis is ideally suited to ful-
fill the post of I.C Carnival
Queen 1963.

INFORMATION, PLEASE
Next term, the Carnival Infor-
mation Stall will be set up in the
Union Quad. It will be a centre
for all Carnival news and infor-
mation; raffle tickets will be col-
lected and distributed, etc., etc.
R A F F L E TICKETS
Tickets for the Raffle, one of
Carnival's biggest money makers,
will be sent to you by post during
the Easter Vacation. Please try
and sell as many as you can; re-
member, for every ten you sell,
you get one for yourself, as your
"commission"; and in addition,
there is a prize for the person
who sells the most tickets. Full
details will of course be sent to
you with the tickets.
FREEDOM FROM HUNGER
Finally, some information about
the Charity which will benefit
from the Imperial College Car-
nival this year.
Freedom From Hunger was
founded to tackle the apa^ing
problems of hunger which afflict
more than half the world. It does
this in two ways; by giving imme-
diate help in cases of dire ned,
and by financing longer-range
programmes which will bring
benefit over many years.
It is one of these latter projects
which Carnival will aid; a scheme
to build a svstem of small earth
dams in Northern Nyassaland
which will irrigate many thou-
sand acres of now dry soil. The
scheme is not a spectacular one,
but it will bring to a poor com-
munity more and better food,
and, equally important, a chance
to be self-reliant. Both of these
are of course vital to the future
of a young and developing coun-
try; and therefore I hope you will
all support the Carnival, now,
during the vacation, and especial-
ly next term, with all your energy
and enthusiasm.
P.D.B.
MARION PONMAN
I very much doubt if you have
ever had the pleasure of meeting
a real live ex-councillor for the
Education of World Citizenship.
However, you may correct this
sad state of affairs by attending
the Carnival Queen Parade and
examining exhibit " A," Marion,
who was once a fully paid up
member of this distinguished
order.
In 1962 she heard that an even
nobler cause existed, and there-
fore came to I.C. to offer her
secretarial services to the Electri-
cal Engineering Department.
Marion soon found out that office
hours were unfortunately only
from 10 a.m. to 5.30 and it does
not need much of a mathemati-
cian to realise that there are 72J
hours remaining each week.
This initially presented her
with a great problem, but she
soon discovered a few methods of
whiling away these excess hours.
Ice-skating, dancing and sailing
now provide a healthy balance to
her sedentary occupation, while
Trad. lazz lends itself to effort-
less mental digestion. ?
Marion started driving two
years ago, and possessed an old
motor-car named B.O. (pro-
nounced bee-oh) for reasons best
known to mechanics. This
vehicle met with an unhappy end
suddenly last year, and was
succeeded by B.O.2, a 1935
Austin 10 which is used daily for
the journey to college.
I have no doubt that with the
help of your approval, this year's
Carnival Week functions could
have the most attractive and
gayest ever figure-head by elect-
ing Marion to the office of I.C.
Carnival Queen, 1963.
