The Dean
of
Mines
PROFESSOR J. G. BALL, B.Sc, F.IM.
Coming to the Royal School of Mines in 1956 as Professor of
Physical Metallurgy, Professor J. G. Ball was, within two years,
Head of the Metallurgy Department and was elected Dean in
October 1962.
His career, since graduation from Birmingham, has been basi-
cally one of research, firstly with the British Welding Research
Association and later with the A.E.R.E. at Harwell.
Professor Ball's attempts to brighten the sombre surroundings of
the Metallurgy Department with a selection of paintings are much
appreciated, but this was not his first essay into visual stimulation.
Research reveals that he and the staff of the B.W.R.A. decided to
brighten up the office there and
ncing impatient for the appear-
ance of skilled decorators tried to
tackle the job themselves. On
that occasion, however, the un-
timely bursting of a distemper
spray resulted in the then senior
metallurgist being so completely
white-washed that it is said that
then he was able to.join the
A.E.R.E. without any questions
being raised.
During his time in the Welding
Research Association Professor
Ball worked on the welding of
light alloys and structural steels,
and the development of new alloy
steels of good " weldability." He
was particularly concerned with
improvements in the fabrication
and welding of Baily Bridges,
sections of which he somehow
managed to construct and dis-
mantle in a tiny basement room.
At the A.E.R.E. in 1949, Ball
took over reasearch and develop-
ment on plutonium. At this there
there was no collaboration with
the Americans and the properties
of the element were an unknown
quantity apart from the fact that
they were rather(?) dangerous.
He pleasantly recalls the great
enthusiasm associated with this
work under very primitive condi-
tions and certainly far removed
from the multi-million, gleaming
monotlithic structures at Harwell
to-day. As head of a research
group. Professor Ball's first office
was in a lavatory, although he
did stress that there had been
some attempt at conversion. In
spite of great experimental diffi-
culties associated with the hand-
ling of this highly toxic
material(?) Ball's team was suc-
cessful and their endeavours were
crowned in 1953, by the setting
up of a production line for manu-
facturing the plutonium fuel ele-
ments required for the cone of
the Zephyr fast reactor. In his
last three years at Harwell, Pro-
fessor Ball took charge of the
Reactor Metallurgy Group, which
was then responsible for all
aspects of reactor technology.
Again this pioneering work was
accompanied by a great deal of
enthusiasm and excitement indi-
cated by agreeably working at
three in the morning. Asked
what his wife thought of such
behaviour, the reply was, " She
sometimes brought us coffee—
which had to be inserted through
the fence."
Professor Ball's return to acad-
emic life was prompted by the
greater breadth of approach and
intellectual freedom. His appear-
ance at Mines was heralded by
radical changes in the courses—-
a necessity in the promotion of
the science and a reduction of the
art. His opinions stem from the
belief that the cult of the amateur
has far outlived its British use-
fulness.
Under his guidance the Metal-
lurgy Department has one of the
largest postgraduate research
groups in Imperial College and he
is part instigator of a new post-
graduate course in Materials
Science which is to start in the
Autumn. Further expansion in
the form of a new chair in Ap-
plied Metallurgy is imminent.
These changes have brought
opinions of distrust from the
traditionalists but Ball rightly
points out that the R.S.M. was
founded by innovators and one
cannot live on their traditions.
To do so would mean that there
was no creation and with no
creation there is decline.
Professor Ball's administrative
and committee capacity is illus-
trated by his sitting on over forty
committees both within and out-
side the College. He classes,
from his position as an academi-
cian, the most important as being
the General Studies and the
Library Committees. Not merely
content with agreeing that an
educated student requires far
more than a knowledge of his
notes he has and is doing a con-
siderable amount of work in this
direction. Apart from the paint-
ings which have been hung in
Mines he has arranged for art ex-
hibitions in the Haldane Library.
Professor Ball's phenomenal
capacity for work is possibly am-
plified by his leisure activities
which include a voracious appe-
tite for reading, cabinet making
of a high order, music, photo-
graphy and, when he has got the
time, designing other people's
gardens. When taking his vaca-
tions, he and his wife delight in
unorganised travel and especially
enjoy touring the art galleries of
Italy. In a few weeks' time he
makes his first visit to the States
where he is going to investigate
academic developments in metal-
lurgy and materials science.
In Professor Ball there is a
man of very broad and developed
interests, a man who has the
capacity to brilliantly lead a re-
search team and who possesses
the qualities of an aware educa-
tionalist. A man Mines is glad
md proud to have as their Dean.

IC—RCM VERDI REQUIEM
"NO MORE LANDLADIES"
This is the theme of a directive
issued by the conductor of I.C.
Choir at a recent rehearsal. Why
should they be ostracised ? Be-
cause of their treatment of stu-
dents ? No ! Their looks ? No !
Their morals ? No again. But
because they have formed the
majority of the audience at all
the recent concerts of the I.C.
Choir.
The choir is a go-ahead organ-
isation efficiently directed by Dr.
Eric Brown. During the past five
years it has increased its member-
ship sixfold and this is due to the
enthusiasm of its conductor. The
repertoire is extensive and has in-
cluded such works as the Monte-
verdi Vespers, the Mass in B
minor by J. S. Bach, and the first
public performance of " N o
Room at the Inn," a carol com-
posed by Christopher Shaw, the
choir's accompanist.
The climax of the current year's
programme will be a performance
of the Requiem Mass by Verdi in
the Royal College of Music on
March 20th. This has been de-
scribed as one of Verdi's greatest
works, the music resembling
light opera rather than a sombre
dirge, as the title suggests. Could
anything be so dull with four
trumpets and two faggots as part
of the accompaniment ? Control
of a full orchestra and nearly 200
voices (over 100 of which are
female !) will be in the hands of
Dr. Brown. During rehearsals it
has become apparent that the
choir's mastery of the intricate
dynamics (f and p) of this work
will be the highlight of the public
performance.
* The concert hall of R.C.N. js
small and will seat only 700
people. Already, over 400 tickets
have been sold, we suspect to
landladies, despite the threat;
how pleasant it would be to see
I.C. students filling the OTHER
seats at this particular concert.
