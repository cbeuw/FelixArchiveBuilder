F E L I X 7
Road Relay
MANCHESTER VICTORIOUS AGAIN
Ex I.C. Man in Winning Team
Speculation ran high over the outcome of the fifteenth Annual
Hyde Park Road Relay, run on the 23rd February. Leeds, having
come close last year, were a popular choice with strong challenges
likely from several of the other Northern Universities, and a possi-
ble London victory was the burden under which U.C. started the
race. Manchester, however, confounded all the experts by winning
easily in a very fast time, giving them the Sir Roderic Hill Cup for
the third time in five years.
A record field of 78 teams came
came before the starter on a cold,
drv day on which underfoot con-
ditions were far from conducive
to fast times. C. Llewelyn-Smith
of New College, Oxford, next
year's 'Varsity captain, was the
first to move to the front of this
impressive bunch as they ran
round the first of the six three-
mile legs. He brought this minor
College team to the 1st change-
over ahead of the fie'd, including
international T. Schofield (Lough-
gorough) and several Blues.
Despite the constant attention
of the Sheffield University run-
ner, New College managed to
hold on to this lead until the
beginning of the third lap, when
they were sunk by the bigger
guns of the fancied Manchester,
Sheffield, Leicester and Durham
University teams. Ron Hill, inter-
national marathon and cross-
country runner, stormed into the
lead for Manchester with an im-
pressive run of 13 mins. 37 sees,
which brought them from 8th
place to a commanding 160 yards
lead, which they were not to lose.
Jeff Greenleaf, who never ran
in this race while at I.C., took
over from Hill and held the lead,
with Sheffield maintaining second
position. U.C., who had started
quietly now lay in 10th position,
but their deficit of 2 minutes ap-
peared too much even for their
outstanding runners, Pete Yates
and the redoubtable John Farring-
ton. By now, it was evident that
Queens' and Trinity, Cambridge
and Bart's Hospital would be in-
volved in a close fight for the
minor Colleges' trophy, the Im-
perial College Union Cup.
Manchester's lead was made
unassailable on the fifth lap by a
good run from D. Nightingale
who held a 50-second lead over
Durham with Sheffield hanging
on to third place. J. Whitton ran
a fine lap of 13 mins. 45 sees, to
bring Manchester home by a
large margin from Durham, with
Sheffield third. Mike Turner put
in an astounding 13 mins. 35 sees,
to ensure the I.C.U. Cup for
Oueens, dropping Tim Johnston,
the Inter-County Champion by
over 20 seconds.

CAVING CLUB REPORT
" Holiday in the s u n " . . .
" Glorious vistas of snowfields "
. . . " Thrills, adventure and
excitement"... the usual cap-
tions of a travel agency you
might think but no, they were all
used to describe the latest trip to
Mendip of the Saving Club-.
Seventeen assorted students
met in the I.C. lounge on Friday
evening, 1st March, expecting a
week-end of hard drinking and
hard living. After a lot of push-
ing, cursing and good luck rather
than good management, they and
their equipment were all fitted in
the van. Meanwhile to the con-
sternation of some and the
amusement of many, other mem
bers of the Club, not satisfied
with the normal amenities of the
Union had decided to climb from
the first to the third floor of the
Union on the wire ladders to test
them.
Four hours later we found our-
selves travelling between white
cliffs of snow up to twelve feet
high until at last we arrived at
the barn where we spent rather
a cold night under the stars.
After a morning lazing around
in the sun we found ourselves, at
mid-day, in old clothes outside
Swildon's Hole. Those who
hadn't been caving before won-
dered what they were in for, the
others had a superior air, all were
trying to hide their nervousness.
The cave was rather narrow at
first with a lot of crawling to be
done but it soon developed into
large chambers and long canyons
studded with formations. Soon a
dull roar could be heard ahead,
the first big drop which needed
ladders. The diverted water of
the stream hurtled over the edge
to cascade 40 ft. to the floor be-
low- One members fell off whilst
SPORTS D A Y 1963, WEDNESDAY M A Y 1st-
CLOSE CONTEST ANTICIPATED
Sports Day this year will be held at the University of London
Athletic Ground, New Maiden, Surrey, on Wednesday, May 1st.
An official College half-holiday has been granted, so that no-one
will have excuses for not being there to support his College, and
enjoy a fine afternoon's entertainment.
This year's competition prom-
ises to be even closer than last,
when the result hinged on the
final event. Guilds have already
won the cross-country team event
from R.C.S.. and at the moment
seem all set to repeat their suc-
cess in the 3 miles, to be held next
week.
In addition to the team contest,
some very close individual races
are anticipated, and very good
good performances will undoubt-
edly result. Bill Wood (R.C.S.),
who was placed 2nd in the Nor-
thern Counties 440 yds. in 48.9s.,
and won the British Universities
440 yds. title last season, may
well come close to or even im-
prove his College record of 49.1
in this event. The sprints also
promise to be good races, with
Harrison and Wood (R.C.S.), and
Jo Smith (C. & G.) who has made
great strides since last season.
The most interesting race may
well prove to be the mile, in
which two of the rival skippers,
Colins (C. & G.) and Wilkins
(R.C.S.) will meet.This year Dave
Colins has managed to avoid
serious injury throughout the
winter, and we hope that he will
now realise some of the promise
he showed when finishing 3rd in
the A l l England Schools Mile
Championship. Wilkins should
provide ample competition, since
he has a personal best mile of
4 m. 18 s. to his credit, and has
deservedly acquired a reputation
as one of the best milers and
cross-country runners in the Uni-
versity. Close finishes are also
exected in the half-mile and the
two relays, while in the steeple-
chase Wilkins (R.C.S.) can expect
a hard fight with Chris Janes
C. & G.).
In the field events. Turner
(R.C.S.) and Martin (C. & G.)
should have a keen tussle in the
javelin, while Nicholson (R.S.M.)
and Asekun (R.S.M.) are favour-
ites for the high jump and pole
vault respectively.
In addition to the athletic
events, certain other entertain-
ment of a diverting nature will be
provided. I.C.W.A. will have
some of their more talented
members competing in a "netball
match" against a team of Presi-
dents and Union Officials. A
Staff race is also being organised,
and a tug-of-war competition.
TRANSPORT & TEAS
Coaches have been arranged to
leave the Union at 1.30 p.m., re-
turning by about 6.00 p.m., and
teas will be available at the
ground. The cost of the return
journey will be 2/6d., and tickets
will be on sale early next term. '
This year's Sports Dav is going
to be an event well worth attend-
ing. Make sure that you don't
miss it by getting your ticket
early.
climbing down the ladder, but as
she was " lifelined " she only fell
about five feet before the rope
took up the strain.
Soon it was decided to return
to the surface as time was run-
ning out. The return journey was
uneventful except for the amuse-
ment caused by one member lean-
ing back on the 40ft. ladder and
catching the full force of the di-
verted stream down the back of
his neck. At four o'clock the
party wearily emerged into the
afternoon sunlight. Soon all but
one of the other parties had re-
turned. This party had arranged
to go through sump I as far as
sump II. (Sump â€” submerged
passage for diving through). At
6 o'clock they still had not re-
turned so it was decided to alert
the rescue organisation. The
number had just been dialled
when they appeared ou tof the
the rescue organisation. The num-
ber had just been dialled when
they appeared out of the cave. It
seemed that first one member had
got stuck in the sump and then
they themselves turned rescuers
and had brought out three other
exhausted cavers.
The evening was happily spent
imbibing in the local and swop-
ping experiences.
The next day again was warm
and sunny and so the morning
was again spent sun-bathing in
Burrington Coombe and drying
out wet clothes. In fact it was
so glorious that only 6 people de-
cided to cave in the afternoon,
the rest going for a walk down
Cheddar Gorge.
After an electrical fire in the
van, a puncture and snowdrifts
blocking the road the cavers were
deposited at their caves only to
find that one was flooded and the
other was like Blackpool on a
bank holiday.
The party arrived back in Lon-
don in the small hours, tired and
weary after a good week-end's
caving(?).
