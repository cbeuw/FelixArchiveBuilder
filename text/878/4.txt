Those of you who have attended the fair
in the past will notice some changes. The
biggest, at least in size, is the marquee
which has been erected on the Queen's
Lawn. The tent has been brought in to
allow all the companies who attend the
fair to be housed in one area, making it
far simpler for you to see them all.
We have tried to make the fair as
professional as possible this year, the rest
is up to you. Go out and convince the
companies that Imperial College
graduates are the best in the business and
will be an asset to any firm they apply to.
The majority of companies, this year,
will be staying for both days, enabling
you to investigate them more fully. It is
worth seeing as many companies as
possible on day one, and then selecting
those with most merit for further
discussion on day two.
Your approach to companies is all
importantâ€”too much arrogance or
timidity will do you little good. Also, a
balance needs to be found between calm
confidence and willingness to please. The
careers' advisory service will be more
than happy to help you with any
questions you have about techniques.
Basically, the Careers' Fair is a service
for both you and the companies. A fair
amount of work has been put into it,
maybe more than ever before. For it to
be a complete success, it needs your help.
Use it wisely, use it well and get yourself
a job!
OK. Serious bit over, now for the nitty
gritty. First, the reasons you should
attend:
1. I'll be very upset if you don't.
2. If you don't go you won't get a job.
3. If you do go you'll get a fab and
groovy presentation pack (actually
really nice ask spunky Ben Turner).
4. The frogs have eaten all the cheese.
The fair starts at 9.30am on Tuesday and
goes on all day, and does the same on
Wednesday. Try not to all go at
lunchtime otherwise the tent will get
smelly and you possibly won't see all the
people. This is a chance to get a job and
cock a snoot at all the other piddly little
fairs that go on at other inferior colleges.
Um, I'm not sure what to say now,
must be overwork. See what you think
and tell me about it afterwards. I'll be in
the bar, if you like it you could always
buy me a drink.
