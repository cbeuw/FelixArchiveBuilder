Pricey
Publications
Dear Chris,
If any students are about to buy books
from the Union Bookshop I think they
should consider shopping elsewhere.
Having just bought a book from the
bookstore I subsequently found it in a
high street bookshop at a much cheaper
price.
When I returned to the bookstore to
ask for a refund I was informed by the
manager that book prices are set by the
Government and cannot be reduced by
the retailer. In addition the bookstore's
policy is to refund money on faulty goods
only thus I was not entitled to a refund.
Having noted the bookstore's concern
over students needing to make their
money last (FELIX No 876). I feel sure
they can have no objection to others
being made aware of the fact they can
get better value for money elsewhere.
Yours sincerely,
G Andrade, Physics 3.

We, the Wild Angels, played in the

booked us every time last year. Thanks
BJ.

From
Mary's
With Love
Dear Chris,
Following fluctuations in the friendliness
between the Unions of St Mary's and IC
since the merger, I am very encouraged
to see that this year the good relations
set up by last year's unions continues.
This has been particularly emphasised
by the presence of Paul Shanley at
several events during Mary's Freshers'
Week. IC is quite clear that Shan feels
quite at home with us at Mary's, although
whether I'm happy at being introduced
by him as a 'Fat F**k' is less certain (but
what else would you expect from a
second-hand car salesman).
Shan is particularly popular with the
first year students at Mary's, especially
with two people neither of which have Y
Chromosomes. Indeed, Mr Shanley took
great pleasure in waking me up at
3.00am on Tuesday morning with a
young, innocent Mary's first year girl on
his arm. My chance to reciprocate, Shan,
will come soon.
I write such facts not purely for gossip's
sake (as if that is not a good enough
reason), but to show that the relations
between Mary's and IC continue to
become closer (perhaps too close, Shan?).
Long may the friendships continue.

Offence
or Defence?
Dear Sir,
Why are the finest minds that Britain
has to offer so apathetic to subjects such
as the Gulf? Doesn't it worry people that
Iraq has walked into a defenceless
country?
What I find particularly amusing is the
attitude of the left-wing parties that
Kuwait is a rich state that hoardes its
wealth. Ha! Kuwait has no taxes, free
education, free health service, in fact it is
a perfect welfare state. Iraq, on the other
hand receives about the same income (in
$ of oil per capita) and chooses to spend
its money, not for the good of the people,
but on arms, developing nuclear
weaponry, chemical weaponry, fighting
lengthy wars, and killing people,
including its own.
Surely we need to encourage countries
to spend more on civilian development? If
we do not defend Kuwait now, we are
forcing countries which would otherwise
pursue social programmes to arm up to
defend itself. It is up to us, the developed
nations, to intervene to make an example
out of Iraq.
To this end I would propose stealth
attacks, nuclear if necessary, on ALL
military targets in Iraq. Oil facilities
should be secured by conventional troops,
and the oil used to pay the UN member
states for the cost of .invading, and for
war reparations to Kuwait. If Iraq uses
chemical weapons we should have no
hesitation in retaliating with nuclear
weapons. One might argue that the Iraqi
citizens are innocent, but as long as they
choose to be led by a manipulating
religion they are as guilty as their
criminal leader. Anyone who kills for the
abstract idea of God does not deserve to
live. As for the threat of a human shield,
it must be ignored. It is simply a matter
of terrorism. We do not give in to the
IRA, the US did not give in when the
TWA jet was hijacked, we must not give
in now that a whole country has been
hijacked.
