A world class start
L E T ' S T A L K
C H R I S T M A S P R E S E N T S F R O M ICI
Id's vacation courses give you a valuable insight into the role of your chosen
discipline in the chemical industry, and give you the chance to assess what it is
like working for one of the world's largest chemical companies.
Come along to our presentation on Monday 22 October at 6pm in the
Sherfield Building Ante Room, when we will give you a taste of what the
vacation courses involve and the careers they describe.
The presentation will also help if you're interested in a career in ICI but can't
attend a vacation course. Drinks and a buffet will be provided.
