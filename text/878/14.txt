â€¢ 1 Schlumberger engineer assesses the potential of
oil wells using very sophisticated measuring
technigues. But as oil exploration and production
takes place all over the world, from the Arabian
Peninsular to the Australian outback, the way
engineers go about gaining this data requires a
unique ability to work in all environments with all the
skills at their command.
If you have a hands on approach to engineering, a
state of the art knowledge of your degree discipline,
a love of the world and a respect for its peoples, you
may have what it takes to work with us.
