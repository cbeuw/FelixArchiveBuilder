Union Posts
These two posts are up for grabs this
year. Can anyone interested, please
contact me soon.
IRC Chair (see Ben's bit)
Transport Office—Looking after the
maintenance and good running of the
Union van fleet. This includes checking
vans in for service and ensuring their
efficient running. Although it is not
essential to get involved in the actual
mechanics, the ability to fix a new
mirror, change a wheel etc, may be
useful.
Transport
Parking permits have been issued to the
following people. They can be collected
from the Union Office on Monday
October 15 between 2pm and 5pm on
production of a Union Card.
Anyone who has already unsuccessfully
applied may appeal against the decision.
Appeals should be made by completing a
new application form—available from the
Union Office. Anyone who hassles the
Union Receptionist over permit decisions
will have their application form
ceremonially brunt.
Parking Permits:
The second list of registration plates is
for those who will be given a permit on
submission of a medical certificate.
Insurance
Can all club captains/chairmen please
submit an inventory of their club's
possessions. If this isn't done, the
insurance company won't pay out on any
claims. These need to be submitted by
Friday October 26.
Cheers,
Shan.
Rape Alarms
To use the new, smaller rape alarms,
make sure you depress the red top fully.

Quick W o r d from Hon Sec
The week has been a little less hectic
than last week. Tomorrow there is a huge
party for Mencap collectors. To gain
entry to the bash you will have to do the
Monopoly.
Secondly sorry to the Chinese,
Singapore, Malaysian, Indian, Islamic,
Latin American, Nigerian, Cypriot and
Hellenic societies as they got missed out
of the Freshers' FELIX. I hope you
received your required interest.
