The diploma of the Association of the
City and Guilds London Institute, a
qualification that only City and Guilds
(C&G) graduates from Imperial College
receive, is now safe from being bestowed
upon non-IC people.
The C&G London Institute had
proposed to award the qualification to
people who didn't have to be engineering
graduates because of pressure to expand
their influence into senior awards. There
had been much opposition to this from
members of the college past and present,
who thought this would detract from the
value of the qualification.
Last years C&G union president, Chris
Home, had campaigned against the
proposal, collecting 1300 signatures from
the RCS and the C&G unions which were
presented to the C&G London Institute
during the third term last year. He also
wrote to fellows of the Institute and to
the Prime Minister.
The Institute stepped down over the
affair, and a new qualification, the 'GCGI'
or 'Graduate of the City and Guilds
Institute' will be conferred on non- IC
people.

Fire broke out in Weeks Hall last Friday
when a wall heater burst into flames at
about 1.30am. The fire was fought by two
residents on the sixth floor with a fire-
blanket and an extinguisher. A large
amount of smoke was produced which
spread into the corridor but did not
trigger any smoke alarm.
One of the fire fighters attempted to
smother the four foot flames with a wet
towel which eventually caught fire itself.
The fire was defeated, leaving the room
covered in black soot. One of the
residents told Felix that he experienced
chest pains from the acrid smoke for
several hours.
Weeks Hall bought 70 fan heaters
because of problems with the central
heating. Michael Bluck, the sub-warden
for Weeks Hall, said that the heating
system was 'old and not satisfactory' and
that residents had complained of being
too cold.
The fan heaters are placed high up on
the walls, but residents still use them to
dry wet clothing. The sub-warden said
that this could lead to a build up of fibres
so the heaters have to be cleaned
regularly. He added that this should not
be a problem in the future now that free
driers are available.
A resident of Weeks hall told Felix that
some of the heaters had 'temperamental
thermostats' and that residents often left
the heaters on accidentally. He said that
the smoke alarms had not been activated
because they were behind a closed door,
in the kitchen. The alarms have been
tested since the fire. The faulty heater
was removed on Saturday and is still
under investigation.
Michael Bluck commented that 'Now
and again one is going to conk out' and
added that he had a fan heater in his
own room.
Obituary:
Thomas Junker
The tragic death of Thomas Junker, a student from Aachen in
Germany, has deeply shocked friends. He died on the
Wednesday before last in a car crash in Chiswick. Thomas had
come to the country last February on an exchange to do his
final year project in I.C.'s Chemical Engineering department. He
was 26.
Friends said 'everybody that met him found him a warm,
friendly and charming person. He will be sorely missed'. The
funeral will be held in Germany. All enquiries should be
directed to Stefan Ledin, ext 4313, Chem Eng.
