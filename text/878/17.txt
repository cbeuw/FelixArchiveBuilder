Manager's Bit
A slighly more ordered week fo Felix
means that I shouldn't feel completly
dead today. So if y o u need something
sorted out come to me today or Monday.
That's what a few collators turning up
does for you, thank Gaia.

1 was dismayed to see o n Thursday
morning the mindless destruction of the
Barbecue in Beit Quad. Not only was this
facility a useful asset to every student in
this union (and other college members)
but it was a trial and a half to construct it
in the first place.
It was rumoured (heavily) that a
particular rugby club within IC was
involved, after losing their match on
Wednesday afternoon. Closer than this I
cannot get as it turns out all the rugby
teams lost their matches.
W h y is it that after a few beers internal
idiots come out of their shells? Perhaps it
is time to toughen the interview
techniques to sort out the jerks from
those w h o just get silly after a few jars.
A n y w a y , you're a bunch of jerks whoever
you are.
Careers' Fair
In the middle of the Careers' Fair
organisation it all seemed so up in the air
that the whole point had been wasted. A s
far as I suspected the increased
subscription fee to companies would force
many not to attend. The fact of the
matter is more companies are coming this
year than last.
Less of a profit has been raised. A drop
from £30,000 to around £5,000. This
money was used inappropriately then but
it did go towards student facilities and
new ventures.
I hope that the Careers' Fair in it's new
form is well received by its' users, us, and
that next year this year's mistakes are
learned from. Unfortunately our Fair
clashes with those in Edinburgh, Oxford
and Southampton.
Teddy Bear
The Felix teddy bear has suffered greatly
this week. A s a stress releiver it has
undergone a transformation from bear to
basketball. It's legs, arms and head
pushed into it's body, and for the first
time it bounced. A hoop was erected and
the game began.
Soon this was followed by a quick
round of volleyball until it began to
reform again into what resembled a
clubed seal. Not a pretty sight.
