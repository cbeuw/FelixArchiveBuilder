T
he book. There
is always the
book that you
have devoured
countless times, that you
always go back and get
something different out
of each time, that you can
almost memorised every
line, that you can count on
when the world lets you
down. It could be a poetry
collection, the Harry
Potter series, or a memoir.
For me, it is Fangirl.
As a clueless fresher
stepping into the intim-
idating world that is
university, I knew I had
to pack Fangirl into my
stuffed-to-the-brim suit-
case-because it is exactly
the book that taught me
what to leave behind and
what to hold on to. Con-
temporary young adult
genre, always manages
to secure a soft spot in
my heart amid audacious
adventures and heavy
historicals. It’s the sort of
book to reach for after a
stressful day, to reread on
a Sunday afternoon with a
cup of tea, and to reassure
myself that everything is
going to be okay after all.
Fangirl follows Cath as
a fangirl, a Simon Snow
fan, where she writes
fanfiction, discusses the
nitty-gritty details on
fandoms, and sticks up
Simon Snow posters
all over the walls. Now
enters Cath as a freshman
navigating college. For Fangirl // Macmillan Children’s Books=
“The narrator
often seems
detached from
her own life
as she adopts
a nonchalant
and matter-of-
fact tone”
the first time in her life,
she is off on her own
without her twin Wren
who has grown away from
fandom. Bombarded with
challenges, from family
issues to social anxiety
to academics, Cath has
to find a balance between
passion, identity, and
changes all alone in this
unfamiliar place.
The book is unique in
the way that it maintains
a rigid structure with a
chronological narrative
yet reads fluidly. I credit
this style to the concise
writing and relatable
theme that weaves all the
relationships together and
presents a charmingly-told
story at the end of the day.
