Hereisanoverviewoftheupandcomingworldofvideo

videos you are streaming games, meaning you don’t
need a crazy powerful PC; all you need is a fast internet
connection. What are the positives and negatives? will
it flourish in the current market? With further insight
into the Google Stadia and whether it can achieve the
level of success it needs to thrive.

“Unlike TV and
film, streaming
video games is
not just a one-
way street.”
I
n the last decade, we
have started to see
different forms of
media shift towards
a ‘cloud-based’ market.
A customer does not need
to own the media they
consume but instead can
stream it online (with the
caveat of a required steady
internet connection).
This has been unarguably
successful within both
the music and film/series
industry, with the recent
explosion of services
such as Spotify, Netflix,
Amazon Prime, Apple
TV+ and Disney+ just to
name a small fraction of
the current market. So, the
question is, will this work
for video games? Well…
that depends on a few
factors.
How Does It Work?
Unlike TV and film,
streaming video games is
not just a one-way street.
When a video game is
streamed to a computer,
phone or tablet, the servers
responsible for sending
the game information to
you must also receive
your controller inputs at
the same time. This means
that there is a lot more
that could go wrong and
most importantly a much
faster internet connection
is required.
The Internet Issue
In the world of game
streaming, Google Stadia
has recently come under
the spotlight with a
mixed response. During
E3 this year we learnt a
lot more about Stadia’s
tech requirements. The
bare minimum internet
speed required is 10Mbps,
which for some is already
an issue. To play 4k at
60 FPS, you are going
to need a hefty 35Mbps.
Now I don’t know about
you guys but personally,
my budget student WiFi
does not let me play at
4k so the benefit of being
able to play on my phone
or tablet (a major selling
point of Stadia) is virtual-
ly non-existent.
Even with an ethernet
connection and fast
enough internet to com-
fortably stream games,
many countries put data
caps on a household’s
monthly internet usage.
Playing games on max
settings will mean you are
spending around 16Gb
per hour. With the typical
data caps, this allots
you about 20 hours of
gameplay a month. “But
that’s plenty of time!”
I hear you cry through
the pages. That may be
plenty for some but if we
consider all the Netflix
usage and “Lo-fi hip hop
beats to chill/ study to” we
all know and love, then
it will be closer to half
that in reality. 10 hours
a month is completely
unreasonable when many
people easily game that
much in a single week…
and just the mention of ra-
tioning my Netflix usage
is already giving my free
time shivers.
The Money Problem
So not only do we have
issues with the internet,
but another growing
issue is the dividing up
of the market. Before
streaming, you could
play most games with a
Nintendo console and one
of the other big 3 (minus
with OnLive, there was
no issue with what games
you could play with a
wide variety of options
and only one subscription
payment you had to worry
about.
But now, everyone
seems to be jumping
at the chance to stream
games. Google Stadia,
Nvidia GeForce Now,
PlayStation Now and
upcoming: Project xCloud
and EA’s “Project Atlas”
are all options, and that’s
not even mentioning
the plethora of smaller
companies. Firstly, think
of my poor wallet that is
already being emptied by
the Netflixes and Spotifies
of this world. Now if I
want to experience all the
exclusive options from
these companies, I will
have to divvy out even
more cash for the dreaded
monthly subscription.
This is made worse by the
potential for even more
exclusive content with
Google Stadia already
confirmed to have many
exclusives coming to its
service.
Although there are
many negatives to this
new gaming model, let us
ponder the positives that
come out from streaming
games.
Potential Positives
Firstly, it is important
to mention that it is by no
means necessary to stream
games in order to keep up
with the hottest things in
gaming. The exclusives
which ARE coming out
are not the big-budget
titles from decades-old
franchises that everybody
loves, Orcs Must Die 3
(yeah me neither) being
the biggest one. So, if
you are not yet ready for
a streaming filled future
you do not have to be …
yet.
The biggest positive
aspect of video game
streaming is that no
longer do you have to

obvious exclusives). It
meant that there was a
