L
ast Friday, over
100,000 people
gathered in cen-
tral London to
participate in one of the
largest climate strikes
ever to occur – with
another 200,000 people
across the country also
participating.
It was one of the largest
climate strikes in world
history, with an estimated
fourmillionpeoplejoining
worldwide. The strike was
also heavily supported
by scientists, with over
2000 from across the
globe pledging support.
Strikers reported seeing
a large proportion of
young people – especially
students from university,
high school, and primary
school – attending.
The strikes follow a
new surge of climate
activism support among
young people, largely
spurred by Swedish
teenager Greta Thunberg,
who has been fiercely
campaigning for global
reform on climate policy
for over a year – giving
speeches to politicians in
multiple countries, at UN
summits, and the World
Economic Forum.
The UK strikes were
organised by the UK
Student Climate Network
(UKSCN), with over
200 events taking place
around the UK, and were
supported by various
unions around the country
– including the University
andCollegeUnion(UCU).
Liaising with the UKSCN
was Divest Imperial, a
student-led campaign
that aims to challenge the
college to cease investing
in fossil fuel-based com-
panies, alongside other
groups such as the Envi-
ronmental Society, ICU
and the GSU, and Impe-
rial Extinction Rebellion.
Divest mobilised Imperial
students, encouraging
them to meet outside the
faculty building (or ‘blue
cube’) in Dalby Court and
march to the strike togeth-
er – with the hope that
the visual display might
inspire faculty staff to
support climate activism
at Imperial in future.
In a joint action, the
Imperial UCU’s presi-
dent, Michael McGarvey,
organised a climate demo
on the Queen’s Lawn,
which was attended by
around 200 people and
featured speeches given
by megaphone on a range
of climate change-related
topics. He also spearheads
the UCU’s side of the
Fossil Fuel Divestment
Campaign, which liaises
with groups such as Divest
to pressure the college.
Imperial is known to
be heavily invested in
fossil fuel companies via
its investment portfolio,
as reported by Felix in
January 2018, as well as
having tight industry links
with companies – such
as BP, who sponsored
several academic docu-
ments handed to students
in Mechanical Engineer-
ing last year. The college
President, Alice Gast, sits
on the board of Chevron,
one of the world’s largest
oil companies, and re-
ceives a £300,000 a year
salary for it (Dec 2018);
the college portfolio has
at least £6.5 million (Oct
2018) directly invested
in fossil fuel companies
and oil field services,
and even more likely to
be indirectly invested via
managed funds; and fuel
companies also invest into
the college.
As a result, Imperial
places 130th out of 154
universities in the UK
on the People and Planet
University League tables,
which ranks universities
based on their ethical and
environmental perfor-
mance – receiving a 0%
score on both the environ-
mental policy and ethical
investment categories.
In spite of this, there is
also a scientific dedication
across many departments
to researching sustainable
energy across much of the
college – and in this regard
Imperial is a world leader,
with research groups such
as the Energy Futures Lab,
the Sustainable Energy
group in the RSM, and the
Grantham Institute.
The Divest campaign
predominantly focuses its
time on researching the
connections between Im-
perial and the fossil fuel
industry, creating work-
shops and training, organ-
ising protests on campus,
and liaising with other
likeminded groups such
as Fossil Free London and
Student Climate Action.
They pressure college and
meet with management
in order to make the case
for divestment; however,
they feel that the college
is not receptive to their
message.
“Divestment is not
simple or easy – we know
that. But as a student, I
want to see from college
any sort of commitment
– especially for an institu-
tion which is so involved
in sustainability research,”
said Ruben, a member of
Divest. “We need to do it,
to make a stand, and have
some integrity. Imperial
has a lot of influence
within the fossil fuel
business – by divesting,
they can encourage those
companies to change their
focus.”
Michael echoed this
notion. He believes that
this type of collective
action between staff and
students is essential to
instigating change.
“You can have indi-
viduals making lifestyle
decisions, but we have to
change the systems that
produce fossil fuel on a
grand scale. Given the
future repercussions of
climate change, we need
moral leadership. The tan-
gible thing we can do as
an organisation is to send
out a strong message.”
Fossil fuel companies
have been shown to have
been aware of the poten-
tial risks of fossil fuel de-
pendence since research
conducted during the
1980s, and actively Oil
companies have invested
over £200 million per
year into lobbying against
climate change awareness
since the Paris Agree-
ment. Investigations con-
ducted by UK non-profity
influencemap furthermore
reveal that fossil fuel
companies collectively
invest only 3% of their
$115 billion investment
into sustainability. Addi-
tionally, there are around
sixty universities across
the UK who have already
divested, including other
Russell Group universi-
ties such as Edinburgh.
Despite this, Naomi Pratt,
a head figure in Divest,
says that the college has
repeatedly stated that
they consider fossil fuel
companies “partners in
the fight against climate
change.”
Recently, the UCU
and Divest met with the
Provost to propose and
discuss plans to divest,
focusing on three key
points: an ethical invest-
ment policy that includes
staff and students, a 5-year
divestment plan such that
there is a slow withdraw-
al, and a dedication to
conducting the process
publicly (rather than dis-
creetly.) However, there is
little indication from the
college that there are any
plans to divest soon.
