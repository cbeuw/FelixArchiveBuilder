UNITED STATES OF
The primary elections for the
Democratic presidential nominee
have kicked off with three live
debates. A recent whistleblower
complaint claims that Donald
Trump asked foreign powers for
help in damaging the Democratic
nominee frontrunner, Joe Biden,
leading the Democratic Party to
open a formal inquiry into his
impeachment.
A very brief but broad recap of the stuï¬€ that happened in politics around the world this summer.
CANADA
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has
been embroiled in new scandals
where photos of him wearing
blackface on multiple occasians
have resurfaced, making his
reelection prospects look grim.
BRAZIL
TheAmazonforestexperienced
a 77% rise in fires compared to
summer 2018, the highest fire
count since 2012. Most fires
were started by individuals
who want to clear land to use
for farming, and they do so
knowing that the government
will not punish them if caught.
UNITED KINGDOM
Boris Johnson was elected
Prime Minister; he insists that
the UK leave the EU by Oct
31st, with or without a deal.
He has since lost his majority
in the House of Commons and
tried to shut down Parliament
unlawfully.
SOUTH AFRICA
Xenophobic rioters in Johannesburg
targeted immigrant communities
by starting fires and breaking into
shops, and quickly turned violent,
resulting in at least 12 deaths.
Countries across the continent are
responding with boycotts, threats of
economic sanctions, and recalling
diplomatic ambassadors.
FRANCE
To protest the lack of government
action on climate, activists stole
from over 100 town halls the
portrait of Macron that hands in
every administration building.
Some are being trialed for group
theft, some already convicted.
ITALY
Matteo Salvini, head of the anti-
immigrant, popuist party The
League, tried to bring down
the goverment of which he was
a member, but was foiled by
his coalition partner and the
opposition, forming a government
of national unity to keep him out
of power.
