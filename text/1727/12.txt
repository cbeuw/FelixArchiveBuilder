Imperial College is
known for many things.
Its outstanding research,
its infamous male-to-fe-
male student ratio, its col-
lection of pewter tankards
(allegedly the largest in
Europe!) But not many
people – even IC’s own
students – know about
the four vintage vehicles
living in Imperial’s own
South Kensington campus
amidst all the hustle and
bustle.
Way back in the 20th
century, the City and
Guilds Union, Royal
College of Science Union,
and Royal School of
Mines Union all decided
to acquire vehicles of
some description at
various points throughout
the century – starting with
the Guilds’ purchase of a
1908 Rover (Boanerges I)
in 1920.
Bo’ I, as he was affec-
tionately known, served as
a faithful (if loud) mascot
until 1924, at which point
he was no longer permit-
ted to participate in the
annual Veteran Car Club’s
London to Brighton run
on account of his youth-
fulness. In came Bo’ II,
a little 1902 James and
Browne town car – the
only known surviving
vehicle of the type – that
more than lives up to its
namesake of the biblical
‘Sons of Thunder’ (when
he’s not ‘Boken’, as
students affectionately if
exasperatedly say when he
decides to yet again chuck
out a bit of his engine).
Once again qualified for
the VCC’s Brighton runs,
students have since dili-
gently kept Bo’ in various
states of good repair year
after year.
Then comes 1955.
As reported by Felix at
the time, “Mines was
waking up to the fact it
hadn’t a mascot”. So, in
true inter-departmental
competitive spirit, the
RSMU acquired a 1919
Aveling and Porter steam
traction engine and named
her Clementine after the
miner’s daughter in the
song ‘Oh, My Darling
Clementine’. Unfortu-
nately, after only a scant
five years, Clementine I
followed the fate of the
song’s eponymous star
andwaslosttothestudents
when it was decided that
a steam engine with its
multitude of health and
safety requirements was
too much for the Union
to handle. The students
turned their attention to
other suitable vehicles to
take Clem I’s place, and
eventually decided that
a 1926 Morris T-type
one-ton truck that had
previously served on
a brewery estate was a
suitable replacement – her
beer holding capability
surely had no influence on
the decision whatsoever.
Clem II has since enjoyed
life as the RSM mascot,
and despite a couple of
complete overhauls over
the years by students who
had to pick up the pieces
(sometimes literally) left
behind by their predeces-
sors, she is now back on
the road trundling across
the UK to various vintage
vehicle rallies, steam
shows, and a great number
of pubs and chippys!
Not wanting to feel left
out, the RCSU’s scientists
decided they needed a
suitably flashy vehicle
of their own to transport
their president around – a
1916 Dennis N-type fire
engine was perfect, and
it just so happened that a
soap factory had one for
sale. After being offered
£50 for said fire engine,
the factory was kind
enough to donate her to
the students for educa-
tion, and so the newly
christened Jezebel came
to Imperial – no thanks
to the multiple bearing
failures that already
occurred en route to
campus for the first time.
Since then, generations
of dedicated students
have kept her 55 square
feet of brass polished to a
shine, and proudly show
her off whenever the op-
portunity arises. She has
even starred in films and
shows such as Blue Peter,
The Jokers, and Downton
Abbey (in the first episode
of season five), and has
even had an encounter
with the Queen Mother!
One would think that
three vehicles for three
constituent unions would
have been enough, but
in 1980 the Guildsmen
were gifted a 1926 Ner-
a-Car motorcycle by an
aeronautics professor, and
Bo’ suddenly had a little
brother. It was generally
agreed that whatever
name the ‘nearly a car’
motorbike was to be
called had to compliment
“Bo’”, and eventually it
came down to two options
- ‘LLOCKS’ or ‘Derrick’,
after the Hollywood
star Bo Derek. Rather
sensibly, “Derrick” had
the winning vote.
Nowadays, the vehicles
are kept in their garages
on the South Kensington
campus, and are lovingly
cared for by volunteer
students and alumni from
across all departments.
Every Wednesday, in a
corner of the campus,
you might come across
one of the vehicles and a
grease-covered monkey
– or, rather, a student – un-
derneath, tinkering away.
You might hear some
less than proper language
when the vehicles, old
and cantankerous as they
are, inevitably throw a fit
and decide to not coop-
erate. You might look up
from your studies in the
library at the sound of
Jez’s bell, Clem’s horn,
or Bo’s engine, and see
the vehicles head out for
an event or ‘test drives’,
to the sound of cheering
from random bystanders.
You might even get a ride
on the vehicles yourself at
the various College and
Union events the vehicles
pop up at annually, such
as the upcoming Welcome
Week.
Now that we’ve made
the medics wish for their
own motorised mascot, I
wish you all a wonderful
year ahead, and ask that
you keep an eye and
ear out for Jez, Clem,
Bo’, and Derrick! Don’t
worry, they don’t bite
(no promises about the
students though)! To get
involved with maintaining
these wondrous pieces of
history, please contact

Motor Club Chair, RSM
Motor Club Treasurer, and
