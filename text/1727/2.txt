New Experiences
In general, this
section will be either a
personal soapbox for
the Editor-in-Chief that
finallywon’t result in me
getting dragged away
kicking and screaming by
the Facebook Police, an-
exploration of a topic that
Felix finds particularly
relevant in a given week,
or a ‘behind-the-scenes’
look at the operation of
the Felix team. This week,
it’s a slightly mushy, over-
ly-sentimental, prose-style
version of every awful
piece of third-rate poetry
you have ever read. Bad
metaphors abound.
A new year, a new
Felix, and a new cohort
of students to join the
Imperial community.
It’san exciting time – al-
though the dreariness of
the weather has somewhat
detracted from theener-
gised vibe, as the primary
sensations of life become
the squelching of feet in
soaked-through shoes
and the irksome dripping
sound of wet umbrellas
dumped in room corners.
Being from the UK,
rain isn’t anything new.
As many international
students will learn orhave
learned, most British ste-
reotypes are a load of non-
sense – but the incessant
drizzlingof half-hearted
rain day-in and day-out is
a depressingly real fact of
life, as is our tendencyto
moan about it ceaselessly.
‘Welcome Week’,
indeed – it seems the
clouds don’t ascribe to
the concept of a warm-
welcome. Still, we should
not let that dampen our
spirits. Felix is here, and
this is my littlewelcome
to you.
For those of you who
are returning students:
you know that we’ve done
award-winningwork in
the past. We will maintain
that high standard this
year, and that standard ap-
pliesacross every section
of the paper. Whether you
just like the Puzzles and
Centrefold or areone of
those who avidly reads the
News section every week
to keep up with college
events,we will strive to
excel.
For those of you who
are just joining us: a
significant portion of this
issue of Felix is dedicated
to welcoming you and
introducing you to a few
of the core organisations
you’ll beinteracting with
over the next year. The rest
has been put together with
heart and passionby the
Felix team before the term
has even started, giving
you a taste of what is to
come from each section
throughout the year.
The team this year are
a smashing bunch. As one
‘fish out of water’ – in a
new role and tackling
new challenges as Edi-
tor-in-Chief – speaking to
all the freshers out there
who are moving from
small ponds back home
to a very large pond here
at Imperial: I can tell
you that you won’t find a
better and more dedicated
group of students than the
Felix editorial team. I’m
also proud to say that we
have a lot of new students
already joining the team,
allof whom are already
contributing to and getting
involved with the Imperial
community.
I can tell you from
experience that coming to
Imperial is an opportunity
– academically, yes,but
also in terms of holistic
wellbeing. London is,
speaking frankly, pretty
awesome, andthere are a
plethora of societies and
clubs and organisations
you can get involved with
here. These will give you
new experiences, open
your mind to new possi-
bilities, and help shape
you as a person and a
student during your time
here.
As a note to remember
in the coming week, when
you may be overwhelmed:
you’re notalone. I’m
experiencing new things
too. For example: the cen-
trefold of Felix is usually
a semi-nude photo of a
society. Tradition dictates
that the Editor-in-Chief
stars in the first issue. Yes
– this week, I experienced
for the first time a naked
photoshoot, and can now
diehappy knowing that
a picture of my bottom
will forever be part of the
British Library (where
every issue of Felix is
archived.)
The process of learning
and growing never really
stops. I used to think that
one day I’d be an ‘adult’
at long last and everything
would make a bit more
sense. I’m 23 now, have
been at Imperial on-and-
off for five years, and I
still don’t have a clue. My
18 th and 21 st birthdays
meant nothing – I didn’t
wake up the next day
having any more of a
clue than I had drinking
the night away prior to
sleeping. I’m becoming
ever-more convinced
that we have all been
deceived, and that really
we all stay young forever
in our minds.
You’ll possibly expe-
rience the same feeling
throughout this year.
Certainly at points you’ll
feel a little bit panicked
– perhaps while pumping
out the worst piece of
work you’ve ever dared
to submit at 4am and
slowly realising that you
might have to change your
expectations of your own
perfectionism, an experi-
ence I went through ap-
proximately ten thousand
times during my degree.
When that happens,
just remember: we’re all
just fishes jumping into
the same boat, flapping
around, and wondering
when the rain will start to
pour so that we can take
an easy breath.
Perhaps the weather is
a warmer welcome that
perhaps I first realised.
