An accidental
s i m u l t a n e o u s
resignation of all
full-time staff leaves
Sabbatical officers
scratchingtheirheads.

Editor-in-Chief
This week, after two
financially difficult years,
the Union have announced
that they are ahead of
budget targets. This
positive news coincided
precisely with confusion
from Sabbatical officers
who arrived in the Union
offices on Monday to find
them deserted. A solitary
post-it note had been left
at reception explaining
that all the staff had
handed in their notice a
month ago and forgotten
to mention it to the Sabbs.
The silence of the office
was punctuated only by
the incessant ringing of
the phones from students
requesting room book-
ings.
Union President
Bluejay Mood explained
that high staff turnover is
standard fare in student
unions and that whilst
the present situation was
somewhat atypical, (he
was at this point speaking
into two telephones and
typing at the same time)
there was really nothing
to be worried about. He
went on to say that the
resignations provided an
opportunity for a ‘fresh
start’attheoften-maligned
institution.
One former employee
contacted Felix to explain
their reasons for leaving
their post, stating that
they wanted to work for
a more competent and
stable organization and so
had taken a job working
for the UK Government.
Another claimed that
they never meant to start
working for the Union,
they had been looking for
the BBC Proms talks a
couple of years back and
got lost.After accidentally
stumbling into the offices
they took pity on the
struggling organization
and had been doing the
job of Managing Director
on an ad hoc basis.
Whilst some are
concerned by the pos-
sible effect on student
experience, Shane Weary
(Vice Provost – Bevs)
painted an altogether more
positive picture of recent
events: “Students may
experience slightly slower
responses to their queries
but we believe that most
members won’t observe
much difference in re-
sponse times to usual”.
He went on to explain that
the significant savings on
staff wages would now be
plowed back into new im-
provements to the student
experience, such as food
at H-Bar and breakfasts
in the SCR. Lastly, Weary
stated that whilst the
College was sad to see so
many of their colleagues
across the road leave, the
glut of leaving parties had
really turned around the
commercial outlets drink
sales for the quarter and
that they were looking
into the possibility of
making these leaving dos
a regular event.

early... to watch the
Rugby World Cup.
This week you’re an

This week you miss the
start of Freshers’ fair,
you knew you should
