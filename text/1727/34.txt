“Fiona Mozley,
the author of
Elmet, called
her book a
Western with
something
else”
W
hen I decid-
ed to write
an article for
this issue,
the first book that came to
my mind was Chemistry.
Weike Wang’s debut novel
was named one of the best
books of the year in 2018,
and received enormous
praise. So what can I say
about it that you couldn’t
find at the back of the
book? Having completed
one year of university, I
have realised that the key
to get through it is to know
that you are not alone,
that there is someone else
going through the same
things as you, and this
book gives you that much
needed comfort.
Chemistry introduces
us to the narrator, a bright
but confused Asian-Amer-
ican PhD student with
intelligent, strict parents,
a smart, patient boyfriend,
a successful best friend,
and an adorable dog. This
seems like a life with little
to complain about, and
the narrator’s insecurity,
anxiety, and indecisive-
ness is puzzling until she
begins to unfold its layers,
and we start to see a strug-
gling Asian-American
PhD student with parents
that expect too much, a
boyfriend too good for
her, and a best friend she
would never be as success-
ful as – a life not so perfect
after all. Chemistry in
Chinese means “the study
of change”, and the novel
gracefully explores how
the relationships around
her evolve the way they
do, as the narrator re-eval-
uates her relationship with
herself, and her passion
for science.
Although narrated in
first person, the narrator
often seems detached from
ing one, and you will only
be surprised by all the
things it makes you feel as
it progresses.
We enter university with
the determination to excel,
but it is not long before we
start questioning whether
we will even graduate,
not long before we relate
strongly to the narrator’s
voice: “Think small, I
tell myself, think doable,
think of something that
might impress no one but
will still let you graduate
and find a job.” We often
feel burdened by all the
pressure, and sometimes
can’t help but give up.
Chemistry assures us that
sometimes it is okay to do
so, while at the same time
makes us realise its effects
on others, especially our
parents. In this beautiful
novel of self-discovery,
we also find the narrator
understanding different
points of view, and why
chose to write about it in
this section. Chemistry
promises us that though
it may not be in the ways
we expect, everything will
eventually fall into place.

“The narrator
often seems
detached from
her own life
as she adopts
a nonchalant
and matter-of-
fact tone”
her own life as she adopts
a nonchalant and matter-
of-fact tone. The flow
of the narrative is often
interrupted by stating
related scientific facts that
either compare, contrast,
or somehow convey her
feelings about an event in
her life. Take for example
the very beginning of the
novel – “The boy asks
the girl a question. It is a
question of marriage. Ask
me again tomorrow, she
says, and he says, that’s
not how it works.” – which
is immediately followed
by “Diamond is no longer
the hardest mineral known
to man.”, to express her
doubts about the proposal.
This rather unique and
detached narration mostly
comes across as humour,
yet we are able to under-
stand that the narrator is
trying hard to find herself
and make sense of her
feelings about her PhD, the
proposal, and her parents.
Thus, despite the humour,
this novel manages to be
an emotionally devastat-
everyone around her is
the way they are, and
we observe a character
development we not only
relate to, but also can
learn from.
This is one of the
books I’ve read that
didn’t leave me even after
I’d finished it, and so I
“Chemistry
promises us
that, although
it may not
be in ways
we expect,
everything will
eventually fall
into place”
