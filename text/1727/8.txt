CGCU
Thomas Cross
CGCU President
T
he City &
Guilds College
Union (CGCU)
is the student
body of the 4200 un-
dergraduates and 1600
postgraduates across the
Faculty of Engineering.
Since 1889, we have stood
up as the student voice
for Imperial engineers:
enhancing your student
experience, boosting wel-
fare, and advocating on
your behalf on academic
matters.
If you are an under-
graduate or postgraduate
Student at Imperial
College London studying
Aeronautics, Computing,
JMC, or any of Bio,
Chemical, Civil, Design,
Electrical and Electronic,
Electronic and Informa-
tion, or Mechanical Engi-
neering, then you are both
a member of the Imperial
College Union and the
CGCU.
Our main purpose is
advocating for you, our
students. If you don’t
like something with your
course and want your
voice heard, come to us.
We’ll stand up for you and
see that your needs are
heard and your opinions
are valued. For many of
you, university will be
unlike anything you will
have experienced; here
you have an ownership
of your education and
together we can change
things.
This is what Unions
are for. To be the student
voice. We also organise
some amazing events,
well-being campaigns,
and we manage the eight
engineering departmental
societies and nine C&G
clubs – such as Racing
Green, Space Society and
IC Robotics. For more
information on these go to
cgcu.net/clubs.
This year we’ve got
three main foci - Com-
munity, Inclusivity &
Support. We want to re-
develop the sense of com-
munity within the Faculty
of Engineering that used
to provide great out-of-
degree relief to Imperial
students. We want to
make the CGCU a student
body that is personal
to you, whatever your
background is; a body
that enriches your student
experience. If times get
tough we’re here for
you, and work with both
faculty and our alumni
association (CGCA) to
support students whose
work and wellbeing is
affected by unfortunate
circumstances – whether
that be financial hard-
ships, mental or physical
illness, or other situations
like bereavement.
A unique feature are
our mascots - mighty
symbols of our trade.
Each CU has them, and
the other universities in
London used to (until
they decided not to be
fun.) For engineers these
are the mighty Bronze
Spanner III (29kg) which
fits the fasteners on Tower
Bridge, and the Immense
Bolt (31kg). The “Great
Game” between students
is stealing other Unions’
mascots and holding them
to ransom. This is just
part of the utter madness
that the CUs engage in
on the social side - along
with other non-academic
pursuits, such as our pub-
lications Guildsheet and
The Spanner or the “Pie
Squad”.
Our office is CAGB
350 (located in the City
& Guilds Building where
Aeronautical, Civil, and
Mechanical Engineers
have lectures) - so why
not pop by for a chat or a
cup of tea? We’re always
open when the light is
on, with our mascots and
striped blazers. Also, look
out for C&G Week in
February, just one of the
many events (“ents”) we
run. It will be a week of
welfare activities, club
nights, sports, and other
activities showcasing
the inter-departmental
community that is the
CGCU. In first term,
we also have our annual
welcome dinner, first dog
petting session, the launch
of our legendary football
league, and a mince pie
and mulled wine night.
Keep up with the
CGCU via Facebook
(IC CGCU), Twitter (@
IC_CGCU), or on their
site, cgcu.net.

I
ntroducing:thegrand,
the magical, the
won’t-believe-your-
eyes spectacular:
Imperial College School
of Medicine Students’
Union (ICSMSU) and our
new column in Felix!
To our dear freshers:
welcome to Imperial. Let
me offer congratulations
for what I imagine is the
bazillionth time on getting
in and making it to halls
on your first day (that’s
step one complete)!
To our returning
students: no, I can’t
believe that the summer
is over either, but I’m sure
the 5th and final years
simply feel they never
really began.
Starting university can
be a tough time for even
the biggest fish in smallish
ponds, so it’s important to
know that you’re not alone
and are in fact now part of
many great new families
and communities.
The greatest of these
families (and indeed, as
with all great families,
one with a turbulent but
inspiring past) is that of
the ICSM. ICSM was
officially founded in
1997 by the merger of the
ancient Medical Schools
at St Mary’s, Charing
Cross, Westminster and
the Royal Postgraduate –
but our story is a lot older
than that.
It was in the very labs
that still stand at St Mary’s
where Sir Alexander
Fleming discovered pen-
icillin in 1928, where Sir
Roger Bannister gained
his MBBS before running
the 4-minute mile in 1954,
and where Adam Kay first
started writing This Is
Going to Hurt – and those
are just a few of the more
famous examples.
Our students have been
the core of our community
for over 150 years, and in
that time we have changed
–andlearnt–alottogether.
Now, our Student Union
stands proud to still offer
the services we did back
in 1854, and we hope
that you will be able to
celebrate and enjoy these
during your time here.
If you need academic
advice, want to change
how the course is run,
would like to speak about
welfare, wellbeing or
mental health, want to
join one of our 60+ clubs
and societies, or simply
get involved in a year
packed with fantastic in-
clusive events, ICSMSU
is ready for you – come
by our office, located in
the ground floor of SAF,
any time.
The real question is: are
you ready for us, and for
the amazing years ahead?
The ICSMSU can be
contacted via email at
