While you were away...
It was, as it very often is, an eventful summer for music. In this, the first edition of the new academic year, our
music editors take you through it all - from Lizzo, Men I Trust and BROCKHAMPTON to King Gizz and JPEGMAFIA.

Despite being the first
album in four years for
the nuck trio, there had
been a steady sprinkling
of singles coming out
throughout that time to
feed the hungry ears of
fans. That means that 8 of
the 24 tracks on the long
awaited Oncle Jazz were
already known to fans of
band Men I Trust.
Being a band of this
size, (they sold out their
show at Village Under-
ground last year quickly
enough for me not to get
tickets) while also telling
record labels to get fucked,
is quite an achievement.
That is why their plan of
slowly releasing singles
over a period of intense
touring (upside is they’re
in London every year), in
order to grow their follow-
ing, worked so brilliantly.
It also allowed their
sound to mature, as they
retreated to the Quebec
countryside, mixing, re-
cording, fine-tuning until
their sound peaked in an
album that flows from
start to finish so smoothly
it’s hard to not slide all
the way down, even if
you just dipped your toe
in for a tune. So smooth.
“We’ll be alright // Stay
here some time // This
country dog // Won’t die
in the city”, a chorus that’s
been spinning around my
head ever since ‘Tailwhip’
came out as a single, sums
it up nicely: the album is a
breath of fresh air.
Their lyrics are so
quietly poignant, a virtue
which is rare in the era of
screamtertainment, and
make the perfect filling for
the blanket of melancholy
which constitutes many of
their melodies. But even
the lyricless nuggets in
the album - ‘Slap Pie’,
‘Fiero GT’, and especially
‘Poodle of Mud’ - do a
lot to round out the sound
of the album. Oh, and
‘Numb’sounds like a Mild
High Club song - always a
plus. Where’s YOUR new
album BOIS!? - MF
“...quietly
poignant, a
virtue which
is rare in the
era of scream-
tertainment...”
Released in April this
year, Cuz I Love You’s
riveting energy took its
time to creep into public
consciousness, but with
a little help from meme
culture (“I just took a
DNA test, turns out I’m
100% that bitch”) Lizzo’s
major label debut charted
highly this summer.
Blending RnB and
Hip-hop influences
with an impeccable
pop sensibility, Lizzo
proves herself a high par
songwriter throughout;
from the bombast of the
title track, to bangers
like ‘Heaven help me’
and ‘Like a girl’. Instru-
mentals blend trap-style
drums and synths with
live instruments, creating
a listenable backdrop
for the Minnesotan’s en-
thralling deliveries.
Lizzo’s voice croons,
groans, belts and teases
to measure on each track,
allowing her to inject her
uplifting and often witty
(if simple) lyrics with a
life of their own. Without
this life, the themes of
self-love, equality and
heartbreak that are Cuz I
Love You could feel flimsy
and inauthentic, but here
they are entirely heartfelt.
Despite some weaker
tracks towards its rear end
(‘Exactly how I feel’ and
‘Better in Colour’come to
mind), Cuz I Love You is a
delight on the ears; a must
listen for 2019. - MG
They’re back, and
ready to bear all in their
most depressed release
yet.
GINGER is for many a
desiredlookintotheminds
of the world’s biggest
boyband following a
series of major distur-
bances to the group. After
the not very “sonically
consistent” iridescence
it seems that the group
has regained some of its
creative cohesion. The
band work through and
discuss much of what has
been troubling them over
the past year, the most
anticipated of which was
the decision to remove
Ameer Vann (covered
on the track ‘DEARLY
DEPARTED’).
It seems as though the
band is finally finding
solid footing after losing
such an integral member.
In places the chemistry
is not quite what it was
in the Saturation days,
but it appears we may
be headed towards
something different and
exciting. The production
is still fresh, keeping even
the most avid of listeners
on their toes speculating
what may come next.
Combined with a matu-
ration of the distinctive
vocal/rap styles within
the group, this album has
helped remind us that
BROCKHAMPTON are
stronger than ever and
ready to keep making
fantastic music. - GR
Tool’s fifth album, Fear
Inoculum, has blessed our
ears after 13 long years
of waiting. In true Tool
fashion, the 10-track, 87-
minute long prog-metal
extravaganza begs to
engulf you, smothering
you with 10-minute
progressive masterpieces
that help you to ascend to
the astral plane. However,
for an album that’s been
stewing for over a decade,
it’s not everything you
may expect.
Frontman Maynard
James Keenan vocals
spend a large proportion
of the album on the back-
burner, with the interplay
between the instruments
taking centre stage; this
is much like how Tool
prefer to perform on stage
nowadays, with Keenan
hiding in the shadows
to let the music take
precedent. This results
in a truly mature sound,
which is overtly intricate,
demanding the need for
repeat listens to capture
all the details.
This isn’t unlike Tool
though, and there are defi-
nitely notable tracks from
the band on this album:
‘Descending’, ‘7empest’
and the album’s epony-
mous track are all sure to
stand the test of time as
some of Tool’s best.
In short, Tool have
gifted their fans with a
new album, and if you’re
a Tool fan, it does not
disappoint. Although if
you’re new to the Tool-
game, personally I’d start
somewhere else. - EF
