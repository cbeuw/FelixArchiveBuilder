Werther at the Royal Opera House
T
he opening night
of Werther was a
beautiful master-
piece, however
it was underwhelming
at times. Massenet’s
Werther, based on
Goethe’s Die Leiden des
Jungen (The Sorrows
of Young Werther), is a
classic story of two star-
crossed lovers – whose
love brings sorrow to both
themselves and the people
around them.
The Royal Opera House
was filled with a vibrant
and excited atmosphere
as people came to see the
famous Peruvian tenor
Juan Diego Flórez cast as
Werther opposite Isabel
Leonard as Charlotte.
Despite the buzzing at-
mosphere of the theatre,
the ambience of the entire
theatre changed as soon as
the curtains were opened.
The excited anticipation
instantly changed to
intrigue as the stage was
revealed. The first act
commences with the Bailli
teaching his children
the cheerful “Noël!
Jésus vient de naître” as
they frolic around the
grand but realistic set.
Before the audience meet
Werther for the first time,
we are greeted with his
ominously large shadow
approaching on the door
of the Bailli’s house.
When Charlotte and
Werther finally meet, the
audience expect this elec-
trifying, almost tangible
connection between the
two lovers – however
I found this aspect to
be missing throughout
most of the performance.
We learn of the death
of Charlotte’s mother
and Charlotte’s promise
to marry Albert despite
her feelings for Werther.
Whilst this production is
meant to be a tale of their
forbidden love, it seems
more like an obsession
on the part of Werther
towards Charlotte, with
him even appearing to
throw a tantrum at the end
of Act II when Charlotte
marries Albert.
Nevertheless, as
the production drew
to a close, the feelings
between the two lovers
became more apparent.
The turning point in the
opera was where Char-
lotte finally admits her
love for Werther after
reading his letters. When
she runs after him, the
drawing room doors burst
open into a beautiful night
sky – filled with beautiful
amber hues that looked
like burning embers
falling through the sky.
The realistic yet extrav-
agant set was replaced
with a vast, endless sky
that highlighted and
emphasised every action
and lyric performed by
the two lovers. When
Charlotte finds Werther
again in the final act, the
audience sees Werther
alone in his blood-stained
shirt in his apartment with
the burning embers still
visible in the night sky.
His apartment, initially off
into the distance slowly
approached the front of
the stage – drawing the
audience in to find out
more.
Throughout the per-
formance, there was no
doubt about the talent
of each of the perform-
ers – the singers, as
well as the orchestra, all
delivered an outstanding
show. Although if I am
being perfectly honest,
the orchestra completely
Don Giovanni
K
asper Holten’s
tech-heavy Don
Giovanni has
been trotted out
on the ROH stage for the
third time. The eye-catch-
ing set is unquestionably
the most remarkable thing
about this production.
Unfortunately, it detracts
from, rather than adds to,
the performance, leaving
one wondering where
Holten’s priorities lie.
Inspired by Escher’s
labyrinthine illusions,
Es Devlin’s set places
the story of licentious
seducer Don Giovanni
in a series of rooms that
morph and shift endlessly.
The revolving rooms and
staircases convey a sense
of clandestine meetings,
endless corridors and
sexual subterfuge - in
short, the atmosphere of
DonGiovanni.LukeHalls’
video designs breathe life
to the architecture with an
ever-changing backdrop,
choreographed precisely
onto the moving set. Red
splotches of blood for the
Commendatore’s death;
blue summer skies for
Don Giovanni’s false
tales of seduction; black,
treacly teardrops when
Don Ottavio sings of the
tears of Donna Anna.
It’s quite a stunning light
show but also rather like
watching a giant mood
ring display the overall
atmosphere of the opera at
any one time, which gets a
bit annoying.
Holten, known for
his controversial inter-
pretations of operas, has
cleverly de-victimised
Don Giovanni’s con-
quests. Rather than being
a helpless maiden, this
Donna Anna is a willing
and manipulative ac-
complice, cavorting with
Don Giovanni even as
she commands fiancee
Don Ottavio to avenge
her honour. Zerlina, the
newlywed bride who is
the next to catch Don
Giovanni’s eye, is also no
simple-minded country
girl. Her accusation of
rape at the end of Act 1
is transformed into a ploy
on her part, with Zerlina
ripping her bodice and
crying for help before Don
Giovanni ever touches
her.
A pity then that the
performances were so
wooden. There was hardly
any chemistry or dramatic
tension on stage - charac-
ters appeared, sang their
lines and disappeared
off into the wings again.
Malin Byström as Donna
Anna bitterly lamented
her father’s death - from
about three feet away and
facing the opposite direc-
tion. There was a severe
lack of eye-contact, the
singers choosing to sing
at the audience rather than
to each other. Where was
the heat and passion of the
rakish Don Giovanni, or
the tormented vengeful-
ness of the jilted Donna
Elvira? Despite the
remarkable voices of the
singers, everything felt
very forced. Combined
with the set, it felt like we
were watching puppets
pop out of a painted music
box to deliver their lines
at the prescribed times.
This is terribly unfair
on the cast, who are in
themselves really rather
good. Erwin Schrott, in the
titular role of unrepentant
sinner Don Giovanni,
is a commanding, hon-
ey-voiced bass-baritone
whose potential seems to
be unlocked only in the
finale. As he rails against
the spirit of the Com-
mendatore, steadfastly
unrepentant till the end,
the defiance and courage
of our antihero Don
Giovanni finally comes
through. Indeed, most
of the cast only shone as
characters in the second
act when the set was less
fussy and they had the
stage to themselves. One
exception was the comic
couple, Zerlina (Louise
Alder) and Masetto
(Leon Košavić), whose
natural interactions and
strong singing made them
welcome relief from the
somewhat unconvincing
melodrama panning out
throughout the first act.
Perhaps one can put it
down to opening night and
the cast not having settled
into their roles or the dis-
orientingly kaleidoscopic
set. But for whatever
reason, this Don Giovanni
just didn’t do it for me. It
is a pretty music-box of a
production, but the drama
and emotion seem to have
been sacrificed for fancy
light tricks.
