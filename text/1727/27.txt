n the midst of the
political turmoil
and uncertainty
produced by Brexit,
one thing is certain:
a General Election is
about to take place, and
regardless of which side
of the argument you are
on, your vote matters.
More than ever.
You will need to
register to vote using your
new student accommoda-
tion address at
gov.uk/register-to-vote
(unless you are living at
home and have already
been registered to vote
at your home address).
You will need to provide
your National Insurance
number (which should
be on your payslip if you
have worked before; you
may have used it on your
Student Finance applica-
tion as well).
The result of this
upcoming election will
determine if you need a
visa to spend a year of
your course in the EU; it
will determine if you can
access healthcare on the
same basis as local EU
citizens; it will determine
if you will have to pay
roaming charges for using
your phone in the EU; if
your tuition fees change,
or if they’ll be abolished;
if recreational cannabis
becomes legal; if you
need to upload your ID
or purchase a permit from
a newsagent to consume
online pornography; if
you need a visa to remain
in the UK, the election
outcome will also deter-
mine if and how you will
be able to stay after your
course ends... the list
goes on. No matter who
you are and which side of
the argument you are on,
this election will make a
difference to you and your
future.
All British, Irish and
Commonwealth citizens
can vote in a Parliamen-
tary General Election,
regardless of the type
of visa you hold, even
those with Tier 4 student
visas and BN(O) passport
holders from Hong Kong.
Things are different for
EU citizens – while you
can register to vote, you
can only vote in local,
regional and European
elections. And unless you
are also an Irish or Com-
monwealth citizen, you
cannot vote in General
Elections (Cyprus and
Malta are the only two EU
countries which are also in
the Commonwealth). As
for referendums, there are
no fixed laws regarding
EU citizens’ voting rights,
and if the Parliament
decides to hold a future
referendum that franchis-
es EU citizens, you will
need to be registered in
order to have a say in it.
You may think that
voting is futile, maybe
because you don’t
think the candidate you
support has any chance of
winning, or maybe you’re
certain that the candidate
you like will win without
your vote. But, these are
not valid reasons to give
up your vote. It’s obvious
that if everyone thinks
voting is useless because
the outcome was already
predictable, the actual
outcome may instead be
drastically different.
Another frequently
neglected reason to vote
is that the margin of a
candidate’s win influences
their behaviour and voting
intentions in the Parlia-
ment. If the candidate
you like or you hate wins
by a big margin, they can
voice more strongly the
opinions that you

manage to scrape a win,
they may have second

Most importantly, even
if the outcome of the
election is not what you
have hoped for, you will
not regret exercising your
right to demonstrate what
you believe is good for
this country.
While an early General
Election hasn’t been
officially announced, both
the Government and the
opposition parties have
expressed the intention
to call one either before
31st October, or after
a Brexit extension has
been secured. Parties
are already pouring out
election promises, and
those that haven’t are cer-
tainly ready to do so once
their party conferences
start. There is no doubt
a General Election will
take place in the coming
months.
