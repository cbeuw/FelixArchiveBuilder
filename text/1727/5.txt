experience where we want
it to be. Once we’ve done
that, then we can think
about other things that
we can do … I wouldn’t
even want to contemplate
increasing student until
we’ve got our act together
as far as the student expe-
rience is concerned.”
Blackett and physics
are not the only ones at
Imperial to have struggled
with space and facilities.
There have been multiple
approaches to the problem
across different depart-
ments in recent years. The
college decided to sell St.
Mary’s, to the outcry of
many medical students,
and build improved
spaces at other campuses
such as Charing Cross
to compensate. Several
departments decided to
move a portion of their
facilities and faculty to
the White City campus –
and Michele revealed that
when she took up office,
she was also asked to
consider a similar move
for physics.
“When I first became
Head of Department, I
was asked to look into
how many staff might in
the future move over to
White City – and which
specific parts of the de-
partment might have that
desire. And then I became
aware that there wasn’t a
college fund to finance the
move. The conversation
evolved into discussing
our needs and wants in
terms of space overall
and what’s good for the
department long-term.”
Asked about the pres-
ence physics might one
day have in White City,
she said “organically, it
would be good to have a
footprint over there – a
lot of our staff work with
the chemists anyway. The
thing that worries me is
undergraduate students
remaining in South Kens-
ington while staff move,
which may have an effect
on the connection between
staff and students. This is
something that I know
Chemistry is working
very hard at. White City
is a fantastic space; we
should be thinking about
how we utilise it, but it
will cost a lot of money to
move there. There needs
to be a plan around how
that would be carried out.”
The approach in
physics is, therefore, to
invest heavily into fully
optimising the space
available before giving
up on the historic Blackett
building – at least for now.
In her words: “until we
turn things around in the
short-term, nothing is ever
going to happen in the
long-term … making the
space we have better for
students – that’s a starting
point.”
This is an approach
which will likely be
popular with students
– giving them a clear
benefit with little poten-
tial drawback – but the
concern is what the long-
term solutions might end
up being should the trend
of expansion across the
college continue. There
is a cap on how effective
optimisation can be; in
the end, physical limi-
tations in the space will
mean that nothing more
can practically be done.
One option that’s being
explored is building a new
student-focused space via
donations – the issue there
then being that real estate
near Blackett is very
expensive, or completely
unavailable.
One core difference
with the physics depart-
ment’s approach is the
abundance of student
consultation during these
projects – a sign that a
genuine commitment to
involving and integrating
students into the depart-
ment is present. The col-
lege’s decision to sell St.
Mary’s, by contrast, was
made with very little – or,
depending on who you
ask, none at all.
As these refurbishment
projects have been under-
taken over the last several
years, physics’ National
Student Survey scores
have been plummeting.
Despite a small rise in
many satisfaction catego-
ries in the 2019 survey,
every category from sat-
isfaction with teaching to
feedback to management
have fallen over 10%, and
in some cases much more,
since 2015. The hope
remains that changes such
as refurbishments and
curriculum reviews will
continue to improve the
student experience – but

the long term.
priority is not the score
itself, but to holistically
and genuinely improve
student wellbeing.
“When I saw the NSS
comments last summer, I
was devastated … they’re
really saddening. And
we’re beginning to turn
things around a little. But
I had warned everyone in
the department – I said
we’re not doing this to
turn around NSS scores.
It doesn’t take a year, it
takes four, five, ten years
to turn them around – if
that's what we’re aiming
at. For me, I just did not
want students leaving
here thinking ‘I haven’t
enjoyed my time here’.
It’s not an easy degree – I
don't want to change that
– but I want it to be an
interactive degree. I want
students to feel part of the
department – we are not
a department without the
students.”
“When I
first became
Head of
Department,
I was asked to
look into how
many staff
might move
over to White
City.”
