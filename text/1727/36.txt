Introduction
O
ver the years of
our lives on this
planet, we have
found multiple
ways to document our
past. One of these ways,
photography, has emerged
as the most widespread
and effective way to
record our daily lifestyles.
With the ability to capture
the state of our world at the
simple click of a button,
cameras have proved to be
one of the most important
tools in human history.
The saying, “A picture is
worth a thousand words,“
truly marks how cameras
have become our go-to
tool for creating visual
journals; they save the
time and effort to maintain
written ones.
Today, smartphones
prove to be the most
accessible way to use a
camera. With the rise of
social media and compe-
tition between vendors,
smartphone camera
modules have received a
complete overhaul from
what they were a decade
ago.
Evolution of Cameras
In the early 2000s,
h i g h - p e r f o r m a n c e
cameras were rarely made
for the regular consumer.
Besides, these tools were
highly-priced and rather
bulky. Pocket cameras,
often called point-and-
shoots, were the most
popular among buyers,
especially tourists and
hobbyists. With the rise
in popularity of mobile
handsets, it only made
sense for vendors to bring
in the camera as an added
selling point, thus making
cameras ubiquitous.
This move took off and
presented a high demand
for cameras to eventually
become a standard feature
ofthemodernsmartphone.
Conveniently, it made for
one less device to carry
around while traveling,
thus significantly reducing
the overall footprint of the
camera. However, this
shift saw manufacturers
face challenges related to
the performance, quality,
and feature set of mobile
camera modules.
Social Media and
Competition
With the rise of im-
age-based social media,
especially Instagram
and Snapchat, the urge
to share our lives with
others through pictures
has been more than
ever; in other words, it’s
more like maintaining a
common visual journal
where one could share
their lives with others.
This rise has marked
demand for smartphones
with more-capable,
high-performing camera
systems, thus placing
pressure on smartphone
producers to innovate and
push out devices that meet
the needs of the buyer.
Needless to say, this is, in
fact, a profit-making op-
portunity for these com-
panies. However, it’s the
competition between them
to secure a higher share of
profit that drives the in-
novation behind building
camera modules that offer
a wide array of pro-level
features to the end-user.
This healthy competition
primarily results in con-
sumers gaining access to
high quality, feature-filled
products at an affordable
price. One of the recent

ple-camera setup.
The Multiple Camera
Smartphone
In 2016, our world saw
the shift towards multiple
camera smartphones,
starting successfully
with the iPhone 7 Plus.
Traditional cameras, such
as DSLRs, mirrorless,
and point-and-shoots, are
composed of single-lens
systems. In the case of
DSLRs and mirrorless
cameras, these systems
often have the capability
of swapping lenses to offer
flexibility in the degree
of zoom while main-
taining image quality;
they’re often referred to
shoots). Thus, the image
produced would have
reduced image quality.
On the other hand, in the
case of optical zoom,
the camera utilizes lens
optics to shift the focus to
a nearer or further point
while maintaining image
quality.
Devices housing these
systems are often bulky,
especially when the lens
system is extended to
match the zoom level.
Smartphones, on the other
hand, are considerably
thinner and can’t afford
the space to accommodate
fully-fledged single-lens
systems as found in
point-and-shoots, let
alone the interchangeable
lens systems of DSLRs
and mirrorless cameras.
Instead, they house small,
compact cameras that rely
heavily on digital zoom.
Smartphone producers
faced the challenge to in-
troduce optical zoom into
their cameras while main-
taining the same thin form

Smartphones vs Pro
Cameras
With all this talk about
how smartphone cameras
are getting better, you
must be wondering how
they match up with pro-
fessional cameras. Well,
to be fair, smartphones
are far behind high-end
DSLRs and mirrorless
cameras primarily due to
the lack of larger image
sensors. Image sensors act
as the retina of cameras;
it’s the part that captures
light and records the infor-
mation through pixels. In
most cases, the larger the
sensor size, the better the
image quality. In addition,
the low light performance
of smartphone cameras
is comparatively poorer
to those of pro-cameras.

multiple camera systems
were born. Here, a second
camera, containing a
telephoto lens, facilitates
the system to operate at
different focal lengths,
thus being able to capture
high-quality zoomed-in
images. Furthermore,
the multiple lens system
made way for portrait
photos to be possible on
smartphones, albeit with a
lot of software assistance

noise reduction to depth
mapping, smartphones
utilize their tight inte-

this feature. On the other
hand, point-and-shoots
have a single lens system
that’s capable of capturing
images across multiple
zoom levels, albeit with
diminished image quality;
here, the lens system is
integrated into the body of
the camera. Most low-cost
point-and-shoots make
use of digital zoom rather
than optical zoom, which
is heavily used in the
higher end cameras.
