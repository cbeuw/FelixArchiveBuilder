Big noise. Little action.

S e p t e m b e r ,
millions of
people from
across the globe went on
strike and demanded that
the world’s governments
take action to combat the
issue of climate change.
With placards held aloft,
rousing speeches given
and chaos caused, the
protesters were successful
in raising awareness of the
issues at hand, but all we
got from politicians was a
‘promise’that they will do
more.
So far, only 18 of
the 28 EU nations have
pledged to be carbon
neutral by 2050, and
really, who knows if
this will be achieved,
or whether this deadline
will merely get pushed
further and further
back. In the US, the
government has essen-
tially ignored protesters
and continued with its
policies of reopening
coal mines and extract-
ing more oil. When so
many people make their
views so clear, politi-
cians that ignore them
should do so at their
own peril, but it really
seems that they aren’t
that bothered by the risk.
Despite the protesters’
simple message – let’s
cut our emissions and
save the planet – the
solution is not so simple.
Governments across
the globe are asking:
what do we actually
need to do? Is it right
in a liberal society to
demand people use less
energy? Is it practical
to abolish single use
After strong words at the UN Climate Change Summit and large protests across the globe, when will politicians
get serious about tackling climate change?

plastic? Where can we
build windfarms so that
people won’t kick up
a fuss? The sheer com-
plexity of all the con-
siderations to be made
is astonishing. Further-
more, the President of
the US refuses to believe
in climate change, and
other big economies
such as China and India
are reluctant to pursue
eco-friendly policies at
the expense of economic
growth. Therefore, it
is not surprising that
smaller nations, such as
Britain, which contrib-
utes only 1.2% of global
emissions, don’t see
any point in meaningful
action when rhetoric
has seemed to be just
as effective at pleasing
people until now.
However, rhetoric
is no longer working,
and people want action.
Previous attempts at a
global response, through
the Paris Accord, have
been unsuccessful and
this is leading to frustra-
tion with voters. At the
UN general assembly,
Greta Thunberg, the
Swedish activist, said to
politicians “you are not
doing enough” and that
if they “really understood
the situation and contin-
ued failing to act then
you would be evil.” Yet
a sudden shift to a carbon
neutral economy by 2025,
as demanded by Extinc-
tion Rebellion, would
have a massive impact on
everyone’s way of living.
For example, taxes on
emissions could lead to
higher energy prices and
restrictions on pollution
would mean we must
take less foreign holidays.
Not everyone is prepared
for that. There could be
job losses too. If the oil
and gas industry, which
supports 375000 jobs in
the UK, was to collapse,
there would be a huge rise
in unemployment, and
this would lead to great
dissatisfaction with politi-
cians who support climate
change action. It would
be tragic for positive
climate action to become
a source of controversy
and contempt, and equally
tragic for future genera-
tions to suffer from rising
temperatures and sea
levels because we failed
to act.
It could be argued that
in the UK some mean-
ingful action has already
been taken. Investment in
renewable energy means
that now a minority of
our energy comes from
burning coal, oil, and gas.
The government also has
a 25 year sustainability
plan to reduce emissions.
The government argues
that these small steps will
be successful in the long
run, but experts argue
more action is required.
Politicians have the
unenviable job of balanc-
ing public opinion with
necessary action, yet,
with a recent UN report
suggesting emission cut
targets must be tripled to
limit global heating to 2C
by 2100, these protests
highlight that now is the
time to take big, globally
coordinated steps to
curb our emissions and
save the planet. Across
Europe, climate change is
rocketing up the political
agenda; in Germany some
polls put the Green Party
ahead of Merkel’s CDU,
so whilst politicians have
until now been reluctant
to make bold statements,
with the future of the
planet (and their political
careers) at stake, now
is surely the time to get
serious about tackling
climate change.
