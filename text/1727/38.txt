T
o those who don’t
follow competi-
tive smash, you
may be asking
yourself, who is this guy?
Eric Ler, more commonly
known as ESAM, has been
a part of the Super Smash
Bros. competitive scene
since the Melee days,
sporting his childhood fa-
vourite character, Samus.
Whilst skilled at Melee
and Project M, ESAM’s
legacy truly comes from
his top-level Pikachu per-
formance in Brawl, Smash
4, and Smash Ultimate.
For the non-hardcore
smash players, Pikachu
may just seem like a
projectile spam character,
but the reality is far from
that, with just a glimpse
of ESAM’s performance
against multi-tourney
winner MKLeo, it’s clear
to see that there’s more
to Pikachu than meets
the eye. Despite his profi-
ciency with the character
and presence in the com-
munity, ESAM has never
won a major tournament;
he frequently made top
8s and other respectable
positions but could never
attain true success. Not
only was ESAM unable
to achieve sweet victory,
“ESAM’s legacy
truly comes
from his top-
level Pikachu
performance”
but neither was Pikachu
– leading to most players
dismissing his placement
of the character in top tier.
On September 15th,
2019, that all changed.
with so much experience
and yet so little glory asso-
ciated with his name, like
a true underdog, ESAM
and his Pikachu destroyed
Glitch 7 Singles - the most
recent major tournament
- achieving 1st place for
the first time in his entire
career. ESAM sported
an impressive record
throughout the entire tour-
nament, winning every
set he played: including
against top players such
as the likes of Tweek and
Nairo. Finishing off, he
was faced up against the
Fox player Light, whom
he had beaten 3-1 earlier
in Winner’s Finals. After
a close and tense Grand
Finals, ESAM beat Light
3-2, securing the sweet
victory that he deserved.
ESAM wasn’t the
only trainer to win their
first league this month:
the classic protagonist
of the Pokémon anime,
Ash Ketchum, also won
his first Pokémon League
championship after a long
22 years - despite still
looking like a 10-year-
old. This humorous coin-
cidence has led to a whole
host of jokes paralleling
ESAM’s accomplishment
to that of the fictional
character Ash’s. And just
like with Pokémon, not
only is this a victory for
ESAM, but his fellow
Pikachu too; now Pikachu
finally has results showing
that he can do well at the
highest level, which might
earn ESAM well deserved
support and credit for the
tier placement he’s given
it.
But it doesn’t end there,
singles wasn’t the only
thing ESAM crushed that
day; he also took part in
Doubles, and Squad Strike
- a mode where you play
with a different character
for each stock. In doubles,
he paired with MVD’s
Snake to secure 3rd place,
losing to Dark Wizzy and
Light in 2nd place, and
Tweek and Nairo in 1st
place. In Squad Strike,
ESAM managed to win
2nd place, only losing to
Tweek. Achieving 1st,
2nd and 3rd all in one day
is a phenomenal perfor-
mance, to say the least,
especially within such
a revered tournament!
