London based Jazz
collective Nérija carve out
a small nook of their own
on debut Blume; a feat
increasingly impressive
in London’s ultra-fertile
jazz scene. Influences
from afrobeat and 60s
hard-bop balance to create
a colourful collection of
mid-tempo tunes.
Delving neither too
far into Coltranian solos
nor content to sit within
the confines of a groove,
the backing bends
subtly to the atmosphere
each soloist builds. An
engaging but never arrest-
ing or exhausting energy
pulses through each track.
Saxophonists Cassie
Kinoshi and Nubya
Garcia lay more spacious,
rhythmically driven solos
which prove at times
underwhelming. Sheila
Maurice-Grey’s trumpet
work is more limber, with
dense bursts of melody,
making for a more enjoy-
able listen.
The rhythm section,
whilst musically com-
petent never particularly
shines on Blume. Double
bass hides in the mix,
swathed in heavy cymbal
work on several tracks,
grooves err toward
functionality over depth.
Shirley Tetteh’s guitar
builds sparse or rich back-
drops too - her solo work is
also engaging if undersold
by stale guitar tone. In an
age where electronics and
guitar pedals dominate
both mainstream and
jazz worlds, the coarse
guitar found on tracks like
‘Nascene’ comes off as
lazy, not vintage.
Ultimately, Blume
proves itself an inter-
esting, often beautiful
record, but lacks any real
stellar moments. - MG
with a little. This is mostly
thanks to the beautiful
lyrical and compositional
storytelling used working
in perfect harmony,
showing you don’t need
to say a lot to tell a com-
pelling story.- GR
Speaking about the title
of this new effort, All My
Heroes Are Cornballs,
JPEGMAFIA reflects on
the common internet age
realisation that people
we think of as our role
models are humans
capable of human-level
disappointment. Signifi-
cantly, he stresses the fact
that this goes both ways
- he feels he is bound to
be letting down someone
somewhere at any given
point in time. This album
is somewhat of a response
to that idea, through a
now well-established
PEGGY lens of aggres-
sion mixed with nihilism.
PEGGY is all too aware
that the punch-in-the-
face, noisey, challenging
style that won him so
much critical acclaim
after last year’s Veteran
is what fans have come
to expect. He satirically
acknowledges the irony
of listenability therefore
being a sign of his music
coming short in a series of
promotional videos where
he plays tracks from his
album to contemporaries
he respects (including
James Blake, Slowthai
and Jeff Tweedy). Despite
their praise of his work, he
labels the videos as proof
of their disappointment,
the only exception being
Denzel Curry who is said
to be “satisfied” in the
video title despite trashing
the album and calling it
“Yeezus with hobos”.
Tracks ‘Free the Frail’
and ‘Rap Grow Old &
Die x No Child Left
Behind’ have the clearest
fame-reflective themes on
the albums. The former
is an uncharacteristically
clean moment where
PEGGY attempts to
talk through his strange
and turbulent emotional
response to actually
“feeling employed”. The
instrumental includes a
low, lazy tide of a bass
and pecking synth-drum
claps which alternate
with a more organic
drum refrain. The latter
sees PEGGY rap over a
drilling static that con-
trasts soft keys that come
in for a chorus where he
sings about a “vicious
cycle” where you go from
“Bobby” (presumably
Shmurda - a felon yet a
cult legend) to “Michael”
(presumably Jackson - an
icon with a soiled name).
The album’s lyrical
content goes beyond just a
response to fame though.
PEGGY uses his new
vantagepointtofurther in-
terrogate archetypes in the
weird modern cesspool of
shallow thots and rappers,
music industry soul-suck-
ers, brazen bigots and
internet-dwelling-pseu-
do-liberal closet-racists
and quasi-incels. Through
this all, PEGGY grapples
with his own identity -
his proximity with all
these groups seems to
make him paranoid of
losing the ability to self
define. In particular, his
experiences with the
aforementioned bigots
and internet-dwellers -
two sides to the “cracker”
coin - seem to have made
him hyper-insecure of
his large white fan-base
who genuinely admire his
work and whose support
he is ultimately grateful
for. His obsession with
shooting “crackers” down
therefore seems to be an
overcompensation.
‘Grimy Wifu’, a beauti-
fully composed track that
transitions immaculately
from the previous, sees
PEGGY’s creepy infatu-
ation with confrontation
manifest as romantic
feelings for his gun. A
mellow acoustic guitar
leads the track but a vis-
cously vibrating bass that
lies dormant just beneath
and repeated glitching
embellishments give the
impression of being in the
core of a tornado. ‘PTSD’
which follows on from this
continues this confronta-
tional theme but this time
with the attention focused
on the person PEGGY’s
bullets are aimed at. The
instrumental is beautiful
once again but is more
depressive, precariously
held just above threaten-
ing. It also features one of
the hardest verses on the
album, with the following
brilliant bars: “Your deal
look like Brexit/ biting
crackers and wonder why
you anorexic”.
‘Beta Male Strategies’
earlier in the tracklist is
one of the most sonically
impressive moments of
the album, starting with
a gorgeous, hypnotic
sample that sounds like
an other-worldly paradise.
PEGGY ingeniously plays
with the mixing so that,
when the deathly beat
switch suddenly comes in
and he begins to rap over
it, certain bars spring right
against your ear drums
- “GLOCK WITH THE
DICK”. The title track,
with its deceptively har-
monious glitching synth
winks that sound stellar
over a bass that teasingly
comes and goes, and the
opening track, ‘Jesus
Forgive Me, IAmAThot’,
with its dreamy, watery
synths neatly spliced with
chaotic screaming vocal
scrambles, are similarly
stunning.
Despite the experimen-
tation in places falling just
the wrong side of abrasive,
the ratio of impressive to
bemusing on this record is
overall just right. - AR

INFEST THE RATS’
NEST
A warm breeze, sunset,
and a cold beer with old
friends is the best way
I can describe the way
Whitney’s music makes
me feel. The beat-up
sounding instruments
and Julien Ehrlich’s ev-
er-so-softly sung vocals
give the sound a warmth
and authenticity - that
dewy gooey country
goodness. In my eyes
it captures so perfectly
those fragile little
moments, where it feels
by chance you’ve made it
to the perfect place with
the perfect people, the
summer memories that
stick with you for life.
The country/indie-rock
duo has returned after
three years with a
much more sedated
album about the pivotal
moments in love and life.
Whether falling back in
to love or losing an old
friend, Whitney’s tender
approach helps capture
these moments between
moments. Considering
the subtle nature of much
of the album’s focus the
duo manages to do a lot
tells us of humankind
taking to space to find a
new home. Not comfort-
ing, but perhaps what we
need right now. As gory
as the lyrics are though,
the riffs are pit-inducing,
and I for one don’t mind
head-banging for climate
change action. - EF

FOREVER TURNED
AROUND
In “only” their second
album of the year,
Aussie psych band King
Gizzard and the Lizard
Wizard turn their heads
to climate-strike sup-
portive thrash metal. Not
shy of genre-defying,
ever-evolving albums,
the comparison between
this and their previous
album, the electro-boogie
‘Fishing for Fishies’, is
one of their wildest yet,
a bona fide U-turn of
musical genres. Not shy of
telling a story within their
albums,KingGizzardhave
produced a heavy-hitting
soundtrack to the current
climate crisis, through
their lyrics and fast-paced
noise which is spurring
and urgent, symbolic of
the need to act now and
quickly reverse the dan-
gerous effects of climate
change. Throughout, King
Gizzard paint a picture of
a desolate future: songs
such as ‘Mars for the
Rich’ describe the poorest
left on a deformed Earth;
‘Superbug’ describes the
current lack of new antibi-
otics and the misuse of the
ones we have; ‘Perihelion’
