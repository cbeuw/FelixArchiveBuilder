A Beginner’s Guide to the West End: How to score
cheap (or even FREE!) tickets
One of our Arts section editors shares his experiences and expertise on ways to experience the London theatre
scene on a student budget!

Ozbil Dumenci
Arts Editor
S
tudying at such
a science-based
university, it is
often easy to
forget that London is one
of the world’s art capitals,
with an endless number of
plays, musicals, and ex-
hibitions at our doorstep.
Unfortunately, the theatre
has a bit of a reputation
for being expensive, and
therefore inaccessible for
younger audiences with
limited funds, such as
students.
That’s what I thought
too, at least for the first
couple of years of univer-
sity, spending too much
money on a small number
of shows per year. Now in
my fifth year, people tend
to be shocked when they
hear how often I get to go
to the theatre, and assume
I am a drug lord. The truth
is, I have a few go-to
strategies to ensure I get
the best deal possible for
every show, most of which
are only possible because
I am a student. Read on
for some these tips and
tricks , which will help
you save some money and
enjoy the wonders that
the London theatre scene
(pun intended) offers.
Felix Arts (FREE!)
Yes, number one on
my list is none other
than Felix, the Imperial
College student paper,
the one you’re reading
right now. A majority
of the articles in the
arts section of Felix are
reviews of plays, musicals
and exhibitions (although
we welcome any kind of
contribution if you feel
like it). Twice a month,
we post a list of press
tickets made available for
us to review for upcoming
performances and exhi-
bitions on our Facebook
group (predictably titled
Felix Arts 2019/20). The
members of the group
then get to claim the press
tickets for free. All we ask
for in return is a review
to be published in print
and online. There is no
minimum participation
quota, and as long as you
review what you’ve seen,
you can participate as
often as you like, and as
much as you like!
Rush Tickets
TodayTix is a must-
have mobile application
for any London-based
theatre enthusiast. Not
only do they frequently
offer good deals on
tickets, they release
tickets for select shows
at 10am each day, for that
day’s performance(s),
allowing two tickets per
customer. These tend to
cost £20, and get snatched
up quickly, as there is only
a limited number avail-
able. To maximise your
chances, I recommend
turning the notifications
on for the Rush Tickets
you’re interested in. This
will allow the app to send
you a reminder shortly
before 10 am. As long as
you are ready to add the
tickets to your basket, you
should be all set. Some-
times it’s worth hanging
around on the Rush
Tickets page as any tickets
from other users’ baskets
for which the transactions
weren’t completed get
recycled into circulation.
As of now, Waitress,
Come From Away and
Fiddler on the Roof are
only some of the shows
that participate in Rush
Tickets, but the selection
updates frequently.
Lottery
There are different
types of lotteries which
tendtovaryinpricepoints,
methods, and chance of
actually winning tremen-
dously. TodayTix runs
daily lotteries for various
plays where you can apply
to win cheap premium
tickets (these tend to be
at about £20) throughout
the morning for the day’s
performances. I have
never actually got tickets
this way, but there is no
harm in trying. TodayTix
also runs some weekly
lotteries, most promi-
nently for Harry Potter
and the Cursed Child,
called the Friday Forty,
allocating 40 tickets per
performance for £20 per
part (i.e. £40).
Some shows run their
own lotteries on their
website, such as Book of
Mormon, who also carry
out a daily lottery in front
of the theatre box office.
Day Tickets
Now becoming a bit
old-fashioned, some
theatres ask patrons
to queue early in the
morning for a chance to
obtain cheap, last minute
tickets. These do tend to
be very cheap. Be aware,
though, that these are sold
on a first-come-first-serve
basis, meaning people
tend to queue at ungodly
hours, especially for
shows that are sold out or
very expensive through
their general release, such
as Hamilton. Finally, note
that occasionally, these
are standing tickets. As
long as you don’t mind
standing up for 2.5 hours,
seeing Hamilton for £10
really doesn’t sound like a
bad deal.
Additionally, although
not technically any
cheaper than face value,
it is not uncommon for
theatres to sell return
tickets shortly before a
performance at the box
office. This has proven to
be an effective strategy
for me to see shows that
are otherwise sold out
such as Fleabag and The
Cursed Child.
Student and Youth
Memberships
Some theatres run
special schemes for
students, which has been
a complete game changer
for me. Most importantly,
National Theatre’s Entry
Pass scheme (which is
free to sign up for) for
those between 16 and 25
provides an allocation
of £7.50 tickets (£10 for
guests, who also need
to be between 16 and
25) to every one of their
productions. Additionally,
45 minutes before each
performance, National
Theatre allows those with
a valid student card to
purchase any remaining
tickets for £15, regardless
of their original price tags.
A similar scheme is
present within the English
National Opera titled
“Access All Arias” which
provides cheap tickets
to the opera. (£30 in the
stalls, £20 in the dress
circle and £10 in the upper
circle).This scheme is also
free to join, and anyone
beloww 30 years-old or
those enrolled in full-time
education can apply.
Go Live
Finally, an online
scheme called Go Live
(previously known as
West End for 10) releases
£12 tickets for at least
two shows a month! The
organisation is currently
undergoing significant
changes, therefore keep
your eyes on their new
website when it is finally
live to see what they are
up to.
So, I think not only is
this more than enough
evidence that the West
End can in fact be acces-
sible to all, I hope it en-
courages you to try some
of these out, join our Felix
family, and enjoy some
of the leading theatre
productions in the world
on a student budget!
