Welfare and Fairing Well at Imperial
Your new Deputy President Welfare Shervin Sabeghi provides their advice on staying staying mentally healthy
at Imperial
WELFARE

Welfare. It’s a hot topic
right now, especially at
universities. You often
read horror stories about
welfare issues at univer-
sities in the news, and
many have been forced to
take emergency measures
to protect their students
in response to these. It’s
very much on the agenda
of many institutions, in-
cluding Imperial College,
but what does it all really
mean?AstheDeputyPres-
ident (Welfare), as well
as working to improve
the welfare of students,
I think it’s crucial that I
communicate with you
all about issues going on
to bust myths, set straight
false perceptions, raise
awareness about support,
and keep you in the loop
about various welfare
related topics. This section
in Felix is plays a big role
in this. It’s a place where
all students can write
about things important to
inform their peers about,
and where your reps – be
it Liberation and Commu-
nity Officers, or Welfare
Officers – can talk about
topics involved in their
remits.
Starting with the basics,
let’s define what ‘welfare’
means: “the good fortune,
health, happiness, pros-
perity, etc., of a person,
group, or organisation”
says dictionary.com, and
that pretty much sums it
up. It’s all the things that
come together such that
you are faring well – this
can mean different things
to different people, and
everyone has a different
way of defining when
they’re faring well, and
when they’re not. Uni-
versity, for many, is the
place where they start
properly discovering
what welfare means to
them. Transitioning into
adult life paired with the
pressure of university
responsibilities can be a
big strain on your welfare.
At Imperial, the workload
is high and, let’s face it,
we’re the biggest bunch of
over-achievers you’ll find,
so this strain can be espe-
cially intense as we pile
on the pressure to reach
the heights of academic
attainment we’re used to
reaching before coming
here. Sounds like a bit of
a bleak picture, but don’t
panic, it doesn’t have to
be so. Doing a degree at
Imperial doesn’t have to
be a painful rite of passage
– take it from someone
who’s already done their
4 years! Whilst undoubt-
edly a certain level of
dedication to studies
is required to succeed,
anyone can enjoy their
time here, engage in extra
curricular activities, have
that ever-elusive social
life.
None of that is to say
that achieving this is
easy, in fact it can often
be very difficult. That’s
why, between the Union
and the College, there
are hundreds, if not thou-
sands, of people working
to help students attain
the best welfare they can.
I’m just one of them. The
Your new welfare officer // Union
I lead two networks of
student volunteers: the
Wellbeing Representation
Network consisting of
nearly 100 student reps
across College who rep-
resent the welfare needs
of students, and organise
events to build commu-
nities. I also lead eight
Liberation and Communi-
ty Officers who represent
the four ‘traditional’ un-
derrepresented liberation
areas (LGBT+, Black and
Minority Ethnic, Disabili-
ties, and Gender Equality)
as well as four commu-
nity interests and groups
(International students,
Interfaith students, Ethics
and Environment, and
Mental Health). They run
events and campaigns to
ensure the rights and raise
the voices of these groups,
as well as building their
communities at Imperial.
On the College’s side,
there’saplethoraofpeople
responsible for welfare.
In your departments, you
have your personal tutors,
your senior tutors, and a
variety of pastoral staff
members. In the central
College, there’s the
Student Support Services
who provide central
support like the Disabil-
ities Advice Service, the
Counselling Service, the
Mental Health Service,
the Student Financial
Support Service, etc. You
even have wardens and
sub-wardens if you’re
living in Halls. You’ll
never be able to remember
every single person who
can help you (heck, even
I don’t), but it’s impor-
tant to remember that
someone can help you if
you need it. Never let an
issue get really bad before
you let someone know
about it. And, if you don’t
know where to go to get
help, someone (be it your
wellbeing rep, or your
personal tutor, or anyone
else with a wellbeing
remit) will be able to point
you in the right direction.
As I ascend onto my
soapbox, there’s just one
takeaway I want to make
sure comes out of this
article. Your welfare is
important, and it’s totally
in your power to fare
well at Imperial. It might
not always be easy, but
there are so many people
working every day to
make it easier – and there
will always be someone
to reach out to when it’s
particularly hard. The per-
ception of university life,
especially Imperial life,
being painful is rife, but
it doesn’t have to be so.
Union deals more with
the representation side.
The Deputy President
(Welfare) is the chief
student rep who is respon-
sible for all things welfare
at the Union – I work full
time to represent students
and champion equality,
diversity and inclusion.
“Doing a
degree at
Imperial
doesn’t
have to be a
painful rite of
passage”
“Your welfare
is important
and it’s totally
in your power
to fare well at
Imperial”
Work hard, but have fun –
and keep your welfare at
the forefront of what you
do, however you choose
to define it.
