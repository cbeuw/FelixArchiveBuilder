Physics is dealing
with space problems
by optimising poorly
designed spaces,
rather than moving to
new campuses.
Henry Alman
Editor-in-Chief
T
he Blackett
L a b o r a t o r y ,
home of the
Imperial Phys-
ics department, has
undergone a partial
refurbishment prior to
the new term, including
a new lecture theatre
and computer suite. The
new spaces will open in
October.
Prior to the refurbish-
ment, the computer suite
was heavily outdated:
described as having “a
noticeably stained carpet,
fans blackened with age,
and 60s-era signs remind-
ing students not to smoke
inside – an activity that
has been illegal for over
twelve years.”
The suite has received
new chairs and desks,
group study spaces, a
‘breakout space’ for
relaxation, and a brand
new carpet, among a slew
of new technological
features that cater to
more effective teaching
as well as students with
disabilities. They will also
incorporate a new scheme
where students can book
out department-owned
laptops, so that they can
work on projects at home.
Felix spoke to Michele
Dougherty, the Head of
Department in Physics
who took the reins in
January 2018, and Luke
White, who extensively
liaised with students and
was heavily involved
in the project, about
the refurbishments.
Michele said that she
“didn’t know” why the
refurbishment had not
taken place before now,
having not been involved
with the decision-making
process prior, but that it
was “clear as day” that
it needed work after new
lighting was installed last
summer.
“I was unaware of the
status of the computing
lab when I was not Head
of Department, because I
did not go into the com-
puting lab. I knew what
the lecture theatres and tu-
torial spaces are like, but I
think unless a member of
staff had gone into it, they
probably wouldn’t have
been aware.”
When asked whether
this lack of awareness
on behalf of staff of the
poor quality of student
spaces, and whether the
segregation of student-
and staff-occupied spaces
contributes, she clarified:
“Communication is
always the key, and that’s
one of the things I’ve tried
to do since becoming
Head of Department.
I would much rather
everyone was aware of
the difficult decisions that
need to be made, and that
choices have to be made
– and that’s not always
an easy choice to make.
What I want to try and
make sure we do as a de-
partment is we talk about
it as a department, so
nobody can pretend that
we don’t know that space
needs work.” One of the
first things Michele did in
her new role was opening
up the staff common room
to final-year students to
foster connectivity.
In regards to the ap-
parent lack of action on
necessary refurbishments,
Luke identified a key
problem: necessary ren-
ovations are not always
easy to see. For example,
the building has a legal re-
quirement to update all of
its electrical wiring within
the next two years – a
gargantuan and expensive
task, but one that has no
perceivable benefit to staff
and students. Additional-
ly, the time during which
work can be completed
without seriously disturb-
ing teaching is limited to
summer break – and often
only one or two projects
can be undertaken simul-
taneously without making
the building feel unusable.
Despite these setbacks,
additional revitalisations
to Blackett are being
planned – with student
consultation at the
forefront, once again in
collaboration with Luke
and others throughout the
department. The Student-
Shapers programme, on
this project led by Hunain
Nadeem, has also iden-
tified multiple potential
study spaces, as well as
existing spaces, that also
need a redesign – such as
the infamous ‘Dungeon’
on level one of the build-
ing.
However, he was
also keen to note that
while this is a positive
development, and one
that will be welcomed
by students, it should not
be viewed as a ‘fix’ for
various problems with
Blackett. Physics is home
to around 900 undergrad-
uates, all of whom share a
new computer suite with
120 computers, a small
common room with just
a couple of microwaves,
and study spaces scattered
haphazardly throughout
the lower floors of the
building. The only floor
dedicated fully to student
space is Level 3, out of
12. The facilities and
space dedicated to stu-
dents is, he argues, simply
not sufficient for one of
the largest departments
in the college. Queries
about plans to refurbish
the common room were
met with the immediate
response that the physical
space itself is constrained
– the most that can be
done is replacing furniture
in order to more effective-
ly utilise the space.
Even these types of
positive revitalisations
can come with threats to
what little is available; ac-
quiring funds and support
for improving deeply un-
satisfactory areas comes
with conditions that
could partially counteract
the effectiveness of the
improvement. The new
active learning centre is
one example.
It is a fantastic facility,
featuring high-definition
screens, touchscreen
functionality, multiple
projectors, surround
sound systems, individual
aeroplane-style overhead
lighting, well-spaced
desks so that lecturers
can reach every student
during “classwork”
sessions, plugs and data
connections at every
desk, and more. It is also
allowing the department
to revamp their tutorial
sessions for the incoming
year of freshers, switching
from 20-student groups to
a mixture of 60-person
groups in the active learn-
ing space and smaller
5-person tutorials similar
to what later-year students
currently receive.
However, securing this
for Blackett meant allow-
ing the space to be booked
by any department in the
college to use, further
impacting on the amount
of space available for
physics students at any
one time – although
physics gets priority on
block-booking, and assur-
ances have been offered
that the impact on their
students was carefully
considered and minimised
before the proposal was
accepted.
It’s notable that physics
is one of the few depart-
ments at Imperial whose
undergraduate numbers
have remained approxi-
mately constant over the
last several years. Indeed,
as of yet expanding has not
even been a consideration.
It’s a purely hypothetical
question; the main lecture
theatre can only house 250
students, and so growing
further is impossible. The
department’s stance is that
even if they could expand,
they are not sure they
would want to:
“For me it depends
on whether it improves
the teaching experience
for both students and
staff. I would worry very
much – even if we had the
space – about increasing
student numbers hugely
until we have our student
