“... this is a
great option
for someone
who just
wants to pick
up whatever
game they feel
like playing”
shell out £300-400 for the
newest games console,
nor do you have to own a
4k TV or a custom-built
gaming PC with the top of
the range graphics card.
With streaming, you can
play on the humble phone
since all of the processing
of the game is done by
the respective company
in house – take *that*
anti-mobile gamers.
Moreover, if you do
not care about physically
owning the games then
this is a great option for
someone who just wants
to pick up whatever game
they feel like playing, no
download required. It is
great that people now have
the option to jump straight
into a game without those
dreaded downloads, in-
stallations and updates.
Furthermore, it is, in
fact, a cheaper option
IF you stick to only one
or two of the services,
however, as mentioned
above that is unlikely to
be the case in the future.
All of these positives
are great, and for some
people streaming is going
to be the perfect solution
they have always looked
for, but a lot of gamers
may not look upon this as
kindly.
What Gamers Want
A lot of people who
have grown up gaming
view it as more than just
a hobby. Gaming is a
passion and is something
that people identify with.
Many find joy in owning
and collecting a slew of
games from a variety
of consoles and lining
them up on shelves just
like books. This kind of
gamer is not one to buy
into game streaming, as
the lack of physical own-
ership (or even digital for
that matter) takes away
their enjoyment. This is
pertinent as the Neilsen’s
annual US 360 Report - A
large scale American
survey company - stated
that 66% of people buy
physical games rather than
digital when it comes to
console games. This study
was taken with over 2000
participants and was made
to be representative of
the US population. With
66% of people wanting
physical games, it seems
unlikely that video game
streaming will majorly
pick up steam the same
way TV streaming has in
recent years.
Equally, hardcore PC
gamers probably would
not want to buy into
streaming either. Accord-
ing to the same report,
71% of PC gamers buy
digitally meaning they
are more likely to want to
stream games, however,
when it comes to hardcore
gamers the issue of the
data cap comes back. Any
hardcore PC player will
admit they play far more
than 20 hours a month of
their favourite game so
even if they like the idea
of having games easily
available to them, the
simple lack of bandwidth
would limit them too
much.
There are however
undoubtedly people who
will love the streaming
idea. Those who are more
casually into games and
want to pick up and play
anytime with any game
they fancy will definitely
relish the opportunity to
grab a subscription to a
service. This is with a
similar mindset to how
they would have a Netflix
or Spotify subscription.
What’s the Verdict?
Looking at all the pros,
cons and types of people
that would be interested,
it seems like there is a
growing market out there
for video game streaming,
but it’s just not that large.
This is mainly from sheer
lack of internet availabili-
ty and people still loving
their physical copies of
games. If anything the
most likely course will be
that a couple of the bigger
subscription services
will succeed, and others,
which have caused this
oversaturation, will fade
