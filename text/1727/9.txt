RCSU President
G
reetings, and
welcome to
Imperial!
If you’re
a student studying one
of the natural sciences
(Biochemistry, Biology,
Chemistry, Maths, or
Physics) you’re also a
member of the Royal
College of Science Union
(RCSU).
The RCSU aims to
promote interdisciplinary
interaction within the
natural sciences, and to
create positive change for
our students throughout
the College. We fulfil
these aims by hosting
social and academic
events throughout the year
as well as maintaining
a student representation
network that liaises with
staff. Overall, our goal is
to help you make the best
of your time at university.
If you’re interested in
representing your peers in
meetings with staff, and
putting something nice on
your CV, consider running
for a position as a year rep-
resentative in the autumn
elections. Additionally,
if you’re interested in
writing and/or science
communication, consid-
ering contributing to our
magazine, Broadsheet, or
entering the science chal-
lenge (which has a hefty
cash prize for its winner).
More information can be
found on our website at
www.rcsu.org.uk.
We always welcome
visits from any of our
members if they have a
question, so come and
visit us! There is usually
somebody from the
committee there to help.
We have an office in the
Sherfield building (the
building with the Junior
Common Room in it). If
you follow the walkway,
there is a door next to the
Santander. Walk through
that door and make your
way down the hallway to
find our office.
The RCSU also runs
quite a few events during
Freshers’ Fortnight. More
information can be found
on our Facebook page,
www.facebook.com/
RCSUnion. RCSU events
occur throughout the year
and typically have heavily
subsidised tickets – they
are a great way to have a
fantastic time for a good
price and meet fellow
students along the way.
Lastly, we have our
mascot: a thermometer,
chosen as it is an instru-
ment used by all scien-
tific disciplines, named
Theta. Theta has had a
number of incarnations,
with the current mascot,
Theta Mk.IV, being a
seven-foot steel thermom-
eter weighing over 100
pounds (45 kg). The CUs
regularly try to ‘borrow’
(read: steal) one another’s
mascots as a game, but
the RCSU also keeps an
‘inviolate mascot’ which
cannot be stolen: a Dennis
N-Type fire engine fondly
known as Jezebel.
University, if anything,
is an opportunity to try
new things and meet new
people. You’re only an
undergraduate for so long,
and years certainly do fly
by. I wish you luck with
your university journey
and hope you to make the
most of it. I’ll be writing
here in the CU section
in Felix throughout the
year, so stay posted!

tacted via our Facebook

Chris Carter
RSMU President
H
ey everyone!
I’m Chris
Carter and
this year I’m
serving as President of the
Royal School of Mines
Union (RSMU). This is a
welcome from me to you,
to congratulate you on
meeting your offers and
encouraging you to get in-
volved with the Imperial
community.
The RSMU is one
of four undergraduate
Constituent Unions at
Imperial, and we repre-
sent students studying
Geology, Geophysics,
Earth and Planetary
Science or Materials
Science and Engineering.
If you study one of those
subjects, you’re automat-
ically a member of the
RSMU!
As a Union we have a
variety of functions:; we
support a large variety
of sports clubs which are
open to all students), run
our own events through-
out the year, represent
our members and their
interests at all levels of
the College and Union
decision-making, and
make sure that your time
at Imperial is as enjoy-
able and memorable as
possible.
We have a number of
our own unique traditions,
the most important of
whichisthe‘BottleMatch’
– a weekend of sport and
bitter rivalry between the
RSMU and our nemesis,
the Camborne School of
Mines (CSM) down in
Penryn. This February
over 150 members of the
RSMU will be heading
down to Cornwall for
this fierce competition,
with eight sports teams
participating. Bottle
Match is a great reason
to get involved in one of
our many sports teams,
including: football, rugby,
hockey, cricket, badmin-
ton, and (my personal
favourite) Lacrosse!
We run many events
throughout the year,
and have a great line-up
planned for Freshers’
Fortnight – from mini-golf
and arts and crafts to bar
nights and pub crawls.
We’ll cap the fortnight off
with our annual Freshers’
Dinner, getting dressed up
in formal attire and expe-
riencing some good food.
The Freshers’ Dinner is
a great way to perfectly
finish off the hectic prior
two weeks, where you can
hang out with new friends
and make even more!
That’s all from me
this week, but I and the
other Constituent Union
Presidents will be running
this weekly CU column
in Felix throughout the
year – so be sure to pick
up a copy every week (I
recommend the Puzzles
page as a personal favour-
ite – outside of our own
section, of course!)
