I n v e s t m e n t
Banking. Warren
Buffet. You have probably
heard about several, if
not all these words at
some point in your life.
You don’t know what
exactly goes down, but
one thing’s for sure,
you hear the money is
good. You’re at Imperial
College too, where select
groups consider a summer
internship at a certain
investment bank, whose
name suggest an affinity
of man and gold, to be
the embodiment of peak
performance.
Some years from now,
you will be looking for
a job and the financial
services industry is a
viable and lucrative
option for many hungry
young graduates such as
yourself. “Can I even get
a job in financial services?
I know nothing about it,
shouldn’t an economics or
business student be more
suited?”
Broadly speaking, the
financial services industry
involves a wide array of
fields such as accounting,
asset management, invest-
ment banking, corporate
finance, insurance and the
actuarial profession. The
most popular are asset
management and invest-
ment banking and is the
context of this article.
The goal of asset man-
agement is as the name
suggest, the management
of assets. You’ve probably
heard of Mum and Dad
investing the family’s
savings for retirement
and your expensive
Imperial education, asset
management firms do just
that. The main business
involves making invest-
ment decisions in return
are highly transferable
to other less stressful
but equally well paying
and exciting areas of the
industry. For example,
many of the skillsets of
an investment banker, are
also applicable in venture
capital firms, which
business involves invest-
ing in promising start-ups.
Working in such a firm
could possibly mean
working with, or possibly
having an early stake in
the next exciting firm like
Facebook or Tesla.
Banks do not hire
STEM students
False. Firms usually have
no specific subject criteria
when hiring graduates.
The caveat being,
one’s qualifications must
be from a list of “target”
schools.Target schools are
generally the top schools
within each country/
around the world. A good
reference would be top
members of the Russell
Group universities, which
are described as having the
“…very best research, an
outstanding teaching and
learning experience and
unrivalled links with local
and national business and
public sector”. In theory,
graduates of these uni-
versities have received a
better quality of education
and are therefore, “better”
employees. While there
is a movement to look
beyond superficial qual-
ifications and focus on
skills and experience,
this admittedly elitist
criteria will be around for
some time. But you’re at
Imperial College London,
so don’t fret!
However, certain spe-
cialised roles may have
preferences/requirements
for a specific subset of
degree subjects. For
example, quantitative
roles requiring stronger
numeracy skills will
favour or even require
individuals with a back-
sions of the firm to gain
exposure to the overall
business. Competition is
stiff, since some places on
the graduate program are
offered early to high-per-
forming individuals from
their summer internship
program. Summer in-
ternships range from 9-12
weeks and are a taster
into the life of a full-time
employee. Interns are
worked hard but are also
often well remunerated,
not just with pay, but
also valuable skills and
contacts.
You’d be right to have
deduced the importance
a summer internship
plays in breaking into the
industry. The best way
to land one? Apply to as
many as possible and be
a star applicant. Or join
insight events.
Insight events are
being offered increasingly
by firms to reach out
to students as early as
possible.These are offered
to students the year prior
to their penultimate year
(first-years on a three-year
course/second-years on a
four-year course). These
for a fee and sometimes
a cut of the profits, for
large companies, wealthy
individuals, institutions
like universities and basi-
cally anyone with a large
sum of money and other
assets. Top firms making
the highest and most
consistent returns, attract
many clients and handle
vast sums of money.
Investment banking is
something of a misnomer,
having little to do with the
traditional concept of in-
vesting done by Mum and
Dad. Investment banking
is the process of assisting
individuals, corporations
and even governments in
acquiring funding to grow
or sustain their operations.
They also provide advice

ground in engineering,
physics, mathematics and
statistics. Firms involved
in the pharmaceutical
industry may favour qual-
ifications in medicine,
biomedical engineering
and chemistry.
The sheer diversity of
backgrounds of graduate
hires and interns means
firms often provide a
structured training pro-
gramme to bring all hires
up to speed on computer
skills, basic financial
analysis and company
specific practices. The
most useful skillset to
bring as neophyte is
proficiency in Microsoft
Excel, Word, PowerPoint,
teamwork and the cliché
but important, willingness
to learn
.
Graduate programs,
summer internships
and insight events
Graduate programs
of these firms are the
primary feeder of fresh
talent into the industry.
These programs will
often cycle the graduate
through multiple divi-

Why even a job here
London consistently
ranks in the top 3 on the
Global Financial Centres
Index, indicating a high
level of competitiveness
as a financial centre. It
ranks highly on factors
such as human capital,
business environment,
financial sector devel-
opment etc. Simply put,
London is a great place for
anyone working in finance
as it has an abundance of
opportunity for work with
leading companies and
a great quality of life to
match.
In an article titled
“The 25 Highest Paying
Companies in the UK for
2019” by CNBC, 10 of
them were financial firms,
which included firms
such as Credit Suisse,
Goldman Sachs and
investment management
firm Investec. While
remuneration beyond a
graduate level depends
highly on the firm’s
performance and area of
business, annual incomes
rising above six-figures is
not unheard of.
According to global
jobs site Glassdoor, an In-
vestment Banking analyst
is the highest paying entry
level job in the UK in
2019, with an eye-water-
ing £50,752 median base
salary, nearly twice the
average base salary for a
new graduate in the UK of
£28,088.
The glitz and glamour
of the industry comes
with this caveat, you are
going to have to work
hard for it. Roles that pay
well, demand long hours
and heavy responsibili-
ties. Tales of employee
burn-out are common as
the work can sometimes
be demanding and repet-
itive.
The hardwork at the be-
ginning is well rewarded,
as the skills, networks
and work experiences
companies merge or
when one company pur-
chases another. Funding
is obtained by obtaining
loans and selling “pieces”
of ownership (selling
shares of the company).
Investment banks scour
their contacts to find inter-
ested parties and provide
advice on matters such
as the size of the loan,
the number of shares and
even the timing of these
activities, as wider geopo-
litical events greatly affect
their success.
