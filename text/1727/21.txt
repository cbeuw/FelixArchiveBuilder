Meet the Editors: Eamon - the cool one
S
o you’ve come to
London, rents are
high, a pint costs
£500 and you basi-
cally can’t step out of the
house without breaking
the bank. But it’s all worth
it right? London is a city
of endless possibilities
with a very vibrant arts
and theatre scene... But
where to start?
That’s where I come
in. My name is Eamon,
and I am one of the Arts
Editors this year ready to
deliver some great content
for you! I am currently in
my third year and spend
most of my time enjoying
the food, music and
theatre that London has
to offer. In my free time,
I study Materials Science
and Engineering, but this
is definitely a part-time
hobby.
The Arts section is
here to help guide you
through the most exciting
exhibitions, the most
marvellous musicals
and the most titillating
theatres. With reviews of
shows happening on your
doorstep every week as
well as tips and tricks to
get cheap tickets, you will
become a regular reader in
no time! Take some time
out during freshers and try
to go and visit at least one
museum, there may even
be a couple right next door
to college. Luckily, unlike
the £10 entry to Ministry,
these museums are free
and won’t leave you with
dread and regret!
Whether you’ve ever
engaged with the arts
scene in your hometown
or not, now is the time to
get involved and find out
what you like. Is strolling
through the Tate modern,
looking at some inexpli-
cable sculptures what gets
you going? Do you prefer
watching a Wicked green
witch fly across the West
End sky ? Maybe you
even enjoy the sights and
sounds at an opera… in
Chinese! London has it
all.
I wasn’t necessarily a
connoisseur of fine arts
and theatre before coming
to university but now I’m
hooked. I’ve been to loads
since moving here. Some
have been amazing, some
a little weird, but they
have all been enjoyable
in their own unique way.
Personally, I enjoy art
that really pushes me out
of my comfort zone. The
kind of play, musical or
exhibition that leaves
you thinking about it
and reading around it for
weeks to come. Although
this all sounds a little
highbrow, fear not, my
absolute favourite musical
is definitely Wicked.
Although some might not
see it as the most intellec-
tually stimulating piece of
art, it always puts a smile
on my face!
I really hope you enjoy
our freshers articles this
week and keep coming
back for more. We are
going to work our hardest
to be your one-stop
resource for all things arts
in London!
The truth isn’t always satisfying
T
here’s no doubt
that a large chunk
of the popula-
tion are at least
fascinated by conspiracy
theories. Youtuber Shane
Dawson has compilations
of them on his youtube
channel, each video with
almost as many views as
the British population.
And we all have that
friend who stays up at
night listening to con-
spiracy podcasts. Maybe
you are that friend. Even
if you’re not that friend,
if you don’t believe the
stories, you can definite-
ly have respect for the
meticulous and hard work
that entails working them
out, the eye for detail and
the dedication one must
have. The more of this
seemingly very delicately
worked out evidence there
is, no matter if false, the
smaller the leap of faith
feels between scepticism
and belief.
You name it - there’s a
conspiracy theory about it.
So what happens when you
quite literally put them all
together in a small-scale the-
atre production, hire three
brilliant actors and get a
bunch of amazing props?
You get New Diorama Thea-
tre’s production Conspiracy.
The whole of this 75 minute
play takes place in one room,
yet it travels to New York
Rockefeller Center, Holly-
wood and to the moon and
back. It starts with three peo-
ple apparently preparing to
start recording some sort of
TV segment. They have their
scripts and props ready, and
a microphone propped up
against the middle speaker,
Rose. They start by describ-
ing a photograph the audi-
ence has not yet seen, and
they generate a lot of laugh-
ter in the audience whilst do-
ing so. It is Rose Wardlaw’s
stubbornness and rockhard
subscription to correctness
that renders this scene so
humorous. The play stays
humorous throughout the
duration, even in its dark-
est moments it is a comedy
through and through. After
a few attempts of describing
this photo I think most peo-
ple get an idea of it, and it is
no surprise when the 1932
photo “Lunch atop a Sky-
scraper” is revealed.
I can’t tell whether the
acting or the screenplay is
what takes this play from
mediocre to excellent. At
times I can’t tell if the actors
are still acting or if some-
thing actually went off the
script. It seems to be one of
those shows that evolves, a
few extra jokes added every
night, definitely interacting
with the audience. The best
kind of play. I can’t talk too
much about the plot with-
out spoiling anything, and
I definitely don’t want to
spoil this one. Rose Ward-
law starts off the show as
a strong lead actress, but I
left feeling like it was really
Shannon Hayes that carried
this play over and beyond
with her absolutely amazing
version of Elvis Presley.
Conspiracy is real-
ly easy to watch. It never
gets annoying, weird or
too arthouse-y for the mass
crowd. It’s a bring-your-
friends and have-a-couple-
of-beers kind of lightheart-
ed entertainment. Perfect
for the freshers that want to
venture out in London, to-
wards the dark headquarters
of UCL.
