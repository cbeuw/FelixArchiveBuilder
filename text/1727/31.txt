The intellectual honesty of Robert Mugabe
The Zimbabwean leader stuck to his principles despite immense international pressure. It was
just such a pity what those principles were.

T
o many in the
West Mugabe
was the arche-
typal African
dictator. He came to
power on the back of a
popular independence
movement that prom-
ised to right the wrongs
caused by colonialism
but betrayed the princi-
ples that brought him to
office, enriching himself
at the expense of his
people and cracking
down violently on any
hint of criticism. News
of his death was greeted
in Harare with joy.
However, in other
African nations he is
remembered far more
fondly. Mugabe managed
to gain a reputation for
being a man who stayed
true to his principles
despite overwhelming
pressure from Western
nations intent on interfer-
ing in an African nation’s
future. Despite all that
he did to impoverish his
country, Mugabe’s funeral
was still attended by
past and current African
leaders who came to cele-
brate his achievements.
The reason for this
enduring respect is
not based on a code of
honour among thieves or
a similar support mecha-
nism among kleptocratic
leaders. Instead Mugabe
was honoured for being
a man that had remained
true to his principles, the
ideologies that he had
espoused as a guerrilla
leader in the Rhodesian
Bush War that precipitat-
ed Zimbabwe’s independ-
ence.
These ideologies were
pan-Africanism and
anti-colonialism with an
emphasis on land reform
and following his rise to
power in 1980. It was on
this basis that Mugabe
proceeded rather than the
promotion of democracy
or civil liberties. When
viewed through the
lenses of these ideologies,
Mugabe’s later actions
become much clearer.
Pan-Africanism is the
belief that the fates and
concerns of the black
citizens of all African
nations and the members
of the diaspora are inter-
linked, and that through
‘collective self-reliance’
and unity, a great re-
distribution of strength
and economic power to
Africa can be achieved.
However, central to this
ideal is the notion of
unity, that every black
African, wherever they
are, must rally behind a
single cause. Bastardised
by Mugabe, this was used
not simply to justify a
move towards absolute
state control but was the
very reason for it.
Mugabe had no interest
in a multi-party system.
Indeed, he regarded it
as a Western imposition.
Mugabe was able to
come to power because
the British observer of
the election declined
to disqualify Mugabe’s
ZANU-PF party despite
brazen voter intimidation
because, by representing
the Shona who made up
70% of the population,
it was clearly headed
towards victory. In the
Leninist style, he saw
the democratic process
as a vehicle for realising
his views and remaking
Zimbabwe as a place for
black Africans.
Once in power, the need
for unity necessitated the
suppression of those that
would not follow him.
The best example of this
is the campaign of terror
or Gukurahundi (meaning
‘wind that sweeps away
the chaff before the
rains’) that was launched
against Matabeleland, a
stronghold of the ZAPU,
a rival faction during the
independence struggle.
After three years of
violence the ZAPU were
coerced into merging
(rather than disbanding)
with Mugabe’s ZANU-PF
making Zimbabwe a de
facto one-party state.
The same is true
of Mugabe’s attitude
towards the white farmers
who, as a result of racially
based land allocation
owned 51% of fields, all
of which were suited to
agriculture, leaving the
black majority with only
an infertile and unsuitable
22%. As this imbalance
was a consequence of
colonialism, Mugabe saw
land reform as another
vital aim. Immediately
after his election a policy
of ‘Willing Seller Willing
Buyer’ was launched with
the financial assistance
of the United Kingdom
that pledged to fund half
properties were acquired
before finally elevating
the process above the
judiciary into the purely
political realm did not
succeed in reducing white
control of prime farm
lands.
The 1997 election of
New Labour marked a
change in policy after the
Secretary for International
development announced
“I should make it clear
that we do not accept
that Britain has a special
responsibility to meet the
costs of land purchase in
Zimbabwe. We are a new
government from diverse
backgrounds without
links to former colonial
interests. My own origins
are Irish and, as you
know, we were colonised,
not colonisers.”
Following this
announcement, the
ZANU-PF began drafting
a new constitution that
would permit compulsory
land purchase without
compensation. While at
this point the government
was highly corrupt, the
importance that was
placed on seizing land
from white farmers is
indicative of the impor-
tance that was placed on
expunging the traces of
European colonialism.
This anti-colonial
attitude extended to
accepting help or even
engaging in friendly rela-
tions with those that were
regarded as complicit
in the colonial process.
When Obama exhorted
African nations to be
more tolerant towards
non heterosexuals
Mugabe was reported to
have said that if Obama
cared so much about gay
people, he should come to
Zimbabwe and Mugabe
would marry him. It was
this attitude of defiance
that made Mugabe a
hero to those that saw
the West’s preaching and
aid as a descendent of the
violent imperialism of
earlier generations.
For these reasons,
despite the excesses
of the later years of
Mugabe’s rule, he is
still regarded as an
idealist, who despite the
immense pressure he
was put under, refused
to bow to the white man.
