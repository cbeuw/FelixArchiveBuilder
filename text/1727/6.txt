S e p t e m b e r ,
the Ethos gym
in Prince’s
Gardens was evacuated
after reports of “an un-
usually strong chlorine
smell”. In response, up to
ten emergency vehicles
were called and placed
on standby, while the
surrounding street was
closed entirely.
The building was sub-
sequently attended to by
the fire department over a
period of hours, ensuring
that no dangerous chem-
ical leak or fire had been
the cause.
An Imperial spokesper-
son commented: “the fire
brigade were called yes-
terday following reports
of a unusually strong
chlorine smell at Ethos
Sports Centre. A portion
of Princes Gardens was
briefly closed as a precau-
tion while these reports
were investigated. The
road and Ethos have now
reopened.
The smell was caused
by higher than normal
chlorine levels in the spa
due to a systems fault.
Following a thorough
investigation we have
already put a number
of measures in place to
ensure this cannot happen
again.Aspecialist external
engineer has checked and
signed off all equipment
and confirmed there are no
ongoing safety concerns.”
The nature of the
systems fault is currently
unclear; although meas-
ures were already in place
to prevent such issues
at Ethos, it appears that
an unforeseen combi-
nation of events caused
those measures to fail.
The college has since
reviewed and tightened
those controls.
Staff reportedly had
to leave “without shoes”
as belongings were left
behind in lockers after the
fire alarm went off. The
fire alarm was purposeful-
ly activated by a member
of staff so that the build-
ing would be evacuated,
rather than by the systems
fault itself.
Students were left con-
fused and uncertain, under
the impression that there
was a “gas leak”, after
the evacuation. The only
public notice or statement
from the college was on
the Alerts page - which
was then taken down
once the incident had
been resolved. This has
left some students feeling
frustrated, and concerned
about the ongoing safety
of the sports centre, due
to a lack of information
- when in fact it has been
safe for several days.
