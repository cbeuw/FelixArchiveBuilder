these cameras stack
against each other, it’s
essential to understand
the basics of how cameras
produce images.
The aperture, ISO,
and shutter speed, often
dubbed as the fundamental
buildings of photography,
decide how the image is
produced. The aperture
acts as the “pupil” of the
camera as it controls the
amount of light entering
the sensor. The ISO
decides how sensitive the
camera is to light; i.e., how
bright the photo would be.
Finally, the shutter speed
represents the amount of
time for which the camera
shutter remains open; in
effect, it’s the amount of
time that a camera takes
to capture a photo.
Smartphones often
have fixed apertures, thus
limiting their low light ca-
pability. They overcome
thisbyloweringtheshutter
speed, effectively increas-
ing the amount of light
into the sensor. However,
this poses a problem
as lowering the shutter
speed causes motion blur.
Hence, these cameras
have in-built optical
image stabilization.
Although this solution
makes up for small
hand movements, larger
camera shakes, coupled
with the movement of the
subject(s), would effec-
tively ruin the resulting
photograph. To resolve
this, smartphones turn to
post-processing through
software tricks, such as
“night sight” in Google’s
Pixel and “night mode”
in Apple’s iPhone 11. Al-
ternatively, this could be
fixed through external sta-
bilization methods, such
as gimbals and tripods,
as used by pro-cameras.
However, smartphone
manufacturers target
ease-of-use and minimal
dependence on external
assistance modules.
Another way smart-
phones tackle lighting
conditions is through
machine learning. The
camera captures images
one after another at
multiple exposure levels
and intelligently merges
select photos to create a
well-balanced picture.
Similar software-based
methods are also used
to “stitch” images from
multiple cameras to form
a singular image, such
as those found in the
Nokia 9, a smartphone
with a 5-camera system.
This phone was made
in collaboration with
Light, the company that
made L16, a compact and
easily portable device
that houses 16 cameras.
Together, these cameras
images is felt best through
Google’s Pixel 3. Despite
only possessing a single
rear camera, this phone
has been consistently
ranked as having one of
the best modern smart-
phone camera systems.
On the flip side, DSLRs
and mirrorless cameras
have greater flexibility
in manual control and
possess a vast array of
lens choices. Their raw
capability to capture
photos in almost any
lighting environment out-
weighs the software tricks
used by smartphones.
However, the conven-
ience and affordability
of smartphones cameras
remain unmatched.
Lens Choices in
Smartphones
The multiple camera
system isn’t just used for
zoom purposes. Many
popular camera systems
today use a third wide-an-
gle camera to capture a
wider scene. Other camera
options include mono-
chrome and time-of-flight
cameras. A monochrome
camera is used to boost
the image quality through
software manipulation as
it captures the highlights
and shadows while a time-
of-flight camera captures
depth information and is
essential for immersive
augmented reality experi-
ences.
Uniqueness in
Camera Systems
As smartphone man-
ufacturers increase the
camera count on their
camera systems, the
factor of uniqueness in
their products decrease.
To make up for this,
they resort to additional
features that serve as
methods to lure custom-
ers to their brand. For
example, increasing the
megapixel count of the
cameras, introducing
different lighting modes,
using machine learning
to adapt the camera to the
scene, and providing the
end-user with control over
the post-processing of the
image.
Again, this “healthy
competition” has driven
an immense improvement
in the production of
high-quality innovative
camera modules. A recent
example is the intro-
duction of folded optics
camera systems, which
allow for optical zoom in
the range of 5x to 10x.
An aspect that manu-
facturers heavily focus on
is the shape of the camera
system. With the number
of cameras increasing
year after year and phones
looking more alike than
ever, the arrangement
of cameras has slowly
started to serve as brand
identifiers.
Conclusion
As a result, the smart-
phoneisstartingtobecome
increasingly centered
around its camera system.
What started as an added
selling point has now
sparked a race for mobile
vendors to compete in and
fight to lead the n-camera
smartphone trend.
