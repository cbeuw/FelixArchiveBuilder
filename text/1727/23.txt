Fame the
Musical is all about that
desire to be recognised, to
be known, to not fade out
of existence when death
takes hold. While based on
a film from the 1980s, that
desire is just as relevant
today. “I’m Gonna Live
Forever” is the refrain of
our protagonists - talented
teenagers aspiring to a
career in the performing
arts, who while facing
the challenges of growing
up, must also bare their
souls in their respective
professions. Musicians,
actors and dancers alike
come together to share
their stories in the new
West End adaptation of
the beloved film, TV show
and musical.
Outside of the famous
eponymous theme song,
the songs of the musical
themselves are not as well
known. After the amusing
auditions where the
promising youngsters are
barely given five seconds
to show their worth,
the opening song “Hard
Work” sets the tone for
the rest of the first act. The
starry-eyed students, with
their heads full of dreams,
are, if you excuse the pun,
given their fifteen minutes
of fame in songs like “I
Want to Make Magic”,
“Can’t Keep it Down”
and “Let’s Make a Love
Scene”. Stephanie Rojas
is a particular standout
as Carmen, leading the
lunch jam sequence in the
celebratory “There She
Goes/Fame”. Jamal Kane
Crawford as Tyrone plays
the troubled and angry
African American teen
stereotype perfectly, but
this is where Fame the
Musical starts to show its
age. Other stereotypes in
the musical such as the fat
funny girl, the class clown
and the sensitive artist
are outdated, sometimes
insulting and not very
original.
The second act is
the stronger of the two,
where life and their
ambitions do not always
go to plan. Simon
Anthony as Schlomo is
excellent here, as is West
End debut Alexander
Zane as live-trumpeter
and comic Goody. The
actors get their chances
to shine in numbers like
“In LA” and “Dancing
on the Sidewalk”, which
although not especially
memorable, again allow
for some strong perfor-
mances. Mica Paris steals
the show with “These Are
My Children”, describing
her motivations behind
the assumed toughness of
this homeroom teacher.
Whilst the final song of
the musical is a moving
one, we as the audience
are indulged in the encore,
where the whole cast
brings the crowd to their
feet to join in the epony-
mous theme. It’s a chance
to let go, sing, dance and
have fun with some of the
most talented youngsters
on the West End this
season.
If you’re looking for an
enjoyable evening, Fame
will leave you dancing the
night away. You might not
remember the minutiae,
but you will remember
how it makes you feel.
It’s a musical of hope, of
dreams and as succinctly
put by Billy Porter at the
Emmy Awards: “of love”.
It makes you think of your
own goals, your own as-
pirations, as these young
people are similarly trying
to make their mark on the
world – life does indeed
imitate art. As a university
of STEM students, these
may not be totally relata-
ble to dancing or singing
on Broadway but may just
give you the groove in
your step to start the day
right.
H
ailing from a
stellar run at
the Edinburgh
Fringe Festival
is ‘Rouge: A Circus for
Grown Ups’. And it is a
truly spectacular show.
The award-winning
Australian production is
a celebration of jaw-drop-
ping acrobatics, cheeky
burlesque and charming
cabaret that was both
sensual and gorgeous.
Overflowing with con-
fidence and sass, each
performer filled the
theatre with their own
unique charm, and often
sent the audience into
fits of laughter and pure
joy. Alongside the perfect
injection of tongue-in-
cheek (and occasionally
naughty) humour, the 70-
minute show passed in a
blink of an eye and left us
wanting more.
Whilst each short act
seemed disconnected
from each other, overall
the acts worked together
to expose the audiences
to various facets of
burlesque and cabaret.
Included were death-defy-
ing acrobatics that left the
audience gasping in shock
and heaving sighs of relief
as the performers com-
pleted their immaculate
routine. There was even
some involvement of the
audience members with
the acrobatics – it kept
us on our toes! However,
some audience partici-
pation was uncalled for:
one woman decided to go
up on stage, attempting
to touch the performer
without permission.
She was rapidly (and
smoothly) shuffled off the
stage by another perform-
er, much to our chagrin
and amusement.
Things were kept
light-hearted with the
performer’s cheeky
winks, slapstick humour
and general sassiness.
One entire song had a
performer enthusiastically
dancing with a lampshade
on her head, mimicking
the lyrics of David
Guetta’s ‘Turn Me On’.
The performance then
built on this theme, with
subsequent partially-nude
acts using the lampshade
to maintain the perform-
ers’ privacy. We were
often left roaring with
laughter as the perform-
ers took bites of carrot
strapped to a performer’s
underwear, whilst another
got his pants pulled down
(they were careful not to
flash us though!).
Whilst funny, the true
highlight of the show
was the acrobatics. We
witnessed core strength
that one can only aspire
to, with the performers’
flexibility and muscula-
ture being those made
of dreams. We can only
laud the performers’
ability and skill, alongside
their ability to blend
these acts in with sexier
ones. Throughout, they
maintained a charm and
stage presence that left us
smiling, with their infec-
tious energy and passion
rolling onto us.
‘Rouge’was a show that
left the audience feeling
thrilled and empowered.
A truly decadent blend
of acrobatics, cabaret
and burlesque, it is easy
to see how this show is
the Weeklies winner Best
Circus Adelaide Fringe
2018 and Fringeworld
2019. It was an endless
celebration of all things
passionate, operatic and
borderline inappropriate.
I could not have imagined
a better way to spend an
evening, for it was a true
sensation to behold.
