Horoscopes*
Scorpio
This is made up. Don’t tell Mystic
Meg, she’ll have to go back to sucking
cock for heroin. I have a particular hate
against you this week. You fucking, arse
wipe disgrace of an excuse for a human
being. I want to pluck your pubic region
hair by hair. And sterilise it with whisky.
Aries
You’ve slept badly. You should really
have had that shit before going to bed.
You get up at 7am and drop the kids
off at the pool. Ah, the satisfaction, the
weightlessness.And then... Whiiirrrrrr...
fucking fire alarm!! You’ll get a £100
fine. Thankfully the shit was worth it.
Taurus
So, it’s Issue 1499! The big 1499. That’s
right! Oh, wait, the Editor wants to keep
the build-up going until issue 1500.
Wtf. Just because a number is suitably
rounded, doesn’t make that issue any
different. Why not just wait until 1501?
What a fucking dickwad.
Gemini
What sort of person would hide behind
an anonymous veil to write hatred drivel
about other columnists? What a pathet-
ic, sad person you must be. You vagina.
I fucking hate cowards. I also fucking
hate Ken Livingstone, Lewis Hamilton,
and Diane Abbott. Go jump off a cliff.
Cancer
Born on the 28 June? Blonde? Tory?
Well, this week, all will go badly for
you unless you come to the Felix of-
fice and suck Hangman’s Cock (yes, it
is capitalised, cos it’s so huge). You do.
While saying something about hating
Dale Farm; it makes it more arousing.
Leo
So, you walked out of the RSC’s pro-
duction of Marat/Sade. You couldn’t
take the nudity or torture. Come to the
Felix office at 1am this Saturday and I’ll
show you a proper bit of Shakespeare.
I’ll shake my spear at you, sir1

Virgo
Just when I was running out of wank
material, not only does Louise appear
on TV, Gaddafi goes and gets shot. And
there’s footage of it! Nothing beats a
dead dictator wank. Recall Saddam’s
death erection? Nothing quite like a
post-mortem erection. Sexy.
Libya
To the powers that be: we want a tour to
Libya. We need a translator, bullet proof
vests, helmets, a crazy taxi driver, and a
phrase book. And Gaddafi’s gold plated
balls. Imagine the Features we could
do. We fucking dedicated a horoscope
to you. Go on.
Sagittarius
I never found Have I Got News for
You any good. And then I saw Louise
Mensch on it. Google her, she’s fit. She
could mensch my cock. Nothing beats a
fit, obnoxious Tory. Except for my cock.
Who’d have guessed BBC 1 9pm on a
Friday was perfect wank bank material?
Capricorn
Apparently the Student Union
President at Liverpool University didn’t
appreciate our Cancer horoscope last
week. He thinks he represents the views
of all students.
Well, we think he should go fuck
himself.
Aquarius
Last week we cracked a joke about latte
drinking socialists in this space. Louise
Mensch must have seen it. She used
the joke on HIGNFY. It bombed like
an enthusiastic NATO ‘peacekeeper’.
We’re sorry. Our jokes aren’t that well
thought out. Can we make it up to you ;)
Pisces
THIS IS FUCKING ATROCIOUS. US-
ING EMOTICONS IN THE HORO-
SCOPES!!! While I’m at it, can we
please STOP having fucking religious
pieces in the comment section. NO
ONE GIVES A FUCK. Let’s just all be
friends. Now, suck my balls.
HANGMAN
*Believe them and your arse is mine. Louise Mensch, I hope you’re reading.
careers advisor (n.)
1. Person who is unable to get a proper
job and whose prime role is to ironi-
cally suggest career paths to spotty-
faced undergraduates.
2. Proof that people who can’t take
advice always seem to be the best at
dishing it out - see also Your Mum (n.)
3. Person you should never ask
for careers advice. They will stop
you seeking your dreams or doing
anything unrelated to your degree or
banking. This is because they lack all
imagination.
4. One level above unemployed on the
career ladder. With added pity.
beard (n.)
1. The ultimate sign of either manliness
or laziness. Go ahead, shave the mous-
tache to convince yourself that it’s the
former. Now you look like a member of
System of a Down.
2. “Bear’d”: a popular Russian Punk’d
spin-off where an Ashton Kutcher look-
alike sets a bear on unwitting Russian
celebrities, with hilarious and fatal con-
sequences. Why do you think nobody’s
heard from the t.A.T.u. twins recently?
3. The one thing you should never see
on a girl. Seriously, I once saw a girl
who apparently neglected her face dur-
ing exams and looked like a yeti by the
end of the term.
titanic (n.)
1. What your penis definitely isn’t,
as evidenced by your ability to wear
skinny jeans that belong on a girl.
Jeans are too tight when they begin
castrating you, just FYI.
2. Your mate, who gets told by her
friends that her lovely blue eyes are
her best asset. Should do some sport.
Will swallow, if only for the calories.
3. “Doing a Titanic” - getting 2,223
people to go down on you. Getting hit
by an iceberg is optional, not recom-
mended but bloody spiffing banter.

OF THE WEEK
The fetal position isn’t going to help you now you know. What would your parents say? Find out next week when
they see the copies we sent them. It could be worse, guy-on-the-right, at least you’re wearing FCUK boxers – nice
