set of kitchenware, by Lakeland
Ingredients
2 poussins
8 eggs
100g minced chicken breast
¼ lettuce
1 sprig spring onion
3 cloves garlic
1 lemon
3 tbsp mayonnaise
3 tbsp olive oil
3 tbsp white wine
3 tbsp red chilli powder
2 tbsp dried basil
Recipe
First, hard boil the eggs. We shall re-
turn to these later.
To prepare the marinade, first crush
the garlic. Mix the basil in a bowl
with the garlic. Squeeze half a lemon
into the bowl. Add the white wine
and the olive oil.
Now unwrap and untie the pous-
sins and clean them with boiling
water. Apply the marinade over the
poussins and inside the cavity. Op-
tionally, the poussins may be left to
marinate for a few hours.
Now, peel the eggs. Insert one into
each poussin. Put the poussins in the
oven in a roasting dish, uncovered,
at 190°C and cook for 40-45 min-
utes. Be sure to baste regularly with
their own juices, so that they don’t
dry out.
Halve the remaining eggs and
carefully remove the yolks, plac-
ing them in a bowl. Add to the bowl
the minced chicken breast, spring
onions, mayonnaise, chilli pow-
der. Mash together to form a paste.
Spoon the paste back into the egg
whites, into the space left by remov-
ing the yolks.
Prepare the plates by covering
them with a bed of lettuce. Once the
poussins are done, place one on each
plate and surround with the finished
eggs.
Enjoy served immediately with a
chilled bottle of sauvignon blanc and
an open mind.
“Man has for millennia strived to answer the age-old philosophical question:
which came first, the chicken or the egg?
Now, at the peak of our civilisation, with the tools of science and technology
at our hands, we no longer need ask this question.
Our brutal taming of nature has rendered the question irrelevant. For here,
we lay before you an allegorical spectacle, a feast for the senses, in whose
shadow all philosophical trifles are moot. We present to you The Which Came
First.”

Crispy Pork Belly
Ingredients
A slab of pork belly
Salt
Ground white pepper
Sesame oil
Herbes de Provence
Rosemary herbs
Recipe
Preheat the oven at 200°C for 15min.
Rinse the pork belly, dab dry the pork
belly, especially the skin.
Mix the salt, pepper, and sesame oil
in a bowl. Coat the skin evenly with the
mixture.
Take the time to sprinkle some Herbes
de Provence and Rosemary herbs onto
the skin.
Place the pork belly on an Al foil with
skin faced up. After 20min, nudge the
pork belly to ensure it doesn’t stick to
the Al foil.
Put the pork belly in again and heat
for another 15-20min. The pork belly is
ready when the skin has turned golden
brown and looks crispy.
Carve up the meat and the crispy skin
separately to be served.
