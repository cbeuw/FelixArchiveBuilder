Club Captain Interview:
Snooker
Indy Leclercq
Our aim this year is
to break into the top
eight, and compete
with the ‘big’ teams
Sports Editor
We continue our Club Captains inter-
view series this week with a sport that
many people have heard about or even
seen on television but that tends to keep
a low profile amongst Imperial’s sports
clubs - snooker.
Elwin Carlos, a third year physicist, is
this year’s ICU Snooker club president.
We meet in Beit quad for the interview,
and he turns up in full matchday attire -
waistcoat, bow tie and all. He takes me
up to the third floor of the union, where
the snooker rooms reside, to conduct the
interview and take some pictures.
The rooms are impressive, boast-
ing four full-sized tables - which are a
lot bigger in real life than on BBC2. I
point this out, and Elwin smiles. “Most
people tend to be surprised about how
much the television shrinks the tables
- it’s all camera angles”. The whole
place seems to be a pretty well-guarded
secret, but Elwin wants more people to
come along. “We organize beginners’
coaching sessions on Tuesday nights, so
people can come along and discover the
sport, even if they’ve never held a cue
before”. He offers to let me shoot some
balls, but I decline - I would definitely
need some coaching first!
We begin the interview proper, and I
start by asking about the snooker club’s
recent achievements. “We’re currently
defending BUCS Trophy champions,
having won the second-tier competition
of the BUCS Snooker Championships
for the past two years”.
The snooker season revolves around
one tournament held as part of the
BUCS nationals events in March: the
twenty-odd university teams participat-
ing are divided into four groups. The
top two of each group qualify for the
Championship knockout tournament,
while the third and fourth-placed teams
compete for the Trophy.
Elwin is clear about the club’s ob-
jective for this season: “At the mo-
ment our first team is ranked 9th in
the country. Our aim this year is to
break into the top eight and compete
with the ‘big’ teams: Cardiff, York,
Manchester, Southampton, Warwick,
QUB, Nottingham and Kent. We have
two or three guys capable of making
big breaks, so I think we have a pretty
good shot this year.” He sounds con-
vincing, and I’m inclined to believe
that they’ll manage this year after
coming so close in previous editions.
This prompts the question, though:
what does preparation for the BUCS
tournament involve?
“We just had team trials last week,
which we use to gauge the standard of
the new people at the club. However,
seeing as we only have the BUCS
tournament in the second term, who-
ever is playing best at the time will be
in the team. We also have an internal
league in which members compete for
the prestige of being the best player in
the club.”
On top of that, ICU Snooker now
has a professional coach coming in for
the first time in their history. “We’ve
brought in Patsy Fagan. He was the
UK champion in 1977 and is an ex-
world number 11 – he comes down to
our club on Thursday nights to help us
improve our skills,” says Elwin enthu-
siastically. What, then, does it take to
be a good snooker player? The snook-
er president smiles knowingly at this:
“it takes a few weeks to pick up the
basics, how to hold a cue, how pot a
ball...but to go from that to being able
to make big breaks, it just takes hours
and hours of practice.”
I gather that Elwin has been put-
ting the hours in at the table, then. I
ask him how he got into snooker, and
it turns out that he really came into
his ball-pocketing stride at Imperial:
“From a young age I’ve always been
interested in snooker, but before Im-
perial it only went as far as having a
small table from Argos in my garage
and practicing on my own or with my
brother. I only started taking it seri-
ously when I got here – I was a com-
plete amateur when I arrived. In two
years I’ve gone from struggling to pot
about 2 balls in a row to potting 20
balls in succession, which I managed
for the first time a couple of weeks
ago.” Although all sports take prac-
tice, the facilities at Imperial seem
pretty top-notch, and it’s pretty easy
to come and play a few frames during
lunchtime - with or without a bow tie.
The snooker club also sends an
8-ball pool team to the BUCS cham-
pionships - something of a revival,
apparently. I ask what the main dif-
ferences are; surely a team of snooker
players have the required skills to
compete in pool?
“Ah, sure, the skill set is very simi-
lar but in terms of tactics there are
some important differences. In pool
you need to be slightly more careful
about where your cue ball ends up af-
ter a shot. You have to be careful in
snooker too but with pool, being reck-
less will often lead to your opponent
potting 6 or 7 balls in a row to win a
frame.” Duly noted. He also tells me
that the club organizes free trips to Ri-
leys Victoria, a local pool hall, every
week.
Any parting thoughts? Half-jok-
ingly, half-seriously he breaks into a
smile: “Sometimes it feels like I’m
sacrificing my degree to play snook-
er.” Is it worth it? “Definitely.”
