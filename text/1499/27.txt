Arrest yourself for not developing a love for this show
It was recently announced that a new
series of Arrested Development is in the
works and will be aired at some point
in the future. The plan is to then make
a film. If you are anywhere near as big
an AD fan (as those in the know call it –
although it does make it sound a bit like
a disorder) as I am you will have flipped
your shit, I believe that is the technical
term. Don’t worry, that is purely meta-
phorical shit-flipping going on.
The show centres on a family called
the Bluths. Michael Bluth (Jason Bate-
man) is very much the most normal
member of the family. He has to become
the President of the Bluth Company,
a property developer, after his father
George Bluth Snr. (Jeffrey Tambor) is ar-
rested. The general trials and tribulations
of the eccentric Bluth family become the
centre of the show. The show also has a
narrator (Ron Howard – also the show’s
creator) who really is almost a character
in his own right and is used astutely to
create hilarity.
Why the big fuss about this? That’s a
very good question, I’m glad I wrote it
(I’m in a smug mood). Well, basically,
AD is an awesome show that’s absolute-
ly hilarious. It’s immensely quotable in a
truly unique way. It has all of these great
catchphrases, in-jokes and call-backs
that are impeccably put together, whilst
at the same time not feeling forced. It’s
those three things that really gave (dare I
say gives) the show its strength. For ex-
ample, in one episode they set a couple
of scenes at Burger King, repeatedly say
the name “Burger King” and even have
a character call it a “wonderful restau-
rant”. The reason for this was that they
were asked to set a scene in Burger King
as part of a promotional deal that the net-
work had with them. So, they sarcastical-
ly over-emphasised the advertising. It’s
these Easter egg moments like that, and
spotting some subtle joke or call-back
that make it so re-watchable.
There is however one slight problem
that I have with the show returning for
another series: the current 3 series are
so good that I don’t want the show to be
tainted by a bad 4th series. I’m not say-
ing it will be bad, but I can’t help having
this worry that it will somehow ruin the
show for me. It’s stupid for me to think it,
absurd even, but it does, for some reason
that is difficult to explain: it will make
rewatching the earlier episodes less en-
joyable knowing that it show declines
later on. I’d say that my feeling about the
return are a mix between cautious opti-
mism and mild worry – a bit like the con-
stant feeling during exam period. I voice
this mix of emotions here because a) I’m
a pretentious twat and b) I think that this
view is not too uncommon amongst AD
fans (finally, for once, I’m normal – ah
man, now this view is mainstream, I
must immediately reverse my opinion).
Way too many TV shows have made
the mistake of dragging on for too long,
or doing one too many “specials”, that
turn out to only be special in the more
derogatory sense of the word. In fact, in
terms of the absolutely classic example
of this phenomenon, The Simpsons is
still making this mistake and will be
for another 2 series of legacy destruc-
tion. Family Guy is another possible on
going example. Basically, most sitcoms
make this mistake: they overstep the line;
they keep doing the same thing a few too
many times; and give the audience more
of the thing that everyone proclaims they
wish they did more of. The trouble is,
people like the idea of more of the same
and usually don’t actually like the reality
of it. It’s a bit like when you go out: the
Tim Arbabzadah idea of drinking another double vodka
coke (I know, I exude masculinity) is
fantastic, but when you grant yourself
the wish you end up regretting it the next
morning. Although, the analogy doesn’t
extend that much, I don’t think I have
ever regretted sending a TV show a text
that felt like a fantastic idea at the time.
It seems like that paragraph went off
on a bit of a ‘y = sin(x)/cos(x)’ yes, I
made that joke. No, I promise to never
do something as horrific again, you can
keep reading in safety. The next para-
graph will have returned to normality.
The thing that attracts people to the
idea of something being done more is
exactly why it shouldn’t be done. The
thing they like loses its mystique. It’s no
longer special and rare, it’s lost a large
part of the appeal. How many expensive
collectors’ items are commonplace? To
use Family Guy as an example, everyone
loves the original couple of Brian and
Stewey episodes. If every episode were
to be like that, then it would no longer
be a rare treat that you occasionally get
given and gratefully receive.
4th wall breaking paragraphs including
terrible jokes and amateur TV watching
psychologist impressions aside – let’s
get back to AD. All of the characters
are funny, and picking a favourite is al-
most impossible. I’m personally a big
fan of G.O.B (Will Arnett), Michael’s
older brother, an amateur magician who
prefers to travel around on a Segway.
Although I always find Tobias (David
Cross) is guaranteed to make you laugh.
It seems that AD is fairly popular
amongst the acting community, if the
cameo appearances are used as a judg-
ing mechanism. Ben Stiller plays Tony
Wonder, GOB’s arrogant rival, another
magician. Charlize Theron has a story
arc in the 3rd season as a love interest for
Michael. For reasons that will become
clear after you watch the show (because
you are going to watch it aren’t you? I
will not reveal anything else about her
character).
Talking about Charlize Theron’s char-
acter has reminded me of yet another rea-
son why the writing is so clever. When
you re-watch the show, you see things
you didn’t notice before that you kick
yourself for not realising. It’s like be-
ing at a live Derren Brown show when
he does one of the big reveals at the end
and shows you a video where he winks
at a camera. For instance, Buster has a
plot line (again no spoilers) that is very
cleverly foreshadowed in some scenes.
What more can I say? Quite a lot actu-
ally, but I don’t really have space. I think
I must give a quick, honuorable men-
tion for Henry “The Fonz” Winkler who
plays the family’s hilarious, inept lawyer.
That’s the thing, it’s an ensemble cast,
but all the characters are well developed,
interesting and expertly portrayed.
To sum up: it may be returning soon,
the first 3 series are amazing in all ways
and you will be hooked once you get into
it. The only down side is your conver-
sations with friends will involve more
quotes/references than they should, as
will your Felix articles. Try and avoid
this, it’s a HUUUUUGE mistake.
Any more punny headlines and I’ll be forced to hand myself in...
A bunch of typical Imperial students
Eccentric isn’t the word...
“It seems like that
paragraph went off
on a bit of a y =
sin(x)/cos(x). Yes, I
made that joke.”
Think
you
could
write
a
review?
It
doesn’t
matter
if
you
think
you
couldn’t!
We’re
getting
pretty
desperate
now.
Seriously,
email
tv.felix@ic.ac.uk!
(You
may
now
return
your
head
to
its
normal
position.)
“...special in the
derogatory sense of
the word.”
