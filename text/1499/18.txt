U
nless you’ve been liv-
ing under a rock, or hid-
ing out in a sewer for the
last week, you’ll know
that everyone’s favourite
Northern African whack job Muammar
Gaddafi is dead. To this I say – good rid-
dance. I shall miss you about as much as
I do my ingrown toenail.
Now, unless you’re a Libyan rebel, you
might find this viewpoint somewhat of-
fensive. ‘Surely’, I see you write in the
Comments section, ‘this man should
have been put on trial? Does this not
mark the beginning of a doomed, blood-
thirsty Libyan government?’ Well, no, it
doesn’t.
‘But surely an eye for an eye makes
the whole world blind?’ I’ll come to this
point later, but Gandhi’s argument isn’t
going to sway me on this issue. Gaddafi’s
dead; and I, for one, will not be shed-
ding any tears or laying down criticism
against either the National Transitional
Council or the rebels that captured Sirte.
This man was one of the monsters who
ruled over Libya for over four decades.
One should appreciate that he was not
alone; no one human can run a country
without advisors, and Gaddafi had a lot
of them. At the end of the day though,
the buck stopped with him. He was, in
effect, the system, and all the atrocities
committed both in Libya and throughout
the world via Libya-sponsored terrorism
lead back to him.
With a pained expression I read the
comments on the BBC page when it

Offended? I really don’t care...
Good riddance Gaddafi
was announced that Gaddafi had died in
crossfire: ‘So this is how Libya wishes
to start its new era of freedom.....with
a murder and a lie. Interesting’, ‘So we
liberate Libya for a Government which
is blatantly lying despite all the evidence
on the Internet? This is not a good start
to a free Libya.’ Oh God, stop being so
white and middle class, it’s hurting my
brain. I will say that it’s blatantly obvi-
ous that Gaddafi was deliberately shot by
rebels and not caught in crossfire; his au-
topsy revealed he was killed by a bullet
to the head, and this would have occurred
whilst in the midst of some rather angry
Libyans. The NTC should have just gone
ahead and admitted that passions had run
wild – no one with a shred of intelligence
would begrudge them.
This was not the killing of a tyrant by
a truly organised fighting force. This was
the killing of a tyrant by the very people
he’d oppressed and beaten down, people
whose emotions were running sky-high
when they found him hiding like a rat
in a sewer (oh the irony). Many of these
rebels would have lost family and friends
to the man now begging for mercy at
their feet. If I’d have been in their shoes,
I can’t say I’d have been prepared to ar-
gue for his life.
An eye for an eye does make the whole
world blind, it’s true. But in this case, I
firmly believe that a bullet to the head
was the correct medicine to prescribe.
No court he could have been tried in
would have been fair. You are a fool to
think anyone would pass a completely
I
n just over a year at this great in-
stitution, I have never felt driven
to write to Felix to express my
views in response to any article.
But I was genuinely riled this
week by the comments and general sen-
timent towards a critique of the show
that encapsulates all that is wrong with
British Society: The Jeremy Kyle Show.
Now it was the pure and unadulter-
ated hypocrisy of a number of people
who commented online that perturbed
me. From comments such as ‘you class-
less moron, you’ (I suggest a lesson in
English grammar before you publish
your next column…) and ‘[makes me]
ashamed to be at Imperial’, it appeared
that a handful of self-righteous liberals
had come out in force to oppose an arti-
cle that made some bloody good points.
It is this armchair socialism that real-
ly drives me up the wall. Here we have
people, enrolled at an elite University,
and probably typing on their brand new
Macintosh computer whilst sitting in
their west London house, who feel they
need to be offended by proxy for the
guests that feature in this show.
If you have such qualms with the
class system of the UK, why are you
still enrolled at a university that has as
its modus operandi “Scientia imperii
decus et tutamen.”? (This, for those of
you not fortunate enough to have had
a classical education bestowed upon
them, means: “Knowledge is the adorn-
ment and protection of the Empire”.)
Enough said.
Just watching one episode of the
aforementioned show will highlight
the appalling situation that ten abysmal
years of serially incompetent socialist
Labour government has created. People
in a cycle of poverty, living drug and al-
cohol addled lives whilst fuelling reck-
less and unsustainable consumerism
funded by the honest, hardworking tax-
payer. You only need to drive through a
council estate (yes, I did do this once)
to notice that they have the highest
density of satellite dishes per street and
the highest number of new cars (with
blacked-out windows of course) than
any other residential area; I wonder
where all the money comes from?
The crux of this problem is in atti-
tude. What we have here is a genera-
tion of people who feel they have some
God-given entitlement to a roof over
their heads, filled with all the trappings
of modern consumerist culture, whilst
they need not lift a finger to contribute
to a society that is subsidising their ex-
cesses.
So yes, indeed, I do ‘blame the indi-
vidual’. It is their life to live, and their
life that they have royally screwed up.
I wonder how many of them would be
proclaiming the greatness of the gov-
ernment if they ever made it anywhere
in life.
And finally, to those who try to palm
impartial, unbiased judgement on him
if he remained in Libya. Guilty was the
only judgement that could ever have
been passed, and the whole thing would
have been a complete and utter farce –
one only has to look at Mubarak’s trial
to see what would happen. A protracted
trial would have only delayed progress;
a clean kill immediately cleared the way.
No Gaddafi, no old system, simple as.
He died before he could leave another
impression; he did not die a martyr. The
whole world, including his old support-
ers, saw him hide like a rat and killed like
a dog – so much for fighting to the last.
On 20 October 2011 his former govern-
ment was completely and utterly annihi-
lated.
Am I trying to promote violence and
capital punishment? No. In general, I op-
pose any unnecessary wars and fighting,
and I waver when it comes to execution
by the state. But I am not so morally in-
flexible that I can’t see that sometimes
war is a painful necessity, as it has been
throughout the Arab Spring. Change for
the good would have never occurred
otherwise. And whilst many might see
Gaddafi’s death as something that ought
to have been avoided, I can’t. His death
marked a clear-cut end to the war, and
now Libya can rise up with a clean slate
and begin anew. Our hopes will be with
them.
off the blame to the parents of these
people. Can you seriously be advocat-
ing that parents are the sole influence on
their children? There must come a point
when the child develops sufficient sen-
tient faculties to make the connection
between their parents’ mistakes and
their own situation. What we need here
is a society that, rather than encourag-
ing this spiral of poverty, inspires a
generation to better things. And I can
tell you that benefits definitely won’t
achieve this.
Anyhow, returning to the article.
Yes, it may have been a tad offensive.
I might even concede that there may be
some at Imperial who were affected by
the issues raised in the show. However,
the majority of normal people read the
article, formed an opinion on it, and got
on with their lives. So, to those out there
who were ‘fuming’and ‘apoplectic with
rage’, get over yourself and go and do
something worthwhile with your life.
