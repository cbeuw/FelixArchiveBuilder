T
his Tuesday, the UN is ex-
pected to name a child,
somewhere in the world, as
the planet’s seven billionth
living resident. The news
has been greeted with alacrity by much
of the same planet’s media, most notably
The Guardian, which ran articles such as
“Why current population growth is cost-
ing the Earth”. The idea that population
growth is spelling doom for us all is as
popular as it is old. It is just as wrong.
The obsession with population
found its most popular spokesperson
in the form of Rev. Thomas Robert
Malthus who, in the late 18th Century,
argued that if the poor of the world
kept reproducing at a high rate (the
poorest tend to have the highest birth
rates) then the only possible result in a
world of limited resources will be mass
starvation. It was in part due to such
ideas that the Irish famine was allowed
to run its terrible course. There is some
evidence to suggest that nature provides
mass population reduction as a way of
benefiting those left behind: incomes
rose significantly in Britain following the
devastation of the Black Death, which
left one person in three dead.
World population has skyrocketed
since the days of the Plague and Famine,
leading academics to postulate that the
next Big Disaster could well eclipse
all those that went before it. The 20th
Century anti
population
movement
reached
its zenith in
1968 with the
publication of
Paul Ehrlich’s ‘The
Population Bomb’. The
book brought home to non-
academic readers the potential
horrors of overpopulation with
the prediction that hundreds of
millions of people in developing
countries would perish to hunger
in the coming decades. Its front cover
proclaimed, “While you are reading
these words four people will have died
from hunger”.
Those decades have passed and
2.8 billion extra people now walk this
Earth, an increase greater than that
anticipated by Ehrlich. The result? In
the last 50 years, world population may
have doubled but agricultural production
tripled. Daily food supply per person
has increased by around 25%. But the
news is even more positive: population
growth is beginning to tail off. As people
get richer, despite being more able to
afford more children, they
in general choose to
have fewer. Better job
opportunities cause
people to focus more
on their careers
and lower rates
of child mortality
mean fewer
children need be
born in the first
place. The average
world birth rate
declined from 5.3 births
per woman in 1960 to
3.0 in 2006. It is true that these
are just averages and some regions
have gotten significantly worse.
But, these are countries such as
North Korea, Somalia and Zimbabwe
where it is clearly due to political
circumstances, not population. The
data paints a clear picture – increasing
global population is not leaving people
worse off and is anyway reaching
equilibrium, not exploding.
But while Ehrlich’s theory seems
disproved,
many modern
environmentalists
point to Malthusianism
in a new form –
global warming.
The increased
emission of CO2
that growing population
creates is endangering the very
people who, by being born, create it.
This was certainly the message of The
Guardian’s articles: more people =
more warming.
Nonsense.
More consumption = more warming,
regardless of the number of people.
I fail to see how a moral person can
worry about the existence of a child in
a large family in rural Africa who burns
a little wood for cooking while we
enjoy CO2
intensive Western lifestyles
7 Billion? That’s Numberwang!
Rory Fenton argues that population growth isn’t a priority
Jakov Marelic
over here.
Lifestyles
in the
developing
world are
increasing
CO2
output
in spite of
declining fertility.
Population just
is not the major issue
unless we have a
population boom in
the West.
This
is a
statistic
every
population worried
person should
be made aware of: doubling
the incomes of the world’s poorest
650 million people would take the
same resources as less than 1% of
the incomes of the world’s richest
650 million. Resources mean carbon.
Concerned about global warming?
Great, hand out condoms to bankers,
not Bangladeshis. It’s time to put the
population myth to rest.
Many people have argued that democ-
racy is actually one of the most radical
ideas in political history. To treat people
as equals with equal votes sits well with
most people today. We can also see the
effects of ideas like these in the West
in the last 300 years or so with mass
education, rising standards of living,
and the abolition of slavery, infanticide,
child labour, serfdom and feudalism.
There has also been greatly reduced
infant mortality, religious persecution,
racism, misogyny, superstition and war.
The few wars that do occur tend to be
tremendously more violent, but it is
also a long-term trend that they are get-
ting rarer.
Of course, the human race is not out
of the woods yet. Over-population, cli-
mate change, epidemics and nuclear
war are serious threats to civilisation
which may ‘do us in’ yet. Starvation
and disease still kill millions every year.
Now, all this is surely uncontrover-
sial and few people today would argue
democracy is a bad thing. But it is in-
teresting to see which groups oppose it
and what their motives are.
Libertarians, anarcho-capitalists and
others from the extreme political right
are some of the most powerful and
well-funded opponents.
This is unsurprising. These groups of-
ten argue that poor people are to blame
for their own poverty. So the values of
democracy which say all people, rich or
poor, are equal are abhorrent to them.
The socialist Tony Benn summarises
it as, “Before we had the vote, all the
power was in the hands of rich people,
if you had money you could get health-
care, education and look after yourself
when you were old. What democracy
did was to give the poor the vote and
it moved power from the marketplace
to the polling station, from the wallet to
the ballot.”
The danger democracy poses has
been expressed by the right-wing econ-
omist Milton Friedman when talking
about the relations between political
freedom of voting and economic free-
dom of the market. He writes: “while
economic freedom facilitates political
freedom, political freedom, once estab-
lished, has a tendency to destroy eco-
nomic freedom.”
Unsurprisingly, people tend to vote
for things that will benefit them i.e. not
unfettered markets.
It is interesting to see many of the in-
stitutions that conservatives favour are
usually dictatorial not democratic: the
army, the navy, the church, the business
firm and the patriarchal family.
Religious groups have also been
known to oppose democracy. In their
worldview, just as there are laws of
nature like gravity which are true
throughout the entire universe, there are
universal moral laws. These absolute
moral laws have been passed to us by
the supernatural creator of the universe.
Democracy is thus absurd because we
do not need to make laws by finding a
consensus of the people, we just need to
read holy scripture.
Abdur-Raheem Green, a fundamen-
talist Islamic preacher, is worth quot-
ing at length on this. “One of the major
problems [with democracy] was that
the leader would always have to pam-
per to the desires and whims of the peo-
ple in order to gain their support, thus
a leader would not be able to take the
morally sound decisions that a leader
should”. It is not hard to imagine what
kind of morally-sound decisions Abdur-
Raheem is thinking of.
A (thankfully anonymous) Catholic
author wrote on a recent Felixonline
comment about their church’s position
on various moral issues: “These things
aren’t like government policy, open for
debate and consultation to be brought
into line with popular public opinnion.
[sic] These are tennets that have been
handed down and safeguarded for over
two millenia [sic] and frankly that isn’t
going to change any time soon.”
Although having said this, many re-
ligious people support democracy and
in fact Christian socialists in the UK
were part of the popular front winning
these rights in the first place. We must
not forget that followers of religion are
people too; they also want a happy,
healthy, prosperous life and to be mas-
ters of their own destiny just like every-
one else.
Is Democracy the best policy?
“...the human race is
not out of the woods
yet”
