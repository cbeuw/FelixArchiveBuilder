COMMENT
I
n last week’s edition of Felix,
the comment piece ‘The Hell of
Heaven’ asked this question to
those who hope for an afterlife:
“Would you enjoy heaven?” In
this article, I’m aiming to clear up two
common misconceptions about what
Christians believe by offering a picture
of what the Bible actually says about
our eternal future. By the end of it, I
hope that you’ll have a good impression
of whether or not I think I’ll enjoy heav-
en, and why. NB: I’m not addressing the
question of whether there is life after
death, because that wasn’t the question
asked by last week’s article. However,
that could be the subject of some fruitful
debate in the future.
Many people brought up in the UK
will be at least vaguely familiar with
the Christian perspective on the after-
life. When asked what heaven is like,
many people talk of a soul leaving the
body and floating away like a balloon
to an ethereal, static and mind-numb-
ingly boring existence. By contrast,
the Bible’s picture of eternity is much
more real and concrete than the Platonic
view we’re often presented with. The
Bible asserts that God will bring about
what Christians call the New Creation:
a physical place that is similar to the old
universe, but better. Similarly, we won’t

There are more things in heaven...
spend all eternity as body-less entities;
in the New Creation we’re given new
bodies that are similar to the old ones,
but better:
The trumpet will sound, and the dead
will be raised imperishable, and we
shall be changed. For this perishable
body must put on the imperishable, and
this mortal body must put on immor-
tality. When the perishable puts on the
imperishable, and the mortal puts on
immortality, then shall come to pass the
saying that is written: “Death is swal-
lowed up in victory. O death, where is
your victory? O death, where is your
sting?”
(1 Corinthians 15:52-55, The Bible)
Secondly, we won’t spend our time
endlessly prostrating and grovelling.
In this life we go about our work, build
friendships, have adventures and ex-
periments. These good things continue
in the New Creation, except that all the
drudgery and frustration of work will be
banished. The phrase “all good things
come to an end” is turned on its head:
no good thing comes to an end. Think of
the very best that this world has to offer;
that which makes life worth living. I’m

L
ast week, it was an-
nounced that UCL is going
to change their grade sys-
tem towards the American
model. They are abandon-
ing the first, 2:1 etc. leading Imperial
students to ask: is this also going to
happen to us? The Union immediately
said: We won’t allow that to happen
because then this will become a (more)
competitive university. Wow, what an
argument. I mean, seriously, we aren’t
in Kindergarten here, we are at a uni-
versity with a widely known and ap-
preciated reputation. We are at the fore-
front of research and all the companies
in the world are standing in line to get
a hold of our graduates. You think this
isn’t competitive? Ask yourself: why
am I studying here? It is not (entirely)
because you love engineering, science,
or medicine. It is because you want to
be the best and therefore you study at
a university which can give you a de-
gree that states that you are the best.
One that shows that you went through
4 years (or in medicine even more) of
hell, of sweat and tears, of the problem
sheets and course works, only to get a
degree on which it says “Imperial Col-
lege London”. That is why you study
here.
Don’t tell me that employers will be
confused and won’t appreciate your
degree. Because a) you still come
from Imperial College and that doesn’t
change a bit, and b) in the new system,
employers can more easily determine
your worth. Let me put it like this, how
do employers differentiate between
a “good” and a “bad” first? A first is
the highest degree you can get here. It
states that you are one of the best in
your subject. But if over 60% of gradu-
ates get a grade that high (or almost
that high), how can you tell who re-
ally is the best? These are things that
employers want to know. I think that
if you ask Shell, McKinsey, or BCG
what they think of the idea of making
the university more competitive, whilst
introducing a grade systems that allows
them to differentiate between students,
they would be all for it. Don’t insult the
intelligence of these companies by say-
ing they wouldn’t understand another
grade system (which, by the way, is
already used in the US, a country not
unimportant in the job market).
Be honest, you don’t want the grade
system changed because you think
it will mean that your grades will go
down. You think that you are too medi-
ocre to stand out from the crowd in the
new system. If you admit that there is
a discrepancy between the grades that
you get and your actual “quality”, then
yes, you can complain about this being
fixed, but you can’t seriously blame
the university for fixing it. The only
person that is to blame is you, because
you don’t study hard enough to merit a
“real” first.
So please, let’s face reality: there
is no real point in arguing for the old
system, because we are already a very
competitive university and companies
will appreciate this move. It introduces
better differentiation and more hones-
ty, and if we are objective and rational,
that’s what all of us want. The new sys-
tem won’t be perfect, but the fact that it
will improve matters should be a good
enough reason for introducing it.
a good mate. If there is a God, all these
things were his idea! So if God has gone
to the trouble of giving us such good
things to enjoy, why would he then take
them away when we get to heaven?
I could never express it as well as C.S.
Lewis, so I’ll finish this article by quot-
ing the final paragraphs of the last book
in The Chronicles of Narnia.
“There was a real railway acci-
dent,” said Aslan softly. “Your father
and mother and all of you are – as you
called it in the Shadowlands – dead. The
term is over: the holidays have begun.
The dream is ended: this is the morn-
ing.”
And as he spoke he no longer looked
to them like a lion; but the things that
began to happen after that were so
great and beautiful that I cannot write
them. And for us this is the end of all
the stories, and we can most truly say
that they all lived happily ever after. But
for them it was only the beginning of
the real story. All their life in this world
and all their adventures in Narnia had
only been the cover and the title page;
now at last they were beginning Chapter
One of the great story which no one on
earth has read, which goes on forever,
in which every chapter is better than the
one before.
Just to let you in on a secret, the views expressed here are the
opinions of the authors, not Felix
In response to the comments
made by Michael Foster last
week, on the new responsible
retailing of alcohol policies
and how they have affected
the way in which bar nights are
run, I would like to clear a few
things up.
Yes, the RSMU did run a bar
night during Freshers’ week,
though to say that this event
was so successful and highly
attended that it made us want
to hold another is mislead-
ing, and only forms half of the
story. The RSMU Halloween
Bar Night (27.10.11) is an an-
nual event, and was planned
before the start of term. The
high involvement that we have
seen this year is a culmination
of several efforts, and cannot
solely be attributed to one of
our Freshers’ events.
The new system introduces a
shift in the way that clubs use
bar nights since they do not al-
low clubs, and their students,
to reap the previous benefits
of cheap drinks alongside prof-
itability. Having run a capacity
event under the new system,
I can tell you that, even with
the highest ticket prices ever
charged for this particular
event, subsidies were still re-
quired in order to break even.
To say that our event was a
success is true, since it pro-
vided a great night out for
those attending, but to say
that this is a result of the new
system is false. There is no
way for clubs to take any profit
from a bar night without charg-
ing more that the standard
price for drinks, and in total
the takings from the event did
not match its expenditure.
The sad fact is that these reg-
ulations also seem to be set in
stone from here on out. Having
spoken to Michael (DPFS) and
Monya (DPCS) on several oc-
casions about this issue, we
eventually saw the financial
basis behind these decisions.
In short, the previous system
cannot be maintained into the
coming year without the Union
taking on a loss, which it can-
not sustain. Changes had to
be made.
RIP bar nights; you will be
sorely missed.
