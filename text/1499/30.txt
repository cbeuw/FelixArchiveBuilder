2012 Spring/Summer highlight
Winter may have just begun, but the Fashion World already cannot wait for sunnier days
sic. The clothes were delicate;
soft sugary colours featuring
elaborately laser cut pieces,
sheer organza layers and
smooth sweaters. Dropped
waists gave a new, relaxed
shape as oversized buttons
elaborated the ladylike feel of
the jackets and coats. Textures
were central once again, but
this time it was floating ostrich
feathers and crystal encrusted
daisies that clung to the prin-
cesses’ dresses, a complete
turn around from the dark fe-
tish leathers of last season.
As always with Marc, detail
was key. The girls balanced
Paris is no stranger to glittering
displays of luxury, but no one
expected the angelic dream
that Marc Jacobs showcased
at Louis Vuitton this season.
Amidst the rumours of ‘Will
He/Won’t He?’ regarding the
Dior job, the curtains rose on
the LV catwalk to reveal mod-
els sprinkled elegantly over an
exquisite, pure white carousel.
The dreamy innocence of the
show was accentuated with
fairy lights, sparkling mirrors
and tinkling jewellery box mu-
shining tiaras in their loosely
chignoned hair; candy coloured
shoes were pointy with spar-
kling silver straps; and bags
came as a choice between
sweet elegant snake skins or
weaved metallic baskets, whilst
diamond wishbone pendants
hung daintily under large icing
white collars.
Fluttering by in a puffed pale
pearl dress, Kate Moss’ turn
on the catwalk was the perfect
end to this season’s Louis Vuit-
ton wonderland, and arguably
the fairy tale ending to what
may be Marc Jacobs’ last chap-
ter there. – AY

draping techniques of the tra-
ditional haute couture. The co-
lour palette came straight from
the pearly inside of an oyster:
palest pinks and silvery grey-
blue were shot between ivory,
gold and brightest coral.
But it wouldn’t be McQueen
without the shadow of a sinis-
ter presence: laser-cut black
patent leather quite literally set
a shark amongst the fishes, or
more likely, the jellyfish, such
was the lightness of the ruffles
cut in undulating, fluttering lay-
ers down skirts both long and
short. A thoroughly feminine
line, though with distinct ele-
Surely those most critical of
critics in the fashion industry
must get tired of singing the
praises of a woman who has
slipped so perfectly into the
8-inch sculpted platforms of
a designer whose shoes they
claimed could ne’er be filled.
Alas, no dice. Sarah Burton’s
latest aquatic imagining for Mc-
Queen’s line interweaved such
diverse themes as oceanic life,
modernist architecture and the
ments of darkness, no look
was complete without a lace,
veil-like headpiece by Philip
Treacy, creator of similar piec-
es for the hugely acclaimed
McQueen retrospective, Sav-
age Beauty. The sculpted, ar-
chitectural figure, complete
with defined waist, exagger-
ated hips and shoulders typi-
cal of the line was executed to
distinction.
The ever-haunting echo of
Lee McQueen, a presence both
restrictive and guiding, cer-
tainly reverberated and rippled
through Ms. Burton’s idyllic
seascape. – SV

Showing ahead of the Baz
Luhrmann remake starring
Leonardo DiCaprio and Carey
Mulligan, Ralph has created a
wardrobe that is more than fit
enough for the new Miss Bu-
chanan.
For the day, a floral print
bias-cut dress paired with
a straw picnic basket, silk
cloche and raffia espadrilles.
Or perhaps an androgynous
three-piece chauffeur suit,
either with relaxed, flat-front
trousers or boyish shorts.
And for the evening, Daisy’s
choices are endless: from a
drop-waist silk shift in bright
An unexpected highlight of
the New York shows this sea-
son came from Ralph Lauren,
whose Great Gatsby-themed
sugary-sweet collection stole
the heart of more than one
hardened fashionista.
With the most delicious pal-
ette of Ladurée pastels, the
reprise of the roaring twenties
would not be complete without
cloche hats, drop-waist flap-
per dresses, and, of course,
lashings of feathers and fring-
ing.
swan white, pistachio green or
shell pink to a glittering silver
evening gown with her choice
of cascading ostrich feathers
down the skirt, or sparkling
beaded fringing – or perhaps
both, should the mood strike
her.
Accessories were kept sim-
ple, a diamond drop earring
here, a long single strand
pearl necklace there, and a
feather boa for the Charles-
ton.
It seems superfluous to say
that the Great Gatsby has nev-
er looked so, well err, great.
