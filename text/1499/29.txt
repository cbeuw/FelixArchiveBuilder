“Change begins with a whisper”
Here is this year’s answer to The Blind
Side. A feel-good movie that looks at
controversial issues involving white
guilt and somehow ends up being the
year’s most watchable, straightforward
films. The only difference is that if any
of the cast for The Help do score some
awards for their performances, simi-
lar to what Sandra Bullock managed
to swing in 2010, the women of “The
Help” would actually deserve the shiny
statuettes.
The complex issue The Help deals
with is racism, and the idea of hired
help in 1960s America – or more spe-
cifically, the use and treatment of black
maids with the shockingly popular
term “separate but equal” being used
to segregate black Americans. The
help, required to cook, clean, shop and
raise children for their white, superior
bosses, do so to make ends meet. Con-
descending tone, demeaning gestures
and verbal abuse are commonplace, but
to earn 95 cents per hour, these women
work morning, noon and night, in a
society that refuses to fully embrace
them.
Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis) has
raised and parted with more than a
dozen children. Having lost her own
child not too long ago, she finds it ever
more painful, and the discrimination
she faces from a household she dedi-
cates herself to (she even has a separate
toilet because the owners fear they will
catch some unknown disease) is uncon-
scionable in our eyes, but she accepts it
since she has faced this kind of behav-
iour every day. Minny Jackson (Octavia
Spencer) is a maid whose frank words
and bold attitude have garnered her a
reputation for being difficult. Minny’s
boss, the evil Hilly Holbrook (Bryce
Dallas Howard), is a nasty piece of
work who poisons her suburban neigh-
bourhood with her snobbish, arrogant
words. Seeing the maids’ everyday
struggle and deciding to do something
about this is Eugina “Skeeter” Phelan
(Emma Stone), a brave young graduate
who wishes to write a book chronicling
the daily hardship faced by the hired
help. A lot of people around her seem to
be ignoring the racial inequality she so
clearly sees, including her own mother,
Charlotte (Allison Janney).
Are white people evil for employ-
ing black maids? The film is correct
in showing us that not everything can
be summed up that simply. Sure the
character of Hilly Holbrook, the film’s
main antagonist, is drawn with a hint of
comical caricature, but the rest of the
cast represents something more com-
plicated, and the white employers are
far from hateful.
There is a cloud of mystery created
as Skeeter discovers her beloved child-
hood maid, Constantine (the invalu-
able Cicely Tyson), has simply disap-
peared. Her mother refuses to give her
a straight answer. When we finally do
see what really happened, it turns into
one of the most heart-breaking scenes
in the film, with unforgettable perfor-
mances from Janney, Stone and Tyson,
especially.
Davis, who in supporting roles has
been consistently excellent no matter
what genre, gives an even more stirring
performance as she is given a bigger
part. She is always so full of love and
is more than committed – she is good at
her job, too, as she takes care of those
around her with much warmth and
compassion. Minny is someone who
will generate more laughs, with Spen-
cer delivering that right mix of tough,
no-nonsense woman whilst showing
empathy to those she deems deserving.
Minny ends up with a new boss,
and it turns out that Celia Foote (Jes-
sica Chastain) is the polar opposite of
Hilly. Celia is a cheerful but clueless
and insecure housewife who is desper-
ate to please her well-off husband. She
and Minny bond, and as that unlikely
friendship develops, the audience also
learns that white people have difficul-
ties of their own, and seeing Spencer
lower her defense to someone she
never thought would be her “equal” is
a change grasped well by the otherwise
straight-talking, hilarious Spencer. And
Chastain, who is having one heck of a
year with a long line of impressive per-
formances stacking up to her glowing
resume, can count this one in too.
Sure, it is undeniably too neat; but
this is a feel-good movie, which is why
everything is so tidy and the director
(Tate Taylor) refuses to get his hands
dirty. The script is somewhat restricted
in its portrayal of a wider communi-
ty, and rushes into tying up the loose
ends with a convenient, feel-good set
of answers. But the important thing is
we care about the characters – black
or white, discrimination is wrong, and
many heart-felt, uplifting scenes show
us this and its message could not be
clearer.

The Help
ed by dead children, but you’re not
exactly going to be pissing your pants.
Turns out to be more of a sad, yet heart-
warming story than scary. Maybe don’t
go for any midnight visits to abandoned
orphanages, though.
Ghost
The only part of this film that’ll give
you nightmares is Patrick Swayze’s
acting, or the equally horrifying fact
that his character only ever replies to
“I love you” with “Ditto”. However,
Whoopi Goldberg certainly manages
to make up for it with her sassy one-
liners and outrageous 80s get up. Yes,
the whole ghost thing is a very tenuous
link to Halloween but who says you
can’t celebrate with a soppy 80s chick
flick?
5 Films to watch on Halloween (if you’re a MASSIVE WUSS...)
Coraline
Admittedly a little sinister considering
it’s meant for kids, this is the perfect
film for a wussy Halloween. The film
about venturing off into secret worlds
is magical, mysterious and beautifully
made, and there’s a stunning scene
where the garden literally comes alive
with glowing flowers (although look out
for the plants that look suspiciously like
femidoms). One of those few films that
actually makes sense for it to be in 3D.
The Orphanage (El Orfa-
nato)
This English-subtitled Spanish film has
a few scary faces and involves the tradi-
tionally creepy premise of being haunt-
much every single British comedian that
exists (there are cameos from Rob Bry-
don, Tasmin Greig and David Walliams
along with many others) and it’s only a
teeny bit gory, so avoid eating anything
that looks like someone’s innards whilst
you watch it and you should be alright.
Young Frankenstein
The fact that Gene Wilder is the star of
the film should surely give it some scare
factor. This parody remake of Mary
Shelley’s novel makes plenty of nods
to classic black and white horror films,
complete with old-school scene transi-
tions. Apparently, Aerosmith got the
idea for the title of their song ‘Walk this
way’ from a gag at the beginning of the
film, so if that’s not got you watching it
I don’t know what will.
So, it’s Halloween and your friends sug-
gest you have a group trip to the cin-
ema to watch Paranormal Activity 3.
There’s just one problem: last time you
watched a scary film, it was The Ring
when it came out on DVD ten years ago,
and despite watching it in the middle of
the day you still shat yourself. Have no
fear! Here’s a list of ‘safe films’ for ut-
ter wimps like you.
Shaun of the Dead
If you haven’t seen this film yet, where
have you been? Quite possibly one of
the most successful British films in re-
cent years, this zombie-smashing film
will have you laughing like nobody’s
business. The cast comprises pretty
