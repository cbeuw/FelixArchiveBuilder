IC Fencing Women’s 1st maintain
their position as number 1.
Early on Saturday morning, Imperi-
al Fencing’s Women’s first team start-
ed their journey to Cambridge. With
a great season behind (BUCS Cham-
pions with only victories in the score
sheet), confidence, expectations and
eager to perform were very high. Not
even a traffic jam due to closed mo-
torway being partly closed resulting in
2h delay would bring them down!
The schedule was done so that the
first third of each match, foil, would
be fenced on Saturday, followed by
sabre and epee, the other two weap-
ons, on Sunday. This meant that Zoe
Robinson, Alice Mitchell and Hannah
Bryars were to start it all off. First
match is Cambridge, and despite the
girls not having had any time for a
proper warm up, they dance through
it with the final score 45-5. Positively
puzzled, they continue by winning
against Queen Mary 45-11 and the
new comers UCL 45-14. Last match
was Oxford, a team that turned out to
be a greater challenge than expected.
It’s an even match at the start, the lead
swaying back and forth, but towards
the end Oxford pulls themselves to-
gether and wins 45-33, the first foil
match Imperial has lost in a year’s
time.
Sunday arrives, with sabre on piste
first. Zoe and Hannah continue and
Alice is swapped for Clare Harding.
Clare has had to wake up hourly dur-
ing the night for medical reasons,
but with the combination of caffeine
and adrenaline nothing can stop her.
The three girls show no respect to
the other teams and crush Cambridge
with 45-27, UCL 45-24, Oxford with

Resoundingwins forwomen’s fencing
After the abysmal performance in the
preseason friendly against UCL, the
Men’s 2s regrouped and approached
their first competitive match of the sea-
son in a whole new light.
Roehampton University’s Men’s 1s
provided the opposition who joined
this league from the one above after be-
ing relegated last season. Arguably this
made them the team to beat if we were
to push for promotion. The short trip
from South Kensington to Roehamp-
ton’s home pitch at the Bank of England
Sports Ground would have been smooth
sailing, if it were not for Yellow Bag’s
inability to follow basic directions
around Hammersmith Roundabout .
Armed with a new defensive strategy
and formation and two new additions
to the side -Fresher Oli and a guest ap-
pearance by Teabag of the Men’s 3rd
Team - we started the game briskly.
Some weaving runs on the right by
Dirty Whaler culminated in a extreme-
ly arrogant aerial ball down the line to
Fresher Danny who shimmied past the
Roehampton left-back and proceeded to
hit the ball across the circle to Strap-on
who was waiting to tap it into the open
goal.
1-0 up and looking solid at the back,
our new defensive press allowed us to
get all our players behind the ball and
force Roehampton’s heads down. After
a while they started dribbling up their
own arses and we were able to break
their attacks down one by one before
they even made it to our shooting circle.
