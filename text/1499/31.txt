ts hot from the catwalks
s. Saskia Verhagen and Alice Yang bring you the best from September’s catwalks
case of motoring. 1950s cars
featured in cartoon form on
leather skirts and clutch bags,
as well as tantalizing prints.
Defined colour combinations
added a sense of power and
strength to otherwise innocent
looking pastel pleats, with
hemlines strictly down to the
knee. There was an all-togeth-
er Marilyn Monroe feel to the
show as models strutted over
a subway grate, yet there was
also Grease-like sense of fun,
with plenty of leathers and tiny
bandeau tops.
Sparkling jewels studded
shimmering satin coats and
There’s no doubt that Miuccia
Prada knows how to please
women with her easy to wear
and elegantly chic designs, but
this season she took it upon
herself to please the male pop-
ulation too. ‘How so?’ I hear you
ask, not with an extensive show
of scantily clad models (al-
though there were bare midriffs
a-plenty), but rather by combin-
ing two of the things men love
best – women and cars.
Spring/Summer 2012 at
Prada was an artistic show-
Prada made up the majority of acces-
sories in the form of necklac-
es, large earrings and delicate
belts. Thin felt jackets featured
sharp lapels, contrasting the
relaxed, rounded shoulders
and appliqué flowers in bright
colours scattered over the
front.
Flames too were a Prada fa-
vourite this season, rising up
from pale chiffon dresses as
fire protruded from the back
of wedges, and stilettos were
topped with burning exhausts.
Undoubtedly, this summer’s
Prada girls will have a strong
sense of Va Va Voom. – AY

DSquared2
floated down the catwalks on
long flowing dresses, yellows
and greens clashed on shorts
as blooming courgettes, glow-
ing orange tomatoes were
scattered over suit jackets,
and siren red chillies added
a second layer of hot to tiny
bra tops. Dolce & Gabbana
let nothing escape their Taste
of Italia this season as far-
falle bows dangled from ears,
peppers hung from wrists
and even their sweet wicker
baskets featured onion pen-
dants.
Eveningwear took a darker
turn, yet frivolous femininity
The scorching days of a tra-
ditional Italian summer were
the roots of Dolce and Gabba-
na’s catwalk inspiration this
season. It was a show filled
to the brim with flirtatious,
fun, light-hearted pieces with
a dash of glamour stirred into
one giant salad – definitely
the recipe to follow next
whenever the sun comes out
again.
Painted aubergine prints
continued as a main theme.
Appliquéd flowers covered
delicate black crochet as em-
bellishments scattered over
dark sleek dresses. Rain-
bow gems lined collars and
waists, scattered over trans-
parent rain macs and shone
over lace before finally taking
over the entire runway. Dolce
& Gabbana’s finale this sea-
son was a sea of beautiful
models in sparkling corsets
strutting under the arches of
glowing festival street lights.
Mambo Italiano is definitely
the way to go this summer.

Dolce &
Gabbana
ies were replaced by studs,
ripped denim, bright parkas,
sequins, plaid, flannel, fur,
feathers and fedoras, all
piled on in glorious festival
form. And, of course, the not
unsubtle repeating motif of
the American flag, manifest-
ed separately as top, skirt
and scarf.
The girls accessorised in
the standard festival manner,
with wristbands piled high,
VIP passes swinging free,
foot-long fringed bags on their
arm and, naturally, a brew in
hand.
Though by no means a fash-
‘An American girl goes to
Glastonbury,’ was the vi-
sion, according to Dean and
Dan, the dynamic duo be-
hind the oh-so Italian brand,
DSquared2
. And an ultra-fab-
ulous girl she is too, stomp-
ing her high-heeled wellington
boots (only the Italians…)
down the muddy Milanese
runway.
Their American girl had a
distinctly cooler edge than
the British girl at Glasto –
ditsy florals and lazy track-
ion revelation, the DSquared2
boys’ show was high in broad
appeal and wearability, and
was styled to absolute per-
fection.
Production-wise, aside from
the thumping soundtrack
(heavy on the Lenny Kravitz
please), it would be an in-
justice and a crime not to
mention the mud-caked male
models frolicking by the back-
drop. If only one could find a
real festival that exhibited
such fine models of male
anatomy, oh, and of course,
such cool, sexy, rock-chic
style. – SV
