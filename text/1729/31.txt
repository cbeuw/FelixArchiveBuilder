you should really get on board
take a few lessons from.
With their town slogan
of ‘Where everyone fits
in’, the locals of Schitt’s
Creek really care about
upholding this promise.
Upon the arrival of the
Roses, they are pretty
much embraced by the
people of Schitt’s Creek in
their time of need – some-
thing the Roses are most
definitely not used to.
More importantly, the
showisextremelygraceful
in its portrayal of LGBT+
relationships. Dan Levy
is sensitive to display any
LGBT+ relationships as,
well, relationships that are
no different from those
between straight couples.
The show also makes a
point to ensure that the
characters never need to
justify their sexualities,
and no habitant of Schitt’s
Creek shows any sign
of homophobia, or even
any unusual interest in
the lives of the LGBT+
members of their society.
Character develop-
ment
I honestly believe that
this show has some of the
best character develop-
ment arc ever on TV. Over
time, these characters,
some of whom start out
as the most egotistical,
unbearable characters im-
aginable, become people
you genuinely care about.
Not only do they start
feeling like real people
(a hard feat, given how
easy it would have been
to turn the characters into
shadows of what they are,
and simply caricatures),
but as they learn how to be
a family, they start feeling
like a part of your family.
So much goddamn
heart
Although a simple
premise, the show packs a
punch with its heart, more
so in the later seasons. The
first season relies more
on comedy to establish
the characters properly.
However, starting in
season two, everything
changes. The changes are
always perfectly paced
and perfectly placed,
coming across as natural
and justified. Despite
still being immensely
funny, the characters
grow in front of your
eyes, saying and doing
things you would have
never expected them to
in previous seasons. And
it is when these heartfelt
moments happen that you
can’t help but fall in love
with the show.
In fact, a specific
episode in season four
contains one of the most
underrated, heartfelt,
incredible scene that is so
grand in some ways, but
with so many intricate,
subtle moments acted
brilliantly by the entire
cast. And by no means is
this a one-off occurrence.
In fact, as the characters
develop and the storylines
ripen over time, these
What’s next in store?
It has been con-
firmed recently that the
upcoming sixth season
of Schitt’s Creek will be
its last, despite growing
exponentially in popular-
ity recently. The creators
want to end the show on
their terms, in the right
way. Although it breaks
my heart that I will no
longer get to spend time
with the Rose family, I
trust the Levy family to
conclude this show as
gloriously as possible.
Season six has been
confirmed to premiere
in January 2020 and will
conclude in the spring,
and should be available
on the UK Netflix shortly
after it ends, if the pattern
they followed with season
five is any indication.
All five seasons are
currently available on the
UK Netflix, which I hope
you are going on right
now to save it to your list,
watch the first episode,
and who knows, maybe
end up falling in love with
it much like I have.

Dan Levy is transpar-
ent and honest about the
cause of Schitt’s Creek’s
growing popularity. He
attributes it to the availa-
bility of the show’s back
catalogue on Netflix,
which has allowed even
more people to discover
the show all over the
world, compared to when
it simply aired on a small
Canadian channel and a
small US-based channel.
