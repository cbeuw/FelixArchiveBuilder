Glass. Kill. Bluebeard. Imp.
A
s the title
implies, this
performance
was comprised
of four different plays,
each increasing in length
– the final play, ‘Imp’, was
one hour long. ‘Glass’tells
the story of a girl made
of glass, discussing im-
portant themes of abuse.
However, this aspect
didn’t seem to quite fit in
as I felt that it would have
been equally as impactful
if the short sketch was
performed without the girl
being made of glass. ‘Kill’
was a bizarre monologue
by ‘God’ talking about
the violence and absurd-
ity of the Greeks who
invented all these Gods
who don’t actually exist.
‘Bluebeard’s Friends’
centres around a series
of conversations between
four people whose friend
has just been found to
have been a serial killer
who murdered all six of
his wives, as they try to
wrap their heads around
it. Lastly, ‘Imp’ is the tale
of an elderly pair who live
together and get visits
from a homeless man and
an Irish girl, who even-
tually form a romantic
relationship.
There is not a single
bad performance from
any actor in any of the
four plays. The talent on
the stage was remarkable,
particularly the rapport
between Deborah Findlay
and Toby Jones in both
‘Bluebeard’s Friends’
and especially in ‘Imp’.
Miriam Buether’s set
designs were wondrous,
particularly that of the
second play, where the
stage consisted of a
floating cloud with ‘God’
sitting atop it, and also
the third play, in which
bloodied wedding dresses
hung in the background
throughout the whole
sketch. But for me, none
of this takes away from
the fact that I found the
plays to be just a bit point-
less – it felt like nothing
happened in the entire 2
hours of performance,
and whilst captivating to
watch the performances,
it was too long a period of
time for nothing to have
occurred. Simply put, it
didn’t feel very satisfying.
I walked out of the
theatre feeling very
confused as I heard every-
body nattering around me
about how profound and
wonderful the show was.
Then a few days later a
whole slew of five-star
reviews came out and I
found myself even more
confused. It is not often
I give such an average
rating for a play; usually
I find something to rave
about, whether it’s the
acting, the set design, the
writing, or meaning, but
there is an overwhelming
sense throughout this
whole play that it is defi-
nitely aimed exclusively
at the bourgeoisie of
London. Ultimately, there
was no action, there was
no obvious meaning or
relevance. I know Caryl
Churchill is an extremely
well-regarded playwright,
but perhaps this type of
play just suits certain types
of people; evidently much
of the audience enjoyed it
so I’d still give it a go and
see if you engage with the
commentary. Or perhaps
the meaning was hidden
deep within the subtext,
but I just personally
feel that for a play to be
meaningful it needs to be
accessible to the average
person on some level.
Whilst the set was great
and there were some
fantastic performances, I
don’t think it did enough
to outweigh the lack of
substance nor did it justify
the price.
ONE: Rough Edged Insights to the State We’re In
R
econciliation,
compromise &
understanding.
These are words
one would be hard pushed
to find mentioned in
modern British political
discourse. So evident
is their absence that the
more hopeless among us
may feel they have been
forever barred from the
British psyche. Here in
One, a show where thea-
tre meets clowning meets
performance art, the sense
of windows being opened
to let fresh air and ideas in
the room is overwhelm-
ing. The most promising
scent of course being its
exploration of this para-
graph’s opening words. To
focus solely on this single
thematic exploration
would be to do a disser-
vice to the multifaceted
greatness on display here.
ONE is funny, macabre
and emotionally distress-
ing at points. The control
Bert and Nasi manage to
exert over you with their
powerful performances is
disturbing but a testament
to their skills as clowns,
actors and artists.
We start surreal
(don’t worry it only
gets stranger), Nasi up a
ladder, Bert asking him to
come down. Nasi likes the
space, the freedom. Bert
seems keen on closeness.
His love bordering on
suffocating and selfish.
The fourth wall is never
allowed to be built as
Bert brings the crowd in
to the show from the off.
Nerveless in his respons-
es, the witty back and
forths would make one
think there were plants
in the audience were the
exchanges not so natural.
The stage is simple,
consisting of a chair, the
aforementioned ladder, a
table and a laptop. Bert
and Nasi are casually
dressed – looking like they
jumped out the audience
on to the stage. This all
creates a sense of comfort
which allows the emotion-
al range on display feel
more authentic – these are
‘just some guys’ and we
see ourselves reflected in
how they feel. It’s acting
but doesn’t feel like it. Id-
iosyncrasies abound, Bert
in particular providing a
comic touch that is woven
throughout. This humour
helps to counter some
of the more dramatic
emotions on display
whilst also meaning you
feel emotionally dragged
and don’t know what to
feel when.
Nasi will eventually
join Bert on the floor,
but this only makes room
for further wonderfully
strange scenes – a high-
light being Bert’s creepy-
yet-funny monologue
on stalking the audience
home. In one moment
Nasi comments on the
state of theatre and those
who are perhaps trying
too hard to make some-
thing ‘new’. The brilliant
irony of course is that they
themselves have really
made something that
feels different to anything
we’ve seen. Each scene
is an invitation to think
about how we relate to our
loved ones and those who
differ. The messaging is
subtle whilst provoking.
In this show we choose
the ending, tonight a
happy one. This injection
of the ‘democratic will’
is a fitting ending and
one can only hope such
a happy fate will follow
for the country. ONE is
essential viewing that
leaves you exhausted
with the emotional roll-
ercoaster undertaken. Do
not miss it.
