Arts Editor Intro: Claire - the culture vulture
T
his is my second
year as Arts sec-
tion editor. It’s
a role that never
gets boring – London
really is one of the best
cities in the world for
culture. It’s a wonderful
mix of things old and new.
Van Gogh and Warhol.
Russian classical ballet
and Merce Cunningham’s
contemporary choreog-
raphy. Shakespeare and
Ibsen, cheek by jowl with
new playwrights writing
about issues for our times.
I joined Felix Arts
back in third year, on the
persuasion of the Arts
editor at the time. The
main draw was the press
tickets really.At first I was
nervous about reviewing.
What if my writing wasn’t
good enough? Was I
entitled to have an opinion
on things which I definite-
ly wasn’t an expert on? If
an award-winning artist
had made something that
I really hated, was I just
incapable of appreciating
its genius?
It took me some time,
but I eventually got over
those fears. Anyone can
write (admittedly to
varying degrees of quality,
but that’s what editors are
for). I also realised two
important things: first,
you don’t need to be an
expert to recognise good
or bad art, and second,
even award-winning
artists produce squibs.
I started to get excited
about seeing my articles
in print – it was the best
feeling when people told
me that they’d gone to
see a show on the basis of
my review. Or the reverse,
for that matter. Writing a
stinging review is actually
more fun than writing a
good one.
What sort of art do I
appreciate the most? It’s
a difficult choice, but I’d
have to say the opera. The
sheer melodrama! Jilted
lovers, seething passions,
murder and intrigue!
The soaring voices and
sublime music! You leave
the grandeur and plush
confines of the Royal
Opera House feeling, for
Manon
M
anon, based
on the
1731 novel
L’histoire du
chevalier des Grieux et de
Manon Lescaut by Abbé
Prévost, was reimagined
by Kenneth Macmillan
in 1974 as a ballet and
remains a captivating
story to this day. It tells
the tale of Manon who,
though in love with Des
Grieux, agrees to be mis-
tress to Monsieur G.M. as
he offers her wealth and
luxury. Over three acts,
the ballet recounts this
story between Manon and
Des Grieux which ends in
tragedy. I tried not to read
too much about the story
before I went in, to see
how much I could pick up
from just the dancing – it
was amazing how expres-
sive the dancers were and
how the story and charac-
ters can come across just
from the movements, no
words or acting needed.
Particularly amusing was
Ryoichi Hirano, playing
Manon’s brother, in his
drunken party scene,
simultaneously graceful
and deliberately clumsy.
Sarah Lamb does an
exquisite job of playing
Manon, switching be-
tween a greedy, amoral
woman, willing to sacri-
fice happiness for a life
of opulence, and an inno-
cent, romantic lover to the
poor student Des Grieux,
masterfully portrayed by
Vadim Muntagirov. The
chemistry between the
two of them is evident,
and all their scenes to-
gether with the lifts, tum-
bles, and entanglements
were mesmerising. The
bedroom pas de deux in
particular was painfully
beautiful to watch.
The whole performance
was a masterpiece to me.
Ensemble scenes with the
whole Royal Ballet com-
pany coupled with beau-
tiful, intricate set designs
by Nicholas Georgiadis,
were a feast for the eyes,
painting vivid pictures.
The contrast between the
large scenes with their
hustling and bustling and
stripped-back intimate
love scenes was important
in intensifying the emo-
tions in the pas de deux
scenes between Manon
and Des Grieux.
Ballet is often seen as
rather high-brow, but this
evening showed me that
anyone can appreciate the
beauty and flair exuded
by the dancers. Ultimate-
ly it is an art, and even as
someone who knows noth-
ing about dance, I could
clearly see the dedication
and sheer talent that goes
into a performance like
this. I was completely in
awe. Unfortunately, I’ve
had to knock off half a star
because whilst I do think
that you don’t have to be
‘posh’ to enjoy the ballet
as an art form, on the eco-
nomical front it remains
an unnecessary expense
for the average student,
especially if you want a
decent seat with a view of
the whole stage. However,
this show is a real treat so
if you fancy splurging on
a nice evening out, I can
safely recommend this!

a moment, like you’d
stepped into a different
world.
That’s what I love
about the arts and why I
think more people should
appreciate them. A bril-
liant play, an awe-inspir-
ing artwork or a beautiful
dance can take your breath
away. It makes you stop
for a moment. It makes
you imagine things you
may never have dreamed
of, or feel emotions that
you may never experience
otherwise.
