Layden is the Latest Executive to Leave Sony
“He was
the main
supervisor on
projects such
as Little Big
Planet”
ite of mine). His recent
years have been very
successful in not only
maintaining the success
of Sony but also in paving
the way for Sony’s future
success.
Layden’s leaving may
leave some in dismay,
with the PS5 around the
corner and no word yet
of anyone picking up the
position… but this is not
uncommon within Sony
and PlayStation in recent
years.
Dearly Departed
Layden is only the latest
to join a growing list of
high-profile PlayStation
executives to suddenly
leave the company. The
first of the recent bunch
to leave was in 2014 the
aforementioned Jack
Tretton, ex-head of Play-
Station. In 2016, Adam
Boyes, the man in charge
of relations with 3rd party
companies left to “return
to the world of game de-
velopment” – according
to his Twitter. You might
remember Boyes from the
E3 2013 meme-worthy
PlayStation Used Game
Instructional Video, in
which he simply received
a game and said “thanks”.
2017 saw the exit of
Hirai in March. Kaz Hirai
had a 35-year long career
with Sony, ending as the
chairman of the entire
corporation.
So many major players
in Sony and PlayStation
have been leaving. Two
30+ year careers ending
in the last 7 months is
more than just a coinci-
dence… right? It seems
that on all occasions the
exits have been positive.
Whether people have
left for personal reasons,
retirement or to pursue
a different career, there
has been no ill will nor
has there been any cases
of ‘jumping ship’. There
have been no official
statements into the matter,
so one can only postulate.
But when Hirai left
in March this year, he
said “I am confident that
everyone is fully aligned
under [New Successor’s]
strong influence” and that
they are “ready to build
an even brighter future
for Sony”. So, it seems
that the mass exodus of
senior members of Sony
is more of a passing of the
torch than anything else,
which is always welcome
to keep things fresh and
innovative.
What’s Next
With the upcoming
release of the PS5
rumoured to be next
year, a lot is going to
change. A new console
requires new ideas and
who better for new ideas
than new people? The
PS5 is already rumoured
to have some never before
seen features, such as
full backwards compat-
ibility with every home
PlayStation console ever.
Not only that but with the
emergence of cloud-based
videogame streaming
services, the battlefield
that is the console war
may look very different.
Sony’s PlayStation Now
is looking to compete
with the big dogs: Google
Stadia and xCloud to name
a few and will need people
experienced with these
concepts to help push it
far beyond the compe-
tition. Shawn Layden is
58 and is unlikely to have
as much experience with
absolute powerhouse it
is today. Little is known
of what his plans for the
future are, but whatever
they are I wish him well
Hey Guys! Freddie

Andrew House, a long-
time leader of PlaySta-
tion… although in this
situation he was quickly
replaced.
Earlier this year we saw
the former Portfolio Exec-
utive, John Drake, leave
for Disney. However, the
biggest loss this year other
than Layden was Kaz
these ideas as someone a
bit younger who maybe
even grew up playing
games. This is not to say
that Layden is behind on
the time, but maybe the
reason for his departure
and the departure of many
others is to usher in a
new generation of minds
similar to the ushering
in of a new generation of
consoles next year.
So, thank you, Shawn,
for defining a big part of
many people’s lives and
