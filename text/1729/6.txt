A CONVERSATION WITH... felix@imperial.ac.uk
This week, Felix sat down with the Deputy President (Education), Ashley Brookes, to talk about his first weeks on
the job, including NSS and PRES survey responses, improvements to postgraduate research, and training for reps
Ashley Brookes, the DPE // ICU
Felix: So what have
you been doing in
the first couple of
months?
AB: The first thing I
looked at was the NSS and
the Union’s recommen-
dations to the College,
which we had to get ready
for the first Learning and
Teaching Committee
and Faculty Education
Committees of the year.
I’ve also been looking at
the PRES (Postgraduate
Research Experience
Survey) and will be
finalising results on that
in the next few weeks
before taking it to PRQC,
the Postgraduate Research
Quality Committee.
The LTC is a higher-level
committee focused on
broad college teaching
strategies, such as the
curriculum review. The
FECs consist of senior
staff from faculties along
with faculty-level student
reps. The PRQC is one
of the most senior com-
mittees at the College on
postgraduate research
matters.
AB: The Union recom-
mendations to the College
after the NSS are focused
on broader, college-wide
trends we can identify as
needing improvement.
Good examples are things
such as looking at what
one department may be
doing really well – such as
getting exam and lecture
timetables to students very
early, which is a general
policy at the college and
makes a big difference
to students’ revision and
project planning – and
then recommending that
other departments follow
suit.
Actual operational
changes are broadly
decided at the departmen-
tal or faculty level – after
the recommendations are
reviewed by the Provost
Board and LTC, they
move on to NSS Working
Groups who look at how
to apply those broad
principles within their de-
partments on the specific
level. I haven’t had one of
those yet, but I’m hoping
that at that stage we’ll start
getting into details, like
“your recommendation 13
probably is not possible
and here is why.”
Felix: Are all these
committees – the
level of bureaucra-
cy and the split of
decision-making by
seniority – helpful in
terms of actioning
change, or does it get
in the way?
AB: At this point it’s
hard to say, having only
attended one LTC. That’s
why I want to get to the
Working Groups to see
what changes do get made
– or whether things do
get shuffled around from
committee to committee.
Felix: Do operational
decisions need to
be made at a higher
level – for example,
does the LTC need
to actively enforce
adhering to policies
like getting exam
timetables to stu-
dents in reasonable
timeframes?
AB: Maybe there is some-
thing to be said for them
prodding departments
who fail to adhere to
policy a bit more – but
really, the conversations
should happen at faculty
or departmental level. The
desire and concern for en-
hancing and improving the
student experience is very
much there at the level of
FECs, where they’ve de-
veloped a nuanced way of
looking at NSS scores and
understanding the results.
Felix: Coming back to
the PRES and PRQC
– you’re interrupting
a PhD to take up the
DPE role. Compared
to previous DPEs,
who are usually
undergrads, are you
excited to get more
involved in postgrad
matters which have
been neglected in
the past?
AB: Absolutely. I was
the Vice President
(Representation) at the
Graduate Students’ Union
last year, so I’ve been to
PRQC a couple of times
before, and it’s something
I want to focus on this
year. I especially want
to liaise with the GSU in
order to have a collective
voice with which to im-
plement change. There’s
a big problem with quality
assurance on postgraduate
research placements,
which is emerging in the
PRES results – just a lot
of variance in students’
experiences, all highly de-
pendent on their relation-
ship with their supervisor,
which defines so much of
your life as a postgrad.
Felix: Do you want to
reform the way post-
graduate research
placements are run,
so that there is less of
a dependence on one
person and more of
a broader system in
place, like there is at
undergraduate level
with Senior Tutors
and DUGs and so on?
AB: Yes! The dependence
on one individual is the
problem – in engineering
we might call it a ‘single
point of failure’! There
need to be other people
and mechanisms in place
to be able to cope with
that and build a more re-
silient system – one where
a student’s experience
isn’t solely defined on the
‘luck of the draw’ with
their supervisor. A bad
relationship there can ruin
your entire PhD, unlike
at undergraduate level
where one bad course may
only affect you for a few
weeks.
Felix: How do the
postgraduate reps
play into this?
AB: Things get compli-
cated when you talk about
postgraduate research
reps. Unlike at undergrad,
there’s no ‘clean’ way of
divvying up by depart-
ment – you have different
doctoral training groups,
sections within depart-
ments, MRes students
going on to PhDs, and
so on. Alongside the fact
that PhDs don’t follow the
undergraduate academic
year – and thus don’t
follow the timescales
the elections and roles
are based on – often we
struggle to get postgrad
reps. In a number of de-
partments, they even end
up being locally elected
in processes organised by
College! I really want to
bring the postgrad reps in
this year, so the Union has
better input and oversight
of that process – we’re
even running separate
training sessions for
postgrad reps this year.
Felix: Regarding rep
training: some stu-
dent volunteers have
already been in roles
for four months – a
third of their tenure –
with no training, and
planning information
has not been sent out
other than a confir-
mation of the date of
training on October
23rd. Why?
AB: I wasn’t involved in
the process of planning
this year’s rep training
– that was organised last
year–andsoIcan’tstrictly
say. Regarding planning
information, I think that
high staff turnover at the
Union might have delayed
things while people get
to grips with their new
roles. Another problem is
that we haven’t finalised
all the elements of the
training sessions yet.
I’m hoping that a com-
munication will go out
this week about at least
a rough timetable. We’re
very lucky as a Union that
some of those untrained
volunteers – particularly
CU reps – have been able
to get on with things,
either as a result of a good
handover from predeces-
sors or them having been
very proactive. But it’s a
shame to have missed the
opportunity to give them
more support earlier on.
I think it’s unacceptable,
and training should have
happened earlier. If I’m
involved in that discus-
sion for next year, I will
support and encourage the
training for these roles to
happen a lot earlier, in the
July period.
