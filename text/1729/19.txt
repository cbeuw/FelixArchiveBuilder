Introducing GioLeo: Imperial’s New Rap Duo
R
apper and
producer aren’t
ever words that
I associate with
MechEng, and yet this last
Saturday I sat down with
Gio: MechEng student
and lead vocalist of trap
duo GioLeo. Along with
fellow engineer Leo, the
pair have been producing
music together since the
end of last year. Beginning
this July under the title
GioLeo (genius name)
they have been releasing
music to the public. The
duo now has five songs
out on Spotify. Gio was
surprised when I asked
him about their song on
Soundcloud. Turns out
they didn’t post it, but they
must be doing something
right if someone’s stealing
their music.
In true Imperial spirit
they’ve decided to make
internationalism one of
their key ideals and artistic
motives. As we’re talking
about why students
should go check them out,
Gio leans into the micro-
phone to directly address
IC students - “…that’s
one of the most beautiful
things of imperial is how
international it is. We
believe that the hip-hop
world has alienated a lot
of your beautiful languag-
es and cultures, GioLeo
is a reaction against that
oppression and we’re
refocusing music onto a
wider range of cultures”.
GioLeo’s international
reach isn’t just an idea,
it’s already being put
into practice. Raised in
Shanghai, Leo is fluent
in Mandarin and Gio has
been learning, now incor-
porating it into his verses.
The track “Live Life”
features a friend of theirs
- Monica Curtin -singing
in Spanish, and their most
recent release features
a Guinean rapper who’s
vocals are in Sousou. As
for the future, the pair
are in contact with an
Angolan rapper, Chinese
rapper, Burmese singer
and American rapper
Ryan Oakes.
Despite all these inter-
national collaborations,
they seem pretty set on
working within Western
trap/hip-hop/pop style.
“Many of my friends not
from the west aren’t fans
of trap music from their
own countries” Gio says,
“they enjoy the production
and style of Western trap,
so we want to provide
that but with a bridge for
the culture”. The boys
take their production
influences from Justin
Stone, Shawn Mendez,
Major Lazer and Drake.
However, their desire to
expand genres is leaving
them open to further in-
fluence from artists across
the world.
From last December
Leo has been working
hard to learn the ropes
of production with help
from fellow Imperialites.
Their hunger to grow is
still strong and they’re
welcoming any other
students to come be a part
of the process. It’s not just
music either, a possible
ICTVxGioLeo collab
music video for their
debut single GAMMA is
in the works. At the end
of our conversation Gio
once again reaches out
to the IC students saying,
“anyone who has had a
dream of singing, making
music or rapping, please
reach out to Gio and Leo
[@xgioleox], because
what we really love is
collaborating and making
music with other people”.
Danny Brown Lets Us Down
D
anny Brown
has become
something of
a legend of the
underground hip-hop cir-
cuit this decade, with the
ability to rhyme almost an-
ything, an imppecable wit
and a penchant for insane
beats. On epic albums
like XXX and Atrocity
Exhibition Brown
explores his lifestyle
as a drug dealer-turned
drug fiend, painting the
synapse-searing highs
and depressing lows of
the lifestyle in agonising
detail. It is these, often
experimental records he is
best known for.
Relatively fresh off the
high of 2016’s Atrocity
Exhibition, the news
that Danny Brown was
working with a “legend-
ary” producer, built hope
that he would be able to
deliver another stellar
blend of lyricism and
off-kilter instrumentals.
El-P of Run the Jewels
tweeted in January that
he had heard Brown’s
new record and that it was
“an instant classic”, news
followed in April that
Q-tip, hip-hop veteran,
MC and producer was
the legend Brown spoke
of, it seemed certain that
uknowwhatimsayin?
would be an impactful
record, sadly, Danny
Brown’s latest offering
comes to less than the sum
of its parts.
The record opens with
‘Change Up’, a shuffling,
low-key beat that sees
Danny delivering decent,
but ultimately uninter-
esting verses on how he
“never looks back” and
has to “keep going”, the
track lacks any musical or
lyrical elements to draw
a listener back. ‘Theme
Song’ packs another weak
punch, with old-school
samples lumbering behind
what appears to be a diss
track for “bitch-ass”
rappers, there is no doubt
that Brown knows how to
throw an insult but nothing
here compares to tracks
like ‘Monopoly’ where he
decries foes for “rocking
crocs at Walmart”.
While Singles ‘Dirty
Laundry’ and ‘3 tears’
have interesting beats
courtesy of Q-Tip and
JPEGMAFIA respec-
tively, Brown once again
fails to bring his A-game.
On ‘Dirty Laundry’ the
influences from comedi-
ans (particularly Richard
Pryor) Brown spoke of in
the lead up to the album’s
release are visible, with
a lackadaisical delivery
full of pauses, serving
wordplay filled anecdotes
about sex, drugs and
laundry.
Tracks ‘Belly of the
Beast’, ‘Best Life’ and
‘uknowhatimsayin?’
all bring watery and
somewhat aimless instru-
mentals behind half-heart-
ed bars, but toward the
end of the album’s 30
minutes a few tracks
do stand out. ‘Savage
Nomad’ a direct groove
that could have come
straight from underground
producer Alchemist’s
vault sees Brown on re-
spectable form with bars
and one-liners about his
past life as a drug dealer.
Features from Blood
Orange and JPEGMAFIA
are both standouts, with
strong hooks that help
pull their respective tracks
together.
Finally, closer Q-tip
produced ‘Combat’ brings
a driving beat, adorned
with bumbling jazz-trum-
pet and Brown’s strongest
verses on the record, the
line “I’ll die for this shit
like Elvis” alone makes
the track a worthwhile
listen.
While unknowha-
timsayin? delivers
instrumentals and verses
that are more interesting
than the average hip-hop
record it is far from El-P’s
promised “instant classic”
and is certainly a weaker
point in Brown’s discog-
raphy.
