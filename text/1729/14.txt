Love and Loss, Music and Mourning
T
his Autumn,
the English
National Opera
is presenting an
“Orpheus” series with
four operas from different
historical periods that
retell the myth. The first
of these comes from the
mid-eighteenth century:
‘Orfeo ed Euridice’, by
Gluck. It is of particular
importance in the history
of music as it marks the
turn to a simpler aesthetic,
focused on expressively
conveying the plot, that
mediated the transition
from baroque to classical
operas.
Orpheus, played by
Alice Coote, mourns
the death of his wife
Eurydice, portrayed by
Sarah Tynan, and decides
to retrieve her from the
Underworld. Coote’s sore
throat in the opening night
didn’t spoil her enraged
lamentations, punctuated
by a greek tragedy style
chorus. In the Under-
world, a psychedelic
swirl of strobe lights and
colour, Orpheus charms
the gods with his music
and is allowed to bring
Eurydice back, under the
condition that he shouldn’t
look or talk to her before
returning to the realm of
the living. Tempted by
his wife’s protests against
his silence, he breaks
this promise and loses
Eurydice for a second
time. This is an intense
scene that brings out both
singers’ acting abilities,
especially because they
are completely alone on
stage for a long time.
Then Gluck’s version
differs from the traditional
tragedy as Love, through
the voice of Soraya Mafi,
restores Eurydice’s life as
a reward for the couple’s
true love and they reunite
in a delicate dance.
Spotless musical per-
formance by the orchestra,
conducted by Harry
Bicket, accompanies the
whole performance. It
advances the progression
of the story but also
provides moments of rest
and references to past and
future events. Unfortu-
nately, ENO’s policy of
singing only in English,
to enhance emotional con-
nection with the audience,
although admirable, fails
to pay absolute justice to
the original Italian work.
The poetic translation
respects the metric of the
music but the musicality
of the original text is lost.
It is really disappointing
for an aficionado to hear
“What is life without
you near me” instead of
“Che farò senza Euridice”
(What will I do without
Eurydice). It doesn’t mean
quite the same!
The production is
directed by choreographer
Wayne McGregor, which
results in an organic
fusion of music and
dance. In fact, fourteen
dancers join the three lead
singers on stage, adding
movement and shape to
an otherwise clean set. A
highlight of the show is
the clever way in which
light and shadows are
exploited in conjunction
with the dancers’ bodies,
projecting entrancing
living pictures on the
walls. The dance numbers
are well constructed,
lively and of sublime
beauty, well articulated
with the composer’s prin-
ciples of simplicity and
expressivity.
Expressivity really is
at the core of this opera.
Subtle elements direct the
audience to new, nuanced
readings of the story, in
line with modern inter-
pretations of the myth.
The cyclic structure of
this production, present in
the costumes and sets, the
palette of dance move-
ments and a surprising
final scene - hints at this
being an allegory for the
process of grieving. After
all, is this journey just
happening in Orpheus’
mind? And would that
make it any less real?
Nara: Sacred Images from Early Japan
T
he city of Nara in
Japan is perhaps
b e s t - k n o w n
today for the
large number of deer
found roaming in Nara
park. However, make
your way through these
creatures once regarded
as divine and you’ll
find Todaiji temple, one
of Japan’s largest and
most historically signif-
icant Buddhist temples.
Originally constructed in
752, it houses a collection
of over 9,000 sacred art
objects, with many having
such cultural value that
they are deemed national
treasures. It is these that
are the subject of the new
British Museum exhibi-
tion ‘Nara: sacred images
from early Japan’.
This display brings to-
gether a collection of 15
Buddhist and Shinto ob-
jects from various temples
and shrines across Nara.
Among the items on view
are five national treasures,
none of which have ever
been in the UK. On show
alongside the objects are
a collection of paintings
from the British Muse-
ums’ own collection.
The collection exhibit-
ed is small, but this works
in its favour as there is
nothing superfluous here.
Each object is beautiful
and in a remarkable con-
dition given that some of
them are over 1000 years
old. Highlights include
‘Yumechigai Kannon’,
a 1300-year-old bronze
sculpture of a deity be-
lieved to be able to change
bad dreams to good ones,
and the wonderfully ex-
pressive ‘Divine Kings’,
two wooden statues
perched atop a pair of
worried-looking demons.
This exhibition is split
across two rooms, annoy-
ingly on opposite ends and
different floors of the mu-
seum. Most of the display
can be found in the newly
renovated Japanese Gal-
leries. The natural wood
and white walls work
well, giving the impres-
sion of the temples where
the items normally reside.
However, the pairing of
such significant objects
with the paintings from
the museums own collec-
tion can at times mean
they distract from each
other. The objects are the
stars here, so perhaps it
would have been better to
give them a bit more room
to breathe without the ad-
ditions .
An emphasis has been
placed on this exhibition
being a cultural exchange,
which is understandable
given the complicated his-
tory involved with some
of the key items in the
British Museum’s collec-
tion. In making your way
to the Japanese galleries
you might pass the Easter
Island statue (maoi), Hoa
Hakananai’a, which re-
ceived emotional pleas for
its return from the Easter
Island governor in 2018.
We are truly lucky to be
able to see such an object
in person, but the experi-
ence is tarnished knowing
the culture that created it
desperately wants it back,
and that their requests
have been refused. This
is absent from the Nara
display, where there is a
real sense of enthusiasm
from those in Nara who
helped organise the ex-
hibition. The governor
of Nara Prefecture, Arai
Shogo, speaking of the
art on loan, hoped this ex-
hibition would ‘convey
their beauty and spiritual
essence’, which it certain-
ly does.
If you have any inter-
est in Japan, the beautiful
collection of objects at
this short-but-sweet exhi-
bition is worth a visit.
