We should all stop fucking swearing
This week, Grumpy Bastard puts profanity on the hotseat

W
e live in
a society.
One that
swears too
much. We are bombarded
by expletives on the
internet, in film, music,
television, literature (and
somesub-par“journalism”
outlets). It has corrupted
the youth and rooted
itself deep into modern
popular culture. Profanity
has taken control of us
and invaded our lives.
Swearing can be effective
within context, but this
overgrowth of colourful
language has embittered
ourpalateforgood,healthy
conversations.
Swearing is defined to
be the use of “offensive
language, especially as
an expression of anger.”
This is incredibly prob-
lematic in several ways.
Many swear words are
intended as a direct
attack on some members
of society. The oppressed
always have slang terms
that were imposed on
them by persecutors.
The underclass of the
age will have negative
words associated with
them.
Through history:
women, people of
colour, and LGBTQ+
people (in loose chron-
ological order) have
endured lasting offen-
sive terms used against
them. At least in the
English language, the
proprietors and gate-
keepers of profanity are
the part of society that
have the least deroga-
tory words describing
them. The middle-class
white $man^{TM}$.
Thus, when those pre-
viously oppressed ret-
rospectively speak out,
and indulge themselves
in the same forbidden
fruit of profanity, they
are quickly met with vit-
riolic backlash from the
Caucasian community.
This is no good thing
either but should make
some of us consider if
we should be using the
words that we force upon
others or respect the
words that those people
have chosen themselves.
These examples are not
exhaustive but please
don’t feel free to write
your own slang term
for [your least favourite
ethnic group here].
Cursing comes
from a place of anger,
often directly aimed
at a thing or person.
Anger is neither good
for your soul or others
on the receiving end.
To treat everyone with
respect is a rare thing
these days. There is no
need for this aggressive
attitude; please, think
of the children. Adults
will self-censor so as
to behave differently
around children, and
there exist restrictions
for sweary music, films,
and television pro-
grammes so that young
people are not exposed
to them. I’m not the one
to tell you how to raise
your kids - but telling
your child to “fuck off”
during your wino wind
down because you had a
tough day at work isn’t
going to do them any
good. The apple will
not fall far from the tree
or fall at all but rather
rot at the branch if you
don’t have a clue how to
garden.
Fuck is a versatile
word, I digress. The
pure joy and splendour
of seeing it printed in
books at the school
library were spellbind-
ing. Now, it has lost
its charm through its
overuse. Before, it was a
word that strongly shook
me to my core, but the
overexposure causing
desensitisation renders
the word meaningless,
adding fuck for the
flow and aesthetics of a
sentence a la Malcolm
Tucker. But remember:
it’s not fucking cool
to swear every other
fucking word, because
that’s fucking almost a

fucking speech imped-
iment. Restrain your
language for genuine
circumstances and real
situations.
Alas, there’s hope out
there. A culture built on
respect for others and
a respect for the words
being used is growing
and brewing a new
generation of people.
I hope. All I ask is that
you all should carefully
consider what you say,
because words can mean
things.

you think you can write,
