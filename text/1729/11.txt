Brexit Developments: New PM StanceAnd Operation
Yellowhammer
Johnson’s deal is refused over Irish backstop while an extension seems probable, as prospects for a no deal seem
dim
POLITICS

S
everal notewor-
thy events have
recently occurred
relating to an old
subject: Brexit. Asking
for a postponement is
actually required by law,
the Benn Act, which
received Royal Assent
by the Queen on 9th
September. Johnson’s
government con-
firmed last Friday
that the Prime Minister
will indeed ask for a
delay on 19th October
if no deal between the
United Kingdom and
the European Union is
reached by then. The piece
of legislation provides
requirements surround-
ing the phrasing of the
letterthatJohnsonwillhave
to write, which dramat-
ically reduced, but has
not excluded, the pos-
sibility of finding a
“hole” through which he
can ignore the will
of Parliament and in-
stead head for a no deal
scenario.
In the past, many
members of the Govern-
ment have been outspo-
ken about pursuing an
extension, includ-
ing Foreign Secretary
Dominic Raab and the
Chancellor of the Duchy
of Lancaster Michael
Gove. The Prime Minister
himself declared that he
would “rather be dead in a
ditch”thandefertheBrexit
saga to January 31st,
the new possible date set
by the House of
Commons for UK depar-
ture. However, Johnson
believes that he can still
reach a deal before having
to write to Brussels, an
d on Thursday October
3rd unveiled plans that
made new concessions
to the EU concerning the
Irish backstop question.
According to these plans,
Northern Ireland would
abide to single market reg-
ulations for manu-
factured goods and
food, and that this would
be subjected to a decision
taken every four
years by the NI
Assembly. Both the EU
and the Irish Govern-
ment have expressed scep-
ticism about the feasibility
of such measures, which
would require border
checks. These have
been deemed by
many to under-
mine the commitments of
the Good Friday Agree-
mentthatwasputinplaceto
end the fierce conflict in
the region. In the Brexit
debate, the Leader of
the House, Jacob
Rees-Mogg, has pre-
viously suggested the
possibility of exclu-
sively implement-
ing digital checks, but
it has also been
stressed that nowhere
in the world are such
controls already in place.
Furthermore, the question
arises as to whether it’s
wise to introduce such
checks while being about
to leave the block, in
a region where sec-
tarian violence could
easily be revived. Despite
his best efforts, Johnson’s
proposal for the backstop
has been “ditched” by
EU leaders due
to concerns that his propo-
sition is untested and “not
serious at all”, however,
European Commission
President Jean-Claude
Juncker told MEPs that he
would not exclude a deal
in the coming days.
On this note, the PM
has reiterated his view
that the main cause for a
deal not being agreed
yet is the EU’s unwill-
ingness to negotiate. In
contrast, Secretary of
State for Work and
Pensions Amber Rudd
resigned on the 7th of
September, citing the
government’s disinterest
in negotiating a deal
and denouncing that its
focus has been solely on
preparing for a hard
Brexit. In fact, the gov-
ernment announced at the
end of July that an extra
2.1 billion pounds would
be spent on prepara-
tions for a no-deal Brexit,
to stockpile medicine,
set up new border and
customs operations,
and improve infrastruc-
ture at ports.
However, the level
of the nation’s prepara-
ly seems improbable. On
the economic side, in-
flation could impact the
social care sector and the
overall price of imported
goods might increase, af-
fecting the lower class in
particular. Many busi-
nesses on the Irish border
could be severely struck,
with the risk of rising
unemployment and the
development of illegal
activities in proximity of
the border. Disruption
would also manifest in the
form of consistent queues
in Kent, towards Dover,
with a worst-case estima-
tion of travel time neces-
sary for a lorry to cross
the French border exceed-
ing 2 days. Emergency
plans by the government
under the code name
Operation Brock include
the possibility of leaving
two thousand lorries in
a separate queue, whilst
allowing traffic to
continue through other
routes. Other lorries, up
to six thousand, could
be parked in a disbanded
airfield nearby while
waiting for traffic to
proceed. Finally, in case
of absolute necessity, the
entire M26 motorway
could be closed and trans-
formed into a provisional
parking place.
Considering these
emerging details, as well
as the contradictory state-
mentscomingfromWhite-
hall, UK politics seems
to be preparing itself
for another extenuat-
ing week; the forecast to
leave by 31st October
seems to be increasing-
ly difficult to meet as a fog
of uncertainty perpetuates
its fatal embrace over the
British Isles.

“The Prime
Minister
declared he
would rather
be‘dead in
a ditch’than
defer Brexit”
tion for a no deal scenario
has been put into question
when a government
report called Oper-
ation Yellowham-
mer, which outlined the
government’s plan to
leave the EU with a no
deal, was published last
month. While Johnson
has stated that everyone
who needs fundamental
medicines will get them,
the report affirms that
supply chains for med-
ication is “particularly
vulnerable”. The report
mentions the probable
unavailability of key
ingredients in the short
term and the overall
reduction of choice in
supermarkets, though a
