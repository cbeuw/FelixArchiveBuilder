“This is for the Players”, but is it for the leaders? Shawn
With the PS5 just announced for holiday 2020,
development is likely coming to an end. One would
likely think that this is the worst possible time for high
up members of Sony Interactive Entertainment. Despite
this, both Kaz Hirai (ex-chairman of Sony) and Shawn
Layden (ex-chairman of SIE) have left this year alone.
Read on for insight onto the possible reasons for why he
left, as well as the legacy he left behind with some of his
major video game credits

“Heart-
warming
words on
display make it
clear that there
was no bad
blood.”
A
fter 32 years
working at
Sony, Shawn
Layden be-
comes the latest in a long
list of executives to leave
the company. On 1st
October he stepped down
as the Chairman of Sony
Worldwide Studios after
3 years in that position .
There has been no official
statement as to why he
has stepped down, nor has
there been any mention
of a potential successor.
Many people know
Shawn as the face of Sony
(at least during E3) and
remember seeing him
onstage as a part of the big
3 at the game awards last
December. This makes his
leaving feel reminiscent
of Regi Fils-Amié’s
(Nintendo of America)
departure earlier this year.
An Official State-
ment by Sony’s Twitter
account said, “It is with
great emotion that we
announce that Worldwide
Studios Chairman Shawn
Layden will be departing
SIE.” They then go on to
note that “His visionary
leadership will be greatly
missed.” And that “We
wish him success in future
endeavors and are deeply
grateful for his years
of service. Thanks for
everything, Shawn!”
Such heart-warming
words on display make
it clear that there was no
bad blood between Shawn
and the rest of Sony, and
with the PS5 just around
the corner maybe it is
time for a fresh set of eyes
to take up the mantle of
Chairman.
Now that his dec-
ades-long career of
climbing Sony’s ranks has
come to an end , let’s look
at the legacy of Shawn, the
strange pattern of people
leaving Sony and a look at
what to expect from Sony
Interactive Entertainment
next.
Legacy
The first thing to note
about Shawn Layden is
that his position at Sony
has not always been as
large and illustrious as it
was in recent years. His
tenure with Sony began
way back in the 1980s. He
began in 1987 in the com-
munications department,
Tokyo, where he acted as
a communications assis-
tant for several years.
Until 1999 he managed
international software de-
velopment from London
where he was credited in
many games such as Gran
Turismo 2. The next 8
years of his career would
go on to be very influ-
ential as he would hold
the mantle of Vice Pres-
ident of Sony Computer
Entertainment Europe.
the PS3’s success. He
was the main supervisor
on projects such as Little
Big Planet, Demon Souls
and again, Gran Turismo;
he was also an executive
producer of Gran Turismo
5.
In 2010 he was one of
the founding members of
Sony Network Entertain-
ment International (the
basis for PSN) as well
becoming the COO and
Vice President. In 2014
Shawn Layden succeeded
Jack Tretton as Presi-
dent and CEO of Sony
Computer Entertainment
America. This is how he
became the face of Sony
in the west, appearing in
all Sony E3 conferences
from 2014-2018 and being
pivotal in the success of
the PS4.
In 2016 he became the
Chairman of Sony World-
wide Studios, overseeing
the latter 3 years of the
PS4 as it surged to dom-
inance selling over 100
million units. Games such
as God of War,
Horizon: Zero Dawn,
Days Gone and who can
forget the ever loved:
Knack 2 where all made
under his leadership.
Not only this, but
Layden played a funda-
mental role in acquiring

Marvel’s Spider-Man and
