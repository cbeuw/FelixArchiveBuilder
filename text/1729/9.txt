E
xtinction rebel-
lion (XR for
short) has hit
the streets of
the UK and is being just
as provocative as usual.
Opinions of this current
movement of concerned
climate revolutionaries
vary greatly, depending on
who you are, and whether
you are trying to get to
work or not. The young,
in general, are far more
pro-XR than the old who
are probably still trying to
work out whether having
petrol drenched seagulls
for breakfast is a bad idea
yet.
XR, frustrated with the
lack of response to the im-
pending Climate Change
induced disaster from
central government have
turned to the Vietnam era
method of inspiring polit-
ical change – civil disobe-
dience. Methods such as
mass protest, gluing them-
selves to public transport
and in general being a
nuisance are specialties
now widely associated
with the sandal wearing,
lettuce loving environ-
mental enthusiasts. The
overall effectiveness of
this method for achieving
their objectives remains to
be seen.
XR in the UK have tree
main demands:
Government must tell
the truth by declaring a
climate and ecological
emergency, working with
other institutions to com-
municate the urgency for
change.
Government must act
now to halt biodiversity
loss and reduce green-
house gas emissions to
net-zero by 2025.
Government must
create, and be led by the
decisions of, a citizens’
assembly on climate and
ecological justice.
The first two demands
appear reasonable.
Declaring a climate
emergency would be in
line with the policies of
other governments such
as Canada and probably
matches the level of
gut-wrenching fear we
should be experiencing
when considering the
prospect of the potential
for chaos as a result
of a Climate Change
induced alterations to the
habitability of the entire
coastline. Unless you’re
from Norfolk, or perhaps
Windsor, you’re unlikely
to be equipped with gills,
or the webbed feet to
thrive in 2050 Blackpool.
The government acting
now would be a very
sensible thing. Reducing
emissions to net-zero by
2025 would likely be very
challenging, but perhaps
we could manage it.
It is the final demand
that I truly take issue
with. The formation of
a citizens’ assembly to
oversee the decisions of
the UK parliament is truly
moronic. I understand that
they are mostly composed
of anarchists and left
leaning libertarians that
trust central government
as much as a Kulak in
the 1930s, but honestly.
Their proposal is to take
100 random members of
society and assign them a
leading role in combatting
climate change. To quote
a television programme,
“the problem with the
public, is that they’re
fucking horrible.” If you
thought it was easy for
corporations to manip-
ulate politicians to their
ends, you’d be surprised
how little it takes to get
a standard human being
to go from respectable to
despicable. Give a person
a breadknife, a fiver and
a sense of national pride
and watch them go and
commit atrocities.
That’s the thing that
really annoys me about
XR. They’ve forgotten
that the main reason
Vietnam stopped wasn’t
the protests- it was the
NVA fucking murdering
everyone.
