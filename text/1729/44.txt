New Council Chair disappoints everyone already
HANGMAN
Negafelix
Editor-in-Chief
Disappointment this
week as Council Chair
Floyd Jamesweather
committed the
body to openness
and transparency,
in a cowardly
maintenance of the
status quo.
A
veteran of
the RCSU’s
Committee on
Finding Out if
Committees Work, and
a long standing critic of
the bureaucratic ineffec-
tiveness he had faced
while dealing with the
College and Union, ob-
servers had hoped that
he would declare himself
Chancellor, ending the
years of stagnation and
inertia. However, in the
first Council session of
the year He declared in
his maiden speech that
he was “a big fan of stu-
dent consultation” and
“looked forward to mak-
ing the Council more
representative” which
was met by groans from
all around the room.
In a now character-
istically weak move
Jamesweather didn’t even
take advantage of poorly
written statute books to
seize power. When it
came to light that he had
the right to override Pro-
cedural Motions, includ-
ing Procedural Motions
to overturn his decisions
he was heard to mutter
“this can’t be right” and
“well, we will have to do
something about this”,
horrifying onlookers.
Jamesweather an-
nounced that he wouldn’t
allow himself to overturn
any decisions to overturn
his decisions made by
Council. He also commit-
ted to reducing the verbos-
ity and “over-specificity”
of the constitutional doc-
ument. The point was
slightly lost by the length
Councils, which had
previously prided them-
selves on being “utterly
unintelligible and impen-
etrable” – particularly to
new members of Council
who reportedly receive no
training on understanding
what the hell is going on
before being asked to
ratify the entire constitu-
tional document.
For once, we here in the
NegaFelix offices wish the
Union well in confound-
ing the Council’s plans.
The sense of betrayal
among union watchers is
so great as his background
seemed to make him a
perfect candidate for
autocratic rule, having
Floyd Jamesweather. We know what you are// Youtube
gone on record before to
criticise the Union for
having “enough red tape
to strangle a moose”.
Timothy Gross, leader
of the opposition, was the
most disappointed of all.
“What do you mean I still
have to go to these things?
I only voted for him to
abolish Council and free
up my Tuesday after-
noons”. All is not lost,
however, with reports of
Gross raising his middle
finger in the vague direc-
tion of the Union building
and making a loud farting
noise givings us here at
NegaFelix hope for the
future.
“I only voted
for him to
abolish Council
and free up
my Tuesday
afternoons”
of the speech promising it,
which took several hours.
This new direction
from Jamesweather is
