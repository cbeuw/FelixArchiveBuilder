ICXCAC a tale of two summer tours

fter a very
successful year
which saw
the Women’s
A team winning the
London Universities
Cross-Country League,
the Women’s B team
coming 3rd and the
Men’s A coming in 2nd
place and athletes per-
forming extremely well
individually at BUCS,
the Cross-Country and
Athletics Club hit the
mountains twice over the
course of this Summer,
making the most of the
long summer days.
The trail team was first
to set off as they made
their way to Chamonix the
first week of July. Upon
arrival, having been blown
away by the beautiful
scenery the year before,
they headed straight to
Lac Vert, through tricky
paths and cold streams. As
the cheerful dozen reached
the lake, the bravest went
in for a swim in the crys-
tal-clear water. Up early
the next day to make the
most of their time there,
the party embarked on
their long climb up to
Mer de Glace, tackling a
hefty 1400m of elevation
amidst the intimidating
peaks and under a glorious
sunshine. Spirits were as
high as these mountains.
For their third day, more
lake-packed action was in
store as the crew headed
North and climbed upto
Lac d’Emosson, getting
more mileage in and going
here.
Although not the VK
most consume on their
average Wednesday
evening, this was a tiring
effort all of them savoured
as they reached the top
as well as during the
following run down the
mountain, which unsur-
prisingly felt much faster,
burning all that potential
energy. As a rest day was
never an option, ex-Trail
captain and newly-elected
president Henry Hart
and trail-lover Heinrich
Hummel took on the
Matterhorn expedition,
leaving in the cold hours
of 4am. Despite not quite
reaching the summit, the
duo still saw a beautiful
sunrise and put in a valiant
effort on this very tactical
mountain path.
On their final day, the
brave squad lined up at
the start of the Zermatt
Marathon; with nearly
2000m elevation distrib-
uted over the course of the
marathon, the group took
part in this beautiful race
either on their own or as
a duo, marking the perfect
end to a week of exem-
plary trail running and
countless calories burnt
climbing up and down
the peaks of Chamonix.

through Switzerland.
The following day,
always eager to do more,
the company went on to
climb the 1800m separat-
ing them from Mont Buet
on another very strong
effort. This brave bunch
then decided to climb a
vertical kilometre from
Chamonix: those unfa-
miliar with the concept
simply need to imagine
a near-straight path with
a kilometer of elevation
gain on as short a distance
as possible, roughly 4km
will remember and look
forward to repeating next
summer!
W ith summer progress-
ing, preparations for the
next tour came to life in
the early hours of Septem-
ber, as Imperial’s brightest
and fittest converged to
Heathrow’s Wetherspoons
ready to board their
plane for Munich, before
meeting up with the rest
of the gang and heading
to Austria for a week
of running, swimming,
sun-bathing and self-care.
Upon their arrival
and witnessing the end
of the Zell-Am-See
Half-Ironman race, the
club was welcome by
torrential rain, but this
didn’t dampen their spirits
as they converged towards
the local pub to experience
traditional Austrian deli-
cacies. Although the rain
had stopped overnight,
the skies weren’t quite
clear yet as the group
left the villa for their first
run. A 10km loop around
the lake for most and the
steep climb up Hundstein
for the trail enthusiasts.
This was followed by a
more laid-back afternoon,
with the optional core
training session. While
some favoured the plank
sets, others were getting
familiar with the local
brews; when in Austria…
The next day saw part
of team run around the
lake while the rest, led
by Tour organiser Filip,
climbed up to the Mooser-
boden reservoir, walking
past the impressive
Kesselfall gorge. Upon
reaching the lake at lunch-
time, the hikers rewarded
themselves with some
more traditional Austrian
meals and a well-deserved
nap by the lake.
The following two days
saw the club members take
part in much more than
just running: with tennis
performances worthy of
Wimbledon, sunbathing
and swimming in the local
lake of Zell-Am-See and
finally spending a day at
the spa, the mid-week saw
slightly less running for
some, but the water slides
and numerous games
provided their legs with
a happy break before the
rest of tour.
The next day saw
different groups head
towards different moun-
tains, with the most
enthusiastic tackling the
Kitzsteinhorn. While the
glacier presented a severe
obstacle, the hike or jog
leading to it, nearing the
2000m elevation in the
mist and the cold was
appreciated by all.
As the week drew to its
end, the club decided to hit
the local club for a night
of memorable (for some)
dancing and partying. The
next day saw most recover
from the night out and go
on unsurprisingly shorter
runs than the rest of the
week, at the exception of
the night-time treasure
hunt that concluded the
trip, where some compet-
itors gave it everything
and sprinted most of it and
others opted for a more
laid-back approach and
simply enjoyed the walk
around the nearby hills
and paths.
The next morning,
the islanders said their
goodbyes to the Villa and
went home to London,
ending their trip with a
pint at Hammerspoons.
