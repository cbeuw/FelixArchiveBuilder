BP Should Pay RSC More
Comment editor Calum Drysdale argues that divesting makes pariahs out of BP and a mob
out of activists

W
hile activ-
ists might
feel flushed
with vic-
tory, they have damaged
the funding sources of the
RSC without offering a
credible alternative.
I can only imagine that
a sound like an airplane
loo flushing went around
the auditorium, there
was so much indrawing
of breath, after Richard
Dawkins admitted that
maybe God wasn’t such a
bad idea after all.
Speaking at Chelten-
ham Literature festival
Dawkins told the audience
about an honesty box to
pay for coffee that one of
his former students had
installed at their research
lab.
“They help themselves
to coffee and they are
supposed to put money
in the box and each week
the honesty box takes in
less than the amount of
coffee taken”. When a
pair of eyes were drawn
on the box, however, the
takings for the next week
were much higher.” He
wonderedwhetherwithout
a “divine spy camera in
the sky reading their every
thought” people would be
more willing to do wrong.
While not much of
a story in itself, it does
highlight an important
point. Guilt, while not
the most popular emotion
these days, can be a great
force for good when it
drives people to behave
better.
The Royal Shakespeare
company has recently
halted a partnership with
BP that funded subsidised
£5 16-25 youth tickets
to all performances after
coming under sustained
pressure from climate or-
ganisations such as To BP
Or Not BP, youth groups
and the resignation of
Mark Rylance on environ-
mental and BP divestment
grounds.
In his resignation letter,
Rylance explained that
the sponsorship gave BP a
blank cheque to continue
polluting by allowing it to
“obscure the destructive
reality of its activities”
through philanthropic and
arts funding.
“I do not wish to be
associated with BP any
more than I would with
an arms dealer, a tobacco
salesman or anyone who
wilfully destroys the lives
of others alive and unborn.
Nor, I believe, would
William Shakespeare,”
While my inner cur-
mudgeon instinctively
reacts against this and
scoffs at his historical re-
visionism the facts of the
case speak for themselves.
BP is the 6th most
polluting company in the
world, pumping out 34
billion tonnes of carbon
dioxide a year, they have
actively lobbied the
Trump administration to
expand oil exploration
and drilling in the Arctic
and have propped up
and traded with regimes
which have been accused
of serious human rights
violations in Azerbaijan,
Algeria, Libya, Indonesia,
and other countries. This
is on top of the ecological
damage caused by disas-
ters such as the Deepwater
horizon drilling rig explo-
sion which released just
under 200 million gallons
into the ocean – the
largest marine oil accident
in US history. Despite all
this, in 2018 BP’s profit
rose to a five-year high
of $12.7 billion, double
the previous year’s $6.17
billion.
The RSC sponsorship
on the other hand is
thought to make up only
0.6% of the RSC budget
and combined sponsorship
to the British Museum,
the National Portrait
Gallery, the Royal Opera
House and the Royal
Shakespeare Company
amounted to only £7.5
million over five years.
The small size of the
sponsorship deal is at odds
with the positive effect
that these sponsorship
deals can have for BP’s
reputation. At an AGM
in 2012, BP admitted
that sponsorship deals go
through “exactly the same
processes as we would for
any investment”. Further-
more, research by spon-
sorship specialist Havas
Sports & Entertainment
showed that of the people
aware of BP’s sponsorship
of the Olympic games
38% believed BP that
had been getting better at
working towards a cleaner
planet. Importantly, this
was in 2012, only a year
after Deepwater Horizon.
The point is that BP
clearly understands the
value of sponsorship
deals when it comes to
improving their image.
Institutions like the Royal
this doesn’t address the
funding hole that this will
leave. Proposals for the
government to make up
the difference are naïve at
best.
Instead, our cultural
institutions should
recognise the value of
a sponsorship deal and
charge for them correctly.
Just like carbon offsetting
places a financial cost on
companies that are pol-
luting by charging them
per ton of CO2, providing
a financial incentive
to decrease emissions,
companies trying to repair
their reputation should
have to pay dearly for it.
While forcing the RSC
to bow under pressure
might give the activists
involved in the campaign
a rush of pleasure, they
should not feel that they
have advanced the cause
of environmentalism.
Instead, BP just has more
money and a valuable
institution has less.
Rather than disassoci-
ate themselves from BP
the RSC should simply
remove the BP logo from
their tickets and website
and continue to accept the
money. If BP complains,
the RSC should simply
explain that BP adversely
affects the reputation
of the RSC and that if
they wish to associate
themselves with some of
Britain’s most important
cultural institutions, they
must either pay more or
improve their reputations.
If we keep our eyes on
BP, acting as the judges
that refuse to engage with
them unless they improve
their behaviour, maybe
BP can be forced to put a
couple more pounds into
the pot.

haven’t realised and are
therefore selling them-
selves short. To return to
the example that began
this article rather than
putting the correct amount
of money into the arts
and culture honesty box
to offset the harm that
they do BP has managed
to get themselves into a
situation where they toss
a few pennies onto the
floor and everyone thanks
them for their generous
contribution.
By cutting off funding
deals with BP the RSC
has made the first step,
recognising the error of
providing reputational
relief to companies at
such a low rate. However,
“BP clearly
understands
the value of
sponsorship
deals“
