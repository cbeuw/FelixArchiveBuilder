“It’s been
enjoyable to
engage with
faces both new
and old”
and a printed web article
about “Why I Quit Dating
Girls Who Club, Party or
Drink”), I had a moment to
collect my thoughts. One
question remained: “what
the hell do I write about?”
With nothing much ap-
proaching except a stream
of consciousness, I guess
I had better just give my
review of Welcome from
the perspective of a senior
Student Volunteer, and in
the meantime not-so-sub-
tly comment on the utter
state of my life.
A great deal of prepa-
ration went into Welcome
Week (at least from the
CGCU’s side - a lot of
our committee having
given up summer to
plan). I’ll start at the very
beginning – which is
usually a very good place
to start. Monday saw me
ad-libbing to some 1400
freshers - a uniquely ter-
rifying experience where I
tried my best not to swear
(again) in front of the
Provost, Ian Walmsley.
Having succeeded and
not committing social
suicide (I think, though
I probably still said too
much), the next big thing
on our plates was the farce
that was the Welcome
Fair. I’d really like to
see ICU’s event plan and
risk assessments for this.
I could bitch for hours
about the ICU’s utter mis-
management of Welcome
Fair - but this isn’t the
place - and it’s only a
matter of time before they
silence me further.
The rest of the ﬁrst
week went by fairly inci-
dent-free, to my knowl-
edge. On the whole it has
been fairly peaceful, with
pleasantly few emails to
send to the Union, or to
have sent to me… I guess
that life can be pretty
good when the Union tell
their volunteers to stop
emailing them!
For those of you who
remember the eight En-
gineering Welcome Talks
we delivered, we hope
they weren’t as dull as the
material that followed.
For those who skipped, I
congratulate you for using
your freedom wisely - just
remember to cook, stay
hydrated and sleep eight
hours a night.
In other Guilds-related
news, we’re copying the
RCSU and hosting a pub
crawl next week - not that
we’re overly endorsing
drinking to excess. We
also had our mascots
stolen on the Monday
of the second week by
the RCSU, only to steal
the RSM’s Davy lamp
on Tuesday whilst their
President was in Union
Council. I’m also person-
ally saddened by the new
green ‘Lloyds’ advertise-
ments in FiveSixEight - is
there nothing the Union
won’t sponsor these days?
Overall though, as I
said, a great ﬁrst couple
of lies that is Imperial;
the non-virgin chemical
engineer, who has to
choose between
ethical divestment and
actually having a job; the
committee member over-
worked and overstressed
but happy with positive
results.
A moment of silence
for those poor newbies
though – I’ve already
seen the plethora of IC
Exposed posts about
sharking and lanyards.
My advice (which is not
the ofﬁcial advice of the
Union) is this: have a
good life. Go out. Have
fun. Be young. But be re-
sponsible. The thing that
amazes me the most about
the incoming year is that
few of you drink, and in
typical Imperial fashion
ﬁnd social situations difﬁ-
cult. Bless. Take the time
to come out of your shells,
and remember you’re here
to grow into well rounded
citizens of the world.
For returning students,
I hope you’re not falling
back on Panopto yet (in
error I have committed to
this for 90% of the ﬁrst
week’s lectures - hopeful-
ly I’ll have actually gone
to some in the second).
And don’t worry - as one
of my profs said “the
good news is you’ve got
through years 1 and 2 and
only have 3 and 4 left”.
I guess the counterpoint
was “the bad news is
you’ve got through years
1 and 2 and still have 3
and 4 left”.
Having wrapped up
my thoughts and anything
of value (of which there
was little) for this week,
I look forward to getting
some genuinely relevant
and constructive content
in the coming weeks.
Freshers’ fortnight has
been a big learning curve,
and I’ve learned a lot
to take forward into the
future if I get the chance.
As an endnote: enjoy
your weekends. I feel
lost when they occur.
Take a break, and as my
ﬂatmate’s phone spits
out at him every so often:
“remember to breathe”.

B
y the time you
get to read this,
it will be the end
ofyourFreshers’
Fortnight. You’ll have
been in College some 2
weeks, and probably have
lost the will to live. Well
fucking done for getting
through it, welcome to the
rest of your terrible life
here.
Admittedly, I did sit
down to write this at
20:10 on Sunday - with it
feeling much like 02:00
– while preparing to get
those creative writing
juices ﬂowing with a
large glass of Aldi’s most
BTEC Port. Clearing a

of weeks. Our clubs seem
to be doing pretty well.
Shout-out to DroneSoc
(who are hosting D.I.Fly
events in late October
and early November) and
Motor Club, who have
gained lots of members
this year. It’s been most
enjoyable to engage
with faces both new and
old: the fresher full of
cosmic potential, who
gets trapped in the web

beginning.
