Poll Results
Question 1: As can be seen on the chart Nintendo is the clear winner, terrifyingly I’ve heard rumours of some student’s having a Wii as their first console - another
reminder of my dying youth. Of course, Sony would take second place knowing their mass success in the production of the PS2 console. Sadly the age of Sega and Atari
are long gone :(
Question 2: To no surprise, many showed similar disdain to the fact that video game movies continue to be absolute trash bar the new Tomb Raider film, which was so
far from the source material that it can be easily passed off as a generic action film.
Question 3: With many great answers, some of the ones that hit us right in the vintage were the Legendary Lego Star Wars, Need for Speed Underground 2, and of
course nominations of Pokemon filled the inbox. Some other less heard of games that struck our interest being: Colin Mcrae Rally 04, Perfect Dark, Harry Potter 1- which
terrifying character models, I’m looking at you Hagrid!
