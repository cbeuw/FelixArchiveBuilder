T
here have been
reports that
Prince Andrew,
The Duke of
York, will be visiting
Imperial’s White City
campus on the 14th of
October. The visit is in
tandem with the ‘Pitch@
Palace' entrepreneurship
scheme that the Duke
began in 2014, the penul-
timate ‘Boot Camp’ stage
of which is being hosted
on the Imperial campus.
The decision of the
College to host the Duke
is considered controver-
sial by some due to the
ongoing investigation into
his friendship with Jeffrey
Epstein. Epstein was
arrested in the US earlier
this year on charges of
sex trafficking underage
women, and had previ-
ously received jail time
of soliciting minors for
prostitution – though he
avoided full scrutiny then
with a secret plea deal.
Over the years, dozens
of women came forward
to press charges. Epstein
later died in his jail cell,
apparently of suicide.
The Duke first met
Epstein in 1999, but main-
tained contact with him
for many years afterwards
– including after Epstein
was released from his first
round of prison – which
the Duke later described as
“a mistake and an error”.
The Duke is known to
have stayed at several of
Epstein’s properties, and
was photographed with
Epstein in 2010 after he
was released – as well as
reportedly appearing nu-
merous times on the logs
of Epstein’s private jet.
Subsequently, the Duke
himself was directly
accused of abusing a
minor, when Virginia
Guiffre stepped forward
and claimed that she was
forced into having sex
with the Duke three times
when she was 17 after
allegedly being recruited
by Epstein as a child sex
slave. The Duke was pho-
tographed with Virginia,
reportedly in 2001, in a
now-infamous photo.
Given the allegations,
visits from the Duke to
other universities during
the Pitch@Palace tour
have received public crit-
icism. Notably, his visit
to the University of South
Wales was described as
“alarming” by the head
of Plaid Cymru, Leanne
Wood, who subsequently
even sought to pressure
Welsh universities via
government into commit-
ting not to host “guests in
this unsavoury situation”.
Regarding the event at
Imperial, the concern is
primarily that the College
is prioritising entrepre-
neurial ties and the benefit
of startup organisations
over the welfare of young-
women. Many incoming
students, having just
joined the College, are
only 17 – the same age as
Virginia Guiffre when she
was allegedly abused by
the Duke. In other words,
it “sends a very negative
message to young women
at the College”, as one
anonymous commentator
said.
The College’s state-
ment does little to assuage
the fears of those who are
concerned. In response to
a request for statement,
a College spokesperson
speaking to Felix said:
“Inspiring and supporting
entrepreneurship is a
priority for Imperial and
we promote a range of
opportunities to help our
students and others to
pursue their enterprising
ideas. This is the driving
force behind our decision
to host Pitch@Palace
Bootcamp 12.0.” There
was no mention of any
consideration for students
who may feel marginal-
ised by the College’s de-
cision, despite a specific
request for clarification
on that issue – only an
acknowledgement that
it would be “inappro-
priate” for the College
to comment, and that
any external event at the
College needs to adhere
to a “code of conduct to
ensure a safe and inclusive
environment.”
Shree Thirumalaiku-
mar, the Chair of the Fem-
inist Society at Imperial,
appears to disagree. She
thinks that this decision
promotes the opposite of
an inclusive environment:
“It feels wrong for
Imperial to host Prince
Andrewinthefaceofthese
unresolved allegations.
In a culture which tends
not to believe in women,
it is hard not to view
College’s decision to run
the event as a disregard of
these accusations entirely
- especially for an insti-
tution that is both of such
size and stature, and that
is home to a large group
of young people.”
The rest of the College
statement addresses the
fact that Imperial startups
that have gone on to win
the event and gain “further
investment” – and of how
the College’s competence
in hosting the event
previously led them to be
offered the chance to host
it again. This agreement
was in fact made in May
– which was after the al-
legations against the Duke
had already emerged.
It is important to note
that there is no formal
relationship between
the College and Pitch@
Palace. Agreements to
host events are made
on a one-off basis, and
the College receives no entrepreneurs and innova-
tion community.”
The Royal Household’s
press office responded
with a refusal to comment
when contacted.
The Duke of York has
also not officially declared
that he will be attending,
though it is assumed
based on his attendance
at the other Pitch@Palace
events on this round. His
official Royal Engage-
ments page remains com-
pletely empty over the
next month. This is also
the reason given by the
College for the lack of any
publicity about the royal
visit: “we would not or-
dinarily promote notable
visits ahead of time. An-
nouncements about Royal
visits are a matter for the
Royal Household.”
Felix will be gauging
student reactions to the
news of the Duke’s visit
over the coming week.

The Duke of York is likely attending the College as part of the Pitch@Palace initiative, with which Imperial has
been involved for several years - but the decision is now controversial after the allegations earlier this year

Despite that, the sense
that there are intangible
benefits is clear from the
spokesperson: “hosting
