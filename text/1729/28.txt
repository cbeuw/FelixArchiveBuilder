Joker
Joaquin Phoenix shines in Todd Phillip’s take on the Clown Prince of Crime’s Origin Story
J
oker opens incredi-
bly well. Lawrence
Sher’s cinematog-
raphy only adds to
an already stunning per-
formance from Joaquin
Phoenix, while both are
elevated by the original
score. Robert De Niro’s
inclusion as a late night
talk show host adds even
more credulity to the
whole endeavour. But
unfortunately, Joker falls
flat. The main source of
tension for the majority of
the films 2 hour runtime
was my worry that every
bloke who sneaked out to
the toilets would return
with an AR-15.
“Unfortunately
Joker falls flat”
million. Because of this,
Phillips is forced to keep
the scale of the film small,
which at times feels at
odds with the character
we expect to see; despite
this, Phoenix carries.
A refreshing take
on the Joker’s origin
story was necessary to
escape the shadow cast
by Heath Ledger’s 2008
performance, but Joker
falls short in its execution.
Phillips’ homage to Taxi
Driver in theme, setting
and scene only serves
to add to this shadow, as
the borrowed imagery
of 1970s New York just
reminds me of a better
version of this plotline.
But despite running 8
minutes longer than Taxi
Driver, it manages to
accomplish much less.
In spite of this, diehard
Batman fans will love
this film. Phillips is true
to the source material
while reviving the lore
of the Joker in a way that
feels fresh and new. Had
Phillips not managed this,
the character may have
finally reached its natural
conclusion on screen.
God forbid. Phoenix’s
performance manages to
elevate some incredibly
average dialogue, and
fans will love his take on
the transformation that
Arthur Fleck undergoes.

JOKER
Gratuitous violence,
unsettling dancing, and
humourless laughter all
create an uncomforta-
ble atmosphere that is
sustained from the films
sluggish beginning until
its thrilling final act. But
Joker suffers from its
relatively small budget
of only $60 million. For
some sense of scale, The
Lego Batman cost $80
