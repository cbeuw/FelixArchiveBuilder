Pride and Expectations
his week, you
are the Felix
Editor – and
you’ve been
caught by your own
hubris!
Last week’s issue was a
standout – I genuinely felt
our content was spectacu-
lar and, for the most part,
our copy was up to par
(excluding the butchery of
a few unfortunate .pngs,
God rest my soul for the
sins I have committed
against this poor file
format). New members
are settling into the team,
have largely been trained,
and a few of them have
even been fully integrated
into our cult and joined the
weekly Felix drinks. Oh,
sorry, I meant “society”,
not cult. Be sure to sign
up to Felix for free on the
Union site, kids.
In fact, a few people
offered me the highest
praise they know how
to give: “this could have
come out in Fred’s year.”
To some of you that
won’t mean much – for
context, Fred Fyles was
Editor two years ago and
is considered by those
people praising the issue
to be little less than super-
human. Living up to that
type of legacy at Felix
was one thing that both
excited and unnerved me
when deciding whether
to run for the Editor role;
it’s nice to have somewhat
reached it in week two.
On the other hand,
it would also be nice
to escape that shadow.
There is a slight fear that
everything I do this year
will only be considered
relative to how it has
been done before, when
I’m most passionate
about the new things I’m
introducing – both in the
paper and behind-the-
scenes.
This is something I
suspect many Imperial
students can relate to.
We are all thrown into
one of the hardest degree
courses in the world, and
expected to match up to
very high standards – a
legacy left by great names
come before us, and that
one guy in the year above
who never revises but
somehow still comes out
with 93% in every effing
exam. Especially those
of us who want to go
into academics know that
to succeed we not only
have to match, but rather
outdo the clever clogs
who have preceded us. It’s
infuriating and inspiring
in equal measure, a chal-
lenge to both our pride
and our insecurity – traits
I think most of us have
in abundance, openly or
otherwise.
Personally I think that,
collectively, we need to
give ourselves a damn
break – and remember
that there will always be
a path to where we want
to be, even if we don’t
succeed at every stage.
Let me be a lesson: I
screwed my degree up, as
the Physics Senior Tutor
will surely attest, but was
fortunate enough to find I
love writing (as you can
tell by this meandering
mess of an Editorial) and
to land a great job doing
that. There’s always a
path.
Unfortunately, this phi-
losophy of giving oneself
a break needs to be tem-
pered by an understanding
of when it is appropriate
to do so. Back to my
hubris. Let this be another
lesson – in what not to do,
this time.
Last week turning
out very well led me to
allow myself a whole two
days off in a row, after
working something like
a combined 140 hours in
the previous two weeks –
including a nice 37-hour
shift over last Wednesday
and Thursday.
In the words of the
fabulous Eddie Izzard:
“Oh, stupid man.” (If you
haven’t seen Dress to Kill,
stop reading this nonsense
and watch it immediately.)
I was not prepared.
The nature of Felix
is that one has to be a
firefighter, fixing all the
small things that pop up
at the last minute. Do not
get me wrong – this is the
most satisfied and driven
I’ve felt in years, but there
are also a lot of things
that aren’t delving into
investigations, but rather
managing relationships
or (most dreaded of all)
admin.
My complacency
meant that the flames
stoked higher without
anybody to notice, and
we very nearly got burned
this week. The inflamed
images of the first issue’s
copy problems, scorched
into my retinas, floated
before my eyes.
Once again, I am
inclined to believe this is
a highly relatable feeling
at university – although
perhaps that’s just the
latent scruffy, disorgan-
ised teenager that lurks
in my cold mid-20s heart
shining through a bit.
I’m writing this on
Wednesday evening –
and things are burning a
little bit. Consider this a
metaphorical cry for help.
So all I can hope is that
everything worked out
okay, and I can pretend
that none of it ever
happened. Perhaps after
another 37-hour shift (oh,
yay).
I’ll just walk out of the
office on Thursday night,
whistling nonchalantly in
that way that lets every-
body know you’re trying
to be inconspicuous and
thus failing in that task
miserably, at 3am long
after the print deadline
has passed and poor Beit
freshers are stumbling
from the Union into their
conveniently located beds.
You can pull anything off
if you just commit hard
enough, whether that’s
the violently neon catsuit
your mates convinced you
to parade around Metric
or a passion project you
just scraped in on time!

Another week,
another issue,
another rant - this
time on hubris,
expectations, and
how they can
burn you!
