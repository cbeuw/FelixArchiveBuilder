Binge of the Week: Killing Eve (Seasons 1 and 2)
A thrilling mouse-and-cat tale told with unbelievable charm and wit
“ What draws

B
BC America’s
spring spy
thriller Killing
Eve takes a
unique twist on a tradi-
tionally masculine genre,
featuring a rather atypical
tale of mutual obsession
between a British intel-
ligence investigator, Eve
Polastri (Sandra Oh) and
a sociopathic assassin
named Villanelle (Jodie
Comer). Critically ac-
claimed for its production
as well as the acting, the
show has been nominated
and received awards in-
cluding Primetime Emmy,
Golden Globe, Screen
Actors Guild Award, just
to name a few.
Originally based on
Luke Jennings’s Villanelle
novels and produced by
writer Phoebe Waller-
Bridge known for her
performance and writing
in the play-turned-series
Fleabag, Killing Eve was
meant to be extraordinary
from the very beginning.
Effortlessly blending
thrilling action sequences
with dark humour, Waller-
Bridge manages to bring
out the absurd and the
comical even in life-and-
death situations, which
sets a terrifying yet witty
tone for the show through
the psychopathic yet well-
loved protagonists.
As a character-driven
piece, the plot of Killing
Eve moves rather slowly.
However, it still features
typical elements of
suspense that keep the
audience hooked, like an
underground organisation
operating with spies
rooted deep in the govern-
ment, untold conspiracies,
and plot twists. But what
sets it apart is its unique
characters breaking tra-
ditional molds. Villanelle
is ostentatious and out-
landish - not the kind of
killer who hides behind
the shades or shoots from
a distance. Her kills are
messy and almost always
unexpectedly theatrical.
Eve Polastri relies not on
her intelligence or logic
to hunt down Villanelle;
instead, she is gifted and
instinctive and spontane-
ous. What it lacks in its
slow-paced plot Killing
Eve certainly makes it
up with the dynamics
between the characters.
The superb acting un-
doubtedly brings the show
to life. Oh, well known
for her previously starring
in Grey’s Anatomy as Dr.
Cristina Yang, takes on
the role of Eve Polastri.
At the start of the show,
everything in Eve’s life is
going fine. Her husband
is fine; her job is fine; her
friends are fine. There is a
little more out there that
she yearns for beyond her
boring MI5 office job.
The sudden appearance of
Villanelle acts as a switch
that flips her world upside
down, pushing her to her
limits as she drifts further
away from everything
she ever has as the story
progresses. Through her
superb acting, Sandra
Oh manages to have the
audience rooting for Eve.
The way Oh delivers her
role evokes emotions and
makes everything implau-
sible so believable.
The role of Villanelle
is a complex one. The
team even consulted a
psychologist specialised
in female psychopaths in
order to build as much
of a three-dimensional
character as possible. Her
difficult upbringing even-
tually results in her psy-
chopathic tendencies, yet
she shines through with
her confidence and charm
and childlike personality.
There is a balance between
her humor and innocence
and indifference towards
death, and Jodie Comer
captures that perfectly
like a child who happens
to love to kill. “How do
you make people care
about psychopaths is a
question that kept coming
up early on,” said show
producer Waller-Bridge,
“And the answer is, cast
Jodie Comer.”
What draws the atten-
tion of many besides the
enthralling premise and
sapphic chemistry is the
meticulous set design.
Every scene was shot in
the actual place where it’s
set, from kills in Tuscany
to a prison in Moscow
to Gare du Nord station
in Paris. This extent of
commitment definitely
pays off as each location
has its irreplaceable depth
and flavour. The creative
crew steered away from
iconic landmarks and
instead searched for the
hidden corners of each
city, casually juxtaposing
a ruthless assassin in
everyday streets -- we
could all just be right next
to a psychopath. Despite
the diverse filming loca-
tions, the series maintains
a coherent palette with its
distinctive cinematogra-
phy.
The set design is yet
another detail worth
applauding given how
it creates the starkly
contrasting atmospheres
between the two main
characters. Villanelle’s
gorgeous flat in Paris
feels like the home of
any twenty-year-old
Parisian woman, chic and
aesthetically pleasing,
intertwined with mur-
derous spins -- guns in a
beautiful chest of drawers,
poison mixed in perfume,
a jeweled hairpin where
the razor-sharp edge
serves as a weapon. On
one end of the spectrum
is Villanelle’s cold-blood-
edly charming lone wolf’s
den, and on the other end
is Eve’s comforting and
cozy home, with warm
lights with yellowish tints,
leftover Shepherd’s pie

“Villanelle is
ostentatious
and outland-
ish - not the
kind who hides
behind the
shades”
“Casually
juxtaposing
a ruthless
assassin in
everyday
streets”
in the fridge and undone
laundry in the hamper.
Serving a similar role
is the costume design of
Killing Eve. Breaking
away from the stereotypi-
cal leather suits and cargo
pants, Villanelle’s closet
stars designer blazers and
bubblegum pink dresses
and runway gowns. Every
outfit choice of Villanelle
“Designer
blazers and
bubblegum
pink dresses
and runway
gowns”
is simply a statement
on wits own. She stands
out to blend in, and her
wardrobe crafts the perfect
image of a captivatingly
chic chameleon. Or as
Steff Yodka of Vogue puts
it, “Killing Eve is the most
fashionable show on TV.”
The first two seasons
of Killing Eve have many
pieces of the puzzle in the
right place -- the cast, the
crew, the production. The
third season is currently
in production aiming for
a release in the spring
of 2020. With Suzanne
Heathcote taking over the
writing, I look forward to
seeing how she resolves
the season finale’s cliff-
hanger and hope to see
more action and plot de-
velopment incorporated.
