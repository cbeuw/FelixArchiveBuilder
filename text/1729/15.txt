Me too in Mount Olympus
J
acques Offenbach
composed his
world-famous op-
eretta Orphée aux
enfers in late 19th century
France, satirizing the soci-
ety of his time, the ruling
classes and their vices.
Now, in the second opera
of this season’s ENO’s
Orpheus Series, director
Emma Rice adapts this
comic masterpiece to our
times, bringing current
topics to the mythological
world.Itisn’tthatdifferent
from the original - human
nature hasn’t changed
that much. Instead, Rice
changes the point of view,
adding depth to our per-
ception of the characters’
complex inner lives.
In Offenbach’s version,
Orpheus hates his wife
and constantly says so,
embarking on a rescue
mission just because
Public Opinion (yes, that’s
a character) compels him
to. Apparently that was
funny at the time… Rice
adds a backstory during
the orchestral overture
and shifts the narrative
to that of a couple broken
by tragedy in a path to
forgiveness and reunion,
restoring Orpheus (played
by Ed Lyon) to his tradi-
tional role of a romantic
hero. Public Opinion (por-
trayed by Lucia Lucas) is
still there, helping him
and driving/flying an
actual black London cab.
Other significant changes
are that Eurydice (played
by Mary Bevan) is now a
victim of the abuse of the
gods who take advantage
of her trauma, instead of
a mere prop being tossed
around; and Jupiter (por-
trayed by Willard White)
is a powerful bastard
who always gets away
with sexual assault and is
despised by every other
god. Bevan deserves a
shout out for her first-rate
singing and clear, bright
voice. It really makes
us sympathise with the
character, all the way
from the discussions with
her husband to the frenzy
dance of the final act.
The show has a
lukewarm start, with a
lengthy spoken intro-
duction that delays the
start of the music, but
rapidly warms up with a
ridiculously funny chorus
of sheep and bees. Pluto
(played by Alex Otter-
burn), a very good flirt
with a terrible evil laugh,
seduces a despair-driven
Eurydice and tricks
Orpheus into killing her.
The scene then changes
to Mount Olympus, a
luxurious white-tilled
vacation complex, and
from then on it’s strong,
quality fun until the end.
We see the gods accusing
Jupiter of being an incor-
rigible sexual predator,
condemning his actions
because ‘love is only
lovely when the loved
one agrees’. The topic of
abuse recurs, with the god
of gods turning into a fly
to seduce Eurydice in a hi-
larious scene whose great
protagonist is someone
waving a stick with a giant
“fly” at the tip. Then she
is assaulted by John Styx
(portrayed by Alan Oke),
Bacchus and Pluto again.
It is definitely not fun to
be Eurydice in this story.
Originally in French,
the libretto was freely
translated to English
for this production. The
best thing about it is that
it allows itself enough
creative freedom to bring
humour that suits the
modern taste, without
drifting from the main
topics. It is also incredibly
witty, and many a time
did the audience laugh out
loud. It isn’t every day that
you hear someone singing
‘Shit, he’s coming’ in an
extremely operatic voice.
The dance numbers are
also incredibly energetic,
and at times touching
upon the ridiculous,
in a parody to excess.
Colourful sets and a very
active chorus add extra
layers of action to the
stage. A particularly good
example is the final of act
two: the clouds are made
of giant balloons, people
wear balloon tutus and the
lights alternate between
all primary colours. All in
an exuberant celebration
of the decision that the
gods ‘are going to follow
god [Jupiter] to hell.’ It
can only be a good idea
because, as they put it, the
secret to a good life is to
‘chose a good leader and
follow them everywhere’.
The climactic scene of
the final, that Offenbach
called “galop infernal”
but is known as the music
for the cabaret dance
“can-can”, hits just the
right amount of tragedy
and sordid appeal. Set in a
horrendous peep show in
the underworld, there is a
stark contrast between the
glamour of the costumes
and Eurydice’s terrible
words, all observed at a
distance by keen males
with binoculars. Fated to
remain in the Underworld
serving Bacchus, her only
alternative is to ‘embrace
the frenzy and the pain
until the mad becomes the
sane’.
With catchy tunes,
stunning sets and great
performances, Orpheus in
the Underworld promises
to become a great night
out - funny, appealing and
deeply rooted in today’s
world.
Orpheus in the Underworld is a hilarious account of bored gods abusing the mortal world
