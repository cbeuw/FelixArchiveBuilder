Now is the Time to Say Nothing
W
hat to say
for Now is
the Time
to Say
Nothing? Now is the
Time..., is primarily a
piece of artwork about
relationships. Although
there is a focus on the
relationship between
one group of Western
teenagers and a Syrian
artist-turned-refugee, it
forces the audience to
confront their relationship
with the terrible images
that haunt our television
screens every time there is
a news bulletin concern-
ing conflict. It encourages
the viewer to look past the
pornography of suffering,
explosions and death, and
put oneself in the position
of someone enduring
the sheer brutality of
the Syrian civil war. As
opposed to abstraction
and passivity, it aims to
generate empathy.
The artwork was
located in an intimate
setting, with a small
audience of ten or so
people. Each member of
the audience was given
a pair of headphones, an
armchair and an old-fash-
ioned television set,
through which footage
was played. I am sure this
was intended to simulate
the isolation in which
we experience the news,
although of course in this
day and age, we are far
more likely to be reading
about the conflict hunched
over a smartphone on
the tube than in a genteel
living room.
I found several other
stylisticchoicesalsorather
odd. In order to simulate
snowfall, for example,
a fan gently sprinkled
small bits of paper around
the room. Removing the
paper from my hair after-
wards was frustrating, and
the sheer unnecessariness
of it further annoyed me.
The brief attempts at pro-
fundity, speculating about
static on the television as
remnants of the Big Bang
also wound me up as more
unnecessary additions.
The concept of how we
engage with modern con-
flicts through the medium
of news is surely profound
enough without adding
Bryan Cox into the mix.
The area where the
art succeeded most of all
was the footage. I don’t
think I’ll be able to forget
the video of one of the
artist’s relatives breaking
down during the conflict.
Reem Karssli is masterful
with a camera. I also
thought that instructing
audience members to
cluster cross-legged
claustrophobically close
to one another on the floor
to simulate a sea crossing
in a small boat was rather
interesting. However,
this technique did rather
depend on effective
audience participation,
something that could
not be relied on as two
members of the audience
ignored the instructions
and just did their own
thing.
Overall I think, as a
piece of art, it is mediocre
at best but the message
that it is sending is hugely
important. As opposed to
the version of conflict we
are used to, a war reporter
with a flak jacket standing
in the wreckage of a
school next to a bearded
man in battle dress
clutching a Kalashnikov,
breathlessly wanking
himself off about how
close to the frontlines he
is, Now is the Time to Say
Nothing provides an al-
ternate vision. That of the
civilian, forced to relocate
due to a brutal conflict.
Although not brilliantly
executed, this remains an
important piece of art.
Interview with the makers of Now is the Time to Say
Nothing
Would you mind
briefly summarising
your stories?
Caroline Williams: This
is the story of Syrian artist
Reem Karssli’s life during
the Syrian conflict. It follows
the story of what happens
when a group of teenagers
from London tries to contact
her. It is about how we can
stay connected to the people
we love when war and the
need for survival gets in the
way.
What would you like
people to take away
from the art?
CW: That real people exist
at the centre of these huge
conflicts and that those peo-
ple matter.
Why did you choose
to make the experi-
ence individual?
CW: It begins as an indi-
vidual experience so that it
can then become a commu-
nal one. The piece is about
connecting so it makes sense
that it would go from an iso-
lated individual experience
to a group experience.
Do you think this
medium (of film) is
the main way people
consume news media
now? Did you consid-
er using other medi-
ums in conjunction
with film?
CW: Obviously social media
is a big part of how news is
consumed now. We did con-
sider it but you can’t make
work about everything!
Would you be able to
point to an inspira-
tion for your work?
CW: Adam Curtis and of
course the main inspiration
is Reem Karssli’s Every Day
Every Day.
In your article [Car-
oline WIlliam’s Run
Riot piece] you men-
tion the protests in
Egypt as being a spur
to begin this project.
Do you think that the
events in the Middle
East receive enough
coverage?
CW: It depends where you
look. Obviously different
news outlets have different
focus. I think we all know
that conflicts can fall in and
out of the news based on a
narrative and politically mo-
tivated appetite for what’s
happening.
Do you think that
the events receive
enough of the right
coverage? What do
you feel are the main
differences between
the narrative you are
telling and the nar-
rative you see in the
mainstream media?
CW: Ours is a personal
narrative. Not only are the
storytelling tools we are us-
ing different (sound, light,
touch) from mainstream me-
dia but the content doesn’t
have to fit a news room spec.
We are focusing on the stuff
of the everyday - the tedium
and real slow creeping grief
of war.
Do you think that it is
possible for a West-
ern audience to truly
empathise with the
situation in Syria?
CW: No. But I think they
can stay open and put them-
selves in a space to try and
empathise.
How did you choose
the young people
that took part in this
project?
CW: I auditioned them and
chose the ones who didn’t
look bored when I spoke
about politics.
Why did you choose
young people and
not a broad spec-
trum of ages?
CW: Young people have
an amazing way of asking
the difficult questions that
adults are afraid to ask.
What impact would
you say you have had
on the young people
that are part of the
project?
CW: I hope it’s shown them
they can make art and that
people will want to engage
with it. I hope I’ve also
shown them that what they
think and how they think
matters.
