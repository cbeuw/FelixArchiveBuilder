IC Fishing Society finds affordable fishing in London
O
kay now you’ve
taken the bait.
There is no
Imperial fishing
society, but I do recom-
mend starting a society if
enough of you are inter-
ested. Also I am gill-ty of
not technically fishing in
London, it was Epping,
but Central line does go
there! Affordability is also
questionable, £40 for a
full day fishing rainbow
trout, being able to take
two fish home, and equip-
ment hire is pretty damn
steep. Thankfully this was
a birthday treat and for me
it was free.
In my younger years
I was a keen watcher of
River Monsters and ever
since watching Jeremy
Wade wrestle beasts from
the deep, I’ve wanted to
try my hand at fishing.
As well as the thrill of
the catch, the aspect of
chilling on the bank with a
brewski is very appealing.
So last Saturday six of
us headed to Thornwood
extremely helpful. We
were given our fly fishing
rods, nets and priest (a
bat for killing fish), and
off we went! Only two
members of the group
having fished before, and
no one having fly fished.
With our combined vast
experience we did not
decide to buy the instruc-
tor package whereby Peter
would have helped us.
Peter having noticed our
perplexed looks kindly
gave us a small tutorial on
fly fishing. Unfortunately
our incompetence knows
no bounds and on being
set loose on the lake we
began having problems.
Peter was great about it,
detangling, reattaching
floats, re-tying lines. He
wasn’t upset or annoyed,
but disappointed. Like a
father figure we tried to
gain approval by quickly
improving our fishing
technique, and our first
couple hours of fishing
were fortuitous; six fish
were caught! Steve’s
guidance was trout-lessly
helped us, but as the
day cooled the fished
stopped nibbling and we
ended up with only ten
before heading home and
cooking.
The act of fishing is
not only fun, but relaxing,
exciting and somewhat
therapeutic. When a fish
bites and you first feel
it thrashing away it is
exhilarating, yanking the
rod, keeping tension on
the line and pulling the
unfortunate lil bugger in
is thrilling. Chilling on
the bank keeping an eye
on the float is suspense-
ful, and it does require
patience. Sitting on the
bank with my besties,
sipping brewskies, and
the sunset in the beyond
the M25 wildlands was
a lovely experience. I
will be sure to go fishing
again!
