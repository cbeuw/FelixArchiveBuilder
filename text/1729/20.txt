Fresh tracks!
L
apalux laid the
foundation of his
discography on
glitchy, rough,
and voided ambient
sounds. While not con-
sidered “experimental”,
his style certainly didn’t
draw in the more main-
stream crowds. However,
his most recent release
demonstrates a calmer and
more collected direction.
This track is supposed
to be “a sort of portman-
teau of the amniotic sac
and the universe”. With
rapid deep house drums,
ethereal flowing chorus
and warping synths the
achieved sound is a perfect
balance between calming
and energising. - GR
P
YJÆN is yet an-
other fruit of the
primordial soup
that is London’s
Jazz scene, a five-piece
(Trumpet, Sax, Guitar,
Drums, Bass) most nota-
bly featuring Dylan Jones
(of the Ezra Collective).
‘In Search of the Sicky
Side’is the closing track of
their debut and self-titled
album. It’s hook alone is
gorgeous, slippery bass, a
punchy psychedelic guitar
riff, topped off with a
gorgeous melody bursting
with sweet harmonies.
Solos from guitar and
trumpet stand out, par-
ticularly Jones’ agile
rhythms. In the track’s
final minutes it builds into
a cathartic 3-time break-
down, guitars and trumpet
bathed in delay – finding
a sweet-spot somewhere
between cool jazz serenity
and post-rock ecstasy, ‘In
Search of the Sticky side’
is well worth a listen.

Get to know the editors! A continuation...
M
y first gig
at the age
of two was
Radiohead
supported by Supergrass,
and I’d like to say that
was the start of my music
journey, but I was still lap-
ping up Now That’s What
I Call Music albums 10
years later. My first foray
into the alternative side of
things started with Oasis,
which led into QOTSA,
Nirvana and The Smiths
before taking a jump to
classic rock, including
Led Zeppelin, Black
Sabbath, the Sex Pistols
and David Bowie amongst
many, many others.
H
i, I’m Miles,
my first concert
was JLS, I
have a GCSE
in David Bowie and yes,
that was me belting the
smiths at union Karaoke.
I spent my teenage years
listening to classic rock
and indie, so I know my
Brian Eno from my Brian
Jonestown massacre, my
T-rex from my Dinosaur
Jr and my Elvis Costello
from my Elvis Presley.
Since starting at
Imperial I’ve branched
out, delving into electron-
ic, Hip-hop and Jazz old
and new. At the moment,
I’m loving the eclectic
crop of jazz artists London
has been sprouting over
the last decade, as well
as trying to stay afloat on
the tidal wave of hip-hop
that Spotify dumps on me
weekly.
I’m also the bassist
for a local band ‘Uncle
Monty’ (from the cult
flick ‘Withnail & I’),
who you probably didn’t
catch last week at the ill
attended freshers carnival,
those of you lucky enough
to have a ticket for the
CGCU Welcome dinner
will find us providing
entertainment there.

any incredible up-and
coming bands, of which
there are plenty of in
London. Some current
recommendations would
be Girls in Synthesis,
Ladybird and Frauds. You
can thank me for those
later...

Eventually I came back
to the present day and
artists I currently have on
loop include Idles, Slaves,
Pigsx7 and Mac DeMarco.
As an avid gig-goer my
second home is in a mosh
pit while I (desperately)
try to keep an ear out for
