The Need for a Green Rebellion
We are running out
of time
I
n wartime, no one
questions the urgen-
cy of the situation.
Everyday politics is
often put aside, as survival
becomes the only prior-
ity at hand. Cooperation
becomes the focus on
all levels of society;
leaders unite, industries
work towards the most
urgent needs, and citizens
contribute in any way
they can. Society does
not stand by and await
disaster, but acts through
common efforts to avert
it. The question that must
follow is therefore: Why,
in the face of what may
be the greatest threat in
history of mankind, are
we doing nothing?
The threats of climate
change should not be un-
derestimated. The medical
journal The Lancet
recently declared climate
change the “biggest
global health threat of
the 21st century”. They
derived several expected
global health issues from
rising temperatures. Other
than the direct harm of
heat stress, additional
effects include the spread
of certain diseases and
a reduction of people’s
ability to work, particu-
larly in the agricultural
sector. Between 2000
and 2017, the number of
people annually exposed
to heat related risks has
already increased by 157
million. Furthermore,
rising temperatures has
also exacerbated deserti-
fication, which currently
affects 2.7 billion people,
and is expected to cause
up to 700 million migra-
tions by 2050. Another
280 million people, of
which 3.8 million Britons,
are expected to be forced
to leave their homes as a
result of rising sea levels
in the case of a 2°C
temperature increase.
We cannot even begin to
imagine all the disasters
that climate change can
bring, and it should be
clear to everyone that we
are heading towards a
global crisis.
Unfortunately, that
does not seem to be the
case. Earlier this week,
PM Boris Johnson de-
scribed participants of
the ongoing protests as
“uncooperative crusties”,
and brought up Margaret
Thatcher as someone
who “took [greenhouse
gases] seriously long
before Greta Thunberg”.
Ironically, he unintention-
ally pointed straight at
the problem: for 30 years
greenhouse gas emission
has been a recognised
issue, and yet it has not
been dealt with.
In signing the Paris
Agreement in 2015, a
total of 222 nations agreed
to limit global warming to
2°C above pre-industrial
levels, and aiming for
under 1.5°C. Sadly, only
two countries - Morocco
and The Gambia - are on
track to meet the 1.5°C
goal. (It is important to
remember that, whilst a
1.5°C increase would be
much less severe than a
2°C increase, the former
will still have dire con-
sequences.) Because all
other nations are failing
to live up to their pledges,
the world is expected to
surpass 1.5°C already by
2035, with an expected
rise of 3.2°C by the end of
the century. At the current
emission rate, the remain-
ing “CO2 budget” (the
amount of CO2 that can
be emitted whilst main-
taining a 66 % chance of
meeting the 2°C target,
estimated by IPCC) will
be completely exhausted
in 17 years, with only 11
years remaining in order to
stay below 1.5°C. In other
words: we are running out

of time, and nothing is
being done about it.
A better future is
possible
One argument that is
frequently used by oppo-
nents of investments in
sustainable development
is that future technology
will be able to solve any
issues related to climate
change. For all those
people, there are good
news: the future is now!
As a result of recent
advances in wind and
solar power - improved
design, lowered produc-
tion costs, and an increase
of utility-scale operations
- renewable energy has
now become cheaper
than conventional energy
sources. According to
a report released by the
International Renewable
Energy Agency (IRENA)
in May this year, renew-
able energy produced by
wind turbines and pho-
tovoltaics are frequently
cheaper than any fossil
fuel alternative.As renew-
able energy production
costs continue to fall, new
installations are expected
to undercut even the
continuation of existing
coal power plants. Fur-
thermore, advancements
are being made in the
production, storage, and
use of hydrogen fuels,
whilst carbon capture, uti-
lisation, and sequestration
is an active research area
with the emerging market.
Such progress is proof
that necessary sustainable
technologies are - at the
very least - well within
reach, and their devel-
opment does not require
anything more than a
willingness to invest and
adapt. However, the sole
existence of sustainable
technologies will not drive
change. Again and again,
influential individuals
and organisations have
actively worked against
necessary sustainable
developments in favour
of their own short-term
political and financial
benefits. We cannot
tolerate this any longer,
and sustainability must
become as sought after as
economic growth is today.
The need of a global
movement to force
change
The risks and causes
of climate change have
been long known. Had
we acted early enough,
we would not have been
in the urgent situation
that we are in now. But
we are, and we now need
change at an unprece-
dented rate and scale.
Political campaigning has
failed. Corporations still
score short-term benefits
from environmentally
damaging activities.
Traditional activism has
not had the necessary
large-scale impact.
Self-imposed individual
behavioural changes
will never be a realistic
solution to a global
issue. Thankfully, history
provides a solution.
Famous examples such
as Gandhi’s anti-coloni-
alism, Mandela’s fight
against apartheid, and Dr
Martin Luther King’s and
Rosa Parks’ civil rights
movement, all prove the
effectiveness of civil
disobedience and non-vi-
olent direct action. Once a
government starts arrest-
ing thousands of its own
peaceful citizens, it soon
loses its legitimacy. This
is what is needed today: a
global political movement
with widespread support
from people, so immense
that it becomes impossi-
ble for those in power to
ignore.
For this to come true,
people must show their
support for the ongoing
protests. Everyone is
welcome, and everyone
is needed. Support can
be shown simply through
silent agreement, and
more preferably through
participation, or even by
taking one’s own initia-
tives. One may even argue
that, in times of societal
emergency combined with
political inaction, civil
disobedience is a duty of
every citizen.
