Y
ou might’ve
just moved to
London and are
already miss-
ing home and looking for
something to do to help
distract you – be it camp-
ing in the countryside,
or lunch on the seaside,
England has so much to
offer, and London is only
thetipoftheiceberg,Make
the most of your time here
and make it a priority to
see all the beautiful places
that are right at your
doorstep – from gorgeous
coasts, to misty clifftops
and astounding gardens,
prepare yourself for the
staycation of a lifetime.
Leave your passport, grab
your bags, and join Felix
as we take you on our
very own adventure to the
6 most beautiful locations
around the UK.
1. Cambridge
Famous for its universi-
ty, Cambridge is no doubt
one of England’s most
appreciated towns, but its
location means it has so
much more to offer than
a solid education. You can
start off by following a
trail along the whopping
31 colleges around the
university town, and sub-
sequently, pay the River
Cam a visit and punt along
it, whilst you observe the
historic town’s beauty in
all its wonder as you pass
the town centre.
2. Lake District
With its UNESCO
World Heritage status, the
Lake District is unmis-
takably one of the most
scenic on our list. Whether
you’re looking for inspi-
ration to write your next
poem, book, song (or even
dissertation), or you’re
just looking to spend some
downtime away from the
city – look no further.
The natural wonders
around here include 12
beautiful lakes, with Eng-
land’s largest lake – Win-
dermere, as well as one
of the highest mountains
– Scafell Pike – within
walking distance of each
other. So, get ready for
a beautiful trail and the
escapade of a lifetime as
you’re bound to experi-
ence some of the most
tranquil days ever here.
3. Bristol
Voted student city of
the year for years in a row,
Bristol is perfect for when
you want to get away
from the hustle and bustle
of London, but you’re not
quite ready to take on the
stillness that comes with
being in the countryside.
Bristol’s great as that mid-
dle-ground: use the day to
follow contemporary art
and immerse yourself into
Banksy’s work, and then
pop over to the seafront
for some late-afternoon
shopping and a scenic
dinner.
4. Cornwall
TheUK’ssurﬁngcapital
has recently become
more and more popular
following the premier
of Poldark, and we can
deﬁnitely see why. Take
yourself down to St Ives,
one of Cornwall’s most
artsy towns, and browse
through some gorgeous
galleries – including the
classic Tate St Ives. Don’t
forget to follow this up
with a visit to the iconic
Watergate Bay – what
is arguable Cornwall’s
most picturesque beach
– and then pop down to
St. Michael’s Mount – a
mini rocky island with the
legendary cave in which
a giant supposedly lives.
Guess you’re going to
have to ﬁnd out yourself if
this is indeed a myth or a
fact…
5. Brighton
The Brighton Royal
Pavilion is among the
most prevalent attractions
in the UK, and it’s not hard
to see why. This seaside
fortress, initially belong-
ing to Prince George IV,
and contemporarily titled
“the pleasure palace”, is
an Indian-style palace
with nearly 200 years of
history, and an interior
your Instagram feed most
deﬁnitely needs.
6. Bath
One of England’s
oldest cities, Bath is
famous for its Roman
Baths, which reportedly
have healing waters that
have attracted sightseers
from all over the world for
over 1000 years. If you’d
like to experience these
for yourself, head over
to Thermae Vath Spa and
prepare yourself for the
pampering of a lifetime
– perfect for a post-exam
treat, or even just some
time away from the stress
of uni.
