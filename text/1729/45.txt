n an official state-
ment, responding
to criticism of the
people booked for
talks, the Union has
declared themselves per-
plexed. A spokesman told
NegaFelix “We brought
together leading individ-
uals in their fields, all of
whom are ready to impart
knowledge. We find this
response frustrating given
how much work we have
done convincing some of
our speakers to attend.”
The Union has long faced
criticism over its speaker
policy, having booked
lecturers some felt either
weren’t interesting to
students such as Harriet
Nulance an expert on
the use of the space bar
in C++ programming
or weren’t aimed at the
student body such as
MoMo the Clown’s “I got
your nose!” talk which
required a number of
students to seek medical
advice afterwards.
Last year students
lobbied for talks of both
a scientific and non sci-
entific nature in order to
help them develop into
well-rounded individuals.
While the Union initially
acceded to the requests,
promising a comprehen-
sive review into how
guest speakers are chosen,
the release of the schedule
last week showed that the
institution as a whole had
not made any progress.
Seb Fenton, third year
EIE, was conflicted about
the talks. “It isn’t that I’m
not interested. I would
really like to go to a lot of
these talks. It just feels like
slightly poor taste.” When
pressed, he admitted that
Running a Social Media
Campaign by Andrew
Wakefield had caught
his eye. “The guy clearly
knew his stuff,” he added.
Other talks on the list that
have garnered criticism
include Portraying Guilt
by Kevin Spacey, Ad-
vanced Human Anatomy
by Burke and Hare, The
Importance and Value of
Scouting for Boys and
Girls by Jimmy Saville
and finally from our own
Chancellor, Living with
Hooves by Alice Ghast.
