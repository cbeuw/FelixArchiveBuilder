The Farewell
This exceptionally charming film serves as both a conduit with which to showcase Awkwafina’s expanding talent,
as well as a moving portrayal of a disconnected family uniting under tragic circumstances; Lulu Wang’s second
feature proves she’s a director to watch out for.
Y
ou’d be for-
given for not
having heard
the name Lulu
Wang before Sundance
2019, but after making a
big splash this year with
The Farewell, her name
should be at the top of
directors we can be sure
to expect more of in the
future.
Based on Wang’s
own experience, The
Farewell follows Billi
(Awkwafina), an aspiring
American-Chinese writer
who returns to China after
being informed her family
have received a terminal
diagnosis for her grand-
mother (Zhao Shuzhen),
yet are collectively with-
holding this information
from her. Under the guise
of a fabricated wedding
between Billi’s cousin
and his fiancé, the whole
family unites in Chang-
chun to spend some final
time with Nai-Nai as a
family.
Depending on who you
ask, family gatherings
can either be a hellish or
a joyous occasion, yet for
this expertly written story
Wang has managed to
weave in both scenarios,
creating a beautifully
bittersweet film in the
process.
At the helm of this
ensemble is Awkwafina,
who’s character Billi,
seems to be caught in
a cultural tug-of-war
between Eastern vs
Western culture. Raised in
America, the dissonance
in her ‘western views’
compared to her Eastern
heritage provides an
emotional minefield for
her to walk through, as
she struggles to connect
her childhood memories
to the everchanging
landscape around her.
The family all see her as
“Family
gatherings
can either
be a hellish
or joyous
occasion ”
“The
dissonance in
her‘western
views’with
her Eastern
heritage
creates a
minefield”
the successful product of
American life, yet early
in the film we see she’s
struggling financially and
is unsuccessful in her
writing career (which she
chooses to keep hidden).
This burden of expecta-
tion and hidden self is a
common theme through-
out all the main characters
in the film. Each character
is hiding a huge piece of
information from the ma-
triarch of the family and
this leads each character
to play a fictitious version
of themselves. This is
heavily visualised through
the brilliant cinematog-
raphy of Anna Franquesa
Solano, who expertly
frames each scene to
give a very intimate and
accessible feel to the
picture. The isolated
shots of characters as
a juxtaposition against
many of the wider-angle
shots involving the whole
ensemble emphasise the
disconnected family, who
can at times feel like a
group of strangers. The
colours used in the film,
from wedding photos to
the streets of Changchun,
all seem to be so fitting of
the moment used. Neither
extravagant nor forced,
they give a feeling that
is very intimate, making
it more immersive and
down to earth; this is not
a film that tries too hard to
be attractive yet in doing
so becomes very visually
pleasing.
However, I don’t want
you going away thinking
this is exclusively a heart
wrenching film; due to
the brilliantly written
script and the absurd im-
promptu wedding that’s
being thrown, there is
an overarching comedic
theme. There’s this one
bit of information that we
all know, this little secret
that the audience is in on,
yet Nai-Nai is unaware.
The whole crazy scenario
makes for some brilliant
moments, with Zhao
Shuzhen delivering some
real zingers throughout.
The fact that it also plays
as a comedy is testament
to the brilliant writing
and direction of Wang, to
have a comedy under the
pretence that someone is
dying, whilst also making
it heartfelt and real is no
easy task, yet it is done so
effortlessly here.
Finally, it would be an
injustice not to mention
the brilliant job done by
Awkwafina. Before The
Farewell we’ve seen her
in Oceans 8 and Crazy
Rich Asians, where she’s
been known mainly
for her comedic chops,
and not to mention her
rapping. However, here
we see a totally different
side to her in Billi, where
she expertly tugs and pulls
at our emotions bringing
so many elements to the
character. Billi is at a
slump in her life, she’s
finished college, but she’s
not started her ‘proper’
life yet; this is embodied
quite literally through
Awkwafina in a rounded
shoulders posture adopted
by her throughout a lot of
the film. In the opening
shot we see Billi speaking
in and out of different
personas is where Awk-
wafina excels in drawing
the audience in and
making her so accessible;
we can see her keeping
the ‘act’ for her Nai-Nai,
but then slipping out of it
when alone or speaking
English. Because we’re
able to see the ‘real’ Billi
it makes her so much more
relatable and believable
as a character. Hopefully
this can be a launch-pad
for Awkwafina to begin
taking on more serious
dramatic roles as we’ve
seen she clearly has a
talent for it.
To bring it back to the
picture as a whole, by
combining intricate and
delicate writing with an
outstanding ensemble
cast, Wang has created a
beautiful film that stands
to bring a stark perspec-
tive on American vs
Chinese culture.
