If you don’t already know: why an impeachment
inquiry against Trump has been opened
A primer on the impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump’s phone call with Ukraine’s Zelensky

F
or months,
Speaker of the
House Nancy
Pelosi has been
resisting calls from
progressive members
of her party to open an
impeachment inquiry
into President Donald
Trump. But within days
of breaking news about a
whistle-blower complaint
about Trump, she has
come out in support of it.
On September 25th, Pelosi
announced that the House
of Representatives would
be moving forward with
an official impeachment
investigation, directing
the six House committees
currently investigating the
administration to proceed
with their work under the
impeachment umbrella.
Two factors have pre-
viously prevented Pelosi
from supporting impeach-
ment. The first is that
Pelosi wants to protect
the seats of freshmen
Democrats who represent
moderate districts where
impeachment would be
unpopular. These mod-
erates hold the key to
the Democrats’ power in
Congress – without them,
Democrats would not be
in control of the House
and Pelosi would not be
speaker. Since House
seats are up for re-election
every two years, having
the Democratic Party
support impeachment
could hurt the re-election
chances of these moder-
ates.
The second is that
impeachment is a political
decision – in other words,
it must pass a vote in the
House and in the Senate
to be upheld. The Senate
is currently controlled
by Republicans, none of
whom show any desire at
all to allow impeachment
onto the Senate floor for
voting. Furthermore,
opening an impeachment
inquiry could backfire for
the investigating party
if it is unpopular with
the general public. Bill
Clinton’s impeachment
followed such a path –
impeachment was pushed
forward by Congressional
Republicans but not
supported by the public,
resulting in backlash
against the Republicans
for seeming overly critical
and a surge in public pop-
ularity and sympathy for
Clinton.
On September 23rd, 7
of these moderate Demo-
crats – whose seats Pelosi
have been trying to protect
– published an op-ed
in the Washinton Post
delineating their decision
to support impeachment.
These members all have
backgrounds in national
security, and to that effect
they have found what
President Trump did un-
acceptable.
“The United States
has been very good to
Ukraine... I wouldn’t
say that it’s reciprocal”,
Trump said to the Pres-
ident of Ukraine Volo-
dymyr Zelensky during
a July 25th phone call.
Ukraine receives military
aid from the United States
to protect themselves
against Russian-backed
separatist forces in the
east of the country. 391
million dollars of this aid
had been approved by
Congress weeks earlier,
but unbeknownst to offi-
cials had been halted from
being delivered by the
Trump administration.
In the call, President
Zelensky acknowledges
the financial support
given by the United
States. Trump then says,
“I would like you to do
us a favour”. Trump asks
for two things: (1) to have
the Ukrainian Attorney
General open an investi-
gation into the origins of
the Mueller Investigation,
which he believes stems
from information that
the Ukrainians and Dem-
ocrats colluded to give
to the FBI; and (2) for
Ukraine to cooperate with
Rudy Giuliani (Trump’s
personal attorney) and
Attorney General of the
United States William
Barr in the investigation
of whether Joe Biden had
previously abused his
power as Vice President
to have a prosecutor
improperly fired. The
prosecutor was investigat-
ing a Ukrainian oligarch
who owned the largest
private energy company
in Ukraine, the board of
which, Joe Biden’s son,
Hunter Biden, had sat on
for five years. Neither
of these assertions by
Trump have any evidence
backing them.

“The United
States has
been very
good to
Ukraine...
I wouldn’t
say that it’s
reciprocal”
complaint, filed onAugust
12th by a member of the
National Security Council
staff, describes a violation
of Trump’s constitutional
duties as a President. Ac-
cording to the allegations,
Trump is holding back aid
that Congress has already
appropriated for Ukraine
as leverage, to pressure
Zelensky into cooperating
in an investigation against
a political rival. If proven,
Trump used the power of
his office to solicit inter-
ference from a foreign
country in the 2020 US
election, which is against
federal elections law. Not
to mention that by with-
holding the 391 million
dollars of aid appropriated
for Ukraine, Trump has
undermined Congress by
utilising it for personal
gain.
The complaint also
alleges abuse of the
national security process
with regards to how
transcripts of the phone
call were handled. Upon
realizing how politically
damaging the call may be
if released, White House
lawyers directed senior
White House officials
to restrict access to all
records of the phone call,
especially the word for
word transcript that is
customary for all phone
calls between the Presi-
dent and foreign leaders.
Instead of the standard
computer systems used to
store these transcripts, the
records of the call were
uploaded onto a special
server with restricted
access, used for handling
classified and sensitive
material for national
security. As the call did
not contain any remotely
sensitive information that
should warrant its re-
stricted access, it has been
described as a misuse of
the system and an abuse
of classification privileges
by the White House. The
whistle blower alleges
that this has been done
with multiple calls in the
past.
What, then, should we
expect from the proceed-
ing impeachment inquiry?
Likely a battle over execu-
tive privilege, a legal fight
over Congress’ subpoena
power over the Executive
branch, and much more
public and media scrutiny.
