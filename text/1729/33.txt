POV: This game and I are having a Fallout...
S
o recently I have
been trying to
complete every
game in the Fallout
series in order. Yes, that’s
right EVERY game…
even the trashy PS2 game
‘Brotherhood of Steel’
that nobody remembers
for good reason. The
journey has been a right
laugh and I only have 3
games left. Fallout 4 and
Fallout 76 are going to be
very enjoyable I am sure;
I am deep into the lore
now and nothing is going
to stop me putting 100
hours into another Post-
Nuclear RPG, not even
coursework. However,
there is one game which
continues to be the bane
of my existence.
Fallout Tactics: Broth-
erhood of Steel. Even
typing this now gives
me shivers as I think of
the un-inspired, ‘Help
us find a Vault’ story and
monotonous turn-based
combat system. The
worst part about it is that
I enjoy the game when it
gets going, but it rarely
does that. I am walking
around the isometric map
with my squad of 6 in
real-time and suddenly
combat starts – initialising
a turn-based system until
combat is over – but there
are no enemies to be seen.
When I finally find the
thing shooting at me, I
have already wasted so
much time that I wonder
why they were even there
in the first place. There
are 23 levels in this game
supposedly, I am on level
6 and I’m already tired of
playing. If you are looking
to play the Fallout series
at any point, I would
recommend just sticking
to the main series games
(and New Vegas). Unless
you’re a die-hard fan of
Final Fantasy Tactics
(the heavy inspiration
for Fallout Tactics) then
it would be advisable to
steer clear.
Is it weak to give up
so quickly? Should I
power on and complete
it whilst neglecting the
far superior, Game of the
Year nominated Fallout 4?
I have not decided yet but
one thing is for sure, it is
on hold for now.
I love gaming, and
hopefully next week I will
have some good news to
spread on my progress.
With Trine 4 coming out I
see myself sinking far too
many hours in that to care
about Fallout, but I guess
we just have to wait and
see. I hope everyone has
a great week and remem-
bers to put some time
aside from work to relax
with a hobby, whether that
be gaming or something
else entirely.
POV: Yakuza 0, the perfect blend of everything
W
ith what
little time
I have left
outside of
RSM drinking events, and
dreading the upcoming
workload of this term; I
like to chill out, sit down
and do what normal
people do organise my in-
game property portfolio
whilst slamming Thug’s
faces so hard into the
ground that it sprays out
money confetti- God bless
Yakuza 0, you absolute
masterpiece!
Acting as a prequel to
the original game- Yakuza
(2005)- the story follows
the lives of two Yakuza
and their struggle to
survive with the internal
politics of their respective
clans souring on their
behalf. Having elements
of a soap opera, crime
drama and comedy the
game is an experience, to
say the least – I’m still
in the early sections of
the game but it’s already
landed itself in my top ten
due to its perfect mainte-
nance of the balance of its
themes.
The comedic side is
left to run wild in its side
stories as the MC is asked
to do all sorts of bizarre
odd-jobs like: protecting
a knock-off Michael
Jackson as he tries to film
an all too real version
of Thriller, winning the
championship of the
Japanese equivalent of
Scalextric, infiltrating a
cult to save a concerned
mother’s daughter - all
the while managing your
property portfolio or
deluxe cabaret.
And that’s just the side
content! The real meat of
the game can be found
in its combat, with each
character having three
unique fighting styles
+ weapon selection,
with the fighting styles
ranging from breakdance
kicking someone’s face
into oblivion or swinging
someone around like a
deadly Beyblade.
For all its ridiculous
moments the game
has some genuinely
heart-breaking scenes
with dialogue that makes
you consider the grim
reality of each character’s

situation, as well as their
position in the overlying
political power games. I
find myself engrossed in
this game due to its nature
and ability to presents
so much variety in terms
of experience, themes
and gameplay. With
such laughs, tears and
heart-warming moments
I cannot wait to finish
the game and continue
playing through the series.
