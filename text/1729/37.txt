Resistance is Futile: Why Antibiotic Overprescribing
Remains a National and Global Problem
SCIENCE

A
ntimicrobial
resistance is a
problem that
we’ve known
about for around 75 years
now, with Alexander
Fleming referring to it in
his Nobel Prize speech
way back in 1945. Since
then the problem has
become recognised
internationally. It is
estimated that around
700,000 people every
year die from drug-re-
sistant infections, and
projections suggest that
by 2050, this could rise
to a disturbing 10 million
deaths annually. Causes of
overprescribing include
expectations and demand
by patients, expensive
testing leading to unclear
diagnoses, and excessive
duration of treatment.
Arecent report by NICE
indicated that between
“Projections
suggest that
deaths due to
drug-resistant
infections
could rise to
10 million
annually by
2050”
crobial resistance is still a
major healthcare problem
in the UK. It is estimated
that somewhere between
9% and 23% of antibiotic
prescriptions are inap-
propriately prescribed in
English primary care. A
recent study published
in the BMJ compared
antibiotic prescriptions
in England with national
guidelines and found that
a substantial proportion
of antibiotic courses
exceeded the recommend-
ed duration of treatment.
NICE has a few rec-
ommendations in place to
help combat this problem.
One is its promotion of
antibiotic stewardship
teams, which recommend
that all healthcare settings
in the UK have a team of
core people, including an
antimicrobial pharmacist
and a microbiologist,
who can be consulted
to provide guidance on
best practice of antibiotic
prescribing. NICE also
has guidance on changing
risk-related behaviours
in the population, which
focuses largely on edu-
cation of the public on
the dangers of overuse of
antibiotics, and the dis-
semination of advice and
resources on how to avoid
the spread of infections.
Furthermore, NICE is
working with new funding
models which aim to
delink payment from the
volume of antimicrobials
prescribed, providing a
much-needed economic
incentive for the develop-
ment of new antimicrobial
medicines.
The national imple-
mentation of strategies
to prevent antimicrobial
misuse is a small step
toward tackling this global
problem. The widespread
use of antimicrobials both
in medicine and the vet-
erinary/agriculture indus-
tries is leading to a high
selective pressure which
creates dangerous strains
of resistant microbes,
at a rate that cannot be
matched by research and
development into new
antimicrobial medicines.
