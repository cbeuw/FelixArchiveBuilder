T
o many of us, a
market is where
we visit to pur-
chase groceries.
However, in the financial
application, a financial
market is where a transfer
of capital from the people
who supply it, to the
people who demand it
takes place.
Financial markets play
3 important roles. Firstly,
they play an information-
al role where capital flows
to companies with the best
prospects. The stock price
Money and Capital Markets
is a financial instrument
that holds some form of
monetary value.
Lastly, financial
markets allow for optimal
allocation of risk. The
wide variety of securities
in the market allows
investors to select secu-
rities based on their risk
appetite and this benefits
companies who could
then issue securities at the
best possible prices.
However, financial
markets cannot function
without the support of
financial intermediaries
and investors.
Financial intermediar-
ies are key to an efficient
market system. They
identify potential lenders
to match borrowers and
assist in the transfer of
these funds from surplus
units to deficit units. In-
termediaries also reduce
the investment friction
cost between lenders and
borrowers which provides
a more efficient allocation
of wealth throughout
the system, leading to
greater efficiency for the
economy.
From the investor’s
standpoint, there are 2
main types of financial
markets, Money Markets
(short-term maturities)
and Capital Markets
ity to governments, banks
and other large organi-
sations. For an example,
a large corporation with
surplus cash would prefer
to invest a portion of it in
the money market as it
earns higher interest than
keeping it in its retained
earnings. Similarly, an
individual investor would
not invest all of their
money in risky assets.
After allocating part of
our funds into the optimal
risky portfolio, we would
prefer to allocate the rest
in low risk instruments
found in the money
market to insure against
investment risk (the risk
of incurring losses).
Capital Markets
The capital market
consists of long-term
debt instruments, equities
(stocks) and other fi-
nancial securities which
are issued by firms on
the primary market and
traded by investors on the
secondary
market. Capital market
instruments are character-
ised by longer maturities,
higher risk and higher rate
of returns.
The long-term debt
instruments have matur-
ities that range between
1 year to 30 years. Some
examples of these in-
struments are corporate
bonds, treasury bonds,
inflation-protected securi-
ties and mortgage-backed
securities. These instru-
ments generally carry
higher default risk (risk
of being unable to repay
lenders) than those found
in the money market.
However, they also
provide higher interest
payments to compensate
investors for this addition-
al risk.
Debt securities are first
issued on the primary
market where it is
open to large-scale and
institutional investors.
It is difficult for retail
investors to gain access
to the primary market;
hence they purchase these
securities in the secondary
market instead.
The secondary market
is where these instruments
are traded and circulated.
In this market, it is difficult
to purchase these bonds
at face value. Investors
have to purchase them at
a premium or discount
depending on prevailing
market forces.
Stocks represents the
company that you buy
shares in. Buying shares
which refers to buying
shares in 100 companies.
Shares released on
the primary market are
known as an Initial Public
Offering (IPO). Inves-
tors will purchase these
equities directly from the
issuing company at face
value. These equities are
sold to large-scale and
institutional investors and
are generally inaccessible
to retail investors. Instead,
individual investors go
through the secondary
market to trade equities.
Key takeaways
• Markets allow for
efficient allocation of
funds from lenders
to borrowers.
• Financial markets
are supported by
financial intermedi-
aries & investors
• The 2 main types of
markets are Money
Markets (Short-term
maturities) and
Capital Markets
(Long-term maturi-
ties).
(long-term maturities).
When a security matures,
the firm must repay the
full principal amount plus
interest to the lender.
Money Markets
Money market consti-
tutes of short-term debt
securities with average
maturities of one year or
less. The money market
is characterised by high
liquidity (i.e. easy to sell),
low risk and relatively
low rate of returns. Some
examples of securities
that are traded are treasury
bills, commercial paper,
federal funds and money
market mutual funds.
The function of the
money market is to
provide short-term liquid-

“A financial
market is
where a
transfer of
capital from
the people
who supply it,
to the people
who demand
it”
of a company reflects
the market’s outlook for
the company and hence
stock prices rises and falls
accordingly.
Secondly, financial
markets allow investors to
control their consumption
timing. Throughout a
lifetime on an individual
or firm, they might experi-
ence high and low earning
periods. In order to “shift”
purchasing power from
high to low earnings
period, they might use
securities to store wealth
and transfer consumption
to the future so that in
low-earnings periods,
they can sell these assets
for liquidity. A security
