The anomalous King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard
A
s the chuggy
riff of ‘Self-
I m m o l a t e ’
broke out over
Alexandra Palace last
Saturday, someone threw
an entire pint down me.
Not the best start to one
of the best gigs I’ve been
to in a long time, but
certainly a memorable
one. This night was
definitely memorable for
the band playing as well:
performing their biggest
headline show to date,
Aussie psych-rock lords,
King Gizzard and the
Lizard Wizard, played to
a sold-out venue despite
never breaking into the
top 75 in the UK – weird
even for a band called
King Gizz. Nonetheless,
they made the most of
it, next swinging from
‘Self-Immolate’ into
their catchy ‘Mars for the
Rich’, another song off
their new album Infest
the Rat’s Nest, about the
impending environmental
disaster we’re facing. This
was really one to get the
pit going. Surprisingly,
they next moved onto
‘I’m in Your Mind’, ‘I’m
Not in Your Mind’, and
‘Cellophane’, all songs
from their older 2014
album I’m in Your Mind
Fuzz. By incorporating
their older songs, you got
the feeling the band had
this setlist planned for
years, and suggested how
much this sell-out show
meant to them; as singer/
guitarist Stu Mackenzie
pointed out “it’s a
bit different from the
Shacklewell Arms, isn’t
it?”
They followed this up
with ‘The Great Chain
of Being’ and ‘Plastic
Boogie’, the latter off their
album Fishing for Fishies,
released in April this year.
This song stereotypes
the main sound they
went for in this album,
an electro-boogie vibe
with singer/keyboardist
Ambrose Kenny-Smith
squeezing out the iconic
harmonica riffs which are
common for the record.
Drifting back to their
fourth album of 2017,
P o l y g o n d w a n a l a n d ,
King Gizz next took us
on a swooning journey
through their 11-minute
song ‘Crumbling Castle’,
complete with heavily
psychedelic images
projected onto the huge
screen behind them to
compliment their insane
noise. A few sweaty,
jostling songs later and
King Gizz brought out the
big guns: ‘Rattlesnake’,
arguably their most
famous song. Its populari-
ty in part due to the repeti-
tively addictive riffs used,
but in a bigger part its
success in energising the
crowd was mostly due to
the ridiculously (not) dif-
ficult lyrics: “rattlesnake/
rattlesnake/rattlesnake/
rattlesnake”.
This led us to the final
song. What would it be?
We hadn’t yet had some
of their classics such as
‘Gamma Knife’ or the
more recent ‘Cyboogie’.
The crowd got ready to
pounce upon another
iconic song. As the first
few notes trickled out, it
wasn’t one I (and everyone
else) recognised: looking
at the setlist afterwards it
was ‘Float Along – Fill
Your Lungs’ from their
2013 album of the same
name. Whilst not knowing
the song, it had math rock
vibes mixed with Sgt.
Pepper-era Beatles, so
what’s not to love? As
they finished up their final
song and the house lights
went up over the 10,000+
audience cheering along, I
could see why King Gizz
chose such a poignant
song to finish off their
biggest, and best, gig of
their career so far.
Sleep: the snoozefest in Kentish Town
L
ast Friday night:
a dreary evening,
where all I wanted
as we headed off
to Kentish Town was for
my heart, body and soul to
be warmed by heavy rock.
Luckily, we were heading to
the lovely O2 Forum Kentish
any room up). Entering the
massive, packed auditorium,
Sleep were already on, and
we tried to make up for lost
time by fighting through the
masses – not an easy job as
Sleep fans don’t like to mosh
but instead apparently like
to stand completely still,
allowing only their necks to
swivel in a doom-induced
trance. This hypnosis came
mainly from bassist/singer
Al Cisneros’ all-consuming,
drawn out bass solos which
felt like they took up half
the set, whilst the other two
members remained still
waiting for him to finish. As
far as the setlist went that
fateful Friday, I simply don’t
know when the band started
a new song – they all seemed
to be the same and there was
no interaction between band
and audience, something
which isn’t necessary but
could’ve really livened up an
otherwise quite boring show.
Perhaps, as a stoner rock
band, their live shows need
to be enjoyed as the band
wrote them – high beyond
sense. However, I was bored
beyond sense, and having
arrived late I then left early,
something I have never done
at a gig before. Typically
Sleep then played their most
famous song ‘Dragonaut’,
but I was long gone. Sorry
Sleep, but, well, you just
sent me to sleep.
