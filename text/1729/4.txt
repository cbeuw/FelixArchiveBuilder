T
he first Union
Council of the
year took place
on the 8th of
October. The Council is
the highest democratic
decision-making body
in the Union, at which
the full-time Officer
Trustees (OTs) and key
student volunteers put
policies into place, ad-
dress ongoing issues by
submitting and discuss-
ing papers, and receive
updates from the OTs on
their activities to hold
them accountable.
Standing Orders
The first action of the
year was to ratify a yearly
revision of the Standing
Orders (SOs) of the
Council, which outline
the rules and procedures
that govern its running
and that of its subcom-
mittees (SCs). Although
For example, the SOs
can now be amended like
any other policy, rather
than needing a special
procedure - cutting down
on bureaucracy when it
comes to changing the
fundamental operation
of the Council and SCs.
Similarly, the Council can
now challenge the Chair’s
interpretation of the SOs
directly instead of having
to appeal via the Union
President. Additionally,
the Chair now has the
leeway to interpret when
a “consensus” has been
reached on a decision and
bypass a vote in that case.
And finally, where a policy
on CU President time
commitments to the CWB
having more members
in general and thus less
room for additional
representation. Sugges-
tions to reduce the ERB
representation to only one
CU member was met with
strong statements about
the eradication of CUs’
ability to represent their
students. Although the
Council decided to ratify
the SOs as they are, the
issue will be revisited in
the future.
Also notable is the
splitting of the Clubs, So-
cieties, and Projects Board
(CSPB) into the Sports
Hub and the Societies and
Projects Board, which
was voted on last year
but is being implemented
now. Further clarification
on this will be delivered
by the DPCS at the next
Council.
Board of Trustees
Also ratified were the
chosen students for the ap-
pointed Trustee positions
on the Unions’ Board of
Trustees, Jinpo Xiang and
Milia Hasbani, and a pro-
posal to add an additional
external Trustee – as there
were reportedly issues
with external Trustee
attendance to Board meet-
ings last year.
Reports from Officers
Finally, there were
reports from the Council
Chair and the OTs. These
are visible online. Points
discussed surrounding the
reports included queries
about the lack of infor-
mation on academic and
wellbeing representative
training (expanded upon
in this week’s A Conver-
sation With section by
the DPE), the lateness of
annual room bookings,
the status of the Union’s
takeover of food service
in h-bar, the postgrad-
uate and undergraduate
Summer Balls, and high
level of staff turnover at
the Union.
Regarding the late-
ness of the annual room
bookings, the DPCS
clarified that for rooms
in the college, the
Union is dependent on
responses from Building
Managers at the college
itself – which often leads
to delays. Additionally,
the high staff turnover
in Student Activities has
had an effect on all of
their activities, with work
typically done by unfilled
roles distributed amongst
the DPCS and other
members of the team. The
vacant roles will be filled
as soon as possible.
The DPFS offered
severalclarificationsabout
the lack of food service in
h-bar, which was intended
to begin prior to the start
of term. The original
consultation survey that
went out was useful and
informed decisions made
by the Union in regards to
the direction they wanted
to take with food service.
However, due to issues
that “went unnoticed”, it
emerged after those plans
were made that there was
not the correct equipment
in the h-bar kitchen to
enact that plan. There are
now ongoing discussions
with college about whose
responsibility it is to refit
the kitchen – as the space
belongs to the college,
but the Union wants to
deliver service there.
Currently there is no date
set for when food service
will begin. Suggestions
about the introduction of
a reduced menu were met
with hesitance; the menu
would have to be severely
reduced, and there was
a desire expressed to do
things properly rather
than rushing out a com-
promised service.
There were also ques-
tions raised about the
Summer Ball. Last year,
the Graduate Students’
Union ran a separate
Ball for postgraduates,
and were disappointed
about the lack of Union
support in organisation
cannot commit to helping
with another large-scale
First Meeting of Union Council: A Roundup
Felix is committed this year to demystifying the Union for students, shedding light on the processes and people
behind decision-making - this week, we summarise the juicy bits of the first meeting of the Union Council
“A
controversial
topic was
Constituent
Union
representation
on the ERB
and CWB
boards”
falls fully within the remit
of a particular SC, that SC
can make decisions on
that policy without having
to go through the Council.
One topic of contro-
versy was the disparity
between the representa-
tion of Constituent Union
(CU) members on differ-
ent SCs. While the Edu-
cation and Representation
Board (ERB) has two, the
Community and Welfare
Board (CWB) only has
one – leading CU rep-
resentatives to question
why. The response was
unclear, with reasons
ranging from attempting
to minimise pressures
“There were
essential
changes which
cut down on
bureacuracy
in Council
decision-
making”
in discussion this often
boiled down to minutiae
of phrasing – such as es-
tablishing clarity on which
members have a vote at
different subcommittees
– there were essential
elements touched upon.
“There is no
date set for
when food
service in
h-bar will
begin due
to issues
with kitchen
equipment”
“Regarding
the high staff
turnover in
the Union,
the President
said pressure
for a solution
is coming
from Officer
Trustees, the
Council, and
the Board of
Trustees”
event. However, there are
plans to discuss general
Union support further
at the Sustainability and
Services Board.
The last point raised
was regarding the high
level of staff turnover
at the Union, which
throughout Council was
raised as a reason for
struggling initiatives –
specifically, what the
Union’s response should
be. The Union President
said that the issue is being
actively investigated, with
pressure for a solution
coming from the OTs, the
Council, and also external
Trustees who have also
identified this as a core
problem facing the Union.
“The
postgraduate
Ball will move
to early in the
year to avoid
clashing with
the Summer
Ball event”
and funding. The plan is
to now shift the postgrad-
uate Ball to January or
February so as not to clash
with the Summer Ball.
Requests for more person-
al support from the DPFS
this year were turned
down – as the DPFS role
is taking on a lot more
responsibility for the
Summer Ball compared
to last year, they likely
