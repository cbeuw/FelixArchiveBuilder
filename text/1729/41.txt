Who are Extinction
Rebellion?
L
aunched in
2018, Extinction
Rebellion (XR)
are an inter-
national environmental
campaign committed to
ensuring political action
on the current climate and
ecological emergencies.
They have three demands
for governments across
the world:
Tell the Truth:
Government must tell
the truth by declaring a
climate and ecological
emergency, working
with other institutions
to communicate the
urgency for change.
Act Now:
Government must act
now to halt biodiversity
loss and reduce green-
house gas emissions to net
zero by 2025.
Beyond Politics:
Government must
create and be led by the
decisions of a Citizens’
Assembly on climate and
ecological justice.
While these goals are
ambitious, they reflect
the urgent need to tackle
oncoming environmental
disasters. To put some
of this stark reality into
context, XR points to the
fact that atmospheric CO2
concentration is higher
thanithasbeenin3million
years, the ocean has not
experienced present day
increases of acidification
for at least 300 million
years, and extinction
rates are 1000 times
what they are usually.
The present ‘business as
usual’ scenario, without
dramatic reductions in
greenhouse gas emis-
sions, could realistically
lead to a global temper-
ature increase beyond 4
degrees by 2100, with
catastrophic impact. XR
notes some of the direct
environmental effects
including biodiversity
loss, sea level rise, deser-
tification, wildfires, water
shortages, crop failures,
and extreme weather. This
has shocking impacts on
society: the displacement
of millions of people;
the potential spread of
disease; and increased
risk of wars and conflict,
just to name a few.
Key to their strategy is
non-violent direct action
(NVDA). Motivated by
the success of past civil
rights movements lead
by the likes of Martin
Luther King Jr. and
Mahatma Gandhi, XR is
“Key to their
strategy is
non-violent
direct action,
motivated by
past civil rights
movements”
committed to disruptive,
but peaceful, actions
which force governments
to act. Partial success has
already been achieved via
mass protests across two
weeks in April earlier this
year. Key central London
sites were blocked in-
cluding Piccadilly Circus,
Oxford Circus, Marble
Arch, Waterloo Bridge,
and Parliament Square.
Shortly following the
protests, then-Prime
Minister Theresa May
committed the UK to a
legally binding target of
reaching carbon neutrality
by 2050, with other major
European countries fol-
lowing suit. In addition,
the UK Parliament
successfully declared a
climate emergency. XR
has implemented further
action to ensure tangible
action is taken to make
this declaration legitimate.
The present two-week
rebellion taking place
across the globe has
already gathered wide-
spread media attention
and forced the environ-
mental emergency into the
political debate (despite
the domination of Brexit!)
In particular, London has
seen Westminster virtually
shut down, with over 500
protesters being arrested
in just two days of action.
Imperial College XR
Universities have
traditionally played a
key role in pushing for
social progress; the April
protests included support
from the youth faction of
XR, although a specific
UK-wide university
group had not formed.
Students were able to
join their local or regional
XR group, although their
term-time efforts were
not being effectively
utilised. The summer
break allowed for many
students to engage more
directly with XR strategy,
subsequently leading to
the formation of many
university groups in early
August with a callout for
more to join the fold.
Gathering support for
the group at Imperial was
initially a slow process,
although it was aided by
the structures put into
place by the newly formed
XR Universities group.
More recently, Imperial’s
group has dramatically
grown in size – in part
due to increased media
coverage, but also because
(perhaps more in the spirit
of XR’s grassroots style)
members are volunteering
to ‘spread the word’ and
organise events to encour-
age others to join.
Key successes of the
group so far have included
engagement on the 20th
September Climate
Strike and a collaborative
workshop with LeoSoc
to design banners and
placards for the October
rebellion.
On the 9th of October
XR Imperial formally
engaged with the London
actions, arriving at 10am
in St James’s Park for a
full day of protest. Those
who joined found the
events to be overwhelm-
ingly positive; there were
celebrations with music
and dancing as well as
entertainment acts to
make light of what would
otherwise be a sombre
situation. A key moment
was Imperial’s role in
the `die-in’ at Trafalgar
Square – this involved
playing dead in order to
convey the severity of
the oncoming environ-
mental crises and remind
members of the public of
the urgent action that is
required.
Tributes were paid
throughout the day to en-
vironmental activists who
had been killed across
the world, and spirits
remained high despite the
large number of arrests
and confiscation of equip-
ment. Joining with the
rebellion strengthened the
resolve of members of XR
Imperial and brought to
the forefront the necessity
for immediate and wide-
spread measures to tackle
both climate change and
the ecological emergency.
While the two-week
protest will eventually
come to an end, XR
Imperial intend to
continue working closely
with other environmental
groups around the College
to push for more transpar-
ency and greater efforts
to combat the environ-
mental crises. Successes
so far (which have been
a long time coming)
have included the levy
on plastic cups and the
commitment to renewable
sources for all bought-in
electricity on campus.
College to stop investing
in fossil fuel companies
- a step already taken by
many leading UK uni-
versities - but Imperial’s
leadership maintain that
doing so would under-
mine any environmental
cause. Pause for thought
is required to consider Im-
perial’s strong links with
fossil fuel industry – our
own president, Alice Gast,
has received $375,000
annually to sit on the
board of Chevron. Career
fairs for the energy sector
on campus continue to be
dominated by the fossil
fuel industry and no direct
action has been made to
reduce this.
The XR Imperial group
wants to join the effort to
improve the College’s
record and hopes to bring
NVDA tactics to the fore-
front of its actions, which
have already proven
successful in many other
London universities.

whereby events and
actions are discussed.
