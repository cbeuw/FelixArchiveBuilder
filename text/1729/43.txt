I
t may seem counter-
productive for the
Royal College of
Science Union to be
a celebrator and prolifer-
ator of fake science. At
a time when deniers of
basic science are already
given far too much atten-
tion (including our own
alumnus and crackpot,
‘weather forecaster’ Piers
Corbyn), it feels like our
priorities should lie with
platforming and focusing
on real scientists talking
about real science. So
why is it that, each March,
the RCSU reduces the au-
dience of a packed Great
Hall to tears of laughter
with presentations of
science that is completely,
utterly, gloriously fake?
The Festival of Bad
Ad hoc Hypotheses (or
BAHFest) is a celebration
of well-argued, and thor-
oughly researched, but
completely incorrect sci-
entiﬁc theory. Launched
at MIT in 2013 by SMBC
Comics’ Zach Weiner-
smith, BAHFest has run
its only non-US show
right here at Imperial
Should you elect
to attend next year’s
BAHfest, you will ﬁnd
yourself in a diverse
audience of 740: Imperial
students and senior
academics, attendees
travelling from across
the UK or from other
parts of Europe for the
show, Google software
devs, Buzzfeed writers,
children and pensioners.
You’ll see presentations
ranging from a theory
that ﬁres on the African
Savannah largely result
from cheetahs crashing
into trees at great speed,
to a proposal for a new
London rapid transport
network using the hy-
draulic pressure of the
city’s sewage system.
And you’ll see the room
erupt with laughter at
jokes told with Feynman
diagrams. At the very end,
the winner (judged by a
panel of serious expert
scientists) is awarded
a 3D-printed statue of
alchemist Hennig Brand
boiling his own wee in the
hopes of producing gold.
At BAHFest, the
audience is in on the joke.
We see the presenters
make ludicrous extrap-
olations from graphs,
casually equate correla-
tion with causation, and
make sweeping conclu-
sions from single-digit
sample sizes, and we
catch the cheeky grin
hidden under the deadpan
delivery. BAHFest is not
just fake science – it is a
mockery of it, and in the
current climate, it feels all
the more necessary.
BAHFest 2020 will take
place Saturday March
21st, in the Great Hall.
Like last year, it will be
running in conjunction
with the London stop
of the Ig Nobel Prize
Roadshow. Submissions to
give a presentation open
in December, and tickets
will go on sale in January,
so keep an eye out!

Chris Carter
RSMU President
T
he RSMU runs
six sports clubs,
all of which are
open to players
of all skill levels and
even to non-Miners:
Badminton, Football,
Hockey, Lacrosse, Netball
and Rugby. These clubs
all had stalls at last week’s
Welcome Fair, but if
you didn’t fancy wading
across Queen’s Lawn you
might not have had an
opportunity to sign up, so
read on to ﬁnd out more!
Badminton
RSM Badminton trains
twice a week in Ethos –
12-2pm on Tuesdays and
1-2pm on Thursdays!
More relaxed than their IC
and ICSM counterparts,
RSM Badminton play
in the LUSL (London
University Sports League)
and provide a mix of
casual and more intense
sessions.
Cricket
RSM Cricket is the
RSMU’s youngest sports
club, formed just last
year, and is still ﬁnding
its feet. The club is open
to anyone, regardless of
ability, so get involved!
Football
After a decade and
a half of consecutive
Bottle Match losses, RSM
Football ﬁnally triumphed
over Camborne in last
year’s Bottle Match. RSM
Football also compete
in the LUSL, achieving
solid results, and run a
highly popular inter-year
5-a-side event.
Hockey
RSM Hockey runs
Men’s, Women’s and
mixed teams, so everyone
is welcome! They train
every Tuesday, meeting
in the RSM Foyer at 5pm
before heading over to
Harlington in a minibus.
They also run socials
throughout the year and
their annual tour to Black-
pool is not to be missed!
Lacrosse
RSM Lacrosse was
formed only 4 years ago
but has quickly built a
reputation for itself. With
a 100% Bottle Match win
rate, this club is a great
way to guarantee you’re
on the winning side at the
sports event of the year!
They train every Monday
at 12 in Hyde Park,
meeting in the RSM Foyer
a few minutes before to
guide people over.
Netball
RSM Netball trains
every Wednesday at 2 in
Ravenscourt Park. Despite
not always achieving
the best results at Bottle
Match, they make up for
it with their socials! The
league team is women-on-
ly, but men are welcome
to join as social members!
Rugby
RSM Rugby headlines
the infamous Bottle
Match – our annual varsity
between the RSMU
and Exeter’s Camborne
School of Mines. They
train every Friday at 12
in Hyde Park and also
run socials throughout the
year!
That’s all from me this
week, but don’t forget
to get involved in the
RSMU’s sports clubs, even
if you’re not a member of
the RSMU!
