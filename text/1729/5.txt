T
he Union’s
‘ W e l c o m e
C a r n i v a l ’
event, formerly
known as the Freshers’
Ball, took place on
Friday the 4th of October.
Although historically the
Freshers’ Ball has been a
highly successful event –
for many the highlight of
Freshers’ Fortnight – the
rebranded event fell flat
this year.
The Carnival was
advertised as a ‘UV
neon rave’, featuring stilt
walkers and a light show,
in an attempt to draw new
students in and get them
partying and socialising
in the Union. The change
in name and style was
apparently due to a push
from a small contingent of
staff – some of whom were
in interim roles – who felt
that the “Freshers’” Ball
had negative connotations
to drinking games and
binge drinking.
Unfortunately, the
rebranding seems to have
been damaging. Ticket
sales fell by half. While
sales in previous years
topped 1000 students – as
was advertised on the
Welcome Carnival page
on the Union website –
this year pre-sales only
reached 383, with a further
131 sold on the door.
Reportedly, the
maximum capacity was
also reduced from around
1200 to 850, as the ex-
ternal security company
claimed they would
not be able to keep up.
This follows reports that
students have found the
security currently con-
tracted by the Union to be
highly unprofessional in
their conduct, shouting
and swearing at students
at Sports Night last week
and “play-fighting” in
Metric prior to the Carni-
val event.
respond to requests for
comment on this matter,
Metric allegedly only
reached around £350 in
sales on the evening.
This is only just
above the minimum bar
spend for CSP events
held at Metric – which,
considering this event is
meant to be a highlight
of Welcome, should be a
target the Union can blow
out of the water.
Additional trouble
struck when the headline
act, Patrick Nazemi, an
Ibiza Rocks resident DJ,
had to cancel due to a
family emergency. Gem
Precious, the supporting
act and an up-andcoming
UK DJ, offered to cover
both sets. However, there
are currently-unconfirmed
reports that Metric was
so quiet that she packed
up and left after only
one hour – expressing
film such an ill-attended
event. The Union once
again refused to address
this particular claim in
their response.
The events of the
evening followed an
odd start when everyone
currently in the Quad -
including Union staff in
their building and in the
West Basement - were
told they had to leave and
would not be allowed to
re-enter. This was later
proven to not be the case.
Following the fall in
drinks sales from the
bars last year and the
issues facing the Union
regarding other Welcome
events such as the Fair,
many students are starting
to feel concerned about
the future direction of the
organisation.
The 'Welcome Carnival': Trouble at the Bars
The newly named 'Welcome Carnival' was an unsuccessful night for the Union, with lower-than-expected ticket
and drinks sales
“Ticket sales
fell by half
- from over
1000 to 383
pre-sales and
only 131 more
sold on the
door”
The effect on the
evening was detrimental.
While the Union did not

the Quad,

Union staff
members,

and would not

later proven to
be wrong”
