Books Writer
T
he Testaments
is a sequel
to Margaret
Atwood’s 1985
dystopian novel, The
Handmaid’s Tale. It is set
15 years after the first, in
the same totalitarian state
of Gilead, where a fertility
crisis and patriarchal fun-
damentalism have come
together to foster a society
where women are legally
subordinate, with many
in child-bearing slavery.
The Handmaid’s Tale has
found its way back into
popular culture, more than
30 years after its initial
release. It has inspired
protests; in the US there
has been a series of
protests with the costume
of a Handmade becoming
synonymous with the
resistance to what has
been seen as the curtail-
ment of women’s rights
under Donald Trump’s
presidency. Following a
critically acclaimed TV
series accompanying The
Handmaid’s Tale that she
helpedwrite(andcameoed
in), Atwood has written
a sequel, dubbed “the
literary event of the year”.
Following its release, the
book went straight to the
top of bestseller lists and
was also shortlisted for
the Booker prize ahead of
its publication.
The Testaments follows
a similar patchwork style
to its precedent work,
where chapters are not
always chronological. It
is even more fractured,
narrated by three different
characters. In contrast,
The Handmaid’s Tale is
told entirely from Offred’s
perspective,theHandmaid
of high-ranking Com-
mander Fred. Handmaids
are fertile women who are
passed around between
elite families until they
bear a child for them,
with pregnancy being the
only time they are given
respect or recognition.
Any hint of individual
identity or agency is
banished to memory, with
even their names taken
away and replaced by
their superiors. Offred’s
narration of events comes
with personal introspec-
tion that is beautifully
poetic and poignant at
times. The Testaments, as
the name suggests, reads
more like a dialogue. It
is the testimonial of three
main characters: Aunt
Lydia, Agnes and Daisy.
Although less beautiful
than The Handmaid’s
Tale, having three main
characters’ voices gives
the benefit of multiple
perspectives, allowing
the reader to get to know
Gilead in a multifaceted
way.
The most compelling
account in the book
comes from Aunt Lydia.
She is one of the founding
members of the dicta-
torship and coordinates
the womens’ sphere. As
an aunt, she is among
the only rank of women
who is permitted to
read and write, although
her personal diary is
smuggled. She chronicles
her journey from a liberal
judge before the rise of
Gilead to the time she is
writing, where a statue has
been erected in her honour
and her portrait hangs
in every girls’ school.
Torture and abuse is the
main part of this journey,
inflicted on and then by
her. The description of
these tactics is vivid and
brutal, and at times diffi-
cult to read. Atwood says
all the tortuous techniques
described in the books
are based on historical
archives, and the details
are chilling. The result
is an incredibly cruel,
cynical woman who has
gone to incredible lengths
to establish her power.
Aunt Lydia’s account
bears almost no resem-
blance to that of Agnes.
Raised in Gilead in an
upper-class family, she
knows no different to
the society around her,
and doubtful and pious
in equal measure. She is
naive and hopeful, despite
being traumatised by the
barbarity of the regime.
Her youthful outlook is
similar to that of Daisy,
the third narrator. Daisy
has grown up in Canada
and offers an outsider’s
perspective on Gilead.
Her language and focus
Does the Testaments live up to the hype of the Handmaid’s Tale?

“The
Testaments
reads more
like a
dialogue”
“An incredibly
cruel, cynical
woman who
has gone to
incredible
lengths to
establish her
power”
reads, at times, like young
adult fiction. While her
focus lies in toppling the
regime, she makes time
to ruminate on her crush
and whether or not she is
impressing him.
In some ways, the three
storytellers have agency
and hope, making The
Testaments inherently less
depressingthanTheHand-
maid’s Tale. The feeling
of optimism is helped, of
course, by the fact that the
readers know that Gilead
does eventually fall. The
complex female charac-
ters are well-developed,
with their relationships
depicted masterfully. The
plot is fast-paced and
enjoyable, but ultimately
“A good
sequel rather
than an
excellent
work in its
own right”
predictable. The Testa-
ments satisfies the need to
know more about Gilead
and its eventual demise. It
does not retract from The
Handmaid’s Tale in any
way, but it lacks original-
ity and is a good sequel
rather than an excellent
work in its own right.
