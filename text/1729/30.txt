simple sitcom gradually becomes something special.

I
n my close friendship
circles, I have always
had a bit of a reputa-
tion for getting a little
too passionate about, well,
pretty much everything.
So, when I started to
relentlessly insist that
everyone should really,
really, REALLY should
be getting on board the
Schitt’s Creek train and
binge this show right now,
no one was particularly
surprised. However, my
uncontainable passion for
this show is far beyond my
usual excitement levels.
Having watched five
seasons in just about three
days – which admittedly
was not my best work,
but with a dissertation
deadline looming on the
horizon, not too shabby,
I daresay – I figured that
this would be an excellent
place to carry on declar-
ing my love for this little
show that could, months
after my original binge,
and reflect on what makes
this show the criminally
underrated juggernaut that
it is.
Having recently
wrapped up its fifth (and
penultimate) season, this
small Canadian show has
been gathering a rather
impressive cult following.
Unaware of its existence
until just before its fifth
season concluded, I
decided to give the show
a go after coming across
several articles on my
Facebook timeline hailing
it as ‘the best sitcom since
Parks and Recreation’,
another all-time favourite
of mine.
So what is Schitt’s
Creek about?
Schitt’s Creek tells
the story of the once-in-
credibly-wealthy Rose
family, who find them-
selves completely broke,
thanks to a crooked
business manager. They
lose everything. Well,
everything except a small
town called Schitt’s Creek
which they had bought
as a joke for their son’s
16th birthday. Although a
rather familiar, arguably
simple premise, it is
immensely elevated by
the acting, the writing,
and most importantly, the
heart. So, do read on as I
go through all the differ-
ent things that made me
fall deeply in love with
this show.
Keeping it in the
family
Created by the real-life
father-son duo Eugene
Levy (American Pie,
anyone?) and Dan Levy,
the show stars the two
Levy’s as the family
patriarch, Johnny, and the
flamboyant son, David.
Eugene Levy’s daughter,
Dan’s sister, Sarah Levy
also has a small part,
portraying the role of
the aloof waitress at
Café Tropical, where the
family frequently dine.
The family matriarch,
Moira Rose, is portrayed
by none other than the
incomparable Catherine
O’Hara (Home Alone,
A Nightmare Before
Christmas), who might as
well be considered family
to the Levy’s, having
frequently worked with
Eugene throughout their
decades-spanning careers.
One can’t help but think
that one of the reasons
for the impeccable family
dynamics within the show
may just be that these
people are, in fact, family.
There are some cast
members who are new to
the family, though. Annie
Murphy, who delightfully
portrays Alexis, the
Roses’ selfish, self-ab-
sorbed daughter who’s
had many an adventures
back in her days of wealth
(kidnapped by a Thai
drug lord? Check! Being
picked up by the South
Korean secret police?
Check!). Emily Hamp-
shire portrays the recep-
tionist at the hostel that
the Roses resort to living
in perfectly and captures
the essence of being an
outsider to the absurd
world of the Roses, much
like the audience. Chris
Elliott and Jennifer Rob-
ertson are also delightful
in their roles as the Schitt
household, who tradi-
tionally hold the mayoral
position in the town. A
later addition to the show,
Noah Reid portrays the
lovable Patrick so perfect-
ly that one can’t help but
fall more in love with him
with each passing episode.
Catherine O’Hara
Yes, she really deserves
her own section. A
criminally underrated
actress, O’Hara perfectly
captures the essence of
Moira Rose, an ex-soap
star who is completely
oblivious to life as most
people live it. Adopting a
very non-descript, hilari-
ous accent, O’Hara often
dominates the show with
her pitch-perfect comedic
timing. One of my favour-
ite moments of the show
is when the Roses go to
a car dealership, and for
some inexplicable reason,
Moira decides to speak in
a (brilliant, magnificent)
Cockney accent to get
a better deal on a car.
O’Hara has just been
nominated for an Emmy
award for the role, so if
you don’t believe me,
believe the awards com-
mittee. She is a complete
revelation.
Where Everyone Fits
In
The show is careful not
to identify the country
where the imaginary
town of Schitt’s Creek is
located. However, regard-
less of its location on the
map, there are some things
about the town that people
all over the world can
Outstanding acting is only one of the things that elevates Schitt’s Creek above other sitcoms // Andrew Eccles
