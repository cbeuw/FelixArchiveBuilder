Miserable Morphy
Everything started normally—R.C.S. travelled by way of Glou-
cester Road to Putney and Guilds by High Street Ken., where Rod
Jones, Guilds Vice-President, had his first meeting of the day with
the gentlemen in blue. The trouble concerned the Guilds hand-
luggage—several large Michelin lorry tyres. During the day he had
his name taken once, was told not to be cheeky, and asked to keep the
crowd in order countless times.
On arrival at Putney, 250 Guilds and 150 R.C.S. were told to
fight 50 Mines. At the time this seemed a great move ; after all, who
pinched the Spanner ? But, when custard pies had been pitched into
Chris Tye's and Bob Schroter's faces by Jim Marshall (Vice-Presi-
dent, Mines) " I did not know what I was doing." Mines, after a
bombardment of 1^ cwt. of tomatoes, 1 cwt. soot and \ cwt. flour,
felt they were so outnumbered that they just ran, and ran, nearly to
Hammersmith.
NODDY BIKES
Then there followed a long
wait while R.C.S. and Guilds
officials tried to organise them-
selves into two separate sides and
start again. But very few people
were co-operating, there were
various distractions. U.C. came
and nearly stole a fire-extin-
guisher off Jezebel which upset
R.C.S. and then two policemen
on Noddy Bikes roared through
a crowd of Guildsmen, being
liberally covered in flour on the
way.
BOAT RACES
A brief melee between the two
Colleges took place, and four or
five R.C.S. and 1 Guildsman lost
their trousers. This led on to the
Boat Race. The Lowry was won
by Guilds by two lengths over
R.C.S. Another wait. Another
interruption by U.C. Then the
Morphy Race. . This also was
won by Guilds, 2\ length winners
over Mines.
After another interruption
from U.C. the journey back be-
gan. This took some time since
there are several zebra-crossings,
and London Transport were
troublesome as well. On arrival
at Prince Consort Road via South
Kensington, a ring-a-ring o' roses
round the Albert Hall was per-
formed and that was that! !
IN RETROSPECT
This year's Morphy Day was
pathetic. There were too few
R.C.S. and Mines, there was very
little College spirit—-e.g. when
Pete Cunningham, R.C.S. Vice-
President, was being de-trousered
without success, no R.C.S. men
came to assist. Surely, the idea
of Morphy Day (other than the
boat races) is to have good bois-
terous fun, not to hound a
minority miles down the tow
path. If the constituent Unions
cannot organise their big day of
the year better there is no point
in holding it.

SILWOOD IDYLL
Some people like their weekends carnal, others, intellectual;
twenty-seven of the latter, perhaps also attracted by the economics
of the thing, encoached on Saturday, 2nd November, for Silwood
Park, Sunninghill, for one of Touchstone's Weekends. They were
surprised by the hut accommodation, but it was pleasant enough, and
a walk through Windsor Great Park on Sunday morning was delight-
ful. Food was excellent and company congenial.
Mr. Frank Greenaway was un- borne in mind, at least one group
fortunately unable to address us, was surprised at the views attribu
being in hospital, but Mrs. Green-
away gallantly started the pro-
ceedings with her views about the
Robbins report, the Two Cul-
tures, and the emancipation of
women. A discussion followed,
and after dinner the company
broke up into three groups which
attempted to answer such specific
questions as : What, if anything,
can be done to bridge the gap be-
tween the two Cultures at Univer-
sity, Grammer School and Pri-
mary School levels?; are the aims
listed by Robbins for Higher
Education (a) the right ones, (b)
in the right order of importance,
(c) exhaustive? has the emancipa-
tion of women been beneficial to
men? and so on. The discussion,
at least in your correspondent's
group, was of good intellectual
standard, and a fair balance was
struck between progressive una-
nimity and democratic disagree-
ment. At the following day's
summing-up (when, it must be

The sign said " Closed to Motor Vehicles—Veteran Cars Only."
Boanerges sailed past, and took his place at position 103 in the
" Paddock," to applause from early rising Guildsmen. Within a
matter of minutes, reinforcements arrived, clad mainly in pyjamas.
After a short chat with the national press, Bo left in the direction
of Brighton at about 8.15. The early morning crowd were treated to
a Boomalak'a. A duck fell into the Serpentine. Mike Cox was seen
picking plastic daffodils. They matched his yellow tartan pyjamas.
A group photograph was taken on Albert's feet.
Meanwhile back on the road
Bo, just being run in after his
major operation the week before,
was experiencing some valve
trouble in Brixton. At Norbury
he had a seizure. His engine had
only been rebuilt on Thursday.
After working on him for an
hour, he went like a Bo-mb right
through to Brighton, spending
much of his time in the oncom-
ing traffic lane, preceded by a
motor cycle escort, and followed
by the Land Rover maintenance
crew. On one hill, free wheeling,
he managed to reach 50 m.p.h.
However, he did disappoint
many people when he went up
hills. They were expecting him
to stop. Bo hit Brighton at 1.15
p.m., having averaged 14 m.p.h..
Harry Watson and Pete Moss,
the two drivers, went with Bob
Schroter to the Motor Club
Luncheon at the Neville House
Hotel, where they met Col.
Browne, Hon. Vice-President of
the Club, and designer of Bo in
1902. Col. Browne gave up the
Veteran Car Club Luncheon in
order to attend. He is also Vice-
President of the V.C.C.

ted to it by its " chairman "), it
appeared that yes, most people
believed in C. P. Snow's two
categories, that specialisation
should be deferred to the last
possible moment, and there
should be more opportunity to
change courses after entering a
University. Robbins' ideas of the
aims of Higher Education were
generally accepted, but the
" transmission of a common cul-
ture and common standards of
citizenship" was viewed with some
bewilderment and more misgiv-
ings. Although some thought the
emancipation of women is incom-
plete, and others that it was only
part of the general emancipation
of the lower classes, most agreed
it was beneficial, if not to men
directly. Undergraduates came
out strongly against the boarding
school system, while their elders
dwelt more on its virtues.
