?E ITER FORM THE JUDO CLUB
To the Editor
Dear S i r , .
Altough the Judo Club f u l l y appre-
ciate any space we are given i n ' F e l i x ' , we
would rather that the facts given bear a
closer resemblance to the truth than was the
case i n the l a s t issue,
. TWO points require correction:
1) The venue for our home matches i s the
Budokwci and
2) Training conditions are very much closer
to the primative than the 'superb'.
In anticipation of more accurate
repaoting on future Club a c t i v i t i e s .
Yours sincerely,
P, F. Hunt. ( Hon. Sec. JC)

judgement, Harry Gluck, Editor of Sennet,

done without offering the Board any expla-
nation. The new Editor i s former News
Editor Jennie Wright.
ROBBINS, GO AHEAD
In a debate held at South Side last Wed-
nesday the mot ion that 'this House re-
quests the immediate implementation of
the Bobbins Report' was approved by a
small majority.
Tony Berry and Jonathon Tutleman
painted a rosy picture of our educated
children (several members looked rather
guilty at this) but the customary caution
of Union President Dave Watson, supported
by Gopal Strinavason raised a few doubts
in peoples minds about 'instant education'.
Although the attendance wa again small,
speakers form the floor showed that Students
at I.G. do have views about things other
than Mascots, Sex, and Beer ( i n that
order ). Gordon H a l l .
HEALTH ROOM HATES SOUTH SIDE
There's the case of the g i r l who, after a
South Side party, needed 9 stitches i n her
nose the day prior to her wedding. Just
one of the many accidents that the Health
Room has had to deal with as a result of
people passing through locked glass doors,
f a l l i n g down the spiral staircases ( esp.
dangerous to g i r l s waering high heels ),
and students climbing out of one room into
another v i a the window.
The Health Room i s also worried about
escape during f i r e . Not only are the s t a i r -
cases connecting landings dangerous with a
crowd rushing down, but the concrete stairs
are faced with wood; and how many residents
are familiar with the escape routes from
the balconies to the ground when the l i f t s
are NOT TO BE USED? These too are of a
dangerously narrow-radius s p i r a l nature.
In short then, the Health room con-
sider the South Side Halls of Residence
poorly.designed for use by students, who
are naturally higher spirited than the
average human being. South side has,
perhaps, more dangers lurking for the us -
wary than any other I.G. building.
WATCH IT, STYNX !
Brighton Students' Carnival Magazine has
been sent to the Public Prosecutor f o i l -
owing complaints about i t s pornographic
content. Perhaps 'Stynx' has been lucky
to have so f r escaped to same fate.
