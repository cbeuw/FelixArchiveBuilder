HOCKEY
FIRST ROUND K.O.
I.C. OUT OF CUP
I.C. 2, Goldsmiths 3.
By Kerry Peters
Losing a Cup match is always a rather bitter experience, espec-
ially in such an early stage of a competition, and the fact that
Wednesday's game could" easily have gone to either team did little to
cheer the I.C. XI. But they had no reason to be ashamed of their
performance for, considering the appalling conditions under which
the match was played, both teams' play was admirable.
I.C. settled down the more
quickly and were unfortunate to
miss some early scoring chances.
As it was, the first goal came for
Goldsmiths from a penalty flick
awarded after a shot from a cor-
ner was stopped on the line by a
defender's foot. I.C. fought back
and equalised through a,finegoal
by Anketell after 20 mins., and
the score at half-time wasl-1.
Goldsmiths Take the Lead
Early in the second half a de-
fensive muddle let in Goldsmiths
for their second goal, but on
three-quarters time I.C. equalised
again, this time when the Gold-
smiths goalkeeper had missed an
easy clearance, leaving an open
goal for Hough to score. With
about ten minutes left to" play,
and the game still in the babance,
Goldsmiths took the lead from a
short corner and I.C. were fighting
from behind again.
Penalty Missed
A draw, which probably would
have been the fairest result, was
almost within their grasp, when
the Goldsmiths goalkeeper sat on
the ball and I.C. were awarded a
penalty flick. Unfortunately
Phillips's shot hit the crossbar,
and with only a few minutes of
play left I.C. didn't look like
scoring again.
Of the two defences, EC's,
looked the more solid, but their
forwards, although moving well
together at times, lacked the ne-
cessary finishing power, so that
possibly on this account the Gold-
smiths victory was a deserved
one.
CAMBRIDGE
SQUASHED
The weekend saw the annual
pilgrimage of two squash teams
to a provincial university. Along
with the ten players went an as-
sortment of fans and the Captain
of Golf. The latter was seen only
once throughout the week-end
and then loudly declared himself
to be in search of " randy birds ";
he was seen no more.
The reason for the weekend
was somewhat different, and al-
though one member was seen with
two strange girls late on Satur-
day his squash appeared unaf-
fected. We continue to have an
exceptionally strong team, prob-
ably the strongest college team in
the country, and our record shows
we will take some beating.

RUGBY
Still Unbeaten
The feeder sides in the club, the
Ex 1st and A's) still boast an
unbeaten record after four
matches and the Ex A's only de-
feat has been at the hands of the
Bl's. Such strength at these levels
has helped the 1st X V to put up
some very good performances
lately even though they have suf-
fered from a few injuries among
the backs.
Faults are still present, how-
ever, the main one being the
team's slow starting. Being 14
points down to Kings after 15
minutes and 11 down to Rich-
mond after 10 minutes just isn't
good enaughl The team finishes
strongly enough, but we must
learn to go off with a bang before
the important Cup Match on
Nov. 20th.
Barry Meir gets the
ball away during a
recent match at Har-
lington.
Afifi, an Egyptian interna-
tional of some fame; at Cam-
bridge he won twice for the
college and then immediately
demolished the Varsity captain
while playing for ULU. The first
team beat Christ's and Queen's
while the second lost to John's
and St. Catherine's. Meanwhile
we can look forward to Oxford
next term where ladders are con-
sidered an easier form of entry
after midnight than drains.
SOCCER
WEDNESDAY'S CHILD
THE FIRST team do not seem
to be able to win on Wednesdays
although their Saturday form
shows more of a fighting spirit.
Drastic measures must be taken
to transfer this to the important
league matches. Defeats by Kings
and U.C. as compared with draws
against Christ's College and Guys
(the latter wefinishedwith 9 men)
illustrate this inconsistency.
In contrast, the 4th XI are now
top of their league, being unde-
feated in 4 matches and having
scored 29 goals.
I TODAY I
Can I.C. Athletic Club again
be the first club of the season to
have the college flag flown in
their honour ?
Today the University of Lon-
don Winter Relays and Field
Events Championships take place
at Motspur Park and we travel
there confident that we shall re-
turn with at least lone of the
trophies. For the last few years
it has been the Relays cup.- Per-
haps it will be our turn to hold
the Field Events trophy this year.
CROSS-COUNTRY NOTES
By Pete Crews
About mid-day on Saturday,
2nd November, thirteen club
members arrived at St. Luke's
College, Exeter, for the Wood-
bury Road Relay. Five people had
driven down to Gillingham the
evening before and had employed
the hospitality of Mr. and Mrs.
Woodcock who gave them over-
night accommodation. The re-
mainder, plus one supporter,
drove the full 172 miles on the
Saturday.
The relay was for a team of 6
and the course was over a square
circuit consisting of 4 miles of
road. Everybody did creditable
times, especially Joe Fitzsimmons
who returned 22 mins. 39 sees.
The final positions out of the 25
entries were: I.C. 1st, 16th in
2:22: 9; and I.C. 2nds, 20th in 2:
25:50
Our league position after one
set of league matches can hardly
be described as exciting. In
League I the Ists are 6th and
the 2nds are 9th out of the ten
teams involved. Meanwhile, the
3rds are 23rd in League II.

MIXED HOCKEY
I.C. entered two teams in a
tournament at the L.S.E. ground,
New Maiden on Sunday Nov. 6th.
Final results were generally con-
fused in the falling darkness.
* * *
BASKETBALL
Both Regent St. Poly and
L.S.E. have been taken to extra
time by I.C., but both won by
the narrowest of margins in the
end.

ATHLETICS
The trials threatened for last
Wednesday were rained off at the
last minute. L.C.C. decreed that
no implements could be thrown
under such conditions.
* * *
LAWN TENNIS
Despite the weather during the
two winter terms, R.CS., Guilds
and, it is reputed, Mines, play
tennis against each other, for the
Brown Cup, and also against
other colleges. A winter singles
tournament is also under way;
the first three rounds should be
played off by Christinas.
