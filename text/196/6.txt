5 YEARS FROM NOW?
At Turner & Newall we give a considerable
amount of thought to the question o'f a man's
future. And our graduate training scheme is
planned to be adaptable to his individual needs
-to employ and extent) his attainments to the
full.
You May Know Our Name But . . .__ just to
remind you - we are not only the dominant
asbestos group in Britain, we also nave a large
and growing stake in plastics, in insulation, in
mineral wool, and in glass fibre ... aH adding
up to a £100,000,000 business with some
40,000 employees. Big enough to give a man
scope. Yet, because each of our nine British
companies largely runs its own affairs, not so
big that the essential 'human touch' is
endangered.
This balance is reflected in our executive
development training which, far from tying a
man down to any one type of career —
production, sales, administration - allows him
time to discover his true potential.
This way, we invariably find that the graduate
assumes managerial responsibility more con-
fidently - and certainly earlier -than is usual
in a modern industrial complex.

EISENSTEIN'S
IVAN THE TERRIBLE
Sergei Eisenstein was born in
1898. He studied engineering
but war came before he quali-
fied. In the Revolutionary Army
he met theatrical artists and with
them set up the highly experi-
mental Proletcult Theatre in
Moscow. He experimented with
films and was invited to make
propaganda films to glorify the
Revolution. "Battleship Potem-
kin " and "October" were highly
successful and established Eisen-
stein as a great artist.
In later years he had difficulty
in reconciling his creative artistry
with the ideological message his
films were supposed to convey.
Meanwhile he taught film tech-
nique at the Institute of Cinema-
tography founded by Lenin. With
the threat of war in 1938 he was
asked to produce a patriotic film.
He chose the story of Prince
Alexander Nevsky, set in the 13th
century. This was so successful
that from 1941 to 1947 Eisen-
stein worked on his masterpiece
" Ivan the Terrible."
Ivan was to have been in three
parts, but the third was never
filmed. Part I (finished in 1945)
is largely a chronicle of history :
it was a great success and earned
Eisenstein the Order of Lenin.
Part II is a more personal story
of Ivan as a man with doubts
and fears, an insight into the
mind of a powerful ruler. The
action concerns the Boyars' plot
to usurp Ivan. The film was not
approved for ideological reasons,
and was refused exhibition until
ten years after Eisensteins' death
in 1948.
In "The Boyars' Plot"
sound and colour (in the banquet
scene) are used as media for ex-
pression in a way that has not
been bettered to this day. " It is
a thrilling film, showing Eisen-
stein at the height of his powers,
a film artist in unequalled control
of his medium."
Come and see it on November
22nd.
