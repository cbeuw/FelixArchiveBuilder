Tye, already looking a fool,
makes himself look even more
foolish by telling the world how
he forgot to lock his door one
night. R. C. S. Union remains
apathetic, though beery. Schrpter
continues to churn out the same
old stuff, old ideas, weak Union
meetings, even an article almost
identical to that of the last two
Presidents of Guilds. Guilds
Union remains complacent and
beery. Beer, in fact, continues to
be the backbone of the constitu-
ent college unions. These organ-
isations provide the training
ground, where freshers can gain
experience and mature, so that
they may later guide the greater
I.C. Union. The amusing thing
is, that while I.C. complains about
its present beery leaders, it is
busy training the next beery hier-
archy.
Mr. Frank Fuchs, that unsuc-
cessful, underbrained, short sight-
ed, inconsequential little man,
always seeks to raise himself to a
higher level by pulling down his
betters. Unfortunately his efforts
fail and he does not become a
bigshot. This irks his septic little
mind and he becomes spiteful and
vicious. However, he must be
given credit. He never stops trying
and we are now treated to his
latest labour "Comment." In
all fairness we must admit,
Frankie could not care less about
those unfortunate Irakis. His mo-
tives are to cause trouble for the
Embassy in Queens Gate. Let
everyone be warned not to take
his stirring lightly for there will
always be little men like he, who
crawl around and scheme below
the surface.

POWER
from our Studies Correspondent
Anthony Wedgwood Benn, La-
bour M.P. for Bristol South East
and one of the "Bright New
Image " men of the Labour Party
was here. Despite the inefficiency
of I.C. Socialist Club, the one time
Peer managed to find the lecture
theatre and introduced himself.
He climbed over the desk, sat on
it with his legs dangling, removed
his jacket and spoke. With an
ease and eloquency which must
be the envy of many a politician
he outlined the Labour Party's
policy to be, when . . . , if . . .
The talk contained a refreshing
lack of cliches, and I did not hear
a single " er."
After a passing reference to the
wave of de-stalinization now pro-
ceeding in the enemy's ranks he
said that Labour would not fight
the next Election on Miss Keeler,
or Lord Home, or the mistakes of
the Conservative Party. Labour's
greatest asset is the " new mood
of seriousness of intelligently
anxious people all over the^ coun-
try." This gives labour a chance
to fight an " upright intelligent
campaign with no gimmicks.'' . . .
The most important topic of
the talk was Land. The prices
are a scandal and directly affect
major projects such as Housing,
Transport, and City Planning. In
Sweden when they build a road
four-fifths of the money goes on
construction and one-fifth on land
purchase, in England it is exactly
the reverse.
When Labour comes to power
there are going to be some
changes around here. The Houses
of Parliament are inefficient. Be-

Last term an I.C. man went to
Q.M.C. posing as a reporter from
an African Magazine and got
details of their mascot, Mary.
(Q.M.C. did the same to us
during our carnival but found out
less). Also a successful charity
raid was carried out on trie Festi-
val Hall.
R.C.S. had organised to take
the spanner at the Guilds dinner
on Friday 25th, but Mines, got
there first. R.C.S. then decided
to have U.C.'s -Phineas instead,
and knowing where he was kept,
were able to walk in and take him
at 10 p.m. It was necessary to
force a door, but U.C. do not
appear to have complained about
this. Clues have been sent to
them and at present they are
hunting down Phineas._
«
On the following Monday even-
ing a large number of U.C. men
wandered around our Union,
taking nothing but a couple of
pairs of trousers.
Also, on the Monday, the
Wooden Horse Club heard that
Kings had Mary, and Q.M.C.
had King's Reggie, and that a
swap-off would take place. At
3.30 on Tuesday "Evening Stan-
sides, it does not seem right that
there are 600 people at the head,
of our society solely there by the
possession of a birth certificate.
The Civil Service — well. The
Legal System is irritatingly tra-
ditional and expensive as hell.
" Lords and Beefeaters " are not
really traditionally British, more
in keeping with this country's
tradition is T.W.3.
dard" reporters discovered the
swap was at 6.30 that evening.
Rapid organization, and as
Q.M.C's. dormobile headed home
from the swap it was surrounded
l>y cars and motorbikes. After
a scuffle Mary was removed.
Back at the Union, about 9
p.m., I.C. decided to go for
C.E.M's. owl. Oswald was ob-
tained by walking into their
nearly deserted Union and sawing
through the chains.
On Wednesday, we had a num-
ber of Visitors down at the tow-
path. U.C. made an attempt at
Jez's fire extinguisher. The name
plate was taken off the boat house
and the doors were nudged with
a Land Rover. C.E.M. were
present in small numbers. Mean-
while a mob visited the Union
and were shut out after a little
trouble.
C.E.M. objected strongly and
officially that :—
1. They had contracted out of
of Mascoting,
2. Oswald was taken out of
Union Hours.
3. A window was broken, a
chair ripped and the
chains damaged.
Watson put the responsibility onto
a spokesman of the Wooden
Horse Club, who came to an
agreement with a C.E.M. delega-
tion at Friday Lunchtime. Q.M.C.
did not object officially but com-
plained that a large amount of
damage was done to their dormo-
bile and that Mary was4aken out
of Union Hours.
