This is the Royal Air Force
The R.A.F. is one of the largest and
most complex organisations in, the
country. In every Branch the men
at the top must be leaders,
diplomats, planners, expert ad-
ministrators. They must be able to
assimilate facts and make swift
decisions. They must be men with
trained minds. Graduate minds.
The R.A.F. employs over 148,000
men and women; it is an organisa-
tion with its own barristers, doctors,
teachers, civil engineers, and its
own hospitals, schools, and colleges.
It has bases all over the world
and representativesin almost every
country—officers are on the staff of
most British embassies abroad. The
Service is the spearhead of many of
the most important technological
advances in"British aviation: the
advice and recommendations of
senior R.A.F. officers can affect
political and strategic decision at the
highest national and international
levels.
Special terms
of appointment for graduates
Joining the Service as a graduate
gives you special privileges: an
immediate commission and accele-
rated promotion. It also gives you
an excellent chance of reaching the
most senior ranks—many of the
Air Marshals on the active list are
graduates. Remember: very few
directorships in industry can match
the power or responsibility that is
given to the senior officer in the
R.A.F. In very few professions
could you fill such a wide variety of
interesting appointments—both in
Britain and abroad—on your way
to the top.

INDIAN AID
The Imperial College has
entered into a special relationship
with the Indian Institute of Tech-
nology (Delhi). The British Gov-
ernment, in collaboration with
British industry, has given sub-
stantial financial assistance to-
wards the new Institute's full
development.
The scheme will involve long-
term secondments of Imperial
College staff, training of Indian
staff at the College and short visits
to Delhi by senior College staff.
Academic assistance is already in
being.

GIRLS, GIRLS, GIRLS
From a Felix Reporter
There are about 125 girls at
I.C. It has been decided to in-
crease and possibly double this
number.
A committee is being formed to
find out how this can be done.
If you have a sensible idea
about this, give it to the President
of I.C.W.A., Katherine Tait, at
Beit Hall.
ZOO MAN
Last Tuesday, Mr. David At-
tenborough, the well known per-
sonality and qualified Zoologist,
succeeded in entertaining stu-
dents with a talk and film on
Madagascar.
He described the Island as a
unique enclave and mentioned
many amusing native legends. To
observe and film the island ani-
mals he plotted their daily routes
through the forest, built hides
and camouflaged photographic
equipment. He obtained unique
film sequences of lemurs, by
playing recordings of their voices
to attract attention and received
sharp warning calls in response.
He later remarked that the crea-
tures would probably have re-
sponded equally well to the Wil-
liam Tell Overture.
In conclusion he answered
questions, and the audience
showed their appreciation of such
a warm personality with tremen-
I dous applause.

from page 1
On being asked why this area
should not be used for parking
cars, as the scooter owners were
not quite so desperately short of
parking space as car-owners, he
replied rather (vaguely that the
College had not considered it
suitable.
Mr. C. Hingley said he thought
the road in front of the hostels
could be used to park one line
of cars—as it was lastyear— with-
out causing any inconvenience.
He was at once accused of wish-
ing to desecrate the beautiful out-
look of the halls. Mr. Hingley
defended his suggestion by point-
ing out that such a line of cars
would not be visible from any of
the bedrooms, and that apparently
it was not intended for the "beau-
tiful outlook " to be appreciated
from the ground floor lounges, as
the windows of these were draped
with heavy, vision-impeding net
curtains. Mr. Stevenson was not,
however, sufficiently impressed to
adopt the idea.
Various elaborate and expens-
ive schemes were put forward by
residents involving the building of
underground or multi storey car
parks. Mr. Stevenson made it
clear that all such propositions
were out of the question as the
government did not and would
not allow any money for the
building of car parks for students.
Thus, when the two new blocks of
hostels went up in Prince's Gar-
dens in two years' time the situa-
tion of the residents would be
much worse as the present car
park would have to disappear,
and instead of 30 spaces for 400
people there would be no places
at all for 1,200 people.
The position of the College as
a whole was also said to be des-
perate, as when the building pro-
gramme was complete, the num-
ber of parking spaces available
would be less than a third of the
anticipated number of cars.
