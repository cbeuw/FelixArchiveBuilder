COLOR PROBLEM
Sir,
I have a complaint about the college barber which I would like
to bring to the notice of other members of the Union through your
paper.
On the 1st of this month I went to see the barber to book an
appointment for a friend. He told me he would not make an appoint-
ment for my friend if he had hair like mine. (I am an African and
have curly hair.)
The implication of this is that those who have hair like mine
cannot avail themselves of a service provided in college. What is
more, as there is no announcement to warn us, we have to go to
the barber severally to face the indignity of being told that we have
hair of the wrong sort!
I feel strongly that any service provided under the auspices
of the Union should be available to all members. If the purveyor
of a service feels himself unable to perform it as fully as possible
he should immediately confess the fact and then be replaced by some-
one more versatile.
This whole incident is thrown into sharper relief by an encounter
I had with this same barber over a year ago. On that occasion I asked
him for information about purchasing a pair of clippers. He refused
to tell me because, as he said, I would use it to cut my friends' hair
and thereby threaten his livelihood. Therefore, one way and another,
people with my kind of hair are not supposed to have their hair cut.
Yours sincerely,
SAM APEH
(Zoo. P.G.)
Ed.—Complaints of this nature should be treated extremely
seriously by the Union. This paper will support fully any effort to
prevent such discrimination.

GET DRESSED!
Dear Sir,
I.C. needs a boost for budding
Beau-Brummels. This College has
a singular lack of elegance; rival-
led only perhaps by a coach out-
ing to Wigan or a minor agricul-
tural show, it is populated by
people who are content to drift in
dribs and drabs through an un-
spectacular and colourless higher
education.
To these students I would say,
let us try and bring some style to
this College; in clothes, manner-
isms and speech. If you come
to College; in a suit then let it be
a clean one with a quarter of an
inch of cuff showing; if you do
not possess a clean suit then come
in other garb but try and make it
fust a little bit startling and dif-
ferent. Of course there are many
who aspire to no more than dirty
jeans and sweaters, I have nothing
against this, but do make sure the
smuts on the jeans are placed in
a balanced way and in contrasting
colours. If you must have dirt
under your fingernails then try^
and make it dirt of an interesting
hue, something to match blood-
shot eyes perhaps.
Watch a group of Students
walking, standing, sitting or talk-
ing; hardly a pretty picture. Try
and look elegant when you are
relaxed, do not get hunched over
a newspaper in the Union lounges,
briefcases clutched in the lap or
by the edge of the chair; relax,
stretch, even yawn and do read
the Society columns.
Speech is where lack of ele-
gance is really shown up, I do not
refer to accents but to phraseo-
logy. English has become a
language of tinned cliches based
on a small number of overworked
words. Elegance of speech can
be brought into a conversation of
almost any intellectual level; try
calling your friends " A second
cousin to a Rhubarb Tree" or
" Horace Hotpot' instead of
" Spawry-Eyed * * * *;" even
try inventing a few words, their
use can bring startling results:...
Finality, do not neglect the
Social Graces, to extract a pearl
from the world you must know
how to open an Oyster.
So, fellow shadows, let us culti-
vate elegance and nurture colour
and movement, without of course
being affected; who knows? we
may rise to a strata unbounded
by mere test tubes, mine shafts
and spanners. The Debating So-
ciety might even flourish again.

Dear Mr. Combes,
I have just seen the last "Felix"
and noticed a pathetic letter from
" Pseudo" (whoever he likes to
think he is).
Many London Colleges are in
difficulties with their own small
publications, even "Sennet" finds
the going hard at times, so would
it not be more intelligent to give
up our small individual College
papers and in place of these make
"Sennet" a valuable and enter-
taining and UP TO THE MIN-
UTE newspaper? Similarly our
individual magazines
"FLEET" intends to incorporate
ALL COLLEGE magazines and
thus become the ONE big maga-
zine for the whole of the Univer-
sity. I think it is high time for
this. The largest and most active
Colleges are already putting all
the weight they can into this
scheme for a magazine of some
standing, I am confident the rest
will soon follow. We are most
eager to hear what you have to
say about this.
Yours sincerely,
S. PATRICIA WARD,
Editor of the University Magazine
ED.: —The above has been re-
ceived after a good deal of corre-
spondence emphasising the need
for a University Magazine and
encouraging contributions to
" FLEET."

Dear Sir,
Much of what was said on mas-
cots in the late news section of
last week's "Felix" was very true.
But it will need more than the
long overdue appearance of
Phoenix to replace the arrogant
superiority complex that passes
here for Union Spirit with some-
thing a little more genuine.
People have a limited amount
of participation spirit and while it
is channelled off into the generally
childish and parochial activities of
the constituent colleges the I.C.
Union inevitably suffers. The
"keen enthusiasm" and "rivalry"
referred to by Bob Schroter be-
tween R.C.S., Mines and Guilds
would serve for more purpose
Were it directed within the Uni-
versity. The myth of this being
too large and impersonal a unit is
tossed around without any at-
tempt at justification. It is just
not true\ A General Studies
lecture a week is no substitute for
a night at an L.S.E. bar social.
The exaggerated emphasis
placed in the constituent colleges
is reflected by the fact that we
have had to wait seven weeks
for the first I.C. Union meeting,
while two have already been and
gone in the internal unions.
SOj Mr. President; display
yourself more often please.
Yours faithfully,
CHRIS GOULD
Dear Sir,
For at least two years Phoenix
the Imperial College mascot has
lain neglected in the President's
office. Most students of I.C. have
never even seen him. Nearly all
other London colleges have mas-
cots on permanent display in their
Union buildings. A mascot is the
figurehead of a college and helps
to maintain that spirit which is so
essential for an active union.
Here at I.C. there is a great
college spirit within the three
constituent-colleges—spirit which
is fostered by the presence (or-
casional absence of Spanner,
Theta and Mitch. We feel how-
ever that I.C. spirit should also
be encouraged and that I.C.
should become more of a single
unit within U.L.U. This will be
helped if we, like the other Lon-
don colleges, have our mascot on
permanent display.
Yours sincerely,

The Editor,
" Felix."
Sir,
So you think that a headline
like " Maggi Was Here " is justi-
fied because " Felix " sells ?
Perhaps you think that Moo-
ney's eating houses are good
because everybody uses them. In
both cases, people patronise them
alternative. " Felix " sells in spite
of that sensationalist headline, not
because of it.
Yours faithfully,

lix " has sold out—twice.
Dear Sir,
Four Iraqi students studying in
Britain have had their grants
withdrawn for " non academic
reasons." These students include
Abdul Hodi of the Electrical En-
gineering Department of I.C.
Despite representations by the
Head of this Department, his
grant has not yet been restored.
On Wednesday last, the Cul-
tural Attache of the Iraqi Embas-
sy told us that he was trying to get
these grants restored, but so far
had been unsuccessful.
We ask that this Union send an
official letter of protest to the
Iraqi Embassy. Such a letter may
Strengthen the hand of the Cul-
tual Attadhe in dealing with the
authorities in Baghdad.

Sir,
I consider Counter Comment
to be a complete waste of space if
the author merely uses this col-
umn for personal insults and
irrelevant anecdotes. If he can-
not think of some intelligent
counter-comment, he should give
someone else the job.
Yours,
A. BELL
