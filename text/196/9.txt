FOLK SINGING
Due to the lethargy of Union machinery the
I.C, Folk Song Club w i l l not be formed with
o f f i c i a l status u n t i l at least next term.
Since the meeting of 31st. Oct. 60 sig-
natures have been obtained, and these are
being posted on the Council noticeboard to-
gether with details of the aims of the club.

Club,' w i l l function as i f already approved
by RCC so far a s an utter, lack of funds
allows. U n t i l receiving recognition from
the Union i t cannot obtain any grant or .
charge membership fees. Despite this the
club hopes to arrange at least one hoot-
enanny this term.
One folk-group, the Wayfarers, has
been operating for some weeks, A second
specialising i n 'Blues' i s now being
formed. Practices are being held i n
Committee Room B ( n e x t to the Bar ),

Botany lecture theatre (Room B4.) on Thurs.
14th. Nov. at 12,4.5 to discuss plans for t
the year and to elect acting club o f f i c i a l s .
The music of this club i s bound to be
dominated by B r i t i s h and American folk
music. But a special plea i s being made to
overseas students to join and so by l i v e
performances or records give members the
opportunity to appreciate folk music of
other lands.

be the cheapest of the year at IC, Dance

FRENCH STICKS - •
Last Friday night as the scene of the
Selkirk Hall party was .changing from the
Dining Lounge to the H a l l , one of,the l i f t s
in which residents and guests were comm-
uting got stuck i n i t s shaft just below
Selkirk gallery l e v e l . Eventually, a key
was found to open the shaft doors and a l
allow one intrepid gentleman to lower
himself onto the l i f t - roofand open the
trap door so providing means of escape for
the occupants. From their dark prison
emerged TEN human beings and SEVEN long
French loaves.
(Too. many, loaves-had been bought, so
they were given away free at the end of
the party).
