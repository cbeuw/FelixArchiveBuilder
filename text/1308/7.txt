PUBLIC HEALTH WHITE PAPER SPECIAL
How smoking is about to be officially made ‘antisocial’
The Government’s plan to ban smoking in public places is one of the measures in the white paper.
Tom Simonite considers the evidence on passive smoking
Not content with curtailing
the possibility of enjoying
the stereotypically hedon-
istic ‘student lifestyle’ by
introducing top-up fees, the
Government has upped the
ante with the recent white
paper on public health.
Everything necessary to the
true student has been found
wanting – drinking, greasy
takeaways, the occasional or
perhaps frequent fag smoke
and sex with people who don’t
know their VD from their KY
due to bad sex education.
OK, maybe not the last one,
and who will listen to all this
‘advice’ anyway? Actually,
when it comes to smoking,
the Government has decided
to go beyond providing handy
tips on cigarette packets. The
dramatic measures suggest-
ed make this part of the paper
stand well out from the rest.
Duetoscientificevidenceon
the dangers of second-hand
smoke, workplaces and most
public places will be smoke-
free by 2008. Exceptions have
been made for pubs that do
not serve ‘prepared’ food, and
private members clubs where
the membership wish to allow
smoking.
The Government’s ann-
ouncement of its intention
to ban smoking is the lat-
est in a slow-burning bat-
tle that science seemed to
have wrapped up long ago.
The dangers of smoking to
the smoker, particularly the
greatly increased risk of lung
cancer, have been highlighted
by various researchers for
around 50 years. Evidence of
the dangers of passive smok-
ing has been slower to arrive.
A major reason for this is
the difficulty of such studies,
becausesomanyotherfactors
must be taken into account.
There is much complexity in
the science behind hard-hit-
ting headlines like “passive
smoking kills one bar worker
a week”. This study was car-
ried out here at Imperial by
Konrad Jamrozik, who was a
professor of primary care epi-
demiology until earlier this
year. He used two massive
datasets to make estimates
of the number of deaths in
the UK each year from pas-
sive smoking. Records of
all deaths in 2002 from lung
cancer, ischaemic heart dis-
ease and stroke in Britons
under 65, and on exposure to
second-hand smoke at home
and work, were compared.
Previous studies provided
information on the risks of dis-
ease faced by smokers, non-
smokers and those exposed
to other people’s smoke.
Combining these sets of data
and subsequent calculations
gave Jamrozik those dramat-
ic figures – 3600 deaths a year
caused by passive smoking,
700 due to workplace smoke,
49 of them in hospitality.
Taken as a whole, epidemio-
logical work on the risks of
passive smoking is convinc-
ing. But the way that the sci-
ence of these studies works is
found unconvincing by many
when presented in the media.
Such work is (easily) criti-
cised for layering together
multiple ‘estimates’ of risk.
Pressure groups against a
crackdown on smoking quick-
ly point this out, dismissing
anything so tentative as an
estimate and balking at the
mention of ‘calculations’ or
‘projections’. “Show us con-
crete proof that passive smok-
ing has these effects,” they
demand. Unfortunately, none
is likely to materialise unless
large numbers of people can
be persuaded to sit in care-
fully controlled but smoky
conditions for long periods.
The reception given to
claims about risks associat-
ed with passive smoking is a
good example of the problems
with presenting research that
produces ‘risk factors’. Such
studies are typically pre-
sented in the press as infor-
mation upon which readers
are expected to act to reduce
their risk. Unfortunately it’s
difficult to relate to these per-
centages, and an examination
at how they are produced by
scientists reveals methodolo-
gy that can appear to be some
way removed from ‘fact’.
One of the most interesting
features of the debate that
continues to trail in the wake
of the decisions on smoking
has been the way that the
scientific side, with all its
percentages, has been down-
played. The focus has instead
been on issues of choice and
liberty. Are smokers entitled
to smoke where and when
they like? Are others entitled
to go where they like and not
encounter a smoky fog?
The dramatic figures pro-
vided by the work of Konrad
Jamrozik and others have
rarely been invoked; more
frequently discussion is about
whether we live in a nanny
state. From the point of view
of the science, this seems
strange; shouldn’t the discus-
sion focus on the fact that
smokers are damaging the
health of those around them?
Using traffic lights to change the way you eat
The new legislation will try to tackle the obesity epidemic as well as other health issues.
Rosie Taylor explains how the Government plans to make the fat boys and girls slim
On 16 November, the Health
Secretary John Reid pub-
lished Choosing Health, the
Government’s public health
White Paper.
The document sets out the
Government’s plans to make
it easier for people to change
their lifestyle so they eat
more healthily, exercise more
and smoke less. It also sets
out moves to improve sexual
health, encourage sensible
drinking and improve mental
wellbeing.
The strategies for action
are, says the Government,
based on the principles of
informed choice, personalised
services and collaboration
between the Government, the
NHS, industry and wider soci-
ety. It identifies how, given
better information and sup-
port, people can be empow-
ered to make healthy lifestyle
choices.
When it comes to the health
of children, the Government
feels that it has a special
responsibility, along with fam-
ilies and schools. So in addi-
tion to better information and
support, it has set out new
standards for food in schools,
promotion of physical activity
and education on nutrition.
The changes aim to place
health promotion at the heart
of the NHS. This involves a
big change in attitude, among
NHS staff and the public, in
helping people choose health-
ier lifestyles and giving them
greater control over their
health.
Since treating ill health
related to poor diet costs the
NHS an estimated £4bn each
year, this white paper was
no doubt inspired as much
by fears about the costs to
the NHS of current trends
in ill health, highlighted in
the Treasury-commissioned
Wanless report earlier this
year, as by any desire to
improve health for its own
sake.
A cornerstone in facili-
tating the public to make
healthier food choices is the
Government’s plans to intro-
duce, by mid-2005, a colour-
coded system of food label-
ling. Presently, The Foods
Standards Agency (FSA) is
developing a ‘traffic light sys-
tem’ to code food.
Gill Fine, Director of
Consumer Choice and
Dietary Health at the FSA,
said: “People have told us
they want to make healthier
food choices and that they
would welcome signposting
to help them.”
This labelling system will
build on the nutrient criteria
for the ‘5 A DAY’ logo already
in use. The ‘5 A DAY’ logo sys-
tem will be developed further
as the Government works
with retailers, caterers, man-
ufacturers and producers to
promote the ‘five portions or
fruit and vegetables a day’
message. The average intake
of fruit and vegetables in the
UK is just 2.8 portions a day,
well below the recommended
intake. Consuming at least
five portions of fruit and
vegetables a day can reduce
the risk from heart disease,
stroke and cancer by up to
20%.
The Government also plans
to introduce clear labelling
of the nutritional content of
food, and the FSA has com-
missioned research to devel-
op a scheme to categorise
foods on the basis of the nutri-
ents they contain.
The Government, in collab-
oration with the food industry,
aims to identify methods to
reduce levels of salt, added
sugars and fat, initially on a
voluntary basis. These areas
are being targeted in light
of the strong evidence on
their damaging effects on
health. An estimated one in
three deaths from cancer and
coronary heart disease are
attributable to poor diet. A
reduction in the salt intake of
the population from the cur-
rent average of 9g to 6g per
day would result in an esti-
mated reduced incidence of
coronary heart disease by 6%,
stroke by 15%, and high blood
pressure by 17%. Reducing
fat intake, particularly satu-
rated fat, can help lower the
risk of coronary heart disease
and some cancers.
New ‘NHS health trainers’
who have been dubbed ‘NHS
lifestyle coaches’, will be
introduced in 2006 to advise
anyone who wants to live
a more healthy life. These
trainers will be equipped to
provide individualised advice
on a range of aspects includ-
ing how people can become
more active. The Government
hopes that by creating thou-
sands more miles of cycle
paths, organising walking ini-
tiatives and easing access to
sports facilities, the trend of
dramatically decreasing rates
of physical activity in the last
25 years will be reversed as
people become more active.
The Government has
also suggested a voluntary
restriction on all advertising,
promotion and sponsorship of
unhealthy foods and drinks
before 9pm, to minimise
children’s exposure to these
influences.
Social inequalities in health
exist, with those in lower
social classes eating around
half the fruit and vegetables
of people from professional
groups, and higher levels of
obesity in the lower social
classes. This social inequal-
ity underlies almost all pub-
lic health concerns, and the
Government plans to imple-
ment a range of measures to
tackle these.
Additional funding will be
given to Primary Care Trusts
(PCTs) in deprived areas to
tackle health inequalities
and improve health. This will
involve joint action by local
authorities with business
and voluntary groups. From
2006, people living in deprived
areas will be encouraged to
use a ‘personal health kit’
with support from their doctor
and health trainer to improve
their health.
