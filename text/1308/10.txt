Last week’s article, ‘Animal testing:
a necessary or unnecessary evil’,
provides some useful information
but, as usual, sees the issue from a
myopic human perspective.
Animal testing and factory farm-
ing are just examples of our arro-
gance as human beings. We, for
some nonsensical reason, declared
ourselves the rulers of the Earth
and therefore empowered ourselves
with the choice of who lives and who
is dispensable, of what is useful and
what is not.
Perhaps religion is partly to blame
for the misconception that the Earth
was made for man. This attitude
is largely responsible for the envi-
ronmental problems we face today,
as everything on Earth is assigned
a value according to our ‘needs’
and wants, despite our incapability
to fully comprehend the complexity
and beauty of nature. It is this same
attitude that led us to conclude that
humans are more important than
other species and therefore it is
alright for us to use them as test
samples.
The article talks about intrinsic
value. Do humans really have more
‘intrinsic value’? Intrinsic value to
whom? As far as I am concerned,
the biggest danger that faces me
is the human being. Perhaps the
atrocities committed in the last
century, those that continue to be
committed today even by ‘civilised’
westerners, the slow and steady
destruction of my habitat and more
explain why.
The fact that humans have col-
lectively created enough weap-
ons to destroy themselves 10 to 15
times over says something. On the
contrary, the contribution of other
species to the world we live in is
immeasurable. Each living being,
from the bees that pollinate our
crops to the trees that clean the
air, form an integral part of the eco-
system without which there would
be no ‘us’. Humans, on the other
hand, have done nothing but pro-
gressively destroy the environment,
which is perhaps more important
than anything. It is all that we leave
behind that is of any real impor-
tance. Without it, there can be noth-
ing, no ‘us’ and no ‘them’.
The fact that we even have to ask
whether animal testing is traumatic
for animals and whether they feel
much astounds me. It is common
knowledge, and frankly open for eve-
ryone to observe, that other species
have very strong bonds with their
species and with nature, perhaps
stronger than humans. They cer-
tainly don’t make enemies as easily
as we do. Also, their sensory powers
are usually stronger than those of
humans and they would therefore
be adversely effected by an artificial
laboratory environment. If you add
to this the fact that they have no
idea of what is being done to them
or why, it makes you feel rather sick
inside.
As far as alternatives are con-
cerned, just test the products on
humans. Human testing is neces-
sary before a drug enters the mar-
ket anyway; it is just cheaper, easier
and quicker to test drugs on animals
first. The introduction of in vitro
studies is perhaps another option.
So what if we have to wait a bit
longer? Maybe if drug companies
like GlaxoSmithKline spent more
time on useful drugs than on bogus
fashionable drugs like Seroxat we
would have more progress.
Perhaps this is stretching it, but is
it not the same kind of indifference
we show towards animals who don’t
look or talk or act like us that we
show towards tens of thousands of
people dying in a foreign land whose
suffering is so easily put at the back
of our minds? But when a compara-
tively insignificant number of our
‘own’ people die, we make a whole
lot of noise. How much will it take
for us to start thinking and feeling?
Show mercy to animals?
Who are we to decide?
Veer Singh responds to last week’s Felix Science article on animal testing
By Dave Arquati
My last article was about transport
problems. This time, I’m writing
about some changes.
The first change could affect every
single student and staff member at
Imperial’s South Kensington cam-
pus. All London-based readers will
know about the congestion charge,
where motorists £5 per weekday to
drive within a zone covering most of
central London. The current west-
ern boundary runs down Edgware
Road and Park Lane, but there are
proposals to extend the zone to
Earl’s Court, putting Imperial inside
the charging zone.
This has local businesses con-
cerned about a decrease in passing
trade. The only consolation for them
at the moment is that studies of the
central charging zone have indicat-
ed that, overall, there has only been
a small effect on businesses.
But what does it mean for
Imperial? Well, anyone driving a
car to College would face a hefty
bill. However, I doubt that applies
to most people, as Imperial staff
and students tend to walk, cycle, or
catch the bus or tube.
If you use the tube, the proposed
extension probably wouldn’t affect
you much, since the expected
number of extra passengers is very
small. However, there’s good news
for everyone else. Pedestrians and
cyclists should experience a more
pleasant environment as traffic vol-
umes would decrease. Bus users
would probably see the biggest
benefits – reduced journey times
thanks to reduced traffic, and high-
er frequencies and more routes as
a result of the money made from
charging (estimated to be an extra
£10m).
Speaking of buses, you may have
noticed the iconic old Routemaster
buses going the way of the dodo.
They are being replaced by more
modern low floor buses, partly to
comply with new regulations on
access for the disabled.
This means the retirement of the
Routemaster in favour of modern
double deckers or bendy buses. This
has been very unpopular, especially
given the spontaneous combustion
of some bendy buses a few months
ago. However, resistance seems to
be futile, and the replacement of
Routemasters on route 19 through
Chelsea has been announced for
April. All other Routemaster-oper-
ated routes are on death row, but
many will be pleased that no execu-
tion date has been announced for
South Kensington’s route 14 yet.
My final word this time is on
Oyster. Many of you use it, and, this
being Imperial, some of you may
even have wondered how it works.
Basically, an Oyster reader induces
a response in a card by using a
certain radio frequency. What you
may not have realised is that infor-
mation on your season ticket or pre-
pay, and on the recent journeys you
have made, is stored on the card
itself. This is the only way it can
work on buses, which aren’t con-
nected to a central network except
at depots.
Starting next year, for pre-pay
users, this journey information
will be used in a system known as
‘capping’, where you will only be
charged up to a maximum daily fare.
For example, if the cost of your bus
journeys in a day exceeds the price
of a bus pass, the amount you pay
will be capped at the cost of the bus
pass. It will work the same way for
travelcards.
However, it won’t be so easy to
work out yourself – next year, there
will be different bus fares for the
morning peak, and lower tube fares
in very early mornings, at evenings
and at weekends. You’ll just have to
“trust thy Oyster”.
