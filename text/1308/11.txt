All it takes is a small change of
habit. It’s not hard. In fact, many of
you will find it common sense. When
you want to buy chocolate, coffee,
tea, muesli etc, make sure that you
buy the Fairtrade option.
That’s it. No more thought
required, no more effort on your
part. Get into that habit and you can
support a hugely important cam-
paign having a wide-ranging impact
upon third world farmers and their
families.
Fairtrade is a simple idea, but with
far-reaching consequences. When
you buy normal coffee, the farmer
who grew the coffee beans gets only
a small fraction of what you pay. At
the moment, a non-Fairtrade cof-
fee farmer can expect to receive
about £38 per 45kg bag of green
coffee beans, whereas a farmer
who is a member of the Fairtrade
Organisation can expect about £68
per bag. A huge difference, you will
agree.
Farmers join into cooperatives
and sell directly to the supplier,
effectively cutting out the middle-
man and greatly increasing the
price they receive for their produce.
This enables them to negotiate a
fair price for their goods, which
guarantees them a sustainable liv-
ing and the support to develop their
businesses.
When you buy goods with the
Fairtrade logo on, you know that a
good proportion of the price you pay
will go directly to the producers.
The main issue now is creat-
ing a demand for Fairtrade goods.
Fairtrade is the fastest growing
segment of the UK coffee market,
but there is still so far to go. By
asking for the Fairtrade option next
time you wander into Costa, you
show your support for an ethical
cuppa and put pressure on the cof-
fee companies to move to Fairtrade
status.
As well as buying Fairtrade pro-
duce, there is more than can be
done to raise awareness and show
support for the Fairtrade Movement.
Thereisacampaignstartingoncam-
pus to make Imperial a Fairtrade
University.
A Fairtrade University is one
that meets the five criteria set out
below:
● First, the students’ union and
college create a Fairtrade policy
incorporating the five aims
● Fairtrade foods are sold in all
shops, cafés, restaurants and bars
on campus. Where this isn’t possi-
ble, there is a commitment to begin
using Fairtrade foods as soon as
possible
● Fairtrade foods (such as coffee
and tea) are served at all meet-
ings hosted by the College and the
Union
● There is a commitment to cam-
paign for increased consumption of
Fairtrade goods on campus
● A Fairtrade Steering Group is
established, consisting of represent-
atives from catering, the College,
the Union executive, an appropriate
students’ union society and each
associated institution.
Once these five aims have been
realised, the Steering Group is
responsible for sending a report to
the Fairtrade Foundation for status
to be awarded.
Not only would Fairtrade
University status increase the levels
of ethical consumption at Imperial
and raise awareness of the issue,
but it would help to establish the
habit of Fairtrade purchasing in
generations of young student con-
sumers. It would set an example to
other universities and gain Imperial
the reputation of a university with a
world view, able to look beyond the
often insular world of science and
the dubious clutches of the City.
There is a College Catering
Review at the start of next term,
which will provide an ideal opportu-
nity to change policy for the better.
A petition will be starting next week
around campus to support Fairtrade
status. Please sign it.
In conjunction with the Chaplaincy,
a stall will be up around campus pro-
viding more information, and tast-
ers of Fairtrade goods and Fairtrade
events around London will be adver-
tised. The campaign is in its early
stages, so if you would like to give
your support, please send an email to
imperialfairtrade-subscribe
@yahoogroups.co.uk to join the
mailing list.
Even just an hour of your time to
help with the petition will make a
difference.
And finally, there is a Fairtrade
Fair on 3 and 4 December at the
Emmanuel Centre in Westminster.
This will be a great opportunity for
ethical Christmas present buying
and to show that Christmas really
does mean thinking about others, if
you’ll forgive the cheesy line.
Fairtrade: what’s it all about?
Imperial should become a Fairtrade University as soon as possible, says Jamie Brothwell
No-one can have failed to have
noticed the increase in recycling
facilities being offered to household-
ers by their local councils. Orange
sacks, green bags, black crates,
green bins – a multicoloured cor-
nucopia of waste disposal alter-
natives on your doorstep. There
is even a newspaper bin outside
South Kensington tube station! And,
of course, there is a Government
campaign to get us all recycling.
But why this sudden interest in
‘waste’ and how does it affect life at
Imperial?
You don’t have to be au fait with
environmental legislation to real-
ise that things are afoot in the
world of waste. The EU-initiated
Landfill Directive requires increas-
ing amounts of waste to be diverted
away from landfill disposal, and new
legislation affecting individual waste
streams will soon be implemented.
For example, the Waste Electrical
and Electronic Equipment (WEEE)
Directive will require the separate
collection and treatment of all elec-
trical equipment before disposal – or
else fines will be issued if targets
are not met. And this is just the
beginning. Waste management can
be expected to become increasingly
more demanding, and conventional
disposal to that hole in the ground
increasingly costly. This will place
an extra demand on any business
budget.
There is a burgeoning market for
recyclables – a ready raw material
in a world of rapidly declining virgin
raw materials. Some even pay for
our unwanted materials! One used
aluminium can has a resale value
of 0.5p, whilst the market for used
office quality paper is also consider-
able. New markets are also open-
ing up for plastics and glass, and
it wouldn’t be surprising if funding
was to become available for more
intensive work in this field!
Of course, recycling waste prod-
ucts should not be viewed solely
from the legislative/economic per-
spective, or as a potential resource
of research funding. The UK has
seen a steady increase in the amount
of municipal waste produced annu-
ally, despite disposal concerns. By
reducing the amount we dispose in
the general refuse bin, preferably
through minimising the waste we
produce or alternatively by reusing
or recycling that which is produced,
we reduce resource dissipation and
diminish the ‘ecological footprint’
we leave.
So, where are the recycling facili-
ties at Imperial – a centre of excel-
lence for environmental research?
That’s the question an increasing
number of people, both staff and
students, are beginning to ask. As
an institution at the cutting edge of
a number of scientific disciplines,
Imperial would be expected to be
the first to adopt measures aimed at
reducing environmental impact. Yet
there seems to be some reluctance
to assume a ‘green’ attitude.
It would be unfair to state that
Imperial has made no attempt
to divert waste away from land-
fill. There is a white paper recy-
cling scheme operated at South
Kensington, and the College has
provided glass and can collection
points at Beit and Southside. Some
departments and buildings have
chosen to operate their own recy-
cling programme, usually through
a separate collection of white paper.
Cardboard is also separately col-
lected for recycling and a battery
collection scheme is being devel-
oped. There have also been occa-
sional attempts in places to improve
overall environmental performance,
as demonstrated by the occasion-
al energy efficiency sticker placed
near a light switch! However, there
is no comprehensive College-wide
scheme, nor does one look likely in
the immediate future.
One department, the Department
of Environmental Sciences, is initi-
ating a pilot scheme for the collec-
tion of recyclables such as paper,
cans, glass, plastic, batteries, card-
board and printer toners. They are
also raising environmental aware-
ness in general and are attempt-
ing to promote a culture of envi-
ronmental conscientiousness. Not
only are they aiming to inculcate an
ideology of ‘reduce, reuse, recycle’,
but a goal is to encourage general
environmentalism: don’t leave lights
on, print on both sides of the paper,
re-use your cup...
Such general awareness is also
important in the context of the pilot
recycling scheme. For it to work,
it requires everyone to participate
and be aware of what can (and can-
not) be disposed. For instance, a
coke can thrown into a plastic-only
bin spoils a collection and leads to
landfill disposal of the whole load,
as has happened with the Beit and
Southside bins. Using the right
bin is crucial to any recycling
project. If the department’s pilot
is successful and creates enough
interest across the College, perhaps
encouragement for a wider scheme
can be generated.
As a rapidly acquisitive society,
the UK has little time for waste
issues. All this will have to change
due to environmental contamina-
tion concerns and pressure from the
EU, a change that is well overdue.
Wouldn’t it be better for Imperial
to be at the vanguard of this waste
revolution rather than be left behind
with hefty fines and a poor record
in corporate environmental respon-
sibility?
Bring on the bins
Rebecca Slack argues that Imperial College should be at the forefront of a revolution in waste disposal
