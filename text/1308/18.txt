Felix: How come you’re in New
York at the moment?
Steve: I’m at the end of my Americas
tour at the moment. I started in
Canada and worked my way down
America to Mexico. I’m currently
building up for my final gig where
I’m doing a ten hour set with Danny
Tenaglia [for the MADE Event and
Be Yourself party at the club Roxy,
in New York]. It’s been really hectic
recently.
How do you think the London
club scene compares to the
rest of the world?
I don’t really get much time in
London except at my own night,
Harlem Nights at The End. Although
it’s one of the smallest parties I play
it’s the one I’m the most proud of. I
built that night up myself and it is
one of my favourites to play. There is
a regular crowd, it’s steady and it’s a
good night.
Do you enjoy your marathon
sets there?
Long sets are good when there’s a
good vibe. When the music’s great
and the crowd’s loving it, you are at
the helm of that and I could play for
15 hours if the night was going well!
When you’re not DJing, how
do you chill out?
I love movies and directors, and I
chill out by drawing the curtains
and taking some time to myself with
a film and a smoke. When I’m not
doing that, I’m in the studio mak-
ing songs. I recently remixed Dido’s
Sand In My Shoes and it’s currently
number one in the US Billboard
Dance Chart. I also recently
remixed the club anthem I Can’t
Explain by Bombdog. It was tough
to remix because it was such a big
original. I supported it and played
it lots though so I wanted to remix
it.
What are your best memories
of a night spent in London?
There have been a couple of good
ones this year: there was a night in
October this year which was phe-
nomenal with 300 people still try-
ing to get in at 3am! It was crazy!
Another good night was the second
birthday of Harlem Nights which
was an awesome party. I play to
crowds of 1000 to 20,000 people but
the best nights are the ones where
the crowd are really into the music,
which is why I love doing Harlem
Nights.
Do you have any ‘insider tips’
for clubbers at the moment?
Argentina definitely has the best
crowd reaction; they really know
how to party there. Another of my
favourite places is Romania, on the
Black Sea Coast – there is a great
crowd and an awesome sound sys-
tem.
So how do you usually get
around to all these places?
Well I’m based mainly in Miami,
Ibiza and Birmingham and travel-
ling between places is tough. I live
in Ibiza during the summer months
and have a house in Birmingham.
Even though I make about four
flights a week, I really don’t like fly-
ing. Airports are terrible places.
So in an ideal world how would
you like to get around?
Teleport! One minute you could be in
Rome, then America, and then India
at the touch of a button! More seri-
ously, private jets are best because
you can even smoke on board.
Ok, some quick fire questions
now: sightseeing or the arts?
Sightseeing, definitely.
Chinese or curry?
Chinese
Haagen Dazs or Ben & Jer-
ry’s?
Haagen Dazs
If you see street performers,
do you stop and watch or walk
on by?
Stop and watch! There are lots of
street performers in New York.
And finally, do you have any
tips for students who want to
get into DJing?
There are two things you can do,
the first is get into production. If you
make good tracks, people will listen.
A good example is Nick Fantuli – he
produced a lot of good music and
eventually had to be recognised as
a good DJ with all of the support he
had.
The second way is to run your own
night that survives on the strength
of itself, not DJs you bring in –
something that is a good party in its
own right.
