The almost 1000-year-old
so called ‘New’ Forest was
the destination for the latest
Fellwanderers trip.
Its close proximity to
London, and the fact that our
driver, Alex, used to live there,
ensured a happily uneventful
trip down. In fact, we arrived
in plenty of time for dinner
at a rather fine pub/restau-
rant, the name of which I
can’t remember. We dined on
pheasant, oxtail and all man-
ner of tasty things. Alex even
had time to pop home and say
hi to his folks.
Feeling nicely nourished,
we set off to find the camp
site, a task that proved too
challenging for the combined
efforts of the thirteen youth-
ful pairs of eyes in the mini-
bus. We twice drove past a
rather large sign, with the
word ‘CAMPING’ clearly
emblazoned on it, and only
managed to find it after park-
ing almost directly in front of
it and telephoning the owner,
who helpfully came outside
and waved at us.
After that excellent demon-
stration of our navigational
skills, we pitched our tents
and admired the wonderful
view of the stars.
On Saturday we awoke to
find frost on our tents. Well,
I say ‘awoke’ – that implies
that some amount of sleep-
ing was done... That oh-so-
wonderful view of the stars,
due to the total lack of cloud
cover, meant that the night
was rather chilly.
We ate breakfast under a
clearsky,anxioustosetoffand
warm our cold feet. Walking
straight from the camp site,
we made good progress
thanks to good paths and
the almost total lack of hills.
The New Forest seemed to
be teeming with life: we saw
free roaming horses, ponies,
horses with riders, pigs, deer,
donkeys, dogs, pheasants and
grouse.
We arrived back quite early,
allowing for plenty of time to
sit in the pub before dinner.
This time we opted out of the
posh food, discovering that
the bar menu was half the
price for bigger portions.
We all slept much better on
Saturday night. Prepared for
the cold, we all wrapped up
warm with plenty of lay-
ers of clothing. Next morn-
ing, Oliver’s fantastic pen-
knife thermometer read two
degrees celsius.
Setting off, we encoun-
tered an impressively wob-
bly bridge, a very unimpres-
sive castle (it was just a lump
of earth), and more horses.
There was a brief moment of
excitement when we thought
we’d lost Joana and Evelyne.
The remains of a Roman villa
turned out to be quite a disap-
pointment. It was closed, and
seemed to consist of nothing
more than a couple of tarpau-
lins draped across the ruins.
We arrived back in time for
everyone to have dinner at
their own homes before get-
ting some much-needed sleep
in more civilised tempera-
tures than those encountered
over the weekend.
Trees, horses and tents
Imperial Fellwanderers explore the New Forest
By Victoria Pollock
Would you describe yourself
as a tolerant person? Or do
you have a limit to your toler-
ance? Do you, for example,
tolerate the policies of George
W Bush? What about Islamic
terrorism? Or people with
strong moral convictions?
Would you go so far as to say
that you even tolerate intoler-
ance? Surely this is a paradox
– we can’t be intolerant of
intolerance? Or can we?
The idea of “tolerance”
has several meanings in the
English language, but the
definition I would like to con-
sider is this: tolerance is “the
capacity for or the practice
of recognising or respecting
the beliefs or practices of oth-
ers”. Conversely, in Webster’s
Revised Unabridged
Dictionary, intolerance is
“refusal to allow to others the
enjoyment of their opinions,
chosen modes of worship,
and the like”.
It strikes me that, by the
very meaning of the word,
we can’t ‘tolerate’ anyone
unless we disagree with
them to begin with. We like
and respect those who share
our opinions and beliefs
– there’s nothing to put up
with. Disagreement is in fact
essential to tolerance.
This creates an interesting
paradox. Our society tolerates
most behaviour today, but not
differing beliefs about those
behaviours. If I disagree with
someone or something, I am
accused of being intolerant
– yet this is what I need to do
in order to exercise tolerance
in the first instance.
Much of the demand for
tolerance today is driven
by the fact that society at
large believes nothing and
is uncomfortable with those
who have strong convictions.
As such, people often confuse
intolerance with confident
belief in an absolute truth.
In fact, it is strong convic-
tions and principles applying
to humanity as a whole that
society finds uncomfortable.
It is towards these beliefs,
and those who hold them,
that our all-tolerant society is
most intolerant.
Many people see intoler-
ance as synonymous with
judging others. The tolerant
person today is completely
impartial: no judgments are
allowed. In post-modernism,
where there is no absolute
truth, each person takes a
neutral position on the con-
victions of others. Yet taking
this to extremes means that
everyone else is expected to
hold the same neutral ground
and no-one can take a stance
that says others are wrong
in any way. Therefore, trying
to encompass such a wide
array of ideas actually results
in intolerance of anything
that is different! Political phi-
losopher Michael Oakeshott
summed this up when he said
that we were a very toler-
ant people until we started to
pursue tolerance as a definite
objective.
One obvious example of this
was when the French secu-
lar tradition was confirmed
by legislation which banned,
in the words of President
Jacques Chirac, any “osten-
tatious signs of religious
proselytism, whatever the
religion”. This led to anger
from, among many others,
leaders of the Muslim, Jewish
and Christian faiths.
Even Christmas must now
be ‘tolerant-friendly’. It was
reported recently that the
Eden Project in Cornwall had
banned the word ‘Christmas’
– somewhat ironically for
something that takes its
name from the biblical
account of creation. Although
their marketing manager
has responded saying, “Eden
loves Christmas”, their ‘Time
of Gifts’ is designed to recog-
nise all mid-winter festivals
and be tolerant of everyone.
However, in trying not to
offend anyone, they in fact
offend many Christians of this
country, for whom Christmas
is a very precious and special
occasion. It is amazing – and
for Christians, very sad – how
unpopular the name of Jesus
Christ has become.
Although we have no record
of the actual date of His birth,
many Christians around the
world observe December 25
in honour of the birth of Jesus.
Various traditions and images
associated with Christmas,
such as food, songs, gifts,
stars and angels, originate
from the earliest celebration
of this event. Of course, the
real issue is not the festi-
val itself – Christianity is not
about festivals – most people
can easily tolerate Christmas
as an event. Rather, it is the
Christian belief in the signifi-
cance of Jesus, which we as
Christians keep at the front of
our minds, that people cannot
tolerate.
Christmas is the tradition-
al time for us to remember
a belief that affects every-
one, and we celebrate it with
particular and active inten-
sity at this time. This belief
is that that Jesus was God’s
supreme gift to the world.
The world had been waiting
for the promised Messiah – its
Saviour and King. Christians
believe that Jesus was that
person. He has come and is
the unique Son of God.
So, would you be toler-
ant towards Jesus? If you
want to know more about
Jesus’ exclusive claims and
worldwide rescue, there is
a fantastic opportunity for
you to do so on Thursday 9
December. This is the date of
our Carol Service. It is held
in the Main Dining Hall of
the Sherfield Building and
will start at 6.30pm. It is a
wonderful time and everyone
is welcome. There will be car-
ols, traditional and new, and
a short talk presenting the
significance of the message
of Christmas. Refreshments
will be provided and the
atmosphere will be informal
and relaxed. Contact cu@ic.
ac.uk for more details. Please
do come and join us: we are
looking forward to meeting
you there.
“. . . now we have heard for
ourselves, and we know that
this man really is the Saviour
of the World”
[John 4:42b]
Would you tolerate Jesus Christ if He was on earth today?
Christmas and the paradox of intolerance
CHRISTIAN UNION
By Marnie Chesterton
Take one large venue with a
free bar. Add the glitterati of
the radio world: Jo Whiley,
Steve Lamacq, Colin Murray.
Add several hundred over-
excited students from around
the UK, and you have the
Student Radio Awards.
The event took place last
Friday night at the Shepherds
Bush Pavilion in London. All
the big music radio stations
were represented in a cer-
emony designed to work up
a frenzied atmosphere. Steve
Lamacq and Jo Whiley recre-
ated their partnership from
Radio 1’s Evening Session
as they hosted an evening of
glitz and awards.
So why do you care? Well,
our very own IC Radio was
nominated within the cate-
gory of Best Talk and News
Show. Three of us who
made the shortlisted show,
Mission Impossible, were
there and by the time our
category came round, I had
my heart in my throat and my
acceptance speech all worked
out:
“I’d like to thank my par-
ents, my lawyer, Jesus and all
the ‘little people’ who made
this possible, (pause for
Gweneth Paltrow-style sob-
bing fit). This means more
than you could ever realise...”
etc, until they cut the power
on the microphone.
“So, the nominations for
Best Talk and News Show,
sponsered by LBC.” Above
the stage, on the enormous
white screen, our name
flashed up, one of six short-
listed shows. The competition
included Cambridge, Leeds
and Sunderland, who all had
a large posse to cheer when
they were mentioned. In fact,
the din was so loud that it was
hard to hear the top three
being read out.
Suddenly I caught a snippet,
“and the silver award goes
to Mission Impossible...” We
cheered and hugged. Second.
Second’s not so bad. No
podium glory, but ‘award win-
ning show’ gets to go on the
CV.
One of the most impres-
sive aspects of the evening
was the quantity of radio
professionals who attend-
ed. I spoke to one of them
XFM’s John Kennedy, who
hosts the 11pm-1am slot. He
pointed out that student radio
provides an important link to
professional radio. “Everyone
is here tonight because they
love radio,” he said.
Andy Parfitt, controller of
Radio 1, expanded on this
theme: “Student radio is an
important source of talent.
Many of Radio 1’s DJs started
on student radio, the quality
here has been incredibly high
and I expect to see future
presenters emerge from this
pool,” he exclaimed from the
podium.
IC Radio won the gold
award two years ago for
speech radio, and this area
seems to be our strength.
The more students involved
with IC Radio, the better we’ll
be, so check out www.icradio.
com and find out how to get
involved.
Fingers crossed for a tangi-
ble trophy next year.
