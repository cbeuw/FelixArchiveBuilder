in brief
UK study sees little
harm in GM crops
A major government and
industry-backed UK study
found no evidence that genet-
ically modified crops harmed
the environment. The project
found that the technology
could even help growers save
money. The four-year study
enraged green groups who
immediately dismissed the
results as one-sided.
Flu pandemic
inevitable
Every country in the world
must urgently come up with
a plan to deal with an inevita-
ble influenza pandemic likely
to be triggered by the bird
flu virus that hit Asia this
year, according to a top glo-
bal health expert. “I believe
we are closer now to a pan-
demic than at any time in
recent years,” said Shigeru
Omi of the World Health
Organization. “No country
will be spared once it becomes
a pandemic”.
Wind industry
to meet energy
demands
The European wind energy
industry, thriving as cli-
mate change tops the global
agenda, says it could eventu-
ally supply all the continent’s
electricity but must first over-
come public resistance over
the appearance of turbines.
The European Wind Energy
Association predicted that
offshore ‘wind farms’ cover-
ing an area the size of Greece
could meet Europe’s electric-
ity needs.
Device to probe
limits of Physics
UK physicists have complet-
ed the first crucial element
of an experimental device
designed to probe the forc-
es that shape our Universe.
The Atlas experiment will
explore the fundamental
properties of matter and look
for ‘new physics’ beyond the
limits of our current under-
standing.
Asia faces results
of climate change
The weather predictions for
Asia in 2050 read like a script
from a doomsday movie. In
the decades to come, Asia
will lurch from one climate
extreme to another, with
impoverished farmers bat-
tling droughts, floods, disease,
food shortages and rising sea
levels, unless there is a global
effort to rein in greenhouse
gas emissions.

Unfortunately there is some-
thing called antagonistic co-
evolution. This means that
as we females are developing
increasingly sophisticated
means of avoiding the con-
straints of a relationship, our
males are evolving state of
the art devices to prevent our
doing so.
Sadly, it’s in every male’s
interest to constrain promis-
cuity to increase the chances
of his, rather than someone
else’s, sperm fertilising an
egg.
As a female, there are sev-
eral manipulation techniques
to be aware of, which may
be broadly grouped into the
behavioural and the physical.
The former are the more sub-
tle and can at times be very
difficult to identify for what
they are.
A good example is the gift.
A virgin green-veined white
butterfly will present his first
female with a food gift that
may be as much as 23% of his
whole body weight. The lucky
(or not so lucky) recipient is
much less likely to re-mate
than one who has received a
smaller gift.
There are two messages
here: be wary of gifts and
avoid virgins.
Another example is atten-
tiveness. In some insects,
continuous antennae tickling
is used to keep the female
permanently locked into a
particular relationship. In the
world of birds, a male tit will
be prepared to have sex at
any time, in any place, to pre-
vent promiscuity.
Again, there is an impor-
tant message here: don’t be
fooled by what appears to
meet demand; there is always
something bigger and better
out there.
While these are all rela-
tively subtle manipulations,
it is crucial to realise that
some males may resort to
brusquer, physical methods
of control if their sperm is
threatened.
Perhaps the most common
ploy in this category is the
plug. This can be a serious
impediment: a scalpel will
bounce off the plug inserted
into the female cavity by a
house mouse after sex. The
male honeybee, should he
beat 25,000 compatriots to the
Queen, will actually explode
after sex, leaving his genitalia
firmly embedded in the royal
flesh.
Even this apparently insur-
mountable obstacle can be
overcome however, and, iron-
ically, the solution is supplied
by the very males who are
trying so desperately to pro-
tect their sperm.
Evolution has helpfully
led to the development of a
wonderful variety of penises
which can be extremely adept
at erasing any traces of a
predecessor in the female
cavity.
An excellent example is
the black-winged damselfly
penis, which is almost exactly
like a toilet brush in form and
function, efficiently cleaning
out the female cavity prior to
penetration. Or take the rat’s
prehensile penis, which oper-
ates through suction.
The message here is obvi-
ous: don’t underestimate the
ingenuity of a potential lover;
use it to your advantage.
There are other physical
means by which males try
to give their sperm an edge
in any particular female, but
since many of these do not
directly impede promiscuity
they are of little interest to
us here. One example is the
attempt to dominate through
volume: dung fly experiments
have revealed that a decrease
in monogamy can be coupled
with an increase in sperm
production.
While this is all very excit-
ing news for the male, we can
afford to ignore it as long as
it does not affect a female’s
desire to copulate.
In conclusion, antagonis-
tic co-evolution is not as bad
as it seems: the increasingly
devious methods of manipu-
lation by males will always
meet their match in females
through co-evolution.
The potential benefits of
female promiscuity will con-
tinue to be a driving force for
its existence and indeed it is
difficult to envisage a scenar-
io in which promiscuity would
be significantly curbed.
For those males who place
their hope in the restraining
power of society, take heed
that the rampant yet stable
societies of chimpanzees and
bonobos that negate the idea
that a functioning society
somehow requires monoga-
my.
Perhaps at the end of the
day, it is time for males to
accept the fact that has been
staring them in the face for so
long now: it is us females who
are really calling the shots
and, yes, we like to have a bit
of fun.
The evolution of female promiscuity

A young Moldavian engineer
is lured to Istanbul on the
promise of work. On his arriv-
al he finds the promise unful-
filled, the job dissolves and it
is suggested to him to sell his
blood in order to pay for his
return fare home. Accepting,
he finds himself awakening
from the anaesthetic with a
deep scar on his left side only
to find that one of his kidneys
is missing. He is offered $3000
for his loss (the going rate for
a kidney in Moldavia) and told
to either accept or to sort his
problem out otherwise. This
is a chilling and gruesome
urban myth-like story report-
ed by the BBC correspondent
Sue Lloyd-Roberts in Turkey.
There are many such
grisly stories circulating on
the streets worldwide, on
the internet, in the shanty-
towns, tent cities and squatter
camps of the third world. The
stories of kidnapping, mutila-
tion and organ selling are a
mixture of metaphor and fact,
and are told and remembered
because people feel that there
is “something going on”.
The sale of human organs
is currently illegal in most
countries, including the UK,
and is considered by many
to be repugnant and morally
outrageous. Critics claim that
making the practice illegal
merely moves it underground.
In many countries such as
India, Israel, China, Turkey,
Iraq and Russia, organ traf-
fic takes place regularly and
without too much attempt at
secrecy.
Investigations by the BBC
into the trade of human
organs in India in 2002 showed
that an Indian city in Madras
had been nicknamed ‘kidney
city’ as most of its inhabitants
had sold this organ for cash.
In these cases, unsurpris-
ingly, socially and financially
disadvantaged individuals are
the ones being exploited; the
buyers are stereotypically for-
eign and wealthy and most of
the money goes to the middle
men.
Nonetheless, perhaps it is
time to accept the fact that all
in this world is now seen as
a commodity, including body
parts, and that the decision to
sell one’s kidney, eye, portion
of the liver or other is an unde-
niable personal privilege.
Donating organs to friends
or family members, perhaps
even strangers in need, would
be thought by many as some-
thing incredibly altruistic and
noble, yet accepting money
for the same renders the exer-
cise intolerable. People who
understand this and see it as
a problem perhaps fail to see
the bigger picture. Most of the
organs that come from living
donors come from the poor
to the rich, from the less pow-
erful to the more powerful,
from the south to the north,
from the black and brown to
the white and from women to
men. The poor undergo what
are generally illegal, unhy-
gienic, ‘dodgy’ operations
to remove and sell precious
organs in order to get out of
debt or to support their fami-
lies, yet the money they get
for this trade is minimal and
their families soon encounter
the same dreadful financial
difficulties.
Furthermore, in a hypo-
thetical world where sell-
ing and not donation is the
keyword, the poor and the
disadvantaged will never be
in a position to afford these
prized organs and will always
remain on the donor side of
the exchange.
On the other hand, as Lloyd
Cohen (a law professor at
George Mason University
in Virginia) suggests, one
could argue that most of the
vital things in our lives (like
food, housing, clothes, etc)
are bought and not donated.
Why can’t the same apply to
organs? We live in a dog-eat-
dog world where power and
money carries a lot of weight,
like it or not.
According to the American
author and newspaper man
Henry Louise Mencken, “for
every complex problem there
is a solution that is simple,
neat and wrong”. Maybe we
have got it wrong and we need
to remove the ban on organ
selling (thus hopefully avoid-
ing a black market system)
and attempt to make these
transplants less exploitative
of poor donors, less expensive
for the rich recipients, and
safer for all.
A survey conducted at
Imperial College on whether
people should be allowed to
sell their organs showed that
40% of students thought this
should be the case whilst the
remainder did not. The public
seems to be undecided, but
what’s is clear to me is that
the issues of legal and illegal
organ trading are linked and
the former needs to be read-
dressed in order for the latter
to change.
Organs for sale: the wages of the poor
“Perhaps it is time to
accept the fact that
all in this world is now
seen as commodity,
including body parts...”
