What’s your biggest
secret? What’s the big-
gest lie you’ve ever told?
What would you be will-
ing to risk to stop it com-
ing out?
In this term’s Dramsoc
play, that’s exactly what
Nora has to ask herself.
How far will she go to
stop her husband from
finding out her secret?
How can she hold her
family together with a
loan shark breathing
down her neck?
Set in the 1880s, Henrik
Ibsen’s A Doll’s House
opens with the Helmer
family joyfully preparing
for Christmas. But the
arrival of an old friend
sets in motion a chain of
events that threatens to
change their lives forev-
er.Childlike, flighty Nora
has to search out a solu-
tion that keeps everyone
happy but as the situation
escalates and an answer
seems harder and harder
to find, she can see only
one way out...
A Doll’s House is one
of the cornerstones of
modern drama. Paving
the way for many of the
scriptwriters you know
today, it earned it’s author
the title “the father of
modern drama”. It was so
contraversial when it was
first published that Ibsen
was forced to rewrite the
ending, which, despite
his vehement protests,
was deemed too unset-
tling for contemporary
audiences. Even now,
over a century later, the
play (with the original
ending intact) still has
the power to shock and
delight. Deliciously acted
by an extraordinary cast,
A Doll’s House is simply
unmissable.
A Doll’s House is show-
ing in the Union Dining
Hall from Wednesday 1
to Saturday 4 December.
Tickets are available on
the door at £4 for stu-
dents and £6 others. You
can book tickets online
at www.dramsoc.org/

what happens for your-
self.
