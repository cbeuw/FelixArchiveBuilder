While the home political front
has looked slightly start-of-
new-session petty this week
(does anyone really care
about David Blunkett’s lov-
er’s nanny, really?) there
have at least been some dra-
matic goings on around the
world, not least a revolution.
So let’s ignore Westminster
for a change and look out over
the water.
The most dramatic, inter-
esting and unexpected story
of the week was that revolu
took place in Ukraine after
the Presidential election was
thought, by half the popula-
tion, to have been rigged in
favour of the incumbent, a
Mr Viktor Yanukovych, who
is the pro-Kremlin candidate
backed by President Putin
and most of the east side of
the country. The challenger,
Viktor Yushenko, is a liberal
who has strong support in
the west (of the world and the
country).
The elections, in which the
official results were 49.6% to
46.6%, were criticised by the
international observers, and
the results were denounced
by leaders around the world.
The result sparked off a mass
riot and close to a civil war
in which hundreds of thou-
sands of protestors filled
the frozen streets to barri-
cade Parliament and the
President’s residence until
the decision was debated by
the High Court. The stakes
were raised when Colin
Powell, still acting as US
Secretary of State despite
his resignation, announced
that Washington “could not
accept” the results and was
prepared to withhold $150
million in annual aid until it
was sorted out. This was not
popular with President Putin,
who sees Ukraine as very def-
initely part of his area of influ-
ence and not America’s.
This was a favourite story
of The Independent all week,
unsurprisingly as it focuses
so strongly on international
news. There were some amaz-
ing pictures in the paper of
protestors placing flowers in
the shields of the riot police,
in a demonstration where
they wished to act peacefully.
The Telegraph also devot-
ed a fair bit of space to the
story, saying that “the crowds
behind Mr Yushchenko are to
be congratulated for challeng-
ing a corrupt system within
Ukraine and Mr Putin’s bla-
tant attempt to influence the
result from without... their
‘orange people power’ has
rocked a corrupt, devious
and retrograde establish-
ment without the fatal con-
sequences visited on rebels
against Soviet rule during the
Cold War or on democracy
demonstrators in Tiananmen
Square 15 years ago. Thanks
to them, Ukraine now has a
chance of fulfilling the dem-
ocratic promise offered by
independence in 1991”.
The Guardian points
out that the interference
in the election by both the
Americans and the Russians
smacks of the Cold War, and
saysthatwhichevercandidate
they choose, the Ukrainians
must be the ones with the
final say. They also point out
that Mr Yushchenko was part
of the same government as
the Prime Minister and so
the situation is not as clear
cut as one would like: “No
one comes away from this
game with completely clean
hands”. Although the situa-
tion in Ukraine is far from
decided, it is thought that
there will be rerun elections,
provided both men say that
they will trust the results a
second time.
Also abroad, but concern-
ing Britain, was the decision
by the England Cricket Board
(ECB) and players to (grudg-
ingly) continue with their tour
of Zimbabwe, provided that
they are never put in a situ-
ation where they may have
to shake hands with govern-
ment officials or President
Robert Mugabe.
The newspapers were gen-
erally scathing about this,
especially after the attempt by
the Zimbabwean authorities
to prevent the entry of sports
journalists into the country.
The Independent compared
the entry of the cricketers to
the simultaneous deportation
of aid workers from the coun-
try, while The Mail called the
matches the “tour of shame”
and said that the only rea-
son they are going is to avoid
financial damage to the ECB.
The Telegraph and The
Guardian reported how the
players themselves did not
want to go but were let down
once again by poor leader-
ship, having been put between
a rock and a hard place. All of
the papers are, it seems, unit-
ed with the players in hoping
the tour is over as quickly as
is humanly possible.
International interest
A look at the week’s developments in Ukraine and Zimbabwe
By John Collins
Last Wednesday, an estimat-
ed 1500 students attended
this year’s highly successful
City & Guilds College Union
Internship Fair, which for
the first time took place in
the College main entrance
near the Tanaka Business
School and in the foyer of
the mechanical engineering
building.
The entirely volunteer-
run Internship Fair, now in
its third year, is an excellent
opportunity for non-final-
year undergraduates to meet
recruiters and organisations
offering a range of options
for students to obtain work
in the summer. Engineering
firms, banks, professional
service firms, research stu-
dents, careers advice staff,
alumni representatives and
charities offering placements
in the third world were all on
hand to advise students of
their many opportunities for
summer work.
Senior College staff,
including the new Faculty of
Engineering Principal, Dr
Julia King, dropped in to lend
their support for what has
becomethelargestInternship
Fair so far.
The C&G Internship Centre
Coordinator, second year
chemical engineering student
Anne Baarup, said that she
was delighted with the high
attendence of both employers
and students, and has many
ideas on how to improve what
is fast becoming CGCU’s
most popular annual event.
