I Heart Huckabees is one bizarre
film. I was confused. I was happy.
I was bored. I was excited. I don’t
even know where I stand with this
film. I could give it one star. I could
give it five stars.
It has to be five stars though. Yes,
it’s quirky, but it’s original and won-
derfully refreshing. It’s a philosoph-
ical film and a simple philosophy at
that: “hope versus despair, and light
versus dark”.
I Heart Huckabees has an out-
standing cast, who seemed to click
together through the eccentricity
of their characters. It is a deep and
meaningful comedy that has made
philosophy funny and entertaining.
The philosophical aspect concerns
the idea of existentialism, a thinking
of uniqueness and isolation of the
individual experience in a hostile
or indifferent universe; it regards
human existence as unexplainable.
These are the kind of ideas that
keep you up all night, wondering
what it all means.
The story follows the not par-
ticularly successful environmen-
talist Albert Markovski (Jason
Schwartzman). Through a series
of coincidences, he is brought to
a happy husband and wife duo – a
detective team who help others to
solve their existential issues. Vivian
(Lily Tomlin) and Bernard (Dustin
Hoffman) portray these slightly
abnormal characters excellently.
Their idea is to stalk Albert ridicu-
lously unsubtly to find clues to what
makes him tick, their philosophy
being that life is like a blanket of
fibres of interconnecting existence
where everything is related.
Albert’s job is to protect a plot of
land that the Huckabees depart-
ment store cooperation is plan-
ning to build on. He’s doing a poor
job and corporrate charmer Brad
Strand (Jude Law) steps in to do
something about it. There is a love/
hate relationship between Albert
and Brad, which is fun to watch on
the screen. Albert is also introduced
to Tommy Corn (Mark Wahlberg),
another client of the existential
agency, and they connect imme-
diately. Wahlberg makes an excel-
lent side kick, a 9/11 fire-fighter
with an anti-petroleum obsession.
He makes you laugh in every scene
– without him, this film wouldn’t
have been half as funny.
Albert and Tommy fall into the
handsofCatherine,aFrenchauburn
sex goddess (I couldn’t really see
that myself), who was an ex-pupil
of Bernard and Vivian gone wrong.
She has formed the opposite theory
to Bernard’s: “Life is meaningless
and valueless, a world of random
chaos where values are arbitrary”.
Perhaps her theory will work?
I Heart Huckabees is an unpre-
dictable ride. It is not a film for
the conventional person. All the
characters are the extreme of a
certain stereotype. Brad is the
‘always happy at work but not on
the inside’ corporate. His girlfriend
Dawn Campbell (Naomi Watts), the
pretty spokesmodel of Huckabees,
is the ‘all looks and no brains’ kind
of girl. Plus there’s the eccentric
environmentalist, Albert, who likes
to write poems. This is a film to
make you really think – it is not
a good movie for those seeking
mindlessentertainment. There are
hidden meanings that will bewilder
and will go over the head of some
viewers.
I was baffled to begin with, as the
story is surreal, and has a strange
plot. Some, like those who walked
out of the film when I watched it,
may find it hard to keep up with.
However, there are some extraordi-
nary ideas and some extraordinary
characters, which are all played so
well, that just make me love this
film in the most absurd way. It’s also
one for the girls with the likes of
Jude Law and Mark Wahlberg. You
may as well stay and watch, even if
it’s just for them.
