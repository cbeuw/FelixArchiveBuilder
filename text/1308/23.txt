To be honest, I really didn’t know
what to expect from this film.
Obviously, it was about Christmas,
which to me implied it was a chil-
dren’s film, not something that I
would generally go to watch or look
forward to. However, I kept an open
mind as I took my seat in the cinema
and waited for The Polar Express to
begin. I was pleasantly surprised.
The film is set on Christmas Eve.
It’s the night before Christmas and
a young boy is at that age where he
is beginning to doubt whether Santa
Claus really exists. A loud racket
wakes him from his sleep as his bed-
room begins to shake. Lights shine
through his window as he realises
something big is moving outside.
Charging out the door into the cold
and into the snow he comes face to
face with an old steam train, The
Polar Express. Accepting the invi-
tation by the conductor, he climbs
aboard as they set off for the North
Pole, and for Santa. He finds he is
not the only one aboard as he sets
eyes on other children of similar
ages, all potentially facing their last
year of believing. However, the ride
is not a smooth journey and it’ll take
more than luck to get them out of
trouble. It’ll take some magic!
Tom Hanks sees to the voice of
the conductor as well as many other
characters in the film. For a brief
moment I thought it might be better
to include a few other big names,
but really the parts are too small.
Returning to my senses I decided
it was a good idea to let Hanks ride
solo. Unsurprisingly for an actor of
his talent, he does a great job.
The Polar Express is pleasing to
the eye from start to finish as the
computer animation is spectacular.
Both the characters and their sur-
roundings look as real as I’ve ever
seen in a CGI movie. At times you
forget that it isn’t real... until you see
elves running around, of course.
Whilst its visual appeal is at an
extraordinary level, it was the
amount of action in the film that
surprised me the most. Obviously it
can’t compete with the latest sci-fi or
thriller but in defence of The Polar
Express, it wasn’t meant to be any
of these things. It’s a Christmas film,
the most action-packed Christmas
film I have ever seen. It includes
everything from the driver losing
control of the train to the train itself
being derailed and skidding across
an enormous glacier. Towards the
end of the movie, the excitement
dies down quite drastically, but the
rest of the film more than makes
up for it.
One thing that I didn’t find so
amazing was the songs. Admittedly
they were probably good in their
own right but they just didn’t appeal
to me and I was grateful that the
characters kept their bursting into
song to a minimum.
I never really considered myself
to be a great fan of Christmas films,
however The Polar Express is worth
watching especially since we are
creeping ever closer to the festive
season, and has certainly changed
my views. I found it really put me in
mood to share the holiday spirit.
Although the film has a few little
kinks in its overall appeal, there
is nothing that should spoil it for
anyone. People of all ages will enjoy
this film if they go bearing in mind
what it is they are about to watch.
It’s about the spirit of Christmas,
so be open minded, sit back, relax
and enjoy.

Dawn just comes too early
Should have been Forgotten and left in America
I’m a great lover of movies. It’s
rare that something comes along
and taints my opinion of Hollywood.
This is one of those unthinkable
moments. The Forgotten is truly
one of the worst movies I’ve seen
in a long time. Before you read
any further, this review contains
plot spoilers, otherwise there is no
way to review this movie. But that
shouldn’t matter – you shouldn’t see
this.
Telly Paretta (Julianne Moore)
lost her son, along with eight other
children, fourteen months ago in a
plane crash. She can’t stop griev-
ing. Her psychiatrist (Gary Sinise)
wonders if she is enhancing her
memories of Sam. She tries to limit
her daily visits to photo albums and
home videos. Then, one horrifying
day, she finds that all her photos
and videos of Sam have vanished
and been erased. She blames her
husband Jim (Anthony Edwards),
but then she gets the bad news: she
never had a son. She had a miscar-
riage. All of her memories of Sam
have been fabricated in some kind of
post-traumatic-syndrome scenario.
The shrink and her husband agree:
no Sam. In desperation, she turns
to a neighbor Ash Correll (Dominic
West), whose daughter also died in
the same crash. He tells her he never
had a daughter. Rather miraculously
though, he remembers, though eve-
ryone else still has no clue.
The movie then descends, quite
frankly, into absurdity and repeti-
tiveness. Its one chase after anoth-
er, where they just seem to get
away every time, even thought the
pursuers are government agents.
There are also the repeated reruns
of Telly’s memories of Sam, and his
annoying smile and wink. Even the
most ardent of movie-goers grows
weary and tired.
The movie is disjointed, with peo-
ple seemingly jumping from one con-
clusion to another. There’s little or
no elaboration upon how they make
some of the absurd conclusions that
they inevitably do in order to drive
a preposterous plot. “The goddamn
truth won’t fit in your brain,” yells
a desperate agent. Sadly, the “god-
damn truth” and plot would fit on
the back of a postage stamp. The
dialogue is lazy; the script is bland
and unintelligent, though adequate-
ly delivered.
There are continuity errors aplen-
ty: running pedestrians over with-
out so much as denting your car
perhaps? The acting is laughable at
times, in particular West’s perform-
ance in an interrogation scene. The
majority of the last hour is laugh-
able.
So why should you go see this
movie? Like Gigli (Ben Affleck and
Jennifer Lopez), the temptation to
go see a shockingly bad movie can
be quite hard to resist, and it can
turn out to be quite a good laugh! Be
warned, however: make sure every-
one knows what they’re getting into,
otherwise you’ll just feel guilty (like
I did) for wasting two hours of your
friends’ lives. Other high points of
The Forgotten include the trailers,
the popcorn and a few shocks and
scares – including a scene where a
cop gets pulled off the case, so to
say; even though highly predictable
it still makes little girls scream.
In all fairness though, Julianne
Moore does give a good perform-
ance, and is convincing. And it has
been a while since I saw a movie
about the paranormal. But ultimate-
ly, I was left wondering why a credit-
able actress like Julianne Moore
agreed to be cast in a terrible movie
like this. Perhaps the money, or even
stranger still maybe she’s a believer.
Who knows? But more incredibly,
why on earth did Revolution Studios
bother to make this, and why did
Columbia choose to distribute it? Do
they really think that there is money
to make with such bad material?
That said, Columbia did manage
to create an enticing trailer that
convinced some poor souls to pay
to watch it.
Seriously though, if you have
free time this week, go see I Heart
Huckabees or The Polar Express. I
wish I had.
