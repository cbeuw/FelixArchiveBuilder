A wealthy city financier died
and his wife was seriously
injured by two knife-wielding
attackers on Monday evening.
The attack took place in
Upper Cheyne Row, Chelsea,
a few minutes’ walk from
Imperial College halls of resi-
dence in Evelyn Gardens.
The couple were attacked
by two youths at their luxury
three-storey town house. The
couple’s nine-year-old daugh-
ter discovered her bleeding
parents and telephoned the
police.
John Monckton, 49, was
head of bonds management
at Legal & General where,
according to The Times, he
controlled approximately
£26bn of assets. He died later
the same night at Chelsea
and Westminster Hospital.
His wife, Homeyra, under-
went intensive surgery and is
now in a critical condition.
StudentsinEvelynGardens,
near London’s fashionable
King’s Road, are used to their
upper class neighbours, but a
violent stabbing must come
as something of a shock.
A Fisher Hall subwarden
told Felix: “In truth, I don’t
think Chelsea is dangerous
– I believe the crime rate
is generally low, especially
compared to nearly every
other London region.” The
subwarden added that stu-
dents should feel safe and
secure, especially as “Evelyn
Gardens are now patrolled at
night by security.”
Dominic Clout, the
Commander of Kensington
and Chelsea Borough Police,
said: “I’ve got a community in
shock. This is a tragic, tragic
murder.”
Two youths were seen flee-
ing the area in the direction of
King’s Road at 7.30pm. Police
believe the murder may have
been a bungled burglary and
are appealing for any wit-
nesses.

Two students arrived at
Tuesday’s meeting of
Imperial College Union
Council expecting to take up
Ordinary Member positions,
only to be told that they had
not been elected after all, due
to a counting error.
Sebastian Pearce and Tom
Tibbits “had been elect-
ed Ordinary Members of
Council”, according to the
minutes of the previous meet-
ing, and claimed that they had
never been officially informed
of the mistake.
The Council, the main gov-
erning body of the students’
union at Imperial College,
spent almost an hour discuss-
ing the issue, without knowing
which of the students present
were elected members and
which were not. One student
asked: “How can this meeting
continue if we don’t know the
membership?”
Mr Pearce said that if he
had been informed of the
error he may have stood in
the recent re-run election,
throwing the results of that
ballot into doubt.
Mustafa Arif, President of
Imperial College Union, asked
for 24 hours to investigate the
issue and told Felix: “I want
to check all the correspond-
ence and the transcript of the
last Council meeting. No elec-
tion process is perfect – the
results are what they are.”
Council confusion over membership
Half of
Imperial
students
to come
from
overseas

The proportion of overseas
students at Imperial College
“could well go to 50-50 over
time”,accordingtotheRector,
Sir Richard Sykes.
A report in The Telegraph
this week stated that Imperial
plans to increase the number
of overseas students and
postgraduates in an attempt
to raise funds.
Universities currently
receive around £5000 per year
from the Government for each
British and European Union
undergraduate, plus just over
£1000 in tuition fees. Students
based elsewhere, howev-
er, are charged upwards of
£10,000 to study at Imperial,
so increasing the proportion
of these students would be
of obvious financial benefit to
the College. Since 2000, the
number of foreign students at
Imperial has risen by almost
one third.
Sir Richard added:
“Overseas students pay the
full economic cost of their
education, unlike British and
European Union students.
The proportion of foreign
students will continue to
grow.”
He also claimed that over-
seas students were often
more capable than their
British counterparts, saying:
“If you take a candidate from
the UK with an A in maths
and one from Singapore with
an A in maths, the student
from Singapore will probably
be better educated.”
