Imperial Women’s 1st 6
Reading Women’s 1st 1
By Hannah Marshall
This week, Imperial ladies
hockey fans will be delighted
to hear that the team cel-
ebrated a long awaited first
emphatic victory of the sea-
son, as for 70 minutes of
freezing Harlington hockey,
the team let Reading feel the
wrath of their new found goal
pie attitude!
Obviously this week we had
neglected our Wednesday
morning reading of journals,
which has previously been
instrumental in leaving us
sleepy for the first 20 min-
utes. In fact, this week, it was
Reading who were vulnerable
from the start, as Imperial
went one-nil up within the
first 20 minutes with a pace-
setting shot from Yoda, which
became her first goal in three
years.
A hardworking Imperial
side then continued to press,
hitting Reading at pace and
leaving them 3-0 down at half
time with more goals from
Embryo and a cracking short
corner from Flush. A quick
but effective team talk – goal
pie – and the onslaught con-
tinued...
The goal posts certainly
weren’t eluding us this week,
as some neat passing play
in midfield and defence paid
dividends for the Imperial
attack. Our right midfielder,
Tandem, had a particularly
solid match, earning her the
‘player of the match’ accol-
lade.
Again, dominating the play
for the second half, Imperial
saw more and more of their
chances converted. Embryo
used her youthful pace to glide
past nearly every Reading
player in one go, taking the
ball from defence to attack
in a sweet run, which was
slotted away with exquisite
style. An indignant Reading
managed a scrappy consola-
tion goal on the break, as our
defence were thinking about
which of them was going to
score next instead of paying
attention to Reading’s threat.
Imperial bounced straight
back and almost immedi-
ately made it 5-1 and then
6-1 with classy scores from
Anticlimax and this season’s
top scorer so far, our very own
DJ (F)lush.
So the warm-up certainly is
over. An elated Imperial team
left the pitch contemplating
futurevictories,whiledejected
Reading skulked home. A fan-
tastic team performance, with
a touch of class from every
player throughout. Bring on
St Mary’s next week!

Chilterns Men’s 3rd 1
Imperial Men’s 3rd 1
Having lost narrowly to a fluky
long range hoof against Bucks
in the home BUSA fixture,
the mighty Thirds travelled to
sunny Buckinghamshire for
the return match.
With only a few changes
after the Holloway game,
bringing in country yokel
Tim in at left back and Jan
returning on the right, the
Thirds left in plenty of time
to get to High Wycombe in
the big blue fun bus, narrowly
avoiding ploughing into the
back of a car on the motorway
because “Shatters’ foot got
stuck under the brake”.
We arrived in the armpit
of Britain to find that the
pitch was as lumpy as a sack
of potatoes and the referee
seemed to have forgotten his
pacemaker. Still, we kicked
off believing we could get a
decent result, with a lot of
the play in the centre of the
pitch.
Attempts on goal seemed
to be few and far between
for the Thirds, restricted to
long range efforts from Tim
and John Slavin. At the other
end, the back four were prov-
ing resilient in denying the
country bumpkins any decent
chances from the numer-
ous corners they won. After
some concerted pressure in
midfield, however, the Thirds
managed to carve a chance
for John Scott following a
through ball by Slavin. Scott
finished with his usual skeffy
aplomb and pea-rolled the
ball into the corner of the net
past the ‘keeper. Get in!
Bucks came back at us
pretty hard, with some strong
challenges flying in from all
directions. Leon was “kindly
helped up” after one chal-
lenge by a Bucks player who
thought that dragging him
along the ground for a couple
of metres by his shirt was
doing him a favour. Eventually
the pressure started to tell,
and a mix-up between James
Haugh and Caruso resulted
in one of their strikers hook-
ing the ball goalbound. Only a
last second clearance off the
line by Tim stopped Bucks
getting their equaliser.
Unfortunately for us, they
succeeded a few minutes
later. Another corner, this
time cleared perfectly by the
defence, resulted in the refe-
ree having a moment of mad-
ness and blowing a whistle
for a foul on a striker. When
asked who committed the
offence, he pointed off in an
indiscriminate direction at
nobody in particular, no doubt
absent-mindedly dreaming of
the days when he was young
and would play football in
the park with the other boys,
jumpers for goalposts and
oranges at half time. Their
striker buried the spot-kick to
make it one-all. It stayed the
same way until the half time
whistle.
After half time, Bucks again
came out strong. Having a
combined IQ that could have
passed as a Tiger Woods
golf score, they thought that
good football meant hoofing
it to their striker and then
kicking whoever got in their
way. Plenty of rash tackles
resulted in some fiery banter
all around, with their central
midfielder, now confirmed to
be the Missing Link in human
evolution, particularly vicious.
Still, resolute defending, good
luck and the commitment
never to give up meant that
we kept out any chances they
had.
Unfortunately we were una-
ble to create any clear cut
chances and steal a victory
at the end, in no large part
due to their linesman’s insist-
ence on flagging anything
that might look like a poten-
tial chance offside. After the
game, it was off to the Tesco
café for a quick slap up meal
and then back on the funbus
for a suicidal drive back into
London and some free pints
at the Union.

Mystery penalty costs Thirds points
Imperial Men’s 3rd 3
Luton Men’s 4th 1
By Ian Robinson
Team Big Kick were in buoy-
ant mood at Harlington ahead
of their BUSA clash with
Luton Fourths, boosted by
the return of their favourite
idiot to form the dolphin-like
ring of steel at the back.
With the loss of Has in cen-
tre midfield and the fact that
Luton had lost every single
game this season, captain
Shatters felt it was time to
shuffle the pack and bring in
Clement for his first taste of
third team sexy football.
The game began with
Imperial on the back foot
after a series of attacks from
Luton. After a while, Imperial
began to press forward with
some real purpose, providing
Perry with a couple of half
chances which Luton were
lucky to keep out. Despite
constant moaning at the ref
from a few Luton players,
the inevitable soon occurred
when Imperial took the lead.
This came via a penalty from
the trusty boot of Hideki after
a foul on new boy Clement in
the box.
The tight Imperial defence
held out until half time to
receive a few words of encour-
agement from Shatters. The
second half began much like
the first had finished, with
Luton trying their best to
hold out against the attack-
ing might of Imperial Thirds.
After Hideki had put their
right back on his arse for
about the 33rd time with some
mazy dribbling, he responded
by hacking down the tricky
winger on the edge of the box.
Hideki stepped up himself to
float in a sublime ball to the
six yard line where it was met
by the salmon-like dolphin
head of centre back Caruso,
who had stolen in at the back
post to nod home his second
goal of the season.
By now, Imperial were hav-
ing such dominance of the
game that Adam felt it was
only right to give Luton a
chance to get back into it.
Receiving the ball in the cen-
tre of the park, he turned to
play their midfielder in and
leave the dolphins at the back
in a three on two situation.
Some unusually poor tackling
then led to two men charg-
ing on Shatters, and unfor-
tunately he hacked down the
one without the ball leaving
their striker to slot the ball
past Imperial ‘keeper James.
This brought Luton back into
the game with the score at
2-1.
Unfortunately for Luton,
however, they still hadn’t fig-
ured out how to make tackles
at the back and proceeded to
give away another free-kick
away in a dangerous area.
This led to Caruso charging
into the penalty area and
yet again turning into a pink
salmon. Despite cries from
the Luton captain of “We
know where this is going”,
they clearly didn’t because
yet again the salmon rose
at the back post to glance
home another fine free kick
from the boot of Hideki. The
mighty Imperial had regained
their two-goal lead, but all
the scorer had to show for it
this time was a big kiss from
captain Shatters.
As Luton’s frustration grew
the game descended into a
dirty affair with Anthony very
lucky to stay on the pitch for
a two-footed lunge. The game
was all but over when sub
John Slavin had a goal disput-
ably ruled out for offside.
All round, it had been a fine
performance from the mighty
Thirds as they kept the pres-
sure on at the top of their
BUSA group.
