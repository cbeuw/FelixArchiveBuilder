This is the news: blind car
thief arrested in Romania
after crashing car into tree,
undertaker blown into grave
by gust of wind during funer-
al, half naked New Yorker
walks into police station and
confesses murder, and final-
ly, lightening bolt kills 10,000
kosher chickens.
This week’s science section
features our first ever maths
feature article. Alex Antonov
looks at the importance of
the Millennium problems in
mathematics and in particu-
lar the P = NP problem which
has eluded explanation for so
long.
We also report on the
Government’s White Paper
on public health. Tom
Simonite looks at the ban on
smoking and the epidemio-
logical evidence for the dan-
gers of passive smoking, and
Rosie Taylor examines the
dietary issues and what the
Government is planning to do
to make us healthier.
The ban on smoking is
something that should be at
the forefront of every smoker
and non-smoker’s attention.
What was once a fashionable
habit in the 1950s may quickly
become a social faux-pas. The
Government’s legislation is
essentially recognising pas-
sive smoking as a ‘risk’. This
will inevitably lead to further
stigmatisation of smokers.
Whether this is justified or not
on the basis of the evidence is
a question that, to my mind,
remains answered.
We also look at organ-traf-
ficking and the exploita-
tive economy that has risen
because of it. Giovanna Larice
takes a realistic approach to
what many see as a deeply
immoral trade. Given the
capitalist values that gov-
ern the world economy at
the moment, why shouldn’t
poor people be allowed to sell
their organs in a free mar-
ket? Surely legitimising organ
sales would put a stop to an
illegitimate black market
trade that sees donors being
exploited by the middle men
and rich purchasers? These
are some of the questions
addressed in the article.
Last year I interviewed
Olivia Judson, whose book Dr.
Tatiana’s Sex Advice To All
Creation was reviewed. This
week, Sonja van Renssen
takes an interesting look at
the major theme of this book
which is the evolutionary biol-
ogy of sex – perhaps a taboo
subject for the more conserv-
atively inclined, but certainly
a legitimate field for scientific
study.
Finally we have a review
of the Annual Pfizer Lecture
which asks the question: what
is it to be human? Andya
Primanda’s review takes
a look at what separates us
from the ape world and our
own genetic diversity.
So what is it to be human?
The Pfizer Annual lecture at the Natural History Museum raised the questions. Andya Primanda
reports on our genetic links with the ape world and our own genetic diversity
What makes us human?
Dr Armand Marie Leroi
opened the first part of this
year’s Pfizer Annual Science
Lecture 95% Chimp – The
Genes that make us Human
by reflecting on a 1860s
debate over that question
between two scientific giants
of their time: Thomas Henry
Huxley and Richard Owen.
Earlier scholars like Galen
and Linnaeus had acknowl-
edged that apes closely
resemble humans, and
Darwin’s theory implied a
common descent between
humans and apes.
In the nineteenth century,
Richard Owen, who wanted to
protect man’s special status
in nature, sought to find the
key difference that separates
humans from animals, and he
claimed that the hippocam-
pus minor, a small fold at the
back of the brain, is only pos-
sessed by humans. Huxley
argued that any difference
between humans and animals
were just a matter of degree,
and there was nothing special
separating humans from ani-
mals. However, Huxley later
conclusively demonstrated
that the hippocampus minor
is also present in ape brains.
This demonstration marks
Huxley’s victory over Owen.
More than 100 years later,
after subsequent develop-
ments which included the
birth of genetics, the synthe-
sis of evolution and genetics
and the discovery of DNA, the
question of what makes us
human re-emerged. The first
DNA hybridization studies
found a 99% match between
human and chimpanzee DNA,
and later research tended to
reinforce this conclusion by
achieving roughly the same
results (95% to 99% simi-
larity). By 2003, the human
genome had been completely
mapped, and the first draft of
the chimpanzee genome had
been finished. This data is to
provide new ways to answer
our question, to find out what
are the differences that made
us human. How do we find
which differences are impor-
tant? Dr Leroi suggested, by
studying mutants.
Leroi cited the case of
the ‘Chuas’. The Chuas are
a group of beggars in Shah
Daulah, Pakistan. They have
small heads and are mentally
retarded, a condition known
as ‘microcephaly’. Carl Vogt,
an earlier student of human
variations, studied micro-
cephaly because he thought
it would give him clues to
the evolution of humans. It is
now known that microcepha-
ly is caused by a genetic dis-
order, a deleterious recessive
mutation at the gene ASPM.
ASPM is now known to be
involved in brain growth, and
further studies show that it
underwent some major evo-
lutionary changes during the
course of human evolution.
ASPM is only the first
known genetic difference
between humans and apes.
Another gene, FOXP2, was
discovered to be associated
with language ability. Dr
Leroi predicts that we will
find more of those differenc-
es as we do more compari-
sons across the human and
chimp genome. These genes
are part of what makes us
human.
In the second part of the
talk, Dr Leroi addressed the
genetic diversity among liv-
ing humans. Back at the time
of Owen, Huxley and Darwin,
racism was a general belief.
People thought that there are
inferior and superior races.
But now, thankfully, such
belief has been largely aban-
doned. This change in our
views might be prompted by
the Holocaust and the World
Wars, in which racist ideolo-
gies caused horrible disas-
ters to humanity.
After the advent of genet-
ics, scientists started to study
genetic variation among
humans. First it was discov-
ered that, at the genetic level,
races don’t exist. However,
this conclusion is somehow
hard to grasp, because it
runs counter to people’s daily
experiences.
There is a paradox in mod-
ern genetics. We now know
so much about DNA and the
genes but the simple ques-
tions remain unanswered.
Ask a geneticist, “Why do
people have brown or blue
eyes?” The answer might be,
“It’s in the genes.” But if you
push for the details, asking
what genes are responsible
and how they do it, it’s possi-
ble that our geneticist would
not know the answer.
However, there have been
studies on the genes respon-
sible for visible differences. At
least one gene, MC1R, which
influences skin/hair pigmen-
tation, has a variation that
corresponds to geographical
populations, or, races. This
shows that, at least from
MC1R’s point of view, human
races do exist. Supporting
evidence also comes from
the discovery that different
human ethnicities have dif-
ferent genetic disorder fre-
quencies and genetic predis-
position towards certain dis-
eases, for instance, sickle cell
anemia among Africans and
cystic fibrosis among north-
ern Europeans.
The study of racial variation
isacontroversialtopic.Critics
have already warned that the
study of ‘racial science’ might
end up misused by racists.
However, certain differences
between races are real, and
we need to understand them
if we are to implement social
justice. Why do we need to
know what makes people dif-
ferent? Apart form the obvi-
ous practical purposes, Dr
Leroi pointed out another
reason. There are people at
the Natural History Museum
and Imperial College stud-
ying the diversity of birds,
flowers, parasitic wasps, and
many others. If the diversity
of these creatures are con-
sidered significant enough to
justify research, then surely
human diversity deserves
more attention. And, he con-
cluded the lecture, diversity
itself is beautiful and admira-
ble, something that is worth
preserving and studying.
Some questions from the
audience were concerned
about the use of the results
of human diversity studies.
One raised the possibility
of discrimination based on
genetic profiles. Another
asked whether the informa-
tion would lead to ‘designer
babies’, parents choosing
certain features for their
unborn children. A geneticist
commented that the human
genetic diversity data is valu-
able for the purpose of tailor-
ing drugs to meet the needs of
various genetic backgrounds.
This practice is not racist,
she said, but the opposite is.
Using drugs tested on a cer-
tain ethnic group on another
with a different genetic pro-
file would be dangerous and
irresponsible.
The audience’s concern
seemed to converge on one
theme – issues of ethics. The
public asked the scientist,
“What should we do with all
this data of human genet-
ics?” Genetics has become
the 21st century Pandora’s
Box, just as nuclear physics
was the 20th century’s. We
have discovered a lot, but we
are still hesitant about this
new knowledge. Would it be
a great benefit or disaster to
humanity?
Dr Leroi replied that sci-
entists are not always capa-
ble to resolve ethical issues.
This dialogue would require a
greater public understanding
of science and the involve-
ment of those competent in
answering ethical questions
– philosophers, theologians,
lawmakers. And while the
scientist’s job is primarily to
find what is, I believe it is
also the scientists’ respon-
sibility to keep the pub-
lic informed of their work.
Ignorance is no help, and the
knowledge must be shared
with everyone.
YOUR SCIENCE VIEWS

Last week’s article on animal testing provides some useful
information but, as usual, sees the issue from a myopic human
perspective. Animal testing and factory farming are just examples
of our arrogance as human beings...
(for the rest of this response, see Comment, page 10)
Veer Singh, Physics
Firstly, it will always be hard to understand what an animal ‘thinks’ or
‘feels’. If it was possible to fully understand what an animal feels and
thinks then this discussion would probably end pretty quickly. Second,
developments to reduce animal testing are underway and new
procedures are in place to minimise the use of animals. But to test the
products on humans will obviously lead to many further questions, such
as who and how? Consider this: testing on humans usually requires
higher costs (through payments and procedures). Already drugs are very
expensive, and this could increase this even further.
