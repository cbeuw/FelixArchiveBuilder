‘Childe Roland to the dark tower
came’ – Robert Browning (1855)
These were the words of a nar-
rative poem that inspired Stephen
King to begin his longest and argu-
ably best work.
The Dark Tower series consists
of seven parts. The first was written
in 1982 and then for several years
the series lay abandoned, before
being continued at a slow rate until
the late nineties. Readers who had
travelled with the characters were
left waiting at several points. In the
last few years, Stephen King has
completed the series, with the last
two volumes being published this
year.
The final instalment, The Dark
Tower, was released this autumn.
Unfortunately for us poor stu-
dents, this means that the last few
books are only available in hard-
back at the moment. However, the
hardback versions are very beauti-
ful things, with colour plates scat-
tered at various points throughout
the books.
The series is an epic fantasy
adventure in a similar style to The
Lord of the Rings, but with different
atmospheres and characters. The
first character we meet is Roland,
the last gunslinger, the lone gun-
man, duster flapping in the wind as
he comes into town from the desert
like Clint Eastwood in High Plains
Drifter, revolvers at his hips. At the
same time, he is a noble and the last
of a royal line, part Arthurian knight,
part diplomat and when necessary,
all cold-eyed killer.
The characters weave in and
out of post-apocalyptic landscapes
(due to ‘the world moving on’), clas-
sic spaghetti western scenes and
twisted versions of legends and
fairytales as they pass through
environments that could be taken
from Stephen Kings other books and
which, as the story progresses, actu-
ally are.
Having read quite a lot of King’s
work, I can easily imagine Roland
and his companions, Eddie the
reformed junkie, Susanna, Jake and
Oy (the talking Billy Bumbler – a
kind of dog) appearing in the back-
ground of his other stories, espe-
cially ones like The Stand, and this
is one of the reasons for the gap in
the series.
Stephen King was in some way
writing of Roland’s world whilst he
wrote all of the rest of his books.
They all fit in somewhere to the
mythology and world that the Dark
Tower series is set in, some with
more relevance than others. I have
sometimes been disappointed with
the endings of King’s books, but as
he says himself in one of the many
epilogues, this is perhaps because
he lost track of the character in
this particular story as the char-
acter has moved on into the Dark
Tower series. Thankfully, after wad-
ing through the thousands of pages
of this series, I was not disappointed
with the finale.
Roland’s quest is for the dark
tower, the hub of existence, at the
centre of all worlds. He believes that
on reaching the tower he will be able
to prevent ‘the decay of worlds’, to
prevent the rest of the worlds mov-
ing on and decaying like his own
did through war, plague and loss of
knowledge. But that is not the main
reason for the quest: just as one of
Roland’s companions is a heroin
addict, Roland is a ‘Tower Junkie’,
driven to get to the tower, leav-
ing a trail of bodies of both friends
and enemies in his relentless and
dogged pursuit of his goal through
time and space.
You may be familiar with the con-
cept of alternate realities, either
through quantum theory or (perhaps
just as likely at Imperial) through
movies such as Jet Li’s The One.
In these different times and places,
the heroes encounter modern day
New York as well as other worlds
eerily similar to our own. The vil-
lains of the piece are a varied cast: a
sinister man in black whom Roland
is pursuing from the outset of the
first book and the master villain, the
Crimson King, as well as vampires,
robots, evil magic users, insane AIs
and post-apocalyptic survivors such
as those found in Mad Max and the
Mafia.
The series starts with the stories
of each of Roland’s companions as
he draws them from their own place
and time in our world. At the same
time Roland’s own history devel-
ops in flashbacks and tales told by
the gunslinger himself. One book,
Wizard and Glass (the fourth in the
series) is almost entirely devoted to
this angle.
The books make gripping reading,
and, if nothing else, the series is a
page-turner. I am glad I waited until
the last books were released before
I began reading: the wait of a week
or so between getting hold of books
is bad enough, so I can’t imagine
what the initial fans went through,
having to wait the better part of two
decades for their next tale.
The books are typical Stephen
King: in some cases needlessly and
crassly sexually explicit, in others a
little too weird, stretching the imagi-
nation of even a willing reader.
One very refreshing thing is that
however attached you are to the
characters, you know that any of
them might fall by the wayside, and
this helps remove the kind of ‘the
hero is invincible’ sense that some
fantasy fiction books have. It makes
the story more ‘realistic’, if such a
word can be applied to this undoubt-
edly odd tale, as well as creating
suspense.
These books were responsible for
several late nights as I was unable
to turn the light out and sleep – I
just had to know what came next.
Perhaps not classic literature, but
they are a very good read.

The Dark Tower

HHHHI
“The most important discovery of
all time” is the claim Simon Singh
makes of the Big Bang (also known
as the HSK) model. Indeed, it is
hard to think of many scientific dis-
coveries more fundamental than
the theory of the beginning of eve-
rything. Does the book, however,
live up to its explosive title?
Big Bang is very cleverly struc-
tured, running backwards and for-
wards through time simultaneously
(although, there is no such thing
as simultaneity, of course). Singh
starts with the ancients’ studies of
the earth, moves on to the under-
standing of the sun-centred solar
system in the renaissance, through
to the discovery of galaxies outside
our own in the 20th century, and
then to quasars. As time passes,
astronomers have been able to see
further and further away and, due
to the finite nature of the speed of
light, further into the past. Hence,
Singh describes mankind’s probing
further and further into the past,
reaching, inevitably, the Big Bang.
The strongest point of the book is
that it leaves in the details that first
year mechanics lectures left out for
some reason. For example, I never
realised that Tycho Brahe had a pet
elk. Also, from the rather solemn
pictures of Tycho himself, no-one
would expect the astronomer to be
such a party animal (the pet elk
in question died after falling down
the stairs due to excessive alcohol
consumption, apparently).
This book does well to place the
science in context – although Pius
XII, Igor Stravinsky and viagra
contributed very little to the HSK
model, the book reminds us that
science doesn’t take place in a vac-
uum.
The style Singh uses is, under-
standably, geared towards non-sci-
entists, and so I believe that any-
body would be able to enjoy this
book. The range of physics he cov-
ers is very broad, including classical
mechanics, relativity, atomic and
nuclear physics, electromagnetism
as well as the obvious astrophys-
ics and cosmology. These are all
explained very effectively, although
some physicists will find a few of the
explanations slightly tedious. There
are some more complicated points
in the epilogue to keep everyone on
their toes, though.
The major criticism I have of Big
Bang is that its greatest strength
also shows its flaws. Despite the
effective telling the story of the HSK,
it does skip over a few characters
– the roles of Lorentz, Poincare and
Schott, for example, are missed out
completely. The phrase “Chadwick
discovered the neutron”, along with
a picture claiming to show the exte-
rior of the laboratory where he did
it, will doubtless have a few peo-
ple up in arms. Also, the sense of
humour is slightly bad at times. I
am one of the worst offenders as
far as appalling physics jokes are
concerned, but still, Singh takes
it to the limit. Describing Franz
Zwicky as the leader of “The Tired-
Light Brigade,” and the recession of
galaxies in terms of the Milky Way’s
“Cosmic body odour”... there is only
so much that I can stand! But then
again, this is a matter of personal
taste.
Of course, there is a strong con-
nection to the college. Singh used
to be president of the Royal College
of Science Union, as well as editor
of the physics student magazine,
Schrödinger’s Cat. Those of you
with sharp eyes may recognise a
few names Singh mentions inci-
dentally, in particular Huxley and
(a more recent example) Rowan-
Robinson.
So, overall, Big Bang is an inter-
esting read, but don’t expect too
much deep physics from it. It is,
after all, a popular science book, and
it does what it sets out to do well.
Oh, and what does HSK stand for?
According to Calvin and Hobbes, it’s
the ‘Horrendous Space Kablooie’.
