Look after your pennies and the
pounds will look after themselves
Your time at university should be
enjoyable. Unfortunately these days
it seems that to study at university
you need to get into debt. This of
course means that students need to
be much more aware of their finan-
cial position and the money they are
spending.
Especially at this time of year
leading up to Christmas, money
can be very tight among the stu-
dent community, not just because
some people like to spend money
on presents for friends and families,
but also because they can get a bit
excited and spend their student loan
very quickly.
Below are some dos and don’ts of
debt, courtesy of the Union Advice
Service.
Do...
Budget
The modern university experience
requires excellent budgeting skills.
Work out exactly what essential
costs you have each month (rent,
food, bills etc) and then divide what
you have left into weekly amounts.
Try taking that amount out at the
start of the week and sticking to it,
rather than making numerous trips
to the cash point.
Choose your bank carefully
People are more likely to divorce
than change banks, according to one
old adage, so think carefully about
who you choose to bank with. Don’t
be sucked in by free promotional
offers when you open the account.
Find out what the deal is for repay-
ing that interest-free student over-
draft; you may end up with a whack-
ing interest rate the minute you
leave your final exam.
Check everything you’re entitled
to. The Advice Service can tell you
about your eligibility to apply for a
hardship loan.
Work sensibly
90% of students are now forced to
work during their course just to
keep their heads above water. Think
about when you are likely to be most
busy with exams and essays and
try to fit in more hours during the
quieter periods.
Don’t...
Think you’re loaded
The first instalment of a student
loan may look like a considerable
amount of money. However, remem-
ber that this has to last you all term
and once the essentials are taken
out it is clearly not a ticket to go on
a spending spree.
Keep quiet about financial
problems
Not everyone finds it easy to talk
candidly about their financial situa-
tion. Do not bottle these problems
up in the hope that they will go away
– they won’t. Speak to the Union
Advice Service, who will be able
to advise you on managing your
money.
Spend money you don’t have
Spending money you know you don’t
have in your bank account is a very
expensive way of solving any short-
term problems. Many banks charge
big fees for any unauthorised trans-
action. In some cases you could be
paying a daily charge if you have
gone over your limit, as well as
administration costs of around £20
per letter should the bank decide to
write and inform you of your misde-
meanour.
Give into peer pressure
University is a fantastic experience
and there is generally something
going on 24 hours a day. However,
when you cannot afford to do some-
thing, you cannot afford to do it.
Don’t accept loans from friends to
fund an evening out – they may not
be quite so friendly when you cannot
pay them back.
Please be aware that if things get
really bad and you have exhausted
all areas of income, the College have
the access to learning fund which
you may be eligible for. Contact
the student finance office in
the Sherfield building for more
information.
Remember, if you have any money
worries at all, contact the Union
Advice Service and we will be happy
to help.

Since 9/11 and especially since then,
there has been a heightened sense
of security awareness in all parts of
the western world, but in particular
in the United States. To some extent
this has manifested itself in addi-
tional vigilance but it has also, argu-
ably, led to a degree of paranoia.
Exploitation of that paranoia has
enabled politicians and administra-
tors to introduce draconian new leg-
islation, procedures and practises
that interfere with and aim to con-
trol the day-to-day lives of ordinary
citizens.
It’s often stated that where
America jumps, the world follows.
The new ‘security conscious’ climate
has certainly been crossing over
the Atlantic and embedding itself
here. First, the Government intro-
duced ‘emergency’ powers in the
Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security
Act 2001. Amongst other affronts
on civil liberties, this enabled the
Home Secretary to detain foreign
terror suspects, indefinitely, without
charge. [Those of you who have
been following the case of former
Imperial student Babar Ahmad will
know that this legal instrument was
used to hold him without charge
- see Colin Smith’s article on the
opposite page.] In order to pass this
legislation, the Government had to
opt out of the European Convention
on Human Rights, which it itself
had introduced into UK law with the
Human Rights Act 1998.
The Government is now following
its anti-terror legislation with a con-
troversial bill to introduce National
Identity Cards, as outlined in the
Queen’s speech last week. Civil lib-
erties campaigners are up in arms
over proposals that would enable
law enforcement agencies – and oth-
ers – to have access to unprecedent-
ed levels of personal information on
each and every one of us.
The trouble when governments
become Orwellian is that the cul-
ture gets embedded in all levels of
society. And it’s on that basis that
developments in Imperial College
security policies trouble me.
When I was a first year undergrad-
uate, back in October 1999, secu-
rity was mainly behind the scenes.
Security guards did not wear cheap-
looking imitation police caps; nor
did they wear bright ‘dayglow’ jack-
ets. You would see security guards
around but they generally wouldn’t
bother you too much. No-one would
ever ask you for ID as you walked
to and from classes – though in my
department (computing) it was com-
mon for security to do an ID card
check in the computer lab every
now and then to stop students from
other departments using our supe-
rior facilities.
Now security is much more overt
and visible, and it’s beginning to
get intrusive. Every student or staff
member who walks into the Tanaka
business school is confronted by a
less than friendly looking security
guard requesting to see your swipe
card. (You’d have thought that if
this was really important someone
would have at least installed a swipe
card reader or barrier.) Aside from
feeling sorry for the poor guard who
has to stand there all day doing the
most boring job imaginable, I won-
der where this is all leading us.
I do appreciate that security need-
ed a shake-up – there had been
too many mumblings about security
guards failing to prevent thefts of
property around College. And I do
recognise that, particularly on the
medical sites, there is a high degree
of sensitive research that needs to
be secure. (I tested my swipe card
on the door of the nuclear reactor
centre at Silwood Park and was both
disappointed and relieved when it
failed to let me in.)
Yet there’s something deeply
unsettling about having to wear ID
cards around your neck at all times
and having to prove your identity
before you attend a lecture. This is
an academic institution, and one of
the basic principles of academia is
the freedom to explore the bounda-
ries of knowledge. Draconian secu-
rity practices do not, in my mind,
engender the sort of culture in
which academics and students feel
‘free’. Their value is also question-
able. Most major thefts happen out
of hours when most buildings are on
swipe access anyway.
Also, the College is now consider-
ing whether to make it compulsory
for students to provide certifica-
tion of vaccination against menin-
gitis and mumps as a condition of
entry. Other universities, such as
Bristol, are considering the same.
The intentions are well-minded (this
year nearly 600 first years received
meningitis vaccinations after term
had started, leaving them vul-
nerable to an outbreak) and it is
intended that there be some flex-
ibility. Nevertheless there are some
serious issues of civil liberties and
medical ethics to consider here. Is it
right that your university (or indeed
anyone) should be able to force you
to take a vaccination in order to
study? (Medics already have to take
a hepatitis B jab for clinical prac-
tice, but that’s because of patient
contact.) Whatever you think about
it, this is probably a breach of the
Universal Declaration of Human
Rights.
Upcoming legislation in the next
few months and years may mean
that the College is either required
(or feels that it is required) to do
security vetting of students before
they can work in certain research
areas. This could be sensible in some
circumstances, such as protecting
vivisectionists from more militant
animal rights activists. A more likely
reason for such legislation is that
it would give the Government lev-
erage over universities to prevent
students from coming here to study
things like nuclear physics because
of their political beliefs or affilia-
tions and nationality. Is it right for
a university to be forced to restrict
admission of students on that basis?
How does this fit with academic
freedom?
All this things trouble me. That’s
not to say that I wouldn’t agree to
any of them in particular. But the
overall impact and culture they cre-
ate is worrying. as is their wider
implications. Our need for security
is real, yet we should not be sacrific-
ing our freedom. There are no quick
answers, but I look forward to the
debate.
