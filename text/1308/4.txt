“Who of us would not be glad
to lift the veil behind which
the future lies hidden; to cast
a glance at the next advanc-
es of our science and at the
secrets of its development
during future centuries?”
Thus David Hilbert opened
his address to the second
International Congress of
Mathematicians in Paris
on 8 August 1900, before
announcing his seminal list
of 23 problems. Much of the
mathematical research in the
20th century has been influ-
enced by this list of unsolved
problems, as both successful
and unsuccessful attempts
at solutions have yielded a
number of important discov-
eries on the way.
To commemorate the occa-
sion and provide a suitable
launch for mathematics into
a new century and a new mil-
lennium, one hundred years
later, the newly-formed Clay
Mathematics Institute (CMI)
of Cambridge, MA, devised
its own list of old nuts that
have yet to be cracked and
formally announced it at the
Collège de France in Paris
on 24 May 2000 in a lecture
entitled “The Importance of
Mathematics”. While to some
the latter might sound like
an obvious oxymoron, there
are some circumstances sur-
rounding this list of problems
which indicate that this is not
just mathematics for math-
ematics’ sake.
For one, the founder and
sponsor of the CMI is not
himself a mathematician, nor
did he read maths at uni-
versity. Landon T Clay is a
Boston businessman who
believes maths research is
underfunded and would like
to see a wider dissemination
of mathematical knowledge.
Then, there is also the attrac-
tive price tag of $1,000,000
attached to each of the seven
problems to be won by the
first person to demonstrate
a correct solution. So if you
thought maths couldn’t make
you rich and famous, think
again!
The list of problems itself
has been carefully selected to
include not only the most dif-
ficult ones, but also the ones
whose solutions would have a
relevance to areas of mathe-
matics and the other scienc-
es beyond the one in which
the problem was originally
for-mulated, hopefully lead-
ing to further serendipitous
discoveries en route. Thus,
far from being formal exer-
cises, the seven prize prob-
lems are widely considered
the most important problems
in mathematics.
In an extended feature, I
propose to look at each of the
seven so-called millennium
problems in a non-special-
ist manner and explain its
significance, while conveying
some of the excitement con-
tained in the mathematical
concepts behind it. The first
problem we consider is the P
vs NP problem, notorious for
the plethora of false proofs it
regularly attracts.
P = NP?
Despite a rather unassuming
name, the P vs. NP prob-
lem is, in a way, the problem
of all problems. Originating
in the field of computational
complexity theory, it is essen-
tially concerned with how
easy it is to solve problems
on a computer, or, put more
cynically, whether computers
will eventually replace math-
ematicians. Indeed, were this
problem to be solved in the
affirmative, it is most likely
that a computer could furnish
the proofs to the remaining
six millennium problems.
So what do the symbols P
and NP actually mean and
why is their (in)equality so
difficult to ascertain?
P and NP are just two of
the many classes in complex-
ity theory used to distinguish
between the difficulty of prob-
lems. Generally speaking,
problems that are in P are
easy to solve, while problems
in NP are difficult to solve, but
significantly, given an answer
to an NP problem, it is easy to
verify whether it is indeed a
solution. For example, many
of the problems involved in
data processing, such as sort-
ing information or searching
and re-trieving, are instances
of P-type problems. Formally,
P stands for polynomial time,
which means that the number
of steps required to obtain a
solution can be expressed as
a polynomial in the length of
the input.
On the other hand, there
are data-processing prob-
lems that are not so easy.
Consider, for instance, the
‘floppy-disk-packing’ problem
which asks whether, given a
number of floppy disks and
a number of computer files,
it is possible to copy all the
files to the floppy disks. For
small numbers of disks and
files, it is straightforward
to give an answer: you just
go through all the possible
combinations. However, if
large numbers are involved,
it quickly becomes very diffi-
cult to solve: the possibilities
are simply too many. At the
same time, given a particu-
lar answer, you can reason-
ably easily check whether it
is indeed a correct answer.
This is an example of an NP-
type problem. Formally, NP
stands for non-deterministic
polynomial time and includes
the problems whose answers
can be checked in polynomial
time, given the right informa-
tion.
However, the ‘floppy-disk
packing’ problem is not just
any NP problem. It is in fact
an NP-complete problem,
which means that all other
NP problems can be reduced
to it. This includes some inter-
esting examples, such as the
problem of prime factorisa-
tion, which is in NP but is not
known to be NP-complete.
Before you get too excited,
let me point out that there
are actually quite a few NP-
complete problems, so there
is nothing special about our
floppy disk example. In fact,
there are a number of popu-
lar games that can be formu-
lated as NP-complete prob-
lems, among them checkers,
crossword puzzle generation,
and even Minesweeper!
Let us recall the actual
problem: is P equal to NP?
In other words, if the solu-
tions to a problem are easy to
verify, is it possible that the
answers can be easy to com-
pute as well? It turns out that
this is a very difficult ques-
tion to answer either way.
Whether one is trying to
prove or disprove the above
proposition, the class of NP-
complete problems turns out
to be crucial. For, if trying
to prove P=NP
, it would suf-
fice to show that there is a
method which can be used to
solve one of the NP-complete
problems in polynomial time
(remember, an NP-complete
problem is such that all other
NP problems can be reduced
to it). Conversely, if trying
to disprove P=NP
, it would
suffice to demonstrate that
a certain NP-complete prob-
lem is not solvable in polyno-
mial time (one way to do this
would be by showing that the
least time the problem could
be solved in is super-polyno-
mial).
Although this may sound
like a fairly abstract prob-
lem, an affirmative proof
would have potentially stun-
ning practical consequences.
Hundreds of NP-complete
problems are known, many
of them related to schedul-
ing and routing problems
with industrial importance.
For example, there is a prob-
lem concerning the fitting
of oddly shaped items into
a knapsack, which is closely
associated with the question
of placing components on a
circuit board, while the prob-
lem of constructing a work-
ing timetable for a school so
that teachers and students
are never in two places at the
same time is similar to the
problem of placing pilots in
an airline.
Perhaps more importantly,
however, there is the prob-
lem of factorising large num-
bers, which lies at the heart
of modern cryptography.
The codes routinely used to
secure worldwide financial
transactions are complexity-
theory based and, in particu-
lar, the proof of their secu-
rity assumes P is not equal
to NP
. Were it to be proven
that P does equal NP
, current
ciphers could become obso-
lete overnight.
Despite such potentially
destructive consequences,
there are some of a more
positive nature. For exam-
ple, as mentioned earlier, an
affirmative solution to the
problem will allow a compu-
ter to find a formal proof to
any mathematical theorem,
provided it has a proof of rea-
sonable length. More strik-
ingly, it is thought that this
may be applied to other areas
of creative human endeav-
our, such as designing planes,
creating physical theories or
even composing music, as in
each case what is ultimately
required is an efficient meth-
od for recognising a good
result. Finding such meth-
ods is one of the fundamental
problems in artificial intel-
ligence, whose resolution
would be aided by a proof of
the P vs NP question.
With such momentous
implications, it is unsurpris-
ing that many people are
interested in finding a solu-
tion to this particular mil-
lennium problem. Indeed, an
astonishing number of papers
are regularly published pur-
porting to have found a proof.
However, ever since the prob-
lem was initially formulated
in the 1970s, there has been
no success, whatever the line
of attack. This has prompted
speculations that the prob-
lem may be unsolvable after
all and, in particular, Gödel’s
incompleteness theorem has
been invoked. In other words,
it has been suggested that
under our current mathemat-
ical framework of assump-
tions it is not possible to
prove whether P = NP
. Some
have accordingly proposed
that ‘P not equal to NP’ (for
that is what most complex-
ity theorists believe to be the
case) be established as a new
assumption.
Over time, the fact that a
proof definitively settling the
question one way or the other
has failed to materialise, has
lent a somewhat metaphysi-
cal aura to the problem. In
complexity theory circles,
whether P equals NP has
become a matter of belief
rather than a matter of estab-
lished fact. When and if the
problem is finally resolved
(and there is little indication
of this happening in the fore-
seeable future), it is bound to
affect the way we do science.
Perhaps the picture is not
so gloomy though: remember,
all you have to do to solve the
problem and win the prize is
solve the equivalent NP-com-
plete Minesweeper problem,
which boils down to demon-
strating an efficient algorithm
for playing Minesweeper per-
fectly (without unnecessary
guesses)!
Why do the unsolved problems of maths matter?
In the first of a series of articles, Alex Antonov considers the significance of the toughest problems
in mathematics. The P=NP problem is one of the most important of these
“...there is also the
attractive price tag of
$1,000,000 attached
to each of the seven
problems...”
“...an affirmative
proof would have
potentially stunning
consequences”
“Indeed were this
problem to be solved it
is most likely to
furnish the proofs to
the remaining six
millennium problems”
Minesweeper: we’ve all played it, but did you know that it can be formulated as an NP
complete problem, the solution of which would have widespread ramifications?
“...this has prompted
speculation that the
problem may be unsolv-
able, and in particular,
Godel’s incomplete-
ness theorem has been
invoked”
