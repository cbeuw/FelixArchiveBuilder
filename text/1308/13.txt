In recent years it has become
clear that man’s use of fos-
sil fuels is likely to have a
major impact on the world’s
climate. As a result of this,
increased concentrations of
‘greenhouse’ gases such as
carbon dioxide and methane
will lead to global warming;
an overall small increase
in average temperatures;
whose impact is difficult to
predict. Whilst some scien-
tists predict melting of the
polar icecaps, and so a rise
in sea levels, others think this
will be balanced by increased
precipitation at the poles.
1. If we go on using fossil fuels
at the present rate, we must
expect climatic change.
TRUE / FALSE / CAN’T TELL
2. Depletion of the ozone layer
will result in global warming.
TRUE / FALSE / CAN’T TELL
3. Scientists are all agreed
that use of fossil fuels will
eventually lead to a rise in
sea levels.
TRUE / FALSE / CAN’T TELL
4. The burning of fossil fuels
increases the concentration
of methane in the atmos-
phere.
TRUE / FALSE / CAN’T TELL
Answers:
1 TRUE; 2 CAN’T TELL;
3 FALSE; 4 TRUE.
NUMERICAL REASONING
This is a test of your skill
at reasoning with numbers.
First you are given some
information in a variety of
forms – text, tables or graphs
– followed by three related
questions. For each question,
choose what you think is the
correct answer.
An insurance scheme pays
benefits to its members who
are sick for extended periods
of time at the following rates:
1st month: nil
2nd-4th months: 50% of nor-
mal salary
5th and succeeding months:
25% of normal salary
on the first £24,000 p.a. of sal-
ary for each month in which
the member is sick and is not
paid by the employer.
How much does the scheme
pay to:
1. John, who is off work for
two months, whose salary is
£12,000 p.a., and who gets no
sick pay?
2. Pat, who is ill for six months,
but who is paid normally
for the first two months and
whose salary is £18,000 p.a.?
3 Hilary, whose salary is
£30,000 p.a., who gets three
months’ sick pay from her
employer, and who has to
take nine months off?
A) £250 B) £500
C) £750 D) £1000
E) £1125 F) £1500
G) £1765 H) £2125
I) £2250 J) £2350
K) £2500 L) £3125
M) £3750 N) £4000
O) £5000 P) £5625
Answers:
1. Answer B is correct. John
gets £500 (one month at half
his usual monthly salary)
2. Answer I is correct. Pat gets
£2250 (three months at half her
usual monthly salary)
3. Answer N is correct. Hilary
gets £4000 (3 months at half
of a monthly salary of £2000
plus 2 months at a quarter of a
monthly salary of £2000)
ABSTRACT REASONING
This is a test of your skill at
finding similarities and differ-
ences in groups of patterns.
All the patterns in group A
are in some way similar to
each other, and all those in
group B are similar to each
other.
