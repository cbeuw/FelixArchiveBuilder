Did you go to the ICSO concert last
Friday? Those of you who did I’m
sure will agree with me that it was
a very enjoyable evening. For those
of you who didn’t, here’s the review
of what you missed. And for those
of you who are already well and
truly lost: ICSO stands for ‘Imperial
College Symphony Orchestra’.
The programme was as follows:
Berlioz Roman Carnival Overture;
Sibelius Finlandia; Larsson
Concertino for Trombone; and
Tchaikovsky Symphony No.6. After
a brief moment of ‘tisk tisking’ from
general public and the orchestra as
someone’s phone started buzzing,
the concert got underway with the
bright and exuberant Berlioz.
The Berlioz was well executed and
served as a good introduction to
the evening’s concert. The Roman
Carnival Overture was originally
written as the overture to a rather
unsuccessful opera but has thank-
fully survived. The piece is upbeat
and enjoyable, opening with a
beautiful cor anglais solo played by
Charles Craddock.
The Berlioz was followed by
two pieces by Nordic composers,
Sibelius and Larsson. Quite possibly
Finland’s most well known export,
Sibelius is the composer of some
highly emotive music. I’ll be com-
pletely frank and admit that Sibelius
really isn’t one of my favourite com-
posers – his works are quite often
that little bit too emotive for my
tastes and scored in such a way that
more often that not result in my
turning a lovely shade of greenish
grey and reaching for the Panadol.
However, the work played by ICSO,
Finlandia, was wonderfully dark
and brooding and played to perfec-
tion; it almost made me want to
give Sibelius another chance. The
expression of nationalistic senti-
ments of the composer and the peo-
ple of Finland at a time when the
country was under the control of
Russia, Finlandia is a gloriously
grand tone poem.
Hands up those of you familiar
with the works of Larsson. As I
expected, not many. Larsson, 1908–
1986, is a Swedish composer whose
work was influenced by, among oth-
ers, Sibelius. The Concertino for
Trombone is a true showpiece for
the soloist, in this instance Douglas
Murdoch, who covered himself in
glory playing music of astounding
complexity. Apologies to all trom-
bonists out there, but I had no idea
what the instrument was capable
of!
Following a brief interval, ICSO
rearranged themselves once more
to embark on the concert’s grand
finale, Tchaikovsky’s Symphony
No.6 ‘Pathétique’ in B minor. Not
a joyous and triumphant work, the
Tchaikovsky is singularly beautiful
and melancholy. Elegant, as all of
Tchaikovsky’s works are, the sym-
phony was done complete justice by
ICSO’s players, the brass in particu-
lar shining. The fortes were boom-
ing, the crescendos were sweeping,
the decrescendos and pianos heart-
breaking.
The conducting of Richard Dickins
was as full of energy as usual and
raised quite a few comments of con-
cern from my companions for both
his safety and that of the assorted
pieces of sound equipment in the
vicinity. ICSO really did themselves
proud with this concert, as was pat-
ently evident by the stupendously
low level of coughing and sneezing
for the time of year. I realise that
this is something of a useless com-
ment, but it was about time that
the squeaky green stool the timpani
player was perched on was replaced,
so well done to the person who took
care of that – now we can all enjoy
concerts without those occasional
unpleasant squeaks.
The quality of the concert was
extremely high, the repertoire
enlightening and extremely enjoy-
able. Those of you who didn’t go
really missed out on this tour de
force by ICSO.

The closest I have ever been to
being ‘musical’ was playing the
recorder in my school concert aged
13, and that wasn’t even classical. So
I’m writing this review in the eyes of
a non-musician, someone who was
there simply to watch their friends
play and enjoy the music.
St Augustine’s Church is an amaz-
ing venue, and the music filled it.
The Imperial College School of
Medicine (ICSM) Orchestra looked
the part in their matching black
outfits and I knew we would be in
for a treat. Matt Whitaker conducted
the orchestra and this ambitious
programme. This is his second year
conducting them, and it was obvious
that he was enjoying the perform-
ance.
Danse Macabre by Saint-Saens
was the first piece to be played.
Any other non-musicians will know
this as the theme tune to Jonathan
Creek. However, Danse Macabre
played by the ICSM Orchestra in a
magnificent church made the music
sound 100 times better than on the
telly. It was an incredible first piece
and it sent shivers running down
my spine.
Danse Macabre is one of four
symphonic poems. It is an example
of the exotic, descriptive and dra-
matic works written by Saint-Saens,
a French pianist and composer. He
was hailed as the world’s greatest
organist by Gounod, Rossini, Berlioz
and Listz. Zoe Little was the soloist
in this piece, and she excelled in her
part on the violin. Danse Macabre is
a fantastic piece and the orchestra
did it justice.
Mendelssohn’s Violin Concerto in
E minor gave an end to the first half
of music. This was a elegant piece
with a large focus on the soloist
Olivia Shields, a second year medic
who began her violin career at the
age of four and was a finalist in The
National Schools Chamber Music
Competition. She led the symphony
orchestra for two successive years
at St Paul’s Girls’ School and stud-
ies with Rodney Friend at the Royal
College of Music. She is amazing.
This piece is very challenging for
the soloist as it contains an under-
current of agitated semiquavers.
But I could see no faults in her or
the orchestra’s performance. It was
a lovely piece to listen to.
After the interval of wine
and orange juice, we listened to
Tchaikovsky’s Symphony No.5,
composed in the summer of 1888.
In this excellent final piece, the
clarinets gave a low and sombre
theme. Tchaikovsky transforms his
fate theme into a triumphant march
and a happy ending. It was an epic
expression of music and energy, a
sound ending to the concert.
The medics put on an excel-
lent display of music, and Zoe and
Olivia’s solos gave a particular spar-
kle to the performance. I was liter-
ally gobsmacked when they played.
How does someone do a medicine
degree and manage to be that
good? It’s outstanding. Matthew
kept the orchestra together, and
that’s a large task. I enjoyed watch-
ing them play as much as they
enjoyed playing it, judging by the
size of the smiles on their faces.
Everyone must go to their next con-
cert in the spring, I sincerely recom-
mend it.
● Despite Imperial being a science
college, the arts are well and truly
alive here. This week’s reviews
should have given you just a bit of a
taster of what goes on, and there is
plenty more to come as well.
Keeping with music, the choir
have a concert next Friday and
Sinfonietta have one the following
Tuesday, both in the Great Hall.
For those of you not feeling sui-
cidal enough with unreasonable
amounts of work, DramSoc’s pro-
duction of Ibsen’s A Doll’s House
ends on Saturday.
If you didn’t join an arts society
this term don’t worry, they’ll still
take you, in general, next term. So
get involved, and don’t forget that
the Arts Festival will be here next
term.
