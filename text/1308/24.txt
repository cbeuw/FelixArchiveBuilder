FUCWIT Answers:
Issue 1306
Just the two quizzes from us a fort-
night ago, so not many answers for
us to give.
Foot in mouth
Everyone who entered was pretty
good at this, you obviously all spend
way too much time in hairdressers
reading Heat. Answers then:
They lie about me: Michael
Douglas
They’re unfair to me: Christian
Slater

Parton

Ugly XI
A bit of controversy here regarding
mingers who should have made the
first team. There was no way Jim
Leighton, Paul Scholes or Bobby
Charlton deserved to make the first
XI, despite the opinion of some read-
ers.
1. German Burgos
2. Socrates
3. Mark Wright
4. Carlton Palmer
5. Barry Venison
6. Alexei Lalas
7. Emmanuel Petit
8. Jens Jeremies

This little cutie is married to
our baby number two, and has
been in our favourite sitcom of
the past few years.
He’s all the girls’ favourite. He
was last seen in a leather skirt
wandering around the desert
in this spring’s blockbuster.
She’s a Welsh diva, but not in
this picture. She’s got an old
man for a hubby and a baby
or two.
He’s just gorgeous in this pic-
ture, but I cant say that any
more. He raps about drugs and
porn.
She’s blonde, she’s been a
cheerleader and more recently
Spiderman’s lover.
She’s a vampire slayer, that’s
an obvious clue, but she hasn’t
changed anyway.
Aliens have tried to kill her,
but she’s a tough cookie and
survived to tell her tale.
She was famous by this age
already. She’s not that innocent
any more.
Aww look at the ickle-wickle babies below – they’re so cute aren’t they? Who would think they’d grow up to
become Evil Hollywood Scum? Just tell us who they are. So it’s not too hard, I’ve added a few clues to help.
There is two points for each correct answer here, so good luck.
Man vs beast
As Imperial Students, we like to
think that we’re just that little bit
better than our fellow man (UCL),
and that we’re the kings of the (aca-
demic) jungle.
But what about the real jungle,
could we survive then? In the big
wide world, it’s survival of the fittest,
and everything comes down to one
thing – who has the bigger knob.
Suddenly you’re not feeling too
cocky eh? It’s clear that not even
the most smug and self-important
medic, with a God-complex the size
of Essex, seriously thinks that they
have a schlong as long as a whale’s.
So to even things up, or down, we’ve
put them in proportion to each
other. Just tell us which animals
have the biggest wang?
