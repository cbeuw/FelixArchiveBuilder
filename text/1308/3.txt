More oil, anyone?
No doubt the extensive coverage of crude oil prices has given you information
overload. Ben Hasted demystifies all
Welcome to the first of what
will hopefully become rela-
tively regular articles here
in the Felix business section.
Following on from our busi-
ness editor’s brief foray into
crude oil price rises, I felt an
urge to elaborate on the fas-
cinating issues causing the
prices to rise faster than...
well, something rising very
fast!
As I write, oil prices are
about 60% higher than they
were in January. This certain-
ly begs the question, “Why?”
The increase in price has
been caused by several con-
tributing factors, some of
which have been on the front
pages of even the ‘less than
quality’ newspapers.
The demand for oil has
increased worldwide; two
major players are the United
States and China. The US has
a greater need for oil now
that its economic recovery
has gained strength (all those
gas-guzzling SUVs have to get
fuel from somewhere) whilst
China’s economy is expand-
ing at such a rapid rate that
its demand has increased by
20% over the past year.
In the drive for cost-cutting
that all companies undergo
every so often, many oil com-
panies have tried to enhance
efficiency by operating with
lower stocks of crude oil.
These stocks provide a cush-
ion when a supply interrup-
tion occurs for whatever rea-
son, and so it follows that with
less stock comes less cushion
– those supply interruptions
have much more of an impact
on prices now.
OPEC (a producers’ cartel
accountable for about half the
world’s oil exports) tries to
keep oil prices where they
want them by decreasing or
increasing the supply of oil
to the market. In the past,
they tended to wait for a price
dip before cutting output, but
recently they have been act-
ing more aggressively and
have tried to pre-empt weak-
ening of prices by cutting out-
put early.
Political tensions through-
out the Middle East, which
remains the main source of
oil for the world’s major con-
sumers, and violence in Iraq
have undermined confidence
in the security of supply from
the region. Iraqi exports have
actually been cut by sabo-
tage attacks on oil facilities,
and whilst the reduction in
exports is relatively small, it
has concerned analysts and
cast doubt over Iraq’s future
as a stable oil exporter.
This lack of confidence, and
the possibility (some would
say certainty) of further vio-
lence in the Middle East,
expose the market to sud-
den price rises if supplies are
threatened. Speculators are
very much aware of this and
are betting on higher prices.
This in turn exacerbates the
price pressure in the market,
and OPEC officials have even
gone so far as to blame specu-
lators for the price surge this
year.
There are other factors,
such as the US’ lack of refining
capabilities: environmental
regulations demand different
grades of gasoline, varying
from state to state, making
catering for these different
markets difficult. This, along
with environmental concerns
about building new refineries,
can make planning permis-
sion expensive and difficult
to obtain. Combine this with
worries about the stability of
Nigeria, Norway and Russia’s
oil production and you have a
good many reasons for hikes
in prices.
Recently, oil prices did take
a small dip when reports
arrived of an unexpected
increase in US oil stocks,
but analysts remain far from
optimistic in hopes for stead-
ily falling prices. One analyst
said: “A cold snap or a prob-
lem somewhere or other and
we could easily revisit those
high levels,” so let’s keep our
fingers crossed for a hot win-
ter worldwide!
As you can see, there is
no one contributing factor to
the increase in oil prices and,
unfortunately for us, the best
we can do at the moment is
hope that the US sells all its
SUVs and world peace hap-
pens tomorrow!

Further Flight Fight
MyTravel, the troubled holi-
day group, revealed last week-
end that it faces the prospect
of being fined thousands of
pounds by the FSA, the UK
financial services regulatory
body. The announcement
came amid a restructuring of
MyTravel’s £800m debt, much
of which is held by bondhold-
ers Lehman Brothers and
Fidelity. Although the bond-
holders voted against the
restructuring, a high court
ruling approved the subse-
quent plea and allowed a
debt-for-equity exchange, a
mechanism allowing the firm
to free itself from debt but
keep the capital raised from
the initial bond issue.
Viktor vs Viktor
Judges in Ukraine have
halted the crowning of Viktor
Yanukovych, the recently
elected Ukrainian prime
minister, after mass rebel-
lion by eastern Ukraine and
his opposition leader, Viktor
Yushchenko. The immediate
appointment of Yanukovich
could have led to civil war
after there were rumours of
a fraudulent election and arti-
ficially created poll results.
A difference of 2.85% caused
the stir and subsequent mass
strikes that have demand-
ed the attention of the US,
European Union govern-
ments and Nato.
Chaudhry’s rating
Chaudhry anticipates a move
upwards in the FTSE 100
index over the coming weeks
as the dollar continues to
weaken and hence increases
the cost for exporters from
the UK. However, EU export-
ers will feel the strain as the
euro continues to strengthen
against both the pound and
dollar. Although this is by no
means the only reason for
markets to move, we should
expect the FTSE Euro 100
to dip.

Entrepreneurs Challenge
Manager
This is the question that ten
lucky Imperial students will
have to answer on Thursday
9 December.
The Entrepreneurs’ Chall-
enge, now in its fifth year,
is one of the world’s biggest
student business plan compe-
titions. The ‘Ideas Challenge’,
the first part of the competi-
tion, ran this term and asked
for a 2-3 page summary of
a business idea. Ten £1000
prizes and ten £250 prizes are
awarded to the winners at
this stage.
Next year, the ‘New
Business Challenge’ offers
students the opportunity to
present a full business plan
for a chance to win the first
prize of £25,000 in cash and
services, one of two runners-
up prizes of £5,000 in cash and
services, or a finalist cash
prize of £1000.
Come and show your
support to your fellow stu-
dents and find out who this
year’s Ideas Challenge prize
winners are. Don’t forget
to join us afterwards to cel-
ebrate with festive drinks
and snacks in the Tanaka
Business School!
David Begg, Principal of the
Tanaka Business School, will
be awarding the prizes to this
year's winners and runners-
up. Which ideas will the judg-
es find the most innovative
and convincing this year? You
can judge for yourself as the
ten winners try to convince
you of their idea through their
elevator pitches.
The Challenge is open to
all Imperial College students,
undergraduate and post-
graduate, and is run by the
Entrepreneurship Centre in
the Tanaka Business School.
Students do not need to have
prior business or commercial
experience to enter. Previous
winners have come from a
variety of departments,
including physics, medicine,
mechanical engineering,
industrial design engineering
and biological sciences.
Teams that have taken
part in the Entrepreneurs’
Challenge have been suc-
cessful in London-wide as
well as international busi-
ness plan competitions, prov-
ing Imperial’s students to be
among the best at developing
and presenting ideas. Some
teams have also gone on to
raise investment capital to
make their businesses a real-
ity.
The competition attracts
companies such as McKinsey,
IBM, Psion, Shell, HP
, HSBC,
Barclays Capital, Amadeus
Capital and Innocent Drinks
to sponsor the competition or
pass on their expertise to our
students, meaning entrants
have a wealth of experience
available to them as they
put their business plans
together.
What would you do with £1000?
The Ferrari Scaglietti 612: the term ‘gas guzzler’ is an understatement for this £150,000 beaut. Taking it down to Harrods
and back would cost you £14, and that’s without making any purchases from Mr El Fayed
