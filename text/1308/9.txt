This summer I rediscovered a
country where convenience has not
driven out variety, a country where
sameness is not the everyday norm.
I travelled to Sri Lanka and
entered an unfamiliar world. This
beautiful, intriguing and contrast-
ing country – where the landscape
changes from long yellow stretches
of beaches with turquoise sea to arid
dry cactus deserts and mountain-
ous regions where people dress in
woolly hats and jumpers – made me
question the world I have become
accustomed to.
My most memorable experi-
ence was visiting Kataragama,
a unique pilgrimage site in Sri
Lanka for Buddhists, Hindus and
Muslims. Within an enclosed area,
mosques and temples group togeth-
er. Chanting, bells, drums and the
Islamic call to prayer harmoniously
fill the air. I found this particularly
thought provoking with regard to
today’s social climate.
Sri Lanka’s history is fascinat-
ing, with ancient monuments to
rival those of Machu Picchu. These
include King Kasyappa’s fifth cen-
tury AD palace on top of a 600ft
rock. Entering this palace would
have involved climbing up spiralling
stairs carved into the rock and, at
the top, stepping through the mouth
of a huge statue lion. On top, one can
see the huge throne where the King
would have sat watching his 500 con-
cubines drinking and dancing.
The Sri Lankans are exception-
ally friendly and always smiling.
Everyone wanted to say ‘hello’ and
one endearing girl asked, ‘Do you
mind if we speak English for a while
please?’ London Underground eti-
quette made me first ignore these
questions, but gradually I learnt the
virtue of conversation.
Inevitably I found myself back on
the plane. Now, even the adverts of
the in-flight magazine, where the
cowboy rides across Marlboro coun-
try breathing in lungfuls of fresh air
but not cigarette smoke, seemed
ridiculous. Arriving at the airport,
Starbucks’ new campaign slogan
encouraging consumer imagina-
tion, ‘Be creative, choose your shot’,
seemed absurd for carbon-copy cof-
fee shops with no individuality.
Countries all across the world
are settling into the same. Body
Shops and Hiltons are found in large
numbers. Convenience has driven
out variety. Which American mall
doesn’t have JC Penney, Radio
Shack and Haagen Dazs? Which
British high street doesn’t have
Marks and Spencer, Boots, WH
Smith and Topshop? And when you
come across these shops abroad,
your first response is not a flash of
pleasant recognition but a dull sense
that you have not reached anywhere
different at all.
There are only a handful of places
on Earth where you can escape all
this completely. To the extent of my
knowledge, there is no McDonalds
in Cuba and no Coca-Cola in Libya.
In Sri Lanka, I only counted two
McDonalds and one KFC, all in
Colombo. At least in this country, for
the time being, diversity and unique-
ness are still present.
Sameness afflicts our lives, some-
times without us realizing it when
we are absorbed in our daily rou-
tines. Invariably today’s craziness
for sameness will be transformed
into tomorrow’s rational order,
which then will become a new and
perfectly workable basis for society.
Hopefully we will not forget the need
for contrast and unpredictability. If
you desire a fresh perspective, I
recommend visiting Sri Lanka to
celebrate and welcome difference
and complexity.

Sameness
● Colin Smith is the Welfare
Campaigns Officer of Imperial
College Union. However, this
article consists of his own
personal opinions and not
necessarily those of Imperial
College Union or of Felix
As reported a year ago in the 5
December 2003 issue of Felix, and
in many other newspapers, a mem-
ber of Imperial College IT staff was
arrested three days earlier in a
‘counter-terrorist’ operation. What is
not known, and has not been report-
ed, is what has happened since.
The member of staff was Babar
Ahmad. He was born and raised
in London. After obtaining a mas-
ters degree in engineering from
Imperial, he went on to work in
the Mechanical Engineering depart-
ment.
At 5.50am on 2 December, Babar,
a practising Muslim, was woken up
by eight riot police who took him
to Charing Cross police station.
His friends and supporters believe
that he was abused by police offic-
ers. After six days of interrogation,
Babar was released without charge
– there was no evidence against
him. Photographs taken in cus-
tody, as well as a more detailed
look at the case, can be found at
www.freebabarahmad.co.uk.
But the story doesn’t end there.
Babar was rearrested on 5 August
this year, and is still being held in
Woodhill Prison in Milton Keynes.
He has been described by news-
papers as ‘Bin Laden’s right hand
man’. The allegations and evidence
of his involvement with terrorism
of any form amount to very little.
One of the main pieces of evidence
is a tourist brochure advertising
the Empire State Building that was
found in his house. This belongs
to his father Ashfaq Ahmad, who
visited the landmark in the 1970s
and has the photographs and visa
to prove it.
The evidence is in fact so flimsy
that he cannot be tried in Britain.
For this reason, he was arrested
under an extradition warrant from
the United States. New legislation,
forced through by Home Secretary
David Blunkett, means that the US
can demand the extradition of a
British citizen without evidence and
on the basis of allegations alone. This
is particularly worrying considering
that the British legal system will
now accept evidence given under
torture (providing it has not been
carried out by a British institution).
All this in spite of the US’s systemat-
ic human rights abuses of prisoners
in Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo Bay,
and elsewhere.
The case of Babar Ahmad is not
an isolated one. Since 11 September
2001, the number of times Muslims
have been stopped and searched by
police has risen dramatically, but
only a tiny percentage of the hun-
dreds arrested under anti-terror
laws have actually been convicted.
It seems that this racist victimisa-
tion and intimidation of Muslims is
another face of the so-called ‘war
on terror’ that is widely believed
by people outside the current gov-
ernment to have actually made the
world more susceptible to terror-
ism. In order to try to justify the
other face of this permanent global
war, the massacre of 100,000 peo-
ple in Iraq (as reported recently in
the respected medical journal The
Lancet), the Government here is
trying desperately to create a cli-
mate of fear where terrorists are
constantly in our midst.
But this is not an issue that affects
just Muslims. The stop and search
figures for afro-carribeans have
risen by 200% since 11 September
2001. And if our own Babar Ahmad
is extradited to the US (a country
with the death penalty, let us not
forget), on the grounds that the
British legal system is not as fair
or effective as the American one,
then it sets a very dangerous
precedent.
That is why it is vitally impor-
tant that as many people from as
many backgrounds as possible get
involved with the campaign for
Babar’s release. He was a student
and staff member here, and many
people at Imperial knew him per-
sonally. We all need to rally together
to defend our civil liberties, which
are being eroded on almost a
daily basis. The proposed intro-
duction of compulsory ID cards is
yet another aspect of this war on civil
liberties which looks set to become a
reality at sometime in the future. So,
I would encourage everyone to join
Babar’s father, campaigning jour-
nalist Yvonne Ridley, and others, to
launch this campaign at Imperial, in
a meeting taking place tonight:
‘Stop the War of Terror, Stop the
War on Civil Liberties – Free Babar
Ahmad’, 6.00pm, tonight (Thursday 2
December), Sir Alexander Fleming
Building, Lecture Theatre 1.
Today it is Babar Ahmad.
Tomorrow it could be you.
