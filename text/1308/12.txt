Test yourself!
By Gabriella Silvestri
Careers Editor
Applications and interviews
are only part of the story,
unfortunately! There is much
more involved in getting
the job you want, and much
depends on the company or
organization you are apply-
ing for.
The first interview will
focus on your knowledge and
ability to do the job, togeth-
er with your motivation. If
you pass this stage, you may
be offered the job or have
to face a second interview
or assessment centre, which
may include making a pres-
entation, doing aptitude or
psychometric tests, and par-
ticipating in group exercises
or discussions.
Psychometric tests are big
in recruitment these days.
More and more organiza-
tions are using these tests at
a much earlier stage in the
selection process, and they
are carefully designed for
the role for which you have
applied.
The ‘psycho-’ bit in ‘psy-
chometric’ could have some
unpleasant connotations,
but all it means is that the
test assesses a characteris-
tic that is something to do
with psychology or how your
brain works – usually some
aspect of intelligence or per-
sonality. The ‘-metric’ bit
means that the test gives a
measurement of the relevant
characteristic(s), ie it gives
a numerical score that tells
you how much of it you have,
or how you compare to other
people.
There are two types – apti-
tude tests and personality
questionnaires. Aptitude tests
are designed to measure your
intellectual capabilities for
thinking and reasoning, par-
ticularly, your logical and ana-
lytical reasoning abilities. The
most commonly used tests
assess verbal and numerical
logical reasoning skills.
In contrast, personality
questionnaires are not timed,
don’t have ‘right answers’
and feel less like an exam.
Personality questionnaires
give more complex infor-
mation and are interpreted
by people who are specially
trained to do this. Whenever
these tests are used, the
information they give should
be put together with all the
other information gathered
about you – even employers
know that there is more to a
person than a number!
Tests are used by many
employers across most sec-
tors, including IT, consultan-
cy, many areas of the public
sector, consumer goods and
retail, banking, engineering
and so on. Without practice,
you will surely perform below
your true potential. Don’t
assume you’ll be OK just
because you have maths A
level. There are some prac-
tice questions below for start-
ers. And practice questions
usually appear with the letter
that you receive inviting you
to the testing process or on
the company website. Be pre-
pared... to challenge yourself!
VERBAL REASONING
This is a test of your skill
at making sense of reports
that cannot be relied on to
be objective, truthful or even
consistent. The test consists
of a series of short passag-
es, each of which includes a
number of short statements
intended to convey informa-
tion or persuade the reader of
a point of view.
Each passage is accom-
panied by four statements
relating to the information
or arguments it contains.
Assume that what is stated
is true, even if it contradicts
what you know or believe to
be the case in reality. Decide
on this assumption whether
the statement is:
a) true
b) false
c) you cannot tell and need
more information.

When I first came across
Teach First I didn’t look into it
any further. The word ‘teach’
switched off my curiosity,
being something I’ve never
considered doing, mainly
because it seems that teach-
ers get a fairly raw deal.
But the name of this
scheme doesn’t fully convey
what it’s all about. The more
I read about it, the greater my
disappointment that it wasn’t
around when I graduated
– I’m stuck in the middle of a
PhD and can’t apply! It sounds
an excellent programme that
will potentially equip you to
go anywhere you want in life.
The website states: “Teach
First unashamedly expects
many of its participants to
become the future Ministers,
CEOs and serial entrepre-
neurs of our age”.
The idea behind Teach First
is to develop the leaders of the
future. Two intensive years
are spent teaching in second-
ary schools, while receiving
leadership, management and
business skills training. The
list of Teach First supporters
is impressive, including many
of the big financial, IT, consul-
tancy and law firms as well as
Government and Civil Service
offices and the main politi-
cal parties. These supporters
offer mentoring, networking
and internship opportunities
to participants.
If it sounds good so far then
read the following article by
the manager of graduate
recruitment at Teach First,
Angi Bhole.
Be different, make a
difference
Teach First is a groundbreak-
ing management develop-
ment programme for high-
calibre graduates. It com-
bines leadership and business
skills training with teaching
in challenging London sec-
ondary schools. The aim is to
transform exceptional gradu-
ates into inspiring leaders.
Based on a US idea, Teach
First recruits graduates to
enter a rewarding two-year
programme in which they
will train, qualify and work as
teachers in some of London’s
most demanding schools.
Unique opportunity
The programme is successful
because it delivers a unique
career and leadership devel-
opment opportunity, support-
ed by over 70 of the UK’s
most prestigious employers.
All these companies – public
bodies, charities and govern-
ment agencies – recognise
and value the skills and expe-
rience developed in teaching.
Jo Owen, a former part-
ner with Accenture and
Capgemini, explains: “Future
leaders learn early on the
tough skills of managing peo-
ple, leadership, initiative and
entrepreneurialism. Teach
First helps graduates gain
these skills – skills for a life-
time that lead to the top.”
Fast track to success
Participants benefit from a
unique fast track into teach-
ing. “You’re right in there
at the deep end – there’s no
wasted time,” explains Susie
Wooldridge, an Edinburgh
University English graduate.
“It’s the hardest thing I‘ve
ever done but I was well pre-
pared and now that I’ve got
through the first year I feel I
could do anything.”
The programme focuses
exclusively on challenging
schools and it takes a com-
bination of commitment, self-
belief, humour and energy to
make progress. “Every les-
son is a performance,” says
Edinburgh geography gradu-
ate Sam Dickinson. “It takes
a lot out of you but at the end
of one period you just have to
let it go, reset the clock and
go again.”
Participants start teaching
after just six weeks of inten-
sive training at Canterbury
Christ Church University
College, England’s leading
teacher training institute.
It’s a steep learning curve
but each participant receives
ongoing coaching and men-
toring from experienced
teaching professionals. At the
end of year one, successful
participants achieve Qualified
Teacher Status (QTS). So,
whatever they decide to do
immediatelyafterTeachFirst,
they can return to teaching at
any point in the future.
Leadership training
In their second year, partici-
pants attend the Foundations
of Leadership course. Teach
First has drawn on the exper-
tise and resources of its many
supporters, along with the
Tanaka Business School at
Imperial College, to develop
this innovative course, which
combines skills training,
internship and networking
opportunities with mentor-
ing by sector professionals. It
builds to the Foundations of
Leadership certificate.
Graduates are drawn to
Teach First for a variety of
reasons. Some find it a useful
tool in helping them make
their minds up about future
direction; others know exact-
ly what they want to do and
feel that Teach First will give
them an edge. Either way, the
programme is an enormously
rewarding experience and
one that helps them discover
their own potential.
Pedram Parasmand, a
Physics graduate from
Imperial College, crystallises
the experience: “When you
know that you’ve got through
to someone and helped them
understand, it makes the
hairs on the back of your neck
stand up.”

Candidates are assessed as
and when applications are
received, therefore early
application is recommended,
and the final deadline is 18
March 2005. You’ll need at
least a 2.1 in a subject that
aligns with one of the National
Curriculum subjects, and be
prepared – the selectioncri-
teria are described as being
“among the most rigorous
of any employer, and ensure
that Teach First partici-
pants are among the top 3%
of graduates”. This really is
for the high flyers of tomor-
row. Imperial students may
have a slight advantage as
Teach First are particular-
ly interested in candidates
able to teach science, maths
and technology related
subjects.
Are you a future leader?
