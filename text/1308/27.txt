Imperial Women’s 1st 40
Westminster
Women’s 1st 33
By Candy Fisher
After a disappointing result
last week, we renewed
our sprits for our second
home BUSA match of the
season, this time against
Westminster.
With a fantastic perform-
ance from the entire team,
we led throughout the
match, eventually winning
by 40 points to 33. The team
is finally beginning to work
together even with the squad
only technically consisting of
six players at the moment
due to injuries!
The first quarter saw us get
off to a flying start, quickly tak-
ing a four goal lead. With our
central play much improved,
our captain Alberta worked
the ball up the court effort-
lessly with the help of Stux at
wing attack, a change from
her normal position. They fed
the ball into the shooters who
were both on fire – hardly a
single shot was off target!
The second and third
quarters were fairly evenly
matched, and while we
couldn’t pull away, we didn’t
let them eat into our lead
either. Defence was tight
from the whole team, and we
stayed positive despite the
match feeling like it was at
stalemate.
The last quarter saw the
usual scrappy end you always
get in a close match like this,
but thankfully they cracked
before we did, and we were
able to slightly extend our
lead before the final whistle.
Our team is finally being to
take shape, and with two out
of two home wins, we just
need to figure out how to win
away...

Another win for Firsts
BUSA Short Course
Championships,
Sheffield
By Sakura Hingley
This year, for the first time
in the Swimming Club’s his-
tory, Imperial College was
represented at the BUSA
Short Course Swimming
Championships.
The team consisted of nine
swimmers with a variety of
swimming experience. Some
were regular competitors,
while others had never com-
peted in a large venue such
as Ponds Forge in Sheffield,
where the competition was
taking place.
The first session began
at 6pm on the Friday after-
noon, with the 800m freestyle,
swum by Sophie Mitchinson,
and the 200m freestyle relay
events. Considering that we
missed the warm-up due
to the appalling traffic, all
events were swum superbly,
especially by the boys’ team
who showed their sprinting
strength.
Sessions two and three
on the Saturday also dem-
onstrated the strength that
the Imperial swimmers have
been building up to over
the last couple of months in
preparation for the competi-
tion: Sarah, Sakura and Jon
all powered through the 200m
with respectable times, while
there were brilliant sprints
swum by Alison and Hugh
in the 50m breaststroke and
Jonathan in the 50m back-
stroke.
The afternoon also showed
promising swims from other
team members. Dan was
placed in a fast heat and
showed his backstroke power
whilst Gianluca, although a
bit wobbly at the start, shot
through the 50m freestyle.
The proudest moment for
the team came when Sophie
Mitchinson qualified for the
200m backstroke final, which
was swum that evening. All
the team were present on
poolside as she walked to
her block and her name was
announced: “Representing
Imperial College, Sophie
Mitchinson”. Pride and joy
filled us all. Sophie did the
Imperial name proud by
swimming a wonderful time
of 2:31.10 and is now ranked
tenth fastest BUSA 200m
backstroke swimmer 2004.
For the last day of competi-
tion, Sunday, everyone clam-
bered back to the pool side
in dribs and drabs, tired from
the day(s) before. The heats
were swum in the morning,
including Gianluca swimming
the 100m freestyle; Rodrigo
and Hugh both slightly disap-
pointed by their 100m breast-
stroke swims; Daniel swim-
ming a good 200m IM; Sarah
and Alison proving their
strength in the 50m butterfly;
and Jon very pleased with
a new personal best for his
100m backstroke.
Due to her time entered for
the 400m freestyle, Sophie
was entered into the fast-
est heat, which meant that
she once again managed to
get into a final (as the fast-
est heat was to be swum in
the finals in the afternoon).
Despite being disappointed
by her own time, she touched
the wall in eighth place, again
raising the level of success
higher for the Imperial team.
After a strenuous but excit-
ing and successful three days
for the nine Imperial swim-
mers, it was back to the min-
ibus for another long drive
back to London. Everyone
had had a brilliant weekend
and was ready to get back
into the water for more vigor-
ous training to prepare for
the next trip to Ponds Forge
– the BUSA Long Course
Championships in February.

mation on when and where

that game.
Disc Doctors 6
Sussex Mohawks 3
DD showed a lack of focus
initially against a Mohawks
team which had a few very
competent experienced and
intermediate players. We
suffered from throwaways
and drops (Cripple dropped
a pitch-length hammer from
Magic), but some stunning
corner cuts by Stylish, and
solid handling from Captain
Neville and Magic, raised our
game and resulted in a win.
Disc Doctors 3
Brunel Stop Throwing
Discs (STD) I 8
We knew this was going to
be tough. Brunel have some
very accomplished handlers,
complemented with very
nippy tall beginners. We were
far too slow in noticing and
reacting to their variant of
the horizontal stack, and
suffered as a result of some
cheeky break-force scoobers
by Brunel’s handlers.
Disc Doctors 5
East Anglia Aye-Aye II 6
We went into this one with
the wrong attitude. We
walked all over this team at
outdoor regionals in March,
and thought we could do the
same again indoors. Things
started going wrong as soon
as the game started. Aye Aye
2 had many faces we recog-
nised from years before, and
put strong pressure on from
the start, resulting in throwa-
ways from our men with big
throws, and a notable foot
point-block against Neville.
We traded points for most of
the game, we had difficulty
hearing “up” and “man-on”
calls because Aye Aye 1 and
2 drowned out all other noise
(they won the “loudest team
award”), and lost in sudden
death.
THE PARTY
After spending an hour walk-
ing into Brighton after taking
a bus from our host’s campus,
six of us settled for a KFC fat-
feast, while Stylish, Steve-O
and Boon hunted down an
eat-in curry house. The hosts’
party in Brighton’s Lectern
pub followed. This venue is
surely a contender for the
‘dingiest pub in the south
east award’. It was grotty,
half-painted, it had bin-liners
for curtains, it had an inex-
plicably sticky carpet, and
the prices horrified our team,
which was used to Southside
special offers.
Our friends from Thrown
(the KCL Ultimate team)
invited us to join them at
Casablanca Jazz Club on
Brighton’s seafront. Five of
us went along and experi-
enced three and a half hours
of amazing funk, sprinkled
with some jazzy house, Daft
Punk, Jacko, Dee-lite, and the
Beastie Boys, served-up by a
DJ working behind the front
half of a VW Beetle.
DAY TWO
Disc Doctors 8
Brunel STD II 1
Our first games on Sundays
are historically our worst. We
were fortunate, however, and
given a bit of space to make
mistakes, partly thanks to
K-man making several good
D’s at the back, allowing us
a comfortable win against
Brunel’s second team.
Disc Doctors 13
Cambridge Strange
Blue II 2
This game involved some
seriously sexy play from the
Disc Doctors. We had good
flow and eye contact, and
played our best Ultimate
of the weekend. The score-
line did not do credit to
Strange Blue II, who put up a
good fight throughout, in
what was a very well-spirited
game.
Disc Doctors 6
KCL Thrown 7
We were taken aback by the
intensity of KCL
’s offensive
play. We could not use lack
of indoors practice, lack of
experience playing as a team,
or even the increasingly
dusty and slippery floor as
excuses, because KCL were
in the same position as us.
Points were traded through-
out despite top play from
Naiff, and the game ended in
sudden death, again, with a
throwaway close to our zone
and quick turnaround from
Kings to win the game.
THE RESULT
So we finished tenth in our
region. We were served a
healthy portion of concen-
trated humble pie purée last
weekend. We’ve sucked it
up, and now we’re ready to
spit it out. Our outdoor game
has always been better than
our indoor game, and with
the new beginner talent we’ve
recruited and numerous
one-day open and student
tournaments to be held in
London, the Disc Doctors
will doubtless soon earn the
title of “most feared up and
coming team in the south
east”.

Imperial Men’s 7th 4
Queen Mary Men’s 5th 2
By Sam Styles
Imperial Sevenths started
with their revolutionary new
5-4-1 formation which has
halted a run of six defeats in
a row and led to wins in the
last two fixtures.
Clearly the better of the two
teams in the opening stages,
Imperial dominated the first
20 minutes. As the pressure
mounted, a goal seemed inev-
itable. It came at the wrong
end, however, as in the 20th
minute QM broke quickly with
a long ball through to their
number 10. With the Imperial
defence’s usually highly effec-
tive tactic of appealing loudly
for offside when a striker is
through on goal impressing
neither referee nor linesman,
Ario was left helpless at the
back as the striker made it
1-0 to QM.
Thegamesettledintoamore
even pattern after the goal as
QM grew in confidence, and
it looked as though Imperial
would find themselves 1-0
down at half-time. But two
quick Imperial goals before
the break ensured this would
not be the case and gave the
Sevenths a deserved half-
time lead. Firstly Thom fed
Jack who, one on one with the
keeper, unselfishly squared
the ball to the supporting
Ryan who stroked the ball
into the unguarded goal. Five
minutes later Stefan made a
surging run from centre half.
Intercepting on the halfway
line, he beat three men on a
charge up the left touchline
before smashing the ball past
the ‘keeper.
The second half was a much
scrappier affair, with the QM
team pushing forward with-
out ever really threatening
the Imperial goal. The QM
defence was sitting very high
up the pitch, and this was
exploited in the 55th minute
when Geordie found Leo on
the right wing. Leo beat his
man before dribbling into the
box and shooting low into the
far corner, 3-1 Imperial. More
pressure followed as Geordie
hit the corner of post and bar
with a sweet curler from 30
yards and Tuan shot straight
at the keeper when clean
through.
Twice this season Imperial
have thrown 3-1 leads away
to lose 4-3, and it looked
as if we could be punished
for our poor finishing yet
again as QM pulled a goal
back. However, any fears
of the Sevenths throwing
yet another lead away were
extinguished almost imme-
diately by the QM ‘keeper,
who, having seemingly com-
pleted a comfortable save,
somehow contrived to throw
Geordie’s 25-yard left-footed
drive through his legs and
into the net.
