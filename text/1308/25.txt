I, on the other hand, am Snufkin,
a resident of Moominvalley and a
player of the mouth-organ. The puz-
zle before your eyes is supposed to
bring you pleasure, not pain. So if
you do feel tortured, you must email
me to say so.
We’ve now covered most of the
tricks you can expect to come across.
You should also watch out for clues
relying on homophones (words that
sound alike), as indicated by, eg,
‘we hear’. There are a few of these
amongst the down clues this week.
Good luck! Snufkin
Felix Crossword 1308 by Snufkin
FUCWITs
Things are looking a bit more com-
petitive this week as we were forced
to ban the Management Slackers
from the football / quotes quiz, due
to their eerily close ties to the Felix
office. This has given the rest of you
an ideal chance to catch up and to
even things out a bit.
Well done to the winners of a cou-
ple of weeks ago, The Illegitimate
Bionic Progeny of Jeremy Beadle.
And comiserations go out to Team
Willy J, representing my old hall,
and doing a really shitty job of it too,
managing an embarrassing score of
8. Even a geologist could do better.
This week:
Man vs Beast: Two points if you
get the animal in the right place.
Just one if you’re pretty close.
Hollywood’s Finest: Two points
for each bairn identified.

Three of the most celebrated cross-
Welcome to the first (of one, prob-
ably) of our Coffee Break celebrity
interviews. This week we don’t quite
have the pleasure of bringing to you
the man whose philosophy rivals
that of Descarte, whose musical
skills rival Texas and whose dancing
outshines MC Hammer... Mr David
Brent.
I know what you’re probably think-
ing, “He’s not very high profile” or “I
thought he plummeted into oblivion
at the end of that crap documentary
on BBC”. And you’d be right.
In fact, these column inches are
an attempt to relaunch his chance
at fame and fortune in the music
industry. After that single, we had a
few questions to ask…
[Just fill in the gaps yourself and
email your witty answers to the
usual address. Once again, points if
you make us laugh, and even bonus
points if your responses resemble a
Brent-ism]
So, what have you been doing
since your embarrassing exit
from Wernham Hogg?
Let me just stop you there, I’ve had
this conversation before and I’ve
explained that the BBC edited the
footage and they had to portray me
as a _____1 and _____2, whereas in
reality I am in fact highly _____ 3
and extremely _____4.
Well, we were only referring
to your departure from our
screens when you were ‘made
redundant’, but if you want
to talk about that then go
ahead.
Made redundant? We had a differ-
ence of opinion. Neil wanted to make
some changes and he couldn't han-
dle a mutiny, so he just took the
______ 5 way out, making me the
_____6. Really it was the opportu-
nity I always needed to ______7 .
Anything else?
So what have you been do-
ing with your time? Any more
guest appearances?
No I've given that up now – that's the
Brent of the past. That Brent was a
_____ 8 who was obsessed with ___
___9. I'm like that Christmas book
– there's the ghost of Brent past, the
ghost of Brent present and the ghost
of David Brent to come. Except I'm
not a ghost. And I don't appear to old
men at night. Right now I'm cross-
ing over [makes crossing motion
with arms] from the present to the
future. I’m... preparing. There’s a lot
in the pipeline.
Like what?
Without wanting to give too much
away, there's a _____ 10 job which
I've been asked to work on for ____
__11, plus I've got some of my own
______ 12 that I've been throwing
together, so to speak.
Does any of this involve fur-
thering your music or dancing
career?
Well I have been approached by
a number of ______ 13 regarding
my, quote, “impressive dancing
abilities” and whether I was inter-
ested in taking it further. Obviously
I was more than flattered, but I
had to look at it from the point of
Michael Flatley, I had to be ‘The
Lord of the Dance’. I realised that
it wasn't always _____ 14 and that
like Michael I would probably peak
early; I wouldn't be able to deal with
_____15. With the musical side of
things I don't think people are ready
for the Brentmeister General just
yet, I'm too _____ 16 for them. I've
had to put the music industry on the
back burner.
Any last words?
I don't say last words. First words
are better. Except in an argument
obviously. But if I had to then I'd
probably say, in the words of a great
comedian: “Dying is easy. Comedy
is difficult”. Yeah. Not that I'm dying
of course.
Brent is a self-taught exponent of interpretive dance

entertainer’
