Felix Editor: Adam Harrington
A s Editor of Felix, one of the best student
newspapers i n the country, I intend to
liase with other L o n d o n colleges to
produce a n integrated v i e w of all news
relevant to Imperial students. In addition,
I would like t o encourage students of St.
Mary's to get more involved i n
contributing to Felix, and b y so doing
increase the publication's relevance to
them.
Though m u c h of Felix is of a high
quality, there is still r o o m for change.
There is a lot of potential for effective
and readable use of English, building o n
the already high standard set i n previous
years.
More prominence should be given to
news, and an increase i n coverage can be
made b y introducing more people to
reporting. News should be impartial and
accurate, and reporters should not be
misled b y obdurate bureaucrats.
There are m a n y cases where students
have been victims of this college's
complacency, inefficiency or carelessness.
Students often feel they can't overcome it
because of fear for their degree a n d the
belief that they would be ignored. Felix
can exert pressure o n behalf of students
against the U n i o n or the College w h e n
either behave invidiously.
Felix has long been k n o w n for the
quality of its arts reviews. This should be
continued and encouraged as it is an
important service to students. I would like
to compile a weekly list of activities
outside the college i n addition to this.
In the knowledge that I cannot be
aware of all the needs of IC students I
would always be open to suggestion from
anybody as to how the publication could
be improved. It would b e a positive
benefit that such suggestions come from
outside the group of volunteers w o r k i n g
on Felix.
President: Michael Newman
At twenty seven years of age Michael
N e w m a n has done more than most
people do i n a lifetime.
He obtained his degree i n Zoology i n
1986. During his undergraduate years, at
Imperial, he was best k n o w n for his
active role i n the debating society and
H.G.Wells Soc, & for his organisation of
big name speaker meetings.
Michael organised a pressure group,
campaigning for women's health issues,
w h i c h gained the support of over 100
M.P.'s. H e chaired the groups press
conference, held i n the House of
Commons, at w h i c h M.P.'s from all parties
spoke.
He has taken leave from his job as a
school teacher to study for an MSc i n the
'History of Science' here at Imperial.
A s a school teacher i n Bradford he
Chemistry and Biology.
He was the first teacher o n a DTI
enterprise scheme and has received
substantial funds from industry for school
activities he has designed. A t present he
is making a video about schools and
industry w h i c h will be supplied to all
schools i n Bradford.
Michael's achievements led to him
being appointed as public relations officer
for his school despite his y o u n g age.
Michael N e w m a n has clearly shown he
is capable of putting original ideas into
practise and I therefore feel he will make
an excellent U n i o n President.
I a m standing because I a m an idealist.
W h e n I plan a project and put it into
effect I do so not only w i t h short term,
realisable objectives but w i t h a well-
defined philosophical aim. This aim not
only motivates m e it gives direction,
coherence and a reason to the things I
do.
A s President I will N O T be a
management trainee seeing success as
merely keeping things efficiently running.
I will introduce sweeping changes into
our Union and college. See m y

President: Adrian Johnson
The Proposer's bit
Err, Rob's proposing m e (or at least he
said he would w h e n I asked h i m half a n
hour ago), and as he is an ex-RSM
President, I think that says something (it
says he's very tall). Rob has k n o w n m e
for a number of years and thinks I'm jolly
wizzo and groovy, but he's far too busy
to lower himself to write this sort of crap.
So, Rob says 'Vote for Jelly'.
The Candidates Bit
Bastard features Rowe has only left m e
with about 239 words, so, less waffle!
Reform the college day I say! But do it
properly: Lectures start- at midnight so
y o u can go d o w n the bat first and get a
few beers and a swift curry in. O r y o u
can go to a gig or a film a n d go into
your lecture feeling good - after all, w h o
feels positive a n d ready to learn at 9.30
am. Also, you can get a tube i n w h e n it's
not busy, get o n e home i n the early
m o r n i n g w h e n it's not busy, and y o u
don't have to feel guilty about spending
the afternoon d o w n the p u b /watching
'Neighbours' etc, because you're not
missing any lectures. A n d a special
message to all y o u whizz-kid breadheads
in Finance i n Sherfield -
all the electricity we're gonna use is dead
cheap at that time i n the morning.
So, vote for m e and change the college
day into the college night - y o u k n o w it
makes sense (well, the Physics students i n
the flat above y o u are always running
around at four in the morning, aren't
they ?).
