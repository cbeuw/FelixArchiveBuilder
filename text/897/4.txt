Hon Sec (Events): Steve Farrant
Over the last year, the U n i o n has started
to head in a new direction. More
emphasis is placed on the areas that the
students want from the U n i o n . The
sabbaticals need to be up to the challenge
of providing these services and I believe I
a m the ideal candidate for H o n o r a r y
Secretary.
W i t h the Peachtree survey, many new
ideas will arise. This means more funding
will be needed and the u n i o n becomes
more business like. However, certain
traditional aspects of the union need be
stood by and the students shouldn't be
made to pay for the changes required.
As Honorary Secretary, I would try to
raise part of this money through external
r o o m bookings and facilities for outside
events (ie. the Proms over the summer).
Within college there are several areas
where the Honorary Secretary is
involved.
Ents events would be publicised at St.
Mary's, Silwood and South Kensington
and Mini-busses provided between sites.
Having been Rag C h a i r m a n , I k n o w how
R a g works a n d what needs to be done. A
shorter Rag W e e k with the best events
and a larger Rag Fete are to be
organised. M o r e external publicity would
be used to promote the w o r k a n d
improve the image of Rag and other
student activities.
S C A B would also be heavily publicised
in all of the college media, w i t h the
cooperation of the S C A B Chairman and
the Publicity Officer.
New events should be organised, Post-
Grad events, w o r k i n g w i t h the P G A O and
an Overseas W e e k (similar to Arts Week),
working with the OSC C h a i r m a n and
each O S C Club.
T o hear the rest (space is limited) come
and have a chat, in the U n i o n Office at
lunch times, the bar at most other times
or the Hustings U G M s .
Vote for Steve Farrant for ICU Honorary
Secretary (Events).
