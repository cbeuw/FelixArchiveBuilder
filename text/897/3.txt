President: Zoe Hellinger
Zoe's four years spent at I.C. have seen
her heavily involved in the Union from
day one. W i t h S C A B in the varied scenes
of Sound Director and Stage director of
Dramsoc, and as Administrator and
Technical Coordinator of Theatre West
E n d has overseen the success of "The
best student venue on the Fringe". A l l
this culminating in her becoming S C A B
Chairman this year where she has sat on
and contributed valuable discussion to
many of the Union's committees. Her
enthusiasm a n d aptitude to get o n w i t h
people, especially the U n i o n Permanent
staff, will be a great asset to her work as
Union President.
Zoe's personality, dedication and ability
to motivate people easily makes her the
best choice out of all the Presidential
Candidates to pull this Union together,
put students interests first, and make sure
this Union is r u n to the benefit of all.
Jeremy Burnell. (FELIX Business
Manager.)
The Union needs to be more accessible to
all students. W i t h this in m i n d , m y first
task will be to create a more inviting and
helpful atmosphere in the Union Office.
There are m a n y changes planned for the
college careers service w i t h no
consultation w i t h the student body. M y
top priority will be to get student
representation here and to ensure that no
changes involve a lowering of the service
standards.
St Mary's are an autonomous body and
in m y view they should stay that way.
Generally, m y experience
administrating Theatre West E n d will be a
great advantage in the administrative part
of the job. In w o r k i n g w i t h TWE's clients,
a w k w a r d members of the public and the
press, I k n o w I can negotiate well on
behalf of the students in order to give
them the best chance of gaining a
complete and rewarding education while
they're here.
Vote Zoe Hellinger.
President: Spenser Lane
Spenser has been a student at Imperial
for four years (UG+PG), a n d has been an
active member of ICU in previous years.
He has attended numerous committees
ranging from U F C to House. Currently, he
is S C C C h a i r m a n , its important
responsibilities including the
representation of nearly 2000 students,
that are members of social clubs, to ICU
Council and U G M . He is a fair and good-
humoured person with a positive attitude,
and will stick to the issue at hand. He has
always been firmly committed to
achieving the best deals for students.
The most important student issue in
recent history is about to hit us ie
deregulation (better k n o w n as voluntary
membership of y o u r student union). In
less than 5 years, the union's got to be
self-sufficient, and are we ready. No way!!
In addition, students have got no time to
get involved. They have got too m u c h to
do now without bothering to attend
lengthy meetings on trivial matters.
Therefore m y plans include:
1 - Keeping the bureaucracy to the
m i n i m u m (eg meetings kept short, sweet,
and to the point).
2 - A firm commitment to campaign for
more autonomy to the CCUs/MSCs. This
extra responsibility will allow them to run
their business with little needless
hinderance from the Union structure.
3 - M u c h m u c h better representation for
the overseas and postgraduate students.
These people are the most likely to leave
after deregulation.
4 - Seek better industrial sponsorship now
before the other student unions start
queuing for those limited resources.
Imperial has a reputation with industry
which College milks, so w h y don't we?
5 - Start organising plans to renovate the
union building (a pet hate is the state of
the union toilets. They need renovation
now!)

Deputy President: Jonathan Griffiths
T h e position of the Deputy President in
IC Union is not one of deputising for the
President, but one of fiscal responsibility
for all the Union's assets.
I don't believe anyone at IC can have
as m u c h professional experience as I
have to deal w i t h all the trading outlets,
as well as the needs of the C C U s and the
MSCs within college. Before coming to
Imperial, I was self-employed, owning a
coffee bar and two quality greengrocers,
over a period of five years. M y entry into
retailing was self-motivating and without
outside help. After five successful years I
decided I needed a change of direction,
so I embarked on a trail w h i c h led to
Imperial. Here, I have been involved with
the financial management of many
societies culminating in becoming SCC
Treasurer. This has seen me sit on U F C ,
as well as attending Council.
M y vision for the next year is to see all
the Union's trading outlets operating
profitably, a n d after studying their
accounts this seems perfectly feasible.
This surplus w o u l d then be ploughed
back into the Union to provide better
services, a better environment and the
best location for socialising. M y first
project w o u l d be to turn the Union
Dining Hall into a waitress- service
restaurant serving fayre to satisfy all
palates at affordable prices.
I believe that this refurbishment and
expansionist policy is the only way
forward. It's how m y shops survived a n d
grew during the Miner's Strike. W i t h the
possibility in the near future of all student
unions having to be self-financing, this is
surely the best way to m o v e forward.
For a student who would treat his
position as a profession, for a student
w h o wants to w o r k for you, for a student
with experience V O T E J.D.GRIFFITHS 1
