FOXES H O L E
Philosophically Speaking
Traditionally this is a term when every
one settles d o w n to s o m e w o r k a n d
everything stands a fair chance of falling
apart. Well, I haven't fallen apart yet, but
have you? Involvement is something that
all four of the college unions spend m u c h
verbiage expounding, but is it, in the
average student's interest if the the U n i o n
becomes a distraction rather than a n
attraction?
What I a m calling for is awareness.
Don't wander round like a 1980's version
of Tommy (for pinball substitute space
invaders). Y o u aren't blind, deaf or dumb,
though most IC students do give that
impression.
I can understand people being dissatisfied
w i t h I C U , I d o n ' t t h i n k it " w a l k s o n
water" either. W h a t I can't understand is
the way people c a n drift o n the tide
without so m u c h as a n attempt at altering
the course.
G a r y Nichols posed the " W h a t is a
H a c k ? " question. Well, it is difficult not to
become a hack when y o u spend more
than twelve hours most days up to your
pits in U n i o n b i z , but I do believe that
'hackdom' is more a state of mind than a
state of being. I must say that I have
deliberately avoided steeping myself in the
m y s t i q u e of S t a n d i n g O r d e r s a n d
P r o c e d u r a l M o t i o n s , b u t I c a n feel

A N Y O N E WANT A JOB?
Is there anyone w h o hasn't got a job
for next year yet who:
(1) likes working for long, irregular
hours.
(2) must live o n campus (in order
that people c a n c o m e to see y o u or
ring y o u up at any time of the night).
(3) enjoys working o n committees (33
at the latest count, a n d y o u c a n even
be chairman of six of them).
(4) is prepared for d r u n k e n idiots in
the bar threatening to push your face
in.
(5) d o e s n ' t m i n d h a v i n g p e o p l e

what you're doing about bar a n d
refectory prices, etc.
(6) people doing the same as (5)
behind your back (but ten times as
much).
(7) likes having dustbinfulls of m i x e d

Want to be a Deputy President?
so far I C U has only raised £800. That is
17p per student. Seventeen pence per
student? Please will y o u give s o m e . m o r e
money. Simply the price of a beer from
half the I C studes would raise £950.
There will be a preliminary meeting of a
group to organise further collections in
my office at 12:45 next Thursday.
DISAFFILIATION
A s v o u probably k n o w both Kings a n d
Reading have disthinged from the N U S ,
this means that I C U is no longer alone in
the outside. It will be very interesting to
see if any other universities follow suit

MEGALOMANIA (POST UGM)
I have always h a d tendencies towards
this unfortunate mental condition but now
I a m determined to let it get out of hand.
The inference at the U G M that I spend
my whole time writing letters to foreign
regimes is totally untrue.
Yes, I do write letters, as a n d when a
concerned union or sub-committee sees
fit, these letters, however, take a small
fraction of mine a n d the permanent staff's
time. Meetings, and general administration,
take up far more. O f course I care about
the services that the U n i o n a n d College
offer. It is ironic that I h a d proposed a
major change in the U n i o n sub-structure
to increase the U n i o n hand in this area
just minutes before this attack.
A n y w a y , must stop now. I'm playing
squash with President Tito tonight!
C h r i s
Y o u must be off your f g head. Stand
for H o n S e c , or President, or something
else silly like that.
Seriously, anyone taking o n a Sabbatical
Union office expecting it to be a doss would
get a v e r y n a s t y s u r p r i s e . G e t t i n g
involved in the U n i o n c a n be enjoyable,
but being full-time makes a big difference;
y o u ' r e e x p e c t e d t o w o r k t w e n t y - f o u r
hours a day, a n d wherever y o u go in
College people m o a n at you. Of course
there are some advantages; y o u c a n lead
a hectic social life (it would be difficult to
avoid this), which c a n be fun, a n d if y o u
want to go into a management career
when y o u leave the experience y o u gain
in t h e U n i o n m a y e n h a n c e y o u r j o b
prospects. Just remember that doing a
sabbatical is mainly work, worry, a n d
m o r e w o r k — y o u ' r e b a s i c a l l y c h e a p
labour.

standing for D P should come a n d see me
to learn more about what is involved
sometime soon.

Better paid too! I need someone to

WANTED: O N E CHAIRMAN,
UNION GENERAL MEETINGS
A t the U G M o n Thursday 13th M a r c h ,
elections will be held for various I C U n i o n
posts including U G M C h a i r m a n . Papers will
be going up o n Thursday the 28th of this
month.
1979-80 has been the first full academic
year of this job's existence, holders having
been M a l c o l m Brain (last academic year)
and myself.
In theory, all one has to do as C h a i r m a n is
to sit there a n d announce which item of
business c o m e s next, ask for speeches a n d
say whether the motion (etc) is passed or
defeated. F o r some reason, though, it never
really w o r k s out like that tind even the
essential familiarity with Standing O r d e r s
doesn't remove the need to 'live o n your
wits' when things get conflicted. There are
still many 'grey areas' in the Standing
Orders (eg length of speeches!) and m u c h is
left to the C h a i r m a n ' s discretion.
I h a v e f o u n d t h a t t h e m o r e y o u
understand about what's going o n , the
easier the job becomes — so 'reading up' o n
motions a n d amendments beforehand is
useful — especially when one is called to
make a decision o n 'a move to vote',
'question be not put' or 'take it in parts'
procedural motion.
Although motions must be submitted to
the H o n Sec seven days beforehand to be
guaranteed a place o n the A g e n d a , the
C h a i r m a n m a y s u b s e q u e n t l y a c c e p t
motions a n d amendments at his discretion.
S o here's the bottom line — no one has
yet approached me about standing — if y o u
do plan to stand for U G M C h a i r m a n , I might
be able to pass o n some useful hints.
M i c k B e r r y
FIRE EXTINGUISHERS
It's been pointed out to me that a lot of
s t u d e n t s p r o b a b l y live i n a flat w i t h
others, all having various valuable items in
rooms with no fire insurance, w h o might
l i k e t o c l u b t o g e t h e r t o b u y a fire
extinguisher. I c a n get some at a discount
price — anyone wanting to place a n order
can see me in the U n i o n Office.
MULTIGYM
The multigym should arrive sometime
in M a r c h a n d will be kept in the Sports
Centre. It will be available for anyone to
use for weight-training or just general
keep-fit exercises.
Entry to the Sports Centre is 15p but is
free f o r m e m b e r s of W e i g h t s C l u b
(membership El.OOpa).
VANDALISM/THEFT
S o m e o n e has broken the lock o n one
of t h e D u r e x m a c h i n e s in the g e n t s '
toilets in the Union. I take a d i m enough
v i e w of p e o p l e a c c i d e n t a l l y s m a s h i n g
things whilst they are pissed out of their
heads; I like thieves even less. A n y o n e
caught will be handed over to the police
(eventually), banned from the U n i o n for
life a n d publicly ostracised in F E L I X , their
department informed, a n d anything else I
can think of at the time.
Y o u have been warned!
