MOTORCYCLE CLUB
Last term was o n e of the most
successful periods in the club's short
history since it was formed four years
ago.
In October the Club received an
invitation to take part in a competition
organised by the Barking Road Safety
Officer to find the 'Safe Rider Of The
Year 1979'. The event attracted riders
from all over London and consisted of
a number of low speed tests, designed
to test the riders' balance and control
of their bikes, followed by a Highway
C o d e test. There was great surprise
a m o n g s t the C l u b m e m b e r s when
C h r i s R e e s , t h e C l u b ' s C a p t a i n ,
someone not noted for his safe riding,
was declared the winner. Dave Edgley,
Club treasurer managed a runner-up
slot, on his "amazing" Honda CX500
(known as a plastic maggot due to its
s h a p e a n d material c o n s t r u c t i o n ) .

bollards and he rode into an adjacent
brick wall.
The next competitive event of the term
came when four of the Club members
were invited to attend the Star Pupil Day
run by the Motorcycle School at Brands
Hatch. These members being Bill Nash,
Steve Warin, Chris Rees and Julian
Harris. This annual competition is run
for the best thirty-five pupils from
approximately 2,500 who attend the
school in any one year, and requires
entrants to complete ten laps on the
school's bikes whilst being judged on.
lines, braking, gear changing, smooth-
ness, etc. Track conditions on the day
were far from ideal, having rained in
the m o r n i n g the f r a c t i o n was at
minimum. Steve and Bill were the first
of our members to ride and came back
complaining of terrible front and back
wheel slides (not recommended on
two wheels). Julian and Chris were in
the last group out and produced some
r e a s o n a b l e lap t i m e s with J u l i a n
eventually putting in a one minute six
seconds (very quick in the wet and
fastest of the day). After processing
the results it was a n n o u n c e d that
Julian had finished second, winning
fifty pounds and a silver trophy while
C h r i s was fifth c o l l e c t i n g t w e n t y

A number of members compete in
motorcycle road racing at Club level

incredibly ancient Velocette (against
Pukka racing Yamahas? what a man)
and a few others are starting this year.
The Club now has strong links with
the m o t o r c y c l e r a c i n g s c h o o l at
Brands Hatch and will be helping to
run in the s c h o o l s new b a t c h of
Honda 400 twins. We also anticipate
another trip to the school later this
term for tuition, so that all budding
Barry sheenes can play at being boy
racers.
The Club meets every Wednesday at
1:00pm a b o v e S t a n ' s , a n d a l w a y s
welcomes new members, possession
of a motorcycle is not necessary.

SAILING CLUB
IC vs Cambridge University
Having beaten Oxford on their home
water last w e e k , IC s a i l i n g t e a m
travelled to Cambridge on Sunday to
take on that university's team.
Conditions were light and variable,
mainly due to the lake (a duck pond,
actually, I think) being surrounded by
trees, but IC took commanding first,
second and sixth positions at the start
of the first race. H o w e v e r , having
taken two lots of penalty points, the
team needed to improve on the sixth
race, and so by the finish the positions
were first, second and third. Unfortu-
nately, C o l i n M u r r a y c o l l i d e d with
team-mate Ian Robson on the finish
line, resulting in more penalty points,
but the positions were good enough
for IC to win the race.
In the second race, IC were again
first, second, and sixth by the first
mark, with team captain J o h n Williams
holding a good lead. Nick Ajderian,
taking a turn on the helm, and lying
second, was put under some pressure
by the Cambridge boats, but held out
so that IC finished first, second, and
sixth, winning the race and the match.
With home matches against Oxford
and Cambridge to come, IC's position
in the league looks very strong.
T e a m : J o h n Williams (capt), Gill
Butler, Ian Robson, Kevin Andrews,
Colin Murray and Nick Ajderian.

AND SNOOKER CLUB REPORT
O n Wednesday occurred the biggest
event since the hour before. T h e ' A ' team
played the ' C team or visa versa. In one
of the most dramatically unmemorable
sequences in Transylvanian history, the
'C team were annihilated like a B e n n -
Callaghan interaction with the ' A ' team
playing with the a u t h o r i t y of a P e t e r
Purves darts commentary, the ' C team,
even though high on 'scar' music were
defenseless (cor, Madness!). This first

reminiscent of a pregnant jabberwocky

between G Curtis and C r a s s Tripp, which
was billed as a flyweight contest with one
ball or a submission deciding the winner. I
did hear cries of "I submit" from Curtis
but I think it was the ball which w o n it for
M r Tripp, giving the ' A ' team a five-nil
win.
T h e ' B ' team played L S E at home later in
the day. T h e ' B ' team's reservists were led
by M r A Leclezio. S e c o n d o n was Steve

not even a J o h n Travolta movie could
stop C C from losing (although Urban

Last o n was Phil Peters, a true Irish
immigrant smuggled inside a ten p o u n d
bomb in 1975. H i s explosive action, «with
as m u c h style as a B o b Geldoff haircut or
a Jess Yates sermon, w o n him the day to
give the ' B ' team a four-one win.
