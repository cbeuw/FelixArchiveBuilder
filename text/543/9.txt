The Beau Brummie
STAR WRECK
This is the story of the Imperial
College C a n o e Club on its weekend
m i s s i o n to e x p l o r e the u n c h a r t e d
b e n d s of the River Dart, to shoot
treacherous swirling rapids, to boldly
paddle where no canoeist has paddled
before.
C a p t a i n ' s l o g : S t a r d a t e 2 5 / 1 / 8 0
5:00pm — C l u b assembled outside
Union Arch. After problems in obtaining
one of our two vans, we've phoned
'Dial-a-wreck' who've sent us their Sfar
Wreck.
12:00pm: Star Wreck can go no further
— f o r t y m i l e s o u t s i d e E x e t e r —
marooned.
3:00am: Having cleared the anti-matter
pods and decoked the warp-drive, we
eventually arrive at destination.
11:30am: River is low. Thirteen brave
c a n o e i s t s e m b a r k on the perilous
rock-dodging descent, negotiating the
likes of 'Lovers Leap' and 'Triple drop'
without too many casualities.
2:00pm: All arrive safely, though one
canoe leaking too badly to use again.
2:45pm: Half a dozen of the more
intrepid attempt another run.
4:00pm: Two more canoes now 'holed'.
Several more canoeists have taken an
early bath after c a p s i z i n g . Return
home to base at Dartmoor Expedition
Centre for hot meal.
7:00pm: Off to quiet local in Widecomb
for evening.
1 1 : 3 0 p m : H a v e to d i s c i p l i n e two
members of the crew, side tracked from
duty by a highly suspicious invitation to
a pyjama party.
9:00am: Time for two more runs before
we have to warp back to London,
succeed in holing another nine boats on
rocks. Only two boats still O K . Now we
have thirteen 'star wrecks'.
3:30pm: Set off to London.
6:00pm: Break journey at Wylyle to
'refuel' crew.
11:30pm: Home. Never again . . . Beam
me up, Doris.
If you're interested in joining the
crew, why not be 'enterprising' and
come down to the swimming pool on
Tuesday nights at 6:30pm. See you
there . . .
