thought to interpret the results.

Student Meeting to discuss
the Finniston Report
6:30pm, Monday 11th
February in the Senior
Common Room, Union
Building.
I C C A G
I'm sure there are still a lot of you — in fact
most of you — who have had nothing to do
with us and so that makes it useful to put yet
another (I'm getting quite good at being a
publicity officer) report.
Right: O n the 29th F e b r u a r y we'll be
e n t e r t a i n i n g s o m e d e p r i v e d k i d s f r o m
Birkenhead and so you're very welcome to
come along and offer your services (Catholic
or Anglican or specialised butty-making) to us
if you want a day doing something besides
lectures. After all it's only once in four yr s,
so I C C A G can make that day doubly spt lal
for you.
A n d there are the soup runs. As less and
less people take notice of me more and more
room becomes available on Tuesdays and
Fridays to jump in a minibus to visit some of
London's West End high spots like the flower
beds in Lincoln's Inn Fields and under the
bridge to C h a r i n g C r o s s station at the
Embankment. If you don't think that's your
scene, you already have something in common
with the people we visit because to tell the
truth, I'm sure they don't like it much either.
That's at 10:30pm in Falmouth kitchens and it
makes their life a little more bearable.
A n d if you've any other bright ideas we
are always available on the third floor of the
Union Building on Monday dinnertimes to pack
you off to hospital visits or visiting thousands
of long stay patients in beautiful Surrey.
See ya
