By-Law Changes
1. I C W A (proposed by J o Armitage)
It took thirty minutes of discussion and
s p e e c h e s to e v e n t u a l l y pass the first
reading of the proposed change, which, if
passed at the second reading, will delete
the I C W A constitution from the Blue
J3ook, change the I C W A Lounge into the
U p p e r Lounge and remove the "President
of t h e W o m e n ' s A s s o c i a t i o n " f r o m
C o u n c i l .
J o h n Whitehouse moved a procedural
motion that the question be moved to a
later meeting, when the results of the
I C W A questionnaire had been published,
b u t t h i s w a s t u r n e d d o w n b y t h e
C h a i r m a n .
The amendment, proposed by M a l c o l m
Brain, to remove the right of I C W A to
have a specific r o o m (the I C W A Lounge)
but delete the rest of the by-law change
was narrowly defeated by 106 to 96.
2. E s t a b l i s h m e n t O f I n t e r n a l S e r v i c e
C o m m i t t e e (proposed by C h r i s Fox)
T h e first reading was passed without
opposition, so that the Service Committee
and the Haldane Library Committee may be
r e p l a c e d b y t h e I n t e r n a l S e r v i c e s
Committee. T h e Deputy President would
become the chairman of this committee.
3. T o Put A c a d e m i c Standing Clause Into
By-laws (proposed by R J Stotesbury)
T h e second reading was passed without
o p p o s i t i o n . T h i s will n o w s p e c i f i c a l l y
prevent a repetition of the J o h n Shuttle-
worth case.
Motions
1. Finniston Report (proposed by Rick
Waldenberg, seconded by M a r k Brown)
This motion noted the recommendations
of the c o m m i t t e e of i n q u i r y i n t o the
engineering profession which are that:
a. Engineering courses should become
m o r e b i a s e d t o w a r d s f u t u r e s i n
management.
b. The status of engineers should be
increased.
c. T h e e n g i n e e r i n g s t u d e n t s h o u l d
receive an extra £250 in recognition of
their importance in industry.
It advised that, since Imperial College
students would be greatly effected by this
report, students should read a synopsis (the
actual report is over 200 pages long) and
play a role in the development of a response
to the report.
Bernard Smith's proposed amendment to
the motion, which would add to I C U
Believes that "Engineering students should
not be considered in isolation from the rest
of the student body" and " T h a t non-
engineering students are as important to
Industry as engineering students," was
u n f o r t u n a t e l y m i s i n t e r p r e t e d ; b o t h by
Bernie and those present at the U G M . The
d e b a t e o n B e r n i e ' s a m e n d m e n t t h u s
became more of a question as to whether
engineers should receive an extra £250, and
almost developed into a Guilds vs T h e Rest
debate.
The procedural motion that the question
be not heard was passed by a majority vote
and thus the amendment was defeated.
W h e n Bernie tried to oppose the main
motion with exactly the same speech he
used for the amendment the procedural
motion that the speaker be not heard was
moved, and again passed by a majority
vote.
T h e m o t i o n w a s e v e n t u a l l y p a s s e d ,
though voting appeared to be close.
Chris F o x also announced that Sir M o n t y
Finniston will be visiting the College on
M o n d a y 3rd M a r c h , and hence members of
Guilds and Mines have had all lectures after
3:30pm cancelled for that day.
A procedural motion to adjourn the
meeting so that the A n t i - C o r r i e Bill lobby
march could be joined by members of the
meeting was not accepted.
2. Megalomania (proposed by P M e r r y m a n ,
seconded by S Teelock)
This was, according to M r M e r r y m a n ,
obviously a joke motion, and in his speech
he put forward that the letters written to the
Soviet Embassy and M r s Thatcher would
have no effect on their policies and, as such,
the motions passed recently on those
subjects, and the motions on S o u t h Africa
and C a m b o d i a were futile and a waste of
U n i o n time.
T h e amendment which proposed to
delete I C U instructs, was defeated and
the main motion was passed, in spite of
C h r i s F o x ' s s t a t e m e n t that the E x e c
knew that their letters had little effect, but
that every bit of opposition, however
small, helps.
This will mean that the E A O will now
have to apply to the U N , on behalf of
I C U for a seat on the U N C .
The meeting was adjourned at 2:20pm.

LORD A N N A N AT THE
BOARD OF STUDIES
MEETING
" S o this is the Right Honourable L o r d
A n n a n , t h e V i c e C h a n c e l l o r of the
University of L o n d o n , " I thought as he
spoke to the B o a r d of Studies meeting
last Wednesday. This is the top bod in
L o n d o n U n i v e r s i t y , o n e of the m o s t
important people in higher education in
this country. O n e expects to be impressed
by p e o p l e of this s t a t u r e . I was not
impressed at all. F a r from it, the man doesn't
k n o w what he's talking about; and that's
not my opinion, that's fact.
" T h e students' union of this college,
like all other colleges, is financed directly
by local education authorities," he said.
W r o n g . W e are one of few student's
unions in the country which receives its
grant as a subvention from the college
and hence our funds come from the block
g r a n t g i v e n by the U n i v e r s i t y G r a n t s
C o m m i s s i o n to I C .
O f the areas where economies could be
made in order to cope with the G o v e r n -
ment cuts, one of his principle suggestions
was that students should play sports on
S u n d a y s as w e l l as S a t u r d a y s a n d
Wednesdays so that the number of sports
grounds could be reduced. I'm sure that
will go an enormous way towards saving
the many millions of pounds that need to
be saved. M i n d you, Senate H o u s e are
doing their bit: a couple of staff have left
and they haven't been replaced he told us
emphatically.
H o w about closing one of the smaller
L o n d o n c o l l e g e s , s o m e b o d y a s k e d .
(Which, realistically, is one of the few
ways that really substantial savings could
be m a d e , e v e n t h o u g h it m a y be
undesirable.) H e didn't sound too keen: it
may be considered by a committee he's
setting up to look into it.
E x a m costs are coming under attack
alot t h e s e d a y s , a n d q u i t e r i g h t l y as
a d m i n s t r a t i o n of e x a m c o s t s L o n d o n
University nearly two million pounds a
y e a r . L o r d A n n a n believes in e x a m s
though, he told us: " A three hour exam is
a good test of character . . . puts the
student under pressure; after all, we're all
under pressure." I must admit I found it
difficult not to laugh in the face of this
British Colonial A r m y Stiff U p p e r L i p
stuff.
W h a t about the University trying to
raise some money? Well, he's definitely
doing his bit to help there. O h yes, he's
inviting some top industrialists to the
anniversary dinner of the Q u e e t L M u m
being chancellor. A n d by 'rationalisation'
does he mean cuts? shrinkage? . . . well,
we didn't actually get an answer on that
one.
I'll say one thing for L o r d A n n a n , he
d o e s fully a p p r e c i a t e the folly of the
present government's attitude towards
higher education. H e , like anybody else
who has given the matter any thought,
realises that the government calculations
of ' f u l l e c o n o m i c c o s t ' for o v e r s e a s
students aren't based on c o m m o n sense.
S o that was the L o r d A n n a n we've all
heard about. A s I say, I'm not impressed.
