FELIX
THE JOB
(PART 1)
Last year's elections for F E L I X
Editor were fought on rather muddy
ground. This year I hope that all the
.Sabbatical elections will be con-
ducted ir^the right spirit.
If y o u are interested in standing for
the post then please come in for a
chat as soon as possible.
This week I've featured photos of
the computer typesetter. T h e top pic
shows the keyboard which is a
terminal with extra keys for entering
column widths and type styles and
sizes. A full-time operator, M a z ,
types most of the F E L I X copy but it is
important that a F E L I X candidate
knows how to operate the typesetter
( e s p e c i a l l y for p r o d u c i n g h i s / h e r
election publicity).
T h e middle photo shows the P C B
boards and the bottom pic features
the lens mechanism.
T h e typesetter stores one line at a '
time a n d outputs photographic paper
i n t o a c a s s e t t e w h i c h is t h e n
transferred to an automatic devel-
oper . . . more next week.

Section of a
typesetting disc.
laser engraved
The typesetting disc rotates to
the position of the required letter.
T h e location is optically deter-
mined by analysing the codes on
the extremities of the disc.
A complicated lens arrange-
ment focuses the image of the
letters on to photographic paper.
T h e letter size can be varied from
five to thirty-six point. (This text is
typeset in nine point.)
The style of type font can be
changed by entering codes from
the keyboard or by changing the
disc.
