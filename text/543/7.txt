T h i s is the original D e L a R u e
C o m p a n y , designing and printing
banknotes, bonds, cheques,
passports, travellers' cheques and
other special items for m a n y
nations.
T h e D i v i s i o n needs A r t s or
Science graduates to work as
production trainees. Oliver G r a y ,
who joined last year with a degree
in G e r m a n and Politics and is
n o w a Banknote Controller, puts
it like this:
"The world of banknotes is
certainly not routine and each
day produces its own unique
problems to challenge one's
capabilities. I am directly involved
with the main product and this
makes each day excitingly varied".
DeLaRue Systems
D e L a R u e Systems' m a i n
products are machines to count,
sort and dispense banknotes and
other documents. Electronic and
M e c h a n i c a l Engineering
graduates are needed to j o i n
project development teams.
Languages and Engineering
graduates are also needed to train
for Sales and P r o d u c t i o n .
K e i t h W e m y s s . who joined as an
Electronics graduate says:
"The job is always interesting
and varied with very little
repetitive work and there are
plenty of challenges".
Crosfield Electronics
T h i s Division's product range
includes M A G N A S C A N
Electronic Scanners for c o l o u r
separation and e n l a r g e m e n t s
wide range o f press controls and
laser gravure for engraving
printing cylinders. T h e D i v i s i o n
needs Electronic, M e c h a n i c a l
and P r o d u c t i o n Engineers. A l s o ,
graduates with any numerate
discipline are needed to train as
programmers for software
development. Peter R u s h , a
graduate in Electrical E n g i n e e r i n g
describes his first impressions o f
the firm:
"There was lots of interfacing
between electronic engineering,
optics, electro-optics, and
mechanical engineering. Physicists
worked alongside engineers.
Laser techniques were used
electronically as well as for
cutting. There was much advanced
engineering going on and I wanted
to be a part of it".
Security Express
T h i s D i v i s i o n is a highly success-
ful security transport business
concerned with cash-in-transit
and also a next-day delivery
service, provides for non-security
goods throughout the U K . T h e r e
is a lively, interesting w o r k climate
for A r t s or Science graduates.
Derek M o o r e , a recent graduate
sums it up like this:
"Everybody works hard here
but there is none of the gnawing
pressure you usually associate
with big business. It helps a lot to
see yourself in a senior position
and you can quickly get involved
in higher levels of decision
making".
