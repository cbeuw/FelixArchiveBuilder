D e a r C o l i n
A t the time of writing I do
not know the result of your
motion on the O l y m p i c Games,
but I would like to make some
c o m m e n t s . Y o u r m o t i o n is
erroneous in many aspects:
1. Athletes from all countries
have not been training for the
1980 O l y m p i c s , as there will be
no South African or Rhodesian
athletes present.
2. If I C U believes that sport
s h o u l d n e v e r be u s e d as a
weapon or for political pur-
poses. T h i s is a sentiment that I
agree with, then do you and
I C U approve of the Gleneagles
Agreement? Is it not hypocritical
to p r o p o s e a n d s u p p o r t this
motion if you do support the
G l e n e a g l e s A g r e e m e n t w h i c h
calls for a boycott on sport with
South Africa?
3. T o me the ideals of the
O l y m p i c Games are dead. T h i s
is because they are no longer
apolitical and have not been so
for a long time. T h e y are used
as a political weapon. D o you
remember the M o n t r e a l O l y m p i c
Games and N e w Zealand? T h e y
are no longer amateur events as
far as R u s s i a n a t h l e t e s are
concerned although they are not
quite professional.
4. It is hypocritical to condemn
a call to boycott while calling
for a b o y c o t t of sport w i t h
a n o t h e r c o u n t r y for p o l i t i c a l
reasons.
Yours sincerely
Lawrence Stucke.
Dear Sir
It appears that only about
five percent of the questionnaire
sheets were returned. I would
suggest to you that the thing is
useless. I think most students
here have at least a superficial
u n d e r s t a n d i n g o f r a n d o m
s a m p l i n g i n s t a t i s t i c s . T h e
questionnaire has only produced
data from students who are
interested in returning it (5%). In
no way can this be a truly
random sample of IC students. I
expect someone from the maths
department might assist you in
running a more sensible ques-
tionnaire.

Dear Sir
I was dismayed to see the
first r e a d i n g of the m o t i o n
proposing the total abolition of
the Imperial College Women's
Association passed by such a
large majority and with such
little d i s c u s s i o n at the last
Union meeting. The proponents
of the motion produced very
v e r b o s e a n d s a r d o n i c a r g u -
ments. They also levelled, I feel,
some unjustified criticisms at the
a s s o c i a t i o n . M a n y i m p o r t a n t
issues in the debate seem to have
become clouded, or overlooked
completely, and although the
problem is not an easy one it
appears to comprise of three
b a s i c a r e a s of d i s c o n t e n t .
Namely the existence of the
I C W A Lounge, the finance that
I C W A receives from the union
and the representation that it has
on various U n i o n committees
and on council.
The objection to the presence
of the I C W A Lounge seems to
me to be singularly ludicrous as it
serves many other functions
o t h e r t h a n t h a t of b e i n g a
women's lounge. N o t least of
these functions is its use as a
crash pad at the beginning of the
year. The r o o m is also used for
meetings, rehearsals and many
other purposes. I see no reason
why any group with a reasonable
claim cannot use it at any time
they require it. However, for
those parts of the day when it is
not being used why is it wrong to
dedicate it to use by women? I
cannot ever recall having heard
of a case of w o m e n barricading
themselves in the I C W A Lounge
and refusing to allow anyone else
to use it. W h e n one considers
that almost every other area in
College is populated primarily by
men, simply by virtue of the high
percentage of men studying at
IC, is it unreasonable to allocate
a small area as a place where
women can go and feel fairly
confident of finding less men
than women?
The financial aspect of the
p r o b l e m a l s o s e e m s t o be
s o m e t h i n g of a r e d h e r r i n g
dangled around to mislead us all.
I C W A , like any other group in
the U n i o n , receives its finance
from U F C . If the U n i o n believes
t h a t it r e c e i v e s m o n e y i n
d i s p r o p o r t i o n to its r e q u i r e -
ments then it is up to U F C to
make the necessary reduction in
its grant. T o state that I C W A
squanders too m u c h money, and
consequently should be abol-
ished to prevent this, is like tryng
to crack a nut with a steam roller.
A l l o c a t i n g U n i o n m o n e y t o
minority groups is not some form
of grave sin as all U n i o n grants, in
effect, go to minority interests. I
would challenge anyone to show
me just one piece of Union
expenditure that has benefitted
every member of the Union. A s
an aside, I personally would
rather see X pounds spent on
I C W A than X pounds spent by
C C U V P s on drinks in the bar for
rag collectors.
Arguably, representation is
the most important function of
I C W A . R e p r e s e n t a t i o n of
women both within the Union
and to the College authorities.
The I C W A President is not alone
on C o u n c i l in having the specific
task of voicing the views of a
particular portion of the U n i o n
membership. The O S C Chair-
man, P G Affairs Officer and
Silwood Park Representative all
have identical functions. The
I C C A G C h a i r m a n even sits on
Council to inform us of the action
of IC in the "community at
large". I would find it strange if,
s a y , t h e I C C A G C h a i r m a n
remained on C o u n c i l to repre-
s e n t t h e i n t e r e s t s of t h e
community whilst the I C W A
President, who represents the
views of women in College, was
r e m o v e d . M a n y p e o p l e a r e
perfectly capable of representing
themselves. They have voices
loud enough to be heard. M a n y
more voices that are not heard
a n d n e e d r e p r e s e n t a t i o n by
some person or body more able.
They should be deprived of this
right. Further, to state the I C W A
President is unrepresentative
and out of contact with the
membership and that the I C W A
Committee practises some false
form of democracy is fallacious.
It is no more or less democratic
than most other Union comit-
tees. If we are going to level the
finger at areas of the union
structure that are undemocratic
and not as representative as they
might be I can think of many
places to point it before I C W A .
T o support the motion for the
abolition of I C W A is to selfishly
steal away the I C W A Lounge for
some dubious future purpose,
which nobody seems to have
thought m u c h about. It is to put a
stop to all the social events that
I C W A organises and prevent
w o m e n h a v i n g a c o r p o r a t e
representative position in the
Union and in College. T o abolish
I C W A is to sweep away an
e s t a b l i s h e d , t r a d i t i o n a l a n d
dignified organisation. It is an
insult to the w o m e n studying at
IC and to those w o m e n destined
to c o m e here in the future to
I h o p e t h a t t h i s w i l l n o t
happen.

Dear Colin
Time has come to defend
s t u d e n t g r a n t s ! A t the last
U G M there was great confusion
about the motion on student
grants. The motion called for
national discussion on the level
of grants n o t c a l l i n g for a n
i n c r e a s e . A t present we are
opposing cuts in the increases of
educational expenditure, we are
not yet fighting cuts in educa-
tional expenditure. T o freeze
grant levels will effectively de-
value student grants by 20% (a
rough estimate for inflation over
the next year). J o has obviously
n e v e r l i v e d i n n o n - C o l l e g e
r e s i d e n c e , as o t h e r w i s e she
would understand that many
students cannot live on their
grants. It should be remembered
that m a n y s t u d e n t s d o not
receive sponsorship and that
many students live in private
a c c o m m o d a t i o n v i z , f l a t s ,
bedsits and lodgings.
Whilst in an ideal society we
would campaign for the total
abolition of the means test, it
should be noted that we can
h o p e to w i n this c a m p a i g n
immediately but that the means
t e s t m u s t b e p h a s e d o u t
gradually. Unitl that is accom-
plished we must continue to fight
for increases in student grants so
that the grant will not become
d e v a l u e d a n d e c o n o m i c a l l y
meaningless. The student grant
should allow students to study at
university and we should actively
campaign to ensure this.
Y o u r s sincerely

Dear Sir
Surely anyone would agree
t h a t it is i r r e s p o n s i b l e t o
deliberately refuse to see the
facts before making important
decisions, but that is exactly
what happened at last Tuesday's
U G M w h e n m y p r o c e d u r a l
motion to postpone the I C W A
debate was defeated.
What I was trying to say was
that to make such a decision
on whether or not I C W A was
irrelevant, we should first see
t h e r e s u l t s of t h e r e c e n t
questionnaire rather than rely
purely on the partisan presen-
tation of the speakers. This
opinion I feel was borne out
when speakers from both sides
used the so far unpublished
results of the questionnaire to
support their side.
I realise everyone's minds
had been made up before the
meeting, but one has to at least
pay lip service to democracy.
