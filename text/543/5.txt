T H E QUESTION (-NAIRE)
The final results are not, obviously, ready
yet since with five sections and, at the final
count, 272 acceptably filled questionnaires, it
has taken over nine hours just to do the types
of College entertainment that people like to
experience (including five who ticked 'other'),
the best and worst films and part of the FELIX
rock and pop awards.
Best Film: Life of Brian (57 votes)
Worst Film: Didn't See It (22 votes)
followed by Star Trek (14 votes)
Fanatasia managed to get one vote from a
coke drinking, male, Physics 2 undergraduate.
For the worst film there were nominations for
Cannable, S T O I C and Emmanuelle.
Sixty of the questionnaires came from
women and a few from those who were not
quite sure of their sex, and more than a few
wrote "yes".
College Entertainment
The form most experienced by those who
replied to this section was the College bars
(182), but films followed closely (168). Other
results were discos (109), live concerts (117)
and Space Invaders (98). The figures in the
brackets being the number who ticked that
type. Union clubs and societies were the most
quoted form of other entertainment; women
then voting for parties (6), C C U events (6) and
men for IC Radio (6) and pool (6).
F E L I X R O C K A N D P O P A W A R D S
Only three sections have been checked as
yet, but the following results are known:
Best Male Singer: Cliff Richard
Best Female Singer: Kate Bush
Best Single O f The Past Year: Another
Brick In The Wall pt 2
The best single result was very close with
Message In A Bottle and / Don't Like Mondays
receiving just one less vote than Pink Floyd's
single.
Mary and Malcolm checking questionnaires.
Eric Jarvis received nine nominations for
Best Male Singer, Katy Thatchell five votes for
Best Female Singer and Colin Palmer five
votes for Male and two for Best Female Singer.
A s early results came in he was wondering
whether to record a song for IC Radio Eight
Days A Week.
We received a lot of helpful suggestions for
improving FELIX, hence the new puzzles page.
Any contributions of puzzles for the next issue
will be most welcome. Those people who
requested more letters will be satisfied if they
can get more people to write letters (or even
controversial articles).
A s for popularity, News was a clear winner
with 132 firsts out of 223 votes, the next was
Letters with 35 firsts out of 216 and 70
seconds. Again more news means more news
collectors (and writers). If you are dissatisfied
with the amount of news then keep your ears
open, for small items and large. All con-
tributions will be gratefully received by the
News E d (ie me!).
More results next week but many thanks to
Lars, Paul J Upton, Leslie Horrocks and Dave.

PS: LATE RESULT
Best A l l Time Singles: Bohemian Rhapsody
and Nights In White Satin.
Adam wins the joke vote.

T H E PIMLICO C O N N E C T I O N
1980—1981
Every Wednesday afternoon from
October to January, Imperial College
students visit three inner London
comprehensive schools (Pimlico,
Holland Park and Stock well Manor),
to help with the teaching of Science
and Engineering.
The Pimlico Connection is now an
official I C U society, and we are trying
to recruit tutors to ensure the
scheme's academic success in the next
academic year. It is essential that the
schools know well in advance both
how many tutors they can expect
and what they want to tutor.
What did. you do on Wednesday
afternoons last term? Can't remember?
Why not do something you'll find
worthwhile . . . Become a Link in the
Pimlico Connection!
If you're at all interested, please
contact the following for further
details: Clive Chandler, Civ Eng 2;
Alan Rogers, Elec Eng 2 or Dr J S R
G o o d l a d , R o o m 603, Elec E n g .
R e m e m b e r , we need people to
volunteer NOW to tutor next year. If
you can't find us, drop a note
through the internal mail and we'll
find you!
ALBERT A N D T H E
BIORHYTHMS
"What's a biorhythm?" asked Albert.
Cedric frowned, his brow corrugating like
mildewed graph paper. H e reached for his
Collins English Dictionary:
"Biorhythm . . . Biorhythm . . . A h , yes, got
it, here it is; it's something you can deduce
from FELIX questionnaires — you take a
whole load of them, add something up, divide it
and then you can tell how critical you are."
"Sounds like maths to me," said Albert, a
note of apprehension in his voice.
" U m m . . . no, can't be — it says the
c o m p u t a t i o n s c a n be p e r f o r m e d by a n y
member of the FELIX staff. Apparently . . . "
Cedric's voice faltered like a major claim.
" G o o d Lord, what's wrong?" asked Albert, a
n e w , a l t o g e t h e r m o r e v i b r a n t n o t e of
apprehension in his voice.
"I feel awful; I think I'm going into a n
intellectual critical with a sensitivity plus,"
whispered Cedric, his face paler than the
underbelly of a Union Hack.
"I don't think I know what that means," said
Albert.
"Neither do J , " said Cedric, his supine form
at odds with the permanent wave of the
Axminster.
Albert reached for the dictionary . . .
B I O R H Y T H M : See FELIX Questionnaire.
FELIX Q U E S T I O N N A I R E : a cunning device
which, in the hands of certain unscrupulous
people, can prove a positive menace. In
particular, closer examination of the 'Food and
Drink while at College' section may reveal
hitherto unsuspected facets of a person's
biorhythm. (see B I O R H Y T H M ) (see also
I N D U C E D B I O R H Y T H M ) .
I N D U C E D B I O R H Y T H M : it has been noted
recently that students are peculiarly vulnerable
to biorhythmic induction. The yearly cycle of
lectures a n d s o c i a l f u n c t i o n s with their
overtones of boredom and debauchery channel
the energies of the average student into
troughs and crests, rather like your well-known
wave-motion in Physics.
" A n d this is a dictionary?" Albert mused . .
Cycles of intellectual criticals (low level) and
pluses (high level) occur in conjunction with
examinations, full moons and opening time.
Ditto with the physical and the sensitivity side.
. . . there was a crash of breaking glass as
Albert hurled Cedric through the window and
climbed out onto the fire escape. Taking as
many as one step at a time, he rushed to the
bottom and ran, with all the speed of a bye-law
change, to the FELIX Office. Frenzied flicking
t h r o u g h t h e m o u n d o f q u e s t i o n n a i r e s
confirmed his worst fears:
"I still don't bleeding understand . . . "
