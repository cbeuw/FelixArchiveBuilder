MOONEY WINS RADIO
NEWS QUIZ
T h e ' N E W S Q U I Z ' p a n e l g a m e
programme that the B B C recorded in the
U n i o n C o n c e r t Hall o n Thursday was
broadcast early Saturday afternoon. D u r i n g
the programme the College was mentioned
several times; but the most interesting point
was w h e n the w o r d ' M o o n e y ' appeared in
one of the questions, w h i c h elicited a large
cheer from the audience. However, when
Barry T o o k , the questionmaster, asked the
audience what the significance of the w o r d
' M o o n e y ' was, C h r i s F o x , I C U president,
shouted out, " D o n ' t tell h i m " .
T h e programme was repeated on
M o n d a y and the B B C will be returning to
Imperial later this term to record another
edition of the quiz. ' M o o n e y ' won last
weeks quiz and the producer is hoping to
write him into the script of the next
programme to be recorded at I C .
Not a great deal has occurred within
the confines of the R S M since my last

events in the near future.

its members.

Well January's events have
c o m e and gone a n d what a
m o n t h of indifference. W i t h the
election machinery trundelling
towards the Hustings U G M on
T h u r s d a y 28th February it's
time to decide whether or not
y o u are prepared to inject your
e n t h u s i a s m i n t o t h e R o y a l
C o l l e g e of S c i e n c e U n i o n .
Remember each post is what
y o u make it so if y o u think we
got it all wrong this year, stand
up and try to sort it out for
1980-81.
Tuesday's Night O u t to the
theatre on student stand-bys
was a moderately rip-roaring
success. Without burning holes
in anyone's pockets we could
have had forty stand-by seats
for either Middle Age Spread
or The Last Of The Red Hot
Lovers. However, a quick show
of hands in the C o c k n e y Pride
revealed that there were only
s e v e n t e e n of u s , a n d m o s t
wanted to see Richard Briers
and Paul Eddington in Middle
Age Spread. S o the intrepid
seventeen rushed hotfoot to
the Lyric Theatre pausing only
to order drinks for the half-time
interval and settled down for
an evening of cheap, civilised
entertainment marred only by a
lack of support from the rest of
the union.
L o o k i n g back to the Soccer
Sixes, since there was no R C S
a r t i c l e l a s t w e e k , a n o t h e r
enjoyable afternoon's entertain-
ment was savoured by only a
handful of hardy amateurs, mot
of w h o m couldn't tell one end
of the football from the other.
D e s p i t e a n i n t r i g u i n g league
s y s t e m , d e p e n d e n t o n t h e
single-transferable goal and/or
p l e a b a r g a i n i n g m o s t t e a m s
r a p i d l y d i s c o v e r e d t h a t a
m o d i c u m of skill was necessary
to win a jug of beer. N o t so
R C S U and I C U . In an act of
u n p a r a l l e l l e d c o r r u p t i o n a
p e c u l i a r a r r a n g e m e n t w a s
made between the teams of the
two presidents. B y allowing each
other to score goals they hoped
to transgress their o w n league
and move onto the Super Bowl.
However, despite letting each
others feeble shots in they still
c o u l d not get the r e q u i r e d
number of goals, corners, four-
leafed clovers and rabbits' feet to
go through to the final.
In a three-way play-off for first
place the I C P A s w o n with the
B i o c h e m P G s second and C h e m
2 third. The absence of any team
f r o m P h y s i c s , t h e l a r g e s t
department in College makes me
wonder if there is an exit from the
Blackett L a b or if Cyrogenics are
having another go at suspended
animation.
O n t o the s u b j e c t of r a g .
M o n o p o l y , usually a huge event
m a n a g e d to a t t r a c t a m e r e
nineteen people who exhorted
about £200 from the public. A
free bus-rover went to everyone
who collected more than £1.25
and so you all missed a chance to
see L o n d o n for nothing and help
another deaf child hear the w o r d
indifference through a brand new
radio hearing-aid.
Finally dates of forthcoming
events:
Rugby Sevens: This Sunday,
10th February. If you can get the
name of your team to Ray
Myers, C h e m 2 by midday you
could still be playing.
Valentines Disco: Friday 15th
February in J C R . B u y your
tickets in advance or else, like
the Halloween Party, you won't
get in.
Valentines Rag: Saturday 16th
February 9:30ish R C S U . C u p i d s
and W o r l d s Greatest Lovers-
S e d u c e r s o r G a n g s t e r s (St
V a l e n t i n e s D a y M a s s a c r e ) .
A n y w a y , as a footnote, if you
want to stand for any U n i o n post
next year drop into the Union
Office anytime for a cup of coffee
and a chat to find out what it's all
about.
