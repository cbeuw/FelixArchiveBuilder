Ragged Heroes is I.C. Radio's Folk
Programme and as such allows it's presenter
Eric Jarvis, an opportunity to give an airing (some
of them are old enough to need it) to any records
(fusty or otherwise) that take his fancy; of course
with the restriction that they can loosely be
described as Folk music. Hence interspersed
between Martin Carthy and Richard Thompson,
your ears (provided that you haven't stuck your
fingers in them) wiil be assaulted by the likes of
Thin Lizzy, Al Stewart, Sonny Boy Williamson,
George Thorogood, Roy Harper, Bill Nelson,
even live recordings (sic) of Folk Club, a topical
pome, the Colonel (and his thoughts and
ramblings on the degeneracy of the nation as a
whole, and Monday's programme co-ordinator in
particular; sorry Sarah), and Blind Lemon Pledge
(the one-armed deaf, dumb and blind blues
singer).
All this and more (e.g. nervous breakdowns,
live on-air) can be yours for the price of a tranny,
every Monday night from 6 to 7pm.

E X T E R N A L
A F F A I R S
I C U at present receives its funding from
College. T h i s is done by negotiating with
College each year based on estimates from
the past year. Most other S U s however,
are funded on a per capita system from
L E A s and are thus totally autonomous
from their colleges. H o w e v e r , the L E A s
cannot negotiate with the unions concerning
the p e r c a p i t a r e q u i r e d . T h e s e u n i o n s
negotiate with their colleges to decide a
fair payment w h i c h the L E A s must then
pay.
Both these systems have anomalies, in
o u r c a s e w e c o m p e t e w i t h a c a d e m i c
departments for our money, a n issue which
will feature more a n d more in years to
come as college finanaces are restricted
and must only result in a decrease i n ' o u r
U n i o n facilities. In the autonomy case it is
possible to make ultra vires payments, eg
in the past one college made payments to
the I R A . (We have policy against ultra
vires payments!) Also colleges can agree
with unions to increase the per capita by
large amounts if unions allow some of the
money to go to the colleges.
T h e whole system of S U funding has
been under discussion for some time now
and three proposals have been made:
1. Flat-rate fee (£15-20) from L E A s and a
set amount from colleges.
2. V o l u n t a r y membership a n d amount
from colleges.
3. Block amount to U G C (j£15m) distributed
to colleges a n d college/union negotiations.
T h e problems with each of these is that
again unions are competing with academic
departments for money. T h e alternative to
this is that the U G C earmarks some of the
college grant for unions, but this would
r e q u i r e S t a t u t o r y I n s t r u m e n t s to be
passed in Parliament and some M P s have
said that they would not be passed.
T h e problem with autonomous unions is
that there is no public accountability and
a S U may misuse the money allocated to it
as above, but the legal restrictions on the
use of this money have increased — ultra
vires payments (payments to bodies outside
one's own responsibility eg to other unions)
are illegal. Also the L E A s must make
payments in which they have no negotiating
power.
However the per capita system in the
p r e s e n t e c o n o m i c c l i m a t e m u s t be
preferential to that in which unions must
c o m p e t e w i t h a c a d e m i c d e p a r t m e n t s
finance.
N B I C U spends approximately .3% (''/,„„„)
of its total income on External Allairs.
