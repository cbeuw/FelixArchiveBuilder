A N D Y LEWIS LIVENS UP U G M WITH A D V E R T
OPPOSING T H E CORRIE
BILL
Last Tuesday several members of
I C U joined the N U S march and N A C
rally opposing the Corrie bill. The
N U S march from U L U to West-
minster was attended by about
4,000 students and also supported
by some nurses and other unions.
By the time we reached Westminster
there were already thousands of
people at the N A C rally in Central
Hall and in the lobby queues. At
the rally, among others, D a v i d
Steel, Liberal M P , spoke out in
favour of the act he authored (the
1967 act). He stressed that however
much we try to improve society,
women will always need abortions,
and it is right that this should be
catered for. He was greeted with
enthusiastic applause.
Today, Friday 8th February, when
in all probability the Corrie Bill will
have its third reading, there will be a
women's assembly from 1:00pm
onwards in Central Hall, followed by
a torchlight procession at 5:30pm.
AMNESTY
INTERNATIONAL
PRISONERS RELEASED
We are happy to announce that
both of the IC Amncity Club's
p r i s o n e r s h a v e r e c e n t l y b e e n
released. Mr B Nyathi, a Zimba-
b w e a n , was r e l e a s e d o v e r the
summer though we have only just
received confirmation of this from his
wife. He was convicted of a political
offence shortly after the declaration
of UDI in 1965. Seven years later,
shortly after the completion of his
sentence, he was detained without
trial under an Emergency Powers
Act. He is now 'free' but restricted to
a particular region of Zimbabwe. He
has been unable to find a job; partly
because this is always difficult for ex-
political prisoners and partly because
whilt he was in jail he developed an
injury to his foot. His family is
c o n s e q u e n t l y in n e e d of s o m e
financial support.
The Indonesian was working as an
engineer until he was detained, along
with over a h u n d r e d -thousand
others, shortly after the attempted
coup of 1965. We know very little
about him but have been writing on
his behalf to various authorities over
the last three years. Last week we
received notice that he has been
released.
T o the knowledge of AI, neither of
these have either used or advocated
violence.
We will send some money to help
both people soon. The collection
during last Tuesday's U G M collected
£25, we are grateful to all those who
contributed.

The Rector, T h e Lord Flowers,
featured in a cartoon on the front
page of last Friday's Times Higher
E d u c a t i o n a l S u p p l e m e n t . T h e
cartoon was coupled with an article
discussing the possible effects of the
almost complete report on the
financing of medical and dental
education in London.
The cartoonist, Dave Smith, said
that he drew the cartoon from a
photo of The Lord Flowers.
