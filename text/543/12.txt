SINGLE ROOMS FOR £3.50 A
WEEK
A s many IC students will k n o w from
personal experience, it is very difficult to
find a place to rent, at a reasonable price,
in L o n d o n . The problem is so great that
l o c a l c o u n c i l s o f t e n h a v e to h o u s e
homeless families in hotels or bed and
breakfast places. S o it is rather surprising
that there are tens of thousands of empty
properties, often council owned, dotted
around L o n d o n . M a n y of the houses are
awaiting redevolpment — which may take
years — some have simply been 'lost' by
the bureaucracies involved, others are
somewhat derelict, and so on. The aim of
the B a c k d o o r H o u s i n g C o o p e r a t i v e
formed at IC last year, is to make use of
these 'short-life' houses for its members.
Empty houses are easy to spot —
especially if they are boarded up! O n c e
found, chances of success are best if the
property is council owned. The hard part
is to persuade owners that participating is
to their advantage. Typically a group of
members from the cooperative might take
over a house and live in it for six months
to several years at a tent of £3.50 per
week. The owner benefits because an
occupied house deteriorates more slowly
than an empty one. If the owner is the
local council then an additional 'perk' is
the rates revenue, paid by the cooperative
o u t of t h e r e n t r e c e i v e d . A f u r t h e r
advantage to the owner is that the group
u n d e r t a k e s r e a s o n a b l e r e p a i r s to the
house. M o s t importantly, homeless people
are housed at low rents.
O n e such house is being run by the
group in M o r t l a k e (SW14). A n unfurnished
house of four bedrooms, lounge, kitchen,
bathroom and two gardens was occupied by
four students at the cooperative's rent of
£3.50 each per week. S o u n d interesting?
Furniture and equipment has been bought
second-hand, or scrounged, and despite
some early problems (like flooding the
neighbouring house!) the place is now very
comfortable, the licence will probably last
for six months and maybe longer. Houses
which needed lots of-work would only be
used if they were available for longer and
structural repairs would be paid for by the
cooperative — this is why a rent is collected.
If you like a Bohemian life, surrounded by
paint pots, fuse boxes and copies of
Alternative London; o r if y o u a r e
cooperatively minded and would help run a
group to try and house people (including
yourself), c o m e to the next meeting on
Thursday 14th February at 12:45pm in the
S C R (first floor, U n i o n Building) and help
decide about:
1. Street surveys to find more houses.
2. Registering as a limited company (this has
legal advantages).
3. The cooperative's bank account.
