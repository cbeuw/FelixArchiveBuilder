O n c e upon a time, there lived a
s t u d e n t w h o felt t h a t a d e n of
technology like IC ought to have a
society based upon the visual asthetics.
Thus came into being the shady world
of Graffitti. Wandering, homeless and
destitute, these persecuted individuals
were banished to the haunted West
Wing of the Union Buiiding. O n the
second floor of the stair case to the
left of the r e f e c t o r y , t h e r e s u c h
d a n g e r o u s w o r d s as G r a p h i c Arts
c o u l d be kept far a w a y f r o m the
milling Engineers and Scientists (and
miners) so as not to corrupt their
devotion to technological endeavour,
and the Gross National Product.
S o m u c h for the f o u n d i n g . T h e
purpose of the society is to provide an
outlet for anyone's artistic ability. The
facilities are open for any graphic arts
(drawing, illustrating, lettering, etc).
O v e r the y e a r s , the interest in
screen printing developed; as a means
of producing volumes of publicity or
as an end in itself. (Incidentally, about
20% of modern printing is by this
m e t h o d . ) T h e a c c u m u l a t i o n of a
home-made light table, a photosoc
cast-off enlarger, drying racks and a
vertical screen washing trough fol-
l o w e d ; t o g e t h e r with the largest
collection of inks and papers (just)
East of the Royal College of Art.
W h a t y o u m a y a s k , is s c r e e n
printing? Imagine a method of squeez-
ing ink t h r o u g h a s t r e t c h e d mesh
screen. Partially block out the screen,
as in the diagram, so that only letters
or designs are left clear for ink to pass
through, and that's screen printing.
The blocking out is mainly by a
photographic process, transferring any
design on transparent film, or trans-
lucent drafting film.
T h e i n k p a s s e s t h r o u g h o n t o
whatever you put underneath; poster
paper, tee-shirts, badge size paper, tin
cans, plastics, or the table! The chief
advantage is that any surface can be
6 fcOCK
printed on with the range of profes-
s i o n a l e q u i p m e n t a v a i l a b l e . M o s t
p a c k a g i n g , tee-shirts, most f a b r i c s ,
wallpaper, and enormous posters are
the main uses.
With the equipment we have, you
could produce tee-shirts, badges or
posters for your pet society, hall or
house, or for your own enjoyment.
Megalomaniacs can see their work all
over College and further. Societies
are free to commission posters up to
SRA2 size (on extended A2). What is
really needed is people willing to take
up commissions. A little technique can
cover for a lot of detailed artistic
ability. Imagination is the only limit to
the possibilities. Any potential Andy
Warhols out there? There's no reason
why your work shouldn't be as good
as any; we use professional inks and
equipment from Sericol, the largest
suppliers in Europe.
Anyone is welcome to pop up to the
w o r k s h o p at l u n c h t i m e W e d n e s d a y
afternoon, seems to be the most active
p e r i o d at the moment. O r c o n t a c t
