octors are not going to
accept the new contracts
that Jeremy Hunt is
trying to impose on
them,so they’re planning three more
strikes as well as launching a judicial
review.The government condemned
the announcement, arguing that
the contract will improve services.
However, Dr Johann Malawana
(leader of the BMA junior doctor
division) states that the general
consensus amongst junior doctors
is rejecting the imposition: “the
government must put patients
before politics.”Also the BMA have
found legal grounds for a challenge
and if the Equality Act (2010)
equality impact assessment has not
been carried out, they will take the
government to court. However,
Danny Mortimer, chief executive
of NHS Employers stated that the
majority of the BMA’s concerns
had been addressed in the final
contract and urged junior doctors
to reconsider.This is the most bitter
clash since the creation of the NHS.

t Sh!t Sc!ence, we argue
that all research, no
matter how ridiculous,
has a purpose and brings
us all closer to the truth.
This week: penguins. You thought
you knew just how adorable
they were, but that was until you
heard the news that makes them
frigging awesome. Fat penguins are
scientifically more likely to fall over.
This is what results from a study
hailing from the University of
Roehampton suggest, in a paper
aptly titled ‘Fat King Penguins
Are Less Steady on Their Feet’.
The authors reminds us that
very comprehensive studies have
previously shown that pregnant
women and very fat people, have a
completely different gait than thin
people (would we dare to say they
waddle more?). So applying this
research to penguins just makes
common sense, really.
And this story just keeps on
getting better. To substantiate their
MARIANNE GUENOT
Sh!t Sc!ence
Thin penguins waddle, but fat penguins wobble
claims, they captured fat penguins,
put them on a treadmill, and filmed
them. Which means that now, all
over the internet, are videos of
penguins on a treadmill!
The results show (who cares, at
this point, right?) that although the
gait and stride length of penguins
remain the same, regardless of
their weight, fatter penguins have
a higher “leaning angle and leaning
amplitude’’. Translation? Fatter
penguins waddle normally, but they
wobble more! Complete happiness
ensues.
This all sounds mildly ridiculous,
but as always, it serves a greater
purpose. This research subscribes to
a wider line of enquiry called gait
analysis, the study of locomotion
of humans and animals. Carefully
studying the dynamics of humans
when their motions are hindered,for
instancebydebilitatingdiseasessuch
as Cerebral palsy and Parkinson’s,
has helped doctors develop new
treatments and surgeries. Studying
the gait of animals can give us a
different insight into dynamics
of locomotion, which can, for
instance, help us develop more
effective robots.
The gait of penguins has been
studied since the 1970s, and
has been puzzling scientists
ever since. Whereas penguins
seem very at ease in water,
part of their life cycle involves
traveling huge distances on land,
painstakingly and awkwardly
dragging themselves step-by-
step while conserving enough
energy for them to make the
journey, sustain themselves, and
feed their female and newborn
chick. Studying their gait can
give us insights into a previously
uncovered mode of locomotion.
So next time you see a cute
animal doing something stupid,
grab a camera and immortalise
whatever shenanigans might be
taking place. For science!
