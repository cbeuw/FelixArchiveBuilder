Goodbye old friends

ast Sunday saw our
last game of the season
against the Bath Killer
Bees, the Immortals were
determined not to end the season
with a loss; however, after a long
game, the score was 49-8 to the
Killer Bees.
We started out the game with
a kick off. After a fantastic kick,
the defensive team were on. The
defense were extremely strong and
were able to stop the Killer Bees
from advancing. After the fourth
down, the offensive team were on.
With a miraculous QB sneak,Kevin
Kim swerved and ran through the
defensive lines and, from our red-
zone, scored an amazing touchdown
(two point conversion successful).
Afterwards,the defensive team were
able to force a fourth down near
our end-zone but, due to a fumble,
Bath were able to recover with a
few yards to spare from their first,
much-needed, touchdown. With
that advantage, Bath were able to
score making it 6-8 as the two point
conversion was unsuccessful.
Unfortunately, afterwards, the
Immortals defensive players picked
up injuries and with a lack of
players, many offensive members
were forced to play both ways. A big
shout out to the offensive linemen
who stepped up in a time of need
and filled in where necessary. With
the lack of players, special teams
were lacking organisation and many
players had to step into fill the
gaps before snaps. With a fatigued
Immortals squad, Bath were able
to take advantage and piled up
touchdowns. This unfortunately
ended with a score of 49-8; we wish
the Killer Bees a good and successful
trip up to Sterling and for the rest of
their season.
After the game, as is our tradition
after every last match of the season,
the Immortals formed a tunnel for
the leavers; I would like to dedicate
this section of our match report to
the leavers: Jonathon Robert Joseph,
Marcus Stead-Hall, Bami Falana,
Emanuel Oladayo Olagbaju, Rhys
Kilian, Noach Ben-Haim, Kevin
Kim, Paulius Viskis, Rayane M.
Jackson and Alex Brockhurst.
Jonathon Robert Joseph, played
for the Immortals and American
football for the first time this year,
playing fullback. Jon has been an
essential part to the team this year,
on and off the field, being loved by
all.
Marcus Stead-Hall, ex-publicity
officer and running back/full back
has been with the club for five years.
Through his days he’s been known
to specialise in cut blocks, with any
linebacker fearing to get on the field
when seeing him. Bami Falana,
joined the club last year and was
always playing running back until
his last game of this season where
he was playing as a linebacker and
a defensive lineman. His athleticism
is known to all around; with his pace
and strength he was a massive asset
to the offense.
Emanuel Olagbaju, current
secretary, has played for the club for
four years. Throughout his glorious
career he played as a running back,
slot, and a defensive lineman, his
power and agility is famous within
the team and the American football
community in the country, his
trucking count is off the charts,
and any defensive player going up
against him would crumble against
the fear of being destroyed.
Rhys Kilian joined the team this
year as a wide receiver however, his
versatility and experience meant that
he was playing in other positions
such as quarterback and running
back, through which he performed
phenomenally. Loved throughout
the club, Rhys will be missed on and
off the field.
Noach Ben-Haim, undoubtedly
one of the best receivers this team
has ever seen, has been with the
club for two years and before that,
played at Coventry University as

The
Immortals
were
determined
not to end
the season
with a loss
a wide receiver as well. His speed
and strength have been such an
important part of this team’s offense
and he has had many highlights
including his one handed reception
in the last game.
Kevin Kim has played since 2011,
starting out as halfback then wide
receiver then quarterback this year.
He is known around the team not
only for being extremely tough
when it comes to receiving hits, but
also for being an all round fabulous
person. He has lead our team to
many touchdowns and he will be
missed.
Paulius Viskis, an absolute beast
of a defensive player, has played
for three years as a linebacker and
a defensive end. His brute strength
would cause any quarterback to
shiver in fear.
Rayane M. Jackson also played
as a defensive lineman and
running back and is well known
for being a monster both ways.
His determination and passion has
brought the team up many times
and his craze for sacks has led to
him to becoming an amazing player.
Finally, Alex Brockhurst, ex
treasurer and current sponsorship
secretary for the club, has been
in many positions including
linebacker, safety, corner back and
running back. He has always been a
massive part of the team, whether it
is on the field or behind the scenes
in terms of running the club. He is
truly a tremendous player causing
a lot of havoc for anyone going up
against him.
The club would like to thank all
the leavers for their contributions
and we wish them a successful
journey for the rest of their careers!

Medals aplenty for the rowers
Newcastle’s BUCS Head up proves a successful trip for the team

Head was moved from
the metropolitan Boston
to the tropical Newcastle
this year (a Head race is a rowing
time trial, rather than a side by side
race). ICBC sent up 22 of our finest
athletes to compete on the Sunday,
in an attempt to prove that the
strength of our squad is defined by
quality, not quantity.
After a seven hour drive up to
Newcastle on the Saturday morning,
there were doubts about the race
going ahead at all. The conditions
were abysmally windy and choppy
during our paddle on Saturday
afternoon and we came off the water
wet, cold and apprehensive about
the racing tomorrow – the forecast
was only meant to get worse.
After a hearty meal from some
uncomfortably friendly Northerners
and a good night’s sleep in the
finest accommodation north of
the M4, the crews were ready for
the first races of the day. The first
boat to race the 4700m course was
a coxless four of Andrew Halls
(Club Captain, 4th
year Materials),
James Redhead (Civ. Eng. exchange
student), Alex Ball (2nd
year Mech
Eng) and Juha Lepannen (3rd
year
Mathematics). This crew raced
well, navigating the unfamiliar
Tyne river to secure a silver medal
in their Championship category,
behind the home favourites of
Newcastle University.The next crew
off was a coxed four of Ben Thomas
(Environmental Tech. MSc), Toby
Heaton (2nd
year medic), Tristan
Vouilloz (3rd
year Mech Eng), Ollie
Hines (3rd
year Theoretical Physics)
and cox Chris Au (Environmental
Tech. MSc). This crew managed to
do one better than their teammates,
beating Edinburgh and Newcastle
to win a gold medal.
The final crew in this division
was a lightweight (less than 75kg)
coxless four of Paul Jones (PhD
Biomaterials), Romain Barnoud
(PhD Computer Science), Rob
McPherson (2nd
year Materials)
and Myles Holborough (3rd
year Materials). The four upheld
Imperial’s strong lightweight track
record by winning a bronze medal
in their category. The afternoon
offered more challenges for the
rowers. Wind had picked up,
meaning that the racing would be
slower this time round.It was time to
bring out the big guns for the finale
of the weekend’s racing – the men’s
eights. We had two eights racing at
BUCS: one championship eight,
contested by British universities
for the fastest student eight in the
country, and one intermediate eight.
Our intermediate eight was made
up of people ICBC coached from
complete novices at the start of the
2014/15 academic year. The crew
was Dugald Fraser, Tom Burnell,
Jac Reid,Fabio Albertani,Lawrence
Jones, Vitaly Delve, Paul Liétar, JT
Baird and cox Emily Boother. This
eight would be competing against
university second eights, because
of the ruling against entering more
than one boat in a championship
event. Our championship consisted
of some familiar names: Romain
Barnoud, Toby Heaton, Ben
Thomas, Ollie Hines, Tristan
Vouilloz, James Redhead, Andrew
Halls, Myles Holborough and
Chris Au. The eight set off second,
following Newcastle down the
course and brought the prized gold
medal home to London! Finally,
the intermediate eight put in a
storming performance to come 5th
when competing against far more
experienced rowers.
22 athletes sent up to Newcastle,
22 BUCS medals brought back to
London. A good day in the office
for ICBC and it bodes well for the
rest of the season!
