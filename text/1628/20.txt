P
eople often speak about
the risks of anorexia and
bulimia – how they can
kill you, make your bones
brittle and your hair fall out.
However, I want to talk about
one very overlooked side effect,
Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).
For many years I have starved and
punished my body. I have abused
laxatives, purged perpetually, binged
frenziedly and outright refused to
eat.Historically,my behaviours have
left me in a critical state however my
recurring battle now lies with IBS.
IBS is a fairly common complaint
and is overlooked as a harmless
idiopathic syndrome. However,
IBS dictates my life and impacts
both my physical and emotional
health. I am 21 years old and I
cannot eat without severe bloating,
stomach pains and gastric reflux;
I live off Gaviscon and other
gastric medicines. I suffer from
gastroparesis and irritable bladder
syndrome. I do not have normal
‘bowel habits’ and suffer from rapid
and extreme fluctuations. I am
somewhat incontinent; my bladder
is weaker than a 40-year-old woman
with 5 children. I cannot bounce on
a trampoline, I cannot sneeze, and I
cannot hold it in. Much of my life
revolves around the loo, I cannot
sleep through the night or go on
Life after anorexia: IBS
long journeys and despite being
told that with weight restoration
my symptoms should ease, that has
not been the case.Almost five stone
later and my symptoms have not
subsided.
I hope that in time things will
ease but I worry that this is a life
sentence.
Not a day passes in which I do
not regret how I have abused my
body. I did not think I was harming
myself or that my behaviours held
consequences.
Nonetheless, the cold hard reality
remains that if you abuse your body
eventually it will break. The human
body is an amazing and resilient yet
fine tuned machine, it will adapt
and survive under challenge but like
all things, it has its limits.
Your body needs energy. Your
digestive system needs food and
is meant to work in a ‘forwards’
direction. If you abuse this balance
then ultimately your body will begin
to reject food and it will fail to digest
as nature intended.Your metabolism
will cling to energy giving you a
somewhat ‘fatty’exterior meanwhile
your stomach will reject its contents
after years of abuse. Re-swallowing
food has become a daily occurrence,

and they are not without risk. If you
are suffering please do not dismiss
the damage to your health, it is
very real. Eating disorders and their
side effects do not need to be a life

have the power to break free.
