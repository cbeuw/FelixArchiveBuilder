cross the spectrum of
living organisms we
have species that are
adaptable and flexible,
known as generalists, and those
who occupy unique niches and
exploit them maximally, known as
specialists. Raccoons are generalists
– they’ll eat anything, anytime,
anywhere. On the other hand, koala
bears are specialists; they can only
eat eucalyptus leaves, live in trees,
and need warm climates.
This simplified dichotomy is also
mirrored in the scientific world.
There are highly specialised experts
– for instance, those who research
things like vascular remodelling
in systemic and pulmonary
hypertension, and generalists
like the field naturalist who
integrates knowledge of botany,
ecology, engineering, management,
chemistry, etc. in systems research.
Recently, with increasing access
to higher education and the
entrenchment of institutionalised
learning, specialised focuses in
sciences have become increasingly
commonplace. In turn, this has
begun to spawn generations of
highly specialised scientific experts,
who may spend years working on
one particular problem or issue.This
stands in stark contrast to the idea
of the ‘Renaissance Man’, known
also as polyhistors or polymaths.
This was an ideology touted during
the Renaissance and Enlightenment
periods – arguably the beginning of
modern science – where someone

Science, what’s good?
A
team of chemists
and engineers at the
University of Texas
have found a simple
and inexpensive means of directly
converting carbon dioxide and
water into liquid hydrocarbon
fuels; a revolution in terms of
sustainable fuel technology. Oxygen
by-product is reverted back into
the system along with its positive
environmental impact.
The reaction involves
concentrating light, heat and
high pressures driving a one-step
conversion of carbon dioxide and
water producing the hydrocarbon
fuels which are currently used in
cars today.This gives the technology
an important advantage over battery
and gaseous-hydrogen powered
vehicle technologies, providing a
sustainable alternative fuel which
requires little modification to the
fuel distribution system. Hopefully
the process can be implemented for
everyday use in transport.

abies born by caesarean
section are being wiped
with their mother’s vaginal
fluid in attempts to boost
their gut bacteria microbiome, and
reduce risks of allergies and future
obesity.The logic behind the practice
is fairly simple, caesarean born
babies are not exposed to the birth
canal, so it is a means of manually
transferring the microbiome to the
baby in an attempt to remove any
future health risks associated with
caesarean births.
However, there is a lack of
evidence for the effectiveness of
the practice. It may even introduce
the baby to the risks associated
with harmful bacteria such as the
group B Streptococcus, causing
fatal infections in the newborns.
Such risks would have otherwise
been dodged. With little evidence
in favour of the effectiveness of the
practice, is it worth the exposure to
these risks?

ccording to scientists,
looking at someone
for no less than a few
milliseconds is enough
for you to decide how they fit on
your ‘likeable’ scale. D Schiller
and his team at the University of
Basel in Switzerland performed
an Implicit Association Test on
football fans. Participants’ responses
to concepts such as ‘love’ and ‘death’
as well as subject response to the
names of players on their own
versus the opposing team were
tested. Electrical neuroimaging
helped to investigate the individual
level processing steps during
subconscious social assessments.
The potential of modern electrical
neuroimaging is demonstrated
by the study. Investigations are
currently being undertaken to see
how these results can be used to
facilitate diagnosis and therapy of
mental diseases involving social
deficits.

umans are once again
appointed felon in the
Ecological community.
Zoologists Rudman
and Schluter documented reverse
speciation in the British Columbia
Lakes, particularly Enos Lake on
vancouver Island. Introduction
of Crayfish species was found
to cause the extinction of two
native threespine stickleback fish
only three years after Crayfish
introduction. A new hybrid species
now monopolises this ecosystem.
The ecological roles of the previous
native species have been lost.
Ecological linkage has caused a
resulting dominos effect between
species, systems and scales. Changes
in these aquatic ecosystems have
transgressed to the surrounding
terrestrial landscape.

ontroversy over pay
cheques for men and
women is not a novel
concept. However, a
recent study found that even on
Ebay, the transgression exsists. Men
and women were tasked to sell
the same items on the auctioning
website, and the results indicated
the men earned more; specifically,
women earned 79 cents on the
dollar. An explanation proposed is
that this gender pay gap is due to
the way products are described by
men and women on the site. Men
tend to use more flattering terms
than women. However, even when
sentiment was controlled for, the
gender gap was still apparant.
More interestingly,this gender gap
was larger for new items than used
items, with a 19% compared to 3%
pay gap respectively. One possible
explanation for this is that people
subconsciously trust the judgement
of women to describe good quality
over men.

Auctioning with
a gender gap
who excelled physically, socially,
artistically, and in numerous
intellectual fields was revered as the
great thinkers and thought to spawn
innovative creativity.
This transition from valuing the
jack-of-all-trades to the master-of-
one marks a distinct cultural shift
in science. On the one hand, with
increasing numbers of scientists,
engineers, and researchers across
the board, it seems natural that
we would settle into specialised
niches; if we are freed up from a
more surficial knowledge of many
things, we can delve very deeply
into a singular problem or topic –
which surely is beneficial. However,
the crux of that issue comes when
it’s time for researchers to resurface
from that depth and share those
findings in such a way that the
knowledge is beneficial for society
at large, which is not always
common. Another issue is that in
losing generalist perspectives, we’re
losing cross-disciplinary ideas and
holistic ways of thinking that are
quite useful in problem-solving and
innovation.
So while we’ve dove head first
and perhaps unconsciously into
specialisation, maybe it’s best for
the scientific world to take cues
from the natural world and retain
a mixed balance of specialists and
generalists, so that we can benefit
from these two very different, yet
equally valuable mindsets and ways
of undertaking scientific research.

cientists are sent back to the
drawing board as researchers
suggest “hobbit” skull
probably doesn’t belong to
an ancient human.
The perpetual mystery of human
evolution has just lost a potential
grandfather of modern humans.
In 2003 the remains of a new
primate species, Homo Floresiensis,
was discovered in a cave on the
Indonesian island of Flores and
were thought potentially to be a
version of modern humans. It’s easy
to see how their colloquial name
of ‘the hobbits’ stuck; the average
individual was estimated to be
three foot tall and weighing 25kg,
meaning they would be by far the
smallest species closely related to
humans. Initially, the specimen was
generally accepted to be a form
of early human that lived 15,000
years ago. This theory suggests the
reason for the shrunken stature
and grapefruit sized brain was due
simply to a genetic defect that spread
within this isolated population. An
alternative theory was the specimen
was an ancestor of Homo erectus that
had undergone insular dwarfism
due to a shortage in the food supply,
obtaining their hobbit like structure.
However, recent research strongly
indicates that the hobbit species
Homo floresiensis may not be part of
Homo at all.
It may seem news of little
consequence but the findings have
ignited a controversial debate about
these specimens, since previous
inconclusive research has suggested
multiple explanations for these pint
size primates. A study published
in the Journal of Human Evolution
documents results from state of the
art analysis of a layer of the most
intact of the nine skulls excavated
over the last ten years. The results
from the analysis, such as skull bone
thickness indicated that the skulls
showed “no characteristics from
our species”. Even with extensive
specialisation, it is expected that
there would be some common
features between modern humans
and the remains if indeed they were
part of the Homo line. Additionally,
analysis of the skull showed no signs
of significant genetic diseases that
would have to have been present
for the data to support the original
theory.
This opens up the mystery species
to a multitude of questions about
their origin and their relation to
other primate species, including
our own. Despite the wealth of
information gained by the analysis,
the researchers remain unable to
identify what the species is likely to
be. Lead author, Antoine Balzeau
said, “So far, we have been basing
our conclusions on images where
you don’t really see very much.There
is a lot of information contained in
bone layers of the skull”.
Even though the analysis provides
strong evidence that the species
isn’t ancestral to Homo sapiens, the
study failed to rule out the second
hypothesis. Therefore, it remains
possible that the hobbits were a
subset of the ancestral group to
Homo erectus that became smaller
over time due to lack of key
dietary requirements like iodine.
However, it is also possible that
the remains represent the existence
of a whole separate species, which
would open up a whole other can
of worms for scientists trying to
untangle homo sapiens increasingly
complex phylogeny. Balzeau simply
concluded: “For the moment, we
can’t say one way or the other”.

the catastrophic
c o n s e q u e n c e s
a landslide can
have. Only last week, 250 people
were trapped in their hometown
in Idaho, USA, as a result of a
massive landslide blocking the
highway connecting them to the
rest of the world. This week, one
man died and another two were
injured during a minor landslide
in Ara Damansara, Malaysia, and
five villages were covered in dust
and debris threatening residents
with suffocation, as a result of a
dry landslide at Myagdi, a popular
tourist destination in Nepal.
However, landslides are not a
phenomenon limited to terrestrial
environments. They are known to
occur underwater as well and may
have devastating consequences.
Around 8200 years ago, such a
landslide occurred somewhere
between the North Atlantic and
the Arctic Ocean, off the coast of
Norway. Sediment that had been
collecting for thousands of years at
the edge of the continental shelf
started sliding down the Norwegian
sea resulting in area of sediment the
size of Maine travelling at speeds of
over 40 miles per hour.
This massive relocation of land
also moved tonnes upon tonnes of
seawater, sending tsunamis crashing
over northern European shores
submerging areas as far as 20 metres
underwater.
“It’s hard to even comprehend the
size of a landslide like this,” says
geologist PeterTalling of the United
Kingdom’s National Oceanography
Centre.
“A single landslide can move more
sediment than all the world’s rivers
move in a year.”
Althoughunderwaterlandslidesof
this magnitude are not as common,
smaller landslides do occur more
frequently than you might expect.
Many are known to have taken
place only in the last few centuries,
often causing small tsunamis, with
recent research suggesting the 2011
Tsunami that struck Tohoku, Japan,
was only as devastating as it was due
to an underwater landslide triggered
by the earthquake.
In the past, the only evidence of
these immense geological events
was scarring of the seafloor, which
could only be recognised through
comparison of different seafloor
mapping attempts. A series of
underwater landslides that occurred
at Prince William Sound in the
Gulf of Alaska in 1964 were only
identified 60 years later, after a new
mapping expedition compared its
results with the previous map which
had been generated 16 years prior to
the landslides.
Now through the employment of
advancements in sonar technology
we are able to get a more detailed
glimpse into the history of such
phenomena. Multibeam sonar, for
example, provides a detailed model
of the seabed surface,while sparkers,
electrodes emitting high-frequency
acoustic pulses can penetrate
multiple sedimentary layers. Such
data can provide information on the
size, shape and path of landslides.
Yet, even though we now know
more about these phenomena than
we did before, predicting when the
next underwater landslide might
strike remains a challenge.
“Right now, to answer that
question, one of the best things we
can do is keep looking for evidence
of past landslides in places that we
know have had big tsunamis’’ says
Lesli Wood from the Colorado
School of Mines.
Indeed, with such range of size,
impact and conditions surrounding
these events, it is hard to formulate
rules to predict when, where and
how powerfully the next one might
be. Topography, water quality and
sediment composition all affect
how the seabed might react, so
detailed analyses of seafloor samples
from earthquake ridden areas can
provide crucial data that can help
build predictive models.
Topromoteresearch,collaboration
and awareness, Wood created an
open source database describing
over 300 landslides based on their
shape and size. She hopes that
soon the database will be enriched
with much needed geological data
that will enable risk assessment of
precarious areas, providing crucial
information to the engineering
community.
