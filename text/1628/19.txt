On the shoulders of literary giants
David Mitchell and Kazuo Ishiguro discuss ghosts, action and what they avoid writing
I
t was an odd set-up – the
2500-seater Royal Festival
Hall packed to the brim,
eagerly watching just two
individuals on stage. Sat slightly
angled towards each other and
separated by an unassuming coffee
table were two of the greatest
literary figures of our time. I was
seated right at the back (everything
else was sold out), and their figures
were dwarfed by the massive screen
behind them with their names
emblazoned across. Kazuo Ishiguro
and David Mitchell may be the only
two people on a vast stage regularly
used for entire orchestras or dance
troupes, but their presence filled the
space around them and commanded
the attention of rows upon rows of
fans, writers, geeks and the curious.
Clearly, their words have touched
the lives of many.Being a passionate
fan of Kazuo Ishiguro’s books, I
had eagerly signed up for the event
entirely because of him without
actually realizing who David
Mitchell was. I mean, I’ve watched
Cloud Atlas,but I am ashamed to say
that I have never actually read any
of his books. On the other hand, I
count Ishiguro’s Booker prize-
winning novel Remains of the Day as
one of the books that have changed
my worldview, and his short story
collection Nocturnes completely
overturned my ideas of the magic
that can be done with beautiful
language.
However, this event turned out
to be exceedingly fruitful precisely
because of the dialogue between
the two arguably similar but
ultimately very different writers.
Mitchell describes his first book
promotion event abroad where he
was pleasantly surprised to find
an impressive crowd, only to learn
that they were all there for Ishiguro,
who was also at the event. He is
fifteen years younger than Ishiguro,
but the two are good friends, often
sending each other manuscripts
for comments and exchanging
ideas over the telephone. At one
point, Mitchell talks about how the
multiplayer board game Dungeons
and Dragons inspired him as a child
– to which Ishiguro replied that he
had mentioned the game to him
before, but he had no idea what it

was because he was probably too
old!
Friendly banter permeated much
of their conversation,which was split
into three sections, each preceded
by a clip. Since the event was titled
“Among Giants and Ghosts”, it was
only appropriate that the first clips
were from the films Sixth Sense and
The Innocent. Interestingly, they
disagreed fundamentally on what
they found scary about ghosts –
Mitchell narrated a story his brother
told him as a kid, about a misplaced
liver and his grandfather’s ghost.
Ishiguro, however, contended that
that was more horror, which he
thought was distinct from eerie,
fear-inducing beings and events.
Horror didn’t scare him – what he
found scary was simply the existence
of the supernatural, a being at the
edge of reality.
To Ishiguro, ghosts show that
“our control over the world is
not complete”, and that was
what scared him. Writing, then
“unleashes this force or power”.
“Do you write because you want to
create something out of nothing,
then?” Mitchell asks. Ishiguro’s
stories often deal with characters
that are struggling with ghosts
within themselves, or the ghosts
of decisions that they have made.
Living in Lord Darlington’s estate
long after its days of glory, Stevens
from Remains is constantly haunted
by the mistakes of his past.
The second clip was from a samurai
comedy film, where two samurai
stare at each other, tension building
up palpably without any movement
at all,until both of them slash across
at the same time.Ishiguro points out
that Mitchell is far more acquainted
with writing action scenes than he
is, and the pair went on to discuss
the value of writing about action,
considering that films can do a far
more vivid job. Mitchell points out
that it is the build-up to the fight
that makes or breaks the game in
writing action, not the exchange of
blows itself. Raising the example of
War and Peace, Ishiguro adds that
writing also allows one to move
more effectively between the micro
and macro aspects of the action.
At one point, Ishiguro brought up
that he found Mitchell “remarkably
fearless as a writer, perhaps even
reckless”.

Despite keeping a notebook of
ideas, Ishiguro said that most of
them didn’t end up anywhere as
he found it greatly uncomfortable
to write outside of his personal
experience, almost like he did not
have a right to.
“Do you hesitate in the same way?”
he asked Mitchell, who replied that
he had a point of writing books that
are quite different from one another,
and in that process he tends to
veer into the unfamiliar. However,
both agreed that there are certain
cultural and political areas that they
felt compelled to avoid, because
the right to write them “had to be
earned”– such as African American
literature being so richly filled by
native writers.
Perhaps this avoidance of real
history stems from a fear of
misrepresenting the past and doing
injustice to real tragedy. I do not
personally see anything wrong with
appropriating history in works of
fiction, if a particular time or event
suits the creative plot one has in
mind. No one bills novels as history
books, and there is no obligation to
be accurate, after all.
It was a great pleasure listening
to two great writers chat, on this
whirlwind tour across a range
of issues. I will never cease to be
amazed by the capacity of human
imagination that creates words and
images so elaborate and beautiful
that speaks to so many people at
once.“Among Giants and Ghosts”is
an appropriate title not only because
of the discussion of ghosts and
fantasy, but because these are two
giants of contemporary literature.
