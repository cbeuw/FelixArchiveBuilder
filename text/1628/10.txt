T
ypical. You spend ages
waiting for a blood-
spattered neo-Western
film, and then three
come along at once. In the past
few months Quentin Tarantino
made a welcome return with his
potboiler gore-fest The Hateful
Eight, Leonardo DiCaprio dragged
himself through miles of wilderness
in The Revenant, and now we have
Bone Tomahawk, a horrific traipse
through cannibal-infested deserts,
directed by screenwriter and author
S. Craig Zahler. Midway between
them, Bone Tomahawk manages to
be more inventive and memorable
than either.
The story is one of a classic
Western: a small town is terrorised
by a group of Native American
‘savages’, who disembowel
farmhands and steal away town
doctor, Samantha O’Dwyer. The
sheriff teams up with Mr O’Dwyer,
backup deputy Chicory, and
local womanizer John Brooder,
embarking on a journey to kill the
Indian tribe and rescue the captives.
The main bulk of the story happens
within the first half hour,leaving the
remainder to languidly unspool, as
the motley crew face down raiders,
gangrene, and cannibals.
Kurt Russell is on excellent form
as Sheriff Hunt; he could have
wandered off from the set of The
Hateful Eight, beard intact. As the
bumbling old widower Chicory,
Richard Jenkins is endearing, and
similarly Matthew Fox inhabits the
world-weary character of Brooder
well, giving him a wit that – while
not razor sharp – is still the most
cutting that side of the Mojave.
However, the real draw here isn’t
really the acting; it’s the script.
Zahler made his name as a novelist,
and his talent with both description
and dialogue is obvious here. The
dramatic opening perfectly builds a
tension that remains a background
hum throughout; there is no
climactic battle, no dramatic scenes,
but just four men making their
way agonizingly slowly through
the desert. The writing is extremely
witty too, the drama punctuated
by lengthy sojourns about the best
way to read a book in the bath.
While there is not much dialogue,
Zahler makes sure each line shines,
stripping it of extraneous bloat,
until he is left with a sharp bone of
speech, gleaming in the desert sun.
Of course, the idea of a group
of white men facing off against
Native American ‘savages’has a long
history in the Western genre; that
the dehumanising image was used
to justify colonial atrocities should
inspire more than a twinge of guilt
in the viewer. However, the way
Zahler writes the antagonists means
they don’t resemble any form of
humanity, let alone a real American
tribe. Early on in the film the men
ask for the assistance of a Native
American tribal expert: ‘They’re
not my own kind,’ he says, ‘Men
like you wouldn’t distinguish them
from Indians, even though they are
something else entirely’.
And he’s right. The tribe have no
language, communicating through a
series of mystical howls; they cripple
and blind the women members of
Kurt Russell, stealing scenes as the town sheriff, in the bloody, brutal Bone Tomahawk. Photo Credit: Shutterstock

The good, the bad, and the cannibalistic
Bridging the gap between modern Westerns, Bone Tomahawk shines through
the group to keep them docile and
in the most memorable scene of
the film – which I won’t spoil here
– they graphically mutilate one of
the characters. In short, they are
sub-human, filling the same role
as zombies or vampires in other
horrors – a surface upon which
humanity can project their worst
fears. I question whether such a
portrayal is any more offensive than
those where Native Americans are
‘peaceful mystics’ or ‘noble savages’,
existing in a state of communication
and harmony with nature, gifted
with a deep insight into the balance
of the world. Such portrayals posit
the Native Americans as something
to be ‘understood’ by the white
settler, who acts as a pupil for the
Indians’ teachings about the world.
It would not be remiss here to
mention The Revenant, which
portrays Native Americans as
both horrifically violent savages,
and revered spiritualists, in touch
with the history of the earth. Bone
Tomahawk eschews this, and –
while certainly a gamble – is all the

stronger for it. It is also, perhaps, a
stronger film than The Hateful Eight
– certainly, it is less saturated with
quick-fire dialogue. And while all
three films revel in their violence,
Bone Tomahawk is the one that
strikes the balance just right: in
The Revenant the brutality rung
hollow, becoming meaningless; in
The Hateful Eight blood was strewn
across the set with such aplomb
it brought down bathos on the
dramatic proceedings; but in Bone
Tomahawk there is a sense of real
violence, not inflicted unwillingly,
but certainly not gratuitous.
Bone Tomahawk doesn’t shy away
from violence, but it never feels
like an ordeal, something to just
get through in order to reach the
triumphant payoff at the end. In
Bone Tomahawk the biggest danger
isn’t the wilderness, or the savage
tribes, but the men who inhabit it,
and this is the film’s biggest strength.
As Samantha O’Dwyer says: ‘This is
what makes frontier life so difficult.
Not because of the elements, or the
Indians, but because of the idiots!’
