begins to speak in a disarmingly
informal fashion as he demonstrates
the capabilities of the various audio
effects which will be used live in the
performance. The play relies on a
totally immersive sound experience
due to the lack of other actors and
scenery. This is made possible by –
among other things – the strange
head, which is revealed to be a
binaural microphone – one which
records sound in three dimensions.
In this threadbare setting, he begins
to weave the almost hallucinogenic
fabric of a totally different world.

the performance – not unusual.
But now it seems all the more
appropriate as we find ourselves in
an ‘auditory plane’ soaring above
the ground. Suddenly, McBurney’s
daughter’s voice interrupts him and
he begins to have an exasperated
and very real conversation with her,
although her voice is actually a six-
month old recording. And so, the
entire mood and cleverness of his
piece is set from the off: where does
the boundary lie between the past,
present and future?
A performance which involves
the audience wearing headphones is
at first slightly disconcerting. I am
used to seeing, hearing and reading
stories, but this was an entirely new
experiment in storytelling: I was
living the tale. McBurney evokes
pictures of the Amazon rainforest
using his own voice as an aural
paintbrush, along with items on
the stage and at times a classical
soundtrack.The art he creates ranges
from stomping out the hauntingly
rhythmic beats of a tribe’s strange
dance to sloshing a water bottle
until it is a turbulent river. All this
along with his convincing rendition
of the deep American accent of
Loren McIntyre, whose voice
seems to evoke the presence of the
photographer with us.
McBurney’s voice and the sounds
of the Amazon are just “behind
your frontal lobe” as he himself
put it; both physically and – as we
were soon discover – mentally. In
the play McIntyre’s adventure in
the rainforest transcends into a
philosophical journey and this is
portrayed very effectively. It is said
that radio sparks the imagination
and television kills it, and this
was never more evident: soon, I

represented within my own head
– perhaps the best stage for the
strange story that was to ensue.

less chronological. This non-linear
view of time and space is also
accepted in physics where time
can have multiple dimensions, and
yet it never seemed so tangible as
when listening to the, at times,
trippy performance. We sometimes
jump, not only through McIntyre’s
life, but through McBurney’s own
past which in a way mirrors the
story, further creating a sense of
discontinuous time and drawing
into question the vague boundaries
between people’s lives.
This is a performance of
alternating senses of togetherness
and isolation. The simple lighting
provides a powerful mental stimulus
– adding character to the sound
yet not detracting from its impact,
becoming at some points rain, and
at others fire. In the background,
the anechoic wall upon which
much of the lighting dances is
shaped as such that it looks like a
large optical illusion, appropriate
to the psychedelic and almost
uncomfortably deep experience that
McBurney is planting while inside
our heads.
Much of the piece’s brilliance
stems from the fact that McBurney
knows many of the ideas he
wishes to share are not explainable
in words. This phenomenon of
communication through thought
as opposed to language is a theme

pervades the piece, alluding to that
empty void full of sound within our
own heads.
Overall, I would describe this
production not as a production
but rather more accurately as a
timeless piece of art about nature:
as a brilliant performance which
manages to capture the essence
of an exotic location and people,
but also the nature of our own
minds whether time really exists
as we know it. Rest assured you are
guaranteed a powerfully moving
performance.
WALEED EL-GERESY
The Encounter is on at The Barbican
until 6th
of March. Tickets from £10.
T
he audience sits calmly,
unaware of the storm
that is poised to strike.
A single figure stands
on stage in pyjamas. There are no
other voices in this narrative, no
props or distractions. The only
ornament of this stage is just a girl,
half-formed.
She is a stranger just yet.
By the end, we know her story
intimately – we know her intimately.
If we look hard enough,we can even
recognise a part of ourselves in her.
Based on Eimear McBride’s novel
of the same name, A Girl is A Half-
Formed Thing was adapted for the
stage by Annie Ryan,and performed
solo by Aoife Duffin. This play
follows the journey of a girl from
birth to the golden age of twenty.
Told from the girl’s perspective, we
hear a stream of thoughts and inner
discourse as her life meanders into
adulthood.
Far from the predictable coming
of age story, this is about finding
strength and fortitude in the face of
a cruel reality.The girl is abandoned
by her father shortly after birth.
She must cope with a controlling
mother and the everyday reality of
her brother’s terminal illness. She
is sexually abused by her uncle at
13. Sex becomes an escape and an
anaesthetic for her. Her exploration
shows that female sexuality is a
powerful thing: both a crippling
curse and a powerful gift for a young
woman in today’s world.
Despite the manifold,she remains
resilient in her search for meaning
and a sense of self.

Eimear McBride’s astonishing novel is transformed into an empowering performance
This is a play of striking simplicity.
Most modern plays seem garish
and superfluous. The bare stage
becomes Aoife’s playground as
she paints us a scene beyond the
sparse set, mixing the bold outline
of her body language with the more
intricate brushstrokes of her speech.
Although the language of the play
is indicative of the its Irish roots, it
doesn’t really matter where the story
takes place; its narrative is distinctly
universal.
The real magic comes from the
masterful scripting. The syntax has
a poetic rhythm to it, but ventures
beyond the limits of literary
convention. Surprisingly, her words
remain relatable, maintaining an
unflinching honesty. Like the girl in
the title,her thoughts and her words
are half-formed, fragmented, and
hurled at us with no apology, fast
and slow, hitting each point with
searing precision.
The play tackles a much more
general commentary on society,
and childhood. It would be unjust
to relegate this play to any single
genre. Empowering for people of
all genders, it demonstrates a great
beauty in resilience.

Half Formed Thing is a play for a
brave and pioneering audience. The
subject matter can be emotionally
demanding, and disorienting at
first. However, it still rewards a loyal
audience with a memorable and
thought-provoking performance.

recounts the story
of Loren McIntyre
– an American photographer who
travels into the Amazon rainforest
to attempt to capture on film an
elusive, indigenous people called
the Mayoruna. It quickly becomes
apparent, however, that this story
did not happen in the past alone,
but is also happening in the present.
This is uniquely done through the
engaging auditory experience.
The stage looks entirely
unprepared; it is as if a rushed
rehearsal is just ending, rather than
a theatrical production beginning.
Bottles of water are strewn here
and there and an inconspicuous
cardboard box lies abandoned beside
a table. Perhaps the only thing
which points to anything out of the
ordinary is an Easter-Island-like
head that sits alone atop a stand in
the middle of the stage.It is perhaps
unknowingly an omen of the lonely
world inside our heads into which
we are about to be plunged.
