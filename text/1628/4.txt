Kent students want Thatcher statue
In a story straight out of Hangman, Kent Union’s Tory Society are campaigning for a
76m tall iron statue of the Iron Lady
D
ing Dong, the witch is
dead, but not for these
students in Canterbury,
who want a 70m tall
idol of their idol built outside their
union’s Metric equivalent.
The campaign is in its second
stage, which involves collecting
signatures, having already been
approved by their union.
The petition, which currently has
88 signatures, has ten more days to
get the 150 it needs to proceed to
the next level of consideration.
The Conservative Society’s chair
says although it started off as a way
to highlight flaws in the union’s
petitioning system, they are now
“going to run with it”.
This is not the first time Kent
University’s Conservative Society
has campaigned for a statue of
Thatcher. Two years ago, just after
her death, a committee member
called for a marble statue of her
likeness to be built by the union.
Unsupringly, he was downvoted to
oblivion.
Thatcher, who was the first
female Prime Minister and in office
throughout the entirity of the 1980s,
was a fierce campaigner against
unions, once calling unionised
striking miners, “the enemy within”.

“...in Jeremy Hunt, Health
Secretary” which has currently over
320,000 signatories, making him,
on paper, more unpopular than
Syrian airstrikes.
Several Freedom of Information
requests made by journalists into
meetings the government has had
with companies specialising in
private healthcare have recently
been rejected with the government
citing the need for a “safe space” for
ministers to discuss policy freely.
It is likely that this will not be the
last of the story before the contacts
come into force in August of this
year with a spokesperson for David
Cameron saying “it is regrettable if
they are going to strike again. I’m
sure discussions will continue”.

Despite attempts by Labour and
Lib Dem Lords last year to lower
the age to 16, voters must also be
18 or over. It is suspected that 7.5
million people are missing from the
electoral register. Students in halls
must now sign themselves up, so go
to gov.uk/register-to-vote to make
sure you can vote on the 23rd
.
It is likely that Imperial College
Union will fund campaigns lead by
students for both sides, with grants
of up to £400 available.
There is also the possibility that
a motion for either camp could be
presented at Union Council, which
could then potentially be voted in as
an official union stance.
The Vice-Chancellor of
Cambridge, the President of the
LSE, the Vice-Chancellor of
Oxford and the Provost of UCL
were also among the 103 university
leaders who signed the letter.
