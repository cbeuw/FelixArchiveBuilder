ICU MTSoc Presents SweeneyTodd
I
suppose you can never
really tell which of your
friends would make the
most convincing serial killer.
When auditions were running for
MTSoc’s production of Sweeney
Todd back in December, the titular
role of the murderous barber was
hotly contested with auditionees
flocking in from as far afield as
King’s College to throw their hat
into the ring. So when 2nd-
year
physicist Nick Bradley secured the
part of Sweeney - undoubtedly one
of the most coveted characters in all
of musical theatre, and in his debut
performance with the society no less
– quite a few people were surprised.
While Nick, at 6’11” (at a guess),
is as physically imposing as they
come and is known throughout
the college for the quality of his
beautiful singing voice, he’s one of
the last people you would guess is
likely to grab the nearest razor and
begin slashing merrily away.A night
in the union with him reveals in
him an aptitude for banter, a pining
for New Orleans, and a passion for
music but not a thirst for blood.
However, the second the cast
saw Nick perform “Epiphany”,
the turning point of the musical
and arguably the most exhilarating
number in a show full of exhilarating
numbers, everything became clear.
It turns out that the man of many
talents is also an exceptional actor.
During the first run of the show the
only note director Pete Noden made
for the scene was “Nick – a little bit
of wee came out”.
Nick leads a colourful and
exceptionally talented cast of
characters as they tell the tale
of Todd, a barber wrongfully
imprisoned who has escaped
capture and returned to London.
Encountering his old neighbour
Mrs. Lovett, he plots his revenge
with her on the Judge that sent him
away and took his daughter. Along
the way he meets a naïve young
sailor (played by myself), a half-
crazed beggar woman, an “Italian”
barber and his servant boy, and a
beadle working for the judge. As
the story unfolds, these characters
collide with each other in ways that
will impact them forever.
Whilst the story itself is thrilling,
the legendary musical score
(composed by the great Stephen
Sondheim) is what makes the show
the masterpiece it is.Tackling one of
the most challenging productions in
all of musical theatre was something
that the entire cast found daunting
as the rehearsal process began, but
under the rigorous musical direction
of Henry Harrod each number has
been polished clean as a whistle.
It has been woven together with
dexterity into a sonic tapestry that
glistens more and more brilliantly as
the show progresses.
Henry’s commendable efforts
in finding a top-quality band have
also paid off – at the first band
call when I sung “Johanna”, one of
the most well-known songs from
the show, I was filled with a new
love for the number as I heard the

beautifully powerful swell of brass
that underscores it.
The songs themselves also give
the performers a chance to shine,
and each and every member of the
cast has risen with gusto to the
occasion. The exceptional singing
talents of the ensemble gives every
chorus number a strength that
sends chills down the spine, and the
leads match that power with their
performances; standouts include
Emma Watson’s portrayal of Lovett,
with a belt range that would put
any performer to shame, fresher
Fergus Wade’s mesmerising turn
in the role of servant boy Toby, and
Ehsaan Shivarani’s show-stopping
appearance as barber Adolfo Pirelli,
who leaves the audience laughing
with every minute of the little stage
time he has.
The directors’ choice to include
songs that are traditionally
considered optional also bolsters the
performances of the leads; first year
chemical engineer Laurence Ankers’
portrayal of the beadle Bamford
explores the attics of the human
hearing range with his high notes,
Hatty Campbell’s beggar woman
fully expresses every dimension
of the haunting character, and
Arun O’Sullivan’s Judge Turpin
has his shocking chance to make
everyone in the audience squirm
in discomfort. Roshani Abbey is
also a highlight, showing off her
beautifully smooth soprano range
in the heart-warming “Green Finch
and Linnet Bird” solo.
It has to be said that the duets are
often the most stunning part of the
show; the fabulous interweaving
that builds between the four voices
of Anthony, Johanna, the Judge and
the Beadle by the end of “Ladies In
Their Sensitivities” is truly magical
to take part in, and a moment that
took place in AS2 when glittering
rays of sunshine danced through
the windows and onto the backs of
MTSoc’s Sweeney Todd will get your blood pumping Photo Credit: Cem Hurrell
Nick and Emma as they performed
the breath-taking duet “My
Friends” remains the highlight of
the rehearsal process for me.
While I enjoy nothing more
than to wax lyrical about the power
of the show, and while listening
to the soundtrack can do a lot
to communicate the thrill of the
musical, there truly is no substitute
for seeing these exceptional
performers in the flesh. So gather
round and attend the tale – it runs
from the 2nd
to the 5th
of March in
the Union Concert Hall, and tickets
are already selling like hot pies.
It promises to be a truly unique
production, and is likely to be one
of the best in MTSoc’s history.

O
n 17th
February 2016,
the 5th
New Financial
Worlds Conference
was successfully held
at the state-of-the-art Bloomberg
Auditorium in London.
The day was split between
Investment Banking and Global
Markets. The diverse range of
speakers left attendees with an
unparalleled understanding of the
two areas. With an inside-scoop on
how to break into these exclusive
divisions from the industry’s best,
attendees are now better equipped
to differentiate themselves amongst
the fierce competition.
The day started with a talk
from a Managing Director at the
Investment Banking Division of
Goldman Sachs. Having worked
at the division for close to 20 years,
his extensive experience quickly
expanded attendee’s knowledge on
debt financing and LBOs.
The next speaker was Omiros
Sarikas, a principal advisor at AHV
Associates LLP, a private equity
firm. With a long track record in
M&A and PE/VC, he diligently
explained the life cycle of a fund,
their position in the financial world
and how attendees should align
themselves to the industries’ needs.
Christopher Wickli from Citi
rounded off the Investment Banking
session with an excellent summary
of what ECM involves and the
characteristics that make a successful
banker in this area. The first Global
Markets speaker was Nigel Khakoo,
the Global Head of FX Trading at
Nomura International, who focused
on Abenomics and derivatives.
Using a recent example he explained
the use of options in order to take
advantage of central bank events.
Our final speaker, Marc Mourre
(pictured), the former Vice
Chairman of Commodities at
Morgan Stanley, is widely acclaimed
as one of France’s most famous
bankers and, true to expectations,
provided an eye-opening view on
the future of the oil sector.

New Financial Worlds Conference
With a drinks reception to
conclude, the Conference was
extremely well received by students
and speakers alike, with a number
of students having successfully
networked with our speakers and
recruiters! Indeed, for anyone
IC Finance Society hits 2000 members
L
ast Tuesday Imperial
College Finance Society
(ICFS) successfully
overtook Medical
Education(thebiggestdepartmental
society) in terms of membership. By
Friday, ICFS reached yet another
milestone by becoming the first
society to exceed 2000 members.
What is it that has brought
more students together than
any department at Imperial? As
a career-orientated society, the
main focus of ICFS is organising
events for its sponsors. Networking
sessions and trading games had
attendance at an all-time high,
with several boasting more than
200 attendees. Some students even
received invitations for an interview
the following day and secured their
dream job as a result. In particular,
ICFS caused a riot outside Eastside
bar when hundreds of suit-wearing
members queued for a chance to rub
shoulders with City professionals
(and free pizza!).
It’s not all to do with finance,
though! ICFS also held its first ever
social event – those that gave it a
chance had one of the best nights
of their life, with food and drinks
on us all night. Our annual dinner
promises to be even better with
more than £70 subsidy per person.
We also heavily subsidise our
two international trips: the New
York trip with all expenses paid for
22 members (including one lucky
winner of a completely free trip!)
and the Tanzania microfinance trip,
whichgivesmembersanopportunity
to volunteer their skills to help
grow small sustainable businesses
in close-knit communities. We also
teamed up with RAG to promote
corporate social responsibility by
delivering the Charity Challenge of
2016, where Raincatcher Imperial
won £1500 for their outstanding
charitable efforts.
Following on from the success
of our New Financial Worlds
conference at Bloomberg HQ, we’re
also hosting the London FinTech
Conference 2016 in collaboration
with other universities. CEOs
and leaders of ground-breaking
startups will discuss the future of
the industry, with an opportunity to
network and potential job leads.
We also hosted the University
Investment Banking series, where
both categories were won by
Imperial teams, beating the likes of
Cambridge and LSE.
Theteambehindarecord-breaking
year is the ICFS committee, who
have dedicated a lot of their free
time to using the resources they had
available to the best of their ability.
The result is clear: our members
have gained insight into the
industry, made good contacts
and had fun while doing it. With
election time looming, people are
extremely determined to be on next
year’s ICFS team- it has accounted
for around 200 new members. Will
you be part of our story?
