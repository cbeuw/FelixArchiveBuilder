ello to you. Now,
let's get down to it.
It's election time on
multiple levels, and we
should probably talk about both.
Yeah, this is the last week of
freedom from Big Elections spam,
so I'm going to lecture you about
them – y'all should vote.Y'all should
definitely vote.
We've seen some stuff happen in
the last few weeks that has suprised
a few of us by showing how much
power the union really has. Don't
you want some influence over who
has that power? And, of course,
who gets the power to manipulate
what's really happening into a
weekly bundle of news, features,
entertainment and general digital
content for Imperial generations Y
and Z?
Next year,I will be long gone from
this place. I will delete all of you off
of Facebook (unless you have given
me solidarity likes on my weaker

Cokes when I'm at the V&A. I'm
still going to vote in the freaking
elections, and not just because I'm
a hack or because on the union's
voting stats page it shows how many
out of the six sabbs have voted. I
also feel morally obliged because of
Emmeline Pankhurst and shit.
If you can, you should probably
think about voting in the EU
referendum as well. There's a good
chance you've dropped off the
electoral register, what with the
Tory rule change,discouraged by the
Electoral Commission, that's meant
770,000 names have been deleted.
Yours could be one of them! C'mon
they're reading of your texts, at least
register to vote. The solution to this
problem is inherently Googleable,
and you just need a proof of address
to make everything right again.

Letters
Madam Editor,
I was surprised to see that
President Alice Gast has signed the
round-robin letter (Sunday Times
21/02/16) organised by the Britain
Stronger in Europe group, which
campaigns to keep the UK in a
fundamentally unreformed EU at
all costs.I hope Prof.Gast will make
it clear that she supports the letter
in a personal capacity and does
not speak on behalf of the entire
university, which of course contains
a much greater diversity of opinion
than this letter suggests.
I found it very curious that Prof.
Gast believes that, “in the EU
the UK is … a more attractive
destination for global talent”. Surely
to attract global talent we should
adopt an immigration policy which
treats all nationalities on an equal
footing, rather than arbitrarily
privileging EU immigrants
over those from other countries.
Allowing free movement from the
EU in a time where restriction of
immigration is government policy
makes it more difficult for talented,
high calibre immigrants – such as
President Gast herself – to join us.
What about collaboration?
Neither CERN nor the European
Space Agency, two of the world’s
greatest scientific collaborations,
are EU bodies. Participation in the
ERASMUS and Horizon 2020
programmes is not restricted to
EU member states, so UK students
would still have the opportunity
to study abroad and academics
would still be able to collaborate on
international research if we vote to
leave the EU.
Imperial is especially well placed
to thrive post-Brexit due to its
strong academic links with the East:
“Imperial College London strives
to be China’s best academic partner
in the West”, as Prof. Gast recently
said. Furthermore, many of the
problems that scientists are trying
to solve, such as climate change, are
global rather than regional in nature.
These problems require worldwide
co-operation.
Finally, on funding. We all know
that the UK is a large net contributor
to the EU budget. In the event of a
Brexit, the UK government could
match or increase the funding that
research organisations receive from
the EU. In any case, EU science
funding is miniscule: the European
Research Council plans to spend
£1.3bn across the entire EU in
2016. The Department of Business,
Innovation, and Skills will spend
£5.8bn on UK research in the same
time period.
In the 21st
century, distance has
never mattered less. Thanks to the
Internet, it is as easy to collaborate
with Auckland as with Aachen
or Aberystwyth. We have always
been an outward looking nation: In
order to continue as a world leader,
we must raise our eyes from the
calcified trade bloc that is the EU
and look to more distant horizons.
The world is calling to us. How will
we answer?

-Ed. The EU referendum back in 1975 got a few Imperial students going then too.

is arguably the first time your vote
will matter as much as anyone else's.
If you have any opinion on Britain's
place in the world, trade blocs,
human rights laws, or the ease with
which British teens can interrail,
you should probably have a little
think about voting.
