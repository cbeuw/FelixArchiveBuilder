L
ately there’s been some
strong comic book TV
adaptations debuting,
ranging from the gritty
atmosphere of Daredevil to the fun
and colourful world of the Flash.
Marvel’s Jessica Jones manages to
bring another successful, while at
the same time different, mood to
the table. Focusing on the more
shady side of the Marvel Cinematic
Universe, the show has very much a
noir feel to it.
The show features Krysten
Ritter as our titular hero, a hard-
drinking PI with superpowers and
a mysterious past. Ritter is on full
form, being perfect as Jessica Jones,
someone with rough edges who’s
been driven into a more secluded
nature due to the terrible stuff she’s
been through. She has the right
balance of wit and arrogance and
in spite of everything, still has an
innate desire to help others and be a
hero.It’s nice that in spite of the wall
she’s built up around her, she has
empathy for the people victimised
by the villain Kilgrave and the main
focus of the show is her efforts to
take him down.
David Tennant gives an amazing
performance as Kilgrave, being as
goodasVincentD’onofrioasWilson
Fisk in Daredevil, if not surpassing
him.Kilgrave has the ability of mind
control, making people do whatever
he wants them to while at the same
time being a narcissistic sociopath
domination. He simply acts in the
moment, doing whatever’s on his
mind with anyone who’s present. At
one point he remarks how difficult
it must be not to have his powers,
showing how deranged he truly is.
It’s a testament to Tennant’s acting
skills that he can charm you with
his humour and likeability, even
making you sympathise with him at
times,before turning and reminding
you why he’s so repulsive.
An interesting choice made by the
showrunner, Melissa Rosenberg, is
not to shy away from the fact that
Kilgrave is a rapist, both mentally
and physically, and tackles head
on the consequences of what he’s
done to so many people and how it
changes them. The show takes the
idea of a supervillain to its scariest
and most evasive place while making
sure not to lose focus or devalue the
people who have been victimised by
him. The writers don’t back away
from this and give opportunities
to show how the characters process
what has happened to them and
work on what to do next in wake of
such a violation.
The remaining supporting
characters are also portrayed well
and help to bring out different
aspects of Jessica’s personality.
Carrie-Ann Moss as Jori Hogarth is
a ruthless and manipulative lawyer,
being a shark of the world of law
while Jessica’s neighbour Malcolm,
portrayed by Eka Darville, is
sympathetic and endearing. Wil
Traval portrays Will Simpson, an
adaptation of the character Nuke,
a cop who only sees things in black
and white and has the aura of
having something off about him.
Mike Colter as Luke Cage proves
he’s more than capable of having
his own Netflix series, being tough,
strong and sharing great chemistry
and sexual tension with Jessica.
Thehighlightsupportingcharacter
is Rachael Taylor as Trish ‘Patsy’
Walker as Jessica Jones’s adoptive
sister and best friend. She acts as a
contrast to Ritter’s character and it’s
great seeing how, while being polar
opposites of each other, the two
women support and complement
each other.
A weak link of the series is the
character Robyn, another one of
Jessica’s neighbours. She’s unlikable
in all her appearances and too
heightened and farcical for this
world. It doesn’t help that she gets
more involved in different plot
points as the show goes along. The
number of time and scenes spent on
Hogarth’s marital issues, despite the
payoff, felt like a bit too much.
Also, like Daredevil before it,
Jessica Jones felt like the more
stronger episodes came a little
before the end. I’m not saying the
ending isn’t good ,but the build up
was done much better.
Having said that, Jessica Jones
is still a true triumph adding
something different to the superhero
genre. It’s the most adult entry from
the Marvel Universe with plenty
of R-rated violence and a frank
depiction of sexuality.To the show’s
credit, none of these scenes feel as
if they’re present for shock value or
for show, but rather help depict the
harsh and brutal world of the story.
Jessica Jones is a grim show and
really creepy at times. However,
it’s a compelling series from start
to finish with an excellent lead
character guiding us through the
dark and murky underbelly of the
Marvel Universe.This is a stand out
series, not just for Netflix’s line up
but also for the ever-growing world
of superhero shows in general and is
definitely worth a watch.

T
his show really snuck
up on me. HBO seems
to have pushed it out
without the sort of
fanfare one would expect; especially
given the names attached to this
project. When Martin Scorsese
and Mick Jagger say they’re doing
something together, you pay
attention. So, I decided to give the
two hour premiere (directed by
Scorsese himself) a chance.
Was it worth it? Well, mostly.
The series has certainly managed
to capture my attention, although,
perhaps not as strongly as I’d have
liked. And, it is not without a few
issues that keep it from reaching the
heights I hoped it would. That is, so
far, at least.
First though, let’s discuss the
good. The series explores the
music industry in the 70s; mainly
following record label executive
Richie Finestra (featuring Bobby
Cannavale in a rare starring role)
as he attempts to stay on the wagon
while keeping his company alive.
The performances are all solid, and
the show manages to pull together
quite an eclectic cast. Sporting the
likes of Olivia Wilde, Juno Temple,
and, most bizarrely, Ray Romano;
there really is nothing but praise to
keep hooking the audience back,
and keeping us on our toes as the
show went on.
I’m still interested though, and
the characters and acting mean I’m
invested enough to keep watching.
Ultimately, I have faith in Scorsese
to give us and interesting and
gripping new series.

This opening episode definitely
drags on for too long, and it lost my
interest slightly towards the middle.
It also throws a lot of dangling plot
threads at the viewer from the outset;
slightly overwhelming us, and
making each one seem less weighty.
These should really have crept in
slowly as the series progressed, and
a few particular ones (no spoilers)
would have served as great ways to

A
vengers Earth’s Mightiest
Heroes is a fantastic
journey into fun and
adventure, with writing
that embraces the best elements of
Marvel media as well as the original
comic book roots. With well done,
serialised storytelling, an excellent
voice cast and superb animation,
Avengers EMH is a lot of plain,
awesome fun that anyone can enjoy.
This show adopts the nature of
comic book stories well, having big
adventures with ongoing plots and
subplots to keep you going and
craving the next installment. It does
a fine job of retelling and adapting
classic stories while being original
and keeping things grounded in its
own universe. This series features
all the major highlights of the
Marvel films plus more. It does its
own spin on plots like the Winter
Soldier storyline and an invasion of
an alien race. Without the demands
of a film calling for more grittiness
or realism, this show is able to show
the best of the Avengers. While
sometimes serious, the show is not
afraid to let the more fantastical
elements of comics to appear.
The show also features a large and
rotating team of Avengers. Each
member of the team has their own
quirks as well as their time to shine.
The show makes you interested and
invested in all the characters, even
with the likes of Hawkeye. The
characters themselves have their
own developments and journeys,
whether it’s Thor and his qualms
with his family or the Hulk trying
to gain acceptance from others.
Speaking of characters, the
show features a ridiculously large
leads his own Avengers team into
action.
The voice-acting of the show is
top notch. Every character sounds
original and organic, some of
whom sound uncannily similar
to their movie counterparts. The
animation is also a treat, with a
generous amount of detail as well
as engaging and blockbuster-like
action sequences. Occasionally the
stories are simple and generic and
sometimes plot threads are dropped,
only to be picked up much later. In
spite of this, every episode is a blast
to watch.
This show only did last two seasons
before it was axed making it join the
ranks of awesome shows cancelled
before their time. With amazing
characters, and great stories, this
show was a love letter to decades
of comic book mythology. If you’re
impatiently waiting for Marvel’s
films, this is a show that’ll keep you
occupied until then.

This series
features all
the major
highlights of
the Marvel
films plus
more
number of people from the Marvel
universe. Practically all the major
Avengers villains are shown,
each with their own motives and
objectives. There is also a number
of supporting characters as well as
guest appearances from heroes like
the Fantastic Four and even the
Guardians of the Galaxy. In one
episode, Spider-man forms and
be had here. All the classic Scorsese
hallmarks are also here; from the
protagonist’s verbose narration á la
Wolf of Wall Street and Goodfellas,
to the occasional surreal sequences.
In this piece, they take the form
of cutaways to renditions of iconic
tracks performed by representations
of the relevant icon.
On the topic of the music; the
soundtrack, and its integration
into the episode is just fucking
awesome. There’s also some great
use of visual metaphors throughout;
a particularly effective example
being in the closing sequence of the
episode.
As I said earlier though, the
episode isn’t without its problems.
