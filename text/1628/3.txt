Leeds university begins to sell its own bonds

L
eeds university has issued
its own bond, with an
interest rate comparable to
the UK government’s own
low-risk Gilts.
In an attempt to attract more
international students, Leeds
will use the cash to invest in its
infrastructure, including “high
quality facilities that will enhance
student education” according to the
university’s Vice-Chancellor, Sir
Alan Langlands.
Barclays, HSBC and Lloyds Bank
are acting as joint bookrunners,
meaning they will effectively
manage the issue of bonds on Leeds’
behalf.
The bonds are worth £250 million
in total, will return 3.125% and
are due in 34 years. This interest
rate is around 1% higher than the
government’s 30 year bond.
University bonds are a steady bet
while interest rates remain low.
Several other universities
including Cardiff and Cambridge
have launched bonds in the
last few years that have proved
popular, with £1.25 billion’s worth
being issued. The constant stream
of tuition fee income and the
promise of government backing if
anything were to go spectacularly
wrong make investment in higher
education facilities in the UK look
like a pretty safe bet for pension
funds and insurance firms.
However, the Financial Times
warns investors to keep an eye out
on the government’s immigration
rules if they’re planning on
buying. The loans are being used
to fund investment in student

espite knowing about it
since November, college
officials cancelled the
jump just three days
before it was due to take place, over
health and safety concerns.
The RAG committee were
contacted by senior college
officials last Friday, who told them
the bungee jump would not be
happening.
The jump was rescheduled last
week due to unsuitable weather
conditions, and there were no
concerns voiced by college over the
safety of the event then. The latest
cancellation had nothing to do with
weather, with sources citing issues
with health and safety.
A college spokesperson told us:
“senior College safety staff have
been carrying out final checks
over the last week liaising with
the new bungee jump supplier”
which “unfortunately required the
scheduled event to be postponed for
a time”.
“We are sorry for any
inconvenience this caused to those
taking part but grateful to all
involved for their help in arranging
for the rescheduled jump to go
ahead.”

Estates before Christmas. The plan
was then okayed by college officials,
as it is every year.
FELIX understands that the
President of Imperial College, Alice
Gast, herself may have then raised
concerns about the jump, despite
having been here for last year’s.
On Tuesday, just after FELIX had
published an article reporting the
cancellation, college allowed RAG
to provisionally re-arrange the event
to the 21st
and 22nd
of March.
The bungee jump is a staple in the
RAG week calendar, with students
having jumped from a crane over
Queen’s Lawn for several years now.
This year, students paid £40 for
the jump, and each had to raise the

to attract international students
who pay fees between £15,000
and £31,000 per year over home
and EU students’ measly £9000.
Visa changes could mean that
international student numbers
could fall again as they did last year
by 3% across the UK. At Imperial,
the number of overseas (non-EU)
students was actually up 9.4% in the
2014/15 academic year.

responses to its Green Paper on

a series of radical changes to
university funding, facilities are
