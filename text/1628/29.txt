ome say that it’s the most
prestigious and largest event
known to Imperial’s Cross
Country and Athletics
society, others say that it’s merely
a warm-up jog in preparation for
a night of serious shape-throwing
in the beloved Metric. Either way,
it’s left undeniable that the Hyde
Park Relays of 2016 proved to be
the highlight of many students’
Valentine’s Weekend.
Hyde Park Relays (more lovingly
referred to as HPR) is a historic
event, comprising a mass student
relay race hosted by ICXC&AC
which welcomes both internal
teams, often sporting fabulous fancy
dress, Cross County teams across
the UK and even stretches out to
regular European visitors, such as
‘Poznan Uni of Economics’and ‘The
Flying Dutchmen’. Women’s teams
are composed of four warriors, with
six machines running for both men
and mixed teams. Each runner
covered a 5km route twisting round
the delightful paths of Hyde Park.
Following the event, the teams are
rewarded with what is rumoured
to have been described this year as
a ‘Michelin star standard’ feast in
the world renowned SCR ft baked
potatoes and fruit squash,before the
grand results ceremony.
Now in its 67th
year, prizes were
taken to a new level and presented
as engraved running batons and
an array of sporty goodies, with
podium positions up for grabs for
the following: fastest individual
male and female legs (meaning
laps, but also in the literal sense);
and the three fastest teams amongst
mens, womens, and mixed for
both internal, external, halls. and
international entries. Celebrations
then run well into the early hours
of Sunday morning as Metric is
overtaken by the hoard of elated and
Jaeger fuelled athletes.
This year saw no lapse in the
heroics of the race. Gathering in a
somewhat dreary and cold Hyde
Park on Saturday afternoon, over
100 teams turned up to battle
their way up the results table and

Hyde Park Relays 2016 proves yet again that Valentine’s Weekend is better with a
hangover
PBs set, sweat dripping and, most
importantly, happy faces; although
maybe this was in anticipation of
the dinner awaiting them over in
Uni.
6pm saw the teams gather in the
SCR,freshly showered and ready for
the night to begin, where food was
served by members of ICXC&AC,
even providing second courses for
those who had run up a serious
hunger. Results this year were
outstanding: fastest male and female
legs were awarded to ICXC&AC’s
own Sarah Johnson (17:23) and
Chris Olley (14:39). Meanwhile
the internal awards saw ‘The Gents’
promenade away with fastest male
team and ‘TriIC women’s A’ sprint
their way to victory for the ladies.
Oxford and Cambridge gave IC a
run for their money, taking 1st
and
2nd
place respectively for both the
male and female external teams.
However, IC was hot on their heels,
with 3rd
place for the external men’s
and 4th
for the women’s. On the
other side of the pond, ‘Poznan Uni
of Economics 2’ and ‘The Flying
Duchesses’ skipped away with 1st
international team back for males
and females respectively. Wilson
Halls skidded in with 1st
place for
Halls teams.
After the prizes the teams
descended to the Union for what
is undeniably Metric’s best night
of the year with international boat
races and many, many Jagerbombs.
As the night progressed the
famous Hyde Park Relays horn was
unleashed onto the dance floor with
dire consequences. The rest of the
night descended into a blur for most
but it was undoubtedly the best way
to break into Valentine’s Day.
Chris Olley leading the race for Imperial was the hero of the day by not only being the main event organiser (along with
Felix Nicol) but also running the fastest leg of the day! Photo Credit: Dave Tan
