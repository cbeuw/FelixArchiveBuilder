Junior Doctors strike again
• Three dates set for 48-hour strikes
• Emergency care will still be provided
• Question over legality of newly imposed contract
Imperial President Alice
Gast signs pro-EU letter
The Sunday Times published the open letter
condemning 'Brexit'
O
ver one hundred leaders
of UK universities,
including the President
of Imperial, Alice Gast,
have signed an open letter published
in the Sunday Times, asking the
British public to reject a ‘Brexit’and
vote to stay in the European Union.
The letter says universities are
better able to “collaborate with
partners” and that “our students are
taught by the best minds” because
the UK is in the EU.
As well as stating the benefits
to universities, the letter seeks to
persuade voters that they should
care about higher education as all
of these EU-provided benefits have
a “direct impact on our economy,
driving growth, generating jobs and
improving people’s lives”.
It is unclear whether President
Gast signed the letter in a personal
capacity or on behalf of Imperial
College, although the letter does
state that "as university leaders we
are committed to highlighting the
value of EU membership to our
universities". Imperial did return
FELIX's request for clarification.
Whilst the short letter starts
positively, listing the benefits EU
membership provides, it goes on to
say that leaving would mean“cutting
ourselves off from established
networks” and would ultimately
“undermine” Britain’s position as a
E
ngland's Junior Doctors
are set to strike again with
three 48-hour walkouts
planned for the coming
two months, meaning that planned
operations and procedures may well
be affected, but emergency care will
be maintained.
These strikes, to be held on 9th
of March, and the 6th
and 26th
of
April, are the consequence of the
imposition of a new contract on
the Junior Doctors last week by
health secretary Jeremy Hunt, a
contract which the British Medical
Association (BMA) said would be
“bad for the future of patient care,
the profession and the NHS as a
whole”.
The disagreements between the
government and the BMA largely
revolves around patient safety,
working hours and basic pay rates,
as well as what constitutes overtime,
especially on weekends.
In the mean time, Junior Doctors
have launched a legal challenge
against the government over the
imposition of the contract. They
have applied for a judicial review
to challenge the decision, and are
expected to argue that the ministers
haven't properly investigated
whether the new contracts will
discriminate against part-time
doctors, and so likely unfairly
impact women.
After a ballot conducted in
November showed that 98% of
the BMA’s 38,000 strong cohort of
doctors supported industrial action
in protest to the contracts, Hunt’s
popularity has been slim among
the profession and the wider public
too. He has been accused by the
authors of an unpublished paper of
manipulating figures, which he used
last July when he said that 6000
people die per year due to the lack
of what he called a “proper seven-
day service”.
This came to a head when Jeremy
had to attend a cabinet meeting
regarding the EU referendum on
Saturday morning, the first time
the cabinet has been in session
on a weekend since 1982, which
prompted a flurry of criticism on
social media, mocking him over his
weekend pay cuts and changes to
“unsociable” hours.
Hunt is also the subject of the
fifth most supported House of
Commons petition, “Consider a
vote of No Confidence..."

“leader in science”.
The referendum date was
announced by David Cameron on
Saturday. It will take place on the
23rd
of June,which is the penultimate
day of Imperial’s summer term. The
mayor of London, Boris Johnson,
came out to reporters on Sunday
as a supporter of ‘Brexit’, or
Britain leaving the EU, in a much-
anticipated announcement.
British, Irish and Commonwealth
citizens, as well as citizens from
Cyprus, Malta and Ireland residing
in the UK will be allowed to vote
in the referendum. EU citizens will
not be eligible to vote.
