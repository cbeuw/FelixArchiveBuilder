Scrapping over Scalia

L
ove him, hate him, agree
or disagree with him, it
is undeniable that US
supreme Court Justice
Antonin Scalia was one of the most
divisive and outspoken American
political figures of this generation.A
gifted jurist and bastion of American
conservatism, his aggressive style of
questioning and acerbic put-downs
of opposing opinion made him
respectively loved and reviled by
Republicans and Democrats of all
stripes. His passing, while away at a
luxury ranch in Texas, in many ways
marks the end of a political era.
It also marks the beginning of a
desperatefightbetweenRepublicans
and Democrats to secure control
of his empty seat on the supreme
Court. The Court itself is the
highest level of judicial authority
in America, consisting of nine
members. Since Ronald Reagan
appointed Scalia in 1986, there
has been a modest majority of five
associate Justices widely viewed as
‘conservative’. With Scalia’s passing,
the partisan split between this
‘conservative wing’ and its liberal
opposite number is even, meaning
that whoever can secure the ninth
seat left by the late Antonin Scalia
will have a court favourably inclined
towards their policies.
In this regard, President Obama
President
Obama is
at complete
liberty to
choose
whomever
we wishes
and his Democratic Party have an
advantage.The process of appointing
a justice to the supreme Court itself
is governed by the US Constitution,
which reads: “ He [The President]
shall nominate, and by and with the
Advice and Consent of the Senate,
shall appoint ... Judges of the
supreme Court”. The constitution
is clear: the Senate (currently held
by the opposing Republican Party)
may sign off on a candidate put
forward by the President. However,
they cannot put forward a candidate
of their own.
This brings us to our current
quandry: President Obama is
at complete liberty to choose
whomever we wishes to sit on
the court, provided the GOP
(Republican) controlled senate
approves. However, in the wake of
Scalia’s passing, Senate majority
leader Mitch McConnell has vowed
to prohibit any appointments made
before the next President assumes
office in January 2017, eleven
months from now.
McConnell’s supremely
irresponsible stance on Obama’s
supreme Court nomination will
leave the Court without a ninth
sitting Justice for almost an entire
year, severely weakening it’s ability
to set a binding precedent on a
number of important upcoming
cases. His argument that, because
2016 is an election year, nomination
should wait until the next President
assumes office, is little more than
sophistry: no fewer than five other
nominations to the supreme Court
have been made in election years.
Under this light, McConnell’s call
for a delay is,in equal measures,both
intellectually dishonest and crassly
partisan, a thinly-veiled gamble
in the hope that the next sitting
President will be a Republican. It
is also the potential first step on
a slippery slope: if the Senatorial
majority can hold off on confirming
a nominee for eleven months in
order for the current President’s
term to end, then why not one-and-
a-half, or two years, or longer still?
Politically however, there are few
options available to the Republican
Party: with the passing of Scalia,
there is now an even ideological
split between the remaining eight
sitting justices. Because supreme
Court appointments are made for
life, any appointment made under
Obama would tip this balance away
from the GOP, possibly for many
decades to come. Given that the
supreme Court is a useful cudgel for
both parties to beat down unwanted
legislation (the GOP has used the
favourable 5-4 split afforded by
Scalia to bring challenges to both
Obamacare and the DREAM
Act), and a means to hedge against
challenges to new laws passed by the
GOP held Congress,it should come
as no surprise that maintaining a
conservative majority in the Court
is seen as an absolute necessity for
McConnel and Co.
There is also a Presidential
election to consider. Had Scalia
passed away closer to the January
20th
inauguration date,it would have
been no difficult task to have simply
delayed a vote on the Supreme
Court nominee until after the new
President was sworn in, after which
the previous candidate could be
silently replaced. However, delaying
the vote until Obama leaves office
means that the whole ordeal will
be dragged out for eleven more
agonizing months. McConnell
and his Senate will also need
to provide a strong justification
for denying any nominee a vote:
delaying the appointment of
an otherwise qualified jurist on
ideological grounds will be seen by
the electorate as a nakedly partisan
attempt to misappropriate one of
America’s three legislative bodies.
It is therefore likely that President
Obama will elect a well-regarded
moderate (his current top choice,
Sri Srinivasan, was elected to the
DC circuit court unanimously by
the Senate) and force the Senate
Republicans run in circles as they try
to justify their stance. Should they
be unable to justify their blocking
of an appointment, then they will
suffer for it come election time.
The remaining eleven months
will be an excruciating legislative
battle, for both Democrats and
Republicans. By pre-emptively
calling for a blockage of any supreme
Court nomination, McConnell et
al have put their cards squarely on
the table: even if they do eventually
allow a Senate vote on a nomination,
it should be absolutely clear to all
that it is nothing more than party-
political pretence. If he was still
alive, Antonin Scalia – a vigorous
defender of Constituational
originalism – would surely have
some scathing rhetoric of his own
for Mitch and Co.
On second thought though,
perhaps he wouldn’t...
