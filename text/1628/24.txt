T
he semi-finals of
the International
Championship of
Collegiate a cappella, the
show that last year won the union’s
event of the year, returned last
Sunday, with even more excitement
from last year’s highly anticipated
event. Featuring eight of the UK’s
top university a cappella groups,
competing to a sold-out audience in
the Great Hall. Opening the show
were the University of Oxford’s
renowned male group Out of the
Blue. Durham’s mixed group the
Northern Lights followed, with the
University of Bath’s mixed group
Aquapella. Before the interval was
the anticipated showdown between
the previous winners of the quarter-
finals,Semi-Toned of the University
of Exeter, and the Techtonics of
Imperial. Semi-Toned gave a very
strong and technically sound set,
putting a huge amount of pressure
on the hopeful Techtonics. But this
did not faze them, as they closed
the first half with an outstanding
performance, confirmed by the
standing ovation they received.
Beginning the second set were
mixed group the Bristol Suspensions
(unsurprisingly from the University
of Bristol), followed by mixed group
the Alleycats of St. Andrews. The
Scopes, mixed group of Imperial
closed the competition with a fun
and lively set. While the judges
deliberated the cast of the new all
a cappella musical “Gobsmacked”
gave an inspiring performance.
After they had finished it was time
for the verdict. A sense of nerves
filled the Great Hall as all the groups
stood on stage. Special awards were
announced, notably the Techtonics
winning best choreography for
their rendition of “Bicycle Race”.
Aquapella ranked third, and Semi-
Toned came second. Surely this
could only mean one thing - the
Techtonics were announced as
deserved triumph rewarded with an
exciting trip to New York City to

ntering into the second
term of the last year of
my Joint Maths and
Computing Degree, I
thought to myself, “How can I
distract myself from my work in a
ridiculous way I haven’t tried yet?”.
Having already become captain
of the most obscure sport on the
planet (underwater hockey – don’t
ask), and literally played God in a
DramSoc play last year, I decided
it was time to actually become
God. Sadly, gaining omniscience
is fairly difficult, so I settled on
directing. Sadly, nobody liked the
play I wanted to do, so I settled on
assistant directing someone else’s.
The play in question is Birdland,
by Simon Stephens. It follows Paul,
a rockstar at the height of his fame,
his subsequent downfall, his descent
into madness, and how it alienates
and destroys his relationships
with everyone around him. The
dialogue is sharp and witty, and it
provides interesting commentary
on the celebrities of modern society.
Armed with a script, budget, and a
producer prodding us to get on with
it, we began our search for our cast.
Auditions were one of my favourite
parts of directing, as I got to see the
wide range of acting talent we have
right here at Imperial.
Having being told Leonardo
DiCaprio sadly wasn’t available, we
settled on our cast over Christmas,
and rehearsals began. For the last
six weeks, Jack Williams (the
director) and I have been blocking
out scenes, bringing out emotional
performances, telling actors to “act
higher and/or drunker”,and making
Paul a bigger dick than we thought
possible. I’ve loved every moment of
it.
From the initial idea to the
polished performance, every actor
brings their own spark to a scene,
and it’s the collaboration that makes
the play great. “Try it and see” has
become one of my favourite lines,
because even the weirdest sounding
ideas can really make a scene.

really grown into their characters;
the crew are also fantastic, pouring
nights and days behind the scenes to

and the band have been rehearsing
late into the night, all to bring you
an experience that will be absolutely
fantastic.
really begin to come together is one
of the most rewarding things I’ve
ever done.
Show week is now on us, and
I couldn’t be more excited to see
