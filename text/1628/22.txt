Breakfast at Granger & Co.
FELIX reviews the healthy(er) Aussie breakfast spot
Y
our committed
relationship to Wasabi
for breakfast, lunch,
dinner AND midnight
snack is just not working any
more. You’ve tried everything at
Hummingbird from cupcakes to
whoopie pies, risking diabetes
and an E number overload. You’ve
even set foot into Roots & Bulbs
desperate for something new, green
and wholesomely natural.
That’s it. We are leaving South
Kensington.
Situated on Westbourne Grove,
Notting Hill,Granger & Co.will be
your perfect spot to get your Aussie
breakfast fix. Walk inside to find a
well-lit, airy, spacious room with
clean, marble tables and a casual,
minimalist vibe.
But we have no time to devour the
interior. Let’s get down to food.
I always order a coffee or a hot
chocolate to start my meal. For
some reason they always surprise me
with crazy animal patterns covering
the entire interior of the glass. My
mocha came with a thick layer of
chocolate on the sides, with furious
feline claw marks. And the coffee
itself? GOOD. Finally, something
different from our Library Café.
Now. If you come here without
trying their signature ricotta
hotcakes, you are seriously
missing out in life. Three 1” thick
hotcakes, pan fried to a beautiful
golden brown, stacked on top of
a freshly peeled banana, a knob of
honeycomb butter next to a mini
jug of syrup. Served steaming hot
on a clean white plate. Fluffy, like a
marshmallow. Creamy and velvety
with generous chunks of ricotta
studded inside. Soaked up the syrup
and melted butter like a sponge to
give you that filling, comforting,
buttery goodness in every mouthful.
Trust me and try it. You will never
go back to Wasabi.
You are

50g cocoa powder
1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
1/2 tsp fine salt
235ml warm water
1 tsp vanilla extract
80ml neutral vegetable oil
1 tsp white wine vinegar
100g vegan chocolate chips
(if you can find them)
Preheat your oven to 180°C/160°C
if using a fan oven. Grease/paper a
9”round cake pan,springform if you
have it.
Sift together all the dry ingredients
into a mixing bowl.If you don’t have
a sieve, use the back of a spoon to
carefully break up as many lumps
as you can. In a jug, mix all the
wet ingredients together. Pour the
wet into the dry, using a whisk to
C
akes as birthday presents
are great – so quick,
cheap and the effort
everyone knows you
went to means that even if you mess
it up, people will pretend it tastes
good. Fortunately, this recipe is
virtually idiot-proof. Go ahead, test
that statement.
Makes 1 small cake, for about 6
hungry people with dietary needs –
but can be easily doubled!
Vegan (dairy free) chocolate chips can
be ordered online, or found in one of
the many niche stores in London.
160g plain, gluten free flour
200g granulated sugar
Vegan? Gluten free? Cake? Surely not.
FELIX presents the birthday cake for your “friends” with challenging needs
combine – don’t dump all the liquid
into the mix in one go, as you’ll end
up with lumps. Use a spatula to
mix in the chocolate chips, if using
them, before transferring the mix to
the pan.
Bake in your preheated oven for
~30 mins, when a skewer inserted
into the centre of the cake comes
out clean. Leave to cool for an
hour, then remove from the tin – a
knife around the edge should help –
before letting cool completely,if you
can resist.
