P
latformers (that aren’t made
by Nintendo) have seen a
revival in recent years, with
a large focus on artstyle and
graphical fidelity. Rayman Legends,
LittleBigPlanet, Bionic Commando,
and Shadow Complex are all notable
for their presentation, whether
realistic or stylised. Innovating
within the platforming genre is
hard, so developers often use visuals
to distinguish their work.
Unravel is by all accounts beautiful.
It focuses on the miniature, with a
small protagonist known as Yarny
(made entirely from red yarn).
Trees, twigs, and rocks become, as
a result of Yarny’s size, relatively
massive structures within the game
world. Small rodents, birds and
crabs become large, threatening
enemies.This magnified world, with
its almost lifelike graphics, evokes a
real sense of exploration and awe in
the player.
Thediverseenvironmentsrepresent
more than just places, they hold the
memory of an old woman whose
house acts as the hub world.Yarny is
a physical representation of her love,
crafted by hand, with the red yarn
that trails behind connecting her
memories to help her reminisce.The
memories that the player collects as
they traverse the world exist only
for a brief moment, and even then
they are obscured and blurry. The
trials and tribulations of the player
represent the struggle of someone
looking back on their past, hoping
to find something to comfort them.
There is a sadness and loneliness in
Unravel that underpins everything.
What really sets Unravel apart
from other platformers, is the literal
unravelling of the character you
play as. The red yarn becomes a
support, a rope swing, a lasso, and
a trampoline. It’s length is limited,
forcing the player to carefully
think about the order of their
actions. Unfortunately, many of
the environmental puzzles feel like
they are impossible to complete the
first time you’re faced with them.
Constant deaths, which cause you
to respawn at a checkpoint, ruin the
games otherwise leisurely pace.This
is where Coldwood Interactive’s
puzzle-platformer ultimately
unravels; there is no balance
between punishment and reward.
Unravel is a classic case of style
over substance. However, its style
cannot, and will not, be ignored.
There are a few games that look as
good, especially from development
teams this small. More frequent
respawn points and less timing-
based puzzles could have made
Unravel a truly exceptional game.
Unravel is out now on PS4, Xbox
One and PC
