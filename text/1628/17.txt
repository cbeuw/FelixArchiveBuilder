ost would not expect
the last painter of the
grand style to be one
of the first modern
artists, and so it is quite daring and
unique for an exhibition to make
such a statement. Delacroix and the
Rise of Modern Art sheds light on
Delacroix’s overlooked role as being
an early modern revolutionary in
both his individual style and the
influence he had on succeeding
modern masters.
The show opens with Cezanne’s
statement – “We all paint in
Delacroix’s language”. In each room,
some of Delacroix’s paintings are
displayed alongside a painting
by another artist which directly
mimic or incorporate certain
elements from that specific work of
Delacroix’s. This layout exposes his
influence and shows that this “we”
in Cezanne’s statement includes
Renoir, Van Gogh, Monet, Manet,
Matisse, Kandinsky, as well as
countless others.
Delacroix’s works themselves
reflect his rebellious vision of
liberating colour and technique
from traditional rules, unafraid
of official opposition with which
many of his paintings were met.
His controversial The Death of
Sardanapalus (the small version
is displayed in Room one) , for
example, when first shown at
the Salon, was condemned for
bizarreness, violence, and sexuality
(curiously, in our times these

surprise, really). Delacroix’s
innovative composition in this
painting was, however, impressive
and influential to the modernists, as
we see the composition of the figures
mirrored in Cezanne’s The Eternal
Feminine shown alongside the work.
Arguably, Delacroix’s determination
to “express passion as clearly as
possible”, as Baudelaire said, and
rebel against traditions inspired the
following generations of modernists
to push creative boundaries.
Even though most of the works by
Delacroix displayed in the exhibition
have religious, mythological, and
literary themes – subjects of grand
tradition and unseen in works by
the Impressionists – he was chiefly
attracted by these subjects in

express”. His habit of painting a
scene to express and convey feeling
rather than an objective narrative
was a key reference point for
Impressionists.
We see Delacroix’s influence on
the Impressionists particularly in
Room four. He pointed out that
“even when we look at nature, our
imagination constructs the picture”
and true to this belief, Delacroix
expressed the emotions felt before
nature through subjective use
of colour and form. This offered
a precedent for a new type of
landscape painting taken up by the
Impressionists, who expressed the
personal experience and sensations
evoked in the artist by nature
through their paintings.

This
reaffirms
his role in
modern art
In Room three are Delacroix’s
surprisingly bold flower paintings,
a relatively underrated part of his
oeuvre. They are a contrast to his
mythological and oriental themes
dominating the previous two
rooms.. He painted flowers as a way
to show mastery of colour, and they
were some of the earliest examples
of the revolutionary movement “art
for art’s sake”; painting for sake of
painting, for aesthetic joy of artist
and audience.
Over all in Delacroix’s works
in this exhibition, including ones
influenced by mythology and
orientalism, his color scheme is
very similar to that of the avant-
garde works. His omnipresent and
persistent palette of bright bold navy,
red, yellow, and black immediately
brings to mind the palette of
Malevich’s Suprematism paintings.
Delacroix himself said, “I dislike
reasonable painting” – a statement
resonant of an abstractionist’s
motto, isn’t it?
The last room seems to reaffirm
Delacroix’s central role in
development of modern art. There
is just one small painting by him in
this room,alongside several works by
Matisse and a work by Kandinsky –
both prominent figures of the early
20th
century modern art world. This
room implies Delacroix’s lasting
legacy, and it’s a shame that it ends
so early in the art history timeline!
It would be even more curious to
see Delacroix’s influences on later
modern artists such as Picasso.
The show’s punchline is Fantin-
Latour’s Immortality, where
a winged figure representing
immortality showers roses towards
the greenery of a park above
which the name “Delacroix” faintly
hovers. This is almost too blunt an
expression of the show’s theme of
Delacroix’s enduring legacy when it
has already succeeded in subtly and
artfully expressing its title in various
ways throughout each of the rooms.
Perhaps it is not only the influence
of his revolutionary use of colour
and form to express feelings that
lives on in modern art, but also
the central idea for painting that
he expressed in the last line of his
personal journal – “The first merit of
painting is to be a feast for the eyes.”

Art is at the National Gallery,

A trippy look at first-time parenthood
I
read Nina Segal’s script for
in “In the Night Time” in a
mad, streaming rush, coffee on
fingertips on pages in the dregs
of whisky and sleep. It deserved
every one of my 5am minutes, and
more.
“At this very moment, the universe
itself is leaving us behind. Receding.
Walking away and
not even waving goodbye...”
It’s a play in the sense that “The
Odyssey” could have a script.
Comingawayfromtheperformance,
the words, still, are largest on stage.
Actors are mannequins, but Segal’s
work grips them tight, the helpless
carriers for her ideas that they are.
“Perhaps, in a play crying out at a
world that is
hard and
loud and
vast and
brittle and
more, just more,
than we could ever hope to know or
understand”
That’s the point.
Director Ben Kidd has been brave
enough to work subtly here and let
the script do the talking. His focus
is on the minimalism of the staging
– including the eerie neon glow
of the ‘precious child’ (or a plastic
doll with broken legs). Chaos spills
across the stage in the wink of a dog
and a lion with a thorn in it’s paw.
Like all good children’s stories, the
grown-up jokes are in the sidelines,
but the play leaps for them.
It suffers only in that the pitch is
hard to maintain. Once the tide’s
in and the big bad world has burst
through the window how do you
stop it pouring out? At points the
play verges on manic – and that’s
undoubtedly the point – but the
audience is, maybe, drowned just a
hint too quickly to register the full
force of the flood.
Gate has pulled out the stops on
this – some of the most thought
provoking theatre I’ve seen in a
while. And c’mon IC – it’s on your
doorstep for £7.50. What more
could you want?
If you’re particularly keen, check
out my interview with director Ben
Kidd in last week’s FELIX.
In the Night Time is at the Gate
Theatre until the 27th
of February
