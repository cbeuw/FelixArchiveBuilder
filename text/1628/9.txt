The top three
actor-musicians
who aren’t
Madonna
C
onsidering my age it’s
hard for me imagine that,
at one time, Madonna
was the biggest star in
the world. Unfortunately though,
often with a great music career
comes a terrible film career. Anyone
who’s seen Swept Away or The
Next Best Thing should know that
she’s never set the bar high for
musicians-turned-actors. For ease
of list-making I’ve excluded artists
from the 50s and 60s because
starring in shitty films seemed to be
a requirement in those times (here’s
looking at you Elvis):
Beyoncé Knowles
Long before she was dominating
the Super Bowl half-time show
and releasing music videos
which warrant short-film status
themselves, Beyoncé was a budding
film star. The leading role most
people now remember Queen Bey
for is her portrayal of Deena Jones
in the utterly fabulous Dream Girls.
One thing you guarantee when you
cast Beyoncé is a cracking tie-in
single and Dream Girls’‘Listen’is no
exception.
Yasiin Bey (Mos Def)
I’ve admitted my enjoyment of
several films in this section that
should get my film-writer badge
torn from my metaphorical jacket.
One that should get a lot of nerd
blood boiling is my love for the
Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy film –
this is coming from someone who’s
read the entire book series. Bey’s
Ford Prefect was easily the best
part of this film, and the rapper has
also stolen scenes in many others,
including The Italian Job remake.
Justin Timberlake
Considering his superstar status,
Justin Timberlake’s movie career
success came as little surprise.
Timberlake has now starred in
several features from Rom-Coms
(to be expected) to serious dramas.
Admittedly, one need only watch
Black Snake Moan to know he’s
no DeNiro, but the charisma that
made him so successful in music
also lends something special to his
films. Special shout out to The Social
Network.

Equality at the Oscars?
Ahead of the Academy Awards this weekend, we ask whether or
not it’s time to pull the plug on gender-segregated acting awards, in
favour of a gender-neutral accolade
T
he year that saw the
first Academy Awards,
1929, also saw two
landmarks in the march
for equality: in the UK, the 1929
election was the first one in which
women under 30 could vote, leading
to it being termed the ‘Flapper
Election’; and in Canada, five
women led a campaign to change
the legislature to recognise women
as ‘persons’, meaning they could
stand for any role in government.
In the nine decades since, we have
seen revolutionary strides in sexual
equality, and yet Hollywood awards
remain a region of segregation:
when the Academy Awards are
broadcast, the acting categories will
still be split along gender lines, as
they have been since their inception.
So why is this? It could be argued
that early on in the days of the
film industry, women were rarely
afforded interesting parts, and that
Steinem said: ‘it’s not like upper
body strength’ – acting requires
skill and hard work, and this is
independent of the individual’s
gender. To continue to portray
women actors as ‘separate but equal’
really isn’t true equality.
Furthermore, having a single
acting award could set a precedent
for the industry: where the
Academy goes, the industry follows,
and by breaking down gender lines a
powerful message could be sent out
to studio heads.The gender pay-gap
in Hollywood has – rightly – been in
the news in the last couple of years.
From Frances McDormand talking
about how she has only been paid
her going rate once in her career,
to Jennifer Lawrence and Amy
Adams being paid significantly
less than their male co-stars in
American Hustle, gender equality is
becoming a driving force in shaping
the industry. Adopting a gender-
the decision to separate out actors
for awards ensures that at least two
women will win an Oscar every year.
Conversely, nowadays it is acting
where men and women are most
equal in the industry: last year only
6 non-acting awards were given to
women, out of 19; there has never
been a woman nominated for Best
Cinematographer; and Kathryn
Bigelow remains the only woman
to win the Best Director award.
Should we have separate gender
categories for these awards too?
While I do agree that there
needs to be a lot more done to
encourage women across all areas in
Hollywood, I don’t feel like having
acting awards divided by gender is
the best way to recognise women
actors working today; all it does is
place them in a category of their
own, furthering the idea that their
work is inherently ‘different’ to the
‘serious’ work of men. As Gloria

The Smuggler
Dir: Angus Sampson, Tony

aking a film about
bowel movements is
a tough sell. But that
hasn’t stopped Tony
Mahony and Angus Simpson, the
directorial duo behind Australian
crime drama The Smuggler, who
approach the topic with great vision,
but a lack of even-handedness. Set
against the backdrop of the 1983
America’s Cup, which saw an
Australian yachting team breaking
American dominance of the race,
The Smuggler tells the tale of Ray
Jenkins (Tony Mahony), a young
man from the back end of nowhere
who spends most of his time
repairing televisions, being looked
after by his mother, and playing
football in his local amateur team.
A trip to Thailand for the team is
funded by shadowy small-town
crime boss Pat (John Noble),
and Ray is convinced to smuggle
heroin back across the border in
his stomach, in order to help out
Angus Simpson as Ray, in the somewhat confused film The Smuggler. Photo Credit: The Smuggler PR
with his parents’ financial troubles.
However, he is stopped at the last
minute by customs, and detained
in a hotel, where – rather than face
criminal charges – he opts to try
and hold his bowels for the next ten
days, at the ire of police agent Croft
(Hugo Weaving).
On the surface, this film all about
shitting could easily turn out to be,
well…shit. And the promotional
material doesn’t help either –
showing Mahony bending over, it
seems to promise some kind of high-
jinks caper centred around laxatives
and defecation. But actually The
Smuggler is more than that, with
a variety of different moods and
themes explored. At some points
attempts at humour are made, but
on the whole this is an incredibly
bleak film, more in keeping with
social realist dramas than black
comedies. Ray seems a little simple,
ripe for exploitation, and protests
as the pellets of heroin are forced
down his throat; he is regularly
abused by the police chiefs in charge
of him, who make him endure
scalding showers; his dad, buckling
under pressure, starts drinking,
and verbally abuses his wife before
meeting an untimely fate; his own
mother tries to slip him laxatives in
order to get him arrested. At times
it’s unclear whether I’m watching a
humorous exploration of Australian
masculinity, or a Shane Meadows
film.
Elsewhere, Mahony and Simpson
seem to have taken a cue from
David Lynch: one scene is eerily
reminiscent of the famously
disturbing karaoke scene in Blue
Velvet, where Dean Stockwell sings
along to Roy Orbison – only this
time it’s crime boss Pat crooning
at the funeral of Ray’s best friend,
murdered by the police; elsewhere,
Ray’s inner turmoil (both mental
and gastrointestinal) is represented
by a series of malarial fever dreams,
which drip with Lynchian sweat.
Scenes like this are excellent,
but the issue is that Mahony and
Simpson don’t seem to know what
they’re making: is it a dark satire
on Australian competitiveness,
with the America’s Cup serving
as a metaphor for trying to keep
up in a changing world? Or is it
a social drama, where young men
from working class towns are kept
stuck in a world of petty crime and
police brutality? Whatever it is, it’s
certainly far from shit – with a bit
more of a unified vision, Mahony
and Simpson could have had an
excellent film.Even though it doesn’t
reach those heights, The Smuggler is
far better than its scatilogical matter
may suggest.

neutral acting award could show the
Academy recognises – and values –
women’s work the same as men’s.
And if an appeal to equality doesn’t
reach you, what about just a appeal
to quality? Now, we know that, by
and large, the Academy Awards are
meaningless. Meaningless both in
the ‘what about Syria?’ sense of the
wider world, but also within film
as an art form; brilliant films don’t
get awarded anything, and the vast
number of bad films that get awards
(1994: Forrest Gump, 2002: Chicago,
2005: Crash) indicate that Academy
Awards are not about artistic
merit. But this problem is more
pronounced in the acting category.
Let’s consider this year’s nominees:
Leonardo DiCaprio will probably
take home the Oscar for his
portrayal of Hugh Glass, a role that
does not reveal any ability to convey
complex emotions or nuance;
instead, it’s another example of
how voters love seeing actors suffer
on screen (Hollywood sure is a
sadistic industry). But then perhaps
he deserves the award, since it’s
definitely an absolutely stinking
year: Eddie Redmayne layered on so
many simpering affectations as Lili
Elbe that I’m not sure whether the
portrayal is offensive to just the trans
community, or women in general;
Bryan Cranston similarly conjured
up a number of tics in order to
play Dalton Trumbo, in a role that
could be best described as ‘pained’;
and Matt Damon was amusing, but
not much else, in humdrum The
Martian.
But if we turn to the Best
Actress nominees, it’s a different
story. Jennifer Lawrence, easily
the worst of the bunch, still packs
in more emotional range than
DiCaprio. Saoirse Ronan is equally
captivating in her role as Irish shop-
girl Eilis, imbuing her with a deep
vulnerability that hardens into an
inner strength. Charlotte Rampling
delivers a performance that would
be award-worthy just for what she
brings to the ending alone: a shot
that will haunt your dreams and
linger in your mind. Brie Larson,
the likely winner, is a magician on
screen, as the traumatised abuse
victim of Room who must hold
it together for her child. And, of
course,Cate Blanchett is completely
phenomenal as the complex,
controlled Carol Aird, in Todd
Haynes’ sumptuous masterpiece
Carol.
It seems unfair that, if Laron and
DiCaprio win the awards, Ronan,
Blanchet, Rampling, and Lawrence
will all leave empty-handed,
despite putting in barnstormers of
performances. By splitting the role
along gender lines, it increases the
chance that any particular year will
assemble a shortlist of bad apples,
meaning the meaning of winning
is cheapened. Now, imagine if
instead, we had a group of 8 actors,
of all genders, competing for a
single award; that way we’d be more
assured that whoever won would
represent the pinnacle of that year’s
acting.
Ultimately, the continued
existence of separate acting awards
is a mystery for me. By continuing
to split along gender lines, the
Academy sends out a message
that men and women are separate,
while simultaneously lessening
what winning an Oscar means. Not
only that, but abolishing gender
lines would make the ceremony
considerably shorter, and – as
anyone who has stayed up to watch
the Oscars will tell you – that would
be like manna from heaven.
