It has to be Hinds

TogethertheyareHinds,
a Spanish band on the cutting edge
of the garage rock scene in Madrid
with a debut album poised to break
them out further still. Formed in
the summer of 2011 by Ana and
Carlotta (the vocalists and guitarists
of the quartet), the two went under
the moniker of ‘Deers’ until a legal
dispute made them change their
name, but not before they added
bassist Ade and drummer Amber.
2014 was when the band started
to gain traction outside of their
Spanish sphere after the release
of their two singles, ‘Demo’ and
‘Barn’, prompted European and US
tours and slots at Glastonbury and
Benicàssim.
The culmination of this rise is
their debut album, Leave Me Alone
which was released in January to
a smattering of critical acclaim
and embodies a carefree, youthful
summer vibe without losing sight
of their garage rock roots. The
themes that run through the record
largely focus on love, romance and
breakups, all set to a backdrop of
long summer nights in a flurry of
2/3 minute bursts of passion.

complex but the raw emotion shines

through, notably in the call and
response which Perrote and Cosials
often engage in,leading into a flurry
of lyrics and guitar riffs. The lyrics
themselves are also a standout point
with them being written in a second
language, a kind of warped and
twisted English. This gives rise to
odd and quirky lyrics, adding to the
whole craze of the songs.
The opening track, ‘Garden’, is
slowly before building to a crescendo
of jangly guitars and vocal outbursts
by Ana and Carlotta, by which time
you can’t help feel pumped up and
passionate towards their cause.
What follows is the craziest
song on the album, ‘Castigadas en
el Granero’ (roughly translated to
‘Grounded in the Barn’). A blend of
mad lyrics are present (“all I see is a
big cow / and now I’m eating all your
corn)”but are hardly recognisable in
the frenzy which ensues. It feels like
you should be dancing around like
nobody’s watching by the end of it,
and this is neatly followed by ‘Solar
Gap’, a twinkly guitar instrumental
echoing the hazy end to a party.
This soothing mood leads back
into the second half of the album,
with themes staying around the
trials and tribulations of young love.
“I am flirting with this guy, just to
pretend I’m fine” gives off a vibe of
passive aggressive backstabbing at a
former flame, akin to staring across
a room and toying with them.
‘Bamboo’, along with ‘Castigadas
en el Granero’, is a throwback to the
band’s first released material and yet
again captures a snappy outburst of
love, swiftly followed by the slowed
down and beautiful ‘And I Will
Send Your Flowers Back’. Taking
it down a notch gives a feeling
similar to a long summer night,
twinged with the sadness of letting
go. “Space, what a fucked up mess”
is the motto which runs throughout
and the style which Hinds seem
to run with, that of peaking with
a passionate, heartfelt message is
again present.
The final two tracks on the album,
“I’ll Be Your Man” and “Walking
Home”, are reconciliatory tunes,
with the former fitting in the same
calming vibe as ‘And I Will Send
Your Flowers Back’, leading nicely
into the closing track which returns
to the upbeat roots that opened the
album up.
The crazed lyrics also are present
again, “You’re the rice of my bowl”
being a particular favourite outburst
(and also a rejected Valentine’s Day
card slogan). The album ends on a
cliffhanger,fading“You’re the love of
my life” quietly to silence, mirroring
The band performed at KOKO
in Camden last Thursday, to their
largest headline crowd to date and
their ninth sell out show in London.
The band were initially taken aback
by the reception from the audience,
and it took them a couple of songs
to overcome emotions and settle
fully into their groove. When
they did however, they played
with a youthful exuberance that
the recorded version just couldn’t
capture.
The songs were bolstered by
the atmosphere and vice versa,
generating a performance which
while not the most technically
accurate was bursting with fun. The
crowdjoinedinwiththeoutpourings
of love,lust and longing,and danced
along in the spirit of it all.Rounding
off this carefree, adolescent mood
was an encore in which the girls
invited their friends onto the stage,
to dance around to a cover of ‘Davy
Crockett’ like one big party.
All in all the polished sound of the
album dampens the rawness of the
group, a key factor in what stands
them apart from the rest of the
crowd. They’re not manufactured
pop clichés,they’ve bottled an actual
feeling, a whirlwind summer filled
with all the emotions that young
love provides. It’s hard to capture an
instant but in this case Hinds have
made huge strides towards it; it’s
not perfect but it now remains to be
seen whether they can do it again
even better.

initially an upbeat and punchy song,
transforming into an impassioned,
almost love drunk plea to a distant
lover of “give me the keys and I’ll
show you how to fight for more”
and sets the tone for the remainder
of the album, described by the band
as “the 12 faces of love [they’ve]
experienced”.
Leave Me Alone then works its
way through ‘Fat Calmed Kiddos’,
a bizarre title encompassing
another passionate breakup ballad,
and onto ‘Warts’ and ‘Easy’. Both
follow similar themes, of jealousy
and breakups, as well as starting off

O
ver the past decade,
London has lost over
forty percent of its
small music venues,
and it is a similar story around the
country. Notorious venues such
as the Sheffield Boardwalk have
already closed, which saw greats
such as The Clash, Sex Pistols,
and Arctic Monkeys play there at
the beginning of their respective
careers. Many more small venues
are at a risk of shutting down, like
the 100 Club on Oxford Street and
the Troubadour on Old Brompton
Road, which has gone up for sale.
The alarming rate of these closures
is down to a combination of reasons:
increasing rent prices, ridiculously
harsh licensing scrutiny, and the
pressure of building more housing
leading property developers to raise
blocks of flats next to these clubs.
This will inevitably cause more
noise-abatement notices to be filed
costing the venues thousands of
pounds to contest.
To preserve the cultural value
that these institutions bring to the
British music scene,something must
be done. The UK music industry is
currently valued at £3.5 billion and
is mainly based on the small venue
gig here at Imperial. Without these
grassroots venues the British music
industry is simply not sustainable.
It is not only artists that need
these institutions to help their
careers. Small music venues provide
hundreds of thousands of jobs for
bar staff and technicians amongst
others.They, too, use these venues as
opportunities to hone their talents
and improve their career prospects.
In all professions you will have to
start at the bottom, no one starts
off playing Wembley or being a
lighting engineer at the O2.
However, as much as it is about
the live music, it is also about the
role they play in the society. Small
venues have played host to activism
and good for the surrounding
community. They have a heart,
a soul and a connection to their
community. These venues are a
meeting place for people with ideas,
diversity and a non-conformist
attitude. It is imperative to hold
onto passion, culture, art and fun
times, to fight for what makes our
community ours. One of the many clubs at risk of shutting down. Photo Credit: 100 Club
circuit, the lifeblood of the music
scene.There are of course the big O2
arena and stadium gigs that rake in
millions, but without a platform to
showcase their talents and tune their
skills, there will be no musicians to
fill their shoes in twenty years time.

A foot-thumping foray into modern jazz

G
oGo Penguin are
a Mercury Prize
nominated jazz trio
who are lumped into the
increasingly broad genre of modern
jazz; a genre best separated from
its predecessors by an unashamed
turned their backs to the extended
solos and virtuoso flourishes
which often repel people from
traditional jazz releases. The album
instead barrels along with funky
instrumentation and stringently
controlled improvisation to provide
music which is more at home in
a club than a jazz bar. Songs like
‘Smarra’ and ‘Quiet Mind’ have a
dance music aesthetic similar to that
adopted by Bonobo and other jazz-
inspired producers. The group’s use
of acoustic instrumentation allows
them to create this music with a
strictly organic feel.
The most impressive aspect of
Man Made Object is its ability to
maintain strong melodies with free
percussion. This is best seen on the
opening track ‘All Res’, where a
homely piano loop allows for some
upbeat drum experimentation.
The album’s subtle blending of
genres allows it to break free from
its inspirations. Its instrumentation
lends its style most to the now
defunct Portico Quartet, whose
album Knee Deep in the North Sea
goes painfully unrecognised as a
pioneer in modern jazz music. By
fusing elements of Portico Quartet’s
music with the melodies of jazz-
house producers, GoGo Penguin
have provided a fresh sound which
is more mature than their earlier

acceptance of rhythm. Man Made
Object is a testament to this. The
album’s blend of classical jazz and
modern house music provides
a highly accessible acoustic
soundscape.
The stand-out adjective of the
album is melodic. The trio have
releases.
Man Made Object is not the
most experimental jazz album of
recent times, and this shows in its
numbingly predictable final tracks.
Having said that, the album’s lack
of pretentiousness provides a naïve
beauty rarely found in jazz. The
trio’s meticulous instrumentation
has provided an incredibly pleasing
album which acts as a fantastic
gateway into the world of modern
jazz.
