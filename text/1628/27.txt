This week, you decide to sign
an open letter printed in
FELIX for what you think
is a perfectly innocent pro-
EU campaign. However, it's
actually a veiled attempt by
the IC Euro-sceptics Society
to trick you. You call the
society "disgusting" and stop
their bungee jump.

This week, you realise that
everything you write in the
horoscopes comes true as
Kent students petition to
build a 76m tall statue of
Margaret Thatcher outside
their union bar. Realising
the power you have, you start
write more carefully. The
writer gets a great grad job.
The end.
This week you're the EU,
and people are going round
saying they don't want to
be with you anymore. You
decide you don't want to
be with them anyway, even
though you thought things
had been going well. They
eventually leave, but you tell
all your friends it was mutual.
This week, you huff and you
puff and you blow the RAG
crane down. Metaphorically.
That's right, you're the
Imperial College Health and
Safety Department.
This week you're working
on your manifesto for the
elections. You get a bit
carried away and call yours
the New Manifesto for
the Disenfranchised and
launch it into a national
campaign. However, you're
suspended for using adhesive
promotional materials.
This week, in an attempt to
get picked up by the nationals
again,you leave copies of your
newspaper around pubs next
to the Daily Mail, Guardian
and Times headquarters.
However, when you return
the following day, you find
people have just pulled out
the centrefolds. Same old.
This week, you’re thinking
about running for a Big
Elections position. You then
discover that you’re expected
to make decisions that might
divide student opinion, and
they might tweet stuff at you
like 'DPW sux!!!' at four in
the afternoon. Good grief!
You back out.
This week, you’re Jeb! Bush.
All the men in your family
have been Presidents, so
you try too, even though all
you’ve ever wanted to do is
dance. Eventually you back
out, but it ends with your
father proudly watching you
play the lead in Swan Lake.
This week you’re the new
underground line thingy. No
one’s ever bothered to ask you
what your name is. Rude.
This week you're the Brits,
but like the sick dog you
are, ITV refuses to let you
drift off into the night,
instead pumping you full
of life-extending drugs like
Adele and Rihanna. An
experimental mix of James
Bay and Beiber prove too
much and finally, you're at
peace.
This week, you volunteer to
be the first off the crane in
the doomed RAG bungee
jump. However, the college
was right, and bam, you
slam right into the window
of the SCR, ruining a senior
manager’s lunch.
This week,you're the 15,000th
member of Finance Society,
which means the bankers
now has more engagement
than the union itself. A coup
is staged and Finance now
governs us all. But then all
the stuff that happens in The
Big Short happens here and
we're all fucked.
