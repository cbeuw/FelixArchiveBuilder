The ever-resourceful FELIX photographer went

There are pictures of mechanical beauties too

On Friday of last week, a random sample
of 100 IjC. students were interviewed by a
member of the Felix editorial staff. An exact
copy of the questions asked is reprinted below
together with the results.
Well, well, well, con-
trary to everyone's expec-
tations(!) the Felix opinion
poll has revealed that no-
one knows anything
about anyone least of all
who is standing for Presi-
dent of I.C.U.
This miserable state of
affairs might well have
been guessed at by any-
one who was stupid
enough to go to the "meet-
ing of I.C. students" on
Thursday.
Those of us who did
were subjected to the rath-
er sickening sight of the
two candidates spending
a long time telling us very
little about anything.
Rob Armitage is ap-
pearing to justify last
week's article on the sub-
ject. He is so non-contro-
versial and apolitical that
most people have already
decided to let him run the
Union without their inter-
ference in such a messy
business.
Only one thing can be
said about Adrian Smith.
His speeches quite often
sound reasonable but a
quick glance at his prin-
ted words reveal the fami-
liar phrases. "Capitalist
repression," "Union Au-
tonomy," "support the
workers in their fight
against the state," etc. etc.
ad nauseam.
First impressions are
seldom correct but this
case is an exception. Both
candidates are lack-lustre
and do not deserve to be
President of the Union.
It is with a heavy heart
therefore that I come to
the opinion poll.
The clear message is
that although a large
number know that an
election is due, and would
like to vote in it, most
have said they will ab-
strain or not vote at all.
Some of the more inter-
esting points that come
out are:—
Practically no-one
knows when the election
is. (due to lack of publi-
city which the Hon. Sec.
should see to in the ab-
sence of a publicity offi-
cer).
:—Of those who did
know, a sizeable majority
were going to vote for
Adrian Smith.
Remember this saving
point. If less than twenty-
five per cent vote, a re-
election is necessary!
