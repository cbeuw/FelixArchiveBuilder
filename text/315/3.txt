Everyone in this country is supposedly entitled to
medical treatment when in need. No one can be refused
help, but it is easy to be turned away by the attitude
of the staff.

IAN MACKENZIE ON
the non—UGM the new hall
The attendance at last Thursday's scheduled IC
Union Meeting was very poor. Despite the meeting be-
ing boldly advertised on page 2 of "Felix" and on
half-a-dozen posters around college. It was hoped that
advertising in a WEEKLY "Felix" would cut out the
necessity to produce large amounts of extra bumph,
but it certainly seems that reminding people ON THE
DAY is the only way.
Even allowing for the low turnout of about 200
people (the quorum is 300) the challenge to the quorum
made little or no sense. Such challenges are normally
kept for a time when controversial business is being
discussed and where there is a possibility of a non-
representative outcome. At last Thursday's meeting al-
most all the business was either matters of information
or report or the hustings. The exception was amend-
ments to the NUS motions. The quorum challenge right
at the start thus threatened to waste everyone's time.
Thankfully, most people stayed for the ensuing
"Meeting of IC Students" and heard the Presidential
Hustings (which in fact don't need to be in a Union
Meeting) and from Joy Clancy, ULU President.

Debating lines! IC Debating Society held their first
debate of the year last Tuesday. At the debate a com-
petition was held for the freshman debater of the year.
The motion before the a pot in the Union Bar as

With the accommodation situation getting worse
every year, the urgent need to provide a further hall
of residence is felt by everyone in the college. After
all, we have already got two available sites i.e. an
extension of Linstead Hall towards Weeks, and the site
above the sports centre (Northside). Here, the founda-
tions for the hall are already in place. All that is need-
ed is sufficient money to pay for the building.
NEW HALLS COST MONEY
The problem of finance is serious, as the University
Grants Committee will only entertain a relatively small
subsidy if the cost per student bed is kept below about
£2,000. Over the last year our Hall fees have contained
a levy of 35p per week per room which goes to the
new hall fund. The surplus from the largely student
run Summer Vacation letting scheme, also goes to this
end. Add to this a donation of £150,000 from the
Queensgate trust and the amount still needed is within
the limits of a loan.
Thus the hall is "loan financed" and is just finan-
cially viable at the moment, provided the most eco-
nomic building methods are used to accommodate the
maximum number of students.
With soaring building costs, the need to get plans
formulated and a tender accepted quickly is obvious.
ANOTHER SOUTHSIDE?
The Northside Hall is not intended to be another
Soutbside—far from it. The basic concept which the
Union, pressed for last year, was a system of flatlets,
each containing its own cooking and sitting room areas.
A design has been prepared by the college appointed
architects which we shall be suggesting improvements
to it, bearing in mind that the industrial building
method employed and the lay out of services such as
the lift shaft make major redesign impractical.
OVER 250 PLACES
All in all, the hall should accommodate well over
250 students. A few double rooms are provided which
could be used for married students.
An open meeting to discuss the plans was held last
Friday, but if anyone who missed that and has a
burning desire to contribute, the plans will be in the
Union Office till Wednesday lunchtime.

BIG BROTHER
S WATCHING YOU!
Dear Acting President,
The situation in our Canteen relatinq to queues
and serving RCA students alone is always difficult.
However, due to the forward looking attitude of the
SRC, we have never become selfish and operated a
ban on I.C. students using our Canteen.
It seems that this year the problem is particularly
bad and I am, therefore, writing to appeal to you to
inform your students that they should recognise
our difficulties and abide by the previous agreement
that they should only use our Canteen after 1 p.m.
at lunch time and 6 p.m. in the evening.
There are notices to this effect up at the RCA but
it seems to be ignored by your students. In previous
years, strong demand for an I.C. ban were voiced
at SRCs, alas there is talk of this again. I would,
personally, regret it very much if the SRC here
agreed to such a policy, so it would help me from
that point of view also if you would give some
thought as to the best way of getting your members
to show a little more consideration towards our
situation.
Yours sincerely, '
Bryan Webb,
President R.C.A. S.U.
