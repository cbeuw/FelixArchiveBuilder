FELIX October 24, 1972
M A R T I N
And it came to pass, that on the 19th day of October
in the year of our Lord (bat not mine) nineteen hund-
red and seventy two, there was an unholy convocation
and one hundred and ninety seven pilgrims wended
their way through the deserts of the City and Guilds
College, the swamps of the Royal School of Mines and
the tundra of the Royal College of Science to the
Great Hall of the Imperial College.
Our Lord, the President
(Acting) of the Union
came forth into the Great
Hall unto the assembled
multitudes and he spake
unto them, saying "I de-
clare unto you that this
meeting shalt be declared
open, and I ask the Hon-
orary Secretary to read the
minutes". And it came to
pass that the Honorary
Secretary rose to his feet
amidst cheers from the
exhuberant multitudes,
saying 'Minutes of the
. . ." when a voice from
afar spake loud, orating
"Point of Order, Mr.
Chairman, have you open-
ed the meeting?" And it
came to pass that the
Chairman duly explained
that he had indeed opened
the meeting and, hearing
this, Mr. Gerrard (the
voice from afar, in case
you're lost like me—Ed.)
challenged the quorum.
But alas, there were
only one hundred and
ninety seven gathered and
present. And the almighty
Green Blue Book declared
that insufficient, and called
it 0.68 quora.
So thus it came to pass
that the apostle Martin
came near unto the tower
of Colcutt and received a
vision. And a voice spake
unto him, saying "Why
doest thou not pay a
Union Publicity Officer
by RESULTS?"
So if you wish to earn
£p per person coming to
a Union General Meet-
ing, plus expenses (the
amount being calculated
to the nearest 50 people),
please tell me as soon as
possible!!

Further Parking Stickers have been allocated as follows. They
may be collected from the Union Office on production of a Col-
lege Registration and Union card and the car's Log book or
insurance certificate.
