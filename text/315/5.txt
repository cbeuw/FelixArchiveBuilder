The third instalment of our romantic serial by ANGELA DELA-
COURT.
The story so far:—
Trying to forget a broken engagement, JANICE TRENT accepts a job as
an au pair in Rome. Her employer is CARLOS FRANCETTI. a rich Italian
businessman. At a party, Janice meets J O H N LIVINGSTONE, a young Eng-
lish doctor, and NICO, Carlos' younger brother, for whom she feels a strong
attraction. However, it soon becomes clear that Nico is infatuated with
LUISA, his brother's cold but beautiful wife.
MARIO BOTTICELLI, one of the guests, becomes hysterical and tries
to attack Janice. John tells her that Mario was once Carlos' mistress, but
is now engaged to Luisa's brother ANGELO. Janice is disturbed by an over-
heard conversation which seems to hint that John and Luisa are having an
affair.
Next day, Carlos offers to show Janice the sights of Rome. Surprised
and flattered, she accepts.
N O W READ ON . . . .
The afternoon was hot
and dusty, the streets
almost empty, for it was
siesta time. We spoke
very little; I stood still in
awe of Carlos, for he
was, after all, my em-
ployer, although I would
not deny that he was
also a very attractive
man. If only it had been
Nico, I thought with
longing . . . .
We wandered through
deserted back streets to-
wards the Bridge of
Sighs. I was captivated
by the atmosphere, the
timeless spell of Rome.
Breaking a long si-
lence, he asked me
gently, "Why did you
come to Rome? Were
you unhappy in Eng-
land?"
I glanced up quickly,
meeting the gaze of
those deep brown eyes
which seemed to know
so much about me. I
was surprised by his
sympathy and under-
standing. But how could
I tell him about Bill, who
had meant so much to
me, and my fatal attrac-
tion for thou that had
ruined our chance of
happiness?
"I now get looks from boys
who are passing by in the street I"
says Jean Scully of Liverpool.
"I had terrible problems with my acne
and pimples. I never had any boyfriends.
I tried everything. Then I discovered
Jermokua. As you can see from the
photo. I now have no problems at all!"
Draw your own conclusions —
JERMOKUA
"the instant answer!
"Unhappy?" I said,
hoping he would not
notice my tone of false
gaiety. "Why should I
be? I was bored, that
is all".
In spite of my efforts,
I found myself growing
more and more attracted
to Carlos. Could there
be any truth in the dark
rumours which sur-
rounded him? I remem-
bered what Lucia had
said that night. But
somehow, I could not be-
lieve that Carlos, who
seemed so kind and
gentle, would have
stooped to such beha-
viour. I decided to con-
sult Francesca as soon
as possible. Meanwhile,
I must try to keep my
feelings in check.
Carlos' voice interrup-
ted my reveries. Lean-
ing on the parapet, he
smiled at me. "Have you
ever seen the Seine by
moonlight?" I shook my
head. "Everybody in
love should. You must
allow me to show it to
you". His eyes held
mine, and I felt a slow
blush steal over my face.
"I'd like that", I
stammered.
His hand touched
mine. "Carissima", he
whispered. "It is a long
time since I have felt
like this about anyone,
but already — I think I
love you. You are . . .
how you say? . . sym-
pathetique?"
And suddenly we
found ourselves in each
other's arms. I melted
into his passionate em-
brace, but as his lips
met mine it was Nico I
thought of. My mind
was in a turmoil. What
had become of all my
resolves to avoid emo-
tional entanglements?
Already London, Bill,
and the quarrel with
Seth seemed a million
miles away. Would I
ever be free to live my
own life with the one
man I loved?
Then I noticed a fa-
miliar figure on the
other side of the water.
As he approached, I
recognised it as Angelo.
His eyes met mine in a
look of shocked incom-
prehension. My heart
beat faster. How would
I explain this to Luigi?

Soggy leaves come floating down.
Upon the streets of London Town.
Causing many to complain.
That winter has begun again.
But why the need to sit and mope?
In life there always is some hope.
That spring will follow sometime soon.
And reward the patient with a boon.
Therefore we should cry out with glee,
"There's nothing like a cup of tea!"
