PAPER MEDIA
Since I was last at I.C., over a year ago, the com-
munications media does not appear to have in-
dulged itself in any great climaxes of imagination.
The same basic outlets existed ranging up from
the constituent college sheets via Felix to UL's
Sennet plus CEFE and IC Newsletter. Of these one
has visibly improved and two, RCS Broadsheet and
Mines Newsletter, probably have since I haven't
seen a copy of either yet and they couldn't get any
further into the literary depths they were ripping off
at the time.
Broadsheet was com-
posing its morose mix-
ture of Private Eye re-
gurgitations, lefty witch-
hunts, jokes you'd seen
before somewhere else
and worse, some they'd
thought of themselves.
Mines Newsletter had
the odd sports report but
otherwise was preoccu-
pied with the dubious
hang-up of counting pints
of Tartan drunk by its
own boring clique.
Guildsheet, too, had its
fair quota of egotripping
simplicity and esoteric
banality but its contribu-
tors were more numer-
ous and various and it
'did shoot the gaff off the
mouldy yogourt scandal
a week before the Sun-
day Times, albeit on a
low and local level
(Mooney). Mooney
really did believe that
the date on the lid was
when they were made—
while everyone else's
were showing two weeks
to go, Mooney's were
three weeks post-dated
and in a comparable
state to the rest of his
mouth-waterina bacteria.
Felix, with few excep-
tions, had little to purr
about and seems to have
evolved no further
(though, from reading
here, does uphold free-
dom of expression). It
only appeared every fort-

night at the most then
but was a bit more char-
ismatic than today's
issues if only due to that
nice pink paper it was
printed on. Sennet, its
counterpart from UL was
at that time edited by
the illustrious, legendary
figure of Piers Corbyn
and, while overstating
its case and often en-
thusing into the barren
world of futile aspira-
tion, did achieve a de-
gree of healthy contro-
versy and lively cross-
talk sadly lacking around
today's spread of media.
CEFE was around,
too, but it quickly lost
the art of communica-
tion and succeeded in
talking only to itself and
at everyone else. There
are subtler ways of put-
ting over a point or may-
be it's the readers. I
don't know. The one
miserable improvement
to me is the IC News-
letter which, besides its
chronology of events
pending, now carries
short articles of hopeful
interest in excess of the
who's died, who's got
the OBE touch of old.
The articles are under-
standably a bit college
establishment and often
read like the message
from the managing direc-
tor of Heathco's but they
keep you in touch.
About the only other
reading media about the
place was the Worker's
Press, which tried to put
the other side to the
news but often dropped
off the creditability pla-
teau, and the predomin-
antly anal offerings of
the National press.
One final thought.
Why do Hall subwar-
dens believe that all
their happy campers read
is the Daily Telegraph?
Perhaps it's to ensure
all the papers don't get
nicked. They may run
out of that lovely soft
sandpaper in the bogs,
after all.
