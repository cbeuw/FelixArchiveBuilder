COUNCIL ON THE
BLOCK
Council guillotined itself
for the first time at its
meeting on Monday week.
In future all councils will
get the chop at 1
1 o'clock,
instead of carrying on to
all hours of the morning as
has previously been the
case. In fact, much of
Council's business was
concerned with itself, since
it also granted itself a half-
hour break in the middle
of meetings and re-instated
Council teas (something
that was abolished in a
spate of penny-pinching at
the last council of last
year).
Besides these monumen-
tal decisions, the only mat-
ter other than pure rou-
tine that was discussed
was that of the new hall,
and there was precious
little conversation about
that, since most people
had left by the time it
came around.
The only reason that
council managed to spread
out its business to last
until 10.44 was because of
the enormous amount of
time wasted by certain
council members who be-
trayed their extreme nai-
vete by asking the most
stupid and irrelevant ques-
tions and by treating
points O
f information as
items worthy of hours of
discussion. For example,
when Rob Armitage men-
tioned a list of union-
registered coach operators
and suggested that, if it
was decided to change
companies in the future,
that the list should be con-
sulted, it developed into
thirty minutes' discussion
. . . and ended up where
they began, maintaining
the status quo.

PRESIDENT
SELF-ELECT?
Whilst all these merry
capers were going on at
IC Council, Master Armit-
age had winged his way to
ULU for the SRC (Stu-
dents' Representative
Council) meeting there.
Our SRC scout reports
that, the elections for reps
to various Senate commit-
tees having come around,
our Rob stood up to pro-
pose the ICU President for
the Committee.
"But", said Rob, "we
haven't got one yet".
"What you mean", replied
Joy Clancy, president of
ULU, "is that you want to
propose Rob Armitage for
the Committee". Rather
premature, perhaps. Never-
theless, Rob got elected.
He has since been seen
asking amongst others the
Ed of "Felix" what the
Committee
does.

SOMETHINGS OUT
The almost - forgotten
"Something" has once
again raised its head, cele-
brating its first issue of
the year with a take-off of
"Feelsick" (oops, sorry,
time for another Ed's com-
ment, I meant "Felix"—
Ed.). The Ed of "Felix"
has been heard to say that
he wishes "Felix" were as
good! Although in theory
a SocSoc publication, there
is precious little if any
political dogma contained
in this Broadsheet-type
publication, and seems to
be mainly a satirical mag.
Fortunately for us, it
doesn't just take off
"Felix", but has digs at
everyone else in college
too. There are well-sub-
stantiated rumours that at
least one high-ranking
member of the Union hier-
archy is scared stiff of
Something, or rather "is
concerned about this in-
crease in the amount of
bumph floating around
college, which is exactly
what we were trying to re-
duce". It is purely coinci-
dental that this particular
person is the subject of
rather a lot of criticism in
Something.
Anything that adds a
touch of cheer to the
scene at IC is to be wel-
comed . . . but next time,
please, why not take off
"IC News" or a broad-
sheet???
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
THE SAGA OF NORMAN AND HIS
PROBLEM SHEETS
"I'm very confused."
"Why's that, Norman?" I said.
"Well, I picked up this duplicated sheet — I thought it
was a problem sheet, actually—and it didn't make
sense."
"Problem sheets seldom do," I said.
"Yes, but I don't think this is one—look."
"It looks like an election leaflet, Norman, endorsing one
of the candidates for President of the Union."
"Oh! Well if it's about a union I'm not interested in that
sort of thing. Anyway, I can't see how he can hope to
get votes if he goes around saying everyone at
Imperial is a pig."
"I wouldn't think so, either, Norman. Where does he
say that?"
"Here—look."
"Oh, Norm. Don't be silly. An imperialist isn't someone
at IC, It's a description of the Western society."
"Well, what's something like that doing in a college
leaflet? I can't see what it's got to do with an elec-
tion here."
"He believes that you can't isolate the college and the
whole university system from the rest of society. In
the same way you do other things besides your lecture
course."
"I don't know about that. At least when I'm isolated I
can get on with my problem sheets in peace. See,
they've made me do some non-technical subjects and
I've got a lot of books to read so I've no time for
anything else."
"But don't you go to any other lectures and discussions
besides those you're told to, Norman?"
"Well, mother said go and see Mrs. Whitehouse the other
day and she seemed to think we should all be getting
on with our studies, She was a real gas, I thought."
"Bromine," I said. "But don't you read anything else
but what you're told to?"
"Oh, yeS," said Norman. "I get the Daily Telegraph on
Fridays for the colour magazine."
"I like the Smirnoff adverts," I said.
"What's thai?"
"Forget it, Norm. I should get on with your problem
sheets."
"Now—totalitarian—I should think that's the sum of a
geometric progression."
"Yes, Norman."
Ads-Quorum
Sir, — I was deeply up-
set by the attitude of the
Executive of I.C. Union
following my successful
challenge to the quorum
at the meeting on 19th
October. An important
meeting, such as a hust-
ings, is worthless if there
are only 200 people pre-
sent, and yet I found my-
self being insulted and
sneered at by a group of
people who hadn't taken
the trouble to advertise a
meeting properly.
It would appear that so
long as they hand you a
few lines to print in Felix
(or didn't they bother to
do that?), that is all the
advertising that is needed.
Whereas we don't want
everywhere floating in
bumph sheets, I think a
few dye line adverts
wouldn't have gone amiss.
No doubt our sabbaticafl
officers will blame the
poor publicity on the lack
of a publicity officer.
Or perhaps they believ-
ed that the two "popular"
candidates might succeed
in getting everyone along.
Yours sincerely,
W. A. GERRARD
(Metallurgy P.G.)
P.S. Unfortunately, the
hustings that occurred
after the challenge was
perfectly legal according
to the "blue book".
Anonymity
Preserved
Dear Sir, — Without
wishing to elongate the
saga of Lin&tead Bar
Committee (whom I be-
lieve are, incidentally, the
only committee who really
know how to run a bar) I
feel it must be pointed out
to Mr. Rossell that the
prerogative to publish any
literature whether libel-
lous, badly spelt or true,
lies in the artistic sense of
the Editor.
It is an indisputable
human right to produce
literature anonymously,
especially in the case in
question, because the
writer is in danger of petty
victimisation in his home
for the year.
If Mr. Rossell feels
that this argument is his
only defence against the
letter of "the Moderator"
one can only infer that he
must feel guilty (after all
he has been in Hall for a
time exceeding his sub-
wardenship) or that his
riposte was written after
an over-long spell in that
ubiquitous bar.
Perhaps most important
is this question: Should
re-admission to Hall be
allowed while some
people still have to spend
their full 3 years at IC in
some garret in Putney.
Yours faithfully,
THE CHAIRMAN
OF THE COURT OF
HUMAN RIGHTS.
Impartiality
Sir, — As an ordinary
and, I hope, fair-thinking
member of Imperial Col-
lege Union, I would like
to complain most strongly
about an article in the
current issue of your
newspaper (No. 314). I
say YOUR newspaper
when What I really mean
is OUR newspaper.
"Felix" is meant to be an
impartial information
sheet for the benefit of the
members of the Union
with room for Editorial
comment in the Editorial
column. How then do you
reconcile this ideal with
the news item on the front
page of the issue in ques-
tion concerning the forth-
coming presidential elec-
tion. This constituted
nothing more than thinly
disguised propaganda for
Rob Armitage. Whilst Mr.
Armitage may well be the
preferable candidate for
President, this item was
not the place for the edi-
tor to exercise his view on
this. I am sure Mr. Armi-
tage was suitably disgust-
ed with the article and I
hope that in future the
editor will exercise Ms
function in a more efficient
manner in weeding out
this sort of article.
Yours faithfully,
BILL COLLETT,
Maths 3.
Editorial comment: Thank
you for telling me what
"Felix" is meant to be.
Unfortunately, this must
be your own opinion,
since it certainly doesn't
appear in print anywhere.
Editorial comment is re-
stricted to the Editorial
column by precedent only,
and last issue was no ex-
ception. The front page
article was written by a
"Felix" reporter for the
information of members
of IC union — // you con-
sider it biased, that is your
opinion. Try writing an
article on the subject that
ISN'T biased\
Whitehouse
Sir, — The report in
Issue No. 314 on the Gen-
eral Studies lecture by
Mrs. Mary Whitehouse
seems to have completely
missed the main point of
the talk.
It was ten minutes past
two before Mrs. White-
house even touched upon
the topic of pornography
and its association with
politics. The first forty
minutes appear to have
been completely forgotten
in your review.
Mrs. Whitehouse ar-
gued that whereas stu-
dents had been campaign-
ing in past years most
forcefully and successfully
in such fields as student
representation she could
not understand why they
were also not concerned
in the field of public rep-
resentation affecting the
choice of programmes
screened on television.
She appealed to stud-
ents to help correct what
in her view was a serious
misbalance in the presen-
tation of certain topics on
television of which she
gave examples together
with evidence of misbal-
ance.
Since it is the BBC who
select their panel of ad-
visors, the public has little
means by which to put
across its own views
except through organisa-
tions such as the National
Viewers and Listeners As-
sociation.
Mrs. Whitehouse felt
that concern in this field
was especially relevant at
the present time since the
BBC TV charter expires
in 1976. Plans for the fut-
ure of the BBC must be
drawn up in the next two
years, considering also
that television plays an
ever increasing part in the
presentation of ideas and
information to the public.
I hope, Sir, that in fut-
ure the factual contents
of reports on General
Studies lectures will be
more precise and will not
be accompanied by photo-
graphs of a certain strip-
per whose positively re-
volting act a large num-
ber of Guildsmen were
subjected to some 2 years
ago at the Guilds' Review.
Yours faithfully,
ANDREW MAFELD
Thank you!
Sir, — I have just read
last weeks issue of
"Felix". I must congratu-
late you. The standard of
writing, reporting, editing
and the tone of the paper
are much higher than I
can remember seeing in a
student newspaper before.
May I wish you and your
Board success in this en-
terprise.
Yours sincerely,
D. M. HUM
(Senior Tutor,
Maths Dept.)
MyDear
Editor . . .
Sir, — As a Civil En-
gineering P.G., I have
been disillusioned so far
with this years' FELIX.
My criticisms are twofold:
1. The lack of articles
or either quality or quan-
tity. The advertisement on
the back page of the last
issue regarding the "Sir
Arthur Ackland English
Essay Prize" appears rele-
vant to some of your staff
and perhaps to some of
the faceless journalists
writing imaginary articles
in vacant spaces of
"Felix". Paragraph 1
states "the object of the
competition is to encour-
age good writing of Eng-
lish". I think Felix could
do with the practice. One
of the suggested titles is
"An Optimist's Appraisal
of the Future". Think
about it.
2. My second criticism
falls on you, my dear Edi-
tor, for a complete lack of
Editorial control and an
excess of editorial license
(should that be licence,
dear Editor? You of all
people should know) (Yes,
I do — you were right
second try. Ed.)
Why is there no struc-
tural format or layout for
our weekly paper? Did
the headline "Would you
buy a used car from
these men" refer to the
elections or the NUS con-
ference? Take a look, dear
Editor (Don't need to, I
can remember it, Ed.)
Judging by the attendance
at the last IC UGM I
think it could have been
the latter.
Why does the calendar
for the week appear in
print similar to a tele-
phone directory? (it
doesn't — take a look at
a telephone directory,
dear Mr. Jowitt). Don't
tell me, you would like a
"Sabbatical Art Consul-
tant" to help you out.
(Not on your life, Ed.)
I suggest that you trade
your editorial cynicism of
the last few weeks for
editorial control of "your"
paper.
This letter is written by
P. Jowitt, Civ. Eng. PG.,
not ICU Dep Pres, and is
written to the Editor of
"Felix", not Oily Dowson,
Editor of "Felix", or, for
that matter, Oily Dowson,
human being. I hope no-
one construes it as des-
tructive criticism, or a per-
sonality clash.
Yours till the cows
come home.
PAUL JOWITT
Another bit of Editorial
Licence: I shall do every-
thing to encourage the
staff of "Felix" to enter
the Essay Competition.
You never know, I might
do so myself. Your com-
ments about the design as-
pect are quite justified —
the omission of lines to
divide articles and heads
was a printing error, by
the way and was not a
"Felix" design fault to
the best of my knowledge.
"Felix" is to have a new
image anyway from the
21st November issue . . .
but wait and see for that.
Articles of quality, I sup-
pose, disappeared when
you stopped writing for
"Felix". As for quantity,
this issue is overmatter to
the order of 50 per cent,
and much of the schedul-
ed articles to be run in
these pages have had to
be held over.
Welcome to
Mooney
Dear Sir,
As a reciprocal gesture
to RCA not allowing IC
students to use their re-
fectory during normal
hours could not a notice
be posted around IC to
the effect that RCA people
may use Mooney at all
times and, furthermore,
obtain a large discount for
the privilege.
Yours Nourishingly,
Martin Doughty,
(Civ Eng PG).
