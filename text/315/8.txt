RUGBY SAILING TENPIN BOWLING
On Saturday, 14th October, IC 1st XV travelled to
Cheshunt to play their first club side of the season.
The result was again one in favour of IC — 15-9.
Electing to play up the
slope in the first half, IC
began rather slowly.
Cheshunt were almost
constantly attacking but
the IC defence held. A
fresh breeze behind IC
aided them and Cheshunt
were gradually driven
back. However, the first
score was to come from
Cheshunt. After an in-
fringement the Cheshunt
fly half kicked a penally
from close to the posts to
make the score 3-0. This
was how it remained
until half time.
IC turned round With a
fitter and more mobile
pack — the Cheshunt
pack were visibly flaking
in the last 10 minutes of
the 1st half. A long kick
out was fumbled by
Cheshunt and from the
resulting scrum James
dropped a goal from in
front of the posts to make
it 3-3. IC were really on
the boil now, and from a
peel at a line out, prop
Bruce Bradley went
through the Cheshunt de-
fence through a centre
threequarter. After a mag-
nificent 40 yard run, he
found the rest of the IC
pack in support and they
promptly won the ruck
which had formed for the
ball to travel out to the
wing where J. Hunt
scored in the corner —
the try being converted by
D. Rimmer.
Another ruck won by
the dominant IC pack
found Rimmer up in sup-
port with the backs and
he scored wide out — and
also converted his own
try.
Cheshunt came back
into the game with a tra-
velling movement by their
three-quarters. The wing
cross kicked and the
Cheshunt wing forward
scored under the posts. IC
held out for a victory al-
though a noticeable ab-
sentee in this cover
defence was James who
was completely knack-
ered and unfit. He
should get a boot up the
rear so I've heard said.
TEAM: D. Rimmer, J.
Hunt, J. Rose, R. Stern,

DROPPED GOAL: —

On Sunday, 15th Octo-
ber IC played Silver Wing
in the 1st round of the
Middlesex Cup and were
victorious by 21-9. Your
roving reporter ALJ how-
ever was not on hand (I
was otherwise engaged)
but relying on good sour-
ces of information (they'd
better be, ED.) it appears
that the game was very
scrappy, McDonough
scored 3 tries and Dennis
Shakesheff got another.
Silver Wing got a dis-
puted penalty try but IC.
were well satisfied with
their victory. It might be
noted that IC are now
undefeated since last Jan-
uary when they narrowly
lost to Richmond 23-21.
This record could stretch
for quite a few more
games as the team settles
in to play together more
regularly.
SUNDAY'S TEAM: -
D. Rimmer, J. Hunt, J.
Rose, R. Stern, J. McDon-
ough (Capt.), D. Shake-
sheff, C. Flanagan, B.
Bradley, F. Musgrave, K.
Horseman, A. Smith, C.
Humphries, I. Partridge,
R. Matthews, M. Adams.

Our first match was
sailed at Portsmouth. In
the first race D. Law
crewed by Pete Barrett
was put out on a port/
starboard i n c i d e n t
shortly after the start. N.
Charlwood crewed by
John Labard finished
first but was subse-
quently disqualified for
a collision before the
start. B. Rogers finished
third but moved into
second after disqualifica-
tion of the first boat.
After a restart in the
second race we finished
1st (D. Law), 4th (S.
Briscoe) and 5th (J. La-
bard). We put out their
second boat after a pro-
test and their last boat
in a draw on points, but
since we won the last
race we gained the
match.
Also, over the same
weekend, four members
of ICSC, sailing for the
University of London
Sailing Club (Nick, Mar-
tin, Alan Curran, Ed
Hyams and Derek Clark)
took part and won for
the second time the RYA
National Team Racing
Final sponsored by Dun-
hills. This event is of
the highest possible
standard and the team
will now go on to repre-
sent Great Britain in the
World Championships,
probably in Austria.
Finally, ! would like to
congratulate Mark Ros-
kell for being selected to
join the very successful
1st London team and
Pete Barrett for the
second team.
The Imperial College Tenpin Bowling Club had its
first match in the Universities and Colleges Southern
League on Sunday, 15th October against University
College at the Piccadilly Bowl.
The determination of all the teams to win was re-

It should be noted that IC
1st, although playing extremely well, could not gain
a point against the formidable UC 1st team who es-
tablished a UCC club record series of 2618 and record
game of 914. Credit should be given to J. Cantle of
IC lst's who rolled a 544 three game series.
Tenpin Bowling, although regarded by many as, a
minority sport, is well established at Imperial College
and anyone interested in joining should contact G.
Banks 612 Linstead.
MOTOR RACING
Sunday 15th saw City and Guilds Motor Club
at Brentford Market in their first ever invitation
event, against very experienced opposition from
the Cemian Motor Club and Bognor Regis Motor
Club. Anthony Raine (Mech. Eng. 1) in his first
Autotest drove incredibly well in his Triumph Spit-
fire and surprised everyone by taking 2nd place
overall and 1st place in the Sports Car Class. He
scored a total of 245 seconds in the eight tests,
only a few seconds slower than the winner from
Cemian Motor Club, who drove the nearest thing
to a two-wheeled Mini 1275 I've ever seen! Pete
Wilkins (Mech. Eng. 2) also put in a creditable
performance in his ex-G.P.O. van and took 11th
place overall and second in the saloons under
1300c.c. class, with a time of 297 seconds. Jim
Briggs ('61 Anglia with a very insecure airfilter)
and Perry Newton (Escort G.T.) lagged some way
behind in 15th and 16th places respectively.
Many thanks to John Baird, Rhod Palmer and
Pete Cramb for marshalling; Malcolm Newman and
my wife (our only spectators) for watching, and
Cemian Motor Club for the invitation.
