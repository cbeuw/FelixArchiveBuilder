FELIX
J u l i e T i p p e t s has a new album
released this week. She talks to
Ian M o r s e about the musical
direction she has taken since
leaving the rock scene at the
height of her fame.
T H E Y E A R WAS 1968. The band was
the Brian Auger Trinity, and " T h i s
Wheel's on F i r e " had hit the charts
with a bullet! The girl who fronted the
band looked a w i l d , totally emancipated
creature, with a clear, biting tone to her
v o i c e . She had just been voted 'Brightest
Hope' in the Melody Maker p o l l , and
'great things' were being predicted for
her. She was J u l i e D r i s c o l l .
The Trinity at that time were a
hugely popular outfit, e s p e c i a l l y on the
Continent, where ' J o o l s ' was regarded
as something of a cult figure (sic).
Another single followed, " R o a d to
C a i r o " , together with an album " O p e n " ,
and her s u c c e s s seemed guaranteed —
when suddenly, to the great surprise of
the majority, she seemingly just packed
her bags and walked out on the rock
scene altogether. Apart from a brief
encounter with acting, when she portrayed
a hitch-hiking hippie wench in one of
those social comment plays, popular
with the B B C at the time, it was the
last mass media ever heard of the girl.
In 1970, she released an album " 1 9 6 0 " ,
and married pianist/composer Keith
Tippetts, since then J u l i e has been
involved with the British avante-garde/
free music scene.
J u l i e Tippetts and I are chatting in
the office of some big wig at R C A
House. On the w a l l s are splattered
gold and silver d i s c s , most of them
awarded for the work of the Sweet. She
makes me a cup of coffee, but I notice
she's not drinking her's. T h i s makes
me suspicious — after all is not this
the very same female who's witch-like
appearances on Top of the Pops, scared
the d a y l i g h t s out of impressionable
small boys, back in '68? Does she
like people who write about her? Well,
s h e ' s smiling a lot and these days
looks almost angelic, with not a trace
of the facial paint work that epitomized
the late s i x t i e s epoch. I decide to cast
fate to the wind, and start my '20
Questions' routine. So why did you
decide to opt out of the rock scene in
the first place?
"I definitely needed to get out; I
couldn't have carried on with that way
of life, it became unreal. I wanted to
be involved in things that were real
and honest, and I found that I was in
fact living a bit of a - not dishonest
existence, but an unreal one. And I
really had to get out of t h a t " .
" B e f o r e I met Keith I hadn't really
listened that much to people like
Archie Shepp, although I was always
interested in those sort of fields. It
was just a matter of having them sort of
laid on me, you know. Of course
Auge(Brian Auger)was always interested
in jazz and he was always open to
things, so I suppose I was drawn a bit
that way. But then my musical tastes
are pretty broad, that's why I think an
album like 'Sunset G l o w ' (her new
record) — portrays a lot of the things
that I feel m u s i c a l l y , instead of being
in one sort of a r e a " . What of her acting
career? I remember he getting favourable
critical response at the time. Did she
receive offers of other parts?
"I did, but I don't feel drawn towards
acting. It's a matter of channelling
my head somehow or other into one
direction, and music seems to be it.
I've never studied,but then I've never
studied music as such either, but that
seems to be the one that's taken its
course throughout my life, so that's
the one I've to actually stick to.
Anyway, I don't think I've got that
kind of front anymore, to get into
acting, you know. I mean you start
getting involved with acting and you're
acting, and I think that can sort of
rub off on your own life; and I want
to get involved with things that are
natural and h o n e s t . "
It was in 1971 that husband Keith
unleashed into the world his magnum
masterpiece, 'Septober Energy', performed
by the fifty-odd piece Centipede. J u l i e
wrote the l y r i c s , and played with the
outfit on all their too-few gigs. (Incident-
ally there are plans underway to
re-float the musical whale, after a
successful performance in F r a n c e ,
just before Christmas. Mr Tippetts is
at present, busy writing a few short
pieces to be included with ' E n e r g y ' .
By this time the lady was fully engrossed
in the avante-garde, and has been
involved at various stages of Spontaneous
Music E n s e m b l e ' s lifespan, the group
led by altoist, Trevor Watts and
drummer, John Stevens.
In late 1973 J o o l s sang the poetry
of Paul Haines on American composer
Carla B l e y ' s acclaimed work, 'Tropic
A p p e t i t e s ' . How had she come to be
involved in the recording? "It was
Irene Schweitzer (Swiss pianist)
really, she knew C a r l a , and C a r l a said
she needed a v o c a l i s t . Then she wrote
to me and asked if I was interested in
doing it."
How did she feel about the way the
album was produced?
" T h e y weren't finished tapes even —
it was a bit h a r d , " she emphasises.
"I mean, I was originally going to go
over there (America) to do it, but as it
was I learnt the things from tapes that
C a r l a had sent over, and did it like
that. I must admit I havn't played it
that much, I think its turned out a bit
like it actually was recorded — a bit
disjointed, perhaps not as flowing even
as Carla would have wanted it, because
it was done bit by bit, and I don't
feel there was an actual flow about
it. But, that could be because of
myself. I probably would have liked
to have participated a bit more than just
singing the actual parts and songs
as such, so that could be an unfair
criticism of the album, it could be
just from my point of v i e w " .
We talked for a while about the
free music scene in London. Did she
have an opinion on why in this country,
the music had not achieved the media
acceptance it enjoyed on the continent?
" T h e r e doesn't seem to be much
room f
or it really, does there? I don't
know, when you go to places like
Germany and see just what a unity
there is between musicians — it's
crazy that there's not something
happening like that here — there always
seems to be a block put on it. There's
not the outlet on radio for a start,
maybe it's even down to being a small
country. I really don't know, and yet
it's there — it's all there, it just seems
that people don't know where it i s ; '
The new album came about as a
result of her long friendship- with
producer Giorgio Gomelsky, who had
first 'discovered' J u l i e D r i s c o l l singing
in an office while she was secretary of
the Yardbirds fan club, in 1966. He had
recently been getting a new record
label together (Utopia) and asked if she
was interested in doing anything for it.
'Sunset Glow' is the result.
I find the record surprisingly easy
to listen to, compared to say, the
experimental work she has recently
been involved in with S M E . Was this a
conscious attempt on her part to reach
a wider audience?
" N o , it wasn't an attempt to do
anything like that really, other than I
suppose to put together a l l the things
I've learnt m u s i c a l l y , it felt very
