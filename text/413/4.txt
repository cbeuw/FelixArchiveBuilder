Alfs Army amuse royalty
Sir, — May I bring to your
attention the fact that the
remark by Mr Richard Parker
(ICU A A O ) referring to the
' F a c a d e ' , of A l f ' s Imperial
(Pacifist) Army, of "fighting
" h i g h " Christianity and to
the " t r u e m e t a l " yet to be
revealed, was utter nonsense,
based not just on a mis-
understanding, but, apparently,
an ignorance of fact.
• The battle against the
Christian U n i o n , which
occured during the C U
mission week, was organised
at the instigation of the
C U themselves. A l f ' s Imperial
Army (AIA) accused them
henceforth with practicing
low church evangelism after
the mould(!) of B i l l y Graham,
causing the mindless peasant
masses to stray from the
true path of faith according
to C h a r l e s I authorised
version. They disagreed. T h i s
conflict was resolved in
battle (pacifist type) where
the C U showed themselves
to be of the true faith and a
truce was c a l l e d in good
spirit and both waring
parties proclaimed their
united stance in the defence
of the Faith and Propagation
of the Word So much for the
" F a c a d e of fighting " h i g h "
C h r i s t i a n i t y " .
A s for A l f ' s " t a k i n g over
I C U " , may I suggest you
read an excellent article in
F E L I X No 412 by Mr Parker,
in which he shows the IC
can be taken over by anyone
who can get " 2 0 people who
are w i l l i n g to sign a piece of
p a p e r " , said piece of paper
being a nomination for a
place in I C U , supposedly.
And, after a l l , at IC " W e
substitute s e l e c t i o n from a
competent few with proscription
of an unopposed few, so who
needs military take-overs
(pacifist-type)?
Mr Parker a l s o implied
that we are a threat to
democracy in IC. May I
remind you that we have,
on numerous o c c a s i o n s ,
declared our a l l e g i e n c e to
the Crown, our support of
the principles of British
Constitutional Government and
the legally elected Government,
our adherance to the law and
the teachings of the Church
of England. In addition we
have informed H R H C h a r l e s ,
Prince of Wales, of our
a c t i v i t i e s , who would, wrote
his aide, be " m o s t a m u s e d "
by them. Our patron the
Wizard of the Antipodes has
a l s o pledged that we shall
c e a s e all a c t i v i t i e s if " H e r
Majesty or Her M a j e s t y ' s
Government or Her envoys or
Her Representatives in the
Antipodes So d e c i d e . " A l s o
A l f ' s Army is based on
principles parallel to the
Boy Scout movement, and
no-one regards them as a
threat to democracy, surely!
A c t u a l l y , I appreciate
that Mr P a r k e r ' s comments on
A l f ' s Army (Imperialist-
pacifist-fun-type) w e r e
probably made with the
tongue in cheek attitude
with which we regard o u r s e l v e s .
If so I respect Mr Parker for
h i s insight and am glad at
least one person not in A l f ' s
doesn't take A l f ' s Army
seriously. However, Honour
demanded a reply!
May I just say one more
thing, unconnected with what
has gone before?
R C S U presented C C U
with their s h i e l d s , purloined
months before. I see this as
a precedent for the return
of our colours, captured by
R C S U unarmed (armless!)
forces on Morphy Day '75.
Naturally, the presentation
would take place with full
ceremony and A l f ' s pacifist
type army would undertake to
organise the c o l o n i s a t i o n ' of
any nearby rag objective in
the name of R C S U Rag '76, to
the great benefit of said
noble charity fund. I'm sure
their w i s e and enlightened
R C S p r e s s y would agree to this,
being wise and enlightened,
(and wanting to win the Rag
c o l l e c t i o n s race) if it was
suggested to him. (I'm too
shy).
Thank you for your kind
indulgence.
I am. Sir, your humble and
obedient servant,

NUS non-debatable
Sir, — Regarding last w e e k ' s
disaffiliation nen-debate, for
which the first motion was
that N U S is unrepresentative
of the bulk of student members,
from which the second motion
(that disaffiliation is the
best way to counter this)
was meant to follow.
I call it a non-debate
because the first motion,
which underpins the whole
disaffiliation argument, is
by nature a non-debatable
issue. Whether or not the
NUS represents its members'
v i e w s is a matter for systematic
research, and no amount of
rhetorical assertions which
merely beg the question, or
merely deny it, is going to
convince me one way or the
other.
Clearly what is needed is
a properly conducted survey
of the opinions of a represent-
ative sample of students.
Comparisons between student
opinions and N U S p o l i c i e s
can then be made, and
s e n s i b l e c o n c l u s i o n s can
be drawn. Opinion polls may
not be i n f a l l i b l e , but they
are patently more dependable
than these 'finger on the
pulse of the people' arguments.
Yours faithfully

Sir, — I would like to make a
few points regarding the
farcical debate I attended
last Friday on N U S .
(i) The misunderstanding
which resulted in the failure
to attend of one of the speakers
was unforgivable. Whoever
made the arrangements should
take the b lame for not c h e c k i n g
with Mr Minnis either by
letter or telephone. Thus,
the debate w a s already
unfair and heavily weighted
in Mr C l a r k e ' s favour.
(ii) A l l credit must be
given to Pete Teague for
speaking for the motion, at
such short notice. I think
most students would agree
that he spoke much better
than C h a r l e s C l a r k e , who
managed to avoid the motion
for much of h is speech
(iii) The major event of
the meeting was the voting
on the second part of the
motion, whether or not to
disaffiliate. From my position,
the voting looked approximately
5 0 - 5 0 , or possibly a slight
majority to d i s a f f i l i a t e .
Obviously most people agreed
with me, as when the result
was read out; there was
stunned s i l e n c e . I am sure
the counting of the votes was
done with complete sincerity,
but is not this method of
vote counting liable to error?
I am sure nobody present
expected such a difference
Deputy President
answers critics
Sir, — I was very interested
to see a letter of c r i t i c i s m
lodged against me in F E L I X
No 4 f 2 and would like to
take this opportunity to
reply to these c r i t i c i s m s .
Indeed the Union is for
the students, for all of the
students, and I would hope
that they make as much use
of Union f a c i l i t i e s as p o s s i b l e .
However, as D P , one of my
main responsibilities is the
Union Building and this
includes d i s c i p l i n e within
it. If, at any time, members
of a particular club or
society are found to be
misusing the f a c i l i t i e s
or behaving in a manner
other than that which is
reasonable, t h e n I am
empowered to take such
steps a s are necessary to
deal with the situation.
On this o c c a s s i o n , due
between the totals.
Concluding, a secret
ballot would -be the fairest
way of s o l v i n g this issue
once and for all (well, for a
few years at least). T h i s
would provide the true,
democratic result, and stop
all the uncertainty, which
has gone on this year. P l e a s e ,
Mr Teague and company,
could not this be arranged
before the end of term?
Yours faithful ly.
J S T U A R T MatRs I
to the unreasonable attitudes
of certain members of the
Snooker C l u b who failed to
produce their Union cards on
request, I had no choice but
to c l o s e the room. I would
therefore not agree that
Messrs M i l l s and Latter
were deprived of Union
f a c i l i t i e s because of " a
personal grudge" between
the above people and myself.
I would remind Messrs
M i l l s and Latter that the
situation was fully explained
to them when they accosted
me in the Union bar on the
same evening. Surely they
realise that it would have
been a complete contradiction
to allow them the use of the
snooker tables after having
closed these f a c i l i t i e s down
for the night and e s p e c i a l l y
since the incident had yet
to be resolved with the
appropiate parties.
Despite this, I would
reiterate my apologies to all
Union members who were
inconvenienced by this
regrettable action.
In c o n c l u s i o n , I would
like tn point out that I w a s
misquoted in so much as
I did not say "the innocent
always sutler", but that
"unfortunately, some innocent
people always suffer through
the actions of the inconsiderate
few".
Yours sincerely
R I Z S H A K I R
Deputy President
