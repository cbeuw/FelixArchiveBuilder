IC RAG
Wishes to announce an open
meeting in the ICWA L O U N G E
on T U E S D A Y 9th M A R C H at
7.00pm in order to select
next years minor charity
(gasp!)
If you know any s m a l l ,
under-developed, unfinanced
charity (other than yourself)
on whose behalf y o u are
w i l l i n g to speak for a few
minutes, do come along.
CLEANING
A S 20% O F T H E women
c l e a n i n g staff and forewomen
are off s i c k with influenza,
there w i l l n e c e s s a r i l y be
a cut-back in non-essential
cleaning s e r v i c e s . Priority
w i l l be given to hygiene,
particularly as related to
women's cloakrooms.
We would a s k y o u to
bear wit h u s , by not adding
to the difficulty by making
minor complaints during the
next few w e e k s , until the
influenza epidemic subsides.
Thank y o u ,
Domestic Superintendent
