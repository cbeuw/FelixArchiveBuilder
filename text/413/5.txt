Immediately after the N U S disaffiliation
debate last Thursday
Charles Clarke
talked to Clive Dewey
FELIX: Charles, what are your feelings
about today's debate?
C L A R K E : I thought it w a s fairly
satisfactory. I think it reflects the
problem that N U S has had for some time
now and that's getting across to
students in ordinary unions what our
p o l i c i e s and activities really are. I
think that w a s reflected i n the first
vote (IC voted overwhelmingly that
NUS i s unrepresentative). Obviously
Im glad that the question of disaffiliation
has finally put an end to it.
We are very keen to encourage
more active student involvement
in their own unions, and of course
at some stage we need to look at
s o m e c h a n g e s to the N U S
constitution'.
In the last year we've seen great
efforts to 'democratise' NUS. What
are you and the Executive doing to
prevent the shambles at Scarborough
caused by Alistair Stewart's mis-
representation of the Electoral Reform
Society?
I don't think Scarborough was a shambles
in the w a y you describe. T h e k e y
thing we're trying to do to democratise
NUS i s to get across to the membership
what the p o l i c i e s are and what's going
on. National Student i s the most recent
example of this.
We are very keen to encourage more
active student involvement in their
own unions, and of course at some
stage we need to look at some changes
to the N U S constitution.
You mention National Student, what
were your feelings on this month's
issue?
Although it w a s the launching i s s u e ,
I w a s fairly pleased with it. It w a s
strong in the most important respects,
weak in one or two, but that's not
surprising. Generally I w a s very
pleased with it.
As regards news, do you think that a
weekly paper will be a much more
effective venture?
The main problem here i s o n e of
finance. Ideally w e ' d like to get it on
to a weekly b a s i s , but I don't see that
happening for sometime yet.
I think people will accept that the
key thing is to get the facts over
to the membership'. T h a t ' s what the
paper is about'. I don't just mean
NUS facts, but news about the
student movement as a whole'.
Do you think the activists who attend
NUS conferences will accept they cannot
have a campaigning newspaper and
will agree to finance the launching of a
fact-based weekly?
National Student is a student newspaper.
I think people w i l l accept that the key
thing is to get the facts over to the
membership. That's what the paper i s
about. I don't just mean N U S facts,
but news about the student movement
as a whole.
Do you feel that the prominence given
by the press and others to the Inter-
national debates is the cause of the
present 'disenchantment' with NUS
that you mentioned in the debate?
The International debates are certainly
amongst the most contentious and
thus get more coverage in both the
national a n d student p r e s s . I don't
myself feel that they take up a great
deal of the union's work. I think it
is important to maintain our International
l i a s o n with other unions and our
international activities on certain
p o l i t i c a l questions.
Are you trying to say that the dis-
enchantment boils down not to what we
fight on, but how we fight on the issues
affecting students?
T h a t ' s always been an issue. I myself
don't believe that just b y polite
arguement we c a n w i n the case. We
certainly need that polite arguement,
but we also need to be prepared to
show that students are backing that
particular c l a i m .
The only comment I'd make, is that
in the areas one mentions, be it
Grants, Overseas Students, whatever,
international events do have quite
an impact on what happens'.
/ take it then that you believe NUS's
first commitment is to its home students
and that the press should focus more on
NUS policy on Grants, Education, etc?
I'd agree with that a hundred p e r cent.
Certainly that i s the main orientation
of our p o l i c i e s . T h e only comment I'd
make, i s that in the areas one mentions,
be it Grants, Overseas Students,
whatever, international events do
have quite an impact on what happens.
For example i f D e n i s Healey goes to
do an o i l deal in the Middle E a s t , then
it h a s an impact on Overseas Students
because h e ' s talking about deals on
that kind of thing.
Let's talk about NUS's image. Do you
think its credibility could be enhanced
to produce a more effective unified
union?
There are certainly measures w h i c h
need to be taken. T h e disunity i s
essentially a feature of the current
p o l i t i c a l p o s i t i o n i n the country. There
is disunity, and there i s no cover-up
job I can do to hide that fact, and I
wouldn't desire to. B e c a u s e people
have different v i e w s a s to how we
should deal with the economic problems
facing u s .
"I myself don't believe
that just by polite
arguement we can win
the case."
IC has a large percentage of overseas
students. Could you perhaps tell us
your reaction and what NUS intends
doing about proposals to increase
overseas students fees to over Â£2,000
per annum?
We are totally opposed to these proposals.
They w i l l discriminate particularly
against the 83% of students who come
form the Third World and self-supporting.
We are organising a number of events;
the Overseas Students D a y of Action
has already taken p l a c e , as have
formal representations to the Government
and Members of Parliament.
Now that IC students have decided to
stay in NUS, what would you like to
see them help NUS?
The most important thing for Imperial
students to do i s to get out and support
the campaign (grants). I hope that
means on February 27th (grants
demonstration) t h e y ' l l come out and
support it. Much more than that i t ' s
necessary for everyone at the debate
to go out and argue the case with a l l
those students who weren't at the
meeting. Then for the students i n the
college to take it out more widely into
the community and gain support there.
Thank you very much Charles.
My pleasure.
