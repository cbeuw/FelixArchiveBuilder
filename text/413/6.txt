External Eclairs
A typical week in the life of an External Affairs Officer
M O N D A Y - Got up just in time for a 10.30am lecture. Having
survived this, I rushed off to the Union to check the post. I then
wrote up a lab report and typed a few envelopes for a petition
which I was circulating to all C o u n c i l members (on Discretionary
Grants). At 5.30pm I took a seat in the S C R for the Union F i n a n c e
Committee meeting. F i r s t we sorted out the Union Estimates for
next year and then went on to d i s c u s s major equipment c l a i m s
from the c l u b s and s o c i e t i e s , which are, of course, the most
important part of the Union for the ordinary student.
T U E S D A Y - Staggled out of bed at about 12.00 noon having
missed the morning's lecture and made, my way into C o l l e g e ,
stopping for some shopping en route. Distributed petitions and
settled down in the Union office to scribble a few lines for the
Alternative P r o s p e c t u s , which is to be sent out to prospective
freshers.
Chatted to J i l l D a n i e l s , President of R C A about IC students
using their refectories and various other topics. Phoned IF to
speak to Margaret Slimming, but s h e ' d gone to L i v e r p o o l .
At 5.30pm S T O I C wanted to interview me for some reason so
I went along and sat with C h a l k y , making faces at N i c k and Tony
while they were being interviewed.
Bushed straight off to E a l i n g T e c h n i c a l C o l l e g e with Duncan
Turner, secretary to the External A f f a i r s Committee, for a
meeting of the West London A r e a L S O . T h i s was extremely boring,
e s p e c i a l l y s i n c e we were inquorate and therefore unable to take
any d e c i s i o n s . I proposed that we make funds and transport for
the next N U S conference a v a i l a b l e to all small c o l l e g e s (less
than 750 students) in West London, and this was accepted.
P i c k e d up a Sennet on the way home — mostly as boring as
National Student. I was very interested to read about the election
procedure at Thames P o l y t e c h n i c , perhaps some of their ideas
are worth considering for IC.
W E D N E S A Y — A c t u a l l y made it to lectures today. Went along
to the J C R at lunchtime to hear the arguments. I'm afraid I
don't quite understand the need for a separate " a c t i o n g r o u p " ,
surely the Overseas Student Committee is adequate? Spent an
hour or so wandering around the C o l l e g e putting up posters for
the demo today.
I phoned up Brunei University to talk to P h i l Stopford, their
External Affairs V P . He told me that they are a l s o knee-deep
in e l e c t i o n s ; the new President is J i m D a l e , an Independent
S o c i a l i s t . I was interested to hear that D a v i d W i l k s , (the first
C o n s e r v a t i v e , to be elected to an N U S Committee s i n c e 1969,
when he received the most first preference votes at the recent
U n i v e r s i t i e s Conference), had been elected President at L e i c e s t e r
University by 1000 votes to 200. L a s t y e a r ' s President was a
Marxist. That should send the old swing-o-meter beserk!
In the evening I attended the U L U S R C (Students Representative
C o u n c i l ) , which was addressed by Ralph Dahrendorf on the
subject of Overseas students' fees. Trevor P h i l l i p s , President of
U L U , told us of d i s c u s s i o n s which he had recently had with
M P s . Another member of the C o u n c i l reported on the I L E A
meeting which he had attended that afternoon. They had decided
RIDING
What springs to your mind
when " H o r s e - R i d i n g " is
mentioned? Thelwel has a
lot to answer for, for riding's
image! Yet riding is an
increasingly popular sport as
the s u c c e s s of the recently
formed R i d i n g C l u b testifies.
The R i d i n g C l u b first
officially came into e x i s t a n c e
at the end of last term and
has been growing steadily
ever since to its present
membership of twenty-eight.
T o quote its constitution, it
e x i s t s " t o aid its members in
the art of horsemanship and
the promotion of a general
interest in riding throughout
the C o l l e g e , and also to
promote competition between
the club and other c l u b s of
the University of L o n d o n . "
Every Wednesday afternoon,
twelve members of the club
go to Trent Park Stables in
E n f i e l d , a large R i d i n g School
chosen because:-
(i) it gives reduced rates
to students,
(ii) at the same time beginners
may receive lessons while
more experienced riders can
ride in the two hundred acres
of wooded parkland that make
up the Park. It is a l s o
possible to receive more
advanced tuition, which is
quite popular, although it is
at full rate. Thus Trent Park
Stables can run three different
types of riding at the same
time, a valuable feature.
However, such is the
demand that we are now
investigating other riding
schools in London with a
view to running more than
one ride a week, and to
broaden o u r a c t i v i t i e s
further.
It is a l s o our hope to form
a riding team to represent IC
in competition with other
London C o l l e g e s and perhaps
other U n i v e r s i t i e s .
A l lof this sounds expensive.
Yet riding need not be nearly
s o expensive a pastime as
it is generally thought. Nor
do you need to p o s s e s s
" f u l l r e g a l i a " to ride. So,
if you have a pair of jeans
and are interested, come
along and find out more about
the club any Thursday between
1.30 and 2.20pm in room 407A
in the Department of E l e c t r i c a l
Engineering.

to cutback overseas student places by 60% by 1982, which we
thought was a d i s a s t e r since this would mean the closure of
many c o u r s e s and several c o l l e g e s .
I spoke to Trev P h i l l i p s before the meeting began and he
asked me whether it was true that N i c k Brayshaw was standing
for P r e s i d e n t . "I think I'll just have to go back and stand m y s e l f " ,
he s a i d .
T H U R S D A Y - Having been up until 2.00am writing my report for
council and sorting out some problems in my lab report, I over-
slept and missed yet another lecture. But I managed to make
my assessment which went rather w e l l .
Today of course was the day of the Great Debate. C h a r l e s
C l a r k e managed to speak for about 15 minutes without approaching
the subject. When I got up to speak it was hard to find anything
to say s i n c e Pete Teague had already said it a l l , c o n c i s e l y ,
and l o g i c a l l y as he always does. I hope that I managed to clarify
a few points and I hope C h a r l e s takes them to heart. The result
was, in my opinion, very satisfactory — the vote of about 360
to 41 for the part of the motion expressing the view that N U S
does not represent the views of its membership was better than
I had hoped for, and the vote on disaffiliation surprised C h a r l e s
by its c l o s e n e s s . I should just like to point out that the F E L I X
report was not quite correct in stating that those present voted
to stay in N U S — in fact, the meeting voted that disaffiliation was
not the best way to changa the Union. I hope that the Union officers
can interpret that as a mandate to change the N U S by other
means, that i s , by working through the inadequate but existing
p r o c e s s .
I relaxed in the evening by getting rather drunk before, during
and after G u i l d s Revue. I made two mental notes while in the
Union bar; (a) it is about time that the Union bought the External
Affairs Officer a pot, s i n c e the bar tends to run out of pint
g l a s s e s when two C C U functions end up in the bar; (b) I must
ask John Downs to explain the technique of drinking a yard of
a l e .
F R I D A Y — I thought this was to be a quiet day — nothing down in
the diary except for a Welfare committee meeting. But as soon as
I entered the Union office at 11.30am, it all changed. Apparently
C h r i s C u l l e n , Andy V a l l a n c e - O w e n , Tony Brown and a few other
people from the Students for Representative P o l i c i e s group had
been studying their N U S direct action briefing, s i n c e they had
occupied 3 E n d s l e i g h Street, the N U S Head Office. I was immedi-
ately on the phone: no reply from N U S , so I tried Brunei —
Stopford had been up till 4.00am at vote counting and consequently
had not surfaced. So I rang Dave Hughes at K i n g s ' and he gave
me the story. I found a few useful people, that i s , Messrs Barratt,
Santilli and Housden and jumped into the nearest taxi crying
" E n d s l e i g h S t r e e t , p l e a s e " . When we arrived, it w a s all happening.
Due to a press leak, their move had been anticipated and so the
occupiers had only held the ground floor. Everyone was there •* all
the N U S h a c k s , the W R P , the C P , U C L F a s c i s t Society, etc. It
was interesting to note that C l a r k e ' s first reaction was to tell
the students that if they broke into the f i l e s , the N U S executive
would c a l l in the p o l i c e . Of course, the former is exactly the
procedure advocated by the N U S themselvesl The protest
e s s e n t i a l l y concerned the Bucharest bean feasto, and a copy
of the 17 page communique was c i r c u l a t e d . It was a nauseating as
I had expected, full of the usual leftist c l i c h e s , and perhaps not
in itself worth worrying about - but the N U S still have to justify
wasting money on this sort of thing.
