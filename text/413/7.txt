Socialist Zionism
IT M A Y S U R P R I S E some to
learn that S o c i a l i s m has been
intertwined with modern
Z i o n i s m s i n c e the beginning,
the most notable proponent
being Ber Borochov. Born in
the Ukraine, Borochov took
part in the S o c i a l i s t movements
in R u s s i a around the turn of
the 20th century, spent ten
years in political e x i l s after
having been imprisioned for
two years, and died an
untimely death in R u s s i a in
1917 on the eve of the
R u s s i a n revolution.
Borochov analysed the
J e w i s h problem in Marxist
terms. He noted that although
there was a large J e w i s h
proletariat, its role was
marginal, this being in the
nature of the occupations.
The economic structure of
the J e w i s h people in Eastern
Europe, compared to other
nations, was abnormal,
e s p e c i a l l y in that J e w s were
usually not employed in the
primary means of production.
An example is that whilst
many J e w s might be cobblers,
few, if any, were farmers
and kept the c a l v e s from
which the leather was obtained
In other words, even if
vast numbers of J e w i s h
workers went on strike, the
impact on the national
economy would be negligible.
Further, even if J e w s tried
to move to other spheres of
activity, there would be
resistance from the existing
Gentile labour force, resulting
in emigration, amongst other
things.
The only solution to
occupational redistribution
and economic normalisation
was the concentration of
J e w s in a national homeland:
P a l e s t i n e . T h i s would then
become the base in the
fight for a S o c i a l i s t society.
Israeli society today is

groupings that grew out of
this Social ist Z i o n i s t
movement,and a representative
of one of them was recently
welcomed by IC J e w i s h
Society as speaker. Nahum
Sneh of " M a p a m " , the
United Workers Party, spoke
about the development of
Labour Z i o n i s m . He dealt
with the aspects already
mentioned and went on to
d i s c u s s the attitude of his
p a r t y to P a l e s t i n i a n s .
E s s e n t i a l l y , it has always
recognised Arab P a l e s t i n i a n
national rights in P a l e s t i n e ,
side by side with J e w i s h
national rights, but rejects
some of the currant P L O
ideas because they would
reduce the J e w s to a second
c l a s s religious minority. H e
pointed out the oft-forgotten
fact that already Weizmann
(a chemist who later became
the first president of Israel)
had conceded that part of
the P a l e s t i n e problem lay
in the c l a s h of two rights.
Arab leaders did not
s e i z e the chance to rise up
against British c o l o n i a l i s m ,
but the J e w i s h battle against
foreign domination reached a
c l i m a x in the War of
Independence in 1948/9.
F i n a l l y Nahum Sneh felt
that an old saying s t i l l
holds good: " Z i o n i s m is the
national liberation movement
of the J e w i s h p e o p l e " .
To put the Mapam party
into political context, I
would like to add that in
1974, after the last Israeli
e l e c t i o n s , Mapam provided
two Ministers out of a
Cabinet of twenty-one, whilst
the Israel Labour Party
provided fourteen. A s far as
the stand of the party is
concerned, Sneh described it
as approximating to the
British left-wing " T r i b u n e "
group.

Lighter than air flight
A N T H O N Y SMITH, the well
known j o u r n a l i s t and
broadcaster, gave an absorbing
lecture on the subject of
ballooning and " H o w to
B u i l d Your Own A i r s h i p " .
He explained the situations
one should not get into when
ballooning, or rather landing
after the flight, such as
avoiding being charged by
a rhino; this he discovered
when he was landing in the
Serengeti National Park. One
of the problems in flying over
remote areas is that one must
be in contact with one's
ground crew — the alternative
is a long walk!
Mr Smith and his friends
have the distinction of being
the owners of one of the
eight airships in the world.
They built it themselves, and
he talked amusingly about
the red tape they ran into with
the c i v i l aviation authorities,
and then went on to explain
about the technical difficulties
they encountered. One problem
was that in effect they were
starting from scratch as the
literature which existed
from the " G o l d e n A g e of
a i r s h i p s " was very s p e c i a l i s e d ,
and hence they had not
been use to his group until
they had obtained some
practical experience.
He concluded by saying
that in general there was
a great future for airships
in cargo handling.
Next summer, his group
hope to test their airship in
B r a z i l . Apparently this is
one of the best places to
fly. At the end of the lecture,
Mr Smith made a small
request. Anyone want to
buy an airship?
Holidays for deprived
children
A R R A N G E M E N T S are being made to send four children to
the United States for a month's holiday at a Y . M . C . A . Summer
camp. The camp is charging them no fees as these children
are in care,-are a l l from deprived families and have never
had a holiday. To make this trip possible £500 must be
raised to pay for their airfares.
The problem of raising £500 is proving more difficult
than was first believed p o s s i b l e . The venture does not
seem to fit into the right category for donations for most
charitable foundations to make a contribution.
Approaches have been made to travel companies but so
far only brochures with the apprpriate price lists have
been returned.
It would be a great pity if the holiday had to be c a n c e l l e d
and the generous offer from the camp refused. The camp
is the Ralph S. Mason camp in New Jersey 70 miles from
New York. It is a mixed camp for about 300 children aged
between eight and fifteen. The f a c i l i t i e s are superb. There
are opportunities to take part in a wide range of sports,
including canoeing, archery, boating and riding; and there
are many other a c t i v i t i e s , such as art and crafts, photo-
graphy and music.
It is a marvellous opportunity for the four children
concerned, and it is disheartening that it has received such
a negative response from a l l the organisations that have
been approached for help. E s p e c i a l ly as it was hoped, if this
y e a r ' s w a s s u c c e s s f u l , to organise the scheme on a permanent
b a s i s .
If you know of any group of people or organisation who
might be interested in contributing or raising funds, then
contact T . C . M e r n i c k l e , Mech Eng Dept, Imperial C o l l e g e .
It does not have to be in the region of £500, a l l offers for
help in raising funds w i l l be appreciated. Karen Gadd
