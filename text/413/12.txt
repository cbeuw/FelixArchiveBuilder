Binder and Gibson win tense final
T H E FINALS for the Whitbread
Cup were played last week
and proved to be a tense,
nail-biting affair. In the
quarter-final stages, Neil
Binder and Mike Gibson
cruised to a comfortable
victory over D Bales and
Andy Devaney.
They were followed into
semi-finals by P Whitlock a n d
J Hughes who won by default;
A Gribble and K Freeman
who beat A l a n Whatling and
B i l l Jeffery in a very c l o s e
game; and T Adey and I
McDermott who came from
behind to w i n against Ian
H a l l and Stuart Adamson.
In the first semi-final,
Whitlock and Hughes won a
comfortable first game against
Binder and G i b s o n who
began slowly and never
looked threatening. However,
in the second game, both
pairs were more evenly
matched and only a fine
finish by Gibson gave him
victory over the other pair.
Binder and G i b s o n won the
third game after e s t a b l i s h i n g
a clear l e a d .
The second semi-final w a s
l e s s of a fire-cracker with
Adey and McDermott scoring
consistently throughout and
also achieving the highest
score of the evening — 138.
They eventually won 2—0 to
reach the final.
The f i n a l , between two
pairs who h a d , until then,
never met in a game, proved
to be an exciting match with
A d e y and McDermott beginning
w e l l and running up a
confident 2—0 lead although
Binder and G i b s o n played
competently. Binder and
Gibson however, avoided
defeat by sneaking home the
whitewash-beater with a
calm double one in the third
game. In a high scoring
fourth game, Binder slotted
home to square the match at
2 - 2 .
The final game of the
match see-sawed back and
fourth until the penultimate
throw with Binder and G i b s o n
on double one and A d e y and
McDeimott on double two. T h e
match w a s finally decided
by G i b s o n who snatched
victory from almost ignomi-
nious defeat.

J O H N WHITE, better known
as C h a l k e y , was elected
as Honorary Secretary of
IC Union at yesterday's
Union meeting. T h i s followed
the resignation of Mervyn
P i t c h e r s from the elections
last Wednesday which left
Mr White as the only candidate
running.
The Union meeting at
w h i c h the main b u s i n e s s o f
the day was the husting of
candidates for the sabbatical,
D P and N U S delegate elections
w a s the most well attended
to date. T h e meeting was
livered up by Mike Williams
falling asleep during the
presidential hustings and then
during h i s proposal speech
swearing at a certain member
of the audience.
Union Bar Knickers
Scandal
A P R O P S A L by Mary Atten-
borough, Mathematics depart-
mental representative, that
each member of I C Union
E x e c u t i v e should d o n a t e a
pair of their underpants to
the Union bar was narrowly
carried by 13 votes to 10
with five abstentions at the
last Union C o u n c i l meeting.
The proposal was seen as
a " i f y o u can't beat ' e m ,
j o i n ' e m " move i n the latest
round of the Union bar k n i c k e r s
scandal. Mr Teague, I C U
President and chairing the
meeting at the time, inquired
as to where the underpants
were to be placed in the bar.
Where upon M s Attenborough
replied instantly " O n top of
the l a d i e s k n i c k e r s " . T h e
recommendation i s (not) to be
carried out.
The meeting however, did
d i s c u s s l e s s trivial matters
than this.
Due to the large number of
thefts recently from functions
organised by the U n i o n , the
D P , after consultations with
the I C U E x e c and the E n t s
Chairman, Andy Higman, h a s
decided that only N U S members
and guests o f I C students
(who must be signed in the
guest book to be provided)
w i l l be allowed into I C
functions.
T h i s measure w i l l not be
implemented until next year.
The Working Party on
Union Response presented
an interim report in which
various short-term changes
to the Union structure were
proposed.A lengthy d i s c u s s i o n
followed which resulted in
an open meeting of the
Working Party being c a l l e d
with the date yet to be
decided. T h i s date w i l l be
widely p u b l i c i s e d and all
members o f the Union w i l l
be most welcome to air
their v i e w s .
Chris Kourouniotis how-
ever, provided the sensation
of the afternoon when he
refused to make a speech and
answer questions. T h i s
followed a proposal speech
by Ms Attenborough in which
she attacked the election
campaign bumph of Mr
Everett who i s also a
candidate for the post of
Deputy President.
The polling days for these
elections are on Monday 1st
March and Tuesday 2nd
March. Voting for the N U S
delegation will be on the
Monday and ballot boxes can
be found in the Union,'
Southside and J C R . There
w i l l also be a roving ballot
box.
