E x a c t l y 100 teams began
the race at three o ' c l o c k on
Saturday at the start in
Rotten R o w and 97 teams
finished. According to one
seasoned runner, the ground
was very hard and the
long straight section on the
north side of the Se'rpentine
was . . . unpleasant. T h i s
was because runners were
able to see the course
stretching out in front of them
for miles and miles.

Netherlands competed i n

quiet " a r e you ready ... G o "
from one of the o f f i c i a l s .
In the first three laps the

radically each time runners

Congratulations are due
to the Imperial C o l l e g e Cross
Country C l u b , their executive
committee and e s p e c i a l l y
to R i c h Harrington for
organising the event with
such efficiency. T h e R o a d
R e l a y h a s become an important
event in most B r i t i s h and
some Continental U n i v e r s i t i e s
calenders and w i l l hopefully
remain s o .
Oh by the w a y , the I C
contingent came 24th. A
notable run from R o b A l l i n s o n
on the third l e g lifted us from
40th to 22nd and there
approximately, we remained.
