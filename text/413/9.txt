Concerts Flyers flop asHot Rods rock on
Kursaat F l y e r s / E d d i e and the Hot Hods
I T ' S N O T E V E R Y pub-rock band that
appears on pretentious art programmes
on the B B C , and has two albums on
the market, but the Kursaal F l y e r s have
achieved a l l this. So I don't think I
could be judged harsh, for expecting
something above average, but for me,
the band's brand of s l e a z y , B-movie
music came in furlongs behind the
exciting rock'n'roll animal that w a s
Eddie and the Hot R o d s .
The Hot R o d ' s singer, besplendent
in odd striped pyjamas who w a s
presumably ' E d d i e ' , w a s the hero of
the night, cartwheeling, running and
jumping h i s way through a variety of
good rockin' songs, drawing on what
seemed limitless amounts of energy

Here, for public delectation, i s
the second instalment of Alan. Douglas'
trilogy of make-what-you-can-of-400-
hours-of-unused-Hendrix-factory-jams
albums, a b a s i c a l l y thankless task no
doubt motivated by greenies before
the e y e b a l l s .
The genius of the man (Hendrix,
that is) i s still there — that's been
evident in even h i s worst moments,
except the pitiful " I s l e of Wight"
release when he w a s most definitely
unfit for play, but the way that the
performances have had to be fiddled
with, edited, and abruptly lopped off
in p l a c e s shows how desperate people
can get when they think they're onto a
sure thing and have to c a p i t a l i s e on it.
The title track i s a tasty little
Hendrix blues, with a solo that sounds
beautifully co-ordinated and rehearsed
for something that has been allowed
to gather dust for years in a warehouse
awaiting the outcome of a l l the legal
to maintain the v i s u a l excitement of
his acrobatics. I got the impression
there w a s a frustrated violence trying
to escape through E d d i e ' s act, which
seemed to me to range from the
sexuality of Jagger to the absurdity of
C h a p l i n . A l l this w a s backed up by
the Hot Rods themselves, a tighter
bunch of young rockers you couldn't
wish to see or hear anywhere.
So to the Kursaal F l y e r s , stars of
stage, screen and the N M E . They were
very well received by the s i z e a b l e
attendance, why, I cannot s a y , their
set being a much more limp one than
that of their predecessors. True, I
was not exactly familiar with the

Thirdly, lastly, finally and in
conclusion, the 21st National Student
Drama F e s t i v a l i s rapidly approaching,
it takes place in Edinburgh from 2—9
A p r i l , a n d , although IC will be un-
represented this year, still promises
to give a good time to a l l participants,
whether active or p a s s i v e .
Last year, in London, IC Dramsoc's
performance of A l b e r t ' s Bridge by
Tom Stoppard w a s one of the highlights
(you may have seen a photograph of
the p r o d u c t i o n in the new N U S
newspaper). A number of Dramsoc
members spent the whole week at the
F e s t i v a l and found it stimulating and
exciting. If you want to know more
about the 1976 F e s t i v a l I suggest you
contact me or those in the Dramsoc
storeroom. T h e programme i s likely to
be announced next week.

h a s s l i n g and double-dealing that has
been going on since James Marshall •
Hendrix moved on to (hopefully) better
times.
" H e a r my t r a i n " i s of course just
a filler, considering the completeness
of the eleven-and-a-quarter minute
version on the " R a i n b o w b r i d g e " s e t .
No way could you add much to that
version.
Hearing this, so many years after
h e ' s disappeared from the forefront of
the b i z brings back the reason why h e ' s
considered s o great — the amount of
" f e e l i n g " to be found everywhere in
his playing. T h i s record isn't perfect,
it's not precise or c r i s p , not even
technically amazing, but it contains
greater things than d e v i c e s or studio
techniques can produce. It's inspired
music, where Hendrix constantly
explores, and i t ' s beautifully uncontrived
and natural.
There are some dodgy moments, a s
Dobin Degoslow
repertoire, save for their single
'Speedway', but then neither am I
with the Hot R o d ' s .
Paul Shuttleworth, much photographed
singer of the F l y e r s , came on like
Southend's answer to Humphry Bogart,
s l i d i n g h i s way through a particularly
gutless set of songs, which for some
reason, seemed to be setting the
audience alight. Ironically the K u r s a a l ' s
highest moment came with the encore.
Gene P i t n e y ' s " 2 4 Hours from T u l s a " .
In a pub atmosphere, the lyrics and
mannerisms of Shuttleworth probably
come across better, but like their
fellow booze band Kilburn and the
High Roads, no way are they going to
make it on the concert circuit.

JULIE TIPPETS - FREE3IRD!
natural to do it like that. I mean, I've
done a lot of experimenting in the last
few years, and had intended a couple of
years ago to make a completely 'free'
album,' sort of using the same sort of
layers, but completely free, no actual
structures. But then I found I w a s
actually writing songs, you know, and it
came out like t h a t . "
Right now J u l i e Tippetts i s rehearsing
her new band, Butterfly, in readiness
for a short tour of mostly c o l l e g e s ,
which started in Manchester on February
24th followed by a London g i g at Kings
C o l l e g e two days later.
. D i d she s e e the band staying
together a s a long term thing?
" W e ' r e seeing how it goes with this
tour. I mean obviously it would be nice
to carry it on if it feels good, and if
people like it. There are tentative
plans for it in the future, but at the
moment I just want to get these two
weeks out of the way. There are things
in the a i r for going abroad, but I'd just
like to see how it goes and take it from
there — I don't want to look too far

Her coffee remains untouched ... but
I never doubted her for a moment.

Ekpenyong and a l l the other readers
who were fooled by last w e e k ' s review.
A s far a s I know the C h i e v e l e y Theatre
does not exist and no playwright has
been crafty enough to claim the author-
ship of the three plays described
;though I am working o n ' t ) .
Secondly, the latest news from the
National Theatre on their ticket s e l l i n g
scheme. Y o u will remember that, a few
weeks ago, I mentioned that the cheapest
seats available for booking in advance
in the Lyttelton Theatre will be £2.35;
the £1 and 50p seats will only be
available on the day of the performance
to those w i l l i n g to queue at 8.30an
Their latest advertisement s a y s , in
very small print, that for performances
from May 1st they will s e l l half the
cheap seats in advance. T h a t ' s progress
for you.
