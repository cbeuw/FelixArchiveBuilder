Well, here we go again -
'all the fun of the 'ayre' as
the elections get under way.
Just as one begins to see
clearly a l l the p o s s i b i l i t i e s
for new development within
a group, one finds one's term
of office coming to an end.
Thus, the first thing I would
say to someone standing for
a Union post is — be warned!
a year is incredibly short.
The ICWA nomination
papers are now up and if
you are thinking of standing
for a post, the following
outline of what the jobs
involve may be helpful.
The President's job is one of
providing initiative and new
ideas with regards to the
running of the A s s o c i a t i o n ,
representing its members on
committees and taking a keen
interest in their welfare. So
if you consider that you know
which direction ICWA should
take next year, stand 'or
election.
A s you will be aware
there is much activity within
the Women's Movement in
other colleges and groups.
Acting as a liaison between
these groups and the committee
is the Deputy P r e s i d e n t ' s role.
If you are concerned about
women's status and would be
prepared to attend outside
meetings, this is the post
for you.
There is no mystic when
it comes to the role of the
Honorary Secretary, as such,
you would be sending out
notices for and taking
minutes at committee meetings,
coping with the paper work
and in general greatly con-
tributing to the efficient
running of the A s s o c i a t i o n .
The next post in the ICWA
hierarchy, if such a term can
be used for s o informal an
assembly, is that of the
Treasurer without whom no
organisation c a n hope to
function smoothly. The job is
not difficult but is v i t a l ,
it i s an excellent training
for aspiring accountants!
(And thats 25% of the ICWA
mem bership.)
There are various groups
within ICWA which have a
representative on the committee
for example, the women in
Science and Technology
group. If you have been
actively involved! in the
group this year and would
like to see its s c o p e developed
to include a large percentage
of ICWA, stand for a post
on the committee.
Who organises the Annual
Dinner, the B a l l etc? Answer:
the Entertainments officers.
If you have a flair for
organising and would enjoy
planning social events then
you are a potential Ents
Officer. Of course, it is
pointless organising events
if nobody knows about them
which is why we need a
Publicity Officer and Dep
Reps. I would, however, like
to elaborate on the role of
dep reps as not only do they
let the departments know what
the committee is doing, but
they a l s o provide the essential
feedback from the departments
so that the A s s o c i a t i o n ' s
a c t i v i t i e s reflect the needs
and wants of its members.
The need for this cannot be
stressed enough. The dep
rep's role is a key one,
but sadly, in the past, people
holding these posts have
failed to realise this. Only
with dep reps can ICWA
operate to its members best
advantage s o , if you stand for
a post please remember this
and play a full part in the
decision m a k i n g and
organising.
A s you can see from the
above each post is inter-
related and the whole thing
involves a lot of team effort.
Standing for a post, winning
it and then not pulling your
weight is letting both your
fellow committee members
and ICWA at large down.

next year is ICWA gather
increasing momentum from the
thrust we have given it this
year. ICWA can be very
worthwhile playing an
essential part in college
life or it can be worthless.
Which it is to be if entirely
up to you.
