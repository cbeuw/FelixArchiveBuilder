10 M U X
IC FOLK CLUB
T h e R i s e and F a l l
F O R T H O S E who have not heard, the
Imperial C o l l e g e F o l k Song C l u b has
cancelled the last five events planned
for the 1975—76 academic year, including
the t e r m l y C e i l i d h , and a guest
appearance by Rosie Hardman.
The reason? The club has over
two hundred members in and around
IC, but in recent weeks we have
regularly run the club with barely
twenty people in the audience. Evidently,
there has been a sudden drop in interest
in folk music; or perhaps there is a
general concensus of opinion that IC
Folk Club is not as good as it once
was; or maybe it is too expensive, or
the last bus is too unreliable, or tube
fares are too high, or there is too
much work to do . . . . ? ? ? ? Whatever the
reason there is little point in continuing.
It is both embarrassing to the organisers,
and insulting to the guests, to ask
professional singers to travel a couple
of hundred miles to play to so few
people, however enthusiastic they
may oe.
But enough of moaning about the
past:
Nomination papers have already
been posted for next year's committee,
who traditionally take over at Easter.
There will be an A G M before the end
of term, at which I hope there will be
some serious d i s c u s s i o n about the
future of the club. Indeed, the credibility
of the entertainment for " m i n o r i t y "
groups in C o l l e g e could be a serious
subject for debate. Does it matter if
F o l k C l u b disappears? Maybe J a z z
Club will be next? Maybe F i l m Soc?
Maybe Ents? If s t u d e n t s want
entertainment " O n C a m p u s " , they
sometimes seem very reluctant to show
it! If they do not want it, we may as well
all give up! I hope that Folk C l u b will
reappear in October, as strong and
enjoyable as ever. I hope there will
be someone there to join in the chorus,
too.
