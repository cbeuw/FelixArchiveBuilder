RENT STRIKE
SPECIAL
EXTRA
C I S I O N
T H U R S D A Y
The purpose of this special issue of " Felix " is to
tell you about Rent Strikes, and why it is proposed
that we hold one i n Imperial College.
A t the end of last year, several provincial university
unions decided that, since their hall fees were so high,
and were greatly in excess of the "notional element" of
£240 allowed for i n the grant (£275 i n London) they
would go o n rent strike until increases scheduled on
these fees were cancelled a n d the fees tied to the
motional element. Major centres were Surrey, Dundee
and Keele.
It worked. So, at Margate Conference in November,
N U S delegates from colleges all over Britain voted to
use the Rent Strike weapon i n order to force the gov-
ernment to increase student grants. A call went out for
a national rent strike, a n d 25 unions have already
responded positively. Ten more are discussing whether
to hold one this week. That includes us.
O n Thursday, at 1 p.m. i n the Great H a l l , a U G M
will decide whether or not we should join the 25. The
motion that will be put to the U n i o n is' printed below
in its entirety. Elsewhere in this issue you can read how
the campaign was born at Margate Conference; John
Lane explains how a rent strike would work; we have a
report of the Campaign Co-ordinating Committee (set
up by the N U S ) first meeting; and a report on how the
rent strike at Surrey University last term worked.
In future weeks we shall be able to tell you how rent
strikes are working at other universities i n Britain, or
how they are failing. This week a L o n d o n Student
Press Association team is visiting 8 Midlands univer-
sities, and their report will appear first in F E L I X next
week. It is hoped that other teams will visit other parts
of the country over the next few weeks.
Finally, it might seem to you that having a rent strike
is now a fait accompli, having read what appears in this
issue. It is not. It is only a proposal.
WHETHER OR NOT TO HAVE A RENT
STRIKE IS YOUR DECISION.
YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT THIS THURS-
DAY.
SEE Y O U A T THE UNION MEETING
THEN.
The Notion
Imperial College Unioni reaffirm its demand for
"£100 increase in the grant now" and "the full grant
for all who study'".
In the interests of a united campaign, l . C . U .
pledges full backing to the immediate demands of
the N.U.S. for
1. A n end to the discretionary award system which
allows local authorities to pay lower grants to
many students, particularly those in F E C o l -
leges.
2. A n end to discrimination against married women
students.
3. A n Interim grant increase of £65 to cover the
cost of inflation since 1971. *
4. A n annual grant review based on a student cost
index.
This union notes the "secondary but no less im-
portant" demand of the N.U.S. Margate Confer-
ence for higher grants for post-graduates. I.C.U.
strongly urges N.U.S. Executive to give this demand
much greater priority and itself resolves to treat it
as equal to the above four.
l . C . U . notes the rent strikes by nine student unions
last term and those proposed by twenty-five unions
this term, and expresses its whole-hearted solidarity
with a l l unions o n rent strike, whether against ex-
cessive rents or for higher granjts as part of the N U S
campaign.
l.C.U., observing the reduced taxation of the rich
and big business concerns and the increased expen-
diture on armaments by the Heath administration
believes that higher grants should be financed from
these sources rather than b y further taxation on
working people.
l . C . U . withdraws the voluntary levy of 35p per
week paid by students i n hall towards the cost of
new halls and calls for a l l future buildings to be
financed by a wealth tax.
l . C U . resolves on a two-pronged campaign aim-
ing
1. to win public support, and in particular that of
the organised working class, f o r our claim t o
demonstrate the united anger of 600,000 students
at the deterioration i n our living standards and
thus make it politically very difficult for the
government to reject our demands.
2. to use the only economic power we have, the
ability to withhold hall and house rents, to force
the college authorities to put intense pressure on
the Government to concede our claim.
l . C U . therefore mandates
1. the President, Executive and Council to organise
support for the N.U.S. grants campaign, in par-
ticular for
the U S K area activities
the L o n d o n demonstration o n Feb. 21st
the National Day of Action on M a r c h 14th.
2. the President and Departmental Representatives
to organise departmental meetings to discuss the
Grants Campaign.
3. U n i o n members i n hall or house to pay their
rents bill less £3.85 new halls levy into a special
rent strike fund the contents of which will not
be paid to the college unless a resolution of an
I.C. U n i o n Meeting so instructs.
4. this meeting to elect a committee to organise a
rent strike.
5. the President to inform the media, N o r m a n St.
John Stevas, M.P., Secretary of State at the
Department of Education a n d Science, Lord
Penney, the N.U.S. and a l l unions involved i n
rent strikes, Hammersmith Trades Council, the
Briants' " W o r k - i n " and the trade unions in I.C.
of this resolution with a view to obtaining their
support.
