HOW, WHY AND WHEREFORE
A r e y o u sitting comfortably? D o you get three square
meals a day? D o y o u get Whizzo whiteness i n hot,
warm, even i n cold water? D o y o u enjoy sharing a flat
with people who get o n your nerves 'cos it's a l l you
can afford?
No?
Then what y o u need is

Below, i n superb tech-
nicolor (that'll stump
Dowson) (Yes, well, er,
John, try Black and White
Eroticolor? — E d ) is a
graph showing exactly
how inflation has hit
Y O U . A n d that gap is
getting wider each year.
The last grant review was
in 1971. Since then the
value of our grants has
decreased by a staggering
£65. Since 1962 the value
of grants has gone down
by nearly 2 0 % .
In addition, according
to the N.U.S., 5 0 % on
average of parental con-
tributions are never paid
in cash or kind, and since
this makes u p on average
30% of the total grant, we
suffer a grant cut of 15%
owing to the means test.
When you remember
that the most important
items i n a student's bud-
get: food, clothes a n d
books, are rising at 9.4%,
7.8% a n d 8.9% (alcohol
5.5%) annually a n d that
the effects of V A T and
Presidents
Column
the Common Market are
yet to come, it is time to
stop quoting figures and
do something about it.
V o t Is T o B e Done? (to
quote my good friend
V l a d i m i r Ilyich)
First thing is to cast
aside the defeatists who
say we can't bring the
country to a standstill and
exercise the power we d o
have. Rent Strike! B y
withholding hall and house
rents we can force the col-
lege t o put a great deal of
pressure o n the Govern-
ment. Especially if it is
part of a national hall rent
strike, which it will be
since 25 universities have
already decided o n one,
with a further ten discuss-
ing it this week. Especi-
ally if it is part of the
national campaign for
higher grants which
N.U.S. is launching this
term.
How would a Rent Strike
work?
E a c h student o n rent
strike would pay his or
her rent into a special
fund controlled by the
U n i o n General Meeting.
They would receive a re-
ceipt, and a copy of the
Rent F u n d constitution
and would have the right
to withdraw their rent if
they so wished. T h e
Union's auditors would
audit the accounts.

ise the strike with the
maximum of activities go-
ing o n i n the halls to keep
up morale, meetings, con-
certs, street theatres, news-
sheets, etc.
A l l of us must remem-
ber that it is the first year
students i n hall this year
who will benefit most from
a grant increase. Next
year they won't be i n hall,
next year they will have
to pay sky-high London
rents. It is then that a stu-
dent i n L o n d o n really feels
the pinch. Some are lucky
enough t o be i n hall more
than t w o years, but they
are not a majority and I
hope they will support
their fellOw students in the
campaign.
The National Campaign
This envisages three
phases. In late January
and early February area-
based actions — i n our
case a l l U S K colleges —
ideas suggested so far i n -
clude a total refectory boy-
cott, a lobby o f Parlia-
ment, mass leaflet distri-
bution/petition signing
session i n H i g h Street.
Kensington. O n February
21st there will be regional
demonstrations i n four or
five centres, including
London. This would show
our strength i n public, get
our demands national pub-
licity and get us all o n the
move for the National
Day of A c t i o n o n M a r c h
14th which will be based
in the college and a i m to
involve as many students
as possible.
Roight then, yew'ur
interlektshals, how about
some bright groovy and
original ideas for M a r c h
14th?
Support a n d Solidarity
N.U.S. Executive reck-
on that we will be favour-
ably received i n the edu-
cational world, i n trade
unions and also by some
sections of the press (no
prizes for guessing which).
Spring will be a n ideal
time to get the support of
the militant workers, 'cos
the freeze runs out then
and gas workers, civil ser-
vants, actors, hospital staff,
Ford workers, etc., will a l l
be fighting the same gov-
ernment for the same rea-
sons as us.
In this connection it is
especially important that
we make clear where the
money to pay for o u r
grant increase should
come from. A r e we doing
down the O l d A g e Pen-
sioners o r the low-paid
workers? I n fact, i n 1972
according t o the Financial
Times, profits increased
by 17%, the highest i n -
crease since 1969. It has
been Government policy
to cut taxes o n the
wealthy, and V A T will in-
crease the 'burden of i n -
direct taxation which hits
the low-paid (like stu-
dents) hardest.
So we have to tell the
ordinary people of this
country, the Old people,
the poor, the workers
fighting for higher wages
or against redundancy that
we are not demanding
higher grants at their ex-
pense but from the profits
of the industrial concerns
who will, after all, benefit
from our skills when we
start work.
