Society Readers' Letters
W h y should scientists a n d engineers, rather than ordinary w o r k i n g people
or people in professions have a special responsibility to society? Because of
the special skills a n d powers w h i c h they acquire during their training. T h e
learning of scientific method, a very powerful philosophical tool, enables
them to understand s o m e of the natural w o r l d , a n d hence to control it. T h e
knowledge thus gained m a y make them experts in their field, a n d their
judgements will be relied upon by these people, possibly in positions of
power, w h o d o not have the knowledge. T h e crux of s o c i a l responsibility is
for each scientist to d e c ' d e H O W he is to apply h i s knowledge, whether it is
to be for the benefit of m a n k i n d a s a whole, or for, say, a company or a
defence ministry.
In one area of science,
the ethical and moral
problems come under
close scrutiny. M e d i c a l
doctors use scientific
method in their work,
w h i c h because it involv-
es people directly, has a
professional body to ov-
ersee it, a n d a code of
c o n d u c t t o w h i c h all doc-
tors adhere. C o u l d this
system be extended to
include all scientists a n d
technologists? It w o u l d
be more difficult since
m e d i c i n e is a rather well
defined field: but at least
scientists involved in
m e d i c a l a n d pharmaceu-
tical research c o u l d
profitably be tied to a
code of conduct, the nat-
ure of w h i c h c o u l d be
kept under constant re-
view by a representative
group of scientists. In
this w a y it w o u l d be rec-
ognised that the ethical
problems raised by, say,
test-tube babies, were
being considered by the
scientific c o m m u n i t y as
a whole, a n d not by each
individual research wor-
ker.
Already, workers w h o
use vivisection in their
research are required to
hold a H o m e Office lic-
ence w h i c h embodies a
code of conduct. S h o u l d
workers w h o undertake
undesirable research be
'struck o f f ? This is a
very difficult question,
since it seeks to draw
the line between what is
neutral with regard to
knowledge a n d what is
not.
It c a n fairly be said
that knowledge is neu-
tral, but that its applica-
tion will inherently con-
tain the biases a n d pre-
judices of its user. It is
false to assume that the
knowledge gatherer (the
scientist) is totally neu-
tral in this respect a n d
that the knowledge ap-
plier (the engineer or
technologist) is totally
biased. The only neutral
knowledge is the reading
on a meter, a n d even this
is dependent on the de-
sign of the experiment
and apparatus. W h e n
this reading is written
d o w n it has again gone
via a biased human be-
ing a n d must be viewed
as such. A l s o , experi-
mental results must be
interpreted by the ex-
perimenter in the light
of a theoretical m o d e l ,
and the controversies in
some aspects of science
clearly indicate that i n -
terpretations c a n differ.
Hence the scientist, a l -
though he may like to
believe that all the re-
search he does is in pur-
suit of pure knowledge,
has a definite responsi-
bility to society because
he defines his o w n opin-
ions a n d prejudices with
his results a n d c o n c l u -
sions. A n area of special
concern here is experi-
mental psycology with
respect to intelligence
and race, or environmen-
tal effects on I.Q.
A similar responsibil-
ity lies in the scientist
looking for the scientific
and social effects of his
research. He cannot div-
orce the social effects
from scientific curiosity,
saying that they are not
his concern, because
that is like giving a m a n
a gun a n d d i s c l a i m i n g
responsibility w h e n
someone is shot. Once
these effects are recog-
nised in work that has
been completed then the
scientist must carefully
consider whether or not
to publish the results,
and have the courage to
withhold information a n d
even to drop an entire
piece of research if he
thinks it w i l l be detri-
mental to society at
large. This has broader
implications in the
choice of a job or field
of research — to w e i g h
up the value of the work,
and to refuse to under-
take it if it is harmful to
society at large. Ideally,
every scientist should be
able to fully justiy his
research to the general
public, because it is they
who will have to suffer
its unforeseen conse-
quences.
There are two ways to
ensure that scientists
and technologists bear
the social side of their
work in m i n d . One of
these is to form some
professional body or
council to vet n e w de-
vices a n d techniques be-
fore use; a similar body
to the one mentioned
previously. T h e second,
preferable, method is to
give a training in the
social consequences of
science along with the
training in scientific
method. There are some
University courses along
these lines already (like
the ' S c i e n c e , Technol-
ogy a n d S o c i e t y ' a n d
'Environment a n d M a n '
courses here in I.C.) but
the object s h o u l d be uni-
fied courses in w h i c h
these matters are brought
up as an integral part of
the course. In this way,
scientists will be able to
keep their work in pers-
pective, a n d society w i l l
benefit from it.
There is, however, a
gap in the time scale be-
tween the present time
and the time in the fut-
ure when scientists a n d
technologists have been
educated to be socially
r e s p o n s i b l e — w h a t is to
happen in this period of
intense scientific effort?
Each individual scientist
must take the responsib-
ility on his o w n should-
ers, a n d critically look at
his o w n work a n d that of
others, a n d decide whe-
ther or not it is justified.
If it is not, he must have
the courage to stop, a n d
take his valuable skills
and knowledge to a more
responsible field.
Students, Human
Beings and Halls
of Residence
Sir.—As the editorial
suggests, Derek Cum-
mings' blueprint for ac-
tion certainly needs
some further comment.
He has assumed, first of
all, that the answer to
the student housing
problem is more halls of
residence. Is this in fact
the right answer? Are
student needs such that
they need to live in a
little cube, in the middle
of a hundred other little
cubes, stacked one upon
the other in the mariner
that a child might stack
his first building bricks?
Why is it that the rest of
the population don't cla-
mour to live in a similar
way? Shouldn't students
be treated as people and
given homes instead of
units of accommoda-
tion? I've no doubt that
some students do like
living in little cubes, but
don't we have enough
already. Future student
accommodation should
be designed to cater for
the needs of students
who wish to live, not ex-
ist.
I think students, like
other people, prefer to
live in small groups, but
with other students not
far away. The obvious
answer is some sort of
student village. A flex-
ible design would ensure
that students could live
in groups of two or three
or even groups of up to
ten or twelve. With some
form of community cen-
tre, the village concept
would be complete. I ac-
cept that this type of ac-
commodation would re-
quire slightly more space
than multistorey halls,
but even so a fairly high
density could be achiev-
ed. Students at Surrey
University can vouch for
the fact that living in
such a village is very
pleasant, and if you
doubt that such a system
is practical, I suggest a
visit to Guildford would
change your mind. The
architects of the Surrey
experiment believe that
students are people and
have designed their vil-
lage accordingly. ! sug-
gest it would be worth
inviting the architects to
the Union to explain
their ideas for students
accommodation more
fully than I am able.
Having discussed the
question of whether
more halls are the ans
wer, I feel that the rest
of the article needs some
discussion. Is it so revo-
lutionary to borrow mon-
ey from the banks to pay
for future student ac-
commodation? I was un-
der the impression that
it was Tory government
policy that future stud-
ent accommodation
should be loan financed?
And with interest rates
running at 9 per cent
and rising, the suggested
cost of a hall at £1 mil-
lion per 300 cubes
means that the annual
interest repayment to our
kind benefactors, the
banks, would be at least
£300 per student. Assu-
ming some of this is re-
coverable from confer-
ence lettings, what stud-
ent could afford even
half that amount wnen
account has been taken
of cleaning, electricity,
rates and even capital re-
payment, which would
put the rent even higher.
Of course all forms of
accommodation will cost
us a lot of money and
that is why students
must oppose all forms of
loan financed accommo-
dation, unless grants are
raised to such an extent
that a decent standard
of living can be achieved
without subsidy.
Lastly on the question
of rent strikes. Derek
Cummings thinks tnev
will achieve very little.
He may be right. But I
know that they can ach-
ieve a great deal. At this
time last year, the Uni-
versity of Sussex Ten-
ants Association organis-
ed a little-publicised
rent strike. This was to
oppose plans to build a
totally inadequate loan-
financed hall, but in
place to build accommo-
dation to suit the needs
of the students including
flatlets to enable couples
to live together if they
so wish. This rent strike
was supported by about
90 per cent of the ten-
ants and after a couple
of months of threats, the
administration agreed
that halls were not what
the students wanted, but
what the conference or-
ganisers wanted. This
raised the question of
whether accommodation
would be built to suit the
needs of students or con-
ferences. The rent strike
was successful, and now
no new hall will be built.
Instead there will be
more suitable homes for
students. Remember, a
hall for 300 students is
not just 300 little cubes.
Assuming a hall lasts
100 years, it will have
positively affected 30
thousand students' lives.
JOHN PORTER.
Halls am
Wages
Sir—How naive is our
president? I refer to his
droolings in President's
Column in the Christmas
edition of "Felix". He as-
certains that since col-
lege may be serving re-
dundancies to cleaners,
the money college saves
should be reflected in a
decrease in our hall fees.
Surely college is only
planning to reduce the
cleaner staff in order to
keep our hall bills
stable? The cleaner staff
is excessively large any-
way: who needs their
rooms cleaned every
day?
If trade unionists stop-
ped fighting for, and ob-
taining, large wage in-
creases, then hall bills
would not go up.
One man's wage in-
crease is another's price
increase.

Dear Oily,
W h a t are you going to
do about all those herds
of c o w s that have arriv-
ed in m y office?
Yours,

Our Guildford corres-
pondent w o u l d like to ex-
press a personal opinion
on this article. Firstly,
does M r . Porter believe
that the halls of resi-
dence at Surrey are not
'little c u b e s ' ? Does he,
furthermore, believe that
they are attractive? I
have frequently heard
them referred to by vari-
ous names, ranging from
'beehives' to ' d o l l s ' hou-
s e s ' — a n d these names
are not only conferred
by G u i l d f o r d residents,
but also by the students
themselves. Personally, I
w o u l d rather live in an
I.C. Hall, than in the
Surrey complex. I s y m -
pathise with the concept,
but please choose a n -
other example!
(By the w a y , does M r .
Porter know that Surrey
is at present on a Rent
Strike?)
