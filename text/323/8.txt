Surrey succeed
with 60%
support
More to Grants Campaign
than Rent Strikes
The students at Surrey University are at present
running one of the most successful rent strikes i n the
country. After one tenn they were able to report 6 0 %
support for their strike—that is, 60% of all students at
Surrey had paid into the Rent Fund. £44,250 had been
collected from 950 residents by 13th December, 1972.
Iln fact, support for the strike is even greater than this,
as less than 20% of students have paid the University.
A n d it should be remembered that, as rents are paid on
a termly basis at Surrey, the Rent Fund could con-
ceivably double as this term progresses.
When I asked M e l
Ingram (President of the
Students' Union) and Iain
Morrison (Chairman of
the Rent Action Commit-
tee) the reason for their
success at Surrey, their
answer was simple; hard
work, and careful organ-
isation. When the rent
strike started it was neces-
sary to educate the mass
of students as to the issues
involved. Newsheets were
(and are still being) print-
ed regularly. Posters were
designed and displayed all
over the University. Pick-
ets were appointed to
stand outside the Cashier's
Office (where students
would normally pay their
rents) to attempt to per-
suade them to pay into the
Rent F u n d instead. A
videofilm was made show-
ing U n i o n officials trying
to negotiate with Univer-
sity Authorities. V o l u n -
teers were found t o distri-
bute leaflets. A n d , prob-
ably most important of all,
a door-to-door survey was
undertaken to discover
the extent of support, and
to try to persuade those
who had not yet paid any-
one to pay into the Rent
Fund. This was a mam-
moth task, as it involved
knocking o n 1,600 doors,
but it had positive results
in that 77 more students
paid after they had been
visited personally.
One more factor which
has been of great assist-
ance to the strike organ-
isers is that Surrey is a
Campus University. This
has obviously helped, es-
pecially as far as com-
munication is concerned,
but it has not meant that
non-residents have not
been involved i n the strug-
gle. Non-residents are, in
fact, attending Union
General Meetings (at the
rate of two a week!) and
have been giving the
strikers all possible sup-
port.
A t the beginning of the
Surrey strike a Rent Fund
Constitution was drawn
up which has been rigidly
adhered to. This lays
down the only uses to
which the money c a n be
put to pay the University
in the event of the strike
being settled, or to reim-
burse any person who
wishes to withdraw his
contribution. It also states
that the F u n d shall be
open to inspection by any
member of the Union, and
that accounts should be
presented to a General
Meeting at least once
every two weeks. It is
worth noting that on aver-
age Surrey is holding Gen-
eral Meetings twice a
week at the moment, and
that these Meetings con-
tinue to be quorate.
N o w Surrey is trying to
identify its local efforts
with the national Gramts
campaign. Members of
the University are visiting
other Colleges to give
them the benefit of their
v a l u a b 1 e experience.
Speakers have already
been sent to H u l l , Keele,
Aston, Birmingham, Read-
ing and Bath. Surrey U n i -
versity has been successful
so far. It remains to be
seen how many other U n i -
versities Will be able t o
drum up sufficient enthus-
iasm to follow i n their
footsteps.
Only sixteen
at C.C. C.
O n the 16th December 1972 the Campaign Co-ord-
inating Committee met at U . L . U . (University of L o n d o n
Union) to discuss the probable outline of the Grants
Campaign as it could take place this term. Digby Jacks
(President N.U.S.) presented a paper to the C.C.C.
which divided the campaign into 4 phases.
The first phase has al-
ready started, and includes
the rent strikes which have
been taking place i n the
last term, for example at
Surrey, Keele and Exeter.
Phase 2 will begin to-
wards the end of lanuary.
It will involve activity by
students on the three pri-
orities of the grants cam-
paign: the main rate of
g r a n t s , discretionary
awards and married
women students' grants.
The activity envisaged in-
cludes not only rent
strikes a n d catering boy-
cotts, but also lobbying of
M.P.s a n d , possibly, of
L o c a l Education Author-
ities. Such action should
be organised on a local
basis.
Phase 3 should take
place i n m i d February.
This is to be a unified
national campaign. It is
hoped that 3 or 4 regional
demonstrations can be
organised, i n such places
as London, Cardiff, E d i n -
burgh and Birmingham,
although the venues are,
as yet, provisional. Such
demonstrations w o u Id
show the unity of and
mass support for the cam-
paign. Wednesday, 21st
February has been sug-
gested as a possible date
for this.
The campaign would
reach a climax with phase
4, towards the end of this
term. If previous support
has been sufficient either
a national D a y of A c t i o n
or a national strike will be
called i n m i d M a r c h .
These then were the
proposals put b y the
N.U.S. Executive (in the
shape of Digby Jacks) to
a C.C.C. which consisted
of predisely 16 members.
It seems incredible that
there were not more
people present at a meet-
ing which h a d to decide
matters of great impor-
tance to the grants cam-
paign. One could not help
feeling that i f this was
representative of support
for the campaign, the
N.U.S. will not have to
organise that national
strike i n M a r c h .

A s was reported briefly i n the 5th December issue of
" F e l i x " , the N U S National Conference at Margate i n
November passed a large a n d comprehensive motion
on Grants. It called for a n immediate increase i n the
mandatory rate of grant to cover rises i n the cost of
living since the last award: the N U S Executive is ask-
ing for £65 which would restore the grant to the 1968
settlement level (which restored the 1962 level). Other
major demands were
% an end to discrimina-
tion against married
women students i n
grants assessment (at
present, married women
get £275 p.a. — single
women get £480).
:js the abolition of discre-
tionary awards — and
an especial call for the
designation of the
Higher National Dip-
loma ( H N D ) and other
non-designated advanc-
ed courses. (Explanation
for the uninitiated:
There are designated
and nora-d e si g n a t e d
c o u r s e s . Designated
courses — like degree
courses at Universities
and Polytechnics—carry
with them a mandatory
grant level, which is
paid to a l l students re-
gardless. Students on
non-designated courses
like courses at A r t Col-
leges, F . E . Colleges, etc.)
have their grant decid-
ed upon by their L o c a l
Authority, who use their
discretion to decide how
much, if anything, they
will pay.)
% the grant must be
enough to pay the full
economic cost of stu-
dents' catering resi-
dence.
grants should be revised
annually o n a "Student
Costs Index".
there should be a
"threshold agreement",
such that any upward
movement on the Stu-
dent Costs Index be-
yond an agreed percent-
age during the period
between reviews should
result i n an automatic
interim increase i n the
level of grants.
jfc the notional element i n
the grant allowed for
vacation maintenance
should be disallowed i n
the assessment of Social
Security payments.
sfc National Insurance con-
tributions should be
paid for a l l students
while i n full-time educa-
tion.
* grants for courses of
duration greater than
30 weeks should i n -
clude one-thirtieth of
It'he full grant for each
week the course lasts
in excess of 30.
sfc U K students studying
abroad should have
their grant levels adjust-
ed to make provision
for the changes i n ex-
change rates since 1967,
when they were last
fixed.
Conference agreed not
to press for a student wage
instead of a grant for the
time being, until a l l stu-
dents had been informed
of the issues involved i n
this demand and the ad-
vantages that might
accrue. A publicity drive
to gain support amongst
students for this concept
is to start shortly.
The national Rent
Strike is planned to be a
major springboard of the
campaign for higher
grants. W h e r e Rent
Strikes are impracticable,
Catering Boycotts are
urged.
