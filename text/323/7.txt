Cost-cutting
and shorter courses
White Paper on Education
A jump from 463,000 to 750,000 i n the numbers of
students a n d 2 2 % of eighteen-year-olds i n further edu-
cation are the major aims for higher education set
forth i n the Government White Paper published i n
December*. T h e main expansion would take place i n
the Polytechnics who, the Government hopes, will take
the same number of students as the Universities
(375,000) by 1981. T h e number of part-time students
would increase considerably, but the percentage of
post-graduates would fall from 19% of students to 17%
(an increase in numbers of only 7,000 over the next ten
years).
The White Paper sug-
gests a need for a shorter
course than current first
degree courses, and pro-
poses a 2-year course lead-
ing to a D i p l o m a of
Higher Education (Dip
H E ) . This would be of
comparable difficulty to
the first two years of a
first degree course, could
be offered at both Poly-
technics and Universities,
and would carry a man-
datory grant to students
with it. A considerable
number of students opting
to take the D i p H E i n -
stead of a three-year
course would reduce the
number of places required
in H E institutions, and
thus cut costs. Cutting
costs is a major preoccu-
pation of the White Paper.
Notwithstanding this,
the White Paper contains
proposals to build a fur-
ther 11,000 units of stu-
dent accommodation i n
74/75. Places should be
available for about two-
thirds of the additional
students expected in the
c u r r e n t quinquennium
(1972-77). However, the
White Paper says that "the
Government shares the
frequently-expressed view
that it is unrealistic and
unnecessary for such a
high proportion of stu-
dents to reside and study
at a distance if equally
acceptable courses are
available to them within
daily travelling distance of
their homes" and suggests
that Universities and i n -
stitutions of Advanced
Higher Education should
lay great emphasis on
home-based students.
The Government be-
lieves that since one of the
biggest costs of higher edu-
cation is that of employ-
ing teaching staff, econo-
mies should be made here,
and the staff/student ratio
should be reduced to 10:1.
They suggest that " a gra-
dual transition to this
average figure should be
possible without lowering
Bye, bye, Binary
The Education and Arts sub-committee of the House
of Commons Expenditure Committee published their
report on further and higher education on Wednesday,
December 20th. If accepted, the report would mean
an end to the binary system of financing higher edu-
cation, a n a i m that student organisations have been
fighting for for many years. A t present, the Universities
and Colleges apply for their money from a central body,
the University Grants Committee ( U D G ) , which is
given a certain amount of money by the Government
to dole out amongst the Universities. Polytechnics, C o l -
leges of Education, and other Higher Education insti-
tutions get their money from the L o c a l Authorities.
The Expenditure Report recommends that a l l Higher
and Further Education be brought together under one
financing authority similar to the U G C : a "Higher
Education Commission".
standards".
Recently Mrs. Thatcher,
Secretary of State for
Education, ruled such a
possibility out as "admin-
istratively inpracticable".
But M r . N e i l Marten,
Chairman of the Sub-Com-
mittee, said that were it
solely a n administrative
difficulty it could be over-
come.
Home-based students
The report suggests that
the universities be initially
given a few years to in-
crease the number of
home-based students, and
if they do not succeed the
Government would be
justified in taking tougher
measures. These measures
could include not provid-
ing any more purpose-
built student accommo-
dation, universities not be-
ing allowed to accept stu-
dents from outside their
own region unless they can
guarantee accommodation
in halls of residence or
approved lodgings, giving
priority to students from
difficult home back-
grounds and the expan-
sion of institutions with
large local catchment
areas.
Loans for U/G's rejected
The committee said that
since, were a loan scheme
for undergraduates to be
introduced, it could not be
done without numerous
exceptions and special
cases, it should not be con-
sidered a practicality at
the moment. T h e report
did not, however, entirely
rule out the idea. Although
yet to be fully investigat-
ed, the Committee did sug-
gest that loans for post-
graduates might be a wel-
come scheme.
U C C A extended
The Universities Central
Council on Admissions
( U C C A ) should be ex-
tended to serve all institu-
tions of higher and further
education, suggests the re-
port. A t present, poly-
technics and colleges of
education have to be ap-
plied to separately and
individually.
A National Manpower
Council should be set up
to advise students about
the demand for qualified
manpower. A Careers A d -
visory service for scholars
interests i n going into
higher education should
be included, to tell them
what jobs are offered for
which qualifications.
E n d to Quinquennial
system
A t present universities
work on " T h e Quinquen-
nial P l a n " , i.e. they receive
an allocation of money
every five years for the
next five years' work. T h e
Committee suggests that
instead of this a five-year
rolling plan co-ordinated
with and o n the lines of
the public expenditure
surveys. The committee
expects that expenditure
for three years ahead
could probably be firmly
fixed, and the next two
years reasonably accur-
ately forecasted.

D E P A R T M E N T O F E D U C A T I O N A N D S C I E N C E .
W H I T E H A L L .
I st A p r i l 1974
M y dear Edward,
A s you are aware we at the D.E.S. have long been troubled by the activities
of a small group of your subjects. I refer of course to the students at present
attending the Universities.
I a m therefore delighted to inform you of the details of the White Paper we
are to publish next month entitled 'In Place of Struggle'.
The Paper outlines the new structure of degree courses as from next Sep-
tember. T h e basic principle behind the scheme is to give students their long
awaited parity — financial and otherwise — with their peers in industry and
offices.
Financial parity is achieved b y paying the students a salary of between
£20-£25 per week o n a sliding scale according to age.
Students will attend lectures for 40 hours per week and be given the usual
3 weeks annual holiday. This will result in the same amount of time being
allotted to lectures and tutorials as under the present system of a 3 year
degree course. However, this scheme is based on one year's study to an
honours degree.
I a m advised b y my colleagues i n the Treasury that this could result in
either a cut of 5 0 % on higher education spending, or a rise of 100% i n the
number of graduates—I know which one you will prefer Tel !
Too good to be true, y o u say, but will public opinion allow us to pass the
Bill? Never fear, after last year's rash of student rent strikes and militancy,
public opinion has never been more solidly behind us i n our struggle against
the student.
Hoping the above meets with your approval,
I remain your humble servant,
Maggie.
The author would like to state that the figures quoted i n this letter are quite
realistic.

'This royal throne of kings, this sceptred isle,
This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,
This other Eden, demi-paradise,
This fortress built by nature for herself
Against infection and the hand of war,
This happy breed of men, this little world,
This precious stone set in the silver sea,
Which serves it in the office of a wall,
Or as a moat defensive to a house,
Against the envy of less happier lands.
This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England.'
(Richard II)
