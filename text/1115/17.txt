THE ICA AND WHY YOU SHOULD GO THERE

irst of all, a couple of things
need to be cleared up. W h e n
1 tell people I went to the ICA,
most of them are convinced it has
something to d o with our beloved
college, a club or association of
some sort. Absolutely not. ICA
stands for the Institute of
Contemporary Arts, and it happens
to be one of the most exciting and
innovative places in L o n d o n . All art
lovers can find their preferred form
here: exhibitions, cinema, perfor-
mance arts, conferences, club
nights and a brand new m e d i a cen-
tre. There a two exhibitions worth
writing about on right now, both
until 24 M a y .
The first and biggest one is
"Future Systems", a group of seven
designers showing recent projects.
These people are being tipped as
the creators of 21st century land-
scape. Some of the projects have
already been finished: the Nat West
media centre at Lord's Cricket
Ground, North L o n d o n and a c o u -
ple of schools in Britain a n d
Germany. The exhibition itself is
really well set out. O n e goes round
| | p p i M H r i « d p g a f f i t each pro-
ject, complimented with pictures.
Then one tlirns to the middle of the
room to firfd two big tables with all
the m o d e l s ! It is fascinating looking
at these. The whole Idea of Future
Systems Is |o create buildings that
are energy generating, non-pollut-
ing with exciting new shapes. Some
of these tdtally melt into land-
scape, such as the house in Wales;
others clash with the environment,
such as the Ark building at the Earth
Centre. But all have an "organic"
look to them. They also have the
idea of dividing one building into
several smaller ones: the "Green
Bird" is, depending on where one
stands, either a block of flats or a
set of offices. Other projects
include the zero emission develop-
ments funded by the European
C o m m i s s i o n of the cities of Berlin,
Toulouse and L o n d o n . In the c o m -
ments for the models, one sen-
tence seems to s u m up their way of
working: "What our communities
d e m a n d from us today is a new
humanity and architecture. A
nature and an enhanced quality of
life and on architecture that is soft
and organic, to enclose the energy
efficient non polluting technologies
of the 21 st century." This exhibition
is the opportunity for people like us
to see and appreciate our future
environment. If this is what it's
going to be like, then I can't wait to
be there.
J The next exhibition is by Sarah
Sze. I will confess that most people
will find this just pretentious and
useless. M i s s Sze has put together
all sorts of everyday objects (cans,
pencils..) and stuck them all over
the ceiling and d o w n some of the
walls of the upper gallery. It's
extremely amusing and quite fasci-
nating looking at the rows of pen-
cils s u d d e n l y interrupted by a
matchbox. The colours brighten up
the r o o m and the whole installation
is a celebration of our daily life
showing the ups and downs of it. If
you have time to spare, this is def-
initely one of the nicest way to
spend it.
Finally a w o r d about the events
of the ICA this month. A s usual,
there is some amazing stuff o n . At
the cinema, there is a retrospect
of Lars V o n Trier's work, (Breaking
the Waves), one of the most
exceptional directors working In
Europe. There are also some very
interesting talks including one by
Steven Berkoff, and another about
the emergence of Asian Culture in
Britain. The ICA has recently
o p e n e d a new media centre with
lots of fun things to watch a n d
touch. If y o u have never been to
the ICA, I urge you to go there right
now. For more information, Felix
has the programmes of events, just
go into the office and ask Julia.
Watch this space-over the next few
weeks for more about the cutting
edge art in L o n d o n .

efore reviewing this exhibi-
tion, 1 a m ashamed to admit
my relative ignorance with
respect to this fascinating artist.
Despite the impressive credentials
of his career, the reclusive Kapoor
remains distant from the limelight
of success and m e d i a attention.
Born in India of Iraqi and Hindi
parentage, this talented British
sculptor rose to fame during the
80s. Representing the nation at the
prestigious Venice Biennale of
1990, he gained further acclaim
when awarded the controversial
Turner prize in 1991. Bluffer's tip: a
pair of coveted pieces even adorns
the reverent hallway of 10 D o w n i n g
Street.
The current solo event, a singu-
lar achievement and honour at the
tender age of 44, comprises sur-
prisingly recent works, including
several especially c o m m i s s i o n e d
sculptures integrated into the
gallery's interior structure. Kapoor
explores the disturbing interaction
between space and void - elliptical
swellings extend the confinements
of rigid walls, funnels plunge the
observer into the infinite oblivion of
shadows, mirrored lenses distort
the conventional order of images.
Regardless of the sexual connota-
tions invariably associated with the
sensual cavities and sinuous
curves, the ambitious collection is
primarily a spellbinding journey
through an abstract wonderland.
The extraordinary scale of his work
is highlighted by "At the Edge of the
World II", an engulfing c r i m s o n
d o m e of gargantuan proportions,
which towers d o w n from the ceiling
and measures an a w e - i n s p i r i n g
eight metres in diameter.
Often considered his stylistic
trademark, the m o n o c h r o m e p o w -
dered pigment vibrates with tex-
ture, bringing the walls and sur-
roundings explosively to life.
Exploiting the qualities of diverse
materials, such as carved natural
w o o d , traditional polished stone,
m o u l d e d translucent alabaster and
versatile fibreglass, the sculptor
creates an enigmatic depth verging
on the boundary of optical illusion.
Unravelling the mysterious dimen-
sions and puzzling forms is a visual
challenge, straining the senses and
overwhelming the mind.
Verdict: this important exhibi-
tion is both an enlightening and
uplifting experience, possibly the
most exciting and innovative work
in London at the m o m e n t .
