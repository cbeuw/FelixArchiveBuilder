DEEP IMPACT
Starring: Robert Duvall, Elijah W o o d , M o r g a n Freeman
Director: M i m i Leder * * * V2
Thank God â€¢ the Americans are here to rescue us once again
I
t may sound like a porn film but
Deep Impact is actually the first
of a pair of M e f e o r style s u m -
mer blockbusters. Scientists have
discovered that there is a comet on
a collision course with Earth which
is so massive that its impact will
cause an "ELE", an Extinction Level
Event. In other words, humanity is
going to disappear unless America,
led by President M o r g a n Freeman,
can d o something about it.
Fortunately, the film is not as
mindless as the synopsis would
have us believe. Sure, there's plen-
ty of action as Robert Duvall flies a
squad of nuclear missile-wielding
astronauts toward the comet's sur-
face in an attempt to blow it off
course, but just as m u c h screen
time is devoted to how various indi-
viduals react to their impending
deaths.
In the event of Duvall failing, the
US government has randomly
selected one million people to live
in a secure underground "Ark" for
two years, after which they will be
the foundation of a new civilisation.
Naturally, the other five billion peo-
ple on the planet are a bit disap-
pointed at not being chosen and
Deep Impact frequently focuses on
their reaction.
Surprisingly it is these ancillary
scenes that reduce the impact of
the film. The director has clearly
attempted to develop characters
far more than in the usual disaster
movie but has failed due to the
casting. The ubiquitous romance in
the form of t w o lovesick pre-
pubescent teenagers is unlikely to
appeal to any of the audience while
most other characters are far too
stereotypical. It is only the little-
used Freeman w h o performs with
any panache, and as a result one
just sits back and waits for the
inevitable special effects to begin.
W h e n they d o arrive, and the
budget kicks in, they alone justify
the price of the ticket - the sight of
a three kilometre high tidal wave
travelling at faster than the speed of
sound will have y o u at the edge of
your seat. Consequently, whist aim-
ing at something deeper are more
meaningful than your average big
budget rollercoaster, once again its
only the effects that are notable.
Thus, its unlikely to better the year's
other inbound c o m e t caper -
Armageddon - which is (very delib-
erately) just as mindless as its
sounds.
Despite Deep Impact's g o o d
intentions, it will probably only be
remembered for having the most
outrageous special effects in
history. At least until Godzilla. O

SLIDING DOORS
Starring: Gwyneth Paltrow, John Hannah, John Lynch
Director: Peter Howitt * * * *
E
x a m s getting y o u d o w n ?
Wall-to-wall revision proving
all too much? Relax take a
break, and take in one of the most
innovative romantic c o m e d i e s
released for a long time.
Gwyneth Paltrow, sporting a
surprisingly c o n v i n c i n g L o n d o n
accent, leads as a sacked advertis-
ing exec w h o returns h o m e to find
her boyfriend in bed with another
w o m a n . Or she doesn't. You see,
the neat trick about which the film
revolves is that her entire life
depends o n whether or not she
catches the tube, or is just too late
to beat the titular "Sliding Doors".
In Reality O n e , she returns
home early, meets charming, witty
John Hannah (the gay, Scottish guy
in Four Weddings) on the tube and
catches her boyfriend, John Lynch,
at it with his ex. O n Hannah's
advice she starts a new life, sets-up
her o w n c o m p a n y and surprise sur-
prise falls in love. In reality two, she
misses the tube, returns home later
in the day, sticks with Lynch and
ends up taking waitressing jobs.
OK, so it's soppy, slushy and
occasionally sickeningly romantic,
but then what were you expecting?
The important point is that this isn't
film making by numbers. There's no
sign of the standard plotting ahd
characterisation w h i c h usually
accompanies the words "starring
M e g Ryan". The characters are
fleshed out, and if at the end of the
day the likelihood of bumping into
your ideal partner on a tube might
seem utterly unbelievable, the plot
is still involved enough to grip your
attention through to the final
minute.
Sadly, however, a promising
concept proves difficult to film.
Although director H o w i t t uses
some nice touches to cut between
the two storylines, the ending in
particular is unsatisfactory and
rushed. Indeed, y o u could be for-
given for leaving the cinema feeling
that what started out so promising-
ly has simply been thrown away.
The acting too leaps from spot
on, particularly from Hannah - w h o
is a natural romantic lead - to
appallingly stereotypical, with the
main culprit Jeanne Tripplehorn as
"the other w o m a n " . Fortunately,
the film focuses on Paltrow and
Hannah, w h o manage to achieve a
rarely seen level of chemistry and
believablilty. This allows Paltrow to
show that she really does have the
talent (and the requisite endearing
smile) to carve out a future as a
romantic lead.
Funny, romantic and heart-
warming, Sliding Doors is a noble
attempt to make something tradi-
tional yet original. A nineties take
on romantic c o m e d y a la sixties
Cary Grant, it is ultimately flawed.
Yet the imaginative touches shown
by both director and cast mark it
out as head and shoulders above
the competition. Q
