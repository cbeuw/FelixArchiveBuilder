WAR HAMMER : DARK OMEN
Electronic Arts - Playstaion / PC * * * *
I did start to like M y t h s , I honestly
did, after battling with the controls
and g r o u p i n g c o m m a n d w h i c h
took ages to master, the poor A l
which meant you had to tell your
archers to stop shooting at your
own side - it was starting to g r o w
on me. Then along c a m e Dark
O m e n to show it to the door. Dark
O m e n has poorer graphics than
Myths and its not as pleasing to
the ear either, but its everything
myths should have been - a m u c h
better game.
It is a fantasy battle g a m e in
which y o u play the leader of a mer-
cenary troop w h o is helping out
the local king. You c o m m a n d units
such as infantry, archers, cross-
b o w m e n , assorted d w a r v e n , elf
troops and magic users against
ores, goblins and living d e a d .
The major difference between
Myths and Dark O m e n in terms of
units is the inclusion of cannon,
cavalry, and offensive magic. The
opportunity of horse led charges,
long range artillery bombardments
and wizard fireballs coupled with
the ability to quickly select and
move units creates a more positive
feel on the battlefield. There is also
a quick and simple way of selecting
and positioning units that are cur-
rently off screen - all is needed
now is to click o n the shield repre-
senting the unit o n the side of the
screen.
It's only a shame that the A l is
not all that intelligent. The archers,
cannon and wizards all have a
unnerving ability to wipe out half of
a infantry regiment if y o u send
them in to attack the enemy unit
targeted. Also, unless y o u are care-
ful y o u can select a regiment to
attack an enemy unit then order it
to charge, only to watch it hurtle
away from the enemy because
you have not ordered to face in the
correct direction.
Annoying glitches aside it is the
best of the fantasy battle games
even if it features a unit that looks
remarkably like a tank.

G A M I N G N E W S
Resident Evil 2 finally arrived in the
UK last w e e k e n d , shifting over
6 0 , 0 0 0 copies in the first five days
alone. This easily makes it the
fastest-selling Playstation g a m e of
all time, beating the previous
record holder T o m b Raider 2,
which sold 5 2 , 0 0 0 in its first week.
Unsurprising, then, that videogame
producers are so keen on sequels.
Sega will officially announce its
next c o n s o l e o n M a y 21st.
C o d e n a m e d 'Katana' (final name
still to be revealed, but unlikely to
be Saturn 2) this could be Sega's
last chance to claw back a share of
the console market from Sony and
Nintendo. Allegedly 10-12 games
will be available at launch, some-
time in 1999.
Although Playstation o w n e r s
w o u l d probably give their right
arms to have a c o n v e r s i o n of
ColdenEye, they will instead be
treated to Tomorrow Never Dies,
in production at Black O p s and
M G M Interactive. S o m e h o w I don't
think it will quite measure up to the
hit Nintendo 64 game.
A n d finally, as if one dual ana-
logue joypad wasn't enough, Sony
has released the Dual Shock
Analogue Pad which has twin ana-
logue joypads. However, it also
includes a 'shock' feature which
allows a g a m e to transmit some of
the o n s c r e e n physical violence
back to y o u . The new pad coin-
cides with the European release of
Gran Turisimo.

Emulation
Two years ago the early versions of
arcade g a m e emulators started to
appear for the PC. Space invaders
and pacman and for free, it truly
was a generous world. Suddenly it
was 1982 all over again; the bright
flashing screens and loud sounds
came flooding back. In those early
releases there were only about ten
or so games supported and they
had a nasty tendency to suddenly
display w e i r d c o l o u r e d sprites.
Two years though is a technologi-
cal lifetime away, PC's and more
importantly the emulation scene
has matured out. The o l d emulator
scene is one for the history books;
long live the reliable 16-bit console
and arcade emulators. First the 16
bit game emulators. Before the
Saturn and Playstation there were
the Megadrive and S N E S . Both
triggered a resurgence in home
game machines and quality soft-
ware.
But these were h o m e
machines. The arcade machines
were out of reach for all except a
chosen few. N o w allowing y o u
have the roms most of the arcade
games of the I980's can be played
on the PC and it's a d a m n site eas-
ier to change between g a m e s
c o m p a r e d with swapping arcade
motherboards. The big question
though is what emulator will run
the g a m e you want it to. M a m e
(Multi-Arcade M a c h i n e Emulator)
is one of the oldest and best-sup-
ported arcade emulators. It runs
well o n a low end Pentium (and
even on some old 486's) though
for s o m e of the later supported
games a better Pentium with some
m e m o r y will give better frame
rates. M a m e is one of simplest
emulators to use, with a specific
Windows95/NT port which when
run searches for the appropriate
Roms. Though it generally runs the
older arcade roms, Space invaders,
Pacman, and Donkey Kong and its
clones, it also can run many of the
mid 80's arcade roms such as
C o m m a n d o , M a r b l e M a d n e s s ,
Arkanoid and Tetris. It is also able
to run the Atari vector based
games Asteroids, battlezone and
star wars. With about 4 5 0 + possi-
ble games it would take ages to get
bored with this. M a m e starts to run
out of steam when it c o m e s to
covering later 80's arcade games.
For these games there are still
emulators but these tend to be dos
rather than w i n d o w s based. Also
because of the later 80's idea of
running different arcade games on
the same motherboard most of
these emulators deal with a family
of games. Callus the C a p c o m e m u -
lator a n d System 16, the Sega
system 16 emulator, are g o o d
examples of these. Both are well
built emulators and run roms such
as super hang-on and outrun, but
can be very very slow. A fast
Pentium or Pentium2 system and
the frame rate will improve. Also
should y o u want to run the best
ever arcade shoot-em-up R-type
(read last months Edge just to see
its not just my opinion) the emula-
tor to o w n is RAGE (Real Arcade
G a m e Emulator). Unfortunately it is
processor hungry, the hint is to run
it under pure dos m o d e , but is
almost worth buying a pentium2
system just to increase the frame
rate. So h o w d o you get hold of
these emulators (and the roms - if
you o w n them). Well one of the
better sites is Dave's Videogame
Classics (http://www.davesclas-
s i c s . c o m ) , this practically is a
one-stop shop for emulators. So
relive your early days and relive
those classics.
