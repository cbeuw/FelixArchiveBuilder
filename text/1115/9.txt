THE UNBELIEVABLE TRUTH
Almost Here [QQ]
I
t's quite shocking that
Unbelievable Truth actually grab
your attention and manage to
hold onto it. More often than not,
bands like this tend to drag on and
become repetitively boring, leaving
you pondering where you left last
week's Melody Maker. Almost
Here is an inspirational debut
release that guides you through the
darkness and promises a light at
the end of the tunnel. Named after
Hal Hartley's 1990 quirky, offbeat
cult picture, they transmit an inten-
sity of atmosphere that is hard not
to fall in love with. Andy Yorke
(brother of Thorn, if you didn't
know) has a strong voice which is
captivating, almost hypnotising.
Magical chords float in, through,
round and out of the gorgeously
soaring melodies. The fragile, care-
fully balanced sound is unique and
cosily familiar.
Right from the start, the songs
are constructed with a base of
thought-provoking lyrics and sim-
ple yet rich acoustic tunes, only to
go off in a direction of their own.
Opener and current single. Solved
manages to convey the frustration
of a given problem in a grand and
epic manner. You're pulled in by
the sweeping sympathetic vocals,
'And it's all I've got and it's not
enough.' The following track,
Angel, builds and rises to the end
where it gloriously pulls all its ele-
ments together and the estranged
lyric, 'If you're gonna live your life
like that, it's gonna let you down,'
fights against the powerful strum-
ming and majestic strings. In fact,
there are many climactic lyrics that
are repeated at the end of a song,
in order to leave a lasting impres-
sion: 'Settle down, you never want
to see me drown.' (Settle Down);
'Say what you want. Deliverance
can wait.' (Building) and the album
closing, Be ready to go.' (Be
Ready)
This review may come across
as an exercise in hyperbole, but
Unbelievable Truth deserve all the
credit they get. Almost Here is an
entirely engaging and intimate
affair. It's beautifully performed,
intelligently crafted, gloriously
inspirational, emotionally uplifting
and without parallel. Unbelievably
special and that's the truth.H

Arr yoi gaat ah loit, boy? Arr yoi
gaat a loooit?
W
ell after reviewing the
Mafia's last dreary single,
Long As I Can See The
Light, I thought the title of the
album was very appropriate. What
I expected was more of the same
slow, dull tunes may-be with a few
nice wizzy effects and uninspired
female vocals. With an ungodly
fear of what I might have let myself
in for I put the CD in the player and
pressed play.
The first track, Make jah Music
is lyrically an ode to reggae and
West Indian music, a theme con-
tinued throughout the album, with
heavy beats, sliding strings and
every kind of electro noise spring-
ing out at you. Not bad but at over
seven minutes long a bit taxing.
Make jah Music sweeps seamless-
ly into Blow the Whole joint Up.
This is on another level altogether,
a distant male voice asks all and
sundry if they are 'ready' in typical
jungle MC style and then it lands
on you like a 4001b jerry Springer
guest, the phattest electro beats
this side of the Chemical Brothers.
Awesome.
Shoot the Boss is a fluid, flow-
ing landscape. At some points you
feel as if you are travelling the most
intense white water ride ever, may-
hem going on all around you and at
other times all you can hear is the
stars twinkling in the inky blue night
sky. The twelve tracks on the album
can be split into those based
around vocals and the instrumental
ones, even if they do tend to have
sampled vocals interweaved into
their very fabric. The true vocal
tracks tend to detract from Jon
Carter's magnificent ability to cob-
ble together a corking tune. Work
Mi Body is testament to this. The
version on the album is a scathing
scratch mix courtesy of DJ Krash
Slaughta with much of Patra's orig-
inal lyrics removed but those that
still remain just annoy and drag the
feeling of the tune down. The
instrumental tracks tend to be
small excursions of their own. The
Whore of Babylon starts off with a
slow introduction into Arabic tribal
beats and builds relentlessly during
its eight and a half minute play time
into a hectic crashing drum n' bass
number.
Shoot the Boss is a brilliant
album, fused images of the
Prodigy, Daft Punk and the
Chemical Brothers all come togeth-
er under one stoned, Jamaican
influenced Boss. Well done Jon
Carter. CI

The Things We Make • •
The band are the NME's current
wunderkind, described by them as
something along the lines of
experimental post-punk power
rock, I'd describe them as some-
thing completely different - fairly
non-descript, keyboard driven
sonic soundscapes (with 'wibbly'
bits) which add more guitary bits
the more you go through the
album. In fact, I might even chance
a comparison to a blander Pink
Floyd at times meaning a lot of
long (6 - 8 minute) songs mostly. It
is quite pleasant at times and as
the tracks progress and you get
more input from the bass and gui-
tars the album certainly improves
with the subtle build up of 'motion'.
This gradual evolution of the album
gives the impression of a concept
album of sorts and this makes for
good background music, being
rather passive on the whole.
There's no teal instant hook to the
album and the gradual build-up to
the climax is too gradual - more
climbing a small hill than a moun-
tain. The best indication is probably
to listen to the latest single,
Candlelight, which is fairly good and
is currently going down well(ish)
with the punters. The album is more
of the same. El
