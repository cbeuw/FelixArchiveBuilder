More on Jeffery Archer
DAVID ROBERTS
Despite a turnout representing only a third of
registered electors, a massive majority
endorsed the creation of an elected mayor for
London in last Thursday's referendum.
Londoners voted three-to-one in favour of
the Government's plans to introduce a city-wide
authority, h e a d e d by a directly elected,
Presidential-style mayor.
This result, the o u t c o m e of which has been
almost certain since the Government's plans for
London government were announced in M a r c h ,
now triggers off the official race for the title, the
elections for which are likely to take place in the
summer of next year. However, in the months
leading up to the referendum, the main c o n -
tenders have already m a d e themselves known.
Jeffery Archer (now Lord Archer of Western-
Super-Mare) and Ken Livingstone have already
thrown their hats into the ring, although both
will have to fight hard to win the backing of their
parties.
The Tories have promised a 'one member
one vote' selection process, with William Hague
refusing to endorse any of the likely candidates.
This could well benefit M r Archer, w h o has been
spending millions courting his party's grass-

roots. M r Livingstone, however, faces a more
up-hill struggle. Although the former leader of
the Greater London Council is undeniably popu-
lar with both the Labour membership and the
electorate, his party's high-command is likely to
rule him out as a contender. They fear his social-
ist policies could undo their ' N e w Labour' image
shift, with M r Livingstone already committing
himself to swingeing taxes on fat cat directors,
including what he described as a "Cedric Brown
greedy bastard rate". Instead, a more 'Blairite'
candidate is anticipated, with Chris Smith
(Culture Secretary) and Frank Dobson (Health
Secretary) the current favourites.
Importantly, both ' R e d ' Ken and 'Gobshite'
Archer have refused to stand if they d o not
receive their respective parties endorsements.
Consequently, the search is o n for an indepen-
dent candidate, from outside the C o m m o n s
mainstream, w h o will bring both fresh-air and
business a c u m e n to the role. Richard Branson
has been touted by many, and frequently tops
opinion polls, thanks to his combination of con-
tinuing business success and man-of-the people
image. However, he is refusing to c o m m i t him-
self, as he says he cannot divert himself from his
interests at present.
In all likelihood, w e will therefore see two
very similar candidates standing, with very simi-
lar manifesto c o m m i t m e n t s , only separated by
the colour of their rosettes.
