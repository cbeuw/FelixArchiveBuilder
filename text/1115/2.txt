White Star to
become Black Hole?
JONATHAN TROUT
A u s t r a l i a n
astronomers may
be w i t n e s s i n g
something that has
never been seen
before; the birth of
a black hole from
the collapsing core
of a super-massive
star.
A spectacular
fireball in the nearby
ESO 184-82 galaxy is
being studied at the
M o u n t S t r o m l o
Observatory near
Canberra, after an
Italian / Dutch o w n e d
satellite picked up an
enigmatic ' g a m m a -
ray burster1
- an enormous blast of
g a m m a rays that appear at random
onds. They are a possible signal for
the birth of a black hole. NASA
a n n o u n c e d that
the G R B 9 7 1 2 1 4
observed in
D e c e m b e r 1997
w a s the " m o s t
powerful explosion
since the Big
Bang", but this lat-
est event, GRB
9 8 0 4 2 5 , could end
up to be even more
powerful. It is
almost certain that
the creation of the
black hole and the
sight of the super-
nova are manifes-
tations of the same
Galaxy ESO 184-82 is the
"smudge" at the centre of
the picture; the bright spot
in the galaxy is the super-
nova of a star approxi-
mately 100 times more
massive than our sun.

makes it so special
is that the explosion is a 'mere' 100
million light years away, allowing
and usually last for only a few sec- unprecedented study access.
LS Editor Resigns
JEREMY THOMSON
The editor of London Student -
the cross-campus newspaper
produced by the University of
London Union - has resigned
under considerable financial
pressure.
John Handelaar, w h o had been
on unpaid leave for over a month,
received a letter from the U L U
council G M C , stating that unless he
could prove otherwise, L o n d o n
Student was broke and his wages
would be stopped. H e responded
shortly before the deadline given in
the G M C ultimatum, tendering his
resignation.
L o n d o n Student's financial
problems were s e e d e d at the
beginning of the year, w h e n
Handelaar failed to secure a c o n -
tract with an advertising agency to
guarantee revenue for the newspa-
per. C o u p l e d with an ambitious
new weekly full-colour format, this
caused serious cash flow prob-
lems. By the spring term, a c o n -
tract had been signed with agents
Marot & C o , but failed to bring in
as m u c h revenue as h o p e d . The
problem was worsened by the edi-
tor's failure to invoice customers,
eventually leading to bankruptcy
for the publication. Jo Paice, Vice
President for Finance and Services
at U L U , claimed that Handelaar
was "very late with invoicing, which
was w h y the situation got so bad
so quickly." L o n d o n Student's edi-
tor elect, T o m Belton, also claimed
that John had "ballsed u p " the
advertising and left the newspaper
with just 9 7 p in the bank.
The reasons for John's absence
are not clear. Jo Paice claimed to
"have no idea" w h y he was away,
though c o n c e d e d that they could
have missed each other. However
Tom Belton, attempting to visit last
week, found "the lights off and a
padlock on the door."
It is highly unlikely that any
more issues of the paper will be
published this year. The most
recent copy is dated 20 M a r c h and
is available only on the web site as
printing was blocked by U L U due to
the cost. However, John Handelaar
has apparently offered to 'help out'
with any further attempts to pub-
lish the L o n d o n Student, and with
the annual U L U handbook, the
ESG. In reality, this job may well be
undertaken by Rob Clark, ICU's
D e p u t y President (Finance and
Services), elected to replace Jo
Paice next academic year.
John Handelaar is twenty-two.
News in Brief...
SUMMER BALL
SOLD OUT
All of the 1 150 tickets for the
summer ball have been sold this
week as students flocked to beat
the deadline. Sales peaked at over
two hundred places per day on
Tuesday this week as the organis-
ers held an emergency meeting to
try to increase capacity. " W e
never expected to sell this many
[tickets]", student organiser Will
Smith told Felix, "there's been a
massive d e m a n d - it's great."
Capacity is officially set at 2 0 0 0 ,
but the addition of d o d g e m s and
a laser quest and limiting seating
to ten per table has brought the
total d o w n .
The committee were also able
to confirm the attendance of
Johnny Ball as an after-dinner
speaker.
UNIVERSE '98
Dance music fans have been left
in confusion this m o n t h following
the cancellation of Universe98,
Universe's outdoor music festival
scheduled for 23/24 M a y . The
exact reason for cancellation is
unclear, but could be due to poor
ticket sales. Universe have also
recently been involved in a legal
dispute with the M e a n Fiddler
Organisation, w h o c o - p r o m o t e d
previous years' festivals. The dis-
pute centred around ownership of
the 'Tribal Gathering' name for-
merly used for the festival, and
has n o w been settled by an out of
court payment by Universe.
Universe sources seem to be
confident that the festival will take
place later in the year, although it
may be smaller than the original
two day event and could be held
indoors. Universe has been slow
in producing information concern-
ing the cancellation and ticket
refunds, but any updates will be
reported first by radio 1.

DEATHS IN INDONESIA
from front page
ings in an attempt to stop the
uprising, but failed to prevent a
truck and petrol station from being
set o n fire. T h o u s a n d s m o r e
clashed with police in another
Indonesian city, Yogyakarta, as a
wave of anger against the police
action and President Suharto swept
the country.
The protests have been a regu-
lar occurrence in Indonesia over
the last three months, following the
collapse of the rupiah and the eco-
nomic decline of South-East Asia
over the last year. This is, howev-
er, the first time that lethal force
has been against the protests. O n
previous occasions the govern-
ment has tolerated c a m p u s
demonstrations, but has refused to
allow them onto the streets. Earlier
on Tuesday an opposition trade
union marched to the International
Monetary Fund offices to d e m a n d
that the $43 billion bail-out
planned for Indonesia is delayed
until President Suharto c o m m i t s to
economic and political reforms.
President Suharto, aged 76 and
in bad health, has been in power
since 1966 and has been praised
for Indonesia's e c o n o m i c growth
until the crisis of last year.
Recently, however, he has attract-
ed criticism from both inside his
own country and abroad for failing
to deliver reforms promised to the
Indonesian people. The president
has said there will be no political
reforms before 2003, which has
further incited opposition groups,
including many retired military and
political figures.
Indonesia, with a population of
200 million, is the fourth largest
nation in the world, and an impor-
tant m e m b e r of the new G-15
group of emerging nations. During
the protests of the last week
President Suharto has been at the
G - 1 5 summit in Egypt: These lat-
est protests and the manner in
which they were handled can only
strengthen opposition calls for him
to stand d o w n and increase pres-
sure o n the international communi-
ty to take a tough stance with the
aging dictator.
