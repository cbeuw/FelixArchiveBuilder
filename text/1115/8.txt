MASSIVE ATTACK
Mezzanine * * ' / 2
15 May 1998
I
t has been about eight years
(has it been that long?) since
the Bristol trip hop pioneers
released their debut Blue Lines and
about half that since Protection.
U n d o u b t e d l y y o u already k n o w
Mezzanine went straight in to n u m -
ber one o n the album charts and
you must have heard the sublime
Teardrop graced by the vocals of
C o c t e a u Twins chanteuse Liz
Fraser. So should we believe the
hype? Massive Attack have always
been known as pioneers and quite
rightly so, Blue Lines fresh after all
these years. Does Mezzanine push
back musical frontiers (should we
expect it to?) or has the reputation
of their former two albums coaxed
people into giving it a listen as hap-
pened to myself.
This is initially the first mistake
you can make. If you are expecting
something similar to Protection or
Blue Lines you will be disappoint-
ed. What strikes you first is h o w
dark and shadowy Mezzanine is. It
is a difficult listen and its harrowing
oppressive-ness engulfs you espe-
cially towards the second half as
you deliberate your way through it.
There is a clear distinction
between the first and second half
of the album. Angel begins the
record, staggering epic like o n mor-
bid legs, awash with a throbbing
bass line and crunching guitars
turned up to full distortion. You are
given some light relief w h e n Rising
Son rolls along with its familiar res-
onance along with its nicked lyrics,
'Where have all the flowers gone,
long time passing'. Next y o u are
w h i s k e d through Teardrop a n d
Inertia Creeps o n t o Exchange
where the m o o d is brightened con-
siderably with a more chilled out
laid back-ness a n d a definite
absence of grinding guitars. Here
the first half ends and y o u enter the
heavier more trying second half.
Dissolved Cirl rises to a distorted
guitar climax that w o u l d sound
more at h o m e on a Megadeath
record, though this brief interlude
returns to the haunting vocals of Liz
Fraser with a familiar trip hop back-
ing. Man Next Door and Croup
Four are the more accessible of the
second half.
It was a surprise to discover the
meaning of mezzanine on a pro-
gram of W i p e o u t the other day but
the biggest surprise was the disap-
pointment of this album after hav-
ing been impressed by their previ-
ous efforts. El

THE DANDY WARHOLS
The Dandy Warhols Come Down * * • y2
A
fter their huge impact on the
student radio chart with 78
Stone Wobble, G o m e z have
released this their debut album,
which carries on from where their
single left off. Unusually the band
has t w o lead singers; one a
Commitments styled voice, perfect
for the blues with its gravelly tex-
ture and the other in contrast very
soft in sound and these are used in
t a n d e m to perfection. They g o
through the songs interchanging
the singers to suit the m o o d of the
songs, which all hint at different
types of guitaring, ranging from
Country to M e x i c a n .
Their lyrics give a lot of the
energy to album, about going d o w n
to the U n i o n , hanging out in
Piccadilly or just plain trying to get
arrested which s u m up life at the
moment for the average student.
You feel that their style is always
allowed to flow throughout and
that it was just written and record-
ed because they enjoy it.
Get Myself Arrested, possibly
the best song on the album, encap-
sulates the essence of the band.
The great harmonies a c h i e v e d ,
where you're not sure w h o is the
lead singer, as both voices are so
assured, combine with the bounce
of the rhythm and care- free-ness
of the song. I would have thought
that this will be their next single.
The band quite often slow the
songs d o w n , b e c o m i n g near
acoustic for a large portion of the
a l b u m , a l l o w i n g the singers to
s h o w y o u just how g o o d they are
and what power they're capable of.
Free To Run the best of these
tracks shows the blues side of the
band and you have to admit that
their diversity is admirable.
For a debut album, it's every-
thing that y o u want and shows
originality and innovation that is
now so rarely found. The easiest
way to generalise is that it is a stu-
dent album through and through,
and definitely doesn't take itself
too seriously. The singers are great,
the lyrics perfect and everything
else just falls into place around
them It's at a special low price for
a limited period, make use of it.CI

ave y o u heard of the Dandy
Warhols? If you have, then
it's probably because of
their current single, Not If You Were
The Last Junkie On Earth - a nice
blend of surf/pop/rock/psychedelia
that sounds a bit like W e e z e r .
(Well, it does to me anyway.) If you
haven't, then it's a shame because
this album is a lesson to all the
retro-meisters out there that like to
take the sixties and bring it, kicking
and screaming, into the nineties.
Mainly the work of frontman
and singer Courtney Taylor, this
bunch of Americans have been
around for a while, its just that no-
one over here really took any
notice. ...Come Down is their sec-
ond album to date. Their debut,
Dandys Rule OK came along in the
midst of the grunge scene and was
a m i s u n d e r s t o o d set of songs.
Who wanted to listen to retro when
Nirvana were expouning the latest
in heavy guitars and screaming
vocals? Their latest c o m e s at a
time when people are getting back
to the whole sixties thing. A few
years after the death of grunge, the
Dandys actually make sense.
If you have just heard the sin-
gles, then you've been mislead.
Sure, Every Day Could Be A Holiday
is a brilliantly psychedelic number,
but this is N O T , repeat N O T indica-
tive of the album. Imagine Weezer
being m e r g e d with a little
Spiritualised and you're closer to
the essence of the songs. M o s t of
the tracks have an almost drone-
like quality to them overlayed by
very dreamy harmonies.
Where it does fail is in the fact
that Courtney Taylor has indulged
himself a little too much. But what
else can y o u expect from an excit-
ing band? CI
