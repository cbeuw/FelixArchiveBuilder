A QUESTION OF MERCY
The Bush Theatre
15 May 1998
A
Question of Mercy is the
challenging n e w w o r k by
American playwright David
Rabe, in which he confronts head
on the sensitive issue of doctor
assisted suicide. W e , the audience,
are thrust abruptly into the life of
Anthony, a y o u n g man w h o s e exis-
tence has been transformed by
AIDS into one of endless illness and
suffering, and w h o has reached the
point where he wishes, quite sim-
ply in his eyes, to die. It is our priv-
ilege and pain, in equal measures,
to observe the tortuous process by
which A n t h o n y a n d his lover
Thomas attempt to fulfil this wish,
from the m o m e n t at which Dr.
Robert C h a p m a n , an ex-surgeon
w h o s e initial o p p o s i t i o n to
euthanasia c o u l d hardly be
stronger, is drawn into their plans.
The play is based on an essay
by Richard Selzer, which in drawn
draws predominantly on fact. The
m o m e n t u m of the piece is provid-
ed by the changing attitudes of the
characters to their task, as its
nature b e c o m e s increasingly clear.
Anthony and Thomas begin with a
romantic notion of suicide; all their
ideas are of soft lights and sweet
music, of "being together at the
e n d . " Dr. C h a p m a n , b e c o m i n g
gradually, unconsciously involved,
makes clear the need for meticu-
lous planning and grim determina-
tion. Anthony now begins to take
this to obsessive levels, while
C h a p m a n a n d T h o m a s b e c o m e
preoccupied with the basic illegali-
ty of what they are to attempt:
A n t h o n y will, at the a p p o i n t e d
time, take a lethal dose of barbitu-
rates, but if this m e t h o d fails,
C h a p m a n will duly administer a
morphine injection. This preoccu-
pation is the result more of a need
for something to fall back in, in a
time w h e n the framework of one's
personal convictions has collapsed,
than of the belief that the legal
solution to this problem is the
"right" one.
As the critical day approaches,
the realisation dawns on all except
Anthony himself that in all of this
painstaking and harrowing atten-
tion to detail, they have neglected
to consider themselves: how their
e m o t i o n s will influence their
actions and those of Anthony. A s
the play draws to its close, the
already labyrinthine plot twists still
further, reaching a c o n c l u s i o n
which in no way serves as a resolu-
tion of the conflicts raging through-
out.
The story is told through direct,
dialogue based scenes, inter-
spersed with soliloquies, mainly by
Chapman as a semi-narrator, and
the highly effective but, until one
grasps the unreality of the situa-
tion, terrifying nightmare sequence.
W e are spared no details, and for
me the concentration of repetitive
soul-searching and introspection is
a little too high. The production
rests on solid, powerful perfor-
mances, the cast even succeeding
in play d o w n the excessive use of
monologues, and the staging of the
piece is entirely suitable, minimal,
but without clear definitions of
space.
Both the writing and D o u g
Hughes' direction have a marked
effect on the emotional reactions
of the observer: I reach almost the
peak (or depth) of a particular
emotion, when something in the
tension o n stage shifts, and 1 a m
plunged into a different feeling
entirely. This means that the play
does not produce an overriding
sentimental response, rather evok-
ing in the audience a sharp sense of
the inner a n d outer conflicts
involved. From the audience it
d e m a n d s intense concentration
and sustained mental effort, and is
not a play to be simply "enjoyed."
The play claims no solutions to the
problem it portrays, and emphasis-
es not the question of "right or
w r o n g , " but of what, given human
nature and emotions, is truly possi-
ble, and, for a few hours afterward
at least, seems to place the edifice
of our society on somewhat shaky
foundations.

O
riginally released in 1933,
this musical revue has
been revived f r o m the
Irving Berlin family archives by the
director Ian Marshall Fisher. At the
outset it created controversy with a
song entitled " H e a t w a v e " which
contained the lyric "She started a
heatwave, by letting her seat
wave." The fact that it singled out
some of the most influential people
of the time, in a series of satirical
sketches, s e e m e d to pass the
American public by.
In two acts, the cast of eight
explore the big stories that hit the
press that year. The set is very min-
imal: a stage, eight chairs and a
pianist, and the only props are the
scripts which each actor reads from
throughout the performance. The
fact that this is, in a sense, a read
rehearsal does not detract from its
a t m o s p h e r e and impact. The
unusual aspect of this musical is
that the cast can act as well as sing,
and the simplicity helps you to con-
centrate o n expression and
character.
Don't worry if your 1930's gen-
eral knowledge is a bit patchy,
because everything is explained at
the beginning of the performance
by the director and a celebrity
guest, w h o in my case was Dick
Vosburgh.
The play covers a range of
diverse topics from the heatwave
that hit America at that time to the
International Debts conference,
and the structure of a newspaper is
retained as they w o r k through
home and International affairs to
the "funnys".
The great thing about the musi-
cal is that it observes the fanatical
efforts of its subjects with wry
insight. Waiters and chamber-
maids striving to become literary
greats after a visit from English
playwright Noel Coward; the erec-
tion of a enormous theatre on 6th
avenue as a birthday gift for M r
Rockefeller senior who's m o t t o
runs: " H a n g on to your money". M y
favourite sketch was inspired by
the expanding popularity of radio
stations. An opera show is brought
to the audience courtesy of the
new generation of millionaires from
which the c o m p a n y has had to
seek sponsorship. Unfortunately,
this happens to be the makers of a
fantastic new mustard sauce for
steak, you'll wonder how you ever
managed to live without it folks.
This musical was the first in a
series that are being shown at the
Barbican Centre entitled "The Lost
M u s i c a l s " . F o r t h c o m i n g p r o d u c -
tions f r o m the s a m e director
include " O n a Clear Day You Can
See Forever", " H o l l y w o o d
Pinafore" and "The Frogs".
