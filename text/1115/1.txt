College Attempts to
Ban Smokers
ANDREW OFORI
A campaign to exile smokers from
their own rooms failed to achieve
its objectives at a meeting of a
Rector's committee on
Wednesday.
A group of Wardens and Sub-
Wardens submitted a proposal to
review the college's policy o n
smoking in halls. Consisting of sev-
eral o p t i o n s , the most drastic
suggested a blanket ban o n
smoking in all residences. These
plans c o m e s o o n after recent
Health and Safety C o m m i t t e e
action banning smoking in the JCR
[Felix 1109].
Currently s m o k i n g is prohibited
in the halls' social areas but under
the w a r d e n s ' proposal smokers
would no longer be permitted to
seek refuge in their rooms. The
measures are a manifestation of
the college's recognition of the
dangers posed by smoking. The
meeting raised a number of issues,
with significant support for the ban
c o m i n g f r o m Dr M a r g a r e t
G o o d g a m e , college tutor. She high-
lighted the plight of asthma suffer-
ers w h o now make up one in ten of
the population. Cigarette smoke
often aggravates the condition and
she emphasised it was important
to take into account the comfort of
all residents. Other factors sup-
porting the ban, such as reduced
insurance fees, form part of an
ongoing investigation into the war-
dens' proposals. A current court
case involving an employee suing
her employers for damages after
her health was ruined by the
smoke-filled environment in which
she was forced to work, could also
be a consideration.
The committee chose to main-
tain the current policy, reflecting
the convincing arguments against
further s m o k i n g restrictions; resi-
dents are fee-paying adults, many
of w h o m are likely to object. There
is also the potentially nightmarish
task of suitably disciplining those
w h o breach any new regulations.
The committee decided to make
the newly refurbished Southwell
Hall non-smoking next year to add
to the already smoking-free Weeks
Hall as a trial run.
All plans are currently at a
d e v e l o p m e n t a l stage and Dr
Richard M u r p h y , Chair of the Sub-
Wardens committee, felt the mat-
ter should be resolved by "a college
wide consensus". He was deter-
mined to allay the fears of smokers,
explaining the proposals were "not
intended to be a Draconian mea-
sure" and any permanent regula-
tions w o u l d be the result of exten-
sive consultation.
Indonesia in Turmoil: Students Shot
ED SEXTON
This week Indonesia has wit-
nessed unrest and rioting that
has left six students dead and
several hundred injured.
The shootings occurred during
a protest o n Tuesday at Trisakti
University, a private college of
2 9 , 0 0 0 elite students in Jukarta.
A n estimated 5,000 students left
their campus around noon, aiming
to march to the M a y o r ' s office with
a petition d e m a n d i n g the resigna-
tion of President Suharto. The
demonstration was peaceful, but
was blocked by police on the air-
port road to Jakarta outside the
university campus. Reinforcements
quickly arrived, including British-
m a d e armoured Tactica cars with
water cannons, but the atmosphere
was initially g o o d humoured. After
a brief shower of rain the c r o w d
began to thin out, and the protest-
ers started to retreat in the late
afternoon. A c c o r d i n g to various
reports a scuffle then broke out
between a plain-clothed policeman
and some students, which led to
police charging the retreating

crowd with clubs. Tear gas, rubber
and live bullets were used, leaving
many students bleeding o n the
street. The police chased the stu-
dents back o n t o the c a m p u s ,
where the worst injuries occurred,
as snipers fired into the campus
from a nearby overpass. All major
entrances to the university were
blocked by police with troop lor-
ries. The six d e a d and over sixty
injured were taken to Sumber
Waras Hospital, but as night fell
many students were still unac-
counted for. Jakarta's police chief,
M a j o r General H a m a n i Nata,
claimed that the police had only
been issued with blank and rubber
rounds, and has launched an inves-
tigation.
The v i o l e n c e , however, has
continued. During the memorial
service at the university o n
Wednesday, a riot broke out which
resulted in thousands battling with
police and reportedly left one pro-
tester d e a d . Troops were lowered
by helicopter onto university build-
