COLUMNS 1 5 May 1998
Second only to moaning
about the temerity of
tutors w h o expect a little
graft, a c c o m m o d a t i o n is the major
gripe of students. While m y transi-
tion from poacher to gamekeeper
has reduced my sympathy for the
former, the dire state of cheap
housing annoys me as m u c h as the
next man. M y housing since leav-
ing Linstead has always been less
than palatial, with the o d d dodgy
landlord, but throughout this time,
I have maintained the utmost
respect for the quality of the
advice given by the Student
A c c o m m o d a t i o n Office. This, of
course, is because I have never
sought their advice. For the poor
sods that have had occasion to
use this facility, the situation
would appear less rosy. In recent
months, the rate of complaints
about the S A O has been steadily
increasing, far more than I can
remember in previous years. The
long-running saga about staff atti-
tude s e e m s to have s u b s i d e d ,
though it is not clear if this has
been resolved. The latest m o a n ,
c o n c e r n i n g the s t a n d a r d of
a c c o m m o d a t i o n , is of m u c h
greater i m p o r t a n c e . In this
respect, the 'service' is a shambles.
Having read the lists and seen
some of the properties, one is left
wondering why anyone bothers (or
indeed does anyone bother?). As
Jeremy remarked last week, no
attempt is m a d e to vet the land-
lords, which is very puzzling. The
possible reasons for this are
numerous. Does the College give a
toss? Are the S A O staff incapable
of s u c h assess-
ments? H a s it
even occurred to
anyone that this
may be a g o o d
idea? Yet again, it
displays the w o e -
ful shortage of
m a n a g e m e n t
savvy that so crip-
ples our non-aca-
d e m i c activities.
It is painfully
obvious, surely,
that College is in
a position to select and monitor
those that appear on its list, since
they are providing a supply of (rea-
sonably) reliable tenants with a
pretty m u c h guaranteed income
stream for fixed periods of the
year. S u p p l y a n d d e m a n d will
always ensure that landlords
would have their pick of candi-
dates. Secondly, it does not take

selling point for the College;
a c c o m m o d a t i o n has always been
this place's Achilles' heal. The cur-
rent situation
cannot be
allowed to c o n -

ly in the light of
the mergers.

It seems those cheeky Felix
photographers have been making
a nuisance of themselves again. It
appears that one of them has been
attempting to take a picture of the
Retail Catering Manager's door,
much to the chagrin of Catering
s u p r e m o , John Foster. All very
strange. W h y this door? Does this
office house Catering dark secrets?
Is this w h e r e Michelin-starred

menus? O r is it because Catering
spent £1 1 7.50 o n the little sign on

office's owner? Frankly, ladies and
gentlemen, it's a mystery.
Finally, this w e e k e n d sees the
year's most important football fix-
ture, o n w h i c h the hopes and
dreams of millions rest. I refer, of
course, to the annual Southside vs
ICU Bar game. Heretical to the
last, and in keeping with Felix's
independence, my money is on
Southside. Aside from the vastly
superior post-match refreshment,
the Prince's Gardens m o b have a

Union boys should not be underes-
timated o n the field of play. When

THOUGHT FOR THE DAY
Meditation and Cigarettes
Resident Evil two has been caus-
ing Our Kid some problems with
his revision. Somewhere out
there is a cigarette with
Play Station written on it...
P
eople w h o never go out are
weird, aren't they? Society
states implicitly that it is far
more healthy to be d o w n the pub,
slugging d o w n our tenth pint of
brain-cell killing, liver-rotting
Carling Premier, than sitting alone
for six hours in front of the televi-
sion playing Resident Evil 2 (which,
incidentally, is what I have been
doing today... ahem). Why? Well,
there can be no doubt that socialis-
ing is regarded by many as the rai-
son d'etre, the spice that life has to
offer; it is more enjoyable than
work, more fulfilling than solo pur-
suits, and more meaningful than
"forty-two".
But is this the case? It is cer-
tainly a widely upheld belief in the
West, where the cliche that is the
business world demands that we
behave in this manner. In the East,
though, where they seem to have
their psyches far more sorted,
there exists yoga, Buddhism, tran-
scendental m e d i t a t i o n . . . You've
tried it? O h , y o u haven't? Stop
moaning that your exams are not
going right, then.
Pursuits such as transcendental
meditation have countless benefits;
I'm no expert, but regular practi-
tioners of meditation enjoy lower
heart rates and blood pressure,
reduced stress, greater concentra-
tion and focus, and, after some
practice, experience of so-called
"higher states of consciousness"
(which, by the way, have a far more
salubrious and therapeutic effect
than listening to Josh Wink at two
hundred Watts).
Although this orgy of focused
thought might be regarded as an
extreme by some, practicing con-
centration throughout everyday life
can certainly be beneficial. O n e
exercise mentioned at the start of a
book 1 once read on Zen meditative
techniques suggests that a g o o d
workout for the mind involves say-
ing to oneself, whenever a task is
begun, that "This is the only thing
worth doing". This was included in
the book merely as a m e t h o d of
preparing the mind before the stu-
dent learns meditation properly,
but it will improve your concentra-
tion even if you d o not want to "go
the whole hog".
This leads me on to a little trick
of self-contemplation of my o w n
devising (please, autographs later).
Unfortunately it involves smoking
cigarettes (so if y o u don't smoke,
make sure y o u start tomorrow).
Buy a packet of your favourite
stinking cancer sticks (mild ones,
preferably), and write upon each
one s o m e event that has taken
place in your life, or a significant
person in your life, or whatever you
feel like considering. Over the five
minutes or so it takes to smoke
each one, think hard about what is
written on the fag, h o w it changed
your life, the g o o d points, the bad
points. M u l l it all over, and try to
draw conclusions from it that could
lead to s e l f - i m p r o v e m e n t . Who
knows, y o u might end up a better
person. O r y o u might end up dying
from lung cancer... perhaps this
wasn't such a g o o d idea after all.
Right, I'm off for fifteen minutes
meditation; s w i m m i n g though the
ether until I a m at total peace with
myself, my friends, and the world.
Or maybe I'm going to have one
more go at brutally butchering that
pesky, pixellated, playstation
zombie.
