VOICES OF DRUM l\T BASS (MILLENNIUM RECORDS)

A
s the title suggests, this
c o m p i l a t i o n focuses o n
vocal D & B tracks, a rare
breed indeed. This album makes no
bones about trying to be different
and steer away from the standard
D&B styles. The reason that this is
the first ever vocal drum and bass
compilation, is that, in my opinion,
it is very difficult to make vocal
drum and bass tracks that actually
work. The few g o o d exceptions
that I can think aren't featured
here, however.
I feel that the whole reason
that there are so few vocal drum
and bass tracks is in the roots and
background of the scene. Vocals
limit the tunes, a n d y o u can
say/communicate m u c h more with-
out lyrics.
A picture speaks a thousand
words, as they say, and it's the
s a m e with beats, breaks and
atmosphericals. 1 have always felt
that in electronic/dance music in
general it's not so m u c h what they
are saying but more about the
sound. The voice should be used as
an additional instrument rather
than as part of a story or a full on
song.
That said, I'm sure this will
appeal to a more mainstream audi-
ence, who, I'm told, prefer to have
a song with their music no matter
what style it's in. I suppose so they
have got something to sing along
to. There are plenty of g o o d tracks
on this compilation that are only let
d o w n by the lyrical content. The
only tracks on here that d o anything
for me are Aphrodite featuring Gail
M c l e a n , a wicked track, ]u Ju fea-
turing M a r s h a in an intelligent style,
Silverbeam's Weightless and
Nookie's We Can Make It Happen
This last track would sound better
still if the vocal was shorter.
The main difference between
these tracks and the rest of the
album is that the tunes use the
vocal in a different way: as a sound
to c o m p l e m e n t the rest of the
track, not so m u c h songs as
sounds.
This is definitely a different
approach to drum and bass, and
I'm sure it is just what some people
have been waiting for. It'll probably
have limited appeal to the under-
ground fraternity.

The Back Room
Hidden deep in a r o o m in the bowels of
Southside lies a r o o m few have heard of and
even fewer have ever seen. This mysterious cav-
ern vibrates to the sound of a multitude of dif-
ferent sounds, is hosted by a variety of hugely
talented Dj's, and yet still remains elusive to the
uninitiated. S o m e know it as Southside Disco.
Only those w h o truly have their ears to the
ground and can honestly say they know the
word on the street recognise it as 'The Back
Room'. W h y yes, even those kids on that Run
D M C video can't admit to knowing the score.
A new age is dawning. Whilst still recognis-
ing its roots, this great institution is under radi-
cal development. Paint s c h e m e s are appearing
like messages from the G o d s , and new blood is
being introduced to bring this stumbling youth
into adulthood. The Electric Cafe has a residen-
cy (catch them next on 29 M a y ) , and Thursdays
brings y o u a fortnightly rotation of your favourite
cheesy tunes from disco to indie. Fridays bring
you some of the hottest DJing talent in college,
playing s o m e of the largest tunes, c o m b i n e d
with silky s m o o t h mixing talents. A n d all this for
free- what more could y o u ask for?
If you haven't been before, here are ten rea-
sons why you should c o m e along:
1. It's totally free (no small print or hidden
extras)
2. Drink is cheap, unless y o u drink Staropramen,
in which case I'd r e c o m m e n d meths as a
tasty alternative. M y personal recommenda-
tion is Tennants Extra, purely for its alcohol to
money ratio. At 26p per percent of a pint,
you can't say fairer than that, guv'nor.
3. It's closer to home than most other places,
especially if you live nearby.
4. Where else can you go on a Thursday?
5. There are seats, so when the bar is full y o u
can sit d o w n .
6. Read number 2 again.
7. See rule 6.
Mixing competitions occur occa-
sionally, with anyone w e l c o m e to
test their vinyl prowess.
Because I get lonely in there o n my
10. 'And why not' as David St. Hubbins of Spinal
Tap would say.
A n d if all those plethora of reasons doesn't
persuade y o u that y o u must c o m e , then I'm
afraid you may be beyond help.
A n d finally, as a parting thought: you don't
have to have a mullet to be a mullethead.

Where It's At
This Thursday John, the master of cheese, is
spinning out his favourite slices of Emmental
(kids really will d o anything for the taste of
Dairy-Lea). Friday sees T o m and Lourie taking
over the decks for a trip to the heart of the
London sound. The Electric Cafe is taking over
the 'Chill O u t ' r o o m at the Union on the 22nd,
and will be stopping off at the Back R o o m on
the following Thursday.
