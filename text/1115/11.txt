MUTANT: DISCO COMPILED BY
COLIN DALE Harmless Records
FURTHER ADVENTURES IN
TECHNO SOUL - VARIOUS ARTISTS
P
eople w h o have been
involved in dance music for a
number of years seems to be
reminiscing back to the g o o d old
days. The days w h e n house and
techno were very m u c h the s a m e
thing. M a n y things have changed
since then. With the dance culture
explosion came many splinters and
sub-genres of musical styles.
Techno became repetitive, mini-
mal, sometimes completely funk-
less loops. House became hedonis-
tic and mindless, often exploited by
the mainstream.
Today a handful of DJs and
musicians are c o n f r o n t i n g the
problem and trying to turn the
clock back, not in terms of the
music that is being m a d e (that
would lead to stagnancy) but the
attitudes we should have as we lis-
ten. Colin Dale's latest a l b u m ,
Mutant : Disco is a tribute to the
many artists w h o are just making
music that they believe in. The
sleeve contains a fitting message
"Don't try to categorise, just lis-
ten."
Colin Dale is no stranger to
compilation albums. His t w o Outer
Limits were based on his successful
Kiss F M show and helped to estab-
lish his name outside of the L o n d o n
area. The Outer Limits albums were
devoted to the more off-the-wall
and progressive ambient sounds
that you can still hear on Colin's
show. They were the first contact
that many listeners had to s o m e of
the most innovative musicians in
electronica such as Dan Curtin and
Juan Atkins.
Colin describes Mutant : Disco
as "very m u c h a contrast. The
Outer Limits was more on a sort of
home-listening tip. This is very
m u c h a clubby sort of a l b u m .
House and techno tracks with a
disco influence."
The term disco influence that is
used by Colin isreferring to modern
club music that has been influenced
by disco music. "Disco music was
always about m a k i n g people
d a n c e . " Claims Colin, "It's not
music y o u sit and listen to in your
living r o o m . O n a loud club system,
disco music was made for dancing
to."
The tracks that have been
selected by Colin are from a variety
of different international artists.
The French craziness of Versatile
records is represented by l:Cube
(Metamorphik). Kevin Yost, a rising
star from the US w h o combines live
instruments into his rhythmic yet
jazzy deep house has one of his lat-
est tracks for i ! Records on this
album (Hypnotic Progression Pt 2).
Carl Craig's forays into house music
as Paperclip People are recognised
with the use of Paperclip Man. O n e
of Britain's stars of techno, Luke
Slater has Time Dancer included.
There are also some classics on
offer here. Flash from Fix (aka
Orlando Voorn) can be found here.
As well as the excellent 88 from H
+ M (Jeff Mills and Robert H o o d ) .
The mixing is kept to a mini-
m u m . This ensures that the tracks
are represented as pieces of music
in their o w n right, and may be lis-
tened to as such. Colin has the
courage to s h o w us that these
pieces have a definitive beginning,
middle and end. All in all this album
makes for essential listening. If you
like your music deliciously funky,
yet progressive and experimental,
then you shouldn't let this one pass
y o u by!

Ferox Records
L
ook out for a full explanation
and feature on Ferox records
in next week's electric cafe
column. Until then you just need to
know that Ferox Records is the
baby of one of the UK's most
inventive and passionate electronic
musicians. The style of the label
centres around music made o n
machines, but fused with human
qualities; soul, depth, passion and
love. Ferox has seen releases incor-
porating house, techno, funk, hip-
hop and jazz.
Here we have the s e c o n d
release in the Ferox compilation
a l b u m series. Called Further
Adventures in Techno Soul, it incor-
porates tracks from a wide range of
electronic artists signed to, or
friendly with the Ferox label.
The first track is a Russ Gabriel
remix of the classic At Les, original-
ly by Carl Craig. Russ has released
an EP under the pseudonym Fusion
on Carl's Planet E label which oper-
ates from Detroit, and this was part
of the exchange between them.
The track is very smooth and, I
believe a g o o d interpretation of the
original. It can't be easy to remix a
piece that is already engraved in
everyone's hearts. The emphasis
on Russ' reworking is to keep the
sounds clean and polished. The
jazzy theme is still there in the form
of some intricate rhythms.
N e w signing Bjom Torske con-
tributes the next track, called Don'f
Electric Shock Me. This is a really
beautiful piece of music; delicate
and subtle in its parts yet strongly
overpowering as a whole. This is
music to dream to!
Other artists featured are Stasis
(aka Steve Pickton), Aubrey, M a x
Brennan and Dan Curtin/Mike Filly.
All of the above have contributed
excellent pieces; daring and origi-
nal. Stasis takes the theme of elec-
tro and customizes it to fit within
his o w n abstract yet funky parame-
ters in Express. Aubrey has con-
tributed a typically rhythmic piece
of funk that isn't in a hurry to get
anywhere with Blue Lick\ M a x
Brennan has created a fine piece of
jazz-house fusion music with Sirius
at the Pier. Indeed his style and
love is to take styles of music and
genres of instruments and just
throw the whole thing into a big
melting pot. Dan Curtin/Mike Filly
are both already well-respected
producers and are a very welcome
addition to the Ferox collective with
this track The Longest Night. I a m
really in love with their music. The
whole thing starts off real funky and
seventies, then suddenly breaks
d o w n into a delicate string section
with bongo rhythms. The piece
changes throughout, and never lets
you get bored.
There is plenty more on offer
here. M a n y more tracks of distinc-
tion and quality. You're just going
to have to listen to them your self.
With this amount of space I a m
sure that I couldn't d o this album
justice. If y o u are interested in
music that is rooted in influences
as far-reaching as jazz, funk, soul
and hip-hop but is pointing the way
ahead then d o not ignore the
sounds of Ferox a n d especially
Further Adventures in Techno Soul.
