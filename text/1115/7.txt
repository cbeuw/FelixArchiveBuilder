15 May 1998 COLUMNS
So, the sun is finally shining and the birds are
tweeting which means it must be time to tempt
fate by writing up a few cool, refreshing n u m -
bers.
Taboule is a couscous-based salad original-
ly from the Mediterranean basin. Couscous is a
wheat based cereal product in the form of tiny
little balls. It is easily available and has even
been over-processed by culinary scientists from
the greatest megalo-petro-chemico-alimentary
multinationals into a boil-in-the-bag f o r m .
Luckily this sort of thing won't be necessary
here.
The second item in this week's double bill is
grilled aubergine. These should n o w be a rea-
sonable price (60p/lb) and make a beautiful
addition to any barbecue.
Taboule
*" 1 m u g couscous
1 lb tomatoes
*" 'A cucumber
2-3 spring onions.
10 leaves of fresh mint
some parsley
olive oil
1 lemon
First up, put the couscous in a sieve and
rinse it under running water. This removes any
loose flour and bits and pieces so the grain stay
well separated and starts the wetting the cous-
cous. Drain lightly and put the moistened cous-
cous in a large bowl or pan.
C h o p the tomatoes and cucumber into
small cubes and slice the spring onions. A d d
these to the couscous along with the juice of
the lemon, 4 or 5 tablespoons of olive oil, a
large pinch of salt and some ground pepper.
Finely chop the mint and parsley and stir
them thoroughly into the salad.
N o w for the really cunning bit. Place the
salad in a plastic bag and put into the fridge
overnight. The salt will make the tomatoes and
cucumber bleed their juices, which will be
absorbed by the grain until they have swelled
completely and turned gorgeously moist and
succulent.
Finally garnish with some more mint and a
few olives and enjoy.
Aubergine Crisps
Take one large aubergine and cut it into
slices about '/j c m thick. Lay these out on a
plate, sprinkle generously with salt on both
sides and leave to bleed for about half an hour.
Meanwhile crush and finely chop 2 cloves of
garlic and a g o o d handful of parsley. M i x this
and some pepper into 4-5 tablespoons of olive
oil.
Rinse the aubergine slices thoroughly under
running water and pat them dry on a tablecloth.
Finally, coat both sides with the flavoured oil
and place o n a very hot barbecue. They should
need about I minute o n both sides, long
enough to turn really brown but not charred.
If y o u want to make a whole meal out of it,
can I suggest barbecued sardines to accompa-
ny the last t w o items? Buy them fresh and
whole for anything less £l/lb. Sardines have a
very distinctive, lingering smell about them
which is why I'd say barbecuing is the only way
to d o them. As far as preparation goes all you
need to d o is wash and dry them. Cor, isn't life
hard! Grill them on a slightly cooler barbecue
than the aubergines until the skin starts to char
and peel off. Eat with fingers and lots of paper
serviettes/loo paper.
If you want to be extravagantly Mediterranean,
try finding and using the offcuts produced when
vines are pruned as fuel in your barbecue. It
definitely adds a great flavour but I wish you
luck! Antoine
