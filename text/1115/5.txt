IT'S A FAIR COP
Dear Jeremy,
Having written for Felix, a n d
having read y o u magazine's recent
articles, I feel compelled to write
an o p e n letter a n d what h a s
recently emerged as an important
issue.
It's as contraversial as t h e
legalisation o f cannabis. It's as
insidious as the a c c o m m o d a t i o n
office problems. It's as infuriating
as the pro-government sympathy
at the N U S . S o let's nail this sub-
ject right here, right now, and see
that it never rears its ugly head on
your pages ever again.
"It's" is a shorterned form of
"It is". "Its" is a possessive, like
"his" or "her" but for impersonal
objects (see last paragraph for
example of usage).
"Its'" is just plain wrong.
So will y o u and your subeditors
please stop defying the rules of
grammar as if they were nothing
more than N o Smoking signs in the
jCR? M a k i n g basic grammatical
errors like this makes Felix look
undignified a n d embarrassing (I
don't know if that's spelt correctly)
and it makes y o u and your staff
look like, well, a bunch of amateur
students. Er, look, hang on a sec-
ond, oh, never mind...

CONGRATULATIONS DEMONSTRATORS
to the organisers of the Summer
Ball, w h o have not only thought up
and initiated the event from scratch,
but have now managed to sell all
1 150 tickets weeks before t h e
event. Perhaps IC students aren't so
apathetic after all - you just need to
know how to rattle our cage.
COMMISERATIONS
to all those gullible enough to fall
for our April Fool story at the e n d of
last term (Felix Editor Arrested in
Drugs Scandal, if y o u still haven't
guessed). W e thought that w e had
made absurd enough for anyone to
realise it was a hoax before reach-
ing the second paragraph. But no.
Hundreds of copies of issue 1111
were handed t o security by well-
meaning if rather pathetic students
and staff. You are not alone - The
Times Higher a n d the W e s t
B r o m p t o n Police Station also,
incredibly, believed us.
O n c e in a while, something hap-
pens somewhere in the world that
makes y o u realise - for a f e w
m o m e n t s - just h o w petty a n d
insignificant your o w n concerns
are. Brought real a n d close by
newspapers a n d television, such
events always have a surreal,
d e t a c h e d aspect because it is
unimaginable that they would hap-
pen here - the brain just can't quite
m a k e t h e c o n n e c t i o n between
'your' world and theirs'.
The rioting and massacres cur-
rently taking place in Indonesia is
just such an event [see front page].
H o w pathetic it makes us look with
our m o a n i n g over tuition fees,
smoking bans and the N U S . Fellow
students in Indonesia m o a n e d ,
quite rightly, about their President,
and were shot d e a d . Yet in a few
week's time w e will forget, and it'll
be e c o n o m i c union, hot weather
and Tony Blair in the news once
more. O u t of sight, out of mind.
Have a nice w e e k e n d .
