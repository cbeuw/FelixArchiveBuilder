REVIEWS AND COMPETITIONS
M
artha Ateef... is simply
dying to be Four
Weddings &. A Funeral. A
lighthearted, easygoing romantic
comedy, filled with bizzare charac-
ters with ambiguous backgrounds
and lifestyles, its another entry into
the list of nice but intrinsicly dull
romantic comedies.
Monica Potter plays the epony-
mous Martha, who, flying into
London to escape her previous life,
meets pretentious (and utterly
unsympathetic) record exec Daniel,
who instantly falls in love with her.
She then bumps into Laurence in
the airport, and Frank meets her in
a park...
Quite frankly, it's all fairly for-
mulaic stuff, as she realises which
man is for her, then runs away, is
reunited, and they all end up hap-
pily ever after. Director Nick Hamm
pushes it all along fairly compe-
tently, but there's little originality or
flair shown, and you've probably
guessed the entire plot already.
The only highlight is the perfor-
mances from Monica Potter and
Liar is released this Friday, and
thanks to those lovely people at the
Odeon Kensington, you could be
seeing it for free.
Liar stars Tim Roth, as the
prime suspect in the murder of
prostitute Renee Zellweger.
Subjected to a lie detector test by
the cops, he not only beats the
machine, but plays mind games
with his captors. The seedy back-
grounds of each man is exposed,
and the finger of suspicion slowly
turns....
We have five pairs of tickets to
give away. For your chance win, tell
us:
Liar star Renee Zellweger was
last seen alongside Tom Cruise
in which hit romantic comedy?
Joseph Fiennes (Ralph's brother).
Fiennes is perfectly cast as the shy,
reserved and honest member of
the threesome, and Potter smiles
sweetly and goes gooey eyed in all
the right places.
Sadly, however, its main failing
is with the supporting cast. Where
Four Weddings excelled, Martha
falls down, with Rufus Sewell and
Tom Hollander (as Frank and
Daniel) unbelievable and, frankly,
annoying.
All in all, it's a wet afternoon
film. Martha isn't actually bad, it
simply doesn't distinguish itself in
any way shape or form, f l

STAR PROFILE: jUjIj
MORGAN
FREEMAN
B
izzarely, for someone who
celebrated his sixtieth birth-
day last year, Morgan
Freeman is one of the hottest
actors of the moment. Already
seen in three major big-screen
roles this year, he notches up a
fourth this week with the release of
Deep Impact.
Three times Oscar nominated,
Freeman is perhaps one of the
best mainstream Hollywood actors
yet to be awarded by the
Academy. His roles in Driving Miss
Daisy, Glory and most notably as
Elis Boyd "Red" Redding in the
Shawshank Redemption (one of
the best films of the decade) won
widespread critical acclaim.
This is particularly impressive
for someone who found stardom
so late in life. After leaving the Air
Force he scrabbled about looking
for work until finally breaking
through on stage. (Freeman has
earned three several awards for his
off-Broadway work).
Despite the critical acclaim
that some of his earlier work
received, and major roles in both
Kevin Costner's Robin Hood and
Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven, his
major breakthrough into the realm
of recognisable Hollywood stars
came with Seven. Starring along-
side Brad Pitt, as the perrenial
"cop with just a couple of days till
retirement", he moved into the
major leagues, and can now com-
mand a major salary.
Lending a touch of class to the
projects he signs for, his populari-
ty amongst both producers and
directors is clear from the sheer
scale of his recent output. And
whilst some of his films may have
been complete turkeys - Chain
Reaction and Hard Rain spring to
mind - Freeman still manages to
equit himself well. Indeed, in thir-
ty-odd years, you would be hard
pressed to find a bad performance
- and that's the sign of a true star.
