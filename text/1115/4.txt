Dear Felix,
I a m writing in reply to S i m o n
Baker's c o l u m n this week. H e
casually c o m m e n t s "The C & G
President hardly acquitted himself
well this year...". I w o u l d like to
point out that there have been two
presidents of C & G C U this year,
Viveke Bhalla a n d H a m i s h
C o m m o n . Althought the above
c o m m e n t probably does apply to
Viveke, Hamish has really started
to i m p r o v e the o p e r a t i o n of
C & G C U since he took over. This is
not just my sentiment, Andy H e e p s
c o m m e n t e d to the same effect at
the last ICU Council meeting.
Next year sees the centenery of
City fx Guilds College Union. It is
important that C & G C U is restored
to its former glory for next year, and
it is important that the members of
C & G C U (all the students in the
Management, C o m p u t i n g and engi-
neering departments!) help Hamish
and the Exec, to achieve this.
The Annual General M e e t i n g of
C & G C U will be held o n Tuesday
19th M a y at 6 p m in the Union
Dining Hall. Please attend the
A G M and see h o w well H a m i s h is
doing in turning round C & G C U .
There are positions still available
with C & G C U , so please give up
some of your time to help us. W e
would also appreciate suggestions
at the A G M for centenery events
for next year.
Regards
John Quantrell, HJT
City & Guilds Union
TURN YOUR
RADIATOR OFF, SI
Dear Felix,
It is a m z i n g that in this spate of
sunny weather and with the arrival
of the summer months, the heating
is still full o n in Southside halls.
Perhaps it is of s o m e consola-
tion to the conference office that
they are only as efficient as the
halls they run.
Yours,
Simon Cooper.
WHINE, WHINGE
Dear JT,
Are y o u really s o o o o o stuck for
news that y o u have to c o m m e n t on
that fact in a boring article on the
front page? What about page 2,
with the important news about
cancer, why wasn't that front page
- I'm sure most Felix readers know
at least one person who's died of it.
And if there is no cure found with-
in the next 6 0 years or so, it's
almost certain that we're all gonna
die of it (that or maybe heart dis-
ease).
I'm no journalist, but I d o know
that one has to go out to get news,
it doesn't just fall in your lap while
you're lounging around, and one
more important m o a n perhaps jo
public could read this letter and
maybe s/he c o u l d L E A R N T O
WRITE PROPERLY and s o m e punc-
tuation wouldnt go amiss either in
fact this is their biggest weakness
and breaking up paragraphs into
sentances with one of these funny
little squiggles eg ,.'; would be nice
too and perhaps getting an editor
to read through the work after-
wards to check that it actually
makes sense a rarity for jo i know
Yours sincerely,
D Clarke, Phys I
Apologies to Dan and everyone
else for the shoddy news section
last week - it really wasn't good
enough.
However, a few points in your
letter are unfair. We put a lot of
effort into searching for stories,
and I held the front page far
longer than usual to include any
last minute news. Sadly none
vaporised (although if you or any-
one else knows of any, please
give us a call). As for lounging
around, I spend 29 and a half
hours at work on Tuesday and
Wednesday alone, including five
at St Mary's trying to find a good
story.
As for your gripes over Jo
Public's writing style, I'm willing
to wager that there's more errors
in your short letter than in last
week's entire clubs section. Ed.
Deadline for letters is 6pm Tuesday. Letters may be edited for
length, but will not be altered or corrected in any other way.
Letters may be signed or anonymous, but please show your swipe
card when submitting them.
ANDY HEEPS HITS
THE BARS
An Open Letter from the
President of the Union to the
Council of the Union
At its meeting on Tuesday this
week, the ICU Council mandated
me to report on the current posi-
tion regarding the medical school
bars. I copy it to Felix for the bene-
fit of the wider membership.
A question was asked at the
meeting about the Union's decision
not to take direct control of the
bars on August I 1998. Such a
decision has not been made; a
m e e t i n g of the U n i o n Trading
Committee deferred the decision
until such time as the sabbatical
team could investigate whether a
more viable option (and by more
viable, I mean more beneficial to
the membership w h o will use those
bars) could be found. Together
with Katie Armstrong, Nick Carter
and the Deputy Secretary of the
School of M e d i c i n e , I a m investi-
gating whether an external c o m p a -
ny could achieve the aims of flexi-
bility and low prices d e m a n d e d by
such outlets. O n e c o m p a n y has
shown an interest in tendering such
a bid.
However, the decision has not
yet been taken by the Union, and
w e still have first refusal o n any
proposals. Whatever the outcome,
the Trading Committee shall report
to Council at the next convenient
opportunity.
Yours faithfully
Andrew Heeps, ICU President

Dear Felix,
Has a n y b o d y n o t i c e d the
uncanny similarity b e t w e e n the
spiritual and visionary leader of
Imperial College Union, and Andy
Heeps? I think we should be told.
Yours, Everybody.
