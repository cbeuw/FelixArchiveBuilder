ell, hello and welcome.
This week, let's start off
with The Freestylers, the
breakbeat phenomenon that just
keeps c o m i n g on. The new single
Ruffneck is due for release on the
22nd June and it's gonna be anoth-
er smash, so look out for a full
review nearer the time. After the
huge success of their last release
and their blistering live sets, they
have been receiving w o r l d w i d e
acclaim. O n a recent trip to the
USA, they teamed up with Arthur
Baker to record a track for their
forth c o m i n g album featuring the
vocal talents of Soul Sonic Force.
They have also had meetings
with rapper C h u c k D (Public
Enemy), and it seems as if a collab-
oration is underway for the album.
With the boys not only meeting, but
also working with one of their idols,
I can't wait to hear the end prod-
uct. Don't forget, the boys are play-
ing live all over the place: DJ sets in
the not too distant future are:
Phoenix a n d Reading, Gallery -
Turnmills, 2 2 n d M a y , Heavenly
Social - Tummills, 30th M a y .
Tuff and |am are set to release
their first full production since the
top 40 smash TJR- Just Gets Better,
Sweet Love featuring Bennet &
M a c a r d o . I'm told it occupies the
same tuff groove territory and I
can't wait to hear it. It should be
available on p r o m o in the c o m i n g
weeks and full release in the not
too distant future.
Tuffjam's m i x e d c o m p i l a t i o n
album, Underground Frequencies
vol.2, will also be released some
time this month, featuring not only
up-front flavours but some classics
from the past such as Love Shy and
M-Dubs vol.1.
Whilst on the garage tip, it's been
g o o d to see that the scene's con-
tinually evolving not stagnating, as
so many critics suggested it might.
I've heard c o m m e n t s such as
"every tunes got a w a h w a h sub
bass and people are bored with it,
all those people that jumped on the
band wagon when all the speed
stuff was going on have jumped off
again." The s o u n d has totally
changed again over the last few
months, moving away from the
wah wah sub bass and more into
clever key and beat arrangements.
I've been calling it The Smooth
Groove Sound, to give it a label.
Critics still d o n ' t s e e m to
understand that the people making
the music get bored quicker than
the people listening because they
want to make something different
and original. They also have a deep
and genuine love for the music,
something the mainstream music
people are not used to. This is why
music will keep growing and chang-
ing.
Last u p : Scott Garcia's club
night. It's A London Thing, current-
ly at N o 4 Kingston, is on the move
in a few weeks. It's still going to be
on every week in London Town, I'll
let y o u know as soon as the new
venue has been d e c i d e d upon. O n
top of this, they are going to be
doing a UK and European tour, so
look out for them p o p p i n g up all
over the place.

DRUM * BASS / DOWNBEAT GABAGE
Undercover Agent: Cosmic / Full
Metal /acker (|uice) 18th May.
This is another fresh biscuit from
the Juice boys. From spacey effects
and atmosphericals and a minimal
drum pattern, this builds into a
right stormer with futuristic bass
tones and tight c h o p p e d up drums.
This is getting d r o p p e d by all the
big boys such as Hype, Zinc and
Bryan Gee. The flip-side is just as
good with fast skipping beats and
droning sub-bass that just keeps on
building, every break getting better
and better. The more I hear this
track, the more I like it.
Step 2: Fluid / Hardnoise Out Now
Another true double A sided piece
of vinyl, with both sides doing the
business. Fluid has a dark intro,
quickly dispensed with, as a raw
tearing drum pattern takes over.
Amen stabs c o m e in and out of the
mix, keeping it bubbling along. It is
as hard as you like. With a subtle
bassline, the clever beat arrang-
ments and synthesised sounds d o
all the damage. The flip-side is just
what it says: rugged beats that roll
along, a strong bassline and clever
atmosphereicals and effects.
Magistrate: Phohibited
(East side) Out Now
W o r d s like smooth and phat c o m e
to m i n d w h e n listening to this
track, with its rumbling sub-bass,
tight beats and killer flexed bass
line. . The flipside is darker and in a
2 step stylee. I love the eerie
effects alongside the beats. Then in
d r o p s the wobbly bassline and
stepping drums.
M u k i : Fullscope (Manta) 18th
May
This is downbeat at it's very best:
chilled, trippy and beautiful all at
the same time. You get four tracks
o n here: all can be loosely
described as above. All feature
clever programming aside dreamy
vocals and inspired atomsphere-
icals. Sheer class. Get away from it
all without leaving the comfort of
your stereo. M u k i brings in a breath
of fresh air.

Nu-Birth: Anytime (XL) 25th May
Anytime was a big hit w h e n
released last year, now it's back
with a shitload of new mixes. So
many in fact that there should be
something for all tastes. Tuff Jam
d o an inspired reworking of this
track, bringing it bang up to date
with more of the vocal than the
original, but in a way that works so
well With the upbeat broken by
two-step beats and stabs of sax
and keys, it is wicked. The D e m 2
mix is a slow two-step style and
they even give it a dark edge. The
Crazy Bank mix hardens it up by
a d d i n g timestretches and other
things. I suppose some would call
this the speed mix. The original is
also on here in case you missed it
first time around.
Lovestation: Teardrops (Fresh
Records) 25 May
Another double 12" pack, with
eight mixes to choose from includ-
ing R'n'B, Classic House and more
dubby workings. These are all
mixes of the chart hit of the 80s
from W o m a c k and W o m a c k . I'm
positive that this will go d o w n well
at the more commercial clubs. That
said, there are a couple of mixes
that I have been playing. The
Banana Republic dub is quite
superb: it almost gets away with
using the Footsteps sample with-
out you noticing whete it's taken
from and the a d d e d deep inside
vocal, easy going beats and nice
key patterns means it's been going
d o w n well in the clubs. If you want
to go a little harder. Wildcat also d o
a quality mix with heavy jungle
overtones. Have you got a license
to play this sort of dub plate is
taken from C h r o m e 'n' Time jungle
track alongside timestretched title
vocals. It just gets better as it goes
on.
Y Tribe: Baby (You Bring Me Up)
(Deconstruction) 25th May.
O n e for the vocal garage lover. 1
like the beats and arrangements of
the original mix but the vocal does
nothing for me. The dub mix just
isn't hard enough either but should
work well in the more commercial
clubs. I'm not so sure about the
underground appeal though.
