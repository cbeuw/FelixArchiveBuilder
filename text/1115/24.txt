Motor Club in Shock Karting Greatness
The City & Guilds College M o t o r
Club is now the proud owner of a
seemingly d r u g - i n d u c e d trophy
following its performance in the
four-round inter-university karting
championship.
Our challenge to win the series
began dubiously in the first round
at Silverstone. W e finished well
down the order with many excuses:
'The track was appalling' (Matt
Dowie), 'They drove worse than the
Spanish' (Simon C o p e ) a n d
'Grumble grumble grumble' (Phil
Wise, Peter Holroyd). O n e univer-
sal complaint was the 'heats' type
of racing; each of the team's four
drivers c o m p e t e d in several heats
and their finishing positions were
then combined in some complicat-
ed manner to produce team points.
Unfortunately, this format was
used again at Daytona Raceway in
Shepherds Bush. Here, our drivers
d i d better a n d m a n a g e d third
place.
W e were now looking forward
to two rounds of racing at Milton
Keynes. W e may be m a d , but not
as m a d as you might think. Here's
why: The races were proper 1 Vz
hour races and the track (Daytona
International) is a huge one with
plenty of dangerous flat-out cor-
ners. W e thought we could d o
some winning here!
The day c a m e &. started badly.
W e waited for our star driver, Pete.
W e waited some more. A n d some
more. Then w e set off without him.
Everyone was glum except me (it
meant 1 would get to drive instead
of being sub and journalist). W e
then decided to go back d o w n
Exhibition Road, just in case, and
there he was, running from the tube
station (damn!).
At the track, the benefits of
having Pete were beginning to
show: 4th in qualifying for the first
race.
O n c e they got underway, our
pace was confirmed and we drove
a m o n g the leaders. W e then made
a perfect refuelling stop and found
ourselves ahead. At our last driver
change, we looked all set to win
until the driver (who shall remain
nameless....) decided to leave the
pits at a red light. O o o p s . W e
were hauled in for a penalty stop &.
ended up finishing way d o w n the
order. This wrecked our chances
for the championship. Bollocks.
During qualifying for the next
race, we brought Peter in to the
pits, but decided we shouldn't have
a n d so sent h i m out again.
Unfortunately not only did he not
stop, but he d i d n ' t even s l o w
d o w n . Following a short discussion
with the race director, we managed
to d o a 'double or quits' deal to
avoid the penalty for this (starting
from the back of the grid). If we
messed up in the race, we would
be in serious trouble.
W e w o n the race and began to
work out our championship posi-
tion. W e had the same number of
points as Cardiff, but because we
had done the most laps on the day,
we w o n . Nail-biting stuff. H a n g
on, we w o n ! W e w o n ! W E W O N ! !
Yippee! O nameless driver, you are
forgiven because W E W O N ! (and
because you bought us all a meal
back in Ealing!)

EITHER...
It was up at the crack of d a w n for
the five illustrious paddlers selected
from the Canoe Club to represent
Imperial at the BUSA Canoe Polo
C h a m p i o n s h i p s , held o n a lake
s o m e w h e r e near Stratford, last
weekend.
Hicksy, Colin, Sam, 'Useless'
Rob and even Garth all surprisingly
made the 6 . 4 5 a m meet time o n
Saturday morning, to be met by the
problem of one boxed in mini-bus.
But, with luck, and possibly a little
applied break-in and entry, the
team had made it to the venue by
the 9 a m start time.
First up for the slaughter were
Cambridge B, w h o due to generally
pathetic shooting, we only man-
aged to defeat by 2 goals to 1.
Both messy, testosterone induced
goals came from Garth.
Bristol, last year's runners up,
looked a more worthy opposition,
especially their shiny boats, which
mades us feel embarrassed in our
technicolour plastic outfits. The
first half progressed dreadfully,
even when given the ball at each
restart, we could find nothing better
to do with it than pass it to the
Bristol boys to allow them to score
again. The second half saw a
change (introduction?) of tactics,
with Hicksy chasing the ball and try-
ing to connect with as many Bristol
players as possible. Pressure
c a u s e d mistakes, a n d w e even
managed to connect the o d d pass.
A lovely little hand-off from Colin
gave Sam a shot from near the half
way line that hit the mark. Within
another minute he'd done it again -
a comeback in the making?. The
final result, 8-2 to Bristol was upset-
ting, but we did dunk them more
than any other team in the
tournament!!
W e stayed on the water to await
Oxford. Something of a grudge
match since a tournament in Bristol
last year, they proved themselves a
more coherent team, going 2 goals
up rapidly. A revival started, most-
ly due to a long pass to Hicksy
under the goal, and then another
more fluid play along the wing,
again finding Hicksy, drawing us
level. Blind referees and fun tackles
soon ended in Hicksy rolling up with
a broken paddle, much to the U L U
refs enjoyment, until he realised
that it wasone of their paddles we'd
borrowed!! Still, you expect a lot of
shafting at these events! Play
resumed, but the pause allowed
them to regroup, and c o m e back
with two more goals. At least they
bow to our superior drinking skills.
Free B B Q and reasonbly priced
beer a l o n g with paddlers from
around 35 Uni's meant a loud night
with traditional boat races that did-
n't involve kayaks and a few human
pyramids that Garth provided an
appropiately sized centre stone for.
In keeping with the Imperial spirit,
however, most of the team ail
retired to the tents before the bar
even closed!!!
Sunday saw another defeat to
Teeside, 2-0. This was the w r o n g
result but no-one was in the m o o d
to score, so we gave the match
away, mostly through poor passing
and non-existent team-play. But
possibly also d o w n to Useless Rob
giving the ball to a Teeside sadboy
two metres from our goal line.
Dignity was salvaged in the final
match against Glamorgan. With
everyone managing a goal except
Useless Rob, w h o even felt safe
enough to leave his goal and play
with the team! Final Result 4-0 to
Imperial.
The weekend rounded off with
the bus breaking d o w n just outside
the union, but Useless Rob actually
proved quite helpful by mending it
after the RAC guy c o n d e m n e d us to
Hunt's Trucks.
Serious canoe polo happens at
U L U . Usually, they're a right bunch
of mincing poofs, but they man-
aged to stay in the bar longer than
most of us, and beat their arch-
rivals Bristol. With their mens team
narrowly losing to Loughborough in
the final, and their w o m e n taking
the ladies bronze, they've done well
this time.

any of it's facets? Drop us a mail o n

...OR
Canoeists with balls...
Canoeists with fannies more like .
Up at the crack of dawn for the five
shirt lifting paddlers...
...who only managed to beat
Glamorgan (where canoe polo can
only be played after the ice has
melted) and Cambridge B team (for
novices and complete spooners)
...and w h o were drunk under
the table by a bunch of similar
mincing poofs from U L U !
What a weekend of lashings of
ginger beer, fun and frolicks that
must have been!
See you all in the pool tonight...
so don't worry you can all get your
o w n back then!
