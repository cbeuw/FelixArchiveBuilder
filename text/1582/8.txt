Should we ban alcohol in the UK?
Anita Chandran looks at whether the glass is half full or half empty
Government bans are tricky because
it is hard to know and understand
why the government sacrifices the
ability of individuals to choose what
vices they live with.
It is plain that the state bans
substances which cause substantial
harm to individuals within it. In the
case of alcohol, not only is the drinker
harmed, but substantial harms to all
others involved occur. Street violence,
domestic abuse and child abuse are
common, unmanageable by-products
of the drug.
Alcohol and its mind altering
effects have comparable harms
to more sinister substances that
the government bans already.
The ethereal state, our governing
body, has obvious obligations to its
voter base, and to the principles of
democracy. Yes, state obligations,
what a nice thought.
That said, arguably the most
important role of the state is to
protect its citizens. Legislation exists
to ban drugs which have comparable
effects to alcohol. Why? Because the
government recognises the harms
that come with their legalisation.
This is particularly important when
considering how deeply ingrained
alcohol is within British culture.
Public awareness campaigns are
failing. Higher taxation is simply
forcing the market to retarget its
efforts. Alcohol is as it always has
been: a romanticised pleasure.
Clearly, something more drastic must
be done.
The widespread cultural
importance of alcohol makes this
ban a controversial one. However,
it is also one that legitimises the
harms of alcohol. One of the primary
dangers of alcohol is that people
do not view it as a particularly
harmful substance. This is even more
problematic because people tend to
drink alcohol passively. What do we
mean ‘passively’? Well, having half
a bottle of wine with dinner, or a
couple of cans of lager watching the
telly every night and not realising
the risks. It’s having a ‘little tipple’
that sometimes goes too far. People
become dependent on their drinks
without even realising it.
Because people are unaware of
the long term effects of alcohol, the
number of people suffering from
liver disease has risen sharply. The
NHS reported recently that, in the
last decade, hospitalisation due to
liver illness has risen by 25%. The
government is taking a non-serious
stance to alcohol. When damning
health reports are arising, this stance
implies that alcohol is an acceptable
drug.
By banning the sale and
distribution of alcohol, the state says
to its constituents that alcohol is a
serious risk to their health. But what
does this actually mean? People feel,
en masse, that breaking the law is
something negative. For the most
part, breaking the law makes people
feel unsafe. When this is the case,
people are far less likely to take steps
to obtain alcohol illegally.
Furthermore, when alcohol is so
taboo, it hits hardest the youngest
generations of upcoming drinkers.
When the drug is difficult to acquire,
and illegal to obtain, people become
less likely to obtain it.
Considering that the group in
society with the largest likelihood
of alcoholism, the largest chance of
suffering chronic liver disease, is
the 16-25 age category, it seems like
targeting their perception of alcohol
is crucial.
While it’s probably correct to say
that the state exists to protect its
constituents, it is foolish to ignore
the frankly appalling consequences
of a total ban on alcohol. There are
obvious reasons why there is such a
big difference between the treatment
of alcohol and other banned
substances.
Alcohol is a drug that is easily
brewed. It is easy to procure alcohol,
but difficult to procure alcohol of
good quality. Finally, when alcohol
was banned in the Manhattan
prohibition, ten thousand people fell
victim to severe alcohol poisoning by
drinking impure alcohol.
When alcohol is banned, people
look to cheaper, more secretive ways
of brewing and distributing alcohol
for the consumer market. This has a
number of effects.
The first is that the alcohol
produced tends to be of far lower
grade, produced from cheaper and
more innocuous materials such as
types of wood. This alcohol tends
to be the sort that causes the sort of
bodily harm mentioned previously.
You’re scientists and hence can
probably discern that drinking
methanol produced from wood or
distilled from solvents is not the best
idea for your liver.
Secondly, even when it isn’t of a
low grade, it’s not possible to mass
produce and distribute good quality
liquor by yourself. The nature of
production and distribution has
to become secretive. To secretly
distribute alcohol in quantity
requires a very concerted and
organised effort. This tends to
manifest itself in organised crime
structures. Needless to say, groups of
organised criminal hierarchies are
harmful both to the people involved
in them, and to the neighbourhoods
in which they reside.
Thirdly, it pushes the culture of
drinking itself underground. To say
‘banning alcohol means that people
won’t drink it’ is a simplistic view of
both people, and the role of alcohol
within our society. Many people use
alcohol as a tool for social interaction
and it features prominently in their
lives. Moreover, people are already
aware that alcohol is bad for them.
Really though, people appreciate
autonomy over their own bodies: they
want to be responsible for their own
lives.
When people feel infantilised, they
resent the state for babying them. In
this case, people are likely to continue
wanting to drink. While this means
that some people get lower grade
alcohol from shadier sources, a ban
would have a particularly profound
effect on the people that are most
desperately in need of state help and
care: those severely dependent on
alcohol.
It is obvious that there is still a
market for alcohol under the ban. If
people continue to drink, the harms
associated with alcoholism still exist.
There is one crucial effect here, and
that is that people are unwilling to
seek help for alcohol addiction; they
are unwilling to engage with hospitals
and support staff when they suffer
from alcohol related problems. This
is obviously bad. Why? Because all of
the alcohol related problems which
exist within our society already are
made worse when people cannot
seek out help. When people do not
feel that the state can provide the
sanctuary that they need, they do
not feel protected. Rather, they feel
victimised and helpless: a truly awful
consequence.
"Alcohol is
as it always
has been: a
romanticised
pleasure."
"When
people feel
infantilised,
they resent
the state
for babying
them."
