ICXC TREASURER
On Friday 12th September 21
members of Imperials Cross Country
and Athletics Club (ICXC) set off for
a weekend of running, relaxing, and
occasional raucousness in the stunning
backdrop of the Mendip Hills and
Glastonbury Tor. Arriving late on
the Friday evening there was sadly no
running done on the first day due to a
lack of sunlight. This didn’t dampen
spirits however; an early advance party
led by last year’s treasurer Harveen
Hayer had mustered up a small feast
to prepare the late arriving minibus of
athletes for the packed weekend ahead.
The next morning there were early
pre-breakfast runs from some, whilst
others including webmaster Duncan
Ingram and myself chose to wait until
after food before heading to nearby
Yeovil for a track session to sharpen up
our speed for upcoming races, along
with pacing support provided by Sport
Imperial’s Athlete of the Year Chris
Bannon. Those not running around in
circles then headed off to indulge in
some river swimming after a second
run of the day in the midday sun. All
were soon back relaxing at the hostel,
with some nursing bruises from a
rather precarious rope swing! In the
early evening we headed out again, this
time to Glastonbury Tor itself for hill
reps weaving between tourists! Both
those running and also those cheering
from the top with the first beers of the
night received many strange looks.
Special mentions should go to James
Ellis for claiming the fastest time up
the tor (beating many local runner’s
times as well), to next year’s captain
Matt Douthwaite for completing a
partial rep whilst giving a piggyback,
and to Matthias Knop; who completed
a full rep with a crate of beers, holding
his own with all but the fastest few!
Once hill reps were done, nearly all
had done enough running; with the
daily mileage for some reaching nearly
40km! Returning to the hostel again
there was a circuits and stretching
session led by Alwyn Elliot in the
fading evening light for most, whilst
a few took one last easy jog to loosen
off tired legs. Both these sessions
finished abruptly thanks to some
maverick pace setting in the closing
stages on the run and the suggestion
of tour tradition “Drinking Jenga” for
those doing circuits. The evening that
followed may only serve to reinforce
the opinion that XC&A celebrate as
much as they train. I would go into
more detail, but what goes on Tor stays
on Tor.
The Sunday morning consisted of
a late start, with a post breakfast long
run on the agenda for all but a few to
get rid of the toxins from the night
before. This was followed by a trip
to a local pub for a fantastic Sunday
roast before the group headed back to
"I would go
into more
detail, but
what goes
on Tor
stays on
Tor"
"Those not
running
around in
circles then
headed off "
Imperial Cross Country go on ‘Tor’
London (with a brief sight-seeing stop
at Stonehenge) to catch up on sleep
and to relive the memories in hushed
voices so as not to be overheard.
Special thanks should be given to
all those involved; notably Harveen,
Alwyn, and Matt without whom the
tour wouldn’t have gone ahead, and to
all of those who mucked in throughout
the weekend to keep all the activities
running smoothly.
For any freshers wanting to get
involved with one of the most
welcoming clubs in Imperial come
and find Cross Country & Athletics on
Queen’s Lawn at the Freshers Fair. We
cater for all abilities from the social
athlete, to the casual jogger, to those
wanting to compete at university and
national level!

In a new weekly column, Kunal Wagle
rounds up all the major sports stories
around the world during the week. In
a fresher’s issue special, this time we
show you what you may have missed
whilst you were on the beach this
summer.
In the FIFA World Cup, Germany
came out winners after beating Ar-
gentina 1-0 after extra time. In a
hugely embarrassing week, Brazil
lost their semi-final 7-1 before being
thumped by the Netherlands 3-0 in
the third place playoff.
In a seesaw title race Lewis Hamil-
ton has the advantage (at the time of
writing) over his Mercedes teammate
Nico Rosberg with just five races to go
in the Formula One season.
In cricket, Alistair Cook answered
his test match critics as England beat
India 3-1, only to be dispatched by the
same score line in the one-day series.
Also, Yorkshire won their first Coun-
ty Championship in thirteen years, al-
though it wasn’t without controversy
– captain Andrew Gale had the dubi-
ous privilege of being charged with
making racist comments in the roses
match – the first English person to be
accused of such an offence. Mumbai
Indians’ title defence in the Champi-
ons League crashed and burned in the
qualification round.
Bath and Saracens have made
storming starts to the Aviva Premier-
ship in rugby union. Bath took apart
Leicester 45-0 to keep their winning
record, whilst Saracens crushed Har-
lequins at The Stoop 39-0 to stay in
touch at the top. New Zealand has
the lead in the Rugby Championship,
with Australia and South Africa tied
in second.
After a tough summer, Andy Mur-
ray has lost his place in the top ten in
world tennis. He lost in the Wimble-
don and US Open quarterfinals, and
now faces a stiff challenge to qualify
for the World Tour Finals in Novem-
ber. Murray will be aiming to over-
take Marin Cilic, who was the surprise
winner of the US Open in September.
He beat Roger Federer in the semi-fi-
nal, before overcoming Kei Nishikori
to take his first Grand Slam title.
Rory McIlroy underlined his status
as the one to watch in golf, as he took
victory in the Open, and followed it
up with the US PGA Championship.
He is now the world number one and
will be confident of helping Europe to
victory in the Ryder Cup, which will
have just happened as we go to print.
England had a hugely successful
Commonwealth Games in Glasgow,
as they topped the medal table, de-
spite losing star man Mo Farah to
illness.
The early season league premier
league table suggests that Chelsea
have made the most of the transfer
window as their new signing Diego
Costa has continued his prolific form.
Manchester United spent north of
£150 million during the summer, but
results are yet to show for it.
