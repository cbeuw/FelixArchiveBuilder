THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 41
FELIX
Sports Editor: Kunal Wagle
ICUAFC’s summer tour got off to a
shaky start. Since all bad experiences
start in the u`Union we thought this
was the best option to begin what
would become the worst week of our
lives so far.
The flight was tedious, but soon
we arrived in Malaga and tour could
start in earnest. After checking into
our home for the next 4 days, we set
off in search of the beach. Despite it
only being a short walk, the group
struggled but eventually everyone
made it and promptly got in a little
keepy-uppy practice.
The first night was certainly eye-
opening: heading out after dinner we
found the city empty. Apparrently
no-one had received the memo saying
that Spaniards don’t even think about
going out until midnight. We had
precisely zero chance of scoring with
the locals but if there’s one thing
we don’t lack its enthusiasm so we
carried on regardless.
Themorning-after-the-night-before
required some R & R so we headed to
the beach to exhibit the best qualities
of Brits travelling abroad: alcohol
poisoning and sunburns.
On Tuesday we had our first match
against Sevilla FC in front of a
bumper crowd of seven. This broke
ICUAFC’s previous record crowd by
seven. The game was a cagey affair
with neither team managing to break
the deadlock early on. Ivan Rakitic,
in what would be his last game for
Savilla before Barcelona came calling,
was running the game early doors but
it soon became clear he had met his
match.
Not usually known as a midfield
general Rakitic’s tireless running and
impressive distribution put seasoned
campaigners, such as Uptight
and Shatner, to shame. Drawing
comparisons to a young Clarence
Seedorf he was at hand in the first
goal, playing a delightful through ball
to an onrushing Frankel who poked
the ball through the goalkeeper’s
legs. Frankel was determined to
win the golden boot outright this
time, having had to share it with an
ICUAFC legend the previous year.
The two teams went in to half-time
with ICUAFC leading by the solitary
goal. After a quick siesta the two
teams returned and it soon became
clear that despite winning the Europa
League just a few weeks previously,
this was the match that Sevilla
really wanted to win. They came out
with fire in their bellies and soon
converted this energy in to goals with
a quick double salvo from Rakitic
putting the hosts ahead. It would need
a spirited comeback from ICUAFC to
come away with the three points and
unfortunately they were only almost
up to the challenge.
A blinding save by ICUAFC led to
a speedy counterattack with Frosty
racing down the wing. He played the
ball round the centre back leaving
Fringe with just the goalie to beat.
Could he do it? Yes, he could. The ball
nestled in the back of the net and it
was suddenly game on. IQ got back
into the game and the momentum
swung from Sevilla to ICUAFC.
Brownfinger and Uptight supported
IQ and the wingers, Nob Mez and
Scurvy were causing all sorts of
trouble on the touchline. However
fatigue set in and with just minutes
left on the clock Rakitic completed
his trick winning the game for Sevilla.
Sevilla FC are due back in England
for the away leg in November, but it is
hard to see them getting anything at
the Fortress.
Wednesday meant a change of
scenery with the second half of the
trip to Seville. To make the most of
the afternoon, everyone except The
Milky Bar Big, who was AWOL, went
on a walking tour to take in as much
culture as humanly possible.
The final footballing encounter
saw ICUAFC taking part in the 56th
anniversary celebrations of a local
club. After being presented with the
trophy before kick-off ICUAFC were
feeling complacent and this lead to
conceding 3 early goals. After some
stern words at half time ICUAFC got
one back. Frankel instinctively played
it over the top, sending the ball home
over the onrushing keeper. Despite
Alfonso’s best Alfonso impressions
the equaliser was one step too far and
another disappointing defeat ensued.
Fears Plaque was crowned Player of
Tour and Alfred, Ian and Isa were
thanked for translating for the week
and not letting anyone die. There
was then just time for one last trip
to Belindo, which was unanimously
declared the best night-club in the
world.
The next day was home time. It had
been an emotional week and everyone
had come out of it a bigger man. The
flight back was uneventful although it
was delayed due to a problem with the
left falanage.
We returned back to the misery
of modern Britain but we were all
relieved to be back, in the motherland
and return to our families, where our
Mums could cook us dinner and wash
our clothes and cuddle us through our
tears.

It was an early start. The team of 10
gathered at the motor club garage
at 1.00 on Saturday morning for the
250 mile drive up North for the 7.00
circuit briefing. With bleary eyes and
all the racing gear and camping kit
thrown into the back of the minibus
we set off up the M1.
After much sleep, a traditional
McDonalds breakfast and a colourful
sunrise greeted us with much
appreciation. And as a bonus, no rain!
A two-hour practice and qualifying
session was enough to wake most
of us up, in blisteringly fast karts
capable of 70mph! The 1.3km track
at Teeside Autodrome was very fast
with a mixture of high-speed corners
and challenging chicanes, with the
practice giving us all a taster of just
how much of a challenge 24 hours on
track will be. Jon Pring set the fastest
time of the team, qualifying us in
12th place out of 40 teams. However,
the race was far from over with 24
hours for anything to happen.
At 13.00, we positioned ourselves
on the grid. The first driver out,
Geoffrey Marcel lined up on the other
side of the track, waiting with focus
and calmly for the Union Jack to
drop. For this was a Classic Le Mans
style start where the drivers run over
the track to their vehicles, so athletic
ability and reaction times were key.
The start was good, we cheered
Geoffrey on as he gained 4 places in
his first lap. But this was a long game,
so we left him to settle into his 1hr
long stint. Our team strategy was to
stay on track, look after the tyres and
minimize kart damage by staying off
the kerbs.
Drivers Thilanka Jayasekera,
Thomas Jones, Thomas Arscott,
Charlies Osio, Tianquin Bao,
Anthony Vaquero, & Arnaud
Wolfer all put in very impressive
performances throughout the
afternoon and night, alternating
between pit stop crew, driving and
sleeping. For many of these drivers it
was their first ever race.
After much barbequed breakfast,
lunch, and dinner, the race was
finally coming to a close. Jon took the
final session, gaining on the previous
race leaders, Oxford University,
and a tired Oxford driver found the
pressure too great, forcing their kart
into a spin! We crossed the chequered
flag in a respectable 27th with many
memories of such a great race, and
already planning on how to improve
our performance for next year.
Fancy joining us? We can usually be
found in our garage on Unwin Road
restoring our Classic Mini, which we
are planning to rebuild the engine in
the autumn term.
New to this year, we will be hosting
a cheap karting championship
throughout the season and aiming to
continue our success in the British
Universities Karting Championship
across the country.
