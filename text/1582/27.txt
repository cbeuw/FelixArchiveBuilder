Imperial College Aid to the Balkans on their work with underprivileged children
In June 2014, five of us from Imperial
College London represented Imperial
College Aid to the Balkans (ICAB) on
a volunteer program in Bulgaria at a
town called Gorna Oryahovitsa.
ICAB supports orphanages and
day centres for children in Bulgaria.
We worked at one such day centre
in Gorna, which provides social
and developmental support for
all children, including those with
disabilities, whilst the parents are at
work.
We worked with two groups of
children: one group with severely
notable disabilities such as cerebral
palsy and the other with mild
disabilities such as ADHD.
The day centre was impressive with
a functioning gym and playground,
but the children lacked playmates
and the caretakers didn’t have much
time to play with them. Hence
our primary role and focus was on
providing the children with much-
needed attention through activities
which stimulated and engaged their
interests and development. We
couldn’t communicate verbally due
to the language barrier, but using
actions with sincerity, the team
forged strong friendships with the
children.
With time, we better understood
the children and were able to
adjust our games to increase their
enjoyment.
Each day the kids played with
something new such as balls, frisbees
and bubbles. All of the toys we
bought were funded by the £80 we
raised through a cake sale we held
at Imperial. On two of the days we
drew the children’s silhouette and let
them colour it, which was planned
by two local volunteers who did us a
big favour in terms of the language
barrier. We helped children with
walking difficulties to walk and on
our last day, we organized a mini
party with face paints and balloon
sculptures to conclude our time with
them. The kids really enjoyed it!
On our first free weekend, we went
to neighbouring Romania to visit a
few castles in Transylvania, including
Dracula’s very own! To experience the
wild Transylvanian scenery, we drove
along the Transfagarasan, named
by Top Gear as the most beautiful
road in the world - imagine driving
through a flock of sheep and having
lunch by a glacial lake in heavy snow
(in June) !
The following weekend we went
to Varna, a city by the Black Sea,
to soak up all the sunshine we
missed in London. We also went to
Bulgaria’s most celebrated tourist
attraction, Rila monastery, nestled
in the mountains, to admire the
best of Bulgarian art, culture and
architecture. These are places
where lovers of nature, culture and
adventure will all have an amazing
time like we did.
Our time in Bulgaria was truly an
eye opening experience. It allowed
us to view the world in a different
light and further understand the
plight of the unfortunate. It also gave
us a better insight into the history
of the country and of how Bulgaria
has transformed throughout the
years. This was certainly a journey of
self-discovery and our way of giving
back to the community through
interaction with the locals.
ICAB strongly supports the
development of both its volunteers
and the target community and we
would highly recommend anyone
interested in giving back to the
community to take up this program.

Imperial Hub: Make your Mark
Ever wondered what consulting is all
about? Many of you may have heard
of this for the first time recently,
but alongside the lucrative banking
and finance industry, big bucks are
now coming to consulting. And it
shouldn’t come as a surprise because
some of the biggest real world
problems are solved by consultancies.
In 2013, the UK Management
Consultancies Association (MCA)
reported an 8% annual growth in the
consulting sector, beating most other
key industries. As more companies
turn to consultancies for solutions to
their problems, it is with no surprise
Consulting the students of Imperial
that this industry is set to grow, by
helping the other industries grow.
You might still be puzzled as to
exactly what consulting is. Let’s
assume we have a problem. Your firm
wants to launch a new product but
do not know how to. As the boss of
the company, there would be many
questions running through your
mind – how much are you going to
price it, where are you going to make
the product available, and the list
goes on. You can get the answers to
these questions by randomly finding
a figure or answer and wish upon
all your luck that you got it right, or
you could find the answer through
a systematic, analytical and logical
method of surveying, benchmarking
and obtaining a good strategy with
projections. That is what consultants
do: providing answers to problems
and questions through a scientific,
methodological and quantifiable
approach.
As a consultant, you help firms
save millions of dollars, build
competencies in clients, and make
a positive difference that lasts.
Every project you work on would be
different, and while your job gets
filled with vibrancy, you get a strong
sense of fulfilment too from all the
positive difference that you have
created.
For everyone in Imperial who is
keen to join this exciting industry, the
Imperial College Consultancy Society
(ICCS) would be your leading student-
led organisation that not just provides
you a touch-point to the industry, but
platforms for you to gain valuable
skills and competencies. Here at ICCS,
our primary goal is to help every
member to our fullest extent achieve
their ambitions towards a career in
consultancy.
We hold a variety of events where
we bring to campus top notch
consulting firms – opportunities for
you to learn about them, as well as to
create networks that might one day be
useful for your future endeavours.
If you are looking for more than
just learning about consulting firms,
then join our in-house Case Study
Club, or even our subsidiary, the
Imperial Consulting Group (ICG),
where you will get an opportunity
to hone your analytical skills and
logical reasoning. ICG even offers
you real life opportunities to work
with established clients solving real
problems.
There is so much you can expect
in consulting, because at every
point, it changes. The most difficult
challenges are structured and solved
by consultancies. If you are keen to
learn more about consulting, or wish
to prepare yourself for a career in
consulting, ICCS will be a must-join.
Purchase our free membership from
the Imperial College Union website
and you would be entitled to attend
our career presentations, as well as
enrichment activities, for free.

you to visit us at our stand at the
Freshers’ Fair.

As a Fresher you will quickly realise
that University is an amazing time
to make friends and experience
new things, especially in a city like
London. It is also a perfect time to
start thinking about how you can
make a mark on the world around
you.
Sadly as students we can often be
portrayed in a bad light in the media,
however things are quickly changing
as University students everywhere
are proving that they have the power
and potential to shape a better world.
Recently an edible water bottle
designed to reduce plastic waste was
shortlisted as one of five ideas that
could radically change the world.
It was a student at Imperial who
designed it.
Imperial Hub is a community
of students working to create
opportunities for others to make a
difference. Throughout Welcome
Week we want you to think about
how you will Make Your Mark and
drive positive social change whilst at
Imperial. Whether you can imagine
yourself inspiring young school
students, using your tech skills to
help charities with web design or even
starting your own social enterprise,
there will be something that you can
do to get involved!
You might not realise it, but the
opportunity to effect change is right
at your fingertips. While Kensington
and Chelsea seems on the surface an
extremely affluent area, it actually
faces huge social inequalities and has
the biggest gap between high and low
earners in London. 35%of primary
school students in the borough are
on Free Schools Meals (because their
parents have a combined income of
less than £15,190) compared to the
national average of 19%.
Students at Imperial have been
engaging with these issues and other
similar ones throughout London
through various ways with Imperial
Hub.
Last year over 100 Schools Plus
tutors were able to inspire and engage
over 450 disadvantaged school pupils
across London, helping to improve
results and bridge gaps between
school and university.
This year we are pleased to
announce that the Schools Plus
tutoring programme will be
growing even bigger and better
as we merge with the Pimlico
Connection and Imperial College’s
Outreach Department. One of our
past volunteers said: “I've gained
so many amazing experiences and
skills... I would never have gotten my
summer internship if it wasn’t for

"You might
not realise
it, but the
opportunity
to effect
change
is right
at your
fingertips. "
the experience and skills I’d gained
during my time as Schools Plus
Coordinator.”
So now it is your turn to think about
how could you best utilise your time
at Imperial. Getting involved with
social action doesn’t have to mean
changing your routine; volunteering
just one hour a week can make a huge
difference! Not to mention getting
involved is hugely rewarding – you
can meet great people and gain lots
of new skills and experiences for the
future.
" You can
meet great
people and
gain lots
of new
skills and
experiences
for the
future. "
