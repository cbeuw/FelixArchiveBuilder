Meet Chris, your friend in welfare
Welcome! I’m Chris, your Deputy
President (Welfare), and here are
some tips to make the most of your
time in London while also looking
after yourself. At times the first term
will feel like being hit by a breeze-
block in the night. Life at Imperial is
intense, with many different academ-
ic, societal and social pursuits requir-
ing your time – but it is important to
remember that we need to find the
right balance for us. Achieving this
balance is vital to maintaining your
wellbeing and looking after yourself!
Food
During Freshers’ Week your diet may
consist broadly of burgers, kebabs and
the like. That’s entirely understand-
able, but it is also important to re-
member that when your studies start,
your diet can have a big effect on your
ability to focus and concentrate. A
good diet also makes you look and
feel good! Cooking isn’t that hard, and
the Food Section often carries some
easy recipes to enjoy. There are also
many healthy options on Campus.
Homesickness
It’s normal to feel homesick, espe-
cially if you’ve moved country to
study here. But everyone, even if they
don’t show it, will be feeling the same
way. Just power through and make
the most of the social opportunities
provided at the start of term.
Nightlife Safety
London has some of the most varied
nightlife in the world, with all sorts of
different experiences to
be had. Here are some pro-tips if
you’re going out for a night on the
town:
• Know your route home before
you go. There’s nothing worse
than being stuck in the middle of
London, with a flat (or missing!)
phone and no idea how to get
back.
• If you are drinking alcohol, try
to pace yourself. Alternating
between alcoholic and non-alco-
holic drinks is a good idea.
Chris Kaye’s job is to care for your welfare. Here’s his tips.
• Pre-drinking is common and
(let’s face it) fun. However you
shouldn’t feel peer pressured
into drinking something you
don’t want to!
• Don’t leave your drink unattend-
ed. You never know what people
might put in it. Equally don’t
accept a drink from strangers;
always watch your drink being
made.
• Drugs and alcohol do not mix.
And even if you’re not drinking,
never buy drugs in a club.
• Be wary of clubs offering special
promotions to women. Not just
because it violates the Union’s
equality policy(!) but also because
a club that sees women in that
way probably isn’t a very nice
environment.
• Look after your friends. Travel
there and back in a group, and
don’t just disappear without
telling them. Decide amongst
yourselves before you head out
what happens if one of you ‘pulls’
and who will travel back with
whom in that situation.
• Never use unlicensed minicabs.
Pre-book your ride from a repu-
table firm. Worst case scenario if
everything goes wrong, just pay
for a black cab home. At least
you’re safe.
• Dress appropriately. Not just for
the variable London weather,
but walking home from central
London is no fun in heels (or so
I’m told)!
Safe Sex
In the event you have sexual inter-
course while at Imperial, it’s impor-
tant to remember to use protection
against Sexually Transmitted Infec-
tions. If you do have unprotected sex
and require emergency contraception
or if you would like to get tested for
an STI then visit the Imperial Health
Centre or Earl’s Court Health and
Wellbeing Centre. The Union gives
out free condoms and look out for our
Shag Week and our STI clinics held
throughout the year.
Sleep
There’s no shame in occasionally hav-
ing a night in, in fact good sleep pat-
terns are crucial to your health. Also,
if you’re absolutely knackered it’s
rather difficult to enjoy social events.
It’s a good opportunity to get to know
people in halls, maybe watch a film
or shoot some pool. Also, on Monday
13th October, the Union is holding an
event called Dri, an alcohol-free night
with entertainment (featuring a rodeo
bull!) and a DJ. Open to all.
Drugs
Realistically we know some of you
will choose to take drugs, and the
Union provides access to non-judge-
mental information about drugs,
what precautions to take, and what
to do in case of emergency. As well
as your safety, it is also important to
consider the serious implications of
being found with drugs, particularly
on College grounds. Visit the Union
website for more information.
