"If anyone
who knows
anybody
who would
like their
name on
the front
of our
library, let
us know!"
"90% of
negative
comments
regarding
the Library
said it was
simply too
hot."
The Central Library has seen major
redevelopments over the summer to
introduce new study spaces, facilities
and technological aids. A new
assistive technology room has been
installed on Level 1, 200 new study
spaces have been introduced on Level
3, and a whole new facility has been
instated on Level 4 for a Centre of
Doctorate Training. They also, among
other things, plan to introduce an
iPad loan scheme in the near future.
Towards the end of the last
academic year, it was also announced
by Felix that air conditioning may
finally be installed. However, Felix
has now found that installation of the
fabled air conditioning system has
now been put on hold.
Planning permission for a cooling
unit to be placed on the Sherfield
Building roof was granted before the
summer period by the Chelsea and
Westminster Council. This cooling
unit, alongside the installation of
cooling beams in the ceilings, would
have provided adequate climate
control that would have hopefully
cooled off the hotter floors of the
library, which are known to be almost
subtropical in nature during the
summer months.
The proposed cooling beams are
designed to drop pockets of cool air
should the temperature get too high,
although their function demands
an increase in electronic usage. The
installation of these cooling beams
would have therefore required a
complete overhaul of the electronic
infrastructure, something that caused
a hike in the price of the installations.
This coupled with the necessity to
only work intensively around the
clock during the summer, so as to
minimise disruption to Library users
during term time, the installation was
budgeted at more than the College
were willing to spend.
Installation of the cooling beams
was therefore considered a high
risk project given its feasibility
and price; coupled with the risk of
disturbing campus neighbours with
the construction work, the College
decided to deny the project funding.
Allegedly, orders had already been
placed on some equipment for the
climate control provisions before
funding was denied.
The Library initially appealed to
the College with refurbishment plans
worth around £27m. These proposals
covered the climate control plans
alongside other redevelopments, and
after re-evaluation of the budgets, the
Library received between five and six
million in total. However, this would
not have covered the air conditioning
installation, so the plans for the
cooling beams have been stalled.
Felix spoke to Chris Banks, the
Director of Central Library, about the
situation.
“The key thing now is identifying
the funding needed. If anyone who
knows anybody who would like their
name on the front of our library, let
us know!
The crucial thing for students is
to make their voice heard. This is
a problem and has been a problem
students have been talking about this
for years.”
The approval process for the
expenditure of the redevelopment
encompassed many senior members
of College staff including previous
Rector, Sir Keith O’Nions. One
anonymous source said that O’Nions
was allegedly reluctant to approve
the budget because he didn’t think
students were bothered by the heat:
“he apparently had never received any
emails from students complaining
about the heat, so didn’t think it was
a concern.”
So could we still have climate
control provisions in place in
the future if the College were to
change their minds? For now, it
looks unlikely. However, after Felix
contacted college’s Operations
Division who oversee various
redevelopment projects on campus,
they said that “the timeframe for
installation will be linked to other
major works planned for the Library
as part of the ongoing programme.
Library users will be kept informed of
plans once the likely start date for the
work has been determined.”
There is no guarantee of funding
for next summer, although the
demand for a climate control system
in the library is high. In the NSS
responses this year, 90% of negative
comments regarding the Library said
it was simply too hot in the summer
months, whilst Library’s own Space
Survey found that most students
identified the heat as an issue.
This is not the first time attempt
to introduce air cooling systems into
the Library. Previously, planning
permission was requested to instate
an external cladding across the
Library that would have reduced
the external heating of the building
while leaving the internal climate
unchanged. However, permission for
this was denied, and it was back to
square one for the Central Library.
On 25th June, it was announced
that Imperial College London had
purchased a new sports ground in
Heston, a site that, according to the
College, "represents an excellent
opportunity for College sports.”
Due to this new purchase, Sport
Imperial also announced that
they were then going to halt sport
at Teddington, a sports ground
frequented by the medic sports teams
and steeped in medic tradition and
history. The College announced that
“whilst no formal decision has been
made there are no plans for student
sport to take place at Teddington in
the future.”
The announcement lead to a public
outcry from medical students, who
assembled in their hundreds to sign
an online petition against the closure.
Many cited the issue of requiring
a longer travel time to the Heston
grounds, although most were angry
at the closure of a site that had been
used for almost a century.
In another statement by Imperial
College Union, it was stated that
although the Union President of the
last academic year, David Goldsmith,
was privy to the information
concerning the purchase of Heston,
he was unable to tell other students
due to the “commercial sensitivity” of
the topic.
The Student Consultation
Framework set by David Goldsmith
in the last year was completely
ignored during the process. No other
Sabbatical Officers were aware of the
purchase, or the effect it would have
on Teddington, until it was finalised.
In an email that went out to the
Medical School earlier in September,
Dariush Hassanzadeh-Baboli, the
current ICSMSU President, detailed
how the decision to close Teddington
had been made without any student
consultation. He went on to say that
“big decisions that disrupt the history
and traditions of our Medical School,
should not be made without the
students being thoroughly consulted.”
But why was the purchase of Heston
kept so hush-hush? And why were
no students consulted on closure of
Teddington?
Heston was previously owned by
British Airways (BA), which was
then known as the British Airways
Concorde Club, and was used by their
staff for recreational purposes. Union
sources have told Felix that the
College was keen to avoid upsetting
the members of the BA staff, who
have previously gone on strike in the
past. Not only that, but the College
was not the only interested buyer for
the site.
Felix met with the current Deputy
President (Clubs and Societies) Abi de
Bruin and Dariush earlier this month
to discuss what had happened since
the announcement.
Dariush stressed how even since the
announcement, Sport Imperial have
been difficult to get straight answers
from, which has led to further
friction between the Medics and Sport
Imperial. Dariush said, “it’s taken two
months to get answers about this.
I’ve been asking Neil Moseley [Head
of Sport Imperial] questions and not
being able to get straight answers... he
wouldn’t give me adequate answers,
although there were still things
he was unsure about.” Organising
meetings with the College over the
summer in regards to the move to
Heston also proved difficult. Trying
to organise a meeting with Simon
Harding Roots [Head of Imperial’s
Operations group, which oversees
operating services on campus] took
two months according to Dariush.
Said Abi, “[For some people] it became
impossible to get replies over the
summer.”
Moseley also initially denied the
Medics any access to the grounds
once the decision had been made to
close them. Dariush said that they
were told that “there is no way we
can have any access to Teddington
from September and [they] wouldn’t
even compromise with any sort
of day, such as a celebration day.”
However, two final days have now
been negotiated for use of the site,
although Dariush was keen to point
out this was potentially facilitated
by Debra Humphries, the Pro-
Rector (Education), as opposed to
representatives from Sport Imperial.
But will Heston even be ready for
the start of term? Two rugby pitches
have been lost with the closure of
Teddington, although there are plans
to put a second rugby pitch in Heston
as compensation. However, the
organisation of this has also caused
issues. Said Dariush, “I can see it being
an absolute state at the beginning of
the season.”
Although the College no longer
pays for the upkeep of Teddington,
the College still owns the ground
and a local school in the area now
pays for its upkeep. The current
staffing system for both Teddington
and Heston sites is also being
restructured, with people having
to reapply for new jobs in the new
system.
Dariush detailed particular concern
for one popular groundskeeper who
has been there for 15 years and has a
strong relationship with the students.
Said Dariush, “we are quite concerned
about him, he’s part of the Medical
School in principle. We tried to get an
answer from [Sport Imperial] but did
not receive a straight answer again.”
Abi said that overall however, “some
jobs will likely be lost.”
So what is the future for
Teddington? It seems that the College
are adamant that student sport will
never return to the site, but it has left
more students upset than concerned
over the move that has lacked
any sort of student consultation
whatsoever. Said Abi, “They are
continually doing things that have
commercial sensitivity and then
using [that] as a blanket to not say a
word to anybody and not put proper
provisions in place.”
Dariush succinctly summed the
fears up of the students affected: “we
fear that students at Imperial are
not being treated as a major priority;
profits and prestige appear to come
first.”
