“Leadership for Development”
(LfD). These sessions are given
by experienced researchers and
professional engineers, to help you
acquire the tools to finance, plan and
deliver a successful overseas project.
We want to see a world without
poverty and without barriers to
human development – where
everyone can meet their basic needs,
can live in dignity, can create and
can flourish. No matter your area of
expertise or your career plan, you can
contribute to building a sustainable
and fair future for others.
Marcus Bishop discusses the opportunities for EWB volunteers
Engineers Without Borders UK
Many people in our world face severe
challenges even just to live. Engineers
Without Borders UK is a charitable
organisation that believes that access
to engineering and technical know-
how can help overcome many of these
challenges.
Our work aims to demonstrate
the link between engineering and
humanity, a connection which is
often neglected in our education and
in practice.
EWB Imperial, a branch of EWB
UK, is a well-established society
providing opportunities for Imperial
students, local school children and
our international partners. We are
a gathering of environmentally and
socially conscious engineers and non-
engineers, engaging in meaningful
projects which create Massive Small
Change both locally and abroad. The
mission is simply to empower human
development through engineering.
EWB members have established
many successful projects, most
notably Raincatcher Imperial – a
group focussing on water provision
for poor communities in Tanzania,
and now a charity in its own right.
In London, EWB Imperial Outreach
works with local school groups to
help inspire the next generation
of engineers through hands-on
workshops designed and delivered
by Outreach volunteers. This year
we hope to double the number of
opportunities to local students,
focussing particularly on engaging
children from disadvantaged
backgrounds. Volunteers involved
in Outreach find it a rewarding
experience, and a platform for
enhancing group management and
event planning abilities.
In September 2013, EWB Imperial
embarked on an International
Partnership with SIBAT, an
alternative technology charity in the
Philippines. A research trip to three
isolated rainforest villages in the
North of the country exposed a rare
insight into the difficult lives of the
Nabuangan people.
EWB is now connecting
engineering talent at Imperial to
the daily problems faced by many
living in rural Philippines, and just 12
months, on a shoestring budget, our
design team has developed a system
for managing power in Nabuangan
Hydropower schemes.
The next phase is to further
improve the technology to ensure
that it can survive in the humid
rainforest climate, before installing
the system during Summer 2015.
The design team is open to
enthusiastic and motivated students
from all disciplines, and offers a
unique chance to contribute from
drawing board through to application
in the field.
Our thoughts go out to the
thousands in the main Island of
Luzon, who have recently weathered
Typhoon Kalmaegi. The severity and
frequency of Typhoons hitting the
Philippines has been trending up
in the last decade, and the repeated
devastation to the poorest in society
is a serious concern for the future.
EWB is incubating many alternative
technology projects related to
typhoon survival systems, ready for
multi-disciplinary teams to explore
the problems faced on a local scale,
and engineer innovative, low cost
solutions.
The challenges faced during
International Development projects
are quite different from any you
might experience on your course.
One must observe, interact and
consult with all the local stakeholders
to gain a complete understanding of
the barriers to development. Many
engineers are able to work through
the technical aspects of a project,
but only a handful have the range
of skills necessary to overcome
linguistic, political and practical
obstacles and create positive change.
EWB Imperial is runing a series
of scenario-based workshops called
Tackling global challenges with e.quinox
It is not often that one has the
opportunity to actually feel like you
are making a difference. Too often
instead the vast nature of global
challenges seems to nullify our
efforts. Nevertheless, for ten Imperial
College students this summer having
a role in combating poverty seemed
like a very vivid reality. Rather than
looking for the ever sought after
summer internship, these students
decided to head off to Rwanda.
Together with the rest of the e.quinox
team, they are trying to bring cheap
electricity to rural communities
across the world.
A lack of electricity might not
seem like a problem for a family
earning less than £1 a day, but this is
a common misconception. Access to
affordable electricity has been shown
to have a positive impact on health,
education, and is a primary necessity
for local business to flourish. These
families spend a significant amount
of their earnings on kerosene, candles
and phone recharges. Kerosene in
particular is expensive, polluting,
unsafe and unhealthy. A clean
electrical light source allows families
to safely study or work even after the
sun has set.
To this date, e.quinox’s focus
has been to provide access to clean
lighting. This summer for the first
time the feasibility of a larger scale
project is being tested. Building on
the hydroelectric plant constructed
in the summer of 2012, the team is
assessing the possibility of building
a micro-grid in a nearby village.
The idea is to combine the power
generated by the hydro plant with
solar home systems (SHS), which
use solar panels and batteries to
generate and store electricity. This
would allow connected customers to
be both consumers and producers of
electricity. If successful, this would
be the first example of a micro-grid,
which grows in size and stability as
more customers join it.
In order to do so, the team in
Rwanda is now surveying a possible
route for the transmission line,
carrying out geotechnical and
structural investigations, and
collecting data on the business case
for it.
Although the information collected
this summer is key, crucial work for
the success of the project will be done
during term time in London. The
current turbine design needs to be
improved and then manufactured.
The business model still needs to be
finalised using the data collected.
Furthermore, using the estimated
energy consumption, a suitable SHS
needs to be designed and tested to
ensure the stability of this micro-grid.
e.quinox has always been a
champion of development through
local entrepreneurship. Aid
creates dependency, whereas a
business generates profits for the
local community and aims to the
empower those within it.
"Too often
the vast
nature
of global
challenges
seems to
nullify our
efforts."
"If
successful,
this would
be the first
example of
a micro-
grid."

excel, and thus the degrees offered by
Imperial College, especially science,
engineering or mathematics, are
excellent preparation for the rigors of
the legal profession.
Beyond the transferable skills,
however, these degrees are extremely
relevant to their related practice
areas in law. For instance, a science
degree is valuable in deciphering the
technical terms in a pharmaceutical
patent in intellectual property law,
and mathematical skills will give
you an edge in tax and accounting
law. Graham Forrest, a life sciences
PhD graduate from Imperial College,
now working as a patent attorney,
recapitulates this, saying that law
is “just as intellectually stimulating
as academia, but offers better job
security and potential for career
progression”.
So what are the routes to becoming
a solicitor or barrister? Firstly, you

Alexander Beaghton discusses how you too could be a lawyer
Attention Imperial College students:
you could become a lawyer. This may
sound like a strange thing to say at a
University that does not offer a law
degree, but did you know that almost
half of the new lawyers in the UK did
not read law as undergraduates? If
you are studying science, engineering
or mathematics, you may be in a
prime position to exploit a niche in
the legal market. You could end up
working in the City with a salary
similar to investment banking, or
advising clients on the forefront of
new technologies and discoveries,
where your expertise and analytical
skills gained at Imperial lend you a
tactical advantage.
It is no secret that banking and
finance are still highly popular
options for Imperial graduates,
regardless of the recession. In 2011,
over a quarter of physics graduates
from Imperial College were recruited
into the financial profession.
Yet in an increasingly regulated
banking environment, where bonuses
are slashed and the freedom to trade
is slowly being suffocated, the work
– and the recognition – is shifting to
the City lawyers. While banking is
becoming increasingly saturated with
STEM graduates, lawyers with science
and engineering backgrounds are still
the exception rather than the rule.
You may be wondering how you
can possibly transfer to law from a
science, engineering, or mathematics
degree. Yet regardless of what stage
you are at in your degree, there is
a clear and defined path for you
to enter into the legal profession.
In fact, Lord Sumption, Justice of
the Supreme Court in the UK, has
said that “the study of a subject
which comes close to pure logic, like
mathematics, is at least as valuable a
preparation for legal practice as the
study of law”.
As standard undergraduate law
degrees are increasingly less of a
requirement for law firms, graduate
recruiters are actively searching for
graduates with non-legal degrees that
will offer different transferable skills.
Many top intellectual property and
life sciences firms, such as Bristows
LLP or Bird & Bird LLP, already
specifically target Imperial College
graduates and even postgraduates,
meaning that studying at Imperial
gives you a strong head start.
It is common knowledge that
the work of a solicitor or barrister
involves handling large amounts of
information, interpreting complex
legislation and drafting intricate
documents. As a result, logical minds
will have to take the GDL (Graduate
Diploma in Law) following your
undergraduate degree, which
will bring you up to par with law
graduates. This is followed with
another year of more specialized
study, either branching into the LPC
(Legal Practice Course) to become a
solicitor or into the Bar Professional
Training Course to become a
barrister.
To receive your law degree, these
two years of law education are
followed by training at a law firm or
barrister’s chambers. Though it is not
particularly difficult to gain places
on the law courses, being accepted
for a training contract (solicitor)
or a pupillage (barrister) is a highly
competitive process. For non-law
students, applications to training
contracts can be submitted on the
final year of your undergraduate
degree. If you are successful, both
Law: is this the career for you?
years of law school are subsidized at
many top firms, sometimes with an
additional hefty maintenance grant.
The application process may be
tough, but thankfully Imperial
College has its own dedicated Law
Society, committed to helping
undergraduates through every
stage of the journey towards a legal
career. The committee members are
on campus to help students from
an initial interest in a legal career
to the ins and outs of building CVs
and applications. Most importantly,
the law society is part of a network
consisting of both top City firms
and the diversity-focused group
Aspiring Solicitors, all of which are
hosting events either at the College
or their offices. These events will be
opportunities for undergraduates to
learn about life as a lawyer, ask any
questions and get vital application
advice from graduate recruiters and
legal trainees themselves.
"It is no
secret that
banking
and
finance are
still highly
popular
options for
Imperial
graduates."
"There is a
clear and
defined
path for
you to
enter into
the legal
profession"
