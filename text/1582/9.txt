“I came from
a generation
that listened
to The
Smiths and
thought that
misery and
intellect were
synonymous.”
BF: Why don't you tell me a little
bit about yourself, and why you
want to be the next Dean?
TW: I grew up in North London on
a council estate, and today turning
up at the place that when I was young
was the place to be to study science
still shocks me. I do my research and
my teaching, but how can I make
someone else feel like that when
they’re here? I want to make other
people want to come here.
I went to Sussex, having missed
my offer to Bristol. This was pretty
lucky, as Harry Kroto [discoverer
of Buckminsterfullerene] was
my Physical Chemistry tutor. I
remember the first time that he
came in and told me: “it’s a football”.
Looking back now, that was a real
‘blow your mind moment’.
I’m an inorganic chemist by
training. I’ve been at Imperial for
quite a while now. When I started
there hadn’t been a job for an
inorganic chemist advertised in the
country in years, then all of a sudden
all the top departments advertised
within a couple of weeks of each
other. The first one that I went
to interview at was Durham, and
before the interview one of the other
candidates asked me where I would
go if I could to do any of the top four
Chemistry departments in the UK.
Rather cheekily, I said Imperial! I
guess that’s why I want to be Dean,
because I cared even before I started
here.
BF: So what are your big ideas for
the faculty?
TW: Well to start, let me just say
that we’re not broken – what we’d be
doing is guilding the lily, working
upon something that’s already highly
successful. We want to promote
openness and inclusion.
I also want to remind people that
a career in science isn’t a golden
conveyor belt – I didn’t go to my first
choice university, and I didn’t get a
first class degree, or make the initial
probation. Fundamentally I think
that people need to be reminded that
those of us doing science aren’t the
brightest and the top of our class with
a completely omnipotent personality,
we’re human too. We struggle when
we need to and find it easy when we
need to. Sometimes I think that as an
institution that doesn’t come across.
I’d also like to change the culture
to be a little more welcoming. If I see
someone in welcome week trying to
find a building named after a dead
person, I always try to give them a
hand. That doesn’t always happen, but
we should try and maybe be a little
less competitive. Hopefully Imperial
will be a little more welcoming, a
little bit better tomorrow than it was
yesterday.
BF: So that quite clearly links to
student involvement, what would
you change that students would
want to see improved, for example
mental health support?
TW: Well this is a difficult one.
I think that the college’s crisis
management support services are
fantastic, but the problems come
before that stage. We need a mutually
supportive environment, where the
little things matter. You’re never too
busy to be nice to someone!
It’s weird really. I’m always happy,
but I came from a generation
that listened to the Smiths and
thought that misery and intellect
were synonymous, whilst negative
emotions were the only profound
ones. I think that we need to make
sure that we challenge these ideas,
some of which still persist today. A
lot of the time the assumption is that
because I’m happy I must be thick – it
just doesn’t work like that!
BF: So if you ever got a student
knocking on your door as Dean,
you wouldn't turn them away?
TW: God no! I never mind being
stopped by students.
BF: Hmm. So, what do you think
of Imperial West and Acton?
TW: What a fantastic opportunity!
When it stops being a concept and
starts being a thing, it’ll be brilliant.
With regard to Acton, I understand
why students are a little weary. What
happens there depends on lots of
things, and whilst it might feel now
like a bit of a bum deal, buildings last
a long time! They grow, and maybe in
the future they’ll seem better.
"I also want
to remind
people that
a career
in science
isn't a
golden
conveyor
belt."
