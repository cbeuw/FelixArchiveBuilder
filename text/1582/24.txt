"Freshers'
Week
marked the
end of my
bookworm
habits."
Fresher’s Week marked the end my
bookworm habits. The shockwave of
University life knocked me over with
distractions: meeting too many new
people, learning how to put together
something more than a bowl of cereal,
and, of course, attending lectures
(otherwise known as managing your
sleep debt). So in case you struggle
saying no to that after-party, here’s a
little help in saying yes to finishing
that Tolstoy instead.
Step 1. How to find non-
science related books around
campus
Level 5, Central Library: Please don’t
become one of those students about to
graduate who still doesn’t know about
this sanctuary in the otherwise not-so-
sanctuary-like library. (Or that they
have a good selection on Dostoyevsky.)
With the doors of the library open
24 hours, instead of heading for that
kebab to curb your 4am munchies, go
and pick up a gothic horror story to
read under the full moon.
ICSF Library: Run by the Imperial
College Science FRun by the Imperial
College Science Fiction and Fantasy
Society, this enchanting space holds
more than 9400 books, 2200 DVDs
and 500 graphic novels. If you’re
interested in science fiction, fantasy or
horror, this is the place to be. During
term times, it is officially open every
weekday lunchtime from 12:00–14:00,
but the pull of the ICSF library is
almost always strong enough to trap
at least one committee member in
the library well after lectures end. To
borrow books you need to be an ICSF
member, which costs £8 per year.
Step 2. How to meet fellow
bookworms around campus
This can be a tricky one, especially
This can be a tricky one, especially
meeting practising bookworms.
However, your chances will increase
immensely if you are a member of the
following societies.
Book Club: With monthly
meetings, thereWith monthly
meetings, there is plenty of time
to read whatever book has been
chosen by the current members
(by democratic vote). The chosen
novels can be bought from the club
committee at a reduced price (usually
around £2-£5); or, like me, you can try
to find them in the Central Library,
with occasional success. The books
chosen last year were laudable –
absorbing, diverse and short enough
to be read easily within a month. With
membership costing only £3, this was
my saviour last year (alas, even reading
can be helped by deadlines and peer
pressure).
Science Fiction and Fantasy: I’ll
say it again: 9400 books, 2200 DVDs
and 500 graphic novels. In the Beit
Quad. For £8 a year. But if you need
any more convincing, join the society
for book crawls around London’s
best SF&F booksellers, regular video
showings, cinema outings and an end
of the year trip to Hay-on-Wye, a
small town in Wales with the greatest
density of second hand bookshops
per person in the UK. The society also
organises Picocon in February, an
annual convention showcasing guest
authors, book sales, special events and
games. Sold?
Step 3. How to take advantage
of your new city
By the end of your first week at
Imperial, you will become aware of
most of the downsides of living in
London, such as the cost and size
of your accommodation and the
state of your wallet after a night’s
out. However, your awareness of the
upsides will not be correlated to the
length of time that you live here,
but to the amount of time you spend
outside of campus. So please, please,
get out (and not just to nightclubs –
they’re overrated and overpriced).
To help you, here is a short (and
hardly exhaustive!) list of some of the
upcoming literary events in London
that will hopefully whet your appetite
even further for some good old
reading.
London Literature Festival: The
Southbank hosts a range of events
exploring the power of the printed
word in changing the world for the
better. Featuring double Booker prize
winner Hilary Mantel, Stephen Fry,
controversial philosopher Slavoj
Žižek and prize-winning poets such as
Alice Oswald and Kate Tempest, the
festival concentrates on the themes
of freedom, justice and democracy. So
head down to the Southbank Centre
for an inspired way to celebrate the
power of literature to transform lives.
30 September 2014 – 13 October 2014;
Student ticket: £4-£10
Terror and Wonder: The Gothic
Imagination: Two hundred rare
objects trace 250 years of Gothic
tradition at the British Library. Come
here to explore an array of delectably
dark artefacts: books, such as the
handwritten drafts of Frankenstein
and Dracula, posters, films and, most
importantly, a vampire slaying kit.
From Marry Shelley and Bram Stoker
to Stanley Kubrick and Alexander
McQueen, this exhibition promises
to delight fans of the mysterious, the
terrifying and the macabre.
3 October 2014 – 20 January 2015;
Student ticket: £5
Bookstores: London has a wealth
of bookstores ranging from small,
specialist shops (such as comics store
Gosh! in Bloomsbury) to cater-forall
giants (like Foyles on Charing Cross
Road) that regularly hold literary
events. Reserve a place online
for stand-up shows about books,
afternoon signings or discussions
about upcoming writers.
Step 4. Write for Felix!
And finally, why not contribute to
the Felix Books section? From writing
book reviews and author profiles to
publishing your own poem or short
story, this could be a great incentive
to get some interesting reading
done. Now get back to finishing that
Tolstoy!Now get back to finishing that
