freeform comment data, because the
Union is doing a response to the NSS
results. I’ve also been doing work on
the response to the closure of the ‘post
study work visa for international
students’.
B: Can you comment on the
closure of the Evelyn Gardens
halls? What would you do it
anything like that happened again?
C: My personal view is that College
should make Evelyn Gardens halls
available for students after the
redevelopment, even if the rent is
higher, because it is still a better
situation than having to live in Acton
– where students are still paying a
high rent and have to pay travel costs.
B: Why do you not think the
Union was not listened to when
the decision was being made about
Acton halls?
C: There was a confidentiality
agreement. College had already made
a decision and signed the contract
before the ‘Against Acton’ campaign.
The campaign was too little, too late.
This is sad, but I honestly don’t think
the Union could have done anything
to have changed their mind.
B: Is there anything you want to
change this year which involves
College participation?
C: I think the counselling service
needs drastic improvement. The
wait is too long and it’s understaffed.
I think it needs more funding.
I’m working with College on the
Wellbeing task group, but I think it
won’t affect the students right here,
who need help now.
B: Do you think the average
student would be able to properly
judge how you have performed at
your job?
C: I’ve always been very wary of
saying that voters aren’t informed
enough to make decisions. I’ve always
felt strongly that people are very
intelligent and are capable of making
informed decisions. At the end of the
year, I could make a case of how I did,
and I think students should be able to
make a decision on that. I trust voters.
B: Okay, let's have some fun
questions. What is your biggest
online timewaster?
C: I don’t actually use those. I use
Wikipedia, but I’m not a big editor of
it… I read a lot of blogs and the news
online. I generally try and do that
during my lunch break than when I’m
supposed to be working. I read various
political blogs and politicalbetting.
com, not that I’m not a big gambler, I
just find it interesting.
B: With the current sabbs, if
you were trapped on a desert
island with them, who would you
collectively decide to eat first?
C: Tom Wheeler would probably
be the last survivor because he does a
lot of outdoor stuff. I would probably
be the first to go, but I don’t have
very much meat, so I might not be
a tactical first meal. That’s a very
interesting question which I can’t
answer in a diplomatic way.
B: If you had to have tinder, what
bio would you have?
C: ‘IF I had to have tinder?!’ That’s
a very hypothetical question! In my
bio I would say that I was a Chemistry
graduate, that I’m being paid in a job,
and that I am 6 foot tall, even though
I am only 5 foot 11.5. So yeah: 6 foot
tall, salary, graduate.
B: Hmm, very informative.
And positive! Which Imperial
establishment would you go for
your first date in?
C: Not the Union! Because the risk
of me running into someone I know
would be too high and too awkward
and embarrassing. Probably Eastside
bar, because it almost looks like it’s
not on a university campus at all.
B: If you were allowed to name a
Union drinking place, like h-bar or
Metric, what would you name it?
C: I’d probably name it the Holland
Club. I’d make sure it had some
personality and charm. Unlike h-bar.
B: Can you recommend any bars
or nightclubs for the Freshers? Or
any to avoid?
C: Avoid at all costs Ministry of
Sound. It’s a nightmare to get to, it’s
a bigger nightmare to get back from,
it’s overrated and they treat you like a
terrorist when you walk in because of
the metal detectors.
I’m not really a big clubber, I prefer
bars where music is quiet enough to
have a conversation.
Eastside bar has proper beer, unlike
the Union… no don’t say that!
"I decided
to donate
to the
Hardship
fund,
because not
everyone
who gets a
scholarship
needs the
money."

Chris Kaye, Deputy
President (Welfare),
Eastside enthusiast and
proud owner of a giant
portrait of the Queen
talks to Felix about his
plans for next year, his
day to day activity and
whether or not he really
thinks his role should be
abolished...
B: Where are you from, and how
has it affected your outlook on
Imperial?
C: I’m from Bristol. I suppose
Bristol isn’t that diverse, so coming
to London, specifically Imperial, has
been a very enjoyable experience for
me, meeting lots of different people
from lots of different countries. It’s
been great.
B: What do you plan to do after
your sabbatical year?
C: That’s a very good question.
Honestly, I don’t know. I’ve give
it quite a lot of thought to, but I
didn’t have time to do a lot of job
applications in the final year of my
degree last year, and then when I ran
for elections and won, I was quite
relieved.
Even if I did have a job lined up,
I would have taken the sabb year
instead, because I’ve always wanted
to contribute to the union and I’m
happy to have this job for a year.
I’m not sure about afterwards, I’m
thinking maybe patent law or just
teaching.
B: Did you always plan to run for
a sabbatical position?
C: Erm. Yes, I think so. I’ve always
been rather cynical about the Union.
And I thought ‘why not put my
money where my mouth is?”
B: Why Welfare?
C: Support for students is
something I’ve always cared very
deeply about. I think it’s an area
the College is not doing enough in,
it’s something I ought to improve.
A lot of people have a tough time
at Imperial and I don’t think the
support is there.
B: Have you been personally
affected?
C: It’s not something I want to go
into. But, yes, I’ve had issues while
I’ve been here. And I know others
who have too, and it’s not just people
who are here and struggling, some
people have left and didn’t finish
their degrees after they couldn’t cope
because the support wasn’t there. I
think it’s very sad.
B: So why did you say you think
the role of DP Education and
Welfare could be combined?
C: I’ve always thought the Union
has been rather bloated. Because
Imperial is primarily an academic
institution, I’ve always found it hard
to arbitrarily separate the roles of
education and student welfare. But,
to ‘abolish the role’ was never a part
of my manifesto! It’s something I
suspect I may change my views on as
the year progresses. At this moment
in time, I’m still cynical about the
need for five full-time officer trustees
as well as Felix editor and Medic
President.
B: Do you interact with Pascal,
Deputy President (Education) a lot?
Do you still not feel like there are
two separate jobs which need full-
time employees?
C: I’m still not convinced. But term
hasn’t properly started yet, so maybe
when 3000 new people arrive, my
views may change?
B: Does that mean that you
haven't been busy?
C: I’ve had times where I’ve been
busy and some days where I’ve
not been. Some days at the start of
August, I’ve had nothing to do but
twiddle my thumbs. Work has started
to pick up now, which I’m quite
relieved about.
B: Is this the reason why you've
decided to give away a third of
your wage?
C: Well, no. My justification for
doing that is because I think the
role is overpaid. I think there are
people who will quite happily do the
role for significantly less than the
current salary. Especially if you take
into consideration that we get free
accommodation. Even with me giving
a third of my salary away, it’s more
than sufficient to live in London.
B: How do you think the other
sabbs feel about you giving up a
third of your salary?
C: I think they’re probably
surprised I’m doing what I said I
would do.
B: Is your donation to Imperial
because you feel passionate about
supporting Imperial in general?
For example, would you donate a
significant amount of your future
salary to Imperial after you leave?
C: That’s a good question. It
depends on how Imperial develops.
I’m currently here for a year and I can
actually see where the money goes,
so it makes me keener to donate. I
originally said I would donate to the
Scholarship fund, but I decided to
donate to the Hardship fund, because
not everyone who gets a scholarship
needs the money.
B: You've said you haven't had
much work to do so far, but can
you give a day to day account?
C: Each day is different. I’ve done
some subwarden interviews in the
evenings, but that’s ended now. This
week I was looking through NSS
"Some days
at the start
of August,
I've had
nothing
to do but
twiddle my
thumbs."
"I've always
thought
the Union
has been
rather
bloated...
I'm still
cynical
about
the need
for five
full-time
officer
trustees."
