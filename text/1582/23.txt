Welcome to the Felix
Food Kitchen! Here’s
whats cooking...

FOOD EDITOR
If you’re a fresher (both UG and PG), welcome to Im-
perial and the first issue of Felix for the year; if you’re
a returning student, welcome back! I’m Caz and I’m
your Felix Food Hostess. As far as foodie experiences
and biases go, mine’s an eclectic mix: I’m a wannabe
‘bartista’ (bartender-barista), a major sucker for Chi-
nese and Japanese cuisine, a former cocktail waitress
and a current burger-takeaway prep bunny. I’ll try
eatinganythingatleastonce,though.Oh,andasare-
covering depressive, I’m a living example of how food
makes/breaks your mood and assists recovery. Yes, I
have cheat days and bad student food habits like eve-
ryone; yes,I’m still learning!
I digress. The fact we’re based in cosmopolitan Lon-
don means we’ve got relatively easy access to all sorts
of foodie perks: be it a new restaurant,café or shop to
discover; exciting deals to find, markets to browse, or
food festivals to attend. The capital (and TfL) makes
it easy to swing between a variety of cuisine styles
from all around the world, whether you’re eating it in
restaurantsorlookingforingredientstomakeityour-
self.Indianonenight,Thaianother,Italianafterthat–
wherever your mood takes you! Also given our nerdy/
geeky natures,there’s always a new time/space/mon-
ey-savingfoodiehacktodevelopin-betweenproblem
sets.
As it’s the start of the academic year, you might be
preoccupiedwithallthefreefoodandactivitiesonof-
fertostartacooking/shoppingroutine,sowe’llletyou
off the hook this week! Over the year, expect to see
reader-contributed recipes, Imperialite-tested tips
and hacks, ingredient/place reviews, serious journal-
ism on food-related happenings (say, advancements
in stuff like new GM strains, etc.) and features in the
style of The Food Lab on Serious Eats (amongst other
things).As with all things food,your mileage and pal-
ate may vary, so feel free to take our advice as gospel
truth or with a pinch of salt (pun intended).
If you’ve got any ideas/recipes to share, a lead on a
great little place to review, or just want an excuse to
see me break out some fancy coffee gadgets, drop
food.felix@imperial.ac.uk an email and we’ll take it
from there.

You’ll probably find that in the first
week, most of your meals will come
from all the fresher events you’ll be
attending (hall Chinatown dinners,
pizza nights, etc.), as well as nibbles
from CSP taster sessions. Between all
the long ‘getting to know you’ chats
you’ll be having with the cute dude/
dudette across your hallway and the
parties you’ll have to hit, there’s not
going to be much time to prep for
cooked meals (if I had a pound for
each heart attack my peers had when
they checked their bank balances
post-Freshers’ Week! A fair bit of it
wasn’t spent on alcohol, mind you).
Freshers’ Flu does strike a lot
easier when your immune system
isn’t bolstered enough with proper
nutrition, though. So, to prevent the
Flu putting an early damper on your
Freshers’ Week celebrations, we’ve
got a few quick and dirty suggestions
for getting by.
Eat breakfast and smaller
meals more regularly
It’s the least you can do, even if
it’s light. Even if it’s just a PB and
J sandwich, cereal (bars) or instant
porridge. Sometimes, in all the
excitement, you go for long periods
without eating (and before you know
it, it’s 3pm and you haven’t lunched/
it’s been 8-10 hours since your last
meal) and not eating breakfast
extends this wait period. This wreaks
havoc on your stomach linings and
all that jazz in the long run – no one
wants to have to contend with severe
pains in the middle of exams. Do
yourself a favour; your metabolism
and stomach lining will thank you.
(Healthy) snacking is your
friend
Sort of an elaboration to the tip
above: a bag of apples/easy peelers/
bananas (for the week), or a pot
of make-your-own-granola (see
Michelle’s super easy and yummy
recipe overleaf) – something you can
easily chuck in your bag and bring
out with you should do the trick.
Make an event out of it
Cooking for yourself – by yourself – is
almost always a drag for a fair few. I
find that even when I’m the only one
doing the prep/cooking for a given
meal, I tend to enjoy it more if I’m
going to be sharing the meal with
someone other than myself. If you
find yourself staying in one night
with a few others because you’re tired
or there isn’t anything of interest on,
why not club together and try making
an easy crowd-pleaser recipe with said
friends? Pool together equipment and
money for ingredients - it’s a great
way to break the ice. It’s also a very
good excuse to try out certain cuisines
you’ve never had the chance to
sample: I can remember at least two
examples of friends from other halls
having me “teach” them the art of
Chinese cuisine/stir-fried veggies and
rice. Also, things like roast dinners
may be overkill if you’re going solo,
but make it a group of 4 or even 2 and
it starts to get more practical. Food
really tastes better when it’s shared
– try the easy cheesecake recipe
submitted by Rafael for a start.
Drink up
Yeah, no doubt you’ll be doing just
that most nights with all the balls
going on. But in this instance I’m
referring to water. It’s very easy to
forget, especially when the weather
gets cooler, but being sufficiently
hydrated will go a long way in
keeping your energy levels up (for all
the events) and your health in check.
Bargain hunt (with mates)
You’ll want to do this with your food
shop when you finally have time.
Extreme couponing may only be a
thing in America, and not being part
of the NUS means we don’t get certain
perks...but that Imperial College card
does net you quite a few bargains,
and some of the local businesses near
us only offer Imperial-ID-exclusive
savings. Try going in twos when food
shopping as you’ll be able to make use
of savings on BOGOF (Buy One Get
One Free) or similar offers - without
ending up with too much food. We’re
also suckers for signing up to Amazon
Local and Opentable mailers to
keep an eye out for offers on dining
out – you can get some ridiculously
cheap deals on afternoon teas at posh
London hotels, for instance (perfect
for impressing the folks on a visit!).

Easy Peasy Cheesecake Recipe
Everybody loves a cheesecake. Rafael T. Sánchez has a great recipe.
"Perfect
'procrasti-
baking'
project for
lazy week-
ends; best
done with
that cutie
down the
corridor
from you."
Felix Food says: “We were actually
deliriously happy when we saw Rafa’s
pics of this cake, both in mini and
sharing versions. They look pretty
and yummy enough to be a crowd-
pleaser, yet aren’t so ridiculously
complex that they’ll discourage
first-time student bakers with long
cooking times or tough methods
and of course, the proof is in the
pudding’s taste.
Feel free to experiment with scaling
batch sizes, changing flavorings/
fruits, or using unique cake tins/
molds. Perfect “procrastibaking”
project for lazy weekends; best done
with that cutie down the corridor
from you.”
Ingredients:
• 200g plain digestive biscuits (any
brand, no chocolate/caramel/
anything)
• 225g sugar, plus 40g for base
(approx. 3 tbsp)
• 80g unsalted butter
• 900g Philadelphia Cream Cheese
(or any other plain cream cheese)
• 4 eggs (medium to large)
• 1tbsp lemon juice (substitute
with 1tsp vanilla extract if you
don’t like lemon)
Optional topping:
• 500g strawberries (or other fruits
and berries)
• 25g sugar (around 2 tbsp)
Method:
Base:
Preheat the oven to 160°C. Carefully
place the biscuits inside a ziploc
bag, seal well and crush them with a
rolling pin/kitchen hammer/bottom
of a pan until they are evenly reduced
to fine crumbs.
Melt the butter, add 40 grams of
sugar and thoroughly mix with the
biscuit crumbs. Press mixture onto
the bottom of a cake tin* to form the
biscuit base. Cool in the fridge for 40
minutes.
Mix the cream cheese with 225
grams of sugar and the lemon juice.
Then slowly add in the eggs, one at a
time, until the mixture is even. Pour
it over the cooled crust.
Place in a preheated oven and bake
for 50 minutes, or until the surface is
set and no longer soft.
Once cooled, put in the fridge for 3
to 4 hours. It’s all ready to eat!
Topping:
Save a third of the nicer-looking
strawberries to decorate the top. Hull
(remove the green bit) and chop the
rest of the strawberries, then blend
with 25 grams of sugar and a large
spoonful of water.
Sieve the blend and pour it over
the cheesecake. Slice the remaining
strawberries and decorate the cake!
If you're feeling fancy:
You can make individual cheesecakes!
Just follow the same recipe - but use
little glass ramekins instead of a big
cake tin (you can recycle the ramekins
when you buy puddings like Gü pots
in the supermarket.)
*If you don’t have a cake tin, you
can use two disposable aluminium
baking pans. Split the crumbs and the
mixture in two, putting one half in
each pan – instead of one traditional
cheesecake you’ll get two much
lighter cakes.
Do watch out, they cook much
faster this way!
Homemade snacking granola
MICHELLE TAN
FOOD WRITER
Mich is a sucker for balanced eating on
a budget, scouting for healthy-eating
cafes and wandering around supermarket
aisles/market stalls to relax. This
recipe also leaves plenty of room for
customization - you can add your favorite
fruit/nuts, include dark chocolate pieces,
adjust sugar content to suit your palate,
etc (I for one tend to leave my raisins/
sultanas whole instead of chopped.)
It provides a sustained energy source
that beats the sugar crashes you get from
other snacks - perfect for keeping up
your concentration during long hours in
the lecture hall. And of course, making
a huge batch works out cheaper without
all the nasty extras in most shop-bought
granola.
Makes 2 cups:
• 3 tablespoons packed light
brown sugar
• 3 cups rolled oats (not instant)
• 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
• 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
• 1/3 cup honey
• 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
• 1/2 cup finely diced dried fruit
• 1/2 cup coarsely chopped nuts or
seeds (either raw or toasted)
Heat the oven to 150°C and place
a rack in the centre. Place the oats,
brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt in
a large bowl and stir to combine; set
aside. Combine honey, oil, and vanilla
in a small bowl and stir well. Pour
over the oat mixture and mix until
the oats are thoroughly coated.
Line a baking sheet with parchment
and tip out the granola mixture.
Spread into a donut shape to ensure
that all the oats bake evenly.
Place in centre of oven on prepared
rack and bake for 15 minutes, and
then rotate the tray. Continue baking
until the granola is very light golden
brown (takes anywhere from 5-15
minutes)
Place the baking sheet on a wire
rack and cool the granola to room
temperature. Once thoroughly cool,
break into small pieces. Store in an
airtight container for up to 2 weeks.
Serve with yogurt and fresh fruit for
a scrummy treat at breakfast, or as a
snack in-between meals.
Protip: “I’ve found that buying
oats, nuts and seeds in bulk is the
cheapest option - you can find all the
ingredients at the huge Whole Foods
Market on High Street Kensington.
At times when work gets me down,
I find it therapeutic to just meander
the supermarket aisles, forgetting
about the mountain of work I have
to complete by tomorrow. There’s a
sense of satisfaction to be felt when
I manage to walk out with 5 pounds
worth of nuts, seeds, grains and pulses
ready to make some fine dish for the
night’s dinner - or a fresh batch of
granola for tomorrow’s breakfast.”
Cheaper alternatives: If you’re
concerned about the price, you’ll still
be able to find everything else in your
usual local supermarkets. You won’t
be able to bulk buy like in WFM, but
it’s great for experimenting in smaller
batches.
