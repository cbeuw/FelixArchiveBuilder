Freshers’ Fair is one of the biggest events of the year, and definitely not one to
be missed. The South Kensington Campus is transformed into a showcase of
every Club, Society and Project that we have on offer at Imperial College Union.
It is a fantastic environment to find out exactly what we have going on, as well as
grabbing some freebies and soaking up the atmosphere. Every year thousands of
students attend the fair, visiting many of the 320+ stalls that each Club, Society &
Project get to promote their group, hold demonstrations, give out freebies and chat
to students.
Stalls are roughly grouped by type so you’ll be able to find any groups associated
with a particular interest all in one place, though of course I’d strongly suggest you
don’t just visit the one group you might be interested in. There is a huge range of
activities on offer and University is the best time to try new things and meet new
people. We’re really proud of the diversity and dedication of our student groups and
we’d encourage you to take part in as much as you possibly can.
As well as the stalls there will be demos and performances on throughout the day,
just check out the Queens Lawn, Union Gym, Metric, and the Great Hall to look for
these. There will also be hourly tours of the newly redeveloped Media Basement
meeting in Beit Quad. Another great chance to check out some of our fantastic
student groups performing will be at the Freshers’ Fair afterparty.
Freshers’ Fair operates a strict no trading policy so you won’t need to part with any
money. Instead you’ll be encouraged to sign up to the mailing lists of the groups
you chat to on the day so that they can keep you informed with what’s going on.
Feel free to sign up to as many mailing lists as you’re interested in, it’s really easy to
unsubscribe and it’s definitely better to keep your options as open as possible right
at the beginning.
Give It A Go (GIAG) is a programme we run that lets you try out many of the Clubs,
Societies & Projects and little or no cost before you commit to buying membership.
Keep an eye out for these events on the What’s On calendar online where you’ll be
able to find more details.
Don’t worry if you miss out on going to the first few events or meetings of a club,
you’ll be able to join a group or sign up to a mailing list at any time of the year. You
can get in contact with groups via the contact details on their A to Z profile online.
This can all be done on our website: imperialcollegeunion.org/a-to-z.
I look forward to seeing many of you at the Fair and I hope you enjoy it!
