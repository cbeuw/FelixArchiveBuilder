Union media facilities revamp finally
completed
On Tuesday after a year of
consultation, designing and
construction, Imperial College Union
finally unveiled their new state-of-
the-art Media Centre housed in the
West Basement of Beit Quadrangle.
After College announced plans to
convert the East Basement into new
affordable bedrooms precipitating a
need to new storage facilities for club
equipment, a joint project between
College and the Union was launched
to upgrade the aging facilities of
the media centre and provide much
needed storage.
The old Media Centre was built in
2001 and installed by students, but
with the recent industry wide move to
digital equipment, the aging analogue
equipment was beginning to show
its age. In the past, these facilities
have helped many students take the
first steps in a career in this industry.
To ensure that the Union continues
to offer students state-of-the-art
equipment and applicable techniques
to that in commercial facilities,
the redevelopment has led to a live
television, radio, recording and
rehearsal studios, professional-grade
darkroom, postproduction facilities,
and a new production office for Felix
to be built.
While smaller than the Media
Centre which it replaces, the
new facilities are kitted out to a
much higher specification, with
the College spending close to
£100,000 on equipment, including:
a 32-channel ProTools recording
system; 4K-compatible live television
broadcast equipment handling up to
12 cameras; an acoustically-treated
postproduction studio with a 5.1
reference-grade surround-sound
system; and 4K editing suite. With
shared offices and studios, the
Media Centre is much more flexible,
promoting inter-societies activities.
As part of the project the dedicated
24/7 radio broadcast studio has been
equipped with a Studer digital system
linked into the rest of the broadcast
facilities. The Media societies have
been given a much-needed computer
upgrade, with an all-new set of 27”
iMacs and Creative Cloud.
Just a stone’s throw away from the
Metric and FiveSixEight, this facility
can record and broadcast live plays,
concerts, and shows from either of
these spaces, as well as being able to
edit and produce events recorded
around campus and further afield.
This allows students to put on
productions on a scale unrivalled by
almost any completely student-run
facility in the country.
The Media Centre is not without
controversy, though. Philippa Skett,
Editor-in-Chief of Felix, has allegedly
been involved in a longstanding
dispute with a senior member of the
Union management team regarding
a semicircular desk. When asked for
comment, she did not reply directly
to the allegations; instead responding
with a disgruntled “My office is
smaller than it used to be, but at least
we have natural light I guess.”
The Media Centre is open for any
students or members of the Union
to use with the individual rooms
managed by student societies. The
Media groups that make use of the
basement are IC Radio – who operate
the 24/7 internet radio station; ICTV
– who produce television and short
films; Jazz and Rock Society – who
manage the rehearsal studio with a
drum kit, keyboards, and guitar and
bass amplifiers; and PhotoSoc – who
loan out photographic equipment
and provide darkroom facilities for
developing film.
Also located in the West Basement
are LeoSoc, who have an arts studio
and run regular classes, and the
Science Fiction Society who curate the
second largest science fiction library
in the World (after MIT).Tours of
the new basement will be ran during
Freshers’ fair.

NEWS WRITERS
Viewers of Downton Abbey were
treated to a fire at the stately home
in the first episode of the new series
shown on Sunday 21 September. As
part of the rescue operation, Jezebel,
the Royal College of Science Union’s
fire engine mascot, made a surprise
appearance on screen as the fire
brigade start leaving for home!
Last year’s RCS Motor Club
Captain, Stephen Ball, as well as
Motor Club/Imperial College
alumnus John James also appeared
as extras alongside the fire engine.
Jezebel was ‘head hunted’ by a
company specialising in finding
vehicles for films and broadcast,
after they had seen her on the annual
London to Brighton Run.
Downton Abbey is set in Yorkshire
(but filmed in Berkshire), hence the
‘London Fire Brigade’ gilding on the
side of the vehicle would be somewhat
out of place. Thanks to the work of
experts employed by the filming
company, vinyl stickers covering the
gilding transformed Jezebel into a
fire engine owned by the ‘Downton
Fire Brigade’ for the duration of
the filming without damaging the
paintwork underneath.
The five minutes of film took two
evenings to record on set at Highclere
Castle, although the fire scenes
themselves were recorded in a studio
to avoid damage to the Grade I listed
property.
Stephen described some of his
experiences from being in the
programme to Felix: “I had tea made
for me by Kevin Doyle (Mr Molesley),
and chatted with Thomas and James
(Rob James-Collier and Ed Speleers)
in the house's library during one of
breaks.”
He continued, “the two boys who
play George Crawley loved sitting in
Jezebel's cab.” Asked whether he could
foresee a future in being an extra, he
replied “the food was good, but I don't
think I could be an extra full time.”
This isn’t Jezebel’s first television
appearance. In 1982, Jez appeared
on the BBC’s Blue Peter before
travelling off to Germany for a
carnival. In 1966, The Jokers, a film
by Michael Winner, also stared the
famous vehicle. A video of the film
appearance is available on YouTube.
Stephen also noted that RCS Motor
Club would “love to get her back
on the screen,” and that “there has
already been discussion […] about
getting Clementine [the RSM's truck
mascot] into a series sometime soon.”
The entire first episode of the
new series of Downton Abbey can
be watched on ITV Player online
until around the end of October.
RCS Motor Club will be giving rides
at Fresher's Fair and doing tours of
London in the first weeks of term
should anyone wish to meet the
famous star.
