Last Sunday, a man allegedly
recognised as someone wanted by
Devonshire and Cornwall police was
reported to have been drinking in
Beit Quad. The man, who produced
a set of keys for Beit Hall upon
requesting a drink at the bar, was
spotted by another guest who thought
he looked strikingly similar to a
known con man, who has been on the
run since 2010.
Upon recognising the man, the
guest called the police who arrived
on the scene, and then proceeded to
interview the bar staff. The man had,
in the meantime, left the premises.
His whereabouts are now unknown
[at time of print], although the police
said the con man that the man is
suspected to be was “Not dangerous.”
The guest was attending a private
event at the time held in the Union
Bar, and reportedly identified the con
man due to the similarities they had
in appearance, including a full sleeve
of tattoos of similar patterning.
The con man in question has been
known to use several aliases, so it is
uncertain from the Beit residential
records if he is the man who is wanted
by police.
Plabon Saha, who was working at
the bar at the time, was interviewed
by the police, although it is uncertain
who served the man and if he was
indeed the criminal wanted by
Devonshire and Cornwall police.
Mr Saha was advised to call 999
should the man return. Bar managers
were unavailable for comment.
Imperial’s first President (and
sixteeth head), Professor Alice Gast,
was instated on the first of September,
following the retirement of Sir Keith
O’Nions. Professor Gast will lead the
College’s strategy to develop Imperial
West, alongside strengthening the
College’s links to the government,
industry, philanthropists and alumni.
Professor Gast comes from Lehigh
University, USA, where she president.
She also was a former Vice President
for Research and an Associate Provost
at MIT.
Whilst at Lehigh, Professor Gast
oversaw a 47% increase in the size
of the Lehigh estate, making her a
perfect candidate to help with the
expansion of Imperial College and its
satellite campuses. She also concluded
a $500 million fundraising campaign,
and raised an additional $255 million
during her time at MIT.
Her appointment marks the
completion of restructure to the
senior roles that oversee the College.
Whereas the Rector’s remit was to
oversee academic and administrative
affairs, and chair the Management
Board and Senate, as President,
Professor Gast will work alongside
Professor James Stirling, the recently
appointed Provost, and will focus
more on Imperial’s external affairs.
The Provost reports directly to the
President.
Felix’s interview with Professor
Gast will be printed in next week’s
issue.

Imperial bounces up
and down in worldwide
rankings
Imperial has increased its standing
in the Times Higher Education
(THE) World Rankings 2015, rising
from 10th to 9th worldwide, and
only second to Oxbridge and US
universities. The news comes in the
wake of the QS World University
Ratings, in which Imperial was
ranked second equal with Cambridge,
with a total score of 87.5.
The THE Survey operates on 13
performance indicators, grouped into
five areas; and research, teaching and
citations comprise 90% of the overall
ranking.
Surprisingly, given its reputation
among undergraduates, Imperial
came out strongly in teaching, with
a score of 84.5, also scoring highly in
research (88.3), international outlook
(92.7) and citations (89.4). The scores
are measures of probability – so a
score of 87.5 in a single category
means that the data point of a
randomly chosen institution will fall
below Imperial’s 87.5% of the time.
More worryingly, the majority of
UK universities have slipped down
the league tables, including Oxford
and other London universities.
Both Phil Baty and John O’Leary,
respective editors of the THE and
QS rankings, blame inadequate
UK public funding, and warn that
the UK’s leading position might
slip as universities in Asia and the
developing world climb steadily
up the rankings. Still, Reading
University Vice-Chancellor Sir David
Bell seemed not to be worried.
"One cannot read too much into a
single year's rankings. Global league
tables are highly volatile indicators.
The fact that some UK universities
have risen and fallen up to almost 40
places year-on-year shows it is much
more important to look at longer-
term trends over time."
This is borne out by THE Rankings
from previous years, in which
Imperial has been consistently
ranked between 8th and 10th –
indeed, Imperial’s scores have barely
shifted from last year. The drop from
8th appears to correlate with a fall in
industry income in 2013-14.
To break down results by
department, medics can feel a certain
satisfaction in being 4th worldwide
for Clinical, Pre-Clinical and Health,
with Engineering and Technology
coming in at 6th. Life Sciences and
Physical Sciences placed at 10th and
12th respectively.

Science Fiction library
damaged by flooding
Last Friday, a leak in a Beit Hall
water pipe caused water damage to the
Imperial College Science Fiction and
Fantasy library in the Union West
Basement. Dripping noises could
first be heard from the ceiling in the
early afternoon, and over the course
of two hours, several ceiling tiles were
soaked through and fell onto the floor
below as society members, union
employees, and innocent bystanders
attempted to rescue hundreds of
books stored in shelves underneath
the affected area. Union employees
seemed apologetic and understanding
of the need to get the problem fixed.
Some book stock was water damaged.
There is so far no evidence of more
extensive damage to the room beyond
the ceiling tiles and the now-soaked
carpet (which was due to be replaced
this summer), or damage in any other
West Basement rooms.
A similar, but smaller, leak had
occurred the day before, originating
from the same Beit Hall room.
This leak was quickly fixed and the
damaged ceiling tiles replaced by
early Friday morning. Water damage
in the library has occurred in the
past, and while the Union had fixed
up the damaged ceiling over the
summer as part of the West Basement
refurbishments, the leaking problem
seems to not yet have been fully
resolved. Talks regarding more
permanent solutions are in progress.
ICSF hopes to regain use of the space
in time for Fresher’s Fair.
