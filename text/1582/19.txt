Games To Look Forward To
Max Eggl has looked at upcoming releases so you don’t have to
"Yes you
read that
correctly,
we are go-

games
released on
the same
day."
"Call of

franchise
that is ridi-
culed for
its seeming
simplic-
ity, lack of
originality
and imma-

its audi-

World of Warcraft:
Warlords of Draenor
Release Date: 13.11.14
Platform: PC and Mac
In recent times the king of MMOs
has been losing strength. After a
drop to 7 million subscribers as of
August from an all-time high of
12 million a few years back, lots
of talk is abound that the end of
the world (of warcraft) is nigh. To
stem the flow Activision have now
announced an ambitious update that
will be available in about a month.
Following on from the story of the
Mists of Pandaria, we have a story
that includes time-travel, returning
of legendary Warcraft characters
and generally a lot of promise.
Furthermore, there will be ,among
many others, implementations of
Player-built garrisons, changed PvP
and the almost mandatory raise in
the max level. All in all it looks quite
promising, and if you have been
contemplating returning to WoW,
now may be the time. Just be careful
that you remember to have a life
outside Azeroth.
Call of Duty: Advanced
Warfare
Release Date: 4.11.14
Platform: PC, XOne, PS4, Xbox 360,
PS3
Call of Duty is a franchise that is
ridiculed for its seeming simplicity,
lack of originality and immaturity of
its audience. Quick summary: it is a
simplistic shooter, where you have no
real strategy or team play (am I being
slightly biased?). Yet, on an annual
basis millions go out, queue for hours
and spend hard-earned cash on the
newest instalment. Now on the 4th
of November this event is rolling
around for another year. This time
however, we will see some changes
that might make this game worth a
go. A redesigned HUD and supposed
change to the gun mechanics, as
well as genuine plot setting seem to
suggest that Activision are realising
they can’t keep pushing the same
thing (albeit adding dogs) onto us and
expect us to buy it.
Pokémon Omega Ruby and
Alpha Sapphire
Release Date: 28.11.14
Platform: 3DS
After the recent relative success
of Pokémon X and Y, the gamer
community was quite surprised that
we would get another Pokémon game
in the same year! Not only that, but
these two games are remakes of Ruby
and Sapphire, a set of games that
fans have been waiting for for This
is a game that Pokémon fans have
been waiting for roughly three years
now. In fact there was even a meme:
“Hoenn confirmed”. Marrying the
story and characters of the original
with the mechanics, like the 3-D
view for example, that made X and Y
should make for a very good game.
In fact this Editor, who has so far
resisted the need to buy a 3DS might
buy himself one, along with a copy of
Alpha Sapphire for nostalgia’s sake!
Far Cry 4
Release Date: 18.11.14
Platform: PC, XOne, PS4, Xbox 360,
PS3
After the commercial and critical
success that was Far Cry 3, which had
a great set of characters, game play
and a beautiful open world, Ubisoft
is now releasing the next instalment
in the Far Cry series. This FPS, which
usually is marked by beautiful maps,
great game play and interesting
stories is set in the Himalayas,
promises to deliver the things we
have come to expect from this series.
These include a gorgeous open
world, a large dynamic way of doing
your missions and great characters.
Generally these games always deliver,
so I think this game should be a safe
bet if you are looking for a geeat
gaming experience.
Lord of the Rings: Shadow of
Mordor
Release Date: 30.9.14(PC), 10.3.14
(XOne, PS4), 21.11.14 (Xbox 360, PS3)
Platform: PC, XOne, PS4, Xbox 360,
PS3
A game, that I am personally
extremely excited for, the shadow
of Mordor is the newest Lord of the
Rings game to be released. A action-
RPG looking like a combination
of Skyrim and Assassin’s creed, we
once again enter the world of Middle
Earth, but this time not with any
of the established characters from
Tolkien’s imagination, but indeed
a entirely new protagonist, Talion,
and a new story. Utilizing all of the
rich lore that makes LotR, including
stealth, magic and action and
introducing entirely new mechanics,
this game could be an absolute
winner. If you are any kind of LoTR
fan, you should seriously consider
buying this game.
Assassins Creed Unity &
Rogue
Release Date: 13.11.14
Platform: PC, XOne, PS4 (Unity),
Xbox 360, PS3 (Rogue)
Yes you read correctly, we are going
to have two Assassin’s Creed games
released on the same day. One allows
you to play as a Templar, hunting
Assassin, focusing heavily on naval
warfare and serves to fill the gaps in
the story between Assassin’s Creed 3
and Black Flag. Unity, on the other
hand, features a completely new
assassins and is set in Paris on the
eve of the French revolution. Both
of these titles look amazing, and
the updates to the game-play and
multiplayer add on an already great
set of games. The only problem is that
Unity is only available for the new
generation of consoles as well as PC,
while Rogue only is available for the
PS3 and Xbox 360. This means that
unless you own both generations, you
will only be able to play one.
Alien: Isolation
Release Date: 7.10.2014
Platform: PC, XOne, PS4, Xbox 360,
PS3
The soonest game on our list,
Alien: Isolation plans to restore the
franchise to its high pedestal after
the abysmal game that was Colonial
marines. Instead of going for the
FPS, the newest Alien game is now a
horror-survival game which follows a
recent trend of these games. However,
unlike these other games, this game
has a rich backstory to draw upon,
which it does masterfully. You are
the lonely Amanda Ripley, who is
investigating the disappearance of her
mother. Throughout your quest for
knowledge, you are being stalked by
a single incredibly scary xenomorph
against which you have limited
ability to fight. This game looks super
good and scary, (just watch youtube
videos with people wearing the oculus
rift) and if you are fan of the stealth-
horror-survival genre, genuinely a
title to look at.
Sid Meier's Civilization:
Beyond Earth
Release Date: 24.10.2014
Platform: PC, Mac and Linux
The Civ series is undoubtably
the king of strategy games. Using
the tried and tested method of
most 4X (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit,
eXterminate) titles these games
just have a special place in strategy
enthusiasts hearts. Now with the
newest Civ game: Beyond Earth, we
have something that is completely
different from any previous Civ
Games. Still retaining the basic game
mechanics, we are now trying to take
of the universe instead of only earth.
Furthermore, instead of relying on
historic civilizations, we now have the
ability to create our own civilizations
of the future. Even though the price
may seem somewhat steep, (you can
always wait for a steam sale!) it is
something to get excited for.
