Society to host
International
Trauma
This November,ICSM Surgical
Society will be hosting the
9th International Trauma
Conference.Last year,over
200 students from the UK and
Europe attended,as well as
doctors,surgeons and nurses.
The weekend-long
conference aims to teach
trauma management through
a series of lectures and
workshops.This year’s event
has a great new programme,
and includes topics like
trauma in zones of conflict.
Amongst the exciting plans
is a keynote lecture from
Jonathan Kaplan–a South
African trained surgeon,
who is also an author and
investigative reporter.He has
lots of experience of surgery
in war zones across the world,
some of which are shared
in his thrilling book“The
DressingStation:ASurgeon’s
ChronicleofWarandMedicine”.
Another notable speaker is
Imperial’s own Dr Zul Mirza
–a consultant in emergency
medicine who will be offering
his insights on chest trauma.
He has given multiple lectures
in the past,both nationally
and internationally and has
appeared many times on the
news.
Trauma prides itself on the
interactive workshops it offers,
which include FAST scanning,
intubation,surgical airways
and chest drains.They offer a
unique learning opportunity,
which isn’t to be missed out on.
In keeping with tradition,
the conference will conclude
with an inspirational speech
from our patron Professor
Kenneth Boffard,who heads
the Department of Surgery
at Johannesburg Hospital in
South Africa.
There are plenty of new
ideas being brought to Trauma
this year,with improvements
to many of the practical
stations and new speakers.
So even if you’ve attended
previously,you’re sure to
find a new experience at
this year’s conference.As an
added bonus,you can enjoy
the weekend for a discounted
price if you get surgical society
membership.
All in all,Trauma’14 is setting
up to be a fantastic weekend,
and I hope to see you there!

Raincatcher Imperial is a student-
led charity with a rich history of
both infrastructure and community
development projects since our
formation in 2008. We work with
Raincatcher, a registered charity
under the UK Charity Commission
and local non-governmental
organisations (NGOs) such as Caritas
in Tabora, Tanzania. Since 2009, we
have visited various communities in
arid regions of Tanzania, with an aim
to improve access to and education of
clean water, sanitation and hygiene.
We welcome all students from any
academic background, and as we are
gathering more freshers this year, it is
our goal to tell you more about what
we do and how we aim to achieve
those end results.
A team of 4 of our members this
summer spent a long 9 weeks in
Tabora, Tanzania to work hand in
hand with the local communities
to achieve the aims we had set as
an organisation. With only an
intensive trip preparation course
prepared by our charity trustees
and some guidance from past teams,
the team bravely journeyed into an
environment expecting language
difficulties, culture shocks and even
the occasional diarrhoea.
Yet, with all odds against them, they
have once again done our charity
proud by not only completing a
50,000L over ground ferro-cement
tank in the vicinities of a Primary
school in Tabora, but also engaged
the members of the community by
empowering locals to pass on their
water jar construction knowledge and
enforce basic sanitary habits within
their families.
Tanzania is a country poor in
economy but rich in community
spirit. Friendly conversations would
simply flow between people who do
not know one another and it gave me
a much differed experience to living
back in my hometown.
Our trip took place in the 6 month
long dry season period in Tanzania,
and there I really experienced the
value of clean, potable water. Every
day, children at the primary school
would make multiple trips to fetch
surface pond water from a location 15
minutes walk away. Even when they
knew the water was so bad and turbid,
they still consumed such dirty water. I
myself however was fortunate enough
to purchase drinking water and to
have taken vaccines, thereby avoiding
many diseases commonly found in
that region such as Typhoid, Hepatitis
A and Malaria. But do the locals? Join
us in our work, and actively strive to
give a better life to Tanzanians. We
aim not to make a large difference
by ourselves, but to inspire many to
join the work we do and maybe one
day, to see our combined efforts sum
up to something appreciable on the
national scale.
We, also had the chance to take
a break after our charity work and
enjoy the picturesque landscape
of what Tanzania has to offer. The
never-ending blue skies and rushing
tides along the shoreline in Zanzibar
beach are a far cry from the gloomy
London weather in winter, often
accompanied by the cacophony
from heavy traffic. Taking in such
well-appreciated tranquillity while
enjoying the sunset on the horizon, it
can just take your breath away.
Raincatcher Imperial has
accomplished much since its
establishment, and our programmes
have placed us at a good position to
fulfill our long term goals. However
we need more enthusiastic and
keen individuals who dare to dream
a better future for all, to venture
beyond their boundaries of first
world comfort and to touch the hearts
and lives of those in need. Join us and
be a part of our team.
As many of you are aware, the crisis
in Gaza has had a detrimental
impact not only on the country’s
infrastructure but also on its
residents, including the children of
Gaza.
This is an ongoing issue and
has been at the forefront of Save
the Children’s concerns. Over the
summer, the Imperial College Save
the Children society was involved in
a tube collection at South Kensington
station for the DEC Gaza Crisis
Appeal. We contributed in raising
money along with plenty of other
volunteers across London, who
participated in various other forms
of collections, managing to raise a
combined total of £33,539.67.
Imperial College Save the Children
is a fun charity society that aims to
raise money and works in over 120
countries worldwide.
The charity helps over 30
million children per year and
organises events such as live music
concerts, parties around London
and nationwide, talks and shows
to promote global health issues
such as child poverty, Third World
education, and health care in
developing countries.
This year we have an extremely
enthusiastic and energetic committee
who have a passion to help those less
fortunate than ourselves.
We've had many fun and
memorable events over the past
year such as tube collections, a fancy
dress “Fun Run” through Hyde Park,
doughnut sales and even collections
at an Arsenal Football match!
We plan on continuing these events
this year along with many more,
including a collection at Cadogan
Hall – a leading venue in Chelsea,
which has hosted performances by
some of UK’s top orchestras as well
as their own orchestra (The Royal
Philharmonic Orchestra). Our headline
event, Imperial's Got Talent – has
seen the participation of many
societies such as the Imperial College
Belly Dancing society and the well
renowned Imperial Techtonics A
Cappella group.
This year we are planning to
collaborate with multiple other
universities to bring you our biggest
inter-university talent competition
yet.
We're looking forward to seeing you
all at Fresher's Fair, do come and find
us and say hi!
