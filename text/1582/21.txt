Bestival 2014: Desert Island Disco
William Stocker reviews this summer festival favourite
"Bestival
was the
perfect
close to
a great
musical
summer."

simply
a giant

Bestival is full of wonders and delights
that many try to copy but most fail
to emulate. Curated by DJ Rob da
Bank, and set in the hills of the Isle of
Wight, it is simply a giant playground
for overgrown kids, with a balloon-
stuffed tent for playing in, a giant
Wishing Tree for climbing, and an
inflatable church to get married in. It
simply has to be seen to be believed
and even in my fourth year of going,
the numerous wonders dotted around
Robin Hill Country Park never fail to
delight.
The theme for this years fest
was Desert Island Disco and the
partygoers didn’t disappoint with
disco balls, leggings and neon in
abundance.
Music started on the Thursday
evening with weary festival goers
having made the trip from the
mainland across the Solent on a fleet
of ferries to the island, rejuvenated by
the buzz and excitement of the few
days ahead.
The highlight of the first night was
surely Jackmaster & Oneman on the
unbelievable Red Bull stage new to
the festival for this year kicking the
weekend off in style.
On Friday the ever popular
Disclosure whose achievements seem
to be going from strength to strength
were joined on stage by surprise acts
Eliza Doolittle and Sam Smith
wowed the crowd with their energetic
set and massive anthems including
‘White Noise’ and ‘You and Me’.
Outkast were the most questionable
headliner of the weekend with the
whole crowd waiting for the hits and
seemingly humming and swaying
along, whilst waiting for without
doubt their one banger ‘Hey-Ya’ that
brought hysteria amongst remaining
crowd and didn’t disappoint.
Saturday’s disco theme was truly
embraced by Sophie Ellis-Bexter
who entertained the main stage crowd
in the daytime sun. The set started
off quite slow with SEB pushing her
new album Wanderlust but she didn’t
disappoint later on and after her
swift wardrobe change into a hula
skirt and gold swim suit number out
came the classics, with ‘Murder on
the Dancefloor’ receiving one of the
largest cheers of the weekend.
Sunday at Bestival was brought to a
close by Chic featuring an emotional
Nile Rodgers, and their utterly
magnificent Desert Island Disco
finale set. Emotional and predictably
next level, it was brimming with a
pantheon of the greatest hits that
have benefitted from Nile’s golden
touch, brought to a close under the
worlds largest disco ball (10.33m
in diameter) and a beautiful set of
fireworks.
A personal highlight of mine was
the surprise gig by a small band

For when the thought of another
evening negotiating the sticky
corridors of Piccadilly Institute is
enough to turn your stomach. The
prices below rely on you flashing that
Imperial student card. Flash away.
Wednesday/Fridays/Saturdays @
Notting Hill Arts Club – This trendy
West London spot is so close to
South Kensington, it’d be rude not to.
Tucked under a Mexican restaurant
on the high street, the line that
marks its entrance is usually just
for show and moves pretty quickly.
This place has a cosy, house-party
vibe but a London superclub it ain’t.
previously unknown to me, AW
n-Bomb. Lead by a mesmerizing
female vocalist who wowed a tiny
crowd in and around The Port on the
Saturday night – this unknown act
that I stumbled upon caused utter
euphoria amongst a small group
of festival-goers and is again one
of the great wonders which will no
doubt force me back to the island for
another year of Bestival fun.
For me Bestival was the perfect
close to a great musical summer and
I cannot wait for the 12th instalment
next year.
Wednesdays attract an arty student
crowd, and there are often live acts,
so it’s worth checking the website
beforehand (Notting Hill Gate £8).
Itchy Feet @ Concrete/Proud –
This long established night graces
university towns up and down the
country and is famed for its no frills
approach. If the prospect of endless
David Guetta doesn’t get your engine
going, the Itchy Feet DJs promise
ska, swing and rock n roll all night.
Go to the weekly night in Camden
or the monthly big daddy event in
Shoreditch (Concrete – Shoreditch
High Street £7 adv/ Proud Camden
Town £6 adv).
Whirl-y-gig @ Crucifix Lane – Not
for the faint-hearted, this monthly
night has been going for years and
always has an army of loyal ravers
in attendance. For this reason, it’s
worth booking online to avoid the
mammoth queue that starts forming
at ten o’clock. But it’s worth it. Expect
hours of sweaty dancing to friendly
D&B and psychedelic trance, 2am
epiphanies and friends for life. We
appreciate this sounds awful but,
bathed in that much trippy lighting,it
all kind of makes sense (London Bridge
£12 otd / £16 adv).
Club NME @ KOKO – Often a
chance to catch the latest NME
darlings before they make it big
(Kaiser Chiefs, of all people, opened
it back in 2004).
This student-filled affair is often
messy and always packed. When
the band finishes sing-a-long indie
plays and hipsters go on the pull
(Mornington Crescent £4).
Regression Sessions – If you find
yourself mourning the lack of bouncy
castles and face paint down at Boujis,
this party might be right up your
street. Usually at Electrowerkz in
Islington, with its kitsch decor and
hollowed out tube train bar, these
folks pride themselves on their
combination of good music and
student-friendly novelties to ease
the socialising. A fun night serving
a younger crowd, regression sessions
never disappoints (Angel £5 early
release).
