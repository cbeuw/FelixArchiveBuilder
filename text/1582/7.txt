A triumph for the Union… but the real work starts now
KUNAL WAGLE
COMMENT WRITER
On the 18th September (for those of
you who couldn’t spend enough time
away from the beach to take a look at
the news) Scotland voted to remain
part of the United Kingdom.
For a lot of people this meant that the
debate was over: the margin was large
(about 400,000 votes), both sides have
accepted the verdict, and one of the
major advocates of independence (First
Minister Alex Salmond) has resigned.
Surely that means this is the last we’ll
hear of this after three long years of
arguing over “the issues”.
The short answer? No.
What we’ve seen over the last few
years is merely a warm up to the
main event. Over the coming year
we could, in fact, be seeing one of the
most dramatic changes to the British
political landscape in our lives. David
Cameron doesn’t seem to be going
back on his promise for extra powers
to Scotland, but he’s now introduced
something else to the equation: The
possibility of an English Parliament.
Since then, Number 10 has stressed
that one is not conditional on the
other, but Cameron has already
provided a major insight into the
way he is thinking on this issue. And
the referendum has only served to
augment concerns about a certain
anomaly in the way that Parliament
works. Due to the devolved Scottish
parliament English MPs can’t vote on
Scottish matters, such as education and
health. This makes sense – why should
an MP from the south of Cornwall be
allowed to vote on the education of a
teenager from the Shetland Islands?
However, the sense ends when
we consider what happens with the
equivalent English issues. Today 59
MPs from Scotland can vote on issues,
such as education and health, which
only affect England. A good example
would be the tuition fees hike, which
did not affect Scottish students
studying in Scotland. And yet MPs
from Scotland were allowed to decide
how much tuition fees would cost for
an English student in England? It
doesn’t sound right.
So, from that point of view, an
English Parliament to mirror those
of Scotland, Wales, and Northern
Ireland is a logical next step. One
would presume (the details are still to
be discussed) that any extra powers
that go to Scotland, in the interests of
fairness to all, will also go to devolved
Parliaments in England, Wales, and
Northern Ireland. Of course, with
everything up in the air, that remains
to be seen, but Cameron, Nick Clegg
and Ed Miliband will have a lot to
answer for from the people of these
three nations if they suddenly see more
powers go solely to Scotland.
The theory is that this won’t be
much of an “issue” when it comes to
the general election. This is because
it would appear that there is an
agreement that the Scotland Bill to be
announced next year will be decided
and agreed upon before the election –
and by all three parties.
But that adds an extra complication –
time. There is now a clear deadline for
the new Scotland Bill – the timetable
that is set to be laid out says that there
should be draft legislation ready for
the Scotland Bill during November.
It’s a dilemma for David Cameron.
Ed Miliband, seemed to suggest at the
first day of the party conference that
he doesn’t think there is much need to
make the changes to the English side of
Parliament. Cameron has two options
now. He could push for an English
Parliament now and push it through
in this bill itself. Or he could take
the view that he will not be making
much ground in Scotland anyway next
year, and use the idea of an English
Parliament as a policy in the election.
If he goes for the Parliament before
the election, it would take a lot of
work, and we’d be seeing Downing
Street move incredibly fast to make it
happen.
This is going to be an exciting year
for the onlookers. But don’t be fooled
by the result. The debate on what
happens with Scotland has just begun.
Why our league table success masks
the real problem

Imperial’s surprise jump to joint
second in the QS World Rankings was
a welcome prelude to the academic
year. Students and staff alike were
energised by the international accolade
- Facebook feeds were full of links to
stories about how London had the
most top universities of any city, and
Imperial was the crown jewel. I was
made the poster student of Imperial;
interviewed by The Independent and
BBC London News as a ‘case study’ of
a student at Imperial. A fun and good
experience for me, but I couldn’t help
but get the feeling that the media, and
College were caught up in the hype.
The QS ranking takes in to account
various factors, most of which are
based around research and academia:
40% of the weighting is based
on academics’ rankings of other
universities. Another 20% comes
based on the number of citations our
academics receive (no doubt helped
by Prof Sir John Pendry’s work, as
The Guardian reported). QS awards
20% of its weightings to the academic
student ratio, on the basis that it is
a ‘commitment to teaching’. This is
flawed- surely different universities
will demand different amounts of
teaching from their staff (for one, we
all know Imperial’s academics won’t
be promoted if they aren’t acing their
research, regardless of their teaching).
QS can’t take in to account student
satisfaction, because there is no
global metric or survey which has
been created. So whilst QS’ coverage
of metrics on academic work is
sound, the same cannot be said for
gauging student satisfaction. The
THE Student Experience league table
ranked Imperial 43rd. It cannot just
be because we work hard here: Oxford
and Cambridge placed fifth and sixth,
respectively.
Fundamentally, an improved
student experience has not caused
our rankings to improve. Imperial
has hired some cracking academics
who have pulled up our reputation,
as well citations. If I wanted to keep
Imperial top of the league tables, I
would continue to push its academic
boundaries and recruit more overseas
research focused staff (another
measure QS takes in to account). But
these measures are not in the best
interests of its student population.
Whilst student satisfaction has
increased over the last few years, we
cannot lose sight of the end goal: there
is a long way to go before Imperial sits
with where it rightly should.
Imperial celebrated raising
over £50m last year in donations.
Compared to Oxbridge who have
celebrated raising over one billion
pounds in recent years, we do seem
to be trailing behind. Ask most
students on campus what they think
of Imperial, and you will receive an
apathetic response. They are here
now, want to graduate and get a job.
They perceive it as a transaction
relationship. Currently Imperial has
not built an experience which makes
alumni amenable to donations.
An improvement to the student
experience and teaching will be key to
fostering better relations with future
alumni.
The QS results are undoubtedly a
source of pride for Imperial, but the
real pride for students should come
when we top Student Experience
league tables.

You’re probably a libertarian… you just don’t know it
With placards aloft, a dog-eared
Orwell in their back pockets, and
indignant slogans on their lips, the
hemp-clad students of the latter half
of the 20th century have forged an
iconic image of youth protest. But the
NUS nostalgia squad aside, does this
still hold true today?
Young Britons today are less likely
to join a political party or Trade
Union, less religious than ever before,
less likely to hold high opinion
of British Defence (BSA) and are
less supportive of the welfare state
(see chart). They are more liberal
on views of gender, sexuality, and
race, and also value sustainability
more than ever. Young people today
are environmentally conscious,
concerned about the deficit and
accept capitalism as the norm, having
grown up in a post-Soviet, post-
Thatcher world. Above all they are
less collective and value their own
rights. So, whether they know it or
not, many young Britons are indeed
Libertarians.
Of course, the term Libertarian
conjures up images of Sarah Palin and
Rick Perry in cowboy hats, hunting
deer with automatic rifles atop a
pipeline in Tar Sands. However, the
Tea Party image has hijacked the
Term, which simply implies social
tolerance, enterprising capitalist
spirit, and an emphasis on the
individual.
Let’s be clear, we are not comparing
our views to our parents and
grandparents as they are now. (I’m
sure many of you have elderly
relatives who are far from politically
correct and may say the occasional
comment to your foreign girlfriend
that makes you choke on your roast
potatoes at Sunday lunch.)
“If you’re not a liberal at twenty
you have no heart, if you’re not a
conservative at forty, you have no
brain.”
These words of Winston Churchill
seem to encapsulate a long-held truth
that we all move to the right as we
age. Whilst the current standards of
liberal and conservative have departed
from those that Churchill referred to,
the basic idea that each generation
undergoes a political evolution
through life holds. By comparing the
attitudes of generations during their
respective young lives, a remarkable
shift in the values of our generation is
evident.
The year 2008 was the first time
since records began in which more
young people favoured a tax cut over
increased welfare spending (Ipsos
Mori). Furthermore, less than a third
of ‘Generation Y’ would class the
creation of the welfare state amongst
the country’s greatest achievements,
whereas in our grandparents’
generation, 71% did.
Our social attitudes are changing
even more drastically (for the better,
if I may add) with just under 10%
of today’s youth agreeing with the
statement “homosexuality is wrong”;
compared to 53% of post-war 18-25
year olds.
The picture is clear: fewer
responsibilities for the state and more
rights for the individual.
In turn, this may even explain why
young people are more apathetic
towards politics. For example, a
student today who is, say, unsure
about the power of Brussels, sceptical
of high government spending,
supportive of the legalisation of
drugs and is frustrated by the
inaction on environmental issues is
unrepresented by any major UK party.
This student could not vote
Conservative on social grounds,
nor Labour or Green on economic
grounds. And no right-minded
student would vote for Judas Clegg’s
Lib Dems or the regressive UKIPs.
Some people, like Russell Brand,
put this political apathy down to the
rise of the reformist left exemplified
by the Occupy Movement. This may
be true in part, but whilst the 2000
protesters may have left a mark on
our minds with their prime location,
anonymous masks and catchy slogans,
barring some impending revolution
one cannot seriously suggest that this
movement has claimed the future of
our political generation.
But one man seems to have taken
advantage of the rotation of the youth
towards the libertarian. Boris Johnson
is unquestionably in the 1%. In fact,
he is probably in the 0.001%, but by
positioning himself in the socially
progressive wing of the conservative
party, whilst remaining strongly pro-
enterprise and committed to social
mobility and meritocracy, he appeals
to young voters.
David Cameron calls Boris his
“star player” and perhaps his recently
scheduled return to Westminster is
a sign that the mainstream parties
have finally heeded the “slide to the
(economic) right” and “step to the
(social) left” in the “cha-cha slide” of
Britain’s Generation Y.
"If you're
not a Tory
at forty,
you have
no brain."
"This
may even
explain
why young
people
are more
apathetic
towards
politics."
"Whether they
know it or not,
many young
Britons are indeed
Libertarians. "

COMMENT WRITER
Why having an opinion in Felix is important
This is the Comment Section. As
the name suggests, it has many
comments, opinions, lies, rants and
tangents provided by your fellow
Imperial students. You may find
a serious discussion piece on the
Scottish referendum, or you may find
one of my rants about the queuing
system for the Queen’s Tower Rooms’
canteen. Either way, as the premier
forum to get your comment hosted
online, printed 4000 times, and quite
literally scattered around campus,
the comment section is the third best
bit of Felix (after Hangman and the
crossword).
But it is the most important section.
Felix is not controlled by the Union
or the College. The Rector cannot tell
us what to print and nor can Tom
“His Presidentness” Wheeler. It is
independent, and allows the students
to voice views that either wouldn’t be
noticed or would be ignored. We’re
fortunate enough to be such a diverse
university that the breadth of views
is perfect for kick-starting a good
debate. Anyone is free to submit
an article, and the vast majority
get published. What’s written here
doesn’t represent the opinion of the
Editor, the Union or the College,
purely the author. There aren’t many
places that write its readers such a
blank cheque, but Felix does, and it
does so with pride.
All too often writing gets associated
with the humanities, and yawn, who
wants to be associated with them?
No! It is so much more than an essay
on the inane, or a dissertation on
the boring. Nor is this about 140
character tweets, or click-bait on
BuzzFeed. We like to think students
and staff read this for quality, not just
to see what “the most amazing thing
that happened to me today” is.
Writing and reading in Felix
Comment is about ideas, discussion,
rants, comedy, and sheer
bloodymindedness. Imperial! We
want your views, we demand to share
your mind’s thoughts, and to gift to
us what perspectives and experiences
you can. So open your laptop, start a
new document, and teach us all what
to think.
