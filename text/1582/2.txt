I am writing this editorial like all
previous Felix Editors have done:
sleep deprived; buzzing on coffee;
and one hour to go to deadline.
Welcome to this year’s first issue of
Felix.
We’ve undergone a rebranding,
we are still working on the new
website that should be hitting your
screens in the next week, and we are
looking forward to moving into the
new office. It may have a bright cyan
wall boasting Union branding to
remind us who pays the bills, but we
will always remain an independent
student voice. Our paper is written
by students, then students edit it, lay
it out with care and then spend hours
late into the evening pouring over
every detail and making it a piece we
are proud of.
Or at least, that is what we plan
to do in theory. This issue was
conceived through gin-addled late
nights in up in the union offices,
manically inversing the colours of a
cat and being slightly concerned that
early image boards resembled those
seen in an advertising brainstorm
for a cat food manufacturer than a
student newspaper.
I’m looking forward to everyone
seeing this issue, and I hope that it
represents a foundation that we plan
to build on, rather than a final form
we will mindlessly replicate week
on week. We have many ideas in the
pipeline that hopefully will play into
the dual purpose Felix as a newspaper
emulates: it is not only a news source
for the students and staff of Imperial
College London, but also a platform
for students to develop skillsets that
they may carry with them into the
future.
Although past editors have gone
on to make waves in the media
world after they leave the basement,
many other students have left with
valuable experience in editing,
design work, photography, and
writing. You also make lifelong
friends: there is nothing like an all-
nighter arguing over the final details
of a comment article to bring people
together (I hate sappy editorials, so
my apologies).
This week is not only the “Freshers’
edition” but also a legitimate first
issue to begin the year. We’ve
stopped putting the newspaper
into the rooms of halls, so instead
of the gimmicky content previous
generations may remember, we
instead have a more well-rounded
issue for first years and final years
alike. Whether you are reading
my rambles in the library café in
between classes again, or simply
staring at the page blankly whilst
hungover in your kitchens in halls,
this issue should have something
for everyone, something hopefully
we can say about Felix the club and
Felix the paper for the rest of the
year.
Feel like getting involved?
Fancy making friends? Bored on
a Wednesday? Come down to the
office and say hi. Everyone featured
in this paper did so at one point
and another, and every editor
from previous years had to start
somewhere. Give it a shot. We print
nearly everything we are sent at any
rate, so do it just to send a clipping
home to your mother if nothing else.
