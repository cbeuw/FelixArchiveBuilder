Pavement
Crooked Rain CrookedRain
We used to love Pavement for their dopey
genius, inspired by the breath of real mania. The
music? Mad and unique, it was often excused
for the band's sake, for the idea and the lo-fi
ideology. This is not to decry 'Slanted...' or
'Westing...', but precious songs speckled those
albums like fool's gold. Tell me you never
wished for highways of 'Summer Babe' or
'Zurich is Stained': you don't wish cheaply if
you simply smiled contented at these backstreets.
Then came 'The Unseen Power of the Picket
Fence', on 'No Alternative' last autumn, and
this indie world of mirrors gasped in unison at
the anthem of tapping feet. Pavement
underslung a bass and got so funky, so funny
and poignant that it was immediately tossed on
top of the tatty piled vinyl that is the Pavement's
Greatest Hits collection. We waited.
What the press and press offices promised
has arrived. A poppier Pavement, singing about
the silly death of rock to jerk rock riffs, blues
and all that jazz. The album is a natural high, a
sudden rush that only smiles wider with time.
Malkmus bites at other bands, at triviality - "I
care, I care, I really don't care, Did you see the
drummer's hair?", and at ignoble hair cuts.
Songs? 'Cut Your Hair' is, of course, an
anthem, 'Unfair', an elated and Venice-bridged
marvel, 'Range Life' shows how to be quirky
without being irksome. Matters do tail off a
little; Heaven may well be 'a truck' but on Earth
it was the previous sunrise of songs. Perhaps by
then I'm just to happy to care. Because whereas
before I used to smile at them, now the mania's
all been given to me, is mine. (9) - Owain

From the moment the opener, ' K n i v e s ' ,
steamrollers in with its Helmet-style razor riffs,
hyperactive drums and intense vocals, you know
that you're in for one big adrenalin kick. The
wonderfully fat chorus of 'Screamager', the
deliberate Bob Mould impression in the middle
of 'Stop It You're Killing Me', the great cover
of Joy Division's 'Isolation'...the magic just
keeps coming. In fact the only downer is the
occasionally laughable lyric. Take the line
"masturbation saved my life". Well, I'm glad to
hear that it could give you a helping hand, but
did it really make you "nervous as a child?"
Still if you can get past that and like your
heavy metal blessed with a punk spirit and sharp
sense of melody, then invest in this, you won't
end up doing any teethgrinding. (8) - Vik
An absolute bumper crop to bring to you this
week. Either the food of love is in the air or the
fat accounting cats are clued up on the value of
valentine releases. Red roses and the new
Sepultura single. Enough to turn anyone's head.
Just to buck the trend we'll start with a single
released next Monday, under the banner of the
last British Rock band. They've been heralded
on every front cover under the sun, but is it all
meaningless? Primal Scream, reborn under the
watchful mixing desk of George Drakoulias (of
Black Crowes fame) kick off into the baleful
spotlight of fame with their double A side,
'Rocks/Funky Jam'. 'Rocks' is more than a nod,
actually a deep bow to the early Rolling Stones.
Spiky guitar, bar room piano and smashing
tambourine, with Bobby Gillespie trilling "get
your rocks o f f in his best lip curling style.
'Funky Jam' plugs into the New Orleans'
brassy dance groove thanks to big George
Clinton. And while there are worse things to be
than retro, I think we'll have to wait for the
album to see if they can do more than just dye
their hair black in the name of musical progress.
Let's return to Sepultura, whose cage-ridden
fans plagued the Word not so long ago. Our own
fan appears in the figure of Freddy Cheeseworth.
"They could be content to stand head and
shoulders above their rivals merely on the merits
of their intensity, sound and image but, no
they've only got to go and write good songs as

well. 'Refuse/Resist' is easily the finest extreme
metal single since 'Territory'." Fred, as he is
casually known to his friends, goes on to the
Wildhearts and their 'Caffeine Bomb ep'. "The
first two tracks are uproarious blasts of
whirlwind Punk, whilst the other two defy any
category except weird. The Wildhearts are back
on course to save the world."
To continue in the vein of being loud, nasty
and loud again, Soundgarden release
'Spoonman ep'. Ridley Dash refurbishes the
myth. "You'd think it was about drugs but fact,
as ever, is stranger than fiction. Artis, the
spoonman, is apparently a local legend in Seattle
and this is his song. He even plays the spoons
on the track, although you would be lucky to
hear him behind the roar of guitars." Another
stateside ensemble of style appears with Mr.
Greg Dulli and his 'Debonair'-cd-'ep' Afghan
Whigs. "Aside from the title track this features
'My Curse', ably sung by Marcy from Scrawl,
and a Scrawl cover, 'Ready'. It highlights the
versatility and imagination of the band." - RD
Now hold your breath as we race through a
number of things at incredible speed starting
with the lady above, Gabrielle's 'Because of
You'. "Yup, just what I expected. It's nice. The
7" mix is light and airy, same old vocal style,
and most of the same notes I'll wager." - Dave
T. Camille hits on Freakpower's 'Rush'. "They
know how to harness the cosmos. It's a funky
anthem advocating synergistic synchronism."
Piers offloads the Sultans of Ping (no FC) as
they propose to 'Wake Up And Scratch Me'.
"Energetic, vibrant, lilting and thoroughly
catchy, this is one of their best songs yet." We
end this section panting with Guy, Whiteout
and 'No Time'. "Yawn, excuse me. It's just that
I've heard it all before. They play it with more
competence than you can shake a stick at, but
it's about as inspiring as the stick itself."
Back to valentines. My own little love affair
with Holland continues thanks to Sphinx's zoet
dropjes and the release of the Nightbloom's
(above) double A-side, 'Hold On/Changes'.
Brief and pleasant, full of concentrated guitars,
background clapping and harmonising. In my
humble column it is single of the week...Tintin
...I saw another one just the other day, a special new band...
