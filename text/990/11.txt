Bella Pasta
This is a chain of Italian restaurants found all
over London. I went to the Old Brompton Road
branch and I was not impressed.
There's a wide range of pasta dishes, some
pizza and not much else. Being an impoverished
student I cook mainly pasta at home, so when I
go out I tend to avoid pasta-only places!
The starters offered are probably the most
interesting part o f the meal, but they are
agonisingly small, especially for around £3.
There are many veggie dishes and this is carried
through the entire menu, I'd avoid the starters -
they are just not value for money.
The main course. There were some house
specialities - dishes which did not consist of
pasta. There are some pizzas.I had the Calzone
(folded pizza) and liked it, but it didn't fill me
up. The same applied to the pasta dishes, they
taste fine but are a little small.
The dessert menu is a separate affair and the
names and descriptions are tantalising. I ordered
my lemon cheesecake in anticipation and it
tasted nice, but again was far to small.
Non-alcoholic drinks cost around a pound
and the service was reasonable but the waitress
kept forgetting us!
Bella Pasta is too pricey for its reputation,
atmosphere and clientele. I wouldn't go there
again, even though the food is pretty good,
there's not enough of it! A filling meal would
cost around £12.
I am afraid Bella Pasta gets 4/10.
Cuba
To make a change from the usual Chinese,
Indian or Italian when you go out Cuba is the
place to go. Unsurprisingly, the food is Cuban
and the atmosphere is like you would imagine
with reggae music blasting through your bones.
Before coming here I had never tried Cuban
food and little of the menu was recognisable, but
don't let that stop you, it adds to the thrill! You
may meet the bouncer on entering, but there is
no dress code.
The decor is a little strange and doesn't
remind you of Cuba at all. The chairs are wood
and string jobs and they are all different, but it
all fits in. The candelabras are very nice, dif-
fering from table to table and I wish I could have
taken one home with me.
Enough of the general ambience and onto the
food! The menu is in Cuban (with English
subtitles). Tapas (starters) all cost £2.75 and are
fairly large. I tried the Pulpeta (Cuban meatloaf),
and was satisfied. Try the Chorizo A La Plancha
or Machacon for something different.
For the main course there is a choice of meat,
seafood and vegetarian dishes.The portions are
huge and I could not finish mine (yep, skip the
starters). I recommend a Plato Cominado
Cubano (£10) to get a taste of a variety of things.
The seafood is good, with the Gambas 'San
Antonio' (£9) receiving a definite thumbs up.
The chefs are equally skilled with the veggie
food and people walk out satisfied, especially
with Paella Payesa Cubana (£8).
The desserts (£2.50) were a bit of a let down,
rather Western in their style. The Cuban Apple
Pie, or coconut ice-cream are about as 'authen-
tic' as I could see. I was too full to try any.
Soft drinks cost £1 and Cuban coffee is on
offer. The cocktails are large and a wide range is
available, but a jug of Margarita is the best way
to get into the swing of things.
Undoubtedly the joint is kickin': the music is
loud and everyone is evidently enjoying their
food and drinks. The food is well cooked and
even though Cuba is close to Mexico the food is
Caribbean - exciting, slightly spicy and a greater
use of vegetables. The service is good; the only
drawbacks are that the meal will cost around
£15, but I think it is money well spent. Cuba
does get busy, so it's best to book. I'll happily
go there again and again.
Cuba gets 8/10.
