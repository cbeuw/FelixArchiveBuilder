Students' Virus
The Queen's Tower - an artist's canvas;
Queen's Art
BY MIKE INGRAM
The Queen's Tower is to become
part of a work of art.
The Tower will be involved in
an exhibition organised by the
Royal College of Art. During the
'Remote Control' exhibition,
various landmarks in South
Kensington will be used by
numerous artists to create a collec-
tion of art. The artist Anne Eggebert
will be "using the devices of
surveillance and the historical
context of the Queen's Tower to
explore the conflicting emotions of
fear and pleasure which underline
the relationship between observa-
tion and power".
Other works in the exhibition
involve such things as the Royal
College of Art itself, the Albert
Memorial and a roving diplomatic
car.
The exhibition will run from
23rd February to 13th March.

A national student protest campaign
has been dismissed as a 'damp
squib' by its intended victims.
Students from the University of
North London ( U N L ) , master-
minding the Media Virus
Campaign, had hoped to involve
students from Imperial College in a
plan to cripple Government and
media organisations by bombarding
them with phone calls protesting
about student reforms (see letter on
page 23). However, despite being
in operation for more than two
weeks, the campaign appears to be
having little effect, A spokesperson
for the Department of Education
and Science - the campaign's prime
target - told Felix that the protests
"have not affected us in any way
whatsoever".
The BBC, another prime target,
was equally disparaging. Press
spokeswoman Helen Cleary burst
into laughter on being told by Felix
about the campaign. Ms Cleary
said that the B B C had been
contacted, but after checking the
records kept of protest phone calls
from the public, she stated that only
six calls from students had been
received in the last two weeks.
The unconcerned attitude of the
campaign's targets is matched by
the distaste expressed by many
student unions at the protesters'
methods. They believe that these
could alienate potential supporters
in the media. Imperial College
Union President Andrew Wensley
was briefed on the Media Virus
campaign at a University of London
Union meeting in January.
"Frankly," he said, "we felt that this
was not the best way of tackling
students' problems."
And, while the organisers claim
the Media Virus is supported by up
to 200 universities nationwide,
student unions at many of the coun-
try' s top universities have distanced
themselves from the campaign.
Undeterred by this, Justin Kirby,
information coordinator for Media
Virus, regards its first stage as a
success. In answer to the group's
critics, he said: "So long as we get
the message across that the
Government's student reforms are a
bad thing, how that message is put
across is irrelevant."
Media Virus is the brainchild of
U N L student Paul Ryan. It was
inspired by the success of Parisian
students who, in 1986, managed to
force the French Government to
make an embarrassing U-turn over
student reforms. Like them, Ryan
used college electronic mail
networks to send strategic informa-
tion to campuses around the
country. Ryan's e-mail message
calls for national newspapers and
radio stations to be targeted "posi-
tively" (in a non-confrontational
way), but adds: "Those [organisa-
tions] who fail to respond [favour-
ably], will become negative
targets."
In an interview with Felix, Kirby
outlined the sort of treatment nega-
tive targets may receive, saying:
"We want to make an example of a
national newspaper." The intention
is to pressure advertisers into
cancelling their advertising with the
paper. Top of the hit-list is The
Independent. The paper's editor,
Andreas Whittam-Smith, was
unwilling to comment at this time.
Cabinet Office Forces Imperial Out

Staff and students at Imperial
College have missed the opportu-
nity to enter MegaLab UK, a unique
nationwide experiment to be staged
as part of National Science Week,
because the College was not
informed of the event in time.
MegaLab U K will use the
combined audiences of The Daily
Telegraph, B B C Radio 1 and
Tomorrow's World as participants
in one or more mass experiments
designed around suggestions by
scientists and the public. The exper-
iment will be just one of the many
events intended to promote science,
engineering and technology during
the 'Set7' National Science Week,
which starts on March 18th.
The search for a national experi-
ment suitable for MegaLab U K was
announced on February 2nd, with
February 9th as the closing date for
entries. However, Imperial College
didn't receive the press release for
MegaLab U K and only heard of the
event when an electronic mail
concerning the event was brought to
their attention. Unfortunately, there
was not enough time for College
departments to prepare entries for
the competition. Melanie Thody,
Imperial College's Press Officer for
National Science Week said: "We
would have been delighted to enter
if we'd been given a month's notice."
A spokesperson for the Cabinet
Office claimed the press release was
sent to Imperial College along with
other academic institutions. She
said: "MegaLab U K was also
announced in the Daily Telegraph,
on Radio 1 and Tomorrow's World.
So far the response has been good,
with everyone from learned scien-
tists to youngsters writing in with
suggestions."
Despite the response to the
competition, many people feel
angry at being denied the opportu-
nity to perform useful research due
to government disorganisation.
The Cabinet Office spokes-
person commented: "We might
have preferred a later deadline, but
we needed to have responses... so
we could evaluate them in time."
