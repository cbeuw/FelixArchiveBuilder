Lesson 5. Minor setbacks
The solver can be told to reverse words or
abbreviations in order to get the answer. Take
the simple case of a word spelling another word
when read backwards, SPINS which spells
snips backwards:
Turns and cuts back (5)
1. Leaves the band reflective (5)
2. Retreating friends will strike (4)
3. Droop, phase reversed (3)
A slight variation of the same theme:
4. A n attendant returns to Princess (5)
Palindromes are words which are spelt the same
backwards:
5. A quick look in both directions (4)
6. Brought back the same look (3)
7. She's identical from both sides (5)
Of course a word could be split up and then a
reversal introduced for part of that word.
Consider the word MERCHANT. A clue could
be
R E M are back to sing about a tradesman (8)
The next two clues use abbreviations as the
non-reversed parts of the clue.
8. Restrict flow, the good man turns me (4)
9. Lot sent back to the novice on charge (4)
10. Got back a garment (4)
[See also 6,12 and 13 down above.]
Conventionally, the clue setter can write Down
clues with a sense of direction. For example
'written up', 'sent up' or 'rising' can all mean
that the answer or part of the answer is written
backwards in a Down clue. A Down clue for
TIME could be
Issue upset for a period (4)
since it would spell 'emit' when read up.
Lesson 6. Homophones
A homophone (or a homonym according to
some dictionaries) is a word which is
pronounced the same as another but is different
in spelling and meaning. For example 'sort' and
'sought' or 'rain' and 'reign'.
11. Look intensely at the escalator, you hear (5)
12. Gives you a sense of being a sound place (5)
13. Reported a smell to have been posted (4)
[See also 7 down above.]
Lesson 7. In your face
Occasionally, the answer to the clue will be
staring at you in the face - it may literally be
hidden in the clue. Take the clue for METRO:
In some trouble underground (5)
Metro is in some frouble. Since these clues are
so rare, it is easy to overlook them especially
when the clue is padded out with red herring
words. I personally like these clues so I'll give
you lots of examples (but without the
definitions in italics):
14. Develop the inside of a revolver (6)
15. Tibetan accommodates wager (3)
16. Judge in case of class essentials (6)
17. A way of letting off steam in the heart of
Coventry (4)
18. Not all will grasp right lines so be alert (13)
Beware reversals:
19. Jog back from the manure store (3)
20. Gained return form acknowledgment (3)
There's a little space to add a short note. Notice
how the straightforward definition in nearly all
of the clues so far appears either at the begin-
ning or the end of the clue. This is useful for
working out how a clue has been composed and
how the solver is supposed to interpret the clue.
