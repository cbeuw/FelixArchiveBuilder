Election Campaign Fever!
BY ANDREW TSENG
Rumour and gossip are rife this
week in Imperial College Union
(ICU) as this year's sabbatical elec-
tions get underway.
The election papers, which were
posted on Monday, have been the
focus of intense interest. Five candi-
dates are presently standing for the
four sabbatical posts. Others are
rumoured to be testing the waters
before committing themselves.
At the time of going to press the
declared candidates were: Kamran
Bashir, Lucy Chottia, Paul Thomas,
Owain Bennallack and Timothy
Brown.
Amidst a climate of what some
consider bad leadership, the post of
President has been subject to the
most speculation. Three people
have already announced their candi-
dature. Paul Thomas, U G M Chair
and last year's President of the
Royal College of Science Union
(RCSU), is proposed by ex-
President, Chris Davidson. Like the
current President, he comes from
the Maths Department. His
competitors reflect the Union's
higher profile amongst clubs and
societies. Kamran Bashir, the
Parachute Club Chairman is
proposed by Naresh Mistry. Lucy
Chottia, a chemistry student,
presently stands unproposed. She is
the Third World First treasurer.
Though not yet officially
declared, Rhian Picton and Dave
Cohen are said to be interested in
the Presidency. Some have said that
Ms Picton's Presidency of the
RCSU this year, in addition to her
year as the Biochemistry
Departmental Representative would
make her a strong candidate.
Similarly, M r Cohen would be
expected to put up a good fight
having been IC Radio Station
Manager last year and a resident in
Southside for three years.
The Deputy Presidencies are
currently uncontested. Timothy
Brown, Social Clubs Committee
(SCC) Treasurer, proposed by this
year's SCC Chairman, is standing
unopposed for the post of Deputy
President (Finance & Services). No-
one has announced their candida-
ture for job of Deputy President
(Clubs & Societies). However, it is
rumoured that Ian Parish, former
Aero Soc Chairman and present
Guilds' Departmental Societies
Chairman, may decide to stand
before nominations are closed.
Last year's election for the post
of Felix Editor & Print Unit
Manager saw an occasionally
unpleasant contest after which
several of the Felix team left. To
date, only one person is standing:
Owain Bennallack, Felix Features
Editor. He is proposed by Jon
Jordan, Music Editor and fully
seconded. Joe McFadden, the
Cinema Editor, has also declared
his interest in running for the post.
Both students have been heavily
committed to Felix for the last year.
The campaigning will begin
once the papers come down on the
25th of February. The voting will
take place in all departments on
Monday 14th and Tuesday 15th
March. The results should be
known on the Tuesday evening.
All four sabbatical posts are of
course being contested by New
Election. You should vote for this
if you feel no candidate is suitable
for the job.
Monkey
Business

A new national poster campaign
has been launched to protest against
experimentation on animals. The
British Union for the Abolition of
Vivisection ( B U A V ) is targeting
the Barbados tourist industry at the
height of the holiday booking
season.
The aim of the campaign,
launched on Tuesday, is to press
the island's Government into stop-
ping the export of wild monkeys
for laboratory experiments. The
posters feature contrasting images
of a tropical beach and a group of
caged baby monkeys. The slogan is
simple: "Barbados - you won't
want to leave and neither do they."
Leaflets are to be distributed
locally and public awareness events
will be held outside travel agents.
50,000 protest postcards are also
being targeted at the Barbados
Board of Tourism.
