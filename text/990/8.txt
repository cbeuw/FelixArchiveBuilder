Swimming Success For IC
After last year's suspension of aquatic activities
at Imperial College due to the refurbishment of
the Sports Centre, this year has seen the highly
successful revival of the Swimming and Water
Polo club.
On Monday and Thursday of last week we
took part in the U L U Swimming Championships
finishing first overall. The women's team came
second after George's and the men's was also
second after UCL.
The most remarkable performance on our
team was Stephanie Summers', who finished as
the best female individual swimmer. She
impressed everyone when she won the 110 yards
backstroke with a big lead over her opponents.
Of the men's team, James Ralph finished as
the second best male individual swimmer.
Thursday's gala was followed by a short
reception after which the IC team went on to
consume cast amounts of Sangria, a custom that
had already been introduced on Monday.
In all, it was a damn good laugh. Thanks to
Raimund for moral support and showing us how
to party - the continental way!
The next challenge will be the B U S F
Championships held in Leeds in mid-March
where we hope to continue with our success.
The 46th
Annual Hyde
Park Relays
Tomorrow sees the running of the 46th Annual
Hyde Park Road Relays. Organised by the
Imperial College Cross Country Club, it is one
of the largest student events of its kind in
Europe, attracting over one thousand
competitors from universities in Britain, France,
Sweden and Holland.
Over the years, the race has seen many of
this country's greatest athletes during their times
as students, including former Olympians Alison
Wyeth, Sebastian Coe and David Moorcroft and
London Marathon winner Hugh Jones (who
holds the present record time).
Spectators are always welcome, so come
down and support the race, if only to try and
shake off Friday night's hangover.
Commemorative T-shirts will be available on
the day and our sponsors will be present with
brochures and information about the latest
sportswear.
The race starts at 2pm by the Dell Restaurant
next to the Serpentine, with a prize giving
ceremony to follow in the JCR.

One day I learned that Science was not true.
I do not recall the day, but I recall the moment.
The God of the 20th century was no longer God.
