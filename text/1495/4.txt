THE FELIX EMERGENCY PARTY GUIDE 2011
Cat Mask
We’ve all been there. ‘That per-
son’ has organised an impromptu
fancy dress party, and you can’t be
bothered to haul yourself outside to
spend £20 on a lame outfit that looks
less like Batman and more like a po-
tential offender. Why not wear fresh
newspaper instead? Actually, don’t.
Just attach this to your fridge or some-
thing – draw on it. Just don’t wear it.
