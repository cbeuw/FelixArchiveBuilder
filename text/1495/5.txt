Fake ID
You can’t wait for a night out on the
town – trouble is, you’re a little too
young to be allowed into this grown-
ups establishment. Never fear, Felix
is kind enough to provide you with
your very own customisable ID card
that may or may not work wherever
you go! Just tear this bad boy out,
fill it out with a spare crayon and de-
liberate whether this is a new low.

Chat-up lines
Heading out for some serious party-
ing, are we? Out on the pull, eh?
Looks like you need some brushing
up on your flirting technique. Lucky
we’re here to offer a few sure-fire ex-
amples of verbal heroics guaranteed to
at least get the attention of the oppo-
site sex. Awww yeah, they’re unisex!
Mad enough to use all
of this?
We love a bit of good-natured
humiliation down here, so if
you’re actually gosh darn nuts
enough to even attempt to use
this stuff, send some evidence
to felix@imperial.ac.uk and
we’ll feature it right here in the
paper, you crazy Freshers, you
“You’re like a parking ticket.”
“‘Cos I’ve got fine written all over
me?”
“No, cos you look like you’ll cost
me £50.”
“I wish I were your derivative so I
could lie tangent to your curves.”
(NOTE: 0% success rate)
“You’re hotter than sunburn.”
“I never fail to succeed...baby.”
“Are your legs hurting? ‘Cos I’ve
been relentlessly chasing you.”
“Your last name must be Jacobs.”
“It’s not.”
“Only – you’re a real cracker!”
“Call me Gillette – I’m the best a
(wo)man can get.”
“GRAB YOUR COAT, YOU HAVE
PULLED.”
“My body is ready.”
“If in doubt, whip it out.”
