Welcome Freshers...to the Puzzles Sec-
tion. First up, we’ve got Bridges. You’re
gonna love it. Those circles over there
are islands, and the number in the centre
represents the number of bridges out of
it. Bridges extend out horizontally and
vertically – maximum of two each way!

A personal favourite, right here. Tran-
scending the boundaries of 2-D space
and wasted time comes the almighty
Slitherlink. Students love it, lecturers
love it and you definitely love it.
If you’ve ever played minesweeper,
and let’s face it, you were probably
bored enough at some point in the
distant past, then you should be able
to understand this puzzle. The num-
ber in each box represents the num-
ber of lines that can exist around it.
Lines can never cross, so look out for
that. Normally, it’s a good idea to start
with the ‘0’ boxes. In the end, you
should (fingers crossed) end up with
a closed loop.
If you’re a bit lost (and I don’t
blame you), have a gander at the ex-
ample solution to the left. All should
become clear. If it doesn’t, ask a hall-
mate. Just don’t ask me, I’m up to the
eyeballs in puzzles at the moment.
Better get some practice in now,
I hear there might be a super mega-
awesome puzzles leaderboard turning
up very soon in the weeks to come.
I don’t even feel dirty for just writ-
ing that expression, it’s seriously that
good. I’m not even kidding, just you
wait.
Sudoku, but with words. Or to be more
precise, letters instead of numbers. And
as we all know, everything is ten times
better in words than it is in numbers.
Just imagine this is a normal sudoku,
and make sure each grid features each
of the nine letters. Each row and column
must consist solely of the same nine let-
ters. When complete, a row or column
will spell out a word – in this case, a
clue being ‘something you should ex-
pect from every Wordoku we print this
year’.
There’s a handy example over there of
how to complete this puzzle like a com-
plete boss. Happy puzzling!
