FRIDAY 30 september 2011
Looting, Libya, and chaos on Capitol Hill
Dear Freshers and regular readers, wel-
come to a new year at Imperial; a new
year that brings new experiences and
new challenges. The politics team in
Felix hopes to keep you interested in
the politics of the outside world while
you spend your year in the bubble of
university life.
However, since we’re all returning
from the summer holidays the first issue
is going to give you a short summary
of what has happened over the summer
while you’ve been vacationing/intern-
ing/preparing for university etc. Some
of these things will be talked about for
years to come, stories to tell the grand-
children, or the kind of things that you
can discuss with people with whom you
have nothing in common. Should also
be useful for some of those awkward
post-holiday conversations on the first
day of term…
If you’re looking at this page and
thinking that writing about the latest
political developments from across
the globe is right up your street, then
you might just want to be a Politics
Reporter. If you’re interested, get
in touch with the Politics Editors at
politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
We gear up for another year of politics by rounding up the events of the summer

On August 6, the death of Mark
Duggan during an investigation
by police officers from Opera-
tion Trident two days earlier led
to a protest outside Tottenham
Police Station. It is said that
due to uninvolved criminal ele-
ments a riot began in the area,
in which two police cars were
set alight.
For four consecutive days ri-
ots spread, first through differ-
ent areas of London and then
throughout the country. The fo-
cus of the rioters seemed to be
looting and destruction instead
of having a political or firm
ideal. There were several at-
tempts by politicians and me-
dia figures to try to single out
the cause of the tensions that
resulted in such widespread
crime but no one true agree-
ment was reached.
Europe’s financial stability
took a huge blow this sum-
mer as Italy and Spain joined
the list of Eurozone countries
with unmanageable sovereign
debt.
After a loss in confidence
in the Euro and a rise in the
bond yields for the aforemen-
tioned countries the Euro-
pean Central Bank stepped
in and bought large amounts
of Spanish and Italian bonds
in a show of confidence. This
measure caused some in-
vestor confidence to resurge
leading to a fall in Italian and
Spanish bond yields. However,
when lower than expected Eu-
rozone growth results were an-
nounced, especially from their
economic stronghold Germa-
ny, investors began to panic
causing erratic financial mar-
ket behaviour, with European
shares losing the most.
This summer’s events have
led to people re-evaluating the
effectiveness of the Eurozone,
with some German citizens be-
ginning to despair at having to
help fund bailouts for fellow Eu-
rozone countries who struggle
to manage their government’s
budgets. Some people, includ-
ing former French President
and Prime Minister Jacques
Chirac are calling for the intro-
duction of Eurobonds, bonds
that are backed by every coun-
try in the Eurozone, hoping to
provide a product with more
stability. However this idea
has met strong resistance in
the form of incumbent German
Chancellor Merkel and French
President Sarkozy.
With the uncertain future of
Eurozone fiscal stability, some
consider the summer of 2011
the possible first chapter of
the end of the Euro.
President Obama’s summer
hasn’t been as great as he
hoped. This summer he has
had to deal with trying to in-
crease the US Debt Ceiling.
The debt ceiling is a limit
of debt owed to the public by
the government. This doesn’t
mean that the government
can’t run deficits, rather this
piece of legislation controls
the amount of money the US
can borrow from bondholders
and public trust funds like So-
cial Security. Unless this limit
is increased the government
cannot legally borrow any
more from these sources. This
means the government would
start to run out of money to
fund its departments and pay
back its expiring debts (e.g.
bond interests).
Usually raising the debt ceil-
ing doesn’t cause a major
issue in Congress however
the Republicans used it as
a chance to hold the govern-
ment at gunpoint while it de-
manded budget cuts and the
abolishment of certain federal
programs.
After a very tense few
months where temporary stop-
gap measures were agreed on
by both parties, a compromise
was made between the de-
mands of the Republicans and
the desires of the Democrats
which allowed the bill to be
signed on the 1st of August,
just before the government
ran out of money. However,
Mr Obama has suffered some
negative press as a result of
how close the government was
to defaulting on some of its
payments.
For a very long time the fi-
nancial world has seen the US
bonds as a very safe invest-
ment, however after the US
debt crisis the markets are no
longer so quick to buy Ameri-
can debt, with many preferring
to trade gold instead.
The crisis also led to ratings
agency Standard and Poor’s
decision to downgrade its as-
sessment of US bonds from
its top AAA rating in AA+,
something that has caused
the US great embarrassment.
As early as March this year we
saw the Arab Spring develop
and pick up pace. Countries
across the world were taken by
surprise as a series of revolts
occurred in different nations,
with dissatisfied citizens re-
belling against their distant
and corrupt governments, led
by the large amount of unem-
ployed young people who used
social networking to spread
their ideals.
The most widely covered re-
bellion has been the uprising
in Libya where Col Gaddafi was
ousted after 42 years in power
by the determined rebel-led
National Transitional Council
with support from the United
Nations. At the time of writ-
ing, the new leaders of Libya
the NTC are searching for Col
Gaddafi and his missing family
who are hiding with pockets of
still-loyal supporters.
UK Europe US Middle East
Senior politicians were derid-
ed for not immediately return-
ing from their holidays after
the first day of riots. However,
eventually they returned for the
people with London Mayor Bo-
ris Johnson walking the streets
of Clapham Junction trying
to offer platitudes to the ag-
grieved public and Nick Clegg
holding a public meeting in Tot-
tenham Town Hall.
After the riots had settled,
police named and shamed
suspected rioters, and after
political pressure the justice
system handed out harsh pun-
ishments to those convicted.
The Metropolitan Police were
flooded by accusations of mis-
managing their response to
the riots with many saying that
they had been too soft, leaving
many residents and business
owners to be subjected to the
full force of the roving mobs.
President Obama, not reading
Felix. We need to break America...
While this happens, weekly
protests are still taking place
in Syria where the popula-
tion are desperate to unseat
President Bashar al-Assad. A
series of violent attempts to
repress the protests by the
government has lead to sanc-
tions by the EU and US. Who
knows what will happen as the
year comes to an end?
