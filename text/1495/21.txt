FELIX Friday 30 september 2011 21
Scorpio
You complain to Felix about the
horoscopes, arguing that they are
unnecessarily vulgar, bordering on
misogynistic. “Bollocks,” comes the
reply, “now fuck off back to the kitchen.”
The Editor is officially warned and equal
opportunities horoscopes are enforced.
Horoscopes
Aries
You’ve come here looking for the
future? Right this way, please. This
week you get ready for one serious
Fresher PARTAAAY with your new
chums. Oh sorry, you weren’t invited.
You prelash alone, much like a complete
dickhead would. You party alone. Fuck.
Taurus
Jesus, it’s late. You’re crippled by a lack
of self belief. Will you finish the five
lab reports due in tomorrow – the end
of your first week here? Fresh Prince-
era Will Smith appears and says some
inspiring shit, before demanding a
blowjob. Summertime’s over, baby.
Gemini
You wake up feeling as sore as that time
you had a vigorous make-out session
with that bearded tramp. You suddenly
realise that was last night. Back you go
to the Union, downing snakebites and
getting off with the toilet. You win an
award – the prize cunt award, that is.
Cancer
Afellow Fresher suggests that you all go
on a ‘mental trip’ to a ‘leading Haymar-
ket nightclub’. It’s fucking expensive
and you’re routinely sexually harassed
all evening. It’s not all bad though, a
coked-up wide-boy city wanker shoves
a pint glass up your arse. Score!
Leo
Your desperate hunt for like-minded
people will take a sinister turn this week
when you casually mention to your hall-
mate that you enjoy Twlight. You wake
up that night – naked, tied up and cov-
ered in shop-bought glitter.Ahench man
dressed as Bella sits opposite, whining.
Virgo
You discover that the ‘ghost’ haunting
the fairground was actually Old Man
Simms all along! As he’s taken away,
Scoob looks up at you intensely, as if to
say “we’ve been through a lot, Shaggy”.
You caress the fur... You wake up. Your
roommate asks to switch rooms.
Libra
You’ve finally gotten to that stage in a
relationship (yeah right) where you’re
ready to admit to your ho that you were,
in fact, rejected from Oxbridge. She
frowns and ponders, “I thought you
were clever...” She leaves you. Fuckin’
girls, how do they work?
Sagittarius
This week your so-called new “friends”
call you a cynical bastard for saying
that you “won’t actually be friends after
Freshers’ Week, cos then we’ll settle into
our respective social strata.” You spend
the remainder of your degree alone in
your room, crying and wanking.
Capricorn
Oh man, that hottie in lectures is
looking at you again. Jesus, they can’t
stop it. A fit redhead too, hnnnnng.
You pluck up the courage and sit next
to the dreamboat. But, shit! You’re too
nervous to speak. Your progress with
the opposite sex is set back two years..
Aquarius
This week a posse of West End-based po-
ets rock up to your room all hard like after
you heckle their shit public performance
and post ‘hilarious’ comments about it
online. Too bad you didn’t look past their
thick framed glasses and notice the mer-
ciless hunger in their eyes... to kill.
Pisces
It’s the start of a new month, a new uni-
versity, a new life! Who knows what
could be on the horizon: beautiful friend-
ships? Excellent learning? Or even, dare
you say it... romance? Let’s see... nope,
nope and... hell nope. Additionally, you
will never get laid. Have a good one!
Aunty McPickle: back to
solve all of your problems
Dear Aunty McPickle,
This is the first time I’m reading Felix,
and I saw a cut-out cat mask on page 4.
I want to make a good first impression
with the other freshers. I’m scared I’ll
look like a complete dick wearing the
mask at a party... but then perhaps not?
Yours Anxiously,
Scaredy Cat
Dear Scaredy Cat,
Oh come on, you’ll most likely have
less sex than your counterparts in other
unis. You’ll go to sausage fests and gurn
all over the only (minging) girl. And
that right bicep will get a lot bigger over
the next four years.
My advice: wear the damn mask. At
least then they’ll be a cat at the party,
even if there’s no pussy.
Miaow,
Aunty McPickle
Dear Aunty McPickle,
I have just moved into halls. There’s a
BO-smelling 2nd year on my floor, a
“hall senior”. He keeps pestering me
and cracking lame chat-up lines. How
do I get this vile creep off my back?
Annoyingly,
Miss Hot Tits
Dear Miss Hot Tits,
These 2nd year seniors have only
stayed in halls so they can try and
shag any fresher with two tits and a
vagina. Their mates will accuse them
of “being paedos”, they’ll respond
with “it’s legal”.
But then, a shag’s a shag. And it’s
freshers’ week! That’s all you’re
supposed to be doing, shagging and
drinking. At worst, shove a dildo up
his arse and see how he responds.
Keep me updated,
Aunty McPickle
Dear Aunty McPickle,
I have an oozing sore on my right in-
dex finger. This makes it very difficult
to play Civ5.
Yours painfully,
The almighty destroyer of worlds
Dear The almighty destroyer of
worlds,
You’ve over-stretched yourself.
You’ve built to many cities and can’t
afford them all, can you? Barbarians
are at the gate. And you’ve nowt but
a lone archer to face the world with.
Over-extended metaphors aside,
you’ve clearly been playing this game
too long. The sore on your finger is a
sign that you would do well to heed.
Advisedly,
Aunty McPickle
Dear Aunty McPickle,
I don’t believe you exist. In fact, this
whole page just looks like a lame
space-filler, with the crap jokes, and
stereotyping Imperial in the worst
possible way.
Sincerely,
Anally-retentive reader
Dear Anally-retentive reader,
Call me:
0763-YOURMUM-566-000,
Aunty McPickle
Dear Aunty McPickle,
I’m scared about meeting new people.
I’m really nervous. What’s the best
way to make new friends?
Sincerely,
John Smith
Dear John
Erm... this sounds rather too genu-
ine a concern. Call NightLine.
Byeeeeeeeee,
Aunty McPickle
