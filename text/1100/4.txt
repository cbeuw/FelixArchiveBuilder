Do you thrive on constant change and the challenge of
making things happen? If so, we can promise a uniquely
attractive career at the forefront of the global gas industry.
Created earlier this year from the demerger of British
Gas pic, B G pic is a young and vibrant company with
dynamic plans for growth. Our most visible role is to own
and operate the U K gas storage and distribution system -
one of the largest and most advanced in the world. But
we are also active on a global scale. Our Research &
Technology Centre is internationally renowned for
producing innovative technical solutions, while our
Exploration and Production interests span four continents.
In order to meet new challenges and drive forward
development, we offer graduate opportunities in Geology,
Geophysics, Engineering, IT, Business/Commercial roles,
H R and Legal Services.
Starting in September 1998, our development
programme is tailored to meet your individual needs.
Formal training and professional study will support
practical hands-on experience, and the opportunity to
make a visible impression from your very first day.
We are looking for high-calibre people who can
confidently expect to achieve a 2:1 or a higher degree.
You will be teaming up with a major force in the energy
industry - already a world leader, yet just starting an
exciting new chapter in its corporate development.
Make that change and take the challenge - contact our
Human Resources department on 0118 929 3261 for an
application pack, or see your Careers Advisory Service.
Closing date for applications is December 5th 1997.
