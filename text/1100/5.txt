SWIPE GRIPE
Dear Felix
What I want to know is that in
this marvellous age of technology
when everyone gets a swipe card
with their photo, college status (eg
student) and expiry date clearly
marked on it:
1) Why do 1 have to spend 2
pounds to get a mugshot from a
booth so that
2) the union can spend more
money on manufacturing a union
card, spend time on putting it
together and heat sealing it....
just so 1 can go to daVinci's to
have a beer. Why can't college stu-
dents just use their College ID to
gain access to all student facilities?
It's not as if I'm paying a member-
ship fee up front to the union that
requires a separate card as proof of
membership.
And on the cost saving aspect
this flash swipe card could further
be used as a library card now
couldn't it!!!
Sincerely
Guy Bennett, Mech Eng PG
MILAN THE M A N
Milen the Mister Mahadevan
I just want to say to y'all, what a
kikkin, in your face, mean mutha
Milen the Mister, your new colum-
nist is. He represents. Much
respect to Felix for havin' him in the
show. He is one cool cat.
The Man: Jivin Gerald
The funky follower,
Of choclate flava'd choons.
OK, so its good to see a shift
from the domination of generic
indie in the review section of
felix, with the addition of the hip-
hop section, and Milen's 'inspired'
commentary, (1 assumed it was
someone taking the piss), now
hows about something towards the
other end of the spectrum.
Considering the number of excel-
lent releases in this genre recently,
there have been remarkablly few
reviews, most of which have been
bad. At least give the stuff you do
get, to people who may appreciate
it and know something about it.
For anyone interested, and I know
there are people out there, the
unofficial Rocksoc meets in
Southside upper lounge Mondays
1 pm, and ICRadio has its very own
metal/rock show at 9pm every
Monday.
Yours longwindedly,
Steve.
Jivin, we'll pass on your com-
ments to Milen, we're sure he'll
appreciate them.
Steve, nice to know you read
the reviews but what would be
the point of only giving people
music that they love? If every
review got 5 stars then there
wouldn't be much use in compar-
ing albums. Also if you feel you
could write better reviews we'd
love you to come and write for us!
Come to the meetings on Fridays
at 1.30 pm. Laters. Music Eds
ERIC WRITES
If you put your head above the
parapet, one must reasonably
expect to get shot at: if not shot.
To this end I have generally avoid-
ed replying to factual inaccuracies
in the letters page in Felix over the
last year and a half. However, as I
was writing in anyway this may be
an opportune moment to compen-
sate for the interesting spin that Ms
Harries put upon the OpSoc story
last week.
Firstly, no single society has a
God given right to use the Concert
Hall, despite what some may think,
and it has always been allocated on
a first come, first served basis, with
no credence given to tradition or
historical precedence. Charing
Cross and Westminster Medical
School Light Operatic Society, well
aware of the fact that would be
unable to use the Wolfson Hall this
year, asked if they would be able to
use the Concert Hall. This request
was made about two months in
advance of ICU's illustrious and
normally well organised operatic
society.
All bookings for rooms are
made at the Union Reception, and
whilst I did indeed sign a letter I
twice stated the caveat that my
support was conditional on the
availability of the Concert Hall
being confirmed.
What 1 find most peculiar about
the rant last week, besides the
inaccuracies and the double stan-
dards being requested, was that a
solution was found to the problem
and agreed upon some three
weeks ago. This maybe due to
OpSoc not achieving the booking
they wanted. However in these
times of expansion and the resul-
tant pressure on facilities, clubs
and societies will have even more
organised or embrace the new
diversity and, heavens forbid, co-
operate. Or possibly Ms Harries
has committed too many produc-
tions to memory and is now unable
to differentiate between fact and
fiction.
As for the various bleating
regarding the alleged block voting
all 1 can really say is put up or shut
up. If people realistically think that
the medical students are sheeplike
and vote en masse for a prescribed
candidate as laid down by their
executive they are fooling them-
selves. Every member of the Union
is entitled to express his or her
opinion at the ballot box. If the
medics feel that the sabbatical
elections warrants a, high turnout
and the remaining South
Kensington students a low one;
well then that's democracy. It is,
after all, a rather false argument to
start whinging after the event par-
ticularly when it's an event that the
majority of students felt no desire
to participate in. Perhaps an analy-
sis of why members feel so disen-
franchised from the electoral
process would be slightly more
constructive.
On a lighter note I would like to
thank everyone who made my time
as President so enjoyable and in
particular those that have given
support during the last six months
for what otherwise may have been
a particularly difficult period for the
Union. There are many people 1
could single out but I will limit
myself to the collective of the
Union staff who do a sterling job
and without whose expertise and
dedication the Union would be not
what it is today.
As always I have no interest in
epistolary duelling so if, in the
unlikely event, people wish to
comment further 1 would appreci-
ate if they save it for my face: and
if it happens to be in the bar then
mine's a Guinness.
Regards, Eric Allsop
