Disappearing Departments
BY MATTHEW BENNETT
The Geology and Earth Resources
Engineering departments are liv-
ing on borrowed time following
the announcement that they will
cease to exist on 31 December
1997. To ease the pain of parting,
i l m is being offered for the
refurbishment of the crumbling
Royal School of Mines building.
Sir Ronald Oxburgh, Rector of
Imperial College, announced the
creation of a new 'school' within
the Royal School of Mines (RSM)
which will merge the Imperial
College Centre for Environmental
Technology (ICCET) together with
the loss making Geology and ERE
departments. ICCET may not dis-
appear completely, with the possi-
bility that they may continue to
exist as a Centre within the new
school being created.
In a lengthy statement Sir
Oxburgh explained how these
mergers would enable cross disci-
plinary groups to be set up more
easily in order to "exploit the grow-
ing scientific and practical opportu-
nities for work on the environment
in its broadest sense". He com-
mented that the boundaries
between disciplines are not set in
stone but merely points that "at
some particular time may have
appeared as an activity minima
between them."
The Rector expressed his belief
that the new school would "provide
both a unique opportunity to tackle
some of the major problems con-
fronting society in the next centu-
ry." The new venture is to be
named after TH Huxley and partly
funded by a Â£1 million bequest
from Mungo Park, an RSM student
between 1897-1900.
The last structural change in the
RSM, the 1994 modification of
ERE's title, provoked opposition
from academic staff who felt that
they had not been properly con-
sulted. Professor Rees Rawlings,
current Dean of RSM, has trumpet-
ed the high morale of his staff
emphasising that "the staff of the
two departments concerned are
looking forward to the future after a
period of some uncertainty."
In an attempt to calm student
apprehension over the loss of
departmental identity Prof Rawlings
insisted that "the merger will not
affect the students on undergradu-
ate or masters courses, as these
courses will continue in their pre-
sent form." He also added that a
full range of courses would contin-
ue to be offered.
The new school is due to be
established on 1 January 1998, with
the fast rising Professor John
Beddington as director.
BUSA Single Entry Friday Night Fracas
BYMARIA IOANNOU
Imperial College Union is to
make a decision at next week's
Council Meeting as to whether
Imperial College School of
Medicine Union (ICSMU) should
continue to enter their own
teams, separate to IC, to com-
pete in the British Universities
Sports Association (BUSA)
Championships.
ICU President, Eric Allsop, has
been mandated by the Union
Executive to write a paper for ICU
Council on the issue. When ques-
tioned by Felix, Mr Allsop said "This
paper will comprise of three parts.
The first part will outline the facts
The revitalised Ante Gallery in
the Sherfield Building opened
this Monday with the first of a
series of exhibitions entitled
"Art Lab Project" curated by
Chelsea College of Art graduate
jeanine Tulkins. This series is
an attempt from the artist's
part to push new ideas. Ms
Tulkins described this as "an
exciting, challenging and
unusual opportunity for the
artists, who have responded
enthusiastically to this invita-
tion." She added that "people
should not come here with an
expectation to fully understand,
but to come with an open
mind." The gallery is still under-
going refurbishment, but the
exhibition is currently on dis-
play. Photo: Aliki Ceorgakopoulou
and background. The second part
will contain my opinions on the
matter and the paper will finish
with a motion for a single-entry."
This proposal will not have the sup-
port of ICMSU. The Sports and
Clubs Representative of St Mary's,
Katy Sheehan, said "If ICU Council
vote for single-entry, 1 think it is
unreasonable. The medics have
proved themselves to be strong
enough to put an entry in that war-
rants an entry." She added "The
medical schools have a long-stand-
ing tradition and reputation, and
we very much want a separate
BUSA entry." "People don't want
to play for IC, IC has always been
the opposition."

On Friday 14 November an ex-
Royal School of Mines student
was punched in the face resulting
in a painful injury. A brief scuffle
also occurred involving the Union
stewards as he was thrown out
of the Union Building.
Earlier that night the ex-stu-
dent, who cannot be named, had
been at the 1 13th annual RSMA
dinner attended by the Dean of
RSM where he had consumed
alcohol. According to eyewitness
accounts he had come with a
friend, also an ex-miner. After the
dinner he and his friend went to
the Union Bar where they drank
some more, and according to
those present, started to become
'a bit of a nuisance'. Felix was also
told that whilst in the Union bar
the first ex-student chatted with a
female student who was with her
boyfriend. The boyfriend did not
take too kindly to the friendly man-
nerisms of this person: a witness
said that her interlocutor was "a lit-
tle too friendly with his hands".
It is believed an exchange of
words followed, during which the
boyfriend grabbed the other man
and got him into a headlock before
punching him in the face. An eye-
witness said the punch resulted in
the skin on the bridge of the nose
splitting leaving the bone exposed,
and added that there was a lot of
blood. After delivering the blow the
boyfriend, realising that his actions
may have incited RSM students
present in the bar, left the
premises.
All the stewards, except those
at the gate, were called to the
scene. It was the stewards' belief
that the ex-student was the
aggressor, so under Union policy
he had to leave. He and his friend
were led outside and marched out
of Beit Quad. At the gate he began
to get aggressive, angered at what
he thought was unfair treatment.
Stewards reported that both he
and his friend threw several punch-
es at them. After security was
called the situation was diffused
without any further intervention.
Mark Home, ICU's events manag-
er, told Felix that the incident is
currently undergoing investigation
by the licensees of the Union bar.
