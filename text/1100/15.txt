CLUBSCENE - THE UNDERGROUND MUSIC GUIDE
H
ere's a big cliche, and I'm
going to get it out of the
way right now (decide for
yourselves whether or not I'm
being sincere). Meeting Spencer
Kinsey (aka Gemini) was actually
one of the most pleasant and fulfill-
ing experiences I've had in the
musical aspect of my life. Some of
his ideas and beliefs inspired me
and made me think about subjects
outside of music; and music out-
side of house.
Born in Chicago, Spencer
Kinsey moved to LA at a young age
and returned to Chicago (and a
brand new musical vibe called
house) when he was 16. Due to his
definition of this music, he
does appreciate LA for
inspiring and influencing
him. "I look at house as an
extension of rhythms that
have been around for thou-
sands of years. That's all it
really is." This is how he jus-
tifies David Bowie's Let's
Dance as being a house
record before house music ever
was.
Spencer Kinsey took his pseu-
donym from his starsign. Having
released music under his real
name, he decided that the people
of Chicago who knew him were not
giving him honest or constructive
feedback. To get their real opin-
ions, he decided to invent a secret
identity for himself.
A scan through Gemini's
lengthy back-catalogue indicates
that he has been releasing material
for only four years. If you consider
the fact that today he can produce
three consistently excellent albums
in as many months then you'll
understand why 1 use the word
only. In fact he believes that he has
been creating music for a lot longer
through his DJing skills. "1 would
take one record, and another
record, and mix them together and
find myself actually making a song.
And it was like, oh wow!"
DJing has actually changed
through time according to Gemini.
"It used to be just playing records,
then it went into just mixing, and
now it's into making music." Thus
was born Gemini's theory of evolu-
tion!
Gemini is one of a few artists
who can bridge the gap that has
formed between house and tech-
no. His records appeal to a wide
audience of electronic listeners and
appear in the sets of some of the
world's most respected DJs. As a
DJ he himself has played at some of
the world's most prestigious
events. None of this appears to
have gone to his head, however.
The way he acts and talks suggests
'Look what happened to Frankie
Knuckles. He left Chicago.' And it's
like look what happened to him.
Nothing much really! He just did
the same thing he's always been
doing." Maybe this could be a les-
son to some of us who think that
good drum 'n' bass originates sole-
ly from within this country.
Gemini is a prolific artist,
releasing over twenty records in his
career. He doesn't limit himself to
one label either, arguing that he
found the Chicago record houses a
little too claustrophobic for him,
run by people who were, in his
opinion, limiting his music to cer-
tain people and not realising that
moves

A
a childish innocence, even an igno-
rance from his perspective to the
impact of his creations.
When I tell him how much I like
a certain track from his last album,
he smiles and says "cool" as if in
surprise. When 1 ask him at the
beginning of the interview what he
does, for the benefit of any listen-
ers who are unaware of him, he
shrugs and says very matter-of-
factly, "I just make some music."
Try telling 300,000 crazy, loved-up
clubbers at the 1995 Love Parade
that the guy playing to them just
makes some music!
Gemini claims that his music is
inspired, in part, by his surround-
ings and environment on a global
scale. "Everything I see, hear, feel;
it's just all a part of the music to
me. 1 put it all into my music." I
was struck by his attitude that good
house music doesn't necessarily
come from Chicago. "I don't think
it's where you're at; it's what
you're doing. Some people say
they could reach a wider audience
with a little more effort. "When I do
music I want it to be heard. I don't
want to be shuffled under a rug
somewhere."
Influences in his life include
personalities from all walks of life
(Aristotle, Robert de Niro, Miles
Davis, Thomas Edison to name but
a few). He believes that they are all
people "who have pushed things to
another level within themselves."
This is the message that he says he
is trying to put across in his music
today.
Gemini's message to any young
DJs or producers hoping to make it
in the music industry is simply,
"Always compete with yourself."
He doesn't see the point in being
influenced by something else to the
point of copying that sound. "Look
at everything else...as influences
and things that you like. But when
you sit down to make music just
compete With yourself."
Gemini was a thoughtful inter-
viewee, carefully considering his
answers throughout. His sense of
humour was carefree and infec-
tious. His child-like aspect may not
suit the high-octane lifestyle of
London, but surely it is this that
allows him to imagine and conceive
musical collages that can whisk you
into a sense of complete freedom
and lightness.
At the end of the day, Gemini
taught me (in his own quiet and
indirect way) that ultimately
we are all into music and
that everything else we
plaster all over and label it
with is necessary but super-
ficial and should be treated
as such.
You can hear the full
Gemini interview and some
of his music on the Electric
Cafe on the Network on IC Radio
this Sunday night from midnight
until 2am.
Gemini has three albums that
are currently available:
Imagine a Nation (Relief Records)
In and Out of Fog and Lights
(Peacefrog)
In Neutral (Distance)
The Electric Cafe, in asssosia-
tion with phuture trax is giving
away three copies of Gemini's new
album In Neutral. If you would like
to win one of these, then all you
have to do is answer this question:
What state of America is
Chicago in?

Many people have got Into house music via the sounds that have been
emerging from Chicago since the mid to late 1980 s and up to the
present day. Artists such as Frankie Knuckles, Larry Heard and Mar-
shall Jefferson originally put the city on the musical map. Add to that
the long list of a new wave of artists including Boo Williams, D| Sneak
and Paul Johnson and you have a musical scene whose greatest char-
