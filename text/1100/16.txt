m ANIMALS ON WHEELS
Designs & Mistakes (Ninja Tunes) * * * *
T
hey say there a fine line
between genius and mad-
ness, this album is on that
line. Animals on Wheels has been
created by Andy Coleman. He
takes us on a journey out of the
ordinary, to a world where every-
thing is weird.
Track 1 sets things off in a
down beat style then tearing
amens come in raising the tempo
to D&B speed then you're up and
down for the rest of the track, a bit
of a insight into how the rest of the
album proceeds. Next is a great
D&B track on an intelligent tip with
nice crisp beats cut in and out over
strong atmosphericals. The pace
slows down over the next few
tracks, much more minimal with
the odd stabbings of beats here
and there. Some are soft, others
are harsh and hard. Then the pace
is lifted again with Shoddy Kicks,
again in an experimental D&B style.
The last few tracks comprise of
some beautiful down beat numbers
and superb D&B. This album was
created, not made, it fits together
perfectly. Just sit back, spark up a
fat one and be taken on a journey
to the outer realms in a way that
only Animals on Wheels can take
you. This is as underground as it
gets, not one for the faint hearted.
A lot of people just won't under-
stand this album. If you're looking
for something different, a glance
into the future, then this is worth a
listen. I'm sure that some of these
experimental ideas will be devel-
oped and used in more main
stream D&B, if there is such a
thing. This is also a useful collec-
tion of tunes to have on vinyl, with
quality D&B tracks and some nice
and weird down tempo numbers
suitable for just chilling to.
If this is your type of music or
you just want to find out what I'm
going on about, check out
Coldcut's end of tour pre-
Christmas party. 4th Dec at 333
Old Street, a night not to be
missed with some of the best
scratch DJ talent in the world. The
things these guys do, makes the
likes of your house 'n' jungle DJs
look like they haven't even learnt to
mix. See club listings. 1

Pete Tong
Essential Selection * *
I
didn't expect much from this
CD as I have never respected
Pete Tong much as a mixer, but
reputedly he gets up to £1,500 a
set. So he must be doing some-
thing right. You'd expect to be
taken on a musical journey, with
outstanding mixing and a visionary
selection of tunes. And what do we
get? Well none of the above.
CD01 starts off with the funky
Gritter Shaker by David Homes,
then the essential selection goes
all wrong with Deep Dish's
Stranded. This tune just doesn't
work, starting things off on the
wrong foot. There's also a lot of
quality tracks on this CD like
Industry Standard Vol. 1 and Popper
Presents Aura's Every Little Time.
But it's the occasional chart top-
pers that are dropped in now and
then that kill any sort of vibe.
CD02 sets off with DJ Dado's,
Back For Me a fat bouncy tune,
then things are running along nice-
ly, when Nain & Kane's Beachball
comes in. I've seen this tune clear
dance floors, it's too laid back 'n'
dreamy, no punch to it. Then a few
tracks later, in comes Dario G's
Sunchyme. 1 really don't like this
tune, it bores me with the way it
just plods along. Things get harder
towards the end with the likes of Y
Traxx and Mysteryland. Then total-
ly out of the blue Roni Size's Hero's
is dropped in. Yes, D&B style,
probably the most commercial
D&B track around at the moment.
A quality tune, but very commercial
and it seems to me that Pete
Tong's jumping on the band
wagon, putting a token D&B track
on the end. Oh, what an essential
selection he's chosen, NOT. The
same goes for the last track on this
compilation, Black Gold.
Overall, 1 wouldn't spend hard
earned cash on this compilation as
there are so many better ones
around. This compilation is OK if
you want tunes you know from the
radio, but you aren't really into the
scene. If you're looking for quality
mixing, a bit of effort going into
working and cutting the tunes, and
with each tune following on from
the previous one, which is the
whole point of DJing, in my humble
opinion, then this CD sadly falls
very short of the mark. 1

CLUBSCENE - SINGLES
D R U M ' N ' B A S S U S E G A • A G E
Hidden Agenda - Sons / 12'
Seconds
(Creative Source 016)
Release: Dec.
This is not as strong as the previ-
ous release from Creative Source,
it's in the same musical rolling style
without such strong beats, nice to
just sit back and listen to. 12'
Seconds is the stronger of the two
tracks and showing D&B is an art-
form with well structured beats,
strong atmosphericals and a slight-
ly eerie feel. Again Creative Source
are keeping D&B moving forward
with their innovative styles of deep
rolling steppers, Intelligent D&B at
it's best.
To check the Creative Source mas-
sive live & direct, with their trend
setting styles of D&B get your-
selves down their new club night at
The Velvet Rooms starting 26th
Nov. and evey Wednesday then
on.
Teckniq - One Style/911 * * * *
(Formation Rec.)
Release: Dec.
This the first release for a while for
Teckniq, and they haven't lost
their touch. One Style is on a more
jump-up tip with echoing beats, a
rhythm setting bass drum and with
a wicked b-line; this is certain to be
big in the clubs. 911 has a darker
more experimental feel to it, keep-
ing with Formations way of not
being afraid to try something new
'n' different. So two quite different
and quite excellent tracks.
Formation still going strong.
Amon Tobin - Piranha Breaks
(Ninja Tunes)
Release.Out Now
This is as experimental as D&B
gets, Amon Tobin mixes his unique
blend of Latin Samba vibe & breaks
with crazy amen driven beats, too
heavy on the samba beats for me.
Fast Eddie the 2nd track, was my
favourite & more of an out 'n' out
D&B No. Heavy use of amen
breaks, fast & hectic with deep
base tones. If your looking for
something on the Eclectic tip, the
outerlimits of the D&B spectrum
this is well worth checking.
DJ Supreme vs Rhythm Masters -
Enter The Scene * * *
(Distinctive) Release: Nov
If you haven't heard this one yet,
you must have been locked in a
cupboard or something for the last
6 months. With the distinct'ive
vocal's of DJ Supreme,
timestretches, scratching and
building beats it's been a big hit in
the clubs and on the radio over the
summer. Finally getting released, 1
feel a little to late as it now sounds
old and dated due to it being
Cained for to long before it's
release. This has also given it that
commercial feel, not one for the
die-hard.
Spinning Atoms 3 - The Enhanced
Velocity EP * * * * (Prolekult
Rec.) Release: 8th Dec.
This can only be described as
falling somewhere between bang-
ing hard house & techno. Fast
bouncy bass drum, echoing beats
and pleasant dreamy breaks. All 4
tracks (2 mixes of Bubble Memory
to choose from) are rocking. It you
like it hard, fast & hectic this is for
you.
Underground Vibe - Free Style
Orchestra * * * (Sweat Rec.)
Release: Dec.
Track A l . Til da Break starts off
with a funky garage thing going on,
then in comes a dreadful
Saxophone sample total killing the
tune. If it weren't for that Sax it
would be a good track. Lost the
plot on that one. But luckily there's
SSO Groove Dub mix that saves
the day with a different use of sim-
ilar sounds and a grinding b-line it
works out nice.
Rodd-Y-Ler - The Art Work EP
* + + (Blue Banana Rec.)
Release: 8th Dec.
All three tracks on this one are in
that banging House style. The
strongest of these is the A-side
(funny that). Starts off with a flute
that could be out of Arabian nights
or something then it gets down to
business with bass drum taking
control and a bouncy b-line. This
one keeps building nicely into a
pleasantly hard track. Well worth a
listen.
