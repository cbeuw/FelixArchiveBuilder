P r a e d Street U n s a f e
BY JITEN PATEL
It has emerged that Praed Street,
the road that passes between St
Mary's Medical School and
Wilson House hall of residence,
has recently been highlighted as a
crime blackspot.
A rape that was reported in last
week's Felix occurred during the
summer on 2 July when a young
Asian student, with no connection
to the medical school, was blind-
folded and held at knife point by
one man whilst another went to
pick up a car. The girl was then dri-
ven to a house and repeatedly
attacked during the night, before
being dumped near Wembley
Conference Centre the following
morning.
The incident was first brought
to the attention of the students
when a relative of the St Mary's
Accommodation Officer, Natasha
Newton, saw the incident reported
on BBC's 'Crimewatch' on Tuesday
11 November. The medical school
was not informed of the incident
apparently because police thought
that it was not necessary that peo-
ple should be notified of the prob-
lem.
Oliver Warren, St Mary's
Welfare Representative, told Felix
that he "personally went into every
lecture and warned the students of
the need to be alert." He also said
that over 300 rape alarms had been
handed out to male and femle stu-
dents who wanted them, and that
notices had been posted around
the school.
Although this was an isolated
incident, the safety of the area
around Praed Street has been dete-
riorating for some time. Ms
Newton spoke of an occasion
when she "had five offers for a
good night, mistaking me for a
working girl" in the space of 5-6
minutes. Another reported incident
involved a female student being
followed back to St Mary's from
Safeways supermarket.
The current security measures
around Wilson House are "inade-
quate" according to Mr Warren,
who said that the security lodge is
closed after 1 1 pm and that there is
no on-site security. He added that
cameras have been installed ar-
ound the area but that the relay
network has not yet been set up, so
that they only record onto video-
tape.
According to Keith Reynolds,
Imperial College's Head of
Security, there are plans to "have
the patrol at St Mary's extended to
Wilson House," but that he had to
ensure that he doesn't "stretch
resources to far". Other plans
under consideration are to intro-
duce 'group walking' at set times,
or to run a minibus service similar
to that at the South Kensington
campus.
Ms Newton added that "the
main problem is that students think
of Praed Street as an extension to
the campus", and cautioned stu-
dents "to be aware of the people
around them."
Tuition Fees: Placards in the Park
BY IVAN CHAN
Another major demonstration
was held in Hyde Park on
Wednesday 26 November to
protest against the imposition of
tuition fees. Although it was
thought only 2,000 students
would attend, an estimated
10,000 turnout reflected the
anger of students towards one of
biggest changes to the British
university education system.
This is the second such event
to take place in London during the
last month. The demonstration
began at noon outside the
University of London Union in
Malet Street. The student protest-
ers then marched into Hyde Park
near Speakers' Corner at Marble
Arch.
The demonstration was organ-
ised by the Campaign for Free
Education (CFE). According to one
of their press officers attending the
event, the demonstration marked
the beginning of a series of

protests across the country. The
official insisted that the demon-
stration was 'fantastic' and added
that it was "one of the biggest for
the past five or six years." He went
on to say that around 60% of
Labour MPs are in favour of free
education. CFE marshalls along
with police officers at the scene,
were happy with the behaviour of
the students, suggesting that the
rally had been 'peaceful'.
