R
adiohead are a group that
always impress when it
comes to their experimenta-
tion with song and style. Recently,
as a result of their last album OK
Computer, they have been unfairly
branded as a second-rate Pink
Floyd or as being dull and plodding
in their style. Their reaction to the
critics has been extremely noncha-
lant and they have carried on doing
whatever they wanted to do and
however they wanted to do it. OK
Computer is full of neat sound
effects and mood-creating washes
of noise that enhance all of the
tracks. Therefore the test of their
ability would always be whether or
not they could reproduce their
sound live.
Lights, smoke and some
strange dance tracks. People were
smoking cigarettes next to me and
Jarvis Cocker was sitting in the
gallery just above the mosh pit
waving like royalty when Airbag
crashed down onto the crowd.
Like a person in a car crash that's
just been whiplashed, this song
turned everyone's head to the
stage. Thorn Yorke acknowledged
the audience only briefly before
launching into the excellently
schizophrenic Karma Police with its
haunting piano stomping merci-
lessly over the slightly non-sensical
lyrics. Jonny Greenwood never
remained stationary throughout
the whole two hours that they
played. He moved between the
piano, guitar and various other
instruments that surrounded him
with alarming talent and style. This
also highlighted the fact that every
single nuance of the albums was
played. From the eerie tinkling at
the beginning of Lucky to the vari-
ous bits and pieces that adorn
Paranoid Android, all of the effects
were played live. This left no holes
in the sound which plagues so
many bands who insist on record-
ing tracks with a thousand over-
dubs.
There was a slight problem
with the gig, though. It had nothing
at all to do with the band, but
rather the venue. Arenas really sap
a band's performance - the atmos-
phere inside them is always so
remote that you feel distant from
the band. Admitedly, the light
show and the spectacle might have
been better than in a smaller
venue, but the closeness that a
member of the audience would
feel to the music at one of these
was sadly missing. Something
seemed really cold about the
whole thing. This manifested itself
quite blatantly as the very mosh-
worthy chorus to My Iron Lung
screamed out from the stage,
prompting a very confused reac-
tion from the massive crowd.
Some wanted to mosh whilst the
rest just didn't want to move at all.
Half of the crowd had a vibe, the
others just didn't seem to realise
what was going on. This is a real
shame because Radiohead played
an absolutely spotless set. There
was everything there to make a
good gig but it was like a souffle -
someone must have opened the
oven door to have a look at how
everything was going and it just
deflated.
All of this complaining still does
not detract from one thing,
though. Radiohead are a fantastic
band and even though the venue
did not suit them, 1 wholehearted-
ly recommend seeing them. USAIok
LAB REPORT
Excision No Stars
L
ab Report are aptly named as
everyone knows here at IC
that lab reports are the most
dull, boring, and inanely monoto-
nous things in the world.
Pigeon holing Excision is hard
since, in my vast musical experi-
ence, 1 have never heard anything
like it before. In fact the album
does beg the question is this really
music at all or just a random con-
coction of clock ticks, match-strik-
ing noises, chimes, interference,
door creaks, gunfire and dodgy
beeping sounds? There also seems
to be considerable portions of
many tracks dedicated to utter
silence. Strange, very strange
indeed. What seems even stranger
is that there appears to be no
drum track or rhythm used at all.
Hmmmm.
The tracks overall have an
eerie, distant film soundtrack feel
to them. The first track, In The
Beginning consists of a few discor-
dant notes, weird wailing sounds
and a deep drone that goes on and
on. Christ Playing With Tops does
literally sound like 'Christ' is play-
ing with one of those Da-da toy
cars, a whisk and, true to the title,
some milk bottle tops. Really it
does. The last track, Geeks Choose
To Work In The Carnival, is the
best, if that word can be used to
describe any of Lab Reports music.
Lab Report should never have
been signed or allowed to make
this sort of avant-garde, experi-
mental, classical crap. I would pre-
fer to listen to 62 minutes of
someone farting down a digeredoo
than ever disgrace my hi-fi by
putting this Lab Report in it again.
This is one for playing Frisbee with.
