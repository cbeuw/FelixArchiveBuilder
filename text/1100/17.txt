FICTION
LA CONFIDENTIAL
James Ellroy * * * *
A
s early as the prologue, a
taste of the casual, total
violence of this tale is
expertly and shocking offered up,
dropped into the dialogue with the
off-handedness you would expect
from a comment on the weather.
Ellroy's trademark taut, brutal, and
relentlessly self edited style does
not read easily at first; the mean-
ings some of the Americanisms
and police terms are not immedi-
ately apparent (1 imagine that
Californians have a little trouble
with Irvine Welsh novels), but it
settles down swiftly and you are
left reeling by the sheer complexi-
ty of character, the depth of the
intrigue and the hammer blows of
revelation that strike at every turn.
No character takes the hero role;
each man's virtue is tainted by cor-
ruption and lies; including the bril-
liant young war hero, Ed Exley,
despised by his peers when after
testifying against the police in a
brutality scandal, whose real, horri-
B O O K S
ble role in the massacre which won
him a medal is guaranteed to turn
the reader's stomach. This young
detective and the embittered, cor-
rupt and free-wheeling "Trashcan"
Jack Vinncenes, (whose friends
were implicated in Exley's testimo-
ny) are forced to work together to
solve a savage murder. Things are
not made easier by the presence
of the (obligatory?) vampish
female... and there are always the
gossip journalists...
Ellroy's precision of language
and his forceful pace do not shirk;
if anything it draws you further and
deeper into the tale; it leaves you
breathless as to the conclusion;
which character is going to snap
first? This, for any genre of writing,
is intelligent, well structured and
original; a closely observed take on
hatred and fear. As a crime thriller,
it is supreme. O

STAYING SANE
revention is better than cure
I and this Is certainly true for
M the mind as well as the gen-
eral state of the body. Discussing
mental health in the open is con
sidered a taboo subject; many joke
about it but no-one really talks
about it openly.

Nigel Linacre No Stars
T
here must now be thousands
of books like this - all
promising clear advice on
taking exams, preparing for inter-
views, achieving spiritual enlight-
enment or whatever. I have had a
look at these in the past, and with-
out exception, they have all been
completely useless; packed with
the most banal and obvious points
there could be. Each of these
books also had a selection of clear-
ly made-up anecdotes to fill up
some more pages. 'The Successful
Executive' sticks rigidly to this pre-
sumably successful formula and
contains seventy-two sections "in
which the author shares the
secrets of his own success". So,
what are Nigel Linacre's 'pearls of
wisdom' ? Well, let me give you a
few of his finest thoughts:
"2.2 Have bits and pieces
handy " - he suggests placing sta-
tionery and documents where they
can be found later.
"2.3 Use your diary" - that's it.
"3.4 Organise your time" - with
the following ridiculously contrived
mnemonic: "Priorities, Organise to
achieve them, Execute the neces-
sary tasks, Think about what you
have achieved and Recharge
Yourself." It truly is poetry.
"5.10 Avoid being ineffective" -
sitting at your desk doing nothing
is unproductive. Revolutionary!
I admit that these are probably
the worst points made and that
some of the other sections could
be of some use, but these are few
and far between and are still not
useful. The book is full of either
repetition, or incompetent advice,
as shown above. I can not see how
any potential executives here
could benefit from this book in any
possible way. If you are going to
be a successful executive you
should not need to be told what to
do with pens and pencils and you
should not be forced to waste £ 10
and your valuable time in buying
and reading this book.
