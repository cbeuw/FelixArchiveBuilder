Tickets for the 1997 "Shaken Not
Stirred" Christmas Carnival are now
available from the Union Office or
DaVinci's Bar.
The spirit of Bond takes over the
Union Building with Moneypenny's
Casino in the gym, where you
could win an Aston Martin, Pussy
Galore's Cocktail Bar with vodka
martinis, sophisticated cocktails
and an eclectic soundtrack. For
space age fun there'll be a gyro-
scope in the quad & the evening's
incidental music comes from
Hedonizm in the concert hall and
the Pop Tarts in dBs. Live music is
on an indie tip with The
Beekeepers, and Bratpop.
The Union will be fully decked out
to match the Bond theme, and the
guests are expected to do the
same - so Bond or Bond girls
please! Tickets are £6 or £5 with
an entscard. We're expecting to
sell out, so get moving!
BIZARRE
As editor, I frequently have to deal
with random people appearing in
the office to submit truly strange
offerings. Sometimes this is a prob-
lem; it's horrible to watch someone
retreating, tail between their legs,
because their masterpiece has
been rejected. In this case, howev-
er, it was a source of considerable
amusement. We truly have no idea
where this came from:
T O O LITTLE, T O O
LATE
The turnout at this week's tuition
fee protest was encouraging
(although the Imperial delegation
was five-eights of bugger-all), but 1
was a little surprised when I heard
who had organised it; not the

E & O
Apologies are due to the Islamic
Society for the continued non-
appearence of their paintballing
article. The appropriate heads
have been banged together and it
appears in the sports section this
week.
National Union of Students, but the
Socialist Worker. Full marks to SW,
but where the hell were the NUS?
The whole point of that union is to
represent students and relay their
opinions to those in charge.
Students, to a man, are rejecting
the fees but the NUS seems to
have a weak, deterministic attitude
and is making very little noise. The
rules CAN be changed (just look at
the series of concessions already
made over gap-year students and
means-testing), so what are they
playing at? The sad truth is that the
NUS presidency is little more that a
fast track to the Labour govern-
ment, so clearly they have to prac-
tice spouting vacuous crap.
Indeed, according to Private Eye,
three ex-presidents who are now
MPs fail to even mention their
position in Dods (the parliamentary
bible). AH three are however keen
to point out their directorships of
Endsleigh Insurance, a company
that is both unashamedly promot-
ed by the NUS and denounced by
Watchdog as rip-off merchants.
So get off your backside, Mr
Trainer, reread your job descrip-
tion, ditch that policical rhetoric,
and do what the students tell you.
