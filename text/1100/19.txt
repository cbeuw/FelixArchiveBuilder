ALIEN RESURRECTION REVIEW AND COMPETITION
FILM
ALIEN RESURRECTION
Starring: Sigourney Weaver, Winona Ryder
Director: Jean-Pierre Jeunet
E
verybody's favourite alien-killer is back.
After Sigourney Weaver's Ripley character
killed both herself and the alien inside her
in Alien3
, audiences would be forgiven for think-
ing they had seen the last of her. But fortunately
this is not the case as Ripley has received the
Jurassic Park treatment and been reconstructed
from a blood sample taken 200 years earlier in
the third instalment.
The motive behind this genetic engineering
will raise a smile from anybody who has wit-
nessed the aliens' legendary ferocity. The
military of the future want to extract the chest-
burster inside Ripley and tame it, thereby
breeding the perfect all-round work animal of
the future. This dubious venture takes place on
a space station heading for Earth, thus making
the inevitable rampage all the more threatening
to mankind.
What distinguishes this hokum from the rest
of the films in the series is that the resurrection
process means Ripley now has a substantial
amount of alien DNA inside her. This gives her
the advantage of superhuman strength and,
more interestingly, a sixth alien sense. She is
aware of this alien streak and her loyalties are
divided between humanity and the rioting crea-
tures who are, in effect, her offspring. Long
gone is her despising of the species as we see
her empathising with and even having a semi-
erotic relationship with the Alien Queen. Weaver
is on top form as Ripley displays touches of
alien behaviour and resigns herself to battle
once again.
This personality development is not restrict-
ed to Ripley. The director gives us an insight into
the aliens' minds as they display emotions and
demonstrate intelligence. This is a refreshing
change to the treatment the monsters have
received in the past and makes for some mem-
orable scenes as they concoct a plan to escape
from their confines. Jean-Pierre Jeunet also
spends time on Ripley's human allies. Winona
Ryder is cast as a mercenary on a mission to
wipe out the aliens and is the subject of an inter-
esting twist towards the climax.
Alien Resurrection has less action than its
forerunners but this is no bad thing. It is more of
a suspense thriller than an action film and this
allows time for some clever predictions of
futuristic life from the director. There are also
19
plenty of amusing one-liners which were
not present in the first three films but
provide welcome relief here. All in all, an
excellent science fiction film and just what was
needed to put the Alien series back on track. O

THE CD FILES™
TRIVIA GAME
O n V i d e o
W
ho is the production
designer on The X Files?
What is Dana Scully's
middle name? What is Mulder's FBI
Badge Number? If you couldn't
care less; stop reading this review.
If these are the questions that
dominate your lecture breaks in the
common room then The X Files
Trivia Game on Video will be at the
top of your Christmas list.
The idea of this board game is
simply to reach the opposite end of
the board before your opponents.
You move forward by correctly
answering questions related to the
video clips of episodes from series
one to three of the cult sci-fi pro-
gramme. These questions fall into
four categories; Character, Story
Line, The Unexplained and Behind
the Scenes. The category you
answer is chosen by rolling a die
and there are also Action Cards
which are occasionally beneficial
but are more likely to move you
back several spaces. And that's it.
Once the novelty of the video
clips wears off there is little here
except for die-hard fans of the pro-
gramme. Questions are split into
easy and hard categories but even
the "easy" ones are taxing unless
you can remember the finer details
of episodes which were televised
years ago. The game only includes
the first three series so to stand a
chance of making progress you'll
need to have been a fan ever since
the pilot episode. However, if you
are a dedicated follower of Mulder
and Scully and have equally com-
mitted friends then you will doubt-
less think this is the finest board
game ever made. You'll also know
that the answers to the posers
above are Graeme Murray,
Katherine and JTT047101111.
Obviously. D
