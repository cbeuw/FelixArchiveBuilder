MORE LETTERS 28 November 1997
©STAR LETTER©
Dear Felix,
Recently, 1 have noticed that
the less politically-motivated mem-
bers of our college have been
recieving a very bad press. I am
writing this letter to redress the bal-
ance and take an opportunity to
speak out for the lazy and unopin-
ionated majority.
We at the Society of Apathetic
Dossers (a.k.a. SlobSoc) make up
one of the largest student organisa-
tions on the campus, yet our inac-
tivity always seems to go unrecog-
nised. For many years we have
been campaigning vociferously for
the right to remain silent, and our
existence is founded on the belief
that no-one should be afraid to
exercise their democratic right to
indifference. We have over 1000
members, and the depth of their
support and solidarity for our prin-
ciples is shown eloquently by the
fact that only three of them have
ever turned up to any of our meet-
ings.
Over recent months we have
become increasingly annoyed by
the Union, who seem to have been
constantly bullying us into forming
opinions about who to vote for.
The Union hacks are always bother-
ing us with their silly election cam-
paigns, and it has taken four rounds
of elections for them to get the
message that we just DO NOT GIVE
A TOSS! Last week we once again
siezed the opporunity to sit back
and not get noticed, and this time
the silly idiots finally got what they
deserved. It is about time we let
someone competent like the
Medics or Sherfield do the job, or
better still avoid the hassle of hav-
ing a Union in the first place by
closing it down and getting it con-
verted into something useful like
conference facilities. Do they not
realise that they're just creating
extra work for themselves? I've
even heard that there are some
people at the Union running clubs
and scoieties who don't even get
paid for it! Are they complete
morons or something? They're the
kind of people who think that the
right way to deal with something is
to keep pestering important college
officials about it. But this just caus-
es lots of unecessary aggravation
on both sides. We believe that the
proper way to air your grievances is
to spend a couple of hours moan-
ing and whinging about them with
your mates in the pub, and then
forget it. That way, you can be
seen to care about something with-
out having to take the trouble of
actually do anything about it, and
everyone will be a lot less stressed.
As for our stance on tuition
fees, we wholeheartedly believe
that they're not eally that bad. I
would even consider pawning my
Playstation to get a place at IC,
becasue it has such a great atmos-
phere and is full of the most won-
derful people. To prove this point,
we went on a march to Trafalgar
Square with placards saying 'WE
DON'T REALLY MIND THAT MUCH
ABOUT TUITION FESS' and 'TONY
BLAIR IS OK'. No-one really
noticed us, so I think we can claim
to have had much more success
than the protestors.
If you wouldn't like to get up off
your arse and get involved with
anything, don't bother coming to
our next meeting, where we will be
discussing how best to avoid mak-
ing A decision about when to have
the next meeting. 1 doubt anyone'll
turn up anyway.
Yours sincerely,
Colin Dale,Physics 3,
Chairman, SAD.
only when one sees first-hand the
environmental and social damage
that unethical investment causes
that you see an over-powering case
for an ethical investment policy.
Companies that pollute the envi-
ronment, such as the oil industry,
need money and to carry out their
dirty deeds, some of this money
comes from investments by finan-
cial organisations. Oppressive
regimes that torture and murder
their people need the means to do
so, they buy their weapons from
arms manufacturers which do not
care what their weapons will be
used for, just as long as the sale
makes a healthy profit.
In today's world, money sadly is
power, and without it polluters and
arms manufacturers cannot contin-
ue to do what they do. A financial
organisation that invests in compa-
nies that pollute and produce arms
enables these companies to carry
on. If all financial institutions
adopted an ethical investment pol-
icy, these polluters and arms pro-
ducers would find it very difficult to
CURRY
C O N F U S I O N
Dear Felix,
Ali Campbells "Thought of the
day" raises an interesting question.
The fundamental fact that has been
missed is that curry bills follow the
law that states that the sum of the
parts is not equal to the whole (or
whatever the law says?). This
means that if you work out what
everyone had and then added it
together and included service and
damage this will still not be equal
to the bill, even in honest restau-
rants. There are two ways to over-
come this problem, split the bill
evenly and rely on the fact that
after knowing someone for four
years what you all really owe each
other is irrelevant or just make
some excuse and leave early thus
landing the bill with someone else.
Yours faithfully
Nick Newton, ICSM
S O U N D BUSINESS
Dear Felix,
1 write with reference to Mr.
Baker's column in issue 1098. It is
continue without investments, and
it would also send a message to
them to clean up their act.
If a company is "doing some-
thing dicey" it does not automati-
cally mean the truth always gets
out about it. There are several
dodgy dealings of companies that
never make it to the attention of
the masses because they keep
quiet about it, or silence people
who protest about it, or the media
is not interested or legally unable to
report it. Coupled with a politically
apathetic nation means that com-
panies can get away with murder,
literally.
I invite Mr. Baker, as an intelli-
gent man, to open his eyes to what
is beyond the boundaries of his
own life.
