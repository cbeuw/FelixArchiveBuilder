8 COLUMNS 28 November 1997
Sagittarius (23/1 1 - 23/12)
Bonding between a couple of friends
this week, indicated by the Two of
Wands, leads to an astonishing revelation.
Listening is the hearth of good communications,
so remain attentive and patient.
Capricorn (24/12 - 20/1)
The dominany force of Temperance induces a
calm and cautious state of mind. However
excessive hesitation only serves to confuse your
personal decisions. Remember that Destiny is
not a matter of chance but a question of choice.
Aquarius (21/1 - 18/2)
The ruling Queen of Pentacles highlights a
haunting and distracting temptation, exceeding
the bounds of logical reason. Events of an
adventurous nature are predicted for the follow-
ing week, but beware to avoid disappointment.
Pisces (19/2 - 20/3)
The influence of the Emperor grants you
great courage and determination to achieve
your heart's desires. Failure is not defeat until
you abandon the cause, so pursue your quests
faithfully and with time, the tide will turn in your
favour.
Aries (21/3 - 20/4)
Considering the dreary weather, a cheerful
mood is certainly spiritually uplifting. Indeed,
attitudes are contagious so make yours worth
catching. The King of Cups warms your heart as
you anticipate evenings of relaxation and cele-
bration.
Taurus (21/4 - 21/5)
The overpowering presence of the Seven of
Pentacles reveals that you are embarking on a
turbulent and disruptive week, with an unex-
pected setback. Remain vigilant throughout and
avoid the squandering of precious time.

Gemini (22/5 - 21/6)
Despite emotional torment and unsatisfaction,
the wise High Priestess is bountiful with regard
to professional success. Take pride in deserving
recent performances, reflecting boosted self
confidence and increasing initiative.
Cancer (22/6 - 22/7)
Guided by the myserious Magician, a suprise
concerning the renewed contact with an ancient
aquaintance awaits discovery. Revival of fond
memories leads to a fundamental reshuffling of
your ambitions and priorities.
Leo (23/7 - 23/8)
The Knight of Swords, symbol of conflict and
confrontation, indicates the existence of major
misunderstandings within a close relationship.
Your life is entering a new phase in conjunction
with Sunday night's New Moon, so ideally resid-
ual problems should be resolved now.
Virgo (24/8 - 22/9)
Today's worries, like puddles, always evaporate
by tomorrow, so be prepared to take risks.
Under the Page of Wand's protection, the future
appears tranquil giving the opportunity to
explore new horizons.
Libra (23/9 - 23/10)
To experience the rainbow, you must suffer
through the rain, therefore expect periods of
light depression. The universal Nine of Pentacles
highlights the often misleading doubts lurking
within your imagination.
Scorpio (24/10 - 22/11)
The piercing Ace of Swords indicates shattered
ideals, which have deeply affected your aura.
You cannot direct the wind, but you can adjust
the sails, so seach for an original and inspiring
vocation.
