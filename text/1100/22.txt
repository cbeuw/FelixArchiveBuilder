SENSATION
ARTS 28 November 1997
Royal Academy of Arts
S
ENSATION, the most spoken
about and controversial exhi-
bition of the Fall, presents
the works (of Art ???) of young
British artists (YBAs) from the
Charles Saatchi collection.
What is the aim of the exhibi-
tion? - Contemporary art is always
debatable and the whole event
comes down to a few very philo-
sophical questions; What is Art?
What are its limits, if any? What is
an artist?
The display falls aside any yet
given definition. We are at the
antipodes of Gautier's reflections,
of the Theory of 'L'Art pour l'Art'.
Beauty and refinement have defi-
nitely been brutally torn away from
the notion, even deliberately 'spat
upon'.
"SENSATION is an attempt to
define a generation" - Not mine
thank you !
Here, Art becomes brutality,
vulgarity, violence, corruption, per-
versity. This exhibition is that of the
anti-aesthetic.
SENSATIONAL it is, in that it is
a SENSATIONAL display of the
decadence of British culture. It cer-
tainly reveals something about
British society. England prides itself
with having the freedom of organis-
ing such an event but it constitutes
yet another blow in her ever weak-
ening aura.
Seeing the crowds pressing
round the entrance, at the till to
buy the catalogue and posters,
mainly reflects this nation's peo-
ple's voyeurism, avidity for sensa-
tion and scandal. This should not
be surprising , considering the
overall mediocre quality of the
British media, even whose most
reputable titles have more than a
strong propensity to fall into sensa-
tionalism.
A small mention at the entrance
warns that "there are works of art in
this display which some visitors
may consider offensive", and a cap-
tion asks parents to exercise their
own judgement in bringing along
their children, which did not pre-
vent couples to contemplate sculp-
tures of hanging men, with severed
heads and genitals, in the most
bloody way, with their five year old
daughter.
Damien Hirst is probably the
key artist of the exhibition which
features his formaldehyde-pre-
served animals, including such
works as "This Little Piggy Went To
The Market, This Little Piggy Stayed
At Home" - a pig sliced into two,
each part placed into two parallel
tanks of water and formaldehyde,
which are driven by a mechanism
so that they separate on a track :
the animal's innards are progres-
sively revealed as one side slowly
moves forward.
The visitor can also walk in
between 12 tanks of 'pickled'
sliced cow - "Comfort Gained From
The Acceptance That The Inherent
Lies In Everything".
"A 1000 years", supposedly
"rehearsing the life-cycle and mon-
strous spectacle of death" is Hirst's
most repulsive display : a huge
glass cube is home to thousands of
flies, which are bom there, feed
from a dead cow's head - a big
large piece of raw flesh -, mate and
eventually die through (yet another
morbid invention) the "insect-o-
cuter". Needless to mention the
strong odour emanating from it and
its incredible bacteria breeding
capacity...
One also finds one of Hirst's
spin painting - wonderfully boring -
entitled "Beautiful Kiss My Fucking
Ass", whose translation into anoth-
er language is truly unthinkable.
Why is therefore 'acceptable' in
English ?
This exhibit is in fact part of a
gallery, whose admission is prohib-
ited to under 18s, with strict ID
control. Two particularly unhealthy
displays stick out : James Rielly's
"Random Acts of Kindness" is inde-
cent as much in its association with
the work, or even more, as in the
numerous little panels showing a
pedophile and his victims in many
different situations. Particularly in
today's context, with all the dra-
matic events we hear of everyday,
it is utmostly shameful.
Jake and Dinos Chapman's
"Zygotic Acceleration, Biogenetic,
De-sublimated, Libidinal Model
Enlarged *1000" is a ring of
Siamese mannequins, whose heads
are attached to one another by
vaginas. Their noses have become
penises and their lips anuses, with
particular research carried out into
shapes and sizes and let's say
'interaction'. Out of what kind of
human brains can such ideas be
born ??? It is at this point that the
offence of claiming to be "defining
a generation" takes its maximum
proportions.
Amongst other exhibits, one
can find Marcus Harvey's "Myra",
an enormous painting based on a
police photo of Myra Hindley, con-
victed for the horrific murder of
children, in the mid 60s, serving a
prison sentence for life.
Globally, this exhibition
explores the taboos of sex, evil,
death, drugs and the human body
in no constructive way, very crude-
ly and with a great deal of perversi-
ty, aiming to shock for the sake of
shocking and 'de-ennobles' such
an institutins as the Royal Academy
of Arts.

NEW MEDIA CENTRE
Institute of Contemporary Arts
H
ave you ever fancied
expressing your digital cre-
ativity? The Institute of
Contemporary Arts lives up to it's
name with the launch of a new
media centre as it enters it's 50th
year. This is a joint venture with Sun
microsystems which has con-
tributed two million pounds to
establish the centre.
As technology continues to
advance, it's impact on society and
culture is becoming more evident.
This centre should allow genres and
technologies to meet and collabo-
rate leading to the transformation
of existing art forms and the emer-
gence of new ones.
The centre consists of several
powerful computer stations run-
ning a new development named
Java. This is a 'language' which
enables computers and networks
to interact across the Internet irre-
spective of make or location. So
the public will be able to access
these facilities, many of which can
be run on the average PC.
So, what can you do with this
new artifice?
CREATE. Animations, audio-
visual packages, it will even be pos-
sible to produce a C D . or film over
the website.
Martin Lambert, director of
marketing and technology at Sun
compared this project to the early
movie Industry in the I890's,
where cameras were available but
people were unsure how best to
use them.
Sun will therefore be providing
sponsorship for a resident artist,
who will explore the boundaries
between science and art using the
various programmes.
Some examples of electronic
artwork were exhibited at the
opening of the centre. Richard
Brown's Alembic was a combina-
tion of animated 3-D visuals with
sound; A representation of the ele-
ments, earth, fire, air and water,
which reacted to surrounding
movements. The contorted pinkish
column in the centre of the dark-
ened room became oddly relaxing
with the addition of the synthe-
sised, ambient sounds.
The introduction of the centre
also provides a welcome digital
exhibiting space which will be
viewed across the globe.
Computer workstations are cur-
rently available for public use at the
ICA in the cafe area between 12.00
and 18.00. The rest of the centre
will remain exclusive while it
becomes established.
Computer experts from Sun will
be on-hand to give advice on how
to operate programmes and how to
make the most of the technology.

This includes the ICA archive and a
chance to review the latest digital
artwork.
