ALBUMS COMPETITION
O SMASH MOUTH
Fush Yu Mang
Tl
'his album seems to confirm
the suspicion that punk is in
fact dead. Smash mouth
sound like a cross between NoFX
and the Beach Boys without the
musical abilities of the latter or
even the taste of the former, (if you
know what I mean). They manage
to combine dire, teenage vocals
with tasteless percussion and a
guitar tone that leaves you scream-
ing with frustration. Tracks switch
from feeble, lifeless reggae to fast
punk several times within a single
song, all of which are cramped full
of the worst, most obvious riffs
that you have ever heard, (the sort
of stuff you learn to play on the
guitar as a spotty adolescent).
The only thing that they can be
credited for I guess, is that they
don't take themselves seriously,
but then again, does anyone? The
gimmicky humour of the sudden
Ska-like changes from calm to
Smash Mouth? manic get on your nerves after
Looks like it about ten minutes and leave you
wondering why they bothered. I'm
afraid that their attempts at satire
and self-mockery fail miserably
despite the promising sound of
some of the song titles. Beer
Goggles, The Fonz and Padrino. if
it's humour they want, they could
learn a great deal from the greats
like Frank Zappa and Bonzo Dog.
But not everything I have to say
about them is that negative. I am
ashamed to confess that there is
one track on the album which I like
and another one with an inch of
taste. It's no coincidence however
that the you'll have heard of
Walkin' on the sun, the track that
appears to have boosted the
band's career, (something had to).
Perhaps by luck, they have man-
aged to capture a highly catchy
tune with a riff that will stay in your
head for weeks to come. (They
even manage to get a smooth tone
on the guitar which is complement-
ed nicely with a high pitched ham-
mond when the chorus comes in).
The other track which I was talking
about was Push; the song launches
headlong into an instrumental intro
with hard, pounding drums fol-
lowed closely with a fast wah-wah
droned guitar. Unfortunately the
track goes downhill from here, sal-
vaged momentarily by a nifty little
lead break in the middle, which
seems to have influences in heavier
bands like Rage Against the
Machine.
But don't let me deter you.
There is a fair bit of swearing
throughout the album, with an
'explicit content' sticker on the
front, so they must be pretty cool!
Take my advice, buy the single if
you have to because you'll be
annoyed if you buy the whole
album. Don't say 1 didn't warn you!

SINGLES
Meredith Brooks - I Need
Essentially a shopping list set to music.
Reasonable girlie attitude and shouty chorus.
Not as good as her last single Bitch which is
remixed by Todd Terry on the B-sides.
Various - Perfect Day
Everyone's heard it, its just the same as on TV
but with all male and all female versions. It does
tell you who everyone is, though they should
have left out Gabrielle and the opera singers.
Lower - Life's Too Slow
Boring, whiny rubbish about which nothing con-
structive can really be said.
Breaker - Stereotype
Rather daft, angsty lyrics sung by an Alanis
Morrissette-ette. The second track, sinister min-
ister is somewhat Breeders-esque. The chorus
of Sinister Minister fails to be as forboding as it
was meant to be. Having said that it's really not
at all bad.
T H E E S S E N T I A L C H O O N
Baby Birkin - Melo Melo/Black...White
Melo Melo was written by (Serge?) Gainsbourg.
Funky hammond organ and Francais Lyricswith a
sixties detective show feel. Black...White could
have been done by minty during a fit of com-
merciality. Quirky but good.
The Dawn - 5 Days Wiser
Hackneyed Sound Garden-alikes. Five ugly
blokes with long hair playing at guitar Gods.
Nothing on this single hasn't been done before
by numerous more tallented and handsome
groups.
Paul Weller - Mermaids
Paul Weller's bland rock phase continues
unabaited. If you like all the other stuff he's
done recently then you'll like this. If not, you will
probably notice the remarkable similarity
between this and all his other recent material.
Mucho Macho - Rockley Sands
A 'couple of guitars and some drums' song with
the twist. The twist is that it's unspeakable rub-
bish. A twist that seems to be rather popular
amongst new bands these days. Repetitive,
uninspired trash.
Hoodwink - More Millionaires
A collecition of random noises and meaningless
lyrics. Barely music at all. As far as such things
go but its unlikely to make much of an impact on
the charts. L
