Footie Fourths Four Ever
CFC III v ICFC IV ICFC IV v Golds IV ICFC V v Holloway VI ICWAFC v RFH
his was no fluke; ask any player
'ram the Thirds who deserved to
win and albeit through gritted
teeth, they would have to say the
mighty IC Fourths.
After having scouted the thirds
and discovered their strengths and
weaknesses, Captain Quick
employed the revolutionary 4-4-2
formation thus preventing their
wing-backs from operating, leaving
them with no creative ideas. This
however wasn't a game for forma-
tions, it was about passion and
spirit, about who wanted the victo-
ry more. The defence (Paul, Andy,
Elliot, David) didn't put a foot
wrong all game, the midfield
(Ryan, Phaedon, Bola, Serge) and
Darren and Richard up front were
all magnificent. However, as
always special credit should be
given to the goal scorer, Darren,
bagging a quality brace, showing
the third's defenders what mup-
pets they really are. And also the
central midfield duo of Phaedon
and Bola totally dominated the
middle of the park, preventing the
Thirds from attacking and still cre-
ating chances for the strikers.
ICFC III 1 - 2 ICFC IV
Well, what can we say? The game
today was the crowning point of
our BUSA campaign so far. Our
jungle skills flowered under the-
grim sky as our first BUSA win
guaranteed us entry into the BUSA
knock-out shield. Specifically, the
touch of the elephant/lastadon
was not in our ranks today. Ryan,
Bola, Dazzla, Bertie and Elliot had
all been blessed with the skill of
the racoon, and our ever-solid
defence with the consistency of a
yak. The first goal was born - a
vivid, joyful combination terminat-
ed with a clinical finish.
The stamina of the mountain
billy-goat then set well in, replaced
at times with the stealth of the
leopard and the low cunning of the
fox. Our team surged forward like
a herd of buffalo and over-came
the Goldsmiths scum. And then
the second goal was created...
From there we held fast like a
baboon colony and waited patient-
ly for the final whistle, with
unshakable confidence. For the
record, both the goals were scored
by Elliot and thus the spirit of the
mongoose lives on.
ICAFC IV 2 0 Goldsmiths IV
Without doubt our worst perfor-
mance of the season so far We
started the game in confident
mood, keeping possession and
putting pressure on Holloway early
on. A sequence of corners very
nearly saw IC take the lead, with a
beautiful turn and shot by Dmitris
bringing out a fine save from the
opposition keeper. Andy C was
unlucky not to score after being put
through on goal on three separate
occasions as IC kept up the pace.
Unfortunately those early misses
were soon to be regretted as
Holloway won a corner and put in a
testing cross, which was headed in
by one of our own players.
A rethink during half time then
saw new boy Bic come on in mid-
field Again we started brightly with
Kublai forcing a good save with a
well directed header at goal. But an
inability to keep the ball for any
length of time soon led to Holloway
scoring again.
1C tried to raise the tempo, and
Dan's fluke 40 yard screamer
through the midfield, defence, and
keeper legs gave us hope with fifteen
minutes to go. But it wasn't to be.
ICAFC V I - 2 Holloway VI
Rapture for Rugby
IC I v St George I IC II v St George II ICIII v St Mary's I
Possibly the best performance of
the season saw the IC dragon slay
St George! The opening try began
under our own posts and went the
full 101 metres - "le Telfor" was
showing off! After "Hog's
breath's" interception and fine
break, Ali "Taff" Jefferies showed
his immaculate kicking skills by hit-
ting the post with the conversion,
after champagne rugby (England,
are you watching?) mainly by the
"miners", the ball swept smoothly
from hand to hand with "Buffy"
Buttenshaw putting "Mongol"
Lloyd away for a well worked try.
Yep, Ali missed the conversion.
Lionel scored the decisive try. The
back row were more rampant than
herpes and Dan "I'll kick you and
run away" Higasi won man of the
match for infecting them more
than the others.
ICRFC I 17 - 5 St George's I
The purple helmets still pissed
and somethingover from the night
before descended on St George's
with a wrath of great vengeance
then delivered them from their
great pain and suffering.
Spuw Tanoy having chundered
before the game twice decided to
be a back this week and actually
managed to receive 'some' ball
from El Capitan (crash fly-half) to
run some niftey little waddles of
his fat arse!
Matt Faggoty managed to
score a try (Surprise) which was
commendable.
Dim Slim Tim (sounds like a
Chinese dish?) scored a try after
many wain attempts to get the ball
to him.
It was scrappy but we wanted
it and the win was well deserved.
ICURFC II 15 - 0 St George's II
This game was fought mainly up
front with both sets of fat boys
trying to gain the upper gut. We
had the weight, but they had the
speed and height. They scored
two quick tries before we woke
up and joined the fray. A superb
solo try from James 'Quicksilver'
Welsh was converted by Chris
'Golden Boot' Dickenson.
Despite tactics remeniscent of
the All-Blacks even the defensive
efforts of Tom 'Offside' Hovard
could not keep the Medics out,
after losing our glorious captain
Julian 'Logic' Harrison RIP.
In the second half, having
then lost Kolone 'What half is it'
Yung, we were down to fourteen
men.
We played some of the best
rugby of our season but the ref
was a baxxxxd.
ICRFC III 7 - 31 St Mary's III
It was quickly evident that the
Royal Free were of a lower class to
us, so it was only a matter of time
until we scored. A rather impres-
sive individual effort by Brindley
saw our first notch on the goal
post. This was soon followed by a
superb strike from Taffy, who at
last realised which team she was
supposed to score for.
The first goal in the second half
followed a scramble in the box and
then a simple chip into the top
corner. Next was a more classy
effort - Freud played a beautiful
cross in from the right which was
met with precision by Scrubber.
Brindley then completed her
Brace with a penalty after one of
the Free defenders blatantly han-
dled the ball in the box, lest she
should spoil her make-up by head-
ing the ball. Scrubber's hat-trick
was a long time coming - She took
on two defenders and then wrong-
footed the keeper after being
booted in the shin for the
umpteenth time.
The defence was little troubled
and the only exciting thing to hap-
pen to keeper Langrish was when a
bird excreted on her shoe (those
Free players really should control
their bowel movements) Scrubber
turned down Hedge's offer of pint
or two to celebrate the hat-trick "1
swear I'm off alcohol for life"
ICWAFC 6- ROYAL FREE 0
ICFC I v UMDS I
IC produced a dire performance
which the Duke of Prague would
be truly ashamed of. The captain
has to take a lot of the blame for
this defeat as he was sent off after
ten minutes when IC were leading
1 - 0. The offence was "ungentle-
manly conduct" or to be more pre-
cise flashing his awoken (by a
Scrubber) manhood at the referee.
His action is now being considered
by a ULU disciplinary committee
and the captain looks set for a
lengthy ban - perhaps unfair for
such a 'small offence'.
After the game our spirits
weren't lifted by any of our team
pulling, since we are just plain ugly
- only women footballers would go
for us. What can we do? Become
rugby players?
ICFC 1 1 - 5 UMDS I
