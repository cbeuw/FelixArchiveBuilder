Anyone interested?

Orienteering Chess Guns
Given the chance of two events
within fifteen hours, ICUOC could
not refuse. On a wet and windy
Saturday evening we braved
Therfield common in Royston to
do a night event. David Nutt man-
aged to come second on the
toughest course despite not hav-
ing orienteered since July. The rest
of us were beaten by Cambridge
on the v
Navy' course although
Jacob Sharpe got sixth place with a
very good time of 46:29, just one
second behind the fifth placed
Cambridge runner. Despite being
responsible for buying the batteries
for the lamps Gareth Jones's bat-
tery ran out before the finish in a
repeat of the Southern Night
Champs the previous week, but he
was able to finish by using the
lights of a nearby Rugby club to
read the map.
Next, at Ashbridge, those of us
who had been at Therfield felt the
effects but Jacob Sharpe had
another good run, finishing 25th
with a time of 67:32 minutes. Ola
Holmer finished the 'brown'
course in 80:05 minutes - two
minutes under par time.

The Chess II team, glowing with
three wins from four matches this
term, were trounced by a strong
side from Hackney in the
Middlesex League last week. In the
absence of star players Jeremy
Davies and Rob Kruszynski, last
season's impressive win at home
was not repeated.
At the "late" start time of
7.30pm only three of our eight
players were at their boards - the
match looked lost without a move
having been played. Dave Tang
had to be dragged away from a
friendly "warm-up" game next
door. Others arrived one by one
within the half-hour default time.
lvo Tzenov lost too quickly on
board 8. His opponent belched
and smoked and almost died of
coughing, but unfortunately lived
to deliver checkmate.
A fire alarm interrupted the
match - a welcome break for
some, and maybe the opposition
would be cheesed off by it (of
course, we're used to it now).
Andy Slough resumed his game
with a rotten move, and slipped
from a dominating position into a
loss. Dave had also been better
off, having played quickly (his
forte) and swapped off pieces, but
he failed to turn it into a win.
Jeremy didn't appear, so Giles
'squirrel' Cope was substituted on
board 4. More at home with
bridge, he was slowly and method-
ically crushed. Even his combat
boots and trousers, pint of beer,
and an aggressive squat on the
chair couldn't save him. Kostas
Vafiadis was not on form and lost
to a stormy attack on his king,
unsuccessfully sheltering behind
rickety pawns.
Tim Douglas continued to per-
form brilliantly and pulled off our
only win with a mating attack on
the castled king. Barry Gale faced
the same opponent as last year;
having survived the opening with a
reasonable postion as black, he
foolishly allowed thrusting pawns
to creep up on his deserted king,
and soon found himself in a mating
trap.
Simon Warman requested the
challenge of playing a tough oppo-
nent on board 1. He showed him-
self up to the task and lasted to a
very drawish endgame. However,
he entered the "speed finish" a
couple of minutes down and,
unwilling to accelerate his thinking
processes, he lost on time.
The final score was 1.5 - 6.5,
our worst defeat so far.
The Islamic Society
events have started off with a
bang, or I should I say 'splat!' Our
annual paint balling event saw us
this year pitted against the shoot-
ing skills of City University. Played
on a thirty acre site we had an
action packed day, with every one
suited out in a combat suit and a
semi automatic paint gun. The
event including four main games,
each lasting forty minutes was held
at the 'Big Red' in Slough.
Imperial got off to an impres-
sive start in game one, the objec-
tive to take the opponents flag and
defend our own. After thirty five
minutes both sides were locked in
an endless stalemate with little
casualties. Then with two minutes
to spare 'VP Areeb' ( our vice pres-
ident ) made a suicide rush at the
City base and single handily took
their flag and made his way back to
give Imperial a twenty point lead.
Mission accomplished but mainly
because the City's defence had run
out of paint bullets. Game two -
'defence of the village'- saw each
side try to defend a village and
stop the enemy stealing your flag.
Both sides defended the village
and the game was declared a
draw, thanks mainly to the sharp
defensive shooting of Imperials
'ewoks' Ishtiaq and $aqib.
After a break for prayer and a
much needed hot meal, game four
- 'speed ball.' Like game one the
objective was to the take the ene-
mies flag and protect your own,
but this time it was a quick fire
mad rush of four, three minute
games.
In game one our favourite sec-
retary himself, 'hitman' Harris, was
the only Imperial man left alive.
He ran the whole length of the
field, took out the remaining three
City players in amazing manoeuvre
and walked back with City's flag.
City won the next two but fresher
Rizwan maintained our lead by
winning the last game with a great
individual effort.
City fought back trailing only by
five points, by defeating Imperials
attempt in game four to 'defend
the bridge.' With both sides cheat-
ing in our attempt to take City's
bridge ( thanks to our 'shifty'
fresher Hussan) the last game was
called a draw and we won the
event by five points. If anyone is
interested in future paint balling
events please email the Islamic
Society at h.bokhari@ic.ac.uk.
