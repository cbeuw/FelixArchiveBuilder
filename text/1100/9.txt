28 November 1997 COLUMNS
There are few shared experi-
ences at Imperial. Lectures and
tutorials pass by some of our num-
ber. As for the opposite sex, need
I say more? However, one thing
unites us all. The false alarm. Who
can have failed to be repeatedly
inconvenienced by the fire alarm
going off without good reason.
Under normal circumstances this
would be in the 'dog bites man'
class of news worthiness, but of
late there seems to have been a
distinct increase. Southside had
three in one evening recently.
Chemistry, my own department,
has more fire alarms in a week
than could reasonably be expected
in a decade. Needless to say, they
always occur at the most inoppor-
tune moment, causing tremen-
dous disruption, annoyance and,
at this time of year, hypothermia.
It is amazing how many people in
College still bother with evacua-
tions, given that they are occur-
ring, sometimes, on a daily basis.
Why is the system so unreliable?
Lack of money? Sloppy mainte-
nance? In my own case, the last
false alarm was caused by the lat-
ter, but generally it is difficult to
say. There is no shortage of
money; fire systems, like office
refurbishments, are deemed
essential expenditure, so the
money can always be found. Last
year, £167,000 was spent on
improvements and replacements
to the system and
since Estates
have about
£5million per year
for maintenance,
cash can be
found. Sadly, as
with so many
things here, it will
take a major inci-
dent, where casu-
alties stem from
ignorance of the
alarm or its failure
to go off at all, to
change things. The consequences
of this happening in a hall of resi-
dence are bad enough, but in a
chemisty department, it is terrify-
ing. Liability in such cases rests
with the most senior manager
aware of the problem. Sutite Five
take note...

In this game, words can often
be twisted. People sometimes
read my column, get the wrong
end of the stick and become fright-
fully excited, firing off threats like a
tinpot dictator. The Hockey Club.
For reasons that totally escape me,
this fine body of
men gained the
impression from
one of my arti-
cles last year
that I did not
respect their
achievements.
Worse still, they
s o m e h o w
believe that I
frown on the
use of ' bar
^ j n a m e s . '
G e n t l e m e n ,
nothing could be further from the
truth. In my formative years, many
moons ago, I used to do battle
with stick and ball, scoring, if
memory serves, two goals in my
swansong game. My affection for
thie game has never diminished.
Bar names add colour to the
reports of their heroic efforts, and
I was genuinely moved when I
heard that my own name has
become the basis of one such
moniker. How Indian Carpet
Catalogue and his merry band of
hockeyists can possibly think I am
opposed to this is is a mystery.
Was ever a man more misunder-
stood?
Finally, virtutally every one of
you should now be aware of the
excellent Xerox Docucentre on the
walkway, or so it seemed to any-
one queueing for their services on
the recent opening day. Amusing
and libelouts t-shirts and mouse-
mats were being produced at a
frightening rate, along with, I fear,
a huge loss on the day.
Nevertheless, the staff did a ster-
ling job and seem set for a bright
future here. I blamed Mike Hansen
for the fiasco of their predeces-
sors, so it seems appropriate to
congratulate him for getting in this
first class outfit.
Help us spend £4 million a day...
Over the next ten years Railtrack will be spending £16 billion on 20,000 miles of track
and infrastructure. For the right graduates, there's a lot of career mileage in investment
on that scale.
