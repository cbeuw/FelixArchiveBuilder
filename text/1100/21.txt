» m we're new to London and
\ i\ / it's a big city with many
V V theatres. We got lost.
So. we're riot quite sure what
happens in the first half hour of
Popular Mechanicals. To be honest,
we were quire glad of our mistake
because at this point the comedy
was a little strained: Reminiscent
perhaps of an over-done school
assembly with at least five minutes
of bottom jokes. However, we
could see that rhe cast, comprising
of: Lisa Kelly. Dean Lennox Kelly,
Cal McCrystal, Keith Robinson.
Devon Scott and Simon Walter,
were comfortable with their parts
and the overall effect of the cos-
tumes and the scenery was first-
class.
Based on A Midsummer
Nighr's Dream, Popular
Mechanicals maintains the themes
of madness, enchantment and
imagination but concentrates on
the ridiculous Mechanicals and, as
Rebecca Wolman
A
ngels and demons is an
intriguing play that presents
an intricate account of the
battle between good and evil with-
in the human soul through humor-
ous and uplifting tales.
The audience is first introduced
to the Shekhinah, the Princess of
Light who once angers the King so
greatly that his anger causes her to
disappear in flash of light. Years
later, the King, unable to locate the
Princess calls on all the Princes of
the world to search for his daugh-
ter, promising that he would give
his daughter's hand in marriage. It
is not until much later in the play
that the story of the lost Princess is
revived and in fact this opening tale
serves as an awkward finale to the
play. The key to understanding the
idea of the Shekhinah lies in the
realisation that the King represents
God and the Princess of Light sym-
bolises God's presence in the
world.
But with light comes darkness
and in the second scene Lilith is
presented through a profound and
thought provoking interpretation of
Genesis; It would appear that in the
garden of Eden, God created two
women. The playwright describes
the first woman as Lilith, the name

admirable if misguided aspirations
to perform beyond their true capa-
In real life however, the cast
were incredibly perceptive, with a
wide array of facial expressions
The lively start to the second
half began to change our opinion
of the play. From here, the perfor-
mance broke up into a series of
sketches, linked by rhe original
theme. Dean Lennox Kelly. In his
role of 'Snug the Joiner' kicked it
off with a satirical stand-up show
including his impression of Sir
Walter Riiey in Al Paccino
style..."Art thou talking to me?" And
here's a good one to tell you:
friends "What do Simon the
pieman and Alfred the Great have
in common? The!' Maybe you
had to be there?
The highlight of the evening
was a puppet dance routine with
given to her by Jewish legend
(Midrash). Created equal to Adam
she refused to "lie below" him and
their relationship did not last long
as neither listened to the other. In
anger and frustration, Lilith pro-
nounced the secret ineffable name
of God and disappeared into the air
becoming a vengeful demon and
alluring seductress, equal of Adam.
The play proceeds as a compi-
lation of tales told by two actors
and two multi-instrumented musi-
cians. This small cast takes the
audience on an enchanting journey
through a wealth of legends and
tales that explore the angels and
demons that influence our moral
decisions. The tale of Azazel, an
angel who betrays God by attempt-
ing to marry a beautiful Princess is
a key tale to which other tales are
related. Azazel is clearly meant to
symbolise the devil and like Lilith is
one of the omnipresent demons
that we must contend with.
This play, though fragmented at
times, manages to embroid a
diverse range of cultural and bibli-
cal tales. The tale of the Princess of
light in the prologue is an adapta-
tion of a 1 3th Century Spanish tale
and other tales in the play stem
from Moroccan and Tunisian oral
rubber Tudor chickens. On sticks.
Although the play vaguely stuck
to the storyline of the original
Shakespeare. It now began to
explore "classic" theatre and its
associated quirks. The director's
experience of re-created
Elizabethan theatre was apparent in
the clownish jigs and ditties. At the
same time the props became more
bizarre - watch out lor the irons I
and modern language can be a lit-
tle confusing. The script is also
unnecessarily coarse in places so
don't take your gran. We would
definitely recommend the second
hall to all you budding artistes. If
you do go and manage to catch
the beginning, could you drop us a

traditions as well as others form
eastern European folk tales, all
cleverly blended with inspired con-
temporary tales from the play-
wright herself.
The stage has no curtains and is
completely open which helps to
emphasise the clever and original
use of props. Hanging rope ladders
are used to great effect and the
two actors Simon Thorp and Emma
Cater are very gymnastic in their
acting and play multiple roles very
effectively which makes the play
both dramatic and dynamic. The
drama is further strengthened by
two excellent instrumentalists
whose music is very well synchro-
nised with the changing moods as
the tales oscillate between good
and evil, light and dark, angels and
demons.
Overall this is a very interesting,
humorous and thought provoking
play but we were both disappoint-
ed by the ending which we felt was
uninspiring.

W
hat can I write about
this exhibition? I could
say that the pho-
tographs and the video screens
portray the dissatisfaction with
society, the nihilistic feeling so
dominant in our pre-millennium,
angst-ridden culture. I could
also say that the sensitive juxta-
position of the old visual medi-
um of photography.with the rela-
tive novelty of the video nation
exemplifies the abandonment of
staid traditions, and the
embrace of a newer, more radi-
cal approach to art. However,
this is Felix, not i-D magazine, so
I won't. I'll say what I think. I
thought that this was awful, real-
ly, really bad. At the risk of
repeating my editor's article on
contemporary art, I would like to
say how disillusioned and dis-
gusted I am by the state of art in
Britain. Nowadays, you only
have to state that you're an
artist, and everything you do is
automatically regarded as valid
art. If I'd been to art college, col-
lected a degree and become an
artist, 1 could place 22 baked
bean cans on a brick, and call it
"nosTalgia", and maybe I'd win
the Turner Prize. Alternately, I
could chop up three man-
nequins, insert a cucumber, two
melons and a kumquat, and call
it "ProstitutioN". For goodness
sake, this exhibition is awful,
pretentious rubbish. Don't go.
