No doubt you've seen
the film, but this game
has been a long time
coming. However 1 feel
it was probably worth the wait as it
is probably only now that comput-
ers have the power to do justice to
a film of this stature. The game isn't
based on the story-line or charac-
ters from the film, but is set in the
same futuristic, dark, post apoca-
lyptic world. The atmosphere cre-
ated by the director in the film has
been acclaimed and 1 think that the
game has done an excellent job of
mimicking this.
It's an adventure or rather a
detective style game. A bit like
Under a Killing Moon, or the very
ancient Mean Streets. In fact it
bares a great resemblance to
Mean Streets indeed; the way you
collect clues, move about the city
in you flying car and the little bit of
action thrown in. This action 1 men-
tioned is shooting enemies or sus-
pects in a sort of mouse controlled
Virtua Cop style walk-through sce-
nario. The graphics however are
very advanced. Their quality is
almost film like yet unlike the inter-
active movie style game you have
complete control of your character,
Ray McCoy. His movements are
very realistic and you would think it
had all been filmed but no it is
computer generated.
The story is that you are, like
Deckard (Harrison Ford) was
before you, a Blade Runner, given
the task of hunting down rogue
replicants. There is a fairly grue-
some cut-scene of a crime (animal
murder!) and that's where your
investigation starts. That scene and
with other numerous gory movie
sequencies the game has been
honoured with a 15 certificate. The
gore is effective and this is a good
thing as although it isn't done to
over effect, like ultra gory games, it
is a refreshingly moody, dark and
sinister game.
It quickly becomes apparent
that replicants have or are playing a
major part in the crime and the plot
unfolds from there. As it was, I
barely scratched the surface of this
massive game, contained on 4 cd-
roms. Must be at least played, if
not bought. 1
