WORLD AIDS DAY
HITS COLLEGE
World AIDS day takes place on
Monday 1st December and is
being marked by stalls set up by
the Welfare committee, and a
charity party on Thursday 4
December, organised by Imperial
Queers, IC's lesbian, gay and
bisexual society.
The stalls will have informa-
tion and red ribbons for sale (in
aid of Mildmay Hospital, London).
There will also be available
Terrence Higgins Trust Christmas
cards in the Union building,
Sherfield, and all the medical
schools from l l a m - 3 p m on
Monday.
The IQ disco will take place in
dB's from 7.30 onwards, with a
70's theme. Kevin Butcher and
Steve Cook from IQ both stressed
that the event is open to all: "gay,
straight, whatever", especially as
they point out that HIV and AIDS
are not exclusively gay problems:
"it effects us all". The door charge
of £2 will go towards the Terrence
Higgins Trust. The event has also
been advertised through the other
London Gay and Lesbian
Societies. The ICU minibus service
will also be running from the
event.
St Mary's have also organised
a talk from an AIDS victim in
Gladys, the Union Bar, at 1 pm on
1 December.

BIG IDEAS FROM
DOCUCENTRE
After the well publicised receiver-
ship of ABA Holdings in April (Felix
1085), there now comes a more
comprehensive replacement in
the form of the Docucentre.
Launched on the 18 of this
month, the Docucentre claims to
offer a wider range of services
than the photocopying service
provided by its predecessors.
The Docucentre, from Xerox
Business Services, says that it will
provide collating, full colour
images from disks, laminating and
even translation of English docu-
ments into other languages as
well as the standard photocopy-
ing. The centre is available to stu-
dents and staff requests alike and
have already set up bulk orders
with the Department Of
Materials. Job requests to the
centre can be transferred by disk,
hard copy and soon via the col-
lege network. It is situated just
off the Walkway, opposite the
climbing wall.

CHEMISTRY
C O M M O N ROOM
CLOSURE
The only undergraduate common
room within the Chemistry
department has been re-allocated
as postgraduate office space. This
move by the department has
annoyed many students, neither
staff or students having been con-
sulted. Their only compensation
being take-away only access to
the snack-bar in the postgraduate
common room.
The Chemistry department is
now one of the few departments
that is unable to provide specific
recreational facilities for their
undergraduates. Dr Goodgame,
the department's college tutor
explained that the Common
Room was an "under-utilised"
resource, and in a time where
space is at a premium within the
department, it was not a cause
worth fighting for.
In contrast, Ed Walker,
Chemistry's RCSU Department
Representative, saw the facility as
a necessary part of college life
and depicted the whole operation
as the "withdrawal of the last
social space for undergraduates".
He objected to the reticent man-
ner in which the undertaking had
been carried out, referring to a
recent RCSU meeting where it
became apparent that staff as
well as students were oblivious to
the conversion.
The postgraduates are indif-
ferent to the undergraduate inva-
sion of their common room.

New Supercomputer
BY ANDREW OFORI
IC students now have the excep-
tional opportunity to use some of
the most powerful parallel com-
puting equipment in Europe. The
Department of Computing now
boasts the Fujitsu AP3000, along
with a Fujitsu VX vector proces-
sor. It is an upgrade of the
API000 which was donated to
the college by Fujitsu in 1994.
The college received an award
of £1.65 million as a result of the
proposal it entered in a competi-
tion run by the Engineering and
Physical Sciences Research Council
and the Higher Education Funding
Council. This, in conjunction with
support from Fujitsu enabled the
acquisition of the new equipment,
which was unveiled on Comm-
emoration Day.
The 80 node AP3000 has 12.5
gigabytes of memory, 336 giga-
bytes of internal disk and has a the-
oretical peak performance of 45.6
gigaflops (compared with the 1 -2
gigaflops of the AP1000). The sys-
tem is placed on a high-speed net-
work and brings with it a sophisti-
cated priority scheduling system,
to enable the equipment to effi-
ciently deal with numerous
research projects concurrently. Its
applications in modelling/ simula-
tion alone can be applied to almost
every department within the col-
lege.
This machine, which hails from
the new generation of supercom-
puter, enhances IC's position in
top-line European research. Unlike
the AP 1000 which is open to gen-
eral use, the AP3000 is only avail-
able for college use. In order to
use it a proposal satisfying the par-
allel computing centre's (ICPC) cri-
teria must be submitted.
Those brave and able enough
to utilise the AP3000 can make ini-
tial enquiries to the following e-
