uniqueness of the Man, the best
creature made by God, was burnt
alive in Rome. The century after saw
the birth of the Age of the Reason
and Enlightenment. During the
French Revolution, the citizens of
Paris destroyed statues of saints and
angels and instead placed statues of
the "Goddess of Reason". Last cen-
tury, Giosue' Carducci, an Italian
poet, wrote "Inno a Satana " (Hymn
to Satan), in which he spoke about
reason, progress, modernity and the
need to live in the world thinking
about the world and not about
Heaven; the importance of what is
imminent, not what is transcendent.
Much has been said about the
birth of Science, but not many
people know the hidden relations
which existed between science,
magic and even the philosophy of
Satanism. Let us understand what
really happened in those dark ages
when scientists, magicians and
astrologers belonged to the same cat-
egory. Until 1600, there was what is
called a "triangular knowledge
process" where men were forbidden
to understand the world with their
reason; they had to refer to the Holy
Bible to know what was around
them. Through the Middle Ages, the
Roman Catholic Church adopted a
model of the Universe based on
Aristotle's ideas, revised and cor-
rected by St. Thomas,
Holy Doctor of the / / ( . . . .
Church. This model

purest ether, and the whole Solar
System, including the Sun, spun
around our planet. Outside this \\
tern there was heaven and God, j a r
rounded by angels. But in the seven-
teenth century, Galileo Galilei, the
Italian scientist, used binoculars lor
the first time to observe the sky.
That night, on the lop floor of a
small villa in Pisa near Florence, the
story was going to change. How-

valleys on the Moon! Where was the
pure ether? And what about tne four
little satellites orbiting around
Jupiter, so similar to the Moon and
to the other planets? That night, the
so-called "triangular knowledge
process" was broken: men tried to
understand the world using only
their reason, not the Bible. And, in i
doing that, Galileo rebelled against
the Holy Church, like Lucifer did
against God. In fact, the basis of the
philosophy of Satanism is that man
is able to look after his life without
the help of God. The consequences
of this rebellion were swift: the Holy
Inquisition arrested him and all the
other brave scientists who followed
him. Galileo was imprisoned, tor-
tured and forced to say that what he
had seen was merely dust on the
lenses of his binoculars, and that the
Universe was as Aristotle had
described it. Giordano Bruno, who

the power td send roi'lets to other
planets, to save millions of lives
with a vaccine and to destroy mil-
lions of lives with H-Bombs. It is
the power to create a child by just
using two invisible cells, I he power
to design that child as we do with a
car, by using genetic engineering, to
duplicate that child as we do with
word when we use COPY and
PASTE on our word-processor. Even
more nightmarish projects can be
realised in the future; some people
say that it is possible to transfer the
whole personality of a human into a
computer programme. Then humans
will be able to live on in a computer
after their bodies die. After all, it is
just a matter of reproducing the nor-
mal electrical currents present inside
a human brain on complex silicon-
based chips. Personality, memories,
behaviour and whatever a human
soul is, are not more than immensely
complex interactions amongst bil-
lions of neurons. But who can state
that men will never be able to under-
stand this complexity?
If these ideas seem to
close to science-fiction,
we should remember that
now we can connect the
little brains of some little
bugs to a small
microchips, and scientists
can control the movements
of these living insects using a simple
remote-controllers, as if these living
creatures were micro-models. Is it
only the overflowing wit of humans,
or are we now going too far?
Now that we are close to the year
2000, millennial movements are
forming and growing stronger and
stronger. Like in an agreement with
the Devil, man gained huge power
through science. But in any agree-
ment with the Devil, there is a
moment at which a price must be
paid. How close have we been to the
end of our civilization? Imagine if
an atomic war had occurred during
