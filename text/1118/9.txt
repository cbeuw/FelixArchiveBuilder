o, I'm seventeen again, reel-
ing from t o o m u c h alcohol,
too many bodies pressing
close to m e , sweat dripping into
my eyes. Trying to work out this
'dancing' lark, throwing myself into
shapes that cause a concerned
passer-by to enquire if I'm having a
seizure. D e c i d e to turn in m y
recently acquired dancing shoes
and take u p knitting instead. A n d
then, a n d then.... The Only Rhyme
That Bites. Cheesy western sample
(dunno w h i c h o n e , don't care)
pulling a rictus grin around m y
face, feet finally achieving s o m e
level of synchrony, the b o y
becomes a g o d . A t least, that's
how I remember it.
Without wallowing in nostalgia
too m u c h , 808:98 is a timely
reminder of just h o w bloody g o o d
8 0 8 State were. While sweeping
through musical boundaries like
they were Swiss border check-
points, they still managed to pro-
duce a succession of floor-fillers
that everyone loved. Cubik, with its
angular melody and clipped beats
is pure techno class while Olympic
eases your head open a n d smoth-
ers the synapses in Golden Syrup.
O f course, their point is not that
they're back to rehash the old hits,
but to prove that they never really
went away, as the latter half of the
album confirms.
A plethora of collaborations are
present, from the laid-back Lopez
(with james Dean Bradfield) to the
predictably daft Bjork outing,
Ooops. Particularly g o o d is Azura,
which features the s w o o n s o m e
vocal talents of Louise Rhodes
from Lamb, although it's not quite
up to the standard of her regular
outfit. O n e does get the impres-
sion of them cashing in o n the
cachet associated with being pio-
neers of a genre which has ulti-
mately m o v e d o n sufficiently to
render 8 0 8 State s o m e w h a t
obsolete.
But this matters little when pre-
sented with In Yer Face (which is),
and Pacific State, featuring the
most memorable oboe riff ever.
Who cares if they're still 'relevant'
when they've got a string of such
unarguably brilliant tunes to their
name.
Now, where d i d I put those
white gloves? Aaaah, sorted. CI

A
little k n o w n fact about
H e a d s w i m is that they start-
ed life as a dodgy metal out-
fit complete with long hair and tight
trousers. What happened, then, t o
initiate such a drastic change of
music a n d style? Well in the words
of vocalist Daniel Glendining ' w e
wrote s o m e songs'. The songs in
question are all packed with a raw
emotion not heard of since the
likes of Radiohead, w h o are obvi-
ous influences. The t w o singles so
far, Tourniquet a n d Better Made,
were strangely ignored by the sin-
gles buying public, both only briefly
gracing the bottom e n d of the t o p
forty. This a l b u m definitely
deserves to d o better.
H e a d s w i m are a m o n g s t the
new set of bands touting misery as
the m o o d of the late nineties, a
wonderful refreshing feeling for
those of us w h o occasionally feel
like punching lan Broudie in the
face.
The power in the music c o m e s
from a combination of the extraor-
dinary voice of Daniel Glendining
(sounding similar to Sting, only bet-
ter) and the harsh but ultimately
beautiful, melodious guitaring cour-
tesy of Daniel a n d the strangely
monikered Clovis Taylor.
The album is populated by a
series of dark haunting songs each
one reflecting various aspects of
d e p r e s s i o n ; Wishing I was Naive an
emotion I think w e all have some-
times; Clinging to the Wreckage
a n d the achingly brilliant finale
Brother as well as the aforemen-
tioned singles are definite stand
out tracks, each one dripping with
passion. Interestingly it is the more
upbeat tracks which fail to strike a
chord, namely Holy Ghost. This is
the only bad track o n the album
which flies by a n d leaves little
impression.
This really is an absolutely
superb debut album w h i c h will
hopefully cause Joe public to wake
up, smell the roses a n d s e n d
H e a d s w i m to the stardom they
deserve. H e a d s w i m are the perfect
antidote for those w h o have tired
of OK Computer and desperately
need another dose of depression
to remind them of just how bad this
term can get.
Finally I'd like to thank Dave
Hellard for consistently handing his
reviews in late a n d therefore for-
feiting this album. Cheers Dave. CI

irst there w a s A s h , then
S y m p o s i u m a n d now Midget.
Here w e have another typi-
cally cheeky a n d chirpy indie
band, following the footsteps of
many before them. Midget, a
band m a d e up of three pre-pubes-
cent teenagers have brought forth
their debut album, but have y o u
heard of them? Surprising if not,
as during the last year they've
managed to put out around seven
singles.
Their latest single, The Day Of
Your Life is set to hit the charts
with the force of a marshmallow,
but it's not b a d . It's just that
M i d g e t are fighting for a hole in
the market that is barely visible.
Like their peers, M i d g e t s e e m to
have t w o m o d e s . Loud and pacey
or acoustic a n d cheeky. This con-
trast can clearly be seen in the t w o
best songs of the album, The One
Who Could Save Me a n d Canada.
Canada rips through the verses
c o m i n g to a climax before slowing
d o w n to a chorus delivered with
the softness of the lead singer of
Catch. They try to tell y o u that
they're y o u n g a n d out for a laugh,
their lyrics talking of unimportant
things such as alcopops and invis-
ible balloons.
You can't really fault the album
for musical content, except for
lack of originality. They have the
'we're y o u n g a n d want to m o s h '
m o o d s of S y m p o s i u m , combined
with the quirky a n d youthful
approach of Catch. H a d they
e m e r g e d t w o years ago, they
would have been seen as fresh,
but unfortunately they haven't, so
all they can rely upon is that the
youth of today have the money
and time to follow one more band
like this. CI David H
