Easter also \ 1 71 x '
saw the release Wlicit S
of Aretha
Franklin's set, after a huge hiatus
the original q u e e n of soul has
returned and in what style. The
album name A Rose is Still A Rose
is quite fitting since this lady can
still claim to be amongst the best, if
not the best. The title track from
the album is the killer cut, but the
rest is still a class
act.
During Easter
the Gangstarr
album Moment o,
Truth d r o p p e d
Before its release
most were chattin'
about this as the
hip h o p set of the
year and after part-
ing with my hard
earned cash I gotta say they
weren't wrong. This album is gonna
feature in the top five of everyone's
hip hop hit list of that I have no
doubt, my favourite tune is the
stunning Royalty, featuring K - C i
and Jojo from Jodeci; DJ Premier
lays d o w n a wicked melody, Jodeci
boys d o their thing and Guru, well
Guru does what he does best.
Royalty hasn't got a release date
yet, but w h e n it does y o u better
recognize, cause Gangstarr are the
kings. If y o u w a n n a check
Gangstarr for yourself they are
c o m i n g to England as support for A
Tribe Called Quest o n July 16th.
, . . . The Tribe are
Up Y c\ll! c o m i n g to give
support for their
new album A Love Moment due
out on 14 July.
Public Enemy (remember
them?) haven't released an album
for some time, and suddenly were
getting two in one year as far
as I'm concerned it's all g o o d ! The
first release strictly speaking isn't a
PE a l b u m . Rather,
the soundtrack to
the Spike Lee film
He Cot Came, but
seeing as all the
tracks are by Public
Enemy 1 think it
rates as a PE album.
Personally I've only
caught one cut from
it, the title track He
Got Game and boy
this is head nodding infectious as
hell - this is a tune! The rest of the
album I'm told kicks it equally hard
and features many guest appear-
ances, most notably from ICRS-1.
PE's second release for the year will
be their album (as o p p o s e d to the
soundtrack which has PE on every
track but isn't a really a PE album)
called Resurrection. I haven't heard
a thing about it or from it and don't
really know what to say, so I'm not
gonna say shit.
O n the future album front, a
new album is due from Maxwell
called Embrya, after the first this
has alot to live up to. R. Kelly has
Kenny driving a Union minibus (he's under the dog in a "I was con-
trolling the pedals" position). Allegedly.
THA BOMB I
Yeah, yeah we back, its back, after
weeks of chillin' 1 thought it about
time to hit ya with a dose of Tha
Bomb and bring everyone back up
to date with all the happenings in
the world of street soul.
I said fire it up! The Easter break
was huge for Busta, the Knight
Rider sampling Fire It Up d i d s o m e
serious damage in the top half of
the top ten. Busta was flavour of
the month appeared on numerous
shows including Top of the Pops
and, strangely, TFI Friday. Then the
boy went to The T e m p l e in
Tottenham and ripped the place
up. People w h o were there say
that W e s t w o o d ' s place will never
see a show like that again.
I said fire it up. A n d Canibus
and LL are doing just that, its o n !
The beef started w h e n LL changed
Canibus's verse on 4,3,2,1 and
added a cuss o n Canibus into his
own verse. Canibus didn't sit back,
this boy bit back and ripped LL to
shreds with the banging 2nd Round
Knockout, but LL got off the canvas
and has c o m e back with his retala-
tion cut The Ripper Strikes Back. In
Ripper LL has a go at Canibus and
Wyclef (reportedly the new manag-
er of Canibus), cussing the latter
was probably a mistake 'cos n o w
he has both gunning for him and
Wyclef has just finished his retalia-
tion cut What 'Clef Got to Do With
It?. Winner? LL's got history, but
Canibus is the rawest rapper
around, he got the skillz.

Well as this year draws (on a
joint) to an end, I think it is only fit-
ting that we congratulate in a mutu-
al brown nosathon all those w h o
have helped to transform the sta-
tion into one which kicks more butt
than Beavis' foot.
Respect goes out to Jon Crabb
for making this page (he's a w a s p
and salivates paper ... really), Ross
for getting DJ Hurricane in the stu-
dios, John C for all the gigs, Gareth
for painting the Back R o o m a deep
lilac, Neel for using the recording
studio m o r e than ever before,
Kenny for being amusing and to the
rest of the crew not forgetting the
Dj's and our lively audience!
G o o d luck to next year's c o m -
mittee w h o will make ICR bounce
further than Zebedee giving Tigger
a piggy-back whilst being p r o d d e d
where it hurts with an IC Radio
branding iron (cheers Chef).
This week's highlights are the
return of N e l s o n Frisbee and
Spencer Wriggly after a brief inter-
lude in the Andes breeding with
Pink Pandas (you should see the
photographs). Their show will bring
you up on an illegal high of wit to
feather dust away those revision
blues. Tune in M o n d a y s , l 2 - 2 p m
for some light relief.
DJ Pugwash and Peter Terry will
be continuing their tradition of giv-
ing away far too many cinema tick-
ets for Warner Village every week,
as well as playing world exclusive
remixes in their unique pir8 style
show. Listen up on Wednesdays
between 6 and 8 to W I N W I N W I N !

hard at work o n material for
a certain M . Jackson.
This week's single releases see
some of the biggest names in hip
hop and RnB releasing top tunes,

tell y a all about it next week. Shout
outs to all those w h o matter!
