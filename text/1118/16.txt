HELD IN SUSPENSE
ARTS 5 June 1998
A CHORUS OF DISAPPROVAL
Alan Ayckbourn
I
t's that time of year again. A s
Spring slowly grinds it's way into
Summer, and most people's
heads are full of differential equa-
tions, nematodes and q u a n t u m
mechanics, the motley crew that is
DramSoc take it upon themselves
to relieve of us our misery, if only
for a few hours, by performing a
beautifully acted and wonderfully
set play. This year, they've chosen
an excellent play, A Chorus of
Disapproval, an eighties Alan
Ayckbourn, about the trials and tor-
ments of an amateur operatic soci-
ety. It is eye-wateringly funny and
incredibly moving when read as
text, and with the support of a
powerful cast, should spring into
life and become a masterpiece.
The plot centres around a pro-
duction of the Beggars O p e r a by
John Gay, and features such m e m -
orable characters as Dafydd, the
Welsh producer, Hannah, his long-
suffering wife, Linda, the petulant
adolescent, Ian and Fay Hubbard,
the swinging c o u p l e into wife-
swapping parties and a little black-
mail on the side, the seemingly ine-
briated Rebecca Huntley-Pike and
the slightly bemused Guy, the new-
comer whose presence seems to
jar all the protagonists into action,
almost without his knowledge or
consent. Messageless, this play
takes stock characters that we will
all instantly recognise, places them
into a situation where their behav-
iour becomes inevitable, and sits
back and watches them work. The
play seems effortlessly written, the
characters exist, they do not appear
to be the product of someone's
imagination. This is a play almost
tailor-made for a student company,
and as such cannot go wrong. The
writing is faultless and as the major-
ity of the characters are typecast, it
should be execellent.
Do go and see this, it will cheer
you up if you've had a bad exam,
and will relax y o u after all the stress
of this term. As John Gay wrote in
the final song of the operetta, "The
Wretch of To-day, will be Happy
To-morrow".

An Arts Editor Writes....
Despite this college being at the
forefront of scientific, medical and
technological research, p e o p l e
here are woefully narrow-minded
when it comes to the more avant-
garde forms of art. Certain people
have eloquently criticised the exhi-
bitions in the Ante R o o m Gallery,
in particular the 22 club over
Christmas, and s o m e people are
unaware of the presence of such a
gallery in college at all. Yet despite
this, despite the apathy towards
art, I never expected such a con-
servative attitude from s o m e of
the most forward thinking people I
know.
W h e n the last exhibition
appeared, I p o p p e d in to see it,
and was struck by the soullessness
and the sterility of the paintings.
They were extremely well-execut-
ed, but surely to be a successful
artist, y o u need to express some-
thing of yourself in your work; it
seems pointless otherwise. People
don't become artists because they
feel like it, they have to d o it, their
work is their driving force and
g o o d painters express this beauti-
fully. The list of genuine, spiritual
painters is endless. Even s o m e of
the artists in our o w n gallery have
been g o o d , those w h o exhibited
Office Party, a series of paintings,
drawings and sculpture, which I
found extremely enjoyable.
Perhaps M r . Baker missed that
one.
To write "I never thought I
would have a g o o d word for the
Ante R o o m exhibitions," indicates
an astonishing level of arrogance
and narrow-mindedness. Admit-
tedly, some of the work has not
been g o o d , s o m e of it has been
truly dreadful, not "the work of an
educationally subnormal gorilla",
but not great art either. The "paint-
ings [of] obvious form and artistic
insight" so praised by M r . Baker
were soulless, sterile, puerile and
banal. They gave nothing even to
the casual viewer, and would not
have stood up to intense scrutiny.
To be a g o o d draftsman does not
make y o u a g o o d artist. To be able
to reproduce a tree or a vase or a
scene with a hill and a c o w does
not indicate talent or innovation.
M r Baker is entitled to his own
opinion, of course, but I personal-
ly would rather see an exhibition
w h i c h s h o w e d even a hint of
insight than that sort of tacky
greetings card art.
THE POWER OF POSTER
V&A
T
he Power of Poster exhibition
has been on for quite a while
at the V&A. 1 visited it about
five weeks ago for the first time
and liked it so m u c h that I went
again last weekend. It is really
superb.
The exhibition is divided up into
different themes. First one strolls
through the theatre posters with
s o m e of Toulouse-Lautrec's
designs for Paris at the beginning
of the century. There are also s o m e
gorgeous Japanese pieces. The
next r o o m has lots of music related
posters and covers ranging from
Herb Ritts's photo of M a d o n n a for
True Blue to David Hockney's beau-
tiful poster for Parade, an opera-
ballet in N e w York, The film section
shows again a lot of diversity:
Chaplin's early films stand next to
the poster of The Bodyguard. O n e
then moves onto the more political
side of posters. Propaganda is the
key word; pro-army (mainly the
US), anti-war, M a i 68 in France,
Russia....
In this section there are some
a m a z i n g w o r k s : Keith Haring's
painting for a apartheid free South
Africa, Saatchi and Saatchi's preg-
nant man promoting contracep-
tion, the posters about women's
right of vote. This is particularly fas-
cinating since it is the illustration of
progress and man's preoccupa-
tions over these past 100 years: all
the big themes are present.
One then moves on to the
proper commercial side of posters:
adverts for ptoducts like Guinness,
Bisto and Bovril and a few works by
M u c h a the C z e c h artist.The last
r o o m hosts a few more recent
posters including the hilarious
Smirnoff ones and the controver-
sial Benetton advertisements.
This exhibition shows lots of
different functions posters have
had over the years. In a way it is a
brilliant picture of our times and
says a lot about our fears, our ideas
and our dreams. It wouldn't be sur-
prising if these posters have influ-
enced History. They certainly help
to shape our everyday tastes, what
we buy, what is cool, .where we
go, perhaps even w h o w e talk
to...These things d o have incredi-
ble power as the name of the exhi-
bition suggests. The key to it is the
poster the V & A have designed for
its promotion. I had a great time
walking through it and enjoyed it
immensely the second time round
too. I definitely r e c o m m e n d it.

CORNELIA PARKER
The Serpentine Gallery
T
his is the first major retro-
spective of Cornelia Parker's
career. As one of Britain's
best contemporary artists, alj her
exhibits have a feeling of matter
held in suspense. So, for example,
she has a large work consisting of
silverware, run over by a steam-
roller and suspended a foot from
the ground, entitled thirty pieces of
silver. This might not sound that
impressive, but it is. The work that
has gone into producing this piece,
the dedication it shows is quite
breathtaking. Everything seems to
suggest that if y o u had been here
yesterday, y o u would have seen
the bullet go through the dress,
seen the lion savage the bowl, seen
the w h o l e n e s s that has been
replaced by the incompleteness.
She presents us with a fait a c c o m -
pli, and w e must fill in the deed
with our imaginations. M y favourite
exhibit were the figures made from
coins run over by a train, hung from
the ceiling in the shapes of people,
moving slightly in the breeze, as if
they were breathing. This is a
remarkable exhibition, and will
make y o u think deeply about the
way w e view objects. It is worth
seeing, it's free, it's up the road and
it's very, very g o o d . What more can
you ask for?
