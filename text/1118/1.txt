Union AGM Ends in
Farce
MARK BAKER
Last Friday, the Annual General
Meeting of Imperial College
Union was was dramatically
interrupted by student Andy
Southern, who halted the meet-
ing as less than 200 students
were present. The normally sedate
affair at which the annual report is
approved, officers are elected for
the next academic year and the
student body is given an opportu-
nity to quiz their elected
Sabbaticals was dogged with prob-
lems from the start. Due to a major
event in Beit Q u a d - the Andersen
Consulting Pit Stop Challenge - the
venue h a d to be changed to the
U n i o n Dining Hall at the last
minute, leaving s o m e attendees
confused.
The meeting initially proceed-
ed normally, with Natasha Newton
re-elected u n o p p o s e d of a c c o m -
modation officer. The position of
council chair, also chair of the
powerful executive c o m m i t t e e ,
went to Andy King after ex-ICU
President Eric Allsop withdrew his
candidacy. After much discussion
on tuition fees, Simon Lewis was
elected as Equal Opportunities
Officer. There were no candidates
for the posts of R A G Chair and
Transport Officer, and so these
c o u l d not be elected at the
meeting.
Rene Frank, a Biochemistry
Postgraduate, was the only candi-
date for Welfare Officer and field-
ed a barrage of questions. Before
the meeting could move to a vote,
A n d y Southern, a M e c h a n i c a l
Engineering student, shouted
" Q u o r u m ! " and so forced the clo-
sure of the meeting, as around 6 0
students were in attendance rather
than the required 2 0 0 . M r
Southern's actions were evidently
unpopular with those w h o had
made the effort to attend, as a cry
of "You twat!" and similar c o m -
ments were voiced.
In a letter to Felix explaining
the reasoning behind his actions,
M r Southern stated that he did not
halt the meeting out of spite,
claiming "I d o not hate the union,
or resent it." Instead he insisted
that the meeting had to close "in
the interests of the student body"
as there were not enough people
present. M r Southern cited insuffi-
cient publicity as being the chief
cause of the lack of student inter-
est, laying the blame squarely at
the feet of the members of Council.
"They don't want students to
attend the A G M , " he wrote, before
going on to suggest that sabbati-
cal's performance w o u l d be
i m p r o v e d if their actions were
questioned more often.
In response, I C U President
Andrew Heeps said "publicity for
the A G M was put up around the
walkway and the Union o n the
M o n d a y ; however m e m b e r s of
Council have had the date since
November, therefore having the
information to pass to their con-
stituencies." To the claim that he
had not done enough to publicise
the A G M , M r Heeps c o m m e n t e d
that "it is impossible for us to g o
into every lecture theatre, and the
JCR to remind people about the
A G M . " However he d i d not think
that it was a total failure, as "8
times as many more people turned
up this year than last." Indicating
that the months in office have not
yet stripped him of his humour, to
publicise the next A G M he said
"perhaps I should go to the top of
the Queen's Tower, a n d shout
about it."
The rescheduled A G M takes
place today at 12:30 in d B s . The
following posts will be elected;
Welfare Officer, Transport Officer
and R A G Chair. Anyone interested
in standing for these positions
should sign u p opposite the Union
Office in Beit Q u a d . The presenta-
tion a n d a p p r o v a l of the I C U
Annual Report will also occur at the
A G M this Friday lunchtime. All are
very w e l c o m e to attend.

Southern can be read at the Felix
web site - www.su.ic.ac.uk/Felix/
Last Friday afternoon,
Beit Quad was livened up
by the appearence of a
Williams-Renault Formula
One car. Students were
challenged to perform the
fastest wheel change. It
was won jointly, at 14.22
seconds.
