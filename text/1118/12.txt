ICARUS - Kamikaze
Release Date : 1st June *
W
hen handed this C D to
review, I was worried -
very worried. What with
a weird alien-cum-human on the
front cover and an artist by the
name of Icarus, I expected s o m e
hour-long assault of Drum & Bass
that was the soundtrack to the X-
files movie.
The press release told me to lis-
ten in darkness, but shit-scared I
listened to it in the blazing sunlight
surrounded by numerous imple-
ments - ready to repel the devil if
he came.
Thankfully, he never d i d , and an
hour after starting, I was glad to say
that all had changed was m y
perception of what D'n'B is.
Icarus are cousins Ollie Brown
Sam Britton, and this is without a
doubt as fierce as a debut album
comes.

The first tune, Moon Palace is a
dark a n d mysterious affair.
Throughout the C D Drum 'n' Bass
normality is suspended, and the
duo's shared love of mathematics -
phew there's still hope for me yet
(But sadly not those on Joint M a t h s
fk Computing!) - architecture and
industrial development sites leaves
nothing to the imagination. Okay,
so pythagorean identities don't
c o m e flying atcha in tune 3, Agua
Para Mis Abuelos but the influences
of the ruff bassline and melodic
tones lead to seven minutes of
seductiveness.
Xenotransplantation is as weird
as it sounds - a laid back, spooky
intro giving way to twisted beats
before submerging into a tirade of
electronic sounds. Y u m !
Baggage Claim, the last track,
takes musical styles far beyond the
usual D'n'B parameters - having an
almost techno feel to it, and all
tracks link in superbly - highlighting
the skill in this duo's soundtrack
composition.
M o t h exhibits a haunting, d o u -
ble bass cityscape feel, and the
crashing, hypnotic G o r d o n Detail
merge to add yet another more
than worthwhile dimension to the
Recordings of Substance label.

Mixed by Force &. Styles iririr
This is not a cheesy mixed compila-
tion of 4-beat / happy hardcore
anthems as y o u may think, but con-
sists entirely of Force fk Styles o w n
work, quite incredible. I didn't
realise h o w many of the biggest
tracks over the past years where
d o w n to these two. Although it gets
a bit too cheesy for my taste buds
towards the end, it starts out in fine
style with some of the duo's earlier
work that even I've got from a few
years back. So if y o u like your
dance music fast and sometimes
hectic - uplifting with plenty of
piano action and s t o m p i n g
basslines in a hardcore fashion this
should be right up your street and
bring back plenty of memories.
Mogwai. Kicking A Dead Pig
(Eye Q)
Nice title, this album is a collection
of remixes of M o g w a i ' s work by the
likes of H o o d , M a x Tundra, Klute,
DJ Q and even M o g w a i himself.
Plenty of originality all pretty much
on the experimental side of things.
Packed full of novel ideas and
clever little touches - but of limited
appeal due to this experimental
often dark and sometimes plain
insane. Tracks like Helicon 2 starts
out with a minute of mind bending
noise that isn't at all pleasant.
Apart from the o d d harsh crazy
track this album is quite dreamy
and trippy but a little too minimal
for most. If your interested in mak-
ing electronic music of any sort this
is well worth checking as s o m e very
innovative ideas on display.
Anion Tobin. Permutations
(Ninja Rec) * * l / 2
You won't find this one under easy
listening - quite the opposite in
fact. The reason for this is that the
whole album borders on the side of
experimentation, trying new idea
s o m e that work and others that
don't. S o m e of the tracks are chal-
lenging to listen to even sounding
abrasive and distorted. I feel this is
where the problems lie.
With A m o n trying too hard to
be different, the majority of listen-
ers w o u l d s i m p l y not bother
fighting through the first few
strange tracks to the more, dare I
say, normal tracks further into the
album. Like Sordid &. Nightlife a
clever little DfkB number that I
couldn't really see working in a club
set but fits perfectly with the
album, Escape is a track that is cry-
ing out for a full on DfkB mix if y o u
ask me, loads of clever samples
and fx just too minimal on the beat
front.
Influences f r o m Jazz, Blues,
hip-hop, s a m b a DfkB and even
Batucada are pretty obvious with
tracks like Switch which is a jazz
piano intro with whaling trumpet
etc joining in with computer fx over
the top I
Overall I was disappointed with
this album there are some g o o d
tracks here and plenty of clever
ideas but sadley they are in the
minority.
