5 June 1998 COLUMNS
THOUGHT FOR THE DAY
Warning: this column contains the word "Bros'
The recent earthquake in northern
Afghanistan was a terrible natural
blight: a plague of Biblical propor-
tions, tragically killing approximate-
ly five thousand people and injuring
many others. W e d o not even have
the comfort of knowing that insur-
ance companies will be paying the
bills... Where d o y o u reckon this
piece of literally ground-shaking
news should end up in any self-
respecting newspaper? Front page
headline, perchance? W e l l , the
tabloids didn't think so. In fact,
Monday's edition of a certain p o p -
ular tabloid ran as follows: pages
one to five - Hoddle's expulsion of
Paul Gascoigne (bring o n O w e n , I
say); two full-page promotions; a
page 3 girl generously showing her
rear to the world; a full-page a d ;
then stuck between an article about
a man w h o wanted to get married
in prison and a banal piece about
someone w h o managed to get free
entrance to see Scream 2 were
three column inches about a cer-
tain minor earthquake somewhere
in s o m e poor country. A n d three
pages about Ginger Spice.
W h e n y o u consider the m u c h -
publicised bickering of rock
dinosaurs Oasis, w h o are still large-
ly intact, and then compare it to
the relatively strife-free career of
Posh, Ginger, Scary, Baby, Sporty
and Turmeric, you would be forgiv-
en for thinking that Girl Power
w o u l d live forever. This was almost
believable, given that the Fab Five
were one of the few manufactured
bands to actually work their socks
off. Since their chart-topping begin-
ning with Wannabe, their faces
have been everywhere, whether
you like it or not: sponsorship
deals; t w o albums; television
appearances. They put the split
d o w n to artistic differences, but
perhaps after all this time in each
other's company, Geri is as sick of
the sight of the rest of them as a lot
of us seem to be.
Having said all that, credit must
go to them for going for broke.
History suggests that the lifetime of
such a canned p o p delight is not
long, and they seemed to realise
that getting as m u c h money as
possible in as short a space of time
as possible was the way forward.
Look at laughable teen legends
Bros: probably just as m u c h of a
phenomenon as the Spices. The
difference lay in their attitude to
the media. Bros didn't bother m u c h
with it, although sponsorship deals
with second-hand clothes shops
flogging r i p p e d jeans, contracts
with Grolsch, or, more likely, agree-
ments with hydrogen peroxide
manufacturers, would all have been
vaguely possible. Conversely, the
number of Spice-sponsored prod-
ucts expanded seemingly without
limit, as more and more greedy
corporations longed for a grinning
cheeky face on the front of their
latest line of toenail clippers. W h e n
Bros split up, they found them-
selves in serious trouble with
American Express: w h e n Geri left
the Spice Girls, they were worth
tens of millions of pounds each.
Incidentally, Craig Logan, ex-Bros
bassist, m a d e the sensible move;
last I heard he w a s managing
Neneh Cherry, while the other two
are still desperately trying to make
their fantastic comeback records.
They will probably make more
money by signing o n .
So if the next big teen thing are
reading this (admittedly not likely,
unless the Calculus Boys are sign-
ing as w e speak), remember that
your fans will be distressingly fickle.
O n e day, probably sooner than you
think, they will g r o w up.

Salads
Despite the usual p o s t - M a y m o n s o o n season
I'm carrying on with m y s u m m e r theme. This
time I'm looking at the delicate and often c o n -
troversial topic of salads. N o w salads can be
based o n may things: lettuce, tomato, rice,
potato, c o u s c o u s (see Felix 1115) etc.
However, they must be fresh and the ingredi-
ents M U S T be of top quality because that's
where the taste c o m e s from.
So, experiment, mix and match and r e m e m -
ber that lettuce does not just mean iceberg
(which in m y humble opinion has to be the most
uninteresting sorry excuse for a vegetable that
I've ever c o m e across). There are dozens if not
hundreds of different lettuces even if y o u can't
get them all in the supermarket. Cos, chicory,
round, frisee, oakleaf, red oakleaf, scarolle,
cress and I could go o n . They're all available
over here and they're all excellent.
To help ali this greenery go d o w n and also
to complement the simple uncooked vegetable
tastes, it's usual to add s o m e sort of dressing to
a salad. I'll go through the instructions for the
two most c o m m o n and then a short bit on
potato salad which is far too simple and tasty to
miss out.
French Dressing
Put 1 level tablespoonful of s m o o t h french
mustard, preferably from Dijon, and the same
amount of wine vinegar into your salad bowl.
A d d some freshly ground pepper and a pinch of
salt. M i x these up thoroughly crushing the salt
so it dissolves. There's a lot of blah about only
using a w o o d e n bowl and s p o o n but I've always
got g o o d results with any old bowl and a metal
tablespoon. Next, drizzle a small amount of oil
(say about 1 cc for the scientific amongst you)
and stir this into the mustard until it is c o m -
pletely incorporated. Then add a little more oil,
stir, more oil, stir, more oil etc. It is essential
that the oil is fully emulsified each time before

you are no longer safe.
you add any more or it will just separate out
later. O n c e you have used the equivalent of 2
tbl oil y o u can pour the rest of it in more rapid-
ly but keep stirring vigorously. You'll need to use
a total of around 6 tablespoons of oil (i.e. 6
parts oil to 1 part mustard to 1 part vinegar) but
taste the dressing when you've finished and
adjust the seasoning as they say.
Mayonnaise
For this one the state of the bowl IS impor-
tant. I like using a ceramic one because there is
a lot of stirring to be done and a g o o d thick
bowl won't move around too m u c h . It must be
spotlessly clean and dry. A possibly useful trick
is to make sure all the ingredients and the bowl
are at the same (room) temperature. Gently
crack an egg and separate the yolk, removing as
m u c h of the white as possible. Plonk the yolk
into the bowl, add a small tablespoon of mus-
tard and mix together well. The process is basi-
cally the same as for french dressing, mixing in
the oil drop by drop and making sure it is c o m -
pletely mixed in before adding any more until
you have a fairly substantial amount of mayon-
naise at which point y o u can start adding the oil
in more rapidly. O n e egg yolk is enough for
around 2 0 0 m l of oil so don't be shy. You know
the mayonnaise is ready w h e n y o u can make it
into sharp peaks by pulling the s p o o n out. Stop
adding oil and mixing at this point. It's usually a
g o o d idea to add something acidic to a mayon-
naise just to counterbalance all that grease. A
couple of tbl of vinegar or lemon juice should
do the trick
Potato Salad
W a s h but d o not peal 2 lb new potatoes.
Cut them into bitesize pieces and cook in sim-
mering water until just tender. Finely chop a
shallot and slice a stick of celery. Put all the
above in a large bowl, sprinkle generously with
salt and ground pepper, a d d 4-5 tbl of olive oil
and mix well.
Dear me, the stress of these recipes!
