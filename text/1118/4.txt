Letters to Felix,
USS SUCCESS
Dear Jeremy,
I would like t o remind every-
body about the 'Ethics for U S S '
campaign that Imperial got a taste
of at the beginning of the year.
'Ethics for USS' has received
wide support from lecturers across
the country. T h e national
Association of University Teachers
(the largest lecturers union) has
now, almost unanimously passed a
motion in support of 'Ethics for
USS' and individual lecturer support
is growing all the time.
The largest single investors o n
the stock exchange are the pension
funds. U S S , t h e 'University
Superannuation S c h e m e ' invests
about 13.5 billion pounds a year in
industries around the world. This
gives the pension fund investors
vast amounts of power and influ-
ence in the way that public c o m p a -
nies and multinationals are run.
Ethics for USS is a campaign
calling o n t h e University
Superannuation Scheme t o adopt
an 'Ethical investment Policy'. It
would currently be impossible t o
invest that much money using any
trustworthy ethical investment cri-
teria, so the campaign calls on the
Superannuation S c h e m e t o u s e
their influencial power to change
the operations o f u n s c r u p u l o u s
companies in which they invest.
The greatest irony in the pen-
sion system is that the pension of
every individual is invested o n the
stock exchange for m a x i m u m
return. In order t o acheive maxi-
mum return for their shareholders
(ie. Pension funds), companies are
more likely t o disregard t h e
Environment, a n d anything that
costs them money such as their
own employees. Currently w e are
seeing the 'Corporatisation' of
Universities which gives us less
choice over what w e research and
little say over what is done with our
work. This 'cyclic' chain of events
means that unless e m p l o y e e s
(public and private) take a stance to
break the chain by investing their
pensions ethically, they are their
own victims.
Although investing 'Ethically'
inevitably means investing in small-
er companies, there is evidence to
suggest that spreading money in
this way gives better return, apart
from which, USS pensions are guar-
anteed anyway, which means that
you can't d o yourself A N Y harm by
supporting this vital campaign.
For more information, I a m
available at t.c.smith@ic.ac.uk or
alternatively contact 'Third World
First' (contact details below) to
pledge your support. At least twen-
ty five IC lecturers already have.

HOUSE OF HELL IV
Dear Felix
Following a rather nasty flood
on Tuesday, I have compiled a list
of anti-flood precautions:
1. If y o u live in the top of a Victorian
terraced house, make sure the
landlord has the gutters cleaned
out regularly.
2. Notify your landlord if y o u see
wet patches in the ceiling after
heavy rain. Unless it is a hole in
the roof, then the gutters need
cleaning immediately.
3. If y o u are unlucky and water
does c o m e in, y o u M U S T turn
the power off at the main fuse
STRAIGHT AWAY as the water
will c o m e through t h e light
fixings first.
4. If the water is really pouring in,
you need t o make holes in the
ceiling (with knife or a screw-
driver) everywhere that is wet.
Water will gush out of these
holes a n d make a dreadful
mess, but if y o u don't then the
ceiling will collapse and make a
m u c h worse mess.
5. M o v e coursework and notes first
because everything else is cov-
ered by insurance.
6. M a k e sure everything is dry
(including the inside of sockets)
before turning the power on.
If y o u are considering renting a
top floor flat, look at the ceiling very
carefully. Ask about any staining or
loose wallpaper near to outside
walls.
Other clues are different types
of wallpaper in the same r o o m or
only rooms along o n e wall being
freshly painted. Don't be fobbed off
by the landlord saying that it has
been sorted out. It needs doing
several times a year.
I know this seems like overkill
but had I not been in o n Tuesday
morning, I would have returned to
find my books, notes and computer
ruined and wet plaster over every-
thing. Even so, I still jump out of my
skin at the sound of running water!

FELIX HASN'T A
CLUE
Sir,
Why has ISIHAC (I'm sorry, I
haven't a clue) been placed as the
bottom mark in last weeks music
section? ISIHAC has been a popular
radio panel game for almost 2 5
years. I would like t o say it is as
funny today as it was 2 5 years ago,
but since I'm only 20, I can't really
comment. It does however have a
large lisenership, w h o regularly tune
in to hear the manic and often sur-
real games played by the panellists.
ISIHAC regularly hosts talents
such as Tim Brook Taylor, Paul
M e r t o n a n d Samantha. O n e c a n
hear games such as the simple, but
complex sounding 'One song to the
tune of another', 'Guess the bar-
code' and of course the infamous
'Mornington Crescent'?
ISIHAC is an example of eccen-
tric British humour at its best. It can
stand alongside M o n t y Python and
Spike Milligan as c o m e d y classics.
With the surplus of monotonous
sitcoms and cheap American tat o n
radio and TV, I feel that this form of
criticism is unfounded and to be
avoided. I hope that, in future, y o u
will show more respect for this
oasis of Britishness.

Really, Ross, I rather think you're
being a bit uncharitable there, old
chap, what with that Sorry I
Haven't a Clue being, well, rather
pointless, what with all that
Mornington Crescent nonsense,
Henry, and oh there's a number
24 going down the Kilburn Park
Road, I mean one never really
knows what they're talking about,
does one oh, that was a beautiful
googlie going down the off side
and Jack's tossed it to his man at
siliy-mid-off who lobs it to Gough
at long leg I mean to say, you
wouldn't catch us talking such
nonsense, Henry, it's rather
inane, that's all oh and there's a
troop of three pigeons wandering
rather languidly across the out-
field and a rather gothic choco-
late cake has been thrust into my
hand etc etc...
