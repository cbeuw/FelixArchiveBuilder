COLUMNS oV STARS 5 June 1998
Tom Smith's letter, on
behalf of Third World First,
cannot go unanswered. For
those of you that skipped
the letters page in a frantic effort to
get straight to my humble prose, the
Association of University Teachers
have passed a motion to promote
'ethical' investment by the
University Superannuation Scheme,
the lecturers' pension fund. This, as
Tom pointed out, was first raised a
few months ago, and I had my
doubts. I still do. These objections
were principally practically, suggest-
ing that the fund's investment
returns may fall, a view that was
countered with 'it doesn't matter
because the pension is guaranteed.'
True, insofar as the payouts are
fixed at a fixed proportion for every
year of service, but if the returns dip,
someone will have to pick up the
tab. This is most likely to be the
employers or the government, but
either way the shortfall cannot sim-
ply be met by magic. In the end, we
all pay. T o m is right in saying that
the pension funds wield consider-
able influence, but the USS's £13.5
billion is relatively insignificant in the
grand scheme of things. Pension
funds do exert influence, but this is
principally used to maximise share-
holder value, not political trouble-
making. The notion that the USS can
change the world is nonsense.
In order to invest 'ethically',
Tom suggests that it will be neces-
sary to invest in smaller companies.

moment the impli- i
cation that all large Qj

to destroy the
world, it may be
true that small,

the A U T .
However, his sug-
gestion that such investment can
lead to higher returns is very mis-
leading. 1 agree that if you manage
to pick the next minnow about to
turn into a whale, the profits will be
spectacular, but the chances of get-
ting one's fingers burnt increase
exponentially. This is not the way
that a responsible pension fund
behaves. Following Tom's advice,
ethical investment soon becomes as
prudent as five card stud.
Moreover, smaller companies have
significantly underperformed the
top 100 companies over the last
few years. Given the choice
between shares in Glaxo or a tinpot
macrame outfit, I
r™n| know where I'd
put my cash. In
^ ("^ his quest to save
' ty^ the world from
c a p i t a l i s t
r**j* exploitation by
) the West (social-
ism and environ-
mentalism are
•
never far apart),
Tom forgets the
S * —^" ethical question
f"+ of playing fast
and loose with
the pensions of Britain's lecturers. If
things went spectacularly wrong, we
would all suffer. It is not acceptable
to engage in gesture politics in this
manner, and 1 hope that the USS
trustees see sense.

known that he doesn't agree in the
slightest - see editorial]
Elsewhere, w e have had the first
Conservative reshuffle since the
election, and it seems to have been
very sensible. Peter Lilley is more
suited to the deputy leadership,
where his policy-making skills will be
used to greatest effect. The promo-
tion of Anne W i d d e c o m b e to
Shadow Health spokesman is
inspired. At the risk of stating the
obvious, the w o m a n is terrifying.
Frank Dobson must be praying for
Blair to reshuffle, because she will
wipe the floor with him. Frank, bless
him, is not the sharpest tool in the
box, and any reluctance to change
jobs must have instantly evaporated.
Finally, not one week after I sang
the praises of the recent Ante Room
exhibition N o w it appears that
something very wrong is occurring.
The windows have been covered
with Bacofoil and flashing lights
have been observed inside. I fear
that some poor soul feels this is art,
but there are other explanations.
Either Sherfield are beginning a pro-
gramme of mass hypnosis or we've
got the builders in. If this is the case,
I apologise.
