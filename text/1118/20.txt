Angry Fists
They knew exactly what lay ahead
of them as they set out early last
Sunday morning. The three; M i k e
Corrigan (ME4), and Paul Watson
(CE4) together with Nick "Kick-ass
from Hellas" Kassapakis (Phys
PhD), having trained for 4 years
with the IC Kung
Fu club, were
going for black
belt.
After a fine
display of forms
(fixed m o v e -
ments), the
action began to
heat up as the
free sparring got
underway. The 2-
v-1 bouts were
fierce with M i k e
moving so fast
around his t w o
opponents that he left a trail of
flames burning in the ring and Paul
taking a bit of a bruising from two
trained thugs. Next came the group
sparring with o p p o s i t i o n f r o m
Manchester and Wales. This event
saw Paul trying his best not to acci-
dentally knock, people out with his
lethal turning kick (unsuccessfully).
As bout after bout was fought and
w o n , the IC boys began to show
that it wasn't just big IQ's that they
were packing. Having sorted out
the animate objects, now the only
challenge left to the team was the
breaking.
All three smashed their way
through eight roof
tiles with only just
enough time to
apply the D e e p
Freeze before
having to c h o p
clean through a

was two inches
of w o o d , but not
for long as the
explosive power rocketed from the
feet of the IC masters, initiating
fast fracture in the organic c o m -
posite.

Korfball (?)
It was some time on a Sunday
morning that I didn't know even
existed and the UL Korfball team
were heading out to Cambridge
in search of success and fortune.
But what is korfball You must be
wondering [Not really - Jacob].
It's a Dutch game similar to bas-
ket ball and net ball in that y o u
have to get a ball into a basket
more times than the opposition
but that is where the similarities
end. For a start, it is played by
mixed teams. The baskets are
m o v e d towards the centre of
each half so that when y o u miss a
shot, play continues. This hap-
pens very frequently as the bas-
kets are higher than in either of
the other two games.
Before we knew what was
happening, w e were in to the final
against our old rivals Cambridge
University. The game went into
extra time. After two minutes w e
had managed to creep into the
lead 3-4, winning the club's third
piece of silverware in 18 years.
Anybody interested in taking
up korfball, contact the club pres-
ident, M a r c u s
(m.scotti@ic.ac.uk) or see our

Cricket
IC 1st were playing in the semi-
final. A s w e massed in the union
the signs were grim. For a start
there were three second teamers.
However, it was a talented bunch
that arrived at Harlington, after we
had disposed of their firsts in the
previous years semi-final.
The batting started solidly with
jon scoring about as frequently as
his football namesakes and Imran
Khan playing nowhere near as well
as his. W e then attempted England
(cricket) style suicide as w e lost
seven wickets for about fifty runs
before Graham rescued the team
with a sparkling 42 not out. Our
final score of 158 - 8 looked
respectable but the gold was yet to
c o m e .
Raj started with a superb over
into the wind. Mardar took two
wickets in his spell, delivering the
ball like a tracer bullet, not bad for
a guy with a girls' name. Archi and
jon took most of the remaining
wickets and IC Ists are into the
final to defend the title we w o n last
year.
The final is Wednesday after-
noon and the coach leaves at
12.30pm from the Union. All sup-
porters are very welcome. It will be
a great day out.
