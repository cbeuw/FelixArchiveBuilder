College Cash Bungs
for BMS Builders
JEREMY THOMSON
IC Estates Department is giving
out cash bonuses to construction
team supervisors in a bid to get
the Bio-medical Building complet-
ed in time.
A weekly prize of £ 2 0 0 is being
handed over to the best foreman,
as judged by a panel consisting of
representatives from Estates and
Schal, the main contractors. A fur-
ther £ 1 0 0 0 a week is being set
aside toward a gigantic party on 15
June, subject to workers attaining
weekly progress targets.
N o w in its fifth week, the
scheme is intended to motivate
subcontractors w h o s e w o r k has
been repeatedly undone as more
and more changes to the original
design have become necessary. So
far, £4m has been spent on alter-
ations, often forcing work to be
ripped out and replaced. "There's
been an inordinate amount of fit-
out adaptions - 60 or 70 rooms
have been affected", explained Phil
Hilton, the project manager, "it is
demoralising and frustrating [for the
builders] so see finished, painted
and plastered rooms being ripped
out."
These alterations are pushing
the competion date of the recently-
named Fleming building back, leav-
ing less and less time for the
Biology and Medical departments
to move in before term starts in
October. The planned hand-over
date has m o v e d from 13 April to
"early August". Although unable to
give a definate date, M r Hilton told
us that "we are contracted to have
the building ready for undergradu-
ate teaching on 1 October, and we
will", although he did conceed that
it was getting "close".
M o r e controversial is the fund-
ing for the scheme. According to a
source close to the Estates
Department, the bonuses were
originally intended to be £ 1500
cash, rather than £ 2 0 0 . However,
there was "deep concern" over
realeasing this money, and the col-
lege auditors had to be contacted.
M i k e Hansen, however,
appeared to be unaware of the
spending. "I know that it was dis-
cussed", he said, "but 1 don't know
any details. It's up to [lan] Caldwell
and his team to build the building,
and we'll just let him get on with it."

Students Dry in US
UNCLE SAM
Students across the USA have
been staging protests and riots
last month over alcohol bans.
Tear gas was used against a 3000-
strong group in Mitchigan, w h o
pelted police after alcohol was
banned at a football match.
The legal drinking age in
America is 21 - a rule which is being
enforced with increasing vigilance
by campus police. Some universi-
ties have even banned drinking
altogether.
Students caught offending are
likely to be arrested, not by the
State Police, but by officers on
campus. These security guards are
sworn-in police officers, and rou-
tinely carry 9 m m pistols. The
University of California (Los Angeles
Campus) has 75 such officers, but
San Diego University goes further;
officers carry back-up handguns,
and two patrol cars are fitted with
prominent shotgun-racks.
IC's own Chief Security Officer,
Ken Weir, when asked about the
possibility of supplying weapons to
officers, said "we considered
batons and handcuffs, but realised
that there'd be nowhere left on the
belts to put the M a g n u m s . "
News in Brief...
GOVENMENT
DECLARE PARTY
Chris Smith, Secretary for Culture,
has announced an extra day's
national holiday on 31 December
1998. This means that there are
now four straight days across the
millennium in which to celebrate
and recover, as M o n d a y 3 January
2 0 0 0 is also a bank holiday.
MANAGING
MENINGITUS
A n e w stratagy on managing
meningitus outbreaks was
released today by the Committee
of Vice-Chancellors and Principles
(CVCP). It encourages all universi-
ties to devise a strategy to deal
with the disease, which is two-
and-a-half times more c o m m o n in
15-19 year olds than the rest of
the populations.
Its release follows the deci-
sion by Southampton University
to vaccinate all freshers this year,
after three students died there
last year.
TUITION FEES
REVOLT
The Prime Minster faces a poten-
tially damaging backbench revolt
next week over the plans to
impose £ 1,000 tuition fees on
students. Labour M P s have held
meetings to encourage support
for what some fear could be a
protest equal in size to the last
year's rebellion over cuts in bene-
fit to single mothers, where one
minister and four parliamentary
private secretaries resigned and
47 Labour M P s voted against the
Government.
Senior Government sources
are anxious to avoid a repeat per-
formance, and, until n o w ,
believed that the Education
Secretary David Blunkett had
done enough with a series of con-
cessions. Opposition, however, is
hardening against his Teaching
and Higher Education Bill before
its final C o m m o n s stages early
next week.
Rebels claim that the move
flies in the face of Labour's sup-
port for free university education
for all.
W h e n a d d e d to plans to
w i d e n the s y s t e m of student
loans, they fear students will face
debts of more than £ 1 3 , 0 0 0 after
they finish their degrees.

TUBE STRIKE
CHAOS FEARS
Following an "overwhelming" vote
by Tube members of the Rail
Maritime and Transport Union,
Union leaders are to decide
whether to order industrial action
across L o n d o n U n d e r g r o u n d .
They are protesting over the
Government's intention to part-
privatise the Underground system
to raise billions of pounds in
investment money. The leaders
a n n o u n c e d their decision last
night, after emergency sessions
all day yesterday.
Some staff will be transferred
to the private companies and
widespread job losses are feared.
Feelings are running high a m o n g
union officials, with some press-
ing for 4 8 - h o u r stoppages.
Industrial action was backed by
2,471 members, with 462 against
but only 4 9 per cent of more than
6,000 eligible staff returned their
ballot papers. Despite L o n d o n
Underground claims that Deputy
Prime Minister John Prescott has
given assurances on issues such
as pay and working hours, RMT
assistant general secretary Bob
Crow said: " W e have been trying
for months to get the company to
discuss these issues but they have
refused to d o s o . " Industrial
action by staff would seriously
disrupt rail services, and poten-
tially cause chaos.
NO FELIX FOR

Please note that the next issue,
the last of the term, will be issued

sible, in the Union Resource
