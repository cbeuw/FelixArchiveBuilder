LEAVES UNDER ICE
ARTS GAMES 5 June 1998
NOT OVERLOOKED

t's the ice from our bird bath in
the winter", the artist explained
to me at the private viewing on
21st M a y . "I found it defrosting in
the kitchen sink when I got h o m e
and I liked the look of it." 1 looked
more closely at the Bird Water
series. "I put a square of glass on
the middle of it for the second one
and took it off again for the third.
The ice was melting under the
lights and y o u can see the leaf
frozen into it."
This is Paul Kenny's debut exhi-
bition in London and runs until
20th June. The artist's subjects are
leaves, rocks and ice in this collec-
tion of chloro-bromide prints. The
>rity of the pieces s h o w leaves

the artist's studio. The vein struc-
ture is > tptured and reproduced in

beauty and complexity of nature.

Overall, it is Paul Kenny's great
appreciation of fine, detail and tex-
ture which makes his v ork so
appealing. The subject matte
something we have all seen, and
most of us wouldn't really think of
examining in any detail; the artist's
work demonstrates how much M R
ural beauty goes unnotice I and
unappreciated.

AS YOU LIKE IT
Shakespeare's Globe Theatre
I
t was an interesting experience
to see As You Like It being done
at The Globe Theatre. It is a
venue which allows for rather more
audience involvement than most
theatres. It was rather unfortunate
therefore that I never quite
engaged with the characters and
did not feel the need to shout
abuse/encouragement at t h e m .
There was, nonetheless, s o m e
audience participation but it felt
rather fake.
Being a 'groundling' has its dan-
gers (and not only severe backache
from standing up for three hours),
there was fighting in and through
the audience as well as various
actors making entrances through
the pit - in one case sending an
elderly member of the audience fly-
ing backwards into the c r o w d . In
the Sixteenth Century the
groundlings were liable throw rot-
ten fruit at the actors; modern
audiences tend to be slightly more
restrained, though they may have
to duck flying vegetation c o m i n g
from the direction of the stage.
The Globe runs the risk of
becoming a tourist attraction rather
than a serious theatre space if peo-
ple go there for the sake of the
going to The Globe instead of going
there to see plays. I was therefore
delighted that this production was
of such high quality. The humour of
the piece was really brought out
a n d d e p t h a n d subtlety were
apparent in many of the characters,
I felt I knew what they were think-
ing all the time - even w h e n they
said nothing.
The only problem I really had
with the play w a s the ending,
which is very hurried and contrived,
but it didn't really matter. M i n d
you, I could have done without the
seventy year o l d G o d of Marriage
c o m i n g on at the end in just a
beard, antlers and a pair of birds
nest pants!

ITS COMING HOME, ITS COMING HOME...
EA SPORTS : WORLD CUP '98

Hurrah, the World C u p is about to
interrupt what would be otherwise
an appallingly e m p t y s u m m e r .
Luckily for all y o u sofa football fans
there are several new footie games
to play before, in the gaps between
and after the games.
The youngster 3-Lions shows
its lack of experience at this level
and is d r o p p e d from the team,
luckily the two older t e a m - m e m -
bers International Superstar Soccer
and FIFA '98 have been kitted out
for another competition. The ISS
release has yet to make it out for
training but FIFA W o r l d C u p '98 is
out on the pitch w a r m i n g up. The
PC version demonstrated on a top
Pentium 2 system with a D i a m o n d
Monster II card stormed out like a
world c u p winner. The graphics
were superb, most of the England
crew actually l o o k e d like their
namesakes, and tjie rather fluid
motion capture system has been
designed to mimic specific moves
for certain players - though m y
complete lack of knowledge of the
Brazilian t e a m d i d prevent m e
checking this out. The expected
football soundscape as found on
TV is all there, from crowd roar to
commentary from such experts as
Des Lynham and Chris W a d d l e
(obviously for penalties). As for the
gameplay, well should you grow
bored of England winning the final
for the twentieth time there is
always the option of playing as an
historical team such as the England
1966 t e a m , Brazil 1970 or
Germany 1990's teams.
As football games go it is the
best yet, not quite the "pissing into
the eyes' of the opposition" that
PC Zone said it would be, but a
step above the previous titles.
W o u l d I buy it? Possibly not, I'd
wait to see if the Konami ISS game
was better and without a decent
3d card I wouldn't risk it.

Fed up with your standard pad?
Already bought the analogue and
game specialised pads? Well per-
haps the "Glove" is for y o u . For just
less than £ 5 0 it can give the user
the refined look of a total idiot and
possibly an a d v a n c e d case of
repetitive strain injury. The glove
also provides a crucial advantage in
competition as human opponents
are unable to concentrate and
instead are mesmerised, watching
your hands wobble in apparently
random directions.
Apparently the glove is able to
operate in three different modes;
as the standard digital pad, as an
analogue pad or in simulated ana-
logue m o d e to give your digital
responses a winning edge. Using
the glove is actually easier than
expected. Flexing the wrist controls
the directions, while the buttons
are on the tips of your fingers.
There is as y o u would expect a
slight weirdness with this but the
designer says that it soon becomes
almost pleasurable. H m m one for
the Lara Croft crowd then.
