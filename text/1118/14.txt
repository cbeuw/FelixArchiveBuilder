THE GENERAL
Starring: Brendan Gleeson, )on Voight, Adrian Dunbar
Director: John B o o r m a n * * * Vi
The Irish - a very peaceful people. No, honestly.
C
all me a cynic, but after John
Boorman w o n Best Director
for this film at Cannes, 1 was
somewhat sceptical about going to
see it. You see, the views of those
wonderful people at Cannes don't
usually agree with mine. This time,
however, I was pleasantly sur-
prised...
The General was produced for
an absurdly small budget (even by
British standards), secured almost
entirely on the basis of Boorman's
reputation, and is shot entirely in
black and white. In a not wholly
unoriginal format, the film begins
with the final scene and then retro-
spectively chronicles the life and
works of the infamous Irish criminal
Martin Carhill, aka. The General.
Played by Brendan Gleeson,
Carhill's story begins with his child-
hood on one of the poorest estates
in Dublin, where he spends his days
stealing food and escaping the Irish
police (the Garda). C o u p l e d with
the nostalgic black &. white filming,
this generates a sympathy for the
character w h i c h , as the story
unfolds, appears undeserved.
Endless conflicts with the
Garda, time in a Catholic borstal
with the inevitable molestation,
and then time in jail fuel Carhill's
growing animosity towards author-
ity. Indeed, at times his whole life
appears to be a non-stop battle to
insult, harass and embarrass the
Garda.
It is here that the only fault with
the film appears. It combines a
portrait of a gangland criminal, with
a charicature of a loveable rogue,
testing the audience's loyalty to
s o m e o n e w h o was after all a bad
and dangerous m a n . This is easily
forgivable t h o u g h , as the dark
scenes are suitably dark and the
c o m e d y suitably funny. The o d d
loose end here and there doesn't
detract from the film either.
Strong performances by
Gleeson and Jon Voight, as the
Garda Inspector always one step
behind Carhill, along with great
support in the form of Carhill's
(rather intriguing) family and gang,
keep the audience engrossed.
Great cinematography just puts the
icing o n what is already an
admirable cake.
M y only advice to anyone going
to see this film (and I r e c o m m e n d
that y o u do) w o u l d be not to
expect a big climax. This is after all
a true story - the life of a man who,
as a criminal (albeit a legendary
one), had too much faith that he
w o u l d never be caught. D

AFTERGLOW
Starring: Julie Christie, Nick Nolte, Jonny Lee Miller, Lara Flynn Boyle
Director: Alan Rudolph
R
epair men eh? W h e n they're
not charging y o u a-hundred-
and-fifty quid to replace a
washer on a bank holiday, they
enjoy nothing more than seducing
lonely housewives with the subtle
combination of a cocky grin and a
little plumbing related innuendo -
or so we have been led to believe
by thirty years of British situation
comedy. However, on the evidence
of Afterglow things aren't so differ-
ent in Montreal.
Nick Nolte plays Lucky M a n n , a
repair contractor whose easy going
charm presents him with ample
opportunity to break his w e d d i n g
vows. His improprieties b e c o m e
understandable w h e n w e are intro-
duced to his wife Phyllis, played by
Julie Christie. She is a former B-
movie actress w h o spends her time
reminiscing about her past with the
aid of tapes of her old films and the
o d d gin.
Despite N o l t e ' s g o o d
humoured attempts to heal the
obvious rift in their marriage, Phyllis
s e e m s to derive s o m e sort of
masochistic pleasure f r o m her
woeful situation.
Conversely, Jonny Lee Miller
has all the outward trappings of
success - a salary large enough to
live in a ridiculously flash apart-
ment, and to keep his beautiful
wife, Lara Flynn Boyle, in all the
designer frocks her heart desires.
However, Miller is too w o u n d up in
himself to spare any time for his
slightly neurotic wife w h o has little
chance of fulfiling her wish to have
a baby.
Four cliched characters lan-
guishing in two dysfunctional mar-
riages isn't the most lively of open-
ings, and the entirely expected
affair of Nolte and the attention
starved Boyle lends little freshness
to the proceedings. A n unlikely
symmetry is completed when the
pursuit of the unfaithful pair brings
Miller and Chrisstie together.
Captivated by the older w o m a n ,
Miller offers her an indulgent ear,
and eventually we learn of the
painful episode on which she is
dwelling.
The film goes on to relate the
conflicting a n d often ill-defined
desires of the principle characters.
Unfortunately, Afterglow frequently
ends up as confused as they are.
Chrisite's self-absorbed melancholy
b e c o m e s too irritating before we
learn of it's cause, and Miller's
executive b o r e d o m is exceptionally
grating. His assertions that he is
only 'excited by the impossible'
merely s u c c e e d in m a k i n g him
sound even more juvenile. In fact,
the characters are so unsympathet-
ic that any interest in them dwin-
dles to mild curiosity pretty rapidly.
Perhaps the only saving grace
is Nick Nolte's assured perfor-
m a n c e . His portrayal of Lucky,
being forced to question his easy
going outlook is far more convinc-
ing than Julie Christie's overacting.
Afterglow is an unusual film, but its
purported insights into human
nature are far too vague to consti-
tute anything other than hollow
pretension. D
