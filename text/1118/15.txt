T
hose of us in the Chinese
community will k n o w C h o w
Yun-Fat as the square jawed
man from Hard Boiled, The Killer
and Cod of Gamblers to name just
a few. This m a n is a household
name all over South East Asia a n d
like Bruce and Jackie before h i m ,
C h o w Yun-Fat is m a k i n g that
important leap into Hollywood.
The Replacement Killers is an
action thriller with a simple plot,
but spiced up with high action.
Chow Yun-Fat (keeping dialogue to
a m i n i m u m in his first English lan-
guage role) is an assassin w h o
finally takes heed of his conscience
when powerful underworld figure
Mr W e i requests Yun-Fat to be an
instrument of vengeance. Realising
that his defiance is worse than
smoking fifty a day, C h o w Yun-Fat
plans to return to China.
Now requiring a passport, he
meets up with master document
forger M i r a Sorvino (surprisingly
plausible portraying a tough cook-
ie), and the whole film then goes
ballistic as M r W e i sends a small
d'-. :
army of m e n to tie up loose ends.
Above the guns a n d explosions
there are some g o o d scenes, with
director Fuqua, w h o s e previous
experience lies in directing music
videos, has a d d e d an M T V flavour
to the action sequences, using a
car wash a n d a dance floor in key
m o m e n t s .
This H o l l y w o o d p r o d u c t i o n
tries desperately to have the same
essence as H o n g Kong action films.
However its attempt to emulate
John W o o ' s uniqueness, the sheer
Chow Yun-Fat: Cool or what?
style a n d flair that Hard Boiled a n d
more recently Face/Off have estab-
lished, is way off. Towards the e n d
of the film, The Replacement Killers
lacks suspense in its action scenes
and relies o n cat a n d m o u s e
sequences and heavy pyrotechnics
to mask over an implausible con-
clusion.
The Replacement Killers is like
making popcorn - heat in a well
oiled pan, a d d the kernels a n d then
watch them explode. Dl

Tickets prizes galore courtesy of
KENSINGTON
T
his week, five pairs of tickets
for U S s m a s h hit The
Wedding Singer are u p for
grabs. Starring A d a m Sandler a n d
Drew Barrymore, it's a trip through
the early eighties, complete with
bandanas, mullets, a n d n o n stop
new romantics soundtrack. G e t
ready to relieve styles which I'm
sure e w all want to forget.
So, without more a d o here's
this week's fiendishly hard ques-
tion:

Good Will Hunting, Sphere,
Michael Collins and Nixon?

STAR PROFILE:
CHOW
YUN-FAT
C
how Yun-Fat is one of the
biggest film stars on the
planet - yet unless you're a
fan of the kind of destruction fest
that is the hallmark of H o n g Kong
c i n e m a , y o u probably haven't
heard of him.
This week, however, he aims
to change all that, by emulating
Jackie C h a n a n d hitting the
Hollywood big time. Quite w h y is
anyone's guess, but the promise
of mega pay days presumably has
something to d o with it. In his o w n
words " i n H o n g Kong the stunt is
very expensive a n d the star is very
cheap"
His fame owes a lot to a long
term collaboration with God-like
director John W o o , with w h o m he
has m a d e international hits such
as Hard Target, The Killer and the
A Better Tomorrow trilogy, and
perfected his trademark "tooth-
pick c h e w i n g " . H o w e v e r , even
with such a high profile collabora-
tor he has yet to make a real break
in the English language market,
with his fan base primarily concen-
trated in South East Asia.
Hopefully, this week's release
of The Replacement Killers will
change all that, s h o w i n g
H o l l y w o o d h o w to make action
films properly - ridiculous body-
count, idiotic cops, ultra violence,
hideously scarred villains, a n d ,
most importantly, bucket loads of
style.
