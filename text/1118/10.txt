PEACH TRICKY

t's summer and the mosqui-
toes are out in force, congre-
gating under trees and lying in
wait for bare arms and lazy stu-
dents w h o want to listen to their
brand new CDs in the glorious out-
doors, instead of in the stuffy, sub-
tropical heat of their bedrooms.
That said, this time of year is
exceptionally stressful for every-
one. I've had a terrible lab course, a
lot of write-ups to fake and whole
amount of revision to plough
through, as well as the day job, and
so I decided to practise Critical
Path Analysis by reviewing this
album in my sleep. I started listen-
ing to it at eleven o'clock o n Friday
night, and by four a m Saturday 1
was h o o k e d o n the electronic,
summery, sort-of sexy music pro-
duced by the strong female fronted
band Peach. With her slightly flat
voice, Lisa Lamb is the perfect
accompaniment to revision and lab
Tricky with his
new Marilyn
Monroe wig.
A
fter listening to this, 1 was
astonished by both the level
of brilliance and of the sheer
crapness that this album managed
to achieve. I've never been a fan of
the m a n , but his albums have
always provided me with two or
three choice cuts. This time
around the said choice cuts are of
real quality but the rest are not
really worth the listening time.
Unless y o u are a real fan, of
course.
After such a long time away (so
long that his o w n uncle is probably
a bigger star now) I didn't k n o w
what to expect. After listening to
Angels With Dirty Faces, I'm still
unsure about its actual content. A s
an album, it s o m e h o w manages to
go from one end of the spectrum
to the other - with most of it at the
dreadful end.
Mellow kicks the album off with
a wicked backing but it is ruined by
Tricky singing in a strange high-
pitched voice; once he returns to
his usual whispering/rapping per-
sona, the track salvages s o m e
respectability. The next track,
Singin' The Blues is my favourite.
It, quite literally, sings the blues.
Tricky's female singing partner,
M a r t i n a , features over a funky
backing and it is superb - it has to
be heard to be believed. Broken
Homes features the talents of P. J.
Harvey o n vocals. The result is
eerie but works quite well. O n the
Moment I Feared, Tricky covers
Slick Rick and the question is, sim-
ply, why? This is awful and should
have been left well alone. Carriage
For Two pops up half way through
the the album and is very o d d . It is
very slow and has those great
w h i s p e r e d vocals that create a
feeling of real darkness in the song.
Throughout the song, M a r t i n a
sings the verse from Billie
H o l l i d a y ' s God Bless The Child
and, this may sound strange, it
c o m e s off well.
1 was indifferent to this as an
album. If y o u are a fan then you've
probably already got it but if you
aren't, then just buy the singles.
Leave this album alone. H
Milen
reports, and I've had the C D o n
loop all day. The music is extreme-
ly poppy and makes me want to
put on my six-inch platform shoes
and start dancing. I know that this
is a bad idea, as I will fall and break
my leg, but there's something in the
music that just makes me smile like
an idiot. It must be that all the
songs are extremely unchallenging,
without any real meaning or deep
feeling. At heart, this album is hol-
low. But, w h o cares? It's summer,
the sun is shining and I'm tired of
angst-ridden, male-orientated, gui-
tar-led music for naval gazers. This
album has a light, frothy lemon-
mousse, summery, sugary flavour,
and I think it's great, in a slightly
naff and tacky way.
I really, really wanted to slate
this C D . The cover shouts post-
modern, pre-millennium pseudo-
art at you, with its tasteful orange
and cream photographs. The
songs are very sub-St Etienne Euro-
Pop but without the satirical edge.
The single, On my Own, sounds
like Gina G covered by a bunch of
half-witted s c h o o l - c h i l d r e n . . . a n d
yet, as a whole, the album is g o o d .
Like the Spice Girls a n d
Bananarama, Peach grows on y o u .
Sorry. E]
Jessica Rabbit
Fat Boy Slim - The Rockefeller Skunk
Although this song is a tad repetitive, it breaks up the
monotony by simply slowing it right d o w n and then
bringing back the tempo. This pretty wicked track is let
d o w n by its continuous repetitions.
Audioweb - Personal Feeling
It sounds like A u d i o w e b have decided to release a half
hearted attempt at a strings-backed epic. This is a
massive disappointment after the blistering assault of
Policeman Skank.
Arnold - Fishsounds
This is a feeble , boring and bland guitar strumming
joke. The single cover just about sums the song up,
with a pathetically drawn phone. Why?
Quest - Initiate the Creative
It started off with a promising latin beat but ended up
turning into a hybrid of p o p and soul that just grates
after a couple of listens.
Cartoon - Fade Away
Isn't this sucha cliched title for an indie song? Well
don't be surprised because it is an indie song but a
pretty mediocre one at that. 'Drift on the ocean and
fade away ' Yeah, fade right out of my stereo.
Insane Clown Posse - Hokus Pokus
Are this lot meant to be a c o m e d y version of Cypress
Hill. 'Hokus Pokus jokus' is what y o u get for the cho-
rus plus a cringe worhty fairground sample. Save it for
Halloween guys.
T H E E S S E N T I A L C H O O N
Gomez - Get Myself Arrested
This is bluesy and laidback which is basically the recipe
for the perfect summer song. What is it with bands
nowadays, glorifying criminal behaviour. What will be
next?
Ether - Best Friend
Pop is the only w o r d to describe this. You get carried
along with the cheerfulness of it all as much as you try
to resist. Sounding like a mutation between Squeeze
and W h a m can't be a g o o d thing, but it won't stop you
singing along to it.
Pulp - A Little Soul
This is Back For Good isn't it? Are Pulp turning into
Take That wannabes? d
