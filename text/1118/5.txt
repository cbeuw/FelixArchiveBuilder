New VAT regulations pertaining to catering in universities mean
that we must charge VAT to non IC students; ie. staff, students
at other institutions and should the occasion arise, the general
public. We have an agreement with HM Customs and Excise that
during term time we pay over an amount to cover the VAT on a
pre determined percentage of our sales, however, this agree-
ment does not extend to the holidays. During vacations we must
identify whether each customer is an IC student or not, and
charge them VAT if they are not.
so If you show your IC Union Card at the till you will not have
pay VAT on your purchase. If you are a member of staff or you
have no proof of IC student status then we will have to charge
you VAT.

Editorial
O n e of the greatest causes of
human suffering, animal cruelty
and environmental destruction
today is the pernicious barrier that
has been erected between people
and their money.
This may seem like a rather
sweeping statement, but let m e
explain. There are, and always will
be, people so deeply selfish a n d
mercenary that they don't care
whether they are personally fund-
ing and hence supporting torture,
murder and war. These people are
thankfully in the minority, and were
their actions t o be seen directly,
they would probably be branded as
'evil' by society. Yet, oppressive
regimes thrive, millions are exploit-
ed to the point of death and the
planet is being sacked beyond pos-
sibility of recovery, all in the name
of profit for the average investor
(ie. all of you reading this article).
So why d o w e , fair-minded a n d
conscientious people, continue t o
actively promote such atrocities?
Simple - ignorance. N o n e of us
know what our money is being
invested in, a n d further more w e
have no way of finding out.
Take, as an example, the night-
banking system operated by virtu-
ally all British banks. After the close
of business at the stock exchange
and the closure of the banks for the
evening, the colossal sums of
money contained in ordinary cur-
rent accounts is a m a s s e d a n d
invested overnight in Eastern
exchanges. It is then returned (with
profit) the next day, with no-body
any the wiser. You may find it sur-
prising that even the shiny n e w
'ethical' banks such as The C o -
operative bank indulge in this dubi-
ous practice.
What, then, c a n be done to
prevent our money being used to
support causes with which w e ' d
rather drill holes in our head than
be associated? Notice that at the
beginning of this article I did not
say that money itself was causing
these problems. M o n e y is a tool,
and a powerful one at that. If ordi-
nary investors wish to change the
fruits of their investments for the
better, then it is the money itself
that should be used as the lever. If
investments trend towards ethical
schemes a n d away from those
proven to be immoral, then you
can be d a m n sure that the banks
and investment agencies will be
falling over each other to provide
such opportunities.
True, most of us invest c o m -
paratively little, a n d hence our
leverage is small (but N O T negligi-
ble). This is why the success of the
'Ethical investment for the USS'
scheme (see page four) is such
g o o d news. Not only, does it have
the extra credence of being a state
investment scheme, but it also
packs a £ 1 3.5 billion punch. This is
more than a start - it is part of the
solution.
[Simon Baker would like it to be
known that he doesn't agree in the
slightest - see column]
