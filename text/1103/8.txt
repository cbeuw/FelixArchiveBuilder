E d i t o r i a l
It's a tragic irony that London,
the never-sleeping city that offers
so much in the way of entertain-
ment and social life can also be the
loneliest place on earth. Whether
you're stuck in a d a m p flat in one
of the rotting Victorian suburbs, or
a social prisoner in one of the
dispiriting college halls, L o n d o n
simply does not offer the social
and moral support of a community.
You only have to sit on a busy
underground carriage to experi-
ence this very real and deeply d a m -
aging fragmentation; a hundred fel-
low Londoners, united by a c o m -
mon need to travel somewhere,
but isolated to such a degree that
unsolicited eye contact is a minor
crime.
Faced with this intimidating
environment, students need sup-
port - they need it from their flat-
mates, their work colleagues and
their families, but most importantly
from their college. I a m well aware
that IC has s o m e excellent
resources; the College Tutors, the
Councillor, the Chaplains and the
Health Centre can all help. But
these all suffer from a fundamental
problem - they require the students
to go out an seek assistance t h e m -
selves and, as they say, w h e n you
realise that you've got a problem,
you're half way to solving it.
What college needs is an effec-
tive and committed system to look
after its students. It is not accept-
able to assign students work with-
out helping them to deal with the
stress caused. Sure, if a student
attends all their lectures and tutori-
als, then they are likely to cope
well. But what if they don't? Very
commonly, w h e n problems devel-
op, they easiest 'solution' is simply
not to turn up to college at all, at
which point all the normal support
systems fail totally. I know this,
because it happened to me. Stuck
in a lonely flat out in Stockwell in
my second year with no hope of
catching up my course, I simply
wasted time, not turning up for
weeks o n e n d . 1 could have had a
serious p r o b l e m , I might have
b e c o m e seriously ill, 1 could have
been broke and evicted or I might
have b e c o m e a drug addict. For all
my d e p a r t m e n t k n e w (and, it
seemed, cared) 1 might even have
been dead.
All it takes is to notice if a stu-
dent is having problems, or has
gone A W O L , and simply phone
them up, see h o w they are getting
on and find out if they need any
help. Positive action must be taken
to look after students, w h o are a
vulnerable and unusual group. They
are forced to deal with living inde-
pendently, an enormous workload,
surviving o n a pittance and dealing
with a traumatic stage of life all
simultaneously. Show them gen-
uine interest and care into their
well-being and progress, and you
will have a happy successful group
grappling with s o m e of life's
biggest challenges, and winning.
Carry on treating them as sta-
tistics on a league table and you
will have increased depression, a
high drop-out rate, increased drug
abuse and, as w e are seeing, even
suicide.
