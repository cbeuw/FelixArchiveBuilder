Dynasty
Warriors
O c e a n *
Let's face it, what
the w o r l d really
needs is another |
fighting g a m e for
the Playstation,
isn't it? Well, this appears to be
what the boys at O c e a n think and
so we have Dynasty Warriors. But
it's not another Tekken clone, o h
no - there are weapons (ooh), it
has lush high-resolution graphics
(aah) and - wait for it - the charac-
ters are based on 2nd and 3rd
century Chinese history (waheyl).
Seriously, this isn't really all that
bad. The graphics are rather
impressive - both fighters are
highly fluid and detailed, animation
is superb and the presentation as a
whole is great. Dynasty Warriors'
controls are ludicrously easy to
pick up, with t w o attack and t w o
defend buttons. A quick waggle of
the joypad and stabbing at buttons
results in a very slick set of moves
from the on-screen fighters. For
those w h o like things really easy,
special moves can be assigned to a
single button so that even your Dad
can pick up the game and have a
The one n o d to a d v a n c e d
gameplay is the 'special m o v e ' bar.
This is increased by aggressive play
and once fully charged, devastating
special moves can be unleashed.
These moves are not only the most
spectacular in the g a m e , they
should hopefully leave your foe
face-down on the floor. W h e n y o u
or your opponent are vanquished,
rather than the de facto s l o w
m o t i o n replay, a high o c t a n e
instant replay shows the killing
P E R I P H E R A L S
blow from four different angles in
quick succession. Completely gra-
tuitous and guaranteed to raise a
smile from the average violence-
addicted gameplayer.
Dynasty Warriors boasts all the
bells and whistles that are
expected from a modern fighter -
versus m o d e , endurance, team
battle, practice and a plethora of
options. A n d that's just about it -
what y o u see is most definitely
what you get. There's no real point
in playing the game for hours on
end, as there just aren't enough
c o m b o s and skills to be discov-
ered. The promise of three hidden
characters doesn't really extend
the longevity of the game.
However, if you want a fast
moving, gorgeous beat-em-up that
is face-meltingly easy to pick up
and enjoy, this is for y o u . Is it
worth spending forty quid on as
well as Tekken 2? N o . Is it worth
hiring for a night and getting pissed
whilst beating merry hell out of
your mates? Definitely. Did 1 laugh
out loud w h e n I first saw the action
replay? O h yes.

What is it?
It's the new Sony Playstation
Analog Controller.
What does it do then?
You see those big knobs in the
middle? Well, those are diddy
little analog joysticks. So you
have a greater degree of con-
trol.
What's the point of that?
If you're playing a 3D platform
game, then you can move in
any direction, rather than the
Jersey Devil
Ocean
Platform games have been a largely
untapped seam of gameplay on
modern 3D consoles - with the
exception of Crash Bandicoot and
Mario - but Ocean are hoping to
change this with Jersey Devil.
Claiming to have a non-linear
dynamic 3D environment, it aims
to be a true 3D platformer rather
than the restricted environments of
Pandemonium.
A highly amusing and excel-
lently animated opening movie sets
the scene, showing the evil M a d
Professor a i m i n g to take over
jersey with his army of mutant veg-
etables. (Sounds familiar? It will be,
as they've nicked the plot from
classic cheesy B movie "Attack of
the killer tomatoes"). O n l y the
enigmatic Jersey Devil can stand
against him.
The game's non-linear levels
predictably fail to arrive, with the
different levels available from the
town square in a strict order only.
This is exasperated by the need to
wander around until an entrance is
found, adding only extra frustration
and boredom to the game. This
could be excused, but for the next
flaw; although Jersey Devil is
eight available using the normal
direction pad. It's also g o o d for
flight simulators.
Does it do anything else?
It's also a normal controller - a
button on the front changes
between analog a n d digital
modes. So you can use it with
any game.
What's the catch?
Games have to be written to
support it - you'll find an
'Analog Controller' icon on the
back of games that do. At the
equipped with wings, and can float
d o w n safely from heights, all too
often the player is presented with
levels chock full of teeny weeny
platforms above a gaping abyss.
Falling into one of these results in
an immediate loss of life, much to
the annoyance of the poor game-
player. This is platform tactics from
the M a n i c M i n e r s c h o o l , and
shouldn't be found in a modern
game - especially on the first level,
when the player is still becoming
accustomed to the irritating c a m -
era angles and unsubtle controls.
Strong character design, a w o n -
derfully haunting and atmospheric
soundtrack and the wacky cartoon-
like world help to entice the player
into the game. Unfortunately, this
is all wasted as the increasingly
frustrating gameplay and puzzles
w h i c h have seemingly r a n d o m
solutions rob the player of all will to
carry o n . Jersey Devil fails to live up
to its promises and is ultimately an
unsatisfying game.

m o m e n t there aren't that many
(Jersey Devil, reviewed above,
supports it).
Is it any good then?
It works very well - the con-
troller is a bit bigger, so it fits in
your hand well. It does depend
on the game to some extent,
though.
How much does it cost?
You should find it for £ 2 5 in
most shops. That's about £ 1 0
more than the standard con-
troller.
