THE SILVER CASTLE
Clive James
" You can stand aloof from the
sufferings of the world; you are
free to do so and it expresses
your nature; but perhaps that very
aloofness is the one suffering you
might have avoided." -Kafka.
B
orn on the pavements of
Bombay, Sanjay is an unusu-
ally beautiful child. H i s cute
look and soulful gaze gave h i m an
advantage over those begging for
the same food that w a s needed to
survive. Begging is all part of having
the right look a n d Sanjay had that.
At the age of seven, he wanders
away for a while a n d finds himself
at what he believes to be a silver
castle. U n k n o w n t o him, he is o n
the set of a major Bollywood film.
Finding himself in favour one day,
he is thrown off the set the next.
He is beaten by his father for stray-
ing but the m e m o r y of the silver
castle a n d the beautiful princess
stays indelibly stamped in Sanjay's
mind a n d both b e c o m e an obses-
sion from then o n .
The novel takes us through
Sanjay's life. H e becomes both an
adept beggar and once he is n o
longer seen as a small child, devel-
ops into a skilful thief, changing his
allegiance to different gangs. Soon,
he graduates into a guide for TV
crews a n d then into the rent-boy
trade in which he gains the favour
of o n e particular middle-aged m a n
who buys h i m a cheap room. H e
also attends a special school run by
volunteers once a week. It is obvi-
ous that Sanjay is intelligent a n d he
picks up English quite quickly
although, comically, not quite
understanding its irony in certain
situations. Throughout, Sanjay is
obsessed with the film world a n d
reads all the magazines a n d goes
to the cinema as often as possible.
Soon he finds himself catapulted
into its world and far from the lowly
pavement. However, in the e n d it
all crumbles away a n d Sanjay finds
himself without the favours he had
previously relied o n . Clive James
has proved himself a skilful writer
with this commentary o n Bombay
and the Indian film industry. H e
also shows his sensitivity as w e find
ourselves caring about Sanjay a n d
what happens to h i m because he
has only really been brought up in
the w a y o f the street. It would be
easy in a story like this to analyse
Sanjay's character in a detached
way. It w o u l d be easy to attach his
downfall to his inherent amorality.
It w o u l d be easy to call this a trag-
ic-comic story a n d throw Sanjay
into the long list of tragic heroes
including M a c b e t h and Lea/ w h o
had but o n e flaw that could not be
reconciled. However, this is the
very aloofness James is encourag-
ing us t o avoid. Sanjay is real. H e
exists. Y o u will no doubt see him
and look into his ruined eyes, one
day. Whether y o u recognise him is
for you to decide.

THE CUT
Daniel Blythe
T
his is not an easy book. It is an extremely
well written, fast paced, well plotted book
with excellently drawn, deeply unsympa-
thetic characters. It's written through the eyes of
Bel, a nice, well-educated middle-class girl,
brought up in a seaside t o w n somewhere o n the
South Coast. She is also a sadistic, cruel bitch,
without a spark of humanity, w h o believes her-
self to be above things such as kindness and tol-
erance. She is the proud owner of a small, slim
deadly w e a p o n : a flick-knife. Bel's just finished
her A-levels, a n d n o w feels trapped in Suburbia.
She really wants to get out, but she's bored a n d
can't be bothered to change things. To relieve
her boredom, she goes to parties, to clubs, joy-
riding, shoplifting, takes drugs and has sex in
churches. She also sleeps with someone for a
hundred pounds.
Her mother died w h e n she w a s fifteen, a n d
some of her attitude problems stem from that.
But she's u n c o m p r o m i s i n g a n d doesn't attempt
to justify her behaviour at all. She doesn't want
your pity, or post-Freudian psycho-analysis, she
just does what she does because she wants to.
Nothing Bel ever does seems to be right for
the type of family she c o m e s from. Due to her
father's wealth a n d status, no-one ever suspects
her or her rather dubious friends, even when
they ram-raid a few shops, steal C D s a n d
destroy thousands of pounds worth of goods.
Suspicion always falls o n the kids from the
rough e n d of town, the Fallies. These people
naturally become their enemies, a n d they get
The Cut - not the sort of book to cheer
youself up with, really.
into lots of fights with them. O n e night, howev-
er, things g o horribly wrong, as someone is
killed by the stolen car they're driving. Bel's
world spirals out of control a n d she finds that
her so-called friends, including her boyfriend,
will betray her time a n d time again.
I really liked this book. Bel is a nasty, c o m -
pletely believable character: I have a friend w h o
is a bit like her in many ways, a n d I can see ele-
ments of her in myself as well. O f course, I'm
not a knife-wielding psycho, totally devoid of all
human feeling, but there are some things that
she does that I've sometimes contemplated
doing. 1 w a s fairly bewildered by the title, The
Cut, but it apparently refers to the day when Bel
will stab s o m e o n e with her flick-knife a n d kill
them. It's a state of mind, an assertion - as I said
this isn't an easy read.
I r e c o m m e n d this book t o anyone w h o grew
up bored in a small town, to anyone who's ever
really wanted to kill the person they hate most
and anyone who's ever thought that nice mid-
dle-class girls couldn't possibly ever behave like
complete yobs. You are s o wrong.
It's not really a book to give your granny
though.
