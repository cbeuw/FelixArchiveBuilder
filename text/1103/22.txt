THOUGHT FOR THE DAY:
Hello, hello...
6 January 1998
"Now I'll transfer £ 2 , 0 0 0 from
Union funds into your
account..." Ali and Jeremy get
caught on security camera while
supposedly laying out the first
issue...
W :
' elcome t o all! Folk w h o
have avoided death by
Chicken Flu or CJD will be
able t o observe that the population
of turkeys is beginning to return t o
its pre-Christmas level, a n d those
few feathered fowls still remaining
will be appreciating the resultant
fall in their life-insurance premi-
ums. Similarly, the population of IC
is returning t o its pre-Christmas
level. I a m naturally disappointed
to discover that there is still no
turkey here. I sincerely hope every-
one enjoyed the break; let's all be
glad that it wasn't another frugal
Sherfield two-weeker. O n c e again,
solemn N e w Year's resolutions will
be swapped earnestly in the dark
depths of Southside Bar. N o n e will
be kept, least of all the ones about
"going to all lectures this year", or
any containing the words "teetotal"
or "drugs". 1 a m going to ignore any
correspondence pointing out that
this includes more than o n e of m y
N e w Year's resolutions.
There are s o m e things a r o u n d
Imperial I a m sure everyone has
missed. Students returning t o Hall
will be glad of the simplicity of
drunken swipe-card entry, rather
than the significantly more complex
mental computation required t o
operate a set of keys a n d a Yale
lock. The intrepid Felix crew are rel-
ishing a return to cheap curries,
cheap computers, an extremely
cheap collator, a n d the all-pervad-
ing smell of cheap litho ink. Three
or four students might appreciate a
return to second-order differential
equations, a n d the rest will wish t o
re-affirm their love of Southside
Bar, a n d remind themselves that,
yes, the beer really is that cheap.
Personally, 1 a m looking forward to
a second term reminiscent of that
in the first year; work, counselling,
painful relationship trauma,
impending failure, missed lectures,
therapy by alcoholic oblivion. A s
Gary Glitter once prophesied: "It's
g o o d t o be back."
Hands u p all the freshers w h o have
not joined any Clubs or Societies
yet. T o o busy drinking, huh? Didn't
that term fly by? You are going to
look quite silly next year w h e n
there is no hall bar t o p o p into. Plus
you will probably have decided that
you hate all the people with w h o m
you are sharing the draughty flat in
Brixton, especially if one of them is
now making a move o n your sweet-
heart. M y advice is t o pick a club or
society. D i d I mention that Felix
needs a n e w sports editor?
