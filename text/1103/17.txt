Dreamscape (Vol.2) - The Vision
T
his bumper 3 C D pack, cover-
ing h a p p y hardcore, o l d
skool 8. jungle (D&B). From
the people w h o s e e m e d to almost
invent the rave scene, setting the
standard from the beginning. For
those of y o u w h o k n o w of
Dreamscape I needn't say (write)
much, as y o u ' l l k n o w what to
expect. Shit-hot Dj's d r o p p i n g
massive tunes a n d value for
money.
For those w h o don't it's safe to
say that Dreamscape have been
putting o n s o m e of the very best
'raves' over the past seven years.
O n a truly massive scale, giving
value for money, top quality pro-
duction and of course the best Dj's
& M C ' s in the world. W h e r e ten's
of thousands of party people have
had the time of their lives.
These 3 C D ' s capture this spirit
excellently, using Dj's that have
been tried and tested at
Dreamscape events, they're almost
residence.
Disk 1. Vibes keeps the 4-beat,
happy hardcore c o m i n g at ya like
only he can on disk 1. Dropping
such tracks as Venus Sound of
Love, Vibes & S e d u c t i o n Free
Yourself & Visa Fly Away.
Disk 2. M i c k y Finn, one of the
most consistently on-it Dj's you'll
ever find and one of my favourites.
Like all the Dj's featured, he's been
there f r o m the beginning. I've
heard this m a n d o the most amaz-
ing things with two decks and a
mixer in the most difficult of condi-
tions. Respect. Things are started
off w i t h that bad-arse Urban
Takover remix of The Jungle
Brothers Jungle Brother. You get
the idea of h o w things are going to
carry o n : fat, fat bass-lines, crazy
a m e n breaks, jump-up D & B at it's
best. With the lyrical wizardry of
M C G Q another of my favourites
and undoubtedly one of the best
after C o n r a d . You're set for a non
stop ride o n that D & B aeroplane.
Rounding things off is Jason
Kaye, one half of T o p B u z z taking us
back to the days when he, M i k e y B
& Patrick rocked the place o n many
many occasions as the T o p B u z z
collective. All 15 tracks are classics
and mixed together like only some-
one with JK's experience and skill
can. Some of the tracks featured
are: Altern8 Infiltrate 202, Bizarre
Inc with Such A Feeling, T o p B u z z
Living In Darkness etc.
With all three of these C D ' s (if
you've been there before), y o u can
just sit back close your eyes and
you're there. Standing in a throng
of people, music crystal clear, the
lights going crazy and an atmos-
phere of peace, love ' n ' harmony.
These C D s brought back many a
m e m o r y from great times gone by.
Even if you've never been or even
heard of Dreamscape before it is
still well worth checking, giving a
comprehensive view of truly origi-
nal underground dance music. LTLcl

Those generous p e o p l e at
Phuture Trax have given us two
copies to give away to y o u lucky
people. All y o u need to d o is
answer the following question:
Where was the first
Dreamscape event held ?

ANDY LEWIS
UK GARAGE FEVER •
T
his is probably the best
mixed garage C D out at the
moment, truly capturing the
vibe & styles of the clubs ' n ' pirate
stations of L o n d o n . N o cheese, no
fillers just 13 fat 'n' fresh floor
stormers, many still unreleased.
The involved mixing by A n d y Lewis
is a nice change from the fade-in
fade-out styles of mixing normal ly
found on this sort of mix C D s . It
actually sounds as if he is mixing
and cutting the records and not as
if a computer is doing it all, as I'm
sure many of these mix C D ' s are
produced.
Things are set rolling with
M a t l o k ' s Rocket, a wicked tune
and it's just gets better from here
o n . Fat b-line after fat b-line rolls in
with tunes such as David Anthony's
Anticipating, Banana Republic's
Catch The Feeling (one of the best
tunes of 9 7 ' for me) and Baffled
Republic's a w e s o m e Bad Boys
(Move in Silence) to name but a
few.
So if y o u want to find out what
this underground garage / house
thing is all about then check this
one out. It is also a must for those
w h o know.
To see Andy Lewis flexing his
mixing skills live 'n' direct you can
catch the m a n at EC1 club, Peach
@ C a m d e n Palace and Cookies &
Cream @ Base. E H Jo Public
DREEM TEEM
IN SESSIONS (VOL 2) • • • •
T
his mixed compilation, like
many of the big name house
compilations, lacks any excit-
ing mixing and pretty m u c h just
gets the mix in and keeps it there
for a while before fading it out
without any cutting of the records.
That said there are no mash ups
and it all rolls along nicely. But as
the Dreem Teem is made up of
three p e o p l e , M i c k y B (from
T o p B u z z fame), Timmy M a g i c &
Spoony, what did they d o - play a
couple of tunes each?
A strong selection of tracks
has been m a d e with the likes of
Amira's Desire, RIP's Rip Groove,
S o m o r e ' s / Refuse and Scott
Garcia's It's A London Thing all
featured. I though it a tad modest
putting their o w n tune, The Theme,
on there twice albeit in two differ-
ent mixes.
These three boys are making
big noises in the house/garage
world and I can see why. They have
been around from the start, and
pioneered what has been come to
be k n o w n as Speed Garage by the
media but what they would call it,
as w o u l d I, is just Underground
Garage, combining jungle b-lines
and structures with garage beats
and b p m .
O n e of the best garage c o m p i -
lation you'll find, showing the UK
club scene as it really is with no
fillers, just quality underground
cuts. E E
