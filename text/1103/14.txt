ell. It w a s g o o d . . . b u t
they told m e not to say
just that, so I will have to
elaborate, I guess. Arrival in Brixton
was met by the usual barrage from
touts... tempted to sell the tickets
and run... no, grab s o m e dinner of
dubious nutritional value and in.
Defenders of liberty may balk as
their ticket is scanned and arrival is
registered. Still, not to worry, we're
in.
O n e support act lost to arrival
time, another to vain attempts to
procure anything other than a
generic 'beer' from the bar. The one
actually witnessed was quite unex-
pected. A quintet of people in
Teflon hats attempt to o u t d o each
other with their new break-dancing
moves. S o m e m o v e s that were
obviously pretty tricky, others that
were pretty plain and others that
just went wrong. Still, it did serve to
focus the audience's attention for
the imminent arrival of the main
act. With two second-hand experi-
ences of the Prodigy live - booed
off the stage in M u n i c h last year
and in top form in a previous
appearance at Brixton - I wasn't
completely sure how well it would
go. The general m o o d was very
positive though.
Eventually they're on and the
full splendour of their industrial
stage set is revealed for the first
time. Straight into Smack My Bitch
Up with the video-they-tried-to-
ban (err, that'll be the video-they-
did-ban) projected onto the video
walls, volume at expected thresh-
old-of-deafness levels, lights on
brink of inducing epilepsy and the
perfect c r o w d response. They con-
tinue through a broad selection of
new and old with only one flaw, the
feeling that it was too m u c h like just
any gig, with the band at the front
and decreasing grades of moshing
out from the stage. This slight
doubt was instantly dispelled as
Keith made an impromptu appear-
ance on the lighting control place in
the midst of the c r o w d . Two secu-
rity guards flanked him constantly,
preventing any suicidal c r o w d surf-
ing. The cynic in me said that this
stunt served its premeditated pur-
p o s e very well, rejuvenating a
slightly flagging concert and split-
ting attention sufficiently to the
atmosphere a bit closer to that of a
club.
Later still, after the completely
predictable encore - why d o they
bother? - the D| returned and there
seemed to be no forced rush to
leave, a refreshing change. Except ,
that is,for the departure of last tube
which s e e m e d to draw away a
rather large share of the audience...
