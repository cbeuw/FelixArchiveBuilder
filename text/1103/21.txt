FIRST LIGHT
Richard Preston
Hale and his two-hundred inch telescope
BOOKS
F
irst Light is the 'cult' 1987 book by Richard
Preston, author of The Hot Zone. N o w in a
n e w edition, it is the story of the
astronomers at the Hale Telescope at Palomar
Mountain, Southern California. The telescope
was built by George Hale in the 1930s and is the
largest working telescope on Earth, with a mirror
two hundred inches in diameter. It is housed in
a massive d o m e , looking like "Hollywood's idea
of a M a y a n temple." The astronomers here are
searching for light from the edge of the universe
and their lives and work are described in metic-
ulous detail. The book centres on the distin-
guished astronomer Professor James E. Gunn of
Princeton. Other important characters are the
senior night assistant Juan Carrasco, the
American astronomer Donald Schneider, the
Dutch astronomer Maarten Schmidt and Eugene
and Carolyn Shoemaker, now famous for finding
the comet that bore their name. The book is full
of fascinating facts, including certain names of
asteroids and planets: Lucifer, Tolkein,
Mr.Spock, Swissair, Retsina (the Greek wine)
and Transylvania. Preston wrote the book by
observing the astronomers first hand for the
period of the story, "like Jane Goodall a m o n g the
chimpanzees." This has created a book more
akin to a novel than a work of non-fiction; in the
introduction Preston admits that he did not
intend for this to be a science book. However, a
book about scientists is obviously going to have
a lot of science in it. This mixture of soap and
science does, in this case, work very well.
Although not quite 'Eastenders' it shows that
astronomers can be exciting. This approach is a
subtle one but is effective in explaining the sci-
ence involved and making the subject entertain-
ing, although this was not the primary objective
of the book. It is a very g o o d introduction to the
subject to people with little knowledge on
astronomy. It is still useful to experts from the
insights it gives into the lives of professional sci-
entists and interesting to those w h o have no
interest in the actual science from the way in
which it works as a straight novel. It is a read-
able and extremely accessible book.
