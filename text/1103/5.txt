Dear Felix,
Another year, more stuff from
Mark.
I hope y o u all enjoyed the
Christmas Bond Carnival, it was
g o o d to see so many sophisticated
outfits.
But I'm afraid one of y o u took
espionage a little bit too far by
stealing the prize B M W from the
casino, and w e ' d really like to get it
back for the person w h o legiti-
mately w o n it. So if you've sobered
up, or your conscience is bugging
you, y o u could just drop it off at
Beit or Sherfield Security, or in the
Union and no further action will be
taken.
But it's not all complaining, I've
also got to tell y o u that dBs has
now been fitted out with a new 10
foot video screen for all the big
s p o r t i n g events, (and The
Simpsons!!) so your viewing plea-
sure will be complete. See the
adverts for all the details of what
we'll be showing.
A n d , just to prove there is a
long term plan at work, the initial
planning phases for the proposed
extension to dBs are beginning to
take shape. If all the work takes
place, as of next October ICU will
possess one of the biggest and the
newest venues in L o n d o n . Watch
Felix for details.
W e hope y o u • enjoy all the
events and stuff we've got lined up
for y o u this term, to help y o u take
your mind off all those exams.
Cheers

Dear felix,
the sort of observation-deduc-
tion science W e s Hinsley uses in
his Alternative Science article is, in
your opinion, worthy of a double
page spread. The obvious flaws in
his arguments could cover a double
edition.
Apart from the downright lies
about "scientific evidence favouring
special creation by g o d " Wes, with
the help of the equally barking Dr
Gish, create a stunningly absurd
"demand" for a Creator by refer-
ence to the Bombardier Beetle.
Not only does he display his palpa-
ble lack of understanding of h o w
evolution is proposed to work (a
slight drawback w h e n trying to
argue against something) but his
own arguments in favour of cre-
ationism are so weak that if g o d
existed he'd surely be squirming
with embarrassment right now. The
one doubt W e s raises in my mind is
how natural selection could have
possibly produced him.
1 have no objection at all to dif-
ferent points of view, but I d o mas-
sively object to y o u printing an arti-
cle this weak, which has no coher-
ent argument and spreads disinfor-
mation a n d m i s u n d e r s t a n d i n g ,
surely Imperial isn't the place to be
pandering to this sort of reac-
tionary bullshit?
yours astonishingly pissed-
offedly,
Anon biochemist.
PS. O o p s ! I forgot to point out
all those flaws! I was having such a
g o o d go at W e s that it slipped my
m i n d completely, o h well, lets
wade through the bullshit and point
out the smelliest bits:
"Not one theory about evolu-
tion has been scientifically proven."
-You wascally wabbit W e s , even
you know that scientific theories
don't prove things, merely reflect
best what evidence is available,
evolution does this, so of course it
isn't proof.
"The spontaneous generation
of a living organism is impossible."
- O h really Wes? any evidence for
that? Didnt think so. no matter, y o u
just go ahead and state it anyway.
"An amoeba in s o m e 'primeval
soup'." Not true W e s , amoebas
c a m e much later, never mind, we'll
let y o u have that one.
" A m o e b a . . . b e c a m e a m a n ,
w o m a n , cactus etc while simulta-
neously remaining an a m o e b a all
that time." Wes, that w o u l d be
tricky indeed, but as y o u know, it is
proposed that w e have c o m m o n
ancestors with all other living
organisms, not that we necessari-
ly evolve from them.
"This...flies in the face of...the
law of entropy." Wes, thats bol-
locks! living organisms rely, ulti-
mately, on the sun as a source of
energy, the system is not closed.
At this point, W e s starts crapping
about lots of things; I've got work
to do, I'm sorry. I hate to leave at
this point, but I hope I've made the
point. Please dont let W e s Hinsley
anywhere near us again.
Dear Felix,
I strongly protest against you
printing fundamentalist creation-
ism masking as 'a scientific alterna-
tive to evolution'. It's always the
same stragey: get s o m e quotes
about the (real) gaps in our under-
standing of the evolutionary history
of life on Earth, put in a few quotes
from s o m e physicists and material
scientists (who usually have very
little understanding of the issue)
and then offer g o d as the solution
to the p r o b l e m . M a i n s t r e a m
churches are very happy to accept
an evolutionary interpretation of
life and creationism is just a throw-
back to a prescientific dark age and
has no explanatory value whatso-
ever.
Don't let Felix b e c o m e a vehicle
for weirdos to propagate their anti-
scientific m e d i e v a l p s e u d o a r g u -
ments!!!
Best wishes,
Dr. Robert O.J. Weinzierl
Dear Felix,
I'm sure y o u already got truck-
loads of letters about this article on
creationism. Here's mine. I react as
a scientist, not as a christian or an
atheist: I will never know whether
G o d created the world or not,
because if H e d i d . He could create
as well all sorts of evidences and
counter-evidences to prove this or
that. H e could even create the
world by evolution (I don't deny
that the present state of nature is a
miracle). However, what I know is
that there is really few science in
this article despite the way it's writ-
ten, so few it is worrying, c o m i n g
from Imperial College.
Let's begin with the main argu-
ment: there is little evidence to
show that w e evolved, therefore
w e probably did not. This is an
insult to basic logic and I won't
c o m m e n t . O n e could say that the
evidence for the creationist theory
is very small as well: one book,
