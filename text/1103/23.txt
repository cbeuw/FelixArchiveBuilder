INSIGNIFICANCE
Terry Johnson
Can you guess who it is yet?
M
y self-imposed holiday
task w a s to write a pre-
view of DramSoc's pro-
duction of this play. This w a s actu-
ally a lot harder than I'd anticipat-
ed, since I've not seen a perfor-
mance, a n d so I've no idea h o w it
will be staged. I've heard that it's
going to be dramatic a n d spectac-
ular with a "big effect" at the e n d .
Having read the play, I n o w know
that this is a tragic c o m e d y about
knowledge, Relativity, understand-
ing a n d the poignancy of human
relationships.
There are four characters: the
Professor, the Actress, the
Ballplayer a n d the Senator. The
Actress is married to the Ballplayer,
and it's their failing relationship
that is the tragedy of the play. The
characters represent real figures, I
won't tell y o u w h o they are, just
that it's set in America in 1953 at
the time of the anti-Communist
terrors. The States were gripped by
the type of mass hysteria usually
only expressed by m o u r n i n g
nations.
Knowledge is nothing without
understanding. Knowledge is not
truth, it is merely agreement. You
cannot understand by making defi-
nitions, only by turning over the
possibilities. It's called thinking.
The Actress has just explained
the Professor's Specific Theory of
Relativity t o h i m , but she only
knows the General Theory by heart.
Knowledge, however, is far, far
more than mere parrot-like repeti-
tion. She doesn't understand it.
O n e of the main themes of the play
is the conflict between knowledge
and understanding, each character
representing a different angle to
these supposedly complimentary
ideas. These concepts are usually
assumed to g o together hand in
hand, but the play highlights h o w
we often misinterpret one for the
other in love, life and science.
The Actress loves her husband
in a way he'll never understand. H e
wants to possess her, to o w n her.
She wants him as a counterbalance
to her o w n feelings of confusion,
to her o w n insecurity. H e seems
so secure, so right in what he is and
knows: he's an all American boy, a
gum-chewing, hard-hitting, W o r l d
Series w i n n i n g baseball player.
He's also stupid.
You remember my first orgasm?
Yep.
Afterwards I lay in the dark,
utterly exhausted, hoping you
might light me a cigarette, and
what did I hear? Pop. That's all I
hear now, pathetic little explosions,
that's all you give me.
You want a divorce?
So stupid that he works at his
stupidity, building it u p as a barrier
between him a n d her, a barrier that
could eventually destroy o n e of
them or their marriage.
Their inability to grasp each
other's ideas of knowledge a n d
understanding only help to c o m p l i -
cate their lives - a problem not
faced by the Senator. H i s assured
confidence in life, aided by his
solipsistic outlook that everyone
only exists in his mind, enables him
to destroy without conscience both
the life a n d work of the Professor.
Ain't difficult once you've sold
you soul. My orders are to find his
work, take it and sit on it. Then I
get a call and I hand it back or I
shred the damn thing. I've given a
great deal of thought as to the
importance of these documents
and I came to the conclusion that
the shape of Space/Time is of fuck-
all importance to any of us. It's just
paper, otherwise why would he
throw it all away?
It's this "ignorance" that scares
the Professor because it lacks true
understanding.
Smallness happens and alone-
ness happens but the miracle is
that insignificance doesn't happen.
The stars tell us we can walk on the
grass, talk to anyone we meet,
touch these people, ask anything of
them; the stars won't think the
worst of us. The stars won't even
notice.
Insignificance. Don't be fooled
by the title. This play will force you
to think, to question your o w n
knowledge. H o w m u c h d o y o u
know? H o w m u c h is received wis-
d o m ? H o w m u c h is genuine c o m -
prehension? H o w m u c h can y o u
explain? Everyone at Imperial
College can benefit from this play.
G o a n d see it. I can't wait t o . D

25 YEARS IN PAINTING
Alex Katz
A
lex Katz is an American artist
of considerable skill. H i s
work is heavily influenced by
the late Renaissance school, espe-
cially artists such as Tintoretto a n d
Veronese. H e is exhibiting for the
first time in the UK. Unlike many of
his contempories, such as N o r m a n
Rockwell a n d Andy Warhol, Alex
Katz has never been pigeonholed
into any particular category. H e
could never be classified as a P o p
Artist. H e is almost unique in his
treatment of his subjects. The only
artist I can think of w h o seems to
express the same love for his m o d -
els is Anthony Green, a British
artist, now living in Cambridgeshire.
Like Green, Katz prefers to paint his
family, mainly his wife a n d son.
O n e of his best known works is
"The Red Smile", his wife laughing.
Although not o n display, this is a
truely beautiful painting. But Alex
Katz's work is beautiful. It's full of
perfectly formed all-American boys
and girls, but it's cool, in a terribly
N e w York sort of way. It's the
same cool as Count Basie, as L o u
Reed a n d as Andy Warhol.
The Saatchi Gallery is itself
amazing. It's white. Stark white.
This really highlights the vivid
colours of Katz's work. According
to h i m , his work is both abstract
and figurative. I think that by this
he means that they express real
things in an unrealistic manner.
W h e n I spoke to him, he told m e
that his work is meant to be optical,
by which I think he meant that his
paintings were not to be analysed
too deeply, that they were
designed to appeal, rather than to
be intellectualised.
The last Saatchi collection w a s
the truely horrendous Sensation,
d i s m e m b e r e d c o w s , e m b a l m e d
sharks and other works by British
"artists". This time, however
Charles Saatchi has spent his
money wisely on one of the best
artists in America today. G o a n d
see this exhibition, it is s t u n n i n g . E l
