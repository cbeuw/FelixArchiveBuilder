MORE LETTERS 16 January 1998
w h o s e author is
u n k n o w n . It's rather a
question of balance.
The argument about
entropy shows a deep misunder-
standing of the very bases of ther-
modynamics. The Earth is not a
closed system.
But evolution is a matter of
fact: for example, in the short peri-
o d since the invention of antibi-
otics, bacterias have b e c o m e resis-
tant to them on such a large scale
that it may soon b e c o m e a real
public health problem. Biologists
studying these resistant bacterias
are surprised by the number of
techniques they have developed.
All this, I recall, over less than fifty
years. This, as other observations,
proves beyond doubt that evolu-
tion is currently at work in our
world. N o w remains this other
question, can w e extrapolate such
small mutations within a species to
the evolution from bacteria to man
and bombardier beetle? This is a
big leap. Considering the scale of
time involved and the similarities
between species d i s c o v e r e d by
Darwin, evolutionists say, it makes
perfect sense. N o proof, I agree,
but it makes sense.
The extensive example of the
bombardier beetle is completely
flawed: the author tries to c o n -
struct it as an engineer, by putting
the pieces together in a certain
order with the purpose of the final
result. This is precisely a creationist
view. Evolution wouldn't work like
that: living beings are full of useless
bits and bobs, and a small mutation
may make a huge difference by
bringing s o m e of these c o m p o -
nents to a new use. The order of
apparition of the different parts of
the bombardier beetle can't obvi-
ously be the one described, but it
doesn't have to be this order.
Then from the theological point
of view, G o d wouldn't let us prove
that H e exists, even by dismantling
beetles.
N o w for the really bad thing in
this article. S o m e people also say
"there is little evidence that the gas
chambers were actually used to kill
jews, therefore they d i d not". This
comparison is a little bit harsh, but
it makes t w o points: First, of course
there is little evidence for the gas
chambers: the Jews there were
killed and burned all but a few, so
you'll get only a little evidence. It is
the same for those missing links,
which you take as a proof of cre-
ation: in the evolution theory they
disappeared under evolution pres-
sure, and it takes an awful lot of
luck to leave a fossil behind. This
doesn't prove the theory, of course,
but it proves its consistency.
Second, any argument negating
scientific (or historical) research is
dangerous for the truth. I mean
that I prefer believing in evolution-
ism, because there is a lot of
research left to d o (as the article
shows), than in creationism which
denies the need for science to dis-
cover the truth. That's my scientific
religion, and it's not atheism.
Similarly 1 prefer believing that the
gas chambers existed, because it
makes me vigilant about the future.
W e can't hope to prove any-
thing about the evolution theory
with only one single sample of evo-
lution. Science needs to make
experiments, but w e can't afford to
wait the millions of years needed
for serious ones. That is the only
real argument for those w h o want
this field of knowledge to rely on
faith rather than science.

Open letter to Southside Security
I would like to thank them for
their kindness towards m e last
term. I know that it is traditional for
Felix to be rude about them, but
they d i d far, far more than neces-
sary o n this occasion. After a rather
alcoholic evening, I was waiting for
a night bus by the Albert Hall when
I was approached by a strange
man, and followed back to the
Prince's Gardens Halls of
Residence. The Security guards not
only p h o n e d the police, they also
took me home, which since 1 live in
Fulham, is not in anybody's way.I
a m extremely grateful to them,
they really reassured me,and never
m a d e me feel like a waste of
time.Thanks guys.

Chemistry 2Dear Felix,

Dear Felix
Your editorial "Mind Your O w n
Business" in the 1 7 December Felix
puts forward views that cannot go
unchallenged.
As I a m sure both y o u and your
readers are aware, the possession,
use or supply of illegal drugs such
as cannabis, is an offence under the
Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 and is
also an offence against College and
Hall regulations. Although the
police often deal with such cases
by a "caution", this cannot be
assumed as it will d e p e n d on cir-
cumstances and the penalties o n
conviction in a criminal court can
be severe. What you may not be
familiar with is that the same Act
also makes it an offence for the
College to permit anyone to use or
possess illegal drugs on premises
for which it has responsibility or
control; the word "permit" includes
"turning a blind eye" to drug mis-
use. So the College takes a serious
view of drug misuse on c a m p u s
and all cases are taken to a Student
Residence Tribunal as well as being
referred to the local police. In a few
cases the police have prosecuted
and severe penalties have in fact
been i m p o s e d by Magistrate and
Crown Courts.
There is m u c h public discussion
nowadays about de-criminalising
recreational use of cannabis.
Irrespective of the rights a n d
wrongs of that debate, within the
present law w e have a clear legal
duty not to permit or condone its
use o n campus. M y o w n conversa-
tions with students w h o have used
cannabis, makes me believe that
there are effects on students (e.g.
short term m e m o r y loss) of fre-
quent cannabis use which could
harm their academic work and doc-
tors have told me that there are
risks (1 put it no higher as it
depends on the individual) of other
harmful effects o n health. It is also
m u c h debated whether frequent
cannabis use brings risks of being
introduced to other m u c h more
harmful Class A drugs, mainly
through contact with unscrupulous
suppliers. There are a lot of people
in all big cities w h o make large
amounts of m o n e y from supplying
illegal drugs and w h o care nothing
for the harm they cause their "cus-
tomers" and w h o resort to violence
to protect their trade.
With regard to s o m e of the
other points y o u made, Wardens
are in a better position to respond
than 1 a m but I can say that clean-
ers are not used as spies and it is a
slur on t h e m to refer to them in this
way. A s regards security guards
patrolling corridors in Beit after
recent fire alarms, this was for a
very g o o d reason concerned with
the protection and safety of stu-
dents.
Yours sincerely,
Dr Gareth Jones, College Tutor
