RENAI ANCE
Civilization declined after the fall of the Roman Empire. Little of substance was contributed to
the spheres of science, philosophy or art for over a millennium. Then, shining out from the Dark
Ages, came the Renaissance. Julia Harries enlightens us further...
The Renaissance was the beginning
of a new way of looking at the world,
embracing politics, poetry, painting,
sculpture, science, religion, architec-
ture and music.
The heart of the Renaissance w a s Italy, a n d
in particular Florence. A t the time, Italy
consisted of many city states, each with
their o w n government, a n d laws. The
Florentine rulers were republicans, the
M e d i c i family, wealthy bankers a n d gener-
ous patrons of the arts. Florence, even
without it's art, is one of the most beauti-
ful cities in the world. The view of the
cathedral must rank as o n e of the most
famous a n d best loved in the world. E . M .
Forster even wrote a book about it.

Until the fifteenth century, Florentine Art
had been dominated by the heavily sym-
bolic school of Flamboyant Gothic. These
were extremely beautiful paintings, with
limited subjects, a n d the personality of the
painter w a s never expressed in the work.
Everything w a s done to further the glory of
G o d . Artists such as Gentile d a Fabriano
produced really beautiful pictures, all with
the same subject, always in the same style.
This was work of great charm, rich in inven-
tion, a n d filled with sweetly seductive
images, dreamy harmony, a n d only a
superficial use of form and space. There
was little true perspective - these were
Iconistic paintings. By breaking away from
conventions, Renaissance artists were able
to portray the Holy Family as people, with
the events from the Bible being set in the
Tuscan countryside. This painting of the
M a d o n n a , jesus and John by Raphael,
shows Leonardo's influence, and depicts
what would have been familiar landscape
to everyone w h o s a w it. This is a long way
from the heavily stylised Gothic pictures.
Fra Filippo Lippi's portrait of M a r y a n d
Jesus shows the Renaissance development
of perspective. The important thing about
CJuomo, Florence
this picture is that the focus is not the Holy
Family, it is the cliff path leading to a
church, with the distance is clearly repre-
sented by perspective. Art changed from
simple Iconistic Gothic painting to the
recreation of Nature in itself, with M a n as
the centre point, not G o d .
The myths of the Ancient Greeks and
R o m a n s were revised, a n d used by
painters, especially Botticelli. This painting,
perhaps his most famous, shows the birth
of Venus at Cyprus. With her serene looks,
and long flowing hair, she has c o m e to
symbolise the renaissance, a n d in particu-
lar the Florentine style. Her face can be
seen in many paintings including the M o n a
Lisa a n d countless M a d o n n a s .
