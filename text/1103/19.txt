BRING ME THE HEAD OF MAVIS DAVIS
Starring: Rik Mayall, Jane Horrocks -kit
Director: John Henderson
T
hose of y o u w h o found the
h u m o u r of B o t t o m c o n -
cerned too often with bodily
functions will be relieved to learn
that M a r t y Starr, M a y a l l ' s charac-
ter in Mavis Davis has far m o r e to
do with his earlier creation, Alan
B'stard. While the schemings of a
Tory minister are no longer t o p i -
cal, the idea of a music producer
manufacturing a p o p career are
far from fanciful. The singer in
question is the e p o n y m o u s
Mavis, played by Jane H o r r o c k s ,
but she is reluctant to acknowl-
e d g e M a r t y Starr's help. His
thankless task b e c o m e s m o r e
d e m a n d i n g w h e n M a v i s ' popular-
ity begins to flag. W h e n we join
Marty, he is d o w n o n his luck,
struggling to revitalise his pro-
tegee's fame, w h e n he suddenly
hits o n the highly original notion
that her untimely death w o u l d
raise her profile no e n d . The bulk
of the film then centres o n
M a r t y ' s abortive a t t e m p t s to
orchestrate this fatality.
No attempt is made to dispel
the suspicion that this is a Mayall
vehicle, and his facial contortions
adorn every scene. Danny Aiello,
however, shines as the sinister M r
Rathbone, w h o is convinced that
Marty can make a success of his
son's awful Britpop band. Jane
Horrocks too is superb as the self-
o b s e s s e d M a v i s , never straying
too far over the top. The music
throughout is excellent, and her
soulful anthems are no exception -
perfectly capturing an artist striv-
ing for a more mature s o u n d .
There are one or two genuine-
ly funny m o m e n t s , notably M a v i s '
d e t e r m i n a t i o n to c o n t i n u e her
national tour despite M a r t y ' s best
efforts, and the film's climax is
surprisingly neat. Mavis Davis is a
moderately entertaining c o m e d y ,
but only M a y a l l ' s most devoted
fans should be disappointed if it
passes t h e m by. Q

STARSHIP TROOPERS THE JACKAL
Starring: Casper van Dien, Dina M e y e r
Director: Paul Verhoeven
Starring: Bruce Willis, Richard Gere, Sidney Poitier
Director: Michael Caton-jones
W
ith this effects-driven,
m i n d - e x p l o d i n g cre-
ation, Paul Verhoeven
finally turns 360 degrees through
the quality circle. Total Recall was
g o o d ; R o b o c o p w a s m e d i o c r e ;
Basic Instinct was downright bad;
Showgirls w a s laughably awful;
and now Starship Troopers rede-
fines the phrase "so bad it's
g o o d " .
The plot is intended as Vietnam
in space - the (amazingly convinc-
ing) computer-generated bugs rep-
resenting the Viet Cong, perfectly
suited to their home terrain, fight-
ing the pretty boys and girls w h o
enlist straight out of College.
However, it's also a vision of a fas-
cist future, where only "citizens"
have the right to vote - and the
right to citizenship can only be one
through military service. The fun
begins as the d o o m e d batallions
take on the killer creepy-crawlies in
gore-soaked CGI battle scenes. As
the bugs rip the soldiers to pieces,
you can almost hear Beavis and
Butthead sitting in the directors
chair, yelling out ideas "Yeh yeh,
monster rips guys legs off. Hey
cool. Bug impales grunt on leg.
Heh heh". Or something. Q

aving been disowned by
Fredrick Forsyth before a
shot had been taken,
hopes don't ride high for the re-
make of the 1973 nail-biter, The
Day of the Jackal, and the film lives
up to these expectations, ditching
the originals believability in favour
of all-out action and some really
big guns.
Bruce Willis is the Jackal, an
assasin and master of disguise,
feared around the world. Sidney
Poitier is the FBI agent sent to stop
him, and in a desperate attempt to
find anyone w h o can identify the
Jackal's true identity he turns to
convicted IRA terrorist Gere.
The chase then ensues, as
Willis dons false wigs and beards
by the score as (yawp) he attempts
to stay one step ahead of his pur-
suers . Yet the feeling still remains
that the squeaky-clean FBI opera-
tives have released one terrorist
simply to catch another.
As a safe evening's entertain-
ment, The Jackal still manages to
hold it's o w n thanks to some well
orchestrated action; a surprising
p e r f o r m a n c e from Willis, w h o ,
whilst not the icy cold killer the film
really needs, shows off his versatil-
ity; and that amazingly big g u n . f l

rying to cash in o n the suc-
cess of Scream, writer Kevin
Williamson falls flat with his
latest take on the horror genre.
The plot begins in standard
horror m o u l d , as four teenagers
driving h o m e from a party
accidentally run over s o m e b o d y in
the road and throw the body into
the nearby sea, Although they're
certain n o b o d y witnessed their
deed, the next summer they start
receiving threats.
Scream was applauded for its
knowing take on the horror genre
but / Know resorts to the type of
scenes which the former spoofed
so well, such as the female lead
alone at night, trying to solve the
mystery herself.
/ Know just leaves us waiting to
see what M a y ' s Scream 2 will
bring.... Q
I
t's a Jennifer A n i s t o n m o v i e
- w h a t are y o u e x p e c t i n g
here - C i t i z e n K a n e ? What
you get is a perfectly competent
romantic comedy, with Aniston,
as an advertising exec trying to
climb the corporate ladder w h o
has everything (good looks, nice
hair) except a man.
As per romantic c o m e d y rules,
she finds herself torn between
nice, sensible M o h r , and the evil
Dick Dastardly...sorry... and Bacon,
who only starts to chase her when
he realises he has a rival. Will she
choose the right man? Of course
she will, and a g o o d thing too, as
M o h r shows himself off with a fine
p e r f o r m a n c e , whilst Bacon
remains on autopilot. Indeed, it's
c o m p e t e n t performances all
round, with Aniston falling easily
into a part not a million miles from
Rachel o n Friends.
Take your girlfriend. 'Nuff said.
