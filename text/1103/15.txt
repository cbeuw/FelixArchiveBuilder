A L B U M S
TORTOISE + MOUSE ON MARS
+ SALARYMAN
Camden Electric Ballroom
I
n the w o r l d of post-rock,
Tortoise are kings. This is large-
ly due to the fact that the
group's driving force, John
McEntire, has been involved in pro-
ducing, engineering or playing with
the majority of the bands that fall
into this badly-defined genre. So
any bill that features t h e m at the
top is guaranteed to be bursting
with experimentaiism, arhythmic
percussion and a dangerous ten-
dency towards fifteen minute long
improvised sonic excursions.
Fortunately, Salaryman keep it
short and sweet. Dressed in identi-
cal white shirts with black ties, they
look like the reanimated corpses of
Kraftwerk after a makeover from
Gary N u m a n . N o robotic keyboard
playing here though, as drum and
bass beats are twisted and w a r p e d
through a bewildering array of fuzz
effects and tone phasers. They
pound their battered old Rolands
with gusto, and make an interest-
ing, if occasionally unlistenable,
din. Its only on their final s o n g
Humus that it all starts to make
sense, where a guitar is stapled to
death to produce a epic dronefest
that could have c o m e straight from
Mogwai's Young Team.
M o u s e on M a r s offer a whole
different set of reference points -
in fact, every dance music style
from the last two decades. Heavy
dub is followed by electro, funk
chases disco d o w n drum and bass
alleys, and the c r o w d go m a d for it
all. Particularly g o o d are their hard
house tracks, rousing anthems that
drag our hands into the air as the
G e r m a n d u o take us to broad
plateaus a n d tease us for a
moment, before forcing us even
higher. W h e n Tortoise have finally
set up their huge amount of equip-
ment, they treat us to a gentle
w a n d e r through rolling s o u n d -
scapes. Dyed is compressed into a
(relatively) short ten minutes, and
yet they still capture the full vitality
of the track, especially in the 'bat-
tling xylophones' section. The band
frequently swap instruments, so at
times two drumkits and a M o o g
battle for control before the power
shifts to a slow, funky bass. This
spirit of improvisation is the key to
the Tortoise sound; only hours of
effort could ever produce a perfor-
m a n c e this effortless. A s they
played Night Air, a calm rapture
spread from the stage to form a
pool around us, and we were left
backstroking through it with glee as
the bass twisted and turned
through the r o o m . M o s t of us were
still s w i m m i n g w h e n we left.

MORRISEY
Battersea Powerstation
I
have never seen so many Dr.
Marten's boots. Never so many
of same covered by turned-up
jeans. I have seen quiffs before, but
none so large. A n d the daffodils...
well, it was fairly clear that it was
the right place. "I used to be the
drummer in a band called The
Smiths"; Stephen Morrisey knows
how to play a c r o w d .
H e sang superbly
throughout; anc
although his recent
trend of whipping him-
self with his microphone
lead was a tad distract-
ing, 1 doubt a single per-
son took their eyes off
his for the whole perfor-
mance. The music; well the open-
er, Satan Rejected My Soul proved
itself to be more than just a t-shirt
filler. The absence of classics such
as Dagenham Dave and The Last of
The International Playboys was dis-
appointing; almost every song was
from his slow selling Maladjusted;
but no one was about to complain.
It took the final encore track to
really give the c r o w d what they
wanted; and he came through in
spades. Shoplifters of the World,
Unite was triumphant, triggering
the most entertaining stage diving I
have ever witnessed. Grown men
leaping onto the boards as if pos-
sessed by demons, striving for just
a touch of their Messiah's hand;
with grace, a kiss. T w o men got up
simultaneously, charging toward
the unflappable vocalist before
being dragged aside by the few
remaining roadies a n d security
staff. The way was clear, and a lone
t h i r t h y s o m e t h i n g got u p , and
incredibly he had a full
fifteen seconds of stage
t i m e ahead of h i m .
Hugs, kisses exchanged,
hands raised to the
c r o w d in exultation, and
the fulfilled d r e a m of
m a n y ; a few shared
lines with M o z z a and
then he was off, The
M a n Himself as close to laughing
as I have ever seen. O n and on
blazed chorus after chorus, ever
louder, ever more glorious, and
then it was all over, the lights came
on but the magic stayed; the same
smiling faces, Shoplifters sung en
masse on the streets, and I wasn't
the only one w h o floated home.
The quiff is smaller these days, he
has one or two more lines on his
square, square face, and even the
nicest suit could not disguise a bur-
geoning stomach, but he has still
got it, don't let anyone tell you oth-
erwise. Viva Morrisey...

SINGLES
Radiohead - No Surprises
This is the third single from Felix's 1997 album
of the year, OK Computer. It is a beautifully del-
icate ballad nearly but not quite worthy of the
essential choon this week.
Space - Avenging Angels
W e l c o m e back Space, unfortunately. O n c e
again they have released a mediocre single that
appeals at first due to its sheer novelty value
based on the 'quirkiness' of the tune. However
on second listen you're soon convinced that
you've just had enough.
The High Llamas - Cold And Bouncy
H o w does one describe this? Is it possibly an
attempt at lounge core easy listening?
Background music at best is probably the best
guess.
Rialto - Untouchable
This is a very mature sounding s o n g with soar-
ing string accompaniments and y o u might say
it's full of pretentious overtones. Starts off in a
promising if brooding manner but then changes
to a pretty cheesy chorus. Disappointing.
Bag - Blue Suburban Skies
This could easily be Blur a few years ago. What
is it about the w o r d suburban that brings up
images and sounds of the Beatles. Well the title
of this track is true to its influences. Unoriginal
and bland.
T h e E s s e n t i a l C h o o n
Bernard Butler - Stay
The first thing that strikes you about this song is
Bernard's voice. I don't know what I was
expecting but it wasn't the angelic one that
you're greeted with. You could compare it to the
recent Verve material, which is fine praise,
splashed with a bit of Oasis's Champagne
Supernova. He has wisely stayed clear of any
Suede comparisons by writing in a totally differ-
ent m o o d .
Gravediggaz - The Night The earth Cried
A lament to the days of the slave trade whose
lyrics preach out over an equally sombre piano
line.
Wireless - In Love With The Familiar
Yet another bland guitary s o n g attempted to be
spiced up with a string arrangement in the back-
ground. The C D cover has a nice picture of fish
and chips with a side helping of mushy peas.
Out of the three items on offer, this song would
have to be the peas. 'Nuff said.
Insane Clown Posse - Halls Of Illusions
M e n a c i n g hip hop with an irritatingly catchy
chorus, the line 'This is all because of y o u '
e m b e d d e d in your head, which no amount of
effort can remove.
Skoot - Seems To Me
A lively, bouncy indie p o p song that is pleasant
on the ears but doesn't exactly capture any sort
of vibe. What is happening this week, there
seems to be a huge influx of bland indie tracks.
Cuckoo - Non Sequitur
This track is more grunge than indie, along the
same lines as the Fountains O f Wayne. It's a
catchy tune although it isn't very memorable.
