Contractors were stunned to dis-
cover a severed human foot while
carrying out renovations in the
Mechanical Engineering building.
Just before Christmas, a sealed sink
in the Biomechanics unit was being
converted to a store for workshop
equipment, w h e n it was found to
contain the disembodied foot pre-
served in formalin.
The police were called in to
assess the situation, as regulation
dictates, a n d subsequently the
coroner's office was informed.
Tony W h y m a r k , the project
manager of the renovations
remarked on his amazement at the
find and explained that the remains
were given the "necessary respect
human remains should be treated
with". H e speculated that jovial
medical students had planted this
portion of a cadaver as a prank,
expecting it to be found in two or
three weeks, never envisaging its
unearthing by unsuspecting con-
tractors fifteen years later.
O n the assumption its owner
has no further use for it, the foot
has n o w been safely and securely
disposed of by the college.

Student unions nationwide have
expressed resentment at the way
in which the NUS has conducted
their campaign against tuition
fees.
There have been n u m e r o u s
demonstrations, such as the one
held in Hyde Park on 26 November
(Felix 1100), w h i c h involved
10,000 people, reflecting fierce
student opposition.
Unions felt that the campaign
should have been spearheaded by
the N U S , and are severely disap-
pointed with their tardy and feeble
actions. Opportunities to recruit
future students to the campaign
through schools have been missed.
Unions have hit out at Douglas
Trainer, the N U S President, accus-
ing him of managing an ineffective,
undemocratic campaign by allow-
ing Labour alliances within the N U S
to obstruct positive action. The
N U S have been distinctly quiet at
Labour conferences and David
Blunkett even thanked them for
their co-operation. Some student
unions feel they have not fully ben-
efited from their joining fees.
Leeds Union have proposed a
vote of no-confidence in Douglas
Trainer, that could bring an abrupt
end to his presidential term. H e
predicted that the motion will fail
due to an absence of backing, but
Q M W proved him w r o n g by giving
their full support. However, the
vote is unlikely to take place due to
time restrictions. Helen Russell, of
Leeds Union, stated the N U S had
"portrayed the w r o n g image" of
student feeling and accused m e m -
bers of betraying those they repre-
sent in order to pursue their politi-
cal careers. Leeds union have not
surrendered and are still pressing
the N U S to take a harder line
against fees.
The N U S accused unions of
failing to mount resistance to fees,
whose introduction is planned for
S e p t e m b e r this year. The o l d
favourite, student apathy, has been
selected as the root cause. These
allegations were refuted by Matt
Hyde, the Q M W President, w h o
p l a c e d the blame o n Douglas
Trainer. H e defined the N U S as
more of a "leisure complex" than a
political body describing some of
their actions as "despicable".
ICU president A n d y H e e p s
viewed the N U S allegations as a
transparent attempt to shift blame
after a weak campaign. Although
he agreed that current students
w h o will not be affected showed
indifference, he suggested that the
campaign should have "targeted
people starting University". He
went on to say that one of the few
advantages of the fees would be
that they enabled students to c o m -
plain about the standard of educa-
tion they are receiving on solid
grounds, but he asserted that "edu-
cation should be based on the abil-
ity to learn and not. the ability to
earn". H e saw Labour's fees sys-
tem as unfair, as entrants such as
medics could expect to be paying
higher fees due to longer courses.
ICU is not a member of the N U S
and M r . Heeps has no intention of
joining. H e gave his support to
M a t t Hyde, and ICU shares his
position of o p p o s i n g the introduc-
tion of tuition fees.

The 22 Club, the Royal College of
Science elective social club, has
been banned from all college
premises for two years following
incidents of vandalism at a
recent dinner.
The all-male old-boys drinking
club met on 29 November to cele-
brate their seventy-fifth anniver-
sary, and were allocated space in
the M a i n Dining Hall and the newly
refitted Ante R o o m Gallery, which
was hosting a m o d e r n art exhibi-
tion, 'Blanket'. During the evening,
one or more of the revellers
entered the gallery and began to
abuse the artworks, covering vari-
ous pieces with wine, cigarette
burns and vomit. A n offensive note
w a s also f o u n d at the scene,
describing the perpetrator's opin-
ions of the sculpture.
The violation remained undis-
covered throughout the evening,
and the r o o m was not cleaned that
night or the following evening. "It
went swimmingly well... lively but
civil", c o m m e n t e d 22-Club presi-
dent Simon Baker. Unfortunately,
the gallery was due to receive a
press visit o n the morning of the 30
November, and was discovered in
its distressed state by the artists
Jason Pidd and Edwina Ashton,
w h o had c o m e in the morning to
check over the exhibits. They
closed the gallery to the press, and
informed College of its condition.
The situation was particularly
sensitive, as the 'rolling art' pro-
gram in the gallery is to form an
essential part of a forthcoming
National Lottery bid to fund the
new music and arts centre in the
library extension. A large emer-
gency meeting was called two days
later attended, amongst others, by
the Rector, the Pro-Rectors and the
heads of departments.
The 22-Club committee were
apparently unaware of the situation
until the president was informed of
the situation by Pro-Rector Igor
Aleksander last week. "Regardless
of one's personal opinions of the
exhibition, it is a very regrettable
incident. Steps are being taken to
identify the transgressor", he c o m -
mented.
The cost of restoring the exhibi-
tion, which has n o w closed, is said
to be around Â£ 7 0 0 . It is not yet
known whether the 22-Club will
have to bear these or related costs.
