DJ VADIM
USSR Reconstruction (Ninja Tunes) • • • • •
T
his a w e s o m e collection of
breaks ' n ' beats has been put
together by the pioneering
Russian DJ, Vadim, capturing a truly
multi-cultural collection of remixes
of his crazy d o p e stuff. It features
remixes by artists from all four cor-
ner of the globe including Japan's
DK C r u s h , C a n a d a ' s Kid Kola,
England's Animals on Wheels and,
of course, Vadim from Russia. This
is a g o o d reminder that England is
not the only country pushing the
boundary's of electronic music.
This album has a definite d o w n -
beat/ hip-hop feel to it but some
tracks are more rap/hip-hop orien-
tated such as The Herbaliser mix of
Conquest of the irrational, the
Jupiter Jam mix of Abstracts and
the powerful Theme From The
Conquest Of The Irrational remixed
by the Prunes.The style goes all the
way to other, more down-beat, no
vocal tracks.
There is outstanding use of
scratching throughout the journey,
and some of the ways that the use
of, what sounds like, live record
manipulation (scratch mixing at it's
best) is truly great. Some of the
tracks that stand out for this are
Kid Kola's mix of The Pimp Theme
(nice use of bullfrog sounds!) and
Herbaliser's mix of Conquest of the
irrational. The variation in the use
of sounds in the sample is diverse
to say the least - s o m e of the
things y o u can hear are whale call-
sand bullfrogs as well as a whole
host of others. This journey is c o m -
pleted o n a down-beat t e m p o ,
leaving y o u with a sublime feeling
after the C D has finished. Again,
this collection of bleeps 'n' beats is
designed to be listened to, so sit
back and enjoy the ride. E L c l

Drum Lessons EP. (Eye Q)
26th Jan.
Cool drum patterns and stabs of
guitar all roll together nicely, but
it's a shame that he decided to put
in the Hulk Hogan style H o o o o !
That spoils an other-wise wicked
track, other tracks not as strong
an O K little ep.
Skylab.
Judas EP. (Eye Q) Out Now.
This track is driven by electric gui-
tars looped, stretched and fuck
knows what else, over a breakbeat
style drum pattern. That guitar
starts to work it's way deep into
your mind and, yes, this one's
dark 'n' deep. Another quality pro-
duction from Skylab.
16B.
Blackhole (Eye Q) 19th Jan.
This track is a smooth, top quality
production and a pleasant journey
into the blackhole, jiggerly drum
pattern, echoing spacey sounds &.
stabs of trumpets, wicked tune.
Freestylers. Feat Tenner Fly.
B-Boy Stance (Freshanova)
26th Jan.
This as g o o d as it gets, an
absolutely wicked tune, you'll be
hearing this everywhere soon. It's
bound to go top 10, with it's roots
defiantly deep in the underground,
no sell-out business here just pure
quality. This one's gonna put big-
beat firmly in the public spot light.
Tuff beats, fat bad-arse bass-line,
awesome scratching, wicked lyrics
from the one &. only Tenner Fly.
Get this while y o u still can as it's
gonna sell out big time. You have
been warned.
Revolvo. Out Now
White label. (No U Turn)
This is dark ' n ' deep just the way I
like it, squelchy bass tones, clean
crisp beats and eerie atmosphere-
icals. It just keeps building layer
upon layer, then it's all stripped
back to minimal beats cut back ' n '
forth with more crisp beats and a
beautiful vocal blends over the
atmosphereicals. A must for those
looking for something different.
Goldie. Out Now
Temper Temper. (MetalHeadz)
You may have heard the
Grooverider mix being played on
the radio, with Noel from Oasis on
guitar &. Goldie on vocals, although
it doesn't sound m u c h like him.
A n d I don't see why they used
N o e l o n guitar, other than to make
Oasis fans buy it. It's sure to be a
big seller.
I prefer the Optical mix harder 'n'
darker as it uses less of the vocal.
Only Goldie and crew could make
this sound so g o o d .
A Guy Called Gerald. (Juice Box)
Radar Systems/The Fallen Prince
of Heaven
26th Jan.
Two dark d'n'b tracks give us a
taste of Gerald's f o r t h c o m i n g
album. Fallen Prince of heaven is a
twisted up selection of breakbeats,
not to be listened to on your o w n !
Radar Systems is a sneering,
mocking piece; daring the listener
to open their mind to the expanse
of its creator. A n EP so resolutely
ahead of its time c o m e s along very
rarely. Don't miss out, taste the
future.
Barabas &. 0D1.
Deeper (Phoenix Uprising)
19th Jan. 98.
This one boarders on hard banging
house 'n' techno with its hard, fast
driven beats. The Jon The Dentist
mix is more action-packed, using
that well-used sample from the
Todd Terry tune, also used by Jay
Dee in Plastic Dreams - y o u know
the one. The A-side is kept more
minimal, with a more trancy feel.
Both sides will certainly take you
deeper.
Random 2. (Beggars Banquet)
The Gary Numan Remixes Pt 3
This remix series continues. Dave
Angel gets things going with a typ-
ically funky, but unremarkable,
interpretation of Warriors. M o r e a
track for the already converted 1
guess! The Liberator Djs are taking
no prisoners with their mix of Are
"Friends" Electric?, and proceed to
rip the place apart with their hard
beats. G o o d stomping fun! Steve
Stoll has the last word. Remember
I was Vapour reminds us of his
minimal, abstract style.
Underground Resistance.
The Turning Point EP (UR)
" M a d " M i k e Banks serves up his
vision of how the future will sound.
Soul Circuits is a screeching piece
of electro. Sharp bursts of an organ
collide with stabs of electronic
pain. Spirit Caller is dark techno,
which manages to retain an organ-
ic, tribal feel. This contrasts to
High-Tech Funk, a minimal, bleepy
electro tune that'll bounce around
your head. First Galactic Baptist
Church is my personal favourite.
Finger lickin' southern deep fried
funk finds its way into outer space!
Rhythm Inc.
Tell The World. (Sweat)
Mid Jan. 98.
This has a couple of Dub mixes
that sort it out, fattening up the
beats, cutting d o w n the lyric to
only a snippet of the original and
echoing ' n ' looping it. M a k i n g it a
more full on track, those Dubby
beats save the day again.
Candido. Dancin' &. Prancin'
187 Lockdown dub (Catch)
Mid Jan.
This one-sided p r o m o has hardly
been off my decks since I received
it, and has got a great reception
w h e n played out. Strong bass
drum sets the pace, building up
with the l o o p e d title sample. Then
c o m e s the b-line that you can't
help but move to, top notice once
again from the from 187 crew
Jerome Isma-Ae.
Mellow Yellow Tracks EP.
(Compose)
Mid Jan.
The sister label of C o m p o s t
(Munich) releases this EP of relax-
ing vibes for chilled minds. Mellow
Yellow Pt. 2 is my personal
favourite. A catchy rhythm teams
up with a punchy bass-line to lay
d o w n the funk. The strings and
flute keep the piece fresh and har-
monic. The flipside contains two
mixes of the more harmonic, easy
listening flu bassoon. FTlCl
