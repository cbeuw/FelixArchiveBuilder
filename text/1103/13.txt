The Birth of Venus, Botticelli
What prompted these radical changes? The
Renaissance was a time of sensitivity,
humane scepticism, and intellectual curios-
ity. The old view of the world was chang-
ing. Religion was no longer of such para-
mount importance. Michaelangelo was ille-
gally dissecting dead bodies in an attempt
to make his sculptures more life-like,
Leonardo w a s carving lions in butter,
Columbus was sailing to the N e w World,
Amerigo Vespucci was naming parts of the
Globe, H u m a n i s m was conceived by Pico
della M i r a n d o l a a n d M a c h i a v e l l i w a s
scheming.
The Medici family returned to power and
their sponsorship of art continued. The
Church gradually changed it's views, and
the world m o v e d on. The Renaissance was
a period of great change and upheaval, and
also of violence and extreme worldliness.
To learn more about Florence and the
Renaissance, I r e c o m m e n d "The
Civilisation of the Renaissance in Italy" by
Burckhardt, "The Rise a n d Fall of the
M e d i c i Family" by Hibbert a n d
"Renaissance Art" by Russelli. Alternatively,
there's Mirandola, Machiavelli and Dante.
Or y o u could simply go to Florence and fall
in love, just as I d i d .
The Catholic Church, however, would not
be undermined. Lorenzo d e ' M e d i c i , died in
1492, and in 1494, a religious fanatic,
Savonarola, took power, exploiting the dis-
content of the populace and their fears for
the future. M o s t people were poorly edu-
cated and jealous of the wealth and influ-
ence of the ruling classes. Savonarola
wanted a "Back-to-Basics" campaign: for-
get reason and humanism, hell-fire and
damnation awaited all those w h o did not
follow the Church's doctrines exactly.
Books, jewellry and some of Botticelli's
paintings were burnt on huge bonfires. But
during this period, Michelangelo, ever a
sceptic, created one of his finest sculp-
tures, the drunken Bacchus. Savonarola,
however, didn't last long. He was burnt as
a heretic. As Machiavelli said, " N o b o d y
should start a revolution in a city in the
belief that later he can stop it at will or reg-
ulate it as he likes."
