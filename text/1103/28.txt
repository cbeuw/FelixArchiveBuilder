As from next week the Imperial
College Rifle and Pistol Club will be
holding a regular archery session
every m o n d a y e v e n i n g f r o m
6.00pm in the projectile hall at the
sports centre. O n hand will be
Colin Ledsome, a National Archery
Association certified instructor. All
levels of experience will be catered
for, from total n e w c o m e r s to
experts. This is a new venture for
the club so it is h o p e d that from
those w h o attend, a team can be
formed to compete in the B U S A
archery league.
Those attending must be m e m -
bers of ICRPC. M e m b e r s h i p is
Â£ 8 . 0 0 which covers the use of the
lovely new archery equipment and
tuition, not to mention the other
fun and games the club gets up to.
Those interested can e-mail
j . m c c a r t n e y @ i c . a c . u k or
jd.thorne@ic.ac.uk to find out
everything they wanted to know
but were afraid to ask.
ICRPC archers show that you needn't he embarassed by poor scores

Last term w e lost to these Peak
Practice rejects 5-3, largely due to
having nine and-a-half fit players
and finishing the match with the
goalie Chris 'Scary Scouse' Barlow
sent off. This time w e were ready
for them. This time it w o u l d be dif-
ferent.
The first half belonged to us.
Despite the m a t c h kicking off
before Si arrived and therefore
leaving him sidelined for forty-five,
the desire in the IC Reds was evi-
dent and the Vets were on the run
from the kick-off. Steve, back after
injury, finally s h o o k off doubts
about his ability to 'get stuck in' as
he mixed it with the best of t h e m
while still keeping his distribution
of the ball efficient and incisive.
Pistol Pete missed a sitter that
Martin Keown w o u l d have buried
but this w a s only o n e c h a n c e
among many as w e peppered their
goal with shots despite having the
wind against us. Their only real
chance came from a free-kick given
for an alleged back-pass. This was
ably handled by Chris in goal at the
expense of his knackers. At half
time w e were one-up thanks to
Martin 'Lineker' Archbold's fifth of
the season and the game had been
all ours.
Despite an impressive half,
Laurent gave way for Si and new
signing 'Bertie' Basset came on for
Steve. It was soon 1 -1 as Si gave
away a free-kick just outside the
box and keeper Chris fell over at
the vital m o m e n t and saw the ball
sail over his stricken form and into
the back of the net. Apart from that
it was more or less one way traffic
in IC's favour. Sterling perfor-
mances from Andy Ferguson at
right-back and Rob in the centre of
defence denied the horse-moles-
ters even the sniff of another
chance, and from this platform w e
launched attack after attack.
Debutant Bertie sealed the match
with a superb shot into the top cor-
ner with the outside of his left foot.
Great things are expected after a
start like this.
With a few more results like
this, IC Seconds could achieve the
promotion they richly deserve.

Hullo Everyone and a happy new
year. This is the first issue of Felix
since the previous sports editor
S i m o n tragically d e p a r t e d the
realm of the living. For those w h o
haven't heard the news already, it
is my sad duty to tell y o u that
over the holidays S i m o n was bru-
tally stabbed to death during an
argument in a M e x i c a n bordello.
This means that I have found
myself manning the sports pages
single handedly, a situation that
streches me to the very limit of
my meagre faculties and, sadly,
beyond.
If any hepcats or kittens out
there fancy s t e p p i n g into the
breach and helping out with the
editing, they have only turn up at
the Felix offices and make this
desire known. N o experience is
necessary as I will be only too
happy to pass on the few scraps
of information that I have gleaned
during my time here. Can y o u dig
it? I know that y o u can.

O n 15 December Grandmaster Dr
jonathon M e s t e l of the M a t h s
Department took o n 30 brave
o p p o n e n t s in a simultaneous
chess display. Play started at
6 . 3 0 p m and the last game had to
be curtailed in a "sudden death"
finish at about 10pm.
Dr Mestel was in g o o d form
and despite many daring attempts
to outwit him (such as playing ille-
gal moves, making t w o moves
instead of one and nonchalantly
completing s o m e maths home-
work between moves) he scored
25 wins, 3 draws and 2 losses.
The victorious challengers were
Nick M o l o n e y and Timothy
Douglas, while draws were
achieved by Branko Bijeljic,
Jonathon W h i t e a n d W o m e n ' s
International Master Cathy Forbes.

Imperial College fencers continued
their d o m n a t i o n of the BUSA c o m -
petition with s o m e excellent per-
formances in both the M e n and
W o m e n ' s competitions.
Eddie a n d Louise achieved
gold in the sabre competition with
M o getting to the last 16.
In the foil things were much
closer with five IC competitors
making the last 16. M a r k and Dave
H were forced to fence against
each other with M a r k emerging the
victor. There was a w e l c o m e return
for Alex, returning after an injury
forced absence to finish (contro-
versially) in the last 16, Eddie
reached the last 8. D a v e . D
knocked out M a r k in the last four,
but was unable to retain the gold
medal for IC. Great performances
all roud with five of the last 16
c o m i n g f r o m Imperial.
Unfortunately, the less said about
the Epee the better.
In other news both M e n and
W o m e n ' s teams have qualified for
the B U S A shield, losing out in the
main competition due to the ongo-
ing medical school saga, however,
most of those out injured last term
have recovered and there is no
reason that with our domination of
the B U S A event w e cannot go on
to win this.
Fencing restarts on Friday 16
January and as usual Ziemek will be
teaching. All are welcome (at any
level) to one free session, especial-
ly w o m e n for the team next year.
