16 January 1998 COLUMNS
Well, if I'm not very much mis-
taken, this is 1998, so a very
Happy New Year to you all.
Imperial loves you even if some
of the departments have a funny
way of showing it by giving you
exams before the remnants of
the turkey have been completely
curried. So much water has
flown under the bridge since we
lat met and I hardly know where
to begin. What better place than
the evils of drugs I would imag-
ine that the disclosure of Jack
Straw's name came as a surprise
to virtually no one, but this can
have prevented few from taking
at least a modicum of delight at
his misfortune. The issue of res-
ignation in this case is a little bit
tricky, though of coursethe
waters would be distinctly less
muddied had this happened to
the last government. Along with
the Robin Cook farrago, it serves
to highlight some very worrying
traits that have developed within
the shiny edifice of New Labour.
The first is, naturally hypocrisy.
When similar episodes took
place under the Conservatives,
good men were hounded out of
office on the pretext that the
Government could not apply the
"Back to
Basics" doc-
trine to the
country, with
e x e m p t i o n s
for its own
members. Yet
young Mr.
Blair has
made ethics
and Christian
family values
a key feature
of New
Labour. The
reason that
such breath-
taking hypocrisy has succeeded,
so far, in saving so many skins,
brings us to arrogance. With
such a large majority, dissent
can always be easily drowned
out, but Labour have gone one
step further by attempting to

quash all opposing voices with
Whips that make the Stasi look
like Girl Guides. Quite why Tony
Blair is so afraid of any opposi-
tion, even with an enormous
cushion of
179 MPs, is a
mystery. All of
this coupled
with the irri-
tatingly puri-
tanical stance
he has adopt-
ed offers the
Conservatives
a real chance
of landing
blows on what
should now be
p a j . a relatively
easy target.
Time will tell.
Finally, a wordof congratulation
to my dear friends in Security,
Ken Weir in particular. Those of
you with long memories may
recall the Friends of Palestine
shindig held here a few years
ago. It did not run entirely to
plan and they were banned from
the College. Surprisingly, they
were schelduled to revisit
Imperial before Christmas until
Security spotted the booking and
stopped it in it's tracks. The
meeting was moved to North
London and resulted in a very
large number of arrests and the
intervention of the riot police.
Regular readers will know that I
bow to no one in my admiration
for the Conference Office, an
organisation run with miltary
precision. It therefore comes as
a great surprise that they accept-
ed this booking with little regard
for what had gone before. I sup-
pose that even the finest opera-
tions in the world have their off
days, and as the cock-up was
spotted before Sherfield was
razed to the ground, no real
harm was done. Rest assured,
my confidence in Conferencing is
completely unchanged by this lit-
tle mistake.
