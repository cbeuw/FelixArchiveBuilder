Widespread hostility among
medics continues to emerge after
the decision reached last term to
submit a single entry to the
British University Sports
Association (as reported in Felix
1102). The debate at Tuesday's
Emergency General
Meeting has forced
the Executive
Committee of
Imperial College
Union to re-open the
discussion before
Council next Monday.
The meeting,
attended by more than
300 people, was held
after Katie Armstrong,
president of 1CSM
U n i o n , w i t h d r e w her
call for a union-wide
referendum o n the
matter. H e r m o t i o n
w a s s u p p o r t e d by
about 8 0 0 union m e m - H i l
bers. H o w e v e r , the
legality of holding a referendum
without first referring the matter
back to ICU Council for considera-
tion has been challenged.
Moreover, if the referendum had
taken place, it would have clashed
with the annual Sabbatical Elections
next month. The possibility of the
latter being turned simply into a
B U S A entry debate was thought to
be undesirable.
Responding to calls for his res-
ignation, Charlie Joynt, D e p u t y
President (Clubs and Societies),
denied having reneged o n his elec-
tion manifesto. H e believed people
B U S \
lllBii afflr^
i
had misunderstood his concept of
'hybrid entry' advocated during his
election c a m p a i g n . Under this
scheme, smaller clubs w o u l d sub-
mit a single entry, whilst larger
ones remain separate in B U S A
competitions. However, this could
not yet be implemented because
B U S A was not prepared to apply
different entry rules to selected
clubs. At present, B U S A is still con-
sidering changes to resolve similar
predicaments faced by colleges
incorporating the London medical
schools. A d e c i s i o n will be
announced in February.
A n d y H e e p s ,
President of Imperial
College U n i o n , w h o
forced the F.GM in the
first place, was glad to
have the chance to dis-
cuss the issue again at
the next executive
meeting. H e felt that
members of the execu-
tive c o m m i t t e e w h o
cast their vote o n the
last occasion did not
have enough time to
take in, a n d subse-
quently reflect, the
w i d e ranging views
a m o n g the population
of the college.
C o m m e n t i n g on calls
for Charlie )oynt to resign, he said
his deputy had done an excellent
job so far, and he had no reason to
question his personal integrity; any
misunderstanding was due entirely
to his inexperience in politics and
presenting his ideas clearly.

An extremist religious group
apparently booked conference
space at IC towards the end of
last term. The group, turned away
from IC after Police intervention,
went on to stage the event in
North London. One source
claimed several arrests were con-
sequently made.
It appears that the group, w h o
called themselves "The L o n d o n
Turkish Islamic Association", made
a booking only to have it later can-
celled by Security, w h o had been
advised by Scotland Yard that the
Association was believed to have
be a terrorist group.
O n e Conference Office source
said that after the booking was
made, threatening messages had
been faxed to them d e m a n d i n g to
know why IC was giving space to
"fascists". "We d o get events under
fictitious names," Felix was told.
"They tried several venues but
couldn't get in...we have to look
out for suspicious groups." They
said the Conference Office organis-
es around 4 0 0 0 events each year,
including those from mainstream
M u s l i m g r o u p s , but annually
receives "five or six" attempts at
bookings from extremist groups.
They usually have no fixed corre-
spondence address or a P O Box-
number, or may be vague o n
details of the event they wish to
organise. "We get fundraisers here,
and we can't be seen to be
fundraising for terrorists." Felix was
also told the group finally took the
event to Stoke Newington.
The Union also received a fax
demanding to know why IC was
playing host to a group of fascists.
Michelle Lewthwaite, ICU office
manager, said that the union was
telephoned from a man claiming to
represent a different group w h o
"weren't happy about them [the
L o n d o n Turkish Islamic
Association] using college... the
guy went on and on." The caller
then confirmed his complaints in
writing by fax. "I then called college
security w h o told me the event had
been cancelled," M s Lewthwaite
a d d e d . This has not been the first
such occurrence: "There was a
group here two or three years ago,
who caused big aggro," explained
Rob Clark, ICU Deputy President.
IC Security were unavailable for
c o m m e n t .
