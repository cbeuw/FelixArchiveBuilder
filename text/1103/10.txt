LASAGNA BOLOGNESE
This famous italian dish is an
excellent winter w a r m e r a n d
although it basically consists of
premixed splodge and stodge can
look really impressive - I often d o
it w h e n I've got friends round. The
preparation is fairly complicated
and takes a while so Sunday after-
noons (aka the armpit of Alan's
soul, or so I'm told) seems an
ideal m o m e n t to get d o w n to it.
There are three stages: making
the bolognese sauce (which you
can use for any pasta), making a
white sauce and the assemblage
(or putting everything together).
I'll go through these separately.
Quantities are for around 4 greedy
bastards or 6 quiche eaters i.e.
using 1 kg of lasagna.
For the bolognese, you will need:
f 5 0 0 g finest beef mince
*• 125g s m o k e d pork belly,
cubed
«• 4 0 g chicken liver, finely
c h o p p e d with a
knife (gross) or in a blender
(slightly less
gross)
1 onion, finely c h o p p e d
«* 1 carrot, ditto
1 celery stick, re-ditto
3 cloves of garlic, crushed
*• 1 can plum tomatoes
«• A squirt of tomato puree
«" Vast amounts of olive oil
»• Salt, pepper, mixed herbs
There is no secret to making really
g o o d bolognese: everything must
be fried in lots of oil until dark
brown. D o the vegetables first,
one by one as they take different
times to cook. Remember to get
the oil smoking hot before putting
the vegetable in and to fry the
pepper at some point. Drain as
much oil off as possible and c o m -
bine all the fried stuff with the
tomatoes (roughly chopped) and
concentrate in a nice heavy pan
over a moderate heat.
Next fry the pork until most of
its fat is rendered (melted) and
add it to the sauce. Finally d o the
mince. W h e n it is brown (not grey)
and just starting to stick to the
pan, a d d the liver, stir gently for a
few minutes until it have set.
Transfer everything into the sauce
pan, vigorously reheat the frying
pan and then chuck in a glass of
water (or better, white wine) to
deglaze the pan. This involves
leaving the liquid to boil for a
minute, scraping off all the stuff
that has stuck to the pan and then
pouring the mixture into the
sauce. W i c k e d flavours!
Leave to simmer for about an
hour until the sauce is fairly dry.
White sauce:
This is standard. Slowly melt a
heaped tablespoon of butter in a
large pan. Then add the same vol-
ume of flour and a pinch of nut-
m e g and fry gently until the flour
starts to colour. N o w take the pan
off the heat, add a weeny dribble
of milk (say about a tbl) and stir
thoroughly until the mixture is
homogeneous again. Repeat lots
of times until the mixture has the
consistency of say golden syrup or
warm conquaillotte. At this point
you should be able to add the rest
of the milk (make 4 pints, if you
have any left over it keeps very
well in the fridge) without too
many lumps rearing their ugly
heads. N o w gently bring the sauce
to the boil, stirring often and s i m -
mer for 3-4 minutes until it thick-
ens. Salt fairly heavily as this is
what the pasta will cook in.
Assemblage:
At s o m e point in the proceed-
ings, y o u should preheat your
oven to 190°C, gas mark 6. Take a
large oven proof dish and butter it
liberally.
1) Pour on and spread out s o m e
of the bolognese sauce. 1 prefer
not to use too m u c h per layer so
that I can make lots of layers but
that's just me.
2) Pour a large ladle of white
sauce on top of the meat.
3) Arrange a layer of lasagna on
top of everything. Break up the
sheets if y o u need to.
Repeat l)-3) until there is no more
bolognese left. Pour a final layer of
white sauce o n top, sprinkle with
grated parmesan and bung in the
oven for an hour or so.
The key to getting this dish right is
using the correct amount of liquid
so that the pasta is well c o o k e d
but doesn't float in a bath of sauce
when you serve it. The quantities
above s h o u l d be O K but the
author accepts no responsibility
for disastrous results produced by
others. You'll just have to practice.

Ed's hot tip: Try putting generous
chunks of mozzerella cheese on
top of the pasta each time you
reach step 3 for an even tastier,
fattier version.
