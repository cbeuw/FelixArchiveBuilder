Term has begun with news that yet
another student has d i e d . The
Director of Undergraduate Studies
in the Chemistry Department, Dr.
David W i d d o w s o n , said that the
third year was found dead in his
Acton flat on M o n d a y 5th January.
His flatmates attempted to revive
him, but he was pronounced dead
on arrival in hospital. There are
believed to be no suspicious cir-
cumstances and an inquest has yet
to be held.
The deceased chemist represent-
ed, according to Dr. W i d d o w s o n , a
"very different" case to November's
suicide (Felix 1102). "He wasn't
depressed or d o w n - a n d - o u t at all,"
he continued. "The whole thing is
total mystery... he s e e m e d per-
fectly normal, though a bit worried
[about exams]", though he stressed
that the student appeared to be
under no more pressure than any
of his peers. H e a d d e d that his
flatmates had been with h i m earlier
that day and found his behaviour to
be normal.
Dr. Margaret G o o d g a m e , College
Tutor, said "Chemistry is devastat-
e d . . . w e can't see any reason for it,
I don't think anyone could have
foreseen it... he was a bit of a w o r -
rier, probably on a first, but no
doubt of a two-one. W e had no
worries."
As regards the adequacy of
pastoral care, Dr. G o o d g a m e
a d d e d , "Welfare provision is fairly
g o o d . It's scattered, but that's it's
strength, because it's diverse, and
the links are g o o d . "
D r . W i d d o w s o n also told Felix
that "We worry like m a d as to
whether we're d o i n g enough"
though he a d d e d it was difficult to
strike a balance between giving stu-
dents freedom and imposing too
intrusive a welfare system. H e also
added that if the student involved
had difficulties they certainly
s e e m e d well-hidden from those
around him. A s regards the avail-
ability of welfare resources he said,
"We w o u l d have to publicise even
more the personal tutorial system.
We're not even sure if it's suicide."
O n e of IC's welfare advisors, stu-
dent counsellor David Allman, did
not wish to c o m m e n t on this par-
ticular case, though he told Felix
that students are w e l c o m e to dis-
cuss any p r o b l e m s with h i m .
"People are very w e l c o m e to c o m e
if any student would like to c o m e
and talk," he said. M r . Allman can

Work begins this week on renovation of the area around the Royal
Albert Hall, opposite the Royal College of Music, writes David
Roberts. The steps will be closed whilst the concrete layer which
covers the original gardens is ripped up, to access the three-storey
basement beneath. In place of the current cramped Victorian plant-
rooms, a larger car park, delivery access points and offices will be
packed into the underground area, to free the area from traffic.
When finished, the original stonework, balustrade and monument
will be restored to their present locations. The Circle area will also
be renovated, and the famous acoustic 'mushrooms' will be
removed for the Hall's ceiling. Although currently six weeks behind
schedule, the hall's chief executive still hopes that "the development
will be completed by 2000, restoring the monument, gardens and
public facilities to their former glory". Photo: Aliki

A m e m b e r of the Centre for
C o m p u t i n g Services Shop staff
has been suspended in connec-
tion with "stock irregularities"
according to Professor H y n d s ,
head of C C S , w h o went on to a d d
that "the matter is n o w being
investigated fully".
David T h o m p s o n , head of the
internal audit unit was, however,
unable to put a value on the loss,
as all stock records have n o w
been removed by police officers
investigating the alleged disap-
pearance. H o w e v e r , whilst no
official figure will be available until
a member of the C C S staff in c o n -
junction with the investigating
officers make a final valuation, it is
rumoured that the cost of the
"irregularities" may run into sever-
al thousands of pounds, and the
police are treating the matter very
seriously.

The continued poor showing of
City and Guilds Union officers at
ICU meetings has resulted in the
C&.GU President, Vivake Bhalla,
being asked to explain the actions
of his Union. Although M r Bhalla's
personal absences from several
recent ICU Executive meetings
were unavoidable, the reasons for
the continuing poor turn-out from
the C & G Junior Treasurer at fund-
ing meetings and several C & G
officers' absences from U n i o n
Council remain unexplained. Rob
Clark, Deputy President (Finance
Services) described the C & G U
as "failing to represent the inter-
ests of their membership". M r .
Bhalla told Felix that he had been
absent for the last two weeks "for
personal reasons."

The arrangements for
International Night, one of the
most successful annual events in
IC's social calendar, appear to be
going according to plan. A s o n
previous occasions, the event is
to include a food fair and s h o w in
the Great Hall in the Sherfield
Building, followed by a disco fin-
ishing at around 3am.
Chetan Tailor, chair of the
O v e r s e a s Societies C o m m i t t e e
(OSC) which is responsible for
organising the event, told Felix
that while the event w o u l d be sure
to pull the c r o w d s . "It's the
biggest IC event," he said.
H o w e v e r , he also c o m m e n t e d
that the expense was the main
problem: This year's event had
cost £ 1 5 0 0 0 , m o r e expensive
than previous years, with the food
fair alone costing £ 5 0 0 0 . "It's a
large part of the affair," he said.
Also contributing to the increased
cost is the new stage, being built
with e q u i p m e n t o n loan from
DramSoc and St. Mary's. "We had
to build it [in earlier years] and it's
a lot of hassle," said Samad Latif,
O S C honorary secretary. Both he
and M r . Tailor appeared non-
plussed at the c o m m e n t that they
were tempting fate by holding the
event o n Friday 13th February
1998.

A new campaign to kerb student
drinking is due to be launched by
the National Union of Students
and the Portman Group, a self-
regulatory organisation funded by
all the major U K brewers to
encourage responsible drinking.
The report will stress the impor-
tance of sticking to the govern-
ment's r e c o m m e n d e d safe drink-
ing limits of 28 units for men and
21 units for w o m e n each week.
Whether the guidelines will apply
to n o n - N U S colleges such as IC
has not been m a d e clear.
