David Rose: The Special Magic of
David Rose (Polydor).
A H ! O F C O U R S E ! David Rose. Who's
David Rose? Well, he seems to be an
ageing American arranger who has a
talent for turning popular songs into the
most unbearable kind of Radio 2 type
s l u s h . What he has done to Bob D y l a n ' s
'Mr. Tambourine Man' on this L P is
unspeakable, and he shows his complete
lack of understanding of the song.
According to the Polydor blurb, in the
late thirties, when Rose was employed by
the Mutual Broadcasting organisation in
the States, he was not allowed a full
orchestra, but only a string s e c t i o n : it
shows. Whilst one is vaguely aware that
the rest of the orchestra is there, the
strings screech their way to the surface.
For a person such as myself, brought up on
rock, and c l a s s i c a l music, it is an
unpleasant noise.
The most bearable tracks to listen to
are the four written by Rose himself, as
you can avoid having to cringe at what is
done to recognisable material.
T h i s type of music belongs to a past
generation. 'The Special Magic of David
Rose' is a record to avoid.
Dad's Army (BBC)
C O N S I D E R I N G T H E B B C ' S current
financial problem, with associated
programme cutbacks, it is not surprising
that they are trying to make maximum
profit from their popular T V series.
So, D a d ' s Army went from T V to radio,
and two of the radio tapes are now avai lable
on thfs L P . I doubt that someone who has
not seen the T V version- would find this
record funny, as a lot of-the buffooning
of Captain Mainwaring's Home Guard
platoon is very v i s u a l . Nevertheless.the
characters are strong enough to rise a
smile even in radio format; e s p e c i a l l y ,
of course, that mainstay of Dad's Army,
Corporal ('They don't* like it up 'em')
Jones, a l i a s C l i v e Dunn.
'Sergeant Wilson's Little Secret', the
C O N C R f t T
first s i d e , is built around a misunder-
standing by Mainwaring of Sgt. Wilson's
relationship with M r s . P i k e . He believes
that M r s . P i k e is to have W i l s o n ' s baby
(Private P i k e , 'Do / have to call you
'daddy' now, Uncle Arthur') with pre-
dictable consequences. Although the main
laughs come elsewhere, when the platoon
demonstrates its incompetence and
impotence during a talk on Mainwaring on
camouflage; to be able to get a camouflage
scene across on radio is an achievement
indeed.
'Something nasty in the vault', creates
the ludicrous situation of Capt. Main-
waring and Sgt.Wilson sitting in the bank
vault beneath a hole in the manager's
office floor, holding an unexploded German
bomb on their laps, unable to move. The
ensuring drama is again predictable, but
then, the humour is not in the plot.
If you find D a d ' s Army boring, you w i i l
find this L P pathetic; however, the
record is evidently for a d d i c t s , and if you
have read this far, you had better buy it
before the withdrawal symptoms start.

Lindisfame and Sundance.
After the usual half hour
delay in starting, the support
band 'Sundance' began their set
with 'Meet You In My Dreams'.
They were one of the better
support bands starting of w e l l
and producing a fairly reason-
able noise with odd patches of
good guitar. But Inevitably,
they soon s l i d into a dreary
repetitive sound Incorporating
the most monotonous drumming
that did less than justice to a
tangible evidence of the
existence of R a g . The .above
arguments are false because
R a g is a s o c i a l as w e l l as a
fund-raising event and a l s o it i s
perfectly p o s s i b l e to s e l l a l l of
them. R a g i s " s o c i a l i n the sense
that through it a great number of
people get to know each other
in the first few weeks of term
and it provides harmless fun for
most of the 'first 2 terms. The
main reason for large numbers
of R a g Mag being unsold is
unwillingness by the people at
the top to take on the extra
very good attempt at ^integrated'
organ/guitar p l a y i n g . "
The main attractioni of the
evening, 'Llndisfarne', came on
after an intermission of approx-
imately fifteen minutes. They
kicked off with a song entitled
•Stephen Wolf from the 'Roll
On Ruby' album followed by
'North Country Boy' from the
same album. They then per-
formed two songs 'You Put The
Laff On Me', 'a comedy song',
and 'In Your Head' both taken
from their new album 'Happy
Daze'.
work i n v o l v e d i n accounting
for them.
i I think that the general
feeling i n c o l l e g e i s that we
want a R a g Mag, so please tell
your V P and we w i l l try to get
this d e c i s i o n changed.
Yours sincerely,
