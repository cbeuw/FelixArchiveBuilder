2 FELIX
e d i t o r i a l
Michael Williams
A T T H E time of going to p r e s s , a
d e c i s i o n has not yet been reached by the
E x e c u t i v e as to which Sine they are
going to persue at next Monday's C o u n c i l
concerning the future of the F E L I X
sabbatical. The matter has to rest
ultimately' with C o u n c i l s i n c e it is
responsible for and has overall control
of the U n i o n ' s finances. The need for a
fourth sabbatical has yet to be justified
to C o u n c i l . The President has outlined
the need for a fourth sabbatical to me
personally but I am unable to say that I
was overwhelmingly convinced. I am
also very grateful to the E x e c u t i v e for
a l l o w i n g me to sit and d i s c u s s the matter
with them. But the most disturbing
aspect of this whole affair as far as I
can see is that w h i l s t there has been
much d i s c u s s i o n on the p o s s i b i l i t y of a
non-sabbatical F E L I X E d i t o r , there has
been very little discussion on the
possibility of non-sabbatical Junior
Treasurer.
My own view on the subject remains
adamant: Without a s a b b a t i c a l E d i t o r ,
even a fortnightly F E L I X w i l l be im-
p o s s i b l e and vacation i s s u e s for P C s
w i l l be non-starters. So as a means of
communication, F E L I X w i l l be of no use
and there are many t e c h n i c a l points
which support this view.
Do you want a weekly FELIX, a
communications facility? Or do you want
a dead C a t ? The choice is Council's.
The reason for F E L I X being only s i x
pages long this week is due,in part, to
the fact that Catherine, our very hard
working varitypist, was away s i c k on
Monday, which is the most important
varityping day. The varityper i t s e l f has
not been behaving as w e l l as it should
this week either. The d e c i s i o n to make
it a six-page issue was taken on Monday
and we have stuck to it rather than take
the r i s k of re-designing the i s s u e and
finding ourselves pushed for time (rather
more than usual on Thursday.
A l s o , due to the limited space av-
a i l a b l e , it was decided to defer John
R a n d a l l ' s letter until next week. Is that
OK, Vaughn Phillips?
The winner of the Prize Crossword
last week is Andrew Walker of Physics 2.

Dear Sir,
A s a black 'lefty', Trev
P h i l l i p s i s , no doubt quite
impartial about the National
Front, but in h i s latest out-
burst ( F E L I X N o . 374, 'Preci-
Pice') he has shown both an
apparent ignorance of the aims
and ideas of the N . F . and, a l s o ,
the b a s i c a l l y totalitarian att-
itude of a l l lefties' to opinions
which they do not happen to
share.
The N a t i o n a l Front has
always believed that B r i t i s h
(i.e. 'white') people should be
put first in what i s , after a l l ,
their own country, and that the
appointment of foreign im-
migrants, such as 'Lord' D a v i d
P i t t , chairman of the G . L . C . ,
to positions of power over
B r i t i s h people i s fundamentally
wrong, and, therefore, anyone
voting for the N . F . has always
been voting for a 100% B r i t i s h
'establishment', so, in that
sense, the N . F . i s , and always
has been, '100% racialist' — but
the A f r i c i a n and Indian
nationalist movements, which
Trev P h i l l i p s presumably
admires, take exactly the same
attitude to foreigners in their
countries: we the National
Front are simply a British
nationalist movement Despite
the opinions of our President,
there i s nothing new or
'presumably' about any of this,
it i s common knowledge to
anyone who has bothered to
read any N . F . bumph, as
opposed to reading what people
say about the N . F .
Mr. P h i l l i p s ' comments about
the 'Hitler was right' brigade
being i n the ascendancy i n the
N . F . are utter rubbish, and
show, once again, how little he
knows about our party. H i t l e r
was, in the opinion of most, if
not a l l , N . F . members, a
thoroughly e v i l man, as was
Stalin, the only difference
between them being that N a z i
tyranny died i n 1945, whereas
Communist tyranny i s s t i l l very
much around. F a r from the N . F .
being N a z i , the wife of our
chairman, Mr.John K i n g s l e y
Read, l i v e d i n N a z i - o c c u p i e d
Europe and suffered con-
siderably at the hands of the
Germans; Mr.Read himself was
awarded a medal for services
rendered to the P o l i s h people
during the l a s t war, and the
N . F . today has many J e w i s h
members (just as we have many
Methodists, C of E , Roman
C a t h o l i c s and agnosticmembers).
We do not admit black people to
our Party because we b e l i e v e
that, i f a black person really
believed i n our p o l i c i e s , he or
she would see that the best
thing they c o u l d do to help
B r i t i a n i s to go back where
they came from rather than
hanging around depriving
B r i t i s h people of jobs, houses,
etc.
F i n a l l y , Mr. P h i l l i p s lets
his real opinion of B r i t i s h
democracy show by demanding
that the N . F . be prosecuted as
their p o l i c i e s and a c t i v i t i e s are
'unlawful' — presumably under
the anti-democratic R a c e
Relations 'Act'. The N a t i o n a l
Front i s a party of democracy,
and under an N . F . government
anyone w i l l be perfectly free to
put forward his point of view
without let or hindrance,
provided only he does not use
violence (or advocate the use
of violence - IS, IMG, C P E
(ML) etc. beware!) to gain h i s

people who disagree with us,
nor, u n l i k e the Left, w i l l we
try to prevent our p o l i t i c a l
opponents putting out bumph

We in the N F are prepared to

open and reasoned debate, for
in this way, a n d i n this way
alone, we believe, does one
defeat (or become converted to)
ideas one does not agree with—
not by l o c k i n g up (or beating up)
the people who hold those
ideas. In c o n c l u s i o n , therefore,
I too am 'only slightly dis-

would not want a f a s c i s t l i k e

Dear Sir,
A t the last meeting of the
Imperial C o l l e g e C a r n i v a l
Committee a d e c i s i o n was taken
not to have a R a g Mag next year.
The main arguments put forward
against a R a g Mag were:
(i) that R a g i s purely for
r a i s i n g money and as the
R a g Mag u s u a l l y only just
covers its c o s t s , it i s not
worth having, and
(ii) there are a l w a y s several
thousand left.
i feel that we ought to have a
R a g Mag since i t provides
