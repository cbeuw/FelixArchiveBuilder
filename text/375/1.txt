DEPOSIT
HOW MANY students have
renting a room or sharing in a
seemingly reasonable people?
Advertising, or the card
outside a stationers, offering a
room at a very reasonable rent,
brings many students in dire
necessity of finding accom-
modation. T h e request for one
month's rent in advance a n d a
deposit of not less than one
month's rent i s u s u a l l y required
and i s accepted i n view of the
room and f a c i l i t i e s and seems
more than fair.
After a few weeks niggling
incidents occur and in many
cases major harrassment which
either drives the student out or
a direct notice to quit i s i s s u e d .
Then comes the crunch, try
to get the deposit back. These
sharks know that very few
students c a n take expensive
legal action and after a long
correspondence the matter i s
dropped and the people letting
can start a l l over again, i f they
have not already done s o .
Two cases are quoted below
which happened recently to me
and if i t in some small measure
ensures that others will not fall
into the sharks' trap, then some
good w i l l come of it.

there and then, sharing with an
unmarried couple. A returnable
deposit of £20.00 w a s asked
for and paid, together with one
one month's rent i n advance.
L e s s than a month later I was
kept awake a l l night by a
drunken row going on i n the
lounge (next to my room) a n d
although this was extremely
unpleasant I decided to overlook
it this once. However, a few
weeks later there w a s an
almighty violent altercation —

beating up, glasses and furniture
being smashed; i f murder h a d
taken place i t would not have
been surprising. Next day I
moved out a n d resided with a
friend.
Numerous letters were sent
requesting the return of the
£20.00 deposit, this they then
referred to a s 'key money' and
this I am given to understand i s
i l l e g a l . In any case they h e l d
one week's money for which I
received nothing. I asked a
'Local Advice Centre' to write
on my behalf and he agreed that
their action constituted harr-
assment. Not one answer to any
letter whether registered or not
and even a threat of a summons
failed to e l i c i t a reply. Goodbye
£20.00.
In December I replied to an
advertisement i n the ' T i m e s '

PRESSURE
'SENNET IS substantially diverting advertising revenue
from most of the London Student Newspapers by claiming the
ludicrously high figure of 100,000 as its readership'.
That w a s the message that
came over loud a n d clear from
the third meeting of the L o n d o n
Student Newspaper E x e c u t i v e s
held at Imperial C o l l e g e l a s t
Saturday. Nearly a l l the r e -
presentatives at the meeting
told o f how the vast majority of
the Sennets arriving at their
U n i o n s are never read.
Some quoted instances where
Sennet had been asked to send
fewer copies but the request
had been ignored. T h e c o n -
sequent suggestion w a s that
Sennet might be trying to
preserve its circulation c l a i m .
R e p l y i n g to that particular
c r i t i c i s m , Jeremy C l i f t , the
E x e c u t i v e Editor of , Sennat
stated that this w a s purely a
misunderstanding based o n a
lack of l i a s o n . O n the» point of
the circulation figure, he stated
that 40,000 copies of Sennet
were printed each week a n d
that i t i s estimated that a n
average of 2.5 people read each
copy. T h e figure o f 2.5 i s used
by national newspapers to
F E L I X wishes to point out that it in no way intended to
prejudice the second reading of the proposed constitutional
change that the P G Affairs Officer should be a member of
the Union Executive. We therefore wish to clarify the
following points: Firstly all constitutional changes require
to be passed by two UGMs. These two UGMs must be held
more than 28 and less than 40 college days apart. Thus for
the P G A O to join the Exec, requires the motion to be passed
at a second UGM.
Secondly, whilst the gathering at the meeting did not
constitute a quorum, the meeting was quorate until the quorum
was challenged.
The actual motion has been proposed by the P G A O himself
on a mandate from the P G group in IC.
estimate their c i r c u l a t i o n .
Further d i s c u s s i o n o n
advertising brought forth from
Sennet's a s s i s t a n t advertising
manager remarks such a s
'you're being too honest' a n d
'you are approaching advertising
too fairly and squarely'. T h i s
did not appear to go down very
well with the rest of the
meeting, several o f whom fall
under a mandate from their
union and a c t on their union's
behalf.
The meeting, which l a s t e d
about five hours also c r i t i c i s e d
the N U S P r e s s Office for the
seemingly abysmal service that
it gives. F r a n c i s B e c k e t t , the
N U S P r e s s Officer, explained to
the meeting the d i f f i c u l t i e s and
problems a s s o c i a t e d with
running the press office. It
appears that one of the biggest
problems i s the i n f l e x i b i l i t y of
the N U S administration when i t
comes to sending out press
releases a t short notice.
Mr. Beckett outlined some
ideas w h i c h h e intends to
propose to N U S w h i c h , i n h i s
view, would improve the P r e s s
Service.
The final item o n the agenda
was the idea o f an advertising
agency w h i c h c o u l d be run by
students o n behalf o f the
London student newspapers.
The idea h a s been through a
successful p i l o t scheme for
handbooks and the natural
extension i s that i t c o u l d work
for newspapers. It w a s felt that
such an agency might prove to
be the solution to the Sennet
problem.
