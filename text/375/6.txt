F E L I X S P O R T
After a minor set back last week
end I.C. travelled out to G o l d -
smiths College l a s t Wednesday
eager to regain their winning
form. Our first mistake was not
taking an umpire. The Goldsmith
umpire turned out to have a very
individual interpretation of the
rules of hockey. Straight from
the b u l l y , I.C. launched into the
attack. P l a y remained i n t h *
Goldsmiths* half of the field a l -
most throughout the first period.
The only real point of interest
was whether the umpire could
d i s a l l o w a l l the goals I.C. c o u l d
score. The second half proved
to be a repeat of the first It is
romoured that Roger Hutson
almost had to touch the b a l l at
one stage but this remains to
be confirmed. The final score
was a 7—0 victory with s i x goals
d i s a l l o w e d . The goalscorers
were Trevor Tutu (4), Dave L o r d ,
Ian M c L e a n , Jeh Bashar.

returned after dark and every
one else had gone home.

later I was given notice to
quit. T h i s occurred at midnight
(after having worked a l l day)
and this c o u l d be construed as
harrassment. Stupid behaviour,
and snide comments continued
(he harrassment and eventually
I moved out and obtained a post

To students looking for
accommodation, I would offer
this following a d v i c e : —
II) Get a signed receipt for
your retainable deposit
(2) Be wary of a flat offered to
on the spot (reply to
newspaper/notices).
(3) Avoid being 'sub-let to'
(except with students
preferably at your College).
It is better to have your own
lease with the Landlord
direct.
(4) If possible get into a
student Hall of Residence,
YMCA/YWCA or similar
institution—and then stay
there as long as possible.
(5) C o n s u l t the University of
London Accommodation

Cup glory f o r I C
L a s t Saturday in the most atrocious conditions I can remember at
Harlington the first two teams scored two resounding victories in
the quater finals of the U L U cup. Our first team put in a typical
fighting performance against Goldsmiths firsts winning by four goals
to two. T h i s was a memorable game with I C at one stage trailing
1—0, ifter a tragic error by keep-
er Kev A l l e n ,but in the biting I l l ' s 4—1 and they should now
c o l d and rain our superior fitness have little difficulty in reaching
proved too much for the opposit- the final for the first time for
ion. K. Senkiw, a very powerful
front runner, scored our first two
goals and then the irrepressible
I.Postlethwaite nipped i n to
score our third after Goldsmiths
had pulled back to 2—2.
Glen Swably, whose delightfull
touches have been the source of
much pleasure to the K o p E n d
crowd at Harlington this season,
sealed the game with his power-
some years. In this game Steve
See once more proved a great
asset up front with his instant
ball control and elusive running
causing a lot of trouble in the
L S E defence.
The day was made a l l the more
successful for the football club
when news came over the air
that the 5th team had actually
won their cup game against U . C .
ful right foot cracking an absolute at Shenly and so go on to the
beauty in from the edge of the
area. A l l credit must be given to
our players for this marvellouse
display of courage and resolve
in the face of severe difficulties
and a l s o to the Goldsmiths team
who faught gamely for the 90
minutes and might e a s i l y have
pulled it off.
The seconds also proved their
worth when they defeated L S E
semi final of the lower reserves
cup. The team, after recent c a l -
amaties, was strengthend
considerably when those old
warriors R.Sendbach and A .
Wilkinson were drafted in and
this obviously improved matters.
Our two goals were scored by the
ubiquitous Liverpudlian M.Rogers
who leapt majestically to nod
the team into the next round.
