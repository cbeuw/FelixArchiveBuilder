Power-sharing talks in Kenya stall
Kofi Annan announces that talks in Kenya, aimed at reconciling ethnic groups, have been suspended
Katya-yani Vyas
On Tuesday the 26th of February, talks
targeted at ending violence in Kenya
broke down after the bitter rivals in
the dispute as to who was the victor in
the December elections failed to come
to an agreement on a power sharing
deal. Kofi Annan, the former UN sec-
retary general, has been leading the
negotiations and has announced that
the talks have been suspended, a move
that will prompt fears of renewed vio-
lence. In a diplomatic move to try and
compromise, Annan announced that
he would communicate with the lead-
ers directly to try and reinvigorate ne-
gotiations which have been staggering
along for weeks without any success. “I
hope these people will understand this
is a move intended to speed up action,”
Annan said of his decision. It is unclear
whether they will; Kenyan politics and
public opinion are extremely volatile.
The problems centre around the two
opposing party leaders, Kibaki, the
president, and Odinga, the opposition
party leader. The Former has been
accused by his rival of stealing the
election, while the president blames
Odinga for instigating the ethnic vio-
lence that has left over 1,000 people
dead and forced 300,000 people to flee
their homes after rival gangs, organ-
ised largely on ethnic lines, went on
the rampage. Negotiators for the two
had agreed in principle to create a new
prime minister’s post for the opposi-
tion, but they failed to agree over just
how much power such a post would
carry. In addition, according to the
Kenyan media, the government has
back-tracked on pledges to offer the
opposition some real power.
This is disappointing as after the first
few days of talks intended to find a so-
lution to the Kenyan election crisis,
the impressions emanating from the
room where the Kenyan government
and the opposition have been negoti-
ating were generally quite positive. Of-
ficials from the government Party of
National Unity (PNU) and the oppo-
sition Orange Democratic Movement
(ODM) were saying that “progress was
being made”.
But agreement was being found on
straightforward issues; the items at the
top of the agenda drawn up by former
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan
were non-contentious. It was almost
as if he was trying to get the two sides
into the habit of concurring because
he knew that the more complicated is-
sues lay ahead, and they would be best
tackled by two sides who have at least
been able to find common ground
on something.
Correspondents have indicated
that the parties will not bow to
international pressure, Con-
doleeza Rice coming in for
criticism regarding certain
comments that suggested
that bilateral relations
between the US and
Kenya could suffer un-
less progress was made
in negotiations. The
Kenyan Foreign Min-
ister has countered this,
citing that Kenya’s interna-
tional friends were free to support the
negotiation process but not to impose
any kind of threatening solution on
the conflict.
Mr Annan, who has been residing
in Kenya for more than a month in
an attempt to reach a settlement, is
expected to now meet the African
Union head, Tanzanian President
Jakaya Kikwete, who is also in the
country to help broker negotia-
tions and discuss what solutions
can be reached. In Nairobi, resi-
dents have expressed their desire
for peace, fearing an even more
violent fallout from the political
tensions. It is widely agreed now that
the two leaders will have to become
directly involved in talks rather than
acting through negotiators to main-
tain any kind of progress “The leaders
have to assume their responsibilities
and become directly engaged in these
talks,” Mr Annan said.
Both sides had agreed last week
Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki
to create the post of prime minister,
which would be taken by Mr Odinga,
leading to hopes that a final deal was
immi- nent. However,
they still need-
ed to finalise
whatpowers
he would
have. As
well as how to divide powers between
a prime minister and a president, the
rivals are also split on sharing cabinet
positions and the possibility of a new
election if the coalition collapses.
The opinion in Britain and indeed
much of the West is that the Kenyan
army is now the best option to stop
a sectarian bloodbath occurring, one
worse than the product of the violence
that erupted in December. The foreign
office minister for Africa, Asia and the
UN, Mark Malloch-Brown, indicated
a serious risk of renewed bloodshed if
talks broke down irrevocably.
The violence had died down recently
as a result of Annan’s brokering
of negotiations, but he called
a pause to the talks yesterday
after several fruitless weeks.
However, western observers
believe that extremists on
both sides have used the
lull to regroup and prepare
for another, potentially
bloodier, bout of violence
in Kenya.”We’re going to
have to stop the violence,”
Malloch-Brown said.
“The Kenyan military is
by far the best option.
The question is, can the
army be brought in, in a
non-divisive way?”
The army is, unlike the
police, still respected by
the Kenyan public as a genu-
inely national and multi-ethnic
institution, but its generals are
increasingly reluctant to involve
themselves because they want
to maintain its status and unity.
Annan is believed to have now
issued an ultimatum to Kibaki
and Odinga, telling them they
were facing their last chance to
contain the conflict before it
tore their country apart. ”The
talks have not broken down,”
Annan told reporters later.
“But I am taking steps to make
sure we accelerate the process and
give peace to the people as soon as
possible.”
What is on the horizon for Ken-
ya, an end to the political struggle
or an escalation of the violence that
could eventually bring the country
to its knees?
“The army is the
best option to
stop a sectarian
bloodbath”
