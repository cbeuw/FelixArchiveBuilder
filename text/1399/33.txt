TableTops: Citadels
James Porter embarks on a royal quest to quell thievery, as an assassin
C
itadels is a card game
set in medieval Europe.
Bustling market towns,
royal seats of power and
fortresses are springing
up. Every round players select a new
character (bishop, assassin etc.) to play
in that round. Characters do things
like collect extra gold (especially the
merchant) or make you the king. Then
each player will take a turn – gather-
ing resources (gold and district cards),
building parts of their city (e.g. a tavern
or a castle) and activating their unique
power. Points are scored according to
the number of pieces of gold it costs
to build the districts in your city, and
the game ends when someone has built
their eighth district.
In Citadels each player is compet-
ing to build up his or her town. This
is done by spending gold to build dis-
tricts, which are taken from your hand
of cards and placed face up on the table.
When a player has built eight districts
the round is completed and the person
with the highest combined value of all
their districts wins. Additionally, you
get a bonus if you have eight districts
and if you have at least one district of
each colour. There are five colours rep-
resenting different types of building.
Blue is religious, yellow is royal, red is
military, green is trade. For example, a
monastery is blue and costs three gold
to build. The fifth colour, purple, is a
collection of miscellaneous buildings
with various special powers. For ex-
ample, the University costs six to build,
but instead of being worth six points,
it is worth eight. The different colours
(except purple) also link to the charac-
ters; the merchant will collect income
(one gold) from each trading (green)
building, whilst the warlord funds his
campaigns from red districts.
Citadels is a light-hearted and, at
about an hour's playing time, has a
reasonable playing length. It is
also flexible, as three to seven
players can play. The number
of players has a considerable
effect on the gameplay. Games
often end up quite close, since
if someone gets ahead then
their opponents can gang up
to try and hinder them. This
is often done by taking the
assassin character and at-
tempting to make the front-
runner miss his or her go.
Each round the player with
the king token takes the
character cards and shuf-
fles them. He or she then
places one face down in the
middle of the table, so that
a character is not available
that round. Additionally,
only the king knows who it
is. He or she then selects
a character (keeping it se-
cret) and passes the other
cards to his or her left.
This is repeated until the
last player has a choice of
two characters, placing
the last one face down
in the middle of the ta-
ble. In this fashion no-
one knows exactly who
any of the other players
are. Then the king asks
the assassin to reveal
himself. The player who
took the assassin proceeds
to take his or her go. This involves col-
lecting two gold or drawing district
cards and then getting the opportunity
to lay a single district card in their city,
paying the appropriate amount of gold.

Now, this is a conundrum but
a good one. One of the Wii’s
premier puzzle games gets
the demo treatment in le Flash
form.
While Tomo vouches that the
actual game is quality (albeit
getting a tad frustrating), all I
have is the demo to go by. And
y’know what? If this snippet is
any indication then we have
quite an enticing puzzler in our
hands. It may be a single lev-
el but it’s a pretty interesting
teaser. Like adventure games
of yore, point-and-click is the
way to go although the selecta-
ble items are clearly marked
meaning that you spent more
time pondering and less time
groping for random pixels.
Regardless of how quickly
you solve it, it’s a tantalising
distraction at the very least.

Tower of Goo

Sometimes while researching
this column we come across
a game concept that seems
so obvious that we wonder
why we haven’t seen it before.
Tower of Goo, then, is one of
these concepts. Part of the
Experimental Gaming Project,
which pushed five MIT post-
graduates to create 30 games
in 30 weeks, it’s one of the
greatest experiments we can
think of. Back to the game, in
which you build a tower using
goo blobs as girders: creat-
ing the sticky equivalent of the
Leaning Tower of Eiffel. It’s so
simple that it works throughout
– the art is cute and cartoony,
but never distracting; the mu-
sic is upbeat, but not annoy-
ing; and the physics engine
that the game is built upon is
solid. And all made in a week.
We recommend getting the
unlimited version, as it ups the
difficulty enough to keep you
coming back.

They may also activate their unique
ability; for the assassin this is declaring
a character to assassinate. However, the
assassin does not know for sure (they
may have a good idea) who each player
has taken, and who is not being played
this round. So it is a bit of a guess.
Then the king calls for the thief. The
thief takes his turn and also selects a
character (that cannot be the assassin
or the assassin’s target) to steal from.
When the character’s turn arrives,
they lose all their gold! The thief takes
any gold they were storing up to build
with this turn. That character still gets
to take their turn (unlike the assassin’s
unfortunate victim) including getting
more gold, but it can be infuriating
(you can tell I’m talking from experi-
ence here).
The other characters take their turns
in order, and if no one answers to a
particular character it is because they
weren’t chosen and play passes to the
next character. In the next round the
new king (whoever took the king card
last time) chooses a new character and
play continues as before. The rounds
continue until a player or players com-
plete eight districts, when the gold cost
of all your districts is counted up
(adding any bonuses you may
have accumulated) and the
winner is the player with
the highest total (not nec-
essarily the most districts).
This is a tactical game
where being able to second
guess what other people
are doing will give you
the edge. You never want
to hold too much gold or
too many cards, as people
will target you ruthlessly
(seriously, though, this
is quite a jolly game!).
Additionally, it is good
to diversify your city.
Having many districts
of one colour will make
the corresponding char-
acter very valuable to
you for collecting gold,
although it will become
easy for the others to
guess who you are.
Choosing expensive
buildings is risky be-
cause you will have to
save up (cue the thief),
but cheap buildings
are easily destroyed by
the warlord. It’s your
choice; it’s a gamble!
If you would like to
play Citadels or other
board games and card
games, there is a regu-
lar session on Monday
evenings run by the Wargames society.
Don’t worry if you aren’t familiar with
a game – we routinely explain games.
