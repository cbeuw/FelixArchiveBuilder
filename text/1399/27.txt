Patty Lee/Sweet Descends
★★★★★
‘Patty Lee’ has wonderful guitar tones
that recall The Stone Roses’ John
Squire, and are almost hypnotic. Har-
rington’s vocals are very immediate,
and throw in some poetic lyrics (“She
moved like smoke and sounded like
ice”) and you have the makings of a
great song.
‘The Sweat Descends’ opens with a
few notes not sounding too unlike the
Yeah Yeah Yeahs’ ‘Y Control’, but when
Harrington’s fierce, yelpy vocals once
again enter, we know we are getting
something altogether more different.
It’s a very energetic song, and never
fails to keep your interest throughout.
These are two very, very impres-
sive songs, and I would urge anyone
to seek these out – you won’t be left
disappointed.

The Tunics
Cost Of Living
★★★✩✩
At first, you could be forgiven for con-
fusing this band with so many other
rock groups we’ve heard over the last
few years – their sound rings so many
bells. Listen a bit harder, though, and
you notice that unlike all the other
bands with their inane lyrics, these
guys have tried to provoke thought
and possibly even emotion with ‘Cost
of Living’. The track is also very well
produced, so it sounds pretty nice.
Definitely worth a listen!

Ida Maria
Stella
★★★✩✩
‘Stella’ tells the story of God giving the
world away to a 43-year-old prostitute
from Manhattan in return for a night
with her, and musically is almost as
innovative as the theme. The tune is
catchy and the chorus memorable. Ida
Maria’s vocals, quite hoarse at times,
are reminiscent of Janis Joplin, where-
as the manner in which she sings and
lyrics themselves resemble the work of
Lou Reed. A lively single, fairly differ-
ent from usual mainstreem indie but
still without that much to brag about.
It will, however, attract listeners of var-
ious musical styles.
Kate Agathos
The SeLF
Somebody Nobody
★★★★✩
The new single from The SeLF cap-
tures the feel of The Verve at their an-
themic best. As a mid tempo sound-
scape seeps from the guitars, singer
Herman Stephens delivers heartfelt
lyrics of substance with aplomb. The
way the song ebbs back and forth from
verse to chorus in an uncomplicated
structure makes the track easy to listen
to, yet also emphasises the songs tow-
ering nature. If The SeLF can produce
an album’s worth of songs like this, ex-
pect them to be leading thousands of
lighter-holding fans at a festival soon.

Camden Barfly
A couple of Saturdays ago, I was treat-
ed to a trio of semi-underground mu-
sic at ‘Kill ‘Em All’, held at The Camden
Barfly. The venue itself is a nice little
place – although part of a large chain
of venues with locations all around the
UK, the Camden branch manages to
maintain an individual feel and an inti-
mate atmosphere. I’m not sure if it was
due to the trendy Camden folk it has as
clientele, the general grotty-chic of the
place, or the reasonably priced Broth-
ers , but either way it has my approval.
And the nice bag check-in man was
a Ghostface Killah fan, so there were
thumbs up all round.
The first band of the night was an un-
signed acoustic singer One Little Plane,
stage name for singer/songwriter Ka-
thryn Bint. Admittedly, as soon as the
acoustic guitar is taken from its case
and a young hippy-esque lady stepped
up to the microphone, there was a
small but detectable wave of ‘here we
go again’ which made its way around
the room, constructively interfering
in my eyes and throat which promptly
rolled and scoffed respectively. I was
soon eating my scoff however as, far
from the 60’s knock-off cliché I was
expecting, Kathryn Bint makes lovely
music. Her voice is wispy and ethereal,
perfectly matched to the nostalgic, po-
etic lyrics, rich in metaphor and oooh
just loveliness. Also, I later found out
the innocuous backing guitarist was
Kieran Hebden (Four Tet), which was
rather unexpected.
Born Ruffians were next up, a To-
ronto based indie band, treating us to
some tone-saturated guitar twangs and
lyrics about being a teenager and the
like. Admittedly, I’m not a fan of indie
at the best of times, but their set re-
ally was a low point, embodying most
indie boy clichés I could think of. Car-
digans, predictable 4:4 timings punc-
tuated by pretentious 18-29s here and
there to mix it up a bit, falsetto tones.
Yes, Jeff Buckley made it OK, but Jeff
Buckley could pull it off. Listening to
a couple of tracks on their Myspace
afterwords made my opinion soften a
bit. Although it pains me to admit it,
they have some catchy tunes, and the
lyrics aren’t ALL about being a teen-
ager and getting dumped. Some, such
as ‘Foxes Mate For Life’ are quite witty
and intelligent (it’s because they are in
love). Generally, though, I had a very
negative impression of this band after
they had left the stage. Not my cup of
Darjeeling.
The final set and main event of the
night was an absolutely stunning per-
formance by German electro three-
piece MIT. It’s hard writing about mu-
sic you love without sounding over the
The music itself was enough to make
their set good, but it was the stage
performance of the band, vocalist Edi
Winarni in particular, which made
it excellent. Singing in a mixture of
German and English, the combina-
tion of his feminine voice and visceral
delivery made the performance both
fundamentally unnerving and breath-
taking.
Sadly, after a brief visit to the UK,
MIT are back in Germany for a while,
but if you happen to be in Manchester
in May you can catch them on the 1st.
Go see this band if you get the chance.
So that was my night at ‘Kill ‘Em
All’. After the bands finished we went
downstairs and got pissed while danc-
ing to filthy electro remixes of 90s RnB
tunes, courtesy of The Filthy Dukes.
Although it took me well over an hour
to get home from Camden, I went to
sleep happily tapping my feet and try-
ing to make my mouth sound like a
Moog.

top and ridiculous, but this was prob-
ably the best set I have seen in I don’t
know how long. Comparisons between
MIT and their electro-Germanic fore-
fathers Kraftwerk seem to be made
whenever they are mentioned (which
has been regularly recently due to an
up-coming album), however apart
from being German and being suck-
ers for the Moog, the two bands have
little in common. MIT’s sound seems
to have evolved from much heavier,
darker roots, using the electronic edge
to make their sound more menacing
while remaining danceable. Like that
scene in Blade where all the vampires
are dancing in the club before Blade
comes in and slaughters them all.
Think ‘The Knife’, but less poppy and
without the chilly Nordic feel.

Those indie buffs amongst you may
remember James Rutledge as part of
the early naughties band The Dakota
Oak Trio until the tragic death of co-
member Dave Tyack – a tragedy that
had a profound impact upon Rutledge
who stepped back from music for a few
years, only to remerge in his latest re-
incarnation – sampling god Pedro.
You, Me & Everyone is a truly enig-
matic album where track boundaries
have no meaning, themes and melo-
dies slide in and out to be repeated
later, and a diverse range
of influences
are com-
bined
(in-
cluding
free jazz,
psych-
edelics,
African rhythms,
hip-hop, elec-
tronic and classi-
cal genres) to cre-
ate a beautifully crafted musical Tower
of Babel.
This album should come with a
health warning – it’s a form of psy-
chological graffiti. It is really probably
best for those naughty, naughty people
amongst you who may or may not dab-
ble in certain cheeky forms of herbal
cigarettes to stay sober whilst listening
to it, or risk succumbing to the mental
aura of mind-bending samples in a way
that left The Beta Band’s lone pigeon
wandering the streets barefoot for
three years.
Perhaps put best in his own words,
after spending a prolonged period
listening to jazz and primitive noise,
Rutledge quite literally dreamt up
You, Me & Everyone one night. “I was
walking around the corridors of my
old secondary school, and I could hear
the album being played by this strange
band of about 100 people. I could hear
different parts of the music that I’d
been working on repeating and sliding
into earshot as I tried
to find where
it was
coming
from.
When
I finally
got to the
gym, they
had finished playing
and were all stood
staring at me. It
was glorious and
terrifying.”
Glorious and terrifying indeed. You
join the album by stepping over the
body of a comatose biker into a party
that is already well-established, and
tentatively open a door into to a room
where a pink rainbow flows into a
huddle of tiny penguins. Uber trend-
ies wearing 80’s style futuristic shades
mingle with kids from the ghetto, shav-
en headed monks sit on the floor play-
ing xylophones as, all dressed in black
tie, three members of the London Sym-
phonic squeeze past with their instru-
ments to the next room. When ‘Spools’
reverses into your consciousness you
can’t quite remember what street you
live on, but it doesn’t matter because
you’re having a damn good time, but
that woosy feeling you’re experiencing
persists into ‘Lung’ and you go around
telling everyone the guy on the decks
really is DJ Shadow. Then, feeling a tad
bit pale, you’re hit by a blast of synco-
pated beats and you realise you’re well
on the way to your first ever musical
whitie.
By ‘Green apples’ the middle-aged
man with the pink shades and grey hair
(who you suspect never escaped the
summer of love) is handing you a glass
of water and telling you to chill out
and take it easy but unfortunately the
simmering flutes, twittering of birds
and the improvisations of the 5-piece
jazz band jamming in the corner are
all a bit too much to take for your poor
confused brain. In the end, You Me &
