I
bet you expected to see noth-
ing this week, right? Truthfully,
so did I. Asking people to write
for Felix is a dangerous business,
because there are normally only
about thirty people who would consid-
er doing it and they’re usually already
doing so. Nevertheless, here we are,
and I’m pleased to say that I managed
to get a few pens to paper in time for
this week’s press date. Read them. Take
them in. Criticise them if you want, but
don’t you dare put the writers down.
We’ve got a whole bunch of comment
pieces and I’m proud of each and every
one.
Does that sound a little condescend-
ing? It’s not meant to. I’m genuinely
heartened to see so many contributing
to what really is a bumper comment
section. Heritage, sexuality, the fine art
of tea drinking and more – all within
a few pages. In fact, it’s making me so
The entries are in, Angry Geek has spoken and the winner is: Mrs McLovin’. Congratulations to that
pseudonym! Read the winning entry and more after a short word from our host, Mr Geek himself
happy that the entire idea of being
angry this week seems futile
and unnecessary. Have
you read the other
articles yet? No?
Why not! For
God’s sake,
go and do
it, and then
regret not
entering
yourself.
I’m not
writing
much this
week, because
I want the fo-
cus to be on the
entrants, and my
fellow regular contribu-
tors. You have in front of
you the widest selection of stu-
dent opinion Felix has showcased in a
long time. It doesn’t all relate to
you, but it does all apply to
you because these are
the students voic-
ing their feelings.
A shrivelled old
bastardlikeme
doesn’t need
to take away
any of their
fame, and
so I shan’t
attempt to.
Ques-
tions? Com-
ments? Want
to contribute
next week, without
the money incentive?
Get in touch with Felix at
comment.felix@imperial.
ac.uk. I hope that all who entered
will consider more regular postings at
Felix in the future, and that next year’s
section is just as thriving as this year’s
has been.
Why the talk of the future? Ladies
and Gentlemen, the new editor is com-
ing, Easter approaches, and the exam
timetables are out. As we all know, Fe-
lix is an unpredictable beast over the
Summer months, and so this could
be one of the last times you see An-
gry Geek this year. Nevertheless, I’m
happy to go out with a bang. Thanks to
everyone who contributed this week;
well done to Mrs. McLovin’ for taking
the prize; and a big thanks to everyone
who asked Tomo who I am. Keep ask-
ing him. He loves it, especially when
you phone him late at night.
We may speak again before Summer,
but if not – I shall see you in the warm
darkness of Autumn, bitter and cyni-
cal as I should be. Enjoy the Summer,
folks.
T
o coin a phrase: SEX!
Now that I have your
attention…
A. Geek is absolutely
right. Students are rarely
thinking about the refurbishment of
the union, the allocation of budgets to
clubs and societies, or probably even
the lecture they’re now undoubtedly
sitting in. I’d estimate I spend about
45% of my thought time – travelling,
falling asleep, showering etc. – think-
ing about sex. That figure rises to about
80% during lectures. And I’m one of
the statistical minority of women at IC.
Can you imagine what all those poor
sex-starved men are going through on
a daily basis? All too well, I’m afraid.
However, I have to say that lately a
bare majority of that sexual thought
time has been becoming increasingly
boring, at least from an entertainment
point of view. A couple of things keep
coming up which are steadily seeming
more and more bizarre to me.
The first issue on my mind is sexual-
ity. During the recent election havoc,
you may or may not have no-
ticed that one of the candi-
dates is the former president
of I.Q (the imperial LGBT
society). This sparked a few
conversations amongst some
of the people I’ve spoken
to which, frankly,
shockedthehell
out of me.
I am openly
and comfortably
bisexual. Not, “I’ve
kissed a few girls when
drunk” bisexual, or “I’m an
emo kid who wants to be
special” bisexual, but really,
genuinely, 50/50 bi. Most of
the people I know know that
and are fine with it, yet some of
thetiradeswhichhavecomefromthose
same people could only be described
as intolerant. It’s ok to be friends with
a weirdo, but you don’t want them in
power. Often women who discover my
sexuality for the first time shy away
from me. I’ve said it before, and will
doubtless repeat myself ad nauseum
for the rest of my life: think about your
preferred gender. Do you find yourself
attracted to every (hah) member of
that gender? No? So what makes you
think just because I like girls means I
like you?
By and large men are ok with my
sexuality, although I find it irritating
that a small minority seem to equate
bisexuality in women with “actually
being straight, but just a little bit easy”.
And obviously, there are people who
make the assumptions given above, but
for the most part, being bi as a girl is
pretty easy. On the other hand, I have
gay/lesbian and a couple of transsexual
friends who really suffer; not from
open bigotry and hatred, but from the
social awkwardness and mild disgust
displayed by others on finding out. (In-
cidentally, transgenderism of all types
is not a mental disease which can be
“cured” any more than any other al-
ternative sexuality is). The thought
that these prejudices exist at Imperial
was astounding to me. In a community
full of in- telligent, reason-
able people who
I have never seen
discriminate based
on race, religion,
style of clothing, cul-
ture or anything else
apart from possibly
choice of course (if
you do chemistry, bi-
ology, or materials:
HAHAHAHA,
CompSci: You’re
not read- ing this, you never
came into college today, Medicine: You
know what we think.), there are still
people who are scared of the thought
that someone undesirable to them
might potentially “like” them.
Admittedly, this is partly down to the
attitude of a small number of LGBT
people. If you’re going to give a huge
reaction when provoked, get used to
the fact there are people out there who
will go out of their way to provoke you,
but honestly? I think that a lot of this
simply comes down to the fact that sex
remains a ridiculously taboo subject.
On SHAG week people were actively
hiding their faces and scuttling by the
Sherfield Walkway, embarrassed at the
thought of being given a free chlamydia
test kit and condoms. My first thought?
Fucking brilliant! Condoms are ridicu-
lously expensive, and although they are
available from the doctors, how many
people are both aware of that and una-
shamed enough about sex to ask? And
if – whisper it – sex is a big, embar-
rassing, secret thing for you, then is it
any surprise you know little enough
about it to be worried by someone who
maybe doesn’t go about it the same
way you do?
And worse, if you don’t know and
don’t feel you can talk about the social,
emotional, and psychological aspects
of sex, it can really damage you and you
can damage other people without real-
ising. You’re bright, I know you know
the mechanics and all the nasty stuff
you see on TV about people not wear-
ing t-shirts embroidered with their
STD of choice (although I’d buy one for
jokes). If you don’t have the message
by now to use a condom or get tested,
well, it’s your body. But if everyone is
oblivious to the idea that one night
stands can boost your confidence for
one night, then crush your ego in the
morning, or that calling someone “fag-
got” (or, indeed, “breeder”) can really
cut deeper than other types of insult,
or that just because you can separate
emotion from physicality doesn’t mean
someone else can, then it creates a cul-
ture of everything negative you’ve ever
associated with sex.
Let me state it clearly for you: Sex is
nothing to be ashamed of, and essen-
tial to be informed about. How, where
and with whom you do it is a big deal,
because you have to live with it, but
having in the first place, or not if you
don’t choose to, is not a big deal at all.
Talk about it. Ask about it. If you don’t
understand someone’s point of view on
the subject, listen to them explain it.
And if you still don’t understand, well,
it’s just sex. Their opinion differing on
that one subject shouldn’t mean you
feel awkward around them, any more
than you’d feel awkward around some-
one with different colour skin. You
came to IC in pursuit of knowledge
and parties – can you think of a better
way to mix the two?
A winner
is you!
