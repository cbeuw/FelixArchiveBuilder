Flamebait: Team torture tactics
Alex Stubley won’t tell you if your base is encircled and you’re about to die; you’ll know soon enough
I
'm sure many people enjoy hav-
ing a large team game whenever
there's an abundance of people
free, whether its 10 AM and
your maths lecture group is
meeting up in the computer rooms for
a quick game of DotA or it's a Satur-
day afternoon and people gear up for a
long game of SupCom: FA.
Team games are naturally far more
complicated than their 1v1 counter-
parts, while retaining the variability of
a large FFA with the added bonus of a
few people to cover your back. That
final statement is the ultimate double-
edged sword though; you usually have
to rely on other people to survive and
achieve ultimate victory. Now I know
some people aren't great at games, they
might lack the necessary hand-eye co-
ordination, or they might simply not
be able to memorise various important
statistics for optimum play, but team
games are the best place to nurture
the newbies and forge them into the
deadly little machines you desire, bless
them. No, the people I hate to have on
my team are the ones who know noth-
ing about teamplay, somehow believ-
ing that somebody else knows every
strength and weakness of their playing
style and as such they demand to be
treated as an angry beast to be lashed
into a fighting state and pointed in the
direction of the nearest foe.
They are the people who have to be
notified when you need help, or if you
are planning an attack on the enemy
base rather than looking at the situ-
ation and gauging the consequences
themselves. Sometimes they will take
it upon themselves to ask “can your 6
workers take on that army of doom?”,
or simply asking “what are you doing
and what should I do?”. Others might
start ordering players around like they
think they know what everyone is best
at and exactly what works in a given
game. Now, I enjoy micromanagement
in the games I play as it adds that little
bit of extra complexity, but I don't want
to micromanage my allies like some
fancy bot, nor do I want somebody giv-
ing me orders that don't play to my own
strengths or current position. I know
what works for me and unless they are
new to the game in question, my allies
know what works well for them.
Why can't some gamers take on the
initiative for themselves and actu-
ally act on their own opinion at times?
Each member of a team increases the
overall workload of thinking and vigi-
lance, and as such each member has to
contribute their own share to the team.
A decent player can babysit their own
living “bot”, but unless they are made
of crystalline initiative, saturated with
vigilance and reinforced by the typing
skills of the almighty keyboard gods
themselves they will simply become a
bottleneck for the team as a whole.
There's the common saying in books
and films “Don't try to be a hero, it will
only get you killed”, but I beg to differ
in games. More shy gamers should be
heroic, arriving unannounced with all
guns blazing for the final push of glory,
emptying their bases to aid their allies'
last stand without being asked to or
even simply trying to put out fires and
functioning as a standalone by taking
opportunities against your opponents
and using your allies as random forces
to react to and take advantage of. As
far as I'm concerned, if you can't be-
come a hero for your team, you might
as well become an hero.
I've known players for years who
are good at games and good in teams,
players who are good at games but bad
in teams, players who are bad at games
but good in teams, and finally players
who are just bad in general. And you
know what? If I had to choose between
newbies who are proactive and will
always try to be a thorn in their op-
ponents side and bowl them over with
pure zeal and the n00bs who for all of
their reasonable skills look to others
for everything except the most basic
functions, I would choose the team
players.
So here is a message to those out
there who look to others for leadership
in games: I don't want to micromanage
you, if have to ask something based on
the current state of affairs, instead fig-
ure it out yourself. If I have to ask you
to do something urgent you have al-
ready failed the first step on the road to
teamwork, and if you respond to said
request by asking questions like “What
with? Where? Why?” then you clearly
have to go back to 1v1s until you can
keep tabs on everything that's going on
as the multiplayer battlefield is clearly
too complicated. I am not your master,
I am your ally, an equal to be helped
and who helps in return, nothing more,
nothing less.
If people can't keep up with the cur-
rent state of affairs, then at least spare
a thought for those who are actually
working to support their teams while
banging their heads at your lack of
desire to actually play the game. And
those who don't pull the weight that
their actual skills would suggest know
who you are, and I WILL be facepalm-
ing in your direction.

Metal Gear Solid 4 emergence “Pwnage” copyrighted?
After a period of torturous waiting and a rather befuddling trailer
during the Tokyo Game Show last year, Metal Gear Solid 4 finally
emerges from a media blackout. Fortunately (or unfortunately, de-
pending on what you were expecting), plot details have been kept
classified. What was revealed, however, was a solid, honest-to-
goodness release. The 12th of June, 2008 is the glorious day when
MGS fans will revel. However, it’s not just those in Japan who will
be celebrating since this is the first time Konami has committed
itself to a simultaneous worldwide release (and that means the UK
as well!). Finally, no more leaks, no more secrets and certainly no
place to hide. Summer can’t come quickly enough!
People do stupid things: fact. Heck, it’s not so much fact as be-
ing the largest genetic/memetic defect we can possess. But
hey, we’re cool with it, right?
Internet slang probably won’t count as one of the most intel-
ligent of human inventions but it’s silly enough to warrant some
juvenile-fueled usage once in a while.
Finnish-based Futuremark Games Studio think not. No, they
think it’s a serious concept and have ended up filing a trademark
for the word “Pwnage”. Yeah. It’s rather mind-numbing to think
about the lengths people go to “protect interests”. According to
the Executive Producer, Jukka Mäkinen:
“...we want to protect ourselves from squatters (or what I call
campers) – people looking to trademark the name on false pre-
tenses, just to make a claim
against Futuremark Games
Studio for its use.”
Err... wait... so you filed a trade-
mark under your name... so
other people wouldn’t use it ille-
gally and make a claim against
something... that you don’t re-
ally own.
I see. “Pwnage” indeed.
