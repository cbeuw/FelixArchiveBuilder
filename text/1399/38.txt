Needy McNeedy: dishing it out since lunchtime
T
here comes a time in the
life of every person when
they find their calling. I
haven’t found mine yet,
but I think I’ll sort you
poor fools out first and ignore my own
issues for a while. Email agony.felix@
imperial.ac.uk, because otherwise I’ll
have to start publishing the contents
of the IT security digest emails, which
aren’t even funny adverts for Viagra,
they’re just crap stockbroker tips.
Dear Needy Mc Needy
I’m having a mid-degree crisis. My flat
mates are out every day and I’ve taken
to stalking the people who live across
the road from me. There’s a man and a
woman, and I like to imagine that they
are in love. I make up little stories in my
head about them. I can’t stop doing this
and the lack of concentration is mak-
ing me fail my degree. How can I stop
watching my neighbours?

Dear IHaveGingerPubes
You are not stalking, you are people
watching, definitely my favourite sport.
To enhance the joy of stalking, I suggest
making baked goods (cupcakes are my
particular forte) in the likeness of your
subject. I find unrequited interest to be
a wonderful artistic muse. Write songs
about your neighbours, and when you
walk past them in the street, hum them
under your breath. Teehee!

Dear Needy Mc Needy
The other day, I was alone in my room
in halls and I needed to borrow a cal-
culator, so I looked in my roommate’s
desk. Under the formula sheet and past
exam papers, there was a stash a DVD
called “Fat Girls 5” and a pink plastic
replica of a woman’s, you know, bits. My
roommate and I lead completely sepa-
rate lives and don’t really speak. Should
I confront him about what I saw?
FannyHowzer
Dear FannyHowzer,
Definitely. Fat Girls 5 is the worst in the
series of Fat Girls DVDs; you must at
least mention the incident so that you
can tell him FG5 pales in comparison
with FG2 (my personal favourite). The
poor guy probably needs some sup-
port, what with Imperial being full of
skinny bitches; his needs clearly aren’t
being catered for.
I hope to God you didn’t touch the
plastic fanny, and instead took pictures
of it with your mobile phone as possi-
ble future blackmail material.

Dear Needy Mc Needy (a.k.a. Slutty
McSlut)
During one of my Management lec-
tures, there is a couple who show an
increasing fondness for PDAs (Public
Displays of Affection). This has gradu-
ally intensified from a gentle caress of
the hand on thigh scenario in the first
week, to kissing of shoulders and full on
snogging in the latter weeks, and I fear
this may turn into full on penetration
by the final week of term. Surely this
type of behaviour is far from appropri-
ate; please advise me on the best course
of action.
Fed-up Disgruntled Not Getting
McAny
P.S. I am also deeply in love with one of
the JCR Sandwich Shop Ladies but one
problem at a time.
Dear Fed-up Disgruntled Not Getting
McAny
What on Earth can you mean, far from
appropriate? This couple is providing
a service to Imperial. They are prob-
ably hired and planted in your lecture
theatre to demonstrate the good old
act of procreation to the vast number
of students at Imperial who, like your-
self, aren’t getting “McAny.” Given that
you’re the entrepreneurial type who
takes management lectures, I would
suggest investing in a good quality
video camera, tape the actual penetra-
tion and sell it to SciFiSoc, who I’ve
heard have a secret corner for that
kind of thing. Make sure there are vis-
ible nipples, as that’ll bump the price
up somewhat.
Now, about the JCR Sandwich Shop
Lady. I’m assuming it’s the cute red-
head, in which case I can’t actually
help you, but I do have (by chance) the
number of one of the men, if you’re
interested in that kind of thing. He
thought my urgent glance in his di-
rection was a “lets fuck” glance, when
it actually meant, “don’t forget that
you’ve taken my money and have not
yet handed me my food.” I no longer
use the burger bar.

Virgo
The nurse knocks
on the door. “One
moment,” your
breath is heavy, “this
sperm receptacle
is far smaller than
I was expecting. Give me a sec.” There’s spaff
all over the shop. DILEMMA! Do you A: Grab
an old sock and wipe it all up, B: Blame the
Albino kid sitting in the corner or C: break the
door down, punch the nurse in the baps and
run away screaming incoherently?
Scorpio
This week you lose
your marbles. You
could have sworn
you packed them
away in the cup-
board, safe from
your little sister Tilly. Hold on, or was it last
week? WERE THEY EVEN MARBLES? Per-
haps it was my Pogs that I put in the cupboard?
Oh GOD. GIVE ME TWO NORMALS FOR
MY SHINY. THERE’S A CAR COMING!
WATCH OU...
Libra
Whilst writing the
final horoscope, I’ve
coughed up a bit of
bile. It tastes prett...
oh hold on...
...
Ok, that wasn’t pleasant. My keyboard is
covered in vomit and my right eye ball has
popped out and the mouse has run off with it.
...
Sigh, moan.
Sagittarius
This week a manta
ray barbs you in the
chest. This week
a man shoots you
with a sniper rifle
whilst your sitting in
the back seat of a cadillac. This week your car
crashes in a tunnel in Paris. This week you get
alcohol poisoning. This week your aeroplane
crashes in Munich. This week an aeroplane
crashes into your office desk on the 64th floor.
Bad luck.
Capricorn
This week..... oh my
god he’s turned his
back... for the love
of God... please,
help I’m trapped
down here in the
Felix basement and the editor makes me
lick his nipples, call him “The Sergeant” and
beats me if I don’t write upon request. HE’S
COMING... RESCUE ME!!! I KNOW THE
SECRET OF ANGRY GE...
Cancer
Shank Rules 101:
1) Always conceal
your shank beneath
at least four layers
of clothing. Two as
a disguise, two for
your body’s own safety. 2) Aim for the kidneys
from behind your victim. 3) Twist the shank
upon insertion, that way the bleeding never
ceases. 4) Immediately drop the shank after
pain is inflicted for an effective blood splatter.
Gemini
This week your
become fascinated
by papier-mâché.
You hoard copies of
The Sun, The News
Of The World, The
Times but definitely not the Evening Stand-
ard, oh no. Your girlfriend comes home one
evening to find you dressed as a paper mani-
fesation of Tony Blair. Out comes the Shocker:
“Two in the snapper, one in the crapper. Brace
yourself love.”
Leo
This week you have
a flier fight in the
office. The bitter,
gruelling ordeal lasts
for four whole days.
Paper blades soared
through the air, Black Sheep hologram fliers
shatter all over the place and your business
cards get lodged into the Raconteurs poster.
Tell no one. Casualties of war were inevitable
but we will remember the eighty-eight victims
lost in the Felix Wars Fall 2008.
Taurus
This week I’ve
somehow developed
an acute computer
keyboard phobia.
I’m writing this
horoscope by prod-
ding the keyboard with two 6 foot long bam-
boo canes. It’s extremely un productive and it’s
making my arms and eyes hurt more than that
time I saw that German porn movie starring
your sister. Dogs shouldn’t be made to do such
things. Don’t ask how that video hurt my arms.
Aries
Is it me, or does this
symbol look a little
bit like a clunge? OH
YEAH, I SAID IT! If
this turns you on
more than the page
3 photos, then you’ve got problems. I’d hit
that baby. Yeah I’m talking about that baby I’m
going to beat up later, it’s how I get my kicks –
what the hell is your problem arsehole? Time
to get gacked up rock’n’roll style.
Pisces
The Pisces symbol is
actually one of those
optical illusions,
The two ‘curved’
lines are in fact
parallel and straight.
Don’t believe me? Get a ruler out and try it for
yourself. You calling me a liar? I’ll do you in.
Get the hell off my H to the o,r,o, sizzle copes
Horoscopes page this instant or I’ll shank you.
Prison rules. If I see anyone with a ruler out in
lectures, so help me God I will end them.
H to the o, r, o, sizzle copes – it’s the Horoscopes
Aquarius
ROFLZOR-REXI-
CALS. I just heard
the funniest joke,
only I can’t remem-
ber what it was...
D’oh. Don’t you
just hate it when that happens... you’re set for
some rib tickling and then some arsehole lets
you down right at the last moment. Come to
think of it... there’s some kind of horrific irony
in this ‘scope really isn’t there? I’m going to
burn your family alive with a soldering iron.
