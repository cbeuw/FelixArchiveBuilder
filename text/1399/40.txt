Logic Puzzle: Phobias
Using the clues and logical deduction
alone, work out how all the people
involved in the match relate to each
other. The puzzle can be solved with-
out guesswork. Make use of the grid to
mark the combinations that you know.
Read through each clue and make any
obvious or stated deductions. Find the
corresponding row and column on the
grid and place a tick for ‘Yes’ in the box,
and a cross for ‘No’ in the cells next to
this one vertically and horizontally.
Five students at Imperial have five dif-
ferent odd phobias. Can you find out
which student has which phobia, what
that phobia is and how it started?
1. The woman who hibernates is either
suffering from Chionophobia or Al-
liumphobia and either has the fear of
chins or the Fear of Snow.
2. Angelina either avoids Jimmy Hill or
wears gloves to avoid her phobia. The
woman who has a fear of bums either
has Hobophobia or Xylophobia.
