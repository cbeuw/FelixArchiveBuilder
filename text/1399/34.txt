Another Take
“Well, I might add that – com-
pared to my old Logitech – I
wasn’t blown away by the high
CPI (I play with low sensitivity).
Light, smooth-glide and the
comfort key are appreciable
however.”
Derek Chow
M
ice,
they're probably
one of the most over-
looked aspects of a
computer. The aver-
age user will perhaps understand the
need for more GHz or a larger hard-
drive but it will never occur to them to
question the rodent which falls out of
the computer box. Now for the most
part your standard mouse is sufficient
to meet the demands of the majority
of people so this isn't such a problem.
But if you are a gamer (and if you are
reading this I assume you are) things
are very different. A decent mouse can
mean the difference between life and
death, or so I've been repeatedly told.
You see until recently I was that aver-
age user, fragging away with my good
old Microsoft Intellimouse, which I
thought was perfectly adequate.
It was only a few weeks ago
when I finally took the
plunge and purchased a
Steel Series Ikari optical
mouse to see whether
it made any differ-
ence to my gam-
ing aptitude.
You may be
wondering "why
not go for a la-
ser mouse
instead of
an opti-
cal?". Steel
Series actu-
ally recom-
mends the
optical version
of the Ikari, rather
than the laser, for FPS gam-
ing as it can cope with extremely fast
mouse movement slightly better. They
recommend the laser for MMO/RTS
gamers who use the mouse with a high
sensitivity setting but still require a
high degree of accuracy. In actual fact,
the overwhelming reason for getting
a laser mouse, and indeed the main
reason why they were invented, is be-
cause they are much better at tracking
on shiny surfaces that normal optical
mice can't cope with. Suffice to say, if
you use a proper mouse mat, either a
laser or standard optical mouse will
serve you fine.
To test the Ikari I got stuck into some
Team Fortress 2 . This has been a game
of choice for me recently so I thought it
would be the perfect game to test some
quick-paced, high sensitivity, run,
jump, shoot, repeat gaming along with
the occasional slower sniping.
TheIkari'sdesignimmediatelystands
out from the instant you first wield the
device. The first thing that struck me
is that this mouse is huge; its definitely
not for people with small hands. Once
I got used to the size, however, I found
it very comfortable and a pleasure to
use. Steel Series called in a number
of professional gaming teams, includ-
ing SK gaming, to co-design the de-
vice and subsequently the mouse has
a very finely tuned design. It doesn't
have many of the superfluous features
of other gaming mice such as weights
or glowing scroll wheels like you get
on Razors, so you're left with just an
excellent mouse. By far the mouse's
best feature has to be the DPI switch-
ing button: storing, in the mouse itself,
two different sensitivities that can be
preset! The user can switch between
high and low sensitivity with just a sin-
gle click of a button (albeit with a 3 sec-
ond delay); enabling him/her to use it
for different applications. Try using a
Razor's high sensitivity for photoshop
and you'll be battling to keep the cur-
sor tame.
Gaming with this mouse was a lot
of fun; the glide is smooth as silk and
the accurate CPI (counts per inch)
for those “Headshots” had my friends
cursing me within minutes of start-
ing a TF2 game. They say the gear
doesn't make the gamer but this mouse
sure does help if you use it right (see
below).
By this point, you're probably aware
The SteelSeries Ikari: razor sharp?
I really like this mouse. However, if
you need it spelling out for you, this is
the best gaming mouse I've ever used!
There is no comparison with any non-
gaming mouse and beats the Razors
that my friends own hands down in
terms ergonomics and ease of use. So if
you are one those people gaming with
that old default mouse or just someone
who feels like an upgrade I cannot rec-
ommend this highly enough.
How to get the most out of your
gaming mouse:
• If you normally use a regular mouse
with inferior CPI, you'll probably no-
tice how zippy your gaming mouse
might appear – this is not the idea, re-
adjust the sensitivity lower so that it
feels comfortable again. You want to
be using the extra counts per
inchfor
accura-
cy, not
decreasng
the number
of inches you
have to move.
• Turn off
‘mouse acceler-
ation’ for games;
with this kind of
setting on, faster
movement increases
with distance moved
and this will undermine
the accuracy of your
mouse as well as degener-
ating your reaction/physi-
cal speed).

• Turn off ‘mouse smooth’; per-
haps preferential (Steel Series have
it as an option in their software), but
I feel it dumbs down your mouse's
high sensitivity by rounding off your
movements.
ter. To follow The Way of Jean Claude
Van Damme, you too must kill without
remorse, engaging each enemy in bru-
tal melee. Try tossing still-flailing op-
ponents at groups of enemies – instant
satisfaction guaranteed! Now get out
there and kick some ass.
The Way of the Anaesthesiologist
Maybe you haven't noticed that Crysis
has a tactical attachment that fires stun
darts. Well, it does, and it is the only
weapon of choice for the anaesthesi-
ologist (I should have chosen a shorter
name for this one...).
Dispatch your enemies, but only for
periods of a minute at a time, when
they will awake groggily to find you
have already passed. Carrying both
the SCAR and the AK is highly recom-
mended, allowing you to shoot opiates
faster than Heath Ledger (was that too
soon?).
Embark on the Path of the Crysis
Sebastian Nordgren completes his training and returns with words of wisdom and warning
I
liked Crysis, but I never thought
the aliens (yes, there are aliens,
if that was a spoiler you really
need to get up to date) were
too swanky and I didn't like
that there were no ways around them
other than by destroying them. I did,
however, love the first half or so of the
game, when your only enemies are Ko-
reans who, uncharacteristically for en-
emy AI, can't see you through bushes,
trees, rocks or mountains. This led me
to experiment with a variety of differ-
ent ways of playing this section, par-
ticularily on the first level. Here are
some challenges for those who thought
the vanilla Crysis experience wasn't
enough.
The Way of the Ninja
You may think that ninjas don't ex-
ist anymore. You are mistaken. For
proof, look behind you. Whoops, too
slow! Ninjas are stealthy assassins, and
so must you be to follow The Way of
the Ninja. Except minus the assassin
part, because you're not supposed to
kill anyone. You're also not supposed
to be spotted by anyone (because if
you were, that wouldn't be very ninja,
would it?). Use your nanosuit stealth to
your advantage and duck from cover
to cover, always in the shadows, always
mere feet away from your unsuspect-
ing enemies. Enemies whom you shall
leave alone, not out of mercy, no, but
because your Way is one of enlighten-
ment and patience. Venture forth and
be like the shadows!
The Way of Jean-Claude van
Damme
Van Damme, being the greatest action
hero ever (ever), takes no prisoners.
He also has no use for firearms of any
sort, dispatching his enemies by swiftly
breaking their limbs – if that limb hap-
pens to be their neck, so much the bet-
The Way of Sam Fisher
Sam Fisher is a stealthy assassin of
Splinter Cell fame, but unlike the ninja
whose powers of stealth extend into
the supernatural, Sam is a mere mortal
who still wishes to remain undetected.
To this end, he only ever dispatches
enemies using his trusty silenced side-
arm, and so must you too to follow The
Way of Sam Fisher. Acquire two such
pistols, creep from the shadows and
deliver a classic 2-1 tap: 2 in the chest,
1 in the head. Now you too can get
double-crossed by the US government
and thrown in an African prison, left
to plot your revenge on your former
masters!
The Way of Tommy the Turtle
After jumping out of your plane, you
land in the water just off a small beach.
On this beach is a turtle, Tommy. He
is your new best friend, in fact, he is
your only friend. Tommy doesn't care if
you kill, maim or dismember your en-
emies, but insists on coming with you
wherever you go. Unfortunately for
you (and Tommy), Tommy can't walk
very quickly, so it falls to you to carry
him with you wherever you go. And
should Tommy die from a stray bullet,
you should terminate the guilty with
extreme prejudice, then take his lifeless
corpse with you as a testament to the
bravery of the only creature who ever
truly understood you. Bury him on a
mountain overlooking the island that
he knew as home – a place now fraught
with your anguish for failing Tommy.
Throw yourself off that same moun-
tain, for life can never be the same.
Now, go out into the world of Cry-
sis and experiment – perhaps you too
shall discover another Way, in which
case we'd be very happy to hear about.
Perhaps the Way of the Bunny beck-
ons? Or the Way of the Snake? But I
will not slow down your progress into
the self-discovery inherent in the Ways
by telling you too much too soon. Ven-
ture out and find for thyself.
He’s so good, we can’t see him
Aww, look at him sleep... noob
