Science
As bacteria go, anthrax is pretty un-
pleasant. Not only can it enter the hu-
man body via the skin, or through the
digestive system, but also via the lungs
– unusually for a bacterium, anthrax
can create spores, able to survive for
very long times outside a host, turning
back into bacteria when they re-enter.
If enough of these spores are inhaled,
pulmonary anthrax, a particularly fatal
form of the disease, can develop. Cou-
pled with the ease with which airborne
spores can be dispersed, these charac-
teristics make "weaponised" anthrax a
formidable biological weapon, capable
of rendering infected areas uninhabit-
able for decades.
What the bacteria
do inside the
body is no less
sordid. As
they travel
from the in-
fection site,
they emit a
toxic three-part
cocktail of proteins,
one part of which, the pro-
tective antigen, is able to help the
other two parts – the lethal and oede-
ma factors – inside cells, where they
can wreak havoc.
Not only does this allow the bacte-
ria to ward off attempts by the body's
force of "cleaner" phagocyte cells to
destroy them, but recent studies have
also shown that a combination of the
lethal factor and the antigen, known
as lethal toxin (LeTx) is responsible
for typical anthrax symptoms such as
blood-vessel leakages and the build-up
of fluid surrounding the lungs.
It's the details of how LeTx causes
blood vessels to leak which Robert E.
Bolcome III and other colleagues from
the Harvard Medical School set out to
investigate. As reported recently in the
Proceedings of the National Academy
of Sciences, one of the problems they
had to overcome lay in finding a suit-
able "model" – mammal blood-vessels
are bur-
ied within
opaque tissues, preventing the effect
of the toxin on live vessels from being
monitored over time. Observations
Vein melter: Anthrax and zebrafish embryos
Monitoring what anthrax does to zebrafish veins might help improve treatments for the disease in humans
can only be made via dissections, pre-
venting successive measurements on
the same animal.
Zebrafish embryos, however, are
transparent, and so it is possible to
monitor the blood flow in
their vessels without re-
sorting to invasive tech-
niques – it can be done
remotely, using
fluorescence mi-
croscopy. This
relies on injecting
fluorescent poly-
mer microspheres
a few hundred nanome-
tres wide into the embryos' vessels –
when il-
luminated, these
microspheres show up as
bright spots in images of the embryos,
spots whose progress can be followed
over time without killing the fish.
Using this technique on two day-

old zebrafish
embryos, the re-
searchers were
able to show that
LeTx caused three
types of reaction
in the fish, each re-
action class being de-
fined by the circulation present
20 hours after the toxin was injected.
"Wild-type" cases had normal circula-
tion, mild cases showed reduced cir-
culation, whilst severe cases had no
circulation at all.
Monitoring the
progress of embryos over
time, the researchers found this re-
duction in circulation was associated
with leaking vessel walls – almost all
embryos with poor circulation showed
microspheres escaping the vessels.
However, using acridine orange, a
dye which allows living and dead cells
to be distinguished, it was seen that
these leakages occurred without
the cells which make up the ves-
sel walls dying – something else
was responsible for the leaks.
The culprit turned out
to be particular chemical
pathway, known to be impli-
cated in vessel permeability. By
blocking this VEGFR pathway,
the researchers were able to
reduce the numbers of em-
bryos in the mild and severe
categories.
This suggests that the
VEGFR pathway is worth ex-
ploring further – the scien-
tists conclude that targeting
this pathway may increase
the effectiveness of anthrax
treatments in humans. Fur-
thermore, as vessel leakage
occurs in a number of
other diseases, such as
Ebola or haemorrhagic
fever, they suggest simi-
lar studies would be
worth pursuing in
those cases – un-
derstanding the
role vessels play
may in fact yield a rich
vein of techniques for tackling these
afflictions. Enough to make it worth
turning any number of zebrafish green
around the gills.
