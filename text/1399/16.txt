Turnout was up considerably on the
previous few years with 2314 students
voting in the Presidential election. In
addition to the full-time posts Kadim
Shubber and Jamie Henry were elected
as Student Trustees of Imperial College
Union.
Elections for delegates to NUS Annual
Conference were also held and the 8
students who will join me at this event in
Blackpool over the Easter break are
Jennifer Morgan Camilla Royle
Kirsty Patterson Jon Matthews
Ashley Brown Luke Taylor
Victoria Gibbs Elizabeth Hyde
Well done to all the winners and
commiserations to all the unsuccessful
candidates who can take pride in the fact
that they contributed so much towards
the electoral process. Thanks also to
Daniel McGuinness who filled the role of
Returning Officer
and the elections
committee who
ensured that the
elections ran
without any major
hitches.
On a slightly
more sombre
note
Last week a lot of you who came back
to the Union after the Varsity Rugby
match were very disappointed that
the bar closed slightly earlier than was
advertised. On behalf of the Union
I would like to offer an unreserved
apology for this error – especially to
the sports clubs some of which went
to a lot of effort to get their members
involved in Varsity Day. As a gesture of
goodwill towards students who were
inconvenienced last Wednesday we
are halving the price of entry to our end
of term carnival on Wednesday 19th
March. Tickets will now be on sale for £4
instead of £8. Once again I would like to
apologise to those of you who had a bad
ending to a wonderful day of Sport.
More Elections (last mention
this term, honest)
Due to technical difficulties the Union,
RCSU and CGCU elections that were
advertised 2 weeks ago are postponed
until next term. Look out for details of
the new elections timetable after the
Easter break.
