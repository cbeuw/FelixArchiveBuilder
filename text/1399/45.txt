Processed food – what is it
and what does it do for us?
Any food that you can buy in a can, jar,
packet or bottle is processed food. That
is, food that has been altered from the
way in which nature presented it to
us, in some kind of factory, as part of
a bulk process. It is believed that all
processed food is bad for our health in
different degrees, and it is best avoided
from our diet altogether.
There are three big problems with
processed food – what is added, what
is removed and what is left. In short,
the whole thing.
Food additives are what are added to
processed food. These have been used
by for centuries. Salt, sugar and vinegar
were among the first used to preserve
foods. However, in the past 30 years,
with the prominence of processed
foods, there has been a massive explo-
sion of foods with additives, which is a
much more serious problem.
Additives are used in food to keep it
lasting longer and to make it taste, look
and smell like something that it is not.
They enable food to sit on a supermar-
ket shelf, or in our cupboards, for sev-
eral months without going bad.
Processed foods have been altered
from their natural state for safety rea-
sons and for convenience. The meth-
ods used for processing foods include
canning, freezing, refrigeration, dehy-
dration and aseptic processing.
We tend to think of processed foods
as bad, but it turns out that many proc-
essed foods are not unhealthy. For
example, milk would be considered a
processed food because it is pasteur-
ized to kill bacteria and homogenized
to keep fats from separating. While
some people prefer to drink raw milk,
most of us should consume the “proc-
essed” version we find in our grocery
stores.
Another healthy example of food
processing is frozen vegetables. While
fresh may be best, freezing vegetables
preserves vitamins and minerals and
makes them convenient to cook and
eat all year around. Fruit and vegeta-
ble juice is also an example of a healthy
processed food. In fact, some orange
juice is fortified with calcium to make
it even more nutritious.
Of course, there are a lot of proc-
essed foods that aren’t good for you.
Many processed foods are made with
trans fats, saturated fats, and large
amounts of sodium and sugar. These
types of foods should be avoided, or at
least eaten sparingly. Processed foods
that may not be as healthy as fresh
foods include:
• Canned foods with lots of
sodium
• White breads and pastas made
with refined white flour, which are
not as healthy as those made with
whole grains
• Packaged high-calorie snack
foods, like chips and cheese snacks
• High-fat convenience foods, like
cans of ravioli
• Frozen fish sticks and frozen
dinners
• Packaged cakes and cookies
• Boxed meal mixes
• Sugary breakfast cereals
• Processed meats
Processed foods and pre-packaged
meals are very convenient and popular.
If you do shop for these foods, be sure
to look for products that are made with
whole grains, low in sodium and calo-
ries, and free of trans fats. Make sure
you pay attention to serving size, too,
and balance out the processed foods
you eat with a delicious fresh salad and
some whole grain bread. We should
eat as many raw foods as we can daily.
Adding fresh fruits and vegetables to
our meals and snacks is an easy way to
accomplish this.
Eliminating all processed food is
probably not going to happen for most
of us. But we can make better food
choices and supplement our diets with
missing components. We can opt for
the apple over the apple juice. We can
choose a baked potato or salad over
chips. We can choose whole-grain
bread over white bread. We can take
the time to read food labels. Chanc-
es are if you can’t pronounce it, you
shouldn’t be eating it. We can choose
processed foods with a very short list
of ingredients; the longer the list, the
more processing involved, and the
more nutrition lost.
Our bodies are amazing, capable
of extraordinary things. They are de-
signed to filter out toxins at a fast rate.
They have a highly sophisticated de-
fence system. They have an amazing
ability to recover from serious damage.
The key lies in providing our bodies
with the necessary building blocks to
accomplish what they were designed to
do-to keep us alive!

This week, I’m going to talk about how
interval training is an effective way to
increase your general and sport related
fitness amongst other things and that
we don’t have to do the same things
we’ve always done in the gym if they’re
not getting us the results we are after.
You may never have heard of interval
training before but it’s the objective of
this article to add an effective method
for you to get into even better shape, so
let’s start off with the basics.
Put simply, Interval training is an
interval of hard work followed by an
interval of easier work repeated for
the desired time. Some of this article
will compare interval training to long
duration steady state cardiovascular
work (40 minutes + on a cardiovascu-
lar machine). This is not to say steady
state cardiovascular work hasn’t got its
place, indeed, before you try interval
training I would suggest you have some
degree of aerobic fitness developed by
steady state work done on a cardio ma-
chine (the treadmill, rower, bike etc…)
Interval training has been around
for many years but gained wider pop-
ularity around the early 1950’s when
a Czechoslovakian athlete famed for
his gruelling interval workouts won a
number of gold medals in the Olym-
pics of 1948 and 1952. So for people
playing sports, interval training also
has a high carryover as in many sports
you don’t move at the same speed all
the time sometimes you may sprint
other times stand still etc. Even for
long distance sports like the marathon,
interval training has been proved to in-
crease top speed, acceleration and the
ability to sprint finish!
Interval training utilises the aerobic
system and the anaerobic or alactic
system (depending on the nature of
the intervals) to produce energy. In the
hard interval the anaerobic or alactic
system will be the main system work-
ing while when in the easier interval
the aerobic system will be working,
what this means is the easier interval
is needed for recovery so you can con-
tinue with the high amount of intensity
in the hard interval.
Many studies have been carried out
on interval training – one study com-
pared three 20 minute interval sessions
a week with three 60-90 minute steady
state aerobic sessions a week with both
groups improving the same amount, so
in terms of saving time with interval
training you could get the same results
nearly 5 times quicker!
Increases in fitness, a higher body fat
% loss and a higher increase in metabo-
lism are just some of the other findings
for interval training, one study found
that after just two weeks fat oxidation
had improved by 36% with interval
training!
Below are some examples of how you
can start interval training, this is just
a guide and will change depending on
your goals and fitness levels.
Remember this is not to say you
should never do steady state aerobic
work, only that there are definite ad-
vantages to varying the things you do
and interval training is just another
tool in your toolbox you can use to
achieve your fitness goals.
