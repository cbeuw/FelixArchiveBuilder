There was fire in the bellies of the RSM
during the warm up and by kick off in-
sanity ruled the bodies and minds of
the Royal Miners. A poor kick from
CSM saw the first scrum of the game
on the half way line. Historically, the
CSM have had dominant forwards,
however, a clean pick up from Flan-
nan O’Mahony caught Camborne off
guard. A short pop to Rob Phillipps set
him carving up the defence, followed
by a chip and chase. The perfectly
placed kick slowed just over the line,
Phillipps following all the way to make
the grounding; 5-0 to RSM after 30
seconds of play. Understandably CSM
did not take kindly to this and came
back strong, running their forwards
phase after phase into the RSM pack.
Camborne were kept at bay with big
tackles (the only type seen in the Bot-
tle Match) from the second rows, Ben
Moorehouse and Stephen MacAttack.
Keeping discipline, the RSM waited
for the opposition to make mistakes,
followed by precision kicks from the
RSM fly half to relieve pressure. A
slow kick from CSM number 10 was
charged down by Joe Brown, with their
full back unable to retrieve it, Brown
hacked it through once more, collected
and scored, putting the RSM into the
lead by 10 points.

On the 23rd February 2008, the mighty
RSM ladies Hockey team had made it
down to the deep wilds of the south-
ern, in bred, daffodil growing region
of Cornwall (yes Susie that’s right!! ..
it’s the county we were in!) any way I
digress..
The team woke up at the never before
seen hour of 6.45 (who knew?!) and
made their way downstairs to await the
coach, which duly arrived complete
with windscreen wipers.
On arrival the CSM team appeared
to be undertaking some interesting
scare-tactics in the form of stretching
exercises. Of course we ladies fear not
for that kind of caper, since we had al-
ready warmed our voices and muscles
up at the pre bottle match bar night
(CSM idiots!)
The match began with frightening
battle cries and a push back by Sangy.
We knew the war of the two sides had
begun as ‘banter’ from both sides began
to ring in our ears. The first half was
an incredible match of skill from both
sides, with some excellent passes being
made and some awesome runs. Many
a time did we get the ball into their D
and frightened the goalie. However, at
half time, the score was 0-0. We had
rattled their sub-standard cages.. in
fact so much they were actually yelling
and shouting at each other and not at
us (we’re just THAT good!).
After a half time speech by Sammy
and Charlotte and a quick team re-
shuffle we were ready to rock again.
Unfortunately, the Chunky Social
Miscreants scored 2 goals in a row.
B*atches.
Not taking any of this rubbish from
the Camborners we fought back and
soon after the amazing skills of Miss
Sarah, came out in force. The goal
was a beauty, pure gold.. the short was
taken and crack.. right in the back of
the D… they didn’t know what was
coming! Play continued with an amaz-
ing goal from Susie-Q who, at the goal
post, neatly walloped the goal past the
feet of the blundering goalie.
The game was on! However, CSM
scored a 3rd goal that was definitely
over the backboard!!! Crip threw a
rightful glare of hat at the ump, ripping
off her helmet (so play had to stop) and
promptly refusing to put it back on un-
til she’d been heard and the decision
reversed. She got a green card.
The author asks why no-one remem-
bers Sammy doing a Green pint, clear-
ly this needs rectifying! The evils then
scored a forth goal (cheeting wotsits)
and time was called; only after Emma
thumped a girl in the shin for being as
ugly as sin.
A good game by all we fought hard
and nearly reached the ultimate goal of
that cup! Next year we’ll back, better
than before and we will win it, oh yes.
We’ll drink champagne, absinthe, beer
and Crème de Menthe (for sammy)
from that cup and guard it with our
drunken lives from the cheating scum-
bag hags from Cornwall.
Congratulations to all who played,
definitely one of our best matches of
this year, I only hope our supporters
didn’t make them cry too much, not!
This was always going to be a tough
match as we had players missing and
players on injuries but I still feel we had
a chance. Camborne decided though
that they weren’t going to play fair and
play only 2 CSM players, the rest being
ringers.
We arrived to the ground with plenty
of time so watched the first half of our
heroic hockey players for inspiration in
the battle that lay before us. We had to
find our own changing room of which
the only one free was the ladies’ (clear-
ly some poor attempt at psychological
warfare from Camborne). But we ral-
lied ourselves and marched out as one
to the pitch to have our warmup. The
first thing that we noticed was how ut-
terly crap the pitch was, it had lines all
over it like a tractor had been let loose.
The second thing we noticed was the
high level of organisation Camborne
had, they were a team with only one
goal (well actually lots more but I’ll get
onto that) and that was to win.
A few minutes before the hockey
finished the ref called both captains
over and I won the toss and decided
to stay the way we were facing. The
game kicked off and it was clear Cam-
borne were stronger than us showing
slick passing and a strong desire to win
the ball back if anything went astray. It
wasn’t long before they got their first
goal and then not long after got their
second. And then as if it couldn’t get
any worse poor Dave Holder was taken
off to hospital in an ambulance forc-
ing a substitution and a slight change
of formation. I cant really remember
the order of events after this up to half
time but we conceded another headed
goal owing to their superior aerial abil-
ity, suffered another injury forcing a
substitution and then Nic English was
booked. The challenge was most prob-
ably a bookable offence but a Cam-
borne player had commited a far more
cynical foul moments earlier and got
away unpunished.
At half time I did not have many op-
tions so all I could say is to get stuck
in as it was the only way we would get
back into this, if we didn’t we were go-
ing to lose.
For the beginning of the second
half this seemed to work in holding
the score as it was and not conceding
for 10/15 minutes. Rowan Baker (our
keeper) pulled off some amazing saves
and won every one on one. But then
a wonderful through ball completely
unlocked us allowing them another
one on one which they finished well.
To compound the misery we suffered
an injury to one of our players that was
subbed on earlier, we were down to
10 players for a while as our final sub
was not ready (he wasn’t originally go-
ing to play). We managed to stabilise
things for another short while but they
won a free kick about 35/40 yards out,
they pitched the ball into the area and
Gerry Vega put the ball gloriously into
his own net with a header any attacker
would be proud of. After this the game
lost any momentum still left but there
was still time for Camborne to make
another through-ball which they fin-
ished and we got another booking as
Footballers schooled by CSM
Stu Walters put in a late tackle that
their player whinged like a little girl
about.
At the final whistle we congratulated
Camborne on their win and then had
to make a swift exit to get to the rugby
without even having time to shower. As
for man of the match, we voted Cam-
borne’s number 14 who bossed the
game from start to finish in the centre,
and they voted for Rowan our keeper
for a solid performance despite con-
ceding more than he would’ve liked to.
Next year though, they will be beaten.

CSM were becoming predictable
with cross-field kicks from their fly
half, most of which to no benefit with
RSMrunningitstraightback.Onekick,
however, bounced into touch inside the
Royal’s 22. A quick line out from RSM
saw the catcher isolated from the rest
of the forwards; turn over and CSM
had the ball in a dangerous position.
Enthusiastic, over-committing to the
subsequent rucks gave CSM an over-
lap, quick ball to their number 8 put
him in for a try. A missed conversion
and the score sheet read 10-5. Attack-
ing runs from centres, Nathan Alliston
and Adam Foley, and quick rucking
from the back rows, Mark Sanders and
Richard Simons, gave RSM a strong
platform. CSM gave away a penalty
which gave a line-out on the CSM five
yard line. The ball was collected by
CSM however superb ripping of the
ball from McLellan gave the ball back
to RSM. CSM then penalised for play-
ing the ball on the floor put the RSM
in striking distance of the posts. A
beautiful kick from James Stewart and
the ball was neatly slotted between the

uprights; 13-5. Despite relentless at-
tempts from the home team, the score
remained unchanged at half time.
The second half started without
O’Mahony, who was receiving atten-
tion from paramedics for a head injury.
This allowed one of last year heroes,
Simon Jones, on the pitch to put his
stamp on the game. The CSM kept the
ball under their jumpers, keeping it
tight in their forwards. Tough scrum-
maging from the RSM gave the CSM
scrappy ball, but they held possession,
forcing penalty after penalty ten yards
from the RSM line. Massive tackles
ensued, with the most unlikely of play-
ers guarding the CSM slow ball. The
ball was held up twice over the line,
but the tough defence failed, and CSM
capitalised, scoring a well deserved try;
13-10. There was definitely a feeling of
panic through the RSM camp, how-
ever, pressure was relieved whenever
the ball went wide, through the RSM
hands, with Tim Chalk making yards
each time down the wing.
End to end rugby followed, never-
theless the final whistle was looming
and CSM were getting desperate. A
big push in the scrum from Orlando
Brown, and instinctive hook from
Thomas Coggrave saw the CSM pack
turned over for the first time. With a
scrum inside the CSM half, the RSM
smashed the ball up the middle with
the demolition ball; Nathan Alliston.
After smashing two of the CSM out
of the way, a delicate touch put him in
a position with only one man to beat.
Alliston chooses neither left nor right
and goes for the central option into
the CSM fullback. Unfortunately the
ball slipped and was not grounded, a
scrum follows and CSM have one fi-
nal attempt, trying to run it from be-
hind their own line. A knock on in fear
of the RSM hits and the final whistle
blows; RSM win 13:10; pitch invasion
as a consequence and the Bottle is re-
turned to its rightful owner- the RSM.
Ladies just miss out
Nice dress!
