H
ahaha – the NME
Awards. Now I know I
said I didn’t care about
them, I know I’m being
a hypocrite, but this is
too good to resist. The winners of the
Shockwaves NME Awards 2008 were
announced last week to much pomp
and fanfare, confirming in the process
the rumours that the popular alterna-
tive music scene has indeed ascended
up its own arse and disappeared into an
infinite loop of self-congratulation and
self-importance. The situation is simi-
lar to the game ‘Portal’, except instead
of shooting portals, you shoot arses.
And instead of the premise of the game
being to escape from the test facility, it
is to give kudos to awful bands and to
make me generally depressed. And in-
stead of Weighted Companion Cubes,
you have…etc.
I wasn’t expecting a sudden epiphany
on NME’s part this year – it was ob-
vious they were going to give awards
such as ‘Best Album’, ‘Best Radio Show’
and ‘Best Dressed’ to celebrities with
mediocre albums (Klaxons – ‘Myths
of the Near Future’), mediocre radio
shows (Zane Lowe) and questionable
dress senses (Noel Fielding). It’s not like
I was eagerly awaiting the announce-
ment of the winners so I could engage
in the ritual berating of the NME and
the lamentation of the loss of times
gone by when it was the real alterna-
tive, which of course accompanies the
event every year. No, the reason I am
condescending to mention the NME
Awards is because, ironically, of their
non-music awards, which serve as a
troubling illustration of the mindset of
the readership (outside of poor musi-
cal taste).
A prime example is Pete Doherty,
the troubled young poet (no less than
half an English Literature degree to his
name) and frontman of indie group
Babyshambles, took home the ‘Hero
of the Year’ award. All congratulations
are due to the man who managed to
not smoke crack or shoot up heroin for
an entire year. Perhaps if we all took his
example and stopped smoking crack
and shooting up heroin, we too could
be recipients of this prestigious acco-
lade. Not to mention get a lot more
done.
Furthermore, the award for ‘Best Live
Event’ went to the corporate-sellout-
prepubescent-indie-scenester-£130-
per-ticket-rapefest(s), the ‘Carling
Weekend: Reading and Leeds Festivals’.
For those who haven’t attended, there is
actually an NME-sponsored stage (the
‘NME Stage’) at the festival, so it is not
much of a surprise this got a mention
but I’m sure we would all appreciate it
if they were a bit more subtle and a bit
less shameless with their advertising.
I was going to stop but OK one more.
‘Villain of the Year’ went, for the third
year running, to George W. Bush. Why?
I have absolutely no idea. Neither does
the NME. Neither does anyone.
I’m really sorry. I promise the next
column I write will be about some-
thing I like and I won’t mention NME.
I don’t enjoy being grumpy. I just need
to calm down and relax, smoke some
crack and shoot up some heroin, and
the next column will be lovely.

TheCardigans,oneofthemostsuccess-
ful musical exports from a nation that
brought us super-giants like Abba and
The Hives, are set to release their top-
drawer gems in their greatest album.
Thumbs up. With over six million
albums sales in the bag and a music
career spanning 14 years, is it re-
ally any wonder that The Cardigans
have received numerous accolades
and a widespread fan-base? Best Of
is the long anticipated amalgama-
tion of the band’s twenty-one or so
finest hits taken from their past six
studio albums, comprising huge
stormers like ‘Lovefool’ (from the
album ‘First Band on the Moon’)
which featured in Baz Luhrmann’s
blockbuster romantic tragedy that
is Romeo and Juliet. Having been
catapulted to international stardom
by this track, The Cardigans con-
tinued to go from strength to strength
with established classic tracks such as
‘Erase/Rewind,’ ‘My Favourite Game,’
‘Carnival’ and more recently, corkers
including ‘I
Need
Some Fine Wine and You Need to be
Nicer.’
The Cardigans are greatly defined by
their lead singer. Nina Persson’s promi-
nent vocals show remarkable versatili-
ty, playful and coquettish with a strong
hint of longing on tracks like ‘Lovefool’
(with its saccharine and teasing tone-
“Love me, love me, say that you’ll love
me” combined with the dynamic disco
beats, making it highly infectious and
exceedingly memorable) or raw and
somewhat dark and edgy on the lines
of ‘My Favourite Game’ and ‘War.’
This greatest album is
suitably chronologi-
cally arranged,
beginning with
early material
taken from
their debut
album Em-
merdale.‘Rise
& Shine’ and
‘Sick and
Tired’ are
both quin-
tessentially
light-heart-
ed, remi-
niscent of
breezy,
sunny summer days with
the appearance of jangling,
Smiths-esque guitars, a quick tempo,
strong sense of rhythm, epitomizing
the pleasantly upbeat feel-good factor
that is the hallmark of their music. The
sanguine atmospherics are then re-
placed in the wake of langourous sleep.
The achingly-beautiful ‘After All,’
conjures a jazzy, lounge piano bar
backdrop – Persson’s coaxing
cooing simply oozes longing,
whilst conveying a palpa-
ble sense of hopelessness
that is tinged with fra-
gility – “On a night like
this, you can hear the
words, see behind the
word”’
Their second album,
Live, sold obscene
amounts in 1995. This is
the LP that fundamentally got both
fans and critics alike, all around the
globe, to take imminent notice with
Cardigans release best of...

‘Carnival’ and ‘Daddy’s Car’ emerging
as attention grabbing tracks, solid in
terms of the rich texture, with many
splashes of colour provided by splen-
did string refrains, use of synthesiz-
ers and guitar hooks, irresistibly
putting a huge happy grin on
your face.
A change in direction from
the bright and chirpy melodies
present in previous albums
lead to Gran Turismo, where
The Cardigans adopt consid-
erably more moody sound-
scapes. Ultimately, it gave
rise to the rather addictive
hit – ‘Erase/Rewind,’ with
its sultry, purring vocals,
ambient electronics,
subtle back beat and
‘Higher’ being ‘their
closest to Gospel’ com-
ing from the horse’s
mouth, Surprisingly,
having listened care-
fully, the intimate na-
ture of this reflective
piece is putatively
spiritual. Other

ing the long
odyssey that
relationships
entail,‘thegood
times and the
bad times, which is
inextricably linked
to booze, with refer-
ences to the all too often, ill
effects of high alcohol consumption.
One does not need to hesitate to say
that Best Of brings together a well-
chosen compilation of treasures from
a vast collection by The Cardigans.

Koko: A majestic venue for a mesmer-
ising band. Well that’s what I thought
until last minute announcements were
made that age restrictions were be-
ing scrapped, filling Camden’s palace
with sweaty children running around
in a neon blur of glowsticks and tacky
jackets.
The Shockwave NME tours aren’t
just about the headliners. The line-up
for all the gigs have been impressive
this year, but Cut Copy really take to
their own becoming more than just
a support act. They weren’t there to
warm up the audience, although that
was done without them breaking into
sweat, they were there to play for their
fans who seemed to be as interested
in their glockenspiel-popping beats as
they were in the main act.
Hadouken! stormed the stage and in
a mist of flying glowsticks and sound-
ing the alarm bells they launch straight
into ‘Bounce’, making even the pre-pu-
bescent teens ‘bounce their balls.’ The
stylish Alice Spooner seems to be the
backbone of this band, pumping out
the synths that make Hadouken! who
they are.
Named after one of the greatest
moves in Saga Megadrive’s Street
Fighter (three older brothers and a
childhood of consoles teach a girl
something) these guys can really throw
a punch. Each song is a new explosion
of energy knocking the audience into a
frenzy.
With a debut album set for release,
vocalist James Smith tests the wa-
ter with a few new tracks that show
Hadouken! will last, and that their in-
die grime synth metallic mind-blowing
noise can create more than the odd
hit. And then more of the ‘old’, ‘Danc-
ing lesson,’ ‘Liquid Lives’ and of course
the legendary ‘Tuning in’ before the
beats of ‘That Boy That Girl’ called for
bedtime for all the ‘Hoxton Heros’ and
‘Indie Cindies’ – there was school the
next day after all. This last blow from
the band threw the audience into a fi-
nal cyclone and set me up for a kebab!
