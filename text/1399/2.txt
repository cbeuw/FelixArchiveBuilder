Imperial’s Ring of Steel
expands to the bicycle sheds
Ongoing thefts prompts tighter security to Blue Cube bike store
Security is being increased on the
Faculty Building bicycle store due to
persistent thefts. The current security
mechanisms in place are proving inef-
fective at deterring criminals; thieves
are simply tailgating users who swipe
their College ID card to open the exist-
ing barrier.
College plans to install a full-height
turnstile system, similar to those at
football grounds. Students and staff
will have to swipe in, one person at
a time, whilst pushing their bicycle
through. Entry cannot be gained with-
out a swipe card.
Students have expressed concern
to Felix questioning the need for the
turnstiles and how they’re going to be
bike-friendly. College has said that bi-
cycles are far more secure in the store
than attached to one of the open racks
around campus and whilst there will
be delays to users moving in and out of
the store, the added security is a wor-
thy trade-off.
Similar plans are in motion for the
Queen’s Gate bicycle store in between
the Huxley and Blackett Laboratory
buildings.
Installation work on the Faculty
Building store will commence on 26th
March and should last for around ten
days. During this time, access to the
store will only be granted from 8-10am
and 4-6pm through the fire exit on
Unwin Road. Cyclists will need to pro-
vide their College ID card to security
guards to gain entrance. The fire doors
will remain closed and unmanned dur-
ing the weekend beginning Saturday
29th March.
Phew. If you haven’t already done so,
look across the page and laugh at the
people covered in shaving foam, then
have a read. Otherwise, go and read
Angry Geek Idol in the Comments sec-
tion. It’s far more interesting. There’s
even some references to sex!

£412,100: Finalised Clubs &
Societies Budget 2008-2009
Current Central & Faculty
Union elections cancelled
The Clubs and Societies Board (CSB)
has finalised its budget for the next
year at £412,100, of which £359,00 is
marked for Clubs and Societies budg-
ets, increasing the funding given to
most clubs.
The marathon CSB Budgeting ses-
sions are legendary for their gruelling
length and this year was no exception,
lasting a little over 5 hours. Most Clubs
and Societies Committees (CSCs) and
Faculty Unions (FUs) came away with
increases in their budgets too, with
only the Overseas Clubs Committee,
Wye, and Media Group having their
budgets cut.
Media Group’s budget cut is soley
due to the removal of Felix’s grant,
an annual amount that is intended to
pay for the printing of the first issues
of the year. Felix is now effectively
self-funding with advertising revenue,
apart from the Sabbatical salary, prop-
erty rental and phone/internet serv-
Faculty union elections for the CGCU,
RCSU and the Central ICU elections
have been cancelled after an unfortu-
nately timed staff holiday which led
to the Union being unable to find a
complete list of fully sec-
onded candi-
dates.
Without this
list, they have been un-
able to hold a candidates meeting
to brief the contenders for the various
positions.
Given this situation ICU President,
Stephen Brown has cancelled the cur-
rent round of elections deeming them
“exceptional circumstances,” promising
ices which will still be funded by the
Union.
The increase in the total budget is
approximately 3%, with an effective in-
crease of 0.5% in the total budget after
inflation (~2.5%) is accounted for.
to run them at the beginning of
next term once the farce
has subsided.
The Faculty Union elec-
tions and various other positions that
are up for grabs are an integral part of
the Union: Elected officials with whom
students come into daily contact.
As the first farce of this year, Union
officials are relieved that the Sabbatical
elections ran smoothly (see over the
page) and were not affected. Wheth-
er confidence in the elections will be
damaged by the cancellation remains
to be seen.

long-term sufferer, or it’s been triggered since you began university

hear from you to see how you’re finding it at Imperial and how well
