Hangman and Lionel Richie
managed to sneak through
into Imperial College Union
this week, after pretending they were
going to the Felix office but instead
heading straight for FiveSixEight.
They managed to get away without
paying the entry fee, and, microphone
and fake membership card in hand,
they approached the bar to talk to
some of the pundits present.
Richie approached Wom Theeler,
Union President, and asked him just
how relevant he thought the Union
really is. He replied jovially, “Let
me tell you something, it better be
Lionel Richie sneaks into Imperial College Union
relevant with the business I’m in!
Relevance is the word.”
However, when Richie asked him
if he thought if there is hope for
someone who isn’t a white tory male
to win Union President next year, he
mood went decidedly sour. “That’s a
bit of a shitty question, you’re trying
to ruin it for me,” he said, before
storming away.
Richie then approached Kiss Craye,
the Deputy President (Welfare Lad)
as he was swigging WKDs at the bar,
and asked him how his night was
going. “Yeah it’s a big night tonight,”
he hiccupped, before following with a
shot of whiskey. “It’s the biggest night
in Imperial College; Wednesdays are
huge.”
Craye then muttered something
in coherently about tampons, before
slumping off towards the South
Kensington casino.
Richie also spotted a couple of
rugby players sitting alone at a
table, half pint in hand, internship
applications screwed up around
them. Richie approached him and
asked what he was up to at the Union
tonight. “We’re all about the girls!”
they cheered, before downing their
drinks.

However, when Richie asked
them if they could get him in with
the ladies too, they shock their
heads sadly, explaining they were
permanently banned from the Royal
Veterinary College. “We’re big fans,
but they don’t want to hang out with
us.”
They then got up, smashed a few
windows and left for a coach waiting
outside.
Finally Richie approached a
computing student putting up
campaign posters, and asked if he
was hopeful about winning. Said the
student sadly, “I am running, but I’ll
be in a category with some hot girls,
so I don’t stand a chance.”
“I’m only really here with my two
friends because they want to meet
Kiss Craye.”
Richie hung around for another
hour or two, although no-one
recognised that he wasn’t a student,
so simply left a bit later, undetected.
He went to Wagamamas afterwards,
and recapped the evening.
“Well, I walked into the bar where
all the sabbs drink without the
security saying anything to me.
“Wom Theeler swore at me, but all
in all, it was a fantastic success!”
As the run up to the student
elections continues, Hangman
decided to investigate
why students are running for the
highly coveted sabbatical positions.
Hangman managed to hack into
the Union server, and chased down
those who had already nominated
themselves to find out why they were
so desperate for that golden year
working for Imperial College Union.
“Well, I’m coming to the end of
my biology degree, and I don’t see it
getting any better once I graduate,”
said one third year student, who
is currently running for the role
of Deputy President (Education).
Hangman interviewed them as they
were photocopying hundreds of black
and white flyers, unaware of the
obvious typo in her manifesto points.
“I’m not a big fan of learning or
podcasts or anything like that, but the
19k wage is really tempting.”
Hangman met up with a fourth
year Chemistry student, who
was struggling desperately with
Photoshop trying to remove some
spots from their chosen photo.
“I thought it would be a great
opportunity to do something
worthwhile and really make a
difference at my Union,” she pauses
before cracking up. “I can’t believe I
kept a straight face whilst saying that!
“Nah, I’m staying around mostly
for the free accommodation; since
the hall rent prices went up, living in
South Ken for another year without
spending a penny is immense.”
Hangman also spoke to a physics
first year student, who was deciding
between two different themes for
their campaign. Whilst toggling
between movie posters for The Wolf
of Wall Street and Fight Club, he
explained why he was going for the
role of Deputy President (Welfare):
“Man, the rumours I’ve heard about
Chris Kaye [the current DP(W)].
“Did you know that he once
convinced a whole subwarden team
to let this student keep swords in his
room? That sort of power must be
mental.”
Finally, hangman caught up
with a fourth year medical student,
who is considering running for
Union President. Whilst talking
to Hangman, she was planning her
social media campaign, complete with
a twitter profile, a Facebook page
and a website too. All boasted a stark
purple and yellow colour scheme.
“Yeah, I think I can win, I mean,
anyone could be President, so why
not me? I know this year’s President
is a white male, and I know last year’s
was too, and the year before, and,
well, the year before that….and, what?
The year before that too?”
She pauses, before continuing: “
Nah, I’m sure the students always
vote for the most competent and
qualified candidate,
“I don’t think being a woman
will hold me back! Imperial is a
really open minded and supportive
community.”
She shut her laptop, collected her
bag and told us she was off to drink
with the rugby team. “They’re nice
lads really, they never have a sleazy
word to say about women, not as far
as I am aware anyway.”
Hangman exclusive: students running for
sabbatical roles have selfish motives
