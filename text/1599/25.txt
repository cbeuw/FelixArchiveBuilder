Fred Fyles questions what’s real at the Duke of York’s The Nether
"Jeremy

simmering
production
with a
steady
hand"
“Any sufficiently advanced technology is
indistinguishable from magic”
– Arthur C. Clarke
While the advent of the
Internet Age has brought
with it a multitude of
wondrous things (the information
overload that is Wikipedia; an ability
to connect with people around the
globe in a matter of seconds; an
unending supply of cat videos), it
has also done something much more
sinister, allowing people to explore
their deepest, darkest desires. It is
this duality that playwright Jennifer
Haley explores in her ground-
breaking play The Nether, which,
following a sell-out run at the Royal
Court last year, has returned to
London’s Duke of York Theatre.
Set in 2050, a year that manages
to be simultaneously distant and
imminent, the premise of the play
is that the internet has evolved
into ‘The Nether’, a vast network
of individuals interacting in an
artificially generated cyberspace;
over time, more and more aspects
of life have passed over into The
Nether: schooling, industry, and even
humans, allowed to permanently
reside in this alternative universe
thanks to the use of complex life-
support machines in the ‘real world’.
Sadly, The Nether has also allowed
the base instincts of humanity
to flourish, and we follow law-
enforcement agent Morris (Amanda
Hale), as she tracks down the
mysterious ‘Poppa’, aka Sims (Stanley
Townsend), a programmer who has
created an electronic idyll called ‘The
Hideaway’. In this grotesque vision
of Victoriana, Poppa’s clients can
anonymously come and go, stopping
by to do unspeakable things to the
little girls who reside in the house.
Of course, none of the children
involved are real (although the
creepily charming Iris was played on
this occasion by gifted child actor Zoe
Borough, in a superb London debut),
they are simply pixels, complex
renderings of crinoline, silk, and
flesh; but Hayley asks whether this
really matters, and whether indulging
in such fantasies, even within the
confines of the imagination, is
beyond the pale of the law.
Amanda Hale is excellent in the
role of Morris, turning what could
be a mere collection of tropes (icy
and brittle high-flyer; dressed all
in black and sporting a facelift-
giving bun; emotionally distant
with daddy issues) into a three-
dimensional character, thanks to a
nuanced performance that perfectly
highlights the play’s subtleties. But
particular credit must go to David
Calder’s perverted Doyle and Stanley
Townsend’s blood-chilling Sims: it
is one thing to play a predator on
stage, quite another to make them
seem simultaneously sympathetic
and sickening. The cast work well
together, creating a multi-layered
character study in the middle of a
vortex of moral turpitude.
Jeremy Herrin, fresh from
producing Hilary Mantel’s Wolf
Hall and Bring Up The Bodies, directs
this simmering production with a
steady hand, helped immensely by
the talents of set designer Es Devlin,
whose technical trickery helps pull
off the juggling act of simultaneously
showing two locations. From the
harshly strip-lit interrogation office,
intimidating in its blankness, we
are thrown into the Arcadia of The
Hideaway, a beautiful gothic house,
whose lush surroundings blur and
bend in a series of mirrors like a
mirage, emphasising the ephemeral
nature of the online world.
The Nether is one of those special
plays that occupies a space in your
mind long after the curtain has
gone down. The destructive power
of cyberspace has always appealed
to speculative fiction authors, from
William Gibson, the originator of
the term, to Margaret Atwood, whose
Oryx and Crake sees people surfing
the web for live videos of suicides and
torture; however, as our technology
has progressed, the question of what
limits we can place on the internet’s
collective imagination has shifted
from speculation to reality. Haley
has created this play at a critical time,
raising questions about the regulation
of technology, the freedom internet
anonymity can bring, and even the
very nature of human relationships.
There is a duality between human
and avatar in The Nether, meaning
that everything we are presented
with is slightly askew; you can’t trust
everything you see, least of all on the
Internet.
Unlike other recent examples of
speculative fiction - such as Charlie
Brooker’s Black Mirror, which writer
Mallory Ortberg succinctly describes
as “what if phones, but too much” -
The Nether doesn’t act as some kind
of high-brow thought experiment
designed to highlight the perils of
Tinder, or Facebook; it is much
more pertinent than that, exploring
an issue that is already becoming a
problem. As Haley herself says, “it’s
happening”, citing the much-feted
Oculus Rift technology, and the
fact that in online roleplaying game
Second Life areas for child and adult
avatars have to be separated. In those
respects The Nether acts as both an
ominous prediction of the future, and
a timely warning for the present.
The Nether runs at the Duke of York’s
Theatre until 25th
April. Tickets from
£10
