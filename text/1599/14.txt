Jack Steadman reports on the events of
Hollywood’s annual back-slapping party
Birdman soars as Neil
Patrick Harris falls flat
“Tonight we celebrate
Hollywood’s best and
whitest… sorry, brightest.”
So began the 87th
Academy Awards,
with this year’s ceremony hosted in
the Dolby Theatre by Neil Patrick
Harris. A newcomer to the role of
host, Harris’ first zinger was widely
considered his best of the night –
once the joy of his opening musical
number faded, the laughs were a case
of diminishing returns.
It wasn’t for a lack of trying, either
– Harris was bold enough to re-
enact one of the central scenes from
Birdman (the night’s biggest winner),
appearing on stage in his tighty-
whiteys for one skit.
There was a tame (and slightly
nonsensical) jab at Harvey Weinstein
based off American Sniper, as well
as the oh-so-predictable ‘Reese
Witherspoon is “so lovely you could
eat her up with a spoon”’ quip.
There was nothing quite on the level
of Ellen DeGeneres’super-selfie last
year, or as acerbic as Seth MacFarlane
the year before. It was a weird
halfway-house, floating between
showtunes, snark, and sympathy,
and it never quite worked. It was
more than a little odd to see such an
unsteady performance from a man
whose hosting of the Tony Awards is
always a delight to see. Such is the way
of the Oscars, it seems.
The uneven tone carried over to
the rest of the night as well, further
cementing this as one of the weirdest
Oscar ceremonies for years.
Harris’ “best and whitest” jibe was
right on the money, acknowledging
one of the furores surrounding this
year’s nominations: the complete
snubbing of not only Selma, the film
of the 1965 Civil Rights march (and
ostensibly a Martin Luther King
biopic, although describing it thus
does the film a disservice), but any
actor of colour. All twenty of the
acting nominees were white.
In the year after 12 Years a Slave,
the searing criticism of America’s
past, won Best Picture (and Best
Supporting Actress, with a Best Actor
nomination), a similarly important
examination of the country’s sordid,
more recent history was almost
entirely overlooked, bar a token Best
Picture nod, in addition to one for
Best Original Song.
The awards themselves continue
to tiptoe that line between appearing
progressive and respectful, and
exposing a darker, less appealing side
to Hollywood. Selma did take home
the Best Original Song award, with
the artists responsible for the song
(Common and John Legend) seizing
the opportunity – with both their
performance and their acceptance
speech – to turn the song into a real
protest.
“Selma is now,” said Legend. “We
live in the most incarcerated country
in the world. There are more black
men incarcerated today than were in
slavery in 1850.” The references to
the current protests in Ferguson were
a powerful statement, and didn’t go
unnoticed by the outside world – one
of the main protest organisers in
Ferguson, Deray McKesson, described
Legend’s words as “a one-person
protest.”
There was another win for diversity
in the shape of Birdman’s repeated
victories. The Hispanic team behind
the film took home several of the big
awards, including Best Picture, Best
Director and Best Cinematography,
making this the second consecutive
year a Mexican director has taken
home the biggest prize in the
profession (after Alfonso Cuaron took
home Best Director for Gravity last
year).
All in all, a positive step forwards
for the Academy, but one that was
almost immediately stomped on by
a self-proclaimed liberal, Sean Penn.
Presenting the award, Penn quipped
“who gave this sonofabitch his green
card?”
A joke among old friends, perhaps,
with Penn having appeared in a 2003
film by Inarritu, but still undeniably
racist. It was an uncomfortable line
to hear, and one that managed the
unfortunate trick of immediately
undercutting the success of non-
whites.
Inarritu shrugged the line off,
making his own joke on Mexicans
winning Best Director two years in a
row, before taking the chance to turn
political.
He championed the rights of
Mexicans, both those resident
in Mexico and those who have
immigrated to the US, proclaiming
that “I hope that they can be treated
with respect of the ones who came
before and built this incredible
immigrant nation.”
It was a common theme on
the night, the use of acceptance
speeches to make powerful points.
J. K. Simmons was the first, urging
everyone in the theatre and at home
to call their parents – “don’t text,
don’t email” – and to “listen to them
for as long as they want to talk to
you.” It was a simple point, but a
strong one. And they only got better
from there.
Patricia Arquette used her speech
for Best Supporting Actress – the only
award Boyhood took home on the
night, to everyone’s mild surprise – to
promote equality, proclaiming “to
every woman who gave birth… it’s our
time to have wage equality once and
for all, and equal rights for women
of the United States of America!”
The audience were on their feet, and
rightly so.
The most notable speech to round
off the night was Graham Moore’s
as he collected the prize for Best
Adapted Screenplay. “When I was
16 years old I tried to kill myself
because I felt different and that I
didn’t belong,” he revealed. “Now
I’m standing here, and I want this
moment to be for that kid who feels
weird or different… Stay weird, and
then when it’s your turn, and you’re
the one standing on this stage, please
pass this message on.” Opinions about
the film aside, it was another strong
message in a night that was full of
them.
The acceptance speech for
CitizenFour, which took home Best
Documentary, was no exception,
as director Laura Poitras thanked
Edward Snowden, the documentary’s
subject, for his “disclosures [that]
aren’t only a threat to privacy, but
to democracy,” going on to credit all
“journalists who are exposing truth.”
Harris’ quip that Snowden “couldn’t
be here for some treason” sank like a
particularly wet balloon.
Other award winners proved
less dramatic or controversial in
their speeches – Eddie Redmayne’s
speech after winning Best Actor was
adorable, but nothing special beyond
his dedication of the award to “all
of those people around the world
battling ALS.”
Julianne Moore’s Best Actress
speech was equally gracious,replete
with a quip about how, if winning
an Oscar means “you live five years
"Harris’
“best and
whitest”
jibe was
right
on the
money."
"Birdman’s
repeated
victories
were a big
win for
diversity.”
