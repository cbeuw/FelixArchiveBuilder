"The idea
is to allow
people
to find
interesting
things and
learn new
stuff about
their city."
There is
this guy
who left
a Kite for
where you
can see the
best view
of Seattle
Have you ever heard a cool
place from a friend that’s
just around the corner from
where you pass by every day and
thought, wow, how come I never see
that?
Or have you ever found an amazing
place tucked away in a city that you
think you know everything about and
wanted to share it to the world?
Whether the answers to both
questions are correct, then Kites is
the app for you. It allow users to view
and write short recommendations
anywhere in the world.
Most interesting of all to us,
however, is that the founder Krishan
Patel started the apps during his
underground Computing course as
his final year project in Imperial.
Yung Nam Cheah: Give us a brief
history of the app!
Krishnan Patel: I started the app
as my final year project and it was
something that I enjoyed a lot. I spent
more time than I should have on it
and continued working on it part-
time even after graduation. Before I
started working on Kites full time in
2014 though I also worked on anther
start-up project which unfortunately
didn’t work out.
YNC: Why did you start Kites?
KP: It might sound strange to some
people, but I am not a fan of trying
out new things in the real world
without ‘knowing’ that they are going
to be good. However, I am open to
checking out new places if they are
recommended to me by a friend.
One example would be this Italian
restaurant around the corner from
Imperial (Da Mario’s) that I never
knew existed until these guys from
my group projects took me there. At
first only my friends used it and we
send private messages to each other,
but then it gained traction and I
opened it to the public.
YNC: What was the idea behind it?
KP: The idea is to allow people to find
interesting things and learn new stuff
about their city, or discover trivia
that they would otherwise not known
in a city they visited. It’s the little
things like this is Princess Diana’s
favourite restaurant. I have lived in
London for 16 years and I love that
there are still so many new places to
discover.
I love twitter so I based the format
of Kites on it, with a word limit (140)
to keep the information concise.
People can follow each other and
favourite Kites and comment on it.
Recently I have added a collection
feature that can link Kites together to
form a mini tour and I plan to expand
on that!
YNC: Why is it call Kites?
KP: Originally when the app was still
private, you would not be able to
see the message until you are close
by, kind of like a kite. I am also a
fan of the letter K and the colour
green, that’s how the name and logo
came about. However I am open to
changing the logo in the future.
YNC: What are the weirdest Kites
you ever came across?
KP: There’s one in Taiwan which
marks out a suicide hotspot; in
London there’s this guy who marks
a bunch of kites around his house.
There’s also a lot of random messages
of people saying hi and it takes some
time to sort through them everyday.
YNC: Do you have any favourites?
KP: There is this guy who left a Kite
for where you can see the best view
of Seattle Monument which is a great
insider tip and I love it.
YNC: Where in the world has the
most Kites?
KP: For now London is taking the
lead, but Kites is spreading all over
the world and I am excited to see
more.
Kites is available on both Android
and Apple – why not check it out and
find out what’s around the corner
from you!
