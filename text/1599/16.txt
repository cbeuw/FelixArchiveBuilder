Don’t call me maybe
Sleeping with the wrong person
can have all sorts of bad
consequences. The best example
of this is what Dan Gallagher
(Michael Douglas) had to go through
for a one-night stand with cinema’s
most chilling woman scorned, Alex
Forrest (Glenn Close) aka the “bunny
boiler” in Fatal Attraction. Jennifer
Lopez’s new film, The Boy Next Door
essentially tells the same story, but
this time the gender roles have been
reversed. Jenny from the Block is
Claire, the recently separated high-
school English literature teacher who
eyes, plays with, and then tosses aside
her hunky new neighbour, Noah
(Ryan Guzman), who also happens to
be a student at her school.
They first meet when she struggles
to open her garage door. Enter Noah,
or more specifically, a close-up shot
of his toned arm, giving her support.
He befriends her, her son Kevin (Ian
Nelson), and a few days later, Claire
has her very own Carly Rae Jepsen’s
‘Call Me Maybe’ moment, staring
out her window seeing her eye candy
hard at work with gritty manual
labour. And good news for her is that
unlike the hit music video, Noah is
straight and is eyeing her back. It does
not take long for the two to spend a
steamy night together, and for Claire
to realise that she has in fact made a
mistake.
There is a fair amount of cringe-
worthy moments to be had in what
are supposed to be the sweet and
tender scenes of the two characters
initially falling for each other. It all
comes across as painfully awkward
that in the end you start wondering
where things will start going wrong
for the couple. The lingering stares,
all the uncomfortable touching,
and disjointed conversations all
contribute to unintentional hilarity,
with the prize-winning moment
going to the scene in which Noah
gives Claire the first edition of
Homer’s ‘The Iliad’, which basically
cannot actually exist in such an intact
form. Way to ruin a moment, writers.
But then the obsessive behaviour
begins. It turns violent and overtly
sexual, with Noah truly revealing his
colours as a complete psychopath
relentlessly stalking and harassing
Claire, both at her home and her
workplace. Kudos to Lopez who plays
the victim role well, but the film
struggles to find a convincing villain
in Noah with Guzman. He is helped
by the occasionally explicit nature of
his dialogue, (him facing off against
Claire’s best friend, the high-school’s
vice principle (Kristin Chenoweth),
is particularly amusing) but Guzman
himself cannot seem to come across
as a menacing figure. The scorned
man talks the talk and finds creative
new ways to torment the woman
who will not reciprocate his feelings,
including the threat of a secretly
filmed sex video, revenge porn
laws be damned. But threatening is
something he does not even come
close to achieving; not even a tenth
of how Glenn Close chilled an
entire generation with her volatile
villainess.
It all comes together to a ridiculous
climax surrounded by flames in
which our heroine fights for her dear
life, whilst trying to save her son,
as well as her estranged, cheating
husband. If there is ever an epi-pen
lying around to be used as a weapon,
it will be sure to use it in the most
effective way possible, as shown in
the film’s rather gratifying end. The
Boy Next Door delivers exactly what it
promises to do on the surface. It is a
trashy thriller, sometimes with little
logic involved, but in that there is
simple, laid-back fun to be had for the
film’s relatively short running time.
Along with some gratuitous nudity
and thrusting for anyone who wishes
to see it.

Congratulations are in order for
Eddie Redmayne and Julianne
Moore for their very deserving
Oscar wins last Sunday night. But did
you know that back in the day, when
Redmayne was starting out in the
film industry, and when Moore was
getting snubbed by the Academy on
multiple occasions, they the two of
them starred in a film together?
Released all the way back in 2008,
Moore plays Barbara Daly Baekeland,
a New York socialite who gets up to
no good with her schizophrenic son
Antony (Redmayne). And by “no
good”, we are talking about some
seriously twisted psychological issues
here.
Moore and Redmayne, as can
be expected, give committed
performances, and make the odd,
uncomfortable subject matter
somewhat bearable, and the film is no
short on delivering shocks. The film
is bold in venturing to explore the
chilling nature of their relationship,
and you begin to wonder just how this
sordid tale will end.
And yet the film rarely succeeds
in connecting all the dots. The plot
barely skims through the many years
shared between the two characters
in frantic time-jumps, and to call the
story a superficial glance would be
an understatement. This could have
worked as a TV mini-series. But as a
film? Barely scrapes the surface.
