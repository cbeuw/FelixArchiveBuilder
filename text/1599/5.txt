So you want to get a Tier 4 (General) Visa...
Just what hoops do our
international peers have to jump
through in order to obtain entry
clearance-after meeting their
offer conditions,that is?
Depending on your field of
study,and whether you’re a PG/UG
student on a course leading to a
PG qualification (MEng/MSci),you
may have to fill out an additional
application for an ATAS certificate
–and get that approved–before
even applying for your visa.This
takes approximately 20 working
days to process,so that’s at least
one month towards the process.
Whether UG or PG,all student
visa apps start with two forms: the
actual VAF9,required by every UK
visa applicant; and the Appendix 8
form,which only applies to Tier 4
applicants.The former collects the
applicant’s personal information
and travel history,and is usually
first filled out online.You also pay
the £310 application fee (+ £150/yr
NHS surcharge from Apr 2015) at
this time.
Appendix 8 is where you delve
into the nitty-gritty about your
course and institution,proof of
English language ability,and how
you’re funding your studies.That
“CAS number”you hear us waxing
lyrical about a lot? It comes into
play here: by looking up that
number,it’s easier for the Home
Office will be able to see if you’ve
already paid anything towards
tuition and/or accommodation,
plus any other important info.
That declaration isn’t enough,
as you then need a bunch of
original documents as proof.
It’s these that are finicky to
collate–these documents
include your pre-university (A2,
IB etc) and English language
proficiency (IELTS/TOEFL)
exam results,ATAS certificate
if needed,recent medical
certification proving you’re free
from tuberculosis (more money
for the exam there!) and–most
importantly–supporting financial
documentation.Minor oversights
by applicants in this part are a
major cause for visa refusal; if
English isn’t your country’s official
language,painstakingly-certified
translations cost time and money.
Financially sponsored students
need detailed affidavits,which
will take time to obtain depending
on your sponsor’s efficiency.
As for self-sponsored students,
they have to prepare detailed
bank statements,along with a
signed letter from a bank official
proving that the amount of money
needed has been present in said
account for at least 28 consecutive
days.Further documentation is
needed to prove the student has
permission to access these funds.
Applicants from countries
considered low-risk do not
necessarily have to submit all the
financial proof needed,which
in essence should speed things
up; however,as the Home Office
reserves the right to request
for these at random,you’re
often required to collate those
documents anyway.
After all that,you have to make
an appointment with the relevant
visa office in their country to
hand these (and your passport) in
person.As you’re not allowed to
apply more than 3 months before
your course start date,visa offices
get stretched to beyond capacity
between June and September (one
could consider it early training in
British queuing culture!)...which
means even with appointments,
queues often last a few hours.
After submission,you have to
wait for at least 3 weeks (in peak
season) until you’re contacted
with the news that your app has
been processed.You then have
to return to pick up your passport
and check if you’ve been approved
or not.If you’ve somehow
been rejected,appeals and re-
submissions will cost you more
time (and potentially money) to
process.
The red tape and costs don’t just
stop there.Certain students have
to register with the police and
pay £34 pounds within 7 days of
arrival,and let’s not forget other
costs of setting up your new life
abroad: long-haul flights,clothes,
kitchen equipment...that’s just the
tip of the iceberg!

In an email sent out earlier this
month to undergraduate students
expecting to graduate this year,
the College announced a change
from usual procedures for the annual
ceremony.
The graduation day, known
as Commemoration Day to
commemorate the visit of Queen
Victoria to the Royal College of
Chemistry in 1845, is usually held on
a Wednesday in October.
However, this year the ceremony
will take place on Monday 19th.
In its email, the College described
the change as necessary in order to
“enable all graduating students to
attend”. It goes on to say, “A fifth of
graduating students have visas with
an expiry date in advance of the date
previously considered.”
A separate email sent out to all
College staff advised lecturers that
mitigation would be put in place to
cater for the disruption to teaching,
since more classes take place on a
Monday than a Wednesday, as all
students have Wednesday afternoons
off for sports practices.
Whilst students usually have a free
day during Commemoration Day,
likely as staff are busy taking part
in the ceremonies or in the various
receptions for graduating students,
some students last year still had some
academic commitments during the
day.

Despite complaints from many
quarters, the Government
will be implementing its
previously announced plans to
charge non-EU nationals (including
students) for access to NHS services.
The proposals were initially
announced as part of the
Immigration Bill in October 2013.
Imperial College Union last year
passed a paper officially opposing this
proposal in the Immigration Bill. The
paper, as voted on by Council, also
instructed the Union to lobby College
to “ensure measures are in place to
mitigate the effect of this Bill”.
Starting in April, foreign nationals
applying for, or extending, a visa
for longer than 6 months will be
required to pay a surcharge of £200
for NHS access, on top of existing visa
charges. However a discount of £50
is available to students, and access is
also included for dependents of visa
applicants.
In addition to the surcharge, the
Government has also instructed
NHS trusts to reclaim up to 150%
of the cost of a hospital procedure
from patients outside the EU, with
NHS trusts liable for a fine if they do
not take measures to retrieve these
charges from patients.
EU nationals will also be charged
125% of the cost of NHS hospital
procedures, although patients will
not be liable for these charges as
such treatment is covered under
the European healthcare insurance
scheme, using an EHIC (European
Health Insurance Card).
However, under this new policy,
GP appointments will remain free of
charge.
Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has
introduced these premiums over the
normal cost of the hospital procedure
in order to incentivise NHS trusts
to recoup the money. In a speech at
a lunch last year, Hunt said, “I have
no problem [...] with foreigners using
our NHS, as long as they contribute
to it either through taxes or through
paying charges. We need to be much
better at collecting that revenue.”
British Medical Association Council
chairman, Dr. Mark Porter, said on
the policy: "Anyone accessing NHS
services should be eligible to do so but
a doctor's duty is to treat the patient
that's in front on them, not to act as
border guard.”
