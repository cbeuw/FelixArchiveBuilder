Sir Malcolm Rifkind has
resigned as Chairman of the
parliamentary Intelligence
and Security Committee and will
step down as Kensington’s MP at
the upcoming election. Sir Rifkind
had hoped to continue as MP for
Kensington, which is one of the most
desirable Tory seats in the UK, but
resigned after becoming embroiled in
fresh “cash-for-access” allegations.
Rifkind, a former Conservative
foreign secretary, has denied any
wrong doing with regards to the
Dispatches investigation responsible
for his resignation, where he was
secretly filmed offering to sell his
political contacts and influence to a
Chinese firm in return for thousands
of pounds at a daily rate. The fake
Hong Kong based company, created
by Dispatches and Daily Telegraph
reporters, claimed to be seeking
people with business and political
experience to become members on
the company’s advisory board.
In the undercover footage Rifkind
remarked, “You’d be surprised how
much free time I have. I spend a lot
of time reading, I spend a lot of time
walking. Because I’m not a minister
or full-time working for one person.
I can sort out my day. I am self-
employed so nobody pays my salary. I
have to earn my income but when I’m
not doing something I can do what I
like.” Rifkind is not self-employed,
due to his £67k salary as a member of
parliament for Kensington.
Dipatches also met with former
Labour minister and foreign secretary
Jack Straw with a similar offer. In
the meeting, Straw, who is standing
down at the upcoming election, said
“The best way of dealing with these
things is under the radar.” In the
undercover investigation he was
filmed asking what the organisation
would want from him and what the
time commitments would be, before
explaining that “Normally, if I’m
doing a speech or something it’s
£5000 a day, that’s what I charge.”
In a subsequent BBC news
interview, Mr Straw remarked that
“This was a very sophisticated, skilful
deceit and like Malcolm Rifkind I fell
into it.”
In Sir Malcolm Rifkind’s Today
interview, the MP said the claims
are “unfounded and I am going to
fight them with all my strength.” He
declared that “I’ve got nothing to be
embarrassed about. Every single thing
I said to these people, I would have
been willing to say on television or to
you if you’d put the same questions to
me at the time.” The senior politician
went on to contend that it is perfectly
acceptable for MPs to have outside
interests.
Rifkind argued that it is unrealistic
for MPs to live on £67k, because “the
vast majority of people of a business
or professional background earn far,
far more than that”, going onto say
that if prospective MP candidates
cannot earn money on the side
through ‘second jobs’ then “they just
won’t come to the House of Commons
at all, and parliament will lose their
skills.”
It is believed that hundreds of
MPs and peers have taken on similar
agreements to those offered by Sir
Malcolm and Mr Straw, and the
concept of politicians being for hire
was discussed in this week’s Prime
Minister’s Question Time. There are
calls to reform the parliamentary
regulations that currently allow MPs
to make multiple times what they
earn as MPs so long as it is reported
in the register for member’s interests,
which is public information. This
fresh ‘cash for access’ touches on
the wider issues of transparency in
Westminster, the buying of political
influence from private firms and MP
salaries.
Sir Malcolm had represented the
Kensington constituency since 2005
and had already been suspended as
a member of the Conservative party
before his resignation. He has held
various high positions and cabinet
positions under the Prime Ministers
Margaret Thatcher and John Major,
including Secretary of State for
Scotland, Defence Secretary and
Foreign Secretary. Malcolm Rikfind
is a member of the Queen’s Privy
Counsel and received a knighthood
in John Major’s resignation honours,
becoming a Knight Commander of
the Order of St Michael and St George
(KCMG). This is an honour appointed
on individuals in recognition of their
important services to Commonwealth
or foreign nations. Throughout this
time he was the MP for Edinburgh
Pentlands, a position he held from
1974 to 1997. He took a break from
politics until his return to parliament
in 2005. After the Conservative
defeat that took place in that year’s
general election Sir Malcolm was a
potential contender for leader of the
party.
In a statement Sir Malcolm
explained that, “I had intended to
seek one further term as MP for
Kensington, before retiring from the
House of Commons. I have concluded
that to end the uncertainty it would
be preferable, instead, to step down at
the end of this parliament.”
“This is entirely my personal
decision. I have had no such requests
from my constituency association but
I believe that it is the right and proper
action to take.”
“As regards the allegations of
Channel 4 and the Daily Telegraph I
find them contemptible and will not
comment further at this time.”
In a separate statement made
Tory MP for Kensington will step
down at election
Sir Malcolm Rifkind also resigns immediately as Chairman of the
Intelligence and Security Committee. Joshua Renken reports on the latest
scandal to erupt from Westminster. Rifkind speaks to Policy Exchange in
about his resignation as Chairman
of the Security and Intelligence
Committee, Rifkind said, “None of
the current controversy with which I
am associated is relevant to my work
as chairman of the intelligence and
security committee of parliament.
However, I have today informed my
colleagues that while I will remain a
member of the committee, I will step
down from the chairmanship.”
Together with former Labour
foreign secretary Jack Straw, Sir
Malcolm has referred himself to
Parliament’s standards watchdog and
denies breaching House of Commons
rules. Many MPs earn considerable
amounts of money through their
‘second jobs’.
A spokesman for the Conservative
Party said: “Sir Malcolm has had a
long career of distinguished service
both to the Conservative Party and
the country. We respect and support
his decision to stand down.”
