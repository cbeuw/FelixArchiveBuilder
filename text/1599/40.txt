IC Athletics looks at a weekend with hard fought running... and mascots
"A late
burst from
Casper
saw him
overtake
Liverpool's
Lenny the
Liverbird"
"We
managed
to all reach
London to
keep on
laughing at
videos of
the... race"
Once again, Imperial College
Athletics and XC club
travelled to Sheffield for
the annual BUCS Indoor Champs.
No-one quite expected the usually
tame competition to turn quite so
hilarious...
The weekend got under way early
on Friday with a mix of youth and
experience as 5th year Chris Chung
and fresher Sydney Chan both ran
7.67s in the 60m heats unfortunately
both missed out on the semis.
The bulk of the action took place
on Saturday. First up on the track was
fresher Alex Mundell swapping the
mud and rain of cross country for the
fast dry track. A strong performance
saw her finish third in the strongest
of the three heats bagging a fastest
loser spot in the final on Sunday.
Next up was the mens’ 400m with
two Imperial athletes taking part.
Luke Butler narrowly missed out on
a semi-finals spot before the captain
Gareth Holden set a new PB of 52.29s
on his way to qualifying for the semi-
finals on Sunday morning.
While all this was happening on
the track Emma Watkins was putting
in a solid performance in the long
jump and Erik Tropp was again
entertaining in the pole vault after
an adventure getting his 14ft pole
around Sheffield (many thanks to
Judo for offering their minibus).
Unable to recreate his amazing
SESSA form he still impressed with
a leap of 3.60m. And last but by no
means least in the field Shivam Patel
mixed it with the big boys at the shot
putt.
Then came the main event, the
one we had all been waiting for:
the mascot race. Imperial had two
entries: the majestic Albert the Lion
and the homemade and much loved
Casper the Casio Calculator each
contributing £25 to Marie Curie
Cancer Care. Albert started with a
stumble and never really recovered
but a late burst from Casper saw
him overtake Liverpool’s Lenny the
Liverbird in the home straight to
finish 10th in what was by far the
most hilariously entertaining race of
the weekend.
The afternoon saw the 4x200m
team of Gareth Holden, Sidney Chan,
Edrea Pan and James Roughneen take
to the track. Despite some impressive
running (albeit with an unnecessary
detour via lane 6) the team was
disqualified for a mystery changeover
infringement.
The tiring and impressive results
from the day meant only three were
left standing for the “big night out”
who found out that Northern clubs
are decades behind London not only
with their prices but their music
choices too.
The next morning it was the turn of
the 200m runners with Ines Kübler
getting the team under way closely
followed by James Roughneen and
Edrea Pan all three of whom put in
strong performances but were unable
to make the semis.
Sunday afternoon brought the
weekend’s elite performances.
Putting in a true captain’s
performance Gareth Holden ran a
blisteringly quick 51.68s to smash
his PB yet again, taking more than
a second off his pre-BUCS time.
Unfortunately it was not enough to
progress in what was an outrageously
strong 400m field but he can
certainly be proud of his last indoor
performance for the team and his
time as Imperial athletic captain as a
whole.
Finally came the other big race
of the weekend: ICSM fresher Alex
Mundell in the final of the 1500m.
The race got off to a very slow start
with no one looking like they wanted
to take it out, but at the half way
point the favourite turned up the
heat, slashing the lap times to string
out the field.
Alex reacted well giving it her all
and was chasing down third when
she hit the wall in the final lap to slip
back to eighth but still pick up the all
important final BUCS point.
We hope she continues to shine in
athletics during her next five years at
Imperial.
Despite numerous cancelled trains
and frantic train swapping under
the command of our own public
transport expert and calculator-
costumed athlete, we managed to all
reach London to keep on laughing at
videos of the mascot race over and
over and over again.
