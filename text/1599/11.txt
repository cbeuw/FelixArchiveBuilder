"The research
could be
used in
future dental
restorations."
Engineers believe they may
have found the strongest
natural material on Earth –
limpet teeth. Research conducted
at the University of Portsmouth has
revealed that the teeth of these small
aquatic creatures are so strong they
could be copied to make the cars,
planes and boats of the future.
A team of researchers at the
University’s School of Engineering
discovered that limpet teeth contain
Goethite, a hard mineral made up of
fibrous structures. Together these
fibres create a material that rivals the
strength of even the toughest man-
made fibres. Limpets rely on their
high strength teeth for scraping rock
surfaces to collect algae to feed on.
Designing materials based on
what we see in nature is known
as ‘bioinspiration’. Until now,
spider silk was thought to be the
strongest biological material, with
a variety of potential applications
from bulletproof vests to computer
electronics.
Professor Asa Barber, who led the
research, said: “Nature is a wonderful
source of inspiration for structures
that have excellent mechanical
properties. All the things we observe
around us, such as trees, the shells
of sea creatures and the limpet teeth
studied in this work, have evolved to
be effective at what they do.”
Replications of limpet teeth
may be used in the future for high
performance engineering of Formula
1 cars, boat hulls and aircraft
structures.
“Engineers are always interested
in making these structures stronger
to improve their performance or
lighter so they use less material…but
with so many biological structures to
consider, it can take time to discover
which may be useful.”
Barber’s team tested a piece of
limpet tooth almost 100 times
thinner than the diameter of a
human hair. A technique called
atomic force microscopy was used to
pull apart the material down to the
level of the atom and examine its
mechanical behaviour.
The research also revealed that
limpet teeth are just as strong no
matter what their size.
“Generally a bigger structure has
lots of flaws and can break more
easily than a smaller structure, which
has fewer flaws and is stronger. The
problem is that most structures have
to be fairly big so they’re weaker than
we would like. Limpet teeth break
this rule as their strength is the same
Anyone who’s ever been to
a primary school music
recital may well have got
the impression that the recorder is a
rather simple instrument.
The physics behind it, however, is
incredibly complicated.
Using a powerful supercomputer
running for two weeks, a group led by
Hiroshi Yokoyama from Toyohashi
University of Technology in Japan
have determined the complex nature
of the sound field around a recorder
and other air reed instruments for the
very first time.
When the musician bows into an air
reed instrument, standing waves are
created within the tube, causing it to
resonate.
Covering and uncovering
holes changes the wavelengths
the instrument will resonate at,
producing different pitched notes.
A recorder contains a small slit just
below the mouthpiece called the knife
edge, which splits the airflow going in
and out of the recorder.
This creates highly nonlinear
effects, forming turbulent vortices,
which are extremely chaotic, and
require huge computing power to
model accurately.
Using computational fluid
dynamics techniques, the team
determined how this behaviour
creates pressure waves that emanate
from the instrument.
Importantly, they also predicted
how the sound propagates through
the air, forming a far-field pattern
that is heard by the audience.
The work was presented at an
annual conference on noise control
engineering in Melbourne, Australia.
The research was done in
collaboration with instrument
makers Yamaha, who hope this new
understanding could help them to
design instruments with a better
sound quality. Sound waves propagating from a recorder. Photo: Hiroshi Yokoyama

no matter what the size.”
The findings of the study, published
in the Royal Society journal Interface,
even have the potential to be used
for future dental restorations. The
next challenge for researchers is to
work out how limpet teeth can be
replicated in the lab to allow the
material to be used in engineering.
