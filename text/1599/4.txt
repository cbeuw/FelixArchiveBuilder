With anger and uncertainty over the
Government’s immigration policy,
Philip Kent finds out what’s going on.
What’s going on with
student visas?
An influential group of MPs has
criticised the Government’s
student visa policy this week.
In a report published by the All-Party
Parliamentary Group on Migration,
the MPs argued for re-opening of the
“post-study work route” following
graduation.
Up until 2012, international
students could remain in the UK
for up to two years while searching
for another educational course (for
example, a Masters) or employment.
Following the change, students
have only four months, meaning an
Imperial undergraduate whose course
ends in late June may remain in the
UK until late October.
The group of MPs argued for this
period to be extended to twelve
months, in order to “[maximise] the
attractiveness of UK higher education
in the face of an increasingly
competitive international
marketplace”.
A decrease in the number of
international students was felt to be
due to this change in how student
visas work, dropping by near 5,000
between the years 11-12 and 12-13,
although the numbers are now again
on the increase. There are currently in
the region of 300,000 students from
outside the EU in UK universities.
Former vice-chancellor at the
University of East Anglia, Prof.
Edward Acton, said that the Home
Office’s policies have “butchered”
relationships with India. Statistics
from the Higher Education Statistics
Agency found a 25% reduction in the
number of Indian students during the
year 2012-13.
Imperial College Union’s
International Officer, Katherine
Chio, supported the proposal by the
parliamentary group, telling Felix,
“By extending the visa expiry date
from four months after graduation to
one year, this could attract the most
qualified international students to
further study and work in the UK
after graduation, hence contributing
to the UK’s job market and economy.”
The current government has a
policy to reduce the number of net
migrants into the UK below 100,000,
thus motivating changes to the visa
system. A motion was raised in the
House of Commons by Labour MP
Paul Blomfield, with backing by
Conservative MP Mark Field, and Lib
Dem MP Sir Andrew Stunell, calling
for students to be exempted from
such a cap.
Mr. Blomfield said, “Five
parliamentary select committees
have urged the government to stop
attacking students in its immigration
policy and handing the advantage to
our international competitors”.
This motion was backed by
Universities UK, the umbrella
group for UK higher education
organisations, and the Institute of
Directors. The University of Sheffield
has also publicly supported the early
day motion on its website. This
motion is yet to be voted on by the
House of Commons.
Meanwhile, a group of business
leaders including Baroness Lane-Fox
(CEO of Lastminute.com) and Simon
Collins (UK Chairman of professional
services firm KPMG) have written
a letter to the Financial Times,
similarly calling on students to be
removed from immigration quotas.
In this letter, the businessmen
and women say, “We do not want
to lose these talented people to our
competitor economies as a result
of ill-thought-out immigration
policies.” The letter also notes a poll
by ICM for Universities UK and
think-tank British Future, which
found that 75% of respondents think
that international students should
be able to stay and work in the UK
following the completion of their
studies.
Meanwhile, near 60% of
respondents think that international
student numbers should not be
cut, and around 80% think that
international students do not count
as immigrants at all.
The rhetoric against foreign
students has worsened over the past
few years. In 2013, the Government
announced proposals to charge non-
EU migrants a ‘surcharge’ upon entry
to access the NHS, including students.
The charge, to be £150 for students,
will be brought into effect later this
year (see box).
Meanwhile, last year Home
Secretary Theresa May announced
plans to completely ban international
students from remaining in the UK
immediately following completion
of their studies, unless the student
has work lined up. This proposal was
raised because of fears of abuse of the
current system, whilst international
student numbers were expected to
increase to around 600,000 by 2020.
The proposal has been criticised by
the Labour Party, university bosses,
as well as business leaders including
Sir James Dyson who warns of “dire
consequences for businesses”.
May said there are no limits on
the number of students who can
come to the UK to study in a genuine
academic institution, and would not
change the policy for welcoming the
“brightest and the best” into the UK.
She indicated that the policy would
appear in the Conservative Party’s
manifesto for this May’s election.
However, shortly afterwards
Chancellor of the Exchequer George
Osborne was reported to have killed
off Ms. May’s policy, according to
the Financial Times. A Government
source told the FT that it remains
policy to allow any foreign student in
a graduate-level job leave to remain
"The Home
Office’s
policies have
“butchered”
relationships
with India."
"We do not
want to
lose these
talented
people to our
competitor
economies as
a result of ill-
thought-out
immigration
policies."
Are
internati
students
under
threat?
in the UK.
Former Universities minister,
David Willets, told Radio 4 that
May’s proposal was never party
policy, saying about the plan: “I don’t
think it was a good idea”.
Overall, Business Secretary Vince
Cable (Liberal Democrat) has warned
that the public debate regarding
immigration may damage the
“economically valuable” recruitment
of international students.
Whilst the exact policy on student
visas is yet to be clarified, and will
depend quite significantly on what
Government is formed following
this May’s General Election, people
still have concern over the rhetoric
concerning international student
visas.
Chio was concerned that the UK’s
policies may affect Imperial’s global
reputation. She told Felix, “Imperial
is privileged to have the brightest
students from all over the world to
study here, in which the International
students make up 1/3 of Imperial’s
student population. As the policies
on student visas will discourage
international students from studying
in the UK and hence in Imperial,
it may affect Imperial’s global
reputation.”
