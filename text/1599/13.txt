“Worst party leader interview ever”
Tories and Labour ridiculed and
condemned before the election but
we’ve actually been able to do this. We
really emphasised the environment
by introducing for example the green
investment bank. We’ve provided
also a huge break on numerous
Conservative policies. The most
extreme are things like abolishing
basically all employment rights,
allowing companies to fire people at
will. Basically totally privatising the
NHS. So really it’s pretty remarkable
what we’ve prevented the Tories from
doing and also what we’ve managed
to achieve given that we have a fifth
as many MPs as the Tories and no
governing experience before the
coalition.
Generally speaking when people
discover how much we’ve achieved
they are willing to give us a lot of
credit. We’ve done this in the face
of an almost unanimously hostile
media, a very hostile Labour Party
and generally in bad circumstances.
There are however a couple of things
were we haven’t been successful.
JR: How can students trust your
party again after the broken
promise on university tuition fees?
RMG: First of all many Lib Dem MPs
abstained and secondly the change in
tuition fees is not actually the kind of
atrocity that it was depicted as.
Let’s look at what the other two
parties were saying; The Tories
wanted to take the cap off tuition fees.
Basically privatise the whole thing.
If you look at what Labour actually
said before the election, they said
at minimum they would want to be
having at minimum a much, much
larger cap than £9000. Lib Dems
changed the amount you have to earn
before you pay it back so that it’s not
very much at all. I know this because
I’ve done it. So frankly the deal that
we actually got was really very good.
But most MPs were going after even
more generous loans. And like I said
we’ve introduced postgraduate loans
in the most recent budget.
Labour had the opportunity for
thirteen years and they didn’t even
care. The Tories certainly don’t care.
This is very much what we’re doing so
I think our record on student issues
has been pretty positive.
And by the way I certainly wouldn’t
have voted for the change in tuition
fees because I think that higher
education should be free.
JR: Why do you think the Lib
Dems are doing so poorly in the
opinion polls?
RMG: Very simple. The simple fact
of being in government. It literally
doesn’t matter who with. That is
easily enough to lose us a huge chunk
of our support.
Basically a lot of people voted for
before the coalition us just because
we were the default opposition party.
And I think the simple fact of losing
that is responsible of two thirds of the
support that we’ve lost at least. I mean
I’m not denying we’ve made mistakes,
or that the party leadership has made
mistakes. But I mean, come on. We
were considered a protest party. And
we don’t want to be.
JR: What do you think of our
position in the EU?
RMG: The Lib Dems ran very strong
pro-EU campaign in the European
elections and we were the only party
to do so at all. And I’m very pleased
with that because the EU is basically
a very good thing. It gives us vast
influence across the world, which
we otherwise wouldn’t have, and it
allows favourable trading systems to
be developed. My problem with the
Lib Dem election campaign was that
we didn’t talk about reforming the
EU because it is deeply undemocratic.
It’s not that there’s no democracy
there but we should be electing the
commission as well as parliament.
Really I would say the EU is a good
thing but we need to reform it.
JR: And our immigration policy?
RMG: On immigration, I want to
change the system so that we are
thinking about who is coming in not
what country they are from. And that
means that Imperial students can
come in easily.
JR: If you could scrap any law or
policy which one would you go for?
RMG: I would just say we’re not going
to support countries such as Saudi
Arabia, which is a flat out theocratic
terror state that kills its own people.
If we scrapped these sorts of foreign
alliances I think this would send a
strong sort of message to the world.
JR: Do you think age matters
when you become a member of
parliament?
RMG: I think it’s important to
have as broad a range as possible in
parliament.
That also means having more old
people in parliament.
JR: Favourite columnist?
RMG: Peter Oborne.
JR: Favourite newspaper?
RMG: The Guardian.
JR: What was the last work of
fiction you read?
RMG: ‘The Gun Seller’ by Hugh
Laurie
JR: Favourite Book?
RMG: Probably ‘The Road To Wigan
Pier’ by George Orwell
JR: Are you religious?
RMG: No. Complete atheist.
JR: House of Cards or West Wing?
RMG: House of Cards
JR: Favourite current Lib Dem MP?
RMG: Julian Huppert
JR: Favourite MP who isn’t a Lib
Dem?
RMG: William Hague
JR: In the latest QS world
university rankings Imperial
College was joint second with
Cambridge, while Oxford was
a frankly abysmal fifth place.
That said, do you prefer the term
‘Impbridge’ or ‘Camperial’?
RMG: Good question. I think
‘Camperial’ sounds better.
The leader of the Green Party
Natalie Bennett has apologised
to party members after an
“excruciating” radio interview on
LBC concerning one of its policies on
housing.
In part of the Greens’ election
campaign launch, Ms Bennett failed
to explain how the party would be
able to fund their pledge to create half
a million new council homes.
She told Nick Ferrari that the
policy would cost just £2.7 billion,
which prompted the LBC presenter to
ask:“Five hundred thousand homes
– £2.7bn? What are they made of –
plywood?”. Ms Bennett insisted the
policy was “fully costed” but struggled
to explain where the money would
come from or provide the figures to
back up her claims.
Natalie Bennett, who was elected
to her position as the leader of the
Green Party of England and Wales in
September 2012, could not respond to
Nick Ferrari’s questions surrounding
the costs of the policy.
The party, which currently has
one MP in the House of Commons
(Caroline Lucas), has several striking
policies including the introduction of
a “citizen’s income” of £72 a week for
all adults.
The Green Party has enjoyed a
membership surge to 55,000 in recent
months (more than the Lib Dems
or Ukip) and is currently polling on
around 8% of the vote. The success of
this left wing party has been much to
The “excruciating” interview with Green Party Leader Natalie Bennett
the detriment of Labour’s chances of
winning a majority at the upcoming
general election.
Labour has publicly questioned
Ms Bennett’s grasp of policy but in
response to the recent criticism over
her poor interview she explained
“I’m very sorry to Green Party
members that I didn’t do a good job
at representing our policies. That
happens, I’m human. One can have a
mental brain fade on these things.”
In a subsequent Sky News interview,
the leader of the Greens said: “I’ve
spent the last two and a half years
talking about our policies and the
answer is to face up to one’s mistakes
and move on.”
Perhaps Natalie, next time just
go for “I’m sorry I don’t have the
figures?”
"The
change in
tuition
fees is not
actually
the kind
of atrocity
that it was
depicted
as."
"Really I
would say
the EU
is a good
thing but
we need to
reform it."
