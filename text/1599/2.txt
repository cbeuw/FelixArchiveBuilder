going to happen).
These are the roles that represent
students to College, and although
whether College actually listens is
another story altogether, these are
still the only people that give us
the best chance of getting our point
across to the big kids in the Blue
Cube.
With lots of stories this year
highlighting how infrequently
College listens to us, consider
choosing a candidate that may
finally get our point across. We need
student representatives that are
happy to go into meetings and not
pussyfoot around all the jargon and
buzzwords that college staff has a
tendency to throw about. We need
student representatives that know
enough about the systems in place to
then challenge them, and make sure
there is change. We also need student
representatives that understand what
issues affect students, and how they

What’s on this
week:
Nominations close for
the Big Elections
Feb 29th, 23:59, Online
Do you like student politics,
hack talk, complaining
over policies and stalking
Chris Kaye? Run in the
BIG ELECTIONS, and join
the trend that is sweeping
campus: running for
pointless roles to simply
make your CV look great.
IT’S FREE TO DO TOO!
This week we’ve gone all
political; we’ve covered the
resignation of the Kensington
MP over the “cash for access” scandal,
the government tug of war over
international students and their right
to stay in the UK after graduation,
and we’ve thrown in an interview
with Liberal Democrat MP Robin
McGhee for good measure.
This is very apt considering that
student elections are due to kick off
on Monday too. Student politics will
be very much back on the agenda
next week as the campus is covered in
posters, the JCR is littered with fliers
and free sweets are everywhere in
between.
There will be badly made t-shirts,
there will be buzzword filled
manifestos and let’s hope there will be
at least one candidate that thinks it’s
a good idea to storm across campus
with a megaphone.
These students will be running
for full-time and part-time roles,
including those that make up the
Imperial College Union sabbatical
team (Can we stop trying to make
Officer Trustee happen, it’s never
should be addressed.
Although to be fair, as long as our
sabbaticals don’t take cash in hand to
bring papers to Union Council, they
are still doing better than the adults
that represent us in government.
Saying that, the role of Felix Editor
is also up for grabs too. Do you
think you could improve this stellar
publication? Do you like challenging
College, the Union and the rugby
boys over their email content? Can
you read and write? You might be the
perfect candidate for next year’s Felix
Editor.
Nominations close on Sunday
evening, so if you want to get stuck
in, you’ve only got two more days
to decide. If you’ve got pissed at
any of the stories we’ve ran this
year, whether it was the closure of
Weeks, the amenities fund cuts,
medic money struggles or smashed
coach windows, get involved with
the Union, have your say and make a
difference.
Alternatively, if you get involved
and still nothing changes, at least you
have a legitimate excuse to then bitch
about it all.
In last week’s issue, an
article, entitled “Why
did no-one tell us College
wants to shut our halls?” we
stated that Tom Wheeler,
Imperial College Union
President, knew about the
hall closure in October,
and cited minutes of the
Community and Welfare
Board, available online on
the Imperial Union website,
as evidence of this. However,
the minutes actually
stated that questions were
being raised as to what is
happening to the hall, and
did not explicitly state they
were closing. We would
like to offer apologies to
Wheeler for this inaccuracy.
