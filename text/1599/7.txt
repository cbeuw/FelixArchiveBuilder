Two Imperial College Television
(ICTV) reporters managed to
sneak past security and get
backstage at the BRIT awards on
Wednesday, and even managed to
interview some celebrities before
leaving undetected.
The two students turned up at
the star-studded event based at the
O2 arena brandishing poorly made
press passes, and were able to pass by
security and enter the backstage area.
A video made of the evening by the
students shows two different security
guards direct them towards the press
entrance. Later, one of the reporters
remarks how “Five Security guards
just walked past us, and said nothing!”
After bypassing security, they
ran into Lionel Richie, who they
then proceeded to interview about
how relevant the Brit Awards are.
“Relevance is what it is all about!”
he told the students, before escorted
away to his seat within the arena.
The students then loitered around
for around 30 minutes, and ran into
numerous celebrities as they were
shepherded into their seats. Those

"The two
students
also
managed
to snag an
impromptu
interview
with
Damon
Albarn."
they encountered included two
members of the Spice Girls, members
of the pop group Little Mix, comedian
Jimmy Carr, female musician St.
Vincent and Caroline Flack, the
esteemed presenter of hit TV Show
the Xtra Factor.
The pair approached Jade Thirlwall,
one of the members of the girl group
Little Mix, and asked Jade if they
thought another X-Factor contestant
could win an award.
Jade, looking confused, was
unable to answer, but the woman
accompanying her didn’t mince her
words, telling the students: “Fuck off
we don’t want to talk about X Factor.”
Jade then remarked about how it was
a bit of a “shitty question.”
The two students also managed to
snag an impromptu interview with
Damon Albarn, 46, the frontman of
the bands Blur and the Gorillaz, who
was also nominated for the British
Male Solo artist award.
When asked whether he stood a
good chance of winning he replied
sadly: “I’m in a category where
everyone else nominated is twenty-
five years younger than me, so I don’t
stand a chance in hell.”
“I’m here so my teenage daughter
and her friend can meet Taylor
Swift.”
They also asked him if he had any
favourites to win, to which he replied
“Nah, not really.” He then sadly slunk
away to take his place in the audience.
He later lost the award to Ed
Sheeran, aged 24.
One of the intrepid reporters told
Felix: “We actually saw a lot more
famous people, but we literally had no
idea who they all were.”
“I guess there are worst ways to
spend a Wednesday evening.”
The pair hung around backstage
for a further two hours, interviewing
random bystanders as the show took
place, before leaving and telling the
security “Good job lads!”
They then grabbed a cheeky
Wagamamas before heading home.
Said one of the reporters: “All in all, a
fantastic night out!”
The BRIT awards are held annually,
and celebrate the previous year’s
achievements in pop music.
