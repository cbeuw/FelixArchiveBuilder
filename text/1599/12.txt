Joshua Renken interviews the Liberal Democrat
parliamentary candidate for Kensington
An interview with Robin McGhee
At 23 years old, Robin McGhee
has already been involved
with the Liberal Democrats
for over a decade. While reading
History at Oxford University, Robin
affirmed his interest in politics and
stood for a local council seat. Since
graduating, he has been involved
in television, journalism, research,
and has worked for Lib Dem MPs.
In November of last year Robin
was selected to be the Liberal
Democrat parliamentary candidate
for Kensington. I spoke with him to
discuss constituency matters and
national politics.
Joshua Renken: What was it that
inspired you to get into politics?
Robin McGhee: It’s just the best way
possible of actually helping people
and achieving anything, and it’s
incredibly interesting. I’ve never
encountered a person who doesn’t
have some kind of interest in politics,
because politics is everything. Politics
encompasses all aspects of... well not
to sound pretentious, but human
behaviour. So I just don’t understand
how people couldn’t be interested in
it. It’s fascinating and the best way of
changing people’s lives, often for the
better, often for the worse.
JR: What do you think you would
bring to Kensington, if elected as
MP?
RMG: The first thing I’d bring is I’d
be the youngest MP elected, because
I’m 23. I would bring someone who is
genuinely interested in everyone in
the borough, unlike the current Tory
incumbent who is only interested in
the hyper wealthy.
I would be someone who is
interested in solving the housing
crisis that we currently have in the
capital, especially in Kensington.
Somebody who is interested in
looking seriously, nationally at how
we can change the way our democracy
works to bring about proper political
reform. Somebody who’s going
to stand up for all residents of
Kensington. You know Kensington
has lots of very poor areas and lots of
very rich areas.
I would be somebody who’s
genuinely interested in social
mobility and creating a more equal
society. And somebody also who
is willing to speak their mind. I
would want to be a very strong,
independently minded backbench
MP who is entirely interested in
getting stuff done. And getting stuff
done in an imaginative way, not in a
boring way of going along with what
the system likes, which is what I think
too many MPs like.
JR: What are the key issues you
feel need to be addressed in the
local area, and what could you
do better than the current Tory
incumbent Malcolm Rifkind MP?
RMG: Pretty much anything because
Rifkind is completely hopeless.
In Kensington I think the really
important issues are basically
housing, and the closely related
issue of small businesses; which
sound kind of boring, but actually
small businesses rely entirely on an
effective community. In Kensington
at the moment we have a very
worrying situation where large parts
of the borough are bought by foreign
property investors, and abandoned
and nobody actually goes there.
So it’s a terrible buy-to-leave
situation. This is ignoring the
extraordinary disaster of extreme
property price increases. So that’s
obviously a very big issue.
Education is also extremely
important because the borough’s
schools are very divided. You have
a huge number of extremely elite
schools, you know... good, but you also
have a very large number of schools
with overwhelmingly working class
and ethnic minority students which is
not good because it indicates a social
and indeed cultural divide. Which
is obviously a very bad thing. So it
would be quite useful if we could not
have that.
JR: How would you go about
solving the housing problem?
RMG: Well the problem is so giant
that no single MP could solve it.
But one thing that I’d want to do in
particular is work as an MP for the
rights of the people who have possibly
been subject to bad landlords which
we have a lot of, unfortunately, in the
borough. And also be an active voice
for introducing some kind of sanity
in the housing market. For example
abolishing buy to leave property
laws altogether which is extremely
damaging to literally everybody in
the entire country. Also working
to introduce some sort of national
discussion and organisation for
serious analysis for what the property
market is actually doing to our entire
society.
We need to think about the next
generation, which you and I are
part of. We need to think about
what this is going to do to our
society. I’m pretty concerned that
we are currently moving to a feudal
situation where basically people are
going to have to inherit property
from their parents like it’s the 13th
century or something, in order to
own property outright. But I’d like
to emphasise that in Kensington
and Chelsea specifically, I’m more
concerned about buy to leave
because that is a totally extreme
manifestation of investing in
property. So I think it’s important to
emphasis that I’d want to tackle that
as an MP rather than move onto the
enormous, all-consuming question
of what we are going to do about the
housing crisis. I’d want to concentrate
on what I can do in the borough
specifically.
JR: What could you do for
Imperial students who live in the
Kensington constituency?
RMG: Well, I am actually roughly
their age, which is quite useful. All
the other candidates are certainly
not in their early twenties. First of
all I want to abolish tuition fees,
and be a strong voice in that area of
policy. I’d want to make sure that we
increase investment in science and
engineering education in Britain. I’m
also genuinely personally interested
in mathematics and astrophysics in
particular, and evolutionary biology.
I think that, like again, it sounds very
pretentious but, I want to defend
the fact that we need knowledge and
understanding for its own sake, which
not enough politicians do. Including
in my own party.
I want to be somebody who actually
defends what it is to be a student,
in addition to championing British
universities internationally and in
parliament.
I should add the Lib Dems have
introduced a postgraduate loan
system for the first time, which I want
to spend quite a lot of time working
on how we expand thatw when it’s
introduced in 2016. I think Imperial
would really benefit from that. One
more thing, I’m also very interested
in the legalisation of cannabis, which
is obviously something that students
are interested in.
JR: Do you feel that the coalition
has been a success?
RMG: Yes. Because, bearing in mind
nobody thought it would be a success
at all, the Liberal Democrats have
achieved a huge amount that we
would obviously never have achieved
otherwise. We’ve introduced the
pupil premium for schools that
have particularly large numbers of
pupils who aren’t very well off. We’ve
abolished income tax for everyone
earning under £10,000 which the
"Rifkind is
completely
hopeless."
