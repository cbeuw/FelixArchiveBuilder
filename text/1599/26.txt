Fireworks – A carnival of horror
Death. Darkness.
Claustrophobia. Darkness.
Madness. Darkness. Dalia
Taha’s new play Fireworks is not the
celebration that the title suggests.
Telling the story of two families
battling for sanity in a besieged
Palestine, Fireworks examines how
children rationalise and interact with
war and death, a jolting and twisted
dichotomy.
I was apprehensive before going
to see Fireworks. I had read about it,
about the subjects it covered. I knew
it was not going to be an easy watch.
But it was definitely going to be a
fascinating new take on the impact
of warfare. The play is a product of
a nearly two decade partnership the
Royal Court has had with Palestinian
writers, developing their untapped
talent and unique life experience
to create some wonderful pieces of
theatre.
And what a way it started. The set:
a single concrete room, suffocating
in its rigidity, faded azure walls,
minimal belongings, a crypt for the
living. Dramatic lighting plunged us
between total blackness and glimpses
of their life, snapshots of a daily scene
that photographed the surreal scene
for us. We are constantly cut between
these very short scenes throughout
the whole play, highlighting the
fleeting nature of the moments and
lives we were witnessing.
We are presented with two
families: Khalid (Saleh Bakri),
his wife Nahla (Sirine Saba) and
their daughter Lubna (Shakira
Riddell-Morales) and Ahmad (Nabil
Elouahabi), Samar (Shereen Martin)
and their son Khalil (Yusuf Hofri).
They are linked by their shared
tower block and shared misery.
Through them, two starkly different
stories are played out, yet they are
inherently intertwined by this
shared experience, their behaviours
completely understandable given the
situation despite being unexplainable
when viewed without context. It is
a wonderful yet scaringly poignant
insight into this inhuman situation
we find these individuals, each coping
and rationalising in their own way.
Coping. That and how different
coping methods interact in such a
stressful situation is what the piece
is about. Whether it be revenge,
religion, insurmountable grief,
distraction, violence or escapism,
each character has their own way of
tackling this reality. Rockets become
fireworks, dreams become reality,
everything melts into an amalgam of
fantasy and misery.
Lubna’s story plays out on
the background of her brother
Ali, “martyred” by crossfire in a
horrifying accident. Her mother
Nahla is utterly broken, completely
grief-stricken that she wants to take
her own life just so she can return
to him. Khalid, her husband, copes
by distracting himself with broken
radios. Lubna, jealous of her brother’s
attention, does anything to win her
parents back.
Khalil on the other hand has been
deeply disturbed by the war around
him, moulded by its perversion into
a violent individual that his father
describes as a “punishment”. His
mother uses him as a way to escape
reality, preserving him in an eternal
childhood so they can escape away
together to a distant planet in the
games. But he has no interest in
that. His world is one of guns, spies
and death. His father, disturbed by
his wife’s psychological castration
of their son is determined to turn
him into a man. He teaches him
how to shave. He teaches him about
martyrdom. It is a twisted reality.
What I think is good about this

Kamil McClelland examines the Royal Court’s new piece of Palestinian theatre
"This is not
a political
play. This
is a play
about how
unhappiness
can twist
all the
humanity
we take for
granted."
"The set:
a single
concrete
room,
suffocating
in its
rigidity, a
crypt for
the living."
play is that it does not at any time
explicitly mention Israel, making the
story applicable to any war zone in
which children or in fact any civilians
are caught up. This is not a political
play. This is a play about people
and about how unhappiness and an
unnatural situation can twist all the
humanity we take for granted. Adults
escape reality by turning life into a
fantasy, a game. Children age much
too young, with games filled with
the death and violence that they see
around them, as if that is normality.
Child actors are troublesome
for me. Call me biased but I find it
difficult to engage with them like I
can with adults, perhaps due to their
inherent lack of experience, their
inelastic emotional range or their
grating voice! There is little that can
be done in a play that is ultimately
about child psychology but I found
the performances of Hofri and
Riddell-Morales fell slightly short. I
guess I’m the bad guy now!
However, overall the acting was
not too bad and you did find yourself
utterly engrossed in their suffering
as the story crescendoed to its bitter
climax. “I want to tell you a story”.
Lubna, dressed in her Eid clothes,
concludes the play, the story of her
and her family’s life not as reality
but as a mere story, as if it didn’t
exist, as if the whole story of their life
was just a dream. It is chilling, the
perfect ending to a play that leaves
you feeling deeply uncomfortable,
provoking you to react to a drama
that is much too real just to be a story.
It must still be happening throughout
Palestine to this day and throughout
any war zone across the world where
innocents are forced to face realities
that they never chose. I look forward
to Taha’s future productions. She
shows plenty of promise and sheds on
a new light on this age-old story.
Fireworks is at the Royal Court until
14th
March. Tickets are £20, £10 on
Mondays
