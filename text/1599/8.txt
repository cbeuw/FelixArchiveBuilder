Jihadi John identified as
Westminster graduate
Sources at the US Government
have confirmed the identity of
‘Jihadi John’ to be Mohammed
Emwazi, a computing graduate of
the University of Westminster.
‘Jihadi John’ is featured in videos and
pictures showing the beheading of a
number of Western hostages.
Following the announcement
by the press of the identification,
Westminster’s Students’ Union has
postponed last night [Thursday]’s
“Who is Mohammed?” event due to
“increased sensitivity and security
concerns”.
The Union had previously issued
a statement supporting the running
of the event despite criticisms from
students.
Mr Emwazi, from West London,
completed studies in computer
programming at the University of
Westminster, graduating six years
ago.
The University has released a
statement expressing their shock at
the revelation of the identity.
They also highlighted that they
“are working to implement the
Government’s Prevent strategy to
tackle extremism”.
Imperial College Union has
condemned Prevent as it discourages
the free expression and analysis
of ideas and impinges on a basic
function of universities: introducing
students to a variety of opinions and
encouraging them to analyse and
debate them.
Mr Emwazi has been a person
of interest to the British Security
Services for some time: his name
appears in a list of individuals
connected to an extremist network
in UK Court Proceedings from
2010, and was detained by counter-
terrorism officials in 2010 when he
visited London.
The International Centre for
the Study of Radicalisation said
it believes the identification to be
accurate, saying that the naming
of Emwazi shows that “whatever
efforts are made, the ability to mask
one’s identity is limited or in fact
impossible”.

Imperial team prepares
for mission to the Sun
Ateam of researchers from
the Space and Atmospheric
Physics group has reached
a new milestone in their mission to
study the sun’s magnetic field.
Solar Orbiter is a European Space
Agency (ESA) mission that hopes to
improve our understanding of the
solar wind, a stream of plasma that
is released from the atmosphere of
the sun. The spacecraft, which will
be launched from Cape Canaveral in
October 2018, will travel closer to the
sun than any mission ever before.
The seven year mission will carry
several instruments to analyse and
measure the solar wind, including a
magnetometer designed and built by
the Imperial team, lead by Principal
Investigator Professor Tim Horbury.
A test model of the magnetometer
was recently sent to Airbus Defence
and Space in Stevenage, where the
Solar Orbiter spacecraft is being
constructed.
The spacecraft must be capable of

withstanding both scorching heat on
the surface that faces the sun and the
coldness of space on the opposite side,
which will always be shaded from
the star. The magnetometer must
also cope with the strong vibrations
during the launch of the NASA rocket
which will carry Solar Orbiter into
space.
Once in orbit around the sun,
the project team will be able to
make precise measurements of the
heliospheric magnetic field, which is
key to understanding the origins of
the solar wind. Ultimately the Solar
Orbiter mission aims to provide
insight into the sun’s effects on the
rest of the solar system.
