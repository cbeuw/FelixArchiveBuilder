Amersham overrun by pumpkins
On Saturday 21st
February
2015, the Recreational Clubs
Committee held its annual
Night Hike, a team orienteering-style
competition held at night in the
countryside around London, open
to all students, staff and alumnus of
Imperial. This year the competition
returned to its original base of
Amersham, Buckinghamshire and
with a record 44 teams and 151
competitors, it was set to be a night to
remember!
At 17:15, the RCC Exec set off from
London with much moaning from
Stephen about how the minibuses
were so much worse to drive than a
vintage fire engine…
The team arrived at the base in
Amersham at around 6, to set up
the registration and start desks and
unload 150 people’s worth of food
for breakfast from the minibus! The
night was very cold, with a clear starry
sky, which meant the added benefit
of a bright moon. At 19:00 the first
teams began to arrive at the hall,
ready to venture out into the night…
The competition starts when the
teams are given their map: they then
have 6 hours to gain as many points
as possible by visiting checkpoints
worth varying numbers of points.
The checkpoints take the form of
questions, adding an extra difficulty
of trying to find a specific answer
in the dark! The first team out were
The Nocturnals at 19.36. From then
on there was a steady flow of teams
arriving and leaving. At 11.30 the last
team left and we were all able to grab
an hour’s sleep.
Despite a few mishaps with blisters
and low blood sugar involving
minibus pick-ups, all teams
completed the 6 hours and arrived
back at the hall between 01:00 and
0515, a little cold and tired but all
thoroughly enjoyed themselves! Most
teams tried to settle down and sleep
a little in the hall but by the time
the last few times had arrived back
conditions were quite cramped!
At 05:00 the organising team began
the mighty task of cooking breakfast
for 150 people. This involved
scrambling 300 eggs, cooking over
200 slices of bacon and trying not to
burn 60 tins of beans to the bottom
of the pan. Plus the added pressure
of 150 people getting more and more
impatient at the smell of food! And
that’s before the even more mighty
task of the washing up.
After breakfast the last item on the
agenda was the prizegiving, the most
exciting part of the night!
First up was the best team name
and most checkpoints visited, which
were won by Hike Milligan and The
Perpetual Motion Squad respectively.
Next up was the best fancy dress.
Runners up were Matt’s Bitcheeez
but the prize of £20, trophy and
chocolates went to The Spookies with
‘spooky’ pumpkin costumes including
hats!
Next up was the prize for the
winning team in the running
category, which was taken by team
‘You think you know it all, but you
just don’t’ who beat Cunning Stunts
to first place. They won the £40 prize
and trophy with an impressive 2150

Chem Eng place
sixth in Quidditch
competition
4am on a weekday morning is
rarely a time you see students
trooping into College,far less
seemingly excited about the
prospect of doing so.Yet this
was the scene on Tuesday 17th
February,as 150 Chemical
Engineering students set off to
Birmingham to compete in their
annual sports competition–
Frank Morton’s.
A competition like no other,
this year it pitted 29 Chem Eng
departments from across the
UK against each other in a range
of sporting challenges. As with
most things,Imperial has a
strong reputational pedigree,
having won the competition
seven times,most recently two
years ago in Newcastle.
2015’s edition involved
nineteen different sports,
ranging from conventional
ones such as 5-a-side football,
basketball and netball to non-
conventional ones like laser
quest,crazy golf and Quidditch
which made its debut this year.
The eventual winners were the
hosts with 60 points,leaving
runners-up Strathclyde in the
dust with 24. Overall Imperial
came a creditable sixth; gaining
first place in dodgeball,second
in tennis and third in rounders
and the sports day event.
After the sporting activities
and awards ceremony,held in
the Barclaycared Arena,were
concluded,the famous Frank
Morton’s afterparty celebrations
began. The IC Crowd set about
proving Imperial Chem Eng
students can do more than just
size pumps,belting out 90s
classics from the likes of Spice
Girls and S Club 7 with gusto.
As ever it was a fantastic event
enjoyed by all who attended,
proving tthat engineers really
can operate on very little sleep!
2016’s edition will certainly be an
event to look forward to.

points, the highest score of the night!
Finally was the hotly contested
prize for the winning walking team.
In third place was ‘Frolicking naked
through a field’ with 1200 points.

with 1690 points. But THE first place
£40 and trophy went to Clive’s Bicycle
Repairs with a staggering 1860 points!
Overall all the teams had a great
time!
Particular thanks must go to
Richard, Stephen, Ellen and Jack who
helped with the manned checkpoint,
registration, driving and breakfast –
thanks!
