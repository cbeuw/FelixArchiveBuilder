"The
ROH’s Der
Fliegende
Höllander
is an epic
journey
across both
rough and
calm seas "
Astrip of water runs across
the stage, which itself
slopes upstage, with vague
impressions of a ship’s windows in
the distance. Daland’s crew shuffles
around, clearing up after a storm as
Daland announces that they will be
heading home soon, and Senta, his
daughter, will be waiting for him.
This opening scene heralds the well-
known tale of the Dutchman, who
is bound to sail the seas for eternity
unless a maiden swears to be true to
him; Senta, deeply moved by his fate,
swears to follow him unto death.
This is a stormy story of love and
obsession, fate and tragedy, and Tim
Albery’s second revival of Wagner’s
masterpiece fleshes it all out.
Running at two and a half hours with
no interval, the production doesn’t
let up. However, I did not notice the
time, captivated as I was by Andris
Nelsons’ conducting of the beautiful
music, that rises and falls like waves
at sea.
Adrianne Pieczonka’s Senta was
magnificent, with a rounded, strong
voice that carried both the girl’s
devotion and desperation to escape.
Having seen many favourable reviews
of Bryn Terfel’s Dutchman, I had
been looking forward to seeing him
live but unfortunately, the Welsh
bass-baritone was down with a cold
on the night I went and was replaced
by Egils Silins who debuted with the
Royal Opera House as the Dutchman
in 2011. Given that he apparently
flew over to London at short notice,
his delivery was impressively smooth.
From the beginning, right through
to the last charged confrontation
between the Dutchman and Senta,
the set is sensitive and mature – some
ropes here, a bridge there, a ladder
in the corner – always sketching a
scene without being too literal. That,
and the masterful lighting were
greatly helpful in fleshing out the
passions and the Dutchman’s dark
struggle against his fate. For Silins’
Dutchman, the desperation is clear,
but it is a measured desperation laced
with resignation to his fate.
A delightfully energetic chorus
also supported the production; the
factory scene where the women’s
chorus sang in response to Senta’s
obsession with the ballad of the
Dutchman was a visual treat, while
one of the most gripping scenes was
the exchange between the crew of the
ghost ship and Daland’s own crew.
Daland’s raucous, cheerful crew tried
to be friendly with the dark, brooding
ghost crew, and what ensued was an
impressive coordinated choreography
with strong singing, highlighting
the ghost crew’s anguish, as if the
Dutchman’s tragedy had a physical
manifestation in his crew.
The last scene was somewhat
perplexing, however, with Senta
clutching a model ship and careering
across the stage, sobbing. In the
original story, she throws herself into
the sea after the Dutchman as he sails
away, thinking he was sparing her a
terrible fate. That is the final act of
devotion and her word was proven
true; the Dutchman is thus released
from his curse and the two ascend
into the sky. Such a conclusion is the
only suitably dramatic end to such a
story, where despair is redeemed by
a final act of devotion. A hapless and
miserable Senta mourning her love at
a model ship just does not quite cut it.
At times brooding, at times
light-hearted and at times heart-
wrenching, the Royal Opera House’s
Der Fliegende Höllander is an epic
journey across both rough and calm
seas, with passionate voices drifting
in the wind, carried along by majestic
orchestral music.
Der Fliegende Holländer was on at the
Royal Opera House 5th

WestartwithJingjieCheng’s
reviewoftheRoyalOpera
House’sproductionofWagner’s
masterpieceDiefliegende
Holländer.This opera is the
true meaning of a journey,a
production with no interval,
simply one single narrative
that ebbs and flows across the
waves like the Dutchman’s own
vessel.In Tim Albery’s second
revival of this work,he has
managed to harness all of the
turmoil,anguish and majesty of
Wagner’s work,in what seems
to be a production well worth
seeing.
Next,we are transported to
the near future in TheNether,
Duke of York Theatre’s new
production,reviewed by Fred
Fyles.The piece takes us into the
future of the Information Age,
where its sinister side quietly
emerges and the deepst depths
of human nature are allowed to
emerge from their abyss.
Palestine.The early 21st
Century.Once again under
bombardment.Fireworks
examines the daily realities
of these besieged peoples,
particularly in how children,
some 60% of Gaza’s population,
rationalise this distorted world.
And as madness envelopes
their parents,they are left to
understand the world in the only
way they know,as if it is all a
fantasy.
Finally,Fred Fyles visits the
Tate Britain to review a duo
of new shows that take us
on a journey into the past,to
the advent of photography
in Britain in SaltandSilver
1840-1860 and to the advent of
the industrialisation of art in
SculptureVictorious,the story of
scultpure in Victorian Britain.
Both are more historical reports
than anything else,exploring
the impact the tumultuous 19th
Century had on British art.
Tune in next week for the
1600th
issue of Felix,where the
Arts section shall feature as
part of a larger Culture section
alongside other sections such as
Film,Food,Fashion and Music.
It’s going to be big! I hope you’re
as excited as I am.
