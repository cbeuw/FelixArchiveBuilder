Imperial Falcons finish third in Loughborough
The Imperial Falcons baseball
team recorded a third place
position in the first ever M1
Series Tournament at Loughborough
on the 21st/22nd February,
after some strong performances
throughout the weekend and a
dramatic walk-off hit secured a win in
the final game.
On a brisk February morning,
the Imperial Falcons made the
long journey up to Loughborough
University to compete in the
inaugural M1 Series Tournament.
The Falcons began their
campaign batting first against the
inexperienced Sheffield Hornets.
Imperial made a bright start, going
2-0 up with no outs, after a hit from
captain Ashley (the fastest man in
Singapore), and a number of walks.
Sheffield recovered to strike out the
side, but were then held in the bottom
of the innings thanks to some strong
pitching from Zack.
The Falcons continued to pile on
the pressure in the second innings,
as left fielder and punmaster general
Stephane led off the inning with a
hit. Our top two batters eventually
came round to score, and despite two
quick outs, Sheffield were unable to
shut down the Imperial offense, as
they tacked on another run in the
inning. The Hornets fought back in
the bottom of the inning, but could
not sustain the pressure after some
tight fielding and a bad call by their
base coach.
After two of the first three Falcons
batters were struck out, the Imperial
offense came back strongly. Some
wayward Sheffield pitching and some
good hitting (particularly a double
by second baseman Rhys) scored five
runs for the Falcons, with the innings
ending after the mercy rule kicked
in. Once again, the Sheffield offense
could not find its groove in the
bottom of the inning, as Zack added
two more strikeouts to his tally for
the game.
After rookie right-fielder
Hridayarth drew a walk and Stephane
got on base with a hit, it looked like
a final flourish was on the cards.
Unfortunately, Imperial couldn’t
continue their good run of batting,
although it wasn’t necessary as the
Falcons started the bottom of the last
inning already up by nine runs. Some
good pitching and a fantastic sliding
catch by replacement catcher Marcel
(either that or he’d had enough of
standing up) meant that Sheffield
couldn’t even get on base, as Zack
struck out the last batter to end the
game 10-1 to Imperial.
After a long break in the warm, dry
students’ union, Imperial returned
to face the UEA Blue Sox, expecting
a much tougher test than what we’d
faced earlier. This proved to be the
case as Imperial failed to score in the
first inning, as our offense didn’t
fire, and our aggressive base-running
didn’t pay off. The Falcons kept UEA
to only three runs in the bottom
of the inning, however, as pitcher
Edoardo struck out two Blue Sox
batters.
The UEA defence was just as
miserly in the first inning, as they
brought on the same pitcher that
had frustrated the Falcons so much
during the Fall Cup. The next two
batters struck out, followed by
a fly-put to end the inning after
Stephane was hit in the hand by a
fastball (and now has one hand twice
as big as the other). The Blue Sox
then batted round in the bottom off
the innings to go 7-0 up, after some
strong hitting, despite some accurate
pitching by Edoardo.
As in the Fall Cup, Imperial started
to fight back in the third inning, as
a hit from first-baseman Ben set up
right-fielder Chris for an RBI single

Silver medals for the Imperial Kendo Club
Victory slipped through
Imperial’s grasp in the Kyu
grade tournament finals
against the first team from Kent
University, losing in a tie-break
match. Imperial team ended only
with silver medals in the end.
The match was nail-bitingly close
and the hall was filled with the sound
of cheering crowd and contestants’
shouting with every hit as a part of
Kendo’s spirit. Imperial pulled ahead
from Kent with a win after draws
from the first two members of the
team. Soon however, Kent managed
to catch up with a win in the final
pair, resulting in an overall draw.
A daihyosen (a tie-breaker between
representatives from each team) was
called to decide a winner and Ed Ying
was picked to fight for the Imperial
team as he had beaten his opponent
in his personal match. His opponent
for the daihyosen, Ed Pollard, was
the gold medalist in the individuals
tournament and Imperial’s Ed
unfortunately lost to a men (head)
cut.
In addition to the medals from the
team competition, Ed Ying also won
a bronze medal for the Kyu grade
individuals competition, losing to
his rival, Ed Pollard, who had beaten
him in the daihyosen. Jason Li won
an award and a new shinai (kendo
sword) for his display of fighting
spirit, shouting down more than a few
opponents.
The Imperial second team, on the
other hand, didn’t manage to go
far into the tournament. The team
grinded to a halt in the second round
when they had to go against Imperial
first team. In this battle of brothers,
Imperial 2 was eliminated, paving
the way for Imperial 1 to go further
ahead.
“They were probably scared of
Imperial teams. That’s why the
tournament structure pitched us
against each other.” This was the
general sentiment among the club
members.
The University Taikai (tournament)
consisted of 12 teams from various
universities and the competition
itself was further divided into
individuals and teams tournaments
for Kyu (novice) and Dan (advanced)
grade divisions. The team
competition format was a sequence
of five 1v1 fights where the results
of each are combined for an overall
score.
Yoshikawa-sensei, coach and teacher
of the Imperial Kendo club, said
that coming second was a bit sad,
given that we were in the lead for
the majority of the match. It was a
combination of many mistakes that
could have been avoided.
Last year, Imperial came third in the
University Taikai. As Imperial came
second this year, Alan Su, the club
captain, was confident that this is just
a pit stop before reaching first place
next year.
“The victory train is slow but
inevitable,” he said.
The next year’s competition will
take place in the Ethos gym where
Imperial is the host. Being on home
turf should help make the victory
train reach its destination smoothly.
In the week before the University
Taikai, the club was visited by
Shigakukan University who came
from Japan to host training sessions
for the Imperial club and the British
Kendo team. The Japanese students

to bring home the Falcons’ first run.
The Imperial defence tightened up
in the bottom of the innings, holding
the Blue Sox to a single run as Zayd
made a fantastic catch in right field.
The Falcons were tentatively hopeful
going into the final inning, as the
star pitcher from UEA was replaced.
Unfortunately, it wasn’t to be, as the
Imperial rally didn’t quite come after
two fly-outs ended the inning. The
Falcons’ fielding was tight in the
bottom of the inning, although by
this time we had turned to damage
limitation as the game was over, with
the Blue Sox running out 8-1 winners.
The remainder of the tournament will
be in next week’s sport section.
took the time to train with Imperial
club members and their sensei
imparted valuable lessons, which
helped the club gain an edge in the
University Taikai. The club would
like to give thanks to the Shigakukan
University and British Kendo team
for their cooperation.
