Emails sent to the ICU Rugby
Football Club (ICURFC)
mailing list recently have
contained misogynistic content,
despite previously being warned by
Imperial College Union to moderate
their “inappropriate” language.
One was sent earlier this month,
describing players on the IC Netball
team as “too loose,” whilst another
described the Royal Veterinary
College (RVC) netballers as “easy
pickings.”
The emails, sent to the entire
ICURFC mailing list, were sent by the
social secretaries of the club.
The team took part in the Netball
pub-crawl, back in the beginning
of February. One of the emails
informed the team that they were
planning to leave the Union bars later
than expected however, “due to the
netballers being too loose.”
The team also planned a social
with at the RVC, which took place
this Wednesday. The email sent to
the team by the social secretaries
described how, due to the high
number of women at RVC, their
netball team is starved of “male
contact,” and how last time they
attended, the team saw a “86% success
rate, and certain individuals claimed
to have necked 31 different ladies.”
Felix contacted the team, and were
told that the “The comments were
written by [the social secretary] and
Misogynistic emails sent out to Rugby
Club mailing list
do not represent opinions held by any
members of the club.”
Felix was also asked not to reveal
the identities of those who sent the
emails, after one of them contacted
Felix directly and told us how they
were in the process of applying for
internships, and didn’t want their
name printed online.
The club captain has since revoked
the mailing list privileges from the
social secretaries, and has warned
the rest of the committee that such
content is inappropriate.
They also told Felix that they were
sorry the emails were released in the
first place.
The club captain said: “These
messages were not the approved by
the club. For years the mailing list has
always been accessible by all members
of the committee, however as the
committee grew these rules were not
changed and with recent events we
now made it so all emails must be
approved by somebody of the Exec
committee.
“We are very sorry that it took us
this long to update our system and
that it took someone to have to send
out these emails for us to notice it
needed updating.”
Felix also spoke to RVC, who told
us: “The RVC Student Union does
not condone the use of sexist or
derogative language used in the
email, and we would not allow any
RVC teams to act in such a manner.”
The RVC Rugby Football Club (RVC
RFC) stated that, considering the
“university rugby scene”, the email
could be “far worse.”
Despite that, they also added: “The
RVC RFC does not endorse the sexist
language used in the email, nor does
the club like the women of the RVC
Netball Club being objectified in the
way that they have.
“The email suggests a lack
of modern thinking and
thoughtlessness.”
The RVC Netball Captain appeared
slightly more forgiving, telling Felix
that: “We understand that the email
was aimed at a specific audience and
that the boys would not speak in this
manner to any of our girls.
“They were charming and polite
throughout the social and no girls felt
there were any sexist or derogatory
remarks made that evening- Perhaps
the language was a crude attempt to
tempt more boys to attend the social.
“I have had no complaints or
comments of any kind and it seems a
shame that one member’s moment of
stupidity could ruin the reputation of
the whole rugby club.
“I am sure this will not happen
again and that our relationship
with the IC rugby club with not be
affected.”

Felix how one of the tasks was to write
based on words found on the front of
a “blind book date” from SciFi.

Sciences) gave a lecture on the role
of audiences in the development of
music.
