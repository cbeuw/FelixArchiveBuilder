longer,” she wanted to “thank the
Academy, because my husband is
younger than me.”
Tom Cross used his speech for Best
Editing to thank Damien Chazelle,
the director responsible for Whiplash,
much as Milenan Canonero thanked
Wes Anderson for her Best Costume
Design Oscar for her work on The
Grand Budapest Hotel.
Pawel Pawlikowski, the director
of Best Foreign Language Film
winner Ida, took the sentimental
route, remarking that after make a
film “about the need for silence and
withdrawal,” he and his team were
now at “the epicentre of noise and
excitement. Life is full of surprises.”
There were other highlights beyond
the acceptance speeches, not least a
callback to John Travolta’s infamous
butchering of Idina Menzel’s name.
Menzel and Travolta presented the
award for Best Original Song (which,
of course, Menzel won last year with
Frozen’s ‘Let It Go’).
After being introduced as “Glom
Glazingo” by Menzel, Travolta
admitted “I deserve that,” before
going on to carress Menzel’s face,
describing her as “the wickedly
talented Idina Menzel,” to cheers
from the crowd.
It was simultaneously amusing
and uncomfortable, and Menzel’s
expression definitely suggested
the latter. Travolta’s publicist later
claimed the face-touching had been
"Life is
full of
surprises.”
rehearsed, but that remains dubious.
Throw in his borderline sexual
harassment of Scarlett Johansson
on the red carpet before the event,
as he appeared behind her shoulder
to plant a kiss on her cheek, and
Travolta didn’t exactly do himself
any favours. It was all a bit creepy,
but it seemed to go unremarked –
even encouraged – by those at the
ceremony.
The Academy are still very far
away from being the progressive,
liberal organisation they occasionally
try to be, but at least some of their
members – or at least, the people
their members chose to honour –
have strong opinions on the world,
and aren’t afraid to broadcast them.
"At least

members

strong
opinions.”
