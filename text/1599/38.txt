IC Tempest
takes Crystal
Palace by
storm
Last Sunday four athletes from
Imperial College took second
place at the Legacy Cheer and
Dance championships at Crystal
Palace National Sports Centre.
Imperial College Tempest,
consisting of Kayla (flyer),Ben
(back spot),Fez and Daryl (both
bases),have only been training
together for three months,and
this was the first time they’d all
been on a competition mat at the
same time.In fact,the first time
that they had run the routine with
music was the day before.
IC Tempest is a part of Imperial
College Titans,the College’s
cheerleading programme.
Competing separately to the
team,they perform routines with
a complete focus on stunting,
avoiding jumps,tumbling and a
dance routine.Tempest is one of
two group stunts running with
Imperial this year.
With Ben nursing a back injury,
aggravated by competing earlier
in the day,the group were only
able to finish one full run through
of the routine on the warm-
up mat,but all of the stunts
thankfully hit (more or less) and
Tempest made their way gingerly
towards the holding area for
teams ready to compete.
Nerves overcame the group on
the mat slightly,and they were
unable to put in the twisting
dismounts and pike basket,but
the score still came in at 83.5 out
of a possible 100.
Two of the team members
competed again in the same day
for Inferno Cheer Avengers,one
of the London All Star teams.
Inferno Cheer also plays host
to two other students from
Imperial,and three alumni.
Mariza and Nikki,having cheered
for three years with Imperial,
also competed their group stunt
for the first time,taking second
place within their category,
and qualifying for the national
competition,held at the Copper
Box Arena in the Olympic Park.
Imperial College Tempest
will perform again in April at
the British Cheer Association
University competition,at which
the full team,Imperial College
Titans,will compete for the first
time this year.They’ve taken on
board the judge’s comments,and
are pumped to get up to Telford
and bring home Grand Champs.

IMPERIAL IMMORTALS
If someone had tried to sit down
and write a script for this Cricket
World Cup, it would have already
been tossed into the bin. With one-
day cricket’s most coveted prize up
for grabs, the unexpected tends to
happen. Since Ireland’s win over the
West Indies on the 3rd day of the
tournament, it was obvious that this
World Cup would be full of surprises.
The cricketing Gods have shown
us that they do indeed possess a keen
sense of irony – there was talk at
the start of the competition that the
2019 World Cup will be cut down
from 14 teams to just 10, limiting the
opportunities for associate members,
but they soon showed us who’s boss.
After Ireland’s win, Scotland tried
hard to spoil a World Cup favourite’s
best-laid plans when it met New
Zealand in Dunedin, taking seven
scalps to give New Zealand a scare
before the Black Caps sealed victory.
Afghanistan also looked set to cause
a major upset against Sri Lanka on
Sunday after it had already ensured
Bangladesh had to work hard for
victory in Canberra. And this is only
10 days into the World Cup! Oh, the
Excitement!
However, it must be noted that
most World Cups tend to follow the
career trajectory of the Rolling Stones:
starting out with thrills, youth and
vigour, peaking around the middle,
then dragging on and on and on in
an increasingly desperate attempt to
excite an audience that long ago saw
all it had to offer.
We’ve had our fair share of thrills
already in India v Pakistan and
Australia v England. England lost,
naturally, but they didn’t emerge
from their thrashing empty-handed.
As Moeen Ali put it last Tuesday,
they got a “wake up call”, as well as
nabbing a minor umpiring injustice
which they can now whinge about for
the next couple of months.
Pakistan again showed everyone
how generous a nation they are by
gifting India (more specifically,
Shikhar Dhawan) runs, and then
staying true to tradition and
collapsing faster than the Greek
economy.
We even had 3 out of 3 wins for
New Zealand, which must’ve pleased
those pundits who had tipped New
Zealand as favourites in the belief
that this makes them stand out from
the 99.9% of other pundits who also
tipped New Zealand to win the World
Cup.
Australia have played 1 and had 1
Sunday 22nd February saw the
Immortals play their last BUCS
game of the season at Fortress
Harlington against the Bath Killer
Bees. Earlier in the season the Killer
Bees beat the Immortals 13-6 at their
swamp of a pitch at high altitude.
However, we were keen to change
things on our own glorious pitch.
Bath kicked off to start the game and
the Immortals offense took the pitch,
where they started to pound the ball
and run hard at the Bath defence. This
set the tone for the game, which saw
the hard-hitting, rapid and explosive
Immortals run game drive down the
pitch multiple times hindered only
by mental errors. However, the first
few drives had a sense of déjà vu as
the Immortals struggled to finish and
score points. The defence were not
playing at their usual level with so
many people playing out of position
and injuries to key players although
some players certainly ‘stepped
up’ (thank God for Angry Will’s
Facebook post).
Marin ‘Wet Burp’ Tuleu got himself
an interception by grabbing the ball
straight out of a receiver’s hands
and Markus ‘Bobblehead’ Mohr,
playing out of position, got a tasty
tackle for a loss. However, even
through the efforts of the defence
Bath scored twice in the first half
meaning the Immortals were down
14-0 at half time. The defence came
out after the half and played with all
the physicality and fire we are used
to seeing from them and it seemed
that momentum had swung the
Immortals way. The offense came out
and played hard, running strong and
passing well to drive down the pitch.
This culminated in a beautiful pass
from Toby Sinclair to Noach Ben-
Haim who made perhaps the catch of
the season juggling it whilst getting
illegally interfered with but never
losing the ball to score the Immortals
first touchdown. This gave the
Immortals a boost that was short
lived as Bath scored again twice.
However, on the last play of the game
Bami ‘Twerkteam’ Falana broke free
for a 75 yard run after some great
personal play and good blocking
all round and scored perhaps the
naughtiest rushing touchdown of the
season.
The games Most Valuable Players
were: Markus ‘Bobblehead’ Mohr
(Line MVP for making plays on both
lines and playing out of position),
Mad Dog Pecs (Offense MVP for
playing well out of position, picking
up yards and only biting off 3 ears
on the day), Angry Will Nicholson
(Defensive MVP for playing hard
while injured and making hits all
day) and Bami ‘Twerkteam’ Falana
(Overall MVP for great play every
down, running hard and fast and
punishing the Bath defence).
The team is un-flattered by the score
line but a good game was had. Special
thanks to the Imperial College Titans
Cheerleaders for coming down and
supporting the team throughout
the horrible weather. The next time
the team plays it will be in our own
VARSITY MATCH against King’s
College Regents on the 8th March for
the Londonbowl trophy at Honor Oak
Park, come down and support ya bois.
match abandoned due to rain & Sri
Lanka have had a mediocre start with
1 win and 1 loss.
The other big gun in the
tournament, South Africa, enjoyed
opening success against Zimbabwe
but couldn’t quite stomach the spicy
vindaloo that is the Indian Cricket
team. Crushed by 130 runs, South
Africa will need to bounce back
quickly, as it seems we may have a
new favourite on the cards…
