As some of you might already
know, this week was Eating
Disorder Awareness Week,
and I have decided what better
opportunity to talk about eating
disorders than in a mythbuster-
esque article debunking some of
the most prominent false facts that
surround these serious conditions.
I think we have all heard something
about eating disorders, it’s one of
those conditions that unfortunately
often gets poked fun at in the media
with really tactless jabs and often
insensitive cheap jokes that just
reinforce harmful stereotypes. So
without further ado, let’s bust some
myths.
Myth: Only white rich teenage
girls get eating disorders
I can’t even fathom how this
one came about other than sheer
ignorance. Let’s deconstruct and
debunk this with stats: eating
disorders affect up to 24 million
people of all races, cultures,
ethnicities, and socio-economic
backgrounds. It is estimated that
around 10-15% of all the people with
anorexia or bulimia are male, and
this is only on the lower end because
much fewer men seek treatment for
eating disorders. This stereotype
tends to cause people who don’t fit
into the ‘rich caucasian girl’ mould
to think they can’t really be suffering
from what they so clearly are, and it is
so damaging because fewer and fewer
people feel like they have a valid
reason to seek treatment and instead
suffering in silence.
Myth: It’s just about food
This one I understand. When
something is called an eating
disorder, your first thought is going
to be that as soon as someone just
gets their eating in order, everything
will be fine, but that’s not true.
Yes, developing and maintaining
healthy eating habits are essential
to recovery, but they’re not the only
factor involved. Eating disorders are
all about compulsive behaviours and
thinking patterns; a person with an
eating disorder can’t just ‘fix their
eating habits’ and suddenly be okay,
it’s the underlying thought patterns
that control the eating in the first
place, and those need to be addressed
so that the eating itself can be
improved. So please, think before you
tell someone to ‘just eat something’.
Myth: You can totally tell if
someone is suffering from an
eating disorder by just looking at
them.
False. The first thing to remember
is that there are several types of
eating disorders, and all of them
result in different body types. What’s
more is that not even the same type
of eating disorder cause the same type
of differences in body types. In fact,
many people who suffer from eating
disorders are of normal (medical)
weight, yet suffer from things like
bulimia.
Myth: People with eating disorders
are just shallow and have chosen to
behave the way they do.
As with all mental illnesses,
you don’t just wake up one day
and choose to have them. It is a
gradual process, often influenced
by countless different factors. It
usually arises from several different
life events which are in some way
associated with eating and body
image. Eating disorders are a result
of societal influence, personal stress
and triggers, and sometimes even
genetics. There is no one reason why
someone develops an eating disorder,
and it certainly isn’t out of a lifestyle
choice.
Myth: Eating disorders are just a
cry for attention, or a phase, and
they’ll go away on their own.
I cannot stress enough how much
this isn’t true! As I mentioned
before, eating disorders are serious
mental health issues and need to be
treated as soon as they’re detected
and by medical intervention. Eating
disorders have the highest mortality
rates out of all mental illnesses
because of the severe adverse physical
effects that accompany them, making
them the most dangerous. They can
result in heart and organ failure,
osteoporosis, and malnutrition
among a cornucopia of other
conditions. Because of this myth,
only 1 in 10 people suffering from
eating disorders seek treatment, and
only 35% of those receive treatment
specially catered towards their
condition.
Myth: Eating disorders are for life
and cannot be treated.
If you take one thing away
from this article, it should be this:
Although recovering from an eating
disorder takes time and effort, it is far
from impossible. There are various
facilities available to help people
with eating disorders through their
recovery process, and when given
proper treatment, over 80% of people
make at least a partial recovery. Yes,
it’s difficult, and yes, it takes a long
time, but it is definitely curable!
So please if you know someone who
might be suffering from an eating
disorder, or if you yourself are going
through it, remember that recovery
is possible. Be kind, gentle, and
understanding. Don’t judge others for
things they have no control over and
just be there to provide the support
they want and need.
IC Mentality’s Jess has posted a
wonderful guide on how to support
someone with an eating disorder on
their facebook page which I highly
suggest you check out! While you’re
at it, make sure to support their
campaign on the Union website,
they’re trying to do a wonderful thing
and deserve all the support we can
give them.
