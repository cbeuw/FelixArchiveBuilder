We interviewed Hangman employees for their
tips on growing a busi-
ness. In the race to get into the
1% before robots replace us,
starting a business is a tried
and tested strategy.
We visited the Hangman
headquarters, located in a
lake resort on the Moon, to
get some tips for young entre-
preneurs. The natural place to
start is with those whose job it
is to give this sort of advice, so
we consulted the Hangman management consultants,
most of whom told us to hire more management con-
sultants. Hangman executives following this strategy
were weary when the fifth new division of management
consultants were still giving the same counsel, but the
consultants explained that you can’t make money with-
out spending money and the best way to do that is to
“hire more management consultants”.

HANGMAN
Like any good naval ship, the Hangman headquar-
ters has a bridge, and under that bridge live some trolls.
Onetroll,HrangnirtheUgly,explainedsomethingshe
learnt working for the Dark Mage
of the East: “You really need to ask
yourself three questions: when’s
a good time to start planning fi-
nances, what’s the optimal finan-
cial goal, and
how should I go
about my finan-
cial plan? Then
you’ll need to
start thinking
about growth
and protecting your investments.
How involved with them should
you be? Is it better to be flexible or
stable?”
Another troll, one Chase W.
Phillips, had this to say about busi-
ness: “There’s no point even thinking about it because
all the minorities are just taking the jobs. My dad man-
Hangman Consultancy HQ
aged to get me a job interview with the head research
engineer at the company he owns and I lost it to this
other guy just because he was in a wheelchair. My dad
told me it was because the guy had 4 PhDs and a Mas-
ters but I think we all know what’s really going on.
These multimillion dollar companies are getting more
Marxist by the day.”
Hangman’s writers also contributed: Trevor Say-
trevor told us “surroubdn
ytourselkf with smart peo-
pyle”, Erin Onthesideof-
caution told us “never jeeo
toue eggs in one basker”, and
Sharin Iskarin told us “ex-
oasnd your pirtvolio”. We
didn’t have time to talk to any
editors. On the shop floor
we spoke to Darryl ‘Long Fe-
mur’ Jones, who told us about
some of the smaller details of
running a business, like arti-
cle word limits. “You’ve got to be careful when writing
something like this that you don’t run out of page spa-

“All quiet at Wilson” say Wardens
Subwardens and hall seniors at Imperial College
London’s Wilson Hall have reported unexpectedly
high levels of quiet and respectful obedience among
residents, sources confirmed this week.
In an exclusive interview with Hangman, warden
Samuel Norton explained that the students under his
supervision had risen to the challenge of lockdown ad-
mirably. He opined that “going into this, many people
thought that being forced to spend days on end locked
in would provoke students to rebel, but no!” He went
on to express that such docility “honestly left [him]
with very little to do”.
The behaviour is especially surprising given the usu-
al fanfare around the freshers’ experience, but clearly
students have found their own
introspective ways to deal with
this.
Speaking to some of the res-
idents we found that, while a
majority felt inconvenienced
by the consequences of a glob-
al pandemic, all invariably felt
that such grievances paled in
comparison to their “responsi-
bility as citizens, classmates, and
friends”. First year biochemist
Mandrew said told us “sure, I’d
rather be out drinking right now, but this term is but a
brief moment of what I pray will be a long and fulfill-
ing life”, at which point the group
of socially distanced students
behind him nodded wistfully in
unison. Another student, this
time physicist Dalum, did how-
ever have a complaint, saying that
“it’s irritating to be able to hear
the hum of the streetlights out-
side” when trying to sleep. The
hall leadership team have been
quick to respond to this, prom-
ising to provide more therapeu-
tic ambient noise at night in the
form of the early work of Enya and Brian Eno.
