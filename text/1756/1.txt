Professor Neil Ferguson has warned
that despite the month-long lock-
down new tough restrictions on move-
ments and contact will still be necessary
as Christmas socialising might spark a
“third wave”
Ferguson whose modelling has been
criticised for being too alarmist has told
reporters that evidence showed that
the restrictions imposed by Tier 2 and
3 rules were having an effect on COV-
ID-19 rates before 5th November when
a national lockdown began.
Speaking by video link to the House
of Lords Science and Technology Com-
mittee Fergusson told the Lords that re-
strictions would have to remain in large
parts of England in order to prevent cas-

ID-19.
He said: “We now have clear evidence

with more bad news
Hammersmith and Fulham council
have become the first in the capital
to provide 30 minute COVID-19 tests.
These are faster than the PCR tests done
by Imperial Testing hub.
The lateral flow swab tests which
works similarly to pregnancy tests uses a
paper platform that holds a number of
assaying SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal anti-
body. If COVID-19 antigens (fragments
of genetic material or proteins) are pres-
ent in the sample being tested then a col-
our changed occurs, alerting people of a
potential COVID-19 infection.
The council authorities have said that
they will soon receive enough testing
kits from the Government to be able to
carry out 20,000 tests a week from now
until the end of March 2021.
These tests will be made available to
key workers such as teachers and social
workers and the council has expressed
hope that they will be able to offer tests
to people wanting to visit elderly at risk
