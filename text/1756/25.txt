Lockdown advice: recovery
This week’s article we wanted to try
covering something slightly dif-
ferent: rest, stretching, and active re-
covery. For anyone doing sport, we’ve
always been taught practice make per-
fect, and pushing yourself to the limit is
what will make sure you get better. Re-
cently, it’s been found that rest and re-
covery days are just as important as the
exercise days; they allow your muscles
to regrow, it helps prevent injury, and
help your body not go into fatigue. Of
course, the amount of rest and recovery
is dependent on each person individual-
ly, however, since everyone does require
it at some point, we thought we might
provide some ideas to help. If you can, it
is a very good idea to measure your heart
rate first thing in the morning every day,
or every few days, and that way keep a
track of your resting heart rate. If, while
you are in a phase of heavy exercise, your
resting heart rate increases by five to ten
beats per minute than this is a very good
sign that you are either getting ill or over
fatigued and that you should take some
time out to recover. If you have a smart
watch that can measure heart rates,
then this will make this resting heart
rate tracking ex-
tremely easy. We
do understand
people take
recovery dif-
ferently: some
enjoy stretching
and meditat-
ing, while other
people enjoy
moving around
m o re / d o ing
lighter exercis-
es; both of these
forms are good and just as important
and beneficial. One of the easiest things
to do that can encompass both is walk-
ing. You can walk as quickly or slowly as
you want, listen to good music, and en-
joy some of the lovely views of the city
(wherever in the world you are!). It’s a
great way to let off some energy (even
though it sometimes may be frustrat-
ing as you aren’t moving as quickly as
you wish), but it puts low stress on your
joints, and you can go very far with-
out feeling too fatigued but still feel-
ing accomplished. The
weather outside hasn’t
gotten too cold yet
(but that doesn’t mean
it’s always pleasant to
walk around) and all
of the parks are just go-
ing through autumn,
so all the colours are
stunning. One of the
downsides to COVID
has been the fact that
life has moved indoors
and online, which does
make it much harder to get outside both
due to fear of the virus and also due to
the extra motivation needed to go out-
side purely for the purpose of exercise.
Yoga is a great activity to do that can
be both a very high intense exercise or
a really good stretching and meditation
session.Ifyou’veneverdoneyogabefore,
there are so many websites and videos
on YouTube that are really helpful and
easy to follow along! One of the main
tips I learned when stretching is tak-
ing really deep breaths. For any stretch
you’re working on, once you’ve hit your
limit of how far you’re stretching, take
a deep, full body breath in, and as you
breathe out push your body further to
stretch more. It always surprised me how
much further I could go. Do make sure
however that you don’t overstretch and
accidentally pull something. As always,
remember to listen to your body, if it is
telling you rest than that is exactly what
you should be doing to get the best re-
sults!
