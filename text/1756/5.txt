In order to put an end to the glob-
al coronavirus pandemic, researchers
around the world are working tire-
lessly to develop a vaccine to protect
against COVID-19. While vaccine
production usually takes multiple
years, a coronavirus vaccine is hoped
tobedevelopedwithin12-18months.
Vaccine testing can be split into 5
stages:
Pre-clinical – animal testing to see
whether the vaccine elicits an immune
response.
Phase I – healthy human volunteers
to determine safety and evaluate im-
mune response.
Phase II – hundreds of volunteers to
identify correct dosage.
Phase III – thousands of volunteers
toconfirmsafetyandefficacyvs.apla-
cebo.
Phase IV – studies on adverse effects,
long-termmmunityandvaccineusage
following the approval and licensing
of the vaccine.
The WHO is currently tracking the
progress of over 170 candidate vac-
cines; at Felix, we’ve chosen 5 of the
most promising candidates to follow,
so watch this space!
New Update: This week, Pfizer/Bi-
oNTech confirmed the 95% efficacy
of their vaccine, initially proposed
last week, while Moderna became the
second compant to release an eaely
analysis of their Phase III trials. Read
more below!

Another week, and another coro-
navirus vaccine manufacturer has
shared news that preliminary results
from their Phase III trials are over-
whelmingly positive. This time, the
vaccine is being developed by Moder-
na Inc., a US-based biotech firm, and
the efficacy from the study of 33,000
people was shown to be over 94%.
Moderna’s vaccine is designed using
the same concept as Pfizer/BioNTech’s
vaccine, i.e.. mRNA that drives the in-
dividual’s cells to produce antigens and
generate an immune response (read
about it in last week’s issue if you hav-
en’t already!) and requires two doses.
Similarly to last week, the results have
not yet been peer-reviewed, however
they still allow for cautious optimism.
It must also be noted that while 94.5%
and 90% seem like different numbers,
the vaccines they represent are likely to
have the same, or even reversed, efficacy.
As Imperial’s coronavirus vaccine lead
Prof. Robin Shattock tweeted: “[We
have] no idea what the efficacy will be
at 6-12m. Could be considerably lower.
Thedangeristhatthepublicwillbeusing
this % to ask for what they think is best.”
Despite the similarities in study size,
efficacy and technology, this vaccine has
a solid advantage over the previous can-
didate, in that it can be stored in temper-
atures of -20C over a 6-month period,
and in typical fridge-like temperatures
of 2-6C for up to a month. In

can only
be stored
in these
temp er-
a t u r e s
for about
a week and must be stored at -80C
otherwise – a real obstacle for low-
er-income countries around the globe.
However, while the vaccine may have
better shelf-life and storage conditions,
it might be more difficult to access in
the first place. Unlike last week’s vaccine
candidate, which the EU and UK have
both signed large deals for (200m and
40m, respectively), Moderna’s largest
deals thus far have been with the US for
100m doses (and an option for 400m
more), Japan, Canada and Switzerland,
with the EU commission only having a
‘potential purchase agree-
ment’ (that is, nothing set
in stone). The UK, mean-
while,scrambledtosecure
a mere 5m doses on Mon-
day when the news of
efficacy was announced.
Moderna’s vaccine is
also the most expensive
of the frontrunners,
costing around £40 for
the two required shots,
in comparison to Pfiz-
er’s £30, or Oxford/
AstraZeneca’s £3.
Nevertheless, as
the mood around the
world improves, it will still be
months before the vaccines will have
an effect on day-to-day life – so it is up
to governments and individuals to act
responsibly to control the spread of the
pandemic until they are widely available.

its coronavirus vaccine
Shortly after midnight UTC
on Monday 16th November,
the first operational crewed mis-
sion from American soil successful-
ly launched and subsequently docked
with the International Space Station.
On board the Crew Dragon space-
craft were NASA astronauts Com-
mander Michael Hopkins, Victor
Glover, Shannon Walker and JAXA
(Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agen-
cy) astronaut Soichi Nogushi. They
will join Russian cosmonauts Sergey
Ryzhikov and Sergey Kud-Sverchk-
ov, as well as fellow NASA astronaut
Kathleen Rubins, onboard the ISS for
a planned mission duration of 180 days.
