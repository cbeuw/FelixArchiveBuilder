Teams call.
This week you live it up
a little and have a wank
with the nice shower gel.
This week, while your
landlord isn’t pleased
about the blu-tac marks
left by the poster on your
wall, it’s really the gaping
escape tunnel behind it
that sets him off.
This week your flat mate
throws a wet blanket on
your grease fire party.
This week’s eviction
notice will pale in
comparison to next

Caption Contest Results
Don’t want to miss out on our next Caption Contest? Then watch this space-
and follow us on instagram @felix_imperial where you can keep an eye out for
the next competition on our story. Remember, we are not the cat food brand.
Last week, we challenged you to send us your funniest captions for the comic
on the right. Whilst there can only be one winner, we recieved lots of funny
responses (and some less funny), so here are some honourable mentions:
“You will be able to fly back to Earth in the travel window from December 3rd to
9th.”
“I don’t think apples go very well with cheese.”
“You must self-isolate here for 14 days.”
Of course, our very own Hangman editors couldn’t resist cracking a wise one.
Here are some of their ideas to be lambasted at your discretion:
“The Moon? Yeah, keep going 100,000 miles and it’s on your left.”
“You’re not here for the oil, are you?”
“Excuse me sir, do you have a moment to talk about our lord and saviour Jesus
Christ?”
Winner: “Fancy an apple? It’s 1/6th as forbidden up here.”
