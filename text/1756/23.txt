Public finance funds fossil fuels
The UK government has commit-
ted to reducing greenhouse gas
emissions so that by 2050 the country
produces net-zero emissions. A lim-
ited number of steps have been taken
over the last few years to support a just
transition to a net-zero economy. Next
month, the Sixth Carbon Budget is
to be published by the UK’s Climate
Change Committee, which is expected
to advise to the government on how
we may get to net-zero greenhouse gas
emissions in the UK. Here are some
actions that will likely be in the plan:
§ Energysupply:Quadrupleamount
of energy production by renewable
sources, such as wind and solar powera
§ Business : Move towards a circular
economy, bring in carbon taxes and start
a reskill/retrain programme for green
jobs
§ Residential : End the use of gas,
and convert boilers to be able to use
hydrogen or electric power, design and
retrofit homes to be energy efficient,
climate-resilient, re-design neighbour-
hoodstoprovideallnecessarygoodsand
services, decentralisation of work zones,
§ Transportation : Ban the sale of
petrol and diesel cars by 2035, reduce
the number of flights, stop subsidies for
companies intensively using oil and gas
without commitment to transitioning
to renewables, funding for research and
innovation for electric aeroplanes, more
electric vehicle charging points, invest
in electric battery recycling, promote
active travel such as walking and cycling
§ Food system : Reduce consump-
tion of beef, lamb and dairy, promote
more plant-based diets, reducing food
and packaging waste at industrial, com-
mercial and residential levels
§ Landscape : Nature recovery by
converting current farmland into for-
est, planting 1.5 billion trees across the
country, peatland restoration, green in-
frastructure, more flood defences
§ Systems : A sustainable and re-
silient food system, healthy models of
work which allow remote working and
lower carbon behaviours
According to figures from the UK
government, the carbon dioxide
emissions produced from 1990 to 2018
declined by 43.5%, which it thought
principally to be due to the shift away
from coal as an energy source. To en-
sure that emissions continue to move in
a downward trend, in 2008 the Climate
Change Act was enshrined in UK law,
committing the country to reduce all
greenhouse gases emissions by 80% (rel-
ative to 1990 levels). This Act was then
updated in 2019 to reduce all green-
house gas emissions by at least 100% by
2050. These commitments may seem
that everything is on track for reducing
emissions in the UK, however, in 2019
a report from the UK Climate Change
Committee stated that the UK’s policy
actions fell ‘well-short of those required
for the net-zero target’.
One of the pledges that the UK has
made, as part of the coalition of G20
countries, is to
end ‘ineffi-
cient’ fossil
fuel subsidies.
A recent re-
port from the
Overseas De-
velopment In-
stitute, a UK
based think
tank, tracks
the progress of
G20 countries
in phasing out
government
support and
public money
commitments
to fossil fuel production and consump-
tion to increase transparency and ac-
countability. Along with every other
G20 country, the UK is at risk of not
achieving the pledge of phasing out fos-
sil fuel subsidy commitments. Strangely,
the UK government denies that it pro-
vides any fossil fuel subsidies, under its
definition of the concept. Yet, between
2014-2018 the amount of public mon-
ey going to the fossil fuel industry in-
creased. The report found that the UK
and Russia provide the highest levels of
direct transfers and tax exemptions (per
unit of GDP) of all G20 countries. The
UK was also ranked as one of
the highest in showing signif-
icant support to fossil fuel use
(per unit of GDP).
The global energy policy
tracker found that since the
beginning of the pandemic un-
til the 11th of November, the
UK government has given £30
billion to support oil and gas
fossil fuel industries, which is
approximately £446 per cap-
ita. Some of these funds went
to projects such as the oil and
gas energy sector in Scotland
or national road-building pro-
grammes, and other funds
went to bailing out huge com-
panies such as Honda, Nissan, Baker
Hughes (oil industry company) and
Schlumberger (oilfield services provid-
er). The government also committed
£12.16 billion to clean energy (renew-
ables), 40,5% of the money put into oil
and gas industries and £182 per capita.
Looking at our COVID
response on a broader
scale, compared to 30
major economy oth-
er countries, the UK
ranked in 2nd place
(the USA in 1st!) in
fossil fuel fund com-
mitment during the
pandemic.
The UK’s Climate
Change Committee
recommends that the
government uses this
moment of crisis to cre-
ate a just transition and
a green recovery from
COVID-19 to de-
fine the fight against
climate change.
Green Party MP
Caroline Lucas also
highlights the im-
portance of a green
recovery: ‘This really
is a once-in-a-gener-
ation opportunity to
us on the path to a
greener, fairer future.
Going back to busi-
ness as usual would
be a one-way street
to climate disaster.’ This will involve re-
moving oil and gas subsidies away from
the budget and redirecting money into
protecting the most vulnerable affect-
ed by subsidy removal and into support
healthcare and social support. It is vital
to ensure that poor and vulnerable con-
sumers can still access and afford energy
as subsidies are reduced.
In the UK, 78% of current emissions
areproducedbytransportation,business
(commercial use), energy supply (burn-
ing fossil fuels) and residential heating.
To reach net-zero by 2050 the UK gov-
ernment needs to put into place much
more action on the pledges and policy
promised and needs to stop providing
support for coal exploration and trans-
portation with a quicker shift to renew-
able energy sources. We will see how the
government plans to manage the situ-
ation in the new carbon budget, which
will supposedly be presented by June
2021.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, the UK has committed more
money to fossil fuel industry than renewable or nuclear energy.
