Warren Buffett once said, “[Gold]
gets dug out of the ground in
Africa, or someplace. Then we melt it
down, dig another hole, bury it again
and pay people to stand around guard-
ing it. It has no utility.”
So what exactly happened to gold earli-
er this year?
On August 6, gold reached an all-
time high of $2,067 an ounce. Soon
after on August 31 silver surpassed $28
an ounce, a seven-year high. Safe haven
assets such as precious metals have been
popular during the pandemic. Figure 1
shows the relative performances of gold,
silver and platinum over the last year.
Lows can be seen in March, just as the
pandemic began taking hold and affect-
ing markets globally, but since then have
been growing, significantly so in Q3, be-
fore stabilising.
The jump in this quarter arose due to
major banks
maintaining
their expan-
sionary mon-
etary policy
stances and
l o n g - t e r m
bond yields
falling and
approaching
negative terri-
tory. While jewellery and, in the case of
gold, bank purchases were down, there
was record investor inflows into ETFs
backed by silver
and gold. Addi-
tionally, the re-
covery of indus-
trial activity has
led to the return
in demand for
silver and plati-
num.
Supply of pre-
cious metals was
also affected.
Recycling was
restricted due to
concerns of the
virus spreading
through the la-
bour force and
for similar rea-
sons mining was
disrupted. Gold
minesinMexico,
Peru and South
Africa were dis-
rupted, and in the case of South Africa
being the largest producer, platinum was
also affected.
TheWorldBankGroup
is predicting stable prices
for gold and platinum in
2021 as the economy re-
covers. Silver is expected
to drop around 14%.
Global consumption
of crude oil plummeted
in 2020 Q2 by 16 percent
as a result of COVID-19
lockdownmeasures,severelyaffectingoil
prices (Figure 2). The fall in consump-
tion was most notable in transport fuels,
particularly jet fuel which fell more than
60 percent as a result of the collapse in
air travel. Diesel consumption was the
least affected given its main use is to
transport goods by road and ships, but
still declined by nearly a quarter.
In response to this, global oil produc-
tion dropped by 12% in May. OPEC
and OPEC+ collectively agreed to pro-
duction cuts of 20% (9.7mb/d). Non-
OPEC countries such as USA and Can-
ada also cut production by 20%. The
OPEC group increased production by
2mb/d in August and plan another in-
crease in January 2021, depending on
the rate of economic recovery.
Oil consumption has started to re-
cover as lockdown measures are lifted.
Crude oil prices were nearly 40 percent
higher in 2020 Q3, although they re-
main around 30 percent below their
pre-pandemic levels. Worries about a
second wave in September caused prices
to fall slightly.
Oilpricesareexpectedtoaverage$44/
bbl in 2021, still significantly lower than
their 2019 level of $61/bbl. Demand
will be lower in almost all countries in
2021 than in 2019, with the notable ex-
ception of China. However, oil prices
and consumption are very sensitive to
economic changes and vaccine progress.
1. Pfizer’s vaccine news got everyone
jumping for joy this week- well, that is,
everyone but Zoom and the other stay-
at-home tech stocks that fell.
2. E-commerce penetration is expect-
ed to grow by a whopping 30% in 2020
thanks to COVID-19, but this is only
actually two years ahead of what ana-
lysts predicted.
3. The U.K. economy expanded 15.5%
inthethirdquarter,aweakerpacethan
its peers in Europe.
4. The Trump administration grant-
ed ByteDance a 15-day extension of a
divestiture order allowing a little bit
more time for TikTok to be sold.
5. Costco is selling $17.5k private jet
membership that lasts 1 year show-
ing the extent of the companies’ rich-
es, and analysts predict that Costco
Wholesale will submit a $9.62 EPS for
the current year.
6. On Thursday, the International En-
ergy Agency cut its forecast for global
oil demand saying that it doesn’t ex-
pect demand to rise significantlytill
late 2021 despite Brent Crude, the in-
ternational benchmark, up 8.11%.
