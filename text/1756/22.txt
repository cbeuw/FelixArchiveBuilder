The year of 2020 is probably one of
the worst years in history that oil
executives had hoped to find themselves
in.Justsevenmonthsago,theWestTexas
Intermediate (WTI) crude has shocked
the world with an almost 300% drop in
index price, trading at around negative
$37 per barrel.
What does it mean really?
Well, in short, you are actually pay-
ing the person with the oil to not give
you the oil! The reasons behind this
were the novel coronavirus that caused
oil demand to halt, and the supply cut
from the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) that had
not scheduled to come into effect weeks
later. With Pfizer and BioNTech report-
ing success of their coronavirus vaccine
trial earlier this week, the oil industry
supposedly looks brighter ahead. On the
contrary,variousentitiessuggestthatthe
global oil demand remains low, and oil
industry prospects heading into 2021
are extremely weak.
Earlier this week, the International
Energy Agency (IEA) cautioned that a
COVID-19 vaccine is unlikely to come
to the oil market’s rescue until late 2021
at the earliest, as the effect of the vaccine
will only show towards the end of next
year.Oildemandwouldcomelowerthan
initially forecasted due to the surge in
number of COVID cases across Europe
and the US, and social distancing meas-
ures governments have implemented to
halt the spread of the virus. In the mean-
time, global oil supply rose by 200,000
barrels/day from 91.2m barrels/day in
October, with production expecting to
rise further after the US recovers from
the Hurricane Zeta, and Libya restoring
production of 1m barrels/day within
four weeks after the eight-month block-
ade. The macroeconomic contributions
from weaker demand and increasing oil
supply will potentially deteriorate oil
prices further, deeming the December 1
OPEC meeting in an attempt to curb oil
productionandrebalancethemarketfor
slow progress crucially important.
Biden administration’s victory in the
US presidential election might further
complicate the oil industry, sending off
multiple contradictory market signals
and uncertainties. Under president Bid-
en, if the US and Iran manages to return
onthepathofdiplomacy,thereischance
that strict US sanctions on Iran’s oil ex-
ports could be eased, paving way for
around 2m barrels/day of oil supply, fur-
ther weakening oil price. However, some
of his other proposals such as limiting
new drills on federal territory could on
the contrary, shave off US oil produc-
tion. More importantly, US under Biden
might potentially be able to recover oil
demand given his commitment to tackle
COVID with his COVID-19 task force.
The uncertainties in oil price is re-
flected in the oil futures market. For
example, the Brent crude contract for
December 2023
can be bought
today at $48
per barrel, just
over $3 a barrel
over the next
three years from
the current oil
price. The De-
cember 2025
Brent crude
contract, which
seems distant
away from now
and the COV-
ID fear, is barely just $49 per barrel.
Consequently, shares from BP and Exx-
onMobil have both plummeted to be-
low their April 2020 lows, with oil exec-
utives struggling to find solutions, be it
investing more in renewables or praying
for the oil traders’ sympathy or the so
called “oil cycle” that supposedly cannot
be broken.
Contrary to the pessimistic oil mar-
ket, the gold industry is doing more than
just fine. Barrick Gold, the world’s sec-
ond biggest miner recorded a significant
threefold rise in adjusted
third-quarter profits
on the backdrop of
the surging price of
gold.
Gold prices set a
new record nomi-
nal high this year of
more than $2000 per
troy ounce, amid sus-
tained investor de-
mandforgold,which
has pushed prices up
26 per cent.
The above average
performance of gold is understandable
given that gold has always been in the
past considered a natural hedge against
economic recessions and currency vola-
tility.
Well, maybe now might be the right
time to move from investing in oil fu-
tures to buying gold after all.
Uncertainties in Oil Prices Beyond 2020
WEAKER DEMAND
AND INCREASING
OIL SUPPLY WILL
POTENTIALLY
DETERIORATE OIL
PRICES FURTHER,
“
Oil prices are unlikely to recover easily well into 2021, given the weaker demand outlook, coupled
with rising oil supply.

Oil, alongside other products such
as metals (copper, gold), livestock
and meat, energy (oil, natural gas),
and agricultural (grains) are clas-
sified as commodities, the basic
goods in our daily life.
Commodities are one of the most
important asset classes for invest-
ment. While they are not generally
suitable for individual investors,
commodities do provide an impor-
tant way to diversify investment
portfolio beyond traditional se-
curities for institutional investors,
such as hedge funds and private
equity funds. There are numer-
ous ways to invest in commodi-
ties, including futures, options,
contracts, and exchange-traded
funds (ETFs). Within the oil mar-
ket, there are few most common
oil benchmarks, which represent
crude oil from different parts of
the globe, including: Brent Crude,
West Texas Intermediate (WTI),
and Dubai/Oman.
The supply and demand of crude
oil, and thus its price have huge im-
plications on the global economy,
affecting not only the daily lives
of individuals, but also industries
ranging from aviation, transporta-
tion, consumer discretionary, con-
sumer staples, and automobiles.
I’m too embarassed to ask:
what are commodities?
