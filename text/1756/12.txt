Art is an interesting aspect of life.
While we consume it every day,
we fail to articulate and define its remit.
And even the boundaries, if any, be-
tween the ill-defined definitions we
provide for say Arts, Music, and Theatre
are ever so blurred in the 21st century.
In another world, in a world without
COVID-19, a busy world that is, we
wouldn’t have had time for such seman-
tics. But in this current expanse of time,
courtesy of the pandemic, the mind
wanders for such introspection.
London is truly blessed in that
accord. A modern-day bridge between
the old world and the new one, both lit-
erally and metaphorically. Tucked away
in its quaint neighbourhoods, museums
in London offer a quick getaway to any
part of world, from full blown head-
liners such as The National Gallery or
British Museum to the quaint personnel
collections of
famous Britons
such as The Wal-
lace Collection or
Apsley House.
Considering
that, I realized
that I was better
placed now, in
diverse London,
than in my earlier
years, to address
this predicament
What is the
definition of Art?
If not a compre-
hensive, articulate
one, at least a per-
sonal one would
do for now. For
the better part
of 2020 while
the COVID-19
situation ravaged
all over, the absence of prolonged local
lockdown meant that you could almost
make up for the lack of international
travel and enjoy these exhibits like
never before, away from the crowds, the
glistening frenzy of Instagrammers and
the constant chatter of tourists. Howev-
er, as England is dragged into a second
lockdown this opportunity is alas taken
away.
Pushing for a last rendezvous and
seeking to resolve my dilemma before
the curtains close, I find myself here
on the 4th of November, a cold grey
London evening in Manchester Square,
standing before the old townhouse
of the Seymour family, now housing
The Wallace Collection. If I am being
honest, I chose this one, half indulging
in an incoherent intuition that if I were
to find any definition/resolution, it was
to be in an old school collection such as
this, and - well - because they were the
only one who had a last-minute ticket
available the day before the lockdown.
Seems like I was not the only Art enthu-
siast in town, but perhaps certainly was
the laziest.
One-way paths, reduced occupan-
cies for each room, hand sanitiser tills
every few yards, and
the works. Noth-
ing changed and yet
everything did. A
little less than half the
collection had been
boarded up, owing to
safety measures, but
enough indeed for its
quarters. I wandered
by all the famous stops,
consciously reflecting
this time on the cause
of any appreciation.
The grand staircase
with its famous
wrought iron balus-
trade, made originally
for the Royal Bank in
Paris in the early 18th
century, stood as ever,
overlooking the en-
trance — It certainly
had allure. But was it
the history, or its inherent beauty or was
it a realisation that it’s a perfect the em-
bodiment of the turbulence of time? I
was not sure. But I stood and I watched.
I followed the trail there on, gazing
and ogling at the umpteen drawers and
cabinets from Louis XV’s court, the
intricate clock pieces with their marble
sculptures, and the paintings by Old
Masters, reflecting another time. The
Venice Canal, busy with activity, paint-
ed by Canaletto in his trademark style
- I wonder if dolphins swam in the canal
in his time? The Laughing Cavalier
by Frans Hals was still smiling nearby,
despite the dearth of tourists wanting a
selfie with him now. Anyway, a pensive
few moments accorded and I moved
onto the European armour collection,
the least interesting to me personally
but it struck a realisation. Most of the
appreciation stemmed from the exhibits
history, albeit as short as it was. Perhaps
that’s the point of these institutions isn’t
it? The contextualization of the creation
of Art? I strayed a bit further, moving
back and forth, savouring all I could,
aware of the lockdown, but I could
never put my finger on what constituted
Art.
Coming out, however, the last thing
that registered in my mind, was that the
definition I was seeking was and is by
itself meaningless. In hindsight, I might
have done myself a disservice by visiting
a collection with a narrow gambit, but
then again, whatever we call it - Art
doesn’t itself articulate, or at least good
Art doesn’t, but it begs articulation and
discourse. So, at the end of the day, it is
what you make of it. The common con-
sensus however must be that it evokes a
thirst, a desire if any to be awed, and in
my opinion anything that satisfies that,
would be the bounds of its definition. It
seems to be the same across platforms,
whether you are in the stands in an op-
era, or before a Bernini or in a humble
drawing room of a 19th century town-
house, looking at Rembrandt.
I sat outside following this line of
thought a bit, watching the staff close
the gates. The relevance of semantics
disappeared further, and a stark reality
emerged as I watched this somber pa-
rade. The reality of the lockdown and
theneededshiftinconsumptionof ‘Arts’
for the next few weeks. I was remind-
ed of Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s verse
from the ‘Rime of the Ancient Mariner’
- ‘Water, water, everywhere, and all the
boards did shrink; Water, water, every-
where, nor any drop to drink’. In that
moment this captured my thoughts per-
fectly well. There stood on the other side
of me, some of the greatest collection of
Arteveraccumulated,availabletoallun-
til just a few minutes ago.
The internet is indeed a cruel thing,
tantalisinguswiththeprospectofreplac-
ing this physical experience ever since.
Memories of the hours spent scouring
the scores of online museum catalogues
during the first lockdown came to mind.
Perhaps it’s time we all give the internet
another try, but when that fails, we shall
find ourselves here again when the cur-
tains and the doors reopen, only at that
time, there isn’t going to be enough wa-
ter for our thirst.
