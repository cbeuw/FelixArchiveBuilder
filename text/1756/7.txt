This week has been the first time that
I have properly felt the despair of
lockdown. In the spring and sum-
mer, when I was revising for exams ,
being stuck at home was helpful. It
allowed me to work harder without
distraction. I was living alone with
my girlfriend and I would get up
in the morning, exercise and work
through the day and then we would
cook together in the evening. Yet our
situation at the times seemed so much
bleaker. We had no idea when our
confinement would end and far less of
a reason to feel optimistic about the
future as we can now thanks BioN-
Tech, Pfizer and Moderna.
I wonder if this is because the end
seems both so near and so far away.
With full immunisation predicted to
still be over 6 months away am I just
facing the realisation that many of my
peers have already been clever enough
to figure out a while ago. Namely, that
things you want to do are no longer
possible and this situation is still long
from finishing.
Alternatively it could be that the
frustration stems from no longer
feeling that the social distancing re-
quirements no longer seem to match
the severity of the problem that the
country is facing.
Neither of these two reasons particu-
larly sits right in my head though.
I am forced to consider whether the
reason that I was more productive in
the March to July period was because
I was being kicked out of bed every
morning and being told to go and
make a cup of tea.
What I need is some sort of machine
that can replicate this function. Some
kind of machine that would only turn
off when the liquid volume of one
mug is poured into it and would re-
activate if I got back into bed. Please
send suggestions to felix@ic.ac.uk
with detailed blueprints or completed
machines to the Union.

The immense joy of seeing
someone you sort of know

Statement
of Intent
We here at Felix believe that it is al-
ways in the interests of the students to
know. That cover-up and paternalistic
obfuscation is never right and that
as intelligent people students should
be treated with respect and given the
ability to make up their own minds.
Therefore, I, the Felix Editor, on be-
half of the team promise that:
We will to the best of our abil-
ity tell you the whole truth and
nothing but the truth.
We will keep your confidence
and will only publish something
you say to us if you have explicitly
said that we can.
We will work to expose unfair-
ness and discrimination in all
forms that it takes both at the
College and elsewhere.
We will treat fairly any article
sent to us, regardless of point
of view and do our best to work
with you to prepare it for publi-
cation it in our pages.

Maybe some sort of pulley
device?
I went onto campus this
week in order to do
something in the Felix
office. My plan was
a quick in and out
visit. Arrive, do what
needed to be be done
and leave. What I never
appreciated is how many
people whose acquaintance
I had made that I would see.
I am an outgoing person. I like to
meet people and talk to them. Yet I
do not think I am alone in saying that
there are a huge number of people
that I know that with whom I have
never spoken. Maybe they are on
my course or I know them through
someone else. In any case my instinct
would once have been to ignore them
or to nod politely and to
walk on by. However,
this time, as I walked
through South Kens-
ington I felt like all
my filters had been
switched off. I was
speaking to everyone.
Anyone whose name I
knew I greeted with huge
excitement delighted at the oppor-
tunity to see anyone.
I wonder what will happen when we
can all move around freely again. I
like to imagine that other people will
experience, the same feeling, at least
for a while. A whole country expe-
riencing immense joy at just seeing
and talking to someone will be lovely,
however, quickly it is over.
