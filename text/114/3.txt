Last Monday tbe P o l i s h Society held
Its Best successful evening yet. Tne
Society was happy te entertain so aany
v i s i t o r s from other colleges - over
two hundred people attended. The even-
lag got o f f to a good s t a r t with a
canoe 'Oberek' by the TJ.L. P o l i s h Soc.
f o l k Dance Group, who l a t e r gave a K S X M
s p i r i t e d performs nee of the 'Kratow-
lak< - a P o l i s h 'Teddy-Boy' dance and
a 'Chlopak Podolski'.
The evening continued with a duet
ay two very attractive>girls and some
piano solos which provided a pleasant
change of mood. A f t e r the i n t e r v a l the
Ssymanowski Choir sang some d e l i g h t f u l
f o l k songs and c a r o l s . The M.C., Mr
T. Wisniewski, deserves s p e c i a l ment-
ion f o r M s wit and informality.
Hiss, Renata Bogdanska, the Radio
sad T .V. star concluded the programme
w i t h four encores from her repertoire
ef P o l i s h , I t a l i a n and E n g l i s h songs,
and the evening ended happily i n a
eoffee bar i n South Kensington.
The motion before the house at
t h i s term's Union Debate was "That
t h i s House has no confidence i n Her
Majesty's Government." Austen Albu
1C.P. and P.Jarman proposed the motion,
and i t was opposed by W.H.Rees- Davies
M.P. and T.C.Smith.
MT Albu, an ex-Guildsman, opened
w i t h a w i t t y indictment of the Gov-
ernment, but pointed out that , since
Her Majesty's advisers had appointed
him a governor of t h i s College, he
wa s i n a rather bad p o s i t i o n i f he
questioned t h e i r judgment. He then
proceeded to a serious condemnation
of Government p o l i c y over the Bent Act
at home and Cyprus abroad.
St Hees-Davies also opened i n
humorous vein with a story of a stu-
dent debate at which he had proposed
that " i t i s possible to have a better
d i r t y weekend i n the Backs at Cam-
bridge than i n Paris." He went on to
PCS. SMOKING CONCERT
At the commencement of this popul-
ar event the Concert H a l l was w e l l
f i l l e d , as also were the glasses -
there being free beer or cider f o r
those who desired i t . The President
of R.C.S., i n h i s capacity as M.C.
declared that he considered the c u l t -
u r a l l e v e l of the Smoking Concert
should be ralsed.On considering the
general c u l t u r a l l e v e l of the various
departmental shows i t i s doubtful
whether anybody else was of the same
opinion.
After a Brownbagger's Declaration,
the R.C.S. S k i f f l e Group appeared. At
f i r s t they were inaudible but improved
as time pa'sed and even c o l l e c t e d some
money. The general f e e l i n g seemed to
be that they overstayed t h e i r welcome,
there being cries of "Enough,enough".
Other features before the i n t e r v a l
were "How a P i l m i s produced" by the
Chemistry department, a c h i l l y - l o o k i n g
sculpture e x h i b i t i o n and a Russian
Science laboratory. H e l l Harrison and
Andy Mathews played stalwart parts l a
lowering the staiwlÂ«rd to rock bottom.
describe the Conservatives as heirs to
the L i b e r a l t r a d i t i o n and maintained
that Government policy i n Kenya and
Central A f r i c a was t r u l y l i b e r a l i n
i t s outlook.
To MT Altai's surprise, Mr Jarman
had no confidence i n the Government or
the opposition. He emphasised his op-
inion that a Liberal government would
be the only desirable one, while Mr
Smith defended Government policy on
the conventional grounds that while
l i v i n g conditions were not perfect,
they might be much worse.
At the conclusion of the paper
speeches, a f u l l House proceeded to
a l i v e l y discussion of the motion;
t h i s continued u n t i l 3:10 p.m. note-
worthy was MT A l l e n , who passionately
advanced the cause of equality of op-
portunity and of g i v i n g help to the
underdeveloped nations. Other views
came from Communists and Liberals, as
w e l l as Conservatives and S o c i a l i s t s ,
although the Conservatives produced a
greater proportion of the voters than
they did of the speakers from the
f l o o r .
The House then divided, the motion
being c a r r i e d by 70 votes to 52 with
14 abstentions. At the opening of the
debate over 200 members were present.
BARDOT AT I.C.
A very successful series of Sat-
urday night hops ended f o r the term
with FELIX'S Birthday Dance (FELIX i s
now eight years o l d ) , The Bruce Gay-
ler band provided the music for the
dancers i n the Concert H a l l , while
the Jazz band played i n the Upper Re-
fectory f o r a short while before the
Interval.
The second year Chemists' comic
opera "The Rake's Progress" received
a great ovation. I t consisted of mim-
ing to current popular tunesj the
synchronisation was perfect. The lead-
ing part was excellently played by Ken
Packer. The succeeding "Restaurant
Scene", also a Chemistry production,
provided Dr. Dennis Evans with an
opportunity to eat a candle, an e l e c t r i c
l i g h t bulb and a drinking glass. As a
f i n a l e he took a mouthful of l i q u i d
oxygen and proceeded to blow i t through
a lighted cigarette with somewhat
speotaoular results.

ENGINEERS DINNER &
DANCE
MAKE A NOTE IN YOUR DIARY NOW
During the i n t e r v a l the Jazz
Band worked through t h e i r repertoire
with Tony Hodgson taking the lead on
his c l a r i n e t .
The second h a l f of tiro concert
started rather slowly with a French
scene played i n and around a cloche-
merle-type equippage.However, a short
r e c i t a t i o n by Amos helped to restore
the c u l t u r a l atmosphere:
" I t gave the family quite a s t a r t .
When Angela became a tart ...."
The Zoology department showed t
t h e i r baseness by g i v i n g t h e i r impress-
ion of I.C, n i g h t l i f e .
The second year Geologists
showed t h e i r great v e r s a t i l i t y .
After s t a r t i n g with dancing g i r l s ,
one of whom had a beard, they con-
tinued with b a l l e t . T h e i r main feat-
ure "This i s your L i f e " was a Summ-
ary of the past l i f e of IvorBottom
played by N e l l Harrison. (Voice from
the audience: " I f that's""what they teach
you i n Geology,God help you").
During the interval a f i l m show
was held i n the ttpper Refectory. With
bated breath, the l.rgc and appreciat-
ive audience followed the fortunes of
F e l i x the oat i n a neo-futuristic drama
of outer space and a sex-laden romance
with Calamity Jane,
Later i n the evening several spot-
dances with a difference were held.
One lucky f e l l o w won a dance with Miss
B r i g i t Bardot, but his joy was short-
l i v e d : no sooner did he stretch out
his hand to her than she turned into
cardboard before hia very eyes. An-
other couple won a large banana, which
they then proceeded to eat, i n the
French fashion (see page 4) while dan-
cing round the -floor. Other prizes
included an i n f l a t a b l e sputnik (by
arrangement with Mike Todd) and two
glasses of FELIX punch to be drunk
straight down. The recipients were
swept up the following morning.
