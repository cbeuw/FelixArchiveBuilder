LA DONNA E MOBILE
" y e l l x meets Calamity Jane" i a
dismissed by some soeptlcs as "just
another cartoon", but beneath i t s num-
erous surface there i s S recurrent
note of gravity.
The eternal mental c o n f l i c t when
"boy meets g i r l " i s portrayed i n car-
toon form. Psychologists hare expres-
sed amassment at the c l a r i t y with which
t h i s Idee f i x e i s presented. There i s
an undertone of f r u s t r a t i o n and d i s -
content throughout the entire f i l m , an
i n d i c a t i o n of the hyperaesthesia to
which the mind of the would-be lover
i s subject.
The f i l m i s a fantasy created by
the love-sick youth and i s an excel-
lent example of what psychologists
term"wlsh fulfilment". The setting i s
immediately romantic: boy meets g i r l
i n d i s t r e s s , g i r l weeping and ugly
(a problem with which the learner-
lover i s not uncommonly confronted
In his dream world he solves the prob-
lem by substituting a dream g i r l .
(This exemplifies the subconscious
compensatory mechanism which attempts
to protect our dreamer from harsh r e a l -
i t y . )
The g i r l i s lonely, unclothed and
defenceless, but i n t h i s i d y l l i c world
our dreamer i s chivalrous Instead of
l i c e n t i o u s . He endures many hardships
to clothe her i n finery, but inevit-
ably he i s spurned by t h i s femme fatale
and i s brought back to the horror of
h i s r e a l world.
RECORDS ~
A recent record I have received
from the Docoke Recording Co. i a an ex-
cellent example " o f jazz chamber mus —
i o . This i s an extended player (45 rpm)
and presents American b a l l a d forms,
enriched rhythmically and melodically
by the Kinsey Sex-tct.
The vibes are played i n a t r u l y e-
thereal manner; the ectoplasm!c v i b r a t -
tions permeate one's innermost being,
even to the very soul. The emotional
balance i s mantained by an extended
rhythmj sequence provided by the drums,
but the contrapuntal technique i s used
a l i t t l e excessively i n the recapitula-
t i o n . This tends to disturb the d e l i -
cate balance between harmony and caco-
phony, and allows the sex-tot to go f o r
ooffee.
(Both sides of the record sound
deoidedly better when played at 33rpm-
— o f f centre).

IN SEARCH OF MODERN JAZZ
Browsing among records has long
been an occupation of mine; I have
meandered through Mozart; I am devo-
ted to Dvorak. Ah, you say, another
c l a s s i c a l slob: but no, bear with me
a l i t t l e longer f r i e n d s .
Being the season of goodwill to
a l l men, and women, I have decided to
forgo my prejudice and go i n search
of Modern Jazz. With a', "poof" to
the pops, and a c a t c a l l to the c l a s s -
i c s , I see "Jazz a-". I fight my
way through an amorphous c o l l e c t i o n
of contortioned, perspiring bodies,
grovelling i n the groovo.
"I am searching for Modern Jazz"
I say to the 38-22-35 (* lCfS - expe-
rimental error-1
behind the counter.
Noting my obvious rectangular shape
she produces a '45', and thrusts me
into a cubical. To a background of
s k i f f l e , and "Rock and H o l l " , I l i s -
ten to my f i r s t modern jazz.
I t r y to detect a tappable rhythm
— — t h e r e i s none, so I invent one. The
imaginary rhythmgrips me, my movement
becomes e r r a t i c : feet and arms f l y i n
carefree abandon, clothes f a l l from me,
but I am t r i u m p h a n t — I have achieved
my aim. However, at the moment of ecs-
tasy I am deflated, a dozen Txmray
Stxxlxs are watching my antics with
great interest. Pausing only to dress,
I f l e e from the jeering, j i v i n g crowd.
That was many discs ago; now I am
an ardent modernist, no longer trying
to oontort myself to non-existent rhythm
but content to l i s t e n reverently to i t s
awe-inspiring polyphony.
R.O.T.
Our musical correspondent writes:-'
Perhaps a few words on the develop
ment of modern jazz would be relevant
here, f o r the uninitiated.
I t s development t h i s century car
be summarised i n the words of a d i s -
tinguished musie c r i t i o : " I t shows a
gradual change from homogeneity to he-
terogeneity, of increasing elaboration
and deviation from the essential purity
of c l a s s i c a l style."
J. S. Bark i n h i s book "That P r i -
mitive Downbeat" (Heinz AHeinz '57) ex-
presses i t d i f f e r e n t l y ; he says of mod-
ern jazz:"It's a l l done by mirrors".
The esote Co significance of mode-
rn jazz must never be underestimated,
when analytical considerations are para-
mount. With t h i s i n mind we oan attempt
to comprehend the a r t i s t r y of the moder-
n i s t .
Traditional jazz i s conceived by
some to be a stabilised,even an objective
form of musical expression. Modern jazz,
on the other hand, i s i n an eternal
transitory state:- a crashing coda of
t i n k l i n g timpanioan be transformed spon-
taneously, into an alert allegro. There
i s no r i g i d mould into which t h i s jazz
can be poured; on the contsary, a very
high degree of e l a s t i c i t y , an i n f i n i t e
stretching i n almost any direction,is
considered quite legitimate.
BOOKS ~
EXTRUDED CAMBRIDGE DICTIONARY
dictionary, n. Book dealing, usu.
i n alphabetical order, with the words
of a language or of some special sub-
j e c t , author, etc., wordbook, lexicon.
This i a an extraordinary bosk. I t
reminds as ef a lunatic I know who, on
returning the L-H volume of the London
Telephone Directory to h i s l o c a l l i b -
rary, remarked:"tne plot's lousy, but
eh bcyt what a east*.' This book, l i k e -
wise, has a lousy plot; i t i s saved
f r o a becoming tedious by the author's
astonishing vocabulary.
I aa not too happy about the
author's arrangement of Ideas. Hav-
ing ease defined the order of things
he is content to let Batters slide,
sad one knows what the end will he
long before i t Is in fact reached. BO
has, however, shewn a spark of ingen-
uity by taking a leaf out of Dante's
"Inferno": in the middle of his seek
he found himselfin L, but aanaged to
escape by means of a highly ingenious
contrivance known as M. Although near-
ly overwhelmed In a sudden deluge
while passing from 0 to C, he conclud-
ed in a masterly fasMosPwith U s I
l a the clouds.
The great advantage of this book
i s that i t i s 3§ inches thick, I hare
used i t f o r several years to keep the
safety-valve of ay apparatus closed,
and have found i t second only to the
Bible i n t h i s respect.
P.S. I have also found the E.C J).
very useful f o r looking words up i n .
I f sore people did t h i s , we might get
some better reviews In PELTS.
but everybody reads
