the tt.S.C. and the Treasury; i t i s
expected that b a t t l e w i l l be joined
about Christmas. In closing, the
Sector stressed that the present plans
are not i n t h e i r f i n a l form - they are
only the plans i n the form that they
have been submitted f o r approval. I t
had been suggested that they should
have been made public before, but he
asked how t h i s could have been done as
the plans had only just been published,
Richard Sheppard was absolutely
prioeless, and he kept h i s audience
amused the whole"time. The l a s t occ-
asion on whioh he had had to speak was
when he was t r y i n g t o convince h i s
o l i e n t s of the s u i t a b i l i t y of h i s plans
for building some oow-house3. These
were high class establishments, and the
economic rent f o r a cow was £5-10s.
The plans included a laboratory f o r a r t -
i o i a l insemination; he f e l t that t h i s
would i n no way s a t i s f y students, and
assured us that we would i n fact get
the best that oould be provided.
STOCKHOLM . . .
These introductory remarks were
followed up by a seleotion of colour
s l i d e s *ef student Hall3 of Residence
in other parts of Europe. Deserving
p a r t i c u l a r mention are the Domus i n
Stockholm, the restaraunt of which i s
advertised by a large neon sign, which
also serves to guide students homewards
on dark nights! We may very w e l l
get one ourselves. The idea of l e t - *
t i n g rooms i n summer to v i s i t o r s from
overseas seems t o be s t i l l .a d i s t i n c t
p o s s i b i l i t y as by that means a much
better return on o a p i t a l could be ob-
tained, and t h i s would please the Trea-
sury. In Sweden students spend seven
years i n college, and i t has been found
necessary i n Stockholm to b u i l d an en-
ormous blook o f f l a t s f o r married stud-
ents. In fact, I t seems that on go-
ing up to College as single students,
men put t h e i r names on the waiting l i s t
for f l a t s , so that when they are ready
for one they w i l l be able to get one
easily. Eaoh of these f l a t s has a
small kitohenette and a private bath-
room. A s l i d e of a t y p i c a l room,
whioh had i t s own private shower and
washbasin, together wi;th ample olathing
cupboards and book space was also shown.
. . . ASD PARIS
Sgmont i n Copenhagen i s run as an
hotel i n summer, and t h i s i s found t o
be a worthwhile proposition. The
s t a f f s i t u a t i o n i s solvsd by employing
students as waitresses and porterS|
thsy get tho necessary t r a i n i n g i n a
special oourse l a s t i n g about a week or
ten days. This H a l l was eight stories
high, had l i f t s t o a l l f l o o r s , and i n -
cluded dining rooms and s i m i l a r commu-
n i t y f a c i l i t i e s . Another University
that had bsen v i s i t s d by Messrs. Shep-
pard and Sparkes was the C i t e Univera-
i t a i r e i n Paris. 0ns o f t h e i r Halls
of Residence three stories high, was
an extremely elegant design by Le Cor-
busier. Another eight s t o r i e s high
and housing 2000 students was just ths
opposite i n design. A long, massive
and uninteresting b u i l d i n g , . i t s facade
was broken up by baloonies and other
f r i l l s . The hostel was f o r both sen
and women students, a l l allegedly l i v i
ing i n single rooms. The ssxes were
not segregated i n t o d i f f e r nt areas but
were randomly scattered through the bu-
i l d i n g . The whole b u i l d i n g had an
atmosphere that was, t o quote Mr Shep-
pard 'quite indescribable and most i n t -
eresting. ' The French were very r e t -
ioent on the subject but one oould draw
one's own conclusions from the number
of couples that ate together at lunch
time, together with t h e i r children i n
many cases, and from the large creohe
and nursery that was provided as one of
the f a c i l i t i e s of the H a l l . The Cite
U n i v e r s i t a i r e was an enormous project
and even had i t s own s t a t i o n on the
Metro. The dating f a c i l i t i e s , however"
caused the largest amount o f eye opening.
It was to be hoped, Mr. Sheppard f e l t , "
that I.C. should never sink t o the
depth that t h i s refectory reached. On
coming i n with the g i r l f r i e n d and baby
one i s served oafeteria-wise, stainless
s t e e l tray-plates being used which have
depressions f o r soup, meat course, sweet
r o l l s and butter, etc. They served
3000 lunches an hour i n one large room
and, as oould e a s i l y be imagined, the
noise was indescribable. He had ob-
served one couple eating a banana i n a
most curious fashion, s t a r t i n g one a t
eaoh end, and working inwards u n t i l they
i n the middle. (The banana was shown
.OB one of the s l i d e s . ) Two of the
main items on the menu which cropped
up very regularly were steak and chic-
ken.
a s innSL OF WBESM HALL
(from the Planning Office exhibition)
Mr. Richard Sheppard now spoke at
greater length about the Prince's Gar-
dens projeot. L i f t s would, he said,
be i n s t a l l e d i n a l l Halls, together
with common room f a c i l i t i e s and refec-
t o r i e s . The e x i s t i n g Garden would be
retained, and would be mainly f o r the
use of residents. This would be the
f i r s t London square which had been r e -
b u i l t as a homogeneous unity. Most o f
the oommunal f a c i l i t i e s w i l l be s i t u a t -
ed i n the south blook. A oertain num-
ber o f shoos w i l l be incorporated, inc-
luding a barber's shop. Dining Halls
would be b u i l t i n small units so that
noise levels can be kept down to t o l e -
rable l i m i t s ; associated with t i e n wo
would be bar and buttery. These, to-
gether with co-u i t t e e , music and dark
rooms would be situated on the Lower
(mews) l e v e l . Car parks would bs s i t -
uated at the rear of the Bast block,
and i t was hoped that a cycle repair
shed might be possible. The road on
the Bast side of the s iu ire would be
d o s e d to vehicular t r a f f i c and that is)
ths south side would become purely an
access road to tns oar parks and the
South blook. The North-side road would
however have to remain, as i t provides
access to Enniamore Gardens. The
change i n the roads had, he said, a l -
ready been approved by the L.C.C.
QTBSfI0B" TIME
'As f. r e s u l t of t h e i r travels rou-
nd Europe, Messrs Sheppard and Sparkes
had come to the conclusion that rooms
should have a f l o o r area of between
120 and 150 sq. f t . The present plans
were based on an area of 140 f t . super
which i s the minimum area recommended
by the M i n i s t r y of Eduoation: however
the U.G.C. seem t o think otherwise and
are t r y i n g to cut us down t o 120 sq. f t
The architects next worked out what f u -
rniture was required, and could be f i t -
ted i n conveniently. As a result o f
experimenting with numerous small models
they had qome t o the conolusion that
room dimensions of about 14ft. by 10ft
was about the most suitable as i t gave
the most economical arrangement of
space. The furnishings had been under
close investigation owing to the excep-
t i o n a l standard of strength that i s r e -
quired f o r student-type furniture. I t
had been found that a r t i o l e s manufact-
ured to B r i t i s h Standard Specifications
were not nearly strong enough, and that
much more r i g i d specs, were necessary.
They had decided, that put-you-up type
beds were wholely unsuitable; because
a f t e r four years' use i n other hostels
— they were v i r t u a l l y worn out. Divan
beds w i l l probably be provided.
SPORTS CLUB
It i s planned eventually t o i n c -
orporate a sports club i n the North
side buildings. This would includs
squash courts etc. The Swimming Fool
o r i g i n a l l y planned would not be b u i l t
immediately but would be deferred t o
some date i n the future, being i n c l u -
ded i n some other scheme as and when
the money became available.
HOTEL T PERHAPS
It has not been deoided whether or
not the buildings w i l l be used by sum-
mer v i s i t o r s . L i f t f a c i l i t i e s w i l l be
provided to the l s t . 5th. and 9th. f l o -
ors only. Access to other f l o o r s w i l l
be by stairoase. As f a r as v i s i t o r s
were concerned they would i n a l l prob-
a b i l i t y net l i k e the idea of having t o
walk up to t h e i r rooms, but as Mr.
Sheppard pointed out, they oan always
take the l i f t to a higher f l o o r and
wait down.
WBBI T
It i s hoped that the f i r s t stage
of t h i s scheme w i l l be completed by
1960, with the p o s s i b i l i t y o f seeks
Hall being completed e a r l i e r ; t h i s
includes the East and South sides of
tho square i f the U.G.C. gives the go-
ahead and provides tha necessary mon-
ey. Week s H a l l would go on no mat-
ter what else happened, as the money
was ready and waiting to he used.
At this point a l l further questio-
ning was stopped as ths meeting was
Brought to an abrupt olose on ths pre-
text of being 2-.3) p.m. and time for
lectures. This is rather to be depl-
ored as i t cut out what was developing
int a vary interesting question and
answer session. It is a pity that
more time oould not have been kept free
for the inevitable questions.
