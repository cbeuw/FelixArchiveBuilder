able t o earn good money, keep I t and
keep i t good. To t h i s end Liberals
suggest Government help to enterprising
people who wish to s t a r t business i n
industry and agriculture; the grant-
ing of generous loans f o r house and
farm purchase; the encouragement o f
profit-sharing and oo-ownership i n i n -
dustry, by the removal of tax obstaoles
to them; and a general reduction i n
taxation. A f a l l i n the oost of l i v -
ing and a phenomenal r i s e i n production
would be apparent i n a matter of months.
But what about the less fortunate
individuals, i n d i f f i c u l t i e s through no
f a u l t of t h e i r own? This i s where the
S o c i a l Services, originated by Liberals
before the 1914-18 war, come into play.
They were intended to help people to
help themselves - pensions and subsi-
dies are required f o r the unlucky, i n -
jured, o l d and sick, not f o r everyone
regardless of means. I t i s ridiculouf
to subsidise uneconomic projects indef-
i n i t e l y i n peacetime; instead the mon-
ey should be invested i n c a p i t a l equi-
pment f o r the Industries our i s l a n d can
cope with.
TO bring about these changes with-
out s t r i f e or hardship we must c o n t i -
nue t o improve basic Education and ex-
tend Education i n technology, indust-
r i a l management and Trade Union pro-
cedure as much as possible. We must
also provide temporary higher unemploy-
ment pay t o help people to t r a i n f o r
fresh jobs and even move house i n the
t r a n s i t o r y stage.
Liberals believe i n freedom f o r
the i n d i v i d u a l above a l l . A person
should be able t o work, worship, save,
spend and generally l i v e as he wishes,
not as bureaucrats c a l l e d the State
demand. Therefore the freedom of
individuals must be guaranteed by a .
proper balance between t h e i r rights
and the claims of Government and Looal
Authorities; i t i s Parliament's res-
p o n s i b i l i t y but Parliament at present
r e f l e c t s group interests above the com-
mon interest, is- handioapped by an out-
dated committee system and i s neither
r e l i e v e d of much work nor f a i r l y advi-
sed by an ever onorsided House of Lords.
Some degree of Parliamentary reform and
the granting of more r e s p o n s i b i l i t y to
Local Authorities i n certain fields, so
as to bring more ordinary oitisens into
Local Government,would be worthwhile.
F i n a l l y , individuals need much stronger
legal protection against the tyranny of
employers, Trade Unions or Trade Asso-
ciations. This, i n c i d e n t a l l y , would
be another advance i n the direction of
partnership between a l l employers and
employees.
Simultaneously B r i t a i n must pursue
a r e a l i s t i c course i n foreign a f f a i r s
and remember that people of a l l nations
have the same rights t o freedom. M i l -
i t a r y and economic force and c o l o n i a l -
ism lead to chaos when Imposed upon
anyone, but honest trade and co-oper-
ation y i e l d peace and prosperity.There-
fore Liberals say j o i n i n the Free
Trade Area, Buratom and the Schuman
plan with enthusiasm and, from exper-
ience, lead them to success; seek
f r e e r trade throughout the world; work
for international treaties to guarantee
free aocess t o v i t a l raw materials
sueh as o i l ; and co-operate with the
Commonwealth and N.A.T.O. i n defence.
Most important of a l l Liberals believe
i n seeking peace by negotiation, f i r s t
with the Commonwealth, Europe and the
U.S.A. and then with the Communist cou-
ntries. The U.N.O. i s the medium f o r
t h i s and i t w i l l f a i l i f i t i s not used
and i t s decisions are not adhered to:
i t i s the duty of each one of us to
serve, d i r e c t l y and i n d i r e c t l y , a l l
INTERNATIONAL organisations and causes
well.

THE
SUGGESTIONS
BOOK
REVIEWED
When Mr. Briggs f i r s t produced i t
i n October t h i s year, t h i s volume was
immediately recognised as indispens-
able to the I.C. student. In h i s
foreword Mr. Briggs relates how, on
returning from strenuous a c t i v i t y
in the gym, he was frustrated i n h i s
attempts to buy soup and milk; with
ths money he thus saved the book was
brought into being.and christened
with a stream of pent-up complaints
and the odd pent-up suggestion. I n
more serious vein Mr. Briggs explains
to us how i n f l a t i o n h i t s the student
twice overj prices go up, parents
income goes up and grants come down!
A large part of the book deals
with the complaints and partlculary
interesting i s the chapter on peas.
Mr. Mooney*s peas have been variously
described as lead shot, green
b u l l e t s and indigestible b a l l bearings,
but a l l contributors agree that they
show l i t t l e resemblance other than i n
size and shape to the natural product.
As they are quite inedible this form
of f i s h and chip decoration i s a
luxury we oan do without. One cont-
ributor asked, i n rather bad taste,
whether they were i n fact made from
r e a l peas or from some synthetic
formula f o r which I.C.R. holds the
patent. The Catering Sub-Committee
remained ominously s i l e n t on t h i s
matter, but i t pointed out -that garden
peas would increase the cost of a dish
by 3d. I t i s pleasing to note
though that evidence of the l a s t few
weeks indicates that a compromise has
been reached, and the peas, i f not
t a s t i n g of the genuine a r t i c l e , are
at least edible.
Also interesting i s the chapter
on dessert spoons, which hostel
dwellers f i n d to be excellent dual-
purpose instruments also suitable
for soup. In contrast, patrons of
the lower refectory object te using
soup spoons f o r eating t h a i r Bakewell

The author of these remarks was t o l d

largely educative i n nature and i t
appears that FELIX has reached the J
status of a learned journal, readers
twioe being referred to FELIX (Issue
113 p . l . c o l . l . ) . Also the eating habits
of domestic animals do not interest the
Catering Sub-Committee and correspond-
ence on such matters should be sent
to the I d i t o r of FELIX. In which
case would that gentleman care to note
that on 18th. Oct. 1957 a woodlouse

Sub-Committee claim they are attempting

to be i n some doubt as to whom they sre

Perhaps as typical of the ssotion
dealing with ths complaints we may
quote:-
"The white of an egg was rubbery,
the yolk more so. The. peas were
hard except where they had corns
into contact with the egg which they
had dyed an unnatural shade of green.
The chips were leathery and the whole
