a u B Review? T H E CHRISTMAS ISLANDER
TE, the inLawitants of the t h i r d
Christmas Island set amongst the c o r a l
reef of the new aeronautics Building,
r e j o i c e because our season i s close
upon us. I t i s the season of Santa
Claus and cur long l o s t r e l a t i v e s , of
hurried buying at Marks and Spencers
and pound catching with the Post O f f i c e
but i t i s also the time when we Island-
ers, l i k e shipwrecked mariners from
the seas of science, can escape f o r a
f u l l three weeks to the palm trees and
golden sands of our i s l a n d . Upon
t h i s cradle of t r u t h and l i g h t , our
minds oan muse upon the b e a u t i f u l , the
pleasing, and the mysterious as we have
done f o r a l l too 8hort periods i n the
shadows o f the a l l too r e a l Imperial
Oollege.
AS I.C. MEN
As one gases round the quad, with
i t s t r u l y distinguished surroundings,
a dismal sight greets one's eyes.
People rushing to and f r o , mainly men
c l a d , sad to r e l a t e , i n anything from
b o i l e r suits to f i l t h y o l d sports Jac-
kets. Perhaps one can excuse the b o i l -
er suits with a Carnival at hand;
some-one has to work. But who could
excuse those baggy trousers which have
probably never seen a press - that
f i l t h y s h i r t that remains concealed
f o r days on end underneath the ever-
present sweater. A frequent cry heard
i n I.C. i s "More women, more women",
but who could possibly expect to a t -
t r a c t a woman i n that state. I can
only suggest that Education Authorit-
ies increase t h e i r grants to cover
such minor d e t a i l s as hair-cuts.
Another remark frequently heard i s
" I f I l i v e d In the Hostel I could wear
any o l d clothes; i t i s only because I
t r a v e l that I put on my clean s h i r t
occasionally.'' (This i s an authentic
quotation). This rather suggests that
to l i v e i n the hostel induces one to
assume a state of extreme f i l t h and
untidiness, but i n f a c t the standard
Is p r a c t i c a l l y the same i n or out of
h o s t e l . One could excuse casual clothes
i f they were kept clean, but t h i s i s
f a r from the case.
Another sad thought comes to mind
when one considers the very respectable
a t t i r e seen at a b a l l or dinner. I can
honestly say that quite a large per*
eentage of these people are absolutely
unrecognisable when not wearing t h e i r
usual clothes. Perhaps the o l d saying
that evening dress "does things to a
man" i s only too true.
To conclude: since the occasional
wash Is obviously unpopular, I can
only recommend that undergraduate gowns
should be introduced - they are excel-
lent dust covers.

Dr.'a a l l an and Blaokaan have v i s -
i t e d Christmas Island t h i s term t o chat
about V i c t o r i a n n a t i o n a l i s t s and Oanse
and Chance. These gathering* f i l l e d
the Physics l i b r a r y whioh was disguised
•as the beloved island; other gath-
erings, jibbed and jabbed at the I s l a n -
ders' own prose and poetry and also
had a taste o f a Tchekov or two. A
p a r t i c u l a r l y vague paper was read by
an Islander on Twentieth Century Oa-
scurantismand the t h i r d Christmas I s -
land w i l l be f i n a l l y submerged f a r 195?
with the Touchstone Secretary, Mr.C.K,
MoDowali, speaking on ' A Penny f o r the
Old School' - a defence of c l a s s i c a l
education and l i t e r a t u r e . This w i l l
be at 5.45p.m. on Tuesday December 10th,
In the Committee Boom o f f the lower
Union lounge.
A veteran Islander,
David E.H. Jones, i s experimentally t o
exhibit h i s experimental cartoon films
at 5.15p.m. the previous day i n the
same room. Prospective Islanders are
assured of a genial welcome at these or
any other of the Island gatherings.
As you eat your turkey bone, think
of us Islanders basking i n the Winter
sunshine of the Christmas Island; we
s h a l l i n o t think of you u n t i l the dread-
ed Januarv 7th.

MINES BALL
I n ay opinion, as an outsider but
% frequent v i s i t o r to College B a l l s
vrer the past four years, t h i s year's
Mines' B a l l was an unqualified suc-
cess.
Tha novel idea of having the bar
on the stage and the orchestra on the
side of the f l o o r had the e f f e c t of
breaking up the box-like appearance
of the Concert H a l l , and imparting a
f e e l i n g of u n i t y that has generally
been l a c k i n g at College B a l l s . Prom
the bar i t was possible to watch the
dancers and j o i n i n when moved by the
s p i r i t .
There was ample seating i n the
H a l l and the Bar, so that the fun of
the B a l l could s t i l l be enjoyed while
r e s t i n g . A t t r a c t i v e decorations, a
good orchestra and a general f e e l i n g
of c o n v i v i a l i t y n i l went to make the
B a l l the success i t undoubtably was.
May there be more l i k e i t .

FAME
The December issue of MDTCB SPOBT
includes a photograph of Jezebel cros-
s i n g the f i n i s h i n g l i n e at the end of
the Brighton Bun. Tha owners of the
Dennis f i r e engine are asked to write
i n and give various technical d e t a i l s ,
such as the p e t r o l consumption. Bo.,
however, didn't get a mention.

Sam* v i t a l statistics have recently
seen uncovered: "Sabrina was formed
in eight days on San Miguel." The
Sabrina in question waa a volcano
whioh erupted in 1811.
Whilst waiting in the interminable
lunch queue Helson overheard tha
following, "I've had a year's Biology
with her last year", this is food for
thought.
FELIX public Services are pleased to
announce the recent publication of
Volume One of a TEXTBOOK 07 HEEWIHQ*
by I. Jean de Clerok, professor of
the Uhiveraite Catholique de Louvaln.
Why can't we get Professors like this?
"Engineers & S c i e n t i s t s come aai here
'Miss Joan Viokers, M.P. ..."; thus
ran pamphlets, p r i n t e d by the Central
Office of thebConservative Party,
which were d i s t r i b u t e d around the Un-
ion (against Union r u l e s ) . And yet
people complain about FELIX.
It i s reported that a f t e r the FELIX
hop, B r i g i t Bardot waa found f l a t on
her b*<5k i n Warden Irving's room. We
thought that women were not allowed
to spend tha night i n the Hostel.
Heard backstage at the B.C.S, Smo-
king Concert, Mr Green remarking to
Miss Wallace: "Young lady, w i l l you
get into the bath w i t h me?" And

lace are at the moment on t h e i r way to
Germany, where they are going to attend
the Feast of Saint Barbara, who l a sup-
posed to be the Patron Saint of Mining,
at the Clausthai School of Mines.
They were not quite sure what t o

that i t i s a formal a f f a i r , attended
by about 1500 people, among other
things, Jock w i l l be expected to make
a speech ( i n German, of course). He
and Brian w i l l be leaving f o r home on
Sunday.
(JOCK i s not Brian'B brother, and
neither i s Sheenagh.)
As the Bra. said to the Top Hat:
"You go on ahead, I ' l l give these two
a l i f t . "
