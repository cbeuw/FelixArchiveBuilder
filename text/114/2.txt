2 FELIX
GUILDS CARNIVAL
"SPORT, SPORT, G/RLS WE WANT SPORT'
T U s , the opening number of the cabar-
et, w i l l give come idea to those un-
fortunate people not present of the
goings on at the Carnival. A Carnival
i s what yon make i t , and i t appears,
that everyone came with a one-track
mind - er - t o l e t themselves go'.
The majority of the r e v e l l e r s were
i n fanoy dress - a very welcome change,
sue no doubt t o the Ancient Greek
choice of theme. Sheet togas were by
far the most popular dress, a l b e i t
leaving portions of the anatomy expos-
ed t o the occasional beer storm and
passing breese. Some of the females
sported a quite eye-catching lack of
dress.
The cabaret, under the circumstan-
ces, was excellent; the circumstansss
being, of course, that the cast was
b l i n d drunk. The 'dramatis psrsonae*
were a l l outstanding, especially "Ivy",
a g i r l f r i e n d o f Mr Hobson. Any i n h i b -
i t i o n s due t o stage f r i g h t disappeared
as quickly as Ivy's dress (she was
also wearing a b i k i n i , we hasten t o
add). Mr Hewson, a very smooths type,
compered e f f e c t i v e l y from a bath and
demonstrated with Ivy's help the ins
and outs of Pythagoras. The l i d was
taken o f f I.C. l i f e , and the appear-
ance of Prank, our dearly beloved War-
den, on a t y p i c a l hostel bedroom scene
was greeted enthusiastically. A down
and out band of dilapidated Grecian
street musicians, Mr Chadwick (looking
d e l i g h t f u l i n a knee-length toga) on
the euphonium; Mr Stevens on the trump-
et; and Mr Gorb on the drachma-whistle.
The show terminated i n a lusty (and
l u s t i s the operative word on t h i s oc-
casion) Boomal&ka.
Although the bands were playing
u n t i l 5:50 a.m. not many dancers were
l e f t a t that hour â€¢
- quite amazing where
bodies get to'. Mr Gorb found a few i n
the snoggery at 7:00, and the lounges
were p o s i t i v e l y l i t t e r e d with them. I .
have i t on good authority that the jazz
band e f f e c t i v e l y prevented Q.A. from
sleeping that night (do Q.A. sleep at
night?).
A l l i n a l l , a very successful Car-
n i v a l ; c e r t a i n l y most of the maidens
seemed to be s a t i s f i e d .
DEBATING TOURNAMENT SUCCESS
I.C. were drawn against Royal Free
Hospital School of Medicine i n the
f i r s t round of the U.L.U. debating t o u r -
nament.. The debate was, held as one
of the popular lunch time debates a t
which over 100 members were present
i n the house. At lunch, the chair-
man of the judges, Miss Ruth Lloyd,
produced three sealed envelopes whioh
contained d i f f e r e n t motions. Royal
Free won the toss and decided to oppose,
so Mr. Peter Kassler, President of the
L i t . and Deb. Soc., was l e f t t o select
an envelope which contained, the motion:
"This house prefers a knave t o a foolJ
The two teams were then taken to the
Geology Dept. where they were allowed
f i f t e e n minutes to digest t h e i r meal
and to prepare t h e i r speeches.
At 1.20 p.m. the debate was opened
i n the Geology I^oture Theatre by Mr.
D.E.H. Jones who took the chair as Mr.
Kassler was p a r t i c i p a t i n g as a member
of the team. Mr. Les Allen.who l e d
\he I.C. team,opened the proposition
with a famous quotation admirably s u i t -
ed to the motion: "Mary had a l i t t l e
lamb. . ." He then followed t h i s superb
verse by attacking statesmen and p o l i t -
i c i a n s and l i s t i n g them a l l , save Mr.
G o i t s k e l l , as either fools or knaves!
The opposition from Royal Free pointed
out the harmlessness of fools as found
i n undergraduate l i f e compared to tha
knavery o f criminals. Mr. Terry Smith
seconding the proposition dealt with
the p o s s i b i l i t y of reform of knaves by
treatment and kindness while fools
could not be corrected even with the
drastic measure of a leucotomy.s
The attack f o r the proposition was
continued fror? the f l o o r by Mr. Peter
Kassler and Mr. Bob Fiiich. Mr. Kass-
ler'3 f l a t t e r y t o the charming chair-
man of judges, Miss Ruth Lloyd,did
much t o show that chivalry and debat-
ing t r i c k s are f a r from dead at I.C.
Mr Finch reminded the house of the wis-
dom of the "Knave of Hearts" i n s t e a l -
ing patisserie. The opposition, apart
from some goonery i n an attempt to make
the house sympathise with fools, found
themselves s l i g h t l y l o s t with the mo-
tion. At one point one of the speakers
was so perplexed that he proceeded to
t i e a knot i n a shoe lace.
In a b r i l l i a n t summing up, Mr.
Les A l l e n proceeded to p u l l to pieces
the speeches from the opposition un-
t i l i t appeared that t h e i r case was
quite false. At the d i v i s i o n which
followed the motion was carried by 106
votes t o 10. The three judges, Miss
Lloyd, Mr". Peter Jarman (I.C.) and one
from the R.F.H. unanimously awarded
v i c t o r y t o I.C,

DRAM. SOC.
IN PLAY FESTIVAL
The I.C. Dramatic Society was f o r -
tunate t o gain t h i r d place i n the
University One Act Play F e s t i v a l held
l a s t week ax U.L.U. The play, Perci-
val Wilde's "Comrades i n Arms" was a
happy choice i n that i s an amusing,
i f a t times obvloKB, comedy giving
good scope f o r acting a b i l i t y . I t
makes the most of the situation: a
gallants young colonel of the Tala-
verian army t r i e s to win the love of
a major's widow, Elena, whom he has
vatched through the window with the
aid of powerful f i e l d - g l a s s e s , by
pretending to have been the late ma-
jor' s closest f r i e n d , with him when be
died gloriously on the f i e l d of b a t t l e .
The discovery that the major died
while drunk and that the picture on
the w a l l i s not of the major but of
his father does not deter the c o l -
onel i n the least. Unfortunately,
f u l l use was not made of the s i t u a t -
ion i n the production. The set, though
somewhat peculiar, achieved a f a i r
measure of success, p a r t l y due t o the
contrast to the unimaginative use of
the stage by the other companies.
From h i s amusing entrance, Derry
Wright as the colonel brought the play
to l i f e with h i s good sense of timing
and oontrol of voice and movement. The
two women, Elena and her maid, were
rather weaker, but w i l l make good act-
resses under tighter production and
when they have gained more experience,
Peter Morgan gave a competent perfor-
mance as a t r u e - t o - l i f e photographer
As was sadly evident at this Fest-
i v a l as a whole, more thought must be
given to production, especially i n de-
t a i l s of action and In the development
of plot and character. However, i t was
an interesting evening and Terry
Wright must be congratulated on giving
one of i t s best performances,
