PRINCE'S GARDENS
President Chadwick was i n the ohair
at the College Meeting held recently at
which the Rector and the Architect d i s -
closed provisional plans for jwcw r e s i -
d e n t i a l accommodation i n Prince's Gar-
dens. I t was the Rector,without whose
foresight there would have "been no new
r e s i d e n t i a l plans being made at oresent,
and Sichard Sheppard,the architect,
whose foresight and imagination had
been widely acclaimed, who deserve the
highest praise. Dr. Sparkes was also
welcomed to the oompleted Union b u i l -
ding, and i t was to be hoped that he
would never again have to face a r e s t -
ive crowd of students, as when he had
had the unenviable task of explaining
why the Union was not f i n i s h e d on time.
He f e l t the importance of the meeting
could not be overestimated, and remin-
ded everyone of the serious problem of
hostels i n London.
DEVELOPMENT
Dr. Linstead said that Prince's_
Gardens would be one of the finest res-
i d e n t i a l developments i n the country,
and that i f i t were n o t . i t would not be
for lack of trying. He b r i e f l y summ-
arized the history of I.C. hostels.
The Old Hostel was b u i l t i n 1926, and
the New Hostel followed shortly a f t e r -
wards. The p o l i c y had always been
that Hostels were desirable, and that
they whould be situated somewhere near
the South Kensington s i t e . Much l a t e r
S e l k i r k H a l l was opened.
At the beginning of 1955 approxi-
mately 100 were l i v i n g at South Kensing-
ton, and i n the o r i g i n a l development
plan Residential Accommodation had bee;;
plaoed second to academic... However when
he, Dr. Linstead, was appointed Rector,
he thought that the two should have
equal importance. At this stage there
were two plans under consideration:
1) Raise B e i t Quadrangle into a Union
and Hostel only, and have minor devel-
opments elsewhere.
2) Develop the whole of the Beit B u i l -
ding to the f u l l e s t extent, leaving the
Botany departments as they are, and
then have a large development elsewhere.
The governors were i n f u l l agreement
with the Bcasor and when the Univer-
s i t y Grants Comnittee v i s i t e d I.C. a t
the end of 1955" the deplorable state of
our r e s i d e n t i a l accommodation was w i l l
rubbed in. U.G-.C. was shaken, and
very'soon agreed i n p r i n c i p l e to the
scheme. A search now began for a
suitable s i t e ; by an interposition of
providence Prince's Gardens came into
the market at almost the same time
and i t was picked up l i k e a ripe apple.
U.G.C. managed to get the money out of
the Treasury and the s i t e was bought i n
1956. The idea than came that i n
drawing up the plans they might as w e l l
do the job on a proper scale and not
muck about.

R.SM AT B E D F O R D M E E T I N G
A c e r t a i n handsome mining geologist has been elected "Beau of Bedford" f o r the
session 1957-58, â€¢ Last week he was invited to lunch at Bedford College and be pre-
sented with h i s prize at their Union Meeting immediately afterwards. Because 0f a
shyness and modesty becoming to such a man, the "Beau" was allowed to i n v i t e a few
friends to the Meeting to provide moral support while, i n addition, P.W.G.W., a
Prominent Mining man, accompanied the
GUILDS CARNIVAL
"Beau" to the luncheon for
reason (presumably).

IOOO IN RESIDENCE
The number of students
l i v i n g an digs i s steadily r i s i n g ,
there now being 61"' as opposed to 42
a f t e r the war; there i s thus a stead-
i l y increasing amount of suitable
Hostel fodder. The Governors aimed
to have 1000 i n residence f i n a l l y , and
500 d e f i n i t e l y by the end of the quin-
quennium. This was t h e i r minimum aim,
and they would t r y to exceed i t i f
that were at a l l possible. By the end
of 19^6 plans had been provisionally
agreed upon by the L.C.C. and TJ.G.C,
thus by a concatenation of circumstances
much had been achieved.
The question next arose of the
type of Halls of Residence required:
after much thought i t was decided to
keep the s o c i a l l i f e of the College i n
the Union, and to plan the Halls for
study bedrooms only, together with
s u f f i c i e n t eating f a c i l i t i e s to serve
the residents.
PLANS APPROVED
The present position was that no
matter what the Treasury said, we would
be getting at least Week's H a l l , with
70 more rooms, which ..ould be very wel-
come. Demolition on the East and
South sides of the square and on the
s i t e of Week's H a l l would be starting
i n January, followed as soon as pos-
s i b l e by the actual building. The
plans as they stand at the moment have
been commended by the Royal Pine Arts
Commission, which i n i t s e l f i a no mean
achievement, and have been approved by
the L.Q.C. The plans are now before
continued on page 4 . . .
Accordingly a band of happily p r i -
med and be-toppered Prominent Mining
Men, some nineteen strong, were s u i t -
ably conveyed to Regent's Park i n the
lunchtime of Thursday, Nov. 28th. An
enchanted Bedford College witnessed
their a r r i v a l and reunion with the well
fed hero. The l a t t e r was shortly a f -
terwards triumphantly chaired (by two
of the Stronger Prominent Mining Men)
to a place of honour on the dais be-
forethe assembled Union. This entry
was marked by deep gasps of admiration
and the muffled thunder of throbbing
pulses.
The perspiring Support Party seat-
e d themselves along the reserved front
row and the secret r i t u a l began. There
was a fighting speech of welcome from
Mines' Buxom Sweetheart, and an i n t r o -
duction of our hero by the Most Promi-
nent Mining Man: "He i s a very notable
Mines' Kan. Prom his windswept hair
(most d i f f i c u l t of a l l styles to ach-
ieve), to the toes of his gleaming
Hessians, he poses as the advertisement
for the Man of Fashion. His waistcoat
wa3 chosen with a nice eye; his beer
coloured pantaloons show not one crease.
No amount of studied nonchalance, no
t a i l o r i n g , can conceal the muscle i n
his thighs, or the strength of his
shoulders. Above the starched points
of his s h i r t c o l l a r , a weary, handsome
face shows i t s owner's disillusionment.
The "Beau rose to the occasion
magnificently. In a short and witty
speech (writes Our Special Correspond-
ent) he suggested. The Buxom Sweet-
heart, enthralled, kissed a l l the Pro-
minent Mining Men. In the case of
certain Avaricious Prominent Mining Men
(one of them married), she kissed them
twice.
With the discretion that marks
true gentlemen the v i s i t o r s departed
with their Champion to the nearest
hostelry. Here the "Beau's" newly
acquired hockey s t i c k and s t r i n g of
sausages were examined. At the bot-
tom of the hockey s t i c k was found the
i n s c r i p t i o n : "Honi s o l t qui mal y
pense."
