Srd.U.L. Winter Athletic Competitions.
I n the f i e l d events seotion of l a s t
week's athletios at Mbtspur Park, I.C.
showed up r e r r badly against other
University Colleges and Hospitals, be-
ing placed 6th, i n the "Tjalve Trophy"
competition. Two members of our team
f a i l e d to arrive on time, thus throwing
away points. The only event whioh we
won was the hop, step, and jump, i n
which Dave Smith and a promising fresher
John Constable were placed 1st. and 4th.
respectively, with leaps of 43'11" and
40'5". A good e f f o r t by regulars John
Newman and Bob Lloyd brought us Srd.
place i n the shot, but the only other
place which we obtained was 5th. i n the
discus with Newman and Harry Abbott,
who i s now back with us after a year's
'rest'. Our long jumpers and j a v e l i n
throwers were badly off form and i n the
high jump we could not produce two
Jumps of 5'0" - which incidentally
would have gained 5th. place.
In the relays, however, the sprint-
ers are to be congratulated on running
exceptionally w e l l , a just reward for
the regular t r a i n i n g which most of them
have been doing on the track. The team
was composed mainly' of freshers -
Dave Jones, Keith Ludlam, and Chris
Warren - and with U.L. sprinter Bernard
C u r t i s and J-miler Pete Goodwin to
complete the team, they came 2nd. and
3rd. i n the 4 x 110 and the 220,220,440
relay f i n a l s . However, due to a poor
performance i n the long relay ( 880,880,
1 m i l e ) i n which we were only 4th. we
l o s t the Belays Cup by one point t o
Kings' College.
The lesson to be learnt from t h i s
opening match i s that i f we are going
to regain the University Champs. Cup
i n may, our f i e l d events men must
f o l l o w the example of our- sprinters
and t r a i n harder. Regular indoor sess-
ions of only 30 minutes on the'I.C.
C i r o u l t w i l l progessively b u i l d up
strength and stamina throughout the
winter, and opportunity f o r coaching
Is provided by the U.L.A.C, who hold a
coaching week on 14th-18th. A p r i l at
Hotspur Park, national Coaches are i n
attendance at t h i s very Inexpensive
course and athletes l i v e - i n at the
ground. This course i s always very pop
u l a r - many people go every year - so

WOMEN'S SWIMMING
Onoe more I.C. Women's Swimming
Club has entered the University of
London Women's Swimming League. This
year, however, they are forming a joint
tesa with Middlesex Hospital Medical
School, since both experience the same
difficulties in forming a team every
week. So far, the results of this
term's matches have been most encour-
aging. In these three matches,
I.C.W.S.C.'a contributions to the team
were Janet Petersen, Judy Lemon, Hilary
Tompsett and Pat Herman.
I.C. * M.H. v. Kings' Won 29-20
I.C. a M.H. v. U.C. Lost 20-50
I.C. A M.H. V. Westfield
Won 31-22.
S O C C E R
Por most of the matches t h i s term
the 1st.II forwards have accepted most
of t h e i r chances at goal, scoring 49
goals i n 12 games. For the l a s t two
matches, however, while the defence hat
played soundly and general t a c t i c s hav
been good, the forward line has missed
many chances. This was p a r t i c u l a r l y
evident against Varndean, Brighton,
where I.C. attacked continuously with
open f o o t b a l l down both wings. Suff-
i c i e n t chances were created f o r over'
a dozen goals, but I.C. had to be
content with two, one of them scored
from a penalty by D.Joyce.
Against L.SJS. on Wed.27th.Hqv.
the result was a draw, 0 - 0 , t h i s being
a f a i r result i n a game i n which both
defences were i n control. For a period
of 20 mins. i n the f i r s t h a l f , I.C.
applied constant pressure on the oppon-
ents' goal and could w e l l have scored.
I.C. defeated Kew Association 4 - 3
on Sat. 23rd. Hov. i n what was a very
enjoyable f i x t u r e , suitably concluded
by a pleasant evening at the "Cobwebs',"
Richmond.
The 2nd. I I , although heavily de-
feated by Clement Danes G.S., who w i l l
oppose I.C. 1st. l a t e r t h i s season,
have won their last two League games
( one against the leaders, L.S.7. IT)
and are now challenging f o r the
leadership of the d i v i s i o n . The 3rd.
and 4th. teams have consolidated t h e i r
positions at the top of divisions I I
and IT respectively with recent
v i c t o r i e s .

I.C.C.C.C. Regains Prestige
On 23rd. Nov., i n a quadruple match
against Southampton, Cranwell, and
Ranelagh, I.C. produced the strongest
team to appear this season, due p a r t l y
to the absenoe of a U.L. f i x t u r e , and
partly to the match being an u n o f f i c i a l
t r i a l f o r the Club's f i r s t team i n the
University Champs. The result was a
glorious v i o t o r y f o r I.C. with the
whole team of seven Inside 30 mins.
and a l l producing personal best perfor-
mances. J . C o l l i n s , Inside 28 mins.,
was 4th, J.Conway 5th, R.Landbeck 8th,
and other I.C. positions 12th, 15th,
and 19th. i n a f i e l d of 40 runners.
The defeat of Southampton University
was p a r t i c u l a r l y pleasing, as they
provide tough opposition f o r the U.L.
2nd. team, and they won the Hyde Park
Relay last year.
On 30th. Nov. the Club e a s i l y de-
feated a rather weak Romford A.C. team
i n an uneventful match, except f o r a
fantastic e f f o r t by Keith Wall, who
achieved a time of 28m. 40s. and earned
a place i n the I.C. f i r s t tesa f o r the
U.L.Champs.
Against Westminster College on 20th.
Nov. I.C. had an easy win; the indiv-
i d u a l winner was John C o l l i n s .
Three of our members were i n the
University team whioh l o s t to S.L.H.
on 30th.Nov. John C o l l i n s , the I.C.
Captain, ran extremely w e l l to f i n i s h
i n 3rd. place, and was the f i r s t ff.L.
man home.
The University Championships are
being held tomorrow, and the Club's
recent improvements indioate that we
have a good chance of winning for the
second year i n succession. Our only
serious opposition i s l i k e l y to oomesb.
from L.S.E. who also have a strong tea
t h i s year, and the result may be very
close. The strength of I.C.C.C.C. i s
shown by the huge entry of seven teams.

Record Score Against U.C.
In the 4th. round of the Engin-
eers Cup the I.C. 'A' team continued
their run of successes by beating U.C.
with the record score of 595 out of
600. Since ao tfther team is. the f i r s t
division has woa more than one match,
the I.C. 'A' and *B' teams are first
and second with 4 and 3 wins respect-
ively.
The >c team has the highest
aggregate in tha second division, but
has been narrowly beaten la tea matches.
The three lower testis' hare woa a l l
