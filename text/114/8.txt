A NEW CONSERVATISM
" I t ' s the same the whole world over.
I t ' s a shame l i f e ain't so nide;
But you 'as to g r i n and hear i t ,
Or pay a bloody prioe."
There i s a p o l i t i c a l spectrum, and
d i f f e r e n t types choose different colours
F i r s t l y , there are thoss who l i k e t h e i r
p o l i t i c s cut and d r i e d : - they accept
the underlying assumption behind some
p o l i t i c a l theory and then r e l y on l o g -
i o a l developments f o r answers to sooial
and humanist problems; Scientists
might f i n d t h i s method attractive. A
whole mass of jargon and sometimes mean-
ingless terms have evolved from t h e i r
arguments. Others, influenced by up-
bringing, parents' p o l i t i c a l opinions,
and (unconsciously!) the psychological
l a b e l they bear, just are what they are
and remain so f o r the rest of t h e i r
l i v e s , with few exceptions. Some,
with the independence of youth, react
with varying degrees of violence against
t h e i r domestic p o l i t i c a l atmosphere,
many people, i n many ways sensibly but
i n other ways unfortunately, take l i t t l e
Interest i n p o l i t i c s . They f i n d the
subject boring and are generally apa-
t h e t i c unless events manage to s t r i k e
some chord of emotional fervour.
"They" are then blamed "or everything;
"they" i n t h e i r turn blame economic and
s o c i o l o g i c a l e n t i t i e s . The r e a l scape-
goat may not even exist. F i n a l l y there
sre lovers, warmongers, and mathematic-
ians, who never play f a i r and have very
widely varying shades of opinion.
Cynics and " i n t e l l e c t u a l s * w i l x prob-
mbl" not be reading t h i s a r t i c l e .
Let us forget, f o r a moment, the
existence of t h i s p o l i t i c a l spectrum
and give a l i t t l e tho ;ght to the f o l l -
owing point, which we think i s best i l -
lustrated by a oertain aspect of college
l i f e . The student at I.C, i s being
continually presented with new amen-
i t i e s . He has a new Union, new lab-
oratories and lecture h a l l s , new Hoste-
l s etc. In f a c t , during the l a s t few
years student l i f e had been endowed
with a good deal of almost luxurious
necessities. Is the recipient of
these items any happier? One only
has to read FELIX to f i n d out that;
he has found considerably more to com-
p l a i n about. He has become a good
deal more c r i t i c a l and there i s a
danger of him becoming too much the
f a u l t - f i n d e r . Of course, while we
hope that students w i l l appreciate and
value t h e i r ever expanding college, we
think that the f a u l t of becoming too
c r i t i c a l i 3 an eminent one i n the 'out-
side' world. Although we should s t r i v e
to make our country a better place to
l i v e i n , we must always be aware of the
danger of making the man-Tin-the-street
too fussy and too ready to blame that
scapegoat c a l l e d authority. What the
'new Conservatism' i s i n fact aiming
t o do i s to encourage the individual
to think about h i s personal responsi-
b i l i t i e s - not l e t the 'State' think
fox him. (One of the most controver-
s i a l examples of a personal responsi-
b i l i t y i s that of providing f o r one's
o l d age by family saving, not by i n d i -
scriminate, compulsory, impersonal
State schemes.)
Conservatism aims at preserving
the best i n c a p i t a l i s t society, part-
i c u l a r l y the individual drive and cha-
racter. There are r e a l dangers of
"big business" and the trade unions a l -
ternating i n their control of the coun-
try's eaonomy, although the worker i s
agreed to be winning the b a t t l e . Un-
fortunately, t h i s tragic s t r i f e haa
degenerated into a p o l i t i c a l slanging
match. Nationalisation moans ever-
increasing power f o r the State and l a r -
ge numbers of both small-time and
benevolent c a p i t a l i s t s w i l l suffer.
Increasing automation i s a problem
which w i l l have t o be solved regardless
of the p r e v a i l i n g p o l i t i c a l system.
What i s needed i s an essentially prag-
matic approach to these, and other
economic d i f f i c u l t i e s , bearing i n mind
that a government's job i s to rule and
to uphold the law, and not to act as a
charitable i n s t i t u t i o n . Peaceful co-
existince, and not expensive indulgence
i n dramatic "coups" which do not come
off, should be the keynote of Conser-
vative's new foreign policy. The o l d
School t i e , imperialism, colour prejud-
i c e , fanatical patriotism, feudalism,
plutocracy; a l l these have been popu-
l a r l y associated with conservatism i n
the past. Looking into the future, i f
our country i s to survive i n an expand-
ing world where individual freedom i s
not forgotten for emotional theories
based on past mistakes, then our new
conservative policy must irrevocably
wipe out these aspects. Otherwise
conservatism i t doomed to f a i l u r e .

THE NEW LIBERALISM
"Science has created a new world. The
key to i t i s nuclear power. We have
to l i v e i n that world - to turn i t
from a t e r r o r into an opportunity."
Jo Grimond.
This i s not a statement of Liberal
policy. I wish to give you some idea
of the l i n e s along which l i b e r a l s are
thinking and working towards the goals
of Liberty, Opportunity and Security
for everyone i n B r i t a i n and throughout
the world.
There i s not enough friendship and
co-operation i n our society today -
s e l f - s a c r i f i c e and small acts of charity
are sadly lacking. I t i s a general
attitude, only too evident i n a large
c i t y l i k e London and reflected by crime
s t a t i s t i c s and cruelty to children and
animals. I t i s an attitude whioh w i l l
not go u n t i l we have freedom i n the
true L i b e r a l sense of the word.

THE NEW
The Parliamentary Labour Party was
founded i n 1919, because of th« need
f o r working class representation i n
Parliament. I t took as i t s basic ob-
jects the Social Ownership of the
means of production,.distribution and
exchange. Most of the impetus f o r the
acceptance of these objects was emot-
ional rather than r a t i o n a l * Emotional-
l y , the working class reacted against
the obvious unfairness of c a p i t a l i s m
as i t then existed. But the p o l i t i c a l
movement did have the beginnings of a
theoretical basis. This theory came
from consideration of the recurrent
cycles of booms and slumps. In the
c a p i t a l i s t system, the p r o f i t s of
business lay i n the hands of a few.
The value of a commodity i s decided
by three things: wages, necessary i n -
vestment and p r o f i t s . Thus i t 1B e v i -
dent that i f unnecessary (from the
economic point of view) p r o f i t s are
made on a r t i c l e s , then the t o t a l
amount of money In the consumer mar-
ket cannot buy back everything pro-
duced. This leads to over production
( s t r i c t l y speaking, under consumption)
and businessmen l a y off some of t h e i r
workers. Unfortunately, t h i s further
reduces the ""mey of the consumers s a t
slumps oc j. rhls was described as
"the inherent contradiction In capit-
alism - abundance of commodities means
poverty f o r the majority of the people."
On t h i s problem, the Labour Party
i s divided. Some members consider t h i s
theory of c r i s e s to have been disprov-
ed, as we have had a comparatively
lengthy period without slumps; others
point to factors suggesting why our
next slump has merely been postponed
due mainly to the constant demand f o r
mors armaments sines the war, and the
huge demands f o r consumer goods due to
the unparalleled destruction caused by
the l a s t »ar, and they point to the
present s i t u a t i o n In America to j u s t -
i f y t h i s .
SOCIALISM
Rather than t a l k i n g about changing the
society, they are therefore more con-
cerned with reforming and improving
the e x i s t i n g society. The p o l i c i e s
they advocate are moderate enough to
attract the middle c l a s s voters; and
.radical enough to maintain the support
of the working class.
Their moat important proposal i s
contained i n the document "Industry and
Society" which outlines the programme
f o r acquiring shares i n firms - mainly
the i n e f f i c i e n t firms. Although i t i s
not intended, In any case, to acquire
control over the f i r m s , i t i s hoped
that even the threat of such action
would force employers to consider their
workers' interests more, and lead to
better worker-management relations.
Such a policy attracts the working
c l a s s , f o r i n t h i s way they w i l l have
a greater say i n the management of i n -
dustry, whilst not alienating middle-
class voters. This haa been done even
by Tory governments, as i n the eases
of the Suez Canal Company and the
Anglo-Iranian O i l Company.
The money to acquire shares w i l l
come from the surplus cn Labour's
Superannuation scheme. Every member
of the community w i l l contribute t o -
wards t h i s central fund, which w i l l
be used f o r investment. The p r o f i t s
from the investments w i l l provide
guaranteed pensions for everyone. In
t h i s way, without alienating b i g bus-
i t a s s , every worker w i l l be secure i n
bis old age. This scheme i s modelled
on a similar one introduced by Br Ad-
enauer' s ejorernment i n West Germany,
and i s ths main income-raising side
of the Sew S o c i a l i s t proposals.
When the Labour Government takes
offioe (sometime before 1960) these
proposals w i l l be put into effect and
i t w i l l he seen whether their theories
or those of the Old S o c i a l i s t s are cor-
