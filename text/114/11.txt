I.C. gain revenge
I.C. defeated ^..ngs', t h e i r only
oonquarors l a s t season, by 4 matches
to 2 at Eighgate. M i l l s bad a close
match, only getting home on the last
green, after an excellent round i n
l e v e l fours. Constable also had a
narrow win, but gave the impression
that he had plenty i n hand. However,
Parkinson followed what has almost
become a t r a d i t i o n amongst I.C. cap-
tains, when he went down, unluckily,
after an intense struggle, Anderson
played w e l l to beat a formidable
opponent on the 16th. green, and
Seriven made v i c t o r y certain by e a s i l y
winning the secretaries' match. Derby-
shire was a l i t t l e unfortunate i n los-
ing, but t h i s may have been due to
playing the l a t t e r stages of h i s match
i n darkness.
I.C. continued t h e i r undefeated
run with a v i c t o r y against a below-
strength Guy's Hospital team, i n
which M i l l s won his l a s t match for
the College before leaving to become
a lecturer at Glasgow University.
Parkinson and Constable won e a s i l y , as
did Anderson, who i s i n great form t h i s
season. Scriven, after taking an early
lead, met unexpectedly strong oppos-
i t i o n , and had to be s a t i s f i e d with
a h a l f . Derbyshire, however, could
not produce the golf that established
him i n the College team and lost,
making the result 4^- - I f i n favour
of I.C.

HOCKEY
On Nov. 20th the f i r s t Stephenson
Cup match was played. Guilds beating
B.C.S. 2-1 i n a olose-fought but even-
tempered game. B.C.S. opened the score
ing with a somewhat fortunate goal,
passed f r o a an attacker's foot.
Although shaken, Guilds did not panic,
and they drew l e v e l after a scramble
on the edge of the c i r c l e . In the sec*
end h a l f Holmes put them ahead with a
well-taken snot from a long corner.
The game ended with R.C.S. attacking
the Guilds goal with every man, but t o
no a v a i l .
FIBST DEFEAT
On Nov. 2Srd the 1st XI suffered
i t s f i r s t defeat of the season at the
hands of St Catherine's, Cambridge.
I.C. was under strength with one defen-
der and several forwards not available
for various reasons. Added to this the
Inside right arrived too late f o r the
early start that had been arranged and
Packer came into the forward l i n e .
Shortly after the start the I.C. Cap-
t a i n , Graham Zing, strained his back
and was a passenger on the l e f t wing
f o r the remainder of the match. He w i l l
be out of action f o r a while with a
slipped disc - we wish him a speedy r e -
covery. I n spite of a l l these misfor-
tunes, I.C. l o s t by only1
2-0 thanks t o
good work by the defence, especially
the f u l l backs Macrae and Godfrey.
GQHVIBCING WIH
Against St Peter's H a l l , Oxford on
Nov. 27th I.C. won convincingly by 5-2.
Solway opened the scoring with a reverse
s t i c k shot from the l e f t which was mis-
judged by the goalkeeper. Then Holmes,
with a well-taken f l i c k from, a centre
from the right and some strong approach
work added three in?re before half-time.
After the interval St Peter's Hall
came back into the game and scored
with two good shots but Holmes added
a f i f t h for I.C. to put the result be-
yond doubt.
The 1st and 3rd XIs were at Ted-
dington am' the 2nd XI at Harlington
f o r three matches against N.P.L. on
Nov 30th. The 1st won a fast game 2-0
thanks t o M i l l e r and a good solo ef-
f o r t by De Broekert. The opposing i n -
side forwards, though with good s t i c k
work i n midfield, found their attacks
continually broken up before reaching
the c i r c l e , p a r t i c u l a r l y J.U the sec-
ond half when the I.C, defence showed
better control of the situation.
The 2nd XI l o s t a close game 3-2 and
the 3rd l o s t 2-0.
The 1st XI goes into the 2nd round
of the U.L. Cup, where they meet U.C.,
with an excellent record behind them.
Their record, i n f a c t , has improved
beyond recognition on that of l a s t
season.

against the 1st team of the B r i s t o l Un-

handicapped by a shortage of w i l l i n g
players, I.C.W.S.C. was just defeated.
This did not i n the least dampen their
