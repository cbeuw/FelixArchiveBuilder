festering LETTERS T O THE EDITOR shame
Deer S i r ,
Hay I encroach on yom- space t o
•oan b r i e f l y ? We seem t o have l o s t
sight of the F i r s t P r i n c i p l e of Ragging
- 'The object of a rag i s t o oause the
maximum possible inconvenience to the
raggeea with the minimum of damage'.
Ideally t h i s leaves the Great B r i t i s h
P u b l i c to go on i t s way muttering
'Hooligans' and 'Teddy Boys', and the
Gents i n Blue Zoot Suits to thumb fran-
t i c a l l y through the handbook f o r some
excuse t o take a hand and c o l l e c t t h e i r
usual shower. But please l e t ' s not
open oar doors or distribute pyrotech-
nics among children on railway p l a t -
forms e t c - i t gives the G.B.P. a l e g i t - ,
imate moan, and the G. i n B.Z.S. the
chance to favour us with t h e i r unwel-
come presence.
I t i s easy t o c r i t i c i z e , and I
must at least suggest some l i n e s on
which we may, within the F i r s t P r i n c i -
ple and.without5the,G. i n B.Z.S., cause
with l i c k , most g r a t i f y i n g chaos.
There was once a College P r i n c i p a l
who conducted a student through b i s
domain (and fed him) under the impres-
sion he was an American Prof,

unthinkable, but i f several new exhi-
b i t s appeared - Archimedes' Bath per-
haps, or maybe Newton's Apple, or even
the chi3el used by,Rutherford to s p l i t
the atom....we might even have photo-
graphs i n FELIX - and the G.B.P. and £.

the beau
.FROM THE CO-EDITRESS OF "BEDFORD NEWS"
Dear S i r ,
May I , on behalf of my readers,
express our appreciation of that so
d e l i g h t f u l Beau you sent to us l a s t
week. I t was not, alas, an important
motion on the agenda that attracted
such crowds to our Onion General Jfeet-
Ing on that f a t e f u l day. He were a l l
v a s t l y intrigued to meet our Beau of
the Tear, and found him a worthy win-
ner Indeed of t h i s competition.
Lst us say at once that he surpas-
sed a l l expectations and M s photograph.
As he stood on the platform, h i s down-
east eyeu and modest demeanour i n great
contrast to h i s sturdier and more voc-
iferous attendant swains, he surely
appealed as much to the maternal as to
the Beau-hunting i n s t i n c t s of every
ens of us. He are very pleased with
him, s a l hops to see him (and oo.) at
Bedford im the future. Have we at l a s t
r e a l i s e d the long-felt need ef a pep-
per-uppsrf Bay he eeutinue to bright-
en etas days.
Tours sincerely,
F e l i c i t y A. Aytea.
society of the church
Dear S i r ,
Our aim as students should be the
grasp of the b a s i c p r i n o i p l e s of our
subjects and the application of these
to p r a c t i c a l problems. The less im-
portant d e t a i l s can be assimilated l a -
t e r t o our p a r t i c u l a r s p e c i a l i s a t i o n .
We b e l i e v e the same considerations ap-
ply t o C h r i s t i a n work and witness i n "
a University, and that the differences
a r i s i n g from denominational practice
should be set aside, i n favour of work
Ing with others of different Churches
I n presenting the Gospel of Jesus
C h r i s t .
Dsnominatianal differences ar$
s l i g h t and are somehow magnified by
those who oppose C h r i s t i a n i t y .
The basis of the C h r i s t i a n Union
i s consistent with the chief confes-
sions of F a i t h of the Protestant
Churches and thus i t i s possible f o r
Christians from a l l denominations to
meet i n fellowship and t o unite
i n witness. Although other
C h r i s t i a n " c e l l s " e x i s t i n the Col-
lege, we maintain that to form these
on a denominational basis would only
serve to create unnecessary and addit-
i o n a l confusion i n the minds of those
seeking the Truth.

Derek Butters,
Dear S i r ,
The leaders of the S.C.M. wish to
refute a statement made by Mr Peter
Evans i n the l a s t Issue of FELIX con-
cerning the formation of a Church Soc-
i e t y . At no time has there been any
consultation between our committee and
Mr Evans.
I n the matter of the formation of
such a society we f i r m l y support the
Union p o l i c y of non-denominational
C h r i s t i a n societies as at present In
I.C.
We also deplore,the fact that the
proposed society would be run from
outside the College «*d not by stu-
lentsof I.C.

discount
Dear S i r ,
I f any of your reade.rs are intend-
ing to buy any sporting goods f o r C h r i -
stmas, I suggest that they t r y 'Gordon
Lowe's* - a sports o u t f i t t e r s i n
Knightsbridge, where, a student from
I.C. i s given a 10jo reduction i n price.
A large v a r i e t y of f i r s t - c l a s s sports
clothing and equipment i s stocked.
Most of us know that free memb-
ership i s given to students by Cy
Laurie's Jazz Club. Does anyone know
of any other such concessions?

Sir
We havj a l l been i n public wash-
rooms and used automatio towel dispen-
sers,' For myself, i have always thought
them most convenient and had never
Seen one out or order. nut that was"
before they were i n s t a l l e d i n the Union
building. I have hardly ever seen
those there when they were not out of
order and spewing lengths of sodden and
f i l t h y towelling on t o the f l o o r .
This i s not only r e v o l t i n g to 1-ok
at; obviously i t i s also very unhyg-
enic. Why do these things always hap-
pen to I.C.? Our Union might almost 1 be
dedj '•ed as a monument t o mj.3fortun.Af

warning
Lear Peter,
This i s an awful l e t t e r I have to
write to you,, and I must 3ay I f e e l ter--

be.
To s t a r t with I deceived you; I
do have a boy f r i e n d with whom I am
going Out at the moment. I have been

f i r s t time I r e a l i s e d I was i n love
with him after he -proposed to me. I
said yes and now I f e e l I oannot possi-
b l y go out with you on Tuesday. Please
forgive me f o r doing t h i s to you - i t
seem3 a horrible mean t r i c k but on the
other hand I could not f e e l happy about
the evening.
Tours sincerely,

S i r ,
I am conducting a sociological
investigation into the way of life] of
the Oblong t r i b e , a hitherto unknown"
pygmold^negroid cuboid race,inhabit-
ing the unexplored hinterland of New
Guinea
The papers presented during the
course of the investigation w i l l , where
possible, be printed i n a special
Oblong supplement to the Spring E d i t -
ion of PHOENIX* and, this being so, I
should he grateful i f a l l f i e l d work-
ers wpuld attempt to collate and sub-
mit t h e i r findings by Monday Jan. 13th
the c l o s i n g date f o r this issue.
As examples of the type of-data
required, I can do no better than to
point out t h e , t i t l e s of two papers
already ssnt i n : "Ths Tribe with Three
Legs",and "Ths Tribe w i t h Three Sexes?
these exemplify ths high standard of
the material we are hoping to receive.
