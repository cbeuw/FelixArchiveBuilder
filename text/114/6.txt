VIEWPOINT
EXPLORATION
Several highly successful expedi-
tions have been run by students from
t h i s college during the l a s t few years.
But what of future plan3? - To judge
from the Explorations Board's in-tray
only a follow-up expedition of a r e -
search nature which,might w e l l have
been backed from other, sources, i s
forthcoming.
Surely research projects are not
the only thing whioh can come from
I.C.'s once teeming brain. The Explo-
r a t i o n Board has been c r i t i c i s e d f o r
not broadcasting the fact that funds
are available, but surely there are
some members of the College enthus-
i a s t i c enough to enquire: the o r i g i n a l
fund was brought about l a r g e l y through
the e f f o r t s of a couple of keen stud-
ents.
The Bxploration Society i s being
formed t o encourage the formation of
plans f o r future expeditions, t o pass
LIMERICK COMPETITION
This year there were no outstanding
limericks i n the printable section.
M.J.Blacker produced two quite reason-
able attempts which could have been im-
proved but nevertheless gained him a
prize of one bottle of brandy, which he
had better c o l l e c t from the Editor soon.
The unprintable section produced
some limericks of a rather higher order ,
The f i r s t prize goes to Chris Gravina
for a student who took a dumb blonde
for a walk (and found she wasn't so
dumb). W i l l he please c o l l e c t h i s ba-
nana from the Editor's fume cupboard.
MT Gravina also produced e a s i l y the
most r e v o l t i n g entry.
Second place was shared by B.F,
Channon, whose student learned h i s
lesson the hard way, and John D e l l :
"Did desperate things with a fork."
A clever young student from York
Once pierced h i s leg with a fork.
He said "Oh, dear, dear
They'll a l l think I'm queer
With four holes and a comical walk."
A clever young student from York.
Who was addicted to baked beans and pork
Once lay on h i s turn pork
In the b o i l i n g hot sun
And brought down two MiGs and a hawk.
on knowledge gained and to promote
wider i n t e r e s t i n exploration i n the
College. Two major expeditions having
returned, each catering i n the main f o r
s p e c i a l i s t i n t e r e s t , i t i s hoped, that
opposition from the ^vested interest"
of the mountaineering and departamen-
t a l groups w i l l be dropped.
One hopes that the new Club w i l l
be as independent as possible of the
Exploration Board. I t w i l l be a student
society and as such we wish t o remain
free to make our own decisions and c r i -
ticisms, although we should be very,
g r a t e f u l f o r advice from the experienced
explorers at present on the board.
It would c e r t a i n l y be very useful
for a future leader t o f e e l that he had
the weight of a l i v e l y student body be-
hiind him i f he got mixed uc i n the
mere bureauoratic tramraellings0 f the
Board.

1, Is there going to be a decent l i b -
rary i n Prince's Gardens,,or i s the ex-
i s t i n g Union Library, f o r a l l i t s qual-
i t i e s with the limited resources at i t s
disposal, going to remain the sole out-
post of English Literature and Art i n
the College?
2. Are there going to be Music Rooms
for serious practice, and a room f i t t e d
with high quality sound reproduction
equipment f o r those wishing to l i s t e n
to gramophone and tape recordings?
3. What cooking f a c i l i t i e s are going
to be provided, or i s everyone going to
be expected to eat i n the refectories?

Our Architectural Correspondent writes;
Enquiries have shown that ftt the
present there are no plans f o r incorpor-
a t i n g l i b r a r y f a c i l i t i e s in the Halls
of Residence. Any such f a c i l i t i e s that
may be provided w i l l be on the central
s i t e .
Music rooms are planned on the lower
floors of the South block, what they
are, and how extensive thc;r rnay be i s
not known. Nothing seems to be known
about the f a c i l i t i e s offered.

STOP PPESS
It has been decided that I.C. will
after a l l have to meet Westminster in
the quarter-final of the U.L. Rugby Cup.
Nothing i s known about the cooking
f a c i l i t i e s that are going to be incorp-
orated, i f any. A study, of the model
bedrooms f a i l e d to show anything i n
this l i n e .
We hope the planning office or the
architects may be able to enlighten us
on these points i n the near future.
questions
Dear S i r ,
At the Rector's College meeting, time
for questions seemed to have been d e l i b -
erately cut short. Was this a means of
ovoiding any c r i t i s m , i t c e r t a i n l y seem-
ed to be so from h i s look of surprise
when the question of a swimming pool
was raised. I f this was the case I would
l i k e to raise three questions to which,
perhaps, FELIX night be able to get
answers.
