DEAD LOSS
Dear Sir,
Whilst this i s an old 017, i t was
painfulIT obvious from last Saturday's
(llth) dance that i t oould stand rep-
etition. I f the I.C. hops are te be
a continued success, the men, who spend
the major part of the dance occupying
that quarter of the floor by the main
doors, must realise that no matter how
elegant they may look, the girls have
come to dance and not see a floor show.
Should 'lack of women' be offered
as an excuse, I nay point out that
there were plenty of women sitting round
the side during every dance, with the
possible exception of the last waits.
It seems that by this time even the
most reticent of persons has mustered
sufficient courage for a last frantio
effort.
Finally Sir, i n the earlier part
of the danoe, two attractive girls were
having to danoe together, and one of
them, referring to the elegant statues,
was heard to ask "Are they a l l dead?"
These then, i t would seem, are the
deplorable depths to whioh I.C.
masculinity - once renowned throughout
the whole of the universi-ty - has
fallen. In the interests of our rep-
utation I ask the people oonoerned to
overcome their inertia or else occupy
their Saturday evenings with some less
'hazardous' pursuit.
Tours faithfully,
Brian Marshall.
RED HERRING
Dear Sir,
With reference to Peter Jarman'a
letter "Seeing Red", may I clarify soma
points. There i s an impression in the
College that the Marxist Croup, of their
own eheeaing, are using the Literary
and Debating Sooiety as a front. In
fact, two years ago we submitted the
oonsitution of a proposed "Marxist Foram"
to the S.C.C. with the normal number of
supporting signatures. The consitution
failed to receive the required second
reading; the opinion of the S.C.C. being
that the Marxist Group should function
within the Literary and Debating Sooiety.
Neither the Marxists nor the L.4 D.S.
consider this satisfactory. We see no
reason why any differentiation should be
drawn between the Marxists and other pol-
i t i c a l , religious and philosophical soc-
ieties i n the College. W
e would point
out that we have been active for a longer
time than, for instance, the Liberals and
would ask to be treated with the
consideration.
Tours sincerely,
R.D.Leigh

NO TITLE
Dear Sir,
I aa sparred on by the delicious
though that a Bell B'lytng Sooiety and
a Marxist Tiddlewinks Group are to be
farmed, and I write to propose the
formation of a No Meeting Society.
The aole object of the No Meeting
Sooiety will be to have no meetings
and, as sues, i t should command the
support of a l l the brown baggers. Its
membership should reach to an a l l time
record and i t would only be natural
that the society should have a grant
several times larger than any other, say
about £9578. This grant would be
spent carefully under the guidance
of a select committee of about 357 mem-
bers but as this committee would never
meet, I would reluctantly have to spend
the money myself.
I would ask that any of your kittens
that are interested in this proposal
should contact m
e through the Union
Rack and I will promise not to reply.
Finally, I suggest that their
should be no meeting of the No Meeting
Sooiety next Monday lunohtlme at 1
.

IMPERIAL GRAMMAR SCHOOL
Dear Sir,
Fiery correspondence in your columns
between the President of ICWA and sundry
males would never have arisen had the hen'
of IC a more mature outlook towards the
ladies of the College.
The trouble is quite easy to diagnose:
most of the male students here are naught
but schoolboys at heart, and do not have
a due how to behave in company of ladies.
They leer at the ladies and discuss them
as sex-machines - even with a paltry
knowledge of this subject - and consider
themselves infinitely superior in matur-
ity to their skirted companions.
As a result, we find that only i f the
lady i s a reasonable sex-machine does any
male talk to her - how puerile 1 Come
on IC,wake up, treat the ladies in a
reasonable manner, - talk to them a least,
do not make them feel like lepers in a
oolony of Garths, - xemove that idiotic
schoolboy ban on them entering the bar, -
stop calling them' females.'
The above, when boiled down is simply
an attack on the immaturity found rife
at Imperial Grammar School. Even a l -
though you did leave school one or two
years ago, try to forget i t men.
Please don't steal any mare notioes whioh
have been erected for a definite purpose
by the authorities - i f I see any stuck
on the Beit Building this year I shall
cry - I can't stand i t any morel
When you do this, may be the ladies will
at least want to talk to you. A woman
of 19 years i s more mature i n out-
look than a man of the same age, so
don't give the ladies reason to think
they are among a horde of six-formers.

Pyjamas have been changing hands
so rapidly during the last few
weeks that I have twice gone to bed
wearing a black chiffon neglige.
I don't mind so much, but I am
getting peculiar stares from ray
floor-mates and the cleaners.

Quote of the week, from a visiting
5 American leoturer:-
"I can be just as crude as I like.
This i s really terrific."
I wander what the context
I hear that Paul Minton, Warden of
the Garden Hostel, who sent a b i l l
C of £55 to three inmates last year
O for'attaining' a few notices, was
• seen struggling with a mammoth sign
J- some 8ft. by 5ft. outside his door.
U the other night. Tut, tut Paul
|yj what would Mr Irving say!

I congratulate a l l I.C. males on
their successful "Be kind to Gill"
week. Perhaps the I.C.W.A.rians
could stage a similar benefit week
for the inmate of Room no. 72. He
certainly needs one.
SENEX MILES
Dear Sir,
As with many correspondents, "Senex
Miles" rather spoiled his case by overs'
atlng i t . I doubt i f more than a few
students at I.C. who have already
completed National Service did so after
making a firm decision to "Serve their
Country first". Such a decision would
be far more likely to confuse the issue,
for i t raises the usual problem; how
best to serve ones oountry. - When
cleaning the latrines for some quiet
backwater of the Army aa'ministration at
some reluctant outpost of the Empire,
the value of the service to one* countrj
thus rendered, can seem low indeed.
The whole matter is likely to fade
away in the next few years, but I too
would like to see and hear less of
National Service dodging and the
undignified efforts thus implied.
By a l l means take a course of
action calculated to avoid National
Servioe, but this should not be
allowed te become the sole driving
motive.
It is easy to succumb to the
blackmail of ones own petty fears,
and the course of action thus dictated
is easily rationalised.
Tours faithfully,
D.G. Clark.
