IS ATHLETICS TOO AMATEUR ?
Amateur athletics i s governed by
tha aaateur definitios, an extract of
whioh i s : - "An aaateur i s one aha has
aorar ooapeted far a saner prise or
monetary consideration in soy Athletic
Sport or Game, er Seen in anyway inter-
ested in a staked hat or wager made in
connection with say athletio competition
in which he was an entrant or oompet-
itor". Another Important rale states
that "open setting mast he rigorously
suppressed at Athletics meetings".
Thus at Amateur Athletios Meetings
the athlete strives to win for the glory
of winning alone, urged on by supporters,
who hope to share in their hero's triumph,
rather than take dividends.
The crowd and atmosphere at an
athletios meeting differs greatly from
these at a greyhound meeting. By
these rules the sport i s kept clean and
aeelthy, untainted by the few undesir-
able influences money has brought about
in greyhound and horse racing.
There are many arguments against,
and few far, a circus of professional
athletes touring countries. The
athlete may make his living from i t ,
bat i t i s unlikely he would find satis-
faction and enjoyment i n his sport.
R U G B Y
Hew that two weeks have elapsed
since our trials the position and stren-
gth of the Rugby Club i s beginning to
clarify. Having a good percentage of
the first three teams of last year s t i l l
incredibly i a College, we have a very
sound basis on whioh to build our sides
for this season) because of this strength
many freshers may be disappointed at
not finding themselves i a as high a
team as they may have expected.
The first XV have comfortably won
the first four games they have played
(sealnit rather medial s opposition)
meanwhile scoring 90 points, bat have
get some very tough games to play.
The second XT have wen both games
they have played beating the U.S. Navy
in an unasaal game last Saturday.
The Bx B have also won both their games
the ether teams having lest erne and
wea erne each.
The new season i s notable for a hig-
her rate of scoring sines more open play
i s emoearaged sad i t appears that the
resulting same i s sere enjoyable, sad
pleasant te vetch.
now that the sides are
settling down together we should have
sful season.
Athletios need never seoems a f u l l
time occupation, provided that there are
adequate training facilities for athletes
te use In their spare time. In Britain,
however, apart from London and the
Universities suoh facilities are very
rare; as a result many people do not
reach international standard.
It i s right an athlete should
saerifioe to get to the top - i t helps
to strengthen the character. If, and
when, he gets to the top, he may enjoy
the free travel to matches in countries
whioh,otherwise, he would never visit.
In that respect he i s lucky, but should
those privileges demand that he sacrifice
much money; as indeed he must, when
purchasing top class equipment and suit'
able dress, which he i s obliged to wear
at certain functions.
Although professional (or full-time)
athletios i s unwanted and undesirable,
should an athlete be allowed to aake
money by indirect means? Advertising,
broadcasting, lecturing and writing by
an amateur are, at present, forbidden;
this i s rather unfortunate as much good
could be gained. Limits, however, must
be placed on the athlete's freedom.
It i s doubtful that an athlete
eeuld make his living by these means,
but I think a limit should be placed
en what he earns. Some proportion of
his earnings could be paid directly to
the A.A.A. by the body concerned, thus
helping to finance the sport.
By these means an athlete would
help the sport, the general public and
ether sportsmen; in addition to com-
pensating for the financial hardship
he may have been through.
