A
lovely Devonshire lass from Bedford College - Raphes! Pearson - achieved
eternal fane, or rather notoriety, when she was ohosen to be K i s s C.A G.
1958" at a recent Guilds Union meeting on Thursday, Got. 16th. Bedford's
Unicorn, repainted i n Guilds oolours, was ohristened Raphael In her honour and
returned to its rightful custodians. This was the ollasx of several recent ex-
changes between Bedford and C
.
& G.
The first exchange, of the Unioorn for a "pretty pink pot", designed to be
"very oomfarable and leaving no red Bark", oocurred the previous Tuesday (see
p. 3). Then the C.A G. President, Dare Clark, invited S
O
B
S of the f a i r young
Bedford aaldnmw to stage a beauty contest at C.A G
'
.
s forthcoming Union Meeting -
the winner receiving the Unioorn. This was duly fulfilled when 13 girls of
assarted shape and sise arrived at C.A G for inspection.
RACHAEL PEARSON
The Bedford Rag President. Pene-
lope Johns, (see photo on p. 2) who
introduced the parade, was greeted
with overwhelming enthusiasm and was
unable to utter a syllable for several
minutes because of the din. Event-
ually relative silence reigned, only
to be immediately disrupted into bed-
lam when Sbe referred to the Guilds-
men as "Gentlemen". In reference to
the "p.p.p." she quoted from Proverbs:
"An abomination unto us, but a very
I help i n time of trouble".

"Gentlemen I pray you rise for
the thermometer". With these words
the hosts and freshers rose to their
feet as the R.C.S. Inaugurated the
latest series of Freshers Dinners on
the first Monday of term.
Par the f i r s t time since the
inception of these dinners there was
a surplus of volunteer hosts, and with
such enthusiasm success was guaran-
teed.
The Union entertained members of
the teaching staff and the officers
of Mines and City and Guilds. The
presence of these dignitaries occas-
ioned a surreptitious search for
those embarassing l i t t l e stories that
important people are always trying
to forget, and unimportant people are
trying to remember. The Friday
dinner was attended by the Rector
and his wife, who amused everybody
by QTrthimging elaborate and improbable
"himess stories with Mr. sad Mrs.
lea Allan.
The President of R.C.S., Fete
sassier, spoke on a l l four occasion*
with his traditional eloquence.
It was wagered that he would I'speat
himself at least onoe during the eeurae
of foar after-dinner speeches. To
his great credit he won a whisky and
ten pints of beer at the price of no
less than eight different risque
stories.
The bards and trophy officers i n
gowns, top hats and horn
rimmed spectacles, treated the assemb-
led companies to their dedicatory ode.
"Freshers, into your guiltless hands
we fling
Defence of this thermometer, a thimg
Hounded down by generations, we reoell
'Teas made last year, out of a
oistern ball."
On Friday night the man vera
Joined by the ladies ef I.C.W.A., and
after fear stag dinners i t vas good
to see them. It i s only beped that
in future years I.C.W.A. w i l l he
prevailed upon to disperse their
charm. The R.C.S. every ready t e
eater far the whims sad fancies ef
i t s I.C.W.Arieme provided vegetarian
dishes for their president 8111
niassrHiilth.
The after dinner atmosphere i a
the ear was not everjrsemy's oup of tea,
but Judging by the crowds i t was
almost evaTjrbooy's glass ef beer.
Never before have the R.C.S. male
voice choir produced suoh volume ef
song and shown such VBBSatility.
The contestants entered singly,
were helped up onto the bench by many
pairs ef very willing hands, flaunted
their virtues (and otherwise) and sat
down on the front of the bench.
They were delioiously inept at this
gracious art, and the temperature i n
the vicinity of the front row began to
rise appreciably, until the scene be-
came somewhat reminiscent of Sunday
night at the Windmill. The clothes
they wore were supposed to typify
oertain localities (Piccadilly prov-
ed very popular).
The contest was Judged by volume
of applause and there was l i t t l e
doubt as to the winner, who had used
her "38-24-36 to good advantage, assi-
sted by a f u l l skirt and yards of
f r i l l y petticoat, she purported to
com* from theWolshvillagowiththelong-
name. The Unioorn was reohristened
n.«.h«»[ and presented to her with a
kiss from the gallant President, when
popular opinion demanded a Speech.
A l l she oould say was that i t had been
torture for a l l of them - which really
was not surprising as i t was definitely
the noisiest meeting your corres-
pondent has ever attended. Tony
Owen - a tame Welshmen (from Cham.
Eng.) was persuaded to pronounce
thatWelshvillagewiththelongname,
being rewarded by a rather shy kiss
from Miss C.A G»
The next thing to change hands
was a baby's teat from Penelope t e
the President, who reciprocated by
giving her a larger "domestic uten-
s i l " to replace the "p.p.p." whioh
had been toe small.
After an earsplitting
the meeting reluctantly broke
up - the girls retiring for ooffee
with the original raiders.
• The Editor was seen afterwards
pursuing Miss C.A G. with a 40 f t .
tape measure, and later informed
your oorroo?POa4amt of the relevant
information.
