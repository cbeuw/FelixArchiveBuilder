President X&asler ia an enigmatic and
versatile character. So adaptable i s
aa, that we oan l i s t only a few of bis
aaaerOBS talents. Befitting a President
ef the R.C.S., we will do i t i n the fol-
lowing seientifio Banner:
(A) Sportsmanship.
A '22 san of '55 vintage, Peter
sassier last year attained the spirited
position of Hon. Seo. R.C.S. Rugby
Club. He has also been known te par-
ticipate in a sedentary game ef squash.
In tha I.C. Hostel, the White City ef
S. Ken., * Peter i s a prolific *
aaker of ooffee, except at bedtine when
he dismisses a l l from his aiisimei
with his usual stream of inaudible
(») Woman's-men-ehip.
Questioning him en the, subjeot of
lews, Peter replied, "Ad flams, esto
fidelia.", * as i s his deeply felt want.

As Lord Chief Justice of H.C.S. he
is a brilliant oemndttee man. This
stems from his notorious ability to

He i s really quite a geed chap.
Dees force play any part in relations
between nations? Are aaoleer weapons
se immoral that any catastrophe i s pre-
ferable?
It was with these two momentous
questions that Michael Howard, M.C.,
M.A. ef King's College, began his lecture
en the "Military Implications ef the
Hydrogen Bomb", at which there were about
160 present.
Te the first he replied that we are
s t i l l i n the age ef power polities, and
to the seoond he pointed out that
nuclear power i s not so much a question
of Morality, as of expediency. Such
power will continue to be necessary until
a World Faroe i s set up, and even then
this will require some means of assert-
ing i t s authority. "We have eaten of
the fruit of good and evil, and no amount
ef vomitting w i l l remove our knowledge
ef nuclear energy*. But, suoh a World
Faroe necessitates putting our welfare
into the hands of other who have not the
same interests, and this i s a bift step
far countries with a long history and a
high standard of living.
Nuclear weapons nay be divided into
two classes. First, the unusable
strategic weapon far attacks on enemy
territory only: "the price of destruc-
tion of your enemy i s the near destruotio
of yourself", and oan such weapons there-
fore be aa instrument of policy for us?
They earn set solely as a passive deterr-
ent, to be used only i f we are threatened
by others with nuclear weapons, or over-
whelming conventional weapons.
Secondly, there are the tactical
atomic weapons, where the range of des-
truction i s measured in hundreds of
yards: these are more economical, and
the necessary build-up of our forces oan
be achieved with them, without endang-
ering ear standard of living.
There are three points to consider
before using nuclear force:
(i) the danger of initiating the use of
A-weapons in those areas of the
world where we are trying to make
friends (e.g. Asia and the Far East).
(ii) that most wars in the future will
se through infiltration, and
geei n i n and c i v i l warfare, where
we are at a disadvantage of having
to operate through bottle-necks.
(iil)where to start? If we bomb enemy
airfields and porta, they w i l l do
the same to us, much to our dis-
advantage.
But the abdication of our responsib-
i l i t i e s would not be regarded as a moral
lead far peace, and would cause the
disintegration of our sooiety, as with
Turkey in the 19th Century.
In answer to a question from the
floor, Miohael Howard said that i{
we started sending the Americans home,
a l l other countries would do the same,
resulting in a weakening of the Western
position whioh i s dependant on the ring
of American airfields a l l around Russia.
We have no defence except in conjunction
with our Allies.

The motion: "That there should be
a university of South Kensington" did not
raise as mneh heat as Clementine in the
road outside, but there were s t i l l some
interesting points raised, both old and
new.
Dr. Coles of Physios, far example,
believed that the artist and scientist
who met over ooffee in the morning and
beer at night would both be less bored
in later l i f e , even i f they were not
less boring. That was why he favoured
a union of the Kensington Colleges.
Mr. Basil Taylor of the R.C.A.
argued that such an amalgamation would
oaaee the smaller colleges to be swamped
by I.C. He could see no bar on com-
munal activities under the existing
arrangement.
David Irving raised a standard
easiest tha University of London
administrations, Imperial College ad-
ministration sad Sennet. He was part-
icularly displeased with I.C. adminis-
tration w
h
a
m
, as he put i t , "had not
appeared to notice the articles in
Faeemix*.
After an i n i t i a l mix up with Thar
sad his haaaer, Peter Jarman wast on te
sake oat a delightful ease on the
theme:
"Life's a pleasant institution,
Let us take i t as i t comes"
"What an abortion of a University
i t would be," he cried. "Never before
have there been degrees in Chinese
pottery." He did not think artists
met scientists even in Oxford or Cam-
bridge.
From the floor, John Cox thought
that the real need for broadening the
education of soientiats (engineers
especially) should not be confused with
the creation of an artificial university
administration.
The house rejected the motion by
18 votes to 7.
R.D. Finch.
