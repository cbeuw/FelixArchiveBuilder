The first teaa narrowly lost by
one point to University College Hospital
in the semi-final of the Castaways' Cup
competition after a member of the team
has retired because of an lnfrige-
of the rules.
There were 29 teams entered for
the competition, whioh i s in effect the
intercollegiate team racing champion-
ship of the University.
The 2nd team did well to reach the
last eight and the third lost by only
three points to the eventual winners.
A very good performance was put
up by Graham Taylor who had six first
places in eight races.

The fortunes of the I.C. teams, so
far, this season have been rather mixed,
but taken overall are very promising.
The lst XI lost 6-2 last Wednesday to
Westminster, the score note representing
the oloaeness of the game. On Satur-
day, strengthened by three University
Flayers, the teaa won quite convincingly
over Q.M.C. i n a Preliminary Round of
the U.L. Cup by 6 goals te 1. On Her.
8th, at Harlington, they meat U.C. (who
beat Goldsmiths 6-1) i n the First Round
Proper, i n what should prove to be a
bard
The I.C. 2nd and 3rd XI's
in the same League have also set off to
a geed start. The I.C. 2nd XI have
beaten Battersea 4-1, but found the I.C.
3rd and U.C. 2ad teams very r* -cog aad
lest 5-4 aad 3-2 respectively. In
addition to this the 3rd XI have lest
to Chelsea 2-0 and te a vary strong
Battersea teaa, innlwrlng two U.L.
players 4-3«
The 4-th, 5th, 6th and 7th XI* s have
also done quite well i n their matches
so far, and aa the teams bseems mere
settled over the next few weeks we hope
that results will improve accordingly.
MOTORING
FRESHER WINS GUILDS RALLY
COLUMN
A fine Sunday afternoon saw a very
disappointing field of only nine oars
set off from the Union at the start of
the City and Guilds Motor Club Freshers'
Rally on Oct. 12th.
The first section was a simple route
card out of London to a deserted spot
near Dorking, the catch being that a
specific average speed had to be maintained
continuously. Competitors were warned
that there would be a secret check en-
route, but thanks to the marshals, who
with great presence of mind joined on the
end of a bus queue on the Kingston By-Pass,
only four oars got through without penalty.
Having got so far, the next section
began, and this consisted of a number of
points, to be visited in order, with a
question to be answered at each. The
clues given for locating these points var-
ied from spot heights to bearings from
latitude and longitude intersections,
distances being in some handy unit such
as thousands of inches, or kilometers.
Here too was where the weaker competitors
came to grief. A Morris 8 ran a big-
end and stopped. An M.G. just stopped.
A Morgan disappeared ( he doesn't seem to
have got back yet{)

Those that survived then had
a short break before going on to the
final section. This was of a photo-
graphic nature, each crew being given
a set of photos of sign-posts which
could be plotted by working backwards from
their designations. As darkness f e l l
over the back^woods of Surrey navigation
and driving became more difficult and no-
one reached the final control (at a
desolate fork on the side of Leith Hill)
without penalty for lateness.
Everyone made their weary way into a
cheerful English hostelry near at hand
(complete with blazing fire) and took
f u l l advantage of i t s tapped resources
while a set of provisional results was
feverishly worked out. It was soon
evident that M.I. Brunt's consistently
steady progress had won him an easy
viotory - appropriately enough a fresher
had won the Freshers' Rally.

BACK HOME
Jezebel took a party of 11 to her
home town of Guildford on Wednesday Oct.
15th. The 30 mile journey was compl-
eted without incident in just under l y
hours. The fire-engine was running
very well, taking a l l hills at over 20
mph unless baulked* It i s only up a
steep h i l l that we dare use her full
power.
After a tour round the Dennis Bros,
works, we were given a much-too-short
ride in a new, Rolls-Royce engined fire
tender. A mutinous suggestion that
this luxurious vehicle should replace
Jezebel was summarily dealt with.
We were then able to compare
Jezebel with the 1914 fire tender main-
tained by the Dennis apprentices.
Although this i s complete with pump,
the tyres have been replaoed by
pneumatios, whioh look rather incon-
gruous, though they do give a much
smoother ride.
After suitable refreshment (no. 3
for Jez, bitter for the orew), we retur-
ned to I.C. running for most of the way
on other peoples' headlights.
P.L.H.
