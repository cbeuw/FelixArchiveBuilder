EXCESS
The Bditor regrets that not a l l
of the letters and articles submitted
this week for publication could Ve nri-
nted, due purely to the shortage ef
spaoe. This i s indeed a healthy s i t -
uation and one whioh we hope will con-
tinue. In the pest, Because of the
lack of material, we have had to print
articles of dubious merit, doing cre-
dit neither te FELIX nor to the
anthers. Let as hope that those days
are new numbered allowing us to pro-
aaoe a paper truly reflecting the news
and views of Imperial College. Bat
this oan only be dome with TOUR coop-
eration.
* WORRIED"
The Editor also thanks "Worried"
for the peea, illustrating so well the
brutal callousness of the male of the
species i a matters of love. Unfort-
unately i t s Lawreatian style precludes
any possibility of publication, as I
feel i t would offend certain elements
of student society. ( i t i s grate-
fully accepted, however, for the Editor's
private anthology.)
Bditorls Mete
I feel that as the Profiles of
the constituent College Presidents
have already appeared in "The Phoenix
Review of the Session", i t i s wa-
aeoessary te repeat them here. The
"Profile" of Peter Lessler appears
here rather as a literary work, than as
a tram refleetien ef his eharaeter.

In view of the success of the Labour
Party at the recent General Election and

NOV. 5 T H .
Some day soon everyone will be
receiving l i t t l e notes from U.L.U.,
asking them to be good l i t t l e boys
and girls on the day of treason and
plot, Nov 5th. This has been caused
by the uncontrollable participation of
'outsiders' in student rags, so the auth-
orities say, although i t i s debatable
who creates the most havoc.
To combat this, the ICBC i s run-
ning i t s usual hop - cum - firework
display - cum bonfire - at Harlington.
This year the tradition continues with
even greater attractions. There will
be buses as usual from the Union, four
hot-dogs/person, lots of booze, a
quartet and Jazz band instead of records,
and the promise of the biggest bang
since the first American moon-rocket.
Tickets are the same price as for
Saturday hops, but are strictly limited.
Notices w i l l go up announcing the sel-
ling time.
