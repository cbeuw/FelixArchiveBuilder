CHRISTMAS ISLANDERS
If 70a are as theaull I fel aa we
asanas you are, you have probably
wondered why the Literary and Debating
Sooiety never scene to do anything
Literary. Between yon and the under-
signed, hardly any of then could.
However, there is a group of people
who certainly Debate, but mainly about
Literature, whioh they tend to write
themselves. They might well be called
the Literary and Debating Subgroup of the
Literary and Debating Society, after the
famous Ministry of Wroks (Works Department)
but they are not. They are the Christ-
mas Islanders.
They will next meet on Friday
OotOber 31st at 5.15 pm i n the Commltte.
fioom*off the Lower Union Lounge.
The general purpose of a l l their
meetings i s to draw each other's highly
critical attention to what they have
written, or indeed to what they have
read i f i t is interesting enough to be
unpopular. Yes, they are an unpopular
group - that i s , they are at the
opposite pole from the Mirror, Presley
and Mrs. Dale. A lot of people oall
them Snobs, whioh has been defined aa
Those Who Refuse to Admit They are
Bored. Perhaps. What the Islanders
refuse to do i s to tolerate what is
boring. C»ll them Snobs i f you like.
A fact that only an Islander would
remember is that John Donne once said
that no man ia an island - i f you are
wondering who has died, for whom the
bell tolls, i t tolls for humanity which
has lost one of its members, and conseq-
uently for you. So i f the undersigned
drown in the seas of soience for lack of
support i t will be your funeral.

At any rate, they are certainly la-
landers, living on a piece of land, KJ
fertile enough for ideas to grow and
solid enough for philosophies to be E.
built, entirely surrounded by - beer? p
Of course, they would not abstain from ~-
a treatise on Aloohol as a Means to D
Higher Mental States. Any bottle
washed up from the surrounding sea is fc
regarded as interesting until proved Q
empty. And the Islanders try not to
take anything seriously. The term
Literature can be applied only loosely
to their writings, and they usually
prefer to use the work paper.

Last Tuesday, a group consisting of
an ICWArlan, four Guildamen and two R.C.S
men converged on Bedford College i n
broad daylight to oolleot the Bedford
mascot .immediately after their lunohtlae
Union meeting. This was the final move
of a well-Dlanned operation whioh had
ineladed an 'inside survey' of the col-
lege by two of the*raiding group the
previous Thursday. This was watched
incidentally, with great interest by a
co-operative audience of residents and
staff.
Tha raid was organised i n the usual
Army fashion, each member of the group
being numbered and fully briefed in
every move they were to make. The
final instructions were issued ever
eoffee, after lunoh, i n the Hostel, sad
the party was back i n the same room less
than an hour later.
Operatives 1 and 2 entered the Bed-
ford Ce-imon room and removed the mascot
from it's oase, placing a suitable
receptacle in it's plaoo. Rem. 3,4,5,
guarded or sealed doers while Ho.7 held
epea the deer ef the hotted-up oar
driven by Mo.6.
The ear rounded the lamer Circle at
i5 a.p.a. and prooeeded back te I.C.
the rest ef the group returned by eycle
or Tube far their second oup ef oeffee.
Two hours later Bedford's Union
President telephoned the I.C. Union
office te complain that the domestic
appliance kiadly provided was toe small.
It was considered inadvisable to make the
obvious retort ever the 'phone.

'You find Carnivals improper and
disgusting'? I ask.
D-L agrees.
'I presume that, as a true scien-
tist, you base your views on experi-
mental evidence. That is. vou have
sufficient knowledge of carnivals to make
that statement.
D-L replies 'Of Course!1
I congratulate him on his persev-
erenoc i n what must have been an un-
pleasant task. 'Now do you agree that
i f we are not satisfied by a play we do
not go again.?'
•Tea'.
' Similarly i f we are not satisfied
by a dance, a sterna or an exhibition we
do gc te another one.'
'Tea but I want to tha carnivals
merely te gather material for ay artiole
replies D-L.
'Of course and I again congratulate
you. Moreover, i f you were satisfied
by the play you would seek out a similar
one and go to that i f you oould'.
•Maturea-Ly'.
'Then your problem is salved. You
oould net get your partners t o return a
second time" because they were not sat-
isfied.
Mete The phrase "to return a second
time" is used i n the sense that D-L
Implied: 'to return' and not, as i s
normal in English: te go a third time.
SCARVES
On coming up to University one is
confronted with the question " What
type of scarf should I have?" Depend-
ing somewhat on pocket and grant, the
law-ebididing citizen seeking to please
authority will choose an official one,
as will the gentleman desiring to be
both elegant and inconspicuous. But
the lover of the flamboyant, or one with
the crying need of a sleeping-bag ,
go for a large woolen scarf
The reason behind the acquisition
- a desire to impress on a l l that you
are at I.C. and University. i'y main
reason for buying one was that I got
tired of the question " and what's i t
like at Bedford?" I defy anyone to
say that now.
The art of wearing the scarf is
tricky. Worn straight, i t is a sure
trip-up or delight of the wind. The
alternative? Wound around and around
spitting out mouthfuls of wool or gab-
erdine. Really well wound, one can
neither hear, see or speak.
Frequently individuals may be tjpe
-cast from their scarf. Wound around
six times - an efficient disguise or the
owner is very cold. Colours faded -
probably never been washed or efficient
Freshers at work (cleaning 3hoes or drag-
Bring along the pavement is best) Beau-
tifully ironed - usually the thin-strip-
ed variety - the 'man about town' look.
Stringy - the resourceful type who uses
i t for a variety of jobs suoh as tying
up luggage or tripping up girls.jK H
