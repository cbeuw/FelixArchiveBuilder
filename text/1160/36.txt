Linux Users Group RCS University Challenge
Linux has been in the news a lot
recently, but, just as with other buzz
words, few ordinary people know
what it is. In its most basic defini-
tion, Linux is a collection of pro-
grams that control and run a com-
puter, usually a PC. This collection
of programs is referred to as an
"operating system". From the point
of view of the computer user, Linux
is what allows him/her to commu-
nicate with the computer. The oper-
ating system determines how a
computer runs tasks, the kind of
software that can be loaded, and
what kind of "interface" it can
have. Examples of other operating
systems are Unix, MacOs, and the
ubiquitous Windows.
If you ask the same question to
the great majority of Linux users the
answer you will probably get is:
Linux is cool. To explain this suspi-
ciously smug answer let's ask more
questions.
Why Linux?
Linux was invented because its
inventor, Linus Torvalds, did not like
what was on offer to run his PC. He
offered his brainchild free of
charge to the world, with the con-
dition that it should be kept freely
available and open to anyone who
wanted to add to it. Hence, from
the start Linux was destined to be
born and raised by creative pro-
grammers who not only wanted
quality but also took pride in their
contributions. Imagine, that the
Linux factory is the whole world,
and its personnel are some of the
best programmers anywhere - and
all are working for free!
The end result is an operating
system that is open, free, easily
available (on any archive site), sup-
ported by a huge number of users
and developers, dependable, sta-
ble and very powerful. Oh, and
free.
Something is fishy here, I hear
you mumble. Nothing can be that
good? Well... there are a few
drawbacks. Until recently, it has
been said that to own Linux meant
having to be a hacker. Nowadays
this is not entirely true, because
there are many companies and free
distributors that are producing
Linux packages that are easy to
install and easier to manage than
previous versions. In the recent Las
Vegas Comdex show Corel's ver-
sion of Linux was claimed to be
"easier to install than Windows".
More and more vendors are
realising the potential of the free
operating system market and are
writing software for Linux as fast as
they can. Some well know names
are Matlab, Mathematica, IDL, Star
Office (now owned by Sun), Corel,
and even Silicon Graphics. The
question should be rephrased to:
Why not Linux?
W h o is using Linux?
Linux is moving slowly from the
exclusive realm of Computer Sci-
ence departments to other universi-
ty departments, and ultimately to
the real world (well, almost). There
are a few companies that have
become converts after bad experi-
ences with unreiiable systems and it
is, together with Unix, one of the
best systems for Web servers. Here
at Imperial, the Linux user commu-
nity is growing and active, as exem-
plified by the activities of the Linux
Users Group and its ic-linux-group
mailing list. There are several
departments that run computers
with NT/Linux partitions and
because of its advantages for sci-
entific use it is gaining followers in
research areas.
Candid comments from a few
Aeronautics students (both under-
graduate and postgraduate): "quite
easy to install", "OK, screen fonts
need some work but I am quite
impressed with it", "I am not very
experienced but I have found Linux
to be very reliable and consider-
ably quicker than NT.it 'feels'
more stable", "Very reliable and
fun desktop", "lovely operating sys-
tem, I like going to the Internet and
find anything I like", "A lot of the
free software is brilliant".
How do I learn more?
Come to the next Linux Symposium
organised by the Linux Users
Group or, alternatively, visit

scribe to our mailing list. Hope to
hear from you soon!
The time has now come for the
Royal College of Science Union to
launch the 2000-2001 University
Challenge Campaign. Imperial
Students have won this prestigious
national competition in the past,
and earlier this year the medical
school opened up the possibility
of Constituent College Union
entry, by getting a team of med-
ical students to represent the Col-
lege on the world renowned tele-
vision show. Although their
progress exceeded that of the
'official' IC team, who never
made it to the televised rounds,
the medics performance left a lot
to be desired. The RCSU has now
taken up the baton, with its sights
firmly set on this year's trophy.
Amongst the thousands of our
students, we must be able to find
four who can combine to become
a team better than anyone else's
in the country. We definitely have
the students to win this competi-
tion - we just need to find them.
We could follow the example of
The Imperial Winds is a sub group
of the Symphony Orchestra and is
now in its third year. Under the
baton of our conductor, Colonel
Duncan Beat, the band has grown
to a regular 45 players covering a
range of abilities.
A wind band is made up of a
brass section (trumpets, trom-
bones, french horns and tuba), a
woodwind section (flutes, clar-
inets, bassoons, saxophones and
oboe) and percussion. We have a
wide ranging repertoire, covering
pieces from classical to jazz -
whatever people want to play.
Our rehearsals are fun and infor-
mal.
Our free Winter Concert will
be held on Tuesday 14th Decem-
ber at 18.30 in the Great Hall,
Sherfield. This year's programme
includes Hoist's Second Suite in F,
The Blue and The Grey (a selec-
tion of American Civil War pieces)
and Trumpets Wild along with
some festive tunes.
We always welcome new play-
our predecessors and send four
random volunteers, and hope for
the best possible outcome. How-
ever, we are looking for a group
of razor sharp, outgoing, lively
individuals capable of working
together as a team (and taking on
the formidable force of Paxman).
The selection process, will
involve you (as an individual)
proving yourself not only as a
prodigious fountain of general
knowledge, but also as a team
player, with an excellent 'televi-
sion personality'. The contest will
culminate with a democratic
selection by al! those present.
So, do you want to be on TV?
Could you outwit Paxman? If so -
and as long as you will be a reg-
istered student during the next
academic year - just turn up at the
selection meeting
Selection:
