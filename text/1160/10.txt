10 Union Felix • 6 December 1999
ICSMUnion
The Constituent College Union page returns this week with a timely round-up of important events
and developments (plus a few blatant plugs) from Medical School President Becky England.
The last few weeks have been busy
for Imperial College School of
Medicine. We are in the throws of
preparing for our dramatic/musical
extravaganza of the year, with the
ICSM Light operatic society present-
ing Crazy For You, which runs from
Monday 6th December until Friday
10th December in the Rec Centre
(behind Wilson House). This event
promises to be fantastically enter-
taining, and we are following it up
with the Soiree on the Saturday. This
is an age old St Mary's tradition
which has been rejuvenated by the
hard work of Tom Burchell and the
Operatic Society. It is an evening of
hilarity and entertainment incorpo-
rating music and drama of every
type you can imagine.
Numerous other events have
been happening in the clubs and
socs world, from musical concerts
to bops and cocktail nights. We had
a very successful bonfire party fol-
lowing the Interyear Rugby match at
Teddington on the 6th of November
(which, of course, the second years
won, as seems to happen every
year). Other clubs seem to be flour-
ishing from what I hear, and sports
are as ever keeping up their tradi-
tion of success. We want to particu-
larly point out the success of the 1 st
ICSM Rugby team, who we wish lots
of luck in the new year, with their
trip to Cork to take part in the Euro-
pean Cup.
A lot has been going on within
the medical school itself. The
Union, in conjunction with the pow-
ers that be, are looking into the
issues of transport and the amount
it can cost to travel to clinical
attachments in the district general
hospitals. We hope to collate all
information by the new year and
present a case to the relevant bod-
ies. There is also the ongoing con-
cern regarding the future of the
main base clinical sites - at the
moment we are particularly aware
of the problems at Charing Cross,
with the threatened library reloca-
tion and the potential conse-
quences of such a proposal. The
students and the Union are follow-
ing developments very closely, and
we are adamant that we will not be
losing out facilities!
A quick run down of events until
the end of term:
Opera 6th - 10th Dec
Soiree 1 1 th Dec
Carol Service 13th Dec 7pm
Bop at Charing Cross 1 5th Dec
Winter Ball 18th Dec
I'm sure other events will spring up
as the term draws to a close, as
Christmas always provokes sponta-
neous ideas! Keep your ears to the
ground.
