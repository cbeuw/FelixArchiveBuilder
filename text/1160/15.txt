Dear Kevin,
Yes! At last! Someone else
who watched "Ghostwatch" all
those years ago.... I too watched
it and was scared shitless! I pre-
tended I was a hard 12 year old
and wasn't afraid, but I woke up
terrified in the middle of the night
and had to sleep in my parents
bed for comfort! A re-run/make
is required I think...
Yours si needy,
Neil Lardcake

Dear Sir,
I feel compelled to write to you
to express my concerns over the
current proposals for the so-called
renovation of the Reynolds at
Charing Cross. Whilst I whole-
heartedly agree that the building is
in need of a thorough overhaul, I
am increasingly doubtful that this
is the way to go about it. It would
seem that the College is so des-
perate for some capital to finance
the development that they will do
anything in return for money - in
this case, they are prepared to
squeeze two units that blatantly
cannot fit into the present building
onto the site, because of a juicy
£2.5 million carrot that is being
dangled in front of them. I'm sure
similar stories abound when it
comes to decisions made over at
South Ken, with hall renovations
and the new sports centre just two
of the more obvious examples.
The real problem is that,
unless someone else comes in with
an offer of a similar level of invest-
ment, the decision is as good as
made. Prof Whitehouse insists that
the development must (and will) go
ahead, and thus this is the only
way to make it happen - and to
hell with the students if they get in
the way. It's just another example
of Imperial College's painfully
short-termist attitude to life. We
know that these units will need to
expand in the next few years. We
know that more and more more
students will be moved out to the
Charing Cross site, because of
overcrowding in the BMS and the
sheer size of the Drewe Theatre -
yet the planners and senior staff
will happily spend a massive
amount of taxpayers money on a
scheme that completely blocks any
potential for development.
The College frequently talks of
it's desire to be seen as the "MIT of
Europe", but this will never come
about until there is a serious
change in attitude. In terms of
buildings,, of investment, of
staffing and (particularly) in terms
of funding the College constantly
balances itself on a very sharp
knife-edge, living hand and
mouth, without any means of sen-
sible long-term investment. Per-
haps the appointment of a new
Rector will finally see all this
change, but by then, eighteen
months down the line, it could
already be too late...
Yours sincerely,
Charing Cross III
AND FINALLY...
Dear Sir,
I would liek to ask your read-
ers help. Christmas is fast
approaching, and I have yet to
buy a present for my girlfriend.
We've been going out for about
five months, and I have absolutely
no idea what to get for her. Fortu-
nately she's at Kings, so she won't
be able to read this, so if anyone
out there has any good sugges-
tions for something I can get her
that will produce the desired
effect, please write in.
Thanks muchly,
