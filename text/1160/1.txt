Fibre failure threatens staff salaries
GARETH M O R G A N
A hardware failure on Wednesday
24 November caused chaos with
Imperial College's payroll. Part-
time and casual staff were facing
no pay when the finance comput-
er system crashed.
The payroll system runs on
two computers: one in the Sher-
field building and one in the Cen-
tre for Computing Services in the
Mechanical Engineering building.
The system is designed to survive
a fire or other disaster at either
location. The two nodes are con-
tinuously mirrored, and linked by
fibre optic cable. The connectors
to this cable failed, causing both
computers to go down simulta-
neously.
The issue of a system failure if
the cable failed had been raised
when the system was installed,
but the link was not backed up,
due to the cost of installing a par-
allel fibre optic cable. This is the
first time since the system was
installed that it has failed, but fur-
ther failures may convince Col-
lege to install a second cable.
The system was offline for
most of Wednesday and Thurs-
day, but was recovered at around
5.00pm Thursday evening, in
time to print pay cheques on
Thursday night, allowing the
cheques to be distributed as nor-
mal on Friday. The BACS
(Bankers' Automatic Credit Sys-
tem) direct credit payments to
employees' bank accounts were
delayed, however, with payment
being credited on Monday 29
November instead of the previous
Friday.
Among those affected were
around 250 students who work
part-time for the Union or for
College as bar staff, demonstra-
tors and others who are paid on a
weekly basis. Other affected staff
were cleaners and a few techni-
cians, according to Malcolm
Aldridge, Controller of Financial
Services for the South Kensington
campus.
Mr Aldridge said that the inci-
dent was "a tragedy" but com-
mended the finance office staff,
who had worked late on Thursday
25 November to ensure that staff
were paid as soon as was possi-
ble.
Guilds Union on trial over abandoned bathtub
JIM G E A C H
City and Guilds Union, in the form
of their president, is facing discipli-
nary action over events following the
Field Cup. After the Rag event,
numerous items including a bath-
tub, a toilet, and a tree were left in
the corner of Beit Quad. The action
is being taken because of the mess
left in the Quad, and, more impor-
tantly, health and safety issues.
An ICU source said that the
Guilds Union was "in the process of
having these removed" when,
"before even deciding to give a for-
mal warning", ICU President Tasha
Newton ordered that the Guilds
Union should be taken straight to a
disciplinary. Contrarily, according to
Ms Newton, the Guilds Union were
regularly told to remove the items for
Dinesh facing the wrath of ICU
two months since the Field Cup took
place at the end of Fresher's Week.
After the items were still not
removed, disciplinary action was
decided to be taken. Despite this,
our source insists that "Previously

there had been 2 verbal requests
(not warnings) from the Deputy Pres-
ident (Clubs & Societies)". Then, out
of the blue, Ms Newton informed the
Guilds President of her decision.
Regarding health and safety,
The ICU Source stated "this mess is
actually no different to the rest of the
state of the Quad" and went on to
say that "if you look at the bottle bins
next to the bike rails at the front of
Beit, you will realise there are bigger
Heath & Safety issues than a bath
tub".
Information from the Source
suggests "the final 'real' decision to
take CGCU to a disciplinary was
raised in a 'behind closed doors'
ICU Exec (where the Guilds Presi-
dent was not present), by which time
the tub and everything else had been
removed".
The ICU Source concludes "ICU
has been abusing its disciplinary
power - there are even rumours that
there is a sweepstake being run of
how many disciplinaries they in get
in a week."
