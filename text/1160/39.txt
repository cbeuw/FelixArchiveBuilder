This was no friendly, with Brunei
still smarting from their defeat
last year. With this in mind, Rod
Hull, the Brunei coach, fielded
his best possible side including a
few first team players, and our
ex-coach Graham the Nonce.
We'll get you next time mate. The
stiff first half wind worked in the
RE. teacher's favour and it was
only monumental work from the
forwards and flashes of inspira-
tion in the backs (Jim R in partic-
ular) that allowed us to lead 1 7 -
1 3 at the break.
They brought on some big fat
bastards at halftime and the sec-
ond half quickly took the form of
one long scrum. This combined

with the wind deserting us
allowed them back into the
game. In the end they scored
some dull tries and despite some
spirited play from us they man-
aged to hold out.
They would have been more
excited with the score but half of
them couldn't count. This thought
(and a party bus on the way
home) made sure the day was
enjoyed by all.

This "friendly" match started off as
a day trip to Cambridge. We did-
n't have a full team due to injuries
but neither did they. We took pity
on them and lent them Beth (well
she had been on a pub crawl the
night before, and wasn't exactly a
picture of good health).
We spent long periods of time
camped in their 22, but they were
defending we!!. Eventually Betsy
broke through to score her first of
four tries. They tried hard for the
next 5 minutes but we broke
through again. Curly Clare con-
verted the try despite it being only
her second place kick ever.
By then we were beginning to
enjoy ourselves and notice odd
things about their players. They
had a hunchback for a wing and
their hooker could have shaped
straight out of St. Trinnians.
After half time we carried on
the way we left off with excellent
handling, rucking and mauling.
They had a scrum on their line
but Emma nicked the ball and Betsy
went over again. More good play
resulted in a try for Ling and then
Betsy's final try.
In the end it was great to breath
some unpolluted country air, kick
some butt and have a great meal
courtesy of Ling's parents.
You will notice on turning the page
that Cross Country have become the
first IC team this year to win a trophy
- retaining the ULU title. It's a shame
that they didn't make more of it with
a bigger report. Submitting it on nice
paper, printed out in colour with big
headlines is nice, but doesn't quite
have the same effect once it has
been typed out. So, when you win,
shout about it, and shout lots!
Which reminds me, next week is
the last issue of 1999, and with
BUSA drawing to a close and some
sports finishing their seasons for
another year, now is the perfect time
to submit a report/review of the year!
Unfortunately I won't be here, so
have a great Christmas and an even
better 2000.
Cheers, Gus
