IC takes BUSA by storm Imperial hits the target
Tenpin Bowling Archery
At last weekend's BUSA Tenpin
Bowling Championships in Not-
tingham, Imperial produced the
best result in years - having three
representatives in the elite ten
men and ten women BUSA team
for 99/00. Coincidentally, we
also have the largest number of
BUSA representatives of any of
the universities present.
Our top woman bowler, Eliz-
abeth Ivory, scorched the lanes
with blistering scores of 201,
209, 181, 189 and 190 en route
to a brilliant 176 average over
nine games. She was ranked third
overall in the ladies section and
easily qualified for the BUSA
team. She was also picked to be
the vice-captain of the BUSA
ladies team for the coming year.
Not to be outdone, our two top
male bowlers - Graham Johnston
and Robert Crosbie - also pro-
duced fantastic games. Rob con-
sistently bowled games of 187,
195, 202, 203 and 197 to aver-
age 191 for the day. With his
excellent debut showing, Rob
came in third overall in the final
standings. Both of them automat-
ically qualified for the BUSA
team. This is an amazing feat
from all three of them consider-
ing that there were about 230
male and 70 female bowlers
present at the championships!

Imperial College vs The World
On Sunday 28th November, the
honourary company of Imperial
College archers set out, bows in
hand, to the darkest suburbs of
Uxbridge and the Brunei University
Open. This incorporated the BUSA
Southern Area Universities and uni-
versity competitions.
Our secret weapon was Leo's
clicker because it managed to
squeak every time she shot - to our
opponents' dismay. We met some
very nice people who chatted lots
and offered bits of advice. There
were several strange Surrey people
who had war paint on and one
guy looked like a raccoon.
The journey there and back
was crap - the tube bounced too
much and yours truly ended up with
a very messy article. Oh, and
Gavin was attacked by an empty
Lucozade bottle.
There were, however, excellent
performances from all archers,
particularly the captain who swept
the board and washed the floor
with everyone else's hair (Well not
quite; silver in BUSA, bronze in the
Universities and 4th in the Open.)
Keith and Ruth managed personal
bests and came 28th and 16th
respectively; Matt and Gavin both
shot wel! to finish joint 33rd and
41 st out of 65 men.
Despite this being the first tour-
nament for all bar the captain, a
thoroughly good time was had by
all and lots of jelly babies were
consumed. (And we didn't have to
get up early either.)
Training takes place every
Monday and Friday at 6pm in the
Sports Centre's Projectile Hal!.
