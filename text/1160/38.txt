QMW VI
IC V
After last week's 12 goal extrava-
ganza against Goldsmiths IV, which
was shared 6-6, we knew we had to
get back on the winning trail against
a mid-table side who had neverthe-
less beaten some good teams.
With many players missing from
the squad, and our keeper once
again called to higher things with
the 4th team, we started the game
rather slowly, conceding an early
goal when a lightning fast break
from the QMW front line outpaced
the defence to slot one home. The
5th team spirit is fast becoming leg-
endary, however, and we didn't let it
phase us, with an equalising goal
coming almost immediately from
the boot of Dino, back on the goal
trail after 2 weeks off. With QMW's
pacey forwards always threatening,
the rest of the half was fairly even -
a great save from stand-in keeper
Andy Pease keeping the score level,
before we took the lead with a 3 rd
goal of the season from Gazza.
In the 2nd half we again started
poorly, letting them score from a
corner with a tap in from inside the
6 yard box. As the half wore on,
though, we began to click into gear
with great work at left back from
Tiger and on the right from Vince. A
cross from the left from Dino then
fell to Spaceman, whose persistence
in a ruck of players saw the ball into
the net from close in to regain the
lead at 3-2. There was no looking
back from there, with Andy in goal
having a great game, and even Dij
and God coming very close to scor-
ing. Dino took the chance of notch-
ing up a second hattrick of the sea-
son, with the third goal a brilliant
curling left foot shot from the edge
of the area. A late debut appear-
ance by Steve from the 7ths was
another bonus from the day, and IC
V's march on.

IC VII 1
Kings VI 4
Our last meeting with the side
currently leading the 6th division
ended in a very heavy defeat, so
we were all really up for this
game. Due to some freak train
delays, we actually got to their
ground half an hour before they
did!
Kings started extremely
aggressively, and we found our-
selves pushed back to our own
half. However, despite the
notable absences of Caprano
and Andy Smith, our defence
held solid. Despite all their pos-
session, Kings only created a
handful of opportunities in the
first 40 minutes. However, they
finally broke through when a
cracking shot took an unfortunate
deflection off the Guvnor (playing
in an unfamiliar left-back role)
and flew past Andy Pease in goal.
We kept our heads up though,
and managed to equalise when
Mark finished superbly off a great
free kick by Leacho.
We started the 2nd half with
our heads up, but they scored
shortly after the re-start from a
good header. We then lost Bar-
ney to injury, and from then on it
was always going to be difficult.
We continued fighting for every
ball, and we were dangerous on
several occasions as the wingers
managed some good counter-
attacks. Longy managed to kick
the bar at one point off a great
cross by Keri! However, as the
half wore on we started to tire,
and they scored two more goals
against our now makeshift
defence.
However, it was a brave and
spirited performance by all of the
IC VII squad, and this result
should bode well for the remain-
der of the season.
IN BRIEF
Crosscountry Boat Club Netball Hockey
We boarded the tube at South
Kensington, and 21 stops later we
reached beautiful Cockfosters -
home of Middlesex University.
Miss Whiplash continued to
dominate the all comers, picking
up her own gold medal, ably
backed up by Louise in 13th. The
woman's team came third overall,
despite not having a third runner.
Imperial provided 10 of the
first 12 men and won the team
championships, with the 'B' team
in second place, easily beating
UCL, King's and Holloway firsts.
Stan-ron was first home, win-
ning a second gold individual
medal to add to his collection. XXX
Gaffer was next in to collect silver,
with the Veteran arriving 4th. Frank
and Stereo-Dan finished joint 5th,
holding hands like the daisies they
are, with Daisy Boy right behind
completing the team.
We left Trent Park confirmed
once again as the undisputed
champions of London. Until next
time boys...
The weekend before last saw the
Imperial College and Queens
Tower Boat clubs romp home to
glory yet again ahead of Oxford
and even the GB Elite squad,
Leander.
The Fours Head has teams
from almost all clubs in the
country taking part, with the start
number for each crew taken from
last year's finishing position. The
ICQT mens coxed four won sen-
ior two, as did the QT men's
quad and the women's coxed
four, the women's coxless four
won the elite level open (the top
level of entry for this regatta).
To put all this in context,
together ICQT won 4 pennants
compared to Oxford, Leander
and Oxford Brokes who each got
two and dozens of other BUSA
and club crews who at best got
one each.
Well rowed IC.
Cross Country win ULU!!

ICSM 18
IC 40
For the first time the sun shined on
IC Netball team as we ventured
down to Teddington. After ogling
the rugby players the match final-
ly started. Everything went well,
with shots flying in from all angles
from our super shooters Sarah
and Shirley. The first quarter
ended with us 8-3 up, a lead we
would not lose. During the (extra
long) second quarter our players
were flying all over the place. In
the centre court Jane, Jess and
Dorothy intercepted nearly every
pass. At half time we were streak-
ing ahead 17-8. Thanks to our
extra stretchy defence, Kirsty and
Kathryn, ICSM scored only 10
more goa!s. Substitute shooter
Rebekah arrived at half time to
dart around the circle scoring
goals at a rate of knots, and the
score was 40 by the end of the
match. Congratulations - still
unbeaten in the Union.
Imperial IV 1
GKT III 1
The fourth team's eternal quest to
field a full side remained unfulfilled,
despite Feminine Geordie leading
by example and squeezing his large
posterior into a keepers kit.
The match began promisingly
as the 10 warriors present scored
an early goal (that's been 2 goals
coming) from the penalty spot, due
to the GKT keeper being intent on
putting "I'm too good for DBs" on
his arse. The second half was not so
impressive - IC milled about in
usual fourths style and conceded a
weak goal. Then the fourths nearly
scored again, but old habits die
hard and the match finished 1-1.
Following his recent yellow streak
and extreme deviant behaviour,
Grease & Groom umpired the
game admirably and managed to
avoid getting involved in a ruck.
Well done that man! Bring on the
ULU cup so we can groove on with
the Diiisco Boys!
