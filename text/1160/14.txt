HERE WE G O AGAIN...
Dear Felix,
First of all I would like to
make it clear this is not an anti-
medics letter, although things do
seem to run smoother around
here when the arrogant and rude
inconsiderates are a few miles of
tarmac away in Charring Cross.
There are many of the opinion
that medics feel superior to every-
one else, but these innocent doc-
tors-to-be aren't to blame. We
fuel this feeling by erecting a new
building for them (including a
room complete with fu(ball and
"The Crystal Maze" arcade
game), we give them the newest
computer facilities in college, we
support all this with a small work-
force of persons in their under-
graduate office. Rather than the
superb duo in the Biology under-
graduate office who run the entire
department and put up with 300
moaning biology students, the
medics reguire 1 5 people working
round the clock to keep the
wheels of the medic machine
oiled and turning. But even this
highly organised outfit trips up
more than occasionally and when
it does it seems to be at the
expense of everyone but them-
selves. A prime example of this
happened just yesterday. It was an
afternoon like any other in the
BMS, some people hard at work,
most getting their daily caffeine
hit in the cafe, and the odd few
students checking their e-mail.
Oh no wait they couldn't
because of a stroke of genius in
computer room management on
the part of the BMS staff. The Biol-
ogy computer room (50 comput-
ers for 300 biologists, the maths
on that is never going to work)
booked for a first year practical, a
medic lab with 26 computers
filled with third year biologists
(who had booked but medic intel
reports claimed they had no
record of this), and a enormous
room with 85 computers
crammed full with 8 students hav-
ing a management lecture that
didn't even require the use of
computers. (Didn't anyone tell
them they had a school of their
own ??) When asked if it would
be possible for a few people to
work quietly in the corner, the fol-
licly challenged lecturer grumbled
a resounding "no." I appreciate
that the medics posses well-
endowed computer facilities, (Just
why they seem to need 1 7inch
monitors when the biologists only
get 15 inches is beyond me,
although it could be due to their
blindness caused by a popular
solo past-time....by that I mean
studying in dim light of course.)
but why do people from the man-
agement school feel the need to
occupy a room filled with comput-
ers when there are countless small
rooms hidden away for that sort of
thing. Another point to make is
the "Lecture in progress, do not
enter" signs that get plastered
almost as frequently as "Vote
Tasha Newton for President." They
are up so often that people now
misread them to say "Computer
room free, anyone welcome" and
just waltz right in no matter what
the situation. Admittedly the biol-
ogists have come up with a
timetable outside the door (we are
still waiting for the medics to
catch on to that one) but a simple
"OCCUPIED/VACANT" slide on
the door would suffice. A meagre
£15 in the £65 million budget
would have alleviated so much
grief from daily student life but
these powers that be don't seem
to get that concept in anything
they do.
Yours sincerely,
Anon

Dear Felix,
Adrian Spankie deserves
applause for raising the issue of
the very poor pay levels in student
unions (Letters, Felix 1159). I
would, of course, support any
attempt to increase pay to a
decent level. However I would
avoid labelling iCU as "hypocriti-
cal". At least we supported the
demo - would it be better if we
didn't support the demo and also
paid lousy wages? Of course not.
Why not write a paper on our low
pay levels for discussion at union
council? You'd get my support.

ERRANT EDITING
Editor,
We would like an official
apology for the "Outdoor Club"
branding that the Canoe Club
received in the last edition of Felix
(29 November. Issue 1159). Not
only does this put us under the
same canopy of Outdoor Cooks
and La La's, but it suddenly
invokes the outrageous idea that
the Outdoor Club might be able
to paddle down one of *our*
rivers. I would suggest they might
be pushed to ramble along one of
the banks.
To then link many cult pad-
dling names to their society, has
done almost irreprable damage.
And when one considers the
membership boost and conse-
quential budgetry raise they may
have enjoyed, perhaps damages
should be sought.
Of course, we don't really
mind, and no offence meant to
the outdoor club who run numer-
ous pleasurable weekends to
enjoy the outdoors in a relaxing
environment. We simply don't
want to confuse punters into turn-
ing up for a paddle, to find them-
selves cooking, or worse still to
sign up for a chill-out weekend,
and find that suddenly they are
flying down a raging river face
down.
So, don't let it happen again,
eh?
Thanks,
Nigel Thacker
