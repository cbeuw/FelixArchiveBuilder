Counting Crows
Hanginaround
(Geffen)
This bouncing, reef-
style, guitar led melody
about the fundamental
principles of life, (ie
just taking it easy),
makes it as single of
the week! I was singing
along after only a cou-
ple of listens. It's excel-
lent and bound to
cheer you up on
rough day. Top dollc
Chris de Burgh
A Woman's Heart
(Mercury)
The sheer fact that this achy-breaky
heart type effort has a 'doo do doo
doo' backing chorus part way
through really only supports the
opinion that Mr de Burgh should be
happy with his past successes and
stay at home and far away from any
recording equipment. Bearable, but
not a good cookie.
Whitney Houston
I Learned from the Best
(Arista)
This, the first track from her plat-
inum album My Love Is Your Love, is
a good effort from one of the most
undisputed powerhouse soul divas
of our time. Full of big notes, with
shady jazz and soul brass under-
tones, this rings out well. Should be
big.

The Dust Brothers
Music from Fight Club
(20th Century Fox)
It's just a novelty
Choose Life from a
hardly ground-break-
ing movie, and consists
of narration to an
underground beat. It
tells of you how your
life means nothing, and
concludes with a repet-
itive 'You have to give
up'. Don't buy it for the
feel-good factor.
Longpigs
The Frank Sonata
(Mother)
The Longpigs have
done some good stuff
in their time and
although this isn't their
best, it's still much bet-
ter than average. Their
recent album is also
worth checking, and
although not the best
album out this year it is
definitely worth a space
in your CD collection.
Memphis Bleekas
What You Think Of
(Def Jam)
Memphis Bleek gets together with
in-form rapper Jay-Z on this joint
so you'd expect this to be quite a
tune. Sadly, however, this is far
from the standard it should be. The
lyrics are dull, the beat is poor and
overall this a tune that is better
best forgotten.
Bryan Adams
The Best of Me
(A&M)
I've never been able to forgive Bryan
Adams for that Satanic sixteen week
reign at number one all those years
ago. The Best of Me is, of course,
another terrible offering and who
could expect anything else from the
husky Canadian. At least there's no
Mel C collaboraton to spoil things
further, and being as kind as possible
I can only describe this as a monot-
onous rock dirge. Please Bryan, go
away
Rico
Shave Your Head
(Chrysalis)
Rico apparently puts on
quite a live perform-
ance and as such I was
expecting much from
this latest single. Once
again though, the lis-
tening leaves me disap-
pointed. This is nothing
more than standard
generic indie rock that
has been done a thou-
sand times before.
What's worse is that it's
also been done a thou-
sand times better.
