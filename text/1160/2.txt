Some noticeabl
Refurbishment at last for Southside
M A N S O O R C H O U D H U R Y
Southside Halls may undergo a
refurbishment this coming summer if
planning permission is received for a
massive remodelling of the building.
Every room in the block (which
presently houses the Falmouth-
Keogh, Selkirk and Tizzard Halls) will
be renovated, with every room set to
be fitted with en-suite bathrooms.
According to the College's long-
term planning and investment analy-
sis, this feature is essential if the Col-
lege hopes to rent rooms during the
vacations for conference attendees.
Other possible improvements to
Southside could lead to an increase
in social space for hall residents and
an improvement in the ratio of stu-
dents to kitchens. The new halls will
be vertical (ie based around a few
eight storey staircases) rather than
horizontal (as is currently the case),
and landings will thus be re-mod-
elled to increase the number of
rooms and cooking facilities.
All this will come at a price,
however - there will probably be an
increase in rent of around £6.50 per
week from the current amount. Stu-
dents could therefore be looking at
a total increase of over £200 per
year for their living expenses.
Ian Clifford, ICU Deputy Presi-
dent (Finance & Services), said
Southside was in genuine need of
refurbishment, as the current build-
ing was never intended to be a per-
manent residence. Mr Clifford fur-
ther noted that "students are more
likely to take care of their hall if it's

new and shiny" and that if the reno-
vation plans do not go ahead,
Southside would probably stay in its
current dilapidated condition for the
next thirty years.
In Brief
DEBT COLLECTORS
CHASE STUDENTS
Middlesex University has chosen to
employ a debt-collecting firm to
obtain unpaid tuition fees in an
action that could set a precedent.
Chase Debt Collectors, Man-
chester, are primarily to pursue any
overseas and post-graduate stu-
dents who default on their fees, but
it is understood that they are to
extract money from undergradu-
ates too. The new scheme has
apparently caused a few adminis-
trative headaches as non-payers
are still allowed to attend classes,
have work marked and sit exams.
C I N E M A D I S C O U N T S
Felix has secured a deal whereby
students will be able to see dis-
counted films at the Kensington
Odeon. The scheme will let stu-
dents watch any film they want for
no more than £4.50 and will be
running from Monday to Friday.
This is a definite improvement on
the deal for students currently run-
ning at Virgin, Fulham Road, which
runs from Monday to Thursday and
costs £5 per film.
This agreement pre-empts a
similar student discount, which has
been arranged by the Union, with
Warner Brothers. This deal current-
ly operates for students with the
NUS, of which IC is famously not a
member. The discount, as it cur-
rently stands, is £3 for any film
every day, excluding the cinemas at
Leicester Square. This discount will
be nation-wide whereas the
Odeon scheme will be restricted to
one cinema only. However, the
Odeon discount will have started
on Friday the 3rd of December
while the Warner Brothers scheme
is still in the production and print-
ing phase. In addition to this, by
getting hold of a booklet from the
Felix office, you can take advan-
tage of various extra offers from
Odeon. See Screen for further
details.
C O U R T S C O S T
ICU societies wishing to use the
tennis courts will now be charged
£5 per hour for the booking of
both courts. The price comes as a
shock to those at IC who have
been used to playing for free. The
College has introduced the new
pricing system, after taking over
management of the courts from the
Union when the courts fell into a
state of disrepair last year. Origi-
nally under Union control, charges
were only made to external users -
for example, schools and the pub-
lic. Tim Trailor, Deputy President
(Clubs and Societies), explained
that in return for lost revenue from
external court bookings, the Col-
lege will pay ICU approximately
£4500 per year - a figure based
on the average taking previously
received from tennis court book-
ings.
After a ten thousand pound
grant from the Harlington Trust to
fund refurbishment of the courts,
they are now up to a reasonably
high standard. It has been suggest-
ed that tennis court revenue might
not be as high as expected, due to
the deterring cost of play. However,
the compensation from College
should ensure that the Union will
not lose out.
B O O K D I S C O U N T S
This Thursday will see Waterstones'
second "Discount Thursday", tar-
geted at soaking up the pre-Christ-
mas market. All books (including
academic text-books) are available
at a 15% reduction on the normal
retail price from every branch in the
London area - including all three
campus branches.
