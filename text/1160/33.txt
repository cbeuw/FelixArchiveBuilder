Your chance to win 007
Well, at least ticket 007 to this
year's Christmas Carnival, to be
held across three floors of the
Union on December 1 7th, the last
day of term.
The carnival this year has a
Bond theme with full Bond decor,
music from the 007 Band and a
different Bond theme in each. So,
you can check out some reggae,
house & garage with the Channel
One Sound System (one of the
Notting Hill Carnival's longest
running and most popular sys-
tems) in the "Live & Let Die
Room", stand the chance to win a
sexy black mountain bike in the
"Casino Royale", or chill out and
relax with martinis in "Pussy
Galore's Cocktail Bar". [Mark,
thou art truly the King of Cheese -
do you really have no shame?
Ed]
There's also music from the
Pop Tart DJs and an opportunity
to live out your Bond fantasies in
17 1239
the laserquest in the Quad. Dress
is strictly Bond, villain or Bond
girl, and there'll be a prize for the
best outfit on the night.
All this costs a mere £007 -
however, you and a friend could
be going for free. To win the much
desired ticket 007, all you have to
do is track back through your
memory or delve into your parents
record collections and name the
artists who recorded the theme
tunes to:
For Your Eyes Only.
The Man with the Golden Gun
From Russia with Love
Live and Let Die
A View to A Kill.
Think that sounds easy? Then
either e-mail your answers to
m.home@ic.ac.uk, or drop your
solutions into the Union Office
before noon on Weds 8th. The
winner will be announced in next
weeks Felix.
Last week's
competition
The winner of last week's cross-
word competition was Rosie Beck-
ett. Congratulations - please
come into the Felix Office ASAP to
pick up your tickets to see Dram-
Soc's excellent production of Dirk,
which is showing from Thursday
this week in the Union Concert
Hall. Don't miss out on what
should be a truly spectacular
show.
Although there isn't a prize for
this week's crossword, next week's
mindbendingly difficult offering
from Turnip Henry will be accom-
panied by a suitably impressive
catch for the winner (I've got Fer-
arri on the phone right now), so
make sure you watch this space
next week. There should also be a
regular prize attached to the
crossword every week next term,
so keep practicing - and, in the
meantime, enjoy...
