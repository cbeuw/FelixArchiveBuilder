The State of the Union
By Tasha Newton, Imperial College Union President
Charing angry
On the last day of November,
over 100 people met to ask ques-
tions about the developments which
made the front of the last issue of
Felix. These were undergrads, post
grads and their teachers all interest-
ed to see how the scheme would
work. Sadly for the powers that be,
most of those who attended were
not born yesterday and there were
many flaws in their plan. Like a two
floor gap between where the refer-
ence texts are kept and the PCs. Or
the fact that the department moving
in actually needs room to expand
which it will not have in these plans.
This was news to those there too -
where will they expand? Further into
the library I guess, as there is noth-
ing else nearby. The quest to try to
get the students and other users of
the library in all this, and to get the
powers that be to realise that they
can't push this mistake through as it
stands, continues. I would like to
see a person from each year and
from each user group involved in
the discussion process - at the
moment there has been a token
offer of two students, who will be
heavily numbered on the commit-
tee.
Warner Brothers
Well done to Felix for their deal
with the local Odeon! The latest
from the new national scheme for
Warner Brothers is that the paper-
work should arrive on my desk this
week, and the cards will be avail-
able from January. The card will
allow you a discount at any Warner
cinema you choose to visit nation-
wide.
Sussex in the club
How appropriate it is that, with
CHESA meeting this weekend, two
colleges may have joined with the
free thinking Universities by the end
of next week - good luck in your
referenda guys. Not that IC has
ever done badly being outside the
NUS, but things would get even
better for us if more Colleges came
on board.
