whose ICaiife?
Well, it was Reuben who won
the competition to name our
exciting new web service (nice
one Reuben), but soon everyone
else gets to play too. And work.
And get better jobs. And buy
stuff cheaper...
Yes, IC4life is a succinct and apt
winning name for our portal,
hinting at the extensive services
that will be offered specially for
Imperial College people.
In fact, no matter who you are,
you'll wonder how you ever
managed without it.
IC4life - it may be Reuben's for
now, but from January 2000 it's
4 everyone else too.
