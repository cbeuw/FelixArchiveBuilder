Library plans outlined Tamil Soc Show Shines

Disagreements surrounding the
proposed refurbishment of the
Reynolds Building at Charing Cross
intensified this week.
At last Tuesday's Vice-Princi-
pal's Question Time, Professor
Michael Whitehouse - ICSM's Vice
Principal (Undergraduate Medicine)
- outlined the current proposals to
an assembled crowd of around a
hundred Charing Cross students.
Amidst suggestions that a decision
has practically been made already,
he (along with project specialist
Peter Griffiths) detailed the results of
a "feasibility study" conducted by
the Med School, which demonstrat-
ed that it would be possible to
squeeze Primary Healthcare and
Social Services into the building, as
long as other services are remod-
elled and reorganised.
Although the study suggests an
alteration in shelf space for medical
journals amounting to a 3 9 %
reduction in the volume of texts
available, Prof Whitehouse prom-
ised that "the existing level of library
service will be protected - it will just
be reconfigured". Part of the stu-
dent common room would also dis-
appear, as would several ICSM
Union rooms (as computing facili-
ties move into the basement).
The driving force behind the
redevelopment would seem to be
the undoubted need for total refur-
bishment of the Charing Cross site.
However, although all parties would
like to see a thorough appraisal of
the building leading to'a redevelop-
ment programme, the potential for
a quick injection of cash from the
introduction of the Primary and
Social units into the building would
seem to have swayed the discussion
dramatically. Prof Whitehouse
explained that the special trustees
would release £2.5 million if the
units can be accommodated.
The big question, however,
remains whether or not students will
be involved in the decision making
process - or whether the crucial
decisions have already been made.
Prof Whitehouse himself refused to
be drawn on the issue, simply stat-
ing that "it's a very important proj-
ect and I'll work very hard to ensure
that it happens".
SUNIL RAO
The ICU International Tamil Soci-
ety annual show was held on Fri-
day 26 November, in the Great
Hall, carrying on in the proud tra-
dition of past shows and events.
This year's event "Sangamam
'99" was billed as a millennium
show, aiming to showcase the tal-
ents of the members of the society
and their friends by "drawing from
both Eastern and Western cul-
tures".
The show finally kicked off
with the traditional lighting of the
lamp and was prefaced by a clas-
sical (Carnatic) music solo. Fol-
lowing a brief welcome speech by
Sutharsan Vivekananthan, Tamil
Soc President, the show began in
earnest with a well-received classi-
cal solo dance performance. Most
of the dances featured in the show
were unsurprisingly set to music
from contemporary Tamil movies.
Then came the first of the two
"fashion show" sections, with a
variety of clothing on display, from
traditional saris to modern
streetwear, all modelled to thump-
ing hip hop sounds. Nearly thirty
different students modelled, show-
casing dresswear from a number
of fashion houses across London.
The best bits - those that got
the crowd really going - came
after the interval, though. A hilari-
ous comedy sketch targeting "The
Jerry Springer Show", but with
Tamil participants instead of the
usual trailer-park trash, elicited a
great reaction from the crowd,
and the closing folk dance
remained (as ever) incredibly pop-
ular, providing a grand finale to
an evening that by and large ran
very smoothly.
This year's show was attended
by almost 350 people, not as
many as last year but still a good
turnout, with the memories of the
drunken brawl outside last year"s
event still fresh in the minds of the
organisers.
The show was, like most of its
kind, a charity event, with pro-
ceeds going to the Tamil Rehabili-
tation Organisation (TRO), a
charity set up to aid Tamils dis-
placed from Sri Lanka owing to
the violence there.
on London
Scotland.
In addition to various speeches
made by politicians and represen-
tatives from the major education
unions, NUS National President
Andrew Pakes also addressed stu-
dents and union members. Mr
Pakes said, "The largest student
protest in a decade proves the
issue of tuition fees will not die. The
march has brought a national
focus to fees, hardship and pay for
students, and we must now put
pressure on MPs locally. This action
will be followed in the Spring at a
lobby of parliament by NUS and
students' unions. It's time that
Government and business put their
hands deep in their pockets and
paid up for a decent and equitable
education system."
UCAS figures indicate that
fees, since their introduction, have
led to a drop in applications - par-
ticularly from mature students
where there has been a drop of 1 0
per cent over the last two years.
Angry NUS fees protesters descend
JIM G E A C H
London's streets were awash with
twelve to fifteen thousand angry
students on Thursday 25th Novem-
ber, all taking part in the NUS
demonstration against tuition fees
and student hardship. Students
from all over the country attended
the march, which was set to be "the
biggest show of student protest in a
decade", organised after a ballot
from union members in July.
ICU President Tasha Newton,
despite her initial hostility to the
idea at October's ICU Council,
thought the demo to be a good
idea, even though the Union is not
part of the NUS, as it tackled prob-
lems that affect all students in high-
er education. Imperial students
were therefore given the option of
attending, and appropriate promo-
tional material was displayed
around College to drum up sup-
port - the demo would be more
successful the more students

attended. Ms Newton's only appre-
hension came from the possible
involvement of IC students in minor
disturbances that occurred after the
event.
Demonstrations began outside
the University of London Union on
Malet Street, then progressed over
Westminster Bridge, culminating in
a mass rally in Kennington Park.
This finale was hosted by the NUS
Scotland president Richard Baker,
who has been a key player in the
Scottish campaign against fees and
is also a member of the Scottish
Independent Committee of Inquiry
into Student Finance which the
NUS has lobbied to scrap fees in
