"East took me high above the tree line
through hairpin bends into disturbing
barrenness"
The light drive to Caracas from La
Gua'ici national airport was
landmarks until we hit the hills
surrounding the capital, these
were smothered in thousands of
tiny flickering lights and I found
myself deceived, missing an
imposing mountain range. The
bewitching fairy lights cresting the
landscape were actually densely
packed brick built shoe box shacks
that spill in their thousands across
the outskirts of the capital.
It was sobering to see, in the
cold light of day, shanty-towns
sprawl under a sky-line of North
American style sky-scrapers. All

selection from the several mini-bus
mountains,
east took me high above the tree
lin#~^hftwign hairpin bends into
disturbing barrenness, west into
J B p p fertile ground where
waterfalls spilled under and over
the road, feeding lush vegetation.
South, then into Canaima, an
expansive National Park spanning
into Brazil. My first view of the
jungle was from a dugout canoe
on the river weaving between
some of the world's oldest rock
formations; weird 'table top' sand-
stone mountains called 'tepuis'
rising above the vegetation. An
almost perfect scenario but
swimming in the river was slightly
marred by every cheesy pirahna
movie I'd ever seen.

and we ended up sitting between
some tower blocks, surrounded by
little boys playing football and a
cloud of wasps. Returning to the
station, the train we had planned
to catch didn't exist, and we had to
make o two hour round trip to get
back - on a train which managed
to catch fire.
On then to another university
town, Valladolid, and subsequently
Burgos which was greener, leafier
and more full of cathedrals than
anywhere we had yet been. From
here it was an overnight train to
Valencia, and then by bus back to
Teruel, which felt like going home.
It was so different to be there as a
visitor: I did no mopping and
looked after no children. We met
friends and swam in the reservoir.
I didn't need to say tadpole or
skipping, but it was just as hard to
say goodbye.

Cairo is a dreadful, smelly,
horrible place. Most people hate
it, but then if you come on a day
trip from Cyprus, you can hardly
expect great cultural insight.

about being up on a high roof

I'm sure the sky wouldn't turn that

The best way to really
appreciate Egypt is by finding a
local to interpret for you. That way
you can get them to translate the
television programmes: there is
quite simply nothing funnier than
Dynasty in Arabic.
When you do make it to the
pyramids, you can spend hours
trying to get that postcard
photograph of the Sphinx, with
Cheops behind, in the middle of
the desert, rather than amid the
urban sprawl. Having battled of
dozens of hardened crooks forcing
a bottle of Nefertiti's own Queen
of the Desert lotus oil perfume
upon you, the final hurdle is to
part with another small fortune
and go inside the great pyramid.
Perhaps I was a little naive to
expect it would be just like Indiana
Jones and the Temple of Doom.

Spain
I'd been to Spain before, as an Au
Pair in Teruel near Valencia. There,
I'd mopped floors six days a week
for six months, learned Spanish
words such as "tadpole" and
"skipping (useful for talking to a
four and a seven-year-old) and
spoke hardly a word of English the
whole time.
Two years later, I went
InterRailing around central Spain
with my brother. We began in
Madrid in 35 degre" heat, staying
with some friends on
the outskirts of the "we had tO take sunbath

we sped back down thevalley,
across the bridge, up the other
side and into the Youth Hostel,
which had no space left for men.
We ended up in a hostal just
off the main square. Toledo was
excellent, one of the important
cities during the civil war, as the
bullet-ridden Alcazar bore witness.
After Toledo we zoomed up to
Aranjuez, supposedly city of
strawberries and the royal train.

I, eager and fresh off the train,
rushed past the other backpackers

other side, and halted in the town
square to consult the guide book.

One evening we took a trip to

that gently radiated the day's heat
at dusk. It was only a half hour
train journey, but upon arrival we
were miles from the town centre,
