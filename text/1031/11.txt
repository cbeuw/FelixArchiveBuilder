In rotation this week, Biochem 1 hot honchos, Michael Calais
and Ben Kemp, play with assorted bits of plastic, and even
manage to say something nice about a couple of them.
In what can only be described as a scary week for all
concerned, Magpie dares to enter the crypt in pursuit of the
d e m o n knight whilst Jenny Ho endures richie rich, a
Macauley Culkin 'vehicle' (stop those hearse jokes now!).
Vile winds back the years with the police - live and tintin
P reviews the new albums from yo la tengo and latimer.
Dave, never one to stay home, gets his ears blown out by the
psyclone rangers.
In the revenge of the indie kids, Vik treats this borrowed
column with an astonishing lack of care as he clubs out at
automatic.
Tintin opens the door on another irregular classic book in the
excellent company of Salman Rushdie's midnight's children;
the mother of all Booker prize winners.

The proprietor rubs his grubby
hands together as another poir
of likely lads make off with the
record industry's single flotsam.
Just wait til they return, hearts
and dreams broken. But alas, it
seems that this week's
rotationees, Michael Calais and
Ben Kemp (Biochem 1) are far
too cynical already. A career in
music journalism awaits...
the cardigans - carnival
single of the week; a song
crafted from everything that
makes you feel good inside; an
instantly memorable chorus,
string laden melodies with
swathes of Hammond organ.

If anyone had ever published an
a-z on how to sound exactly like

tionary new country twist, the
group got it out the library and
kept it until it was long overdue.
kingmaker - the best possible..
Particularly bad indeed. In fact
this isn't even as good as the
guys next door tuning their
guitars and practising bongos.
joy division -
love will tear us apart
This is godlike genius, probably
the most important single of the
week. Unfortunately this group
turned into new order after ian

Tales from the Crypt was originally
a fifties' American comic book but
in the late eighties the Cryptian
ethos turned towards television.
Now the Crypt Keeper has been
awakened once more and one story
has been turned into a film,
demon knight.
Brayker is the hero of the story,
a man forced to defend a boarding
house and its guests against the
Collector and his demons. Why is
the Collector after Brayker? Well,
Brayker has an ancient key, that
can unlock the universe and the
Collector wants it - simple really.
Brayker, however, is only mortal
and his sole weapon against the
Collector is the blood contained
inside this key. Originally if was the
blood from a carpenter - crucified
at Calvary, but each dying keeper
replenishes the key before passing
it on to the next chosen one.
Fortunately Demon Knight
does not become an Alienesque
killing demon scenario or a Friday
the 13th. It's a film full of excellent
ideas. However close attention
needs to be paid to avoid confusion
in some scenes, as you may start
asking yourself, how could that
happen?
Collector Billy Zone is
charismatic throughout the film, a
fact that allows his character to
seduce all the boarding house
guests in the attempt to retrieve the
key. His character is very much
along the lines of Beetlejuice
(comically frustrated) and the Joker
(the devil with a big smile), which
proves to be effective.
Demon Knight is not
particularly scary; there is less
shock and more special effects
demon knight
gore, perhaps in an attempt to
make some people feel a tiny bit
nauseous. Whatever nausea soon
passes though, and being spoon
fed small doses of black comedy
also helps. Demon Knight is high
on the impressive list.
richie rich (Macauley Culkin)
is the richest kid in the world; the
sole heir to a $70 billion fortune.
Not only does he have his own
personal baseball coach, but he
also has a roller coaster in his
backyard and his aerobics instructor
is Claudia Schiffer.
But Lawrence Van Dough is the
villain of the film. He wants to
eliminate the Rich family so that he
can take over Rich Industries.
Mysteriously, Richie's parents go
missing leaving Richie in charge. To
defeat Van Dough, he seeks the
help of a group of city kids who
befriend him.
As a Macauley Culkin film,
Richie Rich is predictable. It's very
much in the same vein as his other
films with plenty of slapstick
humour and Macauley Culkin
attempting to save the day.
However it also has vomit-
inducingly sentimental undertones
with the moral of the story being
that true friendship should be
valued more than money.
Undoubtedly Richie Rich is by
far inferior to Home Alone and
Uncle Buck, the main problem
being that Culkin's cuteness is
rapidly diminishing. But as the idea
of being the richest kid in the world
is every child's dream, it will
probably be readily lapped up by
the pre-pre-pubescent audience.
Adults, on the other hand will find
it a silly but harmless film, which is
mildly amusing in places and just
about bearable. Q
