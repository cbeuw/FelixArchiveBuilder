watching the sun rise in Germany,
our arrival in Prague was sensed in a
state of intense ennui and painful
clarity. There was a tense silence as
we drifted past the c r u m b l i n g
concrete factories i n t o the
d i l a p i d a t e d bus
station, each pas-
senger fearing they
had made a terrible
mistake but unable
to face the stupen-
dous deflation o f
admitting it. We left
the coach, got our currency (you
cannot buy Kronas i n England so
take pounds) and flopped onto a
patch of grass by a tiny food van. We
had arrived.
We had, however, seen only
the worst of what the city had to
offer. Things looked up when we
found a fantastic campsite, a small
place r u n by a
friendly y o u n g
man who gave us a
discount and had
fruit trees and cats.

Prague's public transport system is
excellent, costing 6Kcs (~13p) to go
anywhere at any time o n bus, tram
or underground. C a m p i n g is the
best o p t i o n as hostels are over
crowded and have strange rules.
I don't remember our first trip
to the centre, except o u r stupid
attempts to pay the tram driver.

Ecuador
I recently worked on a four month
expedition to Ecuador in South
America. The country crosses the
equator and that is what gives it its
name. We raised most of the
money for the expedition from
grant-giving bodies such as The
Imperial College Exploration Board
and The Royal Geographic Society,
as well as through personal
contributions.
The capital city is Quito. It lies
along a valley, surrounded by
mountains. The houses extend up
the mountain slopes. In one town
that I visited there was a house on
the top of a hill, with farmland all
around it stretching down the hill.
Ploughing is done using oxen and
may be on slopes that are at forty-
five degrees to the horizontal.
Quito is the second highest capital
city in the world at about 2400m
above sea level. We were there
from the end of September to the
end of January this year.
Most days the sunshine was
hot and bright, and it usually
rained in the early afternoon at
about two or three pm local time.
There were many bars and discos
with chart music or salsa and even
a hippy pub called "Pobre diablo"
(The Poor Devil) with candles and
relaxing blue walls where you
could drink some great cocktails.
Generally only South
HJ9 F E L I X
American music is heard on the
radio and in the buses and houses.
They drink rum and coke, or beer
or if you befriend the locals they
will give you some of their punto
which is a very strong spirit that
they flavour with cinnamon or
liquorice (it is actually quite tasty
and potent enough that the flavour
soon becomes unimportant).
In Quito the buses have a tv
and video, so that you can watch
the news as you travel through the
town. I was very lucky because I
went with a
couple of
p e o p l e ^°frjendly to women and it
usually obvious that you are a
foreigner. There are jumpers,
ponchos, shirts, hammocks and
bags and other artesanias, few of
JMtfairh the locals wear or use.
We had
"the men are often very jabs before
|ye went. You
had been J
' ' " can find out
there before, could he daunting to a which jabs
knew what it woman on her own" you should
was like and have for a trip
where to go, and we already had from the college health centre or
friends there. They also guide*
to the safer parts of town. The
people were very friendly,
although the men are often
friendly to women and It could be
daunting to a woman on her own,
if she was unsure where sn|f|l|as
going.
People do get mugged,
particularly if they are carrying a
camera or have been seen to pull
out an inflated wallet. The wages
there are a great deal lower than
in the West and even if you do not
think that you appear rich, it is
British Ainways travel bureaus.
Money went further in the
south of the country where prices
were half that of Quito and there
are fewer foreigners. You could
get a meal for about £2 in Quito
and £1 in the south.
Best memory/souvenir: There
are too many good memories such
as learning to salsa, swimming in
a tropical river on Christmas Day
and discovering Quito's laund-
rette; a large room full of women
and about fifty sinks!

T i m e for a little o f the C z e c h
Republic's history:
/J zechoslovakia was formed
Ifc^ shortly after the first World
War b y g l u i n g together three
s m a l l e r states, a n d was u n d e r
Russian c o m m u n i s t c o n t r o l by
1945. It t h e n drifted a l o n g an
i n o r e x i b l e path o f c o r r u p t i o n
leading to the installation of a tin
pot dictator. However, the country
did not fare as badly as it might
have, r e c e i v i n g useful Russian
attention in the capital (such as the
subway) a n d little interference
elsewhere. Being by definition a
Bohemian lot, Prague's population,
especially the young, eventually
made a bid for independence.
They held an all out strike and
vigil in Wenceslaus Square for days
u n t i l the capital was paralysed.
Vaclav Havel, a political prisoner
and plagwright, was installed as
president and the communist rule
was overthrown incredibly peace-
fully in what is now known as the
Velvet Revolution. It separated back
i n t o S l o v a k i a a n d the C z e c h
Republic.
The capital today is i n a fine
position, with a liberal and wise
government, a good infrastructure,
an artistic attitude a n d a happy
populace. T h e change so far has
been encouraging, a careful balance
between pleasure and tackyness,
between growth and burgeoning
expansion.

Hitching in France
Hitchhiking is dangerous, make
mistake! Before you even considejjjf
it find a partner and make the
following three mental checks (1)
you're both insane, (2) you have •
no responsibilities (and neither of
you are in the process of some
major relationship crisis), and (3)
you can swing a good right hook!
Right, once you've decide
where you're going, pack a back-
pack full of clean underwear, get a
map and go! At least, that's what I
did. And try to stay in your pair, it's
safer. We didn't. I started out from
Paris, with one week in hand and
the aim to go south to La Rochelle
and then back north to the famous
island abbey of Mont Saint Michel,

Because tft iaid-

is a bit tricky! Stiff,! did.
It took a while to understand
that the people waving at me were
trying to signal that the back seats

find my luck was in again! I
ipeveloped a strange kind of trust
M h e n travelling a long distance
jpith people I met while hitching;
jlj'S not anything profound, but it
did rekindle some faith in
Humanity. One moment you could
• n d youi ;elf abandoned in the
middle o* nowhere, having just
llealised rou dropped your camera
on your last hitch (yes, with all
those piLcious photos!) feeling
jpuly stupid, when it begins to rain!
l|nd the i ext enjoying the native
hospitality. Hitching takes a care-
free spirit, guts and a sense of
adventure, not to mention a
fundamental belief in the
generosity of the local populace. I
managed to complete my route
with a day to spare - I like to think
that was good planning... But
choose your country wisely!
David Cohen
Anyway, enough of the politics,
what is there to do in Prague?
1 Eat. There are many restaurants
and even the best are affordable.
Czechs take their m a i n meal at
lunch times and some restaurants
are a little reluctant to serve large
evening meals. Tasty three course
set menus can be had for around 66
Kcs, as we d i s c o v e r e d w h e n w e
asked the waiter for three menus.
Prague has a few McDonalds, but if
you go in them I'll never talk to you
again. Fast snacks are available from
vans dotted around — Hamburgers
are made o f ham and served with
Sauerkraut and ketchup. They are
d e l i c i o u s , a n d cost just 18 K c s
(~35p). Pareck is a huge sausage
served with chunks
of bread a n d
mustard and is even
cheaper.
2 Drink. Prague had
the best lager in the
world, Budvar, being
the home of Pilsner (invented i n
Piltzen). The beer comes i n two
shots o f a sweet hazelnut liqueur
called Becherovka. F o r diehards,
G u i n n e s s is available i n the
Highlander Jazz Club, Narodni 28.
Prague has several

meten to twzfere" then brought by
waiters w h o cal-
culate your bill by tallying them on
a beer mat then multiplying it by a
types, light a n d dark. B o t h are
excellent, and are often served with
random number. All drinks are very
cheap.
3 Idle. This is a n h o n o u r a b l e
tradition. Wander around the street
markets, sit i n cafes reading Kafka
( C z e c h ' s most famous author),
listen to buskers.
4 Culture. The place is steeped in it.
It has several o l d opera houses, a
huge a n d fantastic castle, Cubist
villas a n d many churches a n d
museums.
5 Nightlife. There is plenty going on
after dark, centred o n Wenceslaus
Square and Narodni. Prague has a
strong Jazz tradition and many night
clubs and discos have sprung up.
The best places w e f o u n d were
Highlander Blue Note, Narodni 28
for jazz and blues and Bunkr and
L o d e k a 2, a large u n d e r g r o u n d
dance venue.
Bad experiences were fairly
few. Taxi drivers are to be avoided,
they are incredibly expensive and
unnecessary. The state campsite is
not u p to m u c h . A v o i d the
supermarket, it is a d e p r e s s i n g
experience. Soft drugs are i n short
supply and oh yes, don't get caught
crossing a tram bridge when a tram
is coming.
