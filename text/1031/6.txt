Germany
It seems obvious to me that I
should write about holidaying in
Germany, as this is the only
country whose language I have
studied, albeit to a pathetic D at
GCSE level. Unfortunately this
meant that the only phrase I could
recall was "When does the next
train to Koln leave?" and as I was
travelling by car, I did not even get
to use this carefully memorised
query.
However, accompanied by a
good 'German-for-tourists' hand-
book, it is possible to bluff your
way through and if you fail then

Germans are
distressingly
good at
English. In fact,
with the exce-
ption of restau-
rant waiters, it
seems that the
whole country
can speak
English, and will try to do so as
soon as they realise you are not a
native.
Most people will find that
German food is very acceptable,
even delicious at times, but this
does not apply to me, as 1 am a
vegetarian. Attempting to get a
decent meal without meat in
Germany is akin to trying to find a
virgin in King's Cross. At one point
I asked for a green salad (the
method by which I survived in five
other European countries) but even
F E L I X
then the salad contained tiny
chopped up bits of some dead
animal. In the end I survived on
bread and cheese, two foods
which - even in Germany - do not
usually contain meat.

this area Germany excels as it is a

A final word of warning for
any trendy would-be travellers;
Doe Martins are not appreciated in
Germany. They may be cool over
here, but you will be regarded as a
Nazi-loving Fascist if you wear
them, as they hold too many bad
memories.

Going Nowhere
People say that travel expands the
mind... I disagree. I have not been
away for four, maybe five years
now. There are, of course, many
excuses I could thr . * around to
explain this; lack of money, lack of
time (I spent my free time earning
money), even sheer laziness But
the real reason is that \ haven't
really wanted to go I wouldn t
exactly say that I haven't travelled,
but all of the journeying I have
done was tbrou ih the realm of the
mind. There is so much to discover
within myself before I even think
about travelling physically.
Any journey through life is a
journey through the Self, a trip of
discovery. If you
