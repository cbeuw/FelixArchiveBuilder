right that's hi I can't go on. Bloody tele, I never watch It anyway, How am I sup-
posed to review stuff I haven't seen and never want to watch? Do I put in stuff
that I might enjoy or stuff that will be popular? If I put in popular stuff how can I
justify recommending programs I dislike? In fact how can I recommend any
thing when I never watch any TV? Arghhhh!

Week
Volet
Meaning: Being the
third part of the
Triptych.
Triptych
Meaning: Set of three
associated figuratives,
such as chiaroscuros.
Chiaroscuro
Meaning: Technique
incorporating grisaille.
Grisaille
Meaning: Religious
style eminent in fenes-
trations and volets.
Example: The Rector's
somewhat grisaille
chariscuros were found
to be superfluous to a
volet being four in
number and not hinged
in the manner of a trip-
tych. This was not a
concern to Sandy,
though, whose figura-
tives were highly emi-
nent.
