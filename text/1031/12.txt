Standby
old coppers and yanks
It's exam season and I need an
escape - something to steer my
sieve-like mind away from the de
rigeur stress - R - us look that
accompanies this time of year. Oh,
what's this? It's the early '80s and
the police are live! in america.
Sting is disarmingly free of
pretension, Stuart Copeland is not
writing film scores and Andy
Summers is as anonymous and
extremely old as usual. I can take
in the profound social and political
commentary that is 'de do do do,'
de da da da' and while away my
time pondering its significance. I
can chuckle at the pseudo-
reggaisms of 'roxanne' (but enjoy
it all the same) and cast a nostalgic
ear back to the perennial classics of
'don't stand so close to me', 'so
lonely', 'message in a bottle' and
best of all, 'every breath you take'.
Hey, this isn't bad - they knew how
to get a crowd going and in those
days the only stress I had came
from worrying whether Optimus
Prime was going to recover from
his near fatal clash with Megatron.
Maybe they should reform so that I
can be forever sentimental. Then
again, why should they when Sting
can write manifestly inferior tosh
and earn copiously greater
quantities of cash? Like exams,
some injustices never go away. (6)
Situated in the armpit of
Camden Town's trendy anatomy,
the Laurel Tree pub is a haven for
those in the know. Owain assured
me that "that's where Blur hang-
out", so I was rife with excitement!
After a 15 minute brainstorm trying
to remember what the street was
called, we arrive. But Blur? Blah!
Upstairs at the Laurel Tree is a
room the size of yer average
double-bedroom. Still it was where
the psyclone rangers make their
debut London appearance.
My ears were feeling quite
cathedral thanks to the supports,
but that wasn't a problem; the
rangers decided to go one notch
higher. Not a band for the faint
hearted. Jonathan Valania (lead
guy) conceded they were not a hip
grunge band from Texas (actually
Allentown, Pennsylvania?), and
then kicked into 'feel nice', their
first single released back in 1993.
The set also includes tributes to;
Dick Dale - "Dick Dale, Dick Dale,
Dick Dale, Dick Dale!", bassist P.R
Behler's Father (for his tips on
British girls, chocolate and plastic
gloves), and a quick word from
their sponsors, Honeycombs
breakfast cereal, who have been
replaced by Kellogs in the UK.
Far from making some huge
statement about modern society,
the Psyclone Rangers are simply out
to do what they want. Like Valania
said, "one day you wake up and
realise you don't want a Merc and
a condo in the suburbs, then it's
time to say 'f*k it!' and just go for
what you really want".
There seems to be some
confusion on this one; is electr-o-
pura y o la tengo's seventh or
eighth album? Not one for the faint
hearted I'm sure you'll agree. What
is certain though, is that Yo La
Tengo have been around for a
long, long time with little of the
recognition that some would
suggest has been their due.
But it is slowly changing,
particularly after the warming,
storming tsunami of an album that
was 1993's 'painful'. Now 'electr-
o-pura' sees a louder band getting
scuzzalled in form and function.
Ira Kaplan's voice still drones,
Georgia Hubley occasionally takes
vocal control with shy confidence,
but the group's driving force
remains their love of some good
guitar reverberation and semi-
inane odd-ball attitude that
provides us with a running
commentary of the album on the
sleeve notes. And as far as they
may seem to head into Sonic Youth
country, Yo La Tengo never end up
alienating or attempting to spook
their audience with art school
angst.
As they write about their
current single, 'torn courtenay' - "a
group is like a jig-saw puzzle,
everything must fit into the
groove". 'Electr-o-pura' has no
missing pieces. (9)

And if that isn t enough partying for you, why not ry club X at the
Astoria, Tottenham Court Road. You can stilt sfetfri buton o dancefloor
more the size of a rather big envelope than a pos stamp and, yes,
you still get your selection of swinging tunes, but th is time an two
floors. It costs a bit more {a hefty £ 6 with a ffyer Sb«§ you con get by
writing to P.O.Box 3 7 5 7 , N W 6 3 N A ) bllHhft rtOVftlfy tr is time is that it
runs once a month on a Saturday evening from 11 p.rt
That's right, it's a once in a monthtimt -ice that meant
you wont get up for college for the whole of the follow
inaweek...O
Even more chaos is created by
latimer; a band who have chosen
to called their album, Ip title.
Maybe it's supposed to be
something to do with simplicity but
more likely it's the desire to force
that breed of infidel dogs, music
journalists, into forced errors.
Whatever, Latimer come screaming
from the best traditions of the
heartland of American psychobilly-
and-spit rock.
At their most reprobate they're
reminiscent of the ten gallon
swagger of the Supersuckers and
they have toured with the awesome
Rev Horton Heat. Yet they also
display some surprisingly melodic
leanings, as most particularly
realised on the elegantly named
'chicken the goon'.
Still you shouldn't expect an
easy ride on 'Ip title'. It's oily, wily,
pig-headed and not always a
pleasure to know. (7) ©
portend
Within its own retrospect there's
always going to be a question
marked hanging over midnight's
c h i l d r e n . Which, in a literacy
sense is extremely strange as it
come highly recommended.
Winner of the Booker Prize in the
year it was first published,
1 981,'Midnight's Children' has
since^won the 25th anniversary
award as the best Booker Prize
Winner. Yet the question mark
remains, Salman Rushdie?
But leaving that aside, at least
for this short column, 'Midnight's
Children' is a book of rare insight
and depth. Loosely autobio-
graphical in respect to growing up
in Bombay and then Karachi,
'Midnight's Children' is in actuality
far broader - the history of an
entire subcontinent wrapped up in
the brief span of four hundred and
sixty three pages.
And yet the amazing thing is
that it works on both these two
levels, macro and micro, as they,
in turn, work together and apart.
The currents of an independent
India, breaking into Pakistan and
Bangladesh, and the labyrinthian
roots of its politics, shape a family
just as the members of that family
shape countries by their actions,
thoughts and most bizarrely,
physique.
It would be wrong to limit the
work to the East though.
'Midnight's Children' has as much
relevance to western ideas of
citizenship and state as to the
green chutney munching fraternity
of the Bombay middle-class. It's
also dazzling read. O
