Contract
BY T H E N E W S T E A M
Loweth Limited have vigorously
refuted suggestions, previously
reported in F E L I X 1029, that
they had 'lost' their contract with
Imperial College. The company,
whose contract expires at the end
of July, insist that in early April
they themselves made the
decision to pull out of IC, before
the contract came up for review
at the end of this academic year.
Ron Jeeves, IC Operations
Manager, has acknowledged that
Loweth told him that they did
not want to renew the contract,
and that they claimed 'Imperial
College is an impossible place to
work.' But senior estate managers
stand by his allegation that work-
manship was of an unacceptable
standard. " A l l of these problems
have come about because of their
inability to get the quality right,"
Jeeves said.
Loweth point to a recent IC
audit of their work which found a
92% satisfactory rating. They
further assert that the question of
('Grass' continuesfrom page one)
issue that college should perhaps
deal with more coherently than
they have done." He and senior
college tutors w i l l attend a
seminar organised by the C V C P
this month on the role of
university disciplinaries. "In the
light of this discussion, we will
consider whether we need to
make any changes to college
policy," he said.
M r B r i l e y called for a
clampdown on college policy, so
that if any student is found in
possession of drugs, the police
will be informed. He acknow-
ledged that the police would be
unlikely to deal with small time
offenders, but said that the local
constabulary were concerned
about the scale of the problem at
Imperial. Last week there were
more drugs related incidents at
IC than i n all of the rest of
Knightsbridge. M r Briley
emphasised the gravity with
which he views IC's drug
problem in comparison to other
current security issues. "I think
it's serious. In the end,
computers are just computers,
but drugs is people," he said.

Conflicts
the quality of their work was only
brought up after Loweth's
decision to leave IC became
known, and that the letter from
College confirming Loweth's
departure does not even mention
quality. In response, M r Jeeves
said that the quarterly Imperial
College quality audit showed a
10% failure rate in November,
rising to 15% in February, while
an internal audit i n M a r c h
showed that out of twelve jobs
assessed, four were deemed to
have been unsatisfactory.
He insisted that L o w e t h
were informed of problems with
the quality of their work and
showed F E L I X minutes of a
meeting held at the beginning of
March. The minutes record that
'the quality audit has revealed an
increase i n the rate of failures
which has risen to 15%'. The
meeting was attended by three
L o w e t h representatives. "We
made a commitment to quality
control - we never actually
achieved that with Loweth", Ron
Jeeves said.
B Y R A C H E L W A L T E R S
The Huxley building has been
burgled twice in the past week.
Last Thursday night, thieves
broke into the Physics Depart-
ment through a window on the
third floor, stealing four memory
chips from the second year
teaching laboratories. They went
through several rooms, damaging
eight computers during the raid.
Two first year students have lost
three weeks of project work due
to damage inflicted to a work
station disk drive.
Terry Briley, Deputy Head
of Security, described the robbers
as being 'far more subtle than our
proper thieves ... there was no
kicking doors in'. Gaining access
through the windows, they left
the scene of entry as they found
it. "Someone knows what's going
on," M r Briley said.
Steve Cleverly, the tech-
nician in charge of the second
year labs, said the there was a
growing problem i n imple-
menting security in the depart-
Loweth also cite political
and personal conflicts. Earlier
this year Ron Jeeves is alleged to
have attempted to have the
Chairman of Loweth brought out
of an important meeting to
discuss a problem at Imperial.
The IC Operations Manager is
then alleged to have described
the company as 'crap' and
suggested that he would like to
'wring the neck' of the Chairman,
M r Stuart Redcliffe.
The 113 year old company
does not rule out the possibility
of working with IC in the future,
with their Managing Director
saying that they 'would love to be
involved' in future developments.
They are anxious to repair what
they see as the 'slight on our
reputation', with Stuart Redcliffe
insisting his company 'believes
in values' and is 'nothing like as
bad as we've been painted'.
At the same time, N i c k
Black, IC's Estates Manager,
defended R o n Jeeves' record.
"We should have hired someone
like Ron 10 years ago," he said.
ment. "It's a trade off between
keeping things locked up and
giving students access," he said.
Meanwhile i n a separate
incident, staff are confused as to
how two M a c i n t o s h Classic
computers went missing from a
locked room sometime between
Tuesday afternoon and Wed-
nesday lunchtime.
The Physics Department is
continuing to review its security
policy. "They're making the
place like Fort K n o x , " one
security guard commented. The
Computing Department side of
the Huxley building has been
free from thefts since the
installation of infra-red detectors
earlier this month, but the
Physics Department is not
equipped with the sensors.
The man arrested on
E x h i b i t i o n Road i n A p r i l for
thefts from the Huxley building
over the Easter holiday was
charged and released on bail last
Friday. That evening, he was re-
arrested, having been caught
breaking into a car.

Brief
Beyond Wye College
The loose federal structure of the
University of London looks set
to become even more dispersed.
Malaysia College, a new London
University college based at
Kuala Lumpur, will be privately
sponsored and have a student
population of over 5000.
A recent report by the
projects p l a n n i n g committee
suggests that fees will be around
80% of those charged in London,
with the additional benefits of
greatly reduced travel costs.
Imperial has a large number of
Malaysian students regularly
making the pilgrimage each term
to the United Kingdom.
Malaysia College would be
required to adhere to the
standards set by the University
of London. The U L U building,
in Malet Street, is not expected
to consider an expansion of
facilities i f the proposal is
implemented.
Top Spot for Chemical Guide
John Emsley, science writer-in-
residence at the Department of
Chemistry, Imperial College, has
won the Rhone-Poulenc prize for
science books. M r Emsley
collected Â£10, 000 for 'The
Consumer's Good Chemical
Guide' and is the seventh winner
of the prize.
Pubs and Clubs
Young adults go to clubs and
pubs to socialise, not get drunk.
That's the findings of a new
study by researchers at New-
castle University. The loss of
traditional job structures and
consequent trend against early
marriage has led to a culture
where going out may continue
u n t i l the 20's or 30's. Thus,
social life has turned into the
modern equivalent of the
community. Project leader
Robert Holland told the T H E S
that: "people assume it's a
problem to be contained rather
than an a positive opportunity."
Mascots Inviolate
The two remaining violate
mascots of the City & Guilds
College Union became inviolate
on Thursday. A n y attempt to
obtain the mascots- will now be
regarded as theft and w i l l be
dealt with by the police.
