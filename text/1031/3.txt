Travel Special
L e a v e t h i s C i t y
When Jack Kerouac wrote ' O n
the Road' he redefined a feeling
that, despite the press spin at the
time, is probably as old as man
itself. We are wanderers: our vast
spread across the planet is
probably as much an indication
of the need to move as of that for
space to live and stand still in.
And those weary levi'd travellers
of America's fifties share much in
common with the hordes of
backpackers that shift across the
planet like locusts, devouring
culture and spending dollars.
Everyone is looking for the

disappointment can only follow
the excitement of the road.
A g a i n , the bohemian leaving
Prague or Bali is only a little
removed from the silence i n a
family car d r i v i n g back from
Heathrow after two weeks in the
South of Spain. Anyone who
finds his happiness walking to
the greener grass will never smile
over the final pasture.
A n d so to this issue. We
decided that, rather than attempt
to provide an all-too-slight
overview of travel options and
ticket prices, we would present
insiead experiences. Individual
'postcards' that, we hope, might
l u s i in you or, better, to lake a
vague already present notion and
spui 11 into action.
The selection of articles are
are a reflection oi the feelings
they inspired in those who went
to ihem. As such, I hope they
provide a brief insight into ihe
surprising how easy it was to get
people to write about their
favourite destinations, it was
astonishing how many of them
wanted to simply return to the
same place again.
As for my own voyages,
nothing"prepared me for my
modest escape last summer.
Despite being born in Australia
(emigrating at nine) my family,
has in the main, led a land locked
existence. In fact, I could never
really understand ihe concept ol
8:w.: that
there were places where people
spoke differently to us, but the
strange language of Chaucer and
electromagnet waves seemed far
more down to earth.
It was only when my plane
disgorged me at Charles de
Gaulle ihat I realised there really
were other lands and other
peoples. They say that travel
expands the m i n d ; ihe vast
diversity ol human culture was
instantly forced upon me and my
world view changed. I ran about
the airport and the metro looking
at words in French, amazed that
they meant something to the
people around me. And then, less
obviously I met some French
people and found them, cornily,
not that different from myself.
A n alien and unknown city,
the helplessness of a divorcement
from language, the solid reality of
hitherto mythical places like the
Louvre and the the Seine - they
in turn made the whole world
seem real in some way. Behind
every postcard now there is a real
place, with a million intersecting
life-lines crisscrossing via the
mail and the aeroplane.
iiS; I know now that I must travel
!|il4 see something of the world,
but my greatest fear is of
, the vacuous country-
iio drinks McShakes
from Peru lo Portugal. I hate the
r its own sake; it
•st. But
as I ponder trips I know too that
that's my only reason for going.
