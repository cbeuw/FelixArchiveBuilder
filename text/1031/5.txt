Bali
Bali is bonus land: we got the view
of rice paddies falling away into
the valley as we ate our fresh fruit
breakfast in the open air resturant;
the tame baby heron which stalked
between the tables as we ordered
our lunch on Monkey Forest Road,
and the climate, so friendly to
artists, lizards, orchids, frogs,
ducks, hawkers, surfers and us.
The Indonesian island of Bali
floats in the southern Pacific, two
hours from Singapore by plane, on
the other side of the equator. We
chose Air France and thought we'd
picked well - the bag of in-flight
goodies under the seats in front
contained toffees and games
cartridges. Later, realising the
bags belonged to the children
sitting in the seats, we guiltily
replaced them, sans toffees.
"We atefishfresh
from the lake and
persuaded ourselves
that seeing dawn
from the top of the
volcano would be
worth the climb"
Landing at Kuta beach at t le
south': end of tlw island, wo found
a taxi and got stuck in a huge
traffi. int. It
gav us a chance to watch the
Australian surfers on one side of
the road and the restaurants on
the other, and wonder whet' er the
rest o* Bull was like this
We made our escape to
Denpasa*, the capital stown, the
next day Were the hawkers were
incredible, making you feel guilty
for not stopping, then guilty for not
wanting to buy anything, then
guilty for haggling, and finally
guilty for paying what was
probably far too much for
something you didn't really want. .
In Ubud, the artistic central
region of Bali, we ate nasi goreng
in one restaurant ranged down the
side of a gorge and in another
surrounding a pool covered in
lotus. The galleries were full of
vivid black-outlined green and red
paintings of men and women
working in the rice paddies
culitvated on every sloping surface.
We met one elderly Spanish artist
sitting in his gallery: something of
a shock, as from the sign outside I
had thought that the establishment
was a memorial to someone long
dead. He talked about his recent
meeting with Michael Jackson in
Singapore with peculiar excite-
ment.
We took a bemo - local
transport - north to Penelokan at
the foot of Mount Batur, the
remaining active volcano around a
much larger crater now filled by a
lake. We ate fish fresh from the
lake and persuaded ourselves that
seeing dawn from the top of the
volcano would be worth the climb.
Next morning at 3.30am,
Made, our local guide, arrived and
we and the two Germans who
were also making the ascent
struggled to the foot of the
mountain. The honeycomb rock
was loose and very sharp, and
Made, the shortest and lightest of
the party, dragged me up the
steep places. Two and a half hours
of climbing found us at the top,
watching the sunrise, eating eggs
boiled in volcanic steam, and
congratulating each other. We
bought some Coke from a friend
of Mode's who had apparently run
up the mountain behind us
wearing flip flops.
On the way back to Kuta we
drove along roads now fringed
with pejong poles, long bamboos
from which hung flowers and
woven offerings. The dashboard of
the bemo displayed pink flowers
and a little tray of joss sticks. Kites
flew in the distance: it was a day
of celebration.
We left Bali knowing that
we'd have to go back. My
photographs are filled with rice
paddies and sun which spills out
every rainy English day that I open
the album.

South Africa
If you want a real adventure
holiday why not try South Africa. I
did and loved every bit of it. I
stayed there for three weeks with a
friend from College: if you intend
to see all of it you definitely need
more time. We hired a car in the
first two weeks and drove a total
distance of three thousand miles,
much to the hire company's
horror. The last week was spent on
Safari in South Africa's famed
Kruger National Park.
Our first stop in South Africa
was Jan Smuts Airport and it didn't
take long to find our bearings, sort
out a car and a place to stay. The
tourist industry in South Africa is a
little immature but because of this
all the tourist businesses are very
friendly and helpful.
Johannesburg is not a city for
the timid. It has the highest
murder rate in the world but this
didn't stop us checking out the
night life. Caesar's Palace was our
first sample of South African
culture and we were very imp-
ressed. For the price of pizza in
London, we got our entry tickets
and unlimited free food.
Everything seemed so cheap. One
pound goes a long way and,
despite the price of the air ticket,
the holiday turned out to be a bit
of a bargain. Now that apartheid
has gone one would think that it
would now be all fair share but it
was noticeable that there was not
one black in Caesar's Palace. A
quick dash for the car stopped our
wallets being pinched.
South Africa has still got a
long way to go before it can claim
it is a racially equal society. The
general attitudes of both whites
and blacks seemed like an
apartheid still existed. For this
reason we spent most of our time
associating with the whites. It
seemed that if you :|#re BritjjK§
and supported Mam hester United
ypu had an instant fr-
more FA coverage in South Africa
then we get in England!
It didn't take long to realise
Johannesburg didn't have every-
thing so we set off down the N3
toward Durban, Over the eight
hour drive 1
l e climate changed
from a dry war,
day to an i -tremely humid, hot
sub-tropic type climate DurbWWs
a beautiful city and the beaches
are marvellous. We spent the next
week and a half driving down the
'Garden Route'. This route takes
you through many black
independent states (now a part of
South Africa) and finding camp
sites near the beach was easy. The
beaches were deserted and
breathtakingly beautiful and we
certainty were in paradise. The
end of the first two weeks was
drawing too close too quickly.
Drifters Adventure Holidays
supplied us with entertainment for
the last week. We started from
Johannesburg and travelled
through the Eastern Transvaal
visiting a few historic landmarks.
Our real adventure began at
Kruger National Park. We spent
our nights in rustic camps and the
day was spent tracking the 'big
five' either by foot or by Land
Rover. We were lucky enough to
see something very rare on our
safari, a lion and lioness making
love.
The role of the lazy lion in his
habitat is simply to reproduce and ,
even this takes some encoura-
gement from the lioness. The feat
takes three days consisting of a
series of thirty second busts at
twenty minute intervals. It seemed
the lioness didn't like too much fun
and the frustration on the lion was
quickly began to show Along with
our amorous lions we saw several
|jj|erds of elephants, rhinos, gir.r is
and hippos A quick tour down an
S e r e I wanted to spend my next
Holiday I would hove to • y South
Africa If it the mast wonderful
place on this planet. If you're
looking for a holiday of a life time
iirom sand to safari, white-water
Hiver» to cheap food then South
Africa is waiting with open arms.
