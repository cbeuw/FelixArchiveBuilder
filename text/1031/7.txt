Thailand
Bangkok caters for all types of
holiday makers, from the avid
sightseer to the serious clubber
who just wants to have some fun.
The Night Market on Silom Road
sells everything you could need.
Remember though - you get what
you pay for. Then there is the well
known Pat Pong: the go-go bars
and clubs welcome all tourist and
ex-pats for friendly entertainment.
For the serious clubber, you
can find the young, beautiful and
fashionable at So/ 4, Silom Road,
just along from Pat Pong. This is
the place to hang out, is seriously
trendy and you'll find the strangest
mix of people. Deeper is another
China
Travelling by train through the
Southern part of China you look
out of the window, past the tracks
strewn with rubbish cast out by the
passengers and see the rural
China you were expecting; there
really are coolie hatted workers
tending lush green paddy fields,
remote villages linked by mud
tracks, oxen being used to work
the land. But then the
train turns a corner and
a stark, ugly industrial
plant appears on the
horizon, looking incon*

apparent idyll China is
full of industry, you get
the sense it is a real
country, independent,
not needing to trade with the rest
of the world. Barges ply the rivers
loaded to within an inch of
flooding, your 'express' train will
stop to enable mile-long goods
trains to pass.
Wandering around the back
streets of cities you see small
popular small club, the music is
hardcore house and trance and
the most popular venues occur on
the weekends with international
DJs.
Shopping is another great
thing to do. Thailand is very cheap
so it is possible to over shop and
have too much to bring back
home. The best time is at the
weekends at Chatuchak Market. It
is great for the usual tourist goods
found in the Far East, handicrafts,
antiques, and clothes; Next on the
list will probably be MBK (Ma Boon
Krong), a Thai style cheezy
shopping mall. Locals shop here
for fashion imports and so it caters
for rockers, rappers and the usual
clubbers.
For sightseers the main
attraction in Bangkok is the Grand
Palace; stunning architecture
everywhere you look, and every
item seems to be laid with gold
leaf. There is a strict dress code in
the palace so no shorts or
miniskirts, otherwise you may end
up in a long queue for a pair of ill
fitting jumpsuit trousers. Another
popular tourist attraction is a river
trip on the river Ton, however
going during midday is not the
cottages piled high with cardboard
boxes containing plastic toys, the
boxes stamped 'Made in China'
and realise that this is where they
come from. Industry extends down
to the person in the street; the
notion that everything is made in
large factories entitled 'The
Number Thirteen People's Plastic
Football Factory' or similar is a
fallacy. Women cycle past with
baskets overflowing with high-tech
electrical components; the shop-
ping streets in towns have shops

Tourism is a fairly new

Travelling around Bangkok:
Bangkok has a continuous rush
hour throughout the day so be
prepared for a long slow journey.
There are taxis which have air
conditioning, tut tuts which allow
the passengers to experience the
full force of Bangkok's pollution
and bod drivers and then there are
the buses which should be
To fully relax, a short period at
one of Thailand's other resorts is a
very good idea. Koh Somui has
great beaches with loads of night
life with that island feel and is just
civilised enough for convenience.
Phuket island features hotels
galore for the wealthier tourist and
a bizarre vegetarian festival in
November which involves hypnotic
body piercing of the extremely
faithful. Also consider Pattaya:
many international travel agents
promote sex tours to this small
beach town which is 2hours from
Bangkok. Krabi has cheap
bungalows or the exclusive 5 star
Dusit Hotel. And lastly, Koh
Wwmngnangan is the place to find
the hippy in you.

unless you're willing to depart with
a large amount of cash in

tourist services It is a matter of
policy for non-Clfinese to be
charged more for train tickets,
pitry charges am the like. In the
sriuller cities the foreigner is still a
llDveiiy, ana as such is considered
fair game for surrounding and
staring at; also the treatment you
receive from officialdom often
seems hostile. A thick skin is useful
to avoid these irritations ruining
ifiltyr trip, but the sheer fascination
||f observing the last great
bureaucratic communist country is
something not to be missed before
Coca-Cola consumerism takes
over...

Venice
Venice is one of those cities that
everyone has heard of. It has been
the setting for many films, perhaps
most notably for the gondola
chase scene in Moonraker, in
which James Bond (aka Roger
Moore) powers a high-speed
gondola through the back-waters
of Venice, only to change into an
inflatable-car thingie and drive
away to safety. However, you
won't see this happening these
days, as the wakes from such fast
boats have begun to erode the

most unlikely city ever constructed
and is incredible to walk through
as almost every building is a work
of art. You can nevi quite get
used the sheer improbability of it
all, with boats serenely gliding
from street to street. The only

the number of tourists, but this

Prices ore high for
refreshments, and temperatures
are often hot, SO I personally
recommend a large packed lunch
and lots of bottled water to keep
yourself going. Taking a quick dip
to refresh yourself will not be
looked upon kindly by the locals.
You can either wander
aimlessly through Venice, or take
one of a number of guided tours
to help you make the best of your
stay. Most visitors do not actually
stay in Venice, but at a nearby
camp or hotel as I did, and catch a
bus and ferry to the city. The ferry
itself is something of an antique,
but does provide excellent views
(and photo-opportunities) when
leaving the city near sunset. In
short, Venice is a feast for the
eyes.
