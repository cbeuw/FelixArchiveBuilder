Cat's Tale
AValentine's Day Tale by Samin Ishtiaq
It was a couple of days before
Valentine's, and Nils, Paul and I were
sitting in some god-forsaken pub in
South Wimbledon. I blame Nils
entirely for ending up here. Fulham is
fine by me. Its pubs may be yuppyish
(can I say that word in the caring,
sharing 90s?) but it does have places
like the Slug, where women in tight
white jeans make eyes at you.
Anyway, we were in this pub and
talking lads' talk. This usually involves
football, beer, and rememberences of
drunken exploits in faraway places. At
this time of the year it also involves
women. But it's depressing to talk
about Nils' women: his prospects are

locks, gloves to disguise his fingerprints,
dark clothes to blend in with the bleak
academic surroundings, and an accurate

always dark. (To be a Norwegian
sounds unfortunate; to be an Imperial
graduate on top of that begins to
sound like carelessness.) "So, are you
going to hire a black limo for Zoe,
Samin?" Paul asked, referring to a
mutual friend who often had more
money than sense (and he didn't
have that much money either). Some
sniggers and then I countered with
"But do you think Ann will get a card
from Akshat this year?". The incident
this referred to caused so much mirth
amongst us that we nearly spilt our
pints. In lads' land this counts as
sacrilege, so I was promptly dis-
patched to refill the pork scratchings
supply.
The Akshat incident happened last
year, just around this time. Akshat
was a colleague of ours and shared a
Management course run by Ann
(surnames, I think, will have to be
excluded from this recollection).
Akshat wasn't a friend. In fact, I don't
think he could ever be anyone's
friend. He was like one of those pet
dogs you have when you're a kid: the
more you kick it the more it comes
back. In disgust at its lack of self-
esteem you would try to ignore it, but
the bully in you wouldn't let you do
that.
Besides these characteristics,
Akshat was also a test-bed for Nils'
Theory of Bullying. This ran as
follows: if someone is weak then you
should bully him, as this prepares him
for the real world. In the spirit of true
Inductivism, Nils had tried to establish
his theory by bullying his younger
brother - until he became bigger
than Nils. As Akshat had reached the
stage where he wouldn't grow any
more, we all thought
that we were safe
from this 'Mr Atlas'
effect that would
arise in experiments.
As soon as
Ann's management
course started we
started to tease
Akshat about Ann,
saying that he had a
thing about her. Of
course, he didn't. In
fact, it really was
only possible to
fancy Ann after half a dozen pints of
Santa Claus. Late in January Paul
came up with a new tease. He said to
Akshat that he would send a
Valentine's card to Ann signed with
Akshat's name. It was no surprise that
Akshat took this threat very seriously,
as Paul had upset a mutual friend by
actually performing this action a
couple of years back.
I suppose we could claim a first
in Nils' Theory. Akshat was pushed,
and proceeded to take a course of
action that was devious and
underhand. We had created a
monster: Akshat was like the
chartered accountant in Sha//ow
Grave. Akshat's plan was to break
into Ann's office on the eve of
Valentine's Day and steal the card.
He armed himself with gadgets to
pick locks, gloves to disguise his
fingerprints, dark clothes to blend in
with the bleak academic surr-
oundings, and an accurate under-
water stop watch to time himself.
Paul didn't actually do anything
about the card. (This wasn't the first
time: his plans for dieting and
exercise lie equally incomplete). But
Akshat, reading more into our
gestures than was there, undertook
his plan. O n February the 13th,
1994, at precisely 23.15, with a
prayer to all the gods that he could
think of, Akshat broke into Ann's
office. And at precisely 23.17, the
new, lean n' mean, privatised security
service caught their first intruder of
the year. (They had to be sharp, you
see, as performance indicators for
this year determined their budget
next year. Who says Thatcherism
doesn't work?)
Events took a swift and rather
cruel turn after that. I don't know the
details, but Akshat apparently dug his
own grave. He piled in a couple of
lies that contradicted each other
when led to their logical conclusion.
For the sake of decency we three
tried to intervene, but it was really all
over by then. In a way Akshat got
away lightly. He was allowed to stay
on 'till the end of the year and take
his exams. But his chances of getting
a good reference were lost.
Akshat had originally wanted to
go to some college in Massachusetts
- I forget the name. After the incident
he kept up the pretence that he was
doing GREs and whatever else it is
that Americans do to get into
'graduate school'. He said to
everyone that there was no problem
getting into this college; that all they
wanted was a 2:2. Most of our class
just went "yeah, yeah" and passed
by. The end of the year came and
Akshat disappeared. We never did
expect to get any e-mail from
'akshat@mass.edu', so were not
surprised when nothing appeared.
Ann still teaches the manag-
ement course. Apparently, she wasn't
even aware of the whole story, just
that somebody had tried to break into
her office.
There's a moral to this whole tale, but
I don't know what it is. I originally
thought the story was the funny side
to Valentine's Day. But maybe it isn't
that funny. ("Comedy + Time =
Tragedy" wrote Woody Allen, for
Manhattan I think.) Useful idiots
abound (Akshat, Richard Gott) and
it's fun to play tricks on them. But
when it comes to the end...
