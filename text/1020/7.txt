Astronomers say there are now thirteen star signs. Unlucky for some?

This is an ancient verse listing the
twelve signs of the zodiac. The zodiac,
a word derived from the Greek zodi-
akos, meaning '(a circle) of animals', is
used to predict your future, depending
upon w h i c h sign you were 'born
under'.
Love them or loathe them, these
predictions, or horoscopes, are a large
part of today's culture... and are about
to undergo a radical change. Recent
discoveries suggest that the star sign
you once thought you were is no
longer valid. A complete shift in the
zodiac could mean that your true per-
sonality now follows the traits of the
preceding star sign. For instance, i f
your birthday is on 30th M a r c h ,
instead of being a fiery, passionate
Aries, you are actually a dreamy
Pisces.
For many people this could be
alarming. Y o u may have been foll-
owing the wrong advice - a bit of a
problem i f you have been quitting
jobs, dumping partners and so on,
happy in the knowledge that this tem-
porary misery will eventually lead to a
fulfilling and exciting future - it
won't. So now you're t h i n k i n g of
throwing in the towel... better consult
your horoscope... but which one?
Of course this could be enlight-
ening. If your star sign predicts you to
be introverted, hard-working and bor-
ing but you find it hard to fit into this
model, it could well be that your new
star sign says you are the vivacious,
drop-dead gorgeous lurve-god you
always knew you were!
So why the change? W e l l ,
astronomers claim there is a thir-
teenth sign, previously omitted from
the original zodiac. The zodiac was
drawn up by the Egyptians, who used
it as a time-measuring device rather
than a means by which to spot part-
ners and pitfalls. It works by following
the path of the sun through, initially,
twelve constellations of stars. The
days of the year were divided up
I f
m
equally into twelve, on the assumption
that the sun stays in each constellation
for the same length of time. No-one
ever questioned this because the stars
come out at night, when we cannot see
the sun.
A c c o r d i n g to the Royal
Astronomical Society, the sun passes
through a previously undetected thir-
teenth constellation, which leads us to
this thirteenth sign of the zodiac -
Ophiuchus - named after Aschlepius,
the Greek God of healing. This sign is
inserted between Scorpio and
Sagittarius in the original zodiac, so if
you were born between November
30th and December 17th, you now
have a star sign of your own -
Ophiuchus. This results in a general
shift and shortening of the other star
signs. However, this isn't the only way
in which the new zodiac will differ
from the traditional one. T h e
International Astronomical U n i o n
suggests that the year should not be
divided up equally. Instead, the signs
should be assigned different numbers
of days according to the different sizes
of the constellations.
The result of all this change is
that the zodiac is now completely dif-
ferent, and very few people will keep
their original star sign. But how do
we, the horoscope-reading public,
respond to such changes? The general
consensus of people I've spoken to is,
why change it? Many people feel that
the personality predicted by their star
sign is an accurate description of their
true personality. Or is it that we
change to live up to our star sign? And
what about all the mugs, tea towels, T-
shirts, books and personalised
horoscopes that we've invested
good money in?
In my opinion, changing
the zodiac is useless. Although I
enjoy reading about my fate as
an Aquarius (especially when I
found a book that spent an
entire page telling me how gor-
geously attractive I was!), I don't
place too much emphasis on
what it tells me.
We all know, deep down,
that it's just a bit of fun. If horo-
scopes were true, it would imply
that one-twelfth of the popula-
tion will all have similar events
happen to them each day. You have to
agree that's a ridiculous notion. A n d
horoscopes are so often wrong. I've
lost count of the number of times I've
spent days w a i t i n g for 'the big
romance of the year' or 'a large wind-
fall of money'. In fact the horoscopes
are wrong as many times as they are
right - and this would still be true for
my new sign.
My mother has an amazing tal-
ent for reading things into horoscopes
that no-one else can. For example, if
she read that 'Today you will suffer
the consequences of something you
did yesterday that you suspected to be
wrong', my mum would probably say
"Oh dear, I suspected that m i l k I
drank yesterday could have been off...
I'll be i l l today then... better take the
day off work." M i l k ? I would have
expected it to mean illicit affairs or
m i l d c r i m i n a l action, not mouldy
milk!
But back to the issue. I really
feel astronomers should leave the
zodiac alone. O f course, this has
absolutely nothing to do with me
reading up about Capricorn (the star
sign that the new zodiac would make
me) and deciding that I prefer the
sound of Aquarius! Horoscopes are
just a bit of fun, and astronomers
should lighten up, get a life and keep
their noses out of astrology.
Incidentally, my horoscope for
this year says my love life will take a
turn for the better, my career
prospects will drastically improve, and
I will pass my end of year exams - I
have to believe this... horoscopes don't
fail me now! Q
