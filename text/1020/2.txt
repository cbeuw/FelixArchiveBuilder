Kings Caught
BY A N D R E W S M I T H
Kings College students were
involved in a reckless attack on
Imperial College Union's (ICU)
Traditional Bar last Saturday.
Speculation continues that the
raid was officially planned by
members of the Kings College
Students' Union.
In what has been described
as a 'misguided mascotry
retaliation', fourteen K i n g s
students arrived in a minibus and
entered the Traditional Bar via
Da Vinci's, removing bottles of
alcohol and a number of
tankards. On finding the exit of
the Traditional Bar locked, the
attackers then broke the old oak
doors in an attempt to make their
escape.
The cost of the raid, which
may eventually total as much as
£2000, was incurred largely as a
result of damage inflicted on the
ancient doors. Several historical
college tankards also need repair
or replacement. Off-duty bar
stewards and former IC students
managed to apprehend four of
the King's students; l i m i t i n g
further destruction and
providing initial information
about the incident.
Whilst a number of the
students involved i n the attack
were in their first year at Kings,
it has been confirmed that the
chairman of K i n g s ' Student
Representative Council (SRC)
was one of the raiders. However,
the K i n g s Students' U n i o n
President, Ghassan Karian, is
now keen to describe mascotry as
'toss' despite displaying an
interest in the activity earlier this
year.
Ghassan, who following the
withdrawal of Lucy Chothia is
the leading candidate for
University of London President,
blamed IC for the attack.
Speaking to F E L I X he claimed
that it was 'Imperial's fault', but
later suggested that it was
indirectly the fault of the Royal
College of Science U n i o n
(RCSU). According to M r Karian
the event has its origin i n the
RCSU's taking of Kings' mascot,
a stone lion called Reggie, last
year.
He insisted that his Union
was not involved, nor had they
prior knowledge of the event. He
also denied allegations that a
K i n g s ' minibus was used.
Following the incident, which
may damage his image i n the
Presidential race, the K i n g s '
Sabbatical is now distancing
himself from mascotry in general.
The I C U Executive Com-
mittee, meeting this Monday,
w i l l decide whether to press
charges immediately, or whether
to delay a final decision. Lucy
Chothia, I C U President, has
made clear her preference that
the people who organised the
attack should take responsibility
rather than, 'a few naive 1st
years'. The possibility of pressing
charges is available because a
security camera, erected after
previous violent incidents, the
minibus used in the raid and the
offending students as they
entered Beit Quad.
NUS Court Imperial Students
BY M I C H A E L L U D L A M
Imperial College U n i o n (ICU)
may have moved a step closer to
affiliation of the National Union
of Students ( N U S ) this week.
Representatives of the NUS spent
the week talking to members of
I C U Council i n an attempt to
persuade it of the benefits of
joining the national union.
So far the N U S has offered
an annual affiliation fee of
£20,000, reduced from £40,000, to
try to attract ICU. They have also
guaranteed a saving of at least
£11,000 on beer from the bulk
buying group that the N U S
operates, whilst further savings
on shop items and spirits have
yet to be worked out. However, it
is unclear how this will benefit
those students using the Union
bars as the price of beer served
would not change. The £9000
shortfall from the affiliation fee
would also have to be found from
somewhere. U n i o n sources
suggest that clubs and societies'
funding would be hit.
In justifying the extra £9000,
the NUS have been keen to stress
that it offers more than savings
on alcohol. Speaking to F E L I X ,
Steve Hay, N U S Treasurer said:
"We offer a wide range of
services, not just N U S services
L t d . [The company N U S
operates with bulk buying
powers]". They were also keen to
stress their political credentials
and achievements in influencing
government policy, though the
NUS would continue to fight for
student rights whether or not
Imperial was a member. Other
advantages of membership, say
the N U S , would be free legal
advice, available to the Union as
well as individual NUS members.
Although they would not pay for
all court cases, "we support test
cases that will improve the well
being of students," said Sharon
Hunter, Regional Worker for
London.
If Imperial were to join the
N U S it would have about six
elected delegates to send to the
National Conference, the N U S '
decision making body. At present
there are a total of 900 delegates.
Critics of any affiliation
plans see this as proof that
Imperial would not have a
particularly loud voice within the
national body. There is also a
certain amount of suspicion
amongst students concerning the
N U S ' eagerness for Imperial to
join. It has been suggested that it
would be 'a feather in their cap'
were ICU to say yes.
At present the process is still
at a consultation stage but it is
now clear that a referendum of IC
students is very likely in the near
future.
