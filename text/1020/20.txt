Standby
beating around the bulge
Few who read the music press even
occasionally could have failed to
notice the attention given to belly
and particularly to Tanya Donelly
about a year ago. Since then Oasis
have become the new darlings of
the Indie Scene, but Belly are back
with their new album king.
There are fewer instantly
graspable 'poppy' tunes then I
expected, but this is basically a
good thing from the point of view
of continued listening. The
trademark drum emphasising indie
rhythm has been toned down too.
However, the main thing you notice
is the change in Ms Donelly's vocal
style. The bite is still there, but she
stays much closer to the melody,
and more often or not in key! The
band also plays more tightly than
before, though this is only to be
expected as familiarity grows.
These changes make this album
quite a progression, and while
some will dislike them, it makes it
easier to concentrate on and
appreciate the very real talent this
band have.
My only real criticism is that
occasionally you feel that too much
attention has been paid to detail
and that some of the edge has
gone. However listening through to
the brilliant final track 'Judas My
Heart', this little niggle is easily
forgotten as you realise just how
good Belly are at writing quality
songs, which owe more to folk than
indie. (9)
The senseless things' fourth
long-player, taking care of business,
shows the Things honing their
sound to paradoxically incorporate
more of their favourite bands whilst
sounding even more like
themselves. The likes of 'Christine
Keeler' and 'Role Models' are the
perfect examples, melodic pastiches
which plunder from the treasure-
chests of the New York Dolls, Soul
Asylum and, of course, the
Replacements, but which rock in a
big, bold, and completely non-
brassy kind of way.
Elsewhere, 'Dead Sun' shows
that they still know how to play
punk, but then that was always a
natural and organic part of their
sound, not some new-style fad that
they picked up on just after the
gutter music press did. Meanwhile,
'16-18-21' and 'Page 3 Valentine'
open up even more avenues,
marrying rhythmic movements to
scything guitar riffs with Mark Keds'
familiar rasp articulating his
polemic thoughts on religion, love,
icons, and all things relevant over
the top. No apologies are made for
using that well-worn cliche: every
F E L I X
track's a winner.
With a songwriting prowess
like Mark's it's small wonder that
he's currently being courted by
lesser bands who have taken from
the Senseless Things in over-liberal
quantities and had greater success.
Ignore the NME, ignore your
prejudices, and hey, ignore my
superlatives, but make sure you buy
this album. (9)
Over the last year victoria
Williams has got more attention
from the fact that she's 'got' MS
than the fact that she's a musician.
But her Dingwall's gig last week
showed where sweet relief ended
and the real woman begins.
Whereas on record she can
sometimes come across as some
lost remnant from a California hippy
convent, live it quickly becomes
clear that she's simply enjoying
herself. Towards the end, the
evening developed into a request
show. Some artists might have
thought this demanding but Victoria
just smiled and said, "oh yeah
that's a good one" and did it.
Unsurprisingly she had to come
back for two encores.
Still before that point domestic
bliss was ensured as Victoria's
husband, Mark Olsen from the
Jayhawks, turned up - apparently it
was the first time they'd seen each
other in months due to their touring
schedules. Which is nice way to
sum the lady up. She wasn't sure
he was there so had to ask, "Mark
are you here?". "Yes", he said and
they sang a couple of songs
together. Anyone else and it would
have sickening (and totally false).
In light of all the shenanigans
your intrepid music reviewer had to
endure to get into d r e a m
theater's gig in Ronnie Scott's, it
was a good job it was worth the
effort. A one-off affair in relaxed
and intimate surroundings, this was
apparently designed to allow the
band to play a number of their
favourite cover versions with an
even greater number of special
guests. And so we were treated to a
whole spectrum of influences -
from U2's 'Red Hill Mining Town' to
Marillion's 'Easter' (with Steve
Hogarth and Steve Rothery) right
through to Metallica's 'Damage
Inc.' (with Napalm Death's Barney
on guest vocals). In between there
were healthy Rush and Yes
workouts and an amazing musical
jam featuring Yes' Steve Howe. All
in all the band did absolutely no
harm to their burgeoning
reputation as the most accomp-
lished group of musicians in the
world. 0
