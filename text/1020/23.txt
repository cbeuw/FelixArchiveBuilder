ICvs West Sussex
A six man squad left Imperial an
Tuesday to play West Sussex
University in the second round
playoffs of the BUSA tournament.
It was evident from our
performance in the first set that
we had been subjected to non-stop
talk Radio Shervin Badamchi for
the 2 hour journey.
West Sussex had to do little to
take the set from us. Slowly
getting accustomed to the low
ceiling, a hostile crowd of 20 girls
and the sight of the coach of the
next round's opposition sitting in
the audience furiously taking
notes, we played as if in a daze.
The next set was also finished
in record time, despite judicious
use of Time Outs by captain
Robert Stravens. Again we didn't
put up a fight, slipping under easy
attacks. We entered the third set
2-0 down, knowing that we were
capable of beating this opposition.
But we had lost the confidence
needed to finish our carefully
choreographed at tacks. Still in
shock from the first 2 sets, we lost
the third and the game with it.
Some good play by E d Duffus
only delayed the end. "Our 4 best
players couldn't come," we
explained to them. Thick random
poly we said to each other on the
way back when Shervin paused
for breath. The other players were
Sebastien fauzan, Piotr Stanczyk
and Manfred Kracs.

Last Sunday's event was at
Burnham Beeches, near Slough.
We had very late start, so
everyone got a lie-in, to such an
extent that some people missed
the bus.
William and Matt staggered
around the 13km, M21 long
course in respectable times of
lOOmins, only to find it had been
won in 65mins. Carol staggered
around the 9.3 km, W2IL course
and got a gold standard. Hans
stormed round the M21 short
course but failed to get a gold
standard, while Shao Wei also
had a successful run. Henza and
Jenny had fun on the Orange.
The day's highlights: muddy
puddles. The day's lowlights: we
didn't finish in time for the pub.

IC men II vs Reading0
The first pair H.S. Ooi and D .
Hart played well winning all
three games, despite a slow start.
J. Kwok and H . Huay, the second
pair, did their part, winning only
one game because R. Huray
retired hurt in the last game. The
experienced third pair, C. L i m
(captain) and A. Saw played in
their usual manner, only losing
against the opposing first pair.
IC Ladies LsfvsU.E.A.0
An excellent result for the ladies
team, taking us to the third round
of the BUSA tournament. Well
done to Wendy, Danielle, Kate,
Claire, Elaine and Barbara.

IC Ladies v s K C H 0
Having waited an extra half an
hour at Victoria, we discovered
we were one player short.
Lndaunted, we made our way
through the wilderness of south-
west London to the K C H ground.
With a little extra effort from
everyone, we were all over the
opposition. Despite the chances
available, nobody could finish
anything off in the first half.
Star guests Paula (centre
back) and Juliette (right forward),
who scored the second scorcher,
did well-as well as Linda, the
QPR keeper we borrowed!
Woman of the match, Paula
Bates, opened our scoring in the
second half with a great shot,
ripping apart KCH's defence.
Our usual keeper, Thurka,
didn't let anyone past her on the
right, matching Emily's (left
back) performance. Eleanor in a
new position, right mid-field, and
Helen in left-mid performed
superbly. Ioanna was a great help
for Maryam, covering the centre
of the pitch.
Paula B. said "the best chance
they [KCH] had was the clearance
Maryam made". The afore
mentioned also scared the keeper,
who did not know what her team-
mate was up to when she
conceded that corner.
Thanks to all those who
turned up. Well done! We
deserved to win.

IC 2nd vs RHLMC 1110
On Saturday 4th February, the
Pie-eaters extended their winning
run in the league to 6 games.
Royal Holloway were absolutely
gulled when we beat them 5-4,
with "Nixo" scoring the winning
goal with 5 minutes to go. Dodgy
middle eastern geeler B. Kebab
also claimed a hat-trick.
ICIIvsQMWCII0
Wednesday the 8th saw a 9 goal
thriller. "Silver Fox" John Day
got a hat-trick and P. "slag"
Siverns put someone in Hospital
after breaking his ribs. As usual
Scott Osbourne and T. Hallet
took the piss at the back and C.
Lord looked as sexy as a
mountain goat. "Banana"
Fouskos was his usual self,
although more polite than usual
to the opposition. Tai stood in
and looked more than
comfortable as a debut slag.
Two glorious performances
promise much-IC II arc second in
the league and in the semi-finals
of the London Cup.
C'mon lads lets not loose that
loving feeling!!

IC I vs L S E 0
The IC squash steamroller
continues! On Wednesday, the IC
Ist team beat LSE 3-2 to move
into the third round of the BUSA
knock-out tournament. Despite
various coughs and colds, not to
mention some very "creative"
refereeing, Sonaar Shah, Craig
Robinson and Aman Zafar won
their matches, making up for
Adam Waddington's and Adam
Bettinson's losses. Craig deserves
a special mention as he was lucky
enough (?) to be called into the
team at the last minute and won
the crucial 3rd game.
We won 3-1 against St Marys and
the individuals results were as
follows: Nick losl 2-3, Dave won
3-0, Garry (captain) won 3-0 and
Alex won 3-0.
Highlights of the match were;
the girl (Charlie) who played for
St Marys at number 4 against
Alex, the fish'n'chips in the
union afterwards and the pub in
Paddington that stayed open until
1 o'clock, serving drinks.

Despite the atrocious weather
conditions and the absence of
West London Institute to mark
the course out, Imperial took up
the challenge running with
zealous velocity, but not quite as
fast as their post-race departure to
the nearest pub.
A late burst from Ollie was
not quite enough to catch the
super fit flyaway Andy.
Exceptional performances were
shown by James and Gerald, but
were was our fifth runner? Out-
standing placings from Emily and
Kay should ensure thai the
women will be league champions
again.
Men:
Andy Ovcrcnd (14th)
Ollie Brown (15th)
James Tindal-Robertson (22nd)
Gerald Johnson (34th)
Women:
