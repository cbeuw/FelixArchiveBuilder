News In Brief

New Chairman for IC
The Governing Body of Imperial
College is now officially looking
for a new Chairman to succeed
the Rt. Hon. Sir Frank Cooper,
the present incumbent. A Search
Committee, taking its member-
ship from the Governing Body,
has been created to form a short-
list of possible candidates for the
unpaid post.
The Rector and two
academic staff members,
Professors Julia H i g g i n s and
Lester Kerschenbaum, are
among the seven member panel
given the difficult task. Sir Frank
has agreed to stay on as
Chairman, presuming the Privy
C o u n c i l give their necessary
assent, until a successor is found.
He has however made it quite
clear that he wishes to retire in
the near future having celebrated
his 72nd birthday two months
ago.
While a candidate has not
been found for this highly taxing
post up until now, it is hoped
that a recommendation will be
made to the Governing Body by
the end of this academic year.
IC Reporter to Report
With an initial print run of 5,000
copies, the latest attempt to
produce a regular Imperial
College staff newspaper hits the
stands this Tuesday. T C
Reporter' as it will be known,
w i l l replace the now defunct
newspaper 'Network', whose
increasingly sporadic output
finally ceased last March.
W i t h the Press and Public
Relations Officer, V i c k y
Browning at the helm as editor,
and correspondents i n every
department, its four broadsheet
pages is sure to be eagerly
awaited by all Imperial College
staff, who will each be given their
very own copy.
The Rector of Imperial
College, Professor Sir Ronald
Oxburgh, is known to have been
concerned at the lack of a staff
newspaper for some time and so
the year long wait for this new
publication is therefore some-
what surprising. The Rector
wished the college funded paper
the 'best of luck' and emphasised
that college required such a
bulletin to inform staff of college
developments.
F E L I X readers w i l l be
happy to know that Sir Ronald
does not think that TC Reporter'
will threaten F E L l X ' s position
but rather will 'complement' it
with factual articles.
Half-Hearted Day
Ian Caldwell, Director of Estates,
came i n for close questioning
during last week's Academic
Affairs half day.
During a lengthy afternoon
session, much discussion centred
on the price of bread. Apparently
Southside Shop prices are
presently of great concern to
students.
M r Caldwell was also
pressured over the shortage of
college accommodation, parti-
cularly considering the influx of
students the medical school
merger will bring. He was asked
to justify the length of time taken
to replace the fire alarms i n
Linstead Hall which are still not
fully operational - over a year
after the installation was started.
The need for the system was
demonstrated last Friday when a
small fire started after a student
left a candle b u r n i n g i n her
room.
Matthew Szyndel, Academic
Affairs Officer for the RCSU and
chief coordinator of the
proceedings said he was
'relatively happy' with the
proceedings. He said that the
opportunity students had to
question key college staff made
the event worthwhile. "It's the
people you've got there listening
to the response that makes the
difference."
M i s s L u c y Chothia, I C U
President, also agreed saying:
"Communication between staff
and the student body is really
poor at the moment."
A Poor Start?
It's typical. The Valentine's issue
comes along and my c o l u m n
shrinks to nothing...
Between the covers
We've tried to go for a romantic
feel this week but hopefully we
haven't totally swamped you with
unwelcome attention - the Cat &
Mouse may sharpen your taste a
little for our regular opinion spot
and those wishing to consult
their horoscopes to find love (or
avoid sappy media promotions)
can check out Samantha's article
on page seven.
On the love front, Kamran
provides a solid slant on a subject
given a lot of lip service. The
centre pages hold his feature on
mixed relationships i n their
grasp. Meanwhile, those masters
of lips and fast talk, S-files,
assume their role as pop-tarts to
ask a few vaguely relevant
questions and our new ace,
Jeremy Thomson, gets off the
blocks with a look at the
Valentine myth. Cat's Tale
provides fiction for those who
need it.
Basically I've been far too
verbose recently so I'm going to
sign off here and go home.
Happy Loving Imperial College.
Oh, and get well soon Mark.
