Merger Thwarted
BY A N D Y S I N H A R A Y
The creation of one of the largest
medical schools in the country
was thwarted last week as a bill to
merge St Bartholemew's and the
Royal London Hospital Medical
Schools with Queen Mary and
Westfield College ( Q M W ) was
defeated i n the House of
Commons.
The b i l l , blocked at the
eleventh hour by Labour M P s
lead by Bryan Sedgemoor, the
Member of Parliament for
Hackney and Shoreditch, could
affect the already difficult merger
of Barts with the Royal London
and means that it is now unlikely
to take place this year.
M r Sedgemoor M P was
concerned at the possible
relocation of the medical schools
in any merger. However,
speaking to F E L I X , D a v i d
Jaynes, Academic Secretary at
Q M W said that re-siting of the
colleges had not yet been
considered. H e added that
current proposals would in fact
have developed the Royal
London's Whitechapel site.
M r Jaynes d i d not seem
surprised at the bill's failure.
"We knew it would happen ...
there have been doubts over the
future of Barts and this arouses
strong passions with an
institution with such history," he
remarked.
D r Julian A x e , college
secretary at Barts, suggested that
the issue had more to do with the
future of the N H S in London
being decided 'by M P s who
believe that centralising is not
the right option'. He felt that
they were benefiting from
working within the Tomlinson
report of 1992, which_recom-
mended the merger of medical
schools and the closure of
hospitals in London. "There's a
good synergy between London
and Barts", he said. Merging
would save money and would
help to meet H M Treasury
guidelines which recommend
savings of 3% each year, over the
next 3 years. Certain resources
would have to be re-allocated to
different areas, and in many cases
staff positions would be created.
Representatives from the
colleges are confident that the
merger will go ahead anyway.
QMW's principal, Prof. Graham
Zellick, said: "We believe the bill
will be passed and receive Royal
Assent despite the blocking
motion... detailed work continues
and the three colleges remain
firmly committed to the merger."
Julian Axe agreed: "It's just
a question of when it's going to
happen, rather than if ... and it
could be something rather
exciting."
And they're off!

- A T . The first event on the
&Smb 1994/1995 sabbatical
M £ « election timetable has
^ • J ^ ^ < ? arrived. Papers went
up on Monday for the
four posts: President, Deputy
President (Finance & Services),
Deputy President (Clubs &
Societies) and F E L I X Editor &
Print Unit Manager.
As we went to press, five
candidates had declared them-
selves. The declared candidates
are: for President: Kevin Ward,
Physics; for Deputy President
( F & S ) : Matthew Crompton,
Geology and Annie Matthewman,
Computing; for Deputy President
(C&S): Maryam Yahyavi,
Physics; for F E L I X Editor and
Print U n i t Manager: Rachel
Walters, Chemistry.
W i t h one week remaining
until papers come down, election
speculation is still the focus of
attention. Last week's academic
affairs half day saw two Dep
Reps, Sarah White of Geology
and Miles Ambler of Chemistry,
make speeches that some have
seen as blatant electioneering.
F E L I X understands that M s
White is the reason behind the
mass resignation of R S M U
officials from the elections
committee and she is therefore
likely to have strong R S M U
support.
Rumours of Miles Ambler's .
candidacy have been surrounded
by controversy. M r Ambler only
this week resigned from the
elections committee, citing a
conflict of interest. W h e n
randomly selected to be part of
the committee and asked by Lucy
Chothia, I C U President, whether
he had a conflict of interest, M r
Ambler had originally denied
that he was considering running
for President.
Suggestions that Simon
Govier, senior I C U steward and
former F E L I X business
manager, intends to stand for
Deputy President ( F & S ) have
reached F E L I X . When asked,
Mr Govier gave a passionate but
contradictory response. Paul
Dias, the subject of much
speculation, is also still at large.
Though five candidates have
been declared, as we went to press
only two of them, Rachel Walters
and Maryam Yahyavi had been
fully seconded. Ms Walters took
less than a day to reach the
required twenty seconders.
Papers come down next
Friday, after which those
standing will have to persuade
the Imperial community that
they should be given a sabbatical
post when voting takes place on
6th and 7th of March.
Once again Imperial College Dance Team met with success at the annual 'Shefield Social', writes Michael Ludlam. They won many of the pri
the Knockout Trophy and the Team dances, continuing their domination of the event over the pastfew years.
