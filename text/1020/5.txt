Private Lee Clegg, member of
the Parachute Regiment, was
part of a patrol which shot and
killed the driver and backseat
passenger of a car which sped
past them as they patrolled a
West Belfast street. H e was
convicted of the murder of Karen
Reilly, a Belfast teenager, and was
sentenced to life imprisonment.
The public continues to be
assaulted by press articles
protesting at Private Clegg's
continued detention i n Wake-
field prison. The Mail i n par-
ticular has embarked upon a
fairly blatant smear campaign
against Karen Reilly's family.
The public's response has been
amazing; the newspaper has
already collected one m i l l i o n
signatures calling for Clegg's
immediate release.
What really happened on
that night will never be clear.
Arguments still rage as to
whether the group
of sixteen soldiers
and a token police
officer were ever
informed that they were to
operate against joyriders. The
trial was told that the soldiers
were explicitly sent out to 'catch'
joyriders. Clegg's supporters
insist that they were never told
this, and that the patrol were
even warned to be extra vigilant
against terrorists that night.
The Mail and Telegraph
have glossed over the fact that
the speeding car d i d not go
through an official checkpoint,
the one they had originally set up
having been disbanded earlier.
The group of squaddies and sole
R U C officer were walking along
the road, guns at the ready, i n
what is known as a moving
checkpoint. This is, i n effect,
simply a term that allows the
patrol to stop

There is no
doubt that the
patrol clearly realised that they
had committed an unlawful
killing, in that after the shooting
they conspired to pervert the
course of justice by claiming that
the car had in fact hit one of the
soldiers. The members of the
patrol testified that Private Chris
A i n d o w had been hit by the
Astra, and so attempted to prove
that they were i n danger, even
when the car was speeding away.
T h i s testimony was not
seriously questioned until the
R U C officer belatedly, but with
considerable courage, admitted
that the car had never struck
anyone. In an eleven-page
statement to the court that
convicted Private Clegg, the
officer acknowledged that the
patrol was never in any danger
and that Private A i n d o w had
allowed his leg to be beaten in an
attempt to justify the killings.
Whether they knew they
were operating against joyriders,
or whether they really tried to
stop the car legally does not
matter. This act of injuring one
member's leg proves that the
whole group knew that they
would never be able to defend
what they had done as being
operationally or legally accep-
table.

My image of the paras is a
product of those hard-
nosed BBC2 documentaries that
show a punishing regime of
frightening peer pressure, and
quite incredible brutality. I know
nothing about the logic behind
training, which includes sleep
deprivation, laden 20-km runs,
and the public humiliation and
punishment of those who can't
keep up. But the discipline and
single-mindedness they exem-
plify seems to be the stuff that
produced the fighting we were so
proud of i n the Falklands and
Gulf Wars.
Private Lee Clegg shot an
18-year-old British girl i n the
back, in a deprived area of one of
our largest cities. The incon-
gruity of men trained for modern
combat dealing with joyriding, a
problem so symptomatic of
inner-city hardship, is quite
overwhelming. In their barracks,
the patrol constructed a cele-
bratory model of the car they
shot 36 bullets at. A notice read:
"Vauxhall Astra. Built by robots.
Driven by joyriders. Stopped by
'A' company".
But not only
does this issue raise //
Clegg's dreadful, but nontheless
unpremeditated, crime is clas-
sified in the same terms as the
horrors perpetrated by Frederick
West. The Court of Appeal and
the House of Lords both said that
the system would be a much
fairer if the defendant could be
charged with the

killings in Ulster, ranging from
armed members of the I R A to
civilians and children. After the
one other successful conviction
for murder, Pte Ian Thaine was
quietly released after serving less
than three years. N o r m a l l y ,
prisoners given life imprison-
ment have their cases reviewed
after 10 years, and sentences
served have usually been in the
range of 12-17 years. There was
an outcry last month when the
Irish Republic released five IRA
prisoners, despite the fact that
the most serious offence was for
the possession of firearms, and
that all five had served most of
their sentences.
One of the biggest com-
plaints of the nationalists of
Ulster is the lack of accoun-
tability of the security services
who serve there. They use it as an
excuse to perpetuate the bigotry
and intolerance that inflict the
province. We cannot possibly get
any further with the peace
process so long as such blatant
inconsistencies i n our system of
justice remain.
