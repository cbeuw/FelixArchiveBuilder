Dear Editor,
The installation of condom
machines in Sherfield Building is a
welcome move. However, "safe sex
in the JCR" has been a possibility
for several years. Since 1991
condoms have been available free
from Imperial College Health
Centre. This service has been
advertised several times in f e l i x
and is described under the Health
Centre entry in the Fresher's
Handbook. The condoms can be
obtained either by asking at the
Health Centre Reception Desk or
consulting one of the doctors or
nurses. We also offer advice on all
matters of sexual health.
Yours sincerely,
Dr Irene Weinreb
Imperial College Health Centre
Any comment I made here would be
regarded as either (a) crude, (b)
unnecessary, or (c) both.
On the Eecord
Dear Owain,
The "record turnout" to see Tony
Benn (actually Labour's first event)
that you reported in your last issue
is entirely unsurprising. The
curiosity of those attending is
nothing more than a reflection of
the irrelevance of his eccentric
views to mainstream political
debate. The severity of his criticism
of the Labour Party must surely
indicate that the event wasn't as
great a success for the Labour
Society as some might think.
The Conservative Society have
in contrast invited six important
M.P.s before David Hunt, all of
whom have some real impact on
the political process. Mr. Hunt was
warmly greeted by those present
and the comments in the questions
round were all intelligent and
constructive. It is certainly true that
many of our members are
concerned about the future of our
democracy in a federal Europe, but
I make no apologies for that.
Labour in contrast are prisoners of
the trade unions (that's Clause II,
Mr. Blair) who see the expansion of
the European Commission as an
expedient albeit undemocratic way
of achieving the reversal of the
employment law reforms of the last
sixteen years.
The Chancellor has himself
acknowledged the unpopularity of
the recent but necessary tax
increases so it is misinformed to
report David Hunt's echo of that as
a "veiled attack" on his colleague.
Nor did he once mention that tax
cuts might be necessary to win the
next election. In summary, our
party is still very active here and
even if you don't agree with us on
many issues, I invite you to take
opportunities such as these events
to address your concerns directly to
people with real influence. Teresa
Gorman, Lord Archer and Stephen
Dorrell will be visiting over the next
few weeks (see our posters) and
Michael Portillo himself will be
coming next term.

/ don't know about the rest of you,
but I very quickly get bored with
uncalled-for one-upmanship. How
many ConSoc members went to
hear Tony Benn? Come to that, how
many LabSoc members went to
David Hunt's presentation? The only
way things will improve is by an
objective exchange of ideas....
A Delicate
Constitution
Dear Sir,
Last week's (Issue 7018 - Ed) article
on the British 'Constitutional Crisis'
deserves some kind of response in
order to ensure that such
blinkered, fatigued conservatism
(small 'c') does not go
unchallenged.
So the British citizen has lived a
life as free as any other during
modern times. In a society whose
lack of accountable political
institutions allows the political
trend of the day to steamroller
society into meekly accepting the
implementation of whatever
ideology serves their particular
interest group best (the erosion of
the fundaments of our social
structure and the rights of the
individual, and the descent of the
economy into an investment-
starved grapple for short-term
profit during the last decade is,
depressingly, proof enough). In a
society where any call for true
democratic representation is
sounded out by traditionalistic
sentiments for an over-centralised,
anachronistic system based largely
on the accumulated prejudices and
predilections of past centuries. In a
symbolic head represents the last
vulgar remnants of our feudal
history, which we have not the
courage to question for fear of
denting our fragile sense of
national identity, preferring to live
in a Monarchist Britain Theme Park
rather than facing up to the reality
of the needs of our society and its
place in the world today.

to watch, but it is no place to live."

Umm... yes. Hang on while I get
my dictionary, and try to untangle
your sentences. Your points are
well-made, if a trifle long-winded,
and in principle I agree with you.
I'm not sure about the
decentralisation thing, but I expect
someone will write in to explain it
all to me.
London Lives
Dear Owain,
I never thought I'd be writing to
you in support of anyone's opinion,
but after reading Kaizen's
Cat&Mouse article about Imperial
College Students' social lives, I
decided that I should. Before
coming to college, I had a huge
decision to make - UCL or
Imperial? A lot of people told me
about the apathetic life especially
at IC halls, so I figured that if I
stayed in an intercollegiate hall, I
can experience London and still get
an excellent education. 'Till now it
has been working fine. However, I
felt very bad when people on my
corridor did not believe I went to IC
for the first two weeks of me being
here. I get looked at weirdly when I
say that I go to IC in a trance or
rock/indie club. Some people on
my course haven't even heard of
some of the most popular clubs in
London, get totally stunned when I
say I've been on a pubcrawl on a
weekday (in my first term!). Maybe
it's the type of people they are,
since hard work and an awkward
male:female ratio do not
necessarily cause people to
become like that. I may also have
to be more considerate, but to
many of them, my attitude is still
GET WITH THE PROGRAM
A normal (I hope!)
City & Guilds Ist Year
/ know exactly what you mean.
When I venture beyond Hyde Park,
(which, admittedly, happens only
rarely) to see friends at other
Colleges, I find myself apologising
as I tell their friends where I study.
As for the lack bemoaned by
Kaizen, of cultivation of interest in
art and literature at IC, I have
recently started reading
Shakespeare (only 99p a classic at a
certain Cromwell Rd superstore!).
It's not much, but it's a start....
