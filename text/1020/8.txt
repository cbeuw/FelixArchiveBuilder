Clued Up
P O L I T I C A L S C I E N C E
Last term FELIX ran a news story
about Manor Askenazi's campaign
for 24 hour access to the
Department of Computing labs. I
would think that students, both
undergraduate and research,
would largely be in favour of it.
And there are arguments that can
be made, as long as one treats
students as grown-up, rational
beings, that access should not be
restricted to the so-called normal
working day.
Manor's campaign should
only be seen as a seed, and should
be taken up to open access to
College totally. Why should only
the Computing labs be open 24
hours a day? Open all the
laboratories, the libraries, the
shops, the bars, the restaurants.
Let members of College access and
use them when they want.The
argument for the whole access-
ability debate stems from this
simple fact: students are adults
(they pay rents, take out loans,
have bank accounts, etc). If they
want to ruin their lives by spending
24 hours drinking then let them. If
they want to ruin their health by
spending 24 hours in front of a
terminal, then who is College to
act as moral nanny? There are
practical considerations to full
accessability, but these do not
discount the basic libertarian
argument.
The whole issue is just an
example of College being run by
well behaved engineers: "A normal
working day is between the hours
of 9 and 5, why would anyone
want to work at night instead?"
Unfortunately, the 24-hour access
campaign may fizzle out because
Departments are largely populated
by well behaved engineers: "It
doesn't really effect me, why
should I care?" The idea of doing
something, anything, differently is
alien. Why do you want to take this
route, when everyone else takes
that one and has always taken it, is
the bewildered question.
The irony of the whole thing
is that science is sold as a liberator;
something which allows one to
move ahead with new concepts.
The argument of the science
educators, "why do you want it like
this, when it's always been done
like that?", sounds like Middle
England on Nick Ross. I originally
started off by thinking that
orthodoxy was a scheme, a
dogma. But it's not: it's just
escapism. "Yes, yes, it really will be
alright once we all get back to
those days of aunts cycling down
the church lane in the afternoon
sun."

Guest columnists respond to
Samin's recent accusations ...
Organised Piffle:
T.H.Huxley described science as
"organised common sense". In the
same vein, Bertrand Russell
described philosophy as "organised
piffle". Doubtless in order to
exemplify this profound aphorism,
Russell devised the parable of the
'inductivist turkey'. On the very first
morning of the day that it was
hatched, a young turkey noticed
that the farmer brought him and
his siblings food at 9:00 am. The
same thing happened on the
second day, the third day and so
on, until one day the turkey
induced that "We will always be
fed at 9:00 am.". Sadly on that
very same day, he had his throat
cut, for it was Christmas.
Russell created this parable
in order to discredit inductive logic.
For the same reason this parable
was adopted by Popper, and by all
others who want to discredit the
general validity of the scientific
truth, objectivity and method. The
parable was most recently repeated
by Samin in FELIX (1018). Note that
all these people failed to see that
against induction they all the time
argued inductively! But let this pass.
However, how sound is the
'logic' of the 'inductivist turkey'? Is
it in the same class as the logic
employed by Galileo, Newton, and
Huxley? Is it as valid as the logic
routinely used by surgeons
performing successful operations,
or by engineers who build real,
successful aircraft?
Anyhow, even the likes of
Russell and Popper, when it really
mattered, abided by all inductive
laws that needed obeying in order
to stay alive: they never cut across
the path of speeding trucks; they
never jumped unprotected from
great heights; and so on. Both
Russell and Popper lived well into
their nineties.
It may even be significant
that in the parable, Russell had a
turkey to serve as his spokes-
person. We suspect that Russell's
subconsciousness somehow played
a role here. What it seems is that
Russell's subconscious mind is
crying out to tell us this: "I,
Bertrand Russell, have the brain of
a bird!".
We trust that there are many
people in Imperial College who
have developed cognitive faculties
on a higher evolutionary plane
than those of a bird, and who also
have the wit to use them.
