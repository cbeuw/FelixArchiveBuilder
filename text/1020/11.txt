Here's a problem - you have half a page in a
large circulation student newspaper, a theme
of Valentine's Day and two days. What would
you do? How about paying a visit to the new
Infinite Monkey House at London Zoo with a
contract from I B M word processors (got to
keep up with the times) and see what you
come up with? Or maybe you would stumble
through with the usual disjointed musings
and 'just be yourself Hollywood morals. Or
possibly you could opt for the freshly
tarnished camera tapping deconstruction of
the medium angle, as I obviously have.
Accident
The first thing must surely to do a little
background research. The facts must be
known before they can be h i d d e n and
distorted again. Unfortunately the only fact
available on the good St Valentine heralded by
the dusty reference section of F E L I X
T O W E R S was that his association with
passion laden anonymous outpourings was a
'historical accident'. A historical accident?
Did the mighty scholars of yesteryear falter in
their relentless crusade for the truth? D i d
some sinner want to plant a proverbial
skeleton in Valentine's cupboard? Possible St
Valentine was, well, a bit randy and got
caught.
In Bed Staring
Whatever the truth may be, he has left a
legacy. No other occasion has such a wide
participance i n an activity of pure and
beautiful motive - simply to finally inform
those who have been making your life a
complex, inexplicable, delicious misery what
you really feel because you were always too
frightened. Anonymously. You send them a
card or a letter with your most personal,
vulnerable rantings to finally resolve the
problem, but you don't sign it hoping that
somehow they will know. You wish that your
feelings could transmit on the sub ether and
that when you next spy them and catch their
eyes for that extra few milliseconds before
turning back to your rugby songs or noisy
celibate friend that you will have reached a
new landmark in your relationship.
Yet in the back of your mind, as you lie
in bed staring at the pink sky, you know that
some suave confident type has whisked up
your special person with no regard for their
feelings only to leave them so much poorer
and about as tall as whale droppings a few
weeks later. If only you had told them - you
would never hurt them, you know how to
really look after them. Unless you are that
suave confident individual, in which case you
are probably the cause of more confused
internal brooding than, errr... metaphors fail
me. Git.
We C rave
So why then do we indulge i n an almost
pseudo-religious ritual of twanging the heart
strings? There is a theory that events like this
evolve because actual religion is on the
decline, but it's not a very interesting one.
Could it be that it is the very uncertainty and
doubt that we crave, the continual internal
struggle, would he, wouldn't he, placing the
very dearest motives of your life in the hands
of luck? No, I don't think so. We are simply
horridly timid and terrible at controlling the
really important things in our lives. However
brash, busy, enthusiastic and expert someone
can get over football, physics or similar utterly
trivial pastimes, when it comes to jobs,
partners, friends, and to a lesser extent money,
we blindly blunder into every obstacle in our
path, choosing instead to focus our planning
and thought to things of no real consequence
whatsoever.
Maybe this is why politicians are so
frighteningly incompetent...
