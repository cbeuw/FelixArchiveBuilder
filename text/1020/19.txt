Valentine's Day is upon us once
again. People often live in a mild
state of tension and fear; hoping
that for the first time in years they
will receive a small token of love
from a secret admirer. If, like me,
you have prepared yourself for
another barren day, then you may
be able to seek some comfort from
August Sfrindberg's play, the
dance of death, running at the
Almeida Theatre.
The play, written in 1 900, is a
deeply pessimistic insight into
marriage at a time when there
was generally no 'get out clause'.
It centres around an aging couple
living on a small island off the
Swedish coast who are nearing
their silver wedding anniversary.
John Neville (who played the
Baron in 'the Adventures of Baron
Munchausen') is the arrogant
Captain and Alice [Gemma Jones)
is his emotionally tortured wife.
Together they seem to have
reached the conclusion that they
were destined to bring each other
misery.
A recurrent theme throughout
the production is that both Alice
and the Captain are constantly
belittling the other and blaming
them for a marital life of suffering.
When Kurt (Anthony O'Donnell),
an old friend, arrives on the island
it appears as though a cease-fire
could be reached. However, the
manipulative couple only succeed
in corrupting the arbitrator and
creating even more pain.
Such is the bitterness of
Strindberg's characters that one is
not sure if the play is a tragedy or
a comedy. Indeed, at times the
production is quietly amusing and
the audience is even encouraged
to laugh. Strindberg was of the
opinion that men and women are
bonded by sex, not love, and that
it was normal to dislike, even
despise one's partner.
There is, however, a more
humane and sensitive side to the
characters. This allows a
sympathetic tolerance to prevail
and it is here that the actors come
into their own. John Neville, in
particular, gives a brilliantly
controlled performance of a
clearly unstable man.
Maybe, because I'm a
romantic or just somewhat naive, I
find Strindberg's portrayal of
marriage hard to swallow and I
disagree that it has to be so
miserable. If, however, I fail to
receive any valentine's cards this
year I may reassess my view. 0

How is it that when The Nerd has
finally become fashionable, IC still
manages to remove 'The' and
relegate the ' N ' to lower case ?
Face it, 95 is the chance to make
the place famous. With male
model pay packets on the
increase, and the men's fashion
industry booming, more and more
opportunities are arising for the
pigeon toed and concave-chested
nerds. IC, here you go ... forget
the merchant banking, Marcus
Schenkenberg (Calvin Klein jeans
boy) is taking Â£1,000 for a single
show. And who could be more
perfect for the Nerd model of 95
than the typical IC boy. Precision
training.
But seriously, there's a big
market for real people right now,
and the less butch or physically
attractive you are the better your
chance of success. Models One
are on the look out for thin,
beautiful, girlish models with
bobbed hair ... sound familiar? If
not then try Paris where to be the
rage is to be 5 foot 2 with pink
hair and a goatee beard. (Oops,
getting a little too daring for IC
there). In France, apparently,
'idiosyncrasy' is a valued trait. I'm
sure that the occasional smile
could lift even downright
weirdness to equally dizzy heights
of fame and fortune. Student
hardship could be a thing of the
past. IC, instead of being the blot
on ULU's social landscape, could
become an icon not just of
education but of style. Women,
allegedly, may even start sending
their knickers thru' the post. Yes, i
said 'women'. Q

O r o t a
tiQ n Their distinctive guitar-based
sound is well used so that not
all of the songs sound exactly
the same. This lot will go far.
rockers hi fi - what a fife
On this cd single, there are five
versions of this song (lucky me)
and they all sound the same.
Mind you, it is actually quiet
catchy. I found myself trying to
imitate the ridiculous singing
quite often. Sad I know.
shampoo - delicious
Another class song from the
queens of pop music. With its
sweet tones and wonderful
lyrics, if leaves you feeling
fulfiled and at peace with
yourself so you can face up to
another demanding day. Oh
bugger! Some men in white
coats are putting me in a very
restraining jacket here ... help
Round and round he goes like
a spinning top ... the week's
releases according to AJofc
await your pleasure.
supergrass - mansize rooster
This is brilliant) Nice to see
another gem from Supergrass
after 'caught by the fuzz'.
del amifri - here and now
Ah ... good old Dell A nice
almost country-style ballad
performed in good old Del
style. Gets a bit boring after
the third or fourth time but
worth listening to if a friend's
got it. live in Nashville on
especially good.
