We smell. Glands centred around our armpits, ears, eyelids, genitals, and lips
constantly emit fragrant and alluring chemical messengers known as pheromones.
But do we know how to interpret the messages?
Although BO is preferable to many of the Superdrug alternatives, the evidence
suggests that we hate our natural smell. Anyone who has ever been left choking by a
too-liberal handful of Lynx will know that there never was a greater misnomer than
"deodorant".
But natural pheromones are widely used by other species to attract mating partners. Fish,
spiders, pigs, tortoises and even millipedes make full use of their aromatic firepower - as well as
their numerous other charms - to get their other half in the mood.
Why shouldn't we use the same cunning plan? Mysteriously enough, we mimic these lowly
lifeforms rather more closely than we might have liked to think.
After scrubbing our natural odours away, we replace them with perfumes and deodorants that
often contain natural or synthetic animal pheromones. What's more, the favoured pheromones are
usually those that would have served as nostril tickling titillators to their original owners.
Musk, for example, has been used in both male and female perfumes for over 3000 years.
Although musk-like chemicals can now be synthesised, musk took its name from the musk deer
from whose intimate glands it was originally extracted.
All of which gives me a very original idea for a perfume advertisement...

By the time you're 25, you'll have seen 10,000 murders on screen. This may be
nothing compared to the number of kisses you've seen, but that probably
depends whether the last film you saw was
Four Weddings and a Funeral or
Reservoir Dogs.
Kissing first hit the
cinema screen in Queen
Victoria's reign, when
even the slightest show
of physical affection
provoked outrage. In
comparison, modern
media leave very
little to the
imagination, but
that didn't prevent
huge interest when
Roseanne and
Sandra Bernhardt
snogged on
primetime T V .
Kissing is a
human activity
charged with meaning.
The lips are richly
supplied with nerve
endings feeding straight
into the largest area of the
sensory cortex, and it is this fact
that accounts for kissing's
continuing popularity.
There's extra good news for slimmers as well, because according to Focus Magazine, "a
really steamy snogging session can burn off up to 150 calories". This, apparently, is the
equivalent of doing the front crawl for 15 minutes.
Or is that a euphemism?
