Arty Farty
Freedom Cafe is exhibiting
the winners and the weird
entries to the Stella Dry
Mixed Media competition.
The brief said simply 'strong
yet light in taste'. The win-
ner shows a woman laying
on a bed with a bottle of
Stella and a dictophone. It is
named after Joseph Pujal,
famous for his ability to fart
well known tunes. No prizes
for guessing what the dicta-
phone is being used for.

Fipple
Meaning: the mouth-
piece of a wind instru-

Example: Just before

began to remove the
fipple from his trachea,
Sandy decided to give
up both trampolining
and playing the
recorder.
