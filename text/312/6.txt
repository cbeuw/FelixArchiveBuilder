An Entertaining Term
Here's a nice little piece of bull on behalf of
the Entertainments Committee which has this term
laid on a splendid selection of concerts especially
with the IC student in mind. Forgive me if I give
the impression of being a little over enthusiastic
but as Ents did not make the substantial profit
anticipated this time last year, we want to con-
vince the maximum number of gullible FRESHERS
how worthwhile it will be to come to all of them.
Freshers' Hop this
Saturday features Fair-
port Convention. The
lineup of the group is
uncertain at the time of
writing but rumours are
afoot that some of the
former members who
left will be returning for
this concert. Be sure
you can all groove along,
have a good stomp and
show off your trendy
clothes you haven't
worn in London yet.
Even if you bury your
head in books for the
rest of the year, don't
miss this one — we
need your money.
October 14th sees
DHS-One at the college.
This new group features
Dick Heckstall - Smith
formerly of Colosseum
and this fact alone
should be enough to
pack out the Great Hall.
If you can't decide to
come or not, play Colos-
seum's 'Valentine Suite'
at 45 r.p.m. — second
thoughts it sounds even
better at the right speed.
This will bias you.
No jokes about Octo-
ber 21 st's concert, folks
it's the Phantom of Rock
Lou Reed whose first
'solo' album received
rave reviews from most
of pop's intellectuals
and whose role in the
Velvet Underground is
legendary. Who knows?
He may play "Heroin"
or even "Sister Rag",
but even if he doesn't
it should be an historic
evening.
There will be an old-
fashioned teeny - bop -
style hop on October
28th, hopefully in the
Union. Anyone who saw
them last term will tes-
tify that they're a good
band to shake your ass
to. There should be a
disco as well. Then it's
back to heavies for the
next three weeks. On
November 4th we have
Status Quo who we be-
lieve (and hope) are
phenomenally popular on
the "musically inept but
good to move to" cir-
cuit. "I'm looking for-
ward to it," says Dude
Ravers (Elec. Eng. IV).
Osibisa play on Novem-
ber 11th and as with Roy
Young, no one who saw
them last year will want
to miss the "criss-cross
rhythms that explode
with happiness."
The word is out for
Genesis. By the time
they play the Great Hall
on November 18th their
new album "Foxtrot"
will be out and they will
be one of Britain's great
new discoveries. The
lead singer is believed
(and I quote) to make
David Bowie and Alice
Cooper look like last
year's tat. Ooh! Cheeky
bitch. The rest of the
group make good music,
by the way, but of
course that's of secon-
dary importance these
days.
Believe me, it's not
easy writing pseudy crap
like the above. I shall
finish by stating that
other groups proposed
for later this term in-
clude Argent, Brett Mar-
vin and the Dinosaurs
(sorry Terry Dactyl and
the Thunderbolts) and
the Kinks. Look out for
Ents posters for details. Mike as he appeared at a 1969 Union General Meeting
be colour,
but. . .
Contrary to the expectations of your depart-
ment during your College life, you will not want
to study all the time. Freshers' Fair gives you
the chance to join many clubs and societies for
recreation and sport, but you will also want to be
entertained and kept informed about College and
Union affairs. A s well as Felix, another student
"organ of communication" exists. Imperial Col-
lege Union has been wise enough to finance its
own television service: Student Television of Im-
perial College.
STOIC complements
the broadcast channels
by presenting films, ma-
gazine programmes and
news for IC students
alone. It's not just neigh-
bourhood TV though, for
on STOIC you can see
programmes from other
colleges and offbeat
commercial films of stu-
dent interest.
Here is the pro-
gramme schedule—the
weeks alternate.
This week:
Tuesday 12.30 p.m.:
Popular feature film
series, to include "Goal"
(1966 World Cup) and
the "Carry On" series.

chrome show. Producer
Tim Jeffs intends to
give you the inside story
of entertainment and the
arts, adding contribu-
tions from the Royal Col-
lege of Arts School of
Film and Television and
the BBC to STOIC inter-
views with musicians
and othei guests horn
the film and TV world.

lar Monochrome Show.
Next week:

Elliott, and How to Pass
Exams.

Where can you watch
STOIC? Well, the ser-
vice is relayed on chan-
nel 21 UHF to all TV
sets in Southside, both
the Union lounges and
the halls of residence.
It is also shown on a TV
monitor in the Junior
Common Room in Col-
lege Block.
I hope you enjoy the
programmes; if you do
not, then constructive
suggestions are not just
welcome, but essential,
if we are to provide a
truly tailor-made student
service.
In case you were wondering.
W h o ' s W H O ?
The Art of Mascotry might well appear to those re-
appearing here after the summer to have died a quite
natural death many moons ago. Perhaps it is to the
best that this should have happened, unless you are
yourself a keen mascotteer. However, it would seem
that, since this article has been submitted, that some
of the old spirit lingers on; and in the hope that some-
one amongst the freshers might be interested to read
of the history of IC mascotry, and also because we
are desperate to fill up space, the article has been
printed in full:
Once upon a time (well
all good stories begin that
way) before Imperial Col-
lege was a glint in the
Prince Consort's eye, there
were two colleges, the
Royal College of Chemis-
try in Oxford Street, and
the Museum of Practical
Geology in Jermyn Street.
And it came to pass
•that in 1872 the Govern-
ment School of Mining
and Science Applied to
the Arts acquired very
cheaply a building in
Exhibition Road built for
the Royal School of
Naval Architects in a
style which appears to be
a cross between a palace
and a battleship, and this
became the embryo of
I.C.
But even when joined
in Kensington by the
Central Technical College
to form the Imperial Col-
lege of Science and
Technology, the colleges
retained their own souls
even if grafted with a
new body, and those
souls did have an earthly
form which, after reincar-
nation, appeared in mod-
ern times as a thermo-
meter, a Davy lamp and
a spanner.
•Not content with one
mascot each, the students
of the colleges, who by
this time had found better
things to do than science,
mining or engineering,
continuously tried to bor-
row each others'. The
gentlemen (??—Ed.) of
the RCS however did
much better than either
Guilds or Mines who
eventually gave up, and
the RCS Wooden Horse
Club became the Imperial
College Wooden Horse
Organisation (or WFIO
for short). And the mem-
bers of WHO started bor-
rowing the mascots of
other London colleges.
We still have somewhere
(I believe) an Anchor
that once glowed in the
colours of the University
College and a ceramic
Owl of unknown antece-
dents.
But these colleges,
rightfully, started com-
plaining because WHO
was pinching their mas-
cots right, left and centre,
and had nothing of its
own to guard.
Many years before, IC
'had boasted a mascot . . .
a Phoenix called Herbert
(well, what would Y O U
call a phoenix?) after
which that well-known
literary (sic) magazine
"The Phoenix" was
named.
And this bird sat peace-
fully on its shelf until the
"Herbs" (its keepers—
RIP) were seduced by the
little people . . . in the
form of a couple of wen-
ches from some teacher
training college.
Determined to save the
next mascot from so ig-
noble a fate, the Union
chose Colcutt's tower to
replace Herbert. Surely a
tower with 60ft. piling was
almost unstealable?
In the meantime, the
Rifle Club had been sav-
ing its spent cartridge
cases and had sufficient to
manufacture a new totem
. . . a giant micrometer
screw gauge. Designed in
R.C.S., cast in Mines and
machined in Guilds'
"MIKE" was the finest
mascot in all London . . .
nay, Great Britain. The
task of safeguarding it
was entrusted to the
Electrical Engineers.
Within a few weeks Mike
was violated, taken to
University College, and set
in a block of ferroconcrete.
It was retrieved and
guarded. It spent some
time in exile in a bank
vault up in the North
while a fool (and student)
proof defence system was
devised.
It was replaced in the
Union Lower Lounge on
a plinth. It stayed safe be-
hind its steel clasps for a
couple of weeks and was
then violated again . . .
this time by Queen Mary
College. Realising that to
try and solve the prob-
lems of the multitudinous
Assa locks and combina-
tions was futile, they "lib-
erated" Mike using a cold
chisel and a sledge ham-
mer.
I await the return of
Mike, mascotry and a
"sporting spirit" to I.C.—
things that are epitomised
by the words of the col-
lege chant:
He Vivo
He Vivo
He Vivo Vivo Vo
He Efte Efte, Ho Ho
Efte,
Ingo Ingo Ho Ho Ho
repeated twice and then
IC, IC, IC (what a literary
masterpiece—Ed.).
Anybody interested in
Mascotry should leave a
note in the Union Rack
for WHO.
