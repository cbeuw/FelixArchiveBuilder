FRANK ZAPPA: "Waka/Jawaka" (WEA-Reprise)
Unless you're like me a total sucker for everything Frank Zappa commits
to record you probably wont have bought his recent releases "200 Motels"
and the adventures of Billy the Mountain and Ethel, the tree growing off
his shoulder must have been hard to take for the fans brought up on "King
K o n g " and "Willy the Pimp". I am pleased to announce, therefore, Zappa
freaks everywhere, that this album almost lives up to its subtitle "Hot Rats
Part 2".
" W a k a / J a w a k a " is
in part a step back in
the direction of "Hot
Rats" in that two of
the tracks, the title
song and " B i g Swifty"
are ten-minute-plus in-
strumentals. The dif-
ference is that while
tracks of this length on
"Hot Rats" generally
took the form of
theme-solo-theme the
RECORDS
subdivisions here are
considerably m o r e
subtle. " B i g Swifty"
which occupies the
whole of the first side
begins with rapid ex-
changes between Sal
Marques' multi-tracked
trumpet and you-know-
who's guitar, before
settling down to some
understated shrieks
(never heard of under-
stated shrieks before?)
from a mini-Moog (pre-
sumably) . G e o r g e
Duke's "ring-modulat-
e d " and echoplexed
electric piano" comes
floating down from no-
where and soon disap-
pears without you not-
icing, then Sal Marques
returns on trumpet and
takes up most of the
rest of the track sound-
ing like a saxophone,
conversing occasion-
ally with Zappa and
Duke, and backed up
by clanking drumming
from Aynsley Dunbar
until the original theme
returns, only now in a
different time signature
so that it isn't immed-
iately recognisable.
The track suggested to
me a bow in the direc-
tion of Miles Davies.
The two short tracks
which open side two,
"Your Mouth" and "It
might Just Be A One-
Shot Deal" are only as
Zappa-satire whose butt
is unknown. " D e a l " is
notable for a verse
sung with a Scottish
accent (now who the
hell is that directed
at?) and a rather nice
pedal steel solo from
Sneaky Pete Kleinow.
" W a k a / J a w a k a " has
a far more conventional
"big-band sound" to it
than " B i g Swifty". The
horn sound is much
fuller with Marques
being joined by three
sax players. I imagined
this on " S y d Lawrence
plays the best of Glenn
Miller's Greatest Hits"
until the characteristic
wak-wak guitar cuts in.
Towards the end of his
" s o l o " Zappa abandons
his pedal and plays
some of the straightest
"aural wallpaper" you
can imagine. Then
there's an eight-armed
drum solo from Dunbar
before the whole en-
semble returns and
fades away leaving (I
hope) all you Zappa
freaks everywhere opti-
mistic about the new
direction the maestro
has decided to take. If
"Chunga's Revenge"
was the last of his re-
cords which you bought
make this the next.
But what happened to
Suzy Creemcheese,
Frank?
No, Bob Dylan is not appearing in the theatre in London at the moment.
He's just here to balance up the page.
It is May; but as this review is not due to appear until October, I will
have to indulge in some hasty prophesy. By my estimation these following
Shows (that I have seen for FELIX over the past year) will still be running:
"Company" (Her
Majesty's) is the best
Musical running in
London. New York,
Marriage and Society
are given a pretty thor-
ough roughing-up in
this production, and
Sondheim's lyrics are,
simply, superb. I enjoy-
ed "Canterbury Tales"
(Phoenix) but mainly
because of the imagin-
ative sets (a weakness
of mine) and the lustre-
less " S h o w b o a t "
(Adelphi) is strictly for
the nostalgic who want
the hero to get his Gal.
Farces? A simple
choice of two for me.
" H o w the Other Half
Loves" (Lyric) just
holds pride of place
THEATRE
of
to
from " M o v e over Mrs.
Markham" (Vaudeville)
but only because of a
cleverer inceptive idea,
and both are very
funny. Actually, to my
mind, "The Mouse-
trap" (Ambassador's)
is best treated as a pur
ely amusing piece
writing, as it is not suf
ficiently well-clued
be a genuine who-
dunnit.
Apart from these, I
have reason to recom-
mend "The Philanthro-
pist" (Mayfair), (rave
reviews all round);
"Journey's E n d " , if
has transferred from
the Mermaid (it has —
to the Cambridge —
Ed.) and " S l e u t h " (St.
Martin's) which de-
it
serves to run twice as
long as "The Mouse-
trap" (work that out!)
But the best shall
wait until last . . .
and the two plays that
I recommend above all
are " G o d s p e l I"
(Wyndham's) in which
the Gospels are given
an energetic, beauti-
fully un-Blasphemous
(I believe) re-working;
and "Jumpers" (in
rep at the Old Vic) in
which Tom Stoppard
has created an end-
lessly amusing play,
which curls and twists
upon itself to obscure
initially, and reveal ul-
timately, a core of
great significance. But
the greatest of these is
"Godspell'.
THE REVIEWS PAGE
This year's FELIX review page will continue to feature Rec-
ords, Theatre, Films and Rock Concerts. In addition it is plan-
ned to include reviews of Paperback books (see below), Clas-
sical Records, Concerts, TV and Radio. To do this, we need
reviewers for most of these. If you would like to review for
FELIX, please contact us — see advertisement on page 5.
"About Sex" by Claire Rayner (Fontana)
Perhaps it would be a little cruel to say that sex by Claire lacked any real
bite or definition purely because it was written by a woman: however, all
the way through the book, Claire Rayner tended to shy away from the real
controversies in 20th century sex.
The most annoying
example of this is the
paragraph ' Illegal
Practices", where she
says " A s anal inter-
course is illegal, even
between husband and
wife in privacy, it is
not possible here to
make any comments
about the desirability
or otherwise of the
practice". Ends.
I found the section
on abortions slightly
biased against them —
mainly because some
of the more modern
techniques in abor-
tions which have con-
siderably improved
and quickened abor-
tions were not cov-
ered.
However, compared
to a large number of
sex encyclopaedias
available, "About S e x "
definitely falls on the
liberal side. But it cer-
tainly wasn't "Out-
spoken . . . a remark-
able new guide" as is
proclaimed by the
PAPERBACKS
"News of the W o r l d "
review of the original
hardback edition prin-
ted on the cover.
"A Dictionary of
Drugs" by Richard
Fisher and George
Christie (Paladin)
A dictionary of
drugs is definitely no
more than it claims to
be, nothing more than
a dictionary — try and
read this and all you
will get is tangled up
in chemical equations
and medical jargon. In
my brief look through
this book I was im-
pressed by the un-
biased and accurate
(so far as I could tell)
reporting of the fifty-
six different drugs list-
ed. In the Introduction
the authors are quick
to point out that they
are dealing w i t h
"drugs" —- "not nar-
cotics, drugs in gen-
eral — therapeutically
useful chemicals, for
the treatment of dis-
ease".
This doesn't mean
that they have avoided
covering important
controversial social
drugs such as canna-
bis or Lysergic acid
diethylamide.
Each drug is cov-
ered in its own indi-
vidual section. The
drug, its effects and
its uses are explained
in a simple easily un-
derstood manner while
the chemistry and phy-
siology are a little
more difficult to ex-
plain.
If you want to know
what the physician is
pouring or pumping in-
to your body then this
is the book to have
stacked behind your
pills and hypodermics.
