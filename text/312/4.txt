Page 4 FELIX 2nd October, 1972
T
HE prospect of having a Presi-
dential election in only three
weeks' time is frightening in
some respects, and welcome
in others. It is welcome in that
there will now be some real action
in the first term (and FELIX will have
some news to print). Those of you who
are new to Imperial College will have
the chance to see at first hand how our
system operates, instead of waiting with
bated breath and eager anticipation for
March. In fact, you will all have the
fun of having two elections in the same
year, and it is almost certain that the
second will be the most interesting.
The frightening part of it is trying to
figure out who will stand for the post.
It is too early for rumours, and indeed
too late also, for the nomination forms
are now up. Last year's election of
Chris Sheppard was almost a foregone
conclusion. The only opponents were
a Socialist Society candidate (who
managed to get a quite respectable
number of votes, but probably only be-
cause he managed to conceal very
carefully that he was a SocSoc candi-
date) and two complete outsiders. This
time it is impossible to predict at this
stage any candidate of the "old school"
(alias the McCullough - Sheppard
Liberal Party) who is likely to stand.
One can be fairly certain that SocSoc
EDITORIAL
will put up a candidate, and it is quite
readily conceivable that either he (or
she) could get in. It might be a very
interesting year. . .
I
T is not a vintage year for accom-
modation. You might well be re-
gretting that you ever came here,
and didn't take up that option on
a place at a university in the Hebrides
or wherever. Nevertheless, it would
probably have been the same story
there. The only places with no accom-
modation problem are those colleges
like Royal Holloway which have com-
pulsory 100 per cent hall accommoda-
tion at £210 per annum all in. You
might also be surprised to hear that,
after Royal Holloway, Imperial has
the lowest hall fees in London Univer-
sity. That does not solve the problem.
This year the 3,000 of you who can-
not be put up in IC accommodation
will have to pay more than £6 a week
for your room only in furthest subur-
bia. It is more than a problem to find
accommodation even at higher prices
than that. There are few solutions to
the problem. Putting up the grant ona
cost-of-living basis is surely the best
from our point of view. However, the
basis would have to be a special index
for students, since the cost of accom-
modation here has been going up at a
far faster rate than the ordinary cost-
of-living index. Whether this would
solve the problem in the long run,
though, is dubious . . . prices would
probably rise faster than before.
The government has hit upon a very
simple scheme for them to operate. It
would undoubtedly solve the problem
in the long run, but in the process
would not only destroy the concept of
a university, but alienate still further
students from the government . . . and,
for once, their parents too.
I am referring to the home-based
students plan. The government has
asked the Vice-Chancellors to give pre-
ference to students who would live at
home during the academic year. If the
system is accepted and becomes uni-
versal, everyone would go to their local
university, and presumably even the
halls would become redundant. One
presumes that the usual exceptions for
medical schools and Oxford and Cam-
bridge would apply.
The best alternative is to build
enough halls of residence to accommo-
date everybody. This is by no means as
silly as it sounds. If the government
will not cough up the money (and no-
body supposes that they will), the
clearing banks will probably only be
too keen to. The halls would thus be
built on a system of "loan finance".
The new Northside hall at IC is being
built on this financing system. Since
the college owns the land here, it may
as well build as much as possible on
the space available, and then make the
number of places up to the required
number (by the time it could come
around it would probably be 6,000
places) by building out in the coun-
try . . . for example, on some of the
spare (and cheap) land around Heath-
row Airport, which is very easily acces-
sible from I.C. Everyone will have to
swallow their objections to travelling
a distance and to loan finance. It's
worth making sacrifices to solve the
accommodation problem.
You all know that you are now a member of Imperial College Union. You will rapidly find out, if you haven't already, that
you are also a member of your constituent college union — Royal College of Science, City and Guilds' College or Royal School
of Mines Union. But it doesn't end there. You are also automatically a member of the National Union of Students and the Univer-
sity of London Union. So what? Read on and find o u t » . .
By the end of this week,
all you freshmen will have
been (we hope) well and
truly indoctrinated into
Imperial College Union.
Having spent many a
happy hour at the Fresh-
ers' Fair, the Union Re-
ception Evening, depart-
mental receptions et al,
and having drunk your fill
of Mooney sherry at the
reception meetings organ-
ised by those dozens of
clubs that you joined at
the Fair, you might well
shy away from the idea of
going to another Freshers'
Fair.
The one that we're talk-
ing about is the University
of London Union one. Be-
lieve it or not, besides
being a member of Im-
perial College Union, your
constituent college union,
the National Union of Stu-
dents, you are also a mem-
ber of ULU.
Well, so what IS ULU?
For a start, it's an enor-
mous building in Malet
Street, WC1. right by the
Senate House (the admin-
istrative centre of London
University), which forms a
meeting place for students
from all the constituent
colleges that make up the
University. At the mo-
ment, it is relatively un-
frequented by Imperial
College students, probably
because it is quite a dis-
tance away, but repays a
visit, if only because you
may as well take advant-
age of everything that you
can get free . . .there's not
very much in London!
ULU runs a large num-
ber of sports and social
clubs. Its sports clubs are
generally for sportsmen of
very high standard to
compete in inter-university
competitions, but they
also do have clubs for be-
ginners, especially in those
sports which constituent
college unions do not offer.
So, if either you're a top-
notch sportsman, or want
to start in some sport
which we don't do here
at IC, go along to U L U
and find out about it
there.
The social clubs include
all the usual ones, like
Chess and Transcendental
Meditation, but especially
cater for our international
friends here in national
societies.
What else is there at
ULU? Well, there's a very
good (and inexpensive) res-
taurant which operates
just about all day (and so
it's very handy for a bite
if you're up in Central
London), a bar (inevit-
ably!), common rooms, a
TV lounge, music rooms
(with massive selection of
records and all the equip-
ment), etc, etc. And of
course the meeting rooms
for all the societies (now
including the LSPA).
The best way of finding
out what ULU offers is to
go along and see for your-
self. They are running a
"Freshers' Fair" (oh no,
not. another!!) next Mon-
day and Tuesday, 9th and
10th October, at which
every club and society will
be represented. There'll
even be rowing and canoe-
ing demonstrations in the
swimming pool (anything
for a laugh).
So why not go along?
You've nothing to lose ex-
cept your 15p tube fare (to
Goodge Street or Russell
Square) and not only
should you find out what
happens there, but meet
some of your colleagues
from other colleges (there
are also rather more
women there than there
are at IC!!)
Being honest, the Nat-
ional Union of Students is
really a political union.
Imperial College Union
isn't. Unfortunately, the
chances are that even if
you're politically minded,
the NUS's politics will not
be compatible with your
own, but you will have to
find this out for yourself.
At the moment the execu-
tive is on a "Communist"
ticket, whatever that may
mean, but, needless to say
of a union claiming to
represent 51)0,000 very dif-
ferent students, there are
many factions within it.
You will hear enough of
the NUS's politics when
the November National
Conference at Margate
comes around, so until
then the subject can lie.
What functions do the
NUS perform?
Operating from a dere-
lict terrace house in End-
sleigh Street, the NUS has
almost ceased to organise
"demonstrations" as such:
the new term is "Day of
Action". The next one, if
you like that sort of thing,
is the "Day of Action on
Education" on October
28th. ("Felix" will carry
full details on October
24th).
The NUS operates many
services. The best known
are the Travel Service and
Endsleigh Insurances. Both
of these operate in compe-
tition with commercial
concerns. The travel ser-
vice operates and organises
charter flights to all parts
of the world throughout
the holiday seasons at
heart-breaking (if you're a
scheduled carrier) prices.
Not only flights, but trains,
boats and coaches as well.
It's probably safe to say
that wherever you have a
desire to go, NUS Travel
Service can fix you up, at
incredibly low cost.
Endsleigh Insurances
Ltd. is a subsidiary com-
pany of the NUS, and
operates as an insurance
brokerage. That is, they
will ring round all the in-
surance companies for
quotes for whatever kind
of insurance you want,
and offer you the best (or
cheapest) to suit your
needs. They also have spe-
cial schemes for students
for certain kinds of insur-
ance, for example motor
insurance, travel insurance
and property insurance.
The NUS has a very
busy legal department
which can advise you free
of charge on any legal
mess that you might get
yourself into. There is a
scheme for legal aid
through NUS too. The
National Union of Stu-
dents can indeed advise
you on everything that will
affect you during your
career as a student, with
the notable and obvious
exception of telling you
how to pass your exams.
Other important depart-
ments arc those dealing
with grants and accommo-
dation problems.
Besides all these ser-
vices, your NUS card also
entitles you to substantial
discounts at many stores
and organisations, especi-
ally in London. The "Dis-
count Directory" is pub-
lished annually price 18p,
and you can consult a
copy in the Union Office.
Haven't, got your NUS
card yet? Well, you're en-
titled to it, so take a pass-
port photo of yourself
along to the IC Union
Office and they'll issue you
one.
National Union of Stu-
dents of the United King-
dom, 3 Endsleigh Street,
