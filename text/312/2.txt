MARTIN'S BIT
Welcome back to Imperial College to a/another* year of eat-
ing in Victor Mooney's Epicurean Emporiums, drinking in the
Union Bar (even if you're a lady but not after Freshers' Dinners
please), sleeping — or if you're really keen doing the Guardian
Crossword — in lectures, playing croquet beneath Queen's Tower,
drinking in Southside Bar, pancake races in the Beit Quad, BIG
name groups in the Great Hall, having "unauthorised overnight
guests" in Southside Rooms, quorate Union meetings (please,
please let them be quorate) and drinking in the new College Block
Bar.
This year's MARTIN'S
BIT will be printed, not in
the RCS Broadsheet, but
in the new weekly FELIX;
it will still be witty, infor-
mative, original, a mirror
of the Union Bureaucracy
and of course factually ac-
curate. It will enable mem-
bers of the Union to know
exactly what events are
worth going to — apart,
of course, from those an-
nual favourites such as
Commemoration Day (this
year 26th October),
Morphy Day (the Inter-
collegiate Boat Race, com-
plete with audience parti-
cipation), the Mines Ball,
the Engineers D and D,
the ICWA formal, the
Constituent College initia-
tions, the Silwood Ball—
but then, perhaps I'm
biased.
Life at IC will continue
to have style. It might
even regain some of the
style, not to mention tra-
ditions, lost under recent
regimes. It would gladden
the heart of many an old
man to see the return of
MIKE to public display
on its plinth, once we get
it back from that nasty
Queen Mary College. The
Rugger Club will continue
to thrash all opposition
(except perhaps the ICWA
team) and retain the Gut-
teridge Cup. There will
always be one gas lamp
in the City of Westmin-
ster burning brightly out-
side the Computing Build-
ing, but alas, those which
cast a yellow glow over
the facades of Prince Con-
sort Road are no more.
Even now, as I write this,
sitting in my red- swivel
chair in the queue which
stretches past the Beit
Arch, wending its way to-
wards the Last Night of
the Proms at the Albert
Hall, the serfs and minions
of Westminster City Coun-
cil are uprooting Imperial
Albert's gas standards.
But to business and that
which is foremost in IC is
that of . . .
Elections
There are perhaps
rather more elections in
the coming weeks than
normal at the beginning of
the session. Apart from
finding a new President
(see page 1) the Union
must fill some other of-
fices, the holders of which
have fallen by the way-
side during the summer
vacation. I feel that per-
haps the simplest or
rather least confusing ac-
count is in the form of an
election timetable.

T h e Miscellaneous
Posts are predominantly
Ordinary Members of Sub-
Committees of Council
and do not really need list-
ing. It is sufficient to say
that anybody who wants
a job can have one or
more to his taste.
All members of the
Union are entitled and in-
vited to nominate candi-
dates who are Full Mem-
bers of the Union for any
of the posts (excluding
Elec. Eng. Dept. Rep.,
which is different. Con-
fusing).
If somebody under-
stands the new voting
schedule will they explain
it to me as soon as pos-
sible, and in any case be-
fore the election — other-
wise it may be several
months before the results
are announced.
