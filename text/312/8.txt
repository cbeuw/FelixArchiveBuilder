HI
i
From next week the sportsmen of the college will be
grabbing the back side of FELIX. Don't let us get away
without printing the Sports Page. There will, however,
only be a Sports Page if those sports people amongst you
get your collective finger out and get the Editor some copy
by Friday 1100 hrs at latest. Photos, too, if you've got
them, please. Please don't write more than 1,000 words
per article unless you have advance clearance.
How about you social clubs too? Like chess, gliding,
Model Aircraft, Astrosoc, J Soc, YHA, etc., etc.??? If you
do things, we've got room to print something about you
. . . not necessarily on this page, but on another perhaps.
Ring the Editor and have a chat about how YOU can
be included in FELIX . . . internal phone 2488.
Been registered
lately ?
quired by law to enter the
names of all those who are
normally resident at that
place on 10th October.
The law permits a person
to be registered in more
than one place, e.g. his
parents' home and his col-
lege address, although, of
course, he may only vote
once in any election. Thus
you can vote once only in
general elections, but in
both places in the case of
local elections. You should
therefore be registered at
your lodgings address in
London, and also at your
home address (if different).
In case you missed out,
or got missed out, you can
go to the local post office
on November 28th or
thereafter and consult the
proposed register. If your
name is not on it, it is not
You might well be
totally bored with poli-
tics, but nevertheless,
should a general election
be called, most of you
would probably like to
vote. After all you may
as well . . . it's no good
complaining about who's
got in if you haven't
voted.
Well, now is the time to
register to be permitted to
vote in the coming year.
Even if there isn't a gen-
eral election (and, let's
face it, it's very unlikely)
there will definitely be
local elections coming up.
Come October 10th, a
form code-named "Form
A." will be distributed to
all householders (this in-
cludes landladies and Hall
wardens). They are re-
too late to have this situ-
a tion changed, but you
must inform the local Elec-
toral Registration Officer
of the details by Decem-
ber 16th.
As you must all know,
any British subject over
the age of eighteen is en-
titled to vote. However, if
you are not yet eighteen,
but will be before 15th
February, 1974, your name
must be included on the
Register.
So check that your Hall
warden or landlady puts
your own personal form—
when it arrives. If you live
in a flat, you should get
your own personal form
make sure that it arrives !
Now I wonder what's on

STEWED FELIX
Thte recipe is the first of a
m occasional series of exotic dishes that can be cooked
easily on two hotplates with two saucepans, and can therefore be prepared with
no problems in a hall galley. The dishes that we will be featuring are quite inex-
pensive (compared to going out and eating it) provided that you can con several
other people into helping you eat it. . . it's very uneconomic to cook like this for
less than 3 people. So given this basic requirement, a couple of spare hours and the
desire to poison yourself, you too can enjoy the wonders of
B o e u f B o u r g u i n o n n e
Ingredients: (for four people)
2 oz Lard or Butter or Marg.
1 medium onion, chopped
5 oz pack of Frozen Peas
\\ lbs Stewing Steak
Very small can Tomato Puree
pt (at least I) red wine
4 oz flour
Black Pepper
Teaspoon mixed herbs (Italian
Seasoning)
Beef stock cube
8 oz Patna-type rice
Teaspoonjul salt
Water \
Method
Take either a 7 in. or
bigger saucepan or an 8
in. frypan, and wash it up
from last time you used it.
Sorry, you'll have to get
rid of all that bacon fat
you've been lovingly pre-
serving in your frypan for
the last three years . . .
we need it CLEAN. (If
you need to borrow mild
green liquid for this, please
do so with our permission
. . . but ask whoever owns
it first!) Now melt the lard
or butter or marg (butter's
best) in the pan and saute
(that means gently fry) the
chopped onion, restraining
your tears, 'cos you need
to see to do the next bit.
Being a thoughtful lad (or
lady) you'll have chopped
the stewing steak into 1 in.
(sorry, 25.4 mm) cubes
before you started frying
(sorry, sauteing) the onion,
sprinkled pepper all over
it (the meat) and rolled it
(the meat again) in the
flour. Going back to the
pan and the merrily-saute-
ing onions . . . when the
latter are nicely golden,
add the meat and fry for
3 or 4 minutes, turning
frequently. Then add the
tomato puree, peas, wine
(buy a bottle of the cheap-
est you can find, and drink
what you don't use . . . if
you can stand the flav-
our!?), mixed herbs (sold

McC*rm*ck brand as "Ita-
lian Seasoning"), a n d
stock (made up of ^pt.
boiling water and the stock
cube crumbled into it).
Bring to boil. Recoil
wildly at the odour as it
pervades not only the gal-
ley but the whole of the
hall (or flat, or whatever)
as well, set the heat to
simmer (i.e. just keep the
mixture slightly bubbling)
and let it do just that for
about 45 minutes, by
which time the meat
should be nicely tender
and the juice should have
cooked down to about f pt.
of some of the most deli-
cious gravy you have ever
tasted. About 20 minutes
before the meal is due to
be ready, start cooking the
rice. If you are vaguely
eastern, or have eastern
training, or happen to have
an eastern origin friend,
you won't need me to tell
you how to cook rice. If
you can't cook rice with-
out it going stodgy
though, as I couldn't this
time last year, it's best
really to tr,y the English
method. To do this, fill up
a big enough (probably
7in. or bigger) saucepan to
within an inch or two of
the top with water, add a
teaspoonful of salt, and
bring to the boil. When it
is boiling, "rain" the rice
into the water, so that it
never goes off the boil.
Then boil the rice as
fiercely as you can without
boiling yourself as well
until it's cooked. This
should take between 12
15 minutes . . . after 12
minutes, keep testing the
rice. When it is cooked to
your satisfaction, fill up
the saucepan to brim-full
with COLD water and
leave for a minute or two.
Then drain off the water
and, hey presto . . . soggy
rice again ! (It should be
fluffy, actually . . . it works
for me!).
Now for the moment of
truth when you serve it up
. . . and wait to find out
what everyone else thinks
of it. (NB speaking from
experience of cooking this
in a student house last year
. . . you had better guard
the dish all the time that
it's cooking, otherwise you
won't have any left to
eat!).
Cost: roughly 30p per
head.
We hope that you enjoy
it . . . if you don't, write
and tell us why. And why
don't you contribute your
favourite recipe . . . how-
ever simple or complicated
it is, no matter, as long as
it can be cooked without
too much difficulty on a
Hall galley-type stove. If
it's edible (and every
recipe will be tested) we'll
print it in a coming issue.
Happy gourmandising!
