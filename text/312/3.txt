For a four week season only, it's
Ian Mackenzie's
President's Piece
The beginning of the Academic year, a
time when everyone writes articles starting
with 'Welcome to Imperial College' (Whoops,
done it again!) is a good time to have a look at
Imperial College Union as a whole.
I know that when I
came to IC (a long time
ago), I had an idea of
what the Union would be
like. Of course, it would
run a large number of
clubs and societies, and be
involved in "behind the
scenes" furthering student
interests; it would hold de-
bates on current affairs;
it would arrange dances
and discos. But above all,
it would provide a sense
of belonging to the Union.
Unfortunately, t h i s
doesn't often materialise,
and it's easy after a while
to accept the standard ex-
cuses that "we're a highly
technical, high workload
college", "we've go no arts
people", "we've got pre-
cious few girls". In one
word what we have got is
APATHY.
ICU has progressed tre-
mendously in the last three
years over specific issues
such as representation on
college committees, or
broadening of purely tech-
nical courses, but perhaps
the biggest step, to get a
more tangible community
spirit, is still to be made.
This in turn would foster
a greater involvement in
specific issues.
Well, what's so different
about ICU this year?
What's the catalyst needed
for this change?
Union Building
To get a Union that
everyone feels part of, you
need a Union building that
is "the place to go",
whether you want to watch
TV or meet people. We
have an excellent Union
building which has been
greatly underused these
last few years. Attempts
to reverse this have come
and gone but with the
wholesale redecoration and
refitting this summer, it's
the best chance yet.
On the ground floor
(which should be open by
the start of term) there's
the Union bar with fully-
equipped extension, the
lower lounge and the
Union refectory (open 10-
6). If we can get an Even-
ing Snack Bar going then
it's already an ideal social
centre. The Union Dining
Room and TV lounge are
on the first floor, while
the "Room at the Top" is
to be (when completed on
23rd October) a new in-
formation centre on tra-
vel, insurance, Union ser-
vices, student counselling,
etc. So if you want a pie,
a pint or a bumph sheet
. . . go to the Union!
Communications
This year, we've got a
weekly Felix for the first
time, an improved student
television service (S.T.O.
I.C.), and there's a pos-
sibility of starting up a
campus radio, as well as
the information centre,
so there should be no ex-
cuse for not knowing
what's on!
USK
Not new, but growing
all the time! There are
several colleges of vary-
ing sorts in the West Lon-
don area in USK, a good
many of them having a
large majority of girls, so
go along to their Union
. . . and invite them along
to ours!
So whether you're a
newcomer, or not, ask
yourself now what you ex-
pect ICU to be — then
ask yourself if it is. Better
still, bring your ideas to
the IC Union Office, Beit
Archway (Int. tel. 2488)
any time. And don't for-
get the Union meeting to-
morrow, Great Hall, 1.15
Get yourself
into shape
SUK
for your studies
with books and
stationery from the
I.C. BOOKSHOP
This will be the second
Rag Week this year, as
the 72-73 Rag Week will
be in November. Because
of the early date, the rag
organisation must start
early. The first meeting
of the term will be held
on Tuesday, 3rd October
at 7.30 p.m. in Committee
Room A (just off the
Lower Lounge in the
Union Building) and, of
course, anyone is welcome
to attend.
RAG
Our ideas for stunts in-
clude dressing up as
pigeons and going to feed
the tourists in Trafalgar
Square, and the tradi-
tional ones such as the
tiddlywinks race down
Oxford Street will take
place. There will also
be, as usual, a procession
and raffles. Some of these
events are well on the way
towards being organised—
others need help. We also
need someone who can
spell to help the chairman
(hear, hear—Ed.).
NEEDS
We would particularly
like your help with the
organisation of discos and
gigs, the rag mag, and a
dikshunnairy for the chair-
man (he's done it again!—
Ed.). We need people with
ideas, however insane
they might be (like trying
to break into the Bank of
England vaults with a 12
foot (3.78 metres) can
opener?).
Y
O
U
R
Even if you have no
ideas and are not inter-
ested in ragmags or ents.
we can still find something
for you to do. So if you
are interested in doing
something (or have just
got nothing to do?) this
Tuesday or any other
Tuesday, please do come
along to the Rag meeting.
They're very informal
(leave your clothes at
home) and great fun for
all is promised. You
shouldn't be able to miss
the signs to the meeting
. . . if you have, why not
draw some new ones for
us? Hope to see you there.
SUPPORT
Associated
Studies
"Associated Studies" may sound pretty
boring to you, and indeed totally revolting to
those of you who are Electrical Engineers, but
it is the title given to some surprisingly in-
interesting lunchtime lectures being given dur-
ing thefirsttwo terms of the year by various
distinguished people on a wide variety of
topics (most of which, I am glad to say, have
nothing whatever to do with science or tech-
nology).
These lectures have, in
fact, been a long-standing
feature of Tuesday and
Thursday lunchtimes in
Imperial College. They
are the reason why you
have a two-hour lunch
break on those days and
not on others. So why not
make the recommended
use of them and go to
some of these:
"The Environment" is
the title of a series of
seven Tuesday lectures.
These look at different as-
pects of the environment,
and concern industry, eco-
nomics, pesticides, politics
and population. The cast
of lecturers includes pro-
fessors from a number of
universities, the Deputy
Chairman of Shell Chemi-
cals, and the well-known
M.P., Dick Taverne.
Other series of lectures
are on "The Symphony"
by Michael Hurd, a com-
poser, conductor and lec-
turer, who will talk about
many aspects of sympho-
nies, and "Architecture"
by several of the staff of
the Architectural Associa-
tion.
There are also several
interesting individual lec-
tures: these include an
analysis of the US elec-
tions this autumn by a US
e m b a s s y spokesman;
"Painting a Portrait", al-
ways a popular practical
demo-lecture; "The As-
sault on Freedom" by
Mary Whitehouse and
"Student Problems and
the Law" by Nick Gre-
gory, the Union's Solici-
tor.
Complete details of all
Associated Studies lectures
are included in the
"What's On" column of
"Felix" every Tuesday.
