Despite expired completion dates, i t seems that the
lower two f l o o r s of the Union won't be handed back u n t i l about 10 a . u . on holi-
day morning. You see, for those of you u n i n i t i a t e d , i n the wonders of ICU, the
b u i l d i n g has been undergoing i t s s e p t e n n i a l t i t i v a t i o n . . . . w a l l s have been paint-
ed i n i n s i p i d shades, f l o o r s have been sanded and p o l i s h e d , and woodwork has bean
varnished. According to schedule, the ground and f i r s t f l o o r s should have been
ready on Sept 23rd, and the upper f l o o r s on October 23rd.
S t i l l , r e t u r n i n g to brass tacks, or rather insipkLd
paintwork, w h i l s t examining the l a t t e r the Union Executive minus k members (I
thought there were only 6 of them anyway??? 9 E d . ) were astoundedto see the
broken remains of the o l d bar extnsion i n the lower lounge instead, of the gleamin,.
new bar as promised, GJhen t r y i n g to follow t h i s up, the answer of "Sorry mate,
i t ' s not i n my contract" was rather pacta prevalent. S t i l l , perhaps i f we a l l
hold our breath for a week or so, we should get the bar and juke box and p i n -
tables back!

The I m p e r i a l College Bar Committee have, at vast
expense, obtained the s e r v i c e s of the Rector as barman at the new Junion Qmmon
Room Bar Inauguration on Monday (2nd) at 12.30. The r e c t o r w i l l p u l l the f i r s t

Contrary to your expectations from what you w i l l
hear from veterates of I m p e r i a l College and what you have j u s t read from the
two paragraphs abovey IC does not s o l e l y revolve around the bars. Unconfirmed
reports from a u s u a l l y r e l i a b l e source suggests t h t as uian, as four thousand
students here w i l l be attending l e c t u r e s and other academic events i n the comin
week. Should t h i s thaumaturgic tittle— tati&e be confirmed, there could be far
reaching consequences on IC students, such as the p o s s i b i l i t y of some of them
passing t h e i r examinations at the end of the year,
ed on further developments i n t h i s f i e l d .
