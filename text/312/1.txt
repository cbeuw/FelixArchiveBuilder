Those of you returning to face the rigours
of yet another year at IC may be surprised to
find Ian Mackenzie, last year's Academic
Affairs officer and long-suffering Council
member as ACTING president, instead of
the King of hip-swivelling himself, Chris
Sheppard.
For old hands, and
newcomers, FELIX
now reveals the full
story behind this
amazing reversal.
Back in March,
near the end of the
Spring term, a sudden
deluge of bumph-
sheets heralded the
most hotly contested
election times in re-
cent history (yawn).
One of the aspiring
presidential candid-
ates was Chris Shep-
pard from Civ. Eng.
2 proposed by—yes,
you've guessed it—
Ian Mackenzie. The
conclusion of the
campaign saw Chris
Sheppard e l e c t e d
President by a very
substantial majority,
along with Martin C.
Black Esq., secretary
(also a sabbatical
post) and Paul Jowitt,
deputy president. So
far so good.
Then, at the begin-
ning of the Summer
term, Mr. Sheppard
shook the world (or
at least the Union
Office) by announcing
that he was with-
drawing from his
exams. He asked an
IC Union meeting to
pass a motion letting
him still take up office
as President. His mo-
tion was defeated, as
ICU policy is that
any sabbatical officer
should either be qual-
ified to proceed to the
next year of his/her
course, or have just
completed a degree.
So Chris Sheppard
resigned and left a
'hole' of gargantuan
proportions at the top
of ICU's superstruc-
ture.
The first course of
action, i.e. a new elec-
tion, was ruled out as
the exam season was
almost there, so
Council decided in
favour of electing an
Acting President, as
allowed for in the
constitution, the
lucky person being—
shh, you know who,
Ian Mackenzie.
The post of Acting
President runs from
August 1st to Nov-
ember 1st, when a
new President will
have been elected. So,
folks, its election

unique position —

So it's more elec-

sheets, more Union
Meetings. Yippee . . .

FELIX is proud to be a founder member of the
London Student Press Association. This is a new
association formed by leading London student
newspapers designed to promote co-operation
between papers and their staffs and to help us all
produce better newspapers. Ways in which the
Association is already fulfilling this aim include
the holding of joint press conferences, the syndi-
cation of articles, features, etc., of common in-
terest, and issuing a common press card to help
member newspapers' reporters gain access to top
stories.
Other newspapers who have already joined the
LSPA and with whom we are working include
"Pi" (University College), "Cub" (Queen Mary
College), "King's News" (King's College), "WC"
(Westfield College), "Inner Circular" (Bedford),
"Reflex" (Birkbeck) and "Pepys" (North London
Poly), and most other London student newspapers
have expressed interest in joining. "Sennet", the
newspaper for the whole of the University of
London, with a circulation of 15,000, is a special
case; this, for the first time, is being compiled and
produced by the LSPA itself at its weekly
meetings.
You may be sure that "Felix" will take full
advantage of its membership of the LSPA, and
you will be able to read the LSPA interviews
(we have some really exciting interviewees) and
hear other colleges' viewpoints on news items
concerning I.C.
The LSPA always welcomes individual mem-
bers . . . people interested in the student press
and prepared to write, take photographs or
generally help are like gold dust, and are treated
as such. But if you become a member of the
FELIX staff you will automatically become a
member of the LSPA completely free of charge
to you, and all the benefits of LSPA membership
will be yours. See page 5 for details of joining
FELIX . . . we'd love to have ypu!
