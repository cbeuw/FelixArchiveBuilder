THE ACCOMMODATION PROBLEM
At the beginning of
last session the Union
took over the tenancy of
eight self-contained flats
in Hamlet Gardens, Rav-
enscourt Park. This pro-
ject has since met with
somewhat mixed success.
It was extremely success-
ful in that it provided
term-time accommoda-
for 58 students at moder-
ate rents, however, empty
rooms during the vaca-
tion and general mis-
management produced a
deficit of the order of
£1,600 at the end of the
year.
This figure comprised
the £1,000 surplus bud-
geted for, together with a
£600 loss on electricity—
hence, it can be seen that
the rent money received
just covered the cost of
the lease. In fairness to
the original controllers of
the project, it should be
emphasised that the lease
was acquired only two
weeks before the start of
the Autumn term—some
of the previous residents
not vacating the premises
until the first day of
term — leaving very
little time for any real
consideration of the prob-
lems likely to arise. As a
direct result of this, two
major problems arose.
One was the question of
maintenance. Nobody at
College seemed to be fam-
iliar with the terms of the
lease as far as internal
repairs were concerned,
with the result that some
The

Gardens
Story
items were eventually
passed on to the land-
lords, London Property
Services, who sometimes
attended to them — to
their own standards!
Other complaints were
lost in the depths of the
Union Office, indeed, ex-
aminations of the files re-
veals that a shower first
reported in October was
still defective in April,
after no fewer than four
separate written requests
for. action. The second
problem was the reverse
of the first in that it did
not affect the residents of
the flats, but the College
who were responsible for
collecting rent and paying
the fuel bills. This bungle
was not uncovered until
March when the College
received gas and electri-
city, via London Propetry
Services — nobody had
bothered to inform the
respective Boards that
Imperial College now
held the lease. No gas
bill had been expected as
all flats were thought to
contain pre-payment met-
ers emptied by the Board
direct, however, three
flats had quarterly non-
slot meters, hence the
bills. Each room in the
flats was fitted with a pre-
payment electricity meter,
some of which had locks,
and some of which
worked. These were emp-
tied periodically by Lewis
and Lewis Ltd., the land-
lord's agents, who invaded
all the rooms they could
with their master keys —
College failed to propose
any alternative means of
collection. Not surprising-
ly the total monies re-
covered from the meters
failed to meet the bill —
the difference being some
£600. It should also be
mentioned that no pre-
payment meters controlled
the power supplying the
corridor in each flat, nor
the immersion heaters in
some. This latter deficit
was followed by an un-
savoury attempt to recoup
the loss by billing each
flat's residents equally for
a sum based only on the
overall deficit for that
flat, with no account
whatsoever being taken of
money paid into indivi-
dual room meters. I am
pleased to report that the
threat of legal action
against the students con-
cerned has now been
withdrawn.
At the time of writing
the question of the lease
for the 72/73 session has
not been resolved. The
landlords asked for an in-
crease of 20% on the
price of the lease, but
careful negotiating on the
part of the Domestic
Bursar, Mr. Seaford, has
effectively imposed a
10% ceiling on any rise.
Indeed, the Union has
even offered to take an
additional property to
ease the Landlords' losses
due to vacant premises;
the latter were, of course,
to have been offered to
the Union, but at a rather
higher price than it looks
as though we shall now
have to pay.
In case you had not not-
iced, the cost of accommo-
dation is going up at any-
thing but an idle rate. The
USK lodgings bureau, run
in the Union Office, is
finding it quite difficult to
place students at prices
they can afford. There are
many reasons for this,
though perhaps the main
reason was put in the Sun-
day Times Colour Supple-
ment during the vacation
which said that an older
person is to be found
nowadays sharing a flat.
These people can afford
to pay more than £6 a
week which is the maxi-
mum most students can
afford to pay, and so stud-
ents find it more difficult
to find accommodation.
The increase in flat prices
is not in isolation from
other rises in prices of
transport and food. The
fact is that the grant in-
creases is far behind the
parity with various price
indices that it is supposed
to be calculated from. A .
recent NUS publication
put the spending power of
the grant down by at least
10 per cent on its 1962
level. What can be done
to change this situation?
In January NUS asked
the DES for an interim
grant increase. No, was
the answer. In June the
University Vice-Chancell-
ors got a similar reply. All
this was from an organisa-
tion headed by Van Strau-
benzee who, when in oppo-
sition, had uttered that
students grants were an
Making

item of expenditure that
the country could not af-
ford to shirk! Of course,
as was said at ULU last
November, if he asks the
Exchequer for more mon-
ey for education he may
be laughed at and down
would go his estimation in
the eyes of his toady Tory
colleagues.
If he is afraid of his
standing in his own party
the views of his colleagues
must be made favourable
to the cause of a grants
increase. A letter to your
MP outlining your finan-
cial difficulties will bring
the problem to his atten-
tion. Even better, go and
see him at the House of
Commons—you may even
get free tea! There are
many ideas floating about
on how more money can
be made available for stu-
ents at University—one of
them is loans. Make sure
you have your answers
ready to counter this sug-
gestion.
Last year much Union
time was spent on discuss-
ing the freedom of Student
Unions. This, though im-
portant, was magnified out
of all proportion as it was
in reality a battle of bur-
eaucracies. This year the
battle is going to be over
the financing of the indi-
vidual student and his
right to choose where and
what he studies. There
should be no incentives to
make a student live at
home in order to make
ends meet and people who
want to study art or drama
should get the same finan-
cing as students in science
as both are equally impor-
tant to society. Most im-
portant however is that
the student grant should
be brought up to a level
where he can get good ac-
commodation with study
facilities, good food and
finally money so that he
has an opportunity to de-
velop interests, broaden
his interests and meet
people.
Contact your MP and
ask him how to exist on
£480 for 31 weeks in Lon-
don and 21 weeks in some
other part of the country.
Perhaps if you gave him
a Mooney . . .
