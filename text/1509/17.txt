S
ustainability is a hot topic.
Yet despite all the recent
conventions and talks on
sustainability, it’s still
hard to know what living
sustainably really means.
So this year I am conducting my
own sustainability experiment. I am
calling it ‘12 Sustainable Months of
2012’, and my mission is to find out
how sustainable living can realistical-
ly be achieved. Every month of 2012 I
will be trying a different (supposedly)
sustainable lifestyle habit. E.g. I’ll be
trying one month of ‘no plastic bags’,
one month of ‘zero waste’, one month
of ‘sustainable travel’… you get the
idea.
This January, I decided to become
a weekday vegetarian. This means
not eating any meat on weekdays.
The idea is that, for those who shud-
der at the thought of becoming an ac-
tual vegetarian, and find the thought
of saying “this is my last ever KFC”
incomprehensible, this is a more sus-
tainable yet less brutal alternative.
(See Graham Hill’s TED talk “Why
I’m a weekday vegetarian”.)
On the scale of “I only eat plants”
to “I eat a steak for breakfast”, I fall
somewhere in the middle. I thought
that becoming a vegetarian for just
five days a week for one month would
be super easy. However, it has not all
been plain sailing.
I have found that there are two rea-
sons why being vegetarian is not as
easy as expected: 1. Vegetarian op-
tions are pretty limited. 2. Meat tastes
way better than vegetarian foods.
The first is, I think, the main diffi-
culty. There is a severe lack of veg-
etarian food available. For starters, the

library café provides just two different
vegetarian baguettes, both of which
are cheese, both of which sell out by
about 1pm. Poor form. In addition to
this, whilst attending college events
throughout January, I have turned
down free chicken kebabs, smoked
salmon sandwiches and sushi in fa-
vour of egg and cheese sandwiches,
which is just not cool. This is not to
mention experiences outside of col-
lege, including going to Nando’s and
not ordering chicken, and saying no
to bacon sandwiches cooked by my
housemate one morning. All in all, it
is pretty inconvenient to be vegetar-
ian.
Lack of choice aside, the other main
issue is that vegetarian options just
don’t taste as good as the meat op-
tions. Is there really a meat eater out
there who would choose a cheddar
and tomato baguette over a chicken
and bacon one (especially when they
are exactly the same price)? I highly
doubt it. On asking one of the biggest
meat lovers I know, Eugene Wong,
about how he’d feel about giving up
meat for five days a week, he said:
“Which sane individual would inflict
that sort of grave injustice on a fellow
human being?” Need I say more?
The main point to consider in this
discussion, however, is this: if every-
one stopped eating meat, would it ac-
tually make a significant difference?
Based on a moderately active person
with a weight of 65kg who consumes
about 2600 calories per day, it is esti-
mated that a vegetarian has a footprint
of 5.5kWh per day and a carnivore has
a footprint of 12kWh per day. This
means vegetarians have less than half
the footprint of carnivores. Although a
number of other factors would need to
be considered, such as where the ani-
mals live, what they eat and so on; the
point is that with over 7 billion people
on the planet, the energy saved if ev-
eryone were to become a vegetarian
would be significant.
So, there is a real case for eating less
meat. But is there a real solution? If
a ‘moderate meat eater’ like myself
found it fairly challenging to give up
meat five days out of seven for one
month, where does that leave the real
meat lovers of this world? Sadly, I am
not sure that global abstinence from
meat is really a realistic solution. But
is there another option?
This weekend, The Guardian pub-
lished an article entitled “Could lab-
grown meat soon be the solution to

the world’s food crisis?” The author
argues that not only could lab grown
meat reduce the environmental im-
pact associated with animal rearing,
it could be engineered to have less
fat and also prevent animal-borne
diseases. I am not convinced that eat-
ing meat grown in a lab is really that
appealing. However, if farming meat
for over 7 billion people is unsustain-
able, yet we are not ready to end our
love affair with meat, perhaps a more
radical solution such as this should be
seriously considered.

able Months of 2012” on: http://caro-

Awkward conversations
N
ow I’m not really one
to feel self-conscious.
If we’re being brutally
honest here, I actually
quite like getting atten-
tion – a hangover from my Mum never
looking at how high I was going. Re-
cent experience, however, has taught
me that I have boundaries – lines that
should not, under any circumstances, be
crossed.
You often hear folk whinging these
days (folk never used to grumble in the
good ol’ days, you see) that London is
an anti-social place. Nobody speaks to
you on the tube, you can never catch
that attractive person’s eye and not
one person has EVER asked you what
you’re writing on your MacBook Pro in
Starbucks.
Why is it then that all the social bees
seem to congregate at public swimming
pools? Swimming is not a social sport.
You spend the majority of your time
burying your head under water as if
you’re frantically training for the Som-
erset under-23 county apple-bobbing
championships. This is not the kind of
pastime that you’d imagine would ap-
peal to the chatterboxes.
But it does. Oh, how it does. In nor-
mal life, someone’s willy flopping
around in the breeze would be cause
for looking away in embarrassment, or
perhaps letting out a little snigger. But
not in the public baths’changing rooms.
Such a sight is an open invitation for
chatting about the weather, or ask-
ing what you bought your mother for
Christmas. Why?! You wouldn’t speak
to me clothed – why speak to me with
such gusto now that the crown jewels
are available for viewing?!
And it doesn’t stop at the changing
room doors. Never has the expression
“do you come here often?” been so ut-
terly misused as during stilted chats in
the shallow end. The correct use of that
phrase should have it dripping in irony.
It is NOT correct when both parties are
dripping wet and literally dressed in
speedos.
Boys have it easy though. Several
times my other half has come home
from her swim to tell me that other
members of the fairer sex have quizzed
her on personal gardening techniques
and habits. How you squirm out of that
one I have no idea. Answers on a post-
card please.
This is one of those rare instances
when life would be so much better
if people weren’t quite so keen to be
friendly. When I become President of
the United World this will be my first
royal decree: no extraneous words in
swimming pools. That will be all.
