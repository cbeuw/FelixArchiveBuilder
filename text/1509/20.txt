who persist with the whole album,
however, one can feel the exuberant
buzz which Times New Viking have
created. With their DIY aesthetic and
barely any songs touching three min-
utes, the band channel true punk spirit
to make something which is up there
with No Age’s releases. Many will
be put off by the abrasive nature of
‘Rip It Off’ but I would implore you
to give this album a try because I have
found that it is not just another lo-fi
hipster bullshit offering; there is real
beauty beneath.
need more drugs” is so stripped down
that a chill crawled down my spine. Ob-
viously, the lo-fi production value will
not appeal to everyone’s tastes but there
is a certain urgency and visceral thrill
which comes with abandoning any pre-
tence of gloss. In fact, I will go so far
as to claim that the world has become
so auto-tuned that it is entirely refresh-
ing to find a beautiful bubble-gum cho-
rus beneath layers of heavy distortion
as in ‘Teen Drama’. In the garden of
modern pop there are so many daisies
dressed up as roses that to actually find
one fragrant and beautiful flower which
manages to grow in a suffocating en-
vironment of feedback and screeching
guitars is such a wonderful experience.
Other highlights on the album include
‘Mean God’ and ‘Another Day’ which
are both listenable to by people who
cannot get into lo-fi. For those of you
Times New Viking’s third album Rip It
Off, their first to be released on Mata-
dor Records, became the darling of
the so called ‘shitgaze’ scene. Which-
ever Pitchfork employee exhausted
the synonym function on his computer
to come up with such labels as witch
house, chillwave and nu-gaze certainly
surpassed his or herself by dreaming
up the genre of shitgaze. It was a short
lived explosion of lo-fi guitar wailings
trying to overshadow its more sullen
older brother, shoegaze. At first it was
hard to comprehend such a proposition
as anything but a joke that I couldn’t
find the punchline for. Yet there have
been some promising bands to emerge,
namely the gut-wrenching fuzz of A
Place To Bury Strangers and the
dreamy distortion of Times New Vi-
king. Revisiting the latter’s best re-
lease, Rip It Off, and having discovered
how impressive it was, I refuse to let it
be forgotten in some scene which has
lost its hipster appeal.
The best song on the album is ‘My
Head’ with its anti-poetic, discordant
lyrics nestled in a bed of feedback. The
cry of “I need more money ‘cause I
The bubblegum border does it
for me.

Forgive me Father, for I have scened
I started this column last year but any
recent input has been massively lack-
ing. The feature started off highlighting
electronic music labels that were either
doing big things at that time or labels
that should just be known due to their
impact on music. I suppose this one
falls into both categories.
Occasionally, music labels become
synonymous with an individual scene
or genre, probably the most famous
example of this being Motown in the
1960’s. These days, with the almost
negligible price of production software
and the ease at which music can be
spread around the world, few labels ever
get chance to develop such a standing.
Stones Throw is a label which has done
just that. Heralding from Los Angeles,
with close links to Brainfeeder, Stones
Throw has become home to some of the
most creative and influential hip-hop
artists of the past decade. The label it-
self was set up by Peanut Butter Wolf,
a DJ and crate-digger from California,
whose love for vinyl is reflected by the
label’s policy of releasing music on big
slabs of black plastic (usually accompa-
nied by wonderful artwork).
J Rocc, Aloe Blacc and, recently,
Dâm Funk have all put out records on
the imprint, showing the increasing di-
versity championed by the label; instru-
mental hip-hop, soul and modern funk
all being covered. Yet it is the work of
the late J Dilla and the vast output of
Madlib in his many guises that really
defines the sound that Stones Throw is
famous for: beats so smooth and inven-

tive that the use of an MC is simply un-
necessary. That’s not to say you won’t
hear any rapping on Stones Throw’s
releases; take Madlib’s recent col-
laboration with Freddie Gibbs on the
wonderful Thuggin’ EP for example.
However, for me at least, it’s always
the instrumental work that really shines
through. It’s hard to exaggerate the in-
fluence this label has had and still does
have on so much of electronic music
today; James Blake’s most recent EP
samples a record put out by Stones
Throw in 2000 while Donuts and Mad-
villainy, by J Dilla and Madlib (in con-
juction with MF Doom) respectively,
are constantly cited as two of the best
hip-hop albums of the last decade.
And so normally at the end of this col-
umn I give some tips to get you started
exploring the labels I feature. This time
though I think it’d be fitting to tell y’all
to just come down to Scala this Sun-
day (5th Feb.) instead. A tribute night
to the incredible J Dilla is being held to
raise awareness and money for the fight
against Dilla’s killer: a blood disease
called Lupus. There simply won’t be a
better showcase of what Stones Throw
is all about.
With powerful guitar riffs, Oli
Clipsham surely knows how to
start up all of the songs from his
latest EP Because Even Crooks
Can Act. From beginning it gets
you hooked, and the catchy cho-
ruses sure seem to stay in your
head for a while.
The vocals are crisp and match
well with the full and expressive
metal-influenced guitar melody.
Overall they do a great job in-
tegrating all of the instruments
to make an impressive set of
songs; these guys will make a
breakthrough.

Slick licks of the ivories set
tones previously unthought of
to classics such as Eminem’s
‘Lose Yourself’, while Whiz Khal-
ifa’s ‘Black & Yellow’ turns into
the nostalgic recollection of a
school dance heart -break be-
hind the bleachers.
An improbable rendition of Lil
Jon’s ‘Get Crunk’ sweeps with
a swagger typically reserved for
hazy Monday nights in smoky
lounges. Sure to pop the hips of
even the most seasoned of ball-
room champions and give the
shyest wallflowers a hydroponic
kick in the backside.

Because Even Crooks Can Act
“I need more money
‘cause I need more
drugs.”
Stewiwonda’s debut is a discon-
certingly sweet concoction for
the poison it provides. Blending
futuristic hip-hop with hazy witch
house undertones and cramping
them in a blender with violent
electro stabs, he covers clas-
sics by staples as diverse as
James Brown, Spice Girls and
the Beatles.
This EP holds moments so
delirious they are usually only
found huffing old glue from a
dirty sock. Doctor says copious
amounts of chronic may be nec-
essary to cope through interpre-
tations such as these.
