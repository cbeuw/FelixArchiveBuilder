Captains’ Interviews:
Handball
Ladies and Gentlemen, I hope you’re
having a good Friday afternoon (I
won’t, I have lectures till 6). Sport edi-
tor gripes aside, I am pleased to pres-
ent this week’s interviewees: the lovely
Annabelle Mayers, handball women’s
captain, and the dashing Stefan Bauer –
goalkeeper extraordinaire and a found-
ing member of the club. As we sit down
in 568 over a pint I get cracking staright
away: if he is a founding member, how
is he still here?
“The handball club was founded in
2007-08, in my first year. Having been
into handball since I was 10, I got in-
volved, and was on the committee that
year! I have been heavily involved in
the club ever since.” I turn to Anna-
belle, asking how she got into handball,
and expecting an answer similar to Ste-
fan’s. I’m in for a surprise: “it was actu-
ally an article written in Felix by Stefan
in my first year that made me want to
sign up for it!” She explains further:
“Stefan had done an article just before
christmas, and I thought that handball
sounded like a cool thing to try out...a
year later, and here I am.” I can’t help
but smile at this: as Sport editor, this is
the kind of story that makes it all worth-
while.
I ask Stefan how he has seen the club
evolve since its inception. He knows
its history on his fingertips. “In the
first couple of years, we played mainly
friendlies with a mixed team, and had
a men’s team compete in the universi-
ties tournament organised by England
Handball (EH). The following year we
joined up with a First Division team,
Ruislip. We have an arrangement with
them to share facilities, training ses-
sions and coaches. At the moment,
three of our members play with them in
the top flight of english handball. The
women’s team was set up last year, and
this year they play in the EH develop-
ment league, as do the men.” But this
means that Annabelle is the first ever
women’s captain? “That’s right!” she
rbeams. “First captain ever.” There it is,
people, a piece of history in the mak-
ing: the first ever interview with the first
ever women’s handball captain. How
has their season been so far? “ We’ve
actually won two matches so far, which
is pretty decent for a nascent team...
We notably beat Oxford by 5 goals this
year, having lost to them quite heavily
last year, so that’s a notable improve-
ment”.
What about the men’s teams? Stefan
takes the question. “There is always a
core of strong European and Scandi-
navian students, many doing one-year
masters, who make up most of our first
team, and who train and play with Ruis-
lip. The Eagles are currently top of the
EH first division, and the Imperial team
is third in the development league.”
Having people play for the top team in
the league is pretty impressive, I think.
How often do they train?
“There is one session at Ethos every
week”, continues Stefan, and we can
always train at Ruislip another three
times a week. Four times is a bit much,
though! I usually train about two to
three times a week.” Annabelle con-
curs, and says a bit more about the Im-
perial sessions: “ The guys and the girls
train together, we always end up with
a match and a drink afterwards at the
union, so there’s a very social side to
the club.
While we’re on the subject, I ask if
(despite the small size of the club) they
go on any tours or trips together. As a
matter of fact, there is a handball tradi-
tion: a tournament every year organised
by the french school Centrale Lyon. “It
involves most of the French unis, and
it’s held for a lot of different sports, not
just handball, every year” says Stefan.
“We got into it the club’s first year be-
cause a guy here had studied there pre-
viously, and had an amazing time. It’s
become a handball ritual, where every
march we will go down to Lyon by any
means possible to eat, drink and play
handball!”
What about results? Or is it just for
fun?
“We’ve acually done better every
year... Last year, the girls made the kno-
cout stages in our first year there – but
the guys didn’t” says Annabelle. “It was
pretty satisfying.
“It’s a big competition, amd the level
is prettty high, given that it’s in France”
Stefan counters. “This year, we’re send-
ing a full girl’s team and two men’s
teams, and hopefully the guys can make
the semis”.
With the Olympics just around the
corner a major event in the handballing
world, what do they think of the state
of handball in England at the moment?
Stefan smiles at the mention of the
Olympics: “ I’m actually volunteer-
ing for the handball event, I should be
helping out with some of the teams
this summer. I was supposed to assist
the German team, but in the end they
didn’t qualify! Handball is growing
here, though, and England Handball
is really pushing for the development
of the sport.” Annabelle agrees: “You
see it more and more in schools now,
whereas when I was in school the only
sport I remember doing seriously was
netball. The Olympics will help it too,
with a number of handball venues being
left as part of the legacy”
Stefan concludes by hoping that more
home-grown players will mean more
university participation. “As the club
grows, we can hopefully improve and
get the Imperial teams up into the first
division”. Good luck, guys!
