The South Kensington campus was
not hitting its target of £1bn profit
every week. Unfortunately this led
to it being cut. They took student
concerns into consideration. The
study concluded whatever the
people who conducted the study
wanted to conclude. A focus group
was even used. Completely fair, im-
partial, and definitely not leading,
questions were asked. These con-
sisted of deep, intense questioning
such as: “Would you like to be on an
even better campus?” It turned out,
when you ask this everyone replied
yes! Luckily, this was enough to jus-
tify moving to a different campus
and re-branding.
Imperial Training Academy for
Banking, Management and Con-
sulting, as it shall henceforth be
known, will be, fittingly, moving to
the City. Widespread anger about
the move has been appeased by el
Presidente as he said that all was
okay because everyone has been
given free iPads.
The change will also coincide with
broad changes across the board in
curriculum. The vocational side of
courses is to be largely expanded.
Labs will be carried out in groups
so students will always have an ex-
ample of a “time they worked in a
group”. To add to that, students will
be forced to do spreadsheets for 16
hours straight while full of cocaine
and coffee; this change will simu-
late investment banking accurately.
The content of lectures will also be
cut and some courses will be en-
tirely removed. Lecturers will be no-
tified by e-mail.
It’s not all looking like bad news,
there will be lectures in consulting,
ensuring students “actually know
what the fuck consulting really
means”.
In other news, The Dinner Lady’s
house was a bit shit and needed im-
provement. The dining room need-
ed to be made much better. She
decided, wisely, that the best way
to do this was to buy a new house.
None were available, so she just
found the owners of a nice house
and is trying to kick them out. The
Dinner Lady is going to try to raise
funds by having a large, clear-out
sale. She’ll be selling the 1000 club
sandwiches that are left over in the
library cafe as nobody eats them.

In what can only be described as
an elated moment for Imperial Stu-
dent society, Onion Deputy Presi-
dent (Education) Jason Parmar has
officially resigned from office after
weeks of suspicion and doubt. Mr
Parmar publicly announced the
fairly uncontroversial news via his
Facebook account on the evening
of the 28th January.
Mr Parmar said that he is “Re-
signing as dpe- sick and tired of
bureaucracy and red tape....noth-
ing ever gets done around here and
it’s sickening the amount of money
wasted/ embezzled by the sup-
posed figureheads of our student
body. I just want Britain to be back
British!!!!” [sic].
Insider sources believe that this
was an inevitable outcome after Mr
Parmar was seen at a local Orange
store speaking with the store’s man-
ager. Upon his resignation, Mr Par-
mar was seen to be working at the
aforementioned phone shop as an
Orange Nokia sales representative.
After speaking with the Onion
Presidente, Scott Heath, about how
this would affect his plans for the
rest of the year, Heath said “I think
we can now safely guarantee stu-
dents the best possible mobile con-
tract, in what is sure to be a bright
future..”
When Hangman contacted the of-
fice of the only other Orange rep-
resentative associated with the Col-
lege, The Dinner Lady, we received
no response.
It is unknown whether the actions
of Mr Parmar will spark any kind of
reaction from the student body as
of yet. However militant groups of
postgraduates have begun to form
in the dark recesses of the College.
One group of Civil Engineering
PhD students posted a video on
YouTube, demanding that “until
the bureaucracy and red tape at
the Onion is eradicated... (they)
will do no work.”
The Iron Lady (who has no affili-
ations with the faculty of Engineer-
ing) offered an official viewpoint
on the situation. Claiming that “PhD
students do nothing but drink cof-
fee in the Senior Common Room.”
In his reaction to the alleged
claims, Sweet Potatoes has
decreed an official inves-
tigation into the On-
ion’s finances with
any findings to
be reported only
to him, claiming
this is an “in-
ternal affair, lol
PAR”.
We’re back! After years of watching
our illegitimate children run amok
with what was once the glorious
satire section of an obscure student
newspaper, the Hangman team of
old have come back with a hostile
acquisition. Sure we whacked a guy,
sure we set a cat on fire, but isn’t it
worth it? That was rhetorical, be-
cause the obvious answer is yes! In
fact we’re back as Hangman 2.0. Like
web 2.0 but with real dick sauce.
We know what some of you are
thinking. Who the fuck are you? What
happened to the old guys? Why is my
penis so small? Will clipping my pu-
bic hair make it look bigger? All valid
questions, however if you’re one of
the 99% who asked any of the above,
then unfortunately you’re already a
lost cause.
More importantly we’d like to tell
you “the situation.” It’s like this, we’ll
bring you so much satire, lolgasms
and unnecessarily misogynistic
jokes that you’ll either cry or have a
pleasant night of autoerotic asphyxi-
ation, unless the bitches complain.
Let’s be honest though, it’s not as if
they’re going to read this section, or
be able to read at all. Relax, we’re
joking. We love women… Daily. If you
seriously believe women are inca-
pable of reading then seek medical
advice immediately. Besides, women
are lucky to have you there to protect
them. It’s not like they could stick up
for themselves or even take a joke.
They could never engage in, obvi-
ously light-hearted, ‘banter’ as fuck-
wits refuse to not call it.
If you’re still with us, then be sure
to cut out the glossary on the next
page. This handy list will help you
keep up with the “actors” we pay ri-
diculously high salaries to run the col-
lege. A bit like the ones in Parliament
who are making some BBC show
with terrible speeches. Someone told
me they weren’t actors but are in real-
ity real people doing real jobs to pay
for their second home in France. That
can’t be true.
Anyway, last week we wrote some-
thing too shocking and had to hastily
redo the page. Our announcement
was ------- did a ----- on ------ with a
-------- and -------- Maggie Dallman
------eed ------ with a parsnip ------
destroyed department ---------- end-
ed in an excellent rectal exam.
To help understand the reason for
skipping the important step of asking
students what they think. The College
has released a subject specific anal-
ogy guide:
Maths: It’s like when you know the
start and end of a proof but not a step
in the middle. Just write it down as if
it’s obvious and put Q.E.D at the end.
Physics: When you’re results are not
a straight line. Just tweak them a bit.
Chemistry: When your product is a
low yield and you add some salt.
Materials: What the fuck do you
guys even actually do?
