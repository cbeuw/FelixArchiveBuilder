Whilst many students were having a lie-in
on Saturday 21 January, the 16 students
selected to participate in the 2012 Impe-
rial Apprentice Challenge arrived at the
Business School, complete with suits,
laptops, and determination, ready to con-
quer the challenges organised by the Im-
perial Entrepreneurs society.
The four teams, Zeus, Ipsum, Collater-
al, and Tornado, battled for the privilege
of representing Imperial in the London
University Apprentice Challenge against
LSE, Kings, UCL and Royal Holloway.
In addition to entry into the London com-
petition, the winning team received cash
and prizes from sponsors Proctor and
Gamble. The weekend consisted of four
challenges based on Strategy, Marketing,
Sales, and Product Development, fol-
lowed by a live final. The judging panel
consisted of guests from Ernst andYoung,
E-Synergy and the Imperial College Busi-
ness School. Adding to the pressure was
the fact the team members’ every move
was captured on film and selected scenes
included in a film showing highlights of
the event (search for ‘ImperialApprentice
Challenge 2012’on YouTube).
The first task, the Strategy challenge,
required the teams to “Create value from
nothing.” First, they had to obtain an item
for free, then proceed to trade the item up
until they obtained items of higher value.
The value created in just two hours was
astounding. The winners of this demand-
ing but fun task were Collateral (Andre,
Alex, Max and Hari) who secured a gift
bag containing a £110 chauffeur driven
cooperate car voucher, an expensive bot-
tle of wine and various other treats from
a hotel. The total value was estimated to
be over £160!
The second challenge, the Marketing
Challenge, provided participants with the
opportunity to rest their legs. Each team
were assigned one of four companies –
Snog frozen yoghurts, Gatorade energy
drinks, Talk mobile and Vitaminwater
– and had to decide upon a second com-
pany which they propose could carry our
joint marketing. They had to plan a three
minute elevator pitch, as if representing
the first company and persuading the
second to come on board, to be presented
to the judges in the live final. The teams
had to identify the target market, specify
how they intend to advertise and justify
why it would be mutually beneficial to
both companies. This joint marketing ap-
proach has proven popular recently with,
for example, companies such as McDon-
alds and Weight Watchers forming a mar-
keting partnership; McDonalds benefit
from an improved reputation regarding
the nutritional quality of their food and
Weight Watchers reaches a target au-
dience far larger than it could achieve
alone.Asecond example: the cooperation
between Spotify and Lucozade.All teams
were innovative in their approach to this
task and pitched their ideas successfully
to the judging panel. Following the pitch-
Greece broke the rule every year, but in-
terestingly neither Spain nor Ireland nor
Italy ever broke the 3% rule. Once again
it was left to the ethereal “market con-
fidence” to decide where the safe debt
was. The markets saw Germany as the
good guy, with Spain and Italy unfairly
portrayed as the villains.
Looking at the 10 year period between
2000-10, it is actually Germany whose
government debt rose the most (almost
25%), whereas Spain and Italy remained
pretty flat. In the case of Spain and Ire-
land, the problem wasn’t the govern-
ments; it was the private sector: busi-
nesses and individuals. The Spanish and
Irish private debt saw a huge increase.
And much of that money was invested
in buying German goods creating a debt
fuelled boom: Germany would give
away cheap credits to countries that
would spend the money in buying Ger-
man goods.
During these boom years, debt was
cheap and heavy borrowing led to an ac-
celerated growth rate. The Spanish and
Italians’ salaries increased significantly,
whilst Germans had a rather flat growth
in pay. That was fine while debt was still
cheap during the boom years; however,
as the economic downturn started, bor-
rowing rates rose sharply. Suddenly all
this debt was unaffordable to sustain.
Spanish and Italian goods became un-
competitive compared to German goods
as customers could no longer borrow to
afford inflated prices. This loss of com-

A not so happy birthday
O
n January 1, 2012, a ma-
jor economic milestone
was reached: the Euro’s
10th birthday. Although
the Euro had officially
been in existence since 1995 and was in-
troduced into financial markets in 1999,
it wasn’t until 2002 that notes and coins
were issued in circulation. The Euro is
an important currency; it is not only the
second largest reserve currency but it
is also the most circulated, with almost
€900bn in circulation. It is the currency
of 17 of the 27 European Union mem-
ber states, a population of more than
330 million, not forgetting the numer-
ous countries (mainlyAfrican) who have
currencies pegged against the Euro. This
totals to about 500 million people, 1/12
of the globe’s population, who directly
use this currency. It was all going so
well. Then the Global Economic crisis
happened, and in 2009, it had to battle
against the Sovereign Debt Crisis. To say
the last few years have been hard for the
Euro is a bit of an understatement. So,
what really went wrong?
It has been said that the sovereign debt
crisis was caused by excessive borrow-
ing by European governments. The Ger-
mans have been portrayed as the heroes
of the situation, doing their bit to help
their European brethren, and they seem
to be coping comparatively well. But are
they really that innocent?
As a part of the new agreement to try
and save the Euro, the German govern-
ment have insisted that a ceiling is put
in place limiting governments’ borrow-
ing to 0.5% of their output, aiming to
stop debt growing too quickly. But if
we turn the clocks back 15 years, there
was already a deficit ceiling, a 3% limit
that was put in the treaties that set up the
Euro, again insisted on by the Germans.
But it was Germany who broke this
3% rule first in 2003, and it has done it
for about half of the years of the Euro.
petitiveness was due to higher labour
costs making it much harder for these
countries to kick start exports. Low ex-
ports at a time where debt was expensive
lead to further economic slowdown. Un-
employment went up and the problems
just kept getting worse.
Spending cuts may make debts harder
to repay, but will not necessarily lead to
a rise in exports, and will probably re-
sult in further recession. But a continued
spending risks bankrupting the country,
resulting in spiralling shrinking of its
economy and in a loss in market confi-
dence. This is the dilemma that most Eu-
ropean governments now face.
During the onset of the crisis, govern-
ments had to increase their borrowing to
help support the collapsing private sec-
tor. When a government has to borrow,
it can devalue its own currency to help
ease the pain. Spain and Italy could not
devalue their currency though, as they
were tied up into the Euro. The high
levels of debt infected the whole single
currency where everyone was suddenly
being exposed to these high levels of
debt. This has not only crippled the Eu-
rozone countries’ economies, but has
dramatically reduced the prestige of
the Euroclub. As the European econo-
mies weakened, debt market confidence
dropped, and borrowing costs all over
the Eurozone increased.
But yet, after all of this, we are still
being told the Germans played the right
game. That is not entirely true. As one
can see, a lot of the problems we are ex-
periencing now are due to lending by the
Germans. It seems they have used the
single currency as a way to increase their
economic strength at the expense of the
smaller developing southern European
countries. The road ahead for the Euro-
club is definitely a tough one. It is clear
to almost everyone that for the Euro to
reach its 11th birthday it will need radi-
cal reform.

growth rate”
es, the judges scrutinized each team’s
efforts and presented them with thought
provoking questions.
Given a short while to recover from
Saturday’s challenges the teams met early
on Sunday morning to commence the sec-
ond day of the Imperial Apprentice Chal-
lenge. For the Sales Challenge the teams,
once again, had to muster up the energy to
run around the local area interacting with
strangers. Given £20, each team were
told to invest some or all of their money
in stock from local shops or supermar-
kets and sell their purchases in whichever
location they felt appropriate. The team
which made the largest profit would win.
Performance was impressive with the
most successful team, Tornado, creating
a net profit of £64 in just two hours. In
the Entrepreneurial spirit team Tornado
acquired copies of the Financial Times
(which are distributed for free in the busi-
ness school) and managed to sell many
copies by knocking at peoples doors and
selling to strangers in the street. Other
interesting approaches were seen: for ex-
ample, team Ipsum sold water to runners
in Hyde Park and Collateral made hot
chocolate in free cups from Pret a Manger
using a kettle borrowed from halls and
sold the warm drinks with cookies to cold
Londoners.
The final, most demanding task, at least
in terms of time management, was the
Product Development Challenge, which
saw each team design a new service or
product to be launched by either Play-
boy or Ferrari. The teams were required
to create a presentation outlining their
innovative idea, target market, market-
ing strategy, financial outlook and 5 year
projections. The outcome was to be pre-
sented to the audience and judging panel
in the live final. Due to the nature of the
companies some interesting ideas ap-
peared on the whiteboard! Ipsum boldly
pursued the idea of Playboy ‘adult toys’
whilst collateral opted for a luxurious and
professional Playboy spa. Team Tornado
saw great potential in exclusive Ferrari
Yachts whilst Zeus envisaged Luxury
Ferrari hotels.
The results of each team were an amal-
gamation of the outcome of the two ac-
tive tasks and the judge’s opinions of the
pitches and presentations. Team Tornado
triumphed, meaning the team members,
Effie Kyrtata, Ignacio Doval, Sabrina
Ghiddi, and Isobel Qian will represent
Imperial in the London Apprentice in
late February. The Judges from Ernst and
Young, E-Synergy and the Imperial Busi-
ness School commented on the impres-
sive ideas and high quality presentations
made by all teams. They noted that the
marking was not easy as the standard of
all teams was very high. Team Collateral
finished in a close second place followed
by Ipsum and then Zeus.
Here’s to another ten years...?
