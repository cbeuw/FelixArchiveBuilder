SLITHERLINK
The aim with Slitherlink is to
make one continuous closed
loop by connecting the dots. The
numbers in each square indicate
how many edges of the square
are part of the loop, so if it con-
tains a “2”, you know that two
and only two out of four edges
have lines. That’s all the info you
need to get the one logical answer
(though waiting a week to see the
solution will also do). Answers
to puzzles.felix@imperial.
ac.uk, as the puzzles team re-
cieves one per correct solution.

Word Wheel
Make as many words of at least
4 letters as you can, always using the
central one. NO plurals, conjugated
verbs, comparatives or superlatives,
because I said so.. There is always at
least one 9 letter word.
TARGET: 21
