FILM
Get ready for the craziest, most intense,
and unforgettable ride of this year. Yes,
Polanski’s latest Carnage is a force to
be reckoned with; which is odd, mostly
because of its incredibly modest run-
ning time (79 minutes), small cast (four
key characters), single set (a New York
apartment), and what appears to be a
straightforward plot. But based on the
Tony Award winning play God of Car-
nage by Yasmina Reza, this is a de-
ceptively simple film that has so much
energy and power to dish out, even in
its tiny scale. So get ready – for a hot-
tempered, scream-filled, foul-mouthed,
alcohol-fuelled, vomit-covered (yes,
really) experience that will be hard to
resist.
In a brief prologue set in contempo-
rary New York, we see an 11-year-old
Zachary pick up a stick and swing it in
Nathan’s face, which results in bruising,
swelling and two teeth being knocked
out. Zachary’s parents, Nancy (Winslet)
make up the cast pull out all the stops
and ferociously attack one another as
the meltdown occurs. Waltz is hilari-
ous as the smug, cavalier Alan, Wins-
let may seem proper and decent to start
with but as the atmosphere starts to spi-
ral out of control, she drunkenly chews
the scenery like never before. Foster is
on the offence from the start, and she
is the angriest, most intense one of the
four, which results in some dangerous
moments of melodramatic over-acting
coming from the actress, but she is
mostly on fine form. Reilly, with his
towering presence, filling up almost ev-
ery single shot of himself with his grand
stature, is incredible, as he handles both
extreme sides of his character perfectly,
making that transition without any fuss.
For a man nearing the age of 80, Po-
lanski doesn’t show signs of slowing
down. He keeps the tension running
high, and there is no way of knowing
for sure how this messy situation will
come to a close. Carnage is outrageous,
shocking, yet hysterically entertaining
with plenty of nasty, wicked wit. With
four unique performances from its un-
beatable cast, and under the assured
guidance of a veteran director, this is
may have “Oscar-bait” written all over
it but no bait in the past has been this
savagely funny.
The kids are all right,
the adults are not
and Alan (Waltz), are invited over by
Nathan’s parents, Penelope (Foster) and
Michael (Reilly), to discuss this situa-
tion in good faith. What was supposed
to be a civilised, calm meeting between
four mature people start taking darker
turns, as true characteristics and feel-
ings are revealed.
What makes this so agonising, yet
irresistibly tense, is the fact that this
encounter could have been over in min-
utes. Nancy and Alan could have left
Penelope and Michael’s flat so much
sooner. They get to as far as the eleva-
tor, twice, and yet every time, they end
up in the living room. The bitter hatred
and unfinished business make it diffi-
cult to call it a day. It’s almost perverse
and sometimes scary to think that these
people cannot and refuse to leave; and
no-one does claustrophobia better than
Polanski. Even though this may seem a
highly unambitious project for a direc-
tor who has made many classics over
his astonishing career, his attention to
detail is impeccable. He gets right up
close to his actors, and the apartment
in which most of the film is set seems
sizable enough, but Polanski chooses
to remain mainly in the living room,
crowding his scenes with his four stars.

aggressive statements are the reasons

Carnage why there can be no simple resolution.
Even from the very start, the victim’s
mother is defensive and secretly mad
as hell. She has a condescending tone,
something the perpetrator’s father is far
from willing to accept. Boys fight. It’s
a part of life, and he’s not prepared to
apologise so profusely. Trying to con-
trol her husband’s snarky outbursts is
the perpetrator’s mother, who tries to
show as much genuine-looking apolo-
getic expression as possible. But even
she has a breaking point. Acting as the
good-natured mediator is the victim’s
father, who tries to put on a smile when-
ever possible. But he too has issues of
his own, and as everyone mouths off,
he joins the fight and shows he also has
a louder side.
As the Scotch comes out, and with
the high alcohol dose kicking in, there’s
swearing, crying, yelling, hitting,
throwing things, and behaviour that is
unacceptable in any social scenarios
involving grown-ups. They gathered
to come up with a disciplinary plan of
action for their children. But it appears
the adults are no better than the children
themselves. The script is crisp enough
to keep a healthy pace and the heavy
dialogue-centred drama is extremely
dense yet to the point.
