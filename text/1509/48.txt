Touché: Fencers win Premiership(s)
IC confirm reigning champion status
at Ethos in weekend tournament
Indy Leclercq reports
T
he mantle of success is
never an easy thing to bear,
especially so in sport. Suc-
cess breeds expectation,
which translates into pres-
sure – exactly the sort of thing you don’t
want when you’re trying to reproduce
past exploits.
On the weekend of the 20th of January,
the Imperial men’s and women’s team
took all this in their stride while attempt-
ing to defend their Southern Premiership
crowns, and come top of the league for
the second year running.
The women were on a string of vic-
tories, as yet unbeaten this season. The
first premiership tournament weekend,
which saw all the home matches of the
season played in one go, ended with IC
ladies on top and raring for more.For
captain Charlotte Levin and her team,
it should have been plain sailing – and
for the most part, it was. Beginning the
weekend by fencing foil and sabre on
the saturday, the girls breezed through;
thoroughly destroying Queen Mary and
winning convincingly against Oxford,
Cambridge and UCL. The day ended
with the girls having assured victory in
one match (before having fenced the
epee) and needing an easily-achievable
amount of points to win the others.
Things were looking up, and it all almost
seemed too easy.
The men’s team, however, was hav-
ing a rather more trying time of it. Their
first match against Cambridge got off
to a good start, with a (somewhat ex-
pected) win in the sabre, putting the rest
of the team at ease. The foil continued
in this vein, beating their opponents by
more than ten hits (where they had lost
on the previous occasion). It fell to the
epeeists to finalise the victory, which
they did in style. Final score: 120-108.
A first win soothed the men’s nerves,
which was necessary for the match to
come: a showdown with the league lead-
ers Oxford. Having drawn, and lost on
weapons, to the Dark Blues at the pre-
vious premiership weekend, the guys
had a bone to pick with the Oxford
team. Unfortunately, the schedule meant
that Imperial had a long break between
matches, and this had them feeling quite
lethargic when the time came to take up
arms again.
The match got underway with sabre,
as before, and the sabreurs did not dis-
appoint, pulling off a resoundingg vic-
tory to leave Imperial twenty-nine points
clear. The foil was more of an uphill
struggle, with both good and bad perfor-
mances from the team. In the end, they
