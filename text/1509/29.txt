Imperial College Union Rep Week is only
ten days away (13-18 February) and it will
be your chance to find out all about what
representation has done for you!
During the week your reps will be
around your department and in the JCR
wearing their specially made rep T-shirts
to tell you about representation, answer
any questions you have and take any
recommendations or complaints you have
about your department.
So make sure you come down to
the stalls and ask us all about it, we’ll
have posters, flyers, free sweets and
suggestion boxes all to help improve
YOUR student experience.
What are reps?
There are hundreds of reps across
College – from first-year undergraduates
to writing-up PhDs. We want you to know
that there’s a rep just for you, who is
nearby, accessible and will successfully
represent you.

What is the rep system?
The rep system is an integral part of ICU,
just like clubs, societies, events and bars.
The rep system has been around for
decades and has brought in or protected
things that are important to you, like
Wednesday afternoons off or getting your
coursework back on time. The NSS now
has a question about students’ unions for
the first time, and we want to highlight
the numerous ways that ICU works for
students individually and collectively.
What is the National Student Survey
(NSS)?
We’ll be explaining what the NSS is
and why it’s so important to gather
your feedback. We’ll even have laptops
for you to complete it on (www.
thestudentsurvey.com).
NSS is very important, and works on lots
of scales – it helps us spot problems in
individual departments, but also plays
a part in national league tables and is
key to Imperial’s reputation as a top UK
university. Final-year students have a few
weeks to fill it in – take your only chance,
do it now, and have your say.
What is NoteBox?
Rep Week will see the announcement
of the Union’s latest project. A new, free
online store of the best notes your fellow
students have taken in class.
Keep your eyes peeled for the full launch
in a few months and check out www.
