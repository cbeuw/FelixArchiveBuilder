Want to act?
Imperial College Dramatic Society gives you the opportunity to act in, produce or direct
shows. Additionally we are very strong technically: look out for our lighting all over the Union
building over the course of Freshers' Week. We do at least two major plays a year as well as
smaller productions and acting workshops.
Want to join the crew?
We also run Theatre West End, a venue that we build for the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. This is
a venue we run throughout August which we sub-let to other groups and where our very own
Theatre West End Productions perform.
