Out With The Old, In With The New
BY ANDREW TSENG
Sir Ronald Oxburgh has begun his
term of office as Rector of Imperial
College following the retirement of
Sir Eric Ash.
The new Rector was appointed
on 17th July 1992 and is the first
Rector of Imperial College not to
have had any prior connection with
the college. Born on 2nd November
1934, Sir Oxburgh is married with
three children. He has distinguished
himself on both the academic and
administrative sides of science and
education, being a Geology
graduate from University College,
Oxford, and having been elected to
the Fellowship of the Royal Society
in 1978.
In 1978, Professor Oxborough
was awarded the Professorship of
Mineralogy and Petrology at
Cambridge University and went on
to become Head of the Department
of Earth Sciences in 1980. During
the 1980s, he became President of
Queens College, Cambridge, and
received a visiting Professorship of
Cornell University in 1986.
A major change in direction of
Professor Oxburgh's career took
place in 1988, when he was
appointed Chief Scientific Advisor
to the Ministry of Defence, a post
that he held until coming to
Imperial College.
Professor Sir Ronald Oxburgh
replaces Sir Eric Ash, who after
eight years as Rector, has seen the
college through thick and thin.
Sir Eric gained his PhD at
Imperial College in 1952 and went
on to do research at Stanford
University, California. Following
this, he spent nine years at Bell
Northern. Following his time there,
Sir Eric returned to the United
Kingdom as a lecturer and then
head of Electronic and Electrical
Engineering at University College,
London, until becoming Rector of
Imperial College in 1985.
In addition to Sir Ronald
Oxburgh's start of office, two of
the college's Constituent Colleges
have new Deans. The new Dean of
the City and Guilds College, former
college tutor, Professor Julia
Higgins, and the new Dean of the
Royal College of Science,
Professor John Pendry, began their
terms of office on 1st October.
