Waldegrave's Higgs Boson
BY ANDREW TSENG
Professor of Theoretical Physics,
Tom Kibble, is one of the winners
of the 'Higgs boson' competition.
Tom Kibble, is the 'forgotten half
of the two man team who proposed
the existence of the Higgs boson.
M r Waldegrave set the
competition at the Institute of
Physics Annual Congress in
Brighton last April (see Felix 964).
In a call for better understanding of
science, he told reporters that he
would give a bottle of vintage
champagne to anyone who could
tell him what the Higgs boson is,
and why they want to find it.
Entries had to be in layman's terms
and be submitted on a single side of
A4 paper.
After reading 117 entries, M r
Waldegrave selected five winners
with the help of Professor Michael
Berry of Bristol University, who
checked them for scientific
correctness.
Congratulating the winners, Mr
Waldegrave said, "I was delighted
with all the entries to the Higgs
boson competition. They were of
such high quality that we have
chosen five winners instead of just
one. M y congratulations to all of
them, even if it has cost me five
bottles of champagne instead of
one!"
Of the five winning entries, two
Tom Kibble, one of the winners of the Higgs boson competition
were associated with Imperial:
those of Professor Kibble and the
joint entry of Mary and Ian
Butterworth, of Imperial College
with Doris and Vigdor Teplitz of
the Southern Methodist College.
The other winners were,
Professor Roger Cashmore,
University of Oxford, Simon
Hands, European Organisation for
Nuclear Research (CERN) and Dr
David Miller of University College
London.
Copies of the winning entries
are available from the Felix office.
Guy's and Thomas's Hospitals
Devastation
BY ANDREW TSENG
Staff at Guy's and St Thomas's
hospitals have been left reeling this
week after it was announced that
2000 jobs are to be axed. 800 beds
could also be lost, casualties of
recent NHS reforms introduced by
the Health Secretary, Virginia
Bottomley.
The changes in the NHS have
introduced an internal ' N H S
marketplace'. This has caused
many health authorities to
withdraw their funding of some of
London's hospitals. The money has
instead gone to the cheaper
suburban hospitals.
As a result of this, Guy's and St
Thomas's hospitals face a Â£75
million loss over the next five
years. University College Hospital,
seen by many as one of the
Capital's strongest hospitals, both
financially and academically, has
been similarly threatened.
In response to the need for
drastic cuts, the joint management
have released a document
describing proposals which will
seriously affect the two hospitals. It
details the need for spending to be
reduced by around 30 per cent. One
of the proposals is that the current
workforce of 7000 people must be
reduced to 2000 by 1998. This
would have the knock-on effect of
the loss of around 800 beds and one
of the accident and emergency
units.
A decision must also be made as
to whether the hospitals should
remain on two sites or be combined
on a single site. This would remove
the physical separation of the two
hospitals that have now been
merged for several years.
Both Guy's and St Thomas's
hospitals are teaching hospitals for
Guy's Medical and Dental schools.
Although the cuts do not affect the
schools directly, there is little doubt
that any large scale cuts to the
hospitals will have a detrimental
effect on the medical schools. The
effect on the local community
could also be devastating since, of
the 600,000 patients at the two
hospitals over the last year, over
400,000 were from the local area.
In brief
Know Your Rights
The mystery of welfare benefits has
been unraveled by a program
developed by Professor Brian
Jarman, Head of the Department of
General Practice at St Mary's
Hospital Medical School.
The program entitled, 'The
Lisson Grove Welfare Benefits
Program' provides GPs throughout
the U K with detailed information
on welfare benefit entitlements.
Professor Jarman believes
patients suffer less from stress if
they have immediate access to, and
a clear understanding of, their
welfare rights.
Far East Contacts
A UK/Japan and Asia-Pacific
Advisory Group on Science and
Technology has been set up to
advise the British Government.
Through the Chancellor of the
Duchy of Lancaster, they are
recommending ways to foster
beneficial scientific and
technological relations with Japan
and other countries in the Far East.
Funding Changes
The Department for Education is
currently in consultation with
students on what has been termed
the 'Voluntary Membership White
Paper'.
Current proposals split student
union funding into core and non-
core areas. Core areas would be
able to be funded with public
money, whereas to do so with
non-core areas would be classed as
'ultra-vires'.
Controversy has arisen in the
interpretation of core and non-core
areas. Under the present proposals,
a rugby club could be funded by
public funds, whist the orchestra
could not. The consultation period
is set to be completed by the end of
October.
Prompt Payment
Students, universities and colleges
have a right to expect grants and
tuition fees to be paid promptly by
Local Education Authorities.
Education Secretary John Patten
said recently: "Students have a
right to a high quality service - and
we must work to see that they get
it. I look forward to your co-
operation in bringing this about."
