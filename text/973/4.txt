Imperial's School Constituent College
Science Project Unions in Turmoil
Baroness Blatch has launched a
new School Technology Project
which aims to provide high quality
education for secondary school
pupils in technology.
The project is to run for three
years and is a joint initiative
between the Royal College of Art,
Imperial College and the City
Technology Colleges Trust.
There are six specific aims to
the project. These are: to develop
design and technology in 15 to 20
schools and colleges in the 11-19
age range; to work with business
and industry; to draw together
vocational developments for the

Oxford University, concerned by
recent suicides, has decided to take
action by improving the guidance
and welfare services it gives to
freshers.
University-wide advice on the
tutorial system will be introduced at
Oxford University for the next
academic year, As a precursor to
this, freshers are being given advice
on study skills, as well as the
introductory tours of the city and
the university.
Relieving some of the pressure,
on students is something that
14-19 age range; to demonstrate
ways to integrate technology with
science and mathematics; to
produce a comprehensive course in
design and technology which will
be disseminated to schools
nationwide and to support the
course with appropriate assessment
and accreditations.
Speaking at the inaugural
reception, Baroness Blatch said, "In
many ways this country leads the
world in technology education. It is
vital that we maintain our lead. To
do so, we must achieve a higher
status for technology and science in
our schools and colleges."

Oxford University is also looking at
after their Committee for Student
Health found that, although
academic problems were not a key
factor, it was recommended that
steps were made to try to reduce the
pressure.
In a separate statement,
University Vice-Chancellors have
demanded more state funding for
students suffering financial
hardship. They also requested that
funds be extended to cover
part-time workers who could not
find vacation work.

The two largest Constituent
College Unions have begun the
new academic year in turmoil after
the loss of an executive committee
member from each of them. The
Royal College of Science has lost
its Honorary Secretary, whilst the
City and Guilds College no longer
has a Vice President.
On Monday 6th September,
Duncan Austen, also known as
'Badger' resigned from his elected
post of Honorary Secretary of the
Royal College of Science. Miss
Rhian Picton, President of the
Royal College of Science, in an
interview with Felix said that, "it
was a mutually acceptable decision.
He was asked, I didn't tell him. He
resigned because vital work hadn't
been done,". When asked for
further details, Miss Picton stated,
"I had given him prior warning that
I was not happy a month before he
made his decision,".

Sufferers of fish odour syndrome
have now been told that they
cannot do anything about their
personal freshness problem - it is
inherited. This follows a study by
researchers at St Mary's Hospital
Medical School which found that a
gene is the cause of fish odour
syndrome.
Fish odour syndrome is one of
the most common causes of bad
breath and odorous perspiration.
According to a recent report in the
British Medical Journal, sufferers
of the disease admit to suicidal
tendencies, social isolation,
paranoia, depression and feelings of
shame.
The group at St Mary's
investigated the conditions of
almost 200 people, after an
advertisement was placed in The
Independent for volunteers who
might have had a body odour
problem, to take part in the study.
The study found that 1 in 15 of
those people tested had fish odour
When asked whether the
resignation was demanded of M r
Austen, Miss Picton gave an
emphatic, "No". She did, however,
add that the lack of an Honorary
Secretary has not had a particularly
detrimental effect on the Royal
College of Science and that almost
all the tasks the Honorary Secretary
has to do had since been completed.
Duncan Austen was unavailable
for comment as Felix went to press.
The City and Guilds College
Union has lost its Vice President
due to academic affairs. The
elected Vice President, Joe
Baguley, failed to get through to
the third year of his course and has
hence been forced to leave the
college. Paul Griffith, President of
the City and Guilds College Union
is said to have everything under
control.
It is expected that the election
for a new Vice President will be
held shortly.
syndrome, or trimethylaminuria.
When questioned about the effect
the disease had on them, sufferers
recalled how the disease had
blighted their lives, broken up
relationships, wrecked promotions
and led many to alcohol and drugs.
The condition is caused by the
inability of the body to break down
the compound trimethylamine. This
is a by-product of food digestion
which smells strongly of fish.
Usually this compound is turned
into an odourless substance.
However, in the case of fish odour
syndrome sufferer, the gene that
controls this conversion is faulty.
The result of this is that the smelly
compound trimethylamine is
secreted in breath and perspiration.
This causes the fish odour.
On assessing whether the
condition was hereditary, the
researchers found that the condition
can be passed on if both the parents
have the faulty gene. However, if
this was the case, the parents would
not know that they carried it,
showing no symptoms themselves.
