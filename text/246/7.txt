learn. He jiust be curious. These
are the things I demand from a poten-
tial research student.
In educating potential engin-
eers, do you believe in giving
them as general an academic and
practical education as possible (at
the undergraduate levr.-.) ? Or do
you believe in early « 1
intensive
specialised study ?
One can overgeneralise education,
bearing in mind that a seventeen-
year-old in general doesn't know what
he wants tq do. I believe in the indli-
vidual : if a chap knows what he
wants to do it is tragic if the sharp
edge of his enthusiasm is blunted by
extra courses on topics which do not
interest him. My personal ambition is
to raise another Maxwell or Faraday,
not just a generation of good engin-
eers. My department subscribes in
the main to broad education. I have
been accused of lecturing only to po-
tential research students — perhaps
fairly, but it annoys me that a third
year specialist in my subject gets only
eleven lectures from me and forty-
four from L.S.E.
In America a large number of
engineering graduates go into
business and civil administration.
Is this a trend in Britain ?
Among the people who run
Britain's industries to-day, there are
still many who are self-made men.
Business management, for instance, is
often composed largely of men who
have risen from the shop floor. Un-
fortunately their minds are for the
most part not formally trained, and
they are handicapped by a lack of
respect for academic's. In a sense,
Britain is waiting for these men to
retire. Engineers should then fill
some of these managerial and admin-
istrative posts, but whether this is a
trend or not, I dont know. It should
be.
Do you think it is the job of
this college to produce engineers
and scientists—or technologists in
general—for industry, or people
who are more generally qualified
for management and the civil
service ?
First of all, let me say that engin-
eers and scientists are the same thing.
I feel quite strongly about this, for
many people in high places are stating
publicly that an engineer is not a
scientist.
Nationally speaking, the Germans
and the British are best at producing
new ideas, and these are what we
should try to export. To do it, we
must be good at engineering. Thus
the most important thing for this
country is to encourage the best
students to study applied science at
university. At the G.C.E. level, the
only sciences they know are physics,
maths and chemistry. And this is all
their teachers know. Thus if senior
peonle keep emphasising that engin-
eering is not science, the brighter
science students in schools will simply
not choose it as a career and the
country will suffer. I am sure that
too often the advice of a careers mas-
ter is : " If you are not good enough
to read physics, you can always do
engineering." They should explain
that there is engineering science and
pure science.
I try to attract good students from
the schools into applied science
through my membership of one of the
G.C.E. Examination Advisory Boards,
which advise on syllabus revision.
One of the main iobs of the college
is to encourage the best students we
have. If we don't, no one else will.
After that we can also hope to pro-
duce good people for industry includ-
ing management.
How would you feel about the
introduction of schools of busi-
ness administration and of the
social sciences into Imperial
College ?
This will be all right if the people
taking business administration are
doing it instead of, not as well as, en-
gineering. Our students are busy
enough as it is; they don't have
enough time to pursue their own in-
terests. That is partly inevitable be-
cause of the amount to be learned—
we can't teach them all they have to
know in three years. It all goes back
to the will to learn : oppose the stu-
dents' wishes and you'll make them,
dull boys. Tell them what's good for
them and they won't like it. I think
engineers should be given the option
of not doing general studies, for ex-
ample. Let the bright students spec-
ialise ; if a student has brains, he will
learn about things outside his own
field of specialisation anyway.
Do you conceive Imperial Col-
lege as expanding eventually into
a university with a full spectrum
of humanities ?
No. Other parts of the University
of London do this ; why should we ?
Besides we haven't enough space for
our existing facilities, let alone room
for expansion. 1 would like to see
I.C. become the M.I.T. of England
by concentrating on being best at
what we are already doing.
What is your principal problem
in organising research at the pre-
sent time ?
I think perhaps, getting enough
hands and brains to do the work. In
the last few years none of our new
graduates have stayed on for research.
It is hoped that after a period in in-
dustry they will return, but once a
man has worked in industry and got
married, he's not going to come back
to do postgraduate work at £800 a
year or so. As a result, we have not
enough people to try out all the idsas
we should like
It is relatively easy to get money
for research equipment but incredibly
difficult to get a man's salary and this
seems to be a very curious national
policy.

written this series of articles on
prominent academic figures in

of Carlton University, Ottawa,
where he worked on the stu-
dent newspaper. He is now a
postgraduate in physics.
