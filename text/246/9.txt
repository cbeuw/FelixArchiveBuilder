RUGBY CLUB
IN IRELAND
GUINNESS ALMOST VICTORIOUS
After a Gale Force 8 crossing it
was a rather weary party of Rugby
players that fell off the boat in Dub-
lin with nothing but a cold, rainy day
to greet them. At the Customs cer-
tain members of the group had to pay
import duty on their breath alone.
After a couple of hours sleep the
five healthiest members were dragged
out of bed by Fagins to play against
Guinness Brewery. The rest of the
team could only summon the strength
to locate the bar. While Rayner and
O'Reilly had been dragged out by
" Boo-Boo" Smith to locate Trinity
College to arrange Tuesday's game it
was at 6.30 a.m. the following morn-
ing that Guinness scored a techni-
cal(?) knock-out over Smith in the
21st round, Trinity having been for-
gotten long ago.
9-8 WIN
Sunday saw the visit to Navan
Rugby Club for the first game of the
tour. After travelling through a snow-
storm en route the players found a
pitch in similar condition to them-
selves. However, with Pine in his
usual sparkling form, the tough
Navan forwards were gradually over-
come by a recovering I.C. team. De-
spite a gale force wind the ball was
thrown around with gay abandon and
I.C. eventually ran out worthy win-
ners by 9—8, thanks to tries by
" Doddy," Riley and Bell.
At the dance that evening Powell
and Vickerstaff indulged in a high-
land fling that had Robbie Burns
turning in his grave.
FAST T.C.D
On Monday the team travelled to
Trinity College to face a big, fast ex-
perienced Trinity XV. The events of
the previous night solved the prob-
lem of team selection and it was 15
apprehensive black and blue jerseys
that took the field. However, last
night was soon forgotten and I.C.
opened with some of their finest
Rugby of the season, treating the
large number of spectators to a feast
of open Rugby. However keen
T.C.D. tackling prevented a rout,
and I.C. were unlucky only to have 11
points on the board at half-time, due
to Bell, a hard-working forward,
Dodson and Earl, none of which were
converted thanks to some inglorious
shots at goal. Unfortunately half-
time brought snow, hail and anything
else the heavens could offer. The
game then closed up some and after
Vickerstaff had put one of the T.C.D.
second rows to sleep, some time
before his usual bedtime, the game
warmed up to offset the effects of the
snow. However Irish tempers proved
nothing to match the soothing effect
of the I.C. pack and order was soon
restored. Doddy then went on to
score another fine try which Riley
converted with a magnificent kick
from under the posts.
RECORD BROKEN ?
Tuesday was the I.C. Sabbath and
the day was spent trying to break the
Guuinness drinking record. As the
recorder was the first to fall the
record was only broken unofficially.
In the evening Williams, suitably
aided by Kelly, entertained the Lime-
light Club to the green green grass of
home and many other Welsh ditties.
She was closely followed by that
merry ploughboy John Lum with a
selection of Irish ballads, though the
Irish didn't seem to recognise them
as such.
U.C.D. BEATEN
The final game against U.C.D. was
nearly a tragedy due to their turning
out a young, fit, extremely keen side.
However the old old hands in the I.C.
front row — Casson, Powell and
O'Reilly—soon subdued the fiery Irish
forwards with their experience and
with Lum dominating the line-outs,
I.C. managed to provide ample ball
for the three-quarters. John Earl
dropped two beautiful goals and
John Kelly, showing all his early fire
and determination went over for a
magnificent try. Time after time I.C.
were saved , by Pine whose defence
was as secure as the Rock of Gibral-
tar and I.C. eventually ran out worthy
victors by 9 points against 3.
On the whole a grand tour was en-
joyed by the College and the be-
haviour and spirit, both on and off
the field, left behind with the Irish a
very favourable impression of I.C.

E very difficult when you get out on your
own. Everything suddenly, frighteningly ^pensive. Ends
hardly ever seeming to meet. The Westmiast r can help
you, as it helps thousands of young people cveiy ear.
1. As you get into your stride. You'll soon have money
decisions to make (types of insurance, mortgage problems,
and so on). Your local Westminster Manager has immense
experience of such problems. Let him help you draw up a
personal budget that will give you a chance to build up a
small reserve of capital.
2. The price of success. The more successful you are, the
more expenses you will have. And the more you'll need
to keep track of where your money's going. Clothes,
entertainment, foreign travel, children's education. The
Westminster gives you a precise record of how you spend
your money and will pay all your regular bills by ' standing
order'.
3. When you reach the top. Sooner or later you'll have to
invest quite substantial sums of personal capital. The quality
of your life after retirement depends on how you do it. The
best advice comes from someone who knows you. That's
when you're doubly glad you joined the Westminster early,
and built up a good relationship with your Manager.
4. A word about your Manager. His instinct is not to
warn, but to help. Call in on your local Westminster
Manager—you'll see what an up-to-date bank can do. And
you'll probably find he is prepared to reduce the cost of your
bank charges in the early years of your career.
Have a talk this week with your local Westminster
Manager. Ask how he can help you in your career. The
Westminster has over 1,380 branches in England and
Wales. Head Office: 41 Lothbury, London, EC2.
