This was not actually the sailing club on an Easter cruise, nearer the
Goon Show on safari. The cruise was better nlanned, and eaually enjoyable.
CRUISING
A L O N G
Over the Easter vacation, about 37
people put out to sea in various small
boats under the auspices of the Deep
Sea Section of the Sailing Club. This
section has recently expanded rapidly,
seven boats being charterecr^this
time from Lymington, Salcombe and
Maldon in Essex, the cruises cover-
ing a total distance of nearly .3000
miles.
FLAG PLANTED
Among other things, the Torrey
Canyon was visited, the Scilly Isles
circumnavigated and the French
canals and rivers sailed upon. The
Imperial College flag was planted on
most of the Channel Isles, and the
South and East coasts, of England
were thoroughly explored. One boat
defied nature by beating into a force
8 gale, whilst the crews of the two
East Coast hpats witnessed, another
yacht blow up and sink at close quar-
ters, fortunately no one being injured
CHARTER FEES
The main object of the section is
to give members experience of deep-
saa sailing, navigation and seaman-
ship. The only difficulty is one of
money—the charter fees are all paid
put of members' pockets. The Union
has gone someway towards alleviating
this by generously providing money
for safety equipment and charts, but
the ultimate goal must still remain
a boat of our own with which to win
ocean races.

On Friday, March 24th, fifteen
members of the club left England by
the night boat from Harwich to the
Hook of Holland. Arriving W '6.30
a.m., we took a train to Amsterdam
and thence to Alkmaar, about 30 kilo-
metres away. We remained there for
three days and took part in an inter-
national festival. The games were
played on Sunday and Monday. On
Sunday, I.C. played against Lyons
University, an Alkmaar side and a
side from the Hoek, H.D.M. Draw-
ing the first game against Lyons, I.C.
went on to win the next two games
and this half of the draw. The final
was . played on Monday against
" Clipper "Hamburg, a side contain-
ing three internationals. This game
was played in very wet conditions and
I.C. held their own, but for one total
breakthrough of which Clipper took
full advantage. We thus lost 1—2
and came second in the festival.
While in Alkmaar, the sides stayed
with members of the home club and
were showered with an embarrassing
amount of hospitality. No one was
allowed a second's boredom.
GRONONGEN
On Monday evening, we left with
our hosts for, the next three days,
Forward, the Gronongen University
side, who had also been at the festi-
val. Unfortunately, due to the rain,
outdoor hockey was out of the ques-
tion, so Forward took us sailing,
sightseeing, wined and dined us in
great style and arranged some indodr
hockey. We took to this game very
quickly and in a friendly tournament
did not disgrace ourselves, nor that
evening did we disgrace our hosts
when they provided us with a limit-
less supply of liquor.
HOMEWARDS
On Friday, 31st March, we returned
to Amsterdam where we visited the
Heineken Brewery and did some
sightseeing. The night was spent in
a hotel recommended to us by For-
ward and we left Holland the nex\
day with many very pleasant memo-
ries.
U. L. CHAMPS
I. C. take Womens Athletics Cup
This year's U.L. Championships,
Jd last Friday and Saturday, pro-
iced some twenty contested events.
There were some outstanding results,
and I.C. ended with three cups in its
possession—two individual and one
team. The latter—the Sherwood
Challenge Cup for Women — is
awarded on a factor basis. Thus the
points scored are multiplied by a
factor, based on the number of
women in each college—so I.C. had
a generous allowance. However, this
in no way detracts from the meri-
torious achievement, particularly as
our points were scored by only two
competitors. Ann Burrell, who re-
tained her high jump title, gained the
80m. hurdles and was second in the
long jump-y-and Margaret Lumley
was second in the hurdles.
BARTON WINS
In the competition for the remain-
ing three cups, I.C. were unplaced in
the "Men's Factor Cup," were third
in the " Roseberry Men's Cup," only
a few points behind U.C., but some
way behind Guy's Hospital (last
year's winners), and were third in the
" Imperial College Women's Cup,"
behind Royal Free Hospital and
Royal Holloway College.
Individual cups were won by Nick
Barton, in the 880, and Mike Evans,
in the high jump. N. Barton re-
covered well, from being boxed in at
the start, to take the lead during the
first lap, and hung on to win in 1 min.
58.5 sec. This was slightly slower
than his last time, and by no means
as easy a race. As expected M. Evans
main rival was team-mate Mole
Weaver, and a close competition re-
sulted. Both cleared 5 ft. 10 in., and
failing at 6ft—M. Evans won with
fewer failures.
CONVINCING WIN
FOR BECK
From I.C.'s point of view, the per-
formance most worthy of a cup was
by Richard Beck, in the 440. How*
ever, there is no cup for this event.
R. Beck won convincingly, beating
:hampion I. Morgan (Guys), and
achieved a personal best of 49.4, just
0.3 sees, outside the College record.
This was after running two fast 220s
—finishing second in the final.
Another College athlete who
achieved a personal best was Paul
Jones, who increased his best triple
jump to 45 ft. 1 in.—this with a below
full offered attempt, to end a sequence
of no jumps. However, John Myers
(St. Mary's) won with a jump of
48 ft. lin.—this beating the Univer-
sity record, held by ex-I.C. jumper D.
Smith. Former Cambridge athlete,
Dwamoa Adu, now of U.C.H. was
second on 46 ft. 9in.
LONG JUMP
In the long jump, a disappointed
Derek Wade managed only 21 ,ft.
H i in. and had to concede victory
to his Belgrave Harriers clubmate
John Mitchell (Royal Free Hospital).
The latter also found time between
jumps to win the 100 yds., but, due to
a blustery headwind, his time was
only 10.4 sees. I.C. produced three
of the placed runners in the steeple-
chase. Howard Smith finished 3rd,
and Tony Mason, running his first
steeplechase, finished 5th. Dave
Downie cleared only 9 ft. 6 in. in
the pole vault—a foot below his best
winter jump—andfinished4th. With
training his form should begin to re-
turn.
SUCCESS
Unexpected points were gained in
the 120 yds. hurdles, where College
champions (Ten Weh Sam), after
leading all the way, lost to Domaigne
(Guys) in thefinishingstraight. Neil
Johnson (I.C:) ended in fifth place.
As expected, the College results in the
field events were poor—there was only
one thrower competing. With more
competitions in this sphere, I.C. might
well have won the championships.
This was one of I.C.'s more success-
ful championships, and as a result I.C.
should now be providing a propor-
tion of the U.L. team. Consequently
the college team, for this term's
matches, will be somewhat reduced in
strength. Thus new members will be
needed —• anyone interested should
contact the club and watch the notice
board.
