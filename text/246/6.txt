ENGINEER
by Martin Walker
In one sense Prof. Laithwaite fits the popular picture of the good-
natured but non-nonsense practical engineer. But he also has wide
interests outside his field of heavy electrical machines. He founded
a pop group in 1935, and has published papers in entomological
journals on the love life of months. Beginning his career as an instru-
ment repairman in the RAF, he didn't discover electrical engineering
until he was 21. Since then, he has never looked back. He is now
well known for his work on the linear induction motor and his " Pro-
pulsion Without Wheels." He is married with four children.

One hears a lot in this country
about ideas which die at the ex-
perimental stage without being
developed commercially. Do
you consider this a serious prob-
lem ? If so, what is being done
about it ?
This is quite a serious problem.
However, quite a lot is being done
about it, particularly by Lord Jack-
son who is pushing for greater co-
operation between university depart-
ments and industry. It doesn't affect
me personally, because I seem to be
getting my ideas developed by indus-
try.
Do you think that money for
development is more readily
available in America ? Have you
been tempted to go there ?
Yes, it is. And I have had offers
to go to America. But I have never
been tempted to go. I am very Eng-
lish, I suppose.
You have described the job of
engineering as the economic ex-
ploitation of observed pheno-
mena, the main objectives of the
engineer being to make money.
What, then, does an engineer do
in a university besides teaching ?
Well, my kind of engineer spends
his time inventing. An engineer actu-
ally is not so much concerned with
truths as he is with concepts. He
tries to devise new concepts and to
select from them those which are pro-
fitableâ€”both for himself, and for his
company. I am Very interested in en-

gineering in industry, and assist by

Who would own the develop-
ment rights on a device of some
sort discovered or invented by a
professor at a university in the
course of his work ?
Let me answer this by saying what
happens in a case in point. At the
moment I happen to have a couple of
patentable ideas. The National Re-
search and Development Corporation
will finance the patent, which is taken
out by three parties : the inventor,
the college, and the Corporation. The
N.R.D.C. will then try to exploit the
idea commercially. There is a
revenue sharing agreement between
the college and the N.R.D.C., and the
college decides what the inventor's
share will be. An engineer is actu-
ally better off financially as an acade-
mic than he would be in industry for
this reason. In industry his ideas
would belong solely to his company.
What qualities do you think
make a good engineer ?
Primarily an awareness of three
dimensions, an intuitive consciousness
of three-dimensioned objects, and the
ability to correlate the feel and sight
of objects. Some of this is inborn,
and some acquired early in life. A
good engineer may be made or
broken as a small child depending on
whether he acquires this feel for solid
objects or not. He must also be
sound in logical argument of the sort
used in mathematics, although he
needn't be a good mathematician.
But most of all he must have enthu-
siasm for his subject and the will to
