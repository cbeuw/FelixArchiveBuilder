Once more the silly season is
with us. This is the time of the
year when the majority of the
students, at this college, try to
find time for some revision and
examinations. However, most of
them are busy with militant non-
support of the Charity Carnival,
or enthusiastic and heated disin-
terest in who will be what in the
Union next year, so this is often
a difficult task. In fact this
proves to be so difficult, in some
cases, that they do not find time
for any work and they do not
even bother to take their exams
at all. But not to worry, they
rest safe in the knowledge that
they can plead severe mental
strain, and then the college can
arrange for them to repeat the
year with a renewed grant. This
is becoming particularly common
in certain departments of RCS
and whilst there are, no doubt,
genuine cases of mental strain,
for many it is just the easiest way
out. The worst feature of all is
that the people who run the
Union or take any active part in
Union activities are usually so
overworked that their academic
work suffers. Such people are
not likely to miss their exams,
taking them with a "Death be-
fore dishonour" spirit. This
means that, in many cases they
either fail or get a worse degree
than they otherwise might have
done and because they have taken
their exams they have no chance
to repeat, or if they do, it is
without a grant. All this makes
Free
University of
West Berlin
from FACTOR
The West Berlin City Authorities
were made to look slightly ridiculous
when students were accused of plot-
ting to kill Hubert Humphrey, the
U.S. Vice-President. Eleven people
were arrested including eight students.
A court later ruled that the students
should be freed for lack of evidence.
The students are now being called
' The Custard-Pie Assassins " in West
Germany. The " Chemical Bombs "
that the city authorities said were to
be used to kill the Vice-President were
harmless smoke bombs. The students
said that the smoke was to be used
to disorganise the police while they
plastered the Vice-President with bags
of flour, yoghourt, cream cakes and
custard pies.
1,000 students staged demonstrations
during the visit.
"RED "PROVOS ?
The arrested students belong to a
provc-type organisation that has con-
tacts with the Chinese Embassy in
East Berlin. Both the East Germans
and the West Berlin authorities are
trying to crush them.
West Berlin authorities are anti-
student anyway. Free University stu-
dents were recently called "the red
louse in_ the fur of the Berlin Bear,"
and the city authorities have recom-
mended to the University Administra-
tion that any student taking part in
demonstrations against U.S. policy in
Vietnam should be expelled at once. "
one wonder whether, in the less
genuine cases, the college isn't
taking child psychology a little
too far.
This year, thanks to the cour-
age of people like Jerry Stock-
bridge and his men, the Carnival
Board has at last broadened its
outlook. It has realised that the
way to make a lot of money is
not by taking it from the same
faithful few who support most
Union activities, but to appeal
more to the general public. They
have also spread the work more
evenly over the three constituent
colleges, and at last the Carnival
looks like making a substantial
profit. The Folk concert in the
Albert Hall is a step in the right
direction, and perhaps next year
the more useless functions like
the garden fete will be dropped.
The efforts of this year's commit-
tee are self-evident. There is a
spate of little green posters radia-
ting out from the college in all
directions; not even Harrods'
windows are inviolate, and nor
it seems were the twenty or so
students who had their names
taken by the 'bules. But still the
fact remains that the majority
of students in this college, espec-
ially the P.G.s, do not support
carnival at all, and most of the
work is done by the same faithful
few.
The owners of the following cards

The Treble, which has now finished,
made a profit of £55 lis. 6d. Parti-
cipation in the competition—its first
year of existence—was very encourag-
ing for future years. Estimates show
that around 10 per cent of I.C. Under-
graduates bought shares although
It was, no doubt, this that
caused the overworked people on
the Carnival Board to slip up
over the production of the carni-
val mag. This remarkable work
seems to have been printed witiT
its destination on the cover. It's
a pity that Mr. Peter Potter
didn't think of the waste of Car-
nival funds before he inserted his
lavatory-wall sections. It seems
that the original draft was care-
fully vetted by the Carnival
Board and certain sections re-
moved. Instead of replacing them
with less " blue" material, the
editor choose to replace them
with sections that were humor-
less and obscene. Presumably
the Carnival Board didn't have
time to re-check the proofs and
£140 worth of magazines were
printed. Tony Duke quite rightly
withdrew them and ordered their
destruction, and that was sup-
posedly that, but it is a well-
known fact that many copies are
still in existence and are being
sold for about 7/6 each. A promi-
nent member of the Union was
heard to remark Well, at least
we've recouped about £50." I've
always thought that destroyed
means "burnt" and not "dis-
posed of in an underhand man-
ner." If you want a copy try
122, 362, or 612, but don't tell the
President about it.

At the CND Annual General Meet-

to succeed Malcolm Duckett of
ICCND.
After greetings had been exchanged
with the Socialist Society it was de-
cided that more joint action should
be promoted on issues like Vietnam.

Phoenix has been published at
last, despite the lack of support
from most of the college. Mike
Wilson has managed to put to-
gether one of the best issues in
recent years. He is now faced
with the problem of selling it
when nobody wants to help. Per-
haps the President should ban it
and then it would sell itself.
Sorry, Robb, banning FELIX
wouldn't have the same effect,
The Maths department has just
fitted new locks on its doors'as a
result of the long-distance phone
call farce. It was supposedly from
this department that somebody
spent most nights phoning Nor-
way and running up a large bill.
So far the only people who have
suffered in any way are the Profs,
in the department who are lock-
ing themselves out. Meanwhile
rumours are still going around
about who was responsible and
anybody who is known to have
spent a few weeks in Norway
seems suspect. A well-informed
Icwarian seemed to think that she
knew the culprit. She would not
say who, but merely inferred that
it was a well-knownfigurein the
Union. The college might have
been better employed trying to
find the culprit, rather than lock-
ing the stable doors. . . .

scenity and libel." Potter agreed to
these cuts, but later without a consult-
ing the Committee, inserted a further
body of more, rather than less, ob-
scene material, resulting in " Bog's "
final form. The copies were printed
over the vacation. Jerry Stockbridge
has since received a bill for 3,000
copies, although several informed
sources consider that 4,000 were pro-
duced.
SOLD IN MINES
They were delivered to the Union
Office at the beginning of term.
It seems that the original plan was to
sell as many -as possible for a limited
period of two days—at least to cover
costs—and then to have it banned ,to
prevent it spreading too far. Be that
as it may, on Tuesday, as reported in
the last issue of FELIX, Duke, to-
gether with the Executive, decided to
ban " Bog " for obscenity in the ex-
treme—apparently too late and in-
completely. On Tuesday afternoon
Mines Vice-President John O'Reilly,
unaware of the ban, removed the
Mines quota from the Union office.
On hearing of the ban O'Reilly
handed practically all of his stock to
Carnival man Frank Morris. It is
said that three were sold for the
stated price of 2/6 in Mines. The im-
mediate effect of the ban was to raise
the price, in a few cases to 10/-, be-
fore it settled to a steady 5/-.
£100 TAKEN ?
Although Potter will now have to
pay for the printing by further, stunts,
it is certain that the total of £123 will
in any case be offset by sales of
banned copies—if only to a limited
extent. Tony Duke has made some
effort to burn as many copies as pos-
sible—a few were even retrieved from
early buyers—and puts the takings at
around £40. Others consider £80 or
even £100 more likely and it is not
impossible that the full cost could be
found. 500 copies seemed to have
escaped incineration. If each is sold
the magazine could break even.
