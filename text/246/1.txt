Architectural Association as Fourth College

delays finance
The execution of the plan for the amalgamation of the School of
the Architectural Association and Imperial College is running into
difficulties over finance. The University Grants Committee, who
must necessarily meet the recurrent operating costs of a school for 380
New university students—estimated at £210,000—have mot yet agreed
to the proposals. A decision is expected in the Autumn. However
there are growing fears about the outcome of the decision.
In addition, a large number of students at the A.A. are against
the amalgamation.
When the plan was submitted in
1964 to the Architectural Association,
it was hoped that the U.G.G. would
also provide the initial capital for the
site—on the IC " campus "•—and the
construction of a building to house
the school. The sum required, is esti-
mated at £670,000. Due to the freeze,
and the decrease in university ex-
pansion after the Robbins era, the
U.G.C. is proving to be parsimonious.
BEHIND SCHEDULE
The plan for the amalgamation was
formally agreed upon by the two
bodies in 1964. However, the imple-
mentation of the proposals has
already dropped behind schedule—for
to quote from a paper setting out the
proposals at that time—
" It is hoped that the proposals set
out in this paper might be progres-
sively implemented so that they would
be fully operative at the beginning of
the 1967-72 quinquennium . "
It is vital to the Architectural As-
sociation that a positive decision from
the U.G.C. be obtained within the
next six months. The lease on their
present premises at Bedford Square,
W.C.I, terminates in 1972 Before
accepting further students next year
(the course takesfiveyears), they must
obviously be sure of a building to
house the school from that date.
RESERVATIONS
STUDENTS
FROM AA
The plan is running into further
difficulties from opposition by AA
students. In a letter to the Times last
month, last term's chairman of AA
student union claimed that two-thirds
of the students were opposed to the
merger. This term's chairman, Chris
Libbe, does not agree however and
stated : " It was a pointless letter to
write."
Libbe might be doing his utmost to
crush opposition, but there un-
doubtedly exists a large amount of
opposition among the students to the
amalgamation.

A banned Rag Mag is more inter-
esting than a readily available one.
Tony Duke might have banned the
Rag Mag but sales Have since soared.
According to Duke three thousand
copies were printed and those three
thousand copies were meant to be
burnt. Duke was alleged to have
said that only two copies were out-
standing. Already about 200 copies
have been sold under the counter at
Southside.
The Executive is turning a blind
eye to this activity in the hope that
some of the printing costs will be re-
couped.
Peter Potter, the editor of "Bog,'
Staff, have been asked to raise some
of the cost of the printing by carnival
stunts and " other means."
Since\ the original idea some five
months ago, " Bog " has always been
a rather doubtful concern. It started
as a private venture. The staff, apart
from its blonde editor, included Bob
Russell, ex-FELIX cartoonist, now at
Art School, and several other mem-
bers of Aeso I.
Towards the end of last term the
proofs were shown to the Carnival
Committee, who censored a certain
portion of the magazine for " ob-

MAY
BALL
CHAOS
The May Ball proved a fiasco
as twsfoap followed mishap due to
chaotic organisation. £139, in-
tended for the artists at the Ball,
was lc* \j the Chairman of
the Entertainments Committee,
Stewart Chapman. The Carnival
Queenfinalists,to be elected on
the night, had to buy their own
tickets—hence one of the finalists
refused to attend — and the
crowning ceremony failed as
crown and gown were lost.
"It was like a ightmare," said
Chapman, when FELIX interviewed
him on Sunday over the missing £139.
Chairman drew £139" in cash to pay
for the artists at the Ball, but fearing
that more drink would make him ir-
responsible, he handed the money to
his gfr! nd, a second year under-
grade., v k Chemistry. She placed
it in her sir. ;vening-bag. Later she
was reported to be sick. According
to Chapman :
" She apparently tripped and fell
down the Stairs in the Union and
walked out in a daze. I didn't see her
—she left at about 1.30 a.m."
Chapman was later alleged to be
walking around carrying a bottle of
whisky, unaware of the fate of his
girl-friend and the money.
However Chapman stated :
" 1finallyphoned her home in the
morning and she was there but
couldn't rem mber anything that had
happened. She was badlyv_
uised and
had obviously had a b accident.
At 8 o'clock on Saturday evening we
found the wallet—empty—on a ledge
outside the window of the artists
dressing-room. The police could find
no fingerprints on it.
On Sunday the artists at the Ball
had still not been paid.
Meanwhile Jerry Stockbridge,
Carnival Cc-ordinator, looked for
about two hours before he found the
Carnival Queen's crown and cloak.
Apart from Ann Hay, ICWA presi-
dent, the other finalists were not sent
tickets. Sue Gibbs therefore did not
attend and Vanita Deshmukh had to
buy her own ticket. With the finalists
for Queen then reduced to two,
Vanita was finally crowned as
Queen,,
