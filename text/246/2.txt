Has Muggeridge had
enough ?
The latest obsession with Mal-
colm Muggeridge seems to be
Christianity. This was the chief
point emerging from his very
interesting General Studies lec-
tures on the last day of the last
term.
Beginning his talk after a very loud
round of applause, Mr. Muggeridge
started off by talking about his
" medium "—the " telly " as he called
it—which, as he later admitted, he
frequents so often to bolster his ego.
But some points made by him were
perhaps frightening, and certainly most
pertinent, to the subject in question.
He began by citing " Wagon Train "
and " Peyton Place " as examples of
the Western world's chief exports to
the developing countries. This he
thought symbolised the failure of
Western civilisation and technology.
He claimed, I think correctly, that
our knowledge of ourselves has re-
mained almost stagnant while techno-
logy has overtaken us—one only has
to go to Montreal's Expo. '67 to
realise this. His view seemed to
imply that the growth of advanced
technological methods and products(
all material goods, somehow hamper,
or have hampered till now, the paral-
lel growth of spiritual humanitarian
knowledge and that it leads to the
suffocation and stagnation of culture.
Mr. Muggeridge's fears stem in the
main from his basic belief that some-
thing has gone wrong with western
civilisation and that it will continue
to decline. He asserted' that the main
fault in the Utopia as imagined by
our forebears—and almost accom-
plished by the Scandinavian countries
—was the basic assumption that the
gratification of the need for material
goods and sensual pleasure is the pre-
requisite to human happiness. His
answer to everything lay in a " re-
turn " to Christianity as the guiding
light of people's lives.
Mr. iMuggeridge now seems to be
preaching complete puritanism: the
restraint of bodily desires as the path
to " happiness." This he calls Chris-
tianity. In view of his derision of the
" establishment" Christian Church,
and despite his qualifying statement,
" I say Christianity, being a Western
European," I would still attack him
on being narrow-minded, especially
since this comes from a person as
cosmopolitan as he. The principles
he holds form the basis of
most religions — certainly Hinduism
and Buddhism—and the keystone of
Yoga : in short a " Mind over Mat-
ter." So what new has Mr. Mugger-
idge to offer 7

Maths & Physics
Society Dinner
Excellent food, speeches containing
good clean jokes and nothing of a
smutty nature. These were the major
features of a highly successful Maths
and Physics Society Dinner held in
Southside Senior Common Room.
A new innovation this year was a
demonstration given by Dr. Warne-
Beresford, President of the British
Society of Hypnotherapists, an un-
usual and interesting addition to the
usual speech, discussing the wacs and
limitations of hypnotism for curative
purposes.

N e w s from
the o t h e r
fifty states
from FACTOR
From America we hear that at
OREGON STATE UNIVER-
SITY, " The man in a black bag"
is attending a lecture course. Nobody
except the lecturer in charge knows
who he is. He comes to lectures com-
pletely covered by a black bag except
for a pair of bare feet sticking out of
the bottom. In conversations with
students and newspaper reporters he
says he is doing it as a philosophical
experiment."
MICHIGAN STATE UNI-
VERSITY, after two students
were disciplined for kissing each other
an campus, 600 students took part in
a mass kiss-in."
At FLORIDA STATE UNI-
VERSITY an 18-year-old girl
student was disciplined for posing
nude for photos in a university
administrative building. A banner
was seen saying " nude power."
At FORDHAM UNIVER-
SITY (N.Y.) an experiment in
teaching is to be carried out in the
newly-formed Bensalem College.
There will be 30 students and staff in
the college. No formal classes or
exams are planned. Students and
staff will plan the syllabus together
and will be free to go on foreign ex-
changes, civil right and peace corps
work. The only entrance qualifica-
tion is to have a working knowledge
of URDU, of all things. " We hope
to make life so interesting that stu-
dents won't need LSD," said the or-
ganiser.
At PRINCETON UNIVER-
SITY a survey of 150 under-
graduates by a student group indicates
that up to 15 per cent of Princeton's
3,500 students may use mild drugs
such as Marijuana, LSD and Hashish.
No evidence of " hard " drug taking
(heroin, cocaine, etc.) was found.
Atom Power
is cheaper
says Penney
He then gave a brief outline of the
use of the moderator to transfer neu-
tron energy to thermal energy, and the
effect of increasing fissions proba-
bility by slowing the neutrons. Next
he described the principles of several
types of reactor as developed by the
U.K.A.E.A. He started with the
Boiling Water Reactor and its low
efficiency of about 30 per cent, and
included a mention of the methods of
controlling the speed of reaction. He
then went on to describe the pressur-
ised water reactor, with about the
same efficiency, and the gas-cooled
reactor, with an efficiency of up to
43 per cent. He explained that one
large cause of the low efficiencies with
gas-cooled reactors was the use of
heat exchangers and steam turbo-
alternators. He predicted that this
would give way to gas turbines de-
livering up to a hundred megawatts.
He finished this section of his talk
with an outline of the fast reactor at
Dounreay, with its double heat ex-
changing system using 1000 tons of
liquid sodium, and its ability to breed
fuel at a greater rate than it uses it.
Sex
change
in IC
Exec.
Those of us who, having nothing
better to do di/ring Tuesday lunch-
time, read SENNET, will, no doubt,
have noticed some controversy re-
cently over I.C.'s men-only bar.
In last week's issue, our beloved
president defended this practice of
segregation ; thus one would assume
that in this, a year of strong presi-
dency, former traditions—especially
this one—would be upheld.
This being the case, it is the un-
pleasant duty of FELIX to reveal to
its readers a sad increase in the sex-
ratio at IC.
Last Sunday evening, any self-re-
specting member of the Union, in
entering this male preserve, would
have been shocked to observe that
three former members of ICWA (in-
cluding their president Ann Hay)
supping in the bar. Since Howard
made no attempt to remove these
three one can only assume that he was
" in the know" concerning this sad
biological state of -affairs. Djai
Howell, strange to relate, seemed un-
perturbed by the affair.
However one shudders to think of
the consequences if the change had
occurred after the Carnival Queen
elections—that is, if Ann Hay had
been elected.
None of these ex-Icwarians has yet
disclosed which Sunday newspaper
gets their story.
The other section was a brief talk
on the economics, where Sir William
said that cost considerations are far
more involved than is usually realised
in such effects as production costs for
very large structures, methods of
transportation of such structures and
the safety standards imposed. He
claimed that nuclear power stations
now provide electricity at a cost 25
per cent cheaper than coal-fired
stations.
He pointed out that these stations
are economically affected by commer-
cial, political, and scale considera-
tions.
During coffee after the lecture, Sir
William exposed the apparent greater
efficiency of the Tennessee valley
stations as a mathematical trick on the
part of the Americans, which makes
about 70 per cent, difference in the
cost of electricity.
The lecture, which was attended by
about one hundred people, was illus-
trated by a set of slides, showing
British nuclear power stations.

" It is possible to prove anything," said Sir William Penney, the
new Rector of Imperial College, on, the economics of nuclear tech-
nology at the Wells Society on Monday, 1st May.
Sir William started his lecture by running over the basic fission
process used in all nuclear reactors, and! the processes necessary in
order to get enriched fuel.
