Theatre
Miss Julie - Strindburg
Judgement - Kafka
Intimacy - Sartre
At the Cafe Theatre of the Bear and
Staffpub, 37 Charing Cross Road.
This triple bill of works by Classic
writers is an ambitious undertaking by
the Artuad Company and provides
one of the most interesting theatrical
programmes on in London at the
moment.
"Miss Julie" tells of how a Count's
valet, Jean, exploits the infatuation
that Julie (his masters mad daughter)
has for him in order to get enough
money to get away and start a new
life. The play is performed frequently
and can be tedious and cliched, but
by using updated language, Paul
Hick's production remains fresh and
original thoughout, and this is helped
by Adam Maxwell's portrayal of Jean
as laid-back yet calculating. However
there are times when the play flags
and Shane Valey sometimes goes over
the top as the insane Julie.
"Judgement" is Micheal Almaz's
adaptation of Kafka's writings dealing
with his early life and emotional
conflicts over his dying father, his
fiancee whom he does not love and
his suppressed homosexuality. The
play never reaches any satisfactory
dramatic climax, but does portray
Kafka's isolation and confusion with
subtlety and clarity.
It is notoriously difficult to write a
convincing female role, let alone an
all-woman play. Hence Jean-Paul
Satre's "Intimacy" is a gem. Two
best-friends have man-trouble; Lulu
is about to leave her impotent husband
for a young lover, and Rirette is now
alone. The play studies their
individual feelings, and what happens
when Lulu finally leaves Henri, and
the sexual attraction they have for one
another but that they try to ignore.
"Intamacy" produced some of the
most imaginative staging of the
evening, and I found it most
enjoyable.
All three productions deal with the
strong sexual drives that can force
people into making unwise, even
fatal, decisions. Despite some dubious
acting, all were memorable and
rewarding versions of fine plays. The
Theatre programme changes regularly
and plays can be seen singularly or
together, but it is not only the actual
shows that make it well worth a visit,
the theatre itself and the pub beneath
are excellent and the whole
atmosphere is warm, friendly and
inviting.

Road - The Royal Court Theatre
Road has returned to the Royal Court
Theatre for short run from the 19
Janurary to the 28 February. It is
short considering the amount of effort
that turns the whole of the stalls of
the theatre into a walk around stage.
Jim Cartwright's play ended another
short run last summer after it was
transferred from the much smaller
theatre upstairs. I saw the play last
June when Eddie Tenpole, of Tenpole
Tudor and Sex Pistols background
took the leading part, this time it stars
Ian Dury as a man of the street in this
small Lancashire town. The play, as
it rambles on from scenes inside
houses on a council estate, eavesdrops
on short snatches taken from the lives
of the inhabitants. It is an attempt to
recreate and follow the lives of people
in an informal walk-around manner.
One simply walks on and around the
action, never more than six feet away
from the dialogue. The audience too
becomes part of the play; I made a
terrible acting debut when I had to
dance passionately with ? young girl!
I should also mention how
disconcerting it is to have people
acting in front of your face, to speak
and look into your eyes, without the
glare of stage-lights. The whole play
is two-way, sometimes the audience
can't look at its own shame of being
there, so intimately involved. At other
times the cast look to be enjoying this
magnificant play too much to be
consistently depraved.
More than that, if you like Ian
Dury, its likely to be the closest you
ever get to him.

Film
Rocinante
This film made by the Cinema
Action group is a rather strange
mixture of fantasy, fact, illusion and
realism with no obvious running
theme.
It centres around a character
called Bill (John Hurt) who leaves
his projections of landscapes in a
derelict cinema and goes in search of
the real thing in his aimless
meanderings around the Wild West
country of England he is trailed by a
present day jester, whose strange
appearance and uncanny powers are
well portrayed by Ian Dury.
Bill crosses paths with Jess
(Maureen Douglas) who is trying to
infiltrate the computer network of
the Coal Board shortly after the
miner's strike. Both she and the
jester seem to be enticing Bill to
adventure with their strange words
and dark secrets, but rather
disappointingly nothing actually
comes of it.
However, if you don't go into the
cinema expecting Crocodile Dundee
and don't try to derive too much
meaning from particular events, the
film's rather bizzare characters and
its almost surreal images can be
appreciated.
Once you realise that Bill does not
have and ulterior motive or reason
for his actions and that you know
just as much about what he's doing
as he does, it is possible to identify
with him; then, you can just sit back
and enjoy the spectacular views of
Jhe English West Country. Viv
Heavenly
Pursuits
In 'Heavenly Pursuits', Tom Conti
plays a remedial teacher (Vic
Matthews) in Glasgow, whose
aetheist views seem to make him a
prime target for a whole host of
'miracles' designed to convert the
unbelieving. The concept of
miracles is not new to him as he
teaches at a small Catholic school
named after Edith Semple, a former
'miracle worker' who lived at the
turn of the century. Vic struggles
hard to quash rumours that he is the
next Edith Semple, aided by fellow
teacher Ruth Chancellor (Helen
Mirren), and instead channels his
energy into improving his pupils'
literacy.
Much as I like Tom Conti, he gets
the film off to a bad start by
wandering around like a love-sick
puppy. However, he soon redeems
himself and gives a good
performance as an ordinary man
driven mad by 'miracle hysteria',
Helen Mirren is pleasingly cast as
Ruth, good at below-the-belt
retorts. The story-line however
meanders along and at times
disappears completely.
'Heavenly Pursuits' is a harmless
comedy that will give an evening's
entertainment, although personally
I would not rush out to see it.
