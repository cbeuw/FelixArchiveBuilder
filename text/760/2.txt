Consoc
apology
Dear Dave,
I would like to pass on Mr
Goosen's apologies to all those who
turned up to hear him speak on South
Africa's future. As you will know, the
meeting had to be cancelled because
Mr Goosen had gone down with food
poisoning.
I would also like to assure you that
IC Consoc will be arranging another
meeting as soon as possible and
preferably before the end of term. IC
Consoc like Anti-Apartheid looks for-
ward to the end of Apartheid in South
Africa and we believe that Mr
Goosen's talk should be of great in-
terest to anyone concerned about
South Africa's future.
Yours sincerely,
Simon Jarvis
External Affairs Officer,
IC Conservative Society
PATA
response
Dear Dave,
When Paul Kapusta was allowed to
revive PATA (Positive Alternatives
to Abortion Society) it was after some
discussion. This was to the effect that
in keeping with the aims of this socie-
ty he would have to discuss alter-
natives as well as presenting the anti-
abortion case. Sadly, I have to date
seen little or no evidence of such a
discussion. Perhaps he could
enlighten us on this seemingly under-
publicised area of his activities.
Yours,
Chas Jackson

This week's news section includes, in
the report of the cancelled Consoc
speaker meeting, details of an
interview with Mr Peter Goosen of
the South African Embassey. Mr
Goosen cancelled his visit to College
because of food poisoning. Much of
what he said would have formed the
basis of his talk and, as he says, he is
keen to come to College to put
forward his views. We have printed
what he saidas accurately aspossible.
The interview he gave FELIX was
taped by the Embassy, and Mr
Goosen asked to be shown the copy
beforepublication. We agreed to this;
in the event the only changes he
advised were minor ones-not
affecting the article in any way other
than to amend a couple of genuine
inaccurracies.
What we have printed is, ofcourse,
a series of "Press Office" statements
from the South African Government.
Personally I find nearly all of what
Mr Goosen has said condescending
and rather offensive. At thesame time
I do not think it helpful to adopt a "no
platform policy" in our press
coverage of the South African
situation. I have sympathy with the
view that groups whose ideologies are
particularly extreme should be
prevented from broadcasting their
point of view, but this is not a
constructive course of action. The
South African regime is not going to
be harmed by a lack ofpublicity.
NUS Feature
This week's main feature is a
condensed version of reports written
by Chris Martin and Bill Goodwin,
who attended the NUS conference
last month on behalf of the ICU
External Affairs Committee. In the
last few years there has been some
debate within the Union over whether
or not to send observers to these
conferences. I recommend that you
take time to read what they have
written. Few of us at this College
know a great deal about the workings
of the NUS. Too many of those who
fervently support one side or the other
base their opinions on third hand
information. Chris and Bill have both
reported their impressions of the
conference honestly and accurately,
and either of them will be happy to
pass on copies of their full-length
reports to anyone who is interested in
the NUS. They can both be contacted
via the FELIX Office.
EGM and JCR
Today at 12.30 pm there will be an
'Extraordinary General Meeting' of
ICU in the JCR where the Union's
response to the College'splansfor the
refectory reorganisation will
(hopefully) be decided. Despite a
series of prominent news items in
FELIX it seems that most students
are still oblivious to the controversy
which has arisen since the switch of
the JCR and the Main Dining Hall
was halted. Jackie has written at
length about the issue on page 4, and
has given a useful summary of "the
story so far." It may be that the
meeting will decide that the situation
as it stands is the most desirable.
Whatever the outcome it is
imperative that the Union officers
should have, and be seen to have, the
support of the student body on this
issue. If you vnfue your Union please
make every effort to turn up to
today's meeting.
ICredits
Yet again this is a much thinner issue
than I would have hoped to produce.
This week we have had only two days
to prepare FELIX since Monday and
Tuesday were taken up with a
training course on our new typesetter.
On Wednesday morning, after as
much copy aspossible hadbeen keyed
into the new machine the previous
evening, the power unitfailed and we
had to revert to using the old model.
Yesterday afternoon FELIX printer
Steve Shackell had to collect a box of
platesfrom Kings Cross Station after
the Print Unit ran out and our regular
suppliers did not have them in stock.
In short, it's been much the same as
usual. Particular thanks, therefore, to
Judith Hackney, Chris Martin, Chris
Edwards, "he whose name I cannot
mention", Nigel Whitfield andPippa
Salmonfor bailing me out once again.
Thanks also to Kamala Sen, Dave
Burns, Bill Goodwin, Gail Turner,
Neil Mottram, Sundi, Liz Holford,
Alex McNeil, RichardBleasdale, Pete
Wilson, Adrain Johnson, Jackie
Peirce, Steve Shackell and Rose
Atkins.
