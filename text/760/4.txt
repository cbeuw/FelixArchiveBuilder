Sabbaticals FELIX, Friday January 23rd 1987 4
JCR-to be or not to be?
D e p u t y President J a c k i e Peirce puts the U n i o n ' s view
forward o n the fight for the J C R .
IC Union By-Laws state "The
Governing Body has set aside, free of
rent, certain rooms for the use of the
Union, including "Junior Common
Room—Sherfield Building (during
term time)".
How is it then that Junior
Common Room (JCR) has
apparently, and without consent,
become part of the College refectory
system? Two years ago ambitious
plans to revitalise the catering in the
Sherfield Building were hatched.
These centred around the relocation
of all the catering facilities on level 2.
This required the swopping of the
JCR with the Main Dining Hall
(MDH).
On level 2 the main theme would
be a large food hall, roughly where
the Buttery is, but stretching into the
Senior Common Room/Senior
Dining Room (SCR/SDR). This
would serve students and staff, and
would have seating areas in the
present SCR and JCR. In one
corner of the JCR a take-away
burger bar, "QT", would be built.
Downstairs the new JCR would be
formed.
The agreement was made. All
conversion work would be carried
out so that both areas would be
ready simultaneously. A number of
problems were identified; the new
JCR would be smaller, conference
bookings would be affected,
meaning a slight reduction in the
Union's income (we get an average
of £12K a year from conference
bookings).
Then things started going wrong.
On November 15 1985 the then
Union President, Carl Burgess, was
forced to write to the College
Secretary stating that unless the
completion of both areas was
simultaneous, the deal was off. Yet
over Summer 1986 the only work
carried out was some refurbishment
in the SCR; in the JCR the bar was
moved and QT was built in its place,
and a new bar put on level 1.
"QT' opened for the first time
just before the start of the autumn
term this year. Almost immediately
it was a great success. Trade was
soon at levels predicted in the final
targets for next year. Then
somebody noticed " Q T ' wasn't a
take-away after all. If you stuck it in
a room full of seats, people sat in
them to eat their burgers! All further
plans were halted whilst College
went away to decide that, actually it
really wanted the Main Dining Hall
and the Junior Common Room for
refectories.
The plan then became M D H on
level 1 and on level 2, "QT" would
have half of the JCR, only the
Buttery would be turned into a mini
food hall serving into the SCR and
JCR.
At this stage we found that no
food hall would serve into the JCR.
Which meant everyone, including
students, would be going into the
SCR, ergo JCR. The academic staff
protested loudly, with the result
that, if their members' poll agrees,
the SCR will not only be restored
but enlarged and refined.
So now we are at the stage where
(possibly!);
1) QT gets half of the JCR during
every day.
2) The staff SCR expands into the
Buttery and gets revamped.
3) The Main Dining Hall stays
where it is, with the addition of grill
and salad bars.
4) The Conference Office loses
more space, we lose more money.
5) The student body gets...new
ceiling tiles! and loses effective
control of its largest room.
(Are you following this?)
On the lost income, College has
said that can be made up in
increased subvention but booking
charges are expected to rise by 10%
next year. Will that be mirrored in
increased subvention? And already
we have lost around £2K in 1986
and will certainly lose more in 1987.
But income, however desperately
needed, is not the main issue. We
have been losing space left,rightand
centre and now we are losing the
JCR. It has even been threatened
that, if we block these plans, we will
lose the Southside Gym instead!
In an effort to halt this, a proposal
was put to College that the outlets in
the JCR became student controlled.
The answer was no handing over of
QT, no handing over of the bar, no
say in when either should be opened
or closed. And the reason: students
obviously like things just the way
they are, they are voting with their
feet. Over 2000 transactions a day is
saying this is the right solution.
Jackie
President's
Piece
Sorry this is so short—this seems to
be the busiest week since the start
of October. Just a couple of
things...
Junior Common Room—yet again
Please, please, please come to the
Extraordinarily Exciting General
Meeting this lunchtime, 12.30 in
the JCR. It's absolutely necessary
that Jackie, Dave and I have a firm
mandate on what action we ought
to be taking over our Common
Room. Come and tell us what to
do.
U L U Day of Action
Next Tuesday, 27th January, is the
Day of Action over the proposed
50% cut to U L U . Please watch out
for more details—read the leaflets,
sign the petitions and take part in
any last-minute actions that may be
taking place!
Lesbian and Gay Rights
Last Monday Council co-opted
Robert Daniels to look into ways in
which the Union can improve
lesbian and gay rights and welfare,
and to provide a contact for any
lesbian, gay—or other—students
with problems or relevant
suggestions. You can contact
Robert via the Union office. If
you've any comments or queries
about the Union's plans or views
on the subject, or about Council's
decision, I suggest that you come
and see me—as I proposed co-
opting Robert in the first place, and
will be working with him.
Christine
Gay or
Lesbian?
Last Monday, ICU Council co-
opted me (Robert Daniel) onto
Council, the I C U Welfare
Committee and the College Welfare
Committee. My position is to
investigate how best the interests of
lesbians arid gays at IC can be served
by the Union. The Council co-opted
me because I first put the suggestion
to Christine Taig. We decided on 6
areas requiring attention:—
1. The homophobic atmosphere at
College.
2. Provision of lesbian and gay
social events.
3. Provision of advice and
information for lesbian and gay
students.
4. Representation of lesbians and
gays on issues within College.
5. Liaison with other lesbian and
gay organisations.
6. Provision of long term
commitment to lesbian and gay
rights.
Having stuck my neck out this far
I have decided to set up a Lesbian
and Gay Society which I hope will
be well attended. Perhaps this way I
will also gain other peoples views on
the matter. Keep an eye out for
posters detailing the launch of the
Society, hopefully early next week.
I would also greatly value letters
from lesbians and gays (in total
confidence) with any suggestions
about things they feel need to be
done, and all offers of help would be
greatly appreciated. I can be
contacted at the Union Office by
internal mail—either addressed to
me personally or to Lesbian/Gay
Welfare.
Lastly there will be a
questionnaire circulating College
sometime soon, and apparently one
question will be on sexuality. Since
these questionnaires will be the most
comprehensive recent survey of the
College population it would be very
good if an accurate figure could be
put on the number of homosexuals
at IC. My estimate (based on
national statistics) is 500. If you are
a lesbian or gay student make sure
you get counted becuase this will
help identify how great the need for
a Union Officer is.
