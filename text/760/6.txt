Featura FELIX, Friday January 23rd 1987
The conference was split into
'sessions' of about 4 hours each,
starting on Friday afternoon, and
finishing Monday morning; there
were nine sessions in total. Six of the
sessions were 'conference sessions'
with the delegates gathered together
in the main hall, two were 'sector
meetings' (the three sectors being
Universities, Public Sector Higher
Education (Polytechnics), and
Futher Education). The remaining
session was taken up with
'commissions' workshops where
delegates were given a chance to
question members of the National
Executive.
The conference began with the
National President, Vicky Phillips'
opening remarks. She outlined a
plan for the restructuring of the
NUS. She argued that the
conference was getting too large and
taking up too much of the time of
the NUS, and it was time a study
was undertaken in the way the NUS
works, how all the sectors fit
together within the NUS and so on.
She defended the No-Platform
camapaign for racists and facists,
held by many student unions and
the NUS itself, but warned of the
dangers of extending it any further,
to "anybody we don't agree with" as
she put it.
Throughout the conference
individual delegates regularly
suspended 'standing orders' (the
rules by which the conference is run)
in order to make some point to the
rest of the assembly. The issues
raised included vegetarian meals at
the hotel and students rioting in
France; to do this a delegate needed
50 other delegates in support, and,
initially anyway, it seemed that 50
delegetes could be found to support
almost anything. Such interuptions
occurred so frequently that it
seriously hindered the running of
the conference and resulted in many
delays and the loss of various items
off the agenda. This was very
definitely a case of too much
democracy, and this was a theme all
the way through the conference. The
chairing of the meetings left a little
to be desired—it was not until the
Imperial at NUS
Imperial College Union left the National Union of Students nearly ten years ago. At the
time the NUS was under fire for being undemocratic, expensive, and too concerned with
party politics. Last term Chris Martin and Bill Goodwin attended the NUS winter
conference as observers. Here we present an edited version of their reports of the
conference.
last session that a 'strong' chair took
over and cleared a lot of business
out of the way.
The Friday evening session had
timetabled some of the important
motions on 'Housing', 'Student
Financial Support' and 'Grants,
Benefits and Housing'. This rather
odd situation of having three
motions on related subjects was due
to a difference of emphasis in the
NUS between the 'soft-left', NOLS
(the National Organisation of
Labour Students), and the 'hard
left',SSIN (Socialist Students in
NOLS).
Firstly, however, a seemingly
innocent constitutional change
carried over from the afternoon
session caused a major row. The
change was about the number of
part time students that are
equivalent to a full-time student,
when calculating how many
delegates to conference a College
should have (currently 1 delegate
per 1,000 'full time equivalent'
students). The change would
decrease the number of part-time
students that made up one full-time
student from 10 to 5, thus
benefitting the Further Education
Colleges within the NUS who have a
large proportion of part-time
students. This was opposed by the
National Executive, as it would
make the conference bigger and
more expensive.
Then the fun started. They had a
vote, and then a count. The motion
was not passed by the two-thirds
majority it needed, but only missed
it by a slender margin. There was a
request for a re-vote, which was not
in the constitution, and then there
were indicative rulings, a
Presidential Ruling, votes about
votes etc etc. In the end, about an
hour later, they decided to have
another vote, this time on paper,
which defeated the change by a
larger margin. Again this was a case
for too much democracy—if the
NUS had stuck to its own rules, the
problem would not have arisen.
Some delegates were allowed to get
away with breaking some the rules,
and the result was chaos.
A short way into the debate we
unfortunately had to leave the
conference; as IC Union was only
partly subsidising the trip we had to
leave in order to travel to some
cheap accommodation some
distance away from the conference.
This was a definite nuisance and we
missed parts of several debates as
conference went on . From what I
could gather afterwards from
talking to other delegates, the
'moderate' motions about opposing
the 'Fowler Review', cutting
Housing Benefit and other Housing
support for students, was passed,
and the 'Loony Left' ideas like, for
example, nationalising land
ownership, were thown out. There
was a strong feeling that any
campaigns should not only be based
around Higher Education
(Universities and Polytechnics), but
should bring attention to the
problems faced by further education
students as well. The motion as
passed calls for a 'Major Housing
Campaign'.
Saturday saw the University
Sector meetings and workshops. I
attended a workshop on student
union autonomy in Universies, and
came across some real horror
stories—the Vice Chancellor at
Reading, we were told, was trying to
get a member of the University staff
into the Union to control any money
the Union paid out. The National
Executive were asked to prepare a
'defend your union' pack to collect
together the individual experiences
of student unions around the
country to circulate to other
Colleges if they are faced with
similar problems.
Sunday saw the 'commissions'
where delegates had a chance to
question members of the National
Executive, and from the ones that I
attended, they had a hard time of it.
The "finace and services"
commission discussed the NUS's
annual accounts; they have a large
problem in that the amount they
budgetted for telephone and travel
for their part-time executive
members has been exceeded by a
considerable amount because these
members have been doing far more
work than they used to in the past,
this was part of the reason why they
undertook to investigate the
structure of the NUS.
Elections took place on the
Sunday afternoon to the NUS
Elections Committee, Steering
Committee (which looks after the
organisation of the conferences, etc)
and a few others. During this a
candidate stood up and used his
election speech to put forward the
Federation of Conservative
Students' (FCS) position on the
NUS. He was heckled by the floor,
and judging by the reputation of
NUS conferences, this was not
suprising. What was suprising was
the number of delegates who
immediately afterwards stood up
and defended the candidate's right
to have his say the same as everyone
else. The hecklers was very definitely
in the minority.
Feature FELIX, Friday January 23rd 1987 7
Monday saw 4 hours left to get
through nearly half the business of
the conference, due to all the time
lost becuase of debates overrunning
and various interuptions. First on
the agenda was a debate on
economic policy—criticising
Government policy and the effect it
was having on students, making the
point very strongly that education
was not an issue that can be taken in
isolation. The depth the debate
reached, even in the short time
allocated to it, indicated that the
NUS were not just interested in
'more money for students', but
realised that a national organisation
campaigning for students must have
a longer term view and a deeper
understanding of the economics and
politics of government. To suggest
that a debate on economic policy is
not relevent to a body representing
the interests of 1.4m students
nationwide in further and higher
education, especially since it is the
economic policies of the present
government that are doing so much
damage to the education system, is
just not realistic.
By the end of the conference a
great deal of useful work had been
done, but there could of been more
if delegates hadn't been to quick to
interupt. If you set up the
democratic structures to allow every
delegate to take part in a conference
then they are all going to want to
take part in that conference. I am
sure the NUS realise this as well, and
it must be part of the reason why
they are moving to restructure the
conference. As the NUS has grown
to represent more and more
students, the number of delegates
has grown. There is always going to
be a dilemma between the
democratic right of the members to
take part in the running of the union
on one hand, and the cost, in terms
of time and money, of them doing
this. The NUS have rightly realised
that it is time that they had a re-
think about their conferences.
Chris Martin
BILL GOODWIN
The NUS decides its policy at two
national conferences. Delegates
from the constituent universities
and polytechnics are elected by
campus—wide ballot to vote on
behalf of the students they
represent. Imperial College Union
External Affairs Committee decided
to send myself and Chris Martin to
the 1986 winter conference as
observers.
The most significant motion was
that of Grants, Benefits and
Housing, on the policy document
'The Fowler review on Social
Security', which precludes students
from claiming during holiday
periods and which was criticised
because it would reduce access to
higher education. The Baker review,
which calls for the implementation
of student loans, was also
condemned, and the NUS claim for
a £35 weekly grant for all students in
further education was reaffirmed.
The motion on AIDS resolved to
give support to the Trevor Higgins
trust, which is researching the
disease, and to undertake an
educational programme designed to
remove the 'gay disease' prejudice
and to promote 'safe sex'. The
policy also seeks to ensure that
students and staff suffering from
A I D S or possessing A I D S
antibodies should be free to
continue their work as normal, and
that confidential treatment should
be provided.
My initial impressions were that
the organisation of the conference
was very good indeed—surpassing
GUC (University of London) and
ICU's UGMs by a long way.
Unfortunately, as the conference
progressed, a huge proportion of the
conference was wasted by delegates
suspending standing orders at every
opportunity. This facility allowed
delegates, with the approval of 50
members of conference, to halt the
proceedings in order, for example,
to make speeches or have indirective
votes in support of their pet issues.
Although many of the issues raised
were important, the facility was
consistantly abused by delegates
persuing the course of one-
upmanship. As a result there was no
time to hear the guest speakers, or to
consider emergency motions on
subjects such as US involvement in
Nicaragua, cuts in art courses,
Barclays' continuing interests in
South Africa, or to debate the
Executive's reports. I was
disappointed at the way major
motions had to be rushed through
without adequate debate. It was
difficult to see how democracy
could operate in a situation which
did not give delegates time fully to
understand what they were voting
on. I was not surprised when one
delegate, almost in tears, told the
conference that she didn't have a
clue what was going on; she was
given a sympathetic round of
applause by the conference.
I was disappointed, given the
conference's support for 'oppressed
minorities', that delegates should
choose to heckle the few speakers
who admitted to being members of
the Federation of Conservative
Students.
In conclusion, there is much
which could be done to improve the
effectiveness of NUS conferences; in
a sense the NUS is too democratic
for its own good. Whether the
situation will be improved by the
much—publicised restructuring
remains to be seen.
Is the NUS worth joining? I think
there is a definite need for a national
student organisation. It has to be
asked, though, whether the NUS has
lost its way?
CHRIS MARTIN
The NUS is making great efforts to
represent all the students in this
country; not just the university and
polytechnic students, but all those in
Further Education Colleges as well.
This is only right, especially since a
lot of these students are great deal
worse off than university students.
Suggesting that there should be
seperate national unions for each of
the different sectors is like
suggesting that there should be a
seperate union for rich and poor
students. Splitting the student
campaigning can only be a bad
thing, and can weaken the overall
position of student representation.
One thing you may have expected
in this report is accounts of political
in-fighting within the 'left' groups at
the conference. In fact, on the
conference floor, there was very
little. The arguments and debates
seemed to centre around issues, and
not dogma. Outside the conference
hall, however, there were as many
political groups all lined up and
trying to give you a bit of paper. The
absence of party-political slanging
matches on the floor of the
conference was suprising, as it was
not what I had been led to expect. Of
course political manouverings
happened behind the scenes, but the
issues themselves, it seemed, were
primary on the conference floor.
Should IC join the NUS?
Most of the people I talked to at
the conference seemed amazed that
a College the size of Imperial could
get by without the NUS. There was
no shortage of criticism of the NUS
at the conference, indeed delegates
seemed to revel in it, but in spite of
this, I did not hear one delegate or
College mention that they were
thinking about disaffiliating. The
few disaffiliation ballots that have
taken place recently have all
overwhelmingly supported the
NUS. I never cease to be amazed by
the 'knee-jerk' anti-NUS reaction of
some students, who while knowing
next to nothing about the NUS,
criticise it only because that is what
the previous year did. Since I have
been at College, there has been a
complete lack of reasoned factual
debate about the NUS; students
here, apparently, appear to rely on
the prejudices.
I am not going to get into the
arguments about why IC should be
in the NUS; all I will ask is this—Is
the NUS is so bad, why is, almost
without exception, every other
student and Student Union in this
country in the NUS, and Imperial
outside?
