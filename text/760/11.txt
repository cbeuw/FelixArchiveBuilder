Goosen for the gander
Tuesday's meeting of the
Conservative Society was cancelled
at the last minute. Mr Peter Goosen,
the Third Secretary at the South
African Embassy, was unable to
attend, as he had food poisoning.
Despite this, and the apparent
secrecy surrounding the visit, a
sizeable number of protestors
turned up outside room 139 in the
Huxley Building.
Dave B u r b a g e , C o n S o c
Chairman, said that there had been
the usual amount of publicity for the
event, but the Union Office and
College Security were not aware of
the talk until the FELIX Office
phoned them for comment.
FELIX visited Mr Goosen at
South Africa House on Wednesday,
where he said that he is still very
willing to come and talk. Mr
Goosen asserted that there is a
"large amount of confusion"
among South" Africans as to why
international pressure on their
country is increasing now, when the
pace of reform is also quickening,
London colleges have announced a
campaign to protest against the
Government's policy on Grants,
Benefits and Housing (GBH). The
two week campaign which is
planned to begin on February 9th is
designed to increase the public's
awareness of the issues. It will
feature leafleting, picketing, campus
occupation and a major march.
A spokesman for the IC
delegation to the G B H Committee
said the meeting had been very
useful, and added that IC Union
should stage a 24 hour work-in to
support the campaign.
and told F E L I X that the
Government is committed to the
abolition of Apartheid, free
government and a universal
franchise. On the subject of the
creation of a "New South Africa",
he said "We feel the ball is very
firmly in the court of the radical
groups in South Africa". He
claimed that all that is needed to
bring about the creation of the new
state is negotiation, and the
National Statutary Council Bill,
currently going through the South
African Parliament, provides for a
forum for these negotiations, which
will decide the form of the new
Government.
Saying that South Africa admits
the mistakes of the past, Mr.
Goosen told FELIX that " A l l
people should look to the future of
South Africa" and said that all that
needs to be done before negotiations
can begin is for the "terrorist"
groups to renounce violence. There
is nothing, he claimed, to prevent
the first steps occuring tomorrow.
Residents of Beit Hall were shocked
at the appearance of scaffolding
reaching to the roof of the Old
Hostel on Tuesday. Students were
not warned about the scaffolding,
which has been built so that some of
the baths can be replaced with
showers. Dr John Finley, who has
been the WaFden of Beit for just
over a year, explained that he was
only informed that the work would
go ahead at the beginning of the
week. It was supposed to have
happened before he took up the
post, he added.
When asked about the security
One of the major forces for
reform is considered by the South
African Government to be the
g r o w i n g economy, w h i c h
necessitates employment of all races
if enough labour is to be found, and
Mr Goosen said that sanctions
would slow down the pace of
reform, especially in cost-intensive
areas such as housing; a housing
shortage means that there has been
little visible effect. About half of the
black population in South Africa is
under fifteen years old, and it is
estimated that one million homes
are needed now, as well as the jobs
and other facilities that will be
needed when these people reach
adulthood. Mr Goosen stressed to
FELIX that change will take place
"as soon as humanely possible," but
pointed out that the imposition of
sanctions will, in the view of the
South African Government, make
the funds necessary for such reform
virtually unobtainable.
On the African National
Congress, Mr Goosen said "We
implications, especially for those
bedrooms which are accessible from
the scaffolding, Dr Finley admitted,
"Beit Hall has virtually no
security," and said he did not think
this would change until students
were persuaded to close the doors
and so on. A sensible thief would use
the front door rather than the
scaffolding, he suggested.
don't deny that the ANC was for
many years a peaceful organis-
ation", and that it does represent a
certain portion of the views of black
South Africans, but he also pointed
out that the leaders of the ANC have
publicly condoned the practice of
'necklacing', whereby a rubber tyre
filled with petrol is placed around
the neck of the victim, and then set
alight, and outlined in graphic detail
how death occurs. The continuing
violence of the A N C - nineteen
people were killed by a single car
bomb in 1983 - and of the other, less
well known, organisations, is seen as
the obstacle to negotiation.
Mr Goosen's view was that the
terrorist should leave his gun
outside, rather than bring it in to the
conference room with him.
In closing he told FELIX that he
would be willing to come and field
questions from anti-apartheid,
supporters, and said that he 'would
be over like a shot' as soon as a date
could be arranged.
