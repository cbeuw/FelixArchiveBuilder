Film
Society
IC Film Soc's next presentation,
this Thursday 29th in Physics LT1
(doors 7.30pm) is Beverly Hills Cop
starring the one and only Eddie
Murphy.
Eddie Murphy plays a very
unconventional wise-cracking cop.
His best friend comes to visit him
and within a couple of hours is
gunned down by hit men. Murphy
goes to Beverly Hills to track down
his friend's killers, and that's where
the fun starts.
The comedy is fast and furious
and Eddie Murphy will make you
believe he could talk his way out of
a room with no doors.
If you've seen 48 Hours or
Trading Places you can't miss
Eddie Murphy's best movie to date,
Beverly Hills Cop.
Just booked-films include
Cocoon, Hitcher, Fright Night and
The Sword in the Stone.
50p members, £1.00 non-
members.

Real Ale
We have a special meeting today
(Friday 23rd) with the head brewer
from Gales Brewery coming to
speak, and of course Gales beer.
The meeting will be in the Lounge
(Ground Floor, L H S Union

warmer than our usual venue! See
you there for 7.00pm.

Winter nets have started at Lords
Cricket Ground on Tuesday nights
from 9-10pm. Sign up in the third

Micro Club
If you think that computing is just
hour-long debugging sessions or
the high score on Space Invaders
then Micro Club have organised

your mind and prise you from the
keyboards:

Simulators — Thursday 12th
February.
(ii) A talk by Sir Clive Sinclair —
Thursday 26th February.

by INMOS — Tuesday 3rd March.

QT
Having succeeded in bringing last
week's U G M to a halt with a
carefully concealed telephone, QT
Soc is now embarking on its
ultimate plan to take over Imperial
College. An Extremely Extra-
ordinary General Meeting will be
held on Thursday at 1pm to discuss
our presidential campaign. Our
candidate, Alky Jim of Alcoholics
Anonymous, is raring to go! The
campaign will be worked out in
detail on Thursday. We need as
many members as possible to turn
up, particularly anyone with good
ideas, and anyone interested in
producing posters and canvassing.
Abortion
Olivia Gans, Director of American
Victims of Abortion, has agreed to
come to Britain for the 1987 SPUC
Students' Division Lecture Tour.
IC PATA have arranged that the
meeting for Central London takes
place at Imperial College, Lecture
Theatre 213 in the Huxley
Building, at 7.30pm on Monday
26th January. Olivia has had an
abortion herself and will be talking
not only of her own experience, but
also of recent research on post-
abortion syndrome. The lecture is
open to all students.
Soc Soc
We are still active this term with
meetings every Tuesday (unless
there is a speaker meeting) in the
Green Committee Room at
12.45pm (Top floor, Union
Building).
We have Tony Benn coming on
February 16th in the Great Hall.
Also former broadcaster Austin
Mitchell at a date to be arranged
this term.
Anti Apartheid
Thank you to the many people who
turned up outside the planned
Consoc talk on Tuesday.
Unfortunately the representative of
the South African Embassy did not
turn up due to 'food poisoning'.
Anybody with a conspiracy theory
about this should keep their ear to
the ground; Consoc are trying to
arrange another date for the talk to
go ahead.
BUN AC
It is now that time of year, with the
wind blowing its strongest and the
temperatures low enough to keep
brass monkeys indoors, when all
the big holiday firms begin to tempt
us with brochures full of sun-kissed
beaches and cities offering all
imaginable forms of pleasure.
Unfortunately for most students
these holidays are not priced with
the dwindling grant in mind.
There is, however, an
a l t e r n a t i v e . The B r i t i s h
Universities North American Club
(BUNAC) was formed to assist
students who would like to visit the
United States but would otherwise
be unable. BUNAC offers three
schemes to help finance that once
in a lifetime trip:
Work America: You are provided
with a directory of employers who
have taken on students in the past.
You write to the one you fancy and
if you are accepted BUNAC will
then assist you in getting a
temporary work visa, which is
essential and can only be obtained
through us. Alternatively if you
know someone over there who will
act as a sponsor you can go without
a job offer.
BUNACAMP: Your chance to
spend the summer looking after
young Americans. A l l interviews
for this scheme are carried out in
England by BUNAC.
KAMP: For those who don't
warm to the idea of spending their
time with the kids but would like to
work on a summer camp this is the
one for you. The camps are situated
in some of the most beautiful
surroundings imaginable and you
would usually have access to all the
facilities.
BUNAC is a non-profit making
organisation fully endorsed by the
American authorities and has
offices in the States to assist anyone
in need.
For more details see us in the
JCR at 12.45pm most Thursdays.
SPORTS
Ski
The 1st and 2nd ski teams hit the
slush last Saturday, to demonstrate
the slalom prowess recently
acquired on the Tignes pistes. The
influence of the New Year trip was
evident, with the 2nd team being
dragged from the bar to compete in
their events. (They slid happily into
last place).
Unable to make 'the double' the
1st team came 2nd overall,
narrowly thrashed by St. Thomas'
Hospital. Cheers folks! Next race
22nd February. For future events
come to our Thursday meetings.
