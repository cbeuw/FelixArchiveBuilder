Keys resolved
New system
for Linstead
It was announced at Student
Residence C o m m i t t e e on
Wednesday that a new key system is
to be installed in Linstead Hall.
College's 'Davidson Committee'
working party said that the new
arrangements will involve having
two locks on each door. The used
during the term will be a high
quality Assa system, which will be
put out of action when the rooms
are let in the vacation and the
cheaper locks used. The changeover
will take two or. three keys and is
intended to improve the security of
the Assa keys. Welfare Officer, Tom
Meliar-Smith estimated' that the
locks will be installed by the summer
term.
The new locks will be
accompanied with better key
security in general. Even the
subwardens and warden will no
longer hold master keys, although
the warden will have access to one.
Another change will be that
students who lose keys will have to
pay Â£45 for a new lock rather than
paying for a new key as at present.
Despite the greatly increased cost,
the decision was welcomed by
student members Ian Howgate and
M r Meliar-smith, who have
campaigned strongly for increased
security.

Angry residents have presented a
petition to College Secretary John
Smith, complaining about the lack
of water and heating in Weeks
Hall. The residents have been
without water between 10am and
12pm since January 15th.
The problem is due to burst pipes
causing a reduction in pressure and
the lack of a pump to supply water
to the storage tank. This has been
aggravated by the recent
installation of water meters of the
wrong size, which constrict the
flow. Showers, sinks and toilets are
currently unusable -and students
have been forced to obtain water
from fire hoses and to take showers
in the sports centre or very late at
night.
Student Accomodation Officer
Lesley Gillingham told FELIX
"The situation to the students
involved is totally deplorable and
we hope it will be resolved as
quickly as possible".

The Student Residences Committee
finally decided on the future of
Tizard and Selkirk Halls' kitchens
on Wednesday. A small-scale survey
of the residents of these Halls
produced a majority in favour of
gallery-level kitchens with fridges in
cupboards on staircases, and this
scheme, which was favoured by the
wardens, was accepted without
further argument.

MPs attack Government
A Parliamentary select committee
has called for a significant increase
in student grants. A report last week
by the committee accused the
Department of Education and
Science of giving misleading
information about the grants
situation and critisised it for failing
to research student costs.
Whilst the committee did not
discuss student loans, it decided that
some form of award system is
essential to national needs. The
report calls for a decrease in
parental contributions and
provision for student welfare
benefits.
The MPs, chaired by William Van
Straubenzee, attacked the DES for
giving misleading information
about student' maintenance costs.
As recently as 1981 the Department
had stated that grants were based on
an objective assessment of costs
which was not the case. There is no
research unit in the DES to monitor
student costs and information
appears to come from parties with a
vested interest.
Harry Greenway, Conservative
MP, said "it is extraordinary that
they do not have a research
department. They are always about
three years out of date."
It is not certain what effect the
select committee's report will have
upon the grant settlement for next
academic year or upon the
Government's own enquiry whose
chairman, Junior Education
Minister, George Walden, is
presently in the United States,
examining its system of student
support. It does appear to be part of
a move towards a more favourable
attitude amongst the Government
towards student claims of hardship.
Red faces in College
It was red faces all round in College
Security after they installed a high
security metal gate to protect the
Nat West Bank. The ASSA lock
with which they chose to secure the
gate has a latch device on the inside
of the doors. Unfortunately the gap
between the bars is wide enough for
a hand to reach round and open the
door.
When FELIX pointed this out to
College Security Chief, Geoff
Reeves, he announced his intention
to install a magnetic lock. He added
that a similar lock would be
installed on the door to the Quiet
Room in order to protect the
Holland Club. A further security
Screen is to be installed in the Gents
toilets which also provides access to
the club.
Day of action
Most London colleges will be
taking part in the U L U Day of
Action next Tuesday. The
campaign "Defend the three R's" is
against the proposed 50% cut in
central funding.
Much of the action will be
centered on the central precinct in
Bloomsbury, with the smaller
colleges joining forces with the
Trade Unions. A picket of the
.Central Services will be mounted
from 11.30 am until 2.30 pm.
University College are to picket
all their entrances, and John Pope,
U L U Sports President will run to as
many colleges as possible during
the day.
In the U L U Building itself a
meeting will be held at 1.00 pm to
discuss plans for the rest of the day,
and there will be a free disco in the
evening with specially mixed "50%
cuts cocktails."
