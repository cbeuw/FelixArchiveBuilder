Rag Conference 1987
From 6th-9th January, four of us from
Imperial Rag descended on
Loughborough, scene of this year's
Rag Conference, where we collected
ideas and information on how to run
Rag more efficiently and enjoyably.
The conference consisted of sessions
during the day and social events in the
evening, and the thirty-five Rags
represented participated en-
thusiastically (sometimes over-
enthusiastically) in both. Man Tai was
made to attend the discussion on ef-
fective committee work, and Nigel
Baker, Rag Treasurer, at last
discovered how to deal with VAT (ig-
nore it!) whilst Mike Copperwhite's
.favourite sessions seemed to be those
spent in the bar...
One of many guest speakers was
Vicky Phillips, who spoke on Rag's
relationship with the NUS, but since
Rag doesn't have any relations with
the NUS this wasn't a lot of use. NUS
was considered to be a political body
and the unanimous feeling was that
Rag should be apolitical, although the
subject of relations with individual
student unions provoked a more
heated discussion. We are obviously
lucky in that we clash very little with
ours.
A session on Rag Mags saw Im-
perial in the firing line for having a
mag with traditionally the sickest and
most offensive material, but a number
of delegates informed us that they still
considered our mag to be the most
original. Having read several other
Rag Mags (which seem very much
like one mag duplicated several times)
I must confess to agreeing with them,
been taken and more thought will go
into the content for next year's mag.
On the second evening we were
entertained by two very impressive
professional acts — Sally Barker and
Tom McEwan - who we're going to
try and book for IC in the near future.
Look out for them — they're well
worth seeing. In the Rag Revue on the
last night we were given the chance
to display our astounding thespian
skills, as well as getting drenched in
the ensuing water-fight.
All in all, we learnt a great deal
from the conference and if you want
to know more about it, or simply want
to take a more active role in Rag
yourself, then come along to the next
and whilst not condoning offensive
material, it has to be remembered that
our mag is not sold on the streets as
others are. However, the point has
meeting which will be advertised in
FELIX.

Retraction;
IC Tomb
Horror
Last week's FELIX carried a story
entitled "IC Tomb Horror" as one
of the back page news items. This
article was a spoof news story, and
"reported" the deaths of 3 students
in a Lexham Garden flat. Neither
the p o s i t i o n i n g n o r the
presentation of the article made it
clear that it was not a genuine news
story. I had originally planned to
include this in a humour section,
and to include a photograph which
would convey instantly the tone of
the article. Because of a lack of time
in the later stages of production,
the story appeared as straight news.
I accept that on first reading it was
not absolutely clear that the article
was not serious, and I apologise if
anyone was offended by its
inclusion.

More Groping
You may remember the argument
the infamous Groper family had a
while back about the garden at
Lurch mansion. Well, not contented
with living peaceably for a while,
they've come to blows again over
the orchard. After Grandma
Groper 'croaked' a few months
back there was much excitment over
who would get what from the old
bat's last will and testament. But,
being the grouchy old goat that she
A P
A P
was, she thought she'd leave a few
argument causing clauses, since she
knew exactly what reaction they'd
prevoke. The orchard was to be
devided equally between Mr. and
Mrs. Groper and the two brats,
simple enough you'd think,
especially as the orchard is square in
shape. The problem is that there are
four apple trees and four pear trees
in the orchard arranged as shown.
Of course each member of the
family insists on having one of each
type of tree in their share. Not only
that, but they also insist that the
orchard be devided between the four
of them so that each share has
exactly the same shape, as well as the
same area!
'Impossible' you say? That's what
evil Granny thought, but she was
mistaken. This week's problem is to
stop the plates flying at Lurch
mansion by showing how the
orchard can be devided up as
required. Answers, comments, new
problems..etc to me at the FELIX
office by 1.00pm Wednsday. £5
prize for a randomly selected
winner, as usual.
Barrel of beer - solution
Yes, you all guessed it (well most of
you anyway), the only way of
solving the problem is to empty the
barrel! Horror of horrors! But the
rules don't say where you have to to
pour the beer, and into the gullets of
the assembled crowd is perfectly
legal. Admittedly the people at the
stall weren't exactly pleased when
we suggested this , but we promised
to pay for the barrel if we didn't
complete the challenge. There are
several ways of doing it once you
realise that you have to empty
(drink) the barrel. Here's one of
them. Fill up the 5-pint; fill the 3-
pint from the 5-pint and drink the
contents of the 3-pint leaving two
pints; transfer these to the 3-pint;
refill the 5-pint, giving seven pints in
all. Now the fun part, drink the rest
of the barrel! Empty the seven pints
back into the barrel; fill the 3-pint
and emtpy it into the 5-pint; fill the
3-pint from the barrel again, leaving
one pint in the barrel; fill the 5-pint
from the 3-pint leaving one pint in
the 3-pint; drink the contents of the
5-pint and, finally, fill it from the
barrel leaving one pint in each glass.
Lots of correct solutions to this
one (I gave too many hints, I
suspect) out of which Steve Porter,
Comp 2, was selected as the £5 prize
winner, well done.
Pyramid problems - solution
This did cause a lot of problems.
Even with last week's clue I still only
got three correct answers. The
problem of finding the pyramid's
comparative volumes can easily be
solved if you can construct one from
the other. It happens that you can
construct a large tetrahedron from
four half-sized ones, and two half-
sized square pyramids, as shown
below.
The two square-base pyramids
are put base to base forming the
octahedron in the centre, with the
tetrahedra forming the corners. The
large pyramid shown has twice the
dimensions of the smaller ones and
thus eight times the volume. So we
get, simply, 4T + 2P = 8T, and thus
P = 2T.
It was pointed out in several
answers that it's also possible to
build a square based pyramid from 4
tetrahedra and 6 small, square based
pyramids, but as it's completely
impossible to draw I'll leave that as
a supplementary problem for the
rest of you! The winner was Simon
Hall, Physics 3, who I must say signs
his letters in the most intimate of
terms! Collect your£5 after Monday
lunchtime, please.
