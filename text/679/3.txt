Goodbye Maz!
Jack Nutbeem retires
Super-messenger Jack Nutbeen retired last week after 20
years at Imperial College.
Jack pictured above with Vi Lindfield, the telephonist
who has also retired, was a familiar sight all over the
College, and was well-liked by staff and students alike.
Maz Fellows, the FELIX
phototypesetter operator, is
leaving Union employment
after five years. Maz has
been responsible for type-
setting everything that goes
in FELIX, as well as many
other Union publications.
During her time here Maz has
worked for such notorious edit-
ors as Steve Marshall and Pallab
Ghosh, but despite this has main-
tained a cheerful disposition
throughout.
Maz has been a friend to every-
one who has used the F E L I X
Office in the last five years. She
has always answered the silliest
enquiries with her characteristic
patience, and has kept cool in the
direst of emergencies.
We at F E L I X wish Maz all the
best in her new job in Tooting.
She will be sorely missed.
Maz's leaving means that there
will be three new Union staff
starting this session. A new rec-
eptionist will be starting in Octo-
ber, and the new post of Catering
Supervisor has already been fil-
led. M r Norman Jardine will take
over responsibility for running
the new Union snack-bar outlet
next month.
Maz Fellows who leaves today.

1962-79
M r M J (Mickey) Davies C M G
O B E M A died on 8th July-
Born in 1918 in South Africa of
Welsh extraction he was
educated at the Diocesan
College, Cape Town, at the
University of Cape Town and, as
a Rhodes Scholar, Trinity
College, Oxford. He played
rugby football for the University
of Oxford, and for Wales in 1938
and 1939, always treasuring the
memory of his selection.
Appointed to the Colonial
Administrative Service in
Tanganyika in 1940, as an
Administrative Officer, he
quickly gained p r o m o t i o n ,
becoming Private Secretary to a
series of Governors from 1943 to
1947. From 1947 to 1949 he was
seconded to the Colonial Office
as one of the most able
administrative officers of his year
and in 1958 and 1959 was
Assistant Special Representative
for T a n g a n y i k a at t h e
Trusteeship Council of the
United Nations. In 1959 he was
made Minister for Constitutional
Affairs in Tanganyika, later
taking over the portfolio for
Security and Immigration at a
time of great political ferment
and popular agitation, while
being at the same time
responsible for the planning of a
major re-organisation and
expansion of the Police Force
which was then about to be
introduced. He was Minister for
Information Services until the
date of self-government on 1 May
1961, having for some months in
1960 been A c t i n g C h i e f
Secretary. His record was
distinguished and there was no
assignment in which he was not
outstandingly successful. He was
made an O B E in 1957 for his
work in the Arusha district. In
1961 he was awarded the
Medaille de la Belgique
Reconnaissante for services to
Belgian refugees and in the same
year he was made C M G for his
services as a Minister.
His s e c o n d c a r e e r i n
administration followed his
retirement from Her Majesty's
Overseas Civil Service when in
1962 he was appointed, from a
large field of candidates, to the
post of Secretary of the College
and Clerk to the Governors of
the Imperial College of Science
and Technology. It was a time of
major expansion and recon-
struction at the College taking
place under the leadership of the
Rector, Sir Patrick Linstead.
Only the Blackett Laboratory
had been completed and all but
one of the other buildings on the
site were under construction or
adaptation under the "Jubilee
S c h e m e " . M i c k e y D a v i e s
adapted quickly to the new
challenge, moulding a committee
structure and administrative
machinery to ensure effective
consultation, communication
and control in appropriate areas.
He steered the Administration
through the further expansion of
the "post-Robbins" period in the
mid-sixties, through a time of
student pressure for greater
participation in decision-making
processes which marked the late
60s and early 70s during the
Rectorship of Lord Penney, and
subsequently, until his decision
to retire in June 1979, serving the
present Rector, Lord Flowers. A
man of drive and dynamism,
analytical ability, conscien-
tiousness and good humour, he
played a pivotal role in the
development of the College,
while still devoting a full part of
himself to his family, his friends
and his hobbies. He was awarded
Honorary Fellowship in 1979.
Shortly before his departure
from the College he delivered a
valedictory lecture which he
closed by quoting from W H
Auden: "When Ifind myself in the
company of scientists Ifeel like a
shabby curate who has strayed
by mistake into a drawing room
full of dukes." He need never
have felt ashamed; many
scientists and engineers who
have been or are associated with
Imperial College will regret the
passing of Mickey Davies and
acknowledge their immense debt
to him as will the many others of
his former friends, colleagues,
and acquaintances.
He leaves a widow, Elizabeth,
and three children, Jennifer,
Philip, and Peter.
