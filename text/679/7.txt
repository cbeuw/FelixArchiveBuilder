Allen a schmuck
In Broadway Danny Rose (PG)
Woody Allen plays a theatrical
agent who gives a lot of advice.
One piece he leaves out is that
familiarity breeds contempt and
Allen is slowly but surely
approaching the point where the
two merge. Danny Rose is not a
bad film, just it has been released
rather abruptly after the over-
rated Zelig and is similarly short.
Again Allen casts Mia Farrow
opposite him but whereas she has
transformed brilliantly from the
erudite physician of Zelig to play
Tina, a restless peroxide moll,
Allen is basically playing the
same character (schmuck) again.
His megalomaniac approach
to film-making—he writes,
directs and has most of the
lines—is such that he neglects
such essentials as developing the
supporting cast and plot. The
screen-play has been noticeably
stretched, even at a meagre 85
minutes.
Allen meets Farrow through
his protege, lugubrious cabaret
star Lou Canova (also Farrow's
lover—a fine cameo by Nick
Apollo Forte) and a misunder-
standing involving these three,
Canova's wife and another of
Tina's men, a poet mafiosa leads
to much merriment and mayhem.
The two stars are being pursued
by two hit-men wielding baseball
bats (mindless rather than
menacing) whilst Lou drinks
himself silly prior to a showcase
gig at the Waldorf before
representaties of national
television and a Las Vegas night
spot.
Despite all this, beautiful black
and white photography, a novel
structure (a group of comics
telling Danny Rose stories),
Rose's exotic roster of acts and
the magnificent Mia Farrow, the
film still failed to move this
writer—strange, the couple
beside me laughed like drains.
Mia Farrow as Tina Vitale the
widow of a bumped off gangster in
the new comedy, 'Broadway
Danny Rose'.
Man has long been fascinated with the creation of automata that
mimic the form and actions of our species. A new exhibition at the
Victoria and Albert Museum's Boilerhouse Project attempts to cast a
historical and cultural perspective against the forthcoming era of
automation—dispelling commonly held myths by showing a range of
material from science fiction film clips to a modern industrial robot.
The star of the show is probably a mechanical android made by
McAndroids of Brixton, a partly mobile tailors dummy that shows
how far we have to go to achieve anything near human form or
movement for our machines. The exhibition is small and a little short
on content, but could make an interesting distraction if you care to
wander in from Exhibition Road one afternoon. Robots runs until 25
October.

Summer Singles
April Showers—Abandon
Ship
With a light "Everything But
The Girl" feel, Beatrice Colin,
a n d J o n a t h a n B e r n s t e i n
release their first single on
C h r y s a l i s , and quite an
a c h i e v e m e n t it is t o o .
' A b a n d o n S h i p ' has an
unobtrusive but memorable
melody, and words that
actually mean something! It
even has a great B-side 'Every
Time We Say Goodbye'. What
more could it need to be
successful—a ban from Mike
Read perhaps?
Tracey Ullman—Sunglasses
I guess it must be difficult to
find songs for a voice that can
only manage 3 notes, and it
looks like they've run out right
now. Although a certain chart
success, with probably a very
good (and very expensive)
video, this is really dreadful.
Bring back the Wombles!
Adventures—Another Silent
Day
This is more like it. A n
intriguing double vocal from
T e r r y S h a r p e & E i l e e n
Gribben, backed by a gospel
choir, gives it a feel quite
unlike anything I've ever
heard. A n d yet, when I play it,
my feet start tapping, and I
end up whistling the tune all
day. The best debut single I've
heard in a long time. Buy it!
The Colour Field—Take
As a longtime fan of the
Specials and Funboy 3, I
always look forward to Terry
Hall's singles, but this second
single from his new band, is
almost as disappointing asthe
first ( T h e C o l o u r f i e i d ' ) .
D e s p i t e a c l e v e r ' h o o k '
melody, and very deep,
pseudo Paul Welle/ lyrics, the
single cannot be considered
in the same league as songs
l i k e ' G h o s t T o w n ' o r
'Lunatics'. The B-side is the
classic 'Windmills of Your
Mind', reworked as a chart of
desparation, which works out
really well—but who buys a
single for a B-side?
Spandau Ballet — I'll Fly
For You
From the latest hit album
' P a r a d e ' , this has b e e n
considerably remixed, and the
12' at least, has 2 very different
versions. The vocal 'AA' side
has the distinctive Spandau
Feel, but the 'A' side Glide
Version is a real mood piece,
with loads of strings, and
whispered vocals. Whatever
your opinion of the Spandaus,
'Parade' is a classic album,
and this, one of the best tracks
from it. But then, it's not 'hip
to enjoy trendy bands likethis,
so you'll probably put it down
anyway.
