New Hall for Imperial?
Plans are being developed by the College to erect a new Hall
of Residence in Princes Gardens. It is expected that the hall
will house about 150 students, mainly postgraduate, in high
quality accommodation.
The College Secretary, John
Smith, has announced that an
architect has been engaged to
draw up plans for a building on
top of the present Sports Centre.
The proposed building would be
of the same depth and height as
Garden Hall and be designed to
be in keeping with the existing
b u i l d i n g s a r o u n d Princes
Gardens.
It has been suggested that the
study-bedrooms should be of a
higher quality than Southside
rooms; they may contain toilets
and showers en suite, or be
arranged on a flatlet basis.
This new scheme replaces
earlier plans by the Student
Residence Committee to buy an
existing building. N o suitable
premises could be found that
were cheap enough to become
self-financing after a reasonable
time. The proposed hall has the
advantage that it could be let
during the vacation under the
S u m m e r A c c o m m o d a t i o n
Scheme, in order to raise revenue
to offset the increased cost of
building over purchase of
existing premises.

Science Parksplannedfor
South Ken andSilwood
Imperial College is planning to develop research centres
designed to facilitate the transfer of technology to industry.
The centres will be based at Silwood Park and South
Kensington, and will be known as 'Science Parks'.
The scheme consists of small
units of between 500 and 10,000
square feet. These will be let to
industrial concerns who sponsor
research at IC, and who wish to
have representatives on site.
The major part of the
development will be at Silwood
Park, the College's field station
near Ascot. There is a five acre
site at Silwood containing
derelict war-time buildings which
is being considered for the siting
of units totalling 60,000 square
feet. The major attraction of the
Silwood site is the nuclear reactor
situated there. The units will also
be of interest to those industrial
concerns involved in environ-
mental research.
The other development will be
at South Kensington in the
vacant area adjacent to the Old
Chemistry building. Part of this
will house a small group from
Sinclair Research Ltd; the rest of
the building will comprise chiefly
small research and development
units. The plans may result in the
loss of about six car parking
spaces. The lawn which is the site
of the proposed extension to the
New Chemistry Building will not
be affected.
The College have engaged
Investors in Industry (31) pic to
conduct a feasibility study for
both sites. If plans do go ahead
then it is expected that 31 will
provide the necessary capital
outlay for the building work. The
College will act as landlord, and
will collect rent from letting the
units.
College Secretary John Smith
said that it was unlikely that the
scheme would raise a lot of
money directly in the short term.
Its advantage would be in making
the College more attractive to
firms sponsoring research.
Science Parks already exist at a
number of British Universities
including Leeds, Hull, Bradford
and, notably, Cambridge.
