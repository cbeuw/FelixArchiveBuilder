George sank further into the
corner, his hands clasped i n despair and
the sweat pouring from the furrows i n
his brow. Only the hammering of h i s
heart broke the ear/ silence. The
hideous black monster crept slowly
forward, i t s green eyes, unblinking,
fixed firmly on i t s victim and i t s red
claws quivering i n the moonlight.
Then suddenly i t struck
the claws sank into i t s cheeks
and the rasping tongue began to l i c k the
warm, sticky blood. At once there was
a v i v i d flash of lightening and a deaf-
ening burst of thunder.
George sat up suddenly. As
he d i d so, Tiddles, the marmalade oat
soamperod away through the bedroom and
the l a s t ohimes of the dying alarm
clook sounded i n h i s ears.
So ended another nightmare,
but don't turn away because I have an
interesting sequel. Although no person
i n h i s right senses beliey.aa i n blood-
sucking vampires to-day there i s i n
existence a more or less comparable
body of devoted souls who earn t h e i r
l i v i n g i n a similar sort of way. These
are the members of the National Blood
Transfusion Service and a unit from the
South London Centre w i l l be v i s i t i n g
this College again early i n November.
My reason f o r writing t h i s a r t i c l e i s to
ask you to take advantage of the unique
f a o i H t i e s which they offer and to enrol
as a Flood Donor, i f you have not already
done so. However, just i n case my
rather h o r r i f i c introduction has given
you some mi3saprehensions l e t me add a
few more facts. F i r s t l y the process i s
quite painless, any donor w i l l t e l l you
tills. ' After a few preliminary items
of red tape you take up your position
on the couch and present either vour
right or.your l e f t arm, whichever s u i t s
you best. The doctor then makes the
necessary insertions which at the most
oan be f e l t as a small pin p r i c k just
below the elbow joint. You then l a y i n
peace f o r about ten minutes, flexing the
muscles of your fore-arm to help the
c i r c u l a t i o n . When the doctor has r e -
moved the apparatus you transfer yourself
to another couch f o r a further ten min-
ute period a f t e r which you are at l i b e r t y
to claim a free cup of tea with b i s c u i t s .
What else do you gain besides
tea and b i s c u i t s ? The answer t o t h i s
question i s materially nothing; but.
you leave the h a l l r.vith a jOLowins inner
satisfaction that the 30 minutes of your
l i f e which you have 'just spent could so
easily mean 30 years to somebody else.
Therefore I would ask you t o think ser-
iously about enrolling and consider the
fact that the unit . . i l l \,e operating
"on your doorstep" a3 i t were... remem-
ber some donors t r a v e l several miles to
give their blood, la the meantime here
are a few details. If you want tc ,
enrol then you must be over 18 and under
65(eldexly students please note). Fur-
theremore.if you are under SI,you will
need the written permission of your

We hear that Kr.Kooney,our respect-

caused by an ex-miner who, as navigator,
thought that the best way to encircle

Mooney w i l l commemorate the event by
