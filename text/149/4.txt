A new year,a new set of freshers,and,
perhaps,a new s p i r i t i n the Union* Which
brings us to the E d i t o r i a l ,
It's an amazing; thing that ao many oome
and so few are seen more than once. When
we f i r s t came to this. college(many years
ago now),the combined effects of the spe-
eches that the Rector,the President of th
Union and several other people made,was
rather overwhelming and i t was some time
before we s e t t l e d down. Unfortunately,
too many of the freshers started o f f cm
the wrong foot by treating I.C.as some
sort of advanced cran school,where know-
ledge was obtained by purely mechanical
means. They didn't take advantage of the
enormous, number of clubs and s o c i e t i e s
(which,by the way,provide f a c i l i t i e s f o r
everything from rugby to underwater swim-
ming, from Marxism to Catholicism.),spent
t h e i r three years here without taking
any interest i n the Union,and disappeared,
half-educated,'into the larger f i e l d of
life,"uwept,unhonoured and unsung." This
s t i l l happens.
The main end,of oourse,of a University
eduoation i s the obtaining of a degree.
But t h i s i s by no means the only end, A
University must"claim,not only that i t i s
e n t i t l e d t o grant c e r t i f i c a t e s of academ-
i c standard,but also that i t ' s graduates
are of a oertain worth i n other f i e l d s
them the academic Those who l a y the onus
of student apathy on the college author-
i t i e s are,we feel,misdirected. Only the
individual can make the decision as t o
wether he s h a l l broaden h i s outlook or
narrow it,end no ammount of "culture"
w i l l force him to broaden i t i f he decides
otherwise. This point,we feel,needs s t r e s -
sing.
We appeal,therefore,to the freshers not
to allow themselves t o beoome technolog-
i c a l morons,but t o do something other
than academic work i n t h e i r spare time,
even i f i t ' s only w r i t i n g f o r F e l i x .
After that long homily,we would l i k e to
wish a l l the freshers the beat of luok and
happiness i n t h e i r college careers,may
you pass the exams and may you never be
sorry that you came toI.C.

Dear S i r ,
I am disturbed to learn
that"there i s to be a new cloak-
room system. Why were the Union mem-
bers not consulted about this? Under
this new system,imposed by Council
i n their usual d i c t a t o r i a l manner,
- a l l the items w i l l have to be handed
i n through one hatch,and withdrawn from
another
Under the old system sev-
eral people could hand i n their nnats
over the oounter at onoe.and b r i e f -
cases could be l e f t i n the.cloakroom
without resort to tickets or atten-
dants. Under the new system,anyone
handing i n coat,hat,brown-bagorbrolly,
w i l l have to stand i n a long queue,
probably reaching out into the quad
at peak periods.
This i s just another exam-
rjle of Council sitting,pn their back-
sides and passing''ra'aelutions concern-
ing everyone without the least reg-
ard to the inconvenience caused.
Yours F a i t h f u l l y ,
B.H.Smythe.
Dear S i r ,
Now that a new session
i s beginning,could we have a new atmos-
phere i n the Union?
Last years Union Meetings
were dragged out by the interminable
wranglings of a few left-wing "Foot-
niks" and Communinsts, These slimy
Gentlemen have insiduously s l i d them-
selves into command of several soo—
i e t i e s and,not content with this,they
propogate themselves by trying to cre-
ate new societies,such as The Camp-
aign f o r Nuclear Disarmament,the South-
African Boycott Society,and the i l l -
fated(thank goodnessl)Pacifist Soc-
iety.
Is i t too much to hope
that the inevitable NUS motion w i l l
not be exhumed this session?Air(.acy
there are rumours that a motion i s
afoot to have the I.C.President elec-
ted from the f l o o r of the Union,aoo-
ompanied,no doubt, by the hysterical
propoganda and subversion of these
undercover agents.
I think that i t i s about
time that i t was made d e a r to these
.people that this College i s ,a place
for gentlemen and not embryonic s t r i k e
leaders.
