F E L I X
Lear S i r ,
Every alternate Friday last
session I was greeted by a rotund,red-
faced indivdual with a large voice and
a large beard,who t r i e d to s e l l me a
P e l i x . At lunch-time we had an A i l -
American, Eas t-£2nd iNewsvendor who prac-
tised the mating c a l l of the hyena as
he t r i e d to boost the c?.ls3 of h i s
rag. This unkemct,unshaven, iunwashed,
undressed,gibbering maniac,took i t as
a personal affront i f one did not pur-
chase a P e l i x .
But this was not my only reas-
on f o r not buying P e l i x . Being of Scot-
t i s h ancestry,I naturally examine any-
thing f o r which I am expected to pay
lfd,to see i f i t i s worth that much. I
fear that P e l i x i s not.
The sports coverage i n P e l i x
i s usually 10 days out of date. The
comment and l e t t e r s usually cover
some interminable p o l i t i c a l wrangle
in the rat-race f o r the Union Dic-
tatorship. The humour i s t r i v i a l and
c h i l d i s h . The gossip column i3 con-
cerned e n t i r e l y with people who l i v e
in the Hostel,and most of them are
unknown to me.
1 appreciate that covering
a l l the news i n College i s very d i f -
f i c u l t . Also i t i s clear that writiia-g'
a r t i c l e s of interest f o r people who
have no interests i s nearly impossible
however I am sure that the situation
could be improved with a l i t t l e conr
sideration and e f f o r t .
May I close on a note of
commendation? I think the reviews of
films and plays currently running i n
London i s a good idea and i t should
persuade more people to take advant-
age of the f a c i l i t i e s which are pro-
vided.
