After the end of the Summer
Term the Cricket Club made t h e i r
Annual sortie into the West Country,
If one reads -the o f f i c i a l report i t
might be thought that this wa3 just
another touring side intent on play-
ing the game. A l l that appeared i n
the record book i s : -
played 8 Won 4 Drawn 2 Lost 2.
However F e l i x , a f t e r suitably
b r i b i n g unwary members, i s able to t e l l
you the inside story.
On the f i r s t night injury
struck the side. harry Moss, the demon
bowler from Burnley, cracked his c o l l a r
bone. Unfortunately this d i d not
hu>pen l u a death or glory attempt at a
catch. I t happened when he f e l l from a
drainpipe as he was attempting to raid
A l Fawp'ett'a room with intent to remove
said gentleman's moustache.
By the third day the team
recovered from the shock, and John
preede stunned" the locals by taking 4
wickets, with his f i r s t 4 b a l l 3 - needless
to say I.C. won.
On the f i f t h nisht the team
were s t i l l celebrating. Skipper Logan,
with an unusually magnanimous gesture,
strode into the bar and set up j pinto
of shandy. Unfortunately no-one else
turned up and Alan was seen some hours
l a t e r enquiring f o r the t r a i n f o r
Middlesbrough. Paul Davies, not to be
outdone by his Captain, wa3 s t i l l drunk
on the 6th day. While trying to take
a b a l l behind the wicket he somehow
managed to head the b a l l f o r if byes -
only a yard short of 6.
By the 8tb day the team nnna^ed
to sober up and were rewarded by achieving
a f i n e v i c t o r y over Torquay.

It i s not often that one oan
s i t back and claim to have done the best
passible. Last Session the College w
Hockey, Socoer and Rugby F o o t b a l l teams
pulled off a unique achievement i n the
sporting history of the University by
winning the "Triple Crown" f o r the three
major University' Cup Competitions. So
one oan say immediately we can not hope
to do better; but we oan hope to repeat
the suooess.
With excellent f a c i l i t i e s f o r
t r a i n i n g , the high class opposition the
College name and past reputation
With excellent f a c i l i t i e s f o r
t r a i n i n g , the hieh class opposition the
College name and past record can demand,
and the enthusiasm injected into each
club by i t s o f f i c i a l s there i s no reason
why anyone should not play a f u l l part
i n maintaining the high standard set by
our'predecessors. Unfortunately only
about JOi of the College take any active
part i n games. There are many sports
c l u b s i n the College, each catering f o r
a l l standards from beginners to experts.
If you do not intend to take take the
game too seriously, you may l i k e to
play f o r one of the 'Sport Teams',
although rumour has i t that getting a
place i n the B.3s or 7th team i s now
harder than getting into the f i r s t team.
If you cannot f i n d the Cluhs
you require on your tour of the various
stands, please enquire f o r i t .
Some d e t a i l s of Team T r i a l s a
are riven on the back page.
F i n a l l y , take an old sportsman's
t i p - i f you don't want to l e t work
worry you, don't think about i t !

Once again the I.C. Water Polo
Club with i t s fish-emulating f r a t e r n i t y ,
went West t h i s summer. Although the
object was to play water polo, the un-
orthodox training i n the equalising of
i n t e r i o r and e x t e r i o r hydrostatic
pressures played havoc with the team.
The f i r s t match, against\
Weymouth, was played off the end of the
pier at high tide, and we lost 5-4.
The cold water and s l i g h t sunburn brought
about our defeat. Amusement wa3 caused
by Brian Hart leaving the p i t c h at half
time to pin up his trunks,
The following evening we played
Bridport, won by a handsome margin and
adjourned to a l o c a l pub. Here one of
the gentlemen, not l i k i n g the l o c a l beer,
drank cider. Catastrophically as i t
turned out. A f t e r pursuing a French
g i r l to a caravan s i t e , he arrived back
i l l . He saia next morning that he just
wanted to die the night before. How
near he «>3 to being tipped out of the
window, he' L l never know.
Travelling to Dartmouth R.K.C.
via Exmouth, we had our f i r s t swimming
match, which we l o s t , taking our cust-
omary positions of 2nd and 4th i n eaoh
race. We won the polo match.
This brought us to our toughest
f i x t u r e . Ilfracombe. A monumental
defeat was the r e s u l t , of the order 18-1..
We l e f t Ilfracombe."
The l a s t match, which provided
the finaj. to the tour, and the l o c a l
oernival, was at Mevagissey. A large
crowd saw us win ~>-4. Our goalkeeper
came i n f o r some c r i t i c i s m from the
crowd. That evening much beer was
drunk. Our captain was seen to be i n -
volved with a young woman. But as he's
how married, we wont talk about that.
Better not speak i l l of the dead.
