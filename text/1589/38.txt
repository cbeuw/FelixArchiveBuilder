Let’s talk: self-help resources
Diba Esbati shares her favourite self-help tools
It’s all well and good when you
have access to therapy, but
sometimes it’s be difficult to
get that kind of professional help,
be it because of the notorious NHS
Cognitive Behavioural Therapy
(CBT) waiting lists, or a personal
circumstance that prevents you from
approaching it all from a clinical
perspective.
Therefore, it is really useful to have
access to resources that can help you
cope and feel better either while you
wait for your CBT appointment or
until the situation changes and you
feel safe enough to seek more solid
forms of therapy.
I have had people come up to me
and ask what resources I found that
helped me cope, so I decided to share
these with you in the hopes that
it will help someone out there. As
always, please note that these are
things that I found helped me but
I’m not a medical professional of
any kind, and these are in no way
a substitute for professional help if
you’re in an emergency situation and
you feel like you need to get help as
soon as possible.
Books
First and foremost, things that
helped me understand what I was
going through a bit more clearly
and concretely were self-help books.
When I first approached my GP with
my anxiety issues, she told me about
the unfortunate NHS wait times,
and recommended a few books I
could check out whilst I waited, and
they each had the same approach.
It can be very overwhelming to try
and find a good book amongst the
cornucopia of books that claim to
offer a cure for every mental illness
under the sun, but it’s crucial to find
one that works for you if you want
to go down that route. The one that
I found helped me the most was the
“Overcoming ...” Series. These books
cover a wide variety of subjects and
take a logical approach to try and
help you understand how to calm
down and slowly beat what you’re
going through. A great thing is that
most of these books are available via
the imperial college library, so you
can check them out for free.
Podcasts
An unlikely useful resource that I
found were podcasts. It might seem
weird, but there was something
about listening to a couple of people
casually discuss issues that affect all
of us that really helped me. There are
plenty of free podcasts out there that
deal with various different issues,
from LGBTQ+ specific topics, to time
management skills and relaxation
techniques.
My favourite, and the one I found
most helpful, was a comedy podcast
by Cave Comedy Radio called
Sex and Other Human Activities
(SaOHA), hosted by comedians
Marcus Parks and Jackie Zebrowski.
The reason I enjoyed SaOHA so
much was because Jackie and Marcus
discussed their own struggles with
mental illness candidly, openly, and
most importantly, with humour,
laughing and joking about it all.
They also reply to emails and
problems that people write to them
about, but of course, everything
If you are concerned
about your own mental
health,or that of a loved
one,there are people out
there you can talk to who
can give you advice,or will
be there to listen.

You can also go to your
academic or personal tutor
regarding pastoral issues,
especially if you think your
mental health might be
affecting your academic
performance.
Mental health
helplines
and resources
they say should be taken with a
truckload of salt since their advice
is predominantly for entertainment
purposes.
Internet Forums
As much as I would urge you all to
speak to your friends and family
about issues that might be bother-
ing you, I understand that it might
not always be a viable option. Just
because you might not be ready to
speak to someone you know person-
ally, it doesn’t mean you have to
keep everything bottled up – that’s
not healthy, or fair to yourself! So
what can you do?
I found that finding a safe space,
like a forum on the internet can be
a wonderful thing, especially since
most people on these forums are
going through, or have gone through,
something similar and can both re-
late and give you appropriate advice.
I can’t recommend any particular
forum, because it really depends on
what works for you and what kinds
of people you feel safest talking to.
Imperial College Counselling
Service Workshops
It’s also worth mentioning that
the college counselling service
runs stress management and exam
performance workshops at select
times during term. Although
I’ve only attended one of these
workshops, and I personally didn’t
find it massively helpful, I’ve heard
many people say that it helped
them manage their exam stress and
it’s worth giving them a shoutout.
Their next workshop is at 12:30,
Thursday, 27th November, focusing
on building self-esteem, and there is
an exam stress management one at
14:00, Wednesday, 10th December,
so it might be worth checking out.
It’s worth noting that you will need
to email them and let them know
you would like to attend, since places
are limited.
Apps
You know what they say, there is
always an app for everything, and
wellbeing is no exception. There are
countless, often reliable, smartphone
apps that you can use for things such
as keeping track of your moods, what
could be triggering certain episodes,
keep track of your medication, and
even wind down from a panic attack.
My favourite app at the moment is
SAM (Self-help for Anxiety Manage-
ment), which has some breathing
exercises as well as several other
anxiety management techniques.
If you’re interested in finding a
much more indepth list of resources
that you can use, I suggest going to
mentalillnessmouse.tumblr.com where
you can find more tried and tested
self-help things.
There are many online forums that can provide help and deliver it straight to your room Photo credit: Wyman
