studies the earth’s magnetic field,
we have to deal with all that plus the
extra radiation from the van Allen
belts of charged particles.
The temperature is extremely
low, and that’s a challenge, but the
radiation environment isn’t too bad.
What will be a big challenge is the
dust and gas.
We usually think of a spacecraft
in a vacuum. In this case, the comet
will boil off gas and dust from below
the surface. The real challenge for
Rosetta is that this will collect on
the orbiter and create drag. Usually
Newton’s laws will tell you exactly
where a spacecraft will be, but this
extra drag makes Rosetta’s motion
unpredictable.
How do you go about designing
an instrument to send into deep
space?
If we want to measure particles or
a magnetic field, the instrument
technology is pretty well developed.
Particle detectors for use in the lab
are relatively easy things to make.
If we want to send an instrument
into space, we’re trying to measure
extremely small magnetic fields
and plasma densities (about 1-2
nanotesla (compared with 40-50
on earth), so we need very sensitive
instruments. They have to be very
high quality, but also very robust
to survive the rocket launch and
extreme cold.
The key thing though is reliability.
Almost uniquely for a piece of
instrumentation, we can’t just go
up and fix it if something goes
wrong. We use a lot of military-
grade electronic components with
guaranteed reliability and radiation
hardness. This also makes things
very expensive — for Rosetta, each
chip costs around $10,000. And to
ensure reliability, there’s a lot of
redundancy built in so if one fails we
always have a back up.
What have you been doing for the
past 10 years while Rosetta was
travelling to the comet?
It hasn’t been entirely dormant
whilst we’ve been flying there. There
was some data to be taken while we
were flying past Earth, Mars and
two asteroids. All instruments were
operational in those periods, being
tested and helping us prepare for the
rendezvous.
At Imperial, we’ve also been
heavily involved in programmes like
Cassini and Cluster. Rosetta was a
part-time project, but it’s suddenly
become very busy.
How closely have you been
working with other groups?
The plasma consortium is a big team
already, with people involved from
right across Europe and the US. We
do work with other teams though,
particularly the magnetometer
on the lander, so we can compare
our measurements with them.
There’s also a mass spectrometer,
and an instrument on the orbiter
called ROSINA, which investigates
neutral gases and ions. There are
big meetings with all three groups
— the next one’s in three weeks —
where we share our findings and see
how measurements from different
instruments can support each other.
Has the mission gone as you
expected when you first started
working on the project?
Actually it has really. The goal
of Rosetta was to make the
first rendezvous with a comet,
characterise it in orbit and send the
lander down, and we achieved that.
Everyone thought it was a bit of a
crazy idea. To rendezvous would be
hard, to land would be even harder.
NASA’s Comet Rendezvous was
cancelled because of the difficulties
involved, but the ESA persevered.
Across the project there’s been a
feeling that it was hard but we did it.
What else are groups at Imperial
working on at the moment?
I’m the principal investigator (PI)
for the magnetometer on Cluster,
which keeps me occupied most
of the time. I also run the Space
Magnetometer Lab here. Groups
from Imperial are working on
planned missions: BepeColombo
to Mercury and Solar Orbiter — the
PI for that magnetometer is Tim
Horbury. We’ve recently been
selected to build instruments for
the JUICE mission to Jupiter that
Michele Dougherty will be working
on — a lot of the development for
that will be done at Imperial.
We’re also working on CubeSats:
miniature satellites to map the
magnetosphere using sensors similar
to those you find as compasses
in phones. They aim to relate the
magnetic field in low-earth with that
measured by an array of ground-
based detectors to see how the solar
wind penetrates the earth’s magnetic
field.
"The key
thing
though is
reliability.”
"There's
been a
feeling
that it was
hard, but
we did it."
