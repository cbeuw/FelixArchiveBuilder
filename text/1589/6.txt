Felix paid a visit to the
construction site of the new
Halls, One Victoria Road,
to investigate how things were
progressing and to talk to Campus
Services about the latest news and
updates on the project.
Currently, no decision has yet
been taken on the future of Evelyn
Gardens. All that is known for
certain is that all Evelyn Gardens
halls will be shut down for the
next year. Jane Neary, Head of
Campus Services, explained that
this is simply due to the Evelyn
Garden Halls not being up to the
required standard – whether the
halls will reopen in future years is
something that will hopefully be
decided in the coming year, but
even if they were to re-open they
are on a limited lease.
The new site itself is divided
into four buildings, the tallest of
which reaches twenty stories into
the sky. Block A, the southernmost
building, is to consist of purely
communal facilities including a
bar and restaurant, a volunteer/
community space and a gym split
across two floors.
The three other interconnected
buildings, B-D, will provide
accommodation for 603 students,
102 of whom will be in twin
rooms with all rooms being en-
suites. As with the newer halls in
Prince’s Gardens, the rooms will
be arranged into ‘blocks’ of 6/7
students, each of which will have
a communal kitchen. The sample
kitchen that Felix was shown was
on the 18th floor of Block D. The
kitchens bulge from the side of the
building in such a way that they
provide views of almost 180° across
London through the curved glass-
panelled wall.
Campus Services were also keen
to highlight the features of the
new rooms: a 6’6” long double bed,
and increased storage space as
compared to the last set of Halls
built by the College in Prince’s
Gardens. However, some students
have expressed reservations about
the announced price of the rooms:
the expected cost of a single will
be £165 per week and a twin will
be £125 per week. Once the £20+
per week cost of a Zones 1 and 2
Travelcard is added, the average
rent per room will be higher than it
is currently in Evelyn Gardens.
The College were also keen to
point out that there will be no
decrease in the Wardening ratios
as a result of the move: provision
has been made for 12 Subwardens
and 2 Wardens to be split across
the three blocks. Also there is space
onsite for a Union office, and it is
promised that students will be able
to use the nearby Health Centre.
Other communal facilities will
include a multi-faith prayer room,
storage for 300 bikes, quiet study
space and music rehearsal rooms,
a rooftop terrace, a barbecue area
and the usual communal spaces
with games and TVs for use by the
residents.
The location is significantly
further away from Campus than
the current Halls. College were
keen to point out that the Central
line will be running 24 hours
by the time the new Halls open,
and that there will be a Crossrail
station a short walk away when it
becomes operational. The building is still under construction, but the kitchens offer amazing views over...Acton Photo: Stephen Ball
