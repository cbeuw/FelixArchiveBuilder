Darije Custovic reviews Dostoyevsky’s irst existentialist novel
"... he wants
to show us
something
real: a dark
and dirty
corner of
the human
spirit."
" I am a
sick man...
I am an
angry man.
I am an un-
attractive
man."
“Iam a sick man... I am an angry
man. I am an unattractive
man.”
This is the opening line of
Dostoyevsky’s early work Notes From
the Underground. They are the words
of the unnamed narrator, the fictive
author of the titular notes written
from “underground” – his term for
his own self-imposed isolation. Every
word that follows after this acts to
reinforce these first statements; they
reveal the nature of his sickness,
bring out the bitterness in his rage,
and expose his impotent, mean, and
above all, ugly spirit. This is not
easy reading – but it is potent, for
Dostoyevsky’s purpose is not simply
to invent a horrible character, a
caricature. He wants more; he wants
to show us something real: a dark and
dirty corner of the human spirit that,
frankly, we may not want to look at.
The realism that Dostoyevsky creates
captivates the reader; he understands
what it is to inhabit this part of the
human spirit, and he shows us the
worldview, thought processes, and
feelings that come with its habitation.
It’s tragic... it’s repulsive. But, we are
shown, it is there.
The book itself is set out in two
parts. The first is essentially a long
monologue where the narrator,
the man from the underground,
expounds his outlook on life and
tries to illuminate the causes of
and reasoning behind it. And what
an outlook! Straight away we are
hit by the twisted mass of paradox
and contradiction that he carries in
himself:;he is ill, he doesn’t know
what it is; he respects doctors, but he
proclaims his respect for medicine
to be superstitious; he won’t visit a
doctor, to be spiteful: spiteful against
whom? Who knows? He doesn’t.
He knows he will achieve nothing
through inaction. This compulsively
contradictory nature, always pulling
the narrator’s mind hard in two
directions, manifests itself again
and again, and becomes a relentless
tug-of-war on the reader’s own
mind and sympathies: on the one
hand, the narrator’s breathtaking
arrogance about his own intellectual
and aesthetic capacities, and on
the other, declarations that “all
intellectual activity is a disease”;
strident statements about his firmest
convictions, which end in thin
jokes about how he doesn’t believe a
word he’s said; his disturbing pride
at explaining the “finessed” and
masochistic pleasure he gets from
being “too clearly aware of [his] own
degradation”.
Yet, for all the confusion this play
of point and counterpoint creates, we
also see passages of startling lucidity,
where the narrator lays down
systematic, reasoned arguments,
apologies for his strange beliefs
and his behaviour – though, of
course, the conclusions reached are
questionable, at best. But this clarity,
too, Dostoyevsky folds into a paradox,
as we see not only contradictory
thoughts existing side-by-side, but
contradictory thought processes, the
narrator veering from his lucidity
down paths of thought where there
are only outpourings of nonsense
and emptiness. And then, to pull us
further into contradiction, we find
that the narrator is supremely aware
of his psychology, and of his own
deformity; he is not simply stupid.
All this drags us into the morass of
the man from the underground’s
thinking, and very effectively so;
if I have a criticism of the book, it
is that this aspect of the narrator’s
character is, in a sense, too effectively
portrayed – it gets tiring quickly, and
infuriates easily, though I suspect this
is exactly how such a character would
be in reality. Something stopped
me from putting the book down,
however – despite the extremity of
the narrator’s contradictions, and
their ability to infuriate, the reader
cannot help but see something
reflected back at them; we see in these
contradictions our ability to assert
our will, and our sometime desires
to be different, to not do what we’re
supposed to do, and to push against
the boundaries we feel around us.
This juxtaposition – of the narrator’s
extremes and our repugnance at
them, against our recognition that we
possess some of those same elements
– plays throughout the first part of
the book: not just in the narrator’s
contradictions, but in his laziness, his
anger, his neediness, and his doubts.
The second part of the book is
more straightforward, being a
collection of stories drawn from the
narrator’s life, each illustrating how
his personality and worldview, laid
out in such detail in the first part,
play out in a variety of situations – in
bars and restaurants, placed opposite
officers, acquaintances, and whores.
The second part is an easier read,
being both simpler to follow and
livelier in pace; it is entertaining
and, at times, funny. But all of this
is still underpinned by a distinctly
sombre tone, which comes to the
fore when our narrator encounters
the prostitute Liza. Here, in the
scenes involving her, Dostoyevsky
takes us deep into the psyche of the
underground man – to the sad, limp,
ineffectuality at his core. Once we
have seen his essence, Dostoyevsky
lets us go: in a poignant scene, during
the narrator’s second and final
encounter with Liza, she leaves, and
takes us, the reader, with her; we
can finally leave the man from the
underground – so contradictory,
infuriating and disturbing – behind.
And him? He is left “decaying
morally in a corner” in the same place
we found him.
