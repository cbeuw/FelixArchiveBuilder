Adog saved its owners from a
fire after the smoke alarm
failed. ‘Smokey’ the dog,
as nicknamed by the firemen who
rescued the family, woke the rest of
the house when smoke began to fill
the ground floor property, located on
Stanlake Road in Shepherd’s Bush.
Mr Hughes, one of the tenants
of the flat, said of the dog – who is
nicknamed Moo – “I woke up to Moo
barking like crazy so opened the door
and was hit with a wall of smoke. She
was sleeping in Rob’s room so he’d
woken up about 30 seconds before
and thought he could put the fire
out by himself but quickly realised
he couldn’t because the flames were
getting pretty big so ran upstairs to let
the other people know.
“She normally sleeps in the living
room so she probably would have
woken us up earlier but who knows if
we would have got out in time.
“Moo is such a great dog anyway but
she’s been getting lots of treats since
the fire. It was raining and cold when
we were standing outside the flat after
being rescued so we put a cardigan on
her and she managed to find some
cake in a hedge so she was alright.
We’re very grateful to Moo.”
Mr Hughes said the fire was caused
by an electrical fault but everything
has melted so it is difficult to
establish where it started.
The firemen on duty that morning
issued a warning to people about
checking their smoke alarms
regularly, as the one in the flat in
question had run out of batteries.
First ever ‘Royal Mixer’
is held at Imperial
College Union
The first ever Royal Mixer,
which took place last
Thursday 13th Nov 2014 at
Metric, saw students from a host
of other “Royal” institutions in
London attend an Imperial-based
social for the first time.
The event was jointly organized
by the unions at Imperial, the Royal
College of Music (RCM), the Royal
College of Art (RCA) and the Royal
Veterinary College (RVC). It saw
approximately 590 attendees, of
which 78% were Imperial College
students.
Approximately 4.7% of the 1900
RCM and RCA population were
at the event, alongside 40 RVC
students out of their 2000 student
population – an impressive feat
given the the geographic location of
the RVC.
A plethora of student bands
played throughout the evening on
the stage at Metric.
Those who attended the event said
it was “Pretty chill, like any other
night in Metric on a Thursday.
“They seem like a standard
bunch.”
Union President Tom Wheeler
told Felix: “I thoroughly enjoyed
the evening, and really enjoyed the
opportunity to meet students from
other Students Union’s at our first
Collaborative event of the year.
“We have received really positive
feedback on the event and had lots
of our members ask for a repeat
event. The next Royal Mixer will be
hosted by one of our neighbours,
and we are planning to host another
Mixer in the Spring Term.”
The event marks the first of
several nights that are seeing
high numbers of attendace for a
Thursday night. At the time of
press, the Tri Union Bar night had
also reached capacity.
