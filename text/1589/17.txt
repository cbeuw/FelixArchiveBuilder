The release of the iPad in the
UK in the early summer of
2010 was a watershed moment
which forever changed the way we
interact with application technology.
It was only a matter of time before
a number of social entrepreneurs
decided to weave the creative talent
together in the form of conventions,
and seeing promise and potential
in the emerging technological
industries, catalyse creative
development in the area. Apps World
is one such conference which has been
growing since its debut five years ago,
which means that on Wednesday
12 November 2014, I attended the
biggest developer conference ever
held in the UK to date.
After finally reaching my
destination, a medium-sized hall in
the corner of the ExCel exhibition
centre, I registered for my press pass
(which is required to attend all the
conferences and would normally set
you back the value of the Gold Pass,
£995) and took a look inside. My first
impression was disheartening. I saw
representatives from start-ups in
neatly pressed suits, wearing faces of
uncomfortable courtesy in a field of
stalls awash in blue, grey, and black. I
saw nothing of the open, expressive,
and passionate start-up culture
I was expecting – hardworking,
independent, and creative developers
– and all of the hard, cold masks
reminiscent of the ones given to every
new employee of the financial sector
each year. This was when I made the
(perhaps premature) decision to skip
the party in the evening at the O2,
with an entry fee of £55.
However, not being one to be
deterred by my refuted expectations,
I headed inside to take a look at the
stalls which were shared between
marketers from established
companies, start-ups, and game
developers. The former, including
brands such as Amazon, focussed
entirely on selling their product to
developers.
I recognised half the brands
from the questionable advertising
arising from mass-contacting and
abusing my company’s contact
details. Upon being questioned by
me on the product specifics, none of
the representatives could actually
answer my questions as a developer
(“how easy is this API to integrate
into my app compared to other
networks?” to the Amazon mobile
ads representative, for example)
which effortlessly exposed them as
pure marketers, ill-suited to pitching
products they know little about to
seasoned developers and passionate
enthusiasts.
Having moved past this rather
painful kick in the teeth, I headed
over to where the start-ups and game
developers were showcasing their
products. I was surprised to learn
that most of these were in alpha or
beta stage, and that they came to
gain exposure through the press or
perhaps even funding opportunities.
A team of designers showed me
their Oculus Rift virtual beach
simulation, and I had a chat with a
Taiwanese developer releasing his
Android game onto the Western
market. I tried a web-based browser
game and then broke the physics of
an arcade simulation just around the
corner.
I was feeling slightly better at
this point – this is the side of the
industry that sufficiently motivated
me to teach myself four years of
programming in the first place – but
I couldn’t ignore the tendency to
lean towards the investor-focussed
displays. In short, there were a lot
of creative ideas in development,
but they were all exactly that: in
development, and almost certainly
looking for money, rather than
exposure.
The ‘workshops’ which one would
normally have to pay so much for
turned out to be mainly panels, with
people with long titles giving tips in
monotonic voices about how ‘best’
to develop and implement strategies
for the specific platforms. Since there
wasn’t a unified timetable in the first
place, choosing which workshops

Xuan Chen discusses his disappointing trip to the UK Apps Conference
"...Exposed
them as pure
marketers,
ill-suited
to pitching
products
they know
little about
to seasoned
developers
and
passionate
enthusiasts"
"There were a
lot of
creative
ideas in
development,
but they were
all exactly
that: in
development,
and almost
certainly
looking
for money,
rather than
exposure"
to attend added extra stress to the
event participator as you’d always be
missing out on something whilst you
were in a different room listening to a
different panel, and it wasn’t exactly
the kind of material you could drop
in and out of.
The panels may have been of
some use to some extremely niche
developers but they weren’t overtly
engaging or interesting; you have
to sit down, take notes, and pay
attention to get the most out of it.
Credit should be given to those
companies which did make an
effort with adding creative flair
to their product marketing and
sending passionate developers to
engage with the passing audience,
but unfortunately they were the
minority and I get the impression
that the target audience (young, naive
business school grads who think that
turning up in a suit is impressive)
didn’t care that much about their
efforts either.
I absolutely hate the side of
capitalism which suffocates the
creative industries in favour of
capital-returning investments.
Unfortunately, the event that I so
hoped to be a stalwart unification
of opposition against the corporate
norms came very close to being
just a networking event for those
exact people. I sincerely hope that
technologies continue to evolve at
their current expeditious pace, so that
those with real creative passion can
continue to stay one step ahead of
the soul-crushing capitalism; able to
showcase their unique creations and
designs and to receive just praise and
admiration for it in the future.
