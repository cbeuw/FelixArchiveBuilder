Bright ‘N’ Early Success for IC Cross Country
Ihope the pun in the title will be
more welcome than it was at the
disgustingly early hour of 5:30am
at Clapham Junction on Sunday the
16th November. It was at this hour
that 40 members of the Imperial
Cross Country and Athletics Club met
to make the trip to the Brighton 10k
2014, well before the opening of any
coffee shops and tube stations and at
the same time as most young people
stagger home after a mental Saturday
night out.
But undoubtedly, it was worth the
early start.
With no rain and a pancake flat
course along the seafront, it was
always going to be a fast race but
Imperial runners seemed to make
the most of the conditions to clock a
ridiculous number of personal bests
and to take home the lion’s share of
the prizes. At the front, the men’s
team of Chris Olley, Liam Smith,
Chris Thomas and James Ellis led
the charge to be the 2nd men’s team
overall, having each run a personal
best. Sarah Johnson, Imo Simmonds,
Alex Mundell and Kara Meunier
almost matched the boys when they
stormed to third place in the women’s
team event.
It was not surprising that the teams
did so well with all the shouts and
high fives between runners as parts
of the course looped back on itself.
Being able to cheer on your fellow
Imperialites both ahead and behind
you during the race is one of the best
things about the course, and really
takes your mind off any complaining
your legs might be doing.
Imperial stole more awards in the
individual prizes with Chris Olley
and Alex Mundell winning the U20
categories. In the process, Chris came
8th in the entire field of around
3000 runners in a personal best of 31
minutes 47 seconds. Sarah, while also
forcing many of the men to up their
game, placed 6th among the women
in a time of 37 minutes 31 seconds.
Our success did not end with those
at the front as there were many
stunning performances from the
debutants at the distance and fierce
intra-club competitive battles.
Once all the running business was
done, the celebrations included a
necessary post-race cake feast and
team photo on the seafront, complete
with sweaty face paint. Clearly, there
was need for celebration afterwards,
at the civilised time of 11:45. Merry
times in the local Wetherspoons,
the banter train carriage home and
a small after-party were definitely
entertaining and didn’t fail to
disappoint. The early evening for us
felt like gone midnight, and while
I cannot confirm the stories of
fresher’s falling asleep on pub floors
or falling down stairs… I can confirm
that most of the team were in bed by
9pm that night after a truly epic day.
It’s not too late to get involved in
future IC XCA trips, there will be
many more next term. Email run@

Immortals
lose 22-12
Sunday 16th brought the
Imperial Immortals’irst away
game of the season against the
Hertfordshire Hurricanes.The
Hurricanes are an impressive
team that made the semi-
inals last season,the same
as the Immortals.This was an
important match for both teams
as the Immortals were looking to
extend their season to 2-0 while
Hurricanes wanted their irst win
of the season.
The Immortals started on
defense,where they started
strong causing a forced fumble
that was recovered by Imperial to
put on the offence.The offence
came up against arguably the
second best defense in the
country,which were on form for
sure.The offense struggled in the
irst half but the defense came
through and limited Herts to
19,making some huge goal line
stops to stuff the high powered
Hertfordshire offence.
The second half was a different
story where the Immortals
offence took charge,while
the defense remained strong,
and put up 12 points through a
quarterback run that made over
50 yards by Bob Worksfromhome
and lovely link up between Bob
and Noach from Coventry.The
hard running of Emmanuel
Olagbaju and the explosive
blocking from the offensive line,
including Sweet Joe Downey,
Ugly Henry Turner,Pecs Badham
and Rookie Markus Mohr,
allowed the passing game to be
set up which gave the Immortals
their second touchdown of the
day.
There has to be a special mention
for Kyung Hoon Moon who put
in a massive effort taking snaps
on offense as fullback,defense
as linebacker and special teams.
The game inished 22-12 to
Hertfordshire but the game felt
like anything but a loss with the
Immortals more than holding
their own,with so many injuries.
The Most Valuable Players were:
Kyung Hoon Moon (overall),
Bob Worksfromhome (offense),
Alex Hitchinson (defense),Pecs
Badham (line) and Markus
Mohr (offense rookie).Make
no mistake; this game was
a statement to the rest of
the league that the Imperial
Immortals play premiership
football with or without their
ideal line-ups.
