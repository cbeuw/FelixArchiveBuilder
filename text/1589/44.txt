Imperial receives £65k of lottery funding for
casual sport initiative
Sport Imperial have launched a
new initiative, aimed at people
who want to play casual sport
without the pressure of being a part
of a sports club or the atmosphere of
being in Ethos for a fitness class or
gym session.
Imperial College has been
recognised as the top university
for sport in the South East by the
British Universities & Colleges
Sport organisation, and has recently
been commended by the European
Network of Academic Sport Services
(ENAS) for its previous participation
events, ‘goFit’ and ‘One Big Thing’.
Impetus is the first long-term
event to take place, with 13 sessions
running every week.
The programme costs £30 for
the year and is open to any student
or staff member at Imperial. Sport
Imperial has also received part of
a £65,000 lottery-funded grant
from Sport England, as part of
the ‘University Sport Activation’
programme, the successor to ‘Active
Universities’.
Impetus is one of a number of
similar initiatives, with King’s
College to receive over £240,000 for
their version, ‘BeActive’, over the
next three years. This extra funding
has allowed them to run 22 sessions a
week, in a wider variety of locations
– although this is perhaps not
surprising given their more varied
spread of campuses. King’s College
has also been running the initiative,
having received funding in the first
of two rounds so far.
The sports available, taken from
student feedback earlier in the
year, include ultimate frisbee and
triathlon, in addition to more regular
sports such as tennis and badminton.
Sessions are being delivered by Hyde
Park ‘s ‘Will to Win’, who own the
tennis courts between Hyde Park and
Kensington Gardens, as well as some
sessions by the Active Lifestyles team
at Ethos, and other partners.
Interestingly, football and gym
work do not feature in Impetus,
despite being the two activities with
highest participation among people

Ben Howitt reports on Sport Imperial’s new programme, Impetus
aged 18-21.
Xu Yag, who was one of those to sign
up for tennis in the first week, saw
improvement within two weeks, and
continues to enjoy the sessions.
One of the organisers is Jenni
Phillips, the Student Sports
Experience Officer (Participation),
appointed as part of a restructure to
separate Sport Imperial’s dual aims
of participation and excellence (now
represented by Hannah Blandford,
previously Sports Partnership Officer
at the Union). When asked about the
College’s attitude to the program, she
responded “they recognise the gap in
provision [for people who don’t do
sport]”.
Jenni is managing the promotion
and marketing of the programme,
aiming to make it clear that Sport
Imperial caters to people with less
time, commitment and experience.
Another aim, long term, is to
expand the sports available currently,
and to offer the chance for students
to assist with the delivery of sessions.
There is also an awareness that for
full success, Impetus must spread
to campuses other than South
Kensington – although the space may
well be harder to find outside of the
South Kensington bubble.
There has been engagement with
the Sports teams, including ongoing
conversation between the ACC and
Sport Imperial. Fears that College-run
schemes might pull students away
from club membership (we do, after
all, already have an Ultimate Frisbee
Club) appeared to be groundless
during the Active Universities
initiative, and it is to be hoped that
this success can be repeated both at
Imperial and at a national level. The
onus will be on Clubs and Societies
to engage with the initiative and
modify their recruitment methods
accordingly.
Impetus is open to suggestions of
different sports and people interested in
helping out – if you want to know more,
contact Jenni at jennifer.phillips@ic.ac.
uk. If you want to take part, the form to
fill out (only A6) is available at Ethos
reception.
18:00 on a Friday evening always
carries a certain amount of feel-
good factor.However,on Friday 7th
November,this was more a sense
of jubilation as the results of the
Citi Society Challenge 2014 were
released,crowning the Chemical
Engineering Society the winners
from Imperial College!
A process which began in July and
involved a written application,
inished with a inal of three
societies battling it out for the votes
of Imperial students.
Our campaign was based around
delivering quality,innovation and
passion: clearly demonstrating to
Citi the value ChemEngSoc provides
to its members ( conirmed by the
Imperial student body).
As a university so well known for
its incredible diversity of clubs
and societies,we are incredibly
proud to have been recognised
both internally and externally as a
leading organisation within this.
We would like offer our sincerest
thanks to Citi Group for offering
us this opportunity to excel and to
the vast number of students,both
Chemical Engineering and others,
who voted for us over the last
month.
