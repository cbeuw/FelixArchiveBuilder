Ten days ago, controversial
internet sensation Daniel
O’Reilly appeared on an
exclusive Newsnight interview to
announce the retirement of his
comedic persona, Dapper Laughs.
For connoisseurs of quality humour
the nation over, it is a welcome end
to what has been a meteoric rise of
internet stardom characterised by
a litany of increasingly poor taste,
misogynistic diatribe, culminating
in O’Reilly telling a woman that she
was “gagging for a rape” at a stand
up show. Why exactly anyone would
be “gagging” to be raped is anyone’s
guess. Rape is hardly a trivial matter;
it leaves physical and mental scars
that may never fully fade, if they
fade at all. It destroys people’s lives,
minds, bodies and relationships. He
may as well have accused the woman
of “gagging to have her legs blown off
by an IED”.
Of course the resultant media
furore was rightly targeted at
Dapper Laughs himself. I will not
repeat the many complaints against
his puerile antics here; they have
been articulated hundreds of times
before in editorials, social media,
the blogosphere, or any other forum
for public opinion one can think of.
They are misguided, however: Dapper
Laughs is simply a manifestation of
a wider illness in our culture, and it
is this illness which will need to be
addressed if any meaningful progress
is to be made.
Consider for a moment that Dapper
Laughs’ particular brand of juvenile
sexual spivery and vulgar attitudes
towards rape (“If you whip your dick
out and she starts crying, she’s just
playing hard to get”) can be viewed
a commodity, subject to the same
laws of supply and demand as wheat,
gold, or timber. If the demand exists,
then someone sooner or later will
supply. If there is no demand, then
there is no incentive to supply. That
this article is even being written is an
indication that Dapper Laughs was
able to fill a niche that is very much
in demand. The pertinent question
would therefore be: why does this
demand exist in the first place?
There is a far deeper issue here than
just Dapper Laughs. That he exists
at all is the result of a pervading
climate of indifference regarding
rape and violence towards women. It
is the same attitude that allowed the
footballer and convicted rapist, Ched
Evans, to resume training with his old
club, Sheffield United, after serving
only half of a five year sentence. That
Evans was tried, and found guilty
– beyond all reasonable doubt – of
forcing himself upon a nineteen
year old girl is seemingly immaterial
in the eyes of the club; he resumed
training as straightforwardly as if he
had just recovered from an injury.
What we are fundamentally saying
when we allow these things to happen
is that it’s okay for our celebrities and
our sportsmen – our role models – to
perpetrate violence towards women
because they will release clemency
from society in return.
Ultimately, it is good and right to go
after Dapper Laughs and Ched Evans;
they are both deserving of criticism.
However, they will be replaced by
others in the not too distant future if
the underlying issues in our society
are not addressed. After all, as any
doctor would advise: don’t treat the
symptoms, treat the disease.
The retirement of Dapper Laughs
What are prices? Who
decides prices? Walking
down a supermarket aisle,
we see a wide variety of complicated
pricing schemes; buy one get one free,
half price, special offers and the like.
These prices seem either carefully
calculated – what makes them so
specific?
Most people think of a price in
terms of how much goods are worth.
However, this assertion misses a
distinction between ‘price’ and ‘value’.
The price that a company charges for
a good or service is influenced by a
wide variety of factors; for example,
competition in a town grocer’s
market can decrease the price of
vegetables as competitors undercut
each other.
In economics, price is often defined
as the intersection of supply and
demand. This means that companies
will set their price when it ‘clears
the market’ and the exact amount
of goods that they produce will be
bought by consumers. There is no
excess demand or supply at this price.
However, economic models do not
often match reality. Sometimes prices
are determined by market structure,
the larger economic situation or even
business objectives.
On a recent trip to Carphone
Warehouse, I was looking at cases for
the new iPhone 6, when I noticed that
all the cheapest models were priced
between £12.99 and £14.99. The cases
are injection-moulded and I would
guess cost less than 50p to make. This
profit margin seems extortionate.
How can Carphone Warehouse get
away with such prices, and why are
consumers willing to pay so much?
One possible answer could be the
psychology of the market. iPhones
are expensive, and people are willing
to spend more on a case to protect
their phone: the higher the price, the
higher the perceived value of the case.
People feel that buying a cheap case
will be a poor investment, and will
not protect their phone in the long
run.
This factor might make this
product a ‘Giffen good’. This is when a
good goes against market convention
and the quantity demanded of the
good increases rather than decreases
when the price is increased.
Another answer is that the cases
have an inelastic price. This means
that a large change in price will
only cause a small drop in quantity
demanded. Since the demand for
the iPhone case is ‘derived’ from
the demand for the iPhone, even if
the iPhone case is very expensive,
the demand for the cases will not
change much, as long as people still
buy iPhones. This is true as long as
the price of the case is relatively low
compared that of the phone.
An additional answer might be that
the different manufacturers of cases
are colluding to keep to the same
high price. If collusion is proven in a
market, although this is very difficult,
this can lead to legal battles. Perhaps
the price is high due to the overheads
of the machines that produce the
cases. Whatever the reason, iPhone
cases are a classic example of market
imperfection.
