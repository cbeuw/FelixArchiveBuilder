How did you get involved with
Rosetta?
That goes back a long time. I was
first involved in 1997. Our group is
interested in space physics, making
measurments of plasmas, particles
and magnetic fields. At the time I
was working on Cluster — a project
to map the earth’s magnetic field.
When the ESA was looking into
Rosetta, they wanted a team to run
the magnetometer, and they came
to us because of our experience on
Cluster.
My Principal Investigator,
Andre Balogh, got involved and
came together with other groups
to develop the instrumentation
package, with Imperial as the main
data processing centre. I later
became the lead at Imperial.
What is Rosetta trying to
achieve that couldn’t be done by
telescopes or previous spacecraft?
Rosetta isn’t the first mission to
a comet — there have been quite a
few. The most famous is the Giotto
mission to Halley in 1986, but there
were two others in the same year:
a Russian and a Japanese mission,
which were looking at the comet as
it was close to the sun, boiling off
lots of gas and dust and making a
big spectacle. They flew through
this cloud, the coma of the comet, at
about 10km/s, in just a few hours.
What Rosetta is doing is
fundamentally different. It’s no
longer a fly-by mission as it’s in
the same orbit as the comet and
will travel with it, observing its
evolution over a whole year as it
boils off dust and gas. We needed
10 years to get there as we had to
get gravity assists from Mars and
Jupiter in order to match the speed
of the comet.
Rosetta will also be making in
situ measurements of its chemical
composition. You can’t use
instrumentation on earth if you
want to sample what the comet is
made of and investigate the dust and
gas coming off it.
Your group works on the
magnetometers on the Rosetta
orbiter. What are you trying to
find out with this instrument?
We’ve been involved with
magnetometers on other space
missions, particularly Cluster and
Venus Express, and will be building
the magnetometer for Solar Orbiter,
the BepiColombo mission to
Mercury, and the JUICE mission to
Jupiter.
The magnetometer on Rosetta was
built in Germany. What we built is
the ‘brain’ and the power supply for
the whole consortium that connects
the 5 plasma sensors. There’s also
a separate magnetometer on the
lander, Philae, run by a different
group.
We don’t know much about the
magnetic field around a comet,
although it won’t be very strong.
You have a magnetic field from the
sun and solar wind, which drown out
any signal you’d get from the comet.
When the comet starts boiling off
lots of dust and water molecules,
the particles coming off get ionised
by UV radiation from the sun. This
creates lots of highly conductive
plasma around the comet, which
shield off the solar wind. This
should let us see how the comet’s
magnetosphere develops. We hope
to compare these magnetic field
measurements with those from the
lander to see what this can tell us
about the nucleus.
Have you discovered anything
interesting so far?
We’ve seen two things that we
weren’t expecting.
Water molecules boil off the
comet and are ionised by solar UV
radiation. These ions should gyrate
and produce a magnetic field with
a characteristic frequency. We’ve
seen a frequency much lower than
we expected — about 30-50mHz.
This doesn’t really fit with our
understanding of how ionised water
molecules should behave.
As well as that, we’ve seen low
energy water ions coming directly
from the comet at thermal speeds,
as expected. We’ve also seen some
at much higher energy. We think
they have actually drifted past the
spacecraft and been pushed back by
the solar wind — they can achieve
higher energies because they’ve had
longer to be accelerated.
How do you operate a spacecraft
so far away from earth?
In principle it’s run like any other
mission. Emanuele Cupido is
responsible for communicating
between our group and the ESA.
We have a set of protocols to
send command instructions that
are prepared in advance. This is
necessary not only because it has
to be carefully checked, but also
because you don’t have real-time
access. There is a half-hour delay
in communication because of the
distances involved, and the limit
imposed by the speed of light.
From our perspective it’s not
much different to other missions.
From the ESA’s perspective though,
it’s very different because it’s a deep
space mission, about 500 million
kilometres away. You can only
communicate using extremely large
antennae, which requires dedicated
facilities. The ESA’s are in Australia,
but we also share NASA’s Deep Space
Network.
What challenges are there in
operating an instrument for
Rosetta compared to something in
a lab on earth, or on a satellite in
orbit around the earth?
The earth orbit environment is
usually worse. In deep space, we
mostly have the constant radiation
from the solar wind, but we also
need to deal with occasional solar
flares and very high energy cosmic
rays. On Cluster, a satellite that
"Rosetta
will stay
with the
comet
over a
whole year
as it boils
off dust
and gas."
"We've
seen two
things
that we
weren't
expecting."

role in the Rosetta expedition and just
how hard it is to do science in space
“Everyone thought it was
a bit of a crazy idea.”
