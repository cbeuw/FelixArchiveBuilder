A Lacklustre Show from the Father of Misogyny
If we look up the work
‘Objectification’ in the dictionary,
it will tell us that it describes
“treating a living person as a thing,
with no regard to their dignity”.
It appears that Allen Jones has
misinterpreted this meaning. At
least, that’s how things appear when
entering the retrospective of his work
currently being held at the Royal
Academy, where one is immediately
faced with a semi-naked mannequin,
clad in leather and staring passively
down, supporting a large glass table-
top on her back.
In this piece – Table, from 1969
– Jones has quite literally turned
the female form into an object to
be exploited, abused, and vilified;
it is a theme that runs through
an exhibition that, rather than
championing Jones as the enfant-
terrible of British art, only reveals the
extent of the deep-rooted misogyny
that has permeated his work for the
last 40 years. The curator, Edith
Devaney, has promised that “all
the [opinions on Jones’ work] are
discussed here”, and yet it is difficult
to approach his art in any way that
diminishes its outrageous sexism.
Table forms one third of a group of
sculptures that caused controversy
when exhibited in 1970; the other
two, Hatstand and Chair, follow a
similar theme of turning women into
household objects. Since their debut
they have, unsurprisingly, received a
great deal of attention from feminist
campaigners for their toxicity; the
groundbreaking feminist magazine
Spare Rib suggested that Jones was
terrified of women, and just last week
The Guardian ran a piece entitled
“Is Allen Jones’ sculpture the most
sexist art ever?”. Part of great art is
its ability to shock, and Jones has
expressed his surprise at the outrage
his sculptures caused, saying that
they weren’t intended to shock the
general public, but instead “to shock
Art”, and make a return to figurative
sculpture. It seems a pity that Mr
Jones had to exploit women’s bodies
in order to make his nebulous ‘point’,
and by saying that he was surprised
by the outcry he reveals himself as
either incredibly naive or completely
deceptive.
Part of the problem with Jones’
body of work is that these three
sculptures have dominated all
conversation of his work; in this
article thus far they have already
taken up over 300 words. The rest
of the exhibition, which presents all
of Jones’ oeuvre, tends to fare a little
better as far as offensive material
goes, although his obsession with
deconstructing the female form is
present throughout; in his paintings
from 1966-67, he obsessively draws
disembodied women’s legs, while in
other works women are separated
into mere limbs and torsos, floating
in a colourful void.
Some of Jones’ early work is very
impressive, with his use of colour
standing out as masterful; in one
piece, The Sitter (1966) we have blue
fading into verdant green, which then
becomes crimson against egg-yolk
yellow. His use of tones and hues
are without equal, creating visually
arresting paintings that still look
fresh today, and reveal his links to
American abstract expressionism. It
is a pity then, that the subject matter
remains so bland, with The Sitter
depicting a tableaux in which women
sprawl, legs akimbo, feet stiletto-ed,
fawning in front of disinterested
men. It is especially sad when
compared to his earliest work, such as
his ‘Buses’ series from the early 60’s,
in which he dynamically explores
the limits of both his use of colour,
and the canvas as a physical medium.
These works are fun, dynamic, and
optimistic, which makes it even more
of a pity that his other works are just
rehashes of the same old tropes.
In many of the pictures we see
women either completely naked, in
a state of undress, or constricted in
fetish-wear; a great number of the
paintings feature a ‘man in control’.
This may be a magician, sawing a
glamorous woman in half. It may
be a conductor, wielding a baton of
power. In nearly all the cases the man
is fully dressed, making the woman’s
nakedness even more degrading –
Robin Thicke eat your heart out,
Allen Jones got here first.
All this being said, there are some
stunning works in the gallery. Jones
has spoken about his ‘three languages’
of work: Painting, Sculpture, and
Steel. It is this last medium in which
he comes closest to transcending the
label of sexist that plagues his other
work. Using sheets of brightly painted
metal, Jones has created a series of
couples dancing: over here a foxtrot,
over there a waltz. These pieces
exude confidence, levity, and – well
– sexiness; it is as if the figures have
come straight off the canvas, and
are whirling around the exhibition
space. With their complex spatial
arrangement and sense of jollity,
they are by far the best work in the
retrospective – Naum Gabo with a
Brighton-postcard sensibility.
Entering the final room
extinguishes any joy obtained from
the previous pieces; here, in what
was supposed to be an explosive
culmination of Jones’ work, there
is assembled a ‘chorus-line’ of his
static mannequin work. Dead,
glassy eyes stare out at you from
behind false lashes, giving the whole
ensemble about as much appeal as a
fishmongers. The guide says that the
fine detailing and attention to detail
“affords [these sculptures] status, as
if they should be observed on a stage
or a pedestal”. The only place I can
imaging placing these sculptures is
on the trash heap along with Page 3,
Peter Stringfellow, and everything
else that should have died a death
sometime in the mid-70’s.
Ultimately, Allen Jones, rather than
exalting women, robs them of their
agency. Defenders of his work would
say that Jones is simply making fun
of male sexual desire, and yet the
sheer tenacity with which he returns
to the subject suggests that there is
a deeper obsession with debasing

The long-awaited Allen Jones Retrospective is analysed by Fred Fyles
"We have
a chance
to see all
of Jones'
oeuvre; the
question is
why would
we want to"
Ultimately
Jones,
rather than
exalting
women,
robs them
of their
agency
women that runs straight to his core.
Such subject matter can be used as a
form of female empowerment: just
look at the paintings of artist Ella
Kruglyanskaya, who explores the
female form with a joyous gaze - the
women in her work aren’t powerless;
they are strong, confident, and above
all in control. Jones work doesn’t
compare. Instead it sits alongside the
work of other serial misogynists such
as Mel Ramos, whose work claims
to be subverting the male gaze, but
instead just reinforces it.
Edith Devaney has spoken about
how they decided not to show the
three furniture sculptures together,
since they wanted to take the focus
away from the most well known
pieces, and instead show work that
isn’t usually seen. In that regard
the retrospective is a success, giving
viewer a chance to see the entire
oeuvre of Allen Jones; the question is,
why would they want to? Ultimately
it reveals Jones to be an artist whose
work shows no lack of skill, but a
severe dearth of ideas. Devaney has
lauded Jones’ decision to dress his
sculptures in fetish-wear, since if
he has dressed them in fashions of
the time they would appear dated;
but it is not the clothes that seem
old-fashioned, just the archaic
attitudes towards women that – like
a poisonous mould – colonise every
room of this exhibition.
Allen Jones is on at The Royal
Academy, until 25th
January. Tickets
