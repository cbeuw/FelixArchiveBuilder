Bankers are Wankers: the dark side
of Canary Wharf
“Ihate this time of the year.
It feels like we’re shopping
around careers fairs for
the rest of our lives,” complains
my flatmate, who has changed his
dream job aspiration for the tenth
time in a year. Anyone in their
current penultimate year of study
can relate, as internship application
deadlines loom and marketers at
the aforementioned careers fairs
begin eagerly hounding intimidated
students in order to get their share
of Imperial graduates, the smartest
young adults in the country. By this
time, you’ll have narrowed down the
choice to at perhaps just a few careers
left. Here’s a hint; if front-office
banking is one of them, it’s time to
grab a pen and cleanse your soul by
gouging that option from your head.
The truth is that these certain
jobs are motivated by nothing but
the worst of capitalistic greed and
the desire to proliferate one’s own
personal wealth, with absolutely
no contribution or side-effects to
society. It becomes an even greater
shame when you realise that, like you,
these traders and certain investment
bankers are smart people who simply
chose to further their own social
position in a capitalist society in the
most inconsiderate and detrimental
way possible. (One banker helpfully
proclaimed the enlightening
statement pointing out that they
do, in fact, contribute to society by
paying their taxes.)
You, whether you feel this way right
now whilst still studying at Imperial,
are one of the most intelligent people
in your generation. You are blessed
with enough intellectual capability
and motivation to be able to succeed
and live a comfortable life whatever
you choose to do. We are some of the
luckiest people in the country to be
able to lead by example by having
the ability to succeed in anything
we choose to do. Surely it’s not too
much to expect that we will have
enough courage to put our talents to
use in helping move society forward,
rather than fuelling an ever-growing
chasm caused by genetic-lottery-
discriminatory capitalism?
Will finding your own passions
and turning them into a career you
love be difficult? Certainly. Will is
be harder than your degree? Almost
certainly not. Outside of Imperial,
you will receive immense respect and
prestige just by having studied here,
and this is a foothold you can choose
to use to either get into banking
and waste your life slaving away
for money, or to carve out a story
which will inspire your friends, your
family, your children, and anyone
else who happens to get to know
you. Don’t you want the satisfaction
which comes with doing something
emotionally, socially, or intellectually
rewarding? Don’t you want to live in
a society of altruistic, creative, and
compassionate individuals, all who
have worked their own unique paths
through life?
You should take note that my
arguments are not directed at all
people associated with banks. My
spring internship with Credit Suisse
(CS) did expose the cruel side-effects
of too much capitalism – not what
they intended their programme to
achieve, but it stands that the only
things they were willing to teach the
interns were the apparent reasons CS
is so different to other banks, how
competitive this scheme is, and how
they like to throw around the money
their employees generate for them
(compulsory boat party for week-long
interns; attendance is taken and you
are still observed well into the night
to see how you interact with the other
interns and staff).
The progression from internships
into employment can easily clarify
how shallow these ‘insights’ are;
this year, all of the spring interns
in the investment banking division
were fast-tracked onto the summer
internship, and the conversion rate
is roughly 80% onto the graduate
scheme. Despite all this, I did meet a
bunch of passionate, dedicated people
in the middle and back offices (such
as the IT department) who seemed to
genuinely enjoy their work for what it
is. They are, to some extent, bystander
casualties of the abhorrent greed of
the front office; they now suffer from
the stigma associated from working
for a bank, when in fact only a few
positions in the bank necessarily
attract certain personalities of self-
absorbed, egotistical creatures.
Fortunately for the future, the
species of narcissistic trader will soon
be extinguished by the emerging,
rapidly developing automatic trading
platforms. We can only hope that as
society and the law slowly advance
away from mega-corporations,
the same ruination will fall on the
investment banking divisions and we
will be able to finally proceed with
focussing our priorities of equality
and the universal recognition of the
individual.
Lights blazing into the night: this will become all too familiar. Photo: Mirror
