Marking boycott comes to an
end
After a fortnight of industrial
action, the University and
College Union (UCU) and
Universities UK (UUK) have reached
an agreement on Wednesday to a
series of negotiation meetings.
Through this, UCU and UUK have
jointly agreed to suspend industrial
action (a marking boycott that had
taken place at Universities across the
UK) from the Wednesday onwards.
UCU members had launched the
marking boycott in protest of
proposed pension reforms in the USS,
which would have seen contributions
drop and members’ final pay-outs
dwindle in an attempt to make up a
shortfall in the USS pension pot.
The suspension is to last until after
the next joint negotiating committee
(JNC) meeting scheduled for the 15th
of January, 2015, with the negotiation
meetings that UCU and UUK have
agreed to taking place between now
and then.
In a number of statements on
their website, the UCU states that
“the purpose of these meetings is to
close the differences between the
stakeholders’ negotiating positions,
with a view to reaching agreement.
This will include a meeting between
the respective actuaries of the USS

Trustee Board, UUK and UCU.”
They also say that: “both parties
are pleased that the agreement to
suspend industrial action at this early
stage will mean that students will
not have been adversely affected and
members of staff will not have had
pay deducted.”
This is on the basis that “at this
point, institutions will not have

Imperial deletes tweet after ‘shirtstorm’ backlash
The clothing choice of an
Imperial graduate has been
extensively lambasted in
the wake of the Philae landing, the
culmination of over a decade’s work.
During the days immediately
preceding the comet landing, the
heavily tattooed Dr Matt Taylor, one
of the project scientists, had become
popular as a ‘gangster scientist’,
but came under fire for a press
conference given during the lead-up
to the final landing in which he wore
a printed shirt depicting a number of
scantily clad women.
Imperial College (@imperialcollege)
posted and later deleted a tweet
describing Dr Taylor as a “proper cool
scientist”.
When contacted for comment, a
College spokesperson responded:
“The College regrets that the tweet
included the photo of Dr Taylor used
widely across the media that day.
Those responsible saw a Hawaiian
shirt and did not notice the detail
of the design. We recognise that use
of the image is inconsistent with
the College’s strong commitment
to equality and diversity. Following
concerns raised by members of the
community the tweet was deleted; it
was in the College’s stream for two
hours in total.”
The story trended across Twitter
under the hashtags #shirtgate and
#shirtstorm, polarising discussion
between those who felt that the shirt
was misogynistic and those defending
Dr Taylor.
In the way that many internet
discussions regarding feminism do,
critics were accused of “over-active
feminism”, as well as other more
personal attacks up to and including
death threats.
After the dust settled, the
American Astronomical Society
released statements condemning
the “unacceptable abuse … directed
towards the critics.” The incident has
also sparked a debate concerning the
attitude towards women in STEM
subjects, the shirt being viewed as a
case of casual sexism at the workplace.
Dr Taylor gave a tearful apology on
international media, saying: “I made
a big mistake and I offended many
people and I am very sorry about
this.”
He then went on to provide an
update on Philae’s continuing
progress.
Dr Taylor graduated from Imperial
in 2001 with a PhD in Space Physics,
before joining UCL’s Department of
Space and Climate Physics, where he
was appointed as a project scientist to
the European Space Agency’s Cluster
project.
The shirt in question was made
by Elly Prizeman, a clothing
manufacturer from Chelmsford,
who has since been inundated with
requests for copies of the shirt.
Mrs Prizeman has commented that
she “didn’t expect him to wear it in
the situation he did”.
Ben Howitt reports after College removes tweet about “proper cool scientist”
found it necessary to apply their
policies to withhold pay for the
assessment and marking boycott and
that individual members of staff who
were participating in the industrial
action will have been able to remedy,
within a reasonable time scale, any
backlog of work that actually resulted
from the industrial action between 6
to 20 November.”

New Bitcoin
competition prize fund
The Imperial College Business
School (ICBS) has teamed up
with Entrepreneur First (EF), a
pre-seed investment programme, to
launch a new competition prize fund
for students. Up to £3000 could be
won from the Imperial/EF Bitcoin
Prize Fund for projects that utilise
Blockchain technology, which allows
secure transactions without the need
for a central regulation authority –
how Bitcoin is best described.
The competition is open to entrants
from any department, be they
Undergraduate or Postgraduate.
Students can apply to carry out
projects under the fund either
individually or as a group, with grants
up to £500 available for equipment
funding. They can also arrange for
projects to count as credit towards
degree courses.
Dr Llewellyn Thomas, a researcher
with the Business School, has
emphasized that the aim of the
competition is not the focus of
Bitcoin as a currency. Rather, it
seeks to promote innovations on
Blockchain technology, as the
distributed trust mechanism of the
Blockchain is the truly innovative
aspect of said technology.
This is not Imperial’s first foray
into involvement with Bitcoin/
Blockchain technology. The recently-
launched Bitcoin Forum at Imperial,
which consists of faculty members
across all departments, will be
working with EF to mentor and assist
students entering the competition.
Workshops on entrepreneurship and
presentation skills, regular mixers,
and talks from prestigious figures
in the Bitcoin and business fields
are just a number of things planned
by the Forum and EF for those who
register to take part. The Forum
also hopes to facilitate cross-faculty
partnerships throughout the course
of this competition.
