Aside from the fact that it
makes me feel old (It can’t
have been ten years since the
last one, I remember that coming
out when I was doing my GCSEs...),
I have more problems with Band
Aid and the song, ‘Do They Know
It’s Christmas’ than I can possibly
keep straight. Of course, there’s as
big a difference between a dislike of
the song and the concept as there
is between the concept and the
incarnation. Band Aid 30 represents
a significant modernisation in the
track, which aims to raise money to
tackle the Ebola Crisis, and features
significant changes to the lyrics
compared to the original in 1984,
which raised funds to help counter
the Ethiopian famine.
‘Do They Know It’s Christmas’
has been remade several times over
the past thirty years, with varying
incarnations of Band Aid. Geldof’s
original criterion for selection
of celebrities in Band Aid was
how famous they were. Logically,
inclusion of as many of the most
famous people as possible can only
increase sales, and thus donations
to charity. This can only be a good
thing. But in the latest version, three
faces appeared in the Band Aid group
photo, presumably designed to tap
into a whole new demographic. These
people were Zoë Sugg, Alfie Deyes,
and Joe Sugg, or as they may be more
known to you: Zoella, PointlessBlog,
and ThatcherJoe. These are British
YouTube vloggers, and three of the
most popular ones at that; Zoella
alone has more than 6.5 million
subscribers.
With the primary audience
of YouTube videos being in the
13-17 age range, these names
bring with them a huge group of
dedicated fans to the cause. What is
questionable about the decision to
include them, however, is that they
have no connection to the music
industry, making them the first such
celebrities to participate in Band
Aid. With many young YouTubers
of comparable popularity self-
producing and releasing both original
songs and covers, surely it would have
been a better choice to feature voices
which brought merit to the project?
They were able to contribute only
to the chorus, where their voices are
unheard, thus the only asset that
they bring is promotion in terms
of reaching an audience (that may
already be saturated by the pop
music/1D market) through publicity
and the group photo, where they may
or may not be spotted. Band Aid is a
song, and through choosing instead
an artist such as Carrie Fletcher,
whose popularity on YouTube will
make her voice distinctive to the
huge number of people who know
her, the song itself reaches out of this
group of people, thus achieving its
core purpose.
It seems that instead of considering
the most appropriate youth celebrity
for this demographic, Bob Geldof just
decided that YouTubers seemed like
a good idea, and picked Zoella from
the top of the list of most subscribed.
The other YouTubers featured are
her boyfriend and brother, which
seems more than a little coincidental
– while they are also prominent
YouTubers, I do not doubt that she
helped orchestrate their selection.
While this is, at face value, a good
publicity strategy – reaching out
to the largest possible fan base – it
sacrifices outreach from the music,
where it was not necessary to do
so, reducing its potential impact.
A recognisable voice on the record
will introduce fans of YouTube to
the song in forums other than the
YouTubers themselves talking about
it, where they otherwise would not
have noticed the song, if we to are
assume that such a market has not
already been penetrated. By failing to
audibly include these internet stars,
their contribution is only in publicity
that they themselves generate by
talking about it themselves. It shows
Bob’s lack of understanding of the
way that more and more artists are
using YouTube as a platform to
launch themselves; he is recognising
its impact on a huge number of
people, which would be foolish to
ignore, but not its internal structure.
This is not the only example of Sir
Geldof making seemingly rash and
haphazard decisions with the Band
Aid brand. Anyone familiar with the
songs will know that the lyrics are not

Is Bob Geldof’s Band Aid out of touch?
"... generalising
this even to
the whole of
West Africa
is misleading,
patronising,
and perpetuates
a negative view
of Africa"
necessarily fully sensical. ‘There won’t
be snow in Africa this Christmas
time’ just plain ignores that fact
that Africa is a actually a very large
continent with a very diverse range
of climates, including snow, and ‘Do
they know it’s Christmas time at all?’
blatantly disregards the hundreds
of millions of Christians in Africa
who probably do actually know that
it is Christmas time. This is just one
example of how this song paints
a picture of Africa as a continent
totally unrelatable to the western
world, entirely fraught with suffering
and misery, and ignorant of ‘Western’
festivities such as Christmas.
The latest version of the song,
addressing the Ebola Crisis, becomes:
Where a kiss of love can kill you
Where there’s death in every tear
And the Christmas bells that ring
there
Are the clanging chimes of doom
Well tonight we’re reaching out and
touching you
Bring peace and joy this Christmas to
West Africa
A song of hope where there’s no hope
tonight (ooh)
Why is comfort to be feared,
Why is to touch to be scared
How can they know it’s Christmas
time at all
In much the same way as the whole
of Africa was not desert-parched
and starving during the Ethiopian
famine, the whole of Africa is not
cowering in fear and panicking about
ebola. Africa is a huge continent, and
while the seriousness of this crisis
cannot be denied, it is actually only
affecting a tiny number of countries,
and generalising this even to the
whole of West Africa is misleading,
patronising, and perpetuates a
negative view of Africa as continent
of suffering, rather than a continent
containing many of the fastest-
growing global economies. While
pity does sell, this isn’t necessarily
fair on the people of Africa, or those
who are being taken in and mislead
into buying the single. After all, they
should have a realistic idea of where
their money is going, and who it’s
going to affect.
I should finish by saying that, of
course, this has been produced for
charity. As Bob Geldof says, “It really
doesn’t matter if you don’t like this
song. What you have to do is buy this
thing”. With around 200,000 copies
selling in the first two days, this is the
fastest selling single of 2014, and has
already raised a phenomenal amount
of money to go towards ending
the ebola epidemic. Of course, he’s
right, but while charitable donations
in any form can only help solve
this crisis, it isn’t unreasonable to
expect celebrities who are regularly
involved in charitable activities to
raise the profile of such problems
and Africa in a way which does not
continue negative stereotypes. There
are, of course, other ways to donate
to the Ebola Crisis than by buying
this single, and maybe you should
consider giving to them instead;
aiding without perpetuating the
old-fashioned distorted view that Bob
Geldof seems so intent on continuing.
Bob Geldof may be trying to appeal
to everyone, but both when it comes
to Africa and the music industry, his
ideas are stuck in the past.
