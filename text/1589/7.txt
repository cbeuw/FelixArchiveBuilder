On Wednesday thousands of
student protesters took part
in a march against student
tuition fees. The protests turned
violent when the students reached
Parliament Square.
Signs seen around Parliament
Square included the slogans “books
not bombs” and “free education, tax
the rich”.
Some students were able to dodge
police and push through two sets of
metal barriers in order to gain access
to the square.
Some were also wearing balaclavas
in order to obscure their face. Red
flares were also set off next to the
Houses of Parliament.
19 year old Joe, who refused to
give his last name, said that “David
Cameron is misguided and deluded
because of his sheltered and out of
touch upbringing. It’s his closed
education that has given him his
views not logic.”
Police made eleven arrests in
total and two people were held for
questioning after charging at the
Conservative Party headquarters.
After the protest, the Department
for Business said in a statement:
“We recognise the right of all
students to free speech. However,
the world-renowned calibre of the
UK’s higher education system would
not be sustainable if tuition fees
were removed.”
The Metropolitan Police released a
statement on the matter, which said:
“Various missiles were thrown at the
officers and protesters pulled down
protective fencing around the grass
area in Parliament Square.”
The National Union of Students
(NUS) did not endorse the protest,
and their office was amongst those to
be attacked. Graffiti, including the
word “scabs”, was later found on the
building.
Demonstration organiser Aaron
Kiely, who is a member of the
NUS Executive committee and the
Student Assembly Against Austerity,
said: “We want to end the lifetime of
debt which is a massive burden for
students.”
“Students are really angry because
we go to University and then at
the end of it we get an average of
£40,000-worth of debt.
“That puts you in a hell of a
difficult position when you start to
think about a mortgage and a family.
We need an alternative.”

Funding, as it still in the process of
conducting the Higher Education
Funding Survey. Deputy President
(Education) Pascal Loose said: “The
Union doesn’t have a stance or
policy on this issue yet, however
Student media at Cardiff University
went on strike earlier this following
a decision by the Student Senate
(Cardiff’s version of Union Council)
to force a re-election of Cardiff’s Vice-
President of Media and Marketing.
Cardiff is the only other University
to have a full-time Media Sabbatical
Officer (Imperial being the other).
Like Imperial, the Officer also edits
the student paper,Gair Rhydd, full
time.
The previous Vice-President, Tom
Eden, resigned in late October for
personal reasons. On a statement on
Cardiff University Student Union
(CUSU)’s website, he said: “Having
given my all in the role throughout
the past year and a half, I have
decided that now is the right time to
step down, believing this to be the
best step for me both personally and
professionally.”
The same statement noted that both
Eden, and his team in student media
agreed to keep the role vacant, feeling
that electing a new officer would
lead to undue disruption to both
student media, and the replacement’s
education due having leave their
studies part way through the year.
This view was shared by Elliot
Howells, the president of CUSU, who
said: “It is the feeling of the Sabbatical
Trustees that a by-election is not in
the best interest in the organisation
as a whole at this present time.”
At Senate, a motion was put forward
to leave the position vacant, however
this was rejected by 15 votes to 9.
One Senator, Kate Delaney, wrote on
her blog: “the reason I voted against
this motion is down to democracy
and accessibility”, continuing, “By
allowing someone who is unelected
and accountable to be given the job
[of editing Gair Rhydd] was an issue
for me”.
In response to the rejection of
this motion, all of Cardiff’s media
outlets went on str ike on Sunday
16thNovember, withGair Rhydd’s
staff also threatening to resign en
masse if the election is to go ahead.

Officer Trustees and staff of the
Union were welcome to attend if
they took leave.
“ Of course, if there is an issue that
our members want us to campaign
for, then we encourage them to
bring a paper for discussion to
Union Council or come along to the
General Meeting on 1 December at
18:30.”
The General Meeting will take
place in Blackett Lecture Theatre 1.
Meanwhile, volunteers working in
student media wrote a joint letter to
the Board of Trustees raising their
concerns.
Meanwhile, a petition on the
iPetitions website amassed 764
signatures, with many of the people
who signed the signature being
consumers rather than contributors.
On the 19thNovember, the Board
of Trustees published a statement on
CUSU’s website. In this statement,
they announced that the Board had
quashed Senate’s decision, noting that
keeping the position vacant was in
the best interests of the organisation.
This decision was endorsed by both
the NUS and Cardiff University, and
was made in consultation with legal
advisors.
Student media at Cardiff has
reacted positively to the decision,
with Cardiff’s TV and radio stations
having resumed programming on
Wednesday, andGair Rhydd’s next
issue coming out next week. Michael
O’Connell-Davidson, the Editor
ofGair Rhyddsaid he “couldn’t be
happier” about the decision. Last week's issue of Cardiff University's newspaper. Photo: Gair Rhydd
