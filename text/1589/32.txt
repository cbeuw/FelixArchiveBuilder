A Very Different Type of Selie...

Have we reached ‘Peak Selfie’?
Last year saw the word, used
to describe a self-portrait
cum photograph, chosen as the
Oxford English Dictionary’s ‘Word
of the Year’, which is unsurprising
when one considers its ubiquity
among social media. The Ellen
DeGeneres’ selfie from the 2014
Academy Awards has the honour
of being the most retweeted image
in the world; Instagram has over
50 million picture with the tag
#selfie; and the phenomenon even
has its own theme song – #SELFIE
by The Chainsmokers, a piece of
somewhat dubious quality. Truly,
our society is saturated with the selfie
phenomenon.
However, if you need reminding
that sometimes the best subjects in
photography are other people, you
could do worse than head down to
the National Portrait Gallery, where
the Taylor Wessing Photographic
Portrait Prize, now in its twelfth
iteration, is currently on display.
Showcasing the best photo portraits
taken in the last year, its 4000 entries
have been whittled down to just 60,
from which one has been crowned the
winner.
The names on display here are
varied, from well-established
photographers such as Giles Price,
who shows director Steve McQueen
staring a hole through the lens, to
completely new artists, something
that is surely a direct result of the
fact that all entries are judged blind.
At first glance, it may seem that the
themes explored are equally varied,
but careful viewing reveals a number
of key ideas that the photographers
repeatedly come back to.
One such idea is that of identity,
which should be no surprise –
after all, what is a portrait if not
a form of identification? Mark
Read’s photographs of the Sapeurs
of Brazzaville – Congolese men
who dress as dandies as a form of
resistance against colonialism – are
superb, exploring a topic that has a
real power and resonance in today’s
globalised world; his sapeur is dressed
to the nines, clad in an expensive-
looking suit against a backdrop
of the waterfront of the DRC’s
capital, looking like one of the latest
candidates on The Apprentice.
Elsewhere, Sara Al Obaidly’s
portrait of her young Qatari cousins
perfectly encapsulate the sartorial
drama currently occurring in the
Middle East, where old and new
cultures are clashing like jungle
drums; part of her series Qatar: Old
Hearts, New World, the formal
rigidity of her sitters’ poses is offset
by the bow one of the girls wears in
her hair – branded with the Chanel
logo, it contrasts brilliantly with her
all black ensemble. It forms a perfect
companion piece to Jessica Fulford-
Dobson’s work Skate Girl, which
won second prize in the competition;
in this series, Fulford-Dobson
documented the young Afghan
girls who learn to skate through the
NGO Skateistan. Both challenge the
Western idea of the Middle East,
and question the cultural values
associated with the region.
Elsewhere, the role of artifice
is explored, such as in Catherine
Balet’s reproduction of Diane Arbus
photographs, or Hayley Benoit’s
portrait Jamelia as her mum, Olivia,
in which her friend dons the garbs
of her mother, linking together the
different generations. Her head held
high, mouth creasing into a golden
smile, Jamelia is completely uplifting,
and Benoit’s work is one of the most
optimistic in the gallery.
However, there is a dichotomy
within the collection of photos;
there are those that photograph
their friends, or family, and those
who choose famous individuals
as their subjects. In general, it is
the former that come out on top;
with no pressure to represent a
well-known figure in a certain way,
these photographers have been
able to pierce to the core of their
subjects. A black and white portrait
of a Columbian drag queen, taken by
Viviana Peretti, manages to elegantly
break down notions of gender and
sexuality, like a cross between Irving
Penn and Cindy Sherman; Marcia
Michael photographs her mother
undressing, creating a vision of soft
flesh that transcends the normal
tropes of race and sex; and Sammi
Parkkinen’s portrait of his son, Arvi,
wearing an oversized coat, manages to
be both tender and heartbreaking.
An absolute highlight is Nicholas
Sinclair’s portrait of British artist
Celia Paul, at home in her studio;
set next to a portrait of her sister,
it is a picture within a picture, and
manages to conjure up an atmosphere
of extreme intimacy. The silent
stillness of the picture reflects the
solemnity of the artist’s studio: a
magical, mysterious realm in which
the painter – like a body possessed
– conjures up spirits of creativity,
containing them within the blank
cage of a canvas. It is one of the best
photos in the space, both haunting
and beautiful.
On the other hand, there are
pictures whose subjects are more
interesting than their compositions.
The aforementioned portrait of
Steve McQueen is admittedly
technically accomplished, but says
little about McQueen as a person. Jon
Cartwright’s portrait of Roger Lloyd-
Pack is similarly unimaginative,
resembling a headshot of any
actor that one could see in their
portfolio. However, the award for
the most distressing interpretation
of a celebrity comes from Bert
Verwelius: Maria, which shows a
member of Russian protest group
"Careful
viewing
reveals a
number
of key
ideas that
the artists
explore"
Pussy Riot unmasked, resembles
a portrait of a ballet dancer upon
which an overenthusiastic Photoshop
technician has trained their gaze.
With a panache that would make
Anna Wintour blush, Verwelius has
managed to rob his subject not only
of any individuality, but also her
nose.
This year’s winner, David Titlow,
present us with a photograph of
his infant son, being shown with a
dog the morning after a night-long
midsummer party in Sweden. The
composition is bathed within a
magical light, the kind that can only
be found at a certain time of day, and
resembles nothing short of a classical
Rembrandt. With beer cans instead of
golden cups, septum piercings instead
of golden chains, it is a newfound
masterpiece; an adoration of the magi
for our modern world.
With any exhibition that invites
submissions from the general
population, there will be a mix of
quality; this is certainly the case at
the Taylor Wessing Photographic
Portrait Prize, where inspired
works rub shoulders with the less
imaginative. Ultimately though,
the selection is very well made,
encompassing a myriad of themes:
identity, gender, artifice - they all get
a look in at this show. And if nothing
else, the surrounding spectacle of
Trafalgar Square should provide a
perfect backdrop for a quick selfie.
The Taylor Wessing Photographic
Portrait Prize is on until 22nd February
2015, at the National Portrait Gallery.
