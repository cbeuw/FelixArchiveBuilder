Katniss Everdeen is broken.
Being thrown into the arena
for the Hunger Games twice
in quick succession would be enough
to break anyone. Add in the chaotic
climax of the second round, and it’s
a surprise she’s still going at all: the
collapse of the arena, the revelation
that the rebellion is underway and
spear-headed by the previously lost
District 13, and the crushing reveal
that District 12 – home – is no more.
Small wonder she spends the opening
moments of this, the third film in
the series (and the first part of the
final book – split, predictably, into
two parts), curled up in a corner,
reciting her name, her home, her
participation in the Hunger Games
and her relationship with Peeta over
and over again.
The following two hours chart
Katniss’ attempt to claw back her
sanity, to fight through the extensive
post-traumatic stress disorder and to
keep doing what she has always tried
to do – survive. Survive, and protect
her family. True to the sense of
escalation that was so plain in the first
two films, the stakes for survival are
higher than ever – the rebellion has
begun, districts are in open conflict
with the Capitol, and war has arrived.
No-one is safe. As the Mockingjay,
Katniss is the face of the rebellion, a
figurehead for the districts to rally
behind – but as becomes plain, she is
really just a pawn in someone else’s
game.
Just as her image was manipulated
in The Hunger Games and in
Catching Fire, so too is it twisted here,
to suit the ends of President Coin,
the leader of District 13. The idea
of figureheads, of public perception
and the way propaganda allows the
state to toy with it, is one of the
core concepts running through the
first Mockingjay instalment – one
of many – and it’s one returning
director Francis Lawrence takes great
delight in playing with.
This is very much a film of
concepts, of high ideas and worrying
questions about society and its
darker nature. It’s a trait that stems
from the original books, which were
always wonderfully subversive, and
nowhere was it more evident than the
final book. The decision to split the
films was a predictable one, but what
appears to be a cynical cash grab has
actually worked in the series’ favour.
The doubled run-time gives this first
film room to breathe, to introduce
the key new players and flesh out old
faces, allowing for maximum impact
come the second part’s far-more
action heavy bent.
If that makes it sound like
Mockingjay wanders towards the
Interstellar route of extensive
dialogue that examines the key
themes intensely, then it’s a
misleading sentiment. Mockingjay
manages to weave its themes
delicately into the backdrop of civil
war, finding time for both riotous
action scenes and tongue-in-cheek
mockery of its own marketing
campaign. Admittedly, the lack of
an actual Hunger Games leaves it
with considerably less in the action
stakes than before, but the series has
– at heart – never really been about
the violence. It’s always been about
something more, andMockingjay
marks the point at which it can
finally embrace it.
It’s an opportunity seized with
both hands by all involved, from
the directing Lawrence to the acting
Lawrence, along with the entirety
of the supporting cast. Jennifer
Lawrence continues to prove her
talent, out-doing herself here as the
mentally fragile Katniss, forced into
becoming a symbol of a resistance
she never wanted to start, while
Donald Sutherland as the malevolent
President Snow remains a highlight.
The late, great Phillip Seymour
Hoffman comes to life in this, his
last film, taking his weirdly subdued
Plutarch Heavensbee to far greater
heights, and new cast member Natalie
Dormer continues to prove herself
the queen of supporting actresses.
Josh Hutcherson is finally given
something more complex to toy with,
as Peeta is forced to turn traitor on
TV, becoming the Capitol’s equivalent
of Katniss, a mouthpiece for those
more powerful than himself, and
it’s to his great credit that he pulls it
off. Jeffrey Wright, too, deserves a
mention – his Beetee is turned into a
Hunger Games equivalent of Bond’s
Q, with a gadget-lab sequence to
match.
Combined with the goosebump-
inducing score by James Newton
Howard, which re-uses and
manipulates its familiar motifs into
something even more unsettling, the
cast are universally excellent, selling
every moment of the film – not least
the sheer devastation of the ruined
District 12, the images of which push
the limits of the film’s 12A rating.
Always a series that teetered on
the upper limits of the rating – the
original was deemed a 15 until cuts
were made – Mockingjay continues to
find new ways to stretch the so-called
‘acceptable’, and it’s all the better
for it. This is not a film that pulls
any punches, and nor should it. The
same streak of dry humour evident
in all three films is alive here, but so
is something more – a darkness, an
anger, bubbling up and boiling over.
The Hunger Games series is heading
to its conclusion. The greatest fight
is yet to come, and as Part 1 of
Mockingjay comes to a dramatic,
heart-breaking close, it can’t come
soon enough.
