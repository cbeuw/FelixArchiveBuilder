Maggie Smith is My Old Lady,
or rather, Kevin Kline’s
titular Old Lady. Mathias
Gold (Kline) is an American who
inherits a nice looking apartment
in Paris from his late father. As a
divorced fifty-something with very
little to show for himself, he considers
this to be a new start for him, until
he finds out that the apartment itself
has an unexpected resident and the
French property law that does not
work in his favour in any way; turns
out, he actually needs to pay the
elderly resident, Mathilde (Smith), a
monthly sum of 2,200 Euros, as a part
of a “viager” agreement.
What is advertised as a quirky
comedy involving grown-ups, works
well in the first half or so. The initial
meeting between Kline and Smith hits
all the right notes as they awkwardly
discuss the financial aspect of this
unique situation. “How old are you?”
asks Kline boldly, after discovering
that following the current resident’s
death, the monthly payment will be
no more. It involves Mathias trying
to make as much money as possible,
selling off various bits of furniture
around the house, so that he can get
by, whilst having to constantly butt
heads with not only Mathilde, but also
with her daughter living in the house.
Chloé (Kristin Scott Thomas), whose
hostility towards this unwelcome,
scheming guest serves greatly towards
the film’s comedic intentions, further
demonstrates some great chemistry
the three main actors share.
But then the narrative starts to
take more and more serious turns.
Personal problems from each side
surface and it turns out the three
characters share more things in
common than they first realised.
Recovering alcoholic Mathias has a
lot of personal demons he needs to
deal with, one of them being issues
with his father who he was not at
all close to. He has troubling stories
from his childhood, having witnessed
and gone through things that no
child ever should, and believe it or
not Mathilde is somewhat involved
in Mathias’ troubles. The film has
tonal difficulties trying to balance
the comedy and the drama, but
ultimately with My Old Lady it is a
mix that does not quite work to the
full extent.
The message it wants to convey
is clear. Children of broken homes
can be more damaged than they
are willing to admit, with a more
negative outcome of life and views on
relationships, which is perhaps why
one should think twice before fooling
around with someone you should not,
especially when there are children
involved.
Thomas and Smith provide vibrant
support for the film throughout, but
in the end this is Kline’s show through
and through. He shows an enormous
range of diversity here, in addition
to showing the audience that he is a
more than competent singer.
The film never relies on the use
of flashbacks to convey the pain the
characters are going through. It relies
heavily on actors’ long speeches, them
reminiscing about the tough days
they had. Kline has plenty of these,
and nails every single one of them.
His smooth transition from slapstick,
dorky comedy in the beginning, to the
more grounded, deeply heartbroken
version of his character in the film’s
second half is an impressive one,
and it is through him My Old Lady
manages to resonate emotionally.
An unwise decision of forcing a
love story between the two singles
never sits right. Kline and Thomas
are supposed to connect through their
shared pains of having had a difficult
childhood. Kline’s role is well-
established, but the limited one here
is Thomas’. She is a brilliant actress,
and there are hints of what Chloé
went through living with Mathilde,
but too little time is invested in
the crucial female counterpart to
Mathias, that the attraction the two
of them share, appear more contrived
than anything else.
Everything is deceptively simple.
The atmosphere, the characters, even
the trailer sells this as a light-hearted
romantic comedy. But the reality is
that My Old Lady sets out to delve
a little deeper, exploring themes of
finally growing up, coming to terms
with childhood trauma, and trying to
lead a happy life in spite of the past.

Given the temporary obsession
that swept across the media
over the ‘sexy felon’ Jeremy
Meeks, it would appear that the
scenario of No Good Deed is not at
all an implausible one. A housewife
who is staying home alone whilst
her husband is away playing golf,
is taken aback by a hunky stranger
who appears on her doorstep. After
some initial hesitation, she lets the
man in. And what does she do in
the bathroom? She checks her hair
to see whether she looks okay and
presentable to
But little does she know that this
charismatic man, Colin (Idris Elba),
is in fact an escaped convict, and
the first thing he did after running
away, was to strangle his ex-fiancée to
death. But Terry (Taraji P. Henson),
a mother of two young children who
is lacking passion in her marriage,
welcomes him in out of the goodness
of her heart. There is some harmless
chit-chat, to get to know one another,
and even a hint of a little flirtation.
Terry’s friend Meg (Leslie Bibb) comes
over, who openly advances on the tall,
dark, handsome man.
It spends more than its fair share
of time in setting the scene, and the
promised thrills do not come until
too late. The brooding, tough-looking
Elba certainly succeeds in setting
the tone for things to come. He is
mentally unstable to say the least, and
to have someone like Elba portray
a highly volatile, violent man is a
genius bit of casting. His physically

imposing stature to begin with, is a
threatening presence from the get-go,
and the stark contrast between his
deadly calm delivery of certain lines
and his full-on rage mode are what
keep the narrative exciting.
Despite having the formidable
talent of Elba playing the villain, the
writing and sequence of events that
follow in the film’s more action-
packed part is a let-down. A lot of
what Colin does makes no sense
and is downright idiotic. There
are so many ways out of the sticky
situation he finds himself in, and yet
the man who escapes from prison
has difficulty taking care of a single
mother and her two children. Elba is
of course required to show some flesh,
including a particularly silly shower
scene which, if it were happening
with a female character, feminists
and critics alike would scream
unnecessary, gratuitous nudity.
That Colin makes so many mistakes
works as an advantage for Terry,
played with ferocious determination
by Henson. Her character is
essentially summed up as a mother
doing whatever she can to protect her
family. She mentions that she worked
as a prosecutor, although this little
detail does not add much to the plot.
It all starts heating up in ways you
would expect things to. It is a standard
home invasion thriller, and yes, it
makes the daring move of using two
houses instead of just the traditional
one, but the way the heroine survives
and clings on for dear life offers up
nothing special. Terry is a remarkably
resourceful lady, with so many things
falling exactly into the right place for
her to use as deadly weapons, and she
cheats death many times. In fact, so
does Colin on multiple occasions, but
these characters are required to defy
science and the force of gravity, for
the sake of continuing with the film’s
story.
When Terry starts fighting back is
arguably the most entertaining part
of the film, but it is a shame this is all
crammed into the final few minutes.
Essentially what it boils down to is
two overqualified actors being part of
an underdeveloped thriller, much like
another one of Elba’s film, Obsessed.
