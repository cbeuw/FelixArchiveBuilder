Local Spotlight: Somerset House ice rink
Yung Nam Cheah reviews the rink that rivals the NHM
"Offers an
excellent
view of the
Christmas
tree and
Somerset
House."

There’s nothing more magical
and festive than skating on an
outdoor ice-ring, especially
one with a gorgeous building as
a backdrop. Every November
to January Somerset House is
transformed with marquees, magenta
lighting and a giant Christmas
tree ornate with vibrant baubles,
beckoning you in with alluring
Christmasy vibe and charm.
Each ice skating session lasts an
hour, and it’s best to arrive an hour
early so you can deposit your bag
at the cloakroom to the right of the
Somerset House main entrance. It
costs £1 for two items so make sure
you grab your friend going in. No
dangling items are allowed so make
sure your phone or camera would fit
into your coat pocket!
As a student, you get 50% off
ticket price (which is £14.55) with a
£2 booking fee; however this only
applies to the daylight sessions. It’s
worth the extra money to go when
it’s dark to make the most out of the
festiveness. Having booked a 17:30
time slot, I was pleasantly surprised
that it wasn’t overly crowded, which
was a big plus!
The ice ring is smaller than
expected – but offer an excellent view
of the Christmas tree and Somerset
House. As everyone makes the initial
grip-the-fence round, classical music
played softly mingling with the
delicious scent of mulled wine from
the adjacent restaurant. The lighting
changes periodically from magenta to
snowflake to my favourite crisscross
ice-fracture effect. Personally I find
the music choice peculiar, a mix of
classical with an odd pop song thrown
in. The surface was rather wet and
slippery as well, not ideal for novice
skaters.
Whilst it isn’t the best place to
skate, the great atmosphere and
setting was definitely worth a visit. It
is after all free to wonder in and take
some photos, even if you don’t want
to go to the ice ring.
The story behind Local Spotlight and the London focus
People always associate travelling
with an initial journey that
involves flying,long hours and pre-
planning,at the very least an hour
or so on a coach or train.
However,this isn’t the case.
Travelling can happen anywhere
and all it takes is for you to take a
step outside your house.It can be to
the other side of the city,or to that
corner of the street that you never
been to,it can even be your own
backyard if you think people would
be interested in what’s there!
London is constantly voted
number one destination on
Tripadvisor and there are countless
things to do in the capital.From
roller skating disco to exclusive
Museum exhibitions,London is a
city that never gets boring,unless
you lock yourself at home and never
ventures out.

up events that are happening?
