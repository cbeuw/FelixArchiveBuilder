46 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX

Double Tro
As Rosberg and Hamilton
go head to head one last
time, Felix asks whether
the awarding of double
points in the ﬁnal race is
a good thing.
The world’s premier motorsport
competition descends on the
Yas Marina Circuit in Abu
Dhabi for the final race of the season
in a cloud of anxiety, uncertainty, and
the usual hefty dose of controversy.
The awarding of double points at
the season ending Grand Prix was
announced, among a raft of other
changes, back in early December
2013. The potential for controversy
was always obvious, but it is only now
that we are finding out what the real
implications are.
Following Sebastian Vettel’s
dominant 2013 season, there was
a profound sense that something
needed to change. Romping home
to the title with three races to spare,
the German ended the Formula One
season in every sense but on paper.
F1, like any sport, must carefully
tread the line between honest
competition and entertainment.
No one wants to see artificial
competition for its own sake but,
as the financial struggles of minor
teams come to the fore, it has never
been clearer that F1 needs to do more
to engage with its fans. Three dead
rubber races at the end of the season
do no one any good.
Imagine if the final day of the
Ryder Cup was purely ceremonial,
or Jessica Ennis was so far in front
that she needn’t turn up for the final
events of the Olympic heptathlon.
Yes, the purity and the authenticity
of the sporting contest must be
maintained, but sport has drama
at its very heart. As double points
maintains the possibility that the
result could change, it preserves the
drama for as long as possible.
Without double points, Hamilton
would only have needed podiums
after his win at the Austin Grand
Prix. Given the quality of the car
he is driving, that would be all but
guaranteed. Don’t get me wrong,
I want Lewis Hamilton to win the
title, and there is no doubt in my
mind that he has been the best
driver all year. The very essence of
sport, however, is that, on ‘any given
Sunday’, it is all up for grabs. Make
no mistake, if Lewis loses the title
this weekend, it will not be because of
double points. If Nico Rosberg wins
on Sunday, Lewis will still outclass
him 10-5 in race wins. If he is not
crowned World Champion it will
be down to his poor results early in
the season. Whether those failures
were the fault of the team, the result
of Lewis abusing his car, due to foul
play by Nico, or downright bad
luck, we will never know. But in the
context of double points it is totally
irrelevant. Lewis has been the better
driver all year, but under both points
systems he could still lose this year’s
title. Rules change more frequently
in F1 than any other sport. Success
has always gone to the team that
best adapts. As changes go, this is
relatively minor.
When rugby union introduced
end of season play offs to decide the
title in 2003 Gloucester finished the
regular season a mammoth 15 points
clear, only to lose the final to London
Wasps. They were not pleased.
A decade on and the drama of a
Premiership Final has introduced
new fans to the sport while the season
builds healthily to a resounding
climax. The contrast to an F1 season
could not be more pronounced.
The championship begins with the
intrigue of winter testing, a first
glimpse of the cars and the initial
whispers of who might have top
pace. The first few races come thick
and fast and we quickly establish the
front runners. All too often and all
too quickly the season trails off. One
or two teams become established at
the front and the competition is as
good as over. Mid table outfits turn
their attention to next year’s car and
leave the driver to battle on valiantly
for minor points. As a spectacle it
still has appeal; the glitz and glamour

These iconic events will always hold
a place in the sporting calendar, but
the championship as a whole has lost
its edge. Whether it was Schumacher
driving his Ferrari into the distance
a decade ago or Vettel’s dominance
of recent years, champions soon
became unpopular because races
became boring. Even Jenson Button’s
2009 World Championship is tainted
by the fact that it was essentially
won before the summer break. A
championship that goes to the wire,
such as Hamilton’s 2008 win and
this year’s contest, is better for the
sport and everyone involved in it.
Since 1991, the result of just three
championships would have changed,
an additional three championships
would have gone to the wire and on
those occasions, more drivers would
have been involved in the shootout.
F1 will always have a die-hard
following of motorsport fans and
the backing of the world’s rich and
powerful. In that way its survival is
not under threat. But if it is to truly
thrive and take the place it deserves at
the top table of world sports, then it
must not be afraid to change its ways.
Double points may not be perfect
– it may need tweaking. Perhaps it
could be extended to the last 3 races
to reduce the random element of it,
or a gradual increase over the course
of the season to keep all the teams
engaged. There are options. The big
players in F1 got all the other changes
spot on this season, and they are on to
something here too.
I hope they have the courage to
stick with it.

the equivalent permutations would have been if single points were in use for the race.
