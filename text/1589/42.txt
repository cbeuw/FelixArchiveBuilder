Find 83 drinks hidden in the grid horizontally, verti-
cally or diagonally.
Some are hidden inside another (like CHA in BABY-
CHAM), but these will never be the same kind of drink
(so if you found PINEAPPLE JUICE, then APPLE
JUICE and JUICE wouldn’t count unless you found
them elsewhere in the grid).
All the drinks in the grid of five letters or less are listed
below, but it’s up to you to discover the longer ones.
When all the drinks have been found, the 21 unused
letters, when read left to right from the top row down-
wards, will spell out two cocktails.
Cheers!
