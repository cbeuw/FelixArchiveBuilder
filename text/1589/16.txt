It’s no Razr, but Motorola are back on the map
The Moto 360 is one of the
first Android Wear devices
to launch this year, amongst
the LG G Watch and Samsung Gear
variants. Sporting a round face and
elegant design, it is one of this year’s
most highly desired gadgets. At £199
it’s also one of the more expensive,
but the combination of Google’s
software and Motorola’s hardware
make it the smartwatch to buy.
Let’s start with the specs; the Moto
360 has a 1.5 inch LCD circular
display, with a tiny bit cropped off
to accommodate an ambient light
sensor. It has a resolution of 320x290
pixels and is topped off with Gorilla
Glass 3, meaning that the screen
is tougher and has better viewing
angles. An AMOLED display with a
higher resolution could have been
an improvement, but as it is it’s
more than sufficient for checking
notifications and running most apps.
It has a TI OMAP 3 CPU clocked
at 1GHz, 512MB of RAM and 4GB
storage. There’s also a pedometer,
optical heart rate monitor, dual
microphones and Bluetooth 4.0
connectivity. Powering the device is
a 320 mAh non-removable battery,
which utilises the Qi wireless
charging standard.
With a stainless steel body, gorilla
glass screen and leather strap, the
Moto 360 doesn’t just look like a
wearable piece of technology; it’s also
a fashionable timepiece. Weighing
only 49 grams, it actually feels like a
watch when wearing it on your wrist.
The main body only comes in
black and silver, but it is possible to
buy black, dark grey or light grey
leather straps – all of which are
interchangeable (if you have a jeweler
handy to do it for you). There are also
plans to release metal bands soon.
The watch is quite sizeable though,
coming in at 46mm wide and 11.5mm
thick. It can be off-putting at first, but
it quickly grows on you after regular
use.
The main draw of smartwatches
is the software. Although still in its infancy, Android Wear holds up
well in day-to-day life. Whenever a
notification pops up on your phone,
a smaller version is shown on the
watch. The icons and text are exactly
the same and it’s very easy to respond
to messages by simple dictation. Of
course the speech recognition isn’t
perfect, but it’s good enough for most
tasks such as replying to texts and
performing Google Now queries.
You could also make use of Android
Wear’s voice commands. Writing
notes, checking Calendar and even
personal navigation are just some of
the things you could do right on your
wrist.
There’s also a whole suite of fitness
apps to track your heart rate and the
number of steps you take in a day
amongst other things to optimise
your exercise experience. The heart
rate sensor is quite cool when in
operation; pointing green lasers
at your wrists looking for signs of
life. However, after comparison
with a more professional heart rate
monitor, I found the 360’s readings
to be inconsistent and inaccurate.
Nonetheless, it is good enough for use
as a rough guide.
Despite having an older CPU
setup than its rivals, the 360 runs
very smoothly for the most part.
Navigating the OS and using various
apps proves no problem at all for
the watch. An active display is in
effect, so simply tapping the screen or
pressing the side button will wake the
device. The only issue is that there’s a
bit of lag for the first split second that
the screen is on, but this is only really
noticeable after leaving the watch idle
for a long time.
The battery life of the watch
was very poor initially, barely
scraping twenty-four hours. Since
then Motorola have released an
update that drastically improves
the power usage and it now easily
lasts more than a day. There’s an
ambient screen option that keeps
the display permanently on, which
would obviously drain more battery.
However, since the screen just
lights up when you raise your wrist
naturally, I haven’t noticed any
benefit to this. Even if one’s usage
of the watch drains the power quite
quickly, the benefit of a small battery
is that it can charge up very quickly –
depleted to full in less than an hour.
There’s a lot of interesting
technology in it, but the Moto 360
is still mainly a watch. It’s been
designed with that mantra and it’s
great that there’s a huge variety of
customisation that can be done to the
watch face. The beauty of Android
Wear is that you can download
a simple app that lets you put on
whatever watch face you want. Be it
analogue or digital, there’s always
some design that will suit you. Even
when charging on the wireless dock, it
acts as a minimalist bedside clock.
Overall, the Moto 360 is a solid
piece of technology. It takes voice
commands well, the screen is
colourful and the OS is mostly
responsive. It packs many features
whilst also managing to last more
than a day on a single charge.
Granted, there are a few issues
with the watch, but I’ve never felt
dissatisfied wearing it.
To conclude, when judged on
its own merit, the Moto 360 is a
wonderful device that serves as a great
extension to any Android owner.
