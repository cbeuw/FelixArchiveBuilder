Have you ever been left
needing your art fix half way
through a day of mindlessly
dull lectures? Well look no further
than this guide, my Lunchtime Guide
to Art, which tells you about all the
amazing galleries and museums that
are on offer within a stone’s throw of
Imperial’s South Kensington campus.
And it is quite extraordinary; I can’t
imagine there are many universities
where you can walk five minutes
down the road, see one of the world’s
best art collections and still be back
in time for lectures to start again an
hour later.
Imperial College Blyth
Gallery
Tucked away and thus often missed
is our very own art gallery, an
idyll of tranquility away from the
hubbub of university life below. The
Blyth Gallery on the 5th
Floor of
the Sherfield Building is the perfect
respite, even just for a fifteen-minute
detour from your lecture schedule.
Free and open 9am ‘til 9pm seven
days a week, you can really visit
whenever you want. From Ritual to
Romance, a new solo exhibition by
artist Chris Shaw runs from 27th
November to 8th
January and shall
display a rich melding of symbolism
old and new, putting ancient imagery
in the context of our popular culture;
it’s sure to be exciting and maybe
even a bit provocative.
Natural History Museum
It is hard not to be aware of the huge
brute of a building at the end of our
sacred Exhibition Road, the National
History Museum. Although more
thought of for its earthquake
simulator than its exhibition space,
the Museum does run a wonderful
annual photography competition.
Now in its 50th year, the Wildlife
Photographer of the Year prize, which
runs until 30th
August, 2015, is
truly a celebration of the beauty
of our natural world, altering our
perspective on the narratives of
certain species through the use of
breathtaking photography. Although
not free like some of the others (£6.30
for a student), I would still thoroughly
recommend it. Open daily 10.00-17.15
Royal Geographic Society
Often forgotten about in favour
of its more famous cousins down
the other end of Exhibition Road,
the Royal Geographic Society
is a wonderful institution and
regularly holds exhibitions that
combine art with a sense of travel
or exploration. Such a show is
starting on 1st
December – India’s
Disappearing Railways – which runs
until 9th
January; a free retrospective
of Australian photographer Angus
McDonald’s final works, it explores
how the Indian railway system is
slowly disappearing as the country
modernizes and how this change will
affect all the people who rely on it
for their livelihood, a beautiful and
moving collection of photos.
Christie’s Auction House
A slightly more unusual option
for lunchtime art is the Christie’s
Auction House on Old Brompton
Road. Experience the glamour of the
art market for free by going to one
of their auctions or alternatively
just a viewing on what is for sale in
the coming days. You may not have
heard of any of the artists on show
(all the big name sales happen at their
Mayfair branch) but a visit here will
certainly give you a sense of an aspect
of the art world that you are not
usually exposed to.
However, it’s still probably
going to be out of your price range
unless you’ve got a few thousand
pounds knocking about! Upcoming
auctions include one of British
pre-Raphaelite and Impressionist
art on 26th
November and one on
British watercolour on 2nd
December,
with viewings of the works on the
preceding days for both.
Cadogan Contemporary
Gallery
Right next door to Christie’s is one
of South Kensington’s few private
art galleries. Free as ever, it is
exhibiting, from 17th November to
3rd December, Janette Kerr’s New
Work from the Sea, a Turner-esque
collection of swirling seascapes,
full of energy and vitality – a great
opportunity to discover a less known
but no less exquisite artist. Open Mon-
Fri 10.00-18.00, Sat 11.00-18.00
Michael Hoppen Gallery
Another free private gallery, this
time just off King’s Road on Jubilee
Place, the Michael Hoppen Gallery
is currently showing the work of
Japanese artist Sohei Nishino, New
Dioramas. Running until 7th
January,
the show builds off Nishino’s
previous success with his New York
and London dioramas to create ones
of other great cities, Berlin, Rio and
Tokyo to name a few. In a mixture of
photography and cartography, the
dioramas are not meant to give you
a geographically accurate depiction
but portray the sense of a place, its
personality, its quirks, its beauty.
Nishino spends months in these
cities, exploring them to gain a sense
of their unique features. Then he
photographs them, meticulously
constructing a patchwork collage that
leaves you utterly immersed in this
unorthodox but enlightened way of
portraying places. Wonderful! Open
Mon-Fri 09.30-18.00, Sat 10.30-17.00
Saatchi Gallery
About a 20 minute walk from campus
is the famous Saatchi Gallery,
located at the Sloane Square end
of Kings Road. With free entry
to all exhibitions as well as free
membership and all associated perks,
the gallery is definitely worth a visit.
An upcoming show that I am very
much looking forward to is Post Pop:
East Meets West (26th
November, 2014
– 23rd
February, 2015), which explores
the impact the influential but deeply
consumerist Pop Art movement had
on the Communist countries of the
East, such as the USSR and China,
with surprising and often strikingly
beautiful effect, an effect that is still
being felt to this day. Open every day
10.00-18.00
Victoria and Albert Museum
The V&A really is the artistic crown
jewels of the area and if I were to
advise you to go to only one of these
art spaces, I would recommend this
one. Opposite the Natural History
Museum on Exhibition Road, it has
an awesome collection of artefacts
from all around the world, whether
you’re interested in Chinese, Indian
or some other country’s art. It also
has some cracking exhibitions on at
the moment: Wedding Dresses 1775-
2014 (Until 15th
March) tracing the
history of this most iconic piece of
fashion and Constable: The Making of a
Master (Until 11th
January) examining
Constable’s groundbreaking new take
on landscape painting, to name but
two. And whilst you do have to pay
for entry to the special exhibitions,
there’s enough free stuff in the
permanent collection to keep you
busy for days on end! Open daily
10.00-17.45 (until 22.00 on Fridays)
Royal College of Art
Located just behind Beit Quad, right
next to the Royal Albert Hall, is the
Royal College of Art, a prestigious
art and design college that often holds
exhibitions that reveals some of the
great art and artists to pass through
its hallways.
One such exhibition, running until
22nd December, is GraphicsRCA:
Fifty Years and Beyond, a look back at
the role the college has played in the
modern history of graphic design.
Both free and wonderfully creative,
the show explores how graphics has
changed and is still changing in the
present as we move into a digitized
world. Just as a previous show in
1963 looked at the emergence of
modernism in graphic design, this
exhibit of some rarely seen works
A Lunchtime Guide to Art
Kamil McClelland looks at what’s on offer around Imperial
gives you a sense of the field’s
evolution and how it promises to
change in the future.
Serpentine Gallery
It is quite possible that you have
already stumbled across the
gallery by accident. Tucked away
in Hyde Park only minutes from
campus, the Serpentine Gallery is
a wonderful celebration of modern
art and has often been crucial in
establishing artists in this country.
It is also famous for the pavilions
it commissions, inviting acclaimed
artists and architects from around
the world to create a temporary space
that can act as an intimate work that
the public can engage with.
Notable shows on at the moment
include a display of German artist
Reiner Ruthenbeck’s geometric
sculptures and Argentinian artist
Julio le Parc’s first UK show. And if
you’re not spoilt enough, it’s also,
like so many other things around
Imperial, free! Open Tue-Sun 10.00-
18.00
So there you go, all the lovely
things that South Kensington has
to offer for art. But make sure to
enjoy responsibly, I don’t want to
be to blame for you missing lectures
because you’re so taken up to all this
great art.
