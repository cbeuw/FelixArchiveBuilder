Last Saturday, the Imperial
Falcons achieved a draw and a
win against the UCL Capitals in
their first home games of the season.
Despite coming from behind in both
games, Imperial managed to clinch
the double header, thanks largely to
some excellent batting and fielding
by some of the newcomers to the
club.
Imperial went behind early in
game one, as the Falcons shipped
two runs in the first innings. The
game had to be paused until third-
baseman Zayd Al-Haddad stopped
bleeding everywhere, before pitcher
Ben Hollis managed to knuckle
down and strike out the final two
batters to retire the side. Imperial
came back strongly though, as
their first six batters all got on base
(including hits by captain Ashley
Ng and rookie Zak Meddings), and
shortstop Edoardo Lisi came round
to score. Unfortunately though, two
players were caught stealing by the
strong arm of UCL’s loud-mouthed
American catcher (despite being
slightly drunk).
Ben continued to pitch into the
second innings, giving up two runs
but striking out UCL’s final batter, as
well as hitting UCL’s catcher for the
second time in successive innings.
In the bottom of the 2nd inning, the
Imperial bats really got going – the
first four batters got on base, and all
came round to score. Tempers flared
later on in the inning though, after
a collision between Zak (who got
on third after an excellent double)
and the UCL catcher. Despite a
heated exchange, no punches were
thrown, and the game carried on with
Imperial leading 5-4 going into the
final inning.
After some strong pitching by
reliever Zack Wang, the game was tied
at five going into the final inning.
Imperial needed only one run to walk
off with the victory. Unfortunately,
the first two Imperial hitters struck
out, leaving it to Edoardo to seize
the win. It was not to be, however, as
the Falcons batter grounded out to
second base to end the game 5-5.
The second game did not start well
for the Falcons – despite Imperial
scoring in the first innings, pitcher
Ashley Ng gave up five runs for
only one out (a fly ball by someone
called “Neon Shorts”, according to
the score sheet), until the mercy rule
kicked in and the Imperial Falcons
were once again up to bat. The
scoring then largely dried up for
the next couple of innings, (apart
from a run from Howard Kwok in
the second) after some tight fielding
and some excellent pitching by
Falcons ace Edoardo (channelling
Madison Bumgarner by pitching in
relief despite being the best pitcher
we have). Imperial’s solid defence
quietened the watching UCL reserves,
along with the driving rain and the
fact that the Steve the Catcher’s
hangover seemed to have kicked in.
At 5-3 down in the top of the fourth
inning, the Imperial bats opened up
and the runs started flowing. After
hits by Edoardo, Zack, Zak and
Jacques Smith, Imperial scored four
runs to take a two-run lead into the
bottom of the fourth inning. One
run and one out later (a great stop
by short-stop Vincent Li followed
by a great tag by first-baseman
Chris Carter), UCL had runners on
first and second, and the situation
looked nervous for the Falcons. The
UCL batter then hit a line-drive
that seemed destined for left field,
until Vincent leapt up to make the
catch. Realising that the runner had
gone, Vincent threw to Rhys Jones
at second base to end the game, with
Imperial running out 7-6 winners.
Congratulations on the whole
team for the victory, and for staying
positive despite the dire conditions.
The team showed great mentality
in coming from behind . Special
mention to all of the new players,
Zayd Al-Haddad, Catherine Ding, Zak
Meddings and Ben Sharpless, all of
whom made crucial contributions on
both games.
Last week Novak Djokovic won
his third consecutive ATP
World Tour Finals title whilst
also in the process securing the World
Number One ranking for the year.
Apart from a minor (and temporary)
blip against Japanese player Kei
Nishikori in the semi-final, Djokovic
swept aside all those in his way with
disdain.
The same could be said of his
opponent in the final. Roger Federer
mercilessly destroyed his opponents
in the round robin, including British
hope Andy Murray 6-0 6-1, before
squeaking past compatriot Stanislas
Wawrinka in the semi-final.
But then disaster struck, as Federer
was forced to pull out of the final with
a back injury. As a result, London was
denied the match that it had patiently
waited a week for. This does raise a
pertinent question. Given the one-
sided nature of almost all the other
matches in the tournament, has what
was traditionally called the ‘Big Four’
now become a ‘Big Two’?
For those of you who don’t know,
tennis’ traditional ‘Big Four’ did
consist of Novak Djokovic, Roger
Federer, Rafael Nadal and Andy
Murray. However, in the last year
Andy Murray has fallen down
the rankings (although this could
arguably be attributed to the back
surgery that he opted to have late last
year).
Having said that, Andy Murray had
won three of the five tournaments
he played in in the weeks leading
up to the final showdown. But that
form was nowhere to be seen once he
entered the arena for his match with
Roger Federer. Federer dispatched
Murray in just 56 minutes. A crowd
of 16000 watched in shock as a
traditionally close match became
painfully embarrassing for the
former World Number Two. It
capped a tough year for Murray, as he
failed to win a single match against
Federer, Djokovic and Nadal.
Some would say that it is harsh
on Rafael Nadal to say that he can
no longer be included in the very
top bracket of players. The case for
Nadal is strengthened when it is
considered that he reached the final
of the Australian Open, where he lost
to Wawrinka (although he did suffer
an injury during the match), and won
the French Open. But the statistics
since the Roland Garros do not make
pretty reading for Nadal. He has not
made a final since Paris in May, let
alone win a tournament. This should
be qualified with the fact that he was
absent from the US Open and the
ATP World Tour Finals with injury.
But would that actually have made
a difference?
Since winning the US Open in 2013,
Nadal has only beaten Djokovic once
– in the French Open Final this year.
He was even beaten by Djokovic on
clay in Rome, a tournament he was
won seven times in the last ten years.
Andy Murray’s stats against Djokovic
and Federer are even less favourable.
Murray hasn’t beaten Federer since
January 2013, and hasn’t won a set
against him since January this year.
Against Djokovic, Murray hasn’t
won since his fabled triumph at
Wimbledon in 2013. He won a set
against him at the US Open this year,
but that remains his only set since
that game at Wimbledon.
But what about the chasing pack?
Have Stanislas Wawrinka, or Kei
Nishikori (the two semi-finalists from
last week) bridged the gap enough to
be considered genuine contenders
against the might of Federer and
Djokovic? The statistics suggest that
they haven’t yet. Wawrinka pushed
Federer close last week, but Nishikori
struggled against him. Wawrinka was
mercilessly destroyed by Djokovic
in a haphazard performance last
Wednesday.
Their head to head records also
seem to agree with this. Wawrinka
has only beaten Djokovic once since
2006, whilst he has only toppled
Federer twice in his career. Both
matches were on clay as well, easily
Federer’s worst surface. Nishikori’s
record against Federer and Djokovic
is slightly more favourable, as he is
only behind 3-2 on a head to head
with each of them.
The bottom line? Through injuries
to others Djokovic and Federer do
seem to have pulled away from the
pack. Whether Nadal and Murray can
catch them back up will depend on
how they recover from their injuries.
Wawrinka and Nishikori would
appear to be nearest to Djokovic and
Federer at the moment.
The tennis world will be hoping that
these two can bridge the gap before
Federer retires, as otherwise we may
be faced with a ‘Big Two’ becoming
just the ‘Big One’.
