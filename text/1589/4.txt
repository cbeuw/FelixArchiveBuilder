Imperial Bursaries: how much will
students have in their pockets now?
Philippa Skett investigates the recent “Anti-Robin Hood” bursary change
It was announced in Union
Council last week that the
bursary scheme for new entrants
starting in Autumn 2016 was to
change. It has altered to decrease
funding for those from lower-
income households and funding to
increase for those students from
households who have slightly more
money.
The decision, made by the Provost
Board at the end of October, was
made to alleviate the financial
pressures of those that come from
higher income families but may not
have guaranteed financial support.
Bursaries are awarded to Home
students only, and are paid for
directly by the College, alongside
the grants and loans on offer from
the UK Government. Only the loans
have to be repaid; the grants and
bursaries go straight into the pockets
of the students, and they don’t have
to pay it back at a later date.
The Union Council quickly
moved to “condemn” the decision,
and College was quick to respond
as to why they made the changes.
College secretary & Registrar John
Neilson spoke to Felix to explain the
decision.
Said Neilson: “In the summer the
previous team of Union sabbatical
officers had prepared a thoughtful
paper suggesting that students who
come from households just higher
than the lowest income bandings
were facing the hardest time
financially at Imperial.
“The last Provost’s Board
considered the package of bursary
support to be made available to
home undergraduates starting in
autumn 2016. We were keen to
make the substantial sum available
for such bursaries (some £7.7m) as
useful as possible to students.”
Further concerns were raised
over current Union President Tom
Wheeler having only been granted
a small window of time to consult
students. The decision was made
during the second half of October,
with Tom Wheeler being given the
“go-ahead” to survey students the
scheme from the 16th. By the 31st,
the Provost Board had met and
decided on the scheme, which was
then presented to Union Council
in Wheeler’s paper on the 11th
November.
When Felix asked directly as
to why Imperial College Union’s
consultation framework wasn’t used
to make the decision, all that College
said was that: “In the time available
before the new undergraduate
prospectus was finalised there was
time to gather very wide range of
views from students.
“It should be noted that the
changes will not affect current
students; they will apply to new
entrants from 2016-17.”
Wheeler did endeavour to consult
those students who currently are
in attendance at Imperial, despite
such a decision not affecting them.
Wheeler surveyed 320 students, held
a discussion forum and also emailed
those who received bursaries directly
to gather their views. In the survey,
he queried whether current students
who receive bursaries feel they get
enough money to live on, and any
other sources of income students
may have.
With 73% of respondents saying
that they found the money they
received to be adequate, good or very
good, many seemed to be happy with
the current bursary scheme.
However some students who were
surveyed did point out that although
household income indicates the
amount of money they receive as
loans, grants and bursaries, parents
are often unable to make up the
difference in money needed for
students to live on. Students from
the higher income brackets were
more likely to feel they did not
receive enough financial support as
a whole, something the College has
appeared to address with an increase
in funding for these students in
particular.
In a report to the Provost Board,
Tom stated that: “Our immediate
reaction to this proposal was concern
that reducing income for the poorest
students would lead to unnecessary
hardship, and would not be the most
efficient use of College’s resources.”
The report continued: We are
