Guerilla Girls: The Male Gaze

Fred Fyles selects a powerful work from W. Eugene Smith
"Men look
at women.
Women
watch
themselves
being
looked at"
"Art
became
little
more than
titillating
the man in
power"
In 1984, the Museum of Modern
Art in New York opened a new
exhibition: ‘An International
Survey of Recent Painting and
Sculpture’. it promised to be a
survey of the most important artists
currently working in the art world.
Not everyone was impressed. Out
of the 169 works featured, only 13
were by women artists, a fact that was
not helped by the curator, Kynaston
McShine, saying that any artist not in
the show should rethink his career. In
1985, one year after the show opened,
the Guerrilla Girls were formed by
seven women artists. And the rest, as
they say, is history.
Their most famous work is
immediately arresting; on a yellow
background, bold black text screams:
“Do women have to be naked to get
into the Met Museum? Less than
5% of the artists in the Modern Art
Sections are women, but 85% of the
nudes are female”. Offset with an
image of Ingres’ painting La Grande
Odalisque, where the woman’s head
has been replaced with a gorilla,
their statement is immediately clear;
women are under-represented in art
galleries, except where they are the
subject of the Male Gaze.
The Male Gaze was coined by
feminist film-theorist Laura Mulvey,
who saw it as a power structure
between the sexes; with heterosexual
men in control of the palette, the
camera, the chisel, many works of
art became little more than a means
of titillating the man in power. In
effect, most works of art put us in
the perspective of a straight man,
making the woman a sexual object.
This is apparent throughout all of
art history; one only needs to go and
look at the key painters of yore, and
their key themes; for Rubens, Titian,
Velazquez, the female nude was a
near-obsession.
Since Mulvey, this idea has taken
on a life of its own. John Berger,
writing in Ways of Seeing, says that
it infiltrates how men and women
appear in society: “Men look at
women. Women watch themselves
being looked at”. In art, the woman
is always aware of being the subject
of the Male Gaze, and in Renaissance
painting, would often be portrayed
staring into a mirror, admiring
herself as an object of adoration.
While the Male Gaze may be
the most famous example of the
phenomenon of the ‘Gaze’, it is by no
means the only form. It can be traced
back to French psychoanalyst Jacques
Lacan, who defined it as the state
that comes with awareness that one
is an object to be viewed. From this
somewhat nebulous definition, more
and more academic disciplines have
sprung up.
We have Foucault’s Medical Gaze,
where the patient becomes ‘a mere
text through which disease can be
read’; there is the Colonial Gaze,
which describes how the privileged
majority place that which is ‘foreign’
into the category of Other; and there
is even the Female Gaze, which shows
such as True Blood could be seen to
use.
When those seven artist friends
got together in 1985, they probably
had little idea how much they would
shock the art world. Taking on the
names of dead women artists such
as Käthe Kollwitz, they set out to
challenge the status quo of the day.
While things have gotten better, they
still aren’t perfect: women are still
underrepresented in the arts, both in
the market and the gallery. The work
of the Guerrilla Girls thus continues,
and will carry on until the Male Gaze
has been replaced with a much more
even sight.

Too Many Firsts by Riyadh Rateme
This week is the Gaze Issue,where we
look at how we look.How do we view
the world? How does it affect our
experience of art?
First of all,Fred Fyles gazes at the
Guerilla Girls,the group famous for
bringing to light the sexism intrinsic
in art,the art market and in how we
view the world in general.Read this
article.You should know about them
and this bias in art.It will change
your visits to art galleries forever.
And how perfectly illustrated was
the Guerilla Girls’message by the
Allen Jones Retrospective,an awful
exhibition currently on at the Royal
Academy? Once again,Fred picks
apart this misogyny dressed as‘art’.
Next Fred visited The Taylor Wessing
Photographic Portrait Prize at
the National Portrait Gallery and
examines how deeply‘selies’have
iniltrated into our culture.
Glare at the Royal Opera House is
praised by Kamil McClelland as a
promising insight into the where
opera could go in the future,Fred
looks at FarAway at the Young Vic,a
short but sweet play that manages to
tackle complex issues of repression.
LunchtimeArt will hopefully be
useful to you guys.Created by Kamil
as a guide to art around Imperial,it
will hopefully provide you with yet
another excuse to explore the South
Ken area in your lunch break.
Finally,Fred and Clara review A
MidsummerNight’sDream and
Accolade respectively,old productions
reimagined with a different eye to
brilliant effect.
So that’s this week! We hope
you enjoy it and we hope you
look forward to next week: The
Transformation Issue.
