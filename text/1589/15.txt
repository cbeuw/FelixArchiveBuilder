It’s the space mission that has had
both scientists and members of
the wider public waiting with
baited breath. The Rosetta mission
has been a nail-biter of a ride since
the awakening of the craft back in
January, and has left news rooms
and control rooms alike buzzing
all through summer as the craft
approached its final destination that
it’s taken ten years to reach.
Beginning its journey in March
2004, Rosetta launched from French
Guinea and took to the skies, skating
around the planets of the Solar
System and finally dropping into a
deep sleep to conserve energy in 2011.
Named after the Rosetta Stone, the
archaeological relic that allowed for
deciphering of the hieroglyphics,
scientists hoped that the spacecraft
would help unravel the mysteries
surrounding comet composition, and
discover more about the origins and
evolutions of the solar system.
Rosetta targeted 67P, a comet that
completes an orbit of the sun every
6.45 years and rotates every 12.4
hours through its axis. Shaped like
a roughly hewn dung bell, it has two
rotund protrusions that extend away
from each other and is roughly 4km
wide and long at its widest points.
Samples taken from the comet show
that it might actually have been
two separate comets at one point
that have fused together, as each
protrusion has its own separate core.
Rosetta reawakened back in
January, much to the anticipation of
the team back at home and the rest
of the world waiting eagerly for news
from the spacecraft. When the signals
were sent back to the European
Space Agency after several hours of
agonising wait, the world erupted in
excitement, although it still seemed
that the odds were against this tiny
craft flying millions of miles away in
space.
At the time, scientists were still
staying realistic and weren’t ruling
out failure just yet. Said Paolo Ferri,
the head of missions operations
at ESA: “There is a possibility that
we’re not going to hear anything.
Two-and-a-half years are a long time.
We’re talking about sophisticated
electronics and mechanics. We’ve
taken all possible precautions for
this not to happen but of course we
cannot exclude that problems may
have happened.”
Fortunately, everything went
smoothly from the hibernation
reawakening onwards. Rosetta was
able to approach the comet, descend
close to its surface, then finally
deploy its landing probe, known as
Philae. Around the size of a fridge,
Philae boasts sampling and recording
equipment, including a drill to take
samples from the surface and a
camera to take photos.
The only hitch occurred when
Philae bounced upon impact when
dropped onto the comet. Philae
bounced twice across the surface of
the space rock, and then came to rest
at an angle, with solar panels hidden
from the sun. It is thought that the
surface of the comet was so dense
that the hooks of Philae were unable
to anchor it sufficiently enough to
prevent it moving further.
Despite sunlight hitting the
panels for only 90 minutes every
12 hours, all 10 of the instruments
on board managed to collect data.
Temperatures were taken, photos
were captured and a small sample was
taken from the surface of the comet
and analysed.
Philae struggled on for 64 hours
before its batteries gave out, and
“Shh... Philae is fast asleep.”
Philippa Skett recaps the Rosetta mission and the future of Philae
it now lies dormant, riding the
comet around the solar system as it
approaches the sun. The team back at
ESA have managed to reposition the
probe so that one of its solar panels is
facing upwards and has the potential
to be reactivated once closer to the
sun. It may come alive once more
and send further information back
to earth, but already the mission is
considered a major success.
The final message from the official
Philae Twitter account simply said:
“I’ll tell you more about my new
home, comet 67P soon ... zzzzz.”
But why hunt down comets? As
they have been flying around since
the start of the solar system, they are
almost like flying time capsules; they
usually haven’t changed in 4.6 billion
years. They sweep up molecules in
their dusty atmospheres and hold
onto them as they spin around the
solar system, forming a cosmological
scrapbook of all the debris that has
been flying around space since the
birth of the solar system.
Latest news from ESA confirms
that Philae has detected organic
molecules on the surface of 67P,
which are now being analysed to see
how complex they are. Although
Rosetta has already detected
ammonia, methane, methanol and
even formaldehyde in the coma – the
gases that surround the comet – the
dream was to discover amino acids,
the building blocks of proteins and all
lifeforms on Earth.
Said Dr Matt Taylor, one of ESA’s
Rosetta project scientists: “the data
collected by Philae and Rosetta is set
to make this mission a game-changer
in cometary science.”
Rosetta will continue to follow the
comet as it approaches the sun, so the
story doesn’t end here. Rosetta will
approach the surface of the comet
itself in the future, which might give
us another opportunity to learn any
other secrets 67P may be hiding. For
now, all we do is wait.
2nd March 2004
Rosetta launches on an Ariane

Guiana.
4th March 2005
Rosetta executes its irst fly-by
back towards the Earth,and is so
close that amateur astronomers
are able to capture it on ilm.

Rosetta captures images of the
collision between comet Tempel 1
and another spacecraft,known as
Deep Impact.
