Foodie Insight #02: Why I’m Vegetarian

Or at least, he tries to be! Kamil McClelland discusses *THAT* lifestyle choice
"There is
actually a
universe
of food
out there
ready and
waiting to be
explored"
"...massive
deforestation
is taking
place across
the world to
create space
for cattle
farms"
As the joke goes: “How do you
know if someone is vegan? Oh
don’t worry, they’ll tell you”.
A lot of people, including myself, are
put off by these militant activists,
encamped on their moral high
ground looking disdainfully down at
the rest of us.
In this article, I have instead tried
to take a more moderate standpoint,
stressing the practical benefits of
vegetarianism as opposed to the
highly charged moral arguments.
Although such arguments did play
an important role in my decision
to become vegetarian, I am more
interested here in demystifying
vegetarianism for you, simply putting
my reasoning out there in order to
fuel greater discussion and so that
you can reflect on your own culinary
decisions.
I haven’t always been vegetarian,
mind you. In fact, it was only when I
came to Imperial and started having
to cook for myself that I made the
switch. It had been on my mind for a
while but this greater control of my
diet was the trigger to change. And
it was not a decision I made lightly;
I still love meat! However, when I
got used to being vegetarian, these
cravings for meat slowly disappeared
and now barely register.
So, here are the reasons why I am
vegetarian:
It’s super healthy and you
can still get plenty of protein
So long as you are getting all of
your vital vitamins and are eating
a balanced diet, being vegetarian is
objectively better for you, reducing
your risk of cardiovascular disease
and some cancers.
‘But vegetarian food is so
unappetising!’ If you feel a meal must
be based around a piece of meat, you’d
understandably be disappointed
by vegetarian offerings; a rather
insipid Portobello mushroom is
never going to match up to a lovely
fillet steak! But this needn’t be the
case and if you look at cuisines where
vegetarianism is better established,
such as with Indian food, you will find
a sensational diversity of flavours and
textures, ensuring that you will never
get bored.
‘What about your protein?’ This is
a common misnomer, with some of
the most energy dense foods being
vegetarian, such as soy and eggs.
Also, some of the protein-rich meat
substitutes, such as Quorn, I find to
taste a lot better than the real thing,
especially the mince.
So vegetarian food is not all
doom and gloom, there is actually a
universe of food out there ready and
waiting to be explored.
It is easier to prepare and
cook
Whereas with meat, you are
constantly worrying whether you
have properly cleaned your chopping
board or thoroughly cooked the
meat, it doesn’t really matter with
vegetables. It’s perfect if you’re quite
a lazy cook and just want something
to fill you up as it doesn’t matter if
you over or undercook it, just throw it
in a wok for a couple of minutes and
you’ve got a delicious meal.
It’s cheap, perfect for
students
Unless you’re buying some Lidl
assorted meats, going vegetarian is
a lot cheaper. This is very noticeable
over the course of the year and as
long as you’re buying in season and
not going for organic, you will have
plenty of money left over for going
out to fancy restaurants, it’s great!
By not allowing yourself to
eat meat, you develop real
mental strength
This is a great way to test your
resolve and develop a skill that is
transferrable to all aspects of your
life: mind over matter. If every time
you are about to buy meat, you stop
yourself, you will soon no longer need
meat to be able to function. Just like
any addiction, it requires strength of
character to overcome.
Now onto some of the more
serious reasons, which, for me, form
the real backbone of my switch to
vegetarianism.
On the grounds of
sustainability
Here, I look at the impact
meat consumption has on the
environment. First of all, massive
deforestation is taking place across
the world to create space for cattle
farms, decimating these incredibly
biodiverse environments as a
result. This is having an important
and lasting effect on the world’s
ecosystems and by removing demand
for these ranches, you could directly
lead to more forests being saved.
Next, in terms of energy
conservation between trophic levels
(remember all that stuff from GCSE
biology?), it is always going to be more
efficient to eat organisms that use
solar energy to grow as opposed to the
chemical energy of other organisms.
If you scale that up, you have a much
more cost-effective way of feeding
the world. I know that there is a lot
of land unsuitable for arable farming
where livestock are the only way to
create sustenance, but we would not
need to exploit this land if we made
better use of areas that could be
farmed.
“But what effect could I have as an
individual?” It is about the principle
of acting ethically and dedicating
yourself to an important cause. If we
took this mentality, we would never
be able to achieve anything!
The morality of animal
husbandry
This is a hotly contested topic, with
both the vegetarians and carnivores
being deeply passionate about it.
For me, it does form the basis of my
choice to become vegetarian but I
do hope I have offered up enough
reasons to make the switch so that,
even if you don’t agree with me here,
you would still consider it.
I personally feel it is immoral to
rear animals for the sole purpose of
killing them, where they have no
control over their own destiny. Just
as you wouldn’t want someone else’s
will imposed on you, I don’t think it is
right for us to do the same to animals.
Does it not seem twisted that the only
reason for their existence is to feed us,
even though we are quite capable of
surviving without them?
“But we are made to eat meat,
what do we have canine teeth for
otherwise?” The evolutionary
argument that, because we are the
dominant species, we have the right
to do this, may be true but is not right
and should not have any bearing on
how we behave. It’s a naturalistic
fallacy. Moreover, evolution is
adaptive, not prescriptive and so you
can’t say we ought to act a certain way
because of evolution. Who knows,
maybe in thousands of years, canine
teeth will be a thing of the past,
replaced by another set of molars to
help grind down our delicious diet of
greens; oh how a man can dream!
