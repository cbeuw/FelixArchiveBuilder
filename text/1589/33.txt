A Wild Symphony of Natural Talent
“There are all sorts of birds here”
Far Away, the 2000 play by British
writer Caryl Churchill, which
makes its return to London in this
production at the Young Vic, begins
with a young girl who sneaks out of
bed and ends a mere 40 minutes later
with a world in turmoil. In between
we have meditations on power,
corruption, and danger, delivered
at a breakneck speed by a confident
cast of four, who traverse the simple
set with a deft skill, making every
moment look effortless.
Churchill is a difficult writer to
take on, with her work ranging
from the surreal – Top Girls begins
with a dream sequence in which the
protagonist meets famous women
from history – to the impenetrable –
her comedy about the stock market,
Serious Money, is written in rhyming
couplets. However, director Katie
Hewitt takes a steady hand to the
script, crafting it into a sharp-elbowed
work that butts its way into your
consciousness. It is little surprise that
Hewitt obtained the funds to stage
the performance by winning the
JMK Award 2014, given to promising
young theatre directors.
The stage is deliberately Spartan,
but belies the complex mechanics
occurring underneath: tables spring
up from underground caverns,
chains carrying fantastical hats
stutter across the ceiling, and by the
end several crater holes have been
blasted in the floor. The cast tread
these boards with finesse, particularly
Samantha Colley, whose performance
as Joan brings a strong physicality to
the performance.
Describing a world of danger and
mystery, the play is in three acts.
In the first, a young Joan confronts
her aunt about what she has seen
her uncle doing down by the shed.
Her feet coated in blood, the girl
enquires repeatedly; what were the
screams she heard? Who were they
loading into the lorry? Whose blood
is it? First annoyed, then cautious,
and ultimately deceiving, the aunt –
played with a maniacal brilliance by
Tamzin Griffin – manages to pull the
wool over her niece’s eyes.
The next two acts continue in
a similar vein, becoming slowly
more surreal; now grown up, Joan
finds work in a milliner, crafting
hats for the ‘Parade’. Striking up a
conversation with her co-worker, we
learn about how the management of
the factory is corrupt, that there are
late night ‘Trials’ on TV, and that the
hats they produce will ultimately be
destroyed. It is only towards the end
of this act that the chillingly horrific
premise is hinted at, something that
wouldn’t seem out of place in Black
Mirror
In the final act, the three characters
are brought together as the world
unravels around them. All of nature,
from the plants to the insects, the
animals to the people, are turning
on each other in a cacophony of
violence, which culminates in a
monologue delivered by Colley in
which she speaks about her paranoia
with a fierce clarity that never feels
histrionic. This energetic conclusion
forms the ending to the play, and
leaves us wanting far more.
Ultimately, this is the main
problem with Far Away; it offers us a
glimpse of a mystical reality, invites
us in, and then slams the door in
our face. It may sound churlish to
complain about the length of the
script – after all, a great play should
make you sad to have reached the
end – but in this instance it feels like
Churchill has not developed her ideas
enough, and for me the play could
easily have been twice the length;
whether Hewitt would have been able
to steer her cast for such a length of
time remains unknown.
With its exciting script and
watertight direction, not to mention
a cast who are able to burn holes in
the stage with their acting talent,

Ablinding light descends on the
crowd, momentarily dazzling
us. In that moment, the
world of this production descends,
transporting us into a dystopia,
disconcertingly similar to our own,
where nothing can be taken for
granted.
Glare tells the story of Alex (Amar
Muchhala) and his relationship with
new girlfriend Lea (Sky Ingram).
After a bitter break up with ex
Christina (Clare Presland), everything
seems to be going extremely well
with Lea: in fact, too well. Uneasy,
Alex talks to friend Michael (Ashley
Riches) about her. Michael, a scientist
in the Futurology Laboratory
reveals that she is literally perfect, a
Learning Exposed Android or LEA
that he designed specifically for
Alex’s pleasure. Initially appalled
by this unbelievable suggestion, the
possibility of its truth starts niggling
on Alex’s mind, causing him to start
distrusting everything Lea does. In
this psychotic downward spiral, his
whole reality is thrown into doubt,
culminating in a horrifying climax.
I was apprehensive in the run up
to this opera; the synopsis sounds
less than convincing – a story of a
man dating a robot. But as soon as
it started, I knew I was completely
wrong. The sci-fi thriller is not that
simple; asking questions of reality,
identity, authenticity and perfection,
it makes us analyse our modern
world and all its hypocrisies. “If
we expect perfection all the time,
don’t we always have to live in
disappointment?” Is it something that
even exists?
The Royal Opera House definitely
saw something in Danish composer
Søren Nils Eichberg. He has created
an innovative sound world that
cleverly augments Hannah Dübgen’s
libretto, interlacing pre-recorded
electronic textures and nightclub
beats with orchestral instruments
utilized in new, inventive ways. This
was the highlight of the work for me –
I had never heard anything quite like
it. As the familiar voices of clarinets
distorted into unfamiliar synthesized
timbres, you were left completely
doubting what you heard in the first
place; it was genius. Coupled with
long shadows and stark neon lights,
you never felt settled in your seat.
Surprisingly rare for opera, the
true intentions of the work were not
Glare - The Future of Opera Looks Bright
Kamil McClelland examines the ROH’s new production
muddled by extraneous characters
or a needless interval: just a simple
four-person cast executing a quick
succession of scenes for a straight
75 minutes. But for such a cut back
production to work, you also need
performers who can carry this
metaphysical weight. Sensitively
portraying her character with
ethereal vocals, Australian soprano
Sky Ingram was impeccable. And
so were the others, convincingly
embodying their characters so that
the implications of the production
were never lost.
In our modern world of Facebook
and Twitter, where we are constantly
constructing an idealized identity of
ourselves, creating a narrative that is
most attractive to others, questions of
perfection and reality are poignantly
relevant. Glare proves that opera has
a place in this world. And despite
somewhat stalling from its frenetic
pace half way through, this exciting
and vivacious work masterfully
blends sound and lighting to ask these
key questions. And is that not what
art is for, altering perspectives and
disquieting us from our comforts? If
so, this opera did an excellent job at it.

Far Away is well worth seeing.
Perhaps a trifle short in length, the
play nevertheless manages to cram
in complex concepts, ensconcing
them in an atmosphere of extreme
paranoia and repression.
Beginning with gentle bird song,
the audience leaves the theatre with
shrill cries still ringing in their ears;
all sorts of birds indeed...
