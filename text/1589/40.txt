Someone You Barely Even Know Adds You On LinkedIn
Aman who you’ve not spoken
to in 2 years wants to add you
to his professional network,
it’s been revealed today. An email
popping up on your phone screen
informs you that Iňigo Lopez-Riera’s
invitation is waiting, and you’ve
spent at least 30 second wracking
your brain trying to work out who
the hell that is.
Your LinkedIn account was
made one panicked evening after
the careers fair a few weeks ago.
You’d realised that you have spent
the last 18 months doing assessed
problem sheets, furtively taking
rubbish MDMA on a night bus
once a term when you feel like you
should behave like an actual student
occasionally, and sleeping for whole
weekends.
Unfortunately you realised you’ve
spent no time actively considering
that you might want a job afterwards.
To compound matters, one of your
friends on your course came back
from her summer internship with
an actual job offer for when she
graduates, while all you’ve got is the
prospect of moving back in with
your dad.
Despite its rather embarrassing
genesis, your LinkedIn profile isn’t
too shabby. You found a photograph
from your nan’s funeral where
you’re wearing a shirt and your hair’s
looking respectable. After cropping
out your grieving family members,
you look veritably professional.
After adding some information
about your degree and the 2 years
you spent working stacking shelves
in a Morrison’s outside Huddersfield
as “previous employment” you then
added all your friends from your
year that you know. You also toyed
about adding your personal tutor
but then chickened out because he’s
a bit weird at times.
These events took place three
weeks ago. One of your friends
endorsed you for “Partying” as a
joke, which you quietly removed a
few days later. You had completely
forgotten about LinkedIn until
other people in your year also
started panicking about their career
prospects and began creating profiles
of their own and importing all their
Facebook friends.
As a result of this, people that
you spoke to for a few hours in the
first week of first year and who
have sat ignored on your Facebook
friend list since then are now
frequently appearing in your search
for a job. Some of them are even
endorsing you for the skills you
put down yourself in a weird act of
HORROR as Male
Scientist Is Treated
Like Female Scientist
Horror has spread through
the scientific community
this week as a man’s
scientific work has been discussed
in the context of how he physically
presented himself to the world.
Talking about the worth of a
person’s work based in part on
their physical appearance is almost
never applied to anybody who isn’t
a woman, and seeing it be done to a
scientist has horrified the academic
world and beyond.
“To see a man who could do science
and talk into a microphone at the
same time be treated as nothing more
than a mere woman is terrible,” an
anonymous Mayor of London told
Hangman. “To think that his merit as
a human being could even remotely
be framed in the same sentence as
a comment on his appearance is
appalling. That sort of thing you
might expect to be done about a pop
singer, athlete, politician, business
woman, comedienne, actress, nurse,
person on the street, police woman,
or female scientist; but not an actual
proper male scientist”
“I’m all for this feminism if it
means there might be someone to
dance with in Metric,” a 3rd year
astrophysicist told a hangman, “But
if equality means that I can’t carry
on being at best blithely pig-headed
and at worst actively misogynistic in
front of my new female colleagues
then what’s the fucking point?”
The story of a man being treated
like a woman was particularly
awkward for Imperial College who
had been hoping to be proud of that
man before everyone started treating
him like a woman. Since everyone
started acting like he was nothing
more than a she, college’s official
twitter and facebook pages have
stopped promoting him so highly out
of shame of his girliness.
“People being mean about
appearance anonymously on the
internet is fine when it’s calling fat
bitches fat bitches on Imperial Tell
Someone Something. We’ll even
let those people graduate without
even attempting to discipline them”
said a College Spokesperson, “But
when people are rude to one of our
scientists because they didn’t like his
shirt it is completely terrible.”
The situation has ultimately
been completely baffling. Several
prominent science men who get paid
for their opinions have even said
they don’t understand why people are
treating this man like a woman.
Some prominent science women
have tried to shed light on why the
man is being treated like a woman,
but since the prominent science
women probably only got their jobs
to make up for diversity quotas back
when they were attractive, their
opinions are probably the bitter
wailings of ugly old hags, and have
thus been ignored.
altruism that makes you feel semi-
uncomfortable.
In six months’ time you’ll receive
an automated email encouraging
you to congratulate Iňigo on his
new job in something to do with
THE HANGMAN GUIDE TO...
Asking questions in lectures
financial services in Hong Kong.
However you’ll be back to living
at your dad’s house and doing shelf
stacking shifts at Morrison’s, so you
won’t be in the mood.
Insufferable employed bastards
