This week you are still the
DPW, and get invited to judge
the Miss Chinatown pageant
due to your esteemed position
as a voice for both home
and international students.
However, , you are unable
to control youself, relieving
yourself loudly at the judge’s
desk before leaving. You are
not invited back.
This week you mistakenly
take a bar shift on the only
night you made plans with
your girlfirend. She gets really
upset, breaks up with you and
tells everyone about the night
she caught you with Monty the
Penguin, an elephant seal, and
a lolrus. Your campus street
cred is irreparably damaged.
This week you discover
Absinthe-Buckfast bombs.
Discovered stumbling along
Sherfield walkway by the Felix
Vice Chair the next morning,
you protest that you were only
drinking to console a friend.
You are shepherded into the
Felix office, and sleep off the
hangover from Hell muttering
about how much you love
Taylor Swift.

Dear diary our library date really escalated! I think the rumours of our scrap with the police on RAG
Jailbreak have slightly exaggerated the truth a bit, but it turns out Dorothy likes a guy who’s escaped from
a Turkmenistan Jail. Anyway after staying in late doing our lab reports, she invited me back to her room
for some “tea”. I knew she meant to do sex stuff as she doesn’t even drink tea past 9pm. Anyway one
thing led to another and a;though we didn’t go all the way we basically like did everything but sex. I basically
did a walk of shame down the corridor afterwards! Get Me!
Sunday 16th
Dorothy came over to my room yesterday evening. It wasn’t pre-arranged or anything although I must admit
I ironed my bed sheets beforehand just in case. This time this is way better than the three awkward
nights with Jennifer at Leeds festival over the summer. Nothing smells of mud and I didn’t get too nervous
and lose my boner after about 5 minutes. Still not sure what I’m with doing “third base” though, I might have
to do some google incognito mode searching later.
Monday 17th
I positively strutted into lectures this morning, diary. What with my new found reputation as an escaped
convict and now having an AWESOME girlfriend (well she is basically my gf, it’s not ofﬁcial). My god Imperial
is the best place ever. I can’t wait to tell Kris when he gets deported back to the UK. His snapchats are
amazing.
Tuesday 18th
A couple of guys on my corridor had a movie night last night. We watched Fight Club, what a classic of
modern cinema I think it’s the best ﬁlm I’ve ever seen. WHO COULD’VE SEEN THAT ENDING COMING!
Dorothy stayed over after, we made out and stuff but I don’t think either of us were in the mood for doing
stuff, I was too busy thinking about Fight Club still. It was so profound about modern consumerist culture too, I
think I’ll read some more stuff by Chuck Palahniuk.
Wednesday 19th
Jesus Christ I started reading more stuff by Chuck Palahniuk and I’ve stopped already, that guy is fucked
up. I’m going back to Badminton club again today, I reckon I should have some hobbies outside hanging out
with Dorothy and reading Spiderman fanﬁction on Tumblr.
Thursday 20th
Badminton was really good, I managed to score some points. Not quite won a game yet but it’s cool to hang out
with people from different courses and years. I’ve sent like 200 Whatsapps to Dorothy, having a gf is hard.
