Cartoon Corner – Teen Titans Go!
Fandoms can be weird places
sometimes. Let me explain...
Teen Titans was a superhero
cartoon (‘capeshit’, as my flatmates call
it) that ran for five seasons from 2003,
based on the long-running DC comic
book of the same name. It was fairly
popular, with above average writing
and characters for its time. I was, of
course, the perfect age for it when it
came out, and for a while it was my
favourite show. It balanced drama and
humour, with interesting characters
and stories, and a lot of it still holds up
today.
Around three years ago, it was
announced that the show was being
‘revived’ as a series of one-minute
shorts called New Teen Titans, with a
more ‘comedic’, light-hearted tone,
with all of the original cast returning.
This was met with much excitement
from the comic book nerds like me,
since we’d grown up with the original
show and had fond memories of it.
Then two things happened at around
the same time: Young Justice, a very
popular cartoon with a similar premise
to Teen Titans, (both were based on
overlapping comics characters) was,
frustratingly, cancelled.
Next, it was announced that the
New Teen Titans shorts were to become
a full series, called Teen Titans Go!,
again with the original voice cast, and
again with less of a narrative focus
than the original (and with cheaper
looking animation). The subtext was
clear: Cartoon Network didn’t like
Young Justice’s adult themes and more
complicated stories (they weren’t that
complex – it was still aimed at twelve
year olds). Instead, they wanted the
simpler, goofier, cheaper show.
The fandom didn’t like the
cancellation, and a consequence was
a big backlash against Teen Titans Go!,
despite us all being previously excited
by the return of the Teen Titans to
our screens. It seemed as though a
lot of the (justified) anger at Cartoon
Network spilled over into hate for the
new show, which hadn’t even come
out yet.
Then when it premiered something
weird happened: it was really funny.
It had a unique energy to it that drove
each episode. The plots were goofy and
outlandish, and the humour, while
childish, often had me laughing along
like I was a twelve year old, and I mean
that in a good way. The original show
had some great comedic moments,
but it ultimately wasn’t a comedy and
had an overarching narrative, and so
couldn’t get away with a punchline
where, for example, the main character
dies of old age. Teen Titans Go!, was
not bound by this limitation, took the
characters all over the place and had
a great time doing it. Scott Menville,
the voice actor of the group’s leader,
Robin, gave such an unexpectedly
funny performance that Robin’s
personality was changed by the writers
to match it, turning him from the
group’s serious, badass commander
into a hyperactive, egotistic, neurotic
control freak, and it was hilarious. We
would never have known he had it in
him.
And yet, the fan backlash persisted.
People refused to watch “the show that
killed Young Justice”. “They changed
it, now it sucks”, they were saying,
essentially. Some fans even brought
out the tired cliché of “they ruined my
childhood”, as if the fact that a new
version existed somehow diminished
the old one. It was a classic example
of the fans’ overinflated sense of
entitlement, in my humble opinion.
Thankfully, finally, the show now
seems to have found the following it
deserves. The Comic-Con panel, for
example, was packed full of excited,
cheering fans. The creators even
generated hype by announcing a
Young Justice crossover! In the end
it was all really a weird story on the
themes of fandom and nostalgia-based
entitlement.

Although he doesn’t go
out to the field anymore,
nothing can keep David
Attenborough away from TV. This
autumn, he returns to the screens
with the series Life Story, an attempt
to show how different animals share
the same rituals and habits across
species.
It may be said that the production
goes a bit God-Almighty on the poor
animals, filmed while trying to get
on with their lives and inserted in a
view that we are all part of the same
great cycle repeating itself (insert
Lion King quote here).
Throughout six episodes,
Attenborough shows us feeding,
courting, and mating as we have
never seen them before . The
message: animals to go through
adolescence, school, pulling,
maternity leave, etc. exactly like us.
And even if this is definitely a case
of man anthropomorphising nature,
it is hard not to be impressed.
The team spent almost two
thousand days filming in a 1,850,798
mile-trek that brought them
across all continents, recording
material for 64,000 DVDs. That’s
dedication. And because the BBC is
eager to show who is top dog in the
documentary world, the intimate
close-ups and majestic slow-mos are
the results of pioneering techniques
and hour and hours of researching
and hiding.
As a big David Attenborough fan,
it’s hard not to watch Life Story with
nostalgia. The show is almost a re-
telling of some of Attenborough’s
career defining moments, bringing
us back to the cheetahs and the birds
David Attenborough has done it again

of paradise. This time, Britain’s
favourite grandpa is only lending
the documentary his voice, probably
anticipating a well-deserved
retirement from TV appearances.
Some may say that this series
in just a repeat of some of
Attenborough’s greatest work shot in
HD. But can there ever be too much
Attenborough? Absolutely not, the
BBC should record him uttering
every word in the dictionary, so
that future generations will be able
to listen to computer-generated
commentaries by our national
treasure.
Here’s the thing: it is not the
stunning shots and innovative
techniques that make Life Story
another great documentary. It’s the
humanity that the commentary can
add to the performances of baby
monkeys and barnacles alike.
Even if we complain that
Attenborough’s work has become a
bit samey, we should enjoy this latest
one, as, without wanting to sound
too grave, it may also be his last.
Watch it on BBC One, Thursdays at
21.00 and remember to order your
free online poster, if you’re a fan of
all things beautiful.
