Microsoft: stepping back into the future
Since the explosion of the
smartphone, Microsoft has been
facing an ever-increasing uphill
struggle. With the introduction of
iOS and Android, Windows is no
longer the only viable OS option out
there. iPads and Android tablets
might not be the productivity
powerhouses that Windows is,
but they have certainly provided
alternatives to people that would
otherwise have no other choice but
to buy a Windows laptop. Bill Gates’
brainchild is still by far the number
one operating system for personal
computers but it hasn’t been showing
the growth it used to – and PC
manufacturers aren’t happy.
The main reason seems to be for all
intents and purposes that Windows
isn’t “cool” . The operating system
has over time become associated with
work, essays and spreadsheets, while
iOS and Android devices have become
associated with social networking
and creativity. But for the most part
people believe the device they carry
is an extension of their personality
and if that’s true, then what does your
Windows Phone say about you?
Microsoft needs to break the
preconceptions people have about
Windows. Their first attempt was
Windows 8 – which focused on play
as much as work. With a new design
language, Metro, and a touch friendly
interface, Bill Gates and co. were
ready to step into a new Windows era.
I’m not going to lie – I loved the
metro style interface. It was bold, it
was new, it looked good, and having
all your information available to you
at a glance was awesome. But that was
not the opinion of most people. They
felt Microsoft had left them behind
to chase after some new market share.
This wasn’t the Windows they were
used to. This was some weird new
Frankenstein OS with different touch
and mouse parts stitched together
and a very confusing split personality.
As a result most of them just opted
not to upgrade. Windows 7 still
holds more than fifty per cent of the
market while 8 is still struggling to
break twenty per cent two years after
its release.
But Windows 8 didn’t just bring
a huge overhaul to the Windows
software, it brought massive changes
to the devices that were running
them. Since its release, hybrid devices
have become the norm. One of those
devices is the Microsoft Surface – a
device which represents everything
the company wanted to achieve
with Windows 8. A laptop and a
tablet, work and play, one device to
rule them all. But even after several
iterations of the device, sales still
haven’t lived up to Microsoft’s
(perhaps optimistic) expectations.
The bad news doesn’t stop there.
Windows Phone has by all accounts
not achieved its goals, holding less
than three per cent of the smartphone
market. Xbox sales haven’t gone as
well as hoped – with the Xbox One
being outsold by the Playstation 4
approximately 3:1. Hammering a nail
into the Windows coffin, Apple has
announced growth in Mac sales in the
last two quarters – a section of the
market otherwise falling year after
year. Whatever Microsoft attempts, it
can’t seem to win.
But the company isn’t giving up.
With their new CEO Satya Nadella
at the helm and a new philosophy
centered on cloud services and
devices, Microsoft is ready to step up
its game.
Last month, the company showed
the public its new operating system,
Windows 10. Skipping 9 is Microsoft’s
quirky way of saying that this version
of Windows is truly the future.
But that might very well not be the
truth as 10 looks a whole lot like the
Windows of the past.
One of the biggest changes to the
new OS is the return of the start
menu: a combination between 8’s
Metro start screen and 7’s most used
apps list. Touch-friendly Metro apps
that could otherwise just be dragged
to take up a certain percentage of
the screen, can now be manipulated
within the familiar windows boxes we
are all familiar with. There is also a
feature called Continuum which gives
Windows 10 devices the capability to
switch between keyboard and touch
mode, depending on the hardware it
detects.
These are all features designed to
make adopting the Windows design
philosophy as painless as possible, and
by all accounts Microsoft seems to be
succeeding. It really does feel like 10
should have come before 8.
But not everything is a step back.
The company is introducing separate
desktops for the first time; a feature
that has been enjoyed by OS X and
Linux users for quite a while now. But
what is truly exciting about Windows
10 is something no other company
has managed to do: a single app store
for all your windows devices. That
includes your phone, PC, tablet and
gaming console. For the first time you
can have true integration across all of
your devices.
By creating Universal apps
Microsoft may be able to convince
Windows PC users that buying a
Windows Phone might not be such a
bad idea, and buying an Xbox while
you’re at it is an even better one.
