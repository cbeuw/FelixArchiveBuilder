Women traditionally play
smaller roles in Westerns.
They are reduced to
rich ladies, pretty widows, or poor
prostitutes. They all get kidnapped
at some point during the film, who
then of course require some sort of
rescuing from male characters. The
Salvation, which played recently at
the BFI London Film Festival, even
takes it as far as making the female
lead, Eva Green, mute. But there is
a big shake-up of tradition in The
Homesman, from director Tommy Lee
Jones. It tells the story of a woman
taking the bold initiative to venture
out into the Wild West, transporting
three women who have gone insane to
a safe place in Iowa.
As a plain jane living in a society
where women are defined by how
they look, cook, clean, and who they
are married to, Mary Bee Cuddy
(Hilary Swank) tries her best to
find herself a man, even though
her interests lie elsewhere. She is a
God-fearing woman of independent
means, a rarity in those days, and
therefore becomes an instantly
memorable character. When tasked
with this mission, she enlists the help
of a low-life drifter George Briggs
(Tommy Lee Jones), although she does
her fair share of the heavy-lifting.
Swank and Jones make a convincing
pair of heroes; Swank, the smart,
determined, compassionate one,
and Jones, the more reluctant, yet
ultimately noble one. Swank is hugely
effective in a quietly restrained, but
meaty role.
Being outside of the societal norm,
she wants to appear strong and
comfortable with her choices, but in
reality the constant reminder of her
“inadequacies” as a woman pushes
her to do things modern women
nowadays would not even dream of
doing. As a rare female-led Western,
it goes where no other Western has
gone before, and Swank is up to the
task of portraying a headstrong
woman who is nonetheless plagued by
insecurities.
Through the female characters of
The Homesman, the audience gets to
see the common hardship and pain
the women would have had to live
through. The three women showing
signs of insanity all have their own
stories to tell, some told better than
others in flashback sequences, but
all of them heartbreaking in equal
measure. Grace Gummer, Miranda
Otto and Sonja Richter are the young
women being transported away
from their home, and their blank
expressions from which all hope has
been drained, highlight the level of
suffering they must have endured for
years.
It suffers from an excessively
episodic format, and struggles
initially to weave everyone’s stories
together, especially when it comes
to editing in the background stories
of the three women. But when the
trip gets going, everyone faces the
harsh realities of surviving in the
wild. There are dodgy men who want
some female company, whether
they consent or not is certainly not
their concern, Indians also roam the
plains, not to mention the fluctuating
temperatures making things extra
challenging. Food and water are also
common issues, as well as having to
keep the three women under control,
where good behaviour is not exactly
commonplace.
There are both beautiful and tragic
events along the way, and it ends
on a rather weak note that taps into
overwrought sentimentality that the
film was so careful to avoid leading
up to the finale. Meryl Streep and
Hailee Steinfeld make what can only
be called cameo appearances, and
it is the plot strand that concerns
the young Steinfeld that becomes
problematic.
However this is a worthy Western
to say the least, a rarity, especially
in this day and age when it is
increasingly rare to have any Western
released.
“Are you paying attention?”
Ellen Mathieson decrypts Cumberbatch’s The Imitation Game
Director: Morten Tyldum
Screenplay: Graham Moore
Cast: Benedict Cumberbatch,
Keira Knightley, Matthew
Goode, Charles Dance, Allen
Leech, Mark Strong
The Imitation Game is the story of
Alan Turing, a story that most
Imperial student probably
knows. He is the father of computing,
the man who helped end the Second
World War an estimated two years
earlier by cracking the enigma
code saving millions of lives in the
process. But he is also the man who
was arrested for homosexuality, was
sentenced with indecency, forced do
undergo chemical castration in an
attempt to ‘cure’ him, and ultimately
committed suicide at the age of forty.
Biopics such as this one are
currently one of the hottest things
in the film industry, with Mr Turner,
The Imitation Game and The Theory
of Everything all being released in
relatively quick succession. They are
a difficult genre to get right, needing
a subject that is well known enough
to get interest from the public, and
a story that is interesting enough to
fill an hour and a half. The Imitation
Game is just the right sort of film, by
parts hopeful and heartbreaking, and
completely engaging.
The role of Turing is taken by
Benedict Cumberbatch, in what is
easily his best role to date. Taking
inspiration from his days as Sherlock,
he brings this fascinating man
to life. From his interview at the
beginning, through his work on
breaking the Enigma Code, through
to the end of his life, he is flawless.
His portrayal is so wonderful, that
the family of Turing have said that
they cannot imagine anyone else
playing the role. It will be surprising
if Cumberbatch does not get his first
Oscar nomination for this role.
The other characters are less
impressive, the acting is solid, but
with so much time understandably
being spent on Turing, you don’t
really get a chance to get to know
anyone else. Charles Dance as
Commander Denniston feels
particularly wasted, only really being
there to get in the way and make
things more difficult for the leads.
As for the “Superheroes in tank
tops and tweeds”, as Matthew Beard
(who played the youngest of the
codebreakers – Peter Hilton) called
the codebreakers, you have Matthew
Goode as Hugh Alexander pulling
off both arrogant and charming with
equal aplomb and Beard as the first of
the characters to make me burst into
tears. It’s just a shame that you didn’t
get to see more of them.
The only major problem with
the casting was Keira Knightly as
Turing’s one time fiancée Joan Clarke.
Knightly has a long history of being
typecast as upper class women with
startlingly posh accents. The problem
is, she’s never been very good at this,
and manages to make the only non-
Turing character that gets any major
screen time into someone who is
bland and, for someone who actually
existed, seem like a plot convenience.
Visually, the film is stunning,
managing to capture the feel of war
era Britain. The first time you meet
Turing he is walking through a train
station full of children being sent off
as refugees. It’s such an iconic image
that it immediately sets the scene.
It is Christopher, the machine they
build at Bletchley Park to crack the
code, that is most impressive. Based
on the original still at Bletchley
(though admittedly made slightly
larger with more of the mechanisms
on the outside to make it look more
cinematically appealing), it gives you
a sense of the scale of what they were
try to build.
Less impressive are the special
effects, with the aeroplanes and
bombs looking terribly fake. But
then again, this isn’t really the sort
of film that you expect them to be
good. Alexandre Desplat’s score is
also excellent, gently reminding you
how you should be feeling. Never does
it get in the way or get too loud and
overbearing, it just sits subtly in the
background prodding your emotions.
Overall, The Imitation Game is a
wonderful, if heartwrenching, film
proved by the fact that it made me
cry not once, but three separate
times. Cumberbatch is impossible
to look away from, and this is one
performance that shouldn’t be
missed.
