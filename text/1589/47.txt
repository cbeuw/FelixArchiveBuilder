Formula One is no longer
interesting. Audiences are
dwindling across the globe and
sponsors are unhappy. Solution? A
double points system for the finale.
Why? Because a margin of two race
victories coming to the ultimate
event is virtually impossible for a
driver to achieve. The hope is that by
artificially extending the title contest
to the final Grand Prix, people will
still watch the proceedings when they
may have otherwise tuned out. More
viewers and no regulation changes for
the teams to worry about; it could be
the perfect solution to all of the sports
problems. Does it sound too good to
be true? It may be great for a casual
viewer of the sport but in reality the
system will just hurt every other
aspect of the competition.
At the whim of meddling
management, Formula One has
undergone many alterations in
recent years to the frustration of
the sports core audience. These
regulation changes were designed to
increase the competitiveness of the
races but have resulted in the cars
being slower and give the air of a
sport that is actively set against any
form of innovation. This has been
compounded by the introduction of
the “overtake button” (KERS) and the
Drag Reduction System (DRS) which
are are prominent examples of how
the action has been tampered with to
artificially generate exciting racing.
These moves are punishing the core
fan base of the sport who are equally
interested in the technical aspects
as the racing. Already discontented
seasoned viewers have also had to
cope with a series of adjustments
to the way in which the points are
awarded at the races designed to
reward more aggressive driving. The
system has changed from 10 points
being given to the winner and only
the top six positions scoring in 2002
to now where the top ten placed cars
are handed points and the winner
receives 25.
Awarding double points in the race
at Abu Dhabi suggests that the race is
in some way more important than the
other 18 but the challenges facing the
teams are exactly the same as at many
of the other venues. The distance
covered over the duration of the race
is the same and the weather wont
play a part as the track is guaranteed
to be bone dry throughout. The
Yas Marina Circuit is one of many
examples of a Hermann Tilke design
on the Formula One calendar which,
with run-off areas that stretch for
miles, offers few challenges to the
drivers during the course of a lap. The
only factor of note is that the race
commences in daylight and finishes
under artificial lighting which, with
other races offering it, is just another
gimmick.
But what about the teams? Giving
a greater share of the points later
on in the season penalises the teams
who start the year with a good
package and those that do not have
the capacity to develop their car
throughout the season. The smaller
teams with tighter budgets invariably
stop development on the current
car when they begin designing its
successor – typically around August
or September – whereas larger teams
such as Mercedes and Red Bull
have the workforce and capital to
do both simultaneously. When the
prize money awarded to each team
is determined by their finishing
position in the championship, it
hardly seems fair to penalise those
with little money even further.
Had the system been introduced
before, it would have had major
impacts on the outcomes of previous
world championships. Hamilton
would never have been crowned
world champion in 2008 with the
title instead going to Felipe Massa
when he won the final race in Brazil.
Fernando Alonso would have
finished ahead Sebastian Vettel in
2012 and Michael Schumacher’s
record breaking seven titles, five of
which were consecutive, would’ve
been reduced by one through losing
the 2003 championship to Kimi
Raikkonen. Having the result of a
championship decided on the whim
of the already controversial F1
Strategy Group would generate a huge
backlash that could do lasting damage
to the reputation of the sport.
Could double points be translated
into other sports? If one day football
fanatics across the country awoke
to the news that the Premier League
will be awarding double points on
the last day of the season the reaction
would unlikely be positive. Why is
one match worth more than another?
What if we are playing away from
home? Have we got an easy draw? It
could hardly be claimed as fair when
the difficulty of the each game varies
so greatly. Many of these points
extend to Formula One where cars are
suited to particular types of circuit
and home advantage may be at play.
The double points system is just
another example of Formula One
moving away from it roots as a
respected and technical sport and
erring towards light entertainment
for a Sunday afternoon. The
stranglehold that parties of
commercial investors have over
the direction of Formula One will
inevitably discourage the sports core
audience from watching the coverage
in the future. If the result of the world
championship this year is affected by
the system in place for Abu Dhabi,
the repercussions will resonate long
into the future and could cripple the
franchise as a whole.
Year Winner Double Points Winner
2012 Sebastian Vettel Fernando Alonso
2008 Lewis Hamilton Felipe Massa
2003 Michael Schumacher Kimi Raikkonen
Championships that would have gone elsewhere if double points had been in use.
Who will be smiling on Sunday?
