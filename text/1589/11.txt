Ilove a good space mission.
Pushing the final frontier,
venturing into the unknown,
lots of robots, rockets and risk – as a
budding engineer, what more could
I want?
Space missions have been used to
inspire future scientists and engineers
for generations: from the Apollo
landings and the ill-fated Challenger
mission, to today’s missions to
neighbouring planets with probes and
robots to see what lies beyond our
own blue dot.
This week’s landing of Rosetta’s
probe is the perfect example. Groups
like the European Space Agency (ESA)
know there is little justification for
their huge budgets if they just keep
the action to themselves. Rockets
are cool and if you can get the public
excited about what you’re doing then
you can fund more science. Not only
that, but you can use these projects
to excite the next generation of
scientists and engineers and get more
kids choosing to study these subjects.
As public bodies this should be,
and is, one of their key goals. Last
week any science teacher worth their
salt would have had the web stream
of the Rosetta mission on in their
classroom. They would have built
discussions and lessons around it:
what’s the point of the mission?
What’s a comet? How did they get
there? Isn’t science awesome?
But then as the nation’s physics
teachers tuned in or watched
YouTube interviews, we had
Shirtgate. Viewers couldn’t help but
notice that one of the scientists’ shirts
was covered in semi-naked women.
How does that make girls in that
science class feel? That they could
have a future doing similar work?
That science is for them? That it’s not
just a bunch of male geeks?
There has rightly been a huge
amount of effort to get more girls
choosing to study STEM subjects,

COMMENT WRITER
According to a recent parliamentary
report, just 17% of STEM professors
are women. If you’re a woman in
science and technology, at some point
you’ll probably be asked to do some
outreach work. I’m a straight, white
man and I have!
As a community we’re missing
out on the contribution that these
women could be making and that’s
a detriment to us all. Projects like
the comet landing are supposed to
be reversing this, but sadly scientists
keep shooting themselves in the foot
with these stupid mistakes.
Let’s all learn from this and move
on.
Those following ‘Shirtgate’ may
have seen this image being
shared on Reddit and Twit-
ter. The Mayor of London certainly
has, as this week he incorporated its
idiotic message into a piece for the
Telegraph, joining the keyboard war-
riors who have defeated feminism,
showing it to be a mess of double
standards and hypocrisy.
To recap: Imperial alumnus Dr
Matt Taylor wore a shirt covered in
scantily-clad women while discussing
the Rosetta mission on television.
After a torrent of abuse on Twitter, he
has made a heartfelt apology. Clearly,
Dr Taylor is no frothing misogynist
– he just made the mistake of wearing
a shirt that was not appropriate for
television, and arguably not appropri-
ate for work.
My beef is not with him, but his
defenders – at least, those who believe
there’s a hypocrisy in deriding his
shirt choice while at the same time
being okay with Kim Kardashian-
West getting naked for Paper. Boris
Johnson goes further, and asks if
feminists are “a bunch of Islamist
maniacs who think any representa-
tion of the human form is an offence
against God” and wonders if we want
to tear down all sexual imagery from
museums.
Being Mayor of London is hard, I
know. Still, a couple of examples from
Boris’s career could help him un-
derstand this situation. Let’s review:
“Kim gets naked and everyone loves
her for it. Why don’t I do it when
opening new free schools?” he asks.
Because there’s a time and a place for
sexual imagery, Boris, and it’s not
when making important announce-
ments about completely unrelated
things.
“We don’t like people brandishing
knives on the streets,” he says, “but
it’s okay when Jamie Oliver does it
on TV every day?” That’s right, Boris.
You don’t like knife crime, but you
don’t want to ban knives from all peo-
ple in all situations, do you? No one’s
suggesting we do the same for nudity.
And here’s the crux of it, Boris: con-
text. Kim Kardashian West chooses to
show sexualised images of herself in a
magazine, where they’re accepted and
the audience know what to expect. It’s
a woman presenting herself – not all
women – as a sexual object, with her
own consent. When someone wears
a shirt with scantily clad women
on television, it’s using women as
background imagery, reducing them
to sexual objects.
I hope Boris has learnt something
here, and I hope you have too, lest a
future Imperial alumnus decides it’s
fine to announce the cure to malaria
wearing a t-shirt emblazoned with
that photo of a vulture watching a
starving African child.

COMMENT WRITER
Shirtgate: Just what is the problem?
“The mayor is unable to
grasp the simple idea of
appropriateness in context”
We’re alienating future female scientists, says George Butcher
"My beef is not
with him, but
his defenders."
"Clearly Dr
Taylor is
no frothing
misogynist"
"...it's using
women as
background
imagery,
reducing
them to
sexual
objects."
