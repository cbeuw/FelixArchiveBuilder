Accolade – A 50’s thriller that is as relevant as ever
Arich, famous and respectable
man has his private life
dragged through the
tabloids. “The Sir and the school
girl!” the media cries. This all
sounds very familiar; the eminent
and the famous are constantly in the
public eye, their lives scrutinised
in every detail by scandal-hungry
press. So a well written, moving,
reflective and excellently performed
play on this recurrent issue of our
times doesn’t come a minute too
soon. But hang on– I forgot to
mention – Accolade was written in
1950.
Emlyn William’s startling modern
and poignant play recounts the life
of Will Trenting, a Nobel laureate
author who lives in Regent’s Park
with his wife and young son.
Scenes of familial happiness,
creative productivity and well
to-do luxury paint a picture of
a happy, successful, respectable
man. And all of a sudden, just as
he is about to receive a knighthood
for services to literature, this
idyll apparently starts to unravel.
Gossip builds up on Trenting’s
licentious parties in Rotherhithe,
where he goes as Bill Trent, his
free and easy alter ego. He gathers
around him drunks, prostitutes
and other disreputable East Enders
for weekends to a bedroom above
a pub with blacked-out windows.
As his family and friends pop
open the champagne and celebrate
the honour, Trenting starts to see
that the knighthood may change
is life, restricting his freedom
and requiring unprecedented
respectability of him. And then
events start spiralling: first tip offs
from his friends from Rotherhithe,
then police advice. To the shock of
his publisher and his middle class
friends, his books on the ‘lower
depths’ are not pure works of fiction
– they are inspired by the author’s
first-hand experience of whores,
orgies and promiscuity.
Despite Will’s increasing
uneasiness about the moral
restrictions he feels closing over
him, it seems that his life will be
unaffected. His wife has always
know and always accepted his
promiscuous inclinations. There’s
even an unlikely merging of his
worlds, as his friends from the East
End frequent his Regent’s Park
house, lightheartedly consoling the
grave and worried members of the
upper class. And then it emerges
that, unwittingly, Trenting has
committed a serious crime, one
which, if publicly known, would
irredeemably mar his reputation.
But, strangely, we can’t help but
sympathise with him. He’s as
honest and unapologetic about his
predilection for debauchery as he
is totally aghast that his actions
could have led to harm. He makes
a clear distinction between socially
imposed morality and fundamental
ethics. Alexander Hanson, who
plays Will Trenting, portrays this
fantastically, turning his character
from a symbol to a man we can all
identify in, a man who can make the
distinction between ‘good’ and ‘well
behaved’, who struggles with the
incongruity with which he lives.
In the light of recent events, such
as the Leveson inquiry, this play
comes across, first and foremost,
about a work on the role of the
media in society. But it is also a
play about people struggling with
Given Dmitry Krymov’s
background, you would
be forgiven for being
disappointed when entering
the Barbican Theatre to see his
production of A Midsummer Night’s
Dream; trained as a set designer,
he created hundreds of pieces
throughout the 1970’s and 80’s,
before starting the Dmitry Krymov
Lab, in 2004. One would then
expect the set for this production to
be phenomenal – an idyllic forest
scene, perhaps, that takes us to
the site of Hermia’s enchantment;
maybe the bank described by
Oberon, where “oxlips and the
nodding violet grows / Quite over-
canopied with luscious woodbine”.
Upon entering however, the stage,
which is little more than a blank
wooden square, covered in a plastic
sheet, strikes one as a little anti-
climactic.
But have no fear – Dmitry
Krymov is notorious for subverting
the traditional ideas of the theatre,
and this production proves no
exception. Before the show starts
a group of craftsmen linger
around the front, before suddenly
springing into action; a large tree
is carried to the back of the stage,
while the audience is made to pass
huge branches down to the front.
Immediately after, a fountain is
taken the same way, spraying water
over the first few rows. We don’t see
either piece again. Welcome to the
Dmitry Krymov Lab.
Over the course of the next ninety
minutes, we are treated to a show
that delights, shocks, and ultimately
removes all pretensions of the
stage, revealing a purity of theatre-
craft unmatched by any other
director working today. Taking
the illustrious Shakespearian work
as a starting point, Krymov has
stripped off any superfluous detail,
until only the bare bones remain.
The quartet of lovers, Hermia,
Lysander et al, have gone, as have
the fairy group; All that remains
are the ‘Mechanicals’, the group of
craftsmen who put on the tale of
Pyramus and Thisbe, the play-
within-a-play which is – to Krymov
– the defining feature of the work:
‘I think it is the Mechanicals and
not the faeries that bear the main
theme of the play’, says Krymov,
‘that art is a dream’.
The void left behind is quickly
fleshed out with additions from
the Lab; acrobats, a consortium of
Russian nouveau-riche, and even a
trained dog are present. But the
stars of the show are Pyramus
and Thisbe, two giant puppets
that traverse the stage unsteadily.
Operated by 10 actors, they lope
around the stage, exchanging gifts,
arranging bouquets, imbued with
the intense emotion of the whole
cast. Krymov allows the processes
behind the work to shine through;
the fourth wall is completely
smashed, and the audience has the
privileged opportunity to be invited
into the magical, dream-like world
of the stage.
While this work is lighter than
some of the company’s previous
work – particularly Opus No 7, in
which the life story of Shostakovich
is played out against a backdrop of
horror – it does not shy away from
addressing some darker ideas. The
faux-audience on the side, who
collaboratively take on the role of
Theseus, Duke of Athens, act as
judge, jury, and executioner. They
are the ones who control the fate of
the play, and it is not a hard stretch
to conflate the power this elite
have over the theatre with their
influence on mainstream politics.
While the work being acted out
on the stage is light, what happens
off-stage is anything but. These
are ideas that cannot be spoken;
they must be shown – and are,
masterfully – through the medium
of visual theatre.
Krymov’s reputation as a
modern genius precedes him, but
he has outdone himself with this
production, which approaches
Shakespeare with the lightness of a
feather and the power of a battering
ram. Krymov is deconstructing
the entire practice, creating a
new visual language with which
to express his thoughts. What he
achieves on this stage within an
hour and a half is nothing short of
breath-taking – weaving together
delicate strands of dreams & reality,
nature & artifice, darkness & light,
the Dmitri Krymov Lab gives us a
masterpiece of modern theatre that
is sure to stand the test of time.

his conflicting desires, about
the double standards which our
society imposes, and about the
responsibilities which we have
towards loved ones. And it’s also a
moving, funny and high suspense
story. What else could you want?
The cast is exceptional, under the
direction of award-winning Blanche
McIntyre who originally directed
this revival at the Finborough
Theatre a few year ago. The stage
set also helps to create a believable
set (Will’s study) which, thanks
to the St James’ theatre very open
structure, really absorbs the viewer
into the action. When the actors
take their bow after two and a half
hours of tears, laughter and tension,
it takes a while to acclimatise from
a 1950 study to a 2014 theatre.
Although, as Accolade shows us,
things haven’t changed much after
all.
