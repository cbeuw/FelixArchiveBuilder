The breakdown of Imperial's estimates of weekly expenditure by students
With college claiming that their
new bursary scheme is“most
generous bursary provision of any
of the leading UK universities”
Felix decided to investigate just
how generous the university
is with its money compared to
others.
It seems that despite concerns
over student consultation on the
matter,the changes will still be
delivering substantially more
money into the pockets of students
than any other London University.
We looked at the bursary
schemes available at London
School of Economics (LSE) and
University College London (UCL),
two other“leading”UK universities
that are also based in London,
alongside the money available to
those studying outside the UK.It
seems that Imperial will offer more
than any other London university
when it comes to money per
student,regardless of household
income.as shown in the bar chart
below.
So just how do universities decide
how much money students need to
live on? Various student surveys are
used to determine the cost of living
in London or as a student in general.
The National Union of Students
(NUS) has predicted that the total
expenditure of a student in London
is around £13,300 for living costs
(£23,500 in total when including
course costs). This includes £6,143
for rent.They predict that on
average a student’s income from
loans and funding comes to £17,450,
so another £6,000 has to be found
from elsewhere.
At UCL they use data available
from the government,and
consider a total of £322 per week
a reasonable amount to cover all
living expenditure.LSE and King’s
College London“broadly estimate”
that students should expect to pay
between £1,000 and £1,200 per
month for living costs.
The UK Government also ran a
Student Income and Expenditure
Survey,and this data is also heavily
used to predict the costs of student
living.
The Student Living Index 2014,ran
by the bank, also found that 22%
of students nationwide are now
receiving less inancial support from
their parents this year compared to

last year.Despite this,the average
contribution per student per week
of funds from parents is still £114.10,
when considering all areas of the
UK in which they study.
The survey also found that,when
ranked,students in London when
compared to other cities are the 6th
most“economical,”meaning they
manage to pay the least amount of
money,but still sustain themselves
with living essentials.London
students do however spend more
money than others on eating out,
spending an average of £17.10 each
week in Nandos and beyond.
When it comes to alcohol, we
aren’t doing much better: we are
6th in the country for how much we
pay per week on beers and bombs.
We pay £10.90 a week on average
at the bar, although if nights at
the Union (or,more accurately, my
bank statements the next day) are
anything to go by,this probably has
a very large standard deviation.
Students in London are also
spending the most on travel,with
each student spending on average
£15.10 a week. The average of
students as across the country is
£6.50.
Imperial have it’s own estimates
of how much student living costs,
as shown in the pie chart opposite.
Despite estimating that students
need £286 to live off on a weekly
basis as opposed to £322, the UCL
average,Imperial still offers more
inancial support than our central
London cousin.
PHILIPPA SKETT
also concerned that the appearance
of reducing funding given to the
poorest students to ease the burden
on middle-earning families would
be a short-sighted and unpopular
decision that doesn’t serve our most
deprived members.”
The report was presented two days
to the board, prior to the Provost’s
board decision that was made on the
31st.
Despite this relatively short turn
around, the bursary scheme has
been heralded as “[representing]
substantially the most generous
bursary provision of any of
the leading UK universities. It
demonstrates the College’s strong
commitment that every home
student should be able to come and
study at Imperial, irrespective of
their circumstances.”
However, Council members are
unconvinced that the changes are
beneficial. Some are concerned
about the apparent lack of
consultation that took place in
making the decisions. Said one
anonymous Council member: “It’s
disappointing that after Acton
and the Chemistry move that
College haven’t realised that poor
consultations really aren’t the way
to go. These changes have been
made in an unacceptable manner
and I hope they realise the negative
impact that this will have on student
satisfaction.”
Said another member: “Calling
the Union President to a meeting
at short notice and then ignoring
his recommendations completely
does not count as adequate student
consultation. The Provost’s Board
could at least pretend to treat
students as equal partners in their
education.”
The last time the bursary scheme
was altered was for 2012 to 2013
applicants, when the tuition fee
increase also took effect. The package
is reviewed on an annual basis and
minor adjustments are made, but
this is the first major alteration since
then.
The Access Agreement and
Financial Support Working Group
then reviewed the package. This
is a panel of college staff from
across all departments, including
the Vice Provost of Education,
Debra Humphris and also included
the Union President. These then
recommended the changes to the
Provost’s Board.
Concluded College: “The College
takes consultation seriously, but
this does not mean that after
consultation it will necessarily
always agree on every aspect of an
issue with the Union.”
