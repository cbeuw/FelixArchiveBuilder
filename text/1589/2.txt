SKETT’S BOX OF SHAME
Apologies for some mistakes in
Issue 1588. These were:
- We accidently split the puzzles
pages. We apologise to our Puzzles
Editor and any confusion caused.
After having all the
horoscopes written about
me by my lovely team,
this week I was planning to write my
editorial being all sassy about them
too. However, looking back through
this issue, the content is pretty
impressive, so I am going to let them
off the hook.
Our science section is taking centre
stage, with James’ interview with
Chris Carr, a scientist behind the
Rosetta team. Everyone has been
talking about the mission that put a
robot on a flying comet (for lots of
different reasons, granted) but the
fact that one of the many people that
made it happen is one of Imperial’s
own is impressive. The fact that we
have his story within our pages this
issue is even cooler.
We have a bumper Arts section
(as usual), and this week it is the
Gaze issue. The Arts team is looking
at, well, how we look at things.
They address, with rather sticking
serendipity, misogyny and how it is
dressed as ‘art.’ I love Arts.
We then address That Shirt in
Comment, and again we return back
to thinly-veiled misogyny. Or is it?
The debate can hardly be summed
up in one page and through two
comment pieces, but our Comment
section gives it a pretty decent try.
The other Big Debate of the week
has been BandAid 30, which Grace
covers in Music and then Tessa, our
Comment editor, discusses and picks
apart. We love a good argument, and
the office has been truly divided this
week over whether or not Bob Geldolf
is well-meaning or simply loves a
good Christmas number one.
News spans from inside the
Imperial bubble to outside of London:
we readdress the bursary changes and
look to see if students are getting a
good deal (turns out they are) and we
also review the new halls in Acton
(turns out they’re not too bad either,
considering they are still miles away).
Consultation is still the debate that
weaves through news though: just
how much of a say should students
have?
Outside of the controversy bubble,
in Film this week we have amazing
reviews of Mockingjay and The
Imitation Game, two big films to hit
the screens recently. Props to our
Film Section Editor Jack Steadman
who went to a midnight screening of
Mockingjay then stayed up all night
writing the review.
We continue on our series on
Mental Health in Welfare, and
in Travel we stay closer to home,
reviewing the Somerset House ice
Rink. We end our issue with yet
another debate, over the introduction
of double points in Formula One
racing.
We would like to thank our
“official” sponsors for the week,
Taylor Swift and Yankee candles.
Unlike our section editors, we love
Blank Space and apparently we
cannot stop sniffing the Christmas
Memories candle we have bouncing
around the office.
We also love our new member of
the Felix team, our Wall Mounted
TV. Shout-out to the Union Overlord
for his endless benevolence and
granting us our wish for a screen
to play Taylor Swift on repeatedly
(I mean, to watch website stats and
discuss layout designs on).
I hope you enjoy this week’s issue as
much as we enjoyed making it. If you
want to come and join us, you know
where we are.

We would like to offer our apologies to the ICT department for
our sensationalist subheading for the news article published on
page 3 of Issue 1588. We appreciate that any inconveniences caused
were purely due to teething issues, and with them all rectified
as soon as possible it was not apt to describe the changeover as a
"disaster".
We will be providing a review of the new system towards the end
of term.
