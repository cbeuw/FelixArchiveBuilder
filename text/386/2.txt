T H E FELIX pilot scheme of producing two issues
per week is hereby initiated, but I have to emphasise
that the idea is purely experimental and in no way
reflects any kind of long term policy for FELIX. Indeed,
if the scheme proves to be impracticable then it may be
scrapped in favour of an eight-page weekly".
The idea behind the scheme is simple: producing a
twelve page issue requires the collation ("putting
together") of three sheets over 2,200 times. Now with
exams in the offing, I feel that it is unreasonable to ask
the non-sabbatical staff to give up four hours of revision
time late on Thursday evening in order to collate FELIX.
However, by producing two four-page issues a week
(with the occasional eight-pager) the time-consuming
task of collating is largely avoided.
That is the theory anyway. Fingers crossed on the
practice!

A minor dissent has arisen over the reporting of the
way in which the IC Union delegation voted on the
Abortion Bill emergency motion at the NUS Llandudno
conference recently". Since I was sitting at the Press
table and not with the delegation for the whole of the
conference I am unable to confirm either way. I was told
of our delegation's voting in good faith by Mrs Gerrard,
nevertheless Mr Payne insists that he voted for the
motion and did not abstain. In light of Mr Payne's sub-
sequent interest in the subject, I am prepared to accept
that he did in fact vote for the motion. I apologise for
any undue embarassment which the conference report
may have caused him.
LETTER
Broad Left Bashing
Phys ics
25th April, 1975
Dear Sir,
Your c y n i c i s m at the
leadership proposed by the
broad left at Llandudno in the
Education motion is w e l l
founded. The disgraceful
tactics of A l Stewart at Surrey
were not the actions of a n
individual but the Policy of
the broad left in practice and
I fear w i l l be nothing compared
to the inactivity and sell-outs
that w i l l come from the broad
left next year.
The complacency (as you
term it) of the N U S executive
is a conscious betrayal of the
fight that students have to
take up to defend their grants,
housing a n d education f a c i l i -
ties i n a period of slump. The
huge turn-outs at the N U S
demos this year were a slap
in the face for the broad left
who moan about C J O . apathy.
There i s no apathy today—only
a vacuum of leadership. T h i s
cannot be f i l l e d by c a l l s for
more militancy, only by a
fight for s o c i a l i s t p o l i c i e s
which i s conspicuous by i t s
absence from the broad left
motions.
It i s no surprise that the
WRP were the first to warn of
the dangers of slump to the
conference i n opposition to the
" b o o m - i n - 7 7 " posturings of
the I S ' s leading economist
John Palmer of the Guardian
and to warn that the Labour
Party M P would betray en
masse against the " L a b o u r
Lefts w i l l f i g h t " mouthings of
the C P and the Broad l e f t -
where was the rush to support
E r i c Heffer?
A s for Trev P h i l l i p s '
appeals to V i c e - C h a n c e l l o r s
to stop v i c t i m i s i n g students—
they place him on the same
cloud nine as you were before
you discovered the bias of the
capitalist press, except that
in P h i l l i p s ' case he knows a l l
too w e l l the waste of time of
such diversionary appeals—he
and the rest of the broad left
w i l l P r e n t i c e ' s most trusted
lieutenants i n the year to
c o m e .
