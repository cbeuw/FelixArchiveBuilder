James Wilkinson
The Radiophonic Workshop
(BBC Records)
THIS R E C O R D of electronic music
from the B B C Radiophonic Workshop is
designed to entertain. In doing so it a l s o
demonstrates the whole range of electro-
nic music from the production of the
sounds s i m i l a r to conventional instru-
ments, through wierd drifting mood music
(reminiscent of Tangerine Dream's work),
to sound effects and other unholy n o i s e s .
E a c h track is credited to an individual
composer. My favourite is " R o m a n e s c a n
R o u t " in w h i c h the stereo facility,
sound effects, and music s i m i l a r to that
produced by conventional instruments
are a l l merged to good effect.
A n interesting album.

Roy Buchanan: Rescue Me (Polydor)
IN SOME c i r c l e s Roy Buchanan Is
regarded as the new guitar-hero, though
not necessarily agreeing with his
assertion himself — and rightly s o . On
this album he displays an extensive,
impressive control of his instrument with
his blues upbringing always to the fore,
and an imagination not far behind the
technique. He produces streams of fluid
guitar phrases as e a s i l y as a jagged
staccato run from within a welter of
soulful brass and percussion (as on the
track). A l l this however is marred by the
use of tunes lagging 10 or 20 years
behind the times, featuring such e x c e s s -
ively drawn-out blues jams as " C . C .
Ryder" and various numbers that should
have been locked In the closet ages ago.
Obsolete sounds do not s e l l records and
Roy Buchanan's reputation should take a
pounding for allowing such mediocrity to
be released . T h i s , his 4th album, might
just as w e l l be his 100th for a l l it's
innovations. It stands simply as a replica
of the other three. It's a pity that his
roots are embedded in the overgrown s o i l
of the past, because his a b i l i t y could
have made him an important m u s i c i a n .
He has chosen his " m e t i e r " however
and these days pure blues have very
little to s a y .

David McLellan: Marx (Fontana)
N E I T H E R die-hard anti-communists
nor committed marxists w i l l find this
book pleasant reading. M c L e l l a n tries to
demystify the prophet Marx, and to some
extent he s u c c e e d s . Contrary to popular
belief Marx was more ofa socio-economic
analyst rather than a latter-day Jeremiah.
H i s prolific writings, immense in scope,
portray a highly intellectual mind
attempting to grasp the e s s e n t i a l s of
human society and life. Marx's attempts
to provide a cohesive and total image of
humanity seems to have failed, because
he was patently unable to draw a l l the
different strands of his own philoso-
p h i c a l , s o c i a l and economic thought
together. T h i s task was left to his
d i s c i p l e s who seemed only interested in
grafting their own ideas onto the body of
Marxist p h i l o s o p y . However, on»-
interesting side effect has been the
controversy about how much Marx was
influenced by Hegelian philosophy.
M c L e l l a n seems to side with the George
Lukain school of thought in maintaining
that both Marx's earlier and latter
writings were influenced by Hegel's
concept of man's " a l i e n a t i o n " . T o
some extent M c L e l l a n may be right, but
one cannot help but suspect that as a
Marxian scholar who is deeply involved
in his subject, he is trying to project his
own liberal humanist beliefs onto the
marxist philosophy that he writes about.
