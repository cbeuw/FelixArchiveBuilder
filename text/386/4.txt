T H E 192ND Meeting of the Imperial College Union opened
around 6pm with the President, Mr P h i l l i p s , in the chair.
Matters arising from the last meeting:
Regarding the notice about a Debating contest organised by
the New University of Ulster which had been passed on to the
Editor of F E L I X to publish, it w a s reported that the notice had
not been printed because the particular F E L I X which it would
have gone into would have appeared after the c l o s i n g date for
applications to be received . T h u s the notice w a s not printed.
Someone remarked " a very shrewd move" .
French Trip: Mr Branthwaite reported a reciprocal v i s i t had
been made by the French. H e had received no help from C o u n c i l
members. The French students d i d make a nuisance of them-
selves.

even make reference to 'homosexuality'.

Block with a view to organising some sort of function on June
20th.
Finance: T h e Union is to a s k for a subvention of £82.330
(compared with £57,820). T h e claim amounts (with other income)

increased c o s t s .
Student Residence: The President reported that inflation is
now so high that some college authorities intend to review hall
rents termly instead of annually . H e suggested if this were to be
the c a s e , then grants too should come under review termly.

A J 0 . B .
The Student Residence Officer, Mr Salisbury, presented a
motion concerning the selection procedure for residents in Hamlet
Gardens. It c a l l e d for a preservation of the present system of
selection — apparently at the warden's personal discretion — for
this year and then put down new rules and regulation next year,
the motion w a s rejected.
The Editor of F E L I X , Mr Williams, proposed that, in light of
the time-wasting often associated with procedural motions being
moved by reference to the numbering listed in standing orders,
Council should in future refer to a procedural motion (or any
standing order) by its content and not by its number. C o u n c i l
agreed.
The meeting was adjourned at 12.20am (the guillotine having
been suspended at 11 pm).
