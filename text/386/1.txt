20 MORE RESIDENCE PLACES FOR WOMEN —
SEX DISCRIMINATION?
VAT E R R O R
IN 1973, Joseph Murray, Warden of the A l l e n H a l l of Residence
(University of Manchester) refused to charge V A T on guest room
fees during termtime. T h e Government's V A T Commissioners
disagreed with h i s attitude and took him to court. The resulting
V A T Tribunal upheld the Warden's d e c i s i o n and ruled that no V A T
is payable on guest room fees on a student area during termtime.
T h i s came to light when the
Deputy President, R o n K i l l ,
was reading through the quart-
erly newsletter of the
A s s o c i a t i o n of C o l l e g e Wardens
College B l o c k
R e - n a m e d
C o l l e g e B l o c k , the admin-
istrative core of the college
which was opened in December
1969 by the Queen, i s to be
re-named at l a s t .
It i s to be c a l l e d "The
Sheffield Building" in recogni-
tion o f L o r d Sherfield's services
to the College a s Chairman of
the Governing Body from 1962 —
1974. O n e suspects that the
College w a s waiting for a
prominent College dignitary to
either die or leave before any
re-naming would take place,
but that i s just sheer s p e c u l -
ation .
A d d i t i o n a l l y , the new hostel
block which was completed at
the College F i e l d Station,
Silwood Park, in February 1974
is to be named "William Penney
Hall" i n recognition o f L o r d
Penney's long a s s o c i a t i o n with
the College as a student, staff
member and Rector from 1967 —
1973.

H a l l Warden, Dr Geoff E v a n s .
The legal reference for the
case i s 1 V A T T R 33 1973 and
it i s clear that the case was
contested i n 1973. The guests
of students at IC, however,
have been paying VAT on guest
rooms throughout the session.
It i s obvious that the College
B l o c k f i n a n c i a l machinery has
slipped up somewhere along
the l i n e . The C o l l e g e ' s popular
' V A T m a n ' , Terry D o o r i s , left
College at the end of last term
so there is a state of confusion
as to how this a l l happened.
Undertakings have been
given that this unfortunate
situation w i l l be sorted out.
But i n the meantime, a l l
those who have been charged
V A T on guest room fees are
entitled to a refund.
THE C O L L E G E has decided to raise the proportion of
women in residence (halls and houses)from 10.7% to 12.3%.
This has resulted from theal location of twenty of the thirty-
nine new places, which will be available from next October,
to women.
It is College p o l i c y to align
percentage of women i n r e s i d -
ence with the percentage of
women at the C o l l e g e . I f t h i s i s
to be the case, then on present
figures there w i l l have to be
nearly 100 more women at I C
next year, making a total of
over 500. It appears that i n
recent years, a greater propor-
tion o f students have been
women than the estimated
figures on which the a l l o c a t i o n
of places w a s based. ( L a s t
year i s being quoted a s an
exception since 10.7% of a i r
residents i n h a l l s and houses
were female whereas they only
formed 10.1% of the C o l l e g e ) .
However it would seem that
even allowing for this, an
increase of20-25%in the female
contingent of the College is a
major overestimation.
L a d y Anne T h o m e , the
Senior Tutor for women, w a s
approached by F E L I X . On our
suggestion that it would appear
that women were c l e a r l y going
to be given greater preference
than men, s h e replied with
three points: firstly, the number
of women at College does have
a general upwards trend;
secondly, a high percentage of

R i z Shakir, currently the
Features Editor of F E L I X , was
declared elected to the post of
Deputy President of I C U n i o n
for the next academic s e s s i o n .
Despite the fact that there
were two fully proposed can-
didates when the nomination
papers came down o n Monday,
Mr Shakir w a s nevertheless
declared elected when h i s
opponent, Graham P a t e r s o n ,
withdrew from the e l e c t i o n .
The result h a s generally
released sighs of relief from
certain sectors of the U n i o n
who were convinced that i f the
election went to a ballot, i t
would certainly have been
inquorate and thus necessitated
yet another election . T h e
election i s , of course, subject
to ratification at the next U G M .
women are freshers, who there-
fore tend to soak up a lot of
places at the expense of second
and third years; and thirdly;
far more female than male P G ' s
w i s h to have to rooms in resid-
ence s o once again they would
tend to soak up the women's
allocation at theexpense of the
second and third y e a r s . Thus
the admitted " o v e r e s t i m a t i o n "
is to help out the second and
third years.
The opponents of this
scheme say that it is ill-planned
and that i t does not take into
account many aspects of the
residence s i t u a t i o n . T h e
point w a s made that women
much prefer single rooms than
double rooms (are fewer single
rooms going to be a v a i l a b l e to
men?) and that on the whole
there i s a far wider range of
alternative accommodation
f a c i l i t i e s available for women
than for men.
There seems to be a general
feeling of disapproval amongst
the men at I C and the Union
did, i n fact, oppose the move
but to no a v a i l .
When asked to comment,
B i l l Gerrard, the Warden of
Mining House s a i d " / feel a
little disappointed that Lady
Anne Thome did not take the
trouble to personally consult
enough people on this matter.
There are still some uncertain-
ties as to how the scheme may
be implemented in practical
terms."
The final Union view on the
matter was the expectation that
the places w i l l not a l l be f i l l e d
next year. A request i s to be
made for letting men into the
vacant rooms i f this turns out
to be the case.
