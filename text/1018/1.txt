Christmas Fracas On Queen's Lawn
. *****
Peaceful: A quiet summer's day on the Queen's Lawn
B Y A N D Y S I N H A R A Y
Two members of college staff
have been arrested following
allegations of a serious assault
which took place at the end of
last term. It seems an argument
between staff, a student and an
ex-student of Imperial i n the
Holland Club led to an assault on
the Queen's Lawn.
The incident occurred on
Friday 16th December, the last
day of term. It was brought to the
attention of college authorities
after the girlfriend of one of
those involved reported the
attack to college security. Two
security officers were dispatched
and on arriving at the scene
found the injured. They were
found to have various cuts and
lacerations.
On being accompanied back
to the Holland Club, they were
able to identify their alleged
assailants who are due to appear
in court on February 6th.
Following these events, certain
college sources have claimed that
three technicians have been
dismissed and further suggested
that one of the technicians has
started proceedings against the
College for unfair dismissal.
The events on the Queen's
Lawn seem a continuation of the
spate of drink related incidents
which have hit College recently.
Others include the arson attacks
in Linstead Hall and violence in
Beit Quad. Two weeks ago in a
letter to FELIX, Lucy Chothia,
I C U President, called for clubs
and societies to take more care
over drink related activities.
College authorities have also
stressed the need for care.
Speaking to F E L I X , Terry
Briley, Deputy Head of Security,
advised licensees to 'tighten up
rules' to avoid incidents
attracting 'the unnecessary
attention of police'.
Campaign Manager for New Election
BY A N D R E W S M I T H
Imperial College U n i o n
Elections Committee have taken
the controversial decision of
appointing a manager for this
year's New Election campaign.
£40 w i l l be available i n the
upcoming elections to the
manager chosen to oppose those
running for the four sabbatical
posts.
The elections committee,
announced last week as: the
Departmental Representative of
Chemical Engineering, the
Publications Board Chairman,
the R C S President, the R S M
Academic Affairs Officer, the
SCC Chair and chaired by the
ICU President, took the unusual
decision at its meeting this
Wednesday. T h i s is i n stark
contrast to last year's decision by
Andrew Wensley, then I C U
President, who even discouraged
a publicity campaign, the usual
practice in previous years.
Earlier Lucy Chothia, I C U
President, had told Felix of her
preference for merely a publicity
campaign, even going so far as to
outline the dangers of appointing
a full campaign manager.
W h i l e recognising that
students always should have a
choice, Ms Chothia emphasised
that a New Election campaign
could get out of control, with
people voting for it simply to
express disgust of the U n i o n ,
rather than of the particular
candidates.
