Burkina Faso is a landlocked country of West
Africa, swept by the hot harmattan winds and
a spirit of uncertainty. The national language
is French, a legacy of Burkina Faso's past as a
French territory until independence in 1960.
Six coups and two changes of constitution
since then have not helped economic stability,
and this, plus unrelenting drought, has made
Burkina one of the poorest countries in West
Africa.
The capital, Ouagadougou, is an
important centre for aid distribution in West
Africa, but ninety percent of the population
live in villages scattered around the river
Volta and up to the Saharan borders. Iain
Tromans (pictured on rock), Steven Patterson
(pictured in hat) and Peter L o , all members of
Imperial's Christian Union, spent a month
travelling around Burkina Faso at the end of
the rainy season in September 1994.
"I worked all summer in a pizza place
for £1.80 an hour," said Steven, explaining
how the project had been financed. "Then I
blew it all on going to Africa. The boss hired
me because I came from Imp-
erial. He said he liked to take on
Imperial people and torture
them because he wasn't acc-
epted here to do a PhD".
The original initiative
came from Iain, who spent three
months in West Africa before
coming to London. His project
was run by a missionary society
which at the time was dev-
eloping a five year plan for
tackling some of the economic
problems of the region. In the
spirit of ventures like Cafe
Direct (fair-trade coffee, now
available in Sainsbury's), the
society exports local crafts to
Britain, returning all the profits
to Burkina Faso.
"It was very green when
we were there, but that was
unusual," recalled Steven.
"September is the very end of
the rainy season, but we had
quite a few wet days and people
were very pleased". "Except if
they had to travel long dis-
tances, like us," continued Iain.
"Flash floods took the roads
away, and we had to make an

80km diversion".
Speaking French was no
trouble for Iain and Peter, but
more of a challenge for Steven:
"It was a bit frustrating, but it
got better because I decided to go for it and
just make mistakes". The three's main role in
Burkina was to travel to different villages, set
up sound equipment and play the Christian
message in local languages to the people. Less
confrontational than other approaches, the
method seemed to go down well:
"When we went to villages with the
tapes, people would sit and listen for half a
hour and give us Tuareg tea and milk and
things", said Steven. "In fact they said 'This is
good because we don't have very many ways of
finding out about G o d ' " . "People aren't
encumbered by all the wealth that we have in
Britain," added Peter. "They're very friendly
- 1 liked them a lot".
Nearly half of the Burkinabe (the people
of Burkina) are M u s l i m . Another large
proportion practise animism, or ancestor

worship. This means that they often accept
the M u s l i m god superficially: "When the
animists leave their village, they feel they
need a bigger god who covers more. Once they
meet someone telling them about a god over
everything, they're very open to it", said Iain.
"It's the same at Imperial," went on Steven.
"One of the Muslims gave me a sticker which
said 'Play It Safe: Become A Muslim'".
T r y i n g to convert already religious
people from one set of beliefs to another may
seem pointless or egotistical. The three lads
believe that they had better motives. "Islam
doesn't answer the basic need to humanity"
said Steven, quietly. "We need a relationship
with G o d , not just a set of rules and
regulations". Said Iain: "The Muslims in
Burkina put a very strong emphasis on the
outward show of being a good Muslim. The
Africans even tried to make
themselves look as Arabic as
possible by wearing long white
robes."
Are the supposed
converts any more than 'rice
Christians' though - who
accept the beliefs on offer with
an eye on the material rewards?
Steven countered this: "We
found that the people there
were so generous to us that we
were more like the rice
Christians. They really gave us
the best of what they had".
Iain felt that the efforts
of the missionary society
haven't been imposed on
B u r k i n a , but are part of an
ongoing project which has
grown up within the country
itself. While there are very few
Christians, those that are there
are very active. "We went to
Burkina with a professional
from the society, but in
Ouagadougou we worked
alongside a Burkinabe evan-
gelism team," said Steven.
