After the committee's
decision was taken, M s Chothia
struck a conciliatory tone
encouraging anyone interested in
becoming the manager to come
and see her regarding the
position. Imperial College Union
C o u n c i l w i l l decide who the
successful candidate will be at its
next meeting on 13th February.
It is hoped by the committee
that the campaign would be run
for fun, and that it would also
keep the candidates 'on their
toes'. At the same time Lucy
Chothia stressed that no one
would be forced to attend the St
Lunchers

No one w i t h i n the U n i o n
building responded when rape
alarms were set off last week.
College security were on the
scene ' w i t h i n a minute' but
those enjoying their lunchtime
pint i n the traditional bar
stayed put.
The alarms were set off in
the 1st floor women's toilets at
lunchtime on Wednesday 18th
January by Lucy Chothia, I C U
President, and A n n i e
Matthewman, I C U Welfare
Officer. The test attempted to
gauge what response was
provoked but although the
noise was said to be
'uncomforatbly loud' i n the
traditional bar, no one went up
to investigate. "The punters
were sitting around looking a
bit puzzled," said M s
Matthewman. Apparently, the
noise sounds just like a car
alarm and those present were
not aware of what it was.
The experiment has raised
questions about the safety of
women in the Union buildling.
"College security should be
commended for their prompt
response," praised A n n i e
Matthewman, but she felt that
those i n the U n i o n office
should also have been alerted.
At present the alarms sound in
the traditional bar, i n the
security lodge in Beit, and in
Sherfield security.

past for it's 'lively atmosphere'.
Ironically New Election's
candidature seems to be the most
advanced, as there is no clear
picture of who is in the running
for the four sabbatical posts.
Suggestions that disaster
looms, with the possibility that
no one might stand for any of the
posts has been denied by various
Union sources. Ms Chothia did
though urge anyone who might
be interested i n assuming her
role to come and talk to her to
find out what the President's job
entails. She also encouraged
those who might not have
suggested at Monday's welfare
committee include the inst-
allation of rape alarms in all the
toilets, especially those i n
isolated areas of the building and
previously considered themselves
as candidates to stand, saying
that anyone, even those without
Union experience, who decided
to really dedicate themselves to
the job for the year could be a
successful Union sabbatical.
It is also being stressed how
important next year's sabbaticals
will be, with such important long
term decisions being considered
as the medical merger and the
possible move of the Union itself.
"It is vital that we get a really
good person," Lucy concluded,
emphasising the need for a
choice of candidates i n the
forthcoming elections.

RCS to
vote on
NUS
B Y M I C H A E L I N G R A M
A new twist has been added to
the debate on Imperial College
Union's (ICU) membership of
the National Union of Students
(NUS) this week. Members of
the Royal College of Science
Union (RCSU) look set to have
their own vote on the question of
affiliating to the national student
organisation.
F E L I X has learnt that a
motion is due to be submitted to
the next R C S U Union General
M e e t i n g ( U G M ) on 19th
February, which w i l l call for
R C S U members to vote on
affiliation to the NUS. If passed,
the RCSU Executive Committee
would be forced either to arrange
a referendum of union members
or put the issue to a U G M .
Imperial College U n i o n
(ICU) and its Constituent
College U n i o n s (CCUs) are
currently among the small group
of student unions who are not
affiliated to the NUS. This is in
keeping wit h I C U ' s trend of
remaining apolitical and hostile
to affiliation with any politically
active organisations.
Under the new I C U
constitution, it would be possible
for any of the CCUs to affiliate to
the NUS with a mandate from its
members. However, the financial
implications of such a move
could come under severe
opposition from both I C U and
the C C U . T h e N U S charges
affiliates an annual fee i n
proportion to their membership.
If I C U were to join, it could be
charged as much as Â£40,000.
The South K e n s i n g t o n
based C C U s must have their
budgets approved by the I C U
Union Finance Committee. I C U
insiders have hinted that a C C U
wishing to affiliate would have
trouble increasing their budget
to cover the affiliation fee. The
fee would therefore have to be
paid for out of the existing
