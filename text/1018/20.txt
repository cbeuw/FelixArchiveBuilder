Standby
Standing in a room facing Jeff
Buckley. The extremities of my
body shake with music and
emotion. He stares me in the eye
as I mouth the lyrics of 'So Real'.
"I love you," he sings with a
raised eyebrow , "but I'm afraid
to love you" I return. What
ordinarily would be embarrassing
is now a sublime communion. I
give myself to the moment, I fall
into the role of fan, I gasp before
my idol. Jeff Buckley, twenty blue
light beams shooting from his
body to the ceiling above, drips
with sweat; his face contorts, he
hatchets out the words from the
microphone and for me he
summons the devil.
He had begun our reverie
only at the end of a chain of
confusions. Firstly, a half an hour
wait twixt Bettie Serveert and the
roadies leaving the stage. The
audience was noisy and pushed
me ever closer to the front. Before
me three fifteen year old girls
clutched their hands to their
chests. Behind me two fifty year
old men noisily prepared to
bootleg the gig. Frustration
welled up: had I forgotten my
cares, stresses and readied myself
for this? To have my face beached
in cigarette smoke and my legs
contorted like a ballerina to avoid
the wrong signals being sent by
the right parts of my body that
touched those of another? I'm a
bad indie-kid; I get self-conscious
and I never dance.
After two false alarms three
pale, attractive men filed onto the
stage. Everyone clapped and at
the back they obviously thought
Buckley had arrived. (Later a
universal truth). I was very close
but still confused - mistakenly
thinking Jeff the sole guitarist in
the line up (with a bass and
drummer) I tried to snatch a look
at the faces for a moment longer.
They all had the same hair as Jeff,
all the same height but none
seemed right. (And yes, I have
seen his face before but my
admiration is not one of brain-
burning lust - not really and
certainly not then - and at that
moment I lacked the confidence
to be certain of his features). But
at last, after twenty seconds of
this confusion, enters the king.
He wore a checked and long
sleaved shirt over a white v-cut T-
shirt, rooted in blue jeans. His
hair was cut to the short male-
model mode worn by the rest of
the band. He seemed more like
an embarrassed goofy friend as
he moved toward the microphone
- quick steps as he pulled his
guitar over his head, a giggle and
an indecipherable mutter as he
^ And there were giants on
the earth in those days,
and after that
snagged on something, then a big
smile to the audience.
Immediately noticeable was the
spot that picked him out from the
others. They stood around in
motionless darkness, illuminating
Buckley as an almost messianic
figure flanked by his disciples.
Although later he introduced
them by name, and fine players
they were all, they were largely
unimportant except as props. Jeff
held the stage.
He opened and too soon the
first song was underway. And
began a night long battle of
equals, with the microphone and
himself, taunting and testing his
own prowess and quickly gaining
full mastery of his five octaves,
raising his voice at will from the
soft pander of lullaby to full-
throated battle cry. His guitar
added music in sympathy and
seemed almost as free as his
lyrics - although no guitar hero in
the sense of wild solos or rampant
feedback, his mastery of tempo,
timing and improvisation is
something I've never seen before.
He brings to the live performance
the fluency of a jamming session
where traditionally the best ideas
are lost. The songs are familiar,
most taken from the debut album,
and yet it is that same music
possessed and wilful, strutting
and soaring on its own vivacity.
He quickly arrives at 'Last
Goodbye' and this personal
favourite becomes a searing
lament, with Buckley apparently
calling up the memory of every
love he's ever waved away in an
unbearably romantic and visible
rendition. So my soul is already
with him as we reach 'Eternal
Life'. This Robert Plantian howl,
with Buckley alternately swooping
from philosopher to contempt-
uous yet humanistic atheist is
tonight made to seem like the
best heavy metal song yet written.
It begins this time with him crying
a long monotonic cut-and-paste
of the lyrics, unaccompanied by
any other noise. Then the guitars
slam in, the jaunty rhythm of the
album version replaced by a new
juddering, evil war-anthem. But
as Buckley negotiates "racist
everyman, what have you done?"
the guitar fails him - he throws it
on the floor in a fury. It's a
revealing edit:
" D a m n , damn, damn, a
Japanese modell And it was
going so well tool". The audience
are sympathetic yet Buckley
mimics his recent press, saying: "I
just want it to be good for you to"
and "Me, the spoiled brat, me me
me!" But of course he is spoiled,
in that his talents are so
prodigious that after what he
himself describes as a premature-
ejaculation he can start the
deranged rendition again and
once more carry us away.
After this mind-blowing
performance he can take us
anywhere and does. On 'Mojo
Pin' he inserts random stream-of-
thought interludes. "It's not a
needle, it's not a bottle, it's not
you and not her" he harries down
the mic. He covers some favourite
which I should know but don't,
only know that Buckley's
performance of it, a bluesy
orchestration which has him
control the drummer with his left
hand, occasionally playing a
chord with his right and sounding
like the lost daughter of Billie
Holiday, has instantly propelled it
to genius. Finally he says
"goodnight" only to change his
mind and play his encore. "So I'm
your jukebox?" he asks the crowd,
not just in jest, but he gives them
'Hallelujah' anyway and you
could hear a pin drop. I have
stupid urges; to hold a lighter in
the air or to fall out and back into
love just to better relate to the
man on the stage. The words ring
true.
He leaves and most can't
believe he will return - some that
he can't even attempt to follow
that classic. But for once I clap my
little morse code with the rest: " C -
O-M-E B-A-C-K-J-E-F-F" After
some long and suspended
minutes, to a mind that seems
almost post-coital, he does. I
wonder behind my lop-sided grin
what he will do - another cover or
a cigarette, a new number or a
shower? But he takes that guitar
and leads a chiming guitar swirl,
the first three minutes of which is
a subtly changing loop of melody,
repeated over and over until you
want to stamp your feet and shout
"yes, yes, YES!" Then the words
say their thing, then the guitar
chorus is back and I don't know
what he's saying, just revel in my
place in the storm.
After a period of time it is
over and I leave, walking dazed
down the street like a drug-fucked
runaway.
