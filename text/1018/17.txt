two tales of lovers

I know that I've been living here
too long when I start to get
nostalgic cycling along Rotten
Row. On one side is the
Horseguards' Barracks, on the
other is the sandy mud of Hyde
Park. Neither are worth a second
look really but after five years you
get to known them so well that it
becomes an effort not to like
them. But I'm not so ruined as to
accept the inevitable yet. For the
present I still have a favourite bit
of London which has an aesthetic
rather than sentimental rationale.
Walking from Harrods
towards the Victoria and Albert
museum is the stretch of the
capital that I enjoy the most.
There's no exact point of discrete
pleasure. I can't hurry to one spot
and then stand there, looking
around in rapture. I have to walk
from Harrods, past the gangs of
clientele and the tedious rows of
parasitic shops that hang of its
shirt-tails. By the time that I'm past
them and have started to take the
gentle curve of Cromwell Road
things look good. The overbearing
presence of Brompton Oratory
sails past on the other side of the
road and then the V&A appears.
An expanse of white stone
nestling behind slender trees set in
a pavement continental in its
width. On a really choice moment
the road clears of cars and sun's
setting rays caress the towers.
Anything could happen in that sort
of capital. 0
only you
In only you, when Faith (Marisa
Tome/) asks a Ouija board who her
soulmate will be the name Damon
Bradley is spelt out. A while later,
this time at a carnival, an old gypsy
tells her the same name. Being 11
years old and receiving such a
distinct name from the othersi^a,
Faith becomes obsessed with
meeting this person.
Years later Faith is in her mid
twenties and is just about to get
married to a podiatrist (foot doctor).
Suddenly out of nowhere Damon
Bradley telephones saying he is
unable to attend the wedding since
he flying off to Venice. Faith,
determined to get one glimpse of
the man with the right name,
impulsively flies to Italy. There she
ends up meeting Peter Wright
(Robert Downey Jr) and he falls
madly in love with her. Still
desperate, Faith travels around
Italy following Bradley's tracks, with
Peter in tow like a love sick dog.
Undaunted by Faith's own agenda,
Peter follows Faith using all his
energy to express his love for her.
Throughout the film there are
scenes that make you cringe, and
want to hide behind a big sign of
sensibility. They are excruciatingly
silly but definitely romantic. With
re-enactments of 'Casablanca' and
'Roman Holiday' the film has an
old fashion love theme. It has
touches of a fairy tale with Peter
and Faith meeting up when she
happens to loose a shoe. So from a
podiatrist to a shoe saleman, Faith
lives the Cinderella story, while
travelling around Italy, in search for
her destined love.
Marisa Tomei and Robert
Downey Jr have both received
academy awards for their acting
skills. Tomei received hers for 'My
Cousin Vinny' and while Downey Jr
received a British academy award
for the film 'Chaplin'. At first they
seem an odd pair to mix but as the
film progresses you start to
appreciate their characters as star
crossed lovers. 'Only you' may not
be a film that has a loved one
bursting into sentimental tears but
there are plenty of starlit Italian
nights for all romanticists.
The story of la reine margot
centres on Catholics and the
Protestants in sixteenth century
France. Yes, it's another one of
those arty farty films that people
rarely bother going to see at the
cinema. This is a shame as 'La
Reine Margot' is very entertaining.
The plot revolves around the
royal family; an intriguingly odd set
of characters which includes a
ruthless queen, Catherine de
Medici and her three sons who, as
s ambiguously suggested in the
film, have a dodgy incestuous
relationship with their sister
Margot.
'La Reine Margot' is a violent
film; Catherine de Medici wants to
reconcile the French, and in an
attempt to do so, she orders all
Protestants to be killed. This results
in much blood spilling during what
became known as the Saint
Bartholomew's Day Massacre.
However, Catherine's attempt to
kill Margot's husband with a
poisoned hunting book ("the pages
are stuck together; one needs to
lick one's fingers to turn them")
fails; the book ends up in the hands
of her eldest son, Charles IX. The
effects of the poison are slow and
agonising, resulting in some rather
gruesome scenes where Charles IX
is seen sweating blood.
But, 'La Reine Margot' is also a
ove story; Margot falls in love with
a young man who, because he is a
Protestant must be killed.
Admittedly, this will perhaps be
enjoyed more by the arty farty type
m of cinema goer but even so, if you
U fancy a change to the usual
mainstream stuff, 'La Reine Margot'
comes highly recommended. Q
