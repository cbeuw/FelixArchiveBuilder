Dear Owain ,
We, the undersigned, wish to
register our dismay at the paucity
of Felix newspapers allegedly
distributed by you to the Chemistry
and Biochemistry departments. On
many occasions we have arrived
later on Friday mornings only to
discover that there are - shock
horror - no Felices (plural of FELIX)
in sight! And yet, upon wandering
into another of our Royal College
of Science departments, such as
Physics or Biology, what do we
find? Even on Monday evening as I
write, still these hallowed
departments are blessed with an
abundance of newspapers! oh joy,
oh bliss
[...blah blah blah - ed.]
sort it out!
Yours most grovellingly,
Helen-Louise Windsor

to remain anonymous
I'm sure Owain will be happy to
accept gifts of the monetary variety
to help refresh his mind every Friday
morning at 7:00am (while you are
comfortably tucked up in bed!)
during the distribution rounds so
that he remembers to slip you a few
extras...
Alternatively WAKE UP EARLIER!
.. .And more
again!
Dear Owain ,
Alas I am undone! This Friday past
I once more ventured hesitantly
into my departmental lobby in
search of my weekly dose of
student culture.
But oh! The scenes of horror
and desolation which awaited me.
The vultures had already
descended, consuming the choicest
morsels and leaving nothing but
the skin, meagre fare for a stewing
mind.
And so I must away to more
bountiful pastures, there to take
sustenance from the plethora
remaining
Sir, I beg you dispose this
darken'd cloud and send light
raying across the drear landscape
of our lives. Please leave a few
more copies of your illustrious
publication in the Chemistry and
Biochemistry departments in future.
I thank you,

Dear Mr. wandering-soul
I am indeed sad to hear of your
desperation and so happy to see
that you have mastered the use of a
thesaurus quite so impeccably.
Would you like to come and write
for F E L I X ? This would ensure that
you receive a fresh copy of F E L I X
every week hot off the press! And
you can go home and show your
mummy all those lovely articles and
thoughts you have wrapped up and
waiting to explode on to the pages.
Go on...

Dear Owain,
Currently, entertainments (fondly
known as Ents) are organised by
the Entertainments & Publicity
Manager and although the position
of Ents Chair still exists it remains
unfilled. This may not stay the
same for long as the Union
President intends to destroy this
area of student representation
making it more professionally run.
It is thought that this is already the
case, incorrectly so, by some
people, after being misled at the
last Union Council Meeting. It
seems that we are on the way to
losing a Student Officer with no
one realising - or possibly even
caring? Currently we employ three
ex- or full-time students as our
representatives, we want to
consider "professionalism" of the
way services in the Union are run
then perhaps it would be wiser to
employ two full time members of
staff?
At the moment the two main
decision making bodies of the
Union (i.e: Council and Union
Finance Committee) are letting the
Sabbaticals get away with murder -
very similar to how they did last
year! It takes students caring about
their Union to make things happen
- or stop things being taken away
from them.
Yours sincerely,
Helen Teasdale and Jane Hoyle

Hackerty hack hack!
Sounds to me like someone has
a bee in their bonnet about the
Union's reorganisation. With the
way things are going the Union will
soon be streamlined into a
economically viable business
venture. Small wonder the
devolution of the Ents chair is
imminent.
Not a bad thing either, all it does
is provide service, the cheaper for
the students the better. Does it
really matter whether it's student or
staff run?
Re-entry
Dear Sir,
I would like to take this opportunity
to clarify the position regarding
entrance to Union events. The
numbers of people that we allow in
is determined by the Fire Authority
and is dependent on the fire limit
that they have set on the rooms
that are being used. No-one is
allowed into an event after we
have sold this number of tickets.
We do not operate a 'one out, one
in' policy. This has been agreed
with the local police as they do not
want people in the street waiting
for people to leave. They fear that
this would disturb local residents,
including those students living in
Beit Hall.
While mentioning those living in
Beit, could I remind those students
that regularly attend Union events
that we do ask you to leave the
building quietly so that the
inconvenience to those in Halls is
minimised.
Yours Sincerely,
Dan Look
Deputy President
(Finances and Services)
Money's too
tight to
mention...
Dear Owain,
Reading last terms issues of Felix,
one could not help noticing the
statement given by Ms Chothia on
the subject of Imperial not
belonging to the NUS. She
explained how being a member
would not benefit the Union and
implied we were better off for not
joining.
But what Ms Chothia did not
mention is the loss of benefits to
each individual student through not
having an NUS membership card. I
do not profess to be an expert on
the subject but I have not been
able to ignore the benefits I
personally have had to miss out on.
I have only been a student here
since September but I have already
found that my ICU card does not
bring any discount into showcase
cinemas, or any cinemas in my
home town plus it does not bring
me reductions in any stationners
(although I have not tried in
London branches after being
rebuffed at home) - all of which the
NUS card does. These are just a
couple of examples , and although
they may not seem like much to Ms
Chothia and some students here,
as a student trying to survive on a
grant it is small discounts like these
which would help.
Yours,
L. Grogan
P.S: Production of an NUS card
also gets you free fries at
McDonalds! (when buying a
burger.)
Damn! I'm a veggie.
