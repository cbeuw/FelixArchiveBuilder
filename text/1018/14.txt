The Department of Computing Society is
back on the rails again! A number of events
are in the planning stage including a trip to
CeBIT '95 i n March. Rather than tell you
now, why don't you look at "What's up
DoC?", the DoCSoc magazine? "What's up
D o C ? " is now online (type "Mosaic
/homes/lglb/DocSoc/WUD.html" from within
DoC - we'll get it on the I C U server soon for
you non-DoCers) and it'll hopefully be in
print by the time you read this.
If you have any queries about DoCSoc, feel
free to email lglb@doc.

Of all David Cronenberg's films, which have
included ' T h e F l y ' and 'Scanners',
'Videodrome' is probably his finest achieve-
ment. It concerns a pirate television station
run by a bored Max Renn (James Woods)
who gets drawn into the strange sexual world
of the Videodrome, a show where the deviant
skinflicks are all for real.
Cronenberg's obsessions with 'the new
flesh' run rampant in his characteristic body-
horror style, as an evangelist of the new flesh
cult preaching life after death through video.
Oh, and Debbie Harry gets her kit off in one
of the weirder sex scenes.
'Tetsuo 2: Body Hammer' is a new take
on the theme of bodily absorption of machin-
ery. A n unsuspecting executive is trans-
formed into a living weapon (a body hammer)
by an underground caucus of skinheaded
Archaos rejects.
This follow-up to the original Tetsuo is
basically a more stylish and more easily
understandable remake, which adds to it the
more poetic theme of the beauty to be found
in destruction, whilst retaining the original's
hard-core feel in the violence quotas.
Both films feature themes of bodily cor-
ruption and transfiguration and contain star-
tling images of a new level of existence. Sex
and violence do admittedly crop up fairly
often, but are very unlike the usual cinematic
versions. Fun for all the family!
The films are both on Tuesday, 31st
January starting at 6.15pm i n S T O I C .
Entrance is free to everyone!

On 3rd February,
the Great Hall will be
soaked i n cultural
extravaganza as the
International T a m i l
Society (ITS) goes into
maximum overdrive.
F o l l o w i n g its 1
tremendous success
last year, the I T S has
once again organised
major cultural event to
enrapture students of
Imperial College. There
will be a rich mix of cul-
tural performances
i n c l u d i n g Bharatha
Natyam (dance), the
traditional Veena
recital and band ^
music, Tamil style!
R e f r e s h m e n t s ,
including tasty Tamil
titbits, w i l l also be
available.
The first perfor-
mance will be Bharatha
Natyam (translated as
"dance of India"), the
purest and oldest form of Indian classical
dance. T h e performer dances to the
Nattuvangam (beats) which co-ordinate with
the Salankai Natham (rhythm of the bells)
which are worn on the dancer's feet. The
overall beauty of the dance lies in the blend-
ing of the Bhava (expressions), Raga (music)
and Thala (rhythm) in harmony in order to
communicate to the audience the feelings and
emotions of the dancer.
The Veena is an ancient, divine stringed
instrument which has a mesmerising effect
through its peaceful melodies. The London
Veena Group will be present to provide a top
class performance on six veenas. The veena
music w i l l be complemented by the
miruthangam, moresing and ghatam.
The miruthangam is a percussion instru-
ment made of a wooden trunk and two
leather heads. T h e moresing consists of a
flexible iron strip called the tongue affixed
onto a ring. The ghatam is a clay pot used to
provide rythmic accompaniment and is an
ancient time-keeping instrument.
A renowned T a m i l band will take the
programme to a thrilling finish with Tamil
cinema songs. In this item, both eastern and
western musical instruments will be used to
produce modern Tamil music. We hope you
join us for an evening of great entertainment!
