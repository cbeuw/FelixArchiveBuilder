Frater Fiam writes
Aha! I must take a break from this
self mutilation and write another
column. So witness as I, your good
Frater, lay down my sacred knives
and needles to instead draw out
some spiritual blood, lest my
genuine flow should cause
untoward squeam to my delicate
readers. And what of his life, you
may ask? Well, my friends, the
robes and wands have been laid
down as ritualising takes a more
inner form. I have turned once
more to the jewels of
understanding hidden within the
ancient texts. All is peaceful and
introspective, the macrocosmos
having to take a well earned
second place. And yet it seems that
the world is in an unholy turmoil!
An associate of mine (the
more astute among you may have
deduced by now that your Frater
has only accomplices, acquain-
tances and associates) tried hard to
convince me that one should care
equally for all humans, regardless
of familial or geographical ties.
Though he argued soundly I find it
difficult to realise his ideals, and
feel that they must be flawed; for
even your sincere FF (rugged cynic
though he is) is more shocked by
harm caused to those close, than
to those afar. It seems that such
harm may necessarily cause
personal pain due to the effect it
has on the brain. Each person, and
indeed each concept, is connected
within the mind to countless others
in the form of an 'associational
network'. Damage to someone
close will affect that person's
network. And thus, by the endless
web of memorial connections, does
the knowledge of the relative's
pain afflict the whole of the brain,
and thus all of emotion. Even the
greatest of idealists cannot deny
the relevance of damage to his
own mental structure, the
wounding of his microcosmos.
Such facts were brought to
my awareness by events of afar.
When a distant land is rent apart
the newsmongers bring us
gratuitous images for our sordid
titillation. However those self same
images can also bring the world
closer, and one can discover that
associates are not neighbours, but
may inhabit unknown spaces. In
these instant times, such friends
may inhabit the other side of the
world; yet'they seem as near and
the damage becomes genuinely,
for a shocking moment at least, as
close as that.

Science has been called a religion.
It is claimed that it has a
priesthood, cabalistic knowledge
and provides objective truth. While
I agree with the first two
(priesthood = scientists, cabalistic
knowledge=theorems), there is a
problem in that science does not,
in fact, produce objective truth. For
non-believers, agnostics and
priests to call Science a religion is,
therefore, wrong.
The attack on the claim that
Science produces objective truth is
two-fold. For the word "objective"
we can inspect the more
political/ideological aspects of
Science. It is doubtful, especially in
technology and especially when
Science means funding of millions
of pounds, that there is not an
agenda or a motive. The battle
may be purely political (American
vs Soviet Science) or personal (the
fame of being the first to discover
X). Where the agenda is hidden,
the objectivity is suspect.
More concrete criticisms can
be made of the word "truth". An
idea, a fact, is truthful if it always
holds, whatever the case. But
Science - essentially we are talking
about experimental science - can
only come up with theories via
Induction: Because A holds in all
currently known situations, a
Scientist assumes that A is true.
But this is not the case.
Consider the trivial but illuminating
case of the Inductivist Turkey. At
the start of the year the Turkey was
fed every morning. This happened
under all conditions: on Tuesdays;
when it was sunny; whether young
calves were flown to France or not.
So the Turkey concluded that it
must be true that he would be fed
every morning. This theorem was
true, until the morning of the 25th
of December...
Induction is largely the only
tool at a Scientists disposal. (At
least, that is what all Scientists are
brought up with.) But Induction can
only come up with Provisional
Truth. (There are other problems
with Induction as well, such as the
uncomfortable notion that
Induction as a scientific method
can only be proven by Induction
itself.)
While philosophers of
science have gone on from
Induction as a method towards, for
example, Popper's Conjectures and
Refutations or Lakatos' Proofs and
Refutations, the "priests" of the
"religion" called Science still
practice tricks. This should be
obvious to both priests and masses
alike: Science does not produce
objective truth; Science is not a
religion.
