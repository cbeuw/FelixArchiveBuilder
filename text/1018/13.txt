Last week saw the annual Overseas Week
take place. IC Students from all over the
world presented their culture with stalls in
the JCR. Those who wanted could sample
exotic food, be blinded by the beautiful land-
scapes displayed on posters or be amazed by
curious artifacts.
The event can be deemed as a huge suc-
cess. Most of the Overseas Societies took part
and all managed to provide a colourful dis-
play of their culture. Apart from a few minor
communication problems, both organisers
and participants were happy with the way it
went.
This can be seen as a good omen for the
International Night, the biggest OSC event of
the year, which is due to take place on the 3rd
of March, 1995, for which preparations are
running...

What motivates forty certifiably sane individ-
uals to hurl themselves (and their mortal
souls for the non-secular) from the maw of a
metal bird at 2,000 ft... repeatedly? A height
where everything looks like ants. The follow-
ing piece of investigative journalism will
attempt to answer this question by delving
into the psyches of the Imperial College
Parachute Club - a job not recommended for
the vertiginous or the dyslexic.
f F E L I X 2UIM95
A preliminary survey of elected officials
and fresh-faced recruits of the I P C (these
groups not being mutually exclusive) revealed
a myriad motivations:
Youthful sangfroid? Fatalism? Blinkered
foolhardiness? Illusions of immortality?
Rebellion against societal conformity and
parental authority? Thrill-seeking escape
from suburban monotony? Testing the power
of will over atavistic fears inherited from our
amoebic forebears (after all, evolution allows
most organisms to differentiate up from
down, and generally discourages rapid transi-
tions between the two)? Hmmmm... a more
detailed profile of the IPC members was obvi-
ously called for.
One would be predisposed to presume
that in attendance at a club meeting would be
a large proportion of "my cup runneth over
with testosterone" types in combat boots and
army greens. People for whom Sylvester
Stallone provided a role model for daily life.
Surprise surprise. They appeared not wholly
indistinguishable from typical IC students.
Approximately correct proportions of fresh-
ers, overseas students, the myopic, and ... wait
a minute... there are women in this club? The
chairman is really a chairperson ... called
Catherine? They jump in basketball boots
and jeans? They've heard of K r y s t o f
Kyzlovski's Three Colours Trilogy?
So how did these people end up on an
airfield in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, at
8am on a slightly misty Sunday morn shout-
ing to the heavens: "One one thousand, two
one thousand, three one thousand, four one
thousand, check canopy"? It appeared from
their spread-eagled, backward-arched, legs-
akimbo positions that either a primitive ritu-
al of celestial worship or an arithmetic lesson
for the hard-of-hearing and arthritic was in
progress. O r possibly they were about to
launch themselves from a height three times
that of the Eiffel Tower and trust their well-
being to a single white cord, some elastic
bands, a circular piece of nylon with holes in
it, and several bits of apparatus not germane
to this article but certainly of some gravity
(excuse the pun) to these individuals.
To many of these students, it had been a
simple progression from paying £95 (cheques
accepted but no credit cards please) to becom-
ing a member of the I P C and the British
Parachute Association, enjoying transport in
the commodious IC bus and two nights
accommodation at the Peterborough Airfield
Hilton (showers 50p), receiving a full day's
instruction in how to avoid powerlines,
chicken farms, etc. on the way down, and of
course ... the "first" jump. The static line
descent from 2,000 ft was followed by subsi-
dies for future jumps (conditional on your
surviving the first) such that £11 would be
the toll on your wallet thereafter. No mention
was made of life insurance, or the drafting of
wills to avoid the nasty state of intestacy
(don't worry - it's not catching). Reliance on
Peterborough Parachute Centre having a
Guinness Book of Records entry and the best
safety record in Britain ("No fatalities yet"
they boast) seemed insurance enough.
Hmmmm.
Would it? What did a parachute jump
R E A L L Y involve? Could any fool/IC student
do it? What was it like to freefall for 4 sec-
onds? What did it take to pilot your own air-
craft for 3 minutes - even if it looked like a
distended jellyfish? Was it really better than
sex? What's the answer to Life, the Universe
and other trifles?
For answers to these questions, either
join and jump yourself (meetings in the Table
Tennis Room, t h i r d floor of the U n i o n
Building, Thursdays at 1pm) or wait with
baited breath for the next enthralling episode
in our examination of the IC Parachute Club.
