Security Assaulted Condoms
B Y T E D W . S H I R M A N
F o l l o w i n g an incident i n the
early hours of Saturday morning,
it has emerged that an Imperial
College student is to appear
before the College Disciplinary
Committee charged wit h
punching a security officer. The
alleged assault took place in the
entrance to Beit Quad around
12:30am, and also involved
another person who is not an IC
student.
Observers claim that the
affair started when a group of
students attempted to enter the
Union against the wishes of the
Union stewards. Beit Arch Lodge
security, manned 24-hours a day,
immediately called for assistance
on his security radio. T h i s
resulted in the arrival, moments
later, of additional security
officers who together with the
U n i o n Stewards were able to
persuade the persons in question
to leave.
Terry Briley, Deputy Head
of Security commented that the
Beit Arch Lodge security officer
was very fortunate in that there
was a mobile unit on the corner
of Exhibition Road and Prince
Consort Road.
W h i l e reports from those
present have been forwarded to
the U n i o n , it has not been
established when exactly the
alleged assault took place, or
what punishment the accused
student faces. However, M r
Briley did insist on comp-
l i m e n t i n g those who helped
saying, " I ' d like to express
thanks to the Union stewards for
their promptness and profess-
ionalism."
BY R A C H E L W A L T E R S
Safe sex in the JCR has become a
real possibility with the
installation of three new condom
machines i n the Sherfield
building.
Machines are being installed
in the toilets by the J C R and in
the gents round the back of the
security office on the ground
floor.
Commenting on the news,
Annie Mathewman, I C U Welfare
Officer said that she was pleased
that college had responded to the
Union request. "There's no point
in shouting off about safe sex if
college don't do anything about
it," she said.

budget allocations, resulting in a
considerable effect on its
running costs. It is also difficult
to see what the benefits of N U S
membership would be to a C C U
since student bars and catering
are managed by ICU.
Representatives from the
N U S w i l l be at college on
February 3rd, 7th and 10th as
part of the consultation period as
I C U reconsiders its status. The
financial details are still being
examined by u n i o n officials,
although it has been suggested
that if the affiliation cost can be
negotiated down, I C U could
make considerable savings on
the cheaper alcohol that the
N U S , as one of the largest
buying groups in the country,
could supply.

Shot through the foot
When I planned the letters page I
wanted to make more lively and
'instant' and hoped to receive a
large mailbag. As the number of
letters has not really increased
this year, I can only question
why. Two things seem possible.
Firstly, to avoid a 'voice of
god' feel I've had different people
edit the letters page every week. I
reasoned that the letter's editor
would be i n almost the same
position as the writer. Have
people been put off because of
fear of being outwitted or even
attacked i n print? Secondly, I
decided to give the letter's editor
a virtually free hand in what they
wrote. When I've disagreed my
only option has been to argue
with the letter's editor and/or let
it go. T h i s week is a good
example. Helen and Jane's letter
concerning the Ents manager
raises an issue which David has
dismissed without considering
what he's written. The loss of
every bit of student control is
important. When there were still
large numbers of the 'hacks' that
David dismisses, they were the
butt of many jokes but nowadays
anyone who takes an interest in
the U n i o n seems more like a
worthy lone crusader. There are
precious few left.
A n d to the people who ask
for more F E L I C E S i n
Chemistry, I shall do my best and
thank you for your interest!
Serious Cat?
Not only have I worried about
the letters page but a couple of
people have said that F E L I X is
becoming a little too serious.
W h i l s t I won't censore out
articles by people with something
important to say, I am open to
new voices. If you have any ideas
for funny features or even
Pythonesque antics beyond my
imagining than please come in. If
you can lend a hand in producing
them than that's even better.
However, I offer the follow-
ing joke as a temporary measure:
A miserable man by the
name of Paul, who had been
disadvanataged since birth by his
imperfectly proportioned head,
inhabited a small dwelling on the
fifth floor of a fifty floor building.
It was situated i n an area of
extreme hardship, having suff-
ered many a tory rate-capping in
the years gone by but anyway one
day Paul woke to a knocking.
Instead of thinking how lucky he
was, as latest reports indicate that
2.8% of human beings do not
wake in the morning and in fact
die i n their sleep, a tragedy we
should all ponder and write
articles about, he instead rushed
to answer the door. (This was of
course foolish - most break-in
victims let in the assailiants. The
shotgun at the door lock is a
myth). He arrived, as I have
stressed and opened it, without
even using his door chain.
"Hello?" he enquired. There
was no reply. Paul shouldn't have
been suprised - he was displaying
gross language-centric insens-
itivity in expecting the person at
the door to respond conveniantly
in his own native tongue. Then
Paul closed the door.
He went back to switch on
his television and waste several
hours i n a brain-soddening
exercise ( D i d he ever consider
something else, such as learning
the flute or perhaps taking up a
new sport? He did not).
Paul was roused from his
revery by a further knocking at
the door. He was very angry on
rising, which was foolish of him.
He should have learnt to manage
stress at an earlier age, what with
all the cruel insults he had to
endure due to his head size.
He arrived at the door once
more. Foolishly he again adopted
none of the security measures we
suggested in paragraph one.
" H e l l o ? " he asked again.
Rather than arrogantly slamming
the door once more, he looked a
little further and noticed a small
snail innocently perched on the
'Welcome Home' mat.
A n g r i l y , and showing
extreme phylumism. (The belief
that one's own class of organism
is inherently superior to another
because of the supposed greater
sophistication of its body plan),
he booted the snail at the wall
opposite and slammed the door.
Time went by. Paul spent his
time i n front of mirrors and
changing channels, occassionaly
going for a (time consuming) hair
cut. One day his aimless
existance was interrupted by a
knocking at the door.
"Hello?" Paul enquired.
"What did you do that for?"
replied the snail at his feet.
