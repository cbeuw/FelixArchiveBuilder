Orienteering
IC vs Everyone Else
Last Sunday's event was at
Walthamstow, so we had a lie in
and got the tube. Walthamstow
on a cold, wet and windy
morning Sunday morning was
not everyone's idea of fun, but we
all staggered round a course.
On the Brown course,
William was only beaten by 3
minutes by the women's world
silver medallist. On the Blue,
Andy managed to avoid being
beaten by Carol, with Shao Wei
close behind. David and Mark
both posted fast times on Red and
Kristin did well on Green.
Highlights of the day - run-
ning through knee-high water in
the underpass and lunch at
McDonalds!
If you want to try
Orienteering, we meet at 6pm
Wednesdays at the Union Gym
for training or 8pm at Southside
Upper Lounge for tall stories.

IC Ladies vs Royal Vets
The awful country air had
adverse affects on match play
with quick tries being conceded ,
early on. Some cracking tackles
by all and there was also a great
display of unending
determination considering the
appaling weather, and nasty
injuries. Our only try was by
Sarah Handley.
The forward of the match was
Lynsey Hewitt, and the back of
the match was Julia Donovan.
All performed very well, and
most importantly kept the spirit
up. Next match we'll snot them
properly!

IC 1st vs No-one else (QMW)
THIS IS T H E NEWS.
Last Wednesday's event, at Mile
End Stadium Nachos Grande
(extra cheese) was an inspiration
to no-one at all. We got the
trolley and had a well deserved lie
down. We shan't mention the
weather. On the green astroturf
we lost badly, but on the Fantasy
Brown (capital colours) pitch we
posted some letters but were
denied by the postie. Carol didn't
play, but did very well.
If you want to join us on the
fantasy Hockey pitch, meet us at
the corner of the underpass and
43rd street. Bring your trunks.
IC Ladies 2nd vs Baits 2nd
Yet another stunning victory for
IC Ladies. Total domination of
the game throughout. A hat-trick
for Miss One Hand Wonder, two
goals for Prim & Proper and one
for Space Cadet - perhaps made
easier by a goalkeeper who forgot
she was wearing 'kickers' and
tried to stop the ball with her
stick. Storming play all round,
even for Slave (goalie) who
touched the ball only once. Many
thanks to all our supporters. Post
match comment: "We're the
best!"
Ed's Bit (ooer)
In a week of contant rain, no-one
mentions the weather - still, that's
the Englishfor you. Thanks to
everyone who submitted reports,
especially the more legible ones. It's
nice to have some sports reports on
the back page again!

After an inspiring psyche by Bill T.C. the team was 4-0 up in ten
minutes with goals from Son of Rent Boy, Alexi Lalas, Bigot &
