two London university students were already
in Burkina doing an anthropology project.
"There were one or two tourists from Spain,"
added Peter. " W e still had high novelty
value," said Iain. "When we went somewhere,
all the children would chase after us saying
'Nsara Nsara', which means 'white man' ".
Life expectancy for the Burkinabe is 46
years for men and 49 for women. With safe
drinking water available to only half the
population, gastrointestinal disease and
malaria are the main causes of death, while
leprosy, meningitis and worms are also
common. "We were really more involved i n
the spiritual aspects of things, but we were
able to build some water storage barrels,"
explained Peter. "We painted them inside and
out and so the village can store water i n
them."
"Medical things are hard to get hold of
and they're very expensive," he went on. "It's
quite easy to get i l l out there". T h e
missionaries themselves weren't immune. "I
got very sick after two weeks," said Steven. "I
think it was amoebic dysentery - I was
passing blood and mucus on the hour every
feature
hour for about a week. In the end I lost half a
stone". Steven described his luck that a doctor
from another missionary organisation had
given h i m a course of antibiotics. In
Ouagadougou there is a local hospital, but as
Steven explained: " Y o u don't want to go to
the hospital unless you want to get very ill.
You'd certainly be wise to bring your own
syringes".
Only a tenth of Burkina's land is arable,
on which must be grown the food crops of
sorghum (a grassy crop like sugar cane),
millet, corn, rice and sweet potatoes. "One of
the things that struck us was that they don't
have the extraordinarily wide diet that we
have. We take for granted the variety of foods
that are available," said Iain, adding "It's not
so much that they don't have enough to eat,
it's more malnutrition".
"Most of our meals were rice and
sauce," explained Steven. "They don't have
much meat, but we went to a village outside
Ouagadougou and the church there gave us
meat almost every meal. At the end they gave
us three chickens. Even though they had so
little they were so generous". C u l i n a r y
customs turned out to be slightly different,
however: "They cooked the whole chicken,
feet, head, everything. We... er... didn't eat the
head," confessed Steven.
The three flew to Africa with the
Russian airline Aeroflot, giving them the
chance to spend three days i n Moscow on
their way home. " T h e Russian orthodox
churches are very different", said Steven.
"There was this haunting, beautiful music and
the high priest i n his hat. Everyone stands
and listens and the service is done by singers.
We didn't understand a word except amen.
It's a big contrast to the Burkina churches,
where everyone is jumping up and down, but
there we could understand when they said
'amena' ".
It seems that some things are the same
all over the world. (3
