Sandy Kidd
Who IS he? Engineer/inventor
Background? Graduated from the 'garden shed'
university of life.
What did he diSCOUer? The Kidd antigravity
machine.
...Ulhich IS? A pair of gyroscopes, angularly set and rotating centrifugally...whilst
allowing upward movement.
...pardon? You'd have to read the book.GJ
So what S the problem? Newton's third law of motion (every force applied must
have an equal and opposite reaction). His critics said that it would have to defy
Newton's third law to work, as no opposing force is produced. But supporters
(Prof. Laithwaite, ex-IC) reckon that it exploits a loophole in the law. Newton's
law is applied to bodies either travelling in a straight line or rotating, not both.
After many years trying to convince the establishment, the Australians whisked
him off for development. He has since provided scientifically rigorous evidence
for his device. The real barrier to acceptance is that no one knows how it works.
WhatUllll happen? When there is a mechanism, the phrase 'the sky's the limit' will
probably have to be rewritten for Kidd. Aside from speedy space travel and
pollution free transport, the applications are mindblowing. Either way, Kidd
will have the last laugh. Then there will be books, films, pencil casess...

Who IS he? geophysiologist/inventor
Background? Professor, FRS. Whilst at NASA he
successfully predicted that Mars would be life-
less because its atmosphere was at chemical
equilibrium.
LUhat did he discover? The GAIA hypothesis
...UlhlchlS? The idea that Earth's biota evolves to maintain conditions for life.
...pardon? You'd have to read the book. CO
So Ulhat S the problem? Darwin's theory of natural selection. Opponents to
Lovelock say that individual organisms would have to act teleologicaly (with
predetermined design or purpose) and non-selfishly. Lovelock argues that
individuals can benefit by making local climate alterations (such as retaining
water or reflecting sunlight). And that something must be maintaining the
Earth's climate, as the Sun's output has increased by 30% since the Earth's ori-
gin. A computer simulation looks promising but will not yet convince the cyn-
ics.
WhatuJlll happen? When a mechanism is established parts of Lovelock's hypoth-
esis look feasible. But ecological theory takes a lot longer to test, prove and
accept than physics. Lovelock has a long wait.
