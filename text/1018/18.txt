myograph - ferns [1923]
m a n ray was one of the few
people to bring photography above
the realm of mere image and into
true art. He is famed for a few
classic images, such as the female
whose back becomes transformed
into a violin. However, his work
extended far beyond that, and the
full extent of it can be seen at the
nearby Serpentine gallery. The work
on show presents something of the
enigma that the artist became.
Born of the early Parisian
surrealists, Man Ray's work is
indebted to the surreal ethos, and
yet seems far beyond it. His
photographs have a pure and
timeless quality that gives them an
air of being almost beyond art©.
Perhaps something higher, or
perhaps something more base,
such as a billboard ad. The images
on show cross the whole span of
his work, from his metamorphosed
figures to portraits, paintings,
sculptures and more. Although this
range is broad, all of the works are
tied together by the strange,
indefinable quality that character-
sed Man Ray's work. Really, the
only true way to describe him is as
an experimenter. Always trying out
ideas, he became the inventor of
various photographic techniques.
His rayographs are shadowy
recreations made without a
camera, and his solarising tech-
nique lends a detached, almost
holocaustic air to his nudes.
However I feel that the true nature
of Man Ray's character can only be
understood by looking at his
portraits. They are the most
straightforward of his photographs,
but also the most human and
creative of his works. Those on
display at the Serpentine are the
real highlight of the show; not only
are they superb but they represent
a veritable artistic hall of fame. All
of the surrealists are there along
with other painters, poets and
writers. Marcel Duchamp gazes out
alongside Picasso and Matisse,
whilst a stern Miro stands by a
string of pearls. Marcel Proust lies
on his death bed and at the end is
Man Ray himself, bleached by the
solarizing glare of his own
penetrating lens. Q

Yet another single taken from
'superunknown'. If you've

Otherwise get the album
instead as it is packed with
songs as good as this.

The Wonderstuff might have

cop shoot cop - any day now
These are unlike any other
band, mixing grunge and punk
in a unique way to create
beautiful songs. Another
strongly recommended band.
belly - now they'll sleep
First single from the new
album and this is bit
disappointing from Tanya and
co for the simple fact that they
don't seem to have evolved
since the last record.

Carter still haven't changed;
catchy lyrics, good tune and a

or you don't.

Yet another adorable single
from Sleeper, a band who
seem to make a habit of
writing beautiful pop songs.
