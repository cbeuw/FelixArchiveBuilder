Arson Attack
BY A N D R E W L O N G
Arsonists have been blamed for
two fires w h i c h last term
wrecked havoc with festive
celebrations at Linstead H a l l .
The fires took place on Tuesday
13th December, just a few days
after the Linstead Christmas
party.
In the first of the two
incidents, fire alarms were
activated at 9.05pm, after foyer
smoke alarms were triggered. M r
S. Patel, who was the first at the
scene, discovered an ignited
newspaper and a b u r n i n g
armchair under the foyer stairs.
Whilst removing the armchair
he was joined by college security
who extinguished the flames.
The second event took place
shortly after 10pm. On smelling
smoke i n her flat, resident
Sharine Brown rose the alarm.
College security arriving on
staircase 3 found that the
lighting had been switched off
and the staircase smoke-ridden.
The fire brigade were called
whilst security and assistant
warden Andy Livingston used a
hose reel to extinguish the
flames. Following investigations
at the scene police and fire
officials have concluded that
arsonists were to blame.
T e r r y Briley, Deputy
Security Manager, expressed
great dissatisfaction with the
behaviour of those responsible.
However, he was impressed by
the rapid evacuation of the
building. "Everybody responded
extremely well; the fires could
have been serious if not fatal," he
said.
Jan Bradley, Warden of
Linstead H a l l , also praised
peoples' efforts: "Considering
the party atmosphere, and the
high spirits, the situation was
tackled well under the
circumstances."
Although nobody was hurt
in the incidents, the fires raise
some serious safety questions.
Fire alarms are due to be fitted
in all rooms in Linstead but this
has been pending for some years.
The last major accomodiation
fire occured three years ago
following a chip pan fire i n
Garden H a l l , after w h i c h an
upgrade to the fire safety system
in Southside, Weeks and
Linstead Halls was implimented.
But, though the Linstead fire
system was upgraded during
1994, half a year later, the smoke
alarm system remains
unfinished.
New Constitution
B Y A N D R E W L O N G
Imperial College U n i o n (ICU)
has a new constitution after the
bulk of it was passed by the
Governing Body at the end of
last term. But parts of it have
caused complications, the 'Mary's
Ammendment' has itself been
ammended after the Governing

Mark Home is the new I C U Events and Marketing Manger, writes Jon
Jordan. Mark, 27V2, is a business and adminstration studies graduate of
Salford University and was Ents manager at Salford for four years and
Greenwich for six months before moving to Imperial. "It's a totally
new thing for me," said Mark, "coming to a place that's a) respected
and b) has a history".
When asked about his vision for the future, the self confessed
"cross between Terry Christian and Boy George" replied "I personally
reckon that we're about eight or nine tenth of the way to getting
everything sorted as it needs to be sorted". He also hoped that in the
future there would be more clubs and society and overseas student
involvement in the Union. "As a union we know a lot more about
running events than a lot of students appreciate" he continued, "we
also need to try and change people's perceptions of union events".
Ents kick off the New Year tonight with the Carnival in the Union
building.
