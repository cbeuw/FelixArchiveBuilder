Union Move Considered
B Y M I C H A E L L U D L A M
The U n i o n could move to
Sherfield within three years if a
college feasibility study is
successful. The speed at which
the plans are moving forward has
surprised Union staff who when
first approached were told that a
move could not be achieved i n
less than five years.
Dan L o o k , Deputy
President (Finance & Services)
admitted: "We've found out it is
not as long term as first
anticipated." The reduced time
frame was explained by Ian
Caldwell, Director of Estates,
who said that it was intended
that the work on Sherfield would
be completed at the same time as
the new medical b u i l d i n g i n
1998. However, both college and
union officials stress heavily that
the plans produced so far are for
a feasibility study which will be
completed at the end of this
month. "The feasibility study is
there to demonstrate whether
creating a sort of academic-social
space is feasible and what it
might cost," said M r Caldwell.
He added: " I f we are going to
attract students i n the future
we've got to create the right
facilities for them."
On being shown tentative
plans for a move to Sherfield,
U n i o n staff have found many
problems w i t h the design. In
particular, i n i t i a l sketches
suggest that the need for a union
bar has almost been neglected,
only showing it as a small space
on the third floor. "We're not too
keen on having a bar on the
third floor," said Dan Look. He
added that i f a space on the
ground floor was found then this
would "attract" the union to a
move.
Already, assurances given at
the beginning of last term seem
to have been changed. Moving
the Union Dining Hall and the
Union Bar, "panel by panel" to a
new union building is proving
unfeasible. "I don't see how it
would work," said the Deputy
President (Finance & Services),
he added that they would remain
in their present positions. There
have also been concerns as to
whether Union catering would
be able to compete with college
catering.
The plans presently include
a bookshop w h i c h the U n i o n
would r u n and other retail
outlets: the provisional plans
show a Tower Records store. The
central light wells i n the
Sherfield b u i l d i n g would go.
They would be replaced by a
large hall with tiered seating and
partition walls to provide more
rooms. If, as has been suggested,
the U n i o n were also given
control of the Great Hall, then
this would give the Union two
large seated venues. B u t this
would not necessarily be
beneficial for the Union since it
tends to request lots of small
rooms at once. D a n L o o k
admitted that it was, "hard to see
how we would get everything to
work". Other ideas for the
central lightwell space would be
to turn it into a nightclub venue,
similar to Tutu's at K i n g ' s
College, with a bar above looking
down.
FELIX understands that not
all of the administration staff are
keen on a U n i o n move to
Sherfield. They will have to be
won over by the proposers of the
scheme if it is to go ahead. It
may be that in the new Sherfield
b u i l d i n g the college admin-
istration will be smaller both in
size and staff numbers.
The Union are still pushing
for a feasibility study to look at
how Beit Quad could be
improved as a student area away
from the rest of college. In a
promise to students M r Look
said that students would be
consulted and that a referendum
was, "not something we would
rule out".

Body at the end of last term. But
parts of it have caused
complications, the ' M a r y ' s
A m e n d m e n t ' has itself been
amended after the Governing
Body found some of the wording
unsuitable for inclusion i n the
long term constitution.
At the U n i o n General
Meeting last November, Claire
M o l o n e y , St M a r y ' s H o s p i t a l
Medical School Student Union
President, passed an amendment
w h i c h made M a r y ' s U n i o n
financially responsible to
medical school officials. It also
separated Mary's funding from
ICU's until the medical school
moved from Paddington to
South K e n s i n g t o n . A l l other
Constitutent College Unions are
financially responsible to the
Deputy President (Finance &
Services).
However, it was decided that
measures which would probably
require the constitution be
amended at a later stage should
not be written into the
document. Also removed was the
Mary's U n i o n financial
exception w h i c h took
S M H M S S U out of the
responsibility of the Deputy
President (Finance & Services).
T h e amendment was
introduced after students were
concerned that the finances of
Mary's Union would be decided
by mostly non-Mary's students.
A c c o r d i n g to the G o v e r n i n g
Body, these concerns have been
addressed i n the revised clause.
Under this revised clause Mary's
U n i o n w i l l have a separate
earmarked subvention 'for such
period as the Governing Body
shall determine'. It is to be
administered and accounted for
under 'arrangements approved
by the Rector'.
T h o u g h , under this new
clause, Mary's Union could be
forced to be immediately
financially accountable to ICU, it
is understood that College
officials w i l l delay any such
measures u n t i l after medics
move onto the South Kensington
campus.
Professor Peter Richards,
Dean of St M a r y ' s H o s p i t a l
Medical School, commented: "I
