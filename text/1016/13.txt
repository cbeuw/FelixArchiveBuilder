Wes Craven's nightmares seem to
have a persistence quality about
them. Okay so he only directed
the first Elm Street slasher but now
by returning to that scene he only
manages to show how uncontroll-
able the monster he unleashed
has become.
The new nightmare is a kind
of twist on the old. This time the
original actors are set in the real
world and play themselves;
Heather Langenkamp screams for
her son, Wes Craven's filmwriting
is autodirected by his dreams
whilst Robert England is seemingly
drawn towards the bloodlust of
Freddy Krueger. It's a nice touch,
breaking into the dualism of the
actor-character and then trying to
squeeze both of them together but
in the case of this film series it
only gets lost as Freddy reappears
to carve up more flesh and blood.
It's a problem which seems to
haunt the genre. Horror films are
suppose to scare us and if they
don't they become wearisome,
however cleverly the director
weaves his tale.
Yet the opening scenes are
clever and scary - a horror film
within a horror film based in real
life. This blurred aspect of reality
continues to be used with effect as
we slip between dreams and
waking, earthquakes of the
physical and metaphysical,
Englund playing Freddy for the
talkshow and Freddy playing ...
well, himself. But it is significant
that these scenes are scary
because they are based on
psychological edgings and hence
are virtually bloodless. By the time
that fingers have become firm
blades you just have to lay back
and endure the usual cliched cut
and thrust of leaving the kid alone
at the crucial moment, the clumsy
jabs of the supposedly powerful
villai.n which always just miss the
heroine, the crucial 'child
sleepwalking across a six lane
highway without being hit' scene
and then on to the MFI inspired
seven gates of hell set where the
final battle has to interminably
work its way around to farce as
Freddy gets killed (once again,
again, again, again, again ...). As
the film's marketing goes; "...
missed me?". Sadly I hadn't
noticed that you'd ever been
away.
She was an abnormal child
that was certain and you might
have thought her disadvantaged
but Sissy Hankshaw's thumbs were
to be her salvation. She was born
for a purpose and that purpose was
to hitchhike.
The opening sentiments of
even cowgirls get the blues are
obviously surreal and equally
satisfying especially when vocalised
in Uma Thurman's slow stumble.
That the rest of the film doesn't live
up to the ideal maybe simply
because books rarely make good
films, especially new age road
books. Personally I didn't find the
book that great either - Tom
Robbins tends to be too self
congratulatory and knowing an
author for my palate. Still plot, feel
and emotional depth aside the film
had all the makings for a cult
classic - Gus van Sant's direction,
kd lang's soundtrack, Uma
Thurman, Rain Phoenix and John
Hurt in the major roles (the latter in
drag as the vaginal deodorant
queen of america), River Phoenix as
the deceased dedication and
William Burroughs as the ten
second cameo of New York. Even
the title is a sly reference to
masturbation although this is
upgraded by the time the action
goes down on the range as the
cowgirls are all apparently lesbian
(or at the least bisexual). But all this
was before the film was shot and
subsequently heavily re-edited.
Reality can be a bitch.
There's a saying I've always
liked: "life is first draft". Means
you don't get to do any rewrites or
rehearsals, and most of the time
you just have to make it up as you
go along. That's real life for you.
Hal Hartley's films are like
that too - not so much the product
of craft as a brief window onto
someone's life, in all its messy,
amateurish glory. Hartley's
naturalistic style of directing gives
his work an emotional force you
just can't ignore; funny and
poignant by turns, his four films to
date have made a virtue of their
low budget origins and each one
is worth any ten blockbusters
you'd care to mention.
Which brings us to Hartley's
latest effort, amateur, which is
something of a departure both in
subject matter and the size of the
production. It's still a long way
from Hollywood standards, but
amateur is easily Hartley's most
ambitious project to date. It's also
(shock, horror) an action movie -
but as the man says "it's a Hal
Hartley action movie and that
probably means I've got it wrong
somehow".
The story starts with Thomas,
an amnesiac who wakes up in a
New York alley, with no ID and no
idea how he got there. He meets
Isabelle, an ex-nun who earns a
living by writing pornography
(honest, I'm not making this up)
and together they begin to unravel
the mystery of Thomas' past. But
what link does he have with Sofia,
a desperate young porn actress
who seems terrified of him, and
why are the mob trying to kill him?
As per usual, Hartley uses the plot
as a vehicle to explore important
themes of responsibility and love.
Can we love someone who has
been 'evil' in the past even if they
are, quite literally, a changed
man?
Amateur is every bit as funny
as Hartley's previous work, while
the action scenes are also well-
handled, but the real attraction is
the compellingly realised
relationships between the main
characters - Hartley is known as
an actors' director, and the
excellent performances he pulls
from the talented cast show us
why. A joy to watch. Â©
