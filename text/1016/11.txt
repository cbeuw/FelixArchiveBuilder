In keeping with the timely festivities, next
Monday, January 16th, is the Jewish New
Year for Trees. It is one of the Four New
Years in the Jewish calendar, marking differ-
ent aspects of life, mentioned i n the
Mishnah, the Oral Law. From this day the
age of trees were calculated, which deter-
mined when the trees' fruit would be given as
part of the "First Fruits" sacrifice i n the
Temple in Jerusalem. The timing of the new
year is appropriately chosen as this is the
time when the plants are revived and the sap
begins to flow again, and the trees re-embark
on their fruit-bearing cycle. It is customary to
eat new fruits as well, as this is the agricultur-
al new year.
On Thursday 19th January, at 12pm in
the Management School, Mrs. Myrna Glass is
coming to talk to the Jewish Society on the
topic of "Water, water everywhere, but can
we drink it?". Come along on January 19th,
bring a new fruit and find out!
For more information contact Sarah
Waiman, Chem Eng 2 or s.waiman@ic.ac.uk.
The Jewish Society costs £3.50 to join theyear.
