British television is still, by far, the best in the world but for how long? As viewing figures
fall again, C a r l o M a s s a r e l l a explores why people are turned off by the box.
Y
f ou're probably too busy
recovering from the side-
effects of Christmas to
remember what you watched on
television during the festivities -
if anything at all, that is.
For 1994 has not been a
good year for this home
entertainment system. Viewers
have deserted the box hi favour til
other fornix of amusement -
partaking i n the new wave of
'danger-sports', entering .jjjjl
techno-world of C D - R O M s or
reverting to the age old ti\idit|»ji
of curling up with a good book.
For television is \isi becoming a
big turnoff for in my people.
Critics lij htlj panned
B B C 1 and I T V b i g bosses for
their complete lack o f imag-
ination when it came to yuletide
offerings; recording an extra]

the camera, and tacking th$3$0jd-

pensioners were watching it than
18 to 25 year olds, and Desmond
Lynam attempted to educate the
nation, in a tabloid type of way,
by asking ' H o w D o T h e y D o
That?'
It was the year in which T V
bosses regrettably ignited the fuse
w h i c h led to an explosion of
female fronted chat/despair
shows. These daily doses of
desperation, depositing P M T and
depression all over the country,
are a prime example of how
derived all stations output is
becoming.
It seemed to be a year when
the bottom line of the 'quality
threshold' d i d not matter
anymore; Equity cards temp-
orarily lost their validity
following the launch of the
' N a t i o n a l L o t t e r y L i v e ' prog-
ramme, Carlton launched a late
night soap opera that typified
everything that was ever wrong
and could possibly go wrong in
T V drama and I T V repackaged

and brought i n a presenter for
£ l m in order to produce another
we'll do our best to
M y « H ^ general purpose
programme called 'Scholfield's
Quest'.
But ' P a r a n o r m a l ' was
certainly the buzzword of 1994
with 'real case close encounters'
being reconstructed i n a large
scale 'attempt' to explain the
inexplicable. The more worthy
novelties on this subject being
'The X Files', which emerged
TWRI the 81$% cabinet and fast

and 'Weird Night'
aryone who watched

pffict thUpQddle in the micro-
wave scene.
With (he exception of a few
V i n e ablpe mentioned, it is clear
that television today is stuck in a
rut of blatant repackaging and
repetition of tired formats, and far
WO much red tape. The days of
innovation on I T V were aban-
doned long ago with the station
veering towards stripping soap-i-
fied, formulaic drama and
unbearably Americanised Game
Shows across its schedules. But
the B B C has not got the
commercial pressures of ITV, and
should therefore give its
consumer a wider choice of qual-
ity programmes that are not
exploited by other channels.
The warning signs of 'the
tired viewer' have never been
more evident; the big switch-off
has begun. For innovation, diver-
sity, entertainment and educ-
ation, do what more people did
this Christmas than ever before -
buy a book.
