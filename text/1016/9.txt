range of human hearing alerts them) and
'refuse' to record it. O f course, professional
thieves can nearly always use technology
sidestep these limitations, e.g. Videotapes are
encoded using 'MacroVision' to deter would
be pirates but the clever ones use a piece of kit
called a sync convertor to get around this.
Lee was also unsure that retrieval times
would be getting much faster in the next few
years, especially internationally. Anyone
wanting fast data transfer needs a more
expensive l i n k such as the Superjanet
backbone that IC sits on. Ultimately, heavy
investment is needed to get real speed. Lee:
"To do cute tricks you need to lay cables".
So we have a potentially revolutionary
technology, only that no sooner does it appear
on the horizon then it seems to be riding a
donkey. Perhaps the reticence the music
industry has shown is justifiable. Between the
lack of copy protection and the slow access
times, it may be a little premature to throw
away your Tower Record vouchers. Could it
really be the end of the high street retail trade?
"It's certainly possible," says E m m a
Ffanning of the BPI, the meeting point of the
record company world. " O b v i o u s l y the
industry hasn't looked at it enough to decide
what the effects are going to be but it could
dramatically change things."
Emma, who thought that "this year
companies are really seriously beginning to
look at at it [the Internet] and get their act
together" also advised me to phone a company
called Cerberes who, in her opinion, were the
furthest advanced in the provision of on-line
music. I spoke to Ricky Adar, a man who
believes his company has cracked the
encryption problem. It relies on the fact that
they have pulled off quite a coup:
"We've got an agreement with National
Westminster Bank to collect credit card
details through the Internet now," says Ricky,
" A n d to the best of our knowledge we are
probably the first company in the world to get
an agreement from a national bank."
Basically the system works as follows.
The user sends his credit card details to the
Cerebes server in Denmark street, which then
returns a personal player encrypted with the
users credit card details, name and address
'burnt' into it. Every
s u b s e q u e n t
soundfile that's
downloaded is
encrypted to ones
own player. Thus
music can only be
exchanged by also
giving away your
player, which amounts to giving away your
credit card details! (This kind of 'Personal
Protection' scheme cunningly protects the
companies interest by putting your person on
the line!)
But what about Lee's point suggesting
one could always tap into the sound on the
way to the speakers? He misses step for a
moment then:"You could probably do that,
yeah. We're of the opinion that as we make it
difficult for people to clone... [to distribute the
resultant copy] you'd need your own
compressor to do that. Our audio compressor
that is coming out is 15:1."
Ricky claims they have had considerable
industry interest, and have signed the largest
" T h e s e a r e a r t i s t s
a n d i f t h e y d o n ' t
e a t t h e y s t o p
m a k i n g m u s i c ! "
independent label in the US. At the sharp end
then, does he see this as the end of the retail
trade? "Long term, yes. We've just spent five
billion pounds cabling up every street i n
London. What's going to happen to it? It's
going to have on-line services on it of course."
Cerebes are reluctant to reveal a web
address because, says Ricky, "As soon as we
put up details that we are offering a Credit
Card clearing service - we know that the
whole of the net is waiting for it so we know
we are going to get deluged."
More than supplying music, they see
themselves setting up a
structure that will be able to
cope with realtime sound
transmission, possibly only
twelve months away. Users
with free cable calls w i l l
thus use it as a jukebox.
But R i c k y strongly
disagrees with the Net
ethics of no-cost free produce. "If people want
to charge for their produce they should be able
to charge for it. These are artists and if they
don't eat, you know what I mean, they stop
making music!" He disagreed with what he
refers to as 'the L . A crowd' saying that the
Cerebes system brings money back to bands
faster than ever before. A n d "for two hundred
pounds a year [the cost of a putting up a
single, a biog and a graphic] you can set
yourself up as a record label."
With I U M A also hoping to use credit
card sales on the net - to sell real C D ' s
through the post - the old net values of death
before commercialism seem dead.
Long live Rock and Roll!
