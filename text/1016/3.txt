what everyone would have
wanted but its an acceptable
compromise."
The G o v e r n i n g Body's
revised amendment must now be
passed by the new I C U Council
before it can finally be included
into the constitution. However,
Lucy Chothia, I C U President, in
an interview with F E L I X stated
that the new amendment
basically was a rewording of the
old proposal and that she did not
see Council having any problems
with it.
The first new I C U Council
meeting w i l l take place on
Tuesday 17th January.

Sir E r i c A s h , ex-Rector of
Imperial College, has been
appointed acting Chief Executive
of the Student Loans Company.
He took over the position,
which is on a part time basis, on
16 December. The job was
previously held by Ron Harrison,
who is absent owing to ill health.
Sir Eric's task will be aided by
Colin Ward, Assistant Managing
Director of the Glasgow-based
company, who will continue to
deal with day-to-day operational
details. Sir Eric w i l l be
continuing i n the post u n t i l
further notice.
The Company, owned by the
Secretaries of State for Education
and Scotland, was set up to
administer the Government's
much-maligned student loans
scheme. Recently, the scheme has
come under attack from both
student bodies and the
opposition parties. Government
figures from February 1994
showed that more than a third of
graduates liable to make loan
repayments had been forced to
defer payments because of low
income.
Sir E r i c , who joined the
Company in September 1994 as a
non-Executive D i r e c t o r , was
Rector of Imperial College from
1985 to 1993. H e is currently
Professor of Physics at University
College, London. The Company
Chairman, K e n Young, described
him as having "a distinguished
academic career", and said that
"his management experience as a
director and consultant will be an
invaluable asset".

Two Thousandths
Ah, another year is upon us. But
behind the complacency which
comes with maturity (remember
the trauma that came w i t h
changing from 1983 to 1984
brought to your schoolbooks?)
there is a feeling, I think, of an
importance to count time almost
hourly. We are now only five
years from the Millennium and
that long awaited Timemark that
stirs both the souls of believers
and hearts of the cynics. We may
say that the year 2000 is a purely
human invention unnoticed by
the cosmos but one cannot live in
the world of calendars and escape
without a trace. Our concept of
time may be arbitrary but it
permeates to the core.
Despite, or because, of our
obsession, it is difficult to obtain
any real sense of perspective. I
think the Millennium will now
be much more on the minds of
the chattering classes because we
are 'half way there.' B y this I
mean halfway between 1990 and
2000, which is how many people
seem to view things. N o b o d y
really says we've seen
1995/2000'ths of the allotted time
float under the bridge. But why
say 2000 at all? In 2100 they'll be
looking towards the year 3000 or
floating around as dust particles.
Or maybe they'll be measuring
time with some weird form of
'quantum clock' and the
Christian Calendar will be all but
forgotten.
Over the Channel
It was with such weighty
thoughts on my mind that I went
to Holland over the New Years
Break (yeah really, nothing to do
with Amsterdam'ned hedonism!)
Actually, maybe it's a product of
my years without travel but I do
find going to new countries an
exhilarating experience. When
people talk about how the
European capitals, for instance,
are all the same, I can only get
nostalgic because i f they are
similar now, what must they have
been once? I find countries
bristling with a subtle
uniqueness, which might not be
as obvious as a weird hat or a
plate of some local long-lost
delicacy but are at least as
intrinsic to the countries being.
Everyone goes on about how
laid back the D u t c h are
(famously in Amsterdam) but
many ignore the fact that this
comes from an innate love of
authority, or at least a strong
conservative respect for order in
society. Trains run on time,
people board them on time.
Service i n shops is practical,
never effuse. Dress is
straightforward (though clubs
seem the usual dressed down
palaces). Marijuana is smoked in
the red light district but nobody
drinks rowdily on the streets. A
kingdom of sensiblism.
I pondered this as I listened
to the canal boat captain. "Half of
Holland lies two to three metres
under water..." This betrays what
I think is one of the fundamental
truths about the country. A n y
nation sitting continually at the
point being the toddlers end of
the North Sea swimming pool is
bound to have an in-built desire
to preserve those mechanisms
w h i c h keep back the sea. N o
government, no dry land. After
this, the government probably
doesn't need to justify itself
much more. Therefore there isn't
the 'wouldn't we better off
without them?' questions asked
of politicians, thus they don't act
unreasonably seeking attention
and sensibleness is preserved.
A l l of w h i c h makes D a m
Square at twelve am New Years
Day an interesting anomaly.
Maybe like the ancient Romans
the natives of H o l l a n d
understand that a civilised
society must occasionally let it's
hair down. Maybe everyone was
foreign. Or maybe it was their
ready availability that resulted in
more fireworks flying around
then the latest Die Hard movie.
People were hit, hair caught fire,
someone was standing on a car
heaped i n ash on one corner
whilst another group amongst
the thousands broke up chairs
and made a huge bonfire. The
police were absent and
sensibleness was clearly taking a
night off.
