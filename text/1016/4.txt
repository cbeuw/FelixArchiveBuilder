Network
Dear Owain
A student visited the Union asking
about the Lesbian/Gay Network.
The Lesbian gay network was
started last year by two lecturers to
provide a support network for
students. Unfortunately the lectu-
rers left so the network stopped.
A student has now approached
me to say that he is prepared to
run this network. So if you are a
Lesbian or Gay student and would
like to get in touch with other
G.L.B. students there is a pigeon
hole in the Union Office or you can
contact me and I will pass your
name on. Similarly if you want to
help with the network use these
methods of contact. All help will
be appreciated.
Imperial can be a difficult place
to be a Gay or Lesbian student so if
you would prefer it the University of
London Union in (Mallet street) has
an extremely well established
group which meet on Thursdays at
7.30pm in room 2D/E.
Everyone, what ever their sexual
orientation, is at risk from Aids and
other sexually transmitted diseases
if they do not follow the "Safe Sex"
guide lines. You are at risk not
only from Aids (For which there is
as yet no known cure) but also
from Hepatitis B. The College
Health centre will immunise
students who are thought to be in
high risk groups
It is also worth noting that there
are a number of Gay and Lesbian
phone lines in London.
Lesbian and Gay Switchboard

Lesbian Line (077 257 697 7)

Thank You's
Dear Felix,
On behalf of ICU Third World First I
would like to thank everyone who
helped with the Latin American
Party Night at the end of last term
and also all those who attended. It
was a great night and we raised
about Â£400 for two projects that
are helping to protect the Brazilian
E H F E L I X l 3 J f l l ) 9 5
Rainforest. The projects supported
were a joint Oxfam TWF
sponsorship of the Brazilian Rubber
Tappers Union education
programme, and a Rainforest
Foundation (one of this years rag
charities) project to help the
indigenous tribes of the rainforest.
If anyone wants details of how the
money will be spent or how the
charities work, please contact us
through the Union pigeon holes.
Thanks again,
Jacob Tompkins, TWF.
More Thanks
Dear Felix,
The Welfare Week was designed to
raise awareness of essential issues
such as health matters and to stress
that there are people in the Union
and college who can be contacted
to discuss any problems in
confidence. The week incorporated
some important dates including
World Aids Day on December 1 st
and European Disabled Peoples
Day on December 3rd. We also
included the Drug Prevention Week
which was from the week
beginning the 75th October.
Events during the week included
a display in the Union bookstore,
information stalls in the Union and
Sherfield building, a benefit disco,
free information folders and the
opportunity to meet members of
the welfare team and watch videos
on alcohol abuse over a free lunch.
There was also a Latin American
Night organised by Third World
First. Not only was it one of the
liveliest events of the year but it
also raised a lot of money for
OXFAM.
The weeks events were
organised by the Union's Welfare
Committee and supported by
college staff including the
Disabilities Officer, Nursery staff
and College Tutors.
Other organisation also took
part in the weeks activities. Groups
such as the Hungerford Drug
Project, Chelsea and Westminister
Health Project, Brook Advisory
Centre, the Maz Project and AIDS
projects all had stalls in the Union
and the Sherfield building.
Folders containing condoms,
red ribbons and many useful
information sheets were distributed
throughout the week at the
Kensington site, St Marys and
Silwood.
Again, a BIG THANK-YOU to
everyone who made the campaign
week such a success.

Union Adviser
Bar Law
Dear Owain,
Last term I was asked to go into an
informal meeting with Terry Briley,
Deputy Head of Security and a
representative from the local
police.
At this meeting concern was
expressed about the number of
drink related incidents that have
happened [recently].
The Union has to do everything
in its power to ensure that
problems do not occur either within
its premises or outside, as a result
of people drinking in Da Vinchies
or the Traditional bar. Failure to do
this could result in the loss of our
license and possible court
proceedings.
We need to inform everyone of
possible problems and have your
support in ensuring that the licen-
sing laws are strictly adhered to.
The Licensees or their
representatives on duty must:
1. Refuse to serve anyone who,
in their opinion, appears to be
drunk. If, on any occasion, we
have to take this decision we need
your support. Friends must not then
buy drinks for the individual
concerned. This action would
compromise them and risk the bar
losing its license. The most useful
action would be for friends to rally
around and see the person safely
home.
2. Refuse entrance to anyone
who, in their opinion, is already
drunk. The Union is granted
extensions for 'Special Occasions'
but if people arrive having
obviously spent the entire evening
drinking elsewhere and in an
apparently inebriated state, then
the Stewards will have to refuse
them entry. They would not be
served at the bar anyway.
3. Ensure that all alcohol is
consumed within 20 minutes if
bar closing. This ruling applies to
all areas including the
Entertainments Lounge. Please help
our Bar Staff and Stewards by
drinking up quickly. There can be
no argument on this. If people do
not drink up in the specified time
then we have the legal obligation
to take the drinks away.
The Union has a good
reputation with the local police and
this needs to be maintained. The
Union Building is the busiest social
space with the College campus and
WE COLLECTIVELY, need to ensure
that reasonable behaviour and
adherence to the licensing laws are
our prime considerations at all
times.
A UNION BUILDING WITHOUT
A BAR IS NOT A PRETTY
THOUGHT!
Yours Sincerely,
Lucy Chothia
ICU President

If you have any items for discussion they must be given to the Union
seven college days before the meeting. Seven is the minimum possible.
No items of business will be accepted after that. I would be grateful if
you could give more than seven days notice.
