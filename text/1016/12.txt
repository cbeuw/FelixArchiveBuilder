Welcome to 1995, hereby
designated as the year of the
party. From the Romans to the
present day all the best studies
show us that regular relaxation is
the key to maximising work effic-
iency so party your way to success.
Starsky & Hutch are currently
expanding and join Alan and his
Goodfoot crew at the Wag each
Saturday from this month o n ,
ensuring a quality funky vibe
upstairs as the ideal complement
to the swing beats below. The
place rammed last weekend with
the least pretentious crowd around
& the beats were pumping. Old
school swing interspersed with
classic Hip Hop & even the
occasional taste of the 'junglist
massive', which maybe an unusual
style but it kept the whole place
jumping. Loved it.
New Year's Eve at Funkin'
Pussy also bought at the KAT club
to my ears for (ashamedly) the first
time. The feel here was elegantly
summarised as "rather more
choice FM than kiss FM" -thanks
Jeff!- ie, funk with a slightly
soulful style. Only the quality
reaches these decks lined up with
style by Keevan B, Ronnie Herrel &
Wilber Wilberforce and friends.
Definitely worth a visit.

Irony is a word not unfamiliar to the
senseless things. Take that name
for instance. Just an impetuous and
yes, ironic choice that has
inexplicably led to them being
dismissed as a gig-a-lot, teenage,
T-shirt band. And then there's the
popular music press falling all over
itself to laud punk as a musical
saviour resurrected when in reality it
never died, when the likes of the
senseless things were using it in
creating their unique sound years
ago, when they were writing about
issues long before it became 'right-
on' to do so, when of course it was
untrendy to do so.
But this is not a band to sit
back in protest and live at the
Camberley Agincourt they are
heaven bound on giving the
sizeable, if somewhat reticent, crowd
a Christmas party to remember
(hangover included). 'Touch me on
the heath' is the perfect opener -
five minutes of soaring guitars and
rasping vocals which moves from
mid-paced canter to a blazing,

Fiona officially enters 1995 -"the one I which I left ic"- and
celebrates at Goodfoot and the Kat club.
A new year? 'A whole new can of live worms' reply the music
team. Vi'k returns to his first love, watching the senseless
things and tintin rues those cipher boogie masters, zz top.
Arran Frood goes down the pub and enters the play world of
raising fire. It's warm and inviting he says ...
1,2 ... Freddy's coming for you - tintin ducks Wes Craven's
New Nightmare before hitching a lift with even cowgirl's

Hartley's amateur.
the senseless things
extra stubbly perceptions
roaring finish. And pretty much
everything from then on is perfect
too. There's the soothing of 'role
models', the thrashing of 'just one
reason', the breakneck, amphe-
tamine pop of 'ponyboy' (which
singer Mark Keds wryly introduces
as being "for any punks amongst
you") and the schizoid trip through
calm and madness that is 'keep-
sake'. And their set would not be
complete without the now
traditional closer, 'homophobic
asshole' - a violent invective where
everything that makes this band so
great fuses together into an all-out,
hardcore feast.
Yes, the senseless things are an
experience to behold both on stage
and on record. And if you need any
further convincing of their worth
then ponder on the fact that they
encored with their new single which
they've called 'something to miss'.
Now that really is ironic ...
... a fact that would have been
lost on zz top at Wembley Arena. In
a way it's surprising as they're the
band who have seemingly made a
career purely out of having two
members with beards longer than
an Edward Lear's creation whilst
simultaneously having a drummer
called Frank Beard who is singularly
unendowed.
And much of the zz top image
is on the same level of just being. I
mean this is band who arrive in
near spinal tap style onto a stage
shaped like a car's dashboard and
just are zz top. They don't have to
play anything to get there, they just
have to be - conceptual figures
fitted out in shades, stetsons and
long ( and for all we know stick on )
beards.

Raising fires is staged at the back
of a pub, the Bush, and it's a nice
one at that. In such a relaxed,
unpretentious atmosphere I'm
constantly reminded that I'm
sitting watching a play, some
fictional events from 1603.
The six main characters have
a roughly equal standing so they
receive equal thought and
attention. The tale begins as an
arsonist's whodunnit. Blaze after
blaze destroys the town and the
townsfolk's tolerance. If the main
characters combined their efforts
the arsonist could quickly be
found, but they work for their own
interests, clouded by jealously,
bigotry and prejudice.
The play exerts crisp control
over the senses: the lighting for
the first scene is of perfect
delicacy; the blood red fire is
delivered with sweet subtlety. The
actors demonstrated tension and
fear movingly. Paul Ritter's
performance as a disturbed village
criminal was the most potent, his
sincere line "I was born a
murderer" got the biggest laugh.
Perhaps humour wasn't employed
at many opportunities where it
could have been. If it had the play
would have been more of a black
comedy but I feel that comic
potential wasn't wasted, it just put
to one side.
I can't complain really,
mesmerised by the second act I
didn't even finish my interval

Still some sort of performance
is offered up. These guys haven't
got this big without pleasing the
crowd and it doesn't take too long
before the last top trump, after
beards and cars, is unveiled.
Writhing, sinuous female silhouettes
are projected up to general laddish
approval. Billy and Dusty continue
wandering around with their
churning boogie riffs but the tone of
the evening has been set. At three
songs intervals on prance the six
lovelies in various stages of
misdress. The crowd love it and to
be honest there's not much else to
get excited about.
The gulf between older songs
like 'jesus just left Chicago' or 'I'm
bad, I'm nationwide' and the
current cover-single, 'viva las vegas'
is not just one of authorship but
rather underlines a deeper issue, zz
top are dangerously close to
becoming a kind of postmodern
phenomenon - rock icons without
meaning or tunes, just a old set of
greying whiskers. 0
