ICSC in the Castaways Cup
A perfect day for the
intercollegiate championship,
plus the last chance to sail at
Welsh Help until maybe the next
academic year.
Imperial was strongly
represented in the form of two
teams against U C L , Royal Vets
College and George's & Thomas.
Imperial 1s t
won every race in
the league while the 2 n d
were
getting good practice.
The three race final came
down to Imperial 1 s t
and U C L
1s t
. The first race was clearly won
by Imperial, but the second and
third races were lost due to
school-boy errors. Luckily
Imperial had a protest on the
second race which their team
captain duly won. So on the day
the best team won.
Congratulations to the
Imperial lads of Andy Jones,
James 'FLEES' Lees, Nick
Cameron and T i m Bastow.
Thanks must go out to Simon
Spalton for helping and
sponsoring the competition and
Rory for his help. Thanks also go
to Tash, Jilly, Dan and Andy for
a storming Christmas meal
afterwards. Hopefully we'll find a
place to sail next term.

IC Ladies vs Saints
A n excessive amount of Christmas
pudding did nothing to slow
down a storming performance
against our old rivals from
Perivale.
Convincing from the start,
control was taken early on. Some
games were tight but when it
came to the crunch, the team
spirit kept our heads held high
and we pulled through.
Special well done to Elaine
(resident friendship bracelet
knitter), Dani (taxi driver) and
Carolyn (old, but dead good).
We're halfway through the season
and up at the top of the table.

happy new year to you all. I hope
that overindulgence in festive
foodstuffs has not impaired your
fitness, so that you may play for
the teams and give us lots of
reports.
I also hope that your new year's
resolutions included always
writing the name of your sport on
your reports, to make our lives
easier and to avoid mistakes.
Lastly, thanks very much for all
