Having little with which to occupy
the wand'rings of my mind at this
stage, I, your good and trusted
Frater, thought it appropriate to
mention how it became seeded; for
in this day of wondrous devices and
invisible communication, the most
true source of information is oft
P O L I T I C A L S C I E N C E
Eric Ash, lately rector of Imperial,
now heads the Student Loans
Company. Whether he will actually
make any strategic difference to
the issue of undergraduate finance
may, however, be doubtful.
The SLC has made a
complete mess of this academic
year. Its last chief executive
resigned due to ill health at the
end of last year, when reportedly
thousands of students had had
their applications lost in the
system. In some ways the SLC's
situation is not very different from
the CSA's. Both were formed to
shift the source of finance of what
used to be publicly-funded goods.
Both have been unable to cope for
reasons that arise from the
government's inability to tackle a
policy issue head on.
There is a need for reform
because the picture of
undergraduate finance is very
different from reality. It appears as
though the governmet funds
undergraduate education. It
doesn't. Grants are not universal;
they arrive late; and they rarely
forgot. Yea, those texts, those
crusted and crumbling words which
fall to one's eyes, cannot be
appreciated from without the bleak
gaze of a computer screen but
must be gleaned from that most
ancient and yet modern device, the
book. I dream of my wish that
books may remain as they are for
ever more, for there is something
so beautiful and touching about
this archaic manner of passing
information from one to another.
Books also lend themselves
so easily to places of beauty; the
corner of the park or the rattling
seat of the underground in which
one reads them, and of course the
comforting surrounds of the shop in
which they are procured. There is
no more inspiring such place than
cover the rent. But it is a pragmatic
idea not to raid the public purse for
money. Consider it this way: is it
the government's job to subsidise
expensive training for a minority?
Training that will be of benefit first
to the recipient? More importantly,
do students want to be treated as
those relying solely on the State?
Science students can, in particular,
stand on their own two feet better
than others. (The last is a hunch I
have, but am not aware of any
numbers to back it up with.)
"Is it the government's
job to subsidise training
for a minority? "
The main political parties
seem to be of the view that grants
are not the way to go: The Tories
with their attempts to shift the
burden of financing to the student
himself; And Labour now taking
the view that further education
should be funded via some kind of
Graduate Tax, to be administered
perhaps through the National
Insurance system. But it remains to
be seen whether either will actually
plunge head first into such
reforms. Both will be scared of
losing votes from the middle-class
("it's our right to be educated")
and the lower-class ("loans will
deter the poor student"). Political
parties never have the guts for this
kind of fight.
So, Mr Ash's job, it seems,
will largely consist of day to day
operational matters at the SLC.
More the pity.

Atlantis Books, hidden down an
alley near the halls of the British
Museum. This veritable treasure
house of arcana and obscure
history has built up a patina of
mysticism that truly reflects the
nature of the texts within. Haunting
this place are those who can claim
to be witches, or mages of the
modern age. Skulking in a corner
you may find your Frater, unusually
timid in such an holy place.
A book can also bestow its
beauty onto the region in which it
is perused. Upon opening his tome,
the reader becomes transformed
from a lonely soul to a sculpture
which remains in eternal reference
to its surrounds, the absorption of
his mind creating a timely
juxtaposition with the endless flux
of activity around him. It is a
moment without the universe. I
could never hope to live without
such moments, and thus I would
mourn endlessly the passing of
these times, if I were to find myself
unable to slip into a pocket a wad
of printed words. The Web may be
democratic, it may have everything,
but it will never match the
revelatory discoveries that abound
in a book.
