SQUASH
The 1st axe a p o t e n t i a l l y strong
squash f i v e , when they a l l play. Also
the 2nd half of the ladder lias now pro-
duced some useful squash players, and
the prospects for the future are good.
The l 3 t recorded a very good 3-2 win
over St. Mary's Hospital some time ago.
On t h e i r day they can f i e l d a very strong
team so i t w i l i be a match worth watching
when they play here. Mike Usher f i r s t
upset t h e i r plans with a 3-2 win, and then
Skip and Sec have comfortable wins. John
v.il3on founa i t not a l l l i k e tennis, but
did extremely w e l l considering his i d l e -
ness.
we also had a close match with Univ-
e r s i t y College Hospital, winning again
by the 3ame margin, tne match being notab]
f o r the high standard of squash played by
lower strings, Robin Jowit's match being
well worth watching.
The team was well beaten 8-5 by
Queen's up at Oxford, but has since
claimed.with some j u s t i f i c a t i o n that i t
was nobbled very successfully at lunch.
Food i n S.W.7. might be , but you
should t r y toad-in-the ... a l a Queen's
and then a l i t t l e squash to s e t t l e i t
down. Sec missed the lunch and had a
very good game, (which he should have
won). After 1 j hours of squash he sur-
rendered.
Our "A" team was again too good f o r
S.O.A.S.,but had a close game with the
I n s t i t u t e of Advanced Education which
we won 3-2. Their No. 1 was absent (at
the Middlesex open) so someone i s going
to do some running on the return.
Westminster Hospital were beaten 5-0
t h i s year, but they are unfortunate i n
only having f i v e players.
Our 2nd V has overpowered many a b i g
f i s h t h i s season. Their l a t e s t bag was
a 5-0 win over Royal Vets. They also
accompanied the 1st team to Cardiff where
I.C. recorded a 10-0 win, that no mean
achievement a f t e r 150 miles t r a v e l l i n g
i n a t i n trunk. The t r i p was made worth
while by two things: the No. 1 match,
Brian Avient, on home ground, recording
a t h r i l l i n g 3-2 win having lost the f i r s t
two; and our v i s i t to Hallingham'a bar,
which was an occasion of a l i f e t i m e .
Choristers of I.C.'s bar should only be
licensed to aing having spent a oaturday
evening d r i n k i n g i n C a r d i f f .
The Club evenings have certainly proved
successful and i t i s very encouraging to
see people improving so quickly under the
eye of the short-tempered professionals.
There i a also some very good squash being
played at I.C. This i s well worth watch-
ing i f you are learning or keen to improve.
Last Saturday was an example when Sidney
Sussex, Cam., v i s i t e d us. The gallery
saw one of the fastest games of the
season when Ron Crea3y at No. 1 beat Hugh
l a t t e r s o n , 3-2. Skip 3rian hayward also
haa a f i n e game using his newly acquired
"drop", beating Roger Irideaux, Cambridge
c r i c k e t blue, 3-2. He eventually won the
match 4-1•
tie have seen the introduction of
doubles on Monday n i hts too, This
i s a very enjoyable game i f i t i s not
played seriously; not played f o r too
long; and i f players make every e f f o r t
not to swing their racquets into each
other's faces. You know what I mean!
Notices are now up about the
Whitely Cup. This i s I.C.'s closed singles
competition. Entrances close on Monday,
Nov. 30th at 5.15 p.m., the time of the
Squash Club's Winter General Meeting.

BADMINTON
Since the l a s t report the club
baa recorded a series of v i c t o r i e s ,
the most noteworthy of which was the
f i n e 7-2 defeat of Reading University
by the f i r s t 6 on our own courts.This
we hope w i l l be a good omen f o r the
d i f f i c u l t matches next term against
Oxford Woodpeckers and Cambridge Cook-
s r e .
The mixed team played against
L.S.E. recently and a f t e r a c l o s e
match, won by 5 rubbers to 4. this
r e s u l t was a l i t t l e unexpected because
one of the o r i g i n a l team beoane
indisposed and her replacement had
never before played badminton. We
wonder i f the a t h l e t i c prowess of
Saty's Greek ancestor* had anything t o

ATHLETICS
Under good running conditions
on Sunday Nov. 22nd, seven teams took
part i n a "Two man ten mile relay'
held at Hurlinghaa Two teams were
not able to complete the course, but of
those who d i d the winning p a i r was Dave
Briggs (ex-I.C.) and John'Collins (pres-
ent I.C.). Their time of 44 minutes
53.2 seconds, I am told, ranks them
among the "top dozen" best performances
f o r 1959. (The best performance
f o r 1959 of 43 a. 43.2 sees, was set by
Bruce Tulloh and Martin Hyman, both
Internationals). Dave's and John's
performance i s a very commendable one
The second team (Robertaon and
W i l l o t of Royal TEets) f i n i s h e d i n

team (A. Brown and D. Hammonds) i n
