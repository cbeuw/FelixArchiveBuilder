WEEKS HALL
Well and Truly
WARMED
F r i d a y night iiav. 20th saw the
long awaited Weeks H a l l warming, party.
It was an unqualified success and one
wonders i f the l a s t guest has l e f t yet.
In f a c t there may s t i l l be someone trap-
ped i n the l i f t which showed i t s usual
form by breaking down s h o r t l y a f t e r the
party s t a r t e d .
The I.C. Jazz Band played to
just over 300 enthusiastic guests u n t i l
midnight, when the party then dispersed
throughout the b u i l d i n g . An excellent
buffet supper was arranged on 4 f l o o r s
and the impromptu bar, set up on the
ground f l o o r , d i d good trade.
At 2 a.m. a Jazz t r i o a r r i v e d
and announced they had been invited t o
play. The organisers knew nothing of
t h i s but consented to l e t them supple-
ment the gramaphones on whatever f l o o r
they wished. . However at 5 a.m. these
gentlemen were found asleep in'the
lounge and were f i r m l y t o l d they would
have to go.
Weeks H a l l has now returned t o
some semblance of order,the decorations
have been taken down, the smell of
cigarette smoke and beer has been r e -
placed by burning toast and f l o o r p o l i s h .
However the b u i l d i n g now f e e l s l e s s of
a greenhouse and more of a h o s t e l .
Yes Weeks H a l l has been w e l l and t r u l y
warmed.

A certain young gentleman w h i l s t

weeks has noticed the c a t - c a l l s ,

"But I don't know my way around the

(Ha-ha)
We have i t on the best possible
authority that the report i n the
D T of the I.C. v Kings
Rugby Cup Match was not written by
Mr. Bregazzi's brother ( I t was his uncle).
The President of one of the r e l i g i o u s
s o c i e t i e s of I.C. was heard to remark the
other day "1 went to Chiswick expecting
to f i n d Anne i n bed. I was disappointed."
In which p a r t i c u l a r way he d i d not say.
A few days ago one of the top Judonen
of I.C. was involved i n a f i g h t with a
car and i t was neoessary f o r him to spend
two days i n hospital. Vihen our reporter
asked-him about i t , the only remark made
by t h i s gentleman was "Tha shuda ain't
car."

U N I O N M E E T I N G
The R.C.S. Union in a mood of
euphrasia elected the gracious f a i r -
haired K i s s Beverley Bradford as Queen
of Jezebel at a crowded General Meeting
on the twelfth of November. The
election was to be decided by the volume
of applause. A noise meter was used
to determine t h i s , though the number of
decibells obtained by each candidate was
not announced, b'our b e a u t i f u l young
ladies were contending f o r the crown of
R.C.S. and were received with thunderous
cheers as they displayed t h e i r charms
on the demonstration bench provided by
the Mathematics department. (Two
gentlemen were also greeted by loud
cheers and stamping, but refused on
grounds of incompetence to enter the
competition). The cheers f o r Miss
Bradford were, however, s l i g h t l y the
loudest.. A second experiment gave an
i d e n t i c a l result and Miss Bradford was
crowned Queen of Jezebel. I t was
noticeable that a v i s i t i n g Guildsman,
Mr. kike 3arron, made most noise of a l l
i n support of iiiss Bradford. The
blushing Beverley, as has been the
custom, declined to say a few words.
An uproarious vote of thanks was given
to the r e t i r i n g Queen Xandra, who was
presented with a bonnet i n R.C.S.
colours.
E a r l i e r the Union had listened
enthralled to lir. L;cKarnus, the red-
headed and uninjured Trophy Officer,
gave a highly coloured account of the
events of Morphy week, including an
especially elaborate description of the
b a t t l e of the tyre, which he said the
mighty warriors of R.C.S. would doubt-
less have won had not the puny Guildsmen
succeeded i n taking off t h e i r shoes.
Following this K i s s iompsett
presented the liorphy Qup to Lave Keeley
and the accompanying pots t o the winning
crew. Elections were held f o r various
representatives on the R.C.^>. General
Committee and reports read by the secre-
tary on the Freshersh Dinners and by
Mr. Bernard Liengme oh the proceedings
of I.C. Union Council.
The achievement of the Guilds
President, Mr. Nove, i n catching a f i s h
was sportingly aclaimed, Mr. F o r s t e r
apologised f o r not having the f i s h to
show to the Union but explained that,
although j a - i g i n a l l y an appreciable f i s h
i t had now considerably depreciated.
Mr. Bernard Leingme r a i s e d the
question of the I.C. Carnival. Vrho
should get the proceeds? The decision,
he said, seemed t o l i e between W.U.S;
and St. Georges Hospital. On a show
of hand3 i t was decided to give a l l the
proceeds to W.U.S. Mr. Forster then
mentioned that the Viorld Refugee Year
was an a l t e r n a t i v e that had been mooted.
Miss G i l l i a n Fryd obviously an
enthusiast, pointed out that the W.R.Y.
campaign was already a c t i v e i n this
area, and the Carnival whose proceeds
would be devoted to i t would prove most
popular with the inhabitants of Kensing-
ton. And an amazing thing occurred.
The Union threw i t s previous decision
over-board and voted nem.com. i n favour
of W.R.Y. As mentioned elsewhere t h i s
decision has sinoe been overwhelmingly
confirmed by the I.C. Union.
An I.C. Carnival (R.C.S.) committee
i s now being formed and things w i l l
3hortly be getting under way.
