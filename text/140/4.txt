The small attendance of spectators
at recent sports matches (the Rugby Cup
game against Aings was a notable
exception), s o c i a l events, and the
various Union meetings, i s one more
indication of the lack of interest and
support by the greater proportion of the
members of this College i n a c t i v i t i e s
which do not immediately and d i r e c t l y
benefit them.
On a r r i v a l at I.C. we were a l l
subjected to c a j o l i n g , pleadings, and
perorations from a l l quarters not to be
'brown-baggers' and slaves to work, but
to enter i n t o the sports and s o c i a l l i f e
of the oollege and to make I.C. the f o r -
most college i n the University. These
attacks have been repeated at intervals
with decreasing intensity.
The point has been reached when I.
C. should withdraw i t s head from the
sand and wipe the sand froi.; i t s eyes.
?or too long energies have been mis-
directed i n trying to make I.C. a
college of the University, misdirected
because the University does riot exist,
but only the 'Technical I n s t i t u t e s of
London". At no time has the main body
of students persued i t s course i n the
search of knowledge or of d i s i n t e r e s t e d
learning. The Colleges of London have
merely been us>--d to provide students
with the right l e t t e r s a f t e r t h e i r names
in order to earn l a r g e r salaries.
The aim of a u n i v e r s i t y should be
to allow the culture i n s t i l l e d i n early
l i f e to bear f r u i t . In t h i s London
f a i l s miserably. I t produces very few
who are educated and no technicians, or
more grandiloquently, technologists, but
thousands of i n t o l e r a n t , half-baked
creatures f i t f o r very l i t t l e at a l l .
That some emerge from this chaos v i c t o r -
ious, i s a blessing f o r which we should
a l l be thankful.
A l l that a u n i v e r s i t y can do i s to
encourage development. i?or the most
part the people, you and I, that come to
this College are ignorant of much that
i s good and b e a u t i f u l i n thi3 world, the
Humanities and the Arts. hue to our
early backgrounds the seed of culture i s
not within us and no amount of day
dreaming or wis'nful thinking can cover
up our appalling ignorance.
The argument that the Arts have the
same problems i s a v a l i d one, although
they are versed i n e i t h e r the h i s t o r i e s
of the V.orld, or the development of Art,
they are often completely unaware of
other form3 of expression or of the
Sciences.
K i n a l l y , one more depressing
thought comes to mind. 'v
e are a l l so
engrossed i n furthering our own i n d i -
vidual aims, that no amount of r e f o r -
mation of outlook by the more broad min-
dea, w i l l a l t e r the fact that as
products of a technical decree faotory
we w i l l give nothing to s o c i a l l i f e .

Dear S i r ,
I f e e l obliged to protest
strongly against the p u b l i c a t i o n and
s e l l i n g at I.C. of "The Voice of the
Huxley Society," namely Scrutiny. The
a r t i c l e which offends most i s , of
course, the one on the L i f e of C h r i s t .
When prejudice, blasphemy, and unhis-
t a r i c a l c r i t i c i s m are camouflaged by
a l a b e l saying " o r i g i n a l research,"
then I think that publishing should
cease. As a "bigoted Christian," I
would direct the attention of the author
(cautiously anonymousl) t o the other
99? of the research on C h r i s t whioh
does not support his w i l d theories.
Tours dogmatically,
Alan F. G. Lewis.
Dear S i r ,
Your account of Morphy Day ....
"Essentially the o f f i c i a l I.C. Rag
Day" i s an admirable summary of
events. However, i n cutting out
superfluous information you also
omitted to mention that two races bet-
ween the Constituent Colleges took
place upon the water. May I take t h i s
opportunity of informing you that R.C.S.
won the Morphy by a comfortable 2 j
lengths, while Guilds took the Lowry
by a canvas, a f t e r a neck and neck
struggle?
I t seems a sad r e i l e c t i a n on the
attitude of the College t o sport (of
an a t h l e t i c nature!) that the
behaviour of the (supporters?) i s
considered of such importance as t o
crowd out a l l information on the
match i t s e l f .
Yours, etc.,
"Rowing Type"
Dear Sir,
We should like to apologise to Mr.
Smalley, A.R.C.S. far our error as to the
dates of the reign of Edward VU1; this
however was due to a slip of the tongue
rather than to the "narrowness of an
Imperial College education".
We are, however, appalled that Mr.
Smalley, even with the letters A.R.C.5.
after'his name, should think that
education in any way devolves upon
historical dates. It is surely far more
important to be able to write gramma*
tioally correct English and so avoid the
five foolish blunders which Mr. Smalley
made in his letter.
We feel, therefore, that before Mr.
Smalley presumes to criticise minor
errors in others, he should look mare
closely to his own shortcomings.
Further, wo should respectfully like
to remind Mr. Smalley that what we do
with the 'six pound prise' is entirely
our own oonoern.
Yours faithfully,
Ian W. H i l l
Charles A. Mathews.
Dear S i r ,
Referring to Mr. 3rett's l e t t e r
i n the l a s t issue I do consider that most
members of the Union would agree that an
excess of hooliganism, devoid of any
humour or subtlety, at College Dinners
is_ not to be desired. This applies
especially to the Freshers' Dinners when'
the f i r s t impressions a Fresher gains
of the Union s o c i a l l i f e are most
important and not e a s i l y erased.
However, just as manners, and
clothes,. maketh man, I would beg to
suggest that i t i s the gentleman attend-
ing and not the alcoholic content or
vintage of t h e i r beverage that essen-
t i a l l y contributes towards the sucoess
of a dinner.
I f , therefore, one attempt i s to
be made to make the Freshers' Dinners
a l i t t l e more formal and to persuade
the gentlemen to give way to t h e i r
exuberance i n the more f i t t i n g
surroundings of the Bar then the 2nd and
3rd year students must be f i r s t induced
to set an example. This can be done
over a period of 2 to 3 years by f i r s t
introducing table wines i n l i e u of beer
at the Annual Dinners of the various
departmental s o o i t i e s , as i s done a l -
ready i n several oases.
One must not, nevertheless,
theorise to too great an extent f o r one
must not forget that undergraduates
(and indeed postgraduates) w i l l always
tend to l e t off a l i t t l e steam at
Dinners, and that t h e i r bank balances
are not always capable of withstanding
the increased costs incurred by a
preference towards a good table wine.
Yours f a i t h f u l l y ,
R.H.T. Garnett
Dear S i r ,
I am asked by the agents i n question,
to make i t c l e a r to your readers that
that the Dramatic Society had not
received permission to perform "Lizard on
the Rock" at the time that i t s advertise-
ment i n the l a s t issue of F e l i x went to
press.
I t was refused permission soon a f t e r
t h i s by the author's agents, on the
grounds that a professional presentation
has been arranged f o r sometime i n 1960
The Sooiety regrets that i t cannot
do t h i s play and w i l l do instead "Without
The Prince" by P h i l i p Xing.
Yours f a i t h f u l l y ,
M.L, Combridge.
