I WAS A
W O M A N
AT I.C.
( a l t e r n a t i v e t i t l e : Reflections on
being a woman at I.C.)
"Imperial Collegel-you must be
b r i g h t to have gained a place there!*
Imperial College?. . that i s S. Ken
i s n ' t i t ? . . . "Imperial College-
but
that i s a man's college*" A f t e r such
remarks i t i s no wonder that I was
a l i t t l e apprehensive when I oame to
the Freshers Day receptions,
'iVe few new g i r l s occupied two
rows i n the packed h a l l , the rest
were men and they a l l eyed us c u r i -
ously. A f t e r being t o l d to work hard,
by the Hector ,.and piny hard, by the
President we were l e f t to the mercy
of the eighty odd cluus and societies
a l l . eager to r e c r u i t new members.
"We have never had a woman i n the
club, j o i n us!" " J o i n the ....
sooiety!" J o i n t h i s club, that society
....Where d i d my chosen subject, maths,
oome into i t ?
"Come and have tea i n the I.C.W.A.
Lounge," these were the most welcome
words I had heard that afternoon, but
t h i s wierd word 'I.C.W.A.* had to be
explained to me.
Vhat was i t l i k e to be a g i r l
among so many men? (when I oame there
was one g i r l f o r every f i f t y men,now
there i s one g i r l f o r every twenty
f i v e ) I t was a b i t disconcerting at
f i r s t . Going into the refectory was
a frightening experience, I used to
shake i n my 3hoes. One day a b i g
brute of a man, who should have knuwn
better, turned to me and said : "Hallo
l i t t l e g i r l i e , and what i s your name?"
Despite t h i s and other setbacks, I soon
• found myself making friends among the
members of the clubs I had j.ined so
that I could recofTiise friends as I
went i n t o the refectory and soon
forgot to be frightened.
When I started at College I was
t o l d about the Vacations Works Scheme.
As I had no idea what career I might
take up i f and when I got a degree,
i t seemed, and i s S t i l l , a good idea
to j o i n the scheme. I was lucky enough
t o go to Switzerland f o r ten weeks
through the I.A.E.S.T.B. organisation.
I t i s a strange fact that few
members of I.C.W.A. go to the Saturday
Hops regularly. I went to about four i n
a l l , but'at each one I met I.C. men who
did not know I was at I.C. myself, and
who were t o t a l l y ignorant of I.C.W.A.
Sure they knew I.C.W.A existed; but how
many women there were i n oollege or
that we have a president and secretary
- they just had no idea of i t ! I f ever
I wanted to f i n d out how important
I.C.«.A. waa to the average i.C. man
I would go to a hop!
When I l e f t I.C. I had changed a
great deal from the shy and unaertain
s c h o o l g i r l who thought that to get a de-
roe was the ultimate aim of her l i f e .
Now I know that a B.Sc. i s not the pass-
port I had thou^it but merely a stepping
stone, and the more I t r y to learn, the
more there i s to learn. Most of a l l I
learned that i n order to learn from
College Union l i f e , one must be prepared
to work f o r the Union. I t d i d not take
me long t o r e a l i s e that although tha
clubs advertised for new r e c r u i t s on
Fresher's Day I could not become a
member of any one of them unless I made
an effort to show that I was interested.
I t would have been easy to become "a
brown-bagger" or anyway "10-5 e , but,
l i k e most people, I was quick to see '
that lectures were only h a l f of
University l i f e , and I had to make the
move to make the other h a l f effective.

A P A R T H E I D
We are frequently told that we l i v e
i n an enlightened age; an age when a l l
men are considered equal; an age when a l l
men share the same rights' irrespective of
raoe, creed or colour and a man i s not to
be persecuted merely because of the c o l -
our of h i s skin. We are frequently t o l d
t h i s , and i n general i t i s true, but i t
would not be true i f we- l i v e d i n South
A f r i c a .
Ever since the National Party oame w>
power i n the Union of South A f r i c a the
ten m i l l i o n coloured people there have
fought a losing battle against a p o l i c y
of segregation and discrimination designed
to perpetuate, and furthermore to increase
t h e i r domination by the white minority.
They have resisted with immense courage
the slow, i n s i d i o u s erosion of t h e i r
human d i g n i t y . They have used passive
resistance methods whenever possible, and
i n 1957 they made very effective use of
the boycott against crippling f a r e i n -
creases on the (segregated) public trans-
port. Thousands of Africans walked great
distances d a i l y i n protest, and they won.
But t h i s i s only one success: the p o l i c e
state possesses crushing power, and any
campaign against i t can only succeed with
help from outside. We now have an oppor-
tunity to provide such help.
The South African government i s very
sensitive to c r i t i c i s m i n other countries.
True, there has been no lack of this i n
the past,and i t has not had a great deal
of effect, but i f i t were backed up by
p r a c t i c a l measures the story might w e l l
be very different. The coloured people
know t h i s , and they have appealed f o r
a boycott of South African exports i n
other countries. In this way they seek
to embarrass and weaken the present gov-
ernment and make way f o r more moderate
elements.
As I write t h i s , a meeting of I.C.
Union stands adjourned, with a motion
before i t on this issue. Whether the
motion i s passed or defeated, every one
of us can, without causing ourselves any
inconvenience or making any major s a c r i -
f i c e s , help these oppressed people by
refusing to buy South African goods, and
t e l l i n g people why. A l l of us at some
time or other buy South African f r u i t ,
'jams, wines, cigaiettes and other imems.
In every case, i t i s a simple matter to
give up buying the South African product
and change to another brand made else-
where. • I t i s an equally simple matter to
enquire whether non-branded goods are of
South African o r i g i n , and to t e l l the
supplier why. Any one of us oan, I admit,
make only a small contribution, but the
oombined e f f o r t s of us a l l could have a
s i g n i f i c a n t effect. I t i s surely better
f o r right-thinking people to act on their
opinions, rather than s i t back smoking
South African cigarettes and uttering
pious platitudes.

A V I D K A Z E M I
JAZZ
CLUB
About a year ago I.C Jazs Club
organized an evening jazz session f o r
the benefit of those who wanted f r e e
entertainment i n relaxed informal
surrouiidinga. This promoted quite
some interest and i t was decided that
these sessions should be made a
regular thing t h i s year.
Last Wednesday was the f i r s t of
suoh occasions, and the upper refectory
was f i l l e d with the sounds of musio,
f i l t e r e d through a mass of gyrating
bodies. As t h i s was the f i r s t session
there were many f a u l t s , p a r t i c u l a r l y
oonoerning organisation, but on the
whole the evening was a suooess- i f
only f o r the strong complaints r e -
ceived from Q.A.
I t was fortunate (?) that Dennis
Leston was secured f o r the evening.
The large fee f o r h i s h i r e was w e l l
spent,for h i s oompering proved to be
of a ver-^r high standard and he held
the show together i n a manner i n which
only he can.
A l l the regular 1.0. Jazz groups
were i n attendance, there were frequent
rushes to the bar t o fetch s t r a y
musioians. The Folk Group made i t s
debut, but did not seem p a r t i c u l a r l y
at home i n the Lestonian surroundings.
However, they show much promise i n t h i s
f i e l d and we wish them luck i n t h e i r
performances at the Troubadour Club.
titan Salmons and Richard Rush ton
provided superb piano jazz of d i f f e r i n g
s t y l e s , and the mainstream orchestra
under the leadership of J e f f Kay
( featuring the great John Farnswarth
an trombone N
Twung w e l l at times.
A rather shambolic jam session made*,
by" Dennis Lesfbn provided a l i t t l e
amusement f o r those taking part, and
the evening f i n i s h e d with a f i g h t
between Leston and a l i t t l e known
Rhythm and Blues singer as to who
should f i n a l l y send everyone with vocal
excursions.
Our next session w i l l be on Wed.
December 2nd, and meanwhile we welcome
any objective c r i t i c i s m and monetary
help.
