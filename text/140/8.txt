It i s with great r e l i e f that I oan
now report the appointaient of permanent
captains f o r s i x of the seven I.C. teams.
I t i s believed that this i s a move which
w i l l ensure that a l l players w i l l have
every op-ortunity to be jromoted or
relegated according to their a b i l i t y .
I would ask a l l of you to support your
team captain as much as possible since
he has an unenviable job to carry out
and i t can be made much easier with your
oooperation. When he t e l l s you to
"use the open space" don1
t just l i f t
your l e f t leg and imitate a French
Poodle.
As 'most of the Soccer Club (and I
hope many other people i n College as
well) already know the cup team beat
L.S.E. by one goal to n i l i n the f i r s t
round proper of the U.L. cup. L.S.E.
are (correction, were!) one of the
stronger sides i n the Cup and this
victory,close as i t was, promises
well f o r the Clubs chances i n the
competition. The match wa. very hard
fought with f i e r c e tackling on both
sides and plenty of good swinging foot-
b a l l . A highlight of the match was a
dual between the I.C. inside forwards,
Harris and Finney and the L.a.&. half-
backs, a l l of them University players.
Honours were even a f t e r 50 minutes, the
L.S.E. players having blocked the
approach down the middle but they were
not able to cut off a steady supply of
passes to the I.C. wingers who
unfortunately d i d not make the most of
t h e i r opportunities, Green the l e f t -
winger, spent some considerable time i n
oontaot with Mother Earth due to a lack
of studs i n h i s boots. The half-backs,
Dai Joyoe i n p a r t i c u l a r , played very
s o l i d l y and prevented the L.S.E.
forwards from ever getting a r e a l grip
on the game. The deciding b a l l came a
a f t e r about f i f t e e n minutes of the
second h a l f when a chain reaction of
headers from the I.C. forward.-- l e f t
Kinesman Pierre Mousset-Jones with the
oportunity t o provide the f i n a l
explosive s ark as he carried the b a l l
i n t o the L.S.E. net, on h i s chest, from
close range. With a great sigh of
r e l i e f at the f i n a l w h i s t l e , I.C. turn-
ed t h e i r minds t o l e s s stern a f f a i r s
and o b l i g i n g l y helped L.S.E. to drown
t h e i r sorrows i n the usual appropriate
manner. The next cup round i s on
December 5th when I.C. play Institute
of Education on which occasion a l l t
support w i l l be welcome.
In this conneotion the club would
l i k e to offer t h e i r congratulations to
the I.C. Rugby Club Who scored such a
noticeable victory over Kings, i n the
seoond round of the U.L. Rugby Cup,.
Also to a l i supporters who turned out
and whose vociferous cheering must have
made so much difference to the team.
Similar regards to the Hockey Club who
I am told are quite determined to win
t h e i r cups this year. I f a l l three
clubs are successful then I.C. w i l l be
assured of a t r i p l e dinner whioh w i l l
be as long remembered as the event i t
w i l l be celebrating.
Descending from the heights to the
hurly-burly of the League and f r i e n d l y
games, that s o l i d foundation, b u i l t by
l o y a l clubmen, upon which the eminences
of the Soccer Club are b u i l t , we f i n d
that the f i r s t eleven have drawn three
a l l w i t h o l d r i v a l s Kings at Lavender
Avenue and lost by a large margin of 6-1
to equally o l d r i v a l s U.C. at Stanley.
In a f r i e n d l y , St. Cleraant Dane3 forced a
draw 4-4 late i n the game a f t e r a cut
and thrust b a t t l e i n which both sides
were successively two goals i n arears.
A highly successful t r i p to Cambridge
to play Christ's»College was marred only
by l o s i n g the actual game of f o o t b a l l
5-0. This result was no doubt
influenced by a social gathering i n the
Weeks H a l l the previous evening. I.C.
were, however, highly successful against
a representative Cambridge side both at
- ,
J o t t l e ' and i n a 'boat-raoe'.
SPORT
C R O S S C O U N T R Y
On Wednesday 11th an "A" team defeated
Q.M.C. by 32 pts. to 52 on the j i t t e r

The same day the second team were
running against the College of St. Mark
and St. John over a course on Wimble-
don Common. The opposition was defeated
easily by 28 pts. to 52 due mainly to the
efforts of Hooker and Turner ( j o i n t 1st),
Clare (5), Butler (6) and Gay l a r d (10)
On Saturday, 21st Wimbledon A t h l e t i c
Club were hosts to teams from I.C. and

Met. P o l i c e (123) with Wimbledon A.C.
t h i r d at 136. I t i s of interest to note
that "Crusher" C o l l i n s i s no* faster

wish him every success i n h i s future career^
Coming f i r s t he broke the course record
and helped the Club t o victory being f o l l -
owed by Auton (5), Warren (7) and Hammonds
(8).

The club continues i t s improved
record by scoring two more wins over
the Metropolitan i o l i c e and Cambridge
University. On Tuesday a team of
Metropolitan Police was beaten by four
contests to one, with one draw.
Shepherd managed to topple his eight-
een stone opponent although there i s
s t i l l some argument as to what technique
waa used. This, however, set the pace
for most of the other contests. we
were unfortunate i n not seeing
Ramsbottom's favourate technique i n
aotion, but he scored on the ground with
a Kami-Shiho gatame.
On Saturday we beat Cambridge by
two contests to one with two draws.
A l l but one ~" the contests lasted the
f u l l time, and with two to go Cambridge
were winning by one contest. However
the l a s t two were never r e a l l y i n doubt
and I.C. gained a w e l l deserved victory.
SWIMMING
Last Wednesday and Thursday, three I.C.
teams competed i n the U.L.K.0 COMPETITION,
and i n the f i n a l I.C.II beat Battersea,
the conquerors of the f i r s t team.
On the f i r s t night I.C. suffered
several disappointments when f i r s t of
a l l Coxon dislocated his shoulder,
and with 6 men I.C. had to go t o extra
time to beat L.S.E. Then i n the next
round, although having 80? of the play,
by^atroeioua shooting, they f a i l e d t o
concede 2 goals handicap t o Battersea
and l o s t 4-2. Meanwhile the second team,
despite having t h e i r captain on the side,
fan h a l f of one matoh, had progressed

II 8-5 and Wye 7-5.
On the Thursday I.C. I I managed to
hang on t o t h e i r 4 goal handicap and beat
Bart's Hospital by 5-3. The t h i r d team,

show against Battersea but were easily beats*.
8-6. Next I.C. I I had t h e i r hardest
match so f a r when they beat Chelsea by
5-4, the teams s t a r t i n g l e v e l 4 - a l l , the
only goal of the game being scored by HART
early i n the f i r s t h a l f , and i n the second
only f i n e defensive play, and point blank
saves by CARTER enabled them t o hang an.

determination won by 3 M , the only I.C.
goal being soared by COHREGAN with

a l l of the hard won p i n of beer was
quickly consumed.
