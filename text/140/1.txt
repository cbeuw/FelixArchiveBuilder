CAPTAIN MIKE BREGAZZI
SHOWED FINE LEADERSHIP
IN BRILLIANT SECOND HALF
RECOVERY BY IC.
This year as there have not
been seedings i n the draw of the
U.L. oup, Imperial and Kings have
met early on in the competition and
not in the final as has happened on
many occasions before* In many minds,
there was the thought that the winner
of this game would definitely be at
Motspur Park on Feb. 20th. and would
probably take thr oup home with them.
The I,C. team was at f u l l strength
Vand on paper looked very impressive,
but as i t consisted of U.L. players
and 5 0 $ I.C. first team players who
jhad only played together onoe before
their real ability was unproven. The
King's team containing fewer U.L.
players was an unknown quantity but the
fact that they had beaten Reading Univ-
ersity whereas I.C. had lost to them
indicated that a close game would result.
I.C. kicked off and i t immediately
became apparent that the two were very
well matched . The King's pack were
taller on the average but weight for
weight there would have been l i t t l e in
i t . The length of tne legs of the King's
hooker caused some trouble i n the front
row as he was taller than his props,
but he put this to great advantage i n
the tight scrum where I.C. were out-
hooked in the f i r s t half.
Several very well timed kicks by
the backs resulted in I.C. nearly
sooring down the left wing. Banks was
kicking and running very intelligently
to Potter on the left wing and i t was
Just the unlucky bounce of the b a l l ,
which prevented the King's line from be-
ing crossed.
A missed tackle on the right wing
led to the first score of the game when
a King's man broke through to touch down
almost under the posts from whioh an easy
kiok gave King's a five point lead, which
they s t i l l held at half time*
After the resumption I.C, began to
show their capabilities. Always
slow starters I.C. were slower than
usual on this occasion and at times
during the first half one began to wonder
i f they would ever really swing into
action.
Early i n the second half aria
Wroaski, the U.L. skipper, scored a try
from a loose maul on the King's line*
The I.C. scrum half, Diok Lance, was
tackled out of possession, and the
referee playing the advantage rule
allowed Wronski to piqk up the loose
ball and touch down, but Bregazzi's
kick failed.
A few minutes later one of the
King's centres was caught off side as
the I.C. pack pushed their opposite •
numbers towards their line.
A deathly hush f e l l over the ground
as Bregazzi came up to take the kick,
only to be broken by a terrific yell as
the touch judges signalled that I.C. had
taken the lead.
I.C. now went flat out and i t waa
not long before Dick Lance nipped round
the blind side to score a typical scrum
half's try, but unfortunately injuring
his ribs i n the process on colliding
with the f u l l back who had been given a
very harassing time by the I.C, pack.
Mike Bregazzi converted this try with a
magnificent kick from the touch line.
The last try of the game
Otto Gilbert nose- dived his way Over
the back of one of the defenders to
score a well deserved touch down.
Bregazzi again added to the points witn
another beautiful kick.
Although difficult to single out a
any individual players I fool that It
must be pointed out bow magnificently
The I.C. back row played. Both the wing
forwards played excellent games and were
always ready to aid the three-quarters
in attack.
The last word must go to the 80 or
so supporters who made the effort to
give up their time to encourage the team
team. This support is invaluable in
these games, and we hope to see aa many
as possible at harlington when we play
C.E.M. in the next round on February 10th,
She demolition of Guilds baa
started - and on schedule too. First
the north wing,so that the north-east
spline of E 1 oan be built, and at a
later date the entrance, and the south
wing. Of course demolition started long
ago when the o l d warships disappearedt
but only now is the change beooming
apparent to non-Guildsmen,
The building, designed by Water-
house (also the architect of the Natural
History Museum), was formally opened by
the Prince of Wales in I884,having oost
almost twice the original estimated sum
Of £50,000.
By the original proposals the
ground was rented by the City and Guilds
of London Institute (founded and financed
by the City of London, and the Liveried
Companies? from the Commissioners of the
1851 Exhibition on a 999-year lease "at
a peppercorn rent" (one shilling per
year). Also under this proposal - " i f
not begun or finished on time, or i f i t
oeased to be used for technical educa-
tion for the space of one year, the
land and the property on i t shall revert
to the Commissioners".
In a few years there will be
nothing left of this fine building, a
building which has served well, and been
the academic birthplace of many of the
best engineers. Let us hope that the
new buildings will last as well, and
see such talent.
