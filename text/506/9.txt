.and now, by popular demand.
The latest news from I j C . ' s up and coming
sensation. Alexander the Great, Captain
James Cook, Mungo Parke, Christopher Col-
umbus, Burke and Wills, and Marco Polo to
name but a few legendary figures, have all
at one time or another been members of the
I.C. Exploration Society. The extraordinary
and phenomenal interest expressed by mem-
bers of the college has literally forced me
to put pen to paper and to inform any savag-
es lurking out there in the wilds who may
not have heard about this legendayy society
to beware of its gripping powers. Only recen-
tly, several members have been so overcome
by the fascinatingly interesting meetings
that they have found it impossible to miss
a single meeting. While others, finding the
first meeting of last term so provoking, have
walked off into the wilds and have never
been seen since(l).
Back to sanity and truth, the exploration
society had a very active list of events last
term - over one a week on average. The
society is a meeting ground for all people
interested in exploring, and is not a college
travel agency which supplies 'pre-packaged'
holidays to exotic places for those who r e -
quest them. Instead, it is a very useful
means by which people can get ideas for
expeditions, from where to go and what to
do, down to whom to contact for such a
a thing.
FISHING
TRIP
If you fancy a nice cod for breakfast on a
Monday morning, why don't you come for an
all night fishing session with us? We're
thinking of a trip to the E a s t Anglain coast
line (in I.C. transport), to somewhere betw-
een Harwich and Lowestoft probably on Sat.
3rd-Sunday 4th February.
Agenda: 1. Bait digging at low tide on Sat.
2 .Find a nice beach, rock outcrop
or pier, whene a few cod may be
hanging out.
3. Settle down there for a good ni-
ght's fishing.
4. Return to I.C. early Sunday Morn-
ing and crash out.
— Don't worry about not having any tackle;
if you're remotely interested in fishing of
any kind we w i l l be only too pleased to
meet you and have you accompany us. (Note;
the subsidies available should make this a
worthwhile weekend for any fisherman bug-
gered off with London life).
How About It?
Meet in South side Upper Lounge, About
1 o'clock Thurs. 1st Feb. (look out for fish-
ing rods and that w i l l be us), or see Noel
Preston, Room 663, Selkirk H a l l .
Red Cross
The industrial action by drivers and atten»
dants of the London Ambulance Service, who
are members of N A L G O last Monday, left
London without its emergency ambulance
service.
Together with the St. John's Ambulance
Brigade and the R o y a l Army Medical Corp
the Red Cross helped to provide cover for
emergencies over that period.
Their action was confined to " l i f e or death'
emergency only and response was following
requests from the police or doctors only.
The voluntary services made it quite
clear that their action was in no way intend-
ed to b e " s t r i k e b r e a k i n g " but was purely
humanitarian in intention. It i s clear that
without the first c l a s s work of the London
Ambulance Service, the safety and well being
of the population of our capital would be in
jeopardy.
However, the existence of trained volun-
teers within the community, able to respond
to emergencies of any kind, is an essential
adjunct to statutory services.
We need trained volunteers now! Why not
come along to our first aid training s e s s -
ions, on Thursday evenings at 5.30 pm in
the Bot/Zoo Common Room under the Union
Arch.
Since 1956, there have been over eighty
expeditions to areas all over the world.
Each trip has had a specific aim such as
climbing some mountains, discovering a cave
system, while many others have involved
studies of certain aspects of Biology, Met-
eorology, Archaeology, Geology and Social
Behaviour (to name but a few). Due to the
fact that most of the money comes from
sponsors such as industrial firms and
charities, it is necessary " t o do something
worthwhile" on the expedition, and not just
to roam about in some far-away place. The-
re are several expeditions being organised
for next summer.
Meetings last term have consisted of i l l -
ustrated talks by students who have been
on adventures, practical talks on how to go
about planning an expedition, including a
one-day symposium in Leeds on all kinds
of practical aspects, a couple of a s s o c i a -
ted studies talks on polar regions and un-
derwater exploration, and other sundry
events. We also combine meetings with the
Royal Geographical Society (of which we are
corporate members) and these meetings have
varied from talks about volcanoes, to talks
about expedition film making. A l l meetings
have included slides or films as w e l l .
There are many unique facilities at I.C.
for the prospective explorer. The I.C. ex-
ploration Board, which consists of student
union representatives and members of the
academic staff and old student associations,
exists to provide guidance, advice and fin-
ancial support towards an adventure. T h i s ,
> together with the R.G.S., Young Explorers'
Trust (also at the R.G.S.) which can deal
with any problem, means that a wealth of
assistance of every kind is available. T o
find out more (and to stop boring you any
further) come along to any meeting. We ad-
vertise in F E L I X "What's O n " and Topic
and we'll put you on our mailing list if you
drop a note to one of the following comm-
ittee members:
Nick Bedding - Chemistry 2
Anne Vitoria - Zoology 2
Graham Bunn - Physics 3
Our notice board is in the southside cloak-
room area. We'll be having people from the
natural history museum this term as well as
from the R.G.S., and a one day conference
about Africa on February 17.
