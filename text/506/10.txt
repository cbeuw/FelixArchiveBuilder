Aristotle based his political philosophy
largely upon his work on ethics; this atti -
tude towards politics is nowadays generally
ignored as being irrelevant in the " r e a l wor -
Id" . T h i s could well ex plain why the coun â€¢
try is in such a sorry political state ; the
present situation does not even conform to
M a c h i a v e l l i ' s principle since no body has
any very clear aims in mind . Whi le I do not
go s o far a s some historians in suggesting
that the lack of ethics in modern politics is
due entirely to the influence of Lloyd Geor -
ge, there is no room to doubt that he was
completely without ethics.
T h i s does not detract from his s o c i a l ach-
ievements which make him one of our fore-
most s o c i a l reformers; but it is to be remem
bered that no one man, and especially a po-
litician, can devise a social policy. In the
late 19th and early 20th centuries there were
many liberal s o c i a l philosophers who sugg-
ested social reforms which they considered
were required to improve society. Lloyd
George merely put this previous work into
practice. T o do this he had to use highly
questionable methods such as threatening
to create enough liberal peers to pass the
necessary legislation through the L o r d s .
T h i s contempt of established institutions
applied not only to those questionable ones
like the House of Lords but to others, less
controversial, and ultimately the liberal par-
ty itself. The very fact that Lloyd George
obtained so much power before he did any-
thing useful is an indication of his nature.
The p o l i c i e s which put him into office were
reflectionsof previous liberal work; once in
office, as chancellor, he used his position
to obtain even greater power, becoming at
the outset of war, minister of munitions and
finally prime minister. T h e use of manipula- ;
tion and oratory, in both of which he excel-
led, to augment his power without any very
precise policy, apart from the vague state-
ment 'to win the war', is an example of the
unethical aature of politics which he helped
introduce into this country and which has
persisted ever s i n c e . One cannot imagine hm
FILM REVIEW 'ASHANTT
Michael Caine in 'Ashanti'
The N U P E demonstration succeeded in
making me late for the Press Show of " A s h -
a n t i " ( A A , Leicester Sq . Odeon). This
comes hot of the tail of " C a p r i c o r n - O n e "
in that it claims to be even more exciting
and important as it could well be based a r -
ound the unthinkable. On this occasion it
is the existence of a present-day slave
trade from West Africa to the land of Persian
K i n g s . Michael Caine, playing a Doctor
working for the WHO, is on the trail of his
abducted wife. Through the tropical forests
and desert, Suleiman (Peter Ustinov) is s h a -
dowed until the eventual c l i m a x . Privately
funded, and directed by Richard Fleischer
the objectionable fact of this film is that it
is as exploitive of the negros as the action
it portrays. It reminded me so much of the
despicable 'Slavers' of a few months back.
Film makers themselves, see the African as
nothing more than sex objects and merchants
of black magic, giving them no character
and no human responses. Secondly, in this
present day, cinema high adventure unfor-
tunately always seems to mean graduitous
violence and scenes of s i c k n e s s . Next week
I hope to review " M a g i c " (X, Odeon HaymaF
ket) directed by Richard Attenborough.

when the latter, forced to use official mail
for a private letter, had later torn up a stamp.
Lloyd George ultimately destroyed the
liberal party when he attempted to extend the
war time coalition beyond the end of the war
and thus perpetuate his own government. H e
alienatedhalf of his party which refused to
support the government; he did not mend the
breach, an indcation that he did not care
about the fate of his own party. Thus when
the conservatives left him, he had no means
to continue governing since there was no
longer any united liberal party. And soon
there would hardly be any liberal party in
the face of the rising labour party'. T h e Gr-
eek F a t a l i s t s maintained that whatsoever a
man loved most would ultimately destroy
him; L l o y d George's career i s a splendid
exemplification of this ironical attitude.
Therefore the tendency of those recent
historians to praise Lloyd George, or at
least ignore his lack of ethics - a r e doing a
great dis-service to the liberal party; he was
a liberal only in name, but a power seeker
in practice.
A recent example of this form of hagio-
graphy is John Grigg's " L l o y d George" The
People's Champion 1902-1911.

not a fluke, by winning again.

Ian Reed, (of 3rd team fame - see above) played earlier for the

I.C. IV v Gainsford VI (2-7) (Home)
T h i s was a top-of-the-table clash of gargantuan proportions (I
wish I could stop this drivel!) which the fourths lost valiantly -
Rutherford won the two games (we w i l l have to drop him - he's win-
ning too many matches) but they were a l l closely contested. Finally
I discovered that the firsts beat Davies, L a i n g and Dick two weeks
ago by 7 games to 2, but lost by the same margin to B.S.C. 3 3 C l u b

that something was wrong were greatly enhanced by the fact that, at
the last A . C . C . general meeting, none of the gathered captains, were
seen to move or heard to say anything for over an hour. However,
this fact should be totally ignored on the grounds that this i s the
natural state of most of them and the rest were silenced by two of
the A . C . C . exec, who insisted on communicating with one and other
by barking (as in "woof! woof !).
