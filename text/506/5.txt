ALL WELCOME
CITY AND GUILDS
The first rag collection of the term took
place last Saturday. A small group turned
out to brave the cold weather outside Harr-
ods dressed in pyjamas. They proceeded
to collect £300, an excellent collection
(which is higher than at any collection
last year). The President and Hon .Sec.
were noticeable by their absence; they
were at a wedding (not dressed in pyjamas!)
Tonight is the 28th Annual Engineers
Dinner and Dance. T h i s splendid event has
been sold out for the past week. Over 300
people, a record, are attending. It promises
to be an event of true c l a s s with Pans pe -
ople and Jeremy Taylor providing two very
different cabaret acts. An extra bonus is
being thrown in; the third cabaret will be
Mr. Corrigan leading off the first waltz. It
w i l l certainly be a night to remember and
I have no doubts that it will be the best of
the College B a l l s I
Although D & D is the biggest and most
impressive event of the term (and year),
there are several other notable occasions
in the near future. Some dates for your
diaries:
Feb. 16th - G u i l d s / I . F . Valentines Party.
A . J . C . R . Party with a difference; there's
always equal numbers and lots of them.
Feb 20th - F i e l d C u p . Y e s , it's approach-
ing rapidly. Y o u are warned! Find out what
its about and put a team i n .
Feb 21st - Aspirin sales rocket - its Re-
covery Day (funny how it always follows
F i e l d Cup!)
Feb 22nd - Guilds U . G . M .
FRENCH SOC. PARTY
Crepe Suzettes with cider and a good dis -
co with 150 people helped to make last Sat-
urday's French Soc party a social s u c c e s s .
Guillaume, the president of French Soc,
said that he was pleased with the marvell -
ous response. The wonderful turnout was es-
pecially pleasing because it included many
members of I F .
French Soc. hope to hold another event in
February because their first party got the
Society off to such a good start.
MATHS GNOME PARTY
Garden gnomes, windmills, birdbaths and
bus-stops all wandered into the J C R last
Friday for the Maths party. An endless supr>
ly of food, plenty to drink and good music
all served to help the guests have an enjoy-
able time.
The winner of the fancy dress competition
was Andy French complete with fishing rod.
Kirsten, dressed as a windmill, generated a
lot of support.
RCS' border patrol leaves for Oxford St.
UDI OF OXFORD ST.
RCS declared UDI in Oxford Street last •
Saturday. F o r Vh hours they managed to
escape police arrest. Finally the London
constabulary warned our customs and excise
patrols to terminate their extraction of dues
from the tourists passing through R C S ' s bor-
der control. T h i s rag stunt was great fun and
was not designed to raise a large amount of
money.
However, while the Peoples Republic of
Oxford Street was in existence its Treasury
j collected £145 for rag before liquidating its
I assets in the Cockney Pride.
