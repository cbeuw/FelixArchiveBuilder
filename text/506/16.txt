ON FEELING DEPRESSED
Some poet -no doubt the one who s a i d ' A garden i s a loathsome
thing God wot' - described this time of year as a season of m i s t s
and y e l l o w u s e l e s s n e s s . It i s also the season of influenzas, colds
and sore throats. F o r some people it i s a time for feeling depressed
and their mood i s l i k e the grey sky.
We have, I suppose, a l l felt depressed at one time or another.
The individual depth of our despair w i l l vary and the length of time
for which we have this feeling of hopelessness w i l l be considerable
- from a few hours to months.
The trouble with depression i s that when you are feeling depressed
there seems no earthly reason why the feeling should go and when
you are young then y o u don't have the advantage of experience whidi
has taught many people to recognise their depressed periods and to
recognise their own pattern of mood swing. F o r the younger person
these mood swings may be more extreme, varying from heights to
the depths.
Depression brings feelings of guilt and incompetance, sleep d i s -
turbance, a general loss of drive and a difficulty i n thinking clearly
as w e l l as a feeling of p h y s i c a l i l l health. These are some of the
factors w h i c h make it hard to seek help and also difficult for the
doctor to recognise. Indeed when are are low and depressed we can
behave i n quite a self destructive way.
Often depression is selflimiting and quite short, but it c a n be
longer and more severe and very disruptive of study and work
because concentration i s difficult. A l s o the d e c i s i o n s depressed
people take are depressed decisions w h i c h they would not take
when feeling normal. If this sort of depression i s not recognised
then the results can be serious.
Various sorts of depression are d e s c r i b e d . Some people have c y c -
l i c a l mood swings from cheerfulness into gloom. These people often
recognise when they are low - they have been there before - and they
accept that they may always have a down in the Spring or p o s s i b l y
the Autumn. Some people get depressed more e a s i l y by c i r c u m s t a n -
ces although it may not be clear to them what exactly is the circum-
stance which has triggered the depression. L o s s of a close relative
or a friend is not an uncommon trigger and the expression ' l o s s of
a loved object'is one used by P s y c h i a t r i s t s . D e p r e s s i o n is seen as
anger turned inwards against oneself, and anger and guilt are two
common feelings together with that feeling of worthlessness that
occurs in extreme c a s e s .
But depression can also be accompanied by chemical disturbance
in the brain. T h i s is at the junction between the nerves - c a l l e d
neurones - where transmission of messages from one nerve to
another or to many others i s by a c h e m i c a l p r o c e s s . It is this trans-
mitter that becomes less effective while the impulses which pass
along the nerve by an electrical process are unaffected. The pat-
tern of depression caused by this c h e m i c a l disorder is often very
specific and the type of depression is often treated by specific drugs
as w e l l as support and psychotherapy.
Indeed the depression which is reactive to some event or loss can
progress to a chemical depression which colours ones attitude to
life and other people. Not for nothing has it been c a l l e d the ' B l u e
P l a g u e ' .
