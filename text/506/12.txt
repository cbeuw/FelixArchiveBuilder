NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LIBERAL CLUB
Page 22i
Last Tuesday's edition of FORWARD!, the newspaper of Imper-
ial College Liberal Club led with an article stating that the Exec
had 'chickened out' over the refectory boycott. The paper believes
that College still needs to be convinced as to how bad the food rea-
lly is - and an efficient, well-organised 24 hour boycott seems to be
the only way to do this.
F O R W A R D J,in a paragraph on Hugh Barrett's involvement with
London Student Travel notes that he has given repeated assurances
that he would resign his directorship on leaving office as President
of I C U . Hugh i s c r i t i c i s e d because he " h a s made little effort him-
self to vstimulate any i n t e r e s t " in getting suitable people to sit on
the L S T board while remaining a director of the company.
Another item in F O R W A R D ! d i s c u s s e d the 'Media at I C ' . The
article opens by stating that we are very fortunate at Imperial in
that we have three quite excellent media services in F E L I X , IC
Radio and S T O I C . It continues by giving its own answers to the
question, " A r e we- getting the most out of t h e m ? "
The c r i t i c i s m of production, staff and personal aspects provoked
immediate and angry response e s p e c i a l l y from I C Radio and S T O I C .
Although there are a l l round c r i t i c i s m s in F O R W A R D ! the media
are particularly upset. It looks a s if this topic w i l l drag on for some
time. A n o f f i c i a l P r e s s Release from IC L i b e r a l C l u b is printed.be-

The article on 'Media at IC' which appeared in the January issue
of FORWARD '.contained the suggestion that the National Westmin-
ster Bank might be offering IC Radio a sum in excess of £1000 in
exchange for advertising their branch in the Sherfield Building, and
this was followed by a discussion on how such money - if offered-
should be spent-. This was reported as a rumour. Rumours remain
as such until discounted by fact. In this case, it appears that a mis-
understanding may have arisen and we are now convinced that such
a suggestion has no foundation in fact.
The same article alsoi discussed the editorial nature of STOIC,
and the opinions expressed, we feel, were fully justified.
The Committee of IC Liberal Club appointed Paul Fairbairn as
Editor of FORWARD! and entrusted him with responsibility for en-
suring, to the best of his ability, that the views expressed gener-
ally reflect the views of members of the Club as a whole. Articles,
therefore, do not express individual points of view, and are not
credited to particular contributors. This has been so for every edi-
tion of FORWARD! in -its two years of publication. It is our view
that individual opinions should be put through FELIX or other IC
Union media.
The right to criticise both organisations and individuals in the
public eye should be upheld at all cost.
F O R W A R D ! - S T O I C ' s Reply
I was most annoyed to see that an article published recently in
FORWARD! - the news paper of IC Liberal Club - contained allega-
tions about the management and editorial control of STOIC.
I feel it is important to point out that the control of S T O I C is to -
tally in the hands of its student membership. C o l i n Grimshaw, the
studio staff member, has the role of purely a technical supervisor,
and he is only concerned with the direction of programmes i.e. vis -
ual and audio q u a l i t y . Experience in this s p e c i a l i s t field takes a
llong time to acquire, and C o l i n ' s could not be matched by any of
our members. It is a l s o a College rule that one of the studio staff
be present at all times whilst - S T O I C are there: C o l i n , who is C o -
llege staff (not employed by Electrical Engineering as stated in
F O R W A R D ! ) , is in fact the only person qualified in College to a s -
s i s t in such a manner. Whilst we maintain technical control, we feel
that C o l i n ' s a d v i c e h a s always been a major factor in the high tech-
nical standard of our programmes, and it is very much appreciated.
Concerning the comment that ' S T O I C . . . shy away from material of
a serious nature' I would like to remind the author that the last two
editions have contained items on ICU elections, A S T M S dispute,
housing and accommodation problems, refectory prices and the threa-
tened N U P E strike. Personally I would regard these as serious.
It has been put forward in defence of the article that F O R W A R D !
is regarded as a joke by IC students. However, I feel this is not the
case, and anything a s s o c i a t i n g itself with the L i b e r a l Party, which
is definetely not a joke, is going to be read in a l l seriousness.
A more disturbing aspect of this feature is that it was written
anonymously by a member of ICU P u b l i c a t i o n s Board (STOIC'S
governing body). It seems very unfortunate that a member oLan ICU
major subcommittee feels frightened to openly c r i t i c i s e another
member organization of that committee and has to resort to anonymous
defamation and non-constructive c r i t i c i s m .
Obviously S T O I C has recently been through a demoralising few
months caused by the A S T M S dispute, and resulting in a diminished
membership, but the statement 'To be frank, there seems little hope
of improvement' Is, I feel, totally unjustified.

Chairman, STOIC
PS A l s o , p l e a s e note that despite allegations of being unimagina -
tive and having no forward planning, S T O I C transmitted the first in
a series of many of a totally new Tuesday programme this week.
They w i l l feature many of the C l u b s and Societies at IC and we
have received a lot of interest concerning these.
Eds note ; Roger Stotesbury has never made any secret of the fact
that he wrote that article as an individual. I feel that to have put
his position in the Union at the foot of the article would have
implied that it was the opinion of Pub. Board as a whole which
would be wrong.

Mary Attenborough c l a i m s that prices should only have gone up by
half these amounts as basic food prices form only half of the cost
of the refectory s e r v i c e . Other costs such as staff wages, equipme -
nt, electricity and gas are unaffected by increased food costs and so
the amount paid by the customer for these elements should remain
unchanged.
When the regulator was set up
it was understood that its use
would be limited to the cost of
food. The minutes of the Refect-
ory F i n a n c e Subcommittee of that
time record that: " A f t e r much dis-
cussion the Committee decided
that it would be wrong to use the
regulator to cover costs other
than r i s e s in food p r i c e s " . But

equivalent overall rises in refec-
Committee Chairman Professor
E i l o n refused to allow a vote on
this proposal saying thav he would
" n o t allow the Committee to take
irresponsible d e c i s i o n s " . He
maintained that this was a com-
pletely new proposal which would
first have to be d i s c u s s e d by the
Finance Subcommittee. He a l s o
refused to permit the suspension
of the regulator pending a d e c i -
sion as to its future use. Howev-
er, Domestic Secretary Captain
Lindley intimated that the regu-

ing on Thursday last week I C U ' s -uary.
eight representatives raised this Professor E i l o n , when asked by
matter and proposed that the use a F E L I X reporter for his comments
of the regulator be limited to food on the use of the regulator, refu-
c o s t s in future. But Refectory sed to answer any questions.
