F O R W A R D Attacks Media
F O R W A R D , the newspaper of Imperial College Liberal Club,
launched an unprecedented three-pronged attack on the media, and
the individuals in them, in an article entitled " M e d i a at I C " last
Tuesday.
I know that the intention of that article was to provoke d i s c u s s -
ion on problems discerned within the media and to that end it
succeeded! Unfortunately, there were many repercussions that
were unforeseen.
Admission
I, for my part, would like to take responsibility for the IC Radio
section as I supplied the details that appeared in the text. I did not
fabricate any of them, however, but merely relayed rumours that I
felt would creat debate. I am sorry if these rumours were unfounded
and for any distress I may have caused John Allen in disrupting his
team. I particularly appreciate the difficulty created for Karen and
Harvey.
Complacency
I feel very strongly that any group which remains un-criticised
for too long becomes complacent and therefore fails to provide their
best. Each media at IC has its own particular internal problems and
being reminded of them from time t o time can only do good. Sensa-
tionalist material of the kind I provided, however, achieves nothing
especially as Tdidn't have the g u t s " to sign my name.
STOIC
May I appeal to Colin Grimshaw that, rather than reinforce the
opinions of the author of the STOIC section, he continues to pro-
vide the technical help that STOIC relies on.
Staff wanted
Volunteers are needed to work on F E L I X , this newspaper. News
reporters and paste-up artists are especially required but any short
stories, reviews etc. will be welcome. If there is sufficient response
then I w i l l organize a " g u i d e d tour" of the print unit to familiarise
everyone with techniques of production.
Refectory Boycott
It was with dismay that I watched a UGM vote to continue with a
boycott of Southside refectories. What is the use of threatening to
have a boycott if prices increase if the boycott goes ahead anyway
when they don't? What can the Union threaten next time? It seems
to me that we will only lose credibility and harden attitudes by this
course of action. If there are those who wish to complain about
quality I suggest they do so via the complaints books and letters to
F E L I X rather than using the ultimate weapon at the first opportunity.
Credits
Firstly, Paul Williams for his superb cartoon. David Crable pro-
mised to buy me two pints if I wrote the following: It seems a very
sad, nay, disastrous day when one printed publication has little
better to do then gang up on three worthwhile media. Cheers. Dave!
Thanks also to John, Sonia, Colin and Sheyne for photos, paste-ups,
stories and collating in no particular order. Anita typed her largest
F E L I X to date, and Ian printed it a l l in two days (if he prints it all
in two days that is). Cheers,
John
P S The Compset 550 has just arrived!
ALL AROUND THE QUADRANGLE
A non-female was spotted inside the 'Ladies' on the Union Build-
ing's first floor last Friday. Well, he is a braver person that I.
The girls' room is nicely situated between the Union Ear and
Dramsoc. These are both full of heavily built human beings just i t -
ching to go into battle.
Only two days earlier there was a false rape alarm. It's amazing
how quickly people arrive on the scene. A special "three c h e e r s "
for Big Malcolm, who managed to put on his shoes whilst sprinting
across'the Quad.
If anyone else is seen in these ' L a d i e s ' who obviously shouldn't
be there let Malcolm know. A l s o anybody who is likely to fool around
up there just for a joke, I offer one word of advice. D O N ' T . You
won't find it so funny afterwards.
Good for Mary for pointing out that E l -Vino's discriminate again-
st women in not allowing them to be served at the bar. I noticed no
mention was made of this in the advert! However I'm afraid I shall
not be supporting a boycott even though I do not approve of this
practice. I hope I can be forgiven for feeling that such action will
solve little. I think it's an unfortunate venue and I trust that an
alternative will be found in future.
Did you know that F E L I X distributes about a million sheets of
paper during a students nominal three year stay at I.C. I wonder how
many trees that is?
On paper the prospects are terrific: theatre, cinema, nightclub and
concert music from opera to folk, jazz and orchestral.
With these all seasoned by a promised topical debate I feel-sure
that students can for once have " C i t y entertainment in the 'home'
so to speak.
Next S C A B evening needs to be a great s u c c e s s . I see no reason
why it cannot be so. L e t ' s forget previous events and make sure
that the right people are encouraged to attend a great evening's
entertainment.
It's not too early to plan for next year when considering this sort
of event.
The Union Lower Lounge looks great, though someone's bound to
d i s l i k e the colour scheme. The new carpet should arrive over the
Easter vacation.
Some D . P . from the distant past had lino, laid around the bar so
preventing the wooden floor from breathing. T h i s should be put to
rights quite soon with the rotten wood floor being replaced by c o n -
crete .
Despite ail this, the atmos rhere in the Lower Lounge has not
altered.
From a well known hymn: " C h a n g e and Decay in A l l Around I..C.
0 Thou That Changest Not, Abide With M e . "
Would someone please explain why Beit Fire Bell sounded with
the rape alarm. It's got me quite worried. Cheers !

I do not wish to comment on the last S C A B N I T E , but what of
next year. S o c i a l , Cultural and Amusement Board consist of those
I.C. societies presenting formal entertainment.
