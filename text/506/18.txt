What you can get from
The Welfare Centre
Welfare Fair
Next Wednesday, as you may have heard, there w i l l be a grand
event in the J C R during the afternoon. T h e emphasis w i l l be on
entertainment more than anything else, but the underlying motive
is to give y o u some idea of any of the H e a l t h and Welfare services
i n the college which you may not yet have had any personal c o n -
tact with and also to introduce other organisations which are c o n -
cerned with helping the individual to'survive i n an increasingly
hostile environment. We also hope to show you that these s u b -
jects) are not only relevant when you need them but that they are
interesting enough to be thought about even when they don't d i r -
ectly affect you. In this i s s u e of F E L I X , you w i l l find artcles by
the other college Welfare services and i n that context, you might
be interested to know something more about the Welfare Centre and
the k i n d of problems and i s s u e s that i t deals w i t h .
The Welfare Centre has now been operating on a full time basis
for j u s t over a year and during that time there has been a c o n s i d -
erable expansion i n the numbers of people u s i n g i t , so that las*
term, for example, therej were over 1200 enquiries handled.
So, what's i t a l l about? Well there are two sides to the Welfare
Centre's work, answering questions and so on from people who v i s i t
us and working on projects which affect sections of the college
rather than i n d i v i d u a l s .
The most important topic, which affects everybody at some time
or other i s housing. The main options available at present when
one i s looking for somewhere to live are the University A c c o m m -
odation Office, which has a problem i n that i t i s very heavily used
and s o can't always come up with what you want, and flat agencies
which often charge a great deal of money for doing virtually nothing-
even i f y o u can find one that i s prepared to help you. In this cont-
ext, the role of the Student Union i s clearly very important to f i l l
the considerable gaps left by other sources of accommodation. T h e
Union i s i n a fortunate position in this respect in that i t i s an organ-
isation which gives it an advantage over individual home hunters
in a number of w a y s : -
Bedsits etc.
L a n d l a d i e s seem very choosy these days about the kind of people
that theyljlet their rooms to, owing to the restrictions that are
imposed upon them by l a w when i t comes to dealing with bad
tenants. A s a result, they feel much happier having someone from
an identifiable source because they feel, rightly or wrongly, that
this gives them some guarantee as to the character of the prospect-
ive tenant and a l s o someone to talk to i f thearrangement goes wrong.
With this i n mind, we have been actively recruiting this type of
accommodation with the result that there are at present over four
hundred landladies on our books, many of them as much concerned
with helping people who have nowhere to live as with making any
great profit themselves.
Although this i s a step i n the right direction, it only goes a small
way to s o l v i n g the problem as a whole and ojher schemes are being
examined, which again rely h e a v i l y on the existence of the Union
and would be virtually i n a c c e s i b l e to the i n d i v i d u a l on his or her
own.
Company lets
Those of you who have been through the harrowing experience
of looking for somewhere to l i v e have probably come up against
landlords and agencies who are only prepared to let to companies
and a n answer to this would be for the Union to set up a comp-
any w h i c h could then take on this kind of tenancy. The problem
with this i s that i t i s blatant avoidance of the Rent Acts and i s
therefore a matter of weighing up the moral issues involved against
the potential advantages to be gained.
Head Tenancies
T h i s i s the kind of arrangement where the U n i o n would take on
p l a c e s , u s u a l l y from b i g corporate landlords, and then let them to
students, w h i c h means that they wouldn't be Rent A c t protected.
The kind of accommodation that one could get in this way would
probably not normally be available to students on a protected tenan-
cy, if at a l l , because the main concern of b i g landlords i s to main-
tain the value of their investment and so it would be most prejud-
i c i a l to their objectives i f they were to allow any of their o c c u p -
iers to come w i t h i n the Rent A c t s . It i s interesting to note that
this option i s not a Rent A c t loophole but a specific exception to
the Rent A c t s , presumably designed to cope with the special needs
of students and c o l l e g e s .
Housing Associations
T h i s i s something that c o u l d be set up in the same way as the b i g
H o u s i n g A s s o c i a t i o n s are with a loan from the H o u s i n g Corporation.
There are a number of obstacles to be overcome but we are at present
examining the viability of the U n i o n ' s involvement in such a scheme.
Local Authority Accommodation
From time to time, l o c a l authorities decide that b l o c k s of c o u n c i l
flats or bits of blocks are more trouble than they are worth, e.g. b e -
cause no one wants to l i v e i n them. They are then quite w i l l i n g to
hive them off to other organisations like student Unions. They don't
tend to be the last word in desirable residences but they are u s u a l l y
very cheap and we want to be i n a position to leap i n i f there are any
up for grabs.
D i s c u s s i o n s on many of these projects are at a very early stage at
present but it i s hoped that i n time something w i l l come of them and
that we w i l l then be able to solve our housing shortage for once and
for a l l .
Other areas of work which f a l l into the category of sectional rather
than individual help are our attempts to get L o c a l E d u c a t i o n Author-
ities to change their tune on giving grants to overseas students who
have been here for three years and helping with legal type problems
that arise i n the context of the Union a s a whole.
A s far as i n d i v i d u a l enquiries go, they tend to be very varied-the
sort of thing one might go to a Neighbourhood L a w Centre or a C i t i z -
ens A d v i c e Bureau for. F o r example:-
Finding Somewhere To Live
The Welfare Centre has a fair s i z e d l i s t of landlords and u s u a l l y
some current v a c a n c i e s as long as y o u are not too fussy about l i v i n g
a few miles from college. There i s also a l i s t of flat agencies w h i c h
might come i n useful.
Landlord Problems
These are not infrequent as some landlords do not seem to r e a l i s e
that their tenants have a right to be treated as human beings rather
than inmates of a boarding kennels. T h e legal ramifications of this
subject are such that it i s best to come along to the Welfare Centre
for a chat about i t if you feel that a breakdown i n relations with
your landlord i s i n the offing.
Consumer matters
If you buy something from a shop and it turns out to have some-
thing wrong with it, you can u s u a l l y take it back and choose bet-
ween your money back and a replacement. Y o u don't have to accept
a credit note. If on the other hand you buy something from a private
individual, there i s no statutory protection and your rights depend
entirely on your agreement with the s e l l e r - i . e . i f the seller makes
a statement about the thing you are buying, which turns out to be
untrue then you may be able to get your money back but i f you buy
something from someone who doesn't make any promises about what
you are buying and it turns out to be useless then there i s nothing
much y o u can do about it.
Welfare Benefits
You can find out at the Welfare Centre about supplementary bene-
fit, Unemployment Benefit, free glasses, and other such things.
Covenants
There w i l l be a change i n the tax arrangements i n A p r i l w h i c h
means that parents no longer get a c h i l d tax allowance. The s i g n i -
ficance of this is that anyone who is i n receipt of a parental contri-
bution to their grant can increase their income from their parents by
half as much again simply by getting their parents to sign a deed of
covenant. E v e n now most people who don't get a full grant c o u l d
reap substantial benefits i n this w a y .
Contacts with the P o l i c e
Most policemen are concientious upholders of the l a w and c i v i l i -
sation as we know it. A l s o , everyone has lots of 'rights' to prevent
them from suffering i n j u s t i c e s . Unfortunately, however, some p o l i c e -
men (it i s rumored) are a bit too concientious and your rights are so
complicated and riddled with exceptions that it can be dangerous to
rely on them. The golden rule then, i s to desist from annoying any
policemen with whom you come into contact but to avoid at a l l costs
any attempts to make you say or write anything which c o u l d incrim-
inate you. T h e right to s i l e n c e , although under fire, i s s t i l l sacro-
sanct. The other thing worth remembering i s your right under the
Criminal L a w A c t to make a phone c a l l from the p o l i c e station, i f you
are arrested, to let someone i n the outside world know where you are.
Most people only have contact with the police i n the context of
motoring offences and if you want any information on the sentences
and defences available I should be able to give you some i n d i c a -
tion.
The Welfare Centre can also help with any legal enquiries or
with other related topics.
Anyway, don't forget to come along to the J . C . R . on Wednesday
- even i f i t ' s only for the beer.
