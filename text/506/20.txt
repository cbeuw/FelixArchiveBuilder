Welfare Day and Sex
On Wednesday, amongst all the other things you can find out more
about, are contraception and abortion. The Family Planning Associa-
tion will be there as well as British Pregnancy Advisory Service.
Contraception
A normally fertile woman having regular sexual intercourse with
a normally fertile man stands about a 6 0 % chance of getting pre-
gnant in anyone month. So if you don't want to have kids its a good
idea to use some safe, effective contraception.
There are various methods that can be used.
1. Condom - (rumoured to be a very effective form of contraception
as it puts most people off the whole idea), is a rubber sheath placed
over an erect penis in order to stop semen from entering the v a g i n a .
Theoretically the condom should be about 97% effective, i.e. 3
women out of 100 becoming pregnant in any one year. However, the
actual figure is only 8 0 % effective, (arising from people who may
claim to use this method failing to use it or not using it properly).
Their effectiveness is increased to 9 8 % (theoretical) and 9 5 % (in
practice) if used in conjunction with a spermicide.
The great advantage of condoms is that they are available without
going for medical advice. L o t s of loos have dispensing machines in
them (e.g. the L a d i e s Lop in the union building) or they can be ob-
tained, without prescription, from a chemist.
2. Spermicides
It is not advisable to use these on their own as they are not part-
icularly effective. They are used in conjunction with a condom (see
1) or cap (see 3).
Spermicides act in two ways: by k i l l i n g sperm and by creating a
barrier of foam or fluid through which sperm cannot pass into the
uterus.
There are lots of different types of spermicides, creams, j e l l i e s
and aerosols. Some women may find that they irritate their genitals.
3. Caps
T h e most used type of cap is the diaphragm. C a p s fit across a
womarfs cervix (entrance to the uterus). It has to be fitted initially
by a doctor or nurse as it needs to be the right s i z e for the i n d i v i d -
ual woman.
The cap is placed in position not more than 2 hours before inter-
course and left in place for at least 8 hrs afterwards and in order to
be at a l l effective has to be used in conjunction with spermicide.
Used in conjunction with spermicide it is theoretically 97% effec-
tive but only 75% in practice.
The cap and condom are particularly useful if you are not getting
it regularly but on a more regular basis could become a bit of a drag.
For this reason I.U.D.'s (coils or loops) and p i l l s are favoured by
lots of younger women, though they have drawbacks in relation to the
possible side-effects.
4. The I.U.C. (coil or loop)
Intrauterine device (which I shall c a l l a coil from now on) is fitted
by a trained person, and can remain in place for 2-3 years. Copper 7
(and the similar Copper T) are the most common to be fitted to
women who have not had children.
It is not exactly known how c o i l s work and they are only effective
while in place, (they may fall out during menstruation). Their other
draw-back is that they can give severe discomfort just after fitting
and a l s o increase menstrual loss (with accompanied greater pain).
They are about 9 5 % effective.
5. The P i l l
The most widely used type of pill is the combination pill i.e. con-
taining oestrogen and progesterone. On the fifth day after menstru-
ation a woman begins to take the pill then once a day for 21 days
then has 7 days free, then starts a l l over again.
T h i s pill works by preventing ovulation, by affecting the uterus
lining so that inplantation could not occur and by causing c e r v i c a l
mucus to thicken, forming a barrier to sperm.
The main disadvantages are that remembering to take it can
become a neurotic o b s e s s i o n . There are lots of side effects e.g.
headaches, nausea, s w o l l e n or tender breasts, vaginal discharges,
depression, and risk of blood c l o t t i n g .
The combined pill is theoretically 99% effective (though only
95% in practice).
The continuous pill contains progesterone only, is taken a l l the
time and also has some interesting side effects but risks should
be less as it contains no oestrogen. It is about 96% effective.
(90% in practice).
Other methods
Are not very effective, (except sterilisation.) The method is
selected abstinance based on the fact that ovulation takes place
at about 14 days after the beginning of menstruation, but in pract-
ice is even less effective than withdrawal.
Where to get it
Contraceptives are free to all women and can be obtained from
1. Most doctors (on prescription) including the college health
centre who are only too pleased to help.
2. The Family Planning A s s o c i a t i o n . Despite the title you don't
have to be. married. The nearest branch is in Holland Street, W.8
open on Tuesdays and Wednesdays 5.30 - 7 . 3 0 . (937 4385)
3. Brook Advisory C l i n i c . 233 Totterham C t . Road, W.1
(323 1522)
S p e c i a l i s e s in the young and generally unmarried though anyone
can go.
4 . Condoms can be bought from chemists or from machines in L o o s .
(Unfortunately men cannot get them free from Birth Control c l i n i c s ) .
Other ways of avoiding pregnancy are abstaining or less extreme-
ly having homosexual or lesbian relationships. These, of course,
have their own problems. Welfare Day can s t i l l help as the Campaign
for Homosexual Equality will be there to talk about Gay R i g h t s .
Abortion
There are lots of different types of abortion. Abortion is generally
safer than continuing a pregnancy and childbirth.
The most common method of abortion is carried out between 7-12
weeks and is by suction (properly c a l l e d D i l a t i o n and Evacuation
or D H E ) . The foetus is removed by suction through a narrow tube
inserted through the c e r v i x .
The abortion takes about 10 mins and can be done in a outpatient
c l i n i c .
Where to go
Your doctor may refer you for an abortion on the National H e a l t h .
If not, do not despair there are two charities in London.
1. The British Pregnancy Advisory Service. 58 Petty France,
V i c t o r i a S.W.1 (222 0985)
2. Pregnancy Advisory Service 43 Margeret St., W1*(409 0 281)
Both do cheap pregnancy testing (about £2) and can arrange abor-
tions for about £60 or l e s s . (They also have a good c o u n s e l l i n g
service).
Growing up
A l s o for your delight and enjoyment the controversial film 'Growing
U p " will be shown on Wednesday Afternoon.
The film " G r o w i n g U p " has a fifteen second sequence of inter-
course and scenes of a woman and a boy masterbating.
Before you say that this seems harmless enough I must warn you
of a few comments made by my mentor Mary Whitehouse. Bearing
in mind of course that " S e x u a l anarchy is the forerunner of p o l i t i c -
al a n a r c h y " . She quotes an individual c a l l e d Mary M i l e s (supposed-
ly an eminent educationalist and psychotherapist) who says that
" t h e whole question of group education about sex is open to. doubt"
and goes on to say that " D r . C o l e ' s film may well reassure a d o l e -
scents that masturbation is not harmful p h y s i c a l l y , but it does not
and cannot touch the deeper and more important point, that the
fantasies contained in masturbation vary widely, and it is these
that cause anxiety and guilt. In some people masturbation is com-
pulsive and unsatisfying, in some girls and women it can be related
to their unresolved conflict over not having a p e n i s " .
