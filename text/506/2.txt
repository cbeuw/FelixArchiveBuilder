Dear Sir, -I haven't made any se - service to whoever they w i s h . A
cret of the fact that I think society very admirable state of affairs
i s repressive towards women, and
as such am prepared to do some-
thing about it. It would be nice if
men and women could work toge-
ther to eliminate discrimination
and repression wherever it exists
with regard to both sex and race.
T h i s w i l l never come about, how-
ever, i f groups such a s WIST (Wo-
men i n Science and Technology)
continue to operate in what can
only be described as an antagon-
istic fashion. Waging a 'sex-war'
can only be counter-productive.
Their ludicrous claim that only
women can understand how women
are repressed can do nothing to
change men's attitudes - rather it
serves to strengthen them.
"Women o n l y " meetings (such
as last week's WIST meeting) are
to be condemned as discriminat-
ory just as "men o n l y " events
certainly do not inspire others
(both men and women) with sym-
pathy or understanding.
People should campaign again-
st sexism as individuals - b e c a u s
in the end it i s the individual
which I hope w i l l continue for a
very long time.
Yours, In increasing fear of loos-
ing my right of freedom of choice
and expression,

Sir, - A t the risk of provoking yet
further response on the topic, I
feel compelled to answer the
letter in last week's F E L I X from
Mary Attenborough.
A s the organiser of this year's
F E L I X Dinner, I chose the part-
icular venue for a number of rea-
sons. F i r s t l y , the Dinner was to
be held outside College; I felt it
time that the traditional strangle-
hold that the College Refectory
service has over such functions
should be broken, thereby offering
the diners the possibility of
decent food and reasonable cost.
Secondly, I tried to find a ven-
ue that had some link with the
newspaper industry; Fleet Street
i s the obvious location, and E l
V i n o the company which immed-
iately springs to mind.
B y attending the Dinner, one
(either man or woman) who w i l l be I n o m o r e registers a vote i n favour
of the political opinions of the
management then one would show
support of, for example, Victor
Mooney's by eating in the College
Refectories or the knickers i n the
Union B a r by drinking there. I
have observed Mary doing both.
The fact that, in a separate bar,
the management of E l Vino pract-
ise a forni of sexual discrimina-
tion does not mean that those
attending the Dinner favour this.
They are supporting F E L I X , this
College's newspaper.
Yours faithfully,
Duncan Suss
Dear Sir, - It has become increa-
singly difficult to obtain a copy
of F E L I X on Friday mornings -
even by arriving early in the De-
partment. Many of my friends on
other courses and particularly
P . G . s have expressed similar
problems.
It is sad that the present supply
does not seem to satisfy the de-
mand.
F E L I X is tremendously impor-
tant to college life and so I think
it would be a good idea to increa-
se publication from the present
three thousand odd to a figure
nearer the number of students a t -
tending I.C.
Yours faithfully,

Eds note - In response to this and
other requests that departments
receive more copies, from the
messengers particularly, for a
trial period the print run of FELIX
will be increased from 30CXJ to
4<>W-„
better off when sexism no longer
pervades our society.
The sooner people like Mary
Attenborough and Sonia Hoch -

Dear Editor, - In common, I guess,
with most readers of F E L I X I no-
ticed with considerable irritation
the seemingly petty letter from
M s . Attenborough concerning the
' E l V i n o ' restaurant in last week's
F E L I X . However on second
thoughts I realised that this letta
represented a far more serious
matter than i t at first seemed to,
it in fact represents a direct at-
tack on the freedom of the i n d i -
vidual - in this case the owner/
management of ' E l V i n o ' - by a
frighteningly large minority with-
in society today.
T h i s group of people in their
fanatical devotion to the imposs-
ible and perhaps undesirable aim
of absolute equality (after a l l ,
are not the people of Democratic
Campouchia more 'equal' than the
people of U . K . and how many
Britains could honestly say that
they would rather live in Campou-
chia?) are prepared to sacrifice
the freedom of choice of the indi-
vidual which exists in this count-
ry today making it the best coun-
try in the world to live in Can int-
eresting point to note is that Bri -
tain was the only country that
would allow Karl Marx to live and
work in it). A n
y ° n e w n o
disputes
this may leave the country and go
anywhere they care to go, a
choice which very few people in
the world today are lucky enough
to have.
Dear Editor, - My letter is partic-
u l a r l y addressed u> those male
chauvenist boars who inhabit
C A G . It is a universally agreed
B y law, the owners of ' E l Vine? problem that there is a l a c k of wo -
in common with those of a l l other men here and the reason seems
license d premisses may refuse obvious to me - it does not appre-
ciate the women it has - if it did,
they might very w e l l multiply!
For example, those disgusting
rugger songs that surface on bar
nights and on coaches - perhaps
the amusing side of these is be-
yond my intellect? There also
seems to be a large proportion of
men who totally ignore the women,
while harping on about I.F. and
other girls - perhaps they don't
realise how much it can hurt those
girls who are shy, sensitive and
lonely. A t the moment, a l l I could
say to a prospective woman stud-
ent engineer is - learn from my
mistake and go elsewhere. I w i l l
end by thanking those few men
who have treated me as a fellow
human being and made my college
life bearable - they w i l l make
super husbands, one day!

| Sir, - Some of your readers may
already be aware of the reported
sighting of a " P e e p i n g T o m " last
Friday night in the ladies toilets
in the Union B u i l d i n g . T h i s part-
icularily unsavoury incident occur-
ed about 10.30 pm and took the
jform of peeping under the door of
i an occupied cubicle. The girl
[concerned was unable to raise the
rape alarm as it was safest to re-
imain inside the cubicle. Having
I sworn at the peeper who then seem-
ied to go away, the girl waited un-
t i l she heard other footsteps
before leaving the toilets. A sear-
ch of the Union Building a few
minutes later proved fruitless.
1
Whether the man (described as
negroid, with chubby features)
was contemplating rape, or was
merely getting some k i c k s in a
rather s i c k way is irrelevant -
this type of incident is extreme-
ly unnerving for any girl. I would
hope that it was not a member of
Imperial College Union who was
the perpertrator of the incident.
Attacks on women and girls using
j the E a s t staircase toilets have
been occurring at the rate of three
or four a year for the last four
years. Although two rape alarm
buttons have been installed in
those toilets, they are not inside
the cubicles and are situated at
shoulder level and as such are
easily set off accidentally. P e r -
haps it would be worthwhile for
the Union to install buttons i n
a l l the cubicles and at such
a height that they are easily a c c -
essible in an emergency, but not
prone to accidental triggering?
Furthermore, perhaps the C o l -
lege Security Officer, Mr. Dawson,
could give some indication of how
he thinks would-be attackers from
outside the College can be d i s -
couraged from even entering the
Union Building.
In an article in F E L I X N o . 504,
Sheyne L u c o c k referred to the
Reclaim the Night Campaign
which is attemtping to make the
streets safe for women to walk on
their own at night. A very commen-
dable ideal indeed. However when
even our own campus is obvious-
ly not a safe place for women to
be, I feel that something more
tangible in the short term is
required. Perhaps more effective
deterrents and some increased
security are small steps in the
right direction? .
Yours etc..

Dear John, -I must write and com-
ment on the article about I.C. Rad-
io in today's edition of the I.C.
L i b e r a l C l u b newspaper 'Forward'.
The article, by an un-named auth-
or, is not only misinformed, but
also damaging both to me person-
ally and the station.
To answer some of the specific
points:
There has never been any deal
between I.C. Radio and the Nat.
West. Bank. I had d i s c u s s e d the
possibility of a small donation in
the order of £100 with one of
their staff; this could not lead to
advertising on the station as our
Home Office licence does not per-
mit outside commercials.
A s far as reception is concern-
ed, in the past four College weeks
there have been five major chan
-ges to the transmission system
to try and improve reception, with
considerable s u c c e s s . However
any changes that we make h a v e
to be within limits set by the
Home Office which does not give
us much scope for manoeuvre.
When a radio station increases
its broadcasting from 35 to 60
hours a week, and changes its
format away from 'juke box muzak'
it is inevitable that more staff
are required, certainly our staff
turnover is no greater than in ma-
ny union organizations, less than
in most. To answer the other two
points briefly. I certainly do ex-
pect news to be heard on I.C. R a -
dio before it appears in F E L I X
(radio is an immediate medium,
publishing a newspaper has an
inevitable delay) and as far as a
successor is concerned there are
a number of student stations in
the U . K . which change their (un-
dergraduate) station managers
every year. (Many of them broad-
cast for double the hours of I.C.
Radio). If L i b e r a l C l u b have e v i -
dence that it is not possible here,
perhaps they should present their
evidence.
I hope that after reading the
above, members of the L i b e r a l
Club (particularly the author of
the article who didn't have the
guts to give his or her name) w i l l
find themselves able to issue a
public apology for the article to
both myself and our loyal staff.
Otherwise I am considering tak-
ing action on two of the points
in it, as my legal advice suggests
that the article has libelled both
myself and the station.
Yours Sincerely,
John Allen
Station Manager, I.C. Radio
