W.E.C.V.S.
W E C V S is the West End Co-oidinated Vo-
luntary Services and has been set up to help
solve the problems of the many single, home-
less, and often jobless, young people in
central London. It comprises of six agenci-
es which offer a broad range of solutions to
the single homeless. They are:
1) Centre Point Emergency Services provide
basic accommodation and counselling sup-
port for young people, most of whom have
recently arrived in the c i t y . Help and encou-
ragement are given to residents so that they
can become self-sufficient in obtaining per-
manent employment and accommodation.
2) Intake is a mixed hostel where emphasis
is p l a c e d on taking an active part i n the run-
ning of the h o s t e l .
3) New Horizon is a day-time base for
young people who are homeless and rootless
in the West E n d . A s well as advice and help

Police R a d i o System
Is it a bird? Is it a plane? Is it an obscure
punk-rock group? No, it's the second ever
Radio Society F E L I X article! So why is it
headed " P o l i c e Radio System"? Because
that is the title of our very first venture in-
to the field of multi-media entertainment!
A t 2.15 p.m. on February 28th, Mr. David
Chapman (G3NGK), will be giving a talk on,
and demonstration of, police radios. I've a l -
ready seen this talk, and can guarantee it to
be interesting. It includes s l i d e s of how
" 9 9 9 " c a l l s are dealt with, and a real live
demonstration of talking to a policeman on
the beat (gasp!). Mr. Chapman will a l s o be
talking about technical careers with the Me-
tropolitan P o l i c e . Non-members are welcome
to this event, and if successful it could be
the start of a regular series of Radio Socie-
ty t a l k s . Venue is yet to be arranged, so keep
your eyes on the "What's On " page.
If you don't get on too w e l l with policeman,
how about our second talk, scheduled for
March? T h i s is from Mr. Anthony A s k e w
( G 4 B P C ) , and w i l l encompass broadcasting,
music, mixing, stereo, microphone techni-
ques, and much else besides. The talk is
illustrated with a collection of tape record-
i n g s , w h i c h w i l l be reproduced courtesy of
Audio Soc! Although you may not have heard
of Tony, you've probably heard some of his
After rummaging through the mad chaos
that exists in my mind, in order to find some
thing to enthrall all the literary people out
there, I decided this week, what with all the
election rumours that are floating around,
was a good time for a job description of Hon.
Secretary - so if anybody out there is think-
ing of standing, you know what it entails.
F i r s t and foremost - y o u ' d better get to
like duplicating ' c o s that's what you spend a
lot of time doing any duplicating that needs
to be done, the H o n . Sec. has to do it. F o r
C o u n c i l , U G M s , numerous committees, Exec.
News (when it can't be printed) plus numer -
ous other little jobs that crop up. The H o n .
Sec. is a l s o returning officer for a l l the num-
erous elections that the Union has - this
runs from the relatively simple job when o n -
ly one candidate stands, to running sabbat-
i c a l elections (complete with ballot boxes)
and any referenda that crop up, the H o n . S e c
has to administrate them a l l and make sure
a l l is fairplay.
Insurance is also my brief - this includes
the college residence insurance policy and
various p o l i c i e s the Union h o l d s . It also
looks as though club insurance w i l l come
under the H o n . Sec. wing before long.
Minute taking is also my responsibility.
work, as he mixes many concerts for Radio
3, including the Proms. A s this event is
likely to be popular, only Radio Society mem
-bers w i l l be guaranteed seats. The rest of
you are very welcome, but latecomers may
have to stand if we get too crowded. (You
can always join, and save yourself the
trouble!). A g a i n , keep an eye on "What's On
for details.
A very important event in our calendar
is the A R R L D X contest, on the 3rd and 4th
of March. L a s t time we entered, we were
placed 2nd in Britain, so our hopes are high
for a similarly good result. Although only
licensed members can operate the transmit-
ter, we can use as much help as we can get
in keeping logs, checking for duplicate con-
tacts, making coffee, etc. If you've ever had
a passing interest in amateur radio, this is
your chance to see it in action at its most
e x c i t i n g .
And for the rest of you semi-interested
In practice I'm secretary to three committe-
es and i n theory five -you get so used to
taking minutes that any committee you att-
end y o u ' l l automatically think about taking
minutes whether you're meant to or not.
In common with the D . P . and P r e s . , y o u '
re also ex-officio on a l l union committees -
and that means a lot.
Well thafs the backbone of the job - there'
s also a lot of other smaller duties e.g. con-
trol of the Union parking spaces, upkeep of
all stationery.-Basically, i t ' s an a d m i n i s -
trative job, but there are moments of fun
spent cavorting naked around the U n i o n offi
office, in games of w i l d abandon, when a l l
normal inhibitions are thrown away.
Iranian notices
To finish off with - w i l l a l l those concern-
ed with putting up the Iranium notices arourd
college please note publicity rules, " t h e
date of the event being p u b l i c i s e d and the
name of the body organising it shall be w r i -
tten in E n g l i s h on a l l p u b l i c i t y . " I keep
finding posters in direct contravention of
this and I a m empowered to take them down
unless the TWes are complied with.
That's a l l for this week f o l k s .

persons, how about coming up to the shack
(roof of E l e c . Eng.) one Wednesday after-
noon, and finding out what its all about (no
obligation!). The club is, after a l l , back in
full swing with both rigs working, a l l aeri-
als up, and fresh Q S L ' s in the draw. And if
you don't know what a Q S L is, it's a post-
card-like object that takes F E L I X close to
a year to print. But it was worth the wait;
they're a real work of art (thanks, John!)
Oh, one other piece of news: We've been
thinking of changing our name to " I . C . Ama-
