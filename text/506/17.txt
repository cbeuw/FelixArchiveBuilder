T h e Role of the Student Counsellor
Whenever I'm asked to write a piece or give a talk about my job
I'm aware of a certain inner resistance, I suppose this might be
attributed in part to a natural streak of idleness, but I don't think
that's the whole story, and at least two other possible reasons
spring to mind.
One is that it is dangerously easy to sound pretentious. It's
an odd feature of my sort of work that is not susceptible of object-
ive assessment, and what the individual student, or the Col lege,
itself as employer may regard as a useful interaction or a s a t i s -
factory performance, may appear remarkably non-concrete when
honestly described in writing. Partly because of this, and no doubt
feeling a powerful urge to vindicate themselves, counsellors some-
times present evidence of their effectiveness which seems to me
highly questionable, not to say grandjose.
The other reason is that while I myself find the work endlessly
stimulating and rewarding, I think it unrealistic to assume that the
world at large w i l l share this view - "Student C o u n s e l l o r " does
not resonate as the p o s s i b l e title qf a T . V . drama s e r i e s . Of course
there is another side to this particular c o i n . Students themselves,
and sometimes their teachers, may have powerful reasons of their
own for not w i s h i n g to know about College support services, and
perhaps especially about the student counsellor who is inevitably
associated in people's minds, one way or another, with academic
or personal inadequacy, or both. T h i s grossly distorted and sim-
p l i s t i c fantasy of what a counsellor's work actually entails has its
roots firmly embedded in the prevailing ethic of the University world,
which ascribes the highest value to intellectual competence, and
which at this particular institution is sharply reinforced by male-
dominance. It is I think quite difficult for a student here to acknow-
ledge that he needs help, that he is vulnerable.
What then is counselling? It is a professional helping relationship
in which the aim is to put the student/client into a position where
he can cope with his own difficulties more effectively. It involves
a recognition of the integrity and uniqueness of the individual and
of his need to make his own contract with the world. C o u n s e l l i n g
and paternalism are entirely incompatable, and while almost a l l
counselling relationships involve an element of support and friend-
liness, they a l s o involve a degree of honesty which can be quite
demanding, and which marks them off from informal chat with friends
and colleagues.
What is so s p e c i a l about student's personal problems that justifies
a C o l l e g e in paying a professional helper? After all University en-
trants can hardly be perceived, except in the most trivial sense, as
a deprived group. Indeed in psychological and emotional terms they
are likely to be far healthier than the population at large. I have no
doubt at a l l that if we made a random survey of passers-by in the
High Street we would find amongst them a far higher proportion of
serious s o c i a l disability and of profound personal and emotional
problems than we would find in any University population.
In my opinion the answer lies in the c r i t i c a l combination of two
factors, namely the age-range of students, and the peculiar quality
of academic endeavour. The student age-range largely coincides
with a phase of rapid personal and emotional change and develop-
ment accompanied often enough by periods of anxiety and transitory
distress. Academic work, with inbuilt time limitations, by common
consent increasingly intense and competitive and demanding a s u s -
tained high level of intellectual efficiency, is peculiarly susceptabe
to the destructive impact of anxiety and other kinds of psychological
disturbance. A young man or woman, for example, coping with the
very normal repercussions of a broken love affair may - if he or she
is a bank clerk or a shop assistant - be able to work with relatively
little loss of efficiency. Such a life event for a student can have
quite damagingconsequences.A few weeks of distress, of impaired
ability to concentrate, may make a disastrous impact on a whole
year's work - especially perhaps in sequential courses inseparable
from science and technology. Anxiety and serious emotional .conflict,
whatever its source, almost invariably brings with it a marked fa 11-
ioff in work efficency for the university student - indeed that is the
Jnormal consequence of such experiences.
I wouldn't w i s h to overdramatise things. I know very well that we
all have to accept quite serious problems from time to time as part
â€¢ of the fabric of our lives, and we ride them out one way or another
without recourse to support s e r v i c e s . But the point needs to be
firmly made that everyone's self sufficiency is finite, and recogni-
sing that one has fallen, at least temporarily, below the threshold is
an index of maturity not of immaturity. Of course sharing worries
with friends, family or teachers may be a l l that is needed, but if
you wish to see someone outside your Department in complete
confidence, who is easily a c c e s s i b l e , and who has time to talk,
you are welcome to contact me. If it's any comfort to you 1 w i l l
almost certainly have come across something of the kind before!
My office is at 14 Princes Gardens, and you can call on spec,
or ring me on Internal 4205.
