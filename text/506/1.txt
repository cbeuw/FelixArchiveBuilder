BOYCOTT TO CONTINUE
The Union is to organise a 24 hour boycott of South side Refec-
tory in protest against poor quality food and high prices.
The decision by Tuesday's Union Meeting reverses the recommen-
dation of IC Union Executive to postpone the boycott.
Barry A u s t i n proposing the boycott s a i d that the abandoning of a
2 per cent price rise at the beginning of the year w a s not sufficient.
There w a s far deeper dissatisfaction among students about the re-
fectory service a n d a 24 •hour boycott would express students' feel -
ings. Refectories at other colleges were more s u b s i d i s e d than ours
and even some l o c a l restaurants were cheaper.

Students are being misled over the use of the regulator to tie re-
fectory prices to inflation and price rises are too high, according to
IC Union President Mary Attenborough .Former President Hugh Barr-
ett also feels that students have been led astray.
The regulator is the means by which refectory prices go up when-
ever there is a rise in the F i n a n c i a l Times Grocery Index. It w a s
set up in 1976 to allow increased costs of b a s i c foodstuffs to be
passed on to the customer without d e l a y . The F T Grocery Index in -
creased by 1.9 p e r c e n t in November and 1.4 p e r c e n t in December
resulting in refectory price rises of the same percentages on ^st
December and 8th January. contd. on back page

Cadmium Findings
Research carried out in I C ' s
geology department caused front
page news last weekend when
1,200 villagers of Shipham in
Somerset were told that the high
level of cadmium i n their soil
could be a health hazard.
The research project l e d by
Professor J . S . Webb surveyed 21
metals i n the s o i l of England and
Wales. In August last year the
researchers informed the Depart-
ment of the Environment that the
village of Shipham had l e v e l s of
cadmium in the s o i l of 100, and
in some p l a c e s 1,000, times the
national average.
