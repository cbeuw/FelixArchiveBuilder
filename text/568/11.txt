Puzzle Corner W h a t ' s o n
BigD
I am in receipt of letters from the Overseas Stu-
dents and the African-Caribbean Society Commit-
tee. Their contents have been noted.
Like many readers, I have enjoyed my heated
exchanges with Mr Afolabi in FELIX, but alas, it
must now come to an end. I would like to thank Mr
Afolabi for providing such interesting reading over
the past weeks — if only there were more of his
sort around this world would be a happier place.
To close, I would like to extend the warm hand
of friendship to Mr Afolabi and all of his happy
band of friends. Down with racial prejudice, I say1
,
stamp it out! As for women having tits; Good God,
Sir, that's downright sexism!
See you around, Desmond baby!
Twat of the Week
Big-mouthed Ben Bourdillon (Monster) of Guilds
hit squad fame, was recently paid to custard pie
me. However, I was pleased to see that I have
retained just a little anonimity as he hit the chap
opposite me in the Bot Zoo tearoom. This chap
was not an IC student and was understandably
annoyed. When he protested he was told: "Don't
be childish, take it in the spirit of the thing — you
can put it in your editorial if you like". He couldn't,
so I did.
Security
You guessed it, nothing has happened. No, I tell
a lie, a notice has appeared on the Falmouth/
Tizard door with the dodgy door-closer, saying
" N o Entry". Unfortunately, no one has
explained why, and, of course, everyone still
uses the door without pushing it closed behind
them. Still, enough about Southside, what about
Northside?
Very little has been said about Northside,
mainly because there have been few major
incidents. Well, last week, Weeks Hall could
have had a serious fire, so lets concentrate on
Northside. A consequence of the security
cutbacks is that Weeks, and the other
Northside buildings have no security guard on
duty on alternate nights. Besides laying open
Northside as easy picking for burgters, it poses
a serious fire-risk. This was highlighted this week
when a Weeks Hall resident, somewhat the
worse for alcohol, decided to cook a meal in the
middle of the night. After putting on his
spaghetti at 3:00am, he promptly fell asleep,
leaving the burning spaghetti to be discovered
by the Warden Dr Monro at 4:30am. By this
time the smoke had filled the hall, and infact the
the alarm was raised by Mrs Monro, who smelt
it on the ninth floor (the kitchen in question is
on the first!) If the chap had fancied chips, the
incident would have given FELIX a front page
story, not to mention The Times!

The orchestra committee were budgeting for their
next concert.
"The only instruments we may need to hire
players for are the piano, harp, harpsichord, tuba
and percussion," said the Chairman. "What are
the rates for hiring extra players?"
"Here's the current list," replied the secretary,
showing him this table.
£
Piano soloist 36
Orchestra pianist 30
Harpie 25
Tuba player 22
Harpsichordist 19
Percussionist 14
"And don't forget that apart from hiring extras,
we should allow £8 for printing programmes and
tickets."
The treasurer punched the buttons onhiscalcul-
ator. "With the-music we are playing at our next
concert," he said, "we shall need a total of exactly
£100 to cover hire of extras and printing."
What extra players will the orchestra be need-
ing?
Solutions, comments and criticisms to me c/o
FELIX Office. A prize of £2 and two tickets to the
IC Orchestra Concert for the first correct solution
opened at noon on Tuesday.
Last Week's Solution
Rumble started with Flirt before Quirk started with
Flirt before Prong started with Fluff. Prong and
Rumble are pure mathematicians. Quirk is a sta-
tistician (true, false, true).
There were sixteen replies (twelve of them cor-
rect) to a puzzle which most people felt was about
the right standard. Tim Lawes, Maths 3, won
(again) and he can collect his prize from the office.
Some people came unstuck by the unjustified
assumption that the mathematicians comprised
(compromised?) one pure, one applied and one
stats. Other people were confused by Prong's
second statement; this is worth a little explanation.
"If X then Y " means that either X is true, in,
which case Y is also true, orX is false in which case
we can say nothing about Y. A little thought shall
convince you that this is the same as saying X is
false or Y is true (or both). So we can write the
truth table:
X Y If X then Y
True True True
True False False
False True True
False False True
So if the statement "If X then Y" is true, either X
is false or Y is true or both. On the other hand, if "If
X then Y" is false, then X is true and Y is false.
I hope this makes things a little clearer!
IC Orchestra have sent me two tickets to their
concert next Thursday to add to the cash prize for
this week's competition. The wording of the puzzle
is to give them further publicity, and to thank them
for their generosity.
PS: Noon is twelve o'clock!
Had there been a security guard on that night,
he could have either prevented it happening, or, in
the case of fire, have cleared the building and
called the fire brigade.
I believe that the fire risk alone justifies 24
hour security in student accomodation.
Thought for the week
Afro-Carib Soc are having a party on Sat, Nov
22 — tickets £1, ladies free. This is either
discrimination or sexism. I rest my case.
Thanks to
Caroline, Mark, Patrick, Paul, Paleb, Steve,
Colin for the centre spread, Phil (2), Shanne,
Dave, Andy, and Suzi Pek for the pint.
