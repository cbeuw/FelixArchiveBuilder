He added that, " Imperial Col-
lege should be a more serious
Union and not dabble in mas-
cots." Dave Bishop, president of
Guilds, seconded the motion.
MR. ANAND'S TROUSERS
There was little opposition-
Uppi Anand, Chairman of SCC,
suggested that Mr. Kearns should
at the same time give away the
Mines' mascot. The Deputy
President, Barry Mair, retorted,
"If Mr. Anand is to be so
generous . . . he should also give
awav his trousers."
When the uproar had lulled,
Mr. Price gave his considered
opinion—" A very fair amend-
ment but it interferes with per-
sonal freedom."
A number of problems will
have to be ironed out before the
Tower fully adopts its new status.
One, as Kish Sadhvani, President
of RCS, mentioned, is the matter
of mascot bearers. Perhaps that
egghead of-Victoriana, Mr. John
Betjeman, can help.
SCHOLARSHIPS TO
HONG KONG
A more important item on the
agenda was Mr. Mair's proposal
that collections be made to pro-
vide two £50 scholarships spon-
sored by the World University
Service for Chinese students to go
to Hong Kong University.
Frank Fuchs, well-known
Communist, and John Tutelman,
well-known Jew, wished that our
gift have the official recognition
of the British High Commissioner
in Hong Kong- Their amend-
ment was defeated—there is no
High Commissioner!
Concern was also expressed re-
garding any political aspects of
WUS and on the methods of rais-
ing the £100. Mr. Mair assured
the audience of WUS's non-affil-
iation and Mr. Price had made
certain that the money would not
be used to cover administrative
costs, adding, " If the cause is
worth supporting then you will
support it personally." He de-
clared the motion " carried abso-
lutely overwhelmingly."
H U N T TO COUNCIL
Dave Hunt, Felix Sports Edi-
tor, defeated Keith Cavanagh, the
notable left-winger, to become
an RCS representative on Council
by 185 votes to 151. Pete Jones,
of Physics 2, was unopposed for
the vacancy on the Entertain-
ments Committee.
No nominations had been put
forward for Carnival Organiser,
so possible charities were not dis-
cussed. Council's decision to
extend Union bar licensing hours
was welcomed ; but criticism was
levelled at Council for the lack of
advertising for the Meeting.
L I T T L E BOXES
Dr. Weale, the Treasurer, be-
wildered the congregation with
his summary of the Union's
financial situation. Showing a
profit for last year, his report was
accepted, and his work appre-
ciated.
The Secretary, Barry Utting,
announced that a team had been
formed by Bill MacAuley, last
year's editor of Phoenix, to com-
pete in ITV's University Chal-
lenge in Manchester on 12th
November. But even his mono-
tone was forced to break in face
of titterings to his explanation of
how a lot of little Oxfam boxes
had disintegrated in transit.

CONTRACEPTION
The audience, however, were more convinced by Dr. Mears'
contention that the present population explosion has been caused by
man as a result of medical advance. In the Western world this has
been a slow process over a century and the new pattern of life, with
smaller families and longer life has been gradually introduced.
In the underdeveloped countries, Adrian Fletcher, then created a
where until very recently the
death rate has been high, medi-
cine has been thrust upon the
populace. Their death rate has
London smog, out of which the
latter emerged with a three-point
plan. This called for improved
food production, contraception,
been dramatically reduced, but and space research
the birth rate has not been
affected. The meeting affirmed
that this man-made problem must
be treated in another man-made
manner.
A LONDON SMOG
After Clerald Mulholland,
President of U L U Debates, and
Maurice English, Chairman of
Norman Price's level-headed
comment that " For a thing to be
a solution, it doesn't have to be
the only solution—it has to be the
best one" was a welcome relief
after such rubbish thrown from
the Concert Hall stage as Mr.
Mulholland's statement that he
did not believe in predictions
the National Schools Debating (when they were offered by the
Competition, had succeeded in other side) and later using one to
casting a haze over the whole further his own case,

BAR
On Monday (9th) night the new
Bar closing hours were christened
by the sale of only one orange
juice! Tuesday was not much
better—the students do not seem
to be so enthusiastic after all.
The sad side of the affair is the
treatment the barmen have re-
ceived. The first Howard, the
Union Barman, heard of the
changes was from the students
after the Union meeting. When
he went to Mr. Seaford to enquire
about this, he was handed a letter
which simply restated that the
barmen had always been expected
to work until 11 every night at
the discretion of the duty officer.
—now the bar would be kept open
regardless.
Although, in this letter, sym-
pathy was registered at the hard-
ship involved and they were
awarded an increase in pay, this
is disgraceful treatment of men
who have the interests of the
students at heart. The only reason
Howard has not left (which he has
threatened to do many times) is
because he knows that the college
will not be able to find another
barman, and because he genuinely
enjoys working for us. However,
he is an old man, and this might
be pushing things too far.
By law, barmen are supposed
to have 1J days off each week; but
ours only get one day oif a fort-
night. In the light of this, there-
fore, it is unfortunate that the
changes have been implemented
so heavy-handedly, for they are
people we simply cannot afford
to lose.
As a postscript, it is sad that we
have lost Jim from Southside; no-
body ever seems to stay there very
long.
