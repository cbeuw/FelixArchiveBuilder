The trouble is that we students
live in a world of " Christian
societies run by Christians for
Christians "; and I mean that as
a generalised criticism not of the
societies themselves but of the
way that we make use of them.
You probably belong to two or
three societies in which you really
feel at home (if you don't then
you're a brown-bagger extra-
ordinary !) But it's equally prob-
able that you've never gone to the
trouble of taking a look at the
other societies, the ones that don't
have any " instant appeal." You
will have grown used to being in
a majority, and no doubt you en-
joy evenings of mutual back-
slapping. But admit it, you don't
really gain anything from this
sort of gathering except maybe a
larger size in hats- So what I'm
suggesting is that you try stick-
ing your neck out, try broaden-
ing your horizons and being in
the minority for a change.
" But you haven't even men-
tioned the Buddhist Culture
Society yet."
Well I will now—because
heres one society where you cer-'
tainly would find yourself in a
minority. And I believe that
here you'd learn a lot too, per-
on the Buddhist
Culture Society
haps more than you imagine.
You've been brought up in the
Western way of life and you are
used to Western religions. You
know what prayer is, and you
will have made up your own
mind as to its worth. But how
about meditation ? Have you
ever considered its purpose or
reckoned its value ? And what
about reincarnation ? Have you
examined its feasibility or its im-
plications ? The chances are the
answers are no, because you've
never had the opportunity to
learn about Eastern religions
first hand. Or, to be more accu-
rate, you've never taken the op-
portunities presented to you.
The Buddhist Culture offers
you those very opportunities. So
why not stop being a self-satisfied
Christian, agnostic or whatever
just for one evening, and give
your stable world a jolt. It can't
do you anything but good !
Societies like the Buddhist Cul-
ture Society are essential to the
welfare of I.C. as a college of uni-
versity status. They need outside
support, all of them ; and the
Buddhist Culture Society de-
serves support too—yours per-
haps?

IRE DREAMER AWAKES
The average engineer is a

This was one of Professor
Buchanan's conclusions in his

The second in a series af articles by D. G. Bishop examining
various aspects of student life at Imperial College.
My previous article showed how the staff could help students
by improving the tutorial system- This continuation is to show how
students could help themselves . . . the other side of the coin. How
many students neglect to attend tutorials . . . and why ? How many
ignore the various discussions and external lectures organised by
their departments ?
Many people, both staff and students, have given up organising
special activities, merely due to continued lack of support. This can
arise due to either an unwanted activity, or an unwanted, unsuitable
organiser. For many, the change from school to college lies in a
change from taking all from the plate offered to selecting from the
plate offered. So few will work to put goodies back on the plate.
zone is the age-old age-barrier
the more senior members of staff
must cross in order to make con-
tact, and be " accepted." Many
younger members of staff find no
difficulty getting through, and
these people are the obvious
choice for tutors for the tutorial
classes outlined in the previous
article. Many of the staff are
willing to accept this, and some
departments are already imple-
menting the system (not because
of my article, but in spite of it!).
Now all remains with the stu-
dent. He must make the vital
first step. Do something. Call
the tutor a liar, and explain why.
Argue back. Develop ideals.
Jump up and down- Swear
vividly. Only in this way can
you help yourself develop.

In the Union, do something.
Get with people. Join a Society.
Explain your ideas. Help others
to help yourself. Write to Felix

ments.

support, your time, your experi-
ence, your interest, your en-
couragement, yourself. Make

STUDENT ORGANISATIONS
Smoothly run operations such
as Morphy Day this year do not
come by chance. Many hours of
thinking, planning, and physical
work by the three Vice-Presidents
of the constituent colleges,
eagerly aided by a band of will-
ing helpers led to a Morphy Day
that was enjoyed by all.who par-
ticipated. The Police were most
helpful, having been informed
earlier in the week of the coming
festivities. In fact the resident
policeman, who accompanied the
party home, was " impressed " by
the "Zebra Crossing," which in-
convenienced the public far less
than if Royalty had crossed the
Putney Bridge. (Contrary to the
objection of A . N . Other.)
And the organizers of all stu-
dent functions are just ordinary
students, no different from the
other 2,900 students . . . except
that they are keen to do things,
willingly, for the benefit of others,
sometimes at their own incon-
venience.
THE BUSY BODIES
Just as some sincere students
organise activities that are
failures, so do staff organise
events that fail from lack of sup-
port. It is important to note that
there is no sudden step between
staff and students, because, for
example, Bob Schrotcr, last year's
President of Guilds, is now a
member of Staff, and there is a
continuous line joining the
youngest fresher to the most
senior member of staff.
As always, problems arise be-
cause of the oddities in the sys-
tem . . • the man who pushes;
the member of staff who " ad-
vises " students how they should
behave within a freshers' dinner,
within the Union building; the
student who forces issues at
Council, or in a Union meeting,
or in Felix, and it is people like
this who thwart what both staff
and Union are trying to do.
Both braanches are aiming at
making life more enjoyable for
the students. Work and play are
each enjoyable in their respective
ways. It is reasonable to expect
the staff to make the academic
process as interesting as possible ;
the Union must aim at the best
socially for the students.
THE BOUNDARY ZONE
The boundary zone is, as
always, the problem area. One
