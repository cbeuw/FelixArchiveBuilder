The R.A.F. is not only one of the most efficient and most complex
organisations in the country, it is also one of the largest and most
up-to-date. The R.A.F. offers great scope to graduates of all
faculties: the command, direction, long-term planning and
overall administration of the Service demands trained minds,
imagination, and outstanding^ability. This is why the R.A.F.
goes to such pains to attract Graduates, to offer them specially
favourable terms of entry, back-dated seniority, and so on.

Excellent. All the top jobs in the R.A.F. are filled from within the
organisation. Make no mistake, it is men like you who will be the
Air Marshals of the 1990's.

Three of the attractions of an R.A.F. career are variety, responsi-
bility and a real sense of purpose. You don't go on year after year
doing the same job. You assume considerable responsibility at an
early age. You play a part in international as well as national
affairs, and contribute to peace and security throughout the world.

Yes indeed. Travel is part and parcel of R.A.F. life. You can
expect to live abroad some of the time, and get to know foreign
countries as no tourist ever could.

SNORKELS AND SORE EARS
Saturday, 7th November, saw
six freshers venture into Stoney
Cove, a disused granite quarry,
for their first snorkel dive. Depths
of 20 feet were within reach of
some, but only sore ears for
others. Then followed their first
dive with an aqualung.
It was I.C. Underwater Club's
first visit of the session to the
British Sub-Aqua Club's national
diving site in Leicestershire.
As night fell, preparations be-
gan for the experienced men to
venture into deeper water. Armed
with a powerful underwater
lamp, four divers reached a depth
of 70 feet with only the light of
the lamp to guide them.
Fog delayed the start of Sun-
day's dive but did not prevent the
enthuiastic divers from complet-
ing their snorkeling requirements.
DOLLIS HILL
The Maths and Physics Soc.
descended on an unsuspecting
Dollis Hill G.P.O. Research
Station. Here they were shown
new telecommunications tech-
niques involving transistors and
ferrite curves in computers. Tap-
soc seems unheard of.
New methods of postal sorting
were shown—surely not worth
another Id. a letter ? Then fol-
lowed a film on submarines
(why ?) and another on satellites-
A question-and-answer with a
Goonhilly Down expert finished
the visit.

NOVEMBER 5th
On November 5th the Harling-
ton Hop passed in a mass of
smoke and blue touchpapers,
giving what must be the best
value for money of all I.C. func-
tions- The highlight of the even-
ing was a horizontal rocket, by
courtesy of Chem. Eng. attack-
ing the attendant car of the blue
gentlemen. The hot dogs were
excellent sausage rolls, and the
beer (standard Harlington grot)
consumed from paper cups (. . .
ughh !) One thing is plain—mid-
week entertainment is always
welcome.

RCA have been using IC as a

FILM SOC
The Sweet Life
On 20th November, " La Dolce
Vita," Fellini's attack on Roman
corruption and decadence, will
get wide-screen showing in Phy-
sics Lecture Theatre 1.
Discarding the more conven-
tional idea of plot, Fellini takes
his hero Marcello, played by
Marcello Mastroianni, aptly a
gossip columnist, and plunges
him into the turbulance of the
new Bohemia. By describing
Marcello at work, Fellini is able
to give us a panorama of those
who lead " the easy life." Also
starring are Anouk Aimee, Anita
Ekberg, and Yvonne Furneaux.
On 27th November in our
Special Season we will be showing
" The Vikings," a spectacular
story of Norse warriors starring
Kirk Douglas and Tony Curtis.
EXPLORATION SOC
S u r v i v a l
Two shipwrecks and five air
crashes, spending 18 weeks after
one crash making his way back
to civilisation from the Australian
desert, should be recommenda-
tion enough for Captain Keith
Douglas Young's expertise on
survival.
He is flying over from Germany
to talk on this subject at 5.45 on
24th November in Physics Lec-
ture Theatre 3.
Initially a stunt pilot, he be-
came a professional buffalo
hunter and crocodile shooter in
Australia. After leading an ex-
pedition to the interior of New
Guinea, he joined the U.S.A.F.
and has since been in charge of
several Survival and Unarmed
Combat training schools, at
present at Ramstein Air Base.
STAFF - STUDENT R E L A -
TIONSHIPS — an answer to
David Bishop. The five depart-
mental heads and the Dean of
City and Guilds are to meet the
Guilds' Union Executive on 14th
December to air their views on the
subject.
