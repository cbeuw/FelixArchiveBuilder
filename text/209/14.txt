Hockey : U.L. Cup
l.C. ROMP THROUGH
I.C. 8—0 Westminster Hospital
On November 4th, the I.C.
Hockey team gained a convincing
win in the first round of the U.L.
Cup, beating Westminster Hospi-
tal by 8 goals to nil on their home
ground at Cobham. Although for
the past two years, the first round
cup matches have been lost, the
team showed no sign of nerves,
and were soon on the attack; for
after only two minutes play, I.C.
were one up through an individual
goal by right winger Stenning,
who put in a fine shot from a very
narrow angle.
From that moment on, the
team attacked continually. Goals
followed at frequent intervals,
and half time came with I.C. four
up from Anketell, Koerner, and
left back K. Peters.
After the interval the relentless
pressure on. the Hospital's defence
was continued, and two excellent
short corner goals by Phillips
made the I.C. position impreg-
nable.
In the last quarter of an hour,
outside left Koerner scored his
second goal of the day, which was
followed just before full time by
a goal from E. Castell, who
scored from one of the many
short corners.
Throughout the match the I.C.
defence was scarcely troubled:
indeed when the final whistle
blew, goalkeeper E. Needham
was still awaiting a chance to
demonstrate his full capabilities.
Luckily he was never tested. I.C.
therefore enter the second round
full of confidence, for it is the
first time since 1960 (when I.C.
last won the cup), that this col-
lege really stands a good chance
of winning this competition.

IN TOUCH
Centre' 6
5 ?
AT LAST. The Sports Centre of Prim.es Gardens is no longer a
nebulous collection of matter (highly charged at that) hovering very
unstably over the corridors of Westminster, or wherever the University
Grants Committee sits. The cloud has now congealed but unfortu-
nately drifted, still further up the exponential time curve.
General plans were accepted in September of this year and more
detailed plans have been submitted for approval. After some lightning
work by the U.G.C., building could possibly start in the Autumn of
1965.
For those who don't know, the Sports Centre (an idea first mooted
in 1957) is to be built on the North-West corner of Princes Gardens
and will consist of a swimming pool, rifle range, four squash courts and
various offices and changing rooms.
Since early in 1961, when plans were formally submitted by the
College, progress has been painstakingly slow, being a subject of
amusement to all and sundry, (and a useful standby for Council with
nothing else to talk about).
Naturally, most people blame the U.G.C. for the delay but the
College and the Union must accept some of the guilt.
Contact between the Development Section of the College and the
Union has not been of a very high standard; for instance, the dimen-
sions of the pool were changed six times from 1961-1963, last year
the Union had to make extensive enquiries to find out where the
project itself had gone.
A basic difficulty is that Union Officers are elected yearly, whereas
Admin, staff are more permanent. Union Officers don't start thinking
about problems until they are faced with them, and consequently are
always one or more steps behind.
We must attempt to make the Union a more professional-like
body with officers suitably briefed and knowing in advance what they
are going to do about specific problems.
But now meet
" giant-killers,"
CE.M in next round.

I.C. 1—2 L.S.E.
From a Roving Reporter
L.S.E. started the game going
straight into attack, and coming
close to scoring with a header
from close range. I.C. quickly
hit back when first Crisp and then
Bentham shot narrowly wide. It
was against the run of the play
when L.S.E. scored; a cross from
the right was half cleared and
then slack marking from the I.C.
defence, resulted in the inside
forward shooting into the corner
of the net.
I.C. then began to produce
some really excellent football,
and particularly pleasing at this
stage was the fluent work of
Eastell and Crisp, whose quick
changing of position gave the
L.S.E. defence much to worry
about.
I.C. equalised when a move,
developed by Hunt and Batcup,
culminated in Kemp's centering
for Bentham to shoot into the
roof of the net.
After the interval I.C. gained
complete control but were often
at a loss in dealing with a retreat-
ing defence which L.S.E. were
operating extremely efficiently.
L.S.E.'s second goal was a
complete surprise to the I.C. de-
fence, a long ball down the middle
found L.S.E.'s centre forward
who headed a splendid goal.
With Eastell going off with an
ankle injury I.C. lost their grip
on the game, although Price
showed great enthusiasm in an
effort to equalise. The I.C. rear-
guard seemed shaky in the closing
stages, when L.S.E. were pressing
for a further goal.

Sailing
The second team scored a con-
vincing win over Northampton
College first team on November
7th, winning both races. The
racing provided interest and
amusement to spectators, who
witnessed only three out of six
boats managing to finish in each
race. J. Birchall did well to cap-
size and still finish first in one of
the races.
The following Sunday morning,
the College took first place in
both the London University
points races, J. Birchall winning
" B " points and S. Vines, " A , "
finishing ahead of D. Pentz who
had to be content with a second.

The Judo Club, I.C.'s most
successful sporting organisation
last year, seem to be in an even
stronger position this year. Al-
though rather overcrowded in the
gymnasium, membership of the
club is still increasing. Victories
were recorded earlier this term
over Oxford University (5^-2^),
and Ealing Technical College
(2^-i), and amongst the newcom-
ers to the team, Krikor and Sund-
erland are the most improved.
More Wins
Wednesday November 14th saw
the start of inter-college Judo in
London. I.C. made an impres-
sive start and are now heading
the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 5th leagues,
a notable victory being that of the
6th team, which is composed en-
tirely of new members.
Southampton Thrashed
On Saturday, November 7th a
team went to Southampton and
recorded a 6-1 win. This was
achieved in spite of the fact that
two of I.C.'s foremost players did
not participate. Nevertheless I.C.
produced some good Judo with
Prescott, Cohen, and Drury out-
standing.
•After the match, I.C.'s superi-
ority was demonstrated when
their two brown belts each beat
a line-up which consisted of the
whole Southampton Club.
