Burmese Evening
Dear Sir,
The account of the Burmese Evening by your reporter in the
Late News sheet was most misguided. Did he seriously think the
show was to be a Broadway production! Was he not aware that:
(1) All twenty-six performers who took part were amateurs, perform-
ing free.
(2) Rehearsals could not be carried out as most of the performers live
a considerable distance away from London, so were unfamiliar with
stage layout.
(3) Only one quarter of the available space on the stage could be used,
as the rest of it was filled with the Dram. Soc's stage props for their
forthcoming show, piano, chairs etc. etc.
Your reporter seems to have a very knowlegeable idea of stage
management—so if we have another show of this sort, maybe he will be
willing to stage manage it for us\
Regarding the food, all I can say is that although we provided
it, it was not prepared by us.
Yours faithfully,

Another
Viewpoint
Dear Mr. Walker,
On behalf of the Britain-Burma
Society I sliould like to thank you
for the interest shown by "Felix"
in the recent Burmese Evening at
the college. I consider the write-
up in the Felix Late News to be
very fair—even the reference to
the " bumbling stage manage-
ment " which we regretfully admit
to be true.
Yours sincerely,
H. E. GOTO (Zoology)
(Joint Hon. Sec, Britain-Burma
Society)
Advertising
Dear Sir,
We were dismayed to learn of a
proposal by the Union hierarchy
to restrict advertising in the
Union (and later, in Southside)
to the extent of permitting only
10" by 8" posters, probably rolled
up and secreted in pigeonholes.
True, the Union is cluttered with
a large number of bad posters,
but surely most of these are con-
cerned with external affairs?
If they were removed the space
available for college advertising
would be doubled, and a system
of censorship could be set up to
weed out the scrappier internal
posters.
Our particular interest in this
affair arises from the problem of
advertising for the Folk Song
Club, which relies on catching the
attention of non-members (regular
attendance 120, members only 50
at beginning of term). How can
we advertise people like Bill
Clifton and Ian Campbell on
toilet-paper?
We suggest that there is ample
room for well-designed 15" by 12"
displays, provided they are al-
lowed to be put up for a limited
period, say, 7 days. There are
many posters that have remained
on tlie board since the beginning
of term.
Yours, in anger,

APOLOGY
We regret certain errors in the
reporting of the Burmese Even-
ing in the last issue. In particu-
lar, a caption on page 9 indicat-
ing a gentleman to be Sir Hubert
Ranee, the last Governor of
Burma. He was, in fact, Mr.
John Pringle, a member of the
Britain-Burma Society. Sir
Hubert was at the last moment
unable to attend.
M i s l e a d i n g
Dear Sir,
The comment in your last Late
News sheet about bad attendance
in the debate with Kings was mis-
leading. At least half of the
people present left around 2.30
witliout voting (presumably to get
to the lectures). The attendance
was about 100. Whoever reported
the debate to you presumably did
not point this out; hence your un-
fortunate comment. Arrange-
ments are being made to allow
people to vote as they leave if
they wish to leave a debate before
it has finished.
Yours faithfully,
R. J. KIRK (Physics)
Morphy D
a
y
Dear Editor,
I went to my first Morphy Day
as a photographer, and thus had
ample opportunity to see what
was going on. It is traditionally
a day for a punch-up, and nobody
will complain at students letting
off their high spirits provided that
it does not affect anybody else.
But can there be any excuse for
the liold up of traffic produced
afterwards ? I think not. This is
no more nor less than gaining
one's pleasure at seeing others'
inconvenience—an utterly selfish
thing to do. Done once a year
or otherwise, there can be no
justification for this—Morphy
Day celebrations ought to be con-
fined to inter-student activities,
and not be at the expense of the
general public.
Yours sincerely,

TO T E A C H
IS TO CREATE
From the time of Socrates, teachers have made
at least as important a contribution to society's
progress as the statesmen, ihe inventors and
the artists. Their influence is now wider, their
responsibilities greater than ever before. Today
education offers a creative career of increasing
scope, in which people of ie'eas and initiative
can use their talents and attainments to the full.
Many exciting new things are happening in the
education service . . . things in which you might
take part. Ask for the new booklet, C.E.G.,
at your University Appointments Board, or from
