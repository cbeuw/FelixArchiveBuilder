Rugby : Gutteridge Cup Swimming
HIGH CUP HOPES
Free coaches leave the Union at 115 p.m.
To-day the I.C. rugby team
takes the field at Harlington to
commence its campaign to regain
the Gutteridge Cup. The oppo-
nents are Northern Polytechnic
who are rather an unknown
quantity as a rugby team, al-
though in the past seasons their
record hasn't been impressive.
They have no outstanding players
this year and have been finding it
impossible to field a team on
Wednesdays owing to the college
lecture timetable. Of the five
matches played, four have been
lost to unimpressive opponents
and Regent St. Polytechnic were
beaten 16-3. However I.C.'s de-
feat at the hands of an under-
estimated C.E.M. two years ago,
is ensuring caution in the home
camp.
The I.C. side has settled down
very well and is slowly being
welded into a powerful combina-
tion. The main feature of the
play so far has been the ability
of the backs to link up with the
forwards-
This has been achieved by one of the best back
rows seen at I.C. for several years. With this
ability to run the ball, coupled with a defence that
has only conceded 4 tries in 8 matches, I.C. should
defeat Northern Polytechnic today by quite a
large margin, with the prospect of getting very
near to Motspur Park to retrieve the Gutteridge
Cup-
On the right, H. D. Watson and
J. C. Tye ' figure' very promi-
nently in ffagins' games against
Rosslyn Park 'B,' ffagins won
35-0.
The probable team is :

P. Hammerton
A. Turton
M. Riley
D. Howell
A. Duke p. Metcalf
M. Davies
R. Weisner
L. Mills
C. Molam

Ffagins X V have improved on their poor start
to the season and have met with better success.
The record to date is—played 11, won 6, lost 4,
drawn 1: points for 249, against 85. However, it
seems to be a rule that the team does badly when
" guest stars " are playing. Last Sunday the team
included D. Thomas (D.T.s—Saracen's 2nd row
fotward) and P. Johnson (ex-U.L. centre) and lost
8-40 to a very strong Beckenham team.
Although the team is improving the backs are
prone to patches of bad handling. Marriage has
not slowed down Barber, who is still shoving well
in the tight. Hall is playing extremely well and has
made several determined runs scoring three or four
tries. Topliss continues to amaze with his handling
ability; he manages to run at full speed with his
body parallel to the ground.
As three recent victories have been gained with
a margin of over 30 points, the target for this year
is 500 points.
The Imperial College Women's
Sports Club is holding keep fit
classes in the gymnasium on
Monday evenings at 6.45 p.m.
One of the College's Australian
phenomena, A. Collins, is in
charge of the sessions, and all
ladies who dare are welcome.

The Imperial College Riding
Club has no r m l in the College.
It leaves ail i/he other clubs (ex-
cept perhaps The C & G Motor
Club, and even that is disput-
able) standing.
With a snort, a whinny, and a
great shortage of members, it
launches itself into the new year.
The only requirement for mem-
bership of the exclusive, who do
not wish to remain exclusive, is
the sum of five shillings.
Join us! Correct clothing is
not required, and beginners (and
everyone else, for that matter) are
welcomed. Riding is organised
(or disorganised ?) every Wednes-
day afternoon, and Saturday
riding can be arranged if there is
sufficient demand. We have rides
once or twice a term, and regu-
lar competitions with other col-
leges.
Riding is subsidised, and the
cost (after subsidy) is about 7/
per hour.
If you are interested in the
<?questrian cult, find out more
ibout it by contacting Richard
Carrington (president) or Derek
Barr (secretary) via the Union
Rack.
How bus (his article left you ?
Fed up? Exhilarated? Sickened?
Riding is very relaxing, and
may improve your state of mind.
Swimming not up to
'polo standard
I.C. 28—32 R.M.A Sandhurst
R.M.A. Sandhurst beat l.C. in
swimming 32-28 points, at the
Sandhurst pool. Sandhurst won
all the individual events with I.C.
swimmers coming second and
third except in the butterfly event.
Godfree (I.C.) won the butterfly
in fine style and Stapely was there
to clinch second place. Sandhurst
won both relays quite comfort-
ably. I.C.'s trouble is due to a
noticeable lack of good class
competition swimming this year;
starts and turns were bad and
swimmers seemed to lack the sta-
mina required to sprint the last
length.
The 'polo was a different story
and here the Army duly met its
Waterloo. Sandhurst opened the
battle with some long range
artillery which caught the I.C.
defence and goalkeeper Banyard
unawares, so that the Academy
were two goals up in the first
quarter. Hereafter, I.C. closed
its ranks and started to attack.
Davis and Ong brought I.C. level
at half time, but Sandhurst were
beginning to tire. Stapely play-
ing his best game for I.C. this
season, began to outswim the op-
position and scored three fine
goals. Inspired by Stapely's
efforts the rest of the I.C. team
soon had the bewildered Army
team outmanoeuvred Dapot
scored the final goal to make it
6-2 to I.C.

The cross-country club is now
rather smaller than last year, but
the number of Freshers who have
become keen members of the club
augurs well for the future. How-
ever, the increase in standard this
year more than makes up for the
reduced numbers.
The club has beaten Kings Col-
lege, R.M.A., Sandhurst, London
School of Economics, and Gold-
smith's College this term—all our
close rivals for some years.
Latest news is that a depleted
first team came 13th in the Wood-
bury Road Relay at Exeter (out
of some 30 teams). This is three
places higher, and three minutes
faster than last year's complete
first team.
