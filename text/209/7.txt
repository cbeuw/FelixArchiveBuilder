UNIVERSITY COLLEGE
THEFTS
It is estimated that £4 10s. Od.
is stolen daily from students at
University College. Furthermore
£240 worth of cutlery and £100
worth of glasses are stolen from
the refectory per term.
KEELE MEAL SCANDAL
Students at Keele have to pro-
duce identity cards, bearing their
photographs, in order to be
servedin their refectories.—Why?
—Because the Senate have de-
cided to enforce this measure to
prevent students committing the
heinous offence of eating in a hall
of residence other than their own.
CHELSEA FLOPS

pass rate of less than 50 per cent.

arc as follows: —
B.Sc. (gen.)—44 per cent; B.
Pharmacy—48 per cent; B.Sc.

THE VANISHING C JLLEGE
According to the N.U.S. hand-
book for London Students there
is no such place as I.C. It gives
a full and comprehensive list of
University Colleges, C.A.T's,
medical schools and other col-
leges but nowhere is there a men-
tion of I.C. It's like the U.S.A.
refusing, in theory, to admit the
existence of 600 million Chinese
because they aren't in the United
Nations.
PARAGUAYAN PROTEST
Paraguayan students are pro-
testing against entrance exams to
universities !
WATCH YOUR LANDLADY !
Two third-year students at
Manchester University^gave their
landlady an £18 retainer for the
summer vac- They returned this
term to find the home sold and
the new owner knowing nothing
of any agreement or money.
A MATTER OF MORALS
King's College have a " Moral
Guidance Officer," elected by
their Union Council. Do we
need one at I.C.?!
COMPLIMENT FOR I.C.
SOCIETY
"King's News" referred to I.C.
International Society as "excel-
lent and prosperous " in a report
on the recent Burmese evening
held at I.C.
Will if all seem worthwhile 5 years from now?
At Turner & Newall a man's degree — whether
in science, engineering or the arts — counts
for far more than a passport to a round of
interviews. Our Training Scheme is planned
to employ all his university attainments to
the full, and to be adaptable to his individual
needs.
J u s t w h o a r e T & N ? Turner & Newall is one
of the strongest, most important groups in
British industry. With a large and growing
stake in asbestos-cement, in insulation, in
brake linings and in plastics T & N is closely
linked to all four major areas of economic
growth. To the building industry; the motor
industry; the newer plastics; and to activity in
the developing territories of the Common-
wealth . . . all adding up to a strongly expand-
ing £100,000,000 business with 36,500
employees. Overseas, with 17 companies in
10 countries.T & N has doubled its interests in
ten years.
E a r l i e r R e s p o n s i b i l i t y T & N thus offers
outstanding graduates a career of great scope,
keyed from the first to areas in which expan-
sion is at its fastest. . . opportunity at its best.
Moreover, under our broad and flexible
training scheme, the graduate assumes
managerial responsibility more confidently —
and certainly earlier — than is often the case in
industry today.
N o t e t o R e s e a r c h M e n T & N also recruits
scientists end engineers direct into its re-
search and development branches, whose
projects are particularly closely linked to the
needs of the expanding industries. Opport-
unities for supervising work with a practical
application, as well as for fundamental study,
are thus outstandingly good.
