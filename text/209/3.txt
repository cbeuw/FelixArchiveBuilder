COUNCIL CARRIES
I.C. Union Council began sitting at 5.45, Tuesday, 3rd Novem-
ber. Six hours and many cigarettes later it was still sitting—and
talking, but by that time all but the stalwart orators had fallen into
a somnolent silence. Much of the time in between was spent in
arguing about trivialities, occasionally checked by the Chairman,
Mr. Price, and complaints from Mrs. Robb, whose exceptional
patience was stretched to its limits towards midnight.
Of the subjects of importance discussed, two were Council regu-
lars—College Bar hours and car parking facilities.
ANAND UNDER FIRE
The financial estimates of the
ACC and RCC were passed with-
out much quibbling but the SCC
had more trouble.
The methods by which the De-
bating Society obtained £50 for
debating lessons (badly needed !)
came under fire. Mr. Price ob-
jected to their seeking money
from General Studies, behind
Council's back. Mr. Anand re-
plied that, rather than risking
Council refusing his request, he
was forced to find the money
elsewhere. Much discussion en-
sued in which it was pointed out
that it was preferable to obtain
money from Council, rather than
any other body, as only in the
former case was the money stu-
dent controlled.
After a muddle with motions
and amendments, the following
was passed : that Societies should
not accept money from sources,
other than Council, unless under
special circumstances, to be de-
cided by the executive of the
SCC
SCHROTER DISAPPOINTS
A report by Mr. Schroter on
the Car Parking and Traffic Com-
mittee was thoroughly disap-
pointing. At the Council meet-
ing in February he had reported
that the Committee was looking
into the problem carefully. Eight
months and five committee meet-
ings later, all he could say was
that they were still looking into
it (still carefully, I suppose), but
that no positive action had been
taken. He then emphasised the
importance and urgency of park-
ing facilities being included, while
there were still building plans
being drawn up. The inactivity
was blamed on the Chairman of
the Committee, Mr. Stevenson,
and it was generally decided to
make him " pull his finger out"
with a representation by Mr.
Price-
CHEERS AND MOANS
The ever-increasing topic of
bar hours then arose and without
any trouble, a motion was
passed, allowing the College bars
to remain open until 11 p.m. on
week-days and 10.30 p.m. on
Sundays.
The proposition by the Execu-
tive that ordinary Council mem-
bers should take their turn in the
Union Offices at lunchtime, was
met with groans (not of fatigue
—yet) from those concerned, but
somehow the motion was passed.
REPORT BY
PETER COMBES
PASSING ON B L A M E
Then followed a very welcome
interval when everybody repaired
to the bar. The pints consumed
were not enough, unfortunately,
to liven the second half which be-
came decidedly tedious.
There was present the I.C.
Sennet agent, to whom a com-
plaint was made concerning the
inaccuracy of the reporting on
I.C. He smartly passed the
blame on the two I.C. men (one
a Fresher) who report for Sennet,
and no satisfactory conclusion
was reached.
INNOVATIONS
Council expressed concern over
midweek entertainments- Last
year's South Side Stomps had
shown that organised midweek
events were welcome. The even-
ing of October 29th had demand-
ed expert rearrangement to fit in
so many activities into the Union.
A committee will be set up to in-
vestigate planned midweek enter-
tainment.
This year's Union " blue book"
has turned up six weeks late. A
printer has offered to produce
this annually on the lines of the
U L U Handbook free of charge—
he would arrange the advertising
himself. Chris Tye is to investi-
gate.
At seven minutqs to twelve the
meeting drew wearily to a close,
rather from lack of stamina than
from any lack of trivialities to
discuss.
