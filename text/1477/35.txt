FRIDAY 10 decemBER 2010
The Best of 2010!
Reflection of this last year, has brought tears and smiles, but all
that really matters here, is the music that accompanies the ride.
Lovingly, we have conjured up the most exciting music to come
from this last year... Now wise up!
Moving away from his past eclectic and
ambient sound, Putney’s Four Tet mi-
grates towards a more electro branch
of IDM. This album encapsulates the
listener, it’s dreamy and understated,
slowly enveloping you more and more
with each successive listen. His ex-
ceptional Rounds may still herald his
absolute best work, but this is not far
behind at all.

Beach House have created an album
where you can take a few minutes out
of a day, listen to it, and forget about
everything in the world. It’s a collec-
tion of rippling sound pulses, dreamy
drones and the wonder of a truly unique
voice which has echoes of Velvet Un-
derground’s Nico. It is a musical haze of
suspended time, which takes you sonic
travelling into bright, positive music.

It was an anxious wait for Arcade Fire’s
third album. Anything less than fantas-
tic would have been a blemish on their
catalogue. The first time I heard The
Suburbs I wasn’t blown away, but with
more time to digest a better apprecia-
tion becomes evident. The sound is
less sprawling than Funeral and feels
more focussed towards stadiums than
Neon Bible.

Dan Snaith (Aka Caribou) is an Impe-
rial Alumnus, and no doubt his PhD
entitled Overconvergent Siegel Modu-
lar Symbols pschyed him up good and
proper to get some truly stellar music
unleashed on the world. Swim is writ-
ten about learning to do so, and the
music swirls, splashes, and ripples
with lush production, making this al-
bum one the years best aural delights.

Halcyon Digest is a real ‘grower’, an-
chored by Bradford Cox’s confident,
unique vocals, which unfurl in a drifting
and languorous fashion. Having moved
past the ‘ambient punk’ of previous al-
bums to more ‘60s influenced sounds,
they display their expanded musical
vocabulary in the album’s highlight
Coronado, proving that the band can
do joyous just as well as hazy.

No Age’s second album opens with
the slow-burning stunner Life Prowl-
er, and only gets better from there.
A ragged punk band that operate at
the point where noise becomes mel-
ody, they temper powerful rock (Fever
Dreaming) with piercing pop (Glitter)
and more ambient pieces (Dusted) to
give a rough diamond of album: one
that’s bruising and beautiful.

The laid back grooves and cut up sam-
ples of Bonobo are easy enough to
enjoy, but closer listening reveals a
depth of complexity. Jazzy melodies
fuse with hip hot beats, overlayed with
sweet female vocals. The mixture of
several genres make this a particu-
larly rewarding listen and is distinctly
contemporary.

Holy Fuck flirted with melody on their
previous album. On Latin they have
taken to that song’s approach, and
have made a fantastic album in the
process. Their music is still based
around the restless rhythms that de-
fined them, but here the songs pro-
gress and build, becoming more tune-
ful and potent as they race towards
their epic conclusions.

A concept album using the American
Civil War as an allegory for our modern
world’s troubles. Equal parts Spring-
steen stadium rock and Pogues-like
punk energy, full of infectious songs
like the ultimate whiskey-swiggin’ an-
them Theme From Cheers, the album is
a glorious success. Proof that rock isn’t
dead, and that there is still beauty to be
found in gritty vocals.

Costing a reported $3 million to
make – it’s stuffed with guest stars
and it’s seventy minutes long – yet it
leaps these hurdles effortlessly due
to West’s singular vision. His rapping
is at its peak, and the arrangements
are near flawless. It’s that rare type of
album – one so stuffed with highlights
that it demands to be consumed in a
single listen. A masterpiece.
