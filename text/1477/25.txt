COMMENT
A
fter a month at imperial,
my friends had found out
that I hadn’t ever touched
snow. Naturally I was
mildly teased as they
took amusement from my winter noob-
ness. As soon as the prospect of snow
arrived in the form of a little icon on
the BBC online weather forecast, I was
over the moon. Of course, I was expect-
ing to wake up to a snow day the next
day so when I went to lectures that day
I was rather excited. As soon as people
said “it won’t settle”, I just nodded and
toned down the outward enthusiasm.
One Google search later I realised that
meant it’ll be in the sky but not on the
ground. Sad face.
Skip to next Tuesday at 7:30AM I
receive a text saying, “SNOW!” My
obvious response to this is to immedi-
ately rip my covers off and, in one swift
movement, tear open the curtains while
launching myself toward the window
with enough force to have my face col-
lide with the glass. Potential facial bruis-
es aside, seeing the little white things
falling from the sky was astonishing.
I do not remember how long I stood

there but once I removed myself from
the fairytale, I frantically sent out a text
along the lines of “as soon as you are
awake enough to play in the snow with
me, text me!!!!” after that I leaped over
to my wardrobe to get changed. I soon
realised I wasn’t sure what to wear, but
then a flash memory of my mother’s
email reminding me to layer up prompt-
ed me to wear all of my uni qlo gear at
the same time, and then some. It took
me about 20 minutes to put on 5 lay-
ers made up of 21 items of clothing. I
then stuffed my pockets with any money
I could find, just in case being in the
snow brings on sudden expenses. Not
a minute later, I received a reply from
a friend from my old school (also very
obviously a snow virgin) informing me
that he and our other friend from before
were in Princes Gardens freaking their
shit over the snow. Eager to join them,
I hurled myself down the stairs with
enough force to stop a bus, and quickly
exited Beit.
Being outside in the snow was utterly
magical. In my head there are two kinds
of snow: snow from romantic comedies
and snow from action movies. I was of-
ficially in a rom-com. After the initial
shock of having cold small things touch
my cheeks, I was on my very merry way
to Prince’s Gardens. While walking I
wasn’t aware that I had an unnaturally
large smile attached to my face until
people started staring. Even after I real-
ised I looked like I had just snorted some
new class A drug, I was too giddy to care
and so carried on scaring the south ken
residents in a joker like fashion.
After meeting my friends, we just
stood in the snow; open mouthed try-
ing to catch it on our tongues. After that
failed, we settled for copious amounts of
prancing, leaping and other forms gen-
eral joyousness. This is when I realised
crunchy snow is like crunchy leaves on
steroids, and this is coming from some-
one who will go WELL out of her way
to step on a crunchy leaf. Naturally, this
made me unbelievably happy as every
step in the patch of snow gave a very
satisfying crunch. Although the snow
that day was minor, it was more than
good enough for me and I proceeded
with abnormally high spirits, a spring
in my step and the same freakish smile
plastered across my face.
T
he praise for Julian As-
sange certainly is interest-
ing to me. Not that I don’t
admire the man; it’s very
impressive what he’s done,
and many of the papers released are gen-
uinely hilarious to read. Mainly because
they paint a picture that confirms the
best and most accurate conspiracy of all
- that the world is not run by malicious
plotters or fascists or corporations, but
that it is run by people. Stupid, fallible,
normal people who just happen to be in
a seat of power rather than the front of
a taxi.
The leak was admirable because it
reminded me that, yes, the world is ac-
tually normal. People think the Royal
Family are crazy. China secretly slaps its
knees and laughs whenever Kim Jong Il
makes a weird speech to the world.
I guess I find the praise strange be-
cause Julian Assange isn’t really a free-
dom fighter this time around. He’s just a
petty and bitter man.
The war leaks seemed justified - I
watched the gunship footage with hor-
ror, and it felt good to know that this sort
of thing was able to be made public. But
releasing a memo that suggests the US
thought Brown was a bit ugly? It’s hard-
ly breaking news. It doesn’t help anyone
either. What Wikileaks has done is tanta-
Lisa Ashari
mount to reading STD test results out at
a brothel. The same people in the world
are getting fucked, you’re just making
everyone feel slightly more uncomfort-
able about it.
And of course, this pettiness and dedi-
cation to the word “secret” has drawn
out every government conspiracy ma-
niac this side of the JFK assassination.
There are people out there, people
who were created through roughly the
same biological process as you, me and
Gilead Amit, who believe that America
staged Pearl Harbour so they would
have a reason to invade Asia. These peo-
ple look at leaked documents about the
size of Ronald Reagan’s left testicle, and
they say “If they were hiding that, who
knows what else they could be hiding.”
It doesn’t help that Assange looks like
the offspring of Doc Brown from Back
to the Future and John Inman from Are
You Being Served. He gives off an im-
age of craziness, a slight zany fire in his
eyes that might make him appear to be
leaderly and messianic, but also gives
you that strange feeling that, at any sec-
ond, he might start trying to sell you or-
ganic coffee.
Backed up with real, factual, existing
documents, it’s a shitstorm for every
flavour of crazy out there. I can’t help
by admire him despite all this, though,
because what he’s done I didn’t think
was possible in the world today. Angry
people who hate “The West” like to
think that the secret service can simply
disappear people, erase companies and
households off the map, make it look
like an accident. But a man who looks
like he’d surrender to a car backfiring,
with all the special ops training of a Eu-
ropean computer nerd, has manager to
evade capture by just about everyone.
So here’s the value of what Assange
did; not the memos, which are tedi-
ous and predictable; not the diplomatic
tizzy everyone got into; simply, that he
showed just how incompetent the world
really is.
No-one is out to get you. No-one is
out to control you. They’d all like to,
but they’re just too thick. So sit back
and have a relaxing Christmas, knowing
full well that Big Brother is every bit as
childish and silly as the name implies.
Merry Christmas. Here’s to the Brave
New World.
Have you got any secret government
documents to reveal to the world?
Send them to anangrygeek@
gmail.com so I can achieve world-
wide fame... and then get arrested
on sex charges.
Our leaders are idiots... no shit

The nativity: from a
lady’s point of view
No business like snow business
Male chauvinists have assured
me that it is my job to care
about domestics. But to show
that I am not merely using this
as an excuse to slack off work
and am taking my responsi-
bilities as a female seriously, I
want to tell you about my role
model, Baboushka (aka Babs
in my book). One could think
of her as a Russian version of
St Nicholas. For those to whom
St Nicholas is a vague figure of
festive season relevance with a
day in his name, I ought to add
some explanations; it would
make a useful piece of trivia
wouldn’t it? However I want to
get off the beaten Christmas
track and not bother looking it
up for your benefit.
A long long time ago in a
galaxy far far away (picture
Scotland), there lived a wom-
an named Babs (okay so pic-
ture boobs). The three kings
stopped by her place on their
voyage to find the little babs,
Jesus (maybe don’t picture
boobs this time).
They asked her to accompany
them on their quest following
a star, a request comparable
to an offer to be in the studio
audience for the X-Factor final,
or some such joyous occasion.
And here’s where it gets
good; dear old Babs was too
busy with the household chores
(she just so happened to be
cleaning the floor as the kings
arrived). She knows her place
as a woman, no? That’s when
things took a nasty turn though.
She later set out to follow the
three kings with some gifts, re-
gretting not joining them earlier.
She asked around but could
not find them, nor the Baby
Jesus. Legend has it that she
is still looking and hence goes
about leaving trinkets for good
children, hoping they will help
her search. Good luck with that.
Truth is there are variations on
the theme of old Baboushka, al-
though “variation” seems a bit
of an understatement! In one
version, for example, Baboush-
ka does join the three kings
and gives her gifts to the Baby
Jesus. Pretty contradictory.
There is clearly no moral here.
My original version seems to
suggest that ardently doing the
housework does not pay which
we all know is not true; it is the
price of one husband.
