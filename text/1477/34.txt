Album of The Week
Easily the most ambitious musical campaign in the
history of the Internet, iamamiwhoami uploaded
a series of YouTube videos from December 2009
onwards, culminating in an incredible online “con-
cert” experience, shared by thousands of fans. Af-
ter much speculation over the identity of the artist,
it was revealed that Swedish pop singer Jonna Lee
was behind the affair, with the project being seem-
ingly self-financed. Seven equally incredible songs
were released on iTunes/Amazon, along with live
altered versions. These electronic pop “albums”
are in fact some of the most groundbreaking music
to grace our ears and are sure to garner increasing
adoration over years to come.

Bonobo
Troxy, Commercial Road
Saturday 11th December 2010
Bonobo’s fourth album
‘Black Sands’ might
have missed out on
being an album of the
year, but it is certainly
worth an honourable
mention. Playing the
Troxy this Saturday in
a rare UK show with a
full live band, he will be
showcasing his trade-
mark fusion of jazzy
melodies, electronica
and hip hop beats. Al-
though it might be a
bit steep at £30 a pop,
it’s undoubtedly going
to be good.

The Drums play the Forum
Not the first drums to play at The Forum, however they
may be the first to have taken human form
Holy Fuck...

Holy Fuck are a chaotic band. Every song they
play seemingly warrants an additional instru-
ment, and every new musical nuance is brought
about by haggard old equipment on the verge
of falling apart. One moment in the set sees a
band member amplifying film being wrenched
off a reel to add to the epic din.
It could, and perhaps should, all fall to piec-
es; splinter off in all directions and break down
into a formless mess. However, it is the pres-
ence of the powerful bass and drums of Matt
McQuaid and Matt Schulz that holds the music
together, providing the perfect foil for the two
noisemakers that make up the rest of the band.
Every wayward sound is anchored by their
locked-in grooves, and the results are thrilling
to witness.
Traditionally an improvisational group, Holy
Fuck have taken a turn towards more conven-
tional songwriting on their new album, Latin,
which places a greater emphasis on the devel-
opment of melodies throughout the tracks than
the group’s more pummelling earlier albums.
Interestingly, it is the new tracks that suffer the
most in a live context – the final synth wash
that plays out the last third of Latin America
gets almost entirely lost in the mix, and a short-
ened P.I.G.S. loses some of its slow-burning
power. Looser numbers, such as The Pulse, al-
low the band to let rip and show what made
Holy Fuck such an exciting live prospect in
the first place. These earlier songs, lacking the
constraints of song structure, allow the chaos
inherent in the band’s set-up to become the
band’s strength, as they let the rhythm dictate
the song’s form while noises, melodies and ev-
erything in between are piled on in relentless
abundance.
The Drums took to the stage in a euphoric
daze to the sound of electronic ambience that
echoed the electro-pop roots of founder mem-
bers Jonathan Pierce (vocals) and Jacob Gra-
ham (guitar). The four–piece were complete
with Tom Haslow on guitar and Connor Han-
wick providing the drums.
First up was Best Friend which in this writer’s
opinion is the band’s second best song. It has a
catchy tune to which you could imagine danc-
ing along at a wedding or some other family
function involving the older generations, with-
out the risk of offending Granny or Grandpa.
Pierce put in a strong performance through-
out, not just vocally but also with his animated
dance moves. His energy filled the room and
seemed to infect its inhabitants, with everyone
swaying on cue.
Set highlight Let’s Go Surfing prompted the
infamous “rock on” gesture from one member
of the audience (who would probably like to
remain anonymous). The simple and yet effec-
tive riffs were a real crowd-pleaser.
You may have noticed, however, that I’ve
only named two of the songs performed. That
may be because they were the only songs I
knew going into the gig or, more likely, be-
cause all their songs sound the same. For all
The Drums effort and enthusiasm in their live
performances, there isn’t a lot to their music.

Here are The Drums, conveniently pictured from left to right: Snare, Tom-Tom, Floor-
Tom and Bongo... Bongo feels a little left out as he’s not a standard part of the kit...
He’ll get over it
Lacking depth and any real substance, their
songs consist of straightforward motifs with a
big dollop of teenage angst, possibly account-
ing for their limited and somewhat juvenile de-
mographics.
Chaos and noise, as Holy Fuck dominate the Electric
Ballroom. What? That’s their name!
