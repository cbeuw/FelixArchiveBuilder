W
hat’s the point in
Christmas?
Before you start, I
should make it clear
I don’t have a per-
sonal grudge – or Grinch – against the
festive season. Far from it – this whole
month fills me with a child-like joy that
eagerly effervesces with each opened
advent calendar door. It would take
strong persuasion to convince me not to
live off mince pies and mulled wine for
the rest of my life.
But, much as I love Christmas, I can’t
see a purpose for it. Oh, of course, the
Christians (of which I am one) have
their reasons, and the pagans before
them. But in this secular age, why do we
celebrate Christmas?
Given the amount of time, effort and
money most people put into this season,
it is strange that the whole thing should
feel so...empty. After an overenthusi-
astic haircut for King Charles I, Oliver
Rhys Davies
Cromwell sought to ban Christmas. He
wanted religion without the party. These
days, people seem to want the party
without religion. I’m not saying that to
have a meaningful Christmas, you have
to trudge to church for hours, I just find
it hard to understand why people want to
celebrate...nothing.
However, even if Christmas in this
modern age is pointless, we should still
strive to preserve it and make it special.
In a perfect universe, everything would
have its place and nothing would exist
without reason. But this is not our real-
ity – we still have Piers Morgan, after
all. I prefer it when things have a reason,
but if they don’t, that doesn’t mean they
can’t be good.
People often talk about the “Christmas
spirit,” some kind of benevolent magic
in the air which facilitates serendipity
at a far higher frequency than normal.
I guess it’s inevitable; with so much
thought about other people’s presents,
parties, and placemats, some of that fo-
cus is bound to spill over into consider-
ing their wellbeing as well.
People seem to be more generous at
this time of the year and whatever the
reason, this is something that should be
celebrated.
However, I do have one issue with
this. People say they enjoy Christmas
because it allows them to spend time
with their families (Likewise, they also
hate it for the same reason). What’s stop-
ping them the rest of the year? If it only
takes bright lights and tinsel to engender
a sense of magnanimity in us, why don’t
we celebrate Christmas the whole year
round?
It would give me the excuse I need to
drink mulled wine in March.
Merry Christmas to all of you...or win-
ter Solstice, or whatever name you’re
giving to your celebrations. Regardless,
have a most festive season and a happy
new year!
“Why don’t we
celebrate Christmas
the whole year?”
Minced pies in June? If only!
We, the students of Imperial College
London, are alarmed and strongly
against the Life Science Restructure.
We feel that the planned restructure
will cause significant disruption to
student life within Life Sciences. If
it goes ahead, Imperial will damage
its reputation for excellence in teach-
ing and research. This move, and the
manner in which it has been handled
are not in the students’ best interest.
As students, we feel we have the
right to define our university. The top-
down approach of the restructure has
ignored the will of the student body.
The restructure limits Imperial’s ca-
pacity to produce world-class scien-
tists in a number of key disciplines
including Plant Science and Applied
Cell Biology. It suggests that students
do not value these disciplines, when in
fact they consistently attract students
at undergraduate and postgraduate
levels. Globally, scientists who are
trained in subjects like Food Secu-
rity and Biofuels are highly valued.
Research in these areas has been se-
verely affected, causing us to question
whether Imperial can provide stu-
dents with diverse training.
With the loss of 17 significant lec-
turers, the important question is
whether the current plans can provide
high quality teaching and practical
experience given the loss of expertise.
Will the teaching excellence provided
by these lecturers be compensated
for? The department will undergo a
Teaching Review shortly but clearly,
teaching was not taken into consider-
ation when this restructure was put in
place.Ameeting earlier on in the week
with Professor Ian Owens, confirmed
that the basis for the restructure was
to relieve Biology and Biochemistry
of the current financial situation and
to modernise the degrees by making
them more research-based.
Moreover, we fear that the restruc-
ture will affect postgraduates and
undergraduates alike with severe
disruption to modules and research
supervision. The current responses to
the issue are inadequate and we re-
quest a meeting with you, the Rector,
to discuss the following: the disrup-
tion to undergraduate modules and
to pastoral support; the disruption to
students with regards to supervision,
marking and technical advice; the dis-
ruption to PhD students including but
not limited to the removal of supervi-
sors, co-supervisors and advisors; and
to immediately address the issue of
funding for affected students.
If these matters cannot be resolved,
then the student body should make
its displeasure known to the public
through the National Student Survey
and other bodies.

Life Sciences cuts: Letters
Dear Rector, Protect tutors
Dear Sirs,
I have been shocked and upset at the
details that have emerged this week of
the Life Sciences ‘restructuring’. Par-
ticularly, the loss of Senior tutors, which
will greatly affect the pastoral support
available for students.
Unfortunately, during my time as an
undergraduate at Imperial I did not find
life easy. Several close members of my
family passed away, including my par-
ents. I lacked that familial support and
grounding which can be all-important
for a young person. For a long time, I
gave up all hope of getting a degree and
even considering working in Science.
However, this year I have graduated
with Ecology and Environmental Sci-
ence BSc, I am currently doing MRes
Entomology at the Silwood Park cam-
pus and am looking ahead to a career in
research.
I can honestly say that without the
Life Sciences department - their pa-
tience and encouragement, particularly
from Dr Simon Archer - I would not be
where I am now.
I know of many other present stu-
dents and Life Sciences graduates who
have also benefitted from support in the
department.

wood Park campus
Protect teaching
Dear Sirs,
I came to university to get an edu-
cation, not fund research! Yet Imperial
thinks it acceptable to callously dismiss
some of the best teaching staff in the
department. I think the fact that among
others, the admissions tutor is going,
tells you all you need to know about Im-
perial’s attitude towards undergraduate
studies.
These cuts will massively impact on
our learning in biochemistry: many of
those let go were course convenors for
final year modules which will now be
cut from the course, and all of the names
on the list were among the best lecturers
in the first year.
Imperial is really shooting itself in the
foot by doing this for two main reasons:
those of us (biochemistry undergradu-
ates) who were thinking of a career in
research will surely think twice hav-
ing seen how an allegedly world class
institution treats its employees. Also,
many PhD and MSc students say they
wouldn’t have been inspired to do re-
search if it hadn’t been for the stellar
teaching of these members of staff.
Imperial is making a grave error in
sacking many of the staff in biochemis-
try who give a damn about teaching.
Guy Needham (2nd year biochemistry
student)
Dear Sirs,
I must address some of the
points raised by Mr Davies
[in last week’s article entitled
“Flee! Flee the St John Ambu-
lance Service!”] I stress that
these are my personal views.
Mr Davies’ implicit sugges-
tion that [St John Ambulance’s
volunteers] are eager to defibril-
late someone at the first oppor-
tunity to “try [the equipment]
out” is tantamount to compar-
ing the organisation’s members
to mad scientists wanting to
test equipment on wounded
guinea pigs- a suggestion that
leaves a very bitter taste in the
mouth and is needless to say
untrue.
Moreover, the suggestion that
avoiding St John Ambulance
avoids “the grim spectre of
death” could well be interpreted
as libellous. If Mr Davies has
any actual examples of clinical
malpractice I suggest he refers
them through the appropriate
channels rather than making
unsubstantiated claims in the
press. His assertion that St
John Ambulance’s presence is
a deterrent to injury on the ba-
sis of incompetence is entirely
refutable and indeed offensive.
St John Ambulance is not,
and never has been, a sub-
stitute for a local GP
, A+E, nor
the London Ambulance Service
– they exist as an emergency
first aid service to save lives
and reduce injury, something
it is extremely effective at do-
ing. I would perhaps direct Mr
Davies to look at some recent
studies outlining the benefit of
immediate first aid treatment
in a scenario such as Cardiac
Arrest, the definitive medical
emergency, and perhaps he
would see that people do come
out of the Ambulances (at the
hospital, for his reference) and
subsequently from the hospi-
tal; a life saved that would oth-
erwise have been lost.
I could go on with much more
of the work SJA does in the
community and beyond, but
for fear of barracking the point
I will not print them here. I do
have to thank Mr Davies for get-
ting the syntax of the organisa-
tion’s name correct, which is
a common fault in the press –
perhaps if he had put as much
research into the work of St
John Ambulance as he has on
the correct spelling of the name
then his comment piece would
have been much less painful to
read.
Faithfully yours,
Jaimie Henry
