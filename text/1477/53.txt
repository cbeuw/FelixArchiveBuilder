If you’ve ever played minesweeper, then
you should be able to understand this
puzzle. The number in each box repre-
sents the number of lines that can exist
around it. Lines can never cross! In the
end, you will end up with a closed loop.
Just have a look at the solution in the op-
posite page.

Don’t look so surprised y’all, you
know how this works by now, surely?
Every row, column and three by three
square must contain each letter once.
The end result. This week sends best
wishes to you all this Christmas!
Then again, you’re running out of time
to do coursework, so solving it may
make your week worse. Nice paradox! F

PZZLZ, PLZ!
Slitherlink too hard? Nonogram too
easy? Do you despair at the overly
simplified cryptic crosswords? We
at Felix puzzles may give you lot too
much or too little credit for puzzle
solving, so these wonderful pages may
not be a suitable challenge.
Obviously, we can’t know about the
quality without feedback! Suggestions
about diﬃculty, or any puzzles you’d
like to see/go away, tell us at
puzzles.felix@imperial.ac.uk

1. Which word in the English lan-
guage contains the consecutive letters
“wkw”?
2. Santa lives in the north pole, 6
months of summer and the other 6
months, the mercury dips down! Santa
owns a lake which has a small island.
He wants to build a toy factory over
there and needs to carry over the re-
quired materials. Sadly, he can’t use his
sledge till winter as the reindeers are
lazy. Mrs Clause does not allow him to
get a ship or anything which you can
use to transport all the materials to the
island! What will santa do in order to
carry the stuﬀ to the island so he can
build the factory for toys?
