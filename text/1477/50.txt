Srsly guys. Wtf is this wikileaks
stuff all about?
Plants? They’re a fairytale!
I
n a radical step, Imperial College
has broken away from the scien-
tific community to declare that
plants are actually a figment of
the imagination. When questioned
about the fact that there were quite ob-
viously a lot of green things about the
place, a spokesperson for the college said
that they were mainly “Empty cans of
beer, rotten food and Waitrose shopping
bags”.
Imperial went on to say that since plants
don’t exist it would be silly to retain any
of its plant sciences staff and have sent
them a text message telling them to have
their desks cleared out by the end of the
academic year. “We would have spoken
to them personally but didn’t want to
catch their plant believing madness” said
College; it went on to say that “affected
PhD students would receive a £5 book
token and be sent on their way unless an
exorcism could be performed to relieve
them of their planty-osity”.
When it was pointed out that this move
would leave a rather large gap in the
teaching timetable, College replied that it
would “Give students time to learn about
green things that were real like frogs and
global warming. And besides, this isn’t
primary school - you’re supposed to be
teaching yourselves by now – what do
you think Wikipedia is for?”. College
had no comment when asked how they
expected remaining staff to maintain
their high standards of teaching once
their workload had doubled other than to
suggest that maybe students could mark
each other’s exam scripts.
At a staff student meeting one student
asked “If plants don’t exist then why does
college pay thousands of pounds a year
to replace the grass on the Queen’s Lawn
before killing it again by putting a mar-
quee over it?” The reply was “Don’t be
daft, of course grass exists – it’s a sym-
biosis between a fungus and a photosyn-
thetic bacterium. Did you pay no atten-
tion in the first year? This is exactly why
we’re not going to bother teaching you
lot anymore.” Felix found this student in
the Union later rocking backwards and
forwards muttering the word “lichens”
over and over.
In an effort to prove to College that
plants do in fact exist, students have been
placing shrubs, flowers and the occa-
sional root vegetable outside the faculty
building. When we asked a passing staff
member to comment on the protest she
said “It’s nice to see a bit of green around
here, it gets a bit depressing sitting in
a blue cube all day. How much are the
turnips?”
After talks as to whether those under-
graduates registered on the Plant Biol-
ogy degree should be sectioned under
the mental health act or would be able
to continue their studies, College was
happy to announce that the degree would
continue under the new title of “Green
Things”. The biology department has
said that it is pleased to offer new final
year courses that will fulfill the “Green
Things” degree requirement including
“What is that nasty stuff under the drawer
in my fridge?”,“Eating that was a bad
idea, wasn’t it?” and “How to find a John
Lewis’”.
Do you know
what definitely
does exist?
Poon-tang...
What? Just
sayin’...
*whistles, man
it’s a long way
down isn’t it?
Don’t be silly, plants don’t exist! Now go back to sleep...
WAKE UP PEOPLE! NONE OF THIS REAL! YOU’RE BEING TRICKED! IT’S
THE REPTILIANS IN CAHOOTS WITH THE MOLE PEOPLE!

Letters
Dear Sirs, I have noticed a startling re-
semblance between our Head of Life
Sciences Ian Owens and the Radio 1 DJ
Chris Moyles.

Dear Sirs, I have noticed that you have
stolen a type of joke, unashamedly I
might add, from the illustrious pages of
the Private Eye magazine. I am extreme-
ly disappointed and I will be ceasing my
subscription to Hangman immediately.
Yours Sincerely,
