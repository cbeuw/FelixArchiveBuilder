Formula 1: An alternative
view to ‘Pedal to the
Vettel’ from Joe Taylor
Want to know how you did last week? Go to the Puzzles section >>
H
aving read the Formula
1 review in Issue 1474,
I found several points
I completely disagree
with.
Firstly, team orders. I believe that
Ferrari were completely correct to ask
Massa to move over and allow Alonso
through. At that point in the season, both
drivers were a long way behind the Red
Bulls and the McLarens, so focussing
on the Alonso, the higher scoring and
generally faster driver was the only sen-
sible option. Although team orders are
officially banned, this was a pointless
knee–jerk reaction to Ferrari abusing
them in Austria in 2002, where Michael
Schumacher was miles ahead of anyone
and there was no need to swap positions
to gain him an extra 4 points for victory.
Since the ban, there have been several
times when team orders have been used
and no one has battered an eyelid. For
example, at the Chinese Grand Prix in
2008, Kimi Raikkonen allowed Felipe
Massa pass him. No one made a fuss
about this because it was the end of the
season and the team were giving their
lead driver the best possible chance of
winning. No different to Germany this
year then, except it occurred earlier in
the season.
Team orders have always been a part
of the sport. In fact, in 1956, Ferrari
driver stopped to let his team mate Juan
Manuel Fangio take over his car in or-
der to win the championship despite the
fact that Moss also had a chance to win.
To put that in perspective, it would be
like Sebastian Vettel letting Mark Web-
ber take over his car in Abu Dhabi, had
Alonso got himself into a championship
winning position. From the examples I
have given, you might think that team
orders are unfair as only Ferrari use
them. Not true. For example, in 1998,
David Coulthard was ordered to move
over to allow Mika Hakkinen to win
the Australian Grand Prix. Furthermore,
in last week’s Abu Dhabi Grand Prix,
Mark Webber found it awfully easy to
overtake fellow Red Bull family driver
Jaime Alguersuari considering that
Massa spent the entire rest of the race
stuck behind him. So, to conclude, team
orders have their place in Formula 1,
can you confirm you understood that
message?
Moving on, the new teams. Far from
being ‘unpleasant boils’, I think they
have done an excellent job this season
and proved how tough Formula 1 is.
First of all, Lotus: They were only
given the go ahead to enter in late Sep-
tember 2009, meaning that their car had
a gestation period of less than 6 months.
With that in mind, being as close to the
pace and as reliable as they were in the
early part of the season was a remark-
able achievement. OK, they didn’t gain
any ground on the other teams after the
season start, but given the development
rate in Formula 1 and the fact that Lotus
decided half way through the season to
concentrate on next year’s car, this is not
unexpected. I’m not going to get into the
name argument here as it’s the longest,
dullest and most confusing conflict you
will ever read about, but given how the
team has performed this year and how
they have the blessing of Colin Chap-
man’s son Clive, who heads Classic
Team Lotus, I think they are fully de-
serving of the name.
Virgin Racing, a combination of suc-
cessful sportscar designer Wirth Re-
search and multiple Formula 3 champi-
onship winners Manor Motorsport also
managed a solid effort. Yes, the fuel
tank mistake was embarrassing, but it
was the result of an inexperienced team
pushing the limits of then unconfirmed
regulations and was quickly sorted once
discovered. The team experienced reli-
ability problems in the early part of the
season, but nothing worse than Sauber,
whose car was designed with the ben-
efits of significant funding from BMW.
HRT: ok, I’ll give you that, they were
pretty rubbish, but considering their
budget for the entire year was around
38 pence, the fact that they started every
race is pretty commendable. HRT were
using chassis designed by Dallara, who
are the dominant constructor in several
sub-F1 race series, again proving that
even for the best, Formula 1 is difficult
to succeed in.
Still, could be worse: USF1, the fourth
accepted entry managed no more than
several million press releases, resulting
in a surprisingly accurate parody, which
revolved around the idea that the team
spent all of their time building toasters
instead of cars.
So, to summarise the new teams, I be-
lieve they have all done a very good job
this year, considering their comparative-
ly low budgets, inexperience at the top
level and the short period between the
acceptance of their entries and the first
race, in which they had to design and
build their cars from scratch.
