And so it has come to pass. After weeks
of seemingly endless student protests,
vicious exchanges across the House of
Commons and many uneasy grumbles
from within the Liberal Democrats, the
Government‚Äôs proposal to raise the tu-
ition fee cap passed through the House
of Commons late Thursday afternoon,
with 323 votes for versus 302 against
Under the terms of the proposal, the
cap on tuition fees for home and EU
students (currently standing at ¬£3,290)
will be almost trebled, to ¬£9,000. This
increase is, the Government claims, nec-
essary in order to balance university fi-
nances and develop a ‚Äúfairer‚Äù system of
funding. Numerous critics have hit back,
however, arguing that the increase will
only be used to offset the cuts in public
higher education funding ‚Äì a massive
80% in some subjects.
Much of the anger has been directed
towards the Liberal Democrats, who,
prior to the election (in a move that
has come back time and again to haunt
them) pledged to abolish university fees
entirely. Now enjoying the dubious plea-
sures of coalition rule, the party finds it-
self in support of a proposal that both its
MPs and its supporters (many of them
students) find fundamentally repellent.
Being the junior partner in the Coali-
tion, the Lib Dems have already had to
make many concessions ‚Äì fiscal auster-
ity, defence spending and immigration
policy are but a few. All these ‚Äì though
marginally watered down from the Tory
hard-line ‚Äì nevertheless ran contrary to
the Liberal Democrats‚Äô values. But for
most of the party‚Äôs MPs it was a price
worth paying for their first position of
power in living memory. However, roll-
ing back on their promise to abolish fees
seemed like a step too far. Thousands of
students who supported the party in the
last election took to the streets, express-
ing an indignant sense of betrayal. In the
face of this, Nick Clegg stood resolutely
(though not altogether cheerfully) by the
Coalition‚Äôs plans. But many in his party
were not convinced. A number of back-
bench MPs said that they would abstain
from the vote; a few rebels even threat-
ened to vote against, contravening the
rules of the Coalition Agreement.
In the end, for better or for worse, the
rebels were capitulated. The Coalition‚Äôs
substantial majority in the House of
Commons meant that those abstaining
or opposing were not significant enough
to overcome the collective will. The mo-
tion passed with a majority of twenty-
one; perhaps a narrower margin of vic-
tory then the Government expected, but
a victory all the same.
Amongst the protestors marching
on Whitehall for a fourth consecutive
week, the sentiment was less amicable.
Although the result came as no surprise,
it is bound to stoke further anger. It re-
mains to be seen whether the relentless
wave of student protests, that has of late
engulfed that nation like wildfire, will
burn on or fizz out.
