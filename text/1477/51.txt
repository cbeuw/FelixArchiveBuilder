Scorpio
You grow a third nipple overnight. Your
doctor can’t explain it, and it keeps
growing. Soon it is so large that it re-
sembles a breast. men start paying more
attention to you and you finally feel val-
ued as a person. It explodes in a violent,
pus-filled tsunami of pain. Lolpwn3d.

Horoscopes
Aries
Your department is running a secret
santa. You are so very excited, until you
realise that your subject has been cut.
Not only is your degree shit, now you
won’t even receive a crap present you
don’t want off of someone you don’t
even like.
Taurus
You are a hard to catch pokémon. You
laugh at me from the long grass. I
throw a rock at you. You look angry.
Oh god! Can I begin to hope? I throw
a ball at you. bounce bounce... OH
SHOOT! IT WAS SO CLOSE, TOO!
ARGGGHHHH!
Gemini
You pick up a copy of I, Science. What
the hell is this? Punctuation in titles
went out of fashion with Panic! At
The Disco, what are they playing at?
Outraged, you hurl it to the ground.
You get an on-the spot fine for littering,
twat.
Cancer
After Christmas dinner you combine
boardgames, namely Game of Life
and Monoopoly. You go to uni. The
rent is £9,000 a year. You throw a fire-
extinguisher off the roof of Millbank
tower. Go to jail. Go directly to jail. Do
not pass go. Do not collect £200.
Leo
You listen to a friend talking in Por-
tugese. It’s kinda hot. Unfortunately he
starts talking about dick-shit (apparently
it’s when shit comes out of your dick af-
ter “riding the bakerloo line”) and you
are now confused by your arousal. He
goes to the toilet. You slyly follow him.
Virgo
The authorities in Sweden are all
over your case for some reason. It’s
something to do with you standing
on the houses of parliament shouting
BORK BORK BORK, but you’re
convinced that it’s a US conspiracy
against you.
Libra
It’s Christmas so you decide to buy a
beautiful Christmas tree. You order it
online, but someone nicks it from out-
side your house to lay it in front of the
university faculty building. Plant Sci-
ences are history, and your lovely tree
is no more. Happy sodding Christmas.
Sagittarius
You bitch about someone to a friend.
The next day, the transcript of your
bitchiness is published on Wikileaks.
Now everyone in the world knows how
much of a douche you are. 4chan users
hack your bank account and spend all
your money on lube and crackers.
Capricorn
You go to a Christmas dinner you
believed was fancy dress. It wasn’t.
Everyone laughs at you, but you make
a wonderful turkey. You wake up
halfway inside an oven, dripping with
gravy. Someone is coming at you with
a baster- noooOOOOO!
Aquarius
You attend the Musical about Impe-
rial college. Inspired, you spend the
rest of the week only talking in verse.
Unfortunately this affects your acqui-
sition of knowledge, and makes your
friends and lecturers think you’re
perverse.
Pisces
While standing outside the East
basement window, you notice a whole
room of people playing Yu-Gi-Oh.
Delighted you go home, get your
Bakura cosplay outfit and head back.
Turns out you imagined them, and
cheese society are very confused.

GAZA STRIP”

pictures of ass then I wouldn’t have to print thousands of copies of it!!!
