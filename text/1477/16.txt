So you’ve got about £100 to spend and you want something cool,
something current, something ultimately useful?
In steps Amazon’s Kindle 3. OK, it’s not exactly £100, it’s more like
£109, but the 6” E Ink screen on the latest addition to the Kindle fam-
ily is in a class of it’s own. Featuring even better contrast, battery life
of about a month (!), and now with built-in WiFi meaning it’s cheaper
and you don’t have to rely
on a 3G radio, per-
haps now is the
best time to get
that special per-
son the ultimate
eBook reader?
They can buy
and sync their
books with the
Amazon eBook
store, plus with
Kindle apps
on the iPhone,
Android or
Blackberry.
It’ll even do
a bit of basic
web browsing
in a pinch.
Free App of the Week
iOS - Skype for iPhone
Keep in touch with your college friends whilst you’re
back home for free with Skype on the iPhone. Make
VoIP calls over WiFi or 3G. Simple and effective.
VoIP
, IM, even Skype out, the Skype app for Android
says to the iPhone: everything you can do I can do
better. But Neither of them can make with the video.

Christmas Gift Guide
Sam Gibbs talks gift ideas to suit almost any budget
Left: The
Amazon
Kindle,
who reads
physical
books
these days
anyway??
First up we’ve got the under £25 category, and
while there’s quite a lot you can get for under a
quarter of a ton, there’s not much better, and more
useful, than a flash drive. Problem is flash drives
are a dime a dozen these days, and while they
come in all shapes and sizes most
are downright dull.
In steps the Stormtroop-
er Unmasked Star Wars
MIMOBOT. Touted as a
‘designer flash drive’ the
MIMOBOT series of offi-
cial Star Wars flash drives
brings a bit of nostalgia
and fun to the otherwise
mundane duty of storage.
Prices range from £13 up
to about £40, for different
storage sizes, while char-
acters are available from all
over the Star Wars universe.

For the under £50 category our money is
on a decent set of noise isolating head-
phones. Chances are your tech lov-
ing recipient is going to have a
pocket device capable of rocking
their brains with tunes, so why not
give them something good to listen
to it with.
Sound isolators like the Sennheiser
CX870, which can be purchased under
£50, block out the noise around the lis-
tener passively, by acting like earplugs
with speakers in them.
Great for noisy com-
mutes, working in
shared spaces or
simply blocking out
inane chatter. They
don’t half sound
good either, and will
work with almost anything.

£100-ish Blow the boat out
OK, so the Kindle 3 is cool, but if you’ve got a budget the size of a
months food bill, then there’s only one must have gift this Christmas
and that’s the Apple iPad.
Available in several flavours, but starting out at £429 for the
16GB WiFi-only version, the iPad has redefined tablet computing,
and truly carved a niche out for itself against traditional computing
platforms like the humble laptop, netbook and even to some extent
the desktop.
Although it’s not
a true comput-
er in and of
itself, you
still have to
sync it with
a computer
to be able
to use it,
the iPad
does many
things
very well.
Web
browsing,
email,
video and
games
— you
won’t

much
better-a-
gift this
holiday
season.
£429,
