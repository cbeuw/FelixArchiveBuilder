RECTOR SLAMS
ASTMS LEADERS
On Friday, 21st Decem-
ber (last day of the college
term) the Rector, Sir
Brian Flowers, addressed
a letter to the secretary of
the college A S T M S
branch. This was in reply
te their accusations lev-
elled at the college admin-
istration in general and
the personnel officer in
particular. The letter is
printed in full as the
Rector hopes that it will
be as widely publicised as
possible. It appears that
the ASTM's attempt to
"try out" the new Rector
over a strong political
point is not going to go
the way their leaders
would like. Printed here
are the two letters and I'll
let you judge for yourself.
To all members of the
(governing Body:
It is axiomatic that the
College administration
will stand between the
(governing Body and the
staff of the College. We
<Jq not know how the A d -
ministration report on
mon-academic staff mat-
ters or on College based
trade unions. We only
know what the College
Administration carry out
in the name of the Gov-
erning Body. We know
that secretly, to give
favours to non-trade uni-
onists, the College Admin-
istration is breaking a
national agreement. We
know that there was
extensive questioning of
applicants for a post of
Departmental Superinten-
dent regarding member-
ship of ASTMS, centred
round the insulting atti-
tude of loyalty to A S T M S
vis-a-vis loyalty to the
College.
You will therefore not
be surprised if we take
the opportunity to report
direct to you and else-
where, in such a way as is
constructive. The enclosed
copy of an open letter is
such a report.
Yours sincerely,
Mr. H . Fairbrother,
Secretary.
A n Open Letterâ€”
Should the Personnel Sec-
retary Resign?
There is an organisa-
tion existing to which
most Personnel Officers
belong. This organisation
aims to foster high stand-
ards of integrity in that
profession. It proclaims
that the function of a Per-
sonnel Officer is to hon-
estly attempt to solve
industrial relations prob-
lems, even if this involves
disagreeing with their
employer.
Does M r . Malone mea-
syre up to these admirable
standards?
It is the view of the
Branch Committee that
he does not.
The College brought
him in to improve staff-
College relations, at least
that what was the former
Rector said at the time.
The reverse has happened.
Never has there been such
a bad and disgraceful situ-
ation as now exists.
The National Agree-
ment requires the post of
Departmental Superinten-
dent to be part of the
Technical Staff structure,
if the work done is the
same as the Job Descrip-
tion in the Blue Book,
Everybody knows that that
is the case in this College,
nevertheless the College
will not comply with this
Agreement.
We have a local agree-
ment that a special crit-
eria should be used to
decide whether Experi-
mental Officers should be
regarded as Academic or
Technical Staff. We are
sure that this is being bro-
ken, and that some "blue
eyed boys" are being
Slipped through as para-
Academics, when they do
not meet the criteria.
Every request by us to
be able to check what has
happened has been evad-
ed.
There is a National
Agreement covering the
way in which Non Union
people can appeal against
their gradings. This agree-
ment involves our partici-
pation in the Appeals
Committee. We have now
discovered that this is also
being secretly broken.
Non-Union Experimental
Officers who had been
placed in the Technical
Staff, but believe that they
should be 'Academics',
a r e appearing before
Special Appeal Commit-
tees, without either our
knowledge or agreement.
Our protests have been
ignored.
Months ago we dis-
cussed with the College a
request by us for direct
A S T M S representation on
both the Safety and Train-
ing Committee. We were
promised an early reply.
Not only has there been
no reply, but we know
that IC has since made a
statement to the Univers-
ity Safety Officers Com-
mittee that there should
be no Union representa-
tion on any Safety Com-
mittee.
In April last we made
proposals to regrade a
member of the Mainten-
ance staff who holds a
responsible position. It is
our view that he should
be graded as a Mainten-
ance Officer and properly
paid. In fact he is under-
paid and graded as a
Clerk. In the last month
we have made three re-
quests for a meeting to
clear the matter up, but
have failed to get a meet-
ing.
Similarly with the Col-
lege Telephone Engineers.
Hitherto they have been
linked with the Techni-
cians for grading and pay.
With restructuring what
will happen to them?'
Repeated requests for a
meeting bring promises
but no meeting.
All the above are but a
selection of the problems
that we have been unable
to solve. The most serious
question, however, is the
totally unacceptable situa-
tion on Restructuring of
the Technical Staff.
There were 149 appeals
by Union members, 54
have been heard, leaving
95 yet to be done. Every
other London College has
finished the entire proce-
dure, local, Regional and
National level appeals.
The absence of any effort
by the College to com-
plete the exercise is due to
an attitude of contempt
by them for the Technical
Staff.
. Moreover, despite the
fact that in some depart-
ments, notably Mechanic-
al Engineering Depart-
ment, the exercise was
carried out in the most
inefficient and biased
manner, no attempt has
been made to rectify the
bad initial gradings. This
has resulted in members
being forced into the
Appeals machinery quite
unnecessarily, and with
no guarantees of obtain-
ing justice.
There has been extra-
ordinary happenings affec-
ting individuals, even
including attempts at
intimidation. The case of
our Branch Chairman,
Arthur Sier, being one of
the worst. The Personnel
Secretary told him quite
bluntly that if he put his
own case to appeal, then
he would be made to re-
gret it!
Needless to say those
remarks were made to the
wrong address!!
So, where do we Go?
Can we go on like this?
About a year ago, all of
the Unions in the College
met the College Secretary
to request changes in the
attitude of the Personnel
Department. Promises
were made but things are
now worse than ever.
It is now becoming
clear that normal nego-
tiating channels are being
closed to us. This we will
not tolerate.
There are other ways
to get things done and we
must be prepared to use
them.
On behalf of the
Branch Committee,
H. Fairbrother,
Secretary.
CONSTITUTIONAL
REFORM
At the last meeting of
Council a working party
was set up to look into the
present constitution, bye-
laws and standing orders.
There are a lot of incon-
sistencies contained with-
in the present Blue Book
and these will be the first
to be removed. It is also
intended that there should
be some radical changes
in certain areas of the
Union, e.g. Council, Ex-
ternal Affairs. Another
failing of the present con-
stitution is the lack of
definition of what various
officers and representa-
tives are actually expected
to do. It is hoped that
everyone, from the Presi-
dent down to department
and floor reps, will even-
tually have some defini-
tion and guide-lines as to
their purpose.
The first changes aris-
ing out of this will hope-
fully be seen at the first
U G M this term. Standing
Orders only require to be
passed at one U G M with
notice having been given
beforehand. A new set of
standing orders, covering
most of the present points
and also including several
new ones will be put be-
fore the meeting. It is
hoped that these, com-
bined with more efficient
chairing, will greatly
streamline the running of
the Union Meetings with
less chance of time-wast-
ing techniques. Copies of
these new standing orders
should be available soon
(if not sooner) and com-
ments on them will be
gratefully received. Paul
Wadsworth, Hon. Sec,
will accept the comments
on these and on changes
that Union members
would like to see to the
Union Blue Book. Please
address all correspondence
on the matter to Paul, c/o
the Union Office.

COLL
LEVEL TWO
WALKWAY
Dear M r . Fairbrother,
In my letter of 8 Nov-
ember I said that I had
asked the College Secre-
tary to seek a meeting
with you to examine your
specific complaints. He
has now reported to me.
Some of the issues about
which you complain are
those where College deci-
sions have been taken
which the Personnel Sec-
retary is therefore instruc-
ted to implement; some
are of a policy nature and
require further considera-
tion and discussion; and
there are others less signi-
ficant, perhaps, which,
given good will on both
sides, it should be possible
to resolve without acri-
mony or delay. No doubt,
in all these issues, there
may be differences of in-
terpretation of local or
national agreements. And
perhaps there are, or will
be, genuine differences of
opinion. That is inevitable,
and it is why we need
machinery for settling our
differences.
For my part, I intend
to do what I can to ensure
that all sections contri-
bute to the life of the
College in the way best
suited to their talents and
to the general good. What
I am not prepared to do
in any circumstances is to
conduct business by way
of deliberate misrepre-
sentations and crude
threats. I reject entirely
any statement or sugges-
tion that the College has
shown favour to one sec-
tion of the staff against
another. I find particular-
ly unacceptable the sort
of intemperate language
which, from my reading
of the file, seems to char-
acterise almost every
communication from IC
ASTMS, both public and
private. I would be reluc-
tant to believe that your
membership, comprising
so many of the excellent
and loyal technical staff of
the College, subscribes to
this method of doing busi-
ness.
Although, therefore,
some policy issues are still
outstanding and although
our administrative meth-
ods will continue to
require development to
deal with a changing set
of problems, I propose to
instruct the College offi-
cers not to respond in
future to communications
(whether written or ver-
bal) couched in the terms,
for example, of your
letter to Mr, Malone of
the 29 November on Ap-
peals Machinery.
I trust that you will
make known to your
members the contents of
this letter. I am myself
copying it to the Deans
and to Heads of all De-
partments who may wish
to circulate it more wide-
ly.
Yours sincerely,
Brian Flowers.
