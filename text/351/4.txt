RECTORS PLAN FOR COLLEGE DEVELOPMENT
Since he arrived Sir Brian Flowers has been giving some thought to the
direction in which he would like to see the college develop along. Printed here is
the major part of a speech that he gave at an Old Centralians Luncheon on
Thursday, 13th December, 1973.
Following on from this Sir Brian brought the subject up again at the Board
of Governors meeting, giving them a potted version of the same speech. He also
mentioned, in particular, the Mass. Institute of Technology and the way in which
they aim for the total technological activity of the subjects they work in. The
governors appeared to be wholly in favour of the Rector's suggestions and gave
him leave to continue with investigations into its feasibility.
Students' direct
action over grants
goes on-Randall
The central problem of
my past life has been how
to determine scientific
priorities. Many people
probably think that I con-
cerned myself with the
giving of grants to indi-
vidual university profes-
sors to enable them to
carry out their research.
Indeed, I was very much
concerned with the sys-
tem for doing that, but I
hardly ever had to con-
cern myself with a par-
ticular case. In particular
cases the central issue is
ahvays "Is that a good
and promising piece of
chemistry?" or "Is that a
worthwhile piece of mech-
anical engineering?" Only
the chemists and mechan-
ical engineers, as the case
may be, can answer those
questions, and the peer-
group system of the re-
search councils is deficient
at this only insofar as it
comprises fallible human
beings.
The much more diffi-
cult questions are "How
much should we spend
altogether on chemistry?"
or "What avenues would
we particularly like to en-
courage mechanical en-
gineers to explore?" These
are difficult because they
pose problems which fall
outside the competence of
the peer-group. How
much we spend on chem-
istry is not only a matter
for the chemists: firstly
because with finite re-
sources what they spend
is not then available for
mechanical engineers to
spend; but much more im-
portantly because in the
end all the sciences, pure
and applied, arc intercon-
nected and interdependent.
Chemists, to continue with
the example, are great
users of instrumentation,
very little of which they
devise themselves. The
progress of chemistry,
even the direction it takes,
thus depends almost as
much upon the products
i>f other disciplines as
upon the activities of
chemists.
You notice I've made
no mention of physicists:
they are quite different!
So in trying to deter-
mine the priorities of in-
dividual academic disci-
plines we see emerging in-
terdisciplinary questions
to be answered. There is
in fact a hierarchy of
such questions. For in the
end government has to
provide for most of the
research that is done (as
distinct from develop-
ment, although it funds
a lot of that as well).
Governments are not in-
terested (or should not be
if the system is working
properly) in how much
we spend on chemistry or
on any other academic
discipline. Their problems
are quite different. They
should not even have to
worry much about re-
search, as such. They are
concerned with the great
social objectives: how
much do we want, and
are prepared to spend on
improved industrial pro-
ductivity, more relevant
education, better health,
urban renewal, alterna-
tive energy sources, de-
fence; and so on. Each of
these demands research;
but the priorities to be
set at Government level
are social priorities, not
academic ones; in one
way or another, all aca-
demic activity is under-
taken in support of social
objectives.
The problem I was con-
cerned with in my previ-
ous existence was that of
trying to match a little
better the intrinsic needs
and capabilities of the
various academic disci-
plines to the extrinsic
needs of social, political
and economic reality.
This, for me, was what
science policy was all
about, and very interest-
ing it was too. One had
to learn to see scientific
priorities as a two-dimen-
sional affair: the various
scientific activities in one
dimension and the ulti-
mate needs for it in an-
other. A structure was re-
quired in both dimen-
sions, and somehow one
had to try to match the
two structures.
Well, what is the rele-
vance of this lengthy dia-
tribe to Imperial College?
We are, of course, one of
the leading institutions
for training scientists and
engineers, and for re-
search in these subjects.
As far as that aspect is
concerned, where we are
not so good we must sim-
ply strive to become so.
But I believe we are pe-
culiarly fitted — and in
this we may well be un-
ique in this country — to
train students for, and to
take part in the totality
of technological activity.
This means that we must
first recognise it for what
it is: something "essential-
ly multi-disciplinary. And
this means, that although
our teaching must always
be founded upon the well-
established academic dis-
ciplines (for otherwise it
lacks intellectual integ-
rity), that teaching must
be enriched by a much
wider experience drawn
from the real life of in-
dustry and government
and the professions, and
from other disciplines.
And that in turn means
that there is no room at
Imperial College for rigid
academic boundaries, or
for heads of departments
who believe they are self-
sufficient: the barons, we
call them.
I have been greatly en-
couraged by discussing in
our Board of Studies the
results of a survey, under-
taken by Sir David
Huddie, of what our gra-
duates from 1929 to 1963
thought of the education
we gave them, and where
it has got them. Those
who had done best of all
turned out to be a very
select band indeed who,
having achieved no better
than a pass degree, then
went on to become doc-
tors of science. Tt just
shows, there's hope for
us all if we've got a bit
of blarney! What interes-
ted me most, however,
was the response to ques-
tions about content of the
course: what topics had
they found most useful,
which least useful, and es-
pecially Which subjects
would they now have
wished had been inclu-
ded? If this survey is any-
thing to go by the College
has adapted very well to
changing need because al-
most all preferences have
already been put into
effect: especially, we have
included a goodly sprink-
ling of multi-disciplinary
activities. Of course, what
we would really like to
know is what the students
of today will say about
us 20 years from now
when they are at the
height of their powers.
Have we only adapted to
the needs of yesterday, or
are we now really catering
for tomorrow, our proper
job?
I want to see whether
we cannot set up some
kind of two-dimensional
structure at Imperial Col-
lege, so that we can hope
—as a university, not as
an industry which we arc'
not—to face up better to
the totality of real tech-
nological activity. I de-
test talking in the ab-
stract, so let me give you
just one example of what
1 mean. You must regard
it for the moment as com-
pletely hypothetical, and
it certainly does not re-
present anyone's decision,
least of all those most
concerned.
Supposing we wanted
to match our educational
and research activities to
the total technological
needs of the aviation busi-
ness. What would we have
to do? Well, we have an
Aeronautics Department,
and very good it is too.
They are very expert in
aerodynamics, as you'd
expect, and in air-frame
structures, and they do
a bit of avionics. Unfor-
tunately, that doesn't get
the aircraft off the ground
because they do not work
on engines. Quite right,
too, because that should
be done in Mechanical
Engineering where they
know about such things,
together with Chemical
Engineering where they
know about fuels. Having
got it off the ground, how-
ever, you need a lot of
control engineering to fly
it safely, and communica-
tions engineering to get to
the right place at the right
time. You need a lot of
maintenance engineering
(tera-technology they call
it nowadays) to keep it in
service, and you need
management expertise to
stop the airline from go-
ing bust, not to mention
the manufacturer. In-
creasingly you need to see
aviation as but one econo-
mic (as well as techno-
logical) component of. an
integrated transportation
system. And you need to
attend to the special avia-
tion needs for all the
underlying sciences, such
as operational research
and the development of
special materials. If we
were really to take our
task in aviation seriously
in the College we would
have to pay attention to
all of that at least.
Now it would simply
be silly to try to do all
that in one academic de-
partment. It isn't one
academic discipline, to
start with, but a continu-
ous stratum of contiguous
disciplines and nobody
could be expected to
know it all. It would also
be uncontrollable. But we
could have strong hori-
zontal links labelled avia-
tion, running across and
connecting the vertical
structures labelled aero-
nautical engineering, mat-
erials technology, and
management science. And
through the horizontal
links we could try to feed
in the views Of the users
of aeroplanes, not just the
manufacturers: the air-
lines and — God help
them!—the passengers.
Of course, we should
have to consider other
horizontal links for other
major sectors of techno-
logical activity: high-
speed ground transport,
for instance (which might
still benefit from this
approach), or mineral re-
source production and
conservation.
Well, I told you that T;
was all going to be hypo-
thetical. It is probably
quite impracticable, and
I dare say the barons of
Imperial College will con-
vince me that it simply
cannot be done: it
wouldn't fit into their de-
partmental structures. But
it's what needs doing: and
it would be fun trying to
do it.
Students will not drop
their campaign for big-
ger and better grants,
Mr. John Randall, presi-
dent of the National
Union of Students, said
on Wednesday.
Even though it had
been suggested that stu-
dents should tighten
their belts along with the
rest of the country, rent
strikes, demonstrations
and other forms of direct
action by students would
continue, he told the
union's technical col-
leges conference in
Newcastle.
To those who made
an appeal to students in
support of a misguided
concept of the "national
interest", Mr. Randall
said: "Our campaign is
designed to pave the
way to an acceptance in
real terms of education
as a right for all. Demo-
cracy was once describ-
ed as "freedom based on
knowledge'. If access to
that knowledge is cur-
tailed, democracy is de-
valued.

expressed worries this
weekend as to the ef-

may have on the studies
of some students. It is
feared that some stu-
dents may have to give
interest that the currency
of democracy should be
maintained at the high-
est possible value. If the
Government shows any
reluctance to make pro-
vision for access to that
knowledge as of right
then it must be in the
national interest that we,
the recipients of what
little education is avail-
able, should campaign
with all the resources at
our disposal to consoli-
date and extend that
right."
Students must not al-
low themselves to be
seduced away from the
aims they had set them-
selves, he said. In No-
vember the NUS decided
to campaign for grants
of £655 a year.

cumstances in which we
have to fight are not of

they are those we are
faced with and we will

circumstances and turn
them to our advantage."
