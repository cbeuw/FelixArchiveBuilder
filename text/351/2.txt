Please Help Charit
Sir,
Stamp Collection for
Charity
Mrs. Burgess in the
Post Room, 4th floor,
Metallurgy Dept., is col-
lecting postage stamps
for charity. Any stamps
will do—foreign, British,
even ordinary 3p and
3^p stamps. They are
sold to stamp collectors
abroad. Just cut the
stamp from the envelope,
and when you have a
few, put them in the In-
ternal Mail to Mrs. Bur-
gess at the above ad-
dress.
Silver Foil Collection
for Charity
The John Percy Group
in the Metallurgy Dept.
'is saving silver f o i l —
milk tops, yoghurt con-
tainer tops, take-away
food containers, etc. etc.
(but clean please!). Keep
rolling your silver paper
up into a ball, and when
you have one 2 or 3
inches big, pop that into
an envelope addressed
to the John Percy Group,
Metallurgy Dept.
The Legal Aid Centre on
Golborne Road (off Lad-
broke Grove, near the
tube station) appears to
be having difficulty in
finding new premises. It
is having to send a peti-
tion to Kensington and
Chelsea Council to try
and get these badly
needed premises. The
Centre has helped many
thousands of local
people with legal prob-
lems, about three-quar-
ters of them absolutely
free of charge. Most of
these people would not
have been able to afford
any other form of legal
aid. So if you are a resi-
dent in the borough and
are in this area at all,
please pop 'into the cen-
tre and sign the petition.
It Is only a few minutes
walk from Ladbroke
Grove Tube Station.

Open letter to all
Club/Societies
Chairmen
Dear Chairman,
At present I am acting
as editor for Felix,
though this may change
in the near future. In the
meantime, however, I in-
tend (to go ahead with
one or two ideas for tfie
paper.
The first of these is a
regular Societies page.
In this I hope to present
an idea of the activities
etc. carried out by a
number of clubs each
week. Hopefully there
will be one club each
from A C C , SCO and R C C
in every edition. The sort
of questions ! would like
answered are
What does the club do?
Participation outside col-
lege
Success in anything
Where to find out more
Where to join
etc., etc., etc.
Some of the questions
are not relevant to every-
one. I would like be-
tween 400 and 600
words if possible. Pre-
refably no more but I
Will definitely accept
less. Typewritten entries
would be preferred, but
failing that neat hand-
writing please. I would
also be grateful if you
could count the number
of words and put this
number in the top right
hand corner of your sub-
mission. I will try and
submit them in the order
I receive them. First cop-
ies should reach me by
Tuesday, 15th January,
to go in the next edition.
This is your chance
to advertise your club.
Please use it.
P. A . Wadsworth.

Righteous
Bros.
Sir,
I feel moved to make
a point regarding ' G J K ' s '
review of Lindisfarne's
concert at IC. Please tell
him that even if the Wal-
ker Bros, did ever do
'You've lost that lovin'
feeling' I for one would-
n't want to hear it. The
people that did the defin-
itive version were the
Righteous Bros, and as
it happens to be 'in my
top 10, 20 whatever
singles of all time a mis-
take like that matters to
me.
D. A . Lewis,
Administration.
APOLOGY
Of course you are
right, and I alopogise for
the slip of the pen. Ap-
parently I also made a
bit of a boob concerning
Alan Hull, who I claimed
had left Lindisfarne. Any
other comments regard-
ing my reviews welcom-
ed.

JAY MEWS
Yes, last term squat
is still there—and now
has homeless families
with kids in it too. Stud-
ents, after all, are fight-
ing "for a 'living grant
and a decent place to
live i n " A N D decent
housing for everyone
else too.
An eviction order has
been granted to the own-
ers (the Commissioners
for the Exhibition of
1851, the college's land-
lords). They haven't
tried to use it properly
yet except on New Year's
eve, when they broke-in
(despite a promise made
in Court not to do any-
thing before the New
Year)—and left after be-
ing caught by three stud-
ents (see Joy Mews
News No. 3).
The owners have so
far failed to give clear
answers to three ques-
tions.
1. Will they undertake
not to attempt an
eviction before the
Court Appeal which
is being 'lodged
against them?
2. Will they allow the
premises to be used
at least until they
need 'it?
3. What do they intend
to do with the empty
houses anyway?
Come round to Joy
Mews, support the squat.
Be ready to rush there
and help defend it as
soon as you hear.
If students show their
support enough then
maybe the Cortege and
Westminster Council can
be forced—along with
the owners—to enable
more long term usage of
the empty properties for
students and families.
