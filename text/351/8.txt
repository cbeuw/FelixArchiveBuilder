EMERGENCY REGULATIONS
As you are all probably aware there
is at the moment a National State
of Emergency. The college, of course,
falls within the regulations and there-
fore has certain rules that it must
abide by.
1. The heating on college premises
has been reduced to a temperature
not exceeding 60°F, with the excep-
tion of residential accommodation,
the Health Centre, the Day Nursery,
animal houses and accommodation
used for food storage and for using
sensitive apparatus (to the extent
necessary to prevent damage or de-
terioration.
2. Required reductions in the in-
tensity of lighting throughout the Col-
lege are as follows:—
sa) No rooms may be lit if they are
unoccupied
b) No rooms may be lit in excess
of
(i) two watts per square foot
of floor area where the room is
lighted by tungsten lamps
(it) one watt per square foot
of floor area where the room is
lit by fluorescent lamp or by
both fluorescent and tungsten
lamps.
Further to these restrictions the
College is restricted to the use of elec-
tricity on three days in each week in
those rooms in all college buildings
which are described as offices, and
in the College Bookshop and the col-
lege branch of the NATWEST Bank.
On the two days in each week
when the use of electricity is pro-
hibited in offices, it will, however, be
permissible for electricity to be used
only for
a) operating communications
equipment (including apparat-
us for broadcast reception and
teleprinters)
b) operating any computer or any
other equipment necessary for
the proper functioning there-
of
c) operating apparatus for the pre-
paration of a payroll, cheque
sorting equipment and other
office machinery (e.g. electric
typewriters).
The working days in each week
when the use of electricity in college
offices is prohibited are Thursday
and Friday. The prohibition also ap-
plies to Saturday and Sunday.
It is not considered that the restric-
tions should lead to any necessity for
re-timetabling.
In the event of the conditions aris-
ing in offices whereby it becomes
impossible, through lack of light, to
carry on working, Heads of Adminis-
trative Sections, at their discretion,
may allow staff to go home but not
normally before 4 p.m. Heads of De-
partments may wish to give similar
instructions.
The following College services and
amenities are not under restrictions
and are to continue to operate, but
with due regard to the need for econ-
omy of use of lighting.
a) college and departmental lib-
raries
b) Refectories
c) Sports Centre (less the swim-
ming bath)
d) Day Nursery and Health Centre.
The Union falls within the regula-
tions but in different ways. As a recre-
ational area it is virtually exempt from
most of the regulations but every
effort must be made to keep the use
of electricity to a minimum.
Private parties are officially exempt
but if you feel it is necessary to have
a party, first preference will be given
to those held on Monday, Tuesday
or Wednesday. Outside bookings, if
they are of a private nature, are also
exempt but with the same proviso as
above.
Union committees and official func-
tions will be given preference over
private parties over outside bookings
but again they are encouraged to be
held in the first three days of each
week.
Entertainments of all types are
exempt. The college has asked us,
however, that once again functions
be held in the first three days of each
week as far as possible. A meeting
will be held during the week at which
there will foe discussion as to how
it is possible to make as many events
as possible fall within the three per-
missible days. It is likely that an
efforts will be made to move the film
shows (both ents and film soc) to the
first three days of the week so, if
you are interested in the films, please
keep a careful watch out for notices
indicating when and where the films
are to be shown.
It is hoped that the concerts Will
not be affected. The ents committee
will be asked, however, to try and
minimise the amount of electricity
that they use at the concerts. Again,
look out for notices for any possible
cancellations.
