Once again we get to
the beginning of another
term, and it is part of my
job to write another
Purple Patch for Felix. I
cannot deny that after
the vacation it is very
difficult to think of inter-
esting news to tell you,
however, there are a
couple of items which I
think that you will be
happy to hear about.
The first bit of news
is that after the increase
in Refectory prices,
which was initiated at
the beginning of last
term, the latest informa-
tion is that the refecto-
ries are making a profit
. . . just! This profit is
realised on a turnover of
some £112,000. So, as
far as I, and also the col-
lege financial secretary,
can see, there is going
to be no need for a rise
in refectory prices in the
near future.
The next piece of
news which I should in-
form you about is that
there is a likelihood of
the college buying a
house in Queensbury
Place for use as a stu-
dent residence. This
house, it is thought,
will be able to cater for
some 30 students, and
will provide similar ac-
commodation to the stu-
dent houses. It is hoped
that the accommodation
will be available for oc-
cupation at the begin-
ning of next session.
Negotiations are at
the moment taking place
for the purchase of the
property, the majority of
the money coming from
the Voluntary levy which
the students in our Halls
and houses have been
paying for the past three
years. This levy has now
reached the grand total
of £56,000, indicating
the initial money collect-
ed has been very well in-
vested. What we hope
to do with this house is
to try to make it as near
as possible the ideal
type of student resi-
dence, and a committee
will be set up with stu-
dent representation to
deal with the design of
the property before the
students actually move
in. It is hoped that we
will be able to keep the
cost of accommodation
on a par with that in the
hails of residence and in
Student houses, and the
discipline in the house
will be kept by a student
warden, who will hope-
fully be elected either at
the end of this term or
at the beginning of next
term. So those of you
who are interested,
please begin thinking
about the job.
Most of you who were
here last year during the
election campaigns for
President and Hon. Sec-
retary, may have won-
dered what has happen-
ed to the ideas put for-
ward about the take-over
of the Union Bar and
Union refectory. Well,
sursprise, surprise, these
ideas have come back to
life, and you will hope-
fully be hearing more
about them as the term
goes on. As you may
well realise, there is
going to have to be a
great deal of thought and
effort put into this ope-
ration as we will need a
very convincing case in
order to persuade the
board of Governors that
we are capable of taking
over the areas and not
making a great loss.
The reason for the
takeover as many of you
may imagine is an effort
to show that we are
capable of managing our
affairs, and this includes
the catering side of the
Union building. What I
envisage as the basic
ideals of the takeover are
that there will be a
Union Manager who will
deal with the overall
management of the
Union and he will be re-
sponsible to a Union
committee. A s far as I
am concerned the take-
over will not tin 'itself
mean that the existing
staff will be required to
leave. Of course, if they
decide to leave and work
for Mr. Mooney, then
they shall be well within
their rights to do so, but
of course, I would rather
they did not.
As I said earlier, you
will be hearing more
about this later on in the
term, but in the mean-
time, if anyone is parti-
cularly interested in the
project then I would be
very grateful if they
would come to see me,
and maybe even offer a
little of their time to
help me with the neces-
sary survey of other col-
leges who have under-
taken this type of take-
over.
Last but by no means
least are the elections
which are coming up this
term. We should, by all
rights, be electing a Pre-
sident, Hon. Secretary
and also a Deputy Presi-
dent and another post to
be decided upon by the
Union. These elections
are vital to the future of
the Union, and I hope
that you will take them
seriously. As many of
you will remember, for
the past two years it has
been remarkably difficult
to elect any Union offi-
cers, and worst of all the
sabbatical posts. I would
implore any one of you
who has any aspirations
whatsover towards doing
any of the Union jobs
or the incredible Hon.
Sec./Editor of Felix/
Jack of all trades.
Welcome back, and I
hope that you had a nice
Xmas and may I wish
you all a Happy New
Year.
As you may have al-
ready noticed, the pre-
vious editor Alisthair
Campbell resigned at
the end of the last term.
On page 2 you will find
in full what Council de-
cided would happen. In
the meantime anyone in-
terested in the job of co-
ordinating the produc-
tion of Felix should con-
tact me in the Union Of-
fice. It is hoped that the
job will be made consi-
derably easier with the
editorial board.
As for this issue, I
must firstly apologise
for its condition. It was
literally thrown together
last Thursday and was
my first attempt after
having been literally
"thrown in at the deep
end" so to speak. I have
also, due to the Xmas
vacations, had to write
(or copy, as the case
may be) most of the ar-
ticles myself. Don't
complain about the
standard of reporting, if
you can do better, come
along and do so. Sec-
ondly, my thanks go to
Dave Sinclair, who filled
for next year to stand
for election. After all, the
worst thing that can hap-
pen to you is that you
can be elected. If anyone
would like to find out
more about the various
posts which are being
made vacant at the end
of this year, then all you
have to do is to come
along and ask the person
who is doing the job
now, and at least we will
in on the setting of the
paper, as I had to go for
an interview at the time.
Lastly, whilst I am in
charge of Felix, I am
hoping to introduce
some new, college orien-
tated articles. Firstly, if
they are submitted, I
hope to have a regular
page of articles from
various Union clubs and
societies. This would
be somewhat like the
sections in the Societies
Handbook with the ob-
vious advantage that
there would be space for
a much longer article. If
you think you'd like to
write an article about
your club captain or soc-
iety, please contact your
club captain or president.
Another new idea
(though not an original
one) is a regular prob-
lems column, "Aunty
Lucy". Details of this
are again on Page Two.
I would like to make
an appeal to Scaramanga
of Broadsheet fame, to
submit an article to me
for each edition. Any-
thing will be accepted,
so long as it can't be
construed as being libel-
lous. For ideas, please
refer to "Colcutt" in Fel-
ices of a few years ago,
available in the Union
Office.
Remember! This is
your paper, paid for out
of your Union funds. It
will only be value for
be able to tell you what
he should be doing!
The third sabbatical is
at the moment not fixed.
We have the money for
the post, but as we now
have no Felix Editor,
then that sabbatical is
not being used. If any-
one has any suggestions
as to the best use of this
sabbatical salary then
we would be glad to
hear it. The idea at the
money if it contains
what you want to read.
Also, the best way to en-
sure that it contains
what you want to read is
to submit articles. There-
fore, get writing and
make this a paper worth
reading again. You may
think that it .never was
worth reading. In the
Union Office there are
copies ranging back over
several years that will
show you that it was.
ELECTIONS
Yet again these amaz-
ing spectaculars are
nearly upon us. In the
calendar in this issue
you will find the dates
on which the nomination
papers will be put up,
and also the dates they
will be removed follow-
ed by the elections and
the results. If you wish
to stand for any of these
posts please watch out
for the nomination
papers.
COMPLACENCY
Last term the Union
suffered from the above
(better known as
apathy). Thought:— Do
you really want a Union
to act on your behalf,
put your views forward,
supply your money? Or
is everyone who believes
in the Union, who work
hard, mostly with little
or no encouragement,
wasting their time?
moment is to elect a sab-
batical Publications Of-
ficer, whose job would
be to deal With the
whole realm of publica-
tions of the Union, in-
cluding Felix, Phoenix,
and also Stoic.
I hope your term goes
well, and that you wiH
come forward with more
ideas that will be pos-
sible to put into action.
NORM.
SO YOU THINK YOU SPEAK PROPER?
With even eminent playwrights such
as E. Wise using phrases like, "With
talent like What I've got," one begins
to wonder how many people actually
speak 'Queen's English' these days.
We alii know that English is a bas-
tard language and, even though it
is the most widely used, 'is one of
the hardest to learn. The main rea-
son for this is its numerous strange
quirks, eg. bow and bough although
pronounced the same have different
spellings and meanings. The Ameri-
cans have not helped matters much
by changing the spelling of many of
our words, eg. color, sulfur, and
this type of inconsistency makes the
task of others learning our tongue
more difficult.
Apart from this, however, how
well do you think you have done
in (learning your mother tongue. You
have all obtained ' 0 ' level English
but exactly how literate are you. This
lis a short test to help you test your
knowledge and remember, you are
the most 'intelligent members of
society — think how lesser mortals
might get on.

How to score :
Give yourself :
3 points if you know the correct
answer
2 points 'if you guessed the correct
answer
1 point if you cheated.
0 points if you haven't the
'intelligence to cheat.
If you scored :
28-36 you are a master of the
English language and missing your
vocation. You should be a lexico-
grapher or crossword compiler.
20-28 you are competent at the
use of English and should be writing
articles for FELIX as you must be
able to do better than this.
12-20 well maybe you're not so
inteligent after all. You are probably
an engineer so why not try reading
something else for a Change.
0-12 no further comment (you
probably wouldn't understand it
anyway).
Less than 0—Sayles and Sinclair
I'm ashamed of you both!
