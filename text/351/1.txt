MEETING VOTES TO CONTINUE
A meeting of Hall and House residents, held on Sunday
evening, decided that the Rent Strike, called for this
term, should go ahead.
The meeting that had
about 130 interested
people present voted by
65 votes to 44 that in
their opinion the rent
strike should go on."
The meeting was op-
ened at around 8 p.m.
with Mr. Sayles 'in the
chair. This was later
passed to Mr. Wads-
worth when he arrived.
There was a very var-
ied and, at times, heated
discussion on all aspects
of the Rent Strike along
with other related and
semi-related issues.
In a speech against,
one member suggested,
that, as a show of
strength, we choose four
major roads into London
and cause a traffic jam
during the rush hour This
brought the house down
in a fit of laughter.
Norman Sayles ex-
plained how the Rector
TOW thought it unlikely,
I'm the present crisis, that
we would get any in-
crease at all.
Mr. Sinclair, deputy
president, gave a detail-
ed and weH thought out
speech against the Rent
Strike.
The debate was quite
active, ranging from well
known union figures such
as John Lane, John East,
Dave Osborne to people
who had never been
heard from before.
There was a tendency
for the discussion to
waver from its intended
course with brief discus-
sions about Dave Sin-
clair's preference to
'bum licking', sugges-
tions that all members
joined the Conservative
Party and numerous oth-
er amusing discourses.
It was finally decided
that a vote should be
held. After a final speech
for and against Mr. Sayl-
es summed up. The sum-
ming up speech was
simple yet forcefully put.
Before the vote the
Chairman, Mr. Wads-
worth, ruled out any fur-
ther speeches and also
separated the few non
residents that were pres-
ent.
As already shown, the
vote was in favour of a
Rent Strike continuing.
It. doesn't need an ex-
pert at mathematics to
realise that if the strike
is 100 per cent success-
ful then over £40,000
will be collected. Propor-
tionate involvement will,
of course, produce a pro-
portionately sized rent
fund.
A meeting of the
I.C.T.A. Executive Com-
mittee will be held as
soon as possible and
elections for the various
posts held. In the mean-
time, when you wish to
pay your cheques into
the fund then make them
payable to- the H.€«T.A
Rent Fund.
They will be accepted
by Paul Wadsworth,
Hon. Secretary I.C. Un-
ion, who will give you a
receipt and ask you to
fill an entry in a cash
book. Because of this, it
is necessary for you to
pay your cheques in in
person to Paul. When the
system is working it may
be possible to make the
transaction through the
Union Card.
If you wish to with-
draw your money before
the end of the term, then
please contact Paul
again. When the com-
mittee is elected, with-
drawals will only be pos-
sible with two or maybe
even three signatures.
This is to safeguard
against illegal wihdraw-
als of funds.
