MIKE IS BACK
A t the last Council of
last term there was a
somewhat noisy and un-
constitutional disturbance.
After a term of tricky and
d i f f i c u l t negotiations
David Sinclair (Deputy
President) finally secured
the return of M I K E ,
Imperial College's long
lost mascot. Its first show-
ing was at the aforesaid
meeting where all its
oattle scars were on dis-
play. The crescent of the
micrometer is now paint-
ed blue and there is an
inscription "Queen Mary
College 1971" on the bar-
rel. M r . Sinclair assured
Council, however, that
after a Q M C minion had
been made to unscrew
completely and then re-
screw M I K E (no mean
feat with a 30cm gap), he
was satisfied that the
screw thread was in good
working order.
It was necessary, due to
the fact that Q M C
"played dirty" and did
not have M I K E on dis-
play, to buy it back and it
is hoped to have some
fund raising activities to
cover the cost.
Although M I K E is now
locked safely away it
should be available for
viewing at some public
function or meeting and
from thence, eventually,
to go on "permanent" dis-
play again. This time the
security will be more
secure.
Anyone interested in
mascotry should contact
Wooden Horse Organisa-
tion, c/o David Sinclair.

X-COUNTRY
From the latest edition
, is Own Sporting
Life; Cross Country Cap-
ers, featuring Rob Allin-
son and his committee . . .
That Wednesday, after
Christmas Dinner in the
refectory, Rob Allinson
and his chums at the P
Consort Academy gath-
ered together for the
occasion of their Annual
'Andicap. Now Rob, who
had worked out all the
handicaps the day before
during Prep, announced
that he himself would not
be running. Amidst thun-
derous gasps of shocked
surprise it was revealed
that he was suffering from
the effects of the previous
evening's dormitory break-
fast. The amazement of
the group was further
compounded at the arrival
• f the day's transport.
For, there arriving in its
fall glory and splendour
was the most luxurious
and shining (nay, gleam-
ing even) minibus they
had seen the past three
months, (and hired from
Roland's Coach Curiosi-
ties too!), with actual
seats (!) and steering that
didn't pull to one side. So
stunned were they that the
journey to Petersham
was completed in silence
save for a few sneezes and
dazed remarks of "Eee!
Grand eh?". Many were
the looks of wonderment
on their faces, and Steve,
driving, was observed to
smile.
Let not those who were
so unfortunate as to miss
this occasion be forgotten;
for suffering under the
ministrations of Matron
in the Sanatorium were
nearly half of Rob's usual
followers, though Ian and
Alf had escaped through
the back window to come
to watch the race. Unfor-
tunately there was no
room on the minibus, and
besides their afflictions
were feared contagious, so
they were dispatched via
Green Line with Rob to
quarantine them from the
other passengers.
As to the race itself: 5^
miles is a long way, and it
was not without great
courage that Pete, Pad,
and Andy led the field off,
followed some two min-
utes later by Rob Maddi-
son with Mike and Dave
just behind and the rest of
the crowd several more
minutes later. Dave Jones
had two great advantages:
first, not having had any
Christmas dinner, and
second, a good handicap;
and spurred on by certain
remarks made by Mike to
the effect that he needed
someone to pace him, he
soon drew well away and
caught and passed Rob
Maddison at the Pimple,
and by further untold
efforts passed Pete in
Blacke Deathe, and Pad
and Andy at the Planta-
tion. Thus having attained
the lead he slowed down.
However his momentum
at this point was so great
that it carried him
through the Pen Ponds
and over the Hill to the
finish without anybody
catching him, though
Rich Harrington had
worked his way up
through the field and,
given a quarter mile more
would, no doubt, have
caught him. Behind Rich
was Pad and behind him
the rest of the gang, al-
most everyone finishing
within a minute. This
brought great acclaim to
Rob for his handicapping.
Pete was congratulated on
finishing last two years in
a row and was informed
that the object was to
really win.
That night there was an
official club beanfeast at
the Academy. When last
seen several of the newer
members ' of the gang
were observed to be rath-
er green about the gills.
The following day their
mysterious disappearance
was noted and the ques-
tion, "Will we ever see
them again?", heard.
