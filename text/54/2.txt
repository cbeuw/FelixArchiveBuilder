The O t h e r H a l f •
The celebrations at I.C. began at mid-day with the
conclusion of the rag meeting. Members of the R.C.S I n t e r -
planetary society invaded the tennis courts i n f u l l regalia
and with f u l l equipment to leave t h i s world - i n one way or
another. A f t e r several small rockets had been sent up to
warn the moon of i t s intended a r r i v a l , a large rocket was
set o f f . Unfortunately (or fortunately for the moon) there
was a difference of opinion inside the rocket as to which
way i t was going with the result that flaming missiles came
out i n a l l directions.
Due to the poor organisation of the rag ooimittee, about.
100 of I.C. gathered at Bedford College, which had been
chosen,by the rag committee, as worthy of attention. But the
rag committee altered i t s mind at the l a s t minute and went
to Q.B.C. About 300 had gathered outside Mines and set out
via Kensington High Street. Their progress was marked by
numerous explosions and by a r a i n of flour bags from one of
the buses carrying the ' good boys' to Harlington.
I n the High Street the mobile bon-fire took l i g h t and
the procession continued under a p a l l of smoke. By the time
Q.E.C. was reached, the f i r e was burring merrily and i t was
taken to the front entrance to the accompaniment of minor
and major explosions. After having l e f t notice of the v i s i t ,
the f i r e was pulled back to the gates where the a r r i v a l of'
the police discouraged further e f f o r t s , and the f i r e came
to a stop at the gates.
After some diversion had been created inside Q.E.C and
which resulted i n thegates being closed on the gentlemen i n
blue, the f i x e restarted i t s t r a v e l s . But not f o r long. With
a oar reversing furiously out of the way of the approaching
f i r e and with the polioe released, the truck chose to run
into the kerb. The p o l i c e 'arrested' the truck, and prevented
further motion by tying i t to a lamp-post. A f t e r a few more
skirmishes i t was decided to j o i n forces with the rest of the
university.
Progress to High Street (Ken.) was delayed by having to
pay some attention to a f i r e engine that had come along to
enjoy the I.C. f i r e i Whereas I.C. Union provided free transpoT
to Harlington, London Transport provided free transport i
to Charing Cross where d i f f i c u l t y was found i n getting the
t r a i n to r e s t a r t . This ccuLd not possibly have been due to
I.C. because by t h i s time the crowd were on t h e i r way out of
the station - over the top of the r a i l i n g s .
/ By t h i s time the numbers had grown and about 400 were
i n the procession which marched up V i l l i e r s Street and on to
Trafalgar Square. Due to the a c t i v i t i e s of c e r t a i n minor
colleges of the university, the police already had a: •
recaption committee - and I.C. marched straight into it.,
The a c t i v i t i e s of the gentlemen i n blue resulted i n a
scattering of the I.C. forces which reformed i n two main
groups. One waged battle from Trafalgar Square to P i c c a d i l l y
and back and ended with a chase underground at P i c c a d i l l y
Station. The other group closed the gates at the bottom of
The K a i l and then marched around Trafalgar Square u n t i l about
300 were i n the march and then set - out for Leicester Square
After a very noisy passage through Cockspur Street a bus load
of police arrived. I.C. declined the o f f e r of the police to
help with the procession and dispersed.
Several members of I.C. continued with the celebrations
by j o i n i n g i n the fun at Bow Street next morning. Here
B r i t i s h j u s t i c e was done i n a l l i t s fairness by dealing with
50 of the 183 charges i n 45 minutes - 0.9 minutes per charge.
