30th October, 1953.
Dear Sir,
In the editorial of the last "FELIX", you
refer to a letter frota Mr. Baty printed i n the
previous issue, relating to the arrangements for
breakfast i n the Refectory, and to a reply from
"somebody who Is connected with the running of
the Refectory".
I was the writer of the reply, and since ths
Chairman of the Catering Sub-Committee, Mr. J . F.
Levy, had not returned, to the College at the time,
l t oould hardly take the form of an o f f i c i a l
letter from the Bub-Committee to the Editor of
Felix. Furthermore, i t did not take any of the
forms suggested i n your editorial; i t was merely
a statement of facts whioh every well-informed
member of the Union should know. Publication i n
Felix would therefore be quite superfluous. It
said that the Refectory Committee consisted of
representatives of the Staff, I.C. Union and the
constituent College Unions, that i t was always
willing to consider reasonable suggestions, and
should Mr. Baty wish to submit such a suggestion
l t could be considered at the next meeting.
Had Mr. Baty or you, Sir, been of the opinion
that this was worthy of publication In your s
columns, i t would have been a simple matter to
have asked ray permission to do so. In fact, X
reoeived no acknowledgment whatsoever, and i t Is
therefore with some surprise that I observed that
F e l l s f e l t that i t had been more or less insulted.
It i e surely X, and the Catering Sub-Committee who
should feel insulted, since your editorial would
seem merely to be offensive and irresponsible,
without making a genuine effort to resolve this
u t t e r .
Tou taunt be aware, Sir, that the members of
the Catering Sub-Committee are always quite
aoeeealble and auproaeh&ble persons, and we there-
*A»e feel that an apology i s due to us.
Yourja faithfully,
F.S.Irving,
... The E d i t o r i a l was not presented as an ®gt®&%
to resolve the matter. I t merely said that any
lart-enra i n fklii should be replied to by letters
i n ISLXX. Since the letter to Mr. Baty was not
an • o f f i c i a l letter from the sub-Committee' we
f a i l to see why the sub-Committee should feel
insulted. We are indeed aware that i t s members
are apgroaohable persons, and hastgn to ada.
that ho suggestion to the contrary was intended.
. Regarding the problem i t s e l f , we w i l l glad-
ly print any suggestions reoeived. - Bd.
Sir,
Last year, FELIX boasted to be the only
U.If. College magazine unsubsidised by i t s
College Union.
Since, according to the I.e. accounts
-passed at the last Union meeting she received
a grant of £ 6 2 , oould this money he used i n
reducing the price of the magazine to 2d per
issue. . .
I t the union grants the same amount thia
year, we could have a "penny fortnightly" for
the rest of the academic year.
Yours etc.
B i l l Hudson.
. . . The "grant" i s taken i n order to pay
the printer i n advance for" the term and
•returned by fortnightly instalments to the
Union. " v
I.C. MISSION
During the next week, Nov. 15th to 22nd,
I.C. Christian Union i s holding a mission i n
the College to present the Christian faith and
itsVrelevance to university students. The
missioner, who w i l l be l i v i n g i n the Hostel, i s
Mr. Metcalf Collier - a business accountant
with considerable experience of the application
of Christianity to modern l i f e .
Two lectures w i l l be held each day, one at
lunchtime and the other at teatime. The lunch-
time lectures have been designed as a straight
forward explanation of the Christian message,
whereas the teatime lectures w i l l be ooncerned
Tith the logical and historical evidences of
the truth of Christianity. In addition to
these meetings, central mission services are
held on Sundays Nov. 15th and 22nd at

Dear Sir,
I was interested to read, i n your last
Issue, two highly c r i t i c a l letters referring,
lo the Rag Committee and I feel that answer
to tharu i s called for.
First of a l l I must protest against
Mr. Guthrie's references to the college masc>t.
The ma tter of size i s , of course, largely one •
of personal opinion, but, comparitively speak-
ing, Herbert i s well within the range of mascot
sises displayed by other colleges, and I do not
think that the biggest i s necessarily the best.
As to his procurement - "extremely tame"
Mr. Guthrie says. I am sure he has no idea
of" the amount of trouble which both directly
and indirectly, went into the obtaining of
Herbert. '
On top of a l l this, he seems to forget
that Herbert was unanimously and enthusiastic-
ally adopted by the Union last year, as their
mascot, and so hie remarks are an insult to
the Union as -much as to the people who put i n
so much time and work- on Herbert.
As to the other remarks I will only deal
with the formation of the Rag Committee.
There was great demand for such a body about,
this time last year and so i t was appointed
by Council, then under Ron Macfie, from those
who gave evidence of being actively interested
( i n the matter.
Yours faithfully,
Rag Committee Chairman.
Bear Sir, ,
Your correspondent. 'Watt.' must be an .

I.C. from such good old days as the bonfire rag
of a few years ago w i l l remember that, as f o r
