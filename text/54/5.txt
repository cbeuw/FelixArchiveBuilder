From our motoring correspondent
Boanerges once more upheld the honour o f
Guilds i n the Veteran Car run to Brighton,
which took place t h i s year on Sunday, 1st Nov.
Bo had undergone a f o r t n i g h t o f i n t e n s i v e
t r a i n i n g , which had revealed a number o f the
more obvious p e c u l i a r i t i e s o f both the engine
((for want o f a b e t t e r word) and the d r i a e r s .
These e c c e n t r i c i t i e s having been accomodated,
the Motor Club were q u i e t l y confident and
expected anything to happen.
A c c o r d i n g l y an entourage o f f i v e tender cars
and .a mobile workshop a r r i v e d at the Guilds e a r l y
on Sunday morning, i n r a i n whioh had o b v i o u s l y
set i n f o r the day. Some o f the p a r t y set to work
g i v i n g Bo a f i n a l p o l i s h , w h i l s t the h i e r a c h y o f
the Motor Club t i n k e r e d m y s t e r i o u s l y with the
i n t e r i o r . At l a s t a l l was ready, Bo was s t a r t e d
and with Mike Day at the wheel, aided and abet-
. t e d by Alan Woolaston, with the Motor d u b Pros
-ideirt, N. P.W.Moore Bsq. and the President o f
G u i l d * , Tony G i l l i n f u l l r e g a l i a on board, Bo
set m a j e s t i c a l l y o f f f o r Brighton..
A l l went w e l l u n t i l B r i x t o n H i l l was reached,
when signs of overheating l e d to an i n v e s t i g a -
t i o n o f the c o o l i n g system, which seemed at that
moment to be c h a r a c t e r i s e d by the complete
absence o f water. Your correspondent a r r i v e d i n
time to see a blackened hand appear from beneath
Bo and to hear a disembodied v o i e e c a l l f o r the
atsTongest s t r i n g a v a i l a b l e . A l o c a l i n h a b i t a n t
having been roused from h i s bed to provide f o r
Bo's t h i r s t , the p a r t y proceeded on i t s way. The
r e s t o f the outward t r i p proved uneventfiul,
although i n s p i t e o f the i n o r d i n a t e amount o f
r a i n , o c c a s i o n a l stops f o r water were necessary!
Bo's erew also appeared to be t h i r s t y , though i t
i s doubted whether the f l a s k from which they f o r
- t i f l e d themselves contained anything as tame as
water!
The route was l i n e d a l l the way with cheering
erowds, who had turned out, to see Guild's answer
to the new Pord. At Brighton, where Bo a r r i v e d
at 1.00pa winning another medal, the tornado had
swept away most o f the s p e c t a t o r s . With Mr.
Moore i n the c h a i r , the party had em enjoyable
l u n c h i n an h o t e l and Bo was s u i t a b l y f e t e d .
A f t e r lunch some o f the dryer members o f the
p a r t y ventured f o r t h f o r the parade. This was
however canceled, a f o r t u n a t e occurence s i n e * Bo
had a l r e a d y decided not; to go on i t .
The r e t u r n journey began soon a f t e r 4.00pm
with N i g e l Trotman at the wheel. Bo r e a l l y got
i n t o i t s s t r i d e end i t was remarked that i t was
going l i t e a bomb. U n f o r t u n a t e l y at Streatham the
boab want o * f - Bo had deelded to take the easy
way hone and refused to respond i n i t s usual way
to a t i c k l e i n the r i b e with the s t a r t i n g handle.
So Bo f i n i s h e d the journey 'on tow* and the p a r t y
)«YS&ved back at Guilds at 10.15pm v e r y t i r e d a£d
but i n good s p i r i t s . Another e p i c run wee

1-C. UNION MEETING
The meeting was h e l d i n a crowded and smog-
r i d d e n Gym.
Two i n t e r e s t i n g p o i n t s arose out of the e a r l y
r o u t i n e d i s c u s s i o n with regard to the b o o k s t a l l ;
one that the B o o k s t a l l should buy and s e l l
second-hand books, and a l s o that i t s premises
should be considerably expanded.
An o f f i c i a l proposal seeking to a u t o m a t i c a l l y
r e t u r n ex-members of the Executive to C o u n c i l
was soundly defea'ted, probably because of the
thought of what was to f o l l o w .
The l a s t and most c o n t r o v e r s i a l item was the
arrangements f o r Nov. 5th. The usual annual
appeal was made by the P r e s i d e n t f o r a l l l o y a l
I.C. students to be good c h i l d r e n and avoid
g e t t i n g themselves a r r e s t e d . The o f f i c i a l
arrangements f o r H a r l i n g t o n were given out with
two days n o t i c e only, which f a c t was regarded
with d i s s a t i s f a c t i o n by s e v e r a l speakers. The
announcement that the o f f i c i a l U. L. Rag had
been c a n c e l l e d by the P o l i c e was greeted by a
strange calm, due probably to l a c k of i n f o r m a t i o n
r e s u l t i n g i n a l a c k of i n t e r e s t . ( O u r r a g
committee was not represented at a meeting of
a l l r a g committees w i t h i n U.L. h e l d on Nov. 4th.)
The s i t u a t i o n was l e f t i n the u n s a t i s f a c t o r y
p o s i t i o n t h a t things would be d i f f e r e n t next
year, and that d i s c u s s i o n would take place with
ample time i n hand. We seem to have heard t h i s
a l l before, i n f a c t i t happens every year.
The general atmosphere of the meeting was
goodhumoured, although many people i n s i s t e d on
a n t i c i p a t i n g Guy Fawkes' Night; Most speakers
managed to make themselves heard, but were unable
to see each other through the cloud of smoke.
O f f i c i a l s of C o u n c i l could not be h e l d
r e s p o n s i b l e f o r the cloud of smoke, but they
could be h e l d r e s p o n s i b l e f o r the general
i n e f f i c i e n c y of the arrangements.
The l a c k of the usual c h a i r s and the r e s u l t a n t
p l a c i n g of t a b l e s h a l f way down the Gym must
have r e s u l t e d i n countless l o s t v o t e s .
ROCKET TRIALS AT R.C.S.
The R.C.S. Union Meeting l a s t week wa&
the n o i s i e s t and most s u c c e s s f u l , i n a way,
for a long time.
While Hon. Sec. Johnny Sherwood was stand-
ing reading the Minutes, a gentleman stood upon
the f l o o r and i n a voice l i k e Jove i n d i c a t e d
that, while Mr. Sherwood was speaking wonderful
prose and l u c i d , f l a s h i n g poetry, i t was time
f o r something e l s e . P u l l i n g out a oowhorn,
the gentleman (who s a i d h i s name waB George,
but whether t h i s was C h r i s t i a n , maiden or sur
we do not know) blew two sharp b l a s t s , and
c a l l e d "Ho, my merry men." Immediately there
burst i n from the back of the h a l l s e v e r a l
students c a r r y i n g a l a r g e crown, s e v e r a l f e e t
i n diameter and of e l l i p t i c a l s e c t i o n , which
they h e l d above Mr. Sherwood's head. Mr. George
explained that the crown had been taken at
considerable r i s k from the M a l l by the 29 Club.
I t now r e s t s among the other t r o p h i e s .
The new Vice P r e s i d e n t , Mr. Guthrie, took
h i s place among loud, cheering. The second
reading of a B i l l to change the C o n s t i t u t i o n of
R.C.S. was then heard, and c a r r i e d . Only a
t h i r d of the t o t a l R.C.S. vote i s now necessary
f o r a p r e s i d e n t i a l e l e c t i o n to be l e g a l .
P r e v i o u s l y , one h a l f was necessary, a t o t a l so
l a r g e that there has not been a l e g a l l y e l e c t e d
President i n l i v i n g memory.
A s t r a n g e l y dressed gentleman then stood
up, and s a i d that he was a member o f the R.C.S.
I n t e r p l a n e t a r y Society, and would l i k e to ask
permission f o r one of the members to address
the meeting. T h i s was r e a d i l y given, and
Mr. Lemin, s p o r t i n g a space-helmet which looked
r a t h e r l i k e a motor c y c l i n g hat with a baby T.V
a e r i a l on top, spoke.
Mr. Lemin asked the Union f o r a grant of
ten m i l l i o n pounds i n order that researoh might
be continued i n l i n e with the governments of
three w e l l known powers. To give point to
h i s argument, Mr. Lemitt demonstrated the R.C.S.
Mark I space rocket, which appeared to be hap-
hazard i n i t s d i r e c t i o n , f o r i t exploded
v i o l e n t l y and h i t the Vice P r e s i d e n t . The
appeal f o r f u r t h e r funds f o r researoh i n t o
d i r e c t i o n o o n t r o l was w e l l r e c e i v e d by the
Union, and the Hon. Sec. Tress. Dr. L l o y d , was,
,t? unserved to be l o o k i n g worried.
