Gabriela
in Brazil
Gabriela M G M
I believe that you should
nearly always go to a film with
an open mind. Having pre-
conceived ideas or knowledge
of the plot can often spoil a
film or its 'stunning' effect.
This film is nothoweveroneof
those cases.
The plot follows the, almost
soap opera type, story of a
small Brazilian town, llheus in
the 1920s. There is a colonial
power of Spanish upper class,
but the times are changing.
The start of promiscuity and
an insignificant sub-plot of
p o l i t i c a l u p h e a v a l a n d
murder. The town is made up
basically of 1) women who
spend all their time trying to
get the men, 2)the working
men like school teachers and
bar owners and 3) the
colonels who make uptherest
of the upper class men and
spend their time drinking in
the bar.
Life was simple in those
days. The only rule was that
the husband should always
kill his wife and lover when he
finds them together.
Marcello Mastroianni is the
bar owner (a well know
Spanish actor) who takes on
as his new cook Sonia Braga
who although unheard of here
is a famous Brazilian Sex
Symbol (although starting to
age). Their love is seathing
and intensely physical. There
is little of the mental torment
of love conveyed here.
The whole film however has
a strange pensive atmosphere
that conveys the romance yet
not the harsh violence of this
t y p i c a l B r a z i l i a n t o w n
(Glamour again). It is hard to
pin down this atmosphere but
it seems mainly due to the
music. Apart from one or two
songs the background music
( a l t h o u g h n o t a l w a y s
appropriate) is wonderful.
Bringing to mind films like
Death in Venice and Merry
Xmas Mr Lawrence where the
music does not seem to fit but
is so good that it adds to the
film in its own right. Antonio
C a r l o s J o b i n , a n o t h e r
Brazilian, wrote the music. His
song 'Girl from Ipanema'
might mean more to you I
don't know. Enjoyable, but I
know some people don't like
reading sub-titles take your
glasses.
FELIX
Dee C Lee: Don't Do It Baby
I thought 'Selina Wow Wow'
was brilliant, and when this
one came into the office, I was
hoping for more of the same.
Unfortunately though, the
record company has clearly
decided 'Selina' wasn't Funky
enough, and has released this
primarily as a club record. It'd
be great on the dance floor,
but for listening to ? Nah!
Kim Wilde: The Second Time
Composed and produced
by daddy — Marty Wilde —
Kim attempts to get back the
success 'Kids In America'
brought. The difference is,
that 'KIA' had a great tune,
infinite energy, and ok lyrics.
T h e Second Time' has none
of these. In fact, I suspect the
only people buying this will do
so purely for the picture
sleeve: incredible high heels!
The Alarm: The Chant
T h i s r e m i n d s me of
something else, but I can't
quite put my finger on it.
Maybe it's just one of those
great songs that sound 'old'
even before you've heard
them. I loved 'The Stand', but
since then, The Alarm have
produced very samey singles.
A n d how can anyone hope to
get a political message across
with words like 'Weialala lela,
wellala'?
Paul Young: I'm Gonna Tear
Your Playhouse Down
I have a soft spot for Paul
Young, having 'got into' his
music long before it was
trendy to do so. Also this new
single has my favourite PY
song —'Broken Man' — on the
flip of the 12 inch. However,
despite numerous listens, the
A—side fails to impress. His
voice is as excellent as ever,
but the song is basically duff.
Streetheart: Snow White.
Streetheart are a Canadian
H M band (so that's why you
haven't heard of them!!) who
are trying to break into the
B r i t i s h M u s i c S c e n e .
Unfortunately, they plan-to do
this by mellowing their rock,
and adding random 'Sha Na
Na's'. At least that's what it
seems like. Canadian rock has
a lot to offer. This is not it!
Quite often I ask for people's
comments on new titles.
Recently I have asked certain
m e m b e r s of the a d m i n -
istration staff. Their reactions
are enlightening. Top of the
list is 'Maia', ' H G Wells in love'
and of course, a certain pop-
up book, which can be kept in
my office for collection. I
wonder if one's reading likes
and dislikes should betaken
into account when recruiting
new staff?

Has anyone seen an internal
telephone? Five weeks ago at
great inconvenience to myself
and my staff, a cable was laid
b e t w e e n m y " o f f i c e a n d
Katherine Choi's office. She
deals with an e n o r m o u s
number of customer orders,
but as yet we haven't had a
phone connected. A s this
most excellent paper is read
by most, I wonder if one of
either our own telephone
engineers or BT's could help.

Gabriela-played by Sonia Braga-a well known Brazilian
Sex Symbol? Great music, but don't forget to take your
