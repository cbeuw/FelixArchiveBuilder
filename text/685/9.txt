Manor park—7 IC—5
When a team is still awaiting its
first win of the season, a visit to
Manor Park seems quite a
daunting prospect. However,
playing against one of the top
teams in the league IC produced
their best performance of the
season so far, just losing by the
odd frame in this best of 12 frame
match.
Ian Grindall, Jared Quereslin
and team captain, Michael
Powell each captured a frame
while, John West did particularly
well to win both of his frames in
this difficult away match.
Hopefully on the strength of
this performance that elusive
first victory of the season is just
around the corner.
WATER POLO
Draw with
Isleworth
Water Polo
IC vs Isleworth 5—5
IC vs Lloyds 5—6
The IC waterpolo team opened
this year with two good matches.
The score lines reflected close
contests with some great play
after a long summer lay off.
Against Isleworth, Imperial
opened the scoring. Four
quarters later two results were
rumoured, a 6—5 win and a 5—5
draw. The latter score was
official.
The match with Lloyds was a
fixture for the Freshers team. At
half time Imperial were 3—1
ahead. Lloyds however have a
reputation for making the most
out of a marine crisis and pulled
back to a 5—6 win.
This year there are plans to
put together an IC second team
for the middlesex league. Any
Fresher or would be polo player
coming to the training session
will be welcome to play, (water
polo and swimming 6.30
Mondays IC Sports Centre).

Sudbury
IC vs Surrey Univ 24.10.84
Last week's match was held at
Sudbury Golf Club, which has
accepted affiliation from Golfsoc
and will be the venue for
forthcoming society events.
Although a course of great
promise, not having too many
bushes to lose balls in it was
somewhat marred on Wed-
nesday by n e a r - m o n s o o n
conditions, which threatened to
turn the game into a test of who
could swim best with a set of
c l u b s r o u n d his n e c k .
Nevertheless, six foolhardy
fellows followed by a friendly
fourball fron. IC set out to do
battle. Despite a scorching 70
from one Mark Cox, the team
were sadly beaten 4—2, and will
therefore not qualify for the
Ryder Cup this year. The fate of
the fourball is unknown.

Losing trend
to reverse?
A m i d torrential rain and

the 1st XI hockey put up a fine

University, and lost, led by
captain Andy Stewart, who
demonstrated, an inability to
score at at penalty flick, the team
kept its season aggregate of
goals at one. The game was once
again marred by the lack of
umpires; a position which was
competantly filled by Morris in
the first half and Paule Lufkin in
the second. The latter, despite
his respiratory difficulties, did
especially well in disallowing two
Surrey goals. The Surrey umpire
was best summed up by Ian
Parker whose advice about the
purpose of a whistle was happily
cut short in time for him to avoid
an early shower. Surrey did
score two goals which were not
disallowed.

Hockey
IC vs Harrow Town Swans 4—4
Despite losing our goalie to the
2nd XI, and only managing to
field 10 men the thirds put in a lot
of effort to achieve a fair result.
Replacement keeper Vernon
Morris made some courageous
saves and was very well
supported (as ever) at the back
by capt Chris Harrison and guest
Mark Cubitt. All the forwards,
Marcus Shephard, Per Dillforce,
Tim Allen and Ian Mace, earned
themselves a goal each. Thanks
go to John the Swan for making
up the numbers.

IC Indoor Hockey vs Hamp-
stead, Hounslow, Eastcote
Having previously decided that
scores of 0—10 would probably
be quite respectable, the IC
indoor 'squad' left for Harlington
sports centre in a somewhat
nervous mood. The draw for the
national K.O. had not been very
kind, pitting us against 3 very
strong sides. The games proved
to be useful experience for a side
that had never played together.
The first game, vs hampstead,
was very tight in the first half with
college defending well; and saw
the sides level at 1—1 at half
time. In the second half the
opposition overwhelmed a
somewhat bedraggled defence to
finally win 5—1. The second
game, against the strongest of
the three sides (Hounslow), gave
an equally close first half with Phil
scoring a flick at one end and
another being saved at the other.
The start of the second half saw
college take a surprise 3—2 lead
only to be finally overcome by a
very experienced side 5—3. The
final game saw, perhaps, our only
chance of victory disappear in a
rash 2 minutes in the second half.
This allowed Eastcote a
somewhat unjustified victory of
7—4.
Many thanks to all nine for
turning out, and to Jim for
getting us there and back.

Colleges League Trophy at
H a m p s t e a d H e a t h . T h e
Northern duo of Graham
Harker from the Brendan Foster
Stable, and Gregor Booth the
last surviving Stirling Albion
supporter both performed well
on the soft ground to take 6th
and 13th respectively. The lads
packed 5 in 45 to take 2nd
position in the league and the
ladies should be well pleased to
be in the top half of the table with
only 3 IC runners competing
(please note).
Back to Hampstead Heath on
Saturday for a relay disorganised
by University College: After a
half hour delay whilst it was
explained in vague detail which
trees to run round, someone said
'go' and Jon Lea set off at
'cruzing' speed in eager
anticipation of the post race tea.
The tactic paid off as the rest of
the team missed out on
chocolate cake. Graham put up
one of the fastest times of the day
(a dangerous gamble in view of
the closeness of the track
season) and was rewarded with
four ladies team medals?
IC 1st XI Hockey
St Bernardo vs IC 2—1
Last Saturday, IC 1st XI were
unlucky to lose a hard fought
league game against St Bernard's
Hospital (away). IC conceded an
early goal but hit back
immediately when an excellent
run on the left wing produced a
chance for D Goft with which he
made no mistake . After this the
college played some fine hockey
but often came off second best in
s o m e s t r a n g e u m p i r i n g
decisions. Just before half-time
St Bernard's again went ahead.
The second half continued in
the same vein as the first with IC
playing skilful hockey which
usually ended with a less than
skilful tackles, ^'though the final
score was 2—1 the team played
well as a unit and the recent
trend of results will soon be
reversed.
