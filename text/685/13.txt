PRESIDENT'S REPORT TO UGM.
1. Commemoration Ball.
The numbers were slightly Up on last year and it appears that everyone
had a most enjoyable evening. There should be no cost to the Union for
this event. I would like to thank Eric Darbyshire, Hon. Sec, for his
work in organising this event.
2. House Wardens.
Within the next few weeks, interviews will be held for the Wardenships
at Holbein House, Southwell House and Mining House in Evelyn Gardens. I
will report back to the U
G
M once w
e are in a position to make the
appointments.
3. University Challenge.
At the time of writing, 12 students have been invited to take part in
the second elimination round, to be televised by STOIC. This will be
carried out on a "Mastermind" type basis. I shall report verbally on
how the selections are proceeding.
4. Permanent Staff.
Since m
y last reprot to a UGM, two more permanent staff have been
appointed. Mr. Tony Churchill is the new printer in the Union Print
Unit and Miss Diana Kramling has been appointed Catering Assistant. I
would like to thank Mrs. Kler who has held the post of Assistant since
the start of term and has now left. This now means that the Union is
back to its full complement of staff.
5. Union Snack Bar.
Although no definite figures are yet available, it seems that the Snack
Bar is working well and is not losing any money. I hope that those
people using it enjoy the range and type of food available - i f you have
any suggestions or complaints, please don't hesitate to tell the Manager
or one of the Sabbaticals. W
e can't make improvements or changes i f you
don't tell us!
6. College Refectories.
A Suggestions and Complaints scheme operates in each of the College
outlets, and there is a box in which to put your comments. Please use
this facility to register your comments and make sure that you sign and
date it. Mr. Mooney will personally reply to each sensible comment. In
addition, you can ask to see the Manager of the Refectory i f you have any
complaints.
