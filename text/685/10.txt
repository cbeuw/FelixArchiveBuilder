First
league win
IC Hockey 2nd XI vs Hampstead
Cricket Club.
IC—2 H C C — 0
Despite fielding in a weak side,
due to the absence of five regular
players, IC had their first league
win of the season at Harlington
on Saturday. During the first
half, despite consistent pressure
on the opposition's goal, IC
c o u l d not c o n v e r t their
opportunites and half-time came
with the score-line still at 0-0. The
captain, having forgotten the
oranges, did not have a chance
to give a team-talk and this
seemed to do the trick. The
college attack looked much
more threatening after the
interval and, after 15 mins of
further play, Jonathan Sturgess
lopped the ball over the keeper's
head and into the net. A second
goal come shortly afterwards
when Dave Whitton, who had
played superbly all match, put-
Sturgess clear for his second
goal. IC were then content to
slow the pace of the match down
and ensured victory with steady
play.
Special thanks goes to Jon
Harvey and Julian Westcott, two
very raw recruits, who turned up
at very short notice, enabling IC
to field a full side.

Hat trick
for Dent
IC 2nd XI vs Surrey (UAU) won
4—2
After losing the first U A U game
IC 2nd went all out to beat
Surrey. In a tough match Paul
Dent put us 1—0 up after a good
flick on by Pat Stamford. Surrey
equaled by a goal left foot shot
and then took the lead early in
the second half. Paul got a
brilliant 2nd goal as IC superior
fitness started to show. Pauls
hat-trick was completed after a
good strong challenge (foul) by
Pat split the defence. A late goal
by Martin from a good ball from
Kev left us 4—2 up. A great team
performance especially by the
defence.
RUGBY
IC Rugby 3rd XV vs St Thomas
14-4
This week IC completed the
whitewash with a stylish win over
the Medics third. A full
complement of fifteen men
travelled to Surrey with the first
X V and on a good afternoon
produced some rugby worthy of
their more illustrious colleagues.
Early pressure by St Thomas,
before IC settled in, resulted in
an unconverted try. But that was
the last time the opposition
threatened, even with a strong
wind at their backs.
Excellent handling by IC backs
in blustery conditions should
have produced a hatful of tries
however, tries by R Chirchin, M
Tester and S Turner (converting
his) were well deserved. A
scratch pack performed well
under pressure and a good game
was had by all.
IC Rugby at Harlington last Wednesday
BADMINTON
Shoe
Shortage
Mens II vs Kings College II
IC expected this to be a tough
fixture as the 'team' consisted of
drafted members of the third
team and others — the regulars
were seeking glory in the U A U .
Things started badly — only
five pairs of shoes between six
players, and the captain,
revelling in his new position of
power, tactically lost 2 games in
order to test his new players
under pressure. With the score
standing at Kings 4, Imperial 1,
the opposition captain left,
worrying about the problems of
b e i n g ' w i n n i n g ' c a p t a i n
(processing the score sheet etc).
As a friendly gesture, to save him
any trouble, IC won the
remaining 4 games to clinch the
fixture 5—4. With thanks to:
Dave Westland (capt), Henry
Lim, William Cheung, Raymond,
Stephen Thomas, Toong Por
Cheah.
SAILING
IC Ist—2 University of Essex—0
IC 2nd—2 Essex—0
This weekend, IC Sailing team
took the University of Essex and
their fleet of 420's by storm.
For the first race the teams
had to be towed to the race
ground. The tide being stronger
than the wind, the boats had little
choice over the course. After
some excellent tacking and some
dubious moves from Essex we
rounded the first mark. Howarth
and Bennet-Clark took the lead
and -due to excellent tactics
rapidly rounded the second
mark and drifted through the
finish line in 1st place.
The rest of the team followed
in 2nd and 3rd place. Baynes and
Bevan having sailed pastRobson
and Hill despite their problems in
rounding the 1st mark.
Essex were disheartened and
sailed our 2nd team. McCleans
vibrant sweater could, be seen at
the front of the fleet. But
Larkam's excellent trapeze
work took Larkham and
Brinelow into the lead. Again IC
won 123.
Two similar races followed and
IC romped home winning all the
races 123 — probably due to
Tosterins excellent tactics.
