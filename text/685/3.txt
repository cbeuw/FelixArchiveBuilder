End of
world nigh

T H E E N D O F T H E W O R L D IS
N I G H !
Don't miss the end of the world!
Will the great American public
choose to be led by a Walter or a
Ronnie? Will they make the right
choice? What is the right choice?
Is there one anyway? Who cares?
Well, not that I want to worry
you, but this Wednesday's party
could be the last party you ever
go to! It could be the last chance
you get to see Geno Washington!
It could climax in the most truly
apocalyptic pyrotechnic display
you have ever seen!
On the other hand, it might
just be the best party held in
College this year — but
remember — don't worry about
getting to bed late; Thursday
morning might never come! That
Hangover might not happen! So-
whatever you do, don't miss the
End of the World!
Supermicro
A n Orion Supermicro will be
used as part of a new course from
January 1985 to train final year
BSc and BEng students in
integrated circuit design. The
machine runs large F O R T R A N
programs and will be used to
simulate Computer-aided Design
(CAD) at various levels. C A D
techniques have been taught
theoretically for some time but
the subject can become more
practical, with simulation,
interactive design principles and
design verification being carried
out 'for real'.
The Orion is microprogram-
mable, that is, each assembly
language instruction is carried
out by a micropragram, which
can be altered by the user.
R e p r o g r a m m i n g on this
fundamental level allows for
more efficient processing in
applications where requirements
may change — especially useful
in research environments.
Around two thirds of the Orions
in use are in University
departments.
Red Ken
Faces were even redder than
usual at the Socialist Society
meeting last Tuesday lunchtime
when Ken Livingstone failed to
arrive to talk to a packed Great
Hall. Apparently he had been
held up at work and was feeling
unwell. He sent his apologies and
it is not know whether he will be
talking at College in the future.

Two IC
profs
honoured
Two IC professors have been
honoured by learned societies,
recently.
Professor Charles Rees of the
Organic Chemistry Department
has been invited by the German
Chemical Society to give the
Hofmann lectures for 1985. This
commemorates the pioneering
work of Hofmann, who was the
first Professor of Chemistry in
the Royal College of Science
from 1845 to 1865.
The lectures next year will be
given in Berlin, Darmstadt and
Giessen.
Professor J T Stuart, Head of
the Maths Department, has been
awarded the Whitehead Prize of
the L o n d o n M a t h e m a t i c a l
Society.
Careers Fair a success
The organisers of Wednesday's Careers Fair judged it to be a success.
Over sixty companies were present and the general impression was that there wer
jobs on offer than in previous years.
Careers Fair is organised by IC Industrial Society in collaboration with the Care
Department.
