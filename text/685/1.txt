Sir Henry
slams Rector
Parts of the Rector's Commemoration Day Speech were
attacked by the Chairman of the Governing Body, the Hon
Sir Henry Fisher in his closing speech.
The main points of the
Rector's speech were the hopes of
early implementation of A S -
levels designed to broaden the A-
level curriculum, and the entry of
more women into Science and
engineering. Sir Henry had
' g r a v e m i s g i v i n g s a b o u t
broadening the sixth form
curriculum'. Although it was
popular to talk about wide
ranging studies in the arts and the
sciences, he thought that the
current A-Level system provided
students who were 'well prepared
for a university course of only
three years'. He felt that any
change in the system would be a
disaster if they provided ill
p r e p a r e d s t u d e n t s a n d
universities had to bring them up
to standard.
Turning to the entry of more
women into science and
engineering, Sir Henry felt that
the Rector was emphasising the
recruitment in a way that was
itself sexist. Sir Henry suggested
that the way to attract women
was not to treat them as women
but, in the same way as men, as
human beings. He felt that a
good way of implementing this
change m i g h t b e g i n at
Commemoration Day itself. At
present when students are
presented to him the chairman of
the Governing Body nods his
head to men and raises his hat to
women. Sir Henry wondered
how long this tradition would
continue.
The Rector had no comment to
make on Sir Henry's speech.

engineering projects as well as a
range of smaller ones will be
discussed. Their funding will be
analysed as well as the way they
can be carried out to make a
contribution to the U K economy.
The keynote speaker will be
Norman Lamont M P , Minister

GowerStreetSquat
University students squatting in a
disused University of London
Examination Office building as
they have nowhere- else to live,
are protesting about the lack of
accommodation provided by the
University.
Fifty students, mainly from
LSE and U C L moved into the
building in Gower Street on
October 16, using an open
window. The building had been
vacant since last December, but
was c a r p e t e d and w e l l -
maintained. Owned by the
University, negotiations were
underway to sell or rent it out.
The University, although
sympathetic to accommodation
problems in general, have denied
that the situation is any worse
than in past years. Following
discussions with the colleges and
unions concerned as well as
students involved in the squat,
the University has agreed to a
joint enquiry with U L U . This will
look at accommodation in a
wider context and will present a
report to the Department of
Education and Science. A
Spokesman for the University
said that the Colleges concerned
had already offered short-term
emergency accommodation to
the students in addition to
counselling and help in finding
permanent accommodation. He
stressed that although legal
action was a possibility there was
no deadline by which the
students should leave the squat.
In a Press Statement, the
squatters claim the occupation to
be a 'needs issue', and not
politically motivated. Smaller
rooms would be used for long
term accommodation, and larger
offices (600 sq ft) as a short term
crash pad. They also intend to
run an accommodation advice
bureau. The occupation has
already been given unanimous
support at L S E and U C L Union
Meetings and a lobby of Senate
House took place on Wed-
nesday. The Squatters would
welcome student support,
especially in occupying the
building during the day. The
squat is at 66 to 72 Gower Street,
near Dillons.
An IC contingent attended the C N D rally at Barrow-in-Furness over the
weekend.
The 20,000 C N D supporters were protesting at the government's plans
to build the new generation of nuclear submarines at the Vickers yard,
which provides employment for nearly one in five of the town's
population.
