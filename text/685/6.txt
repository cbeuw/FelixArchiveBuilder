EFELIX:
ByB.B.Wblffe
Hello folks, I'm back. After a lengthy
absence Mr Rowe has decided to put me in
charge of scandal, expose and slander again.
So watch it, all duffers. What B B Wolffe
doesn't know about you isn't worth knowing.
Old Fart
Richard Williams, the Haldane Librarian, is
fast earning the title of 'most hated man at
I C \
Williams seems to take the view that
readers are an encumberance sent to
interrupt his 'historical' researches. His
colleagues have tried repeatedly to get rid of
him; on one occasion he was farmed off to a
departmental library but had to be sent back
after protests from the Head of Department.
Subsequently he was sent off to a number
of distant library conferences, only to create
such a bad impression that the organisers
refused to have him back.
So it looks as if we're stuck with Williams
in the Haldane. Fortunately we can rely on
his pleasant and hard-working staff to serve
us properly.
Chinks in the armour
It is not often that there is public
disagreement between those at the top of the
College hierarchy.
How surprising it was, though, to see the
veneer crack at Commem Day when the
Honourable Sir Henry Fisher, Chairman of
the Board of Governors, made an
impromptu speech criticising everything that
the Rector, Lord Flowers, had just said.
Flowers, known to his staff as 'Bean', had
no comment to make about Sir Henry's
behaviour!
Hippo
Another amusing incident at Commem Day
concerned Jo Claydon, who had the
prestigous job of leading the Rector's
procession on to the stage.
Unfortunately one of Hippo's shoes got
stuck in a grating as she walked on to the
stage.
With great presence of mind she continued
barefoot, and collected her shoes on the way
back.
Lady Flowers found the whole thing most
amusing. ' A jolly good job it wasn't your
knickers, deary,' she said!
Sloth
Hon Sees aren't traditionally very hard
working — but Eric Darbyshire really takes
the biscuit.
Eric gets in the Union Office at about
12.30pm most days. After lunch, which
usually ends at about 2 or 3pm, he does a bit
of Gestetnering.
By 3.30pm he's so knackered he has to
retire to his plush office, with girlfriend in
tow, in order to discuss 'Union Affairs'.
The day ends with a few gallons of beer
down at the 'Trough and Bucket', and then
it's back to hibernation.
PS A l l loony, Sherfield/Union nonsense
gratefully received. Send gossip to the Felix
Office marked 'B B Wolffe'.
The following people have been allocated parking permits on appeal. They should
collect their permits from the Union Office as soon as possible. A large number of
barrier cards remain unreturned; the Hon Sec would like them back.
