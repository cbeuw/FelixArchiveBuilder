motion defeated
at ULU GUC
SERC
revises
rules
The Science and Engineering
Research Council (SERC) the
b o d y t h a t f u n d s m u c h
postgraduate research, has
revised its research grant
conditions.
The main changes are that any
assistant on an SERC project
may now use travel funds from
the grants, and that expenditure
on equipment and consumables
during the final six months of the
grant will not, in general now be
accepted.
In addition, it has been decided
that the SERC approval must be
obtained before equipment can
be used by anyone other than the
investigator or his departmental
colleagues.
The 1984 S E R C Grants
Booklet is available from the
Research Contracts Office,
Sherfield.

A motion supporting IC's
attempt to make the University
of London award MEng degrees
for four year engineering courses
was defeated at General Union
Council (GUC) last Monday.
G U C is the souverign body of
the University of London Union
and decides U L U policy and
funding. Each college within the
university has a number of
delegates on G U C .
The motion, which was
proposed by Imperial College,
was designed to mandate U L U
representives of University of
London Committees to support
the efforts of Imperial and Queen
M a r y ' s Colleges for the
introduction of the MEng award.
External Affairs Officer, Jo
Claydon, proposed the motion

and explained that many
engineering students did the
equivalent of a normal three year'
course with a extra year of
management science. She then
explained how originally BEng
had only been used by
universities as an award for
students who hah done a four
year course but institutions now
awarded BEng degrees to
students on three year courses.
Bath University and Liverpool
Polytechnic, she added, already
award MEng degrees to people
on four year courses.
Representatives of Birkbeck
college and the Institute of
Education opposed the motion
saying that it was an attempt by
IC to set up an elitist engineering
college. On a vote the motion was
defeated.

Every year all the College's
accounts, including the Union's,
are drawn up by accountants in
the Sherfield Building for
presentation to the external
auditors. This year there has been
a long delay in preparing the
accounts, so much so that they
may not all be back from the
auditors in time for the meeting
next week of the Finance and
Executive Committees of the
Governing Body, which makes
the ultimate decisions on
spending in the College.
Particular inconvenience is being
caused to the Union since the
effect of the mistake made by last
y e a r ' s D e p u t y P r e s i d e n t
Christine Teller in assuming the
Union's income would be £6500
more than it will be, cannot be
assessed until it is known how
much money is left from last
year.
The man responsible for
drawing up the Union's accounts
is Ray Taverner, who is certainly
not adding to his popularity in
the College administration by the
current delay. His standing is
pretty low already following his
inept 'leaking' of 'scandal' to last
year's F E L I X Editor Pallab
Ghosh. M r Ghosh printed nearly
a page of obscure ramblings
claiming that the College had no
idea how to do accounting and
critizing senior College officials.
This resulted in a specially
convened 'Star C h a m b e r '
meeting of financial staff and
John Smith, College Secretary, at
which M r Smith, knowing full
well who the culprit was,
suggested to the meeting that
'one of us has been very silly' and
invited the offender to own up
now or 'come and see me later'.
Whilst on the subject of Ray
Taverner and Christine Teller, it
really is surprising that Christine
made such a cock-up with the
estimates, considering the 'close
working relationship' she had
established with M r Taverner.
They were often to be seen
drinking together in the Union
Bar before retiring somewhere
more private to 'discuss' the finer
points of the 'accounts'. Ray
Taverner is 45 if he's a day.
