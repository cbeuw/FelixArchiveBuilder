Clubs FELIX, Friday November 7th 1986 17
Hockey
Thirds Storm
to Victory
The 3rds stormed to their first
victory of the season. The Captain,
'Dick' Ellis once -again drew the
short straw and attempted to guard
the goal. Andrew Winterton played
magnificently throughout the whole
game, showing his majestic skill,
(guess who wrote this) and rounded
off a brilliant first half by setting up
Oz, who walked the ball into the
back of the goal.
After finally deciding that the star
of the 1st half, Nigel Brown, had to
umpire the 2nd half, IC set off to
build up their lead. Craig Honeybun
lived up to his name and stuck to the
ball. 'Leave' Roberts left the ball
alone a lot. Harry lived up to his
name by harrying the opposition
and scoring the second goal
brilliantly. Ian Knox lived up to his
name by knocking the ball around a
lot. Dick lived up to his name
All in all it was a triumph of good
over evil as the 3rds showed their
true form which had been lacking
during October.
Mixed win
In the second of the two mixed
matches Imperial beat LSE in a
close and enjoyable match played in
a friendly spirit.
IC opened the scoring through
Alan Cole, following a pinpoint 3
yards pass from Brendan Farmer in
a well worked move. LSE equalized
in the second half with a 'slightly'
lifted shot which astounded
goalkeeper Richard Ellis, and the
rest of the team.
Imperial clinched the match with
a goal from Jon Stonham, with an
excellent solid effort, after picking
up a throughball from the left.
Thanks to Ann Jackson for
playing for the opposition (pity she
had such a good game), Sally
Mullen and Duncan Fitter for
playing at very short notice, and
Justin Brooking for umpiring.
Yet more Hockey
Scratch Team
Despite looking like a motorway
maintenance crew and playing
hockey like one this scratch team of
geriatrics, cripples, and incompe-
tants put up a creditable
performance against an obviously
well rehearsed team of Slavs.
The game got off to a slow start
with most people cursing the beer
from Saturday night and learning
each others' names. However Dave
'Killer' Jennings soon found his old
touch and was again inciting the
opposition into acts of violence. He,
along with the other inside forwards
Gary 'No name' Knaresborough
and John '49 to go' Spencer made
many daring runs inyo the
opposition's half but always seemed
to run out of steam as soon as they
got into the D . Thanks to some
good backing up from the halves
Pippa Allen, Grunt 'no. 3' Wood
and in particular Sarah Hodgson
the pressure was kept up and
rewarded with many short corners
which posed no threat whatsoever
to the opposition. However at this
point the elder statesman of the
team Paul 'third time lucky'
Henharen stepped in and showed us
how to score from a penalty corner
i.e. with great perseverance.
In the second half the wingers
took up the running with Lisa
Funney and Sarah Wood - Perry
supplying many excellent crosses.
However SEES put on a late surge
which was dealt with competently
by backs Justin 'Bullet' Brooking
and Lorna Stoodley and goalie
James T got rythmn' Whitelaw,
however, in the dying minutes they
scored a fortunate goal from a short
corner, which caught all of I.C. on
the wrong foot.
/ have been trying to present the sports reports in a more
interesting format than in recent years, in order to create the
impression of a proper sports page. This, I hoped, would make
the reports easier to read and encourage better writing. Most
submissions are still of an appalling standard. Reports should
always be written in the third person, and should emphasise
the most important features of the game. References to "what
happened in the bar" should be kept to a minimum, and the
forename-'nickname'-surname format avoided at all times. I do
not wish to discourage teams from writing reports, but I am
not going to print drivel; anything of the standard of the
hockey article immediately above this will be discarded
immediately in future. I will be happy to give further advice on
writing reports to anyone who is interested.

Balloon
Flying in Oxford
Last Friday night Balloon Club
went up to Oxford for a weekend's
flying. Unfortunately it rained
nearly all day on Saturday—
specially unfortunate for those of us
who were camping!-So flying was
out of the question. Instead we had a
days sightseeing and shopping in
Oxford. In a desperate effort to get
out of the rain the Club Chairman
and Pilot went to see "Bambie",
though we never found out if they
cried in the sad bits!
Sunday was a lovely dry, clear day
so after an early start we inflated the
balloon and the Pilot Mike
Carpenter set off with Richard
Watkins and Andy Smith as
passengers. They flew for about an
hour and then accidentally landed in
a crop field. After placating a
slightly angry farmer the balloon
took off again, this time with Jenny
Lewis and Andy Mears as
passengers. They had a slightly
more staightforward landing and
then we adjourned to the pub for
lunch.
In the afternoon we fitted in one
more flight with Markus Mueller
training to pilot and Phil Strong as a
passenger. Unlike one of the other
balloon teams they managed to
avoid landing in a field full of
inquisitive cows. Finally, in the early
evening we made our weary and
muddy way back to London after a
weekend in the countryside which,
even for the few of us who didn't fly,
was really good fun.
Rag
Guilds Rag
Rag week approaches. The time of
year when pockets are emptied,
stomachs filled, and problem sheets
put aside.
As a special service to anyone
who enjoys a good giggle (or a good
gig) here are details of the first two
Guilds events of Rag Week
1986—Carnvial and the start of Hit
Squadding.
Carnival this year Features the
powerful Drum Theatre, in what
may well be one of their last gigs
played in this size of venue before
they move onto bigger things. Pink
Peg Show are for those who fancy a
bop, with their blasting renditions of
rockabilly songs about getting
drunk and eating. Brother Brother
offer a good mix of pop and funk,
with the mighty Swanjacks finishing
off a "something for everyone" line
up.
There will also be cabaret with
Kevin Day (fresh from The Comedy
Store) and Belinda Blanchard,
described by TNT magazine as
"somewhere between an over-sexed
Pam Ayres and John Cooper
Clark" so don't complain if it's a
little naughty.
There'll also be a bar-b-q, late
discos, and the bar will be open until
2.00 pm. If you don't have fun at
Carnival you won't have fun
anywhere.
