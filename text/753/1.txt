Tie Clubs Beat UGM
Ban by 23 Votes
Imperial College tie clubs, Chaps,
Links and 22, will be able to continue
using Union Rooms, after a motion to
ban them at Tuesday's Union General
Meeting was narrowly defeated. On a
paper ballot 128 students were in
favour of a ban on the three CCU-
based clubs, and 151 were against.
The U G M was one of the best
attended for several months, and
early speculation that quorum
would be challenged before two
major motions were debated was
not realised. The "motion on
improving the Image of Imperial",
which concerned the three tie clubs,
had been submitted as an emergency
motion late last week (See FELIX
752). The chief objection to the
clubs' use of ICU facilities was that
no women had been admitted to any
of them since they were founded
over fifty years ago. The 22 club
constitution specifically denies
women entry, though Chaps and
Links clubs do not have formalised
entry requirements. Each of the
clubs has an elected membership.
Proposing the motion, Jane
Spiegel of Geology II argued that
the three clubs were detrimental to
the image of Imperial College, and
that they were a discouragement to
prospective women students from
coming to Imperial. She said that
she did not consider elected
membership clubs to be
unacceptable, but stressed that there
was no reason excluding women
from such clubs.
Speaking against the motion,
ICU Hon Sec David Colley, a
member of Chaps Club, said that
the clubs put a large amount of work
into the running of IC Union,
describing the members as "doing
the donkey work". He added that
the members of the clubs were an
important source of income for the
Union, and that "money had to be
taken into consideration". He said
that the clubs had been placed in an
impossible position, since it would
appear to be a token gesture.
ICU President Christine Taig
then spoke seconding the motion.
She said that she had not intended to
speak, but wished to present the
other point of view from within the
ICU Executive. Miss Taig described
the existence of the clubs as an
anachronism and said that ICU
ought to come into the 80's. She
took particular exception to Mr.
Colley's remark that Links, Chaps
and 22 "ran the Union", and cited
several examples of women students
who also had contributed
enormously to ICU.
Links Hon Sec Roger Wilson said
that it would do more harm than
good to ban the clubs from Union
Rooms, and that Links had done an
immense amount for Guilds Union
and for ICU. He said that women
had been proposed recently for
membership of Links, adding that a
ban of one of Union rooms was not
going to promote the case of women
within the clubs.
During questions from the floor
External Affairs Officer Mr. Mark
Cottle described much of Mr.
Colley's arguments as "bollocks",
and thought that the recognised
"old boy" institutions RCSA,
RSMA and the Old Centralians
provided more support for ICU and
the constituent College Unions.
Postgraduate Affairs Officer Gareth
Fish felt it was significant that the
LSE, well' known as a college with
more left-wing students, supported
both all-male and all-female clubs.
Grenville Manuel pointed out that
the clubs would be good targets for a
national newspaper interested in
writing about "institutionalised
sexism within British Universities."
The debate moved directly to a
paper ballot after a procedural
motion to move straight to the vote.
The motion was defeated by 23
votes.
Fire Engine Runs
Out Of Steam
Boanerges, the moterised mascot of
City and Guilds College, succesfully
made it to Brighton last Sunday in
the annual Brighton run. Jezebel,
RCSU's veteran fire engine was less
fortunate, however, and broke
down less than two hours after
leaving South Kensington, when the
magneto developed a fault. Whilst
Jez was under repair in a car park in
Hooley, it was struck by a car
towing a caravan, and sustained
damage to the ladder supports,
though the ladder itself was
undamaged. Remonstrations
ensued with the driver of the car,
during which some senior members
of R C S U Motor Club are
understood to have sworn
vehemently. As this occurred in
front of his wife and children, the
driver reported the incident to the
police. Shortly afterwards the
RCSU members were questioned
briefly by police, but later allowed to
move on, when the driver of the car
was persuaded that the perpetrater
of the foul language had already left
on the accompanying van.
In total the outward journey took
7 and a half hours, due chiefly to
severe traffic jams. The return
journey was a comparatively swift 4
and a half hours.
