Felix FELIX, Friday November 7th 1986 9
The most raucous twelve days of the
College year. It's
Rag
Week
But is booze, bopping and having
fun the real excuse for Rag Week? In
the end, what have you as a
supporter actually done? Was it just
another party? Questions like these
attack the very fundamental reasons
for Rag Week; reasons which
sometimes are taken for granted.
The charities benefit from our
support which this year are:-
• The British Institute for Brain
Injured Children
• R A D A R
• Imperial Cancer Research Fund
• The National Deaf Children's
Society
• The Rectory Paddock School
for the Mentally Handicapped
Each charity has its merits, but
the main theme for this year is that
we are supporting the more
humanly related charities: charities
which deal with people and
children. Fundraising is difficult —
indeed fundraising organisers must
have the committment and
enthusiasm to face disappointments
as they occur. So, enjoy Rag Week
1986, and while you're out enjoying
yourself, spare a thought to the real
reason for Rag Week; the people
you're supporting and the good that
will come to them. The real credit
ultimately lies on people like you.
We cannot eradicate the nasties of
life but at least we can try to alleviate
the problems of someone less
fortunate than ourselves.
H a v i n g said that, now
concentrate on the way we intend to
raise the money, and make you
enjoy it too. It encompasses events
as wide and varied as your own
imagination: from parties to
comedy acts, boat races (both
kinds), street-collecting and
throwing dustbin rubbish at each
other. Some events involve money,
some involve just plain fun and a
supply of asprins. Don't let me put
you off, but ssh! Rag Week 1986 is
definitely here!
