Sabbaticals. FELIX, Friday November 7th 1986
President's Piece
UGM
This piece of prose will probably
be completely incoherent and
unintelligible. Why? Because I am
still in a state of shock after a
quorate and successful U G M . The
shock probably accounts for the fact
that I was Rather Nasty to all the
people who left before the reports. I
was enjoying myself so much I
didn't realise it was 2.30 and people
had lectures and labs to go to. Please
accept my grovelling apologies; and
if anyone wants to ask me about my
report, feel free to come and do so.
G e n e r a l l y , it was very
encouraging to see that we can have
a reasonable debate and a close vote
on issues both inside and "outside"
College. I hope the rest of this year's
UGM's are as good.
Union Office
If you've tried to visit the office in
the morning this week you'll have
found that the door was locked.
Unfortunately we've had to keep the
office shut until 11am due to the
amount of administrative work to
get through. This is partially due to
the backlog caused by Jen and Pat
having to take weeks off
unexpectedly. However we may
have to carry on with this
arrangement because of the
increased workload on the staff and
sabbaticals since the Union took on
the bar. Please bear with us while we
get things sorted out.
It appears that the time has come
to consider re-organising the Union;
redistributing the work between the
officers and possibly taking on a
new sabbatical or member of staff.
Anyone who wants to join in
discussions about the re-
organisations options, let me know.
I'd like to get a firm proposal
together by the end of January.
Union Bar and Lounge Bar
By the time you read this the new
music system will be installed in the
Lounge Bar. Bring your own
compilation tapes along and listen
while you eat and drink.
There are now "happy hours",
with a beer at reduced price,
between 7.00 and 8.30 every
Tuesday and Thursday in the Union
Bar.
There's a band—'Reynard's
Gauntlet'—playing in the Lounge
Bar tomorrow night; and there's still
time to enter a team from your
departmental year for the Darts
Contest (eight people including at
least one woman). See Kevin in the
Union bar for details.
Human Rights Week
Thanks to everyone who
organised or took part in Human
Rights week events, especially
Simon Bosher and Mark Cottle.
HRW is a wonderful idea; I hope it
will continue to expand over the
coming years. By the way, the
collection for Amnesty Inter-
national at Tuesday's U G M raised
about £50.
Complaint
Whoever damaged the TV in the
Lounge Bar I hope you're proud of
yourself. Next time maybe you'll
electrocute yourself in the process.

U G M Sketch
Surprise followed surprise at
Tuesday's U G M , with the first
major one being the turnout of 300
plus — a quorate meeting. The
audience may have dared to be
different, but they only seemed to
want to dare until 2.30 when the labs
opened again with the first
procedural motion from Douglas
Earl who wanted to get the motions
over with because he wanted to
leave early. And so the reports were
shuffled back out of sight as the
circus rolled onto its first
confrontation.
Afraid that Simon Bosher might
have to make a speech, the first
motion of the day on adopting Ivan
Starovoit as IC's own prisoner was
passed without discussion. A sigh of
relief was breathed until the
infamous 'Tie Clubs Motion'
brought out a rash of extreme
hyperbole. Hon Sec Dave Colley
made the first gaff of the day as he
defended 22, Links and Chaps with
the surprising revelation that these
clubs ran the Union contrary to the
general impression that it is in fact
run by the Exec. The unfortunate
Gutman was sent to bed without
supper by Christine and Jackie for
that one. Gareth Fish seemed to be
under the impression that because
the somewhat 'left of centre' LSE
had single sex tie-clubs, it was
alright for IC. In the meantime the
proponents of the motion seemed to
be more concerned with how the
system would look in the Guardian
than in the real merits of enforcing
the admission of women into the
clubs.
With the defeat of that motion,
came that old chestnut, the Barclays
Motion. Nervous eyes surveyed the
territory, making sure that the
magic 300 was still there, as Shaun
Dunlop launched into reiterating
the content of the motion at great
length. A curious time dilation effect
came into play at this point, causing
the supposed two-minute long
speeches to be stretched out to five
or more. It was fortunate that the
motion was not written with a
impenetrable Newcastle accent
itself. The motion was countered at
equal length by John Martin, trying
to score social awareness points by
wearing a Solidarnosc tee-shirt but
his awareness failed significantly
with the line "Barclays National has
no financial connection with
Barclays Bank."
Once that motion had been
defeated the audience suddenly
realised that it was time for lectures
to begin again. The various
members of the front table tried to
shout out that there were still
exciting things like the reports and
ratifying some elections. Somehow
that did not seem to compete with
problem sheets and they alll filed
out, to leave a few diehards behind.
Christine had a moan at people who
didn't care what she did in afitof
subtlety then apologised after
realising what time it was. And so
with the shattered remains of an
audience the second U G M finally
faded away with the vow to do all
the elections properly next time,
when there were a few more people
left.
