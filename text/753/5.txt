The State Of
The Union
RCS President Simon Singh
discusses how IC has changed in
recent years and looks at the current
state of the Union
I was a pre-punk kid. All of final
year students at I.C. are a result of
the naff macho glam-rock era ofthe
early and mid-seventies. We lack
style and sophistication, and yet we
possess all the qualities that our
child-hood heroes preached.
This year's Freshers are derived
from a different cultural source.
They grew up under the influence of
the New Romantics, the Gender
Benders, and the post-punk
politicians. Male rock stars no
longer conformed to the masculine
norms but were rather more
diminutive in stature and less
agressive in attitude. Posturing and
gesturing was replaced by
postulation and gesticulation.
What's all this got to do with the
state of the Unions? Let's take our
illustrious college back to the
halcyon days of 1975. The college
and the RSM were perfect for
keeping the students happy. There is
nothing like the atmosphere when a
dozen guys have worked all
morning to get Jez into a fit state
and then go on a trip out. The air is
thick with bravado and the unity
and the comradeship evoked is
something special.
Let's go back to today. It's
November 1986, Monday 24th and
the male:female ratio is now finite.
Women are here in much greater
numbers than ever before and their
role within this college is significant.
The temperament of the average
male is somewhat milder. Social
attitudes have meant that the
masculine image is now less well
defined and the necessity to be big,
and butch is now no longer a
necessity. The CCUs, however,
appear to have failed in registering
'The air is thick with bravado,
and the comardeship is
something special"
was predominantly male to a much
greater extent then it is today and
those gentlemen who studied here
looked to their C C U s f o r
entertainment. Men were men, and
CCUs were CCUs. Activities such as
mascotry, Jez, Rag and drinking did
much to develop a spirit of
camaraderie. Men participated in
events which conjured up an
atmosphere of the army life: "we're
all in this together lads." RCS, C&G
this shift in character. Recent years
have seen the CCUs continue to
cater for the pre-punk brigade, with
the majority of events intended to
please the masculine element. This is
why resentment of the Unions by
some students has grown, and
recruitment of new blood has
become so difficult.
But fear ye not personages of little
faith for the times they are a
changin', the tides they are a turnin',
and the hamsters they a reproducin':
In my opinion RCS and Guilds
have begun to metamorphose. I was
elected on the grounds that things
would change and indeed I believe
that this years first years see the RCS
as being a worthwhile organisation
with activities ranging from Rocky
Horror to Jez and the Brighton
Run, and from Broadsheet to the
clubs and societies. Life's wonderful
and sun's shining and the
hampsters are still rapidly
multiplying....but there is one flaw.
The first years are an unbiased
group viewing the CCUs from
afresh, the rest of college has built
up one or two years of prejudice and
a belief that the CCUs have changed
is rare. Unless the rest of college
gives the CCUs a chance this year
the enthusiasm of the Freshers will
be quenched. Things are developing
and the first year's are providing the
impetus but there will have to be a
time when a college-wide backing is
going to be required.
If you are a keen first year stay
keen and back the CCU events, if
you are despondent second/third
year give us a fair chance.
Just in case you think that the
tradional CCU activities are going
to suffer under this new camp
regime then once again fear ye not.
Jez, mascotry, rag etc. are all being
supported to an extent far greater
than in recent years-in fact its
probably true to say that they are
thriving.
