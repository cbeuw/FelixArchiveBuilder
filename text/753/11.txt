Opinion FELIX, Friday November 7th 1986 15

An opinion article by Roger Wilson
On Saturday 1st November the
Links Club held its 60th
Anniversary Ball in the Main
Dining Hall in the Sherfield
Building.
This was the culmination of 2
years of preparations by the College
members of the club, and was
attended by 210 people. Links Club
members and their guests
representing every decade of the
Club's history came from Hong
Kong, New York, Pakistan and all
parts of Europe to celebrate the
continued strength of the club and
to toast its honourable intentions:
"The promotion of friendship
and good fellowship amongst the
members of the club,both at college
and for years to come."
Following the dinner a toast to
the club was proposed by Stephen
Bishop (C&G President 1982-83).
This was then replied to by Peter
Harding who spoke of his days at
college during the war and his
experiences of having met members
of the club on his travels all over the
world.
A toast to the guests was made by
Roger Wilson, welcoming them on
behalf of the club. This was replied
to by Maria O'Donnell (C&G Hon.
Sec. 1969/70) wife of past C & G
President Chris O'Donnell. Maria's
speech was one of the highlights of
the evening, firstly satirising the
marriage of a man and his pewter
pot and then paying tribute to the
Club for the fellowship that must
exist within it to draw back so many
members of all ages from all parts of
the world.
At this point the formal part of
the evening was over and the
champagne corks popped to mark
the Club's entry into its seventh
decade.
The party then really began as a
steel band got people up and
dancing. At one point a huge conga
wound its way around the Hall,
through the kitchens and through
the ante-room as well.
The music continued with an
hours set from a traditional jazz
band. Younger members were put
to shame by "Bert" Grace, the
oldest member present, and his wife
as they quickstepped around the
dancefloor in a faultless
demonstration.
A further hour from each of the
bands saw only the fittest left on
their feet at the end of a memorable
evening.
Writing this as I do before the
outcome of Tuesdays U G M motion
concerning the three tie clubs I can
only say that I was proud to have
had the honour of Chairing this Ball
and I hope that some of the friends I
met on Saturday night will be still
with me for the Club's next
anniversary.
My final point is that I feel sad
that Imperial College Union should
feel that it wants to ban any club
that can retain links with college
members from over the past ninety
years; all of whom in their day have
given good service to both City and
Guilds and Imperial Colleges.
Hon. Sec. Links Club 1986/7.
