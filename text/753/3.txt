Wilkinson's Sword
view of those who drafted it. I find it
rather depressing, however, that any
student union should support
"institutionalised sexism". I am
sure, as has been said several times
recently, that the three " C C U tie
clubs" command immense loyalty,
and are justly proud of their
histories. When you remember that
it was only fifteen years ago that
women students were allowed in the
Union Bar, it is difficult to regard IC
as anything but way behind the
times. If you have stood in Beit
Quad when 22 Club are pissing out
of the Union Dining Hall windows
during their annual dinner you
would have little doubt of the effect
that these clubs have on IC Union.

Food
Glorious
Food
Southside Refectory will be
converted into a "mini food hall"
during the Easter vacation, at a cost
of £80,000. The new outlet,
described by Refectories Manager
Mr. Rob Northey as 'a new concept
in food halls' will specialise in a
variety of home-made pies, salads
and alternative main courses.
Consumers will be able to use the
Linstead Hall Services whilst the
refectory is being refurbished.
The move follows complaints
from Summer Accomodation
Centre clients that the decoration
was 'grubby', the food quality low,
and the range of choice poor.
Grants
Too Low
Cuts in the value of the student
grant are having worrying effects on
students welfare, according to NUS
President Vickly Phillips in her
address to the House of Commons
Education, Science and Arts Select
Committee last year.
Since 1978 the grant has been
reduced by 20% in real terms and,
say the NUS, spend students now
38% less on food than is necessary to
keep to the DHSS recommended
diet.
The Government's policy on
grants has been strongly criticised
by the Labour Party which plans to
restore grants to the pre 1979 level.
In a recent statement, however
the party announced that it will be
unable to fulfill its promise to
restore the grant immediately but
plan to increase the grant gradually.
Professor Sir Geoffry Wilkinson
head of the chemistry department
and Nobel Laureate has written to
the Government calling for the
closure of many of the country's
chemistry departments. Following
the publication of University results
this summer, Sir Geoffrey argues
that the smaller departments are not
cost effective and produce very few
graduates. He believes that they
cannot afford essential equipment
such as Raman and Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance Spectro-
meters, and that they are unable to
Sixty marchers arrived in Hyde Park
on Sunday at the end of a month
long march from Tyneside. Eight
thousand people turned up to
support the march, which re-
enacted the 1936 march for jobs by
the people of Jarrow.
The organisers said that a lot of
interest had been shown despite
inadequate publicity. Dick Muskett,
one of the march officials
commented "we don't expect the
Government to take much notice,
but then the Government doesn't
take much notice of anything."
The marchers moved to Trafalgar
Square in the afternoon to listen to
speeches by the general secretary of
the TUC and members of the
Labour Party. They handed over a
petition of protest to Neil Kinnock
provide journal libraries. He is also
concerned that full use cannot be
made of equipment in departments
with fewer than one-hundred
research staff.
In an interview in the Times
Higher Education Supplement, Sir
Geoffrey expressed his concern with
the funding given to Universitys for
chemistry "my department which
was the only one in London given a
star rating in the recent University
Grant Committee exercise will have
a deficit of £150,000 this year" he
said.
