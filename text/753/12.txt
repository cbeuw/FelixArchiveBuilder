IC F a l l to S u s s e x
This was the third match in the
U.A^U. competition for I.C., and
Sussex had the reputation of being
one of the better teams in the group.
I.C. kicked off, and immediately
started to take the game to the
o p p o s i t i o n , winning back
possession in the first scrum and
making good ground into Sussex's
22 metre area. The first lineout was
won and the ball whipped out to
flyhalf Mike Anderson by the
scrum-half, Andy Watson; the ball
was passed down the line, and a
neck developed. Sussex won the
ball, and it reached their winger in a
very slick fashion, and he ran half
the length of the pitch to score. I.C.
retorted, with the forwards
dominating and winning the lion's
share of the set possession, and the
game was again played in Sussex's
half. After about 20 minutes of play,
their line again put in some good
running, to score from a maul in the
I.C. 22 metre area. The referee
ordered a rather dubious penalty 5
metres from the I.C. line just before
half-time, and the Sussex scrum half
took it quickly and flipped it out to
the winger, who went over in the
corner. After half time I.C. came
back with a vengeance, with the
forwards working hard and winning
some good balls. Steve Parker was
cleaning everything up at the back
of the lineout, and Andy Martin was
making life hell for the Sussex
hooker in the scrums. Josh Somhon
and Jason Jenkins provided a solid
scrummaging base in the front row.
Unfortunately for the I.C. pack,
Jason Jenkins was sent off with
about 20 minutes to go, and with
only seven men in the pack, I.C.
could not carry on with the same
domination in the scrum. Mike
Anderson pulled back 3 points with
a penalty kick, but full-time went
with I.C. the losers.
Football
Seconds hold
Thirds
On a rain swept Harlington pitch
last Wednesday IC 3rds again
gained an impressive draw against a
lack lustre and somewhat
demoralised IC 2nds. A fairly even
first half saw chances at either end
but the 3rds gradually obtained
control. Heavy tackling and
commitment almost resulted in all
22 players being sent off as tempers
flared. Chris Budgen almost put the
3rds ahead with an acrobatic header
just wide.
The 3rds withstood early 2nd half
pressure and increased the tempo.
Against the run of play Neil
MacDonald thumped a superb
header against the 3rds crossbar.
The 2nds did take the lead with a
clever chip by Phil Adams from the
edge of the area. Not to be denied,
the 3rds piled on the pressure, Paul
Savage and Paul Thompson both
going close. The deserved equaliser
arrived from Hideo Takan, a fine
left foot drive after a smart four man
move. Firing on all cylinders, the
3rds laid siege to the 2nds goal only
to be denied by excellent handling
by 2nds keeper Dave Martin.
The final whistle came as a
disappointment to the 3rds, but a
relief to the 2nds, having clung on to
a valuable point.
Ladies Rugby
Success
Continues
This last week has seen the Ladies'
Rugby Team maintain their one
hundred percent record with two
further victories against Q.M.C. on
the Wednesday 24-4, and Reading
on Sunday 24-6.
Strong forward play in both
games ensured good posession for
the backs. From this, quick passing
down the line meant the two wings
Vanessa Dodge and Sabrina
Demello were often left with space
and time to gain good ground and
often score.
Tries in the two matches were
scored by Vanessa Dodge (1),
Sabrina Demello (2), Judith Day
(1), Judy Gardener (1), Blanca
Roberts (2), Anne Parsons (4), Juliet
Fletcher (1). These victories provide
a base to build on for our
forthcoming league games which
begin next Sunday against
Richmond.
The U L U trials are this
Wednesday. Meet 1.30 outside
University of London Union, all
players should attend.

Sussex
I.C. lst XI continued their
unbeaten run on Wednesday by
scoring a resounding 8-1 victory in
the U A V competition over Sussex
University at Brighton. The game
was played on a very heavy, wet
pitch but even so, I.C. were able to
use their superior skill to control the
game and keep almost continual
pressure on the Sussex defence.
Goals were scored by Paul
Hanrahan, Paul Skipworth,
Brendan Farmer and Justin Smellie.
Saturday's Middlesex League
game against Ashford ended in a 2-2
draw. Harry opened the scoring for
I.C. against a very strong
opposition. Ashford eventually
forced two goals despite Phil
Choudry saving a penalty flick. A
spirited effort by I.C. pressurised the
defence and levelled the score.
Another successful week for the lst
XI.
Hockey; Motspur Park Tournament
Lost on
Penalties
Last Sunday (26/10) marked the
first outing this year for RSM's
mixed team. The first stages of the
competition consisted often minute
games within a league system. RSM
won three games against QEC, SOP
and Chelsea and drew with K C H to
put us top of our league despite
having only 9 players. In the quarter
finals we drew 0-0 with QMCI after
extra time, leading to a series of
penalty flicks which sadly we lost on
sudden death.
In general it was a great team
effort although special mention
must go to Mark Rayfield, who
scored three of our five goals, as well
as the ladies, Kathryn, Barbara and
Sharon without whom our mixed
team would not have existed.

Brighton
On Wednesday IC Hockey 2nd's
thrashed a brilliant Sussex side. The
first outstanding achievement came
when Josh scored with a well placed
penalty flick. Following two
disallowed goals we proceded to
press home our supremacy. The
umpire seemed a nice boy, in
keeping with most of Brighton's
population. The second goal was
rather fortunate, otherwise Gary
Knaresborough would have been a
eunuch by now.
The reorganised defence skillfully
stifled their attack brilliantly
without any difficulty. A clinical
short corner involving Eunuch,
Nanette and Travolta who scored,
made it 3-0. Josh then completed his
hat-trick. The 5th was scored by No-
Name who dribbled it past the
defence and slotted it into the near
post.
