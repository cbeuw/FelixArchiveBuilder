GUC Stupidity
Dear Sir,
I could hardly believe the degree
of stupidity and sheer lack of
intelligence displayed by the U L U
General Union Council as reported
in FELIX last week. Their criticism
of the Government's "Freedom of
Speech" clause leads me to conclude
that they would perhaps quite like to
live under a t o t a l i t a r i a n
dictatorship, in which some Big
Brother decides who is allowed to
air their views and who isn't.
The only way in which the clause
will "affect their (the Unions') rights
to represent the views of a great deal
of their members" will be to
IMPROVE that representation. If
more students are free to air their
views to the Union, then the
representation can only become
more accurate. Of course it will
jeopardise " n o p l a t f o r m "
policies—that is exactly what it is
meant to do. Many student unions
prevent large numbers of their
members (including Conservatives,
Jews and anyone deemed by the
Union to be "sexist") from speaking
at union meetings and writing in
union publications. The sooner this
is stopped the better.
There is no reason why students
should be subjected to the incessant
flow of extreme left-wing
propaganda which most unions
pour out, and from which we at
Imperial are, thankfully, relatively
insulated. I have no objection to left-
wing propaganda as long as there is
an equal volume of right-wing
propaganda, and students are left to
make up their own minds. This is
what the "Freedom of Speech"
clause in the Education Bill is for.
Yours sincerely,

Public Order
Bill
Dear Sir,
Your report of the recent U L U
GUC meeting (Felix 752) left me
concerned about the thinking within
the council. You report that the
Public Order Bill was criticised as
being a breach of democratic
freedom. Leaving aside the accuracy
or otherwise of this belief, the
GUC'S support for democracy is
encouraging; in the next paragraph,
however, we are told that the
'freedom of speech' claim in the
Education Bill was also criticised, as
the council "felt that this would
jeopardise Student Unions' 'no
platform' policies." Yet surely these
policies are a breach of the
democratic freedom the GUC is so
keen to uphold? Obviously the
GUC is in favour of democratic
freedom only as long as it is in its
own interest— a strange kind of
democracy!
This hypocritical attitude is also
rife within the NUS, which some
members of College think we should
rejoin. Hopefully the vast majority
of IC students are sensible enough
to realise that we have no need to be
part of this undemocratic
organisation or its discriminate
policies.
Yours faithfully,

Senseless
Policy
Dear Sir,
It seems as though U L U has done
it again: agreed on a senseless policy
against the best interests of students
for totally illogical reasons. I speak
of the decision, made at the G U C
meeting reported in FELIX last
week, to oppose the introduction of
student loans on the grounds that
they would jeopardise students from
low income brackets.
The whole point of loans is to put
everyone on an equal footing. Those
from low income backgrounds who
have already shown the
determination and ability to
continue their education in their
desire for a better career would be in
the same position as those whose
LEA has, under the present system
decreed that their parents can afford
£300, £500, or £700 a term, but do
not actually receive the full parental
contribution.
At the moment these students end
up even poorer than a student on a
"Full Grant", (the value of which
has fallen to an intolerably low level,
thanks to the inability of the NUS to
represent students' interests
effectively.)
One understandable reservation
people have about loans is the threat
of "a black cloud of debt." This,
too, is unfounded. The proposals
are for a government supported
loan to be paid off at very low
interest rates as the graduate's
career develops. Why should this
black cloud hang over the heads of
the predominantly low income,
working class tax-payers ,while the
typical middle-class student
indulges itself (I'm not sexist) in
copious quantities of beer?
If you are not convinced by the
direct benefits of grants, consider
the more frequent criticisms of
Universities. Far too many students
from an all-too-easy middle-class
background fall into a university
education purely as a continuation
of school. Given a degree of
financial responsibility, they might
think a little harder about what is
right for them, and how best to
achieve it, avoiding a potential
college drop-out in the process. We
all know that degree courses often
have little relevance to the real
world. A loan system would
increase the pressure on Universities
to develop the right courses for
industry and commerce, and to
create a market for their invaluable
arts and classics qualifications.

Outdated and
sexist
Dear Editor,
I read with interest the article in
last week's FELIX regarding Jane
Spiegel's proposal for a U G M
emergency motion. The motion
urges the banning of CCU drinking
clubs from using college facilities on
the grounds that they are "outdated
and sexist".
My attention was then drawn to
another article regarding Women in
Science and Techn.' i«rv 'WIST), a
society, and I quote the article, "run
by women for women students". Is
Ms. Spiegel a member of this society
or does she consider that it too
should be banned for being sexist?
I have no personal interest in
either the C C U drinking clubs or
WIST, but I do feel that this motion
is yet another example of the
hypocrisy that we have come to
expect from feminists.
As a final thought, might it not be
reasonable to suggest that Women
in Science and Technology (WIST)
change its name to Persons in
Science and Technology!!
Yours sincerely,
Jonathan Turner

Correction
The date of the 150th
anniversary celebration
referred to in Mrs. Ash's
article (FELIX 752, page
4) should have read July
10th and not July 12th.

Editorial
Having waited so long for the
motion on Barclays Bank to get a
hearing, it was something of a
disappointment for the motion to be
defeated. It is encouraging,
however, to have a U G M where
banal humour gives way to serious
debate. Though the voting figures
show the attendence at that stage to
be slightly below the quorum of 300,
all interested parties seemed keen to
take advantage of an acceptably
representative forum.
The Barclays issue will, I suspect,
reappear sometime in the future in
amended form. I am not in a
position to dispute any of the
information presented by John
Martin, or for that matter Shaun
Dunlop, but I still contest much of
John's argument. He went to
significant lengths on Tuesday to
stress Barclay's concern for the non-
whites in South Africa, including
the donation of a significant
percentage of their profits to
oppressed groups. Praiseworthy
action, I agree, but it is misleading to
think that Barclays has any concern
for the people of South Africa. Like
any of the banks, or any large
business concern, their primary goal
is profit, and South Africa with its
massive mineral wealth is a
profitable country for bankers.
Barclays may have been 'generous'
to blacks, and may have broken
South African laws to employ them
but this is window-dressing; to
pretend that it is anything else is
naive in the extreme. The issue is
straightforward; Barclays is a
significant financial organisation in
a country with a racist government,
and as such is a supporter of the
regime. The other high street banks,
I know, also have interests in South
Africa, and the reason is the same:
financial gain. Their involvement
does nothing to absolve Barclays,
which is simply the bank with the
heaviest commitment, and as such
deserves the attention of
organisations keen to see the
destruction of the apartheid system.
John also said at the U G M that
Barclays (in Britain) was not directly
connected with Barclays National
(in South Africa). This argument
implies that he does not condone
Barclays involvement.
I appreciate the philosophy that
apartheid can be changed from
within, but Barclays Bank are not
interested in leading the way, only in
the protection of their financial
interests.
