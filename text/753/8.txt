Morphy Day, words which make
the I C U Exec cringe with
denouncement and make their toes,
curl up. Strange diseases might be
said to be caught here, and the Exec
last year obviously fell foul to it so
badly that they banned the event —
but why should the memorial to the
Morphy in Morphy Richards cause
such a rumpus? It's quite simple if
you think of it — residents of Putney
do too! The main event revolves
round the inter CCU battle for the
Morphy Oar — "battle" is not too
strong a word for what ensues for
this worthless piece of wood. After
the boat races on the Thames, the
battle starts on land, using weapons
such as buckets of rotting fish, and
'An opportunity to dress up
in Mummy's clothes'
refuse which everyone has happened
to have brought along for the day.
The winner is the C C U which
manages to drive off with the oar.
People then adjourn, gracefully clad
in their non-too-nice-smelling
clothes, to Harrods for tea. After
being thrown out of there, the
remaining participants clean
themselves up, take a tetanus, and
meet in the Southside Bar ready to
go to a pub and attempt to drink it
dry — or slightly damp anyway.
Locations of the victimised pub are
kept secret, not even I know where it
is! Like good boys and girls,
everyone attends lectures the next
day on Thursday, and if you like
jumping up and taking your
trousers down at the mention of the
words "gobbledygook", then you're
an obvious victim for Martin S.
Taylor's hypnosis demonstration on
Thursday evening at 7.30 pm. Pink
Elephants and Marshmellow men
appear before your very eyes —
though not altogether Samantha
Fox or Edwina Curry, they prove to
be most amusing.
Friday heralds a rather large
party in the Union Building. Based
on a similar format to Ents Carnival
comes Rag Guilds Carnival: bigger,
better, busting with brilliant
entertainment. Bands? We've got
Drum Theatre, Pink Peg Slax,
Brother Brother a. ' support.
Comedians? No problem! Kevin
Day, and Belinda Blanchard will
make you laugh yourself silly. A
night to remember, but only those
who aren't completely plastered will
remember. Who knows? You might
even know someone there.
Like good boys and girls you
don't go to lectures on Saturday.
The first weekend approaches, and
Rag Week takes a quiet breather.
On Saturday, we will be holding a
Science Fiction video marathon for
those bods with a fetish for Dr.
Who, Jo-90, Space 1999, Men from
Uncle and more besides. People are
quite welcome to watch, but some
people will be attempting to stay
awake the full 48 hours. A quiet
evening of cocktails in Southside
Bar rounds off a quiet Saturday with
a large range to tickle anyone's
fancy.
On Sunday, you may have
thought that you would be allowed
to get some sleep for a change — but
it is not to be. For at the very
unsociable time of 10.00 am, the
CCUs are holding a Tug 'o' War in
Princes Gardens — not content with
that, they suddenly rush off to the
Serpentine to climb into strange
artefacts constructed with lumps of
polystyrene, bog rolls and sticky-
back plastic (specified in the Blue
Peter Manuals 703) and promptly
try to row across the stretch of
water, avoiding the ducks and
fighting to stay afloat. Called the
Inter C C U Raft Race, the rafts make
amazing submarines after a while.
In the evening is Rag Barnite with
Chaps providing food in the form of
their suberb curries — the ones
which are quite hard to get rid of —
at the Mines Ragarama. And so, the
weekend finally ends, ready for Rag
Week Stage 2 and like good little
boys and girls, we all attend lectures
the next day.
At lunchtime of the new week, the
Aerosoc Darts Tournament is held
— taking place at the top of the
Union Building: you can fire your
prototype origami warheads into
Beit Quad. This is followed in the
evening by the Mines Dirty Disco —
three guesses what happens here.
Time to dust off your dirty macs and
suspender belts and to meet the
mature school girls.
How much for your wife? How
much for the services of your body
for the day? Then come to the Slave
A u c t i o n held on Tuesday
lunchtime, when real flesh and bone
Will be auctioned for the day for
every whim and fancy.
Getting into full swing now, the
RCS Beer Festival hits Rag Week on
Wednesday at 12.00pm where a
selection of beers will be available
throughout the day (and night).
Amazing things happen at Beer
Festivals, and they often do!
Like good boys and girls, we try
to make the next day's lectures, and
although unwelcome as it may seem,
Thursday arrives and queues for
coffee and asprins at Waitrose
suddenly form to stock up for Rag
Week Stage 3. The RCS Smoking
Concert rears its head on Thursday
evening, best described as a cross
between the Wheeltappers' and
Shunters' Club and Live Aid. The
patience and dedication of the
performance is nothing compared
to that of the patience and
dedication of the audience — places
are amusing, places are awful and
places just are. (Ear plugs not
provided).
Like good boys and girls, you
attempt for the last time to make the
next day's lecture. Into the final
stretch now, and the Rag and Drag
Disco appears on the scene on
Friday night. No prizes for what
you're wearing. An event which
makes people realise their true inner
fantasies and tendencies, it's a
legitimate excuse for getting into
"mummy's" clothes. On the same
night in Southside commences
1000001 Darts, where people throw
darts at a board to get down to 0 in
the least throws before the end of
Sunday.
Rag Week 1986 now ends off on
Saturday, with SCAB Nite. Not
related to the Bubonic Plague,
SCAB Nite is where various
societies of the Social, Cultural and
Amusements Board show off their
wares. Although a little more
advanced in the professional ladder
than the Smoking Concert, the night
will prove to be just as entertaining.
And thus endeth Rag Week 1986,
but not Rag 1986! More events will
be organised for next term. Till then
Rag will slowly gather its
momentum again, and the Rag
organisers will try to catch up on
lectures, sleep and food. I really
hope you will enjoy Rag Week and
that the detailed descriptions have
not put you off. Spare a thought for
the cause and effect the means are
irrelevant!
