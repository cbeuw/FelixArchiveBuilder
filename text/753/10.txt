The Mission
There is usually one movie each year
which attracts the sort of people
who rarely go to the cinema but
think that they 'ought' to see it so
that they can bore their friends by
talking about it at dinner parties.
"The Mission" is it!
Director Roland Jaffe has
attempted to make an epic film on
the scale of 'El Cid' and 'Ben Hur'.
Visually the film is a masterpiece,
every frame would make a
spectacular still photograph but
unfortunately the Amazon was
filmed almost as well a few years ago
in "The Emerald Forest" and so
looks all too familiar. The script was
written by Robert Bolt whose
previous works include " D r .
Zhivago" and " A Man for All
Seasons", however most of the two
hours were dialogueless and lots of
pained expressions from Jeremy
Irons and heavy music could not
make up for this gaping hole. What
lines there were were frequently over
blown and self-conscious,
completely wasting all of Robert de
Niro's phenomenal talent and
removing most of the story's
credibility.
Characterisation is sacrificed for
spectacle, by the end I had no
interest or sympathy in the
protaganists, even the sight of de
Niro getting blasted left me totally
unmoved! I fail completely to see
how anybody could find the film
powerful, it is male-orientated with
virtually no female characters which
is perhaps why I was left cold by the
end.
If the hype is to be believed, the
future of the (yawn, yawn....) British
Film Industry and Goldcrest
depends on the "The Mission"
f o l l o w i n g the f a i l u r e of
"Revolution" and "Absolute
Beginners". Any company that
finances three films, all with the
same faults, deserves to go bust.
However,I may be over-critical and
so you ought to go and make up
your own mind.

The Mission II
"The Mission" is a film made by
people with very impressive
pedigrees, the director Roland
Joffe's previous film was "The
Killing Fields", screenwriter
Richard Bolt was responsible for "A
Man for All Seasons" and the music
is by Ennio Morricane, then there is
the impressive cast consisting of
Robert de Niro and Jeremy Irons
amongst others. Unfortunately
however the whole is less than the
sum of the parts.
The mission in question is a Jesuit
outpost in 18th century South
America which becomes the object
of a political struggle between the
Spanish and Portuguese govern-
ments. A Pope's envoy (Ray
McAnally) is sent to assess the
situation and determine the best
course of action. In charge of the
mission is a dedicated pacifist,
Jeremy Irons, wL ;
" '.etermined
that the surrounding area, including
the mission, should not fall into the
hands of the Portuguese who still
practice slavery. Should the mission
resist at all, the whole future of the
Jesuit movement throughout
Europe would be jeopardised, thus
the scene is set for the sort of rural
dilemma that both Joffe and Bolt
revel in.
The acting is of the highest
standard, Robert de Niro, in spite of
being rather out of place in a
historical film, being a very modern
actor, is nevertheless one of the
finest actors alive, and Jeremy Irons
is magnificent as the gentle, caring
priest. But above both of these is the
scene stealing Ray McAnally who
plays the Pope's envoy charged with
the difficult task of conveying a
decision against his own wishes as a
result of distant European politics.
He is brilliant at expressing both the
awe he feels on sighting the
unexpected splendour of the
"savages" and the regret in his task.
Roland Joffe's direction is
unobtrusive and, in spite of a few
laboured symbolisms, virtually
faultless unlike Chris Menges
photography which is faultless.
Joffe's self confessed aim, and an
entirely defensible one at that, is to
place entertainment above historical
fact, the events of the period merely
provide a basis for a good story. One
major flaw with this film is that the
Indians themselves are not given
sufficient individual characteristics
in order that the audience can
identify more readily with their
plight such that the denouement is
as emotive as it should be in spite of
some photojournalist composition
by Menges. The film however is well
worth seeing and has the added
purpose of drawing attention to the
plight of these people who up to ten
years ago were still being traded as
slaves.
WOMAG (The Women's media
Action Group) is organizing a
survey of the media this weekend in
order to determine the scale of
current advertising that could be
considered sexist or offensive to
women.
WOMAG wants women in
London to scour publications,
television, radio and cinema
advertising for potentially
degrading material and to get in
touch with them, they in turn will
pass complaints on to the
Advertising Standards Authority.
If you wish to participate cut out
the ad and record the publication,
date and page number, or, if it was
on television record, the channel
and time of broadcast. Also please
describe briefly why you consider it
offensive. WOMAG can be
contacted directly at 48 William IV
St., London. WC2. (Tel:01-836-
6081) or via Liz Holford in the
'Felix' office.
Almost every women has
complained of sexist advertising at
some time or another, now is your
chance to do something about it!
