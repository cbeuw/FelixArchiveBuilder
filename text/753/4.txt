FELIX:Bashing
Careers Fair
Dear Sir,
It would appear that silly season
is once again upon us, with some of
the comment in last week's 'Let's
bash the Careers Fair' Felix
progressing from the sublime to the
ridiculous.
Page 1. "Also criticised (at U L U
GUC) was the Governments' plan
to include a Freedom of Speech
clause in the Education Bill. The
Council felt that this would
jeopardise Student Unions' 'no
platform' policies and would affect
their rights to represent the views of
a great deal of their members."
FELIX 752 included a Human
Rights supplement. Don't let's beat
about the bush: NO-PLATFORM
POLICIES A R E DESIGNED TO
G A G P E O P L E — O F T E N
M I N O R I T Y G R O U P S O R
INDIVIDUALS. Sometimes this
occurs on the grounds of race—
such as Jews at Sunderland Poly;
politics— such as Conservatives at
P C L ; sexuality— such as
heterosexuals at NUS conferences.
Rent Structure
Apology
Last year, the Students Residence
Committee decided to adjust the
College's residence rent structure.
This meant that some rents went
down, but the best and most
popular residences' rents went up by
nearly 20%. The most popular of all,
Weeks Hall, rose to £32.10 per week
from £27.30.
The rents quoted on residence
application information did not
reflect this large rise since it was
printed in Summer 1985.
The SRC has agreed to apologise
officially to the residents of Weeks
Hall for any misapprehensions they
may have been under when they
applied about the cost of a place in
that hall. As you can see, the
situation arose due to circumstances
beyond our control and we are sorry
that you were the inevitable victims
of those circumstances.
May you be consoled by the fart
that you are living in the best-
equipped hall in IC.
I would like to take this
opportunity to say thank you to
Peter Hallworth for the excellent
improvements he has made in
Southside and Evelyn Gardens,
even if they are a little behind
schedule.
I have looked these facilities over
and am genuinely impressed; may
the good work continue rapidly.

Freedom of Speech is dirty talk at
NUS, U L U etc. and every time they
open their mouths, they confirm
this. They claim they have the right
to represent you. It is a Human
Right to be able to represent
yourself.
Page 2: " A 'small group of
students' organised a leaflet appeal
asking students to consider the
implications of a career with
military connections. At one stage
they were asked to leave the
fair The publicity may not have
carried the name of any ICU
Society, but I (Editor) for one would
like to be associated with its
sentiments".
Amongst other organisations,
REME were at the Careers Fair
providing a service to students who
may wish to pursue that career.
They may, in future, abstain from
the opportunity of attending: it was
grossly arrogant to use the Careers
Fair for political purposes. The
cowardly pathos shown by
distributing anonymous literature
contrasts strongly with the heroic
people who are willing to lay dowi*
their lives in defence of freedom.
This week we honour those people
who died that children whose
organs had been removed and
replaced elsewhere in the body
could be relieved from Auschwitz.
And those who died to relieve those
women at Ravensbruck who had
been injected with petrol to induce
osteomyelitis. We honour the dead
by making a contribution to the
injured and not by deriding their
successors.
Page 6: " as President of a Union
like this I am often called upon to
make a decision or state an opinion
on an issue of a "wider"
importance." May I suggest three
alternatives to letting political
extremists in UGMs decide, when
they are usually a tiny minority of
student opinion:
i)Describe several points of view, for
example "some oppose Barclays in
South Africa; the majority think
that Barclays are doing a good job.
It is split 40:60"
ii)Referendum on the issue when it is
of major importance.
iii)Go out on the walkway/RSM
foyer/Huxley entrance at 9.15 and
ask Jo student what he/she thinks.
Page 6: " 'Imperial would still
appear to be hearing a pile of shit as
far as Lesbian and Gay liberation
goes...' To a large a
xtent I would
agree with him. Impei.... nas no gay
society and anyone hoping to form
one might expect considerable
resistance, even harassment." And
from where, the foul mouthed Mr.
Beeston, does this pile emanate? Is it
that renowned ex-IC student, the
Pope? There is nothing in FELIX in
over two years which even suggests
* anti-homosexual sentiment. Has
anyone been harassed? Is there a
heterosexual society? Why push
'sexual liberation' down our
throats? Many of us like to develop
our sexuality privately and at our
own time. Those who don't
maintain the right to do as they wish
providing you don't gag them with
another one of your Stalinist 'no
platform' policies. But most of all,
what gave you the idea, Mr.
Beeston, that you were sent, like a
Messiah, to lead others?
Finally, by the time you read this
you should have had access to a
Barclays leaflet giving you some
firm comment on Barclays'
involvement in South Africa. It is in
response to the insert you may have
seen in the ICU handbook which
was discourteously and hypo-
critically placed opposite a Barclays
advert. Like the insert in your
handbook this is not funded by ICU
and it has not been subject to ICU
editorial control. The distributors
were, due in some cases to their
working class status, unable to print
their own literature (as I am
informed the distributors of the first
leaflet were). Please use it to make a
considered decision about your
involvement with the bank. It has
been distributed by S. Jarvis, P.
Chapman, J. Ransom and myself,
Yours faithfully,

Security
Ignored
Dear Editor,
I would like to reply to the letter
about security in Hamlet from last
week.
Perhaps I could take this
opportunity to explain the appalling
state of the security across Imperial
College. At present there are people
wandering around College with
master keys that can open almost
any door in College Halls. No one
knows how many of these are
missing; only the people who have
lost valuable items from their room
can estimate. At present it appears
that these keys are only being used
to steal things; this is done in an
ordered way where the people know
what to take. No one seems to have
realised that these keys could also be
used for rape and that no one is safe
in their own rooms at night. Last
year the College was warned (by an
article in FELIX), that security in
halls was appalling, in which it was
stated "will it take another rape or
worse, before action is taken?"
(Thanks for that warning, B.
Morrison and A. Barister). It would
appear this was all but completely
ignored, and now the Rector has the
nerve to say "It is easy to be wise
after the event".
The key system in Halls should
have been replaced years ago.
College know that but have put no
money aside to deal with it and have
no plans to do so. At the last IC
council it was decided to force the
Student Residence Committee to do
something about this fact.
Unfortunately by the time this was
raised at SRC the rape at Hamlet
had already occurred. SRC has
agreed to set up a working party to
look into security (I am on it and
any information is appreciated) but
so far nearly two weeks have passed
and I have not even had notification
of a meeting.
I completely agree with the fact
that nothing has been done, but the
only way we can force College to do
something is to have hard facts. So
please send Christine or me any
opinions you have or information
on break-ins etc. We need your help
to help you.

Civilisation
Explained
Dear Dave,
Perhaps you can help me as I am
having trouble finding a satisfactory
explanation of "civilisation". Last
Wednesday I was honoured with an
invitation to the RCS Chemistry
department dinner. The following
evening I drove a van for the
I C C A G Soup Run. I must say that,
by all the definitions of the word
that I have found so far, the second
occasion was more civilised. I am
puzzled why some people attach so
much formality to an excuse for
getting mindlessly ill and posing
around in front of a few first years.
It puzzled me too why people should
pay so much for the privilege of
doing all this while consuming fairly
average college food which would
be better distributed to the, frankly
more civilised, down-and-out
population of London.
Am I just posing around and
trying to start an argument or what?
