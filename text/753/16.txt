News FELIX, Friday November 7th 1986 20
N o P r o g r e s s M a d e
The Managing Surveyor of
Residences, Mr. Peter Hallworth,
has written to the Tizard Hall
Residence Committee to explain
why no progress has been made in
the proposed improvements to the
Tizard and Selkirk kitchens. In the
letter, Mr. Hallworth said that his
attempts to get things moving were
"constantly frustrated" by the
Tizard and Selkirk Hall Warden,
Dr. Henry Hutchinson. The Tizard
Hall Committee has described the
letter as "childish and unprofess-
ional".
Mr. Hallworth explained that the
Warden had not supplied him with
the final drafts of the Hall
Committee's suggested kitchen
layouts. When he did receive the
layouts in February he was unable
to act because the plans contained
no provision for the relocation of
stair-case fridges, as required by fire
regulations. A proposal from Mr.
Hutchinson to buy individual
fridges at a cost of £50 for each room
was rejected by Mr. Hallworth
because of the high cost.
Since then Mr. Hallworth has
been waiting for Mr. Hutchinson to
submit an alternative solution to the
fridge problem.
Southside house-keeper, Kate
McPherson told FELIX that she
delivered a copy of Selkirk's kitchen
layouts, identical to those for
Tizard, to Mr. Hallworth in
November, the previous year.
Mr. Hutchinson said that he was
surprised that the problem had not
been referred back to the Students
Residence Committee, when the
individual fridges were rejected.
"The Warden is responsible for
the social life and welfare of
residents. I would have expected the
decision over the fridges to be made
by the SRC", he said. The Tizard
Hall Committee will be holding
further discussions with Mr.
Hallworth next week.
Editors
Ratified Barclays Ban Beaten
Next year's Handbook Editor
and Alternative Prospectus (AP)
Editor were ratified at Tuesday's
U G M . The Handbook Editor,
Pippa Salmon who was proposed
for the post by Jane Spiegel told
FELIX that she was looking
forward to starting work on the
publication. Ms Sunny Bains, the
AP Editor, proposed by Andy
Vickers was unavailable for
comment.
Six months after first being tabled at
a Union General Meeting, Shaun
Dunlop's motion on Barclay's Bank
finally received a hearing on
Tuesday. The motion has appeared
on the agenda of a succession of
UGMs since last Easter, but at each
one quorum was called before a vote
was taken. Quorum remained
unchallenged throughout Tuesday's
meeting because of widespread
interest in the "tie club" motion. On
a show of hands an amended
version of the motion, proposing
that I C U introduce publicity
sanctions against Barclays, was
defeated by 121 votes to 108.
The original motion called for a
ban on Barclays' adverts in all ICU
publications, and requested that IC
students do not open accounts with
Barclays. Proposing this, Mr.
Dunlop quoted a series of examples
of Barclays' involvement in South
African banking. He said that he did
not think it was possible for an
institution to run a business in a
country, and at the same time fight
for significant change in the
government of that country.
Speaking against the motion,
John Martin vehemently refuted
Mr. Dunlop's arguments and said
that Barclays was working hard to
reform South Africa. He said that
Barclays provided financial support
for blacks, and stressed that there
was little connection between
Barclays, as in Britain, and Barclays
National, as in South Africa.
After the initial speeches, Sunny
Bains proposed an amendment to
the motion, altering " I C U
instructs" to "ICU requests" editors
of Union publications not to take
Barclays advertising. This
amendment was upheld on a hand
vote of 123 to 88, and Mr. Dunlop
handed the motion over to Miss
Bains. Following summing up
speeches, the motion was defeated
by 13 votes.
Most of the students present ieft
the meeting after the vote and
q u o r u m was successfully
challenged. The meeting continued
as an informal discussion group and
provisional ratification for the posts
of Handbook Editor, Alternative
Prospectus Editor and Welfare
Officer took place, with Pippa
Salmon, Sunny Bains and Tom
Melliar-Smith being the only
candidates for each post. David
Lowrie, the only candidate for the
post of Academic Affairs Officer
was provisionally ratified, pending
confirmation by the next meeting.
Lawson Cooks
The Chancellor, Nigel Lawson,
announced a £10 billion spending
increase yesterday. Education will
receive an extra £2.25 billion, which
is nineteen percent more than was
originally planned. Mr Kenneth
Baker, the Education Secretary,
welcomed this "huge sum of extra
money" and described it as very
good news for universities,
polytechnics and schools. However,
the Government admitted that the
increase would only be worth an
extra one percent of this years
expenditure when last years
overspending and teachers' pay rises
are taken into consideration.
Musical Chairs
The C.V.C.P. (Committee of Vice
Chancellors & Principals) will
change its Chairman in July. Mr.
Maurice Shock the present
Chairman will pass the post to the
Vice Chancellor of Manchester
University, Professor Sir Mark
Richmon FRS. Sir Mark has been
an active member of the Committee
since becoming a Vice Chancellor
five years ago. He has chaired a
number of C.V.C.P. committees
and has also served on public bodies
including the Government Genetic
Engineering Advisory Group.
Gold Brick
The College House Committee is
considering scrapping the 'Gold
Brick' fund which is presently
available for the purchase of new
student accommodation. If the
move goes ahead the College will be
unable to raise deposits to secure
buildings suitable for new residences
when they come on to the market.
The committee has calculated
that College could save up to
£40,000 a year if the £320,000 fund
were used to repay the loans taken
out to buy Evelyn Gardens and
Montpelier Hall.
College Deputy Secretary, Mr
Brian Lloyd-Davies, said that he
would not like to see the 'Gold
Brick' go and pointed out that there
was already a shortage of
accommodation at Imperial.
Sex Romp
Shock
Students at Balliol College Oxford,
have passed a motion banning
"frolicking and other forms of
pseudo affectionate activity from
the College precincts." The motion
also requests that anyone who
wishes to indulge in "public
affection" gives several days written
notice to the SCR committee.
I.C. Union has no policy on
public affection, however sex is to be
avoided in Union Buildings unless it
is "discrete and unavoidable".
