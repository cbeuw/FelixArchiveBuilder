TT Soc Again
Those of you who read this column
last year may remember some of the
mad goings on in IC's least known
club, TeeTotal Soc. I recently
managed to get hold of a copy ofthe
club rules, which have quite an
interesting history. The first
secretary of the club had been left
alone to write the rules and
unfortunately, without the moral
support of his fellow members and
in a rare moment of weakness, he
went out and bought a bottle (or
two) and proceeded to indulge in
some brain numbing. The upshot of
all this was that a completely
nonsensical set of rules was made
up, as follows:
1. All incorrect rules mean the
opposite of what they say.
2. There are an even number of
correct rules.
3. A l l self-referential rules are
correct.
4. Rule 6 is incorrect.
5. There are two incorrect rules.
6. In all other rules, the words
"incorrect" and "correct" should be
interchanged.
There were seven rules altogether,
but my copy of them had been torn
and all I could tell was that rule 7
refered to 'correct rules...'.

A self referential rule is one that
refers to a set of rules including
itself, for example rule 2 refers to
'correct rules' and thus is self
referential if it is correct. The
amazing thing about these rules is
that, although some of them are
incorrect, they are logically self-
consistent.
This week's problem is to
determine which rules are correct,
and which are incorrect. Answers to
the F E L I X office by 1.00pm
Wednesday for the £5 prize please.
Last Week
It's rare that I am suprised by the
answer to one of my own puzzles,
but this week I was. The answer I
had in mind, and the one that most
people had on their entries was the
following symmetrical path, with 14
turns:
/
m
Y
V
/ A
/ m
/
This is the minimum number of
bends if the path is not to cross itself,
but this was not one of the
conditions of the problem, and it
turns out that it is possible in 13, as
follows:
/
/
/
/ /
/
V
V /
/
I have no idea if this is the unique
solution - it may be possible in even
less! Two people had the correct
answer, M. Robin of Chem Eng IV,
and Chris Pitts of Maths III, and the
randomly selected winner was
Chris. Well done, you can collect
your prize after 1.00pm Monday.

Phone-in shows have always caused
headaches for radio producers since
their inception by Maurice Brown,
alarmed at the rocketing costs of
radio actors in 1959. Brilliant
though the cost-cutting idea was,
the unreliability of the public has
always been a problem with the
shows. However this has now been
cured with a totally computerised
phone-in system. A minicomputer
linked to a speech synthesizer can
generate upto 6 million totally
different calls on any given subject
simply by linkinf c ' -sentences
together. Radio Serpentine are so
pleased with their new unit that they
are looking into an agony show
package. Another variant is the
swearing generator with a built in
four second delay device, so that the
computer can produce realistic bad
language and then edit it out of the
program.
The Trellix Theatre in Covent
Garden have hatched a new concept
in Christmas entertainment. Bored
with the old pantomimes like
Cinderella and Mother Goose, they
have gone for adapting modern
classics. The first to receive this
treatment is George Orwell's 1984
after the success of the film. Music
and songs have been specially
written for the cast of 20, which
include new ones like: "Ain't no fun
in room 101" and "Newspeak
makes the world go round".
Angela Barrie of the theatre
company thinks the story is perfect:
"When Smith takes Julia to his
room in the city, there's plenty of
opportunity to say 'behind you,
behind you' as weli as booing the
Ministry of Love. I think it's a great
family night out — social comment
for Christmas."
