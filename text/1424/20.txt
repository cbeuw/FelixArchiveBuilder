Virgo
This week you watch
the pigeons attack
your food while
you’re trying to eat
it in the quad. Your
so called friends
decide to pour their left-over baked beans over
you, This causes the pigeons to peck at you
until you are horribly disfigured. You spend the
rest of your life in a circus, known only as the
shocking pigeon man.
Scorpio
This week the taste of
blood makes you feel
terribly ill. But that’s
not the reason you’re
ill. The reason is your
flatmates making you
drink vodka until you throw up blood passed out
on the floor. That and the fact they were kicking
you in the ribs all night long, forcing you to drink
more. After a trip to hospital you find out you
need a liver transplant. Shame!
Libra
You are running low
on money this week
and cannot afford
gum to chew. But
you have to see your
personal tutor and
you are hanging out of your arse. Looking in
your wallet you find a mint flavoured condom.
Excellent. You whip it out of its packing and
chew it heartily. Nice. On the one hand you
have fresh breath, but you just ate a condom.
Capricorn
Last week’s Wordoku
answer of snowyfuck
got you thinking.
What is that like? So
when you heard on the
news that it was snow-
ing in the West country you shot down there
quicker than a dog with a firework up its arse.
Once arrived you build a shelter, strip naked
and go at it like two rabbits that are in love and
haven’t been together for a whole month. Pint?
Sagittarius
ACC bar night
proved to be, umm
errr eventful?!? It
filtered down that you
chundered so hard you
burst a blood-vessel
in your left eye. As a result you had to attend
lectures wearing large sunglasses. Your lecturer
called you a cunt and tells you to get the fuck out
of his sight. The class calls you Bono and an Irish
prick. Go cry into your whiskey.
Cancer
Work piles up this
week. You spend so
much time sitting
in your computer
room that if you are
black you will turn
white and vice-versa. Only a strong helping
of, “oh wait, I don’t care” and a trip to the pub
will help you. Watch out. I have warned you.
Ignore me at your peril. Before you know it
you will be shagging little boys too.
Gemini
That cheese grater
that sits all alone
in the bottom
cupboard will make
an unwelcome
appearance at your
22nd birthday this week. Your mates convince
you that it will be an excellent idea for you to
use the spiky side to grate your penis on. The
bottle of Vodka in you tells you that it doesn’t
hurt. Come morning it does. Very much.
Leo
You try the be cool
by ordering a ‘Meg-
aMix’ at your local
kebab house at 3 in
the morning. Whilst
happily munching it
down you choke on a bone. It gets stuck and
you flap for an Ambulance. Once removed it is
taken for analysis and it turns out to be a penis
bone. What do you mean penises don’t have
bones? Fuck you! Mine does...
Taurus
So your girlfriend
has a bad tummy
and has to go to
hospital to get it
checked. Whilst
there they do a
blood test with surprising result. The doctor,
comes up to you... “there appears to be a large
quantity of Rohypnol in your bloodstream.
Almost fatal levels.” Oh shit. You’ve been found
out and are now going to jail to be gay raped.
Aries
This week you are
being businessed
heavily from behind
by your boyfriend-
come-husband.
After a short while
he ups the motion of his ocean and soon he
becomes just a blur. Then with an almighty
boom he goes ultrasonic. You peer over your
shoulder and tenderly ask “Sulright?”. No, his
penis is an exploded bleeding mess.
Pisces
Fire, rape and
pillage. Three of
the things that your
new girlfriend will
be interested in. But
you weigh up your
options... free sex with a proper mental girl,
or a fat wank? The option of a real life girl just
edges ahead. I suggest you keep your bum hole
plugged with a cork from a wine bottle. You
can never be too careful.
Aquarius
New and improved?
Seriously what the
fuck? How can
something be both
new and improved?
If it’s new it is based
upon unused technology. So if it is improved
then it is simply an update. If I said I had a new
method of having sex– i.e. using a condom –
would you be impressed? Surely that’s just an
improvement. I ramble. Fuck you all.
Doing this after ACC Bar
Night so I couldn’t care all that
much. Basically I am hiding
down in felix as people want
to kill me. It’s not my fault
guys! Beer would have been
on much longer but certain
clubs decided to have a fight.
Anyhoo back to the matter
at hand... awww fuck it. I just
want to have a pint and sleep.
Someone won. Well done.
I
t has been a long time since we
had a good long catch up. Seri-
ously, it has been a while. Do you
remember those times when you
sat in your sofa next to a blaz-
ing natural fire, curled up with a large
mug of hot chocolate in one hand, and
felix in the other? Yeah those were
good times. We would have a nice little
monologue, me and you... well just you
(this is all pre-written). I would tell you
all about things that happened in the
last week, what was coming up next
week, and pick out the best bits from
this week’s issue. Good times. Those
were happy days. Remember Sikh MC?
No, well that will be because he never
turned up (to my disappointment). Ah
well, better to carry on not crying. So
taking back the usual tradition I will
start off by saying the FUCWIT league
is still, as ever, dominated by the usual
2 teams, but the struggle for 3rd place
is becoming more and more fierce.
Also notice that the league has been
divided into 2 sections. One for teams,
and one for individuals. We thought it
would be fairer to all the contestants
involved. Chaz really enjoys making
the puzzles each week, and it makes
him happy so many people participate.
So he made another one. It is called

Coffee Break Editor
mentalist maze, and the quickest sub-
mission will get 5 points.
In this issue of felix there is a nice
feature on the college’s previous rec-
tors. It’s well worth a read. As ever the
comments section is a great source of
amusement, expect for Imperial Girl. I
wish she would curl over in a ditch and
die. She is so annoying and if anything
angers every one of my female friends
greatly. She is so arrogant to think she
is the correct representation of female
students at IC. grrrr
Another thing brought to my atten-
tion is that the student nightlife at the
union has increased considerably. This
term has been a lot of fun with lots of
events going on. Also the American
students from our affiliate universities
help make the atmosphere more in-
teresting. For example the superbowl
night was so much fun. Not because of
the game – NFL isn’t my cup of tea –
but because of the mass snowball fight
that engulfed Prince Consort road.
I can’t wait for RAG week to start. I
heard there is laser tag in the Quad on
Wednesday evening, during the RAG
Raid after party. AWESOME!!!
Only thing left so say is keep collect-
ing the top trump cards, and at some
point I’ll make the backs for you.
