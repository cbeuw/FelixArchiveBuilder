to remember. Here are a few (some al-
ready used in Vista):
Win+p
• : opens the projector
menu
Win+m
• : minimises all windows
Win+Shift+m
• : revert all window
minimisation
Win+d
• : shows desktop
Win+Home
• : minimise all but the
current window
Win+Tab
• : Flip 3D
Alt+Tab
• : cycle through live win-
dow thumbnails
Win+t
• : cycle through live applica-
tion thumbnails on taskbar
Alt-Esc
• : cycle through all open
windows
Win+g
• : brings all the Gadgets
above all windows
Win++
• and Win+-: zoom in and
out of the desktop (OS X has this
feature since the Dark Ages!)
Here’s a list of the less exciting yet can
be useful extras in Windows 7:
a built-in ISO disc image burn-
•
er, thus eliminating the need of
third-party archive or disc image
software
Internet Explorer 8
• , which seems
to be a late clone of Mozilla Fire-
fox 3 really so nothing exciting
Device Stage
• – a tool that makes
connected devices look fancy in
Windows
Aero Shake
• – lets you minimise
other windows by shaking the
current window with a mouse,
but this doesn’t work for me all
the time
Font management is neater with
•
stacked views of each font family,
as well as a preview of the font on
the icon
Verdict (so far)
Windows 7 seems to be quite promis-
ing so far, especially with the tweaks
that make Vista look stupid. My three-
year-old ThinkPad had crashed a few
times after my several attempts to run
the Windows Experience Index assess-
ment, but apart from that I haven’t had
any problems at all on either laptops
(no blue screen of death for sure!). In
fact, on the MacBook Windows 7 runs
almost as smooth as OS X. It even
wakes up straight away from standby,
which before Windows 7 this was an
OS-X-exclusive feature.
Many reviewers complain that Win-
dows 7 does not have enough new fea-
tures to be qualified as a brand new OS,
but I beg to differ: given that Windows
7 runs so much better than Vista with
what it has right now, I wouldn’t want
any extra premature features to ruin
its stability. However, I would agree
that Microsoft should make Windows
7 cheaper than what we had paid for
Vista, to make up for the pain we suf-
fered back in the early days. I say drop
Zune and use the remaining develop-
ment money to give us all the discount
we deserve!
I do have one confession to make: my
original plan was to also test Windows
7 on a netbook (an Acer Aspire One) in
this week’s felix, but due to the heavy
snow last week the delivery is delayed,
so I’m afraid I will have to delay the test
till next week, provided that the net-
book arrives before Wednesday. Un-
til next time, why not try Windows 7
yourself? Any machines released in the
last two years should work fine (check
with the list of minimum requirements
on the previous page). Intel-Mac users
should definitely try it just for fun!

your impression so far? Drop us an

Start Menu with minor update
The Start Menu in this beta build is
pretty much the same as Vista. The
only update is the additional recent
documents list for each application
– same as the taskbar buttons really.
Another change is that the power but-
ton at the bottom right is now labelled
“Shut Down” by default, instead of a
misleading round circle that turns out
to be standby in Vista. If you prefer
Vista’s default setting, you can change
the button by simply right-clicking it,

W
hen Windows Vista
first came out back
in November 2006,
I thought, “Wow!
(sic) At last! Some-
thing that can fully replace the dull
Windows XP.” Unfortunately, I was
wrong: not only did the first release
of Vista consume too much system
resources, but the manufacturers also
failed to deliver compatible drivers for
hopeful upgraders, thus rendering the
“Vista Capable” labels meaningless.
Today, Vista is a lot more stable with
Service Pack 1 (and personally I am en-
joying the ride too), but many consum-
ers are so afraid of Redmond’s obese
OS, that they’d rather go through all
the trouble to downgrade their new
computers to XP. If you are one such
person, then you should read on to find
out why Windows 7 will be different.
Windows 7: Vista on diet
Eagle-eyed readers may have already
noticed that Windows 7’s full version
number is 6.1.7xxx, meaning it is based
on Windows Vista (6.0.6xxx). This
traces back to the changes Microsoft
made to their OS roadmap, when they
had to focus on patching Windows
XP’s major security vulnerabilities in
2003, thus splitting the originally-sin-
gle OS release into two parts. Perhaps
it was also this rush that made Vista a
badly polished product, so Windows 7
is given the big task to regain consum-
ers’ trust for Microsoft.
In fact, Microsoft’s recent public re-
lease of Windows 7’s beta (Build 7000)
has already impressed many critics, most
praising the smaller memory footprint
compared to Vista. Other notable im-
provements include the optimized task-
bar, smarter windows management, less
annoying notifications etc.
From XP to 7: cannot upgrade
My first testing platform was a Lenovo
ThinkPad X41 Tablet – a three-year-
old laptop that has the rare touchscreen
feature, perfect for testing Windows
7’s compatibility and its tablet func-
tion. To keep the test fair, I installed a
vanilla-copy of XP Tablet PC Edition
2005 SP3 along with the essential driv-
ers (no Lenovo crapware apart from
their “System Update” tool), and then
the same was done with Windows 7.
As expected, Windows 7 did not allow
a direct upgrade from XP; you can only
do so with Windows Vista SP1, so be
warned!
Installation was a breeze overall - the
only user inputs required all took place
at the beginning, and then just half
an hour later I had the new OS run-
ning (but with missing drivers). Once
the drivers were loaded, Windows 7
still had a pretty impressive boot time
(from power on to appearance of desk-
top) of 1 minute 31 seconds, just 9 sec-
onds more than XP.
Smarter taskbar
Upon first login, you may not be im-
pressed by the same eye candy seen in
Vista, but do bear in mind that this is
still a beta release so the graphics may
not be final. However, what caught
my attention first was the revamped
taskbar: it is now thicker, and by de-
fault there are already three buttons
docked. At first I thought they were
just ordinary quick launch buttons, but
with a bit of fiddling, I discovered that
dragging the buttons upwards reveals
a menu, showing shortcuts for the rel-
evant programs (this is a “Jump List”),
option to “pin” a shortcut to the top
of the list, and shortcuts to web book-
marks, recent documents and playlists,
if supported.
In fact, the above features also apply
to any docked buttons on the taskbar,
so if you open any applications, their
taskbar button will always have a list
of recent documents, and you can also
pin a shortcut. This effectively turns
the ordinary Windows taskbar into a
beastly cousin of Mac OS X’s dock.
However, since the ThinkPad’s
graphics chip is not powerful enough,
Windows 7 has automatically disabled
the more advanced Aero features (in
short: the fancy graphics as seen in
Vista). This is why I prepared a second
machine to play with: my lovely uni-
body MacBook.
Again, installation was very straight
forward using Boot Camp, and all the
Vista drivers on Apple’s DVD worked
straight away. Now the taskbar buttons
show a preview panel when clicked on,
and you can hover over each thumbnail
to highlight the associated window,
while the other under the stack be-
come transparent. Pretty cool, eh? Of
course, clicking on the thumbnail will
bring you that window to the front.
On the right hand side of the taskbar
are the usual notification and system
monitor icons (power, network and
volume), but now with an additional
flag icon which reveals an “Action
Center” box - a neat replacement of the
old intrusive balloons which are much
hated by XP and Vista users. Other
application icons can be revealed by
clicking on the triangle to the left of the
Windows 7 - hope or flop for M$?

Win7 Trivia
Boot screen of Windows 7
A Jump List above the taskbar
flag, and you can still customize them
to make them appear in the icon area
instead of just the notification box.
Since the taskbar is now thicker, the
clock now conveniently shows both
the time and date, unlike the old days
when you had to hover over the clock
to show the date (which disappears af-
ter five seconds). Further right sits a
blank, thin button which simply does
“Show desktop”. This button used to be
in the “Quick Launch” list right next to
the Start Menu, so some may struggle
to get used to this new layout.

With Aero enabled, clicking a docked button reveals a preview panel,
and hovering over a thumbnail highlights the associated window.
and the button’s label will change to
whatever action you choose.
Themes and Gadgets
Who doesn’t personalise their desk-
top these days? To satisfy the general
users, Windows 7 will come with a
more powerful theme tool that allows
you to package several wallpapers into
one option, so that Windows can au-
tomatically cycle through them at set
intervals.
On the Gadgets front, Windows 7
has abandoned the sidebar approach
in Vista, once again igniting the Win-
dows-copied-OS-X flamewar (in OS
X, Widgets are spread across the desk-
top). To be honest, I couldn’t care less:
in Vista I only look at the Gadgets dur-
ing login, so most of the time the Side-
bar is hidden behind a stack of Win-
dows anyway.
Revved-up Tools
Microsoft has finally decided to give a
little bit of extra with Windows’ built-
in tools. Kids and bored secretaries
will be most impressed by the new
Paint, which now includes a selection
of shapes and brushes. The new inter-
face took cues from Office 2007, mak-
ing Paint easier to use than previous
versions. Another tweak worth men-
tioning is that Paint will automatically
resize the canvas to fit your pasted
image, amking screenshot capturing
much easier (just as I had been experi-
encing while writing this article).
Similarly, WordPad has also been
updated with a Word-2007-esque in-
terface, and you can even edit .docx
documents (Word 2007 file format)
but understandably losing some for-
matting. It also has Paint built-in, so
you can edit your inserted drawing at
any time.
One feature that is ignored by most
users is Windows’ handwriting recog-
nition, which is why I was very keen to
try Windows 7 on the ThinkPad X41
Tablet. Compared to Windows XP Tab-
let PC Edition 2005, Windows 7 is defi-
nitely better at reading my handwriting
as expected. Furthermore, Windows 7
will recognize at least six more lan-
guages on top of Vista’s twelve.
Networking
It took me a while to figure out where
to make a Virtual Personal Network
connection to Imperial College - with
Vista I could do so in the Start Menu,
but Windows 7 has moved it all to the
network icon on the right hand side of
the taskbar, which is slightly more con-
venient. On a higher level, the main
networking feature of Windows 7 is
HomeGroup, a protocol that is meant
to simplify how we “share files, photos,
music, and printers throughout your
Windows 7 Paint + Tablet PC = awesomeness + super fun time!
WordPad has a Word-2007-esque interface and can edit .docx files

home” using just one shared password.
In fact, the real stars of this feature are
“libraries” - essentially “a way to ag-
gregate multiple physical locations on
a computer into one unified view”, as
described by Jerry (e7blog) on blogs.
msdn.com.
In other words, say if you have three
Windows 7 computers on your home
network, then you can set up your
HomeGroup to view all photos of the
entire network within one folder on any
machine, rather than having to browse
through several network folders for
different machines. Of course, you can
vary your folders’ individual privacy
levels and read/write permissions.
Easy media browsing within a
HomeGroup is supported by the forth-
coming Windows Media Player 12 and
Windows Media Center: rather than
scanning “the entire hard drive on the
computer to find media files and add
them into a media library”, they simply
use the Windows Explorer libraries as
shared by both apps.
Auto-resizing windows
This feature should have been included
in Windows a long time ago, but it has
only been implemented by third-party
apps until now: by dragging a window
to the left or right edge of the screen,
Windows 7 will automatically resize it
to fill up that half-side of the screen,
and dragging to the top edge will max-
imise it. You can also do the same by
using a combination of the Windows
key and one of the arrow keys (the
down key restores/minimises the win-
dow). No more fiddly window-resizing
work for you!
Bits and bobs
The keyboard shortcuts mentioned
above are just four of many available
in Windows 7, and most are quite easy
