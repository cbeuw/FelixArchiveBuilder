Where the beautiful people go...
Catherine Jones reviews Beach Blanket Babylon, a fashionista paradise with Valentine’s Day potential...
I
n the deepest heart of Notting
Hill, there is a unique bar, an ele-
gant haven called Beach Blanket
Babylon. This is more than just
an overpriced hotel lobby bar.
For one night I felt like I stepped into
the fabulous fashionista world, right
into the pages of style bible Vogue.
The night began, terribly, lost and
lonely walking through the rain (cold
rain) in Notting Hill. I had made every
effort to style sleekly, aware this is a
fashionista bar, and there could be rich
and fabulous clientele. My delusional
grooming attempts were ruined by the
rain. I looked decidedly more super-
mental than supermodel.
Upon arrival, I was greeted by the
good-looking and friendly staff, and
seated in front of an open coal fire.
Inside, this probably is the chic bar of
my dreams. White walls, period glass
chandeliers, coal fires and an eclectic
selection of Boroque and Rococo style
furniture. In the corner, a colourful
curvy mosaic tile window frame, in-
spired by the famous Spanish Archi-
tect Antoni Gaudi. Soon cosy and dry,
I melted into the happy and romantic
atmosphere. Bliss.
Next; drinks. The cocktail menu at
Beach Blanket Babylon was... amus-
ingly extensive. The classics were well
represented, but the eyebrow-raising
celebrity cocktails set them apart. The
Paris Hilton Classic Cocktail (£12)
contains “a sugar lump coated in Bit-
ters & Remy Martin XO topped with
Champagne”. How apt!
We ordered the Apple Daiquiri and
the Natalia Vodinoska cocktail, named
after the famous supermodel. Both
were excellent quality cocktails, made
with fresh ingredients and top of the
range spirits. The quality was reflect-
ed in the price, in the region of £9-12
each. I have to say the service from the
friendly staff was excellent and we felt
we were getting value for money.
The antics of “Imperial Girl” and her
kind were a hot conversation topic that
night. So understandably, when the
painfully large bill arrived, we laughed
and began comical shuffling around in

LAST ONE IN’S A ROTTEN EGG
This particular Anti-Valentine’s

the flyer, or more likely, it’s the awe-
some line up. One Man Party ( That’s

BE) are playing at 333 Old Street,
Shoreditch.

ourhandbags. Shouldamanalwayspay
for dinner? Our cynical conclusion; “At
the end of the day, I think most people,
male or female, will do what they think
they can get away with”. And so, being
cheapskate students, we decided one
cocktail was well more than our budg-
ets could allow. We paid, said goodbye
to the Beach Blanket Paradise, and re-
turned back to gloomy reality.
So if Valentine’s Day is approaching,
and you have no restaurant reserva-
Swearing, dancing, drinking, Potty Mouth Disco on a Friday night.
Smartie Partie Valentine’s Day Special
“Imperial Girl
was a hot
conversation
topic that night
made all the
more relevent
when the
painfully large
bill arrived”
tions, Beach Blanket Babylon could
be for you. Forget dinner. Take her to
this opulent, romantic venue. Spoil her
with one, possibly two expensive cock-
tails (if you want to push the boat out),
and then leave early, home to bed.
Beach Bar Babylon is an official
venue for London Fashion Week. So
keep a look out for fashion soirees in
20-25th February.
