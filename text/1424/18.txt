Tamil Society’s Mega Maalai 2009
A
couple of week-
ends ago I ventured
into the far north
(of London) to The
Forum in Kentish
Town, where Imperial’s Tamil So-
ciety were hosting Mega Maalai
2009, an annual performance and
fundraising event.
The evening was hosted by Anu-
jen Vijay and Prav Mahendrarajah,
who had the audience giggling and
occasionally even breaking into
laughter with ramblings about the
joys of being male: “The world is
your urinal” and of being female:
”You don’t need to fart to amuse
yourself”.
After deciding that girls prob-
ably have a better deal in life,
they moved on to speak universal
truths such as how Dads have a
sixth sense that tells them when-
ever you’re turning the TV off
news and onto something else,
whether they’re sleeping or even
in another room, and how moth-
ers cannot let you out of the house
without a jumper or thermal vest,
even in the heat of summer.
In a very brave move, the pre-
senters gave out their own mobile
phone numbers, so the audience
didn’t have to bother shouting if
they wanted to heckle. By the end
of the evening they’d charmed the
crowd sufficiently for one audi-
ence member to send: “I want you
to marry my daughter. Meet me at
South Tooting Temple.”
Aside from thoroughly enter-
taining presenters, the evening
provided a mixture of dance and
music, a lot of which seamlessley
combined the traditional and the
modern, including a perform-
ance by Mega Melodies, who per-
formed modern music on some
crazy-looking traditional instru-
ments to great effect.
Another more traditional per-
formance was Inisai Mazhai sung
by Hari Sanker and followed by
a short fashion show, with sarees
donated by Casipillai Designs.
Though the evening was gener-
ally light-hearted, often quirky,
entertainment, there was a serious
message behind the event: Every
year Mega Maalai is held in order
to raise money for charities; this
year’s charities were particularly
close to Tamil Society’s hearts as
they were raising money for two
non-political charities working
to help those in majority Tamil
areas of the North and East of
Sri-Lanka. These areas have suf-
fered through cyclone-related
floods and civil war, with
any recovery hampered by
aid not being allowed into
these areas, or being too
dangerous for aid workers to
travel to.
After some time of reflection
about why we were there, and
some speeches on behalf
the charities being sup-
ported, it was back to the
entertainment:
The cute award of the
evening goes to a lovely per-
formance from the
Feltham dance com-
pany juniors, which
involved on of the
smallest girls I’ve ever
seen move in-time to
music, doing a very good
job of keeping up with the older
girls.
Another high point was
Radio Funkol-
ogy, who
gave a
quirky twist to
their dance routine by using a
ghetto blaster and an mp3 player
as a prop and having one of the
dancers pretend to flick through
tracks on his mp3 player. Us-
ing this gimmick they managed
to work dozens of songs into a
few minutes of dance; ranging
from the funky ‘Dangerous’ from
Michael Jackson to ‘My Humps’
via ‘Backstreets Back’!
The penultamate performance
was a medley of dances, one of
which, called ‘Gaana’, is per-
formed in vibrant costumes, with
big, billowing skirts. Gaya Gay-
athrithis Rajasooriar, one of the
performers, told felix: “Gaana’ is
an upbeat style of dance with big
movements and a lot of energy. It
was originally performed by peo-
ple who had laborious jobs, but is
now mainly done as performanc-
es in movies and shows. Gaana is
specific to Tamils as Bhangra is to
Punjabis.”
The finally of the evening in-
volved the majority of the eve-
nings performers joining in a
big performance, loosely based
around a battle , with some big
group movements and excellent
individual performances, includ-
ing one break-dancer who did an
amazing move where he dropped
onto one knee, at a speed that I’m
sure would have shattered my
knee caps!
In all, the evening was one of
fun and entertainment, backed
up by a serious message,
raising money for a char-
itable cause. All that’s
left to mention is the
particularly amus-
ing parting words
of the present-
ers: ‘If we’re here
next year, it’s be-
cause we haven’t
got jobs yet!’.
E
ach year the International Tamil Sociey selects charities to
support with their fundraising events, this year they have
chosen to support non-political organisations that work
in Northern and Eastern Sri Lanka. Predominantly Tamil
in population, these areas have suffered through natural
and man-made disasters.
Gayathrithis Rajasooriar told felix: “This is all to raise money
for charity. We’re supporting Save the Children, Tamils Health Or-
ganisation and TamilAid. The reason we’re supporting two small,
non-political charities, that work in the north and east of Sri Lanka,
is due to the fact that these predominantly Tamil areas have been
devastated by the recent cyclone-related floods and civil war and
aid is not allowed into the area so those caught up in the disaster
rely on small agencies and connections.
“At the moment, Tamil civilians are being murdered left and right.
There are fights between the Sri Lankan government and the main
Tamil rebel group LTTE that have gone on for over 25 years now.
This is the reason so many Sri Lankan Tamils now live in London,
Canada,etc. There have been protests- there was one starting from
Pimlico on Saturday where over 100,000 people came and there
will be one outside the Sri Lankan embassy, on Sri Lankan inde-
pendence day.”
The society is called the International Tamil Society, as Tamils
•
can be from India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia to name but a few.
At Imperial, most of the committee consists of Sri Lankan
Tamils.
Mega Maalai has been running for 16 years. It originated in
•
the Great Hall of Imperial College and in 2003 took place at its
first theatre (the Lyric Theatre in Hammersmith)
Last year, the event was held at the London Palladium, previ-
•
ous venues have included Hammersmith Apollo and Hack-
ney Empire.
All proceeds go to charity, which this year are Save the Chil-
•
dren, Tamil Aid and Tamils Health Organisation.
Sarees from the act with the singer Hari followed by a small
•
fashion show were donated by Casipillai Designs- she has a
facebook page.
Jimmy Nathan is President of the International Tamil Society
•
this year, his moment in the spotlight came when he crept on
to the stage to try and sweep glitter from it during the second
half of the performance.
A lot of other London Universities have Tamil Societies that
•
host similar shows. Some of the acts perform in all or many
of the shows.
Many of the acts are choreographed by professional danc-
•
ers/teachers who do the show for free.
