Fun & Games
How to play:
It’s quite simple, all numbers are in a
cell and must be surrounded with a
corresponding number lines. Lines
cannot split and there can only be
one continuous line. Any cells with no
numbers can have any number of lines.
Look at the solution above for help. (It’s
not there this week- I cocked it up).

Shotgun were again last week’s
winners. Fan-fucking-tastic. The
variety here is amazing. For the
rest of you, ‘SNOWYFUCK’ was
the obvious choice. As nobody
came to collect their Bounty bars
the editor ate them. Yes, all 50!

Going Underground
Hokays. So we fucked up. The station
was EAST HAM which we calculated
to be 59. Wrong! It actually sums to be
67. We are looking into why such an el-
ementary mistake could be made and
will get back to you shortly. As for this
week, it has been checked six times.

Oh noooo! I made a rather large pooer
of the Slitherlink last week. Why? Well
it’s simple- because I am a L.A.D. and
lads make mistakes. However I do
see it fit to apologise to you pleasant
readers and to thank teams Shotgun
and MÖchten sie mein Manschaft
for still sending in fluffed answers.
Unfortunately they didn’t score.
But don’t worry your little heads-
this week we have a fixed one to pon-
der over whilst in your lectures.
As always answers are to be sent to
sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk where
you contest and iPod nano. In case you
didn’t know there will be team and indi-
vidual winners all getting prizes! That’s
is more megaz than a mega thing!
Each letter in the alphabet is assigned a
value, 1-26 (see table) and when added
together for a specific word the sum
equals the total shown. All you have to
do is scan and send the Underground
station that is hidden each week to su-
doku.felix@imperial.ac.uk
Wordoku is identical to Sudoku;
we’ve just replaced numbers
with letters. Complete the puzzle
and then send the whole grid to
sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
You will not get credit for just the
word alone. It’s not an anagram.
RCC Nighthike Quizzy Wizzy
Here we are again in the Coffee Break,
in the midst of an exceedingly exciting
week, namely ArtsFest and RAG week.
But the fun doesn’t have to stop after
the likes of Wednesday’s RAG raid
and Friday’s ArtsFest Grand Finale,
because you’ve still got the Annual
RCC Nighthike to look forward to: one
crazy night of clue finding, adventur-
ous walking and hopefully a bit of map
reading- but don’t let that put you off,
there’s not too much!
All this is happening on the night of
28th February, and it’s now possible to
get more information or sign up your
team by logging to www.union.ic.ac.
uk/rcc/nighthike.
To get you psyched in the mean time
we’ve got a tantalising taster for you
here in the daylight safety of college-
all you have to do is answer the clues,
which are all located in places accessi-
ble to everyone in the college vicinity,
so no excuses. Last week, we brought
you questions from various engineer-
ing buildings but this week’s questions
are brought to you on the ArtsFest
theme which means that this week we
have a real live prize for the first cor-
rect entry from the lovely ArtsFest
team. Hold on!
What music-y building can also be
found to the immediate North of
Beit and the Union?
What event is taking place at 5pm
on Wednesday of ArtsFest week?
What is the name of the cafe at the
Royal College of Music?
Where is the Blyth Gallery located
(building and floor)?
Where is the ArtsFest Grand Finale
being held?
Well, if you can’t get those I’m a
monkey’s uncle, and don’t just not
write in to validate that. Here’s the
answers from last week. Well done to
the winner Enoch.
Aero Eng: Air Chief Marshall
RSM: Beit and Wernher
Mech Eng: Rt Hon. Lord Penney
EEE: 4th Floor
Skempton (Civ Eng): HAZCHEM 2S
Cylinder
Mentalist Maze...
This is a maze. Forget all the others,
they are imposters. This is the future.
Follow us. We are the real people.
The truth. The messiah. We bring
enlightenment to all. To release this
power send answers to felix and
receive a kiss from the Puzzles Guru,
Chaz Murdoch. FUCWIT eligible.

Rival
The
This year we are doing a glossy
magazine that will cover Varsity.
‘The Rival’ will be coming out at

who will cover the event.
If you’re a medical or Imperial
student and are interested in joining
the team, or have any interesting
ideas about what to do with the
magazine, send us an email:
sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk
Varsity is less than two weeks
away. The 25th is approaching.
Are you ready?
