Music Editors – Peter Sinclair, James Houghton & Alex Ashford
Alex Ashford
Music Editor
Just say ‘no’ to
silent discos
H
i. I’m Alex. I’m taking
over editing this thing
from Susan. felix is one
of the few things at Im-
perial that distracts me
from my general disenchantment of it
all and deep feelings of regret at ever
coming here in the first place. (Aww...)
Although obviously the real reason
I’m here is that I just want first dibs on
guestlist passes and promo CDs, plus I
would also like to finally have one extra
-curricular activity on my mostly bar-
ren CV.
The music section is mostly com-
prised of things that you submit, if you
want to review a gig you’ve been to or
write an opinion piece on the decline
of “real music” or anything like that,
email us. It doesn’t really matter what
kind of music you are into, we like va-
riety. If it’s the opposite of what I like,
I’ll probably just think it’s a brilliant
sarcastic joke anyway, kind of like what
Imperial Girl writes (I mean, it’s all a
joke, right?)
If you met Vanilla Ice in Boots on
Wednesday, tell us about it. If you
have discovered satanic messages on
a Beyonce track, let us know. If your
toast this morning burnt in a way that
bears a striking resemblance to Gary
Numan, show us. If Joaquin Phoenix
is your favourite rapper, write about it.
This week I thought it would be mildly
entertaining to do a “guess the album
cover” thing. If you try it, let me know
if it was really difficult or not, we might
make it into a regular feature.
I haven’t really planned anything to
talk about in this column but I am sup-
posed to make it up to 550 words. So
I am going to use this space wisely. I
want to warn you of a subcultural men-
ace, a reminder that the Darwinian
principles of natural selection does not
apply to humans and that the weakest,
stupidest, most pathetic of our species
are among us and prospering. Most
recently they struck last Friday when
a swarm of them appeared without
warning at Liverpool Street tube sta-
tion. I am of course talking about si-
lent discos/ipod flash mobs/mobile
clubbing.
They seem to involve stupid, smug
teenagers who are desperate to be part
of what they believe to be a hilarious,
shocking, “underground” in-joke. In
reality, everyone on the planet is aware
of these things, I think there was even
one on a CSI episode once. Imagine be-
ing a banker in the city, having worked
all day in a job that you are holding
onto by the thinnest of threads, finally
getting to go home, only to be stopped
and miss your train due to 12,000 peo-
ple all dancing in silence wearing ipods
(something that looks ridiculous at the
best of times) and looking at you with
a smug sense of selfish satisfaction that
they ruined your day and are “messing
with the system”. Not to mention that
they are just mimicking a T-mobile
advert. Talk about raging against the
machine there, guys.
Badly Drawn Albums
Jeniferever at the Luminaire
Rather than write a proper article I thought I’d draw some
silly pictures. Fabulous prizes will be given to the people
who get the most right, so email us your guesses: music.
felix@imperial.ac.uk. Bonus prize to anyone who figures
out my mistake, the one that’s a single instead of an album.

Jeniferever’s ambient landscapes sweep
panoramically through the Luminaire
tonight, captivating the audience with
soft and delicate charm. Fans of music
along the lines of the ethereal Sigur
Ros will certainly find here something
to cherish. Previews of songs from
their forthcoming sophomore album
certainly show a band building on
their strengths, continuing on a similar
path to 2006’s debut ‘Choose a Bright
Morning’.
Kristofer Jönson, the band’s frontman,
sways in front of the microphone with
his hushed voice floating above glassy,
glistening guitars. The mood feels ret-
rospective, the eerie ‘Swimming Eyes’
with its weeping delay drenched intro
being a personal favourite. It’s a very
strong set, interweaving old and new al-
though there is a predictable omission of
early EP material.
Certain honesty shines within the
band; the lyrics performed in English
does make their music easier to connect
to than their aforementioned Scandina-
vian contemporary, not to mention more
pronounceable song-titles. At the core,
however, they are very similar – both
produce enthralling music, building on
tranquil foundations.
It remains to be seen whether Jenifer-
ever are on the radar of TV executives,
ever more frequently using their post-
rock peers like Sigur Ros and Mogwai
to soundtrack shows. Perhaps it would
be a good thing if they weren’t; tonight
demonstrates how their music should be
enjoyed, as the full focus of your atten-
tion. After all, it would feel terribly out
of context to soundtrack Jeremy Clark-
son’s ramblings about the latest supercar
on Top Gear.
