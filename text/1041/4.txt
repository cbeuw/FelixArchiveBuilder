Clayponds
Burgled
Again
BY DIANA HARRISON
Security and well-being came
under the spotlight this week at
Clayponds, the College's resi-
dential estate in South Ealing.
Recent residents' meetings have
discussed the spate of burglaries
which have hit the sit since the
summer. Residents have exp-
ressed fears for the safety of the
students and postgraduates who
have to travel some distance to
the estate at night.
The meeting, held a week
last Tuesday, saw angry
exchanges over College's refusal
to provide a security guard. The
general feeling was that a guard
who could be on duty for a cou-
ple of hours in the early evening
- which has been identified as a
particularly vulnerable time for
the burglaries - would be a great
help. Five days after the meet-
ing, a ground floor flat on the
estate was broken into via a win-
dow, provoking calls for more
secure premises. Past discus-
sions have led to the upgrade of
the security system, including
the use of passive IR detectors.
Travel between the flats and
college has been increasingly a
source of worry for the resi-
dents, especially at night. The
path from the tube station to
Clayponds passes between a
high wall on one side and a coun-
cil estate on the other.
Harassment from children of the
council estate has caused prob-
lems for some residents, with
some students suffering stone
throwing by the children.
At the meeting, the warden
reiterated his support for the
'Clayponds Catwalk' scheme
(known as the Clayponds Escort
Service), where Clayponds resi-
dents meet each other in college
so that they can travel back to
the South Ealing flats together, a
move welcomed by staff and
students alike.
After much wrangling, College have relented on Linstead Hall's bar and allowed it to open for busi-
ness. Excited Linsteadians, keen to make up for lost drinking time, made good use of the bar, celebrat-
ing in time-honoured fashion. PHOTO: WlttlAM LoRENZ

Members of Selkirk hall were
thwarted in an impromptu bid
to raise money for the charity
Children in Need, the result of a
light hearted prank involving the
removing of some furnishings
from around the Falmouth
Keogh gallery. Included in their
haul were four tables, assorted
pictures and wall hangings, six
potted plants, a pew, two
phones and a three seater sofa.
The party carried the
objects up to the Selkirk gallery,
leaving behind ransom notes
wherever the items were filched
from. The obligation demanded
for the safe return of the items
was a Â£50 cheque payable to the
kidnappers nominated charity.
Arran, a member of the
altruistic band, said that "at the
time, it seemed the right thing
to do." Unfortunately others did
not share his views. The assistant
subwarden, Kay Goodyear,
threatened those involved with
hall fines, and they were sen-
tenced to undo their evening's
work.
