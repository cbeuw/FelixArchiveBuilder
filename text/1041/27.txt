SPORT FELIX FRIDAY NOVEMBER 1 7TH 1995 . TWENTY-SEVEN
Badminton
Ladies G o
Down
With the mysterious disappear-
ance of Szun Szun before the
game, IC's Ladies badminton
team were down to only five
players, as were Royal Holloway,
which meant that, due to the biz-
zare nature of the sport, five of
the nine matches were void.
Whilst the "smashing" form
of Mighty Mo and Crazy Chan
was not enough to overcome the
strength of RH, Blabbermouth
Bhabuta and Nippy Nakayama
played superbly to win both their
matches. Due to "technicalities",
though, these valiant efforts
proved to be in vain, as IC went
down 5-4. Never mind, blame it
on Szun Szun.
The men's side enjoyed a
comfortable 8-1 thrashing over
their RHUL counterparts.Upon
their eventual arrival on the
pitch, IC had all the early posses-
sion, but due to some fancy foot-
work from RH, and some highly
dubious umpiring decisions, they
took the lead. "Chip Shop",
though, rallied the team, and IC
forced the draw with two corkers
from "Yokel" and "Curtains".
Has anyone seen "Rab"'s pants?
IC Vth's
Comeback
IC's fifth team took on RLSB's
3rd XI last Saturday, and an
apprehensive start saw Bart's
unlucky to be only 2-0 up at the
half time oranges. A stirring team
talk inspired first Ryan to score
from a narrow angle, then a twen-
ty minute hat-trick from Nigel
turned the match entirely.
A docile 'keeping error and a
very poor last ten minutes denied
RSM II a deserved win. Two
great goals from Mauritz and a
delicate chip from Dave looked
to have given them the victory,
but an exposed lack of pace at
the back gave Wye the equaliser.
The RSM first team though
weighed in with their best perfor-
mance of the season to trounce
QMW III 4-1.
Fencers Take
Division
by Storm
Imperial's men's fencing team
clinched the divisional title on
Wednesday by beating Royal
Holloway 17-9. Previous wins
over UCI (18-9), King's (17-10),
and QMW (15-12) ensure IC a
good seeding for the knockout
rounds, and with a full strength
squad, they must be amongst the
favourites for the title.
The women's team have
fared less well, having had prob-
lems in fielding a good team.
They did manage a hard fought
victory over QMW, finally tri-
umphing 10-8. Credit is due to
Linda Little, whose dedication
this season has been noted.
IC Girls out-
muscled in
hard encounter
The time had come for IC's bi-
annual battle with Royal
Holloway. Sporting flack jackets
and helmets we ventured on
court to find that, once again,
there were to be no referees.
The new look team played
well in the first quarter to lead
8-6. Holloway caught up in the
second, though their centre
seemed to pay more attention to
the legs of IC's goal-attack than
to chasing the ball. The game
remained close until the last
quarter, when Holloway's
greater physical presence finally
took its toll, and they extended
their lead to an unassailable 34 -
25 margin.
The game was at times
flowing but Imperial were still
not hardened enough to beat
RH.

"The art of war is of vital importance to the state. It is a
matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin.
Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account
be neglected."
Sun Tzu 500 BC
"Don't neglect this marvellous opportunity for you to learn
a practical and highly treasured martial art. Surely your
life is worth more than £2.50 per lesson."
