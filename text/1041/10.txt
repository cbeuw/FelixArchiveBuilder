I
n the 1960s, people were becom-
ing worried that their thoughts,
behaviour and actions could be
manipulated by messages.
Messages that the conscious mind was
not able to perceive. Their main con-
cern lay in the commercial field of
advertising, where it was felt that the
technology existed for advertisers to
control the thoughts of television view-
ers undetectably by inserting very short
messages onto the screen. These visual
'subliminal messages' were flashed at a
speed, brightness and size that would
go 'undetected' by the audience at a
conscious level. According to leading
professional bodies, this kind of stimuli
is capable of influencing our emotions.
part said that they had experienced a positive
'feel good' factor as a direct result of the game.
A spokesman for Time Warner stated that
Endorfun may have drug like qualities, but at
least it's legal! Under the
1990 Broadcasting Act,
both television and radio
are prohibited to use sub-
liminal messages that may
"influence the minds of
persons...without them
being fully aware of what
has occurred." Computer
games however, are not
restricted by this legisla-
tion.

however, have admitted to putting subliminal
cuts of sexually explicit material into their films.
One recent release, "Jade" is said to contain
such images. Its director,
Michael Friedkin, was
also accused of using sub-
liminal cuts in his earlier
film, "The Exorcist'. In a
recent article in the L A
Times, Gene Reynolds,
the President of the
Director's Guild of
America, noted that
there are no Guild rules
about the inclusion of
subliminal messages in films. "We certainly don't
have a policy against it, it's up to the individual

exclaimed the recent newspaper head
lines as the new computer game,
Endorfun, was released. Aimed at kids
as young as 11, the game induces a i
'feel good' sensation into the player J
through the use of subliminal mes
sages. Almost 100 of these messag
are concealed within the game's
soundtrack, mesmerising the child
into a trance-like state. However,
phrases such as "I am the master
of my life", "I am divinely guid-
ed" and "I don't have to try and
please anyone else" have pro- p
voked outrage amongst parents
who condemned the game and
its producer Time Warner, the
largest media corporation in
the world. The company
openly admits that, "The
gameplay is so addictive and so
immersive, that continued play
is guaranteed." Andrea
Simpson, a spokesperson for
the American giant, remarked
that the subliminal messages are
just a "hook on the g;
marketing guys have done a very
good job!" A recent live T V test
of Endorfun demonstrated that ,.
the game did have an in
