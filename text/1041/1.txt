MP Mellor Sinks
Boat Club Plans
BY ALEX FEAKES
Plans for a new IC boathouse
were shelved this week when
local MP, David Mellor stepped
in to support complaints made by
residents. The planning commit-
tee threw out Imperial's propos-
als to extend the Club premises
on Putney Reach, against the rec-
ommendation of the Borough's
Planning Officers. IC Estates
claim that political intervention
swung the verdict ahead of the
Borough's planning policy.
Frank Murray, the Estates
Manger overseeing the project,
represented IC at last Monday's
Planning meeting. Speaking to
Felix, he said that the Councillors
turned down the application on
the grounds of 'over-develop-
ment of the site' and that the
new structure would be 'too big
for the location'. Stressing that
Imperial had worked hard to
assuage the fears and concerns of
the local residents, he was sur-
prised that problems which
College had thought resolved
were brought up again by their
local Councillor.
The plans were dismissed by
a single vote, four Labour
Councillors supporting the appli-
cation and half the Conservative
Councillors abstaining from vot-
ing. Ian Caldwell, IC's Director
of Estates, said that the result
showed that the Councillors
were putting votes ahead of sport
and leisure provision for the
Borough, highlighting 'the irony
of the situation...with the large
number of voting students living
in Putney.' There were sugges-
tions that the committee had put
political motives ahead of the
advice of their own Officers,
with sources citing the fact that
residents had petitioned the MP
for Putney and Wandsworth,
David Mellor, to influence the
decision.
In a statement to Felix, Mr
Mellor said that he shared con-
cern with the residents over an
opportunistic application for a
development of this scale in a
conservation area.' He was also
'appalled at the condition

this annual event is quite possibly the best and most popular Rag event.

into.
When asked later of his opin-
ion on the decision, Mr Mellor
said that he is 'delighted that the
balance... between the interests
of the rowing community and the
interests of the locals is not to be
destabilised.' The MP visited the
area in response to letters from
eonstituents, attended meetings
discussing the plans, and finally
wrote a letter to the Planning
Officers opposing the applica-
tion.
The extensive redesign of
the site involved enlarging the
training, changing and workshop
space in the building, including
improving the facilities for
women, presently woefully inad-
equate. Helmholtz Villa, an
adjoining house owned and leased
by the College, was to be incor-
porated into the new structure,
creating new accommodation for
the stall and some students. The
tenant of the house presented no
