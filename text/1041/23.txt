To the Editor,
The author of the piece
"Why I love killing small animals"
might have adopted a deliberate-
ly hackle raising ("numbskull")
style, but the issue is an emotive
one and such articles do little to
harbour useful dialogue between
camps or to get people thinking
at all. Comments about hunt
saboteurs were bigoted and sim-
ply rude; This was crass writing.
The point underlying the
article, however, deserves a
response. The environment, and
the resources within it, represent
both local livelihoods and a
national resource which, increas-
ingly threatened, has to be prop-
erly managed. Such management
may necessitate culling particular
populations and controlling pest
species. Bloodsports are rarely, if
at all, part of responsible manage-
ment of the countryside; and all
too easily the latter is used to jus-
tify the former. Moreover, ani-
mals cannot be considered as
simple material resources.
Animal welfare and the humane
treatment of animals are, I
believe, important issues; don't
treat animals with kid gloves -
but recognise the needs of live-
stock and wild species and ensure
suffering (and environmental
damage] are minimised.
What is repellent about
hunting is that it ignores these
issues; the fox is hunted for the
pleasure of the hunt. (On the
subject of stress, prey species are
alert to the threat of predation
much of the time, but the author
misses the point that stress is an
acute response; prey animals do
not habituate to the condition. It
is easy to imagine running in ter-
ror from an attacker - it is a
homologous response in the fox.
A protracted chase by a pack of
dogs and mounted huntsmen -
possibly in exhaustion - might
well be considered unnecessary
suffering.) Presumably, it is the
physical challenge of the hunt
that is enjoyed, not the kill, but
that is just as near-sighted as eat-
ing plucked, gutted and packaged
supermarket chickens - there is
no understanding of the natural
history of the fox, or any care for
it. I doubt if many members of a
hunt have a close working con-
tact with the countryside; a pro-
portion, I am sure, live in towns.
As a form of pest control, blood-
sports seem highly inefficient; let
estate managers and farmers con-
trol pest populations.
It is not a matter of wanting
a sanitised countryside of "fluffy
animals" but of striving for a
working knowledge of rural com-
munities and ecology and a
respect for animal life.

Dear Felix,
With regard to the feature in
the last issue "Why I love killing
small animals." I do not wish to
comment on whether or not
blood sports are morally or
socially defensible but rather on
the tone in which the article was
phrased.
Nearly every paragraph con-
tains an attack on the personali-
ties of these stereotypical hunt
saboteurs which has no bearing
on the actual argument which the
writer purposes to discuss.
It is unfortunate that any
vaguely political argument in the
pages of this newspaper or on the
wider national scale is reduced to
a person jibe at the opposition.
Greater attention to the actual
issues under discussion would
lead to a more fruitful debate and
describing one's opponents as
being "unwashed", "Greenham
Common descendants", "yobs",
"bent-double dirty faced and all
facial appendages pierced" is a
petty-minded and pathetic
recourse for those who do not
have the ability to properly
defend their stance.

I'm very happy to say that I
agree entirely with these, two let-
ters - I'm rather surprised we
haven't received more replies of
outrage concerning the article.
Would anyone care to redress
the balance with an anti-hunt
view?
Indeed, if anyone would like
to write a feature on any issue of
this nature then please come in!
We want to hear from you...
Nooman Says: M y article
was clearly an exaggerated and
seditious support of blood-
sports. Mr. Wembridge is correct
in assuming that it was hackle
raising and I praise him for
noticing that there were some
real points in there. M y aim was
to show that it helps neither side
involved in such issues to bury
any sensible points they may
have under a mountain of abuse.
I was compelled to write after
my experiences at Brightlingsea
earlier this year, where I intend-
ed to explore the issue of veal
exports objectively, and met
instead a tirade of violent
rhetoric directed not only at the
lorry drivers but also their wives
and children. The use of stereo-
types, alarmist tones and person-
al attacks should not be con-
doned by anyone.

Dear Felix,
Physics Department Blackett
Passive Smoking
With reference to your
"News Team" on the above, the
notices on no smoking were up a
week before, giving plenty of
time for comments. There are
two items I would like to com-
ment on: passive smoking and the
state of the floor. I would think it
would be a good idea to have a
notice which reads: "Please use
the ash-trays and bins provided."
Passive smoking
We agree to "Health
Damage", they are the reason
why there is no smoking in cine-
mas, in buses, planes, etc. Often
fines would be implemented to
enforce this.
State of the floor
Would you treat your home
like the floor of Blackett?
I am not against smoking,
but it is time for the college to
have a proper policy and not just
monitor for the sake of it.
Perhaps a policy to provide an
indoor, well ventilated, room for
smokers. Let the smokers have
the responsibility of keeping it
clean, not the cleaners, they have
more than enough work already.

Dear Felix,
With reference to your front
page article about the Physics
smoking ban, I must say say up
font that I am a non-smoker,
always have been, guess I always
will be. I, for one, am glad that
the foyer smoking area has
ceased to be, I could witter on
about the improvement to my
breathing etc. or regale you with
stories of others who were in a
similar plight, I could go on to
mention the relief of the cleaning
staff at not having to clean up the
disgusting mess that would con-
front them each morning, not to
mention the dangers of passive
smoking or the psychological
effect it must have had on visi-
tors to the department, who, at
times, must have thought that
they were walking into a London
"peasouper". But we are all intel-
ligent adults and know most, if
not all, of the reasons why the
ban was inevitable. However,
there is still the problem of the
smoking community who have
been left out in the cold, so to
speak. I feel that if all parties
involved got together, an answer
can be found that would respect
the wishes of both smokers and
non smokers in the department.
