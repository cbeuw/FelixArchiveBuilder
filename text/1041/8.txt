sugg* st an antagonistic and strained
relationship rather than the cosy
alliance that actually exists today.
The predecessors of Messrs. Kohl and
Chirac for centuries sought to destroy each
other, or at least stop the other becomin|||
dominant. Today they stand over , i i literal
alliance built on a foundati I directives

London does suggest the development of a

deluding himself if he hopes to ci
from the IGC with more than a sack of Brie
and some cheap wine from the French
President.
The reasoning is simple enough. An inte-
grated defence policy would have its heart in
France, and in the central bank in Germany.
Thus the hegemony that has escaped both
countries for centuries would be complete.
Their obstinate refusal to listen to pleas from
Britain and elsewhere that sovereignty would
be threatened is a consequence of their mis-
understanding of the function and definition
of the nation state.
The principle functions of a nation are
management of the currency and defence.
Delegating both of these to a central
European body eliminates democracy and

As everyone knows, it is impossible to
have a centrally managed currency whilst at

tly changed the theme without informing the
invitees. Most sensible people have no oppo-
sition to the original Treaty of Rome. Over
the last ten years however, it has been slowly
remoulded into a leviathan that is eating away
at the hearts of individual nations. The
European Parliament and Commission create
laws and directives not because they are
heeded, but because that's what they were

Western Europe they failed to see it as the

these nations have got on their feet they will

the former Communist states to join their

fry Britain to remind both France and
Germany what nationhood means and thus
reverse the drive to closer integration. The
flawed interpretation of it that Chirac and
Kohl have developed may be simply expedi-
ent as it serves their similar ideals and goals.
On reflection, it is not too difficult to see
how the two of them, impervious to outside,
criticism and pursuing a marriage destinedj*

crime?) in the world.
