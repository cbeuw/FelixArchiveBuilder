Second Fifteen
Earn First Win
A makeshift team pulled off
their first victory of the season
with a gritty performance in a
very scrappy game which was
marred by a lot of dirty play.
Superb discipline and organisa-
tion from the pack, led by Matt
"welterweight champ" Anstead,
and consistent back play led IC
to dominate Royal Holloway
from the opening whistle.
Despite the dubious presence of
Pie-eater Perks and an unknown
Kev-baller, Imperial arrived at
the break with a 7-0 lead. After
a fine John Evans try from some
well worked back-row play,
Evans himself made the conver-
sion, and from then on Imperial
always looked the better side.
The second half gave IC the
wind advantage, which they used
to good effect in pinning back a
resurgent RHUL side. A further
try, this time from Fitz von
Esser, finished the scoring,
although the result would have
been a great deal more impres-
sive if it wasn't for IC's newest
recruit from the the Royal
College of Music dropping the
ball whilst over the tryline on
two occasions (allegedly).
A superb all round effort,
for which credit must go to IC's
back row supremacy, and fine
defensive work in the backs. The
game was unfortunately aban-
doned with only minutes
remaining due to the insatiable
desire of RHUL's team members
to go joy riding in ambulances.
Ladies Continue
Winning Run
The women's football team took
an early lead through a long
range effort from Amber which
proved too difficult for the goal-
keeper to handle. Despite heavy
pressure from Holloway's girls,
IC's american goalie Kendra's
positioning was sound, and the
score remained unchanged at
half-time. After the break the
Imperial side held it's shape
well, allowing Eva to score (only
one this week?)
With a "particularly
obnoxious" coach urging RH on
from the sidelines, IC let their
concentration slip, permitting
RH's large striker through,
putting themselves under great
pressure in the worsening condi-
tions. IC's ladies held on though
to record their fifth BUSA win,
taking a 100% record through to
the second round.
Virgins Deflowered
After a somewhat lethargic start,
the Virgins found themselves
ten points behind a strong
Holloway side. Stirred into
action, the IC side fought back,
and spent the remainder of the
first half encamped in the oppo-
sition's half. This was continued
in the second half, but sustained
Imperial pressure was not con-
verted into points, thanks largely
to committed defending from
RH. A freak break minutes from
the final whistle saw Holloway
take the score to 17 - 0. By all
accounts though, the lovely
Virgins were very unlucky, and
the scoreline was a very poor
reflection of their excellent
efforts.
ICBC
win yet
again
Saturday, the fifth of
November, saw 462 crews of all
abilities compete in the four and
a quarter mile Head of the River
Race. It was dominated by the
Great Britain squad who took
the top five placings. However,
the performance from ICBC
earned a mention by the
"Telegraph" newspaper as being
"most impressive". IC's rowers
finished the day as top club with
three winners pennants, and of
these the Senior 1 coxless fours
was the fastest sweep oared
boat of the day, and included
Simon Dennis and Lewis
Atteral, who were selected for
Britain for last August's World
Championships. The other two
pennants were for the Senior 2
and Senior 3 coxed fours, the
former stroked by Pete "The
Meat" Wilson who performed
the same role in last year's vic-
tory in the Thames Cup at
Henley. To their great credit, an
IC quadruple scull finished
sixth overall, beating all Notts
County and London RC entries.
All in all, IC eclipsed the pres-
ence of all the other student
boat clubs, including this year's
Boat Race squads, and I am told
that they will improve even fur-
ther in the coming season.

England manager Terry Venables'
job looks safe tor now after a handsome
3-1 win over Switzerland in Wednesday's
friendly match at Wembley.
Australian leg spinner Shane
Warne took four for 54 as his country
beat Pakistan by a resounding innings
and 121 runs. These are in addition to the
seven wickets he claimed in the first
Pakistani innings.
