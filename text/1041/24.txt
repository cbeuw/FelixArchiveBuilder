T W E N T Y - F O U R . FELIX FRIDAY NOVEMBER 1 7TH 1 995 LETTERS
I occasionally walk through
Physics so I'm quite happy that
the smokers have moved outside
(although I haven't seen the
"crowds" that were foretold).
However, I accept that smokers
have a right to smoke - some-
where - but not near me if pos-
sible. Perhaps the secret tunnels
under IC do have a use after all
- just a thought.

Dear Simon Baker,
Apparently you are a colum-
nist, not a journalist, so you don't
need to check your facts before
writing things. If you had both-
ered to do this before writing
your column for Felix 1040 I
might have told you a bit more
about my involvement in the
'ideological sack' that is New
Solutions. I think you could safe-
ly call it more of a brief fling than
a steady relationship - I've
attended one meeting as a pri-
vate individual in my own time,
not the Union's, received a few
e-mails and most importantly,
I've actually bothered to read the
policy document concerned. I
find this makes expressing an
opinion on the subject a lot easi-
er, and perhaps if you spent a bit
more time researching and less
time indulging in scurrilous gos-
sip about Ghassan's political aspi-
rations your opinions would be a
little more relevant. Perhaps you
could manage a nice little article
outlining the policies of the two
main campaign groups - New
Solutions, who back a system of
income contingent loans, and
Campaign for Free Education,
who want a return to 1979 levels
of grants and benefits, and then
we could all share the opinions of
IC students on this one? I value
the fact that my NUS affiliated
colleagues have actually bothered
to ask a troublesome misfit like
ICU to help them on this one,
and it would be really nice if I
could do my job and represent
the true feelings of IC students
about funding. Unfortunately, I
need to know what these are
first.
As to whether sabbaticals
should be concerning themselves
with the machinations of the
NUS, unfortunately, overtly
political or not it is still the only
even vaguely representative stu-
dent body in the country. They
have to develop a realistic fund-
ing policy and get it adopted by a
political party in time for the
next election or student hardship
will become a even larger prob-
lem than it is already. I for one
do not intend to stick my nose in
the air and refuse to take part
what will probably develop into
the most fundamentally impor-
tant debate ever to affect Further
and Higher Education just
because of silly political differ-
ences. So please, let's worry
about the campaigns, not the
ulterior motives and party poli-
tics of the campaigners, who in
the end are just trying to pro-
mote an end to student hardship,
however it's achieved.
Sarah White
ICU President
Perhaps this should have
been directed at Nooman
Haque, who wrote the article in
question, but I take your point. I
myself have no great love or hate
for the NUS, but I believe it is
vital that in these times of
change for students w
e must
have a body that can represent
students on a national level. If
we do not then we must take pot
luck with government (either
Labour or Conservative) policy
and suffer the consequences.

Dear Ed,
It was interesting, even if not
reassuring, to read that the fire
alarms in Southside will continue
to be tested until the end of
November. What I am wondering
is why these 'necessary' tests
often seem to have taken pace
between five and six in the after-
noon when everyone is returning
from lectures and either wants to
get down to some work or simply
sit down and relax. Why can't all
these tests take place at more
acceptable times during the day?
It is also interesting to note
the misfortune for us students
that all the problems have start-
ing occurring and require repair-
ing and testing just as the high-
paying summer guests have left
and we have moved in.

Having enjoyed the regular
fire alarms in Garden Hall last
year I have no small degree of
sympathy for you. Yet again it
seems that Estates have handled
the issue with their usual degree
of mismanagement and prefer-
ence for conference guests over
students.
But think yourself lucky
that you have not yet endured a
drill at 8am in the pouring rain,
after a week of 3 false alarms,
just to test that the system was
working. Why is it that every
year w
e are subjected to more
false alarms? It's not what I call
progress.

Dear Felix,
I was perturbed to find, once
again, a "Hizb-ut-Tahrir" propa-
ganda leaflet in my Physics
Department pigeon hole today.
Its contents were the expected
anti-Israel, anti-democratic hot
air that this militant society con-
stantly spouts.
To distribute such material
at any time is, in my opinion, at
the least utterly misleading, but
in the light of recent events in
Israel, it is unforgivable. Yitzhak
Rabin and Shimon Peres have, in
the last few years, been treading
a treacherous path in attempts to
make peace with their ever-hos-
tile neighbours, particularly the
PLO - former sworn enemies and
terrorists. That Rabin devoted
himself to this task is only now
all too clear.
Meanwhile, the bombard-
ment of Israel by the Islamic fun-
damentalists has never stopped.
These suicide bombers, con-
vinced that their despicable acts
will guarantee them a place in
paradise, are spurred on by the
likes of Hamas and Islamic Jihad,
whose militaristic goals and pro-
paganda sound ominously similar
to those of Hizb-ut-Tahrir.
Please note - I am not a Jew,
and although I spent the first six
months of this year working in
Israel, most of the people I was
associated with were Arabs.
Some of them have become very
close friends of mine, and I know
that each of them would back me
up on everything I say here.
I am not suggesting that
Israel has never made mistakes in
its handling of some situations -
there is no such thing as a perfect
government or people. But I
would suggest that their record is
certainly no worse that that of its
neighbours; or especially the
Muslim fanatics, whose ultimate
aim continues to be the total
destruction of Israel, at any cost.
I would urge everyone at IC
to distance themselves from
extremism of any form, but par-
ticularly the violent, racist organ-
isation that is Hizb-ut-Tahrir.
Name withheld by request
I won't attempt a detailed
reply as I admit to not know
enough about the issue. But I
was saddened to see Hizb-ut-
Tahrir distributing leaflets so
soon after the tragic death of
Yitzhak Rabin, who was one of
that special breed of leaders who
was willing to sacrifice every-
thing for peace.
