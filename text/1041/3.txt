Medical School Principal Moves In
Rag Chair
Appeal Fail
BY T O M STEVENS
Richard Willis, ex-Rag Chair, has
appealed unsuccessfully against
the Executive ruling on his role
in the Rag fresher's promotion.
The event aimed to attract
freshers by handing out shots of
spirits. It all went wrong when
one over-enthusiastic student
drank too much and was discov-
ered nearly paralytic outside the
Sherfield Building.
A Union Disciplinary held
over the affair was fraught with
controversy with some claiming
it was held in an unconstitution-
al manner and even that it
should never have been held in
the first place.
In the face of criticism, Mr
Willis was found guilty of 'failing
to act responsibly as the organis-
er of an event' and of 'bringing
the Union into disrepute.' He
was fined £75 and the commit-
tee recommended a motion of
no confidence should go to
Council, a move that almost cer-
tainly would lead to Willis losing
his position as Rag chair.
Mr Willis instantly took the
story to Felix with claims of mis-
conduct, and further that he had
been expelled from the Union, a
claim Sarah White , later
described as "absolute bollocks
...there was no question of him
being expelled."
Mr Willis resigned his chair,
pre-empting a possible vote of
no confidence and sought an
appeal. Unfortunately for Willis
the appeal committee which
met last Friday failed to find
fault with the original ruling;
however it did concede that the
fine was excessive and agreed to
reduce it to £40.
Mr Willis was quoted as say-
ing that the second hearing 'was
very fair'. He accepted the
board's recommendation to
reduce his fine and agreed to
abide by their decision.
The leaderless Rag Com-
mittee elected John Lambert as
their new Rag chair on Wednes-
day, just in time for Rag Week.

IC Conference Centre staff are
reallocating bookings to other
parts of college. The Southside
suite will cease to function at
Christmas to make way for the
move of the health centre.
Work at the site will com-
mence within four weeks from
now. The project to convert the
basement to General Practice
specifications will be completed
by mid 1996. The changeover is
expected to be finished by
October.
Speaking to Felix, Dr. Peter
Dorward of the Health Centre
explained that the current 14
Prince's Gardens site has small
waiting rooms, narrow corridors
and many staircases making
access for the disabled very diffi-
cult. It also impedes the
stretchering of patients from the
Medical School and the National
Heart and Lung Institute, provid-
college ambulance.
The centre currently has
three nurses, four psychothera-
pists, a psychiatrist, an
osteopath, a sports and a compli-
mentary medicine specialist as
well as doctors available for con-
sultation. This, coupled with the
fact that the number of patients
(currently 60% student, 15%
staff, and 25% residents) is set to
increase to ten thousand within
two years, necessitates the move.
Talks between the Estates
department, the Health Centre
and the Health Commissioning
Agency oi Kensington and
Chelsea (the quango responsible
for funding healthcare in the bor-
ough) have lasted over a year and
recently culminated in the
announcement.
Funding was helped by gov-
ernment recognition that London
ing them with excellent teaching
and facilities.
practices are generally run down
compared with the rest of the
country. Health Centre staff say
that the building is generally in a
state of disrepair. There are
cracks and exposed wiring and
the frequent requirement for
staff to share rooms leads to an
unsuitable working environment.
All the staff participated in
the planning stages and have tai-
lored their rooms and workplaces
to their individual needs and
preferences as well as to the
functions they are going to be
used for. Dr. Dorward expected
this to allow '...people to thrive,
performance to improve and effi-
ciency gains to be made'.
The final plans, the fifth in a
series of revised and amended
drafts, incorporate a specific sec-
tion for counselling as well as a
larger waiting room.
