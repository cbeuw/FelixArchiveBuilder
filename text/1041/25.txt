Part Time Work
We require an eager student, preferably a first year, to
be trained in the art of printing. The successful can-
didate would work with the machinery (two litho-
graphs, a collator and a guillotine) of the print unit,
and his/her duties would include assisting the full
time printer in printing and finishing (collating and
stapling). No qualifications are needed, other than
being enthusiastic and willing to get your hands cov-
ered with ink!
Wages at Â£3.45 p/h.
Call 58072 and ask for
Rachel or Andy.

Great
mend it
stuff. Can't recom-
highly enough...
although that one that tasted like
flat Guinness mixed with Ribena
left me a little uninspired - per-
haps even a trifle sickly. But, hey,
it was a great Beer Festival.
Didn't they do well!
Perhaps I was imagining
things, but the attendance didn't
quite seem to be what it has
been in years gone by. Maybe
everyone was in Linstead...
I was a fraction alarmed to
see the following advert in this
month's Rasp! I think we should
be told.
Street, which was quite far
enough, I can tell you. Especially
when I discovered they've put
up all those poxy little Christmas
trees again. And tinsel too. Yuk.
Hideous stuff. How on earth is
that meant to make you feel
inspired to go out and spend lots
of money and revel in the com-
mercial spectacular? Bah
Humbug.

Now, I wouldn't like to sug-
gest that I am capable of any-
thing resembling fiscal under-
standing, but this Clinton and his
amazing expanding budget
deficit really is quite some-
thing. Surely there must be
some IC Americans out there
who could explain how the
hell you ended up in this kind
of a situation? Well?

I did stray from IC once this
week: yes, I made it to Oxford
I'm sorry sweetie, but it
really was very funny when
you came down incredulous
that anyone could fail to
notice a 6ft long rug being car-
ried out, and then discovered
that you were one of them.
How we laughed.
