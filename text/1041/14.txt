video: oasis
- live by the sea**
Oasis seem to love touring. They love the rock
'ri roll lifestyle, the hotels, the idea of throwing
televisions out of random windows because, in
liam's words, "I can pay for it," and, of course,
the gigging.
The setup is almost unheard of. Noel, lead
guitarist, stands completely still. Bonehead and
Guigs (rhythm guitar and bass guitar) stand
completely still. And Liarn, well, erm, he stands
still too. None of your Jimi Hendrix style licking
the guitar here or Mick Jagger style jerking
around on stage. Each member of the band has
a spot to which they are glued and they stay
there. It's not that they can't do two things at
once. Rather, it's the fact that, in their minds, the
show is them, not what they do.
The confidence that this band has is stag-
gering. Their cocky, "We're the best band in the
world", attitude has got them very far indeed
and they don't need to perform like circus ani-
mals to entertain their audience. Their power is
in their music. Straight rock 'n' roll - no messing
around with pop or any of its sub-genres.
The whole Oasis ethic is carried through in
this video as they tear through their seventeen
song set with the kind of confidence that only
bands who have been around forever should
have. They know that every song they play will
be received with a thousand cheers.
Liam has a rapport with the audience that
most singers could only wish for and he knows
it. He has that, "I know everyone loves me but
I'm pretending not to notice", look constandy on
his face. As usual, he dedicates 'Slide Away' to
the "ladies in the 'ouse", and 'Live Forever' to
"everyone, including me."
Noel's three song acoustic set (in this case,
two and a half due to the fact that he couldn't
remember how the last half of 'D'yer wanna be
a spaceman' went) is gentiy beautiful and yet still
powerful as it complements the electrified parts
of the concert. The finale of 'I am the Walrus'
follows an" energetic version of 'Supersonic' and
is, as always, eight minutes of organised madness.
Get this video, turn out the lights and play
it with the sound way up. Oh, and if the ceiling
doesn't collapse and you don't cause an earth-
quake, then you've not put it on loud enough.
album: coolio -
gangsta's paradise^
Just in case you haven't listened to the radio or
watched M T V for the last few months, the tide
track on this album went straight into the charts
at No.l. And it's quite good in its chilling, even
haunting groove and scary-voice lyrics. A rare
enough example of a good tune selling loads, and
a good way to shift copies of an album.
Unfortunately, the album doesn't live up to
its tide track. A host of special guests provide the
odd good moment, but most of the time the
backing tracks are badly done or just copies of
the original R&B and funk tracks.
Coolio seems to have forgotten his rap sen-
sibilities. The old school influences are apparent
but he has lost his flair. Only the tide track and
tracks such as the group jam, 'Exercise Yo
Game', rise above the tedium. Buy the single and
save your money for albums by the guests
instead. (4)
albums: round-up
Squeeze - 'Ridiculous'. There's nothing really
wrong with this album except that it is a little
boring. It's the same old pop formula; tried, test-
ed and old hat. It's a shame 'cos they used to be
quite good. (4) - Lucas
Various - 'Planet Dub'. Children of the Bong,
Astralasia and Eat Static all contribute excellent
ambient soundscapes. Unfortunately, the rest of
this double LP is monotonous with never chang-
ing bass rhythms. (5) - Mr. Happy
Next Step Up - 'Fall from Grace'. A pretty bor-
ing metal album. The band play confidendy but
there is little variation while the singer sounds
like he had a bad case of sore throat during the
recording sessions. (4) - Ian
Various - 'Triphoprisy IF. This compilation uses
the tactic of having remixers (e.g. Portishead)
who are far more famous than the original artists.
It's worth it because this a nice warm up record
for any night out. (7) - Pixel
