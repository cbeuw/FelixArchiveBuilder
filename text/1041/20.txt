IQ - Imperial
Queers
On Tuesday 21 Nov, IQ welcomes Matthew
Parris to its meeting to talk about his life, as
an MP and now as a political journalist. He
has written a number of books about politics
and has appeared on television and Radio 4
more times than Ned Sherrin (well almost).
Now an openly gay man, Matthew
Parris was a backbench Tory MP, and some
people say that he came out during a speech
in the House of Commons. But what is the
truth about this, and did anyone notice?
Find out how accurate political rumours are
and hear what it is like working at
Westminster. Brown Com. Room, 7.30pm.

Leonardo (Fine
Arts) Society
Leosoc, as it is known by its members, is
aimed at those of you who are artistically
inclined... or wish to be] We provide art
classes to anyone who is interested. You DO
NOT have to have any previous experience
in art... trust me! That's what we're here
for... to teach you. At the moment we're
doing mostly sketching and painting in
acrylics. We hope to be getting water
colours soon. Every now and then we have
other other events such as glass blowing (had
it just week), silk painting, batik painting,
origami, etc.
The classes are held once a week,
Tuesdays 5.30 to 7.30pm, in Civ Eng 101.
We have had requests for lunchtime classes,
but unfortunately that is just not possible
with all the time constraints. We have also
had requests for Thursday classes. If you're
interested in the Tuesday classes, just turn
up. If you are interested in the Thursday
classes, sign up on our noticeboard (#49
along the Sherfield walkway) and we'll start
classes if there is enough demand.
Membership costs £4 for IC students
and £6 for staff and others. This goes to
buying art materials for the classes. Each
lesson costs £2 which goes to paying the art
teacher.
