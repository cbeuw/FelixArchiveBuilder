On board Egypt Air flight 786 to Sanaa we
get rather primitive graphics on screen showing
the plane's progress. It seems to emphasise the
apparent corifiision surrounding the area to
which we are going; at various stages the map is
of Europe and the Mediterranean, then Africa,
then Asia, with our location each time appearing
as a dot in the corner as it approaches Yemen.
Be^»'to..paBks»M--"Y^saat|r|ie into land as every
woman on the plane begins to whip out heavy
shawls and veiling'; Those who were already
•modestly covering their hair are translonned
info amorphous black Dartir \V|der style
icreatures, and. even those who wer# flouncing
:
around in a fairly lilx'rated lashion color all their
; bright clothes to leave only their faces showing.
We are leh with the rather intriguing sight of a
long black shroud with a pair of three-inch white
stillettos peeping Oht from underneath, and a
f&ihy -plastic, ..lindb^tfirbvvn over the bit I
presume'lShe^!
Su1der. Begin to panic I will get
stones thrown at me in die street.
The poor excuse for an airport is actually a
large bam full of people, chiefly men wearing
skirts and camouflage jackets. Perhaps more
alarmingly, they all appear to have daggers
hanging in a faintiy phallic fashion from then-
belts. I am soon to discover that these provide a
massive amount of conversation as status
symbols amongst the young men of Yemen. As
they laze around during the afternoons, ritual
knife one-up-man-ship (dagger envy?) is very
definitely the order of the day. "Hey, have you
seen the length
of my blade?
It's got a three
inch curved
tip!" "Yeah, but
just look at the
jewelled hilt on
mine!"
Thoughts of
"is it entirely
wise to turn up
in one of the
lesser Gulf
States at 10 pm
with nowhere
to stay?" are
swept away by the spectacle of the situation:
everyone seems to know each other, and their
friendliness is quite remarkable. Someone has
found a thick, expensive looking wallet in
immigration, and the shouted exchanges across
the clatter of the baggage carousel try to establish
whose it is. The general consensus seems to be
that it is ours: clearly only a stupid Westerner
would lose such a thing. We have to enter into a
fairly heated discussion before we are able to
persuade the assembled crowd that we don't
want it.
Somehow, an hour later we find ourselves
happily clrinking tea with Izat, the proprietor of
a 400 year old converted palace, paying a rather
less grand $4.50 to be put up for the night. He is
alarmingly friendly, though perhaps not really
what we had in mind for the typical Yemeni: we
want to talk about the local politics and about
Arab culture, he wants to discuss the Princess of
Wales. We ask to hear of the struggle amongst
the Saddam-led states, he wants to know about
George Michael's recording contract.
The whole experience is tempered by the
huge amounts of qat we are pressurised to
consume. It seems Middle Eastern ways of
getting ones' kicks require rather more effort and
endurance than we Westerners have come to
expect. There's none of this injecting with the
purified material: here you're expected to chew
whole branches
of leaves for
hours on end,
until you've not
just got the
hallucinogenic
effect, but a very
stiff jaw as well.
The pleasant
feeling has to be
weighed against
walking around
all day with
tennis ball sized
pockets of the
stuff tucked into
a swollen and distended cheek.
Still, we get to hear more about the country,
and Izat gets to catch up on George's deal with
Sony.
