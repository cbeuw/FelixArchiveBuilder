living on the Reach objected to
the increased student presence.
The Boat Club coach, Bill
Mason, said that he was 'very
disappointed' with the decision
after all the that the rowers and
the College had done to meet
the residents objections. He stat-
ed that space was tight already
for the rowing club's hundred
regular members, with 'the vari-
ous squads having to work on a
rota system to ensure that they
all got adequate training. The
current arrangements, especially
for women members, were 'far
from ideal', changing areas hav-
ing to double as gyms for fitness
work.
Mr Mason felt that issues

felt that if the residents 'came
and observed what [the Boat

success of the rowing teams so
far.

Mr Caldwell added that he
still thought that IC's scheme
was workable, and that the
College would lodge an appeal
against the ruling.

Embarassed Union Officials were
called on to explain how Imperial
College Union's front-doormat
disappeared from under their
noses on Wednesday night.
The mat went missing
moments after midnight, when
Union stewards were in the
throes of clearing the bar of the
midweek sports crowd.
Da Vinci's had been full of
sportspeople drinking after their
BUSA sports matches against
Royal Holloway College, many
clubs inviting their opponents
back to the Union. Video footage
from security cameras and gate
stewards confirm that a huddle
of Royal Holloway sportsmen left
Beit Quad, carrying one of their
drunken compatriots in a bundle,
at four minutes past twelve. The
film clearly shows that both
Sarah White (ICU President)
and at least two union stewards
were present at the time.
Sarah said that shortly after
the Royal Holloway team had
left, concerned students alerted
her the absence of the doormat.
However, the stewards on the
exit said that they did not
remember any large item of floor
covering walking out of its own
accord, or being assisted by any
person.
Miss White was angry with
the villains, saying that she 'found
it hard to believe that anyone
would want to take such a smelly
and dirty piece of foot mat.' She
urged the pranksters who stole
ICU's front doormat on
Wednesday night to return the
item.
Sticky Wicket for
Minister
John Selwyn Gummer, Secretary
of State for the Environment,
marked the official state opening
of Parliament on Wednesday by
visiting Imperial College as the
guest of the Conservative
Society.
The Essex MP touched on
subjects ranging from unmarried
mothers to rail privatisation, but
was in particular quizzed on
'green' issues. On the topical
item of nuclear testing he curi-
ously felt that the French, by
continuing to test nuclear
weapons in the Pacific were "sig-
nificantly contributing to the
largest aid to freedom this centu-
ry-"
Speaking on environmental
concerns closer to home, he
picked out the privatised water
companies for special praise, and
blamed poor air quality in Britain
on continental traffic fumes
blown across the channel.
