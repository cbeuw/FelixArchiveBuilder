BICYCLE PARKING
There are facilities on campus for
the parking of bicycles. However, it
is clear that whilst provision has
been increased there is still a need
for more. We hear that there are
plans to put bicycle rocks by the
side of the Physics department and
in Beit Quad. Here we publish a
map showing the positions of cycle
parking facilities existing at the
moment.

BUILD
On Sunday 9th March, in the
Union Dining Room, the Imperial
College Model Aircraft Club will be
holding a sponsored model build.
A team of select modelling
geniuses will try to construct a
Cambria Eagle R / C glider kit,
which has been kindly donated to
us by the manufacturers, in less
than twelve hours. We estimate
that it would take an average
modeller of normal incapability
about one week to complete the
task under standard conditions.
Sponsorship is per minute under
twelve hours taken to finish the
aircraft with a limit in case some-
one wakes up and manages to
finish it in ten minutes. If anybody
out there would care to sponsor us
(all proceeds go to Rag) then see
a member of ICMAC.
