M U L I U J Y I V I
Pictured below is the multigym
which is now in complete
working order and is kept in the
Sports centre on the Northside
of Prince's Gardens. It is a ten
station machine, i.e. ten people
doing different exercises for
different parts of the body cann
work at the same time.
It is not just for the sportperson
but is also very good for
physiotherapy needs. It is very
good for keeping fit for B O T H
sexes and can be used by anyone
from the weakest to the
strongest.
For the moment only you can
use it for 15p a session but those
wno use u mure man a lew nines
will be encouraged to join the
Weights Club, (fee £1) and it is
then free for their use,
(membership available from
Mike Weiner C C D 2 or Steve
Gunn Chem PG).
It is very straight forward to use
but if you aren't sure then
contact either of the two above
or myself and we'll show you.
Suki ( A C C Chairman)
P.S. If yoy think it would be a
g o o d idea to have the spcrtc
centre (swimming pool,
squash courts, weights room
and multigym) open on
Sundays then PLEASE sign
the petition next to the cash
till in the sports centre.

FOUNDATION GRANT
A grant of £17,000 over five years has
been awarded to Imperial College by
the Wolfson Foundation to establish
a support unit for research groups at
the College working on industrial
applictions of microprocessors. The
unit will be established to make
available improved facilities to those
groups which requie access to a
range of suport equipment that
cannot be provided at departmental
level. T h e unit will provide equipment
to function at the microprocessor
'system' level and will form a focus of
expertise based on a central pool of
support equipment. It is planned that
the unit will have a director and two
r e s e a r c h assistants a n d will be
l o c a t e d in t h e d e p a r t m e n t of
Computing and Control; its equip-
ment will include a n u m b e r of
u n i v e r s a l e m u l a t o r s a n d l o g i c
analysers.
