The fact that IC students are generally
apathetic toward live entertainment at the
college has been apparent for sometime.
This, couple with the fact that Sunday
nights gig was not advertised outside
College, paved the way for yet another
calculated flop.
About two hundred paying punters
braved the clinical confines of the Great
Hall in order to watcn The Smirks and
The Charlie Parkas. The Smirks made a
legitimate attempt to rouse the small but
enthusiastic attendance with a set that
owed more to youthful enthusiasm than
to startling musical prowess. Still, they
were well received, and considering the
sterile atmosphere of their platform,
managed to evoke a warm response.
The Charlie Parkas, (aka the Albertos)
as if ffected by their surroundings, gave
what, by their standards, was a lack
lustre performance. 'Going through the
motions' I think you could have called it.
Not bothering with the theatrical props
that are usually such a feature of their
act, instead they m e a n d e r e d lamely
through a bunch of limp songs, the only
real humour coming in the preambles.
After about forty minutes, this writer,
suffering from acute boredom decided to
look for edible refreshment. O n my return
some five minutes later, I was refused
readmission, by a self-styled security man
(bouncer to you), my crime being that I
was armed with two packets of potato
crisps (for the interested reader one was
ready salted and the other was beef 'n'
onion) crisps I was told, were not allowed
in the auditorium. I faced a dilemma: was
I to sacrifice the crisps in the name of
rock ' n ' roll, or r e a c h B u n t e r e s q u e
proportions and scoff the lot? I ate the
crisps, the band played on.

P A Y ! — a satirical farce.
"We Can't Pay? We Won't Pay!"
will be performed in the Union
Concert Hall each night from
Tuesday 11th March to Saturday
15th. Each performance will begin
at 7:30pm, and tickets are priced
at £1.00.
How would you react if, on your next
trip to Waitrose, you discovered that all
their prices had d o u b l e d overnight?
Would you simply accept the situation, or
would the rise be just too much?
Dario Fo, in this much acclaimed farce,
gives his own o p i n i o n of how two"
everyday Italian couples might have acted
in the C o m m u n i s t Party era of the
seventies. The country gripped by raging
inflation, our characters' emotions run
high, to the point where they feel they
can justify what they once thought to be
criminal acts.*.
T h e play is certainly a comedy, but
asks many serious questions about the
morals of capitalists, communists, the
trade unions, police farces, and indeed sill
who wield power. Apparently, the only
way in which the individual can fiqht
rights is to take the law into his own
hands
"We Can't Pay? We Won't Pay!" was
first performed in this country at the Half
Moon Theatre in 1978, and the Imperial
College Dramatic Society's production
will be its second revival. Dario Fo's work
is not well known in Britian, although he
is highly successful in his own country.
Another of his farces " T h e Accidental
Death O f A n A n a r c h i s t " is currently
playing at Wyndhams in the West End.
