There are three major election
programmes on I.C. Radio in the coming
week. The first is tonight when we take Steve
Marshall, Lars Wembero- Mailer and Paul
Williams, the candidates for FELIX Editor, to
Stan's Bar and let you ask them questions live
on I.C. Radio. The programme starts at
9.00pm and is hosted by Chris Dalton.
On Sunday at 8.30pm we do the same with
John Passmore, Barney McCabe and Mick
Berry, the Presidential Candidates. This
programme is presented by Alan Burton.
Both of these 'Viewpoint Election Specials'
are designed to give you the chance to ask
questions to the candidates in the informal
atmosphere of Stan's Bar.
The third programme is on Thursday, the
day of the Results U.G.M., and in a joint
adventure between STOIC and I.C. Radio, we
will be covering the meeting. Be assured that
if you cannot be at the meeting then you can
hear the results first by listening to I.C. Radio
or by watching STOIC. The I.C. Radio
programme is presented by Simon Milner in
the studio and Dave Fuller in the Great Hall. It
starts at 12.00 midday and the links with
STOIC and the meeting begin at 1.00pm.

SOCIALIST SOCIETY
O n T h u r s d a y 2 8 t h F e b r u a r y , a
member of Plaid Cymru's parliamentary
research staff gave a talk to IC Socialist
Society.
H e talked mainly on the historical
development of Plaid C y m r u , the Welsh
Nationalist Party, and in particular its
relation to socialist ideals. His view was
that Plaid Cymru will become a more
socialist party.
Questioners from the audience asked
mainly why he did not think an all-British
c a m p a i g n f o r s o c i a l i s m w o u l d be
favourable to a Welsh socialist state,
which he answered by saying that he did
not think any London based party or
state could ever be truly socialist, and
that there was a widespread and deeply
felt sense of national identity in Wales,
a l t h o u g h h e d i d n o t s e e w h y an
i n d e p e n d e n t W a l e s s h o u l d weaken
British trade union solidarity.
T h e outlook for Wales, he said, was
bleak, with a p o s s i b l e fifty percent
increase in the jobless total ahead. He
spoke of recent political developments
i n c l u d i n g the f o r m a t i o n of a W e l s h
Socialist Republican Movement in the
wake of the Devolution fiasco, drawing
its members from most Welsh political
parties. H e a l s o s p o k e of a labour
p a r t y / t r a d e u n i o n attempt t o refloat
the issue of Welsh home rule.

I C C A G
Well, I think it must be mentioned
that last Friday we had a very enjoyable
t i m e w i t h t h e B i r k e n h e a d s c h o o l
children and though there was no real
need for volunteers to help out as we
had enough there is a need for you to
suggest other groups of kids we can
take out! Again Monday dinnertimes
or T u e s d a y s at 5:30pm, third floor
Union Building.
A s thoughts of summer enter our
l i t t l e h e a d s we s m i l e ( b e f o r e we
r e m e m b e r e x a m s ) a n d if y o u know
definitely that a sixteen week long
holiday is going to bore you stiff then
get away from it all. If like me you
have difficulty getting 'ordinary' jobs
t h e n try v o l u n t a r y w o r k b e c a u s e
everyone wants someone to help out
for little pay. Meanwhile you spend,
say, long hours in the gentle British
s u m m e r c o u n t r y s i d e at an o l d or
young people's home, and if you are
the sort that gets worried easily by
world events these homes are mostly
out of the major fallout zones so you
only get a natural suntan. Attracted?
The work, I say 'cos I know, is very
very easy.
Meanwhile, back in the big gritty.
We still would like you to volunteer for
just about anything you've spare time
a n d i n c l i n a t i o n for. if y o u ' r e i n t o
stirring soup and chatting in Falmouth
kitchens for an hour or so on Tuesday
a n d F r i d a y e v e n i n g s t h e n S u n i l a '
Nimalasuriya will show you how it's
done and later at 10:30pm you may
even feel like doing the souprun.

U n i o n ' s n e w e s t s o c i e t y , I m p e r i a l
C o l l e g e P o s i t i v e A l t e r n a t i v e s T o
Abortion Society (PATA), following a
long gestation and despite attempts by
opponents to bring about a premature
end to it.
P A T A e x i s t s to b r i n g t o g e t h e r
s t u d e n t s w h o believe that the 1967
Abortion Act takes away the rights of
the unborn child. It intends to use all
the d e m o c r a t i c m e a n s available to
campaign against the 1967 Act and
the Union's present policy on abortion.
P A T A is not just fighting abortionism.
It aims to persuade the Union to actively
support the provision of better maternity
- rights, to join campaign against cuts
in nursery places and to support the
provision of facilities to allow more
h a n d i c a p p e d p e o p l e to h a v e the
opportunity of higher education.
Membership of P A T A is open to all
students whatever their polit cal or
religious beliefs. If you are interested
then c o m e to the next meeting o n
Wednesday 12th March at 1:00pm in
Chemistry Lecture Theatre E or contact
Sean Kelly, Chemistry 2.
