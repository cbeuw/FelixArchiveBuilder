Gravel at Harlington might
well provide a golden op-
portunity for IC to have a
sports centre.
GIVE US
OUR
SPORTS
CENTRE
T h e rather low, flat t o p p e d sports
centre in Princes Gardens was originally
designed to be a multistorey sports
complex. The foundation for this building
underly the present building, however,
financial restraints at the time of con-
struction prevented the upper stories
from being completed.
T h e college has the resources to
complete the complex if it desires. These
resources are not held by any financial
house but rest three meters below the
green turf of Harlington, in the form of
some twelve meters of very high grade
gravel. Money for old stone? (Just cast
your eyes 500m west of Harlington to the
v e r y p r o f i t a b l e m i n i n g o p e r a t i o n . )
Certainly these gravels were deposited in
the underground bank approximately one
million years ago a n d their value has
definitely increased.
Exploitation of these gravels would
provide the college with more than
enough capital to build and equip a sports
centre extension.
The college can not be seen to be a
profit making organisation, however, a
major aggregate p r o d u c e r c o u l d be
contracted and the college would receive
royalties with no capital outlay. T h e
following facts have been verified by
economic and mining consultants.
The gravel which underlies Harlington
sells at £3.50 per tonne. If a contractor
was employed to remove it the college
may expect 35-60p per tonne royalties.
One of the most valuable commodities in
Greater London at present is a big hole in
the ground. Building and civil engineering
firms pay heavy duties to dump their
INERT waste close to London. Harlington's
position close to inner London, and its
proximity to the M4 make it ideal for the
dumping of inert refuse and transport of
excavated gravels.
The only inconvenience to college and
students would be the loss of some
pitches (no more than 25% would be out
at any one time). However, this effect
could be minimised by careful management
of the type and position of pitches, IC teams
playing more away fixtures (some colleges
do not have any pitches and play all their
matches away). It is rare that all the
Harlington pitches are used simultaneously.
Many aggregate contracts possess land for
some time after reclamation; if there was the
demand for more pitches it would be
possible to use this on a temporary basis.
Completion of the work would take three
or four years and would raise at least
£500,000. A s the land is considered to be
grade one agricultural land, there would be
no problem in returning the land to its
{original state.
HOW T O V O T E
O n Monday and Tuesday you will have
a chance to vote; a vote to choose the
President, Deputy President, Honorary
Secretary a n d F E L I X Editor of your
choice.
These four posts are full-time — each
holder is entitled to a sabbatical year —
and so the holders largely shape the work
and role of the Union for twelve months.
T h e s e people represent y o u , not
themselves, s o I urge y o u to vote.
Hopefully you have met the candidates or
listened to them at yesterday's Hustings
and hence will be able to vote with first
hand knowledge. If not, read their
publicity and the manifestoes (printed in
this F E L I X ) , but still V O T E ! V O T E !
V O T E !
Voting will take place betwen 10:00am
and 5:00pm on Monday and Tuesday.
There will be ballot boxes all around
Southside, Silwood). T o vote you will
require a valid (ie white) Union card.
Voting is by the single transferable vote
system. This means all votes count. Your
ballot paper will be divided into four
sections — one for each post. In each
section the candidate of your first
preference should be marked with a 1,
the candidate of your second choice with
a 2, the candidate of your third choice
with a 3. If you don't want your vote
transferred then only put a 1, and if you
only want it transfered once put 1 and 2
only.
In each section you may abstain, by
writing A B S T E N T I O N across the can-
didates' names. Y o u may abstain in one
section, some or all sections.
F o r the election to be valid the
threshold is 25% of the membership of the
Union eligible to vote
