T h e V P e l e c t i o n b r o u g h t f o r t h the
closest election for many years, with only
eleven votes seperating the candidates o n
t h e f i r s t a l l o c a t i o n . T h i s d e f i n i t e l y
i l l u s t r a t e s t h e o v e r a l l t r e n d f o r t h e
election.
A very high quality of candidates for
the five posts means that some must fail.
But the fact that the elections were well
c o n t e s t e d s h o w s that t h e r e is a great
strength in depth within the U n i o n . M a n y
congratulations must go to the successful
c a n d i d a t e s , a l o n g w i t h v e r y s t r o n g
commiseration to the unsuccessful ones
who we must hope will persevere a n d
provide the nucleus of union members
who are so important to the continuing
success and strength of the Royal College
of Science U n i o n .
L e t ' s h o p e that t h e r e l a t i v e l y g o o d
s u p p o r t for t h e H u s t i n g s a n d R e s u l t s
U G M s continues a n d increases up to the
A G M when the rest of the officers are
elected.
There was a high R C S entry to the Great
Imperial Rag Race. In all Rag managed to sell
another 2,000 Rag Mags and they seem to
be heading towards making a profit. A t last
the indifferent attitude is going and one

Hustings U G M . K e e p your eyes open for all
the e n d of term events, such as the Deaf
