President
B y now you are probably fed up with
articles starting with " B y now you are
probably fed up with . . .", so I must
apologise for the start of this. S O R R Y .
M a n y p e o p l e h a v e e x p r e s s e d t h e i r
c o n c e r n at m y s t a n d i n g for this p o s t .
They seem to think that I a m somehow
not suited to the job. Well, I a m telling
y o u now that I have the experience, the
enthusiasm, the conviction, the A levels,
a n d e v e r y t h i n g else w h i c h the winning
c a n d i d a t e will n e e d if he is to r u n a
successful a n d fruitful U n i o n next year.
W h e n I say I have the experience I a m
referring to the fact that for one a half a
years now I have sat on the R C S U general
c o m m i t t e e , g a i n i n g a v e r y t h o r o u g h
knowledge of how committees function, and
indeed how presidents function.
B o t h C h r i s F o x a n d M a r y Attenborough
(last year's I C U President) I consider to be
ideal people on w h o m to model myself, and I
have spent many hours delving into what,
made a truly great President. I have not yet
managed to cultivate a beer gut, nor have I
managed to cultivate breasts, but I feel that
with my dynamic enthusiasm these will
come, with time. Indeed what sort of a
President is he without something standing
out. I a m n o e x c e p t i o n .
There you have it: you don't get a chance
vote for King, President, Rector, etc, so use
this opportunity wisely. C h o o s e the sort of
person you want to be up there, repre-
senting your views. I a m no creep; I say
what I believe, and I beliew in making
people's lives interesting, if not exciting. I
don't smell very bad, I don't swear m u c h
in front of ladies, and I don't always finish
my.

The next two years will be two of the •
most important years for both the U n i o n
and College. The budget will be cut by
one million pounds each year for the next
three years and facilities like refectories
and accommodation must become cost
effective. T h e U n i o n next year will be
finanaced on a per capita basis, but in the
following year will return to subvention
thus reducing the grant.
S o t h a t t h e U n i o n m a y m a i n t a i n its
p r e s e n t facilities a n d e q u i p m e n t , n e x t
year's President must be a person who is
experienced in U n i o n and College related
matters and must have the ability to lead
a n d c o o r d i n a t e the U n i o n so that the
facilities are used to the utmost.
I have been involved in I C U since my first
year and a m at present External Affairs
Officer and sit on U L U S C R Executive. I
a m also active on various committess:
Refectories,' Overseas Student, Vacation
T r a i n i n g a n d U n i v e r s i t y of L o n d o n
A c c o m m o d a t i o n Committee. These show
that I have the experience in U n i o n and
College matters to do the job effectively.
Have I the ability? O n External Affairs

issues, attend conferences and report on
them, and to produce an excellent grants
paper being studied by Rhodes B o y s o n .
Also, this year has proved to be the best
year for many for I C U within U L U .
Next year, I aim to campaign mainly on
r e f e c t o r i e s , w e l f a r e ( i n c l u d i n g a c c o m -
odation) and lecturer training. I will not
make rash election promises to become
President, but I have the ability and the
experience to work for the students of
this U n i o n , to maintain its present active
status in clubs and societies and academic
matters and to set a standard which c a n
be maintained in future years.

E N T E R T A I N M E N T S : Ents discos could be
as successful as the films, given better

could persuade College to allow removable

'big name' standing concerts.
I'm standing for President after two and a

I ask for your support.
