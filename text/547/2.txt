Dear Colin
Y o u may be interested to
hear about an incident which
occurred at about 1:20pm on
Monday 25th February when
Martin Symonds a first year
student in the department of
computing saw two youths
loitering at the rear of the
Huxley Building where a large
number of pedal cycles are
kept. Having had his own cycle
stolen from there only a few
days previously he was naturally
suspicious and reported the
matter to us.
Together with Martin I spoke
to the youths a n d brought
them back to my office for
questioning. Being dissastisfied
with their answers I sent for
the police and whilst awaiting
their arrival one of the youths
attempted to escape through
my office w i n d o w but was
prevented from doing so by
M a r t i n who hung on to the
youth's legs as he hung head
first through the window about
ten feet above ground level.
It subsequently transpires
that the youths intended to
steal a motor cycle and were in
possession of implements for this
purpose.
I am passing this information
to you for publication because
this is a classic example of the
prompt passing of information
c a n prevent a crime being
committed. We hope Martin's
example will be followed by
others and we urge students and
staff to contact us as quickly as
possible whenever they see
anything suspicious.
T h e r e is a sequel to this
incident. Two days afterwards
M a r t i n was w a l k i n g d o w n
Gloucester Road, when he saw a
pedal cycle c h a i n e d to the
railings which he recognised as
being one which was stolen some
days earlier from one of his
colleagues. A telephone message
to Kensington Police and the
stolen machine was restored to
its rightful owner.
Crime prevention is every-
body's business.
Yours sincerely

Dear Sir
I see that two hundred sheets
of A4 paper is now 99p in the IC
Bookshop. Since it only costs
69p in Unimart, this means that
either Unimart are making a loss
or the IC Bookshop is profi-
teering. Any comments?
Yours faithfully

Dear Colin/Roger
Can you kindly correct the
error in my last article (issue
546): the word is A L - L A H not
A L I - T A H and I inserted the dash
as a pause exists there.

Dear Roger
Monday's Finniston events
represented an unusual oppor-
tunity for everyone here at
Imperial College to discuss the
future of engineering with those
who endeavour to change it. Sir
Monty himself defended the
• relevance and importance of his
committee's report to students
here. It is this point that merits
laboring: the Finniston Report is
relevant to everyone who hopes
to work in British industry and no
one can afford to ignore it now.
The future of every IC student
hangs in balance — the ac-
celerating economic decline of
the last fifteen years rests
precariously by the point of no
return. Sir Monty is campaigning
to swing the balance back in
Britain's and, thus your, favour.
His grim forecasts ;and complex
solution is of vital importance to
every reader of this letter —
Y O U are the future leaders of
"Britis h Industry — his dire
prophecy is Y O U R dire proph-
ecy. It is thus your respon-
sibility to turn your attention J o
what Sir Monty is telling you.
The Finniston Report proposes
to change engineering, industry,
and engineering education in
Britain today — all these affect-
you and the significance of these
changes leave you no alternative
but to explore them. Heed the
advice of the Rector at Monday
night's panel discussion and take
the time to read the report. Find
out about its indirect and direct"
effects on you (your department
may have already begun ex-
ploring a course of change) and
formulate a knowledgeable
opinion.
Britain today is at a crossroads
and Finniston is pointing the way
ahead. Don't let Sir Monty be a
modern day Cassandra — listen,
think, and A C T — before it's too
late.
Sincerely
Rick Woldenberg

Dear FELIX Editor
We would like it to be known
that Henry Curwen (ME3) is the
Pedal Car Manager for City and
Guilds College Union. Not only
is he the manager, he is also the
mechanic and has done all the
maintenance work on our pedal
cars. Without his enthusiasm
and help, we would not now have
so many people interested in
pedalling and in the Bristol
Twenty-four Hour Pedal Car
Race. We had a great achieve-
ment at Bristol this year and this
would not have been possible
without Henry being available at
all times to complete repairs.
Therefore we would like to
express our gratitude to Henry
for all his work and encourage-
ment. Thanks.
Signed by the whole of the
C & G U pedal car team.
Dear Colin
In amongst all the argument
concerning the apartheid issue,
many people are missing the
lesson of the E G M , ie, why
wasn't it possible to obtain a
quorum, despite such important
m o t i o n s (issues w h i c h the
signatories of the petition, myself
included, obviously thought
important enough to require the
E G M in the first place). Are there
just not three hundred or so
people in the college who think*
Jhar Apartheid, N U S , etc, are
important, I think not. Are the
meetings badly publicised, or are
they%t a bad time? I think that
the answer to the first question
must be an emphatic " n o ! " ,
you'd have togo around IC blind,
and deaf not to hear about it.
H o w e v e r , I think that it is
unfortunate that the meetings
clash with Associated Studies
activities (which are deemed
important enough to attempt to
make sure that tutorials could
be arranged for other times).
Wouldn't Monday lunchtime be
better? A l s o , perhaps E x e c
N e w s c o u l d be released o n
Friday, so that would-be part-
icipants would be aware of what
they were going to discuss in
more detail (or even have it
included in FELTX). I sincerely
hope that another opportunity
will arise to discuss the Boat
Club tour to South Africa. I feel
that every opportunity should be
taken to put pressure on that
government, even if to some
people the Boat Club might seem
pretty small fry. Perhaps these
people might feel differently if
they had to work in cities miles
away from their families, seeing
them perhaps once a month, and
couldn't use many of the 'Whites
Only' amenities in the cities built
by their own sweated labour.
There have been recent reforms,
but these have b e e n mere
window dressing, and pressure
must be continued to bring about
real reform and end apartheid.
Yours sincerely

Dear Sir
T w o items in last week's
FELIX (no 546) have aroused
my wrath. Firstly, isn't it about,
time someone somewhere in
the Union actually decided on
a policy regarding sport and
then stuck to it. At the moment,
at the slightest hint of a boycott
of the Olympics there is a cry of
" k e e p sport out of politics",
whilst mention South Africa and
there is horror at the thought of
links. Come on, play fair. If you
boycott South Africa for its
oppression of the blacks, then
you must also boycott Russia for
its oppression of just about
everyone it can lay its hands o n .
O r is it a case that the people
making the noise know which
side their bread is buttered on?
Secondly, how the hell can
FELTX criticise London Student
for missing out one word, a
mistake that, I am told, was
made at the printers when we get
. . . "advising the rowing eight to
go under a different dame." and
"Last week he came face to face
with a moral dilemma; he talked
to Roger Stotesbury..." both on
the front page and, referring to
the Soccer Sixes ". . . eighteen
teams entered for the tourna-
ment (a total of one hundred and
eighty players)." on the back
page.
Yours faithfully

PS: I notice that Paul Segal of
L o n d o n Student wished to
commit suicide at IC. Since
suicide is the termination of life
surely e v e r y o n e at S t a l a g
Imperial is somewhat suicidal?
There certainly isn't much 'life'
here.
A C T I N G E D ' S C O M M E N T :
Motions to a Union General
Meeting are prepared and
submitted by individuals. Is it
therefore not surprising that
motions, tabled, such as you
describe above, conflict in
opinion and attitude? On this
issue, however, Union policy is
quite clear and was printed in
FELIX last week.
Having invited letters on the
subject of 'Sport And South
Africa' I was surprised by the
total lack of response.
