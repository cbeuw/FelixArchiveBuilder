T w o major s u r p r i s e s awaited the
second eleven players as we turned up
on Saturday lunchtime. The first was
that twelve of us had actually turned
up so we could field a full team and
an u m p i r e . T h e s e c o n d w a s t h e
u n b e l i e v a b l y d a z z l i n g whiteness of
G o r d o n B a x t e r ' s s h o e s w h i c h left
several team m e m b e r s g r o p i n g for
sriow-goggles and could well explain
the apparent blindness of our oppo-
sition's umpire!
When Dave Cornwell volunteered to
umpire the first half, the outlook seemed
very bleak indeed. This was confirmed
as our opponents dominated the first
p a r t of t h e m a t c h . D e s p i t e g o o d
defensive work by Steve Rampton, and
S t e v e L e i n s t e r , U x b r i d g e f i n a l l y
managed to score about twenty minutes
into the half. Soon after this, Martin
'Banks' Cooper demonstrated a rev-
olutionary new goalkeeping tactic when
he somehow managed to get his pads
between an attacker's stick and the ball,
^preventing a certain goal.
T h e s e c o n d half saw p e r s i s t e n t
College pressure inspired by Mike Chew
in midfield, strong forward running and
Pete Smith's constant shouts of 'Keep it
tight'. W e m a n a g e d to s t r e t c h the
U x b r i d g e d e f e n c e but unfortunately
could not find the final shot. In attack,
Uxbridge were frustrated by the close
attention and sharp tackles of Gordon
Baxter and Andy Stroomer and apart
from several moments of blind panic
were unable to cause Martin Cooper any
trouble.
After the game, we got revenge f o r '
our defeat by directing Pete Smith's
rendition of 'Puppy Love' towards the
visitors' c h a n g i n g rooms! Obviously
distressed by this horrible torture, our
opponents left without accepting their
jug. This left us with little alternative
but to take up the spoils of victory!

On Sunday 2nd March, IC took part in
a XV a side tournament held at the
Civil Service ground in Chiswick. Four
t e a m s t o o k part, C i v i l S e r v i c e , IC
Wageningen (from Holland) and the
Lemmings a team from South Kensing-
ton Museums.
The competition was organised on a
league basis with each team playing
three games. The first rounds saw the
Civil Service convincingly beat Wag-
e n i n g e n 20-4 while IC took on the
Lemmings, and laboured in getting on
top of this motley crew and at half-time
the score was still 0-0 despite great vocal
support from a merry band of sup-
porters. S e c o n d half points from a
Dunleavy penalty and Price-Stevens
try gave the crowd something to cheer
about, enthusiasts cheering after IC's
second try was soon muted, when it
was r e a l i s e d that G o r i n g w a s the
scorer, giving a final score of 11-0.
In the s e c o n d r o u n d the l u c k l e s s
Dutch were beaten 12-4 by the L e m -
m i n g s , a n d IC e n c o u n t e r e d t h e i r
hardest game aginst Civil Service. T h e
G o v e r n m e n t r e p r e s e n t a t i v e s w e r e
obviously taking things very seriously
and after several fracas during the first
half the referee saw it necessary to
send both teams off the field to lecture
the captains. O n the resumption, the
Civil Service potted three penalties to
come out 9-0 victors, may I add that
our b e h a v i o u r was e x e m p l o r y , a n d .
being civil servants our opponents hit
o u t in t r i p l i c a t e . ( R o b i n - R i n g e r -
Moorgate-Davies is innocent — maybe).
In the final round the Civil Service
were held to 4-0 by the Lemmings but
still took the tournament, and IC took
o n W a g e n i n g e n . It s o o n b e c a m e
apparent that no matter how we tried
it was going to be difficult to let our
Dutch friends score, so we went on to
give them a veritable drabbing of 34-0,
tries coming from Will Burgoyne (2),
Phil Ratcliffe (2), Pat Dunleavy and
S t e v e T o w n s e n d . T h i s g a m e w a s
played in a friendly spirit and every-
one who was there, is looking forward
to the I C R F C tour to Holland when
Wageningen will be our hosts.

IC were again to make changes to
their regular line up for S a t u r d a y ' s
g a m e a g a i n s t St T h o m a s ' . Q u e n t
Merritt continued in place of Graham
R i c k a r d with A n d y H a r t l a n d j o i n i n g
him in the forward line. For the absent
Dean the defence had been pruned of
both full backs so that Jim Beer was
brought in at left back. At right back
we had Dennis Cook, who must have
been inspired by Seb Coe's appear-
ance in the Hyde Park Relay, as he
s p e n t m o s t of the g a m e at s p e e d
approaching M A C H 2!
IC were just getting into their stride
w h e n St T h o m a s ' s were p r e s e n t e d
with a goal. However, IC fought back
well, so well that C h r i s H e n d y got
b o o k e d a n d e q u a l i s e d , just, f r o m
boofted and~equalisBd7~ju«tr~fTom
Stevenson's penalty. After Hendy was'
fouled. St Thomas's began to flag and
when Rowley's cannon ball shot was
dropped by the keeper, Hartland was
on hand to hit two shots at defenders
before Merritt arrived to finish the job
p r o p e r l y ! At 2-1, their heads were
- down and a superb goal at the start of
the s e c o n d half s e a l e d it. H a r t l a n d
made a superb run past three defenders
to the goal line and, as the keeper came
to him, he crossed so precisely that even
the horizontal Rowley couldn't miss!
Ten minutes from the end, Hendy was
i n v o l v e d in a c o l l i s i o n that led t o .
concussion, but soldiered on for all of
two minutes before* being led off not
knowing where he was! After this St
Thomas's revived but IC clung to their
guns to finish up 3-1 winners.
Hendy survived the dreaded St John's
a m b u l a n c e man a n d arrived in the
showers. He declined an offer to write
the match report, as he was suffering
from a m n e s i a ! H e f o u n d it hard to
believe he had been booked and refused
to believe Haralampous had got a hat
trickr
Chris was last seen in the capable .
hands of his nurse, Jill, who will no
d o u b t j o g h i s m e m o r y a b o u t t h e
important things in life!
Team: S Veats, D Cook, J Beer, M
Kenrick, K Reeve, C Hendy, A Hara-
l a m p o u s , I S t e v e n s o n , J R o w l e y , A
Hartland and Q Merritt.
IC t o o k the f i e l d a g a i n s t C h e l s e a
d e t e r m i n e d to w i p e out t h e i r two
previous dismal displays. This seemed a
likely event as Chelsea had got a single
point so far this season! IC's flagging
m o r a l e w a s f u r t h e r b o o s t e d w h e n
Chelsea's captain suggested playing for
the points from a previously postponed
fixture to make the match worth four
points.
The side showed two changes from
ithe regular side, Hendy being moved to
full back with third team star Mart
Armstrong taking his midfield place and
Quent Merritt deputising for superstar
Rickard.
The game itself memorable for being
forgettable! The result was 6-0. Only two
incidents stand out in the match. In the
first half the never dependable Reeve
produced such a perfectly weighted
back p a s s that the ball, a C h e l s e a
f o r w a r d a n d S t e v e V f f a t s r a r r i v e d
simultaneously at the edge of the box!
The result was Veats going for the ball,
the forward getting Veats in the rib cage
(nothing like Chris Hendy's cage!) and
the ball shooting off vaguely goalwards.
Kenrick cleaned up the ball while Reeve
tried to clear up the pile of arms and legs
that once passed for IC's goalkeeper!
Fortunately Veats was able to continue,
thus saving ICfrom having their'reserve'
goalkeeper, Reeve, in goal again!
The second incident began in the
second half when Haralampous took a
throw-in to Dean, who controlled and
turned beautifully. O n looking up he
saw a red streak burning down the
centre of the pitch and couldn't help
himself from hitting the ball towards it.
The ball richoceted off the 'object' for a
very g o o d g o a l . Just as Dave was
claiming it, we noticed a multitude of
noise and arm waving from the now
decelerating flash and realised that it
was, in fact, 'kinky' Kenrick, who had
a c t u a l l y a c h i e v e d his s e a s o n l o n g
ambition to score . . . a goal! This was
goal six, the other five coming from
Stevenson, Rowley, and Dean.
Team: S Veats, C Hendy, M Curran, M
K e n r i c k , K Reeve, M A r m s t r o n g , A
Haralampous, I Stevenson, J Rowley, D
Dean, Q Merritt.
