FELIX Editor
C A N D I D A T E : Lars Wernberg-
PROPOSER: Jon Firth Mollcr
I a m proposing Lars because overall he is
the only candidate capable of doing the
job successfully. T h e Editor is responsible
for the production and printing of F E L I X .
O n l y Lars has w o r k e d on F E L I X throughout
the year; he fully understands each stage of
the production and c a n w o r k to a tight
schedule.
The Editor must keep people interested and
involved and must organise the day-to-day
running of the print unit; Lars has beer
chairman of the F E L I X committee and I C L
P u b l i c i t y O f f i c e r a s w e l l as b e i n g on
Publications B o a r d and I a m sure will do this
extremely well. Sitting on I C U C o u n c i l thi-
year has given him a good view of the Union
I'm sure you'll agree that Lars is the best
man for the job.
Jon Firth
Every editor has his o w n style; mine involves
s o m e c h a n g e s , firstly in the e d i t i n g of
articles to include only those items which
are interesting a n d informative, allotting
space to each on its merits. C o p y deadlines
will be reintroduced, with enough leeway to
encourage people to write for F E L I X , but
set early enough for the editor to do the best
possible job. That way every copy of F E L I X
can be folded and collated on Thursday
evening.
Secondly, I'll introduce the variety to F E L I X
to make it a newspaper you'll want to read
from beginning to end. That includes a
concise, relevant and regular editorial which
I firmly believe is essential to the paper.
If you want printing work done by the U n i o n
print unit, you will k n o w exactly what is
available and get reasonable deadlines — if
you're not satisfied, it won't be for lack of
trying. T h e future of F E L I X depends on the
election of a responsible, imaginative and
efficient editor and that is what I shall be.

I claim that I can make F E L I X lively —

I have proved my stamina for the arduous
aspects of editorship by working for one
thousand hours to produce the Drake's

but t e c h n i c a l l y m u c h m o r e difficult to
produce.

no one . . . why one man with a typewriter

F E L I X with all its phototypesetter and

CANDIDATE: Steve Marshall
PROPOSER: Mark Smith
Steve, as many of you will already k n o w ,
has gained a great deal of experience in
publications while at College. H e joined
F E L I X on his very first day three years
aqo and contributed cartoons regularly
throughout his first year, during which he
b e g a n t o g a i n k n o w l e d g e o f a l l t h e
equipment in the office. A t the end of this
year he produced a cartoon book.
A s a second year he still contributed to
F E L I X and also took on the editorship of
the Rag Mag and the RCS Handbook. H e
s p e n t t h e m a j o r i t y of t h e s u m m e r
vacation preparing these publications and
also advised Spanner and contributed to
the 7 C U Handbook.
Undoubtably his greatest achievement is
the resurrection of The Phoenix to its
f o r m e r g l o r y . T h i s is the m a g a z i n e of
Imperial College U n i o n , founded in 1886
by H G Wells, which was in danger of
extinction until he intervened. Y o u can
judge the r e s u l t s for y o u r s e l f , but as
someone w h o has been actively involved
in publications, I must say that this is
c e r t a i n l y the m o s t p r o f e s s i o n a l a n d
attractive one I have seen.
S t e v e is w i l l i n g to be j u d g e d o n his
achievements and can be relied upon to
p r o d u c e an o u t s t a n d i n g F E L I X . N e v e r
before has there been such an experienced
candidate for the post.

F E L I X needs rejuvenating and I believe that
I have the necessary knowledge to put it
onto the right path.
Under my editorship:
(a) M o r e College news would b e
included.
(b) A L L sports results would be published.
(3) A series of research articles both in and
out of College would be started — 'sensitive'
areas would not be ignored.
(d) Active, sometimes controversial, letters
page.
(e) Less typographical errors.
(f) M o r e attractive layout and design.
(g) C a r t o o n s , a weekly prize crossword and
occasional humorous articles would be
included.
