N E W S IN BRIEF
KIDS TOUR L O N D O N
O n Friday 29th February, Imperial
College played host to a group ofj
thirty school children and teachers
from Laird Street Primary School
which is in a d o c k l a n d area of
Birkenhead on Merseyside. T h e
plight of these c h i l d r e h , being
b r o u g h t u p in a b a c k of h i g h
u n e m p l o y m e n t a n d c o n d i t i o n s
resembling those of the depression
were featured in an article in the
Sunday Times on 1st March.
Their day trip to London, or
ganised by IC Community Action!
Group was an enjoyable affair for al'
invovled. Seven volunteers, some!
would say with masochistic tenden-
cies, went to meet the kids at Euston
Station. Everyone was then loaded
on to a coach which was hired for the
day to tour the sights. The coach
driver, Sam, was an immediate hit
with the children greeting them with
"Kids, I don't mind, it's the students,
I'm worried a b o u t " . T h o s e vol-
u n t e e r s f r o m the S o u t h s o o n
mastered the Merseyside accent ano
the c o a c h set off on a magical
mystery tour of London, with San
the driver pouring forth his know
ledge of L o n d o n over the loud
speakers, to a response of loud
praises of Liverpool Football Club.
A call was made to the Old Curiosity
S h o p , s o m e t h i n g it was never
designed for. The proprietor thrust
wads of postcards in the children's'
hands in an effort to get rid of
them.
The kids were then taken on a
b o a t t r i p o n the T h a m e s a n d
t h o u g h they enjoyed this, they
were bitterly disappointed not to
spot any sharks.
The first match was played last Wednesday in the Sparkes Cup
between Guilds and RCS. Guilds won 17-7.
The sights soon exhausted, even
S a m ' s birthplace, the T o w e r of
London (true!), the kids were then
taken round the Science Museum.
Each volunteer was assigned four
c h i l d r e n , w h i c h in most c a s e s
proved too many. One volunteer
returned with only two, the remain-
ing two being found, after about
fifteen minutes panic, hiding in an
old London train.
T o end the day a tea party was
provided in the I C W A Lounge and
after a dash back to Euston they
were waved goodbye, by a small
group of formerly innocent young
IC students who were by then just
shells of their former selves.
A s for the kids, they thoroughly
e n j o y e d t h e m s e l v e s a n d they
cordially invite us up to Birkenhead.
Any takers? No? I thought not.
THE GREAT IMPERIAL RAG RACE.
At 2.00pm last Friday, the Bot/Zoo
tea room witnessed the start of the
Great I.C. Rag race. Encouraged by
promises of fame fortune and cases
of Swan, about twenty people set off
by various methods, all hoping to sell
the most, go furthest or travel by the
w e i r d e s t m e t h o d p o s s i b l e .
Having found a likely looking partner
in the form of Steve Hutchings, the
first task was to get to Staples Corner
to try to hitch a lift North. Weighed
down by Rucksacks, Rag-Mags and
bottles of Scotch, we arrived at the
M l at 3.30, after losing our way
between it and Brent C r o s s
Underground Station (Good start!).
Two lifts and a Watford G a p coffee
later we arrived in Sheffield.
Somehow Steve has 301bs more in his
rucksack than I have, although we
can't find it. Once at the University,
the Raq Maqs sold fairly well, helped
along by a friendly Rag committee.
S a t u r d a y 1.00am found us
wandering around Sheffield looking
for the station (lost againhThe
o v e r n i g h t t r a i n t o o k us to
Dundee.Dawn over the Firth.of
Forth saw us struggle awake to face a
breakfast of B R . coffee.crisps and a
liberal measure of Scotch. 9.00am
saw us arrive in Dundee to find
almost everybody sleeping off a
monster party. Undeterred we
pressed on, finally to be invited for a
cup of tea oy an attractive young
lady. Encouraged by this, every
sleeping person in her hall was
offered a chance to buy an I.C. Rag-
Mag.Having roused the whole Hall,
we d e p a r t e d for N e w c a s t l e .
Breakfast
5:50pm and we were lost again.
After passing a purple Town Hall
we finally arrived at Newcastle
University. Their own Rag Mag was
banned from being sold in the
Union but that didn't stop us from
selling our one. A friendly reception
and a great evening, disturbed only
by a minor panic where we thought
our rucksacks had been locked
away overnight in a cloakroom.
10:45pm, and we departed from
Newcastle bound for Leicester.
S u n d a y 1:10am, three miles
gone, hundreds to go. Hitching at
one o'clock on a Sunday morning
is definitely not r e c o m m e n d e d .
Hitching was abandoned and we
walked back to the city centre in
search of a coach. 3:00am, we
were freezing and the coach still
didn't depart for a n o t h e r four
hours. T h e bus station was shut up
so there was nothing else to do but
sleep on the pavement, becoming
hypothermic in the process, the
waiting room opened at 5:00am
giving us a chance to start thawing
out. N o coaches to Leicester so we
decided to get a coach home.
10:25am Woohall services some-
where near Sheffield again. Our
first hot meal since T h u r s d a y .
More fitful sleep on the coach and
last we were back in L o n d o n .
Sunday night in the bar sees the
return of other intrepid travellers
e a c h with t h e i r o w n tales of
universities c o n q u e r e d a n d Rag
Mags sold.
