I a m a third year Physics undergraduate
w i t h a h i s t o r y of U n i o n a c t i v i t y : R a g
stunts in my first year, then a society
c h a i r m a n s h i p , a n d n o w R e c r e a t i o n a l
C l u b s Committee C h a i r m a n with respon-
s i b i l i t y tor o v e r t h i r t y c l u o s , a r o u n d
£23,000 turnover, and a place on C o u n c i l
— good experience for a D P .
I a m standing because having contributed
a lot to the U n i o n and gained an under-
standing of its problems it would be a
waste if I were not elected.
1 would like to implement the following
policies.
The B o o k s h i p should be run as a service,
so that y o u do not pay high prices. It
should stock the b o o k s y o u need which
c o u l d be d o n e by d e p a r t m e n t a l r e p s
holding a survey to find which ones are
useful.
T h e U n i o n should run a shop stocking
c l o t h e s , s p o r t s g o o d s , e t c . A n i n t e r -
u n i v e r s i t y b u y e r s ' c o n s o r t i u m e x i s t s
w h i c h e n a b l e s us t o p u r c h a s e f r o m
manufacturers cheaply.
W e will be changing to per capita funding
for next year, providing extra money. I
would ensure that our capitation fee is
large enough to take advantage of this
change.

which currently are a shameful drain on
our resources. T h e answer is to have a
U n i o n transport service, with a committee
and the ability to do what is needed.
T h e safety of w o m e n , w h e n t h e r e a r e
u n w a n t e d , u n i n v i t e d p e o p l e a r o u n d is
desperately important a n d I would d o all I
could to prevent any nasty incidents.

T h e Deputy President's job involves all
the services affecting students. Besides
the hard grind of sitting on or chairing
endless committees, the D P must represent
o u r v i e w s to C o l l e g e p e r s o n n e l a n d
persuade them to improve their services to
us. T h e D P must be able to organise this
job meticulously and above all be able to
get on well with people.
Rae, as V P of R C S U last year, and now
as R a g C h a i r m a n has gained vast adminis-
trative and organisational experience at
both C C U and I C U level. She is well-
k n o w n , a p p r o a c h a b l e a n d h a s m a d e
s u c c e s s f u l e f f o r t s t o g e t m a x i m u m

h e r s e l f a n d n o t b e c o m i n g a r e m o t e
bureaucrat.
S h e h a s a l r e a d y b e e n a d e p u t y t o a
President, with experience in officiating at
committees and U n i o n meetings. She is
organised and reliable and has been a
success. W e need a good D P and Rae
wants the job — she has earned your
vote.

C o n t r a r y to popular belief, the D P ' s job
isn't just hanging a r o u n d bars waiting to
see if a fight starts — its a diverse a n d
time-consuming job, with responsibilities
r a n g i n g f r o m o v e r s e e i n g f i n a n c e t o
choosing carpets!
I have researched and formed m y o w n
o p i n i o n s o n L o n d o n S t u d e n t T r a v e l ,
improving the Southside S h o p , possible
discount services, security, C o l l e g e / U n i o n
communications, finance a n d the host of
other areas of the D P ' s work. These will
be outlined in other publicity, but I must
stress that its your U n i o n , a n d your views
that matter — I'd like to hear what y o u
think on these issues, both now a n d in
the future.
In short, I a m prepared to do everything I
c a n t o s e e t h i s U n i o n r u n f o r t h e
m a x i m u m benefit of its students. I have
proved myself capable and efficient in m y
p r e v i o u s j o b s — p l e a s e g i v e m e t h e
chance to prove the same in this one.
