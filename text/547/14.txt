Hyde Park Relay
The thirty-second edition of the

One hundred and two teams finished the
race out of the original entry of one

The novelty of this year's relay was the
number of ladies running: twenty-six
ladies took part and it is hoped that next
year a ladies' event will be introduced on
a team basis.

slower than the record.
The Steve Webb Trophy for the
second placed team was won by
WLIHE 'A'.
The Imperial College Union Cup for
the fastest team from a college with
under five hundred male students was
won by St Mary's College for the
second year running.

SAILING CLUB
Last Saturday IC sailed a home
match against Cambridge in very light
and variable conditions, which made
for some very close racing.
In the first race IC rounded the first
mark second, fourth and fifth, but a
mix up over the course resulted in
Cambridge taking first, second and
fifth at the line. In race two, IC started
well and held on to finish first, second
and sixth.
The third and deciding race proved
to be the closest. On the penultimate
leg of the course the positions were
s e c o n d , fourth and fifth, with IC
needing second, third and fourth to
win.
Cambridge made the mistake of
crossing the line in first position,
leaving a three against two situation
on the final approach to the finish.
Close covering resulted in the two
remaining Cambridge boats being
dropped to fifth and sixth, and so IC
won the race and the match.
Team: John Williams (Captain), Gil'
Butler, Nick Ajderian, Kevin Andrews,
Colin Murray, Caolan Patterson.
