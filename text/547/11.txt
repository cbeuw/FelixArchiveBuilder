RAG CABER TOSSING
If you read the Kensington News And
Post last Friday, you may have seen a letter
from the National Deaf Children's Society,
which said, " W e have been very thrilled by
the e n t h u s i a s m a n d h a r d w o r k of t h e
students at Imperial College, in their efforts
to help deaf children."
The rest of the letter went o n to ask for
sponsorship for the children taking part in
our C A B E R T O S S I N G C O N T E S T , which
t a k e s p l a c e t o m o r r o w , S a t u r d a y 8 t h
M a r c h in Prince's G a r d e n s .
If you've been one of the ones contrib-
uting the "enthusiasm and hard w o r k "
m e n t i o n e d , t h e n I a s s u r e y o u f r o m
experience, that it makes it all worthwhile
w h e n ' y o u m e e t the c h i l d r e n y o u a r e
helping. If you haven't been involved in
Rag yet, then I urge you to c o m e along
a n d really see w h a t we are d o i n g —
tomorrow we are having about fifty deaf
children from schools which we will be
buying equipment for, plus their parents,
teachers and officers of the National Deaf
Children's Society, if you want to ask any
questions 'about deafness, the equipment
we're buying, etc.
This event is designed to be a great day
out for the kids, and for Y O U to get
i n v o l v e d . T h e r e ' s l o t s o f h i g h l a n d
demonstrations, games, fun, jelly and ice-
cream, and the national press should be
there too. S o please c o m e along — either
to the event itself at 2:00pm or if you
w a n t t o h e l p we'll be a r o u n d P r i n c e ' s
Gardens/Southside L o w e r Dining R o o m
from 10:00am. B E T H E R E — it'll be great
fun and give you immense satisfaction if
you've done anything for R a g this year.

P G TIPS
Of the various matters discussed at
meeting of the Graduate Committee on
3rd March, I should like to bring the
f o l l o w i n g to the a t t e n t i o n of P G
students.
OVERSEAS RESEARCH STUD-
ENTS FEES SUPPORT SCHEME
T h i s is a s c h e m e that w o u l d be
a p p l i c a b l e o n l y f r o m t h e c o m i n g
academic year and has been set up by
the Secretary of State for Education
a n d S c i e n c e to p r o v i d e awards for
partial remission of tuition fees (to the
e x t e n t of t h e d i f f e r e n c e b e t w e e n
overseas and home students' fees) to
overseas research students of " o u t -
standing merit and research potential".
T h e r e will be a total of a b o u t five
hundred such awards of which IC is
expected to get a share of about sixty.
At p r e s e n t t h e r a t e of i n t a k e of
o v e r s e a s r e s e a r c h students at IC is
about one hundred and twenty per year
on average. Since this trend is likely to
decline over time, it would seem that
more than half the overseas research
students joining IC In 1980-81 would
be a b l e to t a k e a d v a n t a g e of this
scheme. The awards would initially be
made for a . p e r i o d of one academic
year, but are extenible for the full
course of study of the student.
SUPERVISION OF RESEARCH
STUDENTS
T h e committee also discussed some
q u e s t i o n s r e l a t i n g to p r o t r a c t e d
periods of research in the case of P h D
students.
It was generally agreed that while
three to four years was the 'normal'
time to finish a PhD, if students were
t a k i n g m o r e t i m e t h e n t h e r e wer^e
r e a s o n s t o l o o k d e e p e r i n t o t h i s
p h e n o m e n o n . T h e R e g i s t r a r h a s
a g r e e d to c o l l e c t s o m e information
relating to P h D students who have
been registered as full-time students
for more than four years.
O n e often hears complaints about
research students not getting adequate
s u p e r v i s i o n either b e c a u s e of s o m e
personal problems with their super-
visors or because the supervisor has
far too many students to supervise or
because some supervisors take up so
much consultancy work that they have
virtually no time left for their research
students. In this connection, Richard
E a r l , my p r e d e c e s s o r , h a d tried to
conduct a survey which among other
things, asked the P G s whether they
thought they were getting adequate
s u p e r v i s i o n . U n f o r t u n a t e l y , the re-
sponse rate of this survey was so low
that the o n l y t h i n g that c a m e out
unequivocally was the general apathy
of the P G s to such efforts.
H o w e v e r , e v e n if t h i s p r o b l e m
affects only a very small proportion of
research students, it still needs to be
Jooked into i n
detail. The Chairman of
Ithe Graduate Studies Committee has
kindly agreed to write a letter to heads
of d e p a r t m e n t s to find out a b o u t
research students in their departments
who are taking more than four years
for their PhD and also to find out the
possibility of alloting an a d d i t i o n a l
staff advisor/alternate supervisor or
having a P G tutor/an advisory body in
each department to whom the research
s t u d e n t s c o u l d go a n d talk a b o u t
problems of supervision. Some depart-
ments already have such a provision. In
any case, I think this is a positive step
and must be commended. If you have
any other ideas that could help, come
and see me or drop a line and I will come
and see you.
NEW MSc COURSE IN NUCLEAR
FUEL TECHNOLOGY
T h e department of C h e m i c a l E n -
g i n e e r i n g is g o i n g to run this P G
c o u r s e f r o m O c t o b e r 1980. It is a
substitute for an earlier course and
has been approved by the Graduate
Studies Committee. It would be put
before the Engineering Board on 5th
March and in all probability would be
given a go ahead.
The reason why I bring this to your
notice is because after having looked
at the p r o p o s e d s y l l a b u s of t h e
c o u r s e , I, p e r s o n a l l y , think that the
s a f e t y a n d e n v i r o n m e n t a l i m p a c t
a s p e c t s of n u c l e a r fuel t e c h n o l o g y
have not got sufficient attention. At
present less than about ten percent of
the lectures seem to be devoted to
these aspects.
M o s t of the g r a d u a t e s f r o m t h i s
course, according to the notes before
the G r a d u a t e S t u d i e s C o m m i t t e e ,
would be employed by British Nuclear
Fuels Ltd (BNFL) and other nuclear
power companies like N P C , G E C , etc.
The B N F L also hope to send some of
their staff members for this course.
This course at IC must give a balanced
picture of the hazardous aspects of
n u c l e a r e n e r g y — particularly when
institutions like the B N F L do not have
a clean record of matters relating to
safety (see for example, (i) Science for
People, page five, Autumn 1978, and
(ii) Counter Information Service Anti-
Report Number 22, pages twenty-one
to twenty-nine).
While individuals should perhaps be
free to c h o o s e w h e t h e r they want
nuclear energy or not, students such
as t h o s e who w o u l d graduate from
this course must have a fair picture of
all aspects of nuclear energy. Their
responsibility becomes all the more
crucial considering that people who
a r e m o s t s u s c e p t i b l e to n u c l e a r
hazards are those who are also the
m o s t v u l n e r a b l e s e c t i o n s of the
population and have had no direct sav
in c h o o s i n g nuclear energy, ie the
common man/woman and more impor-
t a n t l y , the i n d u s t r i a l w o r k e r s in
nuclear plants.
Lastly, those of you who would like
any Union help in solving any of your
specific problems are welcome to get
in touch with me.
