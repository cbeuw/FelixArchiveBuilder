Edinburgh's A w a r d Scheme in a country
other than the U K ? Y o u are? T h e n read o n .
T h e D u k e of Edinburgh's A w a r d S c h e m e
is a programme of spare-time activities
available to young people between the ages
of fourteen a n d twenty-five, designed to
encourage a spirit of voluntary service, self-
reliance a n d perserverance, a sense of
responsibility to the eommunity a n d the
acquisition of vocational skills.
T h e A w a r d S c h e m e is operated under a
variety of titles in over forty countries
throughout the world, mainly the C o m -
monwealth, where it has been successfully
adapted to meet the needs of young people
from many different environments, cultures
and backgrounds.
T h e A w a r d Scheme 'relies upon adult
help for its implementation and promotion
— adults who are not necessarily connected
with schools or youth organisations, but
w h o are concerned about the development
of young people into mature and respon-
sible citizens.
