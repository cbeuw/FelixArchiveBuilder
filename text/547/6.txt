H E A T H A T IMPERIAL
Tuesday saw the return of a packed
Lecture Theatre, with Edward Heath
speaking to an audience of about three
hundred and fifty in Physics Lecture
Theatre One. This was a great follow up
to the Finniston lecture on the day
before. Mr Heath is a Conservative ex-
Prime Minister, and is at present M P for'
Bexley and Sidcup. Mr Heath spoke at
great length on the future economic
policy of the world, and directly tied up
the problems facing Third World developing
countries and the developed countries.
The audience was first informed of the
past global economic policy which led to
thirty yuears of prosperity following the
Sedond World War. The policy of the U S
lending money to European countries so
that these countries could rebuild their
industries, knowing that Europe would have
to use U S i n d u s t r i e s and t e c h n i c a l
knowledge if technology was to return to
Europe.
The future of Britain relies on us helping
to extend this principle in the next twenty
years. However, the role that we must play
has changed. Europe has to rely on O P E C
countries investing their oil profits in other
Third World countries. Investment in these
countries would result in a demand for
technical expertise from countries in the
North (ie, America, Canada, Australasia,
and European countries). This would help
to ease the problems of unemployment
which we presently face.
We can no longer rely on our traditional
industries, eg, motor industry to support
our economy. Instead we must fully develop
new industries and new technology, eg, the
silicon chip industry. Thus we cannot
remain stationary in terms of technological
advance, but must be constantly breaking
new technological barriers. However this
relies on developed countries being able to
come to some agreement with O P E C
countries as to the future of oil supplies and
oil prices, as without this agreement future
investment will be difficult if not impossible.
After his s p e e c h , M r H e a t h then
answered questions from the floor. Most of
the questions were on the subject of
overseas development. The first was raised
o n the p o s i t i o n a n d status of Iron
Curtain countries in this global strategy.
T h e principle of industrial cooperation
without political guarantees was accepted
whilst noting that we have alot to answer for
in this held. We must no longer consider the
situation as being one of 'aid', but as one of
• 'mutual cooperation'. In conclusion most
people came away feeling that they had
learnt a great deal on future global policy,
from a man who must be recognised as an
expert in this field.
