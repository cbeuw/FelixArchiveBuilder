AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL
NEW DIRECTIONS?
A number of IC students recently
entered the world of economics, or at
least the London school of such to
a t t e n d a m e e t i n g o r g a n i s e d b y
Amnesty International. The meeting's
purpose was to inform us of the latest
developments in Al's campaigns, and
to give notice of short talks by people
from A l , followed by discussion groups
on various topics.
A speaker from the International
s e c r e t a r i a t of A l t a l k e d a b o u t the
changing nature of Amnesty's cam-
paigning, whereby it is now interested
in the large scale a b u s e of h u m a n
rights by a c o u n t r y , as well as the
detention of a given individual. This
change was brought about because in
s o m e c o u n t r i e s ( E t h o p i a , A m i n ' s
Uganda) the adoption of a prisoner by
Al was regarded as a death sentence.
A n example of this new style is the
current campaign on Guatemala which
is f o c u s e d o n t h e l i n k s b e t w e e n
m u l t i n a t i o n a l c o m p a n i e s a n d t h e
government. For instance, it has been
n o t i c e d that t h e r e is a 'very h i g h
degree of correlation between a rise in
death/disappearance rate of the local
peasantry a n d the desire of Inter-
national Nickel to start mining in that
r e g i o n . A l s o for G u a t e m a l a n e m -
p l o y e e s of C o c a - C o l a , t h i n g s just
don't go better with Coke.
O n the U S S R it was e m p h a s i s e d
that Al has no policy on either the
Soviet occupation of Afghanistan or
the holding of the Olympics in Moscow.
However, it is still very concerned about
the continued regard for human rights
displayed by the Soviet government.
Future campaigns will include action
on Zaire, Pakistan, export of 'repressive'
technology, U S S R , death penalty . . .

DOUBLE TRIUMPH FOR
HAMSOC
L a s t w e e k e n d , m e m b e r s of IC
Amateur Radio Society took part in two
•international contests simultaneously,
a n d e x c e e d e d their e x p e c t a t i o n s in
both.
The V H F station, G 8 E Y C , was entered
in the Radio Society of Great Britain
V H F / U H G contest. Only the Thursday
before the event, the decision was taken
to enter the 'single operator' category of
this event, with David Hardy (Chemistry
1) in the 'hot seat'. V H F conditions were
excellent, and so David concentrated on
quality (or rather, distance), rather than
q u a n t i t y of c o n t a c t s . H i s furthest
contact was a new club record: five
hundred miles to the Austria-Switzer-
land border. With close to two hundred
contacts in the twenty-four hours, his
efforts should put the club into the top
few placings: quite an improvement on
last year's last place!
Meanwhile the H F stations, G 5 Y C ,
was taking part in the forty-eight hour
American Radio Relay League contest,
attempting to contact as many stations
as possible world-wide. Progress was
s l o w t h r o u g h o u t S a t u r d a y , a n d it
seemed as though the final score would
only equal last year's 1,222 contacts.
However, several 'rare' countries were
c o n t a c t e d , i n c l u d i n g a few society
'firsts'. These included several remote
t r o p i c a l i s l a n d s , s o m e of w h i c h
members of Hamsoc had never heard ofI
Eight hours from the e n d of the
contest, Greg Kaye (Elec Eng 2) took
over as operator, and a m a s s e d an
a m a z i n g 1,017 contacts. T h i s final
marathon sprint was spectacular and
exciting to watch, with Greg contacting
four or more stations per minute at
t i m e s . T h i s s u d d e n l y e l e v a t e d the
society's hopes from being an 'also
ran', to that of a top placing. The final
result depends on how the opposition
fared, which will not be known for some
months yet.
The final total was 1,831 contacts,
made up as follows:
Greg Kaye (G4DKA) — 1,017 contacts
R u s s e l l Whitworth ( G 4 G Q A ) — 477
contacts
J a n C h m i e l e w s k i ( G 4 G Q A ) — 134
contacts
John Savage (G8RRD) — 82 contacts
Peter Mead (G4DOA) — 81 contacts
Kevin Foster (G8TYO) — 40 contacts
Finally, credit must go to the team of
helpers (better known as Insomniacs
A n o n y m o u s ) , w h o g a v e up t h e i r
weekend to keep things running. Their
vital support role Included log keeping,
duplicate contact checking, on the spot
e q u i p m e n t repairs, a n d , of c o u r s e ,
m a k i n g the a l l - i m p o r t a n t g a l l o n s of
coffee!
