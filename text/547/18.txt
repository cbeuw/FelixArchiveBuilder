Hon. Sec.
W h y should you read this manifesto?
Quite simply the answer is that I'm the
best candidate for the job, and it's more
i n t e r e s t i n g t h a n t h e r e s t of F E L I X
anyway!
I'm t a l l , s l i m , h a n d s o m e , c o m e f r o m
Colchester and have spent the past four
years studying in the Physics department
at Imperial, where I have a distinguished
academic record. Although I've not been
seriously involved in the main stream of
U n i o n affairs before now I have taken an
active role in the running of a number of
s o c i e t i e s . I have h e l p e d start up the
Industrial Society and think it is important
to foster l i n k s b e t w e e n s t u d e n t s a n d
industry. A s H o n Sec I would try and
collaborate with the society to arrange
talks on important current affairs, such as
the Finniston report. Another society that
I have helped form is the Hang-Gliding
C l u b and would in the future encourage
the formation of clubs to cater for new
interests.
I t h i n k t h e U n i o n s h o u l d be m o r e
c o n c e r n e d w i t h i s s u e s t h a t c o n c e r n
ordinary students, such as refectories, the
B o o k s h o p , and accommodation. O v e r the
past year the effective inactivity of the
U n i o n in dealing with the problem of the
refectories has been quite noticeable. I
t h i n k t h a t the U n i o n s h o u l d be m o r e
p r e p a r e d t o d e a l w i t h t h o s e i s s u e s
effectively. T h e seeming preoccupation of
the U n i o n in passing motions unconnected
with College life, and absurd in general, is
one facet which should be curtailed if more
students are to be involved in U n i o n affairs.

L a s t y e a r I w a s e l e c t e d H o n o u r a r y
Secretary of R C S U and during the year
g a i n e d e n o r m o u s e x p e r i e n c e i n t h e
organisation of large scale events and in
the everyday affairs of the U n i o n .
This year I a m A c a d e m i c Affairs Officer
of R C S U and have succeeded in forming
and chairing a very active a n d worthwhile
committee. A s R C S A A O I sit on C o u n c i l
and have been elected to act as Y O U R
representative on:
Refectory Committee
Vacation Training C o m m i t t e e
IC Health Services C o m m i t t e e
I automatically sit on:
B o a r d of Studies
Educational Technology Committee
L y o n Playfair Library C o m m i t t e e
and each staff/student committee within
R C S .
N e x t year issues such as the educational
cuts and refectories must be pursued and
I intend to back these up with prompt
and informative publicity. U G M s must be
b r o u g h t to the s t u d e n t s ' a t t e n t i o n by
means of E x e c N e w s which I hope will
urge more people to participate in Union
affairs. Easter 1981 is the date set for the
I N C O S T conference to be hosted by IC
U n i o n . This will require a large amount of
work, but I a m prepared to put in the
tim e n e e d e d to m a k e this p r e s t i g i o u s
event for the College a success.
F o r a k n o w l e d g a b l e , e n t h u s i a s t i c a n d
experienced H o n Sec you have only one
choice.
Vote Liz.

The job of H o n Sec of I C U is essentially
apolitical in that the main function of its
holder is to ensure that the administration
of t h e U n i o n w o r k s as s m o o t h l y as
possible; the same function, writ large,
that a chairman of a major sub-committee
performs. Having chaired the Social C l u b
p e r f o r m s . H a v i n g c h a i r e d t h e S o c i a l
C l u b s committee ( S C C ) for the past two
years with some efficiency, I feel well able
to tackle the job of H o n Sec.
Naturally there is also a policy making
side to the job of H o n Sec; but he can do
n o m o r e t h a n f o l l o w U n i o n p o l i c y .
Therfore there can be no question of an
H o n See's view predominating against the
wishes of the U n i o n ; and I, as a democrat, if
elected would have no wish to do so.
O n the issues which certainly face the U n i o n
n e x t y e a r t h e r e a r e t h r e e of u t m o s t
importance which the H o n Sec must deal
with. Firstly U n i o n finance will go through a
difficult phase needing sensible handling to
ensure that the U n i o n is not adversely
a f f e c t e d ( m y t w o y e a r s o n f i n a n c e
committee give me considerable knowledge
of the problems involved). Secondly, the
Internal Services Committee, if accepted,
will require an efficient secretary during its
first year of operation to ensure that it
settles in as part of the Union structure as
smoothly as possible. Thirdly, responsibility
of the I N C O S T conference will ultimately
fall to the H o n Sec to ensure its success. I
h a v e b e e n c o n n e c t e d w i t h a l l t h e s e
problems since their initiation and therefore
feel I have the necessary knowledge to
p e r f o r m the d u t i e s r e q u i r e d to r e a c h
successful conclusions on these issues.
F i n a l l y , n o u n i o n c a n be e f f e c t i v e i n
r e p r e s e n t i n g its m e m b e r s if it has a n
inefficient secretary. Therefore for a cap-
able Union vote for me for H o n Sec.
