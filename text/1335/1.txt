Charles Clarke, Home secretary
has order the extradition of Babar
Ahmad. The 31 year old former
Imperial College computer techni-
cian is accused of running terrorist-
supporting websites and recruiting
new members for terrorist organisa-
tions in Chechnya and Afghanistan.
The US Department of State has
claimed that websites run by Mr
Ahmad urged Muslims to use “every
means at their disposal” to train for
jihad, or holy war.
The home office said it had “given
full consideration” to representa-
tions made on Mr Ahmad’s behalf.
Mr Ahmad, speaking from Woodhill
prison in Milton Keynes said: “This
decision should only come as a
surprise to those who thought that
there was still justice for Muslims in
Britain. I entrust my affairs to Allah
and His Words from the Quran”.
His family have said they will be
appealling the extradition at the

High Court.
On 17 May magistrates ruled
Ahmad should be extradited, but
the decision was only approved by
Charles Clarke, the Home Secretary,
on Tuesday 15 November. The extra-
dition order comes under new anti-
terror legislation, which came into
force in January 2004. The new
legislation is designed to speed up
extradition of terror suspects and
the laws do not require US prosecu-
tors to present a prima facie case.
Mr Ahmad supporters, including a
large contingent from Imperial, are
dismayed at the decision. Sameena
Misbahuddin, Union President said:
“Union Council set policy to sup-
port Babar having a fair trial in the
UK and it’s disappointing that after
our students’ efforts, which were Continued on page 2
most prominent last year, it hasn’t
prevented the Home Secretary’s
decision. Our policy still stands, so
he continues to be supported by the
Union.”
The Muslim Council of Britain
said, “If our government has any
evidence of wrongdoing on the part
of Babar Ahmad then he should be
charged in this country and put on
trial here”.
The Labour MP for Tooting, Sadiq
Khan, believes Mr Ahmad should
face trial in the UK: “The allegations
are that Babar Ahmad committed
these criminal offences whilst in
the UK, whilst a British citizen and
whilst in London - if that is the case,
the obvious question is why can’t
and why shouldn’t he be tried in the
UK?”

Lawyers acting for Mr Ahmad are
concerned that he could face the
death penalty if he is sent to the
US and then transferred to military
jurisdiction. At the extradition hear-
ing in May, Senior district judge,
Timothy Workman, said that the
risks of the death penalty were “neg-
ligible”.
Imperial College Union has been
campaigningforMrAhmad’srelease
since December 2004. On the day of
the extradition hearing, Colin Smith,
former Welfare Campaigns Officer
said, “The fight isn’t over until the
last protester lets go of the wheels
of the aeroplane that takes Babar
off to the US.”

On 15 November ULU (University
of London Union) council passed
a Motion of No Confidence in the
council chair, Luca Manfredi, as a
result of homophobic remarks.
As previously reported in Felix
(1333) Manfredi posted homopho-
bic messages on a UCL internet
message board. Comments he made
included, “I would take out a big gun
and shoot my gay son”.
Nicky Grant, (ULU Vice President
of Welfare and Student Affairs)
who proposed the motion made an
impassioned speech: “ULU believes
that every student has the right to
study in an environment free from
prejudice, no one should have to
study in fear. There is no justifica-
tion for threats of violence to other
individuals… The strength of feeling
expressed by students leads us to
resolve that we have no confidence
in the chair”.
Luca Manfredi admitted a great
deal of “stupidity” on his part and
said “if I could turn back time, I
would and stop myself saying what
I said.”
In a rather bizarre speech Jason
Peachy, ULU LGBT Officer, com-
pared Manfredi’s delayed expres-
sion of remorse to that of Hitler
in Mein Campf. He said that “if
my father had took these views I
wouldn’t be here now” . He implied
that the issue maybe of extra rel-
evance to council delegates as “at
least 25% of the people present are
gay”.
While no delegates condoned
Manfredi’s comments, some
thought that the Motion was inap-
