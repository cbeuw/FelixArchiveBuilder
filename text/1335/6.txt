I
arrived at the Dana Centre
five minutes before 7pm at
the front end of the building to
find that I had no seat booked.
“No problem, go through,” the
lady at the ticket desk said smiling,
so I descended down some stairs
to an area small enough to have an
involved debate between all the peo-
ple in the room, but large enough to
be comfortable. A bar behind me,
selling drinks and snacks, promoted
the idea of a more social, engaging
environment. People sat at round
tables where they could meet other
people and presumably, by the end
of the night, end up having enthusi-
astic discussions, maybe over some
wine and some ammo from the actu-
al panel of experts. The whole ambi-
ence of the room set off a funky, new-
age type feel with modern décor.
A large glass wall looking onto the
outside of the building with bits of
writing on it loomed just behind the
panel of speakers, and the interior
was painted a bright yellow to give it
a far from outdated aura.
The event, “Drugs and the brain:
pills to make you normal”, is part
of a series exploring the future of
brain research, sponsored by the
Wellcome Trust. Any layperson can
come, and the discussions would
undoubtedly attract not just peo-
ple who are already interested or
involved in the topics discussed, but
also students and people who want
to get a first-hand opinion of some-
one who is an expert in the field.
The discussions got off to a rather
subduedstartasthefirstexpert,Clare
Stanford, a Psychopharmacologist
from University of London was
introduced and began speaking
about her views on drugs and the
brain. She seemed to feel on the
whole quite positive about the future
of drugs in solving mental health
issues: if women can take “the pill”
all their lives, and be quite happy
about the various side effects it has,
then why not change your brain
chemistry with drugs if they allevi-
ate or help the symptoms of a men-
tal illness? The next speaker, Peter
Kinderman, Clinical Psychologist at
the University of Liverpool, spoke
lively about his belief that a more
hands-on psychological approach
involving working through possible
social factors causing the issue may
yield more lasting results in certain
situations where the diagnosis is not
completely physical, for example,
depression. The third speaker, Peter
Tyrer, Psychiatrist from Imperial
College London, seemed to be at a
halfway house between the two, and
spoke with a calm, contemplative
observation of his opinions on the
matter.
The evening’s audience was inter-
esting. A nurse who works with
the NHS questioned the cost-effec-
tiveness of cognitive behavioural
therapy, to which Peter Kinderman
replied that even if such therapies
were more time-consuming in the
beginning, compared to popping a
pill of Prozac, they could have long-
er-lasting effects and take away the
dependence on pills with all their
nasty side effects. He suggested that
perhaps it wouldn’t be so expensive
if there were more people trained
to do it, and thatt perhaps this was
an option for the government to
address.
There was also a bunch of shy
men who came as a group, appar-
ently encouraged by their friend (or
so he said) to come out and over-
come their shyness with a combina-
tion of drugs and cognitive therapy
(in other words, alcohol and the
fascinating content of the discus-
sion). Peter Tyrer commented on
the pharmaceutical industry’s tal-
ent for picking up on what may
come in more extreme forms, for
example, severe cases of social
anxiety disorder, and then turning
it into a lucrative business oppor-
tunity where dozens of people who
just happen to be quite shy can now
go out and buy ‘medication’ to cure
their ‘disorders’.
The evening ended up involving
some good discussion: there were
two people who confessed to suffer-
ing from depression and said that
medication had been a great help
to them despite its side effects. It
was brought up by Peter Kinderman
that 50% of people apparently say
that the side effects are just as bad
as the having the disorder itself.
However, mixed opinion seemed to
be present about the use of drugs if
they could help induce a ‘normal’, or
more comfortable state.
At the beginning of the night,
the audience was asked to vote on
whether drugs are beneficial to the
individual suffering from a disorder,
and also if they are beneficial to
society. Originally, most people said
‘agree a little bit’ on both questions,
with a second majority going with
‘agree’, and a third with ‘neither
agree nor disagree’. At the end of
the night, a second chance to vote
varied the statistics only slightly,
with the overall opinions being
maintained.
All in all, it was a well worthy
night. Anyone who wants a stim-
ulating evening and loves a good
debate, or is interested in the
topic, or simply wants an ‘alterna-
tive’ night out with friends, should
check out future events at the
Dana Centre. Places do need to be
booked, but if you can’t get a space,
there’s always the opportunity of
watching it live on their website,

Pills to make you normal?
Natalie Heng reviews the Dana Centre’s debate on drugs and the brain.
A
revolutionary
approach to science
education is being
trialled in West
Midlands schools,
prompted by the upsurge of
interest in ‘teaching the contro-
versy’ by some American educa-
tion board officials.
In October 2004 a decision was
made by US education board
officials in the Dover district of
Pennsylvania to provide more
balance to curriculum coverage
of the origins of life. Classroom
time formerly devoted to the the-
ory of evolution would have to be
shared with studies of Intelligent
Design – a rival explanation of
the origins of life, fast gaining
proponents within the scientific
community. The move has since
created waves within the more
forward-thinking science depart-
ments on this side of the Pond.
“Frankly, we were wonder-
ing why we’d never thought
of it ourselves,” says Gideon
Lightbody, Telford County
Council Secondary Schools sci-
ence coordinator. “They started
by teaching the controversy over
the theory of Evolution, but why
take any of the so-called ‘truths’
of science for granted, when
we can give our children more
rounded educations. ‘Teach The
Controversy’ – TTC – it’s our
new slogan.”
To this end, the slogan has
been assiduously applied to
Litchfield’s secondary schools’
science curricula. Evolution was
the obvious starting point, but
their new educational maxim
has been taken further by the
likes of Karen Roe, Deputy
Head-Teacher at Fairfield
Comprehensive:
“We now teach the controversy
over the outdated sun-centred
view of the solar system, and
we’re currently revising the
chemistry and first-aid curricula.
Alchemy, for the first time in
three centuries, has finally made
a return to the classroom.”
Ms Roe admits, however, that
putting the new system into
practice hasn’t been plain sail-
ing: “The lab sessions on cap-
turing Phlogiston didn’t go that
well, to be honest, and we had
complaints from parents when a
boy passed out after the school
nurse used bloodletting to treat
his ADHD.”
In spite of these difficulties,
and the recent decision in Dover
county to vote out many of
the Intelligent Design-friendly
school board members, Ms Roe
is bullish. “The State of Kansas
recently decided to redefine
science as not limited exclu-
sively to natural explanations.
We’ve taken one step back and
two steps forward.” As Gideon
Lightbody puts it, “If we crack
those duff ideas about gravity,
there’ll be no stopping us.”
