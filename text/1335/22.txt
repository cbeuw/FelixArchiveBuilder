Mirror Mirror
Lots of pretty pictures for you to
gawp at this week. We’ve been titting
about in Photoshop (always good
when ideas are in short supply) and
have cleverly disguised some ‘celeb-
rities’ via the magic of mirrors.
All you have to do is tell us who
they are, and in return we’ll give you
two juicy FUCWIT points. Seems
like a fair deal.
Emails, as always, to coffee.

Well done. There’s still time to
enter last weeks CB, and to put in
your bid for our lovely Gay Porn.
You know you want it.
