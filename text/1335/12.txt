gus shaped sceptres known as ‘ruyi’
carved from coral and rare wood
encrusted with jewels, both of which
are shown in this exhibition
One of the most astounding pieces
includes a metre tall jade boulder
that was transported 1000 miles
across China in the 18th century
before being carved into a model of
a holy mountain.
A lot of the artwork on show is
in the form of scrolls. Some scrolls
depict battle or hunting scenes
which show a multitude of tiny sol-
diers- trekking through hilly land-
scape, sailing down treacherous riv-
ers, or wrestling tigers, whilst others
like the ‘Emperor’s 60th birthday
celebration’ have a more relaxed
attitude. There is even a series of
scrolls which shows, as the audio
guide put so nicely, ‘rather seduc-
tive idealised women partaking in
leisure activities!’
If searching for criticism, the only
fault I could pick is that perhaps the
exhibition was too long, however
over all it was really interesting and
unique. Also, as many of the exhibits
have never left China before, this is
a unique opportunity to see artefacts
that are rarely available to the pub-
lic. I would definitely recommend it
to anyone even vaguely interested
in Chinese culture- after all how can
you go wrong with beautiful women,
fungus, and a small amount of moon
worship?

Culture, glory, and imperialism are
all integral to the Three Emperors
exhibition at the Royal Academy.
This exhibition, at London’s most
prestigioushomeofartsfromaround
the world, gives a unique insight into
the three most famous and powerful
emperors of the prosperous Qing
dynasty. The dynasty was the last
to rule China, and existed between
1644 and 1911.
The Chinese believed the emperor
to be the only direct link between
heaven and earth, and their pros-
perity was celebrated in the art of
the period. You can gauge the impor-
tance and power of these emperors
just by passing by the 5m portraits
and the huge ornate robes of gold
and dark blue. These arestartling-
ly intricate textiles and definitely
large enough to swamp any Chinese
emperor!
This exhibition is astonishingly
diverse, having everything from
10m long scrolls (some merely sec-
tions taken from 60m originals) to
olive shaped snuffboxes the size of
a fingernail. There are traditional
portraits and calligraphy as well as
strange ritualistic objects, for exam-
ple from the strong Chinese belief in
cosmology worshipping of the time.
The exhibition has costumes and
objects for moon worship includ-
ing ‘moon white’ glazed vessels of
curious symmetrical shapes each
believed to be part of the sacred
moon and an engulfing ‘moon white’
robe for the emperor to wear during
the ceremony.
These foreign rulers from Manchu
supported the Buddhist ideals of
Tibetans and Mongolians as well
as expressing an interest in sci-
ence and European culture. These
influences can be seen through
the hybrid style of painting which
depicts European influence on tradi-
tional Chinese styles, the European
style of perspective and highlighting
contrasting with the Chinese style
of flat planes and ornate surface
patterns.
Many of the pieces in the exhibi-
tion also feature some interesting
symbols that we still see around us
today, like the five clawed red drag-
on reflecting prosperity and protec-
tion, or the white rabbit which is
supposed to be lucky.
But there are also a few more
obscure images, like the fungus rep-
resenting immortality-the Chinese
do seem obsessed with their fungus!
Some of you might think that fungus
would be more in its place in the
mud outside, but the Chinese kept
huge screens with fungus made
out of wood, and had ornate fun-

The Royal Opera House is quite
possibly the last stronghold of
upper class snobbery left in the
public entertainment world today.
However, the new Travelex £10
Student Standby scheme is set to
change all that. The scheme works
by texting or emailing students with
details of available seats which can
then be booked online for just £10.
So, to celebrate this new and
wonderful student offer, Felix went
along to review the Royal Opera’s
current production of Tippett’s The
Midsummer Marriage.
The Midsummer Marriage is a
story of the spiritual development of
two couples, Jenifer and Mark, and
Bella and Jack. Set on a pagan back-
drop of ritual and seasonal celebra-
tion, the opera is full of undertones
of mythology and religion combining
to bring about Jenifer and Mark’s
spiritual reawakening, and the inevi-
table demise of Jenifer’s capitalistic

ROH opens its doors to students Love hurts: Cleansed
Cleansed is a very unsatisfying
play. With its major themes of humil-
iation and physical agony, seeing
Cleansed is a torturous experience
that I would recommend to few.
The play is composed of 20
extreme scenes, each either an epi-
sode of violence or some full-frontal
nudity. The language is minimal,
spoken as weighty poetry by a tal-
ented bunch of actors who supple-
ment it with stylistic and demanding
physical theatre. One memorable
scene, illustrating the artistic indul-
gence of Cleansed, was 10 minutes
of watching a man with a learning
disability, in great sobbing distress,
being forced to eat a whole box of
chocolates, one by one.
Kane, who committed suicide in
1999, was influenced by proponents
of the genre known as Theatre of
Cruelty. As Antonin Artaud extolled
back in the 1930s/40s, the aim of this
type of theatre is to shock its audi-

ence into such a state of terror that
they lose their capacity for rational
thought and are receptive to truths
that are usually suppressed.
The assaults Cleansed delivers
are not thematically progressive,
or arranged in order of severity: it
seems clear that Kane’s aim is sim-
ply to shock every viewer, whatever
their personal standards of offence.
I have seen plenty of horrible,
shocking content on stage before:
Euripides’ Medea murdering her
own sons; rape and mutilation in
Titus Andronicus; the abuse of asy-
lum-inmates in Marat/Sade; the list
goes on. But Kane failed to shock
me, because her play completely
lacks relevance to the real world.
In different scenes the characters
appear to be in different places – for
example a lunatic asylum, a pri-
vate mental hell, a strip club, on a
train-track; but the production style
renders these environments hope-
lessly vague. The play has an air of
flighty disregard towards concrete
practicalities, but what it fails to take
into account is that shock resides
on a background of specifics: famil-
iar situations being perverted in a
unthinkable manner, normal people
being driven to terrible things.

father King Fisher.
The impressively bizarre set rep-
resents a magical glade in a wood,
laid out like a games board and
enclosed by a wall. On the board sits
a globe or womb-like object from
which Mark’s spiritual advisors, the
Ancients, emerge to deliver advice.
The production lacks continuity in
the first act, but the fantastic danc-
ing of the second and the imagery of
the third bring it together to create
a real lasting impression. Flawlessly
performed, this is not one for new-
comers to the genre, but this is an
untraditional piece that pushes per-
ceptions of what opera should be.
