T
his week we have more
from me. Oi, I heard that
at the back! We are also
joined by the genius that
is Joe Mangle. Oops,
slight typo. Let’s hope Joe doesn’t
notice, otherwise I’m going to be
pressed flatter and wrung more
than his checked shirts! Badoom-
tish! Anyway, enough of the spiel.
Can I get a round of applause for
David & Co on Saturday! That game
was amazing! Shrek stole the show
in the first half. Then, the second half
was even more brilliant. England
battled and after Argentina took the
lead again you might have expected
us to quiver like a child after accept-
ing one of Michael Jackson’s lolli-
pops. Nope, we kept going and then
dear little Mikey, leapt twice and
headed us to victory. Excellent!
Before I start properly I’d just
like to inform you all: Rome saw a
20% decrease in audience figures
last week. This still equates to 4.7m
viewers, which is pretty epic for
BBC2, but soon my ranting will con-
quer Rome!
Now, Shakespeare Retold –
Much Ado About Nothing. Starring
Damian Lewis, the one from Band
of Brothers, and Billie Piper, the one
who liked tongue-twisters so much
she gave herself a new surname
dedicated to them, Much Ado was
a modern retelling set on a tel-

I felt a little daunted when the Felix
editor handed me the Punk: Attitude
DVD to review. My thoughts were: “I
hate punk music; he has given this
to the wrong guy.”
Punk: Attitude is a documenta-
ry chronicling the origins of punk
music, starting with bands such as
The Ramones and New York Dolls
and finishing with present day artists
such as Blink 182 and Limp Wristed,
sorry, Limp Bizkit. Thankfully, an
anarchy adoration and love of loud
noises is not a requirement to enjoy
this DVD. There are a multitude of
music clips for fans to mosh along
to, or whatever you crazy-cats do
these days but the documentary is
more concerned with the evolution
of punk ideologies and what bands
attempted to convey through their
music.
Punk music was conceived in the
early ‘70s but it wasn’t born and
named until Punk magazine was
created in 1976. Music from bands
such as New York Dolls was not
defined until the tabloids coined
the phrase “punk”, borrowing from
this magazines title. There was a
point behind this clamorous, abra-
sive noise that soiled, afro or mul-
let wearing weirdoes blared out
as they shouted down the micro-
phone. Artists challenged politics
and went against the system, or so
they argued. Listening to most past
masters being interviewed in Punk:
Attitude, their intentions sounded
entirely reasonable. However, one
interviewee comments that violence
was acceptable as long as their opin-
ions were getting heard. How can
this be taken seriously? For me,
this totally undermines what punk
musicians were striving for. It is no
evision news program. It followed
two couples as their relationships
went from one extreme to the other.
Piper played a ditsy weather girl
and Lewis was an comical, arrogant
news presenter. I thought he might
be in no-man’s land, but he was
very funny and suited the charac-
ter well. As the episode progressed,
it became more and more serious,
ending with Piper cracking her head
open. The doctors tried the best
they could, but unfortunately, there
was nothing they could do. Piper
was pronounced alive in order to
satisfy Shakespeare’s original. Well
worth watching the others in the
series, people.
Next up, Jonathan Goodwin in The
Seven Stupidest Things to Escape
From. Goodwin came up with situ-
ations of increasing hilarity that he
had to escape from. One memora-
ble example, that should have been
issued mind rubbers, saw a naked
Goodwin tied up in a lift. His family
waited at the bottom. He had eleven
floors to escape and get dressed.
He failed; and flailed! Blimey. Very
funny, but I’ve got one for you baldy!
How about: I lock you up naked in a
shed, set fire to it, seal your Peter in
a vice; tie you up except for one free
hand and finally place a meat cleav-
er within reach! Ha! That’s harsh...I
liked Goodwin. He was nice, placid
and I empathised when he broke his
leg coming off a zip line. An abso-
lute fruit-loop though. Mind you, his
father was pretty crazy too. Dad
calmly tied Goodwin up every time,
rarely showing an emotion before
unleashing a whole world of hurt on
his son.
Lastly, Lost. Not a great episode,
to be honest. Basically, Ethan was
lured into a trap. But, the plan went
wrong after Charlie shot him. It was
dramatic, but I felt annoyed. Yet
another chance to find out about
the mysterious island from Ethan
and the creators decide to kill him
off. It’s suspenseful, but it’s getting
pretty drawn out. 24, this is not.
Anyway, get those caps on, hoods
up, scarves wrapped. Till next time
brethren.

I
t’s all been going on since I got
back from the bush. My little
chook is courting some galah
from over the road. That kid’s
not so bad though. I made a
blue by saying he had never done
the naughty with a gal before, then
the drongo goes and shows my Sky a
list of ex-girlfriends. He may not be
the full quid, but if my Sky likes him
he’s alright by me.
And how about that mongrel Paul
Robinson. Some real monkey busi-
ness going on with him and Izzie. I
really wish she would rack off and
give the old doc some space to get
things on with Susan. You should
have seen the sight on his dial when
she came up with the whole ‘I was
raped’ thingo. Spewin’ like I’ve never
seen.
Bloody Sheilas, eh! That Janelle
Timmins is another one. Cunning
as a dunny rat. Really stirred things
up between me and Lynnie. She
claimed I pashed her at our Sky’s
eighteenth. Of course I had a gutful
of piss so I had to tell Lyn, but she
straightened things there and then.
With the blonde one over the
road gone troppo and Yellow-belly
Hazzer’s new found wowser salvo
attitude, I reckon everyone’s trip-
pin’. But nah! Here’ll do for me. Just
grab a tinny and veg out.
Hooroo till the next time!

Last weeks TV DVD Reviews
wonder I view these people as ruf-
fians, scallywags, rapscallions! It’s a
shame really. Many of the old band
members appear to be very intel-
ligent. Whilst their intentions were
understandable, their methods of
conveying their ideas were far too
extreme.
Ironically, unlike these punk mis-
creants, Punk: Attitude is very well
presented. Packaged in a sleeve
with the glossy image of someone
“flipping a bird”, it contains 2 DVDs
with plenty of extras and even rep-
licas of two Sniffin’ Glue fanzines.
It is definitely something that any
punk fan should have on their shelf
alongside their green hairspray,
metal studs and face chains. Punk:
Attitude is difficult to recommend to
anyone else other than middle-aged
men going through a mid-life crisis,
looking for inspiration on how to be
“hip” and “down with the kids”.
Overall, I must say, I was pleas-
antly surprised by the documentary.
Shockingly so, it pointed out that
even I have some punk attitude in
me, such as using computers to
burn CDs against record compa-
nies’ wishes. Yeah. Yeah! Fuck you
sonny! Ahem, excuse me. I don’t
know what came over me.
