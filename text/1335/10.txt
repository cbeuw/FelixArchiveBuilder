Rethink Rubbish: Reuse and Recycle
environment
Every 8 days, London produces enough rubbish to fill Canary Wharf. With worldwide car-
bon emissions soaring, it’s time for Imperial to rethink its Environmental Policy.

I apologise in advance for having to
say this, but there’s no other way.
Imperial College has turned out to
be a major disappointment. Coming
from a small college in the west of
Ireland, where progress on envi-
ronmental issues was slow, I had
great expectations that this college,
as such a major university in the
international scene, would be in a
completely different league. Sadly, it
did not take me long to realise that
things here are no better. Despite
its reputation as one of the foremost
colleges in engineering, medicine
and sciences, it fails miserably in its
most simple and domestic of duties;
its disposal of waste, and its depend-
ence on energy. Its hosting of an
Environmental MSc of international
renown and its support of numer-
ous initiatives focused on improv-
ing environmental standards in the
outside world, only serve to make
its own lack of regard to its environ-
mental duties all the more inexplica-
ble, if not ironic.
Walking around the campus, one
can’t help but notice the wastage.
Bins are full of plastic drink bottles,
aluminium cans and newspapers,
all good recycling material. Indeed,
it was calculated last year that 73%
of the current waste stream is recy-
clable, with a further 16% of material
being compostable. But very little
so far has actually been done.
At present, practically all of the
wasteistakenoff-sitebyWestminster
City Council and incinerated, at
South East London Combined Heat
and Power plant. Incineration has
its advantages over landfilling in
many aspects, including the recov-
ery of energy and the reduction of
volume of waste to 10%. However,
the South East London plant has
issues of its own. Recently, concerns
about air pollution and poor human
health have prompted the local
health authority (at Lewisham) to
carry out a health assessment study,
which is still due to be published.
Imperial have a duty of care under
the Environmental Protection Act
to give due consideration to where
their waste is going and if it is being
treated properly.
Some efforts have been made to
promote recycling but have not been
met with much success. An attempt
was made to initiate paper recycling
in administration offices around the
college has largely been unsuccess-
ful, due to poor participation rates
often because of the lack of recy-
cling points in appropriate locations.
Another scheme to recycle glass in
the Sherfield canteen again is only
a partial success due to a misun-
derstanding by staff of what was
required by them.
These highlight some of the dif-
ficulties of bringing in recycling
schemes. That even when the infra-
structure is in place, how do you
ensure that people will use them
properly? The answer is culture
change. And it is not as difficult as it
seems. The college provides excel-
lent training to all people starting
college on how to use the various
facilities from the library to sports
facilities. Therefore, it is not too
much more of a step to include
training on the practice of good
recycling habits at the beginning of
the year. This has to be supported
by the ubiquitous presence of recy-
cling stations with comprehensive
labelling of bins. Such a change was
brought into Norwich University
only a short time ago, and it has
been recently identified as a leader
in ground management programs.
The key to success was educating
students as soon as they entered the
college, and providing the facilities
for them to recycle. Once people
realise it is the norm, they will not
be long in participating.
The college also has to ask itself
why so much waste is created. Why
is it that every canteen on campus
only gives disposable drinking glass-
es and that plates in the union after
a certain time are all paper. It is not
just a case of logistics, as numerous
other institutions and colleges do
not have the same issue. It is to do
with policy. The absence of a clear
commitment from management
towards environmental sustainabil-
ity is providing the wrong signals
to every sector within the college,
including the catering sector, as well
as staff and students.
The other major area for concern
is energy use. Imperial recently
became subject to the carbon emis-
sion scheme which means it has
been granted a certain cap of energy
usage that emits carbon. This fig-
ure is due to diminish in the future
years in line with Kyoto Agreements
to reduce carbon emissions. If the
college does not decrease its carbon
emissions in line with these reduc-
tions, it will have to make up the
short fall by buying carbon credits
from institutions that have cred-
its to spare. At this early stage
of the scheme, there is no saying
how much these credits will cost;
they will be subject to normal mar-
ket forces. Thus the college may
well find itself having to spend large
amounts of money, money which
comes from students amongst other
places, as a penalty for not being
energy efficient. This could dam-
age its ability to pay and entice the
highest quality of staff for which the
college is known, and reduce the
service given to students in return
for their custom.
But here I will stop. I did not
intend this to be the habitual col-
lege-bashing, mud-slinging routine.
The college has been and continues
to be involved in numerous laudable
schemes dedicated to promoting
better environmental performance.
Last week the college launched
the Energy Futures Lab based at
Imperial which is to support major
research into future energy options,
which should be seen as a very posi-
tive development. A part of this is
will look into how much a city could
benefit if it were to optimise its use
of resources such as power, heat-
ing, transport and water. It gave
the example of “heating homes with
the heat from waste water.” This is
precisely the type of thinking and
attitude that is needed to face the
environmental challenges ahead of
us, and it is encouraging to see our
management being so supportive.
And the college, I’m sure, has it
within itself to go even further. By
looking inwards to its own practices,
Imperial can demonstrate the prac-
ticalities of its initiatives, by show-
casing them on its own campus,
restoring itself to position of one
of the world leaders in technology
matters.
The college needs to formulate a
clear environmental policy that will
dictate the strategy and approach
to be taken over the coming years.
Within this would be the commit-
ment to reduce waste production
and to establish recycling schemes
for key materials and thus reduc-
ing its dependence on landfill. This
would all be part of a college-wide
culture change brought in at the
start of the next academic year.
The college could follow its close
rivals at Oxford and Cambridge in
renegotiating its next energy con-
tract to reduce its use of fossil fuels
and obtain its energy from ‘green’
sources such as solar, wind and
hydro-electric. Though this may not
necessarily affect its carbon emis-
sions trading, it would send out the
right signals and provide some small
impetus for those industries.
And it can’t just all be down to
management. We all, as students,
have to a duty to communicate our
concerns to our own representa-
tives, through the Student Union,
and our various academic depart-
ments. Change can’t be always left
only on the square shoulders of our
Rector, nor on a bunch of ‘lefties’
in Esoc and the Environmental
Department. We all stand to benefit
from a change in our practices. If
there were to be at least change
in attitude towards environmental
practice in the short year I have
here, brought about by a serious
effort by students and staff to com-
municate the problem, this will have
been a major step forward. And you
never know, if that were to happen, I
might not even feel this college has
been such a disappointment.

day 21 November at 12.45pm in
Meeting Room 2 (union building)
there will be a chance to grill
Imperial’s current Energy Man-
ager about potential recycling
solutions on campus.

In addition, if you live in halls
and want to help recycling take
off there, please email the same
address and state which hall you
are in.
Kensington and Chelsea Council
provides a twice weekly kerbside
recycling service for all residents
who put their rubbish out in orange
bags. Orange Recycling Bags are
available from various outlets
including libraries and the town hall.
To encourage more recycling, the
bags have been reduced to easily
portable rolls of 25 bags at only £1.50
per roll. Alternatively, supermarket
carrier bags can be filled with recy-
clables and labelled by using an
orange “Bag Tag”. The Council pro-
vides these Bag Tags free of charge
at local libraries.

the one recycling basket or bag.
There are also 127 micro-recy-
cling centres conveniently located
throughout Westminster for use by
local residents.
