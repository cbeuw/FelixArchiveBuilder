Scorpio (Oct 23rd – Nov 21st)
You’ll find yourself
in a pickle this week
as you are jealously
coveting something of
your neighbours. Be-
ware of risking friend-
ships in the name of kleptomania.
Sagittarius (Nov 22nd – Dec 21st)
Your ego has taken a
battering recently so
it’s understandable
that you may be after
some TLC. Beware,
fishing for compli-
ments might reel in a shark.
Capricorn (Dec 22nd – Jan 19th)
Why oh why do these
things happen to you?
Don’t fret!! The fates
will ultimately smile
upon you, even though
they may be laughing
right now.
Aquarius (Jan 20th – Feb 18th)
Your humanitarian
impulses will come to
the aid of several peo-
ple this week. Rejoice
in the satisfaction this
gives you and reap in
the rewards.
Pisces (Feb 19th – Mar 20th)
Ok, so things aren’t
going as planned but
remember, everything
happens for a reason
and very soon you’ll
see why. Just be pa-
tient and all will be revealed.
Aries (Mar 21st - Apr 20th)
Emotions are in tur-
moil and threaten to
explode. Just remem-
ber too many cooks
spoil the broth. It’s
much better to leave
them to fight. Don’t worry; walk
away and relax!
Taurus (Apr 21st - May 21st)
Feeling glum are we? Its a pass-
ing phase, nothing to
worry about. Friends
make a great support
network. A stitch in
time, saves nine.
Gemini (May 22nd – Jun 21st)
Tension is rife this
week as you struggle
in your social relation-
ships. Don’t worry
though it’s not how
much you say it, it’s
what you say that counts!
Cancer (Jun 22nd – Jul 22nd)
You may bump into
someone from your
past towards the
end of you week. Be
warned as appearanc-
es can be deceiving!
Leo (Jul 23rd – Aug 22nd)
You’re the man about
town, keep it up!!
You may want to
slow things down on
Tuesday though. Stay
calm, and relax. Why
rock the boat!
Virgo (Aug 23rd – Sep 22nd)
Shit happens!! Deal
with it!! Pick yourself
up and keep going.
Worse things could
and have happened
before!! It’ll all blow
over soon, just keep smiling.
Libra (Sept 23rd - Oct 22nd)
It may seem as
though everything is
going wrong, but don’t
forget, every cloud has
a silver lining! Yours
is just beginning to
reveal itself! Hold on
just that little bit longer.
Man with a rant, what a surprise
Dear Miss C,
I’m a maths student, and
sometimes I feel that is all I have.
My girlfriend left me for a one eyed
shoe salesman, and recently I find
myself imagining I’m Neo from
the Matrix and I can see maths
formulas and pink elephants
everywhere. My room mate says
I’m crazy but he doesn’t know how
stupid he looks when he sleeps. I’ve
kept a log for over 5 hours a night
of all his facial expressions. I wish
to be the first to derive a formula
for this.
I was wondering if any of the
drizzle you claim is actual text,
worthy of aiding lost and morbid
angel souls like mine, could
possibly be applicable! Or maybe
I should turn to the expertise of
the fashion columnist and wear
make-up.
I am now able to save valuable
money on toilet paper and I feel
honoured to use your words of
wisdom for such essential acts of
life. In fact my intestinal flora, and
in fact certain fauna graces your
col[o](um)n.
I thank you for your solution, could
you please give me the working out
so that I may learn more!
Hail unto thee Captain Kirk,
I would of course give my name
but it is Nobody, and further more
to pronounce it properly I would
have to pull out your tounge and
nail it your big toe.
Dear Nobody,
Ummm…… Firstly I can’t believe
you even took the time to write
that e-mail. Secondly, though I
never thought it possible, I feel I
have to say that you are without a
doubt beyond my help, and I have
alerted the nearest insane asylum
to come take you way before you
cause yourself or anyone else any
harm. Thirdly, next time you’re
hunting for toilet paper, I hope this
page, specifically your letter comes
to mind as it is surely the most
deserving. Lets hope Scottie beams
you up soon!!
Wanted: An Apology!!
Dear Miss Confidentiality,
I have been friends with this girl
for a year and we are close. The
thing is I got stressed with her
about something. I got stressed
with her because of the amount of
homework I had to do and also the
bullying I faced at College. I don’t
want to lose her because of what
happened. What should I say to her
to make things right and to win her
friendship back?
Foot-In-Mouth
Dear Foot-In-Mouth,
Why is it that when a guy has a
problem they just bottle it up and
then take it out on some poor
unsuspecting female who just
happens to be in close range?
We never have to do anything,
you’ll just blow. Maybe it’s a time
to actually take a page out of the
girls’ handbook and learn to talk
about you feelings instead of just
exploding! We won’t assume you’re
gay if you have an emotional
moment! Now, as I feel a bit sorry
for you (which doesn’t happen
often!) I’ll help! I’m not going to
give you a list of magic phrases
guaranteed to bring any girl to her
knees, as one doesn’t exist: it’s a
pile of utter crap (I’ll save that rant
for another time though). What I
will say is, surprisingly, you need
to apologise. Yes, that’s right, get
down on those knees!! Talk to the
girl. Ranting at her without cause
is seriously not going to do you any
favours. If you guys are really close,
try confiding in her and tell her that
you’ve got stuff on your mind! We’re
girls, we have that problem daily,
trust me we’ll understand!
Moment on the lips...
Dear Miss C,
I feel awful today. I was getting
ready to go out for some girlie
shopping, and my ‘friend’ said,
“You needn’t wear that. You can’t
hide the weight you’ve gained
recently anyway!” I’m a bit chubby
anyway but that comment ruined
the whole morning for me. I’m fed
up of people singling me out as the
fattest one in my group. They’re
all really skinny but I can’t ditch
my friends. I don’t wanna hear any
crap like that, ok?
Feeling Chubby.
Dear Feeling Chubby,
Chill woman!! Just tell your
mates not to comments on your
weight; instead ask for help finding
flattering clothes! Any excuse
to shop! If you think that you’re
overweight, then do something
about it, watch Mr. Motivator every
morning! If you are happy with
yourself and just feel that the world
is being harsh, well welcome to my
world!! Everyone has an impression
of the way they think people should
look, and the only view that matters
is your own! Stop reading Cosmo
and Elle etc. The pics are all air
brushed anyway! To the Hollywood
world, a size 6 is big, that’s scary
and totally unrealistic! There are
the guys who prefer a girl with a bit
of meat on her as they don’t want an
anorexic stick who’ll break if you try
and hug her! It’s better to hear the
truth from your friends, but there’s
a way for it to be said! Just tell
your mates they crossed a line, and
had better shut it or you’ll attack,
and lets face it, with the weight
advantage, you’ll win!
Dear Miss Conﬁdentiality...
Hey guys. I had to let the man
with a rant win this week!! The
pain!!! Save me from the same
fate and get thinking! Film tickets
up for grabs again! I’m here to
answer all you can throw at me!
