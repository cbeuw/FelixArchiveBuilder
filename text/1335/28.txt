ple like you and I have a chance of
making it? The answer is quite sim-
ply yes. One of the three guys on the
Olympic squad was a novice to start
with but quickly made his was up.
Incredible? Yes. Understandable?
No. But what I can tell you is that
the 120 Members of the boat club
aren’t all out just to win gold, in fact
most are here to have a laugh and to
try something new.
Being a novice has its advantages:
you get to race all around England
and even in Europe. You pay once,
a cheap amount, which takes care
of all your race entries, your train-
ing and gives you free access to a
very cool gym. Okay, so you need
to buy kit and optional regalia, but
who doesn’t like the funky looking
Imperial rowing regalia. Imagine
working out and having a bland but
sometimes coloured wall straight
in front of you, well that’s what you
get if you go to David Lloyd for
example. Now name me one per-
son who wouldn’t rather work out
looking over the river Thames, and
not having to pay between £75 and
£150 a month for membership for a
free towel (or two if you are lucky).
Alright, so it’s in Putney but that’s
only a quick bus or tube ride (30
mins, I do it nearly every day).
Five things you should know about
rowing:
1. You always row backwards
2. Most novice rowers catch crabs
(not the ones you want to eat)
3. Bowside’s on the right, stroke-
side’s on the left, but bow can be
a strokesider and stroke can be a
bowsider
4. Rowing training makes drinking
cheaper
5. Rowers like their Cox to be small
Now one of the best things are the
parties that come with the training,
and don’t sweat it, the members
club isn’t closed off to non-rowers.
Frequent parties are organised and
by the time this article comes to
print you would have missed our
Halloween bash on the river where
the only rule is drink and more
drink! If you weren’t one of the for-
tunate to hear about our fresher’s
parties, why not try our Christmas
Dinner on the 10th December. You
must be thinking, “Why should I go,
I won’t know anyone there?” Well
why not?
The novice squad’s first big com-
petition of the year is the Cambridge
Winter Head of the River, on the
19th of November, which is usually
a chance for the Imperial crews to
show the Cambridge colleges just
sport sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk
Imperial College Rowing has always
been a bit of a mystery to many, but
I hope that by the end of this article
you’ll come out thinking that it’s
much more than just a self indulging
group that hoard together and stick
to themselves.
So let’s start with a few facts.
We all know that the top squad are
good, but how good? Did you know
that they have won at Henley Royal
Regatta two dozen times, the last
time being the coxed four in 2004.
Why is this important? Well, Henley
is a very prestigious regatta which
each year attracts entries from as
far afield as the USA and Australia
along with the likes Oxford,
Cambridge and member of the GB
national squad. Need I say more?
However, that’s just the start of our
success. You may remember the
Sydney Olympics in 2000, when the
British eight won gold for the first
time in almost 90 years. Well 3 of
that crew, along with the coach who
trained them, were from Imperial!
So as you can see we aren’t doing
too badly. But how do we do it? By
having two very experienced coach-
es: Simon Cox, the new head coach,
whose track record at Molesey Boat
Club speaks for itself, and who was
also a lightweight gold medallist in
1994. Also who can forget Bill Mason,
the director of rowing (and ex-head
coach), who was GB women’s coach
for many years and was himself an
Olympian in 1972.
So, do ordinary, not so athletic peo-

how good they are and record the
first of a season of wins. You could
read about it in the next issue of
Felix, or better yet take a road trip
to Cambridge to see the novices in
action and shout “Go on IC!”’ at the
top of your voices as we go by. We
all like a good Cambridge beating,
and of course the town is also pretty
cool. Don’t forget after every race no
matter who wins there are always
great parties going on.
If you want to join what should be
a winning team, the novices will be
back at the river every Wednesday
and Saturday afternoon and new
recruits are always welcome. I hope
this has given you a bit of insight
into the world of rowing and I think
I speak for the whole squad when I
say I look forward to seeing you at
our next event.

I came across a rather mind-bog-
gling statistic. The national eupho-
ria we all enjoyed when the English
football team qualified for Germany
2006 has resulted in punters betting
over £500 million on England lifting
the trophy, roughly a £10 stake for
every man, woman and child in the
country. The stage is set. What could
be better than being crowned world
champions on the home turf of those
bloody Germans roughly 40 years
after the last triumph in 1966? Not
very many things I’m sure. That is
why investing at such paltry odds is
ill-advised.
All these economic patriots surely
deserve better odds than the 7/1
available? This brings me to my
point. Betting on England to win
represents poor value as the book-
makers odds are mainly influenced
by the fact that bookmakers know
that patriotic fans will part with
their cash no matter what. This is
to offset their potential for heavy
losses. Before you accuse me of
being another whinging-faced Jock
talking down your chances, I’d like
you to know that I want England
to succeed. I just wouldn’t put my
money on it.
Betting should be a dispassionate
transaction, uninfluenced by per-
sonal loyalty. This is why you won’t
find me backing my teams, Scotland
and Rangers, with my own cash.
I’d always be looking through blue
tinted glasses, ripe for exploitation
by bookmakers. Keep your money in
your pocket and only try and profit
from sports you can judge objective-
ly. Enjoy the spectacle. Good luck!
