Babar Ahmad
Mr Ahmad, a British citizen, is
alleged to have committed terror-
ist offences is the UK. For what
reason then is he being extradited
from his home nation.
Surely our judicial system should
be making the case against one of
our own citizens. The alleged acts
were committed here so therefore
the majority of the evidence (if
there is any) will be here.
The extradition of a suspected
terrorist to a foreign power, with-
out the need for a sufficient dossier
of evidence, has grave conse-
quences. Once extradited and tried
Mr Ahmad could face the death
penalty. We in Britain should stand
up for our values and not send a
fellow citizen to a country where
he may the ultimate price.
The US are the only superpower,
but that does not been we should
allow them to run the world in a
slip-shod manner.
Although, the new extradition
legislation allows British citizens
to be extradited to the US without
presenting a prima facie, there is
no reciprocal arrangement. How
can such double standards be
allowed?
Luca Manfredi
Incitement of violence and hatred
against any person is completely
unacceptable. The decision of
whether to pass the No Confidence
Motion against Luca Manfredi was
complicated by the fact that the
comments were made before he
took office.
But, how can anyone who
expresses such extreme views
represent such a diverse group of
students? If he were kept in office
due to a technicality what sort of
message would ULU be sending to
the students?
Manfredi said, “I distance myself
from those comments [I would
shot my gay son, etc], they are not
my views”. How can he state they
are not his views when he made
the comments.
It is disgusting that Manfredi,
made impassioned speeches to
ULU council declaring his “deep
regret”, but then admitted after-
wards that it was all “bullshit”. Can
you commit a lower act of deceit?
It is worrying that Sarah Khatib,
did not Vote for the Motion. One
would imagine that the students
she represents would have wanted
her to support the motion against
someone so bigoted

guard. I asked if I could keep the
card so that I would be able to go
at my own convenience to replace
the card. The response was that
the card was Imperial’s property
and was being taken off of me and I
would not be having it back. I have
no grievance with the manner of
the security guard-he told me he
was following your policy and to
contact you if I had complaint.
This policy of taking the old card
off me is a complete contradiction
to the policy of me having to have
my identity on show at all times.
Also due to the amalgamation
of print cards, photocopy cards,
union card and swipe card into one
‘master’ card I was left without
being able to do anything in terms
of being at college. This was a
great inconvenience. Had I known
previously that I had to have the
card changed (and that failure
to do so would have resulted in
removal of my card) I would have
done so. I would therefore like to
make a suggestion that if this is
the correct policy and the security
guard was following this that
you make an immediate change.
Perhaps it would be more sensible
to give all students with the old
card two weeks ‘amnesty’ to go
and get the card changed at their
own convenience. Then after that
implement the current policy of
removal.

Dress code
Dear Mr Mitcheson (College
Sectretary)
I am writing in regards to the policy
of removing old style Imperial swipe
cards (ones with crests on) from
students.
I was walking out of college
from the Prince Consort Road exit
yesterday (Wednesday 9th) at about
11:15 in order to go to the careers
fair in the union building. I was
challenged by a security guard and
upon inspecting my card he told
me I could not have it back as it
was now being recalled. Upon me
asking him what I should now do
without a card his response was
that I had to go and be reissued
with a new card. The office to do
this only opened at 12:00. I am the
Imperial 1st XI captain for hockey
and so was playing yesterday
representing the college. I have to
organise a squad of 12 players and
ensure that people meet at correct
times and get to the match as we
have to use public transport thanks
to the lack of funding provided for
sports at this university. I had no
opportunity to go and collect a new
card and would not be able that day,
which I explained to the security

replies;
Dear David,
I’m sorry that you have been the
victim of what appears to be some
overzealous security work. There
are only two reasons why a card
should be withdrawn; 1. the card
does not belong to the person car-
rying it, 2. the card is out of date.
The old style I/D cards are only
replaced on a needs only basis, i.e.
if they are damaged or stop work-
ing. Security Officers are instruct-
ed that they should only advise
Staff / Students to get a replace-
ment if they fall into this category,
but not to confiscate the pass. It
would appear that there has been
a breakdown in communications
with the security briefing for the
implementation of the new College
dress code, I have addressed this
and there should not be a recur-
rence of your unfortunate experi-
ence.
Kind regards, Ceri.

Dear Editor,
Appalled as I was by the College’s
announcement of a new ‘dress
code’ and ID cards policy, I was
delighted to see on Monday that vir-
tually all students and staff around
campus are doing exactly the right
thing and ignoring the new rules
completely. Rules like this can only
ever be enforced if the majority
go along with them, as the college
will be rather embarrassed if it
has to bar all 10, 000 students and
staff from entering campus! Apart
from introducing these rules with-
out any consultation, Sir Richard
has ignored a few obvious flaws in
the scheme, such as the fact that
Imperial College blatantly isn’t on
al-Qaeda’s Top Ten Infidel Targets
list, and no one can actually access
any rooms in any department (or
the library) without having a col-
lege swipe card anyway. The most
any ‘intruder’ might manage would
be to wander aimlessly around
Queens Lawn - clearly a critical
threat to each and every one of us!
As long as both staff and students
refuse to cooperate with these
rules, the college will find itself
forced to think again. Sir Richard,
you’re not at GlaxoSmithKline any
more - and we’re not at school!

Faculities merger
Dear Felix,
I was as shocked and angered that
the planed merger of the facul-
ties of Life Sciences and Physical
Sciences was decided upon without
any consultation of the students.
However some good can come of
it, why not let it be called the Royal
College of Science once again.
Imperial is a university with very
little sense of community, pride and
passion. My department alone has
had three titles in my year and a
bit here when I started last year it
was “The Department of Biological
Science”, then we became “The
Faculty of Life Science” and now
we will be “The Faculty of Natural
Science”.
As a life scientist I feel no sense
of departmental loyalty. However
I look upon the RSM with envy,
they all seem to be proud of their
tradition. They treasure it and it
gives them a great departmental
feel. Both RSM and C&G still exist
and very proactive in events and
activities, however RCS is hardly
mentioned. It seems to have been
wiped from the face of Imperial. If
the RCS was re-formed then we too
could have this sense of community,
with a tradition to be proud of, to
rival and surpass that of the RSM
and C&G.
Why not let us go back to the RCS?
We can bring back the tradition
and the sense of belonging that the
old Imperial used to have. When
Imperial was founded it contained
the RSM, C&G and the RCS. There
was intense competition and
rivalry between the three parts of
Imperial, be it on the sports field or
in the pub!
I feel that recreating the RCS and
bringing back the traditions and
practices that Imperial was founded
on will greatly improve our sense of
community and belonging. We can
once again be proud to not only be
part of Imperial (probably the best
university in the world) but can also
be proud of our department “The
Royal College of Science”.
