Andrea Faggiani
The mighty IC 6ths turned up at
Harlington for their first home game
of the season. Things were not look-
ing too good following Wednesdays
defeat away to LSE. Today was the
turn of Kings 6ths, who before this
were in top spot in the league with 4
games and 4 wins, having conceded
just 2 goals and scored 17. That
was soon going to change though.
Captain Andrea, still out due to the
horrendous knee injury sustained at
Queen Marys in the last game of the
last season back in March decided
to opt for a radically different forma-
tion. It was going to be a dynamic 3
5 2. Andriy “Shevchenko” Gelman
was in goal, with Adrien Doyle act-
ing as a sweeper behind Ricky Verra
and Tom Crockatt, whose job was
to mark the Kings strikers. Any Li
and Callum Little were acting as
wing backs, with Hamish McNelly,
Xiyong Huang, and Ben Hasted in
the centre of the park. Up front
Ian Mirandah and Simon “batman”
Parker were looking for the goals.
The game started off and Andrea’s
tactical awareness was soon appar-
ent. The Kings front two could get
nothing off us, and Andy and Callum
were controlling their wingers and
going forwards at just the right
times. Our centre mid trio was in
complete control and Ian and Simon
always looked dangerous.
About 30 minutes in the game
a quick move down the right saw
Simon centre the ball into the box,
with Andy screaming down the left
hand side and knocking the ball pow-
erfully past the keeper. 1-0!!! Kings
tried to get them selves together
and did play some good football, but
we were careful and focused until
the break. They had one shot on
goal, but Shev flew to the top right
hand corner and palmed the ball
away for a cracking save. We went
close on a couple of corners but
were happy to end the half with just
a slender lead. Rob Yates replaced
Callum at right wing back, and Nam
replaced Andy on the left. They had
run so much in the first half that
they could barely breathe!!!
The second half started with Kings
again on the front foot, trying to
attack us, but they were frustrated
by our constant breaks as soon as
we would get possession. It was one
of these breaks that led to our sec-
ond. As swift move on the right let
do a lightning quick one two between
Hamish and Ben, who then release
Xiyong in open space just outside
the Kings box. He unleashed a
furious drive with the outside of
his right boot which curled into the
top left corner almost breaking the
net. Amazing goal and we went
mental!!!!
Kings really started piling up some
pressure after this, and managed to
pull one back about 15 minutes from
time, with a long range effort by one
of their strikers. Not to worry. We
bounced back and didn’t let them
try to equalize. We went forwards in
numbers just like at the beginning
of the match, and a great through
ball found Ian one on one with the
keeper. Just like in previous games
the outcome of that is just one: goal.
3-1 and we were cruising!
And that’s how it ended. An awe-
some team performance all round.
Our defence was flawless, with AD
even making some surging runs
forwards and causing havoc in the
Kings defence. The midfield trio
was working wonders and the two
strikers always caused problems.
Callum, Nam, Andy and Rob ran
their socks off in their newly-dis-
covered wing back positions and all
played really well. Lets keep it going
lads! Bring it on!
For once the team managed to get
off to a remarkable start; there was
a full team of players, semi-compe-
tent umpires and Fanny Pants even
remembered the VAT receipt for our
trek to Kennington Park. Were these
omens for the match ahead?
The game started well with Top
Heavy managing to intercept the
push back and driving up into the
attacking half. However it took about
15 minutes before Ghostbuster man-
aged to get a quick pass to Grandma
who scored her first goal for IC.
GKT tried to pressure IC into giving
them the ball but they weren’t hav-
ing any of it. 1 Under, J.D., 3 Times
a Lady and India all worked hard to
make sure those medics didn’t get
hold of the ball which lead to some
great play by IC which was swiftly
followed by Grandma scoring her
second of the day. The half time
whistle went and after the usual
praise for ourselves, Fanny Pants
gave an inspirational half time talk.
It was time for more goal pie and to
beat the medic scum. We instant-
ly got to work with Porno, Butt-
F**cker and Laura working hard in
the middle to aid Grandma to her
hat-trick. The quick passing con-
tinued and Grandma got two more.
Play switched and after a few unsuc-
cessful short corners IC got their
sixth goal. No it wasn’t Grandma
that scored this but Top Heavy from
a sensational strike at the top of the
D. This was followed by a lapse in
concentration by India who deserv-
edly gained ‘Twat of the Match’ for
hitting the ball backwards between
her legs because she didn’t know
who to pass to! IC quickly got back
to form and gained a short corner
just as the final whistle blew. It was
a tense moment but was aided by
some inspiring team play. Grandma
pushed out, struck by Top Heavy,
kept in the D by Butt-F**cker, off
the back line by Porno finally before
Dominator scored her first IC goal.
This along with some great tack-
ling earned Dominator ‘Man of the
Match’. A special mention goes to
Fanny Pants who didn’t touch the
ball throughout the entire match.
The game was ended in the usual
way with team sprit, fantastic teas
and the usual frenzy at the union!

Tottenham lost to Grimsby in
September. Manchester United
were destroyed by York City in
1995. Hereford famously dumped
Newcastle out of the FA Cup in 1972.
Sugar Ray Robinson, the most com-
plete boxer of all time even man-
aged to lose to “The Leamington
Licker”, Randy Turpin all the way
back in 1951. The end of the Mighty
Mighty Sevens 100% start to the
season, however, is surely a sporting
upset to top them all.
“Several SOAS half-
chances were snuffed
out by Wongy and
Paul “the shark”
Schaack”
SOAS began the game brightly
and were clearly eager to have a
pop at the Sevens, who had up until
this point dominated ULU Division
4 ruthlessly. The absence of Coach
Duncan and his steel drum backing
band was clearly having a detri-
mental effect on the Sevens, who
were struggling to get into their
usual Brazilian-style samba rhythm.
Several SOAS half-chances were
snuffed out by Wongy and Paul “the
shark” Schaack at the back as IC
spent the majority of the first half
camped in their own, er, half and
were limited to trying to sneak a goal
on the break. Super Rich McSherry
went closest with a left footed drive
across goal after a great run down
the left wing. A SOAS goal had been
on the cards for a while when a rare
defensive lapse left their striker
one on one with our top secret tri-
allist goalkeeper (let’s call him M
Banger…actually, no, that’s too easy
let’s say Matty B – well come on, if
Family Guy can steal so blatantly
off the Simpsons then so can I) and
the striker made no mistake to give
SOAS the lead. The goal helped to
wake the sleeping Sevens from their
slumbers, and IC ended the half
with the first stirrings of Brazilian
fire in their loins.
Sam’s improved half-time team
talk fired the Sevens up, and the
equaliser came shortly after the
restart. I now have to deviate slight-
ly off-topic to explain the subject of
IC’s Fantasy Football league – you
pick a team made up of IC players
and score points according to who
scores, and, more importantly, who
gets the assists. IC football club
takes on a whole new level of impor-
tance when Fantasy Football begins.
Anyway, the reason I am
“The 7’s sat too deep,
SOAS scored 2 goals.
‘Balls’, as they say in
Bolton”
telling you this is because I got the
assist, and that gets me points. Oh
the goal was pretty good as well, Pas
poking the ball past the keeper after
running onto Sam’s lobbed through
ball (a.k.a: long ball). This was more
like it, and IC pressed hard for a
second. A chance came with a free-
kick on the corner of the SOAS area
and Sam’s beautiful curling cross
was nodded in by Sandy at the back
stick to make the score Sam Styles 2
assists – SOAS 1.
2-1 up with 10 minutes to play and
everything is looking “muito bem”
as they say in Rio…maybe. Well,
you know the rest. The 7’s sat too
deep, SOAS scored 2 goals. “Balls”,
as they say in Bolton.

“I don’t see the point in going to
sleep when you are drunk” has got
to be the quote of the day cour-
tesy of Tim and also summarised
the state of some of our players
on a cold Sunday afternoon down
in Raynes Park. The last minute
fill in for another team meant the
RSM turned up with an impressive
11 at the end of reading week. The
game started at a pace and contin-
ued so throughout the first half. It
was an especially close half, with
both teams matched in possession
and shots on goal. It ran into injury
time as Pikey took a particularly
bad hit to his foot from a well hit ball
just outside the D. This was after
Rach got confused as to which team
she was playing for and passed to a
Strollers player (note – playing for
the opposition the week before obvi-
ously is too confusing….)
After a relaxed interlude the game
got underway for the second half
with Tim running all over the left
wing with excellent support upfront
by Leon and Dasha. Despite Susie’s
many chances to score unfortunate-

Rachel Kershaw ly the RSM could not convert them
into goals.
Tom and Mike played to their usual
high standards running through the
centre causing problems for the
Strollers midfield. It was all even to 3
minutes before the end when as the
RSM were pushing up, the Strollers
got a quick break and despite our
goalie, Sam, playing a great game
with some brilliant saves up to this
point, was unable to close down a
well hit shot.
“RSM will be looking
for a reversal of the
score when they play
them again in a cou-
ple of week’s time”
The end came soon afterwards.
It was a fun game with Man of the
Match going to the much improved
John for covering the right wing
superbly and preventing many balls
going through to the defence and a
special mention going to Alice for
turning up very hung over and tak-
ing every opportunity to disappear
off to the toilets….. The RSM will be
looking for a reversal of the score
when they play them again in a cou-
ple of week’s time.
RSM Strolled over!
