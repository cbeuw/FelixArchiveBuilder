Is this more of an Ang Lee film? In
fact, is there such a thing as an Ang
Lee film?
A: I don’t think there is a typical
Ang Lee film. As long as I like the
story, I will make a film about it.
From what I know, when James
first showed me Annie Proulx’s
short story in The New Yorker
four years ago, the story spoke
to me and I had tears in my eyes
after reading it. It was a peculiar
and realistic version of American
life, never-before-captured on
film. The story was really refresh-
ing and it was great material for
a film. I guess most of the films
I’ve made point to repression, the
Chinese society going through
westernization, family drama and
how there is nothing constant in
life except change.
Q: What is more challenging in
making the show? Was the terrain
more of an obstacle or was it more
difficult to capture the emotional
bonds between the two leads?
A: The terrain was the only real
difficulty in the show. It was easy
to capture the emotions of the two
leads because they were both very
good actors. Heath Ledger is a
really adaptable actor and I decid-
ed to cast him as the lead after I
saw him in Monster’s Ball. I met
him in person and he really struck
me as someone who could bring
out the Western, brooding disposi-
tion much required in Brokeback
I
t starts off with quiet, serene
shots of the green plains in
Wyoming. Two cowboys, Ennis
Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and
Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal)
meet for the first time while they
line up for a summer job with local
rancher, Joe Aguirre. Ennis is quiet,
cautious and reserved while Jack
is emotional, loud and reckless. An
impossible match, they are stuck
with one another as they spend
the summer sheep-herding on
Brokeback Mountain.
Hidden from the judgmental eyes
of society on the quiet cloud-fringed
top of Brokeback Mountain, Ennis
and Jack gradually gravitate from
camaraderie into deeper intimacy.
When summer comes to an end,
the surreal connection they have
shared is put on a standstill as they
both leave Brokeback Mountain to
lead separate lives. Ennis remains
in Wyoming and starts a fam-
ily with Alma (Michelle Williams)
while Jack bumps around Texas and
catches the eye of aggressive rodeo
queen Lureen Newsome (Anne
Hathaway).
Four years later, a postcard arrives
for Ennis. Jack and Ennis meet up
again and in that one moment, it is
clear that the passage of time has
had no effect on the mens’ attach-
ment. In the following years, Ennis
and Jack struggle to keep their
bond alive and a secret from their
wives. Ennis becomes increasingly
estranged from Alma and Lureen
and Jack’s wedding loses out to
Lureen’s obsession with her father’s
company.
Will they or won’t they? Jack is
tired of living a lie. He wants to start
up a ranch with Ennis far away from
the narrow-minded perspectives of
society. However, scarred from a
childhood memory, Ennis refuses
to allow their connection to develop
into anything more than a series of
annual camping trips.
From a critique’s perspective, the
starting is a little slow but once the
story picks up, you feel like you
are caught in the spiralling of the
emotions between the two leads.
The acting is superb and the nar-
rative riveting. The background
is extremely picturesque and the
movie relaxing. The shots are raw,
emotional and the film is very richly
textured.
It is perhaps the only film I’ve
seen this year that comes close to
bringing me to tears (and I never
cry at movies).
Felix was lucky enough to meet
up with Ang Lee, the director of
Brokeback Mountain and here is
what he has to say about his shock-
er-of-a-film:
Q: This is a diverse breakaway
from your last array of films such as
Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.
his winter: Brokeback Mountain
Felix meets up with director Ang Lee to chat about his ﬁlm this winter
Mountain.
Heath Ledger is a really indi-
vidual person and hence he car-
ried the story and was the anchor
behind Brokeback Mountain.
Heath and Jake both had to go to
horse-riding camp as Jake needed
to learn how to ride horses and
they needed to learn to be at ease
with one another. During the film-
ing, we had to repeat the scenes
several times to make sure that
we nail each character. However,
Heath broke Jake’s nose as I told
them to kiss each other harder
than they would kiss a woman,
to ensure that the film can be as
authentic as possible.
Q: What made you decide to
cast Anne Hathaway as Lureen
Jackson?
A: It’s quite funny because she
came in to do a reading while she
was filming Princess Diaries 2.
She apologised for all her ridicu-
lous makeup and she just blew
her princess image away by doing
the best reading I’ve heard among
all the others who came for the
audtitions. Lureen Jackson was
a really important supporting
female character in Brokeback
Mountain. As there is no inter-
nal narrative in the film, Lureen
had to provide the feedback on
the struggles the main characters
were going through.
Q: What is it like being a director
from Taiwan in the States?
A: As a foreigner, I am more
likely to appreciate the subtext
of the film. I am also able to look
at a story with fresh eyes. In my
opinion, American movies shout
out at you while Chinese movies
are more subtle and rely more

on subtext. The films I make are
less likely to be typical American
movies and they are more of how
I see things in life. My dad never
encouraged me to be a movie
director, even after I got an Oscar.
However, he was the one who told
me to make a film, after a few
years of hiatus. Although I am
sure he never meant that I should
make a film about gay cowboys. I
felt a certain peace in making this
film. It was a healing experience
for me.
And what does Felix have to say
about the film?
In a nutshell, you have to watch it.
Some of you might be a bit deterred
by the fact that it is set in cowboy-
land (trust me, I don’t like cow-
boys that much.), but its the story
that makes it great and the cowboy
setting created the much-needed
obstacles for the two men. Some of
you (especially the straight men)
might also be put off the fact that
it is a gay love story but I believe
true love is a universal emotion that
defies all sexual preferences.
Love it or hate it if you must but you
must watch it. There isn’t another
film this year that is as good at
capturing the eternal struggle of
misfortuned lovers as Brokeback
Mountain.
