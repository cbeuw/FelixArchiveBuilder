mares, Harry (Daniel Radcliff)
is all too happy to escape to the
pulse-racing Quidditch World Cup
with his friends Ron (Rupert Grint)
and Herminone (Emma Watson).
However, something sinister lies
in wait for them: the Dark Mark,
the sign of the evil Lord Voldemort,
is ignited for the first time since
Voldemort’s disappearance.
Shaken by their experience at the
Quidditch World Cup, the famous
trio returns to Hogwarts: a place
kept safe by the talents and talons
of Professor Dumbledore. However,
peace is definitely not in the bag for
them this year as Hogwarts is about
tohosttheTriwizardChampionships.
Unfortunately for Harry, despite his
age definitely being below 16, he is
about to participate in the deadlie-
set game of the season.
For those who have read Harry
Potter, you’ll notice the increas-
ing presence of a dark forces with
each book. Mike Newell, of Four
Weddings fame and director of
this film, has perfectly created a
movie that captures the essence of
the Dark Lord Voldemort (played
superbly by Ralph Fiennes) and his
effect on the wizarding community.
Newell’s film may surprise some
of you who thought that the previ-
ous films weren’t up to much. Goblet
of Fire made me shriek, laugh and
cry. The scriptwriters have added
a few humourous scenes with Ron
(Rupert Grint) swearing even more
(he never did that in the books) and
Hermione (Emma Watson) imply-
ing that Victor Krum (Stanislav
Ianevski) would have liked a “more
physical” relationship with her; the
horror!
H
arry Potter is back with
another blockbuster
hit: The Goblet Of Fire.
Some of you will love it
but the rest may loathe
it. However, if you make the effort to
see this one, your opinion of Harry
Potter might be changed forever.
During the two and a half hours we
are taken through the highs and
lows of Harry Potter’s fourth year
in Hogwarts. Intense moments are
broken up by humour and breath-
taking special effects are inter-
spersed with poignant scenes. The
children are growing up and things
are changing for the worse in the
wizarding world.
When I first heard that I was going
to the National Press Screening of
Harry Potter: The Goblet of Fire, I
screamed (yes, I love Harry Potter
and I’m not ashamed of it). Although
I appreciated the entertainment
value of the first two films, film three
was what brought the books alive for
me for the first time. It was deep,
dark and moving. Goblet of Fire has
taken it once step further than the
rest, being a film lovers of the books
and novices alike can appreciate.
After a summer of haunting night-
Harry returns to Hogwarts, complete with dragons, mermaids and teenage angst
Dark times lie ahead, Harry...
Here’s your chance to
show off your fabulous
wizarding knowledge. The
person or persons who get
the most questions right
will win a pair of tickets to
see Harry Potter and the
Goblet of Fire at any Vue
Cinema. Email answers to
film.felix@imperial.ac.uk
before Monday.
If you decide to go you’ll be thor-
oughly entertained, but go with an
open mind. For those hardened
Harry Potter fans, you may have
high expectations but Newell misses
out Winky, most of the Quidditch
World Cup and the audience never
finds out how Rita Skeeter gets all
the gossip. At first this annoyed me,
as Hermione’s S.P
.E.W campaign in
the books stemmed from Winky’s
mistreatment at the hands of Barty
Crouch (played by Trigger, sorry
Roger Lloyd Pack), but Goblet of
Fire is too bloody long. Any longer
and there will be bladder-bursting!
