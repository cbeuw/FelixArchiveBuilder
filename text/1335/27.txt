A five mile run in a South-West
London park; seems easy enough
but add in the factors of heavy rain,
uneven terrain and a hundred or
so keen runners from all the other
London universities it became any-
thing but! Ladies and Gentlemen,
welcome to the Cross Country club!
My first session coinciding with
race day (every other Wednesdays)
– was hosted by Imperial in
Richmond park. Typical with most
outdoor sporting events in England,
the weather started closing in and
with less than an hour to the start of
the race it began to rain – the signs
weren’t good.
A brief warm up and a bit of social
banter between the universities and
it was time to race. The rain was
heavy by now. As a keen, social
runner myself, I hoped to do well,
prove my worth to the club and of
course beat some of the guys from
LSE. Unfortunately all hopes quick-
ly evaporated as half the runners
streamed by in the first 200m.
The course lived up to its name as
it was very much cross country. In
fact some parts were like running
in a river! I use the word ‘running’
loosely here because it was more
like a careful balancing act when
sliding down some slopes of the
course – and that’s when I was going
up the hills! I sometimes felt as
though I was on a “Cross-Country
Travelator” as for every 3 strides
forward, I’d slide one back! This
along with the constant stream of
girls overtaking me did not make for
an easy start to the race.
Determined to still do well and
to at least get back some lost confi-
dence (or may be it’s just from being
at Imperial too long) I decided to
follow the girls. With the increased
pace I started passing male runners
from each club, whom I presumed
were the less fit ones. How naïve
was I? My escalating confidence
was quickly shattered when the girls
finished and I was directed around
for another lap. No one told me the
ladies only did one lap and the men
two did they? It suddenly dawned
on me that everyone else was pac-
ing themselves! Knackered, it was
not really surprising that the next
lap was not as fast and the track
was in an even worse state than
before after so many fine athletes
had trampled over it. I did however
finish and managed to beat a few
people from the Imperial club.
After the race came some more
banter with the other universities,
team photo and a quick change into
relatively dry clothes. Again with
most sporting events in England it
was off to the pub for a couple of post
run beers and a chance to dry off by
a warm fire.
Now those of you who were in the
Union Wednesday night, you might
have been aware of some new faces
– especially female ones! This was
because Imperial Cross Country
also hosted the race social with a
few friendly beers and some gloat-
ing to the competition. Our men’s
first team are currently leading the
UL universities and our women are
second after some solid perform-
ances.
Me, well I had a few well earned
drinks – but not too many, I’m in
training for the next two laps of the
next race! For those of you who
enjoy running, whether it be com-
petitively or just to keep fit I recom-
mend the training sessions in Hyde
Park and also the races which are
challenging but great fun. Contact

My ﬁrst run – Race Day!
So we returned to our home pitch at
fortress Harlington, Having tasted
defeat the previous week we were
definitely gunning for victory in this
match. UCL 2nd XV started the
match top of the league but under
the guidance of Andy Wright we were
quick to show these jokers who the
daddies of London were. Within the
first 10 mins, James ‘Deep Throat’
Fletcher made a fantastic break,
offloading it to George Watkins to
run it in under the posts. Deep
throat slotted home the conversion
and after some quality work form
the forwards we found ourselves
on their ’22, where Deep Throat
took a quick pass from Penfold and
crashed through for the second try.
This was followed by
Alex “ the pain train”
Fergusson breaking
the UCL centre. The
poor lad was bleeding
from his head.”
UCL, slightly offended by the porn-
star rugby that was being played,
decided to try to mount a comeback.
After some fantastic defence from
Andy, Theo and the Brown Bullet
they finally broke our defence and
scored a try just before half time but
failed to convert. After a quick word
from Davey G things got underway
in the second half.
UCL still fired up scored and con-
verted, although that was the last
thing that they could muster. IC
stepped up a gear with some fantas-
tic recycling of the ball and flowing
moves led to more points. Johnny
‘I’ve lost my wallet’ the Jock, not
happy with reaching the try line,
battled like a warrior of Rhohan just
so he could score under the posts.
This was followed by Alex “ the pain
train” Fergusson breaking the UCL
centre. The poor lad was bleeding
from his head ….. anyway.
Some fantastic jumping from
James ‘Donkey Dick’ Davies meant
that the match was secured and
the fellowship of Silvia continues.
Next match we will mostly be beat-
ing Cantebury and Christchurch
– Again.

Chris Gosden
Andrea’s 6th team cartel arrived
on the turf in buoyant mood after a
convincing win against the Kingpin
of our division to keep us within a
drive-by’s distance of the leaders.
We started off well enough, enjoying
a good spell of possession for the
opening half hour, which we able to
capitalise on via a Hamish “I will not
date thou unless thou’s percentage
body fat is comparable to that of a
pork scratching” Mooknaley goal. A
deft cross into the erogenous zone
by Andriy from the right flank was
met by the Crouchy-esque stature
of the Mook, who took the ball onto
his left before slotting a ball pos-
sessing the pace of a maths lecture
past the static goalkeeper. Shev con-
tinued to dazzle with several wind-
ing manoeuvres whilst producing
longer runs than Jabba the Hut on
a laxative diet. The game soon fell
into a state of awkwardness when
inform Callum left the field injured
and we were forced to reshape. Like
a group of Karma Sutra novices,
we lacked the flexibility to adapt to
our new positions and consequent-
ly allowed the rest of the half to
slip silently into the rather solemn
atmosphere.
Having refreshed over the inter-
val, we returned to the pitch hoping
to play as smooth as we all think
we are when it comes to wooing
the ladies. Unfortunately we ended
up playing almost as rough as the
girls who actually believed us as we
struggled to find any true rhythm.
GKT inevitably resorted to their
beaver lever strumming ways as
their second half ref began his reign
of cheese churning. They main-
tained their consistently bad form
into the final “45” and we probably
would have ran more rings around
them than George Michaels’s been
in were it not for their unsporting
use of ringers, and the fact that
bestiality has lost its chic upon hear-
ing Mirandah’s tales of fingering
decapitated poultry.
The game remained out of sorts
until we eventually delivered the
final blow about 20 minutes from
time. The ball was scrambled out
from a corner before falling to Nam
“The Lyrical G” Nguyen, who poked
the ball to a bemused “Big” Ben
Hasted whose “intentional” scuff/
wannabe strike found its way to
Mooknaley to hit a well taken volley
into the back of the net. Now despite
scoring twice on the playing field,
for the benefit of McNelly, I feel it
necessary to quote a great general/
slave/gladiator, who once said: “Who
we do in life, echoes in fraternity,”
since scoring with spherical objects
should be restricted purely to the
green.
“GKT inevitably re-
sorted to their bea-
ver lever strumming
ways”
GKT finally decided to have a go
at us and somehow managed to
hit the woodwork twice before pull-
ing one back through a long range
effort which flew into the top corner.
Despite these minor incidents our
keeper Shaz played an impressive
game and our tight defensive for-
mation consisting of Ricky, AD and
Yong acting in a sweeper role meant
were we able to block more canals
than a Big Mac.
Captain Andrea continued to pimp
us bee-hutches from the sideline
throughout the match, although his
immense oral support left us con-
fused as to who should be doing
the pimping. (I think he charges £5
an hour anyway.) Simon “the Dark
Knight” and Ian Mirandah worked
tirelessly upfront to ensure they
covered more ground than the frik-
kin’ congestion charge, whilst Amin
and Robb “the nipple patch kid”
Yates preyed on the flanks.
The game eventually ended after
a 55 min half, but proved to be good
preparation for our next match,
which we played last Saturday.
Having arrived an hour and a half
late, GKT 5ths continued to be a
complete bunch of spoons from
which it was clear that their lives
had experienced as much personal
growth as an erection (although this
is construed as a compliment if you
consider IC 6th personnel). We drew
that match 0-0 in what was a frus-
tratingly disappointing match.
On a final note, our thoughts go
out to Callum Little, who efforts in
the GKT 4ths match were rewarded
with a fractured ankle. Get well soon
mate!
