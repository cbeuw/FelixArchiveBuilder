All-in-one fry up
A full fry up is the most impressive
item to be presented with in the
morning, though it can be a hassle
to organise; yolks go hard while
you save the toast from burning
and bacon gets left under the grill
by accident. Jamie Oliver came up
with the perfect solution: frying it
all in the same pan. Not only does it
make cooking easier, washing up is
a doddle too.
sausages
sliced mushrooms
eggs
tomatoes, cut in half
salt and pepper
bacon
drizzle of vegetable oil
1. Heat a large frying pan. Cut
however many sausages you want
in half lengthways and cook for a
few minutes until they lose some of
their pinkness. Place to the side of
the pan.
2. Drizzle a bit of oil on the
other side of the pan and fry the
mushrooms for a few minutes. Push
them to the side of the pan with the
sausage.
3.Place a few strips of bacon and
some tomato halves in the pan
and fry until the bacon gets crispy.
Turn and repeat until the other side
crisps up as well. By this stage the
tomatoes should have softened.
W
hilst nursing the inev-
itably fierce hangover
that followed a par-
ticularly debaucher-
ous Felix bar night, I
decided to dedicate the entire food
section to hangover cures, particu-
larly the ubiquitous fry-up. Ping and
Paul have once again been sent off
to various greasy spoons to assault
their waist-lines for valuable ratings
that will, hopefully, save some of
you spending money needlessly on a
poor fry-up. In the meantime I stuck
to good old home cooking.
For most students at Imperial,
mornings involve a last-minute dash
to college with breakfast being a
luxury for only the best of timekeep-
ers or those that favour it over a
shower. Cereal and toast are the
norm for most, although in halls a
friendly German student would hap-
pily munch away on German sau-
sage and krispbread every morning.
Many of us just tolerate our grum-
bling stomachs until we get a chance
to grab a pastry in the break.
On the weekend, however, eve-
rything changes. You can leisurely
tumble out of bed at midday with a
throbbing head and stumble to the
kitchen whilst trying to avoid any
mirrors for a strong cup of tea and a
good rummage in the fridge.

4. Shuffle round the contents of the
frying pan so everything is evenly
arranged and then crack 3 or 4 eggs
around the pan so they dribble out
between all the other items and help
everything stick together. Leave on
a low heat for a few minutes until
the eggs are done to your liking- you
may want to place the pan under a
hot grill to finish off the yolks.
5. Slide out onto a plate, cut into
portions and serve with buttered
toast.
Perfect poached eggs
I’ve never been a big fan of fried
eggs for breakfast, although I’ll hap-
pily dip my chips in one at dinner
time. I think everyone should try
poached eggs at least once. They
taste great from an egg poacher,
but because they’re expensive and a
pain to clean not even I own one. A
large frying pan or wok will always
suffice.
1 or more fresh eggs
salt and pepper to season
1. Pour boiling water into a frying
pan or wok placed over a high heat
until it is about 3 inches deep.
2. When bubbles start appearing
on the bottom of the pan it is ready
for the eggs. Crack them into the
water carefully, or alternatively
crack them into a cup and pour into
the water. The white should turn
opaque instantly if the water is hot
enough.
3. Leave for 3 minutes if you like a
soft yolk, or 5 if you prefer a harder
yolk. Dish out with a slice or a fork
and either serve straight away on
toast or pat dry on kitchen towel
if you’re worried it’s too watery.
Season with salt and pepper and eat
instantly on toast.
Yoghurt with muesli
If you really don’t think your stom-
ach can handle eggs or sausage
when you have a hangover, I have
found a suitable non-nauseating yet
filling alternative perfect for week-
days as well.
1 portion muesli,
4 tablespoons greek yoghurt
splash of orange juice (optional)
1. Add the yoghurt to the muesli,
stirring until it is all mixed. If you
feel it’s too thick for you add a few
splashes of orange juice which also
perks up the flavour. Add any other
fruit you fancy: chopped banana or
apples, blueberries, strawberries...
the list goes on. A teaspoon of honey
is always a nice addition.
Hair of the dog
Eating to raise your blood sugar lev-
els is all very well, but even doctors
will admit the best way to get rid of
a hangover is to turn to ‘the hair of
the dog that bit you’. What drink-
ing more alcohol the next day does
is effectively get you pissed again,
numbing the pain of the hangover
in the process. Try alcohol with fruit
juice; Bloody Marys (vodka, tomato
juice, Worcestershire sauce, tabas-
co) are perfect although anything
with orange juice will boost your
vitamin C levels to boot.
Above all though, avoidance is
always better than cure. Make sure
your friends pour a gallon of water
down your throat before you pass
out. Failing that get a medic friend
to hook you up to an IV line the next
day. CD-UK often helps too.
You’re probably all too familiar with
waking up on a Sunday morning
alone, cold and hung-over. In need
of a proven hangover cure and some
eye candy to raise the old body tem-
perature? Then Ping & Paul have
the answer....
Café Milan, 23 Old Brompton
Road, London , SW7 3HZ
Bacon,Sausage,Beans,Scrambled
egg, Mushrooms, Toast, Tea
Rating 7/10
Opens really late on Sundays for
some strange reason... it took us a
while to figure this out, but being
right next to the Lamborghini show-
room, the food should have racing
pedigree.
And indeed the food service here
was quick and the food looked
appealing. I’m not sure that the
whole thing wasn’t microwaved, the
sausages lacked any tell-tale frying
burns and were a worrying shade
of pink. The rest of the breakfast
was pretty standard, but they don’t
do fried eggs, making us think the
scrambled eggs probably come
from powder. The toast here though,
was the best of any of the café’s
we’ve reviewed. Toasted in a panini
machine and buttered rather than
margarined, I would go back just to
order extra toast.
Again the waitresses grumble at
you in some foreign language, but
what the hell, 2/3 of all communica-
tion is via body language.
Benjys, 157 Earls Court Road,
London, SW5 9RQ
Builder’s Breakfast £3.70 – 2 bacon,
2 sausages, egg, beans, toast, chips,
unlimited tea or coffee
Rating 9.5/10
The food here is not of the high-
est quality, nor is the restaurant
as fancy as some of its South Ken
counterparts but Benjys is the pure
definition of a greasy spoon café. It
can be smoky, and full of random-
ers, but if you appreciate a proper
breakfast then this is the only place
for you. Likewise, the waitresses
here aren’t leggy blondes, are liable
to grumble at you in some eastern
European language, but first thing
in the morning, there is no prettier
sight. The waitresses are friendly,
petite, eager to serve (food) and
believers of quick service. Go there
for an entire year ordering no beans
and an extra egg and eventually
even the fittest (worst) waitress will
recognise you and remember your
order.
Having lived in Earl’s Court last
year, once we had found this place
there was never the need to eat any-
where else. They cater to all sizes of
appetite, from ‘standard’ breakfast
to the house speciality and my per-
sonal favourite, the ‘builders’ break-
fast – the only meal you will need to
last you about a week. Two rashers
of bacon, two sausages, fried egg,
beans, 2 slices of toast, chips and
unlimited tea.
Can you feel the love?
Café Primo, Old Brompton Road,
South Kensington
£4.50 – Spanish Omelette
Rating 5.5/10
I admit it – this café shouldn’t qual-
ify for direct comparison because it
doesn’t offer full breakfasts, but this
is the one with the incredibly perfect
waitress, so I just couldn’t walk on
by this time.
Its prices are definitely SW7,
as is the swanky modern decor.
The outside decking area would
be nice in summer, but on a cold
November morning I was wishing
I was indoors. I’m pretty sure that
Spanish omelette normally means
a big thick omelette with potato in
it, rather than an eggy mush of pep-
pers and ham... but it was nice, and
was served with a side salad, which
is certainly a healthier alternative
than my usual fry-up.
On the down side, the service was
slow (there was even time to go
buy Ben’s Cookies from across the
street to stop our stomachs digest-
ing themselves) and we managed
to get a new waitress on her second
The Breakfast Club
with Ping and Paul
Toast at Café Milan: griddled and buttered to perfection
day who was confused the whole
time. The pain au chocolat could
have been Tesco value, and wasn’t
even warm. I wished I had gone to
the JCR for that instead.
We didn’t get to see that J-Lo look-
alike waitress until we were just
about to leave. But it made our day,
and improved the café’s rating.
In light of our deteriorating health,
and shape..... we’re taking a break
from fry-ups, and the next review
will be exploring more healthier
cuisines.
