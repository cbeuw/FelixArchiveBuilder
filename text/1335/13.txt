Stella McCartney’s one-off collec-
tion for H&M went on sale at the
Oxford Circus branch at 9am this
morning and already it is looking
somewhat sparse in there. The one-
off collection comprises of around
40 different pieces. The clothes are
based on the designer’s favourites
from her previous collections.
“It’s like a food mountain for hun-
gry people,” said one onlooker as
the queue of Stella fans, who had
been lining up outside the store
since just after 7am, surged inside
and started grabbing everything in
sight. “Or feeding time in the hyena
cage,” added one hopeful shopper
who decided it was a battle she
couldn’t face this early. The collec-
tion of skinny jeans, sparkly jack-
ets, playsuits and chiffon dresses
has caused even more of a stir
than Karl Lagerfeld’s H&M collec-
tion last year and is bound to sell
out by the end of the day. So who’s
next? “Our head office in Sweden
hasn’t confirmed which designer
they will approach next year, or
even if they are planning another
collaboration,” said Zoe Nicholls,
“it’s like a food
mountain for
hungry people”
Think you’re
fabulous?
Do you think you’re fashionable?
Send me a picture with you name
and department. If I agree then
your picture could be in the next
the London-based PR for the high
street label. “I can’t believe the reac-
tion to this one”.
I admit it would have been nice to
be the first to buy the Stella outfits,
however I feel the clothes are too
popular for my liking. As a true
fashion snob I believe individuality
cannot be attained from popularity.
However, there are some circum-
stances when I could happily wear
chav-tracksuits and scrape back my
hair, such as prison.
An 18-year-old girl has won her
bid not to wear an electronic tag
because it didn’t go with her out-
fits. Prosecutor Douglas Marshall
suggested that Natasha Hughes,
described by Worcester Magistrates
Court as a woman who likes to dress
in a feminine way, should be forced
“ 18 year old
wins bid not to
wear electronic
tag as it didn’t
go with outfit”
Stella es!

to wear a tag as she had breached
the terms of her bail curfew. But
the judge let her off, according to
Metro. “I didn’t want to wear a tag
because they are bulky and embar-
rassing. I like to wear skirts which
means people can see it, and it looks
stupid.” Whatever next? Alexander
McQueen designing prison outfits?
There are times when Dolly can
be a bitch. I must eat humble pie
and tell you all that Crispin is a true
gentleman and that his socks are
great!

Northern Lights, The Sutble Knife
and The Amble Spyglass
by Phillip Pullman
My 2 Pence: Perfect. Story, char-
acterisation, readability, quality of
writing, pace – everything. I can
come up with no criticism of this
incredible story; it is one of the
most enjoyable reads I’ve ever come
across and probably the most origi-
nal story by far – this NEEDS to be
read.
Philip Pullman’s fantasy trilogy
exploded onto the scene to a mon-
umental reception several years
ago. After a seemingly endless list
of rave reviews from every major
reviewer and publication around at
the time, it scooped up a huge string
of awards as well, and gained Mr
Pullman tremendous international
acclaim. It has successfully endured
its fair share of controversy as well
– with a story that takes a blatant
stab at Catholicism and several of
its teachings. I should stress that
Philip Pullman’s message is not one
of hatred towards the Church or
of atheism but one that most peo-
ple accept without giving voice to
– that a person can live a good life
without an institution ‘guiding’ their
steps and dictating what is right and
wrong.
Mr Pullman’s story is a remark-
able achievement – it manages to
condemn the Church as an institu-
tion created to control people’s lives,
while still telling a powerful story
that is undeniably tragic and memo-
rable. The story revolves around
Lyra and Will, two adolescents from
parallel worlds similar to each other
that get caught up in a war of bibli-
cal proportions. Without revealing
too much, it is impossible to truly
give an idea of just how deep and
complex this story is, not least how
wide-ranging its subject matter –
from the nature of angels and God,
the oppressiveness of the Church to
quantum physics. As if such ancient
conundrums were not difficult
enough to juggle, the author also
manages to delve into the mean-
ing and nature of love, friendship
and sacrifice, tingeing his story with
humour, wit and bitter irony.
This creation epitomises what
good storytelling is all about – the
right pace, tension, multidimen-
sional characters and the perfect
ending. Include a narrative that is
very readable and incredibly com-
pulsive, and you have the perfect
novel. The author has the rare abil-
ity to make the reader keep turning
pages, as well as a real gift for prose
– neither patronising in its simplic-
ity nor daunting in its complexity.
As to the characters, the author
has made a very difficult, but very
commendable move to make them
all anything but cliché – there is no
‘good’ or ‘bad’ character, every one
of them does what seems right in
the situation they are confronted
with. This level of realism seen in
each character only adds more to
the reader’s fondness of the pro-
tagonists – making the tragic ending
all the more powerful.
One aspect of this piece of writ-
ing that merits comment is the fact
that this is a Fantasy book – set in a
universe with different possibilities
and clearly one sprung from the
author’s amazing imagination. Not
outlandish enough to be considered
escapist, it is neither a cheap car-
bon-copy of Lord of the Rings nor
is it simple enough to be standard
fiction. No, a great level of thought
can clearly be seen in the universe
Mr Pullman presents to us – with
a great deal of charm and original-
ity that is still so congruent with
our everyday lives that the book
remains with the reader long after
it ends.
This is a story that needs to be
told and is presented in a piece of
writing that deserves to be read. It
is magical yet real, with a sense of
warmth that can only be accompa-
nied by tears and a satisfaction that
will ensure the reader returns to it
over and over again, to relish in the
brilliance of a true masterpiece.
“this creation
epitomises
what good sto-
rytelling is all
about...”
