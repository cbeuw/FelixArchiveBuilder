100% record intact!
Ladies Football
City University XI 1
Imperial College XI 3
Chloé Joyeux
The ladies football travelled to what
seemed the most isolated part of
London on this wintry Sunday. The
opponent’s grounds were public
grounds with rather dodgy show-
ers and changing rooms. Despite
this unwelcoming arrival, the ladies
walked out onto the pitch desper-
ate to keep up their 100% record in
ULU.
The weather proved to be typi-
cally English and was awful. Rain,
backed up by wind, affected vis-
ibility throughout the match. After
about 25 minutes of hard play from
both sides the IC ladies stamped
their superioriy on the match. Lizzie
made an amazing cross from the
side line, which caused confusion in
the City defence, and an own goal
was scored by the opposition, con-
firming the advantage to the IC side.
Many other goal opportunities were
missed as the opposition’s keeper,
the biggest girl of their team, proved
to be worthy of her position. With
this first goal however, although not
entirely deserved, confidence was
gained and a strong shot from within
the keeper’s box was soon delivered
by Chin, the team captain in person,
which lobbed the City keeper and
ended up in a second goal.
The City ladies, however, did not
surrender this easily and gave the
defence some difficulty with their
counter attack. A certain number
8, in particular, proved hard to con-
trol, and despite Chloé (dame of the
game) and Jools’ efforts at taming
her, she managed to score the third
goal of the match, bringing the score
to 2-1. Half time was blown and the IC
ladies welcomed the rest.
The start of the second half was
more tense, as the IC side missed
many goal opportunities and start-
ed becoming frustrated by their
absence of luck. Poppy, second dame
of the game, had many efforts on
goal as well as very good controls

but the score remained static. The
defence continued to be strong,
carried by Dill and Kathy letting
the ball through on rare occasions,
most often created by the number
eight, their star player and cap-
tain. Ten minutes into the second
half changes were made on the IC
side. Vanee then took on the job of
marking number eight; she stuck
to her like glue for the remaining
time, giving her great difficulty,
although ending up socializing with
her afterwards.
Fifteen minutes into the second
half one City defender passed back
to her goalie, who was caught by
surprise and barely escaped a sec-
ond own goal. Lizzie took this oppor-
tunity to tap the ball into the back
of the net, bringing the score to
3-1. The game ended with another
win for the IC ladies, who remain
unbeaten this season in ULU.
