A
child’s IQ is tested and is
found to be at genius lev-
els, while another child
in the same classroom
struggles, exhibiting
inattention and hyperactivity. Later
in life, one of these children devel-
ops Alzheimer’s and slowly begins
to forget who she is.
It has been said that ‘the mind
works in mysterious ways’. But how
much of this mystery can be solved
by looking at the genes that we
inherit from our parents and how
much by looking at the environment
that we were raised in?
On8NovemberattheDanaCentre,
three psychologists attempted to
clarify to what extent the genes we
inherit impact the development of
our brains, our behaviour and our
susceptibility to disease, and to what
extent the environment influences
our development.

tion in infants. According to him,
both genes and environment play
a large role in development. Genes
operate within environments, he
said. Neurons in the brain come rel-
atively pre-configured in their func-
tion at birth, but they are designed
to respond to stimuli in the baby’s
environment. It’s almost as though
nature has built in an expectancy to
these environmental stimuli, Hood
said.
Mark Hanson, director of
the Centre for Developmental
Origins of Health and Disease at
the University of Southampton,
researches the influence of our past
on our health, behaviour and risk
of disease. According to him, there
are numerous ‘pasts’ to study. The
path of human evolution illustrates
our distant past, while our more
recent past relates to our neo-natal
environment.
According to Hanson, a mismatch
between pre-natal and adult envi-
ronmental conditions leads to great-
er risk of disease. Therefore, if the
foetus receives poor nutrition in the
womb and grows up to eat a very
high-calorie diet, for example, then
the person has a much greater risk
of becoming obese, having heart dis-
ease, etc.
In a paper published in Science in
September 2004, Hanson contended
that mothers send messages to their
growing child that allow the baby to
predict the environment it is likely
to live in after birth. The foetus
then adapts its physiological devel-
opment to ensure it has the best
chance of survival in that expected
future environment. For example,
if a mother is extremely stressed
during pregnancy, she conveys the
message that it’s a dangerous world
to her unborn child, influencing the
child’s stress responses later in life.
Sir Michael Rutter, a professor of
developmental psychopathology at
King’s College London, is doing a
long-term study on children adopt-
ed from Romania by UK families.
These children were brought up in
deprived conditions in the institu-
tional system in Romania and were
adopted by “slightly better than
average” British families, he said.
Rutter’s research is looking into
how these deprived conditions after
birth affect these children’s develop-
ment. The most significant finding
is that children who were in these
deprived conditions for less than
six months showed no more impair-
ments than children in the general
population. These impairments
included autistic-like patterns, intel-
lectual impairments, inattention
and hyperactivity. After living for
six months in these conditions, how-
ever, children exhibited higher than
normal levels of multiple impair-
ments.
These findings show that it takes
a bit for these conditions to register,
Rutter said. But once they do, their
effects are significant and hard to
reverse.
Overall, the psychologists agreed
that both nature and nurture play
a large role in the development of
the brain. So it seems that in most
cases we are who we are because
of our parents, no matter which way
we look at it.
The next Dana Centre program is
“Einstein’s greatest theory” on
22 November at 7pm.
On 19 December 1999, under clear
and starry skies at the Kennedy
Space Centre, the space shuttle
Discovery lifted off at 18:50 CST,
lighting up the central Florida
coastline, to send Commander
Curt Brown, Pilot Scott Kelly, and
5 mission specialists on a two-day
chase to catch and retrieve the
12-tonne Hubble Telescope. At the
time of launch Hubble was sail-
ing over Eastern Africa and had
been in hibernation since the loss
of a gyroscope in November that
year. Hubble’s need for precise
orientation to carry out its scien-
tific work requires at least three
out of the six on-board gyroscopes
to be in order. After the failure in
November that year it only had
two and, although safely sleeping
in orbit, was inoperative.
Two days later, when Discovery
reached a point about half a
mile away and directly beneath
the telescope, Scott Kelly and
Commander Brown took manual
control of the Shuttle to gently
manoeuvre the 110-tonne orbiter
to within feet of Hubble and cap-
ture it with a robotic arm. Once
the telescope had been secured in
the payload bay, the crew released
the arm and used it to perform
a television survey of Hubble’s
exterior. After three servicing
spacewalks the telescope’s rede-
ployment took place at an altitude
of 370 statute miles. As the two
spacecraft flew over the South
Pacific’s Coral Sea, Hubble’s aper-
ture door opened to the heavens
once more. That night the crew
went to bed just before midnight
shuttle time and woke to a day
of preparations for landing. After
seven days in space Discovery
was in a 363 by 380 statute mile
orbit with all systems on board
performing well.
Six years later we have the
pleasure of welcoming Scott Kelly
to Imperial to give a talk about his
experience in space and the future
of NASA’s space programme. He
will also try to persuade us that
we have made the right decision
by choosing to study science,
and that society needs scientists
and engineers like us. Astronaut
Kelly is assigned to be the com-
mander of the STS-118 mission to
the International Space Station to
install solar power arrays when
the Shuttle fleet returns to flight in
the near future.
The event is organised with the
help of the International Space
School Educational Trust (www.
isset.org), who are Scott’s hosts
in the UK, the Imperial College
Astronomy Society and Imperial’s
Outreach Office.

Brief
Link lost with asteroid robot
Japan’s space agency has lost
contact with a robotic probe
that it dispatched to explore
the surface of an asteroid,
according to reports. The small
probe called Minerva was
released from its mothership
Hayabusa on Saturday, but
officials say its “current status
is still unknown”. Hayabusa
is hovering near asteroid
Itokawa, in preparation to col-
lect surface samples for return
to Earth. It should begin its
return voyage to Earth next
month to arrive in 2007.
Technical hitch delays Ariane 5
The launch of Europe’s Ariane
5 rocket – initially due on
Saturday in French Guyana
– has been delayed by sev-
eral days following a technical
hitch. Operator Arianespace
says it will move the rocket
from its launch pad to work
on the unspecified problem.
A spokeswoman says a new
launch date is unlikely before
Tuesday. The heavy-lift vehicle
was set to blast-off carrying its
largest payload yet of two tel-
ecoms satellites weighing more
than eight tonnes.
UK sites in acid rain ‘recovery’
Some of the UK’s most envi-
ronmentally sensitive upland
lakes and streams are recov-
ering from the impact of acid
rain, the government has said.
Acidic sulphur in Britain’s
water has generally halved in
the last 15 years, according to
new research showed.
