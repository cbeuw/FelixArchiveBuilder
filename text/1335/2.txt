If Imperial’s intentions to leave
the University of London weren’t
enough to precipitate its break-
up then the Quality Assurance
Agency’s (QAA) concerns about
the University’s degree awarding
powers should certainly help. The
QAA, the organisation responsible
for improving standards in higher
education, seems to have doubts as
to how UL can award degrees when
it has nothing to do with teaching
or setting the standards for them.
These doubts have led to the QAA
refusing to give the university a vote
of broad confidence.
The University of London’s vice-
chancellor, Sir Graeme Davies, has
entered into talks with the QAA to
try and convince them to give the
university a vote of confidence. If
the QAA decide not to, the UL
’s
international reputation would be
badly damaged, which may cause
many of the colleges that make up
the UL to breakaway.
The QAA, while approving of
the quality of degrees awarded
by the constituent colleges of UL,
is unsure of the university’s pre-
cise role in awarding degrees. Sir
Graeme believes that the QAA has
not understood how the university
is structured: “There has been a
misunderstanding of how the feder-
al university works. The university
is the colleges and the colleges are
the university” is how Sir Graeme
explains it. He argues that if the
QAA are satisfied with the colleges
then that should extend to the rest
of the university. He believes that
it is immaterial who awards the
degree as long as the degree is of a
high standard.
Proponents of Imperial’s separa-
tion from UL might disagree. It
could be argued that a degree from
Imperial will be better recognised
by potential employers than a UL
degree. It is unlikely that Imperial’s
reputation as an institution would
be affected by the change.
Imperial’s most senior commit-
tee meets on December 9th to
decide whether Imperial will award
its own degrees; the future of the
University of London is in the bal-
ance. If QAA does not give a vote
of confidence to UL and Imperial
decides to effectively leave the uni-
versity, it’s unlikely that UL will live
to see out 170 years.

In last week’s Felix (1334) we stated
that the University of Kent was tak-
ing over at Imperial’s Wye cam-
pus. However, Professor Leszek
Borysiewicz, Deputy Rector of
Imperial College, has told Felix that
“Wye continues to be an important
part of the College and we remain
committed to it for the long-term.
While the Faculty of Life Sciences
closed down land-based courses
there due to financial necessity, a
separate review is examining other
ways in which the campus can be
best used”.
Imperial is currently in discussion
with the University of Kent over
the delivery of Applied Business
Management (ABM), the only under-
graduate course currently recruit-
ing at Wye. The proposal, which is
subject to ratification by the govern-
ing bodies of both institutions, states
that the 2007 student intake on this
course would be taught by Kent and
Imperial staff on the Wye campus,
under appropriate financial agree-
ments.
New students enrolling from
2007 would receive a University of
Kent degree and, in recognition of
Imperial’s ongoing involvement,
Associateship of Wye College.
Existing ABM students – and those
accepted for a place in 2006 – would
continue to receive a University of
London degree and Associateship
of the Royal College of Science from
Imperial. ABM academic staff based
at Wye would transfer to University
of Kent, but retain honorary links
with Imperial. This agreement cov-
ers only the ABM degree and does
not alter Imperial’s continued pres-
ence at the Wye campus.
Contrary to Wye students com-
plaints of poor communication from
College, Sir Leszek said, “Student
union representatives have been
consulted by the Faculty of Life
Sciences.”
Is the end nigh for the
University of London?

Wye update
propriate as he made the comments
before he came into office. Musatafa
Arif, former President of ICU said,
“it would set a dangerous precedent
to no confidence people on stuff that
happened before they came into
office”. However, other delegates
suggested that someone with such
extreme views is not suitable to rep-
resent a diverse body of students.
Many delegates questioned why
it had taken Manfredi so long to
issue an apology. Chris Heathcoate
from LSE asked whether he was
“doing it to keep your job, or do you
mean it?”. Manfredi said he was
not doing it “just too hang onto my
job”, but later in the Malet street
bar he admitted his apology was
“all bullshit”.
The motion was passed with 27
votes in favour of the motion, 5 del-
egates voted against, one of whom
was Mustafa Arif. Sarah Khatib,
ICU Deputy President (Education
& Welfare) was among 5 delegates
who abstained from voting. For the
motion to pass a two-thirds majority
was required so in effect an absten-
tion is a vote against as each absten-
tion reduces the fraction of votes in
favour of the motion.
Alon Or-bach, of Imperial,
expressed dismay at Khatib’s
decision to abstain, “We elect our
Welfare Officers to take a stand
against discrimination in all its
forms. Abstaining from a vote of no
confidence in the ULU Chair who
has made homophobic remarks,
making it easier for the motion to
be defeated, is a neglect of duty.
Our Welfare Officers should be pas-
sionate advocates of equality in our
universities; we don’t expect them to
stand back and plead impartiality.”
Sameena Misbahuddin, Imperial
College Union President, who was
not present and therefore could not
vote on the issue told Felix, “to make
such comments as he did against
any part of community is unaccept-
able, - especially for someone hold-
ing a position like he does.”
