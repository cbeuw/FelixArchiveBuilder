ALBUM REVIEWS
So November is here, the clocks
have turned back, the days draw
shorter and the wind blows colder.
Every foreign student is now asking
themselves why they chose to study
on such a cold barren island as
Britain when they could be in sunny
Greece or wherever they’ve come
from. What better music to capture
the mood then, or so I thought when
I picked up a copy of The Crimea’s
latest album. With the title, Tragedy
Rocks and track titles such as Bad
Vibrations, Miserablist Tango and
Someone’s Crying, I was sure that
it would be great accompaniment
to the season’s melancholy. But
oh how wrong I was, this albums
is tragic, but for all the wrong rea-
sons.
The album starts of promisingly
enough, with a delicate minor-key
waltzlike piano solo opening up the
first track, White Russian Galaxy.
It pulls you into a trap of thinking
this album is going to be something
different. But 30 seconds on, and
it fades, only to be replaced by the
most boring pedestrian indie riff,
and a lead singer with a bland and
yet annoying voice. This shift from
piano waltz to anodyne indie pop
is probably the worst thing on this
album, god knows why they thought
it would be good idea to put it as the
first track or indeed, on the album
at all.
Although the rest of this album
is better than that ground zero
moment, that really does not say a
lot. The rest of the album carries
on with the boring indie pop theme,
which fails totally in trying to convey
the images associated with its bleak
track titles and lyrics, and remains
about as adventurous as an Adam
Sandler movie. Still, it’s not all bad,
there are a few relatively good tracks
on the album, the best of which is
probably Gazillions Of Miniature
Violins. Unlike most of the other
tracks on the album, it takes on a
more expansive sound, creating a
lush soundscape and breaking the
monotony which seems to permeate
throughout the album. It’s a shame
then, that the lead singer tries his
hardest to wreck it, with his stupid
voice, as with every other track on
the album.
In conclusion, there is really no
point in getting this album, or any
real point to the album itself. There
is absolutely nothing special about
this album, the vast majority of
tracks are plain, pedestrian, unin-
teresting, and can be found ad infini-
tum throughout the history of music.
Nothing separates this band from
the sea of mediocrity which can be
found in any provincial town’s local
band scene. The only good points
on this album is when the band
try something different, but these
moments too rare and far between.
Sure, there are a few decent tracks
on this album, but it really isn’t
worth your time, money or effort in
finding them. Tragic indeed.

Before you read this, I feel obliged
to let you know that I love, no adore
Blink-182. I grew up with them, lis-
tened to little but them when I was
young and naïve, and as a result the
following may be a little biased and
non-objective, but never mind.
So, Blink-182 have a Greatest
Hits album, one last money mak-
ing opportunity since their hiatus
turned split. This album, with its
chronological order is perfect for
those who only jumped on the Blink
bandwagon post-All The Small
Things and shows what a trans-
formation this band made lyrically,
musically and most noticeably the
level of maturity throughout their
career.
Carousel is the perfect opening
track, and along with M+M, are
representative of how raw and sim-
ple the band were when they were
starting out, and approximately
the correct age for the songs they
were singing. By Enema Of The
State and Take Off Your Pants And
Jacket, there was something slight-
ly strange about a nearly 30 year-old
man singing about being a teenager,
however that is how Blink-182 had
such a devout teenage following-
songs you could relate to and songs
that planted the appealing thought
in your mind that you too could be
young forever.
Then they came along with their
eponymous album, got married and
had kids, and started singing about
things that weren’t funny any more.
That’s where they lost it for me,
however, seemed to gain a new set
of fans with their mature stance
on pop-punk. As a result, most of
the material included on this album
is from their latest album, with
noticeable absences of Mutt, Rich
Lips and Going Away To College.
Additionally, there is no secret or
surprise ‘new’ track, just one last
fresh taste of a mediocre radio ver-
sion of Go.
Before Blink-182, there was Green
Day. Now we have Green Day again
and don’t really need Blink-182 any-
more. It’s no loss, their Greatest
Hits is a lovely way to say goodbye

I waited four years for this album so
it was pretty likely that the actual
songs would constitute an anticli-
max rather than a feast of the sens-
es. This is the type of album that
grows on you, though. It is also a
historic Depeche album as it is the
first one to contain songs written by
vocalist Dave Gahan. The dictatorial
Martin Gore (writer of all DM songs
after Vince Clarke’s departure fol-
lowing the release of the first album,
Speak & Spell) has evidently sof-
tened down a bit and given up some
creative space for other people.
The music is not soft, though.
This is not a logical follow-up to
the extremely chilled-out, velvety
Exciter (2001), it is more that to
Gahan’s moody solo LP Paper
Monsters. The general atmosphere
created by the songs in the listen-
er’s mind is definitely dark, almost
anguished. It is a return to the clas-
sic Depeche sound of Music For
The Masses and Violator, where
Kraftwerk meets Sarah Bernhardt,
where angels and demons fight
for eternity; austere but polished
sounds full of drama and layered
depth.
This album is very in-your-face
compared to the emotional but sub-
tle, even light-hearted at points,
Exciter. The music is very inor-
ganic, Bauhaus-like at times, other
times more like New Order. None of
the songs have much hit potential
(but who cares about that), except
maybe the first single, Precious, a
very typical DM track, reminiscent
of the eighties sound. The gem of
the album is Suffer Well, written by
Gahan. This is surprising as Gahan
is still a relatively inexperienced
songwriter. Perhaps this is indica-
tive of the trio’s future sound, influ-
enced progressively more by the
singer’s aesthetic views. Also, it is
clear Gahan has gained a lot of con-
fidence in terms of his role in the
band: he has never sung better. The
same cannot be said of Mr Gore: the
worst songs in the album, Macro
and Damaged People, are sung by
him, and he is whinier than ever.
Gore’s lyric-writing has lost some
of its freshness; his main obses-
sions (faith, sin, the fragility of love,
despair) are once again the recur-
rent themes of the album. However,
hedealtwiththesethemesmuchbet-
ter in Songs Of Faith And Devotion
in 1993. The imagery is not very orig-
inal: it’s devils, and dark angels, and
painfully sexy women (as described
in Lilian, track number 11) once
again. Anton Corbijn, a visual artist
who has worked with the band (as
responsible for the videos and stage
design) since the eighties, has done
a great job with the album sleeve
design. The angel in the cover is
a hybrid between a chicken and
Robert Smith. In summary, not a
bad Depeche Mode album, espe-
cially considering that they have
re-invented their sound once again.
The band has returned to the Dark
Side, but through new paths.
