Joseph Weber, at the University of
Maryland. He developed a detector
essentially consisting of a large alu-
minium bar suspended in a vacuum,
which a gravitational wave would
cause to oscillate almost impercep-
tibly. The method was crude, and the
sensitivity was a few notches below
the target. Although Weber did pub-
lish results claiming detections,
they were never confirmed later
on by more sensitive instruments.
Nevertheless, his work opened up
the whole new possibility of listening
to the sky. “The analogy works rath-
er well. Our ears are able to capture
sounds coming from all directions
without having to turn our heads,
and so does a gravitational wave
detector”, says Danzmann.
Today, state-of-the-art detectors
use high precision lasers to moni-
tor minute shifts in the distance
between two weights located per-
pendicular to each other and free
to move horizontally. An incoming
gravitational wave will cause them
to move a subatomic distance with
respect to one another. They are
kept in rooms whose atmosphere is
cleaner than in hospital surgeries
and inside the world’s largest vac-
uum systems to ensure that stray
gas molecules will not affect the
measurements.
The USA spent $365m over the
last six years building two kilome-
tre-sized detectors in Louisiana and
Washington called LIGO (Laser
Interferometery Gravitational Wave
Observatory). They have been look-
ing for gravitational waves since
1999 and will soon be joined by two
other detectors in Europe: GEO600
(Germany) and VIRGO (Italy).
Recently, a flurry of activity was
reported in the Louisiana LIGO
detector, but the hurricane Katrina
is not exactly a gravitational wave.
Two events within a short period of
time on different facilities either in
the USA or Europe will be required
to confirm a clear detection because
of spurious local effects that can
affect the detectors such as torna-
does or earthquakes.
Once these waves are detected
astronomers hope to be listening
to a part of the universe they know
very little about. “The part of the
universe that is radiating gravita-
tional waves is complementary to
the one that is emitting light. All we
know about the universe we know
from light, electromagnetic waves,
where matter is diluted and mov-
ing slowly. Gravitational waves are
emitted in regions where matter
is extremely dense and moving at
near-light speeds, and that’s a part
of the universe that is not emitting
light,” says Danzmann.
The confirmation of one of
Einstein’s predictions may well lead
to the discovery of another. Black
holes haven’t been detected yet
because they emit no light; how-
ever, they can be rather boister-
ous emitters of gravitational waves.
Also, gravitational waves have the
advantage of not being absorbed like
electromagnetic radiation. That will
allow astronomers to look further
into the past, beyond an era when
the universe was so dense that no
light from back then ever reached
us. “With gravitational waves the
universe is completely transparent,
so in principle we will be able to look
straight into the Big Bang”, says
Danzmann.
And of course, there’s the stuff
we don’t know about. “We will really
only know about sources of gravi-
tational waves from gravitational
waves, so who knows?”
The optimism is such that scien-
tists have already set their eyes, or
better ears, on the future. The US
Presidential budget to congress for
2008 has already commissioned an
update of the LIGO facilities for 15
times more sensitivity – a fit that not
even the Hubble telescope achieved
– in a project called Advanced LIGO.
And then in 2013 the gravitational
wave detectors will be taken off to
space on a mission called LISA.
LISA’s sensitivity will be so large
that the problem then will be dis-
cerning gravitational wave sources
from each other.
By then, no matter what the out-
come, there will be a detection. “By
the time we reach Advanced LIGO, if
we don’t detect anything, then we’ll
start wondering whether there’s
something wrong with our ideas.
And if LISA doesn’t detect gravita-
tional waves, that’s a detection in
itself. It will clearly mean there’s
something wrong with our models of
the universe,” says Danzmann.

A
lthough they work in the
night hours, astrono-
mers crave for a little
light from distant stars
to learn about the uni-
verse. That dependency is coming
to an end. “For centuries we have
been building better telescopes to
look at the sky, but it’s time we
listen to it as well,” says Karsten
Danzmann, director of the Max
Planck Institute for Gravitational
Physics in Hannover. He believes
the discovery of a new form of radia-
tion – gravitational waves – is immi-
nent.
Gravitational waves are a predic-
tion of Einstein’s 90-year-old theory
of gravity. Unlike electromagnetic
waves, which travel through the
medium of space-time, gravitational
waves are a distortion of space-
time itself, a possibility that even
Einstein didn’t believe.
Astronomers are more trustful
of Einstein’s equations these days.
“Although there is still no direct
evidence, no one really doubts that
gravitational waves exist,” says
Danzmann. The first indirect evi-
dence for gravitational waves came
in 1973 from two astronomers in
Princeton, Russell Hulse and
Joseph Taylor. They made obser-
vations of a pair of neutron stars
revolving around each other in
short and fast orbits and were able
to confirm that they were losing
energy at exactly the same rate as
predicted from gravitational waves.
The significance of their discovery
was awarded with a Nobel prize 20
years later.
However, direct evidence will
require more than just telescopes.
“If you look at a massive star explod-
ing somewhere in our vicinity, not
too far away but also not too close,
the resulting gravitational waves
will squeeze space by one part in
1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. This
means that our detector of 1 km
would be squeezed by 1/1000 of the
proton diameter. And that unfortu-
nately only takes a few milliseconds.
So you really have to listen rather
closely,” says Danzmann.
The stringent requirement for
sensitivity explains why scientists
are only just now getting optimistic
about the possibility of detecting
this novel type of radiation. The
enterprise started in the sixties with
“‘For centuries we have
been building better
telescopes to look at
the sky, but it’s time we
listen to it as well,’ says
Karsten Danzmann.”
“Recently, a flurry of
activity was reported in
the Louisiana detector,
but the hurricane
Katrina is not exactly a
gravitational wave.”

New TB test scoops top
prize at Medical Futures
competition
The launch of the European
An inexpensive and rapid test
for tuberculosis (TB) which
could be used in developing
countries has won first place in
the Best Innovation to Improve
Global Healthcare category of
the Medical Futures Innovation

overall prize at the awards
ceremony held last week in
London.
Dr David Moore, from
Imperial College London, and
the winner of the Award said:
“This test can be carried out
using cheap and readily availa-
ble tools and requires relatively
little training or expertise.
This is particularly important
in developing countries which
may not have the infrastruc-
ture we take for granted in the
developed world.”
Imperial academics win
Leverhulme prizes
Dr Molly Stevens, a Reader in
the Department of Materials,
and Dr Sebastian Uchitel, a
Lecturer in the Department
of Computing, have each been
awarded Philip Leverhulme
prizes worth £50,000.
Dr Stevens’s team has been
able to engineer large quanti-
ties of bone, using a novel
approach which uses the
body as a “bioreactor”. The
researchers hope this method
could be used to generate new
bone for transplantation into
patients.
Dr Uchitel’s work addresses
the problems associated with
designing large-scale com-
plex software systems. His
approach to the problem uses
automated techniques for both
building and analysing models
in an incremental manner, to
provide a powerful design tool.
