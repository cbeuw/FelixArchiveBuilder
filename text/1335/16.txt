I don’t remember school
being like this
These are her breasts give them respect. Next week: another body part
I think I should apologise to all of
the people I molested, shouted at,
spilt snake bite on, need I continue
the list is endless. I really would not
recommend drinking cider before
going to a night at the Union, espe-
cially when you are not paying for
the booze. It only ends in what I
can describe as wrongness of the
wrongest wrong wrong wronginess
(and I yes I know I just made those
words up).
I’ll get the review bit over with
then I will tell you my tale of woe.
The evening started out very quiet.
If it was a small pet or a sickly child
you would have had it put down;
it looked very pathetic. The main
lights were all on and all the scarey
sci-fi and calculator lovers were still
in the Union. Where do these sci-fi
freaks come from? Is it wrong to
call them freaks? I’m never too sure
with minorities these days, there
are so many laws. OK, I’ll refer to
them from here on out as the creepy
sociallychallengedpeople.Theygen-
erally are attached to some cult as
well, like Christianity or some other
thing where they make you pray
en mass (I’m going to hell anyway
so I might as well have an express
ticket). You know it was everything
you expect a night at Imperial Union
to be (there we go back on track).
As the evening progressed and we
The angry troll
First off, I think it’s necessary to say
that no, I am not a retard, just a little
special and I know I can’t spell. In
fact I bet a retard special child would
have better grammar and spelling
than me. I think however that you
would agree that getting free bears
from the bman at the corner shop
has quite a nice ring to it.
In this week’s Nightlife we have
another extract from our buxom bar
wench and a review of the incred-
ibly brutal and debauched School
Daze at the Union. I have several
things to say first. I would like to
blame Malcolm, the ents manager
at the Union, for me phoning most
of the friends in my phone book at
3am Saturday morning telling them,
“I have no shoes. Ooh they’re next
to me” while in the South Ken tube
station. I don’t think all the people
waiting for the bus enjoyed my ren-
dition of “Where are my shoes?”
either. Malcolm you have a lot to pay
for. You’re a very naughty man.
Again I continue my midget plea.
I’m yet to receive any pictures or
stories of the little people. Please,
please, please send them to me. If
you’re a little person yourself I want
to hear from you and I have a very
special job for you.

The wench returns
The union has been infected! Call
rent-a-kill! Put out the traps! The
Americans have arrived! I’m sorry;
I know you Imperial guys rejoice
when that nasal twang is heard
because you feel like you’re living in
a sex-less, girl-less, frenzied hell.
You’re convinced your palms will
go hairy tomorrow cause the only
girl you’ve seen for the past week
has a mono-brow and a funny eye;
but seriously guys, an American?
I’m sure lots of them are very attrac-
tive, lovely people, but when you
hear: “Oh my gaard! Caan I get
anutha snaykebite?” In a pitch not
even dogs could detect, for the 59th
time, you just want to cut your arms
off so you don’t have to serve them
any more.
Although, I’ve got to confess, I did
get highly excited when told I was
working whilst an American society
had a Halloween karaoke party. I
hadn’t laughed quite as much for
a long time. Well, I think hysteri-
cal is a more fitting description. I
didn’t know whether to laugh or cry
in embarrassment. They have no
shame, just obnoxious arrogance or
extreme insecurity channelled into
an overcompensating ego.
There was this whale of a girl, who
not only had a voice like a group of
small children being run over by a
double-decker, but was also as irri-
tating as an STI on a hot day. By the
end of the night all I wanted to do
was throw her to a pack of ravenous
rottweilers. Well, there was enough
meat on her. It was like looking at a
pig in a girdle
In conclusion, if you want to pull
a Yank, then the Union is the place
to be right now. Something along
the lines of, “If you want a wank
pull a Yank”. Just don’t wear your
best clothes; god knows they don’t.
I’ve heard snakebite puke is hard
to get out.
The Bar Wench
“Has a mono-brow
and a funny eye”
all drank more alcohol it started
filling up with some quite attractive
girls. All of my friends I brought
with me were hot so they weren’t
being counted but there were girls
in mini skirts and everything, and
their cleavages were everywhere.
I have to say by 10pm the down-
ward spiral of debauchery had
begun. By this point I had already
turned to my friend Trish and asked
her to, “Spank me like a pony!”,
and tried to take various pictures of
my friends boobs, knickers and any-
thing else I could get hold of.
The foam was the best idea the
Union’s ever had. It’s great; you get
wet and grope each other, which I
did quite a lot. What more can you
want from a Friday night? In fact I
did spank a girl for being very rude
to me. When a load of us go out we
do tend to dominate most of every-
thing, and Friday was no exception.
I guess I should really do a little
review. The music was of a quite
high standard of cheese and party
fun-ness. Everyone was in high spir-
its and I think most people would
have had to have been poured into
bed when they got home. There
were guys in skirts as well. Friday
night proved a lot to me. It showed
that you don’t need a lot of people to
have fun, just foam. I wonder if you
could end wars with it. It would be
like come on one people, put down
your guns and lets play in the foam.
I feel I should inform you of the
morning after, as it was one of my
worst hangovers to date. The phone
call with Chloe was very entertain-
ing, it began “Urgggggggggggghhh
mutha fucker!!”. I came to the con-
clusion then that, yes, Aaron was
still very wasted and should not
get out of bed. I wasn’t the worst
off by far. My flat mate woke up
in Peckham at 4.30am after having
fallen asleep on the night bus, nice.
Oh and I think we should apologise
to the poor blind person who is miss-
ing a white stick after Friday.
