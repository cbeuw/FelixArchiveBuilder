ries”. “We welcome the recognition
of nuclear facilities as a terrorist
target. However the bill has implica-
tions for peaceful protestors,” stated
CND in a press statement.
There were also concerns about
the vagueness of the new penalty
outlawing the ‘glorification’ of ter-
rorism, which was passed last week
with a majority of one. As well as
the concerns that “One man’s free-
dom fighter is another man’s terror-
ist” (and as a result, supporters of
Nelson Mandela would be arrested
for glorifying his ‘terrorist activi-
ties’), more concerned MP’s, such
as Lembit Öpik, tabled an early day
motion pointing out that the celebra-
tion of Guy Fawkes night would be
‘glorifying’ terrorism, and as a result
would be banned (a point made all
the more ironic by the fact that the
house is holding a exhibition about
Guy Fawkes this month), and the
danger of preaching double stand-
ards. Lembit has been particularly
scathing of the new bill, claiming
that the ‘internment’ plans of the
government damaged attempts at
creating a peace agreement during
the troubles in Northern Ireland,
and that it would create the same
trouble if applied now.
As the amendment was being dis-
cussed in the Lords, it was over-
whelmingly supported, with the only
concerns raised being over silly mat-
ters, such as whether gay people
will sue the NHS for discrimination
if they are refused treatment.
After the amendment was passed
Alon told Felix, “I am delighted that
the government has come around to
support amending the Equality Bill.
This is a big victory for everyone
who campaigned to outlaw this dis-
crimination. Together with pressure
from trade unions, Stonewall and
many other groups and individuals,
we have managed to get the govern-
ment to see sense and outlaw homo-
phobic discrimination now.”
Imperial student’s
victory on gay rights
Whilst all this feverish discussion
was taking place, over in the House
of Lords Imperial student Alon Or-
Bach was celebrating after “one of
the quietest government U-turns”
was passed due to campaigning from
the Labour campaign for Lesbain
and Gay Rights (LCLGR).
Alon, who is the co-chair of the
LCLGR, helped campaign during
the Labour party conference earlier
this year to make discrimination on
the grounds of sexual orientation
an offence, which attained a 100%
vote at the conference in favour of
amending the Equality Bill.
T
he 9th of November saw a
mass of debate and argu-
ment that saw the age old
House of Commons as a
witness to one of the most
passionate battles to have occurred
in recent times, namely the argu-
ment over the government’s new
terrorism bill and more specifically
whether to pass the amendment
to allow terrorist suspects to be
detained for 90 days without charge.
Unless you’ve been living under a
rock for the past week you would
have undoubtedly known that this
was rejected; the first time the
Government has lost a ‘whipped
vote’, where Labour ministers were
told how they should vote. Although
this has been pounced on as a
moment where Tony Blair has lost
power, this is not the complete story,
or far from the end of the matter.
Although some civil right cam-
paigners might be popping cham-
pagne corks over the government’s
defeat, there are still many points
of the new bill to boil their blood.
Outside the Houses of Parliament
there was a rally by various civil
rights groups, including CND,
Liberty and Amnesty amongst many
others, lobbying against several
aspects of the bill. CND themselves
were concerned that the new bill
would be used to clamp down on
peaceful protest on nuclear facili-
ties, as a clause in the new terrorism
bill will make trespass on a nuclear
site an offence, “including the area
around the…fences and bounda-
Judgement day for Tony Blair

Nearly 50 Labour MPs rebel to force the ﬁrst Labour defeat in a ‘whipped vote’

Despite controversey, other terror proposals still pass.
In the Lords, a quiet U-turn as Imperial student’s campaign passes through.
Debate came to a

Matthew Hartfield

These points, along with the 90-day
detention plan, caused some fever-
ish debate in the house, which came
to a head during the prime minis-
ter’s questions as Conservative MP
Charles Walker shouted “We are not
a police state” towards Tony Blair.
“We are not living in a police state,
but we are living in a country that
faces a real and serious threat of
terrorism; terrorism that wants to
destroy our way of life; terrorism
that wants to inflict casualties on us
without limit” replied an obviously
seething prime minister.
When you consider all these hur-
dles, the fact that only the 90-day
detention amendment was rejected
by the government, with the 28-
day detention amendment passed
straight afterwards (which gives
the UK some of the longest deten-
tion time in the world; the US can
only hold suspects for 7 days before
charging or releasing them) makes
this appear (albiet not obviously) as
an overall success for the Labour
government, with the bare bones
of their bill passing through the
commons successfully. With the
first defeat in their eight-year reign
occurring though, it is clear Tony
Blair no longer has the stranglehold
over the commons he once had,
and indeed this will cause problems
when passing through the raft of
reforms he has got lined up on edu-
cation and other public services.
It looks as if, however, he still has
enough power to run the govern-
ment for now, with it looking likely
that he will still serve out a full third
term without facing a major revolt,
with a vote of no confidence looking
extremly unlikely.

After his defeat last Wednesday, Tony Blair labelled some of his MP’s
as being “out of touch”
he ﬁght against the HIV epidemic
D
escribed by the UN
Security Council as the
fastest growing threat
to human develop-
ment, responsible for
8000 deaths each day and currently
infecting 40 million people world-
wide, the global AIDS pandemic is
not something we can choose to
ignore. Nor can it be argued that
it is being ignored; on the contrary,
the past twenty years have seen
phenomenal advances in pharma-
ceuticals such that HIV sufferers
in the West are now living longer
than could ever have been expected.
The area in which we have not seen
advances is that of universal access
to treatment.
95% of those living with HIV live
in the developing world. Only 15%
of those in need of treatment have
access to antiretroviral drugs. With
the vast majority of new infections
occurring in those of working age,
HIV is having a dramatic impact
on the economic productivity and
social structure of many nations. It
is predicted that the pandemic will
be responsible for the reversal of
many of the development gains that
have been made over the past 50
years in some of the worst affected
countries.
So what is being done? The pan-
demic has not escaped the atten-
tion of the global community. In
fact, it has led to the formation of
a number of high profile initiatives.
The Millennium Development Goals
include “the halt and reversal of
the spread of HIV by 2015”, as one
of their targets; the WHO has been
pushing for greater access to drugs
through its ‘3 by 5’ campaign, aiming
to get 3 million people onto treat-
ment by the year 2005. The Global
Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria
has been set up as a financing mech-
anism to offer financial support to
the fight, and President Bush has
sent up his own body, the President’s
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief
(PEPFAR). Most recently we have
seen the pledge made by G8 leaders
to ensure universal access to treat-
ment by the year 2010.
What must however be questioned
is what impact these initiatives can
have. Criticised from the outset for
targeting the easy to reach rather
than those who were in greatest
need, the ‘3 by 5’ initiative is almost
certain to fail by the end of the year,
as by June 2005 only one third of
its target was receiving treatment.
President Bush’s pledge to fight
HIV and AIDS may win him votes,
but the reality is that the restric-
tions placed on spending are likely to
negate much of the perceived good.
One third must be used to promote
abstinence and condoms can only be
offered to groups considered ‘high
risk’. This blind approach ignores
important details, such as that a
huge proportion of new infections
are occurring amongst married
women, for whom ‘being faithful’
is clearly not sufficient protection.
Furthermore, PEPFAR funding can
only be used to buy patented drugs,
which results in four times fewer
people being treated than if generic
drugs were purchased.
In addition, it must be acknowl-
edged that irrespective of the fail-
ures of individual initiatives, the HIV
pandemic is not something that can
be tackled independently of other
development issues. While many
countries’ debt repayments continue
to be more than double that which
they receive in aid; while there are
no effective measures to help pre-
vent the continuous migration of
health care workers to the north;
and while the global trading system
continues to unfairly discriminate
against poorer nations, the forma-
tion of new initiatives are unlikely to
truly halt the HIV pandemic.
