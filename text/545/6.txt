RESULTS O F ICWA
QUESTIONNAIRE
As a result of the last ICWA general
meeting a questionnaire was given to all
women in college and 201 replies were
received. 118 of these women felt they
got enough entertainment at college'
although only 60 took part in any C C U
activities. The only reason given for not
participating was that C C U activities
were childish and aimed at males. Over
half of the replies were received from
women not in college accomodation
and 18 of these said they felt the need of
extra contact with other women.
60 women had previously attended
ICWA functions and of those who had
not the majority cited lack of publicity,
money or time as their reason for not
attending.
Bad publicity for ICWA functions and
amenities does appear to be a
considerable problem; 28 women did
not know where the ICWA lounge is
situated and 130 women were unaware
of all the amenities available to them
e.g.coffee, newspapers, typewriter.
83 women said they would be willing
to participate in new ICWA events like
theatre trips, courses, squash ladders if
they were organised and 43 women said
they would be willing to help organise.
There was a great deal of confusion
over the difference between WIST (a
feminist group) and ICWA with 103
women not aware of the difference. In a
space left for additional comments
replies included 'uses ICWA to express
feminist views', 'ICWA is a form of
sexual discrimination and does little to
further the cause of women at IC, 'Now
that women are allowed in bars there is
no need for a women's lounge.'
Also 'Disband ICWA and incorporate
WIST with G A Y S O C . Stop wasting
paper and my time', 'Some of the women
presently involved in ICWA are
obsessed with men being dominant',
'men-hating sexist organisation'.
The most obvious results from the
anti-ICWA comments showed women
were unaware of the meaning of
feminism and a desire to prevent any
feminists taking an active position in
ICWA
Amongst the comments in favour of
ICWA there were 'women at IC are
oppressed', 'I do think ICWA is a
valuable institution','! feel it serves a
purpose', 'There is a need for such a
non-feminist women's group in such a
male dominated college',Td like to see
ICWA propitiated in college. I wasn't
aware of the amenities available in the
ICWA lounge but shall henceforth
endeavour to take advantage of them',
'It maybe another superfluous society
but why not have such a nice
superfluous society'.
Taking the comments as a whole 60
women were generally in favour of the
continuation of ICWA, 50 were against
and the remainder did not express any
opinion. Can the needs of these 60
women be ignored?
Debbie James
FELIX acting Editor writes;
The interpretation of the replies to the
questionnaire was hotly disputed at the
last Union General Meeting.
