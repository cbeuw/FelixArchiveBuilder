Moysey faced seemingly insuperable
odds. One of the four entrants was a
T h a m e s T r a d e s m a n E l i t e s c u l l e r
(representing the Royal Agricultural
College). In the first race Pete led
from the start but was pushed all the
way beating his Reading opponent by
1 V 2 lengths. He now had the Elite
sculler in the final. Despite being a
length down for most of the course his
perserverance was rewarded when his
opponent faded in the home straight
and Pete sprinted through to win by
six or seven lengths.
Our extremely capable ladies crew
were unfortunate enough to draw the
Cambridge University Womens first
eight (the female equivalent of the
C a m b r i d g e B l u e Boat) in the first
round. Despite IC's aggressive rowing,
Cambridge won easily and we had
only the consolation that Cambridge
destroyed all the other crews that they
raced in the competition. It seems
unfair that C U W B C was allowed to
enter when neither of the Blue boats
were allowed to, it would have been a
better competition without them.
Our freshers novice eight lacked the
fitness and experience of the Oxbridge
c r e w s w h o row six d a y s a w e e k .
C o n s e q u e n t l y they lost by a few
. lengths to St Peters College, Oxford.

most of which were suitably wetted
that night. E v e r y o n e who e n t e r e d

perhaps for the fact that the boat-

IC WIN SOUTHERN
UNIVERSITIES REGATTA FOR
SEVENTH YEAR RUNNING
The men's senior squad had a clean
s w e e p at R e a d i n g last S a t u r d a y
winning the Championship Eights, the
second eights and the Championship
Sculling.
T h e first eight d i s p o s e d of two
Cambridge colleges, Emmanuel and
Churchill, at little more than a firm
paddle and then drew Reading, the
host crew, in the final. This was a
most exciting race in which the eight
came back from 3
/ 4 length down and
coolly' rowed through to win by a V 4
length. This is the seventh consecutive
year that we have won this competition.
The second eight after a tough race
with Oslar (Oxford medical students)
comfortably beat Emmanuel second
e i g h t . In t h e f i n a l t h e y met t h e
defenders, Southampton first eight.
After a disastrous start in this epic
race in which Southampton gained
clear water, our valiant second eight
rowed t h r o u g h them to win by a
length.
In the Championship Sculls Pete

It took IC fourths 195 minutes to
qualify for the final of the cup against
K C H seconds. The first match was a
tense, hard-fought game which could
so easily have gone either way. In the
first half, IC really d o m i n a t e d the
game, pushing forward all the time,
c r e a t i n g s e v e r a l c h a n c e s . A n d y
Hartland scored from one of these and
Damian Nnochiri hit the post with a
powerful shot from the edge of the
area. T h e second half started badly for
IC with K C H pushing forward strongly
through some good work from their
midfield. Their pressure paid off after
about ten minutes with them equalising
with a somewhat clumsy headed goal.
U r g e d o n by this, they started to
dominate, forcing Steve Veats to make
some fine saves and Neil Morris to clear
off the line. However, the defence stood
firm a n d IC, o n c e m o r e , s t a r t e d
controlling the game, hitting the post
and narrowly missing several times.
Extra time had to be played and the
game ended in stalemate.
The replay started much the same as
the first match with a fiercely contested
battle in the midfield, but right from the
onset IC's determination and confid-
ence controlled the play. After five
minutes Paul Galvin nipped in to score
from Andy's flick on and then started
the rout. IC threw themselves into
attack virtually pulverising K C H . Their
keeper made several spectacular saves
before Neil Redmayne got up to a
corner to head in. From the very next
corner a K C H defender had to scoop
the ball off the line from R i c h a r d
Dolan's effort giving a penalty which
was somehow saved by their keeper.
IC started the second half
as furiously as they ended the first.
Paul scored with a neatly taken half.
v o l l e y after two m i n u t e s , q u i c k l y
followed by Andy's first. Andy scored
again soon after having run through
most of their d e f e n c e , and a few
minutes later Quentin was bundled
over in their area for another penalty.
This time Neil Redmayne took a short
run-up (over 25 yards) and slammed it
into the bottom right-hand corner. The
p e r f o r m a n c e was r o u n d e d off by
Damian smashing one in from the
edge of the box and Andy getting his
hat trick. The whole team was superb.
Thanks to super linesman Melvin
and hope to see all of IC. At Motspur
Park on Saturday 15th March for the
final against L S E seconds.

WATER POLO
On Tuesday 12th February, IC had a
couple of games for the U L U League.
IC firsts, playing in the first division,
were the first to play against Guys
Hospital. G u y s opened the score in
the first quarter, but we equalised at
the beginning of the second quarter,
when Phil Thwaites passed the ball to
Barry Ashwin and his shot hit the base
of the post and went in. Guys returned
to the attack and scored another goal,
but B a r r y e q u a l i s e d a g a i n with a
powerful shot from far away out.
However, Guys scored one more by
the end of the third quarter. At the
final quarter, Barry awarded a penalty,
but his shot hit the post and came
out! We kept the pressure on and two
more shots by Nick Last and Adrian
Butler hit the posts! Another shot by
Phil Mills just crossed the goal line,
but the referee thought it didn't and
he didn't count it! Finally, Guys scored
one more goal to make the final score
4-2 to them. The score is rather heavy
for IC, who had a super game and
would have certainly achieved a better
result it they hadn't been so unlucky.
Team: D Roberts, N Buckland, A
Butler, P Mills, N Last, P Thwaites, B
Ashwin.
It was IC 2nds next, playing in the
s e c o n d d i v i s i o n a g a i n s t L o n d o n
H o s p i t a l s e c o n d s . T h e o p p o s i t i o n
started the game very aggressively
and they were 2-0 up by the end of
the s e c o n d q u a r t e r . In the t h i r d
quarter we pulled ourselves together
and we started playing much better.
N i g e l C h a p m a n a n d P h i l S i n c l a i r
stopped LH2 scoring and Bob Bradley
and Colin Butchelor organised our
efforts midpool. Nick Ajderian passed
the ball to Pat Porter and he scored
our first goal. At the beginning of the
final quarter, LH2 had a shot and the
ball stopped on the goal line, but the
referee counted it as a goal, being
under pressure from the L H supporters!
Dimitri Papaconstantinou scored our
second goal, after receiving the ball
from J o h n Heffernon, to make the final
score 3-2 to them.
T e a m : B B r a d l e y , P S i n c l a i r , N
Ajderian, P Porter, J Hefferman, N
Chapman, D Papaconstantinou and C
Butchelor.
We w o u l d have p r o d u c e d better
results, if the referees hadn't been
markedly against us in both games.
Actually, one of them admitted later at
the bar that LH2's shot didn't cross the
goal line!
