OUTLINE O F THE REPORT O F
THE COMMITTEE O F INQUIRY
INTO THE ENGINEERING
PROFESSION
Purpose: T o review the requirements of
British Industry for engineers (profession and
technical) and the satisfaction of those needs;
utilization of engineers; the role of engineering
institutions — and the usefulness of registration
for engineers.
Investigation of British Industry, Engineer-
ing, and National Economic Needs.
The report notes the following problems
(among others): many disappearing industries,
increasing import/export ratio, decreasing
share in world trade, low corporate profits, and
a corporate tendency to neglect exploring
markets before p r o d u c t i o n . Conclusion:
engineers and engineering (the "engineering
dimension") must be better developed and
utilized by industry in order to become more
competitive with high-quality, high value-added
goods.
Engineering Dimension Analysis
1. Engineers lack the status and recognition
afforded them in other countries; low salaries
and poor career prospects accompany the
problem.
2. Corporations are reluctant or unable to
devote m u c h money to developing new
technologies necessary for competition (ie a
starved engineering dimension).
3. Firms do not utilise engineers talents fully:
most aren't advanced into upper management,
lack of recognition for successes and failures,
innovation not encouraged.
4. T h e engineers dimension must include
market analysis and interaction; it is not
detached from sales.
5. Supply of engineers is probably less than
demand; shortage of technicians (engineers
deployed as technicians); severe shortage of
the well-qualified.
The main recommendations are:
1. There should be an Engineering Authority,
set up by statute and funded by Government.
It would have about twenty members, most of
them being engineers, and would promote and
strengthen engineering within the British
industry and economy. The present Engineers'
Registration Board would be abolished and
engineers would be registered through the
Authority.
2. Registration would be voluntary but,
hopefully, industry will take the lead by making
it, "in effect, a licence to practice". A new code
of practice would be drawn up, a a breach of
which may led to deregistration.
3. There should be a three route course (to
combat status problems and the previously
mentioned problems; introduces training with a
"synthesis of technical, human, and financial
consideration" and the development of wider
skills).
The totally new three-tier structure would be
introduced based on academic courses but
but requiring a programme of structure
postgraduate training and experience. The three
tiers of registration are:
1. Registered Engineer (Diploma) R Eng (Dip)
A four year undergraduate course leading to M
Eng followed by two years in industry gaining
experience. For top 25% of engineers, (those
showing "early potential for leadership in the
development of advanced technology or in the
management of engineering operations").
2. Registered Engineers R Eng
A three to three and a half year undergraduate
course based on B Eng degree with appropriate
postgraduate training and experience lasting
two years. This course is slightly more basic
and geared more towards preparation for
mainstream engineering work.
3. Registered Engineer (Associate) R Eng
(Assoc)
This would be mainly part-time and sandwich,
with H E D sandwich and structured working
experience leading to registration in five years.
This would be for supportive roles in industry.
The whole system would have many opportu-
nities for transfer a n d present engineers
would be registered in relation to the structure.
There is a proposal for an extra £250 incentive
grant per year for B Eng/M Eng students.
4. Regional centres funded by the Engineering
Authority should be set up to promote training.
Engineers should have a statutory right to paid
leave for study.
5. The Authority should initiate a programme
to promote the importance of engineers in
i n d u s t r y e s p c i a l l y a i m e d at e m p l o y e r s .
Employers should review career and salary
structures to improve incentives and should
support the training of young graduates. There
should be more exchanges between enginners
in industry and engineering teachers in order
that engineers can impart more knowledge to
the students and that teachers can keep up to
date with developments in industry.
6. Schools should keep options open as long as
possible so that more students may be
encouraged to enter engineering; mathematics
and physics should be taught to the age of
sixteen or later. More careers information
should be provided to encourage students to
go into engineering.
Overall, the Report emphasises that British
Industry is declining and in order to regain a
position in the international market, better
quality goods, particularly manufacturing
goods, must be produced. This can only occur
if more engineers are produced. The future
engineer should have a commitment to
innovation and production and should have a
greater s o c i a l s t a n d i n g . T h e quality of
engineers and engineering teachers should be
improved in industry, and there should be
greater access to research and a greater
implementation of ideas and new develop-
ments.
