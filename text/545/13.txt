Abortion and V . D . is the title of the third in our series
made in conjunction with the Family Planning
Association, which is especially aimed at students; you
can hear it on Monday night at 11pm.
F o c u s on A l S t e w a r t - S u n d a y 5.00pm In Britain
he's a "One-hit wonder" folk singer. In America he's the
successful singer - songwriter who has become a point of
musical attention with critically and commercially
acclaimed albums that deftly combine the best elements
of folk, rock, and lyrical poetry to very good effect.
This Sunday's Focus brings into view both the man
and the music. It seeks the source of his inspiration and
looks at the numerous people that he has worked with,
from the early years of the late 60's folk scene, where he
made quite a reputable name for himself, to more recent
times, where he has enjoyed the success of albums such
as " Y e a r of the C a t " and " T i m e Passages".
The programme follows A l Stewart's musical career
and will include tracks from all eight of his albums,
offering a rare opportunity to hear the progression in
music and refinement of songwriting, that took him
fifteen years.

The Brighton Connection . . . or
How to make a Radio Programme
from a Shoebox
It is a (little known) fact that, next to a towel, a
shoebox is the most massively useful article that the
Galactic Hitch-hiker and radio presenter can carry with
him. W h e n not being converted for use as a shelter from
atomic fallout, o r reconfigured as an easy-play piano to
while away the hours, it can be hastily re-arranged as a
drinks machine. Not surprisingly, the art of shoebox
conversion (or 'Advanced Footwear Receptable
Utilisation* as it is known in the trendier parts of the
Galaxy) is one which is m u c h sought after by the acolytes
of true box-husbandry.
Now, for the first time, the age-old secrets of the trade
are presented for one and all, as told by Marjac the lO^th,
the reptilian master of shoebox manipulation from the
planet Box IL T u n e in to the S & M show at 11 o n
Sunday mornings, and, armed with your trusty shoebox,
experience the thrill of creation as the shoebox is
transformed beneath your hands into a telephone box, a
scale model of Margaret Thatcher, a combine harvester -
let your imagination run riot . . .
All this in the salubrious aural surroundings of the
S & M Show, with the 'Magic Roundabout', the Radio
Vet, and so m u c h more. Miss it at your peril.
Simon Milner (the one and only)
P.S. Imperial College Radio can fake no responsibility for
death, wounding or other misfortune sustained whilst
wielding shoeboxes.
I Live in Stan's This Sunday between
8.30 and 11pm Sarah Talbot and Harvey Nadin
will be broadcasting live from Stan's Bar.
Come and join in the fun.

This is also a n excellent way for the
chairman to get paralytic. Intrepid Radio
Society drunkards will meet in Stan's B a r
at 7:00pm o n February 27th complete
with two-metre transeivers if they've got
them (or not, if they haven't). T h e n the
fun starts. Russell, the B i g Boss, will
conceal himself in a pub within reasonable
walking distance and we have to find him
by asking (over the air) simple yes o r n o
questions. If y o u think y o u might be
interested in H a m s o c , w h y not come
along? The 'competition' is for groups of
people, with one transmitting amateur per
group.

O n the night we will meet in the 'Chelsea

IC TENPIN BOWLING CLUB
On Sunday Bowling Club sent two
teams to Portsmouth to compete in
the P o r t s m o u t h Q u a d s t o u r n a m e n t
(four man teams).
After a brush with the Law, involving
invisible no-entry signs, the A learn
got to Portsmouth to find the B team
already there and the lanes in good
condition.
Six games later the A team had
finsihed with a d i s a p p o i n t i n g total
(only two players, Ray Cook and Brian
MacGowan bowled above average).
H o w e v e r t h e B t e a m , l e d by t h e
brilliant bowling of Tubby W o o and
Joe N g , had already won the tourn-
ament. T h e high point of their play
was an exceptional 821 four-man team
game with Tubby scoring 256 (the
best bowled in the day) and 242 from
Joe. Tubby took most of the personal
prizes a n d the most important, the
t o u r n a m e n t t r o p h y , will g o in the
Union Office with the one Edmond
and Tubby won for the Club at the
Brunei University Doubles Tournament
last month at the Heathrow Airport
Bowl.
We still have r o o m f o r a n y o n e
interested in bowling in our Wednesday
afternoon sessions at Tolworth, Surrey,
leaving the e n t r a n c e to A e r o E n g
(opposite Beit Archway) at 2:30pm.
A Team: John Knight, Ray Cook, Tim
Hillyer, and Brian MacGowan.
B Team: Tubby Woo, Edmond N g ,
Albert Wong and Joe Ng.
Thanks to everyone for bowling and to
Tim for getting us there (despite 'non-
endorsable' delays).

DEBATING SOCIETY
This house believes that ICWA
serves a useful purpose
A captive, though due to the large size of
the r o o m , not a n overflowing a u d i e n c e ,
attended the s e c o n d in a series of weekly
d e b a t e s b e i n g h e l d b y t h e s o c i e t y . T h e
speakers on this occasion were Gwen Griffiths
and Mike Brown.
G w e n , who was p r o p o s i n g the m o t i o n ,
claimed that to abolish I C W A would be a
negative approach to the problems of the
association, and although very little is presently
being achieved, a change in the constitution
would enable members to enjoy more benefits
that t h e a s s o c i a t i o n c o u l d p r o v i d e . In
opposition to this, Mike put forward his view
that I C W A had once served a useful function
(when women first came to IC) but now this
purpose had disappered and I C W A is no
longer able to communicate with its members.
T h e motion was eventually defeated by a
convincing majority.
Hopefully, future debates will be o n the
legalisation of c a n n a b i s , a n d e u t h a n a s i a ,
publicity will be given at a later date. Everyone
is welcome, and if you would like to speak
please contact me, via my departmental letter
rack.
