PANCAKE RACE
Last Tuesday saw the annual
I C W A Pancake Race in the Beit
Archway, which just happened
to clash, yet again, with the
testing of the fire hoses.
Again six women challenged
our heroic I C U Executive to six
laps of the Quad. With frying
pans in hand, watched on by
three hundred, the race started
just after 1:00pm. It was a close
race, which the Exec won by one
short I C W A member's head.
Aferwards the teams dried off
and enjoyed pancakes.
The pictures show the team
members under attack. N o effect
was spared to inflict maximum
havoc. At intervals around the
course fire hose testers squirted
the runners at close distance
with dustbinloads added for
extra effect.
Lastly the match was refereed
by the Union Adminstrator, Jen
Hardy-Smith, who replaced, at
short, notice, the hospital-bound
Colin Palmer.
EGM
The Great Hall on Tuesday
lunchtime will be the scene of the
UGM. Again IC's relationship to the
NUS will be discussed A motion
proposed calls for a referendum, the
only way ICU can reaffiHate. If the
motion is passed this would be at the
same time as the sabbatical elections,
ie Monday 10th and Tuesday 11th
March.
THE DEBATE LIVES O N
After an action-packed forty
minutes of intense intellectual
combat, the house finally voted on
the motion "This house believes
the Americans landing on the
moon was an afront to lunar
rights". After numerous references
to 'Lunarians', T h e United Planets
Universal Declaration on the Rights
of AD Beings' (UPUDRAB) and the
'Hen Gets O n e (Stone Henge)
Gravity Transmit Beam' the motion
was finally passed convincingly.

NEW ULU PRESIDENT
Nominations for next year's
University of London Union Presi-
dent closed on Wednesday with
only one candidate standing.
As a result of this, it now looks
certain that A n n a C l a r k , the
current President of Westfield
College, will be the sabbatical
President of U L U for the 1980/81
session.
TWENTY-FOUR HOUR
IRONING
To raise money for their tour to
Amsterdam members of Rag and
IC Rugby Club organised a twenty-
four hour ironing session. Visitors
to the Union Concert Hall were
suprised to see hefty blokes leaning
iron in hands, dealing with the
problems of 36B bras, shirts and
curtains.
On Wednesday night, nearly half
way through the ordeal FELIX
asked Steve Gunn if anything
remarkable had happened. He
replied that there had been a pink
jump suit which changed shades of
pink on ironing. Also he told how
Adam Warby had spilt Swan all
over an unfortunate person's
trousers.
A delivery service was organised
to collect clothes from the halls
and houses. FELIX was told by
Steve Townsend, team captain,
that £300 was expected to be
raised.
STOIC
This week STOIC celebrated its
tenth birthday, with two special
programmes.
SOUTHSIDE SHOP
The turnover in the Southside
Shop has gone up by 40%. This
follows the introduction of more
lines, at more competitive prices
and in more economic quantities.
Pies and pasties are now on sale as
well as frozen lines. Next week
wine will also be on sale.
WEEKEND REFECTORY
; ARRANGEMENTS
Mr Mooney, refectory manager,
told FELIX that the numbers using
the refectory services at the
weekend have continually decreased
until it has now reached a point
where it is no longer an economic
outlet. To counteract this drain and
to reduce our losses it is proposed to
take the following steps:
1. Reduce the prices of the food
served for the weekend only.
2. Cut the number of staff to a
minimum which, while it may mean
the customers wait a little longer, will
save in the region of £25 per day.
3. Readjust the menu in the light of
current demand.
From the menus it will be noted
that the prices have been reduced
between ten and fifteen percent.
R C S U Piano missing
Any information on its whereabouts
will be gratefully received by the
RCSU president, Sean O'Boyle.
Colin Palmer is in hospital, so I have coordinated the
production of this week's FELIX. I've enjoyed it immensely,
but must thank all those who rallied round: Mark Smith, Ian,
Maz, Tim Hiflyer, Mary Freeman, Lars Wernberg-Medler,
Jeremy Nunns and IC Radio for some of the news.
I hope youenjoy readingthisweek's FELIX and willwant to
contribute to future editions.
Now I must return to my job as Secretaryrthe challenge
over.
