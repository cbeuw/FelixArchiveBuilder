N E W S IN BRIEF
FELIX FELLAH FALLS
FRACTURING FOOT
FIASCO
Thursday 19th February, London:
Today at 12:30pm, FELIX Editor,
C o l i n P a l m e r , while heroically
chasing a police car in search of
news, fell and severely fractured
(and dislocated) his foot.
After a cursory inspection at the
health centre, Colin was rushed by
ambulance to St Stephens's hospital.
A doctor there rapidly diagnosed
the trouble and sent him up to the
X-ray unit. (Mild concussion was
also suspected, but later discounted
when the hospital staff discovered
that he always acts that way.)
This first set of X-rays however,
puzzled the radiographer and a
second set had to be taken. Even
then the problem was not solved and
a specialist had to be called in. It was
at this point that Colin realised to
quote: "It's not just a sprained ankle!"
Doctors then decided that the
fracture would have to be mani-
pulated and an operating theatre was
swiftly made ready. In preparation a
local anaesthetic was administered in
conjunction with a tourniquet above
the knee. All the while, Colin was
taking d o z e n s of pictures . . .
selflessly thinking of news for FELIX.
After major surgery had been
completed, a few more X-rays were
taken for the hospital a r c h i v e s
because of the 'unusual' nature of the
injury. It turned out that Colin's
fracture approximated to a Les
Franc fracture, a common discom-
fiture during the Napoleonic wars,
when soldiers frequently had gun
carriages ride over their feet.
Colin will have to stay in hospital
for 48-72 hours until the swelling has
subsided. Then he will be in Dlaster
for between six to eight weeks and
will also be on crutches.

JEZEBEL GOES TO THE
PARK
The finish of the Pancake Race
did not see the end of the wetness.
A heavy overloaded 1916 Dennis
fire engine (Jez to her chums) sped
to the site of an a l l e g e d fire.
Bravely ignoring the 'No Unauthor-
ised E n t r a n c e " signs, she was
brought to rest on the far side of
the Serpentine. After a brief hiatus,
the fire fighting equipment was run
out, the suction hose placed in the
' S e r p ' a n d d u c k s , d r a k e s a n d
rowing boats were soon scattered
by salvoes from the newly restored
p u m p . A c r o w d g a t h e r e d a n d
the police kept their d i s t a n c e
seemingly in silent admiration.
It was only as things were being
packed up that a representative of
'the establishment' stopped by,
saying it was O K by him but please
ask next time.
There was also a false alarm in
I he vicinity of The Queens. Later
that day a fire engine called by to
investigate.

taken last Saturday, outside
Harrods, on the RCSU rag
event. A report appears on page

£140 was raised.
OVERSEAS STUDENTS
WEEK
A voluntary service overseas on
Monday night followed by a discus-
sion heralded the start of Overseas
Student W e e k at Imperial. T h e
d e b a t e o n T u e s d a y a b o u t the
motion "This House believes that
Western nations hinder the progress
of the developing nations" was
attended by N U S President, Trevor
Phillips, who spoke for the motion,
and was opposed by Martin Stevens,
Conservative M P for Fulham. The
motion was carried, but without
speeches from the floor due to lack
of time.
Both of these events and the
International Fair on Wednesday in
the J C R were organised by the
Overseas Students Committee, as|
is the International Evening which
is to be held in the J C R tonight.
INTERNATIONAL FAIR
T h e I n t e r n a t i o n a l F a i r was
organised as part of International
Week by the Overseas Students
Committee. There were many stalls
around the J C R on W e d n e s d a y
afternoon, most of w h i c h h a d
colourful displays, and books and
leaflets available. The majority of the
overseas societies present supplied
regional food and drinks.
There were two films on Greece
and one on Dakar, Senegal. A n d
there was also folk-dancing.
Several other societies, mostly
religious, also supported this event.
There was also a V S O (Voluntary
S e r v i c e O v e r s e a s ) stall, a n d a
collection for W U S scholarship.
This event ws not as well attended
as it should have been considering
the effort these societies had put in.
FALSE ALARM
A false alarm at the C o l l e g e
branch of the National Westminster
bank on Tuesday brought police
rushing to College thinking there
A/as a hold-up. According to the
police, the alarm, which is triggered
f there is an attempted hold-up;
vas set off by a short-circuit in the
3 P O line connecting the alarm at
he bank to the police station.
FARE INCREASES
T h e fares on the c o a c h e s to
and from H a r l i n g t o n are being
raised to £1.00 (an increase of 40p)
from the start of the next session.
This was decided by the Athletic
Clubs Committee, with agreement
from the clubs, in the preparation
for next year's estimates.
Andy Smith, Secretary of the RCS Motor Club, holds the nozzle
during the first public showing of the capabilities of Jez, now
restored to 100% working order and ready for action.
NURSERY EDUCATION?
Various parts of universities are
being given the evil eye as part of
the cuts, and university nurseries
and creches have not escaped.
P r e v i o u s U n i v e r s i t y G r a n t s
Committee ( U G C ) policy recom-
mended that universities should not
subsidise creches or nurseries for
students a n d staff with y o u n g
children with money from public
funds. A directive from the U G C
to all universities now alters this
recommendation to an instruction,
with 1st August 1980 as a cut-off
date at the latest. Y e t only in
J a n u a r y , U G C C h a i r m a n , D r
Edward Parkes, defended university
autonomy and told MPs that the
U G C "bends over backwards" not to
instruct universities how to spend
their money. O f course, not all
the money a university receives is
from public funds. A n d some of a
nursery's costs are covered by
fees. But many universities will be
affected by this directive, whilst
probably not saving much money
from it. Birmingham, for one, is
expecting to close down its nursery,
making a saving of about £5,000
out of a total annual income of
over £66 million.
In most universities this directive
will affect both students and staff
alike and w o m e n in p a r t i c u l a r ,
meaning that they are left with two
options: not to c o m e (back) to
university or to find some other,
almost certainly m u c h less con-
venient, nursery facility. Some fear
in many cases the decision will be
the former.
BOLLARDS A N D
PAVING STONES
The repairing and construction
works beside Southside are nearing
completion. The work, which started
just over a month ago, involves
putting a dozen concrete bollards
and three wooden benches along the
edge of the pavement by Prince's
Gardens. One of the reasons for
putting in the bollards is to prevent
cars from parking on the pavement,
which not only cause inconvenience
but also cracks the paving stones — a
n u m b e r of w h i c h the C o l l e g e
workman have had to replace in the
past due to cars parking on them.
THEFT FROM LADIES'
CHANGING ROOMS
O n T h u r s d a y last week, two
youths were seen in the ladies'
c h a n g i n g r o o m s in the U n i o n
Building. W h e n d i s t u r b e d by a
m>. nber of the Ladies' Boat Club,
the two escaped across the Quad
without being caught. It was later
f o u n d that a s m a l l a m o u n t of
money had been taken from some-
one's pockets, but it is thought that
they had not been given sufficient
time to take more than this.
