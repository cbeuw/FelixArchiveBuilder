WHEN YO
GRADUATE, GET
THE CREDIT
YOU DESERVE.
The credit you'll get from family
and friends for passing your exams may
be very nice for the ego.
But it won't pay the bills.
The credit you'll get from us, how-
ever;is designed to help you do just that
We'll lend you up to £300 at a
preferential interest rate of 2Vi% over
Barclays Base Rate.
And we won't ask for a penny back
until three months have passed.
(Afterthat,you'llhavetomakerepay-
ments over the following 12 months
whenyoushouldhavearegularincome.)
It'll help see you through that diffi-
cult period between degree and first
salary cheque.When a lot of money
seems to be going out and not much
corning in.
You might need it for a deposit on
a flat To pay for a season
ticket Even, maybe, to
finance the replacement B A R C L A Y S
of your ageing Levis with something
more suitable for your first day at
work.
Of course, to qualify for a graduate
loan you'll have to meet a couple of
conditions.
You'll need to have passed your
degree and have a firm job offer.
Second, we're unlikely to be quite
this generous ifthroughoutyourstudent
career youVe proved an incorrigible
spendthrift
All you have to do is to have a word
with the Student Business Officer at
your local branch.
He'll discuss the details of the
loan with you and, when you move,
arrange the transfer of your account
to the nearest Barclays branch to
your new job or home. He can't help
you pass your finals.
But he can help make
life easier once you do.
