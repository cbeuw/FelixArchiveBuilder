LETTERS
Dear Colin
A s two of the "infestations"
of the Maths Common Room
(who have as much right to be
there as any other mathe-
maticians) we would like to reply
to the letters concerning ICWA
in last week's FELIX.
W e feel that I C W A does
represent the views of women on
Council since it holds general
meetings regularly (the next
being on Tuesday 4th March at
1:00pm in the ICWA Lounge)
w h e r e r e l e v a n t t o p i c s are
discussed and women's opinions
noted. Katy Tatchell and Kirsten
Pratt are on Council to represent
Life Scientists' and Mathemat-
i c i a n s ' i n t e r e s t s , whereas
Merche Clark is there specifi-
cally to present women's issues.
There is also the possibility, in
future years, of there being no
women at all on Council, except
the ICWA President.
The point was raised that
women do not have the right to
choose whether to be a member
of ICWA or not. The same could
be said of the C C U s or even
I C U . The choice is over whether
or not to take an active partv and
unlike Opsoc and Ladies Rugby,
no particular skills are required
to enjoy the company of women.
We feel that our integration into
College life has been helped by
the existence of ICWA, and
although many women are able
to get o n in the C o l l e g e
atmosphere, I C W A is present to
benefit the minority who cannot.
Yours sincerely

Dear Colin
T h e r e a p p e a r s to be a
misunderstanding around the
arguments for the retention of
Imperial C o l l e g e W o m e n ' s
A s s o c i a t i o n . F i o n a Sinclair
(FELIX 544) has said that women
"can get on in a minority". I

Dear Colin
Re Bernard Smith's letter on
student grants and education
cuts. The grants motion wa%
inferring that London students
should get an increased grant
in relation to provincial students.
This, I believe, is a selfish attitude
since we know the government is
cutting b a c k o n e d u c a t i o n
expenditure and the only way we
could get an increase is at the
expense of provincial students.
Since attempts have been made
to single out London University,
and in particular Imperial College
as a 'special case' it would have
further isolated us from the rest
of the student population, if
manage. They can get top Union
posts and many take full part in
social activities organised by
many other groups other than
ICWA.
The question is not, can we
survive without ICWA (as we
can probably survive without lots
of things, eg ICU!) but does
ICWA help or hinder the .status,
welfare and social life of women
(and men). In discussing this
question beware of being side-
tracked into merely discussing
what ICWA does or says at any
particular point in time and
whether it could have been done
better. ICWA is always open to
constructive criticism.
Many of the statements going
around are gross misrepre-
sentations of the truth. T o take •
only one example1
: the ICWA
newsletter at the start of the year
advertised the German Measles
campaign organised by the
Health Centre, yet Fiona claims
ICWA wanted nothing to do with
it. T h i s startling p i e c e of
deduction is based (I discovered)
on somebody somewhere for-
getting to take away some
leaflets given to them on this
subject.
ICWA is an umbrella organ-
isation for any activities that
women want to organise. ICWA
is presently going through a
difficult transition period in that
many of the traditional functions
it organised, such as the Ball,
have c e a s e d to be widely
appreciated but not enough
people have yet injected new
ideas for social activities. Despite
this there have, this year, been a
very successful Freshers Tea,
Christmas Debate and a Bar
Night, to say nothing of various
smaller events (trips to the
theatre and to self defence
classes).
Returning to the question,
does ICWA help or hinder?
Firstly, it is not just because
women are a minority that they
have some common interests
and problems. The problem is
passed. It would have been
further evidence, to them, that
IC students are self-centred and
uninterested in students in
general.
We should be concentrating
more on the effects of the real
cuts in education. Bernard has
stated that we are opposing cuts
in the 'increases of educational
expenditure'. This is a fallacy. M r
John Smith, the College secre-
tary, has said that over the next
four years the College grant may
drop from £30m to £27m. In no
way can this be called a cut in
proposed 'increases'.
As far as the means test is
concerned, I would be interested
one of society at large. Women
are still discriminated against in
job opportunities and society still
portrays the image of the 'quiet
woman at home' or the 'sexy
woman about town' or various
other stereotypes. It is difficult to
find many television series with
say the hero a women engineer.
It does help to have an
organisation where women can
get together on a social level to
convince themselves that to be a
woman engineer or scientist
does not make you any more of a
freak than the next engineer or
scientist. You can often get the
feeling that IC is still only just
tolerating women (I need only
m e n t i o n M i n e s male only
freshers' dinners as one exam-
ple). For women to organise our
o w n s o c i a l a c t i v i t i e s d o e s
something to tip the balance
back in our favour. (By the way,
none of ICWA's social events
have ever been women only — it
is in the ICWA constitution to
encourage social intercourse
between men and women.)
O n the welfare side, the case
for ICWA is indisputable." O n the
issues of ensuring adequate
contraceptive advice, abortion
facilities, in discussing security
against attack at College, ICWA
has a clear role which it has
always p l a y e d . O f c o u r s e
individual women can raise these
issues, but a particular organ-
isation or individual (eg, ICWA
President) is needed whose job it
is to look into these issues.
T o those who argue that the
existence of ICWA hinders the
progress of women because we
admit to not being able to
manage as individuals, I will just
ask two questions. Margaret
Thatcher is Prime Minister,
simultaneously nursery educa-
tion and facilities are being cut.
Has, therefore, an individual
woman's success helped or
hindered the progress of women
as a whole? Secondly, if it is true
that the way to solve the problem
of stereotyping women's roles
to hear what Bernard is trying to
say, his first sentence in the
second paragraph makes little
sense. I agree that the means test
should be abolished and that all
students should get increased
grants to take a c c o u n t of
inflation, but surely at the
moment the most important
issue must be cuts in education.
We must oppose them fully and
effectively, o t h e r w i s e the
education system in this country
will degenerate rapidly.
Yours sincerely

and discrimination in opportu-
nities in this college and society is
by ignoring the whole problem,
and if women's special needs and
problems can be solved without
any joint discussion amongst
those affected, shouldn't we
close down all. special interest
groups given any particular
status by the Union, including
the postgraduate group and the
overseas students committee?
There clearly is a case for the
retention of I C W A with its
present status — not because
without it women are weak but
because with it we are stronger. I
hope that all women who want to
continue the battle to further
enhance the status of women at
IC will attend the next ICWA
general meeting to plan the next
stage of the campaign.

Dear Sir
It is my deepest regret to
inform you that my opinion of
the weekly Imperial College
student newspaper FELIX has
been rapidly deteriorating. I
discovered very little from the
issues of the past six months
apart from a few pictures
which are designed to provoke
s e x u a l e x c i t e m e n t . Is this
suggesting the existence of a
probable room for improvement,
or is this a direct reflection of the
quality of thinking among the
students of a so-called highly
recognised academic establish-
ment.
