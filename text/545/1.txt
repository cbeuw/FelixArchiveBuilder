Last Monday afternoon, Mark Smith was in the
IC honoured Professor Abdus Great Hall to see the lecture
Salam, winner of the 1979 he gave to over a thousand
Nobel Prize for Physics. students and staff.
" C A N I UNIFY GRAVITY?"
T h e Professor, w h o has held the chair
of T h e o r e t i c a l P h y s i c s at t h e C o l l e g e

Professor's past a n d present colleagues,

concerning his career. F o r instance, the
R e c t o r admitted that he w a s offered the
chair of Theoretical P h y s i c s before S a l a m
and h a d t u r n e d it d o w n !
F o l l o w i n g his i n t r o d u c t i o n , P r o f e s s o r

audience for well over a n hour, i n what

lecture.
O f special note was his w a r m , h u m o r o u s
presentation; at one point nearing the end of
the lecture he t u r n e d to the R e c t o r a n d
quipped, " C a n I unify gravity? It'll take m e

T h r o u g h o u t the whole lecture S a l a m was
not satisfied with just presenting present
knowledge. H e e x t e n d e d the ideas where
possible to illustrate points for the future
investigation. Indeed, the final t e n minutes
included m u c h speculation o n the possible
results from the bigger particle accelerators
now under c o n s t r u c t i o n a r o u n d the w o r l d .

Salam's dedication to physics.
T h e thanks of the students present c a n

as informative. T h e Professor must be
