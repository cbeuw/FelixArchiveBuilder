R E V I E W S
Adapted from Euripides and other
classical authors by John Barton and
Kenneth Cauander. Directed by John
Barton. RSC, Aldwych.
This is an immense theatrical extrava-
ganza in three evenings, a compression,
or distillation of the Iliad thrown in for
good measure. Y o u could try just the first
part before deciding to see the remainder,
but buying tickets for all three saved me
twenty percent. Judging by the queue at
the box office, it's unlikey that you'll get a
student standby ticket.
W h i l e h a v i n g n o p r e t e n s i o n s to a
classical education, your reviewer did not
enter the A l d w y c h theatre without some
previous ideas about the Trojan W a r and
the O r e s f e i a . Y o u c a n n o t l o o k in any
direction of modern literature and drama
(not to mention C h a u c e r and Shakespeare)
without encountering a reflection of these
ancient stories: T S Eliot, J P Sartre and
E O ' N e i l l , to n a m e b u t t h r e e , h a v e
reworked the G r e e k tragedies, and they
are also the basis of the fair proportion of
opera texts ("La Belle Helene", "Elekra").
However, be not affrighted that this is a
lot of high-brow culture; there's plenty of
s e x , v i o l e n c e , i n c e s t a n d b u c k e t s of
blood. In fact, first-class family entertain-
ment.
Although the text is not stilted, neither
is it as absurdly colloiquial as the recent
T V dramatisation of the Orestia. In order
to compress the plays, J o h n Barton has
cut most of the longer speeches and since
we a r e s e e i n g a c o m p l e t e c y c l e , the
synopses are unnecessary at the start of
each play. There is therefore only one
P r o l o g u e , a c o m p i l a t i o n of m y t h s w i t h
which the C h o r u s (female throughout) set
the scene.
B y seeing the full cycle, we see all the
loose ends of the individual plays tied
together, and therefore the stories you
already k n o w are more understandable.
F o r e x a m p l e , it is e a s i e r to see w h y
Orestes carves up his mother with an axe
if y o u k n o w that she k i l l e d his father
(Agamemnon), in turn because he had
( r e l u c t a n t l y ) s a c r i f i c e d his d a u g h t e r
(Iphigenia) to the gods.
M o s t of the plays follow the standard
p a t t e r n of G r e e k d r a m a , v i z , g r o w i n g
c o n f l i c t l e a d i n g to a v i o l e n t c l i m a x , in
which actors charge offstage with vicious
looking weapons and their victims stagger
on bleeding. O n l y in the third evening,
" T h e G o d s " do we encounter the deux
e x machina; i n e a c h of the last t h r e e
plays, a deity appears at the end of to
sort it all out. M y heart went out to J o h n
S h r a p n e l , as A p o l l o , w h o has a v e r y
t o n g u e - i n - c h e e k s p e e c h at the e n d of
" O r e s t e s " and, since this follows the only
comedy ("Helen") the audience are still
rather giggly. In fact, the gods are treated
as a j o k e t h r o u g h o u t , e s p e c i a l l y t h e
dumbe blonde Thetis, mother of Apollo,
w h o c a n twist Z e u s a r o u n d her little
f i n g e r ; A r t e m i s a n d A p h r o d i t e n e v e r
actually appear but get cursed a lot and
only A t h e n a (Billie Whitelaw) wants to
give the mortals a fair deal.

Dearth.
A c h i l l e s , t h e " b e s t w a r r i o r of t h e
G r e e k s " , was played (by M i k e G w i l y m ,
w h o a l s o t a k e s t h e p a r t of O r e s t e s )
somewhere between the pansy depicted
by Shakespeare and the warrior of the
Iliad. After seeng his mother, one could
only expect him to be pretty mixed-up.
Achilles' slave Briseis (Jenny Lipman), the
cause of his row with A g a m e m n o n (John
Shrapnel) was one of the strongest minor
c h a r a c t e r s . In o u r o p i n i o n , the m o s t
outstanding actor was Edwin Richfield as
Talthybius, the man who gets all the dirty
jobs like murdering unwanted children._
The direction is thorough and imagin-
ative, and more realistic than any ancient
production would have been. T h e C h o r u s
MIKE RUTHERFORD
SMALL CREEP'S DAY
(Charisma)
H e r a l d e d by a s t i c k e r o n the c o v e r
which says: " A Genesis solo album; M i k e
Rutherford â€” Guitars". This is a superb
offering, possibly the best of the 'splinter'
albums recently produced by members
of Genesis (although T o n y B a n k s ' offering
was as part of B r a n d X ) .
The first side is a continuous theme
about, oddly enough, Small Creep's D a y
(inspired by the book of the same name
by P e t e r C u r r e l l B r o w n ) . O n e of the
seven sections, " W o r k i n g In L i n e " is the
new single, which has been getting a fair
amount of airplay on IC Radio. The whole
piece of music hangs together very well,
but e a c h section is definitely different;
more so than the separate parts of the
Floyd's "Shine O n Y o u C r a z y D i a m o n d " .
It is, in fact, almost half an hour long, and
always have some business to attencj. to,
rather than the static C h o r u s which the
o r i g i n a l p r o d u c t i o n w o u l d h a v e u s e d ,
2,000 years ago. Purists might say that a
d i r e c t o r s h o u l d k e e p to the a u t h o r ' s
intentions and attempt to reproduce the
ancient style of presentation; I suspect
that this would be extremely boring for a
m o d e r n a u d i e n c e . P e r h a p s d r a m a has
"progressed" since 3 0 0 B C , so that even
within classical forms and ancient texts,
"live" theatre can be created. In the usual
style of the R S C , a dance was interjected
at each of many points in the cycle, a n d
the grand finale is a sequence of dances.
The amplified music irritated me a little at
first, but by the end the recurring tunes
were growing on me.
Other reviews of this production have
c o n c e n t r a t e d o n i n f e r r i n g a p o l i t i c a l
message, some anachronisms are intro-
duced in order to relate the action tp the
modern world; the soldiers' uniforms are
almost modern, and Orestes and friends
use machine guns. But there is no single
political message. T h e use of an entirely
female chorus, and the large proportion
of speeches from female characters, seem
to give the production a "feminist" slant;
but the message seems to be more about
h o w the G r e e k s t r e a t e d w o m e n t h a n
about w o m e n in modern society. There is
n o t s o m u c h o n e m e s s a g e a s o n e
viewpoint of the subjects, as framed by
the selection of texts. T h e power of the
gods is played down, and the motivation
of human greed, jealousy and revenge is
shown clearly. Even the characters come
to realise that the gods they worship are
really aspects of their o w n personalities;
and that A t h e n a (Wisdom) is the god to
follow, rather than any other.
Stongly recommended.
Derrick Everett
is mostly instrumental with some vocals in
each section, sung by N o e l M c C a l l a .
T h e second side is c o m p o s e d of five,
separate tracks and opens with " M o o n -
shine"; a track which leaves the listener in
no doubt that this is by a member of
Genesis. It's possibly the strongest track
on the album and reminds me o L a couple
of tracks on the last Genesis album ". . .
and then there were three . . .".
T h e other tracks stand up well in this
context, especially " R o m a n i " , which has a
good melodic r h y t h m , yet rocks along,
again very m u c h in the Genesis style. The
similarity could be because the album is
produced by D a v i d Hentchell, the same
producer as Genesis use.
I think that this is certainly an excellent
a l b u m , e v e n t h e s l e e v e d e s i g n , b y
Hipgnosis, is very eye-catching. I have no
hesitation in recommending this album to
a n y o n e ; it's a l m o s t as g o o d as a n e w
Genesis album.
