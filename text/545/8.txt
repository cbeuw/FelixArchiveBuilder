CAMBORNE FEBRUARY 1980
O n the morning of Friday 15th February, ninety-seven Miners
congregated in the front entrance of Mines for the biannual trip
down to Camborne. Amidst the expressions, were the solemn
worried look of the players to the exuberant cheeful look of the
supporters. T h e coaches departed at 10:00am, one to the
familiar sound of Swan cans opening, the other to the quietness
of Steve Gatley's Poker Ring. Three stops were endured on the
eight hour journey and at one in particular, Messrs Pryor and
Flectcher 'commandeered* two female hitchhikers to accompany
the supporters coach, much to the chagrin of the players, and
Mr Hofmeyr in particular.
Arrival in Camborne at 6:00pm, realised the ineptitude of the
Camborne School of Mines organisational capabilities. After
checking in at the many hotels dotted around Camborne, a few
of us trooped off to the well-endowed leisure centre to watch
the badminton, squash and table tennis tournaments. Following
an eight hour coach journey, none of our players felt fighting fit,
but nevertheless put up a great performance. Their badminton
team ran ours to a close second (5-0), while the table tennis,
under the leadership of General Julian 'Broken Finger' Norley,
crushed their opponents 8-2. The squash was a close run affair
with Camborne pipping us at the post 3-2, even though we won
first and second places with love games through Dirk 'Bogart'
Remijse and Ian Stevenson. We all then retired to the Tyacks
Hotel where there was a disco with an accompanying sign 'No
Dancing Allowed'! Many hours later we all retired, looking
forward to beating Camborne on the morrow; little did we
know!
Saturday dawned, bright and sunny, a vast difference from the
corresponding time two years previously. C a m b o r n e then
informed us that the football would be at 10:30am instead of
hockey and the hockey would then be on an all weather pitch.
Thus there was a mad scramble to find braining shoes.
Camborne being one of the most important football matches
of the season, meant that the Mines first team had to stay in
their hotel on the Friday night previous to the match, this was
just as well since the bar didn't close until 1:00pm, and most
people drank too much.
Morning came with us finding that Camborne played on what
resembled a pile of manure. Both sides found it very difficult to
play on six inches of mud, especially since the ball didn't bounce
or roll. The wings had quite firm ground with grass on, and
consequently most attacks came from this direction.
Mines went ahead through T o m Hanke straight after the kick-
off, with Camborne equalising a few minutes later. From then
until the second half the Camborne goal came under constant
pressure. Ian .Stevenson put us 2-1 up with a tremendous left
foot drive from twenty yards out to the bottom left-hand post.
Later Si'.kri Yahya made it 3-1 with some neat footwork in the
penalty area. Camborne then had another attack, where in a
puddle; the Camborne player and Stewart Briggs fell over each
other, with a penalty the decision. That made it 3-2. Until half-
time the Camborne keeper made some good saves to keep the
score down.
The second half started with Mines under pressure for five
minutes, which then broke with a good move down the left wing
with T o m Hanke slotting in our fourth goal. Sukri made it 5-2
with an 'Archies' opportunists goal from outside the box. Later
our keeper Mick Redwood brilliantly saved a penalty at the foot
of the post. T o m ' s hat-trick goal came from an impossible angle
on the by-line after a good chasing run.
In the last few minutes a rare C a m b o r n e attack, due to our
full-back being injured, gave them a consolation goal to make
the final score 6-3.
M o s t of the play was in midfield where the ball was being dug
out of the pitch. This brought d o w n the standard of both teams,
though on good ground it would have been too easy for us.
T h e keen second team players that filled the gaps, Iain House
and Stewart Briqqs. and also Ian Stevenson from IC fitted in
very well with Ian and T o m competing for man-of-the-match
T h e game was really m a d e by the m a n y supporters w h o
raised the standard of both teams on a difficult surface.
T h e hockey started immediately afterwards, and with plenty of
support from the touchlines, R S M soon took the lead. W i t h
Generals Steve Gatley and Ian C r o w e in midfield, R S M never
lost control of the game. Myself not being an expert at hockey, I
could not detail amongst the swinging sticks, who in fact were
the scorers. W e w o n comfortably 4-1 and congratulations go to
M i k e Langley w h o survived the m a t c h without a cigarette.
We now had one hour until the start of the Bottle M a t c h . This
was plenty of time to stock up on the food and alcoholic stakes.
The Bottle, w h i c h stands behind the U n i o n B a r , has been played
for between R S M and C S M since 1945, although this contest
originally started in the 1920s.
T h e rivalry between the only two S c h o o l of M i n e s in the
country is intense and most of the prestige of the weekend and
of the successive year lies in the winning of the Bottle.
Kick-off was due at 3:00pm. W e s t w a r d Television were there
and so was our resident reporter in Cornwall; Colin 'Cheers'
Palmer. T h e two teams came onto the field to an enormous roar
from the 300+ crowd. R S M immediately took control and after
fifteen minutes, B r y a n Mecklenbergh charged down a kick, fell
o n the ball and scored. Five minutes later, R S M won a s c r u m on
t h e i r t e n y a r d l i n e , D a v e R h o d e s r e c e i v e d t h e b a l l , a n d
proceeded to make one of the most incredible breaks I've ever
seen in a rugby match. After sidestepping six men, he passed to
A n d y Lewis who tripped and dived a full ten yards over the line
in the corner. T h e game remained in the C a m b o r n e half with
constant pressure from the R S M forwards and with beautiful
probing kicks from D a v e Rhodes. T h e next try came from a
s c r u m o n the twenty-five. B y making use of a well-rehearsed
m o v e in the centres, Paul Atherley on the left wing had an
overlap a n d scored; Keith M a y n a r d converted. A t half-time R S M
w e r e 14-0 i n the l e a d . I m m e d i a t e l y after the t u r n a r o u n d .
M a y n a r d added a penalty and a short while later added a second
(20-0). B u t in the true style of the Bottle match, C a m b o r n e did
not give up and they did apply short bursts of pressure in the
middle of the half. W i t h time virtually gone, R S M launched an
assault on the C a m b o r n e line. After one disallowed try, Dave
H o f m e y r s t a r t e d to find a lot of r o o m at the base of the
s c r u m a n d eventually finished off a lovely m o v e w h i c h was
handled by many of the team. T h e final score stood at 24-0, the
highest ever margin; the previous highest being 20-8 in 1938!
Folowing a rather disorganised supper in the evening we duly
celebrated in the bar, to pour onto the coaches at 12:30 and
arrive bleary-eyed at S o u t h Kensington at 7:30am.
I would like to thank all the players for their wonderful team
efforts a n d t h a n k all the s u p p o r t e r s for the m a g n i f i c e n t
encouragement they gave to all teams.
