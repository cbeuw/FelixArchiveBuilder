THE SORCERER
C h e a p ! But that was only the price;
that one should also have seen a perfor-
m a n c e of C o x And Box in the s a m e
evening, made it all even better. Undoubt-

mistakes in both productions, but all in all
it was a n enjoyable evening and represen-
tative of the standard of the A r t s at I C .
B y way of explanation, Cox And Box was

they like to maintain the distinction. The

of the fact, as one w o r k s in the daytime

casting here was questionable; might not
the stronger voice of Sgt Bouncer, the
landlord, have been paired with one of
the brothers, to prevent the rather one-
sided duets that the brothers sang?
O n the other hand The Sorcerer, the
main event, involved a cast of some forty-

stage in the U n i o n C o n c e r t Hall was a
little too small for the chorus of villagers,
who had to c r a m themselves into the side
of the stage to leave r o o m for the main
characters, but for all that, the singing

credit that during the performance they

PHOENIX HAS RISEN
If literature is the reflection of life as we
live it, then this new, and excellently
produced, edition of Phoenix articulates
the lives of many of us at this College,
and, I would suspect the lives of many in
this country. It is unfortunate but true,
that m o s t s t u d e n t l i t e r a r y efforts are
elliptical to the point of obscurity, mainly,
I would suspect, to hide a fundamental
lack of imagination. This is definitely not
t h e c a s e w i t h The Phoenix. S t e v e
M a r s h a l l a n d h i s d e d i c a t e d b a n d ot
helpers have produced a journal (for want
of a better word), the articles of which
a r e i n t h e m a i n v e r y r e a d a b l e a n d
u n d e r s t a n d a b l e . T h e r e w e r e t w o or
three which I could not follow — the fault
probably being my own.
Before I c o m e to the main subject of
this review, the way some articles reflect
life in this College, I will give an all too
b r i e f a c c o u n t of s o m e of t h e o t h e r
contents, in order to give a flavour of the
whole. B o t h Steve Marshall and M a r k
S m i t h have spent considerable time in the
afthives researching the past issues of
Phoenix, a n d h a v e r e p r i n t e d , q u i t e
j u s t i f a b l y , s o m e o t h e r w i s e u n k n o w n
material. T h e r e is a selection of writing
from past editorials, reporting on such
events as the closing of the old Union
Building to how to write for The Phoenix.
But, my favourite extract must, naturally,
be the account of S C C some quarter
century ago, when it forbad the formation
of the Methodist Society because it was
'sectarian'! The real reason was that S C C
w a s b e c o m i n g t o o l a r g e w i t h t h e
formation of new societies, and had, for
the sake of administrative efficiency, to be
split up into the major subcommittees.
A l s o reprinted, apparently for the first
time is H G Wells' The Chronic Argonauts.
H G Wells, when he was a student at this
C o l l e g e f o u n d e d The Phoenix a n d
published his early stories in it; he later
considered them so bad that he attempted
to destroy all back copies of The Phoenix,
but as will be appreciated without total
success. A s is pointed out this early story
contains the embryo for both the Time
Machine a n d Invisible Man. In The Chronic
Argonauts we see the genesis of Wells's
prose style and also why he attempted to
destroy the story since it does not really
bear c o m p a r i s o n with his later work.
However, the story does stand up by itself
and is most definitely worth reading to see
how Wells later developed the ideas which
he had as a student in this College.
The story is illustrated by modern black
and white drawings and are of a high quality,
especially that facing the opening page of
the story by Ian Wieczorek. T h e general
standard of illustration in The Phoenix is
high; there are two 'strip' cartoons, one in
modern style, which I did not care for
particularly. T h e other is in 'Victorian' style
a n d c o n t a i n s p a s t i c h e s in w o r d s a n d
drawings of the secret thoughts of people in
a Victorian village, presumably inspired by
Under Milk Wood.
The theme which is prominent through-
out the whole journal appears to be a
description of the lack of basic human
contact in life today, which, ironically
includes being part of a crowd. This theme is
especially epitomised by Ian Holliday's
c a r t o o n ' S o u t h s i d e F i r s t W e e k ' , Ian
Wieczorek's poem 'So Different' and K C
M a n n ' s brilliant short evocation 'There Has
N e v e r B e e n A n y o n e F a m o u s C a l l e d
Trevor'. If there is any one in this College
who says he cannot feel any sympathy for
'Trevor', then he is either a liar, very lucky,
or Trevor himself! I cannot do full justice to
the story, but will simply say that it is a
description of a man who fulfils all that is
expected of him, sacrificing, in the process,
all hope of any deep personal relationship;
but at the same time he does not perceive
that this is what he is doing. K C M a n n has
not only constructed a tightly knit essay, but
it is minutely observed, without becoming
tedious, and is tautly written.
In relation to this theme — essentially of
the non-realisation of any purpose of life —
Ian Holliday's cartoon 'Southside First
W e e k ' shows two students on opposite
sides of a wall, wondering if there is anybody
there to be contacted. In the event of such
contact existing then Ian Wieczorek's poem
" S o Different" carries this to extremes and
suggests that people become "one of the
c r o w d " , in other words people are not
different. H e illustrates this by suggesting
that the " c r o w d " enforces its will on each
individual "different you're not, sameness
exudes". This, it will be appreciated, returns
us to the character of 'Trevor', who is
shining through in their own right.

subsequently take it upon themselves to
m a k e the inhabitants of their village a
party to their o w n good fortune. T o this
end they acquire the services of J Wells
and C o , Family Sorcerers, with unfortun-
ate consequences, but (sigh of relief) a
happy ending.

himself to follow a particular path.
If the picture I have painted appears
gloomy, it is not meant to be, but I see no
point in writing romantic nonsense which
c a n n o t r e l a t e t o p e o p l e ' s l i v e s . In
producing this edition of The Phoenix,
S t e v e M a r s h a l l has a t t e m p t e d to say
something about the way we live, in this
college in particular and in this country
(and America?) in general. H e is to be
congratulated in unearthing a-collection of
w r i t e r s a n d a r t i s t s w h o are able to
express, simply and with a considerable
amount of imagination, ideas about the
way we live. I disagree profoundly with
Macbeth's view that "life is full of sound
and fury, signifying nothing", but we do
need to know where we are going and
these works in The Phoenix express quite
clearly that we do not know, it is up to us
to try and find out.
