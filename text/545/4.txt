Lots of people have already announced
their intention of taking part in the Great
imperial Rag Mag Selling Competition
next weekend from Friday 29th February
to Sunday 2nd March and hopefully there
will be lots more. The basic idea is to go
somewhere for the weekend, either on
your own or in teams of up to four
people, and sell as many Rag Mags as
possible. There are izes for travelling
the furthest, selling ine most Rag Mags,
travelling in the most original manner and
seUing the most Rag Mags per hour
Remember you have to sell at least a
hundred to qualify, and the time limits are
from Friday lunchtime to Sunday evening
when the bell rings in the Union Bar
Entries must be in to Rae Snee, via your
V P o r S o c R e p , b y M o n d a y 25th
February. More detailed rules are in last
week's FELIX or available from your soc
reps. _ T v .
O K everyone, you can stop worrying
about how bored you'll be on 8th March,
because you're alj invited to . . . yes, a
jelly and ice cream party! About fifty deaf
children and various T V celebrities are
coming along for a T o s s - t h e - C a b e r
competition in Prince's Gardens, which
will be followed by tea in Southside, so if
you like children and silly games this is an
event specially for y o u . It is a good
chance to meet some of the children who
will be receiving the phonic hearing aids
which we've been collecting for this year,
and the more people there the better so
come along if you want a good Saturday
afternoon.

A s y o u all noticed in last week's
Broadsheet, it's now R C S election time
(the papers come down tomorrow if you
want to stand). N e x t T h u r s d a y 28th
February candidates for the President,
Vice President, Honorary Secretary, H J T
and Academic Affairs Officer are required
to speak on why they want to be elected
and how they intend to run your Union.
This Hustings Union General Meeting is
extremely important and since these
people will directly influence your life in
the Royal College of Science I would
advise you strongly to come to Physics
Lecture Theatre 1 at 12:45pm. The voting
takes place on Monday 3rd March by
paper ballot using the single transferable
vote system.
O n t o t h e subject of R a g a n d the
Valentines Rag Stunt managed to attract
fifteen people, two of whom were too
tired to collect anything at all, but still
staggered down to Harrods clutching a
virgin rag can to lend moral support to
the rest of us. Y o u may laugh, but at
least they m a d e s o m e effort whilst
e v e r y o n e w a l l o w e d i n the r o m a n t i c
alcoholic warmth left from the Valentines
Party which had been organised for you
by some of the' people on the Rag Stunt.
Let's see a bit more involvement, even if
it's only a morning standing outside
Harrods with a rag can.
A n y w a y , Imperial College R a g has
adopted an R C S idea to sell Rag Mags.
There is doubtless an article on the Great
Imperial Rag Race somewhere else in the
paper, but I'd just like to reiterate that it
is open to every one of you.
If you're going away next weekend see
Rachel Snee, or ring int 4255 and put
your name down for the race. Take a pile
of Rag Mags away and sell them. There
are prizes for the most Rag Mags sold,
the most sold per hour, the farthest
distance travelled from IC and the most
unusual method of travel. Let's bring all
these prizes to R C S and make sure the
Rag Mag makes a profit for the deaf
children.
M I N E S
We fed Camborne and we fed Camborne
. . . What a fantastic weekend. That will go
down in the annals of history as one of the
most successful and enjoyable weekends
the R S M has ever had. Many many thanks
must go to Pete 'Do you want to play on my
piano?' Newman who organised with
supreme efficiency the best of a hundred not
so sober miners, without losing any. (A
w r i t e - u p of t h e w e e k e n d a p p e a r s
' somewhere else in this issue of FELIX.)
By the time of printing some definite
course will be taken over the future of
, freshers' dinners. Depending on the results
from the G e n Comm last Tuesday I will
propose some sort of change.
This Sunday sees the R S M Soccer Sixes.
Anybody who wishes to enter a team must
see Steve Hinde or Dave Everett (Min Geol
3 or Min 2 respectively). TODAY should
prove to be another excellent day out at
Hariington.
We are coming to the time of year
when we have to dig out our webbed feet
and hands for the Swimming Gala on 3rd
M a r c h . T h e prize for this is a large
beautiful shield which can be seen in the
*ICU Office. This year, with the help of
you budding swimmers, it will hopefully
return to its rightful owners — the RSM.
Now as your representative on the
Bookshop Committee, I ought to tell you
what R S M paraphenalia there is for you
to buy: hand painted wall shields £5; R S M
cufflinks £1.34; stickpins 25p; blazer
buttons, large 5p, small 4p; blazer
embroidered badges £8.12; R S M full
colours ties (silk) £3.22; R S M half colours
ties (silk) £3.22; R S M squares £1.91; K S M
full colours squares £1.91; R S M sports
ribbon (for wrapping around boaters!) 19p
a yard.
Now if anyone wants to buy any of the
above — you must produce your union
card.
Well boys, many thanks for the support
last weekend.
Cheers
Bernie
