/ WAS THERE
C H R I S F O X — 1980
S o there I was and in he walked. I was
surprised to find that T e d Heath looked
just like he does in his photographs, only
he was shorter than expected.
After the usual preliminaries, I handed
over the 1,750+ student signatures and
the 273 staff ones (wh'ch particularly
i m p r e s s e d h i m ) . I t h e n t o l d h o w the
present Government's policy on overseas
students would:
(a) Affect Imperial College — T h e
r e d u c t i o n i n n u m b e r of o v e r s e a s
students, the massive reduction in the
College grant, and the potential loss in
expertise, eg, A b d u s Salam (a signatory
of t h e p e t i t i o n ) w a s a n o v e r s e a s
student.
(b) Affect T h e C o u n t r y — The general
effects a n d the fact that o v e r s e a s
students don't cost as m u c h as the
Government says.
(c) Affect T h e Overseas Students —
The W U S report which shows how
the d i s t r i b u t i o n of a p p l i c a t i o n s has
c h a n g e d , t h e T h i r d W o r l d b e i n g
reduced greatly.
In reply the Right H o n E Heath O B E
M P said that he agreed with me, that the
Government was 'short sighted' on this
issue, that other backbench Conservative
M P s agreed with him and he thought that
they might be able to make some changes
in the proposed legislation. H e concluded
by saying that the petition (the first he
had received) was a good way of getting
things started.
W h a t h a p p e n e d m a y o r m a y n o t
significantly change the course of history,
but of all the protests, etc, we have
organised I feel it must rank as one of the
most successful.
Phil C o l e and the other members of the
C u t s C o m m i t t e e a l o n g w i t h E x t e r n a l
Affairs will be organising a conference of

which will be discussing the more broad
aspects of the cuts. T h e provisional date
for this is 15th M a r c h .
