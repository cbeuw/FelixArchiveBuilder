24hr PEDAL CAR RACE
In keeping with tradition, G u i l d s
entered two teams in the National
Twenty-four hour Pedal Car Race, held
annually at Whitchurch Airfield, Bristol.
Two minibuses containing the teams,
back-up crew and others, left College at
10:30am on Friday and arrived in Bristol
at 2:00pm, one hour before the race was
due to start. After a couple of practice
laps it was discovered that one of the
pedals on the men's car had almost
sheared off and so emergency repairs
were made to it. This problem caused a
great deal of trouble throughout the race
and was undoubtedly the reason why the
men's team did not win their race, thus
proving to Rolls Royce (the eventual
winners) that it should not need a £3,000
car nor a research and development
budget of £90,000 to win the race.
Unfortunately, the problem meant that
the men's team started the race forty-five
minutes late. The ladies' team also had
mechanical problems at the start and they
started the race twenty minutes late. Until
about 10:00pm, the men had to make
regular pit stops in order to tighten their
pedal up, but then, someone thought of
swopping the pedals round, solving the
problem for the next four hours. It was
about this time that some supporters
arrived in the form of Jamie, Bryan and
Mark, giving a boast in morale by their
presence and a boast in speed by their
pushing.
HOCKEY
ULU CUP — SEMI-FINAL
QMC vs IC: 0 — 4
lf£ fielding one of their strongest
sides ever, progressed to the final of
the University of London C u p at the
expense of a strengthened Q M C side.
This will be the first time in seven
years that an IC side has reached the
final and on this performance they
stand a good chance of lifting the Cup
as the climax of an otherwise average
season.
Despite various delays — late arrival
of one player and the captain's kit not
being available — the IC side reached
Dytchleys in good time for the start.
They were met by a Q M C side full of
confidence — the Q M C team having
'imported' three star players from the
U L team who had in turn brought
along a coachload of supporters.
T h e q u i e t , c o n f ' d e n t , c a r e f r e e
approach of the IC side should have
warned the Q M C side of impending
disaster — the Q M C side however
w e r e t o o i n v o l v e d in a n a m a z i n g
series of warm-up exercises in front of
their admiring supporters to notice
the w a r m i n g - u p routine of the IC
centre-half.
T h e w a r m i n g - u p routine of this
s m a l l , q u i e t M a l a y s i a n p l a y e r did
nothing to indicate the ensuing havoc
At about 2:00am, the pedal broke again
on the men's car and so the car was
brought in for a lengthy pit stop whilst the
pedal was virtually remade. This also gave
the team a welcome break and a chance
to get some sleep.
Meanwhile, the ladies had overtaken
the Marrey Ferguson team who were the
early l e a d e r s , a n d were gradually
increasing their lead.
At about 3:00am, the heavens opened
and the track became a mudbath.
Anyone who went out in the car became
instantly covered in a thin layer of mud.
The rain continued until about 9:00am
and the intervening hours were very
miserable. By this time, the members of
both teams were almost comatose,
responding only to the cry of, " O i , it's
your turn next" at intervals ot approx-
imately six minutes. Luckily, there were
no major mishaps during this rainy
season, but almost as the last drops of
rain fell, m i s f o r t u n e (and M a r r e y
Ferguson) overtook the ladies' team when
the steering failed on their car. This
needed a lengthy pit stop to repair it,
causing the ladies to take the lead.
However, this piece of bad luck only
spurred them on to greater things and a
tremendous push by the ladies enabled
them to regain the lead which they
maintined right to the end of the race.
During this period, they. overtook even
the leading men's teams on some of their
laps.
The men's team, on the other hand,
were not so fortunate. The pedal finally
broke beyond all repair thirty minutes
before the end of the race, but they
he was to cause to the result of the
m a t c h a n d the Q M C players ego.
Poon Fook Loke, studying in C C D 3,
is a first choice player for his country
a n d p l a y s w e e k l y for o n e of the
premier clubs in Europe, Southgate.
Playing against the Cowboys of Q M C ,
he p r o c e e d e d in the., first twenty
minutes to antagonise each and every
one of the opponents by sheer skill.
The first goal was scored at the far
post by Johnson Afilaka following a
left s i d e d m o v e a n d s h o t by the
veteran of the team Bob Middleton.
The second goal was set up by Poon -
beating five players and releasing a
perfectly weighted pass to Graeme
Forbes, to hit first time into the roof of
the net. Acting Captain, Tony Debarr
scored the third with an accidental
cross which went into the net and the
fourth goal was scored from a penalty
stroke by Chris Rielly after two IC
players had claimed that the ball had
gone into the net following a shot.
IC thus netted four goals in a match
they could have scored ten, but in cup
competitions it's the result that counts.
IC now go on to the final in three
w e e k s t i m e q u i e t l y c o n f i d e n t of
success, which as in this performance
should come their way.
Phil Webb
managed to finish it at 3:00pm on
Saturday, twenty-four hours after it had
begun, by a piece of surreptitious pushing
and the judicious use of the remaining
(functional) pedal.
So, all in all, a mixed twenty-four hours
for G u i l d s . T h e ladies managed to
become the National Ladies Pedal Car
Champions in the car which won the
men's race exactly ten years ago, whilst
the men were prevented from achieving
the double bv a faulty pedal.
