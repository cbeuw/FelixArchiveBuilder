Le Lounge
est mort
After a long and painful illness
The Lounge, Imperial College's
very own nightclub, passed away
early on Thursday morning .
He will be sorely missed by
many who appreciated the great
sacrifice The Lounge made in
coming to Imperial College
whilst many of his younger
brothers, notably the Hippo-
drome and the Brighton Beach
Disco Nite Klub, fell for the
bright lights and exotic locations.
Mr and Mrs Horace Limey-
Lounge, The Lounge's mother
and father, said in a touching
tribute to their eldest, 'Such a
nice little boy... what did you say
happened to him?...Oh yes,
death...Yes, well, I suppose we'll
miss him, won't we dear...Yes of
course dear'.
Fortunately, IC Ents had very
wisely taken out a Before Need
Arrangement Policy with
Whispering Glades undertakers
whilst the Lounge was in his
optimum earning phase, and
consequently, they say, the
funeral will be a fitting one for
such a well loved nightclub.
Said M r Joy Boy of
Whispering Glades 'Even in
death The Lounge still retained
the happy, smiling features of his
youth. You could tell that spell in
hospital had done him the world
of good.
Accusations of foul play and
bad taste are under investigation,
but the Police say they are not
treating the matter very
seriously.
Flatulence
When the Wind Blows, the award
winning wireless play, is to be
broadcast by IC Radio this
evening, followed by a discussion
on the issues it raises. Written by
Raymond Briggs the play depicts
an elderly couple who survive a
nuclear bomb blast but are
gradually overcome by radiation
sickness. This moving play can be
heard tonight at 8pm followed by
a discussion featuring Consoc
chairman, Graham Brown,
Michael Newman of ICCND,
Hugh Southey and J Martin
Taylor.
IC President Ian Bull reluctantly admitted that his Deputy
President is a werewolf when confronted by the above picture
taken by FELIX staffer Nigel 'Flasher' Atkinson. His victim,
Miss X, was shocked but not harmed and will not be pressing
charges.
Police are not linking Tuesdays events with other Parrynormal
happenings in the area.
UGM
Confusion
The change of location from
the Great Hall to Mech Eng 220
obviously confused the vast
number of students hoping to
attend last Tuesdays Union
General Meeting.
The proceedings began ten
minutes late while Union Officers
waited in vain for the masses to
arrive but decided to start after
the fiftieth person walked in.
All reports were accepted as
written without any objections as
was the motion oil Iraq and the
meeting would have been over
even sooner if Eric Derbyshire,
ICU Hon Sec, had not proposed
several Union Byelaw changes.
These were passed without
objection but they sparked off a
demand for further changes to
remove sexist references from the
constitution. After several
minutes of discussion it was
decided to hold two votes. The
first concerned changing the
word Chairman to Chairperson,
and the second sought to remove
all other sexist references: Both
changes were defeated and the
meeting closed, without the
quorum being challenged, after
only fifteen minutes.
Card sharp
Be warned if you have a Midland
Autobank card. The extra day
because last year was a Leap year
caused the Nat West Servicetill
and Midland Autobank to
become imcompatable. The
Midland's computer forgot
about February 29 and so 1984
ended one day early. The cleverer
Nat West computer remembered
the extra day but penalized
Midland customers by retaining
their cards.
The, error has now been
rectified, but if you used your
Autobank card to obtain money
during the first week of January,
it will still be retained by
Servicetill. Your card must first
be corrected by using it in an
Autobank.
