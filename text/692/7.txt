The
Revolutionary GrandDuke
Yes, it's February again and Opsoc are
producing their traditional February show, this
year The Grand Duke by Gilbert and Sullivan.
However, there is very little traditional about the
show this year, as it is the first time we have
attempted the last and best of the Operas. Indeed,
tradition breaking does not stop there, we have a
far larger orchestra then ever before, and highly
ambitious staging, far beyond any of our previous
attempts. The revolutionary aspects do not stop
there. Our production is very different in itself with
Gilbert's highly complex plot cunningly simplified
by our producer Ellis Pike.

NEW CHAMBERLAINS REQUIRED
As we still have a month to go, we desperately
need help building set and front of house, if you are
interested, please feel free to come to the Concert
Hall any weekend, or contact the Chairman, Gary
Atkins via Chemistry II U G Mail Racks, or any
Opsoc member. If you want to help, or find out what
goes on behind staging a production, now is your
chance to find out.
TICKETS A T LUDICROUSLY LOW PRICES
As you can see tickets are once again a snip this
year. Please buy your tickets early to avoid
disappointment. We will be selling tickets every
lunchfime in level 2 Sheffield from 4 February. We
hope to see you at what promises to be one of our
best ever shows.
SCANDALOUS PRODUCTION
If you saw our production of lolanthe you will
know our attempts to modernise the setting, and
we have done it again, with the show set in 1930's
Germany in the mythical state of Pfennig
Halbfennig, presided over by Grand Duke
Rudolph. The plot involves a planned revolution by
members of Ernest Dummkopf's Theatrical
Company overthrowing Rudolph but things go
hopelessly wrong — but that's giving the plot
away... The score includes much of Sullivan's best
and most exciting choral music, with a dramatic
duel in the first act, and a dithyrambic dance in the
second.
Another feature of lolanthe was the design of the
female choruses costumes, but Duke's costumes
go further with everyone in unexpected dress
throughout.
