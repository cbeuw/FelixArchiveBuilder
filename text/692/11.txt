IC Radio Manager Pete Coleman
really is a dark horse.
When he was at home for
Christmas his mother was
disturbed to find a pair of girl's
knickers under his bed!
And the label inside the
raunchy garments read 'Age 9-12
years'.
Vicar's son Pete (they're
always the worst) didn't know
what to say.
The Deputy President's brain is
missing! Visitors to the Union
Office or Bar recently can't have
failed to notice that Dave 'Mad'
Parry is gradually losing his
marbles as the year progresses,
and it now seems quite likely that
the strain of allocating next
year's Union subvention may be
too much for him. If anyone
happens to mention an item of
expenditure exceeding £3.50 (the
price of a bottle of sherry) in his
presence, his eyes roll as he gently
pulls the offending profligate
major sub-committee chairman
towards him by the lapels to
adminster a sharp blow to the
forehead. One can only hope that
a DP whose own funds are in
danger of falling through the
yawning hole in his jeans pocket
is sufficiently on top of things to
ensure that Union Office
expenditure is being cut along
with that of other parts of the
Union.
