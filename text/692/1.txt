WILLIS JACKSON TO BE EVACUATED
Evelyn War
All six student houses in Evelyn Gardens are in
contravention of Housing Regulations and could be closed
unless repairs estimated at over Â£%m are carried out.
A local authority inspector
visited 66 Evelyn Gardens, part
of Willis Jackson House, in May
1984, and discovered that the
property lacked fire doors, fire
exits, and hot and cold running
water in all rooms. A notice was
obtained that will close the
building unless the repairs are
done. Despite the fact that the
College then knew by the middle
of the summer that the work was
required and the building would
need to be emptied, residents
were only told last week. Mr
Donald Clark, Estates Secretary,
claimed that negotiations with
the Royal Borough of
Kensington and Chelsea, and the
system of allocating contracts,
meant that the warden and
students could only be informed
six weeks before work started. As
all the student houses are built to
the same standard they are all
outside the regulations and the
local authority has the power to
inspect and obtain writs for all
the properties. Mr Clark said that
the local authority was being 'not
unreasonable', and no further
inspections appear to be planned.
The residents of number 66
Evelyn Gardens have delivered a
letter to the FELIX office, with
copies to Ian Bull and Michael
Arthur, Student Services Officer,
claiming that the Estates Section
was behaving in an 'arbitary and
unfeeling manner'. They have
not been informed of the move in
writing or told where they will be
moved to. The work, costing
many thousands of pounds for
this small part of Evelyn Gardens
alone, will start in March and last
until the summer, disrupting the
preparations for the summer
exams of other Willis Jackson
residents. Michael Arthur also
only found out about the work
last week, although he stresses
that all the students being moved
could be found places elsewhere.
The contravention of Housing
Regulations highlights the state
of the property in Evelyn
Gardens. A backlog of repairs
has built up, including dry rot,
tiles falling off walls, problems
with water heaters, leaking roofs,
and other major external repairs,
although Mr Peter Hallworth,
Managing Surveyor (Residence),
stressed that the structure of the
buildings was still basically
sound.
The Halls of Residence
Contents Insurance states that
the College must keep the
property 'in efficient condition
and good care' and take 'all
reasonable precautions to
prevent loss, damage injury or
accident'.
Mr Clark pointed out that his
Section is very short staffed. He
blamed the leaking roofs on dead
birds getting jammed in rain-
water guttering.
New video
The College has commissioned
two video films, one to attract
home and overseas students and
the other to obtain industrial
sponsors for research.
'Many universities are now
using video films to supplement
their prospectus', said a
representative of the company
making the films.
Budget
raised
The distribution of the Science
Budget for the next academic
year was announced last week in
the House of Commons by the
Education Secretary, Sir Keith
Joseph. The rise of nearly six
percent on last year's figures is
lower than expected, because
extra cash was needed to fund
student grants.
The Natural Environment and
Medical Research Councils have
been worst affected with
decreases in real terms. The
Science and Engineering
Research Council (SERC) like
the Economic and Social
Research Council have had their
allocations increased by a modest
six-and-three-quarters percent.
The SERC are delighted that they
are receiving more money
although the increase is seen as
inadequate. The extra cash will
be used to fund new top-quality,
or alpha-rated, university
projects. There is no indication of
an increase in the number of
studentships.
Rector ill
Lord Flowers was admitted to St
Stephen's Hospital on Tuesday
for tests.
The Rector, who has not been
well recently, is expected to be
away' for up to three weeks. He
will be convalescing out of
London, and members of the
College have been requested not
to write or telephone. His doctor
has ordered complete rest.
Professor Swanson, the Pro
Rector, will be undertaking the
Rector's duties during his
absence.
Flowers, 60, is leaving the
College this year to take up his
duties as Vice Chancellor of the
University of London.
Four members of the Computing Department recently took
first prize in the European Finals of the Association of
Computing Machinery (ACM) programming competition.
They will go on to take part in the World Finals in New
Orleans, USA on March 13. Pictured above are the team
with ACM officials.
