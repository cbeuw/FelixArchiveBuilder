SINGLES
Elvis and the Jordainaires:
Elvis Medley
50 years after Elvis' birth,
this is the most tasteless
commemorative single I have
ever been subjected to. The
only possible reason to buy it
is the B-side's original version
of 'Blue Suede Shoes'.
The Associates: Breakfast
There was a time when it
seemed the whole world
except me were in love with
'Party Fears 2' with this new
single it seems like most of the
world except me dislikes it. I
can't win! The piano playing is
luxuriously brilliant, and at
last, the vocals have stopped
grating. As a 'breakfast' this is
like croissants and coffee,
rather than toast and muesli â€”
Sunday morning music.
Rah Band: Are you Satisfied?
Ever since Matt Bianco
burst into the charts with a
unique brand of soul-jazzing
last year, other artists have
been trying to emulate their
success. A moody little piece
this one, a bit Radio 2, but /
like it. I find it best in bed with
dim lights and a glass of
chilled white wine. Try it!
Pointer Sisters: Neutron
Dance
Saw the excellent video of
this at the flicks last week (it's
advertising the new Eddie
Murphy movie). Ever since
then, my feet have been
tapping every time I hear it.
The fifth single from 'Break
Out' I find it quite incredible
they can release such
consistently high quality
product. Besides, I just love
those sultry voices.
Linda Ronstadt: Falling In
Love Again
Loathe as I am to admit to
liking the music of Ms
Ronstadt, this return to the
sound of the 20's from her
album 'Lush Life' and
featuring the Nelson Riddle
Orchestra, is simply superb.
Flipped with the vocally erotic
'Sophisticated Lady', this
single is three minutes of
undiluted mmmmmm.
H20: You take my Breath
Away
Can't wait to see the video
'cause the picture sleeve has a
photo of a break dancer, and I
just can't imagine break-
dancing to H20. Good song
though. Heavily over-
produced by Bob Sargent,
this could be the one to bring
the band back to the top of the
charts. Then again, it
probably won't!.
THE A TRE
Scrape off
the Black
'Scrape off the Black', by
Tunde Ikoli; Dir.: Alby James
at The Arts Theatre, Leicester
Sq. till 2 February and then the
Albany Empire (6-9 February).
'Scrape off the Black' is the
first play in the GLC's second
Black Theatre Season; a festival
that attempts to make the West
End audience aware of the talent
of black actors, writers and
directors involved in many of
Britain's fringe theatres. The
festival hopes to bring three new
productions together:
"Vigilantes', by Farruk Dhondy,
The New Hardware Store' by
Earl Lovelace, and, at present,
Tunde Ikoli's new play
performed by Temba Black
Theatre Company.
The play set in the mid 70's
concerns itself with the
problems faced by the half-caste
children of a mixed marriage in
the 50's both with regard to their
society, but more particularly
within the family unit. It deals
extensively with loneliness,
which none of the characters
can escape from. Trevor (Ben
Onwukwe) is the obvious victim
of emotional starvation ('Does
she love me? DO YOU?',
'Course I do, I'm your mother1
),
but the problem runs deeper
than that, as isolation is passed
from mother to son, from son to
grandson.
As an example of Black
Theatre, I sense the issue of
racial politics (which reached a
climax about this time) is used as
a means (rather than the end) to
focus on intense, but not
necessarily related family
problems. If the author had laid
the emphasis upon the subject
of illegitimacy, with an all black
or all white cast in mind, the
message in the play would still
have been as relevant.
This is no slur on the play of
course. Indeed, this is an
example of black theatre in
direct contrast to current trends
in the media (especially
television) to deal directly with
racial conflict: apartheid in
foreign countries, police
relations with minority groups.
The acting throughout is
excellent, particularly from Rose
(Catherine Terris), a pathetic
bingo addict and hypocondriac.
Whether the festival achieves its
aim remains to be seen, but
'Scrape off the Black' is certainly
going in the right direction.
