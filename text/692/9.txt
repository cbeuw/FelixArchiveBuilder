rCLUBS
PHOTOSOC
Competition
We should, I hope, be in receipt of one new
colour enlarger for the old darkroom, within
the next couple of weeks. When it does
arrive, lists will be posted on the Photosoc
noticeboards for both colour and black and
white demonstrations, as these had to be
cancelled last term.
This will also enable you to get on with
printing for the big competition. The main
contest will require a portfolio of three or
four (maximum four) of your best photos,
reflecting your diversity, artistic merit, orj
photographic skills (only one portfolio per
entrant). This is not a printing competition,
so print quality and printing techniques will
not be essential features. Obviously, they will
enhance the finished photo, through. Both
black and white, and colour prints (not
slides) will be considered, but black and
white preferred, as colour prints do not
reproduce very well, (a selection will be
printed in FELIX and Phoenix). Size is
unimportant, though again, larger prints
have a greater impact, generally.
The competition will be judged by a
committee (not the Photosoc committee),
and there will be prizes of £10 and £5
vouchers from Jessops, for first and second.
The test will also be printed in FELIX and
Phoenix. It is open to any Photosoc member,
and is an ideal way to enter your first
competition.
There will be a subsidiary competition on
the theme of 'Christmas' (which gives you
quite a wide scope, really). No prizes for this,
but the best will appear in FELIX or The
Phoenix. There are no rules — any size, any
colour. The closing date for both
competitions will be Friday 1 March.
SCI-FI SOC
I hurried down the darkened alleyway as I
heard the foul slurping noise as the creature
oozed its way around the corner.
Not far to go now, I was almost home. I
quicked my pace as I recalled the brief
glimpse of it I had when it first appeared.
God, I thought, a moments hesitation and it
would have got me for sure!
I rounded the last corner and almost
leaped up the steps as I got to the door,
grabbed my keys from my pocket, and
hurriedly opened it.
The door slammed behind me — safety at
last. With the danger now past, waves of
exhaustion overcame me and I collapsed to
the floor.
It was then that I heard that same slurping
sound which had persued me for the last
hour — the creature was outside. Suddenly I
was struck by the fact that I did not know
what this thing was, or why I was the object of
its, presumably, digestive desires.
But what...horror of horrors, something
was slipping under the door, and...what was
that dripping through the key hole?
I was rooted to the spot as this ooze
started to move, to change shape and colour,
to assume some recognisable form.
An arm, an eye, and then it was whole.
No, please God..at spoke!

t boring student by Finian
There are some really cynical
people in this world who
believe that students only go
to University to avoid getting
a job.
Let me tell you buddy! We
work damn hard at our
subjects — 1 bust a gut for
last week's exam y'know.
Solid twenty minutes
revision!

Sure I want a good job
eventually — responsibility,
the chance to work in a
team, something which offers
a stimulating mental
challenge...
...I also want a St Bernard
that can speak Swahili!
