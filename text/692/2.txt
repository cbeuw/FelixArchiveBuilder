Social apathy
Dear Sir,
We are writing to draw the attention of the
hall residents (Weeks, Tizard, Keogh and
Falmouth) about the apathy of their social
club chairmen none of whom could be
bothered to even acknowledge the formal
invitation, for an inter-hall tabletennis
tournament, sent to them by Linstead social
club chairman, sometime during the last
term.
Whether this is due to their inability to
cope with their duties or some unknown form
of inferiority complex (Linstead after all is
number one). We are going to place them in
the bottom of the league if there is no reply
within one week.
Sincerely yours

Dear Sir,
In last weeks issue of FELIX, Cathsoc
made an appeal for an end to the prevention
of terrorism act, in line with Sein Fein (IRA)
policy. Before the readers start writing to
their MP's as suggested by Cathsoc, I feel that
a few more points need to be considered.
Firstly, it should be remembered that one
of the main reasons for the acts existence is to
help protect the people of Northern Ireland
from the continual onslaught of violence
directed at them by the IRA, UVF, INLA and
all the other psychopaths who have plagued
the province for the last fifteen years.
Secondly, the people of Northern Ireland
have repeatedly endorsed this policy and
indeed have called for increased protection
against terrorists. I find it difficult to believe
that the government could be justified in
removing the small amount of protection
that has been granted so far.
Let no one be in any doubt that the
campaign against the prevention of terrorism
act is seen by the people of Northern Ireland
as a part of the wider camnpaign of violence
being waged against them.
Certainly a political solution must be
sought in Northern Ireland but whilst the
terrorists are still killing them the
government are obligated to protect the
people.
Having read this article you are urged to:-
1 Inform yourself (as widely as possible) on
the views of the people of Northern Ireland.
2 Write to your priest (or minister) asking
him to speak out against tacit support being
given to the terrorist by various 'concerned'
groups.
Yours faithfully

College
'out of touch'
Dear Sir,
Thank you for your coverage of the
abolition of the Joint Honours (Bio)
Chemistry/Management Science course. The
absurdity of this decision is unparalleled.
That the College Board of Studies has given
in to the Chemistry department shows how
out of touch College is from the outside
world, as well as current students. You only
have to read how College sells the joint
honours course in the 1985/6 IC prospectus
to see how ridiculous the Board of Studies
has been:
'The need for scientists to be well versed in
management techniques has become evident
in recent years. Surveys of graduates working
in industry and the public sector indicate that
many assume managerial responsibilities
relatively early in their careers, and even
those who remain scientists spend an
increasing amount of their time on
managerial functions...
...Comparisons of British science degrees
with those on the Continent show that
management subjects play an important part
in the curriculum of the courses in Europe.
Thus the need for management education is
now strongly emphasised by industry and
commerce as well as by government bodies'.
The real reason why the director of
undergraduate studies in Chemistry has
swapped the course is that when the twelve or
so students leave the Chemistry department
before the third year, the money the
department can claim from government
sources goes down. Elementary logic then
says, if you stop the students changing
departments, then the Chemistry department
can claim more (as government grants are
proportional to the number of third years)
and so it gets richer!
The claim that sutdents can just do an MSc
in Management Science if they are so inclined
is, as is widely known, not valid: Only 15% of
the MSc students in Management Science
have managed to get grants.
Hoping that this matter will be raised when
the UGC visits IC,
Yours sincerely,
John Hartz
Dept of Man Sci
FELIX
It has always been the platitude of the Estates
Section to say that 'the welfare of the students
is the prime consideration'.
The Estates Section, headed by Mr D W
Clark, is responsible for the maintenance of
the College buildings and halls of residence.
The Willis Jackson affair (see front page)
raises a number of important questions.
•Why did the Estates Section allow the
houses in Evelyn Gardens to deteriorate so
much in the first place?
• Why was Michael Arthur told only last
week that students must be re-housed, when
Estates knew eight months ago?
•Why will the work on Willis Jackson not
start until March 1985? Could it not have
been done over the Summer vacation in 1984?
•In what sense can the welfare of the
students be said to have been of prime
consideration when they are compelled to
move house during their exam revision?
I doubt that we shall ever know.
