Santa's Soup Run
Twas the night before Christmas—and Santa
Claus and his seven reindeer needed a
warming meal before setting out. Of course, as
flying crew, all eight had to have different
meals, so down in the kitchen elves Andy,
John, Stephen and Martin, the assistant
cooks, were preparing two soups each (which
for convenience they called No 1 and No 2).
The eight were asparagus soup, bee( broth,
cucumber, dandelion wine, egg, trench onion,
pea and haricot bean soup (but not

Having had you puzzling over the rather
simple problem of placing a number of
superkings (pieces that can move like both
a queen and a knight) on a chess board, I
shall now reveal the more difficult part of
that question. All that I want you to do, is
find the smallest n (n>1) such that n
superkings can be placed on an nxn board
so that none attack any other (although
they may, for the purpose of this puzzle, be
collinear).

John's No 1,' put in Andy. 'My No 2 is better
than John's No 1,' said Martin, who had to
have the last word.
The elves left poor Victor to sort this out,
but as they hadn't told him which flavours
they'd each cooked, he was really no better
off. Luckily Brian, the gnome who had the
unenviable task of teaching elves to read and
write appeared:
'I just met the elves playing snowballs,' Brian
said, dropping snow everywhere. 'John told
me that if you arrange the soups alphabetically
only one person has soups next to each other.
Andy said that where soups by one person are
next to each other, No 2 is before No 1. He
also said that the cucumber soup is not a No 2.
Stephen said John's No 2 comes directly after
Andy's No 2 in the alphabet, but Andy's No 2
does not come straight after Martin's No 1.
Martin concluded by saying that the beef broth
and the egg soup were made by different
people.'
'How does that help?' asked Victor, sighing.
'Well, dandelion wine soup is obviously the
best, and hariot bean the worst,' (Brian sniffed
the air.) 'You can work it out from there.'
Victor could too, but it took him so long that
he burnt the Christmas cake and the mince
pies—which goes to show that too many
broths spoil the cook!
What is the order of the soups, and who
cooked which? (Hint: gnomes always tell the
truth to the best of their ability.)
