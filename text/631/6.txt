FELIX PRESENTS:
Trial buUGM
A selection of old favourites from a hitherto unpublished Gilbert and Sullivan Opera.
Patter Song — UGM
Chairman
I am the very model of a credible sabbatical
I k n o w the constitution with precision mathematical
I chair all C o u n c i l meetings with efficiency that's
laudable
A t U G M s I shout till Stephen Goulder's barely audible
I wrote against F r a n k Rowsell and all those of his
mentality
A n d I compiled a wholesome book on sex and sexuality
Containings lots of useful facts on maladies venereal
(As if such things were prevalent in students at Imperial!)
I stoop to any level to maintain my popularity
I'll wear a silly turban to provoke some jocularity
In fact, as everyone agrees, and most are quite
emphatical
I am the very model of a credible sabbatical!
Ballad — The Captain
W h e n I was a lad I thought it cute
T o dress myself in a sailor suit
W h e n I played with friends it was such a prank
T o keel-haul them all and make them walk the plank
This kind of fun so suited me that now I have
become Domestic Secret'ry
A t school my maths I learned by heart
I stood and counted 'em to play my part
A s pencil monitor I stayed on the track
F o r I counted them out and I counted them back
A n d once I'd mastered num'racy I knew I could become
Domestic Secret'ry
A s a teenager I spent a night
O n a Sealink ferry to the Isle of Wight
I kept my dinner with a smile so brave
A n d decided on a life upon the ocean wave
The naval life so appealed to me that now I have
become Domestic Secret'ry
In the R o y a l N a v y I made my name
A n d Captain Lindley I soon became
But while on board I felt so green
They made me aide-de-camp to the Queen
F r o m aide-de-camp to H e r Majestee it's easy to become
Domestic Secret'ry
But aide-de-camp I found such a bore
They made me work hard from ten till four
So I drew on my store of limited knowledge
A n d the help of some buddies at Imperial College
W h o managed to pull some strings for me, so now I am
the p r o u d Domestic Secret'ry
N o w all your lads wherever you may be
If you want to rise to the top of the tree
W h e n you plan your career as you leave school
Be careful to be guided by the golden rule:
D o n ' t work at a desk, spend your life at sea,
A n d you all may become Domestic Secret'ry
Trio — President & 2 Students
President:
I am so proud if 1 allowed
Sabbatical pride to be i m guide
I'd volunteer right now and here
T o vindicate you for a month or two
Sabbatical pride must be denied
A n d so I've tried to move to Southside, Southside
First Student:
M y brain it teems with endless schemes
Both good and new for I C U
A n d if we split, the benefit
That we could gain is all in vain
So every man should try to ban
This reckless plan as best he can
Second Student:
I heard one day a gentleman say
That Unions who are cut in two
Are stuck for space, and so lose face
Despite your claims we'll not play games
W i t h you, since this is true I'm sorry for you
Without ado we bid you adieu.
Solo — Mr Smith
(the ex-Governor of the Gilbert & Sullivan islands)
If ever for some reason there's more housing to be found
I've got a little list
I've got a little list
O f bits of U n i o n Building that might well go underground
A n d that never would be missed
That never would be missed
There's the old refectory which no-one uses any more
There's the L o w e r Lounge, Graffitti and there's all the
second floor
The Dressing room, the Concert H a l l and all that
Dramsoc stuff
(The President suggested that and Aeseemed keen enough)
A n d committee rooms that house organisations feminist
(Societies like W I S T )
I'm sure they won't be missed.
Solo — Lady Mary
Dear friends, take pity on my lot, my cup is not of nectar
I long have loved (as who would not?) your kind and
charming Rector
L o n g years ago my love began so sweetly yet so sadly
N o w he's become a plain old man yet still I love as only I
can
Yes, still I love h i m madly
Y o u very, very plain old man I love, I love you madly
Y o u very plain old man I love you madly.
I k n o w not why I love h i m so, it is enchantment surely
He's dry and stuffy, deaf and slow, ill-tempered weak and
poorly
He's ugly and absurdly dressed and sixty seven nearly
He's everything that I detest, yet if the truth must be
confessed
I love him very dearly
Y o u ' r e everything that I detest, but still I love you dearly
You're all that I detest I love you dearly.
