Newsbi?ak strikes back with 4-D television.
Yes, after milliseconds of scientific research the
backroor.i boys have finally come out of the
closet, going one better than 1TV. F O U R
dimensions! That's x, y, z A N D t. For the first
time on television the structure of time is
revealed. December 16 is the date and 1:00
and 6:00pm are the times—the locations; as
ever, the residence sets and the J C R .
December 16, in case you haven't guessed,
is the date of the Christmas programme, the
usual collection of lunacy, sex, illegality and
Yuletide scandals. In the interests of public
decency we promise a programme free from
canned laughter and jokes about Mooney,
masons and College administrators, or at least
that's what the guv'nors tell us workers.
In the proper fashion, we end this column by
thanking Martin S Taylor for the kind donation
of this waste of space and wishing you a
goodnight from all us here in the T V Studio,
please remember to remove the plug from the
wall socket...white dot fades to centre of
screen...viewers are woken by 1kHz tone

With their pieces arranged against me, pawns
at my front, the evil Black Queen flanking me in
the dusk, the Knights snarling in the ever
thickening darkness I stumbled on through the
freezing snow towards the F E L I X Office, the
crumpled sheet of publicity clutched in my
hand.
Tears coursed down my face as the memory
of A n i t a ' s b l o o d y , s h a t t e r e d visage s w a m
before my eyes. If only I had been quicker I
could have put myself between him and her
fragile, soft body but...no, I had failed and now
battled on alone.
A black bishop appeared from the darken
doorway of the Bot/Zoo C o m m o n Room, lazer
in hand, its purple beam screaming through
the icy air. I dodged but it caught me in the
chest, my rib cage exploding in a million
droplets of scarlet that stained the virgin
snow.
The Black Queen screeched her victory to
the starry heavens, as her Pawns moved in for
the kill. There in the snow, torn shredded, lay
the paper—and on it I could just read, as my
eyes filmed over with the lethargy of death,
" O u r 83 films are:
Oh Lucky Man, Jan 18
Lord of the Rings, Feb 8
D r Strangelove, March 8."
The Black Bishop pocketed his laser, lifted
his foot and ground the paper into the snow,
saying as he did "So much for the S F Soc
article."

try.

Hello folks; 'So now the end is near, and so'
but there are major events to attend before
that. Today there is a U G M 1:00pm M e c h Eng
220; the publicity officer will be elected (not
ratified!) and the new even longer scarf will be
introduced. The same scarf will be used at
c a r o l singing this evening. T o those that
haven't been before this is when we travel to
the W e s t E n d , sing (?) c a r o l s , visit local
hostelries to soothe the vocal cords and return
to the union for mince pies and hot punch. But
this is all accomplished, except the pubs, tied
together on the one scarf, yes it is that long.
Meet 6:00-6:30pm Beit Q u a d / U n i o n Bar.
So see you (but will you see me), 1:00,
ME220.

For those of you who don't want to reform
Christmas, lettuce reassure you that this is no
more our intention than to take a bag full of
raisins and turn her into a Sultana...But talking
about our fourth coming party (Easter was the.
second coming), we are thinking of changing
some names and phrases: O u r pantomime
'Aladdin and the 40 Thieves' will be replaced
with 'Alfalfa and the faulty chefs'; a 'cold meat
s a l a d ' shall be called 'chilly con c a r n e ' ;
mousetraps shall be known as 'Rats-a-tuer',
and b o t h 'fast food' a n d prunes shall be
referred to as 'celeri'. So come to our party,
where you can look forward to a splendid meal
with relish (or tomato sauce if the relish isn't
O K ) . If you want a whole meal, you'd better
turn up early in case there isn't mushroom.
Y o u can come perhaps to pass an evening
pleasantly chatting (...do I detect a split P there
or was it perhaps a split infinitive?...).
"Hey, Paddy, will ya pasta food across?"
" E h , Pierre, parsley vegetables/
" O K , here's a pizza somethingorother..."
Renew old friendships
"I'm sure I soya at the Freshers' Fair "
"Yes, it's bean along time "
G r e g a r i o u s l y engage (ie greengage) in
intelligent conversation....
"That swede thinks Coleslow is the capital
of Cnorway "
o f . . . " . . . . i s n ' t B u g s B u n n y a n i n t e r e s t i n g
carroter."
...or even gossip.
"Hey, Shaemus, can you see, is that Annie
and Pieter?"
" N o , I don't tink it's Onion Pie tere at all, at
all." A n d extend invitations...you'll have to
come auber, Jean."
So make a date (or fig or plum) for the
r e n a m i n g party. E v e n A v o c a d o . F o r the
carnivorous, come and meat people. For the
rest, turn green (vegetarian) at the sight of
them, and rabbit or shout it for days. I bet you
can hardly wheat! (Cor, that one was corny!).
W e l l , there's food for thought, even if
written in apple-ingly bad taste. But I'm sure
youghurt the gist of it. So donut forget...rice to
the occasion...no? oh all right then, peas
yourself. Orange to be in the Union Dining Hall
(first f l o o r , U n i o n B u i l d i n g ) at 6 : 0 0 p m
t o m o r r o w ( W e d n e s d a y ) or ( H ) o m l e t t e
Gardens, S W 7 at any time suetable.

Thanks to everyone who helped to make
human rights week a success. It's hard to
make much impact at a place like IC, but every
little helps.
Next week we're having our Christmas
Party on Tuesday December 14 at 8:00pm in
the Bot/Zoo C o m m o n Room (25p to get in).
Everyone's welcome to come along, whether
it's to d i s c u s s T r o t s k y ' s part in the St
Petersburg Soviet or just for the booze. (We'll
have some beer, but please bring a bottle as
well). Merry Christmas.
