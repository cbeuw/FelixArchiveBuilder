Instructions
1. Get Mummy and Daddy to cut out the
Lindley-Dolly and all the clothes. You
may do it yourself ifyou are very careful
and use round-ended scissors.
2. Draw round Captain Lindley on a
piece of stiff card and stick him down
firmly; be careful to match up all the
little curly bits.
3. If you want you can make him stand
up by not cutting out anything between
his legs and slotting a piece of card-
board in the right place.
4. Now dress him up. Fold all the tabs
over carefully or the Captain's clothes
might fall off!
