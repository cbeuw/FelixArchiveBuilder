Opera Macabre
Le Grand Macabre by Gyorgy Ligeti,
English National Opera at the London
Coliseum. British premiere.
The opera which 'shocked and scandalised
Europe' when it was first performed in 1978 —
Le Grand Macabre - has finally hit London. Its
creator, the mischievous M r Ligeti, has struck
back.
G y o r g y L i g e t i is best k n o w n for his
Atmospheres, Requiem and Lux Aeterna,
those atmospheric pieces which were used to
such superb effect in Stanley Kubrick's 2001:
A Space Odyssey, but he is also the originator
of much more besides, music which, to say the
least, is bizarre. The performances of some of
his more eccentric pieces have entered the
annals of history. There was that infamous
concert in a newly-opened hall where the
platform was filled with metronomes, and
where musicians came on, wound them all up,
and then left, leaving the audience to watch
dozens of metronomes tick away until they
stopped. That concert caused the architect of
the hall to feel insulted and nearly resulted in a
writ. There was that choral piece devoid of
language which required the female singers to
shriek at the top of their voices for prolonged
periods. (An interesting man is M r Ligeti—full
of imagination). A n d there was that orchestral
piece where a tray laid out for a high tea was
p o m p o u s l y c r a s h e d onto the floor at an
appropriate point in the score, and which
r e d u c e d the audience to hysterics. Y e s ,
English National Opera has mounted one of
his works and M r Ligeti is back in town (or he
was a week ago Thursday).
P r o d u c e d by E l i j a h M o s h i n s k y a n d
c o n d u c t e d by E l g a r H o w a r t h , the E N O
production is crazy, comic and bizarre. The
stage is dominated by an enormous life-size
section of a piece of M 4 slipway, with the top of
a double decker bus on the one side and a
technologically tumble-down dwelling on the

other. The plot is absurd. A drunk city gent,
Piet the Pot (Roderic Keating) comes across a
pair of lovers, Miranda (Penelope Mackay) and
Amando (Jean Rigby), looking for a place
w h e r e they c a n m a k e l o v e . N e k r o t z a r
(Geoffrey Chard) enters as the driver of a
hearse claiming to be the figure of Death and
charged with the task of putting an end to the
w o r l d . H e forces Piet to help him in his
mission. In scene two, Astradamors (Dennis
Wicks) is engaged in masochistic love play
with his big-bottomed wife Mescalina (Ann
Howard). Mescalina implores Venus (Marilyn
Hill Smith) to give her a lover more potent than
Dennis Wicks as Astradamors and Ann Howard as Mescalina.
her husband, and Nekrotzar, entering with
Piet, responds to her appeal and kills her with
his violent l o v e - m a k i n g . The s e c o n d act
features the palace of Prince G o - G o , the end
of the world and much else besides (which, for
reasons of space, I am unable to describe).
If you think the plot is crazy, you ought to
listen to the music. To describe it is beyond my
power but it is definitely the music which
breathes life to the characters and the plot. Le
Grand Macabre is L i g e t i ' s e c c e n t r i c
tragicomical depiction of the last judgement—
the end of time. It is freely adapted from Michel
de Ghelderode's (1898-1962) La Balade due
Grand Macabre, a Belgian d r a m a t i s t . In
Ligeti's own words his work represents a 'very
c o l o u r f u l , c o m i c - s t r i p - l i k e m u s i c a l a n d
dramatic action...the characters and situations
(are) direct, terse, n o n - p s y c h o l o g i c a l a n d
s t a r t l i n g — t h e very opposite of " l i t e r a r y "
opera'. L e Grand Macabre is influenced by
Hieronymus Bosch and Lewis Carroll's Alice
in Wonderland, and although it is almost
surrealist in its absurdity it is not surrealist as
such because the action and thought behind
the opera is not divorced of reason or reality.
According to Ligeti 'Le Grand Macabre is our
present-day world, depicted on another level
of reality, on the level of absurd reality.' The
absurdity is death itself. In reality there is no
e x p e r i e n c e of d e a t h — n o t h i n g has b e e n
experienced but what has been lived. Death is
an illusion that never quite convinces us, but
fear is provided by the inexorable march of
time. 'Death and the whole dark future is of no
significance to us, there is only a here and
now.'
Ligeti's opera is totally unique and cannot be
c o m p a r e d with a n y t h i n g else. The E N O
production is one surprise from beginning to
end, and it holds one's attention magnificently
all t h e w a y t h r o u g h . T h e d e s i g n s a n d
accompanying action are extraordinary but
what makes the opera really go is the music. It
is difficult to criticise anything and trying to
criticise such a bizarre and unique work as this
is rather silly!
