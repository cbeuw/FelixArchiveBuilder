Gandhi
Gandhi (A) produced and directed by
Richard Attenborough is now showing
only at the Odeon, Leicester Square.
Fighting for notice in among the E T hype,
this film m a y have e s c a p e d y o u r notice.
Twenty years from conception to completion,
this is an epic in the grand tradition, except in
one major respect: the great man himself is
portrayed by a complete unknown; beset by
Columbia on one side, who wanted a star, and
the Indian government who wanted an Indian
to play the central role, Richard Attenborough
trusted his own judgement and gave Ben
Kingsley the role. The choice proved inspired;
M r Kingsley is half Indian and bears a striking
likeness, due in part to the strenuous efforts of
the make-up department, to Gandhi. This was
a difficult role to be handed as your first major
acting role; no praise is high enough for his
performance, he comes through with flying
colours and is utterly convincing.
In making this film, casting has not been the
only tightrope Attenborough has had to walk.
H o w do y o u m a k e a film s u c h as t h i s
entertaining, and a commercial success for
Columbia, and yet avoid offending the Indians
by portraying a man, virtually deified by the
Indians themselves, as anything less than
superhuman?
The political problems involved with making
a film of this size and scope, filmed on location,
with apparently no tricks in the crowd scenes
(they really had a million extras at the filming of
the funeral), means that the film tends to be
'safe'; neither Hindu nor Muslim is blamed for
the schisms of the independence years. Even
Nehru emerges with a pristine image, a man
apparently much admired by Attenborough,
w h o c o n s t a n t l y e n c o u r a g e d h i m d u r i n g
p r o d u c t i o n difficulties, p e r h a p s to try to
salvage a rather tarnished image?
There are also some interesting history
lessons to be learnt, some of questionable
accuracy. I'm afraid the old Raj doesn't come
off very well either, seeming to consist of either
sadistic, callous butchers, or inept corrupt
politicians. The rosy picture created by our
history books of a few isolated revolts followed
by a skilful agreement between Mountbatten
and the Indians leading to swift and secure
independence, is rather swept aside. Instead,
Gandhi is brought centre stage, the other
c h a r a c t e r s r e d u c e d t o m e r e p u p p e t s
responding to his guidance.
This film seeks to portray Gandhi as by far
the most important figure in Indian politics of
the time; my knowledge of Indian history is not
profound enough to be able to judge. A l l that
apart, it is still a sumptuously splendid film, and
gets us near as any film can to the man. Since,
probably it is his personal example and his
writing rather than what he did in the life of his
nation that gave him his influence, it works
well. He was in many ways the conscience of
the Indian people.
T h e film is without d o u b t , an uplifting
experience. This man's belief was unshakable,
his energy endless and he pursued truth in his
public and private life with utmost tenacity. It is
the story of the small man, the humble man;
armed only with tolerance and kindness he
took on the power of the empire. It makes you
believe in the power of the individual. H e is
portrayed as a good man, not a divine being.

effectively than any man since, due to his
unreserved condemnation of violent acts on
his behalf. H e proved that all Christian tyrants
have a weak spot. They must prove they have
moral ascendancy over the 'pack of savages'

they rule. Disprove that, and you have robbed
them of their right to rule. Prove you are their
moral superior and they will walk out of your
country with their head hung low.
If the choice of the central role was curious
the choice of supporting cast shows an eye for
the box office. The Raj is represented by those
most British of actors Edward Fox and John
Gielgud, both doing their best to look confused
and angry as the little man runs rings round
t h e m , w h i l e C a n d i c e B e r g e n a n d Ian
Charleson (of Chariots of Fire fame) play his
'disciples'.
Curiously, Gandhi's death to a fanatic's
bullet is repeated; shown once at the beginning
E T.
ET, The Extra-Terrestrial. Produced and
directed by Steven Spielberg, showing
just about bloody everywhere.
A s I stare at this blank piece of paper, I try to
think of something original, witty and incisive
to say of a film about which more verbage has
been expanded than on probably any other
film in history. So what is so special about two
thousand meters or so of celluloid that appear
to h a v e h a d a n i m p a c t as p r o f o u n d as
Watergate or Vietnam on American society,
and as much media coverage? W h y , before
the film left the States had it become the box
office number one of all time? Why, despite
pirate videos and marketing cock-ups of awe-
inspiring quality, do UIP executives look to this
film to set their whole operation in this country
back on its feet and keep them in gin and tonic
for the next decade? Perhaps the answer was
in the faces I saw leaving the cinema through
my own somewhat glazed eyes, of press-hacks
smiling sheepish grins on tear-stained faces,
people who hadn't shed tears at a film since
they wept in Bambi when they were ten years
old.
Without doubt, Spielberg has made the
ultimate tear jerker. It is a story of love. Unlike
Gone With The Wind, it is pure love, untainted
by lust and jealousy, as only a kids film can be.
It is, after all, a kids' film, a point emphasised
by the kids-eye-view filming angle employed
throughout.
The morals are simple: all children are good
or at worst misguided, grown-ups either don't
understand or are plain evil. But good, in the
end, will always triumph over evil.
The extra-terrestrial is abandoned when his
fellow travellers to earth beat a hasty retreat,
where they receive a distinctly unfavourable
reception from the powers that be; perhaps
they couldn't play the trombone very well or
just couldn't be bothered with all the red tape.
He takes refuge in a back yard in that familiar
Spielberg stamping ground of middle class
and once at the end, although from different
viewpoints, just in case after three hours of fast
and furious action you had forgotten. This
feels strange; you feel as if you've been in one
of those notorious Hollywood flashbacks, and
the star is just about to say "so you see, doc,
that's how I ended up with all these bullet
holes". But this is a small point in this work
which does justice to a man without office or
title, w e a l t h or g r e e d , without w h o m the
history troubled subcontinent might have been
very different; where even today a certain
rather ruthless politician (although she is no
relation) can use his name to justify acts the
Mahatma would have condemned.
surburbia. Elliott, a kid hung up about his
parents' marital problems and life in general,
finds and befriends E T , and that's all you get
from me.
There is no pretence at 'serious' science
fiction as in Close Encounters; indeed there
are a few pot shots taken at the sacred cow of
'scientific' science fiction in this film; this is
simply a film about the emotions of a small
rather mixed up kid, and a 'thing'. Walt Disney
would have used a dog or a fluffy white rabbit,
but we've moved on; the eighties want aliens.
With this film, the state of the art in models
has taken a further quantum leap. F r o m now
on, models will have to be criticised for acting
ability and charateristation and it is hard to
believe that E T isn't some midget in a wrinkly
costume. A s for the human cast, there is little
to fault; they are somewhat swamped by the
models and the special effects, but they all
manage to come over well, especially Henry
Thomas as Elliott; in one scene he has to be
grief stricken and seconds later 'act' grief
stricken, not an easy trick to do convincingly.
Despite the fact that criticising the holy
S p i e l b e r g is the sort of thing they w o u l d
probably, in less enlightened times, hack off
various limbs for, may I make a litte point
(please) ? In this and the last film he was
involved in, Poltergeist, Spielberg has made a
double ending. Y o u almost feel he has gone
away to the cutting room, happy that the film is
"in the can", and then panics when he has
edited it down to an hour and decides he'd
better go out and shoot some more.
Y o u are left there, hanging, after the first
climax waiting for the credits to roll and the
theme music to swell as gradually it dawns on
you that there is more to come. Still, the extra
bit is worth the readjustment as Spielberg
tightens the screw another turn, and drains
you of your last drop of emotion. By no means
a great film, but a piece of pure entertainment
which I'm sure will drag even the diehards
kicking and screaming from their T V and easy
chair into the cold winter evenings.
