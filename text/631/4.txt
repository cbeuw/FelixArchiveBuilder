Prof Privilege
Dear Editor
I have read your note on the
lecture by Emeritus Professor
L o r d K a l d o r which will take
p l a c e at 1330h on T h u r s d a y
December 9, on the subject of
Britain and the E E C .
I was interested in your view
that the speakers in this series
were unimportant. I was under
the impression that Professor
L o r d K a l d o r was one of the
most famous economists in the
w o r l d , and that his views on the
E E C c o m m a n d an international
audience. Indeed, I thought that
Imperial College was privileged
to have h i m as speaker on this
subject. I bow to your superior
knowledge however. I wish I had
the confidence to be E d i t o r of
F E L I X !

Dear Martin
Just a quick moan in keeping
with the approaching season of
peace on earth and g o o d will
towards all people.
Last week I C C N D G r o u p
displayed an exhibition in the
Sherfield Foyer, which outlined
some of the fallacies of C i v i l
D e f e n c e . T h e p o s t e r s w e r e
scribbled on with all sorts of
g r a f f i t t i , i n c l u d i n g C O M M I E
B A S T A R D S scrawled above a
picture of babies born deformed
and dead after H i r o s h i m a and
Nagasaki. (I'm not absolutely
certain, but I don't think the
communists were involved in
the w a r b e t w e e n J a p a n a n d
America.)
That is not the real complaint
(it is not unexpected at Imperial
C o l l e g e ) a l t h o u g h the set of
p o s t e r s c o s t us £ 1 5 . M o r e
terrible still is that the posters
now . have disappeared! Where
can they be? W h a t is to be done?

Dear Sir
F o r some years it has been
D r a m s o c policy to distribute, to
each of the College media, a pair
o f c o m p l e m e n t a r y t i c k e t s to
eachof our plays. S T O I C and I C
R a d i o are i n v a r i a b l y h e l p f u l ,
I C O N usually printed a review.
Last year F E L I X did not review
any of our shows. So far this
term we have done two plays.
The first, Covent Garden Trag-
edy, recevied a review (hooray!),
w h i c h was a p p r o x i m a t e l y six
lines long and contained several
factual inaccuracies which could
have been avoided if the reviewer
had read the programme. The
reviewer turned up to Butley, the
second production, but all that
was printed in F E L I X was a
solitary photograph.
F E L I X , this year, has always
contained at least a side of West
E n d and film reviews. W h y not
o u r s ? P e r h a p s y o u s h o u l d
institute a system of reporting on
f o o t b a l l l e a g u e a n d c o u n t y
r u g b y m a t c h e s , or d r o p p i n g
U G M reports in favour of news
r e p o r t s o n p a r l i a m e n t a r y de-'
bates.

We would send a theatre critic to
your production if you would
resume your practice of sending
us review tickets; do you think
FELIX staff are going to pay to
see your offerings? Still, season
of goodwill and all that, so we've
done a favourable review of
Rosencrantz for only half our
normal fee. Merry Christmas-

Dear Editor
(I have been instructed by the
c o m m i t t e e o f t h e I C B S to
forward this letter to you.)
I was surprised, no disgusted,
that the last financial year did
not yield a substantial increase
in funds to our society.
A s t h i s i n d e e d is a w e l l
established society that caters
for the furtherance of academic
qualifications, we justly expected
a substantial grant for expanding
facilities.
Our letter requesting financial
a i d w a s s u b m i t t e d o n t h e
3 1 / 3 / 8 2 after which we did not
even receive acknowledgement.
Obviously this is yet another
e x a m p l e of I C U n i o n i n e f f i -
ciency. W e wonder if y o u could
question M r G o u l d e r on this
matter.
Yours in anticipation

Hellenic Rights
Dear Sir
The Hellenic Society is or-
g a n i s i n g a f i l m a n d t a l k o n
Thursday December 9, jointly
with the I C C y p r i o t Society and
Friends of Palestine. This fact
was submitted on time, both to
the F E L I X Office for insertion
in the What's O n c o l u m n , and
to J o n S t a n l e y , the H u m a n
Rights Week coordinator. T w o
questions arise:
a) W h y , in the What's O n
c o l u m n , was the event publicised
as being only due to Friends of
Palestine?
b) W h y was the event omitted
e n t i r e l y f r o m J o n S t a n l e y ' s
article in the same F E L I X ?
Answers to these two questions
w o u l d be most welcome.
Yours sincerely
M K o m o n d o u r o s
Secretary, Hellenic Society
a) The event was originally
organised by Friends of Palestine,
but changed to a joint or misa-
tin with Hellenic Society when the
Union prevented FoP booking
rooms as a Union Society.
b) Dunno; ask Jon Stanley

Flat Refusal
Dear Martin,
I w o u l d like through the pages
o f y o u r esteemed j o u r n a l to
e n q u i r e as to w h e t h e r o t h e r
students in this college find that
t h e i r f l a t - m a t e s are n o t o n l y
incapable of washing-up effect-
ively (ie cleaning the pots), but
also only attempt to do so at
intervals of a r o u n d 6 months?
O r are we alone in this problem?
Yours sincerely

SUMMER JOBS
During the summer vacation, Evelyn Gardens, Hamlet Gardens and
the Fremantle Hotel will be turned over to outside lettings under
student management.
The schemes generate a number of summer jobs from high powered
entrepreneurial managers through to cleaning staff. Reasonable
wages and bonuses are paid and accommodation is provided.
This year, most of the pre-booking will be done through Student
Services. Overseas students—especially from Europe—are being
sought to translate advertising material into their own languages and
advise on advertising locations.
The Fremantle offers exciting prospects as it is envisaged that a
student run bed and breakfast scheme will be in operation.
If you are interested in any aspects of this, look out for the
recruiting ads next term or go and see Michael Arthur in
Student Services for further details.
