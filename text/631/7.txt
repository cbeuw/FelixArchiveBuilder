Trio — The Exec
All:
Three little Exec fools are we
A l l quite as happy as can be
D o n ' t give a d a m n for democracee—ee
Three little Exec fools
First fool:
One little fool is a pompous berk
L o o k i n g for jobs that he can shirk
A n y excuse for a year off work
Three little Exec fools!
All:
Three little fools all useless, very
N o w we're elected let's make merry
Pissed as a newt on U n i o n sherry
Three little Exec fools!
Second fool:
T w o little fools are important men
We've got the power till G o d knows when
As long as it's cleared with Auntie Jen
Three little Exec fools!
All:
Three little fools who all unwary
Think we can last till January
We've got it made now we've sacked M a r y
Three little Exec fools,
Three little Exec fools!
Solo — The Professor of Bray
W h e n in my jolly postgrad days
•My work went all to pieces
I took some other chap's results
A n d so wrote up my thesis
But this is the law I will uphold
A n d none may interfere, Sir,
That whatsoe'er the facts may be
I'll boost my own career, Sir,
W h e n my P h D was safe in hand
Success became my passion
So I slipped off to the U S A
T o learn the latest fashion.
But this etc.
This golden rule I swiftly learnt,
A n d made my fruitful practice:
Tell people what they want to hear—
T o H e l l with what the fact is
But this etc
So in each Sunday supplement,
I called their wishes Knowledge,
A n d soon contrived to get myself
A fellow of a college
But this etc
A paperback I next supplied
with trendy stuff unstinted
A n d subtly slipped the contrary
in footnotes finely printed
But this etc.
M y due reward in time arrived
So I'm the p r o u d possessor
O f a chair, distinguished and renowned,
A n d the title of 'Professor'
But this etc.
No thought of truth of facts shall e'er
Constrain me or condition
The books and papers that I write
T o further my ambition
But this etc.
Finale — The Company
W h e n the little bluebell at the bottom of the dell starts to
ring ' D i n g , ding',
W h e n the little bluebird who has never said a w o r d
starts to sing 'Spring, spring',
W h e n the little blue clerk sitting merry at his work starts
a tune to the m o o n in the night
It is nature, 'tis true, simply telling us to do what's right.
A n d that's why
Birds do it, bees do it,
E v e n folks with P h D s do it,
F r o m what I heard you do it too;
We k n o w that cows do it, swine do it,
People say they've seen N i c k Pyne do it,
(Somehow I doubt that that's true.)
N o w blowfish do it in the coral
Lovers do it after they quarrel
M a r k A l d e r t o n thinks it's i m m o r a l
If you don't have pills then you gotta do it oral
Postgrads, they say, do it,
Ladies in the Institut Francais do it
Hey, why don't we do it too?
M i r scheint daC
Ochs macht es, K u h macht es,
Ein gesundes K a n g u r u h macht es,
T u d u es, sei mal verliebt;
E i n E s k i m o ohne Licht macht es,
Furstenmtitter mit der G i c h t macht es,
T u du es, sei mal verliebt;
E i n K r o k o d i l tief im N i l macht es,
A u c h i m Reptilerei
Hasen auf Rasen so-
fort wie Prinzessin D i
E i n jener Goldfisch i m G l a s macht es,
E i n Student'nausflug i m G r a s macht es,
SpaC macht es, sei mal verliebt!
The ancient
Brits round Stonehenge do it,
Lots of students in C i v E n g do it,
We know it, oh yes it's true;
They say that hypnotists voo-doo it
It's more magical when you do it,
That's what I'm told you like to do;
We were in K e o g h , and we o-
verheard astonishing shrieks
A l t h o u g h D o n M o n r o says "that
He's not done it in Weeks
The girls in Beit when they're tight do it,
Even when they've sobered up they might
So tonight why don't ve do it too?
A n d what's more
M o n k s do it, punks do it,
Raving paralytic drunks do it,
A n d I can see quite a few;
I have been told that Kate Bush does it,
Doesn't puzzle me that Scaramouche does it,
W h a t I'm saying is let's do it too;
E a c h slithy tove in the wabe does it
W i t h a fav'rite mome rath,
Barney M c C a b e does it
O n his own in the bath,
The works inspector does it,
The Rector does it
Captain L i n d l e y in Domestic Sector does it,
If I gotta do it, then I want to do it with you.
