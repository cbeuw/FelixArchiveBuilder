College Slams
Student Suspicion
on Southside Move
Imperial College will not survive
after the recession unless sports
facilities and student accommoda-
tion are dramatically extended,
according to College Secretary
John Smith. Mr Smith, the most
senior administrator at IC, was
addressing last Tuesday's Union
General Meeting on the subject of
the projected Southside move.
N o w that plans to build a
post-experience centre have been
s h e l v e d , he s a i d , t h e o n l y
pressure on space in the Beit
building (where the U n i o n is at
present) comes from the Life
Science departments, which are
the least well-housed in College.
However, there are no immediate
plans to move existing U n i o n
facilities from Beit, but only to
extend them by using the vast
empy area under the Southside
Halls of Residence. In return,
College might ask for some of
the rooms in Beit for the Biology
department in a few years' time.
M r Smith hopes that in the
long term Life Sciences will have
a new building on the site of the
old R C S block, which will be
demolished once the new chemis-
try department is finished—this
is u n l i k e l y to h a p p e n before
1988. H e then sees all of the Beit
building and Princes Gardens as
b e i n g g i v e n over e n t i r e l y to
student accommodation, U n i o n
and recreation. The best stu-
d e n t s , he c l a i m e d , are d i s -
couraged from coming to L o n d o n
by problems of accommodation
and poor sports facilities.
M r S m i t h e x p r e s s e d h i s
disappointment at the Union's
i n i t i a l s u s p i c i o n — h e h a s , he
said, no motives other than to
fill the expensive, heated spaces
on the lower levels of Southside.
He told the U G M that no action
w i l l be t a k e n w i t h o u t f a i r
negotiation, but that neither he
nor the students could commit
their successors to a particular
course of action.

addressing students about the
Southside move at last Tuesday's
UGM.
W h e n M r Smith had finished
answering questions from the
floor, a resolution to delegate
negotiations for 'the installation
of increased sports and recrea-
tional facilities and shop space in
Southside in consultation with
the major sub-committee chair-
men,' was passed unopposed.
Chelsea
Sit-in
Students at Chelsea College are
staging a sit-in this week as a
protest against the proposed
merger of their college with Kings
and QEC. At a Union General
Meeting on Thursday, a motion
was unanimously passed that the
registry, the Principal's office ami
the Administration Block should
be occupied from Monday until
Wednesday afternoon. The
protesters will then move to the
Senate House in Malet Street,
where the Senate of the University
of London will be meeting to
discuss the merger.
T h e C h e l s e a s t u d e n t s are
concerned that both their own
college council and the Senate
w i l l a p p r o v e the m e r g e r in
principle while draft proposals
are still vague. If this happens, it
is a l m o s t i n e v i t a b l e t h a t the
merger will go ahead, with the
student body having virtually no
say in the arrangments.
S t u d e n t r e p r e s e n t a t i o n on
both the Senate and Chelsea
College C o u n c i l is minimal, and
occupation is seen as the only
way of attracting the publicity
a n d s u p p o r t o f t h e l a r g e r
colleges.
