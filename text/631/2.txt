U G M Tells Goulder —
Go Jump in the Lake!
Last Tuesday's UGM lasted long enough to instruct Union President
Stephen Goulder to jump into the Round Pond as a demonstration
of his devotion to ICU. The long-awaited motions on the National
Union of Students and the consistency of toilet paper were not heard
before quorum was called, and will probably be resubmitted next year.
The President's report was
accepted after much discussion;
it included a recommendation to
accept proposals that the Bar
Sub-committee only should see
detailed bar accounts and a
report on the Students Services'
controversial 'Accommodation
Ladder' which introduces a rigid
pecking order for the allocation
of postgraduate places in H a l l —
cries of 'Sexist' from the back of
the Hall were not taken seriously.
The report on the Southside
Move was accepted after College
Secretary J o h n S m i t h had
answered questions from the
floor (see page 3).
Several procedural motions
later, standing orders (the rules
governing the conduct of UGMs)
were suspended so that an
emergency motion on Stephen
Goulder could be heard without
the Chairman's permission. Paul
Simion accused Mr Goulder of
pomposity and lack of loyalty to
the Union, and moved that the
President should be instructed to
leap into the Round Pond when
it next froze over, and should
have his wrists slapped by Nick
Pyne, the U G M Chairman.
Mr Goulder volubly opposed
the motion on the grounds that
he was not pompous, but agreed
to abide by the Union's instruc-
tions if M r Simion would jump
in with him. M r Simion agreed
and the motion was passed by an
overwhelming majority.
Several bye-law changes were
then discussed. Chairman Nick
Pyne had been mandated by
Council to put forward a motion
What, me pompous? - Stephen
Goulder shows his indignation
at Paul Simion's motion.
to abolish the Permanent Work-
ing Party of which he is a
member, on the grounds that it
is inefficient and little-used. The
motion was passed unopposed,
and if it is passed at a second
U G M it will be put before the
Governing Body.
Mr Pyne then proposed a bye-
law change to remove depart-
mental representatives from
Council, as their poor attendance
record had made several recent
Council meetings inquorate, and
their job did not make it neces-
sary for them to attend Council.
Peter Burt, the Life Sciences'
Dep Rep, opposed the motion
on the grounds that Dep Reps
are the only 'non-hacks' on
Council, that their attendance
record was little worse than that
of other Council members and
that it would be easier to lower
the Council quorum than to
remove the D e p Reps. The
motion was defeated.
At this point the quroum was
challenged, and as the meeting
had been inquorate for over an
hour, it was closed.

night presented with a cheque and
a copy of Rupert Hall's book

jocular criticism over the past two

Fiona Grabbed
Miss Fiona Owen, the RCS Vice
President, was kidnapped from
her room in Linstead Flail at 8am
yesterday morning by students
from Queen Mary College.
Q M C S t u d e n t s ' U n i o n had
planned to keep Miss Owen
hostage until RCS returned their
stolen mascot, the yellow and
black leopard M a r y . Unfort-
unately for their plans Miss
Owen had to attend an import-
ant interview yesterday after-
noon, so at lunchtime she was
traded for another RCS official.
At the time of going to press it
was unclear who this would be,
although Andy Layton, Miss
Owen's boyfriend, had volunt-
eered.
