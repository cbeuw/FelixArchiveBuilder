Knight Errant's Puzzle
...so the witch gave the knight a new shield. "As well as
protecting you from all harm," she said, "this is the emblem of the
maid you seek. Ifyou are wise enough to decipher the meaning of
the designs you will discover her name, her occupation and her
birthdate. All four digits that you require are clearly displayed.
However, as you are of a mathematical turn of mind maybe I can
suggest a way that you can solve the riddle with your pocket
calculator
The first two sum to the second pear's product;
The latter sum is one and the difference two."
