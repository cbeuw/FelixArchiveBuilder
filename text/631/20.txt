R E V I E W S
Chaucer In
Monochrome
The Canterbury Pilgrims by Dyson
Imperial College Choir
The concert was taken up by a single work,
The Canterbury Pilgrims by the English
composer and teacher Dr Dyson. It is a setting
for chorus, three soloists and orchestra of a
substantial part of the Prologue to Chaucer's
Canterbury Tales, the text partially modern-
ised from the fourteenth century original.
The Prologue, after some scene-setting,
portrays a collection of pilgrims on their way to
the s h r i n e of St T h o m a s a B e c k e t at
Canterbury. Chaucer is not over-kind to his
p i l g r i m s , for i n s t a n c e the m o n k is a n
extravagant hedonist, the doctor avaricious
and the prioress preoccupied with courtly
niceties.
This side of Chaucer's poetry is largely lost
in the setting, the portraits are in mono-
chrome—we simply have mysterious music for
the astrologist doctor and the M G M angels
chorus for the prioress who feeds her pets on
choicest fare.
Another problem with the setting is that
there is just too much text, the word-sheet
alone was twelve pages long. The effect of this
is that the audience has to spend the entire
• concert staring at the words lest they lose their
place.
The musical idiom is very much that of
earlier V a u g h a n W i l l i a m s , several of the
passages are very reminiscent of the Sea
S y m p h o n y . H o w e v e r , D y s o n l a c k s the
courage of his conviction and at the top of a
crescendo, rather than opening out into the
strong broad melodies characteristic of that
work, he lets the opportunity slip bv. The
same applies to his attempts to build tension;
j u s t as t h e m u s i c b e g i n s to e x c i t e he
introduces some inconsequential figure and
everything collapses. The piece would require
considerably more than Eric Brown's slightly
flaccid conducting even to begin to come to
life.
In spite of the drawbacks of the composition,
the m e m b e r s of the choir were evidently
enjoying ti.°mselves. The solidity of their
opening p h r i s e s , after the unimpressively
c h a o t i c o r c h e s t r a l i n t r o d u c t i o n c l e a r l y
established the choir as the better-disciplined
body. O n the whole, intonation and diction
were good and they made the most of any
opportunity for exuberant display. Apart from
a couple of weak entries, the only noticeable
lack of confidence occurred during the fugal
start to the C l e r k e of O x e n f o r d , not by
coincidence the furthest that the vocal parts
strayed from conventional harmonic writing.
It was in the more contrapuntal sections that
the poor balance was particularly evident. This
was partly the fault of the conductor who
could have done much more to bring out the
different lines. The real problem, however, was
in the stodgy and unimaginative orchestration.
Fine though the brass playing was (the
woodwind too) it was wearisome to listen to
the whole overpowering section at almost
every possible forte. The woodwind writing
was cliched as well, with far too many pastoral
oboes and twittering flutes.
The use of quality soloists in a piece such as
this is, of course, mandatory, and in this case
their contribution was suitably professional.
H o w e v e r it did not seem that the w o r k
aroused their interest and it was .only the
soprano Elizabeth Ritchie, who, in the Wife of
Bath, showed any enthusiasm.
The choice of so pedestrian a work is a little
surprising. Many of the choir have at most
three years of membership. Surely, given the
vast repertory of excellent choral music that
exists to be explored, it is a shame to waste a
whole term on, this piece. Experimentation is
an excellent principle, but unless it be in small
d o s e s , it d o e s n o t a l w a y s a d v a n c e a
composer's cause.

Feast of Music
Overture to the Magic Flute, Mozart
Clarinet Concerto No 1, Weber
The Planet Suite, Hoist
Imperial College Symphony Orchestra
T h e a u d i e n c e at the I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e
Symphony Orchestra concert on Friday were
treated to a feast of music of a very high
standard. U n d e r the d i r e c t i o n of R i c h a r d
Dickins, the orchestra has developed over the
past few years from a group of individual
musicians to a team Emlyn Hughes would be
proud of.
M o z a r t ' s overture to the M a g i c Flute
opened the concert which apart from the
occasional scrappy string playing was full of
d e l i g h t f u l c o n t r a s t s . A t t i m e s I felt the
orchestra were seated too far apart to be able
to keep together, but overall the music was as
light and energetic as Mozart demands.
The clarinet is a very popular instrument
with beginners, few of whom can even hope to
achieve the technical brilliance of David Fuest
in Weber's Clarinet Concert No. 1. This very
demanding piece was effortlessly played with
s o m e very m o v i n g passages in the slow
movement, and technical brilliance towards
the end. A small orchestra here accompanied
very sympathetically, particularly in the string
section, and achieved a very pleasing result.
For an amateur orchestra to attempt such a
difficult work as the Planet Suite by Hoist, is
always a gamble, but in this case it certainly
paid off. M a r s , the B r i n g e r of W a r was
p o w e r f u l l y p l a y e d , w i t h s o m e e x c e l l e n t
fortissimos and a strong rhythm throughout.
The orchestra now achieved good cohesion
and balance, previously lacking, helped by a
dynamic percussion section.
Venus, the Bringer of Peace was a complete
contrast, but not, I think, as Hoist intended.
The intonation was rather poor in places, and
the players were again just not together.
However the work improved from then on,
with Mercury being light and bright with some
lovely oboe solos.
I C S O obviously has no problems at all in
playing loud movements, and Jupiter was as
exciting as I've ever heard it. The central
theme was warmly played by the brass,
whereas the strings excelled with some
beautiful passages in the closing themes of
Saturn. Uranus the magician was not really
magical enough, but the closing movement,
Neptune, was excellent with a good perfor-
mance from the choir; but is closing the door
the proper way to achieve a diminuendo?

Slick and Amazing
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
Imperial College Dramatic Society
"What are you playing at?"
"Words...words, they're all we have to go on."
Thus spoke Rosencrantz and Guildenstern—
or was it the other way round? Even the charac-
ters themselves suffer from perpetual confusion
as to which is which. In any case, the lines sum up
T o m Stoppard's approach to writing plays. His
plays are full of sharp wit, plays on words, and
twisted logic. H e has a marvellous way of
making the lines flow smoothly from character
to character, at times so slickly that one loses
the sense in amazement at the fluidity of the
language.
The play concerns two minor characters
from Hamlet, and is a somewhat bizarre and
surreal exploration of what they are doing when
not directly involved in the action of that play.
Totally bewildered as to who they are, where
they come from, where they are going and why,
they drift along in perpetual confusion, their
actions determined by events in that other play.
This probably sounds very arty and boring, but
Stoppard makes the (non-)action sparkle with
humour and wit. His avowed intention was to
write a comedy, and he succeeded admirably.
T h e h u m o u r is very m u c h clever h u m o u r ,
rather than sidesplitting slapstick.
T h e p l a y r e s t s v e r y h e a v i l y o n t h e
performance of the two main c h a r a c t e r s .
F o r t u n a t e l y , b o t h J o n G u l l i v e r a n d D a v e
Simmons rose admirably to the task, giving very
convincing and well thought out performances.
They were matched by David Roberts, who
played the leader of the troupe of travelling
players. Together, the three of them carried
almost the entire two hours—not an easy task
at all. They were helped by the players, who
delivered a brilliantly funny slapstick dress
rehearsal of a play they were to perform for
Hamlet and the King, and who, although they
h a d little to s a y , c o n s i s t a n t l y p r o v i d e d
convincing background action. There were also
occasional contributions from members of the
court; most of the scenes, unfortunately, came
over as somewhat wooden.
The set design for the ship scene was simple
and effective. However, this struck a distinctly
odd note in comparison to the sets of Acts I and
II, which used simply a bare stage to represent a
clearing, a palace, and a harbour, with no props
or backcloth for any of them.
Still, all things considered, this was a well
acted and well produced version of a difficult
play, and was a very enjoyable and thought
provoking evening.
Finally, may I point out, in reply to Eric's letter
(elsewhere in this issue) that the point of
reviewing West End theatre is so that people
can make up their minds whether to go and see
the plays for themselves. By the time you read
this (and I am writing not half an hour after
seeing the play) the run will have finished, and
if you missed it you are too late. What I can
say, though, is that our home talent is worth
considering; go and see the next production.
