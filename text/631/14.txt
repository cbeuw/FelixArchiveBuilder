THE FELIX FESTIVE FOOD GUIDE
Walkabout Cooksee
turns her attention from visual to culinary arts with
the emphasis on participation
Walkabout-Looksee for this Christmas issue
of F E L I X will take you as far as a well stocked
kitchen and drinks cabinet. A s well as being
hooked on my regular dose of visual art I am
very greedy (!) and revel in all the traditional
Christmas fuss that surrounds holiday feasting
and b o o z i n g . F o r a n y despairing culture
v u l t u r e s — t a k e h e a r t — I shall review the
Treasures of Ancient Nigeria at the Royal
Academy in the first F E L I X of next term: it's
on until January 23, and highly recommended.

Mulled Wine
P u n c h e s , p o s s e t s , m u l l s , t o d d i e s a n d
grogs—all are good winter warmers on dark,
cold days, just the thing after a long, numbing
motorbike journey, a morning tobogganing or
as a morale booster on a gloomy, overcast
d a y . T h e y ' r e a l s o i d e a l f o r C h r i s t m a s
parties—they're great fun to make and give all
your guests at least one shared experience (!)
to help break the social ice.
In Anglo-Saxon and early English times a
'wassail' was a mulled, spiced drink made with
old ale and served at feasts. The word comes
from the N o r s e 'ves he ill * meaning 'good
h e a l t h ' . P u n c h , m a d e w i t h s p i r i t s , w a s
introduced from India in the 17th Century.
M a k i n g p u n c h was a high-society ritual,
carried out with much pomp and circum-
stance, and by Victorian times had become
strongly associated with Christmas.
M u l l s are basically sugared a n d spiced
wines, ales or ciders, usually diluted with water
and then laced with fortified wine, spirit or
liqueur. H e r e ' s m y recipe for the F E L I X
Glugg': it's a red wine mull, spiced and sugared
to taste...my taste—so try it and then adapt it
as you will. F E L I X Glugg will fill about a dozen
1
/t pint goblets.
Stud an orange with six cloves and bake it in
a moderate oven for half an hour. Boil a pint of
water with two tablespoonsful of castor sugar,
a small stick of cinnamon and a little grated
nutmeg. Bubble this gently for about fifteen
minutes, till all the sugar has dissolved. In
another pan gently heat one bottle of any fairly
robust, inexpensive red wine; supermarket
full-bodied Spanish will do very nicely. After all,
the mull derives its character from the spices
etc, so it seems a pity to 'waste' a fine wine on
it. G e t the wine to not-quite-simmering point,
but don't let it boil or you'll evaporate all the
alcohol! Remove it from the heat and add the
spiced boiling water and the baked orange. Stir
in a wineglass of an orange liqueur (Cointreau,
Grand Marnier or Curacao) and the same
quantity of brandy (again, supermarket home-
brand is fine). Ladle it into punch cups (small
china or glass mugs) and serve at once.
Mince Pies
There are several rather nice things about
mulled wine, not least of which is that it's a
perfect accompaniment to mince pies—which
is a very good excuse for making, and then
consuming, lots of mince pies! Most families
have a cherished recipe for mincemeat, a well
guarded secret handed from grandmother to
granddaughter...which is sexist, and grossly
unfair to each new generation of Christmas-
chefs! I therefore submit my own recipe for
mincemeat. It will fill up to three dozen mince
pies depending, obviously, on how big the
depressions in your baking tray are and how
full you like your pies.
Start with
4oz seeded raisins
4oz currants
2oz sultanas
2oz candied peel
and 1 large, peeled and cored apple.
Chop or mince these to produce a rough- or
smooth-textured mixture, as you prefer. In a
bowl, mix the fruit with
4oz shredded suet
4oz soft, brown sugar
2oz ground almonds
and 2 tablespoonsul of marmalade.
Grate the rind off a lemon and squeeze the
juice from it. A d d these to the mixture, and
also 1 teaspoon of mixed spice, a pinch of
nutmeg and two tablespoonsful of brandy. Mix
well till all is evenly amalgamated. Then cover
the bowl, or put the mincemeat in sealed jars,
till you want to use it. It keeps well for several
weeks in a cool place, and because of the
alcohol matures and improves!

Walkabout-Pastrycook
No one else's pastry is ever as good: 'pastry
like M u m makes it' reigns supreme. But it's
difficult to reproduce if you can't remember
exactly how M u m does make it. I like pastry
very light and very short—which means that it
melts in the mouth, but crumbles in the hand.
It needs to be made in a relaxed frame of mind
with a light hand...both of w h i c h c a n be
achieved with practice. If you're in a desperate
h u r r y , or d e s p e r a t e for M u m ' s p a s t r y ,
Waitrose sells frozen shortcrust pastry (which
I have not tried, so cannot vouch for) or, if you
ask her nicely and don't reverse the charges,
Mum might explain how she does it. However,
\NCim>itNrs
for fellow-enthusiasts, here's a Walkabout-
Pastrycook's version, which will make up to
two dozen mince pies, depending again on the
size of the pies.
8oz fine, plain flour
4oz soft butter
2 teaspoonfuls of icing sugar
1 large egg yolk or 1 very small egg
Mix the flour and sugar in a bowl. A d d the
soft butter and rub it into the flour lightly with
your fingertips. When the mixture is like soft
bread crumbs add the egg and use the blade of
a knife to mix till it begins to cling together.
Then press it into a ball and knead it just
enough to free the pasty from cracks. The less
the pastry is handled the lighter it will be, and
this also applies to rolling it out. Use the rolling
pin gently: roll the pastry out thinly (3-4mm) on
a lightly floured board and cut it into rounds
using different sized cutters (the lid should be
smaller than the base!). Put the bases in a well
buttered pie tray and spoon mincemeat into
them. Depending on how generous you are
there will be more or less left over for the next
batch...or for nibbling as you cook! Place the
lids on' the filled bases and brush the top of
each pie with a little milk if you like your pastry
shiny. Bake near the top of a hot oven (Gas 7,
425F) for about fifteen minutes, until golden
brown. Let them cool in the baking tray for a
few minutes and then transfer to a cooling
rack. Eat them hot or cold, but dust them with
icing sugar first.
Happy drinking, 'bon appetit', and Merry
Christmas.
