O N E O F T H E more convenient
fast f o o d r e s t a u r a n t s a r o u n d
College is Strikes in Gloucester
R o a d . G a s t r o p o d hasn't quite
got r o u n d t o r e v i e w i n g t h i s
pinnacle o f culinary excellence
yet, probably because so many
IC students have been banned
o n a c c o u n t o f t h e i r i n d u l -
gence with the relish tray. T h e
last time ex-Editor Steve M a r s h a l l
ate there he took great delight in
sitting near the door so that o n
completion o f his meal, before
he had received the bill, he a n d
his friends could leap up from
their table and be out o f the door
and halfway back to College
before the waiters could realise
that Steve h a d left payment for
the meal lying o n the table.
But it's the waiters themselves
that cause most amusement, and
who have led to the eating-house
nicknamed 'Strokes' by more
than a few. I realise there are
certain men i n this world w h o
speak i n a n affected manner,
who embellish their speech with
camp gestures a n d w h o wear
constrictively tight trousers—
but w h y do they a l l gather for
employment i n South K e n s i n g -
ton i n a restaurant which caters
f o r a m o r e - o r - l e s s n o r m a l
clientele? H o w much will the
public put up with before they
stop eating there? Already one
(heterosexual) friend is distinctly
wary o f the place since the time
in the company o f a male friend
he w a s g r e a t e d w i t h ' G o o d
evening, I like the new boy-
friend.'
But the most alarming incident
occurred o n a n occasion when
the I C O r c h e s t r a c o m m i t t e e
were eating there just before a
r e h e a r s a l . T i m J o n e s , t h e
chairman, was passing round
some holiday photographs while
they were waiting for the meal,
and as he d i d so, the company
became aware that one o f the
waiters was taking a more than
p a s s i n g i n t e r e s t i n t h e p r o -
c e e d i n g s , a n d w a s e v i d e n t l y
s t u d y i n g t h e p i c t u r e s q u i t e
carefully.
Eventually he seized a picture
of T i m from somebody, a n d
b e g a n t o s t u d y i t . T i m h a d
recently grown a splendid beard
very quickly, and so the photo-
g r a p h i c v e r s i o n w a s n o t a
particularly good likeness o f the
hirsute young m a n before h i m ,
but eventually the waiter noticed
the resemblance a n d compared
the two critically while the rest
o f t h e c o m m i t t e e w a i t e d i n
expectant silence. F i n a l l y he
addressed T i m directly 'This is
you, isn't it?' T i m managed a nod.
'Much more sexy without the
beard!' A n d he minced back to
the k i t c h e n l e a v i n g T i m a n d
f r i e n d s w i t h a m i x t u r e o f
a m u s e m e n t a n d s p e e c h l e s s
astonishment.
S I N C E G U I L D S G e n C o m have
forced F r a n k Rowsell to stop
pillorying N i c k Pyne i n Guild-
sheet, I suppose it falls to me to
tell o f his return from a partic-
u l a r l y e x t r a v a g a n t p a r t y last
week. H e was stopped by an
officer o f the law as he cycled his
inebriated way home a n d was
asked i f he realised how danger-
ous it is to cross a red traffic
light. L u c k i l y for N i c k he h a d
the presence o f mind not to let
o n t h a t i n h i s c o n d i t i o n he
hadn't seen the light at a l l , and
probably wouldn't recognise one
if he ran into i t ; he was let off
with a caution.
T o some extent it was his o w n
fault, for he was riding a tandem
on his o w n ; anything so eccent-
ric is bound to be queried by a
bored police patrol i n the early
hours o f the morning. A friend
who can ride a monocycle has
given u p using it i n the town
where he lives because every
policeman he passes stops h i m
and then tries to think o f a law
he's breaking.
But to return to inebriated
tandemists, I have often wonder-
ed what the law would do i f it
caught up with two people o n a
t a n d e m , t h e f r o n t o n e ( t h e
'captain') stone cold sober, a n d
the back one (the 'stoker', w h o
has considerable influence o n
steering and balance) paralytic.
It's c e r t a i n l y d a n g e r o u s , b u t
what law could they prosecute
under? Is either o f them drunk i n
charge o f a vehicle? O r w o u l d
the police revive the Victorian
charge o f cycling 'recklessly'?
