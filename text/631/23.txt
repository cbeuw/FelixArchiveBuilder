IC vs Esher 2nd X V 4-15
Unperturbed at playing in front
of a 1,000 seater stand occupied
by only five people a n d an
airedale terrier I C started
strongly, the pack playing well
against a much heavier and
(almost) uglier set of forwards.
They soon took the lead when
the centre Davies uncharacter-
istically scored an opportunist
interception try racing upfield
very much in the style made
famous this year by Phil Verity.
This temporary aberration
was however soon rectified when
the same player presented the
opposition with a gift try with a
wild pass of his own. IC came
back strongly but never realist-
ically looked like scoring again
and in the second half Esher
increased their lead with a
second goal and a penalty goal.
Despite a brief flourish at the
end when the opposition became
dazzled by the glare o f the
floodlights bouncing off the
balding heads of a few members
of the IC side, IC never threaten-
ed Esher's lead and went down
to another defeat by a club side.
Team: A / Thompson, O Miles,
A Davies, P Barker, R Flynn, P
Clarke, S Johns, C De Rohan, H
Bell, J Whittle, P Verity, A Ralph,

IC vs L S E 25-15
L S E l s t s , u n b e a t e n by a
London college all season, were
well trounced by an enormously
well organised and coordinated
IC side.
The forwards carried the side
through as usual with large
amounts of well won possession
being predictably wasted by an
uninspired set of backs! In the
first half a good, solid perfor-
mance looked likely to lead to a
big score: n u m e r o u s easily
bruised economists were unable
to w i t h s t a n d the constant
pressure imposed by our pack.
By half time, though, a displeased
captain saw no points advantage
gained and, anticipating another
disappointing result gave a
rousing team talk which inspired
the side to great things.
Much ball was won through
aggressive, if not unorthodox
ruckingâ€” some blond haired
planner, imprinting his teeth

marks in a sociologist's rear end.
To their credit the quarter
backs did disguise an abject lack
of talent with unstinting effort
and were partially redeemed by
Steve P h i l l i p s s c o r i n g the
winning try.
After feeling the chill wind up
his shorts more than usual Pete

IC vs Esher 4th X V 22-14
After a devastating first line out
where our small mingy for-
wards won good ball against the
6ft 3ins plus fatties of the
opposition the ball was open to
our superstar fullback, Symes,
who went through to score
under the posts. T h i s was
successfully converted by our
captain, Ricky "I don't want
anymore 6 X " Winsor. The speed
of our forwards won good ball
against the stronger opposition
and resulted in three more tries
two o f which were slotted
between the posts. Our wonder-
ful supporter, 'Big' Les, tried
jumping up and down to keep
warm and this was the cause of
M a r k S i m m o n d s ' try as the
tremors caused the ball to jump
into his hands as he was diving
into the corner. Symes scored his
second try and the other was
by (somebody, but the
author can't remember who).

we wandered merrily down to
the Rembrant Carvery, having
been retarded by Jonathan's

Everyone was totally over-
whelmed by the stunningly
attractive J u l i a , juxtaposed
admirably by Pauline's legs.
Meanwhile Gary was stunned
into silence by Karen's cool
sophistication, the Professor
compensating with lecherous
grins. F o l l o w i n g in Denis's
footsteps, Steve burbled a speech
of gargantuan p r o p o r t i o n s ,
c u l m i n a t i n g in an anecdote
concerning a woman's legs and a
chihuahua's, obviously appeal-
ing to a minority audience.
Mr Wood's pistol competition,
held on Wednesday December 1,
was predictably won by M r
Wood, after the application of
an u n u s u a l h a n d i c a p p i n g
system. The system worked by
decreasing everyones scores to
zero, then adding a multiple of
the number of letters in one's
name. Neill seemed to base his
shooting position on a con-
stipated, pregnant, giraffe to
match the trophy he awarded
himself. Luckily he did not have
it all his own way, narrowly
coming out on top after ex-
periencing stiff opposition from
Miss Julia Avery.

IC vs Q M C II 1-1
I awoke to find clothes strewn
on the floor and the taste of stale
beer in my mouth. Inside my
head someone was digging-up a
road. M y memory returned
slowly. He summons from 'Big
Bad John' and his confirming it
as ' o n ' . The meeting in that
bleak room in S W 7 and the
journey to that place near the
airport where we always went at
times like these.
We had all felt good, the
rehearsal a week earlier had
gone off without a hitch, yet, in
the back of our minds, the
nagging feeling that this would
be different. At the appointed
time we took up our positions
and waited for the signal from
the 'man in black'.

Once again we began our
operation without a recognised
hit man and a lightweight up
front duo. Our four schemers
found it difficult therefore to
create clear openings and our
rearguard were often under
pressure, however, just before
the end of phase one; Rimmer
got one. If only phase two, the
retreat, had gone as it should,
but also we were caught out and
in the end retired miserably
shaken to drown our sorrows.
Back at our bleak H Q in SW7,
we split up, each one disappear-
ing into the London night but all
knowing that sooner or later Big
Bad John would summon us to
his aid once again and that none
of us dare not heed that call.
