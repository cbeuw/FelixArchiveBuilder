An ideal puzzle to try on your pals at the building
site, on a demolition ground, or anywhere there
are five bricks you can use. The puzzle is simply to
pick up five bricks using one hand. The diagram
shows how to do it.
The next time someone asks vou to share an
apple with them, here's an amusing way of cutting
it in half. The first cut is made vertically half way
into the top of the apple; the second cut is made
similarly upward from the bottom but perpen-
dicular to the first. Finally, the two cuts are joined
by cuts made into the side of the apple from
diametrically opposite points on its 'equator'. It's
impossible to describe, so see the diagram for
what each half looks like.
In the bar, take an ordinary baby's rubber teat and
before anyone can ask why you have such a thing
with you, bet someone they can't pour the entire
contents of a bottle of tonic water into the teat.
When they give up, tie the teat to the neck of the
bottle with a bit of string, block the hole with a
matchstick, turn the whole lot upside down and
shake it. The fizz from the tonic water will inflate
the teat to such a size as will comfortably
accommodate all the liquid. Now ask yourself if it
was worth it
Outdoors? Try locking your friend to a lamp post
or a tree (parking meters are too thin). If you wrap
your legs round a tree as shown in the picture and
then sit down, your.own body weight makes it
very difficult (and if you're unfit, impossible) to
stand up without being helped. Other entertaining
acrobatics include climbing to a standing position
on top of a parking meter. O r you could try
walking along the narrow sloping ledge two feet
from the ground on the Prince Consort Road side
of the Union Building.
