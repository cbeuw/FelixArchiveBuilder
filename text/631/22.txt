A f t e r a s o m e w h a t c o l o u r f u l
party the night before, and a
l o n g e x c u r s i o n t h r o u g h the
streets of Reading looking for
the river Thames, the team, in
high spirits and a clear state of
mind, finally managed to locate
Reading University Sailing Club.
E v e n m o r e p r o b l e m s were
e n c o u n t e r e d by the I m p e r i a l
team when trying to determine
the wind direction at the start of
the first race, leaving Reading to
make a fine start and keep First
and Second places until the final
mark. A t this point, the superior
s k i l l s o f the I m p e r i a l t e a m
mastered the wind flow around
the two gasometers on the river
bank and they stormed past to
take the race, f i n i s h i n g first,
third and fourth.
With cries of " M y extension
has fallen off" during the second
leg of the final race, Dave made
a dynamic dash for the bank to
try and get someone to help him
fix it. Unfortunately the Reading
ladies were not too sympathetic
and left Dave to his own devices
(and a screwdriver). This left
Peter and G r a h a m without a
team mate for the rest of the
race. Peter made gallant efforts
to try and slow the Reading
boats w h i l e G r a h a m decided
that the gasometers were really
too much to handle and waited
on the river bank to join in again
on the second lap. Unfortunately
Reading, still being harrassed by
Peter " a l l of them overtook m e "
Howarth noticed that G r a h a m
had actually sailed one lap less
than they had, and left Imperial
to concede the match.

Ten Pin Bowling
Last Saturday, the masses set off
for Portsmouth to do battle with
the local polytechnic. A g a i n , the
popularity of local pubs and
f i s h ' n ' c h i p shops p r o v e d too
much for some people, as a little
lubrication was sought before
the game.
However, as things got going,
it was obvious that, as usual, the
A team would overcome the
opposition thanks to 500+ series
by Michael and A n d y holding
their end up with a 502 series but •
everybody else bowling below
average. In the C team, they
were trunced with only M a r k

Wells (Club Captain, contact via
Chem E n g letter-racks!) putting
in a reasonable score. A s usual,
we couldn't raise a full ladies'
team so, if there are any ladies
out there who have Wednesday
afternoons free, come to a fun-
packed bowling session, com-
plete with novelty, prizes and
thrills.

fact that W i m b l e d o n Y M C A
was mercilessly ground to dust
two Saturdays ago, and there
you have the most improbable
set of events since both Sylvana
and I passed our finals last year.
(When I were a lad...) Statistical
theory dictates that one of these
days we're going to get the great
grandaddy of all thrashings, I
suppose.

So the team marches towards

First the good news: since I last

Football
F E L I X Score
Two
The F E L I X staff showed what
an adaptable lot they are on
Sunday in Hyde Park, taking to
football like a duck to orange
sauce.
F r o m the moment the first
whistle blew F E L I X made an
incisive break with a run down
the centre and a goal by Peter
Rodgers. So 1-0 up after thirty
seconds. Ents were obviously
baffled by the form F E L I X were
producing and they took time to
settle down.
Not content on a 1-0 advan-
tage F E L I X p u s h e d f o r w a r d
r e l e n t l e s s l y — a t times l e a v i n g
t h e i r d e f e n c e e x p o s e d Steve
Goulder proved what a good
diplomat he is by not committing
himself at all. However, even
w i t h this defensive p r o b l e m .
F E L I X went into half-time with
two goals to their credit.
Recharged by the half-time
c h a m p a g n e a n d t e a m t a l k ,
F E L I X took to the field with a
n e w d e t e r m i n a t i o n . T h i n g s
didn't go quite as well in the
second half when a game of
c o n t a i n m e n t was seen to be
played. Ents played hard and
one of F E L I X ' s valuable defen-
ders, Pallab, was 'nobbled' by
the Ents desperate attackers.
F E L I X , were obviously getting
tired and in the last few minutes
they threw all they had into
defence and somehow survived
relatively unscathed to reflect on
missed opportunities and mis-
takes made.
T o sum up then. A good,
closely fought game with perhaps
Ents' being the better team, but
on the day it was F E L I X ' s two
goals that c o u n t e d . P e r h a p s
F E L I X were just lacking the
extra 'magic' that their absent
'number one' could provide.
