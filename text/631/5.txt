It's Christinas
Twenty four pages of F E L I X
plus an insert in three colours
must be something o f a record
among recent F E L I C E S , even
f o r the special C h r i s t m a s num-
ber, so I hope you're as pleased
with it as I am. Apologies to first
years who won't be as familiar as
the rest of you with the great
F E L I X tradition of Lindley-
baiting, but I felt the Captain
had taken enough of a thrashing
from my predecessors, so I have
let him off lightly until this issue.
I don't know how many jokes
F E L I X has made at Captain
Lindley's expense over the years;
I don't stand and count them,
and it's not my job to stand and
count them either. But there
were quite a lot, I can tell you.
The other thing which may
strike you as a bit odd is the
rather obvious space-filling
advertisements at the centre of
the newspaper, they are there
because at the last minute we
decided it would be a pity to
print on the back of the Lindley-
doll insert, since in places the
printing would show through,
and also because we didn't want
you to have to spoil F E L I X by
cutting it up. Late on Sunday
night, then, I decided to include
another page in F E L I X , and we
thus needed two more pages of
copy—quickly!
Odds and Sods
One of the functions of the
Editorial is that it's available as
a kind of dustbin for all the

Serious Bits
There are lots of serious bits I
was going to write, but on
reflection it seems better just to
give a sentence or two outlining
the topics I feel strongly about,
and then expand on them next
term when you're more likely to
take them to heart.
Southside security: It seems
bonkers to me that the halls of
residence are locked at 1900h,
yet open at 0500h; anyone who
has a mind to could, say, wander
in and kidnap a vice president,
or worse.
The new refectory: how
thoughtful to provide unbreak-
able plastic plates for us clumsy
students; but don't do what I did
and bring the whole place into
confusion by asking for a drink
of water with your meal.
Harlington gravel: can it be
true that College and the Union
have actually organised some-
thing to their mutual benefit
without violent disagreement?
Also in next terms F E L I C E S
we will be considering the post
of Deputy President, and wheth-
er Christine Teller will run for
it
Next Term
[Plans for next term's F E L I C E S
' are well under way. One of the
main ideas I want to introduce is I
an occasional feature article of
general interest—not specifically
r e l a t e d to any p o l i t i c a l or
religious viewpoint. I mentined
this a few weeks back, and since
then we've been offered an
outing with IC Balloon Club, a
free parachute jump, and several
other goodies. Special c o m -
mendation for the two girls who
offered to write a feature on a
health and beauty parlour if we
could negotiate a free session for
them; it's looking hopeful for
that, too. We are also going to
have a F E L I X investigation into
boar pheromones, the only 'sex
aid' to be taken seriously in the
last twenty years.
Another idea I've considered
is to use F E L I X to coordinate a
campus-wide census with the
help of, say, the Welfare depart-
ment. Would you a) be interest-
ed and b) be prepared to cooper-
ate with a serious, anonymous,
properly organised census into
students' opinions and activities
concerning sex, sexism, drugs,
police harassment etc., and if so,
what do you think should be
included in the 'etc.'?
Also coming next term is a
numerically sequential cartoon
strip entitled The Horns of
Uncertainty. The etymological
aspects of this will not become
clear until the series begins to
unfold, but as a foretaste, the
zeroth installment is printed on
this page.

things I promised to try to find
room for in F E L I X , but didn't.
Here, then, is my Stop Press for
the Christmas issue:
RCS are holding a Regalia
Sale in the J C R on Thursday for
one day only. It will last from
lOOOh to 1600h, and they will be
selling old stock at greatly

On the same evening, 'The

Union Concert Hall from 2000h

the party will include 'dubious

that's supposed to mean.
Peter Mee, the College Regist-

Engineering Council's Young

open to any individual or small
group who should submit a
project based on any branch of
engineering which is aimed at

or an existing process, or show
evidence of improvements in the
