C h o m p e r s , 2 Exhibition Road, S W 7 , 589-
8947.
On your way to the Hungry Fisherman you
may have noted an ornate building on the left
hand side of Exhibition Road, boldly labelled
Chompers. Ensconced behind the steamed up
windows, instead of the trendy dentist that the
name might have led you to expect, there is a
delightfully eccentric bistro.
The walls are crammed with 19th Century
theatre bills and advertisements. One wall is
devoted to photographs of Victorian nudes;
another is dominated by the front half of an
enormous stuffed cat.
The eating area is small, packed out with
tables and usually with people too.
The menu, although fairly short, has a
number of interesting and reasonably priced
offerings.
For starters, creamed T u n a Fish with
Almonds at 95p and spare ribs at the same
price were the most interesting option and
proved to be a good choice. For 45p the garlic
bread is excellent.
As long as you steer clear of the steaks at
just under a fiver a go the main dishes are of
the affordable variety (although I was sorely
tempted by the fillet steak with stilton and
garlic butter at £4.95). Trout in Almonds at
£2.65 and Fillet of Plaice with prawn sauce at
£2.50 were reasonable enough. The portions
are adequate rather than generous. Chicken
curry at £1.95 sounds as if it might be worth
trying.
O n t o puddings, maple a n d walnut ice cream
w i t h n u t s a n d c r e a m a t £1.25 w a s n ' t
particularly good value and the cherry pie with
coffee (sic) ice cream at 95p was unexciting,
the other puddings, all for less than £1 or so
might have been a better bet.
After recovering from the first sip, the rest of
the white house wine at £3.45 washes down
quite agreeably.
The bill for two including wine and service
charge came to £16. O n the whole, money well
spent.
