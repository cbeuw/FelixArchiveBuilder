Will Residence cope?
Houses ready on time
Q U I C K A C T I O N by C o l l e g e
and Union o f f i c i a l s . has
ensured the alleviation of
preliminary fears that three
student houses would not be
openatthe startof the s e s s i o n .
The houses concerned are
51 E v e l y n Gardens (part of
Mining House), 69 E v e l y n
Gardens (part of Willis J a c k s o n
House) a n d 14 Queensberry
P l a c e (Rayleigh House); a l l
three h a d only recently been
acquired by C o l l e g e and are
currently undergoing major
building work to bring them
up to the standard o f other
student houses.
The C o l l e g e h a d i n i t i a l l y
intended that rennovation work
should not s p i l l into the new
term. However a delay i n
commencing the work c a u s e d
the estimated finishing date to
drift w e l l into term-time.
B u i l d i n g s Secretary, D o n
C l a r k e , w h o w a s overseeing
the work for I C , was on holiday
at the time. In h i s absence
Domestic Secretary C a p t a i n
L i n d l e y and Union President
N i c k Brayshaw realised the
delay and took e v a s i v e action.
On Mr C l a r k ' s return a l l
three eagerly set about
renegotiating the building
contract. T h i s h a s now been
done and rennovation work
should c e a s e by September
27th. T h i s allows just enough
time to get carpets back into
51 and 6 9 . Only minor work,
such as the painting of
kitchens i s envisaged being
prolonged into term-time.
Vandals
L a s t Sunday at around 4pm
a cupboard in the Snooker room
(top floor of the Union) w a s
broken into and vandalisation
done. T h e cupboard itself i s a
write off, a s i s the rest used
to prise open the cupboard.
The I C U Deputy President
would like,to hear from anyone
in the Union B u i l d i n g at the
time.
N U P E
The C o l l e g e branch of N U P E
(National Union of P u b l i c
Employees) held a meeting
last Thursday to elect its n e w
officers. T h e s u c c e s s f u l
contestants were: R O N
B U R N E T T (Secretary), F R E D
B U R R I D G E (Chairman), R O N
P A R K E R (Minutes Secretary),
J A C K N U T B E A M (Auditor) and
J O H N M c H A L E (Auditor).
With l e s s than two weeks to go to the start of term, the
resignation of Residence Officer T r i c i a Greenwood h a s
posed doubts a s to whether the overworked and understaffed
Residence Office can cope with the immense volume of
work associated with the new term'.
It w a s precisely on the
grounds of staffing that M i s s
Greenwood had resigned i n
A u g u s t . F o r months she h a d
tried i n v a i n to increase the
c l e r i c a l workforce i n the
office from three to four. She
points out that i n the last few
months she had needed to
help out her staff s o much
that she found herself staying
in C o l l e g e until 7pm most
weekdays, a s w e l l a s coming
into her office on Saturdays.
T h i s , she admits, w a s just
about keeping things afloat.
'Nevertheless I felt I was
banging my head against a
brick wall over the issue of
more staff, so I decided to
leave' says T r i c i a .
Despite her confidence in
her former colleagues M i s s
Greenwood doubts whether
they w i l l be able to cope this
time around. 'The whole thing
just could collapse'.
Not surprisingly T r i c i a felt
that the superiors i n C o l l e g e
Administration d i d not f u l l y
understand the s p e c i a l problems
faced by her office i n providing
an essential s e r v i c e .
F E L I X broached the subject
of under staffing with M i s s
Greenwood's immediate superior,
Domestic Secretary C a p t a i n
L i n d l e y , but he preferred not
to comment o n the situation
except to s a y : 'I've every
confidence in the staff there
( R e s i d e n c e Office) and we've
every intention of coping. I
realise the difficulties but
we've every intention of copmg'.
Union blaze
Minor damage was sustained
to the Union C o n c e i t H a l l last
Tuesday (7th September) when
a fire broke out o n the stage
floor. Prompt action by two
individuals enabled the fire to
be put out w i t h i n fifteen
minutes, before it could take
hold. A n area of four square
feet of floor was later replaced.
At the time of the fire, the
stage floor w a s undergoing
sanding. T h e sander used for
the job h a d been unplugged,
although the machine had been
w e l l used throughout the
afternoon. T h e cables wound
around the machine's dustbag
were rather hot, and eventually
these c a u s e d the dustbag to
ignite. T h e dustbag i n turn
set fire to the c a b l e s and the
stage floor.
Smoke had engulfed the
stage when Andy Stevenson of
P a n d o r a Theatre arrived on the
scene. H e emptied two fire
extinguishers on the fire before
c a l l i n g for the assistance of
D P Derrick Everett. F i v e
minutes later, at about 5pm,
the fire had been completely
extinguished.
The stage floor h a s now
been resanded and r e s e a l e d .
