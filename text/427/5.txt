D o n ' t e x p e c t a n o t h e r P s y c h o
FAMILY P L O T - directed by Alfred
Hitchcock. (Empire, Leicester Square &
A B C Fulham Road)
T h i s Hitchcock thriller earns an ' A '
Certificate from the British Board of
F i l m Censors so do not expect another
' P s y c h o ' ; if it were not for the few
uncharacteristic swear words and
unfulfilled passing references to 'hopping
into bed', I am sure Lord H a r l e c h ' s
Board would have granted a unanimous
' U ' .
One of A l f r e d ' s lighter films then,
but none the worse for that.
The four leading players pair off
neatly into two 'tricky' couples-Karen
B l a c k and Bruce Dern play a rather
c h a r a c t e r l e s s c o u p l e o f big-time kidnappers
whose ransom demand is always a
large gemstone, rather apt s i n c e Mr
Dern's legal line is as a fashionable
jeweller. The other couple are a medium,
Blanch T y l e r (Barbara Harris) and her
cab-driver friend (William Devine). Their
trickery is simply small-time-Blanche's
spiritual powers are not all that they
could be and so her friend is sent to
find information which she can use in
her next 'trance' and thus keep her
clients supplied with messages from
the other s i d e . Since these two are the
'goodies' their parts are not quite s o
blandly c o n c e i v e d .
The paths of these couples are
unknowingly brought together in pure
Hitchcock style and much fun is had
out of the situation in which the smaller
fish swim more and more out of their
depth. There are the usual Hitchcock set
pieces which include a witty kidnapping
of a B i s h o p in full view of his con-
gregation.
William Devine, who plays the cab-
driver turned inept detective, has several
delightful moments, knocking out his
pipe on a l l manner of objects and seeming
to find e n d l e s s pencils and paper for
his notes.
The pace is a little slow and the
screenplay, from a noval by Victor
Canning, becomes rather transparent
when stretched over two hours, but
Hitchcock always presents an interesting
picture and Barbara Harris and her
partner are good enough to- carry the
film's thinner moments.

Thin thread throughout grotesque film
T H E T E N A N T - - directed by Roman
P o l a n s k i ; starring Roman Polanski
and Shelley Winters'.
T h e first half of Roman P o l a n s k i ' s
new film, The Tenant, portrays the
gradual onset of a persecution complex
in a shy young Frenchman. After about an
hour, however, you begin to feel that it
cannot last much longer and are surprised
to find that the thread is going to be
spun out for another hour.
P o l a n s k i , himself, plays T r e l k o v s k y ,
a mousy young clerk who takes over a
two-roomed flat in a seedy P a r i s block.
The previous tenant Mademoiselle
Choule, has thrown herself out of the
window and through a skylight fifty feet
below. F a t e draws Trelkovsky to the
hospital where he meets Stella, a grief-
stricken friend of the s u i c i d e ; together
they witness the final death-throes and a
blood-curdling scream which echoes
round the hospital.
The landlord is delighted to have such
a quiet tenant, but finds that a l l is not
well when Trelkovsky invites some
friends round for a Rouse-warming. The
neighbours complain of the noise but
the guests don't care and make a noisy
departure, increasing the tenant's
anxiety.
A series of bizarre incidents link
Trelkovsky with M i l e . Choule. T h e
concierge delivers her letters to him, and
at a nearby bar he is served with hot
chocolate and cigarettes that she l i k e d .
He begins to see a conspiracy of the
other tenants that w i l l drive him to
follow h i s predecessor and he seeks
refuge with S t e l l a . . B u t it is too late.
He returns to the flat and the film ends
with a grotesque sequence which cannot
have been designed to have the reception
it received when I saw it.
The film is characterised more by an
emphasis on detail which somehow
detracts from the whole. Individual
s c e n e s , like that in which one of
T r e l k o v s k y ' s noisy friend turns his
record player on full volume in the middle
of the night and tears a strip off a timid
neighbour who comes to complain: the
complete antithesis of T r e l k o v s k y ' s
situation, are memorable, where the
plot is not. It is perhaps because
P o l a n s k i cannot succeed in playing so
much of the film by himself - he comes
off better when in company.
There is a delightful performance from
Shelley Winters as the Concierge, not
missing an opportunity to dust the
banister as she takes Trelkovsky up the
long staircase to see the flat.

Sassafras — Riding High (Chrysalis)
In a strictly musical s e n s e , I don't
suppose any part of the country has
taken more to the sun-stoned idiom of
the West Coast than South Wales. L e t s
face it, the bands emanating from the
Cardiff — Swansea area have that
definite sun bleached, half-stoned (!)
musical ideology that has typified the
Californiafi music scene s i n c e 1966.
(No prizes for guessing where Ian
Morse comes from — Ed)
If Man have leant heavily towards
the Grateful Dead and Quicksilver, then
Sassafras have listened a lot to the
more country orientated bands like the
Burritos and Eagles; S a s s a f r a s ' s
music being a combination of country
raunch and hard hitting truckin' m u s i c .
With this new album the group have
taken their West Coast slanting a
step further, trying to present themselves
in a way more akin to their lively stage
presentation. The album c o n s i s t s mostly
of country-tinged truckin' songs with the
occasional ballad thrown in for contrasts
sake.
The title track starts the record off in
style the band maintain throughout the
set. E a g l i s h in f e e l , the song drives
along in fine style, with the tight harmonies
and short, tasteful guitar work providing
the main interest. The slightly harder
hitting 'Nothing to loose' is next up,
followed by another up-tempo tune
'Bad Blood'. After the first three lively
openers, the first s i d e d e s o l v e s into the
slower ballad 'See Through a Mountain'.
Side Two opens with 'New York
Collapse', the two lead guitars combining
to give a wistful air to the song;
Its interesting changes of tempo remind
me almost of some Spirit's ealier work.
After the well used Dankol Charles
song 'Small Town Talk' comes another
driving song, 'Long Short Lover' which
has fine harmony work and again the
twin lead guitars are used to very
tasteful effect.
The next song just doesn't seem to
fit in with the rest of the set, 'The
Band Refused to Play', a slow moody
piece that has little in common with the
rest of what's been laid down. Then to
end the album off, it's back to the
driving rock of 'Keep Rock 'n' Roll',
played in the style I suspect the band
enjoys most.
Whether Sassafras move up a d i v i s i o n
as a result of this record is doubtful
perhaps like Man, whats needed is a
stomping live album, which is really
what Sassafras are a l l about.
