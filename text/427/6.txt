F E L I X , S E P T E M B E R 17th 1976 - 7
Have you ever become dissatisfied with well known writers churning out the stuff week in week out. D Clark son has.
Here he sets out to copy the style of M . Parkinson on Cricket.
Glarkson on Parkinson on Cricket
AS I watched the procession of weary
E n g l a n d batsmen wending their way back
to the pavilion on the second afternoon of
the recent T e s t Match, I was reminded of
a similar procession which takes place
every evening as the day-shift trudge out
of the m i l l in B a m s l e y . There are men
in that m i l l , however, who unlike the
present England team, could tell you a
thing or two about cricket. In fact, come
to think of it, my aunt Bertha could tell
you more about cricket than most
professional cricketers bron south of
the Humber.
Lord Pongo Toffs XI
T h e r e ' s one particular game that I
s h a l l always treasure, from the summer
of 1903. It was the great event of the
year, when Batley M i l l played L o r d
' P o n g o ' Clark-Smythe's Toffs X I .
L o r d Clark-Smythe, who owned the mill
and most of our h o u s e s , was a town
councillor and president of the golf club,
the conservative a s s o c i a t i o n and a life
member of the M C C . It is in absolutely
no way whatsoever an exaggeration to
view this annual fixture as the entire
" A u t u m n ' s h e r e ! " came the cry as the
Christmas cards ousted the suntan lotion
f r o m . t h e shops. It's time to turn our
minds away from the drought and ways
of producing refreshing summer drinks
from old bathwater, towards the impending
academic year and all that it has in
store.
The new year w i l l bring with it a new
level of grant (£1380) for most of us,
which should put us back on friendly
terms with our bankmanagers, at least
for a few w e e k s . If Mr Callaghan and his
shiny new cabinet can keep inflation
deflated, we may even last a little
longer.
For those in need of financial aid there
is always the refreshing thought that
demonstrating rates w i l l be going up.
The Committee of V i c e C h a n c e l l o r s and
P r i n c i p a l s ( C V C P ) is likely to recommend
a minimum rate of around £2.20 / hour.
The A s s o c i a t i o n of University Teachers
will be pressing for a rate of £2.90 and
the NUS w i l l be topping the table by
pressing for £3.00 / hour. We can only
hope that the NUS will be s u c c e s s f u l in
putting their c a s e for our hardship.
(National Union of Students not Seamen —
the former don't seem to have quite the
stranglehold on the economy that the
latter do). T w o years ago the C o l l e g e
paid a rate of £2.00 and at that time
the first C V C P minimum was set at £1.50.
One year later the C V C P rate rose by a
staggering 40% to £2.10 and we leapt up
an earhtshattering 5% to £2.10. I do not
believe that we should get more than the
C V C P recommendation, but we must
press for this to be a reasonable amount.
Away from high finance to another
cloudy v i s i o n from my crystal b a l l . The
C o l l e g e Postgraduate Working Party is
about to make known its findings.Amongst
the recommendations is likely to be the
setting up of committees at both college
and department level to look into and
after a l l aspects of Graduate Studies at
IC. The department committees, apart
from providing hours of enjoyment for
universal struggle in microcosm; as Us
against Them; the people against the
idle rich; exploited against exploiters; or,
in short, right against wrong; good
against e v i l .
Our groundsman, 108 year old B i l l
Grit ( s t i l l as tough now as when, a mere
schoolboy, he hooked the legendary
'Speedy' Sam Strong for s i x , forward of
square) had prepared a t y p i c a l m i l l -
wicket. T h i s meant that the Toffs, being
used to playing o n l y o n b i l l i a r d t a b l e s , had
no chance.
Spilt ale and unsuspecting worms
Our opening bowler was, quite simply,
the fastest bowler in the northern
hemisphere. H i s name was George
Parkinson and not for him the inflated
run of these modern -weeds (for whom I
am reluctant to use the hallowed term
'bowler'). He would lumber in deceptively
slowly from about 20 yards, and then
bring his arm over i n an action so
ferocious that faint-hearted spectators
would s p i l l their a l e . Unsuspecting
worms to a depth of several yards would
undoubtedly feel the impact, as the
those sitting on them and helping the
C o l l e g e to get into the Guinness Book of
Records for having the largest private
collection of committees outside the
C i v i l Service, w i l l need P G reps, from
the groups and departments concerned. I
trust that you w i l l a l l give serious
thought to this matter and be able to
supply people of the right calibre and
dexterity to serve; otherwise I'll bring
back conscription.
To cast my mind back briefly to the
subject of finance and then forward to
1977/78, (it makes you quite d i z z y ) ,
you w i l l probably have noticed in the
press that drastic changes are being
proposed in the system of fees. T h e s e
may result in fees of £750 or more for
both home and overseas students. While
many of you w i l l not be directly affected,
many of your colleagues w i l l and the
number of research places is a l s o threat-
ened. A national campaign w i l l be mounted
to oppose these changes and I trust I
can count on a l l of your support when
the time comes.
On the s o c i a l side, I hope we can
organise a few outings and s o c i a l events
but I do not believe that the P G G should
be trying to provide college-wide events.
I think that we would do better to work
with the other groups already organising
such events to ensure that they are aware
of P G tastes and peculiar habits, and
a l s o to promote and help with s o c i a l
organisation at department level.
Now I must go and have another bath
so that we can water the tomatoes.
Please get in touch with me c / o the
Union if you have any bright ideas or
problems. The other two members of the
P G G E x e c are just slightly prettier than
me so you may prefer to contact them.
They are Gabriel le Dai ley and Kafe
Ducie, both in the Botany department.
Happy New Year!!!

leather cannon-ball struck earth and
flew at the wicket, defended now by only
a pale shadow of the confident young
hopeful, who, mere moments before, had
strolled to the wicket.
The Toffs managed to scrape together
53 runs, and at 2 runs for 6 w i c k e t s we
began to feel that the game was going
against us.
Jimmy to the rescue
Next in was our find of the season,
one Jimmy P a r k i n s o n , who even then,
at the age of 9, had the soundest defence
in E n g l a n d , and whose father grew
mushrooms in his c o a l - s h e d and often
won prizes at the l o c a l working-men's
show.
Sufficient to say that Jimmy scored
an undefeated 50, and we won by 4
wickets; a victory that few there w i l l
ever f
orget, I have not seen a better
innings by an E n g l i s h batsman, and if
the selectors had even half an eye for
talent, P a r k i n s o n would surely have
played in every T e s t Match from the
that day to this.

New courses
for PGs
For far too long has the accusation
been made, often with justification
that scientists are totally ignorant of
subjects outside their particular
discipline. However, from the beginning
of October, postgrads at IC have a
chance to rectify this. The Associated
Studies Board are opening their courses,
previously run solely tor undergrads, to
MSc and PhD students.
Unlike the undergrads, for whom the
courses constitute part ot their degree,
postgrads will not be expected to take
exams and a fairly informal basis is
intended, with a strong emphasis on
seminars rather than a rigid lecture
schedule.
Associated Studies cover a wide
range of subjects within the Arts,
Languages, the Humanties and Social
Sciences. As well as being of general,
interest, several ot the courses are
particularly relevant to postgrads, such
as that on communication which would be
very useful for anyone writing up a
thesis or considering a career in
lecturing or certain branches of industry.
In response to a suggestion by the
Postgraduate Group, an information
sheet will be issued to all postgrads
via the registry at the beginning of term.
For anyone who feels that within their
hard, scientific shell there is a budding
historian, economist, politician or
linguist begging to be let out, all ICUPGG
reps will have a copy of the full synopsis
and timetable. (So it you don't know who
your departmental rep is, now's your
chance to find out! Contact me in the
Botany dept on int 2263).
