Welcome to the first edition of F E L I X under my editorship."
A s i s normal for this time of year the editor i s just about
managing to find some clarity amongst the jumble of t a s k s
labelled his jobs. I hope I w i l l be in fitter shape come the
beginning of term, literally as well as metaphorically since
I'm just recovering from a dose of flu (which probably goes for
you too no doubt!)
Apathy is a word conned quite often to describe IC students.
I've used it many times myself, yet I had thought that IC
P o s t Graduates would have submitted more copy for this i s s u e
than has been the c a s e . That in itself i s a shame since
P G i s s u e s of F E L I X will only continue if the editor feels
they are wanted. The response so far seems to indicate, they
are not.
Tricia Greenwood
C o l l e g e Administration can not afford to lose people of
the calibre of T r i c i a Greenwood. In sixteen months she had
come to terms with the problems confronting students where
many of her superiors had f a i l e d . She was prepared to tackle
the unique problems presented by students in a friendly yet
efficient manner.
T h i s earned her office high student respect and co-operation.
Barring Registry there i s not another C o l l e g e administrative
department that qualifies for the same praise. Yet the frustrating
nature of the IC Administration finally claimed her as its
next victim.
Certainly if College residence prices are forced up much
more, by bodies above Residence Office, then the College
will need all the student goodwill it can get to avoid empty
hall places. The attitude of College Administration at large to
students hardly fosters this student co-operation/
Captain Lindley says he understands the problems of
Residence Office." Does he really? I'm told three weeks ago
he didn't even know the details of 'overallocation', even
though the lack of overallocation saw vacant hall places at
the beginning of last session.
What I find embarrasing about the whole affair is that
after Miss Greenwood had resigned she was asked to go to
Personnel department. Here she was asked for a description
of what her job involved so that an advertisement for her
replacement could be drafted. Apparently Mr Mellors was
embarrased at having to ask her this, and admitted the same.
Surely Captain Lindley, the girl's immediate boss, could
have given an accurate job description, thus saving Personnels
face.
If Captain Lindley does understand the problems that
Residence office face, then why did Tricia Greenwood resign,
when she was generally acknowledged to be doing a good job?
Furthermore if the Captain doesn't fully comprehend
Residence office problems, what of the future of the latter?
Captain Lindley was on the selecting committee for the new
Residence Officer.
Captain Lindley prefers to hide behind a wall of silence/
That he is quite entitled to do provided the service to
students does not suffer. I hope for the students' sake that
Residence can indeed cope, and that Tricia's successor is
not fettered with the administrative strait-jacket worn so
unwillingly by Miss Greenwood/

Once upon a time there was a happy
place c a l l e d ICU which was ruled over
by the w i s e King, N i c h o l a s I, and h i s
henchmen C h a l k y and Mole. The former,
a propagator of white lies was under the
impression that the power behind the
throne was h i s ; but in fact it was the
w i s e old Mole who pulled the strings and
faithful Jen was a l w a y s on hand, of
course, to change their nappies.
Enough of this flippancy; you all
thought this was going to be a little
fairy story, didn't you? Well look here,
this is a serious article by someone
doing a serious job - seriously. So what,
you may s a y ; what is ICU to me, or me to
ICU? Most postgraduates seem to think
that the answer to both questions is
" n o u g h t " . Many students spend years
at IC without going into the Union
Building let alone the office. There's
nothing we can do about that — we can
only provide the f a c i l i t i e s and settle
your grievances.
So what is my job, as Deputy President?
E s s e n t i a l l y , to maintain and extend those
f a c i l i t i e s . At present, I'm doing quite a
few odd jobs in the Union — carpeting,
putting in new curtains, buying furniture,
having floors sanded, and so o n . The
stage is to be rewired in the near future,
which is a pretty major job. You may have
noticed a couple of new, orange notice-
boards in the Union Lower Lounge, and
a few more are on the way. The new pool
ORANGE
MOLE
table w i l l be installed in the lounge any
day now and we're a l s o getting a photo
booth put in the entrance h a l l . The J C R
has been decorated and we're thinking
about new carpets. A l l I can say is — use
the f a c i l i t i e s , and look after them! If you
have any complaints or suggestions, put
them in writing and send them to me.
My biggest headache at present is the
organisation of F r e s h e r s ' F a i r . At last
count I'd allocated one hundred and ten
s t a l l s (110) and at present I'm producing
maps showing the location of each s t a l l ,
to be given out on the day (October 5th).
Could a l l society Committees make sure
that they are organised for the fair;
ideally s t a l l s should be set up by one
o ' c l o c k . Dort't forget that everyone is
welcome—come along and join something.
