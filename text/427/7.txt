No holiday for Clem
The Summer B a n k Holiday
was no holiday for Clementine
II, the R o y a l School of M i n e s '
1926 Morris ' C o m m e r c i a l . She
spent the weekend at the Isle
ofWightSteam R a i l w a y C e n t r e ' s
annual Summer Show.
The journey to the Isle of
Wight was uneventful (it took
4 hours to get to Portsmouth!)
and included a trip on the
Portsmouth to Fishbourne c a r
ferry w h i c h , like C l e m , i s i n
its 50th year.
C l e m was the oldest internal
combustion engine v e h i c l e of
the twenty or s o o n d i s p l a y
and had travelled the greatest
distance to attend the show.
On e a c h of the three days of
the show s h e w a s expected to"
appear i n the grand parade of
v e h i c l e s and then, after the
events for steam power v e h i c l e s ,
to take part i n the driving
test for commercial v e h i c l e s .
The three drivers with
C l e m took turns in the driving
test. They were required to
drive between o i l drum
markers, a comparatively
easy task for a small v e h i c l e
like C l e m despite her poor
steering lock. O f the drivers,
one demolished a n oildrum,
another had a clear round and
the third managed to s t a l l the
engine.
The return journey w a s
more eventful. Just outside
Portsmouth, C l e m ground to a
halt o n a h i l l . A brief
inspection showed that
something w a s awry with the.
transmission. A telephone c a l l
was made to the A A and
shortly afterwards a bemused
patrolman arrived, having been
told that " 1 9 2 6 M o r r i s " must
really mean " 1 9 7 6 L e y l a n d " .
He arranged for A A R e l a y
to c o l l e c t C l e m and after a
couple o f hours of G a l e s
Real A l e s a l l were aboard for
the trip back to L o n d o n . O n e
change of R e l a y v e h i c l e and
C l e m w a s returned to her
resting place i n the Mines
quad at 3.30am. Many thanks
are due to both the A A and
Imperial C o l l e g e Security for
their help a n d cooperation.
It i s hoped that C l e m w i l l be
in f u l l running order in the
near future.
(At present all three
motorised mascots are off the
road, although Guilds' Bo and
Mines Clem should be mobile
prior to the start of term — Ed).

VISA INFO
Overseas students are
a d v i s e d to apply for a new v i s a
to stay in Britain at least 14
days before their o l d v i s a
expires. T h i s follows a recent
c a s e where it transpired that
the Home Office had been
wrongly interpretting the l a w .
The ' o l d ' procedure w a s
that people applied for their
new v i s a at the time that the
old one expired. T h e ' n e w '
practice i s that you must apply
for a new v i s a before the o l d
one runs out. T h i s enables an
u n s u c c e s s f u l applicant to
appeal before the o l d v i s a runs
out, when they would be
forced to leave the country.
