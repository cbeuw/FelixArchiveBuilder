2 - F E L I X , S E P T E M B E R 17th 1976
A s you may be aware by now, the
prices in the c o l l e g e refectories were
increased by 10% on the 1st of September.
If you have found that your favorite (or
indeed any) meal has increased in price
by more than 10% then please let me
know.
Although we are aware of the official
prices in the refectories it is difficult to
know whether these are actually the
prices being charged, without your help.
A l s o , any comments you may have as
to the quality, quantity or temperature of
the food would be invaluable because if
you are paying an extra 10% for your meal
you ought to be able to expect a corres-
ponding increase in the standard of food
offered.
International Club
Imperial C o l l e g e Union is currently
investigating the possibility of forming an
"International C l u b " within IC. It's
purpose would be to co-ordinate the
a c t i v i t i e s of the numerous national
societies within the Union and it would
also provide a forum for promoting
multi-national s o c i a l events and culture
d i s p l a y s .
I would stress that this is only a
tentative suggestion and comments as to
it's potential viability would be
appreciated.
A l s o , we are greatly in need of
volunteers to man an information desk for
Overseas Students in the Sherfield

Afore I begin, welcome to the new look
IC U n i o n . A l l the old cobwebs have been
blown out and we are currently installing

D e r r i c k ' s busy decorating and I'm busy, so
don't disturb me....unless of course you
want even the tiniest little thing, when
I shall be only to happy to help out.
Who am I? Oh yes....me....welI I'm

now invariably I answer to Chalky.
In my opinion, this Post Graduate
issueiof F E L I X demands a certain kind of
flavour, not to put too fine a point on it
RELEVANCE. Therefore, we hit the road
with a few topics which I hope w i l l be
relevant to YOU, the P o s t Graduate.
Insurance
Here are some general points which
have recently been clarified by E n d s l e i g h
Insurance and Mr Fred A n n a s , the C o l l e g e
Accountant.
T o quote E n d s l e i g h :
" . . . f u l l time post graduate students
are covered by the Group Personal
Accident Insurance P o l i c y 24 hours a
day during term time and whilst taking
part in C o l l e g e or Union a c t i v i t i e s during
v a c a t i o n s . . . . "
There used to be some misapprehension
about a P G ' s insurance situation while
PRES

Nick Brayshaw
volunteers we get, trie less time each
person would be required but if you were
able to offer a couple of hours a week to
tell incoming O v e r s e a s Students general
(local) information it would be greatly
appreciated.
Interested â€” please phone me in the
Union (int. 3915) or Mr WS Robertson,
Sherfield B u i l d i n g (int. 3951) as soon as
possible.
Ladies Lavatories
F o l l o w i n g the most regrettable events
which have occurred in the Union L a d i e s
demonstrating to undergraduates. T h i s
was s p e c i f i c a l l y around an area involving
the cover of the policy taking into
account that the P G ' s were being paid to
demonstrate.
T o clear up this situation I quote
E n d s l e i g h yet again:
" . . . . t h i s cover (the Group Personal
A c c i d e n t Insurance P o l i c y ) would include
demonstrating performed for the benefit of
undergraduate students. The fact that the
post graduate students are paid for
providing these demonstrations has no
bearing on this i n s u r a n c e . "
Further to this, Mr A n n a s informs me
that " a P G , if sued by another student
when carrying out his duties as a
demonstrator for injuries received through
negligence, is protected under the
C o l l e g e ' s L i a b i l i t y P o l i c y . "
My thanks go to Mr Fred A n n a s for
providing a l l this information.
Parking
During the Summer V a c a t i o n , what
little of it there is left, the parking of
cars by students within the C o l l e g e
grounds is under the wing of Mr Ted
F i s h e r , Traffic Controller, Imperial
Institute Road. If you wish to park in
the C o l l e g e grounds go and see Mr F i s h e r
(hut at the entrance of Imperial Institute
Road). He w i l l take down the necessary
details of your vehicle and, provided
space is a v a i l a b l e , give you the ok.
When term starts the Parking Permit
Scheme w i l l be in operation as u s u a l .
A p p l i c a t i o n forms for Parking Permits are
now available from the Union O f f i c e ,
(note - these forms are for U G and P G
students only). They must be returned to
the Union Office by THURSDAY 7th
OCTOBER. The IC Union Parking
Committee w i l l meet that weekend and a
list of s u c c e s s f u l applicants w i l l be
published in the following F r i d a y ' s
F E L I X . I would take this opportunity to
warn you not to expect to get a permit
simply because you have applied and
YOU believe that your reasons are
sufficiently strong to warrant the issue
of a permit. IC UNION RECEIVES
OVER 800 APPLICATIONS FOR 200
Loo over the past year, the buildings
section have been active in trying to make
the area safe for those girls who use
these f a c i l i t i e s . The measures being
taken include leaving the staircase lights
on a l l the time (by means of locks on the
switches), putting frosted g l a s s on the
doors, and installing a number of b e l l -
pushes connected to prominent positions
in the Union and c o l l e g e . I cannot over
emphasize the gravity of the situation and
hope that a l l members of the college w i l l
treat these installations with the respect
they deserve.
Photographic Booth
We are currently involved in negotiations
with a supplier of photographic booths
with a view to installing one of their
machines in the Union B u i l d i n g . The
current state of affairs is that a machine
w i l l be installed soon, and w i l l be placed
in the main entrance to the Union Building
(by the entrance to the R e f e c ) . A l l being
w e l l , the machine w i l l produce four
glorious black-and-white photographs for
a nominal sum, which w i l l be suitable for
college registration cards, NUS cards,
British R a i l cards, passports etc. The
installation of this machine is conditional
upon:-
(i) Sufficient trade being generated to
viable proposition.
(ii) No serious damage or vandalism
occurring to the machine. You
have been warned!
N i c k Brayshaw
PERMITS EVERY YEAR! The s e l e c t i o n
committee has firm guidelines as to its
selection policy and these w i l l be
adhered to. P l e a s e note that within the
C o l l e g e grounds, once the scheme has
commenced, THE PARKING OF VEHICLES
NOT DISPLAYING PARKING PERMITS
IS PROHIBITED.
Provision i s a l s o made for the parking
of motorcycles and scooters in s p e c i a l
areas distributed throughout the C o l l e g e
grounds. It is not necessary for motor-
c y c l e s or scooters to display permit
labels of any kind but the registration
numbers of a l l machines must be notified
to the Security Office (165, Sherfield
Building) at least 48 hours before a
machine is first brought into the C o l l e g e
grounds.
Flat-hunting
It you are looking for a flat or w i l l be
before the start of term, I have prepared a
"rough g u i d e " to the 'game'. Included
in this literary masterpiece is: general
advice, lists of accommodation a g e n c i e s
and estate agents relatively near at
hand, a B r i t i s h C o u n c i l list of agencies,
a U L Accommodation Bureau list of
agencies and a l s o photocopies of the
sections "Accommodation A g e n c i e s " and
" E s t a t e A g e n t s " from the Y e l l o w
Pages (central).
If you would like a copy, there are
some in the Union O f f i c e .
The FLATSHARE scheme starts on
Sat 18th September, so if you're looking
for a flat or want to f i l l a vacancy in your
flat the Union Office is where it's all at.
The scheme runs t i l l the 25th September.
Hours of b u s i n e s s ? 10am to 5pm.
T o finish off this P G - orientated
article I would just ask you to support
your P o s t Graduate Affairs Officer,
R i c k Parker. With R i c k at the helm the
Post Graduates' lot can be put into
perspective for all to see but, and it's
a big 'but', he needs your support and
direction in order to be representative
of your v i e w s .
Bye for now, see you around and take
care.
