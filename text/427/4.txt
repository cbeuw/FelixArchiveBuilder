R e a d i n g hadn't promised to be great, i n fact on
paper this year's lina-up wasn't a patch on last
year's appearances b y Yes, Robin Trower and
Wishbone Ash. Nevertheless few fans came away
disappointed from this y e a f s event. T h e highspots
of the f e s t i v a l came o n Saturday and Sunday nights
when blues guitarist Rory Gallagher and tropical
sounding Osibisa respectively headlined the
b i l l .
Saturday's honours were a l s o shared by
Camel and Manfred Man's Earth Band. Manfred's
band were on first at 5pm, just after a stirring
set by John Hiseman's Colosseum 11, and a
performance I'd rather forget from the Sadista
Sisters. Despite suffering the first heavy shower
of the d a y , the Earth Band managed to p u l l
together a tight, varied performance of b a s i c
rock mingled with slight experimentation,
featuring numbers from the 'Nighingales &
Bombers' L P and 'A Word In Your Ear', their
latest album released two weeks ago. T w o
numbers that were particularly haunting and
captivating were 'Father Of Day, Father Of Night'
and, would you b e l i e v e , one of Manfred's own
compositions "Mighty Quinn".
I w a s expecting great c o s m i c happenings from
Phil Manzanera & His Band, particularly since
the latter included the much acclaimed B r i a n Eno
and e x - C u r v e d A i r keyboard man F r a n c i s Monkman
In reality I found their nett offering rather drab
and uninspiring, as d i d the crowd. A t first the
band's rythm section held a strong lethargic
beat, completely inhibiting E n o . They changed
tempo later on and got a creditable version of
'Babe's On Fire' and the Kink's 'You really got
me'.
Compere John P e e l w a s n ' t happy either,
L i v e r p o o l h a d lost, h i s only consolation being
that Everton had suffered the same fate. S t i l l
Camel made up for everyone's disappointments,
showing E n o just how experimental rock should
be played. T h e group have only recently come to
the fore with an excellent concept album 'Snow
Goose' inspired by P a u l G a l l i c o ' s famous short
story. R i c h guitar harmonies and P e t e Barden's
keyboards dominate the group's music, which
l i e s somewhere between rock and j a z z . B a c k
projection, smoke and lighting enhanced their
rendition of the album.
After a half-hour encore 'Lady Fantasy' from
Sunday s a w B r i t i s h Bands Osibisa and
Sutherland Brothers and Quiver taking most of the
spoils; the high-energy rock and roll of Black
Oak Arkansas earning them many fans, although
another American Ted Nugent proved a curious
phenomenon!. Forever passionately thanking the
audience, he seemed to be on a different planet to
the crowd, who were only to glad to get r i d of
him.
The other two high-energy bands of the day,
AC/DC and Sassafras were another story. T h e
latter were troubled b y a heavy shower that s a w
half the P r e s s enclosure stampeed out i n two
minutes flat. N e v e r t h e l e s s , their brash, abrasive
Welsh-rock, produced a charming innate response
from the crowd, who'd been longing to get on their
feet, ever since the accomplished performance of
The Enid just after midday. The band i s headed
by aristocratic Robert Godfrey, complete with
velvet D J , bow tie and cream trousers, whose wit
and humour went down exceedingly w e l l with the
audience. The Enid's music w a s good to boot, a
rather unexpected treat s o early in the line-up.
The A u s t r a l i a n band AC/DC weren't quite up
to the calibre of Sassafras, but they were great
to watch. P a r t i c u l a r l y entertaining was the stage
antics of guitarist Angus Y o u n g , who at 16 i s an
excellent c o m i c . Their almost punkish form of
heavy rock i s very s i m i l a r to that of the Heavy
Metal Kids. On this outing they over d i d the
dramatics, but are a band to watch out for in the
future.
A year ago Sutherland Brothers and Quiver
were at the point of breaking up. Fortunately,
due mainly to manager N i c k Blackburn, they
perservered and are today one of B r i t a i n ' s a l l -
round rock hopes. S B & Q have almost a universal
appeal as their event chart single "Arms of
Mary" showed. T h e band took a few numbers to
find their stride but never looked back after
"Dirty City". T i m R e n w i c h w a s in great form,
literally shaking venom out of h i s guitar on
"Dirty City", "Love on the Moon", and a n e w
number "Dark Powers". "Secrets" i s another
bouncy new number on their next L P , and even
though the group c l a i m e d they didn't know the
song, it came over tremendously w e l l . T h e
band finished, with boogie numbers 'Dream
World' and 'Bluesy World'. S B & Q well earned the
applause that followed.
Top marks for organisation
For the last sixteen years the Marquee organisation has put on a National,
Jazz and Rock festival. They were first held in Richmond, but the last five
years have seen the festival at Reading, right next to the River Thames.
Not many of you will have heard of the Reading festival and I'd guess that's
because it's well organised, very little trouble occurs, and it therefore doesn't
make newspaper headlines.
Yet in 1975 crowds averaging 35,000 attended this three-day extraveganza
and this year the totals exceeded an.average 25,000. The reason for this
year's drop lies chiefly with last year's festival which stretched facilities to
near breaking point. This year the Marquee Group pledged to Reading Borough
Council that crowds would be limited to 30,000. To achieve this they booked
less enterprising bands/ They needn't have bothered; Reading was in line for
many a bank holiday shower, which, besides keeping people away, stiffled any
fears about the tinder-like campsite/
With the weekend over local residents, Police and festival organisers all
agree that the 16th National Jazz, Blues and Rock festival has been almost
trouble-free/ The only 'major' incident occured on the first night, Friday, when
a couple of fans and a local reporter were slightly hurt by flying beer cans/
The trouble came after a reshuffle in the line-up of the groups caused two
reggae groups to follow each other/Rock fans became restless during the second
West Indian act, MightyDiamonds, and shouted abuse at rival reggae fans."
Empty beer cans were later thrown between the two factions, who were
seperatedby the Press enclosure/This lasted about fifteen minutes/
Although less fans attended this year's festival, there were more arrests.
Figures released by the Police were as follows (with last years figures in
brackets): Total arrests 155 (115), drug arrests 121 (69), public order offences
2 (15), drunkenness 6 (7). Despite the increase in arrests a Police spokesman
Despite the Weather Reading Rocked on
A report by Clive Dewey on the recent National Jazz, Blues and Rock festival at Reading
Camel it looked like Rory Gallagher was in for a
tough time. F a r from it. Y o u ' d never have believed
that h e ' d played a gruelling concert i n Stuttgart
that afternoon; Rory w a s menacing from the
start, h i s mesmeric guitar., blazening a trail of
magic throughout the 90 minute set. It's a wonder
the guy doesn't get heart failure, the way he
relentlessly ploughs o n , hardly pausing for
breath between songs as he utters a garbled
" t h a n k you very m u c h " .
The band started off with " / Take What I
Want" a gutsy up-tempo track that sets the stage
for what's to follow. B y the third number R o r y ' s
belching vaporised breath, almost dragon-like;
on the outsized T V screen you c a n even see the
sweat pouring off h i s arms. Rory hasn't changed
much. H e ' s s t i l l wearing that sweat soaked red
and white chequed shirt and playing h i s battered
guitar, slung h i p - w i s e , almost p h a l l i c l i k e .
A l l the old favorites were there, "Tatoo
Lady", the acoustic "Too Much Alcohol", and
many more b e s i d e s . T h e band previewed the new
Gallagher Album "Calling Card" due out at the
end of the month. Rory finished up with a 12
minute rendition of the ever-popular "Bullfrog
Blues" and stomped back to an energetic encore
with "Messing With The Kid". Who could w i s h
for more?
I found Ted Nugent rather uninspiring, i n fact
I gained more enjoyment from joining i n the
crowd's perennial chorus of 'John P e e l i s a c * * * '
(this w e l l known phase w a s inspired by the D J
himself, particularly when the sound engineers
played havoc with h i s records).
B y the end of Nugent an overdose of rock
and roll w a s i n order. Black Oak Arkansas
provided it. They're absolute professionals who
produced a crsip, tight set that no-one c a n
fault. Head singer J i m Dandy i s a no nonsense
showman and guided the band along like an
express train, with hardly a minute to spare, h i s
blond mare trailing behind him a s he stutts around
the stage.
Inspite of the rain they had one hell of a party
and sent everyone away i n high spirits as w e l l .
It w a s perhaps just as w e l l they d i d since the
weather had the last laugh; five minutes after
Osibisa had left the stage it poured down with
rain, a s though it hadn't rained for months!
Exuberant fans seemed to take it i n their stride
and by morning clothes and tents had begun
to dry. F a n s trudged their way through muddy
paths that had been green grass the night before,
and wended their way home, secure in the
knowledge that they had witnessed another
well-organised s u c c e s s f u l rock f e s t i v a l .
commended the vast majority of fans on being very well behaved. In his view
the festival had gone off very well.
Numerous problems have bugged many a festival in bygone days, many of
which can be classified under 'shortage of reasonably cheap food', and sanita-
tion. Reading overcomes the latter by ordering large numbers of 'mobile loos'
each with its own hot and cold water supply. Conditions here might not be
perfect, but at least these prove satisfactory. Another innovation of the
Reading festival is the daily clearing of the camp arena^nabling disposal of
the large quantity of beer cans. Glass is not allowed into the arena/ Both
measures keep casualty figures for cuts down to a minimum, indeed the hospital
tent was barely troubled during the whole festival.
The festival arena is plastered with many posters listing the agreed prices
for foodstuffs. Local traders in the arena charge no more than these prices, in
fact the Salvation Army tent were charging 2—5p less per item! A rough sample
of these prices in T e a lOp, coffee 13p, Hot Dogs 25p, Hamburger 30p, Chicken
and Chins 55p. Booze prices are similarly limited/
The festival opens just after noon and goes on to midnight. Later
performances are strongly discouraged, since every year the Marquee lodges
£5.000 with the Borough Council. For every minute after midnight that the
event goes on, the Marquee loses £100. Last year they lost 3,400, this
year they lost nothing.
So there you have it folks, what is probably the best organised festival of its
kind, certainly in Britain, and probably in Europe. I dare say you won't hear
much of future Reading festivals, unless you're a music fan, because they
continually win top marks for organisation.
