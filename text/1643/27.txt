Are you a Tinder racist?
R
acial
discrimination.
It’s everywhere.
Blatant or covert.
If you deny that it’s
an integral part of
our society, you’re either an
alien or white. Workplace,
education, media. It seeps
through every aspect of
society. So it obviously comes
as no surprise that it would
influence the way we select
our partners.
“Oh whatever”, I can hear
you say. “Race has nothing
to do with physical attraction.
How can you even measure
physical attraction? Get off
your politically correct high
horse and face reality.”
Conveniently for me, we
live in the 21st
century where
everything is digital, including
love and sex, i.e. everything
is quantifiable if you’re willing
to put in the hours. And that’s
exactly what OkCupid did
first in 2009 and then again
in 2014, looking at over 25
million users (which is a BIG
sample). So what did they
observe?
Well the pattern they found,
I like to call the I’m not racist,
but pattern, includes people
feverently denying being
racist but ending up falling
into patterns that definitely
exhibit racial bias.
To explain what I mean:
OkCupid saw that a very
small percentage (approx
10%) of users openly
objected to interracial
marriage, which is almost as
blatantly racist as forming a
white hood wearing mob and
prowling the streets with your
mates. But actually, more
than twice as many (approx
20%) said they would date
someone with a vocal racial
bias and over four times
that number said they prefer
dating individuals of their
own race. Now remember.
The sample size is 25 million.
So we’re talking big numbers
here.
Looking more closely at
their data, they saw that
overall white males got
the most replies when they
initiated the conversation
while they tended to ignore
messages from black women.
Similarly, white women
tended to almost exclusively
reply to white men. The same
preference was not only also
exhibited in Hispanic and
Asian women, it was actually
more pronounced.
What do these numbers
mean? Well, we still maintain
a fair amount of racial bias.
Whiteness is desireable. And
how can it not be when it’s
the prevalent standard of
beauty in the fashion indus-
try? When it’s associated
with power in politics, or with
brains in academia. When a
pairing of colour with crime,
immigration, and extremism is
constructed on a daily basis?
Some of the clearest illus-
trations of the desirability of
whiteness can probably come
from Grindr, a popular gay
hookup app, though I often
think of it as a meat market.
radius found two profiles
cashing in on the fetishisation
of gay black men (with the
inspired names “Blackguy”
and “Blacktop”), one profile
fetishising black men (“more
attracted into darker skin
guys”) and one profile who
wasn’t into Asians “unless
muscular”.
“Racial bias is nothing new
to me whether it’s in the job
market or a dating app,” says
a black user who wishes to
remain anonymous. “The real-
istic view is that black guys
are fetishised and criminal-
ised at the same time. We are
not playing at the same field
[sic]”. Indeed racial fetishisa-
tion is just a different side of
the same coin. It is a result
of racial stereotyping, with
objectification as an added
bonus. Homi Bhabha, a very
important figure in postcolo-
nial studies, argues that racial
fetishism stems from colonial
discourse, i.e. a discourse that
recognises yet denies racial
differences at the same time,
allowing the construction of
the ‘other’ and its demo-
nisation and simultaneous
idolisation.
Tinder, due to the swiping
mechanism is harder to inves-
tigate. Again you construct a
profile, but you’re randomly
pitted against other profiles,
which you then have to swipe
left or right on, depending on
whether you like them or not.
If you both swipe right there’s
a match and a platform for
conversation is unlocked. This
allows racial bias to remain
relatively conspicuous. Yet
racism always finds a way.
“I had a (white) guy on
Tinder ask me if I had ever
been with a black guy. I
asked why he was asking and
he said he wouldn’t sleep with
me if I’d slept with a black
guy. Suffice to say he didn’t
make it to a date”, says an
anonymous Imperial student.
We are genetically
designed to seek out partners
as different to us as possible.
Different genetic makeups
decrease the risk of inbreed-
ing, increase the chances
of finding a partner with
a complementary immune
system and produce healthier
offspring. Some theorise that
the reason Brazilians are
considered so attractive it that
they are one of the planet’s
most outbred populations.
So it’s truly remarkable that
a social construct such as
racial bias can make us go so
strongly against our nature.
Whether race is real or
constructed (it’s constructed)
is irrelevant, because race
has been used as a tool to
mould society for centuries.
Race butts into our collective
discourse every time there’s
international conflict, whether
that is cultural, financial or
plain old war. It is used as
the main fence to partition
ideologies, beliefs and ways
of life. So instead of denying
racial bias in dating, let’s
look it straight in the eye and
address it.

Your profile includes stats
such as height, weight, body
type and race. There is no
swiping, on the contrary you
are presented with a grid of
users in order of proximity.
You are able to do advanced
searches and filter through
potential mates, based on
the above characteristics.
And of course there is the
option for total anonymity.
All these features combined
allow for a good deal of
racism.
From the fetishisation of cer-
tain races “Black to the front”
to the blatant discrimination
against others “No fems, no
fats, no asians”– Yes, this
staple text from real profiles
and far more common than
it should be. Just as I was
