Luke Cage
and the black
superhero
Henry Wild
In a time where comics
books have been rapidly
diversifying their casts, their
on-screen counterparts have
been increasingly left behind.
Recently, however, that is
beginning to change, and
leading the charge is Marvel’s
Luke Cage.
M
arvel finally
has its first
black lead
character
in the
invulnerable
Luke Cage, and he’s not
clothed in primary coloured
spandex, but rather in a
hoodie filled with bullet holes.
Given that the same piece of
clothing is heavily associated
with the Black Lives Matter
movement (which began after
the killer of Trayvon Martin, a
17 year old African American
in Miami murdered back in
2012, was acquitted of all
charges) it doesn’t take an
English Literature graduate
to see the symbolism here.
However, the bulletproof Luke
Cage wasn’t always a symbol
of black power. He first
appeared in Luke Cage: Hero
for Hire in 1972 as part of the
‘Blaxploitation’ movement.
The ‘Blaxploitation’ genre
of media was one designed
to target a young, urban,
and African American
audience, and is notable
for featuring a mainly black
cast, as well as a primarily
funk/soul based soundtrack.
While some considered
the ‘Blaxploitation’ genre
as representing black
empowerment, the general
consensus is that it was
instead just perpetuating
stereotypes about black
people. Its characters’ main
traits were almost always
their skin colour and other
stereotypically connected
attributes such as being
‘intimidating’ or having a lack
of respect for authority.
Thankfully, Luke Cage
moved past that, as well as
his original costume of an
almost entirely unbuttoned
yellow shirt, a chain belt, and
a metal headband thing. As
his character, and thankfully
his dress sense, improved
throughout his comic run,
he became one of Marvel’s
better known characters.
While he certainly isn’t as
popular as Iron Man, he is
at least well known among
comic fans. Luke Cage’s
history in ‘Blaxploitation’,
however, isn’t forgotten by the
series, one shining example
of this being a scene wherein
the use of the n-word by a
kid prompts Luke to give a
Martin-Luther-King-esque
speech which still gives me
shivers to watch.
Luke Cage, played by The
Good Wife’s Mike Colter,
was first introduced in the
MCU in Jessica Jones as a
quiet foil and love interest
to Krysten Ritter’s drunken
titular character, a role which
he played to a tee. Given
his quiet demeanour in that
series, some people raised
concerns over whether he
could hold a whole show
by himself. Thankfully those
concerns were entirely
unfounded as he plays
a much more conflicted
character than he did there,
torn between helping others
and keeping himself hidden.
While Colter’s acting is more
than sufficient, there are other
problems with the series.
Although Luke Cage does
a largely excellent job with
its characters and the basic
premise of the show’s story
arc is fine - a petty crime
drags Luke into fighting a
world of organised crime that
he originally had no desire
to fight – its pace is not quite
right. After a slow and tense
build to Luke’s call to action,
despite a couple of moments
that are clearly designed
to relieve that tension, it
\\ Its characters’

nected attributes such

ing’ \\

never quite feels like that
tension is paid off. Don’t get
me wrong, there are some
intensely cool moments, most
of them juxtaposed against
the various songs playing
in a club called Harlem’s
Paradise, one of the key
locations, but (almost) none
of them ever felt like they
truly hit their mark. Beyond
that and the script for one
particular character (Spoilers:
It’s Diamondback) who kept
quoting cringey Christian
scripture like a robotic
preacher on a loop, it truly is
an excellent show.
As weird as it is to write, one
of the things that sold me on
this show was the abundance
of references that I had
absolutely no clue about.
Whether it be the usage of
a specific type of coffee for
the oft-used swear jar, or a
debate regarding various
black pulp fiction writers, the
usage of each reference that
I didn’t get was a reference
that someone else did,
another party being catered
to beyond young white men.
Luke Cage surrounds itself in
the culture of Harlem, and
black America in general,
basking in the people and
places that make it what it is.
From being the main driving
force behind one of the major
antagonists of the series to
the reason why Luke stays
and fights a battle that he
doesn’t have to, it’s clear that
Harlem is the true protagonist
of this story, and quite
fittingly, a bulletproof black
man in a hoodie filled with
bullet holes its agent.
