I
was born and raised in Lagos, the most
populated city in Nigeria and in Africa
as a whole. On September 30th
2014,
less than 3 weeks after my 17th
birthday,
probably the most defining event in my
life so far occurred. I moved to London
to attend Imperial College.
Before leaving, my parents gave me
a talk I imagine a fair few of my fellow
Nigerians must have received as well.
“Don’t go get drunk” (being 17 already
made this tricky) “and don’t do anything
stupid, remember you are there on a visa
and if you mess up you are coming home.
Put your studies first, everything else is
secondary. Girls can wait till after you
have a first class degree and don’t forget
your values and morals.”
Brimming with excitement for my new
experience, I probably visited the Freshers
Facebook group and college and union
websites pretty much every day after
receiving my offer, and had already
added a bunch of people from the
Freshers page (a lot of whom I eventually
never met in person). I had joined some
societies. I had even been handed my first
disappointment, realising that I would be
branded with the dreaded red square on
my ID and wouldn’t be able to attend the
majority of the Freshers events due to my
age. Regardless, I was looking forward
to the experience and even managed to
contribute some quality Game of Thrones
banter on the Freshers page.
The estimated population of Lagos is
somewhere around 21 million (London’s
estimated population is 8.6 million, to
put things in perspective) so in first year
I was one of the few people who didn’t
have to adjust to life in the big city. Lagos
also happens to be smaller than London
in terms of land area (the smallest state
in Nigeria) so I was pleased to be in a
less busy city. As naïve as my 17-year-
old Fresher self was, I did expect life and
people in London to be different from
what I was used to back in Lagos; after all,
I had visited London a few times before.
Nonetheless, life in London had a sleeve
full of surprises waiting for me.
I remember sitting in a lecture on British
slang in the Imperial International Student
Week (just before Freshers’ week) and
being asked to draw lines matching words
like ‘pissed’ and ‘knackered’ to their
meanings. I remember my first venture
outside the South Ken bubble since
arriving, walking around Shepherd’s Bush
Market and wondering if the Hammersmith
and City line had brought me to a different
city. I remember learning that fancy dress
meant funny costumes and not formal
clothing. I remember learning the great
British art of euphemising: instead of
saying “this soup tastes like crap”, I was to
say “this is probably not the best soup I’ve
ever had”.
That first October was a massive learning
period for me. There were some slightly
embarrassing missteps, like when I wore
a suit to my speech when running for year
rep. I thought I’d be more approachable if
I left out the tie as everyone else would be
in suits, obviously. Imagine my horror when
I showed up to find the other candidates
in sweaters and t-shirts. There was also
the time I went in my traditional wear to
the African Carribbean Society welcome
party because I thought, since it was
about celebrating African and Caribbean
culture, everyone would wear theirs too,
obviously. This one hammered home the
message – sweaters and t-shirts yet again.
There were adjustments to be made.
Lagos heat became London rain,
complaining about food with spice excess
became complaining about food
with spice deficiency. I had to
silence the voice in my head that
insisted on converting the price
of everything I bought to Naira
(Nigerian currency) and reminding
me of the extortionate international
fees any time I wasn’t working. I
had to deal with some annoying
questions about Africa and people
expecting me to know their random
friend from school who was from
Tanzania, which for the record
is further away from Lagos than
London is. I was introduced to
British humour, which a lot of the
time did not humour me, but I took
the cue from other people’s laughter
that something funny had been
said. I was introduced to puns, and
arguments about the pronunciation
of scone (still have no clue which
one is correct).
With time I got better. I learned
how to pronounce words like
Warwick and Woolwich and got
usedtoexplainingthatEnglishbeing
my first language and the official
language of Nigeria was why I
spoke it so well. I was brought up in
an environment where respect for
eldersisemphasisedfromchildhood
and non-negotiable regardless of
circumstance. However, with time,
I stopped physically cringing when
I called people significantly older
than me by their first name or when
I overheard a friend shout at and
talk back to their parents over the
phone. I was ‘integrating’.
Besides these harmless cultural
differences, I found myself in a
position where I had to confront
and form opinions on many issues,
some of which had never crossed
my mind. I had been thrown into a
vast ocean of -isms and -phobias.
Being Black in a predominantly
White country, I became aware
of the reality of racism, a concept

the importance of names as a part
of one’s identity
M
ost school children
would celebrate at the
glimpse of a substitute
teacher. Even the most
well behaved students
are relieved to ditch
their teacher’s pet persona momentarily.
However, for some Black minority and
ethnic (BME) students the arrival of a
substitute teacher elicits a familiar dread.
As the naïve teacher grasps the register,
an awkward smile is instinctively plastered
across the faces of BME pupils. A smile
that is worn as a shield to deflect the
imminent ridiculing laughter. A series
of Western European names are called
out seamlessly and then, at an expected
point, an anxious declaration of “I can’t
say this one” triggers a wave of giggles.
The cackles are even more piercing
when a teacher decides to butcher the
pronunciation of a BME pupil’s name.
This may seem trivial, but names are a
fundamental aspect of self-identity. Hence
the everyday derision of ethnic names has
a negative psychological impact.
Names matter in recruitment, too. So
much can be ignorantly inferred about
a candidate based solely on their name.
Countless studies have exposed the
brazen rejection of applicants with ‘Black’
or ‘African’ names. It is not surprising,
then, that last year the UK government
imposed name-blind UCAS applications.
The goal was to help increase participation
in Higher education (HE) from ethnic
minority groups. This new initiative was
generally commended but a deeper issue
still thrives. How do the aforementioned
groups participate socially once within
these HE institutions? Names cannot be
concealed in social settings. Personally,
on several occasions, my name has been
a social handicap. People have abstained
from conversing with me out of fear of
pronouncing my name wrong. Sounds
ridiculous but it is a genuine and palpable
predicament for many BME students. The
use of only pronouns ‘she’ or ‘he’ to refer
to someone with a non-Western-European
name is also very common.
This too is problematic as
it cultivates a relational
barrier. Knowing and using
someone’s name correctly is
key to establishing a personal
connection with them.
In response to employment
discrimination and social
awkwardness, many BME
students choose to take
on nicknames or ‘English’
names. The latter was an
enticing notion for me prior
to university. I deliberated
over changing my first name
to something more ‘simple’
but later refrained from doing
so. In my opinion, changing
one’s name to conform to an
environment is nonsensical.
It snubs unique culture and
discards the story behind a
name. It amputates identity.
Slave owners in the 16th
century understood this and
so christened their slaves with
Western names. Today, some
Black Americans celebrate
their inheritance of European
surnames, and others detest
it. Nonetheless, their choice of
name undoubtedly influences
their progression in life.
Finally, there are examples
which suggest society has
moved forward; for instance,
the succession of Barack
Hussein Obama to presidency.
Despite this, Jack Smith is still
more likely to be employed
than Oluwadamilola Alabi.
that had been so foreign to me
growing up in Nigeria. London is
incredibly diverse, which provides
a big learning opportunity, but at
the same time opens up avenues
for so many types of discrimination.
I witnessed the harsh reality
of this discrimination in the
experience of many Londoners
and its disheartening escalation
with recent events like Brexit and
the terrorist attacks in Paris and
Brussels. I found myself learning
so much about other cultures and
international issues. Every day was
a new awakening to my ignorance.
I was becoming more ‘woke’.
Lagos to London has been a
complex and multi-faceted ongoing
transition. Days have turned to

grown to love it here. I’ve enjoyed
the experience, from random
snowfall in May, suicidal pigeons
and homicidal cab drivers to sunny
days in Hyde Park, cheeky Nandos
and everything in between. I have
appreciated the exposure attending
such a multi-cultural university
affords me and have tried to make
the most of it. However, I can never
quite shake the feeling that while I
have made many friends and feel
welcomed, I have not felt at home.
London has its pluses, like easier
transport and 24/7 electricity, but
there’s been something missing. I
had been so ready to leave Lagos
for so long that it seemed ridiculous
to me that I could start missing some
of the things that had made me
want to leave in the first place.
Lagos to London was a six hour
flight followed by a colossal
paradigm shift. Although moving to
London greatly influenced the way
I think and see the world, moving
5004km away has actually brought
my heart closer to home and made
me appreciate Lagos more than I
ever had in the past. So while I live
it up in London, Lagos stays on my
mind.
See my fro,
It’s a testament of the persistence of my great great grandfather’s stubborn mane.
The thickness is my grandmother’s claim.
See my fro,
The titanium strands were designed to battle African thread.
See my fro,
Its blackness steals the sunlight.
Nigerian blood makes the curls tight.
See my fro,
It’s a living memory, a window enclosing a unique civilization.
