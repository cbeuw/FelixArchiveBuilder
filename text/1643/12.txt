Self Defense
Family at
the MOTH
By Robert Garside
\\ Crowd-pleasing
clearly wasn’t their
aim \\
pleasing clearly wasn’t their
aim, a vibe echoed by the
idiosyncratic between-song
banter from their frontman.
The dark atmosphere was
continued into the next couple
of songs, with the beak simple
guitar line and kick drum intro
of Good Idea Machine and
the (slightly) more uplifting
Self Immolation Family.
Swiftly moving onto perhaps
their best live song Tithe Pig;
the crowd visibly reacted to
the powerful layered guitars.
U
pon arriving at
the MOTH Club
in Hackney I
was instantly
impressed by
the 80’s working
man décor with large booths,
gold painted walls and ceiling
and darts championship
winners’ plaque attached
to the wall. This décor was
clearly kept by the current
owners and set a good tone
for the slightly weird bands
on the bill.
First up was Cassels, a two
piece from London, playing
a really promising brand of
indie rock. Whilst their lyrics
were a bit esoteric at times,
the emotional impact of their
final song was undeniable.
Creative Adult followed
shortly after. I must admit at
this point that I have never
gotten Creative Adult on
record; their post-punk too
psychedelic for my taste.
By the time the headliners
Self Defense Family hit the
stage the anticipation was
palatable, with the MOTH
Club now teaming with a
flannel wearing, bespectacled
crowd. Rather than choosing
to feed off this excitement
with a rowdier song, Self
Defence instead started off
with the miserable plodding
Cottaging, one of their slow-
est and saddest songs. Crowd
With the blocky chords
shifting and competing for
space with the driving bass
line whilst simple guitar riffs
swirl amongst them, Tithe
Pig effortlessly achieves the
catharsis that so many bands
try and fail to achieve. Many
other bands would choose to
end their set on such a well
written and performed live
song, but that would simply
not be Self Defense. Instead
they drop into the recently
released long and jammy
Brittany Murphy in 8 Mile.
All in all the gig proved to
be a wonderfully cathartic
experience.

ited by Noel
Gallagher
as one of the
reasons that he
has yet to reform
Oasis, Jagwar
Ma’s debut album Howlin’
(2013) was refreshingly full
of new and experimental
riffs, alongside 90s acid-
house. This Australian duo
return with a second serving
of electro-psychedelic rock.
The intervening 3 years have
mellowed and matured their
style although their youth
and inexperience still shine
through.
Formed in Sydney in 2011
by Gabriel Winterfield
(vocals/guitar) and Jono
Ma (synths/production),
they were joined in 2012 by
English bass guitarist Jack
Freeman. Having supported
Foals, The xx and Tame
Impala on tour, elements of
all three can be heard. Effort-
lessly shifting and sliding
between both genres and
live and synthetic instruments,
the album is a showcase by
a band not afraid to play
by its own rules. Stand out
tracks include teaser single
O B 1, which sounds like The
Big Pink take on trip hop, and
Say What You Feel, which dis-
solves from retro 60s vocals
into steel drums underpinned
by a four-to-the-floor beat.
At no point do these
influences seem out of place
or forced, rather it feels all
too comfortable. Lacking
the roughshod energy of
Howlin’, this album is muted
in comparison. The more
serious mood – with a track
list reading “Falling; Loose
Ends; Don’t Make It Right”,
doesn’t quite fit with the
bands carefree and playful
character. Typically simple
and repetitive lyrics give
us impressions instead of
windows into Gabriel’s and
Jono’s experiences. While
enjoyable and easy to listen
to, it doesn’t leave me itching
to hit replay.
Altogether a very solid and
varied production, especially
considering its all in-house
– Jono Ma helped build the
studio they used to record it.
Yet when so easily compared
to similar sounding giants,
album cover and reflective
title, perhaps signs of an
angsty teenage phase that
will be shed in favour of a less
self-conscious sound. Expect
big things to follow.
Listen if you like: Temples,
Tame Impala or Oasis.
Tame Impala, we can only
hope they have some grow-
ing left to do. It’s a stormy
