I
t makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside seeing – or
rather, being unable to see – the paper around
campus on a Monday. It might be that someone is
making a life-size papier-mâché replica of Queen’s
Tower, or that someone requires A LOT of kindling.
But I want to believe that it was you picking up
felix, reading our ‘top journalism’, getting your news,
your science, your culture, your puzzles fixes.
Apparently some of our writing has caused a bit of
a stir, but hey, for me that feels like a nice pat on the
back – we’re encouraging dialogue. You can hear the
buzz of conversation in the library cafe; then again
maybe it’s just starved postgrads.
This week the union screwed up the autumn
elections. They sent out a humble email, (subject “We
made a mistake”) and apologised Hollywood-style,
acknowledging their error.
Also, Commemoration Day came and passed. There
were long queues and that’s really it.
But, despite commemoration day, this issue is
dedicated to the black, ethnic, and minority (BME)
members of our community. As we’re approaching the
end of October you might not have realised that we’re
also nearing the end of black history month which,
in one form or another, has been around since the
1920’s.
Race has always been a divisive issue and giving a
platform to voices from all cultural backgrounds so that
they can be heard loud and clear, is something we as a
society (not just an Imperial society) are still working on.
We worked with the BME officer at Imperial this year to
send a message, that part of our mission is to strengthen
these voices; we are here to discuss issues that need
discussing. We don’t want this to be a token edition, but
it depends on you as much as it depends on us. If you
feel that there were issues that we didn’t touch upon this
week, tell us, or even better write for us. We’re only as
good as you let us be.
