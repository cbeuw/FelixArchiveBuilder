the subcontinent that London has to
offer, ignoring the pilfered gems and
riches of the V&A in deference to
the wonder of a curryhouse that is
Hopper, in Frith Street.
dish. The thick, orange sauce
covered the pair of bones and
glistened with the light, while
radiating an appetising fra-
grance. A hand-sized circle
of roti with golden brown
patches accompanied the
dish. I couldn’t wait to start.
With the marrow scoop,
I scraped the insides of the
bone, dolloped the wobbly
mixture onto a piece of roti
and threw the combination
into my mouth. It was an
explosion of textures and
wonderful flavours. The
bone marrow melted into
a rich, velvety liquid with
deep flavours of lamb. The
curry sauce surrounded the
tongue with welcoming spices
with a noticeable kick of
heat. The roti dissipated into
crispy, chewy strands which
embraced and absorbed the
sauces.
The hopper, the signature
dish of the restaurant, came
as a spectacular, thin, bowl
shaped pancake made from
fermented rice and coconut
milk, with a runny egg splat-
tered at the bottom, all on
a hammered copper tray. It
came with three condiments:
pol sambol (a relish made
with fresh ground coconut,
sun dried bonito, onion and
red chilli), seeni sambol (a
caramelised onion relish) and
a coriander chutney.
I broke off the crispy edge
of the hopper and dunked it
into the bright orange yolk.
The pancake became softer
and chewier towards the
bottom; the relishes gave
a variety of flavours and
experimentation. It was more
of a snack, but can be a meal
when paired with the many
karis available in the menu.
Hoppers definitely proved
its worth for its hyped reviews
and multi-starred ratings with
its friendly ambience and
approachable menu – and
an exciting addition to the
London curry scene!
H
ow do I define a
curry?
I can say that
a curry is that
exotic, fragrant,
bright orange-
coloured tikka masala in your
disposable takeaway box
on Friday curry night, along
with poppadoms and yellow
basmati rice.
In truth it is much more than
that. It is a complex combi-
nation of herbs and spices,
varying cooking algorithms
and ingredients. Its deep
history is not only exclusive
to the subcontinent, but with
much loved variations across
many countries and religions.
Despite its many different
colours, accompaniments and
recipes, we can all agree that
a curry is not just a dish, but
a culture. For me, a curry,
a good curry, is like coming
home after a long day
leashed by lectures and pro-
ject deadlines – my ultimate
comfort food. Hong Kong-
style curry fish balls set my
mind back to my childhood
days sneaking off to those
street food hawkers in the
narrow alleys after school.
The balance of mellow spices
and sweetness in a Japanese
katsu curry from Tombo
embraces my senses like my
white, warm, fluffy bathrobe,
even during their busy, buzz-
ing lunch hours. The kick of
heat from Dishoom’s masala
prawns sends sparks of excite-
ment down my spine like
watching a glittery Lush bath
bomb explode into a galaxy
of colours in the bath tub.
Despite our reputation for
transforming the wonderful,
full-on Indian flavours into
artificially coloured and
frightfully bland adaptations
(proudly named as the British
national dish), London has
never ceased to surprise me
with spectacular, authentic
curries. My last encounter
with such a curry was at
Hoppers, a restaurant serving
authentic, family-style dishes
inspired by Sri Lanka and
Tamil Nadu, a South Indian
state.
This little canteen has
earned quite some attention
across the food community
since it opened its doors at 49
Frith Street, with its cornflower
blue walls and coral red steps
against the dull brick walls of
the rowdy neighbourhood.
The no-reservation policy
guaranteed long queues
outside the tiny 40-seat res-
taurant every night. Knowing
its popularity and tendency to
form two-hour long queues, I
visited at 12am on the dot on
a hot summer weekday (yes,
I skived off work for that),
joining a short line of excited
visitors who, like me, were
anticipating the delicious,
hearty food described in the
numerous blogs, articles and
online reviews.
I stepped through the navy
blue door into an entirely
different world. The room
was dimly lit with warm
yellow rays from the ceiling
lights, like rays of sunshine.
Rattan covered the ceilings
and the walls; the prominent
earthy colours from the
furniture to the tiles and the
leaves dangling from the
shelves created an exotic,
and Lankan Ginger came in
a tall glass with a beautiful
peach-coloured ombre from
top to bottom, garnished with
a strip of rhubarb. The sweet,
fizzy drink was like a ginger
ale with a bit more heat.
The menu was simple and
easy to read, sectioning
into sides, short eats (small
dishes), kothus (a Sri Lankan
street dish made with a finely
chopped roti cooked with
vegetables, meat or seafood)
and their signature hoppers.
Following the recommenda-
tions online, I went for the
bone marrow varuval from
the short eats and their infa-
mous egg hopper.
The bone marrow varuval
came first on a brown,
thick-bodied, earthenware

a split second, my mind was
transported across the world
from the gloomy British Isles
to the subcontinent.
