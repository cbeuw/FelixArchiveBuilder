A
n international
study treating
r h e s u s
macaques with
SIV (Simian
Immunodeficiency Virus),
related to HIV, showed, for the
first time, long-term control of
the disease for up to two years.
The macaques were able to
use their own immune system
to keep the virus cell count at
low levels, without the help of
drugs, and for nine months the
virus was undetectable. This is
great news for HIV sufferers
that have to undergo frequent
and intense drug therapy to
keep HIV at bay.
Globally, 36 million people
suffer from HIV, and there is
no permanent cure for the dis-
ease. Currently, antiretroviral
drugs are used, which target
the virus to slow its replication.
Antiretroviral drug therapy
(ART) means that HIV patients
are able to live with the virus,
avoiding the death sentence.
Usually, regular and intense
levels of drugs are needed to
slow viral charge build up. This
can have bad side effects, such
as poisoning, inflammation and
accelerated aging. Given that
ART is the most effective treat-
ment at the moment, reducing
patient suffering is a priority.
This study brings hope that
one day, such rigorous drug
treatment will not be needed.
The key to success appears to
have been the result of using
combination therapy: both
antiretroviral drugs and an
antibody. The monkeys were
treated with antiretroviral drugs
for nine weeks, and an anti-
body was also given after week
nine until the end of the treat-
ment. An antibody is a protein
used by the immune system to
target harmful viruses and bac-
teria. The antibody given was
a variant of Vedolizumab, a
therapeutic antibody used in
the treatment of inflammatory
bowel diseases. It targeted
another protein used by SIV,
and HIV, to enter cells. This
stopped further spread of the
virus, as viruses depend on
using other cells as hosts to
replicate and spread.
After stopping both treat-
ments, the viral load was
undetectable for nine months,
and was still low two years
later. The success of the ther-
apy paves the way for better
treatment in humans, and a
clinical trial is already under-
way in the US. The goal is to
see whether this combination
treatment, using antiretroviral
drugs with the antibody, can
have the same long-term effect
in humans. The researchers
involved are confident that the
results will be life-changing for
HIV sufferers.
Howmuchwateristoomuchwater?
T
he mantra that
drinking lots of
water is good for
us is a familiar one
and indeed, the
NHS recommends
drinking 8 glasses a day.
However, a new study has
challenged this popular idea.
For the first time, scientists
have gained an insight into
the mechanism that regulates
fluid intake and stops us
from drinking too much. This
research suggests that we
should listen to our bodies and
drink according to thirst rather
than sticking to a rigid routine.
In fact, over-drinking can even
be fatal.
Previously, scientists had
shown that there is a ‘stop
mechanism’ that regulates
brain signals, telling an individ-
ual to stop drinking water when
no longer thirsty. A new study
led by Monash University has
shed light on this mechanism,
revealing that a ‘swallowing
inhibition’ is activated by the
brain after excess liquid is con-
sumed, helping to maintain the
correct volume of water in the
body.
In the study, led by associ-
ate professor
Michael Far-
rell from
the Monash
Biomedicine
Discover y
I n s t i t u t e ,
r e s e a r c h -
ers asked
participants
to rate the
a m o u n t
of effort
r e q u i r e d
to swallow water under two
conditions: when they were
thirsty after exercising and
then later when they were
satiated. The results revealed
a three-fold increase in effort
after over-drinking, implying
overcoming some sort of resist-
ance. This resistance is caused
by inhibition of the swallowing
reflex once enough water has
been drunk.
The scientists used functional
magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) to measure brain activity
just prior to swallowing. They
found that the pre-frontal areas
of the brain were much more
active during effort-full swal-
lowing than when swallowing
whilst thirsty. This suggests that
the pre-frontal cortex overrides
the swallowing inhibition to
allow water consumption.
In this age of health food
bloggers, many people are
formulating their eating and
drinking habits around elab-
orate routines. You can even
get apps which allow you to
log how much you drink and
remind you when to drink
more. However, your own
body is the best judge of your
needs. Remember that water
is contained in food and other
beverages. Drinking according
to a schedule whilst ignoring
signals from your body can be
dangerous. Over-drinking can
potentially leading to water
intoxication or hyponatremia
(abnormally low blood sodium
levels), leading to lethargy and
nausea and, in the worst case,
convulsions and coma. In rare
cases, marathon runners have
died after drinking excessive
quantities of water before a
race.
It seems we needn’t be slaves
to drinking 8 glasses of water a
day without reference to thirst.
Your body is highly skilled at
maintaining tightly calibrated
water levels, signalling you
to drink long before you are
dehydrated and balancing
water levels with urine. The
swallowing inhibition is proba-
bly crucial to this process. So,
trust your body and drink to
thirst.

F
act | Sperm takes
longer to make than
you ever imagined:
43 million years.
No, not quite 43
million years each –
it takes a mere 60 days for a
single sperm to fully develop.
The true scale of the prob-
lem of sex comes down to
the sheer number of sperm
required to raise the odds of
just one reaching the egg.
The average man will release
250 million sperm each time
he ejaculates. If you made
one sperm at a time, back to
back, it would take 43 million
years to produce that number.
Luckily, billions of sperm
start development every day,
so you can turn once-in-a-
lifetime into 4-times-a-day,
although sending that many
children through university
could be pretty crippling
in 20 years. We aren’t the
sexually advanced species we
might like to imagine though;
Rams produce nearly 100 bil-
lion sperm per ejaculate, and
a male lion can mate up to 75
times in a single day during
mating season. Legend.
So, men everywhere are
furiously producing sperm
while flying planes, repairing
the International Space Sta-
tion and running the United
States of America. Who said
we can’t multi-task?
