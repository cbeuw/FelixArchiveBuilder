\\ I once tried to
ignore the sting of
the word, shrugging
when asked “do
you mind if I say
the n-word?” Some
people, drunk
with ‘new found
freedom’, altogether
stopped using my
name \\
often followed by accusatory,
“not everything is offensive,
you know.”
Some might (and have
argued to me) that the
diversification of hip-hop and
rap means that the word has
taken on a new meaning, no
longer black-centred – just
I
get these questions all
the time: “Who’s your
favourite rapper?”, “I bet
you can freestyle!”, “How
can you not love Tupac?
You’re black!”
Hip-hop for some reason
never really appealed to me
when I was younger – I didn’t
hate it, but I tended not to go
out of my way to find it. After
moving countries and enter-
ing adolescence, I began to
consciously avoid listening to
it; something that thankfully
I’ve now gotten over.
For me, there hasn’t been
really much of a reason for
me to associate with rap and
hip-hop culture in general,
but most notably its music
has been synonymous with
the urban Black American
experience. But that was the
problem – I felt detached
from the scenarios often nar-
rated in the rhymes, lost in the
graphic depictions of places
and people. At the time, it
didn’t fit into my personal
idea of blackness.
Within the past decade or
so, rap as a sub-genre of
music has become gentrified
beyond its inner-city roots,
in that it is no longer solely
tied to, though it frequently
references, its base culture.
This, however, brings with it its
own problems.
Like any art piece, when
you take rap out of the culture
from which it came from,
there is a loss of cultural
context.
The original pioneers of hip
hop infused much of their cul-
ture into their music; with their
accents and cadence, they
painted the world they saw
and recorded the language
they used.
Language which included
the word ‘n***a’.
(Now of course, there is a
distinction between ‘n***a’
and ‘n****r’, but for all
intents and purposes we can
assume them to be one and
the same.)
The problem with the use of
the n-word in hip-hop is that
because it has been so widely
used in the genre, there is an
assumption that it is a marker
of the genre; when it should
in fact be viewed as indicative
of the musicians themselves as
people.
Consider the following
scenario: you’re with friends,
there’s music playing and
Kanye’s Gold Digger comes
on. Needless to say it’s
always awkward when
no-one skips that line and
everyone continues singing.
When I finally began to
warm to the themes and
sounds of hip-hop, this proved
to be a bit of a stumbling
block – getting into it could
easily become a commonality
between myself and other
non-black friends who may
have taken this mutual ground
as an excuse to go full steam
ahead. What’s worse is when
people try to justify it – the
indignant, “it’s just a song!”, is
the other day a non-black
friend of mine was tagged
in a Facebook post with this
caption:
who don’t look like them, and
understand why this would
feel very uncomfortable.
Let me be clear on how
I’m black and I don’t rap
\\ By all means,
keep on jamming
out to your favourite
Kendrick song, just
be aware that just
‘cos he gets to say
n****a, don’t mean
you do too \\
I feel, rap music has most
certainly gone beyond the
African-American/Black
community to permeate and
include some cultures and
experiences. But that does
not mean that the n-word is
bound to rap music itself. The
word is tied to the genre, it’s a
derivative of the culture from
which the music emerged
from and out of which it’s
predominantly produced.
By all means, keep jamming
out to your favourite song;
but the next time a Kendrick
song comes on, be aware
that just ‘cos he gets to say
n****a, don’t mean you do
too.
\\ It’s always
awkward when
no-one skips that
line and everyone
continues singing \\
Here is what I’m saying –
music is so infused into our
day-to-day life, we have to
consider the fact that it can
very easily go from our play-
list to our lexicon; and not
everyone is fine with the way
this word is used.
I once tried to ignore the
sting of the word, shrugging
when asked “Do you mind
if I say the n-word?” a few
years ago: as far as I was
concerned, it didn’t really fea-
ture much in my history, or my
culture, so I was apathetic to
it. That very quickly changed
when some people, drunk
with ‘new-found freedom’,
altogether stopped using my
name.
Despite coming from a
background and a place
where the ‘n-word’ essentially
had no power, it was still
relatively easy for me to learn
to take offence at it. Now
consider those people who’ve
grown up in communities
where they’ve historically
been called n****s by people
The late, great Tupac Shakur \\ Leo Gonzales
‘Modern day blackface’
or just a poor
performance? X Factor’s
latest tabloid favourite,
Honey G, leaves us
feeling offended without
really knowing why.

houting out the
lyrics to 2pac’s
California Love
while panting and
gyrating across the
stage, Honey G’s
first live X Factor performance
was truly a spectacle. The
budding “genuine urban”
artist’s short career hasn’t
been lacking in controversy.
Recently she’s been accused
of being a “fake” by Little
Mix (of Simon Cowell circa
2011) and has been subject
of an opinion piece in The
Guardian likening her to 19th
century blackface minstrels.
I admit her performance
left me cringing and feeling
confused. But trying to
disentangle the mess of
reasons why her act is so off-
putting proves to be no easy
task.
Is this political correctness
gone mad? Cultural appro-
priation is and always has
been a contentious topic.
Determining the point where
inspiration becomes denigra-
tion of a minority groups art
and history is muddied further
when its agent is farcical. The
onus lays with Honey G to
show us. If like Little Mix you
suspect she isn’t a true suppli-
cant to the altar of Hip Hop,
her act seems like a cynical
parody of rap culture.
Iggy Azalea, the white-Aus-
tralian, Pop-Hip Hop artist,
came under fire for misap-
propriation of black culture
after being nominated for
the BET Best Female Hip
Hop Artist award in 2014.
She was accused by Azalea
Banks of “cherry-picking”
parts of black culture while
ignoring its difficult history
and the issues still faced by
black people in the US today.
What particularly irked some
is Iggy’s ‘blaccent’, which she
attributes to learning to rap in
the American South. Whether
appropriated or not, none
can deny her genuine musical
talent and commitment to her
genre, as demonstrated by
her 129 award nominations.
Watching Anna Georgette
Gilford’s character Honey
G leaves us questioning the
authenticity of her persona.
Her clothes feel like a cos-
tume, her mannerisms stiff
and awkward, as if too-little
practised facing a mirror. A
friend from her time at the
University of Salford told The
Sun she had “dumbed herself
down” for the cameras whilst
masking her middle class
accent. Lola Okolosie of The
Guardian attributes this to a
‘reductive caricature’ of the
black rap artists she is cov-
ering, ‘as if blackness is the
antithesis’ of her white middle
class upbringing. But is this
really fair?
The clue is in the name:
Honey G is a 15-years-too-
late tribute to Sacha Baron
Cohen’s character Ali G.
Honey G’s true target of
ridicule is those that may be
accused of cultural appropri-
ation themselves. The British
Hip Hop fans that mimic the
style and mannerisms of their
favourite American stars. She
proclaims to hail from “North-
Weezy. North-West London.
In Harrow” and is most
definitely “true to the game”.
Her persona is designed to
mock her audience. It’s just
a shame that she’s ridiculing
pop culture that hasn’t been
relevant for over a decade.
So far, the two songs she has
‘performed’ have been Work
It (2002) and California Love
(2005).
Baron Cohen’s character
first appeared on Channel
4’s, The 11 O’ Clock Show
and was immortalised in his
2002 film, Ali G Indahouse.
A satirical stereotype of a
“white British suburban male
who imitates rap culture”
he is permanently decked in
oversized, brightly coloured
shell suits and draped in gold
chains. His ‘rude-boy’ accent
a parody of the BBC Radio
1 DJ Tim Westwood. Ms Gil-
ford’s persona is a sad mimic
of Baron Cohen’s original.
With the humour that brought
appeal stripped away, all
that’s left is a woman with
poor fashion sense and lim-
ited musical ability.
Not that Ali G was free
from controversy himself,
with critics such as F. Dexter
complaining that by adding
a degree of abstraction he
allowed the “liberal middle
classes to laugh [at black
street culture] while they
retain their sense of political
correctness.” Our discomfort
at Anna’s meta-caricature
could stem from a sense that
truly her performance is still a
mockery of black stereotypes.
This is a typical ploy of the
X Factor producers: a weaker
than average performer that
just keeps being “saved” by
the voters. Plucked from a list
of the weird and wonderful of
the British Isles; sadly deluded
shower singers that the audi-
ence can both ridicule and
pity, they add another ele-
ment of drama to each week’s
theatrical live show. Perhaps
what stings most is the feeling
of being played by Simon
Cowell as he rides the tabloid
storm created by Honey G all
the way to the bank.
