here is a certain
aesthetic, pioneered
by movies like
Tron, that popular
entertainment still
returns to today;
an 80’s vision of a virtual
future that never came to be.
Our nostalgia for this type of
visual style was what helped
make Rez a cult hit when
it was first released for the
Dreamcast and PlayStation 2
back in 2002. In the original,
producer Mizuguchi realised
a vision of a computer
“supernetwork” navigated
by an on-screen avatar that
would now be called ‘retro’.
But it wasn’t the gameplay or
graphics that set Rez apart.
It was a rhythm game that
didn’t require players to think
about rhythm, an on-rails
shooter set to electronic music
enhanced by the player’s
actions.
Today, even without expe-
riencing the VR mode of the
game, the improved visual
fidelity and sound make Rez
Infinite feel like a game that
has barely aged. Its simple
rail shooter mechanics (a
genre which barely exists in
2016) are a welcome relief
from the complex controls
of popular rhythm games or
third-person shooters.
Rez captures perfectly the
classic vision of what being
inside a computer might
gaming over the last decade
but with VR it looks like it
might see a revival.
In Rez the player’s avatar
floats throughout each
level, like the snowman from
Raymond Briggs’ cherished
children’s picture book. Unlike
other shoot ‘em ups, Mizu-
guchi’s masterpiece does not
require players to furiously
press the triggers of their
Dualshock controller. Rez
uses a lock-on system, where
holding down the ‘X’ button
and hovering over enemies
sets them as a target. Release
‘X’ and the game automati-
cally fires missiles and ammo
at each target in rhythm with
the game’s soundtrack. This
gives players the freedom
to play in different ways;
they can try and select every
target on the screen at the
same time or go for small
clusters on opponents in quick
succession. These different
approaches are unlikely to
change a player’s success but
can have a large effect on the
music.
At times, the music of Rez
almost becomes background
music, not because it’s uninter-
esting but because it becomes
part of the players decision
making, subtly controlling
their in-game actions. The
vibrations of your controller
act as a sixth-sense, a thump-
ing rhythm that never lets up.
Defeating different enemies
makes different sounds that
dissolve perfectly in the
endless beating of the back-
ground track. Scatter your
be like – a landscape built
from 3D meshes, hexagons,
floating cubes and circuit
board-like textures.

out all the lines, giving the

Floating in a sea of Low Rez textures \\ Enhance Games
Rez Infinite by Enhance
Games is out now on PS4
and PS VR
while low-res textures add
to the 80s inspired aesthetic.
The many floating objects,
swirling monsters and floating
battleships are quite unlike
anything in gaming today.
Yet surprisingly, this vision of
a cyber-dystopia looks back
in time more than it does
forward: at the beginning
of each boss encounter the
player hurls towards and
through a massive digital
monument. From pyramids
to greek temples, these
structures house inside them
god-like creatures that the
player must defeat. The forms
of these creatures are con-
stantly in flux, often coming
in multiple stages, and they’re
far more challenging than the
levels that precede them.
Simplicity is where Rez
succeeds the most. The
on-rails shooter genre has
disappeared from mainstream

aim across lots of small tar-
gets and the game responds
with a sequence of snare
drums while destroying larger
enemies creates deeper, bas-
sier sounds.
Completing the original five
stages rewards the player
with access to Area X, a
glimpse at the potential future
of the series. This new stage
goes off rails and offers a
different vision of a cyber
landscape – a world illumi-
nated by laser-dot pointillism
rather than the grids and
thick lines of the prior five
areas. The gameplay itself
is unchanged but the music
takes a more modern twist,
inspired by recent electronica
such as Four Tet. Together,
the vastly different music and
graphics make something that
feels more open and dream-
like. Since 2002, the way we
see the internet has changed
drastically. Rez Infinite reflects
that change, with Area X a
representation of the freedom
that the modern web gives us.
