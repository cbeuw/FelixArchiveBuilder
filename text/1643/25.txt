end up with a health warning

the whole experience, despite
making such a big meal out
of the process, was that it was
easier than I expected. There
is definitely more satisfaction
in eating a meal that you
have played a part in creat-
ing. Therefore, dear reader,
I don’t ask of you to use
this recipe for future meals,
although you are, of course,
most welcome to, but I ask of
you to be more open about
your cooking. Take this article
with a pinch of salt, quite
literally, and don’t be afraid
to make a hash out of your
meal, figuratively speaking,
after all, if everything doesn’t
go to plan there is always
Deliveroo (have I plugged
these guys enough yet?).
Exchange ideas for recipes
and cook together with
friends. The most enjoyable
part of the whole process was
the social side to cooking with
my housemate, and I will be
sure to give another meal a
go in the next few days. Bring
it on.
I
am a man of few talents.
In fact, I’m a man of such
few talents that one of my
few skills is to essentially
boast to anyone and
everyone of how
untalented I am at a given
activity. Take, for example,
cooking. I will happily, nay,
confidently tell you how I
am on first name basis with
most Deliveroo drivers,
how my first potato cutting
experience was straight out
of a Tarantino movie or how
my housemate (God bless his
soul) had to promise my dear
mother on the phone that he
would make sure that I ate
well this year.
So it was on the 10th
of
October a great surprise to
wake up to find that I would
be writing for the Food
Column of felix. Now to say
that I don’t enjoy food would
be a lie. Quite the opposite in
fact, I enjoy the eating of food
and take part in the act daily
(one of the aforementioned
talents), or browsing Ainsley
Harriet based memes online,
I have just never been one to
create my own such food. But
to write about making it? This
was surely beyond me; a task
akin to the Daily Mail writing
articles on politics. Preposter-
ous. Ridiculous. Impossible.
I accepted. (Joke’s on you
felix, muhaha.)
After all, cooking is a
fantastic skill to acquire, and
I thought that if even I could
learn one simple meal at a
time, then maybe this may be
of help to other closet baker
flakers at Imperial to seize the
spatula and open the oven.
What follows in the next few
paragraphs is a record of my
attempts to create what has
been optimistically entitled
“The Best Spaghetti Bolog-
naise” on the recipe section of
the BBC website. I hope this
may be of use; perhaps as
a guide of what not to do as
much as a useful recipe, but a
guide nonetheless of cheap,
easily-prepared meals for a
busy student.
Ingredients
•Onions and Garlic
•Pasta
•Bolognaise Sauce (cheeky
shout-out to my go-to bolog-
naise boy, Lloyd Grossman,
available at all good
supermarkets)
•Parmesan
•Mince
•Seasoning
•Lea and Perrins’ Sauce
•Olive Oil
Price Below £10 for over 3
meals worth of food.
Step 1 In which the onion
and garlic were chopped
This was an emotional
moment for me; with my first
step into the world of cook-
ery, I began to cry. But with
the support of my housemate,
we were able to successfully
dice the onion and garlic.
With the first sharp-edged
hazard avoided, the next
task was to face fire. Having
successfully scored a hat-trick
of oven burns in my first year
freshers’ week, I was deter-
mined to not let the same
fate befall me this year. With
great care, the onions, some
chopped garlic and some
olive oil were placed into the
pan and into the fire, with
after approximately five min-
utes. Salt and pepper were
also added to the meat at this
time. The lid was placed on
the pan, and a bottle of wine
was opened. The wine was
consumed over a period of
five minutes.
Step 4 In which not a lot
occurred
Wine had been consumed,
and what happened over
the following ten minutes
is unknown. What can
be assumed is that meat
continued to simmer for the
remainder of the 30-minute
cooking period.
Step 5 In which the pasta is
boiled
Having filled a pan with
water which is then brought
to the boil, the pasta is added
to this pan for approximately
eleven minutes. I would
suggest just trying a strand
of the pasta anytime after
ten minute and once it has
assumed the texture that you
want then you are good to
go. The pasta can be drained,
and the meat added. Bon
Appetite.
Step 6 In which a conclu-
sion is drawn
I really, really enjoyed
making the Bolognaise.
Although I can’t promise I
wont still be catching up with
my Deliveroo friends every
once in a while, I know that I
would like to take the oppor-
tunity to definitely cook some
more. One thing I found from
blasé disregard for common
phrases, until they were
‘sweating’ (they had assumed
a brown/coconut colouring.)
Step 2 In which the mince is
added
This step is fairly self explan-
atory. The mince was added.
Step 3 In which Step 2 is
explained
The mince was added to the
pan and heated under a mod-
erate flame. The meat was
allowed to simmer for about
30 minutes, with the addition
of the bolognaise sauce once
the meat had turned brown
