D
onald Glover:
creator, writer
and star of
Atlanta is a guy
I don’t think that
can be classed as
anything other than a genius.
Having such an expansive
career as a writer, stand-up,
actor and rapper at such a
young age isn’t something
that most could manage.
Neither could most create
such a great show as Atlanta.
The most adequate way I
can describe it would be as a
himself grew up, the show
primarily follows Glover’s
Earn Marks, a man struggling
to keep his head above water
financially who gets a small
lucky break when he finds
that his cousin, Paper Boi, has
released a locally popular
mixtape. The two, along with
their friend Darius, seek to
keep the fame train rolling.
Despite this premise, you
never feel like this is really
in grasp for the characters,
but you hope with them all
the same. Though the show
sticks with a half-hour comedy
format, it really excels in
straddling the line between
drama and comewdy, never
quite coming down on either
side in any given scene. This
is shown most expertly in a
scene in episode 2 dealing
with a mentally ill man in
jail. This scene is a great
example of the way the show
portrays dealing with the
experience of Black America.
While never forcing it down
your throat, the constant
awareness and understanding
of the characters’ poverty
‘black show’ with an all-black
writing staff makes it timely
as well with the heightened
racial tension across the states
at the moment. While it hasn’t
yet finished its first season,
I certainly feel comfortable
calling this one of the best
shows of the year. It really is
a testament to Donald Glover
to have another such wildly
successful project under his
belt. The one thing I don’t
like about this show is that it
means Donald will have less
time to devote to his music.

sympathising and loving the

explained late
last year, time
was when if
you had more
than one black person in a
show, it would be written off
as a ‘black show’. In fact, time
still is that having more than
one Asian person in a piece
results in it being known as
an ‘Asian show’.
However, with the increasing
democratisation of TV,
and the general on going
streaming service paradigm
shift, this is slowly beginning
to change. Shows like
Atlanta, Luke Cage, Master
of None, Citizen Khan and
Fresh off the boat have
penetrated the mainstream,
consistently pulling in high
viewship numbers and critical
receptions. Alongside the
growing volume of people of
colour in our visual media,
the variety of characters has
also blossomed. Obviously,
we’ve started slowly drifting
away from stereotypes, but in
distinct feeling of belonging
and a triumphant assurance
that this is the way it should
be. Unrestricted inclusion
also generates better and
fresher content through the
conveyance of a range of
experiences. The spread
of narratives that wouldn’t
traditionally have recieved
wide exposure or new takes
on existing stories and that
might better engage people is
only good for entertainment.
A curious counter-argument
surfaces to this. People
bemoan ‘diversity for the
sake of diversity’, but this is
one case where this is a good
thing. ‘Minorities’ have spent
decades relating to white
characters and will continue
doing so. Is it too much to ask
that we try relating to a few
of them?
