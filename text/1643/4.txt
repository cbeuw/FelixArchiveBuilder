Union screws up autumn elections
Days without election mistake 1599 0
\\ In our department
the first student staff
committee had to
be pushed back a
week, but similarly
departments across
campus are having
to deal with this \\
the final refresh overran 40
minutes, allowing students
who voted during those first
40 minutes to get a second
vote after the refresh.
An inside source told felix
that the only reason the union
even became aware of the
technical error was that union
officials were contacted by
surprised (and we imagine
mildly amused) students who
had managed to vote twice.
Though the Union estimates
that the opportunity to
vote twice was only made
available to fewer than 150
students, out of the 17,000 that
comprise the student body, it’s
often the case with Dep Rep
elections that the outcome is
determined by a few votes.
I
mperial College Union
had to remove 73
positions from the Autumn
Elections that were
underway this week, after
a technical error that
allowed students to vote twice.
The announcement was
made on Tuesday afternoon,
when Andrew Keenan, head
of the student voice and
communications, sent out a
mass apology to the student
body entitled “Autumn
Elections: We’ve made a
mistake”.
“This is causing us to not have
representation for the first
few weeks of the year. These
weeks are really important
especially for first years who
don’t have any idea how
things work”, said one CGCU
departmental representative.
“In our department the first
student staff committee had to
be pushed back a week, but
similarly departments across
campus are having to deal
with this”
The error means that another
round of elections will have to
take place next week.
Protesting the delay, a letter
was sent out by Abhijay
Sood, Physics Dep Rep,
requesting that voting for
these 73 positions resumes
ASAP and closes on Friday
as it would normally. Sky
Yarlett, Representation and
Campaigns Coordinator,
reportedly said that wouldn’t
be possible, however, for a
number of reasons including
the election by-laws which
state that appropriate notice
is given (namely “5 clear
College days in advance of
nominations opening”).
The screw up was partly
due to the Union’s approach
to many last minute student
registrations. As it’s still early
days, and some students have
only just recently registered
with their departments,
or are in the process of
switching course, their status
is occasionally not updated in
time for the autumn elections.
This communication delay
might mean that these students
will not be eligible to vote
during the elections.
To allow as many students
to vote as possible, the Union
keeps refreshing registration
details till the very last minute.
However, whereas the last
refresh usually occurs before
the elections begin, this year
Professor Hawking visits Imperial
Talks about Hawking Radiation. Pfft, show off Matt Johnston
that the next big discovery
is one related to either
supersymmetry, or the true
nature of dark matter but
acknowledged that it would
be even more exciting if
something unexpected was
found.
Professor Hawking also
praised the College earlier in
the day. “Looking forward,
Imperial College continues
to be one of the world’s
leading centres for research
in theoretical physics, string
theory, cosmology, and
quantum gravity, and the
College should be very
proud. I am confident that
the Theoretical Physics
E
steemed theoretical
physics boffin,
Professor Stephen
Hawking, gave a
lecture on Monday
evening, speaking
on black holes, Hawking
Radiation, and AI.
Taking place in a packed
Great Hall, Professor
Hawking was introduced via
a video from The Big Bang
Theory’s Sheldon Cooper
before launching into his
speech which largely covered
the area of physics that he
has become synonymous
with, black holes.
25,000 applications were
received for tickets, but only
a select few managed to gain
entry to the hour long talk.
60,000 people have now
watched the Facebook Live
video of the Q&A section that
Hawking did after the main
talk in which members of the
audience had the opportunity
to ask questions.
One such question focussed
on the rise of AI, a topic
which Professor Hawking has
warned could end mankind.
In the talk he said that AI is
likely to surpass humans in
the next 100 years and hopes
that “their goals are aligned
with ours”.
The LHC was also brought
up with Hawking hoping
Lef Apostolakis
Group, including five former
members of my own Relativity
Group in Cambridge, will
continue the great tradition of
fundamental physics research
at Imperial.”
Hawking also managed to
add in a motivational quote
during the talk, saying “If you
feel you are in a black hole,
don’t give up, there’s a way
out”. Cheers, Prof.
Sherfield hadn’t been this packed since lunchtime \\ Imperial College
