ue to a stellar
cast, impressive
soundtrack, and
production from
the studio that
made Shrek, my
expectation for Trolls was
pretty high – even for a kid’s
film. This was clearly matched
by the anticipation of others,
given that it was nominated
for the Teen Choice Award
‘Choice AnTEENcipated
Movie’ (groan). Before the
film is even released, there
was merchandise in every
shop and children already
own the full set of Troll dolls.
But all this build up made the
disappointment of the actual
film that much more bitter.
Things started well enough.
A surprisingly dark intro-
duction explains how the
song-filled, forever cheery
Trolls are held captive and
annually massacred on
‘Trollstice’ by the miserable
Burgens. The Trolls are eaten
because this is the only way
the Burgens can experience
true happiness. However,
on the eve of Prince Gristle’s
(Christopher Mintz-Platz) first
Trollstice, the Trolls carried
out their escape, led by
Jeffrey Tambor’s King Peppy
with the rallying cry of ‘no
troll left behind’. We then cut
to twenty years later, where
the trolls have already
forgotten the threat of the Bur-
gens due to their ceaselessly
joyous (read: perpetually irri-
tating) nature and decide to
throw a loud celebration. Of
course, they’re found and
trollnapped, leading our
heroine Princess Poppy
(Anna Kendrick) and grey,
songless Branch (Justin Tim-
berlake) to rescue them and
save the day. Cue the usual
rescue-mission dangers, even-
tual fuzzy-feelings between
the
two leads, and eye-rolling
plot points, topped off by
non-existent. It was horribly
clear that many of the head-
lining cast had gone to the
studio for the day, recorded
their few lines and collected
their paycheck, thank you
very much (I’m looking at you
James Corden and Russell
Brand). Their characters were
difficult to care about and
did not inspire compassion
or empathy – key values off
which children’s film are so
often based. I did not think
they were cute or funny,
nor did they put a smile on
my face. My most profound
surge of sympathy was
directed toward the crying
child who could be heard
throughout the cinema when
he just couldn’t take anymore.
I would’ve been quite pleased
if they’d all be eaten by
the Bergens – at least then
there’d be no chance of a
sequel..
The film is sold as the ‘most
smart, funny, irreverent ani-
mated comedy of the year’.
This is the publicity team’s
own version of ‘trolling’.
Simply put, the writing was
frustrating and the storyline
was old, tired and lazy.
Attempts to avoid this, such
as the slightly-too-subtle
references to classics such
as Labyrinth, were lost in the
malaise of cringe; in the same
scene, we met a cloud whose
entire dialogue consisted of
Dad jokes about high fives.
There was so much potential
here. But once the charac-
ter ‘Guy Diamond’ (Kunal
Nayyar) had farted glitter in
someone’s face for the third
time, even the youngest in
the audience couldn’t keep
laughing. Use of the (sadly
endemic) phrase YOLO was
a depressing nadir of the film.
As the credits rolled, and we
tried to escape, I had to wake
up a Dad who was not only
asleep himself, but had his
two sleeping boys on top
of him. I sincerely doubt
this was the effect the
studio was going for. The
tagline reads ‘Find your
happy place’ – yours will
be as far away from this film
as you can get.

The latest animation from
Dreamworks shows that the
studio has hit a new low,
producing an annoyingly
terrible piece of work, with
essentialy no redeeming features

Meanwhile, the roman-
tic subplot between
scullery maid Bridget (Zooey
Deschanel) and Prince Gristle
initially invokes some sym-
pathy, tapping into universal
feelings of impossible love
and unreturned attraction.
However, the connection was
short-lived when they turned
it into a contrived Cinderella.
Branch is supposed to be the
sarcastic, relatable, sob-story
co-star. His trauma derives
from killing his own Grandma
with his singing – mine will
forever be derived from
viewing this film. The brief
positive was the soundtrack.
The use of well-known songs
was enjoyable and creative,
bringing in a variety of hits
at clever moments, such as
Gorillaz’s Clint Eastwood
and Lional Richie’s Hello.
The music department did an
excellent job. Unfortunately,
the rest of the team did not.

all, it could not be felt. Having

flat and comedy timing was
