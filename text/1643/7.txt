FREEZE PEACH C O M M E N T
I
’m so tired. There is a
general consensus right
now in the media that
2016 has been, for lack of
a better word, a shitshow.
But as a person who has
experienced sexual assault,
the last week has basically
been a living nightmare.
For those of you living under
a rock, recently a recording
was released where Donald
Trump jokes about being
grabbing and kissing women
without their consent. The
Trump campaign has tried to
dismiss this as “locker room
banter” that all men partake
in, which does nothing but
suggest that he must have a
very low opinion of his fellow
man.
However, since those tapes
were released, ten women
have come forward with
stories about how they were
sexually assaulted/harassed
by Trump over the last 30 years
and Trump’s spokeswoman
has responded by saying that
these women simply want their
”15 minutes of fame”. Cue me
feeling physically ill.
I’m not sure where the idea
that going public with sexual
assault claims is ‘a glamorous
and profitable move’ came
from, but the media coverage
from this week alone should be
able to kill this misconception.
The women who have come
forward have been ridiculed,
shamed and openly been
accused of lying on a national
stage. One of these women
has now said she plans to
leave the US because she
fears for her family’s safety.
And, before we all get on
our high horses this side of
the pond, the woman who
accused Ched Evans has had
to move five times in the last
four years and has now gone
into hiding due to online and
physical threats to her safety.
Because that sounds like fun.
The attacks on these women
have ranged from Trump
saying one woman “wouldn’t
be his first choice” (i.e.
she’s not attractive enough
to assault), to one Trump
surrogate releasing the phone
number of another accuser.
\\ I’m not sure
where the idea that
going public with
sexual assault claims
is a glamorous and
profitable move
came from \\
For some people, the fact
that none of these women
spoke out before seems to be
enough to dismiss these reports
out of hand, even though one
of the women has stated that
the tapes’ release made her
realise that the assault was
not her fault for the first time.
Because the idea of speaking
out against a rich, powerful
man wouldn’t intimidate
anyone into silence. Because
apparently no one remembers
the Bill Cosby case.
These arguments are so
frustrating that they make me
want to scream into a pillow
because the “conversation”
goingonrightnowisessentially
the lived experience of most
sexual assault survivors,
myself included, blown up to a
grand scale.
Labour must lead
a positive debate
on immigration
Giacomo Boscaini-Gilroy implores
the Labour Party to change public
perception of immigration
I
mperial’s success depends on a
culture of open-mindedness that has
attracted academics and students
to come from abroad, and means
people from different cultures, but with
similar interests, can exchange ideas.
Immigration has allowed this university to
thrive, so why is it that in Britain today it is
so universally considered a burden on our
society?
The Labour Party is best placed to drive
the conversation on immigration to being
a positive one. The Conservatives are only
doing the opposite, with home secretary
Amber Rudd talking about shaming
companies that employ too many foreign
workers. However, Labour has tended to
be silent on this in recent years because
their support is split between traditional
working class communities of the Midlands
and the North, and progressively-minded
people mainly from Southern cities that
Vote Leave branded the ‘metropolitan
elite’. One veered overwhelmingly for
Brexit and the other is strongly pro-
Europe, so on the topic of immigration,
the two cannot be reconciled. The solution
has always been to avoid speaking about
it loudly, for fear of offending one of the
two sides.
The Harambe
effect: meme over
(serious) matter
Jonah Beaudin discusses the
internet’s propensity for turning
tragedies into jokes
The beginnings are there,
but as we have seen before,
the party lacks unity and a
single voice. Corbyn’s words
have not yet filtered through to
the bulk of the electorate, who
need to be convinced that
immigration can be made to
work. In the past, by shoving
immigration under the carpet,
Labour left a space pounced
on by UKIP, who made their
own views very clear and
perpetuated xenophobia.
Many Labour voters’ questions
about declining public services
and purchasing power have
been answered by right-wing
populism.
A debate without vitriol
might push us to associate
foreign faces and accents with
hard-working labourers and
highly-skilled intellectuals who
want to come to our country
because it is brimming with
opportunity. That is how we
build a cohesive society. It
should not all be down to
Labour, but in 2013, as home
secretary, Theresa May
introduced a divisive billboard
campaign telling illegal
immigrants to go home. I do
not think the party of power
has understood that threats
and marginalisation are the
last thing we need.
T
he story about Harambe gained
global attention this summer.
Then the Cincinnati Zoo wrote
“We are not amused by the
memes, petitions and signs about
Harambe.” And that broke the
internet. The number of memes created
skyrocketed. Songs were composed, signs
were made, petitions were signed. God
it was hilarious. But it seems like nobody
really cared about the gorilla.
“Dicks Out For Harambe,” isn’t
empathetic. It’s a joke. The mythical
creature of Harambe the Silverback
gorilla, has grown beyond just a tragic
incident. Don’t get me wrong, I still think
Harambe memes are hilarious, but the joke
is very different once one isn’t ignorant
about the sequence of events. Watch the
footage and make up your own mind if the
mom should be shot instead of Harambe?
As a result, it has been difficult to
understand what the Labour Party’s
stance is. Shadow Brexit minister Keir
Starmer called for immigration to be
‘reduced’, but in Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour
conference speech, he started delivering
the right message. He spoke out against
the demonisation of migrants. He decried
the lack of investment in public services
and housing that has seen immigrants
become the school-place-takers and
council-house-stealers. We need to hear
people advocating the benefits that we
experience as Imperial students. We need
to be shown specific policies like a high
minimum wage or a robust tax credits
system that can make up for downward
pressure on wages.

If there is something that this taught
Cincinnati Zoo though, is that you do not
mess with the internet. What were they
expecting? A politely worded apology
letter from all the h8ers and a gift basket?
This is probably why old people shouldn’t
use the internet.
I’m not mad about the Cincinnati Zoo
deleting their twitter account (just like
they deleted Harambe) but maybe we
should reflect more on our own ignorance
regarding trends such as Trump, Pepe or
even Harambe.
Up until writing this article I’d never seen
the footage of what happened during the
Harambe accident. My brief sorrow was
followed by a boatload of
laughs. Harambe being shot
is tragic. And the Harambe
joke has spread more joy than
tears on the internet, so is it a
good thing?
Finding the truth in a turmoil
of nebulous media messages is
difficult. Take the US election,
where voters seem to be more
worried about their candidate
being likeable, rather than
their proposed tax codes or
foreign policy. You do not
have to be a genius to be able
to undermine Trump as a sexist
megalomaniac who wants
to finally be taken seriously.
But sorry Donald, maybe the
white house is not the best
place for a billionaire who will
do anything for money.
I enjoy my internet rough
around the edges. It is the
only way it can capture the
Zeitgeist of a joke. However
real time self-reflection on
pop-culture is not exactly
something the internet excels
at. When is one ruining a
joke, and is one making a
point? Hard to say. Especially
now with US elections coming
around it seems like some
Americans should wake up
and stop laughing about the
joke they created. How would
Donald even lead the US with
such tiny hands?

“Why didn’t you say
something sooner?”
“Are you sure it was him? He
seems so nice.”
“Well I’m sure he’s sorry, it
was a while ago.”
“It’s not like you can prove
anything.”
These are the responses I
got from friends – people who
didn’t mean badly, but people
who live in a culture where the
first response to this type of
allegation is to assume women
are lying. This isn’t even
taking into account the stigma
surrounding male survivors,
since even the concept that
men can be sexually assaulted
seems to be far fetched for
some people.
So, just for the record, here
are some facts. It’s believed
that only between 15-35% of
sexual assaults get reported.
Compared to other types of
violent crime, false sexual
assault reports are not more
likely to be filed. Men are
statistically more likely to
be victims of sexual assault
than be falsely accused. On
average, for every 1000
reported rape cases, 994
perpetrators will face no
punishment.
This is less of an opinion
piece and more of a personal
plea: when someone tells
you they’ve been sexually
assaulted, please believe
them, please tell them it’s not
their fault. I know being a
survivor who hasn’t reported
is not rare. But the idea that
I’m not alone is, for once, not
comforting – it’s terrifying.
