Connecticut, David
Hare’s new play is
based on thriller
novel ‘La Main’
written by Belgian
author Georges Simenon. The
underlying themes include
jealousy, sexual desire, and
how impulsive actions can
drive a man to insanity.
The production itself has a
strong start, with 2 cou-
ples amidst heavy snowfall
attempting to make their way
home from a high society
party after their car was
stuck in snow. The effects
were really intense, with a
wind blower that would put
Dyson hand dryers to shame.
When they finally make it
home, only the two women
make it inside. They’re swiftly
followed by a man, Donald
Dodd, played by Mark Strong
who you may have seen in
Body of Lies, Sherlock Holmes
or The Imitation Game. After
several minutes of panic, the
trio realise that the fourth
member of their group and
Mona’s husband, Ray, is not
coming back. Donald again
leaves the safety of the house
for a further two hours,
coerced by his wife, Ingrid,
to try and find him. However,
this is to no avail. What
happened to Ray? Is he alive?
The events that follow focus
on the effect the inevitable
death of this man has on the
three survivors.
As the story unfolds, we
see Donald, initially a dull
yet loyal and good-natured

figure in his family and
community, get dragged into
an affair. This, of course, is
with the beautiful widowed
actress Mona, played by
Elizabeth Debicki, who most
recently starred in The Night
Manager. As rumours start
to spread, many start to
wonder what happened on
the night of the snow storm.
Did Donald really go out
searching for Ray that night?
Did he have secret motives to
let this man, his former best
friend from Yale, die in the
cold? This thrilling and grip-
ping tale of deceit, betrayal,
extra-marital affairs, and
madness culminates in a chill-
ing ending, which I guarantee
will not disappoint.
One of the most interest-
ing things about the play
itself is the way four black
screens from all sides of the
stage create a sort of square
pinhole effect between scene
changes, focusing on certain
characters almost like a lens.
The screens also frame rooms
of differing dimensions, creat-
ing a small black box around
cramped low-ceilinged rooms
and widening again when,
for example, we’re shown
Mona’s spacious Manhat-
tan apartment. As you’d
expect from the National
Theatre, the set is extremely
well designed and the black
framing made it feel almost
like a cinema screening. Even
in scene changes, telephone
calls booming from the speak-
ers enable the narrative to
continue moving without the
actors in sight.
On the whole, this play was
a continuous 110 minutes
of top-notch acting and a
gripping plot. I would happily
see it again and hope you
make the effort whilst it’s on in
Southbank!

Dylan won the Nobel Prize for Literature last
week, the first musician to win. Adam Gellatly
writes why Dylan deserves to win, and the im-
pact that the songwriter has had on him.
B
ob Dylan has
never not been
a part of my life;
his songs were
played constantly
in my parents’
car and home throughout
my childhood. Despite his
reputation as a lyricist, it was
the sound, not the content
of his songs, that I first fell in
love with. Positively 4th
Street,
a single never to appear on
an LP, stands out amongst my
early Dylan listening. With a
plodding piano melody and
Al Kooper’s unmistakeable
organ playing leading into
his voice, it sums up the sound
that Dylan was recording in
1965. It was a sound that
marked the end of Bob the
folk singer and the start of
Dylan the rock star, a sound
so beautiful that as a 7-year-
old you don’t fully appreciate
that the song is a rather
vicious attack on a former
friend. In a similar way to Like
a Rolling Stone, there’s an
immense amount of anger in
his words, but not his voice;
for Dylan, the subject matter
does not stand in the way of
a great song. Once you start
to listen to the lyrics, though,
my god do the songs take on
a new life.
I did so, inadvertently, while
doing homework on a winter
night in my early teens. I
decided to put on the album
Bringing It All Back Home;
I did this a lot, but normally
didn’t get past the first three
tracks: Subterranean Home
Sick Blues, She Belongs to
Me, and Maggie’s Farm. I
loved these songs so much
by this point that I would
always skip back to the start
of the album once the third
had ended so I could hear
them all again. I guess I
was distracted by my work
and so forgot to do so that
particular evening. The
album ran. By the time the
penultimate track came on
I’d finished the homework
and started to listen to each
and every word. It’s Alright,
Ma (I’m Only Bleeding) is, to
this day, perhaps the single
greatest example of song
writing I’ve had the pleasure
last week. Right she is, but not
only that: he performed those
expressions. Pre-Dylan (and
pre-Beatles), the idea that a
chart topping musician would
sing their own songs was
unthinkable. Hits were written
in office blocks by men in
suits and handed to the likes
of Elvis Presley for recording.
It is fitting then, that Dylan,
with 37 studio albums to his
name and having reinvented
himself constantly over the
last 54 years (from acoustic to
electric and back to acoustic,
from rock to country, from a
secular voice to that of a man
who has just found Jesus),
becomes the first musician to
win the prize in its 115-year
history. Much has been said
over the past week as to
whether the award should
be presented a singer at all.

\\ Dylan’s songs
are as great a
work of literature
as a collection of
novels, as much po-
etry to read as they
are songs to listen
to \\
of encountering. No backing
band this time, just the folk
singer, accompanied by a
harmonica and an eerily quiet
guitar, whose simple chord
progression changes little
over the song’s seven and a
half minute run time. I listened
to those seven and a half
minutes on loop for the rest
of the evening and I’ve been
listening to them regularly
ever since. Each and every
line written and sung by the
then 24-year-old stands out.
“Darkness at the break of
noon”, “Advertising signs that
con you into thinking you’re
the one, that can do what’s
never been done”, “For them
that must obey authority…...
Do what they do just to be
nothing more than some-
thing they invest in”, “Money
doesn’t talk, it swears”; most
lyricists would be prepping a
Grammy acceptance speech
for having penned just one.
Bob Dylan wrote 15 verses of
them (oh, and choruses). Bob
Dylan isn’t most musicians,
he’s a Nobel Laureate.
“For having created new
poetic expressions, within
the great American song
tradition” read Prof. Sara
Danius, Permanent Secretary
of the Swedish Academy, on
the announcement of Dylan’s
Nobel Prize in Literature win
Tarantula, a prose poetry
book and the first volume of
his autobiography, are all
Dylan has written in terms
of original literature. On top
of that his music has been
critically acknowledged his
entire career (13 Grammy
wins and an Academy Award
to name but a few), so is there
any need to be lavishing
him with a prize intended
for those who occupy the
world of written expression
only? Others, however,
have argued that his lyrics
themselves, published several
times, are as great a work of
literature as any author’s col-
lection of novels and that they
are as much poetry to read
as they are songs to listen
to. Dylan has not yet spoken
publically about his Nobel
Prize, despite playing a gig in
Las Vegas hours after it was
announced. A quote from
the man himself, given during
a press conference in San
Francisco in December 1965,
in response to whether his
music or his lyrics are more
important, is perhaps the best
argument one could give for
the greatest songwriter of the
20th
Century winning writing’s
most coveted award: “The
words are just as important
as the music. There’d be no
music without the words”.
