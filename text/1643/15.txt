lephant dung is to
Chris Ofili what
sunflowers are to
Vincent Van Gogh.
An art residency
in Zimbabwe in
1991 in which he saw lots
of elephant dung (but no
elephants) sparked a period
of fascination with the
medium that would fling the
recent art school graduate
into the limelight of the
modern art scene in London.
Elephant dung has featured in
some of the most memorable
episodes of Ofili’s career. In
1999, The Holy Virgin Mary,
a black Madonna with her
one exposed breast made out
of lacquered elephantdung,
caused something of a media
firestorm in New York, so
much so that it caused then
Mayor Rudy Guiliani to cut
funding for the Brooklyn
Museum, where the work was
displayed.
No stranger to controversy,
Ofili has made a career of
creating visually arresting,
larger than life works that
push boundaries even without
elephant dung. His paint-
ings in the past have been
intricate creations, bold and
colourful, filled with vibrant
yellows and scarlets, and
flecked with glitter. Ofili’s
work deals in large part with
the black experience. He
is of Nigerian descent and
grew up in Manchester. He
came to study in London,
first at the Chelsea School
of Art and then the Royal
College of Art, and he has
since moved to Port of Spain,
Trinidad. In some of his most
moving paintings he has dealt
with the subject of race and
identity head on. The 1996
painting, Afrodizzia, features
tiny cut outs of black cultural
icons. Diana Ross, Cassius
Clay, Martin Luther King Jr,
Tupac Shakur, among many
others appear with identical
hand painted afros against
a riot of colour. It is a cele-
bration of black identity, not
only of the individuals who
succeeded in their respective
fields during the Civil Rights
movements. Ofili describes
the use of celebrity in this
painting as a shorthand for
brotherhood; the faces are
recognizable close up, but
their identical Afro hairstyles
are meant to amalgamate
them into a collective. “It’s
Lawrence inquiry would
later find two of the men
guilty, and in 2011, they were
sentenced. The inquiry found
evidence of systemic and
institutionalised racism at the
Metropolitan police during
the 90s.
After a period of relative
absence from the art world
from 2010, Ofili returned with
Blue Devils, painted in 2014.
In Blue Devils, gone is the
elephant dung, gone are the
bright hues and dots; this is a
pared down Ofili.
The vast, almost three-metre
high canvas is entirely blue
as nebulous shapes painted
in slightly different shades of
blue and black emerge and
dissolve. It was inspired by
the performers who cover
themselves in blue pigment
and descend on the annual
Carnival in Paramin, Trinidad,
pitchforks in hand. This
disquieting otherness and

he has said of the work. The
background is a pulsing array
of colourful dots, inspired by
the formative Zimbabwe trip,
where Ofili encountered tribal
paintings in caves which he
says reminds him of ‘rhythm
of chants and drumbeats’.
It is this exuberant, joyful
way of painting, mixing
together influences from jazz
to hip hop to celebrity that
has characterized Ofili’s work
through the decades. How-
ever, even in its irreverence
and surface level frivolity, his
work has bite.
Ofili won the Turner Prize in
1998, the first black artist to
do so (he remains to this day
one of two: Steve McQueen
won the following year). One
of the works submitted as part
of portofolio was No Woman,
No Cry. Named after the Bob
Marley song, the canvas is
of a black woman, inspired
by Doreen Lawrence, crying.
Huge white tears fall down
the length of the canvas, and
inside each tear is the face
of Stephen Lawrence, who
was stabbed to death in 1993
in South London in a vicious
racist attack. The painting
reflected the grief and
frustration that the Lawrence
family, and the wider black
community, felt at the fact that
men who had committed the
murder had been arrested but
never convicted. The Stephen
violence of course carries a
dual meaning. ‘Blue’ in this
case could just as easily refer
to ‘the boys in blue’, police
officers, both in America and
the UK.
Black men face discrimina-
tion at the hands of police
in both countries. This has
been most stark in America
in light of the police brutality
and many killings of black
men that has sparked the
Black Lives Matter movement.
In Britain, with the merciful
lack of firearms, the violence
is less overt and yet the
discrimination no less potent.
The Guardian reported last
year that black people were
were up to 17.5 times more
likely than white people to
be stopped and searched by
the police in some parts of
the UK. This disparity in stop
and searches (the major-
ity of which do not end in
arrest) show what absolute
power the police can have
to inconvenience at best,
humiliate and hurt at worst.
Blue Devils with its undercur-
rent of menace, portrays this
eloquently.
In January next year, Tate
Britain will be holding a
retrospective of Ofili’s work,
bringing together his earliest
work with his more recent
output. There could not be a
more timely return to Ofili’s
paintings.
