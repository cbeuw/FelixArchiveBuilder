Alexis Abayomi. Overall the
last week of matches has
put the club on a really solid
standing for the rest of the
year.
T
hough term has only
just started, Imperial
netball have been
very busy with
trials, and over
the last week, the
first matches of the season.
The 1s have yet to play their
first match due weather
conditions but the other teams
have been doing the club
proud with a series of great
matches.
The first match of the year
for the 2s was against UEL,
meaning a long journey and
a challenging match. The
team were up by a goal by
the end of the first quar-
ter, which was impressive
for a team with three new
freshers and a reserve from
the 3s. The team played
well together as a whole
but the second and third
quarters got tougher as the
opposition noticed some of
our weaknesses. The fourth
quarter was when we came
into our own; the defence
were making incredible
interceptions and the attack
were working better than they
had all match. This combina-
tion led to a quarter win. The
final score was 24-26 with
Zoe Hall (GK/GD) chosen as
player of the match. The 2s
have continued this winning
streak on Monday with a
28-20 victory against Kings’
3s.
After a long trek to Ethos,
the 4s began their first match
of the season against Kings’
Medics 6s. Getting the ball
down court was no challenge,
however the exceptionally tall
GD and GK meant that shots
on goal were a bit tricky.
Nevertheless, Jess O and
Alice worked well together in
the D and scored some amaz-
ing shots. Sadly, the Kings
shooter didn’t miss a single
shot and meant that it wasn’t
a win for the 4s that day. But
half-time snacks (that turned
into post-game snacks) meant
that all-in-all it was a great
and fun first game for the 4s!
The final score was 13-30
with the player of the match
being Bibi Wood.
The 5s also started out
strong by beating Roehamp-
ton’s first netball team. It
was even more impressive
since it was the first time we
had played together as a
team (some people playing
for the first time ever) and
we managed to gel really
well as a team: defence was
solid, passing was snappy
and shooting was on point.
This was reflected in the final
score of 36-12 which puts us
on a winning streak of 1 with
the player of the match being
Shen Yin Gan. The 3s had a
strong first match as well but
unfortunately lost 40-15, with

ball was then fired out to
Macbeth, who ghosted
through a tackle before send-
ing the ball back to the safari,
where a grateful giraffe
somehow caught the ball and
loped over the line. Naturally,
the conversion was fluffed,
and the score was back to
7-5.
After a strong carry, Billy
succumbed to the curse of the
captain, which has claimed

Half time. The game
resumed after a stern talk on
the importance of retaining
lineout ball. A couple or 7
misplaced lineouts later, with
some pooey throwing, Henry
was consigned to the serv-
ants’ quarters for three nights
by Lord Edward Allingham.

C 1s XV arrived at

pristine pitch perfectly
maintained by the
excellent groundsmen
over the summer could give
Twickenham a run for its
money. The game began in
stunning sunshine with IC
putting pressure on Brunel all
over the park. This was lead
by Matt Blackett’s darting
runs balanced with a effort
to maintain decorum, but
he failed 2nd
year so no one
really cares about that.
Too many penalties cost the
home side a lot of territory
and possession. The tackling
was lazy and passive with
too few players putting in
dominant tackles, leaving the
officials with little choice but
to penalise.
Creative refereeing of the
scrum hampered the boys
in the front row, who were
unable to make much head-
way. The superior Molnar
brother and Head battled
hard but were unable to make
up for the ref, so the scrum
tended to be in reverse gear.
Brunel capitalised on the
momentum, and from a
tapped penalty they finally
decided to spread the ball
wide and target the forwards
that IC were forced to field
on the wing. They scored a
pretty dull try.
This ignited a spark in
Imperial bellies, and they
came out with guns blazing.
Stand-in Captain, Billy, got
his dancing shoes on, made
a half-break and offloaded
to chief back-up dancer Alex

an offload to gameskeeper
promptly sin-binned within
three minutes. Despite this
idiotic behaviour, IC man-

points to lead the game
8-7. However, IC struggled
against the increasing wind
and became pinned back in
their twenty-two and after
heavy pressure, conceded in
the corner. IC pressured hard
for a try to clinch victory but
fell short.
Notable mention for greying
fresher Connor who carried
hard throughout.
Missed the main man and
top dog loads.
Final score 14-8 to Brunel,

L
ast Saturday, Imperial’s
Ultimate Frisbee club
(aka the disc Doctors)
hosted a beginner’s
tournament in Hyde
Park – a chance for all
the new players to experience
competitive ultimate in a
tournament scenario whilst
playing against other
beginner teams from around
London. There were twelve
teams in total, with Imperial
being able to enter two
teams: dD Rick and dD Morty.
This tournament was a
chance for the beginners
(of which there are always
many) to learn the basics of
the game such as throwing,
catching and cutting (move-
ment on the field) whilst also
incorporating lots of fun.
Early on in the group
stages, the weather was fair
and there was little wind,
making it easy for teams to
play and nice to sit around
when they weren’t play-
ing. dD Rick and dD Morty
topped their pool and finished
second in their pool respec-
tively, both going through to
the top eight bracket.
During the final round of
games, the heavens opened
in dramatic fashion, dumping
a ridiculous amount of rain
onto the players. Nonethe-
less, the games continued
(albeit with a much more
slippery disc to catch). The
final was a really great game
to watch, with both Horsham
and LSE very evenly matched,
and a score line to reflect
that. At full time, the scores
were level, which meant
carrying on into ‘universe
point’ (the frisbee version
of sudden death). Deep into
overtime and in the pouring
rain, a layout (diving) grab
gave LSE the victory and the
tournament win.
Away from the final, the
two dD teams did themselves
proud, with dD Rick finishing
in sixth and dD Morty finish-
ing in eighth. Everyone has
progressed greatly from two
weeks ago when they were
at the taster sessions learning
how to throw to now being
able to play and understand
both the game itself and the
spirit of the game such as
integrity and self-refereeing.
All the teams improved
vastly throughout the tour-
nament and the layout grab
at the end was proof of
that. More generally, as the
teams played more and more
matches, they were able to
play much more fluent frisbee
and maintain possession of
the disc more. This showed
in the score lines and as the
tournament progressed, the
score lines got bigger.

these times of hardship, Anna
was standout with a wicked
sprint. With natural ease she
brought down players that

line.

therefore best match ever.
The game was delayed
thanks to the refereeing com-
pany not informing the team
of a cancellation (again).
The coincidental disparity
between the quality of treat-
ment the men’s and women’s
teams receive for their refer-
eeing needs is amazing, but
that’s a discussion for another
day. Luckily, a delightful
Brunelian stepped in to ref-
eree, choosing a 10’s game
with uncontested scrums.
The game was off to a flying
start. With a strong advance,
Imperial dominated the first
quarter with a core backbone
of experienced players. Two
minor injuries within five
minutes of play were not
enough to put anyone off with
Imperial slowly making gains
up the field. This culminated
in a scrum just metres from
the try line, a tense scene, the
ball precariously held at the
edge of the second row. It
was all on number nine Eliz-
abeth. She darted out, took
advantage of a gap in the
defence, and ran straight to
the try line, scoring between
the posts.
Then out strode the kicker,
Moran, placing the tee on the
ground and with an almighty
kick, the ball went soaring
over and between the posts.
Yet following this excellent
display, the Imperialites
began to tire and Brunel
went on to score three tries to
Imperials 1s. Things went from
bad to worse as captain Char-
lotte was forced off after a
Charlotte insisted on being
put back on despite several
suspected broken fingers
and quickly scored Imperial’s
second try of the match with
the help of Moran and Laura.
It goes to show, as long sus-
pected, doctors don’t always
know best.
So, one quarter to go, the
score stood 19-12, Imperial
only needed one more try
to break even. Suddenly,
Anna broke through Brunels
defences: “Run! Run!” the
spectators screamed, and run
she did, with the audacity to
outrun and cross over three
different opposing players,
to not only score a try in her
first game from a run half way
up the pitch, but between the
goal posts as well. The Impe-
rial Team ran to swarm her
in an emotional scene, with
about half of them making it,
the rest slowing to a walk. The
Imperial team continues to
work on its fitness.
With a conversion bringing
them equal and ten minutes
to go, Imperial was feeling
good – confident, even. This
was dashed when Brunel’s
star player was brought back
on and scored two more tries
before the whistle, leaving
the final score at 19-31. I’m
not saying every time Brunel
started losing they brought
on an England quality player
to score two tries and then
immediately go off, but that’s
definitely what happened.
Still a great start to the
Season for the Imperial
Womens, they didn’t lose by
triple figures and no one got
broken (except Charlotte,
more like caPain, am I right?).
