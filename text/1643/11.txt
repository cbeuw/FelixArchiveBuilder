that he isn’t a journalist, but
that he is merely conversing
with those in the film. But I
respectfully disagree — the
information shared through
his subjects is an integral
part of being a competent
reporter.
Despite all these complex
narratives, Herzog retains
an ability to chronologically
span through the Internet’s
history, from its 1969 con-
ception at the University of
California to what it will mean
in the future. This could easily
have been a hindrance to the
movie’s pacing, but instead,
it advances the narrative
and allows viewers to better
understand the Internet’s
impact through different eras.
Attempting to examine the
reach of the online world
is a daunting task. Herzog,
however, tackles the subject
with relative ease, inform-
ing and actively engaging
his audience through a
stimulating mental journey.
Along the way, he’s assisted
by the expertise of several
people whose lives have been
dramatically impacted by the
Internet’s presence. Thanks to
all of them, once the credits
start, we have a much richer
understanding of its impact in
our lives.
T
he Internet. It was
invented in 1969,
and has objectively
become a part
of society’s daily
consciousness. And
yet, director Werner Herzog
reminds us that it is much
more powerful than we could
have even imagined.
In Lo And Behold: Reveries
of the Connected World,
Herzog masterfully pieces
together a 94-minute doc-
umentary that details how
exactly the online world has
permeated our lives, from the
evolution of self-driving cars
to cyber security becoming a
priority among governments.
This film’s excellence lies
in the simplicity of Herzog’s
style: much of the film is
interview footage ranging
from expert hacker Kevin
Mitnick to famous entrepre-
neur Elon Musk. There is the
occasional b-roll and diagram
to break up the face-to-face
interaction, but what we see is
mostly authentic footage and
raw uncut film that usually
loses the audience’s interest,
but not here. The subject
matter is just too interesting
when we look at it through
Herzog’s eyes.
And perhaps one of the
veteran director’s most
thought-provoking views
came in an answer to an
audience question before the
free screening at the Curzon
Soho on the 14th
of October:
“Documentaries should not
just be facts … facts do not
always constitute truth.”
This idea applies throughout
the film, but one particular
example that jumps to mind is
where Herzog interviews the
family of Nikki Catsouras, an
18-year-old who died in 2006
in a car crash in California.
The family, who saw
horrible pictures of Nikki
disfigured online, denounce
the Internet as an “evil”
force. Lesli, Nikki’s mother,
even goes as far to say that
those who are connected
online have demonic spirits
in them — a statement that
is hard to believe, but also
hard to argue against. This,
however, effectively illustrates
the non-factual element of
documentaries that Herzog
appears to value.
It is this attention to detail
that makes the story more
effective — even for a 21-year-
old who clearly knows what
the Internet is and its ability to
connect others. The raw emo-
tion in the Catsouras scene
forces us to step back and
realize its negative impact.

DOCUMENTARY OF THE WEEK
Three french films that aren’t Amélie
Delicatessen Les Emotifs
Anynonymes
(Romantics
Anonymous)
Le Rayon Vert
(The Green Ray)
E
veryone who’s
cool has seen
Amélie, it’s one of
few French films
that has enjoyed
success outside of
France. Starring the adorable
Audrey Tautou, this richly
coloured film with an equally
mesmerising soundtrack filled
with quirky characters doing
quirky things in the quest for
love, is (in)famous for being
saturated with sweetness. But
there’s more to France than
cute Audrey and nostalgic
tinted cinematography. So
here are some other films
from France that are as
delightful to watch as Amélie.
The similarities between
this film and Amélie are so
obvious that it should come
as no surprise that they share
the same director, Jean-
Pierre Jeunet. The tone of the
film, although with a much
darker topic, shares the same
humour, quirky dialogue
and cinematography that
is abundant in Amélie. A
no-brainer for anyone who
enjoyed Amélie.
Romantic comedy done
right. This film is about a
budding romance between
two very socially awkward
people. Set in a chocolate
factory, there’s enough
‘sweetness’ to go around.
Directed by the one of
the men involved with the
creation of the French New
Wave cinema, Eric Rohmer,
Le Rayon Vert is not expected
to disappoint. And it doesn’t.
A gentle film about an aimless
woman recovering from a
break-up; it follows her during
her vacation and highlights
her growing boredom and
frustration at being expected
to play the role of the single
woman. Not sweet enough?
Don’t worry it has a satisfying
ending!
