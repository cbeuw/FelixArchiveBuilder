How deeply intwined are politics and art? Fred
Fyles argues they are closer than you might
think and makes the case for the continuation
of teaching A-level art history.
B
rexit is the news
topic that, like
Japanese knot
week, just refuses
to die. Since the
morning of the 24th
June, when pollsters and
politicians alike woke to a
country they didn’t recognise,
vast portions of the media
have been trying to unpick
the decision of 52% of voters.
There is no aspect of life that
is safe from Brexit, not even
linguistics; the British tongue
has been forced to contort
itself around portmanteaus
like Bremain, Bremoaners,
and Brenial.
Even the world of art
isn’t untainted: last week a
YouGov poll was released,
which served as a perfect
analogy for the state of the
nation, a Brexit in miniature.
The poll showed over 4000
members of the public a
selection of artworks – from
classics like Da Vinci’s Mona
Lisa, through Pop Art, right
up to the four Turner Prize
nominees – and asked
them the deceptively simple
question ‘Is this art?’ None of
the works received universal
acceptance; even Mona Lisa,
perhaps the most recognisa-
ble instance of Western art in
the world, was viewed with
suspicion by 2% of those
surveyed.
Alongside this, the surveyors
collected data about how
respondents voted in the EU
referendum, and this is where
things get really interesting.
For nearly all works, those
who voted to leave the EU
were less likely to think it was
art than their Remain coun-
terparts. This difference was
particularly marked in the
responses for more abstract
art, which sharply diverged.
For Mark Rothko’s Untitled
(Yellow, Orange, Yellow, Light
Orange), a classic example
of Abstract Expressionism,
the Remain camp voted 45%
in favour of it being art,
while in the Leave camp only
21% thought it was. Similar
differences were found with
works by Jackson Pollock,
Andy Warhol, and Marcel
Duchamp.
What does this mean? Well,
the most obvious argument
would be that those voted
Leave are as closed to free
artistic expression as they are
to freedom of movement. It
it this lack of openness, this
refusal to understand the
other, that most commen-
tators seized upon in the
run-up to and fallout from the
constitutes ‘real art’? Critics
certainly try, and many live
up to the caricature of a
liberal elite: out of touch,
snobbish, and uncaring about
popular tastes. Is it really
surprising that the Leave
camp – after rejecting the
mainstream media, leading
industrialists, and global
political leaders – would
shun the condescension critics
regularly place on work that
is quite visually appealing?
If this is the case, then the
obscene decision from the
government to scrap art
history A-level makes even
less sense. The country is
divided along fault lines,
both political and aesthetic.
London-based liberals feel
their country counterparts
are backwards while home
county conservatives see met-
ropolitans as a snobbish mob.
Perhaps if more people were
exposed to art, and educated
about it, there would be less

result; Leave were painted as
parochial bigots, with no real
appreciation of European
culture. Certainly, this has
an element of truth, but it’s
an interpretation as basic
as it is dull. Taking another
look at the data, things get
interesting.
The Leave camp didn’t
overwhelmingly reject the
works they were presented
with. There were two works
which more Leavers claimed
were art than Remainers –
The Singing Butler by Jack
Vettriano, and Mystic Moun-
tain by Bob Ross. Both are
works that are by-and-large
completely rejected as real
works of art by the majority
of critics. Jonathan Jones, of
The Guardian, said that Vettri-
ano has “no imagination and
heart”, and paints “fetishistic,
stylish objects…with a slick
empty panache”. Similarly,
Bob Ross is better known for
his PBS show, which aimed
to spread the relaxing and
uplifting potential of painting
to the masses, rather than any
critical acclaim.
These results reflect the dis-
trust the Leave camp seemed
to have of mainstream media
and metropolitan elites – as
Michael Gove quipped,
“people in this country have
had enough of experts’”
In many ways, they have a
point. Can anyone really act
as an adjudicator of what
of this ridiculous and pointless
division.
And what of Michael Gove’s
ridiculous idea that art history
is a ‘soft’ subject? It is a sub-
ject that combines a number
of other disciples – knowl-
edge of the politics of the
country and time a work was
produced is invaluable. Scien-
tific developments in the art
of painting form a key part
of the context in which art is
made. Art history engages
our critical thinking and trains
our evaluative faculties. Even
STEM subjects cannot be
divorced from a base of phi-
losophy. Art history is rooted
in the same basis as chemistry
or biology – a deep thirst for
knowledge.
Brexit was a cry of a
number of individuals who felt
they were locked out of the
political arena. What could
be the use of locking them out
of our art galleries too? The
continuation of art education
is vital, not only for members
of our royal family, but for
every person in this country.
By cutting it, we are telling
people that the right to view
art, to engage with it, is noth-
ing more than a ‘privilege’.
The government say that it
is part of school reform, but
all I can see is a move that
will drain our cultural capital,
encourage regional divisions,
and deny people a voice.
