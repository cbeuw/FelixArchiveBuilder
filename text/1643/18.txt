ubism. People
made out of
sharp angles and
brightly coloured
geometric shapes
stacked on each
other in a wild, psychedelic
form of portraiture. This is
what defines Picasso in the
public perception. Picasso’s
portraits at the National
Portrait Gallery certainly
deliver on that front, but far
more intriguingly places his
cubist work in the context
of Picasso’s entire oeuvre
which encompasses a range
wider than certainly I had
anticipated.
The NPG has gathered
together all sorts for this exhi-
bition from huge canvases of
almost Impressionistic work to
doodles on tablecloths, mixed
media collages, sculpture,
and of course his cubist
paintings.
The exhibition, spanning
work from the several
decades of Pablo Picasso’s
career, weaves through his
many phases, and reveals a
great deal of the evolution
of his style and his work.
More importantly perhaps,
it reveals a great deal about
Picasso’s attitudes to women,
to himself, and to other
artists.
We witness the beginning
of a career with cartoons
drawn for friends, these are
scratchy, exaggerated carica-
tures brimming full of life and
character. In another room,
there is the maginificent
Portrait of Sebastià Junyer
i Vidal (1903), a prominent
work from his Blue period.
The figures seem to glow, lit
from within. Running down
the corridor connecting two
gallery spaces are small
collages of unflattering draw-
ings of Picasso’s friend and
assistant, Jaume Sabartés. He
is shown as a small man with
cartoonish bulbous features
leering at gorgeous women:
glamourous actresses cut out
long, straight nose, and the
same almond shaped eyes.
It’s not hard to see why the
goddess of wartime wisdom,
a symbol of strength and
fortitude, might’ve been on
Picasso’s mind at the time. The
Athena motif is recurring. In

from magazines.
Dotted throughout the
rooms are sculptures quite
different from the surreal,
fiercely modern work
exhibited at the Museum of
Modern Art in New York last
year. One in particular stands
out: 1909 bronze Head of a
Woman (Fernande Olivier)
is cubism rendered 3D.
Here, Olivier’s face appears
gnarled, distinctly reptilian,
like plates on a metal suit
of arms or the shell on an
armadillo. Others, more than
anything, reveal the impact
and influence classical art
had on Picasso. Head of
a Woman (Dora Maar),
sculptured during the second
World War in 1941, could be
a bust of Athena lifted straight
from ancient Rome; the same

Ribbon the same features are
present.
Much of this exhibition
revolves around Picasso’s
portrayal of women. An
entire room is dedicated
to Picasso’s paintings of his
first wife, Olga Stepanovna
Khokhlova. The paintings
early on in their relationship
are figurative, traditionally
beautiful. In the 1923 Por-
trait of Olga Picasso, Olga
appears against a plain
background, flatteringly lit.
She looks regal, but there is
a coldness, an aloofness that
is at odds with the wit and joy
in the caricatures of Picasso’s
friends in the cubist paintings.
A later portrait, Woman
in a Hat (Olga), painted
in 1935, the year of their
separation, Olga is replaced
by white and green shapes,
two over-large staring eyes
and uncertain black slash for
a mouth. Atop this forlorn
collection of shapes sits a
large upturned kidney bean
shaped purple hat (Picasso,
it seems, was never a fan of
Olga’s dress sense). Olga, the
woman, has been cut down
and restructured, somehow
made emotionally available
to the viewer. Woman in a
Hat packs much more of an
emotional punch than Portrait
of Olga Picasso, but Olga
has been rendered pitiful.
This room, and the one that
follows, displays Picasso’s
portraits of his subsequent
lovers and wives and serves
only to make clear what
Picasso thought of women.
“There are only two types of
women:” he said, “goddesses
and doormats“. The women,
early on in their acquaintance
with Picasso, appear in figu-
rative paintings or drawings,
goddess-like. They are almost
never looking at the viewer
and are out of reach. As the
women become more familiar
to Picasso they are decon-
structed in the cubist tradition,
pulled apart and re-stitched in
technicolour. They somehow
become more present and at
the same time are abstract,
robbed of their humanity.
Men are almost never given
the same treatment.
The men Picasso paints are
those he respects. He borrows
themes from Matisse, Ingres
and Velasquez, placing
himself in the pantheon of the
European artists.
The most revealing of the
works displayed is a self por-
trait. A small monkey dances
with a grin on its face. This is
how Picasso saw himself, an
impish rebel, even as he was
hailed as one the century’s
greatest artists.
Many have accused Picasso
of rampant misogyny, many
other of genius; this exhibition
displays all these facets
without flinching. The NPG
has gathered together some
rarely seen works. It’s worth
going if only to see what all
the fuss is about.

The Crucible
and the
politics of fear
G
od may be
dead, but
Miller’s legacy
lives on in a
refreshing
take on The
Crucible at Guildhall’s Milton
Court theatre. The Crucible
gives a semi-fictionalised
account of the Salem witch
trails that occurred in
Massachusetts Bay Colony
at the end of the 17th
century.
In an escalating atmosphere
of religious paranoia, mass
hysteria sweeps through
Salem village as bewildered
children ‘confess’ to alleged
crimes of witchcraft and
begin to testify against their
neighbours. The accused are
sentenced to die while the
confessors are rewarded with
impunity.
Written during the second
Red Scare in 1952 the play
is intended as an allegory
of McCarthyism and an
indictment of the House of
Representatives. The conse-
quences of state paranoia of
communism were high; 320
artists were blacklisted on
the basis of unsubstantiated
rumours, and Miller himself
was questioned by the House
Un-American Activities
Committee. In this crucible
of suspicion, all individuals
become subject to unbeara-
ble pressures.
These themes are entirely
pertinent today. One doesn’t
have to look far to see how
terrorism in the 21st
century
breeds vigilance and mistrust.
Nor are we still surprised
that Trump’s jingoisms have
reached the level of fanatical.
Are we experiencing McCa-
rthyism in the modern age?
This was certainly a question
I was pondering as I left the
theatre, a tribute to an immer-
sive performance.
Continuity-wise, the per-
formance does not stray far
from classic interpretations.
In 1953, the play’s first
broadway run received poor
reviews, and Miller chastised
the over-stylised production
and its “pitiless sets of rude
buildings”. The subsequent
re-cast was far less embel-
lished in nature, and this is the
vein in which director Mike
Alfred has conducted the
Guildhall performance.
The production is
Ezra Kitson
minimal. The stage is bare
of everything except a few
wooden benches and props
are used rarely. A backdrop
of knotted rope hangs as an
ominous reminder of the fate
awaiting the accused. There
is no music, and little off-stage
dialogue means the actors on
stage are constantly the focus
of our eyes and ears. The
stage is well lit, contributing to
a lurid atmosphere of disquiet
and surveillance.
The performances are
impressively assured, espe-
cially given the age of the
cast (all final year students
at Guildhall). The pacing is
good and the dialogue felt
authentic and well accented
to reflect the British heritage
of the early pilgrims. Par-
ticular mention should be
given to Caleb Roberts for a
convincing portrayal of John
Procter and Martin Quinn for
the charisma he lent Reverend
Hale. The calibre of talent at
Guildhall is evidently high
and difficult roles such as
Tituba and Marry Warren
were filled seamlessly.
Overall, this is a successful
take on Miller’s work and
a great piece of amateur
theatre. Guildhall tickets are
cheap and the experience is
well worth it. I would encour-
age any fans of theatre to
seek out performances like
this one.
