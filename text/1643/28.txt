VIRGO
This week it’s your
graduation but you
failed to remember
that Imperial is
a money-sucking
vampire and you pay
close to £150 for the
whole boring day. At
least nobody dabbed
at the cerem… oh wait.

ARIES
This week you’re the
Union elections and
are entered twice. I
wish my sex life was
that interesting.
This week you
manage to flood your
lab. You use nearly
1,000 copies of felix to
mop your mess up. You
leave no trace other
than the suspicious
absence of felix from
the South Ken campus.
This week your
girlfriend from home
unexpectedly comes to
visit you in London and
whilst it’s a pleasant
surprise, you were
planning to break up
with her. Oh well. Sex
for breakfast, lunch
and dinner it is.
This week you have
one last chance to
salvage your mess of
a campaign in the final
debate. You decide
that the best cause of
action is not to talk
about the issues but be
racist instead. Works
every time.
This week you realise
you can vote twice in
the autumn elections.
So you contact the
Union and cause
the removal of 73
positions. You just had
to open your mouth,
didn’t you?
This week you fall in
love with a stranger
you meet at a club.
You start picturing
your life together, your
three children, your
pack of dachshunds.
Your fantasy breaks
down when you realise
he’s voting Trump.
This week you
receive a passive
aggressive email that
calls you an ungrateful
immigrant who
doesn’t appreciate the
opportunities he’s been
given. 15K a year
these opportunities
cost.
This week you’re
Boris Johnson and
his leaked ‘Remain’
article. Don’t know how
bad this is? Imagine
actually sending off
your true feelings in
peer assessment instead
of your “showed great
punctuality” one.
This week you wish
that the Harambe
meme would die as
you think the joke
became unfunny a
long time ago. But you
would, wouldn’t you.
You’re no better than
the zookeeper that
shot him.
This week you
wonder whatever
happened to Jedward.
They might have
perished in a great
fire, caused by their
insufferable hair being
held together with
five litres of hairspray
catching fire. They’re
probably at a Butlins.
This week you decide
to hit the careers fair.
You check out Network
Rail but some douche
says that’s no place for
a little lady. Not only
is he sexist he’s also
oblivious to the fact
you’re a thirty year old
man.
CAPRICORN
CRISIS
Chris
Dear Chris,
I’m really not happy with the friends I have made in my
first couple of weeks at halls. None of my two roommates
respect my rampant cocaine use and my kitchen mates do
not share my new love of chinos and bright pink polo shirts
polos. Therefore Chiris I was wondering if you could help
me find some new friends, banker friends. I want someone
who will take me out for a night out and pay for all my
drinks with untattered £50 notes.
So Chris will you help me find my way into this confusing
new world?
Best wishes
Kyle Freer
Hey Ham!
Kyle, I see your problem. Not everyone
finds it easy to form friendships in the busy
confusing world of halls. People who shouldn’t
live together are often pushed together and
made to get along in ways god would not
have intended. So don’t worry, it might not be
totally your fault.
To find new banker friends I would absolutely
start with the degradation of your dangerously
pure morality. It’s hard to fall such a long way
in a small time so start small, by putting the
toilet roll on the wrong way; before slowly
moving up to the heady heights of using up the
last of your kitchen mates marmite.
Once you feel you are suitably degenerate it
is best to move onto creating a single minded
unadultered love of money. Start watching
the Wolf of Wall Street. That film may have
come out last year but the combination of
Leonardo Di Caprio’s beautiful performance
as the dastardly Jordan Belfort along with the
crisp editing of Martin Scorsese combines to
give a satisfying full bodied story that is both
entertaining and informative.
Now that you have watched the Wolf of Wall
Street once, stop, take a moment to gather
your thoughts and start the film again. Now
you will be able to properly enjoy the film,
watching knowing the end of the film (Jordan
goes to prison, #sorrynotsorry) gives the
ensuing screenplay a wonderful pathos which
provides the film an undeniable emotional
impact.
At this point I realise that I haven’t watched the
Wolf of Wall Street for around two days. Soz.
Yours faithfully
Chris
