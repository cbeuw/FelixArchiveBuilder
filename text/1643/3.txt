Alice Gast’s autumn letter
felix reads it so you don’t have to (you’re welcome)

mperial College President,
Alice Gast, released her
autumn letter this week
and set out College’s vision
for the future, a post Brexit
future.
The letter touched on the
fact that (spoiler alert) Brexit
is happening and what the
College plans to do to keep the
status quo as much as possible.
Gast acknowledged that the
vote had “created a great deal
of uncertainty for the College
and for many who work here”
but urged that Imperial had
overcome challenges in the past
and would do again.
With the Government
severing quite a few ties with the
EU, Imperial must continue to
“Think and act internationally”
the letter continued, outlining
the President’s ideas and plans
on immigration, research
collaborations, and corporate
partnerships.
In essence, immigration
involving students and staff is
valuable to the college and
despiteitbeing“Clearthatthere
are going to be restrictions on
the free movement of people”
the College is planning to do all
it can to nudge the government
to keep the borders open as
muchaspossibleforacademics.
Gast proposes that this is
largely going to be achieved
through the increase of visas to
the relevant people, visas she
suggests could be fast tracked
by giving top universities
accreditation. This presumably
gives College a bit more
autonomy as to who they could
hire.
One way touted as a method
tohelpwiththereducedfreedom
of movement is the European
Partners Fund which college
is establishing. £100,000 a
year will be made available
for Imperial academics to
both “develop collaborations
in Europe which lead to new
science and to applications
for external funding”. Slightly
longer term Imperial is planning
to partner up with European
institutions and “pursue bilateral
partnerships”.
Corporate partnerships were
also brought up in the letter and
Imperial are again planning to
try and do as much as possible
to sway government into
policies and actions that help
companies to thrive. Thriving
companies are in the interest of
pretty much most people so this
seems a great idea, how much
sway Imperial will actually have
in consultations (if there even
are any) remains to be see
The letter then takes a more
personal note as Gast almost
urges readers to focus on things
other than Brexit, things which
are more important. “One of
the things that most worries
me about the outcome of the
EU Referendum is the amount
of intellectual energy that
\\ Gast almost
urges readers to
focus on things
other than Brexit,
things which are
more important \\
everyone is expending on this
topic at the cost of other more
forward-looking and positive
things”.
Whilst the referendum has
taken up a decent chunk of
airtime in the past few months, it
has the potential to be a pivotal
moment for both future careers
and research. These will affect
students and academics alike
and a dialogue still needs to be
had.
Imperial’s performance in
the National Student Survey
(NSS) was also mentioned, with
a five percent drop in overall
satisfaction attributed to some
students feeling “unseen and
unheard”. Plans to combat this
were vague but will be “novel,
evidence-based ways of
teaching, fit for a leading STEM-
institution such as ours that can
truly inspire students and staff”.
If teaching methods are the
only way Imperial are planning
on making students feel more
included I wouldn’t bet on our
NSS ranking improving greatly.
The ‘Excellence Fund for
Learning and Teaching
Innovation’ is to be set up to
form a community of teachers
who will play a role in “ Helping
the College to deliver a world-
class educational experience
for all of our students”.
Other funds, grants and
corporate partnerships
(Thomson Reuters and all
round good guys, Nestlé)
were announced as well
as emphasising the strong
links that are being built with
alumni, possibly an outlet that
Imperial are planning to use for
increased funding.
Gast concluded by reiterating
that Imperial is, and would
remain, a global university,
whether this will be the case,
your guess is as good as mine.
You Can Call me Al \\ Imperial
College
“If we are unable to negotiate
a political solution to Brexit that
allows us to fully participate in
European Union funding, we
need to evaluate what elements
of funding and collaboration
are the most important to us.”
Read this as “We might lose a
lot of funding, we need to find
ways to not go broke” (You and
me both, Alice). Again visas
come into this as without people
to collaborate with, there are
no collaborations.
