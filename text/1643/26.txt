How you use it
Cannabis is used in many ways as derivatives
of the cannabis plant. Different strains and
preparations tend to have stronger effects due
to the different amounts of THC contained and
the method of absorption. The most common
way to use cannabis is to smoke it. Unrefined
dried cannabis can be rolled into cigarettes
by itself, or along with tobacco. Hash, a resin
form of cannabis, is often smoked crumbled
into tobacco. Marijuana is famously used in
cooking, traditionally in baked goods, as the
active component is absorbed readily when
dissolved in fats such as butter. Bongs, and
shisha pipes are often used to smoke cannabis,
and word has it that the East London hipsters
are all vaping their weed these days.
Legality
In the UK it is illegal to possess any cannabis. For a first time offence, the police
may issue a Cannabis Warning, which does not show up on criminal record
checks. A Penalty Notice for Disorder, which is an £80 fine, may be issued on
the spot for a second time caught with cannabis, and if this fine is paid promptly,
no criminal conviction is recorded. If you’re caught more than this, you can be
arrested and be given up to five years in prison and an unlimited fine.
Surveys show that although the prevalence of marijuana use has increased to an
all time high, the numbers of arrests and cautions have dropped by around 50%
since 2010. In fact, in County Durham, you can grow small numbers of plants for
your own personal use, and they’ll turn a blind eye.
In many other countries, cannabis is legal. As well as the well known Dutch
coffee shops, some countries including Portugal, the Czech Republic, the USA,
and Uruguay have begun legalising cannabis for recreational or medicinal use
in recent years. Other countries, such as Jamaica and Switzerland allow you to
possess very small amounts for personal use, but forbid its sale or distribution.
Things to do when you’re high
Do
• Watch My Little Pony/cult
movies (that don’t make any
sense except when you’re
high)
• Have sex (although be aware
that having sex under the
influence may lead to poor
decision making, such as
having unprotected sex)
• Explore new and exciting
food combinations (like Prin-
gles with Nutella – that shit
tastes good)
Don’t
• Masturbate (it will be painful
and frustrating)
• Drink (no one wants to
whitey)
• Watch Horror. You will be
terrified, get paranoid and
be unable to sleep
• Do a drug test (duh)
• Generally do not do tasks
that require mental and
physical dexterity, like driv-
ing, performing surgery or
generally go to work

What it does
Cannabis is a depressant drug
whose main psychoactive constitu-
ent is tetrahydracannabinol (THC).
It kicks in within around half an
hour, and makes you feel relaxed,
gives some people the giggles, and
makes most people really hungry.
Your senses may be heightened,
and at times may feel slow. Some
people find that it makes them feel
sleepy and forgetful.
Smoking weed makes some
people feel anxious, and long term
use is associated with psychosis,
hallucinations, and paranoia
in those who are vulnerable to
mental illness.
Some statistics
Cannabis is the most widely used drug in the UK, with 6.9% of adults
aged 16-59 having used it in the last year. Of those who have ever
taken illegal drugs (around one in three adults), 93% of them have
taken marijuana, and for 82% of them, it was the first drug that they
took.
