RUGBY
The first team have continued
their unbroken record with a 14-3 win
against Rosslyn Park A; A 21-5 win
against Charing Cross Hospital, i n
which an early load by Charing X pro-
vided the requisite needle, and finally
last Saturday a 49-0 win against Worth-
ing.
After last Saturday's game the
happiest man in the club was Dick
Coates, the 2nd. team captain. The
team resoundingly defeated the Wasps
4th. XV. No one member can be singled
out as i t was essentially a team effort.
The forwards dominated the loose play
and gained posession of the ball time
after time. The backs, taking advan-
tage of this,set up attack after attack,
swinging the ball smoothly along the 1
line. Pour tries came from the wing
threequarter3, and a further one by a
cross-kick from the wing. In short ,
the team 'clicked' and the result was
an exhilarating game both to play in
and to watch.
The junior teams are meeting
with mixed success but are suffering
from the weakening caused by injury and
unavailability higher up.

Wed. Oct. 28th.
The first match of the season was
against Reading University. The final
result was a win for Reading by 15 bouts
to 10. This result, however, belies
the actual close nature of the individ-
ual bouts.
The Sabre win was promising as
this is the first time in recent years
that we have fielded a sabre team.
The results are:-

The first weeks of the new season
have been very fortunate ones for the
I.C.H.C. They have brought with them
suocess in several spheres of the clubs
activities
Increased support has enabled a
regular 4th. XI to be fielded on Sat-
urdays, and the rapidity with which the
places in the Sunday mixed XI are f i l -
led surpasses even the most popular of
last years matches. This was a long-
to-be-remembered fixture with Messrs.
G-uiness and Son. Ltd. (away)
Competition for the 1st. XI has
become keener this year and apart from
the obvious advantage to the team itself
this has also added greatly to the pres-
tige of the 2nd.XI. A recent feather
in the oap of the 1st. was their con-
vincing defeat of the U.L. 2nd. by 4
goals to 1.
The importance of the regular 4 th.
XI,to the higher teams and the club in
general, cannot be overstressed and i t
is very gratifying to see the keenness
with which i t is being supported. The
promise of financial assistance from
the A.C.C. has made i t possible to ar-
range regular fixtures for this team,
and i t is only to be regretted that
because of lack of club funds they will
have to play in white shirts.
For the record:- The 1st. XI
have won 4, drawn 1, and lost 1, scor-
ing 16 goals and conceding only 5.
I C WIN GALA
At a swimming match at New Cross,
I.C. were comfortable winners with 68
pts.; Kings were second with 51 pts.,
and Goldsmiths third with 19 points.
I.C. won the Medley Relay, and were
second in the Freestyle relay. The
Harford-Loveman combination again sec-
ured firsts in the back and breast re-
spectively, whilst newcomer Shorey made
an impressive debut in winning the
butterfly. These swimmers were ably
supported by Wilson, Hills, Alloook,
Webb and Poet. On the results of the
Gala, two freshers, Allcock and Wilson
were chosen for the University second
team.
The Polo teams have not been so
successful. The first team has under-
taken an ambitious programme against
strong London League opposition, and
have so far not quite made the grade.
The experience gained from this higher
class polo will undoubtedly prove ben-
eficial eventually. The match against
Southgate Tl was lost 5-0 and that
against Stoke Newington 9-2, Hart and
Mears scoring for I.C.
The second team, consisting mainly
of freshers, has lost i t s first two
matches, both by the odd goal, and i t
appears as i f we can expect better
results in the future. At Malet st..,
they lost 8-7 to L.S.E., with Larson 4
Wilson 2, and Levering scoring. In
their first home match they lost 2-3
to N.E.C. with Wilson and Lover-ing
scoring.
CROSS COUNTRY.
At Mitoham on Oct. 22nd. the
team result was :- 1st. I.C.(l) 116;
2nd. Kings 141; 3rd. L.S.E. 282; 4th.
I. C.(2) 301. This was a '
m
o
b match'
to which each college took as many men
as possible and the great numerical
strength of I.C. is shown by the fact
that we finished a second team of 10
men^hich no other college in London
appears able to do. The first I.C.
men home were:- 1. John Collins, 2.
A Larkum, 5.J.Bernard, 9. A.Brown,
II. M. Barber, 12. G.Tilly Collins'
time for the rather wet 6^ mile course
was 34:23.
Sat. 25th. Oct. was the date of
the University trials, over 63 miles
at Hampstead, and I.C.C.C.C. made no.
mistake in showing the University which
is the best college, having six men in
the first nine. They were:- 2. J.Coll-
ins, 4 . D.Briggs, 5. A.Larkum, 7. J .
Cleater 8. A.Brown, 9. J-F Jaeger.
Looking at these results we can be rea-
sonably confident about the U.L.Champs,
It will be interesting to see whether
our second team can beat any of the
'big five' college first teams!
Four days after the trials,
Borough Road College were our guests at
Petersham for a match with I.C.(2) and
I.C.(3). The team result was:-
1. I.C.(2) 43 pts.
2. Bor. Rd. 78 pts.
3. 1.0.(3) 130 pts.
The first I.C.men home were:- I.G.Tilly
(29:51); 2. J.Bernard (29:54); 4. P.
Rayment (30:54). It i s interesting to
see that a l l the scoring men in the I.C.
third team finished ahead of the last
scoring Borough Road man.
Last Saturday the U.L. teams ran
against Cambridge, and I.C. provided 3
men in each team. The U.L. first team
uffered a heavy defeat, however the
U.L. second team were more successful.
On the same day a much weakened I.C.
team travelled to Hayes where they
narrowly lost to Lloyds Bank, but de-
feated Lensbury A.C.
1. Lloyds 42; 2. I.C. 49; 3. Len-
sbury 103: I.C. positions were:
5. G.Tilly, 6. M.Barber, 8.J.Pernard,
9. P.Rayment, 10. Manson, 11. Clifton,
1 2. Hammonds.
SQUASH CLUB
The first team have made an
impressive start to the season and,
to date, have maintained a 10(35 record.
The team shows great promise and
should have i t s most successful seas-
on for several years. C.R. Evans, the
first string has been selected for the
university 1st V and i t i s also hoped
that we will supply two members of the
University 2nd V.
On our two visits to Cambridge
we beat Sidney Sussex 3 to 2 on
October 18th and Vueen's 4 to 1 on
November 1st. Other successes gain-
ed have been over our old rivals U.C.
by 4 to 1 and S.O.A.S. by 5 to 0.
The second team i s s t i l l rather
unsettled and, after starting the seas-
on with a good win over R.V.C. 1 st V,
lost narrowly to U.CH. It i s hoped
that when the team becomes settled i t
will prove to have a record comparable
with that of the 1st.
