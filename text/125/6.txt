6 FELIX
ROUND t, ABOUT
by Romulus
In & few days time i t will be
Morpby Day. This is the only official
rag at I.C., so dress sensibly, arm
yourselves with flour, come along and
join In the fun.
Last week R.C.S. with due pomp
and oeremony christened their new mas-
cot 'Theta' in the middle of Imperial
Institute Road in a bath of flames.
This i s now the chief trophy and will
stand on a par i n rags with Guild's
'Spanner' and Mines' 'Mich'.
2** VARIATION
by Sig
ON A THEME
After my last scribblings, many
have asked "what are you trying to do ?",
some "what are you?" and many just "what?1
Those I must answer are those who ask
"why are you here?".
As a student in Social Insanity
wherebetter could I have come for my
Postidiocy Course? Your fame has spread
like syrup on a bathroom floor and i t
is my intention to comment on the more
interesting things to be found within
(and on) your walls.
There are Interesting types too,
those who, never having seen a woman
before, behave as the zoologist with a
new specimen - they try pickling as a
means of investigation; those who, over-
come by the novelty of work are never
heard of again. Some have 3aid that a
Balanced Student exists somewhere - I
doubt i t . If he did, he would be as
obvious as a member of staff at a
student function.
Idiots abound, to be sure - the
"Do-it-yourself" craze ensures that;
"Teach yourself Schizophrenia" i s the
moat borrowed book, the Encyclopedia
Moronioa the standard reference.
No wonder the French refer to you as
"L'universite" - pronounced "Looney-
versity."
The lecturers here (the "nut-
crackers" ) have the task of instilling
utterly obscure nonsense into deaf minds.
This i s celled Education. Education is
to teach you wright and wrong. Thus, i t
is wright to quote the Prof.'s theories
when talking to him, but wrong (and
absurd) to apply them to the solution
of a problem.
Usually my watch and the clocks
in the Union are at a alight variance
with each other. The Union clocks
which are a l l electric, appear to be
two minutes ahead of G.M.T. Appar-
ently this is intentionally done to en-
sure that students get to lectures on
time. I wonder whether this means
that the bar opens a few minutes be-
fore time - and worse than that perhaps
the bar closes before i t i s absolutely
neoessaryi
Whenever I go to my pigeon-hole
in the letter rack I have to wade
through piles of old letters. I won-
der i f Messrs. Raine, Ramsay and Rees
know how many letters are awaiting them.
For a certain Mr. Remus in Guilds, there
awaits three invitations to freshers'
teas, some Commemoration Day literature,
a letter telling him to be a good boy
on Nov. 5th, a dirty postcard from
Blackpool, an unsigned Union Card, and
a couple of scented letters.
PCS
ASSOCIATION
The R.C.S. Association Intend to
make this year, their Jubilee, a memor-
able one. At the Annual Dinner on
Thursday, 27th November, the Guest of
Honour i s to be Sir Andrew McCanoe,
F.R.S., whose links with the Imperial
College date from 1908, the foundation
year of the Association. It i s also
hoped to have present some of the fami-
ly of H.G. Wells, the Association's
founder and first president.
BO DRIVING ALONG THE BRIGHTON FRONT
AFTER THE ANNUAL LONDON-BRIGHTON RUN
LADY LUCK
An occupation for whioh ICWA are
not usually renowned is gambling. I am
not suggesting any full-scale nocturnal
poker sessions, although the smoke-laden,
coffee-stained atmosphere generally as»
sociated with the third floor would be
most conducive to such activities,
refer rather to the football pools.
Perhaps lack of success has accoun-
ted for the ommission of this pastime
from the annals of ICWSC. However, th
their efforts have at last borne fruit -
an emminent mathematician has won the
fabulous sum of £18 - 10 - the culmin-
ation, one suspects, of many hours of
intense concentration over perms and
combs, with slide-rule, black coffee and
(dare one suggest it) a few pins?
So now the I.C. males will not only
expect coffee from the tender hands of
our beloved maidens, but also an accurat
forecast of Saturday's vital statistics.

phrase - "the Prof, can't insult me,
I'm too ignorant " i s indicative of the
