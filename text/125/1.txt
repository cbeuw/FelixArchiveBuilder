and Bedford have a l l suffered at the hands of "trigger happy" raiders. Westfield's
Penguin mascot "Honeysuckle" was taken for a ride, as was the Q

A group of N.E.C. students, official guardians of "Honeysuckle", tried to re-
capture the penguin on the same day that i t was due to be returned, but were succes-
fully repulsed by a band of Guildsmen. This incident was followed by a visit from
a few fire engines and police cars, again arriving too late to participate. Fear-
ing further attacRs, an incongruous escort of vehicles in varying stages of disrepair,
accompanied "Honeysuckle" home.
She was borne in mourning into the
precincts of Westfield while Guildsmen
choroused a sordid version of "John
Brown's Body". The afternoons enter-
tainment terminated with a "Boomaleka"
but not before the ever-pre3ent, ever-
dangerous mob-instinct had reared i t s
ugly head, in trying to force an entry
into Vfestfield. H

An amusing sequel to this was the

who got 'carried away' by the whole
affair and a load of crafty Guildsmen,

B y far the most enterprising " l i f t "
was that of the Sandhurst Cannon11
.
Three visits were made to the R.M.A.
Sandhurst and a number of reconnaisances
indicated that the cannon was a"likely
take". The first raid, late on Sat-
urday, October 25th, ended unsuccess-
fully to a chorous of police whistles
and racing engines. Two nights later
with the gun carriage already hitched
to one of the cars, the party was
surprised by the brilliant lights of
a police car which immediately gave
chase,until the students' car was forced
to stop when the gun carriage (about
15 cwt) assumed complete control.
Undeterred by these failures they
returned next night, towed the cannon
away without trouble/, pausing only to
decorate the back with a t a i l lamp and
number plate. Arriving at Maidenhead
they left the cannon outside a cemetery
to await collection later, as its wheels
were becoming unservioable. However

RECTOR S SPEECH
There are 2,580 students at tile
Imperial College of Science and Tech-
nology this session, of whom 1,650 are
undergraduates and 930 postgraduates.
This was announced by Dr. R.P. Linstead,
Rector of the College, at the annual
Commemoration Day ceremony held in the
Royal Albert Hall, at which Lord Bridges
was the Special Visitor. The College
plan for expansion, made some years ago,
set a total of 2,550 students as the
target for 1959/60, and the College
is therefore one year ahead of i t s plan
in so far as numbers are concerned.
Six new Professors and twelve new
Readers have been appointed during the
year; eight of these are new posts est-
ablished by the University of London,
and they represent new academic develop-
ments *in a number of fields, including
applied electron physics, heat transfer,
nuclear technology and physical oceano-
graphy.
The first stage of the very
large new Engineering block (on which
a unique experiment in structural beh-
aviour i3 being conducted by the Civil
Engineering Department) is going forward*
The new Physics building in Prince Con-
sort Road is also in course of construc-
tion. Both should be completed by the
end of 1959- Weeks Hall, the first new
Hall of Residence, made possible by the
generosity of Vickers Limited, is under
construction in Prince's Gardens and will
be ready for occupation next session.
Site clearance on the South and East,
sides of Prince's Gardens is under way;
approval has been given to build on the
South side four Halls of Residence and
new refectories; building i s expected
to start in the summer of 1959-

The R.C.3, Union meeting of Thurs-
day, October 30th was held in the Main
Physics Theatre - a room denied to the
Union before because of the series of
incidents which marred previous meetings
This time, however, President Peter
Kassler, presided over one of the most
orderly and well-behaved assemblies
in recent years.
The election of the "Queen of
Jezebel" an honour that finally fell
to Xandra of Chemistry - was the item
that really aroused enthusiasm, while
the naming of the thermometer, a blue-
pencilled affair, resulted in the choice
of "Theta", bestowed with due ceremony
after the meeting, on board Jez in the
Imperial Institute Road.
A motion "that this house believes
that the R.C.S. Union should secede
from the I.C. Union" gave an opportunity
for wit and ingenuity - the response
was not disappointing! Mr. John
Swingler began the motion in a l l seriou-
sness, but the riotous opposing plea
by Mr. Eddie Fersht caused a startling
change in the mood of the house.
This was in no way damped by the antics
of Mr. John Forster, who, disguised
as a soothsayer hinted at dark
"behind-the-scenes" activities by R.C.S.
Union Officials.
Ifhen some order had been restored,
the motion was defeated by 176 votes to
l6l - i t remains to be seen what the
M.C. Union meeting has to say about
R.C.S.
A full-throated and rousing
Kangella(revised version) brought
the official business of thi3 most
satisfactory meeting to a close.
