FELIX 7
BASKETBALL
Although a n innovation to Imp-
erial College's athletio representation
Basketball shows signs of being one of
its strongest assets. Similarly the
entry of an I.C. team into the U.L. Le-
ague competition was a new venture and
a worthy one, so far.
Scheduled to play Wesminster Col-
lege on Wed. 15th. Oct., we were denied
the first taste of victory because of
a last-minute hitch.- the opposition
failed to turn up! - and we had to wait
until the following Saturday before we
made our debut.
The team that we were due to
play, like ourselves, were newcomers
to the League, and the match had, on
paper, a l l the ingredients of a fine
struggle. However, this was not to,bo,
the Northern Polytechnic never troubled
I.C., being unable to equal the speed
and thrust of our attack, or resolute
ness of our defence. The score at
half-time reflected this with I.C.
leading by 27 points to 7 points. In
the seoond half we again proved our
superiority and finally beat a very
despondent team by 68 points to i6,to
register our first win.
The Club's next opponents,
Goldsmith's College,could have pro-
ved a stumbling block, for only the
previous week had they been narrow-
ly defeated by D.C., one of last
years strongest teams, by the small
margin of two pointsj With a few
minutes of the first half gone, things
were grim, because I.C. were ten
points down and had yet to score.
Luckily though they acclimatised
themselves to the gym, and by half
time had taken command of the game,
having a lead of ten points. The
second half proved rather robust and
tempers became heated but despite all
this I.C. won by 50 to 28.
Our next match resulted in a
much closer fight, and i t was not
until the second half that I.C. got the
better of L.S.E. The final score was
53 to 22.
A great percentage of this
suocess goes to I.C-'s captain, Jack
Fryer, who has been top scorer in a l l
three matches. His grand total now
stands at 66 points out of 151
points. Mike Barron ( with 32 points)
and Tony Hird ( with 31 points ) have
also played well in attack, while Steve
Robertson has performed well in defence.
Before ending this report, I
should like to mention that like a l l
new ventures Basketball is having i t s
teething troubles, but more support
oonld eliminate these. You do not
have to be 7 feet t a l l , (though i t is
a great assetl), and lack of inches i s
no disadvantage. So why not come along
to the Gymnasium any Thursday after
lectures.
.JUDO
I.C. Judo dub had a good start
to their season, when they comfortably
defeated the Royal Military College,
Sandhurst, in a home match held on Wed-
nesday, the 22nd of October.
I.C, won 5 bouts and drew 2 out
of 7.

The series of five Guilds Fresher's
Dinners, completed last Friday, constit-
uted something of a marathon for the
organisers, the last being held i n the
aftermath of the O
o
m
m
e
m
. Day Ball.
The dinners were held departmentally
this year whioh gave an interesting
demonstration of departmental character
from the Civils, solid and oonvivial
from comnunal activity at Silwood, to the
Chemical, almost barbaric in their im-
maturity, so that even the presence of
Professor Dankwerts G.M. could command
l i t t l e respect.
The President repeated metre or less
the same speech on a l l five occasions,
his success varying with the relative
barbarity of the audiences.
Humour was usually forthcoming from
one or other of the speakers but the
President made no formal efforts i n this
direction; no doubt feeling that five
successive recitations of the unauthor-
ised version of "Daniel i n the Lions Den"
in the bar afterwards were sufficient
penance. Certain regular inhabitants
of the bar seemed to share this view.
On each occasion the Spanner was recei-
ved with great enthusiasm, proceedings
being closed with the traditional
"Boomalaka".
After the first Friday dinner, the-
Spanner was taken on an outing to Bed-
ford College by a group of Civils under
the leadership of Jolyon Howe.
Bedford's Social Secretary expres-
sed her desire to dance with the Spanner
rather than the President, but compromi-
sed by dancing with both, after being
told that the spanner can't dance.
Laurels are due to Peter Foster of
the Old Centralians for his smooth and
witty speaking at the first dinner and
to the three Freshers who replied to
toasts at very short notice.

MOTORING
COLUMN
Eleven R.C.S. men assembled outside
Jes's garage at 7 a.m. on the wet morn-
ing of Sunday, Nov. 2nd. to undertake
what 50 years ago would have been a
perilous journey - a trip from London
to Brighton. Jex behaved perfectly, do-
ing a steady 20 m.p.h. up and down hills
- a l l top gear work.
She pulled up at a garage for petrol
when Bo' passed, sounding extremely heal-
thy. He was soon overtaken toethe sounds
of the fire-bell. There was another stop
for coffee and warmth before Brighton
was reached in a very good time. Bo'
arrived half an hoar later, having had
a trouble-free - i f somewhat wet - jour-
ney.
After a wash and dry-up in the Cor-
poration Boiler house, the crew moved to
Clarges Hotel for an excellent dinner
with the Guilds Moter Club. In the mean
time the Dennis' Apprentices' fire eng-
ine had arrived on the front. This is a
machine similar to Jez, built in 1914 ,
s t i l l complete with pump, but fitted
with pneumatic tyres.
Bo' took part in the parade of the
Veterans after which she set out with
Jez and an attending convoy of Guilds-
men for the White Horse in Dorking. As
Bo' had to have frequent stops to change
plugs, Jez continued on her own, arriv-
ing in Dorking an hour before Bo'.
Sixteen damp hours after starting
Jezebel returned to College with the
male choir going strong a l l the way
from Dorking.
