BEYOND A JOKE
Dear Sir,
X fear that the common habit of
taking objects, of no intrinsic value,
as souvenirs is becoming out of hand.
The idea i s spreading, so that ash trays
glasses, decorations, eto. oan be re-
moved with a dear oonoience i f the
word 'souvenir' i s mentioned. These
objects can often be quite expensive
to replace; in the eyes of the taker,
however, it's a l l good 'sport',
The stage has been reached when
the more souvenirs one has in one1
s
room, the 'better' fellow one is con-
sidered to be. At the moment, any ob-
ject whioh a student would like is va-
lidly his i f he has the ingenuity to
remove i t without being oaught.
The lowest level has now been
reached. At a i irty on Friday 17th.
Oot. in the Garden Hostel, a lady's
white,leather handbag was removed from
one of the rooms. The theft of the bag
containing a watch etc. represents a
serious loes to the owner.
Taking things from pubs and Lon-
don Transport may appear to be unnotice-
able in such large organisations, how-
ever, the theft of property worth about
£20 from a fellow-student is not.
I normally feel proud of I.C.
when I bring guests here. On this oc-
casion I felt thoroughly ashamed to be
associated with i t .
Yours sincerely

GRIEVANCE
Dear Sir,
for tonight we'll merry
merry be, tomorrow we'll be sober." I
am a l l in favour of an evening spent '
' out on the beer ' - and appreciate
more than most the value of fresher's
dinners. Is i t , however, necessary to
bawl obscene language in the quadrangle
after the bar oloses, when the offenders
are virtually in mixed company? How ash-
amed would these seemingly ill-bred
ahouters be i f they were to discover
that their fathers or mothers were
watching and listening from, say, a
hostel window. How would they like, as
hostel oleaners have to, to clean a
bathroom in whioh someone had vomit-
ted en the shower and in the bath?
Until the vast majority learn to
take their drink as do gentlemen( or
ge back to tha gutter where they have
earns from), the College will remain un-
like part of a University.
Yours faithfully,
John Bramley.
IMPERIAL EXPANSION
Dear Sir,
At the recent R.C.S. union meeting
a motion was narrowly rejected which
proposed a more towards the secession
of the R.C.S. union from the I.C. union.
However I feel that such a proposal
should not be summarily dismissed.
The Imperial College Union i s
expanding at a rate such that i t will
shortly be composed of over 3,000
members. It is inevitable that as
sn institution is enlarged, the posi-
tion of the individual must decline.
The sports clubs, too, are becom-
ing too large and unwieldy and equally
good, i f not better, results would be
obtained by the constituent college
clubs.
Looking to the future, much has
been spoken and written regarding the
establishment of Kensinrrton University,
bringing other colleges into federation
with our own. They are more likely
to feel on a par with us i f we exist
a3 R.S.M., C. & G., and R.C.S., than,
as we now appear, the mammoth Imperial
College.
I am not proposing the immediate
dissolution of all ties between the
I.C., what I am saying is that sooner
or later we must face the problem of
our excessive size and complex con-
stitution and that now is the time to .
start thinking in anticipation.
Yours faithfully,
Brian Smalley.
FLESH OUT OF WATER
Dear Sir,
Many of your readers will agree
with me that D. L.'s article "Suocess at
I.C. " printed in your last issue, con-
siderably lowered the tone of your other-
wise excellent newspaper.
Whilst his appellation of "goon-like
brownbagger" leaves me unmoved, his jibe
at the expense of the Underwater swimm-
ing Club cannot go unremarked. Like
many non-athletic egotists Mr. D.L.
directs his sneers at the healthier act-
ivities at College. If he oould be per-
suaded to foresake the more sordid pleas-
ures of the flesh one Monday evening, I
would invite him to judge for himself
why i t i s that the Union supports
underwater swimming at I.C.
Yours faithfully,
Norman Crossland,
President
Underwater Club.
BLEEDING HEARTS
To a l l students who are suffering
from troubles affecting the heart
or any other reason, now have the
opportunity to tell your plaintive
stories to Aunt Hetty of Bedford
News who will answer them in her
column. Identities will not be re-
vealed.
NELSON'S COLUMN
Zoologists at I.C. have recently-
been engaged in investigating the fasci-
nating spread of the dreaded Oriental
Flu through the hostel. Before the gr-
aphs and statistics so obtained are pub-
lished for the scientific world - in
"The Foul Pest Fancier's Weekly", i t i s
possible to describe the gist of their
findings.
The germ spread like boredom
through the Hostel, passing from Pres-
ident to President (indicating its
chronic nature). Those who came to
oomfort the more attractive Official
soon passed i t on to others. This was
particularly the case with those who
have regular and personal contacts with
I.CW.A. - thus insuring its rapid spr-
ead along the corridor. By plotting the
course of the malady, some very interest-
ing inferences can be made. It is under-
stood that personal threats made to the
investigators will be ignored unless
accompanied by cash.
The wife of the Mines Entert-
ainment's Officer is, we hear, expect-
ing a baby.
The wife of the last year's
also had a baby while her husband held
offioe.
Is this entertainment going to
become a habit?

"The Sunday Express"
Nov. 2nd 1958
"Kensington girls by tradition,
breeding, training, and temperament
are as genteel,stodgy and utterly
respectable mothers-to-be as can be
found in any postal district Oh the
globe".
N.H.S.
On Sunday morning, November 2nd,
ten members of the Society (suitably
Clad) met on Epsom Downs for the first
field excursion of this academic year.
Led by Bob Sturrock, the party went over
the Downs to Headley Village where i t
paused for lunch. It then continued
over the Heath and approached Box Hill
from the north-east, and most members
finished the day descending the scarp
by the shortest vertical route.
Despite the continual rain, the
party really enjoyed (we are assured)
the fresh air.
