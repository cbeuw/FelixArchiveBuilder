2 FELIX
LORD BRIDGES
ADDRESS
The theme chosen by Lord Bridges
for his Co-sBeracration Day Address was
a survey of the qualities which he
considered counted most in the lives of
nan and women who use their brains.
The first quality was intense
enthusiasm for ones work - the beginning
of wisdom of the highest virtue. Sec-
ondly, oame intellectual honesty, and
hare Lord Bridges oorrellated the ar-
t i s t and the scientific man. Further,
this honesty applies with equal force
to high administrative work. The
third quality is the ability to handle
people, a question both of sympathy
and understanding, but trained and dis-
ciplined to an unusual degree; i t is
the type of qualities found in a Minis-
ter.
Lord Bridges next considered phy-
sical qualities, for example, having a
â€¢thick skin, and the ability to sleep,
but considered that there were Import-
ant to a lesser degree.
Finally, there is the question of
a good conscience, by which he meant
a reasonably obedient and well trained
conscience, enabling one to admit ones
mistakes, and then help to forget about
them.
Summarizing, Lord Bridges considered
the following qualities to matter-
enthusiasm, interlectual honesty, and
sympathy with people, which can be per-
sued and disciplined to a point at which
i t reaches a very acute understanding
of the thoughts and feelings of those
with whom one has to deal.
Lord Bridges attributed the success
of most distinguished men to their
developing these fine qualities, after
the age when most men have ceased to
do so.
Finally, although the forces of
mass opinion and mass entertainment
are tending to make i t more difficult
for young people to look hard into
their own "rfwu and develop those qual-
ities outlined above, i t would be better
for the future of learning and industry
i f more people oould do so.
GENERAL STUDIES
S/M/LE AND
METAPHOR
For his talk on '519010 and Met-
aphor*, Patric Dickinson began by ask-
ing his audience what was meant by a
"red herring: was i t a flase t r i a l ,
or was i t caught?
This led on to the problem of what
'red* means. Blood is red, but i n
the Middle Ages i t was called blue,
red and brown on different occasions:
to some people a red admiral is a butt-
erfly, to a politician i t has another
significance. Such varying associat-
ions of a word are inevitable since
words are only a form of communication,
limited in scope, while people's im-
agination is visual and limitless.
Similes and metaphors are basic
to human communication as a means of
comparison: their use in poetry is to
enable the poet to pack the ma r\ mum
amount of material in, and not just to
be obscure. Much i s lost when a poem
is analysed - "we murder to dissect",
said Wordsworth - for each person has
a single response: the better the
poem, the better the responses, but
they will vary a great deal.
Most similes belong to the pre-
machine age - "My love is like a red
red rose", "holy smoke", "tight as a
tick": would a g i r l take i t as a oom-
pliment to be told "my love is like a
piece of pre-stressed concrete"?
Since poetry is to oonvey emotions
and thoughts, the material used must
be appropriate to such ideas, on any
level which the author requires.
In Victorian days, the basis of
poetry was essentially romorce, epito-
mised by the flowers, the open fields
and the sky: consider the scene set
by Keats, which would be nothing with-
out the use of the simile.
"Let us go then, you and I,
With the evening spread out against the
sky
Like a patient etherised on a table."

The second mascot to visit I.C. this
term was removed from Westfield College
on Friday, October 24th, by four Guilds-
men. Looking suitably dressed for the
young ladies of the establishment, but
lacking only a bunch of flowers, two of
the party entered "The Bey", where the
penguin was kept, just before 3 p.m.
After 25 harrowing, nerve-racking
minutes waiting for the ooast to dear
they emerged at a brisk pace, carrying
the body between them. Jumping into
the waiting oar they were whisked away
without being seen.
Contrary to the reports in a cer-
tain news-sheet the raid took place
during a public lecture at the oollege,
which started two hours later; neither
did they lurk around the main entrance,
but entered openly.

INTERNATIONAL
EVENING
Chop-sticks and sheepskins, Arabia
delicacies and Canadian Gold,a Hula
Hoop and a Tuju mask were among the
articles displayed on the National
tables at the international Evening.
This was organised on Hallow'een by the
International Relations Club.
Bert Barney, a Canadian, Ming Leung,
a Chinese, Said Tarha, an Arab and Tern
Molnai a Hungarian formed a Brains Trust
and gave interesting answers to stimulat-
ing questions from the audience.
Danny Kaye's film "Assignment Child-
ren " introduced a specialised section
of the United Nations, TJNICEF. The work
of the U.N. waa thoroughly and generally
oovered by Mr. Terry Lawson of the C.EW.C.
a devoted worker for the U.N. i n this
country, who had been a member of the sec-
retariat during the Hun -arian crises. His
serious talk was punctuated with personal
anecdotes which brought our attention to
the importance of personal contact in the
field of multilateral diplomacy. No formal
questions were asked but Mr. Lawson later
spent a busy hour discussing various
questions with some of the students.
The "International Open Sandwiohea*
whioh are fast becoming a feature of
these evenings disappeared rapidly, as
did the wine, whioh was of a higher
standard than previously.
The evening was more serious than
formerly and the proportion of foreign
students was notioeally higher.
The committee of the International
Relations Club would like to thank the
Chinese and Arab Societies and the indiv-
idual Canadians and Africans and everyone
else who helped to make the Evening so
successful.
