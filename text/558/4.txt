(costing only about a pound each) o n 25th July. Like last year this
it will coincide with the last day of the Cambridge Beer Festival.

any of the P G G r o u p Committee members or departmental P G
reps. In any case notices will be put up giving detailed information

Silwood o n 27th June. T h e charge would be £1.50 per person ant
will entitle each ticket holder to two drinks (real ale or wine)

phone u p C h r i s Endacott o n Silwood 240 during the day or on
A s c o t 23911 ext 9 in the evenings. Y o u would probably have to
m a k e your o w n travel arrangements.
JCR In The Summer
H e r e is a w o r d of w a r n i n g to those P G s w h o m a y get into
arguments with the D a y Bookings people in the J C R during the
s u m m e r vacations. T h e J C R D O E S N O T belong to the U n i o n
during the summer vacations. It is hired out to people by College and
"•he U n i o n gets two-thirds of the revenue. S o don't get unduly
p e r t u r b e d w h e n y o u find the J C R being used by conference
delegates while y o u may think they are taking over facilities which
first a n d foremost belong to ycJb rightfully. D u r i n g the summer
v a c a t i o n s they don't. S o please bear these facts i n m i n d as
arguments such as the ones pointed .to above have in the past led
to a reduction in the revenue to the U n i o n from hiring out the
J C R .
M Phil/PhD Supervision
In the last instalment of P G Tips y o u were informed about what
the G r a d u a t e S t u d i e s C o m m i t t e e w a s d o i n g a b o u t e n s u r i n g
proper supervision of research students. Well the efforts have
proved to be fairly successful a n d as of n o w at least eighteen
departments in the College either already have or have agreed to
take one or more of the following steps to ensure the welfare of
research students: (i) appointing a P G staff/student committee; (ii)
a p p o i n t i n g a P G t u t o r ; (iii) a p p o i n t i n g a n ' a d v i s o r ' t o e a c h
research student in addition to his/her supervisor; (iv) appointing
a thesis committee to regularise transfer from M Phil to P h D ; (v)
limiting the number of students under one supervisor at any one
time, a n d (vi) having an annual review of the research students in
the department.
MSc Nuclear Fuel Technology
Y o u w o u l d p e r h a p s r e m e m b e r that the safey aspects of this
course were discussed in these columns before. But more serious
than that is the fact that the College has no policy regarding
restricting admission of students from countries that have not
signed the N u c l e a r Non-Proliferation Treaty to this course. This I
think is a rather pathetic situation. Considering that it is very
debatable as to which aspects of nuclear technology can be used
for civil purposes a n d which for military, it would only seem
prudent to take adequate policy measures to restrict admission to
this course.
Over And Out
In this last instalment of P G Tips I would like to mention the
names of those w h o devoted a considerable amount of their time
to the activities of the P G G r o u p . T h e y are F r a n k J a m e s , Peter
Mitchell, Steve G u n n a n d J o h n Whitehouse. T h e y deserve the
thanks of all P G s for the effort they put in.
