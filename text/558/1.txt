Shakuntala Devi, the woman who
can mulitply- faster than a
computer, visited IC on Wednes-
day. She solved the above thirteen
by thirteen digit multiplication in 28
seconds!
Besides performing multiplications,
Shakuntala demonstrated her skills
at finding roots of large numbers.
She calculated the 5th
root of
69343957 in a few seconds.
In between calculations many
students in the packed Maths
Lecture Theatre asked her to
name the day of the week on
which they were born. Immediately
after they announced their date of
birth, Shakuntala gave the correct
answer.
Habemus Imperatrem

The Ner-a-Car is a 1925 vintage
motorcycle belonging to City and
Guilds College Union which has
been restored over the past year.
Yesterday, after standing motion-
less for twenty-five years, the Nur-
a-Car once again burst forth into
life. It completed several circuits of
College before retiring for a well
earned rest.
Whipped
Last week a group of students
from Q E C took the 'Whipping Post
Lane' road sign from the Union
Bar. They managed to un out of

Rescue
The Union transport fleet ran into
more problems this week when the
Cricket Club tour was stranded in
Bristol.
T h e traditional end-of-season
tour to the West Country ran into
difficulties on the first day. T h e
team set off from College early on
T u e s d a y morning for their first
match in Bristol.
By mid-afternoon, the Club was
forced to call the Union'for help.
It seems that the Union Transit
c r e w b u s had a c r a c k e d engine
block and that it was not possible
to continue using the vehicle for
the rest of the tour. H o w e v e r ,
Chris Fox and Martin Watson leapt
to the rescue and took a Union
landrover down the M4.
So, not only has Union Transport
been badly hit this year by crashes,
breakdowns and a financial crisis,
but Cricket Club are still bedevilled
by bad luck.
T h r o u g h o u t the s u m m e r , bad
weather has led to many cancella-'
tions; and when the sun shone, the
opposition cancelled. Unfortunately,
this breakdown and the current
heavy rain means that there seems to
be no change in fortunes for the
team.
