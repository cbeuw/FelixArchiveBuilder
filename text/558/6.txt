The Royal Mail is moving
into a new era of change.
We are committed to an
intensive programme of
modernisation with the
two-fold aim of providing a
better guality of service and
wider opportunities for
• men and women in the
industry.
A Major Force
The Royal Mail is already a
major force in the country's
communications network.
Its staff of 172,000 men and
women ensure that well over
30 million letters and
parcels are delivered every
working day through a.
national system of sorting
offices; and they run some
23,000 counters and 25,000
vehicles between them,
providing a complex range
of postal, banking, licensing
and other services.
We are now looking for
more men and women
graduating in Electrical and
Electronic Engineering, as
well as in Mechanical
Engineering, to join our key
group in London which is
spearheading our drive
towards greater speed and
efficiency.
We are designing the devices to
monitor the more unusual character-
istics of letter mail — e.g. stiffness,
opacity, colour.

Opportunities For Talent
In addition to having, or
expecting, a good Honours

practical — because our
projects require practical
solutions. You must like
seeing work through —
because you'll stay with a
project from inception to
completion. And your
approach must be adaptable
— because you'll no doubt
be part of a multi-discipline
team.
Starting salary is between
£5,400 and £8,800,
depending on age,
qualifications and
experience. And there is
plenty of room for career
development.
