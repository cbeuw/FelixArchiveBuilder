Boat C l u b boat issue.
First off were the apologies, never have
they been so closely scrutinised, the "who
was repping for w h o issue" being thrown
in with the " a r e they eligible to?".
Matters arising arose and straight away
the agenda was tampered with to bring all
matters pertaining boats together. T h e
motion disallowing any lending of boats to

case a n d T Hillyer (Rep for J Passmore)

taken o n the motion, which was carried.

hour many of the representatives then

to use the on-off switch. However, despite
a spirited attempt to vote I C Radio out of
