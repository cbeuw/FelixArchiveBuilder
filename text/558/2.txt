Dear Colin
Inspired by the pool of intelligence
that wrote last week's letter on the
a) hardness of concrete
b) virtues of grass
c) disgusting inaccuracies
flaunted by Mr O'Boyle.
I have decided to add my piece
to the ever increasing anti-concrete/
pro-grass/Beit Quad-sectors plea.
Firstly, I am aware that the first
aim of the designers was not that
of beauty to Imperial College
students. No: they had a larger
scale of things in mind. They
thought (honest, they did) only to
make it a lovely sight from the sky.
You know, the beautiful radial
spokes patterned out in stabs and
the intrinsic beauty of the barbeque
pits. I really believe they were
merely thinking of the air passengers
stuck over London with absolutely
nothing to do except stare with
rapture at our newly constructed
marvel.
I feel this well meaning scheme
has been grossly slandered. How
could we fall and break our arms
on grass? As Messrs Attenborough,
Bellamy, Attenborough and Evans
stated grass has soothing properties.
However the wisdom of the design
is obvious — who likes being
soothed? Everyone likes to wake
up in the morning, jump out of
bed, breath in fresh air and get
threatened by a concrete slab.
Golly, whoppee, gosh, goodness
is it not wonderful to know that all
the decisions made here have been
based totally on concern for the
citizens of College, nay, not
College, for England, nay not
England but the world!!!
Yours with a sincere feeling of
safety in the hands of such decisions,
Perry, I even sing about it, Como
Kevin, I always play on it, Keegan

Dear Sir
With reference to the letter on
security which appeared in FELIX,
may I throw more light on the
subject of which Messrs Clark and
Stevens should make themselves
aware.
Back doors in many cases are
left open by students and staff who
are too idle to use main entrances
after the said doors are locked. At
Physics, it is usually people from
Huxley who come to the main
entrance to gain easy access to Beit
Hall, and once opened these doors
must be locked again by key and
bearing in mind the fact that only
one security guard operates at
weekends, the building could, and
is sometimes, open for an hour or
so at a time whilst the guard is
doing his rounds. Situations like
this occur in most buildings, and yet
the College will be cutting the
numbers of guards and messengers.
I would now like to talk about
Southside security having three
years experience in that department
on night security.
Who breaks the glass in doors
and windows to allow access to the
intruder? Usually drunken students.
I cannot count the number of
times the glass in the entrance
doors to Keogh Hall have been
smashed during the night.
The entrance door to Stan's Bar
(which I think should be done away
with) is often latched back by
students on leaving, after it has
been secured. I once put it to Mr
Mellows and the late Mr Dawson
that instead of students having
access keys to Keogh-Selkirk and
Falmouth-Tizard entrances every-
body at night uses the main entrance
and if necessary have their passes
checked. (This would possibly have
eliminated the rape, and would
certainly help to keep out intruders.)
It would also prevent students from
wedging the doors open to allow late
friends to gain entry to parties, etc
and sleeping in the baths.
I have on numerous occasions
found it necessary to evict people
(strangers) from the Union Room
above the Radio Room after they
have been given a key to sleep
rough. After lour years on night
security I would say that most of the
non-security is caused by lack of
cooperation from students and staff,
and a severe lack of manpower.
Yours

Generally, a good day was
had by all who competed and
finally, congratulations must go

PINBALL — Past Feelings on this
'sex machine'
This letter was first printed in FEUX on 28th
February 1975.
Dear Sir
During the one and a half years that I have
been at this college I have noted with interest
the strange and ostensibly emotional involve-
ment many male students have with Mr
Gottleib's game of pinball. I would like
therefore with your leave, to examine this
phenomenon using the much ridiculed and
maligned, though basically correct, techniques
and theories of psycho-analysis developed by
Jung, Freud and the more obscure T Endur.
It does not require very deep analysis to
expose the motivation of this 'game'. The
pinball machine is merely an extension of the
phallus, whilst the operation of the flippers
(nipples?) with passionately convulsive pelvic
thrusts is a sub-conscious sexual intercourse.
Attaining an orgasm is thinly disguised as the
'replay'; the 'tilt' when exuberant thrusting has
affected the machine is the selfish premature
ejaculation due to insufficient selfcontrol. The
cacophanous bells and buzzers and flashing
lights of the submissive; reclining machine all
serve to hold reserved for the beauty of the
female body. Pinball has become a primitive
sex substitute. How often do you see women
'playing the silver ball' and have your readers
never been struck by the incongruity of this
sight?
I think that my observations will make clear
to many of your more sensitive readers the truly
primitive nature of the lusts and desires of
many students at our illustrious college. The
promulgation of the image of the Imperial
student as a beer drinking, pinball playing,
super virile male and the competition between
rival factions within the college for supremacy I
find pitifull and nauseous. I hope that my
analysis, the truth of which cannot be doubted,
will serve to lead those who are penitent
towards the path of truth, beauty and virtue.
Floreat Collegium!

Through the ages, the ancient game has
