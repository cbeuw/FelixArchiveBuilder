IN MEMORIUM
A y e a r of w r i t i n g illegible a r t i c l e s for
Broadsheet f o l l o w e d b y t h i s y e a r of
F E L I X hacking has left me, finally lost for
words.
But deep down I k n o w that this is my
last opportunity to wax eloquently ( o r ;
otherwise) to an assembled mass of 2—
4000 persons, depending on how many
F E L I X e s get collated.
In the past I have tried smart-assed
writing, I've tried cynicism and I've tried
downright nastiness. Well don't expect
me to change my style nowl
The problem of how to write one's o w n
obituary has, however, disturbed me. I
p i c k e d u p the " G u i d e T o F a d i n g Into
O b s c u r i t y " by J M B e r r y a n d f l i c k e d
through the opening paragraphs: " R e c r i m -
inations", " H u m b l e T h a n k s " and " G r a c e -
less C o m m e n t s " , but to be frightfully
honest it wasn't helpful.
Four years have now passed since I
arrived on the IC scene and now lie like
so many calendar pages in the dustbin of
my mind. B u t what else is in the trash
can.
I r u m m a g e . W h a t d o I f i n d ? T o r n
e l e c t i o n p o s t e r s f r o m t w o d i f f e r e n t
c a m p a i g n s , a p u n c t u r e d r u g b y ball (a
symbol of my athletic career) and about
100 old dinner menus. C a n that be all
that remains of this exciting and formative
period? O f course not. F u r t h e r delving
being careful not to cut myself on the
empty S w a n cans, and in amongst the
half-eaten curries my 'Salad Days' unfold.
I remember that T e n T o r s trip in my
first year which taught me so m u c h . I
recall how in one weekend I learned that
the s e c r e t of a c h i e v e m e n t lies i n the
desire to achieve and the belief that one
will. W a s it this quickly emerging super-
confidence that persuaded an u n k n o w n
rugby player to become President? W h o
really cares?
Digging and stirring in the bin I've now
found countless fragments of memorabilia
evidence of dozens of events all important
in their o w n way and welling inside me I
feel almost nostalgic.
Almost is however the operative word,
four years is a long time and it is time I
left, a postgraduate prevarication would
be unhealthy (and out of the question), so
I'm looking forward to setting foot into the
outside world!
' R e v i e w s of the Y e a r ' , v e r d i c t s a n d
comparisons really serve no purpose as
p a t e n t l y , m a n k i n d n e v e r l e a r n s by its
mistakes even if it manages to identify
them. A n y w a y I've written two already.
I will say though, that I have enjoyed
the challenge of this job and that I nearly
enjoyed the job itself. A brief plummet
into statistics reveals the following:
Estimated Breakdown Of The
Work Of Fox:
Telephone calls answered — 40000
Letters written — 2100
Meetings attended — 750
Pints drunk — 2800
Dinners attended — 37
Campaigns organised — w h o me?
C u p s of coffee drunk — 500
Bullshit shifted — 25.37 tonnes
"Hello: 3915"
"Can I speak to the President please?"
"Hi there; Chris Fox speaking"
"Oh! I wanted John Passmore"
"OVER A N D OUT"
"The King is dead; Thank God!"

If you sell someone a weapon,}
knowing that it will be used to
kill an innocent person, do you
share in the quilt of killing?
Apart from the sale of weapons
for n a t i o n a l d e f e n c e , B r i t i s h
firms conduct a large export
trade in guns and other equip-
ment such as radios, television
cameras and computers which
they k n o w will be used for the
suppression of internal dissent.
The Pye radios found among
the bodies at Idi A m i n ' s 'State
R e s e a r c h C e n t r e ' i n U g a n d a
are an example.
A m n e s t y International, which
exists to protect people from
persecution for their opinions,
is conducting a campaign on
repressive technology. In J a n -
uary the chairman of its British
Section asked M r s Thatcher to
widen export controls, which at
present apply only to weapons
in the narrow sense and even
then not if they are sold to the

saying that such action would
" h a v e significant implications
for our trade and our relations
with other countries". C o n c e r n
about the morality of British
profits from this trade prompted
a p a r l i a m e n t a r y r e q u e s t to
L o r d S t r a t h c o n a , a D e f e n c e
Minister of State, to name the

O n 23rd J u n e the Director of

to Francis P y m , Secretary of
the Ministry of Defence, to name
the countries, in order to allay
p u b l i c s u s p i c i o n that we are
.selling arms to regimes which
torture and murder their citizens.
