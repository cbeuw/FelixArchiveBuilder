What was that about
four new halls
of Residence?
by Derek E. Cummings
Yes, it was a long time ago.
It was last year, just before Christmas, when I wrote
an article suggesting how Imperial College could get
itself four new Halls of Residence and thereby ease
its accommodation problem.
I suggested, you may remember, that there was land
available held by the Greater L o n d o n Council, and
that there was money available held by the banks. A n d
that what was needed was a concerted effort by a l l
concerned to bring the two together. I make no excuses
for bringing the subject u p again. A s a matter of fact,
I a m delivering a General Studies lecture on precisely
that, next Tuesday, February 20. I would like y o u to
come and hear me, because I a m interested i n the
reactions of everyone involved.
A n d , surely, you are involved?
BEEHIVES?
One student who thought he was involved was John
Porter. H e wrote a letter to the editor of Felix and it
was published i n the January 8 issue.
I'd like to commend John Porter for his interest. H e
wasn't entirely i n agreement with what I had written
but his letter did raise a number of points which I
would like to take up.
In the first place, he questioned whether students
really need to be housed in little cubes stacked on top
of one another and suggested that what they really
need is a home instead of a unit of accommodation.
Well, that's a humanitarian view, I agree. B y impli-
cation it makes a hall of residence sound like a latter-
day workhouse. B u t apart from the fact that almost
any living space can be defined i n terms of cubes—
simply because we live i n a three-dimensional w o r l d —
I simply do not agree that a hall of residence has to
be no more than a series of cells. What I do say is that
vertical building is economic and that if there is not
the cash about to provide every student with a country
cottage, the idea of a well designed apartment block is
the best compromise.
A n d i n any case, isn't a hall of residence, properly
designed with facilities the student needs — such as
shops, a hank, a launderette, and, of course, a good bar
—isn't that preferable to some of the over-priced, under-
sized private flats that many students live i n now?
John Porter also draws the parallel with Surrey U n i -
versity at Guildford, and the kind of village community
they have built there.
It so happens that I live near Guildford and I have
visited the campus at Surrey many times, and I have
talked to just as many students there who dislike the
design of their accommodation as do like it.
I suppose it goes to prove that you can't please a l l
the people a l l the time and that perhaps there is no
perfect answer to the problem. I don't for a moment
hold my project to be the perfect solution. What I do
say about it is that it is the most obvious one.
A n d there is really very little point i n engaging i n
that kind of polemic just now. There are four thousand
students at I.C. and I have no doubt that every one
of them could put forward a blueprint for the ideal
type of accommodation and every one would be
different.
Derek E. Curnmsngs' lecture next
Tuesday will be of importance to us
all — and certainly should be of inter-
est. Whether or not you agree with
his solution to the accommodation
problem, he's prepared to stand up
and say it again. It's YOUR opportunity
to get into the argument and perhaps
to make a point. After alt, this is our
concern. Even if you are among those
who think that halls of residence can
be built by willpower alone, or believe
that the accommodation problem can
be solved by waving a wand, come to
the General Studies lecture and say so.
What is really important is the need for some kind
of accommodation and the will to find an answer to
that need.

A l l right, it is going to cost money. There simply are
not enough Wolfsons and Gulbenkians around to grant
all the cash necessary, even if there is the inclination.
A n d if we a l l sat back and waited for some govern-
ment to answer all the problems, 1 should think we'll
be sitting in the cold for a long time to come. A n d this
is where wc come to the crux of John Porter's letter. H e
is fairly scathing about the plan I put forward to bor-
row the money from the banks and couples his argu-
ment with some mathematics to demonstrate how ex-
pensive it is all going to be.
Well now, there are a couple of points I'd like to
make i n reply. First, the bank is where the money is.
If there is going to be any accommodation at all, the
plan will have to be submitted to whoever has the
money to translate it into bricks and mortar. A n d at
the moment, that looks like the bank. O f course, if
the majority of you feel that borrowing money from
the bank is contrary to your principles, I'll forget the
whole thing. Assuming, of course, that no-one has a
bank overdraft or is buying anything on hire purchase
. . . Second, it was a bit tough of John Porter to hit me
with figures. After a l l , we are really talking about
possibilities — practical ones, nonetheless — and I a m
not prepared to argue pounds and pence until.we have
something more concrete to discuss.
IT CAN BE DONE!
Y o u see, what I a m driving at is this. The project
1 have i n mind is a likely answer to the student accom-
modation dilemma. I a m quite willing to stick my neck
out and go and ask for the land and the money and
all the rest, but what I have to know is that you are
behind the idea, as an idea. I could fill the whole of
Felix and talk a l l next Tuesday about it, but it isn't
worth a damn unless y o u give it your support.
But before I have the last word, I'd like to take up
the final point i n John Porter's letter. He mentions a
successful rent strike at Sussex, which resulted in the
authorities there scrapping a project to build halls of
residence and in their place, agreeing to some other
form of housing.
Surely the point here is that the university was ready
to start building—something. Whether it was a tower
block or a mineshaft makes little difference to our
theme. The money was there: the argument was about
how it should be spent.
W e are i n a wholly different ball game. The problem
with I.C. is to find the money and to find the land. I
only suggest that we a l l put our minds to that problem
first and argue about exactly what to make of them
afterwards.
I pointed out i n my original article that 1 v/ould be
perfectly prepared to assist any group which feels
strongly enough about this thing to try for a solution.
That offer still stands and I shall repeat it at m y
General Studies lecture next week.
I also said that nothing at all would happen unless
you, the students, wanted it to happen and got up off
your seats and made it happen.
That remains true, and I shall repeat that at my lec-
ture, too. Which is why I commend John Porter. H e
didn't go along with the views I'd expressed, and he
said so and he said why.
A n d if John Porter represents the majority feeling
among y o u all, well, there's nothing much for me to
do but drop the whole idea. B u t before I did that, I'd
want to make quite sure that you a l l knew what I have
been talking about.
I have been — I a m — talking about an opportunity
to create four new halls of residence for Imperial C o l -
lege. I'm talking about getting the land and getting
the money. I'm talking about a chance y o u have to
create something for yourselves and for future students.
F i n talking about you.
A n d — forgive me if I'm wrong — I don't think I've
heard too much of that kind of talk recently.
