AN INTELLECTUAL WEEKEND
F o u r times a year, the weekend solitude of Silwood
Park field station is upset by the arrival of a coachload
of pseudo-intellectuals under the T O U C H S T O N E ban-
ner. Occasionally F E L I X manages to infiltrate a
pseudo-reporter into this exclusive group. O u r chance
this year came with Lawrence Burton who spoke o n
"Democracy versus the Expert".
H I S T O R Y (frequently) self-appointed

light of day when Sir R o d - w h e n N e w t o n first s t i f l e d
eric H i l l (rector of the
50's) made the initial
moves i n I C towards Gen-
eral Studies. Its format,
like college attitudes to
G e n e r a l Studies, has
changed very little since.
This is not intended as cri-
ticism (of Touchstone)
though which has ac-
quired a character and tra-
dition belying its compar-
atively short existence.
F O R M
F o r the multitudes w h o
have never enjoyed the re-
laxing atmosphere of a
Touchstone w e e k e n d
(would y o u believe even
more people go through
college without a Touch-
stone than a l l those w h o
never go to U n i o n meet-
ings?) a quick review of
form shouldn't go amiss.
The weekend starts outside
the U n i o n A r c h at 1415
hrs Saturday when the
coach arrives to take us
away (ha, ha). Upon arri-
val at Silwood we start
eating, and eating, and eat-
ing, and . . . (more resem-
blance to a Gourmet's
Gobble than a n intellect-
ual weekend). Interspersed
between meals come a talk
by the speaker, discussion
groups, a walk i n the park
(or read of Sunday news-
papers depending o n wea-
ther) and a review of the
discussion topic by the
speaker. A t 1600 hrs Sun-
day the coach returns to
the hallowed precincts of
I C proper. Since, owing to
college subsidies, y o u get
all this for only £1.00,
everybody (even you, m y
boy) can afford to go —
your esteemed reporter
wholeheartedly recom-
mends it.
T E C H N O L O G Y v.
T H E I N D I V I D U A L
So to the subject of last
w e e k e n d ' s discussion,
Democracy versus the E x -
pert". General consensus
was quick to agree that the
topic had the makings of
a " g o o d " Touchstone
(don't forget, they know
. . . they've practically a l l
been before!) being almost
infectious i n its appeal.
A s technology advances
we become increasingly
unable to counter the
views a n d agreements
placed before us b y o u r
general discussion of the
concepts of mechanics (by
his new, mathematical, ap-
proach) experts have been
endeavouring to elevate
their status above the
coffee-room proletariat.
D o you know more about
Concorde than the brains
of B A C ?
A C H A N C E ?
Fortunately there has
been a concurrent increase
in media-coverage which
attempts to provide basic
facts (e.g. Piccadilly). This
is a necessary prerequisite
for general consumer par-
ticipation, which should
undoubtedly follow. There
are exceptions to be noted
here though when (e.g.
shoes, cars) it is question-
able whether the consumer
actually gets what he
wants; or what advertise-
ments tell him he wants—
remembering that experts
have ideals (special shoes,
safety cars) which far from
being attained, aren't even
being moved towards.
K I D S
Touchstone discussion
groups follow general
question time guides. T h e
speaker questioned " W h o
decides h o w to bring u p
children—parents o r child-
psychologists?" similarly
" W h o runs schools a n d
colleges?" It was agreed
that within limits demo-
cracy m a y be intended
within a university but
within the wider constrat-
ings of society pressures
are brought to bear over-
ruling the wishes of those
most immediately con-
cerned.
P A D S ?
Term-planning was con-
sidered too. In the ques-
tion of the "Englishman's
Castle" how c a n conflict-
ing opinions a l l be taken
into account. H o w many
new towns are aesthetic-
ally appealing to the pass-
ing visitor and yet unsuited
to the permanent inhabi-
tant?
So to the question of
transferrable expertise. It
is incredible how many
experts in one field (one of
your department's profs?)
are consulted, i n an expert
capacity, i n totally unre-
lated fields. Perhaps, bluff
and deception play a large
part with such people.
Ponder for a while, when
you hear a n "expert" —
are you the right kind of
expert to be quoted on this
subject?
Y O U
This article is N O T i n -
tended to review personal
opinions expressed during
one weekend at Silwood
Park. I have endeavoured
to prompt Y O U the reader
to think, so try these guide-
lines :
T h i n k about the Touch-
stone questions n o t e d
above
and think about coming to
a Touchstone weekend i n
the future
and G o along to listen to
Lawrence Burton when
you next have the oppor-
tunity.
Finally I, the F E L I X
reporter, would like to
t h a n k M r . M c D o w a l l ,
General Studies, for hav-
ing me along, a n d M C B
for giving m e a lift (with
seven other passengers) i n
the Jowitt - christened
Kosher Kit-e-Kat Carrier
Express.

CEFE on the grants campaign
We demand a living grant
— e n d the means test now
We want more money —
starving isn't funny
£100 now
These were some of the
slogans of the demonstra-
tion last Wednesday; the
first action of the grants
campaign m I C . F o r the
first time I C students
turned words into deeds
and came out on the street
demanding higher grants.
But demonstrations alone
achieve little. They cer-
tainly don't force the gov-
ernment to do anything
and the publicity value is
minimal. W e have already
shown by voting i n favour
of refectory boycotts that
we know it is only by put-
ting pressure o n the col-
lege authorities and thus
the government that we
can win our demands.
The refectory boycotts
are a start to effective
action. T h e college auth-
orities are already very
worried about the conse-
quences and Mooney is
attempting to get a 25 per
cent increase in prices. W e
must be aware of this and
be prepared to take action
against any such price
rises. B y boycotting the
refectories we are hitting
the college authorities at
their weakest point, since
the refectories have to be
self financing; our actions
thus have the greatest
effect. This is therefore a
tactically correct w a y to
begin our campaign. Those
who came o n the demon-
stration must now work to
explain to the rest of the
students w h y we are boy-
cotting the refectories, and
get them to see the need
for such action, thus build-
ing up support and getting
more students involved.
F o r we can only continue
our campaign if we have
greater awareness among
the rest of the students.
F r o m refectory boycotts
we can go o n to lecture
b o y c o t t s , occupations,
short-duration strikes, etc.,
which disrupt the running
of college and thus also put
pressure on the authorities.
These actions would i n -
volve a l l the students;
therefore those students
who were n o t o n the de-
monstration and never go
to union meetings must
also become convinced of
the need for action. T h e
grants campaign must be
extended. T h e harder we
fight the greater will be our
success.
A s regards students as
a whole the present action
in which we are engaged
is a very significant step
forward. Students are now
involved with issues which
directly affect us and, hav-
ing been forced into action
by necessity, are learning!
that we have the strength!
to w i n our demands pro-!
vided we take effective
action. In this we are i n
the same situation as the
rest of the working class;
however, we are only now
beginning to realise what
other workers have real-
ized a l l along: that it is
only through struggle that
we can defend out inter-
ests.
The fight for a decent
standard of living will not
end with the present cam-
paign. Even £100 hardly
brings us back to the 1962
level let alone gives us any
real increase. A s long as
prices continue to rise
there will always be the
need to fight for higher
grants. T h e strength and
experience gained i n this
campaign will serve us i n
the future.
I C U Elections
Nominations a r e n o w
open for the main posts
of the union including the
sabbatical posts. T h e
strength of the union o f
course depends on the
awareness a n d involve-
ment of the members but
good strong leadership is
essential. T h e grants cam-
paign throughout t h e
country has shown that
we need a union prepared
to take action to defend
the interests of its mem-
bers. T h e President of the
union must be actively in-
volved i n leading the
union to fight against a l l
attacks o n students and
get a l l students involved
in action. W e call on a l l
students to vote for the
candidate who has demon-
strated these qualities.
