Letter
Sice one,
Cyril!
Sir,
There now follows the text
of a Very Exclusive Inter-
view Indeed with Myself.
You state that 'Felix will
continue to attempt to show
all sides of the argument'
(note to letter, page 2, col 1,
Felix No. 327). I beg to
differ. Felix has not yet
shown all sides of the argu-
ment.
Letters explaining some
socialist viewpoints have
been forthcoming, even if
they appeared with the usual
sectarian signatures [ s e e the
Communist Party of Britain
(Marxist - Leninist) v. the
Communist Party of Great
Britain (Stalinist*) in "Exter-
nal Affairs' 'at the Neasden
Hippodrome}. Where are the
explanations of dynamic Con-
servatism (almost as much of
an oxymoron as "Young Con-
servative")? I find a neutered
Catnip column, and letters
disagreeing with the CPBM-L
militant here in earth. Where
are the articles which sug-
gest that banks should build
halls of residence a n d point
out that they might well be
financed in part by the mas-
sive repayments on private
loans — loans such as young
couples must take out to start
a home at the price levels of
a free, competitive market?
Felix shows both sides of the
argument?
I suspect, Mr. Dowson,
that you could write an ex-
cellent article extolling the
virtues of Conservatism /cap-
italism and free enterprise,
including the usual references
to late delivery which seem
to be a plague of the British
Print Industry (and don't say
that strikes are the cause!).
When will it appear? Why
must we be content with
ludicrous editorials telling us
we are middle class and
should therefore choose
to remain politically impot-
ent? Why is a member of an
opposing faction ridiculed,
and then his suggestion that
Felix should be partisan
called "sheer hypocrisy"?
Some may say it already is.
I believe, Mr. Dowson, that
although Felix has improved
in some ways, you are still
trying it on. "Don't take a
letter to the DES" indeed.
You know very well it is too
late to unseat you from your
sabbatical without conclus-
ively writing off Felix for this
year at least. I say no more.
Yours,
ROB ARMITAGE and
SIMON ALLNUTT

More on
Felix's
Politics
Sir,
Mr. Gillett's letter last week
was not, as you claimed, ad-
vocating the suppression of
free speech. Surely quite the
opposite, in that Felix, as a
student newspaper, should
discuss all the issues in-
volved which affect stud-
ents; in particular the grants
campaign and the defence of
student rights. You, like so
many other great advocates
of free speech, felt the need
to bend over backwards to
give extra coverage to a non-
student (Mr. Mooney) in an
article attacking our grants
campaign. You gave that
article front page coverage
and did not even bother to
obtain any comments from
the NUPE shop stewards who
are in a better position to
know what their membership
feels than their "boss" Mr.
Mooney.
Those people who cry
loudest about free speech are
amongst the first to justify
the need for censorship. Over
the suppression of Granada's
'World in Action' programme
on the Poulson Affair, not one
newspaper's editorial (those
great bastions of free speech)
spoke out against this blat-
ant censorship.

French
Letter to
Editor
Sir,
In replying to Adolf von
Weaselgrope, could I quote
from F. Temple Kingson's
book "French Existentialism
— a Christian critique'.
'The non-Christian existen-
tialists make a distinction be-
tween the c o g i t o pre-reflexive
and the c o g i t o reflective. It is
upon the ambiguity based on
this distinction that their two
methods of communication
are founded. For the non-
Christian existentialists, the
pre-reflective c o g i t o concerns
an immediate awareness in
sense, experience, emotion
and action that precedes any
objectifying by the mind'.
I remain yours essentially,

Encore
Sonia
Sir,
Referring to Chris Stevens'
letter, he seems to think that
pure research is totally use-
less, i.e. is unprofitable.
Surely he must realise that
research is a long term in-
vestment. Some of the re-
search may turn out to be
useless, other research pro-
duces results which are very
profitable. Unfortunately for
the bourgeoisie they cannot
predict the results in ad-
vance. There does take place
some research "for the sake
of it" but somebody has to
pay for this — either the gov-
ernment or industry — nei-
ther of whom are prone to
paying out money without
seeing a return. It is very
difficult to get government
grants for research without
giivng good justification for
it. So regrettably the profit
motive extends even here. It
is only when the profit motive
has been totally abolished
that research too will serve
the people.
As for the bourgeoisie not
taking action to make the
most from education — that
is exactly what they are
doing—by providing educa-
tion.
Yours sincerely,
SONIA HO CHFELDER
A Plea
Sir,
We feel there is a certain
lack of clarity in some of the
ideas put forward in the
grants campaign. Therefore
to help build an effective
campaign we issued the en-
closed leaflet on the grants
demo, where it was favour-
ably received — so far as
we could assess. Will you
please therefore print it in
Felix.
Yours in Springtime hope,
PIERS CORBYN

Solidarity
Challenge
Sir.
A student-worker relation-
ship to fight the freeze gain
higher grants for students:
these slogans begin to look
sick when letters attacking
defenceless workers are al-
lowed to be printed in FELIX.
I am not in fact saying that
Felix should censor all let-
ters, but that the students
and Lane in particular should
come to the defence of these
workers. CEFE is the only
publication which does this
in fact, and I firmly believe
that the article proving that
the Hall cleaners' wages
were not the reason why the
Hall fees were so high com-
pelled the management to is-
sue a denial of possible cut-
backs in hall cleaning staff.
Come on, John, stop sitting
on the fence; if you really
want a good student-worker
relationship in IC then prove
it in next week's FELIX.
RON PARKER
(Nupe)
Even
more
boring
Sir,
I was most distressed to
see that your correspondent
Mr. Ulyanov ('Letters', Feb-
ruary 6th, 1973) suffers from
that extremely discomforting
disease ' tautophony'. It
caused me such sorrow to
see a brother in this piteous
state that I would humbly,
through the accommodating
medium of your esteemed
columns, proffer treatment
for his relief.
Dear, dear Comrade
Camp-balls, there is an anci-
ent proverb (formulated
when all our ancestors were
revelling in the delights of
total social freedom) stating
that "empty vessels make the
most sound". Perhaps, as a
dialectically thinking scient-
ist (or have you recanted?)
you would agree with the
advice that, if you stopped
spouting, in a short while
enough spunk would have
accumulated for you to per-
form the actions and not just
the motions.
If this fails — God forbid
— then may I suggest that
you adopt the prescription of
Aaetius, of a firm cucumber
applied internally.
Yours in Hippocrates,
H. el EBORE
Adolf's
Answer
Sir,
My letter two weeks ago
stimulated a response which
I thoroughly anticipated, and
which I have no intention of
ignoring.
It was rather fun to see
Mr. R. "Gosh, haven't I got
a lovely beard, lads," Apple-
by continuously contradicting
himself in a whole column
of "pointless derogatory
and back-biting remarks",
written apparently against
his will. Poor chap — one
could almost detect the wal-
rus tear-stains on the paper.
One would hope (though in
vain, I fear), that any future
articles from Broadsheet,
whose only correspondent
appears to be its editor, will
discuss subjects of greater
interest.
Incidentally, as a reader of
of Guildsheet, Mr. Appleby
should be well acquainted
with my nom-de-plume.
While being factually more
correct than his article, my
letter was not, as he pointed
out, written in the most
serious of veins, and I saw
no reason to make an ex-
ception with the signature.
Suffice it to say that I am
familiar enough with Mr.
Appleby to put my views to
him personally if I so wished
(or to put cyanide in his
beer). Isn't it nice to know
who your friends are?
Yours amicably,
ADOLF VON
WEASELGROPE,
President,
C. & G. Ron Bashing
Society.
