Deliverance (X) J o n Voigt, Burt
R e y n o l d s .
A very grisly tale i n d e e d about
w h a t g o e s w r o n g w h e n four b u s i n e s s -
m e n go for a canoe-trip d o w n the
r a p i d s in G e o r g i a . A very m i x e d film
— v e r y heavy in p l a c e s but generally
very e x c i t i n g . S t r o n g acting through-
out.
The Ruling Class (X) Peter 0 T o o l e ,
A l a s t a i r S i m , A r t h u r L o w e .
The best film I've seen this year.
Peter O T o o l e is the lunatic 14th Earl
of G u r n e y w i t h a J e s u s fixat'on
f o r c e d to take over the f a m i l y seat
w h e n his father a c c i d e n t a l l y hangs
h i m s e l f w h i l e i n d u l g i n g in his private
p e r v e r s i o n . T h i s film m a i n l y takes a
d i g at P u b l i c S c h o o l s , the U p p e r
C l a s s e s a n d the M o n a r c h y but is very
funny as w e l l . A trifle long, but w e l l
w o r t h sitting through.
Fritz the Cat (X) C a r t o o n
H a r d to f o l l o w in p l a c e s , unless
y o u ' r e w e l l up in A m e r i c a n S l a n g .
B a s i c a l l y s a t i r i c a l , but generally
funny if you like ultra-obscene car-
toons. Not to be m i s s e d , just for the
experience.
The Godfather (X) M a r l o n B r a n d o
a n d a cast of t h o u s a n d s .
Not by any m e a n s as g o o d as the
b o o k — a highly c o m p r e s s e d v e r s i o n .
I d i d n ' t think m u c h of the a c t i n g , ex-
cept M a r l o n B r a n d o , w h o is incoher-
ent a n y w a y . The v i o l e n c e is very w e l l
staged i n d e e d , t h o u g h .
The Getaway (X) A l i M a c G r a w , S t e v e
M c Q u e e n .
Sheer e s c a p i s m (pun). C o p s a n d
Robbers reversed (Steve M c Q u e e n ' s

W H A T THE HELL IS PHOENIX
Does a iyone know what the mysterious Phoeno-
menon of Phoenix is? It has been tacked up on various
notice-boards around college with its diphthong mis-
sing and not even Nobody has noticed. Does this
mean that the propagation of knowledge about Phoe.iix
is drawing to a halt, and that soon it may be extinct?
Will its clos ig date for contributions pass without
so much as a murmur, let alone an article?
Yes, it does unless people send in artwork (black
and white only) and photos and poems and prose and
essays etc. Phoenix is the literary counterpart of
Felix. It comes out once a vear and its aim is to pro-
vide a bit of culture for you poor starved dull and
over-disciplined scientists. But it is also provided BY
you. So don't be shy. Even if you have only written
one poem in your life, send it in and let us see. The
magazine can only be of good quality if we have a
wide selection to choose from. Thanks.

WHY YOU MUST SUPPORT THE GRANTS DEMO S t i r l i n g
There will be a G R A N T S n F . M n O N P F n u r i A R v i .
There will be a G R A N T S D E M O O N F E B R L A R \
21st by a l l the colleges and universities i n the southern
region. We have to give massive support to this demo
as it is of crucial importance to all students.
T h e objectives of the N U S who have called it are
threefold:—
(i) A n immediate payment to all students over and
above their present grant and to be tied to inflation
through annual reviews of the cost of living for all
students.
(ii) The abolition of the means test and discretion-
ary awards system so that all students be given the
m a x i m u m grant.
(iii) T h e tallying of the notional element in grants
for accommodation to the actual cost of H a l l fees (in-
cluding meals).
Briefly sketched, their reasons are that this year we
were given an increase of 3 % p.a.. but the present
industrial rate of inflation is 8 % p.a. and the rate of
inflation of those things that students spend most o n —
food, rent, clothes and books—is now 1 5 % and in-
creasing. Parents are finding it increasingly difficult to
pay the parental contribution owing to inflation strik-
ing at their standards of living, so it is important to
ensure that all students receive the same grant and
this can be done by abolishing the means test. A n y
woman student who wants to get married is having to
seriously consider her post-marital financial situation,
undoubtedly she would find a vast cut in her grant as
the m a x i m u m discretionary award she could get is
£275 p.a. Moreover this amount is assessable on her
husband's income and could therefore be even less
than the present paltry m a x i m u m allowance she would
be given. In many areas hall fees greatly exceed the
notional element in the grant—this is very true at I.C.
if one were to eat all one's meals at Mooney, despite
the seemingly small hall fees.
O u r grants are decreasing in value, our standard of
living is falling—this is a situation which demands
action by all students now!
What kind of action can we take? The N U S advo-
cates nationwide rent strikes, refectory boycotts, peti-
tions, demonstrations and any show of student solidarity
over this issue.
In order to understand why this form of economic
and political action is necessary rather than sending
letters to M P s , or relying on the Committee for Vice
Chancellors and Principals ( C V C P ) to simply show
the worthiness of our case to the government, we have
to analyse why the present situation has occurred, and
what has prompted the N U S to take such measures.
A n y such analysis must be incomplete unless it looks
at all of the present worldwide political and economic
spectrum.
I he grants debate must be set in the context of the
present international crisis of capital. International
capitalism entered an inflationary boom cycle in 1^45
with the intention of pacifying the dangerously militant
working class of Europe. In so doing it evaded one
crisis but paved the way for a yet more extensive and
damaging one in the future, and this is the situation in
which we find ourselves now.
The present crisis is a crisis of value, in which the
value of currency is in continuous decline, while the
value of labour, reflected in an until recently increased
standard of living of the working class, is higher than
ever before. It is essential for capitalism in each
country to inject greater value into its currency at the
expense of foreign capitalism. T o do this it must first
cut the value of labour on its home free market.
T h e value of labour is determined in the same way as
the value of any other commodity, in terms of the
labour required for its production. The cost of labour
is defined explicitly in " W a g e Labour and C a p i t a l " as
"the cost required for maintaining the worker as a
worker and of developing him into a worker." to which
M a r x later adds the cost of replacing old labour power
with new, i.e. the cost of maintenance of dependents.
The cost of maintaining a worker is a minimum if
the worker is living at subsistence level, and any in-
crease in standard of living above this level implies an
increase in the value, and hence cost, of that worker's
labour (strictly, labour power). Thus any attempt to
lower the cost of labour must involve an attack on
the standard of living of workers. It is in this light
that we must approach issues such as the increasing
of indirect taxation relative to direct taxation and the
general shift from taxing luxuries to taxing essentials;
the " F a i r " Rents Act, the introduction of V A T and the
"wage freeze" and other aspects of Phase II. This last,
along with entry to the E E C which will facilitate move-
ment of capital from Britain to low-cost labour areas
of the community and associate nations, and the In-
dustrial Relations Act, constitute an attempt to emas-
culate the working class and prevent defence against
attacks on standards of living.
These arguments cannot be appreciated however if
universities are still viewed as training grounds for the
ruling class. In fact, this viewpoint has been shown to
be untenable by the upsurge in the last twenty years
in vocation-based courses, the increase in involvemen
on the part of industry in academic courses and the
Rothschild report on research and the role of the Poly-
technic. Perhaps nowhere can this be seen more clearly
than at IC where the courses are obviously simply
training grounds for industry. Students at IC can have
no false notions about being fledgling bourgeois—their
future is to be the highly skilled proletarians that are
required by our extremely advanced technological
society.
Thus students are as much proletarians as any man-
ual worker. However the training required is such that
their development into workers is a far more protracted
process. Furthermore, the value of their labour power
when it is finally produced is very high due to the high
cost of developing such workers. So it comes as no
surprise that grant levels have fallen steadily since
1962: that the Retail Price Index went up 6 % in the
first half of last year while grants increased only 3 ^ % :
that "rationalisation" is the word of the day through-
out further education, and there is talk of reducing
some three year courses to two years. A l l this is simply
a direct result of the international recession in cap
italism.
Seen in this way it is clear that letters to M P s arc
utterly without effect. There is a lot to be gained how-
ever by working with the C V C P as long as their m.itives
are clearly understood. Each Vice Chancellor and
Principal is solely concerned with keeping the peace
on their individual campusses, because it is only in
such an atmosphere that the colleges and universitic
can fulfil their tasks of training and research. Refec-
tory and lecture boycotts are a method of disrupting
the quiet of college life as well as demonstrating student
solidarity, and on a wide scale can thus spur the C V C P
to take action. But they will try any method short of
supporting our case in order to achieve peace, for
example Sir John Hackett, Principal of King's (Lon-
don), has stated that any rent strike action occurring
at King's will mean higher rents next year—a move
equivalent to blackmail.
Unlike workers whose main economic weapon is to
withhold their labour, the only economic action that
students can take is to not pa\ their hall fees. Unfor-
tunately, owing to the suicidal short-sightedness of
the large right-wing contingent (who will doggedly re-
fuse to admit they are members of the working class
until they are in their first jobs and fighting for their
first paj rise) at the union meeting where a motion
concerning this was raised, IC has voted away its sole
economic weapon in the grants fight.
Miners, gasmen, engineers and civil servants are
arranging to go on strike for the same reasons as are
causing us to fight for a grant increase, and so there
will be every opportunity for an alliance in the future
with those and other sections of the working class as
they begin to feel the attacks of Phase II.
So massive support for the demo on February 21st
is absolutely essential as a way of displaying national
student solidarity over this issue. We mean business,
so let's show it!

O R you can tell E d w a r d
Heath that Queen of yours
to tell Thatcher to lay off
Students.
The University authori-
ties are at the moment still
taking action against stu-
dents who allegedly took
part in demonstrations and
meetings d u r i n g the
Queen's visit. The court
proceedings are being held
in secret, against the
wishes of the accused.
Minutes are, of course,
taken, but the indepen-
dent stenographers were
dismissed after two days,
and the subsequent pro-
ceedings were recorded by
a college employee. When
(after a delay of two
weeks) the minutes were
supplied to the accused,
they discovered that these
minutes were not an ac-
curate record of the pro-
ceedings. There are sev-
eral other facts which
highlight the incompetence
and the unfairness of the
disciplinary system.
1. The defence has been
continuously frustrated in
the over-ruling of quite
proper objections.
2. The disciplinary com-
mittee have continuously
tried to rush through the
proceedings, despite the
fact that this has preju-
diced the defence case.
3. T h e prosecutors
(members of the college
authority) are actually
being called as witnesses.
4. Witnesses cited by the
prosecution cannot be
called by the defence, in
some cases witnesses have
been cited for prosecution
and not been called to
give evidence.
6. The prosecutors refuse
.o comment on or give
reasons for its decisions.
7. The prosecution have
twice had to either radic-
ally change or amend
charges. The Disciplinary
Committee deemed that
all the charges were in-
competent, "this incom-
petency related purely to
questions of procedure'. In
a court of law this would
invalidate all charges.
8. A t one point a pro-
secution witness indicated
the defence lawyer as
being present at the dem-
onstration, he mistook him
for the student he was
supposed to implicate.
9. The court has laid the
burden of proof onto the
accused, to show their
innocence, rather than the
way a court of law sup-
posedly operates.
The prosecuting counsel
admitted in court that
none of the charges would
even be considered rele-
vant in a court of law.
The Charges
Fourteen members of
the student council were
accused with having taken
part in a meeting which
decided to demonstrate on
the day of the Queen's
visit and that they failed
to keep order at the meet-
ing that occurred. The pre-
sident was accused of
playing a prominent part
in the demonstration and
occupation of the library.
Most of the o t h e r
charges related to 'drunk
and disorderly' behaviour.
The Cases So F a r
Five students w e r e
charged with gaining un-
authorised entry to a re-
ception held for the Queen.
F o u r were found guilty.
One female student,
charged with drunk and
disorderly was f o u n d
guilty on the evidence of
a photograph showing her
in a large crowd.
The famous student
photographed d r i n k i n g
from a bottle, was charged
with drinking from a
bottle . . . in the presence
of the Queen. He was
found not guilty, because
the Queen sent a letter say-
ing she did not find his
action discourteous.
The prejudiced nature
of the courts, and the type
of charges, especially the
one which the president of
the students association
was faced with, clearly in-
dicate an attack on the
autonomy of s t u d e n t
affairs, and an attack par-
ticularly on sabbatical offi-
cers; in that the charge
could not be made to stick
on any other students.
IC union policy is to
support any students-
faced with victimisation of
student at Stirling and has
already sent some money
to their defence fund.
Felix will keep you in-
formed of events.
