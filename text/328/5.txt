Superficially, the " p o l i -
tical scene" in Imperial
College U n i o n seems to
comprise 3 groups.
1. "The A p a t h i s t " who
never turns up to
anything.
2. "The wishy-washy
l i b e r a l — c u m — 2 0 per
cent reactionary —
cum —let's-keep-the-
lefties-out.
3. "The L e f t " who may
be regarded as the
prime mover of the
political scene.
However, the classifica-
tion above does not by
any means define the
state of the problems.
" T h e A p a t h i s t " subdi-
vision is not solely com-
prised of the people we
like to think of who are
not aware, cannot be in-
formed and whose only
occupation is the pursuit
of a degree. Included in
the group are the "defeat-
ists" (as John L a n e
would call them) who are
the people who think the
U n i o n can achieve noth-
ing and deliberately opt
out of U G M s . The Union
cannot affect them, they
have no wish to affect the
political activities of the
U n i o n , often their views
are not reflected by the

Me,
A n d my mate Keith.
Someone asked
What is the devil?
And he replied in a
Posh and
Portly voice
That the devil was
Many devils
Some of which may be
Aliens.
From other planets.
He once experienced an
Evil
So terrifying
That it must have been
Supernatural or
Extraterrestial.
But he quickly added that
Most evil is caused by
Us humans.
M y mate Keith thinks that
All evil
Is caused by fat people
Who live in
Palaces and
Mansions and
Who preach at others so that
They do
What the fat people want
Them to do.
He says God is a
Crutch
For people who can't
Come to terms with
Objective reality.
He is very c!ever but has
No soul.
So what ?

Union's General Meet-
ings. The U n i o n is more
of a social organisation,
a facility that helps them
play sport, and continue
other pursuits.
No, the people who
don't turn up aren't a l l
apathists in the true sense
of the word; their decision
is a conscious one.
The second group is
perhaps the most difficult
to define; sometimes it
could be said that they
are the floating voters. The
" L e f t " often label some
of them the obstacles of
democracy when they
challenge the q u o r u m
with only 150 people pre-
sent. They are often the
most patient at U G M s ;
they w i l l wait through the
usually low standard de-
bate to vote with their
conscience on matters
such as V i e t n a m or N o r -
thern Ireland. O n matters
like that, the wishy-washy
Liberal's vote rarely floats.
One could say that they
turn up out of duty. Whe-
ther or not they are the
main launchers of paper
darts is debatable!
That leaves "the Left."
The tide of public opin-
ion of the rest of political
thought (or lack of it, say
the Left)! is that once
you've seen one Lefty,
you've seen 'em all. N o t h -
ing could be further from
the truth. The Left is
split, not only by its
definite subdivisions into
various factions, but more
distinctly by the attitudes
displayed by the factions
themselves I M G (Interna-
tional M a r x i s t Group),
YSSS ( Y o u n g Socialists
Students Society and the
C P (Communist Party)
are the three main conten-
ders in the Left.
The rivalry between
the groups is perhaps best
demonstrated by a few of
the happenings at I C
U G M s . The C P idea
" T a k e a Letter to the
D E S " was shot to pieces
at the last U G M by the
Marxists who called for
individual letters and sup-
port for our actions.
Questions.
1. If you support our
aims, support our ac-
t i o n s — I C I M G .
2. If you support nos
amis, support our
a c t i o n s — B l a c k Sep-
tember Movement.
The C P line was to ap-
peal to as many people as
possible, the I M G op-
posed purely on principle,
substituted altruistic non-
sense in its place, con-
fused the U G M and jeo-
pardised the T a k e a Let-
ter campaign.
Meanwhile, the Y S S S is
battling away in favour of
supplementary grants,
shunning publicity as next
to useless, and basing its
aspirations on a mass
movement involving all
the working and lower
classes to force the Tories
etc.
E v e n more depressing,
than this petty political
manoeuvering is the cur-
rent policy of both Y S S S
and I M G and, to a lesser
extent, the C P of no-nego-
tiation. The methods of
Tio-Pepe D i p l o m a c y have
been rejected because of
alleged sellouts, but per-
haps they were unable to
produce any decent T P
Diplomats. The latest
weapon of the Left is that
of just stating the demand
and allowing no compro-
mise.
Effectively, they send
round a memo to the of-
fending person/body/in-
stitution stating their de-
mands, and receive a po-
lite reply telling them
what do with them.
The whole procedure
smacks of lack of style
and puerile adolescence.
Meanwhile, under the
leadership of the split left
and a confused centre,
I C U must somehow push
the grants campaign
along. It is not likely to
do so until the wounds i n
the left heal, if only tem-
porarily, and U G M s be-
come reasoned and co-
operative. The campaign
will not be won by high-
powered political dogma
from the Left or by low-
powered non-cooperation
from all sections, but w i l l
be won if the U n i o n can
advance on all fronts by
using tactics of truth and
honesty in stating the
facts.

Phosphorous

antl Ferocious Hint
Part nine of the serialisation of the book by
S. J. Swailes
They were out of the shelter of the is-
land by now, and the winds seemed to be
freshening, as the Fanny dipped and rose
over the waves. Ferocious had finally man-
aged to conduct a cup of coffee to the wait-
ing helmsman.
"Thanks, Ferocious," said George, "most
welcome. Y o u might tell the others that I
think we may have to shorten sail i n the
near future." Ferocious looked puzzled.
" B u t they've only just lengthened sail, as
you might say." A n expression of seaman-
like wisdom spread over George's face.
" A h " he said, "that's the sea for you —
never constant for more than a second at
a time. One minute a glassy pond, the next
a raging maelstrom; there's never a dull
moment when you're sailing."
" Y o u can say that again," said Ferocious,
"hardly had I got used to one wall becom-
ing the floor, when it became the roof—
most confusing."
George was right. The weather was cer-
tainly taking a turn for tha worse. White
horses began to appear on the surface of
the sea, and the elderly craft creaked and
protested as she crashed from crest to
trough.
"Come o n ! " shouted George, "get up on
deck, you lot. Some of this sail has got to
come down." Complaining, the trio wriggled
their way out into the open. The strength
of the wind was increasing all the time, and
the leeward gunwale was under water. "I
want the main and the staysail down, we'll
be fine on the mizzen and jib alone," shou-
ted George over the rising howl of the wind.
He was already letting his sails flog to take
some of the pressure off his ancient craft.
The cracking and flapping of the huge
canvas shook the whole boat, and the rigg-
ing throbbed and vibrated in the wind. Gin-
gerly the adventurers scrabbled their way
along the rolling deck, and attempted to
lower the mainsail. The Twigworm was more
hindrance than help, falling over ropes, and
being struck repeatedly over the head
with the boom. But despite this living han-
dicap, Ferocious and Phosphorous managed
to lower the mainsail and the staysail.
George was able to pay off a little, the re-
maining sails filled, and the old boat felt
more at ease again. The now soaking wet
crew made their unsteady way back to the
relative shelter of the cockpit.
Fanny thrashed her way through the
steepening waves, bursting through the
crest of one, and dropping bodily into the
trough of the next. Great gallons of green
water exploded into the cockpit; streams of
spray were flung back from the rigging, and
salt stung the faces of the crew, making
them duck behind the deckhouse.
"I think I'm going to be sick," said the
Twigworm precipitately.
"To leeward, if you have to," said George
quickly.
"Where?" asked the Twigworm.
"That way," said George pointing down
wind. W i t h some jostling the Twigworm
positioned himself, staring over the leeward
rail i n a sickly manner. Secretly Ferocious
was feeling a mite queasy himself, but he
felt bound to keep silent, seeing as the
Twigworm had already mentioned the sub-
ject.
"Not something I want to bring up at
present," he thought and regretted it.
By this stage it was difficult to see much
further than the end of the bowsprit, as
the spray blew across the boat in solid
sheets, and the wind watered their eyes.
The Twigworm was violently sick.
"So that's what the poet meant by 'blown
spume' " thought Ferocious, thankful that
the Twig had taken George's advice about
which side of the boat to stand. But all
thoughts of poets were soon swept from
Ferocious m i n d as he joined the Twigworm
at the rail.
George, however, was in fine fettle, his
hair plastered to his head, salt encrusting
his eyebrows, he hummed a nautical ditty.
Phosphorous'too felt pretty good, and was
rather enjoying himself. He beamed at
George.
"I suppose that's what sailors call 'heav-
ing together'" he said pointing to the dish-
evelled forms of the Twigworm and Fero-
cious. The latter was not amused.
" 0 callous c h u m , " he moaned, "were I
not on the verge of leaving this mortal
coil, I wouldn't half land you one." His head
shot back over the side of the boat. Phos-
phorous' kind heart was stirred, and he
was just stepping forward to help his
friend, when George gave a shout.
"Look! The Twigwormery!" Sure enough,
through the torn seas they could see the
floating refuse tip outline of the Twigworm-
ery — shooting down wind at the rate of
several knots.
"After it!" shouted Phosphorous, and
George leant hard on the tiller. Round
swung the old vessel, rolling as she lay
momentarily broadside on in the trough of
a wave, then steadying as she came off the
wind, the sheets r u n out, and finally surg-
ing away down wind. Now that they were
no longer fighting their way to windward,
there was less water in the cockpit, and
the Fanny was surfing along on the crests
of the waves.
The Twigworm seemed to have recov-
ered instantaneously,
"Ooh, ooh," he squeaked, "quickly, oh
dear, do stop it, catch it, oh faster
please."
"Doing my best", said George. They seemed
to be going at three hundred miles an hour,
streaking down the face of one wave, and
shooting off the top of the next. B u t the
Twigwormery was not hanging around. Its
huge surface area acted as a sail, carrying-
it along at express train speed. However, it
was not exactly sleek of hull, and the Fanny
slowly began to catch it up.
"Oh, oh, we're gaining on it," shouted the
Twigworm, turning blue in the face with
excitement, "Mummy, Daddy," he cried, "it's
me, Gosport."
"Gosport?" said a green-gilled, incredu-
lous Ferocious, "is that your name?"
"Yes," said the Twigworm, "did I not
mention it before? I am sorry. It just never
came into the conversation." Ferocious was
flabbergasted.
" A l l this time," he said, "and we've been
calling you the Tiny Twigworm, when you
have actually got a name all along. Well,
well. What kind of a name is 'Gosport' any-
way?" The Twigworm looked a little sheep-
ish.
" U m , " he said, "you see the Twigwormery
was floating past Gosport at the time of my
birth, and my parents thought it would be
a good name for me." "I've heard worse,"
said Ferocious.
"I think it is a very nice name," said
Phosphorous, encouragingly, "but perhaps
we should go on calling you Twig, to avoid
confusion."
"Good thinking, Phosphorous," said Fero-
cious, "Twig you were and Twig you re-
main — we can keep Gosport for formal
occasions only."
"I don't mind at a l l , " said the obliging
Twigworm.
They were now only forty or fifty yards
behind the Twigwormery, and they could
make out a large Twigworm throwing a
bucket full of potato peelings over the side.
" L o o k ! " squealed the Twigworm, "It's my
Uncle Tubing throwing out the rubbish. He
waved his rubbery arms and squeaked but
Uncle Tubing did not seem to notice.
" B i t slow on the uptake is he? Y o u r
Uncle Whatnot?" asked Ferocious. He
never received his answer for George sud-
denly gave a cry and fell spluttering to
the floor of the cockpit. Without her
owner's hand on the helm. Fanny swung
into the wind, heeling frantically as she did
so, and tipping the crew into a wriggling
heap. It seemed that once again the Twig-
wormery was going to escape them.
