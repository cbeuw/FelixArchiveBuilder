Last Saturday the 1st X I got back to serious busi-
ness with a league match against the league leaders,
Silver Wing. It turned out to be a hard match which
Silver W i n g just managed to win 1—0 with a disputed
goal.
The game got off in a good fashion when straight from
the bully Silver W i n g broke through and hit the post
without an I.C. player touching the ball. Most of the
action then seemed to be centred i n I.C.'s circle, but
Silver W i n g were unable to score as Sid Boulton was
having one of his better games in goal.
During one of I.C.'s bursts of pressure i n the first
half the ball did actually find the Silver W i n g net but
M i c k Downs was, rather harshly, blown up for sticks.
The second half continued i n much the same w a y
with plenty of action in both circles. However, tempers
became a bit frayed and a few people squared up to
each other after silly little fouls.
W i t h only ten minutes of the match remaining Silver
W i n g were awarded their goal. Following a break o n
the right, their centre-forward broke free into the circle
— helped by what seemed to be a foot — and, on the
challenge of the goalkeeper, pushed the ball into the
net with his back-stick.
Overall it was a fair performance only marred by
some of the decisions that R o n Palmer gave i n the
second half, when — i n his own words — it became
to dark to follow a dirty ball.
Team: S. Boulton; R . Cameron, D . Browne; B .
Evans, T . Hanson, G . Popple; A . Tatchell, M . Downs,
D. Richman, J . Astley, C . Dyer.
O n another pitch a few yards away a full-strength
2nd X I entertained a weakened U . C . M . 2nd X I to a
5—0 thrashing. After much argument I.C. gave U . C . M .
a player — the O l d A g e Pensioner — to strengthen
their left wing.
I.C. scored three goals in the first half through A l a n
Brown, Dave Neal and T i m Feline. Dave Neal then
added two more in the second half, but "forgot" to buy
his jug. There would have been many more goals but
for I.C.'s inability to hit the ball accurately towards the
goal.
The O.A.P. playing for U . C . M . o n the L . W . had a n
enjoyable time watching the first team game and i n the
bar afterwards, missed a n open goal i n the first half
and, to everyone's amusement, missed a penalty flick in
the second.
Team: P. Brooks; I. Boyd, P. Foxton; D . Agnes,
A . Brown, S. Bottom; D . West, I. Read, D . N e a l
('Scrooge'), T . Feline.
O n Wednesday the first eleven visited a much-changed
Silver W i n g and gained revenge by coming away with
a 4—2 win. T h e goals came from M i c k Downs, and
three from M a r k Tatchell, one helped in by a defender.
After last week's report, it seems that some people
do not know the special relationship that M i c k Downs
has with his favourite drink, Heineken. Well, towards
the end of last season a few of the P.A.'s gather for a
celebration piss-up. After the bars had closed, this
adjourned with a couple of crates of Newky and Hein-
eken, to 326 Falmouth. A s there were a few party
games going on, the Newky quickly disappeared; so the
participants were then required to drink Heineken. N o w
M i c k Downs, whose timing was slightly out o n this
evening, took one sip of Heineken and immediately left
to have a liquid laugh on the landing outside. For those
who are interested that famous bottle is still o n show
in 326 Falmouth.

Last Sunday the I.C. mixed X I continued o n their
victorious path when they defeated Q . E . C . 2—1. Unfor-
tunately both teams had difficulty i n raising full sides.
T h e I.C. centre-half failed to turn up (pissed again,
Alan), so they unleashed their secret weapon—Godfrey
Everett (who's he?). Q . E . C . were two girls short ("They
haven't recovered from last night!"), so A n n Purvis was
volunteered (a sick joke) to play for Q.E.C., and turned
out to be their star player, until clobbered by the I.C.
captain — their only playing O.A.P.
After an initial burst of Q . E . C . pressure, I.C. began
to play their normal devastating brand of hockey, i.e.
Wonder B o y brilliantly creating open goals but then
making a right cock-up of it. I.C. scored i n each half
— the first from a W . B . short corner, the second from
Poacher Everett. Q.E.C.'s goal came later in the match
followingan individual run b y their right-half.
The memorable points were: Poacher Everett's mys-
tifying display of hockey skills, once he had stopped
playing with the female full back; W.B.'s shooting; and
John Astley's outstanding performance at centre-half.
Team: R . Cameron; Julie Andrews (O.A.P:), G . Pop-
ple; Jacqui Buzzard, J . Astley, Chris Brown; Blossom,
W.B., Janet Manfield, Poacher Everett.
motor cyclists unite!
The motor cycle section is alive and well and living
in a hole under Exhibition R o a d pavement. O u r H . Q .
(hindquarters?) is under the aforesaid pavement in front
of M e c h . Eng. building, access v i a the steps to the
lawn. W e had a very interesting and enjoyable motor-
cycle film show earlier this term as a l l of you who
were there (12)! will know. O u r next meeting is i n the
hole this Wednesday, i.e. the 14th (which is St. Valen-
tine's Day). So come along and show how much you
love your bike any time after 2 p.m.
Future activities include a " B u r n to Brighton" o n
Saturday, M a r c h 10th (leave Mech. Eng. concourse 10
a.m.). If you haven't got a bike and can't arrange a lift,
contact me and I'll do m y best (Cor!). So, see you all
there, and if you have any queries (sweetie) please con-
tact me via Mech. Eng. letter rack or Weeks 36.

Motor sport
Sunday, the 28th January, saw a large entry of 29
drivers for C & G M o t o r Club's first big event, a "Pro-
duction C a r T r i a l " . The thirteen tests which made up
the trial consisted of a variety of mud or gravel hills
and four speed tests. The speed tests were also fairly
varied, containing an "autotest" type test, a hill climb
through a wood and a spectacular water splash.
Despite the complete lack of experience of our dri-
vers, some of them put i n some very respectable per-
formances, even when compared with the four "experts"
from the Cem'ian M o t o r Club. Tony Raine (Mech.
Eng. 1), put i n a sparkling performance i n the Range
Rover and succeeded i n collecting no penalty points
whatsoever. Needless to say Tony took the prize for
the Specials Class. M i k e Mason (Mining), put i n an in-
credible performance in his first competitive event and
despite the handicap of driving a strange car (Malcolm
Newman's 1100), took first place overall. M i k e collected
a total of only twelve penalty points and so becomes
the first winner of the " T u r n b a l l Trophy".
Hot on Mike's heels came the four Cemian, entries.
R o n Whalley (Ford 100E) taking second place overall,
a mere one per cent behind M i k e . Taking sixth place
overall and the second best club member was M a l c o l m
Newman (1100), whose performance was only spoilt by
a poor time through the water. R o b Armitage (Renault)
came i n seventh overall and class winner (his car was
the only one i n its class). Mention should also be made
of Perry (mind that tree!) Newton in 8th place (dented
Escort G T ) , and a surprising 10th place for Pete C r a m b
driving a vast ten foot wide Cortina M k 3 Estate, which
somehow avoided trees which the large cars such as
Escorts hit.
Despite the lack of time to complete a l l the tests
everyone had a great deal of fun (except the trees). B y
next year the organisers hope to have developed inflat-
able plastic trees for the benefit of Escorts and also
they hope to discover a hill too steep for a Range Rover.
M a n y thanks to everyone who marshalled.

W H E R E H A V E A L L T H E R U N N E R S G O N E ?
First the good news: R o b Parker's legs really are the
same length ! A n d now the bad news: The results —
Bereft of our beloved captain and many others through
various injuries and excuses (such as pins and needles
brought on b y hard training), our team has been some-
what under-strength throughout the term.
We didn't mind running or rather squelching the
Q . M . C . 1\ but crampons would have been appreciated
to get out of the odd drainage ditch! Fine performances
by P. Clarke, D. Payne and S. Webb helped the team to
finish in 11th position (out of 12).
A very injury depleted team performed well i n the
3rd league race at Surrey Univ. " G r a n n y " Clarke and
R o b Allinson did well in coming 24th and 36th respec-
tively. Perhaps we were spurred on by having to pass no
fewer than three injured club officials six times during
the race (Rod Parker, captain, H u g h Culverhouse, sec,
J i m Bathrust, treas.).
The less said about the U . C . 5 the better, so I won't
say anything. The next bit comes courtesy of an anony-
mous U . C . P . A . and was found on the X-Country
Notice Board: U C vs. I.C. 31/1/73.
U.C. "Superstars" had yet another totally boring race
v the I.C. Magical Mystery team.
U.C., fielding a very weakened team i n sympathy
with I.C.'s total lack of athletic talent, displayed once
again (boring!!) the qualities that make them worthy
London champions.
However, I.C. put up a very spirited show in the face
of inevitable defeat, managing to clock in the last five
counters in personal best times. R o b Parker was heard
to say, " I knew our lads had it in them".
I conclude this objective, unbiased report of " T h e
Richmond Massacre" (oops! what a give-away), by
sending our deepest sympathies to Peg-leg Parker, the
Master M a r k e r and his Flower People.
Signed A N O N
The bit about the personal bests was not quite cor-
rect, P. Clarke took his down to 29 : 56, D . Payne
knocked his down (yet again!) to 31 : 41, and Pete John-
son is now down to ?????
A team supplemented by guests i n the form of B .
Dabrowski and R . Palmer (U.C. reject would you be-
lieve) came, a close second i n a three cornered match
at Coulsden against a strong South London Harriers
and a pathetic, even by our standards, London Postal
Region team. T h e guests did well, Barry Dabrowski
.was 2nd i n 31:02, the U . C . person was 8th, Paul Clarke
was 4th in 32:25, followed by R o b Allinson 10th, Dave
Pa
yne 11th, Dave Jones 17th, and bringing up the rear
in 42 : 23, the star of the team, Pad Donnelly. Pad says
this performance was due not to his getting lost (for a
change) but to an excess of C o l d Germs and Guinness.
A l s o seen running this term were : R . Maddison,
Kaliray, S. Littlewood, I. Isherwood and Neil Whatsis-
name. D.J.P., A . P . A .
