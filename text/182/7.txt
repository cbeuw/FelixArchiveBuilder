As usual, the Freshers Dinners have left their mark on the Union
in more ways than one. However, it was noticeable this year at the
Guilds Dinners that the freshers showed great spirit and what is
more, intelligence. In general, the more violent types of sport were
reserved for the bar, which received the full fury of this later. Satis-
faction was expressed with the ample supply of beer during the
dinners and most of the speeches were thought to be excellent. Is
there a possible connection between the two ?
At the first dinner, the Mechanicals', at which Prof. Saunders,
the Dean of the College, was present, the pattern was set. This
was followed by the Civils', and everything got a little noisier. Before
the next Guilds' dinner, however, there came an R C S dinner, on
Wednesday, 17th October, and
this was visited by a deputation
from Guilds and Mines, with a
view to delivering a note of pro-
test to the President of R C S ,
deploring the de-bagging of cer-
tain innocent bystanders (who
were simply admiring Theta) the
previous Friday. Much to every-
one's surprise, the deputation out-
numbered R C S in the bar, and
for the sake of amity and the
Union furniture, the three Presi-
dents decided to make it an IC
night. Certain reliable sources
have stated that the evening that
followed was one of the best
seen in IC for five years. The i l -

article is proof of the Bachana-
lian enjoyment experienced by

Lord Mayor's Show
As usual, the day dawned dark
and wet, no doubt discouraging
many prospective onlookers. How-
ever many did turn up to see the
fun, among them some 80 Guilds-
men stationed on a pitch up
Ludgate Hill. The theme of the
procession was ' British Exports.'
In view of the fact that no one
has as yet missed any Guilds-
men, we can draw certain in-
ferences. Five Guildsmen were
on the National Productivity
Council float inflating balloons
with hydrogen gas and releasing
them at intervals. There may be
a connection between the N P C
and balloons ; we certainly can't
see one. We also provided six
sandwich-board men, strolling
round looking like characters
from Alice in Wonderland. A s a
result of his experience, one of
these walking hoardings is seri-
ously considering entering the
profession. His time at I C will
obviously not have been wasted.
Dan ' you can't a rope round
m e ' Rooer wielded an exoert
chopper in the best R C S tradition
(surseons naturally), carving up
meat on one of the floats. He
has got a finger in several pies,
so watch out for him (and
Moonev).
To round off the proceedings,
all 80 Guildsmen accompanied
Bo to Charing Cross at a fast
trot. In keeping with the general
air of festivity, one Macmillan H .
gave an excellent imitation of
Sellers P, at the Lord Mayor's
Banquet later on in the week.
Engineers' Dinner and Dance
At last, Pete Griffiths has been
persuaded to divulge the date of
this most important event,
namely 25th January, 1963. A p -
plication forms for this are now
available from the Union Office
or the numerous College Notice
Boards.
Swimming Ga'a
This occurs on Friday, 30th
November, at Marshall Street
Baths. Come along and give
your support, as in 1961. A pair
of size 423 water wings, with out-
board motor if possible, are
urgently required for one hairy
personage.
Mitch
Mitch was duly returned to
Mines on receipt of his air freight
from Bermuda, the monies being
paid into Carnival funds. Un-
fortunately, R C M were not
pleased with the resurgence of
homosuffragettism on the part of
M'tch's erring keepers.

some prominent members of IC.
The goodwill of the evening even
extended to offering yards of ale
to some visitors from another
London College. Their reti-
cence in accepting the gift was
put down to sheer modesty.
The Electricals' Dinner on the
following night was naturally
rather in the shade of Wednes-
day's proceedings. It was not-
able only for the appearance of a
Spanish drinking vessel, which
was introduced as a Latin Lava-
tory, and provided some damp
sport for the imbibers. This
" p o t " (we don't know whose
arms they are) was kindly
Spanish Drinking Vessel
donated to the Guilds Union by
Frank Irving and it is hoped that
a tradition of beer showers for
courageous freshers might evolve
from it.

noticeable that the bar was
packed and it appeared that
DEBATE
On Tuesday, 20th November,
Imperial College defeated Chel-
sea in the Quarter finals of the
U L U Debating Competition. IC
proposed the motion that ' Space
reseach is a waste of effort,' and
the ensuing debate was a con-
siderable improvement on the
first round. Don Pearson opened
for IC, being followed by George
Turner and Bob Finch, the fami-
liar crushing summary being de-
livered by Asit Chandmal. Chel-
sea opened with discourse on the
meaning of the word ' space,' a
speech probably written for pro-
posing and hastily adopted for
the defence. This rather set the
tone for the Chelsea speeches,
which seemed to lack purpose
and cohesion. On the other
hand, the IC team showed good
co-operation, an improvement on
their first round performance.
It is not yet known who our
S E M I - F I N A L opponents are, but
the support given so far is an in-
sult to the team. A t one time
there were more Chelsea people
present than members of this
College. The standard of
speeches can be greatly im-
proved by a large audience and
if a college like Goldsmiths can
get 250 people to an evening de-
bate, Imperial ought to manage
more than the dozen or so people
that turned up at the last two
rounds.

many Guildsmen other than those
from Aero had come along to join
in the fun. They were not dis-
appointed. Finally the Chemical
Engineering Dinner (last but not
least) was memorable on three
counts. The first was that there
were nineteen members of staff
present from the department, a
record for Freshers Dinners at
IC, which shows that there can't
be much wrong with staff-student
relations in Guilds. The second
was that it was the most drunken
and rowdy (and enjoyable)
Freshers Dinner for some time.
And the third was Jim Carter's

RCS Literary
Society
If you never read any sort of
book other than a scientific text,
this Society is not for you. But
if you are interested in, or per-
haps merely inquisitive about
anything literary, then it is cer-
tainly worthy of your notice.
Active, rather than passive par-
ticipation is our aim. Meetings
usually begin with a talk given
by a speaker noted in his field,
after which informal discussion
takes place over coffee. We want
to cater for those to whom taking
part in as important—if not more
so—than sitting listening. One
can do the latter in General
Studies Lectures, but these sel-
dom, because of their brief dura-
tion and the relatively large num-
ber of people attending, provide
an outlet for more than a few to
put forward their ideas for in-
spection or criticism.
The cynic might claim—-with
possibly some justification—that
we are a group of gasbags who
gather primarily to hear the
sound of our own voices. Never-
theless, there exists in this college
no other society which can satisfy
this demand in such broad
fashion. Certain of our meetings
this term have been of intellec-
tual literary interest —- John
Heath-Stubbs enlightening us on
his reasons for writing one par-
ticular poem, and explaining its
deeper meanings. Others, like
the South African novelist Syl-
vester Stein, describing his experi-
ences while editing in that coun-
try the magazine ' Drum,' had
more popular appeal.
In the very near future several
extremely well-known personali-
ities will be at the Society, so
keep an eye on the departmental
notice boards for information on
our activities. Meetings are nor-
mally on Wednesday evenings at
7.30, so that people may eat first,
and then carry on until talk and
the coffee runs out. So if you
are in the mind for an evening
which is stimulating, and for this
college, new and unusual, try the
Literary Society.
