PROFILE UNION MEETING

THE
REGISTRAR
E. Cutliffe MBE, MA
That M r . Eric Cutliffe should remain so much an unknown
quantity for so many students is no suggestion of an enigmatic per-
sonality, but simply an indication of the nature of his office.' ' Emi-
nence gris ' unhappily has sinister connotations, but it is no exaggera-
tion to say that there is practically nothing concerning students that
does not at some time or other touch upon M r . Cutliffe's extensive
domain.
M r . Cutliffe came to Imperial in 1937 as Deputy Registrar. He
had spent the ten years after graduating in Chemistry from Lincoln
College, Oxford, with Fry's, the chocolate manufacturers. Even in
these days, the College had some vices, he was awarded the M B E
1,100 students, and the new man
' had his nose to the grindstone '
right from the start. In 1940,
having just assumed the office of
Registrar, he left for the Army,
where he spent four years, the last
two of which were at the War
Office. In recognition of his ser-

in 1945.
On his return, he found many
changes, but these were but a
prelude to what was to come.
Although everyone was aware of
the tremendous strides that tech-
nology had made in the wake of
six years' hostilities, few people
could at that time have foreseen
the prodigious upsurge in tech-
nical education that was to take
Dlace a decade later. This has
brought to the Registry changes
as significant as those in the acad-
emic departments.
The registry is now divided
into three main parts, in addition
to which there are specialised
sections dealing with matters as
varied as vacation training and
radiation hazards. The Registrar
is the secretary of the Board of
Studies, which consists of the
Rector and all the professors, and
is broadly concerned with the
teaching arrangements of the
College. Together with the
Academic section which deals
with such matters as changes in
courses, examinations, degree
regulations, this brings the Regis-
trar and his department into very
close contact with the academic
work of the entire College. The
admissions sections alone handles
some 6,500 applications annually,
and although the Central A d -
missions Council on which M r .
Cutliffe is the College's represen-
tative, comes into operation this
year, this does not diminish the
Registry's responsibility. The
third section of the Registry is
concerned with records and sta-
tistics.
What of the man who is re-
sponsible for this large and di-
verse department ? M r . Cut-
liffe is a kindly quietly spoken
person, who conveys an impres-
sion of unobtrusive omniscience
—-as indeed may be expected
from a man so involved with de-
tailed administration. He is
above all an approachable per-
son, and with a hint of sadness,
he reports that relatively few
students avail themselves of the
opportunity of talking with him
about their personal problems in
the hour he sets aside for this on
Thursday lunchtimes.
His spare time is occupied
chieflv by energetic and outdoor
activities—he is a keen gardener,
enjovs dancing, and his holidays
are often spent mountain walking
in Switzerland. When at L i n -
coln, he was captain of his col-
lege boat club. He is apprecia-
tive of good books but confesses
to having no special attachment
to anv particular field of art.
The College owes much to M r .
Cutliffe and to his department.
They are somewhat' backroom ';
their task is painstaking meticu-
lous attention to the needs of
students who are scarcely aware
of what is involved in making
their studies possible.

was some rather vague correspon-
dence whereby the College was
elected ' e n bloc' to the I.C.
Athletic Ground Club. The
Treasurer's report followed and
was kept to a minimum by the in-
telligent move of previously dis-
playing the Balance Sheet on the
Union notice board. A note of
levity was introduced by M r .
Carter's innocent inquiry—' Does
the President of the Union fea-
ture as an asset ?'
The meeting resumed with the
serious business of the R.C.S.
rep. election. The speeches by
the proposers were not of great
eloquence, but seemed to serve
their purpose. M r . Phillips gave
a sensible discourse on the merits
of M r . Massey, but John
Churchill's plea of ' rugger club ''
finally won the post for Bill Jen-
kins by 264 votes to 261. Frank
Fichs was unable to dispose oi
his political past and managed a
count of only fifty.
The final section of the meeting
brought the Annual Debate on
the proposed recipient of the car-
nival charity proceeds. This may
seem to many a slightly distasteful
idea, heatedly discussing the rela-
tive merits of two charities, but
it is necessary, and the underly-
ing note of sincerity atoned for
the system used. The compari-
son between the two charities and
their proposers was interesting.
On the one hand Roger Thomas
with a tremendously sincere
appeal to back the Freedom from
Hunger Campaign—on the other
and no less sincere, Lawrie
Austin for proposing the Mental
Health national appeal. The
tremendous influence which M r .
Austin has in this College (and
quite rightly so), was soon felt
when he began his speech. How-
ever worthy a cause Mental
Health may be, it is a vague and
rather nebulous one, and unlikely
really to gain support in a college
as material and factual as this
one. Yet on the first vote Mental
Health lost by 259 to 270 and
nearly every member of the
council supported it.
M r . Thomas explained at some
length what the Freedom from
Hunger Campaign hopes to
achieve and how it hopes to
achieve it. He mentioned long
term policies of education, irriga-
tion and development;—-also the
pains and horrors brought on by
malnutrition. M r . Austin stressed
the problems in an overdeveloped
society and showed that the
effects were demonstrated in high
mental illness rates, suicides, and
nervous ailments. He too advo-
cated long term policies of pre-
vention rather than cure.
The debate continued hotly
and much was said on both sides
