H A M B U R G A N D A F T E R
In July the I.C. Dramatic Society took their production of " The
Lady's not for Burning," by Christopher Fry, to Hamburg. The
play was rehearsed at the College for a week after the end of the
Summer term ; in that week the final plans for the tour were made,
costumes were fitted and most of the parts were learnt.
The party of 25 left Victoria Station at 3 p.m. one day and
arrived in Hamburg in need of breakfast after the long train journey
from Ostend. The majority of the party lived on a well-organised
camping site, complete with a self-service store, which combined the
amenities of an off-licence, a
grocery and a post-office ; there
was also a restaurant on the site,
complete with multilingual juke-
box and a waiter/barman/come-
dian.
The play was performed in the
Auditorium-Maximum, a vast,
modern lecture theatre with a
huge open stage. The size and
shape of the stage was unknown
to us before we arrived in Ham-
burg, so the set had to be rede-
signed. The stage crew toured
the German Woolworths with an
interpreter and afterwards began
constructing weird pieces with
canvas, wood and string ; the set
was complete with the head~of a
moose (or probably a shorn deer)
kindly loaned to us by the
British Consulate in Hamburg.
The cast rehearsed in a room
underneath the theatre for most
of every day. A n interview was
given for the radio. More tickets
were printed. A t the end of a
week the production was ready
for cerformance.
The audiences comprised
mainly German students and
British, residents in Hamburg:
judging from the laughter and
applause, everybody appeared to
understand and appreciate Fry's
humour. The day after the first
performance there was a critique
in the local newspaper; some-
time that week there was another
rave, this time in the German top
paper, " Die Welt." The British
consulate expressed eagerness to
help us next time.
Next time will be made pos-
sible by the continual support the
Society receives from the College,
officially from the R.C.C. and
privately from the many members
of the College who attend and
participate in our productions.
The Christmas production will be
' Ring Round the M o o n ' by
Anouilh to be performed on De-
cember 4th-7th. Next term two
plays from I.C. will enter the
U . L . U . One Act Play Festival in
an attempt to retain the Clee
Cup. Other plans for next term
include theatre visits, play read-
ings and the Easter production ;
after the Summer Term it is
hoped that there will be another
tour abroad.

If you are rationalist, a positi-
vist, if you devour ' Scutiny' by
the yard and find satisfaction in
Huxley, Russell, Hyer—in short,
if you are a thinking scientist,
then a visit to see Ibsens ' Peer
G y n t ' at the Old V i c may strike
some unexpected chords.
This is only the fifth profes-
then a visit to see Ibsen's ' Peer
in London since it was written
some ninety-five years ago by the
man whom many would place
second only to Shakespeare. It
is a great, shambling masterpiece
which alternates pantomime with
tragedy, turgid prose and laugh-
ing poetry.
Leo Mikern takes the title role,
with a supporting cast of seventy.
As with King Lear, one feels this
part is almost impossible for one
man, running through such a for-
midable range of emotion and
age. Indeed the boggling size of
the whole thing rules out a de-
tailed criticism of performance
and direction, but one or two
almost inevitable flaws aside, it is
a magnificent production.
The epic poem revolves around
two central themes each with its
own countersubject. First the
supreme importance of the indi-
vidual personality against which
Ibsen throws his realization that
•he Eastern pursuit of self-know-
ledge is suicide; secondly the
Christian mystic in Ibsen who de-
clares that the ultimate wrong is
the denial of love and yet sees
that the growth of personality
must involve many such acts.
To the modern mind, many of
Ibsen's symbols are over-explicit
and his ideas dated (he was writ-
ing some time before Freud), but
in this play, everything bounds
along with such genial verve and
intellectual grip that the symbols
live, the ideas loosen and grow.
With all its faults, this is a great
Tour de Force.
As ' Beyond the Fringe ' begins
to sag a little as the jokes become
well worn, ' The Premise,' at the
Comedy, offers a fresh perform-
ance every night. In this revue,
most of the sketches are done on
the spot by the quartet, using
suggestions from the audidence.
This has all the excitement and
anguish of jazz improvisation,
and the talents of the group for
mime are fully exploited in the
occasional awkward pause. The
satire is every bit as vicious and
as sustained as in ' Beyond the
Fringe.' The final sketch ' T h e
End of the W o r l d ' is convulsive
stuff, your reviewer In a pre-
carious standing position (bal-
cony 3/6) being nearly hoisted on
his own opera glasses as the
button was pressed.

fingerprints, proceeded to enun-
ciate his theory with true scienti-
fic thoroughness. He showed the
court a set of British Standard
Fingerprints, and drew the atten-
tion of the audience to their
salient points.
Then he produced a handprint
said to belong to one of the ac-
cused. On this, he pointed out
the salient points from the pre-
vious standards and claiming that
these pointed to the known ten-
dencies of Billingham, one of the
accused. Also produced was an
article of female attire, sent
anonymously through the post.
On this he claimed was found
another handprint similar to that
of the accused. He pronounced
also that the size of the container
was similar to that to which the
accused was known to have an
addiction.
Next called was M r . Graham
Haclin, a paint expert. He was
called upon to identify the paint
on a red and white striped Mitch
sitting on the front of the bench.
After much deliberation he pro-
nounced this as as a rare red and
white striped paint known only
in a small area of South Ken-
sington and producing a can, said
to have been lifted from that
area, he discovered his sample
had dried up. On a suggestion
he should follow suit, he pro-
ceeded to finish his damning evi-
dence with great alacrity.
Finally the prosecution called
a certain M r . Horace Belcher,
who having been sworn in on the
E to K Telephone Directory, in-
formed the court he was a con-
sultant on safe breaking at pre-
sent domiciled in Brixton. On
cross-examination, he claimed he
was consulted on the abduction
of Mitch and on searching the
building had found something
known to us as a paper clip.
This, he claimed, he had found,
in h i ' vast experience of ' knock-
ing off' things, was, in the hands
c o n t from front page.
of an expert, a very dangerous
weapon. (Uproar in court.)
For the defence, M r . ' W e l l '
Dunn claimed that Billingham,
clad in a striped red coat, was a
schizophrenic, believing himself
a Guildsman. His companion in
crime, Voss, was said to be in
love with Michelle, the beautiful
wife of Mitch, and owing to this
mixture of perversion and schizo-
phrenia these men had assisted in
Mitch's abduction. A plea for
clemency was made as the defen-
dants were guilty but insane.
The defendants were led out
and the jury voted. A unani-
mous verdict of guilty was re-
turned. Owing to the previous
soiling of the Round Pond an
unknown member of the jury
suggested they should be led to
the front of the Royal College of
Music to be pilloried and jeered
by the general public. This sen-
tence was accepted and duly pro-
nounced.
The convicted men, struggling
violently, were taken by the sing-
ing rejoicing jury to the pjace of
execution. There, they were
chained and roped to the fence
to receive the derision of a large
crowd hurling kitchen refuse,
who made up in enthusiasm for
what they lacked accuracy.
After much general amuse-
ment, the arrival of a black van
manned by blue gentlemen cut
short the agony of the convicted.
These gentlemen inanely en-
quired if Billingham and Voss
had allowed people to heap such
ignominy upon them thereupon
getting the impression they them-
selves were being threatened
with the same. They forced the
release of the convicted and on
the dispersal of the mob, melted
into oblivion.
