RUGBY SOCCER
IC OUT OF THE GUTTERIDGE CUP
On Wednesday October
21st. the IC Cup side turned
out at Harlington to fulfil what
has almost become an estab-
lished annual function—the
first round of the UL Cup com-
petition vs. CEM. There was
only one change in the IC
team, involving a reshuffle of
the back row to include Foster
in place of Rjavno, who was
not available-
Having won the competition
eight times in the past eleven
years, and figured in the final
for the past five years, the IC
side could be said to be con-
fident of success.
As is usual on these oc-
casions, C E M brought along
with them about 150 fanatical
supporters, whereas those from
IC, despit th„ inducements of
free return transport, could
be counted on. the fingers of
one hand.
The start of the game was
disasterous from the IC view-
point and in a short time- C E M
had an 8 point lead which
can only be described as a
gift. These 8 points were from
a goal which resulted from an
interception bv a C E M centre
from, well within bis nvn half,
and a trv brought about by
la misunderstanding between
the IC left wing and full back
about a diagonal pint to the
IC line. There was a anick re-
ply to this trv. as if IC were
going to shake off their com-
placent attitude, in which a
concerted move down th« rieht
wine brought a try bv Butler
which Molan converted.
By now, the teams had
settled down and it was pos-
sible to make comoariisons-
The C E M side looked well
drilled and fit withou showing
anv individual shine, except
at fly hialf. where plenty of use
was made of some polished
kicking to gain ground.
The IC side looked power-
ful and alwavs potentially
dangerous with the rack play-
ing well, particularly in the
front row, where the experien-
ce of Wronski was proving in-
valuable. A penalty awarded
against IC late in the first half,
some would sav a little unfair-
ly, for not playing the ball
after a tackle, meant that IC
started the second (half trailing
C E M 11 points to 5.
For the bulk of the second
half, IC occupied their op-
ponent's half with several at-
tempts eoine desperately close
to scoring. However, a lead is
nalways easier to hang on to
than to make, so at no side,
the score had only moved to
11—8 through a fiarly easy
penalty kicked by M o l a n .
And so it was a slightly
bewildered I C side that troop-
ed off the field amongst the
throng of jubilant C E M sup-
porters still unable to realise
that they had actually lost.
SWIMMING
Guilds Narrow Favourites
Once again the day of the I C
Swimming Gala is drawing near.
This year, due to the unfortunate
attitude taken by the U L U au-
thorities towards certain occur-
ences connected with the event
last year, the gala will be held at
the Marshall Street Baths (near
Oxford Circus) on Friday, 30th
November at 8 p.m. On the
advice of certain other authorities
coaches have been laid on to
transport spectators to and from
the baths, the coaches leaving
from the constituent College en-
trances.
.. A l l the events promise to be
closely contested with Guilds ap-
pearing to have a slight edge;
Mines, we are told, have been
receiving lessons in the gentle art
of all-in wrestling at secret hide-
out in Fulham, no doubt to get
in trim for the water polo.
Among the other interesting
events, there is the Presidents'
race (tow ropes and all forms of
jet propulsion forbidden) and a
surprise challenge race between
Robin Claridge representing the
Boat Club and Paul Morris of the
Swimming Club—-value to the
winner—three more pints.
Competition Events :
100 yds. freestyle.
100 yds. backstroke.
100 yds. breaststroke.
100 yds. butterfly.
1 length freestyle.
4 x 1 length medley relay.
4 x 1 length freestyle relay.
Water Polo (3 matches).
Your support will be most wel-
come, especially if . . . size 32.
Editor's Note : Rumour has it
that there is a plot afoot to finish
off the evening with a quiet pint
or two in the U L U bar. We asked
the Swimming Captain about it,
but he denied all knowledge of
any such plan.
What is k n o w n for certain
is that a fine night is expected
in the I C bar, as darts match-
es, yards of ale, extensions
etc. are being laid for that
evening.
SQUASH R E S U L T S .
I C 1st V beat St. E d m u n d
H a l l , Oxford 5-0 (Home).
I C 1st beat L o n d o n Hospital
5-0 (Away).
The Soccer Club has recently manoeuvred itself through a very
difficult fortnight. The mid-term climate seems to have affected
us in two ways, making it difficult on one occasion for the usual
seven or eight teams to take the field. Several opaque-eyed players
have been wandering off with grunts of " Must see the woman," and
the greasy grounds have recently caused a large crop of other injuries.
On Saturday, 10th November, the first two teams made the trip
to Leicester ; and although being beaten 0-1, the 1st X I managed t
shake itself out of its apathetic approach to the game. We were hit
by an injury at 1.30 a.m. next
morning. The coach broke
down, we didn't know where, and
at that time passing cars didn't
take too kindly to 22 cold, wet
students. We passed the time by
getting cramp in turn until a
relief coach arrived at 4.0 a.m.
Everyone had recovered by the
following Wednesday, the 1st X I
beating U . C . 2—1 and the 2nd
X I , beating U . C . (11) 3—1, both
at Shenley. (I shall merely re-
mark that the coach broke down
again).
After a run of exhausting
away trips, the spirit of the teams
is at last improving. The ' Stroud
School' had half finished a Rub-
ber when the Captain peered into
the coach for Winchester on the,
wet morning of Saturday, 17th
November. It was still raining
when we lined up against 11 large
physical educationalists. After
fifteen minutes Martin Bellett
(goalkeeper) was taken off with
a cut head and his place taken
by Dave Loftus. A t first the ten
men faltered and were immedi-
ately one down. The long, uphill
fight then began and every man
chased and tackled with such
zest that I.C. were soon in con-
trol. A t this crucial stage we
deserved the stroke of luck that
deflected the ball off a defender
into the opponents' goal. The
second half showed a resumption
of the same pattern of play. The
two wingers (Andy Batcup, Mike
Cox) were tackling like wing-
halves and the rest of the lads put
in a tremendous amount of work.
Even Eddie was sweating. The
winning goal came from a diffi-
cult cross by Mike Eastell for
Cox to head the ball high into
the net. The two pairs of ' Well-
ingtons ' on the touch line (later
discovered to be ' The Austins')
still had enough voice to help us
maintain this position.

ATHLETICS
I.C. retains Relays' Cup
On Wednesday, 14th Novem-
ber, I.C.A.C. took part in the
U . L . Relays and Field Events
competition, having won the Re-
lays' Cup for the last two years.
We again managed to win, beat-
ing U . C . by 16 pts. to 14, inci-
dentally giving I.C. its 1st cup
of the season. This was due
mainly to a surprise win in the
4 x 110 relay, J. Harrison starting
and J. Smith anchoring, both
pulling out fast performances for
the cold conditions and wet track.
Th«setwo also ran away from the
other colleges in the 220 x 220 x
440 relay giving J. Wood a 15 yd.
lead at the start of the quarter
leg, and ensuring anothen win in
137.8 sees. In the last relay I.C.,
weakened by the absence of P.
Clifton, came in 3rd place behind
U.C. and St. Mary's. E , Wilkins
(4 mins. 2C) had a hard run but
could not quite catch J. Farring-
don (4 mins. It), and American
fresher Steiglitze (St. Mary's)
(4 mins. 20).
On field events we were not
quite so successful, missing a
chance to win because of the
prior commitments of some of
our athletes. However, fresher
W. Stabler (10ft. 6 Pole Vault)
W. Martin (140ft. Javelin) and
Williams (Discus), Turner (Jav.)
and Gordan <H. S. J.) competed
very well in the cold to give us
2nd place in the field competi-
tion.
