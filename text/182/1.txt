600 TURN UP
N O A P A T H Y H E R E
The first Union meeting this
year, held in the concert hall on
Tuesday, November 13th, proved
both interesting and informative.
Gathered to vote on a motion
proposing a reduction of the
quorum, were some six hundred
persons, a refreshing sight after
the miserable attendances of last
year. To what extent the crowd
had been lured by the intensive
and almost sensational advertising
by John Preece, and in what part
by genuine interest was soon to
be shown. A t any rate, the secre-
tary must be congratulated on
ensuring awareness on the part of
members of the College.
The meeting opened at 1.15
with a reading of the minutes
which were duly signed despite
general disbelief in their veracity.
Then the first motion was put
before the house—that the post
of Deputy President of the Im-
perial College should be created.
The only speech forthcoming
was from M r . Stacey ; he advo-
cated leaving the decision till
such a time when the need be-
came more pressing. The ensu-
ing silence brought cries of
aoathy from the front of the hall.
Here was yet another example of
what is so often mistaken for
apathy in this College, namely
ignorance. The College did not
debate the topic for no other
reason than that it did not know
or fully understand the injplica-
tions of such a post. Had two
informed and detailed speeches
been prepared, then as was shown
later over the charity, there is no
doubt that the question would
have been debated.
The President did not seem
perturbed when mentioning that
the motion had already received
the required two-thirds majority
at a previous meeting; perhaps
the lack of information proved a
useful method of disposing of an
obstacle left by his predecessors.
A measure of this success was the
vote where not a single person
supported the motion, and per-
haps half a dozen voted against.
The next motion before the
house—that the quorum be re-
duced to three hundred—was
rather easier to understand and
the debate was quite active. The
arguments against the motion
were mainly based on tradition
and the moral wrong of allowing
so small a number to decide for
the entire Union. The point that
a quorum reduction would en-
courage the use of pressure
groups was well answered by the
fact that the limit informed was
a minimum and not a maximum ;
hence any pressure group could
each be countered. M r . Maddi-
son rather short-sightediy men-
tioned that comfort was of pri-
mary importance and therefore
virtually ' the less people—the
better'—perhaps armchairs might
be installed and the quorum re-
duced to thirty. On slightly more
realistic lines, Bob Finch claimed
that ten per cent of the total
number was fair representation
and that in the summer term the
present figure became increas-
ingly difficult to achieve ; thus a
reduction was easily justified.
When the vote was taken, the
President shrewdly estimated that
the two-thirds majority had been
reached and the motion was
passed.

Mitch Guardians Pilloried
On Thursday, 15th November, an event of historic import was
enacted in the Mining Lecture Theatre. For only the second time
in history, Mitch had been lost to barbaric marauders from a college
in the course of demolition, and by public clamour those to blame
were brought to account. The Mitch Guardians were tried by the
Royal School of Mines Union.
The scene was set with all due decorum.(?) From 1.15 onwards,
the jurors filed into the courtroom with appropriately serious expres-
sions to take their places on this, the day of judgment and retri-
bution.
The judge, prosecution and defence entered to rousing cheers
followed by the accused, Billingham and Voss. These, the male-
factors, clad in sackcloth and
ashes, were greeted by boos,
hisses and a shower of kitchen
refuse. Led by two ladies of
M i nes, both renowned for beauty
and poise, the prisoners were es-
corted to the dock, nooses
around their necks. They stepped
into the two plastic rubbish bins
and their trial began.
The judge, His Worship Potato
Oldfield, Lord Chief Justice of
Mines, called upon the prosecu-
tion, M r . ' R o o f ' Slater, to pre-
sent the case against the accused.
M r . Slater, having delivered a
moving introduction on the
gravity of the misdemeanour,
proceeded to call his witnesses.
