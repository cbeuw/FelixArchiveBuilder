' I believe that this College ought to join N.U.S. because I don't
think M r . Mooney should have a monopoly over the catering system.'
This is a remark made by one of two I.C. students discussing N.U.S.!
Now, regardless of one's feeling about the catering system of the
College, this is the sort of crude, illogical, nonsensical rubbish which
is being paraded about Union circles at the present time and which
is intended to raise the ardour of the ordinary Union member to
a feverish pitch so that we may well be pushed into an exploit which
will probably have a permanently damaging effect on the whole of
the life of this College
Mr. Finch, in his article of a
month ago, excelled in his rare
art of rousing fanatical instincts
but carefully avoided trying to
make a factual case for joining
N.U.S. He managed to man-
oeuvre the situation round to the
belief that the majority of this
Union has always wished to be
part of the N.U.S. and that it is
only the supposedly fuddy-
duddies who run the Union that
prevent it. Now let's get this
straight. A t the present time we
do not belong to N.U.S. (a deci-
sion of previous Union members)
and when the motion to join
N.U.S. is presented at the next
Union meeting, it is essential that
the proposers of the motion
should prove, without any doubt,
that it is imperative for the future
eood of the I.C. Union that we
join this National Aquarium of
little fish in too deep water. This
is something which I feel they
will find imoossible to do on a
fact to fact basis.
Firstlv let us consider the aims
of the I.C. Union, and these of
course are more than those to be
found in the Blue Book. A stu-
dent hopes to emerge from a
University having gained a ' little
extra ' to a degree and part of this
' little extra' can be in the form
of general ability in meeting and
handling people and having de-
veloped some powers of accepting
responsibility, however small.
The Union is a means to this end
without the possibility of serious
repercussions following mistakes
through inexperience ; in fact, it
is a proving ground. Here we
find that the Athletic Clubs have
seized the initiative during the
past ten years and have built up
a considerable structure—many
student administrative posts, a
verv wide range of fixture lists,
and the appropriate success story
afforded to the situation where
there are ample facilities for
every member of the Union to
oartake in his chosen sport. The
Recreational Clubs are a recently
formed bodv but in the case of
the Social Clubs, they tend to feel
that they have had the thin end
of the wedge. Now many people
in the S.C.C. feel that their
strength is being restricted by not
meeting outside students and they
feel that by joining N.U.S. they
will be helped.
But who will it really help?
Those who heard Jim Daly (a
Vice-President of N.U.S.) speak
recently were told that the Clubs
to benefit would be the Dram.
Soc. by joining the Drama Festi-
val and the Debating Society by
joining the ' Observer' Mace
competition. However these
clubs must be very limited in the
amount of time they now have
available. The Dram. Soc. have
taken the bit between their teeth
and have now acquired contacts
to make tours during the summer
vac. to Ireland or Germany. The
Debaters, if bored with U . L .
competition could well arrange
debates with other Universities
and Colleges outside this sphere.
Joining N.U.S. will mean that
about six or seven people climb-
ing on the band wagon of higher
politics — a thing which they
aren't here for in the first place.
In turning to the matter of
finance, we approach the argu-
ment of all arguments. A t 1/3
per head it would cost I.C. Union
approximately £200 to affiliate
and on top of this would be re-
required to send about six or
seven delegates to two council
meetings a year (they last about
four or five days). This would
bring the total outlay up to £400
per annum.
At the present time we are
forced to make certain squeezes
in our balance sheet in order
to make ends meet; invest-
ments are at a minimum and
reserves are due to be cut by
£5,000. A s the last quinquenial
estimates for the College were
slashed by the government dur-
ing the pay pause, there is not
much hope of the Union obtain-
ing another penny for at least
three years for maintenance pur-
poses let alone to finance a twice-
yearly outing by six or seven
people who like to be bemused
by social studies. The N.U.S.
balance sheet shows that on a
total outlay of £40.000, it costs
them in the region of £15-£20,000
in salaries to permanent staff to
administer the remainder.
We must therefore get some-
thing tangible for our money. If
we want to join N.U.S., we should
ask ourselves : Does the average
Union member gain by it ? Will
our money be used wisely ? Is it
the average Union member's
wish that we pour our money into
cheap holidays for the few who
can obtain them for 15/- and a
bit of initiative anyway. I doubt
it very much.
T.B.P.
is what it's worth
