Overseas Vacation Service
by J . E . Hamilton
In vain have we waited for a genuine complaint to be lodged
about I A E S T E ' s organisation. N o one yet talked with about their
overseas work has come forward with a watertight reason for moan-
ing, and the nearest indication we have that the arrangements leave
anything to be desired, comes from Gopal Srinivassan, who felt that
the arrangements made for his stay in Norway, so far as living
accommodation goes, could have been better.
He went to Norway in 1961 to work with the Union Company
who manufacture paper. Though he reports that not much was
learned about the work, he feels this to be entirely the fault of the
company who gave him too little to do.

The point he made in our con-
versation was that on reaching
Norway, he found no arrange-
ments had been made for his liv-
ing accommodation, and in a
land where few folk speak Eng-
lish, he found the search for digs
a difficult task.
Whether or not M r . Srinivassan
have handled the problem on his
should have looked into the ques-
tion of digs before leaving Eng-
land, or whether I A E S T E should
behalf, Felix is not entitled to de-
cide, but simply reports the facts
as given.
A t the Skein mill he found
himself to be amongst friendly
workmates who in no way re-
sented his presence there.
During the stay, although there
were neither organised visits to
other factories nor any sight-see-
ing trips to take advantage of, he
did manage to visit the Nors-
keliydro, or equivalent of our
own I.C.I.
Perhaps transport difficulties
prompted the act, but whatever
triggered it off, Gopal found
himself presented with the mana-
ger's own bicvcle to help him get
over the problem. This is an
example of but one of the
friendly attitudes shown by the
Norwegians and Dutch alike, for
Graham Allen, working in H o i - ,
land, received nothing but hospi-
tality from those he contacted
whilst working for Aviolanda on
aero-engine assembly, though he
too felt that he was given too
little work to do.
Here, in contrast with Norway,
English was widely spoken and
those who did not speak much
of our language were keen to
learn.
M r . Allen, staying with a
Dutch family at Dardrecht,
visited other industrial plants such
as the Esso refinery at Amster-
dam and the Delta Works (flood
control dams), arrangements for
these visits being made by the
Foreign Students Service.
His emoloyers paid normal
wages whilst these visits were
being undertaken, and were
quite prepared to allow him three
or four days per week off work
for that purpose.
Both M r . Allen and M r . Srini-
vassan were clearly much im-
pressed by the fact that the
managers of their respective
works took the trouble to make
themselves known, not out of
politeness as might have been ex-
pected, but out of a genuine de-
sire to be helpful and to make
the students feel at home during
their stay.
On the financial side, Gopal
returned to England ' having
made a profit on the venture.
The pay in Holland was quite
good, reported M r . Allen, but
overall he did not cover his costs.
From my talks with students
from various departments, both
men and women, a clear pattern
is already emerging and the
advice Felix would offer, for what
it is worth, is, that it is to your
advantage to get a job with a
company who offers a responsible
job and secondly, if it can be
arranged, that those intending
working overseas will be happier
out of working hours if they live
in a Student's Hostel.
For the next issue, Felix has
hopped a Jet 77 to bring you an
account of America at work and
play.
Rovers,..
Rover Crew Freshers' Hike
Eight stalwart members (in-
cluding an alleged record num-
bers of five freshers) of the
Rover Crew departed for Wrot-
ham—by courtesy of London
Transport—on the exceptionally
cold morning of November 11th,
en route for the annual Freshers'
Hike. From Wrotham the party
made its way along muddy foot-
paths to Ightham, where a map-
reading dispute caused a splinter
group to set off through a large
garden to Ivy Hatch, only to be
reunited at the Plough Inn with
the remainder of the party who
had used the roads and arrived
first. This was considered to be
a good place to stop for lunch
and about forty minutes later,
suitably refreshed and invigor-
ated, a cracking pace was set up
in the direction of Plantol. After
passing through this quaint vil-
lage, Ightham Mote — a fine
example of a moat house, com-
plete with a resident peacock—
was reached. By a further com-
plex system of footpaths, back
gardens, private property and
fields full of heifers (which nearly
necessitated an exhibition of the
technique of bull-fighting, by
those of the party who had been
at summer camp and had seen
how easy it had looked) Knole
Park was reached. This exten-
sive park, full of the four-legged
variety of deer, surrounded a
Tudor Mansion, now the seat of
the Saekvilles. A t about 3.30
p.m., the party arrived in Seven-
oaks and decided to abandon the
idea of returning to Wrotham
along the Pilgrims way on account
of the failing daylight. (The fact
that a Greenline coach going to
London appeared at that moment
had nothing to do with it, so they
say!) By maps and string it is
estimated that about eleven miles
had been covered—giving ample
time for the introduction of the
freshers to the Crew.

Astronomical Society ?
Perhaps as" a subconscious re-
action to the formation of the
Pot-Holing Club, a movement is
afoot to form an Astronomical
Society. Several telescopes have
been found in the immediate
neighbourhood, more have been
discovered further afield and
some interest and encouragement
met with from senior members of
staff. Anyone interested should
keep his eyes open for notices in
the R C S buildings and in the
Union.
Sam-Hem
While few of us wish to know the future, many hope-
reasonably—to have a hand in shaping it; and this
requires acquaintance with what may lie ahead. But
traditional methods of probing the future are no longer
In favour. Crystal-gazing has obvious limitations.
Witches are prophets only of ultimate doom. So today
one turns, in the first instance, to the appointments
officer for the pathways to the future. We, for
our part, would like to elaborate what lies along
one of them—Unilever Research.

Research In Unilever means industrial research:
research directed to specific ends: research with a
practical outcome. But not only that. No industrial
project or problem stands In isolation. Its roots rarely
lie in industry. So, research In Unilever also means
research in a number of contrasting fields—detergents,
edible fats, foods, cosmetics—and It means, further,
research In surface chemistry, glycerlde chemistry,
protein chemistry, and a host of equally fundamental
topics. It means a community of scientific interest within
Unilever, and continuity of academic contact outside It.
It can mean research as a career, or as an Introduction
to the technical and commercial sides of Unilever.
It can provide satisfaction in the pursuit of It and
financial reward In the success of It. There Is only one
minor hazard. Our standards of acceptance are high.
