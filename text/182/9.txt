FELIX

.'" I ' i < J l - S K D A I F,
On the way into College on Friday morning we got a warn-
ing of the weather to come at the week-end. The snow flurries
made the optimists think of snow and made the pessimists think
of sleet and stranded coaches, but the old lags just stuffed a couple
more sweaters on top of ruck-sacks already bulging with two or
three complete changes of clothing.
By seven o'clock on Friday evening a very assorted group of
people had gathered outside the Union. They varied from smart
young men who hadn't been able to get back to digs to change,
to young ladies who made Alpine
climbers look slightly obsessed
the only common denominator
being bulging ruck-sacks. Our
coach left the Union at ten past
seven, three transport cafes and
thirteen hours later we arrived in
the cold grey morning at Eskdale
Youth Hostel.
At half past ten we set out in
groups varying from those intent
on ' doing ' Scafell Pikes to those
who just wanted to have a look
over into Wardale. Throughout
the morning there was low cloud
and squally rain, the ground was
exceptionally wet even by Lake
District standards, stoney paths
were streams and everything else
was ankle-deep mud. A t lunch
time the weather deteriorated(l)
and there was heavy sleet in the
valley. Soon after three o'clock
the first bedraggled group re-
turned to the Hostel; as the
various groups came in, so the
string of dismal stories length-
ened. By five o'clock it was dark
and two groups were still out, one
was a large group that had gone
up to Hill Tarns and the other a
couple who had left the Wardale
group and gone up to the ridge
above Wast Water. A t ten past
five the latter pair appeared sur-
prisingly dry, having got above
the sleet into snow and so not
started to get wet until descend-
ing. They had met the road near
a pub that put on meals at any
time and their description of egg
and chips and a pot of tea soon
made them unpopular with the
others who had not had anything
warm since breakfast and still
had two hours to wait! The
other party appeared soon after-
wards very wet and tired having
got lost, finally walking back by
road from Langdale.
On Sunday we were wakened
by the wind howling round the
Hostel and during breakfast
watched snow being driven down
the valley. By eleven o'clock the
snow had stopped and the sky
slowly cleared until by three
o'clock the views of the snow
covered valley were wonderful.
As we gathered back to wait for
the coach, those who had ven-
tured on to the exposed ridges
told of gale force winds driving
the fallen snow into blizzard con-
ditions.
As we left with the sun sinking
over the snow covered hills we all
agreed that we would come again
next year and that we must
organise another trip next term
while there was still a possibility
of snow to transform the English
mountains into this wonderland.
JUDO CLUB
I.C. UNION DEBATE
'That this House has no confidence in H.M. Government
Proposed by . . . JOHN MORRIS M. P.
Opposed by. . . . . PAUL CHANNON M.P.
Concert Hall at 1p.m. on Thursday, 29th November
In the Chair Asit Ghandimal
The Judo Club after a long period of temporary occupation in
the gym now has a permanent mat situated on the top floor of the
west side of the R C S building. There is a training session every
Tuesday night at 6 p.m. for graded members, under Dave Barnard,
3rd Dan, and a beginners' class every Thursday at the same time,
taken by John Shepherd, 1st Dan, ex-captain of the club.
Over the past year the club has been very successful, beating
teams from Sandhurst, Oxford University, and University of London
College Clubs, but na rrowly losing to Cambridge. Much of the
credit for this is due to Dave Barnard, the instructor, who is also
a member of the British Judo Team. For this session matches have
been arranged with Oxford, Cambridge, Southampton, and Leeds
Universities, together with a number of fixtures against college sides,
and two with the Metropolitan Police.
This year, the team has lost
two good performers in John
Milson and Roger Simons, the
former showing a marked propen-
sity for throwing opponents
through windows, the latter pre-
ferring slow strangulation. N o
doubt, our enemies will have
heaved sighs of relief at their ab-
sence, even if they heave nothing
el se. We are still left, however,
with many of last year's team,
among them last year's captain,
Clive Cohen, John Beasely, trea-
surer, and of course, Robin Bed-
ding, 2nd K y u , vice-captain, and
also a P G who is interested in
breeding flies.
Newcomers to the club are
mostly beginners whom we are
glad to see in such numbers, and
we hope that they can overcome
the initial difficulties of a diffi-
cult sport.
We are extremely fortunate at
the moment in having a dojo in
RCS. This will be eventually
moved to somewhere in the East
side of Prince's Gardens. The
dojo is due to the efforts of Dr.
Cameron, President of the Club
and 1st K y u (Brown belt).
Having accommodation of our
own is rather important as it
means that the mat can be down
all the time and members can
practice whenever they wish.
This has undoubtedly contri-
buted to the high standard of
Judo and keenness in the club
over the past year.
For graded members there are
additional practices and instruc-
tion at the Renshuden at 3.15 on
Wednesdavs, and at 6.0 p.m. on
Friday nights at U L U , IC Judo
Club members being automati-
cally members of U L Judo Club.
A l l in all, if you do wish to prac-
tice Judo, a high standard of
facilities is available.
Depleted IC Team
thrashes Goldsmiths
The first match of the session
was fought at the Renshuden
Club on Wednesday, 31st Octo-
ber against our old enemies,
Goldsmith College. Usually we
have no reason to fear Gold-
smiths', but on this occasion we
were fielding a somewhat depleted
side due to the injury of our Cap-
tain, Mike Warne, and the non-
availability of our tame (almost)
blue belt, Robin Bedding. Never-
theless, the IC team scored a de-
cisive 5—1 victory.
First to fight for IC was new-
comer Pete Hunt who rapidly re-
covered from an illegally applied
strangulation hold, and threw his
opponent clearly for a full point.
Next came Bob Mee, another new
team member, who quickly dis-
posed of his opponent, gaining
a submission in response to a
hold on the ground. Malcolm
Matthews followed this by a
clean T A I O T O S H I throw for
another full point, John Beasely,
4th, being forced to submit to a
dubious looking neck lock, John
Downey, starting cautiously,
finally threw his opponent with
I P P O N SEOI N A G E .
T o round off the match, Clive
Cohen felled the last Goldsmiths
man with H A R A I GOSHI, and
yet another win was chalked up
for the I C Judo Club.
BADMINTON
-John H . Weddle
From the large crop of freshers
who yearly flirt with the club at
the beginning of the season a
number of good players have
emerged as witnessed by their
entry into the teams.
Yap and L i m , both Malayans,
have played for the seconds but
are first team possibles. The
former played for the first team
against Cambridge Cockerels, the
University's second team, the re-
sult being 7—2 to I.C.; whilst
L i m helped in the 9—0 devasta-
tion of Northern Polytechnic.
Changes do take place in the first
team yet the combination of
Dennis Foster and Chris Harvey
seems invincible, for on looking
through the records this pair has
not been defeated whilst playing
together in the last three years.
With the influx of new players
the Second team is still trying'to
find the winning combinations
having lost 6—3 to Kings I and
rather narrowly to 3toyal Vets
5—4. But in these and other
matches R . Leary has shown him-
self to be a player of great poten-
tial.
The ladies team has entered its
match programme winning as
usual in its own inimitable way.
Thus they beat L.S.E. with two
members of the team never hav-
ing played before.
The unassailable confidence of
the ladies led by Jacqueline
Brown and Beryl Milner, allied
with the members of the Men's
I team bodes well for the Mixed
Team and was vindicated by the
teams' 6—3 win over L.^.E.
