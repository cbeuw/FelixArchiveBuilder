Despite the absence of your
favourite column, the last issue
was pretty good value for 4d. (I
hope that you paid for yours,) I
doubt if M r . Marples would ap-
preciate the way B o was driven
to Brighton though. In the Felix
photograph, the driver appeared
to be looking at his rear seat
passenger. Still, I suppose that
Bo knows her own way to Brigh-
ton by now.
The rival publication, Sennet,
is suffering from a boom in its
sales this year. The IC Sales
Manager, who receives a con-
siderable commission, employs
elaborate scientific methods in his
sales campaign, and it appears
that garaphical curves are more
efficient than curvaceous sales
girls.
In the previous issue, I pre-
dicted that I C would win the U L
Triple Crown (Soccer, Rugby and
Hockey Cups) again this year
Unfortunately this is no longer
possible—due to the efforts of
that little college off High Street
K e n . — C E M . Although only a
tenth our size, they have already
knocked out our Rugby Team in
the first round and held our Hoc-
key Team to a draw. The most
disappointing feature of these two
games was the lack of support
given to our teams. This was
not made any easier by C E M
supporters turning up in large
numbers on each occasion. It is
to be hoped that the College will
support the Hockey Team in the
replay on December 5th and the
Soccer Team in their Cup en-
counters.
By now you must all be aware
that Imperial is the only Univer-
sity College not affiliated to N U S .
There is a strong movement in
the Union to get us affiliated, in
fact the issue will be debated at
the next Union meeting on
January 17th. Colcutt, like
Asit Chandmal, is neutral.
There are, of course, argu-
ments for both sides. The Social
Clubs appear to want us in, while
the Athletics Clubs and ' the Es-
tablishment ' want us to stay out.
The rift between these two fac-
tions has become intensified of
late : it is to be hoped that every-
one will keep their heads and
come to the Union meeting to de-
cide our .fate like sensible adults.
Where have the cartoonists got
to ? Surely I C has some funny
subjects for cartoons ? H o w
about one of the President dis-
banding the Chinese Society. Oh
well, cartoons or not, Felix is still
worth buying—who knows, it
might be your turn for a profile
soon.
Carnival Magazine Needs Y o u
S T Y N X is coming, but to make
it a real success, it needs your
help now. Articles, jokes (of a
semi-repeatable nature), cartoons,
ideas of all sorts, all are urgently
required. Anyone interested
should contact any of the Carni-
val Organisers.
Dear Sir,
Again the Union has been per-
suaded by a vocijerous minority
to support an International
Charity. Are we again to send
our hard-earned money into the
empty void of the Afro-Asian
countries ? How many of the
Union have seen the letter from
the War on Want Organisation
thanking us for help last year 1'It
is typed on the best quality paper
available; such as can only be
found in the most exclusive estab-
lishments in London—is this what
is called negligible administration
costs ?
What have we received from
the Freedom from Hunger Cam-
paign Organisation ? Vague
promises that they will send us
lecturers, and little else. Does
this help our already overworked
Carnival Committee ? From the
Mental Health Campaign Organ-
isation we have received definite
offers of collecting licences, col-
lecting tins, co-operation from the
police, and, in fact, all the help
of which they are capable of
giving.
1 call on all thinking members
of the Union to reconsider the de-
cision which was carried by such
a narrow margin at the last Union
Meeting, and demand that this
year's Carnival proceeds go to the
Campaign against Mental Illness.
Yours,
J. DAUMAN.
Dear Sir,
I have just read the back page
report of Morphy Day. It's not
true. I was on the third floor of
Beit Hall at the time. Also, the
boat club has not, as rumoured,
paid my year's subscription to the
Rugby Club.

Dear Sir,
The last issue of FELIX car-
ried a report of the Harlington
Hop. Having been to the Hop
and read the article, it was diffi-
cult to reconcile the two. To
voice the opinion of those attend-
ing, the evening was a lively suc-
cess and certainly not dissipated
with the gloom and groans which
you suggested. Perhaps your
contributor was not aware that
this was one of the ' bring your
own partner' IC functions, or
that H-rr-d- had supplied the
rockets without sticks, and as a
personal opinion he did not like
the band.
Yours sincerely,
R. W. SLATER, RSM.
Mr. Slater is trying to read
something into the article that
was not implied. A s regards the
band, in our opinion it was some-
what anaemic. A n y other com-
ments ?—Editor.
A N Y O N E I N T E R E S T E D ?
Dear Sir,
The Oxford Committee for
Famine Relief are organising a
gigantic pub crawl on Christmas
Eve.
The idea actually is not to get
participants sozzled, but to collect
a vast amount of money in the
shortest possible time from un-
wary Yuletide revellers.
Offers of assistance, together
with addresses and whether or not
cars are available will be appre-
ciated bv Mrs. Evans, Room 17,
R.C.S. Building.
Yours faithfully,
ANNE EVANS.
