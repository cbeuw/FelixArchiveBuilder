So, the Queen has visited IC. I would like
to say that the event will be remem-
bered by those students present for years
to come, but it simply isn't true. Hun-
dreds of students (both inside and out-
side the BMS) were waiting to sec her
Majesty, and all they got was a fleeting
glimpse as she moved between car and
lobby. No 'walkabout' - not even a
friendly wave and pause for amateur
photographers. Maybe I am bitter, as I
was not presented to her Majesty and,
let's face it, the real reason she was in the
area was to open the renovated Albert
Memorial - we merely provided a one
hour hors d'oeuvre. Many students will
remain disappointed, however.
Furthermore, the speeches and

entire ceremony focused on Imperial's
'New School of Medicine'. Now I am
not one to criticise medics, and their
presence at South Kensington is indeed
very welcome, but as a former biologist
I would have appreciated more acknowl-
edgement of Biology's role in the new
building. It is, after all, the Biomedical Sci-
ences Building, and not just the Alexan-
der Fleming Building.
Not one to let sleeping dogs lie, it
was with considerable amusement I stud-
ied the model of Soulh Kensington
erected in the BMS for the occasion. It
was a good model, a very good model
- too good, in fact. The pond in the
middle of the Queen's Lawn was cer-
tainly a surprise, and Dalby Court looked
as though it had been taken straight
from a Cambridge college. Okay, so it
was how the campus will one day (cons
in the future) look. I just can't help feel-
ing that by the time the 'temporary'
boiler house has been removed, our
"attractive car-park" (see letters page)
has been built, and some rare and
expensive trees have been found for
the Court, Prince William will be drawing
his pension.
On a less cynical note, however, the
college must be congratulated for organ-
ising the event in the first place, and for
dealing admirably with a falling door and
failing lifts. It was certainly a good day for
Imperial College; as for its students...
well, you can decide that one.
