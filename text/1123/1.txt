The S t u d e n t s ' N e w s p a p e r at Imperial C o l l e g e
''Stars in a constellation
By Ed Lanyon and William Lorenz
So said Her Majesty the Queen of Impe-
rial College and the Royal College of Art
during a visit to the area last Wednesday.
Her Majesty started proceedings at Impe-
rial, opening the new Sir Alexander Flem-
ing (BMS) building. After an initial panic
in the afternoon when a brick-covered
outer door collapsed, damaging one of

the building's supporting columns, the
site was groomed to perfection by the
time of her arrival.
Her Majesty was welcomed by the
Rector, Sir Ronald Oxburgh and pre-
sented with a bouquet by a descendent
of Sir Alexander Fleming. She was then
shown a scale model of South Kensing-
ton including a lovely pond on the
Queens Lawn and Dalby Court with a
strangely absent boiler house. Her
The tour included a live pharmacol-
ogy practical in which first year medical
students tested on themselves 'the effect
of various chemical compounds upon
their sharpness of vision'. Her Majesty
then officially opened the building and
signed the College's new Royal Charter.
This was followed by a speech by the
Rector, who made a very funny remark
about the building collapsing. Everyone
was tremendously amused.
Her Highness left behind some dis-
enchantment, failing to fully acknowl-
edge the 200 strong crowd on her
entrance and exit. No doubt this was
the result of her full schedule, next involv-
ing a move north to the Albert Memor-
ial and a spectacular opening ceremony
involving fireworks, apparently costing
£25 000.

Majesty was introduced to all Imperial's
important persons including Dave Hellard
and Wade Cayed, leaving her perplexed
as to why Imperial has two union presi-
dents. Ignoring several 'commissioned
montage panels featuring key figures
and developments in the history of the
College' which were obscured by td Sex-
ton and other dignitaries, she then
started her tour of the building, but was
forced to use the stairs because the lifts
were broken.
Suspect Speakers Back Again
By Duncan Hill
In what is becoming an annual occur-
rence, dodgy white vans have appeared
in the area of Imperial College. Not only
do they claim that the speakers they sell
have an r.r.p of around £1800 and they
will sell them to you for a mere £200, but
they'll also give you a lift to the nearest
cash point to draw your money out for
you.
Last year one Imperial student was
kidnapped by these people and forced
to withdraw £200 from a cash point.
They may also offer to take you to your
flat etc. to try them out, but the going
advice is; under no circumstances must
you get into this van. The speakers them-
selves are not what they claim to be, and
if you did spend any of your hard-earned
cash on them, most likely they would
cause even more damage to your hi-fi.
If anyone sees these vans attempting to
sell speakers, they should be reported to
Felix, along with the vehicle registration
plate, descriptions of the occupants and
details of any conversation held. Once
again, do not hand any money over, or
get into the vehicle; as ICU's president
Dave Hellard says, "they rely on idiots.
Don't be one".
