Small Soldiers * * *

hanks to the success of Toy Story
three years ago, film execs have
been falling over themselves to re-
create the "Wow" factor that surround-
ed the adventures of Buzz, Woody, Mr
Potato Head et al. Consequently, the
next few months will see the release of
Antz, A Bug's Life, Toy Story 2, Prince of
Egyptand Iron Giant, all benefiting from
the magic of CGI, with not a hand-
drawn eel in site.
First out of the bag, however, comes
Small Soldiers, the story of a boy and his
sack of plastic figurines. Following a plot
not a million miles away form Toy Story,
ayoung boy (Smith) takes possession of
the latest toy on the market - in this case
the military Commandos and their foe,
the peaceful Gorgonites. But everything
starts to go wrong when the implanted
munitions chips activate, leading to a
full scale war between the opposing
forces. Massive devastation results, with
the eponymous toys turning on Smith
when he rescues the Gorgonite leader.
Whilst on paper it probably seemed
like a great idea for a film, the reality is
far from satisfactoty. Toy Story succeeded
because it appealed to adults and chil-
Chlp Hazard .- Voice of Tommy Lee Jones,; BodyofArnle
dren alike, whereas Small Soldiers is too
scary for small children, yet too idiotic for
adults. That said, the visuals are still spec-
tacular, and some of the cameos (form
the likes of Dennis Lcary and Phil I lart-
man) provide moments of joy. Even so,
like so much of modern I lollywood, take
away the CGI and there's very, very little
left. Q

Win tickets to Exorcist courtesy of
KENSINGTON
With I lalloween fast approaching,
film studio executives on high have
decided that it might not be a bad idea
to re-release The Exorcist, complete with
a freshly spruced up stereo soundtrack.
And who's going to argue?
More importantly, cinema execu-
tives much closer to home have decided
that giving away tickets to penniless stu-
dents would be kinda nice. And I'm def-
initely not going to argue with that.
So, thanks to those ever-so-nice peo-
ple at the Odeon Kensington, Felix offers
you the chance to win a pair of tickets to
what is widely recognised as one of the
scariest movies ever made (which is still
banned from video release).
For your chance to win, simply
answer the following question:
In what year was The Exorcist
first released?
Email your answer to fllm.fellxÂ®
ic.ac.uk before 6pm on Tuesday to be in
with a chance. Winners will be drawn at
random from the virtual hat.
The winners of last week's Hal-
loween 1120 competition were:

They correctly identified that 1120 is
the seventh Halloween film to be
released. Please drop into the Felix office
(in the Quad archway) to pick up your
tickets.

The Sting
Reuniting the team that made Butch
Cassidy & Fhe Sundance kid a hit obvi-
ously seemed like a great idea back in
the early seventies. Consequently, the
on-screen pairing of Redford and New-
man, plus director director George Roy
Hill were brought together one again in
1 973 for The Sting.
What resulted still stands as one of
the greatest caper movies of all time.
The twists and turns lead inexorably to
the final climax, which is simply a joy to
behold. A classic.
Grease
You've all seen it, I know you have
- no matter how much you might deny
it, the simple fact of the matter is that
the whole world's seen Grease - and
99% of them loved it. So stop living in
denial, and instead get some friends
round in front of the TV and relive the
experience as God intended - with
cheering singing and plenty of drink.
Saturday Night
Fever
It's a source of constant surprise to dis-
cover just how many people there are
in the world who haven't seen Saturday
night Fever. We all recognise the songs,
can flawlessly parody Travolta's danc-
ing, and have the image of the seven-
ties that SNF portrays etched on our
minds. Yet far too many of those
amongst us haven't seen it. And that's
just not good enough.
Saturday Night Fever gave the world
John Travolta, the Beegees and an
image of the seventies that simply
defines a generation.
Nightmare on
Elm Street
OK, so Wes Craven is hardly one of the
greatest directors of all time, but when
it comes to scarring the shit out of peo-
ple, he could still teach Orson Welles a
few lessons. Witness Nightmare on Elm
Street, and ignore the jaded legacy of
utterly forgettable sequels, and you'll
realise what horror's all about.
