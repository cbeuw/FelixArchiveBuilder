WILD 9 (Playstation) Lemmings (Playstation)
Shiny Entertainment
Wild 9 is the new game from Shiny Enter-
tainment. It is a single player platform
game and has many similarities to Shiny's
most well known game - Earthworm Jim.
The gameplay is basically the same as
any other platform game, with the req-
uisite sub-games and puzzles. I he plol
is the usual kind thing you get - you play
as Wex Major ("Earth teenager and reluc-
tant hero"), leading
the Wild 9 (a group
of 9 wild "misfits")
against the villain
KarnC'a gargantuan
villain with a taste
for inter-planetary
redecorating").
Although this does-
n't sound particu-
larly interesting so
far there are a number of reasons for it
being one of the better games of its
genre.
Number 1: the game is a very pol-
ished and impressive production. The
graphics, sound effects and soundtrack
are high class. Especially for platform
game, the 3D graphics are superb. Num-
ber 2 is your weapon, the Rig - "the
galaxy's most powerful weapon". Well,
that's quite a big exaggeration, but it is
interesting playing with it for a while. The
game still wouldn't be very good without
the main reasons. Which are number 3:
its sense of humour, which is seen quite
vividly in number 4: your ability to torture
your enemies. You can trap these stupid
creatures and blow them up, burn them,
decapitate them, drown them, slice
them, electrocute them, impale them
or puree them. This is fun. You can also
use them as bridges to get over pools of
acid. This is also fun. The only problem
is that creatures look too ridiculous to be
realistic and the pleasure from sadistic
torture is diminished.
It would be much
more fun if your ene-
mies were 'cute'
fluffy animals or peo-
ple, except that of
course the Daily Mail
would start a hate
campaign and the
game would be
banned. I'm not just
detailing all these torture methods
because I'm a sadist. It is essential to
learn the right way to kill a certain crea-
ture before you can proceed.
Overall then - if you like platform
games I would definitely recommend it.
It is well designed and the 13 different
worlds makes for an extensive game
area. The puzzles and general game-
play is good. Otherwise, although it is a
fun game it gets a bit repetitive after a
while, and generally is not very original.
It is a platform game after all.

Tomb Raider III
Lara is back. With the latest dose of Run-
ning, jumping and provocative bum wig-
gling being promised for November 15th
the hype machine is into gear with 5
minute cinema adverts and press launch
parties at the Natural
History Museum win-
ning over the press in
one evening.
Once again tomb
Raider will make the
number one chart by
Christmas with the
new lighting effects
and the emphasis on
more puzzle ele-
ments. This should make the game a mix
of the pure action Tomb Raider II game,
and the very puzzle orientated Tomb
Raider, from what I managed to see
there are some very nice touches with
the Al being tweaked allowing Lara to
hide from the baddies, and guns smok-
ing after being fired. The London scenes
looked very impressive with rain in the
outdoor parts and nice church stained
glass effects in the indoor parts. Ihe
Playstation version is also tweaked and
now runs in high-res mode (it makes her
breasts slightly less pointy). The trophy
of the night were 30
cm high golden stat-
uettes of Lara herself.
Journalism being a
honourable profes-
sion they ail dissa-
peared before the
end of the night.
We will be
reviewing this as
soon as we get a
copy and we fight it out on who gets the
copy to review. Now where is my
favourite broken newcastle brown bottle.

Psygnosis
following on from the release of the
old arcade classics on the Playstation it
appears that the release
of PC classics on the PS
is in full flow. Psygnosis
has decided to release
Lemmings and the
sequel 'oh no not more Lemmings' on
the Playstation masses. Since 1991 Lem-
mings have plagued over 3 million peo-
ple with their appalling stupidity and
their ability to step into furnaces, off
high platforms and generally lo endan-
ger their lives in entertaining ways. Only
determined and frantic activity meant
the difference between a load of live
lemmings and a horrible pile of mush on
the ground.
So basically it's a 1991 game being
released in 1998. The game is still as
good as it always was, even if the PS con-
troller is a pain - hopefully the PS mouse
will be supported in the full version (it
should make it much more like a game
and less like an instrument of torture).
You have your usual limited motley crew
of special lemmings. Digging, mining,
floating, climbing, bashing, bridge build-
ing and best of all the bomb lemmings
(turn your lemmings into small bundles
of semtex and blow your
way through the wall). The
graphics are nice but noth-
ing special and as puzzle
games go it is a good and
worthy classic game but when compared
against newer puzzle games like kula
world it does reek of a early 1990's game.
A game worthy of game of the year, it's
a shame that the year happens to be
1992.

Red Alert - Retaliation
(Playstation)
Virgin Interactive • • • •
You've done the world domination bit in
Red Alert, taken the Soviets to London or
the Allies to Moscow and generally spent
several sleepless nights going through
your mind whether you should have
built another ore refinery rather than
that spanking new tank.
What has Retaliation got
to tempt you to go on
another mass killing
spree?
Well there are new
and powerful weapons, §|
which go towards balanc-
ing the power of the two sides on land
and sea. The Soviets get missile launch-
ing subs to match the allied cruisers,
and tcsla tanks and infantry to provide a
bit of punch to the soviet attack. The
allies seem to get the raw end of the
deal with the only new important
weapon being the ehronotank which
has the habit of being
able to pop up behind
the lines of battle chew-
ing enemy base for
lunch.
With this new
armoury there arc 32 new
missions (16 for each side) to tackle
which go from the fairly straightforward
to the incredibly annoying and difficult.
This is compounded with the problem
that games can only saved after com-
pleting a battle and not during the bat-
tle. There are also new cut and intro
sequences - yes eye candy perhaps but
anything for a bit of atmosphere.
Also with a nearby friend with a
spare Playstation and TV, the PlayStations
can be linked up and old scores can be
settled using the blood of
WKf your troops rather than using
~" a broken newcastle brown
bottle, (frankly grinding their
noses into the floor in this
game can be very satisfying
and less likely to have you at
one of Her Majesty's Hotels.)
The game is not perfect though.
Without a mouse it is a pain to move
across the map quickly enough and dur-
ing the link up game it occasionally
decides to slow down to a complete
crawl. Also comparing it against the PC
version it does come second with lower
resolution on the screen and an inabil-
H ity to play it across a link
more than a few metres and
more than two people. But if
you have not got a PC and
have missed out on the orig-
inal Red Alert go and buy it.
Though don't blame me if
your skin starts to pale and eyes become
sunken because of lack of sleep.
