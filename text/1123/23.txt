CHRIS OFILI
Serpentine Gallery, Hyde Park
A
s a scientist, the idea of talking to
other scientists about art scared
me... It scared me a lot! To help
overcome my initial lack of confidence,
I phoned and enlisted the help of my
best friend who rather conveniently hap-
pens to be a student at the London Insti-
tute (Art College to you and II). She kindly
offered to come with me, boyfriend in
tow, to investigate Chris Ofill's solo exhi-
bition.
It's easy to hate art simply because
you don't want to try to understand it. It's
even easier to hate modern art because
it looks so ridiculously basic. But when
you actually stop and try to analyse the
idea behind a piece of work, you'll soon
see it's not as simple as it at first
appeared. As a rather cynical biologist, I
always cringe when I hear that modern
art doesn't need any one particular
meaning or that it can be interpreted as
the individual sees fit. This to me, in
most cases, is a cop-out and allows artists
to escape from trying to convey a per-
sonal thought or opinion in pictorial or
sculptural form. Art should have some-
thing to say, and if it doesn't, then there's
no point to it.
Now, if I were an honest person, I
would say that I went along to the exhi-
bition with an open mind. However, a tad
more realistically, I'd say that I was
expecting It to be rubbish. Well, "was it?"
I hear you cry: the answer is I'm not
sure. The first thing that greeted me on
walking into a large white room was a
piece entitled Shithead '93. this little
gem of a sculpture was composed of a
lump of elephant dung mixed with resin
and decorated with Chris Ofili's own hair.
Picture it yourself,
a lovely image
I'm sure you'll
agree! Despite
making me laugh
a lot, this made
me realise that
Ofili, like Damien
Hirst, enjoys to
shock people
with the strange
and obscure.
The elephant
dung was a fea-
ture found ir
nearly all of the
pieces in the
exhibition.
Indeed, most of
the large collages
were propped up
on two large
mounds of the
stuff! This, accord-
ing to the insane
art critic who conducted a tour of the
gallery, was done so that the "3-D qual-
ity of the work could be fully appreci-
ated". Hmmnn... Nearly all the reviews on
Chris Ofili have concentrated solely on
the elephant dung (which is probably, in
my opinion, why he used it in the first
place). Not wishing to follow suit, I have
decided not to do this, but I will tell you
that anyone who brings tons of dung
heaps back from a painting scholarship
in Zimbabwe and then endeavours to
? display them
on a market
stall has to be...
Well, you judge
for yourself.
Chris Ofili's
other influ-
ences include
prostitutes,
pimps, drug
dealers, hip-
hop and blax-
ploitation films
from the 70s.
He seems very
keen to appeal
to the young
and "trendy"
with his use of
70s and porno
imagery. Virtu-
ally every piece
has someone
with a massive
Afro hidden in
it somewhere and you find yourself con-
stantly looking for the bad, naughty or
disgusting ideas and images - at least, I
did!
One of the aspects of Ofili's work
lhal did appeal to me was the fact that
his work was very detailed. Many of his
psychedelic collages revealed more on
The Adoration of Captain Shithead and the
Legend of the Black Stars, 1998
closer inspection than they did at first
glance. My favourite piece was, rather
boringly perhaps, a pencil drawing of
hundreds of little faces arranges in circles,
entitled Untitled '96. I think the main rea-
son for this was because of its intricacy
and the fact that it was a welcome break
from resin, acrylic, oil, paper and dung
collages. Ofili's use of tiny dots was effec-
tive in providing dense colour and shape
to his subjects. His inspiration for this
came from the Matapos cave paintings
in Zimbabwe.
Chris Ofili displayed work at the con-
troversial Sensations exhibition at the
Royal Academy last year. Born in Man-
chester, he studied at the Chelsea School
of Art and the Royal College of Art. He
has now been shortlisted for the 1998
Turner Prize. In conclusion, I'd recom-
mend seeing the exhibition; It's free for
a start, and it only takes five minutes to
walk up Exhibition Road to reach the
gallery. You probably won't like it at first
but you'll end up talking about it to your
friends for ages afterwards - if only
because of those stupid elephant dung
mounds.

PHOTOGRAPHY: AN INDEPENDENT ART
Victoria and Albert Museum
T
his exhibition is an introductory
overview of the Victoria and Albert
Museum's
collection ol pho-
tographs, which
overall assembles
some iOO.OOO
works. In the cur- |
rent display (part of |
a national celebra- ;;i
tory programme), |
there are examples |
of photographic art |
ranging from the |
1850's all the way j
through to the pre- |
sent day. As would §
be expected from |
an exhibition in the
V&A, the quality of the pictures is excel-
lent. Everything, from the simple, pow-
erful black and white images like Bayer's
Metamorphosis, where the whole image
is in stark focus, to Hockney's boldly
coloured Photography's Dead Long Live
Painting, is well thought out and skillfully
asss executed. The lay-
out of the exhibi-
.:.-Q3&§§§. lion has been
•ft- ^WEiSM carefully designed,
f>/'* y f o , \vith the pho
lographs grouped
in sections accord-
ing to the tech-
nique and the age
of the print allow-
ing easy navigation
for the inexpert.
The center-
piece of this exhi-
bition is Helen
( hadwick's I hi
'X Oval Court (1986),
which earned her a nomination for the
Turner prize. This installation consists of
five gold leaf spheres placed upon blue
tinted photocopies, depicting almost
abstract images of animals and people
(perhaps a hint of product placement
and subtle advertising there, since the
company Canon
sponsors the
recently launched
gallery!). On Ihe
walls surrounding
the spheres and
oval photocopied
'pool' are weird,
weeping photos of
the artist. The
artist's creations
were referred to as
a 'post-lapsarian
Paradise where
woman is visible
alone among
humankind'. This
observation is almost as strange as the
piece itself, but the overall effect of this
piece is very strange and yet somehow
moving. Drop in and see if you can
describe it!
This exhibition is well worth a visit if
you are interested either in the history of
photography or
just in seeing pow-
erful pictures
thoughtfully cho-
sen and well dis-
played. Entrance is
free to Imperial
College students
(just show your
swipe card) and
the exhibition
shouldn't takelong
to view properly.
