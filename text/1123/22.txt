JOHN SINGER SARGENT
Tate Gallery
T
he career of John Singer Sargent
(1856 - 1925) was a blend of tri-
umphant success and titillating
scandal. As a student of the Ecole
Nationale des Beaux-Arts In Paris, his
promising debut
was marred by the
indignation sur-
rounding Madame
X (pictured left), a
daring portrait
exhibited at the
annual 1884 Salon.
The public was out-
raged at the extent
of female flesh
revealed by the
low-cut black
evening gown (by
today's standards,
the neckline is dis-
appointingly con-
servative). More
shocking still, her
slinky golden dress-
strap, casually slid-
ing down her
shoulder, was denounced as sexually
provocative (heaven forbid!). Under pres-
sure from his critics, Sargent actually
readjusted the position of the offending
strap, thus partly appeasing the fragile
sensibilities of a 19th century audience.
Although sometimes dismissed as a
cosmopolitan social-climber, the intense
public attention he received only served
to enhance his appeal amongst clients.
Appointed to the Royal Academy in 1897,
Sargent soon
became remarkably
fashionable, paint-
ing members of
the distinguished
nobility and inter-
national elite. This
collection of 150
paintings forms a
major retrospective,
later touring the
museums of Wash-
ington and Boston
(Sargent was of
American national-
ity).
In the context
of contemporary
British art, his work
was regarded as
experimental and
avant-garde. A
friend of Claude Monet, he contributed
to the introduction of Impressionism in
England, adopting similar elements of
style and brushwork technique. Yet Sar-
gent's spirit remains firmly ingrained in
the traditional and romantic.
Jaded by the demands of socialite
commissions, Sargent devoted his atten-
tion to landscapes, figure studies and
mural design projects. Then in 1918, he
was officially requested by the British
War Memorials Com-
mitee to record an
image of the Great
War for a proposed
Hall of Remem-
brance. He travelled
to the French front
and witnessed the
horrific casualties of
conflict. The result
was the impressive
Gassed, which mea-
sures over six metres
wide and usually
hangs in the Imperial
War Museum (noth-
ing to do with IC!).
The scene depicts a
crowd of blindfolded
soldiers, their eye-
sight damaged dur-
ing a mustard gas
attack. This tragic painting is an over-
whelmingly distressing image of suffer-
ing, especially powerful when contrasted
with Sargent's typical social portraits fea-
turing vivid colours, lavish costumes and
dazzling interiors.
Sargent was accused of "glossing
over social realities, sacrificing psycho-
logical depth to superficial brilliance", an
unfair reproach considering the fact that
commissioned portraits, by definition,
supposedly flatter
the sitter. How-
ever Sargent's pic-
tures are not
simply decorative;
he approaches
every subject with
subtle percep-
tion, capturing
each pose or atti-
tude with delicate
charm, confirm-
ing his unrivalled
position as the
ultimate Edwar-
dian portraitist.

PICASSO'S LADIES: JEWELLERY BY WENDY RAMSHAW
Victoria and Albert Museum
Pablo Picasso had an eye for the
ladies. Wives, mistresses and
friends have been depicted in
his paintings. The identity of his subjects
may seem inconsequential to us, but for
Picasso, each woman had an allure,
which led to the intense emotion
expressed in his work. It was this senti-
ment which drove Wendy Ramshaw to
create a collection of jewellery designed
for the women in his life. The exhibition
features 66 sets of jewellery, each one
inspired by a particular painting, which is
displayed alongside her work as a print.
Picasso's style of combining abstrac-
tion with pattern has been a useful tool
in the design of dynamic and detailed fin-
ery. In some of her pieces, Ramshaw has
imitated the colour and form of the orig-
inal paintings. The neckpiece associated
with The RockinQ Chair resembles a
rocker with the outline of a seated
woman's body. A set of large, clear beads
mimics the translucence of Standing
Woman with thin red and yellow lines
that define the painting. Other pieces of
Ramshaw's work simply develop
Picasso's theme, such as the accompa-
nying jewellery for a scene portraying a
woman at the beach drying her feet,
which is a necklace of polished pebbles.
Ramshaw is an established artist
whose early work had an aboriginal influ-
ence, and this is still apparent in this col-
lection from the shapes and designs
which she regularly employs. She chose
to work with a range of media for Ihe
project, but included only hard materials
as a reflection on the profundity of
Picasso's feeling.
Some of her pieces seem a little
over-elaborate and I had to fight against
my aversion to the Jewellery to appreci-
ate the meaning behind it. However,
other sets were very beautiful and could
be highly valued outside the boundaries
set by the exhibition. Ramshaw often
uses the materials to add expression to
Picasso's two dimensions. Sadness, for
instance, is visualised as a cascade of
tear-shaped jewels and the two rings,
describing The Kiss, were cut to form lips
with a smouldering stone set in each.
One of the most striking pieces of
the exhibition was a set of two virtually
identical rings, one set with moonstones
and the other left as empty gold sur-
rounds. This was associated with the Por-
trait ofOlga, whose head and shoulders
were painted in soft pastel shades
whereas her crossed arms were left as a
pencil sketch.
tven the stands for the rings and
combs are carefully handcrafted,
although in some cases I found myself
admiring these more than the actual
exhibits! Yet this meticulous attention to
detail characterises Ramshaw's wish to
do Picasso justice. For one of the final
pieces of the collection, Ramshaw has
chosen Women Ironing. Picasso's sym-
pathy for the subject is shown In the neu-
tral tones and the weary female face,
revealing the tedium of her labour. In a
similarly generous gesture, Ramshaw
offers her a string of glittering jewels in
gold. The question is, if Picasso were
alive today, would he present these gifts •
to his treasured ladies?
