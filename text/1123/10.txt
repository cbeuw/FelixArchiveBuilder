The Church of Scientology
After deciding to buy a VCR machine, I
thought Tottenham Court Road would be
the most suitable place to get the best
deal. As I wandered along, I noticed that
nestled between the electrical stores
was an 'outlet' of the Church of Scien-
tology.
Having been aware of the organi-
sation for many years, and being rather
inquisitive, I sheepishly entered. I simply
wanted to find out what was on offer,
what was different about them and what
their agenda was. After all, the organi-
sation boasts such members as John Tra-
volta and Tom Cruise.
The 'outlet' resembled a cafe in
some respects. Practically as soon as I
walked in I was invited to take a per-
sonality test, which I duly did. I ticked
upwards of about sixty boxes designed
to delve into my innermost psyche. I
was then interviewed about the results,
which seemed to indicate a certain lack
of personality. This is the complete
antithesis to what people, including
myself, would say, although I am an IC
student. Admittedly I didn't fill out the
form as carefully as I might. However I
did notice that many of the questions
were repeated in
slightly different
guises - for what pur-
pose I am not quite
sure.
My interviewer
tried to wrench as
much sensitive infor-
mation out of me as
possible; I retorted
with whatever
entered my head at
the time. She thought
that a process called
auditing would be to
my benefit. Apparently this auditing is
rather like psychotherapy, but the subject
is connected to an 'E-meter' which is
supposed to point out problematic points
in the life of those being audited, for all
I know they were using it to determine
...human problems
stem from "lingering
spirits of an extrater-
restrial people massa-
cred by their ruler,
Xenu, over 75 million
years ago."
my financial status.
We continued conversing for around
thirty minutes while the interviewer
attempted to gain more and more infor-
mation. She was
extremely keen to
find out my darkest
secrets and, when I
would not divulge
them, became
increasingly persua-
sive. Tired of the prob-
ing questions, I asked
about the organisa-
tion, its beliefs, its
founder and its basis.
I was given a whirl-
wind description of
the Church - so brief
that I knew little more afterwards than
when I walked in the door. Apparently
Scientologists believe that all human
problems stem from "lingering spirits of
an extraterrestrial people massacred by
their ruler, Xenu, over 75 million years
ago." These spirits attach themselves by
"clusters" to individuals in the contem-
porary world, causing spiritual harm and
negatively influencing the lives of their
hosts,- it makes me look at flu in a com-
pletely different way.
I was then invited to buy some
leaflets at a cost of Â£4 each. I declined,
explaining that I was a poor student,
whilst hiding my mobile phone. I
explained that I hadn't bought my VCR
yet, but promised to return... I beat a
hasty retreat to Dixons to buy that Aiwa
Video machine.
