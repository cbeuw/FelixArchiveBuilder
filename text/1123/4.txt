Deputy
Deficiency
by Andrew Ofori
The air of enthusiasm that inspires the
Union at the outset of any new year is
being severely tempered by a Sabbatical
shortage. In keeping with previous years,
the position of Deputy President for
Clubs & Societies has been left vacant,
increasing the workload of Union offi-
cials. Fate rather than apathy was the cul-
prit in the case of this year's staff
shortage, with the former DP(C&S) elect
failing last year, forcing him to withdraw
from the position.
The elected DPIC&S) will be respon-
sible for the 200 Clubs & Societies, rep-
resenting them to the College and
external organisations such as BUSA
(British Universities Sports Association).
The new incumbent will be an essential
point of contact to club members and
can expect to invest their creativity in the
expansive field of Student Development
until yet another Sabbatical is elected to
focus on Welfare and Education.
The missing Sabbatical's duties are
currently shared between Union offi-
cials; when relevant issues arise, it is the
Union President and the DP(finance &
Services) who arc making the decisions,
any requisite action is facilitated by the
Clubs & Societies Administrator. This cur-
rent method of operation was described
as a 'bit of a nightmare' by the Union
President, although he did commend
the Administrator's dedication.
He felt the current lack of candi-
dates emanated from student's reluc-
tance to split their courses with a
Sabbatical year, but with recurring issues
such as health & safety and hybrid entry
awaiting a rational mind he pleaded 'As
long as you're not a complete donkey
please stand!1
.
The Union's drive to find a Deputy
President is an effort to avoid their worst
fears, a round of elections where
DP(C&S) candidates are required for this
year and next. Each candidate requires
a proposer and 20 seconders; papers
came down on Friday with 2 potential
candidates standing, namely Rostam Kil-
gour from Physics and Material's Stuart
Cook. Today marks the beginning of 2
weeks of campaigning around the col-
lege and this will be followed by voting
from 9.00-5.00pm on the 9th &10th
November where every Union member
has the opportunity to vote.

fears of low turnout and heavy losses
also surround the Medical Freshers Ball,
which was scheduled to take place last
Saturday (after Felix went to press).
The Medics Graduation Ball had
been organised by the School of Medi-
cine Rugby squad, on the understanding
that any profits would be diverted into
their coffers. However, their decision to
book a hotel for the event was made
without any consultation of either the
Union President or Deputy President,
and without following correct Union
financial procedures. As a result, a con-
tract was signed which requires the
Union to pay 100% of the bill, even if a
decision is made to cancel the event.
Similarly, the Freshers Ball was organ-
ised by the Med School Union without
consultation with ICU. the contract was
finally seen by Deputy President Chris
Ince less than a week before the event,
and with a verbal agreement already
made, he thus he had no choice but to
sign. This left the Med School Union
needing to sell 504 tickets for the event
to break even - leaving the prospect of
greater losses looming large.
This financial laxity is widely regarded
as being a direct consequence of the
huge scale of the combined Med School
Union reserves (built up over a period of
many years by donations and profits
from events) - which stood at £55 885 at
the beginning of August, and may not be
touched by ICU for the next twelve
months. However, at the end of that
period they will be pared down to a
level comparable with the other Con-
stituent College Union's (approximately
£2000). Thus, certain leading figures in
ICSM SU have decided that the next
twelve months should be treated as a
gigantic spending spree, with the words
"Take that out of our reserves" frequently
echoing around Union offices. In excess
of ten thousand pounds has already
been spent, and the losses accrued by
these events could see the reserves
plummet furthet.
If no action is taken by ICU, then the
next year could see an unprecedented
roller coaster of spending on behalf of
medical students which could easily see
their reserves reduced from five figures
to four or even three.

two men were on the campaign trail for
a YES vote in the Northern Ireland refer-

ment.
On Friday 16th October the same pair,
John Hume MP and David Trimble MP,
were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize "...
for their efforts to find a peaceful solu-
tion to the conflict in Northern Ireland."
As somebody who grew up living a mere
fifteen miles from John Hume's native
Derry, I am delighted that his endless
dedication to peace has been recog-
nised, even if his ultimate aim has not
been altogether achieved. For as long as
I have been reading newspapers, there
has hardly been a day when I opened the

work Hume has done for his home city
or for the nationalists of Northern Ireland.
John Hume has always been a peaceful
man and was instrumental in bringing
about the IRA ceasefire in 1994 through
secret talks with Gerry Adams. The fact
that Adams is no longer regarded with
the same offence, he

Hume has tirelessly

Northern Ireland's
Catholics and National-
ists since the Civil Rights movement
started 30 years ago. It is hoped this
award will not be an end in itself, but
rather John I lume will be truly rewarded
with peace in our country.
I see David Trimble as another matter
entirely, from an early age I can quite
honestly say that a certain lan Paisely
helped me form an opinion that all
Unionist politicians are the same, i.e.
Ihey were only interested in NO politics.
To be fair though for many years my
only recollections of some towns having
visited them, was the size of their "Ulster
says NO" banner draped across their
respective town halls.
When Trimble became
the Ulster Unionist
Party leader I feared
the worst; more of the
same. Thankfully to
some extent I have
been proved wrong.
That is, Trimble backed
the 1974 loyalist work-
ers strike, was opposed to the Anglo-Irish
Agreement and marched triumphantly
through Portadown, hand-in-hand with
lan Paisely, after the first Dumcree inci-
dent in 1995.
I was not only shocked but overjoyed

(over half of his party's MPs
were opposed to the Good Hume

ble had so much to lose if he failed to get
the overall backing from his party he
deserved. I will always remember his
courage throughout the referendum
campaign, and I'm sure many people
with similar views to myself felt the same.
Like Gerry Adams said, "...this is a man I
could do business with", he too is a
deserving winner of this award.
Despite the criticisms from some quarters
directed towards the Nobel Committee
on their choice, I feel it is not an award
to kick-start a failing peace process, but
merely endorses what has gone on and
hopefully will continue until such time
that every member of Northern Ireland's
community can walk, drink, eat and shop
with no fear of violence.
