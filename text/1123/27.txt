2nd XI
IC 3 - 0 QMW
This was IC's second BUSA game, fol-
lowing our 5-3 win the previous week.
IC got off to a good start with early
pressure on the opposition. It paid off
when a shot from just outside the 18-
yard box from Loz, managed to get past
the keeper. IC continued to have most
of the play during the first half, without
too many attempts on goal. About 10
minutes before half time IC won a cor-
ner, which was played into the penalty
area and in clearing the ball, one of
QMW's handled the ball. Jules, our cap-
tain, stepped up and put the penalty
away.
The rest of the first half passed with-
put incident. After the break, IC con-
tinued where they had left off, taking
most of the possesion, but not having
many shots on goal. It wasn't until
about the 70th minute that IC scored
their third goal. From the corner Tony
got to the ball first and put in a great
goal. IC dominated the rest of the
match and had a few long-range efforts
but, again, did not really test the keeper.
QMW did not really have a chance on
goal in the second half. The closest they
came was a good fre kick halfway
through the first half. It was a good per-
formance, giving IC something to build
on for the coming weeks.
4th XI
IC 7 - 0 LSE
Playing the same team twice at the start
of the season is never ideal, tven
if you win the first game the usual apa-
thy associated with all IC can set in,
resulting in a below par performance in
the second game, and losing the
first game just tends to demoralise you.
However it was quite different in
these two games. Losing the BUSA game
merely strengthened our resolve to over-
power the same LSE team three days
later in the ULU League.
In BUSA we were actually leading 2-
0 at half time, thus to lose from such a
position was extremely galling (perhaps
something to do with the apathy?).
The three goals we conceded in the
second half came about from sharp
incisive forward power play from the
Economists, lacklustre defending from
the Imperialists and, to be honest, shite
goal-keeping from the Custodian.
Credit has to be given to the whole
team who apart from the obvious lapses
in concentration played some neat foot-
ball more recognisant of the silky
skills of Bury LC than the previous tirade
of long balls served up by previous
Fourth teams, tor the record the quality
goals were scored by Adam
and John.
Then, strengthened by a couple of
new players for the Saturday game IC
simply dominated from start to finish.
Against the wind in the first half it was
always going to be tough, but LSE only
managed one shot on target, saved su
perbly by S-T-U, the prospective candi-
date for DP (C&S). Some remarked that
it was possibly his best save in his five
years at IC; though the previous two
saves weren't really up to that much
anyway. Some inspired (???) substitu-
tions at half time enabled the Famous
Footballing fourths to cruise to a famous
victory, reaffirming themselves to be the
best Fourths in London. Peyrouz scored,
Adam scored a couple, Bertie a hat trick
and Chris a wonder goal. It all bodes well
for the future...altogether now

Badminton
Delusions of Grandeur
This summer has seen much change in
the college buildings as part of the con-
tinual renaissance of the campus, none
more so than the refurbished Great Hall.
Unfortunately it was discovered that the
contractors had laid the wrong kind of
surface for badminton. This means a
special carpet/synthetic surface has to be
laid each time it is required for play and
even this has not proved satisfactory to
the purists of the game. All this despite
the fact that the Union had been estab-
lished as one of the key members of the
User Group in meetings prior to the
building work approaching the end of
last term.
The other more contentious issue
arising from the redevelopment is the
accessibility the Union now has to the
Great Hall. Owing to the work done on
it, the Great Hall now boasts retractable
seats. This is not the instantaneous high
technology as suggested by its descrip-
tion. For instance, if the badminton club
wanted to use the hall, a "specially
trained" crew of four staff would need
to spend five hours to take away the
seats and prepare the floor. As this costs
Â£200 a go there is still debate as to who
pays, the Conference Office or the
Union. This also has wider ramifications
for other Union activities represented at
the great hall such as the "East meets
West" show for one prominent example.
ICU president, Dave Hcllard con-
ceded that this oversight "was nothing
malicious" but declared that because
the Union was not culpable for this error
it should not have to be burdened with
the associated costs. However, some of
the more cynical old hacks would say
that a change of guard at the Union
helm had given the Estates Office the
ideal opportunity to take advantage and
possibly expunge Union interest from
the Sherfield building.

D'Oh!
No women's
X-Country team
Even by Imperal's standards the turnout
for the women's team at the ULU X-
country meet at Parliament Hill was, to
say the least, abysmal. Bethan battled
bravely for 2nd place but refused to run
3 more laps to make up a team.
The men faired slightly better with
3 full teams demonstrating strength and
depth, if not speed. Brunei used their
usual dirty tactics to break up the field,
leaving Benny-boy to finish gallantly in
8th position.
There were excellent performances
from Mike Baicher and Gavin Daisley,
who qualified for the first team on their
debuts. Nick "Kinky" Bowmen decided
to run anyway, dispite astmha and 'flu.
The rest of the boys did well, especially
the first timers on the X-country scene.
Thanks to everyone who ran and PLEASE
could we have some more female run-
ners!

RSM 2nd XI
ICV11 - 7 RSM
Oh RSM [Oh RSM]
Arc wonderful [Are wonderful I
Oh RSM are wondcfull!
RSM didn't play badly as a team (as the
scoreline suggests), but the encourag-
ing thing was that they created enough
chances to be well into double figures
if certain members of the team (myself
included!) kept their compsure. I'm
sure that'll come with time. Goals came
from "Captian" Dave, "Vice" Moony,
"Twinkle-toes" Tim, "Devious" Derek, a
double strike from "Pieman" Phil and
none other than Barry McGuigan him-
self, who struck a knockout blow by
sweetly sweeping a right hook into the
mouth of the goal.
We can't get too big-headed, but
we're at the top of the table after just
one game and we agreed in the chang-
ing room afterwards that it would be too
much effort to move from the top spot.
So, Mines, let's dig deep and, save any
pitfalls, show 'em what we're capable
of. Oh RSM are wonderful! Mark
Hockey
IC I 6 - 0 QMW
Big Titties provided the opening excite-
ment by denying an old ally, 2.4 inches,
a goal. He then proceeded to venture
into the opposition s half as much as
possible. Annoyed at being denied
one goal, he had another poached by
Noddy. Not bad for a fat, lazy left back.
A spawny goal by spag.bol meant that
it was 2-0 at half time. After half time it
was a joke, IC's sweeper almost scoring.
QMW were poor, IC ruled. An excellent
start to a promising season.
Unknown IC 3rds 7-0 ICSM
ICSM were crap and we whipped them
7-0. Before the game we were unsure
of the apptitutde but after 10 minutes
and 3 goals, we realised we were onto
a winner. Casanova led from the front
with a hat-trick from Casnanova. In the
2nd half he only scored once - I
thought he scored "all the time".
(Some of you (me, for example) may be
wondering about what sport this team
actually plays. Scrawling a mostly ilegi-
blei'unprintable match report and end-
ing it with the words "helix is shit" is NOI
the best way to get your team's efforts
into these pages. But I've got space to
fill - Gus)
