Thought for the Day
Halloween
T
his may be the first Halloween on
which you get children coming to
your door and asking for Mars
bars before stealing your trousers. Well,
that's what they do where I come from,
anyway. As far as I am concerned, the
scariest imaginable event on October
31 is a load of drunk 12-year olds arriving
"...Jhe-
deviiish dirrking

on your doorstep and clamouring to be
fed chocolate (just for that sugar-rush). If
they are refused, they will disappear,
returning, as if by magic, at the witching
hour; the devilish clinking of Zippo
lighters will alert you to the fact that your
bins are on fire. Oh yes, the real zombies
walk amongst us every day.
This scenario, let's face it, is far more
disturbing than even the best pumpkin
lanterns. As Steve Punt once put it: "It's
a large root vegetable with a candle in it.
New underpants for me, Mum."
Halloween is a cor-
ruption of All Hallows' Eve,
the day before the Christ-
ian festival of All Saints'
Day. The traditions of Hal-
loween are believed to
have been inherited from
the Druids. Both the Celts
and the Druids considered
this day to be of spiritual
significance; the Celts
placed Halloween at the
end of their year. Finally,
the Romans introduced
the features of one of their
harvest festivals into Hal-
loween when they were
on their world tour in 55
BC.
This still does not answer
the question: why do
mothers let their kids jaunt
merrily round the dark-
ened neighbourhood, wearing provoca-
tive elf costumes, and requesting
sweeties? Was that the Romans' idea, or

haaaah!
a drug-induced Druidicism?
While we're on the subject of
witches and drugs together, I must draw
your attention to a memo-
rable scries which was
shown over the summer
on Channel 4. The scries
was entitled Sacred Weeds,
and showed the investiga-
tion of a group of scien-
tists, anthropologists and
" - ;:-,.< ,'ijr nil !\|.(», I!'",
• ing volunteers with legal
drugs and then observing
the effects. Henbane was
one drug administered in
these tests, which some
believe was used by the
witches found commonly
in folklore. If this scries is
repeated, I strongly sug-
gest you watch at least the
first programme; it will be
worth it just to see one vol-
unteer climbing a tree to
potentially fatal heights,
while high as a kite on fly agaric mush-
rooms, as the scientists calmly take notes.
We can thus sec how the media
thrives on Halloween, of course; any
excuse for a bit of seasonal variation is
gladly accepted [and accepted especially
by me]. It's still a fun idea, but I think chil-
dren these days are far more interested
in the perversely explosive thrills of 5
November than in bobbing apples. The
horror film industry loves this day like no

other; but that, as wc all know, is a well-
worn, hackneyed, and generally low-
quality route.
Halloween, then. Be it wizard, or be
it wash-out? Like so many of the plea-
sures of childhood, the appeal vanishes
as you get older. Plus forgetting to buy
Mars bars will probably trip me up.

here arc some who might say
that Sherfield is the last bastion of
the empire, and filled with people
who want nothing less than complete
world domination. I really do not know
the personalities in Sherfield well enough
to decide whether they are suffering
from megalomaniacal delusions of
grandeur or whether they just want to
make the world a better place. How-
ever, I do feel that if the attitude they like
to project concerning their approach to
undergraduates and general student
facilities is accurate then pity the poor
fools who allow themselves to be swal-
lowed up by the Sherfield behemoth.
This side of IC has been revealed to
me in several ways, culminating in the
meeting in Gladys' where the medics
were receiving Instruction in the financial
regulations governing ICU. The exact
details of the controversy are not espe-
cially relevant but the meeting did high-
light certain beliefs held by Sherfield that
are worrying because of their implica-
tions for the student body.
Imperial College is prepared to
spend £125 000 000 (please note the
number of noughts) on a building on
which they had agreed to spend £60
000 000. I wish I knew their bank man-
ager. On top of this, Sherfield is going to
spend an estimated £110 000 on a few
flowers to make the building look pretty.
Again, I ask, where do they bank and can
1 open an account there? Thinking about
it a little further, I don't want an account
with a bank that allows its customers to
overspend to the tune of £65 000 000 but
rather I would like a job working for the
company that managed to get Sherfield
to cough up that sort of cash. Maybe ICU
should try to head hunt them for the
position of DP C&S?
The previous paragraph was just a
prelude to explaining about the problem
of the lack of transport that ICU is able
to provide to its members because IC
does not give them enough money. IC
is happy to bask in the reflected glory of
IC medics winning the rugby UH cup
and of IC cricket winning the UL cham-
pionship but are they going lo lift a fin-
ger or allocate one penny of funds to
enable these achievements to happen?
IC seem to have no conception of the
fact that if you ally yourself (I'll never be
merged) with such a widespread campus
network then your students arc neces-
sarily going to spread out, as are the
facilities. Perhaps this is another part of
their plot to kill the will and spirit of the
students so that they can cut ICU's bud-
get even further.
What these developments mean is
that the issue of student politics is no
longer about personal ambition, CV
points or argumentativeness. It is about
whether you as an individual want to play
rugby, hockey or football, whether you
want to go sailing or SCUBA diving or fly-
ing or just sit and watch a new-release
movie with the cinema club. All these
activities, indeed just about everything
that you as students do are funded to
some extent by a body of policy makers
who treat you as a loss leader and who
could not really care less about you. In
the long run, so long as we do nothing
to interrupt the flow of research money
that floods into the IC coffers, Sherfield
will do the bare minimum to keep us
happy while relying on their reputation
for academic excellence to keep recruit-
ing. Unfortunately this is unlikely to
change anytime soon because IC seems
to have found an unending supply of stu-
dents who do have and do not appear
to want a life outside of their work. I only
hope that the medics do not get cor-
rupted by this attitude because medi-
cine is hard enough without losing a
social life as well.
