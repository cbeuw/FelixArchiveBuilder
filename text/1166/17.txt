count us as worthy of his goodness.
If he only permitted good to
exist, by destroying evil, then we
would have no choice. But we have
a choice, we are not governed by
fate. It is this choice that makes us
free to be who we are, to take the
good option or the bad option, even
to ask the questions and take the
view that Mr. Vivian does.
If we do accept his gift of love,
we can come to know him personal-
ly. This is the purpose of religion, not
to give us some nefarious 'hope' or
'purpose', that thinks might be nicer
later on, as Mr. Vivian seems to
think, but that we might know G o d .
In knowing that he has given us a
way to come to him through Jesus
Christ, and his role in creating and
preserving us, then we should, and
can, be spending our time praying to
him and thanking him. He is not
someone who we should ignore, or
ultimately can ignore.
Mr. Vivian is right when he says
that Religion is waning, but this is not
because G o d is any less important
today than he was many years, or
that our ancestors were more credu-
lous than we are, but because socie-
ty is choosing to ignore G o d , and
the ways we have to understand him,
and the things we know about him.
His article is surely a reflection of that
fact.

Dear Felix,
Congratulations to Andy Vine for
his article on religion (Scythe, 31
January). It's surprising that so many
supposedly fine minds throughout
the history of civilisation have spent
so long debating the existence of
God, the problem of evil and the
nature of free will, when all it takes to
sort the whole thing out is one sci-
ence undergrad with a page to fill
before Star Trek.
Obviously anyone with a faith in
this day and age is scientifically illit-
erate. Imperial should reconsider its
admissions policy - at present we
must be awarding degrees to sever-
al hundred of these halfwits a year!
I look forward to reading a the-
ologist's opinion of the chemical
composition of interstellar dust
clouds in next week's issue.
Yours,
A Christian
SUMMER BALL UPDATE
Dear Dave,
Just a quick note to let you (and
everybody else!) know that this year's
Imperial College Summer Ball will
take place on SATURDAY 1 7th JUNE
2000, at the Alexandra Palace (don't
worry, it's not the hall we used last
year!); it's going to cost you £50,
and it's going to be a night never to
be forgotten. Guest speaker is going
to be Trevor Phillips (ICU President
19781), who by that point may well
be Deputy Mayor of London. There
are only limited numbers of tickets
available, so come on folks! To show
your interest, please e-mail sum-
mer.ball@ic.ac.uk and book your
place for the event of the Millennium
(oh bugger, referred to the millenni-
um, sorry!)
Cheers,
The Summer Ball Team
BLATANT PLUG
Dear Sir,
At the end of Autumn term,
members of the Conservative and
Labour societies met for the purpos-
es of an organised debate, we felt
that the College was missing out in
the absence of a debating society
and resolved to go some way
towards doing something about it.
Despite the effective absence of any
advertising, the event, a debate on
the privatisation of the London
Underground, was considered suffi-
ciently successful to warrant repeat-
ing. Our next meeting will cover the
predictable yet pressing issue of
Britain's possible entry into the Euro-
pean single currency. This will take
place in the union Dining Hall at
1:00 on Thursday, February 10. The
debate is free to enter, and there will
be no obligation to join either of the
societies.
Please contact us
(alun.hart@ic.ac.uk or patrick.hayes
@ic.ac.uk) if you wish to speak, sug-
gest a topic for future debate or wish
to put your name on a debating
mailing list. We look forward to see-
ing you.
Yours faithfully
Alun Hart (Conservative Soc)
Paddy Hayes (Labour Soc)

I'm fully prepared to accept that
Union elections aren't the most
exciting thing on the planet. Being
accosted by random strangers on
the Walkway, finding every surface
covered by a wall of inane posters
(when you're already five minutes
late for a lecture), or being forced
to wade; through a mountain of
election gumpf every time you turn
around, is hardly my idea of fun.
Hell, I was a willing participant in
the whole process this time Inst
year, and it bored the hell out of
me.... Sadly, however, this intensely
boring spectacle is actually a really
important part of the year. The five
grinning idiots that we finally get
around to electing will represent
our views and interests to our
departments, our wardens, our fin-
anciers and our government. They
will be in regular contact with the
people who control our daily lives
and, once in a while, they will actu-
ally have the chance to affect the
decisions that the College makes.
So, much as you may not want
to, I'm afraid you're going to have
to take an interest in the forthcom-
ing elections. By the time this edi-
tion reaches your hands, a dozen
or so gallant / foolhardy / manipu-
lative / stupid individuals will have
put their names forward, and will
have begun their campaigns (I sus-
pect that the wall-to-wall posters
will probably have given this away).
However, with at least five or six
options to chose from for some of
the posts (ie President), how do you
pick your preferred option? Well,
firstly there are the candidates
manifestoes, which will (hopefully)
appear in Felix this time next week.
Some may suggest a solid back-
ground of responsibility and Union
posts. Although these are useful (it
certainly helps to know about the
way the Union and the College are
run before you start the job) they're
certainly not the be all and end all
when it comes to selecting the best
person for the job. Similarly, whilst
a solid set of polices and goals is
admirable, there's a fine line-
between pointless idealism and
monotonous pessimism, for exam-
ple, I expect.that all the candidates
for the top job will speak of trying
to improve communication (what-
ever that really means), and make
the Union more accessible but
whilst that sounds very nice, it's
hardly a concrete objective for the
year. Try to see through the man-
agement double-speak and inane
waffle, and work out if they intend
to do anything during the year (or
whether they're just after some C V
points). Which, of course, never
happens. O h no.
The second means of contact
is through hustings. By asking the
candidates the questions you want
an answer to, you can not only find
out their views on all the key topics
(and all the silly ones too), but it's
also your only chance to find out
what the candidates are like under
pressure. Do they go to pieces, or
do they stroll through tough ques-
tioning and hostile audiences (hus-
tings at St Mary's are traditionally a
great test of this';? After all, it's
incredibly important that your
prospective sabbaticals have the
ability to stand up for themselves
and stick to their guns (whilst
remaining calm and presentable)
when faced with hostility - they'll
face that on a weekly basis at Col-
lege meetings.
Finally, there are the more
ethereal aspects. All those posters
might not tell you very much about
policies or ideals, but they'll prob-
ably give you an insight into the
candidates sense of humour and
personality (and if they're promis-
ing to improve communication,
this'll probably give you a pointer
to their chances of success). The
most decisive factor, however, is
probably word of mouth. Ultimate-
ly, you're looking for a group of
decent people who can get along
with each other, so reputation and
image is everything. Somewhere
along the line, someone you know
probably knows each and every
one of the candidates a little, so try
and get their opinions - don't auto-
matically vote like sheep, but don't
discount the possibility that some of
the candidates are, in fact, com-
plete idiots. It has been known to
happen.
