GARETH M O R G A N
John Quelch, Dean of the London
Business School, is Britain's high-
est-earning academic, with a
salary of £252 0 0 0 in the last
academic year. This is more than
double the national average, and
over £ 1 0 0 0 0 0 more than the
second-placed vice-chancellor, Sir
Stuart Sutherland of Edinburgh
University, according to a league
table published in last week's
Times Higher Education Supple-
ment.
Vice-chancellors pay rises last
year averaged 4.9%, considerably
higher than the 3.5% awarded to
academic staff. Lecturers unions
criticised the increases in the light
of last year's academic staff
protests over pay. Many vice-
chancellors, including Professor
Quelch, received larger pay rises.
The London Business School
employs two other members of
academic staff who are paid more
than £200 000 per year, but Pro-
fessor Quelch justified their pay as
being "In line with the School's
ranking as the best business
school in Europe", according to
the Financial Times. Fees for the
Master of Business Administration
(MBA) course at the School are
£15 5 4 0 per year for a two year
course. Imperial College's M a n -
agement School came second in
the table.
Lord Oxburgh, Rector of Impe-
rial College, earned a compara-
tively meagre £107 000, slightly
above the national average of
£104 000. He only took a small
pay rise, however, and this figure
does not take into account his res-
idence at 170 Queen's Gate.
Imperial does have 6 7 members
of staff earning above £100 000
per annum however - more than
any other institution. Sir Richard
Sykes, head of GlaxoWellcome
and tipped to become the next
Rector, earned £ 3 . 6 million last
year, and is set to do "Quite well"
from share options after Glaxo's
merger with SmithKline Beecham.
He is currently earning the equiva-
lent of Lord Oxburgh's salary every
eleven days.
In B r i e f
IS IT C O L D THIS
M O R N I N G ?
If your Monday morning lectures
are unusually cold, it could be due
to the College's heating system
being turned off last week. The
steam supply was turned off last
Friday, and should have been back
on (courtesy of the new Combined
Heating and Power Plant) on Sun-
day night.
P O R T A L O O RETURNS
A surprise reshuffle in the shadow
cabinet saw ex-treasury minister
Michael Portillo move into the
position of Shadow Chancellor of
the Exchequer. M r Portillo, newly
elected M P for Kensington and
Chelsea (following the death of
Alan Clark) returns to the front
bench to directly challenge Gor-
don Brown; this follows his embar-
rassing defeat in the 1 997 general
elections at the hands of Labour
MP Stephen Twigg.
Mr Portillo, 4 6 , replaces Fran-
cis Maude, who has moved into
the role of Shadow Foreign Secre-
tary. M r Maude was openly criti-
cised for what was perceived as his
inability to challenge Gordon
Brown on key issues. With the
economy in good shape and no
sign of the slump and recession
predicted following the collapse of
markets across South-East Asia,
the general feeling is that the
famously right-wing Eurosceptic Mr
Portillo will have a job on his
hands. Talking to the BBC, he said
he would battle for a "lower bur-
den of tax" and "less interference
in business" and proceeded to
immediately launch a scathing
attack on the Labour Party's sup-
port for the "spectacularly badly
performing" Euro, warning of the
"economic difficulties" inherent in
maintaining one exchange rate for
the whole of Europe.

C O T DEATH
New research has indicated that
babies who are exposed to ciga-
rette smoke have a massively
increased risk of Sudden Infant
Death Syndrome (SIDS, or cot
death). The study found that for
every hour a baby spends in a
smoke-filled room, the risk of cot
death doubles. Six out of ten cases
of SIDS could be prevented,
according to the authors.

HOTTER T H A N HELL
American scientists have isolated a
compound, denatonium capsi-
conate, which is one hundred
times hotter than the hottest chilli.
Detectable at concentrations of
one part in ten million, the burning
sensation caused by tasting it can
last up to half an hour. It is intend-
ed to be used to stop mice gnaw-
ing through electric cables.
