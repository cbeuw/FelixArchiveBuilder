Ladies Football
IC I 9
University of Buckingham 2
What a surprise. Yet again the IC
ladies storm through another
match. The opposition were
chunky, but we were funky. Well
funky in fact. The day was action
packed with excitement. After
spending most of the morning
chasing Chelsea players to sign our
match ball, we were slightly disap-
pointed when the names rubbed off
after 9 0 minutes of thwacking.
Another topic open to discussion
was the ref. Upon scouring all the
local nursing homes for a suitable
candidate, captain Helga decided
upon the most senile, blind, deaf,
and most likely to have a coronary
OAR
As for the match, the IC ladies
played with the kind of superior
style that has been becoming a
habit lately. The forwards had a
field day, with goal scoring domi-
nance taking effect from kick-off.
Clark Kent's double hat-trick left
the opposition reeling with humili-
ation, while the electric feeling of
adrenaline running through every
vessel in Kent's body was felt by
the rest of the team. Tina "I'll-
d rink-you-under-the-table-and-
then-leg-it" followed suit with
another hat-trick that sealed victo-
ry for a deserving IC team.
The opposition's attempts at
retaliation were tres poor. They
somehow managed to score two
goals due to the referee bestowing
extreme generosity on a losing
team, courtesy of his own blatant
short-sightedness. And all this
despite lineswoman extraordinary
Nona's frantic yelling and waving
of the flag. The self-same blind ref
created a slightly panicky moment
for Hacker Harp, by beckoning her
with dodgy finger movements for a
completely above board (not)
tackle. But luckily things didn't go
the Beckham way.
In a recent interview, the IC
ladies declared that they relished
the winning feeling. It is definitely
becoming a habit, having pasted
GKT 13-0 on the previous Sunday.
The future looks bright, and defi-
nitely embedded with silverware.

Ski Club - Huskies Race Series
Race 2 - Wycombe Summit
Sunday 29th January 2 0 0 0
After a frantic ring around, even-
tually enough people had assem-
bled in Southside to pass for a
team, so we started off for High
Wycombe. O n arrival we signed
in and picked up our ski's. Ventur-
ing out onto the slope for a cou-
ple of practice runs, we were
relieved to find that the slope was
in far better condition than we
usually find it on a Wednesday
afternoon, with all the sprinklers
on full blast. Soon the course was
set up and we started the long
wait for our numbers to be called.
Even with one run taking the
fastest skiers a tad under twenty
seconds, we were numbers 8 6 -
89, so we were faced with a con-
siderable wait up at the top of
Wycombe Summit - exposed to
the wind, things (as usual) got
quite cold.
Eventually our numbers were
called, and Rosey made his way to
the start gate. After putting in a
reasonable run on a very varied
course, he was followed by Bywa-
ter, Pete Holt and finally club cap-
tain Sarah Hughes. Sarah man-
aged to get her own back on
Rosey, after he beat her in the pre-
vious race in the series. This was
followed by another immense wait
for the second run. While waiting
- this time inside in the bar - we
noticed that a large number of the
very best skiers were just trying to
go too fast, and many were crash-
ing out. After the second run, in
which everyone managed to put
in a quicker time, we were halfway
up the lift, when we heard the
unexpected announcement,
'Imperial are currently leading the
team event' We realised that this
must have been because we had
been the first team to get every-
one down both runs so far. There
was only one team yet to go who
could beat us - UCL. As our team
was slightly too small (we should
have had five skiers) if U C L could
get the whole team down, no mat-
ter if they were slower than us,
they would have it. Sure enough,
they all made it down intact. We
only had the dual slalom to g o ,
hardly one of our team's strong
points - even with a ringer from
UCL. We were knocked out in the
first round (obviously our notori-
ous false starts - a legacy from
last years president - weren't quite
audacious enough). All in all a
successful evening's skiing -
hopefully next time Marcus will
turn up to ski, and even bring the
pads.
