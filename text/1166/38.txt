W o m e n lose the match but not their pride
Volleyball
Bad news has finally arrived, with the
first defeat of the season for the
women's volleyball team. This hap-
pened against Kent University, a very
strong team with their own profes-
sional coaching staff providing the
team with all their needs, excellent
sports facilities on their campus, and
a top quality record in BUSA.
Unfortunately, since we were
now at the BUSA knock-out stages,
the 3-1 defeat means the end of the
season for us which, by recognition
of our opponents, is pretty unfair for
such a good team. Nevertheless, this
was the best season ever for our
team and you can be sure that the
girls made IC proud.
Imperial started better, much
better. As their coach admitted at the
end of the match, they had no idea
IC's women were this good. So, we
took them by surprise and won the
first set by 25-23, thanks to some
brilliant serving and top-quality
game distribution from our setters,
Magali and Szun Szun. It was mag-
nificent!
In the second set, things got
harder, Kent made some readjust-
ments, we missed some easy balls
and that was enough to make the
difference. Kent got it by 25-19. But
still, things were pretty close and our
players were definitely impressing
everybody watching. Magali and
Szun Szun were setting brilliantly,
Sandrine and MariJo were blocking
everything thrown at them, Lucia and
Rapha were attacking the serve like
mad, and super-subs Anisah and
Ivonne were backing up the defence
superbly! So, things were looking
good at this stage.
Then, the horror set came inl
Their professional coach cleverly
spotted our weak points in the net
and gave instruction to their two very
good American spikers to attack
through those points (something our
London opponents were never able
to do). And there was nothing we
could do! They just kept on hammer-
ing us, one ball after the other, and
at one stage we were 23-11 behind!
This was definitely the only set where
Kent were clearly the better team.
Finally, in the fourth set, we
made some readjustments to the
team to tackle those weak points that
cost us dearly in the previous one,
and things really got much more bal-
anced. At the start, we lost four
points in a row, since the players that
came in were not used to playing in
those positions, but then we levelled
things out and reached a 22-22
position. At this point everybody was
close to a nervous breakdown. You
could feel the tension in the air. Kent
was surprised to see us managing to
change our tactics completely and
getting back into the game (they
congratulated us in the end for that).
Unfortunately, our lack of experience
at the highest level did not help us at
this stage, and we let them clinch the
set 25-22, and as a result they took
the match.
It was sad, very sad indeed. We
could have got that fourth set and
then beaten them at the last one. But
that wasn't to be. Kent were stronger
on the day. However, the perform-
ance of the team put Imperial
women's on the map! As Kent's staff
told us in the end, we could have
easily gone through to the national
with such a fantastic team. But we
were unlucky with the draw and
came up against a strong Kent side.
Now, we learn from here and try to
do it better next year!
To finish, I would just like to
thank to thank all those who came to
play and support (especially
Gabriela and Beat), to the brilliant
team captain, Sandrine, and to our
opponents who organised a meal for
us at the end and who also had
some very kind words of support and
encouragement for our team. It
made us feel a little bit better to know
the opposition recognised that we
were that good.
Archers on
target
Archery
Sunday 30th of January was cold
and windy. Four Imperial College
archers braved this bitter winter
morning to go to the London
County Championships. The shoot
was good fun even though Tim
ruined yet another of the clubs
arrows and our archery captain
missed the target for the first time
in two and a half years of shoot-
ing.
Of the quartet shooting, Tim
and Colin were at their first com-
petition and shot admirably to
contribute to the team's third place
in the county competition. Keith
shot well again and just missed out
on reaching the 5 0 0 mark. Leo
came third in the Ladies Reserve
competition.
Saturday 5th February was the
BUSA indoor archery champi-
onships at Bath University, and
with fingers crossed everyone
should have make it there and
back again with all their arrows in
one piece - and have achieved
some good scores too. The event
was too late to make it into Felix
this week, but you'll be able to find
out how we got on soon. Further
into the future there will be trials to
shoot for the BUSA team in the
World Student Championships in
Madrid.
