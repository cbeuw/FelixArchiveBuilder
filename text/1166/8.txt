When you think back to what life may
have been like in the thirteenth cen-
tury, the idea of laws demanding trial
by jury and a statement of rights for
citizens is unlikely to figure highly. Yet
one of the reasons that England sees
itself as an ancient
home of liberties is
because we had such a
document - the
Magna Carta - which
still has some legal
force today. Later, in
the mid-nineteenth
century, people in Eng-
land and Wales were given further
rights to trial by jury in serious cases;
in the time when public hanging and
flogging were the norm.
Such silly rights are obviously of
no use to us today. Jack Straw, the
Home Secretary, is presently pushing
to abolish the right to trial by jury for
a whole class of offences, with the
intention of savina a few aercent of
" t h e l i g h t t h a t

the criminal justice budget. He has
been criticised by practically every-
one, from civil liberties groups,
lawyers, his own party, all the other
parties and many judges. His bill was
thrown out two weeks ago by the
Lords, with Straw saying he will re-
introduce it in the Commons.
Juries have always
had a way of forcing
some democracy on a
system that is populated
by a distant and mainly
a m p o f f r e e d o m public school and
Oxbridge dominated
b u m s " judiciary: there was a
time once when a jury
deliberation room was being cleared
out and a note from the foreman
found which read "do we all agree:
1. that this judge is a complete bas-
tard; 2. that the judge wants this man
convicted; 3. that we therefore
acquit?" Juries have a common-law
right to acquit even if the case is
apparently stacked against the
defendant, and this 'sympathy

(depending on your opinion) has
been used to protest against silly or
oppressive laws. Some of the more
odious Official Secrets Acts trials in
the seventies and early eighties,
among others, resulted in acquittals
when the defendants were legally in
the wrong.
Civil servants and
politicians, not famous
the precedent may gradually
increase in spirit, to the utter disuse of
juries in cases of the most momen-
tous concern."
There is now a standard method
to justify the removal of liberties: state
the incredible inconvenience the
government has to go through to
lock someone up, criti-
i n n o c e n c e i s a n cise people who defend
the status quo as "fat-
for their skills at looking i n c o n v e n i e n c e t h a t cat lawyers"
beyond the balance
sheet or next election,
often feel that juries are
incapable or too
incompetent to make
decisions on complex matters involv-
ing criminal cases. This is not borne
out by experience - most jurors take
their duties seriously and may be
more likely to imagine themselves in
a street fight, domestic assault or
robbery than many of the magistrates
who would decide instead. Would
you prefer to be tried before twelve
people there to apply 'human expe-
rience' to the case or a bench of
case-hardened magistrates who are
used to the high conviction rate in
their courts?
Straw now follows a well-worn
and unpleasant path to remove these
rights. In opposition he said the
Tories' plan to do the same (later
dropped) was "short-sighted and
wrong". Following the usual conver-
sion ministers have when they get
into government, he has now seen
the light and ditched much of his lib-
eralism in this regard. He follows the
hardened Home Office view the
innocence is an inconvenience that
should be dealt with severely. He is
already trying to stop alleged rapists
or their lawyers from cross-examining
their accusers, and is supporting the
removal of the right to choose one's
own lawyer. He is extending this
argument to trial by jury, going
against an ancient trend, and
ignores the opinion of the late
respected jurist Sir William Black-
stone who said that "delays and
inconveniences in the forms of justice
are the price that all free nations
must pay for their liberty... and that
these inroads upon this sacred bul-
wark of the nation are fundamentally
opposite to the spirit of our constitu-
tion and that though begun in trifles,

though criminal law
has never been a great
money-spinner) and
label others as mem-
bers of the recently cre-
ated new public enemy, the 'forces of
conservatism'. Victims come in useful
here too as all illiberal changes in
criminal law can be in their interest -
they have been hijacked as a blanket
justification since people can see
themselves more easily as victims
than criminals. It is a brave person
who defends the unpopular, and
politicians know they will not win an
election defending criminals' rights.
The sad thing about this is that is
all quite unnecessary. The cost sav-
ings will be eaten up by an appeal
right to the crown court which has to
be put in because of the Human
Rights Act, meaning cases will ping-
pong between courts with lawyers
cashing in all the way. Officials, wit-
nesses and victims will all be delayed
as much or more than under the pre-
vious system. Analogies to the Scot-
tish system (where the right to trial by
jury is curbed) are inappropriate
since there the 'sheriffs' have much
less power anyway.
We ought to feel reasonably
proud of the fact that we cannot be
locked up in this country for more
than a year without twelve ordinary
people agreeing to it. It is frankly
scary that our guilt of serious
offences may soon be decided by
experts and imposed on us, with trial
by jury reserved for the famous or
people with 'a reputation to defend'
(in this proposal your rights to trial by
jury will be genuinely decided by how
important you look). Since only peo-
ple with such reputations are given
the right to trial by jury, the proposal
is itself admitting it may be unfair. If
some of us deserve freedoms, we all
do.
