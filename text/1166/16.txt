U N I O N DENIES
W R O N G D O I N G
Dear Editor,
The sabbatical team would like
to allay any fears, which may have
arisen after last week's allegations of
problems with the distribution of
Union cards. We would like to assure
readers that all of the very few peo-
ple who got their cards on the day of
the E G M were checked against reg-
istry details and for added security
college swipe cards were also
checked. (Anyone who turned up on
the night with registry details would
have been and indeed were issued
cards.)
These students are all based off
campus and thus could only obtain
their cards on the day itself. In the
past the Med school Union has dis-
tributed the cards. This system, long
planned and well thought out, was a
marked improvement! Having photo
ID is also a step up from the current
South Ken routine.
Yours, Tasha Newton, Tim
Trailor, Kevin Butcher, Ian Clifford
FINANCIAL FIASCO
Dear Dave
Firstly congratulations on last
week's issue, one of the best in
recent years. It seems that there was
a strong financial theme running
through many of the stories, which
links in very nicely with the main
headline. The College financial
statements are, as you suggest,
always worth a quick gander, but
while being legally unimpeachable,
they do not give anything like the
whole picture. We do not, for exam-
ple, see the parlous state of Cater-
ing, because it is lumped in with the
Residences cash cow. The same
could be said of Conferencing.
Catering, which has always been in a
hole, should reach the Earth's core
next year if the a proportion of the
SCR costs fall at its feet as the
income projections for the refur-
bished facility miss the costs by a
mile. We don't see how many of
those 362 lucky people of £50,000
per year are in academic positions. It
is no secret that many people on fair-
ly middle ranking grades in Sherfield
are earning in that region. We do not
see the calamitous financial man-
agement in certain divisions of the
ICSM. For all this and more, you
need the infamous Management
and Planning Group reports. Harder
to obtain than a virgin in a maternity
ward, it is high time these were pub-
lished. Next year, will the statements
mention how the College has been
running an overdraft since August
because it paid every supplier's bill
rather than transfer the information
to the universally dreadful new
finance system?
Breakpoint, uncharacteristically
lucid and understandably concerned
about the Hall refurbishments, sug-
gests that we are in no-free-lunch
territory, and he's in part correct. Beit
Hall, refurbished for the 2000 British
Association meeting, could prove
very damaging to our wealth. Bud-
geted for on highly questionable pre-
dictions, it will be first to clobber the
students if things go awry. Thankfully,
no such nonsense is being enter-
tained for Southside, which will be
paid for by the disposal of Montpel-
lier, Brabazon and Garden Halls.
Any rent hikes there will then simply
be profiteering by the College rather
than any necessity borne of impend-
ing doom. It is a great relief that this
silly conferencing model seems to
have been put back in its box before
exposing the College (ie. us) to
unacceptable risk.
And then we have the LSE/IC
merger. This is brilliant news. Yes, it
makes perfect sense, but much more
importantly, it suggests that IC may
soon have a Rector who is prepared
to challenge the old orthodoxies and
who will not tolerate the waste and
inefficiency that is sadly Imperial's
hallmark. Many a good man has
gone native here. Now we have
someone firing salvos before even
starting. G o d help Sherfield.
All the best,
Simon Baker

MINIBUS MISMANAGEMENT?
Dear Dave,
Further to comments on the
catering service provided by college
and the union (letters 17/1, 24/1), I
have discovered yet another service
that is available externally at a lower
price. Since the increase in cost of
union minibus hire from £150 per
weekend to £190, it now works out
£15-£20 cheaper to hire from a
commercial hire-firm. Granted, this
option is greatly facilitated by the
provision of union insurance for driv-
ers under 2 5 , but it still begs the
question of how a non-profit making
organisation can cost more than a
profit making one. An added bonus
is that the cancellation charges for
the commercial firm are approxi-
mately % of the union's exorbitant
fee. Perhaps it's time to seriously
consider Becky Leigh's suggestion to
contract out such services.
Yours,
Colm Carroll

CHRISTIANITY FIGHTS BACK
Dear Sir,
The article last week under the
title of 'Cutting Comment' has given
me some concern over the misrepre-
sentation of the Christian under-
standing of G o d . Andy Vivian states
that G o d is all-good, all-powerful
and all-knowing. This is indeed true.
He asks how this G o d can allow evil
to exist. But he ignores the under-
standing of G o d as one who is full of
love for us. This G o d could destroy
everyone who does anything that is
evil. He could end the world now
and bring an end to evil now. Yet he
does not. His love for us is such that
he will allow each person time,
chance after chance to love him, to
choose the good option. His love is
so great, as we are told, that he sent
Jesus to die for us. Those who turn to
him receive from him such unlimited
amounts of love, which we can never
earn, that he will forgive us, and
The deadline for letters intended for publication is Wednesday 12 noon - drop into the porta-
cabins or email felix@ic.ac.uk. Letters may be edited for length but not grammar or spelling.
