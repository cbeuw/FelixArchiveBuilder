Firstly, thanks to Humming Bird for
offering sexual favours to ensure
the game went ahead (Orange &
BT Cellnet were also a help).
We arrived at the match all
dolled up, but the Essex girls
showed us up with their handbags,
perms and stillettos.
The first half came and went,
with us going to half time with a 1 -
0 lead. After a rousing team talk,
we engaged our brains and
stormed into the second half. O h
yes. Care bear baby fresher Helen
scored some beautiful goals (four
in all), before her donkey genes
became prominent - she managed
to miss four open goals like a
knob. Jo and her flow had a
stormer of a match tackling like a
spinning-top type thing. Nat
rucked a goal like a concrete cow.
G o a l keeper Helen kept a clean
sheet - Sim hasn't been around
recently (she's been suffering from
a bad cough).
In summary, the game play
was sexual - we tonk, tonk, tonk,
tonked like nobody has ever
tonked before. Truly awe-inspiring
stuff.
Big thanks to the umpires G r a -
ham - who's cute and cuddly -
and Alex - who is facially
endowed. Also thanks to anyone
who received a random phone call
during last week.

Can I just say we won! Last year we
got absolutely trashed in the shield
competition, so expectations
weren't high.
Their scrum was eight fat
mamas, and they must have been
twice our weight - but we stuck
with it and gave as good as we
got. Size isn't everything you know
- even when you have "The Big
O n e ! " (Kryzi) on your side.
Their backs weren't that good
either, and their only tactic was to
give it to their forwards and hope
they had enough weight to get
through.
Whenever we got it to our
In Brief
wings, they had loads of space
and caused havoc. After five min-
utes, all our training paid off and
Ali looped around to score our first
try.
After much hard work and
loads of scrums, Ling got the ball
on the wing and went on a brilliant
run to score. They then got a try
back before half time, and the
score stayed the same for most of
the second half, until Ali eventual-
ly broke through to score once
again.
Just before the end they
ploughed over the try line without
ground the ball - but the ref
awarded a try anyway, and Miriam
said "Mae'r dyfarnwr yn *******
ddall!"

Rifle Club
At the end of the last term, six
members of the ICU Rifle and Pis-
tol Club entered the West Kent
Rifle League's Prince William of
Wales competition.
Our highest placed shooter
was Guy Dewhirst, who came 9th
in D class, with a score of 286 out
of 300. Andrew Eldridge came
37th in A class with 2 9 0 . In B
class, Ben Chowdhary and Sam
Sharpe finished 42nd and 106th
respectively, and 11th in their
class for the pairs competition.
Rachel Chan and Leonora Lang
were 69th and 82nd in D class,
and 15th in the pairs shoot.
Other events over the next few
weeks include the BUSA Archery
and Clay Pigeon competitions,
and rifle matches against the uni-
versities of London and Liverpool.
If you are interested in any of
these competitions, or in learning
to shoot, please come down to the
Projectile Hall in the Sports Centre
on a Wednesday or Saturday
afternoon.

This was another easy victory for
the firsts, who continue to slaugh-
ter their opponents in the league.
The centre third was naturally
dominated by (Jess with those
octopus arms), with Jane and
(captain) Dot feeding the ball up
court at every opportunity. The
towering skyscrapers confronting
shooters Shirley and Rebekah
turned out to be Royal Holloway's
defenders, who had the reach, but
sadly lacked the manoeuvrability
to keep up with our girls in the cir-
cle.
At the defensive end, Kathryn
intercepted any Royal Holloway
balls that dared approach the IC
goal third. The little RH shooter,
who had given Alex the run
around in the first half, hardly trou-
bled the scorer in the second half,
adding only one more goal to her
tally, leaving the firsts to walk away
with another comfortable win.

The pie boys were back in town,
and we couldn't run for toffee
(hey, who needs training before
the kick off!). Despite the brave
efforts of our pack, the inbred
convicts got the better of us,
although there was a classic
dump tackle from savage Eddy,
who was blood binned for his
troubles.
In the second half, one of the
ex-cons got a yellow card. Sud-
denly, we sparked into life. Having
beaten seventeen men, made it
past the ref (singing and all) Dave
finally managed to dump it over
the line thanks to a bit of Welsh
wizardry.
Ultimately, however, the Eng-
land A team got the better of us
on the day and finished up by
beating us by just three points,
with a final score of 1 0 - 7 . We
now bow graciously out of the
Cup at the semi-final stage.
Fencing
Imperial 6
Cambridge 12
Although the women's fencing
team made it through to the sec-
ond round of the BUSA Cup, we
were drawn against some strong
opposition.
All the members of the team
performed admirably, however.
Camille stormed her way through
the Cambridge foil team, where
she won all of her fights convinc-
ingly. The other members - Cap-
tain Katherine, Cockney Clare and
'fencing b a g ' Leucha - all con-
tributed extremely well. Katherine
and Camille achieved some amaz-
ing hits on the arm, and there were
some outstanding attacks general-
ly in the foil.
Unfortunately, since C a m -
bridge had three dedicated
epeeists and foilists, they were
placed in a more advantageous
position. Watch this space, howev-
er, for the team's escapades next
year!
