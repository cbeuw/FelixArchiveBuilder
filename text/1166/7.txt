I N C R E A S E - A N D S H O U L D W E R E A L L Y C A R E ?
For my money, it's undoubtedly the latter - and
as such it's something to be applauded, not
castigated.

Screen violence, however, is a completely dif-
ferent matter. To use the same argument would
be to say that we've become readier to accept
violence as an integral part of society. Yet this is
surely contrary to the essence of our beliefs
about the development of civilisation. Surely
the idea is that we've developed past the need
for brutality and pain when it comes to decid-
ing who's best? Then, pray tell, why did millions
of people around the world pay through the
nose to see a convicted rapist beat the hell out
of some British guy they'd never heard of
before last week?
This is where the two strings draw together.
Ignore other issues (brief nudity and a little
swearing never hurt anyone anyway) and
realise that we're living in a society that is not
only increasingly violent, but which revels in
that fact. The reasons for this change are com-
plex. Unlike generations before us, we don't
live in the shadow of war - sure, wars still break
out all over the planet, but the likelihood of
someone invading Britain or any armed conflict
escalating to the scale where the government
would have to reintroduce conscription is now
practically zilch. Meanwhile, our access to the
imagery of war and suffering has grown to an
unprecedented level. Turn on the news or open
your newspaper on any day of the week, and
you're guaranteed to find images of emaciated
victims and bloodthirsty guerrilla forces staring
back at you. Simultaneously, you'll hear ream
after ream of figures splurted out from watch-
dogs, governments a n d research groups,
telling you that the deathtoll from this conflict
was x thousand, or the figures for violent crime
have gone up by y percent. (Disturbingly, gov-
ernment press releases dealing with crime sta-
tistics usually state that car crime and burglary
are decreasing, whilst violent crime and sexual
assault are on the increase).
So, is this the answer? Does sensory over-
load blunt our responses and lead us to
assume that violence is inescapable? Surely not
- after all, time and again history has seen the
most protracted and bloody wars used as a cat-
alyst to promote the creation of a new, idyllic
vision of the future. A classic example came in
the aftermath of the First World War: so
shocked and traumatised were the leaders of
all the nations involved, they vowed never to go
to war again.
The difference, however, is that we have
had no experience of that kind of traumatic
exposure to the horrific side of organised vio-
lence. As far as we're concerned, life is what we
see at the movies and on the TV, and whilst, for
some of us, that might mean we're living in a
Dawson's Creek dreamland, for others it means
a planet where combat only exists as a form of
entertainment (you'd be scared by the ratings
that the W W F gets in both Britain and the US)
or sport (anyone ever watched Ultimte Fight-
ing?). That's not to say that on-screen violence
encourages us to maim and kill our neighbours
(although I'm still not sure that the sight of
Macaulay Culkin happily blasting flamethrow-
ers at his enemies - who then suffer nothing
more than singed eyebrows - is a positive
image for kids); rather it suggests that violence
has become less of a last resort. Crime related
murder and assault continues to climb; bullying
is on the increase; our government feels happy
to level downtown Baghdad at the first sign of
truculence. All three are related by the fact that,
because we've never personally been forced to
experience death up close and personal, we
stoop to the unpleasant solution far more read-
ily. Sure we see death everyday on the news, in
every episode of Casualty or ER, and in every
new summer blockbuster - but it's a sanitised
vision of death, filtered and censored so that it
doesn't offend our middle-class sensibilities. It
doesn't scare or horrify us. It should.
