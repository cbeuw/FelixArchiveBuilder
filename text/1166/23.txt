Buzzcocks
Spiral Scratch
(Mute)
Breakdown, Time's Up,
Boredom and Friends Of
Mine - four songs record-
ed live in 1976, a couple
of years before this total-
ly outstanding punk band
hit the big time. These
don't display the
absolutely perfect pop-
ness of Ever Fallen In
Love? or What Do / Get?
but you can sense the
beginnings of something
amazing.
Eels
Mr E's Beautiful Blues
{DreamWorks)
A sort of contemporary version of
"sweets for my sweet, sugar for my
honey" with a sanitised ska mix and
some growly vocals to separate the
hooks. It made me want to go out
and buy one of the Trojan box sets.
Just sing-a-long to The Searchers and
listen to the top Mellotron usage.
Fixed Stars
Every Night
(Mercury)
Well, whoever fixed the Fixed Stars
was clearly untrained in the art of fix-
ing and evidently possessed the musi-
cal appreciation of a lettuce. Remem-
ber Lightning Seeds horrid experiment
with Life's Too Short - this is like that,
only it smells just that little bit worse.

Gabrielle
Rise
(GoBeort)
"Knock, knock, knocking
on heaven's door. Knock,
knock, knocking on
heaven's door. Knock,
knock, knocking on
heaven's door". She may
have been a slight novel-
ty with her eye patch and
silly wavy hair, but having
ditched both she's not
going to fool me with a
thinly disguised Eric
Clapton cover.
Mariah Carey
Thank God I Found You
(Columbia)
If you're a big Mariah
fan then I expect you'll
really like this - but it's
just like all the others.
Again. Sounds nice but
you'll wonder where
you heard it before. A
bonus, however, is that
she's supported by a
guy named Joe. Just
Joe. Cool.
Campag Velocet
Vito Satan
(Pias)
Brooding guitar based skunk rock
led by Pete Voss' distinctive snarl
(somewhere between a cockney
Liam Gallagher and Ian Brown). As
close as this lot will come to a ten-
der ballad. Not quite the saviours
of the British rock scene, but they
are certainly a band doing some-
thing a bit more daring and inter-
esting than the majority.
DumDums
Everything
(Good Behaviour)
The DumDums look like a corporate,
put together indie/ska/punk Boyzone.
From their hair, denim and brand new
adidas trainers alone, I loathe them.
But, the A side has a lovely tune, even
though they are all of the above.
Expect to hear this song a great deal,
as it will be a chart hit. O n the plus
side, though, the other tracks (as
expected) were absolute tripe. So
they'll be as big as the Stereophonies
in a year then.
Bellatrix
The Girl with the
Sparkling Eyes
(Fierce Panda)
Not unlike Sonya Madan
(of Echobelly fame)
doing the vocals over a
quirky guitar based Bis
track. Bellatrix are anoth-
er original Icelandic
export. The song is very
catchy and simple, with
an angular tune running
throughout. This isn't a
single which will provoke
a particularly strong
reaction - it is, however
very likable and, at best,
nice.
