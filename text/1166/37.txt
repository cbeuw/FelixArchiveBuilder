The Pimlico Connection are hosting
a talk by Johnny Ball, on Wednes-

The lecture will be the final
event of an "Introducing Higher
Education" open day at College,
which is being run jointly by the
Pimlico Connection and the
Schools Liaison Office.
The Pimlico Connection places
student tutors in schools across
London, helping to teach subjects
including maths, science and tech-
nology for a couple of hours on
Wednesday afternoons. As well as
being an immensely rewarding
experience, tutoring also helps to
develop key interpersonal and
communication skills, which are
regarded as essential by most
employers. This March we are
sending two delegates to the inter-
national C O O L Conference in
New Jersey to meet hundreds of
other like-minded students from ail
over the world.
We are also trying out a student
shadowing scheme, which allows
Sixth Form students from the
schools we tutor to experience what
life at Imperial (and indeed at uni-
versity in general), is really like. If
this small pilot goes well, we hope
to extend it into other departments
next year.
If you are interested in the Pim-
lico Connection, contact Adrian or
Elin at the addresses above.
