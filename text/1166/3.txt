A number of residents in Linstead
Hall, Princes Gardens, were
shocked to discover racist graffiti
and comments defacing a hall
blackboard a n d , name tags on
room doors last month.
The acts were first discovered on
Saturday, January 15. A student vis-
iting the room of an Asian friend
found that their name tag had been
defaced. A quick check soon
revealed that the tags of about
twenty other Asian residents - in par-
ticular, those whose name tags sug-
gested they were obviously Asian -
had been similarly defaced, and
that an offensive message targetting
Asians had been written on the
blackboard on Level 1, the hall's
Lower Gallery.
The defaced tags were collected
together and the matter reported to
the subwardens immediately. The
blackboard was scrubbed clean, but
the offending messages reappeared
later on that evening - discovered by
two students returning from Basics
Pizzeria, after being away for fifteen
minutes. This had led to strong sus-
picions that a resident must have
been responsible.
If it was an inside act committed
by a resident, the consequences
would be fairly serious for the stu-
dent (or students) concerned - with
almost certain expulsion not just
from Linstead but from College
itself. At the moment, the matter has
been reported to the police and
security are apparently keeping a
close watch on the situation, but no
further acts of similar vandalism
have been noted.
The next day saw the late-night
discovery that the blue sign saying
"Linstead Hall" outside the hall had
been defaced with a message simi-
lar in tone, written using white cor-
rection fluid. Stickers advocating
white supremacist group Combat
18 were found around the resi-
dence, causing considerable con-
cern amongst residents.
At the time of going to press, the
incidents had not recurred and no
culprit had been found. Warden Dr
Jon Marangos was unable to com-
ment on the issue other than to con-
demn racism and any racist act in
general, but the opinions of individ-
ual Asian residents ranged from "it
must have just been a tasteless
prank" to "whoever did it deserves a
good beating-up from our posse."
The apparent absence of any overt
threats or abuse directly targetting
particular residents thus far, and the
fact that there have not been any
further messages of this kind mean
that not a great deal can be done
apart from monitoring the situation.
Lina Nawas, a reapp in Linstead
Hall, commented that whoever
responsible must have been "really
low to stoop to that level", and
affirmed that those responsible
should be "severely puniished and
kicked out of College" for their activ-
ities. ICU President Tasha Newton,
herself a resident in Linstead Hall,
said that if it turned out that those
involved were actually racist stu-
dents, it would be "very sad" given
the "more interesting backgrounds"
that many students here at Imperial
hail from. Many students Felix has
spoken to have expressed incredulity
and open horror, disgust and shame
that such a tasteless act could be
committed by students at Imperial.

There has been a series of cases of
students rebelling against the
tuition fee system. About 15 stu-
dents from Oxford University have
been expelled for refusing to pay
their fees, and more recently, sev-
eral members of the School of
Oriental and African Studies
(SOAS) - one of the UK's top ten
universities - have also decided
that the cost of education is too
much, and said they will not pay
either. Students occupied the
School's Administration building
last month, causing the School to
close for a day. University College
London Union considered support-
ing the occupation, but the pro-
posal was vetoed at an emergency
general meeting.
For students at IC who can
afford their tuition fees, but refuse
to pay them, the College's policy is
to not allow them to move on to
the next year. Kevin Butcher, Deputy
President (Education and Welfare)
explained that by Christmas last
(academic) year, approximately
forty students still hadn't paid that
fee instalment, but by the end of
the year, the figure had been
reduced to just two or three. These
students did not have the academ-
ic ability to pass that year, and so
could not graduate to the next year
anyway. Some colleges are not so
strict though. O n e student at Gold-
smiths College who refused to pay
his fees was allowed back the fol-
lowing year, running up an increas-
ing debt, which will have to be paid
off before he receives his diploma
- if he does not pay, he will not offi-
cially graduate.
Mr Butcher explained that if
someone decided that they did not
want to pay fees, be it for political
beliefs or anything else, then the
Union would support students but
"not lead them blindly". The Union
would make it clear to the student
in question what the outcome of
his or her decision might be, and
in most cases this would be expul-
sion. At the moment it seems that
if a student is financially sound as
to be able to pay their fees, then
the College will not allow them
back the next year if that sum is not
paid. However, if a student has
the academic potential to pass the
year, and come out with a degree
at the end of the course but is
unable to pay the fee for some
financial crisis, then the College
would acknowledge this fact and
act accordingly. For example, the
8 per cent interest rate for late fees
would be knocked off, or in dire
situations the College might pay
for the student itself. M r Butcher
warned "students must approach
the College as soon as the prob-
lem appears" and the student must
be able to prove their financial sit-
uation.
While the issue of tuition fees
is currently a major area of con-
cern for students, and recent polit-
ical changes have taken the first
step to amend the situation, there
is little choice but to pay if a qual-
ification is desired in the end. Yet if
there are genuine problems with
the payment of fees then the Col-
lege has the ability to help out stu-
dents. In contrast, if the problem is
simply a political opinion, then stu-
dents may have to sacrifice their
degrees for their principles.
