Bowing to grassroots pressure from
Medical School students, proposals
are currently being drawn up in an
attempt to force the College to
accept that the Medical School
Presidency should remain a sabbat-
ical position. However, the need for
support from the highest levels of
College, coupled with the need to
find an additional £ 1 4 0 0 0 of
funding, means that the battle to
secure the position will be a com-
plex and longwinded one.
Although the sabbatical posi-
tion of ICSM Union President was
due to be relinquished at the end of
this academic year (to be replaced
by a non-sabbatical officer), a
combination of student support and
London-wide changes have led cur-
rent incumbent Becky England to
draw up a set of proposals asking
the College to accept the retention
of the sabbatical status. Despite the
fact that the role is a Union posi-
tion, College support is essential,
as without it any student taking a
year out would not be guaranteed
a place the following year.
Before the series of mergers
which created the School of Medi-
cine in 1997, only one of the major
components, the Charing Cross
and Westminster School, had a
sabbatical - however, as the old
(smaller) schools were all based
ICSM do the meeting thang
around one campus, coordinating
student activity was a much simpler
process. Now, medical students
are spread across four main teach-
ing sites, and according to a draft
copy of Becky England's proposal
(which is due to be presented to
College Council later this week), "A
central figure is needed to collate
opinion and then express this at the
relevant committees... only a sab-
batical can hope to fulfil this role".
The real sticking point in the
plans, however, is likely to be the
question of financing. Although
ICU President Natasha Newton
insists that "We need to get permis-
sion to have the sabbatical first,
and then think about details later",

the issue of who is going to pay the
sabbatical salary - approximately
£13 5 0 0 to £14 0 0 0 once taxes
have been included - is one that is
certain to be prominent in the
minds of many of those debating
the issue. Currently, the Union are
only being funded for five sabbati-
cals, and thus the sixth salary (gen-
erated by the addition of the Edu-
cation & Welfare position) must be
found by making cut-backs in other
areas. ICU insists that this situation
cannot continue, and Becky Eng-
land has expressed a hope that the
Medical School itself may be able
to provide funding - but with ICSM
finances currently believed to be in
the same precarious state as those
of the Union, this would seem
unlikely. Whatever happens, how-
ever, ICU's Deputy President
(Finance & Services), Ian Clifford,
insists that external funding must be
found, stating adamantly that
"We're not going to pay".
Although the plan is fully sup-
ported by ICU, there is still a long
way to go before any suggestion
can become a reality, and it may
prove a struggle to force a decision
through the College in time for the
usual round of elections. The key
issue seems to be one of support
from senior staff in the Medical
School - if they throw their weight
behind the proposals, it is thought
that the College will look
favourably on the proposal, and
consequently the Union is seeking
the help of ICSM Principle Chris
Edwards.
One of the biggest factors sup-
porting the proposal is a compari-
son with the other medical schools
across London. O f the four large
groups created in the 1997 round
of mergers, all four currently have
sabbatical positions specifically
designated to deal with medical
issues. More importantly, however,
only ICU plans to remove the posi-
tion at the end of the year, which
clearly suggests that, right across
London, the process of integration
is taking far longer than anyone ini-
tially expected.
