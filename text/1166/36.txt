The picturesque village of Mungris-
dale consists of a village hall with a
pub right opposite. Hence our visit.
Due to circumstances beyond our
self-control, we had no minibus for
the weekend, so three hire-cars were
obtained. Driving in a manner con-
sistent with high speed, Steve and
Jeremy managed the unheard-of feat
of reaching the hall with half an hour
to spare before the pubs shut. Every-
one else rolled up about an hour
later.
Saturday morning and, with a
minimum of faff, everyone scattered
in pursuit of extreme activity. Grind-
ing our teeth at the lack of vertical ice
to climb, we settled for a quick (wet
and slimy) Grade 11+ gill-scramble
followed by rock-climbing. During
some intermediate gear-shopping in
Keswick, Andy stunned the club by
buying new stickies and Steve con-
fused the club by buying a boiler-suit
embroidered with his name and, for
some reason, the words "Vigan
Motors". Meanwhile party No 2 were
wending their way up Sharp Edge on
Blencathra. "Nicest scrambling in the
Lake District", apparently.
Those short winter days meant
that everyone arrived back at the hut
with time to spare, and a restrained
meal (consisting of a mere three
courses) was knocked up in next-to-
no-time by Jeremy, our Part-Time
Strolling Catering Officer Of No
Fixed Abode. Mallet, despite not
coming on the trip, excelled himself
(as usual) by providing a giant dou-
ble chocolate cake with a replica of
the club logo, sculpted in two-tone
chocolate, on top. Nice. A five-hour
pub session ensued.
Sunday was "more-of-the-same"
day: one party off to scramble up
Helvellen and down Striding Edge,
another to do a couple of difficult
scrambles on Doves Nest Crag in
Borrowdale. Right opposite, Jeremy
and Andy found a long, heavily ver-
glassed "Diff" on Raven's Crag.
Despite the mile between the two
parties, curious echos meant that
Andy (belaying from the first stance)
and Steve (noshing at the foot of a
Grade III scramble) could converse
almost normally: normally in this
case meaning shouting "Omlette!"
at each other. Back at the hut and,
with mere moments left before our
southward journey, Claire rushed in
with the news that ice-climbers had
been sighted on Helvellen. "Arse",
we said.
If these tales of daring-do and
custard inspire you to emulate our
Olympian exertions, we'd be delight-
ed to have you join us on one of our
merry jaunts. Just find your way to
Southside Upper Lounge any Thurs-
day at 7pm and introduce yourself.
