GAYNOR LEWIS REVEALS ALL!
In this FELIX exclusive interview Gaynor
Lewis talks about her successes and
disappointments during her year as
President and answers some of the
criticisms levelled against her.
FELIX: What do you think that
you've achieved in your year
as President?
Gaynor Lewis: I think we've
achieved quite a lot this year
really, both in the services
provided by the Union and the
clubs and societies within the
Union. We changed London
Student Travel over to a Sport's
Shop and introduced a new
travel centre providing, we
hope, a better service. The
change, handover, in the
refectories. We don't know
whether it's going to be
successful or not. Differences
made in the transport system
will be of benefit to a large
number of students at IC. It
will mean that a lot more clubs
and societies will be using the
transport system.
How do you feel that what
you've achieved has lived up
to your expectations at the
beginning of year? Have you
achieved everything you set
out to do?
I think a lot of the things that
we set out to do at the
beginning of our year were to
finish a lot of the previous
year's business. One of the
major objectives was the
provision of the central
l a u n d e r e t t e f a c i l i t y in
Southside. We finished what
Steve Goulder had started.
This will be a great success.
This was due to input by
Union officers and the Rugby
and Boat Club.
Although there have been
delays in t h e Central
launderette, things have gone
quicker than last year.
You've come in for criticism in
that you've concentrated on
Internal Affairs as opposed to
the External Affairs of the
Union.
I think that we have officers to
deal with every aspect of the
U n i o n — w e have lots of
support from sabbatical
officers. I think the Internal
Services of the Union were in a
mess at the start of the year. I
think you've got to take things
slowly, one step at a time. You
can't concentrate all the time
on everything. There was
interest this year among the
sabbaticals to concentrate on
internal affairs. I think that
Peter Burt, the External Affairs
President Gaynor Lewis
Officer has done a very good
job.
You mentioned the Union take
over of the refectory earlier.
You clearly consider this to be
one of your major achieve-
ments.
I think it's one of the major
steps forward taken by the
Union—the decision was
made by College to help us
financially and in a supportive
way. It has yet to be proven
whether or not the refectory
will be a success under Union
management.
What would be the conse-
quences of failure?
I don't know! It's not going to
fail. As far as we see at the
moment there is no need for
that refectory to fail. If it does
we'll have lost a fair amount of
financial support by College
and there will be problems
with the staff that we appoint.
It's up to the students to come
and support the refectory.
Mr Mooney will leave in April
1985. Do you forsee any great
changes in the refectory
system after that?
I didn't know Mr Mooney was
about to leave in April 1985. Mr
Mooney's been leaving this
College so long I can't remem-
ber when the first date was.
What's your opinion of the
new C h a i r m a n of the
Refectory Committee, Dr
Simon Perry?
I think Simon Perry tries very
hard. I have been disap-
pointed that the Refectory
Committee don't seem to be
able to make decisions when
called upon. He chairs the
committee well on most
occasions. When decisive
action is called for we have felt
that he's been slightly lacking.
Criticism has also come from
those who perceive that
decisions In the Union are
made too high up without
sufficient consultation of
student representatives.
I think many decisions inside
the Union are taken by the
Exec due to lack of time. I don't
think they are taken without
consultation. I am sure you're
r e f e r r i n g t o d e c i s i o n s
regarding the telephones. It is
claimed I made the decision
myself that's not correct. I
indicated what I thought the
outline should be—I dis-
cussed it with more than one
of the Union officers and more
than one of next year's Union
Officers, and this was
accepted by many.
You have been critical of
FELIX in your annual report
for this year and in the first
term FELIX made personal
attacks on Michael Arthur and
Student Services in general.
Do you feel that these attacks
were Justified?
My comments about FELIX in
my annual report stated that I
was disappointed that I was
continually having to correct
inaccuracies in FELIX.
To whom did you have to
correct these inaccuracies?
To students who came to see
me after articles had been
printed in FELIX asking why
such a situation occurred. As
far as attacks on Michael
Arthur are concerned I would
say that on a number of
occasions Michael has not
lived up to his job as much as I
would have liked him to do. I
think that he should come in
for criticism. But I felt that
FELIX were continually
criticising, sometimes without
reason, sometimes with
reason. Any criticism that we
made of Michael Arthur on
College committees was not
taken seriously. This has
caused problems as far as
students are concerned.
We've felt that we're flogging a
dead horse because of the
attitude of College adminis-
tration after certain issues of
FELIX.
FELIX has to be contro-
versial—it can be contro-
versial and work together with
the Union officers rather than
working against them at all
times.
In some cases FELIX has
reported well, in the interest of
students—these reports have
helped us a great deal.
Your award of a UGA to Ian
Bull was controversial in that
it was an award to a very close
friend. Do you think that it was
politically wise to make that
award?
Ian Bull in his work as ACC
Chairman thoroughly de-
served a UGA and that was the
policy that I used in deciding
who I would award them to.
What confidence do you have
in next year's three sabbatical
officers?
I hope they will work together
very well as ateam. We, in fact,
have four sabbaticals next
year—I think they will work
together well. I think that the
experience that they've had in
all their jobs amounts to more
than we had at the start of our
year.
Everyone who reads FELIX is
anxious to know what
happens to sabbaticals after
they finish their term of office.
Can you tell us what you will
be doing next year?
Next year I will be working for
Lloyds Bank on a Manage-
ment Development course in
one of their branches in the
city.
