have been able to help you had you
filled in the relevant forms in triplicate
three months before you were born.
You persist, and he concedes that he
might have a room—he will check, but
only if you have a chequebook and
bank statement. If you do not have
these, goto the Servicetill at once 53. If
you do, throw two dice for the result of
the check—less than five: he tells you
to get lost 46; double six: he gives you
the keys to a room in Southside 4.
Otherwise, you receive keys to a room
in the Fremantle Hotel. If you refuse it,
go to 46. If you accept, go to the
Fremantie Hotel 54.

Chris Teller is sitting behind her desk,
poring over a clandestine photocopy of
an account sheet . She glares at you
'You look lik an ordinary student to me.
If you are, get out of my sight!' If you
have a pewter pot, show it to her 22.
Otherise, go to 47.

There are two lines of attack on this
difficult problem: go to the Union
Office 47 or g o directly to John Smith

The minced beef roll doesn't agree with
you. You must do battle with It.

You catch the lift in the Sherfield
Building and go up to level 5. You find
John Smith's office and knock on the
door. A distant voice is heard to call
'Come In!' Trembling, you open the
door. Lose one point of intelligence
because your terror is affecting your
ability to think. John Smith looks up
from a bundle of papers marked
'Confidential'.
'Sit down. What can I do for you?'
When you mention your telephone,
he strokes his chin thoughtfully and
gazes at you as if calculating how much
you can afford.
'I don't suppose,' he asks slowly, 'you
know of any sherry.'
If you have sherry, you may give it to
him 16.
If you know any scandal on John
Smith, you may try to blackmail him 8.
Otherwise, you must do battle with him
22
Chris smiles engagingly and invites
you in to sit beside her. Coyly, she asks
what she can doforyou. But when you
mention telephones, she throws her
head back and laughs aloud. 'That's
much too trivial for me to deal with! I'm
afraid you 'II have to ask Jen or
Gaynor.' Go to 47.
23
You cross Prince's Gardens and go into
the Student Services Office. You are
met by a rather ugly thug with short
ginger hair who growls, 'What do you
want?' You reply that you have come to
see Michael Arthur. The thug, Gary
Turner, snarls that Arthur is too busy
smart-arsing around College and adds
with a sneer 'He never wastes time with '
snivelling little nobodies like you
anyway.'
You must fight

Constitution: 4
You win (surprise, surprise!) afid go to
17.
24
Gaynor turns pale when you mention
some of the things you have found out
about her. She agrees to have a word
with Jen. However, if you want to see
this thing through, you might as well
consult the real power in the Union
Office 39.
25
Unfortunately, you are now very
hungry. Lose 2 constitution points. Do
you want to go to the FELIX Office to
dig up some scandal 50 or would you
rather just go and see about the phone?
19.
26
Jen turns pale when she hears you
have been to see Dave Rowe. She
immediately authorises Estates to
install a phone for you. Go to 13.
27
You must do one more round of battle
with the Servicetill. However, now that
you have requested a statement, its
special high-security program has
been activiated, and its intelligence
shoots up to 10. If you win, it dispenses
your statement. Go to 43. If you lose
repeat this step or thump the machine
31.
28
If you lose, go to 51. If you win, she says
she will have a word with Jen.
Disgruntled, you go to talk to Jen
yourself 39.
29
The gravy sets as hard as concrete
inside your digestive system. Go to 51.
30
The homebrew Is suprisingly
nourishing and your constitution
points return to maximum. You are also
pissed out of your mind. If you choose
to keep the pewter pot, put in your
Waitrose bag. Go to 52.
31
You thump the machine as hard as you
can with your fist. Roll one die to see
what happens. On a score of 6, it
dispenses £50, a chequebook and your
statement. Go to 43. On a score of 1-5,
the machine does nothing but the Bank
Manager comes tearing up the stairs
,two at a time, screaming and shaking
'his fist at you. It seems you must do
battle with him.

Constitution 8
If you lose, go to 51. If you win, look in
all his pockets. Y o u find £20 and a
strange golden card. Insert this card
into the Servicetill and it immediately
spits out £50, your chequebook and
your statement, uo to 43.
32
Something on the table just inside the
door catches your eye. It is a pewter
tankard containing strong-smelling
illicit homebrew. It must have been left
by the previous occupant. Do you drink
it 30 or leave it 52?
33
You now have money and a room. You
may wish to try to get your phone right
away 19. Alternatively, you can prepare
yourself for the task ahead by either
going to the FELIX Office 50 to see if
you can glean any useful information
or going to get something to eat 48.
34
You must have more money than
sense! Go to 6.

You may ask it for a chequebook 12 or
thump it 31. If you lose, try the round
again or thump it 31.

may be useful. Do you want to go and
have a meal 48 or find out about your
phone right now 19.

If you lose, go to 51. If you win, finish
off her glass of sherry—it restoresyour
constitution to maximum. You may
also steal Jen's 'treasure'—a full crate
of Tio Pepe. However, you must now go
and see John Smith about your phone
21.
38
Hugh is visibly upset, and keeps
bellowing 'I'll kill him!' You manage to
calm him down, andfindoutthat he has
been viciously insulted by the FELIX
Editor-elect David Rowe. Hugh tells
you all about Rowe's 'Hotel High Jinks'
at the NUS Conference. You file this
scandal away for future reference and
return to the walkway 33
39
You go into Jen's office and find her
sipping a glass of pale, dry sherry. You
ask her if you can have a telephone in -
your room. She refuses point blank'I'm
sorry, dearie, you're just not important
enough.' If you have found out any
scandal about Jen, you may attempt to
blackmail her 26. Otherwise you must
fight her 37.
40
On the way, a tile falls from a building.
Throw one die. If you score 1, go to 51.
If it is a 6, the tile misses. Otherwise it
strikes a glancing blow and you lose 2
constitution points. You arrive at
Hector Cameron Clark's office and do
battle.

You recognise the stranger. It is Hugh
'Greystoke' Stiles! Do you run way
(lose one constitution point, go to 33) or
stay and talk to him? 38
42
Dave offers you information
concerning John Smith for £20 and
Gaynor Lewis and Jen Hardy-Smith for
£10 each. You have three choices: you
may pay for some or all of these and
leave (remember to deduct the money
from your score) 36. If you have found
out any scandal about Dave today, you
may try to blackmail him 9. Otherwise,
you must do battle with him 45.
43
You have everything you need, so goto
Student Services 23.
44
You go into the Sherfield Refectory and
queue for half an hour; by the time you
are served, there is only one meal
left—it is soggy chips, battered mince
beef roll and greyish, viscous gravy.
You have no choice but to take it and
you proceed to the till. The cashier
adds up in his head and asks for £10.
Do you pay up 34 or fight the cashier 15

excessive 'smoking', drinking and
screwing at the Union's expense!)
If you lose, go to 51. If you win, drink his
glass of red wine—your constitution is
restored to maximum. Run upstairs
and have a quick look round the
upstairs office. You find files marked
'John Smith', 'Gaynor Lewis' and 'Jen
Hardy-Smith'. You also find the FELIX
Editor's pot. You may take some or all
of these. Go to 36.
46
You are furious with Arthur, and do
battle with him
Michael Arthur
Intelligence 4
Constitution 8
Note that his lack of intelligence is set
off by the fact that Karen and Anna
advise him constantly throughout the
battle. His intelligence is thus
effectively 8. If you lose, go to 51. If you
win take the keys to the Southside
room and go to 4.
47
You are in the Union Office and can see
four doors. Do you go into the one
marked 'Sean Davis' 55, 'Christine
Teller' 18, 'Gaynor Lewis' 7 or 'Jen
Hardy-Smith' 39?
48
You need a meal: you have a choice of
the RCA 5, or Sherfield 44. If neither of
these suit you, do without 25.
49
Congratulations! You have survived yet
another Mooney meal. But beware—if
you keep on taking such needless
risks, you will come a cropper sooner
rather than later! Do you want to go and
find out about scandal in the FELIX
Office 50 or go and find out about your
phone 19?
50
You go into the FELIX Office. There sits
Dave Rowe, with one arm round a
nubile young girl and a 'cigarette' and a
glass of red wine in the other hand. Roll
two dice. If the total is 8 or more, you
have succeeded in attracting his
attention 42. If you fail, you may go and
see about a phone 19 or go and have a
meal 48.
51
Unfortunately you are seriously
injured. Take a year outof College and
start all over again at 1.
52
All of a sudden, the lights go out—it
seems that water has affected the
wiring—do you go back to Student
Services to complain 46 or attempt to
change the bulb 10.
53
You go along the walkway and arrive at
the Servicetill. Insert your card. Do you
ask it for money 35 or just bash it with
your fist 31.
54
You walk to the Fremantle Hotel (lose 1
point of constitution, it's a bloody long
way down Cromwell Road!). You pull
out your key and try to get it into the
lock. It takes a good five minutes of
fiddling to get it in. Fortunately
someone who is coming out opens the
door. You find your way up three flights
of dark and rickety stairs. On the
landing, you are overpowered by a
strong smell of mildew (lose 1 point of
constitution). You open the door of
your new room and are hit by a torrent
of water, which has built up due to the
damp. Roll two dice. If you score less
than 5, go to 51. Otherwise you are
thoroughly soaked and lose 3
constitution points go to 32.
55
You go into Sean's office. He is
standing with his arms plunged into the
innards of a Gestetner machine. He
looks at you blankly then pronounces
in rasping yet lilting tones
'Begorra horrseeyesscorryhouse
gestetnerdefonct meatphalnanbread
onyonbargeeze' and gestures vaguely
with an inky roller. Obviously he thinks
you've come to mend the Gestetner.
Return to 47.
