SPORTS REVIEW
ICclubs strong as ever
As another year draws to a close
the time has come to look back
and reflect upon the achievments
of yet another outstanding
sporting year.
This year has been significant
for our affiliation to U A U and
subsequent brilliant perfor-
mances by the Vollebyall, Water
Polo and Hanging Gliding teams
to carry off their respective
trophies.
First a mention for the Water
Polo Club. Back in December
they got through to the U A U
national final by winning the very
closely contested Southern
Universities Championship.
They went on to clinch the
national trophy in a dramatic
deciding game against Lough-
borough with two goals inside the
final minute.
The Volleyball team also had
similar success, winning their
U A U final 3-2 against
Birmingham.
Ladies Rugbv-a pushover
During the same week the
Hang Gliding Club went to
Swansea to compete in the first
inter-university hang gliding
competition. They came back
impressive victors, having beaten
Plymouth and Manchester Polys
into second and third places
respectively.
A special mention must go to
the Basketball Club who before
this year had not won a game for
a season and a half. Under the
Breaking roofing tiles
inspired leadership of Tim Vink
they went on to put all of this
behind them by winning the
London Colleges League, only
losing one game in the process.
The Boat Club continued to
uphold its brilliant reputation
with notable performances at all
levels. The best performance
probably came from the first
eight in the Head of the River race
where they came ninth overall.
This was the best performance by
a college side since the 1960s.
The Sailing Club have also
produced some consistent
performances throughout the
year. In February they regained
the Castaways Cup beating QMC
in the final and thus avenging last
year's defeat.
The Judo Club excelled again
this year with the men's team
winning the annual inter-
collegiate competition for the
third yeart running and the ladies
coming third in their event.
Turning to athletics, the 36th
running of the Hyde Park Relay
was again a great success despite
the bad conditions with
Loughborough and WLIHE
retaining the men's and ladies'
' trophies respectively. In the ULU
Track and Field Championships
there were several notable
performances by Imperial
with Karate Club
athletes. In particular, there were
triumphs from Thales Kasagonnis
in the pole vault and Richard
Johnson in the triple jump.
The Rugby Club failed in their
valiant attempt to regain the
Gutteridge Cup which they last
won two years ago. They were
knocked out in the semi-final by
Westminster Hospital in a close
match.
The Ladies Rugby Club hit the
headlines earlier this year when
they were filmed by LWT for The
Six O'clock Show. The match
played against QMC was won 8-4
by IC's ladies.
The Badminton Club reached
the U L U Knockout Cup Final
for the third year running. The
final hasn't been played yet, but
IC are clear favourites to retain
the trophy, Whilst not
performing up to their usual
standard in the league, mainly
due to some dodgy match
claiming tactics used by other
clubs, all six teams finished in the
top three in their leagues.
The Cricket Club have shown
they would be in for a very good
season if it would only stop
raining! They easily won the
UAU Southern Indoor Cham-
pionships comprehensively
beating UEA in the final.
Finally we come to the
Football Club. On the whole it
was a fairly uninspired year for
the Football Club, the one bright
spot being the marvellous cup
run by the third team who were
unlucky to lose in the final of
their competition to a late goal
from QMC Seconds. A special
mention to the sixth team who
must be the most underrated
bunch of lads in the College.
Congratulations to all of the
outstanding sporting achieve-
ments that have taken place at
Imperial this year and FELIX
would like to take this
opportunity to wish all of the
sports clubs the very best for the
future.
Imperial is the best sporting
college in London. Let's hope we
can keep it that way.
