Benefits over the Summer
Unlike the Christmas and Easter
holidays, there is no element included
in the student grant to cover
maintenance over the summer
vacation and therefore if you are
unable to get a job between July and
October you will be eligible to 'sign
on' as unemployed in the area in
which you are living.
There are three main types of
benefit: unemployment benefit,
supplementary benefit and housing
benefit.
They are not mutually exclusive
and therefore it is possible to receive
two or all three types of benefits
simultaneously (but only up to a
maximum ofapprox £27+ rent a week
for a single person).
1. Unemployment Benefit
To be eligible for this you will have to
have paid or been credited with Class
1 National Insurance contributions
on earnings of at least £ 1,475 between
April 1982 and March 1983. This will
give you a basic rate of £27 per week
or a little less if you do not quite meet
the contribution conditions. You will
automatically be given the claim
forms for unemployment benefit
when you sign on (see 'How to Claim'
below) but take your P45 and a note
of your National Insurance number
with you.
2. Supplementary Benefit
Originally conceived as a 'safety net'
for those unable to meet the
contribution conditions for
unemployment benefit but now
provides the principal source of
income for a large proportion of the
country's unemployed including
most student claimants. Eligibility is
primarily dependent on the
claimant's ability to sign on as
available for work in the area in
which they are living. There are two
rates of benefit: householder and
non-householder. 'Householder'
implies someone who is individually
responsible for all household
expenses but even if you share a flat or
house with others but have your own
room, meters, etc. it may be possible
to argue that you are maintaining a
separate household. If you think you
have been incorrectly classified you
can appeal (see below). The basic
rates for Supplementary Benefit are:
householder £ 2 6 . 8 0 ; non-
householder £21.45.
How to Claim Unemployment or
Supplementary Benefit
On the first weekday of the vacation
go down to your local unemployment
benefit office (addresses in the phone
book) and sign on as available for
work. They will tell you any future
arrangements for signing on, get you
to fill in a number of forms and give
you a Bl claim form which should be
taken or sent to the local
Supplementary Benefit Office. You
may be called for an interview by this
office and you will need to take with
you proof of identity, recent bank
• statements and your rent
book/tenancy agreement/letter from
your landlord (Student Services if in
In these days when money is tight and the DHSS
is even tighter you need to know all you can
about your entitlements if you're not going to get
screwed. In this article Student Services Welfare
Adviser Karen Stott explains the ins and outs of
the benefits game.
College accommodation).
Anyone receiving supplemenatry
benefit is entitled to free NHS dental
treatment, glasses and prescriptions.
So if you think you might be needing
any of them ask about claiming whilst
you are at the DHSS office.
3. Housing Benefit
Responsibility for meeting housing
costs now lies with local housing
authorities. There are three types of
benefits:
a) Certified Housing Benefit— for
those receiving supplementary
benefit and so called because
eligibility is dependent on receipt of a
certificate of entitlement from the
DHSS. Under this benefit you may
receive 1
0
0
% of your housing costs.
b) Standard Housing Benefit-
anyone can apply. The basic rebate is
60% of your rent and rates on weekly
earnings of around £60 for a single
person with additions or deductions if
your income is above or below that
level.
c) Housing Benefit Supplement- an
addition to standard housing benefit
for those who apply but narrowly
miss qualifying for supplementary
benefit on income grounds.
Students can apply for housing
benefit in term time and vacations
although term time eligibility is
limited. During the summer your
entitlement will depend on your
circumstances. If you are
unemployed and receiving
supplementary or unemployment
benefit, you should get 90-100% of
your housing costs back through
certificated housing benefit or
through standard housing benefit and
housing benefit supplement. If you
are working, you may still be able to
claim some money back, depending
on your income, through standard
housing benefit. Since standard
housing benefit can be paid during
temporary absences from your
normal 'home' you may also be able
to get some help if you have to pay a
retainer on your term time
accommodation over the summer but
you will need to convince the housing
authority that your term time address
is in fact your 'home'.
How to Claim Housing Benefit
If you are claiming Unemployment or
Supplementary Benefit then all you
need to do is to make it clear to the
people dealing with your claim that
you wish to claim Housing Benefit.
They should then send you all the
appropriate forms to be completed
and returned to your local housing
authority.
For standard housing benefit call
into the local housing authority office
(usually based in the Town Hall) for
the area in which you are paying rent,
or for boroughs around College,
come into Student Services and
collect a housing benefit application
form. Your claim will be dated from
the day on which your completed
forms are received by your local
housing office and you will need to
submit proof of your rent and proof
of your income with the application.

FOR THOSE NOT LIVING IN COLLEGE ACCOMMODATION: You can
'sign on' at any Unemployment Benefit Office (addresses in the phone book
under 'Employment Offices') and they should be able to tell you which is your
appropriate DHSS and Housing Benefit offices. Alternatively, Student Services
has a list of the offices relevant to each London postal district.
The housing authority do have the
power to reduce the amount they pay
if they consider your rent to be
excessively high. If you think they
have used this power unreasonably
you can appeal (see belovv). If you are
trying to use standard housing benefit
to reclaim money that you have to
pay as a retainer on your term time
accommodation, then you must
submit a claim to the relevant housing
authority in London.
Some points to note with claiming
benefits
Holidays: Housing Benefit can be
paid during temporary absences but
you should let the housing benefit
office know your plans. For
unemployment/ supplementary
benefit you can complete a holiday
form which will allow you up to
sixteen days away within the British
Isles without losing benefit but you
must sign on again as soon as you
return. If you go on holiday abroad
you will not be entitled to any benefit
whilst you are out of the country and
you must start a completely new
claim as soon as you return.
Co-habiting: When an unmarried
couple-live together as husband and
wife they are treated as a married
couple for benefit purposes. The
official reason for this regulation is to
be fair to married couples, but since a
married couple receive considerably
less benefit than two single people it is
easy to see another reason for the
persistence with which this regulation
is followed up. If you are classified as
co-habiting only one of you will be
allowed to make a claim with the
other person being treated as your
dependent. To avoid being classed as
a couple you will have to prove that
the two of you live totally
independently as regards rent and
other bills, and you will usually need
to prove you have your own rooms. If
you feel you have been unjustly
classified then appeal (see below).
Appeals: Ifyoufeel your benefit has
been incorrectly or unfairly assessed
don't be afraid to appeal. With both
supplementary and housing benefit
you have the right to appeal to a
supplementary benefit tribunal or
local authority review board
whichever is appropriate. However,
delay in asking for a review could
cause you to lose your right to appeal.
So if you are unsure about your
benefit write to the relevant authority
as early as possible asking for a full
breakdown and indicating your
intention to appeal if necessary. If
you want to know more about the
appeals procedure. Student Services
can give you an outline of what
happens and represent you at a
tribunal or review board if you so
wish. We can also help you check
your assessment to see if an error has
been made and help with chasing up
unpaid benefits. Just call into the
