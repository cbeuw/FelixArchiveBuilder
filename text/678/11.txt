'In Napoleonic style Balls grabbed

debutantes he would be able to meet.
"Oh, about the sports clubs and the
like," enquired Huge with his usual
boyish enthusiasm.
"Not quite, my dear boy," replied
Dave the Rave. "Obtaining good staff
these days is so difficult," he mused.
"And are we having a music page?"
asked Huge earnestly. This suggestion
was more than enough for Dave the
Rave who, with a sudden flourish
stubbed out his 'cigarette', finished his
glass of wine to show his irritation.
Glancing out of the window he noticed
Gormless striding past en route to the
Citizens' Office—and that very tight
jumper.
"Mega!" said Huge, believing he was
going to be able to write dreary music
articles.
"Hardly," replied Dave the Rave
whose mind was still rather occupied by
Gormless' cleavage.
Huge just frowned and went off to find
some other people to irritate while
Gormless waddled—the jeans were too
tight for walking—up to the Citizens'
Office.
As ever, the occupants of the office
, were working busily away at their chores
with the afternoon's horse racing
illuminating the superfluous television
screen. Len Pissmore, who had moved
into the office while President and had
never quite managed to leave, sat in
front of it.
"Begora! Oi think oi've won—and it's
5-1 to be sure,' he shouted, in his thick
accent, while clutching a tankard of
mead.
Drunk by the early afternoon—little
had changed in the four years which
Pissmore had spent there.
"Well done darling," replied Mrs Jolly
Hockey-Sticks, who had become rather
interested in the sport of kings in recent
the crown and placed it firmly on his
times.
"How about it Ken—instead of
wasting all that money on those clubs
why not put a few hundred on the gee-
gees?"
Mrs Sticks was addressing Ken
Wheel, the Citizens' Money Expert, who
spent many hours poring over vast
ledgers.
"I don't think I've got the
courage—Dutch or otherwise," replied
Ken, Mrs Sticks was not always very
quick at getting a hint, but she knew
what Ken wanted and in a trice he had a
substantial glass of sherry in front of him.
"Don't I get one?" asked Hippo
Claybrain, who had appointed herself as
the receptionist and spent most'of the
day sitting in the office planning what she
wasn't going to do in her new post as
Citizens' External Representative.
"Oh no darling," replied Mrs Sticks,
"not while you're on duty—we can't all
be tipsy or we might be helpful when we
answer the telephone. Anyway, you'll be
able to have as much as you want when
you get elected."
"Yes—and I must start thinking about
my campaign," replied Claybrain. "I
think I'll go for the 'I've no new ideas but
I'm good looking' tactic." At which point
Len Pissmore burst into a fit of laughter
and promptly spilt his mead over
himself. The general amusement came
to a halt when Gormless stormed into
the office.
"What's the matter?" enquired Hippo,
who could always tell when Gormless
was upset.
"Oh, it's nothing," she sobbed, "I
thought I'd come back and keep an eye
on things—I am still President you
know."
"Indeed you are," replied Mrs Sticks,
"and you have got a meeting with The
Baron in five minutes."
Gormless stormed out of the office in
the same manner with which she had
entered and headed towards the
dreaded Surefield building where the
Baron was being briefed by John
Secretary.
"...and we have managed to off-load
the dreadful loss-making gruel outlet to
the Citizens and we have of course got
some of our own people in the Citizens'
Office to keep an eye on things,"
announced John Secretary to his
superior.
"Oh, and who are they?" enquired the
Baron.
"As usual the three sabbaticals,"
replied John Secretary, rather surprised
at the naivety of the Baron's question.
"So there won't be any problems—if I'm
to get in the newspapers again I don't
want any problems in Cheapskate. You
know how sordid the papers can
be—almost as bad as FALIX," said the
Baron.
"There won't be any problems—I'll
see to that," replied John Secretary in a
most casual tone of voice.
"And it's time for the meeting—
Gormless should be here by now."
John Secretary led the way and, as
with everything else, the Baron simply
followed.
John Secretary led the way and as with everything else the Baro
followed.
