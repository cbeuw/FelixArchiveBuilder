carried along, as part of a'
group, on a wave of
enthusiasm, each relying on the
others reputed experience, into
a potentially dangerous
situation. Numerous solo
climbs and long distance walks
have been safely and
successfully completed.
If the clubs are to maintain
their current high calibre, with
regular meets and annual
expeditions, then it is essential
that R C C safety policy
documents do not adopt the
attitude of forcibly kerbing
efforts to 'push the limits'.

Dear Pallab
This seems to be the last
straw. Having already sought
medical advice, I have been left
with no other choice but to tell
everyone in Imperial about my
frustration in having to work
with two bloody annoying
women.
The first one of these women
is called Gayer (or something
like that). She is an Irish midget
who claims to come from
Wales. However we have been
able to find out her true
identity. Apparently she was
born on 1 April 1962 in Ballina,
Co Mayo and lived there for the
first sixteen years of her life
before defecting to London as a
"Death to all trees that loose
their leaves before 1
September". Unfortunately she
has now managed to infiltrate
IC Union and therefore has
access to a lot of strictly
confidential files. Her true
identity was first discovered
when she tried to pass herself
off as a garden gnome in ULU
swimming pool on 21 July of
this year. On being appre-
hended by the U L U security
officer she was found to have
twenty-six varieties of leaves in
the padding of her shoes. Also
on 28 July she was removed
from Princes Gardens for
attacking a chestnut tree with a
butter knife and shouting
loudly in the air "Death to all
trees that loose their leaves
before 1 September".
The other so called woman is
known in the trade as Yes
Please Teller. The reason for the
Yes Please is because she can
never say no to a 16oz can of
Heinz Baked Beans. On one
occasion she was seen to drink
the guts of eight cans of this
inebriating substance and the
next day proceeded to march
around the Union Office
followed by a long green line.
The smell being so intoxicating
that one sabbatical and two
staff had to be rushed to St
Stephens Hospital casualty
department to have their noses
pumped out and their toe nails
shorted by 2.2mm due to a
gathering of brown blotches in
these parts. On another
occasion, after having eaten
three puppadoms, two onion
bajis, a meat phal, boiled rice
and a nan bread, the fire
department had to be called to
release her head from a bowl in
the gents bogs. On being freed
she explained that the smell was
so bad she had to stick her nose
somewhere because she was
almost overcome with the
fumes.
Both these people are a
menace to public safety and I do
not think the public can sleep
safely at night knowing they are
still at large.

breakdown,

I've seen

Sir
As the sole upholder of
private enterprise and free
speech at Imperial College, I
feel that it is my duty to expose
the plot of a group of Soviet
Bolshevik infiltrators who
have of late succeeded in
manipulating the glorious IC
Conservative Society to their
own devious revolutionary
ends.
It is quite clear that Jonathan
Gerson, the token wet on the
Consoc executive, has over the
course of the year been
subjected to merciless
intimidation and harrassment
by those who wish to drag the
society into supporting a
dubious range of trendy left
wing causes. The principal
instigators of this conspiracy,
who doubtless have backing
from the Kremlin itself, are the
Stalinite J Martin Taylor and
his Marxist cronie, Graham
Brown. These socialist
degenerates and their comrades
have the sole aim of subverting,
nay, perverting, our British
youth from the fine upstanding
moral values which have for so
long been the pride of our
country.
This kind of behaviour is, of
course, not on, and I would
urge all decent, patriotic IC
spongers, sorry, students, to
have no truck with this kind of
corrupt nonsense, and jolly well
tell the blighters to get stuffed.
Yours, in defence of
libertarian values,

Dear Pallab
I recently had cause to glance
back through this year's issues
of your worthy publication,
paying particular attention to
letters from such socialist
luminaries as John Sattaur,
Peter Burt and Robin Graham.
Imagine my surprise on
realising that these people
whom I had previously
dismissed as "frothing at the
mouth Commies" are actually
purveyors of common sense,
and sound humanitarian
philosophy. I now know that I
have merely been a tool of the
reactionary capitalist/racist/
sexist forces led by the likes of
Ian McGregor and Rupert
Murdoch. I can see that there is
a right wing conspiracy to
subjugate us, turn us into an
army of unemployed zombies,
and lead us into war against
President Cherenko. As I
know tht President Chernenko
is a peaceful man who merely
wishes to protect his people
from the evils of the free
market, I am obliged to bring
this conspiracy to light, and to
protest against it. My first act of
protest will be to tear up my
Conservative Party member-
ship card, and to join the
Labour Club and even Veg Soc.
Oh, what a fool I was to
criticise FELIX as I have done.
I see now that you too are a
victim of the class struggle. As
long as your overlords in the
Union Office control the
account book and the sherry
cabinet, you will remain
shackled to your photo-
typesetter in the dingy pit under
Beit Arch. It is a credit to you
that you were broad-minded
enough to print my letters at all.
Even my PSs had Fascist
connotations. Asking for offers
of 'drinks/jobs/marriages' is
clearly decadent capitalist and
anti-gay rights.
Smash Thatcher.
Ban the Bomb.
Hail Scargill.
Long live the whale.

earth.

Have any of your readers
noticed the extraordinary
resemblance Roger^Serpell has
to Popeye?
I wonder if by any chance
they are related?
