Hall to
have
warden
Ex-student
in jail
In February 1982 Haluk Tosun,
who completed his PhD at IC in
1976, was arrested in Istanbul
with 22 other executive members
of the Turkish Peace Association
(TPA). After a period of
detention and a military trial,
Haluk and seventeen others were
sentenced to eight years hard
labour, and the others all
received five years. All 23 have
been adopted as prisoners of
conscience by Amnesty
International.
Amnesty International are
currently circulating petition
forms within IC, and intend to
send copies to the Foreign Office
and the Turkish Embassy. Many
signatures have already added
weight to the action, including
those of the Rector, Prof Kibble
and 140 other IC academics.
Petitions are currently being
circulated in Halls, Houses and
refectories. Anyone requiring
further details can contact

New
Laundry
For
College
The Central Launderette in
Southside basement (opposite
the refectory) opened a week last
Wednesday. The launderette was
completed a month ago but
opening has been delayed whilst a
TV security camera was installed.
This final delay lasted twice as
long as the two weeks predicted
by College Security Officer
Geoffrey Reeves when inter-
viewed by FELIX last month.
The charges are 50p for a wash
and lOp for drying, as predicted
in FELIX earlier this term. All IC
students are entitled to use the
facility, but clearly only those
living on campus are likely to use
it in practice. Opening hours are
10:00am in the morning until
10:00pm at night seven days a
week. In the evening, security,
guards on the Southside main
entrance will allow access to the
launderette after 7:00pm when
the doors are normally locked.
The new launderette should
allow the existing Hall
launderettes in Southside to be
converted to kitchens, which are
desperately needed. However,
the decision on this is one for
individual wardens subject, of
course, to sufficient funds being
available.
The launderette was originally
scheduled to open on 5 March,
but this date now appears to have
been wildly optimistic. Several
subsequent opening dates were
fixed but all passed without the
long-awaited event. The latest
delay seems to have been caused
purely by lack of forethought by
the College Security service. This
means that the launderette has
now opened just in time for the
summer vacation when most
students take their dirty washing
home to their mother. No doubt
the conference guests in
Southside over the summer will
be duly impressed with the
facility although it is not expected
they will make extensive use of it.
A warden is to be appointed to
the Montpelier Street Hall of
Residence for next session. The
decision, taken by the Students
Residence Committee, is in line
with the new College policy of
increasing the number of
wardens.
Montpelier Street Hall was
acquired in 1982 and occupies a
prime site just off Brompton
Road opposite Harrods. It is a
postgraduates-only residence
which accommodates 78 male
and female students in small
single rooms. There is also
accommodation for three
married couples. At present the
Hall is under the auspices of the
Weeks Hall warden and has a
resident sub-warden. The new
warden will live in the Hall, and
so the post of sub-warden will be
dropped.
John Smith
in court
John Smith, the College Secretary, spent seven hours in the
witness box last week at the Lands Tribunal, Chancery
Lane, the "higher court" for rating cases. He was appearing
as witness-in-chief for Imperial College in their appeal, with
the Inland Revenue, against a rating decision made in
October 1980 in favour of Westminster City Council.
The Council have increased the country are looking at it with
rates that the College pay on their
premises from 3'/2% to 5-6%.
Traditionally, universities and
colleges have been rated at the
lower level under the terms of the
'provincial memorandum',
which favours educational
premises over commercial ones.
The Westminster City Council
dispute the terms of this
agreement, and those parts of IC
bounded by Imperial College
Road, Queensgate and Exhibi-
tion Road have been rated at 5%
since October 1980. The College
rate bill for 1982/3 was
£1,967,000.
This is being seen as a test case,
and local councils, universities,
and colleges throughout the
interest. If the decision goes
against IC then other councils
could follow the example of
Westminster City Council, and
universities and colleges would
face massively increased rate
bills. The financial burden would
ultimately by borne by central
government in most, but not all,
cases. All universities, except
Oxford and Cambridge, have
their rate bills payed by the
University Grants Commission.
The total sum thought to be at
stake is £40,000,000.
The case, now in its second
week, is expected to finish before
the end of the month but a result
may not be heard until October
1984.
