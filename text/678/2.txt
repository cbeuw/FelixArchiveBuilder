Union
sexism
Dear Pallab
Would Gaynor Lewis really
not object to a bunch of
drunkards shouting " N o
women..." and "Get your tits
out" at H E R in the Union Bar?
Would she be prepared to take
strong action against the
offenders even if the verbal
abuse turned to physical abuse?
If this kind of incident took
place in a public bar, the staff
would almost certainly ask the
offending drunks to leave; and
in almost any private club, the
people concerned would be
disciplined or at least cautioned
by the club authorities.
After being insulted more
t h a n o n c e ( s o m e t i m e s
threatening) in the Union Bar,
by men in various stages of
drunkeness who didn't like the
way we looked, I and my
friends, like the majority of IC
students, prefer to visit a more
expensive public bar where at
least we can spend a quiet
evening undisturbed.
It's a great pity that most IC
students are put off going to
their Union Bar by the
unpleasant atmosphere that
sometimes exists in it. It's an
even greater pity that our
'President', who freely admits
to being uninterested in
anything outside the Union, is
not prepared to do anything
about this either. It's a total
joke; she is unprepared to take a
stand on matters outside or
inside the Union, so what is she
there for? I totally agree with
the view that she is not a
representative at all, but merely
an administrator.
Yours, in vain hope that things
might improve next year,

Dear Editor
1 would like to express my
disgust at the behaviour and
attitudes of some members of
this Union. First of all, Steve
Bishop and Jim Boucher claim
*that their bigoted demonstra-
tions in the Union Bar are
merely 'friendly banter'. It is
horrifying to think that these
two engineers, products of this
so-called 'Centre of Excellence'
have' received a training here
which will encourage them to
perpetrate the same revolting
attitudes against the minority of
female professional engineers in
industry.
I am disgusted that our Exec
have refused to discipline these
two for this behaviour.
Finally, I am disgusted at our
President, Gaynor Lewis, who
apparently fails to see how
serious this breach of discipline
isâ€”in fact it seems safe to say
that she has done nothing
whatever to benefit female
students during her term of
office.
What we are talking about is
a vehement, personal attack on
some of our students, just
because they are female, by an
all-male group of bigots. While
there is one woman in this
College who wishes to drink in
the Union Bar, she should be
able to do so in the confidence
that she will not be personally
insulted.
M o r e o v e r , w h i l e t h i s
behaviour is allowed to go
unchecked by Union and
College alike, I believe that it
constitutes an assault on all
female students and staff.

Dear Pallab
Whilst not accepting the
factual accuracy of the article in
the last issue of F E L I X , or in
Miss Love's complaint; I would
like on behalf of the Links Club,
and myself, to apologise for our
behaviour on Thursday if we
caused any offense to any
person present in the Bar.
Yours

Look
alike
Sir
Have any of your readers
noticed the extraordinary
similarity between Ian Bull the
President-elect and ET?
I wonder if by any chance
they are related?
Yours sincerely

Dear Pallab
We the Counter Staff feel we
have a right of reply to your
issue, Refectory, 8/6/94. Your
appreciation of the hard work
put in by management and staff
in the kitchen is commendable,
it has not always been so in the
past.
We do however, feel your
criticism of M r M Parsons,
Deputy Manager to be unfair.
He is in fact held in high regard
by many of his staff, who don't
incidentally, come from the one
family in Fulham.
Yours faithfully

Outdoor
safety
Dear Pallab
M r V a c a g o ' s ' O p i n i o n '
( F E L I X 676) is that members of
R C C outdoor pursuits clubs
should be 'forced to gain
experience in a safe way'. Will
the f o r t h c o m i n g safety
guidelines be the nature of this
enforcement, and is the safe
way positively to encourage the
decision 'no, not today' when
confronted with a seemingly
unsurmountable obstacle?
Whilst I agree that an accurate
risk assessment should be made
in such a situation, and its
acceptability judged, M r
Vacago is suggesting that clubs
adopt this almost defeatist
attitude of his: 'If in doubt, turn
back.'
Just as physical endurance
and fitness are increased by
building up the severity of the
exercise and stretching the
body, so in the outdoors, sound
judgement is best accumulated
by making the effort to
overcome the obstacle. If it
results in failure, then the limits
are known, but if success
results, then what was
previously not thought possible
has been achieved, and one's.
own capabilities improved.
University-based outdoor
clubs are often at the forefront
of new e x p l o r a t i o n and
advance, and their established
members have a high standard
of technical expertise, much of
which may well not have been
gained if the decision to 'go for
it' had not occasionally been
made.
He also suggests solo
ventures be discouraged. It
many ways these are safer than
group ventures since, when
alone, one is starkly aware of
one's own limits, and when to
turn back, as opposed to being
