Here is a factual role-playing game for all those
Trolls, Goblins, Elves and Hobbits who are fed
up with the fantasy world and want to try living
the life of an everyday IC student.
If you have never played this type of game before, all you need
is two dice, a pencil and a bit of common sense. On the
other hand, if you are a seasoned adventurer, you will welcome
the opportunity to pit your wits against FELIX Editor-elect David
Rbwe, Gaynor Lewis, John Smith, the NatWest servicetill and
many other 'monsters'!
Read only the numbered paragraphs you are sent to in the
text—reading any others could spoil the adventure. Begin by
determining your intelligence and constitution.
Intelligence. Roll 1 die and add six to the score. This number is
your intelligence. The higher your intelligence, the better you
will fare in Battles.
» • »
Constitution. Roll 2 dice and add 12. This gives your
constitution; a high score enables you to resist attack in Battles.
If your constitution is reduced to zero, you become
incapacitated and you are out of the game. You may increase
your constitution by eating and drinking certain things.
However, you can never increase it beyond its initial value.
Combat. You are frequently asked to 'do battle' with adversaries,
and you are given their Intelligence and Constitution. First, roll
two dice and add your intelligence. Then do the same for the
'monster'. If your score is higher, deduct two from the
'monster's' constitution. If the monster scores higher, deduct
two points from your own. If both scores are equal, deduct two
points from yourself and the monster. Repeat this round until
one constitution has been reduced to zero—this is the loser. You
may be asked to do 'one round of battle', in which case you do
not fight to the death'.
To Start
Write down your Intelligence and Constitution in the boxes.
Also write down your equipment. Atthe moment, all you have is
a plastic Waitrose carrier bag—if you find anything on the way,
put it in the bag and note it down. Write down the money you
have—at the moment all you have is your Servicetill card. If
your reach the Servicetill, you can try to get £50, a chequebook
and a statement. If you hear of any scandal about anyone, write
down their name in the 'Scandal' box.
Now you are ready to start. What is your quest? Look at
paragraph 1 to find out. Good luck!

Your quest is a simple one; you are an
ordinary student at IC and all you want
is a phone. Of course, in orderto obtain
a phone, you will need a room in Hall.
You will probably need some money
too. Arriving at South Kensington tube,
you go northwards up the tunnel. When
you come out, do you go east to
Student Services 23 or west to the
Servicetill 53?
You fight:
John Smith
Intelligence 10
Constitution 8
If you lose, go to 51. If you win, goto 16.
You have selected the most delicious
and nutritious part of the meal! Your
constitution is restored to its initial
value, and* you stride out of the
refectory with renewed vigour. Go to
49.
Congratulations! You have your
Southside Room. As you return to the
walkway, you cannot contain your joy.
Suddenly you see a strange figure
some wav off. He aopears to be yelling
and leaping about. Do you run away 33
(lose 1 constitution point) or go and
meet him 41?
The people at the RCA won't serve you
because you are 'obviously an IC
student'. This indictment of your
appearance is such a blow to your ego
that you immediately lose 2
constitution points. Will you go to
Sherfield 44 or do without 25?
You sit down at a table which has an
attractive mosaic. On closer inspection
you notice it is in fact deeply ingrained
with cigarette ash, tomato ketchup and
green mould. Do you eat the soggy
chips 14, the battered mince beef roll
20, the greyish viscous gray 29 or the
plate 3?
You knock on Gaynor's door and enter
her office. She asks you to sit down.
When she discovers that you want a
telephone, she refuses, explaining that
there just aren't enough to go round,
and that she daren't upset John Smith.
If you know any scandal about Gaynor,
you may try to blackmail her 24.
Otherwise you must do battle with her
28 or try asking her back to your place
11.

John Smith remains silent when you
hint at the information you have on
him. You are terrified, but dare not
show any sign of weakness. Go to 16.
You tell Dave that you know all about
his 'Hotel high jinks'. He turns ashen-
faced and tight-lipped, and invites you
to the upstairs office. He tells you all
the sordid details you need to know
and gives you the FELIX Editor's
pewter tankard on condition that you
tell no one about his activities. You
agree and leave 36.
10
There is a loud crack and an enormous
blue flash. You are thrown to the floor
by a nasty electric shock. Lose 2
constitution points. Storm back to
Student Services and complain 46.
11
Gaynor agrees to your invitiation—lose
1 intelligence point for asking her.
Throw one die. If you throw a six,
Gaynor enjoys your company and
agrees to talk to Jen on your behalf.
She suggests that you see Jen yourself
39.
If you throw 1-5, Gaynor is very
disappointed with your performance.
Her tears upset you so much that you
lose 1 point of constitution. The
following morning you decide to go
and see Jen 39.
12
To get your chequebook, you must do
another round of battle with the
Servicetill. If you lose, repeat this
round, or try thumping it 31. If you win,
try to get a statement 27 or try
thumping it 31.
13
You go home to your room and
immediately fall asleep, exhausted
after the day's activities. At 2:00am the
fire alarm goes off for 30 seconds. Roll
one die. Unless you score a six, lose 1
point of constitution. This happens
again at 5:00am and 8:00am. Each time
throw a die and deduct 1 point unless
you throw a six.
When you wake up, you find that
Estates, with alarming speed, have
painted water-soluble double yellow
lines around your bed instead of
installing a phone. Go to Estates and
complain. 40.
14
You are violently ill and lose 4
constitution points. Leave as soon as
you are fit to walk again 49.

You battle

you lose, go to 51. If you win, raid the
till and find £20 go to 6.
16
He authorises Estates to install your
phone. Go to 13.
17
You enter Arthur's office—he is sitting
with his feet up and he turns to look at
you disdainfully. Then he asks, in his
rather off hand manner, if he can help
you. You ask him for a room. He sighs
and explains how difficult it is to find
accommodation in London (as if you
