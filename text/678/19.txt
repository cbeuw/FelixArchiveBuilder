Caribbean
The Caribbean immediately
conjures up an exciting, exotic
image for most people who also
immediately think "too expensive
for me". Not so though, wttn
airfares from £335 return and
hotels from £71 per person, per
week, twin sharing, you can now
peruse some of Errol Flynn's old
haunts and search out your own
treasure!
In Barbados, as most bars
operate 'happy hours' at different
times, drinks and food are within
your price bracket and with the
wonderful climate and beautiful
scenery you'd have to work hard
not to enjoy yourself.
Although public transport is
very cheap and a great way to
meet the friendly, hospitable
locals, it doesn't cover all the
island so the hire of a car could be
considered. 2 to 4 people
travelling together benefit from
the reduced rates in hotels and
make a small car affordable.
So:

CHECK IN at the Travel
Office, Mark and Janick would
love to see you, and have a good
holiday.
