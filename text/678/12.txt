Three hours later, Gormless was still in
the Baron's office. Pristine had been arguing
with John Secretary-for over an hour and the
Baron was already fast asleep. Gormless had
long since tired of trying to get a word in
edgeways and was beginning to feel drowsy.
Suddenly she was startled by a large white
rabbit dressed in a checked shirt and faded
jeans who ran into the room muttering "Eh,
bah gum, gezundheit electronic cash register
boolery woolery fat fryer disposables
Handbook articles Baron's committee, I'm
late, oh dear, I'm late."
It looked just like J Martin Boolery
Woolery, the FALIX News Editor, but had
two large rabbit ears and whiskers.
"He's not allowed on this committee!"
screeched Gormless, and immediately leapt
from her seat and dashed after him.
Unfortunately she failed to notice two of the
Baron's artisans who had lifted some of the
floorboards and were gazing forlornly into a
large hole in the floor. Before she could stop,
she had fallen in.
Her fall was cut short when she came to a
gentle landing on something soft and furry.
She stood up and looked around—she was in
a dimly-lit cellar with mould growing on the
ceiling.
There was a squeak from her feet. She
looked down, and then jumped back in
alarm. It was an enormous furry rat with
glasses and a big twitchy nose.
"Are you Gormless? O h this is so exciting!
I'm Jonathan Clockwork Ratperson," he
pointed to a large key in his side.
"Pleased to meet you I'm sure," replied
Gormless, remembering her manners. She
held out her hand and shook her new rodent
friend by his ample nose.
"Could you please tell me where I am?"
asked Gormless.
"This is John Secretary's rat infested
dungeon of course!" replied Ratperson.
"How curious! I've never been down here
before. Thank you very much for breaking
my fall, by the way."
"Oh, I'm so sorry for not being softer," said
Ratperson, eager to apologise. "Come and
meet my friend." He pointed to an enormous
revolving cage on the other side of the
dungeon.

Inside the cage a large dishevelled rat sat
crying its eyes out. The rat bore a strong
resemblance to Michael Newperson. "Oh
dear, don't cry, what's the matter with you?"
asked Gormless sympathetically.
"Oh, my tale is a long and sad one, but I'll
tell it to you anyway," he wailed. Looking at
his tail, she thought it was rather long, but
couldn't see anything sad about it. She
thought about it for so long that the Rat's
story appeared rather like this:
Michael P
Newman was
banned from
the U n i o n for
trying to
stop what
he thought
was not right.
He said girls
were degraded
when nudes were
paraded in rude
publications and
on Mines Porn
night. "I'll be
judge, I'll
be jury,"
screeched
Gaynor in
fury, "I'll
try the
whole case
and I'll
ban you,
you dog!"
Now he's
IC's disgrace
and he
can't show
his face
so he
just sits
at home
jerking
off in
the
bog.
Gormless was rather perturbed about the
strong resemblance the obviously fictitious
tale bore to real life. In typical fashion,
however, she washed her hands of the poor
rat's problem and went on her way.
Soon Gormless found herself outside
blinking in the sunlight in a beautiful garden.
" A H E M ! "
A loud and familiar cough made her look
behind her. She was astonished to see an
enormous magic mushroom with a six-foot
caterpillar sitting on top of it, smoking a
rather suspicious-looking hookah.
"And who are you, little girl?"
"Please sir, I'm Gormless."
"I can see that," drawled the Caterpillar,
crossing and uncrossing his eyes and legs
and yawning.
"Hmmm, you must be good for something.
Can you recite poetry? Recite 'You are old,
Mr Munchey' for me.
Gormless began.
BLUNDERland
ou are old, M r Mooney," the Wicked Witch said,
"And your hair has become flecked with white,
Yet when posing for photos, you stand on your head;
Do you think at your age it is right?"
"In my youth," M r Mooney replied to the Witch,
"I stood on my head all the time.
I did so, what's more, without getting a stitch,
So be off, or I'll boil you in brine!"
"You are old," she went on. " A s I've already said,
And have grown most uncommonly fat.
And yet you maintain we are properly fed,
Pray, how do you justify that?"
"In my youth," he replied, "I kept myself trim
Chasing girls and avoiding my wife.
And now, as you see, I'm no longer so slim,
But that's usual at this time of life!"
"You are old, M r Mooney," the Wicked Witch cackled,
" A n d soon you'll be going for good.
Yet still you keep hush about money when tackled,
Don't you think it's a little bit rude?"
"In my youth," M r Mooney replied to the hag,
"I kept the books perfectly well!
So keep your nose out, you impertinent bag!
M y books will cook with me in hell!
All the time she was reciting, she grew
more and more aware that the Caterpillar
was very like the Baron and this made her
confused.'
"I'm afraid I got some of the names wrong,"
she said nervously.
"It was wrong from beginning to end," the
Caterpillar pronounced. "What can I do for

back into the Surefield
"I'd like to get
Building please."
"Have a bit of this mushroom, then. It will
give you anything you want."
Gormless timidly broke a bit off the
mushroom and nibbled it. ,
Suddenly her head exploded and she felt
as if she was flying in all directions at once.
When she got back to normal again, she was
once more in the familiar corridors of power.
Unfortunately, however she was quite lost,
and getting more and more confused all the
time.
She wandered this way and that for a good
ten minutes before she found an office she
recognised. There were two signs on the
door. One said:
'The office of Tweedledong Lark', and the
other:
'Tweedleheadbang Cameroon-Lark's
Office'.
"How curious!" she declared. Confident
she would be dealing with two complete
idiots, she strode into the room without even
knocking. And there they were, drinking tea
and bickering as usual.
"It was my nice, new T-SQUARE!"
screamed Tweedleheadbang.
"And you broke it!"
"I never did!" shrieked Tweedledong. They
were just about to come to blows when they
both noticed Gormless and rather sheepishly
sat down again.
"What can we do for you, Gormless?" they
chorused.
"Oh, I just popped over for a word about
the Citizens' Residences," she lied hastily.
"Sit down, dear," Tweedleheadbang
fetched her a comfy chair while Tweedledong
gave her a cup of tea.
And then, without more ado, they stood
side by side in the middle of the room and
began their report: ^^^^^^^^gtt^k
The Sun was shining in the sky,
Shining with all his might.
He tried his very best to make
The tiles look smooth and bright.
But this was hard for most of them
Had dropped off in the night.
The Painter and the Carpenter
Had walked for many miles.
They cursed like anything to see
Such quantities of tiles.
"If only they could be replaced,"
They said, "We'd be all smiles."
"Ten thousand tons of scaffolding
Were hired for seven years.
" D o you suppose," the Painter said
"We'll end up in arrears?"
"I'm sure," replied the Carpenter. •
His eyes were full of tears.
"Oh Freshers, come and live in Hall,'
The Painter shouted out.
" A lovely single Southside room
Is great to boast about.
Don't fret about the fire alarms,
We'll fix them soon, no doubt!"
The F E L I X Editor looked at him
And scribbled something down;
The F E L I X Editor shook his head
And frowned a thoughtful frown,
Meaning to say, he plainly thought
The Painter was a clown.
But four young freshers hurried up
All eager for a place;
Each so determined to be the first
It soon turned to a race.
They pushed and fought and kicked
and shoved—
Sweat poured from every face.
Four other freshers followed them,
And yet another four.
And thick and fast they came at last,
And more and more and more.
Soon most of them were cut and bruised
And all of them were sore.
The Painter and the Carpenter
Walked miles, I've heard them tell,
Until they reached the derelict old
Fremantle Hotel.
And all the little freshers stopped
And one rang on the bell.
"The time has come," the Painter said,
"To stop and have a nap.
And talk of roofs and leaks and damp,
And how to mend a tap.
And why the rent here is so high
When all agree it's crap."
"But wait a bit," the freshers squeaked.
Turning a little grey,
"We can't move in to this old dump,
No matter what you say!"
"The sun's come out," the Painter said,
"Oh, what a lovely day!"
"It seems a shame," the Painter said,
"To play them such a trick,
After we brought them out so far
And made them trot so quick
The Carpenter said nothing but

While they were talking, Gormless had
wandered over to the window and seen some
sort of sherry party going on in the garden
below. At last, something normal and
reassuring after all those confusing
adventures! A s soon as they had finished, she
thanked them hurriedly and ran out and
down the stairs.
Soon she was back in the garden, and
there she saw the strangest group of people
she had seen that day. Somebody who could
have been Pissmore's twin brother, but wore
a top hat, and another big rabbit who was
similar to Sawn Off were both trying to stuff a
hippo into a teapot. Around them lay the
remains of a picnic, but there was still a half-
full bottle of sherry left. Gormless licked her
lips.
"Oi! And who might you be, to be sure?"
the Pissmore lookalike shouted belligerently.
"I'm Gormless," she replied.
"Begorrah, you'll be allroight with us then!
Oi'm the Mad Oirish Bookie, dis is the Mad
Oirish March Hare and dts-" he poked the
hippo, "is the hippo. W A K E UP Y O U STUPID
COW!!" he bellowed in the hippo's ear.
"Please, Mr Bookie, I'm ever so thirsty."
"Get some o' the hard stuff down your
throat," he said, offering her some sherry.
Gormless helped herself greedily.
But something was wrong.
She was giddy.
Everything was spinning round.
And suddenly, Gaynor woke up.
She was in her office, being shaken by
Sean, Jo Claydon and John Passmore, who
were shouting,
" W A K E U P , Y O U -STUPID C O W ! "
"Get some more sherry down her throat.
That should wake her up!" said Jen.
"Oh, Jen," Gaynor said, "I've had such a
nasty dream that I was in a cruel land called
Cheapskate where Christine was a witch,
you ran the office and Ian ignored me all the
time."
"Oh but darling—you are!"
