THOUGHTS ON I,C. PARTIES
There have been three H a l l p a r t -
ies since the begining of terra.The
time has come t o look at these w i t h
a c r i t i c a l eye.
The f a c i l i t i e s a v a i l a b l e i n
Halls f o r h o l d i n g p a r t i e s are p e r f e c -
t l y adequate. Y e t each of the parties--
has been crowded to the p o i n t o f
unpleasantness.Why do they i n s i s t on
i r y i n s to cram so many people in? A t
T i z a r d the week before l a s t , the
organisers managed t o s e l l three hun-
dred male t i c k e t s (jEd.)jf.o wonder
-rWith women there as well(though by
no means that many) thenplaca was so
f u l l ' that you. couldn't dance,drink or
carry on a normal conversation i n
comfort m
S e l k i r k . l a s t Friday,was not much
b e t t e r ..Their lounge i s smaller and
they o f f i c i a l l y only sold 150 t i c k e t s
but once again there was no room*
I t should be the aim of H a l l ,
p a r t y organisers not to make vast
p r o f i t s at the expense of enjoyable
entertainment.When w i l l they see the
l i g h t ? I f they c a r r y on i n t h i s way
they w i l l become meeting places f o r
