The GentlemanlyStrike
g O FAR AS the majority of students at IC are concerned the
recent strike by A.Sc.W. technicians might never have taken
place. Credit is therefore due to them for providing services
the day before, this prevented a general shut-down of the college.
The dispute did not concern students and it was not allowed to affect
them.
Sennet Shamateurism
TAST WEEK, hot on the tail of " new-'.ook " Felix, there appeared "new
look " Sennet—new blank space and no headlines (very arty!)—with its
" new-look " price—up one penny—and old-look space-filling—that inter-
minably repeated pose of past-President of M l , Tony Berry.
But alas, poor Warwick—along with all his other ULU agent mates—seems to
have been forgotten in this Sennet shuffle. For, in spite of the 33 per
cent, rise in price—far in excess of Brother George Brown's wishes!—Mr.
Faville's share of the sales has dropped frqm one-third to one-quarter.
Each time you buy a copy of the University of London Union newspaper, you
give the local ULU agent a penny. In this way last year's ULU agent in
IC accumulated over £60—not bad for once a week picking up a pile
of papers (delivered to the door), distributing them to sales points in
the college, and collecting the proceeds.
As in so many other things ULU seems to have a false sense of values, for
those other amateurs who do the " real work " on Sennet, writing and
editing, do not get a sou—past Sennet editors have even bought stories
and been dismissed! It has been said that ULU is run by University
College Union also-rans ; occasionally this is not the case—Queen Mary
College is also represented. Their own colleges no doubt feel well rid
of them, so ULU must suffer.
ULU no longer remains a means to the end of meet'ng people from other
colleges. More than ever before, ultra-insular IC is becoming aware of
the other 27,000 students in London University—not on the Malet Street
campus, but actually in each other's colleges. Now ever, the newspapers
are beginning to make tentative links.
Is ULU to survive? Malet Street provides little that the London college
unions cannot themselves offer—the excellent swimming pool is a notable
exception. I think that it will survive, but it will never attain more than
a vestige of London student life.
Is survival enough? ULU may only improve with a thorough spring-clean—
and what better place to start than to reduce the price of Sennet again to
3d. and so removing that source of income to ULU agents. Alternately
if Sennet is so keen to give away pennies—why does not the Sennet BoarH
approach college newspapers with a view to distribution through their
better organised channels?

AS CHAIRMAN OF THE CARNI-
VAL BOARD, I would like to
reply to the rather uninformed and
illogical part of youf last (record
length?) leading article headed "Why
two Carnivals?"
The point, sir, that you failed to
grasp is that there aren't—two, I
mean. There is a Rag Week this
November and a Carnival Week next
May and the two are, intentionally,
dissimilar. The whole emphasis of the
Rag Week will be on outside collec-
tions (i.e. not from students). While
the Carnival Week will concentrate on
big events in the Union every night
with little or no " commando work."
In this way, we hope that, during
the Rag Week people use other talents
and energies to collect far more from
the general public than has ever been
realized by the ill-attended pre-exami-
nation foray in May. At the same
time people will have an unrivalled
opportunity for a " pre-examination
That Lounge!
J\FTER HEARING so much
about the refurnishing of the
lower Union lounge last term,
I fell I had to register a protest
on viewing the finished product.
I was shocked on entering the
lounge for the first time this year, to
find the whole room had been con-
verted into a multi-coloured maze of
spindly objects in which students are
apparently supposed to relax.
The old furniture may have been
somewhat drab in colour but it did
give the lounge the appearance of
a lounge and it was comfortable. The
new furniture has turned the whole
room into little more than a waiting
room. The sharp lines and right an-
gles made by the furniture leave it
devoid of any charm.
About the only welcome innova-
tion is the cocktail bar in the far
corner. If this is the best that the
Union could do, I suggest the lounge
was better left alone. It was a lounge
then.

let-down" at the magnificent functions
to be held in Carnival Week in May.
(For students + profits for charity =
success).
Even you, sir, will appreciate the
increased use of manpower which
this new (split) system realises; so
what about your other criticisms?
The timing—well, briefly, the end of
the Spring Term is not such a bril-
liant idea because of a thing called
" the handing in of course work" for
engineers, which, obviously, you have
not heard of. In fact, the first few
weeks of the session are the only ones
when work burdens are not heavy for
anyone, and of these the week of
Nov. 6th-13th is the only real "blank"
one—hence we show it for the Rag
Week.
You reach other questionable state-
ments, and I have .other retaliating
arguments, but this is long enough.
I would be a fool, sir, to claim that
either the system or timing is perfect,
but I think that they are just about
the best that we can get.
Anyway, we have got them for this
scs-ion and Chris Hocking and his
helpers are hoping to have a record
year. They can achieve this if every-
o.ie who reads this becomes one of
the helpers—all your readers have the
po .ver to do a tremendous amount of
good for some charity. I hope they
use it.

Overworked
\T IS NOW virtually impossible
to pass beneath the Union Arch-
way at lunch times, due^ to the
vast herd of hungry students
queuing to be served in the Snack
bar. Can nothing be done to re-
duce the length of this queue ?
To the best of my knowledge
there is but one lady employed
there for the purpose of serving
coffee, chocolates, sweets, coka
cola and performing the financial
transactions. If this job could be
split somehow, I'm sure twice the
number of people could be served
in any given time.
When are the old sofas from the
Union lounge going to be somehow
disposed of! This would leave more
space for seating in the Snack bar.
How about purchasing more stools or
benches! Seating for at least 50 more
people could be provided by lining
the walls with these. And those ridi-
culous tables, just high enough to
bang your knees on. Cannot some
use be found for them in the lounges
or the halls of residence! No tables
at all would be improvement on what
is at present provided.
There must be other people with
ideas about streamlining these facili-
ties, as well as those in the other
snack bar and the refectories. Let's
hear from-you in Felix, and get some-
thing done.

Mines Mascot
YOLLOWING THE MOD-
ERN tendency towards using
initial letters describing ob-
jects, as their names, might we
not adopt the same technique for
naming tlie new Mines' Mascot ?
Enlarged Replica of Davy's Origi-
nal Lamp would therefore give the
name ERODOL.
Semblance of Davy's Illumination
Tube might, at first sight, also appear
suitable .although—oh dear ! perhaps
not.
