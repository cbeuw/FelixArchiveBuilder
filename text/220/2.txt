listener hears. " Half-listening" often results in missing the
point of the argument, and the listener is, quite accidentally,
given the wrong impression. : 1

Crash goes the
Scaffolding
A CAR RAN into the scaffolding
erected in front of Southside in the
eirly hours of Friday morning, 8
October. The scaffolding had been
erected as a " fire precaution"—to
prevent car-parking and so allow
access by fire engines.
' T H E JAZZ CLUB got off to a really swinging start with a concert
in the Upper Refectory. Two bands were featured, The CH-4
(the Methane Radicals), and the Royal Gardens Stumpers.
The CH-4 began, as a tr:o, with ,

o i lav, 12th October, in General
Studies with her views on the diffi-
culties experienced by broadcasters in
putting their message across to lis-
teners. She pointed out that they
were handicapped by having no
visible audience reaction.
Broadcasters must beware of words
with an " emotional charge." Mrs.
Sto.ks discovered this when she was
first invited to speak on the Third
Programme; the producer was most
upset about the script she submitted,
and severely doctored it.
She spoke of the tribulations of
teachers, to whom, she said, emo-
tionally charged words were lethal.
Chemistry teachers must be happy in
that they use words like " Carbon
Dioxide and " Sulphuretted Hydro-
gen," with no fear of an undes-rable
emotional response from their pupils.
She thought the word " acid " was a
bit dubious, though.
Broadcasters receive a lot of litera-
ture—mainly from less orthodox sects,
nationalists, and others of odd beliefs,
Mrs. Stocks had once spoken out
against colour prejudice, and had re-
ceived afterwards vast quantities of
literature in protest, some of it quite
vulgar.
She concluded by saying that she
found Broadcasting a new and excit-
ing career, despite the difficulties in-

piano jazz.
The following meeting was an un-
official " Freshers Blow," at which
much new talent was discovered. In
fact two new bands evolved almost
on the spot, and it is hoped that it will
not take too much brushing up before
these bands will be able to appear in
public.
In all, the first few days of term
were very eventful ones for the jazz
club, and promise a great-year ahead.
