J-fOW DO I.C. STUDENTS LIVE? In this first of a series of
articles Felix attempts to answer this question—in relation to
tln.se living in lodgings, bedsitters and flats both near the College
and at some distance away.
JOHN CAWSON AND IAN WILLIAMS REPORT
Locked
Bedroom
" QRAHAM'S BEEN STAY-
ING here with his girl-friend
all last week"—but we
didn't see his bedroom. He and
second-year Chemist Ken are
sharing a third-floor flat with
Electrical Engineer Rob just
behind the Olympia exhibition
halls.
La:t year Graham and Ken had
diga in Acton at £3 10s. Od. a week—
but tiese were dirty. For the same
cost (' 0 gns. divided three ways) they
now have a lounge-cum-dining-room-
cum-study, kitchen and two spacious
bedrooms. The bathroom they share
with the girls from the second floor.
They obtained the flat through an
agency in just one day, and had the
choice of the four flats in the house.
This one was chosen for its " charac-
ter "—gabled ceiling and sloping
floors—but it had been freshly de-
corated for occupation and was neatly
and generously furnished.
The great thing about this flat is
that the boys have no restrictions—
the beer cans in the dustbin by the
front door testified to a lively weekend
party. Everyone in the house joins in
these festivities, and there is no land-
lord to complain about excessive noise.
Unlike their earlier digs they could
bath when they liked—though only at
times mutually convenient with their
bath-mates. Here, too, they can cook
their own meals, and though partak-
ing at Mr. Mooney's emporia at
lunchtimes, they resort to their own
" poisoning " for breakfast, and even-
ings and weekend meals.
Among the disadvantages, however,
were the £10 deposits for " breakage
and " electricity " and having to buy
bedclothes, cutlery, crockery and
cooking utensils. While life here is
undoubtedly freer, they fear that their
participation in I.C. Union affairs
must this year suffer.
Luxury
For Two
A FRIEND OF Afriendhelped
James to get his bed-sitter in
Queen's Gate. He and an-
other first year Miner share one
room and a small ante-room
which are part of a large flat.
The landlady also has one or two
girls in one of the other rooms.
The rent of £4 10s. per week also
includes breakfast and electricity. The
room is heated by a gas fire which
with the gas ring, operates off a slot-
meter.
The room has been recently re-
decorated and is well furnished. A
reasonable number of bookcases and
tables are in the room and the land-
lady, who fancies herself as an in-
terior decorator, has drawn up
schemes for additional elaborate fur-
nishings.
They may hold parties if they want
to, provided that they are infrequent
and that their " broad-minded " land-
lady is given adequate warning. Nor-
mally, however, their guests have to
be out by eleven.
As they are living so close to col-
lege they will be able to lake a
reasonable part in Union life unlike
the others that we have interviewed.
If one fails to get into hall, as
James did, it is difficult to see how
one could live much closer to college
—and this place has the added
advantage of a system of emergency
lighting. A form of paraffin lamp,
rarely seen outside the tropics resides
on the mantle-piece. Kept in a high
state of polish, with its brass gleam-
ing, all the lamp lacks is a mantle.
Shared
Sink
CTUART, A SECOND YEAR
Civil Engineering student, is
sharing a flat with a mining
student Their flat consists of
two rooms. They have one bed-
room and a living room on the
second floor, over a shop, in East
Sheen.
In the living room there is a small
electric cooker running off a slot meter,
but there is no running water in the
flat. For this they have to go to the
bathroom or kitchen sink which they
share wtih their garrulous landlady.
The landlady is an ex-newspaper
correspondent with a chip on her
shoulder. Every time they want to
leave the flat they have to pass
through hers, where they are more
than likely to be caught for a long
discourse on the state of the Church.
Every visitor is almost certain to be
detained, on one occasion we were
hauled into her room and kept for an
hour under the impression that Stuart
was out.
When they moved in the place was
like a pig-sty, knee-deep in old comics
and washing-up. It took six hours to
clean. Once they returned to find
