CALL FOR
OF TRADE
BOARD
ENQUIRY
AN ENQUIRY called by the
Greater London Confedera-
tion of Students into the
affairs of The London Students
Carnival published its report last
Tuesday. This stated that after
starting the year withr £2,053 it
ended the year £916 " in the red."
A firm of accountants said that in
their opinion the books of accounts
had not been properly kept. They
went on to say that they had been
unable to obtain all the information
necessary for their account.
Roger Lyons, last year's president
of University College, has called for
a Board of Trade enquiry into the
affairs of London Students Carnival
Ltd.
The 20-year old ex-chairman of
L.S.C-, David Goldschmidt told the
Daily Express :—
" We have nothing to fear from any
enquiry. We lost money because
Students did not support us."
The new chairman of the comapny,
Max illiams, has repeatedly stated
that the company is under new man-
agement and that he can make a pro-
fit this year of over £5,000 without
any student help.
This is probably just as well be
cause all the central colleges have
withdrawn support from the company.
Even LSE, Max's old college, has
withdrawn officially. However, Beaver
(newspaper of LSE) has come out
very strongly in favour of giving
LSC another chance this year.
Only three times in the tenty years
that LSC has been in existence has it
failed to hand over a substantial sum
to charity.
NEW FOLK GROUP
A NEW GROUP within Folk Club
has' been formed this term to play
" American Style." The group in-
cluding three ex-Wayfarers (Ivor
Grayson-Smith, Dave Lambert, and
Ann Hay) together with Bod " digits
on guitar" Saxton, is to be' called the
Wh .J City Ramblers.
The folk club itself is to hold
weekly informal .evenings throughout
the year in I.C.W.A. lounge to en-
cotrrage formation of new groups, es-
pecially including freshers—it is also
intended to teach thefiddle,mandolin,
banjo and guitar.

Union Jack, floated out into the

Suddenly the body rose out of the
" I'll get you all on Morpry
Thus ended the first Guilds Union
Meeting of term, and the trial of
. Chris Molam. For the trial, the
court-room was packed, K.C.S. and
Mines being represented by Judge
Scott, and counsel for the Defence,
Dickie Gash. The accused, Chris
Molam (theball being lost en route)
was dragged in, de-bagged and placed
on the court bog-seat.
The charge—defection to Mines,
and taking filings from the sacred
Spanner for analysis—was brought by
Justice Howell, a man of great experi-
ence ?t the bar. Thefirstwitness was
Frederick (Adrian Fletcher), one of
the Security Guards. His account of
" activities in an Elec. Eng. lava-
tory, where he and his friend Pushka
found the accused, among tell-tale
dale droppings, while listening to
some Eine Kliene Nach Musick,
proved entertaining. Other witnesses
were an American psychologist, and
a certain Randy Mice-avis.
The defence was difficult to follow,
and the Judge's summing up nearly
non-existant. The verdict was de-
cided by the tossing of a coin, which
gave the right one after four attemps.
Guiulty he was. and Scott passed sen-
tence : " I sentence Molam to hang,
till someone cuts him down, and I
sentence Guilds and Mines to one
day's hard labour." At this there
were shouts o " Into th pond," but
Scott escaped.
The hanging was in Prince's Gar-
dens. The crowd was satisfied as
Molam went purple, was lowered,
wrapped in a Uaion Jack, and placed
on a bier.
With funereal tread, the procession
set off for th: park, chanting a
suitable dirge, " O-O-Obscene."
Motorists waiting at the zebra cross-
ing joined in thj dirge, but the com-
ments were silenced with " Obscene."
West's Fulfilled Promise
AACHEN JOBS
IT IS HOPED that following ex-
changes of Union officials, twenty
students from Technische Hohe-
schiile at Aachen, and a similar num-
ber from C. and G. will spend a
period working in industry in the
others' country.
The first student from Germany
will be arriving shortly in this
country to work in the automotive in-
dustry (arranged by old Centralians),
and twelve C. and G. men are» already
" fixed up " with jobs in Germany.
The value of such arrangements is
imply demonstrated by the success of
the exchange scholarships to Aachen,
which have been awarded for ten
years, and it is hoped to extend the
opportunities to other countries ;
however, the C. and G. union, break-
ing new ground with the venture, ar«
treading very carefully, and further
exchanges will take time to organise.

By TIM DOE
W H E N KEN WEST was
elected Vice-President of
R.C.S. last term, he promised
that one of hisfirstacts would be
to "pinch the Spanner"; this
promise was realised on Satur-
day morning.
A small group of dedicated men
from the R.C.S. Wooden Horse Club
walked into the Civil Engineering
building at 11.05 a.m. and proceeded
to the third level, and locker 129,
where some kindly Guilds man had
left the Spanner, after the Freshers'
Dinner on Thursday night.
It was roughly located by the work
of Gerry Lincoln, R.C.S. mascot
guardian, who followed an unob-
servant Spanner bearer after the din-
ner on Thursday, and pinpointed by
the reconnaisance party on Friday
night. The system employed was to
shake every locker on the first three
oors, noting the one which made the
loudest noise ; this was locker 129.
At 11.07 on Saturday the apdlock
on the locker was cut, and there fol-
lowed a period of silent worship,
while it was found that the Spanner
as really inside, and not some students
hoard of nickel-lead. At 11.10. the
raiding party left Civils, carrying the
Spanner openly for all to see—a few
lads looked on, but no action wa;
taken, and the getaway van, complete
with two bubble car outriders, disap-
peared in the direction of South
London.
