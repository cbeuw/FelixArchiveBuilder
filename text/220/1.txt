Q N O E AGAIN the newly-
elected Hall Committee in
Southside are faced with the
problem of combatting excessive
noise that emanates from the
Prince's Gardens Halls of Resi-
dence to disturb the adjacent
mews residents.
At least one of the wardens is be-
lieved to be in favour of the organisa-
tion of '* Noise Patrols." Mr. Stephen-
son, the Senior Warden, has suggested
a duty-ofncer-type system run by the
students of the four Halls.
The Hall Committees have also to
consider proposals to keep perma-
nently locked the gates of the stair-
ways leading from the balcony.
They were not consulted over the
plan to lock these through the vaca-
tion as an experiment in reducing
thefts and preventing undesirables
from sleeping about the Halls.
This trial is regarded by the war-
dens as significantly successful. IC
Union President Adrian Fletcher,
however, thinks, " The measure will
not have any noticeable effect. It
appears to me that, like locking inter-
hall doors, it is a rather unnecessary
restriction on people's movements."
Their purpose would be to locate
offending rooms, especially between
1
1 p.m. and 1 a.m., and seek to quell
any disturbance.
Last November Southside was
threatened with the possibility of
being served with a court injunction
by Westminster City Council at the
request of the mews residents which
could have led to its closure.

Technicians on Tuesday, 12

MAX SAYS "GLAD RAG
BALL WILL MAKE £4.000"
A T A PRESS Conference organised by Beaver, the newspaper of
tin' London School of Economics, on Saturday, 9 October, Max
Williams—this year's Chairman of London Students' Carnival—
announced that he expected this
year's Glad Rag Ball to effect a
profit of at least £4,000.
The whole Carnival—due to take
place in 4J necks time—will, he
hopes, give over £5,000 to charity.
This would be in complete contrast to
last year's debacle when LSC made a
£916 loss.
These high hop;s he expressed in
spite of his ow'. p: vious unfortu-
nate experiences in aii, of charity. A
dance he organised at Battersea last
year turned his expected £300 profit
into a £314 loss.
! l his defence il s:iould -,z pointed
out that 300 of the ticket^ were stolen.
Only half were recovered. 1.500
people had b::n expected to turn up.
Only 450 appeared.
Tom McNally, President of Univer-
sity Co'lege Union, taunted Max.
" You i;ill expect the students of Lon-
don to take ;iin> hi'- gamble on this
year's Carnival."
However, last year's Glad Rag Ball
made a profit of £2.500. But this was.
the sole organised event not to appear
in the red.
IC and King's College have been
joined in their official boycott of
LSC by UC, Westfield College. Gold-
smith's College, Avery Hill Training
College and LSE. It is rumoured
that Battersea and Chelsea Colleges
also will not support it this year.
Meanwhile, it remains in doubt
whether the London Carnival will be
allowed to take place. For latest

lege's first experience of an "in-
dustrial dispute."
The stoppage—called by the Asso-
ciation of Scientific Workers, in con-
junction with other Trade Unions
affected, in support of a national wage
claim and an increased London allow-
ance—was claimed by the Union to
be 90 per cent, complete.
Salary scales for the technicians
are the responsibility of the Univer-
sities' Committee on Technical Staffs.
" It was this body which proposed that
the claim for an increased basic rate,
"to bring the technicians into line with
their fellows in the Scientific Civil
Service, should be referred to arbi-
tration.
This the Unions rejected, on the
grounds that " it did not amount to
a serious attempt at negotiation."
However. Londoft allowances are the
concern of the University, and the
technicians are pressing for a tem-
porary London weighting pend-
ing the outcome of the national nego-
tiations, over and above the perma-
nent £40—£60 p.a. weighting, backr
dated to August, already offered.
There were 90 pickets at main en-
trances to the College until 10.15
when they went by bus to the Senate
House to join a protest march by 400
technicians from other colleges.
The strike was said to be practically
complete in Mines, Botany, Zoology,
PhyUlct, and Civil and .Mechanical
Engineering. Least support was found
in Electrical Engineering and Inor-
ganic Chemistry.
Support was also given by experi-
mental officers in Civil, maintenance
electricians working for a contracting
firm who refused to enter the prem-
ises, and a lorry driver who refused
to make a delivery. A professor
sent the technicians a telegram of en-
couragement.
•Many strikers apparently made
efforts to avoid inconveniencing the
students and teaching staff of the Col-
!
ege by leaving work prepared the day
i>efore. Together with the fact that
experimental officers and technical
assistants were not affected, this ex-
plains why most departments func-
tioned normally on Tuesday, without
the 320 technicians.
Professor Rogers of Birkbeck Col-
lege ha* (jioposea that his students of
industrial psychology should, as one
of many exercises, investigate this
gentlemanly strike during the coming
year. The A.Sc.W. ask us to point
out that Dr. Rogers wants to investi-
gate the dispute, and not the parties
to it!
