that their landlady and her spoilt son
had moved with the television into
the flat, presumably because it was
cleaner than their hole.
They found the place from an ad-
vertisement, in a shop window at the
end of a long trail. Although it is
supposed to be furnished they had to
supply their own bedclothes, crockery
and cooking utensils. The furniture
that was supplied is meagrely scattered
throughout the two rooms. Storage
space, cupboards and bookcases are
conspicuous by their absence.
Stuart has a car which they use to
get in to college in the morning. The
journey takes them about three
quarters of an hour but parking is no
problem in East Sheen—there is
always room to park in the dark alley
way that serves as a street.
They hope that they will be able
to find a better place in the next
month that will enable them to move
away from this flat where they even
have to wait to midnight to do their
washing up in freedom.

In the table we have attempted to draw some comparisons, with
regard especially to costs, of the respective forms of living. For
laundry we have assessed 3/- as an approximate Launderette charge
for a week's washing. Travel costs are listed separately as, in most
cases, these may be reclaimed from the students award-giving body.

friends in to tea, but not up
to bed," is the attitude of
Trevor's landlord to a boys' fav-
ourite subject Trevor is a first-
year Mineral Technologist shar-
ing digs in Ealing with first-
year Maths and General Science
students from Queen Elizabeth
College.
This was the second address sup-
plied by the U.L. Lodgings Bureau
that Trevor viewed before coming to
I.C. Here he has bed and breakfast,
evening and extra weekend meals for
four guineas plus a sizeable travel
burden—to be reimbursed next sum-
mer.
They work in the dining room and
use one of the two bedrooms as
lounge space. Shelf-space in their
work-room is meagre but is, they say,
more than compensated for in the
bedroom.
Although the landlord is on night-
work, they feel obliged not to hold
parties, which might upset the rest of
the family. As it is it seems that the
landlord does most of the cooking
and housework; but perhaps hi* wife
will chip in more later.
Many extra services are provided.
Trevor does not even have to make
his bed. But laundry costs an extra
5s. per week. Of the four, this is,
perhaps, best for those who are lazy
about eating and domestic chores, or
produce disastrous effects in hornc-
cooking.
But, echoing the thoughts of so
many suburban-based students, Trevor
says, " stuck out here, I don't think
I'll get the chance to do much in the
Union " The last tube leaves South
Kensington about 12.30 and the all-
night buses ai£ infrequent. Their own
entertainment is on tap, however, for
one can play the piano, and that very
instrument stands proudly by the
dining room door.
