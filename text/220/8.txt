Visit
by PAUL ROGERS
NEXT MONTH, IMPERIAL COL-
LEGE UNION will once again
play host to a draculatory expe-
dition cunningly disguised as a Blood
Doning Unit from the National Blood
Transfusion Service. For three days,
from November 22nd to 24th, vast
numbers of willing students wi|l avail
themselves of the offer of free cups of
tea (in exchange for a pint of blood).
I.C. has a good record in this field
and last year we parted with 483
pints. Our aim this time is to top
the 500 mark. Will you help to do
this? If you have not done it before,
will you please fill in a form next
week, getting parental consent if
under 21. The forms will be available
in all departments from next Tuesday.
Help is urgently required with pub-
licity and also a few people are
needed to help set up the equipment
on Monday, November 22nd and to
take it down again on Wednesday,
November 24th. If you are willing
to help with either job would you call
in at Chem. Eng. Room 105 on
Thursday 21st October at 5.30 p.m.
(i.e. tomorrow).
SICILY
At Castroreale. near Messina, we
have selected a tourist village for
our 1966 Anglo-Italian Centre
for young people. The village is
situated by the sea within easy
reach of the main tourist resorts,
like Taormina or the Aeolian
Islands, and in an ideal geogra-
phical position for excursions to
sites of Archaeological interest.
A fortnight there at the beginning
of September will cost 49 Gns. by
air and on full board basis.
For an additional 4 Gns. you can
have 20 hours tuition in Italian.
This holiday is also being widely
advertised among North Italian
University Students.
