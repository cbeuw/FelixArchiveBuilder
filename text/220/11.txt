MORE TIME
TO SETTLE
L.S.E. 2—LCI.
Q N WEDNESDAY, 13th October, thefirsttwo league teams visited
Berrylands to play L.S.E., this being the first game of the season
there was some apprehension as to how the team would combine,
particularly th: forward line which contained two Freshmen.
The game started at a very fast pace, the I ...S.I-:, half-backs being quick
to get to grips with the I.C. forwards, so much so that I.C. saw little or nothing
of the I ...S.I-., goal. Slack covering gave I ..S.I . their first goal when a through
ball towards the left hand post was allowed to be deflected to the ins'.de-left
who promptly lashed it past Wojtoiwicz, giving him no chance.
After this early setback I.C. pulled
themselves together and the exchanges
were about equal, in particular Hunt
and Moreland strove manfully in
midfield, but the forwards still failed
to capitalise on this and did not look
like scoring.
The L.S.E. second goal came as a
surprise when a cross from the right
to the far post was turned into the
net from close range.
revival
After the interval I.C. came more
into the game. Against a tiring L.S.E.
defence the forwards, in particular
Eastell and Luxton, started to shine,
and it came as no surprise when I.C.
reduced the arrears. An Eastell shot
was desperately pushed out by the
keeper to Widelski who miraculously
screwed in the ball from an almost
impossible angle. Although I.C. tried
every trick they knew, they could
not equalise and L.S.E. ran out win-
ners.
This being the first match of the
season the teams performance was by
no means disheartening and future
hopes look bright.

CROWDED COURTS
gADMlNTON is one of the sports at which I.C. leads the way;
both our first and mixed teams are holders of their U.L. league
cups. All the more the pity then that we have no badminton
courts.
There is the gym, of course, but with fifty freshers signing on this year one
court is not much use. The position will be better from next week as
they have obtained the use of Nine Elms public baths but that is only
once a week and no substitute for our own courts near college. Badminton
courts are planned in the new Sports Centre but that seems remoter
every term.

fight for it
DOWN by the Union Cloakroom there is a notice board headed Boxing and
Gymnastics. It is a forgotten notice board ; the pictures on it never
change and you will see no sportsmen meeting by it. Ever since the
days of the Rectors Cup we have failed, with rare exceptions, to produce
any keen pugilists.
So bad is the situation that Harry May, postgraduate fresher and welter-weight
boxer has joined Bermondsey Boxing Club to find fellow enthusiasts. This
situation, Harry tells me, extends to U.L. where almost anyone willing to
enter the ring can make the team. We must have some people with the
necessary qualities—it would be good to see some I.C. men wearing the
purple vests.
FbLL MARKS to the Cross Country Club for their training day at Rye. It
was an imaginative idea that came off perfectly—the ideal way to encourage
freshers to keep up their sport. _ .

Rowing
""THE BOAT CLUB is looking for-
1 ward to one of its strongest seasons
for a number of years. There's a
large enough intake of freshers to
enable them to float 8 eights, three
more than last year. Helping this
up-swing are two top Canadian oars-
men and we may see a return to the
heights of previous years.
This increase in eights has not been
matched by an increase in coxes so if
anyone has not yet come forward they
are still welcome.
Swimming
With few losses and a good intake
of freshers the Swimming Club are
expecting to keep up their standard of
recent years and to increase the num-
ber of polo teams to two or three.
Three's a Crowd
WITH THE addition this year of
Mike Evans, the All-England
Schools Champion, I.C. now has
three high jumpers capable of clear-
ing six foot—a height sufficient to win
many county championships. There
will be keen competition between
Mike, Leon Hall (college record
holder at 6ft. 2ins.) and Malcolm
Weaver for U.L. and B.U.S.F. places
next summer.

HAVE YOU GOT A GYM
LOCKER KEY? Then give it
back! The practice has arisen of
gym locker keys going out on per-
manent loan with tne result that
the porter was left with only two keys
to give out to people using the gym.
Two keys for three thousand students
is ridiculous and no-one however
often they use the gym has a right
to a personal locker.
Badminton
TN SPITE OF poor facilities the
1 badminton club began the season
in a happy vein. With many of
their old members left the second
team beat Goldsmiths first team by 8
games to 1. A fine win indeed this as
Goldsmiths were near the top of the
U.L. league last year.
Not so cheerful are the mixed team
who, as winners of the U.L. league,
were beaten 8-1 by Goldsmiths last
Wednesday. The team was, however,
a little depleated as the U.L. captain
was not available.
DOWN TO THESEA
SUNDAY, OCT. 6, was no day of rest for the members of the Cross
Country and Athletics Clubs. The full day was spent in train'ng down
on the South Coast near Rye where miles of soft sands and high gruel-
ling sand dune, provided idea training ground designed to give maximum
tiredness in minimum time
Conceived with the aim of introduc-
ing the freshers to the club and to the
arts of training, the day was a great
success thanks, particularly, to the
help of Martin Hyman who travelled
nearly 200 miles and gave up the
whole day to directing and advising
our athletes.
all day
A cottage was hired close by sea
and sand for changing and lunch.
Over lunch there were talks by Tony
Collings on weight training and ath-
letic injuries and by Martin Hyman
who gave his own individual training
methods.
The whole day was spent in train-
ing—relays over those murderous
si id hills, in improvised decathlon,
weight training, five-a-side football
and" to en:l a five-stage sprint relay
over the sands—some will still be
aching by next treshers day.
