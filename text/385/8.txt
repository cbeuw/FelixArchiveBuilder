Entries must reach the
FELIX office by noon next
Wednesday. The winning
solution will be drawn out of
the Editors Hat. The Editor's
decision will be final.
Despite the fact that two clues
were accidentally omitted from
last week's vacation crossword,
several students still managed
to cope with this unfortunate
disadvantage.
Since this particular sheet
of FELIX Is being printed on
Wednesday morning, the winner
of the £3 prize which was offered
last week will be named in this
week's Editorial.
