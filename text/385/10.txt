A few singles in the woodwork this
week .. Percy Sledge: III Be Your Every-
thing (Capricorn)
In the mould of "When a man Loves a
Woman" sung with more style and a b i l -
ity than the vast glut of singles spewed
into the top 30 these days - quality does-
n't seem to count in the 45's market.
T h i s is soft soul at it's b e s t . I t ' s a good
thing that not a l l the real artists have
packed their bags.
Lyn Paul: Love (Polydor)
The Seekers, the New Seekers, Lyn
Paul - it's a l l the same unimaginative
schmaltz. A million songsmlths wielding
but one tune, and a l l doomed to o b l i v i o u s .
It's as originally written as it is titled,
presumably for that 'lucrative' under 5's
- over 50's band of the record-buying
public (someone must buy it). The IB-
s i d e ' s titled "/ Could Get Arrested".
10-4 officer! Unpalatable dress .
Mike McGear Seas Breezes (Warner
Brothers)
From the " M c G e a r " album, this is an
appalling deformation of the Bryan Ferry
composition. If he'd wanted Reggue he
would have written It. Although that's
rather a tasteless effort the other A - s i d e
"Glvin grease a ride" has a rockirf
neanderthallc beat penned by brother
Paul McCartney and with the right ex-
posure could Initiate a few ripples on the
rather mediocre singles horizon.
Ian Morse
Maggie Bell: Suicide Sal (Polydor)
L I S T E N I N G T O this record I cannot
help feeling whether Maggie Bell is
really clear what she wants to do with
her career. T h i s , her second Solo album
since the demise of Stone the Crows, is
a step back- albeit perhaps a more com-
fortable one- to her rock orionated past.,
as opposed to her previous effort and the
attempts to make her into some sort of
Soul Queen. What is clear however, is
that she must get people around her cap-
able of choosing material that Is suitable
for her undoubted talent.
The majority of songs included here
are just average, exceptions being F r e e ' s
"Wishing Well", "Coming on Strong",
written by Zoot Money and former Crows
drummer C o l i n A l l a n , and the Sutherland's
'/ was in chains'. "I saw him standing
there' is definitely given a flat outing,
whilst L e s Sayer's 'In my Life' is a non-
starter. The other material Is barely
average.
The lady sings as superbly as ever
and the musicians involved play w e l l
enough, although Brian Breezes' guitar
lacks its usual cut and thrust of his live
work.
Ralph McTell: El Progresso b/w Grande
Affair-(Warner Bros.)
Gone it seems are the days when the harm-
less M c T e l l was happy enough singing his
simple songs to simple people.
Not content with the 'Sunday colour supple-
ment' zhmuck of 'Streets', with his latest
offering, the man lays it on the line where
he intends his next mortgage repayments to
come from - namely the ever gullible gen-
eral public. T o say this single is an abor-
tion would be an understatement. E l Ralpho
tells us in his best broken-English about
his dark-eyed signorita (with a rose bet-,
ween her teeth), complete with the inevi-
table fanfare of trumpets, castanets and
just about everything e l s e that would make
an ideal fortnight in Benidorm for Mr & Mrs
Joe P u b l i c . C o u l d be this summer's 'Viva
Espana'

Joan Hemingway and Paul Bomecarrere:
Rosebud (Penguin)
T h i s powerful thriller has been trans-
lated from the french by Joan Hemingway.
Laurent Martin a high ranking french i n -
tellegence officer has to deal with the
blackmail of the western governments by
Palestinian terrorists who have kidnapp-
ed five girls, daughters of rich and pow-
erful men. In the words of the cover
"Sehrantz, the anarchist, wanted des-
truction; Hacam. the Palestenian, want-
ed freedom for his people; and five mill-
ionaires wanted their daughters back.
Laurent, secret agent deals with them
all; even the girls." I didn't put It down
until I had finished (4am).

The Way To Dusty
Alistair Maclean
Death
A L I S T A I R M A C L E A N has chosen the
Grand Prix racing c i r c u i t s of Europe as
the setting for his latest book, 'The Way
To Dusty Death'. It flares into action
with the central character involved in a
crash that causes the death of one of his
colleagues. Johnny Harlow (the hero) Is
first acused of murder and then of having
lost his nerve as failure follows him in
s u c c e s s i v e r a c e s .
The pace of the book is fast, the s u s -
pence gripping and the plot superb. I hope
the film moguls do make a film of this
one - its bound to be as big a hit as the
book is . It went straight to number one
position in The Sunday Times paper-backs
Best-Sellers league.
