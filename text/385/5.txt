FELIX S
THIS YEAR'S NUS Easter conference was held for the first time at Llandudno (in preference to Margate) d u r -
ing the period April 7th - 11th. Here we present the highlights of this gruelling five-day spectacle designed to
mirror student opinion nationally. MIKE WILLIAMS reports.

4* ttte structure of the education system.
The mandates listed at the end of the motion
are more organisational in their application
than militant. It shows the typical Broad Left
strategy of approaching problems little by
little, building up a strong base of support
enhanced by good inter-constituent organisa-
tional communication rather than running
headlong into stubborn confrontation which
would make things worse rather than better. It
is this which is the essential root of the
Trotskyist jibe of "wishiwashiness" so often
directed at the Broad Left. My own personal
comment would be that if all the mandates
listed are fulfilled, and all the C J D . ' S co-
operate then fine . But I fear that the mandates
themselves are extremely vulnerable to
Executive complacency (this is really why A l
Stewart was censured over Surrey's rent strike)
and constituent organisation apathy (and we all
know what that means). But with a large
majority of Broad Left amongst its members,
I'm sure the NUS Executive can prove my
cynicism wrong.
The IC Union Delegation all voted FOR the
Education motion .
Debate on the E E C
Thursday llAOajn. (lasted in total
about 2 hours 15 mins).
T H E WHOLE question of the Common
Market struck me as approximately peculiar.
There was never any suggestion that the
conference should debate whether Britain
should stay in or remain outside the E E C ;
the arguments centred on just how the NUS
could best campaign to get Britain out!
Indeed, John, Randall's opening speech
seemed to pre-empt the very idea of an in/out
debate: "But my question tonight is not
concerned with the choice between staying in
and coming out of the Market. My question is
how do we campaign and how do we express
best our opposition to the Common Market."
The substantive motion (one of the
shortest, only two-and-a-third pages long)

THE ELECTION SLATES
A P A R T F R O M a few odd exceptions,
the N U S elections were strictly sectarian
with nearly sixty candidates standing for
the fifteen E x e c u t i v e posts on a specific
platform aligned with a particular p o l i t i -
c a l group. Whilst this tended to help the
delegates' a n a l y s i s of the candidates,
sectarian wrangling, bitching and blatant
slanging often disrupted the proceedings.
A s far as I could make out, the left wing
groups differed from one another margin-
a l l y in their respective analyses of i s s -
ues and principally i n the respective
tactics they wished to adopt in dealing
with the i s s u e s , some being more extreme
than others.
Starting at the extreme left of the p o l -
i t i c a l spectrum we have the Worker's
Revolutionary Party (WRP). A b i a s e d
critique of the election slates offered by
the Broad Left sums it up s u c c i n c t l y :
"No NUS election would be the same
without the WRP Cassandras yelling
about the imminent end of everything. It
is comforting to know that despite our
warts, the WRP will 'unconditionally de-
fend us all from the attacks of the capit-
alist state'.We can walk the streets of
Llandudno in peace: we have nothing to
fear.
In the elections for the top four posts,
the average number of votes cast for the
WRP candidates was around seven out of
a total of about 700 .
Next in s u c c e s s i o n is the Internation-
a l Marxist Group IMG) .Before the elec-
tions, the IMG attempted to form an
a l l i a n c e with other ultra-left groups but
they clearly f a i l e d . Categorised by many
(along with WRP, N O L S and IS) under
the "struggle, struggle - crisis, crisis"
heading, members of the IMG described
themselves as revolutionaries. They gen-
erally commanded less than fifty votes
in each election, but did succeed in
raising enough support to get V a l Coultas
elected as an E x e c u t i v e Committee Mem-
b e r .
On to the National Organisation of
Labour Students ( N O L S ) . T h i s appears
to be a relatively new group on the N U S
scene. The Labour Party E x e c u t i v e did
not, in fact, endorse this slate due to
the apparently undemocratic way in which
their candidates' nominations were con-
trived. They placed great emphasis on
militancy but little e l s e . E a c h N O L S
candidate advertised their slate at the
hustings inevitably inviting contempt-
uous j e e r s . In the election of the top
four posts, the highest number of votes
recorded for a N O L S candidate was
thirty-one.
Next we come to the International
S o c i a l i s t s (IS).
The IS were predictably the strongest
challengers to the Broad left's supremacy
in the elections and so understandably
the I S / B L friction was often manifested.
The section on the IS in the Broad L e f t ' s
widely-circulated critique of the election
slates shows'just how seriously the B L
took the IS challenge for power e s p e c i a l l y
the bid for the presidency by Terry Povey,
a member of this year's N U S E x e c u t i v e .
In the elections for the four top posts
and the four vice-presidencies, IS came
second in a l l but one of these.
Moving on further we come to by far
the strongest group in the N U S today,
the Broad Left ( B L ) . Often smeared by
other factions of the Left, members of
this a l l i a n c e of Communists, Left L a b -
our and non-aligned S o c i a l i s t s were duly
elected to eleven posts on the national
executive.
The B L is generally considered to be
the moderate alternative to the other
T r o t s k y i s t groups.But w h i l s t being the
object of contempt (envy?) for a l l the
other p o l i t i c a l groups, no-one could fail
to be impressed by the amount of prepar-
ation which the B L put into its candid-
ates' election campaigns. The personal-
i s e d 'vote!' stickers were novel and on
the whole, the B L candidates (including
Trevor P h i l l i p s ) proved themselves to be
shrewd election strategists .
Further to the right are the L i b e r a l s .
Their joint manifesto "The Piccadilly
Line" was at first scoffed at as unim-
portant. It was the B L who betrayed their
concern about them when they devoted
nearly three pages of their election slates
critique to c r i t i c i s i n g the L i b s (by far
the longest c r i t i c i s m of a l l ) . The flattery
thereby accorded to the L i b e r a l s was not
entirely without foundation because in
the vast majority of the elections, their
candidates tended to come fairly c o n s i s -
tently third. Their presidential candidate,
F r a n c i s Hayden, managed to get elected
as an E x e c u t i v e Committee Member.
S t i l l further to the right i s the R a d i -
c a l A c t i o n Group (RAG). The slightest
mention of R A G at the conference pro-
duced a tirade of jeers, so one can im-
agine the fate which befell their sole can-
didate for President, Andy V a l l e n c e -
Owen . Together with emergence of the
liberals and the presence of the F e d e r a -
tion of Conservative of Students ( F C S ,
who did not put up any o f f i c i a l candid-
ates themselves), R A G constituted the
core of what the left-wing groups c a l l e d
"the right-wing backlash". V a l l e n c e -
Owen polled a mere seventy-three votes
in the presidential election, but narrowly*
m i s s e d getting elected as an E x e c u t i v e
Officer.
Of the remaining unaligned candidates,
only one requires mention: Hugh Latining,
who stood as an Independent S o c i a l i s t
after having a bust-up with the IS. It
appears that IS wanted L a n n i n g , already
a member of the E x e c u t i v e , to stand for a
post other than Treasurer. He refused
and was thus branded a careerist by IS.
Supported by John R a n d a l l (who, when
elected, stood as an Independent S o c i a l -
ist), L a n n i n g pushed ahead and even*
tually succeeded in beating favourite
John Carr (Broad Left) who is U L U P r e -
sident this y e a r .
