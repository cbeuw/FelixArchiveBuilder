F I V E NEW
SOLO P I L O T S
DURING T H E V A C A T I O N .
That makes a total of nine students trained to solo standard
so far this year.
T h i s E a s t e r saw two five-day courses held down at our base
airfield at L a s h a m .There, despite bad weather, including on one
o c c a s i o n four inches of snow, over two hundred instructional
flights were achieved resultinjg
in five students being a l l o w e d
to go s o l o . T h a n k s must be
IC P O W E R E D to an easy victory in the London Championships
at Walton Heath last E a s t e r holidays .It was the first time that IC
has taken the trophy since 1933 and yet the team played as though
the trophy was as much a part of the College furniture as the Queen's
Tower. The first team of B i l l Calderwood, John Mendonca, and E d
Clutton played with breath-
given to the instructors, P a u l
Minton (Civ E n g Lecturer),
Doug Walker (Ex-IC P h y s i c s )
and John Young who w i l l i n g l y
gave us their spare time and
effort.
Our more advanced members
have not been idle either with
two second-year members
qualifying to fly our high-
performance Dart 174.Also
several duration flights were
made qualifying their pilots
for B r o n Z e ' C badges and,
a l s o , at long last, our C a p t a i n
has been cleared for cross-
country flying and aerobatics
T h i s year probably repre-
sents one of the most s u c c e s s -
ful in our 45-year history and
it is hoped that it w i l l continue
with many hours of soaring
during the summer and hund-
reds of miles of cross country
flying done.

F O R IC RADIO
(Continued from front page)
IC Radio prior to this, but they
had opted for the second system
because they were of the opin-
ion that it would not give so
much radio interference. How-
ever, it would appear that IC
Radio intend to comply with
the s u g g e s t i o n put to them.It
is understood that the " l e a k y ,
c o - a x i a l c a b l e " system might
prove to be the cheaper of the
two.
A spokesman for IC Radio
commented: "We are extremely
dissappointed that the Home
Office did not inform us sooner.
Nevertheless, we shall be
looking into the matter".
Further details regarding
this new development w i l l be
available at the campus Radio

held in the I C R a d i o room in
Southside and begins at 6.15pm.
WARNING
Would those residents in
Southside who throw paper
aeroplanes into P r i n c e ' s
Gate Mews take note of the
fact that residents in the
Mews have given a strict
undertaking that they w i l l
take legal action should
this occur in future. The
Mews residents w i l l

taking s t y l e . Despite the
heavens remaining open a l l
day they took the trophy with
record scores and for good
measure by a record margin of
27 shots . O f particular note
was E d Clutton who a l s o took
a gross score p r i z e . H i s play
left many observers awestruck
and few would believe that
such mature power play could
come from a Maths fresher.
The D a i l y Telegraph corres-
pondent aptly described him
as 'a long-hitting golf
machine'. The roles played
by B i l l Calderwood and John
Mendonca were hardly support-
ing and their scores left them
close to winning individual
prizes.
The only side capable of
keeping the w i n n i n g margin
from being much wider than
27 shots was none other than
our second team of Bob A l l a n ,
R i c h Brown, and N i g e l F o s t e r .
No other side was in s i g h t .
Naturally we were a l l
delighted with this result,
particularly since most of us
had left our home comforts in
order to venture down to
sodden Walton H e a t h . A l l the
opposing teams had entered
teams of four of which one
would not count in both
morning and afternoon (this
allows for someone in the
side having an off-day). With
typical boldness the IC
committee only placed three
in each team in the certain
knowledge that none of our
boys would let us down. None
did .
Thus we have achieved the
first leg of the unprecedented
treble we so earnestly seek. I
s h a l l report further as news
comes in our standing in both
the South and E a s t e r n league
as well as our defence of the
University Championships
which we won last year for
the first time.
