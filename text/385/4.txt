T H E NUS Annual Conference took place against a background of rising anxiety
from the left-wing over the emergence of the right-wing personified by the presence of
the Radical Action Group, the Liberals and the bogey-men of the Federation of
Conservative Students. But in the end many of the election pundits were proved right
with the Broad Left sweeping into power claiming eleven of the fifteen Executive
positions being contested.
The conference itself was, at times, a pain in the rear to listen to. The highlight
of the proceedings was undoubtedly the elections where candidates slanged each
other incessantly and raced to see who is the most verbose political hack alive. The
Broad Left speeches were undoubtedly the most theatrical; the WRP speeches were
the most entertaining with every other word "struggle" or " s l u m p " ; but the accolade
for the best speech of the conference must go to Liberal Richard AHanach who had
the conference in hysterics with his dead pan delivery and tongue in cheek remarks.
" T h e Broad L e f t " he said "are a bunch of hot-house plants.We Liberals can survive
in harsher climates"He got a standing ovation.
John Randall's opening speech outlined the four main issue which were to be
discussed viz., housing, grants, education and the E E C . Due to the limitations of
space, it is just those four motions plus the emergency motions which were not
guillotined into obscurity which are covered in this report.
In his very last speech as the President of NUS, Randall paid tribute to the NUS
staff and made a few semi-prophetic remarks about the future. He warned the left-wing
about the emergence of the right-wing. He praised Hugh Lanning (now National
Treasurer - elect) for breaking away from sectarian politics and going independent as
he himself had done two years ago. His parting shot was aimed at the Broad L e f t .
" T h e y may think of themselves as God's gift to the Union, but heaven help us if they
ever consider that the Union is God's gift to them!" Clearly the epitaph to end all
epitaphs.
Debate on Housing
Wednesday, 10.30ajn. (lasted about 70
minutes).
T H E P U R P O S E of the substantive motion
in this debate was clearly to put the problem
of student accommodation very much in a
community perspective. In the words, of John
Randall: "When we speak of the needs of
students in private accommodation we have a
responsibility to speak too for all those who
find their homes in that sector."
The motion itself spoke of the chronic
shortage of housing for all sections of the
population; the fact that there were too many
properties, both private and council owned,
standing empty; the discrimination exercised
by landlords against minority groups such as
gays, blacks etc. The law is being strongly
tightened up to combat squatting, occupations
and picketing. People in Northern Ireland get
a much rougher deal than those living in
Britain.
Did you know that in Glasgow separated
(or divorced) women are held responsible for
housing debts incurred by their (ex-) hus-
bands?
On the halls of residence front, some
Universities are now budgeting for a loss in
residence accounts. The U G C are infact
showing signs of paying for some of these
deficits.
Some students around the country have not
been idle in highlighting the housing problem:
students at Bristol managed to achieve a
moratorium on a l l new office development
planning permissions; students at Portsmouth
succeeded in publicising the irony of office
blocks standing empty whilst the community
was desperate for housing.
Again and again the point was stated that
the responsibility for housing lies squarely
on the shoulders of both local and national
government. Members of a community have the
basic right to a place to live and students are
as much a part of that community as anyone
else.
The motion called for a massive public
building programme; the municipalisation in
the long term of all privately owned rented
housing: the compulsory purchasing (at cost
price) of empty houses by local authorities.
Student unions are to be discouraged from
buying property since it is not their responsi-
bility financially or otherwise.
Shock of all shocks, the main tactic which
the motion called for was Y E T A N O T H E R
campaign ("broadly based," of course and
"involving the student membership'').
Additional tactics include militancy e.g.
occupations and rent strikes. Links are to be
sought with Trade Unions to get their
support. Needless to say, this motion trotted
out of the Broad Left kennel.
The first amendment was put up by the
IMG with support from the IS. It predictably
called for militant action in a more direct way
and was defeated. The next amendment came
from the N O L S . Some how they managed to
work in the line "we must nationalise a l l
finance companies and the 200 top compan-
i e s . " This amendment was thrown out.
The substantive motion was passed
overwhelmingly.
A l l but one of the IC Union Delegation voted
for the Housing motion; Bill Gerrard voted
against the motion.
The Rhetorical Void
Throughout the conference there was
certain jargon which cropped up time and
again. Here is a short list of the more re-
current words:
Careerist: Someone determined to get
elected to the NUS Executive in order to
further his own political career.
Caucus: Group of electioneers of one
particular political hue. Sometimes just
a clutch of people making a nuisance of
themselves.
Crisis: The present economic one which
has been caused by the capitalists.
Composite: To collate all the motions
on a specific topic submitted by the var-
ious constituent organisations and then
come up with one huge motion containing
all the points made in the original
motions.
Hack: An incessant sloganiser (q.v.).
Someone who i s i n c a p a b l e of arguing a
point properly a n d who c o n s t a n t l y resorts
to an emotive, sometimes theatrical de-
livery of a speech i n order to w i n sup-
p o r t /
P o s t u r i n g : S t r i k i n g an i d e a l i s t i c attitude
w h i c h one i n reality i s not committed to

S l o g a n i s e : T o memorise a l l the emotive
s l o g a n s f l y i n g around at the time and
then s p r i n k l e , p r a c t i c a l l y every one of
them into every s p e e c h .
Slump: T h i s y e a r ' s new " i n " word.
F i r s t manifested i n W R P s p e e c h e s . R e -
fers to the current e c o n o m i c c r i s i s (q.v.).
Struggle: T h e h a c k ' s (q.v.) b e s t f r i e n d .
T h i s word w a s so over-used that i t be-
came m e a n i n g l e s s and subsequently pro-
voked much j e e r i n g at i t s mention.
Debate on Education .
Wednesday 5.13p m .(lasted about 90mins)
T H E S U B S T A N T I V E motion was eighteen
pages long and was consequently impossible to
digest in the time available before the debate
began . The points it raised were extremely
wide-ranging — so much so that it lacked any
cohesion whatsoever. For every sane point
that the motion raised, there were twenty others
which fell into one or more of the following
headings: idealistic claptrap; • dramatic over-
statements; cross generalisations. It was clear
that very little back-up research had been done
in order to add weight to some of the claims
under the "conference notes" heading . The
"Conference instructs" section was a wondrous
bubble of demanding, condemning, organising,
mobilising etc etc so typical of the Trotskyist
motions. It was naturally torn to shreds in
favour of the "delete all and insert" amendment
one (co-proposed by ICU) which bore the
distinguishing trade mark of the Broad Left:
slickness .By simply avoiding extremist jargon,
the movers of this amendment gained a clear
advantage and in addition, the clear, cohesive
way in which the document was presented must
have made this motion a winner all the way .
The amendment (later to become the
substantive) said that the expansion of
education since the mid-'sixties has been
mainly in the area of technological and job-
orientated courses and that this expansion has
been designed to produce even more graduates
tailor-made to become part of the big-business
machinery and thus contribute to capitalism.
The system is a very strong one due to the
infiltration of ' 'business interest'' into the
area of education through financing research
and representation on college governing bodies .
This is not in the interests of students, and
moves have been made to try and combat the
system. It goes on to criticise competitiveness
in education (i <
e . exams etc) stating it res tricts
educational opportunities and reinforces the
divisions within our class society. The
'democratic' angle was worked into the motion
by its suggestion that all representatives on
college governing bodies should be elected by
those whom they represent rather than arbitrarily
appointed on the basis of supposed interest or
expertise. Fine sentiments indeed. It also
appears that students who have been prepared
to stand up and criticise their course cirricula
have played an important role in developing
the cirricula. A very serious point raised was
that in certain cases, research has shown that
externally imposed examiners tend to allocate
exam grades in unchanging proportions — a
questionably remarkable consistency each
year. This followed on from general remarks
which criticise the inconsistency of various
forms of assessment which can be detrimental
to a student's academic perspective. Schools
too come under fire as being in general more
interested in achieving a high university
entrance rate than in helping their school
leavers with careers advice etc .
The attitude expressed in the motion was
"that the merging of educational resources
with added financial resources could lay the
foundation for a flexible and expanding system
of post-school education which could include:
opportunities for day release and part-time
education, a great expansion in adult education,
the introduction of re-training and bridging
courses, as well as expansion within full-time
courses." i . e . Let's have greater flexibility
and accessibility . (One failing of the motion is,
however, that it omits to say where the "added
financial resources" might come from). A
G R E A T D E A L O F OPINION WAS E X P R E S S E D
T O S U P P O R T T H E VIEW T H A T T H E C O N -
T E N T O F MANY C O U R S E S A R E B A S E D ON
AND AIMED A T T H E I N T E R E S T S O F
C A P I T A L I S M . So in order to combat this, a
call was made to fight for the democratisation
of governing bodies, to challenge the most
restrictive aspects of assessment; and to step-
up the production of rational criticisms of
courses . On a structural level, a call was made
to sever all links between educational
institutions and big business. The motion
strongly advocated constituent organisations
publishing their won prospectuses which would
highlight academic courses, welfare provisions,
teaching methods, assessment, social life and
the role of student unions (including NUS).
Such prsspectuses would form " a n alternative"
to those given out by college authorities.
In succint summary, the motion lists the
four fundamental issues affecting post-school
today (and proposes that the NUS should focus
its attention on them);
1 .the poor level of finance for education.
2 .democracy in education
3 .the content of education
