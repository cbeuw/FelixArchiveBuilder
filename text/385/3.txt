DO Y O U know that I have used two bottles of ink, several
pads ot paper and much brainpower (not to mention practically
the entire week-end) attempting to write my first (and last?)
article for that infamous college newspaper, " F E L I X " ?
The end of last term saw a new Union E x e c installed at 14,
Cromwell P l a c e (which,
case any of you hadn't realised
i s the " h a n g - o u t " of 200
" y o u n g l a d i e s " ) . In a l l , there
are ten E x e c , members — a l l
of whom play an imprtant part
in the running of the Institute
including being a vital link
between I . C . a n d the rest of
the College. A s you w i l l no
doubt have realized by now, I
have been elected to the post
of President, with my support-
ers a s follows —(let's face it,
when this article has been
published, I ' l l need more than
supporters!):-
Vice-President: Carole Burtt
Secretary: Janina C h i c h l o w s k a
Social Secretary: Sarah Jones
Treasurer: Lindsay Salt
Rag Rep: Lorna Thomas
USK Rep: J i l l McNaughton
Travel Rep: F i o n a Monaghan
Boadsheet Ed.: Catherine G i l l
So now there i s no excuse
whatsoever for any members
of IC to say that they don't
know the " W h o ' s Who" of IF
U n i o n !
T h i s year, in fact, one of
my objects i s to further our
relations with IC.. Let's be
honest — how many of you
know more than five girls from
IF? Those that do are, I am
sure, few and far between, or,
at least, are keeping the fact
strictly to themselves — and
who can blame them?! How
many of you, for instance,
would recognize me?
I realize that I am being
very presumptious in supposing
that of you want to get to know
us anyway! After a l l , one tends
to forget that there Is a small
female colony residing in the
male stronghold of IC, and
although 200 girls won't make
a vast difference to the
situation, It's better that
nothing, isn't it? What do you
expect anyway — miracles?
O . K . t h e n , miracles you w i l l
get!
A r t i c l e seen in the local
newspaper reads a s follows:
In the wilds of South Ken-
sington there have been
reports of strange things going
on. A new discovery has been
made in the celibate atmos-
phere of the world-famous
"Imperial College of Science
and Technology", after endless
research and much heated
argument. It has been decided
to call the new discovery "the
IF girl".
Is it another revolution —
or i s it just another story of
" b o y meets g i r l " ? Don't M i s s
next week's thrilling
instalment!
DEFINING P G
ROLES
A L L P O S T - G R A D U A T E S are In an ambiguous position but
some more so than others. T h i s w a s the kind of conclusion to
emerge from one of several workshop s e s s i o n s at a recent N U S
sponsored conference on post-graduate education held In South-
ampton. Delegates attempted to c l a s s i f y that diverse c o l l e c t i o n of
people holding one degree and
working for another in poly-
technics, universities or
independent research Institu-
tions.

The first step w a s to
identify two end points of a
continuum characterising post-
graduate a c t i v i t y . A t one pole
lie the taught courses which
represent an extension of
undergraduate activity often,
though not inevitably, being
focused on vocational training
rahter than advanced education.
At the other extreme are the
a c t i v i t i e s of those registered
for higher degrees and engaged
entirely on research on a
particular problem. Some
within this latter group may
have a large element of
discretion in the choice and
execution of the work they dor
Others have little or no say
in the selection of research
problems or the direction of
the work they undertake.
Many (but not a l l ) research
assistants share this second
position with a proportion of
those on post-graduate
studentships, particularly those
operating in s c i e n t i f i c a n d
technological areas. Reports
from. conference delegates,
hammered home the point that
there is no necessary connection
between research a s s i s t a n t
type funding and lack of control
on the one hand or research
studentship type funding and
high autonomy one the other.
There w a s clearly some
ambiguity in the minds of many
delegates on the advantages
and problems that might accrue
if a higher proportion of research
post graduates were to be
funded on an employed b a s i s .
While some were keen to remove
the charitable connotations of
the grant system, others felt
that employment would tend to
reduce the research workers'
control over the project in hand.
T h i s issue (among others)
could usefully be debated
among IC Postgraduates a t a
forthcoming meeting of I C P G G
(look out for details). C l e a r l y
the i s s u e s involved a r e not
straightforward s i n c e most
post-graduates,especially those
who bear that label for more
than one year, are engaged in a
complex amalgam of research
contribution, technique a c q u i s i -
tion and broad e d u c a t i o n .

(Collegiate Theatre, Royal Court and Young Vic, April 6th-12th.)
C O N T R A R Y T O e x p e c t a t i o n s , the Sunday Times National
Student Drama Festival is a l i v e and w e l l , and may be living in
Edinburgh next year. While most people were under the impression
that the 20th festival was to be the last, Harold E v a n s , the Sunday
Times Editor, has said that he w i l l do a l l he can to ensure that
the newspaper's sponsorship
continues. A second sponsor i s
s a i d to be " w a i t i n g i n the
w i n g s " , and w i l l certainly be
necessary next year, when a
similar festival w i l l probably
cost its backers £20,000.
For many people, part-
icularly those who attended
last year's festival at Cardiff,
the events of A p r i l 6th to 12th
were rahter disappointing.
Although the general standard
of selected productions w a s
suitably impressive, there was
little to captivate or enthrall
the audiences. Since selection
for the festival i s based
simply upon "dramatic effect-
i v e n e s s " , there c a n be no
guarantee of a balanced
programme; this year s a w a
preponderance of white faces
and bare stages. What little
naturalism there w a s varied
tremendously In quality; at one
end of the spectrum lay a tired
and shallow production of
"The Lion in Winter", w h i c h
only reached respectability
through the capable performance
of Nevin Harris a s Henry II,
while at the other end was, for
me, one of the w e e k ' s high-
lights, namely a faultless
presentation of Athol Fugard's
"People are Living There" by
Bristol University Drama Dept.
Theatre of the absurd w a s
w e l l represented by K e e l e ' s
polished performance of " L e
Piege de Med u s e " by Erik
Satie, a n d "The Chairs"
produced by Aberystwyth, who
transformed lonesco tottering
ancients into a g i l e , w h i r l i n g
dancers.
The F e s t i v a l got off to a
slow start (in an unheated
C o l l e g i a t e Theatre) with a n
adequate but uninspiring per-
formance from Bangor of
B e c k e t t ' s "Waiting For
Godot". It w a s not until the
Wednesday that cheers were
heard in the theatre for the
Drama Studio's brilliant mime-
fantasy "Prufrock", based
(very loosely) on T . S . E l i o t ' s
poem. T h i s w a s an Inspired
collage of scenes: Prufrock at
home, at the cinema, in a
restaurant e t c , each one
delicately yet precisely
executed by a very profession-
a l company (incidentally
featuring V a n e s s a , daughter of
our very own Prof. Ford!)
The elusive (and virtually
indefinable) "Festival atmos-
phere"never really established
itself unitl the end of the
week, when the final perform-
ance of Wall H a l l ' s "Oh! Mr
Asquith" (a play about Suff-
ragettes in a M u s i c H a l l
setting) w a s a s s i s t e d by a
vocal audience who continued
with the show long after the
actors had removed their make-
u p . T h i s w a s followed by the
Bristol Revunions, w h i c h
contained more original ideas
in 50 minutes than in a decade
of Smoking Concerts.
Student writing was thin on
the ground this year, much of
the new work being adaptations.
Most noteworthy were two
plays be Joe Richards (admitt-
edly a more mature student)
and "God, Herbert, Donne and
The Devil" by 19-year-old
Michael Boyd, who described
his work a s a nasty blasphem-
ous, g l i b little comedy.
A c t u a l l y it w a s a rather
pleasant and very enjoyable
sketch about what might happen
if the D e v i l went on s t r i k e .
A s a whole the F e s t i v a l
suffered from its tenuous
nature; with nine plays at t h e
R o y a l Court and Young V i c
there w a s little sense of a
F e s t i v a l Centre. There were
a l s o too many productions . . 3 7
plays in 6 days puts a strain
on even the most fanatical of
theatre-goers.
