10 FELIX
NUS Annual Conference
(Continued from page 9.)
highlighted the loss of national sovereignity
ana the serious restriction of economic
freedom which would ensue. Laws and taxes
acted by the E E C Commission cannot
enacted by the E E C Commission cannot be
changed or repealed by the Parliament at
Westminster. One interesting point brought out
was that students in Norway played an
important role in opposing the E E C during
their referendum. Another was that the
referendum is weighted in such a way as to
encourage voting in favour of continuous
British membership of the E E C .
The argument concerning the " a n t i -
democratic' ' nature of the E E C was deftly
extended into the area of big- business and
the anti-working class British educational
system both of which the E E C would give
sustenance. The 'renegotiations' of Wilson
were branded as 'a sham*.
And yet another NUS campaign is to take
wing. Yet again links are to be sought with
Trade Unions.
Out of the eight amendments, only one
(again from the Broad Left) was accepted.
Amendments 7 and 8 were guillotined by the
time limit on the debate (they were both pro-
Europe); amendment 6 condemned referenda
in general and was thrown out; amendment 4
was tabled by N O L S and tried to inject too
much dogma into the proceedings (it was
therefore rejected); amendment 3 called for
the NUS to remain neutral throughout the
Referendum campaign (this was torn to
shreds); amendments 2 and 1 called for a
' Y E S ' vote and were rejected; amendment 5
called for a "no sharing of 'NO' platforms
with racists or fascists" line to be taken
when campaigning for withdrawal and this
was accepted.
Once again, the campaign is to be "broadly
based .''
The IC Union Delegation all A B S T A I N E D
from voting on the E E C motion.
Debate on Grants and C u t s .
Thursday, 8.22p.m. lasted well over 3 hours
AS IN much of the other motions, much of
the debating during this session was sectarian.
The substantive motion, which was thirteen
pages long, was proposed by the Broad Left.
The first amendment (only three-and-a-half
pages long) was predictably a "delete all and
insert" one from the International Socialists.
After this first amendment was squashed there
followed a total of E I G H T E E N more amend-
ments, only two of which were accepted.
The main motion itself emphasised the need
for a continuing campaign over the discrimina-
tory and inadequate grant system as well as
the cutbacks in educational expenditure and it
condemned the "belt-tightening sympathies
aroused by the Social Contract.'' Several
important points were noted » The Minister for
Education, Mr Prentice, has decided to reduce
the number of places in teacher training
colleges to 60,000 by 1981. Ome point made
which, I understand, is very relevant to RSM is
that a student grant is paid for 32 weeks yet
many students are expected to study during the
holidays. Therefore many students are " f u l l -
time students on a part-time grants". Whilst
vacation study grants exist, they are discretion-
ary awards and can be very difficult to obtain.
A call was later made for grants to be extended
to cover the two short vacations. The govern-
mental annual grant review was criticised since
it considered only the level of grants and not
the basic structure of the grants system.
Apparently some students unions have achieved
some measure of success in the fight agdinst
the erosion of their grants by refectory and hall
fee increases through the use of tactics such
as refectory boycotts, rent strikes etc.
Once again the blame for the education cuts
is put on the shoulders of the right-wing
dominated Labour Cabinet which, it would
appear, by economising on the education sector
is attempting to help out big business. Means
testing received its perfunctory hammering .
A call was made for colleges to incur a deficit
rather than pass on price increases in refector-
ies and halls of residence, L E A ' s and the D E S
are to be asked to take full responsibility for
day nurseries and to finance them.
It seems as though there will be no more
'Weeks of Action'. Instead, the NUS will try to
concentrate simply on 'Days of Action'. There
will be several of these during the first term of
the next academic session aimed at educating
students as to the rationale behind the cuts
and their effects.
The general demands which the NUS will be
making include the democratisation of all
institutions of higher and further education,
the implementation of the NUS grants claim, an
end to cuts in teacher training, no increases in
catering prices and hall fees more frequently
than annually, equal fees for A L L overseas
students.
The tactics which the motion calls for are
predominantly organisational ones. Links are
to be forged with Trade Unions and consultative
liason committees set up. Once again the
identifiably Broad Left tactic of "good
communications" is prevalent. Campaigns and
protests are to be initiated with informative
back-up publicity. Briefing documents are to be
prepared and circulated to Trade Unions and
constituent organisations. A l l this goes to
support the view of one of my Press colleagues
that there exists an old Broad Left adage which
states "We must take the campaign forward and
broaden i t " .
The Trot sky is t groups were clearly not
satisfied with this Broad Left motion. They
argued that much of what was being proposed
had been tried before with "bugger all
s u c c e s s " . The International Socialists lor
example wanted the Executive to concentrate
on the development of mass disruptive action
rather than "pussy f ooling about getting
nowhere". The IS amendment was consistently
couched in terms of criticism of the Executive
and possibly for that reason alone it was
rejected.
Only two amendments were carried: one
related to the closure of Furzedown College,
the other to the exploitation of nursery nurses
as cheap labour.
As this was the last major debate of the
conference, a delegate from Reading took it
upon himself to exploit the impatient mood of
the conference (the debate had already lasted
well over two hours). In proposing amendment
eighteen, he managed to use all the words
which, during the course of the conference, had
become meaningless cliches . Words such as
"struggle", " c r i s i s ' ' , ' ' s l u m p ' ' all received
hysterical cheers and laughter. The amendment
called for the President-elect to present John
Randall and Steve Parry with a box of 'Hacks'
cough sweets as a token of appreciation. The
speaker received a s tanding ovation with
hysterical cheering. Conference then broke into
''For he's a jolly good fellow". The amendment
was nevertheless defeated however.
The IC Union Delagation all voted F O R the
the motion on Grants.
Emergency Motions D e b a t e s
Friday, 19.32a.m. (lasted two hours).
SINCE T H E R E had been a total of
seventeen emergency motions tabled for
discussion an S T V ballot had been held the
night previously to determine the order of
priority in which the motions would be taken.
The first priority was the A B O R T I O N B I L L
MOTION .
The motion condemned the James White
Abortion Bill (which is intended to amend the
1967 Abortion Act) as an instrument which
would undoubtedly reduce legal abortions
and called for "free abortion on demand from
the N H S . " There is to be a campaign to fight
the White B i l l which will enclude the dis-
tribution of a booklet entitled *A Woman's
Right to Choose.'
All but one of the IC Union Delegation voted
for the Abortion B i l l motion; Nick Payne
abstained.
The second priority was the L A N C A S T E R
D I S P U T E MOTION. This motion clearly
outlined the situation which the students at
Lancaster University find themselves in. The
root of the prbblem is historical in that the
University authorities have refused to recog-
nise the students union as a body with the
right to negotiate on behalf of its members. The
authorities appear to be taking a tough line in
•the hopes that if they win then a precedent
for other colleges ana universities to take a
similar line will be set. The motion called for
lots of support, campaigning etc.
The IC Union Delegation all voted FOR the
Lancaster Dispute motion.
The third priority was the V I E T N A M
MOTION. This motion condemned the Daily
Mail and American sponsored airlifts of
Vietnamese orphans and the stand adopted by
the media concerning the situation in Indo-
China. The motion pointed out that the
International Red Cross support this view. The
The motion called for an end to all US military
and political involvement in Vietnam, the
recognition of the Provisional Revolutionary
Government. Resolutions are to be sent to Mr
Wilson and the US Embassy, as well as a
message of support to the P R G .
The IC Union Delegation all voted F O R the
motion on Vietnam.
The fourth priority was the CASH G R A N T S
MOTION. This motion noted the success of
St . Mary's College of Education in submitting
a workable cash grant scheme to the D E S which,
in a complete change of attitude, implemented
the motion called for this tactic to be extended
and supported and was passed overwhelmingly.
The r
C Union Delegation all voted F O R the
Cash Grants Motion .
A i l the other emergency motions were
guillotined including one which was very tongue
in cheek: it called for the NUS to mount a
national campaign of solidarity with the people
of Tottenham " i n their struggle against the
reactionary clique of the Football League
leadership." The motion would have called
upon the NUS Executive to organise a referen-
dum, "binding on the Football League" of all
the people of Tottenham on the question: 'Do
you think Spurs should remain in the 1st
Division?' .

Tangerine Dream: Alpha Centauri (Super)
T H I S IS one of T a n g e r i n e Dream's
e a r l i e r c o n c e p t i o n s (released in this
country for the first time by P o l y d o r ) ,
c h a r a c t e r i s e d by the a b s e n c e of m e l l o -
trons. Whilst there are perceptible
crudities in the production (such as
Imbalance of the v a r i o u s parts), the
score is unmistakeably T . D . , who were
then a raw fusion of m u s i c a l Initiatives
soon to mature and produce such enique
c l a s s i c s as "Phaedra " a n d most recently
"Rubycon".
T a n g e r i n e Dream create a unique kind
of " c o s m i c a t m o s p h e r e " with their music
- only P i n k F l o y d at their most imagina-
tive come anywhere near t h i s particular
area of m u s i c a l s o u n d . Whereas so many
other m u s i c i a n s w i l l search for gimmicky
l y r i c s , a commercial tune ( — the lost
chord?), Tangerine Dream explore the
uncharted regions of m u s i c a l surrealism
by j u x t a p o s i n g differently s y n t h e s l s e d
textures which are decorated with
reverberating tonal c l u s t e r s . The effect
is s t u n n i n g .
Dionne Warwick®:
(Warner Bros.)
Then Came You
T H E M A G I C A L v e l v e t lustre w h i c h
belongs to the v o i c e of Dionne Warwicke
glows with a mature warmth in t h i s , her
latest a l b u m .
The presentation i s much the same a s
it has been in the past: a backdrop of
orchestral depth c h a r a c t e r i s e d by a strong
piano score a g a i n s t which the v o c a l line
w i n d s its vibrant w a y . N e a r l y a l l the
melodies have been penned by the old man
of s o u l , arranger/composer Jerry Ragovoy
who insures that his final product has a
high sheen to it.
The best c u t s to my taste are "Who
Knows" and "We'll Bum Our Bridges
Behind Us"; the former because of the
fundamental strength in the simple triple
time signature and the latter because of
its e x c e l l e n t l y r i c s .
A n o b v i o u s must for DW fans and a
damn fine soul album into the b a r g a i n .
Tangerine Dream: Rubycon (Virgin)
Wispy textures of white noise merge
with a s y n t h e s i s e d background harmonic
c l u s t e r supported by a mellotron textural
base and the latest Tangerine Dream
album p u l s a t e s into l i f e .
Side one is a gem: after blindly
groping into a c l o u d y dreamland with
softly floating concords e c h o i n g in phase,
the m u s i c transcends the mood to become
a tense rhythmic phrase which s u r v i v e s
e n d l e s s changes of texture u n t i l , f i n a l l y
spent, it staggers and fades.
Side two is e q u a l l y innovative, if for
different reason. After a s e c t i o n remin-
iscent an a i r - r a i d , a strong unitary rhythm
d e v e l o p s . Then in s u c c e s s i o n it moves
on to duple, triple, quadruple, quintuple,
s e p t u p l e , back to quadruple and then to
complex triple time s i g n a t u r e s . (After
that I understanably get l o s t ) . A s in s i d e
one, the tension f i n a l l y fades as the
becomes that of an uneasy s o l i q u y .
Tangerine Dream's music is music to
listen to in private - it reaches w i t h i n
one and conjures up many i m a g e s . No
words can do j u s t i c e to this record: you
just have to buy it to appreciate it.
