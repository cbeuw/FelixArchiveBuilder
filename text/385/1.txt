NO LICENCE
FOR IC RADIO
IT WAS revealed last Tuesday that the Home Office will not be granting IC Radio a licence.
Although this is a temporary setback, it is nevertheless a big disappointment to the IC Radio
team who have been awaiting the Home Office's reply to their request for a licence for several
months.
M o r e T r o u b l e at L a n c a s t e r —
F i v e Students E x p e l l e d
F I V E S T U D E N T S , including the Union President, D i c k Soper,
have been expelled from L a n c a s t e r University for their part i n
the 11-day occupation of the campus administrative block last
month.
Of the thirty-three students
originally charged, only three
were cleared by the d i s c i p l i n a r y
tribunal set up to adjudicate
their c a s e s . F i v e others were
suspended for a year, another
fifteen students were fined
between £15 and £30, two were
reprimanded, and a further
three students given one year
suspended sentences .
The students involved are
seeking legal advice and w i l l
be appealing to the three-iman
appeals and equity committee.
T h o s e f a i l i n g in their appeal
have the right of a second
hearing by P r o - V i c e - C h a n c e l l o r
Professor A u s t i n Woolrych.
L a n c a s t e r students are
angry at the severity of the
tribunal's verdict and at a
meeting held on Wednesday
night decided to stage a n
academic strike to culminate
with the NUS-sponsored
N a t i o n a l Demonstration i n
L a n c a s t e r on Wednesday 30th
A p r i l , 1975.
I C U C o u n c i l have passed a
resolution supporting the
L a n c a s t e r students and w i l l
be asked at the next C o u n c i l
meeting to make available
resources to send students from
I C to the N a t i o n a l demonstra-
tion i n L a n c a s t e r . Anyone who
w i l l be able to attend should
contact the President i n the
Union Office.
M E L ( B l a z i n g Saddles) B R O O K S A T I C
S T O I C , the I C Student T e l e v i s i o n Service,
managed to scoop the B B C and other media with their
interview of Mel B r o o k s , the American film director,
during the E a s t e r v a c a t i o n .
Well-known as the director of the immensely
s u c c e s s f u l s a t i r i c a l western "Blazing Saddles". Mr
Brooks is in this country to promote h i s latest film
" Y o u n g F r a n k e n s t e i n " . He had the S T O I C Studio
in fits of laughter with h i s gags and a n t i c s . When
asked why Young Frankenstein was filmed i n black
and white, he replied "Somebody stole our crayons."
Present i n the studio when the interview w a s
being recorded were reporters from the Kensington
P o s t and L B C Radio. They were continually a s k i n g
how S T O I C had managed to arrange it a l l and scoop
the B B C who interviewed M e l Brooks the following
day, S T O I C just smiled benignly.
The programme c a n be seen on S T O I C next
Thursday at 1pm i n the U n i o n , J C R and Southside. It
w i l l a l s o be showing on I L E A Channel 7 at 3.15pm
the same day.

The refusal, w h i c h surprised
many, w a s the result of a
thorough investigation of the
system I C Radio proposed to
u s e . Their findings suggested
that the system of several
separate transmitters, ( i n i t i a l l y
one each on Weeks, B e i t and
Southside), each of w h i c h w o u l d
feed a number of s m a l l induction
loop aerials would cause too
much radio interference on l o c a l
residents' s e t s . T h e s i g n a l
from this source would be
proportional to the seventh
power of the distance away
from the s o u r c e .
A recommendation to I C
Radio to u s e a system employ-
ing a " l e a k y , c o - a x i a l c a b l e "
as a suitable alternative has
been made by the Home Office.
T h i s system would give rise to
