Press Distortion during the NUS.
Annual Conference'.
T H R O U G H O U T the five-day confer-
ernce, reports appeared every morning i n
most of the national newspapers. P e r s o n -
a l l y speaking I found i t most disturbing
to find that many of the reports (and i n
particular those appearing i n the T e l e -
graph, the Mirror, the Express and the
Mail) l a c k e d any kind of real perspective
concerning the fundamental i s s u e s being
debated and the wide ranging spectrum
of student opinion which was being pre-
sented . The distorted scenarios being
churned out by the P r e s s (with the excep-
tion of the Morning Star and to some ex-
tent the Guardian) were disappointing to
say the least.
The most vulgar example occured
when Charles C l a r k e , the National Trea-
surer, was elected to the N U S P r e s i d e n c y .
A t the P r e s s conference w h i c h immedi-
ately followed, one of the first things
which the national P r e s s a s k e d was
"Are you a Communist?"
"No, I am a member of the Labour
Party" came the r e p l y .
"But are you a marxist?"
"Yes" said Charles quite simply .
L a t e r on the new President estirnated
that he was, p o l i t i c a l l y speaking, to.the
left of Government minister Tony B e a n ,
and that i f there were further cuts i n Gov-
ernment spending on education, then stu-
dent militancy on the campus might w e l l
increase . It would appear that that was
a l l the P r e s s wanted to hear for the fol-
lowing morning, most of the nationals
talked sensationally about the N U S being
in the hands of a left-wing extremist who
promised a stepping-up of student m i l i -
tancy. There was p r a c t i c a l l y zero report-
ing on the p o l i c i e s and i s s u e s which had
been aired at the P r e s s conference.
T h i s kind of distortion was exactly
that which had been predicted by Mr
F r a n c i s - B e c k e t t , the N U S P r e s s Officer,
at the Student Journalist Conference held
at Sheffield Polytechnic on April 2nd/3rd:
"Newspapers do not openly tell us
what to think about issues. They do
something much more questionable: they
select what they think the issues are.
Newspapers have the terrible power of
being able to define the parameters of
respectable debate .The omission of just
one issue from a discussion can often
mean that the debate's conclusion wilt
be* predictable."
After seeing the distorted press cov-
erage given to this conference, I am
i n c l i n e d to a g r e e .
A s you w i l l s e e , this issue contains
an inserted advertisement from E n d s l e i g h
Insurance. It i s advisable to read it before
deciding to throw it away for although you
may already have some kind of insurance,
E n d s l e i g h are q u i c k l y becoming extremely
competitive i n the student market. There
are statistics- to prove it!

F i n i s h i n g the crossword must have been
quite an achievement since two clues had
a c c i d e n t a l l y been missed out.

Dear Sir,
With reference to the item
headed 'Horrible H i p p i e s ' on
p.? of F E L I X N o . 383 dated
March 13th, I have the post-
card before me a s I write and
I can assure you i t gives every
appearnce of being a genuine
communication. T h e fact that
the writer gave neither her full
name or address says a l i that
needs to be said about her.
A l s o , she cannot even get cur
names right .The card i s add-
ressed to "The 'Misses' Harr-
ison and Ward", although the
other long-haired member of
our team i s c a l l e d Higgins and
we have no-one c a l l e d Harri-
son .
The ironic thing i s that
apart from two of us having
long hair we were one of the
straightest-looking teams to
appear for a long time! Three
of us were fully equipped with
suits, collars and ties, and
the fourth (the one who "does-
n't even possess a shirt")
was wearing a perfectly decent
sweater.
A s to how the text of this
communication came to be
known to F E L I X , I think the
fact that a very good friend of
mine attends IJC. and that I
wrote to her recently quoting
the contents of the postcard
may have something to do with
it.

Dear Sir,
It i s good to see " F E L I X "
taking an active interest in the
E E C Referendum (Editorial,
April 18), and no doubt there
w i l l be much controversy o n
the subject i n college over the
next few weeks. In particular
there w i l l beposter campaigns,
which brings me to the point
of this letter. Posters at I C
don't stay up very long anyway,
but it was noticeable that pro.
E E C posters put up l a s t term
disappeared, or were defaced,
very q u i c k l y i n d e e d . Perhaps
at this early point i n the
campaign the President could
make a statement about the
" g r o u n d r u l e s " concerning
p o l i t i c a l posters, and confirm
whether removal of rival
posters i s or i s not a d i s c i p -
linary offence.
Yours faithfully
Tony J o n e s ,
Physics 2,
Your team gave us a very
e x c i t i n g game and ran us very
c l o s e , with the result i n doubt
right up to the end. However,
when a l l i s said and done, one
inescapable fact remains.
W E WON!!
Yours faithfully,
Ray Ward
(Member of Hull
University Chal-
lenge team.)
