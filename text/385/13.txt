Endsleigh is your own insurance brokerage, entirely owned by the NUS, totally geared to negotiate special terms tor students and graduates.

Motor Insurance
Our Studentplan Scheme is
specially designed for students, so

because you're at college or
university

'Gradplan'-a tailor-made scheme
for graduates.

can save your money and you can
reckon on a much better service
than you'll get anywhere else.

our 43 Insurance Centres almost
anywhere you go in the country
Travel Insurance
Our 'Isis' schemes have already
become famous as a valuable
safeguard when you're travelling.
They provide total cover for
you and your luggage...and if you're
ill while abroad your medical claims
can be settled on the spot.
That can be vital.

would take you to save enough cash
to do it.You'll be surprised.

can cost as little as £2.50.
