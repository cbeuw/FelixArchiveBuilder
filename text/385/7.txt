T H E S U M M E R T E R M i s , as always,
the term of reflection, boozing, serious
study, boozing, examinations, boozing,
young love, yet more boozy and frantic
last-minute revision. A n unearthly hush
descends upon the College, and worried
undergraduates, laden with books and
papers scuffle around muttering " M u s t
do some work n o w . "
For the Union, it is a time of c o n s o l i -
dation and preparation; there are loose
ends to be cleared up, projects to be
completed, d i s c u s s i o n s to be concluded.
Briefings must be prepared for our
s u c c e s s o r s ; hopefully, s o that they are '
in a better position at the start of their
terms that we were, a n d don't have to
spend half the year on bureaucracy; putt-
ing things in order; finding out how things
work; (then having to change them,
anyway).
"(the Governing Body's decisions
on allocation of finance) ...are
guaranteed to wring anguished howls
of distress from students and staff
alike..."
Everyone anxiously awaits the results
of the Governing Body's decisions on
allocation of finance. These are guaranteed
to wring anguished howls of distress
from students and staff alike; despite the
£465m. UGC grant to universities for
1975-6, the Government has again decided
to chop the education budget by £76m
this time. Yet more evidence ot disast-
rous Government policy on public
expenditure.
There is good news and bad news on
H a l l and House rents . T h e good news is
that the Student Residence Committee
approved the negotiated deal of a 75p
rise in H a l l s , with no change in House
rents. In the present circumstances, I
regard this as favourable, compared to
the position when we started t a l k s . A t
that time we were being asked to accept
rises of £2.00 for both H a l l s and Houses!
The bad news i s that the agreement
stands only for the Autumn term, on the
understanding that a review would take
place only if the rate of inflation was
such that rents could not possibly be
maintained at the new level. There
appears to be a tacit agreement amongst
V i c e - C h a n c e l l o r s that they w i l l increase
rents in accordance with U G C self-
balancing rules, rather than in keeping
with student grants.
"...perhaps the vice-chancellors
should stop victimising students...
and begin to use their much-vaunted
strength...in getting a decent grant
for their students."
/( seems to me that this is a trend
guaranteed to produce frequent (and
steep) rent rises, and with it, the
"spectre" of yet more rent strikes;
perhaps the vice-chancel lors should
stop victimising students, as at Lancast-
er, and begin to use their much-vaunted
strength by getting the UGC to repeal
the unworkable sell-balancing rules, or
in getting a decent grant tor their students
I w i l l be writing about the actual
campaigns brought forward from Llandudno
next week. T h e report of the I C U delega
tion w i l l be presented at the next U G M ,
on Thursday May 1st (MAYDAY!), with
reccommendations on it, for that U G M to
adopt. Watch for E x e c News.
The recent silence of the national
Press as regards student affairs has
been quite deafening. Before the confer-
ence the Daily Telegraph & Daily Express
were falling over themselves to attack
the NUS and to hail the heroes of the
"right-wing revival". Where are they now?
"This makes the position of the
media on students quite clear: attack
them whenjou can - otherwise never
say a good word about them."
Perhaps there is little for the
" E x p r e s s " and " S m e l l y g r a p h " to attack.
Charles C l a r k e , the new President, w a s ,
to the surprise of a l l the pundits, only
29 votes out of 700 short of a first-round
victory, demonstrating h i s wide support.
The major issues d i s c u s s e d were Grants
and C u t s , Housing, Education and the
E E C and the Lancaster dispute, a l l of
demonstrably critical importance and
concern to students; thus the conference
could not be accused of irrelevance. T h e
policy passed w a s , in general, good, and
the position of the Ultra-Left and Right
Trevor Phillips
were overwhelmingly rejected, particularly
on the Education motion.
Perhaps what hurt the Press most was
that the heroes that they had built out of
R A G coordinator, Andy V a l lance-Owen,
and the L i b e r a l , F r a n c i s Hayden, proved
to be equally shallow, incompetent, and
inadequate. Hayden crept on to the
Executive through the combined votes of
the Federation of Conservative Students,
L i b e r a l s , R A G and some of the Ultra-
left—hardly a distinguished array of
supporters. Neither of these two worthies
took any part in the policy debates on
the bread-and-butter issues; they only
took part in elections. It seems that if
they want the support and respect ot
students they must deliver coherent
alternative policies on housing, etc.,
rather than simply carving out careers
for themselves.
This makes the position ot the media
on students quite clear: attack them when
you can — otherwise never say a good
word about them.
T H E A N N O U N C E M E N T of yet another
rise in the tuition fees of overseas students
in universities and further education in
colleges comes a s no surprise to most
people. Events of recent months, particul-
arly fee rises imposed by local education
authorities, and a growing controversy
over the number and status of the 80,000
overseas students in Britain made it almost
Inevitable that such action would be taken
quite s o o n .
Mr Prentice, the Secretary of State for
Education and Science, announcing the
increases for F . E . Colleges on March 18th,
said fees for courses below degree level
would increase by around £50 and that
fees for other courses would go up by some
20 per cent .These increases apply for a l l
students, of course, but since students on
grants have their fees paid by their L E A ,
it Is particularly the overseas student who
w i l l be hit, since most overseas students
pay their own fees.
The rise i s only one of several in
different sectors of post-school education;
perhaps the most notable of the others i s
the Increase in Open University tuition
f e e s . A l l the fee increases are part of the
continuing trend to cut back on government
expenditure on education. T h e results of
this policy have been alarming, and i n -
clude the closure of several colleges,
forced mergers, and the dropping of courses
throughout the country as well as an over-
all lowering of student target numbers, and
a drastic contraction in the supply of
teachers.
These cuts have in general fallen on
those sectors and students least able to
afford it, a s in the case of overseas
students. They have a l s o meant a severe
reduction in educational opportunity for
already disadvantaged sections of the
community, working people, women,
immigrants, and overseas students. It i s ,
of course, no coincidence, that these are
the sections least able to resist such a n
attack effectively.
T h e increase to overseas students repre
sents a s i z a b l e sum. A l l but a few thousand
overseas students in receipt of overseas
Development Ministry bursaries w i l l be
forced to pay it. Mr Prentice admitted that
it would mean hardship for some students,
bu t s a id tha t un i vers i t ies and L E A ' s shou I d
exercise discretion in these cases . T h e
Chairman of the Committee of V i c e - C h a n -
cellors and P r i n c i p a l s promptly pointed
out, however, that was hardly reasonable,
as no extra funds were being provided for
this purpose. T h i s could result in a s i t u a -
tion where many overseas students are
forced to drop out of their courses for
lack of funds — thus incurring an appalling
waste of the student's time, talent and
resources.
T h i s is the latest development in a
recent series of moves which will
question the right of overseas students to
study in Britain, under the same conditions
as 'home s t u d e n t s ' . T h e s e e v e n t s include
press a r t i c l e s , the setting up of a joint
C V C P / U G C working party, speeches, and
evidence to parliamentary committees
c a l l i n g for a reduction in the number of
overseas students (particularly postgrad-
uates) in B r i t a i n . P o s s i b l y the most
significant event is the likely capitulation
of Bradford University Senate, (which has
held out against differential and d i s c r i m -
atory fees for overseas students for eight
years), to " e c o n o m i c p r e s s u r e s " .
The N U S strongly opposes the differen-
tial fees, a n d is preparing to step up its
campaign to repeal them, in conjunction
with the Co-ordinating Committee of
Overseas Students Organisation, particul-
arly during the summer term and at the
start of the Autumn.
It is ironic, however, that the fees
increase may succeed in achieving the
opposite of its aims. T h e financial saving
is unlikely to be great, a s the increase
may cause students to drop out, and is
clearly a disincentive to recruitment .
Furthermore, the a i d to development
represented by trained and qualified
personnel may be nullified by restricting
entry to those overseas students able to
. pay — the wealthy and government-
sponsored. Thus prohibitive fees may
actually negate one of the major benefits
of having overseas students in Britain.
