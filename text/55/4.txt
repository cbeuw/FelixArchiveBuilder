ETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Dear S i r ,
I f e e l I cannot l e t Samuel Peep's "Viewpoint"
i n your issue of November l>th pass without comment.
Samuel Peep's complains that I.C, was once again
s p l i t i n t o two groups on the subject of November 5th.
Kr. Feeps even goes as f a r as to t r y and f i n d someone
to blame f o r t h i s s t a t e of a f f a i r s .
I f e e l that i t i s high time that Mr. Peeps and
also c e r t a i n members of the Bag Committee r e a l i s e d
that I.C. i s a l a r g e c o l l e g e and that not everyone i n i t
has the same views, ideas or t a s t e s ; and that i t i s only
n a t u r a l that some people w i l l want to have a rag and some
w i l l want to go to H a r l i n g t o n .
I remember, l a s t year, members of the rag committee
g e t t i n g up at' the Union Meeting when the arrangements
for November 5th were being discussed and saying that
there would be no support f o r a hop at H a r l i n g t o n .
I was not able to attend the Union Meeting t h i s year
but I understand a s i m i l a r o p i n i o n was expressed. I
went to the Hop at H a r l i n g t o n l a s t year and again t h i s
year and thought i t very enjoyable; and judging by the
number of people who went, a f a i r l y l a r g e p r o p o r t i o n of
the Union thought so too.
In view of these f a c t s I hope that i n future members
of the union w i l l be a l i t t l e more c a r e f u l before g e t t i n g
up at union meetings or w r i t i n g to FELIX and c l a i m i n g to
represent the opinion of the C o l l e g e .
Yours f a i t h f u l l y ,

Dear S i r ,
It has become obvious that the I.C.U. Council i s now
completely out of touch with the feeling among the rank and
f i l e of the College.
It has therefore been decided by the L i t e r a r y and
Debating Society to hold a series of lunch-time debates
to a i r matters -which are of i n t e r e s t to a l l members of
the Union.
The motion f o r 10th December i s "that t h i s House
deplores the attitude of I.C.U. Council towards Rags
especially those on November 5th." The President of the
Union has been i n v i t e d to Oppose t h i s motion.
We sincerely hope that a large and representative
body of students w i l l attend to l e t Council know t h e i r
views on t h i s subject.
Yours t r u l y ,

Dear S i r ,
So b r i e f was the mention of the Commemoration b a l l
i n your previous issue that I am urged to enter your corres-
pondence. This, the major social event of the Imperial
College year i s , I think, an occassion when we should become
eminent members of society able to demand, and get, the best.
For most of us, with a students t r a d i t i o n a l financial, resources
such occassions come seldom enough.
I would l i k e to put the question therefore, was the
uninformed phalanx that seemed to look upon any deviation
from the immediate v i c i n i t y of the dance-floor as a threat
to the safety of the building, quite i n keeping with the
dignity of the occassion? And was i t necessary f o r the
s t a f f to push crates of empty bottles between the tables an
hour before the b a l l ended, i n an apparent attempt to clean up
around us before we l e f t ?
That these incidents, which I f e e l shouldn't have happen-
ed, were r e l a t i v e l y i n s i g n i f i c a n t was I think due to the
s p i r i t of a l l those present and to Ccraldo who entered into
that s p i r i t as w e l l .
I'm sure that everyone who went w i l l look back on t h i s
year's Commemoration b a l l as a great social success, and as
an event to which they must go again next year. Personally
I would l i k e to see the b a l l return to Grosvenor House.
Alternatively perhaps Council can inform the management
of the Royal F e s t i v a l H a l l of what i t should already know:
that I.C. men, practiced i n the art of Nov. 5th rags are
not long to be deterred by b a r r i e r s on the s t a i r s or locked
doors leading to the r i v e r s i d e gardens.

Dear S i r , t
It i s declorable that, i n a college renouned f o r i t s i
"Science and Technology", there should exist such an
i n e f f i c i e n t piece of apparatus as the radio set i n the Old
Lounge.
People who have ever t r i e d to use i t w i l l appreciate
immediately what i s implied i n the word " i n e f f i c i e n t " and
I am sure that students who have borne -its t e r r i b l e
reception as background noise to t h e i r newspaper reading
w i l l also welcome improvement i n t h i s direction.
Here, surely, i s a p r a c t i c a l challenge to the radio
enthusiasts i n the college to show the rest of us that
they are not only concerned with sets which have no
cabinets. Would knobs f o r the controls be -too much
to suggest? We do not a l l carry pairs of p l i e r s i n
our pockets. -
