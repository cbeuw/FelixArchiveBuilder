This year as secretary of the University Rugby
Club and vice president of the R.S.M. Derek Hughes i s
coning to the end of a most colourful university l i f e .
Derek comes from Lytham near Blackpool and was
educated at King Edward VII School where he distinguished
himself both i n the scrum and i n the 3wimming bath. The
Admiralty then entertained hirru f o r the next three .years
where he spent most of h i s time flaying, rugby aSfe :
gramophone records. He came to I.C. i n 1949 i n the inter
year with the idea of taking up physics.but at the end of
two years he reconsidered h i s ideas. The R.C.S.'s loss ^
was the R.S.M. 's gain, f o r he decided that he. was more
suited to the hurly burly l i f e of a mining engineer than
that of a physicist, needless to say a decision about
which he has no regrets. His interest i n the pure
sciences i s by no means dead; indeed h i s enthusiasm f o r
assaying i s remarkable. Nowadays a wealth of other
a c t i v i t i e s have forced him to choose the lectures he
attends with care, but when he i s present he i s so
engrossed that he i s seldom seen to s t i r f o r the space of
an hour.
His main interest at college i s s t i l l rugby, i n h i s
f i r s t year at I.C. he played f o r the U.L. 1st XV; the
following year he was dropped but now he i s back playing
for h i s t h i r d year i n the University side. His popu-
larity i s always high on a rugger tour f o r during h i s -
stay at college he has acquired an unlimited repetoire
of songs and Jokes.
Three years of hostel l i f e l e f t him with a reputation
at carnivals of always being able to produce a r e a l l y
stimulating c o c k t a i l f o r h i s friends, although he prefers
a pint of b i t t e r . At I.C. he i s a member of Council
and has sat on many committees. He has also helped run
the s a i l i r y , f i l m and jazz clubs.
During the l a s t few years he has turned h i s hand to a
•variety of other jobs. As a painter, bath attendant,
cellarman and of course miner he has shown v e r s a t i l i t y ,
le has t r a v e l l e d over much of Iranc*, Holland and Sweden
and incidents during his visit to Norway made headlines
i n the Daily Telegraph. His recent v i s i t to Canada and
the States this summer caused a number of Canadians to
review their ideas of the B r i t i s h . He has decided views
on religion and is not at a l l hesitant i n a i r i n g them i n
any company. His taste in music i s rather wider than most
he c o l l e c t s records of serious music and also enjoys jazz.
When asked f o r any further tastes, he declined, finding him-
s e l f rather embarrassed by the whole a f f a i r .
Among h i s present ambitions are to s a i l round the
world, play g o l f and breed dogs. We s h a l l watch h i s
future with interest.

THE JACQUES ORCHESTRA CONDUCTED BY
DR. E.H.BROWN
T i c k e t s 2/6 3/6 B 3 R
Tliis review was written for the last Felix, but
was not printed because of space shortage. As i t was
composed i n the Exhibition, under the influence and
impact of the paintings, i t has been decided not to
a l t e r i t by removing passages now out of date.
I imagine that the f i r s t reaction of most people,
seeing the appeals for paintings by members of the college
for an exhibition, was to suppose that the -whole thing
would be a complete flop. That was^how I f e l t , but I am
happy to be able to write that a preview of the exhibi-
tion 'lias converted me to such an extent that I shall rush
to the shop tomorrow and buy a palette.-
One hears a l o t about the recreational properties
of painting, and how Churchill and many other celebrities
•turn to i t . The same effect i s found i n Imperial
College, f o r this exhibition includes work by the Rector,
hjj Mr. McDowall (General Studies Organiser), Mr. Tombs
(who works very liard to make the Musical Society a
success), and several professors.
The pictures are i n the I.C.W.A. lounge and Committee
Room B, and one feels that a l i t t l e more space would do
them no harm. Most of the works shown could have been
executed before 1900, but a few, notably by Rex Dadd, are
much more daring. Dr. H. Vfilman of Chem. Tech. has
produced some fine studies of flowers and C.C. M i l l s .. .
shows a good etching" of-Bruges, but i f I was to award
prises I should give them to exhibits 18, 39 and 41.
The standard of the woasks is variable, and one feels
that composition does not
receive the consideration
it deserves. The artist,
unlike the camera, can be
selective i n h i s choice
of subject and can form
his work into a united
whole, replacing inharm-
JL onious details by others.
IFW This i s missing by many
' qjf of the works i n the
• exhibition.
In conclusion, this exhi-
/ b i t i o n which closes Jroday,
,.m ' should not be missed by any-
