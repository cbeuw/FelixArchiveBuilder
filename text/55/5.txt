THE KING AND I - Drury Lane
( G a l l e r y h/- - s t o o l system).
This f o l l o w s a d i s t i n g u i s h e d l i n e of musicals
from the Rodgers-Hammerstein team. I t i s r a t h e r
l e s s noisy and b l a t a n t than i t s predecessor 'South

gasps of i n t e r e s t at the a n t i c s of Bloody Mary.
But i t i s , u n f o r t u n a t e l y , somewhat l e s s v i r i l e .
Set i n the palace of the King of Siam,
the s t o r y , which i s based on the l i f e of Anna
Leonowens, demonstrates the e f f e c t of i n t r o d u c i n g
an E n g l i s h schoolmistress i n t o the Court. Anna
i s e f f e c t i v e l y played (and, s u r p r i s i n g l y enough,
sung) by V a l e r i e Hobson, who moves charmingly
throughout. Roy Grant, as her son, has a voice
not f u l l enough f o r the p a r t , e s p e c i a l l y when
contrasted w i t h the bold s i n g i n g of Timothy
Brooking p l a y i n g the Heir Apparent. Herbert Lorn
plays the King, to whom everything Western i s .

"at c e t e r a , et c e t e r a " . M u r i e l Smith, as h i s
c h i e f w i f e , i s as f i n e as ever, and her song
"Something Wonderful" produced a great deal of
applause.
The b a l l e t w i t h i n the p l a y was an American
conception of the manner i n which the Orient

Of the many songs, " I Whistle a Happy Tune"
and "Hello, Young Lovers" should penetrate the
next few years w i t h ease. And one expects the

very popular and enjoy a long run.

L.U.D.S. Festival of One Act Plays:
'The Man Who Wouldn't Go To Heaven' by Sladen Smith
This was an ambitious effort on the part of the I.C.
Dramatic Society, and Beryl Walker i s to be congratulated on
a stimulating production of a difficult play. Perhaps a
'play with a smaller cast would have been more suitable.
Onthe other hand, the aspiration of this piece i s an
excellent _ sign.
From'amongst the players G. Duff deserves special
mention. He had the t i t l e role, which required a sincere
portrayal, and this he managed well. After a rather
shabby start he was in f u l l voice and vigour, and his long
speech was passionately delivered while he made good use
of the stage to give i t stress and added meaning. R. Mel]01
looked every inch an angel, but though his manner was con-
vincing his voice was not always so. Sheila Taylor,
though embarrassed occasionally by her hands a fairly
general fault - acted beautifully, and indeed was con-
:gratulated by the adjudicator on the evening's best perform-
ance. A f i n e , i f somewhat formal, portrait of a gentleman
of too many leisures was given by Neil Blackmore, while
Ruth Barratt made a beautifully effective nun. There
appeared to be one poorly oast part - that of the lunatic.
This was pure character play and could have been delight-
ful to watch, but R, Eycott, though dressed admirably, was
evidently not adapted to this particular role, and could
not develop^ts_potentialities.
The dress was imaginative and resourceful; and the
lighting, a feat of manipulation i t seemed, well done.
In all, a very worthwhile performance - but why don't more
come along and see for themselves?
