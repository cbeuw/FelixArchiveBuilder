N O F L O W E R S B Y R E Q U E S T
*eaxs that Mcrphy Day was going to become l i t t l e more
thaa the current hooliganism of student rags were dispelled
by a touch of o r i g i n a l i t y from Guilds. 'Bo' arrived at Putney
carrying unknown objects beneath a blue shroud. On a r r i v a l of
about 200 l o y a l Guilcismen the shroud was removed to reveal
•two c o f f i n s , one bearing the i n s c r i p t i o n R.C.S. and the
iother R.S.M. These were carried on the shoulders of none-too
-soberly dressed Guildsmen who lead the procession to the I.C.
boathouse. A debate with the gentlemen i n blue as t o whether
the procession should proceed or not resulted i n a decision
t o go forward - and carried by an overwhelming majority.
Meanwhile, E.C.S. had gathered at the boathouse. Their
a r r i v a l i n twos and threes seemed t o indicate that they did nc
[
not take advantage of the very greatly reduced rates that can
be obtained from London Transport f o r very large party t r a v e l .
B.C.S. welcomed the Guilds procession w i t h a shower of flour
bag® and explosives but by sheer weight of numbers, Guilds
took "The Corner". Here the c o f f i n s were placed f o r safe
keeping and remained there despite several attacks by both
Mines and B.C.S. The lack of success was due to lack of
numbers with the Miners (who, after a l l , should be congratulate^
on having some supporters even after mustering two crews) and
f o r want of the presidents lead f o r theE.C.S.
After some a c t i v i t i e s of a secondary nature on the r i v e r
Guilds, with due ceremony and Boomalackas, consigned the ,
c o f f i n s to the r i v e r - and without being molested. Things
livened up as 'Bo' t r i e d to depart. One despicable character
v i o l a t e d t r a d i t i o n by attempting to throw something i n 'Bo
He was m&de'to r e a l i s e h i s mistake by an involuntary
association with the r i v e r .
On the departure of 'Bo' some made t h e i r way bask to
I.C. but i t was too late i n the day f o r a 'party'. A few
G u i l d smen did'try to demonstrate a method of bringing-down
the c e i l i n g i n R.C.S. but were discouraged by a demonstration
of firehoses - with hot and cold running water.
iThe Say was rounded o f f by a "free" hop i n the
iGjn, which was w e l l f i l l e d , but not overcrowded, probably •
"because i t was on-published. So while the Boat Club
were enjoying themselves i n style, t h e i r supporters I
ware doing so on a s l i g h t l y lower l e v e l ; altogether an
excellent Morphy Day.

V REMOVALS
i Jbottt 4.00 on Thursday afternoon, the yellow three-
wheeler standing outside Guilds became the yellow three-
wheeler standing inside Guilds - on the landing between
the ground and the first floors. Due to lack of. co-
ordination betwaen the architect responsible for Guilds
and the designer of 3 wheel cars, the main entrance into
Guilds was insufficient to allow the passage of the
driving mirror. A large notice advertised that this
marvellous specimen of automobile engineering was for
sale - much to the surprise of i t s owner. It is
rumoured that his audible expression of astonishment
prompted the prominent member of the Guilds staff
accompanying him, to suggest that in future he should
park his means of transport elsewhere. This advice
was evidently taken to heart and by 5.00 the yellow
three-wheeler was again standing outside. Outside the
post-office; not Guilds.'
ALBERT
I r i n c e Albert of the memorial has come in f o r a l o t
of attention t h i s week. We seem to have developed a
f i x e d idea that he i s not properly dressed f o r various
occasions.
On Tuesday, the Rag Comaittee went and ensured that
he w i l l f e e l no i l l effects of the smog that was threa-
tening by putting a large—sized smog-mask on him. This
promptly disappeared with the fog.
Another group has been measuring him f o r a space-
suit i n the past week. I t i s reported that t h i s i s con-
nected with the rocket craze that seems to be sweeping
1.0. at present.

D.HUGHES
F,
EI..IX
This year as secretary of the University Rugby
Club and vice president of the R.S.M. Derek Hughes i s
coning to the end of a most colourful university l i f e .
Derek comes from Lytham near Blackpool and was
educated at King Edward VII School where he distinguished
himself both i n the scrum and i n the 3wimming bath. The
Admiralty then entertained hirru f o r the next three .years
where he spent most of h i s time flaying, rugby aSfe :
gramophone records. He came to I.C. i n 1949 i n the inter
year with the idea of taking up physics.but at the end of
two years he reconsidered h i s ideas. The R.C.S.'s loss ^
was the R.S.M. 's gain, f o r he decided that he. was more
suited to the hurly burly l i f e of a mining engineer than
that of a physicist, needless to say a decision about
which he has no regrets. His interest i n the pure
sciences i s by no means dead; indeed h i s enthusiasm f o r
assaying i s remarkable. Nowadays a wealth of other
a c t i v i t i e s have forced him to choose the lectures he
attends with care, but when he i s present he i s so
engrossed that he i s seldom seen to s t i r f o r the space of
an hour.
His main interest at college i s s t i l l rugby, i n h i s
f i r s t year at I.C. he played f o r the U.L. 1st XV; the
following year he was dropped but now he i s back playing
for h i s t h i r d year i n the University side. His popu-
larity i s always high on a rugger tour f o r during h i s -
stay at college he has acquired an unlimited repetoire
of songs and Jokes.
Three years of hostel l i f e l e f t him with a reputation
at carnivals of always being able to produce a r e a l l y
stimulating c o c k t a i l f o r h i s friends, although he prefers
a pint of b i t t e r . At I.C. he i s a member of Council
and has sat on many committees. He has also helped run
the s a i l i r y , f i l m and jazz clubs.
During the l a s t few years he has turned h i s hand to a
•variety of other jobs. As a painter, bath attendant,
cellarman and of course miner he has shown v e r s a t i l i t y ,
le has t r a v e l l e d over much of Iranc*, Holland and Sweden
and incidents during his visit to Norway made headlines
i n the Daily Telegraph. His recent v i s i t to Canada and
the States this summer caused a number of Canadians to
review their ideas of the B r i t i s h . He has decided views
on religion and is not at a l l hesitant i n a i r i n g them i n
any company. His taste in music i s rather wider than most
he c o l l e c t s records of serious music and also enjoys jazz.
When asked f o r any further tastes, he declined, finding him-
s e l f rather embarrassed by the whole a f f a i r .
Among h i s present ambitions are to s a i l round the
world, play g o l f and breed dogs. We s h a l l watch h i s
future with interest.

THE JACQUES ORCHESTRA CONDUCTED BY
DR. E.H.BROWN
T i c k e t s 2/6 3/6 B 3 R
Tliis review was written for the last Felix, but
was not printed because of space shortage. As i t was
composed i n the Exhibition, under the influence and
impact of the paintings, i t has been decided not to
a l t e r i t by removing passages now out of date.
I imagine that the f i r s t reaction of most people,
seeing the appeals for paintings by members of the college
for an exhibition, was to suppose that the -whole thing
would be a complete flop. That was^how I f e l t , but I am
happy to be able to write that a preview of the exhibi-
tion 'lias converted me to such an extent that I shall rush
to the shop tomorrow and buy a palette.-
One hears a l o t about the recreational properties
of painting, and how Churchill and many other celebrities
•turn to i t . The same effect i s found i n Imperial
College, f o r this exhibition includes work by the Rector,
hjj Mr. McDowall (General Studies Organiser), Mr. Tombs
(who works very liard to make the Musical Society a
success), and several professors.
The pictures are i n the I.C.W.A. lounge and Committee
Room B, and one feels that a l i t t l e more space would do
them no harm. Most of the works shown could have been
executed before 1900, but a few, notably by Rex Dadd, are
much more daring. Dr. H. Vfilman of Chem. Tech. has
produced some fine studies of flowers and C.C. M i l l s .. .
shows a good etching" of-Bruges, but i f I was to award
prises I should give them to exhibits 18, 39 and 41.
The standard of the woasks is variable, and one feels
that composition does not
receive the consideration
it deserves. The artist,
unlike the camera, can be
selective i n h i s choice
of subject and can form
his work into a united
whole, replacing inharm-
JL onious details by others.
IFW This i s missing by many
' qjf of the works i n the
• exhibition.
In conclusion, this exhi-
/ b i t i o n which closes Jroday,
,.m ' should not be missed by any-

Good news for those that like more social activities. "
There is a new Social Club that has come into being last
fortnight and another one will probably be formed in the
next few days. The Social Clubs require a minimum of
20 members for each new club and bothhave fulfilled this
condition.
The Billiards Club was in embryonic form at the end
of last session and has now been fully organised. It
has an »"""»' subscription or 5/-, and will operate
throughout the year in the Staff Common Room, Beit Build-
ing. Ladders for billiards and snooker will be hung up
there, to be operated i n the normal fashion.

UNESCO sponsor a chain of Clubs called International
Relations Clubs, are for the very general purpose of
developing and increasing mutual understanding amongst
different peoples; in most cases, they also help pros-
pective travellers by way of first-hand information on
various countries. This aspect should especially appeal
to members of I.C. who go a l l over the world in pursuit
of pleasure and profession. The list on the general
Internal notice-board already exceeds 20, but many more,
especially from this country, would want to join the Club
and make i t a success. This Club would probably be
started from Dec. 2, when the Social Clubs Cccmittee meets.

ETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Dear S i r ,
I f e e l I cannot l e t Samuel Peep's "Viewpoint"
i n your issue of November l>th pass without comment.
Samuel Peep's complains that I.C, was once again
s p l i t i n t o two groups on the subject of November 5th.
Kr. Feeps even goes as f a r as to t r y and f i n d someone
to blame f o r t h i s s t a t e of a f f a i r s .
I f e e l that i t i s high time that Mr. Peeps and
also c e r t a i n members of the Bag Committee r e a l i s e d
that I.C. i s a l a r g e c o l l e g e and that not everyone i n i t
has the same views, ideas or t a s t e s ; and that i t i s only
n a t u r a l that some people w i l l want to have a rag and some
w i l l want to go to H a r l i n g t o n .
I remember, l a s t year, members of the rag committee
g e t t i n g up at' the Union Meeting when the arrangements
for November 5th were being discussed and saying that
there would be no support f o r a hop at H a r l i n g t o n .
I was not able to attend the Union Meeting t h i s year
but I understand a s i m i l a r o p i n i o n was expressed. I
went to the Hop at H a r l i n g t o n l a s t year and again t h i s
year and thought i t very enjoyable; and judging by the
number of people who went, a f a i r l y l a r g e p r o p o r t i o n of
the Union thought so too.
In view of these f a c t s I hope that i n future members
of the union w i l l be a l i t t l e more c a r e f u l before g e t t i n g
up at union meetings or w r i t i n g to FELIX and c l a i m i n g to
represent the opinion of the C o l l e g e .
Yours f a i t h f u l l y ,

Dear S i r ,
It has become obvious that the I.C.U. Council i s now
completely out of touch with the feeling among the rank and
f i l e of the College.
It has therefore been decided by the L i t e r a r y and
Debating Society to hold a series of lunch-time debates
to a i r matters -which are of i n t e r e s t to a l l members of
the Union.
The motion f o r 10th December i s "that t h i s House
deplores the attitude of I.C.U. Council towards Rags
especially those on November 5th." The President of the
Union has been i n v i t e d to Oppose t h i s motion.
We sincerely hope that a large and representative
body of students w i l l attend to l e t Council know t h e i r
views on t h i s subject.
Yours t r u l y ,

Dear S i r ,
So b r i e f was the mention of the Commemoration b a l l
i n your previous issue that I am urged to enter your corres-
pondence. This, the major social event of the Imperial
College year i s , I think, an occassion when we should become
eminent members of society able to demand, and get, the best.
For most of us, with a students t r a d i t i o n a l financial, resources
such occassions come seldom enough.
I would l i k e to put the question therefore, was the
uninformed phalanx that seemed to look upon any deviation
from the immediate v i c i n i t y of the dance-floor as a threat
to the safety of the building, quite i n keeping with the
dignity of the occassion? And was i t necessary f o r the
s t a f f to push crates of empty bottles between the tables an
hour before the b a l l ended, i n an apparent attempt to clean up
around us before we l e f t ?
That these incidents, which I f e e l shouldn't have happen-
ed, were r e l a t i v e l y i n s i g n i f i c a n t was I think due to the
s p i r i t of a l l those present and to Ccraldo who entered into
that s p i r i t as w e l l .
I'm sure that everyone who went w i l l look back on t h i s
year's Commemoration b a l l as a great social success, and as
an event to which they must go again next year. Personally
I would l i k e to see the b a l l return to Grosvenor House.
Alternatively perhaps Council can inform the management
of the Royal F e s t i v a l H a l l of what i t should already know:
that I.C. men, practiced i n the art of Nov. 5th rags are
not long to be deterred by b a r r i e r s on the s t a i r s or locked
doors leading to the r i v e r s i d e gardens.
lours f a i t h f u l l y ,

Dear S i r , t
It i s declorable that, i n a college renouned f o r i t s i
"Science and Technology", there should exist such an
i n e f f i c i e n t piece of apparatus as the radio set i n the Old
Lounge.
People who have ever t r i e d to use i t w i l l appreciate
immediately what i s implied i n the word " i n e f f i c i e n t " and
I am sure that students who have borne -its t e r r i b l e
reception as background noise to t h e i r newspaper reading
w i l l also welcome improvement i n t h i s direction.
Here, surely, i s a p r a c t i c a l challenge to the radio
enthusiasts i n the college to show the rest of us that
they are not only concerned with sets which have no
cabinets. Would knobs f o r the controls be -too much
to suggest? We do not a l l carry pairs of p l i e r s i n
our pockets. -

the b a l l e t was danced i n a s t y l e we seldom see,

Of the many songs, " I Whistle a Happy Tune"

very popular and enjoy a long run.

L.U.D.S. Festival of One Act Plays:
'The Man Who Wouldn't Go To Heaven' by Sladen Smith
This was an ambitious effort on the part of the I.C.
Dramatic Society, and Beryl Walker i s to be congratulated on
a stimulating production of a difficult play. Perhaps a
'play with a smaller cast would have been more suitable.
Onthe other hand, the aspiration of this piece i s an
excellent _ sign.
From'amongst the players G. Duff deserves special
mention. He had the t i t l e role, which required a sincere
portrayal, and this he managed well. After a rather
shabby start he was in f u l l voice and vigour, and his long
speech was passionately delivered while he made good use
of the stage to give i t stress and added meaning. R. Mel]01
looked every inch an angel, but though his manner was con-
vincing his voice was not always so. Sheila Taylor,
though embarrassed occasionally by her hands a fairly
general fault - acted beautifully, and indeed was con-
:gratulated by the adjudicator on the evening's best perform-
ance. A f i n e , i f somewhat formal, portrait of a gentleman
of too many leisures was given by Neil Blackmore, while
Ruth Barratt made a beautifully effective nun. There
appeared to be one poorly oast part - that of the lunatic.
This was pure character play and could have been delight-
ful to watch, but R, Eycott, though dressed admirably, was
evidently not adapted to this particular role, and could
not develop^ts_potentialities.
The dress was imaginative and resourceful; and the
lighting, a feat of manipulation i t seemed, well done.
In all, a very worthwhile performance - but why don't more
come along and see for themselves?

MORPHY-DAY
Morphy Day, under pleasant conditions of a s l i g h t
following wind, and cajm water, saw Guilds retain the
Korphy Cup and the R.C.S. gain t h e i r f i r s t success i n
the Lowry Cup since 1948. The racing was good and
keen and the standard of oarsmanship augers w e l l f o r
some r e a l l y good I.C. rawing i n the coming year.
The marshalling and start of the Morphy Cup was an
object lesson i n the starter's art and a l l three crews
got away w e l l , C. AKG. i n centre station s t r i k i n g 54 i n
the f i r s t minute to the R.C.S. on Middx. 55 with R.S.M.
on Surrey a point or two lower. C. & C. took a s l i g h t
lead at once with R.S.M. taking advantage of t h e i r posi-
t i o n i n the faster water to lead R.C.S. At Harrods, C. & G.
( s t r i k i n g 30) were \ length ahead of R.S.M. ( s t r i k i n g 28)
with R.C.S. (at 31) z length behind. At t h i s point R.C.S.
began to p u l l up, and at the Crabtree C. & G. l e d by £
length from R.C.S. with R.S.M. a £ length behind. C. & G.
as b e f i t t e d t h e i r experience w e l l coupled up throughout
the stroke, but looking somewhat ponderous about t h e i r
blade entry were i n d i s t i n c t contrast to R.C.S. whose
" l i f e " on the beginning enabled them to maintain a higher
rate of s t r i k i n g and race hard and t h i s covered up d e f i -
ciencies i n time and timing. R.S.M. with two novice
oarsmen i n the boat very wisely allowed themselves to row
at t h e i r optimum rating and so get the best out of each
man. By the mile C. & G. were clear of the other two
crews but along the w a l l R.C.S. began to go up and were
overlapping the leaders by the Boathouses. Prom here t o
the f i n i s h C. & G. r e p l i e d to the challenge and won a very
good race by l£ lengths from R.C.S., with R.S.M. a further
l j lengths away, i a the good time of 7 mins. 44 sees.
The Lowry Cup proved to be a win f o r a hard working
R.C.S. crew who had plenty of l i f e on the beginning and
kept t h e i r blades w e l l covered throughout the stroke.
S t r i k i n g 9, 17, 25 and 33 i n the f i r s t quarter, half, three-
quarter and f u l l minute they were clear of the other two
crews at the end of the f i r s t minute and went on to win by
2g- lengths from C. & G. with R.S.M. a further 4 lengths
away i n 4 mins. 22 sees. A very good time under the con-
ditions.
Malcolm Campbell the R.C.S. non-rowing Captain i s t o
be congratulated on producing and coaching two good boats,
and the two newcomers to the r i v e r i n the R.S.M. boat deserve
high praise f o r racing so well s i x weeks a f t e r the start
of t h e i r rowing careers.
The starter was C.A. Bristow and the umpire R.C. Morris.

Those of I.C. who peer into the gym on Monday or
Thursday evenings are usually either shocked or enthralled
by the display of energy and s k i l l which is sometimes
being demonstrated. The complexity of fencing i s
bewildering to the novice, and even more so to the
President who interprets "beat out" for "parry-riposte".
Despite these difficulties, I.C. has fenced reason-
ably successfully this term. Our first match against
Salle Paul, with two-thirds an Olympic team, was lost
15-5. The next two matches, versus King's and Poly were
also lost, both by 16-11; mainly due to the poor standard
of the epee fencing. In the latest match, against tJ.C,
we lost the f o i l and epee both 4-5, but by dint of some
hard sabre play won that weapon 7-2, and so won the match
15-12.
