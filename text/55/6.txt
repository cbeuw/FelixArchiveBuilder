FELIX
MORPHY-DAY
Morphy Day, under pleasant conditions of a s l i g h t
following wind, and cajm water, saw Guilds retain the
Korphy Cup and the R.C.S. gain t h e i r f i r s t success i n
the Lowry Cup since 1948. The racing was good and
keen and the standard of oarsmanship augers w e l l f o r
some r e a l l y good I.C. rawing i n the coming year.
The marshalling and start of the Morphy Cup was an
object lesson i n the starter's art and a l l three crews
got away w e l l , C. AKG. i n centre station s t r i k i n g 54 i n
the f i r s t minute to the R.C.S. on Middx. 55 with R.S.M.
on Surrey a point or two lower. C. & C. took a s l i g h t
lead at once with R.S.M. taking advantage of t h e i r posi-
t i o n i n the faster water to lead R.C.S. At Harrods, C. & G.
( s t r i k i n g 30) were \ length ahead of R.S.M. ( s t r i k i n g 28)
with R.C.S. (at 31) z length behind. At t h i s point R.C.S.
began to p u l l up, and at the Crabtree C. & G. l e d by £
length from R.C.S. with R.S.M. a £ length behind. C. & G.
as b e f i t t e d t h e i r experience w e l l coupled up throughout
the stroke, but looking somewhat ponderous about t h e i r
blade entry were i n d i s t i n c t contrast to R.C.S. whose
" l i f e " on the beginning enabled them to maintain a higher
rate of s t r i k i n g and race hard and t h i s covered up d e f i -
ciencies i n time and timing. R.S.M. with two novice
oarsmen i n the boat very wisely allowed themselves to row
at t h e i r optimum rating and so get the best out of each
man. By the mile C. & G. were clear of the other two
crews but along the w a l l R.C.S. began to go up and were
overlapping the leaders by the Boathouses. Prom here t o
the f i n i s h C. & G. r e p l i e d to the challenge and won a very
good race by l£ lengths from R.C.S., with R.S.M. a further
l j lengths away, i a the good time of 7 mins. 44 sees.
The Lowry Cup proved to be a win f o r a hard working
R.C.S. crew who had plenty of l i f e on the beginning and
kept t h e i r blades w e l l covered throughout the stroke.
S t r i k i n g 9, 17, 25 and 33 i n the f i r s t quarter, half, three-
quarter and f u l l minute they were clear of the other two
crews at the end of the f i r s t minute and went on to win by
2g- lengths from C. & G. with R.S.M. a further 4 lengths
away i n 4 mins. 22 sees. A very good time under the con-
ditions.
Malcolm Campbell the R.C.S. non-rowing Captain i s t o
be congratulated on producing and coaching two good boats,
and the two newcomers to the r i v e r i n the R.S.M. boat deserve
high praise f o r racing so well s i x weeks a f t e r the start
of t h e i r rowing careers.
The starter was C.A. Bristow and the umpire R.C. Morris.

Those of I.C. who peer into the gym on Monday or
Thursday evenings are usually either shocked or enthralled
by the display of energy and s k i l l which is sometimes
being demonstrated. The complexity of fencing i s
bewildering to the novice, and even more so to the
President who interprets "beat out" for "parry-riposte".
Despite these difficulties, I.C. has fenced reason-
ably successfully this term. Our first match against
Salle Paul, with two-thirds an Olympic team, was lost
15-5. The next two matches, versus King's and Poly were
also lost, both by 16-11; mainly due to the poor standard
of the epee fencing. In the latest match, against tJ.C,
we lost the f o i l and epee both 4-5, but by dint of some
hard sabre play won that weapon 7-2, and so won the match
15-12.

On Friday Nov. 15th I.C.A.F.C. played against
Aachen University at Motspur Park, The weather was
t y p i c a l of a foreigner's conception of the English
climate, cold and damp, with the now inevitable traces
of smog. However, these phenomena i n no way affected
the German' play and they won by four goals t o one.
Play began at an extremely fast pace and but for
some atrocious marksmanship the I.C. team would have
had a comfortable lead a f t e r the f i r s t f i f t e e n minutes.
After t h i s period Aachen settled down and began to play
soccer peculiar to the Continent, keeping the b a l l cm
the ground and moving i t quickly from man to man without
attempting to dribble. On occasions these tactics
s p l i t the I.C. defence wide open and Aachen b u i l t up a
two goal lead by half-time. The f i r s t h a l f had
produced some f i r s t - c l a s s f o o t b a l l with the German team
gradually gaining the ascendancy.
In the second h a l f the I .C. team attacked vigor-
ously but could make no impression on a defence which
cleared i t s l i n e s in the most acrobatic fashions. It
appeared that the German centre half had modelled his
style of play on that of Parola, the I t a l i a n player
famous for h i s overhead kicks. I.C. d i d manage to get
a c o n s o l a t i o n g o a l but i f there had been a forward
capable of scoring goals i t might have been a different
story.
A Dinner was given i n the Union a f t e r the match,
where i t was learned that Aachen were the present
European U n i v e r s i t i e s Champions and that most of their
players were semiprofessionals with German clubs. On
t h e i r tour they had beaten Birmingham University 2-1
and drawn with Loughborough 2

The Germans presented the I.C. club with a pennant,
which now adorns one of the trophy cases, as a remember-
ance of t h e i r v i s i t and as a token of t h e i r appreciation
for the enjoyable time they had at I.C.
