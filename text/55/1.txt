*eaxs that Mcrphy Day was going to become l i t t l e more
thaa the current hooliganism of student rags were dispelled
by a touch of o r i g i n a l i t y from Guilds. 'Bo' arrived at Putney
carrying unknown objects beneath a blue shroud. On a r r i v a l of
about 200 l o y a l Guilcismen the shroud was removed to reveal
•two c o f f i n s , one bearing the i n s c r i p t i o n R.C.S. and the
iother R.S.M. These were carried on the shoulders of none-too
-soberly dressed Guildsmen who lead the procession to the I.C.
boathouse. A debate with the gentlemen i n blue as t o whether
the procession should proceed or not resulted i n a decision
t o go forward - and carried by an overwhelming majority.
Meanwhile, E.C.S. had gathered at the boathouse. Their
a r r i v a l i n twos and threes seemed t o indicate that they did nc
[
not take advantage of the very greatly reduced rates that can
be obtained from London Transport f o r very large party t r a v e l .
B.C.S. welcomed the Guilds procession w i t h a shower of flour
bag® and explosives but by sheer weight of numbers, Guilds
took "The Corner". Here the c o f f i n s were placed f o r safe
keeping and remained there despite several attacks by both
Mines and B.C.S. The lack of success was due to lack of
numbers with the Miners (who, after a l l , should be congratulate^
on having some supporters even after mustering two crews) and
f o r want of the presidents lead f o r theE.C.S.
After some a c t i v i t i e s of a secondary nature on the r i v e r
Guilds, with due ceremony and Boomalackas, consigned the ,
c o f f i n s to the r i v e r - and without being molested. Things
livened up as 'Bo' t r i e d to depart. One despicable character
v i o l a t e d t r a d i t i o n by attempting to throw something i n 'Bo
He was m&de'to r e a l i s e h i s mistake by an involuntary
association with the r i v e r .
On the departure of 'Bo' some made t h e i r way bask to
I.C. but i t was too late i n the day f o r a 'party'. A few
G u i l d smen did'try to demonstrate a method of bringing-down
the c e i l i n g i n R.C.S. but were discouraged by a demonstration
of firehoses - with hot and cold running water.
iThe Say was rounded o f f by a "free" hop i n the
iGjn, which was w e l l f i l l e d , but not overcrowded, probably •
"because i t was on-published. So while the Boat Club
were enjoying themselves i n style, t h e i r supporters I
ware doing so on a s l i g h t l y lower l e v e l ; altogether an
excellent Morphy Day.

V REMOVALS
i Jbottt 4.00 on Thursday afternoon, the yellow three-
wheeler standing outside Guilds became the yellow three-
wheeler standing inside Guilds - on the landing between
the ground and the first floors. Due to lack of. co-
ordination betwaen the architect responsible for Guilds
and the designer of 3 wheel cars, the main entrance into
Guilds was insufficient to allow the passage of the
driving mirror. A large notice advertised that this
marvellous specimen of automobile engineering was for
sale - much to the surprise of i t s owner. It is
rumoured that his audible expression of astonishment
prompted the prominent member of the Guilds staff
accompanying him, to suggest that in future he should
park his means of transport elsewhere. This advice
was evidently taken to heart and by 5.00 the yellow
three-wheeler was again standing outside. Outside the
post-office; not Guilds.'
ALBERT
I r i n c e Albert of the memorial has come in f o r a l o t
of attention t h i s week. We seem to have developed a
f i x e d idea that he i s not properly dressed f o r various
occasions.
On Tuesday, the Rag Comaittee went and ensured that
he w i l l f e e l no i l l effects of the smog that was threa-
tening by putting a large—sized smog-mask on him. This
promptly disappeared with the fog.
Another group has been measuring him f o r a space-
suit i n the past week. I t i s reported that t h i s i s con-
nected with the rocket craze that seems to be sweeping
1.0. at present.
