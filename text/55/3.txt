HOPALONG FELIX IS FOUR
I t i s a hard t h i n g t o have a r e p u t a t i o n to maintain.
The FELIX Birthday Dance over the l a s t two years has
b u i l t up one of such a high order t h a t , when faced with
o r g a n i s i n g i t again t h i s year, we f e l t q u i t e nervous.
Another t r o u b l e w i t h memorable occasions i s tb* f a c t that
nobody remembers what went on l a s t year. A f t e r c o n s i d e r * !
s t r a i n on b r a i n s and memories the FELIX Board has at l a s t
got something which we t h i n k w i l l be q u i t e as aaBeing and
i n t e r e s t i n g an a f f a i r as l a s t year's. (We can't count on
the f o g coming down again, of course, but we're hoping.)
Hot® tha data - December 5th, and keep your eyes open f o r
the s a l e o i t i c k e t s , as they are l i a b l e to disappear beforej
you can say ' F e l i x Dance' backwards. One i n d i s c r e e t h i n t

something TO THEIR ADVANTAGE.

You have to look p r e t t y c l o s e l y before you r e a l i s e
that there's a pun i n that word. Perhaps I should
e x p l a i n that i t ' s going to be the name of the new univer-
s i t y newspaper. Can you see i t now? Well, never mind
At long l a s t the U.L.U. has regained enough courage
to launch yet another weekly newspaper. Two dismal
f a i l u r e s take a l o n ^ time before they are f o r g o t t e n . The
point i s , t h i s time i t i s a l l DIFFERENT. I t i s a more
ambitious undertaking than the l a s t two were, and l i k e a
l a r g e t a c k l e i n Rugby, hopes to achieve success by b u l l -
dozing. Well begun i s h a l f won, and they are going to go
a l l out r i g h t from the beginning. Very w e l l , you say,
what about i t ? There, as Hamlet s a i d , i s the rub.
It r e q u i r e s considerable o r g a n i s a t i o n . I t needs
people i n a l l Colleges and people from a l l Colleges. I.C.
being one of the B i g Four i s expected to .come forward with
help i n a l l f i e l d s . I f you l i k e to help from here, help
to s e l l i t , or w r i t e about I.C. a c t i v i t i e s i n i t , or send
sports r e s u l t s on to them. Or i f you want to help 'over
there' (U.L.D., that i s ) , they need sub-editors, a r t i s t s ,
photographers, and just h e l p i n g hands. I t shouldn't take
much of your time i f you are good at p a r c e l i n g i t and even
i f you are n o t , you can leave when you want t o .
"The Sennet" w i l l s t a r t p u b l i s h i n g next term - January

TWO NEW SOCIAL CLUBS
C o n t r i b u t i o n time f o r a l l p r o s p e c t i v e w r i t e r s :
by whioh I mean prose, poetry, cartoons, q u i p s ,
and what have you.
The combined C h r i s t m a s - B i r t h d a y i s s u e of FELIX
oomes out on Deo.11, and l i g h t h e a r t e d c o n t r i b u t i o n s
are i n v i t e d . I f we get enough m a t e r i a l , we propose
to p u b l i s h an 8-page FELIX at the same p r i c e .
PHOENIX, s p r i n g term, needs c o n t r i b u t i o n s
t o o . These should be handed i n by Dec. 4th at
the l a t e s t .
Good news for those that like more social activities. "
There is a new Social Club that has come into being last
fortnight and another one will probably be formed in the
next few days. The Social Clubs require a minimum of
20 members for each new club and bothhave fulfilled this
condition.
The Billiards Club was in embryonic form at the end
of last session and has now been fully organised. It
has an »"""»' subscription or 5/-, and will operate
throughout the year in the Staff Common Room, Beit Build-
ing. Ladders for billiards and snooker will be hung up
there, to be operated i n the normal fashion.
Olnb Officers:
Captain: Dr. R. T. Severn
Hon. Sec: V. Barnes (Room 97, I.C. Hostel)
Committee Members: Dr. L. T. Owen

UNESCO sponsor a chain of Clubs called International
Relations Clubs, are for the very general purpose of
developing and increasing mutual understanding amongst
different peoples; in most cases, they also help pros-
pective travellers by way of first-hand information on
various countries. This aspect should especially appeal
to members of I.C. who go a l l over the world in pursuit
of pleasure and profession. The list on the general
Internal notice-board already exceeds 20, but many more,
especially from this country, would want to join the Club
and make i t a success. This Club would probably be
started from Dec. 2, when the Social Clubs Cccmittee meets.
