the College Secretary, to the
detriment of almost everyone in
College: the Union lost money and
space, and the staff lost the only place
in College where they could get away
from all the students for an hour. On
the last Tuesday of the Autumn term
the Rector, and John Smith, called a
meeting which was packed out with
hostile academics, where M r Smith
gave a long presentation showing how
the refectory system had developed
and how it stood today; facts which
could be found out by the simple
process of having lunch. (Is this the
first F E L I X news round-up that
doesn't mention Victor Mooney?)
The audience was so hostile that at
one stage it looked as though M r
Smith himself might end up on the
menu of an impromptu staff
barbeque.
A n emergency U G M voted by an
easy majority to boycott the QT snack
bar, until College started to admit that
the Union was being diddled out of
cash and space. Surprisingly the
boycott worked, despite the
carnivourous cravings of many
students who were forced to forgo
their daily dose of animal flesh by
eating 'tofu' (which is made from old
copies of the Guardian, incidentally)
etc, at the ideologically sound Union
Snack Bar instead of revelling in the
taste of animal flesh at QT. Only a
few people crossed the picket lines,
and the snack bar was shut in two
days. Negotiations started in earnest,
and the boycott was called off: a
complete success. Meanwhile, the
Rector started to investigate plans for
setting up a field station in Siberia
(Deputy Head of Cleaning Services:
M r J Smith).
The University of London Union
was also having its problems. They
were threatened with a massive cut in
funding by the U G C , which would
basically force it to shut, despite the
fact that it provides a very useful
facility for somewhere in the region
of 40,000 students. They too started
a campaign, but as there was no food
involved the response from IC was
less impressive. A few crackpots held
a 'pram race', although the 'prams'
turned out to come from those well-
known Mothercare rivals, Waitrose,
Sainsburys and Safeways. Whether
the IC contribution helped the
campaign or not we shall never know,
but thankfully the U G C relented and
the cuts never took place.
The year's successes include Rag,
with Tiddleywinks raising over £3000
and Monopoly raising £2400, and for
this the Rag Chairman, Man Tai,
must receive some congratulation.
The Phoenix, the I C literary
magazine, managed to reach its
centenary, despite the many
prophecies of its demise, and there
was a week of events to celebrate this.
The Boat club also had success. With
Boat Club around, IC Union will
never be taken over by red activists,
because within two months it will
bleed the Union white again.
Failures include the morons who
poured scorn on the concept of lesbian
and gay rights, and the Labour Party.
It is the end of term. In a few days
the undergraduates will start leaving
College. The staff and PGs can get
back to doing some work, while the
undergraduates move away: some
leaving for three months, some for a
lifetime. The dream is over, and
reality beckons. Some things will be
the same next year and every year.
Next year's grant will be 3.75%
higher, so once again it will be
inadequate. There will be no General
Election, but if there were the
Conservatives would win it. And next
year, as is the case every year,
College accomodation will be in
crisis.
