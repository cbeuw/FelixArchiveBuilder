THE
CATCH IN
THE RYE-
BREAD
In a century which has seen the fall
of Slater-Walker, insider trading
carried o n routinely, and the
laundering of millions of pounds from
the B r i n k s - M a t robbery, one
remarkable con trick has made all of
these pale into insignificance. A fraud
so audiacious that it could only have
been carried out with the billions of
dollars available to the largest of the
multinationals.
The number of people to have been
taken in must now run into the
billions. Whole nations have been
possessed by the promises of these
tricksters, and convinced to part with
vast sums of their money.
There can only be one thing that be
described this way; it is not the
adultering of petrol with peanut oil,
nor the imagined harvest of jojoba
nuts in Paraguay but that"passport to
a better life", the health food boom.
Even the most elaborate con tricks
of the past have never involved the
complicity of so many of the medical
and nutritional fraternity. Each had to
be expensively bought off and
extensively briefed by a team
dedicated to carrying off their fraud
and the money that came with it.
It was in 1973, with the beginnings
of the oil crisis that the thoughts of
two o f the largest fast food
manufacturers turned to increased
profits. In America the huge consortia
of Global Foods Inc and International
Catering, responsible for 90% of the
Western fast food network, became
increasingly concerned with the
saturation of the hamburger market.
They were making new inroads into
Europe as they set about replacing
fish and chip shops and cafes, but it
was readily apparent that once those
markets were taken up, no amount of
cheap Coke would help them.
With this in mind they recruited
Steve Chlebowski, leading business
consultant and pioneer of computer
fraud. Born Steven Martin Bowie, he
changed his surname to Chlebowski
on the advice of his manager when he
was harbouring ambitions o f
becoming a rock guitarist. However
he soon found that his destiny was as
one of the kingpins of the American
Business System—a covert action
consultant.
George Sand, who has spent much
of the last decade researching into
Chlebowski's career, takes up the
story:
"Chlebowski was a master; while
the companies could only think of
expanding fast food into the
Communist bloc, he came up with the
idea of a competing principle—the
companies would set about marketing
health foods. He would harness the
forces of the hippy era, pretend to
turn them against the giants, and in
turn make them vast profits from the
sale of aduki beans and lentils.
"It was simple, while the hippies
and natural food freaks suffered from
diarrhoea and digestive problems,
vast amounts of money would be
spent convincing doctors and
scientists thatjunk food would kill and
health foods would save them.
" O K , youm might think that if you
got chronic diarrhoea and all you
were eating was vegetables, you'd put
two and two together and figure that
this health food stuff wasn't so
w o n d e r f u l . Then words like
" c h o l e s t e r o l " and " h a r d e n e d
arteries" came along as if by magic,
or in Chlebowski's case, as i f by
bribery. Suddenly meat, not to
mention hamburgers and deep fried
chicken, was a passport to the
mortuary. A l l they had to do was
convince the public at large that eating
junk was naughty and that bran
enriched lentils were where it was at.
"It was making junk food taboo
that proved to be Chlebowski's
masterstroke. It's like sex, once you
tell people that they shouldn't do it,
and should beat themselves with birch
twigs instead, you get a couple of
mugs who get into self-flagellation,
but the rest think that it must be
something really good and will do
anything to get it. Likewise, when
everyone started to hear that junk was
going to kill you, they figured that it
must be like snorting coke, and they
all went out and got into burgers.
"What the companies had to do
was to make sure that they controlled
the supplies of all the health foods as
well. It actually turned out to be quite
a simple operation. In the early days
the only people who actually grew
things like aduki beans, lentils and
soya beans were those hippies that
hadn't become accountants and
stockbrokers. Buying them out
"They figured that it
must be like snorting
coke, and they all went
out and got into
burgers."
proved to be no problem, all
Chlebowski had to do was tell them
how the C I A had planned to
assassinate the Grateful Dead and they
gave them the lot. O f course they got
the hippies to farm the plantations.
They also got a couple of lucrative
dope farms while they were at it,
which brought in a few extra
dollars."
It was after this that Chlebowski
was deemed to be too dangerous to
the companies, and had to be taken
out. However, he guessed that the
atmosphere was turning against him
and he disappeared. George found
him again two years ago:
" Y e a h , he was making a living
from selling ground up O X O cubes
to high school kids at ten dollars an
ounce. But he got found out when one
of the teachers took a drag. He was
talking about going into politics. I
think he's running a chain of singles
laundrettes for American troops in
Lebanon, n o w . "
It was towards the end of the
seventies that they discovered an
increasing trend among health freaks
to eat a diet of all-bran and soya
beans, and then every month they
would binge on quarterpounders, fries
and hot apple pies. Not only were the
companies making vast profits from
junk, and selling carraway seeds at
vastly inflated prices, but people were
now swallowing both.
"They would eat only health foods
for ages and then once they thought
that they were healthy enough they
would pig out on junk food," claimed
food-market analyst John Stuckley.
He has been studying the health food
boom since he discovered the strange
correlation between the expansion of
fast food chains and the growth of the
health food industry. Thinking that
there seemed to be no obvious way
that the two could go hand-in-hand he
decided to investigate further.
He found that nutritionists all over
the world had either been selectively
hoodwinked or bribed by middlemen
acting for the companies:
" A whole new corporation was
formed to deal with the problem of
'convincing' that many people that
health foods were not a giant con
trick. However, if the fag companies
can manage to get their tar tables
widely accepted I suppose health
foods can't be too difficult. I mean
there is a certain grain of truth in the
health foods idea, the sort of natural,
no additives thing is quite attractive.
"In fact the whole story has been
made so plausible that it is probably
Gifficult to stop now. How do you set
about discrediting that many medical
minds? If people start to scream
conspiracy now they're liable to end
up in a padded cell, all financed by
giant food multinationals.
"Rumour has it that the new boss
of Global Foods has recently gone
over to a soya/bran only diet—he
won't touch junk. The files from the
seventies seem to have disappeared
somewhere, and the old bosses aren't
saying anything. It has reached such
proportions that junk joints are
offering burgers in brown bread with
free nutritional information. It's all
gone m a d . "
George Sand had one final thing to
say when we last contacted him:
"Apparently all the old directors of
Global Foods and International
Catering have left or retired. I rang
one of them up, Geoff Schmidt, and
he just muttered something about
overseas singles laundrettes being the
thing to get into. Food seems to be
going out of fashion."
