Featura FELIX, W e d n e s d a y J u n e 24th 1 9 8 7 33
These photographs were taken while in the
Soviet Union and in Poland last summer. The
cities visited — M o s c o w , Leningrad and
W a r s a w — and the concentration camps
were fascinating places w h i c h could not be
summarised in a thousand pictures or a
million words. One can only hope to impart
a flavour of the trip and to give the historical
background of the images.
1. These portraits were taken of w o m e n
prisoners in Auschwitz, near K r a k o w , at the
beginning of the war. Each photograph is
captioned by the name, occupation, date of
entrance to the camp and date of death.
Those w h o looked most defiant in the
pictures tended to have the shortest camp
lifespans. Later in the war, the Nazis were
unable to keep such records as too m a n y
people were being killed too quickly.
2. In 1917 Lenin returned from exile to lead
the revolution in Russia. H e arrived at
Finland Station in the capital, St Petersburg
(Petrograd, n o w Leningrad), where he made
his famous 'Peace, Land, Bread' speech The
statue w h i c h n o w stands in front o* v
.e
station commemorates this event.
3. These murals are typical of those w h i c h
can be found in many places in M o s c o w and
Leningrad. Painted in striking colours they
promote the slogan of the day while
brightening dreary walls.
4. T h e E x h i b i t i o n of E c o n o m i c
Achievement in Moscow has many buildings
devoted to different areas of industry,
technology and agriculture. This picture
shows the exhibition on A t o m i c energy with
a model of a Light Water Cooled, Graphite
Moderated Reactor to the left. T w o months
after 'Chernobyl', however, there was little
reference to the disaster.
5.This poster was an exhibit at the Museum
of the October Revolution in M o s c o w w h i c h
covers political and economic events from
the revolution in 1917 to the present day.
Printed during the war, the poster is a
reminder that the 'Western' and 'Eastern'
blocks have not always existed — we were
all on the same side once.
6. While we were in W a r s a w , Comrade
Gorbachev was also there for the Party
Congress. The 'People's Palace' in w h i c h it
took place had been given to W a r s a w by
Stalin w h o had had seven similar buildings
constructed in Moscow.
7. This is a photograph of a hut at Birkenau,
a Nazi concentration camp just along the
road from Auschwitz. W h e n the Nazis
realised that defeat was inevitable, they
murdered as m a n y Jews and Poles as they
could and then burnt Birkenau to the ground
to destroy the evidence. Of the scores of huts
w h i c h had existed, only the brick chimneys
now remain. This hut was reconstructed after
the war.
8. W a r s a w was completely destroyed
during the war but was subsequently rebuilt
so that one can still walk through the 'old'
parts of town. There were m a n y open fruit
and vegetable stands in Warsaw, like the one
on the left, w h i c h sold goods w h i c h were
probably slightly radioactive. There were no
such stalls in M o s c o w or Leningrad. T h e
strawberries were delicious.
