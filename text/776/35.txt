Wine
A wine bar whine
Kensington has more than its fair
share of wine bars—though the
quality of many of them leaves a lot
to be desired.
They tend to be dark, dingy pub
conversions that retain the distinctive
smell of stale beer.
You pay £2 for a small glass of
warm German piss that gives you a
headache. The Ploughman's lunch is
usually a mouse-trap sized piece of
mild cheddar with a wilted lettuce leaf
and a large dollop of Branston pickle.
(Perhaps it is just me, but the pickle
always seems to end up on the handle
of the plastic knife.)
By contrast, the Church Street
Wine B a r , which opened last week,
is light and airy and serves fine wines
and good food. The decor is simple
but stylish: plain walls and tubular
steel.
The wine list is much better than
usual for wine bars. There are ten
different champagnes, ranging from
Krug Grand Cuvee at £35 a bottle to
the house champagne at £2.85 a glass.
The list of around 70 wines covers
France, Spain, Portugal, Italy,

Ice cream
Civ Eng
A n icecream freak's paradise, and a
mere mortal's journey into the
unknown, can be found at the
Underground Food Factory, at 13
Wardour Street. For £1.35 you are
allowed to make your own icecream,
using strawberry and vanilla flavours,
and a vast multitude of sauces and
toppings. There is no limit to the
amount that you put into the sundae
dish, so provided you use the wafers
dexterously, you can build the
icecream equivalent of the Empire
State Building. The only problem is
eating it—a bib is recommended!
They also do pizzas, ribs, etc, and
as a final incentive, they give all
ladies a balloon to take home! If you
are in a rush, or can't make it to
Leicester Square before the cravings
start, there is always Grangelatto's in
Montepelier Street, near Harrods.
They make the best homemade
icecream in London, you can go
through orgies of self-indulgence
sampling the thirty or so flavours!
By the way, a sure way to
overcome the cravings is to read the
dictionary definition of
icecream—yuk!

Vivacious managing director Janie
Greenall hadn't wanted to include
Germany but she was persuaded to
include a Niersteiner Gutes Domtal.
At £5.95 a bottle, I guess not many
people will be foolish enough to buy
it.
Better value for summer drinking
is the Pinot Blanc from Alsace, from
the excellent house of Gisselbrecht,
at £1.65 a glass. Alternatively, try a
Muscadet de Sevre et Maine sur lie
(two steps up from ordinary
Muscadet) at £1.60 a glass.
The house claret is probably worth
a mis- '' is made by Borie Manoux
—who also makes the notorious
Imperial College Common Room
Cuvee. It's probably the same wine
with a different label. If you must
drink it then buy it from the College
cellar for roughly half the price.
At the wine bar, try the House Red,
Cuvee Jacques Mathiot at £1.25 a
glass, or the Teobaldi I 1983 from
Spain at £1.35.
If you really want to splash out you
In the world of rock 'n' roll there are
a million musicians in the 'could have
been stars club'. A l l they needed was
the 'big break' the chance to play
alongside Ian Gillan, say, or take over
from Randy Rhodes with Ozzy
Osborne; just like Bernie Torme.
However, neither of these were to
work out for Bernie, and it was back
to his long standing personal projects.
The past couple of years have seen the
rise of Torme, the band; there was
even keen record company interest,
which sadly came to nothing. The
biggest blow came a few months ago
when ex-Girl vocalist, Phil Lewis,
deserted to America and the LA Guns.
The new band has emerged under
the guise of the Gypsy Cowboys. The
line up features Chris Heilman (bass),
Steve Dior (vocals) and A Random
(drums), but I have been told Steve
is only temporarily up front.
A l l of the old faces were in the
crowd, ready for the return of their
hero, who arrived casually onto the
Marquee stage and not surprisingly
used Wild West as an opener. In fact
the show was to see only three songs
from the Torme era, the most notable
of these being Star, a perfect mixture
of hard rock guitar riffs and pop
melody.
can often get best value for your
money from the New World. Among
the whites, the Austalian Hunter
Valley Semillon Chardonnay from
Penfolds is £8.15 a bottle and well
worth a try. Also from Aus is the red
Koonunga Hill 1985 at £8.95.
The food at the launch party last
week was excellent, as you'd expect.
It remains to be seen how the quality
keeps up. The sample menus look
exciting, though. Apple and stilton
soup; sauteed duck's livers, chicken
and artichoke pie; fresh pasta with
basil, bacon and cream; blackcurrant
and mint pie.
A long way from the Ploughman's
lunch. But, of course, it's a bit more
pricey, too. You don't have to have
a three-course meal, so if you just
want a starter and a glass of wine,
allow a minimum of £5 a head.
For a three course meal with wine,
allow at least £15.
There are few more pleasant ways
of sliding inexorably further into debt
than in the consumption of fine wines
and good food in pleasant
surroundings.
Bernie's work tonight seemed more
relaxed and flowing than of late. He
threw solos and riffs at the audience
in a manner which showed he was in
control and was not holding anything
back to soothe a Phil Lewis ego,
indeed the vocalist Steve Dior didn't
seem to have a personality, never
mind an ego!
M r Dior was the one disap-
pointment of the show. He was totally
lost in the sound mix and what was
audible was little more than average.
Add to this his lack of stage presence
and it all comes to a dead end
career-wise.
The rhythm section of the band
could not be faulted, in fact the
drummer was a good deal better than
Bernie's o l d drummer, Ian
Whitewood. As ever, Chris Heilman
provided a good solid and relevant
bass line.
In its present form, ie with that
vocalist, the band is not as strong as
they were with Phil Lewis. However,
the band is more comfortable without
him and, given a vocalist with
personality but no ego, this could well
be the line up that gives Bernie his
chan'ce, perhaps his last chance.

The silent
twins
In the spring of 1982, two girls were
sentenced to an indefinite period of
detention at Broadmoor. Their names
were Jennifer and June Gibbons,
nineteen-year-old twins. T h e
incredible story of their lives and the
events leading up to their trial and
incarceration is told in a new book by
award winning campaign journalist of
the Times and Sunday Times,
Marjone Wallace.
The story is one of the ultimate
love- hate relationship between
identical twins, the struggle for
individuality and recognition in an
uncaring world, and their final cry for
help and downfall.
The twins were born daughters of
a Service family in Aden, and their
early lives were characterised by the
endless moving associated with
Forces life. However, it soon became
clear that they were not destined to
be normal happy children. They were
slow to start speaking, and as soon as
their schooling began, their speech
development ground to a halt. They
became shy, introverted, speaking
only to one another, in private, while
presenting a wall of silence to the
outside world. Incredibly, this went
unchecked, and by the time they
reached teenage life, they were
apparently totally uneducated. In
private they had lived on a diet of pulp
fiction and television, developing a
love of writing tainted by all that is
worst in the distorted view of life
presented by romantic novels and
American television. Locked away in
their room at home they took
correspondence courses in writing,
spent what little money they had on
attempting to get their work
published, and wrote endless diaries.
Tragically, they developed a deadly
love-hate relationship, competing to1
be best in whatever they did. This
ballooned in their liaisons with U S
Air Force servicemen at the base
where they lived. Jealousy between
the two led to fights and even attempts
on one another's lives. Realising that
they were paradoxically inseparable,
but unable to exist together, the twins
set out on a course of destruction and
crime as a cry for help.
The tale is riveting, but the style of
writing can be annoying. In an
attempt to prevent the story being
recounted as a medical case history
it hops between excerpts from the
twins' diaries, interviews with
concerned parlies, and a presentation
of the story in novel form. Despite
these distractions, the book is
compulsive reading, and a fascinating
insight into the psychology of twins,
with an ultimately tragic ending.
