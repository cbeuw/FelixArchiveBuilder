'When did you last see your trousers ?'
is a brilliant farce. Currently playing
in the West End, it stars William
Gaunt, Susie Blake and Michael
Sharvell-Martin amongst others.
William Gaunt, who played Arthur
Crabtree in the magnificent B B C
television series No Place Like Home,
is cast as Howard, an unfaithful
husband whose mistress, Penny,
owns a flat in Knightsbridge.
The fun begins when Howard and
Penny (played by Susie Blake) wake
up together in Penny's flat to find that
they have been burgled and as well
as several items of jewellery, the
inconsiderate burglar has also stolen
Howard's trousers.
This leaves Howard with the
problem of how to get home and how
to explain to his wife why he is only
wearing his underwear.
The action really hots up when
Howard steals a pair of trousers from
Penny's neighbour (played by
Michael Sharvell-Martin) only to
throw them away again later after
eating a mince pie spiked with hash.
W i l l i a m Gaunt and Michael
Sharvell-Martin, who also appeared
in No Place Like Home as Arthur
Crabtree's neighbour, Trevor, make
an excellent team and make this farce
one of the best I have ever seen.
When did you last see your
trousers ? is currently showing at the
Garrick Theatre on Charing Cross
Road (100 yards South of Leicester
Square tube station) Monday to
Saturday at 8pm, with matinees at
3pm on Tuesday and 5pm on

your U L U card with you.
Overall, When did you last see your
trousers? provides an excellent
evening's entertainment. A good time
guaranteed for all.

A night on
the town
Everyone's idea of a good night on
the tiles varies a great deal. So I'm
sure it is taken for granted that it's up
to you to enjoy yourself, whatever the
cost—and London can be an
expensive place when having fun.
Club bar prices are usually over the
top (you can forget Union bar prices)
so get a few in at a pub beforehand—
but remember if you wait until
chucking-out time you could have
trouble on the door at a lot of places,
especially on Fridays and Saturdays,
and unless you want to queue (or
know the doormen) go early-ish
(before about 10.30) you won't get
many problems at this time of night
and you might even find it's slightly
cheaper before 11.00.
Some of the places listed below are
more music venues than night clubs
so check in Time Out or City Limits
to see who's playing.
100 Club, Oxford Street—Great
place to see a lively band (Boogie
Brothers, Rent Party anything
African). Audience can be quite wild
so go well prepared!
Fridge, Brixton—Converted
cinema is very big. Excellent party
nights, very ordinary crowd having
a good time, be prepared to get
searched on the way in watch out for
the T V walls.
Academy, Brixton—Another
converted cinema, pretty basic. Very
ordinary place to see a band.
Bass Clef, Hoxton—Small, hot,
incredibly lively and energy-
draining—you can't go wrong if you
like African or Latin music. Stick
around for the Reggae afterwards as
well.
Clarendon, Hammersmith—A
dump with no style, shoot upstairs
and stay all night.
Broadway Boulevard, Ealing—
It's worth hitting this very smart disco
where there's a good friendly
atmosphere and a surprising shortage
of posers. Smart lights and smart
crowd!
Dingwalls, Camden Lock—Sweat
it out to one of your favourite pub
bands.
Camden Palace, C a m d e n —
"Sixties night" is a very friendly
night at this old Boy George hang out,
be prepared to dance with anyone and
everyone.
Le Beat Route, Gerard Street—A
bit of a tourist trap, worth going to
see those groovy Italian posers.
Xenon, Picadilly—Lots to see and
do—I've seen fire eaters and jugglers
here—don't bother with the sick-
making cocktails though.
Palookaville, Covent Garden—
Nice relaxed jazz bar.
Wag Club, Wardour Street—The
crowd aren't as outrageous as they
used to be. Good jazz band on
Monday—swing those hipster jeans!
Zeeta's, Putney—A good party
atmosphere with the right kind of
people. 1
Empire, Leicester Square—Very
young crowd from the suburbs—don't
forget your puffball skirt!
The Park, Kensington—Smart
disco atmosphere. Choose the right
night and save a bit of cash, Tuesdays
I think if you can bear to mix with
more bloody students.
Shaftesbury's, Shaftesbury Ave—
Very ordinary disco. You can borrow
this place for a private party if you're
rich.
Heaven, Waterloo—Quite an eye-
opener even on "straight" nights.
Maximus, Leicester Square—
Don't like discos? Don't go here.
There are hundreds of clubs in
London and they change hands
regularly so you're bound to find
something that suits your style.
