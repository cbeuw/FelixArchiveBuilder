FELIX FELIX, W e d n e s d a y J u n e 24th 1 9 8 7 30
It has always been noticeable that
those who regularly pour scorn on
F E L I X have little idea of how much
work is involved in its production. A
brief analysis of how much time is put
into the paper may be an eye-opener
for one or two of our readers.
To deal first with the professionals:
the Print Unit has two permanent
members of staff, a typesetter
operator and a printer. Each of them
work 35 hours per week. The
sabbatical Editor nominally works a
35 hour week as well; the reality is
something more like 75 hours.
145 hours so far. Of the student
staff, there is a nucleus of about six
who regularly put in 20-25 hours each
week; 135 altogether, say. The
remainder of the regular staff (another
six people or so) probably notch up
about 10 hours per week; in addition
there are many more occasional
contributors and production
consultants (collators) who give up
2-3 hours each week; 30 hours total
is a reasonable average.
This makes a total of 370 hours.
Given that the F E L I X print run
averages slightly less than 4000, this
means that for every man hour that
goes into the production of F E L I X ,
ten copies are printed. If this seems
rather labour-intensive, then at least
try reading F E L I X for more than the
six minutes it took to produce your
copy before you throw it away!
The cost of each copy of F E L I X is
always a favourite topic of discussion.
There are usually 32 issues of
F E L I X each year; the average
circulation is slightly under 4,000.
Let's take 4,000 copies of 30
issues-a total of 120,000 F E L I C E S .
F E L I X receives a grant of £10,777
from the Union's central subvention.
In addition there are the salaries for
the two permanent members of staff
and the sabbatical Editor (slightly less
than £20,000), making a total cost of
around £30,000. Hence this familiar
calculation (£30,000+120,000) gives
you a cost per copy of 25p.
Expensive, perhaps. However, this
ignores the work that F E L I X does as
the Union Print Unit—producing
publicity material for many of the
Union clubs and societies. This year
we have brought in about £10,000 of
income for printing work within the
Union, at our cut-price rates. To have
this volume of work done at a
professional London printer would
probably cost about four times as
much. A saving of £30,000 meaning
each copy of F E L I X is effectively
free. If this seems like a rather
inflated claim, it might be interesting
to note, for example, that at a recent
printing show a "budget" print shop
quoted typesetting at £2.80 per foot.
The F E L I X charge is 40p per foot.
Enjoy the holiday!
