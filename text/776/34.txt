It was a hot, steamy morning—an evil
start in an evil city. I can't think of
any dialogue so there's 300 words of
boring description to think of. Never
mind, there's a body involved. The
clock struck twelve. Midnight is an
evil hour. The streets are littered with
broken bottles, broken promises and
broken houses. It's half past noon and
I've just got out of bed.
I separated the slats of the blind and
squeezed a look out. Batman and
Robin weaved thro' the lunchtime
traffic in. their Metro on the way to
City Hall. After the 6th cup of coffee
(is your house a Maxwell house?) the
little green men underneath the
wainscot had started to wake up. I hit
the office about one. blew the dust off;--
the empty filing cabinets and sorted
the mail. Wouldn't a lettei say it
better? The Mormons certainly
thought so, and there was one from
my ex-personal tutor, sayingplease
bring the books back. One of those
crazy days. I settled down and let the
chair get nicely adjustedto my spjjte.
