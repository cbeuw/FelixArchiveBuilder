The United Nations:
Two years ago on October 24th, the)
United Nations celebrated its fortieth
anniversary. Created after the Second
World War "to save : succeeding
generations from the scourge or
war...", it has since expanded its base
and now countenances 40 years of the
most turbulent change in history. The
challenge for the U N now seems to
be to justify to the developed world
the very need for its existence.
The general attitude towards the
U N among western student
populations is, I have found, one of
indifferent ignorance. Enquiries
generally produce vague descriptions
of "something to do with human
rights". Where people are slightly
more informed, the picture is of " a
group of overpaid individuals who
make up the greatest and most
powerless bureaucracy ever; an
organisation which squanders
governments' money on endless
conferences and adopts innumerable,
largely-ignored resolutions in political
matters over which it has no control''.
The disparity between the public
opinion of the United Nations and the
facts is alarming, and seems to be at
the root of recent criticism directed
at the organisation.
The Facts
The United Nations system is a non-
governmental organisation,
regrouping 159 member countries. It
consists of the United Nations
Organisation ( U N O ) and its
specialised programmes, and of 18
specialised agencies and autonomous
international organisations. The U N O
consists of the General Assembly, the
Secretariat, the Trusteeship Council
(concerned with decolonisation
matters), the International Court of
Justice, the Security Council and the
Economic and Social C o u n c i l ,
(ECOSOC). The latter controls the
U N O ' s 14 specialised programmes
and funds, such as U N I C E F (the
United Nations Childrens Fund)
U N D P (the United Nations
Development Fund) and U N H C R (the
High Commissioner for Refugees).
E C O S O C also deals with the
specialised agencies such as the
World Health Organisation (WHO)
the Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organisation ( U N E S C O ) ,
the F o o d and Agriculture
Organisation ( F A O ) and the
International Labour Office (ILO).
Less prominent agencies include the
International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA), the World Meteorological
Organisation ( W M O ) , the Universal
Postal Union (UPU) or the World
Intellectual Property Organisation
(WIPO).
As it appears from this brief sketch,
the United Nations is involved in
every possible aspect of society, and
the bulk of the U N has nothing to do
with politics. Over 80% of the
organisation's time and energy is
devoted to economic, social and
humanitarian issues, which tend to go
largely innoticed in our society
because they lack the media appeal of,
for example, Live A i d . The U N is
associated with political conflicts,
human rights, the global economic
situation or the eradication of
smallpox, yet there are few who
would link it with the preservation of

relics, the control of illegal drugs, the
allocation of radio frequencies or the
protection of patents on records; all
these come within the scope of U N
activities.
It seems the sheer size and scope
of the U N have engendered feelings
of distrust or hostility within the
Western public, feelings which are
nurtured by various cliches and
misconceptions concerning the
organisation.
"The United Nations is
an independent
arbitary body"
It is not. A s its name implies, the
United Nations is its member states;
159 governments which together
jtnake decisions on important issues,
each nation being expected to fulfill
the commitment it made to complying
with the U N charter.
"The UN is a
bureaucracy"
The United Nations Organisation uses
2,205 tons of paper every year (less
than The New York Times uses in a
single Sunday Edition). This amount
of paper may sound phenomenal, but
large organisations or governments
need to keep accurate records and
reports; in the U N many of these have
to be kept in the General Assembly's
six official languages; Arabic,
Chinese, English, French, Russian
and Spanish. Nevertheless, intense
efforts are being made to restrict the
size of documents.
"The UN places unfair
financial burdens on
governments, and the
money is inefficiently
spent"
In 1985 the United Nations and its
related agencies spent $5.4 billion. O f
this, $2.1 billion (39%) was spent on
relief activities, $1.8 billion (33%) on
health and $1.4 billion (26%) on
agriculture, forestry and fisheries.
The expenditure of the U N is often
branded as unjustified, an incredible
attitude given that, for the same
period, the world spent over $1000
billion on armament alone.
The U N O regular budget is of
$840billion pa and is paid by member
states. It constitutes one third of the
system's income, the other two thirds
coming from voluntary contributions
by governments, non-governmental
organisations and individuals.
Three countries, (the United States,
Japan and West Germany), contribute
29% of the U N budget. This may
sound unfair, but although these three
nations make the largest cash
contributions, a different picture
emerges when contribution as a
percentage of national income is
considered; the three top donors are
now Gambia (0.6%), Equatorial
Guinea (0.44%) and Comoros
(0.31%), with the States, Japan and
West Germany not even appearing in
the top 20s list. The principle is
simple; the richer nations have more,
and therefore give more.

Image vs Reality
Agricultural development: A major
step towards iradicating hunger
and malnutrition.
"The UN is dominated
by Third World
Nations which try to
use it against the
industrialised world"
In reality, developing countries are
inadequately represented in the
Secretariat, as they occupy 42% of
professional posts. The afore-
mentioned misconception seems to
stem from two main factors: Firstly,
the one country, one vote system in
the General Assembly actually allows
the position of developing countries
to be represented even if, due to many
of these countries being non-aligned,
the overall vote of the General
Assembly does not necessarily
support Western views on political
issues. (Note that a different voting
system operates in the Security
Council, with China, France, the
USSR, the U K and the U S A having
veto power). Secondly, poorer
countries have since 1974 been calling
for the establishment of a New
International Economic Order; this
would change present unfair patterns
of world trade, which consistently
benefit richer nations at the expense
of the poorer ones, and thus aid their
development efforts.
"UN staff members are
overpaid and
overpriviledged"
The United Nations system employs
50,000 people worldwide. The
professional category, excluding
delegates from member countries, are
international civil servants, and
consequently their salaries are
determined by the member
governments and the General
Assembly, the reference being the
United States C i v i l Service. A
deliberate policy of providing higher
salaries is used as an incentive to
attract high quality professionals,
especially as, more often than not,
working for the U N involves
expatriation.
As one would expect, all U N staff
pay taxes to their home countries
through the U N , and only delegate
and high-ranking professionals are
granted diplomatic immunity.
"The UN is virtually
powerless"
The role of the U N in international
relations has been the main target of
anti-UN criticism for years. The fact
that warfare, injustice and blatant
denial of human rights still persist in
the world is equated with the failure
of the United Nations to fulfill its
charter. This attitude is based on the
assumption that the U N is a world
goverment, endowed with sovereign
power to enforce actions, which it
certainly is not. Its member states
committed themselves to the charter
on joining the U N , and its respect is
their duty; whether they chose to
fulfill their duties is beyond U N
control. In this context the main role
of the U N is as a forum where
negotiations between countries—even
those engaged in warfare—can be
pursued and peaceful solutions to
conflicts found. On a multitude of
occasions, such as the Berlin crisis in
1948-49, the Cuban missile crisis in
1962, or the Middle-East crisis in
1973, the organisation has
successfully intervened in potentially
explosive conflicts; it seems the U N
will again have a role to play in the
resolution of the latest Gulf crisis
between the U S A and Iran.
It can never be overemphasised that
the United Nations is a human
organisation and is no less prone to
human error than any other
institution.
Despite this, the U N works, and its
work is invaluable. Where it seems
to have failed miserably is in
communicating its achievements to
the general Western public, which, as
a result, is mis-informed and
indifferent. Several reasons have been
put forward to explain this
information gap; firstly U N activities
in the developed world are not as
fundamental as in the Third World,
and hence are less visible; examples
being the standardisation o f
agricultural produce quality or the
cleaning up of the Mediterranean.
Furthermore, U N activities tend to
be long-term projects and hence lack
mass-media appeal.
The problems the world faces today
extend beyond national scope to
encompass humanity as a whole. It is
more vital now than ever that a
collective conscience is raised and
countries collaborate closely to
counteract the present frightening
trends in the world today. The United
Nations was created to fulfill this role
and it is equipped to do so, but above
all it needs the support of all its
people. In the words of former
Secretary, Genera! Kurt Waldheim:
"...the public image of the United
Nations and the way it is viewed in
the world at large is important, for
without popular understanding and
support it will be difficult, if not
impossible, for governments to make
the United Nations w o r k . "
