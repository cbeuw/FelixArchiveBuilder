If you feel lost without Fido or
Tibbies, why not get a plant? Plants
have many advantages over animals
as pets—they don't for example wake
you up in the middle of the night, rip
your wallpaper or need cleaning out.
If you get bored with your plant you
could even eat it (providing it is not
poisonous).
Having decided to keep a plant, the
first thing to do is to choose what it
is you wish to grow. If you want to
be able to eat it eventually, it is
usually best to choose an edible
variety. Since apple trees tend to take
up a lot of room, many people decide
to grow mustard and cress. This can
of course be grown in a wide range
of amusing places, like used
eggshells, lecture notes and other
people's carpets. More adventurous
plant lovers could try sewing a row
of lettuce along their windowsills or
attaching runner bean strings to their
wardrobes but permanent damage to
furniture should be avoided if at all
possible (even if it is in the name of
horticulture).
As many students have discovered,
there are many interesting plants
which one can grow without a large
initial capital outlay. One of the more
successful of these which I have tried
is the orange plant. For best results,
the pips should be soaked in water for
a week and put in the fridge for a
similar length of time. They should
then be transferred to a pot of soil,
kept in an airtight plastic bag in a
warm dark airing cupboard and left
until the shoots are about a centimetre
long. At this stage they can be put in
a light airy position.
Other 'plants for free' include
acorns, carrot-top ferns and potatoes.
It may be necessary to obtain soil and
a suitable container, but the cost of
this is usually within the budget of
most people. Another possibility is
the growing of 'cultures' of fungus or
mould, for example in old, unwashed
coffee cups. The method may be
learned from any 'genuine' student.
The eventual washing up of such cups
is thought to be the origin of the
phrase 'culture shock'.
Of course, a serious plantsperson
will be inclined towards more
extravagant undertakings. The choice
is very wide. A trip to any nursery
(and there is a very good one on the
Earl's Court Road) will reveal a
wealth of attractive pot plants and
seeds. There are annuals, perennials,
flowering plants, foliage plants and
so on, to choose from. Anything from
a poinsettia to a pansy will make an
excellent pet plant. If you are feeling
rich, spider orchids can be grown
with surprising ease in normal room
conditions. If you wish to grow such
unusual plants, however, I would
definitely recommend that you invest
in a good plant book, as it is important
to get the soil and other conditions
right.
Another interesting development in
plant-growing is to find unusual
containers. It is now somewhat old hat
to put a herb garden in an old
Victorian sink, but why stop at such
tame receptacles? Metal should be
treated with caution as it tends to rust,
and don't forget to ensure your plant
has adequate drainage (this is helped
by lining the bottom of the container
with broken plant pots, for instance).
Cardboard boxes have obvious
disadvantages, but anything plastic is
worth considering. There was once a
craze for melting old records and
bending them to form plant pots, but

don't play them any faster than 33 %
rpm once the plant is in the pot. One
suggestion I have is to line a drawer
or even a used grapefruit tango can
with a plastic bag. Alternatively, you
could try decorating a standard plant
pot with paint or anything else that
takes your fancy.
Once one has a plant well
established in a satisfactory container,
one should turn one's attention to
maintenance and long-term plant care.
The most important thing to
remember is to water the soil. Exact
watering requirements vary from
plant to plant, but as a general rule,
the plant will appreciate room-
temperature water whenever the soil
stops feeling moist. Many plants
require less water in the winter
months. The plant will also benefit
from being transferred to a larger
container (with enough soil to fill up
the gaps round the edge) when its
roots just show through the drainage
holes in the bottom of the container.
Whether to use fertiliser or insecticide
is a rather contentious issue:
personally I prefer the 'organic'
approach, which has the added
attraction that, in general, you simply
ignore such complications.
Occasionally I like to pour weak tea
over the soil instead of water,
especially in the case of ferns, but the
use of herbicide is to be discouraged.
Finally, to one of the most widely
debated aspects of plant growing, one
which causes emotional reactions in
many people. This is, of course,
whether one should talk to plants or
not. It seems that the plant will benefit
from this treatment, because when
you are talking to it you come close
enough to see whether it needs
watering or is being eaten by various
nasties for example. I definitely
advocate giving pot plants names as
-I feel it strengthens the emotional ties
and bonding between plant and
grower. The disadvantage is that one
tends to be rather more upset by the
plant's ill health or death. However,
rather than pontificate any more I will
leave you with a final thought from
one of the great philosophers of our
time: Whether or not you talk to your
plant, the important thing is to listen.
Alumnus
Day
A lot of people have passed through
this place—some 60,000 of them are
currently believed to be amongst the
quick. It is strange—but the College
knows of the whereabouts of fewer
than half our alumni—perhaps fewer
than a quarter. We would like to
know where they all reside...
The Alumnus Office has been
trying to remedy this state of affairs,
armed with a few PCs, a large hard
disk, willing hands and much
enthusiasm. It is up-hill work—but we
are getting there. We want to know
the Imperial College alumni—be they
the class of 1986 or 1926, their advice
to us can be invaluable. Besides which
they all gave three years of a critical
part of their lives to study here; many
have a natrual curiosity to see what
has happened to the place these 12
months, these sixty years.
Alumnus day is our first coherent
attempt at meeting Imperial College
alumni en masse. At this, our first
attempt, the mass may not be that
large—but will probably approach
1000 people. I believe that their
primary interest will be to visit their
own Departments—all of which will
be " o p e n " from 2pm to 7pm. there
will be tea on the Queen's Lawn, (it
never rains on 7 July) music from
string quartets, a talk by the Rector
in the Great Hall at 5.30, for all of
those who have done too much
standing, supper in the Beit Quad (it
never...), and much else.
Postgraduate students will be much
involved in demonstrating in their
own Departments and with the other
activities. A l l Imperial College
students who happen to be around are
welcome to participate—to visit
Departments—including some that
they may never before have
penetrated. I hope that you will be
kind to the visitors—remember that
one day you will (I hope) be one of
them...
