News FELIX, Wednesday June 24th 1987 5
Council Yawn
This year's Joint Union Council
Meeting, held on Monday, lasted for
414 hours. Amongst the business was
the award of Union pots and
Honorary Life Memberships for
contributions to the running of the
Union. In addition several elections
were held for non-officer posts in the
Union for next session.
Possibly the most important
discussion was about the Student
Residence Committee (SRC). Ian
Howgate presented a graphic and
rather worrying account of some of
the recent SRC meetings. College
Assistant Secretary Michael Arthur,
he reported, has overruled several
SRC decisions, and has been known
to alter minutes to suit his purposes.
As a result of this it was felt that SRC
had become totally ineffective. It was
therefore decided that Union reps on
this committee should observe at the
meetings but refuse to use their votes
in protest at Michael Arthur's and
College's conduct.
Also discussed at the meeting was
the use of the gravel money from
Harlington. Several members thought
that the money could be used better
if invested so as to use the interest
(which could be quite substantial).
However, it is uncertain how much
money will be available due to
fluctuating gravel prices. The money
will be held in trust by College, who
are unlikely to release it in the near
future. It was suggested that they
might even use it in the short term to
boost their own cash flow.
At the meeting it was also decided
to combine the posts of UGM and
Council Chairpersons, and to make
this new officer responsible for Union
policy. Although this new post will
come into being at the end of next
year, incoming U G M Chairman
'Ala;*">ir Seymour was also elected
Council Chairman and agreed to lay
the groundwork before the two posts
officially become one.
Amongst the Honorary Life
Memberships awarded were two for
Kevin Buckley (Bar Manager) and
Pete Hartley (Snack Bar worker),
who have both contributed beyond the
call of duty towards the smooth
running of the Union Trading
Services.
Norburn
keeps quiet
Professor David Norburn, currently
Professor of Strategic Planning at
Cranfield, is to become Director of
the Imperial College School of
Management. The School of
Management is to be formed by the
merger of the Departments of
Management Science and Social and
Economic Science.
Prof Norburn refused to talk to
FELIX on Tuesday.
Tower tours
The Queen's Tower will be opening
to the public again this summer
despite mixed success last year.
College Assistant Secretary Michael
Arthur told FELIX that a larger
advertising campaign, including
posters on the Tube and reduction in
Tower staff (from 7 to 2) would make
this year's scheme more profitable.
The Tower is expected to attract
5,000 visitors, who will pay 60p for
viewing the Tower and an exhibition
on the Imperial Institute.
Crofton
clanger
There were red faces all round in the
Mechanical Engineering Department
when one of this year's examination
papers was made available for sale to
students in advance. Because of an
"administration error" the 1987
Materials multiple choice paper was
included amongst past papers on sale
in the undergraduate office. Although
a replacement paper was written at
short notice, many candidates were
struck by the similarity between the
replacement and the original paper.
Dr Seamus Crofton, who was
responsible for writing both papers,
said that the mistake would not give
any candidates an unfair advantage
because the answers were not
included with the paper on sale. He
added, the materials exams were
similar every year.
