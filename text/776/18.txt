What's On FELIX, W e d n e s d a y J u n e 2 4 t h 1 9 8 7 1 8
So y o u ' r e w o r k i n g f o r your
sponsoring company, at home with
M u m and Dad or cleaning toilets in
Southside. What do you do with those
lazy, gorgeously warm summer
weekends and evenings? In an effort
to find out what normal people do,
your intrepid F E L I X reporter dressed
up as Norman Bates' mother and
supplies the following suggestions.
London, as usual, is best off with
activities and theatres and cinemas
and parks, with jazz concerts on at
the Barbican such as Count Base on
the 9th July, and also the Beatles
played by the L S O on the 18th and
Gershwin on the 19th July. The Royal
Shakespeare Company are
performing a Romeo and Juliet in
modern dress where Tybalt comes on
stage in a red sports car, and Niamah
Cusack plays Juliet, to rave reviews.
Macbeth is less enthused about, and
only lasts until July 4th anyway, and
Richard II with Jeremy Irons in the
title role is also on until July 8th.
Someone suggested Ronnie Scott's
in Frith Street W l as a fab place for
a night out, but it is exorbitantly
priced in entrance, food and drinks
and the chatter of the punters ruins the
music, so why not go to Tottenham
Court Road Tube for a cool night
listening to jazz. Alternatively the
Notting Hill Carnival, August 30th
and 31st, 11am to 9 p m o r
thereabouts, will supply anyone's
needs in music and visuals with the
usual floats and bands, described by
its organisers as "grand and large
scale". It starts from Ladbroke
Grove.
Summertime
and the livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin'
and the cotton is high
Your mamma's rich
and your papa
he's good lookin'
So hush UV baby
do-ow-own't you cry
Cheapo classical music can be
heard at the Proms, held right next
door at the Royal Albert Hall during
the summer months, with tickets at
dirt cheap prices for those prepared
to squat on the floor and maybe queue
for a couple of hours. Also in
London, in June, the V & A are
opening the new Pirelli Garden
which rumour has it w i l l be
accompanied by music (well they
have to spend the entrance money on
something, though at least they could
have bought flower pots for the
flowers instead of old tyres).
If the weather is fine then Regent's
Park Zoo and the nearby open air
theatre are interesting—the Zoo costs
£3.50 and is well worth it for a day,
the threatre costs £5.50, £4 or more
and is performing A Midsummer
Night's Dream, Bartholomew Fair
and the Two Gentlemen of Verona.
If it rains you can re-book tickets.
There are also open air concerts held
at Kenwood House near Hamstead
Heath, and the London Tattoo at
Earl's Court from the July 8th to
31st—you know, the one where they
pretend to carry the field guns over
a river.
The Royal Academy of Arts is
displaying paintings by amateur and
professional artists from August 6th
to 23rd. You can get in for £1.70 with
your student union card and try and
spot the ones by Prince Charles.
There is all sorts of artistry; sculpture,
oils, watercolours. From July 10th
there is an exhibition of old masters,
and on 20th September there is the
Burlington House Antiques Fair
(two-fifty to anyone else, but to you,
guv, one seventy) where old things
are auctioned and I was assured that
much of it will go for less than £50
a throw.
For the rest of the Isles—well
starting at the top and working down,
there is of course the Edinburgh
Festival and Fringe, graced by the
prsence of Theatre West End, which
lasts from August 9th to 30th. It is
difficult, nay impossible, to get
accommodation in Edinburgh at the
time, so it would be wise to sort it out
now. The Edinburgh Tattoo is held
beneath the castle in the second week
of August.
Glascow boasts a new art gallery,
the Burrell Collection, which people
come from as far afield as Germany
to see, and if you're still bored, why
not visit Hadrian's Wall? It's big
_nough, you can't miss it.
The Youth Hostelling Association
has hostels all over the U K at the
lovely prices of £4 outside London
and £7 in London, plus £6 pa
membership, and the Ramblers also
operate all over the country with
organised walks and advice. Phone
582 6826/6878 to be put in touch with
your local group—the London ones
do Sunday Rambles out of town,
