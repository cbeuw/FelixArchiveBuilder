Despite the fact that the world is
inherently unpredictable, there are
always some things you can rely on:
the student grant will always be
inadequate; the Conservatives will
always win the General Election; and
the accommodation situation at
Imperial College will always be in
crisis...
The year started badly and got
steadily worse, with the news
announced in the first F E L I X of the
autumn term that home PGs were no
longer being allocated places in halls
of residence. This showed how
desperate the accommodation crisis at
IC really was: there was a grand total
of three home PGs in Hall last year.
As usual, the solution to the whole
accommodation problem appeared to
be the building of a new Hall of
Residence above the swimming pool
in Northside. However, the massive
cost of this scheme has always made
this something of a impossible dream.
Even if the money could be found to
build it, there is no doubt that the non-
student inhabitants of the area would
object to its construction, fearful of
a further invasive wave of acne-
covered students, vomiting on the
pavements and wandering around
with no trousers at 3-o-clock in the
morning. With this in mind, the
Rector took the opportunity to ask all
the new students to turn down their
hi-fis and not to indulge in late-night
drunken orgies (unless he was
invited).
There were problems even with the
accommodation that the College had
got, most notably security. College
officials spend so much time
congratulating themselves for
providing students with a roof over
their heads that they forget that they
ought to provide doors as well. IC
Halls of Residence have always been
insecure, and everyone who has ever
lived in them is aware of this.
However, when a woman was
tragically raped on College premises
in Hamlet Gardens in October some
College officials seemed genuinely
surprised that such a thing could
occur. Perhaps one way of waking up
the Imperial Bureaucracy to the
problems would be to set aside a room
in one of the Halls of Residence, and
invite every official who has to take
decisions about security to leave some
valuable item of theirs (camera,
compact disc player etc) locked in it
for a term. After a term the room
would be unlocked, and lo! all their
stuff would have been nicked — then
perhaps something might be done.
The College did respond to the rape,
albeit in a bumbling way, getting the
locks in Hamlet Gardens changed.
Unfortunately they did not give new
keys to the residents or the warden,
who arrived back after a day in
College to find themselves locked out.
The warden ended up doing an SAS
act and climbed in through the
window, while the students, lacking
finesse, smashed the doors in.
Still the charade continued, with
£2000 worth of personal stereos, etc
going missing from Linstead at the
end of November, and another £1000
worth two weeks later. The
equipment was taken from locked
