and a whole

This is the shape
of things to come
Perhaps this page will give you an
idea of what you can expect in F E L I X
next year: the usual accurate news
reporting and quality features but with
a little extra. There will be an attempt
to put the fun back into F E L I X — a n
irreverent look at the College and the
Union: next year's F E L I X aims to be
light-hearted without distorting the
facts.
One of the major improvements
will be in sports coverage. W e hope
to have more third-party reporting
and relevant photos rather than the
sports club articles printed this year.
We also want to include a weekly
fixtures list in order to preview as
well as review matches played. W e
need writers and sports photographers
for this in particular. If you have ever
fancied a job as a sports reporter then
this could be the experience you need!
We already have several features
lined up for the Autumn: Catholic
students and the dilemma o f
contraception; London's hidden
nightlife; life after College (to
coincide with our Careers Issue); and
Sex Special 2—a follow up to a survey
carried out two years ago to see just
if students are really changing their
views and habits in the light of the
new IC GaySoc and the threat of
A I D S . We also welcome any ideas
you may have for features F E L I X
could carry.
F E L I X welcomes all new staff but
especially needs competent writers.
Y o u can specialise in news, sport or
features, or all three if you prefer.
Join our team even if you feel you can
not write well, as there are always
experienced sub-editors who can offer
guidence and correct your style. W e
also need people to collate (the act of
putting folded sheets together in order
to create finished copies of F E L I X )
regularly on Thursday evenings in
return for lively company, a preview
of the paper before the rest of College
sees it, and a drink i n the Bar
afterwards! (We are especially keen
to find early risers who would like to
help with the distibution on Friday
mornings!). If you'd like to give a
hand with these menial, but essential,
tasks then please identify yourself at
our Beit Quad stall at Freshers Fair
next term or, if you're around over
the Summer, pop in to the Office
some time and we'll treat you to a
coffee and a look around the Office.
Above all, we hope to make next
year's F E L I X an enjoyable read and
one which you will want to keep
rather than consign to the dustbin.
There will be only one postgradute
F E L I X out over the Summer due to
the closure of the Print Unit. This will
be out on Friday 14th August. The
copy deadline for this issue is Friday
7th August. The first F E L I X next
term will be out on Monday 5th
October and the copy deadline for
clubs articles, small ads, letters and
features is Monday 28th September.
P R I N T U N I T
Due to staff holidays the Print Unit will be closed from 10th August to 5th
September and no printing will be done between 15th July and 15th
September. All Freshers publicity should be arranged with Judith Hackney
by 1st July otherwise there will be no guarantee that work will be printed
before Freshers Fair. Consider yourself warned!
