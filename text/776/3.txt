A couple of years ago there was a popular theory
that the FELIX Editor could produce the
newspaper single-handed if necessary, and still
do a reasonable job. If FELIX was left to me
and me alone I would struggle to produce four
pages per week. For whatever reason, I seem
to have been blessed with a tireless staff who will
work well into the night regularly to help ring
FELIX out. To these very special people I owe
a million thanks, and an apology if at any time
I have seemed unappreciative of your efforts.
Firstly my thanks must go to Rose Atkins and
Steve Shackell, who between them managed to
keep the office running at times when I must have
seemed close to insanity. Special mention must
be made also of Chris Martin, Pippa Salmon,
Kamala Sen, Judith Hackney, David Burns and
Chris Edwards, who all put in an extraordinary
amount of time on FELIX this year. Very sincere
thanks also to David Rowe, Mark Cottle, Liz
Holford, Rosemary Hosking, Bill Goodwin,
Peter Higgs, Nigel Whitfield, Jane Spiegel,
Aaron Kotcheff, Sunny Bains, David Williams,
Jim Clayden, Neil Motteram, Rachel Black,
