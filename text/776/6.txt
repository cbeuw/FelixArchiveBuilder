Israel: Operation for Peace
Dear Dave,
I feel it is most important to correct
the inaccurate and misleading remarks
of last week's 'Opinion'. The author
of the article began with the premise
that the State of Israel has no right to
exist, and developed from that
position a twisted and distorted
argument.
Let me first consider the necessity
for Operation Peace for Galilee. This
was a response to fourteen years of
PLO terrorist warfare launched
against the northern settlements in
Israel such as Kiryat Shmoneh. The
7,000 PLO terrorists were well
trained and highly armed with
powerful weaponry from all over the
world, including BM21 rocket
launchers capable of firing 40 rockets
simultaneously with a range of 22km.
On July 15th 1981 a systematic
rocket and artillery barrage of
northern Galilee began. In order to
protect its citizens, Israel mounted
Operation Peace for Galilee on June
6th 1982. No country except Israel
has ever taken so many precautions
to avoid civilian casualties. Israel
provided medical aid to Lebanese
civilians which cost $40,000 per day
and included flying patients with
kidney disease to the Haifa Carmel
Hospital. Indeed the figure quoted in
the article of 50,000 casualties in
1982 is totally meaningless. Since the
number of Lebanese civilian
casualties was of the order of 1,000,
I presume the 50,000 is a very
conservative estimate for the number
killed in the Lebanese civil war from
1975 onwards.
Now I should like to describe the
actual situation in Judea and Samaria,
which has recently been coined the
West Bank. In discussing Bir Zeit and
other universities, the author has
conveniently forgotten that until 1967
Jordan had forbidden the
establishment of any universities. The
Israeli Government, however, has
permitted not only Bir Zeit and Beith
Lahem, but three others to be built.
Far from restraining civil liberties the
civilian administration has been
developed. It now numbers 17,000 of
whom 98% are Arab residents. Israel
has invested heavily in water
resources, living conditions, and
health facilities. The life expectancy
has risen from 48 to 62 years, infant
mortality is now one quarter of the
1967 level. The Jewish settlement in
Judea and Samaria is only an issue
because the State of Israel is at issue.
The Jewish population is less than 4%
of the total and owns just 60,000 out
of 1.5 million acres. Arab settlers
have successfully won land disputes
in the Israel Supreme Court.
The figure of 4 million refugees is
again an exageration. There are
1,800,000 Palestinians registered as
refugees, of whom only about
625,000 live in camps. Yet even those
in camps, according to UNRWA
doctors, have low levels of
malnutrition and high levels of
literacy. These Arabs share a
common language and culture with
the citizens of the Arab states.
However, their refugee status has
been calculatedly maintained to serve
these countries' political aims. The
Jordanian daily newspaper Falastin
stated, in 1949, that "The Arab states
which had encouraged the Palestine
Arabs to leave their homes
temporarily, in order to be out of the
way of the Arab invasion armies,
have failed to keep their promise to
help these refugees."
Israel is a peace-loving democratic
country; helping the Arab refugees
more than their own countries have,
she demands no more than the right
to exist. This is the truth.
Yours sincerely,

The President talks bollocks
Dear Dave,
I have just returned from abroad,
to receive a copy of FELIX and read
the opinion article by Al Roberts (Doc
1).
Al seems to have some strange idea
that I was trying to insult him in my
last letter, when I referred to AIDS
in the same sentence as
homosexuality.
I must agree whole heartedly with
many of the statements in his article
as they are identical to those
mentioned in my previous letter. At
the same time I must point out that,
being homosexual, he must come to
terms with the fact that AIDS will
have a large effect on his life.
He claims that promiscuity is a
problem of heterosexuality; this I
must disagree with. He goes further,
to suggest that I am promiscuous and
sex-starved. Well, I have to say that
I am neither, and how he might know
any different I would be interested to
hear.
In his article he states that 60% of
gay men have sex with 0 or 1 person
a month and that only 2 % ' 'make it"
with between 11 and 20 people a
month. This presumably leaves 38%
who "make it" with 2 to 10 people.
Some of these people are sleeping
with more people in a month than I
have in my entire life. I fail to see how
this cannot be promiscuous.
I estimate from his figures that 30%
of gay men have sex with 1 person
a month and note that 40% of all gay
men are promiscuous (ie have sex
with 2 or more people a month; my
personal definition). From these facts
it can be estimated that around 10%
of gay men are having sex once a
month with a promiscuous person. As
a result it will take less than 12
months for nearly every gay person
to have had sex with a promiscuous
person. Taking this into account any
gay person, who is not celibate or
devoted to an AIDS free partner who
is devoted to him, must take AIDS as
a serious threat.
Whether Mr Roberts believes it or
not, I take AIDS very seriously. My
second-to-last relationship was last
summer in Africa, this put me in a
very low risk group, but none-the-less
a risk group. As a result I have had
an AIDS test this year. I feel that
everyone is obliged to go and request
an AIDS test, it's not a lot of fun
sitting and waiting for your results,
not knowing if you are going to live
or die; but at the end of it you know
that you are not going to kill the next
person you make love to.
If members of Gay Soc are not
willing to take the threat of AIDS
seriously then the society itself
becomes a health hazard to its
members and its existance needs
careful examination.
Mr Roberts' article has made me
reconsider my viewpoint on the Gay
Soc. I shall without a doubt be having
further in depth conversations with
Andy Bannister about the matter,
maybe so should you, Mr Roberts.
Yours,
Ian Howgate.
N.B. For information on the sexual
activity, or lack of it, of IC students,
I suggest we all watch these pages for
the imminent Welfare Questionnaire
results.
Dear Dave,
Although Ian's interpretation ofthe
figures given by Al Roberts could be
justified, bear in mind that such
surveys by low-circulation papers
such as Capital Gay are actually very
unrepresentative: I too would be
astonished if 35% of the Gay
population had 2 to 10 partners per
month!

Say noto
conformists
Dear Dave,
I'm always very suspicious when
people use phrases like "It's not
natural". What are they saying? A
friend of mine once complained about
a German girl having hair under her
arms because "It's not natural",
which of course it is. However, this
shows what people really mean when
they say that homosexuality isn't
natural. They mean they don't
approve of it. In the same way that
some religious people can't rest until
everyone loves the same god as they
do, these people want to stamp
everyone conformist.
In some ways, the labels 'gay' and
'straight' aren't helpful, as they imply
that everyone is one or the other,
which isn't the case. 'Straight' is
especially unhelpful, as it is the
opposite of 'bent', and therefore leads
heterosexuals to think of themselves
as 'untainted'. Why not just aim for
a society in which adults can do what
they like with a consenting adult
partner?
I think IC's gays are likely to have
very limited success at changing
people's attitudes here, as most
people's prejudices are well dug-in by
now. Not until homosexuality is
taught as a part of sex education in
schools will many adults refrain from
talking about gays in the same way
as they did in the school playground,
where they first learnt about them.
Afterall, sex education that only
mentions heterosexuality is like
religious education that only mentions
Christianity. The implication is 'This
is what we do and everyone else is
wrong'. Parents who claim that for
a teacher to admit that gay people
exist would be to damage a child's
development, are quite happy to have
the same children watch mindless
violence and death on video.
A catholic aquaintance of mine was
informing me of the damnation gays
were destined for, when I asked him
what someone was supposed to do if
they were born gay. He replied he
didn't believe people were born gay,
but that they chose to act
'unnaturally'. As I pointed out, they
would be choosing intense
persecution, and why would they do
this? His reply was 'Because it's
trendy'. Make of that what you will.
When I see two gays holding hands
in the street, I can feel happy for them
in a way that is difficult when I see
a man and woman together, as this
just reminds me that it's ages since
I had a realy close female friend
myself. My own fault for coming to
Imperial perhaps, or maybe most
women would prefer people such as
'Mr Dork'.
Yours,
Richard G Fincher
