Muff Dive '95?
Getting a soaking in the stocks
It's that time of year again when all you
inventive people out there are invited to think up
an imaginative slogan for next year's Rag
campaign. If you can think of something better
than Beehive '95 or Cattle Drive '95 then plonk
your suggestion on a scrap of paper and put it in
the Rag Pigeonhole. You could just come along
to a Rag meeting and suggest it yourself. You
could win yourself a copy of next year's
merchandise with your slogan on it if your's is
the grooviest suggestion.
Here are some of the past years' slogans to
give you some suggestions:
Fungal Spore '94
Off Your Tree '93
Bug-a-Ewe '92
Elephants Come '91
Rampant Rhino '90
Dragons Divine '89
Lemmings Fate '88
Sheep in Heaven '87
Sabbs in Stocks
Yes, this isn't going to be a joke. In varying
states, the Sabbaticals of the past year have
promised to sit in the stocks so you can throw
something at, them relieving all your frustration.
So you can see that Rag Fete is returning
with a vengeance this year and is due to hit the
Queen's Lawn with a splash on Wednesday 11th
May! For all of you fun loving people this is the
time for a break from revision and having a go
on the Inflatables or the Cocktail Explosion or
tackling some wild animals specially imported
from the Rainforest for the occasion.
If you are in the mood for something a little
quieter then you can stroll up the Queen's Tower
and admire the view whilst munching ice creams
or watch someone performing magic tricks
whilst picking something from a lucky dip.
There is something for everyone, so make
sure you are there or you will miss out on the
biggest event this term. The fun will start at
12pm on the Queen's Lawn so be there.

Art Exhibition at I.C.
Art is not dead a Imperial College!
Staff and students of Imperial College and St.
Mary's Hospital Medical School hold an annual
exhibition of their artwork in the Consort
Gallery (Ante Room, Sherfield). This year, the
Exhibition will be running from 18th May to
17th June.
Entrance is free, so do come and have a look
round when you take that much-needed break
from research or revision. The artwork will be
for sale if want to purchase a piece - the price is
to be negotiated with the artists involved.
The Exhibition is for art by all students and
staff of the College. If you would like to display
you own work then you are most welcome
(subject to availability of space, depending on
the response we get!). All two-dimensional work
must be framed, ready to hang with two eye-
rings attached. If you need help in framing,
please contact Leonardo Society, through the
pigeonholes in the Union Office (first floor of
the Union Building).
Each piece of work must be marked on the
back with artist's name, title of the work and the
price. Please also supply a list of all submitted
pieces with their title, dimensions, medium and
price (forms available from the contacts listed
below).
Please hand in all work on Monday 18th
May, between 10am and 12pm at the Consort
Gallery, Sherfield Building.
