Campus Trials Rejected
BY JOE MCFADDEN
Serious offences such as rape and
sexual assaults should always be han-
dled by the police, according to an
interim report published over Easter.
A task force from the Committee
of Vice Chancellors and Principals
(CVCP) produced the report. The
task force was set up last November
to investigate student disciplinary
procedures following the acquittal
of Austen Donnellan, a King's
College student accused of raping a
fellow student.
Both King's College and the
female student in question wanted
to avoid police involvement, prefer-
ring to resolve the matter internally.
But Donnellan insisted on a court
hearing, and the result attracted
widespread press criticism of the
college's handling of the case.
The report defends the college's
actions, stating that it would be
impractical for universities to
restrict themselves solely to acade-
mic offences. According to the
report the criticisms of King's
involvement of the case were "sim-
plistic", but it did accept that the
more serious offences must be
referred to the police.
The existing codes of student
discipline do not define the limits of
a university's authority in such
cases and the report recommends
that clear procedures should be
drawn up. "In short, we believe it is
not for the victim/complainant to
determine that the matter should be
handled internally rather than exter-
nally" the report states.
It also recommended that univer-
sities should not pursue complaints
of rape where the accused had
already been acquitted in a criminal
court. This is in keeping with the
legal principle of double jeopardy
which forbids a second trial of a
defendant who has already been
tried once.
The interim report has now been
released for consultation, prior to
the final report which is due to be
published early this summer.
Physics Student Suspended
BY MIKE INGRAM
A first year Physics student has
been suspended until the end of the
academic year for anonymously
harassing a female student.
The student sent anonymous and
harassing messages to the female
student for a period of over two
months. The messages were sent by
both electronic mail and by hand-
written notes.
The electronic messages could
not be easily traced as they came
from more than one source. The
student had them sent by fellow
players in a multi-player computer
game, as well as sending them
using other students' accounts.
After a College Disciplinary
hearing on 29th March, the student
was suspended for the misuse of
College computer facilities and for
sending the messages. He has also
been banned from using College
computer facilities. This includes
use for academic purposes.
Because the student used other
people's passwords to gain access
to their accounts, he could have
been prosecuted under Section 1 of
the Misuse of Computers Act 1991.
The maximum sentence for this
crime that a court could impose is
five years imprisonment.
