Southside Shop Discount
i
Students flock to take advantage of the 5% discount after a successful advertising campaign
BY SIMON SHAW
Southside Shop has begun offering
a discount to students after protests
over what some students feel are
unfairly high prices.
All students at Imperial College
are eligible for the 5% discount
which applies after 3pm during the
week. Restricting the discount to
off-peak hours has been justified as
an attempt to avoid long queues.
The discount applies to all goods
on sale other than price-fixed items
such as cigarettes, phonecards and
newspapers.
The discounts began operating
before Easter in response to a stu-
dent petition started by Southside
residents and approved by the
Union Executive Committee. The
petition was in protest to the prices
of some items in the shop com-
pared to other shops in the area.
Manager of Southside Shop,
Ricky Sharp, told Felix that "a
couple" of students had asked for
the discount since the scheme had
been in operation. With the shop
receiving approximately a thou-
sand customers a day during term
time, a lack of advertising may be
the reason for the slow uptake.
The system is not without its
problems. At present, cash tills in
the shop are not able to apply the
discount to individual items and
sub-totals. This leads to problems
when students are buying both dis-
counted and price-fixed items. Mr
Sharp said they would "more than
likely be changing the tills".
Further changes are currently being
discussed by College Catering
Services.
The present discounting proce-
dure is still in its infancy and M r
Sharp said that he is always willing
to talk to students and listen to
their suggestions on matters relat-
ing to the Shop.
Export
Award
Imperial College has been given
The Queen's Award for Export
Achievement.
The Award has been granted as
a result of a 40.9% increase in
overseas income to £19,877,000 in
1992/93 from £14,106,000 during
1991/92. This income is primarily
from overseas research contracts
and grants and fees from overseas
students.
This is the second time that
College has gained this award. The
first was in 1990 for its £4.5 mil-
lion increase in income from the
Export of U K Services (Invisible
Exports) during 1986-89.
The Rector, Sir Ronald
Oxburgh, said: "We are delighted
to have received this award for the
second time. It gives particular
pleasure because it demonstrated
the international recognition of the
College's excellence in both teach-
ing and research."
Marathon
The Felix staff would like to con-
gratulate Marcus Krackowizer on
his achievement in this year's
London Marathon.
Mr Krackowizer, a third year
Aeronautical Engineering student,
completed the Marathon in a
wheelchair with a time of 2 hrs 56
mins and 57 sees. This put him
36th in the overall positions.
Mr Krackowizer performed his
own training for the race and, in
conjunction with the College
Disabilities Office, raised sponsor-
ship to go toward medical research.
Hot Cross Suns
BY MIKE INGRAM
The Electrical Engineering building
was burgled over Easter.
On 3rd April, the door of room
1005 was found forced open. Nine
Sun workstations, worth a total of
£45,000, were missing.
A week later, on 10th April, at
approximately 6pm, a man was
spotted by a shift engineer carrying
two heavily laden bags. Security
were called in. They challenged the
man who fled, leaving the bags
beside a skip by the Royal College
of Music. The man was caught on
Queensgate and brought back to
College, where police officers from
Chelsea, Belgravia, Kensington and
Diplomatic Protection divisions
were waiting. One of the Patrol
Officers called found eight more
Sun workstations in the bags.
The man is currently on bail
after being questioned in connection
with both burglaries.
A week before the first break-in,
approximately £30,000 worth of
computer hardware was stolen from
the Physics department. Other
University of London colleges have
also experienced similar burglaries,
suggesting an organised criminal
campaign.
College security has also arrest-
ed one of a gang of three people
seen trying to break into cars to
remove their phones. This occured
during the World Occupational
Therapy Congress held at Imperial
College two weeks ago. The arrest
occurred on Cromwell Road after a
sighting of one of the gang the day
after they were first spotted.
Security are urging people
responsible for valuable equipment
to ask for advice on protecting it
from theft. They are also reminding
people to make sure their offices
and cars are locked and to report
anything suspicious to Sherfield
Security on extension 3372.
