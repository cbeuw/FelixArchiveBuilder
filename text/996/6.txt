P a r a n o i a
by Aaysha Shah
The mountains of fat rolled off her
As she lolloped along
At her snail pace
Carrier bags in each hand.
Breathless
Restless
As the blood pulsated through her ears.
Someone stared
Someone sniggered.
She could hear them.
Feel them
As they held out their thin spindly
Fingers,
Trying to grab her, and pull her back.
To get her
And display her, an object of their
ridicule.
She had decided to go to the fair
Have a bit of a change for once
She'd enjoy the rides
The smells
Maybe she'd even eat something
But she daren't
In case they'd mind.
The controllers of her world.
She knew what they'd say
"Have a little too much to eat dear."
"I hope you don'tfeel sick."
"Never knew they allowed 20 tonnes on the
Ferris Wheel."
"You must know what it feels to he a heavy
goods vehicle."
"So what are the new fashions in size 28?"
"Roll up, roll up,
See the fattest lady in the world
20 chins in one go.
Roll up for the time of your life."
"GO ON A DIET."
She'd always felt like a freak
Like the ones they used to put in cages
In old days.
When they'd come and stare through
the bars
Laugh at your face
Laugh when you cry, laugh when you care
What they say, laugh when you don't.
It didn't matter whether you were in a
cage or not.
You were still the freak
Living in a society of fat people
Knowing only fat people
Forming the weakest of bonds with
The outside world.
She imagined them
All the fat people in the world
Rounded up.
Left on a desert island
On exile, to loose weight
Sentenced by the slim people
Society rid of size 20+.
And fat old spinsters
And heart attacks
And the fat hairy men
But she didn't care anymore
She ate, and ate, and ate
No one could stop her.
She didn't care if they talked behind her
back.
They're all PARANOID she thought.
