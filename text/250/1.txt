UNIMPRESSIVE LORDS AT
COMMEM. DAY
Inquorate meeting
Where is Mike?
Garga elected to Council
The Leukaemia Research Fund is to be I.C.s carnival charity ;
the Union Executive are to tighten up on discipline; and Vinod
Garga is to be the sixth floor rep. on council. These main points
emerged from thefirstI.C. Union meeting of the year. It was a quiet
inquorate affair, with an attendance of perhaps 250.
The meeting began three minutes late, with Mike Tait still ad-
justing a tie he had hastily borrowed from the floor, and the minutes
and letters to the Union were read out while he discreetly munched his
picnic lunch— a fair comment on Mooney meals. Among the letters
was one from Frank Morris, ex-president of the Wooden Horse Club.
" Two I.C. patriots " had removed an unguarded Mike, from Com-
mittee room A to demonstrate its vulnerability and he apologized for
its temporary disappearance. After this came the election for floor
rep on council to fill the place vacated by C.C. Parker's exam failure.
Vinod Garga, proposed by Andy Jordan, was unopposed.
New Associates being presented
to the Chairman of the
Governing Body.
Carnival Charity
Three charities were nominated
for the Carnival Fund. Ian Wells
spoke on behalf of the Cancer
Research Fund, Chris O'Donnell
for the Leukaemia Research.
Fund, while the Chairman of
I.R.C. Joan Ruddock, delivered
an impassioned and fluent speech
for Andy Jordan's " mixed bag "
of Oxfam and ICSASAF. As far
as could be judged, the Leukae-
mia Fund was voted in by a large
margin, although the exact results
were not announced, Its merits
are twofold; it is readily accept-
able to the general public, but has
not been as yet overexposed.
Discipline
Ray Phillips put aside his mood
of gay banter, in revealing the
new disciplinary policy. The full
text of the " ban-the-boozers"
measures are given elsewhere in
FELIX; in general, the meeting
appeared to be in agreement.
As for last year's accounts,—
which should, under union bye-
laws be presented at the first
union meeting of the next year—
they have not yet appeared. They
should also, under these bye-laws,
be presented to the Rector by the
end of October; but whether they
will be is another matter.
Martin lacks
initiative
It is reported that one day the
week before last five college
members were passing by the
illegal subterranean route into
Southside when they were ob-
served by a security guard—four
escaped unidentified, but the
fifth, "Mike Smith" (??), was
caught and " severely repri-
manded."
Mackman
R C S Ents
Bob Mackman was sworn in as
RCS President on the 24th of
October at one of the liveliest
RCSU meetings for some time.
As a result of vigorous and
well organised campaigns by both
candidates there was a high poll
giving a final result of 442 votes
for Mr. Mackman and 372 for
Frank Fuchs.
After the Union meeting Bob
said that he thought that this
year's Union would be healthy
and strong both with regard to
serious matters and to more light-
hearted affairs—the latter being
amply demonstrated in the Union
meeting. Frank was naturally
disappointed at having lost but
intends to. put forward some of
his policies at future Union
meetings.
Mike Tait, the Vice-President,
opened the meeting and quickly
swept aside most of the serious
business—the presentation to him
of a wooden spoon appropriated
from " some women's college,"—
so that he could announce the
election result and subject the
new president to a long and tortu-
ous inaugurate ceremony. For
this Mackman had to strip and
don a green towel—the cere-
monial uniform—run three times
round the lecture theatre holding
Theta aloft, enter a drinking con-
test (which he won), with cham-
pion beer swiller Steve Moffat, be
painted in RCS colours, make an
impromptu speech about carrots
and, after adopting an extremely
vulnerable position on the lecture
theatre bench, shout a Kangela,
which was not very rousing, and
inaccurate.
After the hilarity had faded,
Malcolm " Spooks" Duckett,
Chairman of RCS Ents got up to
explain that he had tried unsuc-
cessfully to resign. He had done
Victorious
disheartened
this because he was disillusioned
with RCSU as a result of the lack
of active support the Ents Com-
mittee had received in the past.
He complained that too many
people, for instance FELIX, were
too inclined to criticising and not
enough to helping. He did not
see why all the work of the Union
should be loaded on to a few
people.
The meeting then swung back
into its light-hearted and frivolous
mood of a few minutes before
with the announcement of the
sequel of the " Queen of Jez"
The gentlemen of the audience
were as reticent and shy as the
ladies had been the previous week
until several beefy females started
to haul members of the Exec,
from their seats. The competitors
paraded across the front of the
theatre displaying their knees after
the fashion of the Mr. ICWA
contest ranged from Jeff Warren
clad in rather less than trousers,
to Pete Hall, Chairman of RCS
clubs committee with the knob-
bliest knees on view. Pete Hall,
was therefore judged the winner
and awarded the title "King of
Jez."
U C S A S A F
It was reported in the Guardian
on Tuesday 24th October that
U.C. has started a U.C.S.A.S.A.F.
(University College South African
Student Appeal Fund.)
What should LC.'s reacdon be
to this revolutionary idea? Should
we send them the £150 so far
collected for I.C.S.A.S.A.F. or
just advise them in a paternal
way against the whole scheme?
The fragile basis tor the Com-
memoration Day ceremony broke
down under the weight of two
uninspiring speeches by the Rec-
tor and Lord Kings Norton, the
special visitor, last Thursday
afternoon.
An assembly of 2.000 or so—
conspicuous tor the sparsity ot
students not being presented—
watched the splendour of the
procession of dignitaries to the
platform while the choir sang the
stirring " Gaudeamus Igitur";
heard Martin Lack, the student
orator, read the proclamation;
watched the ACGFs presented to
the chairman of the Delegacy and
the ARCS's, ARSM's and DICs
to Lord Sherfield, Chairman of
the Governing Body; heard the
citations and watched the presen-
tation of diplomas to Lady Lin-
stead, honorary Diplomate of
Imperial College, Professor
Blackett, Sir Charles Goodeve,
Professor Sir Ewart Jones, Pro-
fessor McCrea, Dr. Mitchell and
Mr. Newby, all Fellows of Im-
perial College.
So far so good ; a bit of a drag
during the presentation of Asso-
ciates and DIC's, watching an
endless stream of people walk to
the middle of the platform, stop,
and walk on, broken only by the
occasional lady, whose curtsey re-
ceives a doff of the cap.
Then came the Rectors' ad-
dress, surely the shortest in
both time and content for many
years. Briefly he said that we
have almost come to the end of
the era of rapid expansion and
are now entering a new one of
consolidation. In this era the
main effort must be to work more
closely with industry, to train
scientist and technologists for in-
dustry, and to stimulate a greater
flow of ideas between the two.
On the occasion of the Rector's
first official appearance one would
have expected a rather more
comprehensive idea of the direc-
tion in which he intends to lead
Imperial College.
A pleasant interlude followed
while the choir sang an excerpt
from Cantata No. 21 by Bach
and the Chairman of the Govern-
ing Body was welcoming Lady
Linstead, Lord Penney and the
special visitor, Lord Kings
Norton spoke for only about a
quarter of an hour. In many
ways his theme was an extension
of the Rector's , that we must
train more scientists for industry
However his main interest was in
the creation of an educative
structure which would channel
the right minds into pure or ap-
plied science or into manage-
ment. He envisaged a very much
broader education at the secon-
dary school level, with little or no
specialisation until university.
This he hopes will reduce the gap
in understanding between artists
and scientists, so making them
more tolerant of and co-operative
with one another. His other
main point was that we are not
being selective enough in our pur-
suit of scientific knowledge. He
believes that we should be much
more selective in our targets of
applied research, carefully weigh-
ing the benefits which wit! accrue
against the cost of the project,
and more selective in the people
engaged for pure research.
He summed up his speech:
" My thesis, broadly, is that we
absorb knowledge too narrowly',
in our youth, and that we extend!.;
its boundaries too carelessly latef;
on.
Lucid as this speech was, he
presented no original ideas, nor
did he elaborate on the well-
known ideas that he did present.
In fact it consisted of a succes-
sion of vague generalities along
the lines just mentioned, offering
not a scrap of evidence to support
his views.
The indifference of the two
main speeches leads one to ask
what is the purpose of Commem-
oration Day ? The origins of it
have little relevance to the pre-
sent day (it commemorates the
visit of King George VI and
Queen Elizabeth in 1945) serving,
so it seems, merely as an excuse
for a presentation ceremony. But
is it just a presentation ceremony
with a couple of speeches thrown
in to add weight ? Surely not.
The Rector's address is his only
official annual delivery to the col-
lege as a whole, and as such is
an important, occasion in its own
right. One would expect at least
a general outline of policies.
No wonder so few students
attend when the occasion seems
to have so little relevance to
them.
