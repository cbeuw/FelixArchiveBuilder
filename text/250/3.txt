This week, for the first time in some years, there appears in
Felix a column for each of the constituent colleges. Following
ICWA's lead with ICWords, Guilds, Mines and RCS have produced
GUILDSPOT, GENTLEMEN OF MINES and MACKMANIA-
long may they live.
G U I L D S P O T
Welcome to our first Guilds
column of this year which we are
delighted to open by categorically
stating that Guilds still have
Spanner. Despite rumours to the
contrary, which even reached the
pages of FELIX, Guilds never
lost Spanner—certainly not to
such an outlandish spot as
Northern Poly ! Somehow, some-
where, someone must have
started thisfiendishrumour, the
details of which are still not clear
and which struck dread into our
spanner bearers who were in im-
minent danger of tarring and
feathering! Actually, much
praise in due to our mascot men
and their team of maniac car-
drivers who by their ingenuity
and timing defeated all attempts
by R.C.S. and Mines to capture
Spanner.
The Guilds Freshers Dinners
are now over. We hope everyone
who came enjoyed themselves,
particularly as the majority of the
dinners this year were mixed !
This is a very pleasant change in
Guilds and just in casa there is
anyone who hasn't realised it yet,
Guilds have twelve girl freshers
this year—so the total number of
girls is now trebled. There has
apparently been a similar in-
crease in R.C.S.—'this, of course,
makes no difference to their chant
for which, I am told, the correct
beginning is " Ladies of R.C.S.,
are we in good voice ?"
The Guilds calendar is pretty
full in the next couple of weeks
— to-day of course being the
event of the year—MORPHY
DAY ! So Guildsmen assemble
in your cast of thousands, cheer
our boat crews to victory and
then let battle commence !
Remember also that we need
lots of support to get Bo off to a
good start on the Brighton Run
next Sunday—and of course to
welcome Bo in Brighton at the
Motor Club lunch.
The next big day is the Lord
Mayor's Show on November 11th.
—we have been asked to supply
programme sellers, so let Guilds
have your names for both events
as soon as possible.
G E N T L E M E N O F M I N E S
Under the capable and enthusi-
astic leadership of President Ian
Wells, Mines Union has got off to
a very active start this session.
There has been a good turnout to
the freshers' dinners, though not
the 100 per cent hoped for. This
is a pity as the freshers do get
their meal and entertainment free
—and only have to drink the beer
and attempt to drain the yard of
ale in return.
New ideas, some thought up in
previous sessions but never put
into practice and some from this
year, have now come into action.
A Hot Drink vending machine,
will shortly be installed in the
Mines Building—this in response
to a survey conducted at the be-
ginning of term. A new notice
board, for use by the Sports Club
and badly needed for years, has
now been erected. The Union
Office is at last in use, and Bar
Socials, held on Wednesday even-
ings in the Union, are now in full
swing and give Minesmen a
chance to meet over a quiet (?)
pint.
Sport is flourishing with a lot of
new talent and the steady support
of the old lags. Mines should win
the race on Morphy Day again
and the end of season should see
the Engineers' and Sparke's Cups
and the Bottle once again back in
Mines.
Visits to foreign Mining Schools
are off to an early start. Mines
are being represented in Delft,
Holland and Trondheim, Norway,
in early November. Preparations
for the return visit in December
are well under way.
This may well be a year to
eclipse all others.
For the progressive element amongst I.C. students, Felix
examines three of the outfits on the " avant garde " bandwagon.
SHADES OF THE
UNDERWORLD
The Experimental Arts Lab. is exactly what it says it is, or so it
reckons. Hoping to succeed where Indica and others failed, as a
solvent centre for original art-work, their primary hang-up is ade-
quatefinance.However, even if you're broke, you're welcome, espec-
ially if you've got ideas or things that might help them create a
" groovy environment."
The " lab " consists of a small theatre, a cinema and concert
area, an art and environmental area, a bookshop, a restaurant and a
home for a film production unit. You can visit any day. except
Monday.
182 Drury Lane.
Process
The Process exists to discuss
anything, but the subjects tend to
be predictable. LSD, Road to
Heaven or Chemical death ? for
instance, and their 3-cornered
intellectual battle, " Game of the
Gods," featuring the voices of
Jehovah, Lucifer and Satan, each
given an evening to put over his
case. The views of the Gods are
expensive, however, and it will
cost you 7/6 to hear Satan close
the trilogy this Friday. Most of
this, no doubt, goes to pay for
the Processes' excessively sump-
tuous headquarters in Mayfair,
subsidised also by their Process
Sessions—-a course designed to
increase one's personal communi-
cation with others and to improve
one's self-awareness, ending with
evenings of courageous self-dis-
covery,findingblinding visions of
God, coupled with the stench of
infinite corruption . . . the blurb
says it much better than I, please
get one (they're free) from the
Process, 2, Balfour PL, W.l.
Yoko Ono
Yoko Ono—J life, \ space ex-
hibition at the Lisson Gallery,
Bell Street, N.W.I. The usual
Yoko Ono nothing ? It's difficult
to make objective comments ex-
cept that the exhibition is a com-
ment on our \ communication
and Jr experiences and consists of
4 environments, including one,
titled Back-yard, which turns out
to be exactly that (including
Rain, courtesy of Yoko Ono, if
you're lucky). Yoko Ono (of
" Bottoms " fame) says she at-
tempts to "make music within
your own mind " which is per-
haps her way of describing what
artists have always done, any-
way, if you don't get too cynical
it can happen. Closing date Nov.
14, don't miss it.

Of course with everyone so in-
volved in the Presidential election,
there's been plenty of stirring
going on on behalf of each of the
candidates. However, that's all
old hat now, and since we have,
at last, a real live President, things
should settle down to their more
usual steady pace.
What did you all think of
" Spooks" and his dramatic ap-
peal? It was truly sincere, not a
put-up job, and he reports that a
few stony hearts were touched, so
for these and any other interested
people he hopes to be getting the
designs for the flats soon and will
be asking for help in painting
them via the notice boards.
If you haven't been put off by
" Spooks" there still remain a
few union posts. Now Bob is
President, the position of Hon.
Sec becomes vacant, and Roger
Webb is favourite for this. This
will, of course, be very nice for
our Asst. Hon. Sec, Linda Mar-
tin, since they got engaged at the
beginning of term. Or perhaps
the newly created post of Officer
for Academic Affairs is more in
your line. The idea is that he
should co-ordinate the activities
of the student members of the
staff-student commitees and be
responsible for collecting informa-
tion about academic matters.
Then, after Ian Chapman's
resignation, there's the job of
Physics Dept. Rep. It entails
Newest member of the R.C.S. Fire Crew is Paddy, this year's
Queen of Jez. 3
passing information to and from
year reps, sitting on the Physics
Academic Sub-Committee, on the
R.C.S. General Committee and
generally keeping the wheels oiled
in the Physics Dept. If you're an
organisation man, perhaps this is
for you. Or, if you're artistically
inclined, i.e. have a penchant for
drawing half-clad birds, the pub-
licity officer would appreciate
your help as a member of his
committee.
I know it's been said before,
but the Union is what you make
it. It can't operate in a vacuum,
so get up S.A.M. and get in-
volved.

Dun Smith is a top executive in the Metropolitan Police.
A Superintendent at 34 he now commands over200 men
and women, including C.I.D. men, administrators and civilians.
Today at 36 his total income is £2865
There's a quiet revolution going on in the
police service. You may have noticed it. But
it's not just things like new equipment or better
pay. It's a whole series of fundamental changes
aimed at meeting the challenge of the next
decade.
The intellectual demands of a police career begin
from the moment you join. You need to be something
of a lawyer. A psychologist. A quick thinker. And very
often a diplomat. The first two years are vital prepar-
ation for the time when you could command hundreds
of police, detectives, fingerprint-experts, technicians-
and equipment worth many thousands. It's a World of
new ideas in which the man of ability is expected to take
executive responsibility much earlier than in industry.
New deal for Graduates.
For the first time the police have introduced a special
scheme of entry for graduates. It aims to attract young
men who have the education and character to rise
quickly to command-level with big responsibilities —
and pay to match. You can find out before you commit
yourself to join whether you have the potential to rise
above the rank of Inspector early in your career. Two-
day special interviews to select up to 20 such grad-
uates will be held in the second week of January 1968.
We should expect you to gain your first promotion in
your third year, spend a year at the Police College, and
become an inspector in your fifth year.
If you are leaving university in 1968 think about a
police career now. Join at 21 and you step into the
£1,000-a-year class right away. Post this coupon today.
