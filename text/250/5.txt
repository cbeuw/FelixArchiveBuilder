FELIX 5
LORD PENNEY
Amidst almost regal proclamations from every college notice
board, Lord Penney took up his appointment as Rector of IC on
Monday the 16th of October. To find out how heticksand how he
thinks we tick, Felix went to his utilitarian office on the second floor
of the Beit building for a "coming up" interview.
Seated comfortably around a
table we asked Lord Penney,
whose general demeanour is of
slow, easy-going, good humour,
the following questions :
Q. What kind of life did you lead
as a student and were you
active in student affairs ?
A. I was at college between 1927
and 1931, studied maths in the
Huxley building. I lived in
rather poor digs and played
soccer and cricket for both
RCS and IC.
When asked if his legendary
100 per cent for his degree was
for all papers, he said that he
didn't know but in his time high
marks were easily come by in
Maths, by the best students.
Q. In 1934, H. G. Wells said,
" The struggle to blend techni-
cal equipments with a carefully
cherished illiteracy, an inate
oafishness about fundamental
things has been well sustained.
South Kensington will tell you
proudly, " we are not literary,"
and explain almost anxiously
that the last thing it wants to
impart is a liberal education.
. . . Imperial College has no
firm idea of what it is and what
it is supposed to do. That is
to say, it has no philosophy.
It has no philosophical organ-
isation, no social idea, no
rationalised goal, to hold it
together." Do you think,
Lord Penney, that this image
was, and is, fair ?
A. There was some justification
for what Wells wrote in 1934.
In that era the effects of the
depression were still being felt.
There was little general under-
standing of science and tech-
nology and there was a deep
revulsion of war. Scientists
could not easily find jobs and
could only see themselves get-
ting a post for which their de-
gree would be a specialist
qualification. However, this is
nowhere near the mark to-day,
and does not apply to IC. The
young people of to-day are
much more aware of things
around them. I would, to-day,
rather criticise the humanities
and arts for their ignorance
and disinterest in science and
technology, rather than the
other way round.
OUR FUTURE ?
Q. How do you foresee the de-
velopment of the college to
keep abreast of technological
progress ?
A. The purpose of the college
must remain to educate stu-
dents in fundamentals and in
research, but it is important
that industry and colleges of
technology come closer to-
gether.
UNION
Q. IC has a very active student
union. How do you view this
union as an autonomous body?
A. I think that it is important
that there should be an ex-
change of ideas between myself
and students and I want to
listen and talk to students. I
think that student representa-
tion is important .although it
need not always be by students.
Q. The Union has been over-
spending for the last few years.
Do you consider this to be in-
dicative of a responsible stu-
dent body ?
A. I don't know the details of the
situation, but I am fully in
favour of student activities.
We shouldn't curtail an active
union simply because we can't
balance the books. I would
like to leave thefinanceside as
far as possible to the students,
who seem to be very capable.
Lord Penney refused to be
drawn on the subject of his con-
nections with the field of nuclear
power and said that he could not
offer a considered opinion on the
subject of the government':; in-
crease of fees to overseas stu-
dents, so Felix went on to ask
him if he thought that the Uni-
versity of London had any rele-
vance to IC. Lord Penney replied
that the same question was being
asked in his college days but UL
should be thought of in some
ways as a confederation whose
members had common ties in
such fields as education, finance
and building policy.
HALLS
Q. It is generally agreed that
there are too few hall places
for students. Are there any
plans to improve this and can
you give us your views on the
situation ?
A. Well, of course there are
plans to improve the position,
but there are many problems
of financs and space involved.
I think that students who are
not in hall lose a great deal.
On this .encouraging note the
interview ended.
Before him Lord Penney has,
as I see it, two tasks—on the one
hand to maintain in the College
that degree of academic excel-
lence for which it is renowned,
producing at the end of their
courses adults capable of making
full use of their training to lead
the world's advancing techno-
logy ; and on the other hand to
foster the improving awareness of
teacher and taught within the col-
lege, as it is only by a mutual
understanding that the ever-
growing courses may be success-
fully absorbed in the all too short
time available.
To maintain a sense of pur-
pose—and to achieve that pur-
pose—at a time when the de-
mands of industry are so rapidly
changing would tax the greatest
of men, and with this chal-
lenge before him we of ICU
wish Lord Penney every success
in his time with us.
Executive
Action
Following the meeting on Monday, 16th October, the Union
Executive is'-iel the following statement on discipline:
The disciplinary measures open to the Executive Committee for
misbehaviour (especially in the Southside Bar) are:
Put beer prices up another 2d.
Ban individuals.
Stop sales of draught beer.
Close the bar.
The dction taken will consist of:
(1) Banning individuals from the Union. (This includes the
Union Buildings and facilities.) If the individual is a
member of a club, that club and the relevant Clubs
Committee will be informed. If the ban is ignored
financial support will be withdrawn from the club for
the period of the ban.
(2) For misbehaviour in the Bar, the Executive Committee
will first ban individuals from the Bar, displaying
names of banned individuals, and then close the Bar
early, with an explanation. A lower standard of
behaviour will be tolerated in the Union Bar than in
Southside, as it is hoped to maintain the latter as a
lounge bar.
Some other subjects were also
discussed at the meeting. It
transpired, for instance, that—
—after a prolonged period of ru-
mours—Guss of Southside Bar
fame has now replaced Howard
as head barman at the Union.
Howard will remain as an ordin-
ary barman. The Union will also
have a set of shutters, in South-
side Bar style. On the question
of finance, it seems that the
Union accounts last year fell to
a deficit of £1,140, which it is
hoped will be written off by the
College.
Between 1964 and 1967, a total
of £5,000 was drawn from the
Sports Centre fund by successive
Executives, while the College also
earmarked for the Union an
additional £1,500 in 1966. A
new grant from the College, a
sum of 17/6 per head of Union
members, should ensure that the
Union account will be in the
black by the .end of the year.
Other assorted topics: the card
check at Hops is to be tightened
up ; Hops are to be allowed in
the lounge only on occasion
(probably twice a term); and the
Union Lounge Bar is to be open
on Tuesdays, Firdays, Saturdays
and Sundays.
Sir,
Last year, quite a lot was heard
about the department and year
which sold the most number of
raffle tickets for Carnival. May
I suggest that a similar scheme be
adopted for money collected in
tins and perhaps a small prize be
given for the department-year
which collects most per head. In
this way even more enthusiasm
could be aroused than last year
by inter-College rivalry.
Tin-collecting can become
very effective if people are ap-
proached and asked for rnoney.
* M. B. ROGERS
Geology II
Sir,
Cedcijtt has again offended
some members of the College;
this time it is a minority—the
women. Does he really want us
to take this insult lying down?
Although no survey into virgin
territory will be conducted
amongst Icwarians, the magni-
tude of objections received indi-
cate that he's got his vital statistics
wrong. To quote somefigures:
less than one per cent of the wo-
men at I.C. fail to complete their
course and this is due to the usual
reason—inability to satisfy the
examiners' requirements.
Please, Colcutt, watch /our
step next time.
JANE E. PEARSON,
President ICWA
Sir,
For the second year running
your column has continued to
propagate the popular misconcep-
tion that to belong to the Drama-
tic Society means exam failure.
Estimates vary of the average
College failure rate, but 10 per
. cent seems an acceptedfigure.Of
fifty members who joined Drain.
Soc. last September and remained
active throughout the year three
failed to return this October.
This six per cent were active not
only in DramSoc but in other
societies and committees as well.
Similarly for the last eight years
at least—it may be more—no
president-elect has failed to re-
turn to take up office.
Admittedly when one considers
the time that DramSoc members
spend on providing College func-
tions with light and sound, quite
apart from our own productions,
one might expect a higher failure
rate—but this is not the case.
Such a slur can only harm the
Society's reputation and its re-
cruiting. I hope you will ack-
nowledge your inaccuracy and
help to stop this rumour circu-
lating further.
MARTIN CLARKE
ICDS President
FELIX:
Editors
At a meeting of the Felix
Board on Tuesday, 17th October,
a solution was found to the Edi-
torial problem—the Board ap-
pointed an Editor for each term
of the session. Rory Redmayne
will be EditOr until Christmas ;
he will be succeeded in the Easter
and Summer terms by Dave
Cooper, at present Felix Business
Manager, and Dave Potter, last
summer's Editor, respectively.
Ed,—I should like to acknow-
ledge all the hard work put in by
the two Daves and John Mullaly,
the Assistant Editor, to keep the
paper going while a permanent
editor was found.
