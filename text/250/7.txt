David Martin is a lecturer in Sociology in the London School of
Economics, so I suspect he knows what he is talking about when he
addresses "the general reader " in his book " A Sociology of English
Religion " (published by Heinemann, 1967). Here is a sentence from
his book : " Let it be said quite simply that in the course of a year
nearly one out of every two Britains will have entered a church, not
for an event in the life cycle or for a special personal or civic occasion,
but" for service within the ordinary pattern ot institutional religion.''
A truly staggering thought,—but one which will make the "Jeremiahs"
who bewail the " Christian decline " wince!
It may be that your clever sixth-form science master has told you
that " Scientists don't believe in God " and things to that effect. You
may have had some sort of connection with the " local church " back
home, and in the vastness and anonymity and impersonality of your
new surroundings you may be inclined to drift into an aimlessness
as the practice of your faith is concerned.
Christian community in Imperial
College is composed of the Chris-
tian Union, the Methodist,
Roman Catholic and Anglican
(C of E) chaplaincy.
William Temple—a former dis-
tinguished Archbishop of Canter-
bury—once remarked that the
Church was the only society
which existed solely to serve the
needs of those who are outside its
membership. I should very much
hope that in Imperial College the
Church is seen to serve the needs
of all the members of the College.
The entire College exists as a unit
—domestic, administrative, aca-
demic staff; post graduates;
undergraduates; porters; etc. etc.
Christianity at I.C.
I just want you to know that in
Imperial College there exists a
vigorous, articulate and engaging
community of Christian men and
women, who have no illusions
whatever of the moral courage
and integrity required to persist in
the Christian faith. This com-
munity of faith is to be found in
every Hall of Residence, in every
department of the College, and its
members will be found to be
deeply and genuinely engaged in
all the areas of college life—
sports, academic, social, political
and whatever else is going!f
. The
The Church is set within the en-
tire College to serve as its willing
servant. We are not in the Col-
lege to further mere " spiritual"
ends. We are in the College to
" humanise " the entire structure.
If you want to learn how to grow
and develop as a HUMAN BE-
ING, then join the Church in the
College.
Human beings care and care
even when it costs them greatly to
do so. There can be no area of
College life which the church
can regard as outside her task.
I hope that you will feel perfectly
free to make use of the facilities
and opportunities provided by the
church in the College to further
" humanisation."
If you happen to be a Christian,
then be up and doing. The Cpl-
lege/
needs the church and you can
do your best to contribute to its
life. If you are not a Christian
have no fear of being pressurised
into a " religious " groove. The
only groove the church can oper-
ate in is the " human groove." In
Imperial College you have the
freedom and the facilities of lead-
ing your own life. You haven't
got your parents, your school-
masters or even your local vicar
to breathe down your neck! This
freedom can result either in an
aimless drifting into complete
purposelessness or it could be
directed into a deep and genuine
sense of human responsibility. I
believe that 'the church in the
College can be a great help in
shaping your choice in this matter.
So it's up to you!
Lit Soc's
Reactionaries
By restricting its intended dis-
cussion to European Reactionary
Writers, the re-formed Literary
Society at a recent meeting suc-
ceeded in confining its actual dis-
cussion to the realms of politics
and philosophy. The foundation
for the evening was laid by M.
Jean Conrad, who traced the evo-
lution of reactionary thought from
the Renaissance period through
the French Revolution and up to
the last World War; he was par-
ticularly successful in illustrating
the influences of the reactionaries
on one another. In the lengthy
discussion which followed, an at-
tempt was made at categorising
them in order to discuss the roots
of the movement, but this was
not pursued as it was believed
impossible.
Tinkers at IC Folk
ICWords: On Virgins
Does Colcutt speak from experience when he says that less
than 60 per cent of lCwarians are virgins? 1 think this is unlikely.
What business is it of Colcutt's anyway? It is the attitude of him and
others like him that give I.C. a bad name among women. Just
because there are so few women it doesn't mean that all girls are
nymphomaniacs. It is common knowledge that headmistresses advise
their " gels " against coming to I.C. Probably because of the large
excess of men and tales of " Over 40 per cent of the women aren't
virgins " etc. etc. The shortage of women at I.C. is not only due to
" all science " and difficult courses but also to many girls being
" warned " off. If people like Colcutt would stop making such gross
generalizations everyone would realize that ICwarians are the same as
other undergraduate women and perhaps our female population would
increase.
IClothes
We go to College in the heart
of Kensington which is full of
boutiques (and not all expensive),
we get a " reasonable " grant and
this is probably the only time in
our lives when we can dress
exactly as we like, then why, oh
why do ICwarians dress so un-
originally? There are exceptions
I know and to them I apologise
but so many wear a sweater and
skirt in " sensible " colours. Why
not splash out and buy or make a
new outfit (ICWA has a sewing
machine). Wear it to College in-
stead of saving it for best and
cause a sensation!
Mr. 1CWA
Finally latest news of Mr.
ICWA. Nominations were very
slow in coming and in fact at the
moment only two people have
been fully nominated and secon-
ded. These are Pete Franklin
and C. R. Penycate. Other nomi-
nees who have yet to be seconded
are Dick James, A. Friend and
I. E. Wells. There should have
been a better response than this.
Are no members of the Rugby
Club going to stand? Nomina-
tions must be in by Nov. 5th and
the election will take place on
Nov. 7th. All ICwarians are
urged to attend what could be a
very entertaining general meeting.
The folk season in the upper
refectory began with a visit from
the Tinkers, the popular Irish folk
group. The group has been to-
gether for a year and a half, and
consists of Maureen Kennedy-
Martin from London, Gerry Fox
from Tyrone who plays the fiddle,
and Mick Flynn from Dublin,
who plays a variety of instru-
ments including banjo, penny-
whistle and tabor.
Their performance was tho-
roughly enjoyed by the audience,
who joined in all the choruses
with gusto. Their repertoire
ranged from a traditional Irish
instrumental which began the
evening to " pop " music in the
form of the Dubliners' hit " A
Black Velvet Band." Their song?
were highly amusing and included
a delightful song about a girl frorp
Barnstable written by Jeremy
Tailor of " Wait a Minim' and
" Mrs. Wilson's Diary " fame.
The Tinkers were ably sup-
ported by members of I.C. folk
who demonstrated that there is a
great deal of talent in the folk
world right here in college.
Throughout the evening the tre-
mendous audience participation
was a clear reflection on the talent
of the performers.
