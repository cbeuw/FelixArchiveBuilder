Some might call him a zebra. To me he's Socrates. Matches the scarf, too. Difficult in the digs.
But not at Martins. They understand. They're so friendly at Martins—especially to students.
Martins have an especial knowledge of a student's need to budget grants and allowances carefully
which is why so many students find it worthwhile to open an account at Martins. Ask for a copy of
the leaflet 'About a Bank Account', specially written for students.
Martins go to extremes to be helpful
