1st Soccer XI Retain
Unbroken Record
A function of the sports page is to report on news, views and in
fact anything worth mentioning about sport in I.C. It is the respon-
sibility of the athletics clubs to submit news of their activities, what-
ever it might be. Everything, and in fact anything, , II be con-
sidered, and it is hoped that, eventually, all the sports clubs will be
represented in their respective proportion.
1st XV Crush Beckenham
I.C. Ist XV 29—BECKENHAM 1st XV 3
Saturday saw a marked improvement in the whole of the I.C.
1st XV. Despite rather damp conditions the team got quickly into
their stride at Beckenham. We were fortunate to get an early con-
verted try due to some slack tackling near the opposition scrum, and
were soon on the way to amassing a good score.
Beckenham resisted well but the sheer speed and determination of
the I.C. back row brought Clive Summerton his first try. This was
followed by a try by Beckenham, which we gave away due to some
poor defence. Wefinishedthe first half with an orthodox passing
movement to the left wing for Rog. Chappell to plough his way over.
After a lapse at the beginning of the second half, if we scored two
further good tries and John Lum boosted the score with some fine
place kicks. We left thefield,just as it started to rain, worthy winners
at 29-3.
The whole club had a block fixture with Beckenham with the
Ex-Ists, Bl's and B2's also winning, the other teams just losing.
It is verv pleasing to see a great deal of team spirit being gene-
rated in the lower teams and I am sure this will take us all to some
good victories.

Club
Expanding
The I.C. Squash Club is ex-
panding and becoming increas-
ingly active in anticipation of
having its own courts when the
Sports Centre is completed.
Last year ourfirstteam played
24 team matches and won 21.
This year we are playing in the
London University League and
have entered four competition
teams—one in Division I, one in
Division II and two in Division
III. One of the latter teams has
been allocated to girls at I.C.
wanting to play competition
squash.
Bad Start
Thefirstshave not started well
in the League, losing to University
College and to the College of
Estate Management,, but they
have won a practice match against
RAF - College, Cranwell. The
seconds have done better by de-
feating the Institute of Education
without losing a game, and then
the Institute of Cancer Research.
The other teams have not played
yet.

I.C. Ist team v Q.M.C.
This match was thefirstof the
new academic year and proved to
be far from encouraging for I.C.
Theoretically, I.C. should easily
have won this match in spite of
the fact that in the Q.M.C. team
was an ex-Great Britain inter-
national, but I.C.'s play was too
scrappy and although close the
match was eventually lost. The
only bright spot was "Shorty"
Randall's three goals which at
one stage seemed to be swinging
the match I.C.'s way, but shot-
shy forwards and slack defensive
marking took their toll.
This match is better forgotten
although potentially I.C. have a
team capable of sweeping the
board in the U.L.U. honours.
The final score for the record was
4—5.

I.C. 4 —U.C. 2
The 1st XI continued then-
successful early season, run, by
beating LJ.C. at Harlington last
Wednesday. It was a somewhat
scrappy game, both apparently
still trying to sort out tactics at
the start of the season.
The game started off with I.C.
doing all the attacking, but no
goals came. After a quarter of
an hour U.C. gradually came into
the game and eventually scored
after 25 minutes with a very well
taken goal from 20 yards to take
the lead. Shortly after a clever
run down to left wing Geoff Keer,
afirstyear who is giving tremen-
dous punch to I.e. created an
equaliser A hard low centre was
too much for the goalkeeper to
hold and Male Whittle hooked the
ball into the roof of the net. Just
on half time an almost identical
move by I.C. gave them the lead,
again a long run and hard ac-
curate centre by Keer, again the
goalkeeper failed to hold and
centre-forward Whittle made no
mistake in converting.
In the second half U.C. fought
very hard and for the first 20 min.
kept I.C. under constant pressure.
The I.C. defence however was too
strong for their forward line,
centre-half Brian Hall, another
exceptional 1st year, controlled the
middle both in the air and on the
ground with ease. But then in
keeping with I.C.'s infamous in-
consistency U.C. scored from a
corner with the I.C. defence com-
pletely at 6's and 7's.
After this I.C. appeared to
gather their senses and commen-
ced to take control of the game.
All eleven players combined very
well and numerous good moves
created, by law of averages per-
haps, two more goals. Stan Lister
put a hard low ball down the
middle which Phil Hopwood
cleverly stepped over sending the
defence the wrong way, and Geoff
Keer after a bit of scrambling
scored a very good goal. Shortly
after, Brian Hall split the defence
with a clever flick and Lister
made no mistake in scoring num-
ber four.
All in all, a satisfactory per-
formance by I.C. and let's hope
that early season spirits and suc-
cess will continue throughout the
year and that soccer cups will
come to I.C. this year.

ULU Honours
Imperial College gained nine
University team places after the
trial at Parliament Hill Fields last
Saturday. Barry Jones, a P.G.
fresher and New Zealand three
mile champion finished second
only ten yards behind the winner.
He was well backed up by the
rest of the I.C. team with Nick
Barton, Tony Mason, Ian Jones,
Howard Smith, Ashley Deans,
Dave Dallman, Alan Mowatt and
Norman Morrison gaining Uni-
versity team places.
I.C. are now lying second in
the London Colleges League I
and are going all out to win.
There should also be a good battle
in League II with the III and IV
teams keen to gain promotion. If
the fighting spirit of the team
maintains its present level, this
will be its best season for many
years.

5 Teams
Two trials were held this year,
and it was apparent from them
that the club would be able to
field some strong teams. This
has in fact turned out to be the
case and so far the 2nd, 3rd and
4th elevens have met with not a
little success.
Since there are nearly 80 mem-
bers in the Club it is hoped to run
a regular 5th XI, and fixtures are
now being arranged. Therefore
it is vitally important that mem-
bers co-operate with the commit-
tee by filling up the availability
list as far ahead as possible since
there is no point in arranging
fixtures for non-existent teams.
The First Eleven included 6
members from last year's eleven.
Although at the time of writing
the results consist of draws with
Guy's Hospital and Southampton
University, and a narrow defeat
by West Essex, it is felt that suc-
cess will come once the team has
settled down.
Finally, let us hope that the U.L.
Challenge Cup which so narrowly
eluded our grasp last year will in
fact come to I.C. this year.
