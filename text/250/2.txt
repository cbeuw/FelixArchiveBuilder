H.G.Wells Society
U.F.O.'s
The meeting opened approxi-
mately on time, and about 15
minutes later the committee, ac-
companied by the Guest speaker
Charles Bowen arrived, after be-
ing delayed by a very important
cup of coffee in Southside upper
lounge.
Mr. Bowen began his lecture by
saying that many people refused
to take the question of U.F.O's.
seriously, even though there had
been sightings for many years,
and a large amount of publicity
for the last 20 years.
Mr. Bowen is the editor of the
Hying Saucer Review, and in this
capacity has made a number of
appearances on television and
radio. Curiously enough he says
he does not believe in flying
saucers as such, but insists there
is a definite phenomenon to be
investigated.
In his discussions Mr. Bowen
told how in 1953 an American
Airforce Committee was set up
and systematically investigated
about 20 selected cases of sight-
ings. This Committee, however,
merely reported that nothing ex-
isted which presented itself as a
threat to the U.S.A. Before cir-
culation of this then secret docu-
ment the C.I.A. modified it to
say that any U.F.G. reports
should be played down as much
as possible, a thing which Mr.
Bowen believes is still happening.
He then went on to describe how
many, in his view, legitimate
sightings had been made out to
be sightings of planets or stars
distorted by atmospheric condi-
tions.
After describing, rather vividly,
a number of sightings reported to
him Mr. Bowen concluded by
saying how he dislikes people who
definitely go out of their way to
observe U.F.O's. and rates any
information put forward by them
as useless, but readily accepts

Ghosts
The Wells Soc. Ghosts Group
examined last year's trip to Han-
nath Hall on Tuesday 24 October.
Phil Haskell, the chief spirit,
started by giving an outline of the
legend concerning Hannath Hall,
one of the best-known haunted
houses in the country. Joseph
Hannath is supposed to have
bricked up his dead wife in a
chimney. Phil then described the
apparatus which they took with
them : tape-recorders, cameras,
pressure and heat detecting de-
vices. A great deal of time spent
travelling, setting up the apparatus
and two chilly nights waiting pro-
duced precisely nothing. Mr.
Haskell's view was that the psy-
chological attitude of the party
was too gay and cynical.
Psychological ?
Professor A. J. Ellison of
QMC, a member of the Society
for Psychic Research, agreed with
his view; in fact he stressed that
the psychological attitude of the
ghost watchers was of paramount
importance in creating ghosts. He
praised the technical ingenuity of
the group before warning of the
dangers of attributing noises hav-
ing rational explanations to hypo-
thetical ghosts.
IC 2000
The latest in the series of Wells
Soc. Study Group projects—the
" I.C. 2000 " Group—had its in-
troductory meeting on Tuesday
17th October.
The Group's aim is to identify
the choices and decisions open to
us which, if they are taken or just
left to drift, will determine what
an institution like this College will
be like in 2000 A.D.
For example, the new Univer-
sity of Sussex is a product tof
many radical ideas. To discuss
this topic, the Group invited
Professor David Daiches, one of
the thinkers behind the innova-
tions, to speak on " Universities
of the Future."
The main new idea in the crea-
tion of the University of Sussex
was the " core and context," ap-
proach; that is, to study a special-
ist subject plus its context among
related subjects. This was
achieved by creating schools
covering several subjects in place
of separate departments.
Other ideas have included
seminars bringing together stu-
dents of different subjects. There
is a systematic attempt at early
prevention of student breakdowns
and suicides. Students are advised
on how to study and organise
their time, in order to employ
their labours most productively.
Professor Daiches also drew from
his long experience in North
America to compare their systems
with ours.
The Group's next meetings are:
" Science as non-education, or
how to be a young fossil" on 14
November, and a talk by Profes-
sor Lord Ritchie-Calder on 21
November.

Hop
Punch-up
Following an argument over
the ownership of some bottles of
beer at the end of last Saturday's
hop, Rugby club member Rog
Marshall was attacked with a
bottle by two non-students.
Subsequently there was a chase
down Prince Consort Road in
which Rich Davies, Captain of
Soccer, caught one of the offen-
ders who was holding a large
iron bar. Returning to the se-
curity office the police were sum-
moned and the miscreant re-
moved (although he was later re-
leased as he could not be posi-
tively identified). IC Exec is to
hold a full inquiry into the affair
at their meeting on Monday.
IC Protests
I.C, participation in the anti-
Vietnam war rallies was, as might
be expected, strictly limited. Fol-
lowing Dave Flint's appeal at the
last Union meeting for as many
as possible to take part in the
rallies, an estimated fifteen I.C.
students went to Trafalgar Square
for the Sunday demonstration.
About half this group stayed for
the holocaust later outside the
American Embassy. As far as
can be gathered no I.C. man got
involved with the police-crowd
infighting, and the only incident
of note perpetrated by I.C. was a
severe reprimand to the Young
Liberals of I.C. from the Y L
London organizer for carrying the
wrong banners on the wrong day.
Exotic Jazz
on Sunday
Jazz and Folk returned with a
bang last Sunday following the
previous week's rather placid ses-
sion. The Splinter Group pro-
vided the Jazz complete with bow
tics and satin sashes and produced
a stirring effect in the subdued
blue light. Many strange sounds
from such exotic instruments as
the " swannee whistle " and the
" kazoo " were combined with
first class trad, and created con-
tinuous humour. The perform-
ance was indeed worthy of this
I.C. band which is recognised as
the top college traditional jazz
group.
Friday Trad
Friday October 20th saw the
first traditional jazz concert of the
year. Alan Elsdon's group per-
formed impeccably with near
brilliant solos by guest trombonist
Johnny Pickard and clarinet
player Andie Cooper. Mick
Gilligan on bass was most enter-
taining both to see and hear with
his unique way of making faces at
the double bass in time to the
music!
M 0 R P H Y S T O M P
In addition to the Sunday night
spots, there is a Morphy Day
Stomp in Southside featuring Blue
Nile and his Delta Jazzmen. On
Friday November 3rd the Ken
Gibson Big Band returns. This
fifteen piece jazz orchestra really
must be heard. Last at I.C. in
March, it made such a thrilling
sound that a return booking was
made at once.
Knobbly Knees contest at Sweatery Hour.
SWEAT
Last Thursday evening Tizard
Hall held a protest — another
protest! —• against the hothouse-
style central heating prevalent in
Southside. It took the form of
a Sweatery hour—a corruption
of the standard Tizard Buttery
hour^and wine was served in
place of the usual coffee. The
notable feature was that all the
protesters protested by wearing
towels, and little else. Those
who did not wear towels had to
pay extra for their wine—an anti-
democratic measure put forward
by new RCS President Bob
Mackman. There was a knobbly
knees contest, deservedly won by
craggy Geoff Longstaff, but this
did not detract from the main
purpose of the denudation, which
for some can only have been to
The subwarden was heard to
complain bitterly about the pro-
test. He claims that if the pro-
testors get their way, the tem-
perature of his flat will fall to
zero. A crowd of sympathetic
anti-protesters gathered, huddling
in thick winter overloats, but
soon after the meeting gaily ad-
journed to Southside bar.
Hell. Soc in
The Hellenic Society is now
recognised as an official IC club
following a brief grilling of
chairman George Assimakis at
the SCC meeting on the 18th
October. Deputy president
Martin Lack promises a society
notice board in Southside and
Assimakis envisages plenty of
social events in the future, pos-
sioly culminating in a trip to
Greece.
The same meeting discussed
SCC's contribution to carnival
and several of the clubs intend to
play their usual part in making it
a success. Chairman Pete Ruhe-
man said later that he hoped
an improved, invigorated and
more popular carnival fete would
result.
The Overseas students commit-
tee reported on the recepticyi
centre which was run at the be-
ginning of term for foreign
freshers. Their report stated that
it was clear that the main problem
they all faced was accommoda-
tion, and it was generally hoped
that the Union and the College
could start tackling this problem
before the beginning of next
session.
