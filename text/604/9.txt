M a j o r disaster! T h e bowling team lost for the
second week running, this time on the grotty
lanes of the Portsmouth Bowl.

M c M u l l a n , K e v i n Short and Paul Gear, who
first equalled and then improved on his high
score, b o w l e d w e l l a n d both ieams lost
heavily. T h e C team lost the firs! game by
over 100 pins but fought back to win the next
two games and so gain a draw overall Neil
G r i m w o o d once again improved his high
series. Once again, we failed to field a ladies
team but Alison and Julie did their jobs as
cheerleaders admirably.

Thirds
Contrary to expectations Belsize Park were
shit hot. But we were better. Yet again I C
had a far smaller pack, and would have to
rely upon the backs lor any attacking play.
T e n minutes into the game saw some slick
passing to the wing, and intelligent play put
Julian Norley away on the overlap for IC's
first try. I C kept up the pressure throughout
the first hall taking advantage of Belsize's
mistakes, which resulted in J o h n Wittrick
pouncing on a loose ball for our second try.
T h e second hall saw Belsize attack hard
denying I C possession of clean ball. After
conceding a try, spirited play took IC up the
field where Ian Magness forced his way over
for the t h i r d try. Belsize later scored a
breakaway try. At no time did the thirds look
in serious trouble having lull confidence i n
their own abilities, and ignoring the captain.
Still unbeaten this season.

Firsts
Kennedy and Butler; 4th, 5th, 3 capsizes,
broken kicking strap and rudder.
Mills and R e d m a n : 5th, 2nd, 4 capsizes,
broken seat and bent centreboard.
Bennett and Dalton, D N F , 4th, numerous
capsizes, one boat sunk!
W e lost 0-2, 20'/2 pts—27pts.
In a light force 7 the team generously
offered to test U E A ' s boats to destruction.
In the first race the team got off to a good
start but this could not last for long. Bennett
and Dalton were rammed on the first beat in
a vicious (illegal) manoeuvre by the opposi-
tion. This was followed by a dastardly move
(also illegal) against Mills and R e d m a n which
resulted in their subsequent capsize, they
then proceeded to dredge the channel for
twenty minutes. Kennedy a n d Butler, on
their way past, hysterical with laughter,
executed " a superb death r o l l " and joined
Mills and R e d m a n in their industrious work.
Not to be outdone Bennett and Dalton joined
in, performing numerous 'immersion tests' on
their boat, and sank!! This meant an easy
win for D E A , 103
/4 pts-16pts.
Alter a break to recover Bennett's boat,
ieffect repairs and eat lunch, the second race
iwas started with some trepidation. Mills and
Kennedy made good starts a n d the team
were placed 2, 3. 4 round the first mark. This
temporary situation was soon rectified when,
at the second mark, Kennedy demonstrated a
classic 'gybe a n d swim for it' manoeuvre.
This was copied beautifully by Bennett when
he arrived at the same mark a few minutes
later. O n the second lap Kennedy repeated
his d i s p l a y s i m u l t a n e o u s l y w i t h a U E A
boat—demonstrating that ballet on water is
possible! Miraculously Mills stayed the right
way up and the race finished with U E A i n
1st, 3 r d , 6 t h p o s i t i o n : 9 V 4 p t s vs l l p t s ;
2 capsizes vs 3 capsizes.

Seconds
Scene: A medieval jousting tournament, the
eleven champions from the realm of I C take
on the grovelling challengers from Raynes
Park. The two captains hold-court.
R P : Greetings sire, I fear I have to ask of
thee a favour—cans't we have one of your
men to make our feeble team up to full •
strength?
IC: You've got to be jesting mate—let battle
commence!
R P : O h t r a g e d y ! — o u r defence is split
asunder a n d the great W y l i e , k n i g h t o l
Northumbria hast perforated our backboard.
IC: T h y defence ist more decrepid than I C
1st XI—see Eric the R e d K n i g h t has scored
ye second goal—even if it was at ye fourth
attempt!
R P : W e shall take refreshment and extract
revenge.
IC: T h o u couldn'st extract juice from ye half-
t i m e oranges! See h o w the great W y l i e
springs ye offside trap and scores thrice more.
O u r cups will be o'erllowing with ale this
night.
R P : O u r midfield ist frustrated, look how our
left half seeks to plant one on thy right
winger.
I C : T r u e , ' t i s M a n g a t s h o w i n g fearful
displeasure, I must end this terrible carnage.
— Y e final whistle blows—
R P : T h y defense was too strong sire.
IC: Aye, if thou ventures into these parts
again we shall give thee another wigging.

Mixed
The usual Sunday morning enthusiasm for
hockey was immediately apparent during the
warm-up, but once the effects of Saturday
night had been run off, the team settled down
to play its usual attractive, crowd-pulling
hockey. Unfortunately, after about twenty
minutes the inevitable happened when T i m
Coatesworth, despite being relegated to a
defensive position, managed to poach yet
another goal from the forward line by scoring
from a shor corner.
Soon alter our persistence paid off and
history was made when a cross by A n d y
Stroomer was converted by Alison W a l l . This
was our first "non-Coatesworth" goal of the
seas,in. U C seemed confused by all of this and
for some obscure reason decided to attempt
the systematic removal of A n d y Stroomer's
fingers!
Despite the openness of our defence at
times, U C never managed to find that extra
bit of penetration with T i m , R u t h and Steve
coping admirably. Goalkeeper Chris Jones
m a n a g e d to t h r o w w h a t e v e r part o f his
anatomy was available at the time at the ball
and was only beaten late i n the game by a
well-taken 'volley'. Fine work down the left
by Chris, R u t h and Alison produced a set of
chances nearly converted by J o and K a r e n .
The unbeaten run continues a n d we look
forward to next week when a n attempt will
be made to keep Gray off the "teas"!
