Kinnock on Cuts
Neil K i n n o c k M l ' , the Shadow Education Secretary, attracted a
sizeable audience on Tuesday when he discussed the L a b o u r Party's
alternative lo education cuts. H i s speech firstly reviewed the current
situation, and then indicated Labour's plans.
T h e C u r r e n t Situation
M i K i i m o e k staled t h a t , i n h u m a n terms, t h e C o n s e r v a t i v e
government lias already excluded .many thousands of people from
highei education. This is compounded financially, in that redundancy
payments of stall will probably outweigh the savings achieved. T h e
result is that education cuts are "even more destructive than even the
government intended." T h e danger is that the cuts, aimed primarily at
arts courses, will undermine the structure of most universities. A
p r o b a b l e c o n s e q u e n c e , h e s a i d , w o u l d b e t h e c r e a t i o n o f
ovcrspeeialisod "monotechnics". Sir K e i t h Joseph would naturally like
to see such establishments full of students " w i t h short hair, shiny shoes
and living at home o n student loans".
T h e L a b o u r Alternative
M r K i n n o c k stated Labour's education policy to be expansion a n d
change. L a b o u r would restore higher education financially, but would
expect universities to argue their case more effectively. In .particular,
the animosity between colleges and the general public must be healed.
H e said that university admissions procedures need to be changed, so
that they a r e p r e o c c u p i e d w i t h a c c e p t i n g , a n d n o t r e j e c t i n g ,
prospective students. F o r this, more introductory courses a n d more
modular courses should be started. Moreover, a selection criterion
would be which candidates could best take advantage of higher
education.
O n overseas students, M r K i n n o c k rejected the current policy of
imposing full-cost fees. T h e L a b o u r Party resents what he termed the
government's "chauvinist prejudice", as it results i n the sole criterion
for selection being money. H e advocated that overseas students be
recommended for a place purely on ability. A proportion of overseas
development spending, funded by N o r t h Sea oil, would sponsor those
students who can't afford the lees.
After the meeting. L'nion President Nick M o r t o n talked to M r
K i n n o c k . T h e President will, if all goes well, arrange an appointment
to discuss IC.'s case with the Shadow Education Secretary.

Treasury a n d a member of the
C a b i n e t , s p o k e i n C o l l e g e
yesterday at the invitation of the
C o n s e r v a t i v e S o c i e t y . H e a d -
dressed a well attended meeting
on the subject of the Government's
economic policy.
H e outlined the background ol
uneompetitiveness against which
the present situation must be set.
T h e g o v e r n m e n t is, he s a i d ,
improving the situation by acting
to reduce inflation which has
halved since the government took
office. T h e rise in unemployment
is very u n f o r t u n a t e , b u t is a
consequence ol overmanning and
the only long-term solution is the
control o f inflation. Orders to
industry are already increasing,
as is productivity, and soon a fall
in unemployment will result, he
claimed.
H e predicted that by the time
of the next General Election the
government will be able to show
that inflation is under control,
that unemployment is falling,
a n d t h a t B r i t i s h i n d u s t r y ,
resorting to competitiveness, is
prospering again.
Public spending is being cut as
far as possible to r e d u c e t h e
burden of taxes and interest rates
on industry. However he thought
that much is being done, at great
expense, to mitigate the worst
effects o f u n e m p l o y m e n t , f o r
example the new Y o u t h T r a i n i n g
Scheme.
Afterwards M r Brittan answer-
ed several questions from the
audience about the government's
economic policy. H e is the second
