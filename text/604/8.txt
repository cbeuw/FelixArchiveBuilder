Wood's Golden Turkey
atlC
Imperial College Science Fiction Society is to
show the film Plan 9 from Outer Space on
Tuesday (6:30pm, Mech Eng 220), which has
been hailed as the bad film cult classic.
Plan 9 concerns the bid by alien beings to
prevent the destruction of the entire universe.
To do this they must stop the human race
from developing a bomb which would explode
the sun. When peaceful methods fail they
invoke Plan 9, whereby the human dead are
raised from the grave and set against their own
race.
The film has received many awards: The
Worst Film Ever Made at The Worst Film
Festival held in New York in November 1980,
and IVorsf Film in the book The Golden
Turkey Awards.
The plot is complemented by some highly
amusing acting and dialogue. Director Edward
D. Wood Jnr. shot about three minutes
footage of veteran actor (and friend) Bela
Lugosi stalking and around his home dressed
as Dracula. When Lugosi died, a "double" was
needed to complete the film, who was a good
foot taller and concealed his imposture with a
cloak draped over half of his face.
Some of the classic dialogue is typified by
the line "Inspector Clay is dead. Murdered.
And somebody is responsible!"
Entrance is 20p to members, 50p to non-
members.

T h e I C Fencing C l u b put u p four teams
against the Central L o n d o n Polytechnic i n
an away match o n J a n u a r y 26. T h e epee
team was the only victorious one, w i n n i n g by
five fights to four. Phil Bird and Steve T a y l o r
were r e s p o n s i b l e f o r t w o w i n s e a c h a n d
G r a h a m e Barfleet the fifth.
T h e first fight in both the Ladies Foil and
the sabre were won by I C , the opposition
then went o n to w i n the subsequent 8, while
the two fights in the mens foil team were won
by Peter Boines.
T h e results are s o m e w h a t m i s l e a d i n g ,
implying that C L P made light work of I C ,
and although this was the case in some of the
fights, several of them went to 4-all before
being lost.
A l l in a l l it was an enjoyable match and it
made a pleasant change to fence o n a floor
with a good grip as opposed to the skating
rink on the third floor of the U n i o n Building!
Football

F'irst half they had the wind.

P.S. 4-2.

A f t e r a short t o u r o f S i d c u p , I m p e r i a l
descended o n Middlesex for a second round
cup tussle. Both teams started well o n a
smooth pitch but after 1 ' / 4 hours the surface
cut u p l e a v i n g I m p e r i a l c o n t r o l l i n g the
midfield and Middlesex packing their defense
area. After a scoreless first half Imperial set
up several chances, but even a series of short
corners failed to produce a goal. T h e ball
eventually found its w a y to the stick o f
' e n t r e p r e n e u r ' m i d f i e l d c o n t r o l l e r G e o f f
Ayers who muffled up a shot leaving it to the
reliable Bell to casually slot home a reverse
stick winner.
M i d d l e s e x f o u g h t b a c k i n t h e f i n a l
minutes, but ended second in a close match,
the first they've lost this season.
Thanks to J o n for transport (nuff said!)
and T i m for umpiring.
T e a m : Slatter, Clarke, Riley, Parker, Ayres,
Rao, Bell, Garmes, Franklin, Bateson, Farmer.
Ladies
W e won last week. W e won again this week.
W e beat U C H 10-2 last week. W e beat St.
Georges 5-1 this week. K a r e n scored a goal.
So d i d J o . Alison got two. T h e i r goalie .
scored one for us as well. Everybody played
really well and Caroline was very pleased
with us. W e saw lots o f b i g aeroplanes.
Afterwards we had lemonade which was very
nice.
Guess what, M u m m y said she will buy me
Janet and J o h n Book 2 for winning. I hope
w i n again next week.

Solutions to this week's puzzle, together
with any comments or criticisms, should be
sent to me at the FELIX Office as usual. There
will be a prize of Â£5 (donated by Mend-a-Bike)
for the correct solution randomly selected at
1:00pm on Wednesday.
Last Week's Solution
Oi the forty-five people who discovered that
three long and shaggies together with two
short and sophisticated make up 150 grams,
Steve Westcough, Maths 1, was chosen as the
winner, and he can collect his cheque on
Monday afternoon.
Many of you thought that the last two
puzzles were too easy. Well, this week's is the
sort which some people will see immediately,
and others will find very hard; it's just a matter
of spotting the correct approach. Next week
I'll try for something really tough!
Next week's Ents film is McVicar starring
Roger Daltry and Adam Faith. It is the story
of the convicted criminal James McVicar,
formerly Britain's "Most Wanted M a n " .
