CLUBS AND SOCIETIES
HG. Wells Society
We have seen the size of the planet earth shrink at an incredible rate this
century. Until relatively recently few people ever left the security of their
own town or village and the thought of venturing overseas never entered
their heads. This was at a time when it would take months, even years of
uncomfortable travel to reach your destination.
It took manifest destiny, toil, sweat and great hardship for the
American people to traverse their continent in a century. W o w all it takes
is $140 and a Greyhound bus to take you to Los Angeles in a day or so.
This century has seen newer and faster forms of transportation. Roads
and motorways have meandered their way through most parts of the
western world, with their tributaries running past everyone's doorstep.
Airplanes particularly have seen the time for journeys that would have
taken months melt away to mere hours.
In an age when we can travel through the air faster than the speed of
sound, when we can get out of bed in London to make it in time for tea in
New Y o r k , what does the future of transportation hold for us?
If you want to find out, come along to this Monday's lecture by R . M .
Taylor entitled 'Where now and What next?'
Industrial
John de Lorean, not content with
dashing the hopes of the Irish,
gave Industrial Soc a smack in the
gob last Friday when Ian Ross was
called away (on Thursday) to talk
to him instead of us! But many
thanks to all those who did come
to C h e m Eng—to find only the
Committee Meeting and no Ian
Ross.
Our next event is the Thames
Barrier Trip, on Friday, February
11, in the afternoon. This mighty
edifice protects a large amount of
London from flooding, which we
are assured could happen at any
time that heavy rain and spring
(boing and Zebedee) tides coin-
cide.

ICYHA
SF Soc
After an extended break (due to
bad weather) we finally went on
our first trip of the new year last
weekend—a long awaited visit to
the Dorset coast. We also have
planned a full term's activities
given below:
Feb 12-14: Peak District
Feb 26-28: Brecon Beacons
March 5-7: A cycle tour staying
at Saffron Walden and Houghton
Mill (Cambridgeshire area).
March 12-14: Lake District
March 27-Apr 3: Glen Coe in
the heart of the Scottish High-
lands.
These trips will cost around £10
for a weekend and £35 for the
week at E a s t e r . If any of this
sounds interesting come along to
S o u t h s i d e U p p e r L o u n g e any
T h u r s d a y b e t w e e n 12:30 a n d
2:00pm, or see our noticeboard in
Southside.
Wing Chun
Disenchanted, bored, would you
like to get your back on the rest of
this rotten world?....But seriously,
Wing C h u n is a form of Chinese
K u n g F u whose roots c a n be
traced back to Shaolin China.
It is neither a hard or soft style
but encompasses both, being in its
nature a close contact fighting art
emphasising compactness, short
distance and power and economy
of movement.
At the last A C C Meeting the
club was ratified to become an IC
Union club and consequently we
hope to better equip the club with
protective equipment as we soon
hope to be entering into competi-
tions.
N e w m e m b e r s a r e a l w a y s
welcome, so if you're interested
and would like to know more, we
m e e t i n t h e U n i o n G y m o n
Wednesday afternoons and on
S a t u r d a y s from 9:30 to 12:30,
or contact Wing Lai, Physics 2 via
letter-racks.
Cypriot
Are you an Ed Emshwiller fan? I
am! That's why this Tuesday is my
date of the year because we are
showing (6:30pm, ME220, etc.)
Relativity, the all-time classic film,
of, er, um, well yes. It's hard to
describe, but if you want to see a
film containing pot-holing, dancing,
fencing, nudity, violence, random
numbers, the size and complexity
of reality, and the catchiest tune in
known space, all inside twenty
minutes, don't miss it.
Also in the programme, Plan 9
from Outer Space, the worst film
ever made. A l i e n s attempt to
prevent mankind from destroying
everything with a new form of
energy they are about to discover
by resurrecting bodies with their
a m a z i n g rays from their flying
saucer. It stars Bela Lugosi and
Criswell (who?) and must be seen
to be disbelieved. The last time I
saw it was at 3 o'clock in the
morning. It took me weeks to
recover.
We challenge you to see both
films in one programme, but be
warned, the result could be a
permanent personality change, so
try not to turn up under the
influence of anything or your
doobries could remain severely
boggled. Entrance 50p for brave
non-members, and 20p for already
s l i g h t l y d a m a g e d m e m b e r s .
Students arise, you have nothing
to lose but your brains. Until next
week (if I survive)—
Deedle deedle deedle deedle
dee.

Mr Ed
F o r t h o s e w h o m i s s e d o u r
'Kafenio': It was a disaster! The
coffee was bitter...the cakes were
too sweet...the sandwiches were
s t a l e . . . t h e b a c k g a m m o n w a s
b o r i n g . . . t h e n e w s p a p e r s were
old...the card games were unex-
c i t i n g . . . t h e c o n v e r s a t i o n was
lacking...and the room was cold.
But I still had fun...played games
and kept warm...with
Tofalos
For those who came on Friday:
look out for posters and notices
for the next Kafenio (please tell
committee if Friday is unsuitable).
Remember not to miss the Over-
seas Student Committee's lec-
tures...most are very relevant
for Cypriots.
Rail Soc
U n l i k e B r i t i s h Rail (all praise,
g r o v e l , g r o v e l , here is t h r e e
hundred million for modernisation)
Railsoc is at last running smoothly.
A S L E F , strikes a n d L T apart,
there is a lot on this term. See
Southside noticeboard. O u r live
steam loco is, I'm sad to report still
in bits (like the A P T ! ) and our
model railway (in gauge) is on
indefinite strike due to lack of
interest!
If you like trains, be they in
model form or real life, come to
o u r n e x t m e e t i n g , e v e r y o n e
welcome!

Debating Society
For those of you who have not yet woken up after your Christmas
holiday, the IC Debating Society held a debate on Capitalism in the
second week of term. For those of you who woke up long enough to drag
yourself to the debate, thank you for your support.
We are planning further debates this term, including, hopefully, a
Nuclear Weapons debate, and, possibly, a South Africa—Apartheid
debate. Almost certainly there will be a debate on the superiority of the
male sex (no contest really), which will be held in a place with ready
refreshments, and debated by members of the society.
Which brings me to the next, and most important point: membership.
At present we have only the five committee members: D e r m o t
McCauley, Maths 3; Chris Lee, Maths 3; Steve Turner, Physics 1; Steve
Parr, Physics 1; Steve Chamberlain, Physics 1.
As well as the superiority debate, I have a few other ideas, but these
can only be implemented if we have some membes. Cards are now
available, and the fee will be 50p (contact one of the above five).
Join the society now, and we can have plenty of serious, half-serious
and lunatic debates; delay too long, and the society will fold up as it has
done in the past; and this would be a sad end to a valiant effort to bring
informative entertainment to IC.
Steve Turner
Publicity Officer
PS: Sorry for the solemn report. Y o u will cheer me up no end if lots of
you join. After all, in the words of the immortal Sir Robert, this could turn
out to be "....a major contribution to lunchtime entertaiment".
