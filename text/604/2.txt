Sir
From your treatment of M r
Barney M c C a b e on the cover
of F E L I X 603 it is q u i t e
obvious that you regard the
wearing oi' ladies apparel by
men as a bit of a joke.
However, as the owner of
the dress which M r M c C a b e
was wearing I was somewhat
shocked to see your front
cover. T h e " b l u e c h i f f o n "
dress was, in fact, a treasured
item of clothing which went
missing from the Beit laundry
several weeks ago.
P r e s u m a b l y the D e p u t y
President is also in possession
of my black silk underwear
a n d s e a m e d s t o c k i n g s . I
would be grateful if he would
return them immediately.

Dear Sir
W i t h reference to N . L a m -
brou s Soapbox ( F E L I X 603)
in particular, and the attitude
of people in office of any kind
in general I would like to take
exception to the vastly over-
u s e d c o p - o u t of ' s t u d e n t
apathy'. During my time at
College, like N . Lambrou, I
too have formed opinions of
the student body. However,
although at this time last year
I too thought our students to
be an apathetic bunch, I have
since changed my mind.
It is very easy to fall into the
trap of thinking " I organised
this wonderful event for them,
but they were too apathetic to
turn up. It's not my fault." But
this is in my opinion totally the
wrong attitude. The reason
why people don't go to an
event is because they don't
t h i n k t h e y w i l l e n j o y it
enough, or because they have
not noticed that it is happen-
ing. The fault for this rests
solely w i t h the organisers.
You could organise a public
hanging of Tony Benn and
Margaret Thatcher in Beit
Q u a d , b u t i f y o u d o n ' t
p u b l i c i s e it w e l l , enthuse
about it to those around you,
and go out of your way to
encourage attendance, people
c o u l d well not notice the
event.
I was totally unaware of M r
' E . C . Anyaoku's lecture taking
place, who he is, or exactly
what he was talking about.
Due to the dreary and unin-
s p i r i n g n a t u r e of the last
week's S o a p b o x , I ' m s t i l l
unsure.
If people organising events
are not prepared to get off
their fat backsides and put
some life into their projects
why should anyone else? I am
quite willing to admit that
any lack of interest in my
events is totally my fault.
Why is no-one else honest
enough to do the same?

Dear Sir
Thank you for publishing
N . Lambrou's Soapbox article
last week! I found it very
convincing and revealing. In
my four months at Imperial,
I've r e a l i s e d how s i m p l e -
minded the average IC stu-
dent is In fact I wonder
how m a n y even r e a d the
Soapbox article, beyond the
first paragraph!
A r e the s c i e n t i f i c a n d
e n g i n e e r i n g courses so de-
m a n d i n g that there is not
time to question " i d e a l s " ,
"purposes", "ambition"? O r
is it that r e a l a l e , space-
invaders and heavy rock are
more important than knowing
about T h i r d W o r l d countries?
It w o u l d be interesting to
survey how many know what
happened in Cyprus in 1974?
H o w it h a p p e n e d ? W h o
suffered? A n d what is the
situation now? Hopefully the
new C y p r u s S o c i e t y , this
term, will organise events to
answer these questions but
will there be anv listeners?

Dear Sir
N . L a m b r o u ' s article in
Soapbox last week highlights
a c o n t i n u i n g headache for
c l u b s o r g a n i s i n g meetings
with outside speakers. O S C ' s
lecture on 'New Nations' was
competing for audiences with
three other meetings.
The problem is clubs have
no way of knowing what other
meetings have already been
arranged for a particular day
when i n v i t i n g speakers. A
simple solution, surely, would
be to keep a diary in the
Union Office in which clubs
could record details of meet-
ings that they had arranged.
This could then be consulted
by anyone who wanted to
know whether a particular
day would still be suitable for
inviting a speaker.

Dear Sir
It is with interest and great
dismay that I have read the
article of Frank James and the
letters of M r Lyall and M r
M e r c e r . I w o u l d l i k e to
apologise to Frank for the lack
of p r e c i s i o n of b o t h M r
Mercer and M r Lyall's views.
For the last two weeks I have
w r i t t e n a letter for each
F E L I X and yet not forwarded
them. Now, I cannot remain
silent.
T o say that I am a Christian
needs clarifying for both M r
Mercer and M r Lyall have
said that they are Christians. I
believe that every word from
Genesis to Revelation is Gods
inspired word. I believe in a
six day creation and have yet
to find one scientific fact
which can say to me "Look,
here is evidence that demands
evolution and forbids crea-
tion". I challenge anybody
who reads this letter. M a y I
point a few things out.
1. The order of creation is
not the order of evolution.
The sun was created after
planets to state on biblical
fact.
2. Genesis 1 and Genesis 2
do not contradict. In Genesis
1 G o d says " T h i s is the order I
created heaven and earth. In
chap 2 G o d reveals a little
more, some of the detail, of
how H e created the world.
(Be careful with the Hebrew
tenses.)
3. The word for 'day' in
Gen 1 can be translated age.
But Exodus 2 0 v 8 - l l points
out that the Creation was
accomplished in six twenty
lour days. M a y I finally leave
a word of advice to the critics
of Gen 1 and 2. If you don't
believe it don't try and mock
or refute i t ; y o u deceive
yourself. If you don't believe
it, leave it alone.
T o M r Mercer and M r
Lyall; if you don't believe the
first two chapters of Genesis as
G o d s i n s p i r e d w o r d , y o u
might as well throw the whole
book away as unreliable and
rely on evolution lor salva-
tion.

W e i n the I s l a m i c Soc
w o u l d like to c o r r e c t the
erroneous assumptions made
by Messrs James and Lyall in
their letters to you in last
week's F E L I X . These mis-
interpretations were made
b o t h w i t h r e g a r d to the
objectives and contents of our
article.
Firstly our article was not
in response to M r James'. O u r
intention was to try to show in
a necessarily generalized way,
that in submission to the W i l l
of God—-i.e. Islam—both faith
and reason are united.
Since the age of enlight-
enment in the West, when
everything began to be re-
d u c e d to m a n - m a d e laws
t h r o u g h scientific m e t h o d -
ology, faith in the unseen has
been socially debased. Socio-
l o g i s t s h a v e s h o w n t h a t
religion is at best illogical and
at worst a cruel contrick; "the
opium of the poor".
Although some, like M r
Lyall, can honestly say that
the advance of science has not
affected his belief in a Creator,
nevertheless it c a n n o t be
denied that generally, belief
i n a s u p r e m e b e i n g a n d
therefore worhsip of H i m has
been pushed away from the
centre of the stage in Western
society. Materialistic concerns
have become the objects of
reason, and the worship of
God has become less than a
secondary concern.

had merely printed all the
