verses of the Q u r a n where
G o d says " I created " to
show readers w h y we worship,
the i g n o r a n c e o f r e a d e r s
about Islam would have made
them say " O K , that's their
book, it's the one M o h a m m e d
g a v e t h e A r a b s — t h e y ' r e
entitled to what they believe
in—so what?" Instead there-
fore, we tried to show the
reasons for our belief in G o d ,
a n d w o r s h i p o f H i m — five
times a day; in a more general
way. Thus we showed both
reason; r e p r e s e n t e d i n t h e
c o r r a l l a r i e s b e t w e e n what
s c i e n t i f i c t h e o r y a n d t h e
Q u r a n (Gods last vevelation
to M a n ) says about creation
and faith in G o d are united in
the religion of Islam.
It is in this context, alone,
that we quoted the Q u r a n i c
passages concerning creation
and not as M r James mis-
c h e v i o u s l y a s s u m e d . W e
believe that from our common
ancestor A d a m through to the
last prophet, M o h a m m e d , the
message to mankind has been
the single one of the unity and
oneness of God. Each prophet
from A d a m through to A b r a -
h a m , L o t , J o s e p h , M o s e s ,
Jesus a n d Prophet M o h a m -
med came to teach his parti-
cular people how to worship
the O n e G o d — a l t h o u g h the
last prophet h a d a mission to
the whole of mankind. But
always, the prophets brought
the same universal message of
Islam; submission to the will
of one G o d alone. W e do no
therefore countenance asso-
ciation of any partners with
G o d — w h e t h e r a n c e s t o r s ,
idols, H o l y Ghosts or "sons
and daughters" of God.
Finally with regard to M r
Lyall's comments on D a r w i n -
ism, space is too short to
discuss this interesting topic
a d e q u a t e l y — p e r h a p s we
should hold a seminar? A l l I
will say here is that whilst as a
theory Darwinism is adequate
to explain some of the evolu-
tionary processes in the plant
and animal kingdom, it is
inapplicable to mankind. T h e
Omnipotent Creator, created
us from nothing and returns
us to nothingness—and on the
Day of Resurrection, each one
of us will be held account-
able for our sojourn on earth.
A n d some of us will produce
accounts which show that we
tried to follow a righteous
path of belief in G o d , worship
of H i m a n d r i g h t a c t i o n .
Others will show that they
didn't believe, didn't worship
G o d , and blindly chased after
the material things of this life!

Accommodation
for next year
The time has come to start thinking seriously
about whether you want to apply to live in
College accommodation next year and about
what type of accommodation you want to go
for.
Application forms will be available from
Student Services on Monday, February 15.
The closing date for applications is Friday,
March 12. On Friday, February 12, FELIX will
carry an illustrated supplement giving full
details of available accommodation and how
to apply for it.
While you are waiting for the FELIX
supplement, here are a few thoughts to keep
you going.
H a / / s and Houses
For the purpose of applications to Halls and
Houses, you will be considered either as a re-
applicant if you have lived in a Hall or House
before or a new applicant if you haven't.
People who have lived in Residence before
can only be considered as new-applicants if:
a) They lived in Residence as an under-
graduate and will be a postgraduate next
session.
b) They have only lived in Residence during
the second half session i.e. they moved in
after the beginning of the spring term.
Third Year New Applicants
It is anticipated that all third year new
applicants will be successful in obtaining
place in Residence, in single room accommo-
dation. This is by no means a guarantee since
we may have an unexpectedly high demand.
Nevertheless, there is a good chance that we
will be able to house everybody in this
category.
Second Year New Applicants
Because of the priority given to third years,
second year new applicants stand less of a
chance of getting in and, if they do, there is a
high probability that they will be offered
shared rooms.
Re-appllcants
These are selected by a sub-committee of
each Hall and House Committee whose
members have not applied for a further year
in Residence.
Postgraduates
Postgraduate re-applicants are treated in the
same way as other re-applicants. Applications
from postgraduate new applicants are
considered by the Postgraduate Admissions
Tutors in the Departments. The closing date
for these applications is Friday, July 16.
Head Tenancies and College Flats
Present Head Tenancies include:
Hamlet Gdns, Hammersmith: flats for 3, 4, 6, 7
and 8.
Cambridge Gdns, Notting Hill: a flat for 4 and
one for 6.
Lexham Gdns, Kensington: flats for 3, 4, 5, 6,
and 8, also double flatlets and single bedsits.
Earls Court Square, Earls Court: single and
double rooms.
Sinclair Gardnes, Shepherds Bush: flats for 5
and 8.
Gerrard Mansions, Soho: flats for 2.
The College flats which will be available are
two Southside penthouse flats and one mews
flat behind Southside—all flats suitable for 4
people.
You can make one application for Resi-
dence and one for the Head Tenancies and
flats, if the latter application is successful,
your application for Residence will be
withdrawn.
If you are applying for the Head Tenancies
and flats, then except in the case of single
rooms and bedsits, you will need to apply
with one or more others. You will only be
considered for accommodation suitable for
the size of group in which you apply.
I hope this has started you thinking about
next year. Look out for next week's FELIX and
the illustrated supplement (we should have
some extra copies of the supplement at
Student Services if you miss the FELIX). If
you have any queries in the meantime, don't
hesitate to contact us.
