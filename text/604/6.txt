If I may make a simple request, please do not bring food and drink
into the Bookshop. W e are forever finding the remains of dog
eared sandwiches, crisps, etc., and various drinks, left on our
bookshelves. They do not enhance the beauty of the books.

Anyone want to go to Oxford on
Wednesday?
I hope everyone realises by now
the conditions under which we are

house-to-house collection licences
t h e r e f o r e we are o n l y legally
permitted to go Rag Mag selling on
university campuses. This is the
r e a s o n that we cannot collect
locally and hence have to hire
coaches to get to other campuses.

The first two lectures in the series "Nuclear War in Europe" (organised
by the College E N D group and Humanities department) have seen both
Professor Neild and L o r d Carver condemn the danger and futility of
Defence and Foreign Policies centred around nuclear weapons. Without
condition both speakers supported C N D ' s premises and arguments for
nuclear disarmament. However, Lord Carver raised doubts about C N D ' s '
proposed process of disarmament. The lectures were both attended by
upwards of 200 people', a trend hopefully repeated with the third last
Tuesday. The last lecture of the series takes the form of a debate
between ProfessonMichael Pentz and Lord Chalfont. This promises to
be a heavyweight tussle between two accomplished speakers, and it is
important that both sides (especially C N D ' s ) are adequately represented
in the audience. Furthermore, please note that a veteran disarmer, Lord
Zuckerman, will present the sixth Jubilee Lecture entitled 'Nuclear
Illusion and Reality'. The Rector will chair the occasion which takes place
in the Great Hall on February 18 at 5:30pm.
So as a ttnal reminder:
Tuesday, February 9 at 1:00pm, Physics L T 1 , 'Nuclear Deterrence-
fact or fiction"—a debate between Professor M . Pentz and L o r d
Chalfont.
Thursday, February 18 at 5:30pm, Great Hall, 'Nuclear Illusion and
Reality'—sixth Jubilee Lecture presented by Lord Zuckerman.
