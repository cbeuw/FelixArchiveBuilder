Attention all Election Candidates
The papers for the sabbatical elections go up
.next Friday and soon we will be flooded with
publicity for I C U and C C U elections. After
giving the matter of elections some thought it
has become apparent to me that it is very
difficult to be both informative and completely
unbiased. After all, it is hard for the electorate
at Imperial C o l l e g e to make informed
decisions, when all they have to rely on is the
candidates' own publicity in the form of
posters, handouts, a FELIX manifesto, IC
Radio and STOIC's promos.
For this reason I have decided to run a
special series of Soapbox articles running up
to the elections. Starting next week I invite any
member of College to submit articles on why
they think they are the right candidate for a
post or alternatively why someone else isn't.
You could even say what qualities you would
expect from anybody standing for a particular
position.
If the articles are concise, informative and to
the point then I shall attempt to print as many
as possible. This unique service gives both
candidates and electorate the chance to say
exactly what they want about the elections.
The only limitations will be length, factual
accuracy and, of course, the laws of libel.
So to start the ball rolling.
M r Harold Christopher Webb
This week Chris Webb, former External
Affairs Officer, came into the office to ask me
about publicity charges. It is rumoured that Mr
Webb is proposing to stand for ICU President.
In my opinion (and remember that these are
purely my personal feelings), Chris Webb is
just about the worst person who could
possibly stand for this post. The past two years
have been typified by a middle of the road
"reasonable" I C U President. John Passmore
had the added quality of being completely lazy
and a bit of a drunk, whilst Nick Morton, who
is a terribly nice person, has probably not
achieved everything he wanted to merely
because he is too easy going to stand up to
College.
Chris Webb, on the other hand is so wet
that he resembles Bangladesh after the
ravages of the monsoon. He is an ardent Tory,'
but is so middle of the road that he makes the
SDP look like the Hitler Youth. If he is elected
as ICU President then I think it will be a dark
day for IC Union.
I can see him now, agreeing with the Rector
over a large glass of claret and selling the
students down the river. He is a born politician
and as such has ambition which greatly
outweighs his ability. Sincerity is a word which
would not pass my lips when describing him.
What we need is a President with firm
opinions who will represent the students
strongly to the College authorities. Chris
Webb is not such a person.
Valentine's Day
Next week there will be a special Valentines
section in the Small Ads column. Please collect
forms from the office and return by 5:30pm on
Tuesday if you want a short message included.
Publicity Offer
This time of year always becomes a bit of a
pain in the arse when the swarms of
prospective sabbaticals arrive at the office two
days before the elections wanting posters
printed. In a move to encourage would-be
sabbaticals to get publicity in early, I am
intending to have a special discount price for
any publicity handed (complete and ready for
printing) to me by 5:30pm on Tuesday.
This special offer is open to all candidates
and will allow those who have planned their
ideas well the chance to benefit just a little.
They could have a few extra posters and
handouts or even save some money!
M y very own radio show
I have accepted the invitation to appear on IC
Radio on Tuesday evening at about 8:00pm. I
will be interviewed live on air by ace presenter
Mo and will be asked about many aspects of
College life and, of course, FELIX.
So listen in on Tuesday if you want to learn
who James Deeny really is and where he buys
his coffee.

Those of you who remember Weatherspoon
may remember that near his cottage a long
straight path crosses a long straight river (not
at right angles) and that Weatherspoon's pig
lives on the land in the acute angle between the
two.
Last week Weatherspoon was able to buy a
piece of land on the other side of the path. It's
triangular in shape, with the path and the river
(forming an obtuse angle) as two of its sides,
and a long fence as the third side. But it's a
little large for Weatherspoon to cultivate on his
own, so he's planning to divide it into smaller
plots which he will share out among his friends.
Of course, it isn't that simple. Firstly,
Weatherspoon insists that each plot must be
triangular. And secondly, he objects to what
he calls 'long thin triangles'. He says they're
"all fence and no grass". So I've offered to
show him how to divide his field up into
triangular plots in such a way that no plot has
an angle greater than or equal to a right angle.
But I hope Weatherspoon realises he will be
sharing his land with at least—how many
others? Continued on page 8.
