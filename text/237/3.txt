The charity for this years' Carnival is the Muscular Dystrophy
Fund. It was chosen by a large majority at the first Union meeting
of the year held on November 3rd. The Concert Hall was packed at
the beginning and at least one hundred people bad to stand in die
aisles or doorways.
The meeting commenced, as usual,
with the reading of the minutes of the
last union meeting (May 2bth) and
after the usual unanimous " N o "
they were signed as accurate. Under
matters arising it was stated that the
"Degree without Debt" inquiry which
was begun last year was still proceed,
ing, and that the total amount handed
over to charity by the Carnival fund
last year was £1,001 4s. 7d.
T h e r e were three letters to be dealt
w i t h under correspondence. T h e first
was f r o r , J o h n H a n d s , President o f
U L U , requesting p e r m i s s i o n to a d -
dress tiie U n i o n ; the second f r o m t h e
Senate w a s the a n n u a l w a r n i n g t o

letter was f r o m Messrs. E b d o n a n d
F l i n t a n d expressed concern at the
C o u n c i l decision n o t to a l l o w dis-

T o n y D u k e stated, i n reply t o this,
that C o u n c i l were acting w i t h i n their
rights i n t a k i n g this decision b u t a

A DECISION to double the NUS
subscription fee for each student
is likely to cause furious debate at
this year's Margate Conference.
It was at Margate two years
ago that the fee was raised from
1/3 to 2/6. The latest proposal
represents a 300 per cent, rise in
two years.
A Birmingham N U S spokesman
said, " I don't think we will be get-
ting value for our money when the
fee goes up to 5s, particularly if they
don't divert money to regional head-
quarters."
T h e N U S electoral system is also
causing dissatisfaction. A report b y
the committee set up at the Easter
conference is to r e c o m m e n d n o change
f r o m the present system.
T h e recently-formed R a d i c a l Stu-
dent A l l i a n c e has p u b l i s h e d a m a n i -
festo w h i c h attacks the N U S leader-
ship as a " self-perpetuating c l i q u e . "
It also criticises student organisations
for their " lack o f h n i l i t a n c y a n d per-
spective." N U S President-elect G e o f -
frey M a r t i n — l i k e his predecessor
f r o m Belfast U n i v e r s i t y — s a i d at
Swansea recently that he w o u l d w e l -
c o m e m i l i t a n c y .
Several colleges have already threa-
tened to disaffiliate f r o m N U S . A t
B r a d f o r d a committee has been set u p
to consider f o r m i n g a breakaway
m o v e m e n t i n the N o r t h . A n d S o u t h -
a m p t o n intends to w i t h d r a w unless the
v o t i n g system is changed to a " m o r e
equitable m e t h o d " b y Easter 1967.
