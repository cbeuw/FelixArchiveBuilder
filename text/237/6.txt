The Metal Box Graduate Training Schema
equips you to do a sound job almost
anywhere, but It equips you to get to the
top of Metal Box.
You assume responsibilities Immediately
you complete the appropriate training.
And while your first appointment
may not be a very high one it will be
sufficiently important for somebody who
ts very senior to worry about how
well you are doing it.
Metal Box does not discourage inter-
department mobility. This means that it is
possible for you to start in production and
to go to research. Or start in research and
go over to the commercial side. In short you
get the opportunity to find your metier
by testing your ability against a diverse
variety of problems-practical and
theoretical, technical and administrative.
Metal Box don't believe in labelling people.
In their view a science degree no more
precludes sound commercial thinking,
than an arts degree means one cannot
comprehend technicalities.
With Metal Box you can work abroad
without joining the brain drain, and return
to the U.K. without feeling like an expatriate.

way that matters most.
It's the largest packaging organisation
outside the United States.

factory and commercial managers,
production engineers, research engineers
and market researchers.
A research and development team of over
800 continuously engaged in a wide variety
of projects involving food technology,
physics, chemistry and microbiology.
