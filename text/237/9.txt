S A T U R D A Y T H E 29th of October saw the first of the inter-
collegiaite winter competitions at Motspur Park. These are run on a
league basis, with each college competing against another (I.C.'s
opponents were Guy's Hospital), so placings in an event are unimpor-
tant, providing the opposition's representative is beaten. Of course
everyone attempts to do his best—the U.L. captain and his talent
scouts are always on the lookout for potential team members—
so individual results were good.
Only seven members of the club turned out, with but one fresher, o f the
many who joined on Fresher's day. Even allowing for those whose cross
country commitments had first priority, this was rather poor—though other
teams were correspondingly small. However, the team acquitted itself with
some promising results. Fresher Richard Beck—another addition to the small
but strong Mines team—came second in the 220 yds. race and later coasted to
a win in the 440 yds. in a time of 51.4 sees. T h e non-running U . L . quarter-
mile champion being visibly perturbed by this. I.C. won all three jumps
through Derek Wade in the long jump, a returned to form Chris Power in the
long jump, and Mike Evans in the high jump. M i k e , now incidentally
Northumberland and Durham champion, conquered the opposition i n his
dazzling purple U . L . vest and claimed victory with a jump of 5 ft. 10 i n . —
he looks a likely successor to Leon H a l l as U . L . champion.
Generally speaking the performance of the established " s t a r s " was?
creditable, but a better turnout of Freshers is required—throwers are in great
need. Excuses of unfitness are unacceptable as training sessions are arranged
each Sunday and Wednesday, at Hurlingham, and Friday lunchtimes in the
gym. The U . L . championships are in the first week of the summer term and
Sports D a y isn't long after, so winter training is an essential preparation for
these events.

FIRST ELEVEN TOP LEAGUE
I.C 1, Battersea 0
UNDER "NEAR-IDEAL playing conditions I.C. made heavy
weather of beating a quite useful Battersea team. The pattern of the
play soOn emerged with I.C. doing most of the attacking and the oppo-
sition relying on the quick breakaway—these being quite easily dealt
with by a strong I.C. defence. However, Battersea did break clear
once—only terrible finishing prevented them from scoring. After this
they created few chances, whilst I.C. were doing a lot better. Unfor-
tunately, attack after attack was wasted throufh poor finishing.
Midway through the second half it seemed that Battersea were quite
content to play for a draw. A t times they were reduced to panic measures
to keep the I . C . forwards at bay. Sometime they had to crack and, with
about twenty minutes to go, Eastell scored with a well placed shot which the
goalkeeper touched but couldn't stop. During the game I . C . played some
glorious football, but were let down by their finishing. By virtue of this win,
I.C. are now too of their league.

MORPHY
DAY
T H O U G H V A S T hordes par-
ticipate in the Morphy Day re-
joicings, few 1
actually pother
with the rowing events. As far
as prestige is concerned the races
are much more important than
the organised(?) warfare. This
situation is rather a sad reflection
on the prevailing state of affairs
at college. Nevertheless the races
DO take places.
T h e c o n d i t i o n s f o r this year's races
were g o o d , i f slightly c h i l l y — w i t h a
strong tide a n d a f o l l o w i n g w i n d .
T h e L o w r y crews raced first, p r o d u c -
ing a close race to the h a l f w a y m a r k ,
where M i n e s caught a crab, leaving
G u i l d s w i t h a t w o length lead. How-
ever, M i n e s managed to regain c o n -
tact w i t h R . C . S . W h e n the M o r p h y

a slight lead, b u t m o v e d out o f the
