T h e N . U . S . debate together with the " President by Popular Vote " move-
ment, are the two hardy annuals of Union Meetings. The fact that they are
both such frequently recurring themes and lead to more heated discussion
than most other topics, would lead one to expect a high standard of debate.
The debates are, in fact, usually very disappointing. Ample notice of such
..lotions is given by the proposers and the Union, but, apart from the
proposers themselves, nobody seems to bother to work out their own arguments,
either for or against, until the debate itself. A s a result, the last R.CJS.
debate on the N . U . S . was a shambles. N o more can be said about it, except
that Pete Finch was rather brighter than usual in adding the " provided finance
can be obtained " clause, knowing full well that this must come from Council,
which is not really likely to be swayed by the arguments put forward last
week. A similar situation arose at the I.C. U n i o n Meeting two weeks ago
when the motion to establish contact with North and South Vietnamese students
was debated. The motion was carried largely because the House was impressed
by Malcolm Duckett's obvious sincerity of purpose, and because all other
speeches from the floor were of an extremely low standard. Please, all you
budding orators, give the motion a little thought in future before jumping to
your feet and trying to impress the U n i o n . Remember, not many people
have impressed so far.
C o u n c i l l o r s A l l ?
The same accusations of lack of preparation may be levelled at several
members of Council, which also had its first meeting of the year two weeks ago.
For those who are not aware of the fact, and they seem to be legion, Council
is that august body of elders who are responsible for the management of
Union affairs, particularly finance. Dr. K e n Weale, the H o n . Senior Treasurer,
had as usual prepared detailed estimates of income and expenditure for this
year, and had also written two foolscap pages of explanation. These naa
been issued to Council members some days prior to the meeting, but it was
obvious from the discussion that followed that few had bothered to read
them—certainly not in detail, anyway. Pete Finch spent sometime questioning
various aspects of the estimates which he did not thoroughly u n d e r s t a n d -
perhaps because he hadn't bothered to read the brief—until the Duke lost his
temper and shut him up. But how many of those who sagely accepted the
estimates and tut. tutted at Finch had really studied them themselves? O n the
whole, though, the meeting was conducted well and showed a fairly responsible
attitude from those present. The President showed the same somewhat
nervous self-confidence that was evident at the Union General Meeting—a
change from Fletcher's assertive steam-rollering chair technique. One does at
least have the impression that others are helping to run the Union and formu-
late policy this year. Duke shows promise—when Frank Fuchs proposed
the installation of a Juke-Box in the Southside Bar and was about to expound
at great length on the economies and aesthetic charms of such a device, the
President accurately assessed the feeling of the meeting and ruled further
discussion unnecessary, to the relief of all but one.
Last year's Carnival was the centre of much controversy and unpleasant-
ness, and as a result could hardly be described as a great success. With the
revamped Carnival organisation, much of the work has been given to the
Constituent Colleges and a competent committee is running the show. We
should see a major improvement this year, but everyone in the Union should
be thinking about his contribution now, instead of waiting till next summer, if
Carnival is going to realise its full potential.

Democracy and all that
In the past t w o weeks we have seen two U n i o n meetings, each one has been
attended by some feelings of discontent amongst certain members of the
Unions concerned. A t the IC U u i o n meeting last Thursday there were (two)
motions proposed from the floor voicing discontent of the way it was planned
to run the choosing of the Carnival charity. There have been many protests
about the R C S U n i o n meeting at which the N U S motion was debated.
In answer to the question of c a l l i n g
another meeting to give sufficient t i m e
for discussion, U n i o n H o n o r a r y Secre-
tary B r e n d o i j P a r k e r r e p l i e d that this
w o u l d have been considered i f he h a d
been questioned sufficiently early,
the letter protesting against the de-
c i s i o n to a l l o w no discussion was not
written until the previous M o n d a y .
W h i l e I do not consider that this has
set a serious precedent i n v i e w of the
a b o v e statement, 1 feel that it s h o u l d
have occured to the executive that dis-
cussion w o u l d be demanded a n d p r e -
v i s i o n s h o u l d have been m a d e for this.
It is i m p o r t a n t that they s h o u l d giv«
the i m p r e s s i o n that the U n i o n can be
r u n d e m o c r a t i c a l l y even i f this is not
possible to the extent of a l l o w i n g u n -
c o n t r o l l e d discussion. W i t h a l i m i t e d

agenda the U n i o n meeting must be

be ascertained this was not the fault
of the P u b l i c i t y C o m m i t e e . W h a t -
ever the t r u t h , a large n u m b e i of R C S
students were not fully a w a r e that the

Constitutional ?
H o w e v e r the most debatable p o i n t
to c o m e out of this debate is the
question of a- constitutional change.
K e i t h C a v a n a g h a d m i t s that the set-

R C S U at N U S involves such a change,
but that the m o t i o n debated merely
causes such a change to be proposed.

As you can see from a letter printed
in this issue, there are moves afoot
in this democratic institution to sup-
press the publication of political
advertisements. The Secretary of the
F E L I X Board, who also received a
copy of this letter, considers that
" there is a strong feeling for the ex-
clusion of Advertisements of a Politi-
cal Nature from F E L I X , " although he
himself subscribed to the last one.
Presumably the basis of this " s t r o n g
feeling " is one letter signed by several
members, albeit prominent members,
of the Union. These advertisements
were not published without careful
consideration. I do not see why
F E L I X should not be a forum for
political debate any more than reli-
gous or recreational debate, provided
it remains independant and unbiased.
I consider that the two political ad-
vertisements so far published repre-
sent the feelings of a significant
number of people in the College.
Since F E L I X is expected to run almost
solely on advertising revenue I must
point out to these people that the
two advertisements they deplore have
paid for almost 24 per cent of the
pages so far published this term. In
view of the fact that S C R U T I N Y was
wound up only three weeks ago due
to a lock of advertising, it would seem
foolhardy to reject any opportunity to
increase our revenue, provided that it
is within the limits of the law and
good taste.
