That Vietnam advert. . .
Sir,
We wish it be known that the petition concerning Vietnam, published in
the last issue of Felix, expressed our personal feelings. The Petition Organiser
had no authority to insert our official titles and his action is deeply regretted.

Sir.
1 must request- that y o u carry o u t
y o u r duty o f e n s u r i n g that a l l that is
published b y y o u c o n f o r m s t o g o o d
taste a n d r e m a i n s i n the bounds o f
fact o r fair c o m m e n t .
I refer to the subtle, vicious a n d
unwarranted attack o n D r . W a l t e r
A d a m s , w h i c h appeared under t h e
f o r m e r l y respected a n d responsible
p s e u d o n y m o f " C o l c u t t . " C o l c u t t
calls D r . A d a m s " the very apotheosis
of a racialist " — t h o u g h a d m i t t i n g that
he is a true c h a m p i o n o f academic
freedom. I protest that D r . A d a m s
is n o racialist, a n d that h i s actions
through the w h o l e o f h i s p u b l i c l i f e
do not w a r r a n t the attachment t o h i m
of the description " the c u l m i n a t i o n
or highest development o f " a racialist
(apotheosis a c c o r d i n g t o Webster,
1961), and challenge C o l c u t t t o adduce
any evidence s u p p o r t i n g his c l a i m .
It is a thing o f great discredit t o
I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e that c o m m e n t o n the
affairs o f another college should be
so c a l u m n i o u s , particularly i n a sup-
posedly responsible p u b l i c a t i o n w h i c h
is distributed to most U n i v e r s i t i e s a n d
Colleges i n the U n i t e d K i n g d o m .
J o h n G r o u t
another view
Sir,
It i s unfortunate that C o l c u t t c o u l d
not display a more sober c o n t r o l of
his e m o t i o n a l dislike ( F e l i x , 2 N o v . )
of the " l o n g haired, weirdie trouble-
m a k e r s o f L S E U n i o n . " H e , l i k e m a n y
others w i t h paternalist attitudes t o -
wards student protest, fails t o recog-
nise the f u n d a m e n t a l point that i t is
quite n a t u r a l f o r the L S E students t o
feel concerned over the a p p o i n t m e n t
o f D r . A d a m s as their D i r e c t o r — par-
ticularly i n v i e w o f the allegations
made against h i m i n the t w o reports
in question. T h e resolution passed
at the L S E u n i o n is o n l y a n expres-
sion of this genuine concern and the
fact that 425 students supported the
resolution t o only 10 against shows
h o w w i d e l y this concern i s spread.
O n another point w e a r e t o l d that
because t h e U n i o n has n o part t o
play i n the appointment o f the D i r e c -
tor it s h o u l d keep its m o u t h shut. A p -
plying this to life at large it implies
that o n e w h o has n o power i n a d e -
cision m a k i n g should have n o right
to express a n o p i n i o n either. W e l l ,
w e l l !
F i n a l l y i t is true that D r . A d a m s
did a n a d m i r a b l e j o b as the secretary
to the A c a d e m i c Assistance C o u n c i l
to help academic victims o f N a z i
G e r m a n y i n the thirties but does thai
mean that a l l his subsequent actions
should be beyond question" After

Sir,
A s a result o f y o u r " Support R h o -
desia " advert, F e l i x w a s accused i n
a letter t o the E d i t o r entitled " T H A T
A D ! " o f being " an outlet t o racist
and near-facist p r o p a g a n d a . "
Y o u r o n l y reply t o this extravagant
d e n u n c i a t i o n , w a s the rather weak
statement that " T h e E d i t o r does not
necessarily agree w i t h the o p i n i o n s
expressed b y advertisers etc. etc. " a
fact w h i c h a n y o n e w i t h t h e slightest
knowledge o f j o u r n a l i s m s h o u l d have
k n o w n .
H o w e v e r , be that as i t m a y , I d i d
feel that the entire letter stank of the
very intolerance, w h i c h is t h e root
cause o f A f r i c a ' s troubles today; and
I w o u l d just l i k e , through the courtesy
of y o u r c o l u m n , t o point o u t to the
writer, A s h o k G u r u s w a m y , that there
are i n fact m a n y people in the C o l -
lege w h o sympathise and even, dare
I s a y i t " S u p p o r t R h o d e s i a " in her
present crisis, none o f w h o m t o m y
knowledge, wear jackboots.

Indifference?
S i r ,
Y o u r e d i t o r i a l i n the last issue o f
F e l i x regretted the smallness of the
n u m b e r o f students present at the
M e m o r i a l Service f o r the late Rector.
If this w a s due, as y o u i m p l y , to i n -
difference to the m e m o r y of this great
m a n , i t w o u l d indeed be deplorable. 1
think however that there was another
reason f o r m a n y people staying away.
In a n age when only a s m a l l p r o p o r -
tion o f college members w o u l d c l a i m
themselves as C h r i s t i a n s , it is surely
a n a c h r o n i s t i c f o r the College's public
act o f m o u r n i n g to take the f o r m o f a
service i n a C h r i s t i a n c h u r c h c o n -
ducted b y a C h r i s t i a n minister. T o
expect people w h o are n o t C h r i s t i a n s
to j o i n i n this is t o expect them to
p e r f o r m a dishonest act and to submit
themselves to considerable embarrass-
ment.
In case i t be thought that the
C h r i s t i a n s i n the College wanted this
service, m a y I express m y feeling,
w h i c h 1 k n o w is shared b y m a n y other
Christians, that this k i n d of establish-
ment r e l i g i o n is a thing of the past,
and i n a n y case never h a d m u c h t o
do w i t h the C h r i s t i a n faith. M a y I
also point o u t that the service w a s
was arranged by the C o l l e g e a u t h o r i -
ties independently o f the C h u r c h i n
the C o l l e g e a n d its appointed chap-
lains.
It w o u l d have been better b y far f o r
a purely secular act of remembrance
to have been held b y the College, i n
w h i c h C h r i s t i a n s a n d n o n - C h r i s t i a n s
c o u l d have h a p p i l y taken part. W e
Christians w o u l d then have been free
to offer thanks t o G o d f o r the life o f
the Rector, and to pray f o r h i m and
his w i d o w a n d f a m i l y , i n o u r o w n
churches and i n our o w n way.
D . G . F i n c h a m
E d : F o r a C h r i s t i a n m a n 1 c a n see
no alternative to a C h r i s t i a n service.
I cannot see that a non-secular m e -
m o r i a l service has any significance.
Political Advertising
Sir,
T h e advertisements o n R h o d e s i a a n d V i e t n a m p r o m p t us t o m a k e the
f o l l o w i n g comments.
If the E d i t o r o f F e l i x is a l l o w e d t o accept this type o f advertising, then
he is causing the College N e w s p a p e r t o become a p o l i t i c a l mouthpiece. I n o u r
o p i n i o n this is n o t the f u n c t i o n o f a C o l l e g e N e w s p a p e r .
A person o r group o f persons w i t h strongly o p p o s i n g views, w h o w i s h t o
express their p o l i t i c a l disagreement, are forced t o put a similar advirtisement,
citing their views, i n a subsequent issue. H e n c e this c a n only develop into
a rather b o r i n g s l a n g i n g m a t c h as f a r as t h e general readers a r e concerned,
since a l l the arguments p u t forth, stated o r i m p l i e d , w i l l undoubtedly b e
second-hand a n d w e l l - k n o w n to a m a j o r i t y o f the readers t h r o u g h the n a t i o n a l
press.
We h o p e this a d v e r t i s i n g practice w i l l cease.

Sir,
I t h i n k it is a great pity that I C U
is, as it seems to be, c o n t i n u a l l y pre-
vented f r o m j o i n i n g N U S b y internal
p o l i t i c a l r i v a l r y . I a p p l a u d the ef-
forts o f some members o f R C S U i n
their attempt t o join N U S . T h i s m o -
t i o n was w e l l amended b y S. E . Barnes
to ensure that R C S representatives o n
N U S w o u l d be democratically elected
from the U n i o n a n d n o t n o m i n a t e d
by the general committee. T h i s w i l l
i n v o l v e a change o f constitution w h i c h
I hope w i l l be brought t h r o u g h the
necessary machinery eventually enab-
l i n g R C S to take a full a n d active
part i n N U S f r o m 1967 onwards.
R. E . M a c k m a n
S i r ,
A l t h o u g h some people m a y consi-
der that M o r p h y D a y a n d the S m o k -
ing C o n c e r t are amongst the most i m -
portant aspects of U n i o n life, I a m of
the o p i n i o n that the executive of
R C S U s h o u l d k n o w better. T h e fact
that a m o t i o n as important as R C S U
joining N U S should only appear o n
the A g e n d a N o t i c e s a f e w days b e -
fore the meeting, whereas the above-
mentioned " sports " received large-
scale p u b l i c i t y f o r t w o o r three weeks,
appears to m e to be either a d e -
liberate attempt to " slip it t h r o u g h
q u i c k l y , " o r a n u n w a r r a n t e d m i s -
management of U n i o n affairs. I n
both instances, this is a deplorable
situation.
I feel certain that such a n i m p o r -
tant m o t i o n c o u l d have been debated
at a later U n i o n meeting, b y w h i c h
time comprehensive speeches, both f o r
a n d against the m o t i o n , c o u l d have
been prepared.

replies
Sir,
I w o u l d like to reply to the charges
made b y M r . L a c k i n his letter t o this
edition o f F E L I X .
T h e N . U . S . m o t i o n w a s handed to
M r . C a v a n a g h o n the evening o f
T h u r s d a y , 3 r d N o v e m b e r , a n d I d i d
not receive it until F r i d a y , 4th. It was
therefore not possible to post publicity
two or three weeks before the U n i o n
G e n e r a l M e e t i n g .
T h e m o t i o n being received, i t w a s
not possible w i t h i n the powers o f the
Officers o f the U n i o n to defer i t t o a
later U n i o n meeting.
I resent most deeply the libellous
attacks on the integrity a n d compet-
ence of the Officers o f the U n i o n , and
hope that i n the future M r . L a c k , a n d
others o f his i l k , will have the sense
and responsibility to check the facts
before levelling such serious allega-
tions.

Sir,
W i t h reference to the R C S U meet-
ing o f Tuesday 8 N o v e m b e r , w e w i s h
to c o m p l a i n about the manner i n
w h i c h the " L i m e r i c k C o m p e t i t i o n
was promoted. It is our o p i n i o n that,
a l t h o u g h the l i m e r i c k s recited w o u l d
have been i n order at the " S m o k i n g
C o n c e r t " they were unsuitable f o r
a general u n i o n meeting at w h i c h
many members o f I C W A were present.
If I C W A members are to be encour-
aged to take p a r f ) i n u n i o n activities
we feel that this sort of b e h a v i o u r
should cease.

Guys Again
S i r ,
In the last issue of F e l i x the editor
published a n apology to M r . J i m
M u r r a y f o r references made to h i m
in the previous editions. I n v i e w of
the fact that I wrote the o r i g i n a l re-
port o n the Freshers H o p it seems
strange, t o say the least, that I w a s
not consulted at all o n the p u b l i c a t i o n
of the apology. There was p r o b a b l y
n o b o d y m o r e surprised than myself
when J read i t i n F e l i x .
As the F e l i x e d i t o r i a l board do n o t
seem interested i n whether m y i n f o r -
m a t i o n is accurate o r not, I w i l l f o r
the benefit o f those who are interested
reveal where it came f r o m . A f t e r the
H o p I interviewed " Some Other
G u y s " and o n discovering that they
had no agent and had travelled d o w n
from Newcastle for the day I naturally
asked h o w they came t o be appearing
at I C . " M y brother w a s C h a i r m a n
of y o u r E n t e r t a i n m e n t s C o m m i t t e e
last year " was the answer I received
f r o m o n e o f the group. " J i m M u r -
r a y ? " I asked, " Y e s " he replied. I
also had the i n f o r m a t i o n confirmed b y
a m e m b e r o f Ents C o m m i t t e e , w h o
for obvious reasons wishes to remain
a n o n y m o u s .
In his apology the E d i t o r also said:
" It was also stated i n several places
that M r . M u r r a y h a d failed h i s final
exams." A n y o n e w h o care t o read
throughout the o r i g i n a l article w i l l
see that i n fact i t was stated nowhere
that M r . M u r r a y h a d f a i l e d h i s final
exams. T h e E d i t o r , i n spite o f h i s
obvious anxiety to apologise f o r some-
thing, might at least have read the
article f o r w h i c h he was apologising.
In view of these facts the o n l y c o n -
clusion seems to be that o u r " c o n t r o -
versial a n d independent f o r t n i g h t l y
newspaper " has allowed itself to be
bullied into a retraction o f the f a c t s —
a very lamentable occurrence.
D . P. Sullivan
E d : I a m pleased that M r . S u l l i v an
has been w i l l i n g to restate his i n f o r -
m a t i o n personally. T h e article i n the
last isue stated that M r . M u r r a y em-,
phatically denied the facts represented
here. If M r . S u l l i v a n w i l l read the
whole of the first t w o issues he w i l l
find, jjn several places other than i n
his o w n article, that it w a s stated
that M r . M u r r a y had failed his e x a m i -
nations.
