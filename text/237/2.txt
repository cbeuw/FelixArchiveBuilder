F o l k C l u b - T h e YoungTradition
We usually dread going to College
Folk Clubs, but we have enjoyed
playing here and think that you are
easily the best college Folk Club we
have visited, the overall standard of
your singers being very g o o d . "
Thus said one member of the F o l k
group known as The Young Tradition,
IC's Folk Club's guests for the
evening. The group consisted of two
men and a girl who sang traditional
British songs in a style similar to that
of the Watersons, who were so popu-
lar last year when they appeared at
IC F o l k Club.
T h e W h i t e C i t y R a m b l e r s played
some r o u s i n g numbers to begin a n
; v e n i n g that was to consist almost en-
tirely of B r i t i s h folk music. T h e y were
f o l l o w e d by t w o members of the
group p l a y i n g solo, n a m e l y Ivor
G r a y s o n - S m i t h and then M e u r i g W i l -

W a l e s still has its o w n language.
A f t e r M e u r i g came another w e l l -
k n o w n resident, Steve G r a n t w i t h two
of his o w n c o m p o s i t i o n s as w e l l as

A f t e r one or two more songs f r o m
some of the other residents the a u d i -
ence was introduced^ to the evening's
guests T h e Y o u n g T r a d i t i o n . F r o m
then u n t i l the interval there was some
excellent singing i n h a r m o n y of m a n y
t r a d i t i o n a l songs and also a single
whistle. Included a m o n g the songs
was a selection of sea shanties giving
the audience a g o o d chance to display
their v o c a l talents.

With the National membership of
the Union of Liberal Students increas-
ing by 50 per cent this year, M a l c o l m
MacCullum feels it is moving into a
good period. In many cases the mem-
bership is up by 100 per cent as at
I.C.
M r . M a c C a l l u m believes that they
s h o u l d use the present g o o d c l i m a t e
w i t h i n the organisation, co-ordinate
the v a r i o u s sections a n d try to achieve
co-operation. T h e i r co-ordinated
efforts c o u l d then be directed outside
the party, p a r t i c u l a r l y to r u n n i n g their
campaigns effectively. A t the m o m e n t
the increased m e m b e r s h i p h a d caused
a n increased a m o u n t of w o r k i n the
central office at L i b e r a l P a r t y h e a d ,
quarters. T h e office was e x p a n d i n g
but depended at the m o m e n t o n v o l -
u n t a r y staff ; m o r e permanent staff
w i l l be f o r t h c o m i n g since the greater

If, as it appears, the m o t i o n involves
a change i n the constitution, it cannot
be regarded as passed, since any such
change must be posted four days be-
fore a vote is taken-7-the amendments
w h i c h involve the constitutional
changes were not included i n the
notice given. T h e changes are re-
quired to be passed at two further
meetings separated by at least a m o n t h .
Otherwise the m o t i o n c o u l d be split
into two halves, the h a l f e m b o d y i n g

the other h a l f r e q u i r i n g rather m o r e
technical treatment. It seems o d d
however, that such an i m p o r t a n t issue
merits less consideration than the
machinery to implement it.

new records available for loan to any
member of the College. A l l the
records, so far, are monphonic and
of classical music, but it is hoped in
future to buy records of both jazz

stereo records. The new library has
been made possible by a generous
grant from the Governing Body for
equipment and records, and by their
agreeing to the employment of a full-
t i m e music librarian.

a n y c o m m e n t o n the position of stu-
dents whose luggage was rifled i n

was still sub judice. H e d i d however
point out that no liability was ac-
