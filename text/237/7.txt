" T h e disease is one of the most in-
teresting, a n d at the same time one
of the most sad of all those with
which we have to deal : interesting
on account of its peculiar features
and mysterious nature, sad on ac-
count of our powerlessness to infl-
uence its course.
It is a disease of early life and of
early growth. Manifesting itself
commonly at the transition from in-
fancy to childhood, it develops with
the child's development, grows with
his growth—so that every increase in
stature is an increase in weakness and
each year takes him a step further on
the road to a helpless infirmity, and in
most cases to an early and inevitable
death."

a n d u n t i l recently the p o s i t i o n h a d
not changed. H o w e v e r , i n the past
six years, the M u s c u l a r D y s t r o p h y
group of G r e a t B r i t a i n has sup-
ported research to the tune of a quar-
ter of a m i l l i o n pounds. A s a result,
doctors can n o w detect the carrier i n
w o m e n to a n accuracy of 75 per cent,
a n d further research s h o u l d increase
this figure to over 90 per cent. A

IC against L S E
T h e L S E pair finished also i n three
N o - t r u m p s but this time E a s t was de-
clarer after b i d d i n g 2 N o - t r u m p s i n
response to West's o p e n i n g b i d of 2
diamonds. It shows r e m a r k a b l e re-
straint o n the part of both Wests i n
that the final contract stopped at
3 N o - t r u m p s .
M a k i n g this contract presents n o
difficulties. H o w e v e r the I C declarer
made 10 tricks (2 i n each of clubs,
d i a m o n d s a n d hearts, a n d 4 i n spades)
by tackling the spade-suit whereas o u r
opponents o n l y m a d e 9 tricks b y
going f o r the longer odds of estab-
l i s h i n g the d i a m o n d s .
H o w e v e r , on West's cards, i f he gets
a positive reply f r o m his partner he
must start t h i n k i n g about the possi-
bility of b i d d i n g a s l a m .
T h e first difficulty w h i c h confronts
West is deciding w h a t to open. T h e
choice lies between 2 D i a m o n d s
(showing eight p l a y i n g tricks with
d i a m o n d s as trumps) or two N o -
trumps (20-22 high c a r d points and a
reasonably even distribution). I w o u l d
f a v o u r a 2 N o - t r u m p o p e n i n g on the
h a n d since it holds the controls i n a l l
f o u r suits a n d the likely b i d d i n g se-
quence w o u l d then be :

East's b i d of 3 C l u b s is a s k i n g his
partner to b i d his four card suits in
ascending order.
O v e r 5 Spades East may well bid 6
Spades. A l t h o u g h t h i s is not a good
contract it is one w h i c h can be made
g o o d by good declarer play.
T h e probable lead from South will
be a small club, taken by the ace in
d u m m y , since S o u t h will not have
underled the k i n g of clubs against a
slam contract. D e c l a r e r now has a
certain club loser ,and the only ways
in w h i c h he can a v o i d losing a spade
trick are if W e s t holds K x spades or
if East h o l d 10, 8 doubleton. So
declarer w i l l play J hearts and over-
take w i t h K , n o w finesse J diamonds
and overtake with Q i n d u m m y if
East does not cover w i t h K . T r u m p a
small d i a m o n d i n h a n d a n d then
finesse J spades. W h e n N o r t h plays
6 spades it shows he c o u l d not have
started w i t h 10, 8 doubleton. So
S A F E T Y
Recently M r . Harry Fairbrother,
Secretary of the College branch of
A . S c . W . , told Felix that if the CoUege
were an industrial organisation with
the same number of people, the medi-
cal side would be far larger. The
conditions of use of machinery would
be far more strict. He also claimed
that there is insufficient access to the
College Health Centre and that there
are not enough first aid cabinents pro-
vided.
M r . F a i r b r o t h e r said that he
thought there s h o u l d be a student
representative o n the C o l l e g e Safety
C o m m i t t e e . T h e T e c h n i c a l Saff have
an elected representative—the c h a i r -
m a n of the C o l l e g e branch of the
A . S c . W . W h y s h o u l d there not be a
student rep.? M r . F a i r b r o t h e r seemed
to think that there s h o u l d be a repre-
sentation o f every g r o u p in the C o l -
lege, so that there s h o u l d be n o one
w h o d i d not have a say i n the r u n n i n g
of such a n i m p o r t a n t b o d y as the
Safety C o m m i t t e e .
D r . E . C o h e n , the c h a i r m a n of the
committee, said that he d i d not w a n t
the committee to be t u r n e d into a de-
bating society to meet every six
m o n t h s to decide whether or not to
grant some g r o u p or other a n extra
r a t i o n of safety. T h e f u n c t i o n of the
committee, he said, is to investigate
hazards a n d reduce accidents.
Remar k a b l e
R e c o r d
D r . C o h e n had a list of every acci-
dent i n v o l v i n g i n j u r y reported i n the
p e r i o d A p r i l to September this year.
T h i s list contained about a h u n d r e d
accidents, a l l of the order of bruises,
sprains . b r o k e n fingers w i t h a n occa-
sional b r o k e n a r m . O f the accidents
reported, o n l y about one or two
affected a student ,and a similar n u m -
ber affected the A c a d e m i c Staff. This
is r e m a r k a b l e , even though the
p e r i o d includes the l o n g v a c a t i o n ,
a n d c o u l d be e x p l a i n e d either b y the
fa<$t that the academic staff a n d stu-
dents are far less accident prone, or
that staff or students don't w a n t to
report their accidents. T h e T e c h n i c a l
a n d C l e a n i n g Staff w o u l d be m o r e i n -
c l i n e d to report accidents, as they then
get sick benefit. D r . C o h e n said that
despite the f a i r l y s m a l l n u m b e r of re-
ported accidents, the first a i d boxes
e m p t y at a p h e n o m e n a l rate.
B o t h M r . F a i r b r o t h e r a n d D r .
C o h e n were of the o p i n i o n that safety
is an attitude of m i n d . T h e attitude
of the C o l l e g e is illustrated by the
attendance at the safety lecture the
previous week. T h i s was publicised i n
F E L I X b e f o r e h a n d a n d it was stated
that a l l staff, academic and technical,
and a l l students w o u l d be welcome.
I n c l u d i n g the speaker, D r , B u z z a r d ,
D r . C o h e n , w h o i n t r o d u c e d h i m , and
two F E L I X reporters, the attend-
ance of the lecture was fifty-three m e n
a n d one w o m a n . T h i s out of a c o l -
lege of over 3,500 students alone.

opposition's cards such that the c o n -
tract c o u l d be made and then p l a y the
hand assuming that these are the
cards the opposition h o l d . It is sur-
prising h o w often b o l d p l a y like this
