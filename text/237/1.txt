At the last R.C.S.U. general meeting on Tuesday, 7th November,
the following motion was passed:
" The Royal College of Science Union instructs its General Com-
mittee to apply immediately for full membership of the National
Union of Students of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, if the
extra money can be made available and that a General Meeting
should elect an NUS Committee comprising of:
i. An NUS Secreary who shall become an officer of the Union,
a member of the General Committee, and Chairman of the NUS
Committee, the Secretary to be elected from and by a General Meeting
of the Union,
ii. Ex-officio the President of the Union,
Hi. Five members elected from and by a General Meeting of
the Union, the function of the Committee being to advise the General
Committee on matters concerning NUS and to be responsible for
NUS services. The Committee shall elect delegates and observers on
behalf of RCSU to any NUS conerence or committee on which RCSU
wishes to be represented."
It seems doubtful whether this was constitutional. Its effect will
be to create a new officer, a new general committee member, and a
new committee, which require amendments to the constitution—
a similar situation occurred in May when Brian Compton's publicity
committee had to be incorporated in the constitution, and am amend-
ment therefore had to be passed.
H i e original motion.
" T h e Royal College of Science instructs its General Committee to apply
immediately for full membership of the National Union of Students of England,
Wales and Northern Ireland."
might not have created these difficulties since the general committee has
"the power to a p p o i n t representatives to any committee on which it is desirable
to have the U n i o n represented" ( R J G S . U . constitution, article 67). However,
it was argued by Br. Barnes that a committee would be necessary to handle
N.UJS. services, and would ensure that the representatives were democratically
elected.
Before M r . Barnes' a m e n d m e n t to the motion- was voted on, President
C a v a n a g h said that there h a d never b e e n any intention1
of not d e m o c r a t i c -
ally electing the delegates. T h e a m e n d m e n t was, however, passed.
T h e m a i n debate was opened by M r .
B o o t h m a n who tabled the m o t i o n ; the
case for j o i n i n g N . U . S . was e l u c i -
dated by F . F u c h s , R . E . M a c k m a n ,
M i s s B . Hedge, and A . Lafferty, a n d
M r . B o o t h m a n s u m m e d up. T h e
argument was that R . C . S . U . w o u l d
not lose its a u t o n o m y , since N . U . S . is
a federation of colleges, i n d i v i d u a l
colleges being free to pursue their
o w n policies. M r . Lafferty said that
the U n i o n w o u l d not lose financially
since the C o u n t y C o u n c i l s were
legally compelled to pay the increase
in the U n i o n fees. T h i s assurance d i d
not prevent a n amendment, proposed
by M r . F i n c h , being passed, that the
U n i o n w o u l d not j o i n unless an a d d i -
tional grant s o u l d be obtained. M i s s
H e d g e pointed out that a l t h o u g h the
cost of j o i n i n g was 2/6 per head
(rising to 5/-), the cost for i n d i v i d u a l s
j o i n i n g was 17/6 (rising to 2 gns.) a n d
this made it cheaper to j o i n as a
whole, even if o n l y 16 per cent of
U n i o n members wished to j o i n p r i -
vately.
T h e opnc.stti opened w i t h a letter
written by R . C . L e t h b r i d g e , w h o c o u l d
not attend, and read by T i m D o e :
" I believe m a n y other members o f
R . C . S . U . w i l l be left w i t h no alterna-
tive but to resign f r o m R . C . S . U . if
this m o t i o n is c a r r i e d . . . I w o u l d
like to c o n v e y m y regret that this
u n i o n should lower itself even further
by considering a n y association w i t h a
c o s m o p o l i t a n body such as N . U . S . A
body that speaks w i t h o u t saying a n y -
t h i n g . "
M r . D o e continued by saying that
R . C . S . U . w o u l d gain n o t h i n g by
j o i n i n g N . U . S . a n d w o u l d lose m u c h
of its a u t o n o m y . M o s t of the c o n -
cessions w h i c h were available c o u l d
be obtained f r o m other sources or
s i m p l y w i t h an I C U card. R e g a r d i n g
the finance, M r . T a i t said that it was
not right that other people should
pay for N . U . S . concessions, through
increased R . C . S . U . fees.
M r . F u c h s summed up the case for
m o t i o n i n his usual l u c i d style
giving further details of N . U . S .
services.

B O A N E R G E S , Guild's veteran car mascot, successfully completed this year's
Brighton R u n , which was held on Sunday the 6th, the Seventieth Anniversary
of the repeal of the Red Flag Act. T h i s year's time was just under three
hours, undoubtedly a tribute on Bo's part to the t r a d i t i o n a l l y p y j a m a - c l a d

T h e time is very nearly a record for the car, n o w s i x t y - f o u r years o l d a n d a

C h e m i s t r y L e c t u r e T h e a t r e A was
again crowded for the important
N U S debate. A f t e r the minutes had
been read a n d signed as correct, Presi-
dent C a v a n a g h proceeded to attack
certain articles w h i c h h a d appeared in
F E L I X .
H e c l a i m e d that sufficient notice
h a d been a l l o w e d for the Rent T r i -
b u n a l M o t i o n , a n d that any criticism
should have been made d u r i n g the
debate a n d not in the letter page of
F E L I X . H e also objected to an article
by T i m D o e s in " L a t e N e w s . " w h i c h
had described the election of Q u e e n
of Jez as " a p r i m i t i v e a n d barbaric
spectacle." T h i s was a t r a d i t i o n a l
event, he said, and he was unable to
alter it. " H a d M r . D o e made his
criticisms at the time, the matter
c o u l d have been discussed."
T h e m a i n N U S debate f o l l o w e d ,
and the amended m o t i o n was carried
by 170 votes to 119. L a t e r F r a n k
F u c h s proposed that R C S U s h o u l d
encourage closer relations with R o y a l
College of A r t U n i o n , and that dis-
cussions should be started about re-
ciprocal agreements. T h i s motion was
carried o v e r w h e l m i n g l y — o n l y half a
dozen A C W a r i a n s voted against. A s
an interim agreement. R C S U m e m -
bers were to be a l l o w e d into R C A

If a n a p p l i c a t i o n were made to

it w o u l d be notified at the c o m i n g
M a r g a t e Conference a n d the college
w o u l d be able to send delegates. T h i s
was the reply given by R o g e r L y o n s
(treasurer of N U S ) to a question put
by F r a n k F u c h s . M r . F u c h s asked

introduction, questions were put to
M r . L y o n s .
T o a question about p o l i t i c a l influ-
ence in N U S he said it was not pos-
sible for a n N U S conference to dis-
cuss p o l i t i c a l motions due to its c o n -
stitution. H e admitted, however, that
political groups did exist behind the
scenes.
O n N U S fees M r . L y o n s said that
the fee was due to increase shortly to
5s. 0d., however for colleges w i t h fi-
nancial difficulties special concessions
w o u l d be made. S. Barnes
