Sunday Night Sessions
I t has been decided a t a j o i n t meeting of the F o l k Club, Jazz Club,
Chairman of Encs. and Deputy President t o discontinue the i n f o r m a l Sunday night
* c o o l spots'c
The d e c i s i o n was taken because of the decreasing i n t e r e s t shown by the
audience, as appiurent by the i n c r e a s i n g noise l e v e l e s p e c i a l l y i n the bar area.
The Sunday sessions were s t a r t e d l a s t year as an attempt t o f i l l i n empty
Sunday n i g h t s i n College, and were meant t o have a r e l a x e d inforraal atmosphere,
hoping to a t t r a c t students and t h e i r g i r l ~ f r i e n d s . As such the f i r s t two of
t h i s term were successes. The r e l a x e d atmosphere was prevalent and the audience
was prepared t o l i s t e n . This l a s t p o i n t i s important t o the P o l k Club as they
are not background music. I n l a t e r weeks the attendance by the P o l k Club f e l l o f f
because they c o u l d not get the a t t e n t i o n from the audience that they merited.
The l a s t two weeks have made i t c l e a r that the sessions could not go on i n
t h e i r present form, because o f the well-known group that began forming around the
Bar, and who seemed t o show l i t t l e i n t e r e s t i n the proceedings, except when they
could comment on some p a r t i c u l a r person's performance.
I t was not intended t o ponder t o t h e i r tastes which became apparent on
Sunday w i t h a rendering of a well-known Rugby-song by a life-member of the Union
a f t e r the evening c l o s e d , so i t has been decided, vath r e g r e t , t o c l o s e the
sessions f o r the r e s t of t h i s term,

A l a n Richardson, the Chairman of the N a t i o n a l A s s o c i a t i o n of Labour
Students' Organisations, spoke »o the S o c i a l i s t Society on November 12f about
the Student L e f t . lie d i s c u s s e d f i r s t the r o l e of the S o c i a l i s t S o c i e t y i n s i d e
a U n i v e r s i t y , a r o l e which he described as being not only concerned w i t h
n a t i o n a l i s s u e s but a l s o w i t h the more mundane sides of student l i f e , i n c l u d i n g
such t h i n g s as s t a f f - s t u d e n t r e l a t i o n s h i p s , student freedom, c u r r i c u l a and the
l i k e . Pie continued w i t h some remarks on the R a d i c a l Student A l l i a n c e of which he
i s one of the founder members together w i t h other l i b e r a l - m i n d e d thinkers. The
aim of the RSA he s a i d was t o push the NUS executive i n t o implementing the
decisions made a t c o u n c i l . This aim might not be immediately r e l e v a n t t o a l l I.C.
students but i t i s bound t o a f f e c t them, be I.C. i n the NUS o r not.
