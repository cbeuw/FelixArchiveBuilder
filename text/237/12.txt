S i r ,
In r e p l y t o the l o t tor of Hisses Panola "Jorrocks and iviaria A. " f a l l i s , I would
l i k e t o inform them that Mr Duckett read the offending l i m e r i c k s (which I
had p r e v i o u s l y seen) a t my d i r e c t i o n .
In order t o p u b l i c i s e the L i m e r i c k Competition, i t was necessary t o disregard
the d e l i c a c i e s of c e r t a i n I.C.W.Arians and probably some R.C.S. men. To
a l l members present who suffered from the experience I s i n c e r e l y apologise.
