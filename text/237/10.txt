Although " M i n d at the end of its Tether," H . G . Wells' last book, seems
to have little meaning on first sight, M r . Schumacher thought that there was
a lot to be leamt from this work, if only in that Wells asks so many questions
to which he cannot find the answers that one is given an insight into his state
of mind when writing the book. . « » » . , „ . . „ t U

been somewhat d i s a p p o i n t i n g t o t h e

dicated that I C i s too insular.
T h e exhibits f e l l into t w o m a i n cate-
gories : the purely technical a n d those
w h i c h , t o some degree, encompassed
art a n d science. M r . C o r b y n ' s F o u r i e r

H a s k e l l s Shoe Shine device was m e r e l y
a p h o t o c e l l , a n d i n a d d i t i o n d i d n o t
w o r k ; it indicated that a bare (female)
foot was shinier t h a n a pair o f rea-
sonably p o l i s h e d black shoes. A
h o l o g r a m was exhibited b y Professor
G a b o r ; this t h o u g h interesting d i d
not have a n y apparent artistic value.
Several other exhibits fell into -this
class.
It is sad that this e x h i b i t i o n s h o u l d
produce such a n unsatisfactory over-
a l l i m p r e s s i o n . T h e theme o f the E x -
h i b i t i o n was excellent a n d i f it is r e -
peated, as w e hope i t w i l l be, perhaps
m o r e o f t h e exhibitors w i l l bear t h e
theme in Jhind.
