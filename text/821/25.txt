Feature
Christmas tree appeared in Britain.
It was introduced by Queen
Victoria's husband, the German-
born Prince Albert. Its popularity
increased from then on as it became
a part of the celebration of
Christmas. Decorations were also
added to the tree. Each with its own
story.
Decorating the Tree
The Star
The practice of decorating the
Christmas Tree with a star is a
reminder of the star which led the
three wise men to the birth place of
Jesus. Sometimes a doll is placed at
the top of the tree. Originally this
was supposed to represent the baby
Jesus or the Angel Gabriel, but
nowadays the doll often is dressed
as a fairy or a princess!
Tinsel
A legend is told to explain the
origins of tinsel: Once there was a
poor woman, working hard to
provide for her family. One night
some spiders spun their web on the
family's Christmas Tree and in
acknowledgement of the woman's
goodness, the Christ child turned
the webs to silver.
Christmas Cards
The first Christmas Card was made
in 1843 by Sir Henry Cole, founder
of the Victoria and Albert Museum,
London. The card was sent to Mr.
John Horsley and was titled
'Brimming Cheer'. It pictured a
family celebrating Christmas and
giving gifts of clothing and food to
the poor. It is on display in the
Victoria and Albert Museum.
Christmas Plays
In times before most people could
read, Bible stories were presented to
the eeneral public in the form of
plays. Christmas plays, or Nativity
plays as they are often called, which
depict the story of the birth of
Christ, are often performed in
schools at Christmas, and continue
this tradition.
The Christmas Gift Of Peace
On Christmas Eve 1914 it was cold
and frosty on the battle field.
German and British forces, in the
midst of World War I, stood facing
each other, separated by a strip of
no-man's land intersected with
barbed wire.
Suddenly, amazed British soldiers
saw lights come on along the line of
enemy trenches. Then came the
unbelievable sound of singing -
German soldiers singing 'Silent
Night, Holy Night'. When the
sound died away the British soldiers
replied with 'The First Noel'.
The singing by both sides went on
for an hour and was followed bv
invitations to cross over to enemy
lines. One German with great
courage began to walk across to the
British trenches, followed by other
Germans, hands in pockets, to
show that they had no weapons.
Men who had spent weeks trying to
kill each other now embraced, sang
and exchanged souvenirs and
chocolate. Even a football match was
organized...
When Christmas Day dawned
bright and cold, there was no sound
of rifles or gunfire. The men had
agreed among themselves to cease
fire. And for that one brief day peace
reigned on the battle front.
It has been almost 2,000 years
since the angels declared the Good
News of Jesus' birth to the
shepherds. 'Glory to God in the
highest, and on Earth peace, good
will toward men'. Sadly, much of
our world still knows very little of
that peace.
The story of Christmas
In those days Caesar Augustus
issued a decree that a census should
be taken of the entire Roman world.
(This was the first census that took
place while Quirinius was governor
of Syria.) And everyone went to his
own town to register.
So Joseph also went up from the
town of Nazareth in Galilee to
Judea, to Bethlehem the town of
David, because he belonged to the
house and line of David. He went
there to register with Mary, who
was pledged to be married to him
and was expecting a child. While
they were there, the time came for
the baby to be born, and she gave
birth to her firstborn, a son. She
wrapped him in cloths and placed
him in a manger, because there was
no room for them in the inn.
And there were shepherds living
out in the fields nearby, keeping
watch over theirflocksat night. An
angel of the Lord appeared to them,
and the glory of the Lord shone
around them, and they were
terrified. But the angel said to them,
"Do not be afraid. I bring you good
news of great joy that will be for all
the people. Today in the town of
David a Saviour has been born to
you; he is Christ the Lord. This will
be a sign to you: You will find a
baby wrapped in cloths and lying in
a manger."
Suddenly a great company of the
heavenly host appeared with the
angel, praising God and saying,
"Glory to God in the highest, and
on earth peace to men on whom his
favour rests."
When the angels had left them
and gone into heaven, the
shepherds said to one another,
"Let's go to Bethlehem and see this
thing that has happened, which the
Lord has told us about."
So they hurried off and found
Mary and Joseph, and the baby,
who was lying in the manger. When
they had seen him, they spread the
word concerning what had been
told them about this child, and all
who heard it were amazed at what:
the shepherds said to them. But
Mary treasured up all these things
and pondered them in her heart.
The shepherds returned, glorifying
and praising God for all the things
they had heard and seen, which
were just as they had been told.
