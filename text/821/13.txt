Life: a meaning
Sheldrake is one of of several to mix
biology with philosophy/religion
others being the Gaia Hypothesis
and Creationism.
The crux of this argument is in his
ideas on creativity where he talks of
things from below and above and
introduces oriental mystical ideas.
Like Creationists before him he has
a set of spiritual beliefs that he is
trying to substantiate in scientific
terms and is trying to prove a 'God'
in scientific theories. Such science
is often of a low quality, being based
on poor methodology, equivocal
evidence and tenuous interpretation
of data, eg the decay of the speed
of light curve wildly exaggerated by
Creationists and used with doubts
over carbon dating to show how the
geological time scale can be 'fitted'
to the Biblical one.
Must science and religion be
concurrent, non-overlapping facets
of life leaving those with views on
both in an almost intellectually
'schizophrenic' state? It is obvious
that Sheldrake has based his
thinking^ on observed biological
phenomenon with, as yet, no
unequivocal explanation and has
used his theosophical ideas based
around mysticism to explain these
phenomena in a supposedly
scientific manner. There are current
moves in Islamic circles to put
forward Islamic interpretations of
science and conversely Christian
Scientists and Scientologists have
tried to view God in scientific terms.
However, in all honesty if the role
of science is to provide an objective
analysis of the natural world by an
experimental hypothesis method
then it is not possible to view it in
a religious dimension as such a
dimension cannot be objectively
assessed. This is not, however, to
say that the spiritual dimension is
worthless, rather the areas should
0*
be viewed in their own right and
any overlap or interplay between
them should be restricted to the
philosophical and not the scientific
realm. Indeed, instead of seeing
science and religion as being
contradictory as is often the case,
they may instead be seen as
complementary facets of life.
One can in some ways sympathise
with Sheldrake for challenging
current biological thinking. That
often mentioned concept of
scientific inertia does in many ways
plague biology. Evolution is often
taught as fact and not theory and
progress is often hindered by
outdated classifications and schools
of thought.
Science, instead, must be seen in
a more dynamic and equivocal
manner with a greater exchange of
ideas and more critical examination
of ideas and facts.

This once a year pastime need no
longer be a boring drag, as with the
aid of your FELIX guide we hope to
bring some fun into this event.
A mere ten minute walk from
College is that rather famous place
'Harold' where the OK Ya! from
'Clarm' go shopping. However, it
is not as an expensive rip-off as
many believe and is definitely worth
a visit. First head for the food hall
and get a little Christmas spirit with
Harrods own 15 year-old malt
whisky at a mere £15.20. In the
confectionary section a marzipan
Father Christmas can be found for
a fiver and a large hand-made sweet
selection in a basket for £40. On
passing through to the Edwardian
Christmas section don't miss the
three foot high 'Hansel & Gretel'
house made of gingerbread and
marzipan and the Edwardian
exhibition itself is quaintly pleasant
and interesting. Finally for Harry
it's up to the top floor for the toy
isection passing the half hour queue
for the Edwardian circus en route.
Here you'll find every Motor Club
member's dream: a Ferrari Testarosa
scaled down to a kiddies version,
fully working with petrol engine—
a snip at £12,500.
Now fight your way down to
Knightsbridge tube as the next stop
is Piccadilly Circus and Tower
Records where some off beat stuff
was discovered. Take Bing Crosby
and White Christmas for £2.49 (give
it to Grandma) give all science
fiction bugs the Dr Who theme
imusic for £5.29, for Monty Python
fans 'The Life of Brian' soundtrack
at £6.99 and for the more nostalgic,
'Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club
Band' is £6.99.
Next head up Regent Street and
you'll pass Dunn and Co where you
Scottish beret for a Hogmany Party
is £7 and if you're fed up of your
father's seventies kipper ties buy
him a 'Christmas wrapping paper'
silk one from the Tie Rack (£12.99).
Of course, Hamley's had to be
visited—everyone is a kid at heart.
For those keen academics, a
chemistry set is approximately £20,
and electronics set (level 3)—£69 and
a Merit microscope and slide set for
£39. For the stupid hacks in the
Union, who can't walk home
straight after a party without falling
over a baby walker at £25 might be
useful.
. A right hand ciiveisioii into
Carnaby Street is worth it for those
into their fashions but it is not cheap
and it's Christmas decorations are
awful. However, nip up to Great
Marlborough Street and the Poster
Shop and for the richer among you
Andy Warhol's 'Cars' posters in
colour (A2 size) at £27 are
recommended. Just down the road
from here is Liberty's with a distinct
medieval Christmas flavour and
some good pressies for the ladies.
On approaching Oxford Street
beware of the monster raving loony
traffic wardens with megaphones
acting as an advanced form of
lollipop person! Oxford Street is
long and bland consisting of mainly
clothes shops but there are a few
gems. For U2 addicts still minus a
rattling hum, £6.99 at Virgin is the
cheapest. While in the maiden shop,
if you have any well cool friends, get
them Acid Beats 2 at £6.40 for the
latest in LSD bops. Selfridges' book
section has 'The Snowman' by
Raymond Briggs (£6.95) and a good
after dinner read especially for
Indsoc members) is Norman
Tebbit's 'Upwardly Mobile'. While
you're there go and see Father
Christmas as well. Athena has
'Beach Party—the last resort' at £4
iwith plenty of useful ideas as to
ibeing a Costa del Thug.
At last Athena has two presents
for our beloved President Nigel
Baker: 'The Noddy Treasury' (£8)
and the
89 'Bros' annual (£5) which
combined with the 'Bros Chistmas
Gift Box' from Tower Records at
£9.99 should make Nige's Christmas
one of ecstacy.
However, if the real life spoofs
called Nige, Chas and Wendy aren't
good enough then play the 'Spitting
Image Game' from Virgin (£12.99).
A quick perambulation
down Charing Cross Road and
Long Acre and you hit Covent
Garden. Excellent for Christmas
coffee on the plaza it has an
authentic festive spirit
complemented with fairground
rides. If the shopping's hitting a rut,
head for the General Store where
something for everyone should be
found for a few quid.
