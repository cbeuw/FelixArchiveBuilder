'Well it looks like a Death Star'
Willow
Empire, Leicester Square
Enter the world of Willow. A world
of hopes and dreams, myth and
magic, good and evil. Forget all you
know or think you know.
George Lucas, master storyteller
and Star Wars creator presents us
with a daring tale of exciting
adventure, conflict between right
and wrong, and ultimately the
victory of compassion, virtue and
friendship.
The tale follows a path across a
war-torn land of sorcerors, rebels,
trolls and all manner of evil. A
mishmash of every previous
adventure you care to recall is the
result, and consequently it is lacning
only in originality.
In turn we see elements of The
Hobbit, The Story ofMoses, Gulliver's
Travels, Raiders of the Lost Arc, Sinbad
and even The Perils of Penelope
Pitstop. Mostly it is a reworking of
the Star Wars trilogy, in story,
content and characterisation.
Willow is a dwarf-like creature,
member of the Nelwyn race, and
budding but unconfident sorceror.
His people are primarily farmers
and mines, and while that may
suggest his being Welsh, it reminds
me of Luke Skywalker.
He is aided considerably by
Madmartigan, an outcast Daikini
warrior played by Val Kilmer (Top
Gun). He may look like Mel Gibson
and act like Kurt Russell, but this
character is pure Harrison Ford
material. Han Solo, come on down!
Romantic interest rears its soppy
head in the shape of Sorsha,
daughter of evil Queen Bavmorda.
Sacrificed
Youth
Cert PG, ICA from December 9
Li, seventeen, a young Chinese girl
from an unspecified 'city', is
plunged into a completely different
country culture, in the Dai minority
in China. Arriving in her regulation
jeans and loose grey shirt, she is the
'educated' girl who doesn't know
how to flirt amongst the Dai girls
who swim naked in the river, and
pay ten cents a time to look in a full
length mirror for twenty seconds.
'We were taught that beauty lies
in simplicity' say Li. So, perhaps it
She's an evil bitch who gradually
becomes entangled with enemy
Madmartigan as he crusades
around, ever the dashing
companion, and classic hapless
rogue.
Elsewhere we see the Emperor,
Darth Vadar, Obi Wan Kenobi and
Lando Calrissian, loosely disguised,
and supporting a plot we all know
backwards. Even R2-D2 and C-3PO
are present, as two argumentative
nine inch fairies, Rool and
Frangean. Their timing is superb,
their wit is not. They add little,
does, but she is inhibited by this
doctrine, and it is only when she
adopts the long skirt and bright
colours of the Dai girls that she can
come to terms with her own
sensuality.
Sacrificed Youth watches this
development, and it is also a tribute
to the Dai people for whom beauty
is a way of life.
The film is very pretty to look at,
however, it is saved from shallow
sentiment, and seems not to notice
the easy path (trodden by many
previous, western film makers) of
patronising women, seeing them as
beauty only. I defy any woman not
to identify with Li, who buys
medical books eagerly at the
secondhand stall in the village, and
has the authority to walk in and
save a boy's life when he is
poisoned, is surrounded by
supersitious chantings and-
exorcisms. The dual qualities of
detract much and prove to be quite
irritating.
Willow is a film with high points
and low points. Val Kilmer is
undoubtedly the pinnacle and steals
the show. The special effects are
quite convincing (though the same
team have done better), and the
sets, costume and photography
combine to provide a feast for the
eyes.
The lowpoints are more difficult
to single out. The script is weak in
places and some of the acting poor
(notably Warwick Davies as
sensuality and intelligence, go hand
in hand. 'At last', at last, at last' I
think it is wonderful to watch.
It is easy to identify with Li.
Arriving in her blue jeans and flat
black pumps, she could be any
European kid, suddenly swept into
an alien culture, this helps make
Sacrificed Youth very accessible to
western eyes. As close to Li's almost
complete conversion to the Dai way,
we have Ren Jia, a young man in the
same situation as Li, but who will
not accept his new lifestyle. It is he
who points out that the Dai girls
have their 'fun' for only a few years,
and then they are married and then
black-toothed grannies...but it is he,
also, who laments the upbringing
that had made him unable to
express his feelings directly. They
have been raised in a 'sophisticated'
fashion, and have lost the
spontaneity and instinctiveness of
youth.
Willow). There is a general feeling
of incompleteness, and the movie
remains shallow. It needs more
novelty to offer any challenge to Star
Wars, and to be frank it could never
parallel the true masterpiece.
Willow is the perfect film for taking
young relatives to see this
Christmas. It's a mixture of fun,
excitement and fantasy. Bu then so
is Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and that
is quite simply more entertaining.
Andrew Clarke.
The conflicts between these two
cultures are not laboured, and the
storyline is quite absorbing. It is easy
to draw parallels between what is on
screen and one's own life, helping
us to examine our own attitudes and
consider our own personalities, this
is the most important contribution
that cinema has to make to the
consumer, aside from sheer
entertainment.
Beauty in Sacrificed Youth is an
inherent quality. Because of this,
every character has their own
dignity. The acting is well-
mannered and natural, the
photography pleasing and the film,
as a whole, well put together,
flowing with warmth and implicit
humour. This has to be worth 96
minutes of anybody's precious time.
