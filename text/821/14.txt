Why not amaze or enchant your
friends by cooking a communial
Christmas dinner for your flat or
hall landing?
Roast turkey with sausages, bread
sauce, stuffing and gravy, roast
potatoes, boiled potatoes, brussel
sprouts and carrots; Christmas
pudding and brandy butter.
It is probably easiest to buy an
oven-ready frozen turkey. Allow
about %lb per person e.g. a 61b
turkey for 8 people. Thaw the
turkey for about 24 hours. Place the
stuffing (packet stuffing is easiest)
into the neck end of the body cavity.
Rub a little salt and pepper into the
skin to season it. Place the turkey in
a roasting tin, resting on small dabs
of butter, and cover with rashers of
bacon (this gives a tasty tang to the
turkey skin). Cook at 230 C/450 F or
gas mark 8, allowing about 15
minutes for every pound, plus 45
minutes.
To make the roast potatoes, peel
one or two potatoes per person and
place around the turkey about 1 x
k
hours before the end of cooking.
Spoon a little of the fat over the
potatoes. Turn over halfway
through cooking.
Approximately % hour before the
end of cooking place the small
sausages around the turkey. Spoon
fat over them and turn once during
cooking.
To make the bread sauce, put Vi
pint of milk into a pan and season
with salt and pepper. Add two or
three slices of bread crumbled into
breadcrumbs (stale bread works
better!) and warm gently for 15
minutes. Heat the sauce rapidly just
before serving.
Make the gravy when the turkey
has finished cooking. Remove it, the
potatoes and the sausages from the
roasting tin (place them on a plate
and keep them warm in the cooling
oven). Pour away most of the fat
(but not directly down the sink) and
put the roasting tin on a hot ring.
Add a little flour to the fat and let
it cook and thicken, then dilute the
gravy with water (using water from
the vegetables improves the flavour)
until you get the thickness you like.
Alternatively you can make gravy
from a packet, but it really doesn't
taste the same.
Vegetables: peel or scrape the
carrots. It is more impressive to cut
them into strips about 1 Vi" long.
Place in salted water, bring to the
boil and simmer for about 20
minutes. Peel the potatoes and cut
them into evenly sized chunks.
Cook similarly to the carrots, but for
30-35 minutes. Prepare the sprouts
by slicing off the end of the stalk.
Remove the outer 2 or 3 leaves and
make crosswise cuts into the base of
the stalk (this allows the sprouts to
cook more thoroughly). Place them
in a pan, salt and pour boiling water
over them. Bring back to the boil
and simmer for 20-25 minutes.
Christmas pudding and
Brandy butter
Buy your Christmas pudding: it is
far too late to make one as it requires
about eight hours cooking and
several months for the flavour to
mature!
To make the Brandy butter, cream
(i.e. put the butter in a bowl and
soften using the back of a wooden
spoon to press the butter against the
side of the bowl) 3oz butter until
pale and soft. Beat in 3oz of caster
sugar gradually and then add 2-3
tablespoons of Brandy slowly
(taking care not to let the mixture
curdle). Leave the butter to harden
before serving.
Vegetarian Menu.
Vegetarians do not eat nut roasts for
Christmas dinner. What they do eat
is Mushroom Timbale. The recipe is
as follows (quoted from Not Just A
Load Of Old Lentils by Rose Elliot,.
Fontana 1972):
Ingredients
1 large onion 8 flat mushrooms 2
tomatoes, skinned 2 oz butter 1 tbs
flour Vi pint water 1 tsp yeast extract
1 heaped tsp mixed herbs 8 oz finely
grated cashewnuts 8 oz soft
breadcrumbs 2 eggs salt and pepper
to garnish:
1 tomato, sliced
1 lemon, sliced
a few sprigs of parsley
Method
Peel the onion and chop finely;
wash and finely chop 4 of the
mushrooms and slice the tomatoes;
saute together gently in the butter
for 10 minutes, then add the flour.
Stir for a minute, then add the
water, yeast extract and herbs. Stir
until thickened, then add the rest of
the ingredients. Line a 21b loaf tin
with foil then brush thoroughly with
melted butter. Place the remaining
4 mushrooms,black side down in
the bottom of the tin, spoon the
mixture on top, smooth over and
cover with more buttered foil, tying
securely with string. Steam for two
hours. Cool for 2 minutes, then turn
out of the tin onto a large warm
serving dish and remove the foil.
Surround with roast potatoes.
Garnish top with a row of alternate
slices of tomato and lemon, and
some sprigs of parsley.
Serves 4 to 5 people Serve with
Sauce Espagnole
1 tbs oil 1 onion, peeled 1 clove
garlic, peeled 2 tbs. flour 1 Vi pints
