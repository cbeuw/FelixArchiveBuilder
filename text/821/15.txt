WITHTHE CREAM OFTHE UK'SEMPLOYERS
Whatever your discipline, whether you're a
final year, Masters, PhD student or a
recent graduate, if you are looking into career
opportunities in IT, computing, scientific
research, applied science, engineering,
technology, banking, sales and marketing,
corporate finance, management consultancy,
or production management, it makes sense to
maximise the number of employers you can talk
to at any one time. That's why attending an
INTRO Graduate Recruitment Fair is such a good
idea. In just a couple of hours you can talk to all
the employers listed opposite.
You'll also be able to attend - free of charge -
the seminars provided by Pauline Hyde &
Associates, offering expert advice on preparing
your career details and effective interview
technique.
The Fairs also include a Video Theatre showing
a continuous programme of features about the
exhibiting employers.
Please bring copies of your
Curriculum Vitae or completed
SAF. If you require further
information, telephone the
organiser, INTRO, on
Henley-on-Thames (0491) 410222
