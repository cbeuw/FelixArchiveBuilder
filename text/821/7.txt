Gospel is
original
Enoch Powell delivered a lecture to
the HG Wells Society last week on
the topic of 'Textual Criticism'
basing his case on the sequence of
authorships of the New Testament.
Mr Powell, who is a former
Professor of classics, defined textual
criticism as 'the science of art of
restoring the authors' true intention
when it has been lost'. He has
examined second century AD Greek
documents for contradictions
between text and context, and has
found the first Gospel of Matthew
to be the original.
Intercollegiate perks go
Mascotry
City & Guilds Union's mascots,
Spanner and Bolt were returned to
them last Tuesday by the Royal
College of Science Union (RCSU).
City and Guilds raised £1,100 for
Great Ormond Street Hospital's
Wishing Well Appeal, in the ransom
of their mascots.
RCSU VP, Dave Williams said
afterwards, 'Same again next year
boys'.

Computer
thefts
An IBM computer, worth £3,500,
was stolen from the Chemical
Engineering building on Monday.
On the subject of police
investigations into computer thefts
within IC, Head of Security Geoff
Reeves said, T have to confess we
haven't got a great deal'.
Astroturf
IC Union will spend £350,000 on an
'Astroturf' pitch at Harlington the
College sports ground.
The pitch will be used for hockey
predominantly, but will have
facilities for football use. It will be
used for tennis during the summer
months, said ICU President Nigel
Baker.
The tenders for the work have to
be presented by the end of term and
the work will be finished by October
1989.
I.C. students who spend their first
year in Inter-Collegiate Halls will no
longer be guaranteed a year's
residence in I.C. accomodation. The
move comes as a result of the
increased pressure on the
Accommodation Office as the
under-graduate fresher and post-
graduate overseas intake increases.
IC students were previously
encouraged to apply to
intercollegiate Halls since the
number of applicants accepted was
set as a proportion of those
applying.
Imperial College now has a
guaranteed number of places
available to it in intercollegiate halls
after changes to intake procedures.
In future students applying for
first-year accommodation in College
will be asked to choose between IC
and intercollegiate accommodation.
The Students Residence Committee
(SRC) hopes that an increased
number of freshers will be housed
in Inter-Collegiate Halls, thus
providing IC with more space to
house its overseas postgraduate
first-year students.
At present all freshers, except
those living in the Greater London
postal districts, are guaranteed a
place in residence. This year,
however, the guarantee required all
but 20 of the 1,700 places available
in IC residence. Although 160 of the
places were subsequently released
for re-allocation, Dr Levitt of the
SRC described the statistics as 'too
close for comfort'. He believes the
new system will increase the
College's capacity to house freshers,
re-apps and overseas postgraduate
students. He hopes that freshers
presently in inter-collegiate
accommodation will be unaffected
by the change and that the
Accommodation Office will be able
to honour its original claims and
house those who wish to spend a
subsequent year in I.C.
accommodation.
Union President Nigel Baker
expressed doubts about the
proposals. T can't see people opting
to go and live five miles away when
they could be in College', he said.
Council sketch
Anyone listening to 1C radio's news
bulletin would be forgiven for
thinking that the Union had agreed
to purchase a fish tank for the Union
Office. They were close; at Monday
night's Council (the decision
making body of the Union) a motion
calling for a 'think tank' of ex-
students to be set up was approved.
The business moved swiftly on to
a motion designed to prevent
societies such as Industrial Society
spending externally generated
income on dinners for its members.
The motion was put forward by Mr
Baker in a remarkable U-turn after
initially approving the idea of a
dinner for the society. Under the
terms of the motion, externally
generated income used for
'gratuities' should first be approved
by Union Finance Committee
(UFC). The motion was passed
despite protestations from the
FELIX Editor who claimed that it
would make utilising the FELIX
Staff Fund, recently approved by
Publications Board very difficult.
Gavin Spittlehouse presented his
report on this years Careers Fair,
(Mr Spittlehouse represents the
Union as both the Chairperson of
the Industrial Relations Sub-
committee and the treasurer of
Industrial Society). He calculated
that the Fair had generated £10,000
profit, but the bone of contention
was should Ind Soc receive payment
for the Fair?
Council finally degenerated when
an irate FELIX Editor, Bill Goodwin
asked the executive to explain the
setting up of a committee to look
into the standard of FELIX. Mr
Goodwin asked the Exec to explain
why he had not been informed
about the committee, the reasons for
it being set up, and why he had not
been invited to attend the meeting.
Union President Nigel Baker
responded that the Exec wished to
meet before approaching the Editor
so that they could first discuss the
perceived problems amongst
themselves. City and Guilds
president Ralph Greenwell said that
the committee had been set up
because of complaints that the
Guilds cocktail cards printed by the
Print Unit had to be reprinted when
they were discovered to be covered
with inky fingerprints, and because
Guilds were unhappy about paying
for advertisments in FELIX.
Mr Goodwin retorted that if there
had been any complaints then he
should have been informed and
pointed out that other clubs and
CCU's pay for their advertisments.
Competition

annual Futurist Competition for

European countries to compete for

university.

Wine
whipped
Over £150 worth of wine and spirits
was stolen from IC Wine Tasting
Society's locker in the Union
Building over the weekend. The 30
bottles of wine , brandy and port
and two cases of beer were stolen
after thieves forced the locker open.
The theft came after WineSoc's
'duty-free' trip to France. The drink
stolen belonged to the club and
members. WineSoc Chairman,
Emma Simpson said, 'whoever did
it either knew we'd gone (to France)
or was just bloody lucky.'
ICU Deputy President said he
'very much doubted' the incident
would be insured against.
Winner
G Copland of Mineral Resources
Engineering wins the one gallon
bottle of whisky in the FELIX
'Alcohol Awareness Week
Competition', correctly answering
the four difficult questions.
Come and collect the prize from
the FELIX Office. FELIX
recommends not to drink it all at
once!
And finally...
(FELIX would like to thank Nick
Wright for producing the Christmas
cover. Nick worked solidly from
8pm until 2am to produce an
excellent design for which we are
extremely grateful.
