On Tuesday the sixth of December
at 3.38pm at the Tower of London
Pier, the mascots of City & Guilds
College Union, Spanner and Bolt,
were exchanged with the Royal
College of Science Union for a
cheque for £1,100.
The Vice Presidents of the
respective unions shook hands and
the deal was done, C&GU had
regained pocession of their long lost
mascots.
This is the true, public image of
mascotry, the story that should be
hitting the headlines.. Mascotry is
solely concerned with raising money
for charity and maintaining the
pride of one's own college by
preventing the loss of one's own
mascot. This often results in some
hair-raising moments and massive
adrenalin surges, but in the end it's
all good honest, clean fun as any
mascoteer will tell you.
The current tale of Spanner and
Bolt all started back on the 22nd of
March last year, C&GU had just
finished holding their elections
UGM. Naturally the mascots had
been in attendance as had a rival
mascotry team from the Royal
College of Science. Plans were afoot
and two taxis containing RCS men
attempted to follow the car in which
Spanner and Bolt were leaving
College. The first taxi was soon
spotted and lost quickly by the
Guild's car. Not thinking anything
was amiss, the C&G UGM departed
quickly to the Queen's Arms to
celebrate the successes of the
elections.
However, doom lay on the
horizon, for, in the car with Spanner
and Bolt, was an RCS man closely
covered by another RCS man in the
second taxi.
After following a random route
around the backstreets of London,
the car returned to the College area,
j dropping its occupants at the
[Queen's Arms. The car and mascots
then went for another little wander
before being parked behind
Linstead. Due to skillful driving by
the second taxi driver, the RCS man
was still behind the Guild's car,
watching all that went on. With this
information of the location of the
mascots, the RCS soon gained
access to the car boot.
A sense of excitement swept
around those present, somewhat
akin to the thrill of finding the Holy
Grail. The RCS wasted no time in
speeding off into the distance and
safety, later returning to the bar to
celebrate.
Because of impending exams in
the following term both sides
decided that the recovery tasks were
best left until the new year. This
term has thus seen extensive
operations by C&GU in carrying out
a number of tasks set by RCS.
The term started with the C&G
executive officers offering to show
their knees for 50p. This was very
successful and resulted in a very
strange response from the Rector.
The Guild's scarf was also strung
across Beit Quad welcoming the
freshers to IC. Later that week
Guilds collected on their freshers'
pub crawl, whilst the C&G exec,
tastefully dressed themselves as the
RCSU mascot, Theta.
Dressed in drag at RCS Freshers'
Bar Night, Guilds were told that the
following week they were expected
to 'busk' outside Mech Eng. Here
we discovered not only could
Guilds juggle the books, but they
could juggle tennis balls as well.
The human coffee machine in the
JCR is best left unmentioned, but is
included for completeness as people
liked and trusted the automatic
machines far more.
We were soon to see several
members of Guild's Motor Club
quickly moving, repairing and
locking cars, as C&G were told to
organise a scrap metal collection
around College.
It was now getting close to
Christmas so it was decided to send
C&GU off to Leicester Square, carol
singing. Unfortunately, the noise
was so bad that they were moved
on by the police. Later Guilds were
sent into the College car park, first
washing cars and then charging staff
a nominal fee for entry in the
morning. We must not forget that
everyone who bought a pizza at the
Beer Festival was helping to raise
money for the recovery fund.
All this brings us to Tuesday,
December 6th. After being told to
make themselves available, the
Guild's Office received a telephone
call at 11.50am telling them to go to
a telephone box for further
instructions, then another box, and
then another...finally, after spelling
RCS across a map of London, they
arrived at the Tower of London
where the mascots were finally
returned.
There used to be a time when each
College withir. the University of
London partook in the thrills of
mascotry. It now is left as almost the
sole duty of the colleges of IC and
the medical schools.
A number of London colleges still
keep mascots; these include Queen
Mary College (a large plaster
leopard), Kings College (a 6001b
concrete and brass lion), St
Bartholemew Hospital (a very large
penguin made from beer barrels),
City University (a concrete carrot).
Though they are mascots and all
violate (ie they don't mind being
stolen) the colleges themselves
don't have active teams who are out
to steal other mascots. Even
Imperial College has a mascot, Mike
the Micrometer, which is
occasionally seen at UGM's, if the
Deputy President can be bothered
to bring it out. It is a fully working
micrometer and until it was
dropped by a team from QMC, was
accurate to 10,000th of an inch. This
mascot was built in 1966 to replace
the previous violate mascot of ICU,
Herbert the Phoenix (hence the
phoenix on your Union card).
Herbert was named after IC's most
famous alumni, HG Wells. He was
lost in 1964 to persons unknown,
and nothing has been seen of him
ever since. Mike was constructed
jointly by the CCU's, being cast in
the Mines, machined in Guilds and
calibrated by the RCS.
There is a strong 'spirit' within
mascotry, as it is very much a team
game. There are rules which are
meant to ensure people don't just
beat up each other to gain posession
of a mascot. All the best and most
successful raids have employed
cunning or just plain opportunism
at the ineptitude of the opposition.
Mascotry at IC has come under
criticism over recent years, many
seeing it as trivial and an excuse for
a bunch of hacks to be even more
important. Hopefully the £1,100
raised for Great Ormond Street
Hospital by the theft of Spanner and
Bolt will raise interest and action
into an activity which receives no
financial support from the unions,
and yet is fun, exciting and very
worthwhile.
Dave Williams,
RCS Vice President.
