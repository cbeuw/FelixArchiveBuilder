good for society because it helps to
eliminate disability. But can
eliminating disability at the expense
of eliminating the disabled really be
called a good thing? Scientific
research and the development of
new surgical techniques provide far
more effective means of doing this.
Rape is another situation often
cited as a justifications for abortion.
Although it is a terrible crime
deserving of severe punishment, is
it right to kill the innocent unborn
child who may be conceived?
An important point is made in the
book 'New Perspectives on Human
Abortion', in which psychologists

case of rape victims who become
pregnant, '...the pregnant victim's
problems stem more from the
trauma of the rape than from the
pregnancy itself.'
In the long run it is often found
that the abortion is self-defeating in
the sense that it may give the
mother more emotional problems
than if she'd gone the full term and
had the baby adopted. In actual fact
there is now a recognised condition
called Post-Abortion Syndrome. It
is akin to the disorder shown by
Vietnam veterans who repressed
their experiences then, years later
showed emotional problems.
Symptoms include recurrent
dreams of the abortion or unborn
child, reduced capacity for feeling or
expressing emotions and guilt.
A very common pro-abortion
argument is to simply assert that it
is 'a woman's right to choose'. In
many issues, this sort of assertion
is perfectly justifiable. However, it
is not logical to extend this
argument to the case of abortion
where the 'rights' of the unborn
child must also be taken into
account. Genetically,
physiologically and organically the
foetus is distinct from the mother.
Surely the unborn child's 'right to
life' exceeds the mother's 'right to
choose'.
It is also true to say that whilst the
mother and father had the 'right to
choose' to prevent the mother from
becoming pregnant, they didn't
exercise their right. After
conception, the 'right to choose' no
longer exists.
The Methods
There are three main methods of
carrying out an abortion. The first
invades the uterus from below; the
second involves the use of drugs
which poison the unborn child and
then empty the uterus through
subsequent labour and delivery. The
third invades the uterus from above.
All three methods are quite
nauseating and if you are at all
squeamish, I would suggest that
you skip the next six paragraphs.
However do note that these
methods are used to carry out over
170,000 abortions every year in
England and Wales, and their
barbarity does in itself constitute an
argument against abortion.
In the first category falls the
Suction-Aspiration method. This is
the most commonly used technique.
It involves the insertion of a hollow
plastic tube—which has a knifelike
edge around the top—into the
uterus. The suction from this tube
is about 30 times as powerful as a
home vacuum cleaner and so tears
the baby's body to pieces. The
placenta is cut from the inner wall
of the uterus and the scraps sucked
out into a bottle.
The Dilatation and Curettage
method. This method is similar to
the suction method except that the
abortionist inserts a curette, a loop-
shaped steel knife, into the uterus.
With this the placenta and foetus are
cut into pieces and scraped out into
a basin. Bleeding is usually profuse.
The third 'blow uterus' method is
called Dilitation and Evacuation. As
this method is used in later months,
a pliers-like instrument is needed
because the baby's bones and skull
have calcified. There is no
anaesthetic for the baby. The Doctor
inserts the instrument up into the
uterus, siezes a leg or other part of
the body and, with a twisting
motion, tears it from the baby's
body. This is repeated again and
again. The spine must be snapped
and the skull crushed in order to
remove them. The nurse's job is to
reassemble the body parts to be sure
that all have been removed.
In the second category is the
Prostaglandin abortion. This
involves the injection of the human

to care
hormone Prostin E2 which results in
violent labour and the delivery of
whatever size baby the mother is
carrying. The baby is usually too
small to survive the traumatic
labour.
The most common third category
abortion is the Hysterectomy. This
is similar to an early Caesarean
section. The mother's abdomen is
surgically opened, as is her uterus.
The baby is then lifted out with the
placenta discarded. This method is
used particularly in the case of late
pregnancies.
Alternatives
Once again we ask ourselves why
attitudes have changed so much
since the statement by the World
Medical Federation in 1949 which
quoted earlier. Forty years ago,
abortion was not acceptable to most
people. Now it has become almost
commonplace. I don't say this
lightly. In 1987, 174,246 abortions
were carried out in England and
Wales and the number is rising
every year.
One main reason for the
widespread acceptability of abortion
is its legality. The Abortion Act was
passed in 1967 and allows abortions
to be carried out on both 'medical'
and 'social' grounds. Reading the
transcripts of the debates which
took place in Parliament at the time,
it is hard not to notice the stress
placed upon the point that this bill
•was only intended for so-called
'hard cases' eg severely disabled
foetuses, victims of rape. There was
no intention to introduce Abortion
on Demand. However the legal
interpretation of the act has
produced just this. A survey of
Gynaecologists in 1988 GALLUP
showed that 72% had found that
'abortion on demand' existed in
some of the NHS hospitals in which
they had worked. 83% considered
it to be available in the private (free-
charging) sector.
There is additionally a belief that
legality implies moral correctness.
Would we accept this argument as
a justification of apartheid in South
Africa?
Another reason for its
acceptability is the prevalent
ignorance of the issues involved.
Most students are much better
informed abot nuclear disarmament,
apartheid and ecological matters.
What you don't know about you
can't take issue with.
At Imperial College it is the society
called PATA which campaigns on
these on these pro-life issues. The
initials PATA stand for Positive
Alternatives To Abortion. As the
name suggests, we are not solely
negative in our approach to
abortion. We also wish to stress that
there are alternatives to abortion
and that there are things which can
be done to lessen the need for
abortion.
The main alternative to abortion
is adoption. For many years the
demand to adopt has been very
great. According to the British
Adoption and Fostering agency,
there are at least 100 applications per
baby available for adoption. It is
perversely ironic that while such a
demand to have a child to love and
care for exists, over 170,000 unborn
children are being aborted annually.
Although the use of contraception
may help to prevent parents from
resorting to abortion, the fact that no
contraceptive is 100% effective must
also be taken into account. Even if
a human life has been created
unintentionally then the only moral
choice is to proceed with the
pregnancy. It should also be noted
that some contraceptives are
actually abortion devices as they
artificially prevent the fertilised
embryo from lodging in the womb.
The best way to reduce the
demand for abortion is to find the
reasons and then to address them.
One main reason is the financial
burden of bringing up children. This
factor is particularly relevant in the
case of the disabled.
A solution to this problem is for
society to put a greater emphasis on
helping to share this burden.
Pragmatically, this means that
public opinion should encourage
government to give greater support
to those with children. Facilities for
the disabled should also be better
funded.
Even if the result of this may be
slightly higher taxes, surely this
would be a small price to pay for a
more caring and civilised society.
