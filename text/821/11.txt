ASTURIAS
A tiny little mountain kingdom,
tucked away on the northern coast.
In fact, the only part of Spain that
wasn't invaded by the Moors,
unspoilt by the Brits as well. You
can understand why if you try
getting into the kingdom by public
transport—the mountains are quite
an obstacle. The capital is Oviedo,
a rather dull city, nice cathedral. The
real reasons to visit Asturias are the
mountains and the coast, along
which a privately owned railway
track runs. The scenery is
wonderful, thousands of tiny rocky
coves washed by the Atlantic,
interspersed with the occasional
fishing village, where the locals will
greet you with warmth. The
wonderful thing about Asturias is
that only the Spanish go there on
holiday, and there aren't many of
them even! (The Atlantic is quite
warm here as well.)
Be sure to try Sidra Asturiana
while you are visiting, just like
scrumpy, except for the customary
method of serving it. The barman
will remove the cork with his teeth,
lift the bottle above his head and
then pour the amber nectar into the
glass, held at knee level, without
spilling a drop. You can also stuff
yourself extremely cheaply in the
familyjun restaurants, try the local
stew or squid straight from the sea.
PAMPLONA
Situated in Navarra, in the foothills
of the Pyrennes, this industrial city
is famous for the fiesta of San
Fermin, the running of the bulls
which is held from July 7th to 14th
every year. In fact, there's not a lot
of reason to visit the city at any other
time, but while the fiesta is in full
swing, it's the best in Europe.
Dump your bags at the municipal
bag depot and forget about sleeping,
everyone else does.
The day is spent sleeping off the
booze ready for another night's
festivities. Late in the afternoon you
will be passed by locals carrying
buckets of Sangria into the bull ring,
ready . for the main event; the
fighting of the bulls that ran in the
morning. At about 6pm, the ring
explodes with music as innumerable
bands with banners, flags and
empty Sangria buckets burst from
the arena and begin to parade
through the city. At this point you
can wander outside the city walls to
watch tomorrow's bulls beingi
delivered or retire to a bar for some
liquid refreshment before the
mighty fire work display. When this
is over things really begin to
swing—you can spend all night
wandering the narrow streets,
where nearly every shop has
become a temporary bar, dance in
the streets or visit the park where
bands play all night.
And when dawn breaks, it is time
to collect outside the bull ring for the
best views of the running—or
perhaps time to prepare oneself for
the bulls? The bulls thunder past,
and another day begins, time for a
rest before the next night's
festivities!
GRANADA
In the foothills of the Sierra Nevada,
Granada was the last city to fall to
the Christians, in the year that
Colombus set sail for the New
World. Visit Granada for the
Alhambra, the beautiful palace of
the Moorish kings that was meant
to imitate heaven on earth. You can
certainly believe they suceeded as
you wander through the courtyards
with fountains playing continuously
in the sunlight or stroll the cool
paths of the gardens, the Generalife.
Granada is in Andalucia, the hot
dusty south of Spain. Down here,
red wine is served chilled, a pleasant
experience after the burning heat of
the day. Also, to cool one off, is
Gazpachio, a chilled vegetable soup.
The town is full of little streets, lined
with narrow doorways giving a
tempting glimpse of cool courtyards
beyond. On the hill opposite the
Alhambra is the old Arab quarter,
a hill stacked with little white
houses, inhabited by people who
remind you more of their Arabic
ancestory than European.
