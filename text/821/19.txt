It is now Summer, and the farmer
who owns the circular field needs
to lengthen the rope to which the
goat is tied. To recap, the field is
twenty metres in radius, the goat
is tied to fence surrounding it.
The length of the rope was set so
that the goat could eat a quarter
of the grass in the field. The goat
has now eaten all the grass
available to it. How much longer
should the rope be, so that the
goat now has another quarter of
the field available to it?
Christmas day is drawing near, and
Father Christmas has a problem. He
has twenty more presents to deliver,
but is running out of time. He needs
to know the shortest route to take
around all twenty houses, to deliver
the presents in the quickest time.
He is sure that he can deliver the
presents before Christmas day
dawns, if only he takes the shortest
route.
The x-y coordinates of the houses
are given below. The distances
between them can be worked out
simply by pythagorus, and may be
truncated to integers. He is at the
first house in the list.
In which order should he visit the
houses so that he takes the shortest
route?
To set the scene, there is a region of
sand, and a region of rock which is
to the South. The two regions are
divided by a straight East-West line.
Now, ten miles to the South of this
dividing line lives a young man.
This young man wants to visit his
girlfriend, who lives ten miles to the
North of the dividing line, and
twenty miles West of the man's
home. The fastest method of travel
available is by camel. Now, the
camel can travel at 5mph on rock,
but only 3mph on sand. How long
does it take him to reach his
girlfriend?
