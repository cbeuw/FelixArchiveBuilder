Travel
Spain is a huge country of great
contrasts. In fact, many would claim
that it was in fact four or five
separate nations, which have always
been hard to unify under one ruler.
Wave after wave of invaders have
visited this peninsula, the Romans
and Visigoths leaving a
predominantly Christian heritage
until the Moors arrived, with the fire
of Islam in their hearts, leaving an
influence on the country hard to
reconcile in Western Europe. The
Moorish influence has left many
monuments of great beauty, and a
love for water so characteristic of a
desert people.
For many people, Spain is two
weeks on the beach toasting
themselves, getting a few beers
down in the process. Unfortunately
they miss the heart of this beautiful
country, that is still, perhaps, a bit
of a mystery to us North Europeans.
Here are a few places that catch
some of the flavour of the country.
TOLEDO
Toledo is a stunning city, caught in
a bend of the raging River Tagus.
The medieval city remains intact
behind its walls, a blend of Moorish,
Christian and Jewish architecture
untouched by time. Here Moorish
and Christian kings ruled, building
magnificent monuments to their
Gods, with Christian architects
building mosques, and then later,
Moorish architects building
churches. The Jewish influence is
also very strong, the city's two
synagogues containing fantastic,
intricately carved interiors.
A good time to wander the
narrow winding streets is late
Cathedral, Toledo
afternoon, as the sunlight still
bathes the golden buildings and
people begin to stir from their siesta
after the heat of the day. Stroll along
the walls, where El Cid once
vanquished the Moors, or hide
away in a cool, dark bar and sip at
a glass of sherry. Or, climb the
narrow streets to the top of the hill
where the cathedral stands, one of
the most beautiful in Spain, which
throngs with people at all times,
paying respects to their God.
Probably the most famous
resident of Toledo was El Greco, the
Greek. This Cretan left his home
country, came to Spain, and found
in Toledo a new home and
inspiration for his most famous
paintings. Toledo is where most of
his pictures still remain, and it is
only here that you can experience
the luminous light that is so
characteristic of his paintings.
The best place to stay in Toledo,
away from the droves of tourists, is
the youth hostel, part of a castle
facing the city proper, with
swimming pool included! And, the
night life is not at all bad; once the
coach loads of Americans have
departed, the locals come out in
force and spend the night in
numerous bars tucked away in little
alleys. I for one stayed in a bar until
6am, and even then there was no
sign of it closing.
SANTIAGO DE
C0MP0STELA
Snuggled in the rich green hills of
Galicia is the city of Santiago. The
inhabitants of Galicia, the Gallegos,
consider themselves to be a separate
race, descended from the Celts. In
fact Galicia, with its greeness and
sea airs is more reminiscent of
Brittany and Cornwall than the
burning heat of the heart of Spain.
Santiago may have been the first
tourist destination of all—in the
middle ages thousands of pilgrims
crossed Europe and Northern Spain
to see the bones of St James
(Santiago in Spanish), which were
miraculously rediscovered as the
Reconquista started. The holy relics
themselves are housed in the
magnificent Baroque cathedral, best
seen as the setting sun lights up the
golden sandstone. If you are lucky,
you may see the enormous incense
holder being swung the length of
the cathedral—it takes eight priests
to manage the thing!
Anyway, for us mere mortals not
up to a pilgrimage, a stroll through
the porticoed streets, stopping off at
a few bars for a glass of Riberio wine
straight from the cask should suffice
for an afternoon's entertainment.
For the more adventurous, try
Pulpo Gallego (octopus) or the
pimientos fried in butter (only one
in ten is hot!).
