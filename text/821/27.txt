Ex-FELIX Editor Steve Marshall expresses
his opinion on the Industrial Society in a
feature ripped out ot a 1985 FELIX
Have you noticed there is a
new and ever more
complacent type of student
at IC? Collectively they are
known as the Industrial
Society. But what is it and
what are its aims? It
postures and camouflages
ifself as a Union club but it
comes from outside and is
ultimately controlled by
those who would seek to
bulldoze students into a
career in industry before
they have had the chance
to freely reflect and form
opinions of their own about
the desirability of such a
career. And it does fhis by
clandestinely getting its
finger in the pie three years
before there's anything like
a reason to justify it. I
would like to take the
opportunity of presenting
here a few personal
opinions of such a trend,
which I see as yet another
nail in the coffin of Imperial
College and a gradual
whittling away of a free and
unprejudiced student area
in which to learn, have fun
and mould opinions and
ideas as the bedrock of any
future thought about
anything and everything.
In my time I have
digested much of the
ambience of Imperial
College and hence
formulated more than a few
views about it, and, in
particular, I have probed its
dullness to the hilt, and its
appalling sparsity of
insight. About its root
cause? A complete lack of
any kind of creatively
rebellious element on
campus. But, I feel, as ever,
that things can always be
changed and so here are
some views I should like to
disseminate amongst you.
For a start, let's face it
that the students who run
Industrial Society are a rare
breed indeed, though,
unfortuately, far from
extinct. They are people
who spontaneously
ejaculate with emotion at
the prospect of a new
foreclosure and being 'in
the know' about an exciting
new merger. But we all
know that industry is a
grind for all those but the
privilfged few who reach
the top by treading on
others.
To attempt to present
such a deathly dull
boredom as 'More
interesting than I could
have imagined' and to
glamorise it as 'a good
laugh' and lo speak of 'free
drinks on the firm' which
are provided by the theft of
decent wages for those
who work at the sharper
end of industry is both
shabbily dishonest and a
blatant shitting on the
heads of those who do the
real work in industry—the
oppressed majority.
And those students who
have recently joined, no
doubt as a result of a
certain freshers gullibility
that is only to be expected,
should be aware that they
are merely tokens in the
fradulant power games
taking place now in
universities throughout the
country. That their token
support is what will make it
increasingly difficult for the
Industrial Society to be
seen as an undesirable
intruder in an academic
environment is quite plain.
Ironically, any attempt to
remove them will be hailed
by them as a suppression
of freedom, but, at the end
of the day, Carl Burgess,
ICU President, must have
the courage of his
convictions and boot the
whole travelling circus off
campus. And there is no
need at all for him to
expend effort trying to
justify his actions fearing
crucifixion at Council and
the U G M because it is clear
thai the Industrial Society
is nothing more than an
immense and deviously
clever PR exercise as
unwelcome and
retrospectively obvious as a
smear of shit on a toilet
door. But it slinks far worse
because it is underhand
and has been slipped in
before anyone noticed what
they were up to. Its a con-
trick because you don't
realise and register
consciously what such an
influence is doing to you,
especially when you're new
to student life and frankly
lack the nous to seewhat's
happening here.
Let me list what's wrong
with it and why it has to go.
It is a restricting of ideas. It
is a cramping of university
life by its continual
reference to what happens
at the end of it as if College
itself were merely a
stepping stone — this is a
comtemptible idea and
tends to obscure the value
of a university education
and steals from those who
may choose other more
aesthetic things in life and
who turn their back on
power struggles and
seriously believe the planet
is in danger of being
reduced to a cold and
ruthless rubble of
dwindling significance
precisely because of such
shallow attitudes to life in
general, foisted upon
impressionable students
who thought they could be
free of such influences in
what is supposed to be a
society of diverse and
fascinating people. But
they're all the same and
they want everyone else to
join in and become faceless
boring, uninspiring
automatons in a big
machine they think they
grasp the consequences of,
whereas really they have
been pressurised by hard-
sell and the threat of not
getting a job in a cult
fervour which demands of
its devotees an astounding
and no doubt lucrative
reverence for the great god
Industry. In return they are
promised a job which they
could have got anyway.
And so they miss out on
university and all it has to
offer in a blinding
allegiance to complacency
and all the canker such an
attitude shovels out into
society.
But much much worse
than all of this is the fact
that it is a sprawling and
pervading debasement of
one's leisure time to feel
obliged to look to one's
masters in industry at the
end of three years. And so
— called recreation
obtained through such a
'social' society can never
be divorced from the
reason behind, why you are
there kocking back the
gratis drinks — the
premature ingratiating of
yourself with those who will
rule your lives at the end of
it just because you have let
them. It truly is a horrible
thing to have turned up to
tinker with your enjoyment
of life here at Imperial. To
arrive at college to find you
are already being
manipulated by people who
have no right to be granted
such influence over you is
a shame-faced incongruity
and its effluvia spreads
everywhere its Thatcherite
ideology. To feel obliged to
make ugly decisions about
whether membership of
such a society will improve
your chances of a job is
not what the Union is all
about and such a society
should not be granted
Union status. It is an
interloper.
Such a discouragement
of free and critical thought
by a foisting of early
committment and this
whole phenomenon of self-
seeking student barons of
industry with their rapidly
maturing obscene
wallowing greed and slimy
presumptions in disguise as
ordinary students with
genuinely sincere and
altuntic interest in the
subject of industry is the
saddest thing that has ever
crawled out of a shit-heap
and into a student
environment.
