Graduates - the

of tomorrow - have
long been regarded by
us as the key to our
future success. As a result
our reputation for professional
and practical training is unrivalled.
For the cream of this year's graduates,
Chartered Accountancy with P M M is simply
the best possible introduction to the busi-
ness world. For example it is estimated that
over a quarter of the financial directors of
the UK's top one thousand listed companies
have been P M M trained.
Even among the "Big Eight" Chartered
Accountancy practices we are unique. We
are distinguished by a departmental struct-
ure that offers exposure to all aspects of a
client's account ratherthan a narrow school-
ing in audit. You will work with clients rather
qualification.
Our size and
strength on both sides
of the Atlantic and around
the world creates a wide
range of career options in finance,
management and consultancy. Ability is the
only deciding factor and progress can be fast
moving and far reaching.
Whatever your current degree subject, if
you seek the best training for a career in
business, choose Chartered Accountancy
with PMM.
