Arthur Michael was dead. There is
no doubt whatever about that. The
register was signed by the
clergyman, the clerk, the
undertaker, and the chief mourner.
Derek signed it. And Derek's name
was good upon anything he chose
to put his hand to. Old Arthur
Michael was dead as a door-nail.
Did Derek know he was dead? Of
course he did. How could it be
otherwise? Derek and he were
partners for I don't know how many
years. Derek was his sole exrifutor,
his sole administrator, his sole
friend, and sole mourner.
Derek never painted out old
Michael's name. There it stood,
years after, above the fortress door:
Dash and Michael. The firm was
known as Dash and Michael.
Sometimes citizens new to
Cheapskate called Dash Dash,
sometimes Michael, but he
answered to both names. It was all
the same to him.
Once upon a time—of all the good
days in the year, on Christmas
Eve—Derek sat busy in the Surefield
fortress. It was cold, bleak, biting
weather: foggy as well: and he
could hear the citizens outside,
wheezing up and down, beating
their hands against their breasts,
and stamping their feet upon the
walkway to warm them. The
Cheapskate clocks had only just
gone three—or were just about to,
depending on which clock you were
looking at—but it was already dark.
Lights were burning in the
neighbouring offices, as computers
sat idly around like cherries for the
picking.
The door of Derek's office was
open that he might keep his eye
upon his secretary, John Cratchit,
who, in a dismal little cell beyond,
was copying letters. Derek had a
small fire, but the secretary's was so
very much smaller that it looked like
a single lump of coal. But he
couldn't replenish it, for Derek kept
the coal in his own office; and so
surely as the secretary came in and
tried to warm himself on the
computer, but it was gone.
'A merry Christmas!' cried a
cheerful voice. It was Derek's wife
Mad Dash, who had come upon
him so quickly that this was the first
intimation of her approach.
'Bah!', said Derek, 'Humbug!'
Mad had so heated herself at the
Christmas Caper that she was all in
a glow
'Christmas a huaibug, dear, you
don't mean that I'm sure.'
T do. Out with merry Christmas!
What's Christmas but a time for
paying bills without money, a time
for finding yourself a year older but
not an hour richer. If I had my way,
every idiot who goes round with
'Merry Christmas' on his lips would
be boiled with his own pudding,
and buried with a stake of holly
through his heart.'
'Derek!' pleaded Mad.
'Mad' returned Derek s|
'keep Christmas in your
me keep it in mine.'
Derek took his dinri
McNorthey's tavern, artcKha
read all the quality^,
home to 170.
Now, it is a fact, that there was
nothing exceptional about the
knocker on the door, except that it
was very large. As Derek
his key in the lock of the
saw in the knocker Arthur
piggy little face. To say that
not startled would be uni
paused as he opened the door, half
expecting to see Arthur's pigtail
sticking out from the other side of
the door into the hall. But there was
nothing, and Derek closed it with a
bang that resounded around the
house like thunder. He went
upstairs to his room, put on his
dressing gown, slippers and
nightcap. Then he heard a sound.
A clanking noise, as if someone
were draggiriga chain over casks in
the wine cellar. The he heard the
noise on the floors below, then
coming up the stairs. 'It's humbug
still, and I won't believe it,' said
Derek, remembering how ghosts
were described as dragging chains.
His colour changed when it walked
through the door and stood in front
of him. T know him, it's Arthur
Michael!'
'Can you sit down?' Derek asked,
looking doubtfully at him.
The ghost sat down, giving his
chains a frightful rattle.
'Why do you trouble me Arthur?'
'I. wear a chain I forged in life. I
have come to warn you that you
bear a chain heavier and longer than
this. I am here to warn you that vou
yet have a chance of escaping my
fate. You will be visited by three
clowns. You cannot hope to shun
the path I tread unless you meet
them. Expect the first tomorrow at
one.' With this the ghost left, arid
Derek instantly fell asleep.
Derek awoke. Michael's ghost had
bothered him exceedingly. WaStRd
dream? It was almost the hour for
the first clown to visit. At the
appointed time the curtains were
drawn aside and a short little man
appeared. T am the clown of
Christmas Past' said the spirit. It put
out its hand, clasped Derek by the
arm and led him froiri the house.
Derek recognised the place they
went to. It was still Cheapskate, but
it was strangely different. There
were lots of computers for a start.
~ erek to a room
, a solitary citizen,
reading a book. Derek recognised
himself as the citizen. Then some
cited
Teat party, with food
ilenty. Derek watched
self entered into the
with the rest of the
the spirit led him
i several more festive
tigs in Derek's past, before
he pleaded with the spirit to be
taken home.
Awaking again, Derek had no
need to be told that the hour was
once again upon him. He saw a
strange light in the next room, and
ventured to investigate. It was his
own room. In it stood a tall, ugly,
rugby player. T am the clown of
Christmas Present' he said.
'I went forth . last night on
compulsion' said Derek, 'Tonight,
if you have anything to teach me
then let me profit by it.'
The clown took his arm and led
him downstairs. There were people
talking, laughing and having a good
time. Derek recognised them a?
citizens at the Lumpsofmetahvors-
hippers Cocktail Party. 'Why are
they so happy?' asked Derek,
'They're so poor.'
'Well, you see' the clown replied,
'They may be poor, overdrawn and
living in run down, grotty flats,
paying extortionate rents, but they
still accept any excuse to dress up
and have a good time.'
Then the clown grasped his arm
and moved him on. He took him to
the house of Cratchits. Wendy
Cratchit was cooking the Christmas
dinner. Her two sons, Chas and Bill
were laying the table. At that
moment in came their father, John
Cratchit, with Tiny Nigel on his
shoulder. Alas for Tiny Nigel, he
had his limbs supported by an iron
frame and bore a tiny crutch. They
were a happy family, a Derek kept
lius eye on Tiny Nigel until the
clown beckoned him to leave. Derek
returend to his room and as the
clbc||i struck twelve the clown
disappeared, to be replaced by an
even more fearsome sight. A
massive woman stood before him.
T am the clown of Christmas yet to
come!' she bellowed, putting more
dread into Derek than even he
thought possible, she led him away
to the Cratchits' house. It was quiet,
very quiet. The noisy little Cratchits
were as still as statues in the corner.
In the other comer lay a tiny crutch,
no unused. 'Oh clown' begged
Derek, 'tell me it isn't so, where is
Tiny Nigel?' The spirit beckoned
Derek to the dresser, to an opened
drawer. In it there lay a bank
statement. Derek read it. 'Spirit, is
this how it will be? Tiny Nigel will
be forced to drop out because he
can't afford to study at Cheapskate?'
The spirit said nothing, but took
Derek back to his room, and left him
to sleep.
Derek scrambled out of bed. He
was so fluttered and glowing that he
ran out into the street and stopped
the first citizen he met. 'What's
today?' asked Derek. 'Why,
Christmas Day' replied the citizen.
T haven't missed it' thought
Derek, 'the clowns havd done their
work in one night. I will live in the
nast, the present and the future!'
