The Meaning of Life
Is there any scientific alternative to
the traditional conflicting ideas of
evolution and the futility of life? To
what purpose are we evolving?
How?
On Sunday December 4 a
conference discussing 'Evolution,
Science and Spirituality' was held
by the Theosophical Society at the
Institute of Complementary
Medicine.
Rupert Sheldrake, described as
'the most controversial scientist on
Earth', has spent the last ten years
considering the subject. He has
studied natural sciences at
Cambridge and philosophy at
Harvard, and holds a PhD in
biochemistry. He has contributed a
regular column to The Guardian and
written in The New Scientist, as well
as being the author of two books;
The Presence of the Past and A New
Science of Life.
According to Sheldrake eternity
and evolution are two theories often
thought to be working at cross-
purposes. Eternity describes a state
whereby the laws of nature never
change, as illustrated by physics and
chemistry. Hence the term
'discovery' when a new hypothesis
is made; it is assumed that there is
a set of static laws of nature, all of
which we will one day know.
Evolution describes a state of affairs
such that laws develop continually,
illustrated by geology and biology.
Everything is headed for a final
culmination when the ultimate
purpose or 'Omega Point' is
reached, the exact dimensions of
which have not been formulated.
Dr Sheldrake theorises that the
two interplay, and redefines them
as 'Habit and Creativity'.
Habit
This proclaims that everything
belongs to a level of organisation,
the broad categories of which are
roughly as fig 2.
fig 1
It is such that the whole system is
more than the sum of the parts. This
can be idealised as in Figure 1.
Each system has its own 'morphic
field' which perpetuates habits,
themselves altered slightly by
individuals so that they are
externally changing.
The oscillatory rhythms inherent
in all of us produce these 'morphic
fields', eg sleeping and waking,
menstrual cycles, molecular
vibrations, heartbeats, etc. Morphic
fields in effect link everything about
us together and organise the form
and shape of each system. These
morphic fields are not created by
eternal laws; they depend on the
forms of previous similar systems.

Dr Sheldrake explained that the
morphic fields contain an inherent
memory of all that has happened.
When something occurs for the first
time (due to creativity), the morphic
field causes this to occur with
increasing ease in the future,
independent of location. As an
example, he suggested that once a
particular crystal has been formed *
somewhere in the world, its
subsequent crystallisation anywhere
from the same type of components
will be easier.
The counter-argument to this has
been that fragments of the crystal
have somehow been carried from
one laboratory to the next, perhaps
in scientists' beards!
Dr Sheldrake has been testing his
idea in the Open University on the
abnormal dvelopment of fruit flies.
Once abnormal development has
occurred, it becomes easier for
subsequent fruit flies to develop
abnormally although they are not in
any way related to the fruit flies
previously tested. Experiments have
also been carried out in the UK,
USA and Australia on the ability of
unrelated rats to escape from mazes
with the same results.
Memory is not stored
in brain cells; they are
drawn from a 'cosmic
memory bank'
This theory of habit has three
major effects on former
assumptions.
1. Heredity—habits and
characteristics are carried through
morphic resonance and not genes.
2. Memory—This is influenced by
the similarity of thought pattern
occurring in the past. The most
similar pattern transmitted is usually
one's own in the past; otherwise it
could be another's thought pattern.
Memories are drawn from a 'cosmic
memory bank'. An analogy is that
your brain is like a TV set—it tunes
into fields but does not record
programmes which have passed its
screen before. Memory is not stored
in brain cells; this is backed up by
circumstantial evidence that the part
of the brain containing the memory
has not been conclusively found-
no complete removal of memory
due to the destruction of brain cells
has yet occurred. Ian Stephenson
produced some case studies
whereby children 'remembered'
things that they could not possibly
know. The usual counter-argument
to these studies is that it is either not
possible as it cannot be explained,
or that it proves reincarnation.
Morphic resonance provides a better
explanation. Telepathy, which Dr
Sheldrake claimed has happened to
just over fifty per cent of the world,
can also be explained by this theory.
However, this brings up a
question: since survival of the spirit
depends on one's memories, what
happens when we die? If the
memory is not stored in the brain,
spiritually we must survive.
3. Rituals—All societies connect
with their ancestors through rituals,
eg Thanksgiving, Passover,
Eucharist. From the theory of
morphic fields, the more similar the
ritual is carried out to the way it was
originally done, the more you can
connect with all the people who
have carried it out in the past.
Creativity
The habits theory explains regularity
in the universe—but where did this
come from? There are three different
explanations to this:
1. Throw backs or reversion:
something that has happened in the
past, stored in the morphic field,
happens again.
2. 'Evolutionary plagiarism':
something that has happened
elsewhere occurs, eg the eyes of
vertebrates and octopuses are
similar although they have
developed from different origins.
3. Influences from 'above' or
'below': from 'below' we are
considered to operate entirely due
to chance, ie we can't predict or
understand anything in the
universe, a 'materialistic' viewpoint.
From 'above' we are governed by
the Platonic Theory of Creativity, an
eternal stand consisting of latent
archetypes produced by a supreme
being.
According to Dr Sheldrake, then,
creativity is thus two-fold, as
explained in religion, eg Shiva and
Shafti (where Shiva is formative but
lacking energy; Shafti, blind
undirected energy; together they are i
creative), Yin and Yang, Spirit and
Logos, or, indeed, man and woman.
The two interact at all levels and
sustain one another.
The Theosophical Society—
Theosophy is defined as 'Divine
Wisdom' and represents the
'knowledge of truth'. Its
fundamental principles are the unity
of all, the universality of law and
evolution. The address of the
Society is:
