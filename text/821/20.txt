Alice was wandering through the
forest when ,suddenly, she heard a
voice behind her:
'Hello. Would you care for a cup
of tea?'
She turned round and the most
, peculiar sight met her eyes. There,
in a clearing, stood a long wooden
table and around it sat three of the
strangest creatures she ever had
seen. The voice spoke again.
T asked if you would like a cup of
tea?'
It belonged to a very curious
looking man with a long cloak and
a very silly hat. Alice remembered
her manners
'Thank you very much', she
replied courteously.
'Well, you can't, we haven't any'
'Then why did you ask me if I
wanted some?' Alice retorted.
'Well, you see, I am completely
mad. Mad as a hatter. Indeed I am
a Mad-Hatter: Bill Madhatter at your
service'
Another voice rang out from the
other side of the table.
'He's not really a hatter', cried a
rabbit-like creature with a mass of
spiky hair, 'He used to run a
newspaper, until he annoyed the
King of Heartless.'
'Goodness Gracious! What did
the King do'
'It was terrible. He cut off his Print
Unit. Would you like a cup of tea?'
'But you have no tea?'
'Of course not, but its only polite
to ask. Anyway, I am also
completely mad. I'm Ian, the Mad
March Haircut and this is Chas, the
Dormouse,'
And with that, he hit the small,
furry, snoring creature sitting next
to him. It woke up with a start.
'What! Er, yes, er, no, of course
I wasn't asleep. I never sleep. Good
Heavens! who might you be?'
'I'm Alice,' said Alice.
T would offer you a cup of tea, but
I'm afraid I'm sitting in the teapot'
Alice looked, and indeed he was.
'Hello. Let me introduce myself.
I am the Dormouse. Being a
dormouse is •very interesting. Its
very interesting being a dormouse.
You do all kinds of interesting
things and meet all kinds of
interesting people. Yes, its very
interesting being a dorm.... Zzzzz'
He fell asieep without finishing
his sentenc vhich Alice thought
was rather rude.
'Oh. Don't worry about him.' The
hatter spoke. 'He's bored himself to
sleep. He often does this. The truth
is he's slightly Muesli'
'Muesli?' inquired Alice.
ill
'Did I say Muesli. I'm most
dreadfully sorry, but, as you know,
I'm as mad as a hatter.'
At that very moment, they heard
a trumpet call. The dormouse woke
up with a start and hid in the teapot.
'Quick!' shouted the hatter 'Stand
up! Sit down! Kneel! Pray!! It's the
King.'
'Curiouser and curiouser,'
thought Alice. At that very moment
the royal party thundered into the
clearing, waving flamingos. The
March Haircut bowed low.
'Your Gracious Majesties,' he
grovelled, 'May this humble servant
introduce you to Alice.'
Alice had always been taught to
be polite.
'I'm very pleased to meet you,'
she said, and curtsied.
'We should think so too. We are
Nigel, the King of Heartless, and
this is Fiona, the Queen'
'Money!' the Queen spat out.
'Give me money, money. Money
for blind people, ill people, children,
animals, RAG!'
She waved a can under Alice's
nose. This was rather rude, Alice
thought, although she didn't say so
out loud. That would be even ruder.
'Later Fiona, Later,' the King
interrupted, 'We wish to converse.'
He smiled sincerely, straightened
his crown and handed Alice a piece
of paper.
'We wish you to fill in the royal
questionnaire.'
Alice looked at the piece of paper.
It was full of the most peculiar
questions.
'Your Majesty!' exclaimed Alice,
quite forgetting her manners, "This
is complete and utter nonsense'
Everyone went quiet. The
Dormouse shivered inside his
teapot. The Mad Hatter hid under
his silly cloak. The King went
purple.
'Off with her head! Off with her
head' he screamed.
Alice stayed calm.
'You cannot do that,' she retorted,
'Its not allowed'
'We can do as we want.' and the
King pulled out from under his
robes a large blue book.
"This is the book of all the rules of
Wonderland'. He waved it
triumphally in the air.
'Rule 41 clearly says that the King|
is allowed to interpret the rules
when the rules do not make sense'
'B-B-But,' squeaked a tiny voice
from inside the teapot, 'who decides!
if the rules make sense or not'
'We do, of course,' spat the King,
'and we are rewriting all the rules
so that none of them make sense.
This will make me the most'
powerful person in Wonderland'.'
He was giggling manically and'
pointing at the teapot.)
'Off with his spout' he cried.
The Royal Guards advanced on;
Alice. "This is very silly' she thought!
and, saying goodbye as politely as j
she could under the circumstances,
she started to run into the forest as
fast as her legs would carry her. She I
ran for miles and miles. She ran
until her legs ached and she had to ]
rest down under a gigantic
mushroom.
. She remembered this place: it was
where she had first met the
caterpillar on her first visit to
Wonderland. Strangely enough,
there was no sign of the caterpillar
now. All that was left now was a:
pile of paper plates and an uneaten j
bowl of chilli. 'Where could he have i
gone' she asked herself.
However, she did not have time to [
find an answer, the royal guards:
were hard on her heals. They were-
gaining on her every second. They-
were almost upon her...
Alice woke up with a start.
'Goodness Me,' she said to.;
herself, 'that must all have been the-i
most dreadful dream. Such a!
peculiar mixed up place couldn't.,
possibly exist in reality, could it?'...j
Ents
To end off the term, on Wednesday
December 14, Ents are putting on a
Christmas Party in association with
The Institut Francais (the French
secretarial school just down by
South Ken tube station). It starts at
8pm, featuring a disco, bar
extension, the works and perhaps
even some mince pies for the first
groups of people in. Tickets are
available from the Union Office (£1
adv, £1.50 on the door, or free with
an Ents card).
Also a quick note to tell you that
when you do come back to College
next term, there's a Carnival on
Friday January 13 to welcome you
home. The whole of the Union
Building is being used, with bands,
discos, comedy, theatre, casino,
films, food and very late bar
extensions (imagine Freshers' Week
crammed into one night!); look out
for details at the start of the new
term.
But what of the events that have
gone on this term. Freshers' Week
was a resounding success, despite
the chaos caused by the postal strike
The New Years Party started off the
year, my particular favourites on the
night being The Muscle Shoal, but
also with excellent entertainment
from from The Company She Keeps
and Boys Wonder. The comedy night
was a storming evening, packed to
capacity and with Mark Thomas in
definitely the best form I've seen
him in. Finally, to end the week,
The Freshers' Ball. The Chevalier
Brothers (now sadly demised)
topped the night, supported with
dance sounds from African band
Taxi Pata Pata, and homegrown
band Dave, Puppy and the Happy Dogs
and not forgetting the flurry of
discos, films and drinking that also
went on all night.
The Silwood Bonfire Party was a
hearty evening. After the bonfire
and fireworks, and numbing
coldness, everybody went indoors
to warm up and more importantly
to see the Virginia Vagabounds, who's
unique style of foot-stomping
country and western sent all of the
crowd into a frenzy (we were in no
way responsible for the other band
that evening).
Finally, as a warm up to
Christmas, The jets played last week,
probably the funniest and liveliest
band I've seen in College.
All that's left for me to do is
remind you not to forget enjoying
yourself next term and to say a huge
word of thanks to everyone who
helped out this year.
Cheers, Paul Watkiss.
