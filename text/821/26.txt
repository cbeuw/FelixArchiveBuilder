Ways Out of the Arms Race:
Solutions to a Problem
'Ways out of the arms race?'
The man stared nervously at the
unblinking video camera.
'I've really no idea.' He recently
won a Nobel prize, and was still not
used to persistent reporters. 'Thats
why I'm here as a matter of fact.'
This answer was typical of about
half the people asked at our recent
International Scientists' Congress
held here at Imperial College. The
other half were people from
weapons labs, from universities,
defence organisations, from think
tanks, peace groups and Research
Institutes who are often specialised
in explaining why their own
specialty is the Way Out. So
Strategic Defence Initiative (SDI)
advocates (addmittedly thin on the
ground these days) would claim that
the way forward is to build 100%
effective defenses, then with
missiles obsolete and impotent, get
rid of them. Arms control experts
would claim that you need treaties,
you can verify them, and build in
stability in arms reductions. Some
peace groups would unilaterally
renounce the need for nuclear arms,
and then hope that what used to be
called the Evil Empire would do the
same.
Of course, these days, it's all
pretty much a state of flux, what
â€¢with President Gorbachev's
'Christmas Present' - the heralding
of a 'New Era' - as our national
the demos were
organised by
two Nobel Prize
winners
press breathlessly put it. But the
three examples of 'Ways Out of the
Arms Race' given above delineate
the range of views held by most
people, and most people who came
to our Congress.
What characterises all three ideas
is the need for an assessment on
how smart they really are as plans.
So if one could prove scientifically
that SDI will not work because of
O-level physics reasons, then you
could safely ignore the SDI
advocates (maybe looking for their
vested interests in being advocates)
and seek your solution to the arms
race elsewhere. If one could prove
that verification of a Comprehensive
Test Ban would not be possible,
perhaps for geophysical reasons,
then one could discount the second
option. The third option is rather
more difficult, since one is dealing
with people rather than physics.
However it is worth exploring, and
it is here that scientists have a major
role to play.
In our conference we had Robert
McNamara and Richard Garwin
debunking the Star Wars mythology
with a mixture of their hard - nosed
pragmatism and O-level physics.
Josie Stein described the dirty deeds
of Star Wars advocates, who
suppressed contrary experimental
evidence, and told lies to their
funding agencies. To balance these
three Americans we had Secretary
General Gorbachev's space and
policy advisor Roald Sagdeev tell us
of the likely Soviet response to a
continuing SDI implementation. It
is quite clear that in SDI, as in all
forms of warfare, one has to take the
opponent into account. We had
thirty other experts talking about
their specialties: the role of British
and French weapons, the
verification of treaties, the arms race
at sea, the arms race and sexuality, -
conventional force reductions,
models of stability. We had forty
posters on weapons and war
research.
The announced Soviet force
reductions were hinted at by many
of our speakers from the Eastern
bloc, who also predicted progress in
chemical weapon treaty-making
soon. We had speakers discuss
other technological developments
which should interest us all: K. -
Subramanyam argued his case that
developed countries, in seeking to
limit developing countries from
acquiring the bomb, were being
more than slightly hypocritical if
also continuing to proliferate new
technologies. Our talks did not
avoid controversy: Subramanyam
had to justify his government's
nuclear position to understandably
concerned Pakistanis in the
audience. A letter was sent to
Benazir Bhutto congratulating her
decision to scrap Pakistan's nuclear
weapon program, if or when she
finds that it exists.
We had a demonstration to the
Iraqi Embassy, protesting their
proven use of horrific chemical
weapons against Kurds. We had
another to the Israeli Embassy,
protesting their imprisonment of
Mordechai Vanunu, who revealed
the 'secrets' of the Israeli nuclear
arsenal to the Sunday Times. We
even had our own police escort, but
then the demos were organised by
two Nobel prize winners.
It was an extraordinairy time for
a Congress, given Gorbachev's
initiatives, developments in new
armaments, and the extraordinairy
changes in the nature and public
perception of the threat. The
primary aim was not to attract press:
let's be honest, 550 scientists sitting
around talking is not intrinsically
news-worthy. However, we had
about 100 press organisations and
individuals come. We had ten
television companies taking film.
More important is the mood of those
participants. Whether they work in
the field of arms control, or were
just interested bystanders, they
went away from Imperial College
feeling refreshed, revitalised having
learnt new things and made many
contacts. They had had their ideas
challenged, and maybe even had
new ones. Congress telephones
have not stoppedringing:the MOD
asking how many of 'their people'
went: Novosti, AP, TASS and UPI
wanting a speech from somebody
who built bombs.
Many people helped this
Congress, and they deserve our
thanks. Bill Goodwin crawled out of
bed at the ghastly hour of 10 am to
help us copy speeches for a
clamouring world press.
Ian Morris and Nigel Baker helped
us to set up our exhibition of arms
control posters in the JCR. We had
enthusiastic and vital help from
Tariq Ali, Michelle Clarke, Sarah
Conyers, Ian Cormack, Rebecca
Cowley, Clare Davis, Rachel
Dowling, James Durrant, Gordon
Edge, Ina El-Kadhi, Frank
Federman, Natalia Karapanagioti,
Martin Kinsey, Sam Lee, Zahid
Malik, Thomas Manzocchi, Gregory
Markonizos, David Marshall,
George Mitsioulis, Christine Mollet,
Joachim Muller, Rakes Muthoo,
Vicky Phillips, Mike Plummer,
Farzana Saeed, Gunter Siddiqi,
Naeem Siddiqi, Peter Sidley, Lara
Sherwin, Chris Veal, Hans
Viehmann and Angeles Vorvolakos.
One important thing seems to be
that East and West are talking to
each other increasingly and over an
ever-widening range of issues.
Perhaps a more important thing is
that North and South are beginning
to do the same: the tensions caused
by the inequalities in the Developed
and Developing Worlds are more
and more being seen as the primary
causes of the many wars since the
Second World War, since nuclear
weapons began keeping the peace.
The aims of the Congress continue,
and indeed are sharpened by the
the MoD asking
how many of 'their
people' went
developments of this week. The
Third International Congress is
already germinating.
Ways Out of the Arms Race? At
our Congress, we did not
necessarily provide any single
solution, but we hope that maybe it
was part of a solution.
