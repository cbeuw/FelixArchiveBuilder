Music
On Christmas
Christmas, a time for kindness,
goodwill and peaceful
contemplation of religious matters,
when people renew acquaintances
and celebrate the birth of our Lord.
Crap! Christmas is the season when
western society nose dives into a pit
of opportunist commercialism. It is
an economic anomoly where
everyone goes apeshit about
shopping ('Nightmare on Oxford
Street'), when big business pushes
Elvis, Santa's Nephew.
products on consumers when their
defences are down. This is the time
when our seasonal companies
emerge, like Brig-o-Doon they
appear magically once a year. For
instance, have you ever seen a
Ronco advert between January 5th
and December 1st? Ronco only exist
for one month a year, in which time
they sell all their 'useful' items such
as 'Map-o-Meter' or 'Handy Finger
Nail Counter', next year I am
reliably infomed they are bringing
'out a Christ decrucifier. MB games
are another yuletide -rianufacturer,
producing 'Buckan or 'Twizzler',
games which remans in the shops
until the next Christmas. And then
we come to the seasonal music
scene and that great British
institution K-Tel records. Why not
buy your lo\ t d one a boxed set of
slushy songs done by relatives of the
original artist's neighbour? Who
listens to 'Christmas Songs' by Val
Doonican aside from Doonican
himself (how many log fires has that
man got?)?
Outside the fantasy world of K-Tel
the usual music monster mutates
itself in an attempt to emulate K-Tel.
Slade return again, on crutches, to
once again sing 'Merry Christmas'
again and wave their scarves again
what do they gain? Is this their only
function on this planet? Yes. What
is the forum for Slade, what is the
medium by which they can bid us
good tidings so frequently? 'Top of
the bloody merry Yuletide Pops
that is the twisted creature that is to
blame. Throughout the year it is a
bad programme, filled with
nauseating rent-a-smiles and inane
pseudo-celebrities watching the
latest puppets mime to a pre-
produced lump of sonic Mills and
Boon dolly mixture, but it is not
disturbing, so it does not bother you
because you can switch it off
(though now you must not listen to
the radio either). However, at
Christmas Top of the Pops pervades
all space, it becomes a grotesque
parody of itself and you cannot
escape from it, it appears to be on
all channels at all times. When you
turn the telly on to watch Blue
Peter's Chrissy party, where they
show you how to build an
authentic-looking advent utensil
using a Mini Metro and non-
flammable tinsel, you find yourself
seeing Jimmy Saville's tobacco-
'Streetcred' Springsteins rendition
of 'Santa Claus is Coming to Town'.
Commercialism in music? No, these
serious artists are singing about
what they believe in. Festive TOTP
also includes the statutory 'White
Christmas' by Bing (is he Val
Doonican's dad? they have the same
log fire) Crosby, the annual David
Essex emetic dirge and the random
'nice' song that gets to the top of the
tinsel-covered charts.
Perhaps the only thing on TV
more obtrusive than Top of the Pops
at Christmas are the ghosts of
Christmas past; that is, the four
films which always push their way
onto the viewing lists in late
December, 'The King and [' with
Duncan Goodhew in glorious
technicolour, 'The Wizard of Oz'
starring Toto in even more glorious
technicolour, a hairy-chested Bond
film and some weak adaptation of
Charles Dickhead's 'A Christmas
Carol'.
Speaking of Christmas carols,
don't . They are the epitome of all
that is bad about Christmas, and so
they should be since they broadcast
the whole sordid affair. Everyone
pretends to enjoy them and
pretends not to loathe carol singers
who come around during the
'Morcombe and Wise Yuletide fun
jape programme', all singing the
popular harmonies and none
singing the original tune. Songs
mutate with each successive
Christmas. The chief collaborators of
carol singers are the brass bands
who busk in awkward places and
'parp' their way through your least
favourite songs (which you have on
John Belushi gets into the festive spirit.
An elf.
the K-Tel Val Doonican log fire
ensemble from last year anyway).
This season has a strange mass-
brainwashing effect, people actually
start to like pantomime. The most
repulsive of all Victorian products.
How can someone tell themselves
that the chirpy cockney Jim
Davidson's transvestite panto is
entertaining? Good old right wing,
racist, rich Jim Davidson makes a
few bob and a tanner for Christmas
by dressing up in garish bloomers
and making people vomit—what an
entrepreneur. Big brothers must be
lacing the syrupy sherry and mince
pies with some standard-destroying
drug.
Of course some people enjoy the
Christmas period. Chaps can get
together, get drunk and shout their
own version of those festive greats.
It is simple to substitute rude words
for the religious ones and end up
with a liver-splittingly funny song
to spill your drink to.
It is impossible to escape from
Christmas music because all the
audible media feel it obligatory to
play as much as possible—even the
mighty John Peel succumbs to
compiling a festive fifty, and all
other Radio One DJ's become
Christmas machines.
No one ever says anything against
this time of year, it is above criticism
because it is Christmas. Still people
buy stylophones and socks for
people who don't want them and
who buy them a decrucifier and
Buckeroo in return. Still shops put
out hideous ribbon-dominated
displays in their windows which are
cornered with spray-on fake snow
(caustic over-cleaner) and every year
it gets worse.
An outsider might see it as
punishing ourselves around the
time of the great annual turkey-cull.
Jesus and St Nicholas have a lot to
answer for.
