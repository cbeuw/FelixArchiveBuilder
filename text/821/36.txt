News Review...News Review....News Review...
If one is to use the benefit of
hindsight to review the news from
the last ten issues of FELIX, what
becomes apparent from the eighty
or so items is that accommodation
and top-up loans occur most
frequently. The same would be true
for any college this term and will
surprise few people, however
FELIX continued to report other
relevant issues such as collapsing
ceilings, computer thefts, merger
negotiations and the demise of
Norman the Rat. Does anything
ever change at Imperial?
The most important story of the
term started, when Kenneth Baker
visited the College in late October
for informal discussions with the
Rector, Professor Ash and with t
'chosen few' students. The visit was
not publicised and remained a low-
key affair, but Mr Baker revealed his
intentions to introduce top-up loans
Kenneth Baker's
loans
in a White Paper. He was
questioned on the plans for
Community Charge and replied that
students would receive an 80%
rebate against the actual charge that
is paid when the system is
introduced in 1990. He also
admitted it would also lead to a
'disentitlement to benefit' but added
that the generous terms of the loans
would compensate for the loss.
The 'education debate' as it
became known in the media, was
working up to fever pitich, with
contraversial statements by Lord
Chilver adding fuel to the fire. Lord
Chilver became chairman of the
Universities Funding Council
(UFC), the body which replaced the
UGC, and is vice-chancellor of
Cranfield Institute of Technology.
An interview with The Times Higher
Education Supplement reported that
he believed the principle on which
eligibility to enter higher education
is governed should be 'the student's
willingness to commit his or her
own resources to gaining that
education'.
The second week of November
saw the publication of the now
infamous White Paper on 'Top Up
Loans.' The full story was reported
in FELIX within one day of its
publication.
The report bases a student's
requirements on a national income
survey and allocates £1179 for rent
in London—equivalent to £30 in 39
weeks. Imperial students in 1990
will borrow £460 per year (£340 in
their final year) and will no longer
be entitled to housing benefit.
This daunting prospect caused
fifteen thousand students (including
nearly 30 from IC) to assemble on
Westminster Bridge to demonstrate.
Violent scenes were widely reported
as the demonstration deteriorated
into a pitiched battle. Students'
Unions blamed confrontational
tactics of the Socialist Workers Party
students and he,avy-handed
policing.
The student loans debate
continues at IC—an extraordinary
meeting of the Union last Thursday
agreed to protest with a College-
wide ballot and petition.
Students may well be short of
money after 1990 but will feel lucky
if they have a roof over their heads.
Accommodation problems have
jeen reported almost every week in
FELIX.
The Freshers' issue recorded the
merger of Mining and Southwell
Houses in Evelyn Gardens, the new
hall is still named Southwell as
plans to call it 'Monk Hall' were
dropped. The College gambled £1.6
million buying 'Olave House' from
the Girl Guide Association. Most of
the money for this purchase comes
from a loan, the repayments for
which would require rents of £100
per week for each room. The
College can only charge, a more
realistic, £55 per week and Mr John
Smith is hoping mortgage interest
rates decrease soon. Hamlet
£1.6 million
speculation
Gardens was damaged by squatters
again last summer, this time causing
several thousand pounds worth of
damage. The infamous Bernard
Sunley House received a £530,000
upgrade of three of the five houses
bringing it in line with local
authority requirements.
The College reconsidered damage
charges made against former
occupants of Lexham Gardens. The
Head Tenancies were returned to
their landlord with £8,362 in
damage charges.
A rent strike was looming in mid-
October after Fisher Hall residents
claimed they had been misled over
the rents, followed by Beit Hall
residents also angry at the College's
decision to charge a week's rent for
the Christmas vacation. Union
Honorary Secretary, Ian Morris,'-':
proposed a motion in late October
to the College Governing Body that
rents should be subsidised from
funds from overseas students.
This proposal was later echoed by
College Secretary John Smith,
arguing for a transfer of funds from
academic to the residence accounts.
He produced a paper suggesting
that money from overseas students'
fees could be used but realised it
may meet opposition since they are
not always guaranteed a place in
Hall.
Ceilings have collapsed twice in
Evelyn Gardens this term,
fortunately not injuring any of the
room's inhabitants. Managing
Surveyor of Residences, Peter
Hallworth, claimed it was the result
of dampness caused by students
filling baths to the rim before getting
in. He also stated that students were
in no danger despite the three
collapses in the last two years.
Montpelier Hall and 170
Queensgate were up for sale this
term, the latter, however, the result
of a QT Society spoof

ceilings
advertisement. Montpelier, which
requires a £230,000 upgrade, failed
to receive any bids in the £5 million
region, which could enable the
College to purchase a suitable
alternative hall and sale plans were
scrapped.
On October 19th College officially
merged with St Mary's Hospital
Medical School at a ceremony
attended by HRH the Princess
Royal. In the same week it was
announced talks had begun on a
merger with the Royal Holloway
and Bedford New College. Plans for
the merger suggest the
accommodation problems could be
solved since undergraduates would
live at the RHBNC site of Egham in
Surrey. Professor Ash is also known
to be keen on a strong arts and
humanities department for IC. The
Universities Funding Council
agreed. to fund such a merger
between RHBNC and IC fueling
speoulation that it is likely to go
ahead. Royal Holloway and Bedford
New College have received publicity
after their Governing Council
proposed to sell their Holloway
picture collection. The College faces
insolvency in 1990.
It's not all doom and gloom for
students though. Rag Week has
raised over £7,500 but without Chas
Brereton's piano marathon during
which £1,500 was collected for
charity last year the figure is less
than before. Tiddly Winks down
Oxford Street in Freshers' Week
raised £2698. The Rag Mag has
finally been produced under the
editorship of David Williams though
not without problems from the
Censorship Committee who found
some of the jokes distasteful.

The College continued suffering
from a spate of computer thefts
which are believed to have cost
insurers about £150,000. The Rec-
tor's computer, worth £6,000 was
stolen from his Electrical
Engineering office over the sum-
mer and since then thefts have oc-
cured in Mechanical Engineering
and the School of Management.
College Security believe the
thieves have access to pass keys
and may include a member of
staff.
The Main Dining Hall received
a refurbishment costing £300,000
and made a loss of £22,000 in the
last financial year. In the year
1986-87 a gross trading profit of
£73000 was made. FELIX reported
that changes made to the lighting
plans by the Rector's wife push-
ed the cost up by £30,000. Mr Rob
Northey's empire was also
featured in the news pages when
it transpired that sales of salads by
weight, in The Gardens, was il-
legal. The Union Snack Bar, also
famous for its loss making ac-
tivities, received a refit costing
£40000 and the attention of
management consultants.
The Debating Society held the
most contentious meetings this
term with speakers on the subject
of 'A Future for South Africa'.
Enoch Powell,the former MP
spoke to the H G Wells Society on
the subject of 'Textural Criticism
of the Old Testament'. Mr Powell
is also famous for his political
views.
Finally, there were red faces all
round in Mechanical Enginering
where ,a giant candle is being
built for charity. Firstly the wick
was dropped to the bottom of the
10m mould, and now it appears
an error must have been made in
the heat transfer calculations, as
the candle may not solidify in
time for the lighting ceremony in
Hyde Park!
FELIX staff would like to wish
you all a Happy Christmas.
