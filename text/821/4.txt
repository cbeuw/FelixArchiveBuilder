Dear Bill,
Here's a note for your bumper
Christmas edition which you may
find time to read, that is if Liz
Warren lets you come up for air. It's
good to see that at least two
students will be warm during these
long, .dark winter nights. After all,
'tis the season to be jolly, though at
IC one has to be very jolly indeed
for the whopping 19-day 'holiday.'
Christmas might pass by completely
unnoticed if the break was any
shorter. Several people have
thought of an alternative to holidays
- sabbatical. This wonderful
institution, taking its name from the I
hebrew word 'shabath', to rest,1
gives people an opportunity to
sharpen pencils (Deputy President
Chas Brereton), bonk nurses
(Honarary Secretary Wendy
Morris), or wear cheap suits and do
nothing (Union President Nigel
Baker).
In order to qualify one has to win
votes, and here are some tips on
how to gain Sab Cred:
1. The Steph Snell Approach:
Chain yourself to the microphone at
UGM's. This is similar to Suffragette
tactics, and every bit as annoying.
2. The Dream Ticket Approach :
Team up with some bona fide hacks
(The Cosmic Ferret, Dave Williams
... shurley shome mistake - Ed ...
etc.) This should have the opposite
effect to Dan Quayle.
3. The Literate Approach : Write
at least two letters per week to Felix.
This is the method preferred by
Frank Leppington, head of the
Maths Department. Unfortunately
Frank does not qualify for a
sabbatical, but this does not stop
him writing a lot of letters.
One person who has already
earned his Sabbatical Holiday
Package is now aspiring to greater
glory. He means to become ULU
president, although his wardrobe is
by Marks and Spencer and he;
doesn't give a toss about anything.
Personally I don't think Nigel Baker
will make it. His last name is a
complete non-starter, and his fear of
getting his suit damaged during
protests (viz. Westminster Bridge)
seems to throw his manhood into
question.
In matters of fashion one has to
admire Wendy Morris, my adopted
father. His dress sense is impeccable
- nowadays that is. On taking a trip
through a worm-hole in space-time
to Wendy's past I found quite a
different state of affairs. He was a
sorry sight - greasy hair, flares, Doc
Martins and volcanic acne. A nurse
wouldn't have looked twice at him.
Plus ca change, plus c'est la raeme
chose...
It is mysterious that £22000 should
have gone missing from the
refectory. Even more mysterious is
the appearance of a red Porsche 924
(with electric sun-roof) in the garage
of Mr Northey. These facts may be
unrelated, but I suspect that they are
not. You see, I recently materialized
in Mr Northey's skirting board
while he was doing some 'creative
accounting.'
'Hmmm...£73,000 profit last year.
The Porsche is £30,000, electric sun-
roof £5,000, leather upholstery
£2000, a garage in Kensington
£10000 and ten bottles of Bollinger
to celebrate - that's £47000. I'll
account for it by a clever mixture of
salary rises and rising costs, not that
anyone will read it anyway. Except
for the committee, and they can
have 4000 each. They'll know
nothing, they'll see nothing.'
One of my favourite hangouts is
the HUBby office. For a start they
leave tasty morsels of cake and ice
cream on the floor. Eric's always
there.
'Can I have some more cake
please?'
'When I say so, Eric. Don't forget
who wears the trousers around
here.'
'Then can we have another party
with lots of ice-cream and cake and
a magician who pulls a floppy white
bunny out of a hat?
'Shut up,' she said dominantly
and stuffed some more cake into
Eric's mouth. Then she cracked her
whip and sat down to write another
tome for Felix about her trousers
and her HUBby office.
I see that one of Union President's
Nigel Baker's favourite haunts is the
Piano Wire in Soho. After a hard
day doing nothing, he carefully
takes off his Marks and Spencer
suit, dons his fish-nets, high heels
and lacy panties to swanker over to
'The Club.' He might not be King
of ULU, but he makes araceQueen.
By the way, Nigel, Butch sends her
love and so do I,
Love,
Norman (The Ex-Union Rat).
Photo glove story
One day Wendy and Nigel were in the snack
bar, burbling happily. 'Eeek,' said Wendy.
All of a sudden, in walked Chas. Chas was
jealous. 'Eeek,' moaned Wendy.
'You bounder,' cried Chas, 'Wendy is mine,
keep your hand off her.' 'Eeek,' screamed
Wendy.
'I challenge you to a duel,' said Nigel. 'You!
cad,' said Chas, through pouting lips. 'Eeek/
said Wendy.
And so Nigel challenged Chas to eat a
croissant at dawn. 'Eeek' said Wendy.
As luck would have it Chas choked on a
caterpillar. Nigel and Wendy, on the other
hand, had a lousy weekend in Bognor.
'Eeek,' said the croissant.
