'They'll have to drag me kicking and screaming from my office'
Tears of frustration as ULU
President 'no-con' bid fails
Stuart Jackson, President of the
University of London Union (ULU)
was almost no-confidenced last
week at a highly emotional Union
General Meeting which saw many
council members in tears. The
events of the meeting were
described by a spokesman from
ULU as 'dramatically disturbing to
the general position of the Union'.
An initial motion of censure,
which labelled Mr Jackson as
'incompetent', was proposed by
Simon Aldis, co-President of the
School of Oriental and African
Studies Union (SOAS) and was
passed convincingly. A subsequent
ammendment, proposed by Chris
Massey, the Senator for Medicine to
the GUC, proposed a 'no-
confidencing' of Mr Jackson.
Mr Massey, discharged himself
from hospital where he was
receiving treatment for a painful
tendon injury, to be at the meeting.
When his motion failed by a margin
of 2%, he resigned in tears,
believing this to be the honorable
line of action.
The motion came after weeks of
disquiet among executive committee
members, who claimed to be 'totally
outraged over Stuart Jackson's lack
of action', particularly with respect
to the march over student loans, his
disregard for his Vice-President's,
and his failure to provide briefings
for members of the Executive,
Senate and other representatives,
on the meetings they were to
attend.
Fears about his inadequacy came
to a head at the NUS conference,
when Mr Jackson arrived four hours
later than the other members of the
Exec, and proceeded to listen to his
personal stereo for the remaining
time.
In the 'no-confidence' motion
which followed there were 56 votes
in favour, 32 against and 1
abstention. In order for a President
to be ousted a two-thirds majority
in favour of the motion is required.
The motion failed by two votes, the
required figure being 58.
The narrow margin in the voting
has prompted a call for Mr Jackson
to resign from a number of colleges,
mcludrng SOAS, King's, LSE, UCL,
The London School of Pharmacy
and St George's Medical School.
A number of representatives from
Imperial voted against the motion,
and Mr Jackson has written to Nigel
Baker, ICU President, to thank him
for his support.
Mr Jackson told FELIX he thought
the motion was a 'personal
conspiracy' against him. He said
that the Exec's accusations oi
inadequacy were 'a smoke screen
for political and personal
differences'. He said their
'mouthing, banal left-wing
statements' would not prevent him
from continuing in office as 'one of
the few conservatives who has
made an effort to work with
students who follow robotic, left-
wing violence.'
He claimed that although the
Students' Union is against him, he
has 'a large amount of respect from
the University itself. T will not
leave,' he concluded, 'they'll have
to drag me kicking and screeming
out of my office.
Executive members and
representatives of a number of
student unions in ULU remain
pessimistic about the remainder of
his time in office. A spokesman for
SOAS told FELIX, 'his disregard for
public relations and his ceaseless
ability to open his mouth before he
thinks, will lead to trouble'. They
hope to remove some of Mr
Jackson's responsibilities from him
and claim that, if no change is seen,
they will attempt a no-confidence
motion again, possibly in the near
future.
ICU vote for action on
Student Loans
A motion calling for the Union
Executive to present a petition
against student loans to MP's at a
Parliamentary lobby on January 19
was passed at Thursday's
Emergency Gene: meting. The
motion also called foi .he Union to
organise a half day strike, subject to
departmental ballots, which would
enable students to attend the lobby
and to regularly liaise with the
National Uni if Students (NUS).
Under the motion, the IC Union
President, Nigel Baker, has been
' mandated to write to the Secretary
. of State for Education explaining the
. reasons for the action taken by IC .
Union.
Speaking in favour of the motion,
proposer Julian Moore said that the
introduction of Student Loans was
an admission by the Government
that student grants were too low.
He added that the loss of benefits
which will accompany the
introduction of loans will cost
students £1000 a year, according to
NUS figures.
A second motion, suggesting that
London students should receive an
extra £270 in the final year and £360
in other years was also discussed
_ passed. The motion also,
suggested iiu-: .-. system of housing
support should be established to
compensate for the loss of housing
benefit in London, and stated that
the Union 'does not, in any way
endorse the principle of Student
Loans.'
Under the terms of the motion,
the President is mandated to discuss
these issues at the Governing Body
and to ask the Governers for their
support.
The Union hope to be able to
arrange an open debate between a
number of MP's on the Loans Issue
rt the start of next term.
Finance
forces quick
merger
decision
The proposed merger of IC with
Royal Holloway and Bedford New
College (RHBNC) now looks more
likely to go ahead, following a
review of their Chemistry
Department.
The review was carried out ir
response to a recent report by the
University Grants Committee
(UGC). It concluded that the
Department would in no way satisfy
the size criteria recommended in the
UGC report even if its staff and
student levels were to reach the
optimistic targets set by the College.
In order to avoid closure, the
Department's only viable line of
action lies in a merger with IC,
according to the Head of Chemistry
at RHBNC. Staff at Royal Holloway
claim that such an event would lead
to Chemistry students from IC being
transferred to RHBNC, thus
swelling their department.
RHBNC face increasing problems
with their plans to raise the money
necessary to implement a merger. If
they are able to sell the land they
own on the opposite side of the A30
they will no longer have the room
necessary to house IC students. As
this is the main advantage of a
merger to IC, it seems the land will
have to be retained.
The RHBNC Council also
intended to raise a large sum of
money from the sale of their world-
famous picture collection, but the
handling of dicussions about such
a sale resulted in a large amount of
harmful press exposure. As a result
the possible sale of certain pictures
has had to be postponed until
March next year, at the earliest, to
allow public interest to quieten.
The main buildings of RHBNC are
presently undergoing a large
structural survey, the result of
which is likely to demand expensive
building. They are also in the
process of building a new library to
replace the present 'portacabin'
housing. This project alone is
expected to cost £2.9 million at
January 1988 prices. The elusive
working party is reported to have
already drafted an initial report on
the possibility of a merger, but has
officially postponed its release date
to the end of January. RHBNC
Council have, however, announced
that a decision whether to merge
should definitely be made by the
end of the academic year.
