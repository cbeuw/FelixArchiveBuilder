Again!
Last weekend were the two most
important days in the diaries of Judo
plavers in universities, colleges and
polytechnics all over Great Britain—
the 1988-89 British Students Judo
Championships, incorporating the
British Universities Championships
and the British Colleges and
Polytechnics Championships.
186 of the best Judo players from
49 universities, colleges and
polytechnics gathered to Crystal
Palace National Sports Centre on
December 3 and 4 amongst these,
representing University of London,
were four Imperial College players;
Pete Swettenham, Dave Buttles,
Jonathan Lean and Yoke-Foong
Tan.
The first day was an individuals
event, each player competing within
their own weight. Our two black
belts, Pete and Dave did very well
and Dave won two bronze medals
in the under 86kgs category—on in
the Universities Competition and
one in the Unis, Colleges and Polys
combined events. Pete started his
day by throwing his first opponent
in five seconds and then proceeded
to win every one of his fights until
drawing in the semi-finals.
Unfortunately, he lost this last draw
on a decision—and so took the
bronze in the under 71kg category.
He got his revenge by very
convincingly beating this same final
opponent in another fight the
following day...!
Jon won his first fight in his first
round, but lost to an eventual
finalist, so finishing unplaced in the
under 78kgs.
Yoke-Foong was left as the only
competitor in the women's under
48kgs category after one woman
was moved up one, and the others
pulled out due to injuries, and so no
competition here was held. She
opted to fight in the higher weight
category rather than pull out
without fighting, but finished
unplaced in the under 25kgs group.
The total medal count for London
after eleven gruelling hours was 2
golds, 1 silver and 7 bronzes.
...Then they all had to get up
again on Sunday morning for the
8.45am start of the teams events.
This was a more exciting day, with
mainly the London Uni and
Glasgow Uni crowds trying to shout
each other down.
In the five-man team event,
London University went on to beat
arch rivals Cambridge in the finals.
The two IC men Pe^e and Dave did
not concede a fight.
IC's four judo representatives Jon, Dave, Pete and
Yoke-Foong.
In the ten-men area competition,
London lost in the semi-finals in a
very close contest against Scotland,
the eventual winners. Hero of this
event was Dave Butles, with the
score standing at two wins a-piece
and five draws, everything rested
with the last fight—Dave's.
Unfortunately, he took a very bad
fall and dislocated his right
shoulder. Despite pleas from his
team, coaches and supporting
crowd not to fight on, he did, after
the first aid crew put his shoulder
back in. But after getting out of a
hold down and then being charged
into the mat on that same shoulder,
he was forced to concede the match
with 45 seconds to go.
In the Women's Teams events,
London could only field a team of
four women and lost their matches.
Yoke-Foong was unfortunate
enough to be drawn against a gold
medallist in the under 72kgs in her
first fight and in her second the
under 61kgs gold medallist, who is
also one of the National Student's
squad going to the USSR this
month.

Fine
Performance
IC III—2
Thames Poly II—0
After a good term, IC Ills wanted to
finish on a high note. Going into the
game with Andy Lewis, a reprobate
from the first eleven, hopes were
high. After a period of heavy
pressure, including some fine saves
from debutant keeper Jasbir Lota, IC
broke into the oppositions D for
Keven Hill to finish superbly for his
first IC goal.
In the second half the pressure
was on the IC goal and only
excellent defending prevented the
score being levelled. After one or
two missed opportunities, a rare
break out of defence gave Steve
Burton a chance to redeem himself
and put the result beyond doubt,
which he did by slotting the ball just
inside the right hand post.

League
Hiccup
The 2nds remarkable record of
fourteen games unbeaten was
stopped on Saturday on a pitch at
Milton Keynes which resembled a
football field. The season began with
triumph in the UAU, defeating all
opposition with a team that other
universities would be proud to call
lsts. 21 goals for and 1 against
ensure a strong position going into
the Challenge Round.
In the Saturday Club league, IC's
strong position in second place has
been under threat as injuries in both
the lsts and 2nds has weakened the
team considerably. Improvement by
players such as Manog Tseung and
Jason Currey, the solid
dependability in defence of John
Blanshard and Paul Turner, and flair
up front from Mark London
supporting centre forward Max
Michaelis have eased the burden,
but the straw that broke the 2nds
backs was added by Milton Keyens
in a hard, determined battle with
close chances at both ends. IC still
remain in touch with the league
leaders and with the return from
injury of several players over the
coming weeks.

UAU
Misfortune
In November an IC team took part
in the UAU individual
championships at Nottingham. In
the men's singles Tim Bartle lost in
the first round and Trevor Kernick
in the second. Both played well
aginst players of a high standard.
Hans Mullannaa did extremely well.
He reached the quarter finals with
great ease where he unfortunately
met the number 41 in the world and
it is no disgrace to lose to people of
this standard. In the mixed doubles
Richard Etheridge and Sue Wain,
Steve Madden and Tarn were
unfortunately knocked out in the
first round but Simon Hughes and
Jo rached the last 16 to lose closely
to a Loughborough pair. In the
men's doubles Trevor and Richard
had the misfortune of meeting the
men's doubles champions in the
first round and Hans and Steve lost
closely to a Lancaster pair. Simon
and Tim though did well to reach
the last 16 eventually losing to an
extremely strong Liverpool pair. A
great weekend was had by all and
thanks are due to Steve's parents for
putting and feeding us up.
