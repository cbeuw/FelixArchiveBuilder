Christmas has many faces, from mince pies to sliced turkey; Santa to the
baby Jesus. Christmas trees, carol singing, and sending Christmas cards,
all are images of Christmas. But have you ever stopped and wondered
where Christmas gets all its 'added baggage' from? After all it is the
celebration of Jesus' birthday; or is it?
The Winter Solstice
Long before the birth of Jesus,
people had held special celebrations
at the time of the winter solstice, the
shortest day in the year. In the
northern hemisphere the winter
solstice ('solstice' literally means
'the sun standing still') falls on
December 22nd.
When people saw the days getting
shorter, they thought that the sun
was dying, so they performed
rituals to make sure of its return.
Worshippers of the sun celebrated
the 25th of December as the sun's
birthday. They built bonfires on this
day to mark the fact that the amount
of sunlight was to now increase day
by day. Druids would make human
sacrifice to their woodland spirits to
appease them and persuade them to
cause growth in the following
spring. Later the ancient Romans
spread a festival called saturnalia
through their empire. It was held in
the latter part of December and
went on for a week. It was given in
honour of Saturn, the god of
everything that grew. During this
public holiday, people exchanged
gifts, especially candles, and slaves
were freed for a day, and allowed
to do and say what they liked.
The Birth of Christ
When Jesus was born 2000 years
ago, there were no birth-certificates.
No-one knows the exact day of
Jesus' birth, moreover we do know
it was not in December, as the
shepherd and the sheep they were
watching would have frozen in the
Palestinian winter. In the early days
of Christianity it was decided to
celebrate Jesus' birthday in
midwinter. This was because it was
already an important occasion. The
festivities that were in existence
were changed from celebrating the
sun's birthday, to celebrating the
birthday of Jesus Christ, God's own
Son.
So celebrating at the end of
December goes back much further
than Christianity, but where did all
the spin-offs we know so well today
come from?
The First Santa
Children are told to hang their
stockings up by the fireplace on
Christmas Eve. Santa then dutifully
fills them with toys and candy when
he comes down the chimney to put
presents underneath the Christmas
Tree. But where did this jolly red
gentleman, who drives his reindeer
team through the skies come from?
The original Santa Claus was St.
Nicholas, the Bishop of Myra in Asia
in the fourth century. He was
famous for his generosity, which is
why he is presented as the giver of
gifts at Christmas.
One story about him is that
because he was a shy man, he liked
to give money anonymously to the
needy. So, one day, he climbed the
roof of a house and dropped a purse
of money down the chimney of a'
family of needy girls. The purse
landed in the stockings which the
girls had hung up by the fire to dry.
Now children expect a similar
'purse' to drop into their own
stockings. These days however the
stockings are generally not so
optimally located, so Santa has to
slide down the chimney in his soot-
proof coat to fill them.
The first European St Nick was
Dutch. He was a bearded man on
a white horse, bringing presents for
good children and a bundle of birch
rods for naughty boys and girls.
When the tradition spread to
America, children thought that he
came from the North Pole, so he
needed a sledge and reindeer. This
is the Santa who-also visits Britain.
The Christmas Tree
The Christmas Tree goes back to the
eighth century, to a missionary from
Devon called St. Boniface. He went
to Germany to teach people about
Christ. There, one December, he
encountered a group of people
standing beneath an oak tree ready
to sacrifice a child to please their
god. Boniface rescued the child and
had the oak tree chopped down. At
its foot was a small fir tree. Boniface
gave this to the people as a symbol
of life. He called it the tree of the
Christ-child.
The story continues many
centuries later in the December of
1540, when Martin Luther, the
famous German church leader, cut
down a fir tree and took it home
with .him. The evergreen tree
reminded him that life continued
through the winter, when most of
nature appeared to have died. He
attached a number of candles to
illuminate the tree and to express
that Christ was welcome in his
home.
But it was not until the middle of
the' nineteenth century, that the
