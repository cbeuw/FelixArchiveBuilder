Look Back In
Anger
By John Osborne at the Theatre
Museum Covent Garden
'Why is Jimmy Porter angry?',
asked puzzled critics of John
Osborne's bitter anti-hero as he
exploded onto the Royal Court's
stage in 1956, depriving them of an
evening of comfortable mush and
breaching the walls of post-war
theatre's sanctuary for imperial
nostalgia.
As Jimmy's wife Alison explains
to her 'Edwardian plant' of a father,
'You're hurt because everything is
changed, Jimmy's hurt because
everything is the same.' Educated,
passionate, and hungry for change
Jimmy's is the voice of post-war
youth. Sceptical of the 'new deal'
promised in the new world of
Labour's Britian, they are bitter at
the reality that the class structure
dinosaur is still casting bleak
shadows on their lives and futures.
Jimmy's response is to go into
battle in his own inimitable way.
Rising to the bait of her parent's
excessive disapporval and their
eccentric schemes to disuade him he
is driven in his pursuit of English
rose Alison, even to the final
desecration of marrying her. With
his enemy hostage intact he daily
wins the petty victories of
persecution with his constant
taunting. His attacks are dampened
only by the presence of Cliff a
mutual friend and 'no-man's land'
between the unhappy couple. So we
discover Alison at the start of the
play; under siege, heading for
exhaustion, and weighed down by
some unwelcome news which she
must find a way to break to her self-
absorbed tormentor.
The living room intimacy of the
Theatre Museum's tiny low level
stage is the perfect setting in which
to subject the audience to the
claustrophobia and ineluctability of
the scenes to come.
In Jim Dunk's new production
Robert Daws has amplified Porter's
obnoxiousness out of the realm
accessible to human sympathy and
into a region where hate and pity
must be our main feelings towards
him. Jimmy's overheated tirades in
the first act may leave you with cloth
ears, off of which the most profound
elements of his rantings may simply
bounce for the rest of the play. In
this he lacks the sugar coated
sarcasm and understated venom
that Richard Burton brought to the
screen adaptation, with a character
whom one felt paid doubly with the
slowburn of self-consuming
bitterness for every insult he threw
at those around him. The frantic
agitation of Daw's Porter, especially
during the first act, hardly cuts as
noble a figure. To interpret this
Molotov cocktail of a man as
something of a psychiatrist's
nightmare can hardly be said,
however, to depart too far from
Osborne's flaming text.
Dunk's approach to the end of the
play is a refusal to cloak Alison's
previous suffering with a neat and
sentimental reconciliation scene; her
pathetically limp figure leaves one
in ni to who is the victim
and „,,w me aggressor in the
supposedly mutual battle. This
floats the issue of the couple's future
as an unresolved question and
prevents an obscuring of the play's
complexities by a 'happily ever
after' ending and as such it is a
welcome interpretation of a much
criticised ending.
In 1956 Jimmy Porter was the
angry young spokesman for an
angry new generation. Today's
generation's are sure to thank
Osborne for the theatrical revolution
of his first play and its legacy of
realism in the theatre, but what do
they make of the bitterness and
anger without their own sense of
struggle? What kind of figure does
Porter cut in the eighties of the
instant coffee hero? The play may be
dated but whether or not it is
irrelevant to the audiences of today
remains for them to judge.
• Why is Jimmy Porter angry? If you
want to find out you're guaranteed
an evening of provocative theatre
that will keep you buzzing into the
wee small hours. You'll leave with
a thirst for more drama with even
half this energy and guts, and with
a tendency towards itchy feet the
next time you're served up a slice
of safe trivial theatre. If, however,
you don't much care, well, they say
that ignorance is bliss.

the Theatre Museum Covent
Garden until December 17.)

I cut myself shaving
Cameron's
Closet
Cert 18
What can I say? This is pretty much
your average, off the shelf demonic,
blood and gore type horror movie.
Here's how it goes, you remember,
when you were five or six year's
old, when you went to bed and you
kept thinking there was something
under the bed or in the wardrobe.
Well in Cameron's case, there is.
Well you can guess the rest, the plot
trundles along at a steady pace
taking the usual trail of corpses
towards the inevitable final
confrontation where the foul fiend
is sent back to the deepest pits of
hell from whence it came.
! The acting is average, and the
director, Armand Mastroianni, has
done his best with the script and an
obviously limited budget. The real
start should bave been Carlo
Ramhildi, who did the special
effects and who was responsible for
FT, Close Encounters and snuff movie
effects in Alien. However, even his
is not up to form and the limited
budget is painfully obvious.
Anyway, give this a miss if you're
into sick-bag movies, I recommend
watching Freddie Kruger on tape for
the 200th time.

Haunted
James Herbert
David Ash is a typical Herbert lead
character. Haunted is a typical
Herbert horror story. That in itself
is not too bad a thing, but it does
give his new book a feeling of
repetition with respect to its recent
predecessors.
Ash is a psychic investigator. He
makes his living exposing fake
mediums and providing rational
explanations for alleged spooky
goings on.
He doesn't believe in ghosts.
The Mariel family hire him to
inquire into the strange experiences
they have undergone in their big old
house, Edbrook.
Ash is hindered by his rationality,
scepticism, and the hosts who are
just bloody odd.
As the story unfolds it becomes
quite clear what is going to happen
at the end, to us if not Ash. He just
gets more confused and jumpy. 'It's
okay David, it's just skeletons
tapping in the closet. Go on let them
out.'
Where this story fails in tension
and surprise. In plot it is too similar
to James Herbert's The Jonah and The
Survivor.
Only the lead role is of
importance. The additional
characters provide a means of
revealing traumatic events of the
past and the discoveries reflect a
naivety and self-deceit which is
slowly uncovered. But they serve
little other purpose.
The predictable cliched remnants
are of course well written and it's
nice to see Herbert return to a more
classical horror theme, absent in
recent books.
However, at £11 for just 224 pages
I can't recommend this to anybody
other than existing converts.
Wait until it's available in
paperback, and buy the James
Herbert compilation in the
meantime.
