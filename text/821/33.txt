Red Heat
The Russians, for the first time,
allowed filming in the Red Square
for an American feature film. It must
be a good film, you may think. After
all, when the Chinese allowed
filming in the Forbidden City, we
got The Last Emperor. So is this a
sweeping epic about Russian
history? No, it's Red Heat, buddy
cop movie. Why did the Russians
allow filming? The official reason is
that it's in the spirit of Glasnost. The
real reason is that they were excited
at seeing Arnold Schwarzenegger
play a Russian.
He plays a policeman teaming up
with a Chicago cop (James Belushi)
to solve a case.
If you think this is an unlikely
combo, wait for Twins next year, in
which Schwazenegger plays twin
brother to Danny De Vito!

Just Ask For
Diamonds
Based on the fast moving comedy
thriller The Falcon's Malteser, this
British film pays tongue-in-cheek
homage to the 'film noir' genre, but
introduces a difference—a thirteen
year old kid is the one who figui
out all the clues. On his -
tracking down a box of malteser-;,
the key to a fortune in diamonds,
encounters a South American
dwarf, The Fat Man, German
assassins, a crooked professor and
a faded night club singer, Lauren
Bacardi.
The film is described as a mixture
of Chandler and Spielberg (which
sounds like Who Framed Roger Rabbit
without animation). Trying to live
up to that expectation, though, is
something else.

'] want Moore'
Like Father
Like Son
' Dudley More has made a career out
of acting like a kid (remember Santa
Claus the Movie), but now he really
does have to act as a kid, in yet
another of those role reversal films,
that Hollywood seems obsessed
with. Here Dud swaps minds with
!his son, played by American
teenage heartthrob Kirk Cameron.
How does he do this! It's obvious,
he unknowingly sprinkles into his
drink a supernatural mind-
switching potion created by an
Indian medicine man!
Although a minor success in the
States, this film was nowhere near
as popular as the excellent Big.

Sunset
After not learning his lesson in Blind
Date, Bruce Willis returns in another
Blake Edwards comedy, starring as
Tom Mix, Hollywood's hottest silent
screen Western star. He meets up
with the legendary Wyatt Earp
(James Garner), on the set of a film,
and together they go off to solve a
Hollywood murder.
Well, I guess it's the best stuff
Willis could find for himself, but if
you think he can only make bad
films, watch out for Die Hard coming
out in February, and you'll think
again.

Share and share alike
Dead Ringers
Shock-king David Cronenberg
(Scanners, The Fly) is back to direct,
of all people, Jeremy Irons. Irons
plays twin gynaecologists who share
the same house, career and
girlfriend, and also share their
*. -ent into insanity.
Don't expect gore and grizzly bits
that have become Cronenberg's
trademark. Instead he opts for the
chilling psychology which is more
akin to another of his works; The
Dead Zone.
Irons is said to be extremely good
in his dual part, so go along and try
to spot the seems.

Moonwalker
Publicity: 'Michael Jackson's
Moonwalker is a story of the classic
struggle between good and evil-
set against stunning special effects
and spectacular song and dance
numbers.'
Hmmm, sounds good, but what
is it about? Well, it seems to be a
collage of videos stuck together,
typical set pieces with Jackson
strutting his stuff. But in all this
there is a retrospective of Jackson's
career, a chase scene involving a
motorcycle and a rabbit, a voyage
through the public's perception of
Jackson; a struggle with a villainous
drugs pusher, sci-fi special effects
and clay animation. In other words,
I don't have a clue what it's about,
but it looks like it's worth finding
out.

The Presidio
It's always good to see Sean
Connery in the movies, and after
the memorable Untouchables he
seems to be in heavy demand. Late
next year you'll see him in Indiana
Jones III and Family Business playing
the fathers of Harrison Ford and
Dustin Hoffman respectively.
Presidio is a murder, mystery,
action, adventure thriller set in San
Michael's impression
of his pet monkey
Francisco, in which Connery plays
a stiff military man, teaming up with
a young local cop (Mark Harmen),
to solve a murder. As an antidote to
the buddy-movie syndrome, these
two characters hate each other,
which I hope brings new spice to a
tired plot. •
