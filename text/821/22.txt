Recent developments in Parliament
have suggested that a Private
Members Bill similar to David
Alton's may be introduced to this
Parliamentary year. It seems,
therefore, likely that abortion-
related issues will be back in the
news in 1989.
Abortion is perhaps a most relevant
issue to young people. It is likely
that within the not-too-distant
future most students will have faced
the questions, whether directly or
indirectly, of having an abortion. In
this article, I, as Chairman of PATA
(Positive Alternatives to Abortion)
would like to put the case against
abortion.
I would like to do this by first of
all discussing the concept of
'Human Life' and then countering
the argument of pro-abortionists.
After this I would like to detail the
various methods of abortion and
finally to conclude by suggesting
alternatives and ways in which the
demand for abortion can be
reduced.
Central to the moral argument
against abortion is the belief that
from conception the human embryo
is a new and distinct 'Human Life'.
However, the term 'Human Life' is
one of difficulty. Depending upon
personal preference it may be
defined in many ways; for example
spiritually, philosophically, or
scientifically. Let us consider these
three approaches for a moment.
The spiritual approach usually
regards 'Human Life' as beginning
at the moment a soul becomes
present. This sort of approach is
associated with religious groups and
although it seems rather vague, it is
important to note that all the
World's major religions oppose
abortion.
The philosophical approach
usually bases its arguments around
vague and arbitrary concepts such
as 'consciousness' and 'degree of
culturization'. As these
philosophical arguments are highly
subjective and very difficult to
prove, there is no general consensus
from this approach.
From the moment of
conception there
exists a complete
human being
Finally, there is the scientific
approach. Unlike the other two, this
approach is neither subjective or
non-provable. It is a biological fact
that from the moment of human
conception there exists a distinct
human being who is both alive and
of the human species—a 'Human
Life'.
What is so significant about the
moment of conception that makes
By the 8th week the
embryo is essentially
complete
it the starting point for life? First of
all, it is the very first point at which
the genetic, physiological and
organic make-up of the embryo is
established. It is the point at which
life, in the form of the growth and
development of the embryo, begins.
Secondly, nothing short of death,
whether by natural or artificial
means, will prevent the embryo
from developing into a newly-born
baby. This cannot be said about any
point before conception.
Let us now consider the
development of this human life
from conception to birth.
At conception the development of
the embryo begins. As soon as the
18th day, the heart has begun to
beat. By the 25th day the embryo's
eyes, spinal cord, nervous system
and major internal organs are
beginning to form. From the 6th
week onwards, brain waves can be
detected, the complete skeleton has
been formed in cartilage and pain
can be felt.
By the 8th week the embryo is
essentially complete. At this time
she (assuming a female embryo) can
spontaneously move her limbs and
responds to touch. Bone is
beginning to replace cartilage and
from now until birth she is known
as a 'foetus'—meaning 'young one'.
In the 3rd month the baby moves
more vigorously, inhales and
swallows the amniotic fluid, and
urinates. Within another month she
is about 30cm long and her heart
pumps 50 pints of blood per day.
She sleeps, wakes, responds to light
and sound and may even suck her
thumb. From now until birth,
further development is largely a
matter of growth. Under British law,
abortion is still allowed for another
3 months.
The first medical ethicist,
Hippocrates, forbade all abortion.
Even as late as 1949, the World
Medical Federation adopted the
Geneva Code of medical ethics'
which state that;
T will maintain the utmost respect
for Human Life from the moment of
conception'
Why have attitudes changed so
much since then? I believe part of
the answer lies in the area of
financial expediency and ignorance.
But more of this later.
Countering the Arguments
A main argument in favour of
abortion relates to the physically
and mentally disabled. The
argument runs; 'If an unborn child
is found to be mentally or physically
disabled, then it is in the interest of
the child and mother that an
abortion be carried out'.
This argument is riddled with
holes. First of all as an argument in
favour of abortion its applicability is
very limited. Of the three milion or
so abortions carried out in England
and Wales since 1967, less than 3
%
were on the grounds of physical or
mental handicap.
Secondly, it arrogantly assumes
that a handicapped person would
rather be dead than alive. Just
because a handicapped person
would rather not be handicapped,
it does not follow that they would
rather be dead.
It is also very unclear about what
actually constitutes a physical or
mental handicap. Surely blindness
and deafness are physical
handicaps! What about a club foot!
Even if the argument dealt only with
the 'severely physically and
mentally disabled', it would still be
equally difficult to define which
disabilities are severe and which are
not. And what gives us the right to
make these kinds of decisions
anyway?
In many ways this argument is
really one of financial expedience.
It is much cheaper to have an
abortion than to look after a
handicapped child. This is a factor
of which governments are very
much aware, but rarely admit.
However, the DHSS did come close
to admitting just this in a report
called 'Prevention and Health:
Everybody's Business (HMSO
1976)', when in reference to the
demands made on the health and
social services by mongol and spina
bifida children, they stated;
'...it seems likely that, in general,
the cost of these demands will
exceed the cost of a program to
detect the condition.'
No civilised society can justify
abortion on the grounds that it is
cheaper to abort than to care.
It is often argued that abortion is
