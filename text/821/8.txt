College pays up on
Linstead sale
The College is to make £5-7000
worth of 'ex-gratia payments' to
students who lost possessions in last
year's Linstead Hall basement sale.
The offers have come after insurance
companies refused to settle claims
over the sale. The payments will be
met by the College's central
account.
The offers have arrived a year
after the Linstead Hall basement
sale, in which students' possessions
stored in the basement of Linstead
Hall were sold. The sale was held
on December 5 last year, after
notices were placed in FELIX telling
students to remove any items stored
in the basement. College officials at
the time claimed that the items sold
had been left in the basement for
some time and were unlabeled.
College Senior Assistant Finance
Officer, Malcolm Aldridge told
FELIX that the College would be
making offers 'without prejudice' to
the students concerned. The offers,
he said, would be 'between a half
and a two thirds' of what the
claimants originally sought.
College Secretary, John Smith
said that if students accept the
claims they will absolve the College
of 'any supposed liability.' He
added that, as 'offers without
prejudice' their offers would not
affect any court case, should
dissatisfied students wish to sue the
College. 'We as a College do not
admit liability,' he said.
Mr Smith went on to say that the
College had 'learnt its lessons'.
There are now rules for storage of
belongings in Linstead Hall
basement. Students are limited to a
storage period of 13 weeks, with a
maximum of £500 worth of
equipment per student. Items must
now be clearly labeled with their
owners name, address, department
and a date of deposit.
Mr Aldridge condemned the
Pro'.'incial insurance company for its
late reply to the claims. The
company, which is responsible for
the College's Halls of Residence
insurance, did not reply to claims
made in January this year until
October. Mr Aldridge said he felt it
was 'particularly bad' that
individual claimants had not been
contacted. He added that the policy
is due for renewal next August,
when he will look at it more
carefully than most of those due for
renewal.
The claims range from £2500
worth of ski equipment to small
claims of £70 or so. Mr Aldridge has
spoken to the claimants of the four
largest losses from the seven he has
officially received. He told FELIX
that he hopes to contact all of the
claimants in writing before the end
of this term.
PNL
picket
Five students at the Polytechnic of
North London (PNL) were
suspended on Tuesday 6 December.
The suspensions were made after a
disciplinary hearing for six students
who protested against MP, Mr
Norman Tebbit's visit to PNL.
Mr Tebbit visited the Polytechnic
in November to speak to its
Conservative Society. A PNL
spokesman told FELIX that Mr
Tebbit was shouted down by
students during his speech. After
the meeting a group of students
rushed past security guards and
'attempted to jostle Mr Tebbit'. The
students were apprehended and
suspended from the College,
pending their hearing on December
6.
A small picket was held by
students outside the hearing and
PNL's Governing Body meeting to
protest against the suspensions.
Merry Christmas Mister Botha
Strong feelings for and against
apartheid were brought to the boil
last Thursday when Debsoc invited
Mr Jan Castelyn from the South
African Embassy to speak on behalf
of the South African government.
Mr Castelyn, who last week
addressed an audience of 800
students in Bristol University,
gained an audience of less than 40
at IC. The low attendance was partly
attributable to a handout by Imperial
College Anti-Apartheid Group
urging students not to attend the
lecture. 'Listening to Mr Castelyn's
speech', they claimed, 'is clearly in
contradiction with our belief.
Mr Castelyn deli -red a thirty
minute speech on the South African
government skirting the issue of
apartheid.
Dr Kevin O'Connor of the
Department of Computing, who has
lived in South Africa for 25 years
was unimpressed by Mr Castelyn's
claims that his audience had only
heard 'one side of the story'. He
described the claim as
'inappropriate, presumptuous,
patronising and a waste of time'. He
also said that Mr Castelyn's speech
lacked substance on the whole, that
it did not address the issues and that
he seemed to be 'out of touch with
the aspirations of the people.'
Mr Castelyn's defence centred
around two themes. He firstly
claimed that sanctions were, and
would be, of negative help. As
companies pull out of South Africa,
he said, they lose their influence,
and their South African employees
lose their jobs. 'Lost jobs don't help
people,' he added. He secondly
insisted that the problems in South
Africa had been exaggerated by the
press, which highlighted only the
bad incidents, he said 'you can find
bombs, street violence and the
killing of innocent people here in
London'.
He did not address the
fundamental issues of state
instigated violence, human rights
and one-man-one-vote. He
frequently insisted that the
government was prepared to talk to
black leaders, many of whom are
imprisoned or in exile. .„
