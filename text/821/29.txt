SAILING
Liam's Luck
Last weekend saw the Sailing Club
travelling to Exeter for the last away
match of the term. After an early
start, Henry was seen discussing
race tactics with the great white
telephone and the Tufty Club were
showing a distinct lack of speed,
probably due to a high facial friction
coefficient. In the first race IC had
â€¢an excellent start but Liam, showing
his naturalflair,decided to give his
boat a bouyancy test and soon
moved back into last position. This
incident resulted in much mirth
from everyone except the captain,
Bill, who realised we were losing,
but by some brilliant tactical racing
from the remaining IC boats, IC
gained first and second places to
win the race. Liam stood out again
in the second race due to the fact
that he had been replaced by
Richard, despite this, IC went on to
win first, second and third places.
By now the wind was building
steadily and the conditions suited
some of the heavier members of the
IC team. For the afternoon session
it was decided that to make closer
racing the IC and Exeter teams
should be mixed. In the third race
Richard lead from the start to take
first place and led his team to a close
victory. Charles had a near perfect
start in the fourth race by crossing
the startline second himself, and
forcing two boats to start badly,
unfortunately, because of the
confusion of the rearranged teams
the boats that had been forced to
start late were on Charles' team.
Despite this Charles went on to lead
his team to a convining win, even
though Richard took line honours
again. After another display of front
crawl from Liam, the wind had
become very gusty with the forecast
for a force 7, so racing was
abandoned for the team to lark
around in Exeter's new boats.
FOOTBALL
Battling Draw
Having gone out of the cup by the
odd goal in nine on Saturday, IC's
sights turned towards the league.
Unbeaten so far, the question on
everyone's lips was 'can they keep
going 'till xmas?'. A poor start, and
a dodgy back pass resulted in a goal
against IC. Another was conceded
later, as some heads began to drop.
However, after the turnaround, IC
looked a different team. Mike
Connor, playing his last game
before returning to the States had a
stormer; Julian Fordham danced his
way around the pitch and Neil
Leonard's tireless running created
space up front. It wasn't long before
IC's start, Guy Phiri found the net
with a shot from the edge of the box.
Then tragedy! Kev Graves, who was
growing in confidence all the time,
went in for a tackle. Badly miss-
timed, it resulted in a very bad break
of his leg. Like a true tour vet, he
gritted his teeth and waited to be
taken to hospital. The gallant
captain Jezz Holland kept him
company, and IC brought on
Cameron Gilmour as super-sub.
Down to ten men IC surged
forward, and it wasn't long before
they gained a penalty after Guy
Phiri was fouled. Ed Coates slotted
it home very nicely and IC got the
draw they so richly deserved.

Neil McCluskey
Neil has adopted the quite
mundane tactic of being seen
regularly in the Union Office. As
to what he does I am not quite
sure. He doesn't sharpen pencils,
staple bits of paper together or do
nothing like the current Union
President.
The fact that Neil is a capable
person (though at what I am not
quite sure) puts him at an im-
mediate disadvantage in his quest
for the post of Union President.
His campaign has been very
low key to date, consisting almost
entirely of articles on the Union
page of FELIX about nothing in
particular. In fact no one seems to
know who he is. So here is a brief
rundown:
He was born and laid in a
manger in Clapham. This wasn't
because there was no room at the
Red Lion inn, but because the
bailiffs had taken the furniture.
He was slung into the mines at
the age of 2 where he was used
to mop sweat of the brows of
miners.
By a stroke of luck, at 15 years
of age he found the Hope Dia-
mond on the floor of the pit and
sold it at immense profit. He then
founded his multinational cor-
poration TCI', moved in with a
girl called Tara, became pregnant,
got into drugs, caught and was
cured of the pox, and finally join-
ed the moonies.
He could chant louder and
more clearly than anyone else, but
was ousted because he caught
verrucas and joined the Foreign
Legion. There he was used and
abused by many of the Officers,
especially Field Marshal Tufty
Fluffball who loved the way he
sat. They would often walk out
into the moonlit dunes together
and describe their stamp collec-
tions beneath star-studded skies.
One night a meteor blazed from
the sky and happened to caontain
some very frustrated aliens. On
eyeing nubile Neil ambling
through the sand they couldn't
resist beaming him up. They us-
ed him and abused him in the
most horrible ways. Suffice it to
say he walked bow legged for
several weeks afterwards. Bored,
the aliens deposited him in a
dreary Quad in South Kens-
ington. There he made his way,
still bow legged, up a set of stairs
to the office where he has remain-
ed ever since.
Liz Warren
Field Marshal Tufty Fluffball
has since had a sex change opera-
tion, changed his name to Liz
Warren and is now responsible
for cooking the books etc in the
FELIX office. Liz, not content with
this numerical gastronomy has set
her heart on becoming editor of
the publication.
Towards this end Liz has set
about learning the intricacies of
the printing machine, typesetting
and tea making, and eating
muesli. Unfortunately, she is tak-
ing the idea that knowledge can
'rub off too seriously and is try-
ing her best to seduce the current
editor.
If she succeeded in her quest,
say sources within the FELIX of-
fice, her staff would be reduced,
through constant nagging, to
quivering jellies within a week.
Robin Davison
Robin Davison used to be the ar-
chetypal nerd, a member of the
Science Fiction society, and a train
spotter until he decided he would
like to stand as FELIX Editor.
Overnight his image completely
changed; the flares went in the
bin and he went into Next to
emerge cravatted and well
heeled.
Rob has taken to writing articles
in the Telegraph and shows an
overwhelming interest in learning
how to use every piece of
machinery within the FELIX of-
fice. Unfortunately Rob is taking
the idea that knowledge can 'rub
off too seriously and Bill often
has to swat him off his shoulder.
Good luck Rob, you will need it.
David Williams
Dave Williams is a man with long
hair and looks like a girlie. David,
will therefore be ideally suited to
take over the post of Hon Sec of
Entertainments, from Wendy
Morris. Dave will be standing on
the ever succesful Bums and Tits
platform, and in fact has already
commissioned FELIX to typesette
his posters which proclaim 'vote
for me I'm a girlie (honest)'.
David's only qualification for
the job is achieving the post of
duplicating officer of RCS Union.
Nevertheless he has already
begun his election campaign in
earnest and at every available op-
portunity wanders around the
Snackbar and says hello to peo-
ple he has never met before.
