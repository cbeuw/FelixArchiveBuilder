Sabbatical Election Results
i wouldn't say I'm devastated that
I lost, but I am pretty upset about
it.' said Angelo Gardini, as he
blundered his way towards the bar
after the announcement of the 1992
sabbatical election results.
After voting in all departments on
Monday and Tuesday, the counting
of ballot papers began at 6.30pm
last night. When the results were
announced at 9 . 4 3 p m , C h r i s
D a v i d s o n had been elected
President. Rick Bilby had been
elected Deputy President, and Jonty
Beavan had been elected Felix
Editor.
The shock of the evening was the
first ever victory for New Election
as Honorary Secretary (Events).
This is only the second election that
New Election has won. In 1990.
New Election was elected to the
post o f Deputy President,
something that had been suggested
for this year.
C h r i s D a v i d s o n . elected
President on the back of the St.
Mary's vote, thanked everyone who
voted for him, and to everyone who
helped out. The disproportionate
influence o f the St. Mary's block
vote was also shown in the Deputy
President and Honorary Secretary
(Events) elections. Its effect was
less marked in the election for Felix
Editor, where it combined with the
Departments o f C o m p u t i n g ,
Mathematics and Physics vote to
help push Jonty Beavan over the
quota on the first count.
Aled Fenner. former Honorary
Secretary (Events) candidate,
blamed the St. Mary's block vote
for the victory o f N e w Election.
'The Mary's vote basically put us
out. both o f us .... they don't really
care anything about Imperial', he
told i C N N in the Union Bar after
the announcement.
Both Aled Fenner and Nick Allen
have declared their intention to
stand again for Honorary Secretary.
Phil Sharp, defeated Deputy
Presidential candidate, also
declared his candidature. ' M e and
Angelo are standing as joint
candidates ... we're standing on the
campaign of 'we'll do fuck all', so
we think we'll get elected.' There
was speculation last night that
DrarrrSoc may also propose an
Honorary Secretary candidate.
Current I C U President, Z o e
Hellinger. said, 'it's a shame about
the Hon. Sec. new election".
Rick Bilby, Deputy President-
Elect. announced himself 'well
pleased for the result. A l l the hard
work I put in paid o f f . Jonty
Beavan. next year's Felix editor,
said he was very happy with the
result. Jonty thanked his colleague
and fellow candidate, Toby Jones,
for running 'a very gentlemanly
campaign', adding 'it's a great
shame he (Toby) lost'.
Absent from the declaration was
Anthony Baldwin, who failed to
surface during the whole campaign.
His proposer, Bruce Hall, said that
his campaign 'was to try to bring
into stark contrast the election
s y s t e m ' , and that B a l d w i n ' s
campaign was designed to give an
opportunity to 'people who wanted
to vote against the way the union is
being run at the present.' Those
who were unhappy with the election
expressed their dissatisfaction both
inside and outside the ballot box.
On a 17% turnout, over 10% o f
votes cast were spoiled. Whether
this expresses frustration with the
Union or unfamiliarity with the
S T V voting system used has yet to
be revealed. (iCNN).
