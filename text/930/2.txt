Comment
Editorial
Well there we have it. Three of next
year's sabbaticals decided upon and
a turnout of about 1150 - 19% of
the electorate. This is better than
last year, and about the same as the
year before, but nonetheless it is
extremely indicative of the attitude
of the Union members to the
running of that same Union. I refer
you to the comments of my last
editorial concerning the voluntary
membership of Unions - this
electorate quite honestly couldn't
give a shit.
On to the candidates. Firstly, this
has been a very clean campaign;
congratulations to all involved. In

all cases bar Felix editor this may
have been because of the complete
lack of character and organisation
of the candidates rather than
because of any particular policy.
Secondly, my commiserations to
those who lost and congratulations
to the winners - at least they had the
get up and go to get involved.
Shame they couldn't have done it
earlier rather than when they
suddenly found out they had no job
next year, but no matter.
It seems that the candidates for
Honorary Secretary - Aled Fenner
and Nick Allen - must have
observed what the present
incumbent has been up to and
decided it was quite a good doss for
a year. This is the appearance they
gave -• if you treat the job like a
joke, the electorate treat you like a
joke. This Union tends to go in
boom-and-bust cycles; years when
the Sabbs take control and shake the
Union into some semblance of
efficiency and years when there is
no effective rudder and control is
left to the clubs and societies. Last
year, under Paul Shanley and Ben
Turner, and the year before under
Neil McCluskey, the Union was
run. This year it has drifted, under
Dear Adam.
Felix Issue 929—'Rector'
Further to my telephone call to
your office this morning, I would
repeat my concern about the
incorrect and misleading
information in the above article.
The post of Rector is not 'due to
be vacated in the immediate future'.
The Rector, Sir Eric Ash, is due to
a Deputy President who nobody
knows, a democratically elected
student representative President
who patently doesn't know what
democracy entails and an Hon Sec
who has been seriously
underworked. And a Print Unit
Manager who has decided the best
way to manage it is by doing the
absolute minimum print unit work,
who is also a Felix editor suffering
the delusion that leaving the Union
office alone will improve relations.
Well, bang goes that. So I'm being
negative - believe me, this Union
deserves it. It claims to represent IC
students, and is often pitted against
the twin monsters of College and
Government, both highly
professional and powerful
organisations, and it is failing.
Under the present system it is not
working for students and it is my
job to point it out. Perhaps I should
have done it earlier. Perhaps I
would have been accused of not
giving the Union a 'chance.'
The Union Office Sabb winners
- Rick Bilby and Chris Davidson -
did not exactly make their name
known in College or Union circles
before standing. I had never heard
of them before - and most things
retire on 31st July 1993 at normal
retiring age.
I should be glad if you would
publish a statement to correct this
error at the earliest possible
opportunity.
With kind regards.
Yours sincerely,
Angus Fraser.
eventually reach the Felix Office.
I sincerely wish them all the best
and I cannot stress too strongly that
they should immediately start
looking into the Union and
formulate ideas about how it should
be improved. But don't fail your
degree, for God's sake. I am not
terribly hopeful about their chances
of success - but I should leave that
to my successor, in whom, I have
to say, I have great confidence. He
is basically two faced, devious and
nasty.
Get rid of sabbaticals and get
some professional staff in. It's the
only way you are going to get
guaranteed quality of service. There
will be another issue of Felix next
Wednesday, 18th March.
