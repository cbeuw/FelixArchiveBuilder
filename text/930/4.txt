Indoor Soccer Tournament
Last Tuesday ( 3 r d March) I
turned up at the Volleyball Court
hoping to play a game of football
against the Italian Society. However
my team mates and I had been naive
to think that we actually would play
football, since we actually
participated in a karate match.
The opposition showed great
technique with their kicks to the
face as well as excellent skill with
their leg sweeps. To top of their
performance, one Italian decided to
see how acrobatic I was with a
perfectly timed trip. Unfortunately,
I was out of practise and landed on
my back, banging my head on the
floor during the process.
After the contest, I was obliged
to see my doctor to see if I could
shorten her stock of drugs. I was out
of luck, since she only prescribed
pain killers, even though she hinted
that I should rest for a few days.
So the morale of this story is that
whilst I was at home convalescing,
there was no one in FELIX to
complete the Indoor Soccer
Tournament page. Thus the
confusion over this weeks fixtures.
This page now has the results for
the games that have been played up
till Tuesday (10th March), and the
latest group tables. The remaining
fixtures for this week are also
shown at the bottom of this page.
Remember, the top team from each
group qualifies for the next stage
together with the two best
runner-ups.

The knock-out phase of the
tournament shall take place next
Wednesday (18th March) starting at
9.30am. A l l teams who have
qualified should turn up at the
Volleyball Court at this time. More
details shall appear in the bumper
end-of-term edition of FELIX.
As for the sponsorship, Nat West
Bank have categorically rejected
our proposal, explaining that the
tournament doesn't qualify for
consideration under their criteria.
However, upon hearing the
outcome of the proposal, M r
Jamieson, our branch manager,
decided to offer IC 1ST Â£100 from
his branch's koffers. But it is a sad
state of affairs when a bank,
operating within a college campus,
G R O U P 1
cannot support the students who
contribute with their hard earned
money, towards making the profits
upon which the bank operates.
Now for a few points of detail.
It seems the Lebanese Society has
been suspended by the O S C .
Therefore, IC 1ST have no option
but to disqualify both their teams
from the tournament. This means
their opponents shall be awarded a
3-0 win. Finally, due to my injury,
a few games were postponed last
week. These games shall only be
played if it is deemed that they have
a direct bearing on the final table
positions.
