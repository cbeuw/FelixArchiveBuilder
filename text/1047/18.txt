Hello and welcome back to a new term here
at ICJS. There are loads of events planned:
here at IC, in London and nationwide. To
add to our weekly bagel lunches, which have
started again (in case you hadn't noticed) in
the S C R at 12.20 on Mondays, next
Tuesday (30th January) is a JSoc Band night
at the Rock Garden in Covent Garden.
Tickets are £3.50 and can be bought on the
door. O n Wednesday 31st January, there
will be a JSoc stall in the JCR for S C C week.
On Monday 5th February Dr. Gary Sagiv is
coming to the bagel lunch. He is an
international lawyer and will be talking
about the implications for Middle East peace
after the Palestinian elections.
Our main event for the term is on
Tuesday 6th February. The Holocaust
Education centre in Nottingham is putting
on a one-day exhibition in the Ents Lounge,
ground floor of the Union Building. A t 5pm,
in the Ents Lounge, Gena Turgel is talking
about her book, entitled "I Never Saw
Another Butterfly". She was held in Belsen
death camp, towards the end of World War
II. Her husband was one of the British
liberators in 1945 and they met, fell in love
and married at the camp. A t 7pm Tony
Robson, a researcher with Searchlight
magazine will be talking about his work in
anti-racism in the SCR. Finally, details will
be out soon about the date and location of
Spring Seminar, the nationwide education
event.
See you at the bagel lunch! For more
details, email us at jsoc@ic.ac.uk, or drop a
note in our Union pigeonhole. Membership
of ICJS is £3.50 for the year.
Opsoc
IT'S ALMOST VALENTINE'S DAY FOR
'THE BOYFRIEND'
Attention! Attention! Yes, it's that time of
year again, when Opsoc performs yet
another spectacle of music, dancing and fun.
The forthcoming show is "The Boyfriend" by
Sandy Wilson. Performance nights are 6th -
10th February and the ticket prices are
fabulous value at £4 (students and
concessions.)
"The Boyfriend" was first performed in
1954 in the West End at the Wyndham's
theatre. It is set in the mid-twenties at a
famous finishing school in the south of
France (oo la la!). The girls are preparing
themselves for a carnival ball, all except
young Polly who has no partner to
accompany her. Until, that is, she meets
Tony. But he is not all he seems (now stop
that! This is a family show!). As with all
good old-fashioned love stories... boy meets
girl, boy loses girl and... well, there's a
surprise at the end! So you'll have to bring
all your friends with you to find out what
happens.
If you're familiar with our previous
winter shows [Cabaret, Chicago, Grease)
you'll already know about our spectacular
sound, superb singing, admirable acting and
colourful costumes, not to mention the toe-
tapping tunes. Much effort and hard work
has gone in to producing the show, and your
support would be very much appreciated.
So, for a Valentine's Day treat, bring
your boyfriend, bring your girlfriend (bring
both!) and enjoy a wonderful evening. Look
out for some of the characters around the
Union shortly before first night.
Tickets are available from Laurie
Tweedale or John Savery and at I C U
reception.

producing a feature about ' R A G E ' and
would like to talk to anyone who has views
on, or has experienced at first hand, this
type of behaviour.

Our studio is situated on Level 3 of the
Union Building.
