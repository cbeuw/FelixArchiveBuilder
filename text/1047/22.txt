Did you know that ICU has:
...27 full-time staff 75 part-time staff 1 cafe bar and snack bar 1 traditional pub type bar 1 bookstore
newsagents 1 print unit 7 minibuses 1 entertainments lounge 1 sports hall 3 sports' grounds 1 dining hal
concert hall (also a cinema) 2 snooker rooms 1 table tennis room I TV studio 1 radio station 6 committ
rooms...
...which somehow manages to house 140 clubs and societies, discos, comedy nights, pub quizzes, a students'
newspaper, an advice centre...
And lots of other things.
Which is all very well if it runs to plan. But sometimes the chips are cold. And sometimes you wonder who you
should speak to suggest that they have more Garth Brooks Country and Western Theme nights. Maybe you want
to know if you can get legal advice because you're having problems with your landlord. Or what night you should
get to the bar to get one of those pints of Caffrey's before the barrel runs out. And what should you do if you want
some publicity posters printed for your club.
So we're suggesting that you all write to the catering manager, or the bookstore manager, or the bar manager, or
the finance manager or the union reception and find out what it's all about: queries, constructive criticism,
suggestions for improvements, and (even) complimentary stuff.
Letters written care off Felix should be in by February 5th, and on Friday February 16th ICU's staff will reply,
and it will become clear....
