Cup hiccup
fails to
distract RSM
An eleven match unbeaten
stretch was brought to a shud-
dering stop last Saturday, with
the R S M being 'kicked' out of
the L U Cup at the quarter final
stage. After R S M missed a
penalty, Holloway scored one to
leave the first half 1-0 up. The
second half saw the miners
pushing forward, yet this proved
ultimately fruitless as Holloway
managed to seal the match in the
final ten minutes.
Wednesday, though, saw
RSM cured of their cup hang-
over in coming up with a win
over Charing Cross Medical
School, Westminster. Goals
from Si (2) and one from
Michels set up an easy win.
Hockey
players in
sarcastic
mood, eh?
What a start, a blown in goal by
Shaggy in the first minute. A
concentrated IC attack led to a
breakaway goal by their centre-
forward, who after several near
crippling ankle injuries managed
to appear in IC's D to score. A
half to half period followed
which resulted in a shot corner
for IC. Silence befell the pitch
the corner was taken, received
by Dave Bacon who skillfully
fluffed a shot past their keeper.
In the second half it was end to
end, almost. No-one scored, we
progress to the next round, they
don't. Roll on IC Hockey.
IC 'bailers
edged out
The IC basketball team played
Q M W in the London College
Basketball League. IC lost 65-
56, but are still able to proceed
to the next round of the league
since qualifying second, behind
Q M W .
This game served to demon-
strate a lack of communication
and understanding between team
members as well as an obvious
lack of practice.
The game was close until the
last minutes and the chance to
win was always there. However,
defensively IC were weak, leav-
ing gaps for the opposition to
either drive in or take easy shots.
Offensively, IC never really
got in gear and were poorly
organised. Guillermo shot well
from the outside. Theodore and
Stellios played a consistent game
but did not perform to the best
of their ability, as with Alex,
who, after having just re-joined
the team, missed all his free
throws and was fouled out leav-
ing him extremely disappointed
with his performance. Effort is
needed in no uncertain terms in
the teamwork department
before the next BUSA game next
month.
Guns! Huh-
huh-yeah...
The West Kent Rifle League was
in an individual short range
(25yd) postal competition. IC
had several entrants and the fol-
lowing placings were gained:
Class C
= 74th NRoyall
= 101st M Eustace
= 115th AEldridge
Never mind, there's always
the summer leagues to look for-
ward to! (Quite)
