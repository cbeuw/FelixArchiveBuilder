Ents
It is time to get funky! The Shaft! crew get
into disco mode, drag out some of their fave
old 70's and 80's records and get ready to
ignite a disco inferno. So if you love anything
from Abba to Adam Ant, Wham to Duran
Duran then this is a chance to relive some of
the best sounds of the last 20 years.
And, for tip-top kitsch sounds, the
Cheesy Wotsits Easy Listening Lounge
wrestles the chill-out room from the grasps
of dub and trip hop, and delivers a blow for
soundtracks, easy listening, and charity shop
chic in the U D H - plus a Cocktail Bar.
If you make an effort and get out your
most excessive threads, then it's FREE!
Otherwise, it's a quid and remember, be
early!

Karting Club
Karting. What is it? Basically if you have the
inclination to reach great velocities, and
Sundays are usually boring - this is the thing
to do. Some of you have no doubt been Pro-
Karting - it is definitely not the same thing at
all. Top speeds are (if you're lucky) 45mph -
the TKM's of the C & G Motor Club will
reach 90mph.
The Motor Club Kart Section Leader,
Tom Bradley (a Miner, as it happens...
Odd...) spends endless amounts of time
keeping the TKMs in excellent working
order, even with a limited budget.
The City and Guilds Motor Club,
particularly the Kart Section, has been more
active this year than it has for a long time, and
eagerly welcomes new students. Membership
is £5, with a further £5 Kart Section fee.
Trips happen most Sundays (keep an eye
on the Felix diary section) to nearby

2.30pm Davinci's. Standing Room Only -
Live FA Cup 4th round match, featuring
Sheffield United against AstonVilla.
The only place for big screen sport.
S u n d a y
locations: Rye House in Hertfordshire, and
Tilbury, two entirely different places with
two entirely different types of circuit.
The Motor Club also has in its possession
a 125cc kart, with top speeds in excess of
130mph, doing 0-60 in 3.5s! This kart has six
gears, and is fully clutched. For use by drivers
with big balls only, believe me!
This year, the Motor Club and its Kart
Section provide a great opportunity to get
'hands-on' involvement with everything
motor mechanical - anyone interested in
driving souped-up lawn mowers?
To get involved, turn up at Mech Eng
340, post a note in the C & G U pigeon hole in
the Union office or send an e-mail to
t.bradley@ge.ic.ac.uk
[The Kart Section apologise for any
inconvenience caused by recent engine trials -
a new garage would, of course, help greatly].
