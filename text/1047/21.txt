EDITORIAL FELIX FRIDAY JANUARY 26TH 1 9 9 6 . TWENTY-ONE
L e t t e r s t o F e l i x :
With reference to Felix
(issue 1046 January 19th 1995),
the BMS Action Group wish to
state wish to state that St. Mary's
Hospital Union have never called
on I C U to make representation
to Kensington and Chelsea bor-
ough council to try to block plan-
ning permission for the new Basic
Medical Science building.
The B M S Action Group,
formed last year to address such
matters, is made up of Sarah
White, I C U President, and
medics from both S M H M S and
C X W M S . It continues to raise
objections over the small alloca-
tion of student social space in the
BMS - eg. the provision of a 48
seater restaurant facility for a
building with a potental occupan-
cy of 1400 people.
For the sake of good order,
the B M S Action Group would
like to correct the figures men-
tioned in the above article ie. the
reduction in student space within
the BMS is from 826 m 2
to little
over 300 m 2
. In addition,
although Ian Caldwell, Director
of Estates, insists the provision
for student space within the BMS
was agreed with I C U during the
summer of 1995, Sarah White
says this was never the case.
At the council meeting last
week, there was a vote to accept
a motion, proposed by Sarah
White, that I C U , and not just
medics, adopt a policy of
demanding adequate social and
recreational facilities of the high-
est quality at I C both now and in
the future.
The BMS Action Group con-
sidered this was far more con-
structive than trying to hold up
planning permission which would
only have served to be detrimen-
tal to all IC students. The issue of
inadequate student social space is
a real problem now and will only
get worse in 1998 with the arrival
of the proposed 1400 students
and staff of the new BMS build-
ing - this is an issue that will
affect all IC students and not just
the Medics.

I had just about got over the
fear and trembling that resulted
after my last trip to the cinema
(in the sense that I could just
about bear to count to the num-
ber seven) when I made the
dreadful mistake of walking
through Green Park the other
day. Troops may be off the
streets in Northern Ireland, but
it seems they are now focussing
on the terrorist heartland that is
the grassy bit that runs alongside
Piccadilly. And just in case a hap-
less young female might be
allowed to recklessly endanger
the community, it seems they
feel they have to leap out from
behind trees in the dark, fully
â€¢ camouflaged and yelling W H A D
D Y E W A N D T ! louder than is
strictly necessary. It wasn't very
pleasant.

For some reason 'whad dye
wandt' reminds me of 'wypi-
wym' which apparently means
'where you point is where you
move'; a tremendous revolution-
ary advance in mouse mat tech-
nology.
Truly we live in a sad, sad
world.

We tireless individuals at
the Print Unit are beginning to
feel that we're operating some
sort of copying equivalent of
Harts' Grocers. It was particular-
ly good to see the R C S U turn up
at 10.30pm on Wednesday night
wanting us to photocopy several
hundred copies of Broadsheet in
time for Thursday morning. Still
mustn't whinge, complain or
grumble...

I have just had a phone call
from Terry Briley, erstwhile
Deputy Head of Security, who
was concerned that last week's
Felix had worried a few people.
We said that he was on 'extend-
ed leave' whereas 'sick leave'
would have been more appropri-
ate, and certainly implies rather
less blame on his part. Terry is
likely to be retiring permenantly
at the end of March: he tells me
he's 'getting too old for this game
now'. (Funny, I was thinking
rather the same thing about
myself...)
Felix wishes him all the best
for the future.
