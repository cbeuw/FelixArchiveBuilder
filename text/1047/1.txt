Biomedical plans delayed again
BY RACHEL WALTERS
Architects Norman Fosters' plan-
ning application for the Basic
Medical Science (BMS) building
has again failed to be considered
by Kensington and Chelsea coun-
cil. IC will now have to wait until
next month before their planning
application can be considered.
Ian Caldwell, IC Estates
Director said that he 'was under
the impression' that the proposal
would be considered at Tuesday's
planning officers' meeting and he
admitted that 'we're obviously
getting somewhat concerned.'
But he insisted that the building
would still be on target if plan-
ning was granted at the meeting
next month. The BMS centre is
due to be completed by Easter
1998.
The Students Union
Presidents of St Mary's and
Charing Cross and Westminster
medical schools have met Chris
Edwards, Dean of the new med-
ical school, and Ronald Oxburgh,
IC Rector to discuss future facil-
ities on campus. They have
agreed to set up a committee to
consider students' social space.
ICU President Sarah White said
that she was 'very pleased',
although she acknowledged that
'they didn't promise us anything
material at all.'
St Mary's President Sarah
Edwards said that all the con-
stituent colleges of Imperial were
working together to lobby for
improvement of student facilities
across the campus. She has
entirely dismissed suggestions
that an attempt at blocking the
planning application was being
considered.

night on monday, presenting sketches, songs and some liquid
refreshment for the department's students. The Head of
Department, Bill Wakeham, is pictured here in a striped rugby shirt
joining in on one of the sketches, proving that even chemical engi-
neers have talent.

A new Government funding pro-
ject for the purchase of equip-
ment will put science researchers
under even more pressure to find
funding from private industry.
The Government has launched
an £18m fund for research
equipment, but money will only
be granted to applicants who
have been able to secure an equal
amount of funding from alterna-
tive sources.
This places research institu-
tions in a double jeopardy situa-
tion from which Imperial is like-
ly to benefit. But other universi-
ties less close to industry will suf-
fer at yet another step by the
Government to reduce research
funding as a result of budget
cuts. The press release announc-
ing the initiative lists alternative
sources as industry, charities and
government departments. It is
clear, however, that the majority
of funds will come from indus-
try. Those institutions which can
exploit their relationship with
industry will receive double
money, those that cannot will
have no access to the funds.
The new scheme increases
the already high pressure on
research institutes and universi-
ties to find funding from private
industry. Investors are unlikely
to be keen to provide money for
new equipment just to make
good a shortfall in Government
funding. Those who are most

Holloway revenge
The Royal Holloway student
newspaper Orbital has admitted
that last term's theft of the I C U

after IC students stole the un-
