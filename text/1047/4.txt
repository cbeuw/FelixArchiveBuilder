The President of Imperial
College branch of the Association
of University Teachers, Brian
Wilson, has pledged to resist the
7% cuts in higher education fund-
ing which have been imposed on
the sector. The drop in funding is
equivalent to Â£300m in real
terms.
Speaking to Felix, he also
said that the A U T will strive to
protect their members. The
AUT's view is that there should
not be any cuts in staff and if
need be then cuts should be
made in other areas. Adequate
and quality staff are essential in
order for a university to run prop-
erly.
With the cuts in funding,
there are fears over lecturer's pay
and top-up fees. Brian Wilson
commented that approximately
80% of the College's money is
spent on staff salaries, so the
tempation is there to limit this by
a pay freeze and staff cuts. He
went onto say "the college should
be able to retain all staff and pay
them fair salaries from turnover...
such as research contracts."
Noting that academic staff
are paid comparatively less than
other professions, and that they
recieved smaller increases in pay,
he stressed that academic staff
deserve more for their work. "We
are expected to cope with
increasing student numbers with
less and less staff" he said.
"University lecturers are also
expected to spend at least 50% of
their time on research. We also
have the duty of handling more
and more students. Organizing
[teaching] also takes a lot of time
and effort and this... is increas-
ingly getting heavy. We are very
keen to maintain the quality of
teaching and research here... but
at the same time the numbers of
back up staff... are increasingly
reduced."
On the matter of top-up
fees, M r Wilson said that "the
A U T is against any sort of stu-
dent fees in whatever guise.
Basically in present form, this
top-up fee is an ad hoc way of
recovering the funding cuts,
without proper understanding
especially in big cities. The whole
thing has to reviewed."
Mr Wilson also expressed
concerns relating to increasing
'casualisataion' of academic staff:
"Temporary staff are increasingly
being employed in many universi-
ties. IC have tried to avoid
employing short-term staff
because it has realized that it is
deleterious to IC's reputation as a
leading teaching and research
institution.
"There is also an increasing
trend in universities to use tem-
porary lecturers and researchers
because universities are not as
secure as they used to be." When
asked to expand on this, he said
that the government used to pro-
vide funding on a 5-yearly basis
and every university knew how
much it had so it could plan
ahead, whereas now universities
are less certain about how much
funding they will receive.
The A U T is now formulating
a document to submit to the
C V C P , in which they demand a
modest increase in salaries and a
readjustment of the salary scale
on behalf of their members. This
motion will then be sent to the
government.
Praise for students reaction to burglar
BY ALEX FEAKES
Students of the Southside halls
of residence came in for praise
over their role in the apprehen-
sion of a suspected burglar last
Thursday. The alarm was raised
by students when a computer
and a stereo hi-fi were discovered
in a bathroom (Stop Press, Felix
1046).
Kenneth Weir, the new
Deputy Head of Security, was
particulary impressed with those
residents who stopped and chal-
lenged the intruder, and subse-
quently reported him to the
housekeeper. A number of sight-
ings of a man behaving suspi-
ciously were reported, and after
the missing electrical equipment
was found, security were noti-
fied.
The security response to the
intruder was to monitor the exits
to the building, and then to
search the building for the man,
said to be young, Asian and wear-
ing a dark blue jersey and jeans.
Within thirty minutes, a man fit-
ting that description had been
apprehended on the upper gallery
by security officers. When he
failed to provide a satisfactory
reason for his presence, he was
taken to the security lodge and
held there until the police
arrived. A t the time of going to
press, the suspect's name has not
been released, and a link between
the misappropriated property
and the intruder has not yet been
firmly established.
Speculating on how the bur-
glar might have gained entry to
the hall, M r Weir said that the
most likely way was for him to
have followed another student
when they entered the hall. He
did concede, however, that there
was a security weak point where
contractors working in Southside
have access to the building,
though it was being covered in a
current security review.
