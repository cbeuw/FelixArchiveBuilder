Aldwych Group replies to budget
BY MIKE INGRAM
Attacks on the Government's
policy on the funding of higher
education have been stepped up
this week. The Aldwych group of
student unions has sent an open
letter to the Committee of Vice
Chancellors and Principals
(CVCP) restating its opposition
to students being charged top-up
fees.
The letter was written at last
Thursday's meeting of the group,
which is concerned mainly with
higher education funding. The
meeting was attended by the
ICU President Sarah White. A n
accompanying article intended
for publication in the next edi-
tion of the Times Higher
Education Supplement is also
being prepared. This is intended
to make the position of student
unions clear before the next
meeting of the C V C P on
February 2nd.
They describe top-up fees as
"a short term option", likely to
"legitimise future reductions in
public spending by the
Government". The group points
out that any altered funding sys-
cemtinued from front page
likely to benefit from the new
fund are those who already have
close relationships with industry.
This view is upheld by a
spokesperson for the C V C P who
said that "if they [private invest-
ors] provide money for equip-
ment, they will want it to be used
only lor research projects they're
already funding."
This attitude is certainly true
in the case of Imperial College,
which is in a very strong position
to do well out of this initiative.
Dr David Thomas, Pro Rector for
Research Contracts says that IC
will certainly be taking part,
"Imperial is well plugged into
industry, we will go hard at this
and should succeed quite well."
Dr Thomas feels confident that
this will help Imperial to secure
the funds necessary to buy
tern "should be... the mechanism
we would like to have in place,
not rushed in because of a short-
term crisis." They predict that
attempting to combat inadequate
funding with top-up fees would
fundamentally undermine the
quality and accessibility of higher
education, and worsen the
already increasing rates of acade-
mic failure and dropping out.
The letter follows recent
speculation that Universities may
be forced to impose levies on stu-
dents to make up for cuts in gov-
ernment funding. The cuts,
announced in last November's
budget, reduce the total amount
of money spent on higher educa-
expensive equipment for the new
medical school.
The initiative was formulat-
ed after the budget, but the
Government denies that it is due
to the spending cuts. It will be
run as two competitions, com-
petiton A with funds of £5m will
cover bids for equipment worth
up to £250,000; competition B
with £13 million will cover bids
for items worth over £250,000.
This formula won't apply in
Wales where there will be just
one competition, and although
the competition has been
announced, entry details and
guidelines have not yet been
made known.
This is not the first funding
competition run by the
Government; in 1995 there was a
competition for Industry-
Academia collaboration. Entrants
tion by over 31%. The Russell
group of top universities, which
includes Imperial College, con-
vened an emergency meeting in
December to discuss the cuts,
after it was revealed that
Manchester University was being
forced to consider top-up fees to
achieve a sufficient level of fund-
ing.
Imperial College has indicat-
ed that it is opposed to the idea,
preferring to look to fees from
overseas students to make up the
difference. In the long term,
however, it may have no choice
but to charge students. Univers-
ity league tables published in
recent years have shown Imperial
were expected to describe their
efforts and successes at building
collaborative links with industry.
The results of the competition
will be announced soon this year.
The two winners (one for science
the other for engineering) stand
to receive a first prize of £35,000
each, the two runners up will
receive £15,000.
While this initiative is good
news for IC departments with
clear industrial links, as Govern-
ment funding for science
research shrinks further, money
for areas of research that are
unpopular with private industry
will have to be found elsewhere.
Researchers' time will be taken
up applying for elusive grants
instead of carrying out the re-
search that they hope to pursue,
thus making that research less
efficient and more expensive.
to have one of the highest levels
of student funding in the coun-
try, and the College will have dif-
ficulty absorbing cuts of over £2
million a year.
Student opposition to top-up
fees is becoming more vocal. Last
week, the president of Durham
University's S U called for "a
national campaign to get the
recent budget cuts into the
news", and scheduled the 29th of
February as a national student
action day [Felix 1046).
However, this zeal is by no
means universal. It has been
noted in some quarters that the
NUS have been uncharacteristi-
cally lost for words. There have
been suggestions that this is con-
nected to the fact that the nomi-
nation stage of the body's
National Executive elections
reaches its climax this week.
Sarah White described its silence
as "surprising", adding "if I were
in the N U S , I would expect them
to campaign". A spokesperson for
the N U S replied "[we have been]
meeting [recently] with the
C V C P " and "very much com-
plaining about these cuts."

St Mary's Hospital has
turned away 41 children with
meningitis to other hospitals in
the past year. Two of them died
in December after the hospital
could not find beds for them.
According to a newspaper study,
there is a nationwide bed and
staffing crisis in paedratic inten-
sive care units.
The study revealed that
other top hospitals not able to
cope with demand for beds,
included the Great Ormond
Street Hospital for Sick
Children.
The British Medical
Association have called for
immediate action to resolve the
crisis.
Europe-wide funding crisis looms
The rising tide of protest against cuts in higher education from both
universities and students is not confined to Britain alone. Education
ministers from all over the European Union have been meeting
recently to discuss funding strategies for higher education across the
community. Many governments are under pressure to trim public
spending on universities, leading to widespread protests in Germany
and political disagreements within the French authorities them-
selves. With funding schemes based on commercial involvement
proving unpopular among universities, it is becoming more impor-
tant for a viable strategy to be found.
