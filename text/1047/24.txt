IC 44 - 5 R. HOLLOWAY
Imperial started well against a
depleted Royal Holloway side.
From the outset Big Jack showed
the way with determined and
destructive running which led to
the first of many tries on a
promising afternoon.
Royal Holloway, despite
being a man down, replied with a
strong period of possession and
forceful running, producing a
brilliantly executed equalising
try. Imperial College's men
responded quickly through their
tireless backs, with good straight
running and the ever-reliable tor-
ward support producing several
team tries. Tim Oldham led with
determination as usual and the

team produced the best all round
performance of the season.
Individual mentions must go
to the captain, also the afore-
mentioned 'Big Jack' and Jean
Phillipe, whose inexhaustible
supply of tackles ground down a
spirited Holloway comeback to
the point of submission.
It must be noted though,
that a contributing factor to this
impressive scoreline was the fact
that R H finished the game with
only thirteen players. They were
one winger short at the start, and
the smallness of their squad was
highlighted when their flanker
was forced to retire through
injury. Nonetheless, an impres-
sive win.

KCL IV 4 - 1 IC IV
This game swung dramati-
cally to King's College after an
unjust decision by the attention
seeking referee. After 34 min-
utes when the score was 2-1, a
through ball split IC's defence.
Showing his alertness Stuart
Cook, the 'keeper, raced out of
his area only to be beaten to the
ball by the striker whose first
time shot into the 'keeper's
body struck the keeper's hands.
The referee judged that it was
deliberate hand-ball and despite
heated protests the Hitleresque
referee sent off the crest-fallen
'keeper. Incidentally, the King's
College players showed their
wisdom by appealing for a penal-
ty<
The score-line was kept
respectable by the stand-in
'keeper, Paul Smith, who by
luck or judgment deflected,
diverted and parried numerous
goal-bound efforts. The second
half produced a determined and
gutsy performance by the ten
men of IC and it is to their cred-
it that the team did not collapse
as surely they would have done
earlier in the season.
Speaking after the game
Stuart Cook said that he could
hardly believe that he had been
sent off for the first time in his
career. He recollected various
similar incidents where "proper"
qualified referees, on telly, had
used their common-sense and
distinguished between deliber-
ate goal saving hand-ball and
accidental hand-ball.
The IC Fencing club contin-
ued it's impressive winning
streak with a comfortable victo-
ry over Salle Michael Joseph last
week by 45-39. The team of
Alex Davies, Charles Cooper
and Nick Manton started and
finished very strongly, but
relaxed slightly in the middle,
otherwise the winning margin
would have been much higher.
This win takes the college into
second place in the London
Premier League.
Reaffirming Imperial's dom-
inance in fencing this season, 6
out of the 8 fencers selected for
the London University men's
squad picked for last weekends
match against Cambridge were
from IC. They were Charles,
Nick, Alex, Shafik Saba (c),
Reuben Kalam and Eddie
Rysdale (2 weapons). Liz Kipling
was also selected for the
women's epee team.
