P H O T O : WILLIAM L O R E N Z

the newly installed snack machine promptly broke down on its first
day at I C U . It was repaired on Wednesday, but broke again later
that evening.

A drug addict on remand at
Holloway prison who was kept
chained whilst receiving treat-
ment at St Mary's Hospital has
had her chains removed. She had
been kept handcuffed for nine
days while a patient at the spe-
cialist H I V unit.
The 34 year-old woman
patient, known only as 'Jane', is
seriously ill with H I V related
complications. A massive public
outcry, instigated by the national
press, led to the chains being
removed. The campaign forced
ministers to soften the contro-
versial 'cuffing and chaining' pol-
icy at Holloway, especially where
pregnant or sick women were
involved.
Jane's case, which was high-
lighted by the Independent on
Sunday, has triggered condemna-
tion from health workers and
women's and human rights
groups. The 'cuffing and chain-
ing' policy failed to discriminate
between those who posed a secu-
rity risk and those who did not.
The decision to remove the
chains was reached after negotia-
tions between St Mary's Hospital
and Prison Service officials.
'Jane' was said to delighted. She
had been chained even when she
went to the lavatory and when
she slept.
Her lawyers are considering
whether to sue the Home Office
for damages. They are also con-
sidering a judicial review of the
policy, which they claim breach-
es the Government's obligations
under the Convention on Human
Rights.

BMS site in safety
waste fear
Ian Gillett, head of the College
Safety Unit, has been quelling
fears over the possible discovery
of dangerous waste at the site of
the new BMS building, currently
under construction next to the
Chemistry Department. "As far
as the building's concerned,
there's been no toxic waste," he
said. He added that other routine
waste, such as mercury and
asbestos, was present at the site
but was being dealt with safely.
IC's contractors, Schal, have
brought in analysts to locate
these substances so that they
could be removed successfully.
He stressed the importance
of dealing with toxic substances
correctly: "If there is anything
there, I'd love to know about it."
Earlier this week, STOIC,
IC's T V station, were asked to
leave the site after attempting to
film work on the project.
Kenneth Weir, the Deputy Head
of Security, said this was likely to
have been due to the safety
aspects of their presence.
Permission to photograph the
development now has to be
obtained from College's Estates
Department.
C&G's Hovercraft
In a separate development, the
City & Guilds Union (C&GU)
Hoverclub were able to reclaim
their hovercraft after it had been
left in storage in a garage in the
chemistry building due to be
demolished. According to a fore-
man at the site, Planning Officer
Brian Dennis arranged for the
vehicle to be moved to behind
the RCS1 building on
Wednesday.
However, the students say
they are unhappy with the way
they have been treated. Austin
Jones, Honorary Secretary of the
C & G U Motor Club, said that
they had been unable to move
the hovercraft earlier because
they had no alternative storage
space for it. He added that the
Estates Department had been
approached for help, as well as
ICU. "Tim Townend was repeat-
edly asked and has done noth-
ing," he said.
Austin said that they had
lost the five parking spaces that
the club once used. He felt that
college "don't care about the
Motor Club" saying that they
seemed to think "it's not their
problem." Neither Tim Townend
nor Estates were available for
comment as Felix was going to
press.
Rug in RH picture
ICU's front doormat, pinched by
Royal Holloway students in a
raid last term, was the subject of
an article in Orbital, their college
newspaper. The piece, accompa-
nied by a photo of the rug,
offered some insight into the
motives for the attack. One stu-
dent claimed that it could have
been taken as a revenge attack
after IC students stole Royal
Holloway "union's cuddly toy
mascot Collossus, burnt it and
later returned its ashes as a prac-
tical joke".
The rug itself has been
returned, though it is unclear
how I C U responded to the stu-
dent's suggestion that "We
should chop it up and send it
back a piece at a time."
Finance Society
Penniless
Felix has learned that IC's
Finance Society has become
'financially embarrassed'. O n
account of the poor state of their
balance book, they are no longer
permitted to incur any more
debts until the situation
improves.
Rag Chair Apology
Last week's Felix (1046) inaccu-
rately reported that Rag Chair
Jon Lambert had "blamed the
weather" for the drop in Rag's
takings from the beer festival this
year. In fact he had really blamed
the fact that the sports teams
were playing away that day. Felix
would like to apologise to Jon
Lambert for the misunderstand-
ing.
