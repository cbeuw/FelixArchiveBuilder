The Clock on the Union
Building is once again keeping
time after a group of past and
current students repaired the drive
mechanism and constructed a new
power system. The Clock had been
non-operational for over three years
after the original control system
on Campus was removed and a
replacement mechanism failed.
The project to repair the Clock was
undertaken as a memorial to Imperial
alumnus Andrew ‘Wiz’ Wilson who
passed away last year. He had been
involved in looking after Jezebel, the
1916 Fire Engine mascot of the RCSU,
for over 40 years and was an active
member of the ‘22 Club.
Members from RCS Motor Club
and the ‘22 Club dismantled the old
clock mechanism and removed the
hands of the clock before Christmas
as they had identified that parts of
the original drive mechanism had
been become damaged by the new
control unit, which had been installed
to take over the running of the clock
after College dismantled the central
control unit that drove all the clocks
on campus.
Dr Andrew Pugh, alumnus,
then re-wound the solenoid and
assembled a control unit based on a
programmable computer with a radio
receiver, enabling the system to access
the UK’s national civil time signal
broadcast from Cumbria. The new
system was installed last Saturday

An email was sent out this week
to all second year physics
students, apologising for the
department’s response to a series of
exam blunders that went uncorrected.
An assessed problem sheet (APS)
featured a mistake in one of the
questions, and after students raised
the issue, was told to “take it on the
chin…it’s a drop in the ocean.”
This follows a similar incident that
took place last term, after students
relayed to another member of staff
that a multiple choice question in
a revision maths test didn’t have a
correct answer. Again students were
told it was too insignificant to be
rectified.
The email, sent by Senior Teaching
Fellow Dr Vijay Tymms, stated: “I
apologise for the way I handled the
incident and any upset caused…I’ll try
and pause for thought in the future.”
He also invited any students
affected to email him directly with
the marks they think they deserve,
and he will alter them accordingly.
“No need to send any proof, I’ll take
your word for it. I should have said
something akin to this in the first
place,” said Tymms.
Back in December, students
noticed that a question on an APS
was incorrect a few days before it was
due to be submitted, and contacted
Tymms about the issue.
After a corrected version of the
question was sent out to the second
year students, Tymms also emailed to
address what those who have already
submitted their APS should do.
He told them he’d prefer students
simply take “this on the chin, as it’s a
drop in the ocean really and it’ll save
time for everyone, but of course I
understand if you want to claim full
credit if hard done by.”
Last October, Professor Warren
who oversees the maths revision test,
was emailed about a question in the
test, which was thought to not have a
correct option in the multiple-choice
questions.
Warren replied to students in
January, confirming that their
suspicions about the impossible
question were correct. Warren
admitted that the question had
been used in this identical format
for several years, and said it was
“peculiar” that it had not been
spotted before.
He also told the students that the
consequences were “very minor” and
said that changing the scores of the
test in light of this error would make
no difference.
The student who spotted the error
then challenged Warren, but Warren
did not relent in his decision. He told
the student: “I don’t see a fairer way
of dealing with it other than to ignore
it.”
However, once the issue was
forwarded through to Tymms, it
was decided that the question would
be struck from the exam and a new
mark would be assigned from the
remaining questions.
One student elegantly concluded
that: “the department doesn’t seem to
realise that even an ocean is made up
of a finite number of drops.”
Felix spoke to Professor Warren,
who told us why he initially thought
it was best to ignore the error: “Given

the number of correct answers to
that question it’s clear that many
students worked out the error in the
formatting and inferred the correct
answer!
“If the question was cancelled they
might be aggrieved that their hard
work was not rewarded. For this
reason I decided to leave things as
they were.”
Warren pointed out that the
question was worth 0.1% of a single
second year module, but decided to
drop it after students commented
on the initial decision to ignore the
error completely. “On reflection I am
happy to agree that this is probably a
little bit fairer overall, although the
smart students who worked out the
error probably would not agree.
“In any case I am grateful to the
student who found the problem,
and to those who questioned the
solution.”
and the clock started working
correctly that afternoon.
The system is designed to cope
with power outages by recording
what positions the hands are in
when power fails and then moving
them to the correct time when power
is restored. This was put into use
within a day of the new system being
installed, when the Union suffered a
power outage during the Superbowl
on Sunday evening.
Since the system is based on the
radio broadcast time, the clock will
automatically update itself when the
clocks change meaning that very little
human input will be needed to keep
the clock showing the right time.
The group would like to thank
Ali Lown and Dramsoc for their
assistance in accessing the clock-face.
