Ed Milliband, Labour party
leader, has promised to
decrease tuition fees to £6,000.
However vice-chancellors of the
Russell group universities have said
this is “implausible” as it would
leave a £10 billion hole in University
Revenue and could lead to “cuts
to universities that would damage
the economy, affect the quality of
students’ education, and set back
work on widening access to higher
education”. The policy could also
potentially cost the government
£2.5bn a year.
In order to cover the shortfall
from the lowering the fees, Labour is
considering asking higher-earning
graduates to pay bigger interest rates
on their loans and making them
continue repayments for a period
even if they settle their debt early.
During the Prime Ministers
Question Time last Wednesday,
Conservative MP David Willetts
said that he welcomes the increase
in students applying to University,
especially those from the poorest
backgrounds, before going to ask
the Prime Minister to confirm that
lowering the fees would negatively
affect both Universities and students
invidually.
Mr Willetts further went on
to claim that Labour’s policy of
lowering fees would only help rich
graduates, questioning how such a
policy could be called progressive.
The Prime Minister answered that
the University funding system was
a long-term plan that has delivered,
adding that Labour has no clue:
“When are you going to make up
your minds and set a policy.”
Ed Milliband has repeatedly
mentioned his intention to lower
tuition fees but has yet to issue a
“manifesto” pledge.
The Business, Innovation and
Skills (BIS) Committee called for an
urgent review of the system, saying
the Chancellor’s removal of the cap
on student numbers may result in a
multi-billion pound budget gap.
The commission forecasted that
for every £1 the government lends
out in student loans it loses 45p. The
loss in the previous system was only
28p.
“With the prospect of a large
potential black hole in the
government’s budget figures, it
is all the more alarming that the
Government has refused to conduct
a review of the current student loan
system,” said Adrian Bailey MP,

Counter Terrorism bill
Baroness Manningham-Buller also
voiced concerns on the bill, during
a debate in the House of Lords last
week.
Said Manningham-Buller: “There is
a profound irony in seeking to protect
our values against this pernicious
ideology we are trying to bar views
too vaguely described as non-violent
extremism, which falls short of
incitement to violence or to racial or
ethnic hatred or the other legislative
constraints on Universities.”
The bill was introduced by Theresa
May, the Secretary of State for
the Home Department, back in
November, and has rapidly moved
through the House of Commons and
the House of Lords. Mrs May said
of the bill during its second reading:
“Today…the threat from terrorism
is becoming ever-more complex and
diverse.”
May hopes that with “cross party
support” that it can be fast-tracked
through Parliament before the
general election next May, and hopes
it will combat any threat from people
joining the Islamic State in the UK,
alongside combating other terrorist
organisations too.
On Wednesday, the House of Lords
agreed to include a Home Office
amendment in the counter terrorism
bill that states that colleges should
still consider free speech when
complying with other elements of the
bill.
These approaches were introduced
post 9/11 as part of the government’s
counter-terrorism strategy, known
as CONTEST. CONTEST included
strategies for Preparing for an attack,
Protecting the public, Pursuing
attackers, and also Preventing
radicalisation: known as the
sophisticated sounding “Four P’s.”
The Prevent strategy remains
deeply controversial despite the
millions of pounds invested into it by
the government. Initially there was
division in what this should actually
entail, but after 2005 and the 7/7
bombings, £80 million was spent
on 1,000 schemes across 94 local
authorities.
These schemes included paying
to free speech in universities
for more CCTV cameras in areas
with a high percentage of Muslim
inhabitants, which caused uproar.
They also include introducing
community Prevent Officers, that
liaise with institutions and are known
to ask about any “issues” student
unions may be having with their
respective Islamic Societies.
The Prevent strategy was launched
in 2007, but was re-launched in 2011
to refocus on University activity,
after the “underwear bomber” Umar
Farouk Abdulmutallab, was known
to have been studying at UCL. He
confessed and was convicted of
attempting to detonate explosives
hidden in his underwear whilst flying
over from Amsterdam to Detroit.
Chair of the BIS Committee. Adding
that: “the Government apparently
believes it could hike up the interest
rate of their loans without this
constituting a change in the ‘T&Cs’.”
Something that is a majorn concern
to all students with outstanding
loans and anyone consdering
applying to University.
The government, which has cut
teaching grants to Universities as
part of the austerity program, argues
that higher tuition fees are needed to
maintain standards.
While student loans, maintenance
grants and University bursaries
are in place to ensure a wide
participation from students from
poorer backgrounds, often students
will rack up debts on average
£43,500 in debts by the time they
graduate.
Imperial College Union recently
updated their policy on higher
education funding, and decided to
lobby the government to stop an
increase to tuition fees.
Alex Savell, Deputy President
(Finance and Services), gave his
thoughts on the proposal: “While
in principle the Union applauds any
step to reduce tuition fees, if the
£6000 cap comes with no increased
state funding or an additional tax on
high earning graduates then it is not
a step towards the ideals we support
in spite of appearances.
“Slipping in a Graduate Tax
via the back door in particular is
neither transparent, nor fair and it
is not what Imperial College Union
believes is right for it’s students.
“We have a clear objective and
demand: Reverse the decision to
raise Tuition Fees to £9000 without
reducing the commitment to
Widening Participation by a single
penny.”
