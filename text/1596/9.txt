The Greens have been all over
the news recently, from David
Cameron’s insistence that they
appear in general election debates
earlier this year, to the announcement
that their membership has surpassed
that of UKIP and is rapidly rising.
The Green Party would have us
believe that this is the beginning of
a new wave of left-wing, ecologically
and economically responsibly
politics, a ‘Green Surge’ to wash away
the ossified major parties and the
dangerously populist UKIP.
For all of the talk of fairness and
a bright new future, my advice is to
steer well clear.
Science policy is a litmus test in
politics. American Republicans and
our own UKIP are ridiculous in their
insistence that anthropogenic climate
change is ‘not a thing’, and their
science and environment policies
read like they were written on the
back of a cigarette packet by Alan
Partridge. In its own slightly more
subtle way the Green Party can be just
as bad.
The Greens talk a lot about ending
world hunger and tackling poverty.
This is why we saw the Green Party,
represented by senior party members
such as their London mayoral
candidate Jenny Jones, tacitly endorse
the vandalism and destruction of
publicly funded GM crop research
at Rothamstead in 2012. This
research, which has nothing to do
with any agri-business or big bad
corporate entity, aimed to reduce
the use of harmful pesticides in the
production of wheat. This would
increase the yield of staple crops and
reduce dangerous chemical runoff; it
would benefit the environment and
chip away at hunger. This was not
important to the Greens.
They are very keen to say that
we should take action on carbon
emissions and energy: I mean, why
else would they insist that we turn
off all of the nuclear power stations.

It’s not like the largest source of
low carbon electricity is something
that would help towards those aims,
or that the European country with
the lowest CO2
emissions (a clue
– baguettes and infidelity) makes
extensive use of unfashionable
but clean nuclear power. Instead
they say that we should get arms
manufacturers to make windmills
and solar panels, which is code for
“import gas from Russia and coal
from Australia” and “we don’t
understand the need for a mix of
different energy sources”.
They are too bogged down in
narratives of science and progress
‘flying too close to the sun’ and
‘meddling with nature’ to realise that
the solutions to the problems that
they identify are to a large extent
scientific and technological. A train
ride down the Green heartland,
Brighton Pavilion, illustrates this
very well: Advertisements for palm
readers, astrologers, and all kinds of
charlatans catering to the credulous
abound. This is the scientific and
rational universe of the Green Party.
Run for the hills.
Syriza’s victory in the Greek
elections in January is the most
important event to take place in
Spain and Greece since the outbreak
of the 2010 Eurozone crisis forced the
re-shuffle of popular left-wing parties.
Syriza was formed in 2004, mainly
from breakaways from the Greek
Communist Party (KKE). The party
gained momentum in 2012 when it
became the second biggest party in
the Greek election, despite a massive
negative publicity campaign by the
international media. With the support
of the wage-earning working classes
and the Greek intelligentsia, Syriza
has a similar electoral base to West
European socialist parties in their
heydays; yet around 2012 it also had
a vibrant ‘movementist’ element far
more comfortable with the spectrum
of radical currents than traditional
parties of the Left.
Syriza is clearly a party with
significant internal divides. Though
this has been in many ways one of
their greatest assets, it may now
prove infelicitous. In 2013, Syriza
merged from a coalition into a unitary
party in a process that centralised
power around the pugnacious but
economically moderate leader Alexis
Tsipras, yet simultaneously increased
the influence of the Left Platform (LP),
going from 25% to 30% of seats won on
Syriza’s central committee.
The central difference in policy
between Tsipras (and the Syrizian
right) and the LP is on the issue of
Greek exit from the Euro (‘Grexit’).
The former are unequivocally against
Grexit: the most blunt opponent,
Yiannis Stathakis, may become
Economics Minister, while the more
nuanced views of the party’s foremost
economics spokesman, Yiannis
Dragasakis, do not change this essential
antinomy. Whatever the relative
merits of the monetary union, I find
it hard to see how a party essentially
identified for its anti-austerity position
will avoid betraying its voters and the
EU, International Monetary Fund,
and European Central Bank enforced
austerity. Symptomatically, there is a
conspicuous absence of any advance
programme of action detailed by the
leadership. This can hardly be said of
the LP; currently led by Panagiotis
Lafazanis, the LP have a detailed

program for Grexit.
Faced by an intellectually superior
internal opposition, it will be curious
to see how Tsipras reacts to the new
conditions of power. The progress of
the coalition with the populist right-
wing party Independent Greeks is as
yet unclear, though possibly motivated
on Tsipras’ part by a desire to undercut
internal Left opposition. However,
despite a negative elective affinity
between Independent Greeks and the
LP, economically it seems reasonable
to assume that an anti-immigrant
party may well prove hostile to the
Euro. The choice could of course
have been motivated by the dearth
of appropriate coalition partners,
with neo-fascist Golden Dawn, lately
incumbent New Democracy, and the
nominally Left PASOK all excluded
from consideration. Independent
Greeks, though, remain a volatile
factor. Still, this piece is not a proleptic
for Syriza’s inevitable failure.
Gramsci said to accompany the
pessimism of the intellect with the
‘optimism of the will’. The Greek
people understood; let us hope Syriza
does also.
