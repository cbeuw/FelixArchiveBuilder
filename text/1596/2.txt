In this week’s issue, we are covering
the recent arguments surrounding
the Counter Terrorism and
Security Bill, that was read in the
House of Lords for the second time
earlier this week.
There has been a lot of
condemnation over the bill, saying
it hinders free speech and stops
students debating topics that need
to be challenged. It also has been
criticised for the pressure it puts on
institutions to monitor its students
and report them for behavioural
patterns that aren’t even specified in
the bill.
Universities do have a
responsibility to ensure their
students debate and discuss
controversial ideas, but they also
have a responsibility to ensure their
students graduate as well-rounded,
considerate members of society.
Although this is obviously easier
said than done, the university needs
to at least provide an environment
that nurtures free speech and
freethinking. It also needs to provide
one that doesn’t allow students to
shrink away into isolation, and be
drawn in to dangerous propaganda
that can encourage those who are
most vulnerable to find solace in
groups and organisations that are
violent and threatening.
It is difficult to quantify elements
such as these, and even more
problematic trying to find solutions
to issues that aren’t really understood
in the first place. The bill, based on
previous legislation that was hastily
pulled together in response to a very
shocking but also very real threat,
needs to be thought through more
carefully. Consulting universities
about what they think is a step in the
right direction, but more should be
done.
With the press very much still
focusing on acts of terrorism,
and with people looking to the
government to shield and protect our
communities, it is easy to see why
these bills are in such demand.
However, unless more consultation
is put into these documents, they
may end up doing more damage than
good.
What’s on this week:
The Union Council
Tuesday 10th February
6pm until we get bored and
go home
Come one, come all to the
great debate of at least
next week. It is going to be
mental.
We are going to talk about
fossil fuels, terrorism,
tampons and how Chris
always contributes to
student media when
appropriate.
