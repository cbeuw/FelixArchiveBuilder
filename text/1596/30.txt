30 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX
HANGMAN hangman@imperial.ac.uk
Graduates remain unemployed due to commenting on stories
online four years ago
After several requests this week
to remove material left by
the students of yesteryear
on our website, Hangman decided
to investigate just what effect these
comments may have had on their
future employment chances.
With several alumni and older
students asking for their work to be
made anonymous, or for comments
attributed to their name to be
removed, Hangman decided to really
find out if employers do indeed give
a shit about what you get up to on the
internet.
We spoke to one employer of a
large, faceless corporation that either
consults on or sells products, about
the hundreds of recruits they take on
each year. One line manager told us
that they had indeed seen a comment
left four years previously on a dry,
mistake-riddled article about the
gaming industry. The comment
called the author a “Tosser lol.”
The line manager confirmed that
the candidate, now a postgraduate
and in possession of two degrees,
three summers’ worth of internship
experience and the ability to code
computers whilst blindfolded,
wasn’t considered as a result of the
comment. Said the manager: “Yeah,
we interviewed the postgraduate and
everything, and they made it into the
final two.
“The other candidate had
fortunately never even owned a
twitter account, let alone commented
such mundane insults on a University
website, so we decided to hire them
instead.”
Another employer, who runs a
large pharmaceutical company, also
said they had googled their final
two candidates for their well-paid
grad scheme. They confirmed they
had read an article written by one
Imperial graduate about the Green
Party, written around three years ago,
who had also made it into the final
stage of recruitment.
Said the employer: “It was a tough
one. The article wasn’t particularly
opinionated, and, to be honest,
although the grammar and spelling
was fine it didn’t really actually
make a definitive point, which can
be expected of a comment piece in a
student newspaper.”
“However, the other candidate,
although lacking any laboratory
abilities and also because they were
illiterate had never, ever, voiced
any opinion on any online medium
ever, so he just seemed like the safer
choice.”
Finally, Hangman spoke to a
recruitment agency that recruits
people to then recruit other people
for other jobs, about those they had
planned to recruit in the first place.
Again, the recruiter said, it had
come down to two candidates,
one from Imperial who had once
commented on an article two

Students and staff alike were left
confused and dazed after reading
last week’s issue of Felix, covering an
independent survey ran to find the
cost of living for final year medical
students.
The article went into detail about
the reduction in funding those in
final year can expect, and also how a
jam-packed timetable means many
can’t work part time jobs too.
However, the article was printed
only days after another piece covering
a medic sports team smashing a coach
window and being suspended.
As a result, many readers were
unable to come to a conclusion as to
whether or not the paper loved or
hated medical students, or, because
the later article didn’t highlight
the strains of students who are not
medics, whether or not the paper
hated all students equally anyway.
One student, reading the paper in
the library café as tuna mayo dripped
down his chin, spoke to Hangman
about his confusion. “I just don’t get
it, why would a paper print articles
that are simply at odds in what they
are saying?
“Like, they say in the Coachgate
Version 2.0 article that all medical
students are absolute vile pigs that
can’t be trusted to be within two feet
of a vehicle.”
“But then, they say in the other
piece that medics are poor little
struggling souls that deserve
sympathy.”
“Hm, I think Felix must simply flip
a coin, and use that to decide whether
or not to bully or worship medical
students in that week’s issue.”
When Hangman pointed out that
the pieces were just news articles, and
didn’t really say any of the above, the
student swallowed his soggy jacket
potato bite and thought for a second.
He continued: “Yeah, but like, it’s a
years previously, and one who was
currently in a coma after being hit by
a bus.
The article, although slightly
controversial but attributed to
another student author, came up too
when searching the candidates name,
although the comment they had left
had simply read: “I neither agree or
disagree with this sentiment, but will
register my interest into this piece
by simply commenting using my full
student newspaper isn’t it? It should
really focus on reporting on students
doing good and stuff, you know, for
most of content. ”
A senior member of the faculty of
medicine, sitting in SAF on the sofas
under the stairs, was more resolute.
“That article about them broken
windows and stuff was terrible. Why
would Felix report on that? It’s just
giving us a bad name.
“Ah well, it’s a fucking rag anyway,
and no-one reads it.”
Hangman pointed out that maybe
the bad behaviour by the small group
of students was what contributed
to any sort of poor reputation.
Hangman also suggested that student
readership would recognise that
not all medics go around puking on
seats or allegedly shaking children in
bowling alleys.
The guy shrugged, and continued,
whilst waving his stethoscope in a
haphazard manner and chugging
down a snakebite despite it being 9am

name.”
“Yeah, we weren’t sure,” said
the recruiter, shaking his head.
“Although we like candidates with
a personality, outside interests,
and, quite frankly, the absolute
essential ability to know how to use
a computer, those that comment on
websites just don’t do it for us.
“I mean, obviously we could tell
the article wasn’t written by the
candidate, but their name was on
the same page, and for us, that is a
deal breaker.” The candidate who is
comatose took up the role instead,
although is simply wheeled up to the
computer table each day and stares
lifelessly at the screen.
The recruiter shrugged, “Yeah, the
other candidate basically can’t do
the job at all, but how could be ever
possibly hire a graduate who once
dared to contribute to student media?
We could have been sued.”
Felix Online: the website at the centre of all the controversy
on a Tuesday morning.
“I just think that the paper should
be supporting the student body, so
shouldn’t actually bother with news,
to be honest, unless it is about how
great the School of Medicine.”
“Although saying that, that jihad
orgy story was hilarious.”
