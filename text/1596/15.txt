Slender: The Eight Pages was the
first horror game I played. I
remember seeing many videos
of the game before I played it and
thinking this doesn’t look that scary,
so ignorantly I downloaded the free
indie game and began to play.
The game sees your character
alone in a dark forest searching for
eight pieces of paper which appear
in random locations around a map.
Armed only with your torch you must
collect these pages while being stalked
by the Slenderman, a tall skinny
man wearing a suit with no facial
features. It sounds easy, and thats
what I thought, but I soon realised
that what makes this game hard is
that it terrifies me every time I play
it. The game is very simple but the
atmosphere created by the creepy
dissonant piano music, the sounds
of the forest and footsteps when
you aren’t walking make you very
aware that you are being stalked. To
add to this every time you collect a
page the rhythmic beating you hear
in the game gets faster and indeed
Slenderman get’s faster too. He even
has the ability to teleport! The most
scary thing about this game is that
the way Slenderman takes you is by
you looking at him too long. It’s very
hard to walk around alone in this
dark forest without wanting to look
behind you and when you do and see
him you can’t help but jump and lose
those precious seconds you need to
escape. He doesn’t move when you
look at him but the screen becomes
full of static. Run a bit forward and
then check behind you again and
he will have moved much closer to
you. The only way to beat the game
is to be fearless and never look back,
something that took me a while to
master and even now he still scares
me.
It is with some amount of bravery
that I then bought the second, longer
Slender game, Slender: The Arrival. The
first thing I noticed about this game
is that the world really is beautiful.
You start out in a forest in gorgeous
sunshine, and you can’t help but feel
safe. Instantly you are aware of all
the controls, mainly clicking and
walking and you are free to enjoy
the scenery. For some reason your
character is holding a camcorder
(much like in Outlast but without the
night vision) but this can be turned
off for true immersion in the world.
As you progress further from the
safety of your car and further into
the forest the game makes you feel
The games section here at Felix
periodically get free games in
to review. In the past, these
have included such greats as Euro
Bus Simulator 2 (see my past review).
While these simulator games are fun
to review I was very pleased when the
opportunity arose to play upcoming
PSVita game Baboon, as puzzle games
are something I know more about.
The game did not disappoint and I
hope that this review will reveal why.
Baboon is a game from spanish
indie developers Relevo. You play
as a monkey who must collect the
bananas that the evil Pirate monkey
has made float up into the sky.
To do this you must light and set
off bombs under yourself which
propel you into the sky. You can
fine tune your flight by selecting
the strength of the bomb and
also the position. The strength is
selected using a meter which goes
up and down, and you must time
your launch carefully to attain
the required speed. Likewise you
must place the bomb carefully so
that you fly through the air on the
proper trajectory. It is this simple
main game mechanic that could be
learnt in seconds and take hours
to master that makes the game so
addictive. I like to think of it as a
mixture between golf, Angry Birds
and Tiddlywinks. Flying yourself
through the air sounds easy but, you
must avoid enemies, collect bananas
and do so in a time limit or with
various other challenges if you are
going for 100%.
As you progress you get more
items and are able to complete more
complex levels which helps to keep
the game fresh and interesting. In
addition to these fun puzzle levels,
of which some are very challenging
and rewarding to complete, is a fun
background story where you can
speak to the other monkeys, and
trade items in order to unlock more
items for yourself. Sometimes after
completing a particularly hard level
it is relaxing to partake in these side
quests.
Overall Baboon is a very solid
game. It is fun, has a lovely Japanese
art style and a great soundtrack. The
levels are simple, varied enough and
offer enough challenge to keep even
seasoned platformers coming back
to it.
If the levels prove too hard at first
you can spend time chatting with
the other monkeys and spend your
hard earned bananas on power up
items to help you.
The short nature of the levels
makes this the perfect game to play
on a commute to work and I would
recommend that everyone starts
playing this and not Candy Crush or
Angry Birds!
uneasy. Is someone watching you? By
the time you reach your friends house
you suddenly realise, the game has
progressed to night seamlessly. Slender
at night is still a beautiful game but I
couldn’t help but be terrified.
A lot of this game takes place
much like the original, there is a
find-eight-pages level and a turn-on-
six-generators level but the random
placements of these items and the
different levels in which you must
complete these objectives does make
this game fun to play and replay.
There are a few well planned jump
scares but overall it is the atmosphere
of this game and the fact that you
must constantly keep moving which
makes this game terrifying and
exciting.
The game is short but the variety of
levels and items to collect make it good
value for money. In contrast to the
scary nature of the game, the Steam
achievements offer some humour,
such as the achievement for using the
playground slide in the first level and
acknowledging that when Slenderman
is in sight you are unable to pause the
game which makes fun of your frantic
attempts to pause the game to escape
him.
Overall Slender: The Arrival is a good
scenic short horror game that should
belong in your game collection if you
are brave enough.
It started my love of Horror games
and I have now played (among others)
Outlast, Amnesia and Alien Isolation,
but nothing amounts to the terror I
feel for Slendy. This game may stop
any dreams you have of living on a
farm or ever going into a forest but it
will provide you with adrenaline like
no other game. I know.
"Slender

is still a

game but
I couldn’t
help but be
terrified. "
