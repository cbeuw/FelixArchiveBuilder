about 3 million farmers produce
enough grain to feed 2 billion
people.
Despite the millions that these
yield increases have the potential
to feed, there are still 805 million
people malnourished in the world
today, according to the World Food
Programme. Our gluttonous desires
place huge demand on energy
inefficient foods such as meat. The
majority of grain produced is used
for livestock, reducing the resources
for nourishing people. With the
absence of meat consumption it is
estimated that an additional billion
people could be fed.
It is not economically viable to
grow crops to feed animals for later
consumption by humans, effectively
wasting about 90% of the energy
through this additional step in the
food chain. 70% of the grain we
produce is used to feed livestock.
Of this grain 16 times more is
consumed by cattle compared to the
meat that they provide.
It is effectively a food factory
working in reverse. Energy is
required to process livestock, despite
the energy that has already been
used to process the grain that they
eat. Nonetheless, the global demand
for meat is increasing, especially in
developing countries. Consumption
of meat in China for example has
quadrupled in the last 30 years. In
the US, the average person consumes
50% more protein than the daily
recommended allowance. The
consequence is that crops are used
to feed livestock and not humans.
How can this be justified when
hunger kills more people every year
than Aids, Malaria and Tuberculosis
combined?
The energy inefficiency of
livestock consumption is not its
only undesirable trait. Staggering
amounts of water are required for
livestock production. 13,000 litres
of water are used to produce 1 kg of
beef, compared to 100 litres used to
produce 1 kg of potatoes.
In addition, livestock production
is exhaustive of huge areas of
land. 94% more land is required
to produce livestock than for
crop production. This means
more pesticide and fertiliser used
compared to merely farming crops
for direct human consumption.
The amount of energy needed
to raise livestock, to produce
petrochemicals as well as for storage
and transportation makes “cows
more damaging than cars” in terms
of our global footprint; says the
Head of Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change.
Monocultures – dull and
dangerous
By creating monocultures of
domesticated plants and animals we
are pushing out biodiversity created
by millions of years of evolution
for our own ends. With denial
and absence of action will only
come starvation and the currently
practiced agricultural methods
cannot be sustained.
However pessimism does not
allow development. Things can and
are being done. Wheat crop plants
are being genetically engineered,
for instance, so that they are able
to fix nitrogen, making fertilisers
unnecessary. Biological means of
pest control can be a sustainable
alternative and tighter regulations
on pesticides are being issued.
Reduction in meat production will
significantly increase agricultural
sustainability. Alternative protein
sources such as legumes and
chickpeas can provide a good meat
substitute and many more are being
developed. Even a small reduction
in the amount of meat consumed
by individuals will have long
lasting beneficial effects making
agriculture more sustainable. Less
land would be required for the same
net energy gain, which would lead
to a reduction in greenhouse gas
emissions and water use, as well as
a greater percentage of the valuable
nutrients being used directly for
human consumption.		
			
Food for thought
Thomas Robert Malthus prophesied
famine as population increase
outstripped food supply in the 17th
century. This has not yet become
reality as Malthus did not foresee
the increase in yields due to
technological advancement. But how
much longer will the earth be able to
provide subsistence for mankind if
we are not willing to compromise?
No matter how far apart we
believe we can set ourselves from
nature, our reliance on it cannot be
disputed. Rather than disrupting
nature’s balance, agriculture needs
to be integrated within it allowing
for sustainability and to feed an ever
increasing population.
“The [new]
epoch has
allowed
machines
to replace
men.”
“Rather than
disrupting
nature’s
balance,
agriculture
needs to be
integrated
within it.”
Planes spraying pesticides onto fields. Pretty neat way of doing it, but how sustainable are these large-scale intensive agricultural practices? Photo credit: imgkid.com
