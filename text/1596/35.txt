the other side for perhaps another
society, perhaps Islamic Society.
The second one is on feminism, so
we might open up the other side for
Feminist society to bring in a speaker.
It’s an open mic event, so we’ll try and
encourage audience participation.
The third one is on privacy vs.
security. So these are the three events
planned for GIAG.
B: You mentioned some other uni
philosophy societies?
Ab: We’re starting up – the best way
to gain strength is to collaborate
with other people. So far we’ve been
to the UCL philosophy society. They
had a talk recently, so the Chair and
myself went there, we invited their
speaker over to Imperial, so we have
Professor Schofield, who might join
us next term, who’s a utilitarian. So
just to open avenues of collaboration,
do joint events with UCL, steal their
speakers, that sort of thing.
This Friday was Kings College
London – they had a philosophy
event, so I went for that. It’s the same
thing, just to make ties with other
universities. And they were quite
enthusiastic – all these universities
were interested in doing a big event
with all the societies. So that would
give us strength.
B: That’d be exciting! What else
have you got on the horizon?
Am: We want to start small, with pub
evenings. So we’ll also do casual, just
getting together, having drinks and
talking about philosophy.
Ab: Drinks and Debates! That’s the
catchphrase we’re using, anyway!
Am: And afterwards, we’ll have the
speaker series. It’ll be interesting to
have the most exciting brains coming
to Imperial to speak.
Ab: Speakers are interesting. So like
Amelia said, we’ll start small, we’ll ask
the Horizons lecturer (who’s a pretty
distinguished philosopher himself),
and Professor Schofield has agreed
to come and speak. We thought
perhaps Philosophy of Science might
be something that Imperial students
might find more interesting than
ethics or politics, so we might start
with that.
Eventually, we are looking to get big
speakers. There’s no point speculating
now, but I think that’s the biggest
thing we’re dreaming for, to get
someone like Noam Chomsky – that’s
our Chair’s dream.
B: Do you think there are
philosophers at Imperial?
Obviously, we’re all scientists.
Ab: Well, science did used to be called
natural philosophy!
Am: We think there are. Also if there
are people who have, for example, an
idea of God or not God, if you just
have meaning, you can come to the
society, and we’ll talk about it!
Ab: We have so many religious
societies – that’s an area of
“To get
someone
like Noam
Chomsky
– that’s
our Chair’s
dream”
philosophy.
Am: Everybody has a philosophy,
even if they don’t know it, even
scientists!
B: Are you guys planning anything
with the religious societies?
Ab: We are. I mean, the goal right
now is to be at least a little bit
controversial.
B: It doesn’t count if you don’t
offend someone?
Ab: The main thing is that... We have
a debating soc, public speaking soc, so
we need to distinguish ourselves by
making the issue philosophical, not
political or religious.
But free speech is not about what
should the government do – it’s
about the philosophy behind it, the
principles. Do we have certain rights?
Are we born with certain rights?
Those are the questions we’re trying
to answer.
B: What’s your membership
like? Are you mostly undergrads,
postgrads, medics?
Am: We want to have a mix, actually,
so that everybody can come.
B: I have a couple of fun questions.
First one: stranded on a desert
island, and you can only take three
things with you.
Ab: Are we speaking as members
“Everybody
has a
philosophy
... even
scientists!”
of SocSoc, in which case I should
say Nietzsche, or would that be too
pretentious? I like to write, I’d take a
notebook (and a pen, obviously).
Am: Well, we can do the pen
ourselves, can’t we?
Ab: What would you take?
Am: So first, one friend. So that we
can discuss some things. The second
would be a notebook. Let’s take a
notebook, a friend... and something
to eat.
Ab: Isn’t that all you need in life?
Am: And a bottle of champagne!
Forget the food.
B: And your favourite philosopher?
Your personal one.
Am: I really like Montaigne.
Ab: I love Nietzsche. I’m just that
kind of person, don’t judge me. People
burst into laughter when I mention
Nietzsche. I was at KCL, and they’re
very against continental philosophy,
from what I’ve heard. I mentioned
Nietzsche and almost got kicked
out... Nietzsche was controversial,
but you shouldn’t be afraid to be
controversial.
B: Anything else you want to say?
Ab: I want to say that everyone should
join now while membership is free,
because we are going to start changing
for it! Right now it’s free and you
should join.
B: Great, thanks guys!
Starting a new club at Imperial
Imperial College Union boasts over
340 societies,and that number
grows every month,with new
societies proposed including Wine
Tasting,Airsoft and three different
applications for weightlifting
societies.
The creation of new clubs,
societies and projects is run by
the New Activities Committee
(NAC),a subcommittee of the
Clubs,Societies and Projects
Board (CSPB).This is chaired
by the Deputy President (Clubs
& Societies) (DPCS),and also
includes some of the experienced
volunteers holding roles in club
management.
If you have an idea for a new
club,the first step is to find other
people who are interested.You
only need three people to begin
the process (and only two for a
project).Once you’ve got together,
and decided who’s going to be the
President,Treasurer and Secretary
(and any other r0les you want to
have) track down the form online
and send it in to the DPCS.
Things to think about when
filling out the form are how to make
your club sustainable, how to get
people to your events,and ways of
funding what you want to do.
Once they’ve seen the application,
the NAC will decide whether to
make you a new club or put you into
the New Clubs Incubator–which
allows you to run activities with a bit
more support from the DPCS.Once
you’ve run a few events and become
sustainable,the NAC can make you
into a new club,and assign the club
to one of Imperial’s Management
Groups.
