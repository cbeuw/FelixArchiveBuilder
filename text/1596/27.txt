Fred Fyles is amazed by this painter’s long-awaited retrospective
Marlene Dumas: The image as triumph
“Art is not a mirror.
Art is a translation of that which you
do not know”
– Marlene Dumas
The earliest piece of figurative
art in the world, the Venus of
Hohle Fels dates from 40,000
years ago. In the years between then
and now we have had Ingres’ bathers,
Delecroix’s Liberty, and Moore’s
voluptuous granite blocks; surely
there is no angle left from which the
human body has not been explored
and depicted. The Tate Modern’s
latest exhibition, Marlene Dumas: The
Image as Burden, shatters this idea, as
Dumas’ provocative, revolutionary
portraits return the human figure to
the centre of art.
Using photographs as her primary
image, Dumas explores the very limits
of the human form; in her Rejects
series, comprised of cast-offs from
some of her earlier works, human
faces seem made up of mere smoke.
Nebulous and sinister, this ongoing
series of 48 portraits assaults you with
their intensity. Her first portraits,
completed in 1975 whilst studying
in her native South Africa, already
display this signature style; they see
portraiture as a form of emotional
exorcism, a purging of raw emotions,
resulting in a psychologically
complex body of work comparable to
Francis Bacon.
Death stalks through the galleries
here, emerging from many of
Dumas’ works; in some, such as the
portraits of dead women, death is
immediately present, but in others
one must scratch beneath the surface,
only to see the reaper staring back
at you. From her first major show in
1985, The Eyes of the Night Creatures,
we are shown a portrait of her late
grandmother. Surrounded with a
pale blue, the figure seems to dissolve
into the background, her benevolent
expression offset with a sense of
unease at the smudges and drips that
cover the painting like ectoplasm.
Within Dumas work there is a
melding of the sexual and the morbid,
calling to mind Freud’s death drive –
that desire to return to the inorganic.
This is most obvious in the last room
of the exhibition; upon entering, the
entire right wall is taken up with three
closely cropped portraits of women.
With their heads thrown back, it is
easy to think that they are reclining
in St Teresa-esque ecstasy; the
description lets us know that Dumas
took as her source material pictures of
three dead women, a revelation that
hits us square in the gut.
Although Dumas has made
Amsterdam her home in the mid-70s,
her South African roots have driven
her work, which is intrinsically
political. By breaking down the
tradition of figurative painting,
Dumas raises questions about gender,
sexuality, and – most importantly
– race. The theme of ethnicity is
one that occurs again and again in
Dumas’ paintings. In the early 1990s
she began challenging the tradition
of ethnographic photography, which
often saw black people as mere bodies
instead of people; using these photos
as a source material, she restores the
subjects’ humanity, subverting the
very practice.
Elsewhere, she contrasts black
bodies with white, whether this is by
simply switching the colour round on
paintings of her infant daughter, or
in her work The White Disease, which
interprets medical photography to
directly oppose the Apartheid idea of
the ‘Black Problem’. Dumas looks at
the line where pain becomes beauty,
where horror and delight merge
together, in a Dionysian whirlwind of
emotion.
Her wide-ranging series Magdalenas,
which was included in her collection
for the Dutch Pavillion in the 1995
Venice Biennale, takes the female
body as a starting point, but veers
down a much more interesting
path. The entire range of women’s
bodies are taken on by Dumas’
gaze – cherubic, Rubenesque nudes,
resplendent in their fleshiness; and
thin, angular black women, their hair
covering their breasts; Dumas knows
there is no point in trying to sum up
the full range of women’s humanity
within a single painting, and so
extends her reach so wide as to take
on numerous archetypes.
Dumas uses the female form in
a variety of ways: in her Delecroix-
referencing The Woman of Algiers, she
reproduces a newspaper photograph
of a Algerian prisoner captured by
French forces, including the black
bars covering her breasts and genitals;
her Biennale piece Great Britain
1995-7 contrasts two British icons
of femininity, Naomi Campbell
and Princess Diana, to explore how
representation is intrinsically linked
to class and race; and in The Widow,
Pauline Lumumba bears her breasts
in resolute agony as she walks the
streets of Leopoldville, mourning
her murdered husband. While these
women are used to raise questions
of politics, their autonomy is not
destroyed – they are never seen as
tools in Dumas’ arsenal, but living
breathing expressions of femininity.
And it is this that is one of the most
interesting aspects of Dumas’ work:
her obsession with the female form
and the historical place of women,
but also her refusal to allow this to
constrain her. She is not a ‘niche’
painter; not a ‘woman’ painter; she is
simply a painter of humanity, who
allows the inner life of her subjects
to shine through. This is reflected in
what she has to say about the role of
women in art history:
“Historically painting was seen
as female, but the males were the
painters, and the females the models.
Now the female takes the main
role. She paints herself. The model
becomes the artist. She created
herself. She is not there to please you.
She pleases herself. The question is
not ‘Who is she’, but ‘Who are you?’”
Dumas stares directly through the
history of Western art, and questions
its very foundations.
One of the most arresting of
Dumas’ paintings is her portrait of
her daughter Helena. Entitled The
Painter, the original polaroid showed
her daughter standing in the garden,
splattered with paint. In the painting,
she appears as a ghostly apparition,
her skin paper-white and her feet
blurring into the background. The
paint on her hands remains, jumping
out at us in blood-red. Ominous, yet
strangely placid, it is perhaps this
image, which Dumas described as
exploring the “cruelty and magic
of innocence” that best reflects her
extensive body of work.
Throughout the exhibition, we are
presented with quotes from Dumas,
along with some of her (excellent)
poetry. What comes across most
strongly is her sense of uncertainty
– the word maybe crops up again and
again and at one point she doubts
her abilities: “sometimes I think
I’m not a real artist, because I am
too half hearted; and I never quite
know where I am”. This retrospective
leaves nothing in doubt; Dumas is
most certainly a real artist. With her
ability to transcend the limits of the
paint and canvas, her innate sense for
pain and beauty, and her uncanny
psychological insight, Marlene
Dumas is perhaps the most vital artist
we have today.
