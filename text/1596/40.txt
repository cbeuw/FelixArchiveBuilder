“I want a win in this game more than any other”
This week, the best (annual)
sporting event kicks off
with the Six Nations, with a
mouth-watering Wales vs England
game under the Friday night lights
in Cardiff tonight. With England and
Wales in the same World Cup group
later this year the game is steeped in
significance.
England have, for the last ten years,
been the nearly men in the Six, while
Wales have excelled. The last time
England arrived at the Millennium
Stadium, they had a Grand Slam
on the table and were thoroughly
stuffed by 30 points to 3. Last year
at Twickenham, England recorded a
respectable victory of 29 points to 18.
Make no mistake, the recent history
between the two sides shows that
neither holds a decisive advantage,
and that the rub of the green and the
venue can make all the difference.
Wales, in what some have called a
thinly veiled attempt at mind-games,
named their squad a couple of days
early. It is such a settled squad that
there are just two changes from the
2014 starting XV and only three from
2013. This contrasts with England
who have at least five probable
starters out injured, and nine changes
from the 2014 XV. The most striking
of these changes has to be in the
centres, where the pairing of Roberts
and Davies has started this fixture
since 2011. Expect Roberts to run
some hard lines at George Ford in the
10 channel.
This is so different to England,
where six months from the start of a
home Rugby World Cup not even the
coaches know what the best centre
pairing is. Tonight, Luther Burrell
will start in his favoured 12 shirt,
with Jonathan Joseph outside him at
13. Joseph has been in sparkling form
this year, along with the whole Bath
back line, and delivered a stunning
performance against Toulouse in the
revamped European Champions Cup
to ensure that even without an injury
to Manu Tuilagi he would have been
right in the mix for the 13 shirt.
The last two games between these
sides have seen the balance of power
up front swing either way. In Cardiff
in 2013 England got on the wrong
side of Steve Walsh up front, while
in Twickenham the following year
Wales rubbed Romain Poite up the
wrong way so badly that Gethin
Jenkins was sent to the naughty step
for ten minutes after 53 minutes.
Expect a massive battle up front,
with both packs trying to lay down
a marker for the impending World
Cup.
Immortals win on Super
Bowl Sunday
Sunday 1st February saw the
Immortals take a trip to the seaside
to face Brighton Tsunami for the
second time in the season.The first
time saw the Immortals dominate
with a 12-6 win at home.The team
all packed onto the coach at 8am
for the two-hour drive to Brighton;
looking ready to take the second,
and most important,win of the
season.This game was the most
important in the Immortals’season
because it almost certainly decided
who would be relegated from the
Premiership South division.
The game started well with strong
running from Emanuel Olagbaju
and Rayane Jackson as well as
good blocking from the offensive
line,something that would
become a theme throughout the
match.However,unfortunately
something else that would become
a theme was the Immortals
offense struggling to finish their
long drives down the pitch with a
touchdown.
The Immortals defense looked
as strong as ever putting huge
pressure on the quarterback with
Jack Cordrey getting an impressive
sack as well as Jorn getting his
hand on their signal-caller.Bob
Worksfromhomealone laid down
a huge hit on their quarterback
taking him out of the game in the
second half.The offense made
things difficult for themselves
with copious penalties on the day
taking away two touchdowns and
extending their driving distance.
The only points scored in the
match were a safety,scoring 2
points,because Brighton’s punter
managed to punt the ball out
of the back of his own endzone
when strong winds took the ball.
Having said that the Immortals
should have put up more points
considering the offensive pressure
and the defensive domination-
discipline was lacking on the day,
which made the match closer than
it deserved to be.
The Most Valuable Players (MVP)
of the day were: Jorn Jorg (Overall
MVP for solid work put in on
offence and defense),Henry‘has
a big head’Turner (Offensive MVP
for strong blocking on the line),
Little Harry Collini (Line MVP for
putting in big blocks on offensive
line and dominating on defensive
line) and Panukorn‘Teddy’
Taleongpongdong (Defensive MVP
for an overall great performance
on defense).
After winning the game,the team
went on to host the Superbowl
party at the Union,which was a
successful and entertaining night
that saw the New England Patriots
defeat the Seattle Seahawks 28-24
in amazing circumstances.Now
the team looks forward to playing
Hertfordshire on Sunday 8th
February and ACC on Wednesday
4th February where the James
Alden award will continue to be
fought for.

The old saying “I support Wales,
and anyone playing England” is
massively overplayed. Wales are more
than good enough to not obsess over
the England game, but there is always
a certain spice to the occasion. As an
England supporter I am not ashamed
to say I want a win in this game more
than any other in the tournament.
We might be in more diverse days,
with many Welsh players plying their
trade this side of the Severn Bridge or
earning the big bucks in France, but
this game is still hugely important. In
the excellent autobiography (Proud)
of Gareth Thomas you read about
Lawrence Dallaglio banging on the
Wales dressing room door shouting
“You’ve been dicked” after Wales
suffered a 60 point loss. Just try and
say this game doesn’t matter to the
players.
Whatever happens this evening,
I hope that we get to appreciate a
fantastic game of rugby.
In Wales vs England we have the
biggest rivalry in the Northern
Hemisphere, and while it is so easy
to read so much into every incident
this Six Nations, with the World Cup
around the corner, we cannot forget
that this is a fantastic tournament in
itself and a fantastic game to show off
this tournament.
