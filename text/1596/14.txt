All-nighters might not be such a good idea
It’s coming up to that time of year
again where a lot of us start to
panic and furiously try to catch
up with all the lectures we’ve been
procrastinating in since last October.
However, is pulling all-nighters for
the last few weeks leading up to exams
really worth our while?
Researchers from Brandeis
University in the United States
have recently illustrated a new
perspective on our understanding
of the relationship between sleep
and memory consolidation, arguing
for a significant role of inhibitory
neurotransmission in regulating
these processes.
Sleep, which is defined
behaviourally by the normal
suspension of consciousness and
electrophysiologically by specific
brain wave criteria, consumes a
whopping third of our lives! So is it
any wonder that we’ve known for a
long time now that sleep, memory
and learning are deeply connected?
Previous studies have shown that
when animals such as mice – and
even humans! – are sleep deprived,
they tend to experience a lapse in
their memory.
More recent research has shed
light on the fact that sleep is critical
in converting short-term memories
to long-term memories, a process
known as memory consolidation.
However, we are as yet unsure of the
details of how this works.
Are memories reinforced because
during sleep, our brain has more
time to ‘replay’ all the events of the
day and filter out the unwanted
memories from the wanted ones, or
are ‘memory neurons’ in the brain
the reason why we feel sleepy in the
first place?
Paula Haynes and Bethany
Christmann, of Brandeis University,
led a project that studied well-known
memory consolidator neurones in the
fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster,
called dorsal paired medial (DPM)
neurons and examined how these
interacted with wakefulness-
promoting neurones, called
mushroom body (MB) neurons. The
mushroom body is a section in the
Drosophila brain where memories
are stored.
Interestingly, they found that
when the DPM neurons were
activated, they released an inhibitory
neurotransmitter called GABA which
decreased the activity of the MB
neurons, making the flies sleep more.
When this system was deactivated
by downregulating two of the MB
neurons’ receptor subtypes (the
GABAA
and GABAB
R3), there was
increased loss of sleep in the flies.
This intimate regulation of
sleep by neurons necessary for
memory consolidation suggests
that these brain processes may be
functionally interrelated through
their shared anatomy. These memory
consolidation neurons inhibited
the drive for wakefulness as the
conversion of short-term to long-
term memory commenced.
Bethany Christmann, co-author
of the study which was published
in the journal eLife, explained that
“It’s almost as if that section of the
mushroom body were [initially]
saying ‘hey, stay awake and learn
this’ ... then, after a while, the DPM
neurons start signalling to suppress
that section, as if to say ‘you’re going
to need sleep if you want to remember
this later’”.

implications for understanding
the relationship between sleep
and memory consolidation, by
supporting the role played by
inhibitory neurotransmission in the
regulation of these processes. Further
development of our understanding
of the relationship between sleep
and memory in a simple system such
as the fruit fly may hopefully take
us a step closer to unravelling the
complex mechanisms behind sleep
and memory in the human brain.
Christmann also mentioned how this
research could “help us figure out
how sleep or memory is affected when
things go wrong, as in the case of
insomnia or memory disorders”.
In the meantime, if you want to ace
that paper tomorrow, put down that
can of Red Bull and hit the sack!
