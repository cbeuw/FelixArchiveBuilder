Eradication: The Extreme of Experimental
In the eerie Council Chamber
of Battersea Arts Centre, a
partition has been raised between
the two halves of the room. With half
the audience on one side and half on
the other, two different plays are on
show. In what feels like a set botched
together from bits and pieces, the
audience wait to find out which of
tonight’s two performances they
will see. Into the space walk the four
actors; one sits down in front of us
and the other three pass through the
small opening to the other half of
the audience. Although we can hear
what is going on on the other side,
their actions can only be left to the
imagination.
The Eradication of Schizophrenia
in Western Lapland falls somewhere
in the realms of what can only
be considered the extreme of
experimental theatre. An exploration
of the nature of psychosis, this
incredibly powerful, thought
provoking and deeply uncomfortable
play is unlike anything I have seen
before. On one side of the dividing
wall we find scenes from a mother’s
kitchen, and on the other, the
discussions held in a therapist’s
office. Inspired by the open dialogue
method which has almost eradicated
schizophrenia in Finland, the play
probes the uncertainty and confusion
of the audience to highlight the
different perceptions of madness and
the importance of family in tackling
mental illness.
Performed by the Ridiculusmus
Company, known for their work
which bridges both the serious and
funny, this play is branded as a
black comedy. Would I call it that?
Absolutely not; but it says something
about this company that when faced
with such a challenging subject
matter, a need for humour is not a
side thought but a necessity.
The performances in both halves
of the room start simultaneously.
Although separated in time and
space, the small passage through
the partition allows for a transition
of actors from one performance to
the other. However, in changing
performance, the characters
themselves don’t change. The result is
an audience overwhelmed by barrages
of conflicting information about each
of the characters.
What appears to be the archetypal
relationship between therapist and
patient twists and turns, leaving the
audience questioning themselves
and their perceptions as much as
the characters on show. Added to
overheard fragments from across the
partition, the line between reality
and delusion becomes increasingly
blurred. Moments of egomania and
subtle madness are contrasted against
lines referring to the here and now.
Dialogue describing the patient
having written the works of Nabokov
swerves wildly into discussions of
how he was born from the Führer’s
frozen sperm! The therapist reminds
him of the treatment he is obliged
to offer, Clozapine, before we are
reminded of why we are here.
“My colleague and I worked on a
training programme which almost
eradicated Schizophrenia in…”
“Western Lapland. I know, it’s the
name of the play we are in.”
Through the psychosis on show, the
audience are suddenly and brutally
aware of what has been happening. It
is not an illness to display psychosis
but rather the fear of outsiders who
label the strange experiences of
others. This we call schizophrenia,
and throughout the first half the
audience dissect every character’s
actions, deciding who to label sane
and who to label insane.
So, it was in the context of this
extraordinary first half that the
interval arrived, and for the first time
in my experience, no one moved.
Bewildered and confused, even
the house lights coming up saw no
reaction from the audience. If any of
the audience had ever wondered what
it’s like to be really star struck, this
was it. Only when the usher returned

to the auditorium to remind us that
we could get up did anyone start to
take notice.
On comes the second half and the
ushers instruct us to enter the other
half of the auditorium. We are now
seated in front of the mother in her
kitchen and the patient’s brother.
Throughout the first half, the
mother had been painted as a
madwoman. With the tone and
volume of the actors perfected so that
only very particular lines could be
heard, the patient’s descriptions of
his mother’s borderline personality
disorder are only reinforced by the
noises and silhouettes from beyond
the partition.
Now in the second half, the show
restarts the dialogue where it had
been twenty minutes into the first
half. What seemed like madness
when they could only be heard is
now clarified through the details not
visible to the other side. The image
of the family comes across as deeply
dysfunctional, but the mother still
comes across as sane and loving where
previously she appeared to be neither.
It is here that we are reminded for
the second time of the words of the
patient: “The fictional realm helps
you unearth your problems.” As
the show progresses, the audience’s
confusion and unease has left them
desperately trying to solve what is
going on in the characters’ heads.
However, in doing so, assumptions
have been made and stereotypes
have been grasped at which leave the
patient powerless. In the show’s final
moments, the partition is opened and
a moment of family unity reminds
us of what is really important; the
support and love of the people around
you, and an acceptance of uncertainty
when tackling Schizophrenia.
The Eradication of Schizophrenia
in Western Lapland might not be
a classical masterpiece, but it is
extraordinary in its own right. Did I
enjoy the performance? No, but what
it lacked in simple enjoyment it made
up for in the way I was left speechless
at the end. If you’re really the sort of
person who wants a fun, entertaining
evening out, avoid this show like
the plague, but its exploration of
the human psyche is unmatched by
anything I have seen in recent years.
All I can do is stand and cheer at the
incredible work of Ridiculusmus.
We might not have given the cast a
standing ovation on the night, but
when you’ve had your legs swept out
from underneath you, a star struck
round of applause will do.
The Eradication of Schizophrenia in
Western Lapland is at the Battersea Arts
Centre until 14th
February. Tickets £15,
£12 for concessions
