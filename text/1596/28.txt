Viviane Sassen Like Never Before
Kamil McClelland explores Pikin Slee, Sassen’s exhibition at the ICA
Dor Guez — A New Israeli History
Next I go up to Dor Guez’s
exhibition,TheSickManofEurope.
Guez is a fascinating man.Born in
Jerusalem to Christian Palestinian
and Jewish Tunisian parents,he has
been able to experience the Middle
East with a truly unique eye,away
from the prevailing Arab and
Jewish Israeli narratives.Entitling
this exhibition TheSickManof
Europe,Guez is making a comment
on Israel’s profound cultural and
economic malaise,limping just
outside the continent’s borders,all
the while receiving large amounts
of financial support from the West,
unlike any other healthy country.
This gives you a sense of the
Guez’s approach to art–analytical,
reflective,quite comfortable in
commenting about the region’s
tumultuous modern history.
It is this theme that forms the
backdrop of Guez’s first piece of
the exhibition,ThePainter, an
alternative look at the impact of
the 1973 Yom Kippur War on one
artist.Told with great lyricism,this
wonderful piece takes you on an
intensely vivid journey,recounting
the story of a Jewish Tunisian
immigrant who is conscripted as a
reservist into the war,only to suffer
In my opinion, the ICA is simply
not appreciated enough. It is on
the front line of contemporary
art and this means that, although all
shows aren’t guaranteed to thrill (such
is the risk of pushing boundaries!),
you will have an exciting time no
matter what — much better this than
the rather soulless blockbuster shows
of the Tate.
And so I am greeted by Viviane
Sassen’s latest exhibition Pikin
Slee. A true innovator in fashion
photography, Sassen abstracts her
work to create pieces that transcend
all notion of orthodoxy. We last
saw her at The Photographer’s
Gallery, her exhibition Analemma,
which explored her work in art
fashion photography. But her current
exhibition at the ICA represented a
very different body of her work.
In 2013, Sassen travelled to
Suriname, deep into the jungle to a
town where the only outside contact
was via canoe — Pikin Slee. Here, she
documents a world completely alien
to her own, the life of the Saramacca
people, a traditional way of life where
the beauty of nature reigns supreme.
It is not a particularly large
collection of works; the ICA is not
a particularly large venue; but the
exhibition manages to display many
aspects of the beauty of this little
town. From portraits and documents
of the mundane to more abstract
pieces, such as the incredible Warrior,
an anthropomorphic arrangement
of palm fronds that trick the eye into
seeing something that does not exist.
These are the Sassen works that
I love, the ones that completely
reinvent what one might expect
to perceive, whether in fashion
photography or in nature. And
I do not mind her liberal use of
Photoshop. She creates a modernity
and dynamism in images that would
otherwise pass me by.
However, this body of work only
represents a small proportion of what
is displayed. The rest I unfortunately
found less impressive. Yes it was well
shot, well composed, but it didn’t
have that unique Sassen signature
that you see written all over her
fashion photography. Maybe it’s just
me who doesn’t get it but photos of
buckets and puddles just don’t do it
for me!
Would I make a special point of
seeing this display, probably not.
Although it does have moments that
are unlike any other depiction of
rainforest communities I have seen,
much of the rest is less fantastic.
However, if you are going to the Dor
Guez exhibition (read below, it was
excellent!), it may be worth popping
your head in. Otherwise, just stick to
her fashion photography.

parallels to his own life story,Guez
does not lay blame on anyone,
simply weaving a tragic story that

this reappraisal of past events.
I had honestly never heard about
Guez before I researched this show,
his first major UK solo exhibition
created through collaboration with
the Mosaic Rooms.Although small,
the collection of works on display
does leave a great impression of this
young artist,someone whose voice
may become increasingly important
and poignant when commenting on
his country’s present.
This exhibition is all about
storytelling.Whilst this often plays
a role in art exhibitions,it is rarely
as integral as in this display,where
every piece follows on from the last
to paint a matrix of experiences.
And whilst you might argue that
this causes much of the exhibition
to feel thrown together,a cacophony
of influences,once you delve into
it,you feel totally immersed in the
world of Guez’s fictional character.
I feel art always gives such a
unique viewpoint of a situation
and I often turn to it to unearth the
hidden narrative behind a façade.
Never has this been more true than
with Guez.
From his marginalised role
in society,he can interpret a
situation in a new,alternative
light.This process is evident in
ThePainting, where Guez analyses
how storytelling and individual
experience can change,even warp
one’s sense of reality.And even
if this is a fabricated story from a
psychiatrist’s couch,the artist is
analyzing dangerously poignant
topics.I would certainly say he is
one to watch in the future and this
ICA exhibition is certainly worth
a visit as once again,the Institute
has propelled an artist into my and
hopefully the public’s consciousness.
