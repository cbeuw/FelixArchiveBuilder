“Are these
pesticides
harmful to
humans?”
Fertile Crescent of Western
Asia provides the earliest
evidence so far of agricultural
development; dated to have occurred
in this region around 11,000 years
ago. This behaviour originated
independently at several locations
and spread globally.
In the last 50 years, following the
“green revolution”, we have seen
the intensification of agricultural
practice become increasingly more
extreme. Running parallel with this
is the heightened pressure agriculture
places on the environment. The
Anthropocene epoch is defined as
the period whereby humankind
began to significantly impact the
Earth’s ecosystems. Tapping into the
Earth’s energy supplies by extracting
resources; specifically oil, coal and
gas, marked the beginning of this
new geological era.
These resources, which we are now
totally dependent on, have provided
us with comforts no previous human
generation has experienced such as
the surplus supply of food in some
regions. This could have perhaps
aided the expansions of human
populations by almost three times
its original size 60 years ago. These
are, however, short term amenities,
and the provisioning cannot be
sustained based on our current
methods.
Fields running dry
We strive for continual economic
gain thus bad harvests must be
prevented. Infertile land has
become a distant memory in
most industrialised countries.
Irrigation has allowed expansion
of agricultural land in arid deserts.
Fossil water supplies found in
the ground deep below these
deserts have been overused for
irrigation, transforming these
deserts into arable land. Plots
have been abandoned as the
resource is depleted. Saudi Arabia
is estimated to have depleted more
than 80% of the original 500 cubic
kilometres of fossil water present.
Transformations of deserts to
farmland in Israel has depleted
water supplies from the River
Jordan, causing the level of the Dead
Sea to drop by over one metre per
year. These are only a few examples
but unfortunately they do not
represent exceptions. Agriculture
accounts for at least 70% of human
water consumption.
Pesticide overuse
The Anthropocene marks a heavy
dependence on the utilisation of
petrochemicals in agriculture.
Petrochemical manufacture
is extremely energy intensive;
1.2% of the world’s energy is
used to produce fertilisers alone.
Expansions of monocultures have
provoked surges in pest populations.
The use of pesticides has had
undesirable impacts on many
untargeted organisms. For example
organochlorides such as DDT
(dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane)
caused crashes in bird populations
such as the Peregrine falcon,
Turtle Dove and Yellow Wagtail.
From 1980-2009, 297 million
birds were killed due to the use of
organochlorides.
Honey bees, our natural
pollinators, are seeing rapid
population decline and pesticide
overuse has been attributed as a
cause of this decline. How can yield
be improved or even sustained
with the reduction of pollination
inherent in the decline in bee
populations? Are these pesticides
harmful to us humans? Despite the
lack of knowledge of the future and
existing implications of current
agricultural practice, we carry on
regardless.
Fertilisers
Fertilisers are another child of the
petrochemical revolution. Used to
force soils into fertility granting
us the opportunity to meet global
food demand, they have also caused
the global environmental nitrogen
supply to double since in the last 50
years. The emission of nitrogen due
to excessive fertiliser use causes air
and water pollution. N2
O makes up
54% of the greenhouse gas emissions
from the agricultural sector in the
UK.
The potential of this gas to
induce global warming is 298 times
greater than that of carbon dioxide.
Furthermore, fertilisers seep into
natural aquatic systems and cause
blooms of algae and Cyanobacteria
that suck out oxygen from these
systems, depleting the oxygen
source resulting in the deaths of
other respiring organisms. The
result is widespread ecosystem
damage.
Vegetarianism: the way
forward?
The extraction of the natural
resources in the Anthropocene
epoch has allowed machines to
replace men. A single machine
running on one litre of oil can
parallel the work done by 50 humans
in 24 hours. In the United States,
“Infertile
land has
become
a distant
memory.”
