Ben Howitt meets the Socratic Society’s committee
“How dare you accuse us
of being communist?”
The Socratic Society (SocSoc)
became a full society in
December of last year, as a
revival of the previously inactive
Philosophy Society.
I met up with two members from
the committee, Amelia Rath (Vice
Chair, Nietzsche) and Abhinav Varma
(Treasurer, Marx) to find out where
they came from and what they’re
aiming to do.
Ben: Okay, so where did the idea
for SocSoc come from? I’m calling
it SocSoc, is that okay?
Amelia: SocSoc’s fine! So, we got an
email from India [Jordan, Student
Activities Coordinator] and she just
saw that there was a philosophy
society before, but it was no longer
working, and…
Abhinav: It was completely inactive.
There’s no committee. I think the
last year, the committee consisted
of one person. It exists out there, but
there was nothing in principle. So she
emailed the members, because we had
signed up.
Am: We signed up to something, we
didn’t really know what it was...
B: So, was this one of many
Fresher’s Fair signups?
Ab: No, because they didn’t have
anything at Fresher’s Fair. It was
just the Union page that we found
interesting, so she was like “would
you like to start this?”. And so we met,
we fixed our first meeting...
Am: Four persons!
Ab: Yeah, there were four of us at the
first meeting. We’ve expanded now,
to around eight, I think.
Am: We’ve doubled already! The
committee, that is.
B: Cool! So you said eight on
committee; is that eight people
involved overall?
Ab: I think we have around 60 or
70 members. Probably a fraction
of those would be from last year.
And those who just joined, without
knowing exactly what it is. And of
course, now we’ve got more people to
join.
Am: So the interest is there.
B: Which is always good!
Ab: On paper we have 70 members,
anyway.
B: Just so I’ve got some perspective
on you guys, can you talk me
through who you are on the
committee, and why you’re at
Imperial?
Am: I’m doing the masters at the
business school. And yeah, I wanted
to join some societies, and so I looked
at the societies, and philosophy
was something I did already in my
undergraduate in Berlin, so I thought,
that would be perfect.
Ab: I’m an undergrad doing physics
with theoretical physics. I’ve never
studied philosophy, but always
been interested. I’m doing it for my
Horizons.
And our chair Jiayi, who couldn’t
be here, she has also done it in
undergrad, and since Imperial doesn’t
really have any philosophy course,
other than the Horizons one, we just
thought, we should do something.
You asked about the committee?
B: Yeah, just to have a perspective
on who everyone is.
Ab: It’s interesting. Initially, the first
meeting, obviously we didn’t know
each other. So deciding the committee
members who would be Chair,
Secretary was quite difficult, because
more than one person wanted to be
Chair, no-one wanted to be secretary,
so there was no point trying to be
democratic and voting on it, because
we didn’t know each other. So we
decided the most fair system would be
totally anarchic, put our names in a
hat and that’s exactly how we decided.
That’s how I became Treasurer, that’s
how she [Amelia] became Vice Chair,
Jiayi became Chair, and Samuel,
what’s your club activity like on a
general basis?
Am: We’re organising our plans, to
set up the website, and then talk to
people, invite people. We think, for
example, if we have a speaker or a date
where we do something together, then
everybody will turn up. We are in
different departments, so we can ask
everybody, and they will come.
Ab: On the speaker note, we’ve sent
ambassadors to other universities
to collaborate with the philosophy
societies there, but the most
immediate events are the Give it
a Go events, which are coming up.
Obviously this is for new members
to get a taste of what it’s like, they’ll
be free events. So we have booked a
room, we have planned events.
B: When’s this going to be?
Ab: This will be next Tuesday,
Thursday and the Tuesday after
that. So for the GIAG events, we’re
planning open mic debates – so semi-
structured debates, where we have one
person on either side. I’ll just tell you
about the three events.
So the first one is going to be on
freedom of speech vs. right to offend,
the whole Charlie Hebdo thing;
it’s quite a topical issue. So we’re
thinking of opening... one of us would
represent one side and opening up

who’s our fourth committee member,
became the Secretary.
B: That’s really cool!
Ab: Well, we thought it would be the
philosophical way to do it.
B: And your committee names are
odd as well, right? You don’t just
have a Chair or Treasurer, you
decided to put names on them.
Ab: Yes, we have Socrates, and
I’m Marx, because I’m Treasurer,
obviously. That kind of thing!
Am: We have Nietzsche, we have...
Yeah, everyone has a name.
B: Would you say you run SocSoc
on a Marxist system?
Ab: That’s an interesting question!
Am: No, we don’t!
Ab: No, no, of course not! How could
you accuse us of doing that?
Am: It’s a capitalist system, 100%.
Ab: It’s a new society, we’re all trying
to figure out what to do.
Am: And we want, actually, to find
out who everybody is!
Ab: There is the danger of becoming
communist, we must avoid that.
B: Okay, so you’ve got 60-70
members now. What have you
been doing to get new members in,
