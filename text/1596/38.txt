the trip to Brighton
Cross Country rocks
BUCS in Brighton
Early on Saturday 31st January a
37 strong team from Imperial
Cross Country took the train
down to Brighton to compete in the
BUCS Cross Country Championships,
apprehensively eyeing up the snow
from the windows. With the strongest
level of competition from universities
all over the country including a host
of elite athletes who have represented
England, Scotland and Great Britain
on an international stage this was
undoubtedly billed to be the race of
the year.
The courses set for men’s long, short
and women’s races were among the
toughest set in recent years, including
a gruelling ascent that would test all
including the strongest athletes, the
course had also been used the week
before for the South of England XC
championships, so it was already
heavily worn.
Imperial had a strong team fielded
for both men’s and women’s teams.
The men’s A-team included Spanish
international Alberto Sanchez,
BUCS 10km silver medallist Chris
Bannon, and fresher Chris Olley
who has had a storming season
including a sub 32min 10km. They
were backed up by XC old timer Chris
Thomas, PhD student Mike Ridley,
and triathlete David Freeman. In
the Women’s team big things were
expected from 3:04 marathoner Sarah
Johnson, international triathlete Imo
Simmonds, and track specialist Alex
Mundell.
The men’s A-race went out first at
midday, with the strongest 6 runners
in each University heading out on
a 12km, 3-lap route. The front pack
stayed together for the first 4km with
Bannon and Sanchez keeping close to
the front, and with Olley close behind
all looking strong. Meanwhile behind
Chris Thomas was putting down the
race of his life holding his own in a
strong field.
Halfway through the race a group
of four comprising of GB athletes,
Johnny Hay, Jonny Davies, Richard
Goodman, and Callum Hawkins
broke free with a large surge that tore
the field to pieces. The last 6km was
covered at breakneck speed, with Hay
(38:57) eventually winning by just
over 20m from Davies (39:00).
Imperial were headed home by
Sanchez (39:55) in 7th place overall
putting in a blistering finish to
pass Cambridge’s first back. He was
followed by Bannon (41:10) in 23rd,
Olley (41:39) in 35th, and Thomas
(44:06) in 90th to finish the scoring.
Freeman (46:20) followed in 141st
and Ridley (47:17) brought the
A-team home in 167th.
This finish placed Imperial in 7th
overall, gaining us valuable and hard
won BUCS points as a result of superb
performances, with Chris Thomas
particularly running the race of his
life under immense pressure, some
say his legs are still not working
nearly a week later!
In the women’s race it was a less
tactical affair, with the front pack
going for it from the start around the
steadily deteriorating course on their
own 6km route. After a small pileup,
when someone at the front of the
500 strong field took a tumble, the
race was stretched out by last year’s
runner up Emelia Gorecka who left
no chance in the result this time to
win by nearly 100m.
Thanks to some brilliant training in
recent weeks, Sarah Johnson (25:24)
was first home for Imperial in 37th,
Imo Simmonds (25:48) following
shortly after in 45th, Alex Mundell
(26:08) finished the scoring coming
back in 59th, no mean feat for
someone more at home in an 800m
race! These three great finishes meant
the Women’s Team placed 8th –
meaning more BUCS points!!
There were a further 8 finishers for
Imperial including Kimberly Mason
(29:27), Kara Meunier (32:24), Ophelie
Meuriot (33:54), Anna Lawson (34:15),
Lily Battershill (34:45), Freya Espir
(34:56) and Women’s Captain Cloudy
Carnegie (35:56).
They were spurred on by some
excellent cheering from the guys,
and when they began their second
lap were greeted a support team so
dedicated, they had gone topless in
the cold to paint ‘I M P E R I A L’
on their chests! Perhaps distracted
by such an impressive display,
Freya managed to win the prize for
muddiest finisher after taking a
massive fall and losing her number!
Up last was the men’s B(anter) race,

vertical descent to break the brown

monotony.
The race went out at a full on sprint
as happens each year with the hotly
contested first corner being taken by
a sprinter who narrowly edged out
a Durham runner painted head to
toe in purple paint! The front of the
race was as always dominated by St.
Mary’s and Birmingham running
cyborgs who blasted their way round
the course seemingly unaffected by
the mud or now typically British
‘character building’ weather.
Imperial’s men put in a strong
showing as ever with Simon Prigent
leading the charge with French
flair in 121st (30:55) he was closely
followed by strong run by Joss Knight
who held on over the challenging
Sanchez chases down the competition on the finishing straight. Photo: IC Cross Country
