Imperial Bhangra to hit Wembley stage
Saturday will see almost 4,000
students come together for the
biggest student Bhangra dance
competition in the UK. The event
is organised by Imperial College
London students.
The Bhangra Showdown will see
eight student bhangra dance troupes
go head to head on stage at Wembley
Arena, with students travelling from
Manchester, Leicester, Nottingham
and Birmingham to take part.
The event is organised by Imperial’s
Punjabi Society, who have been
planning the showcase for nearly
a year. A committee of only seven
students have put together the
evening, and will see teams from each
University going head to head before
one team is crowned champion.
Teams are made up of 15 to
20 students, and their teams of
supporters can extend into the
hundreds. This includes costume
designers, their make up teams, and
also fans of the groups. Alumni of
Imperial are also heavily involved,
with many coming back to help with
the lighting and stage settings for the
teams.
Although Imperial’s own team has
made it into the final three in the past
seven years, Birmingham’s team has
managed to take the top prize for two
years in a row.
Profits from the event will go
towards three different charities: one
local, one national and another more
internationally renowned.
The charities this year include
UK Friends of the Unique Home
(Punjabi), which raises money to
provide homes for abandoned girls in
Punjab, India. They are also raising
money for Variety: The Children’s
Charity, a UK based charity that
provides funding for children’s
hospitals, hospices and youth clubs.
All money raised from the night
will be split equally between these
two charities and Medecins Sans
Frontieres.
The Bhangra Showdown has been
run by Punjabi Society since 2007,
and previously was held in the
Hammersmith Apollo. However,
with tickets usually selling out, the
committee decided to move venues,
and ended up booking Wembley
Arena, with a capacity for 4,000

SiKL, a new app aimed to help
Sickle Cell Anaemia (SCA)
Patients, has been launched by
Clinicians of Imperial Health Care
Trust, after collaboration with the
Sickle Cell Society and participants
from the TalkLab Initiative.
SiKL works as a smartphone
based disease management method
supplementing original paper-based
medical records. SCA patients may
now keep a never-out-of-space record
of their conditions and actively
engage in their own treatments.
As a medical record, SiKL possesses
more mobility. As long as the SCA
patient carries his phone, he can
easily monitor medicine dosage,
hydration intake, or blood tests and
transfusion appointments, which can
be fairly frequent for this particular
disease.
Also, SiKL may act as a lifesaver. As
a person always carries his phone, in
times of emergency SiKL may help
distinguishing his condition and
treatment needed more quickly.
According to NHS figures, up to
13,500 people in UK are affected
by Sickle Cell Anaemia, and in
developing countries, this disease
is even more prevalent. SiKL is now
available globally on the app store,
and has been downloaded by over
300 people.
However, Dr. Kit Huckvale from
Faculty of Medicine, School of Public
Health adds, “I think there probably
would be work to do to develop and
further refine it for particular needs
and particular settings.”
Patients and their close relatives
have participated in the creation of

development as well, by providing
feedback and ideas such as adding

Maninder Bhambra, who is the
Co-President of the Imperial Punjabi
Society, said “I got involved in TBS as
a fresher as a dancer. The following
year I was involved in the organising
committee and now I have the
honour of leading the team that is
taking the show to its grandest venue
yet, Wembley Arena. When you put it
like that, it sounds so utterly surreal.”
Deputy President (Clubs and
Societies) at the Imperial College
Union, Abigail de Bruin said of
the Bhangra showdown: “It’s really
exciting to see our students not
only taking part in but actually
organising such a large scale event.
I’m really proud of the commitment
our students have shown and feel
priveleged to have taken part in the
process.”
more and more active role in their
own treatment over these years, and
SiKL is another tool to this end. Yet
traditional medical records are not to
be replaced, as Dr. Huckvale believes,
“The question of how do you bridge
between patients and clinicians still
needs to be explored in a bit more
detail.”
