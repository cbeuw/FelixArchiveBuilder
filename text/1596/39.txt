e-ing For Mud”
climbs to 190th (32:50) with Club
Captain Matt Douthwaite hot on his
heels despite recovering from illness
in 210th (33:16).
Spirits were lifted on the killer
course when the girls reciprocated
the guys display of support with ‘IC
XC!’ painted on their stomachs! For
some reason they decided not to flash
anything more than their stomachs.....
but it was just what a load of tired
guys need 4k into an 8k XC race.
Feeling at home in the muddy
environment, Will Jones came in a
short while later in 34:07, though
he would have preferred the race
to be a bit longer! Duncan Ingram
(returning from a year in industry
specially) and triathlete Tom
Miller (probably missing his bike)
impressively followed in 34:42 and
35:53 respectively.
Rob O’Keeffe (36:14) showed it’s not
all about the race with a show for the
crowd, flashing some shotgun poses
and repeating his legendary belly-
slide down the muddiest hill. Sadly
the camera’s weren’t rolling at this
point.
The 220m of ascent were
challenging to experienced and new
club members alike, with Alwyn
Elliott, taking part in his final BUCS,
finishing in 38:17 and James Tebbutt
finishing in 40:45, not far behind
our signing from Scotland Marcus
Ingram (36:30). Paul Vidal (39:02),
Matt Tilley (39:42), Charlie Williams
(41:11) and Felix Nicol (41:32) also
performed at their debut BUCS
XC. Lawrence Tse (43:00) showed is
dedication to the club once again
by running not at full fitness and
400m runner Henryk Hadass (44:41)
decided to try something new.
After the excitement of all the
races, the team demolished the
tonnes and tonnes of cakes, cookies
and scones lovingly baked by various
club members (seriously they were
amazing!). Even the fantastic cheer
squad of Liam Smith, James Ellis
and Tom Stokes – who were out due
to injury but knew how amazing the
weekend would be – were knackered.
Stuffed full but getting very cold and
wet, there was just time for a quick
team photo before heading back
into Brighton for the celebrations to
begin!
The group headed to the down
to the ‘sea view’ hostel a perfectly
located base just 260m from the
afterparty. After a hot shower (for
about 5 of us) and a cold one for the
rest, the team headed over to Taste
of the Sahara for the start of the
evenings celebrations.
The theme of the evening was
‘dress to impress’ and so Imperial’s
team interpreted this by channelling
our inner-Brighton and wearing
matching tie-dye t-shirts, lovingly
prepared the previous weekend by
Will, Cloudy and others. The food at
Taste of the Sahara was delicious and
the drinks were numerous.
After the delicious meal, we
returned to the seafront to the BUCS
after-party which was being held at
Shooshh, which looked right out onto
the sea.
Of course we first had to have an
obligatory Tie-dye-team-on-the-
beach photo before entering the club
to set the trend in true ICXC fashion.
We attracted many an envious
compliment for our tie-dye outfits
and were by far the best dressed there!
– you might say they were tie-dye for!
Spirits high, the party lasted until
the early hours – though some
members of the team were forced
to head home slightly earlier than
others. Some stayed it out however
and there were talks of the higher
level athletes showing the most
stamina on the night out too, with a
rumoured 4am scholarship selfie.
The next many shaken figures
dragged themselves down to breakfast
– some still in tie-dye out fits.
From the cheering, shouting and
singing, there were suddenly a lot
fewer people able to speak, and
only one made on a morning run.
There was a lot of sleeping on the
train home and much resting will be
needed for the HYDE PARK RELAYS
on Saturday 7th Feburary.
