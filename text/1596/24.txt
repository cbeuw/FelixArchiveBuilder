"Best
known for
his fleshy
nudes, this
exhibition
reveals the
variety of
the Master's
production"
In collaboration with the Royal
Museum of Fine Arts of Antwerp,
the Royal Academy presents the
first exhibition in the UK exploring
Rubens’ influence on subsequent art
history.
This extremely rich display
demonstrates the lasting impact
Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640) had on
successful painters during the three
centuries following his death.
The curators have managed to
bring together over 150 masterpieces
of Rubens and the artists who later
made use of his techniques; the
list of artists featured is expansive,
including Van Dyck, Watteau,
Murillo, Gainsborough, Reynolds,
Turner, Delacroix, Manet, Cézanne,
Renoir, Klimt and Picasso.
Drawing on his deep knowledge of
Renaissance art and Italian Masters,
Rubens managed to develop his
own style of realism and brushwork,
creating monumental portraits &
romantic landscapes, becoming the
most sought-after Flemish Master
during his life. An early widower, he
travelled Europe to offer his services
to his many royal patrons, leaving
behind an exceptionally prolific and
versatile body of work. Crucially,
this unanimously acclaimed
heritage scattered around Europe
was available to serve as model for
the formation of next generations
of artists. Moreover, many of his
masterpieces were engraved and
largely diffused throughout the
known world. In the exhibition there
is even a 17th
century Chinese plate
copying one of Rubens’ paintings!
Whilst Rubens is best known for
his portraiture of fleshy nudes, this
exhibition reveals the variety of the
Master’s production and the codes
he invented; from composition to
theme, style to colour, Rubens’ legacy
has unmatched resonance for artists,
even to the present day.
The curators have therefore opted
for a thematic display: Poetry,
Elegance, Power, Lust, Compassion
and Violence. Each of Rubens’
paintings are intuitively shown
opposite his followers’, stressing the
technique laid down by the Master
and picked up later. We start with
his own assistant Van Dyck and
move from Boucher and Watteau
in 18th
century; through Delacroix,
Constable and Daumier in the 19th
century; and to Cézanne and Picasso
in the 20th.
Poetry presents bucolic landscapes
of Gainsborough, Constable and
Turner and romances by Watteau.
Elegance displays portraits of the Elite
by Van Dyck and Fragonard. Power
comprises sketches of monumental
frescos and ceilings by Thornhill.
Compassion showcases religious
works by Delacroix. Violence exposes
impressive depictions of infernal
scenes and dramatic confrontations
of man and beast during hunts by
Delacroix and Soutman. Finally,
Lust reveals nudes by many inspired
successors, including Cézanne and
Picasso to name but a few.
In parallel with Rubens and His
Legacy: Van Dyck to Cézanne, Royal
Academician Jenny Saville prepared
a response entitled La Peregrina.
Exhibited in one of the last rooms,
this display presents works by
modern artists such as Willem de
Kooning, Pablo Picasso, Francis
Bacon, and Sarah Lucas. Saville has
even created a new work especially
for the occasion: Voice of the Shuttle
(Philomela).
La Peregrina takes its name from
an exceptional pearl depicted by
Rubens in his time that eventually
came to belong to Andy Warhol’s
muse, Elizabeth Taylor. Although
La Peregrina never appeared in
Warhol’s work, Saville sees it as a
brilliant name for the display she has
brought together; unlike the obvious
relations between Rubens’ and
others’ paintings in the main exhibit,
she creates a dialogue with Rubens
through the medium of modern
art. The works on display have for
Saville an inherent debt to Rubens in
terms of composition and colour; the
quasi-subliminal links she establishes
constitute indubitably a vibrant
homage to the Flemish Master.
Throughout the rooms, it is striking
to discover the legacy left by Rubens
to art in general, and even more
fascinating to realize the breadth
of his work. Indeed, most of the
brilliant successors who claimed to
have been influenced by Rubens were
specialized in very different themes,
in fact all six aforementioned. It
seems that we can conclude the
exhibition is a success, meeting
perfectly its goal of demonstrating
Rubens’ influence on prominent
artists who came long after him.
Rubens and His Legacy: Van Dyck to
Cézanne is at the Royal Academy of Arts
until April 10th.
