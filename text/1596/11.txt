How to map the Heavens

Astrophysicist Professor Alan Heavens talks to Ben Fernando about
how we measure distances in the universe
“If we
look at the
geometry
of the
universe,
we can
learn about
what’s in
it.”
Ben Fernando: So why is it
important to measure distances in
cosmology?
Alan Heavens: According to General
Relativity, the Universe’s geometry is
related to its matter content. So if we
look at the geometry of the universe,
we can tell something about what’s
in it – which we’re obviously very
interested in because we don’t know
what 96% of the energy density is!
In order to investigate the geometry
of the Universe, we need to measure
distances, and we do this using
‘standard rulers’. For example, in
normal [Euclidian] space, if you place
a ruler in the sky at a given distance
and then double this distance, the
size of the ruler halves. However, this
is not the case in curved space. Some
models predict that a distant ruler
will start getting bigger again as it gets
further away, so if we observe this we
know that particular model is correct.
BF: So clearly these ‘standard
rulers’ are very important, but
what exactly are they?
AH: They’re the size of the Universe’s
sound horizon, which is about
470 million light years (roughly
4.4x1024
m).
Today, sound waves no longer
propagate through the Universe,
because the density is too low.
However, not long after the Big Bang
when the Universe was much denser
and hotter, the radiation pressure
provided support to the gas that filled
the Universe and this allowed sound
waves to propagate.
Matter and radiation were strongly
coupled, and oscillated together as
sound passed through them. Back
then, sound waves moved with speeds
comparable to the speed of light.
After about 400,000 years, the matter
and the radiation decoupled, and the
photons stopped exerting pressure
on the gas, so sound waves could
no longer propagate. This created a
‘sound horizon’ that constrains what
the Universe’s expansion rate was
soon after the Big Bang.
Measuring the size of the Universe’s
sound horizon (the ‘standard ruler’) is
clearly very important! But we found
that no one had actually measured
it. The sound horizon left a small
imprint in the matter distribution of
the Universe, and at certain points
this results in an excess of galaxies
that we can observe and measure.
However, when we make these
measurements all we can actually do
is measure the angular separation
of galaxies on the sky. To translate
these angles into physical distances
requires us to know the geometry of
the Universe.
Most calculations in the past have
assumed a certain geometry and
from that calculated the separation
between galaxies, but it turns out this
isn’t actually necessary – all we need
to do is assume that the Universe has
certain symmetries, we don’t even
need to consider General Relativity.
BF: How does this come in useful?
AH: Well, we now have an almost
model-independent measurement
of the length of the ‘standard ruler’.
We’ve not made assumptions about
what sort of Universe we live in,
or about the nature of General
Relativity.
All we’ve assumed is the
Cosmological Principle, that we
don’t live in a special place within
the Universe – and all the data we
have so far suggests that this is a valid
assumption.
Now that we have a measurement
of this length, all theories about
the Universe will have to make
predictions that are in agreement
with our value, or else be discarded.
BF: And how long is this length?
AH: About 143±3.5 Mpc (4.4x1024
m).
BF: How did you acquire the data
needed to make this measurement?
AH: As I mentioned previously, the
effect of sound waves in the early
universe creates a small increase in
the number of galaxies at certain
separations. We looked at surveys
of about a million galaxies for this,
and then at data from about 750
supernova explosions to constrain the
expansion history of the Universe.
BF: So what will be the next step
with this research?
AH: We’d like to use some bigger
surveys to make our measurements
more precise. The length of the
standard ruler is affected by the
number of neutrino species that exist,
and right now our measurements
confirm that there are definitely no
more than four species, and probably
no more than three. More data would
help us to confirm that there are
indeed only three species of neutrino.
Our measurements allow us to look
at a time when the Physics of the
Universe was very simple, so we can
come to robust conclusions that may
or may not be caused by the effects of
dark energy.
“All new
theories
about the
Universe
will have to
agree with
our value,
or else be
discarded.”
