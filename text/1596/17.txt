Martin Luther King Jr.’s
most famous ‘I have a
dream” speech does not
feature’ in Selma, which may come
as a surprise to viewers walking into
this not knowing too much about
the history of the American Civil
Rights Movement. Dr King did more
than give that speech, and the events
of Selma in fact come after that
landmark moment and the march to
Washington. Ava DuVernay’s new
film instead focuses on the Selma to
Montgomery marches that took place
that led to the passage of the Voting
Rights Act.
Despite the passage of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, African-
Americans are still being refused
when trying to register to vote, as
evidenced by Annie Lee Cooper
(Oprah Winfrey, in a brief but
important role), who is unfairly
quizzed and discriminated against
at the voters registration office in
Selma, Alabama. Dr King sees Selma
as the new battleground, and sets
up base there with his supporters.
Meetings with President Lyndon B.
Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) are never
as fruitful as he would hope, with the
President never promising, but only
cautiously reassuring Dr King that
things will change with time. Peaceful
demonstrations are organised, ones
that inevitably end up in blood-
soaked tragedy as certain members
of the law refuse to see past people’s
colour.
David Oyelowo is mesmerising as
King, disappearing into the iconic
role as the takes centre stage. His

commanding, inspirational lead
performance is an award-worthy one,
and the lack of an Oscar nomination
in the Best Actor field for Oyelowo
will become something that will
always appear in the ‘snubbed’ lists
for years to come. His character is put
through a lot; he has many speeches
to make in front of crowds; but he
also has the behind-the-scenes, more
intimate, personal look at his private
life, and the toll this Movement is
taking on him, and Brit revelation
Oyelowo is faultless in every frame.
He is backed by a strong supporting
cast that includes two Brits in the
roles that stand in the way of Dr
King’s dream. Wilkinson is stoic and
dignified as the President caught in
a difficult situation. It would be lazy
to label him as simply the villain;
the film does well to explain his
predicament throughout the film.
Whilst Dr King’s goal is a simple one,
POTUS instead has a lot of things
to juggle and people to please. The
real antagonist here is Tim Roth as
Alabama Governor George Wallace,
who does his absolute best to come
across the most detestable man
imaginable, and Roth succeeds in that
respect.
Most surprising however, is how
Dr King’s wife, Coretta Scott King’s
(Carmen Ejogo) role is handled. The
clichéd long-suffering spouse of a
famous historical figure is a tiresome
one, but here Ejogo is given more
material than would usually be given
for a supporting performance. She is
right to be worried for her husband
and for her family, but there is an
air of warmth and genuine concern
that surrounds Ejogo’s effortless
performance.
DuVernay’s film and the images
it portrays is shockingly relevant
even to this day. A young black teen
getting shot at point blank range
by a white police officer echoes
the countless shootings that have
happened in the States of late, and
there is no getting over how such a
thing only became a national issue in
the 1960s, merely five decades or so in
the past. The marches themselves are
a sight to behold, with people from
all over the United States coming
over to join in the fight. There
are unexpected casualties, and an
infuriating body toll where even one
death is one too many. Even audience
members far removed from this part
of history will find something to
admire and appreciate in the stirring
Selma, an under-appreciated film
that is not getting nearly as much
attention as it should be.

THE INTERVIEW

SECTION EDITOR
Jacques Audiard’s Rust and Bone
no longer takes the crown for
the best use of a Katy Perry song.
This award now surely goes to The
Interview, a film that has become a
lot more famous thanks to a certain
country’s rather irrational reaction
towards the film’s release. After
this you will never hear the song
‘Firework’ the same way again. The
controversy-ridden comedy starts out
with James Franco and Seth Rogen
as two ordinary Americans working
in the entertainment industry
unwittingly recruited by the CIA to
achieve the almost impossible – to
assassinate the leader of North Korea,
Kim Jung Un (Randall Park). Turns
out, Kim is a big fan of the chat show
hosted by Dave Skylark (Franco), and
produced by Aaron Rapaport (Rogen).
Franco and Rogen are essentially
playing the same roles they have done
in their many, many collaborative
films. It takes a while to get used to
the over-the-top, chaotic behaviour
of Skylark, often more irritating than
anything else from the moment he
appears on the screen, but thankfully
for the audience there is Rapaport’s
character to keep things a little more
grounded in the opening scenes.
Before entering North Korea
as Kim’s invited leaders there are
moments of hilarity as Skylark and
Rapaport get settled into their new
roles of working as spies. The two
actors once again share a brilliant
chemistry, going through the ups and
downs that test their friendship and
push their buttons.
Events become more complicated
as Skylark in particular gets to
know the North Korean leader on a
personal level; it turns out that Kim
is not quite as evil as the Western
media has portrayed him to be
over all these years. He is a leader
struggling to appease his people, live
up to the standard of being a feared,
ruthless President while living under
the shadow of his father who has set
the bar pretty high when it comes to
doing anything that violates human
rights, when he would rather be
sitting around sipping on margaritas,
listening to Katy Perry, his guilty
pleasure music, whilst playing
basketball. It is an interesting,
comical take on a real-life figure we
think we know well. Not that this
film is in any way trying to convey
something non-fictional in the
narrative, but the image of the leader
of North Korea being a cheerful,
boyish man-child played brilliantly
by Park certainly has its moments of
highly effective comedy.
It does start to lose it in the film’s
climax – there is a vomit-inducing
burst of a violent action sequence
that involves the control of a joystick
stuck inside an unlucky North
Korean soldier’s orifice, but aside
from that grim/riotous (delete
as appropriate) addition, there is
nothing too creative that will hold
your attention. The jokes on offer
are a mixed bag of hits and misses,
ranging from poking fun at racial
stereotypes, to the juvenile poop
jokes, often venturing into the more
adult world of sexual misadventures
and innuendos.
North Korea was right to be upset
by this of course; no one wants to see
their Supreme Leader portrayed in
this way, but here it is anyway, for the
rest of world to sit back and laugh at
how easy it would be to achieve peace
and democracy in North Korea. Just
ask Seth Rogen and James Franco.
