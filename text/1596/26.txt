Napoleon: The Power Of Political Propaganda
As George Orwell once said:
“all art is propaganda”. The
work of an artist cannot
be separated from the social and
political context in which it is
formed, no matter how inoffensive it
seems, and this lesson is exemplified
by the British Museum’s latest
exhibition. Bonaparte and the British
– which should already give you an
idea of the strained relationships
found within – looks at the power of
images during the Napoleonic wars,
specifically those created by British
satirists.
With artists like Steve Bell working
today, and Charlie Hebdo remaining
in the headlines, it is easy to forget
that the true Golden Age of British
satire was during the turn of the 19th
Century, when cartoonists such as
George Cruikshank and James Gillray
took aim at every social institution
existing at the time, British or
otherwise. Napoleon is shrunk down
to Little Boney by Cruikshank in a
literal belittlement; he is made to
eat dried beans, and blow the French
army across the Channel with his
flatus; and he is transfigured into a
horrific monster, threatening the
foundations of Great Britain.
But not all the works are negative;
the British Museum has also made
the shrewd choice to include portraits
of Napoleon himself, not all of which
are accurate. Most of them show
the general as some form of heroic
Grecian emperor, with mandatory
chiseled jawline and strong brow;
while I am sure that Napoleon wasn’t
horrifically unattractive, these prints
make it clear that sometimes winning
over hearts and minds is all about
looking hella fine, something that
Napoleon knew and took advantage
of, distributing his prints across
Europe. For those wondering what
the relevance of such a message is
today, all you need to do is look at
someone like Ed Miliband to see how
image still rules the voters.
The explanatory captions are
excellent, explaining precisely what
is going on in each cartoon, which
is useful when one considers the
sheer level of detail included; each
sheet is a masterpiece in miniature,
with double-entendres and literary
references built up layer upon layer.
They are also great at giving us the
historical context, which may be
necessary for those not up to scratch
with their Napoleonic history (guilty
Dogugaeshi: Playful Puppetry without a Punch

Fred Fyles finds out all about Japanese puppetry at the Barbican Centre
"Rather
than a play
as such,
Dogugaeshi
is more of a
performance"
Puppetry is a dying art. It may
not attract the same kind of
think-pieces that occur when
we fear that e-books may replace the
comforting rustle of pages, or when
small theatre companies are snuffed
out one-by-one due to lack of funds,
but the fate facing the puppeteer is
no less uncertain. Dogugaeshi at the
Barbican Centre makes us aware of
both how far the art form has slipped
from popular opinion, and displays
the work of a puppeteer who has – to
the extent that puppeteers can – made
it big.
The work of ‘third-generation’
puppeteer Basil Twist, Dogugaeshi
takes its name from an ancient
Japanese theatre tradition of using
a series of sliding screens to alter
perspective. Don’t bother googling
it; pretty much limited to the small
island of Awaji, the tradition is little-
known, even within Japan. As part of
his research Twist travelled to Awaji,
where he did manage to find a group
of women who had seen a Dogugaeshi
show back in the 1950s, but more
often than not simply discovered
the remains of this once-vibrant
tradition: faded screens, tattered gilt
work, and repurposed stages.
Twist has spoken of how the
practice is closely related to his own
work, which often involves innovative
uses of puppetry, incorporating
flowing material, and non-human
figures. Having recently collaborated
with Kate Bush on her Before The
Dawn stage show (I didn’t manage
to get tickets; it’s still a bit of a sore
spot), Twist can now be regarded
as somewhat famous. Perhaps not
famous in the traditional sense, but
probably as famous as puppeteers are
likely to get – after all, not everyone
can be Jim Henson.
Within Dogugaeshi, screens shift
back and forth across the stage, flip
round to reveal giant dragons, and
fall from the ceiling as the mansion
central to the plot begins to decay.
Rather than an actual play as such,
what Twist presents us with is much
more of a performance: a series of
tableaux, which slowly fade into one
another, blurring different scenes
together. There is a sort of loose
plot: or rather themes which recur
throughout the performance; ideas of
travel, decay, and revival all come up
again and again, as Twist reflects on
the very nature of Dogugaeshi as an
art form.
While presenting things in this
way is obviously a stylistic choice, the
lack of structure makes it difficult
to understand what is going on, or
indeed why we should care. The
action is watched over by a mystical
nine-tailed fox – the only apparition
which could fit the traditional idea

of a ‘puppet’ – and Yumiko Tanaka, a
master shamisen player, whose work
includes both traditional Japanese
tradition, and more experimental
fare. The atonal, haunting sound of
her shamisen swirls around beating
drums, while her singing adds a
near-drone like element over the top.
Ensconced in a beautifully severe
kimono, and sitting poised at the
edge of the stage, Tanaka’s playing
alone is worth the ticket price. Several
times during the piece I found myself
focussing on her complex finger-work
as opposed to the action occurring in
the centre.
And therein lies the heart of
Dogugaeshi’s problem: it simply
isn’t that engaging. While Twist
does develop the genre of puppetry,
involving projections, video, and
certain experiments with perspective
which are admittedly extraordinary,
there are only so many times that I
can watch screens – exquisite though
they might be – being shuffled
along a stage. After the show, Twist
talked about how some elements of
Dogugaeshi evolved as a solution for
scene changes, and this is reflected
in the nature of the performance.
Watching Dogugaeshi is like being
constantly on edge, anticipating the
moment when the actors will appear,
and the action will finally start.
Dogugaeshi was on at the Barbican
Centre as part of the London
International Mime Festival, which takes
place every January.

as charged).
What is fascinating about the
exhibition is how it displays the
changing way Napoleon was
documented in British culture; at the
beginning of the wars he is seen as
noble among the British republicans;
when he flees from Egypt following
his defeat at the hands of Lord
Nelson, he is shown as a yellow-
bellied coward; as a peace deal is
brokered, he begins to command
respect; but when war returns, he is
ruthlessly attacked, as he begins to
strike fear into the hearts of many
British people. The curators have
said that they “are not trying to
tell the truth about Napoleon, but
the propaganda”; at this they have
certainly succeeded, showing us the
power, beauty, and genius of political
propaganda.
Bonaparte & the British is on until 16th
August. Free Entry.
