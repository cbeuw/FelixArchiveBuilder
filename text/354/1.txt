Why students have a bad
image.
Why is it that no matter
how hard we try to im-
prove the "student image"
there are always those
people who have no inten-
tion of doing so, but
simply take advantage of
the fact that they are stu-
dents to act like idiots?
We can all, I am sure,
appreciate that while we are
students we can get away
with many Stunts, e.g. dur-
ing the Rag weeks, but why
should some of our compa-
triots be allowed to wreck
our Union building and,
more important, property
not belonging to us and
generally be no more than
a pain in the neck to the
rest of society?
I am not talking of the
regular "piss artistes", for
whom I have little sym-
pathy, but also about the
others who stick their
noses into other people's
business which has abso-
lutely nothing to do with
them. Why the Hell should
I have to waste my time
sorting out members of
the public who inform me
that our students have
been disturbing them?
Why should I have to
spend hours trying to ex-
plain that the reason that
the Union lift is not work-
ing, and has not been since
before Christmas, is be-
cause some fool decided
that he wanted the control
panel as a souvenir of the
valuable work which he
has done for the Union!
I do not believe that it
5s a majority of our stu-
dents who are creating
these problems, but what
is important is that the few
are creating a very bad
image for the whole.
If you want to help to
improve our image, then
please try to keep your im-
becile friends under some
sort of control.
Elections •— Internal
Following on from the
above, it is perhaps an ap-
propriate switch to move
on to the topic of student
leaders for next year.
As you may or may not
know, this term we elect
the Union officers for next
year. You may for many
reasons read this and
merely say "Boring" (as
the typical I.C. student is
apt to say about anything
which he/she does not un-
derstand), but if you do,
then I am afraid that you
will get just what you de-
serve,
A L L the Union officers
have a representative role
to play during their year
of office, and it is up to
you to make sure that the
leaders are representing
your views, otherwise you
have no comeback (as in
the case of N.U.S.) with the
decisions which are made
if they are in direct opposi-
tion to your own views.
What you may be saying
to yourself (if you are
thinking about the problem
at all) is "O.K., so I'll
come out and vote, but
what if no one stands for
the job?" A l l that I can
say to that is that none of
the Union posts (except
sabbaticals) take up a great
deal of time — if they are
done properly and effici-
ently — so why don't you
stand for one? It doesn't
cost anything, and you
never know, you may be
able to help the Union in
your own way.
. If you would like, in any
way, to help the Union
to function next year then
go as soon as possible —
to see the relevant Union
officer for this year, and
I am sure that they would
be only too happy to give
you all the information on
what their job entails, then
all that you need to do is
to convince the relevant
group of people that you
really are the person to do
the job for which you are
F I R E H O S E S
The annual testing of the Union fire hoses will take
place on Tuesday, 26th February, during the lunch
break. Coincidentally this coincides with Shrove Tues-
day. Because of this there is a strong possibility that
there will also be the annual Shrove Tuesday pan-
cake race, also round the Beit quadrangle. (Funny how
all three always seem to coinside—Ed.). Whether you
make a bee-line for the quadrangle at this time, or
avoid it like the plague is up to you. However, fair
warning must be given that there is likely to be a very
localised, extremely heavy period of rain (!?) in that
vicinity at or about the lunch^time period. The Union
will not accept any liability for person or persons
caught in this unfortunate freak weather condition.
standing, and they will vote
for you.
Electionns — External
As I am sure that you
all know, there is a General
Election on the 28th of
this month, and once again
I hope that you will all go
out and vote in the way
which you fed will do the
most for the student body
as a whole. I am not
going to put out all the
typical crap telling you to
force the present Govern-
ment, to^give way to an-
other equally biased one,
as this decision is for you
to make. What has been
done is to arrange a meet-
ing on Tuesday, the 19th
February in the Great
Hall, to which a Conserva-
tive, Labour and Liberal
candidate for election in
this particular area have
been invited to answer
your questions.
Prof. Neal, the Pro-
Rector, has agreed to take
the chair for the meeting,
and we hope to have a
series of questions to ask
the speakers in order to get
the discussion under way.
The meeting will begin
at 1.00 and will finish at
around 2.30. It will be
Y O U R meeting, and thus
it is important that you
attend in order to get the
best possible value for
money.
