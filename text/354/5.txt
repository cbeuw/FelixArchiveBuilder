• This Saturday, the 23rd, the Hyde
Park Relay will descend once more
upon the Union, attracting some 600
people, many from foreign lands afar,
to run in this internationally famed
Jevent. The race is over 6 laps of a 3
Jmile course based on the Serpentine,
starting by the Lido on Rotten Row
and taking between 85 and 120 min-
utes for the teams to complete, and is
organised by IC Cross Country Club.
Now all this means that a large
number of willing helping hands are
required, not only to record times and
teams, but also to work out the results,
to sell programmes and to point peo-
ple around the course; training given,
but experience as a shepherd helpful.
The rewards offered for this muchf
needed help are the chance to prac-
tice your French, German, Swedish
Flemish, Spanish and English, and
your sums (subtracts mostly), and a
meal of the same high energy content
as that used to sustain those actually
running.
So, if you'd like to help, contact
your friendly local cross country run-
ner, or come along oh the afternoon
between, say, one and two. Or just
come and watch—it starts at 3 p.m.
