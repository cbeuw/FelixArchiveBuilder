FINAL
(Episode 5)
I C 1 3 U C 6
The first round of this needle match was won by IC
when they burst into Shenley and immediately took
over the U C dressing room.
The match was only 10 minutes old when U C were
6 points up due to two penalty goals due to bad for-
ward play. (All the backs laughed.) Following this Ray
(I can't drop goals with my left foot) Hughes missed a
drop goal by absolute miles. (In actual fact he hit the
post.)
During intensive pressure by the IC forwards there
was a five-yard scrum, and big Nigger (ie Oz) scored
a pushover try (Bradley didn't lift his prop off the
ground, raucous laughter). The IC team, determined
to lead by half-time, decided to let Dave Rimmer
have a go at goal and against all expectation he scored
(sorry Dave) and IC led 7—6 at half-time.
After half-time it was so one sided that I needn't
waste my breath. Dicky (Peak, Shrunker, Donkey)
Creswell scored an excellent try which was converted
by Dave Rimmer (if this is wrong blame Chudy). The
score was then 13—6, and the score remained so until
the ref, under intense pressure from supporter S.
Chudy, blew the final whistle.
IC then proceeded to their nth final on the trot
and of course will win.
- As everyone wanted a mention here we go:
D. Shakesheff — Injured shoulder; M . Cotter — wan-
ker and missed an easy try; Bob Stern — Crunch
tackle (—so he tells me); R. Hughes — say no more;
Flanagan — he was too pissed to know the difference;
T. Walton — get your hair cut; Hippo and Ugly •—
they won some line out balls; J. Hughes — he's too
old anyway; D. Hart and Beefburger — A l l I need to
say is that they sleep in the same room in a flat!
This accounts for most of the team.
Best of luck in the final!
RIFLE CLUB
(1) C & G vs. R C S
(vs. RSM)
The Courtman Shield
is a competition held an-
nually between the con-
stituent Colleges of Im-
perial College. This is
usually run on the basis
of the best of three mat-
ches, one each week for
three consecutive weeks.
In the past few years
Guilds have won in only
two rounds, and yet again
they lived up to their re-
putation, the events being
on Mondays Feb 4th and
11th. The first round
might as well have been
the last for RCS, since
they were sufficiently dis-
heartened by defeat for
the second round to be a
mere formality. (Although
it turned out much closer
than was expected.) This
year, for the first time for
at least five years, the
R S M produced a 'team',
although despite some cle-
ver disguises I D I D notice
sthat there were in fact
only ever three members
of that college ever pre-
sent at one time on the
range! The names of their
team give an indication of
the suspicious nature of
the people who did shoot.

H A M S C H O O L
For those of you who
are saying what's Up-
pingham, the. answer is
that it has probably the
best (or at least one of the
most feared) Public
School shooting teams in
the country. They shoot
consistently well in the
National Schools champ-
ionships, and hold the

X-COUNTRY
Since the last cross-
country report raised the
cultural level of the aver-
age Felix reader, IC Su-
perstars (as we're known
to our fans) have not been
idle. On Saturday 2nd,
whilst Rob Allinson was
having his foot spiked
for U L U at BUSF
Champs, an expedition of
the club's artists (i.e. any-
body) took place to the
Newland Park Relay. It
was not quite as difficult
to find as anticipated,
everyone followed Keith
Abies, because he had the
map, and even knew
which way up it should
be. However miles of road
and a six foot fence had
to be negotiated before we
arrived. Although only
nine came, IC fielded two
teams of Six, Steve Webb
and Keith ran the 2i miles
twice, then our long lost
star Joe Keating offered
to run for our B team, so
they didn't finish last
(quite!). The A team were
just ahead of them. As an
act of support for the
noise abatement society, a
very loud bell was confis-
cated after the race.
Wednesday saw another
home match, this time
against U C , who despite
only having a few runners
(it was pension day for
Mike Baggs) managed to
piss all1
over us quite con-
vincingly. Ian Ellis and
Phil Meyler were first two
home for IC. However the
two major events of the
day, were the continued
come-back of Ian Isher-
wood, and the inebria-
tion of a certain high (the
highest) ranking club offi-
cial, who then threw his
maths notes about with
gay abandon.
On Saturday there was
the annual madness of the
Southerns over a very
muddy Party Hill. Mike
'Babyface' Welford, the
well known youth, came
somewhere out of a hell
of a lot. I C s junior team
finished ninth or to put it
another way last. Pdte
Johnson was last man to
finish only just behind
Dave 'doesn't deserve a
mention this week' Pupe
and Dave Holbrooke.
Ian Ellis was a bit fur-
ther up the field. In the
Seniors (nine miles) Steve
Webb finished somewhere
out of a hell of a lot more
followed by Dave Jones
and Ian Isherwood who
thinks he was last. The
only bright spot of the day
was IC people looking
important by cheering in
Mick Fuller (RCM) who
came 15th. Pubic apolo-
gies to Brendon and l<?hn
Cric for accusing them of
nicking the beer that we
nicked in Brighton, and
we'll try not to break any
more glasses.

record score in this com-
petition. So I.C. prepared
to show them how to
shoot on Monday 11th
Feb, since they were pay-
ing -a visit to London
from their home in Rut-
land (or has it become
Leics., now?). The result
was that we beat them by
765 points to 756. They
claim to have fielded a
weakened team due -to a
spate of flu in the school,
but nevertheless it was a
good win, as none of us
was shooting particularly
well.
Finally a note to long
lost Rifle Club Members
—• the Individual Compe-
titions, on a handicap
baSis where appropriate,
will be starting in about
three weeks, and they
only last for a week, so if
you want some practice,
you'd better get on with
it. It is proposed to have
some cash prizes, as well
as the usual Trophies for-
competition.
If enough are inter-
ested this year, we may
well reintroduce the tra-
ditional drinking cere-
mony for the overall win-
ner (Colin make sure
you're O N the beer that
week).

PIN
BOWLS
The last match of the
'73-'74 season was played
on Sunday at the Airport
Bowl. Despite a poor turn-
out by IC players the first
team managed to win their
two points. The second
team were less fortunate,
winning their first game
by only 5 pins, but losing
the other two by much the
same margin. The ladies
team, in the unfortunate
tradition of IC was weak,
but also managed to Win
one game. The final score
was: Portsmouth Poly 8,
IC 2.
Even more finally, there
is the dinner for a selec-
ted few, venue to-be ar-
ranged, and it will prob-
ably be during the week
of the 11th March. I
think it's a good do!

FOOTBALL
THIRDS TO
FINAL
Cup semi-final:
IC III 2 Birkbeck II 0
IC V 0 U C II 6
In a repeat of last year's final, IC thirds were drawn
against Birkbeck Seconds in the semi-final last Satur-
day at Kings ground. IC won the toss and elected to
play with the wind in the first half. The Thirds had
the better of the opening minutes and took an early
lead. From a shot (centre?) the ball rebounded off
Birkbeck's goalkeeper for Rob Holmes to nip in and
score. IC increased their lead after twenty-five minutes
when a throw-in was headed on by Tony Richards for
Mike Butterworth to score.
In the second half, playing now against a gale force
wind, IC got completely on top and should have
increased their lead, but a Tony Richards penalty was
brilliantly saved by the Birkbeck goalkeeper. IC kept
up the pressure and would have won by a higher
score but for several fine saves by the opposing goal-
keeper.
The defence played well throughout the game and
Ian McDermott and Rob Holmes had excellent games.
Team: Gerwyn Edwards, Chris Anastasi, Rick Per-
ret, Andy Jackson (capt.), Jim Isley, lan McDermott,
Tony Richards, Mike Jakeman, Rob Holmes, Mike
Buttercup, Phil Singleton. Sub lan Hyslop.
Meanwhile at Birkbeck hopes of an all IC final
vanished. Unaccustomed to an oval ball IC found
themselves two down after ten minutes. A very enthus-
iastic Fifth team fought hard with Brian Cassey having
a good game on the wing. It wasn't until the final
fifteen minutes that they were overwhelmed.
Team: Rob Colston, Tony Wilkinson (capt), Denis
Craig, Roger Hunter, Alan Wilkinson, Ken Cowan, A .
Handa, Rob Mills, Brian Causey, Ian Hasswell, S.
Dhillon.
The thirds now take on U C seconds in the final at
Motspur Park on Saturday 9th March. Free coaches
will be available for supporters. The third team deserve
their success this year. They have twice beaten the
second team (Never mind Alan). Their defence is
solid and ever reliable, the midfield is skilful and
determined and the forwards shooting is deadly. Andy
Jackson as captain has been an inspiration to all.

Of the three epic confrontations twixt these two
ambitious bodies of men, this was by far the most
significant. Unlike previous encounters, on this momen-
tous occasion (15 down, anag), elementwise everything
was A O K (colloquialism (colonial))
The opening instinctive parry and thrust were so
fluid that onlookers (Mr. Thrib and dog (mongrel with
terrier extractions)) were positive that all had been
rehearsed. To quote Mr. Thrib, "int' firstarf, t'eds was
wellontop. I canna' ft' life o'me compre'end 'ow
t'blues was a'ed at 'arftime."
The undeserved penalty to which Mr. Thrib so elo-
quently referred, was donated by the ref. (Neasden's
school for the blind) with but a meagre three seconds
to go. This injustice was not without repercussions (or
rewoodwinds). The normally subtle, delicate, controlled
footwork of Karol Senkiw was supplemented by certain
homicidal tendencies. Mick Butterworth (whose dive
caused the controversy) was mistaken by Mr. Senkiw
(patent pending) for Ian McDermott, the latter spend-
ing most of the 2nd half in orbit.
The telepathic congress realised within the 2nds in
their crushing of Q E C 2, again came to their aid
towards the end of the 2nd half, the 3rds, pushed back
on their heels by the 2nds (t'reds — E. Thrib), super-
human pressure were left breathless by the crisp, inci-
sive, simplicity of the reds equaliser. Ashen lipped,
tight faced Alan Peterson (83), took a corner so cun-
ningly deceptive that the 3rds defence thought the dan-
ger had passed. The desired complacence allowed Rob
Young (chief 'offender' in the earlier sequence) to cross
a perfectly flighted ground pass which Martin Clark
eloquently allowed to roll between his knees. A mer-
curial flash was upon the loose ball instantly, leaving
Andy Jackson scything at thin air, and pausing merely
to assess the most aesthetically satisfying point at which
the ball should enter the net, the flasher (alias Bob Day
-—Sports Ed.) miskicked it past flailing Andy Roberts.
Justice was done, Mr. Thrib re-awoke, his plaudits
echoed as the setting sun highlighted the blood on Mr.
Senkiw's boots, and the understandably biased referee
blew the third of his final whistles. The conflict is
past; only the recurrent pettiness of Arkle towards
Clarkle (and vice-versa) will remain to perpetuate the
memory of this tribute to incoherent, inhumane, vio-
lence. God must decide twixt vendicator and vindicated.
