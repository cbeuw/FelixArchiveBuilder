FENCING
The end of last term saw IC fencing Club at
King's College for a four weapon match. The after-
noon started in lively style with the men's sabre and
the ladies foil. The IC sabre team of Steve Thomp-
son, Gustavo di Chapella and Roman Gomez soon
took the lead with Gustavo and Roman's Olympic
experience showing out, the results being 8 wins and
1 defeat for IC.
The ladies did equally well despite their lacking a
third member (come back Carol—we need you), with
Kay Nicholson (2 wins) and Julia Harris, who did
very well to win all her fights. The result was 5 wins
to 1 in IC's favour. This early substantial lead had
an impressive psychological effect on King's and
gloomy faces were to be seen in the enemy camp.
The men's foil followed with the IC team of Geoff
Kolbe (1 win), Julia Tyson (2 wins) and Lawrence
Boyd (1 win) and the epee with Steve (0 wins!),
Andrew Barbut (1 win) and Julian (3 wins)—both
these were much more closely fought and had it not
been for our early lead would have produced a much
more exciting match. IC won by an overall margin
of 21 to 12. This was was made all the more impres-
sive because it was Kings' first defeat for two years.
A men's second foil team was also held with Gor-
don Mackay (2 wins), Jon Absalom (3 wins) and
Richard Annett (3 wins) producing a very good win
over King's seconds.
Afterwards we retired to a local pub where we were
entertained, by ourselves. IC also entered a team
for the Sporting Record men's national foil team
championship. This proved to be very great fun despite
the high standard of the competition. On Saturday
we met Stanhope ' A ' team and were defeated by
12 fights to 4, however the R A F was eliminated from
our pool and we were through to the Sunday rounds.
This was by direct elimination and based on seeding
from the Saturday. By the devious higher maths in-
volved we again found ourselves against Stanhope
'A'. Although we put up a better fight we lost at
9 defeats to 4. We may not have the most expert team
but the cries of ' I C and 'Imperial' were frequently
heard through the de Beaumont centre. The team
was Steve Thompson, Andrew Barbut, Richard
Annett and Lawrence Boyd.
At the end of last term the club dinner was held.
We decided to break away from college and went to
a hotel in Earl's Court where our ents committee
of Chris Murray and Steve Thompson had made very
good arrangements and a very enjoyable evening was
had by all and the late licence was made good use
of. We were especially- pleased that our instructor,
Akos Moldoranyi, and our President, Prof. J. L . Knill

EDITORIAL
IC once again show their superiority over other
London Colleges. The Rugby 1st X V have reached
the Gutteridge Cup Final for the 5th (correct me if
I'm wrong) time in succession (3 wins so far). They
meet Royal Free Hospital in the final whom they
have already beaten 63-10 earlier in the season, but
no doubt the final will be closer than that. Thanks
to the lads who wrote the report, sorry to interrupt
your victory celebrations.
The Football 3rd X I reached the final of the Upper
Divisions Cup for the second year running (much
to the dismay of the 2nd XI). They have a tough
game against U C 2nd. Good luck in the final at Mot-
spur Park on March 9th.
The Hockey team were also playing a cup match
today (Feb. 13th) but not having appeared with a
match report I can only assume they either lost, and
daren't show their faces in the bar, or else they won
and were too drunk to write a report. Perhaps the
promised article will appear by next Felix. Which
reminds me, What happened to the Badminton piece?
I hope to receive articles from the Squash Club, Boat
Club, and the Darts Club for the next issue. Also our
sportswomen are going to produce something (?)
with a bit of luck. Contributions are required from
all clubs, about 300 words long, has your club ap-
peared in Felix yet? Well, don't just sit there, write
something.
Finally, a plug for the Cricket Club. Their dinner
is on Wednesday, March 6th, guest speaker Arnold
Long, please get in touch with Pete Totterdall if in-
terested.
BOB B.
and Mrs. Knill were able to come along.

Universities White Water Race
Friday might and by closing time the team was
scattered between a pub in Llangollen and London
(also in a pub?). Those who had arrived at our dest-
ination in wild and woolly Wales made a further ex-
pedition into the hills, to the house of a sheep-farm-
ing friend.
By Saturday morning the whole team had made it
and we all rolled back down to Llangollen to have
a practice on the dreaded white-water racing course
that the Dee provides. The river was high, with recent
rain and even before the 'Serpent's'Tail' had been,
reached, everyone had been soaked by 2 foot waves.
The 'Serpent's Tail' is a narrow ohannel of water
through rock, with large waves culminating in a
three foot stopper which literally stops you before it
sucks you back into itself. There are two ways through
this, the 'chicken shoot' or a 'quick sprint and pray'.
Several paddlers swam, here and alt the following
series of weirs and rapids which came before the
Llangollen Town Falls. Once there, those who were
still left got out and inspected the famed international
course before wishing each other luck and shooting
the rapids (much to their own surprise and everybody
elses). Again a few people decided that boats were
unnecessary including John who was just unlucky. He
was paddling across the finishing line which the
organisers were still erecting, and was unfortunately
'felled' by a waist high rope, (oops!) John's only swim
of the weekend.
That afternoon was the team event, and the ' A '
team managed to come 14th taking 20 mins. to
cover the 2i mile course of hungry water. The even-
ing was spent chasing sheep and training in the pub..
Sunday came, and with the river still high (or
possibly higher) it was time for the individual event;
and some people managed to finish the course. In
fact 120 people were entered for the men's individual
and only 58 finished. John Hubbard managed a gootl
11th place, T i m Perry 35th, and Dave Rosenthal 47th.
The rest swam or chickened out. Dave and Tim
braved the course in new Canadian Double (thanks to
U L U for the loan of) and twice got down the course,,
though pessimists thought that ithey never could, to
succeed in getting a 2nd place.
Next year we hope to persuade Diana to get wet
and Bob Evans to complete the course the right way
up. Thanks to the supporters, cooks, mediics, and the
U L U teams.

World energy demand doubled between
1950 and 1970 and at present is doubling
every 15 years. But Britain has enough coal
under the ground to last at least another
1 0 0 years at the current rate of extraction.
In the years ahead the Coal Industry will
have the major role to play in providing
Britain's industry with essential power. To
help us in this important job w e need many
graduates of several disciplines to help
organise and manage the business of coal.
