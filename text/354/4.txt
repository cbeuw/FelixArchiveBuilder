If there is one thing
this election is not about,
it is the miners' pay claim.
The miners are only the
scapegoat, the excuse for
Heath to cut and run for
it, away from the prob-
lems he has created in 3J
years of Tory misrule.
This is not to say that
the miners claim is not
justified, or is not impor-
tant. Heath's rigid stand
— to the extent of impos-
ing a lock out on the rest
of the working class of
this country — typifies
what is wrong with the
Government. Even Tory
industrialists are finding
Heath's inflexibility hard
to swallow, as the £80,000
a day offer by Mr. Brad-
man showed. But the
three day week has only
compounded an already
bad situation, of soaring
inflation, massive balance
of payments deficit, wages
held back while prices
rise.
Tlie Housing Finance
Act and the Industrial
Relations Act had the in-
tended effect in the first
period of Tory govern-
ment, of dividing the
working class against
itself But with unity re-
turning, the stockmarket
falling and oil prices ris-
ing, Heath found himself
unable to hold his own
against his problems, and
so ran away.
This election is basi-
cally about democracy,
justice, and socialism. We
have seen an arbitary
Government invite Solz-
henitzen, the Soviet dissi-
dent, to this country,
whi'e deporting Chilean
refugees, and decreeing
that the rights of people
against planners should
be disregarded in the case
of the Scottish oil plat-
forms — to say nothing
of the dictate which has
reduced the working
week, and thus the wages
Of working people.
The Tory election man-
ifesto goes further along
that road. They will
decree, if they are re-
turned, that unfurnished
tenants who live in the
same house as their land-
lord are no longer to
have security of tenure —
though any local council-
lor will tell you that such
tenants are the ones who
have major problems in
persuading their landlords
to do proper repairs and
maintenance. Now, if they
call in the Public Health
department, under the
Tory proposals they will
be out on the street.
The Tories propose to
remove the right to social
security benefit from stri-
kers and their families —
although the benefit is
paid for by the workers
themselves partly straight
from their wage packet,
partly from the turnover
S u e W a r d , C h e l s e a
their labour produces.
They "will examine fur-
ther means of controlling
the rise in prices of key
items of food" — a pro-
mise that they ought to
be able to keep, since it
means nothing.
What is there to make
one vote Labour rather
than abstain, vote Liberal,
or vote for a minority
candidate? Such action,
of course, is not a waste
of a vote — it is a vote
for the Tories. If you
want to put the Tories
back into power, go
ahead.
The Labour Party's
period of office 1964-70
left many people feeling
disillusioned and believ-
ing a Labour governm r t
would always be domin-
ated by the Treasury. Will
this be the same again?
I do not believe it would
— the Party has learnt
from experience, and
there is a strong deter-
mination at the grass
roots of the Party never
to let it be "blown off
course" again. Conference
has been swinging stead-
ily left since 1970, and
there is a real will to bind
the Parliamentary party
to conference decisions.
A Labour Government
will face a tremendously
difficult time. We have
no doubt that there will
be problems, and that
even redeeming our pro-
mise to put up pensions
immediately will not be
easy. But it is possible to
cut back on inflation —
?
as John Palmer showed,in
the Guardian on Feb 13,
up to 75% of commodity
price rises have been cau-
sed by speculators mov-
ing into these markets —*
the disease is carried by
parasites endemic to the
capitalist system, at least
as much as by the onion
fly or potato blight. It is
possible to stop property
speculation, by national-
ising development land,
as the Labour Party is
pledged to do. It is possi-
ble to tax the wealthy to
pay for this — if you tax
real wealth, and capital,
you can get far more than
the £400m. Torty Barber
has suggested as the max-
imum, because he has
only looked at income.
There is plenty of wealth
and capital salted away in
our grossly unequal soci-
ety.
This is a crisis election
in a time of crisis. Five
more years of Tory Gov-
ernment would be disas-
trous. Even a year of
vague government, with
no one party holding an
absolute majority, would
be worse. The only tiling
that can take us forward
to a just and equal society
is a strong Socialist gov-
ernment.

Whilst arranging the meeting to be held in the Great
Hall today at 1.00 p.m. it seemed an eminently good
idea to ask each speaker to write an article for publi-
cation in Felix.; These are general articles dealing with
the poKeies of the three main parties and not with
specifically local issues. Read them, take note of what
they say and don't forget to come along to the meeting
in the Great Hall. Written questions please by 11.30
to the Union Office, Beit Building.

Tory Fundamentals
This Election has been
precipitated by the crisis
situation whereby a tiny
minority of politically
motivated extremists are
responsible for the use of
industrial force in an
attempt to torpedo the
fight against inflation by
a democratically elected
Government. In such cir-
cumstances the will of the
nation must be made plain
and it is to be hoped that
when this has been done,
there will be a new clim-
ate in Which the voices of
moderation lead to a
settlement. However, the
miners' strike is not the
only issue. A n Election is
a choice between differing
concepts of life and it is
useful therefore to restate
now the basic Tory philo-
sophy.
First—'Man cannot be
made perfect by human
action — Private relation-
ships are difficult to regu-
late by law and it is futile
to assume that social im-
provements alone will
alter .behaviour.
Second—Man does not
live alone—(but in a Soci-
ety whose first need is the
preservation of order.
Order will !be difficult to
maintain if the organs of
society do not work justly,
but justice is impossible
without order. For years
we have let woolly liberal
theories make us soft and
some sharp shocks may be
necessary for the modern
unruly, if a sane society is
to be rebuilt.
Third—The true life of
the Community is to be
found in the natural
groupings within society—j
family, occupational asso-
ciation, church, nation
and any wider culture of
which that nation may be
part. Attempts to disrupt
such natural ties should he
resisted, especially when
the education process is
being perverted to over-
throw the basis of society.
Fourth—Society is not
static—but to be healthy
must develop organically
rather than by revolu-
tions. Rulers are trustees
of the past and for the
future. This involves
greater care for our en-
vironment as well as
healthy scepticism about
the wisdolm of replacing
institutions of proven
worth with ephemeral pro-
ducts of trendy theories.
Fifth—Economics is a
tool not a master—Eco-
nomic dogmas whether
capitalist or socialist are
to be treated accordingly.
Times change and while
sometimes more interven-
tion in the operation of a
free market is needed, at
other times it should be
less. No " U " turns are in-
volved: those who think
they are have a fallacious
view of Toryism in the
first place.
Sixth—The organs of
society must control the
life of the community in
the interests of the whole
for the betterment of the
lot of all members as op-
posed to separate parts.
Tory philosophy has al-
ways advocated state in-
tervention to help the
weak and needy.
Seventh—A well order-
ed community will pro-
vide a framework for the
maximum development of
individual personality —
Private property is not
sacrosanct above the
needs of the community
but it is justified as a
means of developing the
individual personality, the
safeguard of the family,
an incentive to production
and increase of wealth,
and a natural bulwark of
liberty. Attacks on it
whether from public or
private corporations are
suspect.
Eighth—If power (poli-
tical and economic) and
authority are not to be
abused, they must be
spread as widely as pos-
sible throughout the com-
munity —• If we wish to
preserve the concept of
one nation it needs to be
made a reality by involv-
ing to the fullest the ordi-
nary people in the affairs
of the community. In so
doing we maintain the
tradition of Disraeli, the
later Churchills and Mac-
millan. It remains the
best, the middle way, for
the country.

The Liberal Party mani-
festo "Forward with the
Liberals" gives a clue to
the strength and resilience
Of the revival of the
Liberal Party and why
this is gathering momen-
tum day by day. Liberal
policy is not simply some
middle of the road be-
tween the Tories on the
right and Labour on the
left. It is at the same time
more constructive than
l o r y policy and more
radical than Labour. Dur-
ing the last year there has
been a dramatic change in
the British political scene
which has not yet been
fully perceived. Previous
elections and changes of
government had seen two
major parties moving
closer together as they
vied with each other for
the expanding middle class
vote. Industries were de-
nationalised and re-nat-
ionalised. British society
continued to be charac-
terized by sharper class
divisions and inequalities
in incomes and wealth
than in any other country
among the major indus-
trialised nations. But
when, due to years of
neglect, our deteriorating
industrial relations led to
increasingly inflationary
wage demands and in-
creasingly damaging in-
dustrial disruption, cul-
minating in the Govern-
ment's self-imposed 3-day
week, the Tories and
Labour moved back into
diametrically opposed
camps.
In an address to the
Liberal Summer School at
Cambridge in 1925, J. M .
Keynes asked the ques-
tion that faces the British
electorate now; whether
there was any room for a
party disinterested as be-
tween classes which would
be free in building the
future from the Die-hard-
ism of the Tories and from
the Catastrophism of Lab-
our each of which spoil
the constructions of the
other. He answered in the
affirmative, but at no
time has it been so vital
to re-establish the voice of
reason as now. Until re-
cently it was possible for
people of Liberal persua-
sion to find a political
home in the wing of one
of the other two parties.
This is no longer the case.
At that time the Liberal
Party did not appear to be
a viable political force.
This is not true today. We
believe that by failing to
legislate for a society that
is fair the Tories have lost
the confidence of working
people and that if return-
ed to power would be
faced with the worst in-
dustrial strife since the
war. But equally a Labour
victory would spell eco-
nomic ruin. Labour has
become extremely illib-
eral; falling into the
hands of the leadership of
the most powerful trade
unions and turning its
back on the benefits of
economic growth to be
had from the expanded
market of the E.E.C.
Liberals are facing
squarely the fundamental
problems of our day. We
are concerned to combine
the maximum freedom for
the individual with protec-
tion against the exercise
of one person's freedom
infringing the freedom of
others. We are concerned
to establish a society that
is fair. On industrial rela-
tions we have consistently
advocated Industrial Part-
nership since the famous
Liberal Yellow Book of
1928. The monopoly pow-
ers of trade unions will
have to be restrained but
this will only be achieved
in return for greater par-
ticipation in industry and
a fairer distribution of
wealth. The latter could
be achieved by the pro-
gressive issue of shares
or equivalent production
linked agreements to em-
ployees. Employees would
then have an incentive to
work more effectively and
at last we would be work-
ing with each other rather
than against each other
as we have done under the
last thirty years of Tory
and Labour rule. Liberal
leadership in Community
Politics has also demon-
strated that we are pre-
pared and able to translate
our concern for people's
rights into practical re-
sults. The Liberal revival
started with radical poli-
tics and students' concern
to get something done.
Now it is the students'
turn to respond; to reject
the old classification of
left and right; and to help
us unite this country.
PUBLICITY
Have you ever wonder-
ed if the Union ever does
anything? Y o u never see
any posters do you? In
fact, the publicity depart-
ment in this college is
pretty useless isn't it?
Good! I'm glad you
agree but I am trying
hard to improve the situa-
tion. However one of my
biggest problems is distri-
bution.
Coming straight to the
point I need volunteers to
pin up posters. Nobody
will be asked to go out of
their way at all, posters
and pins will be delivered
to you personally, one
poster per person, and you
would be asked to pin it
up on a notice board you
pass regularly.
So if you want to help
send a note to the Im-
perial College Union
(Publicity Dept.), by in-
ternal mail, i.e. hand it to
a college messenger, or
just drop it into the office
in the Beit archway. In-
clude details of notice
boards you pass daily in
college, hall, bars, etc. and
your address and depart-
ment so that I can con-
tact you, and before I for-
get your name would be
useful as well!
Thanks Rup.
