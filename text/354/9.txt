by the G D B A . This per-
mits the collection of
much more substantial
material such as millings
and turnings in workshops
(contamination with oil/
lubricant is no problem),
aluminium beverage cans,
collapsible tubes (provid-
ed they are not plastic
covered), or just the ends
and rings of steel bodied
cans, and any other hea-
vier gauge aluminium
scrap. So don't just con-
fine your collection to
foil, the latter material is
much more substantial.

take it to G D B A yourself,
send or bring it to Clive

C o u n c i l R e p o r t
Having been reviewing
the "pop" concerts for
quite some time now I de-
cided to take a step in a
different direction, to ex-
pand my horizons, so to
speak. Now I'd never been
to an opera before, though
from the little knowledge
I did possess I understood
G & S to be the best in-
troduction, so along I went
for my initiation.
On making my way to
my seat I noticed that quite
a few of the audience were
not students. Whether
this was because they were
good dutiful friends of
those involved, or because
the name of IC Operatic
Society spreads far and
wide I don't know. 1
could well believe the lat-
ter, as everything seemed
very professionally done.
The scenery really looked
like trees and stone walls
and didn't wobble on con-
tact, the costume and
make-up was splendid, the
two-dozen-or-so strong or-
chestra, dressed smartly in
black, accompanied ably
throughout, and everyone
On stage knew their parts
backwards.
Act One was a short one,
situated in the castle of
King Hildebrand, who re-
minded me very much
of King Richard III for
some reason. He remained
stern and serious through-
out, and, in fact, I didn't
see him smile once. The
plot was soon revealed:
that his son Hilarion had
been betrothed to Princess
Ida, who had since re-
nounced all men, and was
living in the Castle Ada-
mant — a college for mai-
dens who had been trained
to think likewise.
Princess Ida's father,
King Gama, made an early
appearance With his three
sons, who were dressed in
armour, and every time
they moved they sounded
like a dozen skeletons on
tin roofs throwing empty
beer cans at each other.
King Gama (intended to
be a repugnant cripple,
though I felt rather sorry
for him—still, I even took
pity on Galium), had a
very amusing part to play
(I especially enjoyed his
"grumbling song" and his
sons had a jolly song be-
fore being led off to the
dungeons.
Act Two opened in the
gardens of Castle Adamant
to a chorus of sweetly
singing maidens, belittling
men to record levels. The
leading ladies were also
soon revealed — Lady
Psyche, Lady Blanche
(professor of abstract sci-
ences, and easily believed
from the pompous way she
talked) and her daughter
Melissa. It may well be
my imagination but it
seemed to me that the less
accomplished singers sang
the least serious songs
most. Anyway, the Prin-
cess made her entrance
with a fairly serious song.
The highlight of the
evening for me came when
Cyril, Florian and Hilarion
broke into the deserted
gardens, donned some of
the women's matriculating
gowns, which just happen-
ed to be at hand and ca-
vorted about in mock
grace, each having sung
beforehand to rapturous
applause. Indeed, so good
was this that it not only
made the orchestra smile,
who must have seen it a
million times already, but
they were forced to re-
enact some of it.
The curtains rose for
the third and final time to
reveal the maidens physi-
cally prepared to defend
the castle against the men,
Ethiopia

letter) Council agreed to

it.

Orders

Council members will be
able to send a representa-

half. This representative
to be a member of the
same group etc. that the
original Council member
represented.
Finance
Council approved the
request for £270 for Ra-
dio Society for a new
short - wave transceiver.
Discussion took place on
the suggestion that invest-
ment be made in up to 100
pewter tankards, due to
the rate of increase of
their cost. This was agreed
to. It was also decided
that further investigations
should be made into buy-
ing a large stock of dupli-
cating paper.

paring a list of this term's

Gloria George, the ex-
pelled SOAS student.
S. Africa
There was a brief dis-
cussion regarding firms

views within the college
and Mr. Phillips had pre-
pared a draft of a letter
that encouraged students
to, if possible, avoid these
firms.
I.SO

the London Student Org-
anisation convenors was
present and spoke and an-
swered questions about
LSO.

up and have a review at
the first Council of 74/75
session.

paper suggesting t h a t
there should be a chair-

gestion was carried nem
com.

report referring to future
Union organisation and
financing. Council agreed,
in principle, to the ap-
pointment of a Union
Manager and the purch-
ase of offset litho equip-
ment. It was also agreed
that all applications for
equipment grants should
be received by the first
week in November of each
year.

though perhaps their men-
tal approach left much to
be desired. This was dis-
played by some lovely act-
ing and facial expressions
of Melissa as she sang of
her Views on the matter.
Could it all end without
a fight between the men?
Of course not, so our three
heroes duly thrashed
Gama's three sons (having
trouble at times to hit
each Other's swords), Prin-
cess Ida eventually ad-
mitted her mistake, also
after some good facial ex-
pressions, married Hilarion
and they all lived happy
ever after —• Aaah!

AS IT WAS
F E B R U A R Y 19,1954
The RCS Union Meet-
ing held on Monday Feb-
ruary 8th proved to be a
much quieter affair than
has been the custom of
late. No inter-planetary
rockets were demonstra-
ted, although a bombshell
was exploded by Malcolm
Campbell, who claimed
to be able to explain the
fact that Fanny, the
shapely Union mascot,
had had a baby.
NUS
I.C. were affiliated in
December of 1922 but dis-
affiliated in November of
1926, after NUS had
asked the Union to in-
crease the affiliation fee
from £30 to £60 (it's now
£1,800—Ed.). The Union
re-affiliated in the year
prior to the war but by
1939 differences had again
occurred. A motion by the
IC General Committee
deplored the political tone
of the NUS. Consequent-
ly IC dis-affiliated in 1940.
In 1948, re-affiliation was
proposed. This was defea-
ted on the grounds that
NUS did nothing but
throw abuse and threats
at its own country and
that its poltical leanings
were undesirable.
F E B R U A R Y 19,1959
Due to lack of copies, I
was not able to find a
copy of this week.
F E B R U A R Y 19, 1964
Contrary to reports in
Sennet and the Evening
Standard, neither the Bea-
tles nor Gerry and the
Pacemakers have been
booked for this years
carnival.
Sports Centre
The University Grants
Committee have been
considering the sports
centre designs since May
1963. The U G C is contri-
buting £70,000 towards
the £205,000 cost, IC
Union is supplying £5,000.
Deputy President
Heated argument yes-
terday over the pros and
cons of electing a deputy
president from the Union
floor at the A G M resulted
in failure to gain the
necessary two-thirds ma-
jority vote for the motion.
Apathy
The issues of Felix for
the last ten or so years all
carry accounts of the de-
pressed state of the Un-
ion, and the efforts of
each successive President
to remedy this. Council
meetings appear to have
been much the same —
"highly ridiculous".
F E B R U A R Y 20, 1969
There will be a referen-
dum throughout the col-
lege on Monday Febru-
ary 24th to answer 'yes'
or 'no' to the following
questions:—
1. Do you believe that the
Constituent College
Unions should exist?
2. Do you believe that
I C W A should exist?
3. Do you believe that the
Union E x e c u t i v e
should exist?
4. Do you believe that
I C U should join NUS?
5. Do you believe that the
president should have
a sabbatical year? (He
didn't at the time —
Ed.).
6. Do you believe that
the departmental repre-
sentatives should be on
council? (They weren't
at the time—Ed.).
RCS Dinner
This years Guest of
Honour at the Annual
Royal College of Science
dinner will be H R H , the
Duke of Edinburgh.
LEA TO PAY ALL
One of the Welsh Edu-
cation A u t h o r i t i e s ,
G W E N T , may introduce
a new system of student
grants which will chal-
lenge the Government.
They wish to introduce a
standard figure of grant
for all students which
would not be subject to
the parental means test.
The education commit-
tee's proposal to abolish
the means test is at the
moment being costed by
the council.
Mr. Oliver James, the
leader of the controlling
Labour group has said
that he expects the DES
to intervene to try to
block the idea, but at the
moment they arc deter-
mined to carry it through.
Gwent Education A u -
thority has already re-
fused to implement the
20 per cent cut in their
education budget that the
Government demanded of
all L E A ' s before Christ-
mas. But they seem quite
prepared to do battle with
the DES as well, in the
interests of minimising the
current differences in
grant levels that students
face.
Mr. James said: " A t
present there are great
differences between stu-
dents in different types of
colleges and there are so
many different factors
that determine the size of
grant. We feel that if we
can broaden our attitude
to students and say that
a grant is theirs of their
own right without re-
gard to their parents or
anyone else it would be
better".
