CONCERTS
SHORTLEG
AND DODLY
WHO, ASHLEY?
Shirley and Dolly — or Shortleg and
Dodly, to quote the contract — Collins
gave their farewell performance at I C
Folk Club Wednesday 30th Jan. A sad
occasion in some ways, but with various
pleasant surprises, probably the most
noltable being the appearance of Ashley
Hutchins — bass player from Steeleye
Span, Fairport Convention, and the
Albion Country Band amongst others,
for those of you who like myself I'm
ashamed to say were ignorant of this
fact.
There was an abundance of floor-sin-
gers, several newcomers to our club. Mr.
Gladstone's Bag — two friends of Shir-
ley and Dolly — were very popular and
we hope to have them back later this
term. That's a 'plug'. Their songs were
mostly humorous and at one time they
accompanied a member of the Albion
Morris Dancers—Dolly's husband. We
hope also that the Albion Morris Dan-
cers will return with M r . Gladstone's
Bag. Shirley and Dolly themselves sang
traditional ballads for the most, these
including the one which named Steeleye
Span during which Shirley forgot the
words, and a cry of "Ashley, what are
the next words?" rang around the Low-
er Refec. Again for those of you who
didn't know (such lack of knowledge is
shameful for University Students!!?)
Shirley Collins is forming a new band
with Ashley Hutchins.
A l l in all, this concert was a success,
thoroughly enjoyed by everyone present,
if you massed out this time, keep a look
out for posters which may very well an-
nounce the return appearance of these
excellent entertaiiners.
SUTHERLAND BROTHERS
AND QUIVER
'What's all this then?' you may have
asked yourself if you went to last Fri-
day's concert. 'I remember when the
Suthererland Brothers were folk musi-
cians, and Quiver were a nice quiet
band.' I must confess I enjoyed them
more as they were, but, ours is not to
question why, the amalgamation has
now been fully completed, though there
is sitill a lot of jagged edges. 1 saw them
a year ago, and their music was just as
tight as it is now.
They started with a few noisy and
quite rough rockers (did they really
need three guitarists and three people
singing? — at least it might not have
been SB bad if they were harmonising).
The audience were very appreciative —
it must be something to do with the at-
mosphere. — You know, a smallish hall
jam-packed with hot sweaty bodies,
knee deep in Newky Brown. That put
me in a bad frame of mind to begin
wfch. as 1 prefer to listen to the music
in comfort.
These they followed with a nice slow
one, which they called bluesy, But when
another 12-bar followed I began to won-
der what had happened to all the good
music I was sure they were capable of
producing.
As it happened they'd saved it all
for the latter part of the performance.
One of the Sutherland Brothers changed
his guitar for a tambourine, and the lead
guitarist, if you see what I mean, made
use of his non-appearance at the begin-
ning to retune his guitar. The result was
much more melody (please excuse the
quote) with a nice tinkling piano in
the background, and after some time
Tim Renswick returned to carry on for
quite some more time as the song orien-
tated itself around his guitar work.
Soon came, inevitably, their two
singles '1 don't want to love you but
you got me anyway' and 'Sailing'
(written about the trip to see one's
Maker), which was necessarily changed
from its original version (would you be-
lieve a piano-accordion accompani-
ment?) to give the rest of the band
something to do.
To top this they added a very nice
treatment of 'Love is love and not fade
away', though they regressed (in my
opinion) to the noisy ones again for the
last few.
G J . K .
THEATRE
J U DIES
Comedy Thcot-re,
Panto St. SWT
In these days of strife, Judlies is
an excellent way to brighten the gloom.
The play is not one for those who like
to discuss the deep social comments in
Act 2 over a late meal. I can highly
recommend it to those who like a laugh
without stretching their minds.
The play stars John Alderton and his
wife, Pauline Collins, both late of ITV's
"Upstairs, Downstairs", and is set in
a two-girls-sharing flat somewhere north
of Watford. Inventive stage manage-
ment changes the set from the flat, to
a squash court gallery and then to a bar
by careful use of lighting alone.
The play revolves around the sex life
of two young teachers, and is rather like
a risque version of the "Liver Birds".
Alderton and Collins are clearly the
stars, but the supporting cast are let
down by their mediocre parts, although
they perform these well. The play only
runs for about 110 minutes, but it is
certainly packed with humour through-
out<
"Judies" is one of the best comedies
I have seen on the London stage for
many months. Highly recommended.
RECORDS
ELEPHANTS
MEMORY
ANGELS FOREVER
"Let's get one thing straight — Ele-
phant's Memory are the band who
backed John Lennon during his initial
days in New York, the band that effec-
tively became the Plastic Ono Band!
So says the opening lines of the pub-
licity handout. 1 may not be the most
knowledgeable person in the college re-
garding these things, but there are some
facts that most record reviewers know.
Maybe having had to be thought of
as "John Lennon's backing band" has
not helped them. No doubt their earlier
albums are worth having in their own
right, but it is through JL's "Sometime
in New York City" that they are really
known.
On listening to their latest offering,
"Angels Memory", this seems to be
rather a shame. They don't need J L
to give them a name. Their music is
sufficient on its own.
Elephant's Memory consist of Rick
Frank on drums; Stan Bronstein on
saxophone and vocals; Gary von Seyoc.
bass and vocals; Chris Robison, key-
board, guitar and vocals; and Jonathan
Sachs, guitar and vocals, and the group
have done the rounds of companies be-
fore reaching Polydor (through Buddah,
Metromedia, Apple). On the way they
were responsible for the music in "Mid-
night Cowboy" (theme music excluded).
The record can be summed up as con-
sisting of good, strong rock 'n roll.
There's no beating about the bush with
subtleties, niceties or fancy frills. The
drums are steady and combine with the,
other percussion to give a good rhythm
that is impossible to not get caught up
in. Put this record on in the presence
of a few people who didn't know the
group and they'd first think that they
recognise the artistes and then, forget-
ting that, they'd most likely be joining,
in with the beat. A good bet for parties.
A good rocking album which should,
if given enough airplay and opportunity
help fix Elephant's Memory on the
scene as Elephant's Memory and not
JL's backing band.
