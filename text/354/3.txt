UNMARRIED
STUDENT MOTHERS
The NUS and the National Council for One-
Parent Families are gravely concerned that the new
Hardship Scheme for the dependants of students,
introduced by the DES last July, discriminates against
the single (unmarried) mother and her dependants.
There are very serious defects for her and her child
in the new mandatory arrangements for students'
dependants. A divorced, separated or widowed mother
with one child, Who married before her course began,
may claim up to £350 allowance or may opt for a
special disregard of income. A mother in exactly the
same position but who has never been married can
! claim only £144.30. This is blatant discrimination
I against the single (unmarried) mother and her child.
The NUS and One-Parent Families call upon the
Government to review the grant arrangements for
! one-parent families so that the single (unmarried)
mother or the unmarried father bringing up his child
| may claim the full child allowance, the extra personal
allowance of £100 available to divorced or separated
mothers or the special disregard of income. We also
request that financial help be given towards the extra
unavoidable costs which these families incur, such as
the cost of child care.
DEMONSTRATION
February 8th and N U S National Demonstration
Day. Funny, I must be in the wrong place. Surely
more than 70 people at Imperial College care enough
about their grants to protest about their low level. No!
Obviously no more are expected as Norm is sending
us all down to the Tube station.
Emerging out of the Tube again and approaching
the demonstration. My, aren't there a lot of people.
More than I've ever seen on a student demonstration
before (though small compared to the T U C demon-
stration of 150,000 some time ago). They seem very
peaceful though. Just as well, in fact, as the DES
headquarters are within storming distance and not
very well guarded by police at that.
Starting off and that's the front of the procession
that 1 can see ahead. No sign of the rear end however.
Walking past the DES, I wonder if SHE's there, in
One of the top windows watching. Unlikely. She's
•probably enjoying a highly subsidised meal in the
House.
Very quiet this time "Give me a G . . . . Give me
an R . . . ." etc., "What does it all spell? F*** a l l . . . . "
Strange how one's ideas change.I always thought
that most higher education students could at least spell
simpler words.
"Get back to work!" shouts a worker from one of
•he offices. Cries of "F*** off" (not sensible), and
"What would you do if you weren't being paid enough
io live on" (sensible).
Hyde Park and cries from the platform of "They're
still pouring out of Oxford Street. There's no end to
*he demonstration". 25,000 to 30,000 students waiting
to hear . . . Miner, building worker, Labour M.P. . . .
"Solidarity . . . struggle . . . support . . . strike . . .
"picketing . . . Funny sort of G R A N T S demonstration.
At last, John Randall, our glorious (?) leader. Not so
many boos as I thought there would be, though L S E
are making themselves heard (as usual).
Banner folded up, long trip home for some (Ire-
land, Scotland, Wales). Press coverage the next day.
Guardian carried a photo of Korean students demon-
strating . . . in Korea.
OVERSEAS
STUDENTS'
HOME BASED
DISCRIMINATION
A Mr. Imman studying
Maths and computers at
Southampton College of
Technology, who has been
in England since 1966,
went to Denmark for a
Christmas break. On
returning after Christmas
he was stopped at Gat-
wick and sent back to
Copenhagen. Copenhagen
refused to take him, and
he was returned to Gat-
wick again. He was sent to
the "Beehive detention
suite" and was left there
until January 25th when
after his case had b e e n
considered by the H o m e
Office he was flown to
Bangladesh. He has never
lived in Bangladesh. The
reason given was that he
had "a lack of incentive
to return home after his
studies". If he wishes to
appeal against this, he will
have to do so from Bang-
ladesh. A n appeal from
Bangladesh may take up to
a year to arrange.
Mr. Carr's speech on
immigration in the House
of Commons in December
seems already to have had
an effect. He then referred
to the danger of overseas
students seeing studying
as. "a backdoor way of
evading all immigration
control", He talked of
students "spinning out
their course, more w i t h
the intention of staying in
this country, than of
seriously obtaining g o o d
qualifications". The Gov-
ernment wishes to place
control on the total length
of time a student may
' spend here and on move-
ment from course to
course; to increase the
minimum number of
hours per week necessary
for student status (at
present 15 hours a week);
and to obtain more regu-
lar and frequent reports
from institutions where
students are working.
These controls coupled
with the recent report by
the Parliamentary Expen-
diture Committee, w h i c h
advocated charging over-
seas postgraduate students
the full costs of t h e i r
courses, which would be
in the region of £1,500 a
year, will add to the prob-
lems that overseas stud-
ents in this country
already experience.
ACCOMMODATION
QUESTIONNAIRE
Those of you living in
accommodation other than
Halls of Residence, Union
Flats or Student Houses
will shortly be receiving a
questionnaire w h i c h is
aimed at providing infor-
mation on the various
types of accommodation
occupied by Imperial Col-
lege students. The quest-
ionnaire will endeavour to
discover, amongst other
things, what sort of
accommodation you are
living in, whether you are
satisfied with it, any rest-
rictions imposed by t h e
landlord and whether the
landlord will accept an
increase in I.C. students
next session. It is intended
to draw up a register of
accommodation available.
The questionnaire will go
a long way to providing
the information only if a
large enough section of
T.C. participates. So, when
you receive it, please
oblige the college and the
union by taking a few
minutes off work to fill it
in.
K E I T H A R U N D A L E
(Student Residence
Officer)
STUDENTS?
Since October 1973, the
U C C A form (remember
that?) has invited appli-
cants to indicate whether
they live close enough to
one of their chosen uni-
versities to live at home
during their degree
course.
Giving evidence before
the education and the
arts sub-committee of the
Commons Expenditure
Committee, Mr. Ralph
Toomey, under-secretary,
DES universities branch,
agreed this information
might tip the balance of
choice between two other-
wise equal candidates to-
wards the one who could
live at home.
It seems that the Gov-
ernment (as was) were
trying to implement the
1972 White Paper, and
that the universities are
showing more sympathy
towards the proposals. A l l
is not working as they
would like, however, as
some schools, realizing
the implications of the
question, are instructing
their pupils not to com-
plete this section on the
form.
PARTY
SPEECH
"Hello, good afternoon, this is your local, er . . . .
where are my notes . . . . er . . . . Labour Party
candidate." (I must remember it's Labour this time,
I was a Liberal last time and a Tory before that, it's
all the same really but it doesn't do well to let the
electorate know that). "I hope you'll all be voting
Labour on Thursday 28th and put an end to this
Tory misrule."
"What do we promise, you ask? That's easy, we're
good at promises. Well first of all we'll stop strikes.
The Tories can't do that, the workers can see that
the Tories are against them. The unions will accept
our promises. I know that we can't give them any-
thing but it'll take a while for them to realise that.
We'll have a Prices and Incomes policy and if they
don't like it we can always send the troops in. After
all we did that in 1966 in the seamen's strike, though
it's better not to remind people of that. I know it
sounds a bit like Tory policy but at least we can
pretend that we're acting in the interests of the
people.
"Then we'll solve the economic crisis. Don't ask
how, I'm not an economist. I'm sure someone will
thinik of something. Anyway it sounds good.
"What about the Common Market? Well, we're
waiting for the result of a special opinion poll before
we make up our minds on that one. Remember we
want to get elected.
" A n d don't forget our nationalisation programme.
We'll run every industry as efficiently as the Post
Office and make as much profit at the National Coal
Board. No . . . . wait a moment . . . . that's wrong,
er . . . . well, nationalisation's good, I just can't re-
member why.
"Student grants? Well N U S is telling students to
vote Labour already so we needn't promise anything
there. We gave students 6% in 1968. I know they
were supposed to have got 12% but they've probably
forgotten that now.
"Not that it really matters. Once we're in we can
forget all our promises and get down to the business
of ruling the country. It doesn't matter who gets in
really. Whoever it is is going to have to take strong
measures to preserve the capitalist system and pre-
vent workers getting decent wages. Though we've
got to make it look like there's a choice or the
workers might get wise to the fact that they don't
need the capitalist system and then where would we
be? I'd lose my high salary for a start. Of course
all the Trotskyists and Communist Party people are
telling the workers to vote Labour. That helps. They
can always be counted on to support capitalism in the
end. Anyway that's enough for now. Vote Labour
and perhaps this time Til get elected.
"This is your local Labour Party candidate. (I've
got it right this time). Good-bye for now".
