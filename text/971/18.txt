Miscellaneous

Dominic exposes his dour northern soul
'And now the end is near and so I
face the final curtain ', as dear
old Uncle Frank, or Sid Vicious
(isn't music the great leveller?)
would have said. Hurtling towards
the end of my year in office (a
quaint term since I spent a large
proportion of my time not being in
my office) the only thing I can say
is 'Can I breathe out now ?'
And so in summary
Ents and ting.
Having being involved with Ents
(but don't tell the missus) since the
day I set foot in Imperial I reckon
that this year has been the best. The
quality of entertainment has been so
pure you could have snorted it. The
good people of Ents put in so much
work, for so little recognition, I
wonder at times why they bother.
But that seems to be the way of the
world when things are going well.
People become used to being served
up with good nights out, until they
take them for granted. As far as the
Union is concerned Ents have been
hauled over the coals this year and
at times I have had to put my head
in my hands and wished the ground
would swallow me up. Naivety and
the dizzy heights of authority can
be intoxicating. To some members
of staff and to future sabbaticals I
profer the advice listen to Ents,
do not pontificate, they know what
they're doing. And remember.,
without Ents there would be no
heaving Wednesday and Friday
nights, few bar extensions and little
of that money we all like to spend.
If Ents went on strike tommorow
where would we be? THINK
ABOUT IT. And just for the
record. Please give them a decent
budget. Jesus would find it difficult
to keep the punters amused with the
money they have to work with.
The other events I have put on
this year have gone well and they
have been too numerous to mention.
Thankyou for showing up and
spending your grant wisely.
Rag.
My involvment with Rag this year
has been brief, bordering on tanga
brief. This doesn't though seem to
have stopped them making more
money than sense and I take my hat
off to them. They have at times
made errors of judgement that I
would put down to having limitless
supplies of boundless enthusiasm
and more limited supplies of
experience. We all make mistakes.
Critics of Rag would have them
'wacky' and irritating. At the end
of the day they raise large amounts
of cash that the disadvantaged
benefit from. How many of us
apathetic, lazy, self centred sloathes
will criticise that?
Elections a go-go.
We have at last four sabbaticals in
place for next year. Not that the vast
majority of students at Imperial
seem to care either way. The first
election turn out of 20% ish was
pretty remarkable and is about the
national average for student
elections. (At the sake of mutual
embarrassment I will not even
mention the second election). This
though is still too small. Excuse me
for being an out of touch old hippy
but isn't youth all about self
expression, making mistakes and
learning from them (or not),
experimentation, ranting and
raving, staying up past twelve
o'clock, not wearing Brian May t-
shirts, upsetting your parents,
dyeing your hair blue, eating badly,
drinking to Olympic standard (at the
tax payers expense) and POLITICS.
A worrying percentage of Imperial
students seem to have already rested
on their laurels and opted for the
Marks and Spencers comfy grey
cardie in their late teens and early
twenties. Get involved and make
some noise! If elected sabbatical
officers have the mandate to hood
wink, deceive, misinform and just
good old fashioned lie just think
what the goverment is doing to you.
On second thoughs I take this all
back. The Conservatives have been
doing precisely the above for over
thirteen years. Perhaps that's why
grey cardies are so popular?
I have a vision.
The future for Imperial College
Union is both equally grim and
rosy. The introduction of Voluntary
Membership could be the final nail
in the coffin for students. While
being unclear as to what the
goverment is offering (answers on
a postcard to John Patten MP) I
envisage tough times ahead. We
have never been about political
campaining here and so we have the
advantage. Representation and
services is where we're at and this
year has seen an increased emphasis
in both these areas. Next year we
will have a sabbatical ( A G M
willing) solely dedicated to
representing our club and athletic
interests. God knows we need one.
For too long College has shafted us
and got away with it because
sabbaticals have had neither the
time nor the inclination to do
anything about it. If any of the
doubting Thomas's think there is no
work for a new sabbatical just ask
Rachel Mountford (Rag) or Carl
Boon (ACC). We will also have a
new member of staff dedicated to
finding out what you want in terms
of services and events, and then
providing them. Maybe things
won't be that bad after all, but I've
noticed that stocks of tin hats and
shovels are running out fast at
Millets.
The Richard Attenboroughs.
At various times throughout this
year Jonty has begged me to write
him '500 words on anything'. In my
quest to be as unhelpful as possible
I offer him 500 words on a selection
of beautiful people
A l l the Union staff, Mandy
'mumsy' Hurford for being a pool
of understanding and delicate
infuriation, the Finance office
posse, Zona 'Iri I' O'Sullivan for
her never ending stream of put
downs, Pat Baker for her humour,
coffee and day files, Louise
'Gunner' Van Der Straeten for her
friendship, love of life, mutual
appreciation of Lowy and duff
footballing taste, Stef for never
letting me play in his football team,
Cathy and Michelle for listening,
reminding me that all men are
bastards, lease of their magazines,
unending supplies of sweeties and
goodies and ability to lie faultlessly
when I needed them to. Cathy 'you
were fantastic!'. Chris for his
bouncieness, green enthusiasm and
guts to drag the Union forward,
Rick for reminding me where the
missing link went. The Catering
collective, Ian Richards for being
a genuine caring human being and
buyer of pints, I will miss you,
Yvonne for being there (get your
boyfriend under control), Pete, you
are a true star, Steve, Ian 'north
bank', Emily, Liz and Terri. The
bar staff, Andrew 'sashe, sashe'
Flanagan for all his efforts and
'offers', keep the vibe alive,
Gervaise for behaving like the
tallest 2 year old in town, your
scowls have been truly
inspirational. Remember, when the
wind changes, you'll stick like that,
Marc, Andy P, Imran.
The Felix orchestra, Jonty, for fatty
coffee and a welcoming smile,
Dave Spoons, a renaissance man a
crushed velvet, Ian, Stef, Simon,
Steve, Andy for an accomodating
back passage and musical
reminiscenses (you may wear the
groove stone) and Rose (in the end
it took me a dictionary to find out
the meaning of unrequited love).
Andy Kerr, you may be small and
Irish but you'll do for me, BJ, a
stalwart, friend and alter ego.
Somebody somewhere loves you
both. Andy Nu, 'man of gaffer
tape', Ian ' M r Pickle' Nichol. Jill
'the bookstore' for appreciation,
coffee, clippers and chats, Denise,
Millie, Cathy, Ann (where did you
get that calender from?) and Fiona.
College refectories, doing batde has
been a pleasure. Stevie F for being
an Hon. Sec. when I needed him,
Rachel M , all the student officers
and those whom my memory has
not served well Kick off those
sling backs and enjoy!
Chris's final words
There is no more, the end is upon
us, but lots still to do. During this
week we will put the finishing
touches to the new plan for the
Union. Jonty's article last week
explained what is intended. This
will (wind in the right direction) be
implemented with the passing of the
new constitution at the Annual
General Meeting on Friday. A copy
of the new (draft) constitution will
be available from the Union office
from Thursday afternoon. We need
you there. I hope that the new
constitution will be clear, easy to
read, contain the minimum of
legalistic nonsense and will take the
Union a step closer to the students.
One last bit of business. There is
a council meeting on Wednesday at
2pm in the concert hall of the Union
Building. You are very welcome to
attend. There we will run through
a draft of the constitution, amending
it so that the General Meeting will
take as little time as possible. Please
come along.
Finally, this year has been
unbelievable for me but would have
been nothing if it were not forihose
who have been there to help me. I
won't mention any names, for fear
I should forget etc. I will leave it
by saying that there are those who
have helped me have more good
times than bad this year. What more
can you ask for?
I rest my case.
Chris Davidson.
