London's falling to pieces
Since the beginning of this year the future of the University of London has
beenin doubt. Andrew Tseng investigates what could happen next.
If Imperial did disaffiliate from
the University of London then
students would almost certainly lose
out. The vast facilities of the
University of London Union
(ULU), which include its great
multitude of clubs and societies,
would no longer be available.
Neither would the University of
London Library. Accomodation
would also be in jeopardy.
According to the Rector, Imperial,
Hence in November 1992 a body
known as the Charter Review
committee was set up. Sitting
therein were members of Imperial
College's Governing body and the
single student representative, Chris
Davidson, then Imperial College
Students' Union President. Their
remit was to examine all the
problems the Rector had identified
and come up with solutions.
On October 22nd 1992,
Commemoration Day, Sir Eric
Ash, the Rector of Imperial
College, dropped a bombshell on
the academic community of
London. His speech on that warm
autumn afternoon included these
fateful words, 'we have resolved to
embark on a review...to examine
the possibility of a separation from
the University of London'.
This single declaration has led
University College and the London
School of Economics to make
similar statements. The London
School of Economics has gone
further. To The Independent, a
press spokesman for the London
School of Economics said, 'it is not
a question of if, but when'.
There are two imporant issues
which the Rector believes must be
settled, the right to award degrees
and the right to appoint senior
academic staff, T believe that the
Rector of Imperial College should
have the same powers as the Vice
Chancellor of the University of
South Bank' he says. The resolving
of the first issue would allow
Imperial to introduce new courses
quickly, without the intervention of
the University of London, a process
that has caused considerable delay
in the past. The second of these
issues was highlighted recently
when a three month delay, by the

professorship.
along with University College and
the London School of Economics,
must own a share in the
Intercollegiate Halls of Residence,
a fact which has been disputed by
others in the University of London.
These options have been set down
in writing by Professor Stewart
Sutherland, the Vice-Cbancellor of
the University of London. In his
paper entitled, 'The University of
London and the Award of Degrees',
Professor Sutherland outlines the
possible two options B and C
(Option A being to leave everything
as it stands at the moment).
Option B describes, the
possibility of the big eight schools
(Birkbeck College, Goldsmiths
College, Imperial College, Kings
College, London School of
Economics, Queen Mary Westfield
College, Royal Holloway College
(formerly the Royal Holloway and
Bedford New College) and
University College) disaffiliating
from the University of London.
Professor Sutherland discusses what
he believes the consequences of
disaffiliation would be. The
overwhelming advantage for
Imperial College, is that
disaffiliation would solve both the
problems outlined by Sir Eric Ash.
As far as the University of
London is concerned, Professor
Sutherland believes that Option B
has some major disadvantages. One
of which being that the Constitution
of the University of London would
have to be changed. This would
require much time and effort which
could be better used elsewhere.
Professor Sutherland also predicts
that any 'withdrawal would
inevitably be a messy business,
possibly involving bitter and
ennervating argument'.
Fortunately for students and for
the University of London there
could be another solution to
Imperial's problems that would
cause less turmoil. In Option C of
his paper, Professor Sutherland
