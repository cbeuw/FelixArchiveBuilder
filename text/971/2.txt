Student advantage
by D a c l a n Curry
Further education students have
reportedly been given a new edge
over their higher education
counterparts. A new survey
commissioned for the Department
of Employment shows that more
employers are plumping for
applicants with vocational
qualifications over those with a
degree.
The Institute of Manpower
Studies, which carried out the poll,
said there has been a shift towards
the selective recruitment of fewer,
better qualified and older
applicants. Clare Simpkin, an
employment journalist, says that a
combination of recession and
demographic changes has killed off
traditional patterns of mass
recruitment.
Meanwhile, new figures have
been published concurring with
earlier fears that graduate
employment prospects are
plummeting. Graduate vacancies in
chartered accountancy were down
a quarter last year, and experts are
predicting a tougher time this year.
Roger Hammett, of Southampton
University's careers service, says
'every sector has been affected by
falling vacancies'. Neil Harris, of
London University careers service
said they were expecting 100 firms
to attend July's London
Recruitment Fair. This is just half
the number which attended in 1989.
'The financial sector is very dull,'
added Dr Harris.
Engineers exhibiting
by D e c l a n Curry
A major exhibition was hosted by
the Royal Academy of Engineering
on Queen's Lawn yesterday. The
soiree, an annual event which
moves from institution to
institution, was organised this year
by Professor Patrick Dowling,
Head of Civil Engineering, and
Professor Jack Chapman, a visiting
professor.
The soiree will include
exhibitions on the theme of the
contribution of engineering to the
nation's wealth. Professor Dowling
told Felix that this wealth was not
just material, but also included
environmental and other
contributions to the quality of life.
A committee of 'eminent persons'
has selected 35 exhibits to show
how technical innovation moves
from the workbench to the
marketplace.
One of the seven exhibits from
Imperial shows a new artificial knee
joint for use in medicine. The joint,
which replaces non- generating
ligaments at the back of the knee
cap, comprises thousands of
filaments bolted together between
the femur and the tibia. The joint
can take stress up to half a ton.
Other exhibits include a Dundee
invention which detects bank note
forgeries by using spectral analysis,
and a device from Hertfordshire
which detects Legionnaire disease-
causing particles, a task described
as finding six needles in Wembley
stadium.
Professor Dowling says that
engineering is working hand in
hand with industry, but accepts
there are problems with the
marketing of innovations. Speaking
on L B C Newstalk, the Professor
said this was due to boardrooms
being crammed with technical
illiterates, and engineers being 'too
narrowly educated' so that they do
not have finance and
communication skills.
The problematic shortfall in the
numbers of engineering students has
received government attention this
week. Incentive awards of £500
have been announced to tempt high
calibre students to opt for
engineering degrees. The scheme,
administered by the Engineering
Council, will provide funds for two
thousand students, and will run for
three years, starting next
September. In announcing the
scheme, the Education Secretary,
John Patten, urged employers to
alert students to the 'increasingly
competitive starting salaries for
engineering graduates,' which
currently stand at £12,800 per
annum. Denis Filer, director
general of the/Engineering Council,
said the bursaries would attract
'people much needed by the
industry'. The bursaries have also
been welcomed by the Science
Minister, William Waldegrave.
'This reflects the spirit of the
science and engineering white paper
and the importance government
attaches to engineering. It's just
what the profession wanted.'

Boat Club out
by D e c l a n Curry
Eight members of ICU Boat Club
have been banned from a major
rowing event. Stewards at the
Henley Royal Regatta disqualified
the members from taking part in the
IC 'weedy'
by D e c l a n C u r r y
Members of an Imperial department
have been described as 'weedy',
'scruffy', 'unkempt' and
'unattractive'. The verdict on
chemists was delivered by hundreds
of teenagers studying the subject.
The denouncement was made in a
survey for the Royal Society of
Chemistry, which was trying to
attract more youngsters into the
'Temple Challenge Club'. The
competition, for colleges and non-
collegiate universities, was won by
Imperial last year. A new team has
been formed to try and hold the
title.
profession. For good measure, the
13-18 year olds also described
chemists as 'swots', 'wimps',
'loners', and 'male'. Dr Sepp
Gruber, of the Royal Society, said
the results showed that 'the message
is not getting through that chemists
make a major contribution to the
national economy and improving
the environment and social
conditions.'
Rubbish
by D e c l a n Curry
Estates has announced that it is to
take trash seriously, with the
appointment of a new Waste
Control Officer. Bob Birrell,
formerly Technical Services
Manager at Electrical and
Electronic Engineering, will co-
ordinate the introduction of a new
'Waste Disposal Policy'. The policy
will be influenced by the 1990
Environmental Protection Act,
which places a 'duty of care' on
those involved in the disposal of
household, industrial and trade
waste.
In other staff changes, Clare
Daunton has resigned as
Development Officer, to take up a
new job with Shelter. Dr Jill
Pellew, Director of Development,
told Felix that Mrs Daunton 'had
done great work and will be
missed'. Mrs Daunton will be
replaced by Clive Oakley.
