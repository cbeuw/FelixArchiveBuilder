A Slice of Life
Owain Bennallack
The saga of the City Job continues
It was all going to be so easy.
Firstly the formality of the
interview. There, with my natural
wit and charm, I'd make them
laugh, cry and give me a job. Say
another week for my references to
check out (and my chequed bribes
to check in) and then I'd be away,
sky-rocketing towards my first
million.
I considered the timescales.
September seemed a pretty good
month for becoming a millionaire.
Fine enough to drive to
Southampton in my open top
Lambourghini but the roads much
quieter then in August. Once there
I'd turn to face old England, gently
bathed in an Autumnal sunset. Then
I'd casualy raise two fingers up at
the whole miserable affair before
sailing off to the golden Maldive
Islands in a yacht called 'Slut
Pacific'. (Never mind the logo.)
I couldn't help noticing my
reflection - after all I'd walked
halfway across a branch of Miss
Selfriges to get at the mirror. Oh,
I looked the part. I Tube to Cannon
Street, full of hopes and shopping
lists. I wasn't sure exactly how the
set up would work - would those
grades merit two secretaries? Oh
well, with a personal computer
linked up to the global financial
maelstrom I could probably do most
of the work unassisted. At least
before any lunchtime beverages.
The building is huge and made of
glass. Even the floors seem to be
constructed from glass planks. I
hope allowances have been made in
the lavatory areas but then I realise
that there's no room for secrecy
amongst the team members. A l l
outgoings would have to be
accounted for. The reception desk
directs me to room one six one.
At open-doored room one six one
I'm ignored. I cough. I knock the
door again. I jump up and down.
The blue striped man only looks up
when I begin to try to retrieve some
fibrey ryebread from a lower molar.
I blush and bluster, then pull
myself together. I try to start my
speech but he just says 'Job'. I nod
stupidly. 'Go talk to Arthur in the
cloakroom back at reception'.
Cloakroom? He looked back down
at his work. I went to talk to Arthur
in the cloakroom.
Arthur, the bane of my young
capitalism. He explains in his
Yorkshirean accent that I'm to be
brought in to replace him during
summer. In the cloakroom.
Guarding peoples clothing. And
giving it back. Not even any
interest. I stutter. Bbbut, stock
market? ECU's? Loud tables at
restaurants and a symphony of
mobile phones?
He placed a hand on my shoulder.
I trembled because I knew what was
coming. After thirty years putting
waistcoats on racks Arthur and his
mind would have construed all
manner of Freud-flitting, Jung-
juggling dementias to cope with
their tedious predicament.
'Look at it this way son,' he
began. 'Some men find their heart
in music, or in horse-racing. Some
turn their hands to a trade,
becoming bricklayers or carpenters.
And my son Derrick has found it in
his wide-ranging collection of
woolly brown tanktops.' Arthur had
clearly found his heart in
Philosophical pontificating.
Pontificating presently pointed at
me. Would he ever end? A coat, a
coat, my lost millions for a coat to
rack!
'But me, my fate in life has been
outerwear.' Outerwear? Was he
talking about some city in Canada?
I imagined the tourist hook -
'Outaware, with its crystal clear
streams, breathtaking mountain
ranges and a special place in the
heart of every senile suicidal
northern dimwit cloakroom
attendant'. Suicidal? Oh yes...my
hands reached for his neck.
'I can't say it's always been an
easy road mind you,' he said,
dumping an overcoat across my
groping arms. 'But the main thing
is - ITS BLOODY OVER!' He
burst into an insane laugh, his eyes
suddenly seemed like buttons, his
lips a couple of coat-hangers. 'And
now you have to do it, and I don't!'
More laughter. 'You,' stabbing my
chest with his finger and dumping
me another overcoat. 'You, you,
you.' Drowning under overcoats
the room goes hazy. His ears are
locker handles and the room
wallpapered with ticket numbers.
My mind whirled. Would I stay
here forever? Maybe he'd just
stumbled in here himself, a fiery
young D . H Lawrence looking for
a few shillings beer money and
perhaps a couple more for elocution
lessons. But the place had
consumed him, blasting his soul
barren like it'd been sent to the dry
cleaners. Now the curse had passed
to me. But first I'd have to survive
the trial-by-coat, which didn't seem
likely from underneath them all.
Death in Outaware - a tale of greed,
insanity and an animal lust for a
nicely turned seam. Decision time.
I'm outta-here.
Later I calm down. It's not the
end of the world. There's still
plenty of time to find another job.
Maybe in a hospice, an animal
refuge or a childrens home. I still
have my pride (and a newly
acquired prejudice). Hrnmmm, and
I also have a briefcase to sell. Offers
anyone?
I'd just like to thank everyone
who's been mentioned herein at any
time for the genorous bribe they
paid for the privilege. Thanks to
Jonty, for unceasing
encouragement, I'm sorry I didn't
get a chance to mythologise you and
your merry crew. Thanks also to
everyone who's said they've
enjoyed it (Or laughed
conspicuously loudly in the JCR...)
And unescaping Isabel, you're
unsliceable...a whole Patisserie in
fact. Now your face can match your
hair!
Boulez at the Barbican
Patrick Wood squeezes himself into the corner of a page to review Pierre
Boulez's lastest offering
Pierre Boulez has long been known
as the arch-polemicist of 20th
century music. As conductor and
writer he regularly takes up the
cudgels on behalf of those who have
influenced him, particularly
Debussy, Stravinsky and the
Second Viennese School. The fact
that much of the music of
Schoenberg, for example, remains
peripheral and in need of such
advocacy, is more a reflection of the
modern fashion for instant
gratification than anything to do
with the music itself. Schoenberg's
Five Orchestral Pieces, played by
Boulez and the L S O at the
beginning of last Saturday's
concert, are a case in point.
Repeated, careful listening reveals
the work to be a rich and rewarding
tapestry of sound. When every
strand of the ravishing second
movement can be heard, as it can
under Boulez, the music becomes
as involving and coherent as
anything Debussy ever wrote.
In Bartfjk's brash and percussive
First Piano Concerto, soloist Daniel
Barenboim was often compelled to
sacrifice incisive clarity for power
in an attempt to combat a large and
enthusiastic orchestra. Even more
players took the stage for the final
work, Stravinsky's Rite of Spring,
a Boulez speciality. There were ten
double-basses, and the nine French
horns played on several occasions
with bells raised. Again, clarity was
clearly a prime concern, and all the
opening woodwind rustlings were
discernible, as were such
embellishments as panting bass
clarinets and chugging horn ostinati
later on. And there was no lack of
excitement and rattling virtuosity in
passages such as the headlong
conclusion to Part I. But while the
LSO, and the brass section in
particular, have never been reticent
about playing loudly, there was a
disappointing lack of really quiet
playing. The reverential hush at the
kissing of the earth became instead
a healthy mezzo-forte, and the only
real pianissimo came in the sinister
trumpet duet at the start of Part II.
The final Sacrificial Dance built up
no little excitement (magnificent
horns baying like bloodhounds) and
received one of the most
enthusiastic receptions I have heard
in the Barbican Hall for a while.
