Albert's undercover
Declan Curry peeks under the covers to find something rotten in the state
of heritage, and thinks about adopting an angel
In the winter of 1989, a strange
object began to appear in South
Kensington. A large edifice,
resembling a grain silo, manifested
itself, right on the edge of Hyde
Park, spoiling the skyline and
disturbing surrounding nature. This
monstrosity was not left by aliens,
but by a strange creature. The
Baroness Blatch, Emily, to her
friends, stood and watched as the
curious carbuncle took form. The
structure would perform no visible
useful function, but would consume
vast quantities of cash, and become
the area's biggest eyesore. It now
threatens to become the
Government's millennium gift to
South Kensington.
It was not always thus. Until that
winter, a beautiful and picturesque
monument resided on the spot. It
was a monument to science, to
technology, to art and music. It was
dedicated to the power of
knowledge, and the civilising
effects of global cooperation. It is
the Albert Memorial, built for the
princely sum of £137,000, now
incarcerated at an annual cost of
£250,000, completely hidden from
view.
The Albert Memorial was built
on the site of the 1851 Great
Exhibition, as is imperial College.
The Exhibition was Britain's
showcase to the world, proudly
displaying her wealth of culture and
learning. Yet, at this same
Exhibition, the Royal
Commissioners noticed the growing
strength of European scholarship,
and the waning of Britain's
influence in science and technology.
Such influence was of interest to the
Monarchy. Following the 1851
Exhibition, Queen Victoria told
Parliament that 'the advancement of
practical science will be readily
recognised as worthy of attention'.
'Her interest was shared by the
Prince Consort, Albert, who, in
1845, founded the Royal College of
Chemistry, becoming its first
President and personally inviting
the great Hoffmann to London as its
first professor. In 1872, the Royal
College of Chemistry began its
protracted move to South
Kensington, onto land acquired
from those same Royal
Commissioners for the 1851
Exhibition. The final emergence of
specialised science and technology
education did not emerge until
1907, with the formation of
Imperial College, and the award of
its Royal Charter. The 1851
Commissioners still have an office
at Imperial; their representative on
earth currendy resides on the fourth
floor of the Sherfield building.
Albert's interest in science is
displayed in the memorial,
constructed and dedicated to him
after his death of typhoid in 1861.
Two bronze life-size figures stand
on either side of the Prince Consort,
representing science. His interests
in art is displayed in the mosaic
gables above the main statue, and
169 artists, writers, musicians,
sculptors and architects are depicted
in the marble frieze around the base
of the Memorial. The fourteen foot
high statue of Albert has a catalogue
of the Great Exhibition perched on
his knee. London property
specialist, Mira Bar-Hillel, says that
the Memorial 'is a monument to
both Albert and the exhibitioners.
He's more than a pretty face.'
Not that any of this can be seen.
Students from Imperial, concert-
goers from the Royal Albert Hall,
tourists in Hyde Park, Londoners
on the number 9 bus can only
marvel at the Skylab-like
scaffolding now encapsulating the
Memorial. The 165 feet high
structure has itself entered the
Guinness Book of Records, as the
largest piece of free-standing
scaffolding in the world. This
global feat may itself have caused
a small, ironic smile to cross the
Royal lips. After all, it was his wife
who was never amused.
The green, red, blue and white
hulking beast that so dominates
West London was constructed to
allow emergency and essential
repairs to the monument. Hush, did
I hear a hammer blow against lead,
the whistle of skilled craftsmen?
Hardly likely. The scaffold started
to go up in 1989, the Department
of National Heritage decided in
October 1992 to press on with a £10
million repair package, and a month
later the terrible twins duo of
Norman Lamont and Michael
Portillo stopped the money.
Heritage Secretary Peter Brooke
told MPs that he had to postpone the
start of the repair programme
because 'of the many demands on
public resources at a time of very
tight public expenditure control'.
The only work that has been done
is by the various consultants,
Albert, Angus and someone else.
