Climbing to the top of the tower
Who is Sir Ronald Oxburgh ? Declan Curry tries his hands at a profile,
using the old tricks of research, thefts, bribes, and scrounging expensive
lunches from his news editor.
Oxburgh? He's Ministry of
Defence, isn't he? Oh well, nothing
for it but the Whitehall Companion,
the Government watchers' bible.
Let's see, M , N , P, no back a bit,
O, O, Owen John, Owen Peter,
hmmm.... no Ron Oxburgh. Hold
on, O X B U R G H , Professor Sir
ERNEST. Ernest? Is this the same
man? ERNEST R O N A L D . Yep,
must be.
It is a touch bizarre. The in-house
bible, the Who's Who of Whitehall,
where status symbols abound, and
our very own Sir Ron gets a cursory
mention at the bottom of a page, in
a different name, and look, no
photograph, one of the very few
entries without one. Then again, a
man who is the Chief Scientific
Adviser at the MOD, and grade 1A
to boot, probably doesn't need
much in the line of a status figure.
He does seem to be a bit of a
mystery, though. Granted there is
the old proviso that M O D senior
staff have meagre entries (Official
Secrets and all that), but this one
really is bare.
'Career: professor of mineralogy
and petrology, University of
Cambridge 1978-; chief scientific
adviser M O D 1988-;'
What, is he only fifteen years
old? No, he was born on 2
November 1934, so he's sixty next
year. Unemployed? Imprisoned?
Most definitely not Chief
Scientific Advisor, Ministry of
Defence, C S A , M O D . It's like a
mantra. He's probably seen my
MI5 files as well.
No doubt they were checked
anyway when my boss, M r Tseng,
bounced the first request for an
interview off the desk of John
Cryer, Oxburgh's P A at the
Ministry.
'An interview, eh? What for?'
'Well, to talk to him....'
And so on. Request passed to
another, then back, then to a
secretary, then to .Oxburgh, and
that's just to get an agreement in
principle. Life's too short. Let's
hope next year he'll be more
accommodating, otherwise it will
be too much to stomach the usual
Rectorial whinge that we never
check our facts with the people who
know ('but never want to tell' being
the sotto voce response).
Maybe this level of cossetting
comes with the job. Sir Ron appears
in the chart called 'higher
organisation of Defence'.
Theoretically, the ministers are
responsible for the department, with
the civil servants providing a
supporting role. Right. Malcolm
Rifkind is Defence Secretary. He
couldn't run a message. The junior
ministers are Archie Hamilton,
from the East Anglia mafia, busy
keeping John Major's political
prospects alive; Jonathan Aitken,
paying more than usual interest to
the Scott inquiry into Arms for Iraq;
and some viscount or other. That's
that strong ministerial team tied up.
Looking at the powerbrokers, the
chief civil servant is Sir Christopher
France, vaguely remembered as
being a smash hit in the same job
in Health and Social Security. And
then under him is Professor Sir E
R Oxburgh. Well spotted, number
two at the M O D . The line of
command runs from Sir
Christopher France, to Sir Ron
Oxburgh, then to his deputy and
seven other scientists. Now that's
real power, and scientific clout. It's
a long time since the Sherfield Set
have had a strong hands on manager
capable of smacking wrists. No
wonder they're grumbling. M r
Fraser is allegedly not amused, and
as for M r Marshall, he's leaving
anyway, contract unrenewed we are
told. Gordon's got a case of the
Westermans, bad luck.
So what has the boy wonder done
all these years? Building a strong
academic background, it seems,
though there must be something
good about an academic who's had
part of his research funded by the
Hungarian Academy of Sciences. A
native Scouser, born and bred etc,
educated for eleven years from the
age of seven at the Liverpool
Institute, which was always thought
of as a sweeping description of
Merseyside anyway, or was that
institution? To Oxford in 1953,
emerging blinking into the sunlight
four years later with an honours
