autumn
Dear Marge,
I am changing jobs very soon
(Late July) and I think it may be
difficult to find partners in the way
I have this year. One bloke has been
so good I fear life will not be the
same without his 'presence'. What
can I do?
J. c/o Felix
Dear J.
I suggest a trip top the less
dignified areas of Soho. 'Mr
Spoons' always does it for me.
Dear Marge,
I find myself racked with guilt
over a lapse of professionalism
earlier this year. The casting couch
syndrome caught me unawares. It
is some consolation that they did
make good stewards in the long run.
Dick
Dear Dick,
Lack of professionism effects us
all.
Dear Marge,
I find myself attracted to a man
much older than myself. I didn't
think it mattered until I took him
into Da Vinci's one evening. The
rumours that have circulated since
have left me unsure as to which way
to turn.
D the H
Dear D
Yeah, the bar staff can be really
bitchy at times can't they?
Dear Marge,
I am little concerned about my
future. A 'faux pas' committed at
the end of the autumn term has left
my nerves in tatters at the thought
of taking office. Please advise.
Mary
Dear Mary,
Have you found your glasses
yet?
Dear Marge,
I am currently suffering from a
major guilt complex. Towards the
end of the first term I found myself
becoming increasingly infidelities
and the fear that my behaviour has
rubbed of in recent weeks onto oy
colleagus. For example take
Friday
HIV+
Dear HIV+
There is an actual medical
condition called 'Letsbeacom-
pletecunttomygirlfrienitis' that is
highly contagious and affects
most men at some point in their
lives, so there is no need to worry.
Dear Marge,
A very good friend of mine has
always promised me that he would
leave his past girlfriend for me but
has recently gone back to her. I
worry not so much about myself but
a man who will have so much
responsibility in the year ahead
should stick to his word. Is there
anything I can do?
B&B, SW7
Dear B&B,
I always find pinning them to
the table with a fondue set
works...
Dear Marge,
Being such an arrogant
exhibitionist, and thinking that you
would forget to write about me in
the last Felix, I thought I'd write
and tell you what I have been up to
this year:
1. Infidelity
2. Buggery
3. Numerous menages-a-trois
4. More infidelity
5. Paedophilia
6. Partner swapping
7. More infidelity
8. Homosexuality
9. Intimate moments involving
'Haagen Dazs Frozen Peach
Yoghurt'
10. More Infidelity (I like the
infidelity)
Is this normal behaviour for a
man in my position?
Abraham Lincoln
Dear A . L .
I'll see you around ten then?
Dear Marge,
My lecturer and I have been
having sex for the last three months
and in return for performing all his
animalistic requests, he gives me
good grades. Am I a slut?
Marie McBeth
Dear Marie
Yes. If you are achieveing
orgasm, I would stay with him
though. Good, satisfying men are
hard to find these days.
Dear Marge,
I have an obession of looking at
the breasts of female Salvation
Army members. I can't stop
myself. Any cures?
Joe B.
Dear Joe
How about a really good shag
with a buxom lass?
2 November College security order the evacuation of
the College when a 1 5 minute bomb warning is
received. College management cancel the order (it
was raining) and keep everyone inside for half an hour

4 November The Department of Health won't comment
on reports that it hasn't got enough money to
implement the Tomlinson Report. The report into
London health care calls for the closure of five
hospitals; the merger of six; the relocation of the
