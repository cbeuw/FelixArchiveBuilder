Felix 971 23 June 1993
proposes allowing the eight schools
to be repositioned within the
University of London.
In its new capacity, the right to
award a University of London
degree would be delegated to
Imperial. This would keep the
University of London title on the
degree certificate, but give Imperial
the freedom that the Rector wants
over the creation of new courses.
Sir Eric Ash's second issue would
also be satisfied, since Imperial
would have full control over the
appointment of senior staff with the
University of London only
providing a 'rubber stamping role'.
The Vice-Chancellor believes
that the University of London
should choose Option C. Professor
Sutherland can envisage only a
couple of minor disadvantages to
this Option. He can see that some
may criticise this Option, for
increasing the diversity of the
University of London, though he
counters this by arguing that,
'diversity is one of the great
strengths of the University of
London'.
The advantages of this Option are
all too apparant. No major
consitutional changes need occur,
and the problems highlighted by the
Rector are solved without the
custody arguments associated with
Option B.
Option C is only being offered as
a possibility to the big eight schools.
This has been criticised by some,
who have made the accusation that
it will introduce a two-tier system
within the University of London.
Geoffrey Alderman, chairman of
the academic council of the
University said, 'I would rather see
the larger colleges leave the
university altogether than adopt a
two-tier system.' Professor
Sutherland, however, has denied
that Option C will bring about a
two-tier system.
Either Option B or Option C must
be chosen. The Rector has made it
quite clear that the problems of
appointing senior academic staff
and that of awarding degrees must
be resolved, even if leaving the
University of London was the only
means of achieving this. The debate
must now be decided upon at the
court of the University of London,
whether the big colleges will be
allowed to be repositioned or
whether they must disaffiliate to
achieve the powers that they seek.
Should a repositioning occur,
then students can only gain. All the
facilities of the University of
London and U L U will still be open
to them, and without the
bureaucracy, Imperial will be in the
prime position to react to changes
in Europe and the United States.
This is just one of the issues that
are being discussed by the Charter
Review committee. The Rector
wants to have a set of proposals
regarding that and other matters on
the new Rector's desk when he
comes into office at the start of the
next academic year. It looks as if
Imperial College will be able to
have its cake and eat it.

Afterwards, ICU Honorary Secretary Dominic
Wilkinson said 'some Marys' students aren't fit to
lick the shit off our shoes.' Despite Marys' students
shouting sexual and homophobic abuse, two former

Simon Smith try to defend the indefensible, and also
demand the resignation of Mr Wilkinson.
