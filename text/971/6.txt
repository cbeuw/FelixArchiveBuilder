Bitch
Cat's Eyes
T h a n k s
Firstly, and this might be the boring
bit for some people, the thanks that
I feel I owe a few people since I
started here. If you feel that reading

F u c k i n g s
Since I started writing for Felix, I
have taken more than my fair of shit
from people. OK, so I dish it out
as well on occasions, but that's what
I've been here for. I am only a
student with an opinion. Is it my
fault that most of the fucking
college is too apathetic to write
anything for Felix? Many people
have been quick to attack, but have
they got the dedication to write 600
words a week, every week? Only
if you answered 'yes' to the
previous question, can you be
worthy to have had a go at me.
Otherwise, kindly shut the fuck up
in future. Oh, that also applies to
any other aspect of Felix. If you are
not happy with anything, come in
next year, if you are still here, and
as Donny said 'fucking do better.'
The doors are always open.
The following list of persons is
anyone, and I mean anyone, who
has personally giuen me more
hassle than I deserve. They may
contribute to Felix in some way,
that I am not criticising. I am
attacking them directly. Instead of
thanks, I offer them the venomest
'fuck off possible, the biggest V -
sign imaginable, the most nasty
wish of a painful life and then a
painful and slow death.
Catherine Darwen (for making
me feel unwelcome and being bossy
all the time), Ian Davies (for abuse
at the elections and general
comments throughout the year; it
isn't hard to see why he has made
a few enemies over the years),
Andrew Wensley (for being
primeval in body and mind), Dave
Goddard (for being a smarmy git),
Joshua Burrill (for not being able to
crack a joke and hence grate on my
nerves; some people will not just go
away), Dan in IC Radio (the one
who thinks that simply because he
is the RSM, he can treat everyone
like shit).
Are you disappointed? Expecting
a description of what each one has
done followed by real slag off?
Tough. I'm fed up with them all.
They are not worth it.

Felix
Next year brings a new Felix Editor
and hence a new style to Imperial
College's student newspaper. A m
I going to be here? I won't know
until the autumn. It is Beccy's
decision to keep it or not. I won't
pressure her. I would like to remain
involved in Felix, whether or not
Cat's Eyes is continued. To write
whatever you like for any
publication, has been and is great
fun. Total freedom (within a few
limits) is the key. It is an
opportunity that many people sadly
miss.
Credits
I have written more than just my
usual blurb throughout the year.
Oh, yes. I've been in almost every
section at some point this year.
Anything with the pseudonyms
Harry Something or P. Tentious
have been mine. I also wrote
Whiskas The Mouses' manifesto, a
few Lonely Hearts columns, the
odd Valentine, lots of reviews,
something illegal in the special
Features edition and fuck wads of
reviews in the special Reviews
edition. I have edited the reviews
pages since Easter as well. So, you
think Felix has been crap? Would
my presence explain it? Do you
think I care? Then do something
and come in next year and 'fucking
do better'.
P.J. D o d d , in the Felix office,
w r i t i n g C a t ' s E y e s f o r
probably the last time. G o o d
bye all. G i v e the S a b b s a
g o o d grilling for m e every
day of every w e e k of their
t e r m in o f f i c e . T h e y are
f u n d e d to serve y o u and no
one else. Never let t h e m
forget that, a n d never think
that s o m e o n e will d o the
c o m p l a i n i n g f o r y o u .
Everyone has a voice. It's a
s h a m e to think that w e could
all shout extremely loudly,
but instead only a f e w of us
m u m b l e . F u c k i n g s t o
a p a t h e t i c b a s t a r d s . G o l d
stars to contributors of Felix.
H u g s to everyone o n the
Thanks list. T h a n k s again to
J o n t y , for not only giving m e
a p l a c e in Felix, but for
helping m e to discover what
I w a n t to d o with m y life-a
gift that is truly priceless.
