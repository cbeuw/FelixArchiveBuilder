Ten hospitals to go,
St Marys' faces axe
in 'vandalism' fear
by D e c l a n Curry
The official verdict on the
Tomlinson Inquiry will be delivered
later today, when the reports from
six high-level review groups hit
Health Secretary Virginia
Bottomley's desk at eleven o'clock
this morning. Press reports suggest
that nine London hospitals could
shut, and St Mary's Hospital in
Paddington, indirectly part of
Imperial College, is one of another
four hospitals fighting for survival.
The speciality review groups
were set up as part of the
Government's response to the
report from the Tomlinson Inquiry.
The groups examined the provision
of heart, cancer, paediatric,
neuroscience, renal and plastic
surgery services in London. This
morning's report is expected to
slash these key services. Labour has
described the plans as 'sheer
vandalism'.
The hospitals threatened with
closure are Royal Marsden
Hospital, Chelsea; St Thomas'
Hospital, Central London; St
Bartholomew's Hospital; Harefield
Hospital; The London Chest
Hospital; Queen Elizabeth Hospital
for Children, Hackney; Brook
Hospital, Greenwich; Oldchurch
Hospital, Romford; and Atkinson
Morley Hospital. Health pressure
group London Health Emergency
(LHE) says a subsequent financial
crisis will lead to the possible
closure for a tenth hospital, Queen
Mary's Hospital, in Roehampton.
According to L H E , the
rationalisation of the speciality
services will leave four other
hospitals fighting for survival. St
Mary's in Paddington is expected
to lose its esteemed cancer unit and
almost all of its renal services
immediately, with its cardiac
service to be axed within a few
years. Britain's first mobile cardiac
unit was launched by Health
Secretary Virginia Bottomley at St
Mary's during April, and Mrs
Bottomley also said last February
that St Mary's 'was well sited in
relation to the population'. Peter
Richards, Dean of St Mary's
Hospital Medical School, is making
no comment on the reports, but
senior adrrunistrators at the Medical
School say they could 'go under' if
St Mary's Hospital closed or was
downsized. The three others are
King's College Hospital, the Royal
Free, and the Maudsley.
Any change to St Mary's Medical
School would demolish plans for an
expansion of the Imperial College
School of Medicine, and wreck the
Health Secretary's own proposals
for a new 'Chelsea Health Sciences
Centre'. The four other components
of both plans are now facing
possible closure or ravaging of
existing services. The Royal
Marsden is reportedly facing
immediate closure (Felix 966), and
the Royal Brompton may merge
with the new Westminster and
Chelsea Hospital, flatly
The new Leopold Muller Cystic Fibrosis Gene Research Laboratory w

contradicting Mrs Bottomley's
encouragement to both hospitals to
submit a joint trust application. As
reported in Felix 970, the
Hammersmith Hospital is expected
to lose its cardiac service, along
with its paediatric, neuroscience
and cancer services. Celia Oakley,
a cardiac professor at the Royal
Postgraduate Medical School, has
already predicted that the
Hammersmith Medical School
would shut if the cardiac service
were to close. Charing Cross
Hospital is due to lose its renal,
paediatric, and cancer services. Its
plastic surgery service would stay
at the site only if their specialist
Accident and Emergency services
remains there also. Health experts
have warned that Charing Cross
A & E will shut if any of the
specialist services are lost from
Charing Cross.
