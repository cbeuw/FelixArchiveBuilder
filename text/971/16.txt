The ICSMCC, known to most of us
as the IC Bike Club, organised an
inter-university competition in
conjunction with P U M A
(Polytechnic and University
Motorcycle Association) on Sunday
the 13th June in the heart of Surrey.
It started at Guildford University
and involved teams riding skillfully
and quickly around some of the
finest and most educational roads in
the hilly rural area near Guildford
and getting to several places in this
area in as short a time as possible.
Points were collected for each place
that the university teams reached on
the way to Box Hill.
Out of the three Universities
taking part, on the bike clubs level,
Guildford came first, Bradford
second and I C , to our
embrarrassment, last. On the
individual level, Imperial's Jim
Edward's despatching and green-
laning skills (on a GT550!) came in
handy leading to a first place and
a trophy in that category together
with brave (foolhardy?) pillion
Richard Murray. An honourable
mention also goes to Hubert
Hinsley (IC club secretary) and
Martin Hardaker, who stunned
everyone with their surprisingly fast
times.
The day was enjoyed by all the
participants and hopefully the club
will organise a similar PUMA event
next year. And manage to do better.
Results:
Guildford Uni 489
Bradford Uni 486
Imperial College 472
Best individual performance:
Jim Edwards (Imperial) 516
IC AFC Year Round up
The first team captained by T
Botzios will be remembered as the
team who could have done a clean
sweep of all the trophies but, in the
end came up with a handful of dust.
They started very strongly in the
first half of the season with S
Watson masochistic Monday night
training proving to be very
effective. Finding themselves
leading the Premier division, easily
through to the semi finals of the U L
challenge cup and also through to
the second round of the U A U . But
complacency and bad team spirit
were to prove insurmountable
obstacles. The firsts found
themselves out of both cups and
trailing in second place in the
League, at the end of the season.
Overall though, a very sucessful
season, with the extra pleasure in
seeing our first team having a better
team season that the rugby team this
year, after years of lurking behind
them.
IC 2nd XI
The second team captained by I
Finnerty got off to its traditionally
bad start, getting eliminated from
the U A U and U L upper reserves
cup in the 1st round. But the
addition of D Phillips later on in the
season at the centre of defence
alongside I Finnerty (Also known
as as the Carl Lewis and Ben
Johnson tandem) helped tighten up
the defence and started the 2nds on
their climb to the top of the First
division. This extraordinary
comeback did not yield the division
title, due to injuries and misfortune
at the closing stages of the
tournament. It did give them the
tide of Champion Reserves, the title
given to the best reserve team in the
U L league.
IC 3rd XI
The third team was captained by
the controversial B. Willis whose
captaincy was, even by Graham
Taylor's standards, poor. Despite
his outstanding football abilities Ben
managed to transform a team of
eleven eager players to eleven
disillusioned wrecks. Often playing
with ten men, the 3rds were kicked
out of the two cups early on in the
season and plummetted to the
bottom of the third division. Words
of rebuke from Ben's charismatic
players, Piyush and N . Strevens put
him on the rigt track. With the help
of a few illegal players, he managed
a series of impressive results which
helped the thirds to avoid
relegation.
IC 4th XI
The forths captained by R. Snell
had a huge task in front of them; to
repeat last year's performance and
become divisional champions. This
they started to do with no problems
whatsoever. With their almost
exclusively foreign team and
continental style of play, they
managed to extend the 4ths
unbeaten run to 30 games and
earned themselves a place in the U L
Upper Reserves cup, a cup usually
dominated by 2nd teams. Near the
end of the season the team became
too cocky, underestimating their
opponents, resulting in a pair of
defeats and elimination from the
cup semi-final helped by D. Bucles
'Divine' hand. Angry words from
R. Snell and D. Buckles, reminders
of humility, helped them regain
their form and cling on to become
divisional champions for the second
year running.
IC 5th XI
The fifth team captained by D.
McClure were by far the most
disappointing team of the cup this
year. Dave's generosity and
kindheartedness in giving up his
best players to higher teams resulted
in a second consecutive relegation
in two years for the 5th team,
despite P. Dahill's heroic efforts to
play in two different teams at the
same time. The highlight of their
season came in the last game of the
season with a 12-0 win over their
arch rivals RSM seconds.
IC 6th XI
The sixth team captained jointly
by J. Archer and A. Karell were the
A C Milan of IC. The two captains
managed to maintain a squad of
about thirty players continuously
reshuffling the side so as not to
disappoint anyone. With such a
formidable squad they managed, to
achieve their primary objective
which was to avoid relegation and
earn themselves a respectable mid-
table position.
