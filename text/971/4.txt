Enough is enough
Dear Felix,
We, the residents of Holbein house,
have decided that enough is enough.
The time has come for us to
proclaim in public the incompetent
and negligent way in which we are
being treated.
Holbein was reopened in January
of this year completely remodelled.
The furnishings in the kitchens are
second to none, and it seems no
expense was spared. That is until
you live there and realise what poor
management and planning can do.
First, there are a disproportionate
number of freezers to refrigerators.
In our kitchen alone we have three
empty freezers to two over-packed
refrigerators for six people. This is
useless. Our refrigerators have to
be taken to put in House 63 because
someone ordered too many
freezers. There is also only one
oven per 24 people, which greatly
reduces the use of frozen food.
Second: kettles and toasters were
stolen earlier in the year (because
the front door wouldn't lock) and
it took over three months to get
them replaced. Third and most
important: There are no locks for
our refrigerators, freezers, or
cupboards even though the holes
have already been drilled. Our
subwardens have been phoning M r
G Daniels, residence area manager,
since January and have been
consistently told that the situation
would be dealt with soon. Then they
were told that no locks of the
correct size were available, but the
more recently finished House 62
basement kitchen and all of House
63 did get locks. But the catch is
that there is only one key per
refrigerator and 2-3 people to use
it. Effectively they can't lock
anything either.
This has led to the inevitable.
Food has been stolen from every
kitchen, and consistently from our
kitchen. If locks were in place we
would be able to tell who the thief
is, and that would probably prevent
the crime in the first place. As it
stands, we would like to be
compensated, as with any loss of
property in Halls. Thefts which
have been reported to the
subwarden would be considered
valid for recompense. Of course
this couldn't come from the
insurance company - they'd never
pay since it's the management's
negligence Which has caused the
situation. Maybe the money could
come from the amenities fees we've
been paying for a television room
and newspapers which have never
materialised!
sincerely,

Play the opinion game!
Dear Jonty,
Of late I have discovered a new
game. It's called 'What are your
views on the reform of the union
structure?'. Hardly a snappy name,
but it seems to describe the game
quite well. This is what you do:
1. Strike up a conversation with
someone in the Union Building. It
helps if you know them, but this is
not necessary.
2. Introduce the topic of union
reform with something approaching
the subtlety of a sledgehammer.
3. Listen to the flow of polarised,
generally uninformed views that
returns.
4. Make agreeing noises
Unfortunately I'm starting'to get
bored with the pretty universal
responses; that it's not very good,
that this has been sprung on us at
such short notice. I agree, but I get
the feeling that these people are
going to vote against the reforms
solely that they were not consulted
earlier.
Yes, it would have been nice to
have been involved as a voting
member of ICU, but we weren't
and that is now in the past.
Anybody that has seen the
constitution as it stands will agree
that it needs a rewrite. So give a
little time; go to the A G M on Friday
(lpm JCR) and go through the
constitution point by point.
It's the document that's
important, not the people and the
politics that surround it. The
constitution will be around for about
a decade; the people are just passing
through.
Yours,
Stef Smith, Physics III
Many thanks to all those who
have contributed to the Opinion
pages this year. It has given me
the greatest of pleasure to read all
your insults, incoherence and
rage. May the fury continue
unabaited until there are no more
Felicies.
Particular recognition must go
to James Crisp for drawing the
cartoons that have enlivened the
pages. I hope Gary Larsen
doesn't sue.
While I am in the process of
thanks let me mention Stef Smith,
think tank scuba diver
extraordinaire, may his credits be
as long as his reputation. Final
thank you, and this really is the
last one luvvies, to Ian and
Yvonne for keeping me fed this
year. Although this once waifish
editor has become rather plumper
because of it!
Ents revenge
Dear Jonty
Just a quick reflective note on the
past year in Ents. This year has seen
a booming Ents programme, with
an extremely varied set of events
and most of these events being sold
out or very close to sold out. With
such success one would be forgiven
in thinking that we have had great
support from Union Staff and
Sabbaticals. Wrong!
During this year, Ents have been
drawn into pointless games of petty
politics by members of the Union.
At every juncture we have been
opposed and we had to fight very
hard to prevent ourselves being
dragged under by swollen egos.
Some of the sabbaticals and
member(s) of staff have been under
the impression that, with their
(very) limited and in some cases
non-existent skills in event
organisation, they should dictate
terms and conditions under which
events are to be run. I seems that
the many year's experience of the
Ents committee count for nothing in
event management. Those who
know nothing, should leave the
decisions to be made by people with
the relevant experience; ie the Ents
Committee.
At this stage I would like to make
clear that we are very appreciative
of the students and staff who have
provided continual support. We
leave this year, proud of the
achievements and successes of Ents,
but jaded by the experience of
working within Imperial College
Union. Unfair, untrue and unkind
accusations have been levelled at
the ents committee by members of
staff this year. We are upset that no
apologies have been made and the
whole experience has left a sour
taste in our mouths.
On a lighter note, we would like
to thank everyone in the Ents
Committee for giving up so much
time to ensure you the punters have
the cheapest top-quality student
entertainment in London. You owe
them a lot. Thanks go to Michelle,
Cathy, Zona, Louise, Felix,
DramSoc (particularly the truly
amazing Andrew Nu), Ian,
Yvonne, Andy F. and Dom.
