therweight division.

This Years Judo
Even thoueh our team has
been somewhat depleted this year
we have still had reasonable suc-
cess, particularly in our fixtures
against other London colleges. In
fixtures With other Universities,
especially Cambridge against
whom we crashed to a resound-
ing defeat, our team has been
strongly outgraded. Even so
several of the club's lower grades
have put up a good fight against
technically superior opponents.
IC held third place in the
Saturday league against teams
from colleges throughout the
London area and would possibly
have held a higher position had
not the team been dogged by in-
juries in its recent final appear-
ance.
In the U L U championships
held at Malet St., IC were second
in the same pool as the eventual
winners — a very strong team
from UC.
IC stand a good chance of
winning the U L U loose league,
provided we can turn out strong
teams for our remaining two
matches against St. Mary's and
King's.
2nd XI Win the Cup
On Saturday, 9th March, IC
2nd XI won their knock-out
challenge cup competition bea;-
ing QMC 2nd XI at Motspur
Park.
1C were favourites to win. but
it turned out to be a little harder
than they had expected. The
pitch was uneven and iron hard
which made controlling the ball
very difficult. This seemed to
rob the game of skill and it be-
came a contest of strength and
determination.
The first twenty minutes were
rather slow, tough tackling from
both defences cutting out the
possibility of any dangerous
attacks. But then a slip by the
IC defence, mainly due to tricky
conditions, left QMC's centre for-
ward on his own with only the
goalkeeper to beat which he did
competently. 1-0 to QMC but a
minute later it was 1-1 ; almost
straight from the kick-off IC
centre-forward Tony Richards
completely beat the QMC goal-
keeper with a beautiful 25-yard
volley. For the rest of the first
half IC seemed to take control
of the game and got a second
goal almost as a matter of course
after 35 minutes. Right half
Brian Hall floated across a glor-
ious centre to the far post where
Hopwood's head was waiting to
put IC in the lead.
The second half however saw
a different story ; IC seemed to
become over-confident and QMC
were on attack almost constantly
for about 30 minutes. The IC
defence fought back, Wojtowicz
the goalkeeper making two good
saves. With about 10 minutes to
go, however, IC's luck ran out
and QMC equalised. This seemed
to bring IC to their senses and
the final 10 minutes turned out
to be a nerve-wracking fight to
the death. Both teams came
close to scoring on a number of
occasions and with only 3 or 4
minutes left IC got a decisive
free kick just outside the QMC
penalty area. The ball was
floated across into the QMC
goal-mouth and headed over the
goalkeeper's head towards the
goal-line. Breathing stopped as
about six players ran to meet the
slowly dropping ball whose desti-
nation was obviously hotly dis-
puted but Denis Harlock was
there first to put it into QMC's
net and the cup was I.C.'s.

On Saturday, 9th March, the week following their outstanding
victory in the UL hockey cup final, ICWA returned to Motspur Park
to take place in the U L one-day tournament. Drawn in the four
team league they easily came top by beating Royal Holloway 1-0,
Kings 1-0, and Bedford College 3-0.
Having earned their place in the final, they had to wait to see
who would win the five team league. As it turned out UC were con-
vincing winners making the final a replay of the preceeding Saturday's
match.
IC heartened by the vociferous
support of the victorious IC foot-
ball 2nds were on the attack for
most of the first half, and after a
lot of pressure on the UC goal,
the left wing, Joyce Butcher,
pushed the ball into the corner of
the net. At half time the score
was 1-0, but shortly afterwards
UC equalized after a defensive
mix-up.
IC was a little disheartened by
this but cheered up immensely
when U C deflected a cross-ball
into their own net. The game was
clinched when the left inner,
Margaret Lumley, made a long
solo run beating all defenders and
slammed the ball into the back of
the net. IC had beaten UC again
and won the tournament.
This season has been the best
that ICWA has ever known. They
have won both the mixed and
women's one day tournaments
and also the U L knock-out cup.
Success is due both to the skill of
the players and to the exceptional
team spirit. Many thanks to all
their supporters, umpires, and
coaches.
The team was : —
S. Long, G. Nelder, J. Mans-
field, L. Campion, L. Martin, V .
Gross, D. Atkinson, J. Pugh, M .
Paluch, M. Lumley, J. Butcher.
Cross
Country
I.C. finished second in the Os-
terly Park relay only 15 5secs
behind the Borough Road team.
The Borough Road team took
the lead from the start and were
well ahead after the first lap with
I.C. in 6th position. Then Nick
Barton pulled I.C. up to second
place and the gap began to close?
Barry Jones then pulled up to
within 100 yards and handed
over to Norman Morrisson who
just failed to catch Borouah
Road even though he broke the
course record by eight-seconds.
Good Season
This was IC's last race of a
very successful season in which
they won the University Cham-
pionship and were second in the
London College League. Finally
we should all like to congratulate
Norman on being selected to run
for Scotland in the International
being held at Tunis this weekend.
