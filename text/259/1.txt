The Imperial College contingent at Sunday's anti-Vietnam war
demonstration were amongst those charged by mounted police
About twenty-five students from I.C. attended the rally in Trafal-
gar Sq., which heard severalfightingspeeches, some of which were
certainly aimed at whipping up the 15,000 crowd's anger. Outside
the US Embassy the police stood three deep and struggled to contain
the demonstration. When the police horses advanced on the crowd,
IC students were almost trampled underfoot. They say, " Police were
sadistically kicking people who had been knocked over," presumably
because they had ignored police orders. After the activities outside
the Embassy the crowd was supposed to go to that symbol of Ameri-
can imperialism, the Hilton Hotel, but for the most part the militants,
were either in police buses or in hospital.
WESTMINSTER
LOBBY FAILS
Last Wednesday about twenty LC. students attended a " mass "
lobby oJ M.P.S about students grants. It was afinedemonstration of
studiitt "apathy" as oniy about 500 students, teemed to consider it
worth while to draw attention to their sorry financial state. Perhaps
they could not afford the fare to Westminster.
Stewards appointed by N.U.S. marshalled people into their con-
stituencies telling them that when there were six people to see one
M.P. they would be let in. Six I.C. students quickly formed them-
selves into a group to see Mr. John Smith, M.P. for City of London
and Westminster in whose constituency I.C. lies. On entering the
lobby they filled in a little green card requesting to see Mr. Smith and
began waiting. For an hour and a half they waited only to hear that
he was not to be found. By this time more I.C. students h;.d gained
entrance to the lobby and filled in their green cards. Unfortunately
none of the ten M.P.'s I.C. students requested to see could be found.
Other student groups
were
more successful and about 20 or
30 M.P.'s came out to see their
constituents. Most students
seemed quite satisfied with the in-
terviews they had, but this was
hardly surprising as the majority
of " available " M.P.'s seemed to
be members of the Opposition.
Notable among " absent " M.P.'s
was Patrick Gordon Walker, the
Education Minister, who had
been seen entering the House
during the afternoon. The ina-
bility of the messengers to find
him can only be interpreted as a
measure of his cowardice and not
of the length of the corridors in
the Houses of Parliament. No
leading government minister
seemed available which was sur-
prising as there was a division
while the lobby was going on.
Once agan diplomacy seems to
have triumphed over democracy.
The I.C. turnout can only be
described as disappointing. Three
members of the External Affairs
Committee appeared and only one
actually got into the lobby. No
members of the Executive were
there and only two members of
Council, who were there because
they are External Affairs Com-
mittee members too, deemed it
necessary to try to see their
M.P.'s. Perhaps they represent
the Union in other ways but i
seem to have ignored one of
most effective ways of making
students' wishes known.

DOWSTAYAWAY
The proposed recruitment visit
to Chem Eng by Dow Chemicals,
who make napalm in the U.S.,
has been cancelled following
rumours that IC Peace Action
Committee was organising a
demonstration to coincide with
the visit which would have been
on Monday.
Last week. Bob Mackman,
President of RCS, heard of the
planned demonstration and noti-
fied President Phillips. He then
went to see the Rector, who de-
cided that the publicity could be
detrimental to IC. At the Rec-
tor's request Professor Ubbelohde,
head of Chem. Eng. department,
got in touch with Dow who
agreed to cancel the visit and ar-
range the interviews elsewhere.
A petition to the Rector asking
that firms who " misuse science
in Vietnam " should be prevented
from recruiting in the College is
being circulated by the Peace
Action Group.
NO FAME
UNION MEETING
DEPLETED BY GUILDS
Despite the vast volume of
publicity heralding Georgie
Fame's appearance at the May
Ball, Ents now announce that he
will not, after all, appear. There
was a clause in his contract allow-
ing him to withdraw up to six
weeks before his projected ap-
peannce. Recently he was
offered a film contract and is tak-
ing advantage of this clause.
Ents now are trying to engage the
Scaffold and Dave Mason, late of
Traffic, to replace Fame, and
with any money over they may
try for Madeleine Ball.
NEXT FELIX
The next issue of FELIX will
be a duplicated one on the first
Wednesday of term, 24th April.
All contributions, What's On,
Small Ads., etc., must be received
by 7 p.m. on Monday, 22nd
April.
NEW DEAN
The new Dean of the Royal
School of Mines will be Profes-
sor M . G. Fleming of the Mining
Department. He was elected to
succeed Professor J. Sutton of
Geology, and will assume office
for a period of three years start-
ing next session.
Thursday's Union Meeting, as was generally expected, took place
in its by now accustomed state of inquoracy and was eventually
adjourned by President Phillips until the early part of next term.
However, had it not been for the annual event of the Guilds Field
Cup, which was taking place at the same time, the numbers present
might just have been boosted from 250 to the 300 required for a
quorum. One cannot accuse Guilds 'of directly sabotaging ICU
meetings, but this is the second time this year that a Guilds happening
has coincided with a Union Meeting (the previous time being a Guilds
carnival collection at the Varsity match). So with the quorum failing
yet again, it now seems that Derek Boothman's mammoth constitu-
tional amendment, the major item for discussion, will be lost for
eternity without even being debated.
Despite the attendance, several'
items of mild interest occurred
including the unopposed election
of Rob Collinge, author of the
Collinge Reports on Student Fi-
nance and Student Houses, to fill
the vacancy on Council caused by
the resignation of Malcolm
Duckett several weeks ago.
A letter had been received
from the Rector outlining the
structure of the Appeals Board
for hall residents convicted of
disciplinary offences. This is to
be the Senior Warden, the stu-
dent Halls Rep. on Council, and
a Warden not involved in the
dispute, with the final right of
appeal being to the Rector. Ap-
peals must be within 48 hours.
On Frank Fuchs' insistence, Ray
Phillips promised to get confirm-
ation of the right of students to
take witnesses before the Board.
Deputy President Martin Lack
gave details of new furniture for
the Upper Lounge, new curtains
Rob Collinge ; elected unopposed
for the Concert Hall, new bar
carpet for Southside, etc., fol-
lowed by Malcolm Duckett's
suggestion of a new executive for
ICU and Les Ebdon's era~k
" Why not re-cover the old one?"
Much laughter at this and at Ray
Phillips' inevitable riposte.
The Left Wing of the Union
then swung into action with com-
plaint from Les Ebdon, Chair-
man of the Socialist Society,
about some publicity for the
Union meeting which seemed to
imply that ICU dissociated itself
from rallies and similar action on
student affairs. Phillips dealt
with this rather ineffectively and
Ebdon went on to inquire about
IC's policy on grants. In reply
to this, pert not-yet-blonde-again
Babs Hedge, of the External
Affairs Committee, said that as
there had not been a quorate
Union meeting recently she had
been unable to get a definite
policy statement on the line to
take. Not exactly a solid excuse
but she added that, up to now,
they had been publicising and
supporting NUS activities.
Finally, Derek Boothman,
Chairman of the Communist
Society, asked what had hap-
pened about the'proposed visit of
Dow Chemicals, who are thought
to make napalm for use in Viet-
nam, to the college. The Presi-
dent stated (as reported elsewhere
in Felix) that he had consulted
the Rector and because of the
risk of adverse publicity if the
visit went ahead, it had been
cancelled. At this news Mr.
Bland proposed that the Rector
be congratulated on his decisoon,
but this was lost in the ensuing
political squabble as Bill Doris
immediately challenged the
quorum before a vote could be
taken. Surely the most petty way
a quorum has ever been chal-
lenged.
And so we wait until next term
for the constitutional amend-
ments to be debatedâ€”if they
ever are.
