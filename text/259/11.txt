In, out, in, oat, in . . . tnlnlaa can be aulte tiring.
The ICBC, although little publicised, compared with many IC
clubs, can certainly claim to be one of the most successful. A record
of several victories at Henley against college and club crews, many
University of London wins and the fact that we have never lost posses
sion of the University Trial Head Trophy in the seven years of its
existence confirms this.
Perhaps a brief summary of the state of rowing at the present
time would be in order. Competition is broadly divided into races of
novice, junior, junior-senior and senior status and oarsmen can win
a number of events at each level. Clubs attempt to maintain crews
of each status since the transition from novice to senior may only take
a few years.
There are two main ways of running a race. One is the " head
race " type in which teams are timed over a certain distance and the
fastest time wins. The " knock-out" races of an open regatta are
where two or more teams race side by side on a knock-out basis.
The standard of crews varies from clubs producing crews of
international standing, for example Tideway Scullers, to the crews
from schools, colleges and clubs which make up the bulk of the row-
ing in the country. On the whole, club rowing is of a higher standard
than that of school or college although there are exceptions, of which
IC is certainly one, up to the standards of most clubs.
Novice
Training. ..
To maintain the standards from
year to year, a club has to look to
its novices for providing material
for the senior teams of later years.
Many oarsmen come to us with
experience gained at their schools,
many novices start with no know-
ledge of rowing but this does not
matter. Fourteen members of
the three experienced crews at IC
have been trained only since they
arrived here. An IC ex-novice,
now in his third year, rows for
the U L U first eight. #
Training begins soon after
Freshers' Day with the twenty-
odd novices being taken on the
" tank" where they are shown
the rowing technique by the
coach, the " tank," a rowing
simulator, is arranged so that
eight oars-men can sit and row in
a fixed frame, with water circu-
lating past at the same rate as if
they were on the river. They
soon find out how to avoid
" catching crabs " and flailing air.
They are then put in crews and
row for one mile or so along the
river. The distance is slowly in-
creased to 3, 4, 5 miles until, by
the second term, ten to eleven
miles has been reached and the
boat is then moving quite fast.
Novice racing starts in the sum-
mer and the eventual victory in a
novice race at an open regatta
promotes you from novice tc
junior status, a step accompanied
bv a ducking in the river.
Sadly, novices quite often give
up and we have this year reached
an all-time low of twelve who
have remained faithful since sign-
ing up on Freshers' Day. How-
ever, it is never too late to join
and novices who come late are
always found a team place.
. . . . and
Senior Training
For seniors, training begins im-
mediately at the beginning of the
year. Much important work is
done in the gym (although less
here than at other clubs, unfortu-
nately). Here, strength training is
inflicted on all experienced oars-
men and some novices. It in-
volves lifting very heavy weights
a few times (3 in our method)
and the size of the weight is in-
creased until the lift is just
achieved Sometimes, fitness-
circuits are employed but usually
overall fitness comes with quite
a heavy programme of rowing
practice on a Mortlake to Putney
course (4£ miles). Sometimes the
crews are raced against each
other on a handicap basis for the
benefit of slower, crews.
. brings
success
There is no substitute for this
(raining as is shown by the success
of all our teams in this year's
Winter Eights. After beating
QMC in the first round, our
first eight met UC, who had a
blue and a purple and several
U L U trialists in their crew. After
rowing dead level for a while, IC
eventually pulled away to win by
2 lengths. These were our main
opponents and we eventually won
the final.
Our juniors and novices were also
successful in winning all their
races, the novices winning their
final by almost 1 minute!
Other victories include winning
the Southern Universities Cham-
pionships and the win of our first
eight in the U L U Head of the
River race.
Small Boats
Small boats are extremely good
for showing Hp faults in tech-
niques since, if things go wrong
in a sculling boat, there is no-one
to. Blame but yourself! As you
improve, you get a feel of how
what you do affects the boat and
this eventually leads to a greatly
improved technique in the eights.
Y.H.A. Round the Horn
Not quite—but it was certainly
a weekend to remember! Two
minibus loads of men and women
from IC and Bedford stayed in a
Norfolk barn over the weekend
and managed ?o fit in some ex-
cellent sailing, between memor-
able stomach-turning meals pro-
vided by their tame chef.
Weather on the first day was
sunny with a moderate breeze,
the second day turned to gusty
winds sufficient to get some ex-
citement out of the 22ft. half-
deckers. Most boats made (as
last year) an epic voyage across
the gusty two square miles io£
water known as Hickling Broad,
but on its return one boat man-
aged to overturn in the strong fol-
lowing wind whilst performing a
tricky maneouvre (called " hitting
a mooring post"). The occupants
found that the water was wet and
cold; but they're all panting in
anticipation of the whole week's
sailing which will take place over
Easter.
If you're interested in joining
the Easter party, contact any
Y.H.A. Group member. Begin-
ners will find that Mike Lovett's
lucid "Notes on Sailing" will
quickly brush away the. obscuri-
ties!

We experimented in previous
years with this idea as a method
of improvement but it took so
long to teach people how to scull
that little hard work was put in
and fitness suffered. Furthermore,
crew-members forgot how to row
in an eight and the rowing suf-
fered. Still, the experience gained
in sculling, pair and four-man
racing put us in good stead for we
gained several wins in summer
sculling events.
Burn- up
An interesting side line to
training is the all-comers burn-up
from Mortlake to Putney. Every-
thing that could vaguely be said
to be floating was paddled up to
Mortlake by ICBC members and
any other interested parties.
Then, starting with the slowest,
they all headed back to Putney.
Come Hammersmith, they all got
together and havoc was wrought
on the placid waters of the
Thames, the confusion continuing
until the assembled hordes arrived
at Putney.
Prospects
This summer our crews stand
a good chance of several wins.
May I especially mention our 3rd
eight here. They are a crew who
make up for what they lack in
experience with sheer" hard work.
Will we ever win at Henley
again? For next year's exciting
episode why not come along and
join up and you could possibly
have a part in carrying off one of
the year's most treasured rowing
trophies—legally.

HOME
ON THE
RANGE
Despite a general improvement
on last season's scores the Rifle
Club failed to retain the Engine-
ers' Cup for the UL team cham-
pionship. In one of the most
open competitions for many years
UC just managed to scrape home,
to win for the sixth time in seven
years. By way of compensation
the B team easily won division
two, for the third time in foui
years, by winning every match,
the first time this has been done.
In the University individual
knock-out competition, Julian
Tuck narrowly lost in the semi-
final, while Martin Brebner has
reached the final.
Both the Pistol, and Standing
and Kneeling sections have grown
and fielded an extra team, hut
have been unable to break ue
dominance enjoyed by UC which
results from being able to shoot
everyday. This unfortunate itate
of affairs should, however, be
changed when the sports centre
opens, whenever that may be!
