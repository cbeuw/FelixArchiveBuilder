Sit-in at
Manchester
Nearly 100 Manchester Uni-
versity students staged a 2^-hour
sit-in in a corridor near the Vice-
Chancellors' office last Wednes-
day. They were protesting
against the suspension of two stu-
dents who took part in the
demonstration against Patrick
Walker, Secretary for Education,
when he went to speak at Man-
chester on Technical Colleges,
and was shouted down by about
85 students demanding he speak
about grants.
The two students have defied
the suspensions and about fifty
others handed in " confessions "
that they were also involved in
the demonstration. After this
the sit-in broke up. The "con-
fessions " will be considered by
the University Senate, who may
take disciplinary action.

The Incredible Arthur Brown in action
ARTHUR BRD
ETS CARNIVAL
L ^ON FIRE %))
After what must have been the longest and best publicity cam-
paign ever mounted in I.C., I expected that Guilds-Mines carnival
would be a bit of an anti-climax. That it was not is a great credit to
the Guilds and Mines Ente. Committess under the chairmanship of
Dave Matthew and Stan Greetham respectively.
Comparison with this year's very successful R.C.S. Carnival
" Kaleidoscope " is inevitable and, certainly as far as this writer is
concerned " Gypsy Circle " proved to be even better in almost all
respects, as it should have been, at £2 for a double ticket.
£300 spent on groups alone
HALEY AT HOP
Ents are still trying to produce
a series of fantastic hops at the
beginning of next term. For the
hop on May 11th the main attrac-
tion will be Traffic, now a three-
piece group. Carnival will get all
the profits which should be quite
substantial as Traffic's manager,
Muff Winwood is helping to ob-
tain the supporting groups.
Another stupendous hop is
planned when the main group will
be Ten Years After or Bill Haley
and the Comets (no imitation, the
one and only actual one) in the
full spirit of the Rock 'n' Roll
revival.

goes
Dutch
Hoping to emulate the success
of their tour to Denmark in 1966,
the Dramatic Society is going
over to the Netherlands for a
fortnight next September.
The tour is being made pos-
sible by the help of the Nether-
lands-England Society, or in the
vernacular, die Genootschap
Nederland approximately.
Women Needed
The play is to be " Roots " by
Arnold Wesker and is to be pro-
duced by the illustrious Colin
Harrison (he never stops). So
far over twenty members have
shown interest but, believe it or
not, more women would be ap-
preciated. The tour is from Sep-
tember 7-21 st, and it is hoped
that the aforementioned Nether-
lands-England Society will be
able to put them up in members'
homes.
MISTER C.
brought Blossom Toes, Mabel
Greer's Toyshop, Uther Pen-
dragon, Plastic Dreamboat, and
of course the Incredible Crazy
World of Arthur Brown, all good,
and of better quality than the ma-
jority of groups seen at IC.
Arthur Brown's act, although
somewhat stereotyped has a cer-
tain novelty which brightened the
occasion just as feet were begin-
ning to tire and eyes droop. By
way of contrast, the steel band
which performed twice during the
evening was a pleasant change
from the vociferous outpourings
of the other groups. Their music
was good to listen to and better
to dance to. The expense of the
various groups thus seems fully
justified. This is obviously the
way to seal the success of a carni-
val.
Mooney Hotpot
However the work of I.C.
members was also of a high stan-
dard the decorations in the
Lower Lounge and Concert Hall,
whilst simple were bright, cheer-
ful and set the mood effectively.
The choice of Hotpot for the
meal was a creditable one—not
only does it keep warm for some
time without drying up—also
there is little that Mooney can do
wrong with it.
Film Disappointing
The film "Only Two Can Play
was something of a disappoint-
ment; many members of the cx>f:
lege have seen it once (or twice)
before. Coupled with this some-
thing a little livelier is called for
so early (late) in the morning.
Apart from this the whole event
was well organised from first to
last. Even during the evening
there was always someone sober
and reliable and as a result every-
thing ran smoothly—close fol-
lowing the large glowing timetable
displayed on the notice hoard.
Fiery Entrance
Looking back over the evening
Arthur Brown's act stands out
as a good one thoughtfully pro-
duced and so suitable for the oc-
casion. From his entry—de-
scending head-dress on fire to the
stage to his cowering noisy exit
he held the attention of the
crowds. Heckling which so often
spoils performances at this college
was duly crushed and soon disap-
peared altogether.
The best comment to finish this
article appears on a poster in
Mines—" Last week was Guilds-
Mines Carnival."
MARTIN MOYES
DRAMSOC ONE ACT
PLAYS A SUCCESS AT IC
This term Dram. Soc. pre-
sented their two prize-winning
entries in the ULU One-Act
Play Festival. The first play,
" The Hole," by N. F. Simpson
(produced by Martin Moyes),
won 1st Prize in the Fresher's
Class.
The Hole
When the curtain opens, a vis-
ionary is sitting by a hole in the
road, next to a very realistic look-
ing mound of earth. He sees a
church down there and is waiting
for them to unveil a stained glass
window. Three men come in, re-
presenting the establishment.
According to them he is out of his
mind because it is obvious that
there are men down there playing
cards with boxing gloves on. On
the surface they are talking non-
sense but there is a lot of truth
behind it. The highly stylised
dialogue between the men was
very fast and repetitive and was
done very well. They poke fun
at all sections of society, the
church, politicians, scientists and
" the man in the street." The
two old women, gossiping about
their husbands in the background
were very amusing. One hus-
band was breathing out when he
should have been breathing in.
To put it right he was trying to
breath out twice running.
Best Actor
" Little Brother, Little Sister,"
by G. C. Menotti (produced by
John Slater-Haines) won 2nd
prize in the main class. The scene
is a fallout shelter in 2000 A.D.
The acting in this play was excel-
lent. John Golder and Lesley
Slater play the brother and sister
who have been brought up by
their tyrannical old cook (su-
perbly acted by Roger Haines),
unaware of what has happened.
Cook threatens to make them into
rissoles if they dare to open the
door and go outside. The ending
of the play is very effective. The
door is off-stage and when event-
ually the children do open it, all
that is seen is a shaft of light
across the stage.
No Telephone
Unfortunately " The Tele-
phone" could not be performed
on Thursday due to illness, but
even so the audience had a good
evening's entertainment.
"Hie Hole": nonsense with a Tot oi truth behind it.
