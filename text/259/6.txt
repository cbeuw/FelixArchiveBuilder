The Frontiers
of Human
Ignorance
STEVE MALLINSON.
There is a dusty little office in
the grimy heart of one (or many)
of our major cities. It is filled
with little men whose sole aim in
life is to persecute students. At
irregular intervals they send re-
quests to students—they would
be grateful if one would fill in
the enclosed form and return it
with one's National Insurance
card. If like myself one has lost
not merely the present but the
last three cards they go into a
frenzy of delight and choose
another form—at random, it
seems—which must also be filled
in (if the answer is " no " write
"no," a dash is not sufficient).
On one occasion I was sent a
large sheet of paper which asked
whether I had taken a commission
in the Merchant Navy.
This is a mental picture which
I cannot shake off my mind. It
is a natural reaction to human
idiocy—and what typifies this
more than the blind obedience to
" the System " that form-filling
requires. I am amazed at the
moment by the number of firms
who wish to know not merely my
father's occupation but my " O '
level marks. The assumption
that the forms were concocted by
an idiot with a sense of humour
—no one else could remember
and compare the irrelevant in-
formation requested—is difficult
to avoid.
This distribution of signalless
noise is not confined to forms.
Have any of the letters to the press
on the recent student disturb-
ances really said anything useful?
Who are these people writing to
Gordon-Walker, and what form
do these letters take ? Aren't
these also examples of word flow-
ing about with little purpose and
less effect ; aren't they just stereo-
typed reactions which the ever-
yielding public reads and is ex-
pected to absorb with gratitude ?
Another major area of surplus
communication is advertising.
The same message is repeated at
vast cost in time and money and
the main purpose, it seems, is to
keep the competing products at
the same level in the public con-
sciousness. Would people really
feel deprived if half the hoard-
ings in this country were torn
down, half the stream of circu-
lars one receives were never sent?
All this vast amount of paper—
mostly ignored—must surely *be
measured in forests of wood and
millions of pounds—-and isn't
it a waste of time.
Professor Elliot in his recent
inaugural lecture warned that the
present computer revolution was
a grave danger in that the ma-
chines are all too capable of
swamping us in facts to such an
extent that we will be incanablc
of reading let alone using all the
tabulated output. He stressed
the need to reduce the output to
simply understood graphs and
visual display both of which
may be easily and rapidly under-
stood and, if no longer needed,
discarded.
There is, I think, an essential
distinction between information
and facts. The number of the
latter which flow, to very little
purpose, into filing cabinets, mag-
netic tapes, reports, tables of re-
sults and all too rarely into waste
bins not only waste time and
money but tend to swamp us to
the extent that we cannot stand
back and absorb the information,
if any, that they contain.
We must have new criteria of
efficiency: are the waste-bins
full, the filing cabinets empty ?
People must take precedence over
systems. Someone must be able
to say " Enough." We must try
to question the questions (they're
more important than the answers)
and then perhaps the dusty office
could close and the little men be
pensioned off.
We must stop pushing forward
the frontiers of human ignorance
or we shall become a race know-
ing more and more facts about
more and more subjects and
knowing less and less about
them.
ARE T H E Y
MANIPULATING
YOUR MIND ?
About fifty prospective pub-
licity officers, or just interested
people attended a talk on " Ad-
vertising — Manipulation of the
Mind" by Mr. Robert Brandon,
the head of an advertising
agency, sent along by the Adver-
tising Association. His talk dealt
mainly with generalities about
the planning of advertising cam-
paigns, rather than with the
specifics of producing advertise-
ments, and turned out to be
rather dull.
He contrasted the old-fash-
ioned statistical approach—
What are we selling ?
To whom are we selling ?
When are we selling ?
Where are we selling ?
with the psychological approach
of David Ogilvy—
To whom are you talking ?
What do you want to say ?
What is in it for them ?
What are we trying to sell ?
Extremes
He used two pages from a re-
cent Sunday paper colour sup-
plement to illustrate extremes of
the two basic kinds of advertis-
ing. One was an advert for a
cigar and was largely irrelevant
to the product, using most of the
space talking about celebrating,
and then suggested that when you
want to celebrate you should
have a cigar. The object behind
this was to implant the idea
which would come to the front of
the mind at the right time. The
other was an advert for a book
club, which had a reply paid
order form with it. Visual pre-
sentation was not so important
but the page was packed with
all the information necessary, as
the reader had to be persuaded
to buy books on the spot and not
have the idea implanted.
H istory
He then gave a short history
of advertising, saying that it was
started in the 1880's by William
Hesketh (later Lord) Lever who
had the idea of packaging and
branding his own goods and then
getting other shops to sell them.
In 1887 Lever saw Millais's
"Bubbles" in the Royal
Academy, bought it and started a
tradition which survives to this
day of advertising Pear's soap
using this picture. The printing
machine was also instrumental in
getting the advertising revolution
under way. About one-quarter
of the people .employed in the
printing industry in the country
(80-100,000 out of 340,000) are
employed in advertising. There
are 18-20,000 people in the rest
of the industry. Because of ad-
vertising the number of people
selling goods to shops is drasti-
cally reduced and frees these
people for more creative activi-
ties.
He ended by giving some speci-
fic examples of advertising cam-
paigns which he considered good
and successful.
