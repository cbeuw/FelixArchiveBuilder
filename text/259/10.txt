HRY :
SETBACKS
At a General Studies lecture last week Humphry Berkeley, chair
man of the United Nations Association in Britain, explained the two
severe setbacks the campaign for humanrightshad received in this
country in the past three weeks.
Last December at a public meeting, members of all three political
parties had given their support to the broad aims of the campaign
which are to bring about an end to discrimination against women,
and people of different races, both in Britain and her remaining
colonies. He accused the Lord Chancellor and Mr. Quintin Hogg of
being " shabby in the extreme " for having disclosed these aims only
three months before supporting the 1968 Commonwealth Immigrants
Act. Only the Liberal Party had emerged from that episode without
tarnishing their honour.
Kenyan Asians
The position of the Asians
in Kenya had been a problem
since 1963. Mr. Duncan Sandys,
who at that time was concerned
about the position of the 160,000
Asians in Kenya, had said that
as they did not satisfy Kenya's
condition for citizenship they
should be given U.K. passports.
The idea behind this plan was
that while these Asians were
achieving the conditions of citi-
zenship which is that at least one
parent is Kenya born, they would
have rights as British citizens.
Duncan Sandys had not envisaged
that they would come and settle
in Britain, but when this began to
happen hastily pointed out the
loophole in the law. In Kenya,
the Asians had to work using
work permits, and as preference
for jobs was given to Africans (or
rather Kenyan nationals) they
found work hard to find and some
came to this country—many
panicking after Duncan Sandys'
outbursts. The British Govern-
ment became unnecessarily dis-
turbed by an influx of about 1,500
people a year and produced the
Commonwealth Immigrants Act
which had a two fold effect. The
ULU
IN
ACTION
Our university union is run by
the Presidents' Council and its
various Sub-committees. PC's
membership is the president of
each constituent college of U L U
and one other rep from each col-
lege—the U L U agent. Between
them they must administer the
union and form the policy of the
members. It is the latter that has
been the centre of some interest-
ing controversy this session. The
matter arose when the U L U
rugby club played a fixture
against an all white South African
university touring team, contrary
to a directive from President's
Council, who asserted that the
fixture was contrary to Union
policy made in 1965—that " the
university does not take part in
fixtures against South African
teams "—and that the fixture was
against the union's anti-aparheid
policy. The issue seems now to
have become a thinly veiled rift
between the sports clubs commit-
tees, who maintain that clubs may
compete against whom they wish,
and Presidents' Council, which
naturally wants to retain its
sovereignty. The split will come
to an interesting head at the next
meeting of the PC in May when
the motion that " The Presidents'
Council resolves that all Commit-
tees of the Union must be bound
to implement policy decisions of
the Presidents' Council," will be
debated.
President Elected
The election for President of
ULU for next session was held at
the Council meeting on Monday
the 11th March. It was a closely
fought election in which Roger
ten years came in ten days and
that those left behind had a basic
right removed as it became im-
possible for some of them to enter
this country for 40 or 50 years.
Barbaric Hangings
Turning to Rhodesia Humph-
rey Berkley described the recent
hangings as barbaric. He said
that while the men were guilty of
vile murders they had been kept
under sentence for three years
which was a good basis for a re-
prieve. He added that as the right
of appeal to the Privy Council had
been refused and the Royal Pre-
rogative of mercy had been
denied the hangings were illegal.
Majority Rule?
The arguments for supporting
the Smith regime were question-
able. The one that the Africans
are not ready to govern looks ri-
diculous when countries like
Zambia and Malawi, which are
at the same state of development
as Southern Rhodesia have gained
independence. He felt that he
could only laugh at those who be-
lieved that anyway Africans
would achieve majority rule in
15 years time. Under the 1961
constitution certain conditions
must be fulfilled before full voting
rights can be achieved, primary
amongst these being secondary
education. The Smith regime was
pouring plenty of money into pri-
mary education, but had actually
refused a British government
grant for secondary education. He
feared that there seemed no basis
for negotiation, bloodshed might
be the only solution as the British
Government with its history of
successful decolonisation must
never surrender to the 215,000
whites in Rhodesia.

ordinating officer, narrowly de-
feated fellow UC man, Fred

Sennet Sabbatical?
At last there is some hope of
having a decent University news-
paper, as some progress is being
made in instituting a sabbatical
year for the Editor of Sennet—a
move that I feel may well go a
long way towards remedying the
present appalling position.
Finally should any member of
the union be interested in the con-
duct of his affairs then he is en-
titled to observe meetings of the.
Presidents' Council from the gal-
lery of the Council room.

Economic Development is often talked about by economists in
abstract. Some do not seem to realise that they are really talking
about relieving people of poverty. "Poverty," Dr. Schumacher
thought was the key word when telking of development. He was
was starting the seminar on Technology and Economic Development
organised by the Indian Society and the International Relations Club
on Thursday, 14th March.
After having seen a harrowing film on the Bihar famine last week,
one which had to be stopped in the middle because of the extreme
misery shown in it, part of the audience were in no doubt about the
need for and meaning of economic development for the uner-
developed part of the world. Dr. Schumacher started off by saying
that since the vast majority of people in the poor countries live in
villages that is the sector we should be endeavouring to develop. He
asserted that very soon we will have to stop the rush to cities since
they are reaching their saturation point: indeed, one only has to look
at Calcutta in India or Lima in Peru to realise the gravity of the
situation. Having accepted that an incessant flow of people into
cities will cause chaos: breakdown of services, mass unemployment
and hunger, one is led to the inescapable conclusion that people will
have to remain on the land and this is only possible if their agricul-
tural methods are improved. Dr. Schumacher believes that the way
to do this is not ti give the peasants a sophisticated tractor or a
combine-harvester but to try and find something between that and the
sickle. This he calls the application of Intermediate Technology. His
Intermediate Technology group has prepared a catalogue of relatively
simple tools available in England and the group tries to make this
information availabe to people in the poor countries. Groups similar
to his have now been established in India, Peru, Columbia and the
West Indies. He gave various examples of how these groups had
helped in saving large amounts of money by providing information
on simple tools which can do the same task as very much more
expensive and sophisticated tools wholly inappropriate to the rural
economies. ,. . .. .
tions to it since it is unreasonable
to expect Western firms to forego
their royalties from developing
countries. To get round the prob-
lem Dr. Oldham suggested the
formation of an International
Technology Agency which would
have two basic functions: (i)
Technological and Economic, and
(ii) Legal. It would advise firms
in the poor countries on the kind
of technological help they should
have and then give them legal
advice on the intricacies of patent
laws. He suggested that the rich
countries could give the licensing
fees as aid : e.g. if a French firm
was to receive some royalties the
French Government could give
them to it in French currency and
as a result all concerned would be
happy : the poor country gets ap-
propriate technology free, the
firm gets its royalties regularly
and easily and the French
Government gives aid in its own
currency and helps a French firm
simultaneously. Despite this in-
Free Technology
Dr. Oldham of the Sussex
Science Policy Research Unit
spoke on the paper his unit has
presented at UNCTAD in New
Delhi on " Technology Transfer
to Developing Countries: the
Role of Licensing Agreements."
Under the present international
national patent and licensing
laws the poor countries pay enor-
mous amounts to the rich coun-
tries with their scarce foreign ex-
change resources in buying their
technical know-how. Approxi-
mately £1 billion are paid annu-
ally in licensing agreements of
which the United States gets ap-
proximately 57 per cent of all
payments though it itself pays out
only 12 per cent. While it seems
obvious that this is an undesirable
situation it is difficult to find solu-
genious suggestion some members
of the audience were all for the
poor countries pirating techno-
logy and forgetting about patent
laws !
Turn-Key Projects
Mr. John White gave a spirited
defence of the viability and use of
Turn-Key Projects which he de-
fined as " projects (usually large)
carried out by a contractor and
handed back to the purchaser
when they are operational." He
first decried all the "One reason"
theories of development like that
of Dr. Schumacher and stressed
the multiplicity of problems that
have to be faced when talking of
development. It was in this con-
text that he spoke of the uses of
large Turn-Key projects. The
objections raised against thesse are
usuually with reference to past
projects which have failed. These
he said were usually because of
difficulties in the practical admin-
istration of these plants and he
gave the examples of the new
steel plants in India. Thus the
principle, or the potential use and
viability of large turn-key projects
is, in fact, usuually not ques-
tioned.
Science Policy
Mr. Nigel Calder, the well
known science journalist and
former editor of the " New Scien-
tist," spoke on the need for sci-
ence policy in developing coun-
tries to decide effective resource
allocation. He stressed the need
for long term general planning
and questioned the efforts of the
poor countries in merely aping
the rich western countries. He
seemed to be of the view that the
poor countries should try to de-
velop their own technologies ap-
propriate to their societies. This
was not to say that they should
go through the same industrialis-
ing process that Europe went
through but their methods should
be entirely new.
The meeting was a very in-
structive and fruitful one and
some novel ideas were heard.
There seems the obvious need for
people to devote more time on
these problems and, as Mr.
Calder said, some basic re-think-
ing is essential and delve in Wes-
tern Technology totally inappro-
priate to their own countries ?

AT C B W
Javad (Adolphe) Hashterou-
dian, a third year Chemist, has
formed a group within the Inter-
national Relations Club to in-
vestigate the use of Chemical and
Biological Warfare in Vietnam.
They are at present compiling the
information and hope to publish
their results in the summer term.
Wherever possible they hope to
use only information from Wes-
tern sources and as much techni-
cal and scientific data from open
literature as possible. They are
in fact having difficulty because
there is so little information in
the literature and so much of it
conflicts. The report is to be as
unemotional as possible.
Non -lethal ?
They have evidence from N F L
sources that chemical warfare is
being used but they are disre-
garding this information and us-
ing only that gleaned from Wes-
tern reporters. The Americans
claim that the only chemicals
they are using are anti-foliants
which they say do not harm
people. They also admit to using
ami-riot gases. These are how-
ever marked, " Not to be used in
cases where death is to be
avoided." One of the compounds
the Americans are using is caca-
dilic acid. This is arsenic and
the minimum lethal dose is 182
mg per kg bodyweight. Even so
the US claims this just passes
through the body without any
harmful effects.
When asked why he and his
committee were compiling this
report, Mr. Hashteroudian said
that as he thought this was a
scientific college and many
people may in future be involved
in this type of warfare, it was
only fair {hat they should know
what it entails.
MORE ULU
Language Bank
One of the first constructive
things U L U has done in living
memory is to instigate a language
bank scheme. Initially envisaged
as a totally independent project,
it is now proposed that we should
operate in conjunction with the
Camden Committee for Commu-
nity Relations who already have a
small similar scheme. The idea
is to provide people who are wil-
ling to act as translators for
recent immigrants, foreigners in-
volved in the law courts or just
anyone who needs an interpreter.
The area in which ULU, and
more particularly IC, can help is
to act as a source of recruitment.
However the entire success of tins
worthwhile project lies in finding
sufficient volunteers to offer to
put their name into the language
pool. So if any of you are willing
to help and are proficient in any
language other than English
would you contact Rory Red-
mayne in 96 New Beit (or via the
Civ. Eng. or Union racks) as soon
as possible so that London Uni-
versity may start to play an active
part right away.

Sinclair Goodlad, President of
the H G Wells Society since its
formation in 1963, is to retire
(from being President) at the end
of this session. The job is to be
taken over by Lord Jackson of
Burnley, Pro-R.ector of the Col-
lege.
Mr. Goodlad is also giving up
the Sub-Wardenship of Tizard
Hall this Easter as he is getting
married.
INSTANT
PUBLICITY
Due to the present grotty state
of publicity within the Union, the
S.C.C. has in its wisdom decided
to hold a teach-in on Publicity at
the beginning of next term.
Subjects covered will include
handling of Gestefax. Dyelines
also poster design. Open to all
the College, but especially for
future Publicity Officers. Any
enquiries to Robin Dibblee,
Tizard Hall.
CARNIVAL
RAFFLE
Everyone is reminded to sell
(and buy) raffle tickets for Carni-
val. The main prize of a Murphy
colour television set will be
awarded to the winner of a
separate competition between the
fifty people selected by the
draw, for which the first prize is
a Pentax Sia camera, second
prize a Grundig TK 145 tape re-
corder and third prize a Russell
Hobbs electric coffee percolator.
There will also be a prize for the
person who sells most tickets.
There will be a great chance
over Easter to sell tickets. Any-
one who thinks he may be able to
sell more tickets than have been
allocated to him, or has sold out
can obtain more from his year
rep or for PGs from Bernie New,
Maths 2B or 642 Tizard Hall.
