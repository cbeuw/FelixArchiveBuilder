Despite the fact that the Easter
term is drawing to its folk-song
oriented conclusion, Guilds' acti-
vity contniues unabated. Guiulds
—Mines Carnival was the usual
great night out for all who went.
Chief attraction, Arthur Brown,
lived up to his fiery reputation
and the discotheque, supporting
groups, steel band—and even
Mooney—came up to expecta-
tions.
The Sunday following was the
occasion of the Guilds' Soccer
Sixes—won by Civil II from Civil
I in the final—when the Old Cen-
tralians' Cup was awarded for the
first time. It was, of course, suit-
ably initiated in the bar after-
wards. Chemical Engineering I
won the Losers' Cup in the most
amusing final ever to be seen on
any soccer(?) pitch.
Tuesday, 12th. was the first
Guilds' Paper Dart Competition.
It was organised by Aero. Soc.
but won, ironically enough, by
Mike Beck of Civil I, who pro-
jected his winning entry with
more vigour than acro-dynamic
precision. The competition was
watched in sheer bewilderment
from the Electrical and Civil De-
partments—and in sheer terror as
the revolutionary circular entries
from Bill Caruthers and Mike
Clay collided with various dis-
tant buildings at high velocity,
winning their designers a special
prize for ingenuity.
Last Thursday was the Field
Cup which, after much confusion
and battle, was tied between the
pugnacious combatants from
Mech. Eng. I and Chem. Eng. I.
Mech. Eng. I, tirelessly led by
lan Jarvis, continued that evening
on their Carnival collecting spree,
trying to beat Mines' total on
their own ; well done, Mech. I!
It only remains to ask all
Guildsmen to turn up to support
their team in the Sparkes Cup this
afternoon, where we have an ex-
cellent chance of winning.
MACKMANIA
RCS have been shown up! Last
week's FELIX announced that
Guilds have collected more for
Carnival than we have. Some-
thing must be done. During the
last couple of days of term take
some collecting tins with you on
your end-of-term "celebration."
These can be obtained from John
Noakes, Garden 21. By now
books of raffle tickets should have
been distributed to all members
of College. Try hard to sell as
many as possible during the
Easter vacation. The first prize
is a colour T V which should in-
terest a lot of people. There is
also a prize to the person selling
the most tickets. It must be men-
tioned that Jez has been support-
ing Carnival. She and Bo accom-
panied by several private cars
went round the West End last
Saturday advertising the Donovan
Concert.
Congratulations again to Jezette
and drivers for their success in
the Pedal Car Race at Bristol. It -
was because of the racs, though,
that a rather embarra: ag incident
occured at the last Union meeting.
One of the trophy officers was at
the race and the other didn't turn
up, thus leaving Bob Mackman
and Rog Webb with Theta on
their hands. It was last seen
disappea: ing in the direction of
Beit Hall. That trophy officer
had better Buck up his ideas.
Last Thursday the RCSA held
a very successful sherry party. All
Third years should join before
they leave College. See Miss
Paget. Physics Terrapin Hut,
Room ID. There will be an A G M
of the RCSA sometime in May.
Support is needed for RCS.
There is a rugby match this after-
noon against Guilds at Harling-
ton. We are fighting for the
Sparks Cup, so if you have the
afternoon free come hiss the wily
Guildsmen. We were defeated
by Mines last Wednesday so we
need all the support we can get.
Good luck Physics I in your test
and if anyone has seen Ron Bass's
tooth, please return it as soon as
possible.

" Priorities that Matter "
Friday marks the end of the
Lent term, but for yet another
small minority, the women (you
know, the students who are a
differnt shape), it is also the cul-
mination of the year's activities
in the ICWA Formal Dinner
and Dance. This is to be held
in the Union and starts at 7.30
p.m. A l l the tickets for the
Dinner and Dance are sold out.
but there are still Buffet and
Dance tickets at 30/- double and
Dance only tickets at 17/6
double. However, having ob-
tained a ticket, your troubles are
only just beginning, for you have
to decide which of those gay,
debonair, handsome, dashing
. . . young men that are lurking,
nay hiding, somewhere in I.C.,
you will choose to escort you to
this sub-aqua evening. There-
fore here are some points to bear
in mind when making your mo-
mentous decision :
(a) If action and reaction are
equal and opposite, don't ask
him; but, remember every-
body continues in its state of
rest until an external force
acts upon it.
(b) Work on English dance floors
is measured in foot (hoof?)-
pound weight.
(c) Given any male x and any
time t,
x — exhaustion as t — 3 a.m.
(d) Moments of inertia can al-
ways be replaced, with a
constant gyration.
(e) The total mass of a given sys-
tem of bodies is constant,
even though collisions or
other actions take place.
And as a parting thought, for
those bent on imbibing heartih
(f) Gravitational attraction is a
minimum at ground level.

How to handle Banks and
Bank Managers
