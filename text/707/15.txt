SCI Fl SOC
The time
has come
'The time has come,
the Chairman said
to talk of many things,
of next year's films and cinema trips,
of magazines and things...'
And so it has! This Thursday there will be
an important meeting for SF Soc members
where we will discuss next year's activities. If
you want us to show a particular film, buy a
certain book for the library (you might even
be surprised to find we've already got it) or
invite a certain author to talk to us, then
come along to the Green Committee Room
at 1.00pm this Thursday—that's the top floor
of the Union Building.
Even more important—would anyone
interested in writing for the SF Soc magazine
please come along as well. This high quality
publication requires authors and will be
available at the start of next term. All help will
be gratefully received, and who knows, our
magazine might lead to greater things. See
you all on Thursday!

BIOTECHNOLOGY
Sweet
swindles
Margaret Thatcher makes much of free
market economics, but there is no such thing
as a free market in food commodities
according to Tate and Lyle's Director of
Research, Prof Renton Righelato. He
described the hard realities of agricultural
price wars. Sugar prices, for example are
fixed in the US and Europe to protect
farmers, while poor Third World countries
must sell at well below the cost of
production. For them it may be their only
commodity and they are desperate for
foreign exchange.
It is worth making fuel from sugar cane.
Not for profit, but countries like Brazil prefer
it to paying valuable dollars for oil. Prof
Righelato showed that a hard-headed look at
prices is needed to decide which
biotechnologies might be profitable in this
country, and which would need more
compelling justification. Making meat from
cereals using a cow is highly inefficient, but
the price per ton that people will pay is so
high that the process still makes money.
Making medical or specialist products is one
of few ways biotechnological conversions
that can make a profit.
Making the very sweet high-fructose
syrups from maize is big businees in the USA
because of high sugar prices. The same
could be true in Europe (the prices are right)
but when companies began investing in this
biotechnology an E E C ban froze
development. As Prof Righelato pointed out,
industry may be encouraged by government
pricing but blocked by equally arbitrary
government laws. (Both in this case protect
European sugar beet farming).
In the early seventies making food from
microbes ('single-cell proteins') seemed like a
good idea. The raw materials (Petroleum,
gas, etc) were cheap, the fermenters used
less land than crop fields, and the proteins
made had an excellent balance of nutrients.
The oil crisis (or rather the OPEC price-hike)
and denser cropping destroyed many single-
cell protein development programmes.
Consumer conservatism was another
obstacle. Only a few huge companies could
continue and now ICI and Rank-Hovis-
McDougall are the lone survivors. Their
products (Pruteen and Mycoprotein) are
only now beginning to show their nutritional
worth. (Look out for Mycoprotein in your
superamarket steak and kidney pie).
Profesor Righelato gave us a picture of the
forces that sway huge industries: Our
Western protectionism, foreign exchanges,
our eating habits and prejudices, wars and
cartels, inability to tackle very long term
investments, and sometimes blindness to
new technologies. Biotechnology is not
simply about making money: the politics and
innovation process make it far more
interesting than that!
