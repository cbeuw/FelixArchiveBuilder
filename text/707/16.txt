Mining success
On Sunday, the two teams that
had battled their respective ways
to the Imperial College Cup
Football Final (for Residents)
took to the task of deciding the
Cup Holders for 1985-86. Early
pitch inspection in Hyde Park
had revealed more of a barren
strip of turf than the lush grass of
the Wembley surface that many
of the players were accustomed
to. However, make-shift posts
were installed and the game
commenced at 11.00am.
Hamlet Gardens first team
were quickly into their stride and
scored with a good shot early in
the game. Mining House first
team retaliated and were
rewarded by a penalty for hand-
ball taken ruthlessly by Guy
'Lucky Lad' Poppy. Soon
afterwards a head-clash between
John Burke of Mining and a
Hamlet defender lead to the
latter being taken to hospital with
an eye-wound requiring several
stitches. John Burke continued
to play but later received three
stitches to a cut in his head when
bits of brain were found on the
ball. This gave Mining an
unexpected advantage but all to
no avail as Hamlet quickly
scored again to lead two to one
with only ten men (visions of
Manchester United!!).
Mining were fast to turn the
tables. Jon Ager equalized with a
well-taken goal, involving a sprint
that would have left Carl Lewis
floundering. Indeed, Jon's effort
was such that his half-time
orange was found 'floundering'
outside the Zetland on his return
to Evelyn Gardens. Another goal
by Jon Ager followed by a
Hamlet own-goal within a minute
made the score four to two at half
time.

goal for Martin Brook to give
Mining a confident start to the
second period. However,
Hamlet dictated the run of the
play but were kept at bay by
some acrobatics by Dave Martin
in the Mining goal, he also made
some fine saves. A goal though,
for Hamlet, brought them back
into contention at five to three.
This contention was short-
lived for after some one-touch

Barrow and Ivan 'Elephant

put away his first and Mining's
sixth. Jon Ellis and Bruce
Ainsworth found the legs to keep
running in the energy-lapping
heat and created an opening for
Martin Brook to casually take his
second goal and end the final
seven to three to Mining House.
A fair season
Although we started the season
well by winning the ULU Water
Polo knockout cup (?) despite a
handicap of -6 goals, the rest of
the season wasn't so successful.
In the Southern Division of the
UAU tournament we finished
second to Bristol, the eventual
runners up in the final. Although
we played badly on the day, it's
fair to say that Bristol fought
harder for the ball and deserved
their place in the final. In the play
off for the last place in the final,
we lost 7-6 under dubious
circumstances to Lough-
borough. We found it frustrating
not to be able to defend the titfe
we'd won last year, although
Birmingham had such a strong
squad we would have been
competing for runner up medals
only.
The swimming team, although
small in number, were far more
successful. By doubling the
number of tournaments they
entered, they were able to
compete twice. Like the water
polo squad they were able to win
the U L U championship
comfortably for the umpteenth
time. The main event, however,
was their first entry in the UAU
long course championships held
at Liverpool. A four man team
was sent, comprising Dave
Brocklebank, Ian Ruddle, James
Pearson, and Paul Richardson.
Even though only nine out of a
total of 24 events were
contested, they still finished third
overall against much larger
tearrfs. James Pearson came
second in the 100m backstroke
and third in the 100m freestyle,
with the relay team finishing
second in the medley and fourth
in the free style events. Next year
we shall be entering the UAU
sprint championships and also
hope to be able to find a womens
team in order to compete against
other universities.
Colours were awarded to the
swimming team of Pearson,
Brocklebank, Ruddle and
Richardson, and half colours to
Nick Ireland and Dave Wall for
water polo. Thanks to Stuart
Chorlton and Paul Richardson
for all their hard work this year.
