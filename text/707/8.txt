Where to look
Student Services 15, Princes Gardens
SW7; Tel 589 5111 ext 3601; Open weekdays
9.30-5.30.
Student Services produces lists of
accommodation, available on production of
a Union Card. These lists are up-dated
frequently during September but the
impossiblity of getting hold of large numbers
of landlords everyday to check whether their
accommodation is still available means that
you can never be sure that places on the list
haven't gone. The newest ones are added on
to the end of the list so it is best to start at the
bottom and work up.
University of London Accommodation
Office
Union Building, Malet Street, W C 1 ; Tel 636
2818;
Open weekdays 9.30-l.OOpm, 2-5.30pm.
The University Accommodation office has
details of accommodation all over London.
They operate a noticeboard system. One
thing worth noting is that you have to
produce proof that you belong to the
University and that if you are, say, looking for
a flat for four, you all have to go along
together, at least on your first visit.
Flat Agencies and Estates Agents
See list
Agents tend to charge for their services
either by extracting one to two weeks rent as
an agents fee or by charging you for 'drawing
up the agreement' ie filling in a few blanks on
a standard form. This is usually in the order
of £30. Flat agencies tend to fall into the
former category while Estate Agents, who
get most of their money from the landlord are
usually content with charging for the
agreement.
Agents are not allowed to charge you
unless and until you accept something off
their books. Unfortunately there are agents
who try to circumvent this by charging a
registration fee or by other dubious devices.
You need to keep an eye out for this if you
use agents and read with care any form that
they give you to sign when you first go in.
Newspapers
See list
Noticeboards
Many newsagents have noticeboards which
display offers of accommodation in amongst
the second hand vinyl settees and invitations
to ring Miss Bond. The trouble with these is
that they tend to hang around long after the
aceommdation has gone. Look out for dates
written on by the shopkeeper and
concentrate on the newest one.

Equipment

Equipment List
Before starting out on your search you need
to gather together a few pieces of essential
equipment which will either make your task
easier or give you an edge over the
competition.
1 A-Z map of London. Y o u will find this
invaluable in getting yourself to obscure back
streets before anyone else.
2 A bag of coins of suitable denominations
for the telephone and to save you queueing
for underground tickets.
3 Company let facilities. Many landlords
are only prepared to let to a corporate body,
partly to stop you getting security of tenure
and partly as a guarantee that you will pay
your rent and not wreck the place. The
College is prepared to provide this facility in
certain cases so check with Student Services
in advance to see whether, in principle, the
College will sign an agreement for you. It is
worth noting that much of the stuff from
estates agents is only available on a company
let basis.
4 A bank reference. Some landlords ask
for this so that they can ascertain whether or
not you are likely to be good at paying your
rent. Although not all landlords ask for one, a
bank reference produced voluntarily might
give you an edge if there are other people
chasing the accommodation at the same
time. If you don't have a reference and the
landlord wants one, you could lose the place
in the time it takes to get hold of one.
5 Character references. Useful to obtain in
advance as with bank references.
