RENT
UP5 %
STUDENT RENTS are to rise by 5% next session, the
Student Residence Committee (SRC) decided on
Wednesday. This compares with the 3% rise in student
grants announced last week.
The SRC voted six to five in
f a v o u r o f t h e i n c r e a s e
r e c o m m e n d e d by C o l l e g e
Financial Secretary Brian Lloyd
Davies. All the student members,
union representatives and
student wardens, voted against
with staff members voting for or
abstaining. This was the first time
for several years that a vote has
been necessary at a SRC meeting,
where previously a consensus has
always been reached.
The proposal accepted also
allowed for £100,000 to be taken
from the Residence Account
reserves, which stand at over
£200,000, to go towards the
expected £350,000 bill for work
in Southside necessary in the next
twelve months to comply with
fire regulations. This work will be
carried out whilst students are in
residence' and involves fitting
automatic door closing devices in
each room and replacing the
present glass partitions on
s t a i r c a s e s w i t h s t r o n g e r
partitions, as well as work on
communal areas to provide fire
doors.
The Residence A c c o u n t
reserve is built up from surpluses
generated each year and is
earmarked as a contribution to
the cost of increasing the number
of residence places, although no
firm guarantee that it will only be
used for this has ever been given
by College. There is increasing
pressure for it to be used to pay
for the soaring costs of major
maintenance work on present
residences, especially with the
C o l l e g e ' s reserves b e i n g
increasingly stretched as further
Government cuts take effect. The
increase in rents by 5% will
generate an estimated £56,000
which will be added to the
reserves, whereas a 3% rise in line
with the grant increase would
raise only a p p r o x i m a t e l y
£33,000.
The rises mean an extra £ 1.30 a
week on Southside, Linstead and
Weeks singles, taking them to
£27.30. New rates for other
categories will be: New Beit and
Montpellier singles £25.20;
Garden Hall, Evelyn Gardens
and Old Beit singles £23.60,
Linstead and Montpellier
doubles £19.60; Garden Hall and
Evelyn Gardens doubles, and
Beit basement £18.00; Garden
Hall and Evelyn Gardens triples
£13.65.
The proposal passed by the
SRC now takes the form of a
recommendation to the Rector,
who will make the final decision
about rents. In previous years the
SRC's recommendation has
always been accepted.
GRANTS
U P 3%
STUDENT AWARDS will rise by 3% next academic year,
it was announced last Friday by the Department of
Education and Science.
Undergraduates not living at
home and studying in London
will receive £2,165 (up from
£2,100) whereas those living at
home will get £1,480 (up from
£1,435).
Postgraduates not living at
home and studying in London
will receive £3,265 (up from
£3,170) whereas those living at
home will get £1,960 (up from
£1,905).
Additionally, for under-
graduate grants, the minimum
maintenance award will be
a b o l i s h e d a n d p a r e n t a l
contributions for those in the
middle and upper reaches of the
scale will be increased.
The amount of other income a
student can receive before
deductions from the grant are
made is also increased. For
undergraduates, income up to
£425 will be disregarded and the
further disregard in respect of
payment by employers or monies
received through scholarships is
increased to £1,280. The latter
sum rises to £1,600 for National
Engineering Scholars. Post-
graduates have the disregard for
scholarship income, payment
from sponsoring employers and
renumeration for teaching or
demonstrating increased to
£1,230 (from £1,155).
U n d e r g r a d u a t e t r a v e l
contributions are increased by £5
across the board. Postgraduate
travel cost r e i m b u r s m e n t
arrangements remain unchan-
ged.
•It is feared that Housing Benefit
and Supplementary Benefit
during the long vacation will be
abolished for students as a result
of proposals shortly to be put
before parliament.
Student welfare experts see this
as an attempt to force students to
finance their own way through
college.
Further evidence for this is
provided by a Government
proposal which would lead to a
student's own income being
disregarded when assessing
grants.
