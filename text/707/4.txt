PRACTICALLY EVERYONE
has noticed the Ismaili Centre,
even if they don't even know its
name. It stands on the corner of
Exhibition Road and Cromweli
Road on an island site, and looks
toward three solid buildings in
the Western Classical style—the
Natural History Museum, the
Victoria and Albert Museum,
and the Brompton Oratory.
However, the Ismaili Centre
draws on very different cultural
roots, and reflects Islamic
traditions both internally and
externally. Work started on the
Centre about five years ago, and
it was officially opened in May. It
is designed to provide a religious,
social and cultural meeting place
for the 15,000 strong Ismaili
community in the UK. There are
about 60 million Ismailis
worldwide, mostly in Africa, Asia
and the Middle East. Many of the
Ismailis in Britain came here to
escape the turmoil of such
countries as Uganda over the
last 25 years. The spiritual head
of the Ismailis is the Aga Kahn,
who had a personal hand in the
design of the Centre.
The building houses a prayer
hall, exhibition gallery,
conference room, and social hall,
and also has a rather delightful
roof garden.
The architecture of the centre
is fascinating. Materials used
extensively include teak, marble
and granite and the colours and
designs draw heavily on tradition
Islamic themes. Of particular
interest is the entrance hall. The
small fountain burbling in a
heptagonal raised pool of blue
Brazilian marble can clearly be
seen from outside, and this is set
in a floor of white marble with an
intricate design based on the
same symbolic seven-sided
figure.
Much of the building is already
in use, and the Zamana gallery
will open soon, showing
exhibitions on mainly Islamic
themes to the public.
As the photographs bear out,
the Ismaili centre is one of the
most architecturally original
buidlings in London. Perhaps the
College architect might take a
walk down Exhibiton Road.
