MAGAZINES
F u r t h e r e v i d e n c e t h a t
members of this College are
as clever as they think is
provided by PHOENIX, the
annual literary review. That
means poems and stories,
John. The Spectator liked the
last one, proclaiming it the
best student magazine in the
country. I can't compete with
that because I haven't read the
others. I can say, though, that
what we have here is a goody.
The look of the thing is less
unified than that of previous
'risings'. At o n e extreme,
some pages are pure Rag
Mag. At the other, well,
surprise yourself. In parti-
cular, Ken Mann's Chinese
Room and Aquilon's Tunnel
Vision are clever prose. The
first is a short story in the
Tomorrows World mode. The
second is a remarkable piece
about the disorientation of a
visitor to L o n d o n . Ruth
Yeoman's poems and Howard
Rudd's photographys also
derserve attention.
As a whole, the magazine
provides entertaining light
reading, and is rather more
fun to read in the bath than,
say, Mathematical Methods
for Science Students,
although it might not make
you as rich. At the recom-
mended price of two-and-
sixpence PHOENIX is the
cheapest way to make your
coffee table pretentious.
OPERA
Cosi Fan Tuttc
D i d y o u s e e S c h a f f e r ' s
Amadeus? Th e play about
Mozart. Then this might grab
your interest. One of Wolferl's
Operas is being performed at
the Royal Opera House. Find
out what was behind Salieri's
filtering paranoia. Oh, yes, it's
all there—perfect harmonies,
coquettish, giggly h u m o u r -
but no farting jokes.
An opera is a startling thing.
First, the careful construction
allows balance in every
aspect. The voices are chosen
so that their timbres both
carry the character and blend
with those of the other
singers. T h e orchestra is
correct within itself and still
supports the voices without
any apparent conflict of r6les.
Obsession extends even to
stage design. The combinat-
i o n of p e r f o r m e r s a n d
b a c k g r o u n d g i v e s t h e
impression of a painting set in
motion. A n d loudly—the
p o w e r of t h e t h i n g is
marvellous.
Flat spots? Definitely not.
The orchestra take a few
minutes of the overture to
settle in, but that's what
overtures are for. Perhaps
Fiordiligi (Margaret Price)
was short of breath on the last
note of an otherwise stunning
Come Scoglio Immoto Resta,
but it was hard to tell through
the applause. In short, what
we have here is three hours of
joy and excellence. Allow
another ten minutes for the
standing ovation.
So you would rather go see
Dire Straits at Wembley. Well
fuck you. Me, I sing in the
kitchen. La Mia Dorabella...
