Chaos
D E S P E R A T E T A C T I C S were
employed by extreme left-wing
delegates at Tuesday's meeting of
the University of London Union
General Union Council ( U L U
GUC) to avoid motions critical
of the NUS's new purchasing
organisation the N a t i o n a l
Student Services Organisation
(NSSO) being passed. They
challenged the quorum and
walked out of the room, leaving
the meeting inquorate.
The NSSO was set up amid
controversy over its membership
policy which will exclude student
unions not affiliated to the N U S
(as reported in F E L I X 701).
U L U itself is not in the NUS, and
is not eligible to join since it is not
a student union as such but part
oTf the University administration.
Many other University of
London colleges are not in N U S
including Kings College and
most medical schools as well as
ICU. Consequently the U L U
Executive had proposed a
motion calling for London to set
up its own separate student union
purchasing consortium if NSSO
was not reformed.
Conscious of the damage the
NUS will suffer if the NSSO is not
a success, delegates from a
number of colleges led by the
Institute of Education decided to
end the meeting when the agenda
reached this motion. After they
left the meeting was narrowly
inquorate and had to be closed
much to the disgust of those
remaining.
Pay
Chaos
T H E S E N A T E of the University
of London has called on the vice-
chancellor Sir Randolph Quirk
to lobby MPs on the effects of
lecturers' pay erosion.
The Senate warned of 'the
deleterious effect of the
continued erosion of university
salaries both on the morale of
teachefs and the quality of future
recruitment of teachers to the
university'.
The Association of University
Teachers (AUT) has rejected a
4% pay offer.

Hamlet
Success
R E C E N T N E G O T I A T I O N S
have concluded that, all being well,
Hamlet Gardens will be available
to IC students for at least the next
three years.
The landlords, strollmoor Ltd,
had initially required a large
increase in rents which would
then have reflected the market
rents in the private sector.
Following discussion between
the College and the landlords,
they very kindly accepted that
this would present significant
difficulties for the students and
the College and subsequently
agreed to a phased increase over
the next three years.
After long negotiations, the
rents next year at Hamlet will be
£30 for a single room, and £26.50
or £25 .OOpppw for a double room
depending upon which block.
ICU President Ian Bull said that
his s o l u t i o n came as a
consequence of the good work
put in by Don Clarke, Estates
Secretary and Michael Arthur,
Student Services.
Vacancies still exist for a
Warden and a student manager
at Hamlet Gardens for next
session. Further details and
application forms are available
from IC Union office. The
closing date for application is
Friday 21 June.
Grants
Chaos
S T U D E N T S , p a r t i c u l a r l y
freshers, will face delays in
receiving their grant cheques next
academic year, due to the
lateness of the announcement of

applications and issuing cheques
in time for the new year.

announced in April, whereas this
year it was 31 May.
