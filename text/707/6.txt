Here is another of my favourite puzzles which I have saved until
last.
As most of us know, the only socially acceptable way of
eating Rech Tai biscuits is to dunk them in coffee and then
nibble at the soggy bits. If, then, we have a full cup of coffee of
diameter D, what is the largest circular biscuit which may be
completely eaten, with just four dunks into the coffee?
The puzzle in its original form (from Jeremy Smith) used just
three dunks but required extra constraints to prevent a trivial
solution. There are many different stategies for the four dunk:
problem but in this one the most interesting method does give
tbe largest biscuit diameter.
I used the following recursion formula to check the solution
was the best of all the methods, but you can solve the problem
without it by generalising the arguments used in the three dunk
problem.
Solutions to me by Monday 17 June.
There have been no offers to take over the column from me
and if no one comes forward it will have to fold, which would be
a shame. If anyone had thought of taking over they need not be
interested in the sort of puzzles I have used, indeed a totally
different line would probably make a good change.
