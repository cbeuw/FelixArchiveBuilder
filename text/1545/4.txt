Cocktail party changed
Imperial given
women in science
award
to serve alcohol. Any alcohol served
on campus must be served in accord-
ing to the licence or there is a risk
of losing it. The Chemistry Cocktail
Party had to change the format and
is now being moved to Metric, with
staﬀ at Metric serving the drinks in-
stead. There will also be a cap on the
number of cocktails that attendees
can have as each student may be given
four tokens and no more. This is due
to licensing as irresponsible drinking
can not be promoted.
The Chemistry Cocktail Party, like
many other departmental events, is
organised and run by students. It is
usually one of the highlights of the
year for chemists. It has been held in
various locations around College in
the past, from the Physics common
room in Blackett to the Chemistry
common room. Alcohol is served
by students on the ChemSoc Com-
mittee and/or volunteers with vari-
ous diﬀerent cocktails being devised
(mostly based on chemistry related
jokes). The alcohol is usually read-
ily available and most attendees take
full advantage; the event often ends
up providing a lot of memories and
lapses in memories for those who at-
tend. At the end of the party many
students would move onto the Un-
ion. It has been running in a similar
fashion for a few years. In previous
years there have been varying degrees
of incidents at the party, although all
of these incidents have been resolved
later.
Imperial College London have created
a paper on the future Education and
Student Experience strategy. Between
now and Friday 10 May staﬀ, students,
and alumni are asked to give their
views on the outcome. Views are being
sought for actions proposed and on
what to prioritise. To contribute on-
line, go to the following website: http://

strategy. There will also be two open
meetings on 17 April from 13.00 -14.00
in the Read Lecture Theatre, Sherfield
Building and on 25 April from 17.00-
18.00 in the Clore Lecture Theatre,
Huxley Building.
Professor Debra Humphris, who is
heading up the strategy, said: “Your re-
sponses will inform a paper outlining
the Education and Student Strategy
and implementation plan which will
be considered by Management Board
in June and received by Council in
July.” The Management Board is one
of the highest Boards in College, and is
chaired by the President & Rector. The
College Council is ultimately responsi-
ble for College policy.
Humphris said: “I’m very grateful to
those who contributed their time and
ideas in the initial consultation. We
received a wide range of responses
from staﬀ, students and alumni, not
only through our online consultation
but also at the open meetings and in
discussion with student reps and sab-
baticals.”
Computer room 204 in the Library was
recently locked as their was training
scheduled. The door has a sign saying
it is booked. This meant that students
were unable to use the computers in-
side. However, there are days when
nobody has been seen in the room. A
student complained to the Library staff
about this and was told that it belongs
to ICT, who have recently started lock-
ing it.

Imperial College London has won an
award recognising support for the
careers of women in science, technol-
ogy, engineering, maths and medicine.
The Athena Swan silver status has
only been granted to three universi-
ties, with Queen’s University Belfast
and University of Nottingham being
the other two. It is a university wide
recognition. Athena Swan say that it
“recognises a signiﬁcant record of ac-
tivity and achievement by the univer-
sity in promoting gender equality and
in addressing challenges across their
STEMM departments”. Multiple De-
partments at Imperial also currently
hold Silver status.
When the award was conferred the
panel noted various initiatives in De-
partments and College wide. These
included dinners, lectures, network-
ing events, and the Imperial women’s
portrait series.
Sir Keith O’Nions, President & Rec-
tor, released a statement saying: “Im-
perial is proud to be recognised with
institution-wide silver status. This is
the result of a serious long-term com-
mitment to gender equality at every
level in the College.” O’Nions said that
for Imperial to remain a world class
institution they must “continue to
eliminate obstacles to career progres-
sion and create new opportunities for
women.” He went on to stress the point
about remaining a world leader, say-
ing: “First and foremost, gender equal-
ity matters because it is the right thing
to do. But we also need to attract, pro-
mote and develop outstanding female
scientists if we are to maintain our
place as one of the world’s great uni-
versities.” Professor Dorothy Griﬃths,
Chair of Imperial College London’s
Academic Opportunities Committee,
said: ““Gender equality requires hard
work on a day-to-day basis. We intend
to keep this up and build on Imperial’s
signiﬁcant progress.”
The Athena Swan awards were cre-
ated in 2005 with Imperial a founding
member. Their Charter was launched
in June 2005 with three beliefs under-
pinning it. The beliefs include the im-
portance of women being represented
in a traditionally maile-dominated
area, and that “science cannot reach
its full potential unless it can beneﬁt
from the talents of the whole popula-
tion”. Any higher education instiution
is able to apply for membership.

Imperial
rises in
student
satisfaction
table
Imperial College London have placed
41 in the Times Higher Education
Student Experience Survey. This is up
from a position of 71 last year. Uni-
versity of East Anglia came top of the
table, with Oxford in second and Shef-
ﬁeld in third.
The area that Imperial seemed to
stand out most in was the “Fair Work-
load” category. Imperial came bottom
of the table for this category.
The table, which is now in its eighth
year, was produced using responses
from students who were polled be-
tween September 2011 and Septem-
ber 2012. The table takes into account
21 aspects of university life. These
parameters range from the academic
side of life to the social.
