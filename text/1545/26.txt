This week you are transformed
into a dog and it’s great: you
can lick your own genitals! But
frustrated by the lack of adult
TV aimed at canines, you set
up your own post-watershed
channel. The evening sched-
ule warms up with leg-humping
and bum-sniffing, and moves
on to leashes and collars as the
night goes on. Mmm bestiality.
This week you are too skint
to buy condoms and substi-
tute with a trusty sheep in-
testine. But it splits, coating
her sheets in semi-digested
grass. Not to worry though:
you bite into your overdraft
and split both the cost of her
laundry and the morning af-
ter pill: you are a true gentle-
man <3
This week you and your se-
cret crush are on a desert is-
land, and the only 2 humans
left in the world (score!). You
get together to save mankind
from extinction but realise
that your children would have
to copulate to propagate the
human race. An end to hu-
manity or incestuous chil-
dren: you decide…
This week you need metre-long
lines of caffeine powder to get
you through revision, and la-
ment that you have neither the
time nor money to swap it for
something stronger. It will all be
worth it when you have that city
salary though, and your stuck-
up children will enjoy the hedo-
nistic lifestyle you have been
so cruelly denied.
This week you find a sneaky
way of arousing yourself in
the library without the social
stigma associated with watch-
ing porn in public: Harry Pot-
ter fan-fiction. Reading about
how Draco and Hermione sati-
ate themselves in the Room of
Requirement really gets your
juices flowing while you study
fluid dynamics.
This week you go to the STI
clinic (as a responsible sexu-
ally inactive Imperialite) and
confidently take the swab to
the bathroom. But then it is
miraculously sucked into your
womb, where it grows into a
mucus-covered cotton-wool
baby. Congratulations, it’s a
girl, and her first word is ‘chla-
mydia’. You must be so proud!
This week an exciting-looking
parcel addressed to your
neighbour arrives through your
letterbox: moral dilemma. You
ignore your conscience and
open it, but are devastated
when it later turns out to be an-
thrax spores. You die a regretful
and self-sacrificial death, while
your would-be assassinated
neighbour lives on oblivious.
This week you are not ready to
lose your virginity yet so turn to
anal sex as a hymen-preserv-
ing alternative. But the diges-
tive remnants coating your
back passage react unprec-
edentedly with your partner’s
ejaculate, immediately turning
to a dried superglue-like con-
sistency and cementing his
penis in your anus for life.
This week you lose the ability
to identify with people, and
are only able to empathise
with bikes. Your sleek, car-
bon fibre frame whispers that
you must do anything it takes
to promote the noble sport of
cycling. In your desperation
to keep it happy you alienate
your friends, ending up with
only its tribars to cry on.
This week you see how long
you can grow your pubes. You
lovingly condition them with
nutritious oils and lotions, even
caressing and singing to them
to coax them to grow. But they
become shy with all the atten-
tion and pressure, and curl up,
becoming horribly ingrown.
They become infected and ev-
eryone thinks you have an STI.
This week you really like some-
one but are too shy to say it
to their face. But while you’re
being cowardly, they hook up
with the girl next door and you
hear them having sex every
night. You develop voyeuris-
tic tendencies to patch up the
heartbreak, but are eternally
devastated it’s not you on the
other side of the wall.
This week you must choose
between having paperweights
clamped to your genitals or
nipples in place of nostrils. The
heavy hanging paperweights
could make your penis longer,
but wouldn’t be so ideal for la-
bia. The nipples would be less
uncomfortable but lactating
snot could hinder your credibil-
ity. What’s it going to be?
