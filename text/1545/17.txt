ceage’s second album You’re
Nothing is getting critics
frothing at the mouth, and for
good reason. It keeps the raw,
visceral vitality of their debut
album, New Brigade, and marries it
to a more intricate post-punk under-
current. In fact, whisper it, new track
‘Morals’ seems to be an attempt at a
pop song. The band have managed to
ride the initial wave of hype and are
now proving themselves to be a thrill-
ing live proposition.
Although Electrowerkz, located a
few minutes from Angel tube station,

looks like a small dive venue from the
outside, once you get inside it turns
out to be a some-
what cavernous
space, stretching
back for miles.
And Iceage man-
age to ﬁll it to-
night; as close to
a sell-out that you
are every likely to
see. It takes me
an absolute age to
scramble through
the bodies to
buy myself a Red
Stripe (oh how
stereotypical).
Electrowerkz used
to be a metal fac-
tory and it makes
an intriguing, if
not bewildering,
venue.
Iceage arrive on stage late, rude
and raucous, a manner most beﬁt-
ting the scary yoof of today, or so the
Daily Mail would have you believe.
Underneath the howls of new single
‘Ecstasy’ and old favourite ‘Collapse’,

however, lies an intelligent band who
share a certain something with Joy
Division. Some of
the standout tracks
from the new album
are ‘Coalition’ and
‘Wounded Hearts’
and they rouse the
moshpit into action.
The hardcore fans
at the front go wild
for ‘White Rune’
and ‘Remember’
but ‘You’re Nothing’
proves to be an un-
expected high point.
Half of the time
you cannot tell what
lead singer, Elias
Bender Rønnenfelt,
is singing but that is
not the point of the
night. It is the en-
ergy and viciousness of the set which
comes through; Elias spent more
time swinging from overhead pipes,
thrashing in the crowd and screaming
at the front row then standing by the
microphone.
You cannot write a review nowadays
about Iceage without mentioning the
controversy which they have courted;
the fascist ideology employed and the
fact that they sold branded switch-
blades at recent shows. The cynic in-
side me says that is a gimmick used
to startle the mainstream media into
giving them column inches, and boy
oh boy is it successful. Let us not for-
get that this is a band who oﬀered fans
the chance to buy locks of their hair so
Uni Music League is a unique pro-

Music has always
been a huge part
of all their lives
from a very young
age with inspira-
tions drawn from Marvin Gaye to
the Red Hot Chilli Peppers to Are-
tha Franklin. The result? An accom-
plished old-school sound with lyrics
akin to country story telling.
Despite only being together for a
short while, James and The Rabbit
Hole have already achieved so much.
Moulding their own version of rock
and roll out of solid funk beats and
a classic gritty tone, they have bar-
relled their way through Uni Music

After tonight it is clear that the at-

focussed on the epic gothic-tinged
hardcore bursts that Iceage are so
good at. The energy which they played
with shook the foundations of Elec-

very old twenty two year old indeed.
I cannot keep up with the youth of to-
day! But it is fun to try.
