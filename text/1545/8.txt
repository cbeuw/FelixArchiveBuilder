An article on sex, so who else

Sex : a direct approach
Whether you’re in a committed relationship or having a one night
stand, you shouldn’t be too afraid to ask for what you want
an I come on your
tits?” – I thought this
was a somewhat for-
ward request for our
ﬁrst night together but
personally I’m quite sexually liberated
and as a result didn’t think much to it.
Well not until later when he asked to
come on my face. Don’t get me wrong
It’s not that I have anything against
experimental ejaculation per se, hell
I think it’s kind of hot. However, it
did strike me as pretty unorthodox
coming from someone I’d only met a
couple of times. What if I’d been a de-
mure, reserved kind of girl, who only
enjoyed missionary and spooning?
And whilst I think it’s fair to assume
that I don’t exactly exude timid wall-
ﬂower, the question remains: what
made this guy think it was okay to
make such a request?
Fast forward a couple of weeks later,
I met up with a guy from my past – I
wasn’t sure what to expect; there had
always been ﬂirtation between us but
it had never led anywhere. However,
plied with wine and nostalgia and
having missed the last tube home,
we both knew what was going to go
down. The sex itself was a combina-
tion of the non-committalness of a
one night stand with comforting fa-
miliarity of long standing aﬀection –
It wasn’t mind blowing but pleasant
enough all the same. From a purely
clinical standpoint, it was a pretty
standard shag, no crazy karma-sutra
C
inspired moves or kinky add-ons but
again as he reached climax the same
request was made!
Now the object of this article is not
to describe the pros and cons of cum-
ming-on-tits. Whilst I realise some
women (maybe even most women)
would consider an act of this nature
degrading or humiliating, I liked it.
The bottom line is I loved the fact they
both had the balls to ask for what they
wanted, it was a massive turn on. And
this lead me to thinking, generally,
why aren’t we more vocal about our
sexual desires?
Come on ladies, let’s be honest
we’ve all faked an orgasm or at the
very least feigned more enthusiasm
than we felt. Personally, I don’t have
enough digits to count the number of
times I thought to myself – ‘I wish he
would just...’ but then decided to bite
my tongue. The worst has to be when
you’re faced with inevitable post-coi-
tal ‘was that good for you?’ – How do
you break it to someone that no, three
minutes of missionary did not rock
your world?
Sex (or at least good sex) tends to
fall into two categories; emotional sex
and hedonistic sex. Emotional sex is
when the act is underpinned by emo-
tional attachment – what some people
chose to call making love (vom). Con-
versely, hedonistic sex is sex for sex’s
sake and is largely conﬁned to physical
gratiﬁcation and immediate sensory
pleasures.
However in both cases it seems ab-
surd not to be direct about what you
enjoy. If it’s emotional sex, you should
feel close enough to the person to be
candid about your sexual desires. If it’s
hedonistic sex, ultimately you should
both be out to maximise pleasure and
as a result be equally vocal. So why is
it that so many of us feel too ashamed
or shy to ask for what we want?
In light of these recent musings, I’ve
pledged to be transparent about my
sexual likes and dislikes. I now make a
point of asking what my partner likes
and then make some suggestions as to
what might enjoy. So far this approach
yielded highly satisfying results. Like
so many things in life, it seems sex is
very much a matter of ‘if you don’t ask
you don’t get’
Having said that, maybe it’s just
something about the way I act that
makes guys think I want them to jizz
all over me. Not sure.

My favourite things about exams
“
Anonymous
t’s that time of year again:
with the joy of the excessive
chocolate consumption that is
Easter comes The Fear. Exams
are just round the corner and
you suddenly realise you haven’t been
to an entire week of lectures since Oc-
tober.
However, I was once told that every
cloud has a silver lining. And here is
that lining for exam season:
1) Money Saving Opportunity: I
mean, between the days you spend
forming an intense relationship with
the view of Queen’s Tower from the
4th ﬂoor of Central Library and the
nights having panic-attacks and con-
tests with your ﬂatmates about who’s
done the least work, when do you
physically have any time to spend
I
money? You’ll only spend money on
comfort food from the Library café
and unnecessary stationary from the
Union Shop, and in no time you’ll re-
sent both of those places so much you
won’t be able to pull your money from
your pocket (because your ﬁsts are
clenched with revision rage).
2) Reduction of Embarrassing En-
counters: During exams, alcohol
consumption either plummets or es-
calates. If it plummets, I ﬁnd myself
exponentially less likely to wake up
beside someone and having to sheep-
ishly smile whilst I gather my cloth-
ing and mutter something about how
*cough* great a time I had. And if it
escalates, well, the revision-induced
misery means I’ll be a guilt-ridden,
crying wreck by half past ten and
that’s never attractive. No one wants
to go home with that person, so job
done: I will wake up in my own bed,
similarly sheepish as I recall my break-
down but free to enjoy the embarrass-
ment alone.
3) New Hobbies and Discoveries:
Since the dawn of education, one of
the best things about revision are the
new things you end up discovering
whilst you frantically procrastinate
and avoid the stacks of notes in front
of you (your very own mini-Everest,
courtesy of our darling Imperial).
These things range from your new se-
cret talent, or simply a fantastic inter-
net-revelation. For instance, yesterday
I spent an hour and a half with my ﬂu-
id mechanics open in front of me but
watching a documentary on Beyonce
– it was the best hour and half of my
life. I also caught three M&Ms and
one Malteser in my mouth by throw-
ing them in the air – this is unprec-
edented and all thanks to my exams.
So whether you discover Maru the Cat
on YouTube, create a Twitter account
or simply ﬁnd that you can cross all
of your ﬁngers and toes at once, don’t
forget: none of this would have been
made possible without serious denial.
THANK YOU EXAMS.
