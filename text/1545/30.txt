The Imperial College Bridge society
was shut down a several years ago
but after some convincing the Impe-
rial College Union decided to give us
another shot and the Imperial Col-
lege Bridge club was up and running
again in 2010. Our sport once again
had a dedicated club at our university
(and yes, it is a sport according to the
IOC!).
With a very good turnout at Fresh-
er’s Fair and our ﬁrst session of term,
we were eager to prove ourselves
as we entered in the Portland Bowl
(British University Championship)
in 2010. We managed to reach the
ﬁnals that year, which we lost to Ox-
ford. Despite the loss we were all very
happy to have made it to the ﬁnals,
something which no Imperial team
had done so far since the tournament
started in the 1980s.
This year we entered the Portland
Bowl again for the 2012-2013 sea-
son and immediately drew a strong
Cambridge B team for the knock-out
qualifying rounds. We managed to
beat them by a small margin only to
ﬁnd out our next round opponents
were Oxford A, who kicked us out of
the tournament last time! This was a
bit of a grudge match but also a very
important one, the winner would ad-
vance to the Top 4 and a chance to
play at the famous Portland Club in
Brook Street. Our team played sol-
idly and pulled oﬀ a convincing win
against Oxford!
Last Saturday we headed to the
Portland Club for our semi-ﬁnals
match against Cambridge, which has
won the Portland Bowl more than
any other team. It was a slugfest the
entire day with points going back and
forth but the overall scores remaining
very close. At the end of it we were
ahead by 4 IMPs (with over 100 IMPs
having been exchanged). But this
score was still subject to change as
Cambridge had appealed two tour-
nament director rulings which were
still being processed. If Cambridge
won both those of those appeals
then it would be a tie, meaning we
would have to play another 6 boards
for the tiebreaker. Fortunately for us
they lost both appeals and we could
get some rest before the ﬁnals on the
next day.
On the day of the ﬁnals we were
playing very strong Edinburgh team
with players from the Scottish Open
and Womens team. They had beaten
LSE in the other semi-ﬁnal by quite
a large margin, so this was deﬁnitely
not going to be an easy match for us
to win. Interestingly, neither Edin-
burgh or Imperial College had ever
won the ﬁnals of the Portland Bowl
since it started in 1984 so either way
this year’s winners would be writing
history.
We were trailing for more than half
of the match and at the end of the 4th
set we were behind 15 IMPs. While
this was not an insurmountable lead,
we were running out of time with
only 2 sets to go and needed some-
thing good to happen. That is exactly
what happened when we had a mon-
ster of a 5th set and went from 15
IMPs behind to a 29 IMP lead going
into the last round. Edinburgh man-
aged to cut down on our lead by quite
a bit but not enough, the ﬁnal score
being 126-118 in favour of Imperial
College!
As the plane door opened, the cold
French, garlic and baguette ridden air
hit us. We knew the challenge, to go
to the French engineering university
championships and beat them at their
own sport, handball.
We brought with us four sides, two
men’s and two women’s, all with high
expectations. The men were defend-
ing champions and the women had
a very strong squad. Upon arrival we
received typical French hospitality as
we were shown to our accommoda-
tion. It was minus seven, and we were
to stay in tents. The next morning the
inside of all the tents were frozen and
we were more than a little chilly.
All four of the teams progressed
smoothly through the morning’s
group stages, posting some impressive
results, with both men’s sides topping
their groups, and both women’s quali-
fying for the quarter-ﬁnals.
Here the men’s run came to an
end. The seconds were drawn against
last years defeated ﬁnalists Central
Paris, and the ﬁrsts against the even-
tual champions, Central Lyon. De-
spite courageous eﬀorts, both were
knocked out.
The women however fared much
better. The second team faced Central
Lille and advanced comfortably 11-8.
They were to then play the winners
of Imperial 1st against Central Lyon
Alumni. It was a truly nail-biting en-
counter with team captain Rebecca
Pﬁstner providing a commanding per-
formance. The match ended 6 apiece
after extra-time, leading to the dread-
ed penalty shoot-out. Red Elmahdi
was heroic in goal, saving 3 of 4 penal-
ties and helping to ensure safe passage
to the all Imperial semi-ﬁnal.
Both Women’s sides were particu-
larly strong this year and there wasn’t
much to pick between them. It was a
terriﬁc encounter and was desperately
close. The second team scored in the
dying moments to seal a memorable
10-9 victory and receive a place in the
ﬁnal. The ﬁrst’s won their third place
play-oﬀ to ensure Imperial would have
two teams on the podium, but the ﬁ-
nal was left to the next morning to de-
cide the champion.
The girls met Central Lyon in the ﬁ-
nal. The ﬁrst half was a tense aﬀair and
the game was locked at 6-6 at the in-
terval. However in the second half the
women produced a truly dominating
performance to win the match 13-10
and so claimed the trophy.
The weekend was a great success for
Imperial and capped oﬀ a successful
year for the club. At least one team has
been on the podium at all three diﬀer-
ent competitions we entered this year
and we are looking forward to the next
tournament in Lille in April.
