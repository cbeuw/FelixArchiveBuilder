During the Easter break Imperial came
under national scrutiny after a seven
month undercover investigation by
the British Union for the Abolition of
Vivisection (BUAV) alleges that there
is a poor standard of professional con-
duct by Imperial scientists. Researchers
from Imperial, one of the signatories of
the Declaration of Openness on Ani-
mal Research, were apparently ﬁlmed
experimenting on animals in a way
that the BUAV claim are inhumane;
this includes operating on animals that
the BUAV say were improperly anaes-
thetised and culling animals that were
not needed by researchers. The BUAV
sent an undercover veterinary nurse to
Imperial, who over the course of her
stay alleges that some researchers not
only showed callous disregard for the
animals under their care but she also
claims that others acknowledged that
they were untrained and some

Departmental Cocktail Parties being
held on campus may have to change
their format from now on. This
emerges after the Chemistry Cocktail
Party, which is due to be held near the
end of this academic year, has been
forced to have a format change due to
licensing laws and incidents at previ-
ous parties from other Departments
on campus.
The party was originally planned
to be held in the Chemistry Café, as
it was last year, with students from
ChemSoc making the drinks and giv-
ing them out. Before, a ticket would
get the attendee as much alcohol as
they wanted, until it ran out.
However, due to licensing laws, it
could not exist in its current format.

Imperial College Health Centre will
no longer be letting postgraduate
students use their services if they live
outside of the registration area. Im-
perial College Union informed the
postgraduate students of the change
via email, which prompted over 200
replies mostly stating anger and upset
at the situation.
The Health Care Centre communi-
cated the change on their website with
a note, as well as signs on the door of
the Health Centre itself. The reason
given in the statement read as fol-
lows: “Unfortunately there is no NHS
funding for such students and in the
past the funding came from Imperial
College. However this year there is
a shortfall in this funding, which the
College has advised us it is unable to
make up”. There is some confusion as
the Dean of Students told Becky Lane,
Deputy President (Welfare), that the
College didn’t decrease but actually
slightly increased the funding from
last year. However, the reduced funds
were actually due to a decrease in the
number of students who registered.
Despite this decision the Health
Centre still allows both undergradu-
ate and postgraduate students from
the Royal College of Music to use it
regardless of where they live.
For now, postgrads must register
with their local GPs for health care.
There have even been reports of peo-
ple being turned away at the Health
Care Centre as they are no longer able
to use the services.
If a student lives within a list of 20
post codes they are allowed to regis-
ter for the Health Centre. The Health
Centre previously agreed to >>4
