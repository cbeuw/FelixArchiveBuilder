Whichever way you look at it, teaching has more to offer.
Exciting developments throughout education are adding an extra dimension
to teaching. In addition to the variety, early responsibility and challenges you'd
expect, there are now opportunities to play an important role in management and
planning.
Of course, some things never change. Take, for example, the pride you'll feel
in your students' achievements - success that will always be partly your own.
There can be few better definitions of "job satisfaction".
Whatever your starting point, you can find
out more including routes into teaching, pay
and grants for training (including the special

year courses) by clipping the coupon below.
