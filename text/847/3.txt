Dance Umbrella '89 by MAC
So what is it? You think it's too expensive? A little
twee? Too highbrow? Or, you have problems
deciphering the streets of the big bad metropolis and
you wouldn't know where to find a venue? I mean
why is it that people like you perpetuate the myth that
dance must be some sort of fringe interest and
strengthen the philistines case for cutting funding
even closer to the bone? I ask this because I already
know that if you took the trouble to see the right show
you'd discover that dance is none of those things and
it is in fact the plug to fill that gap in the entertainment
you already see. I ask because I know that there are
those of you out there, like the Wing Chun Club for
instance who already appreciate the beauty and
strength of disciplined movement (albeit for different
aims) and who would tune in readily to the visual feast
of athletic artists at work. I ask this because I know
that the students at this College have an energy and
a drive that can take in a tremendous breadth of
pursuits to balance the demanding depth of
commitment that the institution will ask of you. But
the small matter of life beyond your studies is asking
something of you as well. So if you concur with the
Rector's speech in which he expresses his touching
paternal concern for your ability to manage your
affairs with any competence without detriment to
your studies (too many living examples of capable
management have blown that argument for me) then
stop here because despite the waffle this piece has
fuck all to do with the written word but is about
The Cholmondeleys (prounounced Chumlees)

The Cholmondeleys' other halves
something that's happening out there in the big wide
world. So let's take a look through the Round
Window.
Dance Umbrella '89 is the eleventh of these annual
dance festivals which offer over a concentrated
season the chance to sample some of the best of
international dance. The breadth of choice offers an
unmissable opportunity to discover ones tastes from
a varied menu of French sensuality, English wit and
American pioneering. Performances are scheduled at
five well known and accessible London venues over
a six week period which started on October 4 and
ends on November 18. Concessionary tickets average
out about £5.
The shows tend to be shorter than theatrical events
and so there is usually a comfortable time after the
performance in which to relax, drink or even go for
a bite to eat if you're a little more organised: perfect
then for group outings as well as just taking a friend.
The festival calendar is given below as well as brief
previews of some of the shows: short of picking you
up and carrying you that's as much as I can do.
There has been a strong French flavour to this year's
Umbrella due to the flourishing artistic culture and
generous government grants enjoyed across the
Channel.
Roc in Lichen's recent performance at Riverside
was a welcome reminder of the boundless innovation
of theFrench as the trio combined rock climbing and
dance with the playful and inventive recklessness of
children. Anjelin Preljocaj now promises to display
at the same venue that other most French of French
traits sensuality in a 'voyage of pshycho sexual
discov""' Liqueurs de Chairs which loses a little in
translation to Carnal Cocktails.
The last of the continental visitors the much
acclaimed Studio DM will be weaving there 'dream
like' spell Fragment at the place in November.
Continuing the who's who of dance some of the
best of British companies are under the Umbrella this
year. The much recommended Cholmondeleys will
premiere their latest work choreographed by Lea
Anderson for an ensemble of eight women at The
Place.
Extemporary Dance Theatre's Up to Something
looks like an interesting mix of a show with three
separate parts from four of Britain's boldest
choreographers.
Second Stride are presenting a radical rework
of the traditional Coppelia story Heaven Ablaze in H,,
Breast and the Siobhan Davies Company wn
feature two new works: one created to live music
commissioned from Andrew Poppy and the second
performed to Kevin Volan's Cover Him With Grass 'he
composer's evocation of African Landscape.
From the reputable to the distinguished Merce
Cunningham the American septagenarian credited by
those who should know with a seminal influence in
the evolution of modern dance will be presenting a
two week season at Sadler's Wells. The programme
includes several British premieres as well as the
popular piece Pictures and also Rainforest which
apparently features inflatable silver clouds courtesy
of Andy Warhol (but never mind).
The platform performances, this year entitled
British Independents for Bagnolet, give a chance
for new work to be aired and in the case judge by the
beady eyes of those selecting for the coveted Grand
Prix de Bagnolet.
So stick in a pin or pick out a date but for God's
sake don't be a couch potato and go.
