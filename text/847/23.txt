Muscle Shoal in the Union Lounge last
Tonight, Ents present Big Boy Tomato in the Lounge.
A good laugh band, regulars on the London circuit,
certain to get your toes-a-tapping. They're good
enough to splurge on your chips. So stop playing
D + D, don you whitest trainers and most stone-
washed jeans (fashion kings) and hit the Union. Goth's
also allowed in.
Doors open at 9pm and there is a bar extension until
1 am and a disco until 2am. Tickets are £2 in advance
from Union Office or your friendly ents people, £2.50
on the door and £1 to all you lucky Ents card holders.
Halloween is also a good time to party and what
an event we have got lined up for you. There is a joint
party with the American Institute of Foreign Study
(AIFS) in the Ents Lounge until 1am. 31st October is
the date and the entertainment includes Rag
Cocktails, bar extension and fancy dress (optional),
and it will only cost you a single coin (£1).
Next Friday has a bit of a scoop for you. The band
is called Bliss, they are moderately famous and are on
the brink of hitting the big time. Make sure you get
to see them before they make become megastars.
Details to follow in next week's FELIX.
BJ, Ents Chairman and
Mike Dalton, Cuddly Person.
