HE'S 54, HE MANAGES 4000 PEOPLE,
AND HE'S BEEN IN HIS INDUSTRY FOR 25 YEARS.
HOW A R E Y O U GOING TO TELL HIM
TO SPEND £5 MILLION?
You're in a meeting with your manager
and the Managing Director of your
client. They're a £300m company plan-
ning expansion into Europe. The MD
turns to your manager.
"If France is so attractive, why have all
our competitors done so badly there?"
Your manager turns to you. You're the
one who's spent the last three weeks
analysing the French market (you were
in Paris interviewing last week).
Your answer is concise, if a little nerv-
ous, and two heads nod in agreement.
One month later, convinced by the
quality of the analysis, the client board
votes to build the plant you recom-
mended.
It's a typical result. As the largest stra-
tegic management consultancy in the
UK, Bain & Company's task is to help
clients produce superior performance
in every aspect of their business.
As anAssociate Consultant at Bain you
are an essential part of that process.
The situation we've described is one
you'll learn to take in your stride. The
job demands maturity, problem solving
ability, commitment and resourceful-
ness. To those qualities we'll add a
rigorous training that will equip you to
deal with complex business problems.
You'll work with like-minded people
who'll rely on your contribution almost
from the word go.
If that's the kind of challenge that ap-
peals to you, come to our presentation
and cocktail reception at The Portman
Hotel, Portman Square, London W l ,
on Thursday 9 November 1989 at
7.00pm, or contact Gillian Jones,
