IC LEAD EXPEDITION TO THE SOLOMAN ISLANDS
i Next Sunday, 7:15 World About Us BBC2
The ideas behind this project were hatched in mid
1978 and shortly after the group was formed.
After much thought the basic aims were set out:
to travel to the Solomon Islands and document, in
• one particular area, the construction methods for
the almost ubiquitous dugout canoe, and to try
and find and record the construction details and
legends behind the much rarer and larger war
canoes, ' t o m o k o s ' , previously used for
headhunting.
The feasibility of the project soon became
a p p a r e n t . T r a v e l is none too c h e a p and
philanthropists with money to spare were few
and far between. So, typewriters were dusted
off and the two-fingered race for sponsorship
began. Regular meetings between L o n d o n ,
Oxford, Sidmouth, Brighton and Cambridge
produced much by the way of equipment lists,
a lot of which was already being collected, but
little of the vital cash, and as we had calculated
on a budget of £6,000 things began to get a
little disturbing.
Our luck changed when we acquired the
approval and support of the Imperial College
Exploration Board. Other organisations then
f o l l o w e d w i t h their s u p p o r t or at least
showing some interest. We were then fortunate
enough to receive one of the M i c k B u r k e
awards, six were given out of 400 applicants,
but our troubles were not over. The point of
no return came in March 1979 when, in order
to qualify for the cheapest air fares possible
tickets had to be purchased. By this time we
had raised enough to buy the tickets but with
little to spare. However, we took the plunge
knowing that if it transpired that we couldn't
d e p a r t in J u n e due to lack of funds, we
wouldn't get anything back on the rickets!
Having begged and borrowed the necessary
remaining cash, thrown out all but the bear
m i n i u m u m of c l o t h i n g f r o m o u r p a c k s ,
completed the customs formalities for all our
rather heavy camera gear, we finally set off for
the Pacific.
We were still apprehensive when we reached
the capital H o n i a r a , as we hadn't got the
required government research permit, due to
bureaucratic delays on their part, and thus
could have been refused entry, but we passed
through customs unscathed and were welcomed
by someone unknown to any of us. It
was pure luck that anyone met us at all; a
letter to our initial contact, who was then on
leave, had been intercepted by this person. We
were very grateful for the ride into town and
for the initial help we were given. Luckily, we
sorted out most things and obtained our official
documents in the following few days.
We left the mission hostel where we stayed
for a week and joined the colourful, noisy, and
cheerful throng of islanders who travelled with
us up to the W e s t e r n P r o v i n c e . A n old
battered boat, bought from the Japenese
complete with permanent list, served as our
means of transport. During our twenty-four
hour journey we went through our first Pacific
storm in which we got a little wet. Turns were
t a k e n to sleep in the c a b i n that we had
obtained primarily to store our equipment, and
there we discovered the delights of having
coachroaches crawl over your legs and face
just as you doze off. The place was infested.
Those of us who stayed there for more than
half an hour had to sleep with the light on.
We finally arrived in Munda one of the larger
settlements in the area, which, as well as having
a jetty, boasts a one mile airstrip built by
Americans during the war. Here we established
our base with the help of contacts in the
forestry department.
Our two female members of the expedition
claimed their first accidents within four days of
our arrival. One, while testing the cool lagoon
waters, swam through a sea urchin colony,
which left her with about forty spine tips in her
right hand and wrist. The other developed a
serious allergic reaction against tuna fish,
which at that time we were eating a lot.
Having recovered from these two setbacks,
we q u i c k l y a c c l i m a t i s e d to the heat and
humidity as we walked to the surrounding
villages to speak to the elders and anyone else
w h o h a d a n y k n o w l e d g e of c a n o e s a n d
associated custom stories, and in some cases
we spoke to old men who had actually taken
part in headhunting raids, the last of which
was about 1910. We mostly spoke in Pidgin
English, which we picked up fairly rapidly.and
used i n t e r p r e t e r s from the villages when
necessary. As we talked, so the stories and
legends built around tomokos were divulged to
us, our information on construction techniques
grew and our list of possible contacts in other
villages expanded.
T o reach the futher places, long and often
hazardous trips were made in large dugouts
fitted with outboard motors. Constantly aware
of the shark infested waters of the Pacific, we
were driven by skillful islanders who knew the
seas well, which often threatened to swamp the
dugouts. O n one such journey we had to turn
back having already travelled forty-five minutes
because of heavy seas. O n reaching the village
we obtained another slightly larger canoe and
set out again. By this time it was late in the
evening, but we had to press on and navigate
by moonlight in very heavy swell as we took
with us a young boy who earlier had a fish
hook cut his eye open, and we were heading in
the direction of the nearest dressing station.
Sadly, in such a place little can be done for this
type of accident. Although we reached the
station, we discovered later that he didn't
reach proper medical aid until four days later,
far too late to save his eye.
We would spend up to one week in any one
village and return to our 'base' every two or
three weeks. We often split up and went off in
two g r o u p s v a r y i n g the c o m b i n a t i o n of
expedition members each time. O n arrival at a
village we explained our purpose in Pidgin and
were almost always given accommodation in
one of the village huts. We tried, successfully,
to become part of the village in which we
stayed, instead of being just of novelty value to
the islanders, by living with families and eating
their staple foods of cabbage, sweet potato,
yam and taro which they delighted in showing
us how to prepare. We also attended their
feasts, a wedding, a baptism and were shown
the construction of a bamboo band.
Life wasn't all roses; sanitation was often a
problem . . . especially always followed us
around and we were mercilessly bitten by
sandflies, mosquitoes and in some areas bed
bugs, the bites of which went septic very fast,
as did any form of wound.
Slowly we added to our record of both the
dugouts and tomokos meeting in our tracks
one of the last men able to build a war canoe.
Altogether we met with great success and it
was with some sadness that we waited for the
b o a t to r e t u r n to H a n i a r a a n d t h e n c e
homewards.
