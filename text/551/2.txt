A L B U M REVIEWS
PAUL COLLINS' BEAT - Paul
Collins' Beat
The group used to be called T h e Beat,
but they have changed their name to Paul
Collins' Beat to avoid confusion with The
Beat (of Tears Of A Clown fame).
O f the t w e l v e s o n g s o n the r e c o r d ,
none really stands out above any of the
others, although none of them provoke
t h o u g h t s s u c h as " W h a t a l o a d of
rubbish". The music itself is fairly good
from the point of view of musicianship
and melodicism, but at the same time is
predictable, boring and flat. W h e n I say it
is predictable, boring and flat, I mean it is
just like all of the other Elvis Costello/Joe
J a c k s o n rip-offs that the whole world and
his dog seem to be doing recently. In fact,
tnat is the best description of the band —
tney are in the Costello/Jackson mould,
with the same sort of songs (about girls,
work, Rock'n'Roll (Maan), girls, etc). T h e
trouble, however, is that they have none
of the originality or visual impact of their
peers.
A n objective critique of the album; the
songs are well written and well played and
the band perform well within the limitations
of ' R o c k and Roll'. Subjective critique: the
s o n g s a r e w r i t t e n a b o u t the s a m e o l d
subjects, ie, girls, rock 'mythology', etc. The
band play well, but threaten nothing and
appear to lack a certain 'something'. Paul
Collins' Beat are probably lauded as ' N e w
W a v e ' in the U S A , which they are — with
respect to the Eagles.
T o s u m up: this is a mildly pleasant, easy
iistening album which is a little like aural
wallpaper. N o n e of the songs are mentioned
by name, due to their anonymity.
HYPNOTISED - The Undertones
The return of the Undertones with their
second eagerly awaited (by me and J o h n
Peel, at least) second album. It's good to
report that this album is as good as their
bebut last year. Since the release of the
classic Teenage Kicks E P in autumn 1978,
the Undertones have hardly put a foot
wrong.
There are fifteen songs on the album,
all of which deserve the bored teenager
seal of approval. Particularly outstanding
are Hard Luck, Hypnotised, Whizz Kids,
Under The Broadwalk, Tearproof,
What's With Terry and last, but almost
first, Wednesday Week, the single My
Perfect Cousin is a l s o i n c l u d e d . T h e
songs all deal with the joys and pain of
teenage life: girls, insecurity, friends, etc.
Feargal Sharkey's vocals are a well nigh
Derfect foil to the rest of the band, the
slight quaver in his voice gives an added
dimension to the meaning of the songs.
T h e f i r s t t r a c k , More Songs About
Chocolate And Girls is in many ways the
BABY'S GOT A GUN - The Only
Ones
The O n l y O n e s are destined to be one of
those really great bands that never attain
s u c c e s s o n a large s c a l e . T h e y have
already reached cult status with a small
m i n o r i t y of r o c k w o r s h i p p e r s , as their
a b i l i t y to p a c k o u t the L y c e u m w i t h
d e v o u t a n d e n t h u s i a s t i c f o l l o w e r s has
shown.
W i t h Baby's Got A Gun, their third
album to date, they remain as inaccessible
to t h e h u g e a u d i e n c e of p o p r a d i o
stations as they did at the beginning of
their career. Their music is such that it
needs to be heard several times before it
hooks, and their is no single that can be
t a k e n f r o m t h e a l b u m w h i c h w o u l d
receive enough airplay to really catch-on;
the best hope would be "Why Don't You
Kill Yourself?", w h i c h just might ignite
some spark of curiosity in a slumbering
D J who needs to fill an awkward two and
a half minute gap in his programme.
Perret's voice is as hypnotic as ever, a
s t r a n g e b u t s e d u c t i v e q u a l i t y f r o m a
larynx that does its best to imitate the
quality of sound emitted from a concrete
m i x e r , but b a c k e d by a b a n d w i t h as
much experience behind them as musical
m u s c l e , the v o i c e b l e n d s in w i t h the
overall sound and becomes as m u c h a_
part of the O n l y O n e s as the distinctive
structure of the songs. The album does
not have quite the same exicitement as
their last l o n g p l a y e r , Even Serpents
Shine, but this is made up for by the
extra polish that has gone into the latest
disc, but as Serpents must have been one
of the best albums to be released last
year it would be difficult to better.
T h e r e is s o m e t h i n g quite i r r e s i s t i b l e
about the pull that the highly original style
of music can exert on the listener, the
melodies are so seductive that it would be
easy to forget the p o w e r b e h i n d the
songs, laid down by Alan Mair, on bass,
a n d M i k e K e l l y ( e x - S p o o k y T o o t h ) o n
drums so strongly and efficiently that the
rhythm and lead guitar work are just icing
6 n the cake.
T w o t r a c k s a r e o u t s t a n d i n g , b o t h
appear on the first side. Why Don't You
Kill Yourself? is particularly noteworthy,
both for its immediate, effective and very
strong melody, and the vicious, but witty
lyrics that help draw attention to a very
strong song, if there is another single on
the album it is this one. The other track
worthy of particular mention is Deadly
Nightshade, which manages to produce a
great feeling of melancholy and depression
whilst gently rocking the listener. B o t h these
songs, like the whole album can stand the
test of repeated playing, without saturating,
and when the volume is turned up the
band really show their muscle.
W h e n it comes down to it, you may as well
s t o p P r e t e n d i n g , forget a b o u t G e t t i n g
Happy, this is the best album to emerge so
far this decade.
SHAKIN' STREET -Shakin' Street
Shakin' Street's second album and I'd like
to start off with a m o a n . Y e t a n o t h e r
band appear to depend on a female singer
to sell t h e i r r e c o r d s ; F a b i e n n e S h i n e
a p p e a r s all c l a d in l e a t h e r , inviting all
s o r t s of S a n d M f a n t a s i e s . G r o u p s
should sell records on the contents of the
music not the contents of their singer's
b r a . W h o w o u l d g i v e B l o n d i e h o u s e
room, were it not for M s Harry's pretty
face?
The record, however, is not what I had
f e a r e d , in fact it is r e a s o n a b l y g o o d .
Produced by Sandy Pearlman of Clash
and Blue Oyster Cult fame, the record
o w e s s o m e of i t s p u n k y s o u n d t o
P e a r l m a n ' s e x p e r i e n c e w i t h the C l a s h .
Ross the Boss (Dictator's guitarist) plays
on the album as lead guitarist.
O n the first side No Compromise, Solid
As A Rock and No Time To Loose stand
out, by nature of thier speed and attack
although the stupid applause and cheering
mixed in ont he beginning and various
stages of Solid As A Rock are irritating.
O n the other side Generation X and So
Fine are quite good. The songs themselves
d e a l w i t h the e v e r p o p u l a r t h e m e s of
r e v o l u t i o n , a u t h o r i t y , w i l d y o u t h , e t c ;
another album to drive your parent crazy
(sic). Fabienne Shine's voice isn't ouite in
the S i o u x s i e S u e c l a s s , but c o m p a r e s
favourably with the Nolans.
T h e group still have m u c h to do before
they b e c o m e m e m o r a b l e . In Zigzag of
S e p t 1977, T o n y P a r s o n s s a i d , i n his
r e v i e w of the M o n t de M a r s a n p u n k
festival: and the crew with the
m o n e y t h i g h e d s i n g e r , S h a k i n ' S t r e e t ,
c h u r n o u t a k i n d of P u n k H i t P a r a d e
Pastiche that bores me shitless." Well,
they've improved on that,
best, acting as an introduction to the rest
of the s o n g s , a d v i s i n g y o u to " S e t t l e
down, cancel all engagements" to listen to
" T e e n a g e D r e a m s t h a t a r e w o r t h a
m e n t i o n " a n d " D u m b e n t e r t a i n m e n t " .
G r e a t . H o w is i t , t h o u g h , t h a t t h e
Undertones, with all their songs about
teenage'kicks, etc, succeed where many
other bands fail? F o r me, the answer is
their almost painful normality; they look
like people that you see out in the real
world, and they c o m e out and say what
they mean directly, rather than coming
over all mystic and serious (and boring)
— they're a fun band.
A l o n g with the Ramones, the Specials,
the Jame, Burning Spear, Selectors and
Linton K w e s i Johnson, the Undertones
are one of the few groups /individuals I
trust. This record is great. Search and
enjoy.
