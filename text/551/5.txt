W h e n you buy a jar of instant coffee only
about 37% of what you pay will get back
to the c o u n t r y f r o m w h i c h the coffee
beans came. A b o u t 10% will go to the
retailer, and the rest will go to Nestles,
General Foods or B r o o k e - B o n d Liebig, if
you buy a 'brand name', or to Solcafe (J
L y o n s & C o ) or T e n c o L t d ( C o c a - C o l a
Ltd) if you buy a supermarket 'own label'.

makes up over a quarter of the export
earnings of eleven out of fifty producing
countries — all third world. In Burundi, it
accounted for 83% of export earnings for
1972-77.
In 1963, soon after independence, the
new Tanganyikan government decided,
in conjunction with their policy of self-
reliance to process the coffee itself, since
this is where the main profits lie.
B u t they have h a d m a n y m a r k e t i n g
p r o b l e m s (due to n o s m a l l d e g r e e by
Nestles 'assistance') and until recently,
Tanzanian instant coffee has only been
marketed in Zambia, K e n y a and Tanzania
itself as 'Africafe'.
It is n o w a v a i l a b l e i n B r i t a i n a s
'Campaign Coffee' and there will be a stall

TRAVEL
TRIP-UPS
AND HOW T O
AVOID THEM
This month's edition of National Student
(the N U S newspaper) contains an eight
page travel supplement, concentrating
mainly on the pitfalls of cheap flights to
E u r o p e a n d e s t i n a t i o n s , p a r t i c u l a r l y
Greece. Prices quoted are often for off-
peak season travel only, and an example
is g i v e n of a r e t u r n flight to A t h e n s
a d v e r t i s e d at £119, but w h i c h d i d not
include U K or G r e e k airport taxes or fuel
surcharges, increasing the real cost of the
flight to £148.50.
St Seal T r a v e l * offer flights to a wide
variety of European destinations at highly
c o m p e t i t i v e p r i c e s (eg, p e a k A t h e n s
return £124).
U S I T * deal with student charter flights
(eg, Athens return in July £109), but to be
eligible you must have a valid International
Student Identity C a r d and be aged between
sixteen and thirty.

the National Student article recommends
the B S T * products; however, these are

In general, the advice given to people
wanting to book a flight abroad is simple
— always read the small print (especially
w i t h r e g a r d to s u r c h a r g e s ) a n d b o o k
through your local student travel office —
it's their job to give you the best deal
available.

Being all out within approximately an
hour and a half, for 51, our confidence was
further boosted by the promise of marmite
and cucumber sandwiches for tea.
This inspired, R a t m a n and S e n bowled
some spirited rubbish and Balliol were soon
52 for 1.

match arranged. The teams reversed their
batting orders, and everyone was to bowl.
