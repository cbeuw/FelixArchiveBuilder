TRAM o
forthe best deal going
In association with British Rail and Sealink
at L S T Office, Walkway, Sherfield Building
— Leeds l o a n —
Leeds Poly has borrowed
£140,000 from Samuel Smiths
Brewery to buy a hotel in the
Lake District.
Students must sell 7,200 pints
(exclusively) of Sam Smiths a
week. The students will own the
Wharton Grange Hotel in
C a r n f o r t h by 1990. T h e
brewery, in return for the selling
of their ale say that 10 per cent of
the loan will be deemed repaid
each year.
The Union President Stevan
Mrvos defended the union's
decision as an attempt to
translate their liquid assets into a
fixed investment at a time when
student union financing is under
attack by the Government.
Grants
Invaders
The main rates of grant for
students living in Hall or lodgings
have been increased by 14% to
£1,695. For students living in the
parental home the new grant is
£1,125.
The total cost of mandatory
grants in Britain next year will be
around £400 million. The total
number of students receiving
them will be about 355,000.
— Housing bill —
Local authorities will be able to
evict students at a days notice
when the new Housing Bill
becomes law in June this year.
A special clause excludes
students from security of tenure
in council or housing association
accommodation.
Bang
The magazine Safety News
states that an incorrectly fitted
battery in your calculator could
cause a dangerous explosion.
A university employee who
placed an HP7 battery in a
calculator back to front caused a
violent explosion in which pieces
of the battery travelled over 20
feet.
Fortunately no-one was
injured. Safety News explained
that the three other batteries in
the calculator were charging the
misplaced one, causing it to emit
hydrogen gas which could not
escape except by explosion.
Similar accidents could occur
with any piece of equipment if
people did not read the
instructions properly.
An Oxford University student
has criticised his friends for using
'systems' on space invaders.
The top scores obtained at
Oxford are just over 29,000
(obtained without using a
system).
An example of a system is
where the player leaves four
vertical columns intact at one
side, and a sole invader on the
seventh column from that side,
top row.
He then stays in the gap
between the block and the sole
invader, knocking out each
horizontal row when it reaches
the bottom, 'safe' level.
Getting rid of them this way is
fairly easy, interminably boring
and not really in the spirit of the
game.

Recent votes on the N U S have
shown that large numhers of
colleges do not wish to disaffiliate
from the National Union of
Students.
The two large colleges voting
to quit N U S were King's College,
London and Dundee University.
Harper Adams Agricultural
College Wolverhampton also
voted to leave.
Reading have now returned
after a U G M voted by 435 to 26
to rejoin.
Nottingham stayed in by 1,888

stay in and the following colleges
also remained in:

S o u t h a m p t o n 500 to 15,
University College London 1,100
to 600, St Georges Medical

A n attempt to have a

term when the E G M ended
prematurely due to inquoracy.
May 14
The N U S have warned that
trade union action against
governemnt economic policies
could cause 'considerable' chaos

14, designed to show the breadth
of popular opposition to
government policies.
