If you have just had your
insurance renewal notice, you will
have seen how the cost of motor
insurance has gone up. For example,
a £50 premium in 1974 would
probably be £100 today, especially
if you have stayed with just one
company over this period.
But there's no reason why you
should stay with the same
insurance company, and in times
like these it makes much more
sense to shop around each year.
Many motorists already do,
because recent legislation means
that there is now no risk
involved - yet quotations from
different companies for the same
policy can vary by over 40%
The problem, of course, is knowing
how to go about finding the best
deal, which is where we come in
We analyse the rates charged by
all the reputable insurers -
including the household names to
obtain the best premium for your
particular circumstances. We will
send you the information within
7 days.
If you are about to renew your
motor insurance, fill in the form
opposite and send it off to us-
we've paid the postage, so you
can do it right now. (If the
renewal date is only a few days
away, telephone instead). Then
we will send you details of the
best deal we can find, together
with a proposal form.
This is a completely free service
If you decide to take up our
offer, we will make all the
necessary arrangements, and
there will still be no charge to you
over and above the insurance
premium.
While you are insured through
us, we will give you a complete
service, advise you relative
to any claims, arranging
foreign travel insurance and
so on.
When you have to renew again
next year, we will check your
premium again automatically
and send you a reminder.
Of course there is no obligation
whatever, but if most people
are paying over the odds for
their motor insurance, doesn't
it make sense to be certain you're
not one of them?
