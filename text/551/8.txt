Committee met on Wednesday
and one of the main topics
discussed was the question of
rents for^next year. After long
and sometimes bitter discussion,
• the committee failed to come to a
decision over the level of rents
that the residence committee
finance sub-committee wants to
impose next year, though it did
vote to make a representation to
college over the level of
repayments of the Evelyn
Gardens lease.
Further decisions reached
included the move to end
wardens places in hall.

Dear Colin
I object to being described as
being " n o t bothered to turn
up" for the Presidents' Race in
the IC Games.
I should like to point out that
I was at that time in the middle
of my finals and unfortunately
could not spare the time to
support the Games, much as I
would have liked to have done.
I did, however, ask my Hon
Sec to replace me in the race,
but we were told that substitutes
would not be allowed.
May I also point out to the
organisers that I was neither
informed of the date of the
Games nor instructed that there
would be a Presidents' event. I
suggest that better advance
publicity would increase the
support.
Yours
Jo
President, C & G U
The Mines Handover Union Meeting took place on Tuesday. Mines
have won many cups this year and the above pic shows the silver
trophies, bottle and Morphy Oar that were proudly displayed on the
Mines steps after the meeting. Keith Maynard (RSM President). Cris
Dobson (VP), and Rob Pascoe were ceremoniously thrown into the
sea at Brighton on Tuesday night.
We are in the middle of an international crisis. The Police
have to be patient. We need to keep cool. Imperial is in the
front line because of its location in the Arab cente of London.
No student from IC has been killed so far but there is a
chance that the situation could arise that we could be in the
line of fire or even a target.
Happily the Rag fete is still taking place tomorrow and
helpers are still needed. Meet on the Queens lawn at 10.00 am.
On Bank Holiday Monday Rag will be taking part in the
procession preceding Fulham Carnival.
Congratulations to Dave Fuller in being elected IC Radio
Station Manager for next year.
I apologise to IF for any bad feeling generated by last weeks
'SUN' FELIX. The S U N got its own back, yesterday, by putting
me on page three!
See you at the Rag Fete and hopefully well catch up on some
articles that we promised to give you this week plus a full
report of the Jez trip to Brighton in next week's FELIX
