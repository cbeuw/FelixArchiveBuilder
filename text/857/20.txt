The Snack Bar
I can already feel the Union Office hold its breath as
I type the word above. My predecessor spent a large
part of the year attacking the outlet and consequently
running it down. I do not intend to start an all out
onslaught.
The Snack Bar has lost a lot of money over the past
eighteen months and the Union has paid dearly for its
mistakes in the refurbishment and general revamp of
the outlet in 1988. It has taken a lot of time to realise
that a snack bar is exactly what it says it is; a place
which provides snacks. The kitchens in the Snack Bar
are underequipped for large scale hot food production,
and the cost of meals in this range is too high to be
profitworthy. The relaunch of the Snack Bar as a
Sandwich Bar is a wise move in my mind. The plans
which Ian Richards, the manager of the Snack Bar,
has shown me provide strong hope for good, filling,
economical food in the Union Building. I hope that
everyone who has moved away from eating in the
Union Building will take advantage of the introductory
offer and try the 'Caterpillar Cafe' once more.
Having said this I feel it is only fair to point out the
failings of the Union over this outlet in the past. Whilst
the Snack Bar has been losing money every day, too
much attention has been spent on petty points, like
the fine details of menu selection. The Union Catering
Committee has only just approached the main
problem-people have not been eating in the outlet,
and it has been selling food at a loss. People are not
driven away by the decor or a particular dish they do
not like, they are put off by high prices and small
portions; something the Snack Bar became famous
for last year. The final realisation that you do not make
food that has sold badly before and that you cannot
sell prepackaged food cheaply has finally dawned.
The crux of the problem is the plethora of meetings
which decide how the snack bar is run. Ian Richards
has been almost helpless to make any changes to the
outlet without first visiting these committees. He sees
what sells and what does not, and yet he has had little
say in menu selection within catering committee. If
the Union has had one major failing over the Snack
Bar it must be that of its bureaucratic quagmire which
slows the development of any Union outlet. If Ian is
to manage the snack bar, let him manage. After all,
if this relaunch fails, who stands to lose their job; Ian
or the Union Sabbaticals?
Peter's book for the week
Peter Hallworth is Managing Surveyor of Residences
and looks after the upkeep of halls of residence and
the Union Building. Each week I have been
metaphorically awarding him a book. This week's
book is the Pied Peter of Hamlet, perhaps Mr
Hallworth would like to invest in a flute now, I've
heard he is very good on the violin.
The Careers Service
I invite any letters for comment on IC's impending loss
of the Careers Library. If anybody has a spare
£10,000 please could they let the Rector know.
Sabbatical elections
If you want to be a sabbatical, you must be mad.
Being mad is fun, however. Anybody thinking of
standing for a sabbatical post should let me know if
they have any special requirements such as specially
coloured paper or inks.
Sabbatical videos
I have been asked to plug STOIC's live transmission
of this year's Hustings UGM and their election video
facilities. Anybody interested in making a promotional
video for their sabbatical campaign should contact
STOIC on 3518 before February 27. (I'll stick a bigger
plug in next week-Mr Lester has given me a 13 amp
one, but the wiring's dodgy.)
