Three in a bed
Dear Mr Editor
I am delighted to inform you
that this year's sabbatical Union
Officers are working extremely
well together, and I anticipate a
united year in the Union Office.
Yours in expectation
Gaynor Lewis
President
A woman's
touch
Dear Pallab
I wish to express my shock at
the recent changes to the Union
Office. Not only has the Union's
extensive collection of used
cardboard boxes and old files
been thrown out but also the
chairs have actually been cleaned.
After attending the SUSOC
knitting conference I understand
that Christine Teller has decided
that it would be cheaper to knit
the next set of Union curtains. I
would not be surprised to learn
that the unusual size of Jo
Hewanicka's new desk just
happens to coincide with the
latest Woman's Realm dress
pattern.
I have even heard rumours
that the dynamic duo have
decided a new colour scheme for
the Union Office using a Laura
Ashley Bedroom design.
I would be the last person to
suggest that they have the Union
sewn up, but next year's officers
may well sport matching Shetland
jumpers.
I remain, yours sincerely,
Stephen Goulder
IC Union Decorator
No nookie
Dear Ed
I have been here a year now.
And everything has turned out
quite well. There is everything
here a man could want, other
men that is. But for myself...well
...eight years at a public school
has left me rather sore about
that sort of thing. The masters
were so demanding.
It's not that the lack of women
disappoints me. No, it's the lack
of action by the Union Executive.
You would have thought with all
this knowledge and expertise of
this centre of academic scientific
excellence we could make some
of our own. Women that is.
Yours

Dear Sir
In my perusal of the Postgraduate
FELIX a certain photograph
(p5) grasped my eye. In the
aforementioned picture the
former champagne swilling,
cigar smoking President Stephen
Goulder is seen passing over the
Presidential cannabis pouch
(presumably filled) to his
successor. I think that such a
tradition is disgraceful in a
latter-day student union which is
supposed to be the forefront of
the students of IC.
Any person off the street when
seeing this photograph would
get the impression that all
students can afford cigars,
champagne and dope.
Yours faithfully
Michael Newperson

Margaret Thatcher, H M The
Queen, the Archbishop of
Canterbury and Mr Richard
Ingrams.
The on we had
to print
Dear Pallab
I would like to take this
opportunity of wqishing you
luck with your organ in the
coming year, I'm sure that, in
addition to the wit and inven-
tiveness you will bring to the
paper, you will maintain the
high standards of production we
have come to expect. I look
forward to raidng a fun news-
paper free from technical errers.
Yours sincerely

Porno Pallab
Dear Pallab
In my recent sojourn of the
FELIX Office I have noticed
that it has degenerated into a
den of iniquity and vice. Porno-
graphic magazines can be seen
lying about the tables and chairs
at sporadic intervals, God
knows how many are in the
Editor's Office. Not only this,
certain people of dubious
natures have been entering your
upstairs office with you and
returning at a much later
interval in time. The corrupting
influence is self-evident if even
Anti-Porn Crusader Michael
Newman can be drawn into this
web of vice. You must clean the
office up.
PS: I'll do the decorating.

Teller Tells All
Dear Pallab
Through the pages of your
august journal. I feel I must give
vent to my feelings of
overwhelming bewilderment at
working in an office of foreign
sabbaticals. I have tried teaching
them esperanto, sign language
and having them subtitled but all
to no avail. The problem is
compounded by the Polish
inclinations of the Union
receptionist who has a propensity
for gabbling incoherently on the
phone.
I have found the only solution
is to hold long and meaningful
conversations with my filing
cabinets whilst counting large
amounts of small change through
the coin counter, possibly the
only machine in the office
capable of competing with the
verbal garbage emanating form
the surrounding sabbaticals.
Chris Teller
Deputy President
Dressing Down
Dear Pallab
I wish to protest most strongly
about the deplorable drop in
standards of dress and appear-
ance by this year's Exec. After
the cultured, dashing, debonair
Stephen Goulder, this year's
Exec are a real shambles.
It wouldn't be so bad if one of
them wasn't so gormless and the
other didn't have a face like a
horse.
Yours sincerely
M McKenna
Grim Prospects
Dear Pallab
I would like to complain most
strongly about the quality of this
year's IC Prospectus. Not only
has the cover been changed - how
are people to recognise it, I ask -
but some of the oldest and most
treasured photos have been
omitted. Ever since my arrival six
years ago I have kept pinned to
my wall a copy of the 1950s photo
of a young man happily playing a
guitar as a model for my own
behaviour. To whom are today's
freshers expected to look for
guidance?. It's no wonder the
place is going to the dogs.
Yours outraged
Aloysius J Spriggs
Horse Rubbish
Sir
Your present campaign against
Chris Teller is disgraceful. Some
of the things you have said in the
course of it are tantamount to
suggesting that not only does
Chris have a face like a horse but
that Chris is a lady as well. Both
these charges are as false as they
are disgraceful. Mind you, I
couldn't help laughing.
Yours etc
