Union
Overseas Students Fees
Some of you may realise that a
judgement made at the House of
Lords last December may affect
your classification as an overseas
students. A change was made in the
definition of 'ordinary residence'
which will affect the fees you have
to pay, ie overseas or home student
rates. The judgement could affect
your classification for the 1982/3
academic session.
Previously, the Department of
Education and Science would not
c o u n t periods spent i n higher
education as ordinary residence in
the U K , however this situation has
now changed. But there are a
number of loopholes in the regu-
lations so don't get too hopeful.
At present the situation is: if you
b e l i e v e y o u were i n c o r r e c t l y
classified as an overseas student
d u r i n g the session 1982/3, you
s h o u l d w r i t e to the C o l l e g e
Registrar ( M r P Mee) formally,
making this point, briefly stating
the grounds lor your claim and
indicating the amount of fees you
have paid. The deadline for the
official notification is 31 August
1983. If College believe you are
likely to be in this situation you
should have received notification
by mail.
II anybody wishes to come and
talk to me to discuss their classifica-
tion, please do so as soon as possible, I
hope I can be of some help.
I should also add that under the
terms of the new Education (Fees
and Awards Act, which has applied
from 1 July 1983, all periods spent
in education will be excluded from
the establishement of three years
'ordinary residence'. Therefore you
may still be classified as an overseas
student for the 1983/4 session.
It is vital that if you wish to make
a claim concerning classification
that you notify College by 31
August, otherwise your claim will
not be valid.

Chris Hendy, this year's
Postgraduate Affairs
Officer discusses the
Postgraduate Group and
its activities. He gives a
b r i e f resume of last
year's academic issues
and the group's social
activities.
Due to increasing apathy amongst
its members, the Postgraduate
Group at Imperial has, in recent
years, seen a decline in its activities.
I hope this year to see more active
support, instead of leaving all the
work to the committee. We'll give
you as much support as you give us.
The main academic issues raised
last year were, the status of the
Diploma of Imperial College (DIC)
and the registering of writing up
students as part time.

The D I C situation has hopefully
been resolved, the awarding of an
alternative advanced study certi-
ficate to those who fail to complete
course requirements shelved. As far
as the position regarding writing
up students is concerned. I'll be
honest in being somewhat ignorant.
I am however investigating the
situation and would be grateful for
any details of problems that writing
up students have experienced.
A n important point for those of
you who have worked between
school and college and/or college
and starting postgraduate studies.
Y o u may be eligible for extra
money from your gra«t awarding
council—it's worth checking.
As yet I have been unable to
form a full committee and am
looking for volunteers to stand for
various posts. Compared to the
benefits that can be gained the
effort required is minimal, so if you
are at all interested please see me as
soon as possible.
Social events for the coming year
will commence with the Plough-
man's L u n c h on O c t o b e r 11,
tickets will be available during the
first week of term. A couple of
brewery trips have also been
arranged before Christmas. If there
is sufficient interest I should also
like to see footfjall a n d darts
leagues over the winter.
E a c h year the P o s t g r a d u a t e
Group gets a grant from IC Union.
Over the last few years there has
been difficulty in disposing of the
money. If you have a trip organised,
or need a new football etc for your
d e p a r t m e n t team you may be
eligible for some money towards it.
If the money isn't used the grant
will be distributed elsewhere next
session.
If you've bothered to read this
article, thank you for your interest
and I hope you will give your
support during the coming year.
Remember postgraduates repre-
sent 25% of all students at Imperial,
let's make an effort to present
ourselves as such.
From September 19 I can be
contacted in the Neurobiology
Lab, Dept of Pure and Applied
Biology or the Sub-Warden's flat
Falmouth H a l l (int 3352). I hope
you have a successful year and
Jook foward to meeting you.

During the summer term and the
summer vacation there has been a
steep increase in the number of
thefts that have taken place in the
Union Building. O n at least five
occasions either one or a group of
students have forced entry into
different rooms and taken large
objects worth several hundred
pounds, and, in some cases have
even taken personal possessions
such as wallets, chequebooks,
credit cards, etc. So if you see
anyone acting suspiciously would
you please inform security (under
Beit Arch) immediately.
