12CF and Comparisons
Paul Plaitypus looks like John O'Neill of
the Undertones, sings like Soft Cell's Marc
Almond (sometimes), owns a record label
and founded Twelve Cubic Feet. As if this
weren't enough he writes most of their
songs and plays guitar.
In April 1981 he placed the obligatory
advert in the music press and via a band
called Purple Forest teamed up with Fred
Durell, a female singerand keyboard
player.
The band then changed their name to
Twelve Cubic Feet and recorded an EP in
October 1981. Unfortunately this wasn't
released until August 1982 (on Paul's
Namedrop label).
As a profit-making venture the EP failed
but around 500 copies were sold, and
according to the band, is still available
through Rough Trade.
Since then the band has undergone
I
several personnel changes and gigged very
little recently due to the introduction of
new members. In addition to Paul and
Fred the band includes Arnold Flagstaff
(lead guitarist) and drummer Dave Morgan,
a 'veteran' of the London music scene who
has played with bands supporting acts as
varied as JoBoxers and Funkapclitan and
rates 12CF as the best band he's played
with to date.
The IC influence comes from the two
most newest members: Eric Jarvis, one-
time physicist and stalwart of the IC rock
scene (guitarist for the legendary Futile
Hurling and bassist for 12CF) and the
petite Franky Williams, microbiology
graduate, clarinet player and singer.
As mentioned above personnel hassles
have curtailed the bands recent live
performances so this preview is based on
watching the band rehearse and on the

Practise Makes Perfect
I remember once sitting in the FELIX
Office with a group of Dramsoc thespi?n
s
as Eric Jarvis held forth on the subjsct of
rehearsals—'People have survived a
weekend on just one sandwich to attend
rehearsals', he opined as the company
prepared to go to the Edinburgh Fringe
Festival. Now a year later a new band of
hopefuls are rehearsing for the fringe and
Eric is over an hour late.
Twelve Cubic Feet begin without him,
Arnold playng bass. The result is
frequently chaotic, their cheeky post-punk
pop suffering as the vocals and clarinet
are lost in the mix whilst the lead guitar is
missing and the keyboard fights a losing
battle with the rampant rhythm section.
In time-honoured music journalist
tradition I retire to the bar and return
forty-five minutes later to find the band at
full strength.
This time round 12CF really do cook-
rhythm guitar, bass and drums meshing to
form a foil for some 'catchy' guitar and
keyboards. Again the vocals are lost but
the same had happened to Echo and the
Bunnymen less than 100 yards away the
week before and they nearly lifted the roof
off the Albert Hall. 12CF lack the intensity
and searing power of Echo (and I'm sure
it doesn't unduly worry them) but they've
got a beat you can dance to, melodies
you can hum and two pretty girl singers—
what more do they need and what more
do you want?
Looking Forward
In line with their ambitious debut EP
(review alongside) 12CF are now breaking
out of the routine live rock format to play
in Dramsoc's two hour presentation at the
Edinburgh Fringe Festival. There, people
miming to their songs will only be one of
the many sprogs on this marriage of
music and theatre. In the meantime they
are one of a package of three bands and
a poet playing Adam's Arms in Conway
Street, W1, tomorrow night (Saturday).

A Pretty Thing
Twelve Cubic Feet's Straight
Out T h e Fridge is a pretty
impressive and unusuei
product even before
play it (barring some of the
dodgy artwork in the pack-
age).
It's a seven track 10" EP
with a high quality glossy
sleeve (a pretty blue and
pink illustration) and an
eighteen page booklet with
lyrics and info. It's even
pressed on heavy vinyl and
has an inner sleeve!
Of the seven tracks only
two are definitely in the
band's current live show:
one is Hello Howard, easily
their best with a memorable
chorus and some of the
'best' lyrics I've heard in a
long time.
Deisel engines fill my head
They run on my one track
mind
They're the only form of
transport I can find
The Undertones imme-
diately come to mind (is
there any higher praise?)
(Biased-Ed).
Mary's got the bug is also
played in the current set but
thankfully Fred isn't as
spikey-voiced as she was in
1981. The 'spikeyness' works
much better on Blob, a song
about masturbation which
deserves to make it into the
live set.
The other major song on
the EP is The Almshouse,
12CF's shot at a long seri-
ous number in which only
the pretentious lyrics de-
tract from the atmosphere of
the number.
