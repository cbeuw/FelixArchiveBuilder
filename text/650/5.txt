Goulder goes out with a bang!
Mr Stephen Goulder, retiring
ICU President, formally handed
over to his successor Miss
Gaynor Lewis on his last day in
office at the top of the Queen's
Tower. The handover came at
the end of an afternoon of wine
and champagne provided by Mr
Goulder.
The Queen's Tower, perhaps
South Kensington's best phallic
if somewhat castrated symbol
provided an excellent oppor-
tunity for an ego massage for Mr
Goulder and a chance to give
Miss Lewis a tongue-in-cheek
kiss.
Mr Goulder, typically absent-
minded to the last, handed over
the keys to his Linstead Hall
room instead of the Union
Office keys. It was reported that
they later went off together and
had some hanky-panky.
SHERFIELD
SECRETARIES
PULL IT OFF!
Davy Handover
The mascot of RSMU, Davy, an oversized Davy lamp, was
returned to them on 19 June. It had been stolen by RCSU an
hour before a Mines UGM in February. After fulfilling a
ransom which was a Rag collection in front of Harrods,
raising nearly £200 for charity, Davy was amicably
exchanged.
Two College secretaries really
pulled their fingers out when the
message came from above to
'save, save, save'.
Sylvia Stirling, Assistant
Registrar, and Marilyn Evers,
principal clerk to IC publica-
tions department slashed
£10,000 off the price of the
College Prospectus this year.
They have also stunned College
bosses with a Prospectus that is
one of the glossiest and most
interesting for years.

Ex-ICU supremo Steve Goul-
der and College Number Two,
John Smith, have both already
backed the design.
