ARTHUR ANY ROOMS?
Mr Michael Arthur, Student
Services Officer, ran into severe
problems with the management of
the Summer Lettings Scheme.
Examples of overbooking, incor-
rect charging and mismanage-
ment were rife in the first two
weeks of the scheme's operation.
The extent of the overbooking
only became apparent when
people began arriving at Evelyn
Gardens where single rooms
were found to be substantially
overbooked. When questioned
about this Mr Arthur declined to
give a figure but said that only a
'handful' of people were affected.
To accommodate these people
double rooms were let as single
rooms. When these rooms had
been filled people had to be
ferried to other Head Tenancies
and to the Halls of Residence.
Student Services had to resort to
booking rooms in Southside
from the Summer Accommo-
dation Centre at double the rate
paid at Evelyn Gardens.
The Summer Letting Scheme is
of crucial importance to student
residence. The income gained
offsets the full cost of student
residences. This particular aspect
of residence came under detailed
examination by John Lauwerys in
his recent report into student
residence. Mr Lauwerys drew
attention to the small income
generated by vacation letting
compared to that during term
time. To improve this for the
current vacation, a more realistic,
allocation of rooms was given to
the conference office (Linstead
and parts of Southside) leaving
Student Services to fill Evelyn
Gardens, Hamlet Gardens, the
Fremantle Hotel and the other
Halls of Residence. Michael
Arthur, together with his student
managers mounted a strong
advertising campaign to fill these
rooms.
However, when the bookings
were taken, they were not put on a
chart or in a diary so Student
Services were unaware that
overbooking was taking place. It
appeared that the percentage
occupancy was high for the
summer, whereas there were
periods of heavy booking and
periods where a lull occurred. In
accepting advanced deposits
Student Services committed itself
to accommodating these people.
They are however attempting to
sidestep their legal obligation by
returning these deposits. This
action has caused a great deal of
complaint from prospective
customers.
Mr Arthur has encountered a
further problem with the discount
scheme that he had devised for
people who stay longer than four
weeks. This discount was calcul-
ated by adjusting the VAT charged
on rent. However, it was
discovered that the discounted
rent fell below a previously agreed
minimum. To remedy this Mr
Arthur did some 'creative account-
ing' to raise the basic rent so that
when the V A T component was ch-
arged the overall figure exceeded
the agreed minimum. This has
been confirmed by a very authori-
tative source within Imperial
College. Though Mr Arthur's
action may not be illegal, its
disclosure will be acutely embar-
rassing to him.
The Summer Lettings Scheme
is set to achieve a surplus
significantly higher than in
previous years. Much of this
success is as a result of the hard
work of Jim Donaldson and his
team of Summer Lettings Mana-
gers. Mr Donaldson was instru-
mental in holding the Summer
Lettings Scheme together during
Michael Arthur's absence.
