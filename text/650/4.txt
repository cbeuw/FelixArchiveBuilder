RECTOR
RESIGNS
Fire in
Chemistry
Fire engulfed a chemistry
department room on 25 July
after an experiment involving
acetone and pure oxygen ignited
in a fume cupboard. Dr Edwards
managed to turn off the oxygen
supply and closed off the fume
cupboard, despite his clothes
being set alight by the explosion.
He then went to the laboratory
next door where the flames on
his clothing were put out using a
C 0 2 extinguisher.
Miscarriage
of
Justice
A Conference Centre employee
found her job gone when she
returned from maternity leave.
Ms Eithne Cullity, a grade 4
principal clerk with four years'
service was told her job was no
longer available due to re-
organisation. She was offered
alternative jobs as a shop
assitant and a stores clerk, and
then three months' tax-free
salary and a month's tax payed'
in lieu of notice as compensa-
tion. She is now taking the
College to an industrial tribunal
to claim unfair dismissal.
Mr John Davidson, Personnel
Secretary, was unavailable for
comment.
The fire alarm was raised by
Professor Wilkinson's secretary
whislt Professor Sir Geoffrey
Wilkinson led members of his
section fighting the fire. They
wore breathing apparatus to
reach the fire. It was a measure
of their success that they had
brought the fire under control as
three fire engines arrived on the
scene. Mr Bob Fogan, College
Fire Officer, told FELIX that he
was very pleased by the way
those concerned reacted to the
emergency. He emphasised that
had the fire not been brought
under control quckly it could
easily have spread throughout
the chemistry department.
No Cunt
No Fuck
The words 'cunt' and 'fuck' have
been banned from the Rag Mag
by the sabbatical officers as they
were deemed to be possibly
offensive to the majority of
people in ICU.
The sabbatical officers of the
Executive were mandated at a
U G M last year to censor mat-
erial which they considered
might be offensive to the
majority of students. This action
was taken to prevent the ban-
ning of this Rag Mag and its
subsequent loss of sales, to non-
members of the Union.
Other material banned in-
cluded jokes relating to geri-
atrics, babies, disabled people
and unnatural disasters. Racist,
sexist and religious jokes have
been allowed to remain as they
will only offend certain insig-
nificant minorities within ICU.
Meany Mooney
Swindle Scandal
Victor Mooney, Refectory
Manager, has used heavy-
handed methods to prevent
student cleaners from having
breakfasts in his refectories.
The students pay for the
breakfasts with breakfast tickets
given to them as tips. The tickets
are worth £2.50 each, which is
paid for by SAC.
Mr Mooney knows, from
experience that less than 75% of
ftge 4 B H B H H M I
the paying guests eat the break-
fasts, therefore he has ordered
that 25% fewer breakfasts than
have been ordered, be cooked.
Mr Mooney thus extracts
payment for not cooking food
that has been paid for. This has
caused ill feeling between the
kitchen staff and the cleaners as
the threat of security guards has
been used to enforce Mr Mooney's
orders.
Dr Lionel March, Rector of the
Royal College of Art, resigned
on Monday following mounting
criticism of his management of
the college. Dr March's resig-
nation centred around his
appointment of Dr George
Sting, his friend and former
colleague at the Open University,
to the newly created post of
Dean. Soon after his appoint-
ment it was reported that Dr
Sting was holding onto his
previous job in America. Dr
Sting denied this and this denial
was supported by Dr March.
Further checks revealed these
reports to be true. This led to Dr
Sting's resignation, followed
shortly by that of Dr March.
Dr March's period as Rector
was contraversial from the start.
His appointment led to the
resignation of five members of
the college governing council.
His decision to spend £150,000
on a new rectorial suite at a time
when financial restricitons were
forcing cutbacks in other areas
of the college angered many
academic staff and students.
Many felt that he lacked the
proper experience for the post
and that his field of study was
irrelevant to the bulk of the
work carried out in the RCA.
Carabine Quits
Dr Mike Carabine finished his period as Warden of Linstead
Hall at the end of last term. He was presented with a silver
salver by the residents of the hall in appreciation of his ten years'
dedicated work as Warden.
He is retiring to a country retreat in deepest Sussex, a
pleasant change from the raucous environment of a student-filled
hall of residence.
