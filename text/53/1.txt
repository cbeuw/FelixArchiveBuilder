Sly awnoiy of what happened i n the bar afterwards i s
not too clear. Tony G i l l " a s M.C. introduced one by one
the Captain of this, the President of that, the Vice of

f i e R.S.M. Union meeting on Tuesday 20th ran
off saootfely and according to schedule. The main
twlm#sfis was certain alterations i s the system of .
electing.year representatives to the Union
Conwittee. Post-grads, gradually increasing i n
number, received special consideration and debate.
An interesting ruling here held that a l l post-grads
be considered to constitute a 'year'; i.e. no *
-iirtlaotien should he aa.de betweenWIS)of different
years as at present understood. This raised same

The IHnes Freshers are not treated with a mere buffet
l i k e the other one. . They get a f u l l , big dinner as a
welcome. This year's dinner, on Eriday, the SSrd, .Baa 'as
good as ever. Warming up parties were held i n various
pubs nearby, though mainly i n the Queens Anas and of boar®©
the Union bar. There host and fresher got together, met
others and generally got into shape f o r the evening that
lay ahead. At 7.50 sharp, they went up, saw to i t that
the b a r r e l s of 'beer were not neglected, and ate an excellent
meal. She speeches that followed were short and sharp.
The stories, told by students and'alders a l i k e , were a
severatest of how f a r to go end a© further at a dinner,
iuisjjfcook care of the comparitively f orated part of the
evening. Then the exodus started -
Down to the bar f o r drinking the Yard. A new member
of the staff very sportingly drank i t l i k e the t H t miner
that he i s . The student freshers then had a go,
punctuated''by such selected personalities as the. other
College Presidents, two Coildnen that were found in'the
bar (shandy f o r one and orange squash and water f o r the
other). Crackers kept going o f f throughout the dinner
and the Yard, and f i n a l l y the c u l p r i t , a prominent hockey
player, was debagged and made to stand on the bar. the*
Guildsmen at this stage got a miniature beer bath - thus
sanctified, they were allowed to stay on. Thus the
evening d l i w to a close, an epic was r e c i t e d and the T»rfe8
moved out. Before we go, congratulations to l i r . Hopwood
for winning the Yard i n 10.8 sees, and to the Hon. Pomo-
grapher f o r drinking, h i s nearly 5-pint pot at one go.
A few fireworks i n the quadrangle, a l i t t l e "Ch&rcoal',
and then we decided that the Royal College of Art hadn't
learnt i t s lesson a couple of years ago and needed another.
They very thoughtlessly had decided to hold a "Red Ross
Social" t h i s evening, to which the ".liners i n v i t e d themselves)
at I I p.m. The people there very courteously a or so i t
seemed - offered the Miners some refreshments - as i f any
offer was necessary. Glancing around the big H a l l , a b i g
bright f i s h hanging proudly at the Hall's end caught the
eye - presumably the result of countless man-hours of work
by R.C.A. carpenters and a r t i s t s , and hence worthy1
of
attention. ; After due apologies, i t was taken down, as
iwas a large paper head, and the owners thanked f o r t h e i r
generosity. The trophies were then marched i n procession
back to the Mines and deposited f o r the Bight. Thisvis
the f i r s t time i n recent history that any members of 1.0.
had 'liberated' anything from another College. A3 was
implied by one of the Dinner speakers, there might b«j 650
Gulldsmen and 850 R.C.S. students, but I t i s the 150 Miners
that do things i n I.C. - keep i t up, Ulnars.' .
