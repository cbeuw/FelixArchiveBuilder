A l e t t e r was published i n the last FELIX complaining
about the breakfast regulations at present i n force i n the
Union refectory. Several people have pointed out that
Hostel';residents are firmly opposed to these regulations,
and do not ask f o r more privileges as suggested by the
author. Same - very few, admittedly, - argue that
breakfast i s a meal meant expressly f o r Hostel residents and
not f o r the Union as a whole. Throughout this controversy,
the Refectory has kept quiet, without expressing views one
way or another - at least, that i s what we thought.
We now f i n d that lor. Baty has received a reply from
somebody who i s connected with the running of the Refectory.
What the l e t t e r says, whether i t i s an apology, an explanation,
or a rebuttal we don't know and i n faftt that i s besides the
point. I t i s the accepted'rule that a l l accusations" made i n
any letters to the.. 23dftor are replied to i n the same columns.
Writing personally to the author i s just not done. Why
then was FELIX l e f t out of this question? People write
letters to newspapers because they concern something that
i s of interest to the general reader, because tjhey f e e l
that rsore people should know about i t . . Many letters to
'FELIX originate i n the discussions going on i n the Bar or
the lounge, when somebody thinks that more people than'
those within earshot should know the views or- complaints
or suggestions that he has to put forward. Well ajfid
proper. Now i f another person feels differently, or feels
that he i s responsible f o r replying to that l e t t e r ,
i m e d i a t e l y puts pen to paper and sends i t to the newspaper
f o r publication. This i s normal practice.
The Refectory on the other hand seems to have different
ideas. The question of breakfast f o r Union members i s not
a remote one, or one concerning a very limited number of
students. . itathermore, i t i s a principle, and not
"merely breakfast, that i s involved. Surely i f they have
to say something on the matter JELIX i s the place to say
i t . They might have, an explanation regarding those
regulations, i n -which case i t should be put forward frankly
and squarely before the student /body. TheJSmight have an
apologyt"^rh£(&. again should be tendered similarly. Or
they might be angry with a'student poktag h i s nose where,
i n t h e i r opinion, he-shouldn't. Whatever i t might be
should be made public, or i f they so desire kept entirely
quiet - not a word to anybody. To send a reply to the
author of the l e t t e r i s very strange indeed. Have: they
something to hide? Something which they would rather not
see being published? FELIX protests strongly about this
eoourrance and hopes that some l i g h t . i s shed on the matter
% people concerned. I t i s as near an insult as was ever
received By us and we do not l i k e i t one b i t .
We a p o l o g i s e f o r t h e t e r r i b l e p r o d u c t i o n

V I E W P O I N T .
Last week, guilds held a union meeting. Most people
would have called i t a fireworks display. Not so long ago,
a union meeting was an occasion f o r witty debate; i f a
subject -was up f o r discussion a fellow was expected to
persuade the union by the logic of his argument and not, as
i s the case nowadays, by blasting out the other persons views
with 'penny bangers'.
The new session seems to he-i-e brought forth a great
many of these incendiaries. We hear of them at the hops and
at the Mines freshers dinner where they treated the one they
caught as a l l such hooligans should be treated. Too many of
our ' l e t t i n g - o f f steam' a c t i v i t i e s axe l i t t l e more than
hooliganism. Too seldom do wa hear of incidents which display
some o r i g i n a l i t y .
The worthwhile rags are usually those with some fore
thought and as organised rags axe frowned upon at I.C. perhaps
i t i s to be expacted that our outbursts of student exhuberanee
should tend -towards hooliganism. But events i n the past few
weeks show that some members o f I.C. have reached a new peak
i n rowdyism. I t was only l a s t yfa&r that some misguided
character was made to apologize f o r throwing part of a
lavatory c i s t e r n at the president of Guilds during one of
their union meetings. Yet. nowadays, i t seams to be considered
the thing to throw as many fireworks as the duration of the
meeting'will allow.
This sudden decline i n behaviour seems to indicate
that muoh of the blame lays with the freshers. The freshers
seem to think that I.C. i s the place to continue their
schoolboy pranks o f the sixth form which they have recently
l e f t . Hence i t i s up to the seoond and t h i r d year men to show
the freshers how to behave at a university - and i f example
doesh't teach them, perhaps the Mines method will convince
them o f the f o l l y of their ways.
„ Never l e t i t be thought that explosions, i n general,
are to be deplored. Used occasionally, and with some thought,
an explosion i s an excellent thing. And this applies to the
cacophony of horns, bugles etc. that often drown the words of
those who do attempt to give soma meaning to a union meeting.
On occasions, such diversions are very useful but
continually to blow o r operate these instruments detracts
a l o t from t h e i r effect.
A union meeting i s to discuss any matter that concerns -
the membei-s of that union. Such matters are the provision of
items on the top floors o f the various colleges (Mines have
got theirs; Guilds are s t i l l waiting). A l l of us will reap
the benefits nf these i n s t a l l a t i o n s which would not have
been possible i f the conditions at our present union i
had prevailec i n the past. Fusilier.
FASHION CORNER
HOW TO HE SMART AT I.C.
Whilst agreeing that most of the people you
see at I.C. c l o s e l y resemble walking rag bags, I
w i l l say that there are some whose appearance at
l e a s t does them some oredlt . You may be able to
stand that greasy p a i r of corduroy bags up In the
corner at night, but there are c e r t a i n other
aspects to a p a i r of trousers that to my mind are
a l i t t l e more desirable. Of course, i f yon are
i n the habit of r o l l i n g about in the gutter, or
maybe sleeping i n Council dustbins then you might
as well not read t h i s a r t i o l e , because a greasy
p a i r of bags w i l l be f a r better f o r you anyway.
To be smart i n I.C. as i n a l l oiv?lized
so'oietlea, you have to conform to c e r t a i n patterns
of dress. The average ohappie at I.C. conforms
to a general pattern i n that his everyday wear i s
some kind of sports ooat; however, i f he wishes
to be r e a l l y i n the fashion he wears a smartly
cut Bookstall Blazer together with some brightly ^
polished-brass buttons and sc^e sort of oollege
i n s i g n i a on h i s top pooket. Invariably he wears
a p a i r of trousers, p a r t l y f o r decency's sake i n
summer time and f o r warmness' sake i n winter tine.
E n g l i s h W o r s t e d and Gaberdine seam to be the new
season's ' t r e n d , boys; and by the "fay note the
E d w a r d i a n t r e n d i n i m i t a t i o n drain-pipes; they
seem t o be a l l t h e r a g e at the Royal School of
A r t s , where I t i s becoming increasingly d i f f i c u l t
to d i s t i n g u i s h between the two sexes. The
female memfcers have not succeeded in cultivating
beards yet, so at l e a s t we have one yardstick to
d i s t i n g u i s h the lambs from the goats.
For shoes, the best type to wear are the
f e l t - t o p crepes, whioh not only require l i t t l e or
no cleaning but also do not need to go to the
oobblers u n t i l you can f e e l the pavement under
your t o o t s i e s . To look p r e t t y round the neok
wear one of the oollege t i e s , .but a silk square
of some loud ana garish hue w i l l do just as well.
Headpieces of the t r i l b y type are rare in I.C.,
but i f you do r e a l l y suffer from oolds in the
head, a ' l i t t l e corduroy ' f l a t 'at' w i l l do.
Duffles are f a i r l y common i n I.e., but raincoats
generally f i t the issue for the average bod.
Thus i n t h i s b r i e f survey I have given yon,
as the Ann® Edwards of I.C., a brief resume of
current f o i b l e s in dress. Not that I expect
any of you to take e great deal of notice of what
I have written, b
