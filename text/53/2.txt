Great confusion rpigns in the Union Oiiice this year -
when Lrs. Robb. shouts "JohnJ", both tile President and
Secretary answer. The only solution to the difficulty has
been to label them John-filly and John. La3t week FJ2LIX
profiled John Willy; this week it's John.
John Murray Hathaway spent his school days at Felsted
school, where he rose to the position of school prefect and
head of his house, at.the same time gaining a lively interest
in various sports, including rugger, squash and swimming,
and (
.
'
) Physics.
The nation then requested his services for eighteen
months. lie entered the Royal Artillery, and later, ;_ons
officer cadet school, gaining a commission as second
lieutenant. After four idle months in an amy/ pigeon-
hole at Vi'oolwioh, he was sent off to Gibraltar in charge of
a maintenance battery. A many-sided job was this - i t
included supervising regimental sports, paying off the
keeper of the apes, ( whose presence is the traditional
guarantee of continued .British possesion of the Rock),
clearing the wreckage of an exploded ammunition ship, and
appearing as witness in a Spaniel-, court. John's National
service seens to have given Mm a love of big guns, which
nay explain his nresent position as Union Sec. But as yet
no blast or rockets have issued i'roj. the Union Office.
. John flew back from Oib. in August '51 to become a very
green R. C.S. fresher. Runour has i t that he even Mistook
Dai Nicholas for the Rector.' At any rate he was one of the
quiet few at R.C.S. union meetings, and studied hard to
remove the mental rust of unlettered Amy life. It was
not long, however, t i l l the Rugger club discovered him, and
he became a member of the I.C. "A" team - one of 'the boys'
who kept in shape by continual elbow-bending exoercise i n
the bar.
Second year found him as year rep., Chairman of K.O.S.
•Entertainments Committee, and on the top floor of the old
Hostel, where he distinguished himself by kicking a rugger
ball through the glass doors. Later i n the year an old
rugger injury recurred to put him in bed during VJhitsun and
shortly after Coronation. As a result he has had to join
the spectators at rugger games, but i s s t i l l an enthusiastic
supporter of the club. His other sporting activities
continue unabated, especially squash - "the Hostel game".
\!hen this year he became Seoretary of the Union, he
v/as strongly urged to move from his perch atop the Old
Hostel to a more accessible room, but firmly refused, saying
that five flights of stairs would lighten his work by
eliminating a l l but the meat serious visitors. Actually,
it has not worked out that way - John himself uses the room
only between the hours of 12 p.m. and 8 a.m. - but he s t i l l
manages to be extremely elusive.
Like most science students, his extra-curricular
interests are non-scientific. They include the reading of
classical literature and poetry, music (hot quite to the
Mozart stage yet"), and ballet. He i s keenly interested in
other people, and enjoys watching their antics on tube trains
and city streets. Since the simmer of ^88 John has become
a keen Christian, and is a committee member of the Christian
Union. His practical faith finds expression in a l l his
activities and Attitudes. On executive matters he tends
to have definite opinions which are expressed with clarity
ind a certain restrained forcefulness. He finds Council
meetings tiring, beoause one has to thin!: like mad i f one
is to be of any use to the Union."
Sensitive, esajressiVe, yet controlled, he can be easily
hurt by a friend vino lets him down. Indeed this is
possibly his greatest fault - i f fault i t i s - that he
expects the same high standard of dependability from hio
friends as he does of himself. But i t i s rather difficult
to find fault with him, and his acquaintances sum him up as
an all-rounder, well-worth knowing.
A. Grand Eviction Party was held by ix. J. Douglas and
Mr. 3. George at their Sydney Street residence on the
night of V/ednesday 21st Oct. Guests provided their own
entertainment in the form of beer and wine. Other
entertainment was provided during the evening by a large
police sergeant, an enraged landlady, furiouo neighbours,
and a piano full eight feet high.
Rags went out years ago, but we l i k e t o do
something f o r the freshers,- One of the happiest
things about them i s t h e i r capeolty for being
r e t o l d ; f o r the Rag i n progress i s often rather
d u l l and longwinded, and always very a r t i f i c i a l .
X remember howling with laughter on being
t o l d about tm Rag o f a l l time: how some stu-
dents dressed as labourers unloaded a heap of
road-mending t o o l s i n P i c c a d i l l y Circus, then dug
up the road, d i v e r t i n g a l l the t r a f f i c , and than
went hone.
A while ago I heard about the smart,
courteous, well-spoken student who approached a
gentleman s t r o l l i n g i n Clubland, and asked him
i f he "would mind holding the end of this tape,
while X c a r r y the other end round the comer.
Surveying, you know." The gentleman was vary
o b l i g i n g , but, twenty minutes l a t e r , grew restive)
and went round the corner t o r e g i s t e r a wall brad
complaint. He was astonished t o find * similar
gentleman standing a few yards away, patiently
holding tho other end o f the tape.
However n e i t h e r o f these unfortunate victims
of student humour was quite so surprised as a
Birmingham student who, r e t u r n i n g to College
a f t e r a doubtful week-end, found that his oar had
been dismantled and reassembled i n his bedroom.
It i s also rumoured that a f r i e n d of his, who com-
plained a t the uncomfortable quality of this joke.
had occasion t o go home a few weeks later, leaving
his oar i n Birmingham. His r e t u r n to College was
g r e a t l y aoeelarated by the a r r i v a l by post, at h i s
house, of sections o f h i s car.
Our own "29" Club has an increasing reputation
for work with paint and footprints. Nevertheless,
looking i n t o the past, i t seems that i t i s not
o r i g i n a l . Birmingham again. Two years ago dawn
broke on a p u b l i c square where stood statues of
the mighty dead. A set o f footprints i n whit*
paint were seen on the square. They led down Off
one o f the pedestals, into a u r i n a l , out, and beak
up t o the p e d e s t a l . On another oooasion a
fountain i n the same square poured froth a l l over
the road. The water had been treated with deter-
gent .
The yarns are endless. Most old students
could t e l l you h a l f a dozen, a l l muoh better than
these. The London Speoial i s H o kidnap somebody
else's mascot, and send i t t o Edinburgh, or round
the Inner C i r c l e . "Reggie" o f King's College i s
said t o have spent s e v e r a l days on a tube train a
couple o f years ago. Imperial College generally
has no Hags a t a l l
Except- B o n f i r e Night. Pour years ago the
I.C. Annual B o n f i r e was held on the road behind
the Albert H a l l . N a t u r a l l y enough, the road,
whioh i s made o f tarred wooden blocks, caught firm,
There was a memorable struggle with poliee and
firemen. Hose pipes f i g u r e d i n tugs o f war, and
were turned on the crowd. Eleven students were
c a r r i e d away i n Black Marias, and were fined.
I.C. was i n disgrace; th© A u t h o r i t i e s
clamped down. Any student arrested the following
bonfire night, was t o be sent down. A grave
President l a i d down the s e p u l c h r a l law i n funereal
tones. Wo had a quiet b o n f i r e on the Rector's
lawn (the then m a t e land opposite the Union), and
then wont en jaaaae t o P i o o a d l l l y , blocking the
roads, and l i f t i n g up oars. More grave Presidents
and we spent the f o l l o w i n g two years relatively
q u i e t l y a t Harlington.
Rags went out when the Income Tax went up;
when the wealthy could no longer send their sons
to College f o r fun. We have our occasional
l e t t i n g - o f f s o f steam, but they are not the real
t h i n g . Purgatory and the Army, and June examina-
tions are always too near.
S t i l l , things are not too bad. Morphy M y
i s r a c i n g towards us. B o n f i r e night i s almost
upon us, and looking a t FELIX, I note that three
years ago t h i n week one o f our students climbed
the A l b e r t Memorial and l e f t a red.lamp on top-
He was c a r r i e d awev, o f course.
In a Marie,
