The f i r s t shock came -when we inspected our beds. The
covers, we found, were o l d carpets, worn very thin and very
dirty. The 3heets were of a material resembling sugar
sacks and bore numerous dark stains whose origin we dared
not surmise. L i t t l e d i d we know that those coverlets
concealed the most hideous assortment of f i l t h y rags ever
3old by a TTkrainiaabeggar to a Chinese seaman for the
purpose of cleaning b o i l e r s . We deposited these rags
outaide the landlady''3 door, whence they disappeared over-
night. On subsequent days we likewise disposed of two
washstands, complete with jugs and basins, one beaded fire
screen, the remains of a draught screen, two tapestries in
bage gilded frames, one!hundred and f i f t y - f o u r old and -
d i r t y novel3, a cracked urn, a large sheet of asbestos, an
enormous spittoon and one small brass watering can.
Our anger rose further as we discovered the
nature of the chairs, the f i l t h beneath the ragged carpet's?
and the fact than the piano wa3 so out of tune as to be
unplayable. I t didn't help matters that the oriental
gentleman upstairs would f r y g a r l i c on the landing every
night. We relieved our rage by f i l l i n g the dear lady's
keyhole with f i s h , glue, putty, rag and a proprietary Jreast
extract.

The chance of inspection, so long deni <1 us, came one
morning v#ien, going up to pay the milk-man, 3he l e f t her
door unlocked. We peeped i n and by the dim light of her
s o l i t a r y can3.ie.and those rays f i l t e r i n g through the for-
gotten window at the end of the roam., we saw a mingled mass
of jaded treasures heaped against the mouldering walls.
Not one a r t i c l e was recognisable as furniture. Between
the p i l e s of rags, picture frames and chinaware meandered
a l i t t l e pathway towards the piece de resistance - a
large black b o i l e r . Cobwebs hung from every niche and the
smell of unwashed humanity and captive f e l i n i t y was over-
powering.
