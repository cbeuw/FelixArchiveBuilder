On Saturday f o r the f i r s t , t i m e i n i t s history, the
Rugby Club fielded s i x XV's. The results were a creditable
r e f l e c t i o n not only upon the keeness of the club members but
also on the club playing strength.
The f i r s t XV were the only unsuccessful side, but
t h e i r narrow defeat at the hands of Wasps Vandals team, d i d
them great credit. The forwards played v a l i a n t l y against
a heavier ami more experienced pack and the backs tackled
hard and relentlessly.
The second XT .beat Q.M.C. 2nd XV by 27 points to n i l .
The A XV. after a late cancellation and f i x t u r e rearrangement
which led to much confusion, won 12-0 and against Old
G-ranniarians and. the 3 r A and B XVs were winners by 9-0
and 16-3 respectively.
The dauntless 0 XV scored a resounding -victory by 15,
points to 14. The two praninant members of s t a f f belied
t h e i r ages with s p r i t e l y interpassing which completely
baffled the home team.

An early start was made t h i s season i n the Invitation
Sabin Cap f o r c l i n k e r eights. The race being held on the
Saturday after term started meant that, as usual, only a few
days t r a i n i n g could be enjoyed.
l a the f i r s t heat, the crew, starting badly due to f l o a t -
ing debris, found thesaaelves two lengths dam but. were w e l l
stroked to beat Westminster Hospital. Racing again almost
immediately a t i r e d I.C. eight lost to a very neat and
deservingI,en«buryorew.
Although t h i s aeans the loss of a pot whose only
v i r t u e was i t s capacity, with l a s t year's performances (see
Phoenix) and the keeness exhibited by t h i s year's Freshers
(God Bless them), the College loua-s forward to a outstand-
ing ?easoo.
