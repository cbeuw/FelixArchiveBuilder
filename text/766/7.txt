This year is a good one as far as
counting votes goes, as there are no
more than two people running for any
of the sabbatical posts. Although this
should make the voting easier too, it's
amazing how many people still
manage to cock the whole process up
and spoil their votes. This might
sound a trifle patronising, but from
my experience this year and last,
people still change their minds even
when only two candidates are
running, and ruin votes.
The STV (Single Transferable
Vote) system of marking the ballot
papers will be employed. This
involves putting numbers, beginning
with one (1) and ending (this year and
last) with two (2) (of course you don't
have to put a 2 down if you don't want
to.)
A student goes to vote
Student doesn't want to vote for A
candidate but prefers B candidate.
Candidate A
Candidate B 1
If student prefers A candidate to B
candidate
Candidate A 1
Candidate B
If you think the other candidate is a
good candidate but not as good as the
candidate you voted first for then put
a two (2) in their box
Candidate A
Candidate B 1
If it is a dead heat after the first count,
then the number of people who put
2's in will count, so that the majority
of people's wishes are accounted for.
Another legitimate, recognised
option is the abstention. To abstain
from the election the voter must write
"ABSTAIN" across the ballot paper.
This is the only spelling of the word
that will be accepted (it will be printed
on the ballot paper, so that's easy.)
Lots of people think abstaining is
ruining or spoiling a vote, this is not
so. If both candidates in your opinion
are 'real divs' then don't vote for
them and abstain. If enough people
feel the same way then they'll abstain
and if the amount of people who
abstain is more than the number of
valid votes cast for both candidates
then the election must be re-run from
the beginning ie papers go up again
so others can stand.
Do not write anything else on the
ballot paper other than that which has
been explained above. Ifyou do, your
vote will be totally disregarded.
Summary
1. Vote in order of preference using
numbers: 1,2.
2. Write "ABSTAIN" if both
candidates are unacceptable to you.
3. Bring your Union Card with you
or you won't be able to vote.
