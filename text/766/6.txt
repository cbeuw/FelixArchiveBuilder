The Inevitable Bit
When I became President a year ago.
I promised myself that I'd try and
increase the turnout for this year's
sabbatical elections. After several
weeks build-up and campaigning it
was really depressing that only 20%
or so of the electorate bothered to
vote. When there are so few-
candidates standing it's quite difficult
to drum up enthusiasm, but none the
less I fael compelled to try! So. please
vote on Monday and Tuesday in your
department...a Union sabbatical gets
free accommodation and £3.500 a
year on your behalf; and is expected
to speak for you on all sorts of issues.
If you don't vote, don't be surprised
if your representatives end up talking
rubbish on your behalf. If you're not
impressed with either candidate in an
election, you can register an
abstention. This is not the same as not
voting—you write 'ABSTAIN' on the
paper: and if abstentions outnumber
votes the election has to be re-run.
More Elections
ICU and its constituents aren't the
only ones holding elections at present.
The race is also on for the ULU posts
of President, Vice-president (services)
and Vice-president (finance and
adminstration). The elections are held
at the annual meeting of ULU's
General Union Council on which ICU
has nine voting representatives. If
anyone wants to find out more about
R o b e r t Daniel
I treasure the knowledge of my,
sexuality more than anything else in
my life (that's not to say that love and
friendship don't come a very close
second!) People I have met tend to
assume that they know everything
there is to know about homosexuals
simply because they understand that
we are attracted to members of our
own sex.
What saddens me is that many
people think that all there is to
heterosexuality is sleeping with a
member of the opposite sex. I feel that
heterosexuals have lost out in not
having had to explore their feelings
fully, as I have done.
Because lesbians and gay men are
born to heterosexual parents and in
a het-dominated society they do not
realise, their true feelings until the
onset of puberty and adolescent
yearnings for sexual experience.
At this age of about 14—19
heterosexuals and homosexuals split;
while heterosexuals continue along
the path already laid down for them,
homosexuals must try and decide
what they really feel inside. It was at
the candidates in these election, or to
talk to the nice GUC delegates about
which way their votes should go.
come to the Union Lounge today at
12.30pm. All the candidates have
been invited to a hustings meeting—
the usual format of short speeches and
questions will be followed. Everyone
welcome—GUC delegates please
come along.
AIDS Campaign
There's a meeting of ICU and
campus trades unions along with
College personnel and welfare staff,
next Tuesday lunchtime, to discuss a
co-ordinated. College-wide AIDS
information campaign. As AIDS is
something which affects us all, staff
and students, I hope we can organise
one campaign, effectively and
sensibly. If anyone's got brilliant
ideas for posters, leaflets or any other
campaign materials, come and see
me, before Tuesday if possible.
And Finally
I can't be the only one who's
longing to get away from Imperial
College for a while. If you're feeling
that way too, don't forget British
Rail's big discounts on 'Saver' fares
this month for railcard holders.
Tempting thought? I gather Roy
Harper's playing in the Lake District
next weekend...
Happy travelling,
Love, Christine.
this age that I first began noticing the
changes in my body, and beginning
to appreciate the graceful curves and
the exciting possibilities of developing
bulging muscles. Soon I began to
realise that there were many bodies
much more attractive than my own,
sleek and well developed upper
torso's abounded on a hot summers
day! This sounds very narcissistic,
and it is—but that's part of my
sexuality. Everyone has their own
unique sexuality; no two people are
attracted by exactly the same things.
I spent a year or so agonising about
whether or not I was 'queer'—no one
told me then that being gay is OK.
Another plus about being
homosexual—not that I'm recruiting
because either you are or you're
not—is that because we have to
discover most things for ourselves we
are not bound by the false morality
that blinds many heterosexuals. I'm
not suggesting that homosexuals
either are or should be promiscuous,
but that a society where people can
discuss anything openly and honestly

must be healthier than one where
'taboo' subjects are swept under the
carpet.
What I'm trying to say is that
everyone, in order to be happy within
themselves, must explore their
feelings and discuss things with
friends or relatives openly and
frankly—surely this is the place to
complete the transition from
adolescent to adult.
If you feel you might be gay or
lesbian and you need to talk to
someone, some useful phone numbers
are as follows:-
Lesbian and Gay
Switchboard-01-837 7324
Lesbian Line—Women only—
Mondays and Fridays 2—10pm
Tuesday to Thursday 7—10pm
-01-251 6911
Parents Enquiry—01-698 1815
These switchboards will have other
numbers and addresses to contact,
there is also Nightline on int. 6789.
The first two numbers are manned by
homosexual volunteers only, and may
be busy—keep trying.
The "Gay's the Word" bookshop
is also a good place to go—books like
"Out in the Open" are very useful if
you're just trying to come to terms
with your sexuality. Their address can
be obtained from the L / G
Switchboard, and also ask about the
opening hours for the general public.

Every hour of every day men, women
and children are being locked up,
incarcerated, enchained, beaten,
taunted, tortured. In Russia the recent
release of 140 dissidents pales amost
to insignificance beside the thousands
who remain behind bars. In Chile, in
China, in Syria, in Algeria, in
Turkey, in South Africa the situation
is hardly any different. We in Britain
can hardly imagine the fear of living
in a country where to speak your
mind, even among friends, is to court
imprisonment.
But Amnesty International exists to
try and bring the cases of unfortunate
prisoners of conscience to our
attention. And to those who say that
the goings on in foreign countries
have nothing to do with us, Amnesty
will answer, "Not true! And what's
more you can do something about it!"
In order to publicise the plight of
prisoners of conscience everywhere
IC Amnesty Group will incarcerate
itself in a concentration camp in the
JCR for 24 hrs on Thursday March
12th. So come along and give your
support. We'll also tell you more
about Amnesty and show you how
easy it is to write a letter so that you
too, with almost no effort, can help
Amnesty work.
If you can't make it on the day then
please sponsor any group member
who asks you—Amnesty's work can't
be done for nothing.
Remember, Amnesty International
works for the release of all political
prisoners who have neither advocated
nor used violence. It is totally
impartial in this effort. The
organisation also campaigns
unconditionally against torture and
capital punishment. And, Amnesty
works: since its beginnings more than
30,000 cases of prisoners have been
taken up; over 25,000 of these cases
are now closed. You can help too—
join us.
