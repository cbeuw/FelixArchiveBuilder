New JCR
approved
The plans to build a new JCR in the
same building as a new sports hall
have been provisionally approved by
Imperial College House Committee.
A proposal to support the scheme,
put forward by ICU President
Christine Taig was approved, pending
a feasibility study.
Ms Taig's paper also recommended
that ICU be compensated for any loss
in conference income resulting from
the presence of the QT Burger Bar in
the cufrent JCR. This was also
approved; Ms Taig and ICU Deputy
President Jackie Peirce will be
negotiating a sum with College
Secretary John Smith. This will be
included as part of the annual Union
subvention.
The U G M directive to pursue
•" Union control of the JCR bar was also
discussed. Mr Smith said that he
would prefer a profit share; the matter
was referred back to a special meeting
of House Committee.
Occupation
Ends
Students at the London School of
Economics ended their week long
occupation of Connaught House, the
school administration building on
Tuesday of this week. The
occupation, which was in protest
against the investment of more than
10 per cent of LSE's assets in
companies with South African links
ended peacefully after the schools
administration obtained a high court
injunction against the students.
The occupation was meticulously
organised, with cooking rotas,
cleaning rotas and security rotas.
Smoking and drinking were barred,
offices were opened up as study
rooms and separate dormitories
arranged for men and women. Pete
Wilcox, General Secretary of LSE
Students' Union told FELIX that the
occupation was for publicity
purposes, rather than to cause long
Boring Elections
The seven sabbatical candidates spoke
to an unpacked Great Hall at the
Hustings UGM yesterday. After a
short delay due to duplicating of
minutes, the usual reports were
accepted without question. Returning
Officer Dave Colley started the
Hustings but this was immediately
interupted by a procedural motion to
move to an emergency motion, both
proposed by Mark Cottle. This was
opposed by Dave Lowrie who then
called quorum when the procedural
motion was carried. A 'count'
revealed that there were 301 students
present making it quorate. The
emergency motion, which suggested
that the option of abstaining should
be allowed to be publicised, was
eventually passed.
The Returning Officer's report was
then continued with Bill Goodwin
being the first Presidential candidate
to speak. During this proposer Sarah
Allsop was abducted. Mr Goodwin
was forced to conclude the speech
himself. Ian Howgate then spoke and
the two candidates answered written
questions, during which Miss Allsop
was rescued.
The rest of the Hustings was very
boring.
...and More Boring Elections
The Royal College of Science Union
Top Five elections took place this
Monday in all RCS departments. Next
year's Executive will be Clare
McErlane (Physics) as President,-
Fiona Nicholas (Physics) as Vice
President and Gordon Brignal
(Physics) as Hon Sec. David Williams
(Physics) narrowly beat Julian Race
for the post of Honorary Junior
Treasurer. Both the posts of Hon Sec
and HJT were won within two votes.
Jackie Godfrey was returned
unopposed as Academic Affairs
Officer. President Simon Singh was
"very disappointed with the low turn
out," as the number of votes cast was
less than quorum.
term problems for the school, and as
such was a success. No doubt they
were also aware of the huge fine for
damages that landed on the Sussex
students at the end of their recent
occupation.
A spokesman for the school
promised that a meeting would be
held with the protestors in the next
few days. "We stand ready to talk
with the students, which was our
original intention before the
occupation," he said. The students
however say that they have been
listening to talk for the last eleven
years, and were optimistic that the
bad publicity would cause the school
to rethink their position.
Foxy
goings on
Last Tuesday lunchtime several
hundred people did not pack into the
Read Lecture Theatre to hear a talk
by Mr James Barrington of the
League against Cruel Sports. Mr
Barrington reviewed the arguments
against fox and cub hunting using
packs of hounds, saying that the
practice was unnecessary and
inhuman. He stressed that foxes were
only pests in lamb and free-range
poultry farming, which accounted for
less than 10% of the total agricultural
industry, and that numbers of foxes
were best controlled by environmental
factors such as territory size.
Several slides of hunts were shown,
demonstrating their brutal nature—
hounds are being trained by allowing
them to tear cubs to pieces, and the
digging out of foxes that have gone
to earth by sending down terriers to
fight them. Mr Barrington argued that
abolishing dog pack hunting,
including, for example, mink, deer
and hare hunting, need not result in
unemployment of hunt servants and
shooting of hounds (which are shot
half-way through their natural life
anyway) since artificially laid drag
trails could be used to give, in effect,
a bloodless hunt. Drag hunts would
also have the advantage of avoiding
valuable crops and domestic gardens
where there is a danger of household
pets being killed by hounds.
