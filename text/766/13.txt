This week, Thursday 12th, IC Film
Society presents the smash box office
hit of 86, Aliens in Mech. Eng. 220
(doors 7.30pm).
In the recent spate of sequels,
Aliens stands alone as the only
entertaining and different one I can
think of. Calling it a sequel to the
highly successful Alien is possibly
unfair, as it is more of an extension
of the story on a totally different line.
Sigourney Weaver, who was a
major part of what made Alien such
a classic, is the only surviving
character from the original. Again
Weaver steals the show giving a
performance of electrifying skill.
If you want to have a great night's
entertainment, then come along, you
won't be disappointed.
PS. Note Aliens is playing in Mech.
Eng. 220 not Physics LT1.

International Week—Greek Evening.
The IC Cypriot Society has
demonstrated that even small societies
can organize big events. The party on
Thursday, with attendance of over
300 people, was one of the best
parties of its kind. Lots of food,
drink, live music and Greek dancing
all in the 'Zorba' spirit as promised.
We thank all those who attended the
party an we hope next year we will
get even more University of London
societies together.

ICSF is pleased to announce that its
second, one day convention of 1987
will take place on Saturday 7th March
from 10am in the Union SCR and
Union Dining Hall. This will also be
the second WhoDay that SFSoc has
run.
Now some explanation for those of
you who don't have the faintest idea
what I'm on about. WhoDay is
SFSoc's T V science fiction
convention. Last year it was devoted
entirely to Dr Who and the good Time
Lord will certainly be heavily featured
this year. We will be snowing a
complete story from each of the 6
doctors (William Hartnell, Patrick
Troughton, Jon Pertwee, Tom Baker,
Peter Davidson and Colin Baker) and
W e l l ?
Although the term is drawing to a
close now, WellSoc is planning to go
out with a flourish rather than a
whimper. We've got one more
speaker meeting left, and then we
finish up with the Annual Dinner at
Luba's Bistro.
March 9th will see our AGM which
will be held at 7.30pm just before the
evenings lecture which will be given
by Martin S Taylor from the
Department of Computing. He is best
known for his extremely popular
"Hypnosis" lecture, but will be
talking about gambling. We don't
promise to make you into millionaires
overnight, but I did hear he'd
invented a method to win at
blackjack...Oh yes, the AGM. Papers
are up now (see Small Ads) and we
desperately need committee
members. Why don't you give it a
try?
The Annual Dinner details haven't
quite been finalised yet, but will have
been by the time you read this. If
you're interested in knowing more
contact Liz Tingley (Chem. Ill) or
Mark Oram (Biochem. II)—as places
are limited, tickets will be allocated
on a first-come first-served basis.

Well, it's been a very successful
weekend. Twenty students signed up
for the second course of this year and
spent Wednesday and Thursday
evenings doing ground training, and
on Saturday everyone got their first
jump. The weather was excellent and
the majority of the first timers got a
second jump as well. Ian Muriss
really got his money's worth and
made his jump last twenty minutes
longer than anyone else's—suspended
high up in a tree. He wanted to aovid
the runway, so ran straight down-
wind—into the tree. However he
wasn't discouraged and went up for
another jump.
We hope to see all the new comers
down at Headcorn for future jumps.
And don't forget your receipts.
As for the rest of us, when people
look like ants, you're alright but when
ants start looking like people, you're
in trouble.
For anyone else that's interested,
our meetings are on Tuesdays in the
Union Lounge.
Max Hunt von Herbing.
will have guests who have featured in
the programme. Nicolas Courtney,
who played the Brigadeer for many
years will be leading the list of Dr
Who guests. We will also be running
a parallel programme of other TV
Science Fiction of many different
types, including UFO, Space 1999,
Blake's 7, Randall & Hopkirk
(deceased). The Tomorrow People
and much more besides. We also have
a guest who spans most of TV Science
Fiction in many years of acting
experience, from Dr Who to Blake's
7, Space 1999 to Survivors. This is
Brian Blessed, whose fine
performances have featured in all of
these programmes.
So now you know what you are
doing next Saturday, WhoDay will be
open from 10am but come along at
any time. Guests will be appearing
after lunch, and the two video
programmes will be running
continuously. Take some time off,
and see some good escapist television.
You know it makes sense.

Yes, those DramSoc people are at
it again, hogging the Concert Hall, all
for the sake of 'Art' with a capital
'A'. The more observant reader will
have noted, with some apprehension,
the appearance of evil black posters
at strategic locations about College.
They announce the arrival at IC of
Strindberg's answer to the question
of "life the universe and
everything..."
Written towards the end of
Strindberg's life "The Ghost Sonata"
reflects the disillusionment of a lonely
dying man. This is no play for the
faint of heart. It is unremittingly
gloomy in outlook and yet, through
his language and symbolism,
Strindberg infuses it with a ghoulish
beauty. The end result is a piece of
theatre of the highest order, a play in
which mood is all. For the playwright
has set out to make us share his
despair, to experience his emotions
without the need to understand them.
We, the audience, are asked not to
pity him through the character of The
Old Man (Aidan Kershaw) but to feel
his pain. We are left unable to judge
the The Student (Miles Henderson) as
he turns to share the cynicism of the
elder generation.
"Ghost Sonata" is playing in the
Union Concert Hall from the 10th to
the 14th of March at 8pm. Tickets are
available from the Union Building,
Beit Quad, at lunchtimes all week and
in that Den of Iniquity—the DramSoc
storeroom.

QTSoc—Whv Day
As I sit here in the FELIX Office
contemplating this election madness
and writing an article no-one will read
for a club no-one cares about, I can't
even be bothered to ask myself why.
And the few who set out to climb the
mountain, dragging behind them the
weight of the superficial, reach the
summit to find futility. Whatever
happened to the dreams we dreamed
in the foothills—they were only
dreams. Death and the slow cancerous
death of the unthinking haunt me now
and I wonder...(I wa-.wa-wa-wa
wonder).. .and I laugh at the witicisms
which contrive to maintain my sanity.
Oh, to hell with it, why don't you
join me on Tuesday. The location—
the Union Bar—the event "Why
Day." Come and make merry—or
drown your deepest sorrows. I look
forward to your company.
Luks.
