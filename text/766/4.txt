Who are we
to judge?
Dear Dave,
Whenever a discussion on the
problems of South Africa arises it
results in a stream of correspondence.
I regret that I am continuing this trend
but some of the points raised in the
last weeks warrant a reply.
The focus of these letters has been
the so-called terrorist activities of the
ANC and they seem to imply that it
is per se a terrorist organisation. For
years, the ANC was an actively non-
violent organisation whose peaceful
protests were met with violence, and
•only after this did the ANC resort to
violence as a means of protest.
However, by no means are all of its
members terrorists, deserving to be
annihilated 'as efficiently as possible'
simply for being a member of the
ANC—as Mike Allen implied in his
letters. These too are innocent people
who deserve protection or would you
say that all members of the ANC are
terrorists? These people who are not
allowed freedom of speech in their
own country and have to seek refuge
in other countries are to be killed as
efficiently as possible. How can Mr
Allen sit on his butt in this country
and judge the actions of these
oppressed people? They have next to
no rights in their own country and
have fought patiently for the peaceful
reform which the white government
is now offering, as a gift, with
numerous conditions attached. What
moral right has a South African
government, which has committed
such atrocities as the killings of
peaceful demonstrators in Soweto in
1976, to insist that they will have no
discussions with the ANC until it
renounces violence? Also, what moral
Crossnumber
Mobius has presented me with
another of his tricky crossnumber
puzzles. Each square contains one
digit, none of which are zero. As
usual, there's a £5 prize for a
randomly selected correct solution
handed in before 1.00pm Wednesday
at the FELIX office. I normally try
and do a full page puzzle special at
the end of term, so if any of you know
any good problems that I could use
then please send them in, thanks.

right does this government have to
follow refugees into another country
and kill them, when it arbitrarily
enforces a state of emergency in their
own country and orders a news
blackout. Why must they have a news
blackout? WHAT A R E THEY
HIDING? Are they simply ushering
black protestors back into their homes
or are they killing people who are
relatively unarmed and unprotected?
The British government can sit here
and condemn Botha's actitivities until
they are blue in the face but what are
they doing to stop him or cause him
any substantial discomfort? They say
sanctions will reduce funds and slow
down the pace of reform but is it a
poor government that invades
surrounding countries to eliminate
relatively few people?
Some people use the argument that
under white management South
Africa is the richest country in Africa.
What other country has such cheap
labour that it can exploit with such
little regard for their safety and
fundamental human rights? In my
opinion, the making of money by
these means is totally amoral—the
Blacks work and live in appalling
conditions and the Whites enjoy the
profit. I agree that many African
countries are unstable but it is a
difficult process uniting people with
many religious and tribal
differences—a problem evident in the
conflict in Ireland. The good news is
that most of these countries are
working towards a better future for
all their peoples. In the system of
apartheid the non-white races in South
Africa don't have this chance.
There is one point on which I will
agree with Mike Allen. I found the
behaviour of the protestors outside Mr
Goosen's talk offensive and counter
productive. Offensive in the reverse
racism practised by the loud labelling
of some of the white people who
entered the room as racists. Counter
productive because they were
probably very well informed about
the facts and figures on South Africa
and could have asked very pointed

Of course, one of the most
informed people about the reforms in
South Africa will be Dennis Worrall,
the former South African Ambassador
to the UK who resigned his position
to contest the forthcoming elections
on a platform campaigning for faster
implementation of these reforms. I
sincerely hope that these peaceful
reforms are the way forward for
South Africa but the actions of the
present South African government do
not suggest that it will give the blacks
and coloureds in South Africa real
rights which will reflect the fact that
they are a majority and make the
South African economy what it is
today.
Yours sincerely.

It's a
depressing
world
Dear Dave,
Until I read FELIX last week I had
thought it would be forever dominated
by mindless bores regurgitating
pointless propoganda for outdated
political cliches. However, having
read the excellent article by notorious
berk Francis Miers I am confident that
sound philosophical thinking is
returning. I say drop the bomb,
oblivion now!

form writes a
letter
Dear Dave,
(Sounds like the Razzle letters
page, this). I wish to complain in the
strongest possible terms about the
slander which is being perpetrated
about me in the pages of FELIX. OK,
so I admit that most of it is true, but
I must register most vehemently my
disgust at being branded a hillman
imp owner; I wouldn't be seen dead
in such a prickmobile! I must now live
with this embarrassment for the rest
of my life. Since the article in
question appeared, I have been
harangued by drunks making farty
imp noises at me, and I have been
reduced to a figure of ridicule.
Yours faithfully,
J Ninety.
If the 'group of postgraduate civil
engineering students' contact the FELIX
Office (internal 3515), I will publish their
letter. Names can be withheld by request,
but I cannot include anonymous material.

Ratty Problems
This problem was more accessible to
analysis than the previous, similar, rat
problem, as most of you who entered
probably realised. The £5 prizewinner
was A J Perkins, Chem Eng 4, who
explained it quite well. The minimum
solution is 16 turns which can be seen
as follows. Other than the finishing
and starting squares there are 12 edge
squares to be visited and the path must
make a turn in each. Paths connecting
the edge squares that make no other
turns form three rectangles, and
moving from one to the other of these
rectangles takes two more moves.
Finally, to complete the path, you
have to turn off, and back onto, the
center diagonal. This makes sixteen
turns in all. Within this basic pattern
there are several actual paths that can
be followed, one is shown below.
Well done if you got it right.
