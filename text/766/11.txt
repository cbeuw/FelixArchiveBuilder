O p s o c
This year's OpSoc rag event is on
its way to you. In 1987 we are
presenting a non-stop sponsored
marathon for Rag of all the Gilbert
and Sullivan operettas (excepting their
first, Thespis, for which no music is
to be found on the face of the earth).
This should take around twenty-seven
hours and although some members
(myself included) will be trying to do
all of it, we don't want people to kill
themselves by doing too much (or fail
their degrees). The amount of time
spent, including both performance
and rehearsal, should not be more
than ten hours for even the longest
shows. If you aren't currently a
member for whatever reason, lack of
time or membership of ApSoc, please
come and sing for charity in any
shows you know (or even ones you
don't if you attend the rehearsal).
Reduced rate membership will be
Elisabeth Schwartzkopf not to
visit IC
available for the marathon and the rest
of the year. If you don't feel you can
give even ten hours to charity in an
event which should raise in the region
of two thousand pounds for Rag, then
please sponsor someone else.
