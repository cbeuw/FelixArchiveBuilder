Comedy can be a strange thing and
Vaclav Havel's latest, adapted by
Tom Stoppard, a fellow Czeck, is
somewhat less than normal. The
Orange Tree, Richmond, houses this
production on a stage of about 10' by
10' with the audience an arm's length
away.
The centre of the show is Dr
Leapold Kopria, played by Geoffrey
Beevers, a philosopher who has been
accused of 'intelligent hooliganism—
article 5.11.1' and so is forced to wait
for the inevitable knock on the door.
Mistresses, friends and supporters
drop in, aiming to bolster his
confidence, but merely create an
insane atmosphere of repetition.
There is a strong feeling of 'them' and
'us', although we never find out who
'they' are or where 'there' actually
is—all very reminiscent of Kafka's
The Trial—and we quickly wonder
who it is that's actually mad.
Mr Beevers' performance is
certainly that of a character slightly
unhinged, terrible nervousness, his
preocupation with the doorbell and
manic pill popping. Time and time
again we hear lines repeated, by
different characters, and the second
half is almost a mirror image of the
first, although not quite. The
incessant repetitions soon show Dr
Kopria's life for what it is, yet we
wonder whether perhaps we are the
root of the insanity and maybe he's
just an innocent victim of society's
introspective view of philosophers.
The comic elements are masterly
played, or perhaps the audience's
laughter is pure relief—anyway we
laugh, the millworkers proving that
timing makes comedy. As a whole
show it is entertaining although as a
millworker aptly states "someone's
got to be sensible," yes, but who?

Pink P e g S l a x
Today sees the welcome return of
Leeds' band Pink Peg Slax to
Imperial. Since they were here last
year, when most people missed them,
they have had several Radio One
sessions and recently an appearance
on The Tube. Their brand of Rock 'n'
Roll with tongue firmly planted in the
cheek is more fun than a maths
tutorial, and provides more laughs
than a cruise on the Titanic. The party
is being held jointly with Richmond
College, and support is provided by
College's lovable psychobillies Dave
Puppy and the Happy Dogs. If you
have shied away from College gigs
because you've never heard of the
band, you owe it to yourself to break
with tradition. Doors open at 8.00pm
and the whole shebang takes place in
the Union Lounge (tickets £1.50). See
you there—Yee Hah!

E v o l u t i o n f r o m S p a c e
The concept of 'spontaneous
generation'—the idea that organisms
originate from basic material such as
earth and water—persisted from
Aristotle (384 to 322 BC) right up
until the mid 19th Century. This
belief persisted even in the face of
experiments such as the one
conducted by the Italian physician
Francesco Redi in 1668 in which he
demonstrated that maggots would not
form in meat if flies were kept away
from it. It was Louis Pasteur who
finally delivered the coup de grace to
the spontaneous generation doctrine
with a series of cleverly designed and
decisive experiments.
But this does not explain the origin
of life—the actual instant when life
can be said to have 'occurred' or
'come about'. The generally accepted
theory is that the formation of the
molecules essential to life—the DNA
molecule, able to replicate itself,
enzymes capable of catalysing
reactions at a rate far faster than they
naturally proceed—came about as a
random event, occurring in what is
rather loosely referred to as 'the
primordial soup'. This theory would
seem to have been confirmed by
various experiments, an account of
which can be found in Carl Sagan's
excellent book Cosmos.
In Evolutionfrom Space the authors
Fred Hoyle and Chandra
Wickramasinghe reject the idea that
life originated on Earth, and back up
their alternative theory with some
convincing evidence.
Enzymes are proteins with highly
complex structures that can be split
into at least three levels. Hoyle and
Wickramasinghe invite the reader to
consider the probabilities involved in
the random evolution of even simple
enzymes. The total probability for
obtaining a working enzyme—and a
small one at that—comes out as one
part in IE+ 20. And when we face the
fact that there are about two thousand
known enzymes, the probabilities
become truly vast.
The authors also point to histones
as evidence of the general
improbability of life. Histones are
proteins which help to pack the DNA
complement of an organism into the
nucleus—no mean feat when you
consider that the DNA of one human
chromosome is 5 cms long. Histones
are one of the most highly conserved
proteins known—over the whole of
the plant and animal kingdoms the
amino acid order of the histones of
vaious organisms is remarkably
invariant. The probability of
randomly deriving the simplest
histone is even smaller than for
enzymes.
In short the authors argue that life
is simply too improbable to have
originated on Earth.
Hoyle and Wickramasinghe don't
stop here; they go on to point out
many other discrepancies in the
generally accepted view of things.
Many bacteria can withstand doses of
X-rays millions of times greater than
they would ever be exposed to in the
course of normal life on Earth. (This
point becomes of great importance
later on). Many insects respond to
wavelengths of light not found on the
surface of the Earth. Why were these
capabilities ever developed! If it was
in response to conditions that existed
many millions of years ago, why are
those capabilities still in existance,
with no selection pressure to keep
them going? In addition, the fossil
records of Earth, if examined, show
that evolution on Earth took place in
relatively large strides. This is exactly
what Darwinian evolution does not
account for. There is no evidence for
a gradual change in the organisms of
the planet.
Having knocked out Darwin, Hoyle
and Wickramasinghe present their
own hypothesis; if life is too
improbable to have originated on the
Earth, because the numbers are
astronomical, then might not the
solution also be astronomical? Could
the DNA which started life on Earth
arrived from off the planet, in the
form of virion (virus particle) or even
in a dormant cell? Calculations
certainly show that such particles are
the right size to be accelerated by
radiation from stars; many bacteria
and viruses are indeed the ideal
size—between one tenth of a micron
and 3 microns. If this is the case then
it would certainly explain the
resistance of bacteria to mutation by
X-rays. Bacteria can also survive the
extremely low temperatures of space,
and the almost zero pressure.
Propelled by light a virus particle
could attain speeds of the order of
thousands of kilometres a second. At
typical re-entry velocities of 40 km
per second there is a maximum
diameter of up to one micrometre
which would not burn up. This
maximum diameter admits viroids,
viruses and most bacteria.
Evolutionfrom Space is not a book
which can be dismissed lightly as the
work of cranks. Both the authors are
highly regarded scientists; Sir Fred
Hoyle has received worldwide
acclaim for his contribution to
astronomy, and Professor Chandra
Wickramasinghe is a leading
authority on interstellar matter. This
review really does the book injustice,
summarising in a few paragraphs
what really needs chapters to fully
explain. The ideas that abound in
Evolution from Space are not wildly
thown out, but carefully reasoned and
presented with the appropriate
evidence. The conclusions drawn are
unwelcome—they go against the grain
of what we have been taught in school
and by textbooks.
Evolution from Space is a
fascinating read. And before you
dismiss it, remember that the true
essence of 'scientific method' is
moving in the direction in which the
evidence and Nature points, no matter
how unwelcome from a human point
of view that direction may seem.
Evolutionfrom Space, by Sir Fred
Hoyle and Professor Chandra
Wickramasinghe is a Palladin Book,
published by Granada in paperback,
costing £1.95.
