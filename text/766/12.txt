Sixes
Football
Sunday 1st March
It was Sunday, and the day that
everyone had been waiting for had
arrived; the day of the RCS sixes at
Harlington—the most prestigious
tournament since the last World Cup!
12 teams of brilliant fooballers lined
up for battle.
IC IVs started their campaign with
a tough match against Selkirk A.

Before Selkirk had even touched the
ball however, Batstone planted it
firmly in the net. In the end Selkirk
can feel lucky to have only conceded
6 as Batstone scored five times and
Greenwood added another. 6-0 to IC
IVs. A game against 22 Drinking
Club ended in a rather lucky 2-1 win
for the IVs with Batstone and Prior
scoring. The final game of the group
was against Southwell House, led
galliantly by the grit of Parkin and the
skill of Coneybeare. Southwell scored
first but the IVs equalised thanks to
a thundering header from
Greenwood. 1-1 the final score.
The next round was again in the
form of groups and IC were paired
with Physical Chemistry and a team
from the 1st XI. A goal for Physical
Chemistry early on in the game saw
the IVs looking ragged but a
tremendous drive from Morris and a
run and shot by Greenwood sealed a
2-1 win for the IV XI. Next game was
a tough one against the IC 1 st XI but
even they couldn't stop the scoring
power of Batstone. The IVs played
with an air of superiority and two

Saturday February 28th saw the IC
sailing team take to the water at our
home reservoir for a series of races
against Bristol, Bristol ladies.

With Imperial's recent run of
success, 10 wins in the last 12
matches, prospects for next year are
looking good; future opponents
beware!

goals from Batstone saw the IV eleven
team get to the final. The IC 1 sts were
well beaten. Inorganic Chemistry
were the other finalists. IC dominated
the early exchanges but missed
several easy chances. However, in the
second half Batstone sealed a superb
victory with a well taken goal. IC IVs
were champions! Thanks to Paul
Savage for organisation. A mention
must also be given to the Inorganic
Chemistry goalkeeper Simon
Anderson, who after good
goalkeeping, unfortunately fractured
his shinbone in the final.
Hockey
IC 1st XI 10, LSE 0
IC maintained their top of the table
position with one of their best displays
of the season, against a middle of the
table LSE side.
Attacking straight from the start,
the team went 2-0 up in the first five
minutes with goals from Nick Collie
and Phil Oliver. Half-time saw the
lead increased to 3-0 with Imperial
controlling the midfield through Paul
Coleman, Nick Collie, Justin
Brooking and tireless running from
Mark Lewis.
The second half started slowly with
Imperial consolidating their lead until
the last twenty minutes of the game,
when the superior fitness and stamina
of the Imperial forwards resulted in
an avalanche of goals. An excellent
team effort reached its climax when
the left back, Alan Newman, showing
devastating speed and agility wrong-
footed the defence to score in the
dying seconds of the game.
Scorers: P Henharen (3),
N Collie (2), P Coleman (2),
P Oliver (1), H Vamdevhan (1),
A Newman (I).
Big Ripples
Rowing
Saturday 28th Feb
University of London
Head
Imperial College won the University
of London Head last Saturday.
Imperial College came second.
Imperial College came third. Imperial
College only entered three eights—
they are not greedy.
The Head is an annual race for
eights from constituent colleges of
London University. This is rowing's
equivalent of the Gutteridge Cup. The
other colleges must have felt rather
overwhelmed by IC. Our first eight
finished almost two minutes faster
than University College, the fourth
fastest crew. Rowing at Imperial is in
a different league. This is not to
diminish the achievement; it was quite
remarkable by any standards.
Over the past few years the boat
club has grown in size and gathered
prestige. There is no doubt that IC
ranks as the top college in London for
rowing; the question is now how
Imperial compares with other
universities. IC can be counted among
the country's top six rowing
universities, with Oxford,
Cambridge, London, Durham and
Reading.
It is interesting to speculate on
which of these is the best. The
question is not merely of academic
interest. Channel Four is thought to
be evaluating the possibility of an
"Alternative Boat-Race." This race
would be between the fastest
university and the fastest club crew
in the country. The race is still very
much on the drawing board, but is
already making big ripples in the
rowing world.
There is as yet no competition to
establish which is the fastest
university crew. The Oxford-
Cambridge boatrace takes place on
28th March (12.55pm). For the first
time in history the main spring event
for eights—the "Tideway Head"—
will take place on the same day
(3.45pm). Over four hundred crews,
several from abroad, will compete on
the same stretch of water as the
Boatrace. Imperial will be racing
along with the best clubs and
universities, other than Oxford and
Cambridge. IC should perform well.
It would be a remarkable result if
Imperial College could beat some of
the big names, indeed it is premature
to suggest that Imperial could pull off
any major upset. But IC's gathering
strength will be a force to be reckoned
with in years to come, as our growing
reputation attracts some of the best
junior oarsmen.
