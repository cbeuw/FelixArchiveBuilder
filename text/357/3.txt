The 181st meeting of
I C U Council was held on
17th March, 1974 at the
College Field Station, Sil-
wood Park.
Correspondence
A reply regarding Miss
George at SOA S had been
received. It was agreed that
no further action should
be taken till her academic
future had been settled.
Information from the
Student Publications Space
Agency was circulated (re-
ferring to the selling of
advertising space in stud-
ent publications). The sec-
retary agreed to circulate
this to the various hand-
book editors.
Next year's Publicity
Officer and Hon. Secretary
would be asked to attend
the NUS Journalists' con-
ference at Easter.
President's Report
There was considerable
discussion on whether the
Felix / Publicity Officer
should be an observer or
full member of Council. It
was finally agreed that
"He shall be required to
attend Council meetings as
an observer".
It was reported that the
French students' visit was
successful and that a re-
turn journey will be organ-
ised.
The college have agreed
to purchase printing and
subsidiary equipment for
the production of Felix.
This would be offset litho
equipment, folders, cutters
and veri-typewriters. Ini-
tially this would be solely
for Felix, but the blue-
book, handbooks and rag-
mag could also be pro-
duced. It would be used
solely by trained officers,
hired for the job.
There was a verbal re-
port on the manning and
operation of Nightline.
The proposal that there
should be a Student Officer
for Nightline, along the
lines of an I C U sabbatical,
term were accepted (Felix
to appear on the 2nd, 4th
and 7th Tuesdays of term).
Council also mandated the
incoming Publications Offi-
cer, M r . Williams, to pro-
duce one issue of Felix a
month in August and Sep-
tember, these to be mainly
directed towards postgrad-
uate news.
The election of the
I G P G G A O would take
place at the earliest oppor-
tunity.
COUNCIL
REPORT
was accepted. This to be
jointly financed by I C U
and the other major col-
leges involved. (QEC and
Chelsea).
Hon. See's Report
The results of the num-
erous elections held were
presented.
Mr. Spencer and Mr.
Simmons had resigned as
next and this year's SCAB
chairmen respectively. Mr.
Starkey offered to stand as
acting chairman and to
produce a report on the
difficulties existing within
SCAB.
Mr. Wadsworth's rec-
ommendations regarding
Felix for the summer
Deputy President's Report
Regarding the closure of
the Union during the vaca-
tion, this, and the appoint-
ment of duty officers,
would be at the discretion
of the executive. M r . Sin-
clair was asked to ensure
that examination dates did
not clash with duty offi-
cers' lists for the coming
term.
Finance
Mappin and Webb had
quoted a price of £10 per
pot for 100 pewter tank-
ards. Present price is about
£14. Council endorsed its
earlier decision of 4.2.74 to
buy these.
The financial estimates
for 1974-75 were carefully
considered. After some
alterations they were ap-
proved as being fit for sub-
mission to the college as
the official estimates.
Other Reports
IC Floor Reps Commit-
tee's recommendation on
the setting up of a debat-
ing society was accepted.
It was agreed that three
people should attend the
next meeting of U L U
council.
Mr. Amor presented an
Entertainments re p o r t .
There was a discussion on
the possibility of them
paying for the use of the
Great Hall to cover the
extra wear and tear. On a
vote this was decided
against.
Union Management
Mr. Sayler presented his
report and it was accepted
in principle. This would
mean that three sub-man-
agers (one for office staff
and printing unit, one for
refectory, bar and shop
and one for bookshop)
would form a committee
with the president, hon.
secretary, three council
members and a member of
the college financial sec-
tion. They should report
and be responsible to
Council. (Full copies of
the report are available
from the Union Office),
This constitutes a sum-
mary of the proceedings,
derived from the, as yet,
unratified minutes.
STUDENT JOURNALIST CONF
8th—llth April 1974
The conference was for
students interested in news-
papers and handbooks and
dealt with most matters in
a rather general way.
The first talk of the con-
ference was from Brian
Jones, Northern Editor of
The Guardian. He spent
most of his time criticising
the layout of the student
newspapers he had in front
of him (not Felix). The
main points he made were
(1) to keep the typefaces
uniform (2) not to over-
print in colour (3) and to
put fillers in at the bottom
of the page, not halfway
down.
Next was supposed to be
a practical session. We
were put into groups and
told to produce a news
sheet (two sides of A4) on
six topics which we could
get the details on by brib-
ing the Salford exec. Most
(at Salford University)
groups decided that this
was rather silly, more fit-
ted to a school project
group than to a NUS
conference. Eventually
three out of 10 papers
appeared.
Later we met Peter
Barnes from the Daily
Mirror who spoke about
photo-journalism. This
was not very relevant to
student newspapers.
There was a report back
f r o m t h e Advertising
Agency Working Party.
Apparently last year's con-
ference set up this party,
and a feasibility study was
to have been made. Pre-
dictably, nothing had come
of this, and it was more
or less decided to set up
another working party,
and to have a new report
drawn up. We could then
provide similar services to
Dominion Press and JEP
and can make them avail-
able for all students. This
agency would initially deal
with handbooks, then ex-
tend to newspapers.
A talk on Business and
Management followed.
This was rather uninspir-
ing, and would have been
better directed at someone
trying to sell a book.
A man from A . B. Dick
printers spoke about print-
ing methods, mainly litho.
He dealt with the different
plates that can be used,
their suitability and cost.
We were then given the
'Report back from the
Student Press Agency
Working Party'. The gen-
eral idea is to set up a cen-
tral office to collect all
student newspapers and
gather together main news
items to send out to all
student papers. The NUS
exec, seemed more inter-
ested in this thaa anyone
else, but it was agreed to
set up a new working
party.
The best talk of the con-
ference was from Letraset.
It included films, slides
and handouts of free
samples, walleharts, etc.
The only other lecture
of any interest was on stu-
dent broadcasting. A girl
from Essex University
Radio told us about the
timetable of their station.
Altogether the confer-
ence was well worth at-
tending, especially: for
those like myself who had
little prior knowledge on
the subjects discussed.
If anyone wishes to find
out more about any of
these topics I will be quite
willing to discuss them in
detail with those people.

NUS CONF
Once again this Easter
the ritual "NUS Confer-
ence" occurred. And once
again the politicians of to-
morrow met to practice
their talents and try to get
their names in the Daily
Tetlegraph. It was esti-
mated that the delegates
split roughly into three
groups—340 million com-
munists, international
marxists, maoists, revolu-
tionary socialists, and
other moderate organisa-
tions; three unaligned and
two conservatives.
"The moderates suffered
outset. Stuart Apall, 57,
failed in his bid for Presi-
dency of the Union, and
this he blamed on the
Conservative faction of
the conference. One dele-
gate, Cedric Foreskin, 94,
told me it was a victory
for common sense and he
hoped there would be no
recurrence of such mis-
carriages of justice.
Probably the most con-
troversial decision of the
conference was to prevent
fascists from speaking at
Universities by violent or
murderous methods. I
spoke to our own Trevor
Philpott about this deci-
sion and asked him if he
saw the removal of the
freedom of speech as
something of a fascist pol-
icy itself. Mr. Philpott,
replied that he had voted
for the motion because
fascist speakers cause vio-
lence and, since there are
no intellectuals at Univer-
sities, no useful discussions
could take place. Mr.
Philpdtt went on: "Tfie
Conservative Society never
ask me to speak at their
meetings—or any of my
friends like Mr. McGoo-
hay, Jimmy Red or J. Star-
Iynne. I think freedom of
speech should apply only
when people say the right
things". When questioned
more generally about the
conference Mr. Philpott
recounted that "some of
the birds were quite nice".
Mr. Philpott is 13.
I asked a fresher, Cyn-
tia Smegma, f o r h e r
impressions of the confer-
ence. She replied: "Before
I came here I thought
motions were something to
do with Crapping. Now I
know!".
Can you
speak
Enali
Some people can't. In
fact, an estimated 60- per
cent of the world's popu-
lation can't. And an esti-
mated 2 per cent of the
student population of Im-
perial College have diffi-
culties with the language.
This year, 90 overseas
students were taking Eng-
lish classes in college
during the first term. Per-
haps half of these found
language a severe handicap
to their academfc «nd
social life. We can guess
Black & White
or
Chrome and
Crimson
Tenacious black and
white poster makers are
rife on the campus. Don't
you think that posters in
heavy lettering punctuated
with blotches and unin-
spiring sketches makes
even the most extraordin-
ary event seem average if
not a little bit dull?
You always notice the
coloured posters. Last
term there was an increase
in the number of coloured
posters around the place.
This new term I've posted
yellow flowers in lots of
places.
These prints were pro-
duced in the Graffitti
workshop (alias . . . SCC
room). There are forty
people who design and
screen print. Anybody can
join GraffittL It requires
no previous experience
and no special skills. Real
expertise is gained by try-
ing and1
a Mttle practice.
The techniques are so
simple . . . after designing,
stencils are cut from
greaseproof paper, though
you can use a commercial-
ly produced (1200 per cent
more expensive) plastic
film. Alt' the posters made
to date used this method.
Printing is straightforward,
so imagination (that's
when you use your brain)
is only required when
designing.
Professional screen pro-
cess is largely photograph-
ic which simplifies and
widens the scope of
design enormously. Colour
and half tone separation is
normal practice.
With a bit of luck, when
funds become available we
will be able to reproduce
photographs and sketch
drawings.
If anyone wants a beau-
tiful, coloured poster made
at about IOp per copy then
they should contact Graf-
fitti. For society there are
a few illuminations . . . a
minimum of 20 copies and
a max. of 100 . . . the max-
imum size is 20 x 30 the
smallest is half A4, which
is suitable for party invi-
tations . . . two or three
colours is normal.
Soon, maybe, even this
term, we will be screening
motifs on to T-shirts and
sweat shirts at bargain
prices.
If you would like to
join us or order a poster
for an event this term or
for freshers fair next year
or just a chat, personal
attention will be given by

that there were others who
never found the classes
(details are available from
Mr. C. K. MacDowell, ad-
viser to overseas students,
College Block 331),
That students should
have such handicaps is not
advisable; one might even
call it ludicrous, inadmis-
sible, orj to quote a mem-
ber of the Board of
Studies, immoral. Clearly,
students should have a
sufficient mastery of the
English language before
embarking on a highly de-
manding course of study.
Those without such ability
should obtain it before
entering college.
Proposals
The subject has been
discussed at length by the
College Committee on
Overseas Students, which
intends to make the follow-
ing recommendations to
the Board of Studies:
1. That prospective stu-
dents who have not had
English as the language of
instruction for some part
of their education should
take an examination in
September immediately be-
fore joining college. The
examination would be set
by the college, compulsory,
and taken in London.
2. ' That a th ree months
course in English be made
available preceding the
examination for those that
want it. Financial help for
privately financed students
who wish to fake this
course is ateo being con-
sidered.
Other alternatives are:
1. Bring back English
language 'O' level or equi-
valent as an entrance
requirement. This has ob-
vious disadvantages, in
that such examinations are
not taken in a number of
countries.
2. Use the British Coun-
cil test or the American
Test of English as a For-
eign Language (TOEFL
test). However, the British
Council test is subject to
political misuse, and the
timing of the T O E F L test
makes it impracticable.
3. Do nothing and allow
students to continue to
come and struggle with the
language.
4. ??? If you have a
better idea, S A Y SO!
Questionnaire
The Union Overseas
Students Committee is
eager to assess the situa-
tion as quantitatively as
possible, and to find the
opinions of students on
this question. To this end,
a Questionnaire is now be-
ing sent out to all overseas
students. So please, if you
are an overseas student,
fill it in and return it, com-
plete with your comments
and ideas, as soon as pos-
sible. Its for US, NOW, to
determine what happens to
future students. If you
care, please co-operate.
We look forward to hear-
ing from, you,
Ida Glaser Physics P G
