PURPLE PATCH:
Firstly, I muslt say ithat although this patch is rather
long, each individual part is equally as important as
the others. It is divided into sub-headings, all of which
are linked and should be Of interest to most of you.
NUS Insurance/Travel Office
As many of you will know, Ithis "office" has been
behind a counter in the Room at ithe Top for Ithe past
two years, and before then was behind a desk in the
Junior Common Room, College Block. The reason it
was moved to Room at the Top was as a focal point
for a room destined to be the cenltre of activity on an
open-plan scheme.
As it happened, there was no security on R A T T ,
and consequently all the information/office equipment
was regularly destroyed or ait the least tampered with
by elements of our student intelligentsia.
The only other people to use R A T T , were the Stu-
dent Councillor, Ents for meetings, and a very few
people for evening meetings. As such the area was
being greatly wasted in use, and it was felt, could be
better used for other purposes. Consequently, N U S
Insurance/Travel have moved into the old Committee
Room off the lower lounge, and the required work in
this room should now be completed. It is hoped that
the office will now be in easy reach of students and
that you will make use of their excellent opportunities
for saving money.
Room at the Top
As I have just mentioned, the R A T T is Ito be used
for other business than merely NUS Travel/Insurance.
The plan which you see on this page is an outline of
what alterations will take place, and it is hoped that
you Will make full use of the new room.
A C C , R C C , and SCC will make use of the three
rooms on the North side of the R A T T , and S C A B
(Ents, Folk, OpSoc, etc.) will use the large room on
the South side and the Student Councillor the small
room.
Alterations should be complete by nexlt October, and
I would think that nexlt year's Deputy President will
give full instructions as to the use of the room.
Printing Unit
Over the past two terms we have been investigating
the possibility of reducing the cost of Felix (at present
about £130 per issue!!). "Not too difficult" you may
say "merely go to a cheaper printers". But it is not
that easy, we are now dealing with the cheapest prin-
ters, so where do we go?
What we are doing is Ito move over to printing
Felix on offset litho. This involves a vast capital
outlay for machines (£8,000) and paper (£20,000), but
gives us the chance of reducing the cost of Felix to
about £30 per week. The college have agreed to pay
the entire of the capital, and the equipment and paper
has now been ordered, and should be installed by July
of this year.
The printing room will be behind a partition in the
present Upper Lounge (next to the Felix office) and
must, as I am sure you appreciate, be out of bounds
to students. We will be employing our own typist and
machine operator for the Unit, and thus will be com-
pletely self-contained.
On the machines, we will be printing Felix, Phoenix,
Rag mag, U S K Handbook, Blue book, Union diary,
Societies Handbook, and maybe some College publica-
tions. IT W I L L N O T B E POSSIBLE F O R SOCIE-
TIES O R INDIVIDUALS T O H A V E B U M P H

The person in the Union ito speak to about these
machines is myself this year, and Mike Williams
(Publicity Officer) next year.

PLANS FOR ROOM AT THE TOP
ESSEX. And now to get on the final item of the
report dealing with the scrappy piece of junk which
was put out by the Communist Parity last week about
the events at Essex University. Although they cannot
help being biased in what they write I feel some of
their comments are totally unjustified, and that" we
should look at the Essex University situation in the
grimmest light possible. The events at Essex Univer-
sity began by a group of left Wing militants occupying
part of the administration block "as their act of sup-
port for the Grants campaign". During this occupa-
tion 36 students were charged with attempting Ito stop
lectures and generally cause a disruption. These 36
students, it seems, are probably Ithe more political
element of the Students Union and as such it is felt
that they have been victimised against. After the occu-
pation three of these 36 students were expelled from
the College and arising from this a group of people
decided Ithat their expulsion was unjustified and that
they would picket the College in order to try and
reverse the decision.
No-one can condone the actions of Vice Chancellor
Sloman, but at the same time no-one can condone
the actions of the students. From Ithe position of a
very unmilitant College we can see quite clearly that
the militancy which has occurred at Essex has done
absolutely nothing for the Grants Campaign, nothing
for the three students who were expelled and less than
nothing for the students' image as a whole. I believe,
as I am sure many other students believe, that the
action of the militant students from Essex and also
the droves (less than 100) of militants from outside
Essex is not representative of the student body as a
whole and not even representative of the majority of
students at Essex University. This has been more than
adequately shown by the amounts of "mass support"
that has been mobilised. Only a few dozen Essex
students spent their holidays manning the "picket
lines" during the Easter vacation, and only 200 of
ithem attended the picket on 24/4/74 (last week). This
is out of a total of 2,100 students on what is a
campus type university (i.e. majority living in). Also,
only 500 (out of a total membership of 660,000) stu-
dents actually attended the demo last week.
You may have seen in the Communist Party bumph
sheet that the Executive sent a letter to Essex Uni-
versity condemning the actions of the students. This
letter was sent as an expression of ithe ideas outlined
above in order to try and show that not all students
believe that militancy is the only way to success. Also,
in the communist bumph sheet it is indicated that
Felix has been taken over by the Executive, i.e. that
it has now become a biased and bigoted newspaper.
This is an absolute load of bullshit. 90% or more
of the articles in Felix are submitted by individual per-
sons or clubs and are merely set out in the news-
paper by Mr. Wadsworth. If it had been taken over by
the Exec then surely this would not be so. As for the
statement in the bumph sheet that negotiation is not
the way ito success this top, I believe, is false. A great
deal of negotiation has gone on in this college over
the past few years and I don't think anyone of us can
grumble at the deal which we are getting, i.e. Hall
Rents — the lowest in the country and almost static
for the past three years; Refectory prices are the lowest
throughout London, this year's increase being approx-
imately one-fifth of that experienced at L S E ; the
Union Grant from the L E A s being approximately
£26,000 and our subvention from the College a fur-
ther £20,000 plus £48,000 for welfare, health and
sports facilities; and £80,000 extra this year spent by
the College on items which the Union has requested—
such as printing equipment, paper, improvements and
modifications to Union premises. We have a situation
here where the Union and the College can work to-
gether and I feel that it is only the Union who could
pull out of this cost and this the College most cer-
tainly does not want.
I will leave it up to you as an individual to judge
the events at Essex. The above is the feeling of the
Executive and as such we feel it would be the opinion
of the majority of students at IC, although anyone of
us would be only too delighted to discuss the issue
with you if your views are different to ours.

equally so ill-health can
affect the terms of Life
Assurance in the future.
In some instances occupa-
tion, overseas travel, and
hazardous sports or pas-
times can substantially
affect the cost of life as-
surance. Advice taken
early in life is therefore
invaluable and can pay
big dividends in the
future, so come and see

SCAB MANIFESTO
This Thursday lunch-
time there's a Union
Meeting in Ithe Great
Hall, at which you'll be
electing nexlt year's SCAB
Chairman/Social Sec. In
the next few lines I'd like
to tell you why I'm stan-
ding for that post, and to
urge you to' vote for me
in that election.
Firstly let me outline
my idea of the job of
SCAB Chairman. He
should
1 Optimise the standard,
range and quantity of
Entertainments provi-
ded by IC Union.
2 Get the maximum co-
. operation possible be-
tween SCAB Organis-
ations for the benefit
of IC Students.
3 Maintain and improve
this year's good rela-
tions between SCAB
and College.
4 Represent and safe-
guard the interests of
SCAB organisations on
Council.
Now let me tell you
what I've done this year
and why 1 think it will
enable me to carry out
all the above duties effec-
tively and to the full. This
year I've worked on the
Ents committee, giving
me an up to date know-
ledge of the problems in-
volved in putting on big
money events at IC. I've
also worked on Linstead
Disco which has given me
a good idea of how the
smaller SCAB organisa-
tions function. This ex-
perience will be of inval-
uable help in carrying out
1 and 2.
I've also been involved
in producing and presen-
ting a fortnightly discus-
sion programme on
STOIC. Ability gained in
chairing these discussions
will enable me to chair
S C A B effectively and un-
biasly. Organisational ex-
perience in producing
these programmes and in
successfully obtaining
support for a Campus
Radio Station at IC, will
prove of immense assis-
tance in carrying out all
of the duties of SCAB
chairman to the full.
But doesn't the job of
Social Sec require some
secretarial experience ?
NO, Mike Simmons this
years Social Sec (resigned
—Ed) says that the job
requires absolutely no
secretarial experience.
Even so haven't I got
enough on my plate with-
out taking on more?
No, all that I shall be
doing next year outside
academic work, will be
IC Radio and, if elected,
the job of SCAB chair-
man. If not elected, I will
continue to work with
Ents and help seit up IC
Radio. As far as STOIC
is concerned, I have al-
ready told both this year's
and next year's Chair-
man, that I will be doing
no work for STOIC after
July 1st, 1974.
In addition to carrying
out the duties of SCAB
Chairman I would also
encourage
1 A l l SCAB organisa-
tions to be more ambi-
tious in what they pre-
sent (particularly C C U
Ents).
2 A diversification of all
entertainments to cater
for all tastes.
3 The development of
lunchtime entertain-
ment, as Started this
year by Operatic Soci-
ety.
Well I hope that's con-
vinced you that I'm the
right man for the job. I'm
standing because I believe
I can carry out the duties
of SCAB chairman/Social
Sec and improve enter-
tainments here alt IC bet-
ter than any of the other
candidates standing. So
come along and vote for
me this Thursday, 1 p.m.
Thanks for listening.
Clive Dewey
