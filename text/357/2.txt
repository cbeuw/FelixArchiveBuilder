GENERAL COMMENTS
I hadn't attended an NUS conference
before, but at the end of the week it hadn't
really turned out much different f:iom what
I had expected—lots of squabbling between
opposing and semi-opposing political fac-
tions. Left, far left, ultra left and falling off
the edge.
The conference opening was fairly lively—
mainly due to the fact that the introduction
was given by the President of Liverpool
University. "So what?" you might say. Well,
all is revealed when I tell you 'that he was
a Tory (capital t intended).
The majority of the conference was taken
up with a mixture of Executive report and
the main motions (reported on separately
on this page and elsewhere). As ait IC, when
someone stood to make a point of order it
was inevitably used to try and make a speech
for or against the item under discussion.
This inevitably wasted considerable amounts
of time as did the time spent asking the
delegates to be quiet. The impression was
that most delegates were wasting the money
spent by their constituent unions as they
weren't even listening to the debates. In-
stead they preferred (
t
o try and ensure that
no one else could hear.
There were several "in sections" that most
people managed to twist into their speeches
one way or another. The most noticeable
was the FE and small colleges. These are
apparently a section that have got little
attention within the national union in ithe
past but it apepared that they were trying
to make up for at least 1
0 years. Minorities
were also heavily supported.
The Federation of Conservative Students
were also there in force and they came in
for quite a bashing throughout. They also
produced a humph sheet which you either
ignored, laughed at or complained about
depending on your colour, sorry shade
(mainly in varying degrees of redness) of
politics. Their series of seven were, however,
only a drop in what must have been an
enormous drain on the country's paper
stocks. Another interesting point about the
FCS was that they were selling Tribune'
on their Stall in the entrance way outside
the hall. The person who said that student
politics are complicated knew what he was
talking about
Throughout conference there were several
subsidiary meetings for different groups.
Broad left, women, entertainments, student
drama, etc., etc. There were also Compos-
iting Meetings. For those who don't know
a brief explanation may be necessary. Be-
fore conference numerous colleges submit
motions that they would like to see dis-
cussed at conference. These are then circu-
lated and the colleges prioritise several for
discussion at conference (the top five are
normally discussed). At conference, all the
Unions that have submitted motions on a
prioritised topic get together to try and find
points of common understanding between
their own views on the same topic. After a
lot of hard bargaining and !
9
o
m
e give and
take from the people concerned they finally
arrive at one complete motion (normally
fairly large) with several smaller amend-
ments which represent views that are not
held by the majority of those submitting
motions. This motion and amendments is
then debated on the conference floor.
Conference also suffered from 'celebrities'
like one person who always seemed to find
it hard to sit down and was invariably block-
ing up the gangways during both debates
and more especially votes when no one is
supposed to be standing.
I can think of only one redeeming factor
of conference. That is that 'luckily there is
a comedian on the NUS executive (Colin
Burke, Executive member and former presi-
dent O
f Bangor). He is to 'retire' soon but
his replacement is nearly as funny (and
also president of Bangor). Conference was
worth it if only for the closing speech given
jointly by these two.

RACIALISM & OVERSEAS
STUDENTS
This proved to be a major
issue in Conference, provok-
ing a heated debate, and a
(largely unwarranted) storm
of controversy in the Press.
Originally it was not down on
the order paper; however,
following a short procedural
debate, the motions on Rac-
ialism and Overseas Students
were combined, and were
thus discussed in place of the
Housing motion.
Hence. what eventually
came to the floor of Con-
ference, after ithe composit-
ing sessions, which tended to
be a bit hairy, because of the
difficulty of combining two
motions, was a resolution
basically concerned with
racialism and its manifesta-
tions. Four main issues for
a national campaign were
identified:
a. overseas students
b. education
c. discriminatory legislation
d. the growth of fascist or-
ganisations.
It is generally recognised
that overseas students face
discrimination in having to
pay £254 in tuition fees as
against £87 for "home" stu-
dents; in being forced to pay
up to £20 in LEA hostels, as
well as VAT; in terms of a
"quota" system in many col-
leges; and in terms of dis-
crimination by landlords, ac-
commodation bureaux and
employment bureaux.
Conference called for a
campaign against this dis-
crimination and in addition,
rejected the suggestions by
the- Commons Expenditure
Committee that fees for over-
seas postgraduates be raised
to £1,300. This is an issue
particularly pertinent to IC
where some 40-50 per cent of
postgrads are from overseas.
Conference condemned
"the racialism existing in the
education system". This is
reflected in the many books
used by schools ("Little Black
Sambo", "Biggies", etc.), the
high number of non-white
children in schools for the
''educationally sub-normal'',
and the recent "theories" of
inequality between races,
propagated by so-called scien-
tists, eg. Eysenc, Jensen and
Shockley.
Conference called for a re-
futation of these ideas and
for the introduction of black-
studies courses into schools,
eso as I
t
o combat th concept-
ion that 3rd-world people
have no history, culture or
achievements.
Thirdly, Conference reject-
ed the 1971 ImnYigation Act
as racist and discriminatory.
Noting that most of its pro-
visions did not apply to Euro-
peans, delegates rejected the
view that racism stems from
the presence of black people
in Britain.
Complaints against the Pol-
ice and racist activity were
largely ignored by the Gov-
ernment, and the machinery
of Race Relations remains
largely ineffective. Thus
whilst massive publicity is
given to racist speeches, e.g.
Powell's diatribes, the replies
by anti-racist groups go
largely unheard. ,
Finally the bit that you all
heard about. This was an
amendment which fell into
two parts. Thefirstcalled on
Unions not to grant financial
or material assistance to
openly racist or fascist organ-
isations (e.g. National Front
or Monday Club—not the
Conservative Party) and to
deny them a platform.
Many people became steam-
ed up about the right to free
speech. However the profes-
sed raison d'etre of the nam-
ed organisations is to get
rid of people that they dis-
like because of (their colour,
and if this is not immediately
possible, 'to ibrutalise them
in such a way that they will
eventually go away. This in
itself is a fundamental denial
of a man's right to exist.
Hence, it would seem cor-
rect that the apostles of rac-
ial hatred should not be in-
vited onto College premises
because they are preaching a
denial of freedom to the few
by the many, and thus for-
feit their "right" to free
speech.
The argument that it is pos-
sible to debate with fascists
is quite spurious. On the one
hand, it is insufferable arro-
rance to pretend that a stud-
ent might out-argue Enoch
Powell, no matter how clear
the rights and wrongs before-
hand. On the other hand, we
have the experience of Jews
in Nazi-occupied territories
as a precedent of "reasoned
debate" with fascists.
Hence the essential issue is
whether to invite racists to
Colleges or hot. I do not see
the issue as being in grave
doubt; I believe that students
particularly the overseas Stu-
ents, will reject the concept
of having fascists on campus.
In this case, the issue of
what to do if these people
do get on to campuses is
of very little importance.
Besides, the idea of basing
a campaign on us waiting
for fascists to hold a meet-
ing so that we can disrupt it
anyway is quite ludicrous.
Finally the point is that,
particularly, in terms of the
campaign on overseas tlud-
ents, we now have a national
initiative to go ahead with.
I expect to see some action
on this front very shortly;
support the campaign.

EXECUTIVE REPORT
NUS executive prepare and take a report
showing exactly what use the resources of
NUS have been put to since the last report.
They must show, especially, what they have
done on specific mandates from Conference.
As the Executive is composed mainly of
non-sabbatical officers, who are not able to
do all that conference expects of them, there
are, usually,fireworksas a particular mem-
ber's incompetence in one section (often due
to spending too much time on something
else) is ruthlessly exposed on the confer-
ence floor. Written questions to the report
are tabled in advance of conference and
an answer is supplied at conference. If this
answer is not satisfactory a verbal supple-
mentary question can be asked by the con-
stituent organisation during the time that
section of the report is before conference.
If the reply is still unsatisfactory the con-
stituent organisation can move any of the
following procedural motions:
1. Reference Back of the report.
2. Rejection of an executive opinion.
3. Instruction to do what they were man-
dated to do.
4. Continuation as not enough has been
done yet.
5. Censure on a member of the executive.
6. Removal of a specfic responsibility from
a member.
The report was split into sections of
Meetings, Adult Education, Assessment,
Careers advice and counselling, Casework,
Ents, Gay Rights, Grants, Health Students,
Housing, Lecturer Training Part Time and
Industrial Students, Postgraduates, Repre-
sentation, Specialist Groups, Sport, Student
Health, White Paper, Women, Art 'Colleges,
College of Education, Technical Colleges
and Polytechnics, Universities in the Educa-
tion and Welfare section, Legal Advice and
Aid, Regions and Areas, Disputes, Student
Community Action, International and Miscel-
laneous, Overseas Students, Race Relations/
Racism, NUSS, Conservation and Trade
Unions.
Of special interest to I.C. students might
be:
Ents: NUS's clown Burke still thinks
brokerage is feasible someday (5-10 years
in answer to a supplementary question).
Gay Rights: Al Stewart has responsibility
still.
Postgraduates: dominated by NUS/ASTMS
clash over negotiating rights.
White Paper: Like I.C., NUS has done
very little. NUS had a mandate to run a
campaign on a similar (Standing to Grants.
Exec blatantly ignored this. Stuart Paul wa3
censured and the report referred back.
Women: A very militant lot. You dont
argue with Judy Cotter!! Best (in fact only)
thing they could do is to try to organise
trouble at the anti-abortion rally in London,
on 28th April. A rather sterile lot.
Essex was presented at conference at the
start of the revolution. Great glee wheal
Stuart Paul (Broad Left candidate for Presf*
dent) was quoted as saying that it was all
just an IMG stunt. Conference generally to
sympathy.
Sunday Times National Student Drama
Festival: Exec was against having anything
to do with this. A strong drama lobby re*
ferred back the report with a great deal of
help from Al Stewart who had been landedk
with a bad policy from his predecessor^
A one-day conference on drama is to be
organised and this will resolve the matter.
Soviet Dissidents: This is rapidly becoming
silly. Both at Margate and Liverpool, Exec
have tried a Whitewash. This time John
Cushnlhan—I will defend Russia as the best
state—presented a report. This was really a
treatise on newspaper subjectivity. I.C. cult
through the waffle with its only question:
"Does Exec deny that the weight of evi-
dence is that there are massive numbers
of genuine dissidents in the Soviet Union "a
John Cushnihan replied that he did not
deny that there were substantial numbers
and he had no doubt about this.
The report was so bad it was referred
back.
All the degelates should have copies of
the report and you 'should be able to see
one if you come into I.C. Union office and
grab one of the I.C. Exec. I shall be available
to give further details when we report to
Council.
D. SINCLAffi
Deputy President,
ELECTIONS
As far as I am sure many of you are
concerned, the only important and doubtful
result was in the election of President.
There were five challengers:
Beeson—Young Socialist (I don't know
what to do now the Tories have resigned").
Hill—International Socialist (Wears dark
glasses to shield himself from the realities
of ithe world).
McGowan—International Marxist group
(very difficult to understand, but his ideas
tvere similar to those of the ultra-left).
Paul—Broad left (Scottish, beer gut, this
year's D.P. quoted to be the "Executive
doll of the Broad Left movement").
Randall—This year's president (No par-
ticular political affiliation other than Left—
most frequently used adjective, verb, pro-
noun . . . is F.E's. (Further Education col-
leges) due I
t
o the great deal of support he
has gained from this sector over the past
1
2 months).
The only real contenders for the post
were Paul and Randall, who have been bitch-
ing at each other since last November when
Mr. Paul and his Broad Left friends decided
that Mr. Randall's lead in the Grants cam-
paign was lacking in incentive and new
ideas, or rather, his support for what was
happening was non-existent.
Unfortunately, Mr. Paul did not realise
that whilst he was spending so much time
criticising Mr. Randall, he was not in fact
carrying out a mandate laid on him by Mar-
gate conference, i.e. to develop a campaign
around the White Paper on the content of
higher education, which was supposed to
be given equal priority to the Grants cam-
paign'! This bitching had gone on for some
time, and had lost support for both candi-
dates, consequently, when the votes were
counted it was very close, there only being
21 votes between these two candidates in
the final analysis:

McGowan 25 28
Paul 281 285 287
Randall 263 265 266
The motion on postgraduates prioritised at the Universities Specialist Conference
formed the main part of the substantive motion. Sections on overseas postgraduates
and the expenditure committee's report were also included. The only contentious issue
was whether or not the NiUS should have sole negotiating rights as far as tutoring and
demonstrating rates are concerned. There were two amendments on this—one stating
that (Postgraduates should join (the relevant trade union. Which would then negotiate
on their behaK and the other giving sole negotiating rights to the NUS. Both were de-
feated. A fuller report on the postgraduate debate appears on page 4.

My only comment is that I saw Randall
out walking with his wife and young child
shortly afterwards, and he looked like a
man who realised that a majority of 21 out
of 649 votes was not what could be called
a clear indication that the NUS conference
wanted him to be their President.
There is however one consolation, he can-
not make a worse job of it next year than
he has this year.
The second election was a clear cut affair,
and the obvious candidate deserved to get!
elected, this was Al Stewart. He has had
responsibility for the Gay movement in
NUS this year, and as such has done an
excellent job. The other candidates were
Waller (Far Left idiot), Robinson (inexpert*
enced member of ConSoc), Martin (obsessed
with occupations and militancy).
The voting was as follows:
Waller 1
4
8
Stewart 430
Robinson 1
0
7
Martin ill
The third election was for a National
Secretary. Starring in this episode was the
famous Steve (Basher) Parry, this year's
National Secretary, who has been accused
of everything from bringing children into
the world, to removing them from it. lit
was obvious from the start of the hustings
the other candidates had merely been put
up to get at Parry, but my impression wa»
that he was the obvious candidate. The
voting was as follows:
1st 1st 2nd 3r*
count reallocation
Burke 206 208 219 300
Fitzpatrick 9
Lukes 36 38
Parry 326 329 330 352
Pov;y 1
0
5 106 130
The fourth sabbatical election was for
National Treasurer. The only real candidate
for this was Charles Clarke. The voting was
as follows:
Clarke 362
Fitzpatrick 173
Robinson 9
4
Willshire 8
The remainder of the elections on to
the NUS executive were not quite so heated,
and a list of successful candidates follows:
Vicej
Presidents—Services, Robertson; Eduj
cation, Slipman; Regions, Bailey; without
Portfolio, Carr.
Executive Officers—Gates, De Graaf, Web-
ster.
Executive Committee Officers—Elliot,
Male, Povey.
Next year's executive is mainly allied t
X
>
the Broad Left political faction, which can
probably be classed as the least extreme,
most sensible grouping which there is at
present. Those few members of the executive
not in this group should in general remain
unobtrusive with (hopefully) the one ex-
ception of John Randall. Bt will ibe interest
ing to see over the next 1
2 months if Wie
executive achieves as much as it is capable
of doing.
