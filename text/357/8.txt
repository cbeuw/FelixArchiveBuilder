HOCKEY
After reaching the diz-
zy heights of a tour to
Holland last Easter, this
year saw ICHC visiting
that Mecca of the East
Coast—Lowestoft.
A squad of ten depar-
ted from Southsidc on
the Thursday afternoon
(the prominent absences
of Messrs. Heffer & Bate-
man were noted and suit-
ably commented upon).,
On arrival at our Guest
House the intriguing pa-
radox arose of how to fit
ten (male) bodies into
eight beds. The subse-
quent events in room 7
will never be known, but
the respective latecomers
to the breakfast table
would suggest the ar-
rangement was not too
incompatible. (What
about room 9, Ian?).
On Good Friday we
played our first match
against the Galleymack-
ers (from Ashby-de-la
Zouch). The "All Star X "
plus an obliging goalkeep-
er from Bath University,
put up an amazing dis-
play of hockey skills, but
went down 3-2.
The same afternoon we
played Leahoe. The game
opened in grand style
with a scintillating first
half performance by IC.
Having opened a two goal
lead, we decided to give
Leahoe a chance, which
they promptly took and
equallised. Unfortunately
a bit of needle crept into
the match, with one pile
up, in particular, of
which the 1st X V pack
would have been proud.
In this game, Richard
Cameron was forced to
retire with a fractured
appendage. Whilst this re-
duced our squad to nine,
we were grateful to have
an efficient umpire for the
rest of our matches.
Saturday morning's op-
ponents, Lowestoft Rail-
way, proved easy meat.
Mick Downs slammed a
"four-trick" (even with-
out his gloves) and con-
sequently bought a
round at lunchtime. Ni-
gel Woodhouse also scor-
ed to give final tally of
5-0.
The afternoon's match
against Haverhill was
played in utter confusion
with both teams playing
in blue and white. How-
ever, IC overcame the
problem better than our
opponents and triumphed
2-0.
We were al! glad to
have a day off on Sunday
to nurse our wounds.
Tim Hanson made better
use of his time than most
by picking up a fiver (his
second within a month.
Club treasurer would you
believe!) Most evenings
were spent patronizing
the 'Spread Eagle' (it ap-
pears that we left that
pub branded as a gang
of lunatics!) Our revered
captain MDD claims that
he won the 'Fizz-Buzz'
c h a m p i o n s h i p but
in reality he was too
pissed to remember exact-
ly what happened. The
evenings ended with the
inevitable room 9 Card
School (How much were
you down Tim?).
On Monday we were
back in action against
the Tightons X I (from
Bristol). This was a me-
morable game for Bob
(Hopalong) Evans. Not
only did he snap up two
goals, but he was also
struck in the face with a
full-blooded shot from
Dave Harrison. Dave was
immediately congratula-
ted by the rest of the po-
ker crew (Bob had a
lucky run the previous
night). Two more goals
gave us a comfortable 4-1
victory. This game was
played with the hysterical
support of two fourteen
year old girls who, rumour
has is, had been suitably
seduced by a certain mem-
ber of the team who shall
remain nameless. I be-
lieve they came from
Leeds. (Isn't that right
Tim?)
Everyone appeared to
enjoy themselves and the
results show that the tour
was also a success from
the hockey viewpoint.

RUGBY
RUGBY CLUB TOUR
The tour party arrived
at Victoria very promptly
with two minutes to
spare, as recommended
by British Rail. A quiet
rail trip to Dover was fol-
lowed by an even quieter
boat trip — after the first
hour that is. After this
time everyone was too
pissed to speak and the
duty free shop was sold
out of all spirits. Rob
Jones had the first puke
of the tour.
When we had arrived
at Ostend enough of us
had sobered up to carry
the rest off the boat. Here,
Tim Thomas signed a six
month contract to film as
the naked partner of
Brussels most famous
manikin and was assured
a bed for this time with
the raving poofter in the
fur coat. Customs officials
were seen to shake their
heads in disgust as they
saw their beautiful coun-
try invaded by this appar-
ently uncivilised mob.
The train journey to
Brussels was a continua-
tion of the binge on the
boat, pass the bottle being
the most popular game.
The scenes at the hotel
were chaotic. A dozen
pissed students milling
about the reception was
not the way to gain entry
to the hotel and Tour
Manager was told to take
the party away to sober
up. The rest of the party
lay prostrate on the pave-
ment outside the hotel in
a state of absolute bliss.
The rest of the even-
ing passed quietly in the
Cafe Royale where our
hosts of the following day
entertained us. Entry to
the hotel was secured
after our passports had
been confiscated and
Tour Manager had given
a promise of good behav-
iour (Raucous laughter).
The night in the hotel will
not be described as we do
not want any evidence in
writing.
An early start was
made to the next day
with a meeting at the
Royale at 1.15 p.m. From
there we were ferried to
the Brussels' British
ground. An entertaining
and very enjoyable game
was played. We scored
first after about 5 min-
utes through Martin Cot-
ter but were pinned back
for a long period during
which time Ithe Brussels
British equalised With a
good try. However, the
class was beginning to tell
and tries were scored by
Cotter (3), Hughes (2),
Spanker (1) with a pen-
alty in reply. IC ran out
winners by 31—9.
We were entertained
cordially by the opposi-
tion and were given the
Brussels rendering of
Eskimo Nell, after the
match. In between tapp-
ing Roger the Dodger for
a job a lot of ale was
drunk—at the Dodgers
expense of course.
A thoroughly enjoyable
time was had for the rest
of the time uninterrupted
by any more matches as
the services team we had
arranged to play were all
posted abroad the pre-
vious week (subtle).
We were invited to re-
turn annually but a bi-
ennial fixture was provi-
sionally accepted. We
would like to thank ACC
for their generous grant
especially Big Max. His
silver hammer has been
confiscated to pay for the
various damages that oc-
curred on the tour.

LAST SEPTEMBER, the demo-
cratically elected Attend© gov-
ernment was overthrown in
Chile by the local ruling class.
Since then, the military junta
there has banned all trade unions
and political parties, gagged the
press and denied the people
freedom of speech. In order to
stay in power, The Chilean mili-
tary have so far murdered over
30,000 people and put an equal
number in prison.
The coup was encouraged and
supported by international com-
panies such as ITT, who feared
that their ability to plunder the
wealth of Chile would be lost to
them forever. Many of the com-
panies who worked actively to
bring down Allende have large
investments in Britain. If the
Chilean people are to be aided
in their fight against dictatorship,
the big monopolies, and the gov-
ernments representing their in-
terests, must be denied the right
to continue with their support
for the military butchers.
Before the last election, many
Labour leaders publicly pledged
that a future Labour government
would break all links with the
junta1
. But once in office, the
Labour Party have failed to
carry out their former promises.
Mr. Callaghan, the Foreign Sec-
retary, has told parliament that
he intends to allow £65 million
worth of arms to be sent to this
repressive regime.
Eric Heffer has been the only
member of the government to
date with courage enough to con-
demn this decision. We support
Mr. Heffer'is statement, but re-
cognise that words alone will not
alter the government's attitude.
As many people as possible must
demonstrate on May 5th against
present government policy, which
represents a betrayal of both
the Chilean and British working
class.
However, this isn't the sole aim
of the demonstration1
. The gov-
ernment's record has shown that
we cannot leave it to them to
ensure that the junta is denied
all trade with Britain. If the gov-
ernment fails to change its pol-
icy on Chile, trade unionists have
to make certain that the warships
ordered by the junta are not fin-
ished or launched from British
shipyards. This action must be
combined with a general blacking
of goods going to or coming from
Chile.
The Labour government must
also be made to change its atti-
tude toward political refugees.
On this issue, Mr. Wilson's Social
Democratic counterparts in Swe-
den have a better record than
his own administration. They
have provided grants to employ
lecturers, students and artists
deprived of their jobs and homes
in Chile because of their com-
mitment Ito the Chilean working
class. The Labour Government
has to exceed this example and
open the doors to all those who
have managed to escape from
the repression raging in Chile.
DEMAND THAT THE LABOUR GOVERNMENT
WITHDRAWS RECOGNITION NOW!
