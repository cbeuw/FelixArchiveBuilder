POSTGRADUATE GROUP A.G.M. FRIDAY, 3rd MAY • 1 p.m. ELEC ENG 408
EDITORIAL
This is the tenth issue of P G News and the second
in this format, but there are still plenty of postgradu-
ates who have never seen one. All over this page there
are little reminders about the A G M of the Post-
graduate Group being held on Friday 3rd May at 1
o'clock in Elec Eng 408. So ffon't just mark a date in
your diary to remind yourself to come, but mark the
date in all your mates diaries too. Think of it as
you would giving a friend a years subscription to the
Readers Digest—well on second thoughts
What happens at an A G M ? Well, several boring
things: the election of a committee, ratification of a
constitution, very short reports, etc. But also there
will be a few motions. Why are these important? Well
they will give the committee a mandate with
which to negotiate with the relevant authorities. So
come along, it shouldn't last more than an hour.
The present "Postgraduate Plight" has warranted
leading articles in Nature and New Scientist, a two
week report in THES, letters i n the Times and the
Guardian, and questions in the House of Lords. The
grant for the next three years will be announced
soon. So, will our plight be over, or just entering a
new phase? Just in case of the latter, we must be pre-
pared.
The postgraduate group has been active in this col-
lege for just over a year now. It has achieved a lot.
Let's keep it active, there's plenty more to achieve
yet.

OVER
REPORT
The Exploratory Com-
mittee is a College com-
mittee with two student
representatives w h i c h
meets occasionally to dis-
cuss things that it is man-
dated to discuss. Recently
a Board of Studies Meet-
ing referred to it the
House of Commons E x -
penditure Committee's
report on Postgraduate
Education. So it (the
Exploratory Committee)
set about making a report
on the report. It met With-
out the two student mem-
bers, mainly because of a
lack of communications
at the Union's end, and
produced a report. This
report was totally un-
acceptable to the post-
graduate group, and in-
deed most students who
have seen it, so we wrote
another report i.e. a re-
port of a report of a re-
port if you follow.
What are these reports?
Well the government re-
port recommends-loans to
supplement grants and
higher fees for overseas
students. The College
committee's report says
that it does not oppose
loans in principle as long
as the grant element is
adequate, and addition-
ally it does not oppose
higher fees for overseas
students in principle but
it depended on whether
average or .marginal costs
were charged. Our report
is much simpler.
We oppose loans and
oppose higher fees for
overseas students in prin-
ciple.

NUS DISCOVERS PG's
The NUS has at last
decided that postgradu-
ates are students and now
has policy covering nearly
all aspects of postgradu-
ate education. The main
substantive motion was
concocted by U C L , Im-
perial and others, and
this was passed by an
overwhelming majority.
The many aspects dealt
with in the substantive
motion include research,
government policy on P G
education, overseas post-
graduates, demonstrating
and tutoring rates, rela-
tions with industry, co-
operation with t r a d e
unions, working condi-
tions, relations Vis a vis
the 'supervisor' and fin-
ally the need ito organise
active postgraduate asso-
ciations.
On research the confer-
ence declared that 'The
function of research is to
provide information and
further the understanding
of the environment of
man, so that he might
best gain advantage from
the resources available to
him, in all fields of human
endeavour' (Wot's that
Brian). Conference also
stated that postgraduates
carry out much of the re-
search in many depart-
ments and as such are an
indispensable (but of
course) part of the uni-
versities.
As far as government
policy on P G education
was concerned, confer-
ence took note of the
third report from the Ex-
ecutive Committee (Edu-
cation and Arts sub-com-
mittee) and the fact that
the N U S executive has
publically condemned it.
Most of the proposals
embodied in this report,
such as loan subsidies for
British Students and in-
creases in overseas' stu-
dents fees were totally
unacceptable.
The fact that overseas
postgraduates (where are
you?) have special prob-
lems has been accepted by
ACCOMMODATION
Commencing 1974/75,
there is a new rule that
all postgraduates may be
resident for 2 years re-
gardless of previous years
in residence as an under-
graduate; any years in re-
sidence as an undergrad-
uate are discounted.
There may be some
students who did not
know about his ruling,
and assumed they were in-
eligible to apply because
either
(a) they had been in resi-
dence for one year as an
undergraduate and one
year as a postgraduate, pr
(b) they had been in resi-
dence for 2 years as an
undergraduate.

(a) The closing date for
postgraduates who have
had one year in residence
as a postgraduate is 12.00

NUS. Among these are
their weak financial posi-
tion the churlish behavi-
our of the British govern-
ment in preventing them
from taking part time
jobs and the threat of visa
removal (i.e. deportation)
if they join trade unions.
Finally conference ob-
jected to the fact that
overseas students have to
pay excessive tuition
(what tuition?) fees.
On demonstrating and
tutoring rates conference
expressed their disgust at
the use of postgraduates
as cheap labour, and de-
clared t h a t payment
should be tied to the
basic rate of the Univers-
ity lecturer's pay scale.
While conference had
no objections to industry
sponsoring postgraduate
students, the style and
nature of Ithe research
should not be rigidly dic-
tated. Conference de-
clared its distaste for mili-
tary research and any
other type not beneficial
to mankind. On trade
unions, conference was in
favour of complete co-
operation.
Working conditions
should be conducive to
the type of research being
done. Ready and frequent
discussions with the sup-
ervisor are essential, and
he should be available for
at least nine months of
the year. Under their sec-
tion conference also de-
clared that all fees and
costs incurred by the stu-
dent in the preparation of
the thesis should be paid
by the grant awarding
body.
This is but a brief sum-
mary document. If any

SAVE AS
YOU LEARN
\-----------------------
In these days of rising
prices and inflation it is
refreshing to be able to
bring to the attention of
students and graduates a
way of saving money. I
am referring to the range
of policies offered by
Endsleigh Insurances, the
wholly owned brokerage
of the NUS.
Those of you who have
had occasion to need in-
surance for your car,
property or overseas
travel have almost cer-
tainly encountered the
traditional attitude to-
wards students requiring
insurance. Students are a
bad risk, extra premiums
must be imposed is the
general consensus of opin-
ion. E N D S L E I G H DIS-
A G R E E .
Endsleigh were set up
by the N U S to provide a
full Insurance Broking
Service to students and
graduates in 1965. From
the starting point of a
single room we have ex-
panded to a network of
37 N U S Insurance Cen-
tres throughout the U . K .
This remarkable growth
has been achieved by
offering policies in all
classes of insurance, at a
discount. A t the same
time the quality of the in-
surance cover is guaran-
teed by Endsleigh only
dealing with leading in-
surance groups. Ends-
leigh's strength lies in the
600,000 membership of
the N U S and the even
greater number of gradu-
ates.
The Conventional and
the Unconventional
The insurance require-
ments of students and
graduates often mean that
conventional insurance
policies do not provide
adequate protection alt a
reasonable coSt. Ends-
leigh have therefore
developed a range of poli-
cies which are exclusive
to students and graduates.
In addition Endsleigh are
able to provide cover for
some of the more unusual
risks: Last year for in-
stance elephants joined
the Stampede for Ends-
leigh policies. A Students
Union required cover dur-
ing rag week and it was
provided, elephants and
all!
Cover for Top Climbers
Insurance of the British
Torre Egger expedition
represented the greatest
coup yet for the special
mountaineering policy
announced last year as an
addition to Endsleigh's
ISIS range of policies. A l -
though this is not Ithe first
large expedition to use
ISlS-4he 1973 Joten-
heim expedition was in-
sured by Endsleigh—it is
the first world-class one.
The ISIS Travel Insur-
ance schemes operated by
Endsleigh have always
enjoyed considerable suc-
cess for two particular
reasons. Firstly, the rates
are competitive and the
policies offer wide ranging
cover. They are uncom-
plicated and easy to un-
derstand.
Property Insurance
The Endsleigh technical
department has now suc-
cessfully incorporated the
virtues of the ISIS system
into a range of property
insurances. A s the needs
and circumstances of
graduates differ from
those of students, it was
decided to diversify into
separate contracts for
each, as has been done in
Motor Insurance. Each
package deals especially
with the type of accom-
modation in which the
insured is most likely to
be living; the student plan
policy is specifically for
halls of residence, shared
flats, lodgings and bed-
sitters, but whilst the
Gradplan property insur-
ance policy includes cover
for non self-contained and
shared accommodation, it
is primarily for the grad-
uate living alone with his
family in completely self-
contained premises. Both
policies are primarily
contents insurances, that
is Ithey are designed to
cover household goods
and personal effects
against a variety of risks,
whilst in the home of the
insured person.
Motor Insurance
The only compulsory
insurance in the U . K .
(apart from National In-
surances) is motor insur-
ance. By law you must
effect insurance to pro-
tect third parties, which
includes • passengers,
against loss or injury. It is
therefore not surprising
that Endsleigh provide
special policies for stud-
ents (Student Plan) and
graduates (Gradplan).
Luckily at Endsleigh we
are able to give you value
for money. Y o u will be
pleasantly surprised to
read that Endsleigh can
actually cut the cost of
your motoring. Ask for a
quotation, you will not be
disappointed.
LIFE ASSURANCE—
FOR NOW AND LATER
It is not always appre-
ciated that Life Assur-
ance is not just a means
of providing financial
security for dependants;
it is also a very valuable
means of building up
capital for future needs.
The earlier you start, the
better the terms available.
Indeed almost everyone
taking out Life Assurance
for the first time wishes
he had done so earlier.
There are many different
types of policy and the
Endsleigh approach is to
discuss your own particu-
lar needs before making a
recommendation. Ends-
leigh offer a full range of
Life Assurance and Sav-
ings schemes available at
a discount for NUS mem-
