MIND YOUR VAT
Towards the e n d of last term Basics,
the Southside pizza place started to
c h a r g e VAT to students purchasing
f o o d f r o m there. Basics staff were
instructed by their m a n a g e r s not t o
p r o m p t students f o r proof of stu-
dent identity, a n d to c h a r g e VAT if
ID w a s n o t volunteered. Basics
staff reported to Kevin that this
c h a n g e in p r o c e d u r e resulted in
m a n y students paying too m u c h for
their Pizza. Kevin warns students
that they will be o v e r c h a r g e d in this
way by m a n y outlets run by both the
U n i o n a n d C o l l e g e unless they
actively wave their U n i o n card at
the person serving them.
NOVELTY GREEN-
HOUSE
Sir N o r m a n Foster, architect of the
B M S building h a d s o m e problems
with another of his projects, the
G e r m a n g o v e r n m e n t building the
Reichstag, c o m p l e t e d shortly after
o u r o w n g r e e n h o u s e . G o v e r n m e n t
officials w e r e a s t o n i s h e d w h e n
shortly after m o v i n g in they noticed
that the roof w a s leaking. A
s p o k e s m e n for Foster r e s p o n d e d to
the c o m p l a i n t with the statement:
"It was always the intention to allow
water in". This leaves Kevin w o n -
dering what architectural novelties
may have been d e s i g n e d into the
South Kensington building.
VIDEOCONFERENCE
MADNESS
The G r e a t Hall is to be used for the
R C S freshers' w e l c o m e , with the
' s h o w ' relayed to those w h o c a n
Mish
Mash
A Mostly Harmless Column by
Kevin, a random entity who
knows nothing about nothing
not fit in by v i d e o c o n f e r e n c i n g
technology to the Pippard lecture
theatre in Sherfield. C a n s o m e o n e
find the prat w h o is obsessed with
all this v i d e o c o n f e r i n g a n d
videoteaching, a n d remote learn-
ing nonsense so we c a n shoot h i m .
The Royal G e o g r a p h i c a l Society,
which was used last year is a m u c h
m o r e impressive v e n u e , m o r e
importantly it also has the capacity
to hold all the students.
NEW SABBATICALS...
Kevin judges any U n i o n O f f i c e r by
their behaviour, a n d suspects he
will n o t b e the only o n e u n i m -
p r e s s e d at s a b b a t i c a l s a b u s i n g
their new-found p o w e r to let their
cronies into sold-out events f o r
free. It is likely that the first time
m a n y i m p r e s s i o n a b l e first years see
their sabbaticals will b e when they
are ushering their mates past them
into p a c k e d fresher's week c a r n i -
vals o r c o m e d y nights.
In Kevin's o p i n i o n Miss N e w t o n
is confident that s h e is suitably
trendy, yet student-y e n o u g h to lead
a Student's U n i o n . Kevin expects
her to b e u n c o n c e r n e d with her
i m a g e , believing that she has g o t
the w h o l e student thing sorted.
M o s t of her time will b e spent c o n -
centrating o n the efficient running
of h e r o r g a n i s a t i o n . If she suc-
ceeds in proving herself c a p a b l e of
d o i n g this, it will b e useful to her
later in life a s today's medics a r e
expected to b e excellent m a n a g e r s
as well as doctors.
The PopTarts are in the toaster,
