Deputy President (Finance & Services) - Ian Clifford
You may ask why you should vote for Ian Clifford.
[translation] You've never heard o f m e a n d /
have no real policies...
Firstly, I have experience of the U n i o n finance
system. A s treasurer of the City & G u i l d s C o l l e g e
U n i o n I work with clubs & societies, assisting them
with budgets, claims a n d unravelling red tape. I
have faced the d r e a d e d U n i o n budgeting rounds
a n d w o n .
[translation] The crowning glory of my two
terms as C&G treasurer was the successful pur-
chase of silly hats for our bar nights.
I have prepared the finances of the C & G U a s
a whole. I know how the U n i o n runs from a club
finance side as well as the services side.
[translation] The job title's got the word servic-
es in, so I'd better mention them somewhere.
Secondly, I have been a student at Imperial for
five years and a m e m b e r of several clubs including
the Mountaineering C l u b , Pimlico C o n n e c t i o n a n d
the C a t h o l i c Society
[translation] If you have any spare ropes, text
books or crucifixes, please donate them to Ian Clif-
ford c/o the Union Office. W e have no money after
buying the hats and purchasing sabbatical T-shirts.
I work in the U n i o n Resource Centre, helping
both students a n d union staff - I will be as
a p p r o a c h a b l e as a sabbatical like I a m as a m e m -
ber of staff. Personal contact a n d interest is impor-
tant in establishing a g o o d working relationship.
Deputy President (Education & Welfare) - Kevin Butcher
Finally I C U has created a s a b b a t i c a l responsible
for e d u c a t i o n a n d welfare. I feel confident in tak-
ing o n a n undefined role a n d creating a j o b
description - e n c o m p a s s i n g a l l aspects of e d u -
cation a n d welfare.
[translation] It was very kind of the Union to
provide me with a "job description" and then for
the president to take it away...
Since c o m i n g to Imperial a s a p o s t g r a d u a t e
student I've b e e n involved in the u n i o n : c h a i r o f
Imperial Q u e e r s a n d S C C treasurer this year.
Before Imperial I w a s involved with clubs o f
O x f o r d a n d Aberystwyth a n d was a volunteer for
O x f o r d Nightline. This experience has given m e
the necessary m o t i v a t i o n , listening skills, p e o p l e
skills, a p p r o a c h a b i l i t y a n d fair j u d g e m e n t
required for D P (E&W).
[translation] Trust me, I'm fluffy enough for
this job.
I have three m a i n a i m s . Firstly ! intend to
work o n the welfare c o m m i t t e e ' s job d e s c r i p t i o n .
This will b e in consultation with a l l the relevant
U n i o n a n d C o l l e g e committees ( A c c o m m o d a -
tion, welfare, A c a d e m i c Affairs, Student Devel-
o p m e n t etc.) the current sabbs a n d various c o l -
lege officers (including the Pro-Rector for E d u c a -
tional Quality).
[translation] Come on, you have to vote for
me - I know the n a m e s o f all the College staff
and everything.
S e c o n d l y I intend to ask a s m a n y of the E & W
sabbs across the country a b o u t their role, their
c o n c e r n s a n d h o p e s . T h e first t w o w o u l d b e
c o m p l e t e d before the new a c a d e m i c year.
[translation] I'll go on lots of expenses p a d
"fact finding" missions.
Thirdly, starting the new term with this base,
I will consult as many students as possible. D P
(E&W) will work best if as m a n y p e o p l e as possi-
ble a r e m a d e a w a r e of the e d u c a t i o n a n d wel-
fare brief a n d it the job is tailored to the needs of
the students. I w o u l d undertake a regular section
[translation] And we all know how friendly the
Union staff are
Next year I aim to:
• Increase c o m m u n i c a t i o n s & training with
treasurers
[translation] You might be able to read the
finance manual without falling asleep.
• O p e n up the union to more students
[translation] Don't know where we're going to
put them though - we can't afford any more space.
• Reform funding, payments a n d standardise
subsidies
[translation] Coincidently giving more money
to C&G, Mountaineering, Pimlico Connection,
Catholic Society...
in Felix a n d the C C U papers.
[translation] I am the only sabbatical actual-
ly intending to get something done this year...
A w a r e n e s s events (about two per term) will
c o i n c i d e with students experiences (eg a c c o m -
m o d a t i o n week w h e n students a r e thinking
a b o u t h o u s i n g , a sexual health week to c o i n c i d e
with W o r l d AIDS Day, a stress buster to c o i n c i d e
(as close as possible) with e x a m s a n d a mental
health week. I h o p e to c o n v i n c e C C U officers
a n d the d e p reps to ensure that student repre-
sentation is fair a n d a d e q u a t e across all d e p a r t -
ments.
ftrans/afion] Hopefully the CCU officers and
dep reps won't be quite as useless as u s u a l . . .
Felix Editor - Dave Roberts
Felix is t h e p r i m a r y s o u r c e o f i n f o r m a t i o n f o r
students at Imperial , s o it's vital that it presents
e n o u g h m a t e r i a l for students to r e a c h their o w n
o p i n i o n s o n key issues - whilst the reporting
itself r e m a i n s u n b i a s e d .
[translation] Felix is the primary source of
scandal and manipulative articles at Imperial
College. I will use subliminal messaging to get
my views a c r o s s . Your opinion means nothing.
To this e n d , I'll i n t r o d u c e r e g u l a r in-depth
features o n the m a j o r student issues - like U L U ,
fees a n d C o l l e g e e x p a n s i o n - s o that e v e r y o n e
has a c h a n c e t o u n d e r s t a n d what's really g o i n g
o n . P r o p e r d i s s e m i n a t i o n o f i n f o r m a t i o n a l s o
m e a n s p r o p e r distribution, s o I'll ensure that
Felix hits every c a m p u s o n t h e s a m e day, a n d
a p p e a r s o n the w e b every week.
[translation] Because at Imperial we really
care about ULU, fees, and College expansion.
Bollocks more like.

tunity t o tell everyone w h a t they d o . C o n s e -

[translation] ICU and C C U ' s justifying them-
selves? I'll eat my copy first. Please, keep your
bullshit down to a minimum of 100 words.
Felix is a c l u b , a n d like any other at Imper-
ial it must b e o p e n t o a l l . A s well a s i n c r e a s e d
