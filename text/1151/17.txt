Y
ou don't know it yet but you've been wait-
ing for this a l b u m . You've sampled the
cheeky absurdity of Pumping On Your
Stereo a n d experienced the shotgun chorus of
M o v i n g . A n d although this should have been a
warning shot that something fairly special was to
follow, there were other things g o i n g o n that
diverted your attention. W e l l it's time y o u g o t
back in the swing of things, so sit up, sharpen
your pencil a n d start taking s o m e notes. Point 1:
Supergrass have released their third a l b u m . Point
2: It's the best a l b u m this year so far.
If In It For The Money saw s o m e sort of tran-
sition from bum-fluff p o p artists t o serious musi-
cians, then Supergrass reinforces double-fold the
fact that this transition is well a n d truly complete.
This is the sound of a b a n d hitting its peak.
The singles have been fantastic. What Went
Wrong (In Your Head) will probably join them, as
the initial singing of the title line is the o n e of the
most m e m o r a b l e moments of the a l b u m . Varied
a n d p r o u d , contemplative ( M a m a <
& Papa) a n d
sometimes sloganeering-ly silly (Jesus C a m e From
Outta Space), Supergrass have created a piece of
work that holds itself up with i m p e c c a b l e balance.
The kids aren't just alright; they're outstanding!
