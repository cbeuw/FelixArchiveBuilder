Tasting Notes
Week O n e : The Basics
W
elcome to the first in a new
series of Felix c o o k i n g
c o l u m n s . I'm g o i n g to
attempt the impossible - to provide
something f o r everyone. C o o k i n g
really is easy. To prove the point, this
c o l u m n will build up slowly, reaching
a full roast before Christmas.
For most c o o k i n g , y o u only
need a few simple rules. In the Basic
Skill section I intend to cover a small
step along the way each week. The
M e a l Suggestion will then give
instructions f o r making a whole
m e a l , without using anything
beyond the skills covered so far. F o r
the more adventurous, there will
also be a n A d v a n c e d Tip containing
an interesting idea or technique.
The Basic Skill
Boiling Water
To start off, this is a really basic but
very important skill. First, a few
words about pans. Obviously, the
main distinction is between non-stick
and ordinary. For the novice, n o n -
stick is probably the best choice,
although there a r e s o m e things
which are difficult to d o with a n o n -
stick pan (eg achieving a g o o d g o l d -
en brown finish). The other impor-
tant characteristic is the thickness of
the base - in general, pans should
have a moderately thick base.
C o n t r o l l i n g the temperature
under a p a n is o n e of the most
important skills to learn. If the heat is
too great, food will burn, o r c o o k
unevenly. If the heat is t o o low, you
may not get the food hot enough for
the desired effect. The key to most
tasks is to vary the temperature.
W h e n boiling a p a n of water,
start by turning the heat up as far as
possible. Loads of heat is required at
first to raise the temperature of the
water. As a general rule, you should
never turn the heat so high that gas
flames o r an electric glow are visible
round the edge of the p a n . W h e n
the water is boiling, a d d the food
you want to boil. You will still need to
heat the p a n fairly hard, because
now the food needs to b e raised in
temperature. At the point where the
water is boiling, with the food in the
pan, you will need to lower the t e m -
perature, s o that amount of heat
applied matches the heat which is
being lost. In this way the p a n will
boil gently, without so much e v a p o -
ration that the p a n m a y boil dry.
Meal Suggestion
Pasta with Pesto
Pasta is great. It is easy to cook, full
of energy, a n d c a n be really cheep -
a n d y o u don't necessarily have to
m a k e a complex sauce to g o with it.
Pesto is the general name f o r a
paste, m a d e with olive o i l , garlic,
a n d either hard cheese o r nuts. You
can buy a basic green basil pesto in
a jar, from supermarkets. M a n y
shops also sell red pesto, which has
a d d e d tomato. You c a n mix pesto
straight in with pasta, for a g o o d
value, tasty meal.
Boil the pasta as described
above, adding a pinch of salt to the
water. After the pasta has been
c o o k e d for the time specified o n the
packet, drain the p a n . If possible,
a d d some butter of olive oil to the
pan, a n d mix into the pasta. Finally,
simply stir in about a tablespoon per
person of pesto.
Advanced Tip
Rosemary and Stilton Pesto
Rosemary a n d stilton c o m b i n e really
well in a pesto which is ideal with for
pasta, stuffing mushrooms, o r tick-
ing u n d e r the skin of chicken
breasts. M a k i n g pesto is great fun -
I'm sure there a r e scientific ways of
d o i n g it, but I normally just shove all
the ingredients in a blender. Just be
careful not to over-blend the stilton.
It is ideal to use o n e of those
mini food processors, o r a hand
blender with a n enclosed attach-
ment. For two people, blend the fol-
lowing, until smooth:
5 0 g Pine Kernels (or Cashews)
3 tablespoons Olive O i l
1 large c h o p p e d garlic clove
a small clump of fresh rosemary
a few drops of lemon juice
salt a n d pepper
To finish, c h o p 6 0 g of stilton into
small chunks, then a d d to the pesto.
Blend for a further 1 0 seconds.
