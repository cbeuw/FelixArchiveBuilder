Women's football at IC is about
fun, competition a n d team
work. W e welcome anyone, no matter
what your nationality, discipline or
ability, and strive to accommodate any
enthusiastic player.
The team competes in the U niver-
sity of London league and cup com-
petition on Sundays, and in the
national British Universities Sports
Association ( B U S A ) competition on
Wednesday afternoons. Last year w e
reached the quarter finals of the
B U S A competition, and the year
before we lost on penalties in the
semi-final of the U L U cup. A l ongside
the main competitions are a range of
five-a-side tournaments arranged by
other Universities which we also com-
pete in.
Moreover, we hope to d o even
better this year with the influx of more
medical and off-campus students into
what was previously a purely Imperial
team.
W e train once a week o n M o n -
day nights with a qualified football
coach to prepare for the games.
Wednesday nights are when the wom-
ens team gets together in the bar to
talk tactics and encourage team build-
ing through our shared love of beer.
W e are also keen to maintain relations
with the men's club - we have joint
Christmas and Annual Dinners, where
we get together to reminisce about
the seasons highs and lows.
So, when your course gets you
d o w n , and stress is at an all time high,
share the burden and take it out on
some other university o n the football
pitch. If you love football, fun and
frolics, join the womens football club
and enhance your time at Imperial
College.
For more information on the club
find us at the Freshers Fair (you'll find
our stall in the M D H ) , turn up for
training at midday on W e d nesday, or
contact this y e a r s captain, A n n e
Kerr, at anne.kerr@ic.ac.uk. Results,
fixtures and loads more useful info can
also be found on our website:
