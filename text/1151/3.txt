From simple measurements and balancing accounts to
binary code and financial markets, the world is forever
indebted to its humble brilliance. Just imagine trying to
solve a simple mathematical equation without the zero.
It is this type of creative thinking that we appreciate
at Goldman Sachs. But creativity isn't merely coming
up with a new idea. It is the dedication to bringing a
thorough and fresh approach to all of our clients'
rapidly developing financial needs.
As a leading investment banking and securities firm, we
use our knowledge and experience to advise and help our
clients to meet their strategic objectives, which ultimately
influences major change throughout the world.
At Goldman Sachs, more than 16,500 employees,
working in 41 offices in 23 countries, share a desire to
not only meet exemplary standards, but to set
new ones every day. It's been our hallmark for more
than 130 years.
