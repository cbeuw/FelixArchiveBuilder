The Sports Centre
For as l o n g as a n y o n e c a n r e m e m -
ber, Imperial C o l l e g e has b e e n try-
ing to construct a n e w Sports C e n -
tre. Since the farce which l e d to the
present building's current form (lack
of p l a n n i n g permission for Halls to
be built o n t o p only b e c a m e a p p a r -
ent after work o n the Sports C e n t r e
h a d begun) it has b e e n o b v i o u s that
a larger, i m p r o v e d facility w o u l d b e
necessary to fully a c c o m m o d a t e the
needs of the C o l l e g e community.
For starters, running a series of
smaller i n d o o r facilities - the s w i m -
m i n g p o o l , Southside G y m , the
Weights r o o m , the U n i o n G y m etc
is far less efficient than centralising
into o n e n e w venue (a situation
a n a l o g o u s to the sports g r o u n d
issue). C o n s e q u e n t l y , m a j o r cost
savings a n d service improvements
c o u l d b e m a d e by b u i l d i n g a n e w
unitary sports centre.
S e c o n d l y , there s i m p l y isn't
e n o u g h space at present. A l t h o u g h
most clubs a n d societies c a n just
about squeeze into the existing slots,
there's very little potential for a
"Sport for A l l " ethos in which a n y
r a n d o m g r o u p of students have a
decent c h a n c e of finding the facili-
ties they're after. M o r e o v e r , the
necessity for s o m e clubs to travel a
c o n s i d e r a b l e distance just to find a
suitable facility is hardly g o i n g to d o
w o n d e r s f o r participation levels.
O K , that's why it needs to b e
built - the next question is where...
Since the m i d eighties, a c o n -
stant stream of proposals, designs
a n d p l a n n i n g a p p l i c a t i o n s have
floated a r o u n d the C o l l e g e a n d the
local community, with a variety of
sites, styles, costs a n d facilities o n
offer at o n e time o r another - until
finally it seems that w e have s o m e -
thing o n the table which has the
potential to m o v e into practice.
Indeed, o n e of the C o l l e g e ' s most
powerful arguments is that they have
- quite generally - tried to fit the
Centre into every other o p e n (or not
so open) s p a c e o n c a m p u s . This is,
quite literally, the last option avail-
able...
The last major planning attempt
c a m e back in 1 9 9 6 . Having h a d
proposals for a c o m b i n e d sports
centre a n d halls d e v e l o p m e n t o n
t o p of the tennis courts next t o Lin-
stead turned d o w n , C o l l e g e realised
that the local residents h a d h a d
e n o u g h of IC's trademark concrete
block building motif, a n d w o u l d thus
only give permission to something
"in character". Consequently, the
designers took a large lateral step
a n d p r o p o s e d sinking the entire
centre - complete with a massive
nine court hall - under Princes G a r -
dens, possibly linking together the
existing s w i m m i n g p o o l with the ten-
nis courts (and beyond). Indeed it
was believed that the "Secret G a r -
d e n " (Princes G a t e G a r d e n s , behind
W e e k s Hall) w a s initially b o u g h t to
further this project. A l t h o u g h such a
scheme might n o w seem very far
etched,it's worth r e m e m b e r i n g that
it w a s drawn u p during the infancy
of lottery funding, when huge piles
of m o n e y were thrown at suspect
projects. Consequently, it w a s to
possible to fund such a massive
project.
This plan went to committee late
in A u t u m n 1 9 9 6 a n d , faced with
a r o u n d 2 7 0 objections from local
residents - w h o cited unacceptable
disruption during construction a n d
increased traffic w h e n the Centre re-
o p e n e d - it w a s flatly rejected...
A n d three years a n d a few other
(less fully developed) plans d o w n
the line, here w e a r e , awaiting the
o u t c o m e of the latest round of p l a n -
ning discussions.
So what's the d o w n s i d e ? Well,
building a n e w H a l l c o u l d m e a n the
loss of S o u t h s i d e G y m (the
timescale w o u l d fit in nicely with the
S o u t h s i d e r e d e v e l o p m e n t a n d
financing c o u l d , conceptually, be
f u n d e d by the sale of o n e of IC's
three sports g r o u n d s - a l t h o u g h the
senior staff involved all deny a direct
link. Anyway, that's a discussion for
another day...
