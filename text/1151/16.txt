iquid skin's the funky stuff that you c a n stick
on to your fingers for protection w h e n you
k n o w that they're g o i n g to get r i p p e d to
shreds by s o m e brutal a n d unforgiving guitar
strings. It's also an a p p r o p r i a t e title to attach to
the G o m e z s o u n d . W h i l e e a c h track is distinc-
tive a n d different in its o w n right, there's an
overall sonic a p p e a r a n c e that's hard not to
notice. It's this fluidity that is Liquid Skin's
strongest selling point.
F o l l o w i n g up o n Bring it On was never
g o i n g to be easy - massive sales a n d critical
success b a s e d a r o u n d a very distinctive a n d
idiosyncratic s o u n d is a h a r d act to follow, e s p e -
cially as the originality naturally seems to vanish
when you m o v e into s e c o n d a l b u m n territory.
N o n e t h e l e s s , Liquid Skin holds to the s a m e v a l -
ues that m a d e Bring it On a classic, a n d whilst
the o u t c o m e might not be o n quite the s a m e
p l a n e , it's still nice to see that chart success a n d
m a s s i v e e a r n i n g s h a v e n ' t d e n t e d G o m e ' s
proudly lo-tech s o u n d .
The b e g i n n i n g is s i g n a l l e d by H a n g o v e r , a
m e d i o c r e start that isn't d i s a p p o i n t i n g in that it
serves as a gentle ripple of what's to follow. Rev-
olutionary Kind p l o d s o n a n d builds itself up
m u c h in the s a m e way Whippin' Piccadilly did
on Bring It On, albeit in a less eclectic way. It's
certainly o n e that's easy for a u d i e n c e s to m a r c h
a l o n g to. The first of a few aural waves then
reaches a peak with the first single off the a l b u m
a n d p r o b a b l y the first to be n a m e d after your
previous a l b u m . O r was it the other way
a r o u n d ?
The musical high point is Rosalita, a c h a r m -
ing a n d addictive acoustic b a l l a d . "You've lost
your patience. I see myself sink in your estima-
tion. Just please talk to me. I won't portray
myself so pitifully," are lines that m a k e m o r e
sense a n d have more relevance to me than
" Y o u say it best w h e n you say nothing at a l l . "
Blue M o o n Rising sees the tide g o out under
cover of darkness. A t m o s p h e r i c a n d filled with a
kind of late night C o l o m b i a n m o o d i n e s s , it's
seductively attractive. Las Vegas D e a l e r then
heralds the b a n d s o u n d i n g like they're really
enjoying themselves a n d I think that this is the
key to their a p p e a l .
They're like the proverbial b i g g e r brother.
The y o u n g kid c o u l d g r a d u a t e with h o n o u r s ,
land a job with respect a n d shed-loads of
d o u g h but whenever there's a party or family
get-together, it's big brother with his happy exis-
tence that everyone seems to like a n d want to
have a chat with. G o m e z may not be heavy-
weight players but they have a w a r m c h a r i s m a
a b o u t them that m a k e s y o u want to keep on lis-
tening. You c a n take G o m e z or you c a n cut
them out. You don't have to have a clue of what
they're o n about. You c o u l d dismiss Liquid Skin
as Bring It On Again. But m e , I'll try anything
twice.
