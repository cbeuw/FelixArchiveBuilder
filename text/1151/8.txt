8 Sabbatical Manifestos Felix • 1 October 1999
Sabbatical Manifestos
At the request of the new Union President, Felix reprints this year's sabbatical manifestoes as a
reminder of what your representatives have promised to do in return for their £14 000 a year. How-
ever, political manifestoes are rarely written in plain English, so to make them easier to understand
we've passed the text through Felix's state of the art Acme Read-Between-The-Lines-O-Meter™.
ICU President Natasha Newton
3 0 0 words to say " m o r e of the g o o d , less of the
b a d " , still, if people are willing to read this, here's
what I think our Union's priorities should be.
[translation] I know thai getting elected has
nothing to do with manifesto promises...
1. Students
Every report the U n i o n makes within itself a n d
to the rest of the student body should start with what
is being done for us students, how we will benefit.
[translation] I'll show you all how great I am.
2. Students
The objectives for all meetings should be,
1. students
2. students
3. students
4. money, college's o p i n i o n . . . . (give o r take
legality and other minor matters).
[translation] Pot the students first. And second.
And third. But we need to make some money. And
we have to do what College tell us.
Simple example, Union people should contin-
ue helping correct budgets. After all which students
are helped if a club doesn't get its money.
[translation] But losing £36,000 on two sum-
mer ball is definitely in your interests...
3. Students
The facilities and activities of the Union a r e
available to all of us a n d that needs to be c o m m u -
nicated.
[translation] Please don't take away my sports
ground...
N a h , s**t, I a p p e a r to have mentioned c o m -
munication, here we g o , the standard unreal p r o m -
ises yet, year after year it barely gets better. But for
what it's worth, here are my practical ideas in a d d i -
tion to the obvious email, Felix a n d the Union struc-
ture.

Keep it simple! Like....
The hardware: As a c c o m m o d a t i o n officer, I a m ,
at the moment, arranging m o d e m s a n d PCs for Wil-
son House and seeing college about internal IC
lines. The same could happen in other outlying halls.
[translation] But none of my friends live in Eve-
lyn Gardens, so they can walk into College.
The info: Every week a list of the meetings tak-
ing place a n d some contact details needs posting
o n all U n i o n notice boards, in Felix a n d Stoic text.
Then if there's something that may affect you, you
have a chance to talk to the people involved a n d
find out the outcome.
[translation] You won't want to get involved so
I'll tell you what to do.
So thanks for reading a n d (this is the cheesy
bit...sorry) remember, a vote f o r T a s h a Newton is a
vote for students c o m i n g first. Contact 0 9 5 8 7 0 7

[translation! Help...too...many...jokes.
Deputy President (Clubs & Societies) - Tim Trailor
N e x t y e a r will b e o n e o f the m o s t c h a l l e n g i n g
years f a c e d by the DP ( C & S ) .
[translation] As I will have to clear up the
mess last years DP(C&S) left, ad the one
before, and the one before that etc. etc.
A l l c l u b s a n d s o c i e t i e s a r e f a c i n g a n
u p h e a v a l o f o n e k i n d o r a n o t h e r .
[translation] Be it moving into portacabins
or being forced to shut down as a result of not
following Health & Safety regulations.
M a n y of the s o c i e t i e s b a s e d in S o u t h K e n s -
i n g t o n will b e a c q u i r i n g n e w facilities c o u r t e s y
of the U n i o n s e x p a n s i o n into w h a t w a s until
recently the B i o l o g y d e p a r t m e n t ,
[translation] And the acquisition of a cou-
ple of s p o r t s fields courtesy of the
College...best not to mention them though.
But p r o b a b l y the b i g g e s t c l o u d still h a n g -
ing o v e r the h e a d o f next years DP (C&S) will
be the I C S M m e r g e r issue.

it is n o w a s i m p e r a t i v e a s ever that the u n i q u e
identity o f I C S M a n d I C U t e a m s is p r e s e r v e d .

London Gutteridge Cup competition.

medics, honest...
I h a v e b e e n well p l a c e d o v e r this past y e a r
to o b s e r v e w h a t y o u w a n t f r o m y o u r c l u b s a n d
s o c i e t i e s . I b e l i e v e that it is essential that next
years DP (C&S) is s o m e o n e with a g r e a t d e a l
of k n o w l e d g e c o n c e r n i n g the m e r g e r a n d t h e
p o s i t i o n that most s p o r t i n g c l u b s at Imperial
will f a c e o v e r t h e next 1 8 m o n t h s . A n y b o d y

[translation] Hockey, hockey, ra ra ra. Who
cares about those other clubs anyway?
I b e l i e v e that I h a v e g o t t h e n e c e s s a r y

resent t h e m well a l o n g with the d e s i r e t o listen
to a n d s u p p o r t the o t h e r c l u b s a n d s o c i e t i e s . It
is these q u a l i t i e s a l o n g with a p a s s i o n a t e
desire to d o this j o b , a n d d o it w e l l , that w o u l d
m a k e m e a n e x c e l l e n t c a n d i d a t e for the job -
so vote for m e for DP ( C & S ) !
[translation] I believe I have acquired the
necessary skills during my hockey career to
communicate with the other sports sabbaticals
in London during our drunken meetings, and
to pull whatever random teenagers I ULU
sports sabbaticals make themselves available
to me... Anyone seen any seventeen year old
girls?
