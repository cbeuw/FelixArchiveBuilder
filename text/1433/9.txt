A Hundred Million Sounds
Dylan Lowe discovers the real face of Fès, Morocco’s true capital of culture
C
lamours of morning
prayers filled our first-
floor bedroom. I checked
the time: it had just
passed six. Too early. The
piercing sunlight kept away any hope
of falling back to sleep; still I tumbled
back to a snooze, waking up two hours
later to sounds of the medina.
They were heavy raindrops rather
than chatters of Moroccans going
about their business.
Despite the discouragement, I got
out of bed.
Not that Fès had little to offer. Leg-
end (Lonely Planet, that is) has it that
the inhabitants of Fès go to bed every
night, knowing that their city is the
true centre of Morocco. Founded in
789 AD, Fès was established as the
capital of the first Moroccan imperial
dynasty and remained so for centuries.
Its intellectual, cultural, artistic and
religious advancements soared since
medieval times, even when its role as
political capital was in steady decline;
little wonder that Fassis (residents of
Fès) were widely regarded as the cul-
tural élite of Morocco.
A visitor would consider soaking up
in the elixir of artistic genius from the
entire city: with our tight schedule, we
disregarded the Ville Nouvelle and Fès
el-Jdid (New Fès) and headed straight
for Fès el-Bali, the Old Town of Fès,
which granted the city the status of the
largest living Islamic medieval city in
the world.
On the previous night we had stag-
gered, after an 11-hour coach ride,
into Fès el-Bali at its climax, instantly
hyped by its intoxicating charm of
Arabic commercialism; stepping out
of Hotel Cascade, the rain appeared to
have flushed out all forms of liveliness
from the hives.
After settling for a glass of mint tea
like a true Moroccan, I briefly left
Anna behind to explore the very souks
that are the essence of Old Fès.

Lahlou Ahmed didn’t own La Porte
du Peintre: his father did. Nor was he
responsible for the majority of paint-
ings exhibited in the miniscule gallery:
his father was. He had no obligations
to maintain the store ‒ arguably the
largest Talaa Seghira (one of Fès el-
Bali’s main alleys) ‒ save familial ties.
Which means a lot in Moroccan terms.
Still, he liked being there, surround-
ed by colours and aromas of oil paints.
It was a good break from his education
as a student in Arabic, yet not too great
a venture from the cultural enlighten-
ment he loved.
But today was just outright miser-
able. He stepped out for some fresh
air, head filled with the tunes and lyrics
he would sing when his friends came
around tonight. In his breath he cursed
the rain, for disrupting the rhythm and
fending off his customers.
“With art, there
was a third
option beside
‘you like it’ or
‘you dislike it’ -
‘you appreciate
it’”
That was when he saw the Asian kid
with the green t-shirt, blue waterproof,
swaggering down the street like an ad-
vertisement logo for shopkeepers.
And he seemed interested by the
artwork. And seeking shelter from the
downpour.
Effortlessly, Lahlou had himself a po-
tential buyer.
He gave him the space and time re-
quired for perusal, to his heart’s con-
tent. The holy-water man portrait,
by a travelling art student, caught his
eye. Lahlou smirked ‒ he knew that
look very well, one he had seen many
times from art-lovers who unearthed
his muse behind a piece of work, and
sensed that spark of connection.
He claimed he had a travel compan-
ion who would be delighted to visit
the shop: he had to go fetch her from
the hotel. The classic getaway excuse.
But no, he was too hooked to pitch an
escape. So Lahlou returned the hand-
shake, bid m’a ssalama willingly and
watched him burrow his way out of the
gallery.
Hard-selling was unnecessary: it was
because, Lahlou understood, with art,
there was a third option beside ‘you
like it’ or ‘you dislike it’ ‒ ‘you appreci-
ate it’.

I returned to Hotel Cascade and de-
livered the news of my discovery. Anna
was now more than determined to
buy a painting for her boyfriend; I too
found myself gradually succumbing to
the temptation to make the purchase.
Someone (or something) mentioned
how easy it is to lose yourself in the
medina. True, I discovered, yet not
because of its labyrinthine orientation.
“It was the
difficulty to
revisit a shop
as, distorted by
the many vibrant
sights you see
along the way,
your recollection
refused to
function, even
on one long
straight path.”
For a distance that took me less than
ten minutes ‒ or so I thought ‒ Anna
and I needed twice as much. With the
rain diminishing by the minute, locals
and tourists alike had ruptured out of
their cocoons and restoring life to the
souks. Perhaps that did no favours to
my orientation skills.
We found La Porte de Peintre even-
tually. Lahlou welcomed me and my
companion with open arms, once
again left us in our silent admiration
on volumes of masterpieces arranged
across the walls.
In the end, Anna settled for two
paintings, and I the portrait that had
captured my heart. With our new-
gained bargaining skills, harvested
when in Casablanca and Marrakesh,
we came out from the bartering game
with a decent price. As Lahlou dis-
mantled the canvases for transport, we
got down to a hearty conversation and
gained insight to each other’s lives.
He revealed to me his involvement in
a local Moroccan music band.
“Come back at eight tonight when
my friends and I play music here. We
will be honoured to have your com-
pany, sadik.”
Promises aside, we paid and depart-
ed with three fantastic pieces of art,
and a new friend. Curious enough, it
was roughly when the sun broke out
from elusion.

Mohammed was idle. The Talaa Ke-
bira was bustling with life ‒ there just
weren’t enough tourists.
There were at least two gawking at
the majesty that was Medersa Bou Ina-
nia. Perfect targets.
Ensha’llaah, he thought as he ap-
proached for the kill; they will want to
continue shopping rather than visiting
the Medersa.
“Excuse me, can I help?”
They seemed unthreatened. He went
ahead to the doorkeeper to probe the
entrance fee of the Medersa, when they
expressed their doubts about visiting
the college. Returning with the infor-
mation, Mohammed had established
some mutual trust.
And now for the killer question.
“Would you like to buy some spices?”
He had struck a harmony. Before
they could gesture their approval,
he guided them through a back alley
where his cousin’s shop was tucked
neatly behind a corner. The shopkeep-
ers sprang to life at the sight of new
customers, briskly led them through
an introductory on their goods.
Mohammed kicked back on a couch,
watched bemusedly as the Asian bloke
poked his nose on samples of cu-
min and spice mixes, and his Cauca-
sian lady friend pursued inquisitively
on massage oils. The bill continued
mounting ‒ he felt satisfaction for not
only gratifying his guests, but also the
tip that awaits.
They were on the move with their
bounty. He fumbled around his djella-
ba pocket for his prized photography,
only to realise he had left it behind. He
cursed under his breath ‒ only if he
could show it off and tell tales of his
getting stoned with Bono only a week
ago…

Andrew and Kag, fellow hitchers we
Courtyard of Medersa Bou Inania
had met on the previous night, ren-
dezvoused with us by the entrance of
Hotel Cascade. As we exchanged en-
counters of our wanders over mint tea,
I made the suggestion.
Truth to be told, having lived
through the disappointment of missing
the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca,
third-largest of its kind in the world, an
Islamic architectural experience at the
Medersa Bou Inania was not too much
to ask. Especially when we hadn’t had
the chance (and privilege) to visit a
mosque.
Not that the theology college was a
mere substitute. Constructed by the
Merenid Sultan Bou Inan, it repre-
sented the Merenid Dynasty’s (1276 -
1465) excellence in Berber craftsman-
ship. Also a mosque, it once housed
some of the brightest minds in Muslim
theology.
My craving was now fulfilled. Stuffed
were my eyes with imageries of shades
arranged in tiles or perfect symmetry,
rising in columns that transformed
into plastered pillars, every inch dedi-
cated with engraving of Islamic sym-
bols; they then converged into the
elaboration and splendour that was the
wooden layering.
Waiting patiently for the tourist to
disperse, I seared the already-frozen
scene into my camera. Although I be-
lieve some sights are better committed
to memory than a snapshot, a good
memoir might come into handy when
my memory decides to fail me.

‘Crazy man’ was crazy because of his
frantic salesmanship, not because he
was genuinely crazy. He was passionate
for his job, and loyalty to his employer
and Thami’s Restaurant (Bou Jeloud,
50 Serrajine, The Medina). Come rain
or come shine, he would wave around
the sheets detailing Lonely Planet’s rec-
ommendation for the eatery, attracting
patrons to the two tables it hosted.
Not around this time though. It was
too early for dinner.
But then, this boy with his green t-
shirt emerged with a funny request.
“Can we take our food to our hotel
terrace?”
He felt no need for hesitation. Taking
order for four portions of tagines, one
of couscous, he whisked together all
ingredients in the undersized kitchen
and distributed them to individual tag-
ines, with the precision and haste he
would commit to any dish.
“Please bring the tagine pots back
after you’ve finished?” He had to make
sure. Any piece of the terracotta may
be worth more than his daily salary ‒
losing one would mean financial disas-
ter, let alone four. He could only wait,
distraught nevertheless; but he could
only wait.
Soon enough, the teens had brought
back the crockery with satisfaction
smeared across their lips.
That was exactly why ‘crazy man’ was
passionate for his job.

Flipping through my guidebook, I
came across a piece of intriguing infor-
mation: that Fès hosts the Festival of
World Sacred Music every June, since
1995. Approaching eight, marching
down Talaa Seghira with an entourage
of seven (I found three more hitchhik-
ers earlier during the day), I knew I was
on for a treat.
It was bound to be a very private
concert, minus the intimidation and
plus the interaction, with some very
special music indeed.
Knowing that we would be disorien-
tated in the dark, Lahlou came further
up the Talaa to lead us into his sanc-
tuary. Soon enough, room became an
issue when Lahlou’s friends arrived,
and the crowdedness that generated
awkwardness. Most of us fell short of
words.
The language barrier collapsed once
the music started to swing, and us
rocking to its thunderous beats. The
longest night had begun, the room
smoke-filled and distorting before
our eyes; I became, my intolerance of
stereotypes aside, Lahlou’s Jet Li for
the occasion, and laughed along to his
playfulness.
It certainly was a saga that I would
not want to end.
