“His profession

A
s a general rule, it is very
difficult to look suave
while trying to lift con-
gealed peas off a plate
with a plastic fork. The
difficulty is compounded when the
peas in question are on a plane hover-
ing somewhere over the continent and
the plate seems eager to make landfall
a few precious seconds before the table
does.
The herculean labour of consuming
this notoriously tricky foodstuff with-
out causing yourself too great an em-
barrassment is not made easier when
your dinner has become a spectator
sport. On whatever criteria the judges
would have awarded marks, however,
my neighbour would doubtlessly have
won. I have never before seen anyone
dip pitta bread in tehina while wearing
cufflinks, and I couldn’t help but feel
privileged to have a front row seat at a
demonstration of such showmanship
and legerdemain.
“So,” he asked suddenly, causing me
to drop half my rice onto my lap. “Why
are you flying?”
“My sister’s getting married tomor-
row,” I replied, hastily brandishing my
fork as I knocked over a glass of coke.
“I see,” he said icily, handing me a
napkin while he brushed grains of rice
off his shirt. “Well. I hope you have a
nice time.” He replaced his earphones
and meaningfully shot his cuffs.
I was going abroad for literally 48
hours in order to take a break from my
revision and to hold up one of the four
corners of my sister’s chuppah - the
traditional Jewish bridal canopy. It’s
not that they couldn’t get a pole, you
understand, the couple merely thought,
after careful consideration, that I might
be more decorative. And cheaper than
importing foreign labour. I jest, I jest,
fear not. The only reason I give myself
license to indulge in such a hoary old
joke (that I wouldn’t normally touch
with Josef ‘Stretch’ Pulaski - a ten-foot
pole) is that it serves as a neat segue to
the topic of my family. A family which,
it goes without saying, is bursting at the
seam with Poles.
The subtle socio-political and econo-
geographical intrigues that character-
ise my family will be grist for a different
mill. What I feel needs to be clarified,
however, is that my family tree now
closely resembles Ficus aurea, the rain-
forest parasite whose tendrils envelop
the loose branches of neighbouring
plants. Whereas most families take
pride in the vertical majesty of their
genealogies, we, like most Jews, glory
in our family’s lateral spread. The sheer
chaos makes any attempt to distinguish
blood relatives utterly meaningless.
Anyone who has ever been close to the
family has been swallowed into it, and
that goes for ex-husbands, step-chil-
dren, friends, colleagues and in-laws.
All of which mean that last Friday,
the family tree was about to acquire a
new graft. My sister’s newly-acquired
husband is a string theorist and phys-
ics professor at Tel Aviv university. The
fact that I myself am studying physics is
no coincidence, as it was my decision
to come here that got my sister chat-
ting to members of the physics faculty
at Tel Aviv. It was while engaging with
this rarefied bunch that she became en-
gaged to a bright young physicist and
tennis enthusaist.
While it’s fantastic to have a profes-
sional physicist in your family (espe-
cially come exam time), there are cer-
tain unavoidable drawbacks. To name
one, it makes any escape from physics
impossible, even at the supposedly safe
haven of my sister’s wedding.
“Ah! You must be Gilead!” cried a
balding man with a large cowboy hat
as he crossed the garden where the re-
ception was being held. His profession
couldn’t have been more obvious if he’d
tattooed ×E=-∂B/∂t on his forearm.
“I hear you’re doing physics at Imperi-
al” he said, motioning to his colleagues
with a peremptory gesture. I nodded
nervously as the swarm converged.
“We’ve got some very good people at
Imperial” he announced.
“Very good,” echoed an older woman
with a thick Polish accent.
“What’s his name - Zulotkin?”
“Tcherneyev,” she prompted.
“Ah yes, excellent theorist. You know
him?” I quietly shook my head as I
sipped from my glass of lemonade. Si-
lence. He cleared his throat. It seemed
to take forever. I flicked my eyes hope-
fully up at the sky. My prayers were
soon answered as the wedding plan-
ner, informal-ceremony-conductor and
good friend of my sister called me to
hold up the chuppah.
As I stood under the canopy with the
parents and assorted siblings, I joined
the seventy or so guests in smiling un-
controllably as my sister permanently
pledged her troth to a physicist.
“We vow to cherish and protect,” they
intoned in Hebrew, “to love and honour
each other. We thank God for his bless-
ings and you for yours.” I wiped a silent
tear as they added the traditional coda:
“may the force be with you.” Yes, my sis-
ter really was marrying a physicist.
I
t began in my childhood.
Amongst the toys and the games
and the cartoons, there were two
figures that stood out. Two pin-
nacles of coolness. I am of course
speaking about James Bond and Indi-
ana Jones. I couldn’t have picked more
polar opposites in facial if I had tried.
James Bond, the quintessential Eng-
lish spy. On the silver screen, he was
smart and suave, saving the world with
an immaculate suit and a license to kill.
And he was always clean-shaven – that
was a must. After all, could you really
trust the defence of the realm to some-
one that couldn’t take care of their fa-
cial follicles? (The answer is no.)
And then you have Indiana Jones –
Jonesy, Junior, Dr. Jones, call him what
you like. He was a swashbuckling ar-
chaeologist with a wide-brimmed hat
and bull-whip – the stuff young boys’
dreams are made of. And his beard –
the stubble you can light matches off
– was part of the appeal.
Bond and Jones – the two greatest
heroes in a young boy’s mind. Both
constantly jet off to exotic locales, both
mix it up mediaeval with the bad guys,
both get the girl (Or sometimes, girls).
Many a Saturday afternoon was spent
pretending I was one or the other, re-
enacting their adventures or creating
my own. Ah, the wonders of the imagi-
nation! But what does this have to with
beards? Trust me, I’m getting there.
Fast-forward a few years to the dif-
ficult adolescent period and I begin to
sprout my own soup-strainer. Admit-
tedly, it was nothing more than peach-
fuzz to begin with but I grew, and my
beard grew with me. It was something
I could take pride in. But I was even-
tually faced with a conundrum. I had
occasionally experimented with the
contents of my father’s shaving cabinet
– just to keep it in shape – but with the
prospect to shaving routinely, a choice
presented itself to me.
To beard or not to beard? Not even
Hamlet could resolve this.
It had boiled down to who I’d rather
emulate. 007, with his well-defined
naked chin, or Henry Jones, Jr., with
his daringly unkempt cheeks. As I’ve
already shown, both men are clearly
winners. Travel, adventure, and girls
– three things which I yearned for
in my youth. (In fact, I still yearn for
them – but the proportions have now
changed). By a whisker, Indiana Jones
won over. Perhaps it was the appeal to
a more lax regimen. Maybe it was the
association with hunting Nazis (I re-
main rather ambivalent to Simon Wie-
senthal’s moustache). But there was no
denying the fact that while Bond was
smooth, Jones was rugged.
So I proceeded to let my beard grow
as nature intended, intermittently
trimming when birds began to nest
in the sideburns. I was thoroughly
pleased with my rugged appearance,
knowing that it would be an instant hit
with the “ladies”. I reached the conclu-
sion “Girls like rugged stubble” without
consulting the dictionary, or anyone of
the female population. After all, I was
fifteen. I clearly knew all there was to
be known about the rules of attraction.
A rugged appearance involves, as
well as the obligatory beard, a touch
of the wild, a body chiselled by work,
and a faintly misogynistic smile. Un-
fortunately, I forgot to take these
into account. I thought that my stun-
ning teenage terminal hairs would be
enough by itself. How wrong I was.
Turns out that a lanky youth in a rain-
coat is not what turns girls on.
Only after several rejections and one
attempt to hunt me for sport (Don’t
ask) did I slowly begin to revise my
original assumption. I looked around
me and the only other be-stubbled
gent around me was my father, and
the only woman he ever pulled was my
mother (Not that I have a right to com-
plain). Horrified at becoming the en-
emy, I dispensed with the razor blade
and tore the excess hair from my face
with my bare hands. Fear makes us do
very stupid things.
So here I am now at Imperial. I have
forsaken the hedonistic hirsutism of
my younger days. My shadow rarely
last longer than a few days now but I
still gaze wistfully at the figure in the
mirror, idly dreaming of finding the
Ark of the Covenant hidden in the
labyrinthine passages of Central Li-
brary. My hand on the razor falters and
I wonder whether I can pull off “that”
look this time. That’s when the words
of my friend (Who is of the feminine
persuasion) come back to me. “Oh, no.
Beards are itchy; I’d never kiss a guy
with a beard.”
I drop the razor...and rip the bastards
out instead.
For Rhys Davies, beards are a prickly issue.
