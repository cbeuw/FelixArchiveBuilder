serving a proper full pint”. As already
mentioned, the main problem that
was outlined in the survey was the
customer service; however, they all
seemed to be targeted at a handful of
the staff. The major criticism was that
a few of the staff were “just too slow” to
customers and that “the bar staff didn’t
really understand what I was ordering.
How hard can it be to make a Gin and
Tonic?”.
In his manifesto last year, Deputy
President (Finance & Services), Chris-
tian Carter, stressed the need to im-
prove the standard of service at Impe-
rial College Union. When presented
with the results of this survey, Mr
Carter told felix that
“We welcome the results of this sur-
vey as part of our continuing effort to
engage our students and better under-
stand their views on our services. Since
taking office, catering has been one
area I have worked with Union staff
on to improve. The evening menu, as
your survey shows, is well liked and
received by our students. The process
behind the change of our evening offer
is something I’ve been working on this
year to help bring to our lunchtime
service.”
“Currently we run our lunchtime
service as a loss leader offset by oth-
er trading areas, the evening service
isn’t. We have proved that an evening
service can be both profitable and well
received by the students and I look
forward to working with our staff and
next years Sabbs to institute positive
change. The third phase of our build-
ing redevelopment which focuses on
our ground floor trading outlets, will
allow us to revaluate what our students
require form their Union and we will
be seeking further feedback on exactly
what it is they want before this phase
starts.”
Every year, the candidates that take
part in the Sabbatical elections com-
ment on the quality of the service of-
fered by both the bars and the catering
service, however, many have yet to see
any one of them fulfil their promise of
change. Both Ashley Brown and Dan-
iel Hill, who are President elect and
Deputy President (Finance & Services)
elect, have promised that they will im-
prove the services, just as their pred-
ecessors have in the past. This reporter
hopes that eventually, one of them will
keep to their promise.

A favourite amongst the student
population for it’s quick service,
cheap prices (although they have
just recently gone up) and filling
sandwiches. Despite the name,
they do sell some other stuff, but
it’s mainly the sandwiches that
people love.
There are many other smaller
café’s around campus where
you can get most of the College
food, however, with the closure
of the Main Dining Hall until next
term, there is a severe shortage
of locations where one can get a
proper cooked lunches.
This is one area where the Un-
ion can now say they have the
advantage, yet the survey clearly
shows that the food and the serv-
ice can be vastly improved. The
real question is what is going
to be done about it and will the
eventual new design of the Un-
ion bring in an era of change and
improvement to the services.
R
ude. Arrogant. Lazy. Un-
enthusiastic. Plain Rub-
bish. These are just a few
of the phrases used by the
students of Imperial to de-
scribe the bar and catering services
provided by Imperial College Union.
In a recent survey of 184 students car-
ried out by felix, it was found that 77%
of students were unhappy with the
quality of the service they were being
provided with.
Imperial College Union has put in a
lot of time and money into improving
the range of goods that are on offer,
with a major revamp of the bars and
catering services done last summer.
The result; a wider range of beers on
offer as well as an energetic and all en-
compassing evening menu. They even
paid to have the walls in both daVinci’s
and dB’s redone in an attempt to revi-
talise the areas and move it away from,
as one student described, a “hospital
canteen”. Even though they may have
achieved this, the quality of the goods
that are produced are “only as good as
the people who serve it”, as one student
put it.
In the survey, the students were
asked to also point out what they
thought was the main problem with
each of the services. For the catering,
the main problem was the inconsistent
quality of the food that was provided
on a daily basis; one student described
the quality of the food as ranging from
“plastic meat in stale bread to some-
thing that is actually edible”. Asked to
rate the quality of the food from one
star to four stars (four stars being the
highest), the students gave an average
rating of two stars. Whilst the quality
could be improved upon, the portions
that were given out were considered
to be quite good, getting an average
rating of three stars. The price of the
food on offer, however, was split with
opinions from both sides, some think-
ing that the prices were good for the
portion size, whilst other thought that
the price was too much for the quality
of the food.
Earlier this year, felix managed to
get hold of photographs of the quality
of some of the kitchen facilities in the
Union. As can be seen by the picture
on the front page, the quality of one of
the kitchens could only be described
as a germ factory; however, the Un-
ion has claimed that that particular
kitchen has not been used for over a
year and that their kitchens are kept to
a very high standard. To verify this, fe-
lix decided to do a surprise visit to the
kitchens in daVinci’s, which are known
to definitely be in use, and found out
that they were surprisingly clean.
Despite the fact that the kitchens are
actually extremely clean, the quality of
the food that they produce still seems
below par in the eyes of the students
that they serve. Not only is the quality
of the food inconsistent, but the survey
also showed that 77% thought that the
service offered by the staff was poor
with such comments as “the staff al-
ways seem grumpy” and “very unhelp-
ful”. Even more worrying is what one
student said. He told felix that “they
never seem to know what is in the food
which is a problem if you have food al-
lergies, and if you do ask, they always
seem to give you a snide comment!”
Some of the more rather entertain-
ing outcomes from the survey includ-
ed 80% of students thinking that they
could cook better food than what the
Union had to offer, but when asked
why they still come here, their reason-
ing was obvious. “Home is too far from
College” said one student. “The Union
is convenient and it is the only alterna-
tive to College food” said another 3rd
year mathematician. But what seemed
to be the underlying point was that
many of the students, just couldn’t be
“arsed” to cook food themselves.
Another interesting fact was that
71% of the students questioned, were
under the assumption that the Union
was making a profit on the lunch-time
menu when felix can reveal that they
in fact make a loss of about £40,000 a
year. This could be partly due to pay-
ing £1.50 for a head of Iceberg lettuce
or, the more likely option, due to the
number of staff working the shift. All
of the negative comments from the
students were mainly focused around
the lunch time staff and menu at the
Union. In total contrast to the lunch
results, the opinion of the evening
menu was far better, with the only
criticism being the inconsistency of
the food, however, Mr Carter told felix
that.
On the other hand, the bars have re-
ceived a better review, with the main
problem being the quality of the cus-
tomer service provided by a minority
of the staff. The problems highlighted
by the students were minor, such as
“not showing me how much I was be-
ing charged for on the card” and “not

And Finally: Cornish upset over inbred
joke from RSM, again!
Jack Cornish
Yep, he is Cornish
Student loan interest rates
fall to 0% from September
Student loans taken out after 1998 will
see their interest rate fall to 0% for the
year from 1st September 2009, due to
a decrease in the Retail Prices Index
(RPI). However, the Government has
used a “get-out” in the relevant legis-
lation to avoid setting an interest rate
of -0.4%, which would have seen loans
pay themselves off.
The post-1998 rate has previously
been set to the lowest of the base rate
of major British banks or the RPI from
the previous March, on a one year cy-
cle starting in September.
For September 2009 this would have
seen the rate set to -0.4%, the March
2009 RPI. It was widely expected that
the Government would avoid setting
an interest-paying rate, which they
I
t’s a popular pastime of Impe-
rial students to grumble about
the quality of the bar-staff at
the Union. As a member of that
much pilloried section of Impe-
rial society, allow me to address some
of the concerns about the people that
serve you drinks in daVincis.
Before I begin, lets make sure that
we have all the facts in order. The staff
are almost entirely made up of Impe-
rial students, your peers, and most of
the staff at present have been working
for almost a year or more. Put simply,
we’re experienced and on top of this,
the job isn’t particularly difficult. It
might be boring and tiring, certainly,
but it’s not difficult.
With that in mind, allow me to
address two of the most common
complaints.
1. The staff are rude.
The bar-staff are students, your
peers. In fact, most are 3rd or 4th year
students, so excuse us if we don’t call
you ‘Sir’. Also you may not have no-
ticed but you’re quite annoying when
drunk…
2. The staff are slow.
The staff aren’t slow. During busy
events such as the Christmas Ball or
Summer Ball, and during the exam
season, we often have better things to
do such as party or revise. The bar be-
comes understaffed and as a result the
Union hires external ‘agency staff’ who
have basically never worked in a bar
before. The main consequence is that
service is very slow.
In any case, I’d advise that the qual-
ity of service at the bar is perhaps not
the most important issue in the world.
And if your stuck in a particularly long
queue, it’s perfect conversation materi-
al with the cute girl waiting beside you.
Finally, if you’ve ever wondered why
you’ve been passed over in the drinks
queue, it’s either because you’re being
an obnoxious boar or more simply,
you were standing beside the barman’s
mate.

A view from
the other side
of the bar
S
o, we are all students here,
and for the most part, our
days revolve around sleep,
work, beer, food and the oc-
casion call to you mother to
tell her that you are getting enough of
the aforementioned quantities (well
perhaps not the beer). Being students,
and supposedly self-supportive, we
all quickly learn to love Sainsbury’s’
reduced section. I remember in my
first year I would actually factor in the
22.55pm trip to ensure that I procured
the best deals, and by deals I mean
food that will be going off in an hour
and five minutes. Yet still, for some ob-
scure reason we will buy that pizza not
because we like the topping, but be-
cause is has a whopping 45p off. That’s
a lot to a student, buy four, eat one,
freeze the rest and use the spare cash
to buy a pint. So when it comes to food
we all know what we want- cheap, lots,
and it’ll be an added bonus if its doesn’t
resemble cardboard.
Understandably we get pissed when
we do spend our hard lent cash on
what can only be described as shit.
And the source of this shit? The Un-
ion, look at our survey 77% of people
think that the service is terrible. Once
last year I brought a coffee, as you do.
Yet this time, with the night before still
raging in my head I managed to spill it
all over the cashiers table, scalding my
hand and losing half of my coffee in the
process. What did I get for this? A free
refill? No. A severe bollocking. I was
the one losing out! I wanted to jump
over the counter and nut him. But
then I thought no, best not, my tummy
hurts and I may vomit. And that nicely
brings me onto my next subject.
I am yet to find a Student Union that
has any Michelin stars, and fortunately
Charles Murdoch
Food and Drink
we don’t yet offer Turkey Twizzlers,
so I think Jamie Oliver will be mildly
uninterested in cooking for us. Also,
each one of us must admit to a trip
to Burger King to demolish some re-
claimed meat, or occasionally praying
to the porcelain God in the sky because
we can’t handle our drink. We don’t re-
ally treat our bodies in way our moth-
ers would be proud. So why should
the Union be forking out on expensive
100% beef burgers (that still taste shite)
and passing the cost onto us? All we re-
ally want is hot, cheap and reasonable
tasting food, preferably lots. I am infu-
riated when I buy my lunch and then
have to go back to buy second lunch
because I am still hungry. And no, I am
not a chunky motherfucker, 5’11” and
11.5 stone actually. Nobody comes to
the Union and expects ‘seared Orkney
scallops’, but we do expect reasonable
quality food at a reasonable price. Last
Tuesday the salmon on offer looked so
atrocious we wouldn’t even stump up
the £3.20 to buy it for photographic
purposes. And to those people who did
eat it I wish a full and speedy recovery.
Lastly the Union should be filled at
lunchtime, it’s our Union and should
cater directly for us, but it’s neither.
Everyone flocks to the JCR where it
appears that cheap, quality, filling food
is available. However, each Monday of
Freshers’ week, the Union is thronged
with Freshers’ who know no better. Af-
ter that, silent. If that isn’t a big fucking
red sign pointing out that what they
are feeding us, and what we are being
charged is shit then they all need their
heads reading.
For good food, my best advice is to
invest in a wool jumper, grow a beard
and sneak into the SCR. You don’t feel
the staff want to assassinate you either.

have done by neglecting to set a rate
at all. The effect of not setting a rate
means loans will attract no interest, a
rate of 0%.
Numbers aside, it means the Gov-
ernment has been happy to take mon-
ey from students when the RPI was in
its favour, but has avoided reducing
the size of their loans now the tables
have turned. Figures released this week
show RPI falling even further, to -1.2%,
meaning the deal is even worse than
when originally announced.
Despite students losing out, the NUS
President, Wes Streeting, welcomed
the 0% rate, saying
“In the context of a recession, this
is the best deal students and gradu-
ates could have expected. NUS will
continue to monitor the rate of inter-
est on student loans, and make sure
the Government is aware of students’
concerns.”
Until recently student loans had al-
ways adopted the RPI from the previ-
ous March, the rate changing every
September to reflect this. This had
a severe effect a couple of years ago,
where the RPI doubled from 2.4% to
4.8% in the space of a year. When the
Bank of England base rate dropped be-
low the March 2008 RPI at the start of
the year, the Student Loans Company
dropped the rate month-on-month to
reflect this.
A petition has been set up on the
Number 10 website, calling for the
Prime Minister to restore the link
to RPI and set a -0.4% interest rate:

Every year since 1902 the Royal School
of Mines and the Camborne School of
Mines have fought for the mighty bot-
tle that is currently placed behind the
Union Bar after RSM were victorious in
the latest rugby match hosted here in
London. The final score was 14-10 and
‘the bottle returned home’. The match
has developed into a weekend’s worth
of activities including other sports and
dinners with the accompanying rivalry.
Jokes and banter, on the whole, remain
harmless and are taken with good spirit
but there have been instances in the
past which have caused complaints.
The obligatory annual t-shirt that ac-
companies the weekend often points
fun at the Cornish and the pitch side
banter towards the Camborne play-
ers is part of the cause, but some take
it too much to heart. Or are they over
reacting?
The most recent development in this
saga is a facebook group named ‘Grae-
me Hicks is and idiot, and CSM are still
inbred’ created by Richard Simons, who
one can only assume meant ‘…an idi-
ot…’ in his inspiring title. For those that
don’t know, Graeme Hicks is Leader of
Kerrier District Council and Member
of the Cornish County Council and has
previously complained about the RSM
hockey website which has the follow-
ing introduction, ‘The Royal School of
Mines Hockey Club follows in a long
line of RSM sporting prowess but most
of all its about fun, drinking and beat-
ing the pulp out of little Cornish in-
breds who like to call themselves min-
ers’. Personally, as a ‘Cornish inbred’ I
do not find this particularly offensive
and I will put all three hands in the air
and say it does not bother me or my
two headed sister. However this report-
er does see his point, as did the Union.
Stephen Brown, then ICU President,
and Prof. Buckingham, the Pro-Rector
of Imperial, both made a formal apol-
ogy and tried to rescue RSM and more
importantly Imperial from any more
embarrassment and damaging com-
ments about the college.
However, the recent facebook group
is unnecessary. Especially an ‘open
group’ to which anyone can join…an-
other instance of technically minded
people without an ounce of common
sense. Even or own ICU President-
elect, Ashley Brown, is a member,
when only last year Stephen Brown had
been called to resign over the matter!
Not only do we have RSM’s reputa-
tion under threat, but also the whole
of Imperial College where we all work
hard to get a good degree from a highly
regarded university to then get a job.
What the
students think!
Imperial Medical student on hunger strike
at Tamil protests on Parliament Square
Thousands of protestors have gath-
ered outside the Houses of Parliament,
holding a vigil for the killed leader of
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam,
including a student from our very own
Medical School.
Several protestors have also taken
to hunger strikes, including Karthika
Shantha, a 21-year-old ICSM student.
Commenting to the Independent about
the small group of demonstrators who
were arrested recently, Ms Shantha
said:
“There were a small number of young
men who were reacting violently to the
police. We kept trying to tell them to
stop it and stay peaceful. The police
responded by pushing us and hitting
us. I saw a couple of girls get hit on the
chest.”
After hearing that the Tamil Tiger
leader Vellupillai Prabhakaran had
been shot dead, thousands descend-
ed upon Parliament Square where
they managed to blockade the roads.
Amongst all the commotion, ten Tamil
demonstrators were arrested whilst
twenty-one officers were injured.
In a powerful message over the
scenes that are currently occurring in
Sri Lanka, Ms Shantha went on to say
that: “We will stay because we are not
just here for the LTTE. We are here
for the Tamil civilians. The war might
have stopped but they are still dying
everyday.”
“Britain and the international com-
munity must make sure that Sri Lanka
provides for the innocent civilians.”
Portion Size
Price of Food
Catering Service
Bar Service
The bar staff
received better
reviews, however,
the main com-
plaint was the slow
service, especially
on busy nights.
There’s no
denying it, the
students think the
service is rubbish,
singling out one
member of staff in
particular.
Split decision
really. Those
that thought the
portion size was
big thought and
that the quality
was OK, thought
the price was
fair. Those who
thought the qual-
ity was poor, regardless of the portion
size thought the price was too much.
Can’t please everyone I guess!
A resounding ma-
jority believe that
you get a lot on
your plate, but not
all of the students
think that it’s good
stuff on the plate.
It really depends
what you order.

can be OK, whilst
