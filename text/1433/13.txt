What is Bestival?
Bestival takes place at Robin Hill - a country park close to Downend
and Newport on the Isle of Wight. It essentially was created by Rob da
Bank and his Sunday Best record label. Rob da Bank has “ten fun years of
pioneering music events and record releases”
The BBC Radio 1 DJ had a vision to create what he thought the “mod-
ern day” festival should be. With the help of his wife Josie da Bank and
his partners John and Ziggy that dream is now a reality, culminating in
one of the exciting yearly festivals about.
Bestival is a special place. It may just have something to do with the
dreams, ideas and ambition of Rob and Josie da Bank. With an electri-
fying line up, and huge names the promising set will be accompanied
by amazingly fun experience. With many side events such as “the Bol-
lywood Cocktail Bar, fancy dress en mass and even a Hidden Disco”
Bestival has been around since 2004, and every year has produced
superb lineup to make even the biggest festivals jealous. This has
resulted in the Bestival winning three awards including “Best Me-
dium Sized Festival” www.bestival.net
Who are we looking forward to?
Who is felix interested in seeing at Bestival? Well as you can see from the huge line up, there are so
many great bands. One could just put the headliners up, and that would be enough to warrant the
£150 price tag for the festival. So here it is:
Massive Attack / Kraftwerk / Elbow
MGMT / Seasick Steve / Fleet Foxes
Klaxons / Bat For Lashes / Lily Allen
Soulwax / Doves / 2manydjs
However there are so many acts, it won’t be possible to see them all. So who are we
most looking forward to see? and who are a must attend on the band checklist? Now
If I had another page I would list everyone’s opinions, but right now, I’m going to list
mine. Personally I’m looking forward to see Little Boots, Beardyman, Soulwax,
2manydjs and Caspa.
When Deputy Editor Kadhim Shubber was asked he said “MGMT, Florence
and the Machine, Buraka Som Sistema, The Big Pink, Kraftwerk, all
of the DJs including Rob da Bank and Beardyman”

As with any festival, you need to be
prepared for almost any outcome.
However I think some things are
finnier if your not prepared. So I have
included here the bear essentials. Any-
thing else like sunglasses and a change
of clothes is just something you’ll have
to decide for yourself.
For a bargain, you can pick up a
two man tent from Decathlon for
only £20. It’s one of those popup
ones and is so cheap you
can burn leave it at the
end of the festival.
So that’s the only help we’re
going to give you. Thank you
and have a nice trip.
