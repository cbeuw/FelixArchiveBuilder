A
s we slowly approach
the summer, the heat
between the Palm Pre
and the rumoured new
iPhone gets more in-
tense. Tech blogs, forums and Twitter
are flooded with spec lists, suppos-
edly leaked photos and iPhone-vs.-Pre
polls, while Windows Mobile stirs up
little interest with their forthcoming
release.
Having been an iPhone (2G) user
for more than a year now I must say I
am very impressed with Apple’s little
gem, but the limitations still annoy me
every now and then. This obviously in-
cludes the lack of fast data connection
and GPS which are available on the 3G
model, but I have more on my list: no
video recording, crap camera quality,
no Bluetooth file transfer, no A2DP
(Bluetooth stereo audio), and - worst
of all - no FM radio (podcasts just can’t
replace live programmes).
Ironically, all the above problems do
no exist in most other smartphones,
especially the latest ones from HTC,
which is why I decided to give the HTC
Touch HD a go a few months back:
the screen was great (despite one dead
spot), loved the removable battery,
good camera quality, enjoyed the FM
radio and GPS. Sadly, the disappoint-
ing video playback performance alone
was bad enough to force me back to
the iPhone again.
This is no iPhone fanboyism. I had
been an HTC user for at least five
years, ranging from the very first xda
to the xda Exec. In between I tried a
Symbian phone (the Sendo X) once
but was instantly put off by the slug-
gish performance, and there had been
little improvement on the Symbian OS
since then. I was also a Sony Ericsson
user for a little while when my budget
was low, but was surprised by the large
user group who offered a range of apps
for the feature-phone platform (I got
a Bluetooth cursor remote for Win-
dows!). Strangely, I have yet to try a
Blackberry and an Android phone, but
they seem to be still weak on the multi-
media front so I’m not sure if I want to
take the risk on these alien platforms
just yet. Hopefully their performances
will have improved dramatically by the
beginning of summer.
Of course, the big question is will the
Palm Pre be better than the iPhone?
From what I have seen so far it is very
promising: not only does it have a mul-
ti-touch screen (only five announced
phones are known to have one), but it
can also multitask, has a camera with
built-in flash, and has a slide-down
QWERTY keyboard which some
might prefer to the virtual keyboard.
The Pre’s WebOS is nicely designed,
especially the calendar app which can
compress the free time to let you view
just the appointments, as well as the
Universal Search function which lets
you start searching (contacts, apps, in
Google, in Google Maps or in Wikipe-
dia) by just typing at the home screen,
and you can also pull up a shortcut bar
by dragging your finger from the bezel
to the screen. There is also a built-in
Amazon MP3 Store app, similar to
the iTunes app on the iPhone but the
tracks are cheaper. All sounds good so
far, but it will still depend on how well
it will do with video files.
What is certain is that I will defi-
nitely be replacing my iPhone once I
get my summer job money, and as you
can see I will be spoiled by the many
choices. Putting aside the different
types of platforms, I am simply looking
for a phone of good build quality (e.g.
by HTC) and has the many features
that I mentioned earlier plus a smooth
user experience. Sadly, I have yet to see
one device that has it all. Perhaps the
Pre will be my saviour? Or maybe a fu-
ture Android phone? Do send in your
thoughts via Twitter (@richardlai).

City of Technophilia
Richard Lai talks about his favourite kind of day in Hong Kong
E
very time I go back to Hong
Kong, the first thing I would
do usually involve pigging
out on the local snacks
(custard tarts, cheung fan,
fish balls, etc.) and visiting the gadget
shops. For the latter you are probably
imagining me wandering around a
quiet, badly managed computer store
(need I mention any names?). Thank-
fully, Hong Kong is nothing like that.
As a small city of some seven million
people, Hong Kong doesn’t do many
warehouse-type stores like we do in
the UK, but they do have a couple of
districts dedicated to consumer elec-
tronics. Ask any locals and they would
usually point you to Sham Shui Po for
computer products and second hand
mobile phones, and Mong Kok (feel
free to giggle, and there’s also a Shatin
while you’re at it) for a greater range
of gadgets such as cameras, MP3 play-
ers and TVs. Even a good travel guide
would mention these two attractions,
especially with Mong Kok holding the
world record for population density.
Of course, the fact that these two dis-
tricts can be turned into technophilic
hangouts can only mean one thing:
Hongkongers totally love their gadg-
ets, so much that what seems to be an
obsession in the foreign eye is just the
norm in this small metropolis. Geeks
like myself wouldn’t feel the least bit
of alienation when stood in the streets
full of other local technophiles.
What keeps this bizarre phenom-
enon ticking lies in the characteristics
of the two districts: Sham Shui Po and
Mong Kok house the latest technolo-
gies in the city, yet ironically they also
suffer from the worst urban decay in
Hong Kong. For instance, take a stroll
along Sham Shui Po’s Apliu Street on
a weekday afternoon, and you should
see many pensioners out of their sev-
enty-year-old buildings, discussing the
latest features on mobile phones while
swapping for a different phone at the
second hand shops (at a small charge,
of course). Cross the main road and
you would also see the occasional mid-
dle-aged men checking out the laptops
at the computer shopping centres.
On the other end of the age spec-
trum, a great part of Hong Kong
teenagers are known for their obses-
sion with video games. The modern
hip nickname for Hong Kong male
geeks is “train boy” (電車男), same as
the Japanese book title in which the
lead character has a great passion for
manga and computer games, yet he
is inexperienced in socialising with
women. Luckily, in recent years girls
in Hong Kong are also becoming more
tech-savvy, and some do visit elec-
tronic stores without the assistance of
a male companion - a big contrast to
the sausage fest ten years ago. There is
no doubt that we owe the Nintendo DS
and Wii for the improved gender ratio,
but in the computer market consumers
just generally seem to be more confi-
dent than ever, probably to do with the
increasing popularity with the Hong
Kong online forums where members
exchange tips on buying computers.
Despite the rapidly increasing user
base, Hong Kong’s actual gadget re-
tailing space has not extended much
beyond Sham Shui Po and Mong Kok
over the last ten years. For the former
only one of its landmark computer cen-
tres has had a recent small extension
since its grand opening three decades
ago, and the latter still relies on just Sai
Yong Choi Street and Mong Kok Com-
puter Centre as its gadget hub.
However, what has increased is the
size and number of computer expos
each year, upsetting the large number
of small shops. I went to the expo any-
way, only to be disappointed by the
lack of discounts and excitement. This
just shows that Hong Kong needs little
addition to its already fantastic gadget
haven.
As you can see, Hong Kong has a lot
to offer on both the old and the new,
so do visit before you run out of time!
Computer shopping centres are dotted across Sham Shui Po district.
Try-before-buy at a second-hand mobile phone stall. Gadgets are displayed in the style of a wet market.
