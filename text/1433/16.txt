Union reveals new
tasty dish with secret
ingredient
W
hile a Hangman in-
vestigation (which
involves reading
what real reporters
have uncovered,
see page 4) has ‘uncovered’ the truth
about Union food, which is that it’s
absolute bollocks, it’s not all doom and
gloom for Imperial students looking
for cheap but delicious cuisine.
The Union’s team of Michelin (me-
diocre) starred chefs have come up
with a new dish that is certain to grab
the hearts and stomachs (and possibly
bowels) of students. A meat variant of
the famous French dish Ratatouille,
‘Rat-au-Beit’ will be hitting the Union
menus from next week at the credit
crunch busting price of £1.95.
Afonso Campos, our very own Food
Editor, has had the privilege of a sneak
preview. He commented that “the
dish had as much flavour and texture
as most Union food” but said that the
meat was certainly very fresh.
Hangman’s investigative team (teat)
interviewed Union President Jenny
Morgan who refused to reveal the type
of meat used in the new dish, referring
us to her comments on the banana
story, see right.
We sent our Japanese Private Eye...
(you figure it out, we don’t want to get
sued) into the Union kitchens in an at-
tempt to discover the meat used in the
meal but he found nothing except a
lot of cheese, rat traps and every epi-
sode of Biker Mice from Mars on VHS.
With Hangman’s team of eggheads
(dickheads) unable to put two and two
together, it seems that the secret meat
will remain secret.
In the meantime, we’re just glad that
we can leave our cheese in the Quad
without fear.

n a daring daylight robbery, a
person (or persons) has stolen
Imperial’s entire supply of Fair-
trade bananas. The fate of the
bananas is as yet unknown but
a note demanding “¥80,000” was left
at the scene of the crime. It is believed
that neither the College nor the Union
plan to pay the ransom with Union
President Jenny Morgan commenting
“We don’t negotiate with criminals”.
The robbery occured last Saturday
at approximately 3:29:25pm. Initially
the College claimed that the thieves
had broken through 12 sealed titanium
vaults by guessing the pin numbers, fak-
ing the voice recognition and blinking
really quickly to pass the retina scan but
a Hangman investigative squad (squir-
rel) has uncovered a number of security
failures including, leaving the bananas
unguarded in the street (see picture be-
low). When shown this evidence, Union
President Jenny Morgan commented
“We don’t negotiate with squirrels”.
Imperial has said that it is using all
the power at its disposal to track down
the thieves and recover the bananas.
A private investigator (investigator of
privates) by the name Mr. Bananaman
reportedly approached Imperial, offer-
ing to find the bananas for the small fee
of ¥80,000 but Union President Jenny
Morgan responded “We don’t negoti-
ate with fictional characters”.
The debacle has had further rami-
fications. With students clamouring
for a low-cost fruit with a slow energy
release, Imperial has turned to non-
Fairtrade banana sources as a quick-fix
to the banana shortage. Imperial appar-
ently approached a number of banana
farmers from the deserts of North Af-
rica to the icy steppes of Mongolia be-
fore finally finding a Brazilian farmer,
Mr Rodriguez who promised to satisfy
Imperial’s banana needs. Despite Union
President Jenny Morgan’s protestations
of “We don’t negotiate with Brazilians”,
Imperial reputedly signed a contract of
3p per bunch with Mr Rodriguez.
It’s this price thats got the atten-
tion of the Fairtrade organisation who
pointed out that 3p per bunch did not
constitute a living wage, emphasising
“Yes, even for Brazilians”.
Hangman sent a team (one guy) of
reporters to Brazil (the bar) to hear the
farmer’s side of the story. When asked
why he agreed to the price, he said “Im-
perial have promised me an honorary
degree”. We examined the conditions
for his workers and found that he was
using Imperial biology students who
had been decieved into thinking they
were going on a fieldtrip. Their fami-
lies are now appealing to Union Presi-
dent Jenny Morgan to bring their chil-
dren home, but she commented “WE
DON’T NEGOTIATE BLAHAH!”
Hangman’s team
of eggheads did
come up with a few
suggestions:
• Inuit sirloin
• Maori rib-eye
• Bolshevik t-bone
• Oriental rump
• Red Indian fillet
• Ethiopian blue
• Dutch chops
How to play:
It’s quite simple, all numbers are in a
cell and must be surrounded with a
corresponding number lines. Lines
cannot split and there can only be
one continuous line. Any cells with no
numbers can have any number of lines.
Look at the solution above for help.

Going Underground
A complete turnaround from last week,
with Team Shotgun not having a single

taking a commanding lead at the top of
the FUCWIT Table. Last week’s answer
was Sudbury Town by the way!

So which London tube station sums to 164?
This week’s Cat Phone:
_ _ _ _ _
Each letter in the alphabet is assigned a
value, 1-26 (see table) and when added
together for a specific word the sum
equals the total shown. All you have to
do is scan and send the Underground
station that is hidden each week to su-
doku.felix@imperial.ac.uk
Wordoku is identical to Sudoku;
we’ve just replaced numbers
with letters. Complete the puzzle
and then send the whole grid to
sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
You will not get credit for just the
word alone. It’s not an anagram.
Mentalist Maze...
Oh so now you do want the points,
well tough, you can’t have them. You
guessed it (probably not), Nicholas
Jones was the first and only person to
get this answer in. This guy is mental,
I mean look at the grid, it is sooooo
bloody difficult. In fact, double points
to anyone who get it right! Done.

Nonogram 1,433
How to play:
Nonograms are logic puzzles in which cells
in a grid have to be coloured or left blank ac-
cording to numbers at the side of the grid.
The numbers measure how many unbroken
lines or filled-in squares there are in any given
row or column. Look at the solution for help.
MÖchten sie mein Manschaft win yet again.
