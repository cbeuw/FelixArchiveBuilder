Ed Banger take you
to musical Heaven
Another nondescript Bank Holiday
Sunday. The day was drawing to a
close, pre-drinks had been drunk and
I made my way to Heaven. That’s right,
Vice Magazine were having a party.
And it was good.
Hipsters and people wearing those
geek-chic granny glasses danced until
dawn, with big eyes and cans of Red
Stripe. The line-up was great. In the
main room we had Busy P, DJ Mehdi
and Feadz making up the legendary
Ed Banger Records Trio – lucky lucky!
This invincible cross-genre Paris label
is the home of Justice and Sebastian
and these guys have been redefining
Fan Death, Filthy Dukes, Busy P
,
Feadz, and DJ Mehdi

The Art of the
Remix
I
was talking to someone the oth-
er day who mentioned that they
“really like that La Roux song,
how does it go, going in for the
kill...?” and I had to ask them if
they meant the original or the Skream
remix, or the Foamo remix, or a differ-
ent mix, and it occured to me that if
there is one defining thing about music
at the moment, one thing that people
might look back on as the music of
the “noughties” (I hate that word) it is
remixes.
Remixes of everything have sprung
up as part of the internet’s music
blog culture, and have continuously
brought fresh takes on new songs for
our short attention spans to enjoy.
Remixes have lead to merging of dif-
ferent genres and exciting new things
have sprung up from them such as UK
funky house, a merging of funky house
and grime, bashment, a merging of UK
funky house and Jamaican dancehall,
and no doubt others I am unaware of.
So heres a rough guide to some of
the main artisans of the remix, the DJs,
artists and producers who have turned
their hands to turning round songs
and have gained appriciation across
the music “blogosphere” (I hate that
word too).
French producer Fred Falke has
remixed almost every mp3 someone
has ever posted online, including a re-
cent remix of Grizzly Bear’s track “two
weeks” which is 7 minutes 45 seconds
of pure disco electro happiness. He’s
even remixed a U2 song, and when you
get to the point where you have to look
to U2 for songs, you have to wonder if
you have taken his remix addiction one
step too far.
Diplo is a veteran of the mix, hav-
ing remixed over thirty songs since he
started back in 2005 and has remixed
artists from The Beatles to Three 6
Mafia. I reccomment his mix of the
Major Lazer song “hold the line”.
By contrast, Classixx (the Xs are for
your googling ease) are relatively new
to the game, but have made my favour-
ite remix of the day: Phoenix’s “liszto-
mania” as well as a bunch of others.
They haven’t even put out any of their
own records yet, though I’ve read we
can expect their EP next year.
London’s most ubiquitous electro DJ,
Erol Alkan is no stranger to remix-
ing either. Though he hasn’t done as
much as Diplo, he has used his signa-
ture remixing to popularize tracks like
Dance Area’s “AA247”.
Taking a step back from such abra-
sive club electro, artists like the DJ duo
Aeroplane are pretty much known
exclusively for their melodic laid back
disco remixes such as their sublime
take on the already much-remixed
“Paris” by Friendly Fires.
For something a bit more intellec-
tual, have a listen to some of the many
remixes by Swedish ambient artist Jo-
han Agebjörn, such as Glass Candy’s
“the Chameleon”. I’ve mentioned only
a tiny electro-centric handful of the
many, many remixes out there, so get
online and find some for yourself.

@ Kentish Town Forum

Although the last time Papa Roach
played in the UK was the better part
of ten years ago, some things haven’t
changed much. The place was packed
to the rafters with black-outfitted teen-
age boys wearing too much eye-liner,
although the scene was ruined some-
what by the collection of bemused
middle-aged mums who’d brought
them, drinking G&T and discussing
Eastenders at the back.
A few things have changed since we
last saw the band, though. Nu-metal
is, it seems, finally dead, although its
replacement seems to owe more to
Bon Jovi than anything more recent
and disappointingly the band’s sound
has gone down the same route as that
of Linkin Park and the Lostproph-
ets. Some of the band’s recent mate-
rial (from their new album Metamor-
phosis) seemed a bit rockier, but the
majority of the gig was more power
ballad than the ‘proper’ rock that the
Stone Gods or the Answer produce so
reliably.
Still, the live show was fun – front-
man Jacoby Shaddix fancies himself as
a kind of emo Freddy Mercury, pos-
ing and working the adoring crowd,
who responded with the first half-way
decent mosh pits I’ve seen in months.
The new drummer, Tony Palermo (ex
of Unwritten Law), was also a minor
revelation, finding some drive and ag-
gression in some otherwise fairly bland
songs. The guitarists weren’t taxed too
much – one thing that has carried over
from the old nu-metal albums is the
staccato, minimalist riff style, although
this did mean that the axe-men had
plenty of time to pull rock poses and
point into the crowd, Spinal Tap style.
Sure, it was all a bit panto, but there’s
space in rock and roll for that, surely.
As always, it was worth not paying
too much attention to the lyrics – let’s
be honest, most of the songs are a bit
paint-by-numbers, and the recent sin-
gle Hollywood Whore is no real excep-
tion, an irony-free song by a Jack-Dan-
iels-and-cocaine pop-rock band about
how shallow people are on the L.A.
party circuit.
The band are a lot better live than
on CD, though, and it’s worth trying to
catch them at Download if you’re go-
ing to spend any time rocking out post-
exams this summer.

The foxes are truly out the bag
I would be most surprised if over the
last six months that every individual
with the slightest appreciation of their
surroundings had not somehow been
made aware of the existence of a band
by the name of the Fleet Foxes, be it
overtly, through large posters on the
tube emphatically stating ‘album of the
year’ with the rather surreal medieval
artwork or via more discreet sublimi-
nal messaging emerging from my des-
perate attempts to preach the gospel
regarding this blissful band.
Either way, if you have yet to have
been made aware of the Fleet Foxes
I hope in the ensuing paragraphs my
childlike enthusiasm will convey some
description.
First surfacing to a wider audience
amidst uncontrollable excitement in
the aftermath of the 2008 SXSW festi-
val it seems that this Seattle based folk-
rock collective have slowly emerged
from relative unknowns to being wild-
ly acknowledged as the torch bearers
for ambient music that echoes a purer
form of yesteryear (with influences of
Neil Young, The Beach Boys and Har-
ry Nilson) whilst containing a power-
ful medieval element.
This evening, the Fleet Foxes are
rounding of 3 sold-out nights at the
Roundhouse as a final swansong to an
incredibly successful past 18 months.
Opening with the first song of their
second EP - ‘Sun Giant’, front man
Robin Pecknold officially ends the
dark and dismal days of winter with
a stunning vocal harmony with vivid
references, ‘What a life I lead in the
sun, what a life I lead in the spring’,
creating inviting images of the wind,
sea and sun.
The first 60 seconds are wonder-
ful as Pecknold along with bassist
Christian Bargo, Casey Westcott on
the keyboard and drummer Josh Till-
man create a heavenly vocal harmony
that captivates the audience from the
onset.
The transition to ‘Drops in the Riv-
er’ is seamless as my personal favour-
ite song is delivered with a delicacy
that touches on perfection. A subtle
chord progression begins this track
as Pecknold continues with his serene
imagery, ‘On the shore, speak to the
ocean and receive silence,’ the song
slowly builds and builds to a climax as
the wild imagery meets what appears
to be bitter memories. I don’t know
whether to laugh or cry. The melody
is heavenly, the notion of being alone
surrounding by all things organic pure
is so appealing but the underlying re-
lease of a passed love is rather hard to
stomach. Maybe I am just a wet blan-
ket but this for me is what makes this
band so interesting, the music is so
pure but there is this underlying sin-
ister element that consistently lurks in
Pecknold’s lyrics.
The 2,000 packed into the round-
house are then treated to some of the
most infectious and peaceful songs
as ‘English Summer House’, ‘White
Winter Hymnal’ and ‘Ragged Wood’
are delivered with faultless melody.
The backing vocals are so tight and
allow Pecknold to verge into emotive
cries that make for some captivating
moments. It is very refreshing that
whilst the band produces evocative in-
strumentals, the vocal harmonies are
given prominence with the opening of
‘Ragged Wood’ being an excellent ex-
ample of this wonderful human sound.
Following from the delightful melo-
dy of the previous songs the set is laid
bare as Pecknold is left alone on stage
and given the space of the Round-
house to demonstrate his harmonic
voice that contains deep depths of
soul. ‘Oliver James’ brings all members
of the audience into a collective awe as
the narrative of young Mr. James being
brought home from the rain is giving
a haunting resonance by Pecknold’s
voice. This song again shows the in-
triguing contrast between enchanting
sound and more lurid sentiment, ‘The
sound of ancient voices ringing soft
upon your ear’ as death is again fused
with nature in an elegant fashion.
The rest of the band returns to de-
liver the remainder of the first part
of the set and execute fan favourite
‘Mykonos’ to rapturous applause. This
epic song of redemption and friend-
ship with yet more powerful imagery,
‘and you will go to Mykonos with a
vision of a gentle coast and a sun to
maybe dissipate shadows of the mess
you made’.
Pecknold is again given the undi-
vided attention of the Roundhouse
as he returns unaccompanied by the
remainder of the band for the encore.
He is also astoundingly unaccompa-
nied by a microphone and amps as he
steps right to edge of stage for a cover
of a traditional American folk song by
the name of ‘Katie Cruel’. The audi-
ence is deathly silent as this powerful
tale of a prostitute from the 1700s as
nothing but Pecknold’s voice echoes in
the compact dome of the Roundhouse.
This is followed by Tiger Mountain
Peasant Song before whole band join
How folky is this guy? Jesus beard, acoustic guitar, brown grandad cardie, plaid shirt...
in unison for the delightful closer Blue
Ridge Mountains.
The sound throughout the whole
gig is excellent and the venue provides
quite possibly the optimum space, size
and all important acoustics for these
wondrous musicians.
Despite this, Pecknold does express
a proposal to use the distinctive shape
of the Roundhouse for a planetarium.
I for one can see merit in such a sug-
gestion but only providing they come
back soon, not only for a little bit of
star gazing action but some awe-in-
spiring performances of tranquil, in-
triguing and beautiful music.

A thousand lucky people managed
to beg, borrow and steal tickets to
tonights sold out show at the Scala
in Kings Cross. It was a rare in-
timate occasion to see a band of
such monumental proportions.
I think it was fair to say, the
start of tonights set caught most
people completely off guard.
The drone of ‘She is not Alone,’
a song from the bands infancy,
was a curious choice to begin
with, on account of its slow
rhythmic pace and monot-
onic melody. It was ap-
preciated nonetheless,
but the room really
started to ignite when
the pounding drums
erupt underneath the
opening harmonics to
‘bull in the heather’.

the sound of our dance floors.
“I don’t think there’s a noise com-
petition,” laughs Busy P, a.k.a. Pedro
Winter, the founder of Ed Banger
Records and Daft Punk’s manager.
“But, definitely, it’s something we play
with. We’re making distortion musical.
We’re making noise funky.”
Dance music suffered corporate
strangulation in the Nineties and it’s
labels like Ed Banger which have in-
spired a nouveau cavalier underground
club culture. Their Gallic beats were
the main attraction of the night and
they definitely didn’t disappoint.
So Busy P is basically the Godfather
of French electro [Ed note: Daft Punk?]
and DJ Mehdi’s rap music background
has turned him into one of the French
underground hip hop scene’s premier
producers. Feadz is Fabien Pianta. He’s
another child of hip hop and is a tal-
ented, exciting DJ known for especially
for his collaborations with Uffie.
We also had some great live sets
from the decadent dancepop of Filthy
Dukes (“electroacidhousenuravetwist-
eddiscopunkfunk”, according to Poly-
dor) and electrodisco duo Fan Death.
These two girls had sequins and stage
presence in bucket loads. Check out
Veronica’s Veil on YouTube for a taste
of their take on Eighties fantasy synth-
pop. They say they make music recall-
ing the greatest era of electronic pop;
think Depeche Mode, New Order, Hu-
man League, Soft Cell. . .
The niggle of the night was the extor-
tionate ‘cigarette wristband’; if you got
the jitters for a ciggy or some sweat-
free air, you had to pay a quid to go out
and get back in again. And £4.40 for a
can of beer was pretty steep.
Aside from that, my night in Heaven
was heavenly. “French electro, upfront
tech house, fidgety business spliced
with hip hop and rudeness”. You just
can’t go wrong with that. I’m making
it a habit that I stay out really ridicu-
lously late every Bank Holiday.
Sonic Youth blast out the tunes at Scala
band’s name has been well pointed out
before, with Kim Gordon for one being
56 years ‘young’ but any petty ridicule
was soon rendered obsolete. This is a
group of people who are still effort-
lessly cool, and unrelenting in their
passion to perform. It’s fantastic to see,
Lee Ranaldo’s silver barnet aside, the
band looking like I would have imag-
ined them in 1989. ‘The Sprawl’ and
‘Cross the Breeze’ from the epic ‘Day-
dream Nation,’ are delivered with such
ferocity that unlike so many bands who
resist hiatus, you don’t wish you could
buy that time machine to go back
twenty years.
2009 sees the release of yet another
album ‘The Eternal’ and the new songs
played tonight fitted in well, it certain-
ly doesn’t feel like they’ve got any in-
tention of resting on their laurels soon.
The new seemed a logical progres-
sion from the much acclaimed ‘Rather
Ripped’ of three years previous, main-
taining a feel of strong melodic impor-
tance overlaid with the trademark SY
frantic mess of noise, although never
felt to be simply covering old ground.
Two encores followed. Ending with
the defiant ‘Kool Thing’ was sublime,
although my personal favourite of the
set was ‘Schizophrenia’. The girl really doesn’t look comfortable stuck between those guys
