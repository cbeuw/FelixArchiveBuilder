This week you listen
to Lady Gaga’s ‘Poker
Face’ and your
natural dislike for
the bint makes your
mind interpret the
name of the song differently. You decide to go
to her hotel room and repeatedly poke her face
with a red hot poker until she has bliters and
boils all over. To finish the whole ensemble off,
you let a dog piss on her face. Job done!

Virgo
Oh, so you’ve found
a sugar daddy, have
you? Have you ever
thought he might by
lying to you? Have
you ever taken a bus
with him? No? He’s too scared to show you
his Freedom Pass. All that stuff he’s buying
you? Well, that’s just his next 10 year’s private
pension money taken out in advance. He’s not
old but rich. He’s just old. Normal old. Fail.
Gemini
Why does the library
close on Friday night?
You sneak in, to go
find out and uncover
the infomation that a
paedophile ring use
it for their weekend ‘fun’ which is coincidently
where Madeline McCann is. Yay, you found
Maddy well done. You do however get raped
and die in hospital of a severe case of internal
bleeding. Fail.
Pisces
So the exam revision
is really getting to
you. You wonder
why you are sitting
in the librabry next
to smelly German
at one in the morning and consider giving up.
Not only do I encourage you to give up, but I
feel that it would be oh so rude if you didn’t
also throw yourself into the Thames and get
washed out to sea.
Leo
So now you have
clowns to left of you
and jokers to the
right. No it’s not some
Stealers Wheel music
video, it’s the bloody
Union and to top it off, karaokee kicks off in
daVinci’s which is directly behind you. Without
fail, you get some Whitney Houston diva on the
microphone trying her very best to sing one of
her greatest hits but sounds as tuneful as a frog.
Aries
Guess what! Hot out
of the oven a new
batch of American
poon. If any one of
them even thinks of
saying “I like your
English” accent or “OMFG” or for fuck’s sake
“LOLS”, then I swear I will rip out their vocal
cords. Next I will put them in a burger and send
it back to their mother explaining what cunts
they are. LMAO.
Scorpio
Enough of this shit
music combination
from the Union, time
for action. You ram
the shisha down the
Mariachi’s throat, tell
the diva to blow the thing out of the Mariachi’s ass
and then burn the retina’s of the DJ as he may as
well be blind as well as deaf and totally shit at his
job. To finish it off, you wrap the guitar cords arond
the neck of the diva and start knocking out some
Springsteen. Unfortunately in the process you gash
open the Diva’s neck open and she bled all over the
floor. Wow, that whole thing really got out of hand!
Libra
This week you realise
(although I don’t know
why it took so long)
that the President-
elect has no fucking
sense of humour. It
could probably be because jokes have changed
since Jack the Ripper, although even he would
get these jokes. Some guy in the office left his
facebook open, we destroyed it, it was funny. It’s
a fucking funny story you waxed head dick!!
Taurus
After only just get-
ting over the fact that
you’ve got a thalido-
mide Beethoven try-
ing to mix the decks,
you then realise you
have a couple of gay Mariachi guitar playing
twats sitting behind you. These Enrique Iglesias
wannabes are even trying to have a camp fire
sing-along around a perfectly lit shisha and are
doing absolutely nothin with it.

This week you meet
a girl called Mandy.
She is more beautiful
than... well a beautiful
thing. Yesterday was
a dream, you face the
morning, crying on a breeze, the pain is gone.
Oh Mandy. When you kiss her it stops you from
shaking, but you’ll send her away, oh Mandy.
Mandy was 65 and a prostitute who worked the
streets to fund her drug habit. Pint?

This week you sit in
Beit Quad for some
quiet drinks with

some tunes but failing miserably. How fucking

control panel. Bafoon!

H
ello dear readers. I am
writing about my past
week to tell you how I
have been raped. Not
physically, That would
be awful and not something I would
share. Somewhat a personal matter if
that had happened. Well on to the not
so horric storey.
My first “rape” as it were was in last
weeks edition of felix. The puzzles
editor, or general or whatever it is, de-
cided to edit my lovely storey about
my shopping expedition to westfileds
shopping center. Kindly saying that
my better half was the one who bought
my new clothes and insinuating that
I’m kept. This was further propagated
by the horoscope where I have been
told that I have Changed. Truth is I
have changed, I hve had a hair cut and
bough some new clothes. What i don;t
understand is why there is a need to
state this. I am still the same person, I
still talk the same, walk the same, and
do the same things. In essence I have
only changed in apperence. And so
what. If Charles Murdoch is waiting for
me to break and get pissed off, he may
have to wait a while. i don’t particularly
care, and I am not writing this storey to
in retalliation to anything. I am writing
it because sadly it’s the most interst-
ing thing that has happened in the last
week. I believe it has something to do
with exams crushing my available time
to go and be a complete idiot. Ah well,
time for the second Raping.
The second time was the classic face-
book rape. I foolishly left myself logged
into facebook one night while in the
felix office, to which all the editors re-
maining in the office decided to molest
my facebook profile towards a gay ori-
entation. I laugh though as the status
update was:
“WANTED: middle-aged male, ea-
ger for wild sex, preferable fetish more
S&M and bondage gear, must be non-
allergic to latex and have strong arse
muscle grip for my miniature penis.
Price negotiable. “
This was quite funny, however the
random homosexual friends I had
newly acquired left me some disturb-
ing messages. Such as :
“hey sweets. soon some time? what
about you? where can we go? x “
As well as old friends relishing in
my misfortune. I thought this would
amuse you guys in a time of “hard”
revision. Until next time dear readers,
until next time.

something to do in their spare time!
