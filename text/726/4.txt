I find it hard to
u n d e r s t a n d why R S M U has
to place s u c h i m p o r t a n c e
o n this event w h i c h has
been so harmful to our
C o l l e g e and our reputation
as students here, a n d
s h o w s any attempt to

I also w o n d e r w h y M r
P e a r c e w a n t s to flaunt
before the C o l l e g e the fact
that they've held H o n P o r n
night without a n y o n e

the thrill of d o i n g
s o m e t h i n g s o c i a l l y taboo,
as he m e n t i o n s in his

that a p p r o a c h is m o r e
reminescent of s c h o o l
c h i l d r e n having a secret
s m o k e b e h i n d the bike
sheds, than a mature
attitude to r u n n i n g a
students' u n i o n . I h o p e that
Mr P e a r c e will c o n t i n u e to
be o p e n m i n d e d in the
future so that w e c a n have

Ashamed of IC
D e a r Sir,
I f o u n d David P e a r c e ' s
article o n H o n P o r n night
( F E L I X 725) very
p a t r o n i s i n g a n d , I think,
deliberately naive. M r
P e a r c e infers that
m a n u f a c t u r e of bras and
H o n P o r n night are 'sexist'
in the s a m e way, w h i c h
leads me to believe that he
totally m i s u n d e r s t a n d s the
issues. M a n u f a c t u r e of bras
is not d e g r a d i n g to m e n .
T h e event, by its very
nature, s u b j u g a t e s w o m e n ,
and s o to s u g g e s t that to
w a t c h w o m e n as objects,
m u c h like a n i m a l s in a z o o ,
is consistent with treating
w o m e n as equal human
beings is d o u b l e think of
the greatest proportions.
H o w e v e r , most offensive
of all, I thought, is the w a y
that M r P e a r c e raises the
'moral' q u e s t i o n ,
s u g g e s t i n g , by implications,
that p e o p l e o p p o s e d to
Hon P o r n night are s o m e
sort of self-righteous
purists, w h o are against
this 'natural act'. Indeed if
Mr P e a r c e thinks that H o n
P o r n night has any
c o n n e c t i o n with a natural
act then I w o n d e r at what
stage he d r o p p e d B i o l o g y
at s c h o o l ?
A s a male student at IC I
am a s h a m e d to be
a s s o c i a t e d with p e o p l e w h o
exploit s u c h false
r e a s o n i n g to s u p p o r t their
actions.
Yours faithfully
