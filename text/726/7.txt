Electrochemical sensors
look set to revolutionize
many aspects of industry,
medicine, and agriculture.
The sensors now being
developed have the ability
to detect a specific
chemical s p e c i e s in a
mixture, and to measure its
concentrations in real time
and real s p a c e and will give
many different scientists a
more precise insight into
the systems they work with.
Here at Imperial C o l l e g e a
great deal of research is
being directed to the
development of new
electrochemical sensors. In
the Chemistry Department,
Professor J o h n Albery's
group are working on a
number of new sensors that
are designed to meet
specific needs in medicine,
agriculture, industry and
even the police force. While
in the B i o t e c h n o l o g y

biosensors, w h i c h make

Electrochemical sensors
are so valuable because
they provide the most

concentration of a species
into an electrical signal.
Their action is really made
of two parts: the selective
recognition of the species,
and the production of a
signal related to that
concentration.
Specific recognition is by
no means easy to achieve,
and various methods can
be used depending on the
target s'pecies. T h e most
widespread technique
involves selective binding
of the species. However,
this requires a g o o d

target species and receptor.
While this can be achieved
for s o m e ions, when more
c o m p l e x shapes of target
molecule are involved, then
there are significant
difficulties with design and
production of receptor
structures of the right type.
However, by making use of
naturally occurring specific
recognition, in particular
enzymes, scientists have
been able to develop highly
selective new sensors.
These sensors, formed
from the coupling of
natural molecular
recognition with artificial
transduction, are called
biosensors and are proving
particularly potent when
applied to biotechnological
processes, clinical
m e d i c i n e and agriculture.
A n important aspect of
the use of electrochemical
sensors is that they allow
detection of a s p e c i e s
without the need for
separation, so making
continuous monitoring
possible. Clinically the fact
that they can be used for
rapid in vivo analysis is a
major step forward. They
are also robust, easy for
untrained staff to use, and
an e c o n o m i c a l l y viable
alternative to existing
analytical methods, w h i c h
often involve lengthy
laboratory analysis.

technique w h i c h is being
increasingly used to grow a
wide variety of crops. For
example, glass house crops
s u c h as tomatoes and
lettuce can be grown using
the nutrient film technique.
By making use of
electrochemical sensors,
Professor J o h n Albery and
Dr Barry Haggett have
been able to develop an
automatic nutrient film
analyser.
With the nutrient film
technique the soil is
