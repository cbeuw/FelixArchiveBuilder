Electric Cell
After 20 years of
c a m p a i g n i n g the Elec E n g
department is to get a
c o m m o n room. Students
agreed to give up s o m e
locker s p a c e so that the
ground floor locker room
could be carpeted and
furnished. N o date has
been fixed yet for an
official opening but this is
expected to o c c u r after the
installation of a coffee
machine, in early February.
G u i l d s President R o g e r
Preece, himself an
electrical engineer, said
that, until now, there has
been no real meeting point
for students in the
department, apart from '3
chairs in the foyer'. H e a d of
Elec E n g Professor M a y n e
said the room was a
'welcome addition'.
Mr Preece hopes this will
be an incentive to other
departments to provide a
meeting place for students
Important
Engagement
U n i o n Receptionist Kathy
Tait and R a g C h a i r m a n
J o h n Ingham were e n g a g e d
whilst spending a month's
holiday in the B a h a m a s .
T h e y have no immediate
plans, but expect to marry
when J o h n , at present in
the third year of his
C h e m i c a l Engineering
course, gains his degree.
Going
Underground
P r o p o s a l s have been put
forward by C o l l e g e to move
the F E L I X Office from its
present position, at the
entrance to Beit Q u a d , to
the kitchen area behind the
U n i o n L o u n g e . T h e extra
s p a c e generated will, if the
proposals are implemented,
be used for offices and
seminar r o o m s by t h e
College. F E L I X Editor H u g h
S o u t h e y and U n i o n
President Carl B u r g e s s will
be d i s c u s s i n g the proposals
with C o l l e g e Secretary
J o h n Smith today.
Data Bank
M i d l a n d Bank will be
donating computers to the
C o m p u t i n g Department for
use by undergraduates. It
has been reported that the
bank feels that the
government is
underinvesting e n o u g h in
universities.

J u d g i n g by the number of
entries we've had I'm sure
you're all just dying to
know the soultion to
'Electric Nightmare'.
Admittedly it was a difficult
problem, but I was
disappointed that n o b o d y
even attempted a solution.
O h well, we saved
ourselves five p o u n d s
anyway! T h e full solution is
given below.
Doors And Devils
Most people know the o l d
problem where you're
trying to escape from Hell,
you c o m e to two doors,
you know that o n e leads to
freedom, and that one
leads to a fiery pit. Outside
the doors are two devils,
o n e w h o always lies and
one who always tells the
truth, but you don't know
which is which. B y asking
one question only to one of
the devils, you have to find
the correct door to g o
through. T h e correct
question to ask of either
devil is: 'If I asked the other
devil which was the correct
door to g o through, what
would he say?' N o matter
w h i c h devil you ask, it will
indicate the w r o n g door.
Think about it!
N o w c o n s i d e r a slightly
harder problem. Firstly
there is only one devil w h o
not only might be a truth
teller or liar, but may
sometimes lie and
sometimes tell the truth.
S e c o n d l y there are more
than 2 doors, 4 say, and
only one leads to escape...
Y o u may only ask one
question and the devil can
indicate one door only.
A l s o the whole question
must apply to the devil (ie
you cannot ask questions
of the type 'If you are a liar
answer this way, but if you
are a truth teller answer
this way.').
What is the question?
T h e best entry submitted
by 1:00pm T u e s d a y 28th
will receive a £5 prize.
a distribution of current
that is just the addition of
the two previous current
distributions. (The two
solutions are 'superposed').
We've now essentially
solved the problem.
C o n s i d e r applying a
voltage of +1V at any point
on the grid. B e c a u s e the
grid is exactly symmetric
any current that flows must
have the s a m e value in all 4
directions (there can be n o
prefered direction) Call this
current I.

T h e voltage difference is 2V
and thus the effective
resistance is >2 ohm, and
that's the answer.
i n
Electric nightmare-Solution
T h e prpblem, if you
remember, was to find the
effective resistance across
o n e resistor of an infinite,
square, grid of o n e - o h m
resistors. T h e key to the
problem is that O h m ' s law,
V=IR, is linear (ie V is
proportional to I). T h u s if V A
=UR, and V b = l b R then (V*
+Vb)=(U+lh)R, obvious,
hey? A n y two solutions can
be added together to form
a third solution (this is
known as 'linear
superposition' in the
technical lingo, and can be
appliad to any linear
equation). This means that
for a fixed resistor
network, if applying a
certain voltage produces a
distribution of currents, a n d
applying a different voltage
at a different place
produces a s e c o n d
distribution of currents,
then applying both voltages
at the s a m e time produces
N o w take the adjacent
point and consider exactly
the opposite situation ie
apply — 1 V and a current of
-I will flow.
i r i
T h e s e are the two
solutions that w e
'superpose' together. W h e n
we d o this w e get t h e
solution for a 2V voltage
difference applied across
the one resistor.

4-
T h e currents in the
resistor add to give 21.
L o o k i n g at the resistor
alone w e have 2V across a
o n e - o h m resisitor which
implies 1=1 A. N o w looking
at the whole grid, the total
current flowing into and
out of the grid is 4I=4A.
Revolution
Last week we asked you to
see how many words you
c o u l d form from the letters
of the word 'Revolution'.
W e used as our definition
of a valid word anything
that appears in the Shorter
O x f o r d English Dictionary.
This p r o d u c e d a plethora o !
strange w o r d s w h i c h w e
have never heard of but,
sure e n o u g h , were in the
dictionary. W e also had
several people w h o had
used computer dictionaries
to find their words. W e are
glad to say that none of
these entries w o n or even
counted in the top few!
The entrant with the most
w o r d s claimed to have
found 314. W e had to
disqualify s o m e o ' these as
they were not words but
letters, prefixes, suffixes or
abbreviations (eg. e, v, IOU,
oo, eo).
Of the 250 we c h e c k e d ,
s o m e were very weird.
E x a m p l e s include: vlei —
South. African word for a
hollow in w h i c h rain
collects; levin — (flash of)
lightening; heroli —
essential oil from flowers of
bitter orange used in
perfumery.
