Imperial Animals]
Sir,
I write regarding the
opinion c o l u m n on H o n
Porn night. While I am
relieved by D a v e Pearce's
assurance that he does not
maltreat w o m e n , I do not
think his arguments stand
up in any context wider
than the R S M U n i o n office,
for the following reasons:—
Firstly, if the a u d i e n c e
merely enjoy the thrill of
'watching something
socially taboo', w h y does
that something always have
to be p o r n o g r a p h y ? There
are many other social
taboos, as I am sure
members of R S M can
testify.
Secondly, although I
agree that sex is natural, I
do feel that sex between a
pig and a (human) w o m a n
must be an exception to
the rule. This, I am assured
is part of the
'entertainment' available.
Thirdly L o n d o n caters
adequately for people
wishing to watch strippers
and pornography, so there
is no need for H o n P o r n
night to be held even o n c e
a year at Imperial C o l l e g e .
T o s u m up my objections
to H o n Porn night, not only
is it degrading to both
performers and audience,
but it is also uneo*6sary.
A s a man at Imperial
College, I don't want to be
branded an animal, an
imbecile or a sexist, so
although I can appreciate
R S M ' s desire to be
a u t o n o m o u s , they s h o u l d
also realise the
responsibilities they have
as part of Imperial C o l l e g e ,
and Imperial C o l l e g e
U n i o n . Responsibilities
w h i c h cannot be lifted
merely by mobilising the
n o w - i n f a m o u s R S M B l o c k -
vote.
Yours

Morally Degrading
Dear Sir,
The shallow and often n o n -
sensical c o m m e n t a r y from
Dave Pearce of R S M U
'justifying' the R S M U
'Rugby' C l u b ' s H o n P o r n
Night is a fair indictment of
the event in itself. M a y we
try to offer what w e believe
to be reasonable and
intelligent argument against
s u c h events.
Firstly tradition is no
justification for continuing
to behave in a particular
way. It is undoubtedly true
that pornographic events,
whilst in themselves
bringing excitement and
'thrills' to certain sections
of the population, are
morally degrading.
Mr Pearce's contention
that the audience do not
watch pornographic events
for sexual pleasure is, quite
frankly, naive. We find it
surprising that, as an
intelligent person (with A
levels as well), he regards it
simply as s o m e high-
spirited boyish
naughtiness. His remarks
on s e x i s m , particularly
about the lingerie industry
in this country, s h o w a
degree of
misunderstanding and
insensitivity that is
disturbing.
'Do the audience c o m e
away feeling that w o m e n
are for sex only?', he asks
himself. T h e content and
direction of pornographic
films clearly present this to
be a primary, if not sole
role of w o m e n in society.
This can be the only view
be it c o n s c i o u s or
s u b c o n s i o u s , one leaves
with after watching s u c h a
film, and one, in our view,
w h i c h is as degrading to
men as it is to w o m e n .
T o present what was
ntended by G o d (as Mr
Pearce tentatively argues
and that we w o u l d
maintain) to be a natural
act between a man and
w o m a n in a c o m m i t e d
relationship (ie Marriage),
as a public performance
and further, the portrayal of
unatural sex acts (whether
'just acted' or real) is a
betrayal of our self-respect
and perversion of human
dignity.
It is sad that relatively
intelligent and sensible
people should find their
excitement and thrills in
sexual fantasies or in
getting paralytically drunk,
or whatever, reflecting,
surely, their low level of
expectancy of a fulfilled
and productive life. A s
Christians we believe that
J e s u s Christ c a m e to offer
the world life—a life of
ful«ess and purpose, J e s u s
said, 'I have c o m e that they
may have life, and have it
to the full' (John 10 v11);
and he laid down his own
life that we might enjoy this
life now.

Coach Savings
Dear Editor,
I w o u l d like to bring to the
attention of club and
society officials, w h o are
responsible for c o a c h
bookings, that Capital
C o a c h e s Limited hire
charges for trips to
destinations outside
L o n d o n are comparatively
expensive.
Officials can easily save
not only IC U n i o n , but also
their members, a significant
s u m of money by hiring
from another c o m p a n y .
Yours faithfully

Porn not
a'Preece'iated
Dear Sir,
Last week we had an
explanation and
justification of the Royal
S c h o o l of M i n e s H o n Porn
night from the President
himself.
Mr Pearce believes that
H o n P o r n is sexist, but only
because it appeals mainly
to men, in the s a m e way
that wearing bras appeals
to w o m e n . This is
ridiculous, H o n Porns is
sexist b e c a u s e it degrades
and humiliates men and
w o m e n portraying them as
objects to be used and
abused. Not so, says R S M ,
