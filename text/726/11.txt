Photosoc Competition
M a y b e it's because there
wasn't e n o u g h publicity
that the response to our
magnificent photosoc
F E L I X Competition was so
bad. Don't laugh, but we
only got three entries.
Pathetic isn't It? But not to
worry! If you are an
undiscovered photographic
genius (and I know there
are hundreds of y o u out
there) then all is not lost,
because we are going to
have A N O T H E R
C O M P E T I T I O N , this time
with a small P R I Z E . All you
need to do is submit a
portfolio of up to four black
and white or colour prints
(not slides) to the F E L I X
office before the end of
term. T h e pictures can be
of any subject whatsoever
and any size.
Meanwhile here are the
results of our very small
Christmas competition.
First: Ping C h u a n g , second:
H u g h Rubin and third:
Julian S h u l m a n . Mr
S h u l m a n submitted a very
interesting portfolio
consisting of s o m e views of
a suburban housing estate,
a rainbow, a cat walking on
a garden fence and a small
d o g in an armchair. H u g h
Rubin's portfolio was
extremely g o o d . It
consisted of a series of
B & W prints of superb
quality and excellently
c o m p o s e d . Four of these
were particularly
impressive. It is unfortunate
that you cannot see them,
because they really are
very g o o d . It seems to be
the (almost) u n a n i m o u s
opinion of the FELIX staff,
however that Ping
C h u a n g ' s portfolio was the
best, although personally I
prefer Mr Rubin's pictures.
T h e photograph
reproduced here is actually
about 12 inches by 16
inches and mounted in
glass. It is a m o n o c h r o m e
print which has been hand
coloured, and it must be
said that the F E L I X printing
does not do full justice to
it. S o if you are wondering
why this particular picture
was c h o s e n , you must bear
in mind that it looks m u c h
more impressive in real life.
Well, that's all folks!
R e m e m b e r that we want
lots and lots and lots of
entries for the new
competition, so get your
shutter fingers working
over-time and let's see what
you can do.

There is not much sport this
week due to bad weather and
all matches on Saturday and
Wednesday at Harlington
being cancelled due to
w a t e r l o g g e d p i t c h e s .
H o w e v e r , the E v e l y n
Gardens football champion-
ships was decided.
Bernard Sunley H o u s e
maintained their 100%
record to win the Evelyn
G a r d e n s H o u s e s
C h a m p i o n s h i p . T h e
traditional c r u n c h match
between the two all-male
houses in Evelyn G a r d e n s ,
Bernard Sunley and
Holbein, settled the 85/86
c h a m p i o n s h i p
After a fairly even first
ten minutes Bernard S u n l e y
tripped up when Scott
G o r d o n picked up the ball
in the box and slipped it
under the keeper to go one
up. Almost immediately
from the restart a long ball
from just inside the half
was misjudged by the B S H
keeper and b o u n c e d over
his head and into the back
of the net.
After another ten minutes
B S H winger B y r o n W o o d
picked up the ball, passed
a couple of backs and
squared it to a waiting
Steve J a m e s who calmly
placed the ball out of the
keeper's reach 2-1.
With Bernard S u n l e y now
dominating the g a m e the
next goal was a
surprisingly long time
c o m i n g , but o n c e again
Steve J a m e s m a n a g e d to
out-fox the keeper and find
the net.
A b o u t five minutes before
half-time B y r o n W o o d
broke through on the right
wing and planted one in
the top left of the net. B S H
then had to absorb s o m e
pressure with R o b James,
Laurence Covill and A n d y
Watson making a solid
barrier, with help from a
still drunk M a r c u s
Shepherd.
Immediately after half-
time Steve Wilkinson
picked the ball up at the
top of the box and blasted
one past the keeper to find
the goal.
B y r o n W o o d got the fifth
taking it round the keeper
on the edge of the box,
then beating two defenders
standing on the line.
With A n d y Watson
jinking and jiving on the
right and R o b J a m e s
stopping anyone and
anything on the left B S H
were c o p i n g well at the
back. L a u r e n c e (Fog-horn)
Covill took all the high
balls and could have
swallowed the ball if he had
o p e n e d his mouth a little
wider.
B y r o n W o o d completed
his hat-trick to make B S H
6-2 up. Holbein then put
the Bernard S u n l e y goal
under pressure with s o m e
g o o d runs by A n d y Keelin
and Scott G o r d o n . T h e
B S H keeper redeemed
himself in part with a
couple of saves and s o m e
rapid hoofing by M a l c o l m
J o n e s , Lai Covill and
M a r c u s S h e p h e r d , w h o was
sobering up by now but
was not keen on heading,
saw B S H through to the
final whistle.

Last Saturday the Imperial
C o l l e g e Sailing team set off
for the first match of the
term against Bristol
University.
T h e first race sailed
looked as if it was going to
be a very close finish, with
s o m e very g o o d sailing
c o m i n g from both teams,
until the last lap when two
members of the opposition
d e c i d e d to s h o w us the
best way to sink a firefly.
Fortunately the boat was
dragged to the shore and
emptied before it sank
completely.
After lunch the
resumption of racing was
delayed due to a squall
passing over, during w h i c h
various members of both
teams set about
demonstrating their
capsizing skills. Not
satisfied with this s o m e o n e
tried sailing away from the
jetty leaving half a tiller
extension behind and
almost collided with other
boats tied up there.
By the end of the squall
there were 4 boats, 6 helms
and 5 crews still ready to
sail. R a c i n g was then
resumed, involving s o m e
very competitive sailing
with all previous d u c k i n g s
forgotten.
