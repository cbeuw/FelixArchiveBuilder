I can't imagine the boring,
stoop-shouldered,
dandruff-ridden Imperial
lecturers even thinking
about something as
interesting as central
heating. H e n c e it c o m e s as
a bit of a s h o c k to read a
book where s o m e
a c a d e m i c s think about
s u c h youthful activities as
sex, and put thought into
action.
T w o professors, o n e
English and the other
A m e r i c a n , s w o p jobs for six
months, and have all sorts
of merry capers. Z a p p , the
wised-up A m e r i c a n , c o m e s
over with a planeload of
pregnant w o m e n on their
way to an abortion clinic
and ends up being attacked
by a former head of
department who's e s c a p e d
from a local lunatic a s y l u m .
Philip, the quiet retiring
Englishman, gets arrested
for stealing bricks and has
a Black Panther in his
office. A d d to this a Lotus
sports car, student
activism, a drug crazed
orgy and a radical phone-in
radio programme and the
ingredients are mixed for a
feast of hilarity.
It may s o u n d a bit
incestuous for a Professor
of modern English
Literature to write a book
about another two
professors of English
Literature, but the
technique pays off to give a
brilliant book, w h i c h is one
of the few I'd ever have
treated myself to. Published
by P e n g u i n , price £1.95.

Masquerading as a cassette
pretending to be a set of
pictures, the Meridians
package has long puzzled
pundits. Presented in a
plastic wallet is a thinly
disguised C60 music tape,
along with 30-plus pages of
propaganda and artwork
from some of Britain's
leading designers (below).
The entire oeuvre is
distributed by Rough
Trade, perhaps a final
gesture before all their
artists defect to Virgin.
Love and Kisses.
•Kiss Of The Spider
Woman (or Kiss to its
friends) is Hector
B a b e n c o ' s (Pixote) new
film of love and death in a
political prison, based on
the novel by M a n u e l Puig.
Happily hetero William Hurt
plays M o l i n a , an A m e r i c a n
queen jailed for a civil
crime, but sharing his cell
with Valentin, (Raul Julia),
a political prisoner under
interrogation by the
Brazilian authorities.
Molina's romantic stories
gradually undermine his
masculinity and poigniantly
underline his impotence in
captivity, but his love of the
renegade lies side-by-side
with his intentions: to
inform on Valentin and
secure his parole.
Unfortunately, c r o s s and
d o u b l e - c r o s s mar the
spotless sheen of this
romantic movie. Puig's
characters demonstrate the
futility of male a g g r e s s i o n
with enchantment, and
Molina's violent death is as
m u c h an uncomfortable
plot shaper as it is a
betrayal of the sincerity of
the film. C l o s e your eyes
for that bit. A real s w o o n i e .
