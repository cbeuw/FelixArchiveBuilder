Rector attacks education policy
Strike Success
The Rector, Professor Eric Ash, speaks to representatives of AUT
NALGO, ASTMS and ICU.
Wednesday's day of action
staged by The Association of ^
Universities Teachers (AUT)
and the National and Local
Government Officers
Association (NALGO) has been
described by Union officials as
'very successful'. Nationally,
fourty-four universities were
affected and public meetings
were held in town centres
throughout the country. At
Imperial College many students
stayed away from lectures in a
gesture of support for the strike,
which also had support from IC
Union, and the Rector Professor
Eric Ash.
The strike's aim, as explained
in the FELIX strike S p e c i a l was
to outline the A U T ' s c o n c e r n
over spending cuts, and N A I G O
claim for higher wages.
J a n i c e Lewis, the branch
secretary of N A L G O was
'pleased' with the strike's
progress which achieved
'valuable national publicity'.
M a n y students did not cross the
picket lines and a number of
delivery vans were turned away.
In the Physics department only
75 (out of 200) turned up for
morning lectures.

Professor A s h explained the
effects cuts were having at
Imperial C o l l e g e . He told F E L I X
that the cutbacks of 15% by the
Universities Grants C o u n c i l
have 'made it difficult for

difficulty in filling vacant chairs
and a c a d e m i c posts as a result.
During his visit to the picket
lines on W e d n e s d a y the Rector
a n n o u n c e d his intention to
donate a days wages to S B S .
A founding member of the
S B S c a m p a i g n Professor Denis
N o b l e who held the chair of
Physiology at Oxford told F E L I X
of his c o n c e r n that 'during the
past 5 years the gap between
the U K ' s research s p e n d i n g and
that of its competitors has
increasd by 30%'. He went on to
say Britain benefits would if

that further action was likely in
the form of a one or two and a

on to express his thanks to IC

the only Western Nation to

research funds on defence.'
Shortage of funds at IC have
also led to the a b a n d o n i n g of

equipment, including a 'super

involving passing a new type of
laser through a cloud of atoms.
The work is now to be taken up

problem into the public light,
they can force the G o v e r n m e n t
