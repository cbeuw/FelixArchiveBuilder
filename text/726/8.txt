I Oh Christ!
'Christians need G o d
because of insecurity',
'irrational superstitions',
'hypocrites', they believe in
a G o d of vengence', 'Can't
think for themselves'. T h e s e
are s o m e of the many
criticisms of christians.
They are true, o n e or other
of these accusations
applies to different
Christians, but not just
Christians, but everybody.
Most people don't act in
the way they say and a lot
of people don't think for
themselves. It is well known
that many people follow the
crowd. Sometimes, with
Christianity it is easy to fall
in to the trap of just
following what vicar says
but this is because
christians are human and
suffer from the s a m e faults
as other people.
'No Tommy, it is NOT an early
form of pocket calculator...'
Christianity is...
Christianity is
fundamentally based on
just o n e c o m m a n d m e n t
w h i c h is expressed in two
ways:
1) Love G o d
2) Love your neighbour
This is the basis for all
the Christian church's
teaching. Admittedly, often
the wrong impression is
given, it is easy to think
that G o d is a ruthless
taskmaster ready to zap his
followers. There are many
philosophical arguments
about the existence of a
loving G o d , but these are
only aids to belief—belief
c o m e s from experience. I
believe the 49 bus goes to
S h e p h e r d s B u s h
G r e e n — b e c a u s e I've tried
it. Few people stay within
Christianity unless at
s o m e s point they
experience something
w h i c h makes them stay
throughout doubt. It w o u l d
be easy to shrug this off
by, 'I've never experienced
G o d — s o I needn't bother'.
However, that isn't
fair—You will never know
where the 49 bus goes
unless you try it.
Christian doctrines are
no more incredible than
s o m e of the things the
lecturers tell us, and yet
lecture notes are often
treated as infallible
d o c u m e n t s . Is what they
tell us in lectures a true
expression of reality or is it
just their personal view?
Christianity is sometimes
c o n s i d e r e d to be as
superstitious
waffle—considering so
many peoples (past and
present) have followed
these crazy motions they
can't be that silly.
Rules, rules, rules!
Christians are not
mindless m o r o n s who
enslave themselves to a set
of rules and c o d e s b e c a u s e
they can't think for
Philosophy
Eli, Eli, L e m e
sabachlthani?' (My G o d ,
my G o d , why hast thou
forsaken me?) T h e s e words
of the dying Christ are a
potent expression of
human fear and anguish in
the face of death. At the
low points in our own lives
we feel lonely, depayse',
incomplete and long for
reconciliation with another
totally sympathetic person,
we want our lives to make
sense, to be an expression
of something transcendent
and not merely self-
sufficient. Blaise Pascal
reminds me that the value
of all my other longings lies
in their reflection of this
o n e obsessive desire for
something to complete us.
But we are living in an age
w h i c h finds it hard to make
an act of faith and to reach
an awareness of the perfect
Other. That is not to say
that people do not feel the
presence of G o d . T h e y do,
but they are ill-prepared to
respond to these
promptings.
T h e problem is that we
have been dressing G o d up
in clothes which do not fit.
M o d e r n scepticism has
e x p o s e d the inadequacy of
themselves. O n e of the
promises that J e s u s made
to his disciples is that he
c a m e to set people free.
L a c k of rules is not
freedom—that's anarchy,
and w h o is free when fear
reigns. D o not murder,
rape(etc) are all rules but
without them our society
w o u l d crumble. I am not
saying laws are necessary
to ensure peace. I am not
being forced to keep any
religious rules—there is no
watchful eye ready to zap
me if I decide to rob a bank
or j u m p into bed with a
girl/bloke at every
opportunity.
I observe rules because
there are s o m e actions that
I believe are not for my
own health of soul and
happiness. I freely d e c i d e
to obey or not to
o b e y — w e l l not quite freely.
I still do things that I wish I
didn't, usually because I
felt like it. But to say 'I just
felt like it' is really a c o p -
out. What I mean is; a part
of my s u b - c o n s c i o u s still
dictates what I do. I am not
fully free to do what I
c h o o s e .
M o s t people admire
B i s h o p Tutu, Rev Martin
Luther K i n g and Mother
T h e r e s e b e c a u s e of what
they have done—things
w h i c h most people c o u l d
do, but don't. I doubt I
c o u l d give up everything to
speak for a minority or help
the p o o r b e c a u s e I a m not
'free'. Christianity has
helped me and many others
to be freer, to do what ever
I c h o o s e . That is part of
what J e s u s meant when he
said that he had c o m e to
set man free.
Admittedly part of
Christians' bad reputation
is due to that s o m e well-
meaning c h u r c h men have
formalised precisely what is
the best way to act, cutting
out human individuality.
T h i s is a fault of theirs, not
of Christianity.
What's your God?
Everyone has a mixture
of many s u b c o n s c i o u s and
c o n s c i o u s goals. Everyone
has a set of rules by w h i c h
they act—if they didn't they
w o u l d never do anything.
These guidelines will
d e p e n d on what a persons
goals are. Effectively,
everyone has their o w n
religion and worships
various g o d s s u c h as;
money, a g o o d job,
recognition....The question
is; what's yours!
Overview of feature
These five articles say
little about the multitude of
doctrines a n d theology
c o n n e c t e d with
Christianity. Nothing in
these articles would
convert anyone—that is not
the purpose. This feature is
an attempt to answer 'What
makes a Christian tick'. T h e
c o m m a n d m e n t to love G o d
implies relationship,
possible b e c a u s e (we-
believe) this transcendant
being b e c a m e s o m e o n e like
us.
If you ask several people
what a certain person they
all know is like, between
them they c o u l d give y o u a
fairly complete picture of
that person. If you ask just
one, the picture will be
dodgy. T h e s a m e applies
here, 4 people from very
different b a c k g r o u n d s give
an a c c o u n t of what is a
Christian. This way there is
a reasonable answer.

Is it that s o m e people

To Be A
Christian...
T h e world is incredibly
confusing. S o many ideas,
political, humanitarian,
scientific or religious are
bandied around, each
offering s o m e sort of ideal
for life, that it can be very
difficult to figure out w h i c h ,
if any of them, s h o u l d get
our attention. A d d to this
confusion the pressures of
a c a d e m i c work, social
activity, then, (later on in
life, making a career and
supporting a family and
you might think it quite a
reasonable to say 'I haven't
got time for G o d ' . Apart
from that many people say
that they are not the
'religious sort', (If s u c h a
person exists I w h i c h very
m u c h doubt) probably
meaning that their
conception of the average
c h u r c h - g o e r is so
unattractive as to be a
deterrent to any further
investigation of the
relevance and truth of G o d .
T h e 'I haven't got time for
G o d ' s y n d r o m e is a
disease. If J e s u s really was
the S o n of G o d ; if he really
does make claims on our
lives that need to be
answered, then it is
infinitely more important to
take the trouble to
seriously investigate
Christianity, than to go'to
two parties this week rather
than one. A s for the
'religious sort', d o e s J e s u s
fit the bill? W a s he wet,

W h e n I was sixteen, I
rejected what I had been
taught at s c h o o l , and by
my parents about G o d . I
found I had no evidence for
my belief, and with no
foundation it c r u m b l e d
under testing. S o I started
to look for reasons to
believe. A s I looked I met
people w h o had done the
s a m e thing and w h o s e lives
had c h a n g e d on finding
G o d . While I searched for
G o d , J e s u s reached out for
me, until after a period of
time I knew that I believed
that J e s u s was the S o n of
G o d a n d had really c o m e
to help all of us. S o I
d e c i d e d to follow his
teaching and commit my
life to H i m . I did not have
proof in the mathematical
sense, rather sufficient
evidence to take a step of
faith. Faith is not m u c h
more than acting on
reasonable evidence. A first
time jet passenger may be
incredibly uncertain before
flying despite ample
evidence that the plane is
very unlikely to crash.
However, after a s u c c e s s f u l
first flight, he probably has
more faith in planes and
may be willing to go on a
slightly longer journey. A l l
of us exercise faith in s o m e
way every day.
My faith in G o d means
several things. First of all I
k n o w G o d loves me
personally despite my
apparent insignificance and
b e c a u s e of his infinite
power and perfect nature. I
experience that love every
day in an inner peace in my
heart and through
answered prayer. Before
c o m i n g to university I spent
eight months w o r k n g
outside of E u r o p e in a
small town, in the middle of
what s e e m e d like no-where.
Everything went wrong that
c o u l d have, yet, s o m e h o w ,
b e c a u s e G o d answered my
prayers, I survived and
eventually overcame the
problems. S e c o n d l y , it
m e a n s that b e c a u s e J e s u s
Christ died s o m e h o w
taking on himself all the
punishment for all the sins
I have ever committed or
will commit, that I will be
with him after death.
Thirdly it means that
through the Holy Spirit I'm
not on my o w n trying to do
what is right, but H e gives
me insight into what is
g o o d and what is not, and
power to do what is right.
T h r o u g h G o d there is
purpose, peace, h o p e a n d
eternal life. I believe that he
gives a freedom and joy in
life that can c o m e from no
other source.
A n d r e w Pettman
C h e m E n g 4
Many of our ideas about
G o d are fuzzy to so we
cannot afford to sit back on
our laurels. In order to
acquire a better
understanding of the
mysteries of life we need to
find them, to abstract
ourselves from the
d e m a n d s of daily life and
develop an inner quiet. •
That alone is a step
forward. O n the other hand,
anger is a very g o o d
response. A s in personal
relations, anger is that
other face of love and
where it exists there is
hope of eventual
reconcilation. It is
indifference w h i c h c l o s e s
the mind.
G o d speaks to us in
different ways. Personally, I
feel closest to him when I
am enjoying the arts;
reading a beautiful p o e m ,
gazing at an enchanting
painting or listening to
m u s i c . It is then that I
experience moments of
coherence, fleeting but very
real and full of joy. It is the
split s e c o n d before s u c h a
moment that is captured by
Michelangelo's finger of
G o d about to anihilate a
listless A d a m . M a n y people
tend to be s u s p i c i o u s of
any kind of religious
experience, dismissing it as
mere auto-suggestion. But
He c o u l d deny that we are
all made to long for
something or s o m e one
capable of answering our
inner needs. C S Lewis
perceived the value of this
craving when he said, 'Our
best havings are wantings.
S o m e w h e r e deep within
our hearts lies a very
personal search for G o d
w h i c h keeps breaking
through.
S u s a n C o n n o l l y
A Liberal View
T h e distinguishing
feature of liberal theology
is it's reliance on the power
of reason. I believe that all
o p i n i o n s are worth talking
out, even those of D o n
Cupitt, w h o might believe
in G o d but might not.
Reason ought to rapidly
sort out the g o o d ideas
from the bad ones.
Just b e c a u s e liberals rely
on reason does not mean
they are rationalists. After
all, logic is the most sterile
of the sciences. All it can
do is to s h o w that a set of
propositions (if they are
expressed clearly) do not
contradict. T h e World's real
problems involve finding
where to start.
This is why J e s u s never
wrote any b o o k s and never
founded any s c h o o l s of
thought. H e did not select
his followers by quizzing
them on their ideas about
G o d , religion, morality or
e c o n o m i c s he simply said:
'Follow me'.
He had his priorities
right. He thought that
doctrines were less
important than people so
he broke the religious rules
w h e n they hurt people. H e
thought that things were
less important than people,
so he s h o w e d people that
they c o u l d live happier lives
if they gave up their hold
on their posessions. H e
believed in Love and he
was prepared to die rather
than express hate.
T o d a y , we have to look
seriously at the example of
J e s u s (the doctrines about
him too often dir.ict us
from following him). W o u l d
our world be better if we
cared more about starving
people than about
defending ourselves with
w e a p o n s we dare not use?
W o u l d we not be a happier
people if we cared more
about living and less about
collecting the gadgets that
characterise Western
c o n s u m e r societies? W o u l d
we not be a happier society
if we treated people as
more important than
bureaucratic rules? T h e s e
are the sort of questions we
have to ask if we are to
follow J e s u s now.
W e look to his example,
that tell us where to start.
We must try to follow him
before it b e c o m e s
worthwhile arguing about
theology. Christianity has
to be tried to be believed, it
does not have to be
believed to be tried.
