Computers That Can Taste

replaced by a continuously
flowing solution w h i c h
contains the necessary
nutrients. T h i s technique
has many advantages over
more conventional methods
of crop growth, in
particular, as crop yields
can be increased by as
much as tenfold, more
efficient use of glasshouses
is possible. It also allows
for better control ?f plant
growth, less trouble from
pests, and a quicker turn
round between crops.
However, it is important
that p H is controlled, that
the nutrient solution is
replenished with iron,
potassium, and nitrate ions
as they are used up by the
plants, and that the build
up of undesirable ions s u c h
as chloride and s o d i u m is
monitored the design of the
automatic nutrient film
analyser is based on ion
selective electrodes. T h e s e
use a carrier, impregnated
in a membrane, to bind the
target ion in the right sized
cavity and transport it
across the membrane. For
example, in the case of
potassium ions a naturally
o c c u r i n g c o m p o u n d
valinomycin is used. T h e
potential w h i c h is
established across the
membrane provides a direct
measure of the
concentration. In the new
system a m i c r o c o m p u t e r is
used to calibrate the
electrodes, control the
sensors, sample the
nutrient, and analyse the
data. A n important aspect
of the system is that it c a n
be used and maintained by
non-specialised staff. At
present it is in use at the
National Institute of
Agricultural Engineering
and has successfully
monitored tomato crops
throughout two g r o w i n g
seasons.
A n electrochemical
sensor designed to
measure expired carbon
dioxide has been developed
by Professor Albery,
H u m p h r e y D r u m m o n d , and
Bill Y o u n g in collabration
with Dr Han of the
Radcliffe Infirmary, O x f o r d .
This sensor was p r o d u c e d
to monitor patients in
intensive care, and for use
; in the operating theatre It
makes use of a teflon
; membrane, w h i c h allows
oxygen and carbon dioxide
to pass through, to
separate the expired air
from the thin layer of
; solution in w h i c h the
electrochemistry takes
place. B e c a u s e c a r b o n
dioxide is electrochemically
stable to even large
voltages (2-3v), the action
of the sensor depends on
reduction of o x y g e n to
generate the highly reactive
superoxide ion, w h i c h then
reacts with the carbon
dioxide. T h e concentration
of c a r b o n dioxide is then
calculated from the
difference between the
amount of superoxide
generated and the amount
recovered. This can all be
achieved so rapidly that it
is possible to display a
breath by breath analysis of
expired c a r b o n dioxide.
By c o u p l i n g e n z y m e s
with electrodes a very
sophisticated and selective
recognition can be
achieved. Professor Albery
and Dr C a s s are working
on a number of important
new biosensors which take
advantage of the catalytic
activity and specificity of
enzymes.
A n important
breakthrough has been the
the development of a
biosensor to detect alcohol.
T h e sensor, w h i c h has
T h e result is a sensor
where the current is
directly proportional to the
concentration of the
alcolol.
There is also a g l u c o s e
biosensor, which has been
developed by Professor
Albery, Dr C a s s and Derek
Craston, that is of similar
design to the alcohol
sensor. However, it is
based on the
oxidation/reduction of
F A D H / F A D . Recent tests of
this sensor, carried out by
Dr Fillenz at O x f o r d , have
s h o w n that it can be used
to measure blood g l u c o s e
levels in vivo. S o it should
prove extremely valuable in
treatment of diabetes, as
well as for fermentation
control, and tests on meat
freshness.
T h e 'electrochemical
canary', which is a
biosensor d e s i g n e d to
detect toxic gases s u c h as
hydrogen sulphide and
hydrogen cyanide, is
another project that Dr
C a s s and Professor Albery
are collaborating o n , along
with S Shiu. This sensor
been developed by
Professor Albery, Dr C a s s
and K S i m , s h o u l d find
application in process
control of fermentation, for
c u s t o m s a n d e x c i s e to test
alcohol content of spirits,
and in the production of a
more efficent breathalyser
for police use. But its major
importance lies in the fact
that this action is based on
the oxidation of N A D H to
N A D as there are over 250
enzymes that use the
cofactor N A D / N A D H . T h i s
o p e n s up the possiblity of
constructing e n z y m e s
electrodes of this type with
a wide range of
applications.
T h e alcohol biosensor
takes advantage of the
catalytic activity of the
enzyme. A piece of dialysis
membrane, w h i c h allows
the substrate (in this case
alcohol) to pass through, is
used to trap the e n z y m e in
a solution layer next to the
electrode. T h e e n z y m e then
acts as a catalyst for the
reaction between N A D and
the substrate, p r o d u c i n g
N A D H .
T h e electrode is made of
a strongly c o n d u c t i n g
organic salt specially
c h o s e n by the term, w h i c h
absorbs the e n y z m e on its
surface, but more
importantly facilitates the
oxidation of N A D H to N A D .
s h o u l d prove to be
extremely valuable for use
on oil rigs, as well as for
general environmental
monitoring. At low
concentration levels
hydrogen sulphide gas is
easily detectable because
of its pungent odour, but at
higher levels it cannot be
detected by smell. This is
particularly a problem for
the oil industry, as oil often
contains pockets of other
gases, and in the past
accidents have led to
deaths from hydrogen
sulphide p o i s o n i n g . T h e
e n z y m e at present used in
the sensors c o m e s from
beef heart, and is the one
that is actually affected if
the toxic gases enter the
body. However, the sensor
might be required to
remain inactive for long
periods of time before it is
needed, and the long term
stability of this particular
enzyme is proving to be a
problem. S o the team are
looking for other more
stable naturally occurring
enzymes, or at the
possibility of genetic
manipulation.
Dr C a s s ' s group have
also developed a
paracetamol biosensor
w h i c h is in the process of
g o i n g into c o m m e r c i a l
production. This is an
extremely valuable sensor
as it can be used by
hospital staff to rapidly
assess the extent of an
overdose, s o helping to
save lives. At present, the
group are also working on
sensors to measure the
extent of water pollution by
insecticides.
Electrochemical sensors
have an important role to
play in the future of
science. But the
development of new
sensors requires
collaboration between
scientists of different
disciplines including
electrical engineers,
chemists, biochemists, a n d
biotechnologists. S o it was
with this in mind that the
S c i e n c e and Engineering
Research C o u n c i l recently
l a u n c h e d a special initiative
to support and e n c o u r a g e
this type of interdisciplinary
work in universities and
polytechnics. It is hoped
that ultimately the
development of new
sensors c o u l d lead to the
establishment of a new
high technology industry in
the United K i n g d o m .
