Whenever you criticise the
superheroes who make up
the FELIX staff, you s h o u l d
keep in mind that you are
privileged to receive free
o n e of the best student
magazines on the market. I
now feel able to make this
claim as I have had a look
at s o m e of the so-called
'competition'.
Queen Mary College
Student Union have an
organ called Cub. Last term
they wasted a third of a
page ranting about the loss
of their wretched mascot
Mary w h i c h was stolen by
Imperial's own Royal
College of Science (it
makes you proud, doesn't
it!). They begged for
information leading to the
abduction of either the
R C S U mascot Theta or the
I C U mascot Mike, but since
Theta and M i k e are both
still safe and s o u n d , we can
see that their c a m p a i g n has
been marvellously
unsucessful. M i n d y o u ,
what can you expact from
QMCII
Y o u might think that the
Royal College of Art would
be able to p r o d u c e a well
designed, well laid out, and
artistic publication, even if
on a shoestring budget.
Dodo Express, the new
R C A S U magazine not only
dispels the myth that artists
have any imagination or
style, but also has the
d u b i o u s distinction of
making Guildsheet look like
the Financial Times. T h e
lousy illustrations, boring
layout, and infantile
material suggest to me that
the Dodo Express staff
spend too m u c h time
painting nude models, a n d
really need to get their
teeth into a g o o d problem
sheet. Of course the
magazine was printed on
trendy recycled paper, and
I s u p p o s e that's what
counts!?
University College is the
biggest college in L o n d o n
University. I find it strange
then, that Pi is so badly
p r o d u c e d . In a feature they
did on student magazines,
they claimed that they were
the only student newspaper
in L o n d o n that c a m e out
every week — this, as every
FELIX reader knows, is an
untruth, a lie, and could
almost be described as
libellous. They also said
that they were one of the
few student magazines to
be produced internally and
proceeded to use this as an
excuse for the fact that PI
is so unattractive to look at.
FELIX is internally
p r o d u c e d , and it looks
g o o d , and our news is up
to date. In their 'feature', PI
played the dirty trick of
using our masthead in their
article without actually
saying anything about our
paper, thus tarring us with
the s a m e brush as the
other papers without
slagging us off overtly
(because they know that PI
wouldn't have a leg to
stand on if they tried to
slag us off). T o be blunt,
PI, though it has alot of
g o o d points, has a very
unprofessional look about
it: the layout is childish and
slipshod and it's use of the
English language is not
impressive (considering
that they have an English
department). PI has great
potential, but only if the
staff stop being so bloody
complacent!!
London Sudent, the
newspaper of the University
of London Union is the
only publication besides
FELIX which I C U gives out.
Fortunately, I cannot find it
in my heart to say anything
nasty about this
newspaper. It is too boring
for words. What can be
more boring, for instance,
than having T o n y S p e n c e r ,
ICU's Rag Mag editor, on
the front cover! Hopefully,
London Student will
disappear into oblivion,
thus saving the editors the
embarassment of being
associated with the least
read and least interesting
newspaper in L o n d o n .
National Student, on the
other hand, is a great
laugh. (It belongs to the
National Union of Students
to w h i c h , as you may know,
we have refused to pay lots
of money to join.) While
trying to imitate posy
magazines like The Face it
s u c c e e d s only in looking
like a poor relative, a mere
s h a d o w of the real thing. IC
students are actually
expected to pay for the
opportunity to fill in a
questionnaire with
questions along the lines of
'what do you think is the
Most Fab T h i n g or Person
in the whole world'. I would
suggest that this
publication be avoided — if
you want to buy a posy
magazine buy The Face,
Cosmopolitan, or Avant
Garde... at least they have
their own style (so I'm
told).
Of all the student papers
I looked at, the Birmingham
Sun was the most
fascinating. In three
subsequent issues they had
three different editors: a
racist Bangladeshi; a lefty
lesbian (she appointed one
person for news and
features together, but two
w o m e n ' s editors); and the
mysterious C o l i n Reed w h o
didn't even manage to
p r o d u c e a full issue. Their
styles differed as m u c h as
their staff did (you can see
from the credits w h o was
who's friend) and the sheer
bitchiness which must have
riddled their office must
have been a joy to behold...
the knives were certainly
being sharpened at A s t o n .
A n y w a y , back to IC
g o i n g s on next week... if
y o u p r o d u c e the goods. I
want lots of backbiting,
bitching, and general
nastiness. Please.
Well, lots of love kids...
and remember: FELIX is
too g o o d to risk.
