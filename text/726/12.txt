Wind Band
F r o m this term onwards,
the IC Wind B a n d will be
known as the IC C o n c e r t
B a n d . This new title is an
indication of the move to
improve the image of the
band, in order to increase
the membership and the
support.
M o r e challenging pieces
of a greater variety than
before will be played,
details to be a n n o u n c e d
later at the first rehearsal.
These will inevitably
require more practice , so
just one concert near the
end of each term is likely.
In the Winter and Spring
terms, this will be indoors!
Only the traditional
S u m m e r concert will be on
the Queen's L a w n .
A committee will be
formed in order to organise
the concerts, c h o o s e the
pieces to be played and
perhaps arrange s o m e
social events.
It is hoped that these
proposals will stir all you
Brass, W o o d w i n d and
P e r c u s s i o n players out
there into action. A s before,
players of all standards are
w e l c o m e and no auditions
are required. T h e first of
the regular M o n d a y
evening rehearsals this
term is on 20 J a n u a r y from
5.45pm to 7.15pm in the
Great Hall.

The sun, just past zenith,
beat d o w n upon the blazing
sands. H e controlled the
vehicle with a deft touch,
foot against the floor,
pondering upon his
journey's end.
It was Thor's day, and a
bad day for travelling. T h e
g o d of all electric storms
frowned upon internal
c o m b u s t i o n engines, they
reduced the impact of his
speciality.
Even so Maximilian had
to arrive at 'The B u i l d i n g '
and s o o n . Even now the
denizens of 'Psiphi' w o u l d
be gathering, and M a x i m i a n
was to address them, to
brief them on the daring
escape that was to take
place on S u n d a y .
O n the horizon, he
spotted a dark speck.
Undoubtedly this was the
remains of the ancient
computer centre. T h e 'Byte'
building.
Suddenly, from the right
he saw a flash of light.
A n o t h e r car! For a moment
panic filled him, but then,
as it drew nearer, he
recognised it. It would be a
duel to the death, but the
puny Huellzok c h a r a b a n c
was no match for his Laslar
L y r i c o n c u s t o m job.
T h e cars closed
relentlessly, a shot ripped
in to the engine couling.
Max lifted a grenade in his
right hand and waited. A s
the cars closed he caught a
view of the driver.
' S t o m m ! It's Rex Petes,
the man who drunk the
blood of Satamus!'
He threw the grenade, in
his minds eye, the
parabolic arc, and the
Huellzok converged at 1-10
and...
A deafening explosion
filled the air.
Max covered the
remaining mile in short
minutes and steered
through the arch.
He ran up the flights of
stairs and in to the green
room.
'Hi C o s m i c ! ' C o s m i c just
smiled, took the blaster
from behind his back and
lased M a x in the chest.
'Don't worry Max. It"s not
so m u c h an after life, more
sort of an apres vie!'

T h e Imperial C o l l e g e Barn
D a n c i n g society doesn't
exist! (groan..) Barn
D a n c i n g , though, lives and
thrives at Imperial C o l e g e s
(hooray...)
W H A T IS B A R N D A N C I N G ?
A s a recent convert to
the activity I can
understand the
apprehensions and
m i s c o n c e p t i o n s that lie in
the minds of Imperial
C o l l e g e students.
Fundamentally and
essentially Barn D a n c i n g is
a simple and fun activity.
N o experience or talent is
required, just a candid and
light-hearted a p p r o a c h to
entertainment. A band
plays cheerful, b o u n c y
music and the caller
skilfully manipulates the
atmosphere to create a
lively, intimate community.
You've witnessed the
G u i l d s carnival, you've
heard the B o o m a l a k a
resound in unlikely places,
but now for something
completely different...'The
Valentine's Barn Dance'.
E s c a p e from the stifling
city hassle to the candid
and lighthearted spirit of
the country. Don't be one
of life's spectators join in
and make fun on Friday,
14th February at the
Holland C l u b 'Barn'. T h e
tickets are obtainable from
the G u i l d s U n i o n Office at
a bargain price of £2.00.
