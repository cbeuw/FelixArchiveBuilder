A U T Strike
The A U T Strike on
W e d n e s d a y appears to
have been an e n o r m o u s
success. It gained a large
amount of coverage in the
national press. Professor
A s h is right when he says
that the general public
must be aware of the
problems facing
universities. T h i s means
that today's protest must be
followed by strikes, lobbies
and sit ins. T h e government
must be made to see that it
needs to invest in
education. IC U n i o n ,
traditionally an apathetic
union, needs to be part of
these protests. If IC
students protest the
government may take
notice. There is going to be
an election in next three
years and many universities
are in marginal seats.
Universities have influence.
We must s h o w the
government that we're
prepared to use that
influence against them if
they don't start investing in
education.
Nicaraguan Coffee
Student union services are
mean't to be services run
by students for students.
This means that if students
feel strongly about issues
like S o u t h Africa and
N i c a r a g u a they s h o u l d be
able to c h a n g e their
suppliers. It may not make
c o m m e r c i a l sense but if
you want a c o m m e r c i a l
meal you go to
M a c D o n a l d s and buy a
burger. Dave Kingston
should not have o p p o s e d
the motion on coffee at
Tuesday's U G M on
c o m m e r c i a l grounds. A s a
sabbatical you're meant to
work for students which
means you should listen to
their wishes.
Christmas Tree
We discovered this week
that our Christmas tree was
taken by the cleaners who
d e c i d e d that it was time to
clear up the office after
Christmas. W e would like
to appologise to Beit
Security who apparently
got in trouble after last
terms news story.

Dear Mr Beck,
Thank you for your letter
c o n c e r n i n g the rents for
single rooms in Hamlet
G a r d e n s . T h e reasons for
the revised bills are two-
fold:
(a) Head T e n a n c y flats
are rented on a 38 week
basis and the bills for the
year are usually divided
into A u t u m n T e r m and
Christmas Vacation, Easter
Term and Easter Vacation
and A u t u m n Term gas and
electricity, and S u m m e r
Term and Easter gas and
electricity.
At the beginning of term
I made the mistake of
allocating Hamlet G a r d e n s
on an 11 week basis, ie to
the end of the A u t u m n
| Term. T h u s at a later date
| (end of November) I
i a m m e n d e d the A u t u m n
Term bills to include the
| C h r i s t m a s Vacation.
(b) S o m e flats contain
single rooms. Hamlet
G a r d e n s is allocated in two
blocks (Flats 9-140 and
Flats 201-220). At the
beginning of term (when
allocating rooms) I was
only aware of 4 of these.
During the first couple of
weeks s o m e people came
in and told me they were in
singles and I altered their
bills. During the term
various attempts were
made to discover who else
had single rooms. T h u s
when D e c e m b e r c a m e
along I felt that these bills
needed sorting out before
the end of term. T h u s I
selected people at random
and sent them new bills
along with the covering
letter.
W h e n your groups signed
up for the flat you entered
into a contract to pay a
certain amount of rent per
week. W h e n the flat
o c c u p a n t s received their
bills it would have been
obvious to make sure that
the weekly bill was correct.
Also, the people in double
rooms surely would have
raised questions as to why
they were paying the s a m e
as those in single rooms.
I apologise for the
seeming lack of
c o m m u n i c a t i o n and
apparent interest from
myself (charges which I
heartily deny) and the
trouble which has been
c a u s e d by the re-issuing of
bills. Steps have now been
taken to improve the
c h e c k i n g of dates of stay
and rents charged.
Yours sincerely.
