Fowler Foul-Up
A report in last
W e d n e s d a y ' s G U A R D I A N
reveals that a G o v e r n m e n t
'cover up' has resulted in
thousands of misinformed
students claiming benefits
to which they were not
entitled.
T h e mistake o c c u r r e d
when S o c i a l Services
Secretary M r N o r m a n
Fowler released premature
information to the press o n
half of the Department of
Health a n d S o c i a l Security,
a n n o u n c i n g c h a n g e s w h i c h
would have allowed
students under covenant to
claim supplementary
benefit during the s u m m e r
vacation. In fact, these new
regulations were withdrawn
in late November, a few
days before they were d u e
to be passed by parliament.
Mr Fowler c h o s e not to
issue another statement ..
a n n o u n c i n g the
postponement, informing
only his staff of the c h a n g e ,
via an internal circular. T h i s
in effect, misled Students
into believing that they
c o u l d receive this benefit
on top of their parents'
convenant payments.
W h e n questioned by
FELIX, a Senior D H S S
Official denied the
G U A R D I A N ' S allegation
that the withdrawal c a m e
about b e c a u s e of drafting
errors of the type that led
to last year's 'Board a n d
lodgings' court case, in
which another set of D H S S
regulations were d e e m e d
illegal by the C o m m o n s
Statutory Instruments
Committee. A l t h o u g h these
latest rules still await
confirmation to b e c o m e
part of the benefit c h a n g e s
reported in last week's
issue, the official assured
F E L I X that all students w h o
mistakenly claimed have
actually been reimbursed
by special payment. H e
c o u l d , however, find 'no
apparent reason' for M r
Fowler's action.
Bar Staff
A proposal w h i c h aims to
e n c o u r a g e tie c l u b
members to work in the
U n i o n bar o n w e e k d a y s
was given u n a n i m o u s
support at M o n d a y s
Internal Services
C o m m i t t e e . T h o s e present
at the meeting included
Carl Burgess, Dave
Kingston, Quentin Fontana,
and M o o r e Lyttle the U n i o n
Bar Manager. Quentin
Fontana hopes that the tie
clubs will take to drinking
in the bar as a result of the
move. H e denied the
suggestion that ordinary
students wishing to work in
the bar would be placed at
a disadvantage.
Pete W i l s o n IC U n i o n
Welfare Officer is worried
that there would be fewer
bar s e s s i o n s available for
'ordinary students', a n d is
also c o n c e r n e d that the bar
will b e c o m e inevitably tie
club orientated.'
NUS Slam
DHSS Cuts
Students will lose up to
£1100 through being
unable to claim
supplementary a n d housing
benefit over the s u m m e r
holidays, claims N U S vice
president Vicki Phillips.
O n e result of this is that
many students may have tc
give up their courses.
T h e G o v e r n m e n t
explanation for the cuts is
the high administration
costs of running the
benefits. A c c o r d i n g to the
G o v e r n m e n t for
supplementary benefits of
£4 million, administration
cost were £2 million, a n d
for housing benefits of £5
million, £3 million were
spent on administration.

Going Through The Motions
T h e A U T Strike, a c a d e m i c
affairs a n d N i c a r a g u a n
coffee were d i s c u s s e d at a
lively U n i o n General
Meeting ( U G M ) o n
Tuesday. T h e venue was,
unusually, C i v E n g 201
after it was discovered on
M o n d a y that the Great Hall
had not been b o o k e d .
The meeting voted
overwhelmingly to support
the A U T strike a n d
requested students not to
attend lectures o n
Wednesday morning. Full
details appeared in a
special strike issue of
F E L I X on W e d n e s d a y .
Earlier in the meeting,
President Carl B u r g e s s w a s
repeatedly questioned
about the proposed move
of the F E L I X Office to the
kitchen behind the L o u n g e .
He made it clear that he
was sympathetic to the
latest in a long line of J o h n
Smith imspired s c h e m e s to
take over U n i o n Controlled
areas.
Several c h a n g e s to the
U n i o n B y - L a w s were
approved. Three related to
the creation of a post of
W o m e n ' s Officer a n d
setting up a B a r C o m m i t t e e
to oversee the managing of
the newly Union-controlled
Bar.
Following the A U T
Debate the s e c o n d part of
Taylor's a c a d e m i c affairs
motion was passed. This
means that the U n i o n has
c o m p r e h e n s i v e polices on
the issue that affect it's
members everyday life.
T h e meeting then moved
on to d i s c u s s whether the
U n i o n S n a c k B a r should
serve Nicaraguan coffee.
Proposer Pete H o b b i s said
that the money raised by
the sale of the coffee w o u l d
go to help pay for
education, which was badly
affected by the civil war
and the U S embargo on
trade. T h e coffee was only
a little more expensive than
that the S n a c k B a r
currently used, amounting
to only o n e penny per c u p .
Deputy President Dave
Kingston o p p o s e d the
motion, saying that
decisions affecting the
management of U n i o n
Trading activities should
not be made by U G M s ,
even if the intention w a s to
support a g o o d cause. T h e
motion was then a m e n d e d
to from a request to sell the
coffee, but M r Kingston
was still o p p o s e d to it.
However, o n the vote the
motion received a
substantial majority.
