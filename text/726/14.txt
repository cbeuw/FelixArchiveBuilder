It is my deep suspicion that when the bomb finally drops and
leaves a population of cockroaches with a lifetime supply of
medium rare human that somewhere among the ruins there
will still be a computer sending out unwanted mail shots.
Picture the scene as two yuppie cockroaches sit breakfasting
on fillet of chartered accountant and opening endless offers
for the WHICH 'Guide to Back Pain, and how to inflict it'.
Sick? Well in an infinite universe anything is possible, even a
planet where people indulge in S & M pornography while 70
governments indulge in institutionalised torture. Maybe you
need a sick mind to survive in a sick world. Students in
particularly, seem tostretch the limits of human sensibility in
search o f diversion a n d entertainment. S o this week it
seemed a neat idea to check out some of the good honest gore
on offer.
A s Albanian mountain cyclist Eugene Z h o g once said 'A
puncture can reallyfuck up your day'. Well its punctures of a
different kind (ie. in the head) that have the same effect for
various randoms in the film Re-Animator which opens on Jan
17th at the Odeon Kensington among other places. This is
going to be a cult film. Its based on an H.P.Lovecraft book
and oozes zombies, mad scientists and death (temporary
only).
If cult/gore films are what y o u crave, the place to
remember is the Scala cinema near Kings Cross. They have
regular re-runs of all sorts of cult and 'art' (ho! ho! we know
what they mean) films, and also Saturday all-night
screenings o f multiple bills which are extremely good value.
They ran showings of The Evil Dead as part of a campaign
against its banning on video last year.
F o r all you telly fetishists the controversial bit of the B B C 2
thriller DeadHead is screened next Wednesday. Meanwhile if
you want something which will really freak you out, the
documentary Silent Twins ( B B C 2 , Sunday 10.10-11.40) is an
eerie story about two twins now in Broadmoor psychiatric
prison. This unfortunately clashes with Spitting Images and
so will probably be missed by most people. L o o k i n g around
at what we watch for entertainment leads one to reflect that
IC Rag Mags are pretty tame stuff-not so much evil as boring
