Street Fighter Alpha 3 (PSX)
Virgin Interactive
Having set myself up by
saying this review would
be in last week's Felix I
managed to get the viral
infection, second cousin
to influenza and a dis-
tant relation to ebola,
which put me on my
back, on the toilet and
over the bucket for a
week and a half. Let that
be a lesson to me, never
promise an issue. Any-
way excuse and virus
over It's time to kick back
with a vengeance, the
capcom 2D fighter is
back... again.
Street Fighter Alpha 3,
begot of Street fighter 2, begot of Street
fighter Alpha, begot of... well there is
more heritage in this game than in the
whole of Chelsea football club. Over
time and over several generations of
consoles and computers Street Fighter
has been the beat-em-up which all oth-
ers have tried to match, or perhaps to be
more accurate the 2D beat-em-up to
beat - the 3D and the copycat 2.5D boys
left this battlefield behind and moved on
to the world of floating cameras and
populated polygon muscles. Street
Fighter Alpha 3 (oh alright SFA3) at the
arcade is still capcom's little jewel in an
otherwise corroded crown and fortu-
nately, despite running on a less than
arcade powered machine, the Playstation
version is impressively good.
The graphics are as you would
expect of the capcom world, cartoon
and 2D. But very good cartoon and 2D
graphics they are too. The claimed loads
of frames per second are probably all
there - once again they were a little too
quick to count, but just because they are
quick doesn't mean that they are not
smooth. In fact they are galaxy chocolate
smooth, and
noticeably so | |
across the incredi- m
bly detailed
(though flat) back |
grounds. With
graphics like Ihc s.
perhaps the cap-
com machines should be
replaced by a playstation
in a cabinet, and we might
have ten pence arcade
games again.
The sounds are
arcade quality. Well, as
most of the time the orig-
inal arcade machines
seem to be placed about
twenty centimetres away
from the in pub entertainment system, I
have no idea. Though for effect I played
this while borrowing my flatmate's hits of
the nineties tape on a poor quality
amstrad tape player. Turning the tape off
to listen to the game, I rapidly realised
that perhaps the position of the arcade
machine was not an accident. The sound
doesn't subtract anything from the game
but really doesn't add anything either.
Gameplay wise, err well yes I did
start to like it. You might realise that I'm
not the biggest fan of beat-em-ups and
even less so of 2D beat-em-ups, but this
one has all the options of the current
crowd. There are the simple one on one
fights, the team battles, even the ability
to customise the fighter's ability as you
gain experience while fighting a series of
fights. Once again as with most of the
beat-em-up world, playing against the
computer is OK, but the best battles are
against other more human opponents-
though make sure the competitive streak
doesn't boil over to re-enacting the
throwing moves in real life.
So it is a 2D beat-em-up that even I
recommend - rare praise indeed. If you
really need to beat-up sprites on the
playstation and you don't own the ear-
lier games it is definitely worth running
down to the shops and buying it. If you
are less aggressive and more pensive,
perhaps your local game rental shop can
help you discover your latent violent side
- though we take no responsibility for
your actions after a few drinks.

Infogrames
Good Graphics:
Nice scorched earth effects
for the ground, very com-
mand and conquer
pseudo-3D terrain, with the
usual cliffs, rivers, lakes and
fords. The actual machines
One line Summary:
Post-nuclear battle field Command and
Conquer Clone.
What's it all about:
The war to end all wars has come and
gone, leaving three distinct races fight-
ing another war - the war after the war
to end all wars except perhaps this final
war. So you have the survivors, a bunch
of military minded bunker based
humanoids, a bunch of mutated human
animal hybrids, and some artificially intel-
ligent metal monsters, all fighting for oil
and the blistered and blasted surface.
drop screaming bombs on their targets.
Nothing really special anywhere though.
Great Gameplay:
Well it is Command and Conquer, fhe
basic game is to collect oil to power the
powerstations which then allow you to
build more
tanks, infantry,
aircraft and
boats. While you
do this you
defend your
base with turrets
and research the
various buildings
to get bigger

Best bit:
It's almost as good as Red Alert... almost.
Worst Bit:
It's almost as good as Red Alert... almost...
the machines are too small and without
a mouse it can be a real pain to move
from one side of the map to the other.
So who will get it :
Red Alert fans.... err that's about it really.
If you want a Red Alert game buy Red
Alert.
incredibly
detailed, but at least they are smooth
moving. The explosions arc a little wimpy,
no blood or metal fragments, just a puff
of black smoke.
Seraphim Sounds:
Soundtrack alters according to which
side you play, though it's nothing special
for any of them - very sub C&C and Red
Alert. Various units make different bang
and splatting noises, even the aircraft
and better tanks,
infantry and other
bits. While not every
level follows this path
- some get you to
spring traps and
ambush enemy
troops - it is a case of
