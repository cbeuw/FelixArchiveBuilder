The S t u d e n t s ' N e w s p a p e r at Imperial C o l l e g e
Southside Blocks Locks
On Thursday 3 June, the Pro-rector,
Professor T i m Clark, c a m e to s p e a k to
Southside residents about the situation
of the blocks b e i n g put o n south-fac-
ing w i n d o w s . This w a s in r e s p o n s e to
a 180-strong petition f r o m the resi-
dents, b e i n g h a n d e d in to the Rector.
Many residents w e r e k e e n to put a
face to the p e o p l e b e h i n d the i n c o n -
venient obstruction a n d the turnout
ai the m e e t i n g w a s g o o d .
T h e Pro-rector b e g a n his a d d r e s s
by stating that the blocks had b e e n put
in as a r e s p o n s e to the s h o c k i n g inci-
dent (reported earlier this year in Felix)
where a resident's guests h a d th rown
bottles a n d peanut butter out o f a win-
dow, nearly m i s s i n g a passer-by a n d
damaging an a n t i q u e Ferrari. T h e sit-
uation not only c a u s e Imperial C o l l e g e
money in the c o v e r i n g the costs o f all
ihe repairs but had also d a m a g e d the
eputatlon a n d a f f e c t e d the p r o c e s s
and a c c e p t a n c e o f m a n y b u i l d i n g
applications. There had b e e n n o other

alternative, he concluded, but to imple-
m e n t the blocks to r e d u c e the ability
of o p e n i n g the w i n d o w s o n southside.
T h e H e a d of Estates, w h o was also
p r e s e n t i n f o r m e d r e s i d e n t s o f the
recent failed attempt to build another
hall o f r e s i d e n c e o n the tennis courts,
with a g y m u n d e r n e a t h . This w a s
rejected by the council with the help
of approximately 100 letters o f c o m -
plaint f r o m the local residents, w h o as
well as rejecting to the traffic it w o u l d
cause, believed students w e r e ' u n c o n -
trollable vandals' a n d b o i s t e r o u s in
their behaviour. T h e total lost to the
c o l l e g e h a d b e e n e s t i m a t e d to b e
a r o u n d a quarter of a million p o u n d s
as a result o f the investigation o f the
failed p l a n n i n g permission.
Residents put forward the ideas
that reflective film, fly-nets a n d netting
c o u l d be u s e d as alternatives to the
blocks already present, but care must
be taken with these m e t h o d s since
Southside is a listed building. A s u g -
gestion e v e n c a m e o f a g a r d e n fete
b e i n g held as a PR exercise to s h o w
the c o n v i n c e d local residents that not
e v e r y o n e in Southside was a vandal
a n d instinctive towards throwing bot-
tles out o f w i n d o w s . O n e resident
was c o n c e r n e d that expulsion should
lead for a student, after s u c h an inci-
dent but the Pro-rector and Dr Hassard.
Tizard a n d Selkirk w a r d e n , said there
had b e e n 'extenuating circumstances'
this time but the guests from other col-
leges were currently being prosecuted.
S u g g e s t i o n s w e r e also m a d e that
Southside security should be strength-
e n e d a n d a signing-in system installed,
as present at King's a n d C a m b r i d g e
University but the Pro-rector reported
that in his past post as a w a r d e n , this
system was not effective.
It was also revealed that only a
quarter of the incidents, w h e r e items
had b e e n thrown from Southside, had
c o m e from resident's windows, yet the
w i n d o w s w e r e still blocked.
It has b e e n stated by Estates and
the Pro-rector that any measure will be
temporary since the w h o l e building is
to be refurbished in a year's time. T h e
c o n c l u s i o n f r o m the m e e t i n g , how-
ever, was that the temporary measure
of blocks o n the w i n d o w s is not satis-
factory a n d has p r o v e n to b e very
inconvenient for students revising in
the hot weather in poorly ventilated
rooms. T h e residents asked for a swift
conclusion to the situation a n d called
for the removal of the blocks. The
m e e t i n g c o n c l u d e d with the under-
standing that the Pro-rector w o u l d take
an appropriate course of action after
deliberating the situation with his col-
leagues.
Sports Centre Swallows Southside

t h e C o l l e g e g r o u p is ' o p e n to all",
rather than Just to a specific m e m b e r -
ship list. M s N i c h o l a o u has cited the
M e m o r a n d u m o f U n d e r s t a n d i n g
b e t w e e n College a n d the U n i o n , which
guarantees the G y m and accompanying
Weights R o o m as "Designated wholly
for ICU activities", and discussion c o n -
tinues.
T h e other point o f contention is
the role of the G y m after the n e w
Sports Centre - c o m p l e t e with massive
sports hall - is constructed. According to
Mr Murray, under the agreement which
led to the College decision to d e v e l o p
the Sports Centre both the Southside
g y m a n d the weights r o o m will revert
to College use as part of the Soulhside
d e v e l o p m e n t w h e n the n e w Sports
Centre o p e n s . Most importantly. " N e i -
ther will be available for sports use,
either by ICU or the Sports & Leisure
Section".
Although plans for the Southside
complex have b e e n long known, c o n -
firmation that the G y m will n o longer be
available for sports activity puts a lot o f
pressure o n b o t h C o l l e g e a n d the
U n i o n to ensure that proposals for run-
ning the n e w Centre don't lead to any
loss of club facilities.
