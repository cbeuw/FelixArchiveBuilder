Behind the Times
Dear Felix,
I recently had the joy of s p e n d i n g
almost two hours waiting in the Health
Centre to be seen at the open clinic.
During this time I thought I would
relieve the frustration and boredom
by reading some of the provided mag-
azines. I perused the selection and
found the normal mixture of mostly
crappy magazines (Hello, fondon Mag-
azine, Antiques Today, What Car etc.).
I could not help but notice that at least
9 9 % of them were more than 6
months out of date. The oldest I found
was Which Car 1987! Felix and IC
Reporter seemed to be the only up to
date publications.
W h e n you're feeling under the
weather, it would be nice to have
some decent recent newspapers and
magazines. Surely it's worth spending
a small amount of cash to allow IC
Health Centre to break the trend set by
medical practices throughout the
country?

Personally, I'm supporting this
because I think that in today's society
there is a lot of exploitation, meaning
that a large percentage of people are
working more than necessary to support
their needs, the surplus work paying for
luxury cars, country houses and designer
suits. With a different set of priorities,
putting the emphasis on people, not
profit, business practices can be changed
and we can all spend more time in the
pub.

Mish-Mash and Medics
I think that s o m e people are "so self-
important and take things so seriously
that It's Just funny to take the piss out
of t h e m " - It Just seems unfortunate
that ICSM has b e c o m e the paradigm
for stereotypes that can be found In
most. If not all, departments. O n the
other hand. If I was doing a tough
course that lasted twice as long as
most of my peers, I think I'd feel a tad
Important. Can everyone stop being
over-sensitive now? - Ed
ICC Protest on 18 June Dear Feiix,
Ed,
According to a couple of flyers I've seen
the protest on June the 18th will start at
12pm at fiverpool Street station, with a
number o f ' targets' being hit in the City
during the course of the day, including
the Treasury in Whitehall, Gap, MaccyD's,
Smithfields meat market and the Reed
Employment agency. Reclaim The Streets
are going to be throwing a party in the
Square Mile and there should be some-
thing happening at Trafalgar Square
around 5.
The reason why people are protest-
ing is the belief that the global capitalist
system is at the root of our social and
ecological troubles. By protesting (or riot-
ing, partying etc) people hope to change
the perception that these problems can
be solved only by more growth and free
trade. For more details on
I feel I must defend Kevin from the ver-
itable onslaught he received in the let-
ters page last week.
I have to agree that the column
does sometimes focus too much on
Medics but to be honest I think that
some 'wannabe doctors' are so self-
important and take things so seriously
that it's just funny to take the piss out
of them.
Take the a n o n y m o u s first year
medic who wrote last week. I find it
hard to believe that s o m e o n e with
such a lack of humour was 'selected to
deal with people.'
Maybe he plays Rugby.
Yours,
A Physics Student.
