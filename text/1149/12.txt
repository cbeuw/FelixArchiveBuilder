Get Carter * * * *
Starring : Michael Caine, Ian Hendry, Britt Ekland, John Osborne, George Sewell
Director: Mike Hodges
T
he grand-daddy o f Tarantinoesque
movies, Get Carter is the definition
of seventies cool. Before Travolta
and Keitel started strutting their stuff
Michael Caine w a s d o i n g his thang in
Get Carter. Caine is Carter, a
smoothtalking hardman mobster from
London. Suspecting foul play after his
brother dies, h e decides to g o u p north
and investigate. However, h e ' s unwel-
come in t h e n e w n e i g h b o u r h o o d
because h e starts sticking his n o s e
where it is not wanted. S o o n h e gets
caught up in the local underworld a n d
manages to piss most o f the local
mafiosos off. Fortunately, Carter is as
hard as nails a n d c a n handle himself,
tte gets deeper a n d d e e p e r into the
rrystery of w h o killed his brother a n d
uncovers s o m e unpleasantly d o d g y
dealings at the s a m e time.
It's cool, trendy a n d streetwise.Jf
you're in the seventies. This film may be
where Tarantino got his inspiration for
Reservoir Dogs et al but the film is quite
dated. Sometimes the silly trousers are
off-putting, but if you can get past the
timewarp feel, the film is actually very
, good and it is easy to see why it's main-
"You're a bis} man, but you're In bad shape.'
tained its status as a cult classic. The film
has a hard, gritty e d g e which is missing
from most o f the n e w Hollywood films.
Caine is also perfect as the soulless,
avenging gangster. The contrast between
dry humour and brutal violence is brilliant
a n d makes the recent m o b flics pretty
tame in comparison. It is definitely worth
a look just to see h o w films should be
m a d e if you want them to be violent,
menacing and real.
A cold and calculated thriller which is
superbly handled by Caine, Oef Carter is
like a bottle of neat gin swallowed before
breakfast. D

0 Things l Hate AboutYou
Human Traffic
ffrr / London
Ihis is the soundtrack to a film that is des-
Ined to be massive this summer and the
soundtrack will be just as big.
The film accurately portrays clubbing in
the nineties and follows the story of a lost
weekend, charting the ups and inevitable
clowns of a posse of mates w h o g o club-
bing in Cardiff to get over the b o r e d o m o f
Iheir Mcjobs. Directed by Justin Kerrigan
(himself a 23 year old clubber) it also stars
fresh twenty-something talents a n d fea-
tures Carl Cox in his first acting role. T h e
soundtrack is a double C D of all the tunes
featured throughout the film including
.artists such as CJ Bolland, Fatboy slim. Lucid,
William Orbit, Armand Van Helden a n d
Energy 52 to name but a few. Naturally, for
a clubbing film, the soundtrack is for the
dubber in you. All the tunes have been
hand-picked by Pete Tong, w h o was the
music consultant for the film and w h o com-
Pled the soundtrack. O n c e you've seen the
film, then the soundtrack is a must. Out o n
June 14th.

Rush Hour
At last Jackie C h a n breaks into the big-
time. Hallelujah! With unsurpassable
balance, s p e e d and timing, he can take
a large part o f the credit for popularis-
ing H o n g K o n g c i n e m a in Britain a n d
the US - but until n o w his Hollywood
m o v i e s (First Strike, Rumble in the
Bronx, Mr Nice Cuy) have failed to
ignite the box office. Pair up his obvi-
ous physical talents and charisma with
Chris Tucker's brand o f Eddie Murphy-
e s q u e loud m o u t h comedy, however,
and it's pay day. Derivative, childish
and formulaic Rush Hour may be, but
it's never less than entertaining -
despite a n over concentration o n
Tucker's eye-rolling and gurning, and a
c o n s e q u e n t lack of classic Jackie Chan
action.
Hilary & Jackie
O n e o f the best British movies pro-
d u c e d s o far this year, Hilary & Jackie
has already garnered its fair share of
awards - a n d deservedly so, particularly
in t h e case o f Oscar-nominated stars
Emily Watson a n d Rachel Griffiths. The
real-life story o f l e g e n d a r y cellist
Jacqueline D u Pre and her long-suffer-
ing sister Hilary, it's touching, funny
a n d incredibly m o v i n g , largely thanks
to a s o u n d t r a c k w h i c h highlights
Jackie's a m a z i n g talent. Historically
accurate it m a y not b e , but the e m o -
tional, tear-jerking ending makes up for
all that.
What Dreams
May Come
Robin Williams career is the true defin-
ition o f hit-and-miss. For every great
role (Good Will Hunting, Good Morning
Vietnam, Aladdin) there's a complete
d o g (Flubber, Jack, Popeye). What
Dreams may Come falls o n o n e o f his
up-slopes - however, the movie itself
still s u c c e e d s in b e i n g pretty awful.
Cloyingly sentimental, director Vincent
Ward uses every computer effects tech-
nique available to create a limitless
vision o f the after-life. However, w h e n
the only thing g o i n g for a movie is its
effects (What Dreams is incredibly light
o n plot), there's not g o i n g to be m u c h
left by the time it hits the small screen.
Best avoided.
