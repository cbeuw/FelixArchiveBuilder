The Magic of Television
Those of you who would like to know
who Kevin is will be interested to know
Kevin's feet are going to be on Televi-
sion. Kevin was present when filming
for the Channel Four science documen-
tary Equinox was carried out in Physics
Lecture Theatre one last week. Bizarrely
the film crew spent at least as much
time filming students' feet walking up
and down the lecture theatre's steps as
they did filming the esteemed Imperial
College academic. Whilst being filmed
the academic stood at the front 'lectur-
ing' random garbled sentences. I assume
this piece of film will have a voice-over
by the time it is screened. Those of you
with good lip reading skills may pick up
some interesting gardening tips.
Technology Out of Control?
The swipe card controlled door at the
main entrance to Computing has been
misbehaving recently, occasionally result-
ing In small groups of computing stu-
dents being observed outside the door,
waiting for someone who has a swipe
that works in the door to come by and
let them in. Kevin finds it incredible Impe-
rial College of Science, Technology and
Medicine never
seems to have the
technology especially
when It comes to the
seemingly simple
things like doors and
lights.
Library PA
A Mostly Harmless Column by
Kevin has learnt that Kevin, a random entity who
during the summer a knows nothing about nothing
new Public Address •
system is going to be installed in the Cen-
tral Library. Unfortunately it is not going
to be used to broadcast the Library Atten-
dant's news announcements. Many
library users have supported the
announcements, although a few com-
plained at the disruption to study they
caused. The library unsurprisingly
responded with, "Those who wish to
have quiet in the Library must prevail".
The new PA system will come into its own
at closing time, when it will replace the
hand bell. Let's hope that lessons will be
learnt from the results of connecting the
BMS PA to a tyrannical computer and the
library system will not be attached to a
computer. Kevin has
nightmarish visions of
an ever-increasing
frequency of comput-
erised 'signals', cumu-
lating with
"beep...beep...beep...
on my next beep you
will leave the
library...". While we're
on this point, how
much time does it
take to you pick up
your books and walk
out of the library? Hopefully the PA sys-
tem will allow warnings to start perhaps
three minutes before closing rather than
the present thirty.
Fire Engine Sororities
Kevin watched a documentary on soror-
ities, Masonic style, social groups based
in American universities. One group fea-
tured even possessed their own fire
engine, which although a rather cool
idea, reminds me of a group here at IC.
I imagine these sororities to also serve no
real purpose and to be run by the same
small band of self-important individuals,
year after year.
The Joy of Caffeine
Whilst walking around the South Kens-
ington area ridiculously early on Sunday
morning, Kevin was amazed by the
amount of street wildlife. A huge num-
ber of pigeons and squirrels were mak-
ing good use of unfinished burgers and
alike. Something else that surprised Kevin
was the huge number of coffee shops in
the area. Kevin suspects that he is not the
first person to notice this, especially given
the degree to which caffeine culture has
pervaded the college; he has also
noticed the 'Caffeine Appreciation Soci-
ety' listed as an official ICU society. This
is the first reference to the society that
Kevin has seen. Perhaps someone could
tell me how I can get in touch.

Presidential Talk-Back
This week written by an alternative senior Union source.
Oh dear, it appears that the Union
President has failed to meet the copy
deadline for today. As I type he lies in
bed bemoaning his social skills (on
which I will shortly expand) whilst nurs-
ing a large hangover.
Last Wednesday night the
esteemed Mr Hellard ventured into
the wilds of East London to mix with
the Wideboys of Queen Mary & West-
field. Now, this may seem like this was
a rash idea but he did have an ultimate
goal. Steps...
You see, the QMW Summer Ball
had the masters of Brlt-SyncDance as
their main attraction. As the event cost
£45 and there was no meal then an
attraction such as this was essential to
pull the crowds in.
"Did young David "pull" a step?" I
hear you ask. At this moment it cannot
be confirmed; however, let's just think
about it.
The following information was
obtained from the "Planet Steps" web-
site. It is full of so much information
that it overwhelmed me. If you want
instructions (Including videos) of how
to dance like Steps then this is the
place for you!
1. H: WORDS YOU KEEP USING:
Fab & cool
2. Lisa: WORDS YOU KEEP USING:
Minger (horrible)
3. Lee: WORDS YOU KEEP USING:
Oh hello & cool
4. Claire: WORDS YOU KEEP USING:
Fantastic, really
5. Faye: WORDS YOU KEEP USING:
Lush
Claire and Dave - the perfect couple?
It is quite obvious therefore that an
immediate attraction would occur with
Claire due to their mutual overuse of
the word fantastic. She's also a big fan
of Celine Dion and Leonardo Di Caprio
so they have even more in common
than a first glance would indicate.
Here is their first conversation:
Dave Hellard: Wow you were fan-
tastic.
Claire Richards: Thanks, that's fan-
tastic.
DH: Did you know I'm the Presi-
dent of Imperial College Union? We
have the largest student venue in Lon-
don.
CR: Really?
DH: Yes, and our baguette bar is
fantastic plus I'm setting up a jobshop.
CR: Wow! Fantastic
DH: I know! Fantastic, isn't it?
CR: Fantastic!!
DH: Do you want to come to our
summer ball with me - it's going to be
fantastic!
CR: No. Bye.
So in conclusion, of course he did-
n't - don't be bloody ridiculous. There
is more chance of the man seeing
Chelsea win the league.
