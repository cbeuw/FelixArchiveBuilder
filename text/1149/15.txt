'Expander EP'
(Deconstruction) 5
A n absolutely brilliant single by o n e o f t h e world's finest DJs ever.
Sasha just g o e s f r o m strength to strength a n d has p i o n e e r e d t h e
epic genre practically by himself (but with a little help from his mate
Digweed). His latest EP, 'Expander' is not d e e p a n d m o o d y as y o u
w o u l d expect but m o r e 'tingly' with a catchy p i a n o tune, high key
synths a n d massive b r e a k d o w n s - all with a h a p p y g o lucky vibe.
There are n o vocals w h i c h is an a d d e d b o n u s as y o u can just enjoy
the music to its fullest. Brilliant EP f r o m t h e maestro.
O u t July 5th.

'Not Over Yet '99'
(Codeblue) 5
This tune is a d a n c e a n t h e m . It always h a s b e e n a n d always will
be, especially n o w as it gets a fresh m a k e o v e r for t h e s u m m e r .
Breeder a n d Matt Darey provide t h e n e w mixes, a n d although they
stick to the original very well, they have n o w both introduced extras
such as m o r e beats a n d a refined t u n c . Y o u don't really n e e d m e
to explain h o w b i g this t u n e is - t h e mixes will never m a t c h t h e
original but it's still o n e hell o f a track.
Out July 19th.
