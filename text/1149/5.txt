Competition
Win a Microsoft Game Controller!
The Microsoft Sidewinder Freestyle Pro
game controller is perfect for arcade-
style driving, flyincj a n d combat games.
Its internal motion sensor lets y o u con-
trol pitch a n d roll just by tilting the c o n -
troller in the direction you want to go. Or,
you can switch to digital (aka binary)
control, for a traditional g a m e pad feel.
"The biggest hardware surprise was
Tilt, Microsoft's n e w ( a n d very cool)
gamepad. With a solid-state motion sen-
sor providing proportional control along
the X- and Y-axis. Bv "tilting" the entire pad
left or right or forward a n d backwards
(hence the name), you can control vehi-
de and body movements independently
of the traditional D-pad (which can still be
used for a i m i n g w e a p o n s or controlling
other g a m i n g functions)."
