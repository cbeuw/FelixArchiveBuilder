Wipeout 64 (N64)

One line Summary:
There's much more bover with a hover
with a lobber.
What's It all about:
might be late with this but Wipeout 64
is the race game that the N64 had been
crying out for ages. Floating racers from
the playstation, armed to the teeth and
willing to eliminate contenders, race out
on the N64 with its superior polygon
handling skills, and there is no waiting for
loading off the CD either. Be fast, be very
fast but above all be deadly.
Good Graphics:
No pop-up, only a little bit of hazy dis-
tance but such smooth and slippery fast
motion. Only wipeout XL (the arcade
ride version) comes close; I could almost
love it to death.
Seraphim Sounds:
Sony says no way are you using the orig-
inal track... Midway goes out and gets
Fluke and Propellerheads and a few other
mates and records something better. A
bang on soundtrack for a bang on game.
Great Gameplay:
Wipeout 2 with an ana-
logue controller, a four
player all against all race
mode and with more
weapons including a very
effective machine gun - oh
it is so very good to be alive
and owning a N64. Almost
makes you want to buy a huge projection
TV to show the neighbours what they are
missing.
Sex and Violence:
The various craft are pretty sexy, but no...
absolutely no sex really. Violence... well
there Is plenty of metal bashing metal
and hot metal fragments piercing metal
skins. Wait a minute perhaps it is all sex-
ual.
Best bit:
The metalic voice announc-
ing that a contender has been
eliminated seconds after the
plasma bolt turned them into
a cloud of debris. The Graph-
ics, above all the graphics.
Worst Bit:
It's so much more difficult...
must... play... more... to...
get... better.
So who will get It :
Race fans. Nintendo 64 owners that have
an inkling of intelligence. Everyone else
with an inkling of intelligence - though
remember to buy a N64 to play it on...
and while you are at the store a very big
TV to go with it.
