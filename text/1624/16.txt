FILM
The top three
Oscar snubs
not involving
DiCaprio
W
ell it looks like the
drought is finally
over. After putting
out several arguably
‘Oscar-worthy’ performances
Leonardo DiCaprio may finally be
awarded his long awaited and joked-
about Oscar. We have Alejandro G.
Iñárritu and The Revenant to thank
for this. However, whilst DiCaprio
is the most famous repeat snubée
the Academy has a history of some
seriously massive blunders (*cough*
Chicago). Let’s look at some other
examples:
Andy Serkis
It’s an interesting debate when
you think about it. Can/should an
actor portraying a 100% computer-
generated character be recognised
by the Academy? It’s an interesting
debate when you think about it.
Should the Oscar not go to the
animators? Ultimately, with the
advancing precision of technology I
think that acting as a CG character
should be considered just as
legitimate as ‘real-life’performances.
Many people seemingly agree both
with this since, in 2011, thousands
petitioned a nomination for Serkis’
role in Rise of the Planet of the Apes.
Keep up with the times guys.
Tilda Swinton
OK, before you say it, yes we all
know she already has an Oscar. The
issue here is that in a world where
Bradley Cooper has been nominated
three times (Holy sweet lord Jesus,
how can anyone like American Hustle
or American Sniper?) the fact that
Tilda Swinton has only ever been
nominated once is getting more
and more ridiculous. In my opinion,
the snub for her portrayal of Eva in
We Need to Talk About Kevin is the
stand-out example of pure injustice.
Jamie Foxx
I don’t normally do this but let’s
keep this bullet point-level simple:
Django Unchained is a phenomenal
film; Jamie Foxx is perfect in it. Les
Misérables is a terrible film; Hugh
Jackman’s performance in it was
awful. Somebody go back to 2013
and swap these nominations. Thank
you.

The Suicide Squad trailer is not okay
W
hen it comes to
the shortcomings
of Marvel or DC’s
cinematic output,
as a self-confessed comic book fan-
boy, I’m usually pretty forgiving.
Unfortunately,the first official trailer
for DC’s latest film, Suicide Squad,
which dropped last week, hints at
a film with some serious flaws. It
might only be a two-minute trailer,
but the way it trivialises mental
health and sexualises its female cast
has me worried for its release this
August.
It begins by introducing the main
villains who make up the ‘Suicide
Squad’ – a group of ‘the most
dangerous people on the planet’
forced to work for the government
on impossible missions. Military
officer Rick Flag, played by Joel
Kinnaman, narrates the trailer,
describing each of his fellow squad
members as they appear on screen:
“Guy who shoots people. He’s a
crocodile and he eats people. Burns
people.You’re possessed by a witch.”
At this point, Harley Quinn (played
by Margot Robbie) appears on
screen: “And she’s just crazy.”
By defining Quinn by her mental
state, the filmmakers potentially
waste a complex and powerful
female character. The scene that
follows is even worse, in which she
hears voices and jokingly remarks
to the military force surrounding
universe. In one part, the Joker is
seen holding her in a toxic pool, a
scene that can also be found in her
latest comic origins tale, in which
she is forced to become the Joker’s
lover and side-kick, against her own
free will.It’s a story that is not in any
way empowering. At one point she
even wears a jacket with the words
‘Property of the Joker’ embroidered
on the back, further evidence that
the film will present Quinn as an
object under the Joker’s control.
The problems with her costume
don’t end there: along with the rest
of the female cast, she’s blatantly
sexualised, wearing underwear
whilst her male cohorts are covered
in layers of protective clothing.
While these issues alone are
troubling, what is more worrying
is that – as a major blockbuster
– the film is unlikely to start a
conversation about suicide or mental
health. As the world is starting to
wake up to the seriousness of these
issues, it’s disappointing that the
movie is being advertised in a way
that fetishises criminals and mental
health patients.Now all we can do is
wait and hope that the film is more
nuanced than its trailer.

her: “What was that? I should
kill everyone and escape? Sorry.
The voices. Haha, I’m kidding.
That’s not what they really said.”
Well done lads, you just trivialised
auditory hallucinations, a common
symptom of certain mental illnesses,
for comedic effect. It’s important
to remember that Suicide Squad
marks the live-action cinematic
debut of Harley Quinn, and for
many this might be their first – and
most lasting – introduction to the
character.
Further analysis of the trailer
hints at Harley Quinn’s supervillain
origins in the DC cinematic
The most romantic film themes
of all time
Henry Mancini’s “Moon
River”, from Breakfast at
Tiffany’s (1961)
There are three versions of this
song in the film adaptation of
Truman Capote’s acclaimed novel:
a choral version, an instrumental
version, and one performed during
the film by the amazing Audrey
Hepburn on her guitar during the
film. All three are dreamy and full
of hope, perfectly illustrating Holly
Golightly’s spirit.
Michel Legrand’s
“Les Parapluies de
Cherbourg”, from Les
Parapluies de Cherbourg
(1964)
The touching music of Michel
Legrand is more than a mere
companion for Jacques Demy’s
film, considering the fact that in
the whole film there is not even
one word of spoken dialogue;
all dialogues are sung on top of
Legrand’s compositions,which were
also responsible for establishing his
talent in Hollywood.
Nino Rota’s “Love
Theme”, from Romeo
and Juliet (1968)
In quite possibly the best film
adaptation of the most famous love
story of all time,Nino Rota achieves
a masterpiece, full of drama, along
with the a perfect medieval tone
that perfectly suits the setting of the
story.
Ennio Morricone’s “Tema
d’Amore”, from Cinema
Paradiso (1988)
The Maestro’s music was essential
in making Giuseppe Tornatore’s
Cinema Paradiso the classic film
masterpiece it is today. This track
perfectly captures Toto’s young, all-
consuming love for Elena, with the
necessary shades of melancholy and
nostalgia that perfectly complement
their story.
