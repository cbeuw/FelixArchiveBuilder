FILM
T
here are many ways a
movie can go about
breaking the fourth wall:
direct communication
with the audience can come in the
form of subtle wink-wink moments
of dialogue, such as Kingsman: The
Secret Service’s conversations about
classic spy films; the perfectly-
timed stare at the camera that
Eddie Murphy mastered in Trading
Places; references to real-world
events and people such as Riggan
Thomson’s hilarious Jeremy Renner
spiel in Birdman; or even just plain
old narration. The Big Short is a
film that takes all these methods,
bundles them up into a great big
fist, shatters the wall with a single
punch, and grabs the viewer by their
ears, screaming: “HEY. LISTEN.
WE’RE TRYING TO TELL
YOU SOMETHING.”
What it’s trying to tell you, on
the surface at least, is the story of a
bunch of outsiders who foresaw the
collapse of the worldwide housing
market and did what they could to
profit from it – centred particularly
around hedge fund managers Dr.
Michael Burry (Christian Bale) and
Mark Baum (Steve Carrell), and
Wall Street trader Jared Vennett
(Ryan Gosling). But as the movie
unfolds it becomes clear that
what it’s really trying to tell you is
something much more serious, and
much more important; something
you already know, but have never
wanted to.
The multi-character perspective
from which the film’s story is told
allows us to interact with the real
people who were tied up in the
insanely nebulous market crash
– we come face to face with the
villains and victims of the event.
Director and screenwriter Adam
McKay’s previous films have never
been afraid of poking a hefty dose of
fun at modern society – the absurd
nationalism displayed by overly-
proud Americans was taken to the
tenth power in Talladega Nights,and
the nature of over-saturation of air-
headed news networks was subtly
explored in the Anchorman films
– but the comedy in this film sits
squarely in the back seat.
The film’s breaking of the fourth
wall becomes painfully astute;
it reminds us that the crisis was
caused by a small number of
bankers so desperate to make even
more money that they were willing
to gamble with the livelihoods of
the general population. But more
worryingly, it tells us that if more
people had simply looked harder at
the ugly truth, perhaps the whole
mess could have been avoided. As
the film reaches its conclusion, we
realise with a heavy heart that we
already know exactly how it ends,
and that rather than creating some
kind of propaganda piece in hopes
of inciting a rebellion against ‘the
system, maaan,’all the film has done
is present us with the facts. The
marketing tagline chosen for the
film is a perfect pick, and develops
a whole new meaning after leaving
the theatre: “This is a true story”.
It speaks volumes of the McKay’s
talent that The Big Short makes its
desperate subject matter not only
arresting, but also hilarious, and
never uninteresting to watch. An
excellent effort from the production
team results in a slick, perfectly
stylised viewing experience; the tiny
details that make all the difference
fly by in a blink-and-you-miss-
it fashion – seconds-long shots
of pictures of our protagonists’
children on their desks are not
followed by scenes of the characters’
good parenting techniques, but
rather even quicker shots of those
same children at home tapping
away on MacBooks, implies they’re
indifferent to whether their fathers
care about them or not. The story’s
most important moments ring loud
and clear, but never feel forced or
over-the-top.
On top of the dramatic heft the
true story packs, McKay manages
to squeeze even more sympathy out
of the audience with a set of vivid,
oddball characters who bring the
screen to life – although perhaps the
real reasons behind the audience’s
sympathy for these characters is the
strength of the performances. Bale

The Big
Short is
technically
almost
flawless,
written with
cutting wit
All’s fair in love and finance
Esoteric economics are brought down to earth in Adam McKay’s hugely enjoyable film
happens to be the one raking in
award nominations for his portrayal
of Asperger’s-suffering economic
visionary Dr.Burry,and his carefully
selected opus of mannerisms (not
to mention his skills on a drum-
kit) are deployed to fantastic effect,
but in truth there is not a bad
performance in this movie. Special
recognition should go to everyone,
including each member of Baum’s
team (Rafe Spall,Jeremy Strong and
Hamish Linklater), as well as John
Magaro and Finn Wittrock, who
portray Charlie Geller and Jamie
Shipley respectively, two young
hedge fund upstarts who cross paths
with Vennett and get ahead on the
market’s collapse.
But if that recognition can only
go to a few, it is fully deserved by
the leads – Ryan Gosling has never
been so convincing as Vennett,
with a sliminess and a smoothness
that makes for a bafflingly effective
combination, and Steve Carell’s
turn as the perpetually on-edge and
deeply pained Baum continues the
expansion of his now incredibly
diverse acting range. Any of the
three would be worthy of the
nominations in my mind, but the
fact that Bale’s equally excellent
performance is the one receiving
them will certainly not have me
losing sleep.
The Big Short is a film that may
be difficult to think about after
watching, since its subject matter
only reveals its true importance
upon reflection. But the fact
remains that it is technically almost
flawless, written with cutting-edge
wit, excellently directed and acted,
and ultimately truly essential.
Documentary corner: American Movie
Ben Collier
Film Writer
I
t’s not often you see a
documentary split opinion
in such a love-it-or-hate-
it fashion. I suppose that is
something that comes with ‘cult
film’ territory, and personally,
when I think of the label of ‘cult
classic’, American Movie is the
first film that comes to mind. The
star here is Mark Borchardt – an
amateur filmmaker who has spent
his whole life trying to inspire his
family and slacker friends to fund,
star in, and help produce a short
horror film ‘Coven’. He does this in
order to garner interest and money,
eventually allowing him to produce
his magnum opus ‘Northwestern’.
Mark’s charm manifests itself in
his unwavering enthusiasm in the
face of ridiculous odds; What one
comes to realise is that everybody
but Mark – and his best friend/
side-kick Mark Schank – knows
that Coven is doomed. We see
scene-after-scene of failed shoots,
horrific acting based on a woeful
script, topped off by laughable
special effects. If you look up the
infamously hilarious scene of Mark’s
attempts to direct his bored and
grumpy Uncle Bill (the unwilling
main financier of the project) to
say just one line “It’s alright, it’s ok!
There’s something to live for! Jesus
told me so!” you’ll get the idea.
But, of course, complexity is
present beyond the can’t-look-
away car crash humour. What is
so uniquely brilliant about this
film is how hilarious it can be
whilst simultaneously maintaining
a serious and quite depressing
undertone.
This, I feel, warrants some
explanation. The difficulty here
is that describing this movie
accurately is near-impossible due
to it simply being that bizarrely
dichotomous in its feel. Some
examples may give a rough idea
though. One line that stands out is
when, following an endless string
of laboured takes, Mark shouts to
Uncle Bill “you have to believe in
what you’re saying!” to which Bill
bitterly replies “Well, I don’t; I don’t
believe in nothing you’re doing.”
The pessimism shown by Uncle Bill
throughout really contrasts and cuts
through the child-like enthusiasm
of Mark, helping us to see past his
fantasy world and understand the
reality of his life. Both Mark and
Mike grew up in a very working
class area of Milwaukee and
both experienced quite desolate
upbringings; both face a number of
demons. A burgeoning alcoholism
is evident in the film, and Mark’s
issues with both gambling and a
deeply dysfunctional family are also
explored later on. Mike, at several
points, explains that the only thing
for friends to do for fun in his city
is slack off and drink can-after-can
of shit beer.
I consider American Movie to be
one of the best documentary films
ever made, and would happily
place it very high up on a list of
my favourite movies. What it
presents to the viewer is a uniquely
unpolished, warts-and-all look into
the lives of people attempting to
do away with their label of “trailer
park white trash,” achieve success in
Hollywood, and live the American
Dream.

I
tried to like The Assassin. I
really, really did try. First
hearing about it during its
rapturous reception in Cannes,
where Hou Hsiao-Hsien became
the second Taiwanese director in the
festival’s history to win the coveted
Best Director Award,I watched as it
made its way towards a UK release,
pushed along by wave after wave
of ecstatic reviews. After seeing it
at the London Film Festival I was
left disappointed; the glacial pace
of the film meant there were many
points where I drifted off. But then
a few months later, The Assassin was
named Sight and Sound’s best film
of 2015. I must have been overtired,
I rationalised to myself; I ought
to give it another shot, and really
focus this time, to try and catch
what I had missed. Well, call me a
philistine, but I really didn’t get it –
Hsiao-Hsien has indeed created a
thing of beauty, a work of art in the
most aesthetic sense of the word,
but his insistence of keeping the
audience removed from the work
results in a feeling of tedium and
overwhelming isolation.
Set in 8th
Century China, The
Assassin’s premise is that a young
woman from the province of
Weibo was given away to a nun at
a young age, who trained her up to
become a master of the sword, and
a lethal assassin. After fobbing an
assignment, she is returned home,
under strict instruction to kill her
cousin, to whom she was once
betrothed. This is all explained in
the first five minutes of the film, a
stunning black and white tableau of
nature and violence; to say that the
plot only thickens from there is an
understatement. A political rivalry
between Weibo and the Imperial
Court, along with a revolving cast
of characters, whose presence is
unexplained or justified, means that
often we are swimming in a sea of
confusion without the lifejacket of
context. While a second viewing
revealed more of the plot, the entire
set-up was so impenetrable that at
some points I felt it would be more
worthwhile to ignore the subtitles
on the screen, and just let the poetic
visuals wash over me.
And what visuals these are.
Hsiao-Hsien is a master behind
the camera, constructing intricate
interior scenes, where billowing
silk obfuscates the view of the
lens, which contrast with the vast
dramatic landscapes of rural China.
Cinematographer Mark Lee Ping
Bin, of In the Mood for Love fame,
gracefully handles the interplay
of light within the film, providing
Hsiao-Hsien with a ravishing colour
palette from which to construct this
visual tone-poem.
But while the style is there, a
sense of substance isn’t – or at
least, it’s so deeply buried within
the labyrinthine plot as to make
it invisible. While Ang Lee’s
Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon
may have elevated wuxia films to
high-art, making them appealing
to Western viewers, The Assassin
tries to take things to another level;
however, the high-intensity nature
of wuxia and the laconic character
of the film are uneasy bedfellows.
Ultimately, The Assassin reminded
me so much of the pots produced
during the Tang Dynasty in which
the film is set: stunning to look
at, with a glossy surface of gilded
colour, but hollow on the inside.
