tudents at the school have
started a ‘Free Speech
Society’ due to what they
call the “growing sense of
censorship” on campus.
The group say they’re tired of
their university’s reputation, given
that so far this academic year the
sale of The Sun has been stopped
in its shop, the rugby club has
been disbanded for a year after it
distributed sexist and homophobic
leaflets, and trigger warnings were
put up around a Palestinian Society
Business school still 4th
best in UK says FT
Imperial’s full time MBA slipped one place internationally, making it 35th

mperial College Business
School’s full-time MBA
program is the 35th
best in
the world and the fourth best
in the UK according to the 2016
Financial Times MBA rankings
released this week.
The list, which is published
annually, ranks business schools
based on the average weighted
salary of students, employment
after three months, salary increase
(the increase in alumnus salary from
before the MBA to now), and a
number of other factors.
The latest weighted average salary,
which makes adjustments based
on variations between sectors, of
Imperial College Business School
graduates after three years was
£78,400, an increase of around
£2600 from last year.
The business school is considered
at “the forefront of MBA teaching
for a digital era” according to the
Financial Times, referencing the
recent £20 million funding for
the KPMG Centre for Advanced
Business Analytics. The KPMG
Data Observatory, a 313 degree
visualisation tool which launched
in November, forms part of this
investment.
Dr. Gawer, Associate Professor
in Strategy and Innovation at
the business school said, on the
importance of digital business,
that: “The fusion of business and
technology is at the heart of where
the economy is going. I think our
MBA participants understand that.”

mean?
Safe space
A ‘safe space’ policy is
something most student
unions have, and promise
to keep members and staff
happy and protected. Imperial
SU’s own policy includes
measures to combat sexual
harassment, violence, abuse and
discrimination, citing ‘blackface’
as one example of unacceptably
offensive behaviour.
While most of these policies
are broadly similar, some unions
citetheirpolicymorethanothers,
leading to the phrase becoming
synonymous with, depending on
your view, political correctness
gone wrong, or the right to
comfort and safety during your
time at uni.
No-platform
This is when someone decides
that a speaker’s views are so
offensive that the platform is
going to be removed, ie their
talk cancelled. Most universities,
notably the NUS, have policies
on this, which list certain groups
that unions should not give
a platform like the BNP and
EDL. These groups are usually
openly racist or fascist.
protest.
The group’s founders argue that
universities “should prepare us for
the real world instead of putting us
in the safe-space bubble”. Although
there are often debates as part
of the union, chaired by elected
officers, the founders of ‘Speakeasy’
believe that the standard student
isn’t being treated like an adult, and
claim debates on sensitive topics are
being “shut down” for fear of being
offensive.
They say they want to create
a climate that welcomes debate,
instead of censoring discussion out
of fear of offending. One founding
member argued that there is
confusion between debating a point
and agreeing with it, saying that
some students feel there is a “veil of
hypocrisy” while students “pretend
they agree so as not to disrupt the
safe space”.
The club’s page on the LSE’s
student union website says its
aims are to campaign against no-
platforming and censorship, invite
speakers, and protect free speech on
campus.
LSE’s newest club recently got
profiled by The Independent – quite
a coup for a club who hasn’t actually
had a real life meeting yet.
One of the founding members is
the son of The Sun’s former foreign
correspondent, Nick Parker, who in
2014 was charged with handling
an MP’s stolen phone, but cleared
of aiding abetting misconduct in a
public office. Charlie Parker is in his
second year of a Philosophy degree.
Here, the argument seems to
be that the feelings of what these
students feel are only the few should
not be overshadowed by what they
feel is a “ban culture” at LSE.
The university, ranked fourth
in the world for Economics, is
somewhat notorious for its left wing
vibe and political activity, renamed
the student union president post
‘general secretary’ in the 80s in
solidarity with striking miners.
