An idiot’s guide to the US Election
Primary? Caucus? Superdelegate? What does it all mean?
Matt Johnston

T
he United States
Presidential election.
The $6 billion race
for the White House.
The battle between Democrats
and Republicans, Donkeys versus
Elephants. Like an Olympics for
politicians, it happens every four
years and has the potential to shape
world economics and policy until
the next one.
But what on earth is
happening?
February 1st
marks the start of
the Presidential nomination race,
specifically the Iowa Caucus, with it
being the first time the public can
voice their opinions. This process
will contribute to the eventual
decision on which candidates are
picked to represent the Republicans
and Democrats in the November
presidential election.
Republican frontrunners include
Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Ben
Carson, Jeb Bush and the man
of the moment, Donald J Trump.
They are in competition against
the Democrat candidates, Hillary
Clinton, Bernie Sanders and, to a
lesser extent, Martin O’Malley.
But what is a caucus I hear you
scream, and is it the same thing as a
primary? Well scream no more.
Caucuses and primaries are
indeed different things but they
largely serve the same purpose, to
decide the makeup of delegates who
vote for each party’s presidential
election candidate at the National
Convention in July. Each state, as
well as a selection of other territories
(notably American Samoa, District
of Colombia, Guam and Puerto
Rico) each get either a primary or
a caucus from which the makeup of
delegates is decided.
Who gets delegates?
How many delegates a certain
region gets is dependant on a
crazy and confusing system of
rules and regulations, which change
depending on the party. Several
rules that the Republican party uses
include choosing delegates based
on the number of representatives
that the state has in the House and
Senate, and whether the state voted
for the Republican candidate at the
last election.
The Democrats, however, take
into consideration the previous
election voting in comparison to the
wider nation, as well as the electoral
college votes that each state has
(a crude way of incorporating
population). Bonus delegates are
also assigned for a multitude of
reasons, ranging from when you
hold the primary/caucus to if your
neighbouring states also hold theirs
on the same date in a process known
as “clustering”.
(Fun fact: Hawaii and Alaska
are classed as neighbours of
Washington and Oregon for this.)
Essentially all the relevant, and
seemingly irrelevant, data is fed
into the system, the alignment of
the planets is checked and if the
groundhog sees his shadow then
you’ve somehow got yourself some
delegates.
So how are these
delegates chosen?
Well, some aren’t for a start.
These delegates are referred to as
unpledged or are given the snazzy
title of ‘Superdelegate’ and are free
to choose who they like out of the
candidates. At the Democratic
conference there are around 700
of these Superdelegates, making
up roughly 15% of the total vote
and comprising of high ranking
party members as well as former
Presidents and Vice Presidents.
The Republicans select far fewer,
around 168, which equates to
around 5% of their vote and these
are drawn from three senior party
members from each of the regions
who have a vote.
Superdelegates can sway the
overall vote, as well as the larger
public opinion, and are seen from
opposing sides as either a steady
hand to guide the nomination
process or an encroachment into
an otherwise purely democratic
selection.
But what about the remainder
of delegates? That’s where the
primaries and caucuses come in.
Primaries
Primaries are similar to any other
election and a secret ballot is held in
which delegates are selected based

on these results. The complications
arise when a primary is either open
or closed as this affects who can
vote. Usually in a closed primary
only voters who are registered with
that party can vote, but some states
do allow independent voters to cast
their vote too.
In contrast, an open primary
means that a registered voter may
vote in either party’s primary but
only in one (i.e. a Republican
voter may vote for the Democratic
nomination but not the Republican
nomination too). Open primaries
have been criticised for allowing
a certain extent of vote rigging to
occur, as one side may vote to get
a weaker opposition candidate in
order to stand a better chance in the
final, presidential election.
Primaries of one form or another
take place in all regions bar ten
(Alaska, Colorado, Hawaii, Kansas,
Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, North
Dakota, Wyoming and Iowa) and
the remainder have the mystical
caucuses.
Caucuses
Voting at caucuses is conducted
at a large number of small meetings
across the state in question, with the
results from all these combined and
then distributed to the delegates.
The way in which these are
conducted again vary by both state
and party but the general format is
a period of debate and discussion,
followed by a vote.These can be both
open and closed like the primaries,
and mostly follow the same rules.
Some states have systems in which
the voting is done via a secret ballot
and some via physically moving into
groups of voters with a count being
taken. It’s all a bit of a mess as to
who does what.
But why have both?
It’s a case of different votes for
different folks and all that really.
Each have pros and cons as although
the caucuses usually allow decisions
to be made on wider issues aside
from the election, they take longer,
meaning only the more politically
engaged voters in the state turn up.
In the end all the votes from
the state get tallied up, and the
delegates are given out either in a
proportional or in a winner-takes-
all fashion, depending on the party,
state and what time of year it is
(genuinely).
Well what’s so special
about Iowa then?
The Iowa Caucus is the top dog
when it comes to caucuses and this
largely boils down to the fact that
it is first. It gained it’s frontrunner
position in 1972 due to hotel rooms
(don’t ask) and tradition/state law
means it has now become the first
event of the nomination calendar.
This means that it has great
influence on the trajectory of the
whole campaign as it is gives a first
indication to see who voters are
favouring.This can change campaign
strategies wildly in some cases, and
can even cause participants who fair
terribly to drop out all together.
Results from Iowa have also been
known to cause a snowballing effect
in which endorsements and visibility
is garnered for candidates who were
seemingly unnoticed beforehand.
The whole Iowa circus tends to
propagate its own existence too, as
where the media are, the candidates
usually aren’t too far behind and vice
versa.This has lead to the seemingly
innocuous state being national and
international news for a brief period
every four years.
Come on then, will Trump
actually be our overlord?
Maybe, possibly, who knows. All
that is certain is that he stands a
decent chance of becoming the
nomination for the Republican
party at least. This is largely in part
to the plethora of different rules
that could fall in Donald’s favour
(such as the cross party voting by
Democrats to bolster their chances).
A big indication will come this
Monday as to his, and indeed
the candidates from both party’s
chances, but there’s over 280 days
and a lot of voting before it’s all over.
