Making a Murderer

Cartoon Corner: Rick & Morty
S
ometimes considered a loose
and boisterous reimaging
of Doc Brown and Marty,
Rick and Morty is a fun
and wild, animated science-fiction
show where things are anything but
classic Sci-Fi.If you haven’t heard of
this show by now, you’ve either been
subjugated by the rule of the canines
or are trapped in a minverse,inside a
miniverse, inside a miniverse inside
your car battery.
The show’s creator is Dan
Harmon, also well known for
being the guy behind the comedy
show Community. As any fans
of Community can tell you, Dan
Harmon is know for not following
the classic tropes you see on most
media. His style is his own unique
thing, doing away with typical
clichés entirely or portraying them
with a different spin.
Rick and Morty is no exception
with the show either parodying
several sci-fi tropes and/or taking
them in wild and over-the-top
directions.The payoff is a bizarre but
highly entertaining and humorous
set of episodes that’ll have you
craving the next installment. For
example, in an inception-style
episode, our main characters enter
a dream, within a dream, within a
dream,for the purpose of convincing
Morty’s math teacher to give him
better grades.
The series features Rick, an
old, outlandish and alcoholic
scientist, and his gullible grandson
Morty, who go on various crazy
and dangerous adventures across
alternate universes and different
a lonely, troubled, haunted past.
The viewer is also exposed to a less
nuanced part of his personality – a
real and deep concern for his family.
Meanwhile, we see Morty grow and
evolve, becoming more confident,
taking initiative and standing up to
Rick now and again.
Besides these two,other characters
with their own traits feature, each
bringing something new to the
table. The most prominent of them
is the rest of Rick and Morty’s
dysfunctional family. These include
his parents Beth, Morty’s assertive,
level-headed and dissatisfied
mother,and Jerry,his insecure father
who severely disapproves of Rick.
Morty’s older sister Summer
also graces the screen more as the
show progresses, with her being
conventional, superficial and
somewhat jealous of Morty having
all the fun. These characters get
increasingly involved in different
and interesting ways as the show
goes along, though sometimes the
subplots leave much to be desired.
Seeing Rick have a go at Jerry never
loses its charm. The characters are
written so well that the viewers
even care for characters who show
sectors of space.
The major crux of the show is
the interplay between Rick and
Morty, which never gets old. Rick
is depicted as a genius scientist,
full of witty one-liners, preferring
to live free and party hard, always
considering himself superior to
others. Morty, in contrast, is good-
natured but easily distressed and is
frequently shown to be reluctant and
disapproving of his grandfather’s
methods resulting in several causes
of friction and drama between the
two.
The characters may seem a little
one-dimensional at first, but as
the series progresses, we gain more
insight into the development and
layers of our protagonists. For
example, behind Rick’s brash,
arrogant and lively exterior, there’s
weird or out-of-place, instead
always cooming naturally.
An example of a more softcore
incident is when Morty gets tired of
all the crazy stuff he’s put through
and goes full on berserk mode, à la
the purge.
This clever and inventive show
is the epitome of high-concept
storytelling, with a healthy dose
of hilarity and poignant character
moments mixed in now and
again for sustained emotional and
punch. Many of these episodes are
standalone, though there is a greater
focus on continuity as the show
evolves.
However, this is nothing too
taxing and the creators know just
how much to lean on it so that future
developments carry more weight.At
times, Rick and Morty becomes its
own worst enemy,becoming slightly
less innovative and repeating old
storylines. However, even these
episodes are written wonderfully,
and if they’re the worst the show has
to offer, it speaks volumes about the
overall quality.
For a show that was initially an
adults-only Back to the Future
parody, Rick and Morty has now
become something much more
special. With the successful formula
of merging high-concept sci-fi
storytelling with biting humour
and a dash of emotionally complex
character development, this show
is always a blast to watch, and I
highly recommend it if you haven’t
watched it yet.
And that’s the waaaayyy we go!!
Rick and Morty is available on
Adult Swim
up only a couple of times like bird
person (P.S. F*** Tammy).
Amidst these mad hijinks,
the show has some dark and
uncomfortable moments in which
Rick and Morty are put through
pretty extreme stuff. While a little
disconcerting to watch, these
moments help shape our characters
when moving forward. It is also a
sign of the greatness of the show-
moments such as these never seem

M
aking a Murderer,
released to stream on
Netflix in December
2015, is Netflix’s
second foray into documentary
filmmaking after the mostly ignored
Chef’s Table. It has already been
described by many as the service’s
most addictive program yet.
The series follows the story
of Steven Avery, a resident of
Manitowoc County, Wisconsin,
convicted of a crime he did not
commit, serving 18 years in prison
before being found innocent
through DNA exoneration. He
then decided to sue the county
sheriff’s department for $36 million
for the gross mishandling of his
case. However, before the case can
be settled, Avery is accused of the
murder of a woman named Teresa
Halbach, the trial of which makes
up to bulk of the series’ runtime.
What follows is an incredibly
harrowing look into police and
judicial corruption and misconduct.
There is evidence presented of
the police department, planting
evidence, coercing witnesses and
improperly handling the legal
proceedings of the case, among
other equally disturbing acts.
What is interesting about this
documentary is the depth to which
it investigates and presents the story.
Where one might usually expect
such a documentary to cover this
in around two hours, this series
has ten hours to provide lengthy
explanations for the evidence that
Avery’s defence presents, as well
as the prosecution’s explanations
(or lack thereof). However, as this
features events spanning from 1985
to 2014, focussing on a case that
itself had over 200 hours worth of
evidence presented, there are, of
course, omissions that one could
take issue with.
The series does suffer slightly
in that it undoubtedly has bias
simple adolescent antics, the reality
of which is much more disturbing.
He was arrested and jailed three
times prior to his false accusation,
for burglary of a local store, assault
of his cousin and, most shockingly,
for dousing his cat in gasoline and
setting it on fire. Omissions such as
these serve only to undermine the
purpose of the documentary which
should not be to paint Avery as a
saint,but to display the mishandling
and sabotaging of the case by
the Manitowoc Country Sheriff
Department.
I would, despite this, unreservedly
recommend watching the series,
if for no other reason than to join
in the cultural phenomenon it has
become.
Warning: The rest of this review
will contain spoilers.
In the short time since its release,
theshowhasreachedmemeticstatus,
with a change.org petition calling for
President Obama to release Steven
Avery reaching nearly 450,000
signatures, despite such an action
being outside of the President’s
jurisdiction. It has also inspired
many couch detectives giving their
theories on what really happened to
Teresa Halbach. People have been
blaming anyone from her brother
to her roommate, to the police
department themselves for her
murder. To make such unfounded
accusations goes against the very
purpose of the documentary, that it
is not okay to accuse someone of a
crime just because of your personal
feelings toward them.
Many members of the Manitowoc
Sheriff’s Department featured
in the show have had to release
statements providing their views
on the documentary, with most
dismissing it, claiming it skips huge
swathes of evidence that implicate
Avery in the murder.However,none
have responded to the claims of
evidence planting laid against them.
The documentary certainly came
at the right time. With so much
discussion all over the US on police
corruption and unfair treatment
of minorities, this is undoubtedly
a large contributing factor to its
success, and one that makes it hit so
close to home for so many people.
The most harrowing part of
the documentary is the interview
of Brendan Dassey, Avery’s
nephew. The video shows two
experienced detectives coercing
and manipulating a 16 year-old
into admitting to committing
various heinous actions on Halbach
including, but not limited to, rape,
torture and murder.
Throughout the interrogation it
is clear that Dassey does not fully
realise the consequences of what
he is saying, and is just saying
whatever he thinks the detectives
want to hear in order to go home.
The interrogation was eventually
deemed to be inadmissible in
court but not before the District
Attorneys describe in graphic detail
all that was said, diminishing both
Avery’s and Dassey’s chances to win
fair trials.
Making a Murderer is available on
Netflix
in Steven Avery’s favour. This
manifests mainly in downplaying
some of the darker parts of Avery’s
past, most egregiously dismissing
Avery’s criminal activity prior to
his false conviction for rape as
