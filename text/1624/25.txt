Rolling in the deep (space)

F
iendishly difficult games
have proven popular with
gamers in recent years.
Most of these games
require fast reactions and an
intimate understanding of each
level or enemy. Tharsis is as difficult
as games like Dark Souls and
Bloodborne and it should be. Your
spacecraft is on it’s way to Mars. It
has just been hit by a meteorite and
you’ve lost two members of your
crew. Your chances of survival are
infinitesimally small – you might
never beat this game because it’s all
down to luck.It’s emulating real life.
Most games hide their
randomness, the chance of a player’s
success in a given situation, beneath
layers of code. In RPG’s there’s a
small chance your attack will deliver
a ‘critical hit’ and in other games
different events will randomly
occur at any given time. So when
things aren’t in your favour, the
player often feels frustrated. Tharsis
is painfully hard, but by exposing
its randomness – in the form of
rolling dice – it removes part of the
frustration. Rather than resenting
the developers for building a ‘mean’
game, you start to curse your luck in

defeat.
Dice essentially act as an in-game
currency which you can spend
protecting your ship’s health, the
four members of your crew,and their
stress levels. Each turn (you must
complete ten before you arrive on
Mars) new problems appear on your
ship, ranging from fires to a blue
screen of death. Micromanagement
this choice, and your dice are from
that point onwards stained in blood
and that character’s total life is
permanently reduced by one.It’s the
game’s way of saying that a part of
your soul has just died.
Even when the dice aren’t red they
look astonishingly realistic and the
physics have been perfectly refined
(definitely turn your rumble on if
you’re playing with a controller) to
make every roll incredibly satisfying.
In general, the presentation of
Tharsis is sublime. Each module
of the ship is beautifully rendered
and the lighting gives a real sense
of emergency when all is about to
be lost. Planning out your strategy
each turn requires concentration
and the accompanying music
does a lot to mitigate the stress.
The chill electronica never grows
old, sounding like a subdued Tron
soundtrack.
Choice Provisions have developed
a great game, but I feel like its
difficulty might be off-putting for
many. In the playthrough where I
finally succeeded (it took about six
tries with each unsuccessful run
lasting from ten to 20 minutes),
every member of my crew ate
human flesh. Tharsis teaches that
sacrifice is necessary to achieve the
impossible; a sacrifice that many
might not choose to make.
Tharsis is out now on
Steam and PSN
Tharsis is a brutally hard space survival strategy game, with dice
is the key to success and the game
does a good job of teaching you
where your priorities should lie
after each successive death. One of
these is food – which is essential to
survival and replenishes your dice.
When you’re really low on dice and
you have no food, the game gives
you an unforgivable choice – do
you resort to cannibalism? Make
