This week you decide to run
in the Big Elections, sorry
the Really Quite Large
elections. No actually, we’ve
just had word they’re now
the Presidential Elections.
We mean Bellend Selections.
Oh wait, no, our fault, they’re
actually the Leadership
Elections.

You apply to every position
in the elections. Genius! No
one’s ever done that before.
God you’re so hilarious. Ha
ha ha.
This week you are a RIGHT
wingin’, BITTER clinging,
PROOOOOOUD clingers
of.... ourgunsourgod OUR....
and our religion! You decide
to endorse Donald Trump
because you’re mad and
you’ve been had.
This week, unable to find
any news for your weekly
newspaper, you make the
whole thing up. Every word.
Even the horoscopes. Will
anyone notice? Or will they
just assume every article is a
finely crafted piece of well-
researched truth? Is it?
This week, you start raiding
‘Imperial Memes’ for ‘Secrets
of Imperial’ shit to post. This
works quite well, because
no one on Secrets even
remembers memes, they
were too busy doing their
A-Levels.This is quite a good
idea actually.
This week, you try and
impress girls from American
universities at the union by
referring to FELIX’s guide
to American politics on page
13. It’s all going well until
she’s sees the article coming
out of your pocket. I love
that guy, she says, pointing at
Trump. Ah well, nearly.
This week, your hook up your
new virtual reality headset
to Panopto, making your the
most powerful dork at the
whole of Imperial. However,
drunk on power, you moon
the lecture theatre, but as
you watch lectures from the
M&M store now, you get a
life ban.
This week, you change your
name by deed poll to Google
in the hope that you can fool
HMRC into only having to
pay 3% income tax. Googling
yourself will never be the
same again.
This week you read the entire
green paper. All 105 pages!
Damn, you must really love
higher education. You’re
disappointed at the ending
though; it wasn’t about weed
at all. BORING.
This week, your comment
under a Secrets of Imperial
post gets 20 likes. Shut the
front door. You call your
mum, explaining she doesn’t
need to worry about the
mortgage anymore because
you’ve made it now.Congrats.
This week you’re every sports
club at Imperial. Tired of
your own antics, you realise
that nothing you ever do will
get you into the Daily Mail
again. Those Warwick rowers
get in every year with their
naked charity calendar. Grrr.
This week you are a famous
rapper called Bob. Your
tweet about the Earth being
flat makes international
headlines. Where is the
curve? Have you been to the
edge? Once you go flat, you
never go back.
