FRIDAY 29th
JANUARY 2016

L
ast Saturday, Imperial
College Boat Club’s
annual party ended early
when students were
chucked out for bad behaviour.
In an email seen by FELIX sent
from the venue’s management after
the event, the students are accused
of throwing food at members of
staff, vomiting in corridors and
staircases “around the hotel”, with
one particular student accused of
“vomiting all over [the] manager
when he was explaining to you
that the function was going to be
stopped due to the behaviour”.
The party was held at the swanky
Ambassador’s Hotel in Bloomsbury.
In the email, the management told
the boat club that they were now
banned from any future events at
the hotel.
Early in the evening, managers
warned students that if their
behaviour did not improve they
would be ejected from the venue.
The hotel accuses students of
damaging equipment, bringing
alcohol and consuming it in the
hotel which is not allowed, and
leaving bar bills unpaid. At 10pm,
two hours earlier than planned, the
hotel management turned on the
lights and threw the students out.
The students are also accused of
smashing the glass wall of a toilet
cubicle in the hotel, which it is now
seeking compensation for, as well as
extra cleaning costs.
The club were also told in the
subsequent email that the hotel’s

“businessrelationship”withImperial
College may now be in danger, and
that college would be informed of
the matter “to make them aware of
the behaviour of their students”.
The club has now been temporarily
suspended by the union.
This comes just one week after the
medics boat clubbed were stopped
at Dover on their annual trip to
Belgium for being too drunk. Some
had port bottles taped to their arms
as P&O ferries decided to deny
them passage due to being “drunk
and disorderly”.
Regarding the non-medic boat
club’s recent antics, the union told
FELIX: “Following the alleged
incidents of Saturday 23rd
January,
the club have been immediately
suspended pending investigation.

They are cooperating to establish
