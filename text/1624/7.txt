Masters of self-sabotage
Our mentality towards mental health needs to change if we are to reduce suffering

of pure, unadulterated human
arrogance that has led us to
the self-sabotage that I make
reference to in the title.
Humans have successfully
institutionalised suffering. Whether
that be through the failure of our
democratically-elected leaders or
the failure of a society so repelled
by the idea of change that creating
and propagating our own suffering
has become as natural to us as the
happiness we all crave.
When I think about this, I think
about the millions of LGBT youth
across the world, struggling to deal
with who they are, and who they
love, all while in the midst of a
world so ferociously hostile towards
them. To be so unapologetically
cruel to these kids is to play with
ﬁre. Subjecting them to further
mental stress is to tempt fate, and
We are the
victims of
our own
delusions of
grandeur

and to find

it is my belief that fate will oblige,
should it be tempted so.
Blood stains are what we are left
with when we are so torturous to
those who are so innocent,especially
when it comes to those struggling
with their sexuality.
With this in mind, it is important
to remember humans are a self-
destructive species, and the tendrils
of this self-destruction are far-
reaching. When we so brazenly
elevate our achievements and
conﬂate our intelligence with
untouchability, it is no wonder
that we are the victims of our own
delusions of grandeur.
So little is known about the brain,
so to me, it is sadly poetic that it is
subject to such underestimation.The
same brain which has built a fully-
functioning, orbiting space station
has also justiﬁed the slaughter of
gay men by throwing them from
atop buildings in towns in Syria. It
is obvious that its capabilities are all
at once amazing, and terrifying.
We have all experienced the
joy of a society which utilises the
strengths of our collective intellect.
It is, therefore, a mystery to me
to see a society stigmatise mental
health so viciously. We are as much
at the mercy of our minds as we are
the masters of it. To so easily cast
mental illnesses into the shadows
is both arrogant and extremely
dangerous.
That being said, it is somewhat
understandable for there to be a
lack of engagement with mental
health. It is easier to sympathise
with someone who has a broken
leg than a broken soul. But to be so
callous as to force the people around
us into a veritable state of hiding is
morally reprehensible. One in four
people in the UK will experience a
mental health problem each year, so
it seems the shadows are ﬁlled with
suffering souls.
I believe mental illnesses are tied
to an intangible vulnerability that
people fear so deeply.There is such a
desperation for every single one of us
to be the absolute best of ourselves,
to be successful and to achieve, and
to fulﬁl our potential, God-given
or otherwise. There is such a thirst
to be ‘happy’ and to ﬁnd ‘happiness’
and I think, all things considered,
our desires are misplaced. We are
so concerned with ﬁnding our own
perfection that we forget to be
human.These attitudes fuel our own
prejudice towards mental illnesses.
However, I think bigotry and
prejudice are more of the heart,
than of the mind. To overcome our
prejudices we must put our hearts
ﬁrst.
To approach issues in this way can
be so rewarding and so pivotal in
shaping the views of a wider society.
Whether that be a Priest who
speaks out in support of same-sex
marriage, or a mother who accepts
her son’s sexuality as part of who he
is, by using our hearts we can create
a more positive environment for the
most vulnerable amongst us.
I have made a conscious focus on
LGBT youth in this article because
it is of personal importance to me,
but my message can be applied
to anyone and everyone. While
education and more comprehensive
mental healthcare will go a long
way in helping those who suffer so
needlessly, on an individual level
we must all do more to help those
around us, and we must lead with
our hearts in doing so.
It is because our brains are so
brilliant that we should be vigilant
and supportive should things go
wrong. Vulnerability should be
embraced, our ﬂaws should be
embraced, and ultimately our
weaknesses should be embraced.
Only then can our own mental
health be seen as health just as a
broken leg or a stomach bug.
Our minds are as fragile as they
are wonderful, and there is a ﬁne
line that separates us from that
fragility.
I think, in the end, we are all lost.
But it is better to be lost with the
ones we love than to be lost alone.
