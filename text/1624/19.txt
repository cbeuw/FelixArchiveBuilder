F
resh outta West Basement,
this comedy virgin headed
out to meet Knock2Bag.
Hailed by Time Out as
some of the best comedy in the East
End at brilliant value, it had a lot to
live up to.
On the menu this month – a four
course slap up of sexuality, served up
light with a little Irish on the side.
Each set follows a strict fifteen-
a thousand heartbeats too long.
The headline performance by Sam
Simmons, was undeniably dire -
surprising coming from the winner
of this year’s Foster’s Comedy
award. Watching him on stage is
like seeing a walrus in headlights.
You can smell the fat frying.
Worse – and maybe, maybe,
it’s just that moustache (and the
suspenders) but there’s something
downright creepy about his act.
It’s more than a hint of voyeuristic
shopkeeper – stacking up cans of
cheap lines without the courage to
do anything more than grope at his
audience.
I should have taken the fact that
Jessie Cave (that’s Lavender Brown
to you, IC) had pulled out last
minute as a sign. Like that point in
a crap date where you pay your half
of the bill and suddenly remember
that your house burning down.
Fortunately, Knock2Bag had Mae
Martin to prove me absolutely and
completely wrong. I’ll admit there’s
a chink in my stone critics heart
for a girl who can stand on stage
and laugh about her sexuality. The
beautiful thing here is that this is

part of the act,but it doesn’t define it.
We don’t just get‘gay’Mae.Whether
it’s that dick joke about her brother
and her dad – or her willingness to
talk about her last boyfriend,this
act is remarkable for it’s openness.
There are definite influences of that
undefeatable ‘gay’ gallows humour
(see Eighty-Sixed by Feinberg for
a rough taste). However, the really
fantastic thing is that it doesn’t
matter where you are on the debate,
you’ll laugh all the same. At basics,
Martin says – the world is just too
crazy to take seriously. Who could
disagree with that?
Other notable performances
included Spencer Jones,as a rougher
kind of Mr. Bean. It’s blunt physical
comedy. In the format of a fifteen
minute piece though, there just isn’t
enough build an explosive, funny
ending that’s believable.
Overall, for the price – £8 online
(£12 on the door) – the value is very
decent. Just come prepared for a few
nose dives along the way.

than a full on strip, but as a means
of getting newer comics involved, it
works.

Subterranean arts festival promises to surprise

H
ave you ever wondered
what goes on
underneath London’s
famous “graffiti tunnel”
that is Leake Street, near Waterloo
station?
Halfway down the tunnel is
the entrance to The Vaults, a
subterranean labyrinth of creative
space and entertainment. For the
third year running, the venue will
be home to the Vault Festival, a
six-week event jam-packed with
exciting shows and workshops –
London’s cousin to the Edinburgh
Fringe. Built on the philosophy of
“reinventingthenon-fundedcreative
sector”, the line up is refreshing
and promises to surprise with the
unexpected and experimental.
On Wednesdays to Sundays every
week between the 27th
of January to
the 6th
March, the Vault Festival will
host more than a hundred theatre,
cabaret and comedy performances.
Here is a selection of FELIX Arts’
top picks.
Vault Surge
Throughout the festival
Vault Surge is an in-house
programme of workshops,
discussions and shows (mostly free)
running throughout the festival.
Designed to encourage conversation
in the arts, these include artist
surgeries, new acts performed in
the restaurant within, as well as
Femme Fierce – UK’s largest all
female street art and graffiti festival.
Not to mention the Vault Fundays,

which include activities like “speed-
gaming” – speed dating for gamers!

In this immersive performance
theatre, you are cast as Banquo
from Macbeth in a story tracing
his journey from the battlefield
to banquet table. With the help
of headphones, video projections
and live performance, the show
focuses on the effects of war on men
returning home from battle and the
bond between soldiers.
Tar Baby
10th
–14th

out of racism”, this solo theatrical

minority experiences on the other
side of the Atlantic.
The show won a Fringe First

in 2015.
Clowning workshops

The festival feature two clowning
workshops, with a “hysterical” one,
'The Art of Hysteria', celebrating
the new play Hysterical, and another
one by the Fringe First nominated

be a mix of solo improvisation and
collaborative games. Why not take
a break from work and learn a new
skill (and maybe cheer your friends
up)?
The Forest
24th
Feb – 6th
Mar, £16
This hour-long experience is an
immersive, multi-sensory test that
claims to “revolutionise the way you
process data” and “give an insight
into the functionality of your brain”.
Is your brain a computer chip that
can be debugged? Yeah, I’m curious
to find out what that means, too.
The ancient art of being illustrated

S
kin as a blank canvas is not a
new idea; Ötzi the Iceman,
frozen sometime between
3239 and 3105 BCE had
a tattoo. Inking or marking skin
unites cultures and continents
across the ages.
Until recently in the West,
tattoos have been seen as a mark of
belonging to a counterculture. They
are so subversive that in 1995 The
New York Times art critic Michael
Kimmelman likened tattoos to the
‘art of the insane’.
However, now one in three
adults in Britain has a tattoo.
Even in ubiquity, tattoos remain
controversial; a quick poll in the
FELIX office revealed tattoos to
be variously ‘hot’ , akin to ‘gangrene’
to ‘putting people at risk of missing
a dermatological condition’. No
prizes for guessing the latter was the
opinion of a medical student.
Tattoos when inked well and well
placed (collarbones are a personal
favourite) can be beautiful, but can
they be defined as fine art?
Perhaps it depends on the artist;
Kate Moss is the proud owner of
two swallows inked on the small of
her back by Lucien Freud. She has
joked that were she to graft the skin
and put it up for auction she could
earn herself a few million pounds.
Fine art institutions have
already started to capitalise on the
popularity of tattoos. In May 2014,
Musée du Quai Branly, Paris,
hosted 'Tatoueurs, Tatoués', or
Tattooists, Tattooed, an exhibition
which explored the history of body
art.
Tattoos occupy the same space
as graffiti in the world of art, the
establishment doesn’t quite know
what to do with it. Tattoos cannot
easily be locked up in glass cases
or bartered for; not yet at least,
though the Wellcome Collection
does in fact have a collection of
preserved tattooed skins. For most
however, inking their skin remains
the ultimate expression of bodily
autonomy; now as for centuries, a
way of marking personal history.The
pain of the process becomes a ritual;
it’s permanence a statement of
artistic intent, that the art changes,
sagging, stretching, shifting with
changing skin is a bonus.

Poem : excerpt from 'That the science of cartography is limited' by Eavan Boland. Image: 'Empty Kingdom' by Edward Burtynsky
That the Science of Cartography Is Limited
—and not simply by the fact that this shading of
forest cannot show the fragrance of balsam,
the gloom of cypresses,
is what I wish to prove.
1847, when the crop had failed twice,
Relief Committees gave
the starving Irish such roads to build.
Where they died, there the road ended
and ends still and when I take down
the map of this island, it is never so
I can say here is
the masterful, the apt rendering of
the spherical as flat, nor
an ingenious design which persuades a curve
into a plane,
but to tell myself again that
the line which says woodland and cries hunger
and gives out among sweet pine and cypress,
and finds no horizon
will not be there.
