et ready for off-
puttingly upbeat lecture
shout outs, a fortnight
of Facebook spam and
unwelcome accosting in the library
over your jacket potato – it’s election
time.
Nominations for positions open
on Wednesday the 3rd
of February
and close on the 28th
of the same
month. Candidate manifestos have
to be uploaded by 5pm the next day,
or you risk relying on just your face
to get that post.
Turnout last year was 42% (60%
undergraduates, 22% post grads).
Since rules changed before the
elections last year, every club with
more than 150 members has to
have its election online within the
union’s eVoting system, rather than
in person at an AGM.
Constituent unions will vote for
their presidents, clubs with more
than 150 members will vote in
their committees and everyone will
vote in the various volunteer roles
within the union, including the
representation officers (Disabilities,
Campaigns, Gender Equality etc).
Several sabbatical officers, who
will take a year out of real life to
debate student issues, will also be
elected. These positions are open
to any current student, regardless
of experience, and offer the chance
to sit on the trustee board, making
real decisions for the future of
Imperial’s student union. They get
paid a tasty £19 grand a year plus
free accomodation in their choice of
halls.
Positions on the trustee board
are also open to students who don’t
want to take a year out.Two student
trustees are elected, and get to sit
on the board, making those big
decisions, whilst still plowing on
with their degrees.
If you prefer the anarchy of union
council, you could go up for council
chair, another part time elected
position. This person gets the final
say over the (sometimes not even
quorate) rabble of students who
debate the issues over at union
council once a month.

Business school Dean sticks up for Bitcoin
The dean spoke out on the economic fad dividing the internet in City A.M.
T
he dean of Imperial’s
Business School
published an article in
Monday’s edition of
City A.M. bemoaning the finance
industry’s complacency when
it came to Bitcoin, and other
cryptocurrencies.
Using the example of Sony
complacent attitude to MP3, which
allowed Apple to sweep in and take
advantage, Professor G. ‘Anand’
Anandalingam warned that big
banks, like Barclays, that have been
closing the accounts of customers
with dealing in Bitcoin, are at risk
of losing out.
Last year, a British teen’s Barclays
account was closed with little
explanation after he’d dabbled in
the Bitcoin trade, and the incident
was not isolated.
The Dean went on to describe the
merits of Bitcoin, saying that big
business should stop seeing it as
currency used by those on the dark
web and embrace the speed it can
bring to electronic transactions.
Having mentioned Imperial’s own
“digital money startup”,Yoyo,he also
used the article to plug Imperial’s
symposium on the subject, brought
to you by Citi bank. The event, held
at Canary Wharf on Tuesday, also
gave the Dean the opportunity to
announce the founding of a new
Centre for Global Finance and
Technology at the Business School.
The centre will be headed up by
Professor Andrei Kirilenko, who
has previously worked for the US
government’s Commodity Futures
Trading Commission and MIT’s
School of Management.
Anandalingam unsurprisingly
hailed Citi as one of the few banks
that had moved with the times
and embraced the new financial
technology, or ‘fintech’.
Bitcoin was started with the
aim of decentralising a currency,
so it wasn’t in control of banks
or governments, but rather by
traceable network of users online.
Recently, the system has struggled
to deal with technical issues.Bitcoin
developer Mike Hearn recently said
that “the community [of Bitcoin]
had failed”, that it was “completely
controlled by a handful of people”
and that the network was on the
“brink of technical collapse”.
