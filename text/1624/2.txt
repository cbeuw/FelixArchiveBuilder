O
h hey there! Take a seat.
There’s been a lot of
talk in the paper this
week about political
correctness gone mad, and all that
gross garb your granny comes up
with at Christmas. But unlike
Grammy, these bite-sized chunks
of bigotry don’t sandwich an M&S
card with a ten pound note inside.
Some LSE students, presumably
the ones that aren’t occupying, have
decided to form a free speech club,
because their strain of debate isn’t
being catered for at a university
well known for political activity.
And look, this isn’t disgusting in
principle.
They say they want to offer a
platform to speakers that have
previously been ‘no-platformed’,
but surely they’re a union club,
so are subject to the union’s safe
space policy just the same as the
Humanists, Palestine Society or
FemSoc. I’d have to go to a meeting
to really judge. If anyone wants to

do the same at Imperial, invite me.
I’d happily be the Holly Willougby
to the Katie Hopkins you find
somewhere.
What I have a problem with is
using free speech as an excuse to be
a dick. Yeah, you can say what you
want,and people are going to die for
your right to say it, but just because
you can say it, does it mean you
should? It’s easy to be inoffensive
and engage in debate. It’s called not
being a terrible person.
It’s a hazy road from debate to
purposely being controversial, with
not being awful about stuff floating
somewhere in the middle. Political
correctness is a phrase certain
folks seem to take as a personal
affront to themselves, despite the
fact that usually they're discussing
a marginalised group that they are
not a part of.
Instead of calling it that, which
upsets people so much, maybe just
replace it with “not being be a dick
and respecting people”. It's easy!
"Why can’t I be a bit racist against
immigrants?"Justdon’tbedickabout
it! "But Muslims think differently
to me, what’s up with that?" Again,
just respect people! "What if trans
people are different to me and I
don’t share their experiences?" Be
nice and not a dick, simple as. Also,
work hard and call your mum at the
weekends. Hot-take over.

Union boss one of 46 representatives of local "business, major employers and
institutions" to sign pro-Crossrail letter
...continued from front page
The signatories’ letter says that
the north-south link would provide
Kensington and Chelsea with the
“integration with the wider London
public transport system, especially
the Underground” which they say it
currently lacks.
The 46 signatories were cultural,
business and health chiefs including
the chief executive of the Chelsea
and Westminster Hospital, the
chair of Harrods, and the director
of the Natural History Museum.
The signatories claimed that the
project would “safeguard the area’s
status as a world-leading cultural
hub and location for pioneering
medical, research and educational
establishments”.
The current plans involve building
the station opposite Chelsea’s Old
Town Hall on the King’s Road. A
campaign opposing the proposal

is being led by some famous local
residents including The Good Life
actor Felicity Kendal and Made In
Chelsea stars Georgia Toffolo and
Hugo Taylor.
The proposals are currently part of
the wider consultation on Crossrail
2 led by TfL who recently reported
19,000 responses, which are
currently being analysed.The project
has previously met with criticism
when Soho’s Curzon Cinema was
earmarked for demolition to build a
Crossrail station’s ticket hall.
“A number of suggestions and
alternative proposals have been put
forward and will be considered”
announced Michèle Dix TfL’s
managing director for Crossrail
2. The results will be published in
Spring.
