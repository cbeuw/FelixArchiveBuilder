O
ver the last few years,
SOPHIE (the stage
name of Samuel Long)
has played many times
in London and around the world.
I’ve been lucky enough to see
him twice. This time he played
at Village Underground, one of
London’s most hip venues. With
each successive live performance
he has debuted new material to the
audience and each time a new song
is debuted the reaction is the same:
pure unadulterated joy.
The hyper-consumerist (yes, his
debut album is called PRODUCT)
nature of SOPHIE’s music and
aesthetic means that nearly every
song he’s produced is calculated
and refined to be addictive and
engaging. He reels his audience
in with obscure, yet oddly familiar
sounds. His use and appropriation
of these is most obvious on his
recent collaboration, ‘Let’s Ride’
with Charli XCX – he mixes her
vocal onomatopoeia such as ‘beep
beep’ and ‘vroom vroom’ with the
sounds themselves. When Long
plays this live, the crowd almost
laughs each time they hear the
sounds of the car. Most people are
There were times when the
audience’s enthusiasm seemed to
fizzle out – when Long played
tracks that weren’t from his recent
release PRODUCT or other
collaborations, but these moments
never lasted long.
The rest of the PC Music crew
(including A.G. Cooke, Danny
L Harle and GFOTY) were all
in attendance. To an outsider (and
to nearly everyone else in the
audience) they were inconspicuous
– they looked like every other ironic
hipster in the crowd. None of them
have really seen the same success as
SOPHIE (although GFOTY will
be supporting Animal Collective
on a number of tour dates later this
year).They too were probably in awe
and will want to emulate his simple
yet iconic live performance.
The set ended with ‘When I
Rule The World’ by LIZ, a song
produced by SOPHIE last year.
LIZ sings “You should do as I say
cause things are gonna be my way.”
At the moment, Samuel Long and
the rest of PC Music might have
I
n interviews, Savages have
always described themselves
as a live band: “you don’t
understand who we are unless
you see us play live.” They aim to
create a reaction with their live act,
something more than static head
bobbing. Watching the video for
‘The Answer,’ the first song on their
new album Adore Life, you might
expect a Savages gig to be a messy,
explosive affair. I expect it might be
if it wasn’t at 8:45 in the morning.
The idea of a gig before work,
without alcohol, is a weird one. But
replacing intoxication with a coffee
high works surprisingly well.
Lead singer Jehnny Beth charms
even at such an early time in the
morning. In between songs she
confidently sips her cup of tea to
the amusement of the crowd. Her
performance throughout the set
is sublime; those at the front were
graced by her presence. At times
she reaches towards members of
the crowd, holds their shoulder
by Beth’s presence. The rest of the
band are more subdued, probably in
need of a few more hours in bed.
Their latest album is brilliant by
itself, I didn’t expect it to gain much
from a live setting, but it does – and
I implore anyone to see Savages on
their upcoming world tour. At one
point, Beth jokes that watching this
gig was the best excuse for being
late to work and that we were all
employees of the month. Even if
I had been late for something, I
would have started the day more
awake than any cup of coffee could
ever induce.
and sings to them, as if there’s no
one else in the room. There is one
moment on ‘Adore’ where the band
are silent; the crowd match this
absence of sound in awe, enchanted

a small, devoted fan base – but
with more collaborations like this
and energetic live performances, it
won’t be long before SOPHIE and
the rest of his friends will rule the
musical world.
here for songs like ‘Lemonade,’
with its comical bubbling, or ‘Hard.’
Everyone knows the words to every
song, but then you’d expect that
when the lyrics are so basic - which
is probably why SOPHIE has done
so well.

Is it human to adore life?

A
dore Life is an album
about the good and the
bad parts of love. The
title should really be a
question because Jenny Beth and
her band are conflicted:“Is it human
to adore life?”
Savages stream of post-punk is
extremely accessible and flirts with
all sorts of sounds. The quartet
come together brilliantly; Gemma
Thompson on guitar provides
grizzly riffs, Ayse Hassan on bass
controls the tempo of each song and
Faye Milton’s drums help induce
intense climaxes. And then there’s
Jehnny Beth, with a voice that
wanders and wanes.
‘The Answer’starts the album with
melodic guitars and the statement
that “Love is the answer.” On ‘Sad
Person’ Beth delivers one of Adore
Life’s best lyrics, “I’m not gonna
hurt you / Cause I’m flirting with
you.” ‘Adore’ starts slow with fuzzy
thrashing guitars and percussion
and we hear a rare twinkling
synth. Then it suddenly ends. It’s
undoubtedly the best song Savages
have ever written.
Beth demonstrates the power
and range of her voice on ‘I Need
Something New,’ delivering
the first few lines completely
unaccompanied before the sound
of a guitar screeches against a high
note. ‘T.I.W.Y.G.’ starts off heavy
with pummelling guitars which
act as an instrumental response to
“That’s what you get when you mess
with love.”
Despite all the problems life
might throw at us, Beth insists that
life is still worth loving (like many
romantic relationships, it’s worth it
for the good bits). Adore Life, on
the other hand, is all good and their
best album yet – an assured and
defiant collection of songs.

Recommended for fans of Flying
Lotus. Iglooghost was recently

One of electronic music’s great
innovators, Oneothrix Point Never,
will be bleeping and blooping again
at the Village Underground after
playing last November.
Chvrches, Royal Albert Hall
31st

Their latest album might not have
been great, but their live act is still
fantastic. If you missed them at
Alexandra Palace in November
you’re in for a treat.

NME Awards Tour, 02 Brixton

Sure, NME might be irrelevant
now, but they can still put together
a great line up. Expect music from

guitars and then the drums kick in
and trick the listener into believing
the song has reached it’s peak.
