The regressive left
Has political correctness become more important than free speech?
Jack Foxabbott
Writer
Y
ou would be forgiven for
expecting a guy like me,
raised by a mother whose
list of accolades includes
filing suits against a nursery nurse
for telling 3-year-old me to remove
my nail varnish because “that’s
what girls wear” and a post office
for not allowing more than two
school children in at a time (ageism,
obviously), to have been well
and truly smothered in leftie PC
rhetoric to the point of opting to
punch myself in the face rather than
mistakenly refer to a transgender
person using a cisgender personal
pronoun.
There are
dozens of
situations
where free
speech was
smothered
by political
correctness
However, I think it’s time those
of us at Imperial and elsewhere
who define ourselves as part of the
hard left join me in taking a look
at the extent to which this rapidly
changing political movement truly
represents us.
The values those on the hard-
left like to claim as their own can
be well described as Robin Hood-
esque. They consider capitalism a
game of chance: those born into
riches generally prosper while those
born into poverty generally stay
there. They want to level out the
playing field so fewer people have to
suffer. They’re sound principles, but
do the more specific political beliefs
and actions of members of this
movement really embody them?
It is quite clear that a significant
proportion of the hard-left has,
A debate is

muting one’s
opponent
in the past five years, become so
obsessed with political correctness
that they are actively stifling free
speech.
Just look at our universities, where
you would expect that free speech
would be protected at all cost.What
kind of institution would want
students to only hear things they
agree with? Where does that get
anyone?
In fact, there are dozens of
situations where free speech was
smothered by political correctness
at even some of the best universities
in the country.
At Oxford, for example, a debate
about the morality of abortion was
shut down by 300 or so people on
the grounds that it was scheduled
to be between two men. Since when
were debates only allowed to take
place between those directly affected
by them? Would an infertile woman
not have been allowed to take part?
Elsewhere,Goldsmiths University
SU voted against a measure to hold
commemorations for Holocaust
Memorial Day because it would be
“Eurocentric”and wouldn’t take into
account atrocities committed by the
UK. Months later, Goldsmiths SU
officer Bahar Mustafa put together
a protest against inequality, with
advertisement saying “If you’ve been
invited and you’re a man and/or
white PLEASE DON’T COME.”
This is obviously preposterous –
imagine seeing a flyer captioned
“WOMEN AND BLACKS NOT
WELCOME.” The culprit would
likely be kicked off their course.
Meanwhile Bahar’s defence, that
minority women could not be racist,
was apparently sufficient.
Satirical T-shirts depicting Jesus
and Mohammed drinking beer
would have got an LSE Atheist
society kicked out of their freshers’
fair had they not covered them up,
as it was deemed offensive by LSE’s
student union, which would make
blasphemy an offence.
I’m offended by loud breathers
and people with BO but I wouldn’t
dream of petitioning for a ban on
such things. While there’s religion
there are people opposed to religion,
just like with anything.
I could go on to talk about how
Birkbeck University have banned
UKIP, 32 UK Universities have
banned magazines including Charlie
Hebdo, The Sun and The Star, UEA
banned a Mexican restaurant from
handing out sombreros because it
represented ‘cultural appropriation’,
hard left societies at a selection of
universities have banned speakers
including Maryam Namazie, Milo
Yiannopoulos, Germaine Grier,
Nigel Farage, David Willets, but I
think the point has been made.
What these people are doing is
simply shutting down other people’s
opinions. If we disagree with people
we should surely invite them along
in order to challenge their opinions.
A debate is not won by muting
one’s opponent. We’re being denied
the opportunity to think and
challenge our opinions just because
a few people get offended. It’s for
this reason that the proposition of
banning Donald Trump from the
UK is ridiculous.
A new term referring to these
social justice warriors has been
thrown around on social media by
Milo Yiannopoulos was banned from Manchester SU because his views could
“incite hatred”. Photo Credit: dailystormer.co.uk
not only the right, but by major
figures like Bill Maher and Richard
Dawkins who stand firmly left of
centre: The Regressive Left.
The Regressive Left are those
who, after Charlie Hebdo and the
Bataclan attacks, rushed to Twitter
not to condemn the attacks but to
beg and plead others not to associate
this Islamic terrorism, terrorism in
the name of Islam, with Islam. The
Regressive Left doesn’t dare criticise
Islam because that would make
them ‘Islamophobic’.
Criticising Islam will not hurt
Muslims any more than criticising a
scientific paper damages the paper –
it does the opposite.These people are
willing to be liberal about everything
but Islam. It is no surprise that
those on the far right are mocking
the hard-left’s ridiculous behaviour:
Milo Yiannopoulos ironically set
up a college scholarship fund only
available to white men. It’s worth
mentioning that when he looked
into the statistics and found that
poor white boys are in fact the
most under-represented group in
universities in the UK and US, he
decided to make this fund a real
thing. Of course, the hard-left
exploded.
The bottom line is we need to chill.
Open debate is what we’re here for.
We can’t purge our lives of anything
that’ll make us question our beliefs,
as considering the opinions of
others is how we grow.
