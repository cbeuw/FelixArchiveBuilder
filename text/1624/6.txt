The Green Paper – the college stance...
The new Green Paper suggests high-achieving universities should increase fees
James Stirling
Provost
L
ast November the
Government published
a Green Paper outlining
proposedchangestohigher
education which, if implemented,
would have a significant impact on
the way universities operate. I was
delighted that Imperial College
Union submitted a response,
and indeed there is a great deal
of common ground between the
Union’s response and that of the
College.
The focus of the College’s response
was the introduction of a Teaching
Excellence Framework (TEF).
The Government proposes that,
through the TEF, an assessment
of each university’s teaching
excellence would be made, drawing
on quantitative measures and an
institutional statement.
Universities achieving certain
levels of attainment in the TEF
would be allowed to increase the fees
they charge Home and European
students to keep up with inflation.
The College welcomes initiatives
that promote excellent teaching.
In the government’s own words,
universities should be “putting
students at the heart of the system”.
A core part of our strategy is to
provide an educational experience
in a vibrant, research-led,
entrepreneurial environment where
students learn alongside researchers
who are experts in their fields and
gain the intellectual and practical
skills to tackle the major challenges
facing society. Our close working
relationship with students, through
Imperial College Union, and with
employers is helping us to achieve
this.
Assessing and incentivising
teaching excellence across the
diverse range of universities in the
UK is not straightforward. Our
response voiced reservations about
the specific proposals in the Green
Paper.
One concern is that the
assessment methods for teaching
excellence proposed for the TEF
fall short of the level of credibility,
rigour and robustness that would
meet our own high standards and
fulfil the Government’s objective
to stimulate higher quality teaching
while maintaining the confidence in
and support of the sector.
The proposed new assessment
framework risks driving the wrong
behaviour, such as a focusing
on particular metrics that can
be ‘gamed’ rather than taking
a balanced approach to quality
enhancement.
For those and other reasons, we’ve
argued strongly in our response that
the TEF should be fully piloted
in order to develop an appropriate
measure of excellence in teaching,
identify unintended consequences,
and gain the confidence of the
sector.
Imperial would be pleased to be
part of any such pilot exercise. We
also said that while we strongly
support policies to encourage
students from disadvantaged
backgrounds to study at research-
intensive universities such as
Imperial, we believe that these
crucial policies should be kept
separate in Access Agreements –
a well-established and effective
system – and not included with
the TEF as suggested in the Green
Paper.
The Green Paper proposes that a
successful outcome in TEF would
allow a university to increase fees
with inflation. We’ve argued that
this link should not be mechanistic.
Teaching quality – in fact, the
quality of the student experience as
a whole – is a goal worthy of being
pursued for its own sake.
In any case, inflation-level
increases in tuition fees will not
address a fundamental problem at
the heart of the higher education
system which the Green Paper does
not adequately discuss: high quality
STEMM (Science, Technology,
Engineering, Mathematics, and
Medicine) education costs more
to deliver than education in other
subjects.
The College is committed to
delivering a high quality educational
experience for our students. This
will require additional income, but
higher fees are not the sole solution.
The support of Government as well
as our corporate and individual
supporters is essential.
...and the student’s view
Luke McCrone
Writer
T
oo many universities in
England have allowed
teaching to become a
“poor cousin to research”.
This was a quote from Universities
Minister Jo Johnson. It seems
the government have responded
accordingly to this dilemma.
So what is the Green Paper
exactly? The Green Paper is a
governmental document which
outlines proposals to “reward
excellent teaching with reputational
and financial incentives”. There is
no commitment to action; instead
it acts as a tool used to simulate
discussion.
It primarily aims to boost teaching
standards, support more people
(from disadvantaged backgrounds)
into university and to give students
better value for money from their
education.
The proposal is partly based
around the notion that not all
universities assign teaching the
same level of importance as
research. High quality research is
currently rewarded via the Research
Excellence Framework (REF). The
government now aims to mimic
this concept by implementing the
Teaching Excellence Framework –
rightfully so.
Despite favouring this seemingly
great reward system, we must
scrutinise the implications of this
proposal. The framework will act
as a substantial measure of an
institution’s educational potential.
It will likely be used as a basis for
deciding league table positions.
From the 2017/18 academic year, it
will even be used as a mechanism for
granting higher-ranked institutions
the ability to increase fees for new
students.
Mr Johnson claimed that whilst
many academic institutions go
above and beyond, there are many
that opt for a “disengagement
contract”.
On the one hand, it is likely that
the presence of stronger incentives
for excellent teaching will drive
universities to optimise their own
teaching potential. On the other
hand, we must ask ourselves if
the additional fee income will
exacerbate the gap between the
competences of higher and lower
ranked universities.
Will this fuel the creation of
an elitist educational hierarchy
comprised of divided teaching-
based and research-based
institutions?
It seems the proposal is aiming
to make the higher education
sector increasingly marketable
and accessible to a wider group
of prospective students. Like any
market fuelled by competition,there
are winners and losers. Will we see
a rise in ‘losing institutions’ that
struggle to keep pace with it all?
Another defensive angle which
Mr Johnson employed during
interrogation of the proposal was
the need to compensate for a “skills
shortage and a skills mismatch”with
graduates entering the working
world. He felt that the proposal
would act as a robust solution for
unfavourable graduate employment
levels. The question in response
to this is quite simple: are we
witnessing a skills shortage, or a job
shortage?
Statistically, a growing population
has dictated an increasing level
of purchased goods, services and
business start-ups meaning more
jobs. Some industries, including
Oil and Gas, are in particularly low
demand for graduate jobs currently.
Therefore, both sides can be argued.
Interestingly, it seems that the
government are inclined towards
manipulating the National Student
Survey (NSS) as an assessment basis
for the TEF. Therefore, the NSS
will likely have a greater bearing on
things than ever before.
I personally feel this is where
Imperial College, as an established
and capable institution, should
really start to up the ante. Imperial’s
NSS output (2% above the sector
average for student satisfaction in
2015) is already remarkable and is
only getting better thanks to the
hard work of many. Nonetheless, I
believe the implementation of other
NSS-related incentives for Imperial
students would only improve the
situation. Introducing an inter-
departmental prize specifically for
the most improved participation
rate (compared to the previous
academic year) seems like a sound
option, for example.
This would require the future
collaboration of the Deputy
President of Education (student
union representative) with the

Imperial education office and
faculty leadership to introduce such
a prize.
I think it is imperative that we as
students understand and respect the
main consequences of the Green
Paper for us as young professionals
entering the working world. One
way of raising awareness is through
the effective communication of this
information to the Imperial student
population,provoking a well needed
interest in the subject.
Another way in which the Green
Paper could significantly impact
the educational landscape is via the
implementation of the Grade Point
Average system. This will alter the
current ‘degree band’ scheme as we
know it. It would aim to support
employers in making recruitment
decisions,as well as helping students
to track their progress throughout
the course duration, not just during
exam period.
The proposals in the Green Paper
have huge scope to benefit many,
including the under-privileged,
yet it seems its modification to the
educational landscape will provoke
controversy. Are we witnessing
an attempt to genuinely improve
the quality and accessibility of
English universities, or are we faced
with a framework within which
universities will compete on every
level in order to financially sustain
themselves?
It’s time for you and I to address
the proposal and adapt to the
change.
Are we about to witness the sculpting of a new higher educational landscape?
