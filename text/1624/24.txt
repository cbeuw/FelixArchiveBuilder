T
he titular metaphor of
Ryan and Amy Green’s
a u t o b i o g r a p h i c a l
exploration game –
that cancer is a dragon – is used
to describe their young son’s
condition to a more innocent
audience. Cancer is a beast that is
likely to haunt most of us directly
or indirectly throughout our lives.
The sheer power of the word cancer
makes it a hard subject to discuss
and communicate. ‘That Dragon,
Cancer’ is the first (mainstream)
game to explore cancer and its
effect on the families of sufferers; it
portrays a difficult struggle between
hope and despair, acknowledging
that we all react in different ways.
While it is the story of one family
– it’s unfortunately a struggle that
many other parents will have to
endure. It’s definitely an emotional
game, however, it’s affect on each
player is likely to differ based on
their own experiences and their
ability to imagine parenthood. I felt
awful for Ryan and Amy, but having
a child feels like such a distant
event to me that there was some
emotional disconnect. It still made
me think how I might react if I was
ever in the same situation, which
is something I’ve never wanted to
consider. It’s clear that Ryan and
Amy react differently to their son’s
cancer. Amy is full of hope and faith
in God, while Ryan despairs. These
two opposing ideas become central
themes of the narrative. If you don’t
have children this is a game worth
playing. If you’ve been through the
same ordeal as the Greens it might
be comforting. For everyone else
That Dragon, Cancer might just be
too depressing.
beautiful, with murky dreamscapes
and dark tree like structures
haunting the landscape (which act
as the physical representation of
cancer in the game).
Modern games rarely make us
think; we play them to escape the
real world, to take part in fantastical
experiences that would otherwise
be impossible. So why is there a
growing trend of indie developers
creating games about their own
lives? There’s been a (not so)
sudden realisation that a medium
where you can actually control and
interact with the world is probably
the best medium to relay personal
experiences. And it’s likely that
virtual reality will enhance these
sort of games even further. Gamers
everywhere should welcome this
growing category.
However, there is still some
resistance to games like That
Dragon, Cancer; many question
if they should really be called
games. Personally, I don’t think this
question needs to be answered; we
don’t need another category of art.
This sometimes divisive reaction
indicates that the art form is still
maturing – when compared to
books and film, games are still in
their infancy.
We shouldn’t judge games by their
ability to make us cry or scream.
Evoking such extreme reactions
is relatively easy. It’s the complex,
subtle emotions that a player feels
that make That Dragon, Cancer
so powerful. It’s not a game that
demands introspection, but by its
end you’ll look back at your own
life and question how you might
respond in the same situation.

The presentation of a narrative
driven game is always important.It’s
obvious that a long time has been
spent making the game flawless in
this respect.To make the game even
more personal, the Green family
provide the voice acting themselves.
They narrate scenes and read out
letters placed throughout the world
with emotional performances.
