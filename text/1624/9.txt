rost can be a problem
in cold climates or at
extreme conditions. It can
form on aeroplane parts
at high altitudes and condenser
coils in fridges and windshields,
particularly during the winter
months. Frost formation can create
such a logistical headache, that in
fact a large amount of money is
required to ensure important units
stay frost-free in order to maintain
their function.
However, a team of researchers
from Virginia Tech has found
an answer in an unlikely source.
Namib desert beetles live in one
of the hottest and driest climates
on Earth, Africa’s Namib desert,
which receives less than 1.3cm of
rainfall a year. In order to survive,
they harvest water vapour from the
ocean breeze through the utilisation
of their unique shell structure.
Whereas bumps on their shell
learned from this peculiar survival
mechanism that they can control
where dewdrops form. To mimic
the beetle’s’ shell, water-attracting
patterns are put on a water-
repelling (hydrophobic) surface.
Dew can only form on top of these
specific patterns. As frost starts
with a single frozen dew drop and
spreads to other connected droplets
across surfaces this information can
be applied to restricting or stopping
this occurrence. If the droplets that
form are confined to very small
areas and kept separated, the spread
of frost can be stopped altogether.
“I appreciate the irony of how an
insect that lives in a hot, dry desert
inspired us to make a discovery
about frost,” said Jonathan Boreyko,
an assistant professor of Biomedical
Engineering and Mechanics at
Virginia Tech. In these initial tests,
Boreyko and his team were able
to create a single dry zone which
surrounded a piece of ice. They are
hoping to scale up their research to
encompass large pieces of machinery
such as wind turbines or aeroplanes
in the future.
This technological breakthrough,
although simple, could save a lot of
money in the aeronautical and wind
energy industries. Currently a large
amount of chemicals are used in
order to defrost equipment.
This is not the first time the Namib
desert beetle has inspired scientists.
Back in 2012, the idea of a self-
filling water bottle was initialised by

It goes to show how biomimicry
can be used for a vast expanse of
ideas, and that there is a lot more
to be discovered from the natural
world that can aid humans in
overcoming complex problems.
attract moisture, the smooth parts
surrounding them repel it. This
causes droplets to form on particular
spots, where they can then be
channelled into the beetle’s mouth
through ridges around the sides of
the shell, providing a welcome and
much needed beverage in these
extreme arid conditions.

ommunicating science
to politicians appears
to be a challenging task
especially when none of
them have an academic research
background. Luckily, 8% have some
form of science degree and seem
interested in current research.
20 years ago a group of science
communicators joined forces with
the government and created the
Parliamentary Office of Science
and Technology (POST). Today
the organisation is led by Dr Chris
Tyler and Dr Chandrika Nath and
consists of twelve staff members
who mediate between politicians
and researchers, informing MPs
of important scientific and
technological issues.
This is achieved through the
production of detailed yet concise
briefings, which are discussed in the
science conference room.
This quarterly process is important
as it allows MPs to make informed,
evidence based decisions on a range
of subjects.

Green Paper: If the TEF is the answer, what’s the question?
We are a gold employer!
Mere months to roll out a national
scheme for measuring the teaching
quality of 1500+ degrees at over 100
institutions. Allowing universities
that produce high earners to charge
more, meaning the institutions that
educate our nurses and carers will
see their income erode. Trapping
students in the bind that if they rate
their education highly, they support
ramping up fees for the next cohort.
Finally, taking the authority to set
tuition fees from Parliament and giving
it to a single politician to raise at will.
The Government’s Higher Education
Green Paper put forward a lot of
ideas; ideas that affect how students
learn - and pay up - for decades to
come. We are proud of our Green
Paper Response (available in full at
imperialcollegeunion.org/greenpaper),
in which we oppose the majority
of the ideas suggested. We found
College, and much of the higher
education sector, agreeing with us.
Imperial College Union has long
lobbied for improved teaching
standards, through our Academic
Representation Network and Student
Academic Choice Awards; we feel
that teaching should be given as
much respect and recognition as
high-impact research. But when a
Teaching Excellence Framework looks
like a back door to raising fees far past
£9k for selected institutions, we get
suspicious. When the sector agrees
that no one has a clear idea how
improvements in teaching excellence
can be reliably and fairly measured,
we get sceptical. Put it this way: even
the universities who want nothing
more than to raise fees right now are
not convinced that the TEF is the right
way to do it. As it stands, the Teaching
Excellence Framework idea is vague,
rushed and unworkable. We ask that it
be delayed, put on a solid foundation
of reliable data and processes, and
tested for its ability to work in favour
of students - and that it doesn’t price
students out of the education they
merit.
There are a number of other
proposals in the Paper; two are worth
mentioning now. One proposal -
snuck in on page 64 - would allow
politicians to raise fees without
Parliamentary approval; we describe
this as fundamentally wrong, a historic
mistake and a deeply undemocratic
decision. The other, on page 61,
asks out of the blue what can be
done to make students’ unions
more democratic and accountable,
including the misguided suggestion
that students’ unions should fall under
the umbrella of trade unions. I don’t
think the Government expected the
outpouring of support and respect
for the educational value of strong
students’ unions that has emerged
from across the sector - including from
College. Students’ unions are amongst
the most transparent and democratic
organisations you can think of, with
high levels of engagement, open
finances, and student involvement at
all levels.
Taken together, these two proposals
sum up the attitude to students and
universities that underlies the whole
Green Paper. Centralise power to
politicians rather than academics,
charge individuals more and more, and
undermine the single biggest group of
people in the whole higher education
system: students.
Imperial College Union will continue to
speak up for its members by opposing
these measures, and suggesting
more sustainable and fairer reforms to
higher education at every opportunity.

Imperial College Union has joined an
elite group of organisations that hold
the Investors in People Gold award
this week. The Investors in People
standard accredits organisations
that excel at leading, supporting
and managing their staff and is
recognised world-wide.
Imperial College Union was awarded
the basic standard in February 2015
and less than a year later the Union
has been awarded the gold standard,
which is only achieved by 7% of
the 15,000 organisations that hold
accreditation. Awarded by Investors
in People assessors, the gold award
judges an organisations ability to
meet over 125 of 130 criteria through
a series of interviews with staff
members. Successful accreditation
against the Investors in People
Gold standard is the sign of a great
employer, an outperforming place
to work and a clear commitment to
sustainability.
Joe Cooper, Managing Director,
Imperial College Union said “Imperial
College Union is led by student
officers and its army of volunteers,
but it needs a team of highly talented,
engaged and committed staff to
ensure that the Union delivers on its
strategic vision of being recognised as
a leader in student development and
engagement. I am incredibly proud
that the ongoing hard work of our
team of staff and our management
team, and the commitment of
our Board of Trustees to staff
development, has been recognised
with this prestigious award. Imperial
College Union is a great place
to work, and this means we can
provide students with even better
activities, representation support and
development opportunities”. Louise
Lindsay, Director of HR, Imperial
College London said “This external
recognition of the high standards of
staff development and professional
practice is a great achievement for the
Union. The award is well deserved
and reflects the transformative journey
the Union have undertaken over the
last few years in staff development
and engagement. An exemplary
role model for others to follow.”
By holding this award the Union
clearly demonstrates that it is a great
place to work, helping us to better
recruit and retain the best possible
staff who in turn can continue to
provide the best services to our
members and excel in our mission to
enhance the student experience at
Imperial College London.
