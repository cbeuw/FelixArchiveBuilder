Joy Tech Jordan Grand Prix Steering Wheel Carmageddon (PSX)
Viv: It w a s with great a n t i c i p a t i o n that I first laid m y h a n d s o n Joy Tech's
PSX w h e e l . E n d o r s e d by J o r d a n G r a n d Prix I h a d visions of m i m i c k i n g the
D a m o n Hill of o l d . . . Boasting a F l c a r style w h e e l , g e a r c h a n g e a n d built
in force f e e d b a c k this piece o f h a r d w a r e certainly c o m e s w e l l - e q u i p p e d .
However, all this p r o m i s e turned t o dust w h e n I eventually j u m p e d in the
driver's seat a n d f o u n d that steering w a s rather m o r e difficult than first
h o p e d . Adjusting sensitivity m a d e little difference, the c a r either wouldn't
turn at all o r instead went into a n u n c o n t r o l l a b l e swerving m o t i o n , e n d i n g
up with a n artistic spin. A s frustration a n d r o u g h h a n d l i n g i n c r e a s e d , the
force f e e d b a c k vibrations b e c a m e barely n o t i c e a b l e . A n o t h e r p r o b l e m
c o m m o n t o most w h e e l controllers is that a n aggressive turn w h e n you're
trying t o beat a sharp c o r n e r usually results in your lifting the wheel in the
air, - wheels a r e simply not heavy e n o u g h f o r serious driving. At the e n d
of the d a y you've g o t to ask yourself whether its worth having such a bulky
a c c e s s o r / - personally I don't believe a n y o f t h e m a r e worth the desk
s p a c e .
Ben's View: M y view of the Joytech
wheel c a n b e s u m m e d u p in o n e
word - d i s a p p o i n t i n g . W h i l e the
wheel gives a m u c h better feeling
of actually driving a car, w h a t it
doesn't give y o u is a n y sort of c o n -
trol over the g a m e . I f o u n d myself
constantly w e a v i n g f r o m left t o
right a n d s p i n n i n g off the track in
every racing g a m e I p l a y e d . T h e
whole point of a s p e c i a l i s e d driv-
ing wheel is that it m a k e s it easier
to drive, not harder. If I'd p a i d
money f o r this thing I'd b e b a c k at
the s h o p by n o w d e m a n d i n g a
refund.
Mark's View: It's b i g , b l a c k a n d
l o o k s i m p r e s s i v e (not that t h i n g ,
t h e o t h e r t h i n g ) . I'm t a l k i n g
a b o u t t h e J o y t e c h s t e e r i n g
w h e e l . It d o e s l o o k g o o d a n d
o n e w o u l d h a v e t h o u g h t w o u l d
be t h e i d e a l a n s w e r t o a l l t h o s e
h a r d - t o - c o n t r o l d r i v i n g g a m e s
( G r a n d T o u r i s m o a n y o n e ? ) .
Surely a j o y p a d s h a p e d like a
w h e e l is g o i n g t o b e t h e closest
we c o m e t o the real t h i n g . It is a
g o o d i d e a but s a d l y t h e w h e e l is
just a t a d t o o sensitive a n d turns
h a r d g a m e s i n t o i m p o s s i b l e
o n e s . A slight n u d g e o f the w h e e l
d o e s n o t h i n g b u t a n extra m i c r o n
of p r e s s u r e a n d y o u a r e d o i n g
3 6 0 ' s a l l o v e r the s h o p . It takes a
bit o f p e r s e v e r a n c e t o master.
O n c e m a s t e r e d it is g o o d f u n but
I think it still n e e d s s o m e fine-
t u n i n g . O n c e this is d o n e I'm
sure it will b e a sure-fire hit. It
will g i v e a h i g h e r p l a y a b i l i t y a n d
p l e a s u r e t o a l l r a c i n g g a m e s . 2
out o f 5 but with t u n i n g a n easy
4 o u t of 5.

Partially b a n n e d f o r its v i o l e n t
nature, C a r m a g e d d o n is a wild rac-
ing g a m e . Set in the year 2 0 2 8 , a
new sport has been born to control
a catastrophic accident that trans-
f o r m e d part of the h u m a n race into
z o m b i e s (could happen).
There are several ways in which y o u
c a n play this g a m e . Firstly you c a n
treat it as a standard racing g a m e
a n d c o m p l e t e the allotted a m o u n t
of laps faster than a n y b o d y else.
This, however, is dull a n d s o m e -
thing y o u c a n d o with a n y other
driving g a m e . Alternatively y o u c a n
waste anything that moves. This
involves m o w i n g d o w n the z o m b i e s
in a gratuitous fashion o r kicking
the **** o u t o f the other cars by
r a m m i n g them to bits but preferably
both. It's the w a y that y o u c a n per-
form these actions that m a k e it all
worthwhile t h o u g h . F o r instance,
r a m p i n g off a 100-storey building
while performing a triple somersault
to land o n a police c a r scores high-
ly, a s d o e s a h a n d b r a k e turn at 1 0 0
m p h into a g r o u p of z o m b i e s . That
earns you a " c o m b o bonus". S q u a s h
the d e a d m e n w a l k i n g into a waii
for a "piledriver bonus" a n d y o u
might even earn a p p l a u s e f o r "artis-
tic impression". There a r e also lots
of wacky power-ups that c a n a i d
you in the quest o f c a n i n g your
o p p o n e n t s , such a s the hot r o d a n d
o p p o n e n t freeze, but there a r e oth-
ers that c a n s o m e w h a t hinder your
progress, such a s jelly suspension
a n d lunar gravity. Y o u must not for-
get that during your zealous car-
n a g e your o w n c a r will b e getting
p u m m e l l e d s o y o u must collect
credits so y o u c a n repair your c a r in
order f o r y o u t o continue the r a m -
p a g e .
I loved this g a m e b e c a u s e it w a s
original a n d the g a m e p l a y is highly
addictive. There isn't a n y arsing
a r o u n d with careful driving; you're
not trying t o w i n the g r a n d prix o r
anything. It is pure pleasure, just
like being in a crockery s h o p a n d
being a b l e t o g o completely a p e
a n d being r e w a r d e d f o r your trou-
ble in d o i n g s o . Fantastic.
