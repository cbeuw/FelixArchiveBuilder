Having seen their debut project The Blair Witch Pro-
ject storm to massive financial a n d critical success
across the world, directors Daniel Myrick a n d
Eduardo Sanchez are n o w two of the hottest p r o p -
erties in Hollywood. S o are they really a couple of
talented young hopefuls o r a pair of movie brats?
Well, here's your c h a n c e to find out, with o u r very
own interview.
Your brain is telling you it's real a n d you're trying to
tell yourself it's not so it's easy to thing it's real.
Is it true that Heather Donahue earned a knife with
her during the shooting of the film?
DAN: Yeah, it was a pretty big knife. H e r m o m d i d -
n't want her to d o the film with a bunch of strangers
in a w o o d so she bought this big knife. Just in case.
really fortunate with an eight minute trailer we pro-
d u c e d , as John Pearson h a d a show called 'Split
Screen' in N e w York City a n d wanted to air o u r
trailer o n that show so he paid us s o m e money for
the rights to that a n d it helped us out. W e didn't
have to raise a lot, but $ 3 0 , 0 0 0 when you're broke
might as well be $ 3 0 million - but we m a n a g e d to
scrape it together.
Are you planning to do any sequels or prequels to
The Blair Witch Project?
ED: We're talking to Artisan about d o i n g another
Blair film. It's not going to be a sequel but we have
an idea for a prequel that is pretty c o o l but we're
going to have to see if they're g o n n a let us d o it or
not. It's really up to them. They o w n the film n o w ;
they o w n Blair Witch. It looks like they might let us
do it but it has to be the right time for us a n d the
right time for them.
What were Heather, Josh and Michael like after the
film shoot?
DAN: W h a t you guys watch is 8 2 minutes of about
twenty hours of raw footage. They knew it was us
running around the tent 'cos we shot the film in this
whole real-time format were we had the actors g o
out there a n d run this improvisation situation. The
whole process was a n experiment. It was tough o n
everybody. W e h a d a 2 4 7 shoot o n o u r side as
well. O n o n e side, it was very tough a n d very drain-
ing but as a n actor, they h a d the opportunity to d o
an eight-day play 2 4 hours a day in character with
total creative freedom. They're probably never
g o n n a get that opportunity again. As tiring as it was
at the e n d , it was really rewarding for everybody.
Do you know of anyone who saw the film and
thought it was real?
Ed: A friend of ours took the movie when we h a d
just finished editing it a n d p o p p e d it into his V C R at
home a n d his m o m ended u p watching it a n d he
didn't tell her it wasn't real. Everybody has a c a m -
corder a n d as s o o n as a friend pops in a vacation
video you're convinced it's real because there's
shaky c a m e r a a n d the same thing works for Blair.
Was there any inspiration from films like Man Bites
Dog and Cannibal Holocaust?
ED: I've never actually seen ' M a n Bites Dog', it's o n e
that's o n a long list of films to see when we get
h o m e . As for C a n n i b a l Holocaust we didn't find out
that film existed until s o m e o n e at Sundance told us
that it h a d the same premise as Blair Witch. S o we
went h o m e a n d went to a video store that rent real-
ly obscure bootleg type films a n d we checked it out.
It's the exact same premise as Blair. This d o c u m e n -
tary crew goes to Peru or South A m e r i c a in search
of a cannibal tribe a n d they find it a n d never get
out. I guess they are eaten. W e didn't even finish it.
It's pretty brutal. They kill animals on screen a n d
that's their gore. There's o n e scene where we're sure
they use a h u m a n corpse for o n e of the effects.
W h a t really inspired Blair were those o l d d o c u m e n -
taries. In the states they had these p s e u d o - d o c u -
mentaries with Leonard N i m o y narrating about
U F O ' s , Bigfoot a n d stuff like that a n d as kids Ed
a n d I were terrified by those things so that was real-
ly the inspiration behind Blair.
Do you think the film works better on the big screen
or will it be better on video?
Ed: I think it works well o n the big screen but I think
it does work better o n video. A lot of people w h o
g o to the movie say that film didn't scare them a n d
I always write to them a n d say "When the movie
comes out o n video, rent it, g o to your house alone
at 1 a m a n d p o p it in a n d tell me if it scared you." I
think it works better that way
Did you find it easy to finance the film?
Dan: N o , most of the financing was out of our o w n
credit cards, savings, friends, a n d family. W e were
Did you actually attempt to show what was harass-
ing the actors in the film?
Dan: Back to the documentaries of the seventies -
there's really nothing conclusive about them. You
see a grainy photo of a U F O o r Bigfoot running
through the woods. It was the realism about those
things at the time that got to us. O u r prime direc-
tive was to keep everything real. W e didn't have the
budget o r technical know-how to show something
that was convincingly real. Almost out of necessity,
we followed this line of keeping it real. Anything in
the raw footage that looked contrived; we got rid of
it.
Do you think you are marketing a myth or concept
rather than just a film?
Dan: Exactly, yes. I think that's what's unique about
Blair Witch. That it is a whole world that it is a whole
mythology a n d the film you see is really just a part
of it. It didn't start out that way but it certainly
evolved over time. That's what I loved about Star
Wars o r Star Trek. They h a d a whole world created
a r o u n d those films a n d o n a small level that's what
we did with Blair Witch. The w e b site has enabled
us to have this complementary experience that
showed the mythology about the movie a n d it was
definitely this c o m p o n e n t thing of this bigger thing.
Is the film called The Blair Witch Project after Linda
Blair in The Exorcist?
Dan: it was n a m e d after Blair high school in M a r y -
land a n d it's a g o o d generic n a m e that sound like
a bunch of other mythology in that area so it just
blended in with truth. There's no reference to The
Exorcist in any way; it's just coincidence.
