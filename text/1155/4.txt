Them and NUS

As w e all (hopefully) know, Imperial
C o l l e g e isn't a f f i l i a t e d t o t h e
N a t i o n a l U n i o n of Students. W h y
not? After a l l , practically every other
college a n d university u n i o n in the
country is a m e m b e r , [with the
exception of most of the Scottish
H i g h e r E d u c a t i o n institutions (of
which m o r e later) a n d , as of last
m o n t h , U M I S T ] , yet since the
1930's Imperial C o l l e g e U n i o n h a s
b e e n a m e m b e r f o r a g r a n d total of
six years. [ICU last left in 1 9 7 9 ,
w h e n Trevor Phillips (a f o r m e r I C U
President a n d p o t e n t i a l D e p u t y
M a y o r of London) w a s l e a d i n g the
N U S ] .
Costs
Re-affiliating to the N U S w o u l d cost
I C U between £ 2 0 K a n d £ 5 0 K a
year, d e p e n d i n g o n w h o y o u talk t o ,
but in all probability the final figure
w o u l d be a r o u n d £ 3 0 0 0 0 . H o w e v -
er, that's only a fifth of w h a t w e p a y
the University of L o n d o n U n i o n , o r
3 % of the Union's total C o l l e g e
grant, s o is it really that m u c h ?
W e l l , f r o m a cost effectiveness
point of view, m e m b e r s h i p of the
N U S primarily m e a n s m e m b e r s h i p
of N U S S L ( N U S Services Ltd), which
is r e g a r d e d by most students unions
as the m a i n reason f o r staying with
the national body. N U S S L is effec-
tively a p u r c h a s i n g c o n s o r t i u m
w h i c h a l l o w s u n i o n s a c c e s s t o
c h e a p supplies of beer, stationary,
f o o d , sports kit a n d other student
staples - in other w o r d s it's the r e a -
son that student bars up a n d d o w n
the country m a n a g e to keep their
prices so low. It's a l s o the reason
that the Scottish universities d e c i d e d
to leave the national b o d y - as they
weren't a l l o w e d to disaffiliate f r o m
o n e without a u t o m a t i c a l l y quitting
the other, they resigned f r o m the
N U S as a w h o l e in protest.
However, b a r prices at) IC a r e
as l o w as a n y other student b a r in
L o n d o n - so d o e s IC subsidise it's
prices o r buy it's b e e r o n the black
market? N o , it's m u c h s i m p l e r -
instead of rigidly a d h e r i n g to o n e
consortium I C U uses a mixture of
N o r t h e r n Services (a p u r c h a s i n g
g r o u p set u p by the Scottish stu-
dents u n i o n s , which a n y o n e c a n
join f o r a tiny fee), T U C O (the C o l -
lege p u r c h a s i n g group) a n d local
c o n s o r t i u m s , a n d c o n s e q u e n t l y
gets, by a n d large, the s a m e (if not
better) prices than every other union
in the country.
Representation
O K , s o what's the point of having a
n a t i o n a l representative b o d y f o r
any g r o u p of p e o p l e ? To exert
p o w e r at the highest levels, push f o r
the rights of it's m e m b e r s , ensure
fair a n d e q u a l treatment a n d p r o -
vide a system of support a n d train-
i n g , right? In theory, that's exactly
what the N U S is s u p p o s e d to d o . In
reality, however, it's c a m p a i g n i n g
record in recent years has b e e n less
than enviable. O p p o s i t i o n to fees
was s o badly o r g a n i s e d a n d inef-
fective it has p r o v o k e d d a m n a t i o n
f r o m every sector of H i g h e r E d u c a -
tion. O p p o s i t i o n to the a b o l i t i o n of
grants w a s e q u a l l y non-existent,
a n d it's only now, with the decisions
in p l a c e a n d a l m o s t entirely u n a l -
terable, that m a r c h e s a n d d e m o n -
strations of a n y note a r e b e g i n n i n g
to filter t h r o u g h f r o m the leader-
ship. N o n e t h e l e s s , national repre-
sentation a n d c a m p a i g n i n g is a n
essential requirement if w e a r e to
have any input in the w a y H i g h e r
E d u c a t i o n is run in the next millen-
nia - so wouldn't it b e better to be
o n the inside? T h e difficulty is that
the p r o b l e m with N U S is e n d e m i c
rather than issue-specific. Until the
entire national student m o v e m e n t
u n d e r g o e s a r a d i c a l s h a k e - u p ,
nothing's g o i n g to c h a n g e . . .
So what is the p r o b l e m ? Lack of
c o m m u n i c a t i o n ? P o o r m a r k e t i n g
a n d PR? O r is it simply the c a s e that
the N U S leadership puts it's political
g o a l s a h e a d of the national student
interest. T h e fact that w h e n , in the
last r o u n d of elections, N U S Presi-
dent A n d r e w Pakes w a s returned f o r
a s e c o n d term by a narrow m a r g i n ,
it threatened to be the first time in
seventeen years that L a b o u r Stu-
dents (the youth w i n g of the Labour
party) h a d not controlled N U S is
p r o b a b l y a strong sign of the politi-
cal nature of the o r g a n i s a t i o n . A n d
whilst a n y kind of political agitation
is g o i n g to s e e m foreign to proud-
to-be-apolitical I C , the shear level
of behind-the-scenes m a c h i n a t i o n s
o r g a n i s e d by M r Pakes s h o c k e d the
entire N U S C o n f e r e n c e . In a des-
perate attempt to cling to p o w e r v i a
splinter sections of the L a b o u r block
vote, M r Pakes withdrew the L a b o u r
Student e n d o r s e m e n t f r o m several
of his c o l l e a g u e s a n d passed it o n t o
a set of h a n d p i c k e d puppets c h o -
sen f r o m the key institutions a n d
voting g r o u p s . H e is now, of c o u r s e ,
tipped f o r a very senior job in the
L a b o u r Party's next election c a m -
p a i g n (another interesting statistic
shows that after the last election
there were sixteen different L a b o u r
M P s w h o h a d previously held the
position of N U S President...).
Alternatives
Basically, they're aren't any a l t e r n a -
tives. Trades U n i o n ' s in g e n e r a l
don't tend to work o n a c o m p e t i -
tive, free market basis - after a l l ,
what kind of national representa-
tion c o u l d b e a c h i e v e d if there were
two national b o d i e s c a m p a i g n i n g
in o p p o s i n g directions. T h e only
b o d y that c o m e s close is the A l d -
w y c h G r o u p , w h o s e a i m s , o b j e c -
tives a n d m e m b e r s h i p a r e very dif-
ferent. For starters, the G r o u p w a s
set up to represent the students of
the " b e t t e r " universities (although
recent L e a g u e tables might differ
substantially with the identities of
the fifteen members) a n d has as it's
primary objective the a v o i d a n c e of
top-up, means-tested a n d tutorial
fees f o r h o m e students. M o r e o v e r ,
a l t h o u g h I C U is a m e m b e r (as
m e m b e r s h i p is free), the A l d w y c h
G r o u p ' s r e c o r d o n securing c o n -
crete a c c o m p l i s h m e n t s is n o more
impressive than that of the N U S
itself.
Effectively, I C U doesn't n e e d to
affiliate to the N U S in the full
k n o w l e d g e that t h e N U S c a m -
p a i g n s (however ineffectively) o n
behalf of it's students anyway. Put
simply, nothing will c h a n g e until a n
a p p r e c i a b l e n u m b e r of u n i o n s
leave N U S - a n d c o n s i d e r i n g the
n u m b e r of s t u m b l i n g blocks that the
leaders of the n a t i o n a l b o d y tend to
put in the w a y of potential leavers,
such a n o u t c o m e is m o r e than
unlikely, at least in the short term.
For n o w we'll just continue to sit
happily o n the outside, awaiting
d e v e l o p m e n t s .
