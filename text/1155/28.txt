R/C Stunt Copter (PSX)
A n airborne radio-controlled vehicle is often the
d r e a m present f o r m a n y kids. Unfortunately
however it's usually only the pretentious little rich
gits that ever get hold of o n e . R/C Stunt C o p t e r
from Interplay allows everyone t o s a m p l e t h e
flavour of flying a r/c helicopter, without the fear
of having t o fork o u t hundreds if y o u crash the
d a m n t h i n g . . .
Stunt C o p t e r w a s d e s i g n e d to work with the
Playstation D u a l S h o c k controller, e n a b l i n g t h e
player to use o n e a n a l o g u e stick f o r directional
rotation a n d the other for thrust. If you don't have
this controller the left a n d right control pads o n
the original joypad will suffice. Initially movement
is extremely tricky a n d you'll find yourself c o n -
stantly h a v i n g t o juggle your c o n c e n t r a t i o n
between altitude, thrust a n d angle as you e d g e
o n w a r d a n d upward. This c a n be very frustrating,
especially considering the fact that it's plain obvi-
ous what y o u have to d o , it's just difficult to exe-
cute the action. For o n c e then the training levels
are absolutely necessary a n d anyone w h o goes
diving in at the d e e p e n d will get a sordid confi-
d e n c e bashing. Supposedly you should be able
to enjoy the g a m e more after training, having
g a i n e d competency in integrating all aspects of
flying without t o o m u c h thought. A fine theory,
but y o u need to be patient e n o u g h to reach that
stage, a n d I f o r o n e certainly wasn't. W h e t h e r it
be s l a l o m courses o r b a l l o o n shooting, the mis-
sions themselves a r e highly disappointing a n d
rarely last longer than a c o u p l e of minutes. Even
the 2-player m o d e is fairly poor, with each player
taking their turn to c o m p l e t e the level objectives,
rather than flying simultaneously. The most fun to
be h a d actually c o m e s w h e n you're watching your
o p p o n e n t , as y o u c a n drive them m a d by sticking
a w h o p p i n g great h a n d in front of their view (wit-
ness screenshot).
The yankee c o m m e n t a t o r will also provide s o m e
light relief - that is until he gets a n n o y i n g . G e n -
erally s p e a k i n g the s o u n d a n d graphics a r e quite
g o o d f o r this sort of g a m e a n d the control is well
d e s i g n e d , but these factors d o not m a k e u p f o r
the repetitious, difficult a n d b o r i n g gameplay.
Stunt C o p t e r isn't b a d , it just doesn't present
e n o u g h to keep all but a small g r o u p of fanatics
interested f o r long.

LMA manager (PSX)
C o n s o l e s are not renowned f o r complex, m a n -
agement type g a m e s , but Codemasters' L A M
m a n a g e r is a serious non-conformer w h e n it
c o m e s to such stereotyping. At last there is a foot-
ball m a n a g e m e n t g a m e f o r a console which c a n
match the very best available f o r the P C - a n d
that's without a keyboard a n d mouse.
As with most footy sims, the player c a n be assured
of up-to-date stats (the current 1 9 9 9 - 2 0 0 0 sea-
son complete with its real-life fixture list is your
starting point) a n d total control of their club - if
they want it. For the less patient g a m e r tasks such
as player training a n d sponsorship deals c a n b e
assigned to assistant managers without detracting
too much fun from the g a m e . Watching your
team in action is highly entertaining a n d recreates
s o m e of the tension y o u get from watching your
favourite club o n T V O f course, if the game's not
going so well y o u c a n alter team tactics o r bring
in fresh b l o o d at any time during the match. After-
math match analysis a n d 3 D highlights are simi-
larly excellent with commentary from Ray Stubbs
a n d the woefully g o o d A l a n H a n s e n .
U p g r a d i n g your stadium is a fantastic way to
waste money, especially o n a club like Brighton
where the attendance rarely rises a b o v e the 5 , 0 0 0
mark. C o a x i n g quality players to your club is a
feat to behold in the lower divisions, but this is
where y o u should start as its far more satisfying
taking a lowly Division 3 side all the way to the
top, rather than starting out with a ready-made
premiership member. The youth squad provides
an excellent pool of potential young stars, a n d if
you are particularly scheming then you'll promote
them all to the first team a n d flog ' e m off the next
season. If the 5 0 year career m o d e does not
a p p e a l then there are a number of challenges to
be tried out, a n d you'll be able to c o m p a r e your
final score with others over the Internet. Take o n
a flatmate in 2-player m o d e a n d prepare f o r
s o m e serious competition in the league. (Just for
the record I landed 13th position for Brighton in
the 1st season while my room-mate attained rele-
gation for Torquay... hahaha!)
L A M manager has been s o magnificently e n g i -
neered a r o u n d the Playstation that the myriad of
options available c a n be accessed a n d c h a n g e d
with m i n i m u m fuss, using a simple L/R button
menu system. All managerial screens are clearly
presented with easy to read text, a n d excellent
mini-animations t o o . Deservedly s o , L M A m a n -
ager nestled in at the t o p of Playstation sales
charts everywhere. Nuff said.
