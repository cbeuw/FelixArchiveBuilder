This is not a question that m a n y

ing a n d s u b s e q u e n t l y r e s i g n i n g
from the a t o m i c b o m b project d u r -
ing the S e c o n d W o r l d War.
Born in 1 9 0 8 , Sir J o s e p h spent
his first thirty years in Poland before

Shortly after Sir Joseph's discov-
ery, w a r b r o k e o u t in E u r o p e .
A t o m i c scientists in the U S A wrote to
President Roosevelt, warning o f the
d a n g e r s p o s e d by a G e r m a n a t o m -

consent to the project, c o d e - n a m e d

U n d e r the direction of Robert J

allied scientist to its cause.
Sir J o s e p h a g r e e d with the p r o -
ject's motivation, that it w a s vital
that the allies d e v e l o p a n a t o m i c
w e a p o n before the Nazis, to safe-

kind of totalitarianism. However,
w h e n intelligence sources revealed
that the G e r m a n project w a s f l o u n -
d e r i n g , the motivation to build the
b o m b c h a n g e d a n d Sir J o s e p h took
the u n p o p u l a r decision to resign.
His c o l l e a g u e s preferred to stay
until the first test h a d been c o m p l e t -

directing the b o m b u p o n civilian
targets. By that stage the b o m b h a d

Sir J o s e p h m o v e d into m e d i c a l
physics where he continued his dis-
tinguished career a n d spent m u c h
of his time c a m p a i g n i n g for practi-
cal a n d socially responsible a p p l i -
cations of science. H e is the only
surviving signatory of the Russell-
Einstein m a n i f e s t o , a d o c u m e n t
which led t o a meeting of scientists
in a smali C a n a d i a n town, P u g -
w a s h , t o discuss the role of science
a n d world affairs. Since then, the
" P u g w a s h C o n f e r e n c e s " h a v e
b e c o m e a n influential b o d y of e m i -
nent scientists that continue to voice
o p i n i o n s u p o n the a p p l i c a t i o n of
science today. It was Sir Joseph's
efforts that earned h i m the N o b e l
Peace Prize, together with the P u g -
w a s h organisation in 1 9 9 5 .
In the s a m e spirit, a "Student
P u g w a s h " g r o u p has b e e n set up at
Imperial C o l l e g e a n d Sir Joseph's
lecture m a r k e d the first in a series of
lectures, a i m e d at exploring the
social responsibilities of scientists.

Overseas Societies
Comittee elected at last
DINESH GANESARAJAH
O n the 5th attempt to hold elections
for a new committee for the 1 9 9 9 /
2 0 0 0 A c a d e m i c year, the O v e r s e a s
Students C o m m i t t e e ( O S C ) seems
to finally have a set of officers to
represent the overseas societies of
Imperial C o l l e g e U n i o n . S e n
G a n e s h w a s victorious in winning
the O S C Chair, with M o g a i n i n g
V i c e - C h a i r a n d S a c h i n attaining
Treasurer. T h e previous efforts t o
hold elections h a d b e e n unsuccess-
ful d u e to the low turnout o f eligible
voters (the chairs o f the individual
O S C societies).
With 3 0 % of Imperial C o l l e g e
m a d e u p foreign students, O S C is
seen as playing a n important role in
Imperial C o l l e g e . T h e highlight of
the O S C c a l e n d a r has always been
International Night, which in recent
years has continued t o consistently
m a k e heavy losses. Traditionally a
f o o d fair followed by a s h o w a n d
d i s c o , International Night is the o n e
o c c a s i o n where overseas societies
are given the opportunity to reveal
their culture t o the rest of Imperial.
However, there have even been
suggestions that another disaster
will spell the e n d of this a n n u a l
event.
In this light, the new committee
will have a tough task a h e a d . N o w
that the n e w a c a d e m i c year is fully
under way, with the new personnel
only having b e e n elected recently,
the c h a l l e n g e for the new c o m m i t -
tee looks to b e even tougher. T h e
c h a l l e n g e s will i n c l u d e p l a y i n g
catch u p to b e c o m i n g financially
trained a n d versed in the b u r e a u -
cracy of I C U , as well as improving
c o m m u n i c a t i o n between the O S C
g r o u p a n d its societies, the lack of
which has b e e n the very reason for
the late elections. With International
Night just over 3 months away, the
1 9 9 9 / 2 0 0 0 A c a d e m i c year looks
to b e a n interesting o n e for O S C .
