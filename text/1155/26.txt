A horror movie by John Carpenter, director of such
cult flicks as The Thing, Village of the D a m n e d a n d
H a l l o w e e n , should b e a n event not to miss. The sad
truth is that his latest film, Vampires, wili probably
pass by without m u c h a c c l a i m .
The story follows Jack C r o w (James W o o d s ) as leader
of T e a m Crow', a g r o u p of M e r c e n a r y Vampire slay-
ers f u n d e d by the C a t h o l i c C h u r c h . By 'cleaning out a
nest1
s o m e w h e r e in M e x i c o - enter over use of a m i g o
a n d padre - they incur the wrath of a powerful mas-
ter vampire n a m e d Valek w h o decimates the entire
team except C r o w a n d M o n t o y a (Daniel Baldwin,
another of the Baldwin brothers). It is left to them to
prevent Valek from finding the Berziers Cross. This
cross w o u l d allow him a n d all vampires to walk by
day, m a k i n g them impossible to kill.
This story is a g o o d i d e a ; it has so m u c h promise but
is s o m e h o w left a little thin. The m m is slow-paced
a n d deliberated. It is somewhere between a spaghet-
ti western (over long shots of tough men in a desert
background) a n d a h a m m e r horror (latex body parts
a n d plenty of blood). Still the production qualities are
high, especially considering the modest budget of
$20 million. For a horror it is rarely scary, leaving you
firmly rooted at the back of your seat. This is p r o b a -
bly because you feel little empathy with a n y of the
characters, particularly W o o d s , w h o seems deter-
m i n e d to d o things the hard way.
It w o u l d b e unfair to say that o n c e the film h a d start-
ed I wasn't interested in the e n d , a n d the c i n e m a t o g -
raphy is certainly g o o d ; but somewhere a l o n g the
line, it just fails t o capture the imagination. Perhaps
this is because it treads an uneasy line between trying
to be g r o u n d breaking while still keeping to the v a m -
pire ethos. The vampires may be i m m u n e to garlic but
they still w e a r gothic eveningwear.
For a Friday night out this film is hardly r e c o m m e n d -
a b l e , but f o r a c h a n g e from the usual H o l l y w o o d
blockbuster it may b e worth a look.
