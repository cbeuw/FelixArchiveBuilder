Bidding Wars
D e s p i t e t h e n e g a t i v e press, R o n s a n g e l s ( n a m e d ,
a c c o r d i n g t o M r Harris, in tribute t o l o w g r a d e 7 0 ' s

to push a s k i n g prices w a y a b o v e their starting levels.
Indeed, even before the official l a u n c h o f the "serv-

Man or Monster?
Ron Harris, the m a n r e s p o n s i b l e f o r the site h a s a past
that c o u l d b e d e s c r i b e d a s " c h e q u e r e d " at best. A
one-time p o r n o g r a p h e r , director, p h o t o g r a p h e r a n d
author, he's best k n o w n f o r his previous venture into
c o m m e r c i a l b r e e d i n g - he used t o raise A r a b i a n hors-
es before selling t h e m o n f o r $ 2 0 0 0 0 a p i e c e . A s a
p h o t o g r a p h e r he c l a i m s t o have p r o d u c e d c o v e r art-

lengthy c a r e e r with Playboy (for w h o he h a s a l s o
directed a series o f "artistic s p e c i a l s " ) .
Ultimately, h e ' s a classic entrepreneur, h a v i n g

veyor o f p o r n in the seventies, before m o v i n g into
exercise p r o g r a m m e s a n d v i d e o s in t h e health c o n -
scious eighties. A final flourish with the extreme e d g e

Parental Responsibility
From the m o m e n t I h e a r d a b o u t the site f o r the first
time, t w o questions have f l a s h e d a r o u n d m y h e a d .
Firstly, w h a t kind o f p e o p l e w o u l d w a n t t o effectively
buy their child (or, p e r h a p s m o r e accurately, their
child's parent) in this way. But the s e c o n d , a n d per-
h a p s m o r e interesting, point is w h a t kind o f p e o p l e
w o u l d w a n t to put themselve s o n the m a r k e t in such a
w a y ? After a l l , it's n o t like trying t o sell a kidney o r
b o n e m a r r o w t o m a k e a fast buck - w e ' r e talking
a b o u t selling off the rights t o a child that is, b i o l o g i -
cally s p e a k i n g , 5 0 % yours. O f c o u r s e , h u n d r e d s o f
m e n d o n a t e to s p e r m b a n k s every day, a n d e g g d o n a -
tions a r e f a r f r o m u n c o m m o n (although t h e process
involves intensive g e n e therapy a n d c o m p l e x surgery),
but those a r e (usually) a n o n y m o u s . A s with a d o p t i o n ,
the d o n o r c a n never k n o w the identity of their offspring
- o r even if their offering p r o d u c e d a c o n c e p t i o n -
a n d s o p a r e n t h o o d c a n r e m a i n a n u n k n o w n , r e s p o n -
sibility-free, quantity. In this c a s e , however, the d o n o r
must meet (and a g r e e terms with) the buyer, a n d will
forever b e a w a r e of the existence of their c h i l d , whilst
the c o u p l e c o n c e r n e d will live the k n o w l e d g e o f t h e
identity o f their child's true p a r e n t a g e . Will they,
i n d e e d s h o u l d they, tell their child? A n d w h a t h a p p e n s
if the child wants to get t o k n o w it's b i o l o g i c a l m o t h -
er? Indeed, in the litigation frenzy that continually
grips the U S , w h a t h a p p e n s w h e n o n e of the children
d e c i d e s t o sue that self-same m o t h e r f o r d e s e r t i o n . . .
But b a c k t o the first point - w h a t kind of p e o p l e
put their e g g s up f o r sale? O n e of the m o d e l s involved
in the s a l e , 2 6 y e a r o l d Misty M c F e r n (who describes
herself as a struggling actress) put it simply, "I'd rather
d o this than d o Playboy o r Penthouse". A l t h o u g h
m o r a l l y d u b i o u s , it's a difficult point to a r g u e , a n d , a s
she says "I've never even h a d c h i c k e n p o x , m u m p s o r
measles. D o n ' t y o u think those a r e pretty g o o d g e n e s
to pass a l o n g ? " M o r e o v e r , it certainly isn't the m o d e l s
w h o a r e the victims - they get to select the winner,
negotiate contracts a n d d o c t o r s , a n d will k e e p all the
m o n e y f o r themselves (Harris c h a r g e s a n a d d i t i o n a l
2 0 % c o m m i s s i o n o n t o p o f the final fee). Indeed, t h e
site w e l c o m e s a p p l i c a t i o n s f r o m w o u l d - b e d o n o r s -
you just have to b e " y o u n g , beautiful, healthy a n d
intelligent" t o apply.
The Future
In a l l probability, the market ceiling will already have
b e e n r e a c h e d by the time y o u read this, a n d both H a r -
ris a n d his m o d e l s will have m a d e a tidy profit f o r their
endeavour. But whilst they begin to prepare f o r the har-
rowing process that will lead t o them fulfiling their e n d
of the b a r g a i n , he will b e p r e p a r i n g f o r next months
a u c t i o n to g o o n line - this time offering the s p e r m o f
m a l e m o d e l s (at c o n s i d e r a b l y lower prices). M e a n w h i l e
the U S G o v e r n m e n t will begin to rush t h r o u g h the l e g -
islation that m a k e s the entire c o n c e p t illegal. A l l that
remains t o b e seen is whether o r not they c a n d o s o
before s o m e o n e matches m o d e l e g g with m o d e l s p e r m
a n d creates their o w n DIY catwalk child...
