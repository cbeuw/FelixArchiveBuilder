Point
S o m e of y o u m a y have noticed that
I wasn't here last week. G i v i n g m y
social c o n s c i e n c e its a n n u a l outing,
I went up to C a m b r i d g e to deliver a
friendly r a p o n the knuckles a b o u t
the price of C h i n e s e take-aways.
N a t u r a l l y , t h e l o c a l b o b b i e s
repressed m e brutally a n d l o c k e d
me in prison, evidently c o n c e r n e d
for President J i a n g ' s fragile mental
state. Slightly p e e v e d , I returned t o
L o n d o n only to find that after yet
another constitutional rewrite, I C U
has m o d e l l e d itself o n the People's
Republic.
F o l l o w i n g t h e b e n i g n a n d
pleasant rule of President H e l ' a d ,
the c o m m u n i s t s have installed Pres-
ident Ta'sha t o run the People's
U n i o n . (That's not the only c o i n c i -
d e n c e : in 1 9 9 7 , a largely success-
ful, yet tiny c o l o n y w a s c o n s u m e d by
its gigantic n e i g h b o u r a n d c h a n g e d
to a n administrative region). N o w it
w o u l d s e e m that Minister f o r C u l -
ture Jin Q u i n ' t r i is seeking to s u p -
press dissenting voices in the n a m e
of ' T h e People', in o r d e r to establish
his o w n succession t o rule.
H o w very well timed this a l l is.
Last w e e k , t h e g o v e r n m e n t
a n n o u n c e d a bill which will finally
give y o u the right not to read a n y
files that C o l l e g e keeps o n y o u ; last
w e e k , the Foreign O f f i c e instructed
y o u r p o l i c e f o r c e to s u p p r e s s
p e a c e f u l d e m o c r a t i c protest in
order to protect trade; a n d last
w e e k , m e m b e r s of the U n i o n Exec-
utive d e c i d e d t o use their influence
to suppress o p i n i o n s that differed
f r o m their o w n .
Let's m a k e it clear: this c o l u m n
will remain a n o n y m o u s in spite of
pathetic bleating f r o m u n a c c o u n t -
able hacks. Without anonymity, it
c a n n o t b e written. If p e o p l e knew I
wrote Breakpoint, they'd either tell
me nothing, o r tell m e a l o a d of
trash. M a n y letters t o Felix a r e
unsigned, a n d the o p i n i o n s given
are often more sensible than those
of the egotists w h o simply wish t o
see their n a m e in print. This c o l u m n
is subject to the a p p r o v a l of the
Felix Editor, in exactly the s a m e w a y
as a n y letter is. T h e Felix Editor is,
by the way, D a v i d Roberts, not o u r
Minister of C u l t u r e , o r a n y o n e else
for that matter.
For those of y o u unsure, Break-
Point has c o m e a b o u t as a result of
desperation at the apathy s h o w n by
your typical IC student. I C U has
g r e a t p o w e r s a n d i n f l u e n c e at
Imperial, a n d it scares m e to think
of it b e i n g used w i t h o u t o p e n
debate h o l d i n g o u r ' e l e c t e d ' offi-
cers to account. S o Breakpoint aims
to start that d e b a t e , in the lecture
theatres, in Southside a n d the sports
fields. N o leader writer in Fleet
Street signs their c o l u m n s ; if y o u
don't a g r e e with t h e m , y o u either
put up o r shut up. T h e s a m e applies
here.
W h y is it s o important t o know
w h o BreakPoint is? If y o u d i d know,
doubtless the replies t o my c o l u m n
w o u l d not tackle the substance of
the d e b a t e , but merely b e personal
insults - a n d that gets us nowhere
fast.
S o until the editor gives m e my
m a r c h i n g o r d e r s , you'll find m e
here sharing this p a g e with Kevin.
I'll keep raking the lawn a n d reveal-
ing any h i d d e n treasures I m a y find.
For your part, I h o p e y o u keep
r e a d i n g , a n d a i m to discover the
truth f o r yourself.
O h , a n d by the w a y - f o r those
of y o u w h o said m y first c o l u m n
(Felix 1 1 5 2 ) w a s m a d e - u p n o n -
sense, I c o m m e n d y o u to read T i m
Trailor's quote o n last weeks front
p a g e : "There's also a plan to ratio-
nalise the sports g r o u n d s . That s u g -
gests that they plan to sell Tedding-
t o n " . I thank y o u .

Kevin, h o p i n g to find intriguing stories of a n
ingenious theft, c o v e r e d u p by the R C S U h a s
been investigating. T h e best excuse the twenty
t h o u s a n d p o u n d s worth o f t h e r m o m e t e r c o u l d
c o m e u p with, w a s that it w a s a w a y f r o m c o l l e g e
getting p o l i s h e d . Kevin sees this a s a b o u t a s
pathetic as : "Sorry .. I can't c o m e , I'm d o i n g my
hair."
HARD TO COMMENT
The Senior C o m m o n R o o m (SCR), a n d sur-
r o u n d i n g a r e a s o n the first f l o o r of Sherfield a r e
to b e refurbished. Estates h a s expressed c o n c e r n
at the lack of c o m m e n t s o n the plans that they
have received f r o m staff a n d students. Kevin
thinks he m a y have a n e x p l a n a t i o n , other than
typical IC apathy. A t the time o f writing Kevin
notices that e-mails t o s c r c o m m e n t s @ i c . a c . u k ,
the address to which c o m m e n t s were invited, are
b o u n c i n g .
A recent article in staff newsletter ICDistorter
also stated that details c o u l d b e viewed f r o m
www.ad.ic.ac.uk/estates, yet the p a g e is still
awaiting the a p p r o p r i a t e link.
JACK HAMMER ATTACK
Estates have stated that they a r e keen to keep
noise a n d disruption to a m i n i m u m during the
S C R project, which will run f r o m directly after
C h r i s t m a s , to the e n d of June. T h o s e responsible
are evidently a w a r e of fears of a repeat of the
d e b a c l e that a c c o m p a n i e d the Library extension

A Mostly Harmless Column by
Kevin, a random entity who
knows nothing about nothing
w h i c h resulted in students taking exams in a tent
outside Southside a n d have stated that "students
should not fear noise d u r i n g e x a m s " .
To ensure they have evidence t o b a c k u p
their statements contractors with jack h a m m e r s
have b e e n drilling into walls a r o u n d Sherfield t o
see the effect o n the G r e a t Hall. Kevin w a s not
e n c o u r a g e d by the fact lectures in the Reed a n d
Pippard Lecture Theatres were disrupted by nois-
es similar t o jack h a m m e r s d u r i n g the w e e k o f

PRICE WAR HERE WE COME
The I C U run newsagents o n the walkway will
relocate to the J C R t e m p o r a r i l y f r o m January
during the S C R works. Students a n d Staff will b e
f a c e d with a c h o i c e between Q T ' s , a n d the I C U
outlet, which will b e situated o p p o s i t e e a c h
other. Kevin e n c o u r a g e s students to c h o o s e I C U ,
as profits benefit students, rather than being
s w a l l o w e d by Sherfield. T h e U n i o n newsagents is
of course s u p e r i o r to Q T : it will r e m a i n the only
o n e with n e w s p a p e r s a n d m a g a z i n e s , a n d is also
c h e a p e r o n standard lines such as drinks a n d
crisps. " ' . i i S M W S l < i
