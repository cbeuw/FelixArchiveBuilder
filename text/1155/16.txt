Macy Gray
On How Life Is
(Epic)
This is the debut a l b u m from 29-year-old soul singer M a c y Gray, currently
America's "hottest sensation", who's beginning to replicate the attention over
here a n d throughout Europe. H e r unusual voice has mostly been c o m p a r e d
to Billie Holiday, but that implies it to be rather old-fashioned. In truth, there
is also the sound of s o m e o n e like Tina Turner in her '60's heyday. G r a y refus-
es to be pigeonholed but if pushing stupid birds into small openings is your
thing then her music would best be described as raw soul with large chunks
of hip-hop, rock, r 'h b a n d funk thrown in. In short, an eclectic concoction
of beats a n d melodies.
Born with a voice that suggested she was the offspring of Tricky a n d M a r g e
Simpson, she rarely spoke for fear of being teased. It was only after moving
to Los Angeles to join a film school that she began songwriting with friends.
W h e n singers for her songs didn't a p p e a r she was reluctantly roped in..
Musicians hearing the tape were taken by her unique singing voice: equal
parts scat, rap a n d sweet soul. She was snapped up by Epic early last year
a n d was given the unique opportunity of going o n nationwide tours before
the release of any recordings.
Well, that's a nice fairy tale story following the usual rags-to-riches m o u l d ,
but is her a l b u m m u c h c o p ? First track W h y Didn't You C a l l M e sets the scene
nicely - a pleading soul/rock vocal with lush harmonies in the backing vocals
(provided by G r a y herself) over funky hip-hop beats. Whilst the lyrics hint at
desperation, there's a general g o o d vibe running through this song. She turns
as funky as James Brown o n the huge Sex-O-Matic Venus Freak, spitting out
her lustful words like a disgruntled Shirley Bassey. G i v e n that she claims all
her lyrics are based o n personal experiences, the track I've C o m m i t t e d M u r -
der - about killing her boyfriend's boss as revenge for firing him - is more
than a bit worrying. Undoubtedly the album's highlight, however, is her
breakthrough single I Try. Its steady climb into the U K Top Ten proves the
song's lasting a p p e a l . Its style is rather different to other tracks o n O n H o w
Life Is, perhaps because it is o n e of the few songs where G r a y wrote the
music as well as the lyrics. Performed in the m a n n e r of a 7 0 ' s starlet, I Try
swells a n d scrambles its way to a rip-roaring chorus, G r a y battling between
her two vocal tracks as if the g o o d a n d evil in her mind are both trying to
m a k e themselves heard.
If the a l b u m h a d a b a d point it would be that, while each track combines a
variety of styles there is not e n o u g h difference between the actual songs. But
as a debut a l b u m , it is more than sufficient a n d hints at a bright future.

Gabrielle
Rise
(WEA)
This is Gabrielle's third a l b u m a n d defi-
nitely her best. Whilst the first a l b u m c o n -
tained such 'gems' as D r e a m s a n d the sec-
o n d contained nothing m e m o r a b l e at all,
it could never be said that her voice was
anything less than excellent. The third
a l b u m finally sees her mature into the style
that suits her voice best. That style is a
voice-driven crossover between soul a n d
p o p a n d works well for most of the tracks
on this record. A l o n g with these three
albums Gabrielle seems to have under-
gone three image changes to suit the
c h a n g e in style of each. She has moved
from the eyepatched record c o m p a n y driv-
en hard w o m a n n e e d i n g g i m m i c k s ,
through relative 'normality' (= uninspiring)
to where she is now. That place is the very
big haired soul queen look that looks as if
it's modelled o n D i a n a Ross
O n e of the main problems with this a l b u m
is that there is nothing to pick out lyrically
between the tracks - the two variations
seem to be 'we're in love, it's perfect' a n d
'we were in love but n o w we're not a n d it's
your fault1
. While these m a y have their
place in the song-writing world they c a n
be, a n d many times have been, much
more inspiring than the lyrics found here.
However, Gabrielle's voice manages to
drag them from awfulness a n d propel
them towards a height where you can just
about let their crossness slide.
While there is nothing really outstanding
o n this a l b u m the overall quality is g o o d .
Unfortunately when c o m p a r e d to other
records such as that from M a c y G r a y it just
can't hold its a p p e a l a n d is easily eclipsed.
