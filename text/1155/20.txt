Urusei Yatsura
Yon Kyoku In EP
(limit break)
Urusei Yatsura are o n e of
those bands w h o should be
amazingly popular, but no-
one's ever heard of them.
Imagine, if you will, the atmos-
phere in an intimate venue
when this b a n d , the superb
Scottish successor to the Pix-
ies, hits the stage letting fly
with viciously g o o d alternative
rock. The songs Kewpies Like
Watermelon a n d Slain By Elf
have a lyrical sillyness not seen
since Terrorvision's D o g
C h e w e d The H a n d l e , belying
the e m o t i o n a l m e s s a g e
beneath.
This latest EP is all that, yet a
little m o r e - dare I say -
mature? It takes a new direc-
tion like the proverbial fresh
new pair of pants; strange at
first, then just b e c o m e s a part
of y o u . Kaytronica is the first
track a n d the most traditional-
ly Yatsura with s o m e familiar
high pitch t w a n g i n g . Still
Exploding eases us into new
u n e x p l o r e d territory a n d
sounds suspiciously like their
fellow Scots, Idlewild. Next up,
the acoustic, N o b o d y knows
we're Stars is sensitive a n d
mellow, if a little frustrated. W e
finish o n M o t h e r of the M B K , a
very unusual song which c a n
only be described as being
like a superposition (please
don't hit m e , please) of the
other three songs.

Talking All That Jazz
London Jazz Festival -12 to 21 November
You have to a d m i t that jazz is best enjoyed w h e n listened to in a s m a l l ,
noisy, s m o k y c l u b , o v e r c r o w d e d by sexy a n d classy c o u p l e s . However,
s o m e artists' international success m e a n s they c a n only perform in b i g
c o n c e r t halls o n their w o r l d tours; a n d that m e a n s n o a t m o s p h e r e ,
lack of style etc... doesn't it? W e l l , m a y b e not: there w a s a C u b a n
B o n a n z a at the B a r b i c a n H a l l o n Friday 15th with the b a n d s r e s p o n -
sible f o r the s o u n d track of the highly successful film 'Buena Vista
S o c i a l C l u b ' .
They m a y have b e e n a r o u n d 5 0 years o l d o n a v e r a g e , but the music
was f a b u l o u s . T h e rhythms were irresistible a n d most of the c r o w d
progressively started d a n c i n g in the aisles! Furthermore, at the e n d of
the fiesta1
, the b a n d invited s o m e of the c r o w d to d a n c e o n stage. T h e
C u b a n fire h a d sent the B a r b i c a n hall o n a o n e way trip to S a n t i a g o !
This proves that jazz concerts don't have to be r e p e n t a n c e , a n d m o r e
importantly, they're the only w a y to listen to the best musicians alive!
A n d that's not e x a g g e r a t i n g .
That's why y o u s h o u l d try a n d get tickets to s o m e of the acts o n offer
at the L o n d o n Jazz Festival in N o v e m b e r . The Z a w i n u l Syndicate,
B r a n d f o r d M a r s a l i s , D i a n n e Reeves a n d Taj M a h a l are s o m e of the
jazz l e g e n d s c o m i n g to L o n d o n , a n d they will assist British front s c e n e
artists like C o u r t n e y Pine a n d A n d y S h e p p a r d in offering simply the
best jazz concerts y o u c a n get.
T h e t w o acts that will steal the show, a r e : D i a n n e Reeves a n d J o e Z a w -
inul. D i a n n e Reeves is a n o t h e r o n e of these artists w h o c a n set any
c o n c e r t hall o n fire; a n d s o she d i d a year a g o at the Royal Festival
H a l l , p a c k e d with y o u n g b l a c k w o m e n w h o couldn't stop expressing
their love f o r the music. H e r v o i c e is irresistible, her scat i m p r o v i s a -
tions w o u l d m a k e a p a r a l y z e d 90-year-old stand u p a n d d a n c e , a n d
her s o n g s a b o u t fighting f o r survival a n d b e i n g strong m a k e her s h o w
u n m i s s a b l e both f o r the m u s i c a n d for the ideas c o n v e y e d . J o e Z a w -

tric p e r i o d . His m u s i c is very u p b e a t , a n d I p r o m i s e y o u , y o u won't
sleep t h r o u g h that o n e !
These concerts aren't exactly c h e a p , a n d y o u have to b o o k in a d v a n c e
to get the best seats f o r the lowest prices; but n o jazz-fan s h o u l d miss
t h e m . N i c e .
