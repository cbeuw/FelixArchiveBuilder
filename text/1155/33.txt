Despite playing what w a s possibly
o u r worst g a m e in three years, w e
nonetheless destroyed a n o t h e r set
of medics. With a side that consist-
ed of only six of last w e e k ' s starting
line u p w e started with a fresh, if
inexperienced line up. A s the sec-
onds start, it s o o n b e c a m e clear
that even the n e w s e c o n d s side
c o u l d kick s o m e arse even w h e n
they were playing well b e l o w par.
The first try c a m e s o o n after the
whistle with a period of play that
the all-blacks w o u l d have b e e n
p r o u d of, being converted by J i m
S o p p e r under the posts. M o r e
tries c a m e eventually with the sec-
o n d s b e i n g a b o u t 3 5 - 0 u p at half
time.
After a royal roasting the sec-
o n d s d i d not i m p r o v e but still m a n -
a g i n g t o put m a n y tries d o w n u n d e r

not really s h o w the d o m i n a n c e o f

This fatiguing m a t c h e n d e d both
o n e g o a l a p i e c e , a n d o n e dislo-
cated s h o u l d e r a p i e c e at Pad. Rec.
The skill shown by both sides was of
a surprising early season quality,
but the finishing was at times w o e -
ful, culminating in a missed penalty
flick by R U M S in the 65th minute.
I C S M scored first through a
classic p o a c h e r ' s strike f r o m J e z
Boyle, after a short corner break-
d o w n , a n d then wasted a series o f
g o o d opportunities to kill off the
g a m e . After the restart the R U M S '
centre midfield b e g a n t o take a n
o m i n o u s stranglehold o n the mid-
field, until fortuitously f o r I C S M he
dislocated his shoulder, fouling in
centrefield. N o t to b e o u t d o n e ,
N i c k Keysell went a n d p o p p e d his
shoulder out attempting a powerful
c l e a r a n c e , a n d in the ensuing c o n -
f u s i o n N i c k ' s o p p o s i t e n u m b e r
scored with I C S M still in tactical
disarray. A tense 1 5 m i n u t e s
r e m a i n e d as both sides attempted
to spurn a s m a n y c h a n c e s a s p o s -
sible, a n d w h e n the final whistle
blew both t e a m s left t o lick their
w o u n d s a n d rebuke themselves for
their o w n wastefulness in front of

St G e o r g e ' s 1 7
This w a s (yet again) a seriously
close m a t c h .
Tight m a r k i n g f r o m S t . G e o r g e ' s
d e f e n c e (and s o m e d u b i o u s eye
s h a d i n g u n d e r the pretence o f
marking) m e a n t that the IC g o a l
flow was reduced to a few outstand-
ing shots from Rebekah a n d S a r a in
the first half. Paula "the r o a d r u n n e r "
d i d h e r thing, feeding the ball in
a n d a r o u n d the circle to set u p the
shooters, a n d a fired u p Kirstie kept
the St G e o r g e ' s W A well under c o n -
trol. A t half time, the score was 9-9.
A f e w substitutions later a n d
with Becky, the umpire, muttering
" h o w does this pen w o r k ? " the sec-
o n d half got underway to a furious
p a c e . Jess a n d J a n e z o o m e d
a r o u n d the court, a n d the defensive
c o m b i n a t i o n of Alex (occasionally
looking rather surprised w h e n the
ball b o u n c e d in front of her) a n d
Kathryn in the IC circle, kept us in
contention. Things were l o o k i n g u p
with 13mins to g o w h e n the St.
G e o r g e ' s centre twisted h e r ankle
a n d the i c e packs were broken
o p e n . A s St G e o r g e ' s h a d n o s u b -
stitutes, w e took the opportunity t o
try a n d bury h e r under a pile o f
coats u n d e r the pretext of keeping
her w a r m , thus reducing their t e a m
to 6 players. U n f o r t u n a t e l y h e r
team-mates d i d not forget a b o u t
her, a n d h e r injury was not serious
so she w a s a b l e to play o n . In the
dying m o m e n t s o f the g a m e , two
quick-fire g o a l s s a w IC d r a w level
a n d c l a i m a well-deserved draw.

After a p o o r p e r f o r m a n c e in the

the g a m e got underway, with Kings

m i g h t k n o w h o w t o play f o o t b a l l .
W e started badly, c o n c e d i n g
a g o a l early o n , w h e n their striker
(the c o c k i e s t b a s t a r d e v e r k n o w n )
c o l l e c t e d t h e ball a n d sent a l o w
shot into the corner. K i n g s l o o k e d
like a t e a m w h o e x p e c t e d t o w i n
