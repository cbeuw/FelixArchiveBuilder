C o m m e m o r a t i o n D a y p a s s e d off
o n c e a g a i n without a n y real note,
save the a n n u a l invasion of ex-stu-
dents in strange outfits clogging u p
the c a m p u s last Wednesday.
The graduation ceremony, which
c o m m e m o r a t e s the visit of King
G e o r g e VI a n d Q u e e n Elizabeth in
1 9 4 8 to celebrate the centenary of
the Royal S c h o o l of Chemistry,
passed off without a hitch, a n d w a s if
anything slightly shorter than last
year's p r o g r a m m e . A s well as the
1 3 0 0 o r s o graduates w h o were
p a r a d e d in front of the C h a i r m a n of
G o v e n o r s , the afternoon also includ-
ed the presentation of four new H o n -
orary C o l l e g e Fellows, a n d the c o m -
m e m o r a t i o n of the fiftieth anniversary
of the foundation of the C o l l e g e
Choir.
The d a y culminated with the
C o m m e m o r a t i o n Ball, organised for
This year's graduate await their fifteen minutes of fame Photo: Jonas
the g r a d u a t e s by the U n i o n .
A l t h o u g h this t o o passed without any
notable incident it could prove m e m -
orable in future years as the last ever
Ball of it's type. A thorough review is
currently u n d e r w a y t o e x a m i n e
whether the U n i o n c a n truly support
both this event a n d the S u m m e r Ball
(for more details see this week's State
of the U n i o n o n p a g e 9).
In Brief
C H A R I N G C R O S S SALE
Rumours have b e e n flying r o u n d the
office' of U n i o n hacks all week
r e g a r d i n g a possible shake u p at
C h a r i n g C r o s s library.
A l t h o u g h nothing concrete has
b e e n said the official line is that the
a d m i n i s t r a t i o n a r e " r e v i e w i n g
s p a c e " with a possible view to m o v -
ing t w o floors of journals a n d peri-
o d i c a l s d o w n t o the basement of the
m a i n building into the s p a c e that is
currently o c c u p i e d by the U n i o n .
Primary C a r e w o u l d most likely
take over the s p a c e left.
N a t a s h a N e w t o n , U n i o n Presi-
dent, a n d Becky E n g l a n d , I C S M S U
President, a r e p l a n n i n g to meet with
the administration at C h a r i n g X o n
the 2 9 t h to get a better i d e a of what
is h a p p e n i n g .
It is unlikely that either St M a r y ' s

librarys will b e subjected t o similar
reviews.
WAIVERS WAR
A c c o r d i n g t o the A U T last M o n d a y
was a W O W day. It formed part of
the c a m p a i g n against university staff
having to routinely sign a w a y their

A c t 1 9 9 9 . T h e A U T h a v e n o w
pushed for current waivers signed
by staff to b e r e v o k e d . T h e general
secretary of the A s s o c i a t i o n c o m -
mented "This is a n issue of fairness.
N o staff in H i g h e r E d u c a t i o n s h o u l d

C & G U NIGHT B O M B S
City & G u i l d s U n i o n held their
t h e m e d Star W a r s night last Friday
in the J C R . It w a s intended to
replace last year's b o a t party w h i c h
f l o p p e d in spectacular fashion. T h e
e n g i n e e r s o r g a n i s e d a c a s i n o ,
d i s c o , b a r a n d a b i g screen playing
the entire series of Lucas' s p a c e

e s q u e m i s q u o t e s the event w a s
reported to have f l o p p e d with only
3 5 - 4 0 p e o p l e t u r n i n g u p . T h e
C & G U President, D i n e s h G a n e -
sarajah, admitted the event h a d
m a d e a loss of £ 3 6 6 , a n d c o u l d
offer n o explanation f o r the l o w
turnout. H e d i d n o t think the £ 5
ticket price o r the high male-female
ratio in G u i l d s w a s to b l a m e a n d
a d d e d that t h e p e o p l e present
s e e m e d to have enjoyed the night.
" W e m a y have suffered a m i n o r
setback, but it is hardly significant in
view of C & G U ' s largest venture this
term, the Freshers D i n n e r " c o m -
m e n t e d M r . G a n e s a r a j a h . "This
event h a s a strong reputation a n d is
a perfect introduction to this U n i o n .
I a m confident w e will n o t see a
repeat o f the Stars W a r s night a n d
the pre-sale b o o k i n g s a r e giving
early i n d i c a t i o n o f yet a n o t h e r
storming night."
A C C E S S T O W O R K
The restrictions o n international stu-
