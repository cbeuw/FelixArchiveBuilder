Arthurian l e g e n d has recently fallen into disrepute. A s perhaps o n e of the m o r e easily a c c e s s e d stories of
English/Celtic myth it h a s in turns b e e n r o m a n t i c i s e d , demythici se d, oversimplified a n d used as f o d d e r f o r Saturday
afternoon television. A n d o n a less innocent note I c a n say that the n a m e Lancelot has b e c o m e s y n o n y m o u s with tel-
evision p r o g r a m m e s involving a cringeworthy plot a n d ladies of a d u b i o u s nature.
Yet I have p l a c e d myself in the uncertain position of trying to p e r s u a d e other p e o p l e to read The O n c e a n d Future
King w h i c h is u n d e n i a b l y a classic novel d e a l i n g with the Arthurian cycle, 'King Arthur a n d the Knights of the R o u n d
Table' f o r those less enthusiastic than m e .
It is essentially a quartet of b o o k s of w h i c h the first, T h e S w o r d in the Stone is probably the best k n o w n - p e r h a p s
through the a n i m a t e d version released several years a g o if not in the written f o r m . The Sword in the Stone is a b e a u -
tiful tale. T h e characters a r e defined a n d d e s c r i b e d in a l m o s t completely h u m o u r o u s terms a n d that h u m o u r is w o n -
derfully English. O f the w h o l e quartet this section is the lightest in tone a n d cheerfullest in subject matter; the tale of
a small boy, affectionately k n o w n as the W a r t , g r o w i n g u p in a fantastic e n v i r o n m e n t u n a w a r e that he is o n e d a y to
be the K i n g . It m a y s o u n d s i m p l e , it m a y even s o u n d pretentious, but the writing is so detailed a n d so entertaining
that a n o l d e r r e a d e r c a n find i m m e n s e satisfaction in it.
It is not a realistic tale in a n y sense of the w o r d ; situations a r e fanciful a n d imaginative in the extreme, except per-
haps f o r the r a n d o m lectures' o n h o w heavy a r m o u r really w a s in the o l d days a n d h o w that restricted the p a c e of a
duel. T h e p r o b l e m s that the W a r t encounters a s he grows u p tend to be of the p h i l o s o p h i c a l a n d theoretical kind rather
than rude a n d d a m a g i n g encounters with the harshness of life.
But this m a k e s f o r a n innocent, light, wonderfully sentimental, sit-by-the-fire-and-munch-Christmas p u d type r e a d .
W h i c h is never a b a d thing, n o matter what the literary types say.
The other three b o o k s c o n t a i n e d within The O n c e a n d Future King deal with the m a i n characters a n d the events l e a d -
ing up to the destruction of the R o u n d Table a n d the death of Arthur. C o n s e q u e n t l y these b o o k s d o not have the bright
cheerfulness that is inherent in T h e S w o r d in the Stone. A s adults the characters are a l l o w e d to have m o r e c o m p l e x
e m o t i o n s a n d t o therefore exist in a m u c h m o r e c o m p l i c a t e d w o r l d . A l l except f o r Arthur that is, w h o retains the sim-
ple e m o t i o n s a n d idealisations of his c h i l d h o o d . This is where the novel as a w h o l e d e v e l o p s its pathos. The central
character has the i n n o c e n c e of a stereotypical child whilst all the characters s u r r o u n d i n g h i m a r e involved in s o m e
s c h e m e o r plot. W h a t I love a b o u t these three b o o k s is that the author d o e s not d e a l t o o harshly with the 'bad' c h a r -
acters; he shows t h e m to b e h u m a n , that a n y o n e c o u l d m a k e the mistakes that these characters m a k e .
I r e c o m m e n d this to those w h o love r e a d i n g a b o u t different p e o p l e , to those w h o love myths, to those w h o want to
lose themselves f o r a little while in a w o r l d that is nicer than IC, a n d to those with lots of work to d o .
