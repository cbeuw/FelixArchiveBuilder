The State of the Union
Aldwych
There are 1 9 top Universities in the
country, called the Russell g r o u p .
Those Universities have 1 9 U n i o n s ,
called the A l d w y c h g r o u p . A l d w y c h
was set u p to fight fees. A s the top
Universities w e a r e most at risk of
extra charges (top u p fees) because
p e o p l e will p a y extra f o r a better
degree. A s o n e of the Presidents
which m a k e up the g r o u p , I a m o n
the look up for hidden course costs.
If y o u think that y o u a r e being
c h a r g e d extra c o m e a n d see m e o r
the D P E&W, Kevin Butcher. Thus far
Imperial has been playing very fair,
(would w e expect anything differ-
ent?) but C a m b r i d g e have h a d a
3 5 % increase in Hall rents, s o m e
places are being c h a r g e d for h a n d -
outs or even to g o to their o w n g r a d -
uation!!
Up for grabs
There are still a few 'elected' places
o p e n for U n i o n committees. H a v e a
look o n the notice b o a r d outside the
U D H . M o s t of them m e a n n o work
on your part, just a c h a n c e to see the
inner workings o f I C U . S u m m e r Ball

Final years
The c o m m e m o r a t i o n d a y Ball has
b e e n a n a n n u a l event for years a n d
years. Recently it has been poorly
attended a s people chose to say bye
bye t o their year g r o u p at the S u m -
mer Ball rather than o n graduation
day. For the last two years the n u m -
bers have g o n e d o w n a n d d o w n a n d
now it looks totally unviable. BUT, I
didn't think it was fair to bin it for you
o n the basis of what this year's guys
have d o n e . . . . s o this is h o w it
works. There will be a n I C U s u m m e r
ball this a c a d e m i c year (with tickets
as close to £55 as possible). D o you
think there should then be a late
O c t o b e r ball for your year? (Again
a r o u n d £55.)
