The Charlatans
Us and Us Only
(Universal)
Us and Us Only is the follow u p
to the excellent Telliri Stories
a l b u m . The Charlatans are sur-
prisingly the only real survivors of
the M a n c h e s t e r scene (which
included the Stone Roses a n d
the H a p p y Mondays), s o m e -
thing that is reflected in the c o n -
fidence of the album's title.
While a number of the songs,
like A House Is Not A Home
quite strongly recall their earlier
material (in this case the country
rock of North Country Boy), this
is not necessarily such a b a d
thing. Indeed, there are also
more b o l d , experimental tracks
not least the mightily impressive
single, Forever. Building slowly
from a bass-led intro into a great
universal love song, it is o n e of
the best songs they have record-
ed. It brings to mind the Stones
a n d Primal S c r e a m , yet still
maintains their fairly unique
sound of guitars blending s e a m -
lessly with H a m m o n d grooves.
O n e grumble is perhaps that the
majority of the songs are a little
too d o w n tempo. There also
aren't really any obvious singles
in the vein of say O n e To Anoth-
er. Yet, while many of their more
illustrious peers have either
faded o r are stumbling (e.g. the
Roses a n d Oasis), the C h a r l a -
tans continue to consistently pro-
duce g o o d albums.

Death in Vegas
Interview-A Chat With Tim
Death in Vegas's recent a l b u m , The C o n t i n o Sessions, was a delicious
mixed b a g of surprises. Their association with the Heavenly label a n d club
nights would probably lead o n e to expect a nice poppy a l b u m full of
dancey tracks a n d a real feel g o o d factor. O n listening though, The C o n -
tino Sessions is far from a p o p record, Tim from the band explained when
Felix writer Boycey h a d a quick chat with him last week...
Boycey: S o what's all this Heveanly Social, big beat stuff about? It seems
to m e that you boys have more than just a few musical sounds influencing
your beats. Please explain.
Tim: The Heavenly Social was never about big beat music. The music p o l -
icy w a s to play g o o d music of any genre as long as it was g o o d . There
was house, rap, soul, indie, absolutely anything. Those club nights were
brilliant. S o m e of the DJs at the Big Beat Boutique club in Brighton h a d a
similar policy so I suppose that was where the association started. Big beat
music is music by numbers though. Pretty much in o n e ear a n d out the
other. Anyone could make a n okay big beat track with a few hours o n a
g o o d computer. With Death in Vegas, myself a n d Richard try to d o quite
a bit more. W e trying to make music that pushes back barriers. I'm thirty
eight a n d Richard is late twenties so we've been around for a while
Boycey: Thirty-eight? That's quite old for a p o p star.
Tim: I've d o n e a lot of different things in my time, a n d my experiences have
c h a n g e d m e a lot. I used to want to be a fish farmer, a n d then some work
experience showed m e that fish farmers were all Barbour wearing upper
class tossers. I've also lived a few years of hedonism a n d b e d l a m . I used
to m a k e regular trips to A m s t e r d a m , a n d although I've c a l m e d d o w n a lot,
I still think the place is great. I love little picturesque European cities.
Boycey: S o will o n e ot these cities be your choice for your m a d millenium
party, o r will you b e DJing around the world?
Tim: There's this little island just off the west coast of Scotland called Beaut,
a n d I think I'll be there with a few close friends. I can't be arsed with m a k -
ing a big deal of it so I'm opting out. I suppose it's my a g e again. I'm not
boring really! It's also just after the tour we're d o i n g so it will b e g o o d to
be able to relax
Boycey : A n d finally before w e run out of space, it's Felix cheesy question
time W e all know that there ain't n o party like a n S-Club Party, so w h o
w o u l d it b e Rachel, H a n n a h , J o o r the other one?
Tim: Sorry mate, I haven't got a clue what you're o n about.
