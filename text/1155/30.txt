At first thought, it all seems rather
m a d : piling into a minibus o n a
cold Friday night, b o m b i n g u p t h e
M l for a c o u p l e of hours a n d then
w a n d e r i n g into a field, at midnight,
with a torch as your only light
source in which t o pitch a tent!
O k a y , s o it is m a d , but w h y not?
O h , a n d the r e a s o n for this? To get
two a w e s o m e days, c l i m b i n g the
gritstone crags of the Peak District.
As a relative novice to the w o r l d o f
rock c l i m b i n g , I wasn't quite sure
what to expect, but just the thought
of leaving L o n d o n for the w e e k e n d
was reason e n o u g h t o g o . W a k i n g
up o n Saturday m o r n i n g t o the
s o u n d of whistling birds rather than
rush-hour traffic, with the c r a g only
a f e w minutes away, I w a s c o n -
vinced I h a d m a d e the right d e c i -
sion!
With all t h e banter f r o m m o r e
experienced club m e m b e r s a b o u t
past triumphs a n d plans for the day,
I w o n d e r e d if it w o u l d b e possible
to c l i m b anything without l o o k i n g
totally pathetic. T h e skill of these
p e o p l e , however, m e a n s that o n e is
a b l e t o d e v e l o p at their o w n p a c e
in a relaxed a n d safe environment.
W e were very lucky as there w a s n o
rain a l l w e e k e n d , with the a d d e d
b o n u s of s u n o n Sunday, m a k i n g
those first moves even m o r e enjoy-
a b l e !
Returning to L o n d o n o n Sunday
night, I felt refreshed, albeit tired,
a n d ready t o take o n those 9 a m
lectures! It w a s certainly o n e of the
best w e e k e n d s I've h a d in two years
of being at Imperial.
As well a s these trips, which a r e
run every other w e e k e n d , the club
visits a L o n d o n c l i m b i n g wall every
W e d n e s d a y . This is where I d i d my
first c l i m b , a n d a l t h o u g h o u t d o o r
c l i m b i n g is a different g a m e to wall
c l i m b i n g , it is a n excellent w a y of
seeing what c l i m b i n g is all a b o u t ,
without the c o m m i t m e n t of a w h o l e
w e e k e n d away. C l i m b i n g walls
a l s o help y o u to improve your tech-
nique, whether y o u decide to g o
