V H A T ' S A N EDITOPIAI I
N o r m a l l y an editorial is a chti
to reflect u p o n tfiose issues rai
within the p a g e s of the p u b l i
tion a n d use ihis position of p
sections 1 hat the true b a r g a i n s

pii k up d e c e n t ( fj's fot a b o u t € 3
d u e to the b l a n k e t p r i c i n g policy.
H o w e v e t it varies f r o m o n e s h o p
to a n o t h e r a n d I have p e r s o n a l l y
p i c k e d u p " T h e C u l t of Ant a n d
[)( c" for only ' ., as!
V i d e o s a r e similarly p r i c e d and;:
this is a g o o d p l a c e to pick up all
nalism in an attempt to write well-
b a l a n c e d informative pieces.
You refuse to n a m e the writer of
BreakPoint because " n o self-respect-
ing Editor...would deliberately reveal
the identity of a n a n o n y m o u s
source...as it w o u l d irrevocably d a m -
a g e the ability of the writers to collect
i n f o r m a t i o n if their identity was
known". O h , c o m e o n . Its hardly
M I 5 . I'm sure your ' b l o w i n g their
cover' will not result in them being
captured a n d tortured with pliers
until they reveal government secrets.
I assure you that we won't send the
heavies to d o them over. W e w o u l d
just like to see which pathetic little
creature it is that goes round p e d -
dling half-truths a n d p r o p a g a n d a .
I seem to recall that M i s h - M a s h
was o n c e a c c o m p a n i e d by s o m e
weird looking kid with glasses. W h o
is he? I assume he is not a m e d i c so
why is he at C h a r i n g Cross for lec-
tures? N o n e of us bother g o i n g . I
find his c o n d e s c e n d i n g tone to be
highly irritating a n d his use of words
such as 'rowdy w a n n a b e doctors'
annoying. The vast majority of us
ARE g o i n g to be doctors. I take it that
he has s o m e future plans too, in
which case he must be a snide
w a n n a b e something-or -other.
I a m glad that Tim Trailor is stick-
ing to his word in trying to keep
B U S A hybrid entry a n d to prevent the
sale of Teddington.Hybrid entry (or
dual entry if it c o m e s to that) is
essential as otherwise we will e n d
with a few elite teams playing o n a
W e d n e s d a y whilst those w h o d o not
m a k e the cut kick their heels. C a n I
remind B U S A about "sport for all"?
G i v e n that the proceeds of the
'secret' sale of Teddington will be
insufficient to help fund the Sports
Centre, c a n I propose an alternative.
In 5 years the gravel extraction at
Harlington will be complete , freeing
up g o d knows how many lucrative
acres in a perfect development spot
for Heathrow Terminal Five. This will
sell for many, many times what we
w o u l d get for Teddington. There is
r o o m e n o u g h for all IC a n d I C S M
sports teams at C o b h a m as G K T are
leaving. Therefore, we should use
reserves for the m o m e n t then sell
Harlington, keep Teddington, get a
new Sports Centre a n d all move to
C o b h a m .
Everyone's a winner.

D e a r D a v e ,
This w e e k , I f o u n d myself in
n e e d of a textbook. Despite there
being a " c o n v e n i e n t " b r a n c h of
Waterstones located o n c a m p u s , I
find buying textbooks a frustrating
a n d t i r e s o m e e x p e r i e n c e . W h y ?
B e c a u s e m o r e often t h a n not,
Waterstones d o not stock the b o o k s
I require - there is nothing p e c u l i a r
a b o u t these b o o k s ; i n d e e d they are
top o n my d e p a r t m e n t ' s list of pre-
scribed texts a n d have b e e n for
m a n y years. M o r e o v e r , ordering a
b o o k f r o m Waterstones only a d d s
t o the frustration, a n d on two o c c a -
sions previously, it took over a
month for them to obtain a single
c o p y of a well-known a n d p o p u l a r
textbook.
The o l d I C U b o o k - s h o p ' g u a r -
a n t e e d * to stock *every* textbook
prescribed by all a c a d e m i c d e p a r t -
ments at Imperial, a n d w h a t d o
Waterstones offer? A mish-mash of
" t r e n d y " novels a n d " T h e Joint-
Rolling H a n d b o o k " - a pathetic
a n d patronising attempt to w o o
students, a n d highly i n a p p r o p r i a t e ,
given c o l l e g e ' s zero-tolerance p o l -
icy towards drugs.
Whilst there is m u c h s c o p e for
private e n t e r p r i s e o n c a m p u s ,
m a n y thought it crass to scrap the
I C U B o o k - s h o p , which h a d b e e n
p r o v i d i ng a reliable a n d efficient
service to students for years. Two
years after o p e n i n g , Waterstones
have still not l e a r n e d f r o m their
mistakes, a n d continue to provide
a second-rate service.

A N D FINALLY...
D e a r Sir,
I a m disturbed to notice that,
as yet, you d o not s e e m to have
published a single article p r o m o t -
ing the legalisation of c a n n a b i s .
Based o n the content of previous
years I h a d c o m e to believe that
legalisation w a s a key Felix policy.
