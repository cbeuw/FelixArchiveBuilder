Robbie Williams
She's The One / It's
Only Us
Recently R o b b i e has
mostly been headlining
stadiums - h o w did that
h a p p e n ? O f this double
A side, It's Only Us is just
average, but She's The
One is a n infectious,
piano-led love song in
the Angels vein, which,
while hardly essential lis-
tening, will please his
fans even more than a
cancelled lecture would
your average IC student.
Ocean Colour Scene
So Low
(Island)
S o L o w finds the O c e a n C o l o u r
S c e n e boys clearly in b a l l a d m o d e .
W h i l e personally I prefer them w h e n
they cut l o o s e , like o n Hundred Mile
High City, this is a well written s o n g
with n i c e v o c a l h a r m o n i e s a n d
understated guitars. They've s h o w n
in the past t h o u g h that they're c a p a -
ble of d o i n g this type of s o n g far bet-
ter than this, so a bit of a d i s a p p o i n t -
ment all told.

Dollars in the heavens
(Nude)
G e n e v a return after a two year hiatus
with another trademark soaring epic.
The f a m i l i a r ingredients of c h o r a l
vocals, high production values, a n d
shimmering celestial guitars c o m b i n e to
create a moving a n d thoughtful racket.
Musically Dollars In The Heavens is not
a million miles from early Suede, but
whilst their label mates peddle the
sound of the gutter, G e n e v a bring us
something a bit more stellar.

Pull Together
(Destiny)
A clear single of the week
for me. Taken from the
rather wonderful HMS
Fable, Pull Together is a
stirring, anthemic s o n g
with a great sentiment of
taking o n the world
together. It's the kind of
s o n g that b a n d s like
O C S , w h o they are sup-
porting, would kill to write
Inhale
Feed
(Jam Inc)
From the m o m e n t y o u
hear the o p e n i n g riff
you k n o w what you're
in for with this - angst
rock. W h i l e they m a y
a d d s o m e keyboards to
the m i x , there's n o
d e n y i n g that Inhale
basically try poorly to
replicate the likes of
N i r v a n a a n d R a d i o -
h e a d but w i t h o u t
a d d i n g a n y t h i n g of
their o w n . U n i n s p i r i n g .
The Lightning Seeds
Life's Too Short
(Epic)
A d e e p l y unethical experiment by M r
B r o u d i e , in which he sees fit to infect
o n e of his i n f a m o u s p o p c h o o n s
with the virus of disco. T h e result is
a p r e d i c t a b l y slick a n d s o u l l e s s
p r o d u c t in w h i c h the great sage
o p e n s o u r m i n d s to his take o n life
the universe a n d everything. W a r n -
ing: those possessing a c o n v e n t i o n -
al m o r a l o u t l o o k m a y be o f f e n d e d
' by the unsettling subtext of incestu-
ous buggery.

In which M o r g a n m a n a g e s to stuff a
fair plethora of ideas into less than
three minutes. Strange C a r i b b e a n
flavoured o r g a n work u n d e r p i n n e d
by s o m e suitably laid-back beats -
o n t o p we get the musings of little
M o r g a n junior. M o r g a n sees fit to
throw in bits of brass, strings, stutter-
ing guitar, a n d unidentifiable e le c-
tronic n o i s e w h e n a p p r o p r i a t e .
M o s t pleasingly of a l l , he finds r o o m
for pseudo-theremin m e a n d e r i n g s
a n d a worthy bassline.
Stereosister
Shamefaced
(Freakout records)
If this b a n d were play-
ing in a p u b they c o u l d
be forgiven as a b u n c h
of b l o k e s h a v i n g a
l a u g h . Unfortunately,
as s o m e c o k e d - u p
r e c o r d e x e c u t i v e h a s
d e c i d e d to unleash their
artistic o u t p u t o n a
weary p u b l i c I feel it my
duty to provide a w a r n -
ing. D o not u n d e r any
circumstances buy this
insipid, m o r o n i c , deriv-
ative wa nk . Like the
Seahorses c o v e r i n g the
Wonderstuff.
