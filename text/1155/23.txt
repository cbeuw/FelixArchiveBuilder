Bela Lugosi's suave p e r f o r m a n c e in the 1 931 film of
D r a c u l a is widely c o n s i d e r e d to be the classic inter-
pretation of B r a m Stoker's b l o o d s u c k e r C o u n t .
Technical limitations of the time m e a n t that this early
'talkie' l a c k e d a score. N o w , two of the l e a d i n g fig-
ures in c o n t e m p o r a r y m u s i c , the K r o n o s Q u a r t e t

rectify this a n o m a l y .
Reviews of the C D of this n e w s o u n d t r a c k have b e e n
s o m e w h a t l u k e w a r m ; the music suffers f r o m G l a s s '
tendency to re-use a n d recycle t h e m e s f r o m earlier
works - in this case, his previous string quartets.
This isn't entirely a b a d thing, as his string quartets
are exceedingly fine pieces of music: n e w listeners
certainly won't suffer. F o r those with previous e x p e -
rience of G l a s s ' m u s i c , however, the s o u n d t r a c k

which the film is projected. As the lighting that falls

ity, like ghosts in the b a c k g r o u n d of the film. Ifs a
stunningly a t m o s p h e r i c effect that never intrudes
u p o n the film, only a d d s to it.
Ifs in this context that the music c o m e s into its o w n .
Superbly p e r f o r m e d , it g o e s a l o n g w a y to restoring
s o m e of the a t m o s p h e r e of darkness the film must

the film are m o r e a m u s i n g than 'horrific' f o r a m o d -
ern a u d i e n c e , G l a s s ' score provides a deliciously

Think of M o h a m m a d Ali, think of the greatest boxing legend that
ever reigned in the seventies. A m a n full of 'cocksure a r r o g a n c e '
but 'heartening humility', he often predicted which rounds he
was g o i n g to win his fights. His fights were not only entertaining
but also resourceful to the young boxing generation of that time.
Then, every kid in the block wanted to box like Ali. They bought
every souvenir of him a n d a lot of them even signed up for a m a -
teur boxing, but unfortunately never m a d e it pro.
Every o n e of his fights was often preceded by a great deal of
s h o w m a n s h i p a n d Ali was always at the centre of it all. This influ-
ence alone m a d e his fights more captivating as millions w o r l d -
wide turn o n their screens to see Ali live up to his promise. H e
rarely disappointed, often winning in a unique fashion. This
could never have been truer than in Zaire in O c t o b e r 1 9 7 4
when Ali fought a n d beat G e o r g e Foreman with a technical
knockout in round eight. After watching a replay of that fight o n
the ' b i g ' screens of Proud Galleries, to say that I was flabber-
gasted w o u l d be a n understatement. W h e n he claimed to 'float
like a butterfly, sting like a b e e ' few could argue.
That was the legendary Rumble in the Jungle. I have never seen
a pro box with so m u c h skill, speed a n d power, but more i m p o r -
tantly, with intelligence against a more daunting opponent. A fact
that w o u l d m a k e M i k e Tyson quite jealous.
M a n y w h o know him well c o m m e n d e d his 'heartening humility',
his ' a m a z i n g sense of h u m o u r ' a n d his 'artistic ability'. A great
inspiration to many, of w h o m was photographer David King.
'Let's get this straight (folks),' said King in a recent interview, ' I
was not interested in boxing. I was interested in A l i . His ability
transcended boxing.' King's 2 5 black a n d white photographs
captured Ali in training in the Pennsylvania mountains before that
legendary fight that many critics regard as the most crucial fight
of his career. All the pictures are signed, dated a n d n u m b e r e d
