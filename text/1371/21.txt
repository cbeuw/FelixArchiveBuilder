Wandering in a windy wonderland
The trip began on a Friday with the
group splitting in twain to travel at
different times to Snowdonia. The
second bus started out late but due
to some skilled driving by the big
man himself (Tim) good time was
made and the first bus was left eat-
ing the dust of his passing. Dinner
was served in typical style at KFC
– a good lining of grease is an im-
portant start to the weekend.
Something was going far too
smoothly however and the fickle
God of fellwanderers trips decided
to have his way. Kathrin, now driv-
ing the second bus, fell foul as the
old banger started to protest under
the pedals. A short delay ensued
with all the wanderers meeting at
the ‘Dobbies Garden World’ island
to exchange thoughts. “It’s obvi-
ously the engine misfiring”, said
Tim and Dave, “A diesel can’t mis-
fire”, said Nathaniel.
Meanwhile, Kathrin was having
‘a bit of a mare’ as she proceeded
to jam the bus keys in the fuel cap.
Cue more frustration and it looking
like it was going to be one of those
weekends. However, in the end it all
sorted itself out, and after a hasty
call to the RAC they were on their
way again.
Obviously the intrepid travellers
had eventually made their way to
St Mary’s Hut in Snowdonia and
awoke early on Saturday, hungry
for some walking and a vegan brek-
kie. The wind was blowing an abso-
lute hoolie, and so some of the more
technical walks were put aside, and
a simpler walk up the Pyg Track to
Snowdon became the favoured op-
tion for the day.
Setting out from the car park (SH
647 556), the weather looked fine
if a little breezy (hurricane speed
winds for sure – it was gusting 100
at Pen-y-Pass) and the group were
wrapped up warm and in high spir-
it. The track was clear and some
of the party took the alternative
‘more interesting’ routes on offer,
with some decent scrambling led
by Nathaniel. Eventually after a se-
date trek uphill the party closed on
the peak, a break was had to wrap
up and the summit was braved.
The effect of the howling wind was
quickly felt; those actually attempt-
ing to climb to the very peak clung
on for grim death while the others
coped with the icy conditions that
had overtaken the mountain in light
of the severe wind chill. Andy did a
good job of weighing Evelyne down
as the wind threatened to pick her
off her feet.
Rather surprisingly lunch was
had on the summit. However, Alex
soon lost the feeling in his fingers,
and Chris’ gentlemanly offer of a
warm cup of coffee went awry when
the wind blew it into Sarah’s face.
Needless to say the party layered
up yet again and the majority, mi-
nus Andy, Kathrin and Chris who
went back to the minibuses, set off
down the hill fairly quickly on the
Snowdon Ranger Path, Dave taking
time to test out his new trekking
poles. Taking the southerly path
(SH 573 552) to Glan-yr-Afon (SH
571 541), heading west to the A4085,
and turning south again for a swift
marching along the road to the pub
at Rhyd-Ddu, where we met up with
Andy, and not long after Kathrin and
Chris who took the wrong turning!
The evening was one of strange
games, allergic reactions and
drunken debauchery. After a brief
stop at the local, Tim, Sarah and
Chris handled the cooking of a
pasta dinner coming in three sepa-
rate varieties: veggie, vegan and
carnivorous.
Pints of dirty cheap wine were the
order of the day and the evening
started out in earnest with a de-
cent fire started by Nathaniel, who
made a good effort as he had only
wet wood to work with. A game of
‘Werewolf’ then began.
A vicious psychological battle en-
sued in which the villagers won af-
ter Dave sold out his mate Alex to
the mob. At this point Tim’s stom-
ach decided to take offence to the
most inoffensive of fungi, the hum-
ble Quorn worked its terrible magic
and the evening ended with every-
one settling down to bed.
Disaster! A severe drought of
bread struck the hut! Andy left on a
bold rescue mission early the next
morning to find a Welshman stupid
enough to open up that early on a
Sunday. Fortunately, baked produce
was soon secured and with the eas-
ing of Tim’s stomach the day took
a turn for the better and the group
decided to attack Cnicht. Some
spectacular views were seen (check
out the photos) and yet again it was
exceptionally windy.
The day had its ups and downs,
the wind taking its toll but all the
scrambling and stunning land-
scapes more than making up for it.
The fellwanderers set out from the
car park at Croesor, northwest up
a track onto the northeasterly path
(SH 628 450) to the summit, taking
the path to the right at SH 632 455.
However, the best thing was the
snow on the peak, its discovery set
the trip back a good half hour as
everyone stopped to have a good
ole’ snowball fight. Chris caught a
few in the face as he, Dave and Alex
declared an all out war.
Heading over the summit and
along the path, turning southeast
at SH 657 477. Lunch was had in
a picturesque, crumbling mining
village (SH 665 462) in the depths
of Wales. The descent back to the
buses started with a good scram-
ble down to a southwesterly path
off the disused rail track (SH 661
462), Nathaniel choosing to ignore
the bridge a few feet in front of him
in favour of leading the group down
one his infamous ‘more interesting
routes’ – risk of death/scoring fall
over points included or your money
back.
The walk down to the buses
passed without incident. The wan-
derers turned to the west through a
field (SH 643 452) and down a track
onto the road back to the car park.
The trip ended with a traditional
teatime stop off in Gaydon to relax
and enjoy a decent pub dinner at
The Malt Shovel Inn. Again good
time was made by Tim in the driv-
ing seat to ensure Alex only had to
stay up till 3:30 to (nearly) finish his
reports for the next day.
