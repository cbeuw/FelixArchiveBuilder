RAG Week 2007 rag@imperial.ac.uk
watering holes of South Kensing-
ton.. Both ladies and gents score-
cards will be provided for a £1 entry
fee. If you are a seasoned veteran
you may wish to embark on ‘The
Championship Course” although
most will find this too challenging.
Meet in the Union Bar at 7pm on
Tuesday
London Invasion
This is the main event of RAG week
and has traditionally been our big-
gest fundraiser. Bring a team of
friends along to Beit Quad at 12 and
the RAG Committee will equip you
with t-shirts, collecting tins and a
list of comical tasks for you to per-
form at some of London’t most fa-
mous landmarks.
Prizes will be awarded for best
fundraisers, best costume and
(most prestigiously) the wackiest
stunt captured on camera. Previ-
ous years have seen brave RAG
volunteers in the fountains at Tra-
falgar Square, busk outside Parlia-
ment and (in one extreme case)
streak bollock naked through the
Bank of England. You can make this
day into anything you want. Wheth-
er you want to indulge in the more
extreme activities or just spend the
day trapsing from pub to pub, you’ll
find something that suits you and
raise a hell of a lot of money from
bemused tourists and city suits.
CGCU Slave Auction
Do you think Felix has been shit?
Then why not buy the Editor. Hate
the sabbaticals? Then exact your
revenge by bidding for them and
making them perform menial tasks.
Alternatively, if you want to nomi-
nate any of your friends (with or
without their permission) contact
our good friends in the CGCU office
in the Mech Eng building. Starts
Union Bar from 7pm onwards.
All Week
Do you despair about the excessive
levels of political correctness that
has infiltrated all levels of British
society? Then buy the RAG Mag!
Our annual pisstake magazine will
be on sale around campus during
RAG week.
RCSU Queens Tower Tours will
be taking place every lunchtime,
12-2pm
RCSU Blind Date
Monday 5th February sees the rec-
reation of the legend that is Blind
Date! It involves a single guy choos-
ing a person to date from 3 single
girls and vice versa. But it’s not that
simple; the guy can’t see the girls
and has to ask them 3 questions, he
then makes his decision based on
the answers he receives. The cou-
ple are then sent on a date at a res-
taurant and we’ll have a follow up
feature in the RCSU’s Broadsheet
to see how they got on (or didn’t!).
We have a set of love-less Imperial
students all eager to win that sort
after free date, so come along and
watch!! To top the night off there
will be a Traffic Light party after-
wards with a DJ and everything!
Traffic Light means you wear red
if you’re taken, yellow/orange if you
are ‘easily swayed’ and green if you
are single. We will be handing out
stickers if you don’t have any status
proclaiming attire!! Doors will open
at 7pm (so get there early if you
want a good seat!) and £2 door fee
goes to RAG and gets you a FREE
DRINK TOKEN! So in the good
words of Cilla Black: Taraa Taraa!!
The Open Championship - RAG
pub golf
There was a gap in the RAG diary
for the Tuesday of RAG week so I
have commissioned a new event
that combines two of my favourite
activities, drinking and golf. We “tee
off” at 6.30pm in the Union bar and
proceed to play the game round the
What is RAG week?
RAG stands for “Raising and Giv-
ing”. We are the charitable outlet
of Imperial College Union and our
main function is to organise the an-
nual fundraising extravaganza that
is RAG week. Some of you may
have met us during freshers’ fayre
but we hope to see a whole lot more
of you over the coming week.
RAG have been conspiring to take
over the “meeja” for some time now
so that we can encourage you all to
get involved with the fun. RAG week
is a lot of laughs for all involved and
the evenings are always a giggle.
On that note, on Thursday at the
CGCU Slave Auction (see entry
for details) you may find that Felix
have found a very imaginative task
for John Collins, Union President
to perform (and we REALLY mean
perform!). Here are some brief de-
tails of the fundraising events we
are running.
Yes, needs you!

how they intend to raise money for charity this year. And they really want you to get involved
