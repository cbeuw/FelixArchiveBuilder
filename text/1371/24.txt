going forward, their pace up front
causing problems.
For most of the first half the 4ths
played the ball around well, but
found themselves resigned to spec-
ulative efforts from over 20 yards,
and struggled to test Mustapher
Botchway in goal for the 3rds.
The 3rds went 1-0 up after 15 min-
utes when Deu knocked the ball
down to Audi just inside the 4ths’
half. Audi immediately played the
ball behind the 4th’s defence, down
the left, finding Scott Greening, pre-
viously of the 4th team, who slotted
the ball past O’Neill.
The first half continued to be
played at pace with a high degree of
skill. The 3rds created some clear-
cut chances; Deu played the ball
down the left to Greening, in a simi-
lar position to when he opened the
scoring. This time he had less luck,
forcing a good save out of O’Neill.
Just when it looked like the 4ths
might get back into it, the 3rds went
2-0 up, five minutes before half time.
The ball was played from defence to
Deu, who flicked it, with his head,
down the left flank to Greening
On Saturday 27th January, IC 3rds
faced IC 4ths in the first round of the
ULU Men’s Reserves Cup. There
was potential for an upset, with the
3rds not having played this term,
while the 4ths had played twice and
appeared to be in good form.
The match started under contro-
versial circumstances; the referee,
known as ‘Tramp’ by some, declared
he: “would not play offsides”, since
the 3rd team could not provide a
linesman. After some debate with
3rd’s captain, James Blyth, a com-
promise was met, where he: “would
play offsides in the 18 yard box”.
Early exchanges suggested the
match would be good one, played
at a fast pace. Rickards and Noone
lived up to their billing, zipping the
ball around the midfield. Mean-
while, the 3rds looked dangerous
who ran down the flank, covered by
a defender. He then cut back onto
his right foot inside the box, neatly
placing the ball just inside O’Neill’s
near post.
In the second half the game be-
came a lot more competitive; the
tackles, and the occasional late
challenge, started to fly in as the
4ths were determined to get back
into the game.
For the first part of the second
half, the 4ths were still forced into
long-range efforts. One of which
nearly got the better of Botchway,
with the keeper just managing to
claw Noone’s 30-yard effort away
from the top corner with one hand.
At the other end, Deu found himself
on the edge of the box on the right-
hand side, he cut inside, he went
down under a challenge from Scott
Mackenzie, convinced he should be
awarded a penalty. The referee said
no and play continued.
The 4ths immediately responded
by scoring; the ball was chipped
over to Viktor Jensen, a clear ben-
eficiary of the referee’s no-offside
policy, who cleverly clipped the ball
past Botchway to make the score 2-
1 with 25 minutes still to play.
The 3rds could easily have pan-
icked, allowing the 4ths back into
the match; instead, they stayed
resolute. The two Masters in mid-
field (Adam and Stewart) continued
their high work-rate, stifling the
threat of Noone and Rickards, pro-
tecting the defence.
With 15 minutes to go, Stewart
Masters won a free kick on the right
corner of the box. Greening, with
his left foot suited to the angle, de-
manded the free kick. With the wall
set covering the right side of the
goal, Greening fizzed the ball low

Snow had fallen and a chill filled the
air when St.Barts had the misfor-
tune of meeting the RSM.
RSM men are made from rock
and metal; they could only laugh
at the whimpering and shivering
syringe pushers. Our Zeus-like-
bodied team destroyed the Barts
defence, with attacking runs from
every player, including the defence.
It wasn’t long before Mikey
struck the back of the net, sending
the team’s morale flying skyward.
Barts were seen crying after Pikey
powered in a beast from a well-
played short corner and 3 commit-
ted suicide when Leon converted
the final goal; passed with precision
from a free hit just outside the D.
At half time I offered to have
my team play using only one leg
and no sticks: they accepted.
The second half was an attack-
ing nightmare due to the lack of
equipment; after 35 mins of play,
almost entirely in their half, no
one had found the net. Oh well.
Disgusted with their pitiful per-
formance they burnt the goals,
the ashes of which are now kept
in an urn as an eternal reminder
of the might that is THE RSM.
Afterwards we gave them a
proper RSM goodbye by raping
and pillaging their evil medic lair.
The RSM men took to the field with
their heads held high following ex-
cellent performances in the previ-
ous games.
by the end of the game. My diag-
nosis: we were fucking great, and
were playing against the odds with
the umpire (not Sammy the umpire
– she was good AND she was go-
ing to get cut up the next day yet
still had time for the mighty men’s
hockey team!)
The match was followed by the
Reynolds which we hit harder
than the tree. Yung, our ex-medic,
showed them what he has learnt
and where his allegiance lies. We
then performed the mandatory rap-
ing and pillaging of medics.
Man of the match went to Pike for
ace defending and twat of the match
was awarded to Rich F, ‘cause he
was so late he missed the bus by an
hour!
The esteemed RSM men’s hockey captain battles bravely with a ferocious jug of terrifying purple goo, or is that post match celebrations?
and hard towards the far bottom
corner. The ball was missed by Deu
(3rds) and Rickards (4ths) before
taking a Lampard-esque deflection
off a 4th team defender past the
helpless O’Neill. Greening claimed
his 3rd goal, although the issue will
probably have to be solved by the
dubious goals committee. At 3-1,
the 4th team were dead and buried;
the game continued with little inci-
dent until the end.
Credit for the victory must go to
the 3rds defence, who did not al-
lowed the 4ths’ skilful midfield pen-
etrate them often enough to threat-
en Botchway.

It seemed like everyone had a
great game; Pikey, Sam, Spencer
and John did an immense job of
keeping the Scum at bay in defence,
while the attack did superb plays
striking deep into the heart of the
medic defence, the midfield passed
the ball with surgical precision
around the flailing medic team.
The Medics were truly dissected
