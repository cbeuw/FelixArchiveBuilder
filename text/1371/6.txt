Bars again, by the Union President
I
accept that the President’s
view may not hold as much
authority as that of an investi-
gative journalist, but for what
it’s worth, here is my take on
events in the bars this summer. To
be fair to Andy, his page two article
in last week’s Felix raised some
serious issues that deserve discus-
sion. The second article, however,
was written by a past student living
200 miles away in Leeds and read
more like a Michael Moore conspir-
acy theory.
My side of the story
I should start by stating the obvi-
ous: I didn’t stand for President to
play politics with the bars. Events
and pressure from students have
left me and the senior management
staff no choice but to intervene.
When I sat down at my desk for
the first time last August, I was
presented with a pile of letters,
including some written by experi-
enced bar staff, which complained
about a poor culture and bad work-
ing practices on the ground floor
of Beit. There were accusations of
staff drinking on the job, poor stock
control, poor customer service and
reports of aggressive behaviour.
Some of these allegations were
supported by my own observations
and those of my colleagues. So, dur-
ing the summer and throughout
the autumn term, Senior Managers
and the Sabbs implemented two
projects that were designed to ad-
dress these concerns.
The first project was to install
the new EPoS (Electronic Point
of Sale) system, which is designed
to improve stock control, provide
trend analysis and allow us to rap-
idly react to our members. This
project was prepared well before
I became President, was enthusi-
After last week’s focus on the recent restructuring of the Union bars, the Union President, John Collins, has
asked for space in Felix to explain the changes from his point of view, and respond to Jess & Mez
astically backed by the Executive
Committee and was completed by
the start of term.
The second project was to tackle
the culture and management is-
sues described above. We wanted to
change the “Balkanised” culture of
our trading operations in Beit and
integrate them with the new EPoS
system.
We created a role for a dynamic
manager and brought the whole
Beit trading operation under one
umbrella. These changes neces-
sitated the restructuring of our
catering, entertainments and bars
divisions. This created new op-
erational, administrative and shift
leader roles but removed others.
Some staff took redundancy, some
moved jobs and since October five
new staff have joined our team. For
the record, the bar steward role
hasn’t changed significantly.
The new Trading Manager has
not been here for long but regular
customers will have noticed posi-
tive changes including chips in the
evenings, a new pool table in dB’s,
an expanded catering offer, new
pint glasses and new tables. Plans
are afoot to further improve our
catering offering and service and
within the next few weeks we also
hope to launch a new wine list and a
permanent (cheaper) real ale.
Claims and Counterclaims
It has been mentioned that our en-
tertainments cost £27,000 last year.
This is true, but our bars also made
almost £177,500 profit last year and
these days we treat entertainments
as a “loss leader”. When you add
entertainments and bars profits for
the last few years you will find that,
jointly, profit doubled last year. As
the saying goes, you have to spend
money to make money.
The successful Christmas Carni-
val also came under fire. Did you
know that in spite of reduced capac-
ity, a smoking ban and the fact that
the venue was a building site we
still took more money this Christ-
mas Carnival than we did in the
previous two combined? Clearly
we must be doing something right,
and the hard work of all our staff de-
serves praise.
The Staff Student Protocol
Even if all of this sounds sensible,
it doesn’t explain why we have kept
our student staff in the dark for the
last few months. I wish I could have
been more open, but unfortunately
my hands were tied.
I hate to sound like a school-
teacher but I must point out that the
Union is an employer and, as such,
we are forced to follow employment
law. This law forbids me from dis-
cussing restructuring exercises
in public during the “consultation
period”. If I or any of our staff had
broken this law, there is a chance
that legal action could have been
taken against the Union. The Felix
and Live! editors are sensible peo-
ple and they are fully aware of this
law. At the end of the day it is their
decision whether or not to publish
articles and Andy has explained
why he kept quiet about this matter
until the New Year, when the con-
sultation period finished.
Room for improvement?
Returning to the core issue of our
trading outlets, last week’s arti-
cles have raised some issues that I
freely admit are unsatisfactory. The
fact that the EPoS system has bugs
is not disastrous; bugs can be fixed
and some were removed this week.
I am, however, concerned about the
“I should start
by stating the
obvious: I
didn’t stand for
President to play
politics with the
bars.”
advice we received regarding the
compatibility of our system with the
College’s cashless system.
We do have some inexperienced
staff, but this is always the case at
the start of the year. I have every
confidence that they will learn
rapidly and soon provide the level
of service you all expect. I have
received comments from numer-
ous sources complementing the
friendliness of our staff, both those
who are new and those who are
experienced.
They have my unequivocal sup-
port and I would like to thank them
for their great work and commit-
ment to the Union.
On a more serious note, I want to
address accusations of threats to
those bar staff who recently left. If
this happened then I need to know.
Threats are unacceptable, but I am
not telepathic and can only take ac-
tion if I receive a complaint in writ-
ing. I can’t discipline staff on the ba-
sis of rumour or a Felix article.
Does this really matter?
At the end of the day, Jess and Mez
hit the nail on the head when they
wrotethattheseevents“wentlarge-
ly unnoticed by the student popula-
tion”. This is because our students
simply don’t care about the politics
behind the bar. They just want to
be able to buy a pint and meal for
a reasonable price without experi-
encing rude or slow service.
I know from (limited) experience
that life behind the bars is not al-
ways easy. Mopping up vomit in the
Gents’ loo isn’t the exactly best job
in the world, as I found out for my-
self recently, but the atmosphere is
still fun and friendly. I hope this will
continue and our bar team will build
a culture in our Union bars that we
can all be proud of.

Letters: where is Shama, and hawt centrefolds
Where is
Shama’s
complaint?
Sir,
It cannot help but come to my at-
tention that the last issue of Felix
did not contain a rebuttal by Shama
Rahman. Given the polarising ef-
fect that this newspaper’s coverage
of recent events has had upon the
college, and the poor image it por-
trays of the Union in general, I am
surprised at the omission of a reply
(as we were originally promised).
I believe it is a matter for concern
that the coverage in its current
state, without Ms. Rahman being
given the opportunity to publically
defend herself, gives the impres-
sion of being nothing but the result
of personal agendas within the Un-
ion, and malicious gossip.
For the sake of public faith in Fe-
lix, please do print a full rebuttal by
Ms. Rahman, or I shall be forced to
cancel my subscription.
Yours in hope,
Ajit K. Nunimush
Andy Sykes replies,
Firstly, let me say that I appreci-
ate the wonderful odour of Private
Eye letters that permeates your
missive above. Cancel your sub-
scription indeed.
As for your comment about the
lack of the letter, and the conspira-
cy implied, I’m afraid you’re sadly
mistaken. Despite a number of
conversations with Ms. Rahman,
including some rather heated ex-
changes (my fault), I have yet to re-
ceive a letter from the young lady
in question.
As I’m incapable of manufacture
in the way previous editors may or
may not have been (a polite cough
goes here), it has been impossible
for any such letter to be printed.
As for your suggestion of a ‘po-
larising’ article, that has been dis-
missed by the Union Court. ‘Nuff
said.
Centrefolds =
hot, apparently
Dear Andy,
On behalf of all the guys at office
307a (Skempton Building) I would
like to congratulate you on a first
class centrefold (Tina ‘Oh I fell’
Mulani - Fri 26th Jan) - she is too
beautiful and she has already de-
layed my report by 90 minutes just
by being in the paper. If she is ever
feeling lonely she can be assured of
a warm welcome over here.
Regards,
Shane, Niko, Owen, Bo, Mido and
Hao
Emerson Vigoureux (Felix por-
nographer-in-chief) replies,
Thanks very much, gentlemen. I go
to great length to secure only the
most beautiful models for the de-
lectation of the population of this
fine institution.
However, Ms. Mulani, as you can
imagine, is hardly lonely.
Got a problem?
Something you
want to get off
your chest? Really
can’t stand Kat
Fu’s article?
Write to Felix, and
vent your spleens.
