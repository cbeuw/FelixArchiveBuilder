Hockey). This meant a lot as it
would mean that, once distributed,
the schools could carry on with the
sport once we had left.
Not wishing to bore you all with
our exciting daily activities but
Thursday is worth a mention, for
it was our first match. Yes we were
taking on Ghana! The team we took
over really was a cross-section of
the club, except for the dispropor-
tionate number goalkeepers, with 6
in total. I don’t know how much you
know about hockey, but you do not
need 6 goalies on-pitch at once, in
fact you only need 1, leaving us with
5 players out of position, weakening
the side. Additionally, Delhi Belly
was still rife in the camp, we were
yet to adjust to the humidity and we
were playing a national U18 side. Is
that enough excuses yet? To cut a
long game short, we lost. I can’t re-
member the score but it was a good
fight and Plug (one of the goalies)
managed to score a hat trick. The
IC side showed great dedication,
but the all-male side were just too
good. As with any match we fol-
lowed with a good celebration; an
epic night in the clubs and music
venues of Accra – awesomnal!
T
oo soon it was time to
move away from Accra
and onto our base for
the following week – a
school further north in
Akosombo, via a lovely weekend of
frivolity on a tropical beach. Ako-
sombo was completely different to
our time in Accra: we were staying
in a Hotel and were being cooked
for by a wonderful teacher who wel-
comed us into her home every day.
The children and activities were
very similar, though the hockey
programme was less packed (only
5 hours a day) so we had time to
see a bit more of the country and
enjoy more of the holiday that you
may expect from a tour. This lead
us to the wonders of Dam Tuesday
when, being engineers, we were
told we should go around a huge
dam on the outskirts of the town;
and Monkey Wednesday, whch Flat
Eric was slightly too excited about,
when we ventured to a local nature
reserve for a trek to see monkeys
and baboons.
Once again the children’s sheer
enjoyment was superb and up-
lifting. Half of these children had
played before, but still we managed
to increase their enthusiasm and
give them tips for improving fur-
ther. Maria amused them with her
northern accent; it can’t be nice
being mocked by 25 children who
were supposed to being coached!
The Hoff lost his voice and broke
his stick but managed to maintain a
trail of admiring young ladies. The
Edgenator perfected his Ministry of
Silly Walks (aka dynamic stretches),
AWOL demonstrated the wonders
of his stretchy nipple, thankfully
not in front of the children. It all fin-
ished in one of the largest and most
manic Hokey-Cokeys in history.
The evenings were far quieter
than those in Accra but we still man-
aged to get out and about, sharing
in the local nightlife where there
were bars with gin and no tonic,
places with huge fridges of tonic
(and much to the annoyance of our
friendly G&T addict Dirty Money)
no gin and nothing in between.
Far too soon it was time to head
back to Accra for our final 2 match-
es, against 11 of our new friends at
the academy. The first match was
much closer; we had just about
clicked as a team and there were
far more girls in the opposing side.
Duracell was everywhere and do-
ing a great job. Captain Zizu led the
troops fantastically with the subs
carried out their water duties mag-
nificently. We played some brilliant
hockey, demonstrating all the skills
we had been coaching for the last
couple of weeks; the locals on the
sidelines were impressed. Still, we
were not quite as fit as the Ghana-
ians, nor used to the heat (and dare
I say umpires) so the game ended
in a draw. The tension was unbe-
lievable and as we knew we would
die if we had to play another 30 min-
utes, it was agreed to go straight to
P-Flicks.
We had no idea whether this
would be in our favour or not. Few
in our team had ever taken one
before and our keeper had never
saved one before. With good efforts
from everyone (and yes some flicks
saved by us) we were drawn at the
end of the first 5. Ooh, the tension.
Multiple Entry was up next, but un-
fortunately was AWOL at the side of
the pitch, suffering a bit too much
from the night before, but no-fears-
Duracell stepped up and scored. We
let the next one in – bugger. Next,
Multiple Entry made it on pitch
with the hopes of IC resting on him
– he missed, Mum didn’t save it
– match over.
On to the last night where we cel-
ebrated the last fortnight with new
friends, picked up in various bars,
and danced to the wonders of Polly
singing “do do do do do… say I love
you” (the no. 1 at the time).
With another wonderful speech
(was it the importance of hockey
and education this time?) and an-
other match we finished our trip. A
few too many fizzy pops and sheer
tiredness meant that, once again,
we could do nothing to stop a few
too many goals going in our goal
and too few in theirs.
Here we said our goodbyes as
several of us decided we wanted to
see more of the country whilst oth-
ers had the dull-i-ities of work wait-
ing for them back in the UK.
The next fortnight had many high-
lights, but since it wasn’t part of the
official tour I will be brief. Sick Note
was better and celebrated this by
sharing a bed with far too many of
the remaining group. We were am-
bushed by an over-excited Flat Eric
and Sick Note wearing not very
much in a hotel after doing a cun-
ning split and re-meet situation and
the days we had planned to be on the
beach picking up a tan were those
few days when it started to rain. We
managed to explore a larger range
of the country and spent an awful
lot of time on tours, but it was great
to see more. Being back for a while
now has given us a chance to re-
flect. We all still raise a smile about
the experience which has given us
all much more confidence in our
coaching abilities (which apply to
our own teams) whilst performing
a nice supporting role for the asso-
ciation there.
Our schools have just competed
in their first school’s hockey tourna-
ment and the work seems to be tick-
ing along nicely. Granted it might
not have been a typical hockey tour
and our skills and technical areas
may not have improved much, but
we did manage to publicise the
sport and bring it to schools that
were in need of a helping hand to
get started. We also have far more
confidence and skill in planning for
coaching within our own teams.
Thank you to everyone who came
on tour for the enthusiasm and
patience they all had. Also, thanks
to the IC Trust, Harlington Trust,
Carvers, Mercian Hockey and eve-
ryone who helped us along the way
to make the tour as successful as it
was.
