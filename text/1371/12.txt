Flashback: Keeping in its Prime
Hugh Mansfield takes a look back at Nintendo’s best-loved sci-fi adventures in the Metroid series
S
tick a gun into a game,
and the chances are the
point of it will be to blow
indiscriminate holes into
anything, or preferably
anyone, that moves. Unless it’s an
Agatha Christie-esque point-and-
click in which the gun plays some
kind of important role as evidence
or never gets fired except in a Che-
kov-inspired denouement leading
to shock, horror and one of the less
lesser alternate endings. What gen-
erally doesn’t happen is that the
gun becomes the only direct inter-
face with the environment, acting
as a puzzle-solving tool every bit as
much as it is a weapon.
The Metroid series is all-but-
unique in this regard – to all intents
and purposes they look like generic
sci-fi platformers or first person
shooters, but they have far more in
common with the likes of the Leg-
end of Zelda series (or, to put it an-
other way, with the Legend of Zelda
series). In many ways, Metroid is to
science fiction games what Zelda
is to fantasy ones – it makes more
sense to compare it with that than
with the likes of Halo, since the simi-
larities there are pretty superficial.
The most striking difference with
Zelda is that whilst both appeal to
gamers of all ages, Zelda is aimed
primarily at children. This comes
across in the more developed sto-
ryline as opposed to the vague
fragments typical of Metroid
games – the plots in
haven’t a clue what you were meant
to be doing.
While doing so, it becomes possi-
ble to find more and more powerups
to expand your health bar, your mis-
sile capacity, and suchlike, a fact
which allows for the difficulty curve
to be far steeper as you progress
further through
the game
since by
the end
you
could be due to the absence of any
releases between Super Metroid on
the SNES and Metroid Prime on
the Gamecube, during which peri-
od gaming saw an enormous boom
and game franchises became more
familiar to consumers.
Such was the gap, in fact, that
most Nintendo followers expected
the transition to 3D to fail utterly
– that Prime would turn out to be
just a run-of-the-mill FPS, rather
than being a logical continuation
of its successors so many years
beforehand. And indeed, many of
their fears were realised when it
transpired that a lot of the of the
foibles and fripperies that made the
original games so unique would be
lacking due to the impossibilities of
implementing them in 3D – these
included the high-speed running
that only proved feasible on smooth
terrain – a simple enough request in
2D, but in 3D this would have meant
making the landscapes in which it
could be utilised utterly drab; the
super jump, in which Samus would
launch herself into the air, break-
ing through any brittle landscape
in the way; the spin attack, al-
lowing almost infinite jumping
provided you face the correct
direction, and so on.
And yet, somehow they
managed to make it one of
the best 3D conversions
of a 2D series to date
– better even than the
likes of Mario and Zel-
da – certainly better
than the horrific
mutilations that
the later Sonic
games became.
It’s a subtle su-
periority, and
one that only
comes clear
through playing.
Go now, and you
won’t regret it.
are likely to have fifty times as
many missiles as at the beginning,
and twenty times as much health.
The developers have always been
sure to make the later enemies far
more likely to knock ginormous
amounts of life off the player and to
require all the resources they can
possibly spare. It also becomes im-
portant to ensure you use the cor-
rect weapon, as the idea that better
weapons should be able to destroy
everything with greater ease has
been rejected utterly by the devel-
opers – there is often a very specific
method of defeating each enemy,
neccessitating a wide range of
tactics. It keeps things inter-
esting, no matter how varied
your arsenal.
It seems strange, then,
that Metroid is far less well
known than the likes of
Mario or Zelda, from the
same stable, but much of
this
Zelda are all-im-
portant to the
gameplay,
whereas it
can hap-
pily be ig-
nored in
Metroid
in favour
of blithe-
ly blast-
ing one’s
way
through
the game.
Zelda’s
storylines
put huge em-
phasis on moral
characteristics
that the makers
feel children ought to
be taught about – moral
fortitude, courage, purity of
heart, or whatever. Of course,
there is a certain grey area sur-
rounding vandalism and theft, in
that you are positively encouraged
to – for want of a more poetic phrase
– smash the fuck out of everything
in order to nab a few rupees, but
that’s easy to ignore.
On the other hand, Metroid is pos-
itively amoral – there is no sense of
‘good’ and ‘evil’ – the protagonist,
Samus Aran, is a bounty hunter
whose targets are a crowd of space
pirates (a fact that shouldn’t be ig-
nored, since everyone loves pirates,
and everyone loves space – or at
least, everyone who loves games
does, pretty much) – the only moti-
vations of any of those involved are
aspects of self-interest; money and
survival.
Whereas most games covering
such topics do their best to ham-
mer this point home, to the extent
that they become irritating to play
thanks to an anachronistic anti-
corporate theme running
throughout, the approach here is
considerably more subtle – it’s
barely even mentioned.
There is no conception of ‘levels’
in the traditional sense – the cen-
tral conceit of the game is an ex-
ploratory one, and there
is constant back-
tracking over
old ground
once
new weap-
ons or abilities have
been gained, not only
breathing new life into areas that
would have become stale long ago
otherwise, but also cleverly stack-
ing parts of the game on top of each
other, making the most efficient use
of the space available.
Only if you forget entirely where
you were meant to be going does it
ever become even remotely boring
– and the later games even come
up with reminders about
where to go once
it becomes

Samus in her 2D prime. Dear oh dear, I’m here all year folks and I’m also available for weddings and Bar Mitzvahs
