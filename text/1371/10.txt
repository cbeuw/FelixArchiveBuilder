I, Gamer
I
t’s late, and I’m tired. And I
don’t mean, “Cripes, I could
do with a Horlicks and an
11am lie-in.” tired. I mean,
“I’m really fucking tired.”
in the kind of way that makes you
hallucinate about lolbears and
wonder how they get the surpris-
es in Kinder Surprise.
How do they do that, though?
Really. Answers on a postcard,
please.
Anyway, the reason I’m tired
isn’t because I’ve been work-
ing on Felix all weekend (As you
know, this student journalism lark
just writes itself) or, you know, do-
ing work.
Hah. It’s because I’m playing
Battlefield 2142 and have been
for... well, a while. I can’t even
remember whether I enjoy the
game any more, I’ve just slipped
into this strange, t’ai-ch’i-like cy-
cle of taking potshots and having
my arse handed to me by sugar-
rushing twelve year-olds.
Which is alright. I guess I’m
still playing after a death rate
of slightly more than one per
minute simply because I love the
game. I love the way it plays, the
way it sounds, the way it looks in
the morning when we wake up
together. I can’t really give a good
reason for it.
This issue is a bit fanboy/fan-
girlish. It’s about loving some-
thing so much it hurts a little. It’s
about the kind of geek that even
other geeks are unsure about.
We play Metroid until it stops
making sense, mourn the loss of
a war hero, and see what hap-
pens when the credits stop rolling
in Final Fantasy VII (by making it
up ourselves, with added sex).
It feels a little wrong to aspire to
a stereotype like that. But it gives
a kick, in a kind of sadomasochis-
tic way. We don’t do it because we
can’t help it. We do it because we
get something out of it. Most of
us end up at Imperial because,
once upon a time, we worked like
geeks.
As a last note, don’t forget that
the CGC are holding their next
LAN event on Saturday 3rd Feb-
ruary, with more DotA and CS 1.6
planned. It’s taking place in the
EE Building, room 509, on the
5th floor. If you can’t make it in
the building (you’ll need to swipe
in), you can call the society on the
day on 07929 022493.
Back in 2142, I question the
parentage of “noob_killa” and
enquire as to the wellbeing of his
mother. I get a torrent of abuse
and a knife to the face.
Cackle. Rinse. Repeat. I love
this game.

This week in videogaming
T
he statistic that struck
us this week wasn’t, as
the Japanese flag be-
low suggests, the gulf
between Microsoft and
the Far East. Instead, it was news
that in India, there are an estimate
1.6million XBox 360 gamers. And
despite this, console companies
and developers the world over con-
tinue to fight against the tide of the
Japanese market. This week, seven
thousand people bought 360s in
Japan. More than a hundred and
twenty thousand people bought DS
Lites.
With India and China’s continued
growth in the world, it’s likely that
the Eastern markets may become
wider, as well as Russia’s contin-
ued interest in games. The real
problem, however, remains one of
piracy. At the time of going to press,
Microsoft had recently issued finan-
cial losses of $268mn and reduced
forecasts for the coming year by 3
million units. Though the company
blames repair and warranty issues,
it’s likely that underachievement in
the East contributed to this.
Speaking about holding what
they’ve got (I’m not really sure
what I meant there), the internet
has opened its doors to the vot-
ing stage of Miss Videogame 2006.
The aim, according to the site, is
“to make the gaming industry take
women gamers seriously and treat
them with respect.”
Which is charming.
The only problem is that current-
ly, female protagonists in games
are resourceful (Beyond Good And
Evil), strong (Tomb Raider) and
generally taken quite seriously
(Metroid). By contrast, most of the
contestants at the contest seem, for
want of a better word, a bit slutty.
Alright not slutty.
But seriously, we’re unsure how
Aktrez’ incredibly smooth upper
thigh enables her to play Gears of
War any better. If you’d like to vote,
the website is taking votes until
April at www.missvideogame.com.
No more smut here though.
Highbrow news now – the Postal
movie will feature faeces and Osa-
ma Bin Laden. Possibly in the same
I think we’ve avoided it long enough. This week – women with not much clothing
Aktrez (left) and Natalie (right) striking a blow for preconceptions everywhere. God, I love the internet
scene, but there’s no confirmation
of that yet from director Uwe Boll.
In fact, it’s a triple whammy of
dull Americans this week, as Fa-
tal1ty the – ahem – best gamer in
the world, has an exciting interview
with the American media show 60
Minutes. “If he didn’t already ex-
ist, someone would have to invent
him.” explains the presenter, before
taking us to the “gaming equivalent
of Woodstock – a LAN party”.
It’s partly scary that the pinnacle
of gaming is represented by movies
about poo, female activists in bikinis
and a “modest” gamer who brands
computer parts with his own name.
If you think you could do better
to lead gaming into a brave new fu-
ture, then you might be interested
in TAPS’ forthcoming “Games Writ-
ing Workshop”, a one-day workout
for writers who want to be a part of
the Games Industry. The workshop
takes place on Wednesday 28th
February – fees, content and ap-
plication information can be found
online at www.tapsnet.org.
And we leave you with news that,
after several armed thefts of Play-
Station3s in America, a chief sus-
pect puts his defence to the FBI.
