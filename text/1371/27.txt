Few days in the history of IC have
seen testosterone, sweat and sheer
tonnage of lubricant quite on the
same order of magnitude as when
the C&G Motor Club descended
upon Streatham one fine Wednes-
day afternoon for several hours of
wheel banging around the 400m in-
door karting circuit. Bigot and Lube
Boy thoughtfully managed to book
a twelve seater minibus for over
twenty students, so the majority of
us, including the committee, had to
endure the pains of waiting for and
eventually riding a London bus.
Upon arrival we were kitted out
with suits, helmets and our very
own number plates, so that we could
identify the sod who had flipped his
kart and was burning down at turn
three. Tensions were high and it
probably didn’t help that one of the
corners was called ‘Casualty’. Each
karter was to compete in five heats,
with five karts per heat, start-
ing once from each position (1st
through 5th). Points to be awarded
at the end of each race.
Whoever had the balls to charge
from the back, by skill or by having
everyone else in front smash into
each other, would get most points.
Points are then tallied and a series
of finals take place, with the slow-
est people put in ‘Final D’. The top
three from there are then allowed
to join the end of ‘Final C’, the top
three from there going into… you
get the point? Fair enough.
Allocation of drivers for the heats
produced some interesting battles,
notably between Lube Boy and The
Green Wanker who met, fought,
crashed, and fought some more. La-
ger and Captain FatSlow had some
interesting tussles on track, most of
them involving Lager pushing from
behind (ah yeah), as Captain Fat-
Slow has the biggest arse in the mo-
tor club. FatSlow was also involved
in a heated battle with French Fry
in a separate heat which saw Fat-
Slow try to punt him off, unsuccess-
fully, to the annoyance of most of
PhDComics
the spectators.
Litres of sweat were produced
and the waiting room stank of ag-
gression as the draws for the finals
took place. After a few hilarious
starts in the lower finals, involving
several karts in a space narrower
than an amoeba’s arsehole, the
draw for the coveted ‘Final A’ was
produced. This had Green Wanker
starting from pole after relieving
himself earlier, allowing him to
weigh an impressive three stone,
closely followed by Lube Boy, Matt
2, French Fry, Lager, Captain Fat-
Slow, and Bigot – most of the usual
I’m confused, where is the car?
suspects.
The start of the race was surpris-
ingly clean, with FatSlow losing
two places as he struggled to gain
acceleration off the line and Lube
Boy managing to sneak in front of
the Green Wanker around the in-
side of the first corner. The Green
Wanker decided drastic action was
necessary to relieve Lube Boy of
his understandably slippery situa-
tion, and proceeded to smack the
shit out of him going into Casualty,
putting both karts a lap down in last
place.
Matt2 snuck into the lead fol-
lowed by French Fry and Lager,
with FatSlow and Bigot closing in
on the third-placed drunk driver.
On the second last lap as FatSlow
was going to take a stab at Lager,
Bigot decided that now was a good
time for a shunt and pushed both
karts into the barriers, continu-
ing but pulling the Captain away
from Lager, allowing both karts to
fall back into the clutches of Lube
Boy and the Green Wanker who
were plugging away to regain time.
Bigot succumbed to Lube Boy af-
ter a particularly slick overtaking
manoeuvre and was milliseconds

Motor Club have a day at the races
away from dispatching Captain
FatSlow when the flag was waved.
The first three drivers (ironically
none of the committee, all freshers)
being Matt2, French Fry and Lager
who made no mistakes. They were
awarded with Nuts, Heat, and Hello
magazines respectively as well as
four-packs of Stella, Carlsberg, and
Sainsbury’s Basics beer – Lager
wasn’t terribly impressed.
If you ever feel like joining us, the
kart garage is open on Unwin Road
in Imperial College behind the
Skempton building every Wednes-
day at 1pm.
Apparently riding around in a go kart is considered a sport these days. Whatever next – darts at the Olympics?
