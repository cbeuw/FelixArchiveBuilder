Wish on a shooting satellite
China’s January 11th test launch
which destroyed one of its old
weather satellites in polar orbit cer-
tainly raised a few eyebrows in the
international community. A medi-
um range ballistic missile was used,
splintering the defunct satellite into
a shower of space junk that threat-
ens other orbital objects nearby.
40,000 fragments to be precise, ac-
cording to David Wright of the ‘Un-
ion of Concerned Scientists’.
News of this incident, however,
only emerged on January 19th af-
ter some Pentagon officials made
a statement that they had observed
it. “Irresponsible” and ‘unaccept-
able behaviour in space” was how
the Bush administration reacted to
the test. Interestingly, the Chinese
government did not acknowledge
the event until last Tuesday.
Clearly the capability to destroy
satellites is a significant develop-
ment,technologicallyandpolitically,
with only the US and Russia having
also demonstrated such abilities.
A US Centre for Defence Informa-
tion report usefully points out that
satellites are used in “tracking the
migration of endangered sea tur-
tles”. Indeed, satellites are the eyes
and ears of any powerful military,
as well as being the tool for global
communication.
A Chinese foreign minister stat-
ed: “As the Chinese Government,
our principle stand is to promote
the peaceful use of space.
“We oppose the militarisation of
space. In the past, in the present
and in the future, we are opposed
to any arms race in space” he went
on to say, in the face of consecutive
10% increases in military spend-
ing since 1990 by the emerging
power, not including developments
programs.
Such words almost seem ironic,
but, as most analysts will happily
and speedily point out, such figures
pale in comparison to US numbers;
American Military expenditure still
manages to eclipse the rest of the
world put together. Most signifi-
cantly, it has been the Bush admin-
istration who, up until now, have
Cameron’s bringing down the cohesion barriers
This week saw the Conservative
leader David Cameron join his La-
bour counterparts in his very own
scaremongering campaign.
In a speech outlining steps to
bring down the barriers to social
cohesion he attacked the British
National Party (BNP) for preaching
“pure hate”. He continued: “And
those who seek a Shariah state, or
special treatment and a separate
law for British Muslims are, in
many ways, the mirror image of the
BNP
.”
A Shariah state in Britain! Either
Mr Cameron really believes there
is such a threat in which case I
would ask him to name one major
Muslim organisation that is calling
for this. Or he knows better and is
deliberately preying on peoples’
fears. Regardless, it seems that he
has no problem basing his political
proposals on the exaggeration of
obscure surveys.
Mr Cameron also said, “Young
white men are told: ‘The blacks are
all criminals’. Young Afro-Carib-
bean men are told: ‘The Asian shop-
keepers are ripping you off’. Young
Muslim men are told: ‘The British
want to destroy Islam’,” later add-
ing: “The best answer to ignorance
like this is a good education.”
Well, it seems a good education
hasn’t helped him in this regard.
For his very own words can easily
be paraphrased, “Young Brits are
ruled out a treaty ban on the mili-
tarisation of space; one the Rus-
sians and Chinese have been call-
ing for in fact. The US has a whole
portfolio of possible developments
including the ‘Brilliant Pebbles’
system which scatters an array of
‘intelligent’ droids in the way of a
massive ballistic missile assault,
and ‘Rods from God’, a space based
launch weapon which is quite self
explanatory.
America’s resumption of so called
‘Star Wars’ technology research in
1999 under a Clinton mired in oral
sex scandals, and the withdrawal
from the 1972 ban on anti ballistic
missile systems in 2002 under Pres-
ident Bush is quoted as the reasons
for China’s foray into such unearth-
ly weapons. Only time will tell if this
move encourages the US to agree
to not develop a new generation of
weaponry, or if it sparks the next
great arms race – to conquer the
big black void.
told: ‘The Muslims want to destroy
Britain’.” Further, he said, “They
also want to divide people into ‘us’
and ‘them’. And they too seek out
grievances to exploit.” “They” he
says. “They and we”, is that not
the same as “us and them”? Yes
Mr Cameron, an “us and them”

rhetoric does not help community
cohesion.
Lastly, the Conservative leader
also came under fire days earlier
for using the term “crusade” in
a call for the integration of Mus-
lims. He said: “Inspiring as well
as demanding loyalty from every
citizen will require a new crusade
for fairness.” The Crusades were
Christian military campaigns from
the 11th century onwards which
aimed to recapture Jerusalem and
the Holy Land from Muslim rule.
A Conservative Party spokesman
insisted that the reference had not
Adil Hussein
been intended to cause offence.
Perhaps, but it was sloppy use
of language by an election hopeful
nonetheless, particularly after US
President George W Bush caused
controversy by calling for a “cru-
sade” against terrorism following
the 9/11 attacks.
The Debate on the role of British Islam continues to spread as the Tory leader likens Muslims to the BNP because of calls for an Islamic law

ou might consider
that I have ingested a
home-made cocktail of
hippy juice or LSD, but
I assure you that I have
done no such thing.
In this terrifying world of a rising
superpower, a weary titan nation,
diminishing societal cohesion, the
cracking of postmodernism’s ideals
and my itchy spot just on that part
of the back that you can’t reach (five
years of medical education and I
still don’t know its name – Hippocra-
tes would hang his head in shame),
can’t we just all get along?
When so much in the world is
changing, it is fortunate that in
Britain we have a culture in which
we can challenge each other con-
genially, learn from the experience
and move on. Life is very short
indeed. There will always be disa-
greements between people, and
perhaps we will be able to loosely
define “British-ness”, but that will
always be subject to the objection of
others. Values are not contained by
nations, nor made correct by them.
However, whatever the vehement
differences in what we believe, for
the most part let us breath a sigh of
relief. We are able to get along with
our studies, work and ultimately
our lives with the most minimal of
hassle. Isn’t a society where we all
agree to get along pretty well off?
