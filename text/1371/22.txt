Saturday the 20th dawned earlier
for some as eight Imperial debaters
made their way to UCL for 9am for
the UCL IV 2007, a debating com-
petition featuring 34 teams from
around London and beyond. For
several of the debaters (including
me) this was to be their first com-
petition and as the hundreds of
people filed into one of the lecture
theatres in UCL
’s medical depart-
ment, the cruciform building, they
knew little or nothing about what
would happen.
It soon emerged that each team
would debate four times before the
final, for which the best four teams
would be selected. Slowly the first
motion to be debated appeared on
the projector and we would be de-
bating whether teachers should be
given a statutory stop and search
power on school grounds. It was
then it all started to go horribly
wrong as we discovered that 80%
of the debaters there were law stu-
dents or trainee barristers.
Nevertheless, the four Imperial
teams held their own throughout
the first round even though the law-
yers brought up the human rights
act every few minutes as though
they had written the damn thing.
The second round came upon us
like a lion upon a small wounded
deer; we debated whether the par-
ents / guardians / those with right
of attourney should be able to cast a
proxy vote on the behalf of the men-
tally ill. It was an interesting round
although it didn’t take us long to
find the general theme that had
been snuck into the competition
– the law. Gone were our hopes of
a debate on stem cells, the speed of
light, genetic engineering or even
Pro Evolution Soccer 7.
Lunch was a welcome break and
so off we went to McDonalds to
get some quality food to refuel our
minds for the second half of the day.
Our fears were confirmed as the
third round was announced, and we
spoke about whether defendants
should have the right to elect trial
by judge alone without a jury.
This is something that I’m sure
we knew little or nothing about com-
pared to a lawyer but we cleverly in-
vented utter bollocks to fill the time
during our speeches, which at the
time made sense, but then again
most of the judges were lawyers too.
No escape. The final round dawned
and up came the motion, which
struck like the Leviathan upon the
sinking ship of whatever hope we
had left. Yes believe it or not we had
to develop convincing arguments
about whether MI6 should have its
remit widened to encompass retali-
atory corporate espionage. The mo-
tion was no doubt interesting… I’ll
just leave it at that.
UCL were kind enough to put on
a massive feast for the debaters af-
terwards and it was all well worth
the £10 we each put forward for
the competition. We even stayed to
watch the final to see some spec-
tacular debaters at work, it felt
better to see them in the final and
know that we had faced them only
hours before. It is this kind of com-
petition, where debaters from all
over the country get to debate with
each other regardless of ability that
makes it more exciting.
It is certainly true that we learnt
a lot from our day at UCL and if we
thought some of the motions were
a bit weird, well I guess we learnt
more from speaking about them.
Thanks must go to the debaters
who made the epic journey, Shilpa
Kodati, Simon Lumley, Yazan
Billeh, Anthony Maina, Jamillah
David, Kewen Chen, Aneurin Young
and Alex Kendall. Thanks also Ed
for organising our entry into the
competition.
Debate society meets every
Wednesday at 6pm in SAF near
room 120. People are welcome to
join up! Competitions are always
great fun and really improve speak-
ing skills.
Novice debaters enjoying the competition and the food, yes, I’m looking at you on the right, at UCL
