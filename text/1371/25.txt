T
he summer may now
seem like a distant
memory but back when
the sun shone, course-
work deadlines were
non-existent and when we could sip
Pimms in the park, without a care
in the world, the Imperial College
Hockey Club were about to embark
on their summer tour of Ghana.
A random invitation resulted in
a tour that would be like no other;
“Would we like to go to Ghana, and
play/coach some hockey?”
Before we realised what was hap-
pening, term had ended, nurses had
injected us against most known dis-
eases of the southern hemisphere
and we were on the plane to Africa
wondering:
What on earth were we going to
do?
Why had we trusted Mum with
the organisation; she couldn’t even
make it off the plane at Amsterdam
with her passport?
Why, exactly, had we been invited
to the wedding of a village chief the
following day?
The first couple of days went by
in a blur, leaving us barely enough
time to gain our bearings; a royal
appointment in a small village in
the Volta region (a days travel away
from the airport) and Chief Togbe
Mottey III’s wedding taking up
most of those two days. The week-
end was a whirl of random road
trips, celebrations, dancing and an
eventful midnight trek to Togo (and,
of course, a fair amount of beer and
cards), before heading to Accra for
our first coaching session.
We were working closely with the
National Hockey Association and
some local schools to aid the de-
velopment and profile of the sport
in Ghana. Before we left several
people had trained as coaches; be-
tween us, we planned what we
hoped to be a useful and fun pro-
gramme, though this did nothing
to suppress nerves before the first
session. Everyone did an awesome
job, proving the nerves were not re-
quired, despite the numbers being
far higher than we had anticipated.
The children’s enthusiasm was so
great that the three hour session
flew by in drills, frisbee games and
mini-matches.
I’m not sure we saw much im-
provement in the children in the
first session, we hadn’t really
planned for them to, but their en-
joyment of the sport and willing-
ness to play was encouraging; we
had a starting point and could plan
to move forward. That evening was
the World Cup final (yes, I told you
it was a long time ago!) so we found
a random sports bar with a TV and
spent the evening explaining to the
locals we weren’t French or Italian
even though we were all wearing
blue.
5.30am came all too early the next
morning (and every morning that
week). It was time for us to ven-
ture into the schools and begin the
real grass-roots coaching we were
looking forward to. We worked in
5 schools dotted around the Accra
area; the facilities were varied, with
many of the schools never having
played before. What was the best
thing to do? Give everyone a stick
and see what happens! It could
have been carnage, but with a few
useful coaching points passes were
vaguely in the right direction and,
by the end of the session, the chil-
dren were dribbling balls. We were
keen to progress the next day, de-
spite some rather school-day-like
summons to the headmistresses’
offices to discuss how the project
would be sustained and the future
of hockey at the various schools.
That done, it was time to try and
not get lost on the public transport
system and get back to our lodgings
for some food and further doses of
sun-tan cream.
The afternoon session was much
like the day before, over 100 keen,
hockey-stick wielding youngsters
on one pitch. They were obviously
enjoying themselves and we were
encouraged to see several people
who had been part of the school
sessions earlier that day. The drill
sergeant, Maria, had them running
everywhere, while the Hoff was just
a tad too enthusiastic; rumours
have it someone chased a poor tim-
id goalkeeper through the market!
We followed with a rest and re-
cuperation evening (with a swift
fine circle) as we enjoyed being in
the same place for 2 nights, which
hadn’t happened in the 5 days we
had been in Ghana.
The rest of the week followed in a
similar fashion; visiting the vibrant
and bustling markets, intriguing
corners of the city and the odd
bar (or two). The improvement in
standard of play (and our coaching)
was immense. Granted we had peo-
ple falling ill but everyone coped
and the pitches (or random patch-
es of mud) were filled with cham-
pagne hockey skills that would be
a welcome part of our teams here
in London. After 3 long afternoons
of negotiations, Mum managed
to get our kit released from cus-
toms; so we were able to present
the National Association with 250
hockey sticks, a goalie kit and 100
balls (kindly donated by Mercian
