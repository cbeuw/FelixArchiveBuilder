Shaw gives a
lesson in small talk
Fiona Shaw as Winnie in Happy Days now showing at the National Theatre
This much-delayed exhibition of the
development of portraiture in the
late 18th and early 19th centuries,
seems, on the surface, more like
the pages of a history book than an
important art exhibition.
On entering you are faced with the
imposing figure of Napoleon on his
Imperial throne, flanked by Louis
XVI and Marie Antoinette. Moving
through the whos-who list of por-
traits is ever more impressive, with
kings, philosophers and politicians
lining the walls of the gallery. Not
to say that seeing the faces of the
people who shaped our society to
such an extent isn’t interesting, but
these portraits are so much more
than records of their existence.
Take the portraits of Napoleon
(Ingres, 1906) and Louis XVI (Cal-
let, 1789), for example. They sit next
to each other in the first room and
were painted less than 20 years
apart, yet the style and impression
of the portraits are very different.
The portrait of the doomed king is
almost pastel in its shades, and ex-
poses a man of wealth and luxury.
Napoleon, on the other hand, is
an imposing portrait full of symbols
of power like the eagle and laurel
wreath of Imperial Rome. The back-
ground is dark and the figure rides
Happy Days
by Samuel Beckett
National Theatre
Until March 1st
Her situation is a kind of hell, a life
controlled by a bell for waking and a
bell for sleep, though she refuses to
see it as that.
Beckett’s plays famously contain
particularly meticulous stage di-
rections, and as such could lead a
lesser actor to become complacent
in their role.
Shaw, however, takes over the
character so much that by the end
her acceptance of being immobile
in a pile of dirt seems completely
natural.
When, in the second half, her head
is all that protrudes, from the rubble
I was desperate for someone to put
her out of her misery with the ever-
so-tempting revolver lying nearby,
but she is as resolute as ever. Her
optimism seems to hold her up, and
her speech is like the gasps of air of
someone drowning.
A particularly hypnotic piece, this
is a good introduction to Beckett.

Having never seen Fiona Shaw on
stage before, I was sceptical about
this, the NT’s new production of
Samuel Beckett’s Happy Days.
Genuinely talented actors are
passed up for roles far too often in
Theatreland in favour of big screen
names, often, in my opinion, to the
detriment of the production.
However, having seen her sit
half-encased in a mound of post-
apocalyptic rubble and make Beck-
ett’s endless stream of monoto-
nous dialogue come alive I am all
admiration.
With little more than a couple of
props and her own gestures, the
protagonist Winnie (Shaw) sur-
veys her life and pushes herself
through her day, seeing the best in
everything.
Indeed, despite its setting, the
play is very easy to relate to. Eve-
ryone knows a couple like this, the
wife endlessly chattering whilst the
husband completely ignoring her.
But that’s not to say that this is an
uplifting play to watch. Very funny
in places, it paints a terrifying pic-
ture of the pointlessness of life,
complete with a silent (and possibly
masturbating) husband, and the lit-
tle rituals that get us through the
day.
out of the painting like the bow of
a ship emerging from the dark,
his robes flowing like the waves on
the ocean. Painted just a couple of
years after he became Emperor
of France, the portrait would have
been used to cement his political
position.
A later portrait of Napoleon by
David (himself a prominent French
revolutionary) shows a more re-
alistic portrayal, as he stands by
his desk after apparently working
through the night. The steady ex-
pression on the emperor’s face,
though more human, is nonethe-
less challenging, and in some ways
his power as a man seems greater
for being exposed yet authoritative.
Movingthroughtheexhibition,the
emphasis shifts from monarchs to
philosophers and scientists. These
images, of Goethe, Hume, Hutton,
Rousseau and Voltaire, amongst
others, shows the shift of society to-
wards the Age of Enlightenment, a
period of scientific and philosophic
innovation.
Rauch’s sculptures of Goethe are
a fine example of this shift. Dressed
as a Roman senator, and posed
deep in thought, he has all the
presence of a great figure, but with
much more realism, expressing the
rationality of thinking of the time.
Pigalle’s Voltaire Nude is, at first
glance, a classical statue, but on
closer inspection you see the sags,
wrinkles and veins of his aged body,
a style which is not particularly
easy to view.
For me, the most interesting
room in the exhibition was the one
dedicated to images of the artists
themselves, both painted by con-
temporaries and by themselves.
Not suffering from the egos and
commercialism of commissioned
pieces, these paintings show a de-
velopment of the intimacy of por-
traiture. Several, most noticeably
Køble’s self-portrait, are surpris-
ingly modern in their textured, and
reminded me of Lucian Freud.
The exhibition also has some hu-
morous moments. In the section on
Allegorical Portraiture you can see
the ordinary bulbous English faces
of the new upwardly mobile classes
of the late 18th century painted as
Greek gods or figures from mythol-
ogy. Commissioned to show their
elevated rank, the portraits are
mostly laughable, a notable excep-
tion being Reynold’s gothic Mrs.
Siddons as the Tragic Muse.
The final room of the exhibition
is dedicated portraiture after the
defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo.
Despite the efforts of royalists to
restore the dynasties of old Europe,
the middle-classes had risen and
republican spirit continued. This is
shown in Ingres’ Monsieur Bertin,
where the gruff and powerful editor
of the liberal ‘Journal des débats’,
a portrait where the intellect and
conviction of the sitter supplants
his social standing.
