As you may have noticed, I’ve not
been sighted in these parts before
but having got lost in the wilds of
Beit Quad I found my way to the Fe-
lix office and was threatened with
death unless I wrote a good cross-
word for this week’s paper.
I’m not entire sure if I’ve suc-
ceeded yet, so try it out and judge
for yourself. You might like to know
that as I wrote I became increas-
ingly desperate to get out and get a
drink, which almost led to an alco-
holic theme among some of the an-
swers. Although whether that will
help you is debatable.
Anyway, I need to go for a drink.
Enjoy!

random entry to win £10 based on criteria based mostly on the mood
we’re in. Last week’s winner was Emily Lines, who happened to be in the
office at the time. Maybe if people actually sent in non-wrong answers...

Aquarius (20 Jan – 18 Feb)
“Why don’t you love
me?” “You follow me.
The claustrophobia
brings me to the
brink...” “The brink of
what?” “To the edge
of the water. Sometimes I wake up
on the shore with my feet covered
in sand” “But we live in Siberia and
there isn’t any shore.”
Capricorn (22 Dec – 19 Jan)
This week I had a dis-
turbing dream about
incest. There was
much shame involved,
as well as some
webbed fingers. I can
only assume that my subconscious
hates. When I woke up, I was ut-
terly convinced that I had had sex
with my mother.
Sagittarius (22 Nov – 21 Dec)
According to a young
lady I met on the inter-
nets, you (the female
part of the reader-
ship) can touch your
ovaries. Apparently
this is, and I quote, “really wicked”.
This thought disgusts me, and I
had to go masturbate over a pic-
ture of Sally Gunnell to feel better.
Scorpio (23 Oct – 21 Nov)
2 x Coke 1.5 litre, 2
x garlic bread with
cheese, 1 x “Vegetar-
ian Volcano” pizza,
1 x “Meat Feast”
deep pan pizza, 1 x
“Chicken Barbeque Sizzler” pizza
= one happy Felix office. Wednes-
day is pizza day, and man can we
eat pizza.
This Week’s Whore of Babylon
Gemini (22 May – 21 Jun)
Once upon a time
there was a small
boy named George.
George used to hide
by woodland paths
and leap out at pas-
sers-by, making them jump with
fright. ‘Til one day, an old lady had
a heart attack. Terrified, he ran
away. She died and cat starved.
Taurus (21 Apr – 21 May)
Last week’s horo-
scope was marred
by certain libellous
claims regarding baby
rape and convoluted
sentences. No beare-
ded intruders imployed by this
paper have ever convoluted a sen-
tence in their life. Everything else
is both true and very fun indeed.
Aries (21 Mar – 20 Apr)
Caution is your watch-
word. You have killed
and kill again you
must, but care must
be taken. Your lucky
number is 2 and your
lucky chemical is Quicklime. Play
your cards right and that tenacious
forensic investigator on your tail
will be naught but a sticky memory.
Pisces (19 Feb – 20 Mar)
I have of late, but
wherefore I know
not, lost all my mirth,
forgone all custom of
exercises. And indeed,
it goes so heavily with
my disposition that this goodly
frame, the earth, seems to me a
sterile promontory.
Then everybody dies.
Libra (23 Sept – Oct 22)
This week, your flirta-
tious nature lands you
in trouble. His missus
chases you through
Beit armed with a pro-
pelling pencil and a
broken bottle. Luckily, the situation
resolves itself when an Original
Tour bus ploughs into her and
splashes her bile over the road.
Virgo (23 Aug – 22 Sept)
I found some semen
on my coat today. It
wasn’t mine.
How it got there, I will
never now. Even the
best case scenario is
that I sat on an object covered in
tadpole rivulets. The image in my
head that I can’t shake is of a man
masturbating behind me on a bus.
Leo (23 Jul – 22 Aug)
A priest walking along
the cliffs comes across
a crying young girl.
He asks her why she’s
crying. “My mummy
and my daddy just fell
down there,” pointing at the red-
smeared rocks. The priest looks
around, and says: “It’s not your
day, is it dear?” as he unzips his fly.
Cancer (22 Jun – 22 Jul)
Zombies.
Zooooombies.
Zooooommmmmbies.
When I grow up, I
want to be a zombie.
I’ll scream for brayns,
and wander through the streets,
and eat my family. I wonder what
my friends taste like all the time.
Probably chicken.
