Dreaming of Oscar success
With 8 nominations, Hollywood seems to like Dreamgirls, but is it up to the hype?
Despite generally having an open
mind, when the title of this film
first reached my ears a couple of
months back, my heart sank. It con-
jures up two very different images
of either kids’ TV or a late-night
show for which you need the Sky
PIN. It didn’t help to hear that Be-
yonce would be the lead, and some
American Idol act would make up
the support; especially when it
turned out they’d be playing,
shock, singers. But don’t let
it be said that Dreamgirls
has no surprises up its
sleeve.
The story of a three-
piece girl group trying to make
it big as Motown explodes out of
Detroit seems fun enough, and
while this is the quest you’ll see for
the whole film, something strange
happens about halfway through.
At this point it seems as though
the producers just threw the plans
up in the air when someone whis-
pered “Oscars” and the whole thing
changes direction. The distribution
company launched a massive Oscar
campaign so, given its recent snub
in the Best Picture category, is
there something letting Dream-
girls down?
If you like musicals, this
could be the film of the year
for you. Without more than
one minute between num-
bers much of the time,
this show has so
many songs packed
into its lengthy
running time that
you come out feel-
ing exhausted by
the pace. The dec-
Happyness, Happyness, the greatest gift that I possess
Chris Gardner (Will Smith) is on the
verge of hitting rock-bottom; he’s
overdue on taxes, he’s late on rent,
his wife (Thandie Newton) seems
pretty nasty, and his son (Jaden
Smith) attends a day care in China-
town that spells happiness with a y.
His only way out is the slim chance
of a job after an unpaid competitive
internship at a prestigious firm of
stockbrokers. When his wife leaves
and he’s left without a home, Gard-
ner must face homeless shelters,
public bathrooms and an unhappy 5
year-old son whilst desperately try-
ing to excel in the office.
On the surface, the movie is a
classic ‘rags to riches’ heart-warm-
ing tale of human willpower and
strength. Underneath, it is Holly-
wood’s ‘Pursuit of an Oscar’. While
based on a true story, a certain
amount of guilt comes with mock-
ing its sympathy-seeking portrayal;
now a successful stockbroker with
best selling novel, Gardner and his
son really did spend the night in a
subway toilet and he did queue for
hours to get a bed in a homeless
shelter all the while working on the
off-chance he might get a better job.
A sucker for tear-jerkers like me
can ignore the obvious milking of a
true inspirational story – I was root-
ing for him the entire time. Others
might roll their eyes when Gardn-
er’s only source of light to work by
flickers out after just sitting down
under it. It’s a shame. The truth be-
hind it all is the recipe for a classi-
cally moving and successful movie.
Instead we get a great storyline
with excessively ‘Hollywoodized’
scenes, mediocre dialogue and
completely unnecessary voiceover.
It irritated me; the attempts at pro-
found statements were pointless
when the content speaks for itself.
A saving grace, however, is Will
Smith. After his latest few movies,
which required very little acting tal-
ent, we are reminded of his Ali days.
All is forgiven when watching his
incredibly impressive ability to ex-
press the strongest emotions with
very little effort. Where many actors
would throw their arms around and
FLAM
In the inevitable film-release lull
that occurs in the post-nomina-
tion, pre-Oscar period, we are
fortunate this year to have sever-
al films around to keep us going
through the lean times. Look out
for Notes on a Scandal, an im-
pressive-looking drama starring
Dame Judy and Cate Blanchett,
as well as Dreamgirls (reviewed
this week).
Next week we will have a com-
petition to win a Valentine’s
(retch) weekend away with sec-
ondary prizes of DVDs such as
Anchorman, Old School, and Na-
poleon Dynamite.
Also, congratulations to Jon
Matthews and Druv Nagpal, the
winners of our Breaking & En-
tering competition a few weeks
ago.
Sadly, so far no-one has taken
up my generous offer to publish
reviews of older films or passion
pieces on actors/directors. I can
only assume that this lack of re-
sponse is because you people
suck. Prove me wrong, people.
I’m sure you all have favourite
films, or films that everyone else
loves but you hate and wish to see
nailed to the tree of shame and
publically urinated upon. As al-
ways, feel free to tell me the above
actor/character combination, and
in which film he appears. film.fe-

I can see right up your nose
shout, somewhat surprisingly Will
Smith can create the same effect
with one single tear. Regardless of
the fact that he’s obviously begging
for a Golden Statue, he deserves it
– let’s hope the Academy agrees.
On the other hand, a major disap-
pointment was the first appearance
ade it covers sees Motown arrive,
R‘n’B take off, and the new sound
of the disco explosion herald the
beginning of the 70s. However, with
such tight packaging, each song
blends into the others and it’s hard
to remember many that stand out.
To make it more confusing, the dia-
logue is sung in lots of places, total-
ly unnecessarily. It has three Oscar
nominations
for
Best Original Song: Even the Acad-
emy couldn’t remember which was
which obviously.
What has drawn attention to the
film, however, is the acting it show-
cases. With so many songs it’s hard
to judge the cast as actors rather
than performers a lot of the time,
but each shows talent on both sides.
Is Beyonce any good then? A Gold-
en Globe nomination says yes,
but she doesn’t
really do
much for the first half, and you’re
always aware you are watching
Beyonce and not Deena Jones.
How about Eddie Murphy? Contro-
versially, I’m going to say nothing
surprising came here and his was
not the performance I’ll remember.
He is good, oh yes, but there is one
woman who will bring the house
down for every performance…
Jennifer Hudson shows that the
best UK reality TV show hope, Le-
ona Lewis, has a long way to go to
match the American contingent. A
runner-up on American Idol, this
woman steals the film from under
Beyonce’s nose (and rumour has
it y’all ain’t happy ‘bout it) with a
performance that channels “all
the greats, Aretha, Whitney, Billie
Holiday” as Hudson claims her in-
spirations. The powerhouse “And I
Am Telling You I’m Not Going” is
the one stand-out number because
of her delivery, and it rescues the
film from a horrible moment of
cheese immediately preceding
it. This is Hudson’s film and
she ‘supports’ no-one, despite
her strong standings in the
awards season.
Dreamgirls is a fun journey
(for the most part) but by no means
a stunning critique on celebrity.
Fun is what the audience will look
for here, and for the most part it will
deliver along with the melodrama
that envelopes the second half. Bill
Condon, the director, says that in
bringing this Broadway musical to
the big screen he was able to con-
vey the social problems in the US
at the time, whether racism or
civil unrest in Detroit. However,
this is not what the songs are
about. Music is the foundation
on which Dreamgirls is based,
and for those who enjoy
musicals, this won’t leave
you disappointed. Just
exhausted.

of Will Smith’s son – Jaden Smith. I
was excited to see their on-screen
chemistry and the reason behind
the choice to put this kid in there.
I’m still waiting. It may have been
the dialogue, but I saw very little
from him. I was expecting a truly
moving performance, some real
father-son emotion, or at least
something cute. There is poten-
tial though; the one scene where
he throws a bit of a tantrum when
he realises he and his father have
been locked out of their motel room
– I was convinced.
In the end, the movie was enter-
taining. If you avoid over-analysing
the way in which it’s made, you can
look past the irritating voice-over,
and feel warm and fuzzy as the
movie does what it sets out to do. It
entertains you, it makes you laugh
and cry, it does have a great sto-
ryline, and it gives you the classic
‘rags to riches’ feeling. It might just
be me (a sucker for all things emo-
tional) but I certainly didn’t hate it.
