This Tuesday saw the official launch
of the College’s Centenary celebra-
tions, commemorating a hundred
years since the founding of Impe-
rial College in 1907.
The event was marked with of-
ficial cake-cutting ceremonies
(complete with plenty of free cake
for bystanders) at both the College
and the Union. The Rector cut a
cake in the Tanaka entrance, and
introduced the student who will
be running in the London Mara-
thon for the Centenary Campaign.
The Deputy Rector, Professor Sir
Leszek Borysiewicz, gave a brief
speech to students gathered in Beit
Quad before the centenary balloon
race. Hundreds of blue balloons
were launched out of the Quad, in-
cluding one which managed to get
jammed in the scaffolding on the
Union building.
The money raised during the Cen-
tenary period will be used to fund a
number of projects. Chief among
these are the Beit Redevelopment,
and the Student Hardship Fund.
Student events were also to be
found on campus; the Artsfest
squad were out in force to advertise
their upcoming events, ICU’s Big
Band provided some rather pleas-
ant music in the Quad, while ICRa-
dio deafened those waiting in line

“Any excuse for an alliterative headline,” says Felix
to take tours of the Queen’s Tower,
which was open for the day.
In the evening, the Rector gave
his Centenary Lecture in the Great
Hall, which filled the room to capac-
ity. He spoke warmly about the Col-
lege’s history, and outlined the Col-
lege’s vision for the future in form
of the College Fund, a large store of
money which will be used for facility
improvements, including hall rede-
velopments. He disappointed those
present who were hoping for an an-
noucement on Imperial’s recent bid
for BP’s £500m Biofuels Institure to
come to the campus, skirting the
topic entirely; when approached by
Felix, he said: “I don’t know, no-one
knows. It could be tomorrow.”
Rector’s lecture
The Rector, Sir Richard Sykes, delivering his well-received Cente-
nary lecture to the great and good of the College. He discussed the
history of the South Kensington campus, including the revelation
that one of the original foundation stones of the original College
laid by Edward VII was lost or destroyed during the construction
of the Tanaka Business School. He also managed a quick jocular
reference to Felix, showing a cover of an issue from 1957 and com-
menting: “This was back when Felix was a good newspaper.”
