Union secures pay
rise for PhD students
The Union has secured an agree-
ment that the College will pay
London students their full London
weighting, amounting to an annual
increase of around £2000 in some
departments. The agreement is a
culmination of efforts by volunteer
research representatives and the
sabbs.
The short-changing was brought
to the attention of postgraduate
representatives in the Mathemat-
ics Department. The department
has being paying their students
£12,300 per annum, compared to
the £14,300 recommended by the
ESPRC, leaving maths PhDs £2000
out of pocket.
The short-changing is not con-
fined solely to the Maths Depart-
ment, as a dossier prepared by
research representatives Daniel
Sauder (RCSU) and Eirini Spentza
(CGCU) shows.
It reveals that almost all depart-
ments have been short-changing
their PhD students, though not all
to the same extent as the Maths
Department. Computing, for exam-
ple, pays an amount between the
ESPRC amount and the Maths De-
partment amount.
The dossier was presented to the
Strategic Education Committee,
a College meeting that students
are not normally invited to attend,
by Ben Harris (Deputy President,
Education & Welfare). The pres-
entation was initially to be given
by Shama Rahman (Deputy Presi-
dent, Graduate Students), but snow
had delayed her tube journey and
she arrived around 20 minutes late
for the meeting.
The SEC sets high-level College
policy on educational matters, and
initial talks between Deputy Rec-
tor Professor Sir Leszek Borysie-
wicz indicated that the Committee
were in favour of awarding the full
amount.
The Committee approved the
recommendation, and the College
Management Body approved the
measure last Friday. This means
that departments will now be forced
to pay the full amount, regardless of
the funding source of the PhD stu-
dent. This will apply to both new
and current students, but unfortu-
nately will not be backdated.

Volunteer postgrad reps’ dossier convinces the College to pay
PhD students in all departments their London weighting
The Union has issued a somewhat
triumphant press release on the
Union website (www.imperialcol-
legeunion.org) that emphasises the
role of the sabbatical officers in this
achievement; however, credit must
also be given to the two volunteer
representatives that gave up their
time to produce the dossier.
This is a rare clear victory for
the Union in its dealings with the
College, with the combination of
student reps and sabbs working to-
gether to produce a quick and com-
prehensive solution.
No confidence in
sabb to go ahead
Andy Sykes
Editor-in-chief
The Union Court has issued its ‘de-
termination’ on the no confidence
motion submitted against Shama
Rahman, Deputy President (Grad-
uate Students). The motion has
been deemed to be constitutional,
and is to be voted on at an emer-
gency session of Council this com-
ing Monday.
The Court, famous already for its
lengthy meetings, took four hours
to debate the motion. A number of
points were discussed, from the
legality of some of the evidence to
complaints about prejudicial re-
porting by Live! and Felix. Both
publications escaped any censor-
ship, and their respective editors
“had so far acted responsibly” in
the eyes of the Court.
The vast majority of the twelve-
page determination considers the
status of Ms Rahman (once again
referredto,amusingly,as“SabbD”).
She, like the other sabbs, signed a
employment contract at the start
of her term of office, and the Court
has decided that this makes her an
employee of the Union.
This raised questions as to wheth-
er Ms Rahman could make a case
for constructive or unfair dismissal,
should she be no confidenced by
Council. Under the Employment
Rights Act 1996, she does not have
the right to sue for unfair dismissal,
as this right applies only to people
who have been employed for more
than a year.
The Court had also discussed
‘guidelines’ for the media at a pre-
vious meeting, which John Collins
(Union President) said would allow
him to “censor” reporting by Live!
and Felix on the no confidence
motion.
The Live! editor, Ashley Brown,
accepted that it may be necessary
to have guidelines for the press,
but that they should only be guide-
lines and therefore not actively
enforced.
These would then only be con-
sidered in the light of a complaint,
rather than immediately censoring
the publication in question. The Fe-
lix Editor, Andy Sykes, was strongly
opposed to any such guidelines, ar-
guing that as the Court had found
the editors to be acting in good faith
so far, and that they should be trust-
ed to do their jobs properly.
John Collins defended the need
for guidelines, saying that as a trus-
tee of the Union he could be person-
ally liable for anything Felix or Live!
published that could be considered
defamatory.
He also stated that he had no
problem with the Felix Editor being
sued for anything Felix printed, but
that he would not be willing to de-
fend Felix or its editor in court, if it
came to that.
After a somewhat protracted and
circular discussion, the Court even-
tually decided that no guidelines
were necessary, and that the print-
ing of anything which may carry
legal implications is left up to the
judgement of the editors.
The Court also discussed the
front page of Felix, in which alle-
gations from a leaked draft copy of
the no confidence motion were re-
ported, in terms of whether it would
prejudice the eventual decision of
Council. The Court decided that no
remark made in the article would
so prejudice a Council member that
they would not be able to put it out
of mind during the hearing of the
motion.
A number of procedural meas-
ures were discussed; neither Jon
Matthews (the proposer) or Ms
Rahman will be able to vote, proxy
votes will be disallowed (as this
means the donator of the vote will
not give a fair hearing), and the
somewhat controversial email evi-
dence retrieved by Mr Matthews
from Ms Rahman’s email account
will be admissable. Seconders of
the motion will be allowed to vote,
as it was felt that removing one-fifth
of Council would make the hearing
undemocratic.
