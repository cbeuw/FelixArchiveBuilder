Rambo: Beyond First Blood
So heroes never die, do they? Well, I
suppose this bombastic statement re-
fers to more than actual beating heart
and pulse, but whatever might be said
about other heroes, death seems to
stay away from Rambo – in a manner
of speaking.
You may have heard of him before,
when he turned a whole town upside
down after being spitefully arrested;
or when he went back into Vietnam to
save some POWs and ended up slaugh-
tering a lot of despicable Vietnamese
soldiers; or when he travelled to Af-
ghanistan to save the life of his friend
and mentor. But seeing Sylvester Stal-
lone have his way with the Burmese
army, twenty plus years since his first
venture into the pure evil of this world,
is a view to be relished by any action-
fan, as it sets new standards in both
despicable villainy and righteous retri-
bution of pain and suffering.
In the beginning of this very slick
looking jungle film, John Rambo seems
to have contented himself with the
serene life of a snake
catcher somewhere
near the border of
Burma, where – we
are told – a most
terrible genocide is
taking place. Hav-
ing been bluntly
informed of the
purposeofthisfilm
in the first minute,
we move on to its
scope when a cou-
ple of army-sadists
play the Burmese
version of the
hundred metres
sprint, sending the
unfortunate locals
running through
crop fields ridden
with mines and the
bets are on for who
blows up first. Fast
forward to good old
Rambo, who resides
in a small camp where
entertainment consists
of a young lad doing a
one-on-one with a cobra.
To break the monotony of
the day, a couple of naïve
Americans rock up need-
ing Rambo to take them by
boat into Burma, where they
want to help the locals. With
John’s sense of justice still dor-
mant at this point of the film, he
initially refuses to help them, but
is eventually persuaded by the sole
woman of the group, whose eloquent
speech about time and being seems to
hit a chord with him. An exciting boat
ride later (during which we are offered
a glimpse of what is to come), the aid
workers barely get to “make a differ-
ence” before the Burmese army storms
With Rocky having thrown his final punch, Sylvester Stallone jumps back into the
shoes of bloodthirsty Rambo. For cynics and superfans alike, Felix goes in for the kill

iven the pretty lacklustre
turn out at the BAFTAs
the other week, I found
myselfthinkingthisweek
about the one thing that
won’t be coming out this awards sea-
son; stars.
Now, don’t get me wrong - this isn’t
necessarily a bad thing. Despite a fas-
cinated interest in them - akin to what
some depressingly morbid people refer
to as car crash interest - I do find the
Oscars a horribly anachronistic and
awkward sight to behold. There would
be a certain amount of disappointment
if they fully welcomed in foreign film-
makers as then there would be nothing
to complain about. The whole point
of awards when the winners are taken
care of is the pleasure of debate that
they evoke from people.
However, it hasn’t always been so.
Between the birth of the Oscars (1928)
and the 1960s, as narrative cinema
ousted documentary and avant-garde
cinema from the mainstream, Hol-
lywood was born and the machine
creaked into operation. Not content
with providing monopoly filmmaking
in the US, the machine sucked in Eu-
ropean and British cinema as well to
create the standard model almost as
scientific as the quantum theory that
was being developed at similar times.
This was how stars were formed.
Under long (perhaps up to 7 years)
contracts, they moulded people who
would become household names - Gre-
ta Garbo, Bette Davis, Cary Grant, etc.
This wasn’t a system for whiners: your
studio told you what to wear, when to
go to bed and who you could marry.
Human rights violation? Well, most of
them did alright out of it.
These names made the Oscars. In a
day when you know everything about a
‘star’ and think their best performance
in the last year was in an Armani ad,
the image rusts. Even the odd one who
could lay claim to any sense of mystery
is compromised by the lack of any sense
of ‘Hollywood Community’ that was as
much a part of the dream. Knowing
that Marlene Dietrich and Rita Hay-
worth would be rubbing shoulders is a
much more idyllic thought than think-
ing of George Clooney running away
from Paris Hilton.
As for the films, as I’ve already lam-
basted the arbitrariness of the whole
process of awards shows - I could even
go further and shoot myself in the foot
by questioning the need for critics - I
can concede that in a system where
most films being churned out are all-
but-identical, the few that get noticed
probably had something different,
even if it was just an angry Jack Warner
blackmailing the voting Academy.
This is not in any way an interest-
ing, unique or integrity-laden column.
I apologise. It is simply the musing of
a cinephile who fancied a slight diver-
tissement from a pretty boring week
for film. I don’t normally subscribe to
the rose-tinted view of the so-called
Golden Age that people hollowly
praise as another example of how the
world has gone to shit. They certain-
ly don’t make them like they used to.
They make them better. But without
Rita and Marilyn.
in, bombarding everything in its way
and taking the survivors captive. When
Rambo finds out about this tragic turn
of events (probably thinking to him-
self “I told you so”), he agrees to take a
group of mercenaries on a rescue mis-
sion – and the action begins.
The film itself sins a
lot, not only in
terms of
its ethically-charged content, but also
through its almost laughable dialogues
and generally uninventive script. It’s
hard to keep a straight face when Ram-
bo utters things such as “live for noth-
ing, or die for something” and actually
manages to motivate his fellow fight-
ers – it’s just bloody cheesy. But at
ninety minutes running time and
the rather rare occurrences
of such chit-chats, it ends
up being quite bearable,
especially in view of the
majestic payoff at the
end of the film.
The fact is that, over-
all, the movie looks
pretty fancy: either
61-year-old Stallone
hasdevelopedhisflair
in directing, or he’s
got a good cinema-
tographer. The jun-
gle ap-
pears lively and shines beautifully,
reminiscent of Herzog’s (so often
mentioned of late) Aguirre or Fitzcar-
raldo, and I can but wonder whether
it’s just one of those things which have
intrinsic beauty that you simply cannot
miss whenever you point the camera at
them.
As far as violence is concerned, I
don’t believe to have ever seen a film
as viciously bloody as this one. The
body count of three per minute prob-
ably says it all and anyone would have a
hard job arguing that so much aggres-
siveness and bloodshed is justifiable.
But then again, you know what you’re
going into when entering the cinema to
watch Rambo and Stallone does have
an actual reasoning behind the exces-
siveness of it all - in that he acknowl-
edges the need to exaggerate nowadays
in order for anyone to take note. Some
will concede that the message the film
bears is worth it - others undoubtedly
won’t - but in the end, there is little un-
certainty as to what this movie is about
and why it ever came to be.
Stallone knows how to demonise
“the enemy” to the maximum extent
possible and I doubt there have been
many foes that behave so horren-
dously throughout the history of
film. There is no grey in the world
around Rambo, but there is – or
at least should be – a lot of grey
in Rambo. Stallone does not of-
fer much real insight into the
man’s troubled soul, although
it’s quite clear that today’s pro-
tagonist is no longer the same
version of the frustrated, mis-
placed protagonist of First Blood.
This leaves Rambo rather barren
for a spiritual quest, so all that re-
mains is an exercise in vengeance,
which works on its own as far as it
does not try to philosophize.
Fundamentally, in the same man-
ner in which Rocky found a more
poetic last stint, Rambo redefined its
own violent lyricism into the epitome
of what the series is all about: universal
justice.
That is, if there can be such a thing as
violent lyricism.
