Preparing your body for a match
whether it is varsity rugby, football
or underwater wrestling is extremely
important as it can enhance and in-
crease your performance. The physical
demands of match-play will rely heav-
ily on your carbohydrate stores and so
good nutritional practices should be
an essential part of self-preparation in
your sport.
Players who eat well during the
training week are likely to have ade-
quate carbohydrate stores to last them
through a match. Do this by increas-
ing your intake of carbohydrates such
as cereal, bread, honey, jam, potatoes,
rice, pasta etc for a few days prior to
the match and try to spread your food
and drink over 5-6 smaller portioned
meals a day. Avoid the intake of high
fats such as cheese, rich sauces, takea-
ways, crisps and chocolate. Also try to
increase the amount of fluids you take
such as water, sports drinks (4-8% car-
bohydrate), cordial and juices. As your
muscle stores water as well as glyco-
gen. You should avoid alcohol 24-48
hours before a match.
Eat a high carbohydrate meal the
night before the match such as:
• Pasta with a tomato based or low
fat sauce with a small amount of lean
meat, chicken or fish if desired.
• Stir-fry with lots of rice, noodles or
couscous. – Homemade not from your
local takeaway!
• Small serving of very lean meat,
chicken or fish with plenty of potatoes
and vegetable/salad.
Approximately 4-5 hours before the
match eat a suitable pre-match meal.
Choose something that is easily digest-
ible and also something you have eaten
before consisting of carbohydrates
and fluids. Examples are cereals, fruit,
bread, muffins, crumpets, pancakes
with honey, jam or syrup, pasta or rice
with a low fat topping. Small snacks
such as fruit, bread or a meal replace-
ment drink can be consumed up to 2
hours before the match kick off.
Fluid intake should not be under-
estimated as dehydration will impair
skill and judgement and makes exer-
cise seem harder than it actually is.
You need to start each game hydrated
and work at drinking fluid regularly
throughout the game e.g. breaks in
play, time outs etc. Avoid excess caf-
feine before the match as it may lead
to dehydration and cause stomach
cramps.
Recovery is just as important as the
preparation and will ensure you can be
fully ready for your next training ses-
sion. Recovery should start immedi-
ately after the final whistle blows by re-
placing your carbohydrate stores with
fluids and food such as sports drinks,
cordials, fruits – watermelon, pineap-
ple, white bread sandwiches and some
cereal bars.
Sensible intake of alcohol after a
match will not impair future per-
formances but be aware that drinking
alcohol before following a suitable re-
covery plan can compromise recovery
and drinking excessive alcohol can
decrease attempts to improve body
composition.
To complete a full recovery, eat a
proper meal containing carbohydrate-
rich foods such as potatoes, pasta, rice,
noodles etc with some protein such as
chicken, meat or fish. Remember that
fast foods such as chicken kebab and
chips may taste good but are high in
fat – even with the salad, so not at all
useful for your recovery.
Good luck to all teams for next week’s
varsity matches!

Dear Felix Sports Editor,
The following text was found on scrap paper lying on a First-
GreatWestern train service this Wednesday. From the variations
in handwriting it appears that some fellow students of yours com-
posed it one bit at a time. Being somewhat nicer and saucier than
our usual dose of free papers to litter, I thought I may forward
this to you.
Yours faithfully,
Rolling stock cleaning dept. rep – Paddington railway station.
“ Once upon a time...
IC Women’s volleyball team travelled to Plymouth and discov-
ered that ...
It was going to take another 20 minutes to get to the toilet! But
then the team setter discovered that ...
She had forgotten to put pants on ...
The team became worried that the combination of Plymouth,
no pants on and the existence of only two toilets to serve the 7
girls on the team before the match and the over-inflated balls we
took with us might cause a difficulty in getting our gear on fast!
...
After solving those multiple difficulties the team settled into
their hyperactive warm up, intimidating the opposition with the
chanting of one-two-three IC! ...
But who can lose a game when the reward is chocolate! ...
We got our chocolate... along with jacket potato + cheese,
eclairs, beer and more chocolate :-) ...
One-woo-three-IC
Lunch will be for free!
One-two-three-Marjon
We took you on & won ”
