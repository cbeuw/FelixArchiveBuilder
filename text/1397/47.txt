Virgo
Whilst she is beating
the shit out of you,
she sets he 12 semi-
feral children upon
you. They sniff out
your wallet and then
begin ripping it from all its contents like a
pack of hyenas would tear down a carcass in a
matter of seconds. You begin to question the
good will of your new-found biological family,
especially when they start pulling out your
hair claiming that they needed new clothes.
Scorpio
This week when you
rest your head on
your pillow at night,
there is a bleeding,
sharp, pulsing
sensation behind
your right eye. You feel like blood is going to
gush from your nose and whenever you move
your head, a rattling sensation overcomes you.
The pain is unbearable so you decide to chop
your ears off to release the tension. You do a
Charlie Chaplin dance: awesome-a-saurus.
Libra
Lately you have been
having doubts in
your own ability to
interact with other
human beings. You
think the solution is
during conversation is when the conversation
no longer is about you, you set yourself on fire
and then running around flailing. You try this
out unfortunately on the same day you wear a
shell-suit. This puts you in a very bad mood.
Sagittarius
Tridents. Wonder-
ful things aren’t
they. Almost like a
pitchfork but with
extra points of death
on the end. I like to
thrust them into rotting cow carcasses. The
smell of the pungent fetid aroma wafts up your
nose as you spit roast the unlucky animal.
Guilty as charged: next stop, beef burger pack-
aging and then the barbecue grill. Watch the
coals. The spider rises at dawn. Tango down.
Capricorn
The office is
surprisingly busy
for a Thursday
afternoon. There’s
a bit of a barney
going on but we’re
all pretty cool peeps down here, so they’ll be
no arguing. If you’re reading this Chris, you’re
reading about the moment in time when I
started writing about you. I won’t mention
how I looked you up and down though.
Cancer
... finish up by all
shitting on the floor
and rolling round in
it. They then pause,
get up and take a
bow. The talent
agent catches his breath not understanding
what just took place, whether it is real or
purely imagined. The talent agent said, “Erm,
what are you going to call the act?” The family
in unison reply, “The Aristocrats.”
Gemini
... the son to shit
on his dad’s dick
whilst sucking off
the dog. The father
then wheels out his
wheel-chair ridden
daughter and then pushes over the wheel-chair
so the girl spills out onto the floor. The family
then begin to beat the disabled daughter
helplessly lying on the floor with baseball bats
with nails in. The dog is then forced to fuck
the disabled, bloody and helpless girl. They...
Leo
This week you
find out you were
adopted. You then
trace back your
biological mother.
She is called
Sloppykunt McShit and born in Sunderland,
apparently you have 12 biological siblings
all with names like Shitstain, Assblast and
Dickcrumbs. You decide to go see your real
mother. Upon meeting her at the train station
she then begins to beat the shit out of you.
Taurus
So a family walk
into a talent agent’s
office. The father
says to the agent,
“We’ve got a new
act. Let us show
you.” The dad then starts fucking his son in the
ass whilst the mother shits in her daughter’s
mouth whilst singing ‘Jerusalem’. The daughter
then pisses on the floor, the dog then pisses on
the floor, the mother then begins to drink all
of the piss. This all causes...
Aries
You are probably
wondering why the
Horoscopes are
being all negative
this week. Well,
I’m tired of you all,
really mega-fucking tired. I want you to feel
positive about something this week. Embrace
humanity; tell someone you think they look
beautiful and just enjoy the smile on their face.
Talk about your favourite book, ANYTHING.
Pisces
...but you fucking
blew it. RIP Good
Will, 1833-2008.
On a lighter note, you find out that in this
world, it is not what you know, but who you
know. You die alone.
H to the o, r, o, sizzle copes – it’s the Horoscopes
Aquarius
This week you don’t
want to pay for your
education but you
want everyone else
at different universi-
ties doing ‘mickey
mouse’ courses to pay for their degrees. Well-
fucking-done you snobby pigfuckers – I hope
you get David Cameron and Boris Johnson
and all those cunts elected so that you can en-
joy your fetid existence together knowing that
you had the chance to do something good...

Needy McNeedy: distinguishing woes since 1666
L
ooking at the state of the
student body, it becomes
clear to me that you’re all
painfully in need of some
good advice. You’ve got
two options: you could get depressed
and turn to drugs, or you could email
me on agony.felix@imperial.ac.uk. I
promise that I won’t be mean to you, or
if I am, then you definitely deserve it.
Dear Needy Mc Needy
Due to an addiction to clothes and cof-
fee, I’m running out of money! It’s only
half way through the term and already
I’ve discovered that I’ll no longer be able
to finance any drinks or social events.
Is it really possible to live on a fiver a
day?
BrokePerson
Dear BrokePerson,
I’ve tried living on £5 per day. I find
it impossible, although someone sug-
gested you can buy a sandwich from
the JCR for 65p. After some market
research I discovered that this is actu-
ally true (ham and mustard anyone?)
although it is a sandwich in the loosest
sense of the word, and not one you’d
really want to eat. Going out should be
easier; try entering some of the night-
life competitions (you’re virtually guar-
anteed a prize – Greg might even buy
you a drink for texting him) or, if you
can stomach none of the above sug-
gestions, find a rich but socially inept
person looking for some friends.

Dear Needy Mc Needy
I’m really shy but have a hopeless crush
on one of the girls in my course. She sits
near the front of the lecture theatre and
has the most beautiful brown glossy
hair I’ve ever seen. I can’t concentrate
anymore, I just stare at her beautiful
neck. I think I’m in love. I’ve tried talk-
ing to her before but I go bright red and
can’t seem to get the words out. How do
I tell her how I feel?
Lovestruck
Dear Lovestruck,
Firstly, please make sure that at all
times you aren’t gazing at her in a way
as to make anyone but those who fre-
quent the SciFi library painfully aware
that you like her. If you’ve already been
doing this, I propose that you don’t tell
her and save both you and her the em-
barrassment of your rejection. She’ll
thank you for it one day. If, however,
she doesn’t already know of your love,
then buy some of that green make up
(make up? I mean lotion. MALE LO-
TION.) from Boots which is specifi-
cally designed to cover up blushing. Or
just swallow your pride and ask her for
a drink. And when she says yes, don’t
take her to the Union.

Dear Needy McNeedy
I’m a final year student and I’m wor-
ried about getting a job next year. Eve-
ryone else seems to have their careers
lined up in front of them, all my friends
are going to work for investment banks
and the only thing I’ve got lined up this
summer is cleaning my mum’s windows
at home. How can I find the job of my
dreams with minimum effort?
ProspectiveJobSeekersAllowanceRe-
cipitant
Dear ProspectiveJobSeekersAllow-
anceRecipitant
Repeat the mantra after me: I will have
an Imperial degree, I will get a job. I’m
sure you’re not alone in realising its
not that easy; employers aren’t going
to drag you out of bed by the right leg
and push you towards a desk. Oh no,
it turns out you’ve actually got to go
and ask to be given a life of commuting
and drudgery. Unfortunately for you,
sabb nominations are over now, so you
can’t put off the inevitable by spending
a year debating the finer points of the
Union Constitution. Never mind.
Needy xxx
Dear Needy McNeedy
I’m addicted to celebrity gossip sites.
They’re just so much easier to read than
textbooks. It’s ruining my degree. How
can I give them up?
TheInternetIsForCoolKidsToo
Dear TheInternetIsForCoolKidsToo
Give them up? What are you talking
about? This is probably the best life ex-
perience you can hope for. If anything,
give up your degree, which is probably
in something completely pointless like
the geophysical topography of the out-
er hemisphere of mars. Being literate
in pop culture is a rare skill at Imperial,
make the most of it.
