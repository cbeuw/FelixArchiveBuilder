Games
ing a Boss character. It’s a little annoy-
ing, but fortunately the encounters can
often make it more than worth your
time.
Devil May Cry has also been charac-
terised by particularly memorable and
deliciously difficult boss battles. Simi-
larly, each fracas here boasts visually
arresting design and resilient yet grati-
fying combat. Now, maybe it’s just that
I’ve played a lot of the demo and/or I’ve
played Devil May Cry 3 quite a bit but
I didn’t find the first boss – the fiery
demon Berial – particularly challeng-
ing. I was actually quite disappointed
to have won in the first round without
getting hit. In retrospect, DMC3’s Cer-
berus handed my ass back to me more
times than I can bear to reveal. It’s a lit-
tle annoying at first but the game does
pick up in challenge (with some annoy-
ingly uneven spikes) later on.
To help those along, the game con-
tinues presenting certain Hidden Mis-
sions. These are intense, focused extra
levels that adhere a somewhat strict
objective for victory and as a result,
harken back to the difficulty heights of
old. Granted, while some are quite ex-
citing, the remainder can be just frus-
trating beyond belief.
Now, this isn’t all about Nero hog-
ging the sinister limelight since Dante
is about Devil May Cry as much as the
games are about him. It’s not too long
after you start getting cosy with Nero
that the original badass comes back in
action, replete with leather chaps and
more deliciously corny one-liners that
you can shake an entire Kellogg’s fac-
tory at. Since he’s is no longer the main
focus, it’s almost like his very presence
is a blessing and that’s why he com-
pensates with an assload of new arma-
ments that can only be the result of the
designer downing more than one’s fair
share of saké.
While you may end up running back
to the sword Rebellion for nostalgia’s
sake there’s no denying that Messrs’
Lucifer and Gilgamesh and a certain
Miss Pandora’s Box (all the names of
his new weapons) offer some excit-
ing new options wherein the word
insane is often juxtaposed with under-
statement. While it may seem a little
anachronistic, he also retains his major
‘Styles’ from DMC3 which can be in-
terchanged with the correct D-pad di-
rections. Mid-combo weapon switch-
ing is pretty damn cool but switching
Styles? Depending on your preferences
you might as well stick to a particular
augmentation, only switching when it’s
safe to move your thumb off of the An-
alog Stick. However, the option is com-
mended for being present either way.
Yeah. I really, really like this game.
And why not? Besides all these quali-
ties, the game is a true embodiment of
best qualities of the first and third iter-
ations and that is what fans have pretty
much desired since the trailers teased
us two years prior. It’s atmospheric
and visuals come across as stunning,
sharp and all manner of other positive
superlatives.
But alas, all is not as shiny as the
reflections off of the windows in this
game. While the game invariable de-
sires to recall the greatest moments in
the series’, it also often flounders when
it fails to reach them. It may be in sub-
jective view but I fail to see characters
ascolourfulandpersonableasArkham/
Jester, Vergil and Trish (who makes a
short-lived return). Similarly the plot
in the last game comes across as much
more focused and with a stronger (only
comparitively) emphasis on character
development. Of course, that could be
just the horrible, horrible memories of
the putrid animated series, but there
is something lacking about the overall
impetus to your journey that the other
games possessed. The constant flaunt-
ingoftheoppositesex
in various positions
of, erm, unrest are
similarly grating. And
the ultimate fail is simply
that DMC4 doesn’t represent a para-
digm shift that the Resident Evil series’
experienced with its fourth official ver-
sion. There is quite a bit of backtracking
when playing as Dante which reeks of
the developer taking shortcuts as well
as some suspect puzzle portions that
get very old very quickly. Just further-
ing the misery are an unwieldy camera
inherited from its forebears and a sur-
prisingly long install on the PlayStation
3 hard-drive, although the series’ recap
was rather enjoyable.
But who gives a damn.
Devil May Cry has always been
about grabbing the Devil by the balls
and then swinging him around in ways
that makes nunchuk masters blush
with embarrassment. Devil May Cry
4 is cheesy, it’s hard, it’s gorgeous and
above all the else, the gameplay is still
unmatched in terms of unabridged,
uncomprised and unrestrained style
that’s as deep and downright satisfying
as it appears to spellbound onlookers.
And it’s damn good to be wielding your
old friends Ebony and Ivory yet again.
Devil Arms
The first boss fight against Berial
is a great way to put most of your
skills to use. It’s also a fun way of
witnessing the true potential of
your nascent Devil Bringer.
Besides helping with grappling
puzzles, the Devil Bringer is a
clever offensive tool. It allows
you to close the gap between en-
emies (in this case, by bringing
you closer to its weak point).
Here, once you’ve dealt suf-
ficient damage and snuffed out
the crimson flames, it becomes
possible to either lift the great
demon into the air and then slam
him downwards or send him fly-
ing with a massive uppercut.
As you’ll notice further on, your
Devil Bringer actions differ from
enemy to enemy so it’s some-
times handier to pick up one
type of foe that can be hurled
into into others to create some
breathing space. Remember: the
game is about creating your own
epic niche in combat.
Devil Bringer
Alastor
Ebony and Ivory
Nothing beats the trusty old
combination of the electricity
imbued Alastor and the rapid-
fire handguns Ebony & Ivory.
However, being characterised
by insane weapons, Devil May
Cry always affords you plenty
of interesting choices.
Cerberus
Nevan
The tri-headed flails/nunchuks
Cerberus and the, well, guitar
Nevan were unique additions
to Devil May Cry 3. The former
allows a great deal of freeform
comboes with attacks imbued
by the element of ice. Nevan
stands as more of an enigma.
It’s a rather difficult weapon
to use in that you play it rath-
er than attack directly. There
are some particularly brilliant
moves when using the Sword-
master style. Weirdly, it allows
you to summon electrified bats
that deal damage. Er...
Nero’s personal com-
bination of the Red
Queen (left) and Blue
Rose are quite potent.
The Red Queen can be
revved up like a motor-
bike in order to build up
energy that is unleashed
in a whirlwind of fierce
flames. The ability to In-
stant Rev (IR) in between
combos is a tough skill
to master. While the Blue
Rose (below) shoots rather
slowly, it makes do with
stopping power.
Nero’s Arsenal
Nero lays the smackdown on the re-imagined Frosts (circa DMC); they’re easier but somewhat cheaper
The newbie’s attempt at ass-grabbing Dante will probably be met with a sword cleaved through his skull
