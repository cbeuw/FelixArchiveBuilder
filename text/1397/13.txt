Sabbatical Elections – Voting
Now Open
Isn’t democracy empowering? You’ve
met the candidates and read their
manifestos and now it is decision time.
Voting is now open on the Union website
and will close at 23.50 on Tuesday.
Check out the elections coverage in
Felix and then decide who you would
like to run your Union next year. Our
8 NUS delegate positions are also
hotly contested so have a quick read
of their views and vote to decide who
Imperial College Union will be sending
to join me in the Dickensian squalor of
Blackpool Wintergardens for NUS Annual
Conference 2008 from 1-3 April 2008.
Even if your chosen candidate
dosen’t win your vote still
counts!
So by now you have probably been
harassed by several different candidates
and having made an informed decision
about who would be the best set of
people to lead our Union next year you
want to get on with casting your vote.
Voting online is a very easy process and
can be done at
imperialcollegeunion.org/vote.
All Union elections are run using the
system of Single Transferable Vote
(STV) as recommended by the Electoral
Reform Society as being the most
democratic way of counting votes. I
will not bore you with the intricacies of
STV but should you wish to learn more
there is lots of material available on the
internet.
When voting you will be asked to rank
the candidates numerically with the
candidate you put a “1” by being your
favourite. If your preferred candidate is
eliminated then your second preference
is taken in to account and so on and
so forth. What this means is that it is
important to assess all the candidates
and ask your self the question “if X
doesn’t win then who else do I think
would be quite good?” Remember,
these elections are so hotly contested
that some of the posts could be decided
by transferred votes so please remember
to indicate who you would like to win if
your chosen candidate should fail. Re-
open Nominations (dear old RON) stands
fully seconded in all Union elections
so if you think that all or some of the
candidates are not up to it then you are
free to put RON in your rankings as you
see fit.
Vote in ALL the elections and
get 50p for a club of your
choice
The Union is stronger with higher
turnout in Officer elections so as an
additional incentive for you to log on to
the electronic ballot box you have the
opportunity to raise a bit of extra money
for your favourite society. If you vote in
all the NUS Delegate, Student Trustee
and Sabbatical Officer elections you get
to allocate 50p to one of the Union’s
several hundred clubs. 50p might not
sound a lot but it soon adds up if lots of
you vote.
