Ryan Dee
A
ny person who runs for
DPEW needs to really
care about their fellow
students’ welfare. The
role is about helping to
remove the barriers, be they financial
or emotional, which stop students do-
ing their best while at Imperial. It is a
role I would really love to take on, not
for some power trip, but because I en-
joy helping my peers.
I’ve had some difficult times while at
Imperial and have benefited from the
support of my fellow students and the
welfare services the College and the
Union have provided. There is always
room for improvement however. For
example, we need personal tutors who
have an interest in student welfare,
who receive more training and who
are proactive in making sure students
feel comfortable to come to them with
problems.
Money’s always a worry for any stu-
dent which is why I want to review
the pricing of halls, make it easier for
students to find appropriate jobs and
look at improving uptake of bursary
schemes. Promoting good health is
important as well by, for example, im-
proving bicycle facilities.
As president of I.Q. (the Union’s
LGBT society) last year, I was able to
be directly involved with students’
welfare. It was great to see that I was
helping to make other students’ time
at Imperial a happy one. I’ve enjoyed
getting involved with our Union and
I hope you will give me the opportu-
nity to stay involved and to improve
the quality of life for Imperial students.
Vote Dee for DPEW.

O
ver the past four years
I’ve become a familiar
face around the union;
I have driven Felix edi-
tors mad with my hap-
hazard editing skills, worked with pre-
vious Union Presidents and DPEWs on
‘Greening Imperial’, culminating in a
new Environmental Policy and an an-
nual Green Week and helped organise
events such as the 1st Ethical Careers
Fair. I have also sat on Union Council
and the Representation and Welfare
Board in my role as Welfare Cam-
paigns Officer.
As DPEW, I’d be an approachable
and friendly port of call for students.
I’d like to:
• Work with college on training of
personal tutors to make sure students
are receiving a universally high level of
support and advice.
• Involve more clubs and societies
with the running of Welfare Cam-
paigns including SHAG and Healthy
Living weeks.
• Trial a new mums and dads scheme
during freshers week, linking older
students with younger ones so advice
and resources are shared throughout
the years and to help newer students
integrate quickly.
• Improve links between year and
departmental educational reps so that
important issues filter up to the level of
the Union and onto the College.
• Continue Kirsty’s Welfare pages in
Felix on academic and welfare issues
including advice on finance, health,
student life and the network of stu-
dent support services that are available
around college.
Next year, when not in college meet-
ings, my door will be open for students
to come in and share any ideas and
concerns over a cup of tea!

RON Weasley
S
o, I’ve just been disturbed
from my slumber by those
fools in the Union who beat
me in the elections this time
last year. They’re expecting
me to be RON again this year after the
humiliation I endured losing to them?
Unfortunately, in paragraph 4, line
32 of the Student Stupidity Protocol it
states: “All RON mascots are obliged
to campaign whenever the Union sees
fit, lest they suffer deformation of their
personage.” My red locks are far too
precious! Alas, The Weasley is forced
to return.
Anyway, this year’s bunch of wan-
nabes are just as useless as last year’s
candidates. If you like any of them,
take a long hard look at your life and
consider rehab. If you don’t like any of
them vote RON in the elections – it
makes sense, you probably just don’t
know it yet.
If you vote for The Weasley not only
will I ensure Phase 2 of the Beit Rede-
velopment is delivered before my term
has even started, I’ll add three more
phases to the Masterplan including:
rocket boosters under Beit Quad so
that it levitates 50m off the ground, the
entire demolition of the West Base-
ment with Australia as a replacement
and our very own star to ensure a
regulated temperature of 18.89 de-
grees Celsius throughout the Union.
All without breaking a sweat.
As for Felix: burn it all. Every
student will be given an owl or fly-
ing squirrel which will tell them the
horoscopes or whatever they want
on request.
On a serious note: You can vote
for RON if you don’t think any
candidate is suitable. RON runs
against all the candidates and
electing RON will restart that
strand of elections only.
You’ve read the Sabb manifestos, now vote!
