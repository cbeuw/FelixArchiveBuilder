Luke Taylor
M
y manifest is very
simple; I intend to
bring a new wave of
common sense lead-
ership to ICU, whilst
ensuring that the correct procedures
are in place to maintain an effective
Union administration. Too often great
plans, new clubs, events and initiatives
are stifled by Union bureaucracy and
individual incompetence, and I prom-
ise to instigate a more common sense,
‘can-do’ attitude to Student Politics
than has been done in the past. There
are no metrics I can promise you for
this, but my approach in Chairing the
ACC over the past two years, and be-
ing treasurer for the Rugby club has
always been based on common sense
and ‘can-do’ rather than endless rheto-
ric and pontificating.
Elect Luke Taylor as President and I
will;
• Ensure that we get value for money
from NUS. Initially a cynic and sup-
porter of the No campaign in the ref-
erendum, I will fight to ensure that we
receive the required support and serv-
ices for our money!
• Continue my existing work with
College on developing the Sporting
opportunities available to students,
and making this task a much larger
part of the remit of the DPCS than it
currently is.
• Push through Phase 2 of the Union
redevelopment, ensuring that environ-
mental questions are answered, and
that the facilities are fit for purpose, i.e.
a Students Union, not an office block.
• Ensure proper representation for
Postgraduate students after the farce
that was the GSA this year.
Remember, Vote Taylor ‘08 for a Pos-
itive Change!
UNION
PRESIDENT
FELIX
EDITOR
Greg Mead
I
’m Greg and I’ve been work-
ing for Felix since my first year
in 2004. I’ve edited music and
nightlife sections for the past
three years.
This year, I’m proud to say I’ve been
involved in what I believe has been the
most successful and consistent Felix
during my time at Imperial but that
being said, things can always be im-
proved. My goal would be primarily
to increase the student participation
in the paper as at this time almost all
the editors are in their final year so it is
essential to attract new blood to main-
tain the current quality of articles.
Currently I believe medical students
for one are under represented in Felix,
and one of my campaign points will be
to improve this, not only by printing
and delivering more copies of Felix to
the medical campuses but by creating
a new section and editorial position for
medics.
General student participation can
be greatly improved if Felix taps more
into the valuable list of contacts that
has been built up over the years, who
are more than willing to organise com-
petitions, events and bar-nights for
students throughout the term.
As a final point, every year the Felix
editor candidates promise to rebuild
the website, I have real experience in
this field and can actually make this
happen. I will create a fully working
site before the end of the summer, with
student access to all past issues of Fe-
lix since 1949. Visit http://votegreg.

points.
Jovan Nedić
I
’m Jovan, the current sports edi-
tor for Felix. I’ve seen Felix go
through several reincarnations;
from Dave Edwards’ sensible
year, to Rupert Neat’s contro-
versial, yet highly addictive issues, to
Andy Sykes relaxed issues. This year I
believe Tomo has managed to obtain a
good mixture of all three, but I believe
that it can still be improved. Cosmeti-
cally, very few changes will be made
in order to maintain Felix’s identity.
However, in terms of content, changes
will be made, with Coffee Break be-
ing brought back properly along with
all it’s comedy writers and more Page
3. Competitions and prizes will be re-
turned to encourage student participa-
tion, particularly for the Sports League,
crosswords and puzzles.
he serious side of Felix, however, will
not be sidelined. The news will range
from the hard hitting to the light heart-
ed, comments will give the opportu-
nity for people to express their views,
but most importantly, I want students
to think of Felix as the place to turn
when no one listens to them about col-
lege problems.
My main aim however is with the
internet.
• I want current issues to be online
before the next issue is released.
• I want to develop the website so
that reviews can be easily stored and
accessed
• I want to begin to digitally archive
previous editions, beginning with the
very first issue of Felix, so that peo-
ple can see how students views have
changed.
So if you like what you hear, vote for
Jov.
What will you get from the
NUS to make our membership
worthwhile?
I can’t see much gained from the NUS
so far apart from the obvious NUS Ex-
tra cards and legal advice on Constitu-
tional changes we’ve had to make. But
at the moment it’s hard for me to say
what we gain because I haven’t had ac-
cess to what the NUS provides.
When we go to the Annual Confer-
ence we need to make sure that the
NUS’ structure is shaped to some-
thing Council feels is a worthwhile
structure.
Do you feel you’re truly represent-
ative in your views of the student
body, or do you think you’re too
closely associated with a clique?
I may well be closely associated with
the sports side of things having been
ACC Chair but I have also been in-
volved in the welfare side of things as
year rep in Aeronautics.
At the start of my campaign I spoke
to many different people from all back-
grounds to ascertain whether I had any
support whatsoever. I found that the
backing came from generally active
students rather than just [sport clubs].
What do you think of the Beit Mas-
terplan so far?
So far there have been successes and
questions over whether it’s value for
money. I realise the first phase was
mostly influenced by regulations over
disability access and things like that
and so there wasn’t so much of a scope
to give benefits to all students. With the
phase two there are much more tangi-
ble benefits to all the students such as
the new Student Activities Centre, the
gym changes and new dance studio.
Can you make dB’s a credible ven-
ue and how?
dB’s is currently a very credible venue.
A good night out isn’t entirely depend-
ant on the venue rather the quality of
the entertainments and crowd. Peo-
ple get too hung up on the fact that
the facilities aren’t first class, yet on a
Wednesday nights 500 people have a
fantastic time.
When the opportunity does arrive
to refurbish, we need to make sure we
make use of the consultation period as
much as we can to nail down what we
want, first time around.
Live! has described “an entrenched
attitude that certain things are op-
erational issues”, which prevents
elected officers getting things
done. How would you tackle this
to push through the changes you
want to make?
My manifesto reflects my ‘can do’ atti-
tude to politics. My major change to the
role would be to apply common sense
rather than hide behind regulations.
It’s important to have accountabil-
ity but you mustn’t hang someone out
to dry if they make a genuine effort at
something and it doesn’t go quite as
well as planned.
On what timescale can we expect
your promises to be delivered?
I think the promises are for your term.
You cannot go about changing the way
things are done overnight.
You may make promises that ulti-
mately aren’t achievable but as long
as you are doing the best you can, you
shouldn’t be pulled up for not deliver-
ing on one of your manifesto points.
Where do you stand on the Higher
Education funding debate?
It’s madness to campaign for free edu-
cation now. Personally I think it’s im-
portant and sensible to keep the cap.
What do you think about the Un-
ion’s current regulations govern-
ing the student media?
It’s important the SSP is in place. I’ve
not had extensive day-to-day dealings
with it but as I see it, it’s too unclear.
Maybe the relationship between the
Sabb team and Felix hasn’t been good
enough to allow a reasonable conversa-
tion about what can and can’t be print-
ed, which is as I see it, why last week’s
Felix came to fruition.
Are you Ken or Boris?
I’m a Ken; he makes things happen.
Political Hack or Corporate Sell-
out?
Pseudo-hack: I know the lingo but I’m
not entrenched in the political games.
