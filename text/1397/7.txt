I
’ve always been involved in a
wide range of clubs, includ-
ing ACC Dance, Dance Com-
pany, Medics Music and Choir.
I’ve been on the committees of
Medics Music and Dance Company for
two years and been the chair of Artsoc
and Dramsoc. This year I’ve also been
the Social Clubs Committee Chair,
looking after lots of other societies, as
well as sitting on central Union com-
mittees such as the Clubs and Socie-
ties Board, Council and the Executive
Committee.
During my time as a club officer and
through working in the Student Ac-
tivities Centre for 4 years, I’ve come
face-to-face with a lot of the things
that frustrate clubs. I would develop
an online room booking system for
checking room availability and book-
ing College rooms, making life much
easier for clubs.
Club finances can still be a major
source of confusion. I would ensure
that club officers don’t get their budg-
ets frozen without warning and that
they have adequate access to Finance
Support staff. I would push for more
part-time staff to help ensure that the
online transaction pages are up-to-date
and would have ongoing club training
throughout the year.
If elected, I would make changes that
would have a real difference for the
clubs and societies at Imperial, the stu-
dents who put so much time and effort
into running them and the students
who participate in club activities. No
gimmicks, just real, practical things.
I also promise to ensure there is a
working bike pump attached to the
Beit bicycle racks.

John James
I
am studying Civil Engineering
and am currently in my third
year. I spend most of my time
maintaining the RCS and RSM
motorised mascots, after being
Chairman of RCSMC for two years. I
am a member of Choir, the University
Royal Naval Unit, and in my time at
Imperial I have been across the chan-
nel with Yacht Club, helped to found
Cheese Society, and been Vice Chair-
man of RAG.
I have attended council since my
first year and I have attended Clubs
and Societies Board, Health and Safety
Committee and Exec. Having taken a
year in industry, I am committed to
working above and beyond forty hours
a week and being Lord Mayor’s Show
Coordinator has shown that I am no
stranger to big events.
If elected I will:
Hold a Refreshers’ Fair in the spring
term. This will give students a second
chance to join summer clubs such as
cricket, and also to reflect on which
clubs they really want to be members
of after the chaos of the first term.
Hold an Inter-Faculty Sports day.
This will strengthen Faculty Union re-
lations while promoting a healthy com-
petitive rivalry. I will support Faculty
Union autonomy in providing sporting
activities that their members can get
involved in.
IntroduceFast-trackfinancetraining.
An online finance test for club officers
would unfreeze their budget without
the need to attend finance training.
Only Officers who fail the test would
need to attend training.

Jess Marley
I
’m Jess Marley, a final year Maths
student from Cardiff! I have
been elected as Netball Club
Captain for the past 2 years and
have represented the Union for
the 1st team, and take an active role in
the social side of the club. I was also a
Re-App at Fisher Hall last year.
In my role as Netball Club Captain,
I’ve gained valuable experience of how
clubs and societies work and what
Club Committees in particular need
from their Sabbs and other Union offi-
cials. This has given me a great under-
standing of what general members of
clubs and societies expect to gain from
the Union, whether they’re students
who take their club very seriously or
just want a bit of fun and to socialise
with new people. During this time
I’ve built a solid working relationship
with the members of the Sport Impe-
rial team. I feel this relationship is very
important because the role of DPCS
requires strong links with the depart-
ment to obtain maximum benefit to
both parties.
As DPCS I intend to:
• Work for ALL members of ALL
clubs and societies in OUR Union
• Improve the link between our Un-
ion and Sport Imperial
• Re-assess the way new clubs and
societies are formed
• Give clubs and societies more op-
portunity to promote themselves
• Fight to retain free gym and swim
facilities for all students
• Bring competence and consistency
to our Union
For an organised, well managed and
fun Union – VOTE JESS DPCS!!
