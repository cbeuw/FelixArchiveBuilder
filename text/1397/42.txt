W
hen somebody
thinks of ninjas,
one of two major
archetypes pops
into their head.
Sometimes its the timid, stealthy nin-
jas that can't cleave their way into
an action game even if they were up
against a small army of potted plants.
Other times, however, people imag-
ine the brutish killing machines that
are capable of using a combination of
speed, shurikens and crazy sword skills
to solve any problem they may come
across. Ryu Hayabusa of Ninja Gaiden
fame is one such ninja.
Ninja Gaidens style of stealth is
shown in the first chapter of the game
that sees you infiltrating a rogue ninja
fortress to look for information, and
by infiltrating I mean strolling down
corridors killing any living being that
dares draw breath near you. Fighting
ninja after ninja in the first chapter, the
basics of combat in the game become
important to learn as well as the cru-
cial differences in the game when com-
pared to other 3d action games have
to be noticed before you get killed in a
shiny storm of katanas and shurikens.
Unlike other action mainstays like
Dynasty Warriors or Devil May Cry,
combat in Ninja Gaiden doesn't focus
on long, flowing combos or snazzy aer-
ial attacks to keep yourself safe from
the grunts cursing below but instead
on a complex system of evading enemy
attacks while trying to capitalize on
weaknesses in your opponents move-
ments (a little tricky when there's often
4+ enemies at your throat at any one
time). This strangely defensive style of
combat isn't one to catch an onlookers
eye immediately but the poetic nature
of the dance of death in Ninja Gaiden
does offer its own merits.
The evasive nature of combat is not
entirely Ryu Hayabusas fault, but the
foes you meet play a large part in hav-
ing to defend yourself. Gone are the
days when the combo was something
reserved for player characters and
bosses, as even the lowliest enemy is
capable of going toe-to-toe with our
favourite ninja and battering through
his defences with a series of block-
breaking attacks in quick succession.
The enemies relentless assault does
not end with having combos of equal
length to you, but they continue on
with a plentiful supply of throws so
they can skip the block-breaking step
on the road to attacking you. All things
considered, there is not really a lot that
you can do that the majority of op-
ponents cannot. Blocking? Dodging?
Ranged attacks? Basically, the average
opponent isn't far off being some kind
of weird bot, with the added effect of it
being 1 v many most of the time.
Although combat is usually defen-
sive, select weapons in the weapon list
are capable of supporting an offensive
playing style, most notably the Dabi-
lahro (large beserker sword) and the
Lunar (staff) can keep you alive even
while attacking opponents thanks to
their long-range sweeping attacks.
Other weapons such as the faithful
Dragon Sword and the Vigoorian Flails
also promote their own schools of bat-
tle, with the Dragon Sword emphasiz-
ing high movement speeds as many of
its attacks come with their own sweep-
ing dashes attached while the
Flails work on a combina-
tion of relatively long
combos backed up
with some incredibly
fast, high damage
hits to help iso-
late opponents.
The game rarely
forces you into
using a par-
tic-
Here cometh the reaper man
Alex Stubley sneaks in his musings of an old classic, then flips out and kills all
ular weapon in an encounter so it gives
you the freedom to choose a weapon
and master it without having to worry
about suddenly meeting an opponent
that renders your new-found skills
ineffective.
The game also comes complete
with a small, but diverse set of ranged
weapons to help add that little bit of
spice into the already over-seasoned
combats. Broadly speaking the ranged
weapons are either arrows, which can
only be fired while standing still and
can be aimed in first person view for
more precise shots, and the shurikens
which can be thrown at almost any
time. While the bow may be a powerful,
it is rather cumbersome and so takes a
great deal of moderation to use effec-
tively. Shurikens on the other hand do
very little damage and for the most part
are simply an extra little thing to worry
about in combat, but they become a
necessity in later combats as an simple
way to stun an opponent in either self-
defense or to prevent blocking for
an upcoming combo.
Other than
the combat, the game is fairly standard
fare. The story is interesting enough,
the character designs are well done
and the setting is pretty well thought
out such that you never feel out of
place even while running down an
urban street fighting military troop-
ers in full ninja garb. The interfaces in
the game are easy to navigate and the
overall game is highly polished and
streamlined. The learning curve of the
game is also very well plotted out, with
players usually struggling to beat every
new enemy but always having victory
in sight.
But screw minor details, this game
lives and dies by its combat, and its
hard to get sweeter than this. It is my
personal recommendation that any
fans of the 3d platforming action genre
at least give this game a try (PS3 own-
ers can download a demo). Look out for
either Ninja Gaiden Black on the Xbox
Classic or Ninja Gaiden Sigma on the
PS3. Classic? Revolutionary? I don't
know but what I do know
is that there isn't a
better game out
there for sheer
ninja face-
smashery.
Gaiden
Gaiden signifies a side story of
sorts, so I thought it would be
appropriate to discuss some of
the more interesting (subjec-
tive), yet less known aspects
about Devil May Cry.
You all know Resident Evil 4
is one of the finest action-ad-
venture games to have hit the
GameCube and PlayStation 2.
What a lot of you don’t know
is that RE4 would have been
released about sevenish years
ago. Instead, development
took a rather different route.
There was always an intention
for a Hispanic setting since the
development team were sent
to Spain in order to study the
architecture. The basic charac-
ter designs were drawn then,
explaining why both Leon and
Dante need fringe cuts, badly.
However, the team apparent-
ly encountered a strange glitch
that caused enemies to be ef-
fectively juggled as you fired
at them in quick succession.
Instead of trying to solve the
problem, they ran with it.
The gameplay also took on a
more acrobatic, physical route
as emphasis was placed on
combat over exploration.
With a late design decision
to introduce mission-based
gameplay over exploration, the
Devil May Cry you all know and
love came into being.
However, the story doesn’t
end there. In a strange twist of
events, the template for Devil
May Cry (which was RE4’s
to begin with, in all fairness)
now became that of the offi-
cial Resident Evil 4. The sym-
biosis is quite interesting. From
the Hunter-like Blades to the
humungous castle to the es-
sentially on-rails escapade at
the climax of the game, both
games are share much.
