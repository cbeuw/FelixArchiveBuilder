UNION
PRESIDENT
I
am a 22 year old Portuguese
sociable/ huggable 4th year Bio-
medical Engineering student. I
love spending time with friends,
a good laugh, clubbing, (watch-
ing) sports, music, traveling and meet-
ing people; i.e. I experience University
life to the max!
This, together with my previous ex-
periences as Senior Student (Reapp),
Holiday Camp Monitor and founder of
the IC Unofficial Choir, turn me into
a Student listening/ pleasing/ repre-
senting machine sent from the future
to lift up our Union and Student Body
morale.
In my Presidency, I will:
– bring fun and different profiles to
the Union bars and Student body by
organising workshops and more com-
mon events with the medics, Wye
and the Royal Colleges of Art and of
Music.
– get reading weeks and create the
Teacher of the Year award in all the
departments, improving results and
lecturing quality.
– give more funds to departmen-
tal societies and organise career days
within each course in order to help
with professional decisions.
– turn DB’s into an acceptable,
friendly and pleasant place.
– allow post graduate Master stu-
dents into the SCR.
– fight for better catering and more
choice of foods.
– give each society and any student
at Imperial College the opportunity of
their own bar night.
And finally, do whatever I can to
bring the Union decisions and actions
to all the students and not to a selected
few boring and permanent faces. Eve-
ryone will be welcome to come and
propose changes/actions. After all, this
is still a democracy.

I
started Union life dedicated to
enjoying things like sports and
music. After three years, not
only do I continue to enjoy eve-
rything I can, I now hold posi-
tions of responsibility on committees I
feel strongly about.
Imperial College is well known for
producing graduates of the highest
academic standard. However, many
graduate without enjoying a fraction of
what Imperial’s Union has to offer. It’s
the President’s responsibility to fight
‘Imperial Apathy’ in every way pos-
sible. People need to realise that Un-
ion activities aren’t just great fun, but
vastly rewarding. We need to regain
our community spirit and common
identity; people should feel compelled
to support fellow students at their
events.
Students need a voice to speak up
when they have academic issues and,
more importantly, to know that the
Union will support them. As president,
I promise to be that voice.
ICU has lost its’ way as a good night
out, in fact most people are just not
inspired by Union events. It used to at-
tract people from all over London and
it still should! If elected, I will strive to
make the Union a better night out.
There are many issues to address –
from passive smoking to the pitfalls of
a claim form, from beer prices to the
bureaucracy minefield of ICU’s con-
stitution. Furthermore, I know the
president isn’t there to represent his/
her views, but to represent all stu-
dents. If elected, I will represent ALL
students and their views to the best of
my abilities.
Diogo Geraldes didn’t attend his interview because he was in Portugal at the time
What will you get from the
NUS to make our membership
worthwhile?
Imperial’s not your typical university;
it’s not going to have the same needs
etc as other universitites. We need to
shape what the NUS does and how it
works with us to our own particular
needs and not make it a waste of mon-
ey for us.
Do you feel you’re truly represent-
ative in your views of the student
body, or do you think you’re too
closely associated with a clique?
I think this is probably the strongest
point to my campaign. I’m someone
that’s met a lot of people at Imperial.
I’ve played football and rugby and met
a lot of sporty people and I’m also
heavily involved in the musical side of
Imperial. I sing in the choir and play in
the IC Symphony Orchestra who I’ve
organised and been on tours with.
A lot of people focus on the sports
and forget about Imperial’s excellent
musical side, so I think I can represent
both of their needs.
What do you think of the Beit Mas-
terplan so far?
I think it’s really good what Stephen
Brown has done and that what we’ve
done to daVinci’s has made itt more
airy. I think it’s taking a long time but
when it’s finished it’ll be good.
Can you make dB’s a credible ven-
ue and how?
I was speaking to a postgrad who said
they used to have comedy nights in
dB’s that were packed out and I think
it’s something that needs to come back.
I think the venue is alright at the mo-
ment, it just needs to be marketed
better. If you get people to one or two
of the Union’s event they enjoy the
events on offer; not much is required
to change the venue.
Live! has described “an entrenched
attitude that certain things are op-
erational issues”, which prevents
elected officers getting things
done. How would you tackle this
to push through the changes you
want to make?
As a person I like to talk to people face
to face. There is far too much bureauc-
racy at Imperial but I see the need for
it – Imperial needs to be legally sound
– but there’s lots that can be changed.
The room booking system is horren-
dous. It gets backlogged and back-
logged and I think it would be great to
get an online system.
Also, I think many candidates have
policy-after-policy-after-policy when
really you’re there to represent the stu-
dents’ views and as President, you’re
not just there to push through loads of
policies.
On what timescale can we expect
your promises to be delivered?
I don’t have proper policies, I just have
who I am and what I’m about and what
I want to happen, so I’d say straight
away. As soon as I get in I’ll be chang-
ing the Union for the better in the ways
I set out in my manifesto.
Where do you stand on the Higher
Education funding debate?
I’m not sure it’s an entirely relevant
question as the President is repre-
senting the students’ views and I will
be fighting for their views regardless
of mine. However, personally I think
top-up Fees are terrible; I don’t want
students to be paying more money. I
think we’re suffering because the gov-
ernment wants so many people to get
degrees.
What do you think about the Un-
ion’s current regulations govern-
ing the student media?
I don’t know the facts so I can’t give a
complete answer, but I think it’s very
sad our Union is preventing the stu-
dent press from giving the students
the news they would like to have. But
at the same time, you can’t slander
people and you can’t jump down the
staffs’ backs. Overall I’m more liberal
on this; there should be more freedom
of speech than there is.
Are you Ken or Boris?
Boris.
Political Hack or Corporate Sell-
out?
I don’t think I’m either. Definitely not a
Political Hack, so the other one.
