multiplied by 0.033 for the amount of
water you should be drinking in litres a
day. This amount though does not in-
clude water loss from sweating during
exercise so you will need to take into
account this loss and add it on to your
daily requirement.
Along with plenty of bed rest and
good hydration levels examine what
you are eating. Take a look at Holly’s
article for ideas on pre-match nutri-
tion. Finally avoid too much alcohol
consumption over the next few days.
Ideally cut out all alcohol completely,
though I realise this may be hard for
some of you!
On The Day
Aim to get up around 7.00am so
that you have plenty of time to pre-
pare yourself for the day’s big match.
Hopefully you would have had a great
night’s sleep having got to bed before
10.30pm.
Start the day with a big breakfast.
This is one of the times where having
a cooked breakfast will be beneficial to
you as you will need a lot of calories for
the day ahead. Some of you may find
that you have quite a lot of nerves or
excitable energy and so it is a good idea
to eat throughout the day to keep en-
ergy levels up. Also it is often a good
idea to eat more in the morning as you
may find that as the match gets closer
nerves suppress your appetite. There
is nothing worse than trying to force
food down when you are not hungry
when you need some extra energy.
Again focus on your hydration levels
and keep sipping water throughout the
day. If you do decide to perform the
mobility session in the morning make
sure it is early enough to give yourself
plenty of time to eat again and rest for
the match. Finally, remember to give
yourself a good hour before the start
of the match to warm up. A quick five
minute jog is not the best way to get
you prepared to compete at your opti-
mal performance level.

Preparing for Varsity: the
sportsman’s itinerary
Andy Mitchell
Energia Fitness Instructor
Sports league
The biggest sporting event at Imperial
is upon us again. It’s time for the Impe-
rial teams to face up to the Medics and
see who comes out on top. With five
days to go, all of you taking part have
hopefully already been preparing your-
selves. If you haven’t do not panic there
is still lots you can do over the next few
days to get ready.
Building up to Varsity
To fully benefit from all of the training
sessions over the last few weeks your
body will need more than just a good
days rest on Tuesday prior to the next
day’s games. Over the next five days
ensure you consider the following tips
to reach Wednesdays match in optimal
physical shape.
Tapering training sessions:
Prior to any big match or sporting
competition you want to be reducing
your volume of training. This is what
we call tapering your sessions. If you
haven’t been tapering your training
sessions already then start right away.
The idea of tapering is to allow your
body plenty of rest to recover from any
training prior to the big match but still
keep it at its optimal fitness levels. The
volume of the sessions should be low
but the quality high, focusing on the
speed of movements. Any heavy resist-
ance workouts or long aerobic sessions
should have been done and dusted a
couple of weeks ago.
If you have been training hard all
week I suggest you take the whole
weekend off and have a light training
session on Monday. Follow this with a
mobility session on Tuesday, and then
again on Wednesday morning prior to
your match (allow at least 4-5 hours
rest between this session and com-
mencing your warm-up). The idea of
these sessions is to keep the muscles
loose and the nervous system ready for
the physical activity ahead. An hour
session focusing on low intensity foot-
work and hand/eye coordination drills
followed by gentle mobility exercises is
perfect.
Rest and Recovery:
You want to be ensuring that you have
plenty of rest over the coming days to
recharge your batteries and help heal
any niggling injuries you may have. As
I have mentioned in a previous arti-
cle the optimal time for your body to
repair itself physically is from 1.00am
to 3.00am. To gain the most from this
window you need to be in a deep sleep
and to do this will take 2-3 hours.
Therefore aim to be in bed by 10.30pm
at the latest. I realise this may create
problems with your social lives for a
few days but you’ll be surprised with
how good you feel and how well rested
you are when you wake up!
Along with plenty of rest ensure that
you are drinking plenty of water. Re-
member a 1% drop in hydration lev-
els equals a 10% drop in performance!
Over the coming days really focus on
the amount of water you are consum-
ing. Aim for your body weight in kg
