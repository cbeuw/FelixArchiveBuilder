On Wednesday 27th February, London
is overtaken by the sounds of mutual
hatred between the Imperial Medicals
and Imperial College This
show down of colossal mag-
nitude will see 23 Imperial
College teams take on the
Imperial College Medics in
an array of sports from rugby
to water polo, culminating in
the JPR Williams Cup held at
Richmond Rugby Ground.
During the day, football, hockey,
lacrosse and rugby will be played
at Harlington Sports Ground, whilst
back at Ethos there will be
badminton, basketball, net-
ball, squash and water polo
matches. The day is rounded
off in the evening with the
Imperial Men’s 1st XV rug-
by playing against the Im-
perial Medicals 1st XV for
the JPR Williams Cup.
The event has grown every
year, with water polo being in-
troduced this year. Imperial have
dominated in the football and hockey,
with the medicals keeping a strong-
hold on the rugby and netball games.
The rest of the matches are definitely
up for grabs from either side, but that’s
not to say that there might be some up-
sets along the way.
For the last two years, the JPR Wil-
liams Cup, named after John Peter Rhys
Williams, a former Wales and British
Lions full back, as well as St. Mary’s
Old Boy, has been decided in the
last 15 minutes of the game, with the
medicals pulling away and ending up
the eventual winners. This year looks
like it will be another epic battle; with
Imperial having an outstanding season
and gaining promotion to the Premier-
ship, the Medicals have had
less luck, and have only just
begun to find their feet.
The main event promises
to be the greatest encoun-
ter yet. Will Imperial College
manage to turn the tide, or
will the Medicals walk away
victorious yet again? We’ll just
have to wait and see.
Tickets are still available to buy
on-line, however due to lack of viewing
areas in Ethos, no spectators
can attend. There are three
types of tickets available for
the outdoor events:

Pre-game hype: Bottle Match 2008
Versus The Big Clash: Varsity 2008
You’re going to need to pump iron just to watch this one. Varsity 2008 is coming: Wednesday 27th February
The Royal School of Mines is out for revenge after last year’s defeat to the Camborne School of Mines
Fierce competition for the ball in last years Bottle Match
Clash of the titans: a scrum from last year’s rugby Varsity match
The Bottle Match is an annual event
between the Royal School
of Mines (RSM) and the
Camborne School of
Mines (CSM). The
Bottle Match has been
taking place for 106
years making it the
second oldest varsity
match in Britain!
Students from the
rival schools go head
to head in rugby
(men’s and women’s),
hockey (men’s and women’s),
football, golf and squash.
The rugby match is the
clash which wins the much
coveted 3ft Bass-Char-
rington beer bottle stolen
in true RSM fashion by stu-
dents in 1946.
For a decade it had lived
behind The Union Bar,
however last year, Cam-
borne managed to win
it back. The game itself
was a dogged event,
with neither side really
pulling away from the other.
Camborne took the early lead through
a try and kept it to the end of the game.
RSM fought valiantly, but through all

their efforts, they could only manage
one converted penalty. In the dying
seconds of the match, RSM had the
chance with another penalty to
win the game and hold onto the
Bottle for another year.
However the wind blew
the ball just wide of the
posts and for the first
time in 10 years, Cam-
borne had won The
Bottle Match.
The determined
Miner’s travel down
to Camborne today
with the ultimate
goal being to bring
back the Bottle to its rightful
place behind The Union
Bar. Across the board, the
RSM sides are looking for
revenge over CSM.
In true RSM style, the
day is bound to be full of
drinking, banter and above
all, intense rivalry. Hope-
fully the 5 hour journey will
be worth it, and if not,
then everyone is sure
to have a great time.
Next week, Felix Sport
will have a complete
round- up of the days’ events,
and, hopefully, a picture of the victori-
ous RSM captain with the Bottle in his
hands.
