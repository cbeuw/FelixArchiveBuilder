Games Editors – Azfarul Islam and Sebastian Nordgren

Felicitations everyone! You’re probably
wondering why there was no Gaming
section last week and
for those of you who
missed their
fix: I apol-
ogise. I
was rather
busy then
and couldn’t make
time, so yeah.
Anyway, we’re back in full action
for this week with a gander at one of
the premier action games you’ll be
playing this year in the form of one
Devil May Cry 4.
The Devil May Cry series has long
been a herald for pure action in the 3rd
dimension, introducing all manner of
manouevres and tactics, some only en-
demic to 2D games of old. It set forth
simple colours to indicate health, mag-
ic and experience, placed the emphasis
on facing enemies that offered stiff re-
sistance and then gave your character
enough prowess to make them feel like
they were gods in their own rights.
Also, the gun-sword combination
comes across as ridiculously cool, al-
lowing shooter fans and close-quarters
brawlers alike to find a mode of play.
The boss fights in particular were sali-
ent in that they did the ‘boss’ moniker
proud. Excruciatingly difficult with
multiple encounters, these demons
made you pull off every trick in the
book to just survive. Winning was
quite a gratifying blessing. My favour-
ite boss in DMC to date stands as Nelo
Angelo. Being humanoid in size, he
seemed less impressive from the other
massive characters you fought. How-
ever, he makes up by being enigmatic,
having an actual backstory and being
capable of wiping your ass off his boots
within a matter of seconds. He was
harder, faster and yes, much stronger
than you despite being (spoiler warn-
ing... for a near-decade old spoiler...) a
former shadow of your twin brother.
‘twas rather brilliant indeed. Devil
May Cry 2, despite all the hype and
rather exciting trailers turned out to be
a less polished, far tamer affair: solid as
an action game, shoddy as a Devil May
Cry game. Fortunately, Devil May Cry
3 redeemed itself by being the verita-
ble Nelo Angelo: better than the first
in every way (sans the atmosphere,
methinks).
Besides our prime focus on Devil
May Cry 4, Sebb picks up his flam-
ethrower and sprays all the n00bs of
gaming with hot burning death. Alex
is back offering more musings on the
brilliant Ninja Gaiden (the other awe-
some action game) and Andrew Lyle
makes his debut for the Games section
by giving us his thoughts on the new
Halo, from an entirely different per-
spective, if you get my point.
Byte looks at two action-heavy
games: hack-and-slasher Achilles and
a brilliant Flash adaptation of Unreal
Tournament.
As always your input is always wel-
come at games.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
Good news: we may be setting up a
Steam community so stay tuned!

T
he most difficult thing
about taking a look at
Devil May Cry 4 is try-
ing to avoid any discourse
about the previous games.
Tell you what, I’ll save that for the edi-
torial you see on your left-hand-side
and immediately slash and Stinger my
way into the fourth iteration of the
game that redefined the action genre.
Unfortunately, DMC4 cannot lay
claim to such a lofty goal. That, it
can’t.
However, it knows the heritage that
courses through its veins leaving but
one option and that’s to get the party
started.
A rather innocuous intro-
duction scene regard-
ing the Order
of the
Sword
in the medieval
villa of Fortuna takes a
grisly turn as the hero
of Devil May Crys
past crashes
through
the ceiling
and tears
through the cultists with reckless
abandon. He even shoots the feeble old
head priest in the, well, head. Now, we
all know that Dante is an iconoclastic
badass but a villain he is not and this
shocking behaviour sets a basic tempo
for the story. Of course, all that is com-
pletely derailed when you realise that
after the deliciously choreographed
cutscene ends, you’ve assumed con-
trol of a similarly silver-coiffed warrior
named Nero.
Nero seems to be just as lackadaisi-
cal as our former-hero-turned-mur-
derer-or-is-he-really and the cheese he
spouts is worthy of the thickest Quat-
tro Formaggio pizza you can order. Ah,
it’s already invoked nostalgia. It seems
that Nero’s only impetus is a rather
pretty girl named Kyrie (despite all lin-
guistic logic, pronounced “Ki-ree-ey”)
and later on, when she is abducted,
Nero may find himself in an unlike-
ly alliance with Dante. Yeah,
totally unex-
pected.
Mmmhmm.
A proper
plot does not a
Devil May Cry
make and the
rather silly sto-
ry, despite the
early momentum
that drives pro-
gression, serves
only to put
in some dia-
logue in the otherwise gorgeous cut-
scenes. And by Sparda, are these brim-
ming with unfettered creative prowess
or what? Carrying on the insanity of
Devil May Cry 3, the move to the vis-
ual fidelity of High-Def only makes the
experience Sweet and it’s definitely got
Smokin’ Sick Style to match.
And this is where Devil May Cry
simply erupts into brilliance. It of-
fers a luxuriously mercurial, tractable
fighting system where you have every
opportunity to unleash your own eye
candy. Nero’s addition can only aug-
ment this and indeed, he does so with
spellbinding panache. His arcane Devil
Bringer offers a whole new variant of
organic combat that allows you to dic-
tate the range and keeps the orb coun-
ter constantly ticking.
In a single flourish, you may cleave
upwards with the Red Queen (see
Devil Arms) and then continue rising
as you slash at your foe without mercy.
Just as it falls happily to the ground to
writhe and die in peace, you snatch it
up with the Devil Bringer and con-
tinue your unique brand of pain
therapy. You can slam them into
the ground, whirl them till they’re
dizzy and hurl them into their on-
rushing allies. It’s rather glorious
and once again does what a DMC
does best: offer you a cogent feel-
ing of empowerment. And you will
remain creatively challenged as you
fight of hordes of daemons since the
game still retains the ever-rewarding
Style rankings that tick from an embar-
rassing D to a coveted SSS. Yup, ‘just
S’ still isn’t good enough: that’s how
DMC rolls. The only reason this works
so well is that the controls are pitched
with poise. They come across as rather
intrinsic; finely-tuned and tightly-re-
sponsive. This means that most, if not
all, failures to make the enemy submit
boil down to personal skills, co-ordina-
tion and creativity.
You’re able to exchange points in
order to buy a multitude of tiered at-
tacks that offer a smorgasbord of va-
riety. This means that you can truly
customise your character towards a
combat bias that you prefer. There is
no right combination here since all of-
fer interesting balances and it’s really
upto one’s own tastes and experimen-
tation desires. In a prescient move on
Capcom’s part, you’re able to refund all
previously bought skills and then re-
buy as you see fit anytime you want to.
The only disturbing thing about this is
that you no longer use the iconic Red
Orbs for upgrades; this crimson de-
mon blood is relegated to arcane items
only. Now, you need to attain Proud
Hearts that are only awarded after fac-

Ole! Dante is still as suave as ever
