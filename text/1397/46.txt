international phone line. Eureka!
At once, I called home to the safety
of my parents and siblings. My dad
picked up the phone, and I remember
suddenly being overcome with emo-
tion. In my juvenile efforts to find ad-
venture, I had got myself so wrapped
up in a completely avoidable situation
and now had to explain myself to my
parents who were as of yet unaware of
my escapades.
I remember thinking to myself then
the reason my parents were such
amazing people. Not only had they
made countless sacrifice for my edu-
cation and upbringing but when I did
silly things like this and got myself into
stupid situations, they were complete-

ly supportive until the problem was
solved, leaving their valuable advice
for later.
My dad, who is perhaps the most
volatile person in the family after me,
efficiently dispatched my brother to
the closest Western Union in Bir-
mingham with a few hundred pounds
to wire over while my sister and mum
both then had a small chat with me
to cheer me up. Literally tens of min-
utes before closing time $600 in crisp
notes were gracefully handed over to
me. I thought about why everything I
do must be such a close shave, with no
answer.
Come the next morning, Kennedy
took my lopsided rucksack and me to
as close to the port on motorbike as
possible and said goodbye. He was a
good man who was making tremen-
dous effort for his family. I could see
my parents having done the same for
me when I used to be a kid and I didn’t
blame him for whatever had happened.
I also said goodbye, vowing to come
back to climb Nyiragongo one day. He
said I should only come back when I
have a wife and children. Funny guy; it
was quite a sad parting.
Thinking away, I strolled to the port,
where I found people to be crowding
around rather densely. The crowd got
thicker and thicker as I pushed my way
close to the lake and as the elusive boat
finally came into sight, so did some-
thing unexpected, my final hurdle.
The boat was completely full from
top to bottom with people literally
hanging on to the edges, and the crowd
I had just pushed my way through were
other hopefuls like me looking to get
out of Goma. To prevent any further
entry from the unruly crowd, the port
had deployed armed men who were
pointing machine guns to the floor to
stop any unwanted incursion. Without
Kennedy, and not being able to speak
French or Swahili, I found myself in
this final pickle of a situation.
I had the bright idea of trying to cap-
ture this scene on camera and as I got
my D70s out, one guard’s eyes caught
mine and as he raised his gun and
shouted, it became pretty clear that
photography was not allowed.
I needed to be on that boat, but so
did all of the others around me. After
about a minute of analysis I had the
inspiration to use the single language
everyone understands – the dollar.
I thought about what a reasonable
amount would be and as a result pro-
duced with $15.
I pushed with all my might to the
front of the line and literally waved the
wad of notes at the gunmen and the
officials running the service. At this
late point it occurred to me what they
could have done to a powerless indi-
vidual like me to get a hold of the rest
of my cash and belongings, but over
years of travel I have realised that peo-
ple in foreign countries are not as bad
as movies will have you believe.
The green notes caught a few eyes
and instantly I was escorted past the
crowd and the gunmen to the entrance
overly problematic but Kennedy went
on to insist that I pay him for the Go-
rilla trip there and then, as the recent
instability meant the he needed the
cash for himself and his family.
This now became problematic be-
cause if I paid him I would be left with
no more then $7 in my pocket at such
a vulnerable time. It was probably the
most uncomfortable situation I have
ever been in.
At times of such crises I tend to solve
problems in the short term hoping for
longer term success so I essentially
shot myself in the foot and paid him.
He promised me that he would try and
help me get on that boat tomorrow, but
without money for the ticket and for
bribes, things looked a bit dubious.
So during the remaining day of pan-
ic, I went to the few banks Goma had
but my card would not be accepted an-
ywhere, nor could I access any funds.
The only option was a Western Un-
ion money transfer but most of these
were already closed for the day and as
time went on, I was starting to get very
worried.
As unlucky as I usually am, some-
times fate feels really sorry for me
and helps me out, and that afternoon
was one such exception. After losing
all hope and feeling severely stressed,
I was going back to my accommoda-
tion despondent, considering I could
no longer even afford that, when I saw
one final Western Union branch. I got a
feeling that this had to be it and thank-
fully, mercifully, it was. They were open
for another 35 minutes and also had an
of the boat where the one guy who
knew English dealt with me. “40 dol-
lars” he said. “25” said I. “Agreed” came
the reply.
It wasn’t too steep considering the
state of things. My bag was taken from
me and stowed away safely. I was led
to the VIP section and got to sit there
in shade while the boat chugged away
slowly from the lakeside.
I once again got my camera out to
capture the moment, getting one shot
of the burgeoning boat before every-
one in that photo shouted me down at
the top of their voice. There must be a
cultural reason for this I thought.
As I got to Bukavu five hours later, I
pondered over all that had happened. I
felt like the most insignificant visitor to
the Congo, yet one who was lucky and
unlucky enough to witness a propor-
tion of its problems first hand. I sup-
pose I came in looking for adventure
and I got it, but in the process fell in
love with the raw excitement offered by
this relatively lawless country. There is
vast potential to make a difference here
and I aim to return someday.
Upon getting to Bukavu, I boarded
the first taxi I saw and headed to Cy-
angugu in Rwanda. Just one final $10
bribe freed me as I came face to face
with the dense jungles of South Rwan-
da. Where now? I thought.
“The Congolese are stupid” Kennedy
had once said to me, “they can’t see that
they are themselves ripping their own
country apart”, and most of his friends I
met agreed. To understand the Demo-
cratic Republic of Congo, one obvious-
ly needs to live there and let it absorb
them. So far, I have just talked about
what happened to me but this is just
one half of my trip there. Next week I
will try and cover the other half, detail-
ing what Congo has to offer, my crude
attempts to learn some things and my
resulting limited understanding.
“the shock of
seeing the entire
city suddenly
swarming with
the presidential
guard and the
army when the
day before it had
been as dead as
a goat was quite
something!”
“and literally
waved the wad
of notes at the
gunmen and the
officials”
