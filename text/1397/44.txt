Finally the victor is crowned
Andrew Lyle reports from the front-line of Sony vs. Toshiba as the war ends
I
’m not entirely sure any of you
will remember the Betamax vs
VHS format war that took place
for almost a decade from 1975
- I certainly don’t, but looking
back on it, I found it quite interesting
to compare it with the past two years
of battling between HD-DVD and Blu-
Ray in which there now seems to be
a winner. Just in case anyone is won-
dering, VHS won the previous format
war, which is probably a good thing as
Betamax tapes were limited to only 60
minutes playback! Imagine a childhood
without movies...
Anyway, on first appearances, Beta-
max and Blu-Ray were rather similar
- both had more complex and costly
hardware, both had supposedly better
audio and video quality and both times
Sony refused to release the format to
the porn industry! This time how-
ever, Sony have increased the capacity
of their format to many times that of
HD-DVD and made the technology
more widespread, allowing many more
developers to build hardware to run
Blu-Ray discs and crucially, they also
put the drive into their latest games
console the PlayStation 3. This move,
whilst being extremely risky seems to
have paid off for them, as it helped
to put Blu-Ray drives in more homes
than the competitor. After all, peo-
ple are much more likely to purchase
a £300 games console which happens
to have a built in high-def drive than a
similarly priced stand-alone player - I
know I would.
Looking at HD-DVD and VHS, the
marketing and widespread availabil-
ity that eventually helped to win the
last war for the latter seemed to be
somewhat lacking in the former, with
a few companies releasing drives in
their PC’s, a number of manufactur-
ers building standalone boxes and of
course not forgetting Microsoft’s half-
hearted HD-DVD drive add-on for its
Xbox 360.
So now, after almost two years it
would seem that the next generation
video format has finally been decided.
Following Warner Bros. choice of the
Blu-Ray format earlier this year, other
companies have slowly been drifting
towards the same side with the final
nail in the coffin for HD-DVD being
the news from Wal-Mart, Best Buy
and Netflix that they would no longer
be stocking the format. As a result,
Toshiba announced earlier this week
that they would “no longer develop,
manufacture and market HD DVD
players and recorders”.
Now I must say that I actually feel
rather sorry for Toshiba - in the first
round they backed Betamax and lost;
in the second they seemingly tried to
walk the path of VHS by attempting to
flood the market with their cheap(er),
porn-friendly format... which also
lost. However, on the bright side upon
announcing that it was abandoning
HD-DVD, Toshiba’s stock rose con-
siderably; consumers now also have
a clear choice about which format to
purchase, but unfortunately with Sony
at the wheel, I am still left with the
dilemma of where to get my high-def
porn from? Well, if certain companies
have their way, in the future, all our
audio-visual needs will be sated by
downloads and legal ones at that - not
that I would ever endorse the illegal
acquisition of files, or porn for that
matter, as I’m sure one could find far
more exhilarating ways to achieve the
same result... but I digress. For now,
with trials of “super-fast” broadband
just beginning, I think it is safe to say
that your investment in Blu-Ray will be
a safe one and the only ‘proper’ way to
get high definition content onto your
brand spanking, shiny new HD telly.

Thousands will have to succumb to the charms of the Blu-ray Disc
(usually Mylar – the same material in
your earphones) sandwiched between
two grid electrodes (known as stators),
with an electric field of usually about
5kV and a low current going through
the diaphragm for modulation. The
most common ESLs these days are
usually around 1.5m tall and 0.3m
wide, with their deepness depending
on their attached subwoofer, if any.
The stretched diaphragm already
solves the weight problem with its
2-20µm thickness. Also, unlike the
coil drivers it has very delicate move-
ment that you can hardly notice by eye.
These two properties allow the pro-
duction of a very refined sound with
very little distortion, waltzed by a nat-
ural and comfortable bass. Specifically,
most should notice the bass part of the
piano, drum and guitar lasting a little
bit longer, rather than suddenly stop-
ping when coming out from normal
speakers, as if you are punched by it.
Also,sincethediaphragmisstretched
over a large flat surface area, the sound
waves produced have very little diffrac-
tion: imagine you are standing about 5
metres away from an ESL, listening to
some guitar performance in a room,
and now go right up to it with your ear
touching the ESL (don’t worry, it won’t
hurt), where you should hear almost
the same volume and quality as you did
5 metres away. This is definitely some-
thing that you don’t get from ordinary
speakers.
Another great feature is the lack of
a speaker cabinet – the average ESL is
just a 2-inch thick open panel, which
gives us a double-sided (or dipole)
sounding, meaning greater transpar-
ency, as well as no additional flavour.
All this adds up to high fidelity, as if
the live band is in the room, and you
can really feel the instruments being
blown or plucked right in front of you.
To go with the music, the ESL’s slim-
ness is also a bonus eye candy if done
properly.
Now you may ask: so if ESLs are so
great, how come it is not in the main-
stream market? The popular answer
would be because of the cost: a typi-
cal, mid-range ESL system would be
around $3000 these days, mainly due
to manufacturing difficulty, where the
diaphragm-stretching process and as-
sembly still have to be done by hand.
Most notably though is their large size
by nature, as the ESL panels require a
certain amount of surface area in order
to produce sound efficiently. This is
particularly important for bass, where
most ESLs fall short at, and therefore
they are often coupled with a subwoof-
er at the bottom, forming a hybrid ESL
system.
The second problem – and usually
the most commonly forgotten one –
is that the ESLs must be placed away
from the back wall – usually about 1
metre – to avoid severe interference
caused by the reflection from the wall
(remember, the ESL produces sound
on both sides!). More space is taken
up by the powerful amplifiers (at least
200W) in order to drive the ESLs, and
of course these cost money too, espe-
cially if they are vacuum tube amplifi-
ers, which are known to give a richer
sound compared to digital ones. Leav-
ing these behind, we finally have the
reliability problem: ESLs are still con-
sidered as unreliable due to the high
possibility of shorting when the air is
humid, although there are several ways
of preventing such event from happen-
ing such as implementation of coating
on the membrane and stators.
To sum up, ESLs really are superior,
with hardly any problems that most tra-
ditional loudspeakers have, provided
that you have plenty of room, money
and a fairly dry environment. If you are
looking for a system that can bring a
live concert into your room, where you
can both hear and feel the instruments
being played, this 53-year-old technol-
ogy is the way forward. Remember:
hearing is believing, so do check out
the ESLs when you have the chance!
