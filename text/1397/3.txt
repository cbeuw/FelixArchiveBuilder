Sabbatical Elections 2008
What are the main issues next year?
Snow in the Quad: Not one of the most pressing issues on the
incoming Sabbaticals’ minds, but the promise of a giant snow machine
in the archway of Beit would have been an awesome manifesto point
W
elcome to Felix’s
Sabbatical Elec-
tions 2008 special
feature. Over the
next ten pages we’ll
be bringing you manifestos from each
candidate as well interviews with the
Presidential candidates. Sabbatical
candidates were requested to submit
250-word long manifestos. In the in-
terests of fairness, each candidate has
been given the same amount of space,
hence the frightfully ugly blank spaces
at the end of some manifestos! For the
Presidential interviews, we’ve asked the
same questions to each candidate. Oc-
casionally we probed the candidates to
expand on their answers, hence some
transcripts have additional questions.
Later on in the feature you’ll find
shorter, 100-word long manifestos for
the Student Trustee and NUS Delegate
candidates along with a few short ex-
planations describing what they’re re-
quired for.
Voting is open online now at www.
imperialcollegeunion.org/vote, but be-
fore you head there, here’s a quick run
down of the main issues facing the stu-
dents hoping to sell their soul’s to the
Union:
The National Union of Students
(NUS):
Imperial College Union rejoined the
NUS last year but signs of change have
been barely noticeable. The NUS is
currently undergoing some crucial
reforms which – all going well – will
be in place from April after the 2008
Conference.
How deep these changes will run
remains to be seen though. Some be-
lieve that the reforms are merely pa-
per changes that will only affect those
deeply involved with their Union such
as Sabbatical and Club Officers, where-
as supporters feel that big enough
changes at the top will be seen by the
general student body on the ground.
Next year’s Sabbaticals will have to de-
cide the best ways of utilising a £44k
per year institution.
Union Masterplan Phase Two
The Masterplan is the Union’s rejuve-
nation project which has been running
for the last couple of years. Phase Two,
which includes the development of a
new Student Activities Centre and the
additions of a dance studio and refur-
bished gym, has been given the green
light. Next year’s Sabbs will have to
Voting open!: www.imperialcollegeunion.org/vote
What are the Sabbs for? Voting explained
Voting is open now. If you log on to
www.imperialcollegeunion.org/
vote you should see the page similar
to the picture above, albeit with a nice
login window to make sure you aren’t
rigging the election.
Operate the voting system using
your College username and pass-
word to log in. Select the election you
want to vote in, then you will have a
selection of the positions that are up
for grabs.
Tell them which candidate you pre-
fer, then repeat for each position
remembering to indicate an order of
preference to the other candidates (see
box for explanation on how the voting
system works.)
Enjoy your new Sabbatical, Student
Trustee, and NUS teams, and the
havoc that they will inevitably wreak
o’er the land. They’ve got me locked in
the basement ‘til elections are over and
oh god, I can hear them coming...
ensure it’s delivered smoothly, on time
and to spec.
Union Masterplan Phase Three
Phase Three is some way off yet, how-
ever the incoming Sabbs will probably
be involved in securing funds for the
development and they will certainly be
able to influence the design decisions.
2009 Higher Education Funding
Review
The government will be conducting a
review of Top-up Fees next year. The
current £3,000 cap could be increased
or even lifted entirely. Next year’s Sab-
baticals will have to represent the views
of the student body on a national scale
and be prepared to fight for what ICU’s
members want.
A new Rector and change in the
College regime
The current Imperial College Overlord
Sir Richard Sykes is stepping down in
the summer to make way for the new
Rector, Sir Roy Anderson. The Sabbat-
icals regularly work with College staff
and a change in College’s style would
definitely affect the day-to-day life and
running of the Union.
N
ot much! Ahahaha. Er,
let’s be serious people,
come on. The Sabbs
play a vital role in the
running of the Union
and you really ought to think carefully
before you decide on who to vote for.
If you pick someone solely on the ba-
sis of how good looking you think they
are, or whether you agree with their
attire or not, you’ve only got yourself
to blame when they’re successfully
elected and proceed to hike-up drink
prices by 20% to pay for their executive
leather chair and Cuban cigars.
Yes, the Sabbs are taking either a year
out from their studies or before they
head out into the real world, but it’s not
just simply a ‘year out’. Their decisions
really do affect the student body and in
the following several paragraphs we’ll
explain the functions of each role:
Union President
The big cheese. The King of the Dawg-
house. The MacDaddy. Essentially the
Union President oversees the entire
Union and all its students. He/she is
the boss of the three Deputy Presidents
and has a hand in permanent staffing
matters too.
The President has regular meetings
with College staff including the Rec-
tor so he/she needs to be able to argue
for the Union and hold his/her ground
around experienced people. At the
same time, the President needs to be
approachable and easy for students to
communicate with.
The character of the President sets
the character of the Union for the year,
so vote wisely.
Deputy President Clubs &
Societies
The DPCS is responsible for overseeing
all of the clubs and societies at Imperi-
al so if you’re a member of one, there’s
a good chance you’ll have to deal with
this person at some point.
He/she is responsible for organising
Freshers’ Fair at the start of the year
and with over 250 clubs at Imperial, it’s
an operation that requires meticulous
planning over the summer period.
Deputy President Finance &
Services
The DPFS is responsible for pretty
much every budget within the Union.
That means club, events and the bars’
budgets. If you’re club has to pay for
something expensive, this person has
the power to prevent you from doing
so. Similarly to the DPCS, this person
has to regularly deal with students, of-
ten clueless ones who don’t know how
the Union’s financing system works.
He/she needs patience and a mild spot
of OCD will help with signing claim
form after claim form.
Deputy President Education &
Welfare
The DPEW is the mother or father-fig-
ure of the student body. He/she is re-
sponsible for making sure students are
well looked after, have a home or halls
to live in, aren’t getting too stressed out
with work and are able to cope when
they run into financial troubles.
This person has to deal with students
on a one-to-one basis and definitely
needs to be approachable, but he/she
also has to attend a plethora of meet-
ings with various welfare related com-
mittees in College, so needs to be able
to argue a point well.
Felix Editor
1,000,000 points to the bright spark
who correctly guesses what this person
is for.
The Felix Editor is tasked with pro-
ducing 30 issues of Felix a year and the
Union Freshers’ Handbook. If they feel
up to the task, they can also help pub-
lish issues of I,Science and Phoenix.
The Editor is responsible for galva-
nising a team of voluntary students to
produce weekly content. How do you
play it? Demand content to be on the
dot and risk dispiriting your team and
losing late content, or play it more le-
niently but suffer the consequences of
all-nighter sessions editing the articles
that invariably come in just before the
very final deadline?
He/she is also responsible for the Fe-
lix website, the finances and also deliv-
ering the newspaper across campus.
Single Transferable Vote
ICU uses the Single Transfer-
able Voting system (STV). In
this system the voter assigns
each candidate a preference
number, with 1 being the most
favoured. Ideally, you number
each and every candidate.
If whoever you put a 1 beside
does not get enough votes
to be elected (or has already
aquired enough votes to be
elected in the case of multi-
ple posts), your vote goes to
the candidate that you put a
number 2 beside.
Thus if I hate A, love B, and
like C: I’d put a 1 next to B, a 2
next to C, a 3 next to RON, and
a 4 next to A to make sure the
bastard never gets in.
