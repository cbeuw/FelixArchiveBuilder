C
ollege will be going
through a period of great
change next year with
a new Rector, we need
a President with both
the experience and ability to work
with him in order to make sure these
changes are right for students. I have
experience and proven ability at every
level of the Union from club officer
to Union committees to Council and
then as Deputy President (Finance and
Services) last year.
With the College facing great chang-
es, the Union needs to move forward
too. We need officers prepared to lis-
ten to students and fight for their in-
terests, not pursue individual agenda.
I believe there are important things to
be done this year, including:
• An open review of our NUS mem-
bership culminating in a free and open
referendum.
• Negotiating a fair space agreement
with College including more poster
space for student activity.
• Getting discounts from local shops
and businesses with only an IC card.
• Improve our training and service to
all clubs and societies including cheap-
er prices for club bar nights.
• Working for funding for all FUs
to have a full time president over the
summer.
• Making the Union more open and
accessible with clearer communica-
tion; to serve our members, we must
first listen to them.
• Aiming for Cask Marque Accredi-
tation within the year.
You cannot elect a President on these
few short words but my full manifesto
is available at http://votejonmatthews.

Vote Jon Matthews for the change we
need and you deserve.
A
s RCSU President this
year and Welfare Officer
last year, I’ve got a strong
record of delivering for
students and a wealth of
experience. In all my roles in the Union
I’ve focused on deliverable outcomes
rather than bureaucratic processes,
and if you elect me as President I’ll
continue to do so. This is what I want
to achieve for you:
• Make the Union a place where you
want to drink, eat and dance. I won’t
raise drink prices.
• Deliver the Union refurbishment
on time and on budget, in an environ-
mentally friendly manner.
• Provide sexual health testing on
campus.
• Simplify online club finances and
give clubs more staff contact time.
• Reform the Union room booking
system.
• Keep you and your property safe.
Currently some main outer doors
can be forced open in halls and this is
unacceptable.
• Hold College to its promise to pro-
vide all first year students a place in
halls.
• Push reform of the NUS to make
it more effective and better value for
money.
• Make the voices of Imperial stu-
dents heard on the national stage dur-
ing the Education Funding review.
• Ensure the GSA has the support
it needs to deliver for postgraduate
students.
• Support Faculty Unions and the
RSM because they fill a vital social and
representative role.

group on Facebook and even if you
don’t vote for me first, please think

ence vote!
UNION
PRESIDENT
(Campaign supporter Alex Guite
spoke on behalf of Jennifer Mor-
gan due to family circumstances)
What will you get from the
NUS to make our membership
worthwhile?
That depends on whether the reforms
go through at the next NUS Confer-
ence. If they do, she’ll want to see
whether they’re just reforms on a piece
of paper or whether they’re actual in-
stitutional reforms. Then she’ll be able
to assess if it’s worth £44k. If they don’t,
I get the impression she’d be looking at
either a review or a referendum. She’s
certainly a sceptic.
Do you feel you’re truly represent-
ative in your views of the student
body, or do you think you’re too
closely associated with a clique?
A lot of Jen’s Union experience comes
through the RCSU, but she’s also been
involved in ICRadio and bowling. Plus
she’s still very much involved in and the
Biology and BioChemistry DepSocs.
I think she would say that, yes, she’s
been associated through the RCSU but
she’s proved by being a Faculty Union
President that she has a very wide ex-
perience of the whole Union.
What do you think of the Beit Mas-
terplan so far?
Sorry, I haven’t really spoken to Jen
enough on that one.
Can you make dB’s a credible ven-
ue and how?
It’s twofold: it’s about the redevelop-
ment and making sure students have
they’re say on what we get out of this
refurbishment. It’s not simply good
enough to look at the physical tfabric
of the building but also the entertain-
ment offerings.
Live! has described “an entrenched
attitude that certain things are op-
erational issues”, which prevents
elected officers getting things
done. How would you tackle this
to push through the changes you
want to make?
The thing she would rate most impor-
tantly is your management style and
how consensual you are and often I get
the impression [the term] “operation-
al” is used as a way of defending areas
within the Union. I think Jen would say
it’s about the way you approach people;
if you’re aggressive people are going to
be defensive and they’re going to put
up obstacles.
On what timescale can we expect
your promises to be delivered?
Some of [her manifesto points] are
clearly going to be works in progress
such as the Union redevelopment, but
some things she’ll definitely want de-
livered in her term are: a sexual health
testing clinic on campus; reforms of
the Union room booking system; a
resolution on security problems in
halls; and to make sure students’ views
are heard on a the national stage in the
2009 [Top-up Fees] review.
Where do you stand on the Higher
Education funding debate?
It’s all about keeping the cap and I think
she’d be in favour of variable funding
for different institutions so research
intensive places like Imperial get more
money.
Does she believe in free education
or just keeping the cap as it is?
I think she’d say free education is a nice
ideal but she’s realistic about the pros-
pects of that and how you achieve it.
What do you think about the Un-
ion’s current regulations govern-
ing the student media?
I think she would want to look again
at the regulations again and what I do
know is that she is a principle sup-
porter of a free press. During my time
as Broadsheet Editor she’s allowed me
to print whatever I wanted and I don’t
think the student media is going to get
much interference from Jen. It’s not
really what she’s interested in. I think
you’d certainly get a very sympathetic
ear from Jen.
Are you Ken or Boris?
She’s Ken, no doubt about it
Political Hack or Corporate Sell-
out?
I think um... I don’t think I can answer
that one.
What will you get from the
NUS to make our membership
worthwhile?
I personally have reservations with re-
gards to membership with the NUS.
We’re paying an astronomical amount
of money. One of my big manifesto
pledges is an open and clear review – as
soon as my term starts – of what we’re
getting from the NUS and then to ask
the question: is this worth it? Ultimate-
ly, this would lead to a referendum.
Do you feel you’re truly represent-
ative in your views of the student
body, or do you think you’re too
closely associated with a clique?
I’m not associated with any clique. I
live in halls; that gives me a very broad
spectra. I’m a member of ACC/RCC/
SCC/RSM clubs and a Guilds one too.
Past associations shouldn’t matter.
You listen twice as much as you speak
and provided you do that, that’s how
you represent people.
What do you think of the Beit Mas-
terplan so far?
It’s been fraught with difficulties right
from its inception. The first stage ran
way behind. People are saying the sec-
ond phase will be delivered on time but
College can’t deliver their projects on
time. Pretty much no one can in the
UK because you cannot – by law –
charge penalties.
The Masterplan has got to be flex-
ible. We can’t operate a plan set four
years ago and follow it religiously.
Can you make dB’s a credible ven-
ue and how?
dB’s is a difficult situation. The space is
badly organised. We cant change it in
Phase Two because the funding won’t
pay to renovate a commercial venue.
When dB’s is packed, it’s not a bad
venue. It looks horrible, but we turn
the lights out and it looks slightly less
horrible. To make it a good venue, it’s
a long term project and we don’t have
the time or the money.
Live! has described “an entrenched
attitude that certain things are op-
erational issues”, which prevents
elected officers getting things
done. How would you tackle this
to push through the changes you
want to make?
The two words I most hated to hear
when I was a Sabb last year were: “that’s
operational.” The first thing I’d do is
ban those words from being uttered.
Last year I didn’t always follow the
correct chain of command because [I
had to communicate with a long list of
people]. Instead I just sent an email to
the person that needed to do it.
The rules are needed for problems of
conduct, but for minor changes they
need a less rigid interpretation.
On what timescale can we expect
your promises to be delivered?
There are a lot of promises in my man-
ifesto. Some are quite quick, others
might take longer than a year. Change
takes time. There are points in there
that I want to start the change I’m not
going to be able to complete; but I’m
going to start everything. And that’s the
key: some things in there are changes
in culture and those take time.
Where do you stand on the Higher
Education funding debate?
I think my view on the debate itself can
be divorced from my personal views.
My personal view is that there should
be fewer university places funded to a
higher level. The government should
not be wasting money on pointless
courses such as golf-course studies.
I think the government made a pig’s
ear of the way they introduced the Top-
up Fees cap and now they can’t change
it. As soon as they do, every university
is just going to go up to the next level.
What do you think about the Un-
ion’s current regulations govern-
ing the student media?
I’ve had some concerns about them.
We need to look at how Felix is funded.
Ultimately as DPFS last year, if I hadn’t
signed a cheque, Felix wouldn’t have
been printed. That’s unacceptable.
Are you Ken or Boris?
Very definitely not Ken! I like Boris.
Political Hack or Corporate Sell-
out?
I can’t say I’m not a hack; that wouldn’t
go down particularly well!
