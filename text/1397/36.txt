Single
Column
The lovely people at IC Radio, limit-
less as they are in both eloquence
and generosity, have donated a
load of single reviews.
The Clocks
Old Valve Radio
★★★★✩
This is a genuinely awesome track. It’s
The Clocks’ first release since joining
Island Records in 2007, so the band
are not too well known yet, but if their
other songs are as good as ‘Old Valve
Radio’ then they certainly have some-
thing to offer to British music (and
their debut album is likely to be very
popular). The track is likely to get par-
ticular attention from student radio
stations because of the huge general
student obsession with the indie-pop
genre, which it fits into perfectly. It
has a great upbeat sound, lively vocals
with cheerful lyrics, a guitar solo and a
very memorable tune. These guys are
going to be big, and probably in time
to play at 2008’s music festivals. Check
out their website, clocksband.com, or
listen out for this track on IC Radio.

Cage The Elephant
In One Ear
★★★★✩
This first release, from Kentucky band
Cage the Elephant, evokes the essence
of traditional rock music; confident
and brash vocals snarl over a thud-
ding drum beat, fused with a groovy
bass line. The track explodes with an
aggressive and raw nature throughout,
with a fizzing lead guitar adequately
complimenting the vocals. The lyrics
will no doubt polarize listeners due to
their simple nature, but suit the style of
the track effectively.
The chorus proclaims that criti-
cism goes “In one ear, and right out
the other”. However, on the basis of
this impressive and catchy single, the
same cannot be said about Cage the
Elephant’s music.
Nat Roocroft
Vincent Vincent and the Villains
Pretty Girl
★★★✩✩
This track will make good light-heart-
ed listening if you like the Libertines,
who they bear a striking resemblance
to. The vocals are different, which
makes a refreshing change, but there
is little progression throughout the
song and the chorus is not especially
memorable.
Chris Birkett
Turncoat
Wasted On You
★★★✩✩
The Smiths, Pulp and The Beatles have
all influenced Turncoat’s records, they
say in their biography. Although there
are a few nice quirks, like the backing
vocals reiterating lyrics for obvious
emphasis, this does essentially mean
that we’ve heard a lot of very similar
bands before. It’s a good track though,
with interesting melodies and a good
beat.

Oh go on then, more singles for your (re)viewing pleasure
Mark Ronson
Just
★★★✩✩
Every day, free papers are pushed into
our hands and ideas into our minds.
How can you leave the house when
thousands of terrorists have plans for
your head? Luckily for you, XX Teens
are here to the rescue with their latest
track ‘How To Reduce The Chances
Of Being A Terror Victim’. With lyr-
ics taken straight from ‘The Complete
Terrorism Survival Guide’ this song
lists 26 ways to increase the likelihood
of making it to the end of the week in
one piece.
Urgent drums open the song and re-
peat as the clearly spoken instructions
flow with a regular rhythm. A few
crunchy guitar chords punctuate the

song and are joined halfway through
by electronic sounding cowbells.
The lyrics aren’t the band’s own crea-
tion and the casual tone of voice was no
doubt chosen to highlight the absurd-
ity of the statements, and to show that
by following the suggested plan you are
in fact assuming the role of a terror vic-
tim. The problem is that it just doesn’t
really work as a song. The message is
nothing new and the novelty of the
lyrics is all this song has to offer. I’m
sure they meant it to feel repetitive and
sterile to emphasise the point they are
trying to make, but it ends up sound-
ing dull after a few listens. It lacks the
energy and creativity of their earlier
singles, such as ‘B-54’ and ‘Darlin’. Let’s
hope that when they finally get round
to making their first album we see a
return to their more promising and ex-
citing song writing abilities.
James Houghton (Not ICRadio)
Not content with simply being a highly
sought-after producer, Mark Ronson
presents us his interpretation of the
classic Radiohead hit ‘Just’, having al-
ready tackled The Smiths, The Zu-
tons and Kaiser Chiefs on his double
platinum album ‘Version’. Vocals come
courtesyofAlexGreenwald(leadsinger
of Phantom Planet, who were respon-
sible for The OC theme tune). Whilst
this is an interesting spin on a classic,
its weaknesses lie in the song sounding
too much like the original, particularly
Greenwood’s vocals. The saxophones
on the song are great however. A satis-
factory, radio-friendly cover.

Vampire Weekend
A-Punk
✩✩✩✩✩
A Benny Hill riff dances cheekily across
the strings, punctuated by remedial
staccato drums, and a New-yorker’s
aching wail arches across each phrase.
Suddenly, rich flutes and ambient
organ-fuzz wash and soothe your ears,
thetom-tomsbuildandthesameyoung
man has cooed you into his bed.
This Midsummer Night’s Dream
crashes into a snatch of yelping ‘Hey
hey hey!’s, but before long the jerking
receeds and you’re back in the ethereal
faerie chorus, with cutesy lyrics ex-
hibiting all the band’s worldliness and
post-modern pop culture obsessions.
And you’re so damn chirpy that you’ve
bought their debut album.
Thomas Hampton (Not ICRadio)
As The Snow Fell ploughs out from the
sonic ice sheets of London-based art-
ist Iambic2
aka Guy Andrews, immers-
ing you in a cocoon of carefully crafted
synths and crackling samples that will
leave your eyes glistening.
It heralds the first release of the year
from netlabel Laridae which forms
part of the internet inspired explosion
of creative freedom, releasing and dis-
tributing all tracks for free in MP3 for-
mat to download via the web.
Breaking with ‘Storm’s Theme’ an
uneasy, bare-bones piano composi-
tion leads you in before searing strings
clear the ground for what is to come.
Andrews lists a host of influences on
his music, from ambient to jazz, and
it shows, pitched amongst the deso-
late post-rock landscapes reminiscent
of Explosions In the Sky, fragments of
Tortoise reside and Boards of Canada
samples simmer on the horizon.
Unfortunately at times the album
can be accused of melodramatics and
doesn’t always ring true, demonstrated
by titles such as ‘When Father Cries’ –
moments that are perhaps best suited
as a cue for Kleenex in ‘gritty’ ITV dra-
mas, where a gruff middle aged detec-
tive remembers how, as a rosy cheeked
little boy, his favourite teddy bear was
brutally ripped from his grasp by a
shady looking man.
Minor crimes aside, all can be forgiv-
en by the beauty of tracks such as ‘This
Day Goes Nowhere’, enveloping you in
the lazy chords of an icy beach, before
moving on through the Sigur Ros style
‘December’s Shadows’ and the shim-
mering glockenspiels of ‘Beside You’.
The twelve minute long ‘Sleep Cycle’
is Andrews’ testament to the ambient
genre trailing through the reverberat-
ing bowels of a synthesiser’s subcon-
scious, it’s a treat for those with a sweet
tooth for unadulterated sound. We’re
taken back to earth by the impulsive
‘Dust Below The Ground’, one of only
two tracks to feature Andrews’ vocals.
It is reminiscent of a warm campfire
version of Capitol K’s ‘Island Row’
album.
Concluding with the ambient tones
of ‘It Snowed When We Died’, you’ll be
left with a feeling of total bliss – sus-
pended above a luminescent glacier
protruding out from an overactive im-
agination. This album will leave you
with the tingling numbness of a pain-
killer induced coma (which is in no
way a bad thing).
If you are looking for a something
new amongst the ironically crammed
field of expansive soundscapes, you
won’t find it here, and taking from
such a range of influences leads to the
inevitable dilution of individual com-
ponents. But showing an undoubted
mastery of texture and avoiding the all
too frequent tunnel-vision of electron-
ic artists, we can hope to hear much
more from Iambic2
. Plus like all the
best things in life, ‘As The Snow Fell’ is
free, so go and download it!

Fresh for 2008: Iambic2
& The Pirates
If there is one thing the music scene
does not need right now, it’s another
generic indie five-piece. Unfortunately
for them, Pete and the Pirates fit the
mould right down to their quirkily
designed T-shirts. I brace myself for
half-an-hour of abrasive guitar twang-
ing, predictable melodies and same-
old lyrics about getting pissed up in
some obscure town just North of Saw-
bridgeworth, vocalised through half-
sung, half-shouted wails, a sound only
achievedwhenone’stootightjeanshave
restricted a healthy blood flow to the
diaphragm. Cautiously, I pressed play.
But, lo-fi and behold! (Sorry, I couldn’t
help myself). Far from the aurally of-
fensive noise expected from Pete and
his swashbuckling band of Pirates, one
is greeted with a warm pleasantness
comparable to an afternoon spent with
your mate and his Nan. To draw com-
parisons with something less obscure,
the Pirates have a dreamy quality about
them reminiscent of The Shins and TV
on the Radio-esque quirky but well de-
veloped harmonies.
A quick look at their myspace con-
firms they are probably Nice Chaps,
with a penchant for facial hair and nor-
mal jeans. So far so… okay. Pioneering
on through the album is done with rel-
ative ease; every song presents itself as
a simple three minute, lo-fi and catchy
indie-pop package received with head
nodding gratification. The climax of
the album definitely comes at the end
with the faster paced, probably-will-
be-dancing-to-at-Metro-next-week
‘Bright Lights’, which leaves a nice taste
in your, urm, ears and dare I say it, a
thirst for more. Not a ‘been lost out at
sea for a week’ thirst mind, but more of
a, ‘small jog to the bus stop’ dryness.
Overall, Little Deaths offers its lis-
tener a pleasant ramble through fairly
conventional indie-pop with some
kooky Pirate-isms along the way. Not
life-changing by any means, but who
says that is the aim? Let’s be nice and
hope they don’t just become another
drop in the ever tumultuous ocean that
is the indie music scene.
