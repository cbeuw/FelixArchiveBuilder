Achilles

For those of you who found
God of War’s epic plot and ad-
venturing aspects something
of a fly in your soup of action,
then Achilles is your answer.
Mainly because it’s free. And
fun. Mostly fun.
The basic premise is to
traverse levels of increasing
degrees of difficulty all the
while mauling your enemies in
various ways. It may be some-
what brainless but there’s this
sickeningly visceral thrill of jab-
bing a spear into someone’s
face at point blank range.
The challenges get tougher,
relying on you to find a bal-
ance between blocking and at-
tacking. Despite being a simple
Flash game, there appears to
be a few shades of depth to the
combat as you are able to pick
up spears and choose between
hurling them like javelins or us-
ing them to skewer objects.
Without a spear you always
have access to a short sword
and the trusty soles of your
boots for those “This is Spar-
ta!” moments that this game
undoubtedly tries to recreate.
The bosses are fun and the
gameplay in general has you
pushing constantly forward.

Right, so I’m hardly the great-
est UT fan out there, but there’s
no denying that this 2D can be
surprisingly addicting.
Employing the same airy
physics and destructive weap-
onry of its full-time brethren,
the Flash iteration of the game
does its forebears proud. The
game is still relatively crazy, if
not as fast paced.
The controls are even the
same (in a certain way): aim
with the mouse, use WASD to
move (and jump) and use the
number keys to select weap-
ons. The game presents plenty
of options for your preferred
play types so expect to get fur-
ther distracted in lectures.

T
he next generation is
growing up to be wusses
– physically and mentally.
From birth, children are
placed in padded cribs
and live their whole life above the safe-
ty net of a Health & Safety obsessed
society. In an age when everyone's life
expectancy is higher than ever, we're
all sicker than before – with allergies,
diabetes, obesity and a slew of mental
illnesses being the norm rather than
the exception. And with political cor-
rectness the buzzword of the day, even
our opinions are placed in a safe little
space where no opinion is mocked; no
matter how absurd. In short, life lacks
a fail state. While some of you may be-
lieve that this type of opinion shouldn't
be found in the Games section, you're
wrong. For lo and behold, the point:
games are too damned easy.
Remember playing a Japanese shoot-
'em-up at the arcade, and dying on
the first level every single time? Re-
member playing Doom on Nightmare
and trying to kill an imp with your
fists? Remember dying in EverQuest
and having to do a corpse run while
stripped of all your gear? Hell, remem-
ber playing Mario and trying to make
that one jump over a flaming pit of lava
that required perfect timing? Odds are
high that you don't. These days if your
health doesn't regenerate automagical-
ly, you'll resurrect mere seconds from
where you died with no penalty at all.
And slowly, skill is no longer required
as the formerly inevitable fail state of a
brutal death is removed.
Personally, I blame Halo – its regen-
erating health and shield was the first
step towards games becoming easy.
Since then, we've all grown accus-
tomed to being treated as incompetent,
and there's a string of games to prove
it. StarCraft set the bar for difficulty
in strategy games, with multiplayer
games that could last under 5 minutes
if you weren't prepared – now we have
Supreme Commander, where games
only end when a player manages to
build nukes at Tech Level 172, 3 hours
into the game. EverQuest's corpse runs
against World of Warcraft's ghostly
corpse stroll; Doom's cyberdemons
against BioShock's Big Daddies (with
a resurrection chamber 10 ft away, of
course); and the titular villain from
Diablo II against Oblivion's... er... really
camp 60's guy?
Gimmicky games like Guitar Hero
or anything made for the Wii just go
further to prove that, collectively,
we are starting to suck at games; and
worse yet, we're quite happy about it.
Wii Sports can be played undefeat-
ably by waving your hands back and
forth like a hyperactive toddler – try
doing that in a game of Quake 3 and
then come back and tell me I'm wrong.
Games used to be about the challenge
– about pushing yourself to beat one
more level, get one more item and be
the best you can be. The games that
are described as difficult today – Ninja
Gaiden, N, Ikaruga – used to be par for
the course. Whatever happened to the
Flamebait: Gaming wusses
Sebastian Nordgren thinks y’all should toughen up and play like men, ya pansies
thrill of failure?
And despite all this, despite being
treated like we're not up for a chal-
lenge, more people call themselves
gamers than ever before. This wouldn't
bother me if it weren't for the fact that
I do remember beating Super Mario in
one sitting; killing that cyberdemon in
Doom that had killed me a dozen times
before; and getting past that last guard
in Thief.
And you know what? It felt damned
good – better than any feeling I've got
from any singleplayer game in many,
many years. All that frustration and
pent-up rage from failing over and
over again made the pay-off all the
sweeter. So I ask you: is there no place
for a challenge anymore?

Hey, the fight ain’t over yet
E
ver since the 'end' of the
Halo story signaled by Halo
3, speculation has been high
as to whether another game
would be made. In Halo
Wars, we seem to have our answer,
though this time it leaves the tried
and tested FPS genre, moving instead
to become a real time strategy game.
Ironically though, whilst the original
games were made for both console
and PC, it seems that this incarnation
will be solely for the 360, with the con-
trol system being "one of the things
Ensemble spent the most amount of
time on". (Apparently the only controls
required are the analog stick and the
face buttons.) Any rumors that a PC
version may have been appearing were
further trounced by a statement from
Microsoft to IGN earlier this month
saying "Halo Wars is being devel-
oped from the bottom up for the Xbox
360 and its control scheme to ensure
that we deliver a groundbreaking con-
sole RTS experience. Given that, we
have no plans to develop 'Halo Wars'
for Windows Vista at this time." ...
perhaps they decided that in a PC vs
360 multi-player match, the PC gamer
may have a rather substantial advan-
tage, but given the nature of the RTS
genre, it still seems a rather strange
decision...
Anyway, back to the game itself. In
Halo Wars, the player takes control
of the UNSC (United Nations Space
Command) forces in their first encoun-
ter with the Covenant after the loss of
the first planet, Harvest to the afore-
mentioned alien bad guys. Whilst no
clear details have yet emerged (the
game's release date being touted as
June 27th by Amazon and Play.com)
I would assume that the game would
follow a similar formula to the suc-
cessful Command and Conquer fran-
chise, giving the player a solid single
player campaign with UNSC taking
the role of GDI, the Covenant as Nod,
and perhaps even a possible role of
the Flood as Scrin. However, since the
game is supposed to tak place before
the events of Halo: Combat Evolved,
the UNSC wouldn't actually know
about the Flood, which would throw
that theory out of whack, yet there is
nothing to say that the Covenant had
not already encountered the Flood –
and they would make an rather inter-
esting addition to a multiplayer side
of the game. In terms of units, the
old favourites such as Warthogs, Ban-
shees and Scorpions will all be present
along with a few new additions such
as the Hawk Helicopter and Wolver-
ine Rocket Tank. Having watched the
demos and trailers, I would surmise
that standard defense structures would
also be available, along with a plethora
of air craft and infantry types rang-
ing from the standard UNSC troops
to the commando style Master Chief in
full Mjolnir armour – though whether
he would be able to take out an entire
armada as per normal is subject to de-
bate. All in all, it looks to be shaping
up as a rather fantastic game and an-
other reason perhaps to purchase a 360
over a PS3, but this is, after all, only a
preview and I'm sure once we get hold
of a copy we'll be able to bring you a
full on review detailing the ins and
outs of this sexy looking game.
