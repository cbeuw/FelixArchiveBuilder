Union bar and food item prices may
rise by 10p, and concerns were raised
by ICU Deputy President Finance &
Services, Chris Larvin, over the in-
crease in costs due to the Union’s En-
vironmental policy.
Compliance with the Union’s green
policy has led the bars to replace their
disposable plastic skiffs with re-usable
and washable plastic glasses, and that
food be served with either washable
crockery and metal cutlery, or bio-
degradable knives, forks, spoons and
containers that are made from potato
starch.
According to the DPFS, the washable
plastic skiffs have cost the Union bars
in South Kensington an extra £2500
over the past six months, and are ex-
pected to cost the same over the next
six months. They have also led to lo-
gistical issues because of difficulties in
finding sufficient storage space (which
do not stack as compactly as the pre-
vious disposable skiffs), and washing
them fast enough to cope with demand
in the Union’s only dishwasher.
The biodegradable, disposable forks
and containers are calculated to cost
the Union catering approximately £35
more per week than the plastic versions
(knives and spoons cost the same). The
cost of forks has increased from 0.525p
for the white plastic, and 1.4p for the
black plastic versions, to 3.875p for the
potato starch eco-friendly version. The
new biodegradeable takeaway contain-
ers cost 8p each, 2.5p more than the
polystyrene boxes.
The DPFS, Chris Larvin, said that the
union was “currently having to review
prices across bars and catering as a re-
sult of the increased costs. This high-
lights the impact that the policy deci-
sions made by Council have very real
impacts on the activities of the Union.”
“This has been the result of a very
vocal minority harassing the Union all
year (the Trading Forum is a prime ex-
ample which has been hijacked by eSoc
[Environmental Society],” he added,
“Students need to make their views
known to Council.... i.e Turn up....”
The lead writer of the Environmental
Policy and eSoc Head Gardener, Adele
Peel, responded:
“This time last year, 1331 students
signed a petition calling on the Un-
ion to adopt an environmental policy.
Within a month, Union Council passed
a policy incorporating all the ideas
from the petition.
Some of these claims about the poli-
cy are astonishingly blinkered.”
“Contrary to these claims, the En-
vironmental Policy doesn’t require
the Union to buy excessive numbers
of reusable skiffs. It looks like there’s
an implementation problem if they’re
spending more on skiffs than they did
before.
The Union has chosen to spend more
on bio-degradable cutlery than neces-
sary since suppliers suggested by pro-
ponents of the policy were over 50%
cheaper than those in use.
ChrisLarvinsaysthatit’sonlya“vocal
minority” who are interested in green-
ing the Union. Yet the 1331 students
who signed the petition last year, more
than double the number who voted for
Chris Larvin, clearly disagree.
Whilst I’m not denying that some
areas of the policy may increase costs,
there’s also opportunity for savings to
be made.”
