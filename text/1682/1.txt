An analysis of
Imperial's investments
reveals significant
holdings in tobacco,
arms, oil and gas, and
pharmaceuticals.

A
n analysis of
Imperial Col-
lege London’s
e n d o w m e n t
fund has revealed
significant direct and
indirect investments in
the tobacco, fossil fuel,
weapons, and pharma-
ceutical industries.
As of September 2017,
the College was investing
£3.5 million in the tobacco
industry, nearly £9 million
in the fossil fuel industry,
£3.1 million in the arms
industry, and over £16
million in pharmaceuti-
cals, out of a total fund of
over £266 million.
These investments
include those where the
College has directly in-
vested within a company
– for example, their
£496,000 investment in
Exxon Mobil – and those
where they have placed
money in an investment
portfolio containing
said companies. These
holdings make up almost
half of all the money the
College has invested.
In response, Rhidian
Thomas, Imperial College
Union’s Ethics and
Environment Officer,
told Felix: “I’d like to
congratulate Imperial on
succeeding in bringing
together a comprehensive
selection of some of the
most ethically dubious
companies around, all
in one portfolio. It’s
staggering that anyone in
College thinks it appro-
priate for a university – a
charity even – to give so
much money to the arms
and extraction industries.
Even College’s commit-
ment to avoid investing in
tobacco seems paper-thin,
now that it’s clear that it
has millions invested in it
through third-party funds;
so much for “smoke-free
Imperial”.
Tobacco
Imperial has around
£3.5 million invested
indirectly in the tobacco
industry, through invest-
ment funds. Their invest-
ments include some of the
major worldwide brands:
through their largest two
contributions to invest-
ment funds, Imperial have
over £650,000 invested in
Philip Morris, the maker
of Marlboro cigarettes,
which previously threat-
ened to sue the UK gov-
ernment for “billions of
pounds” of compensation
if plain packaging was
introduced.
Imperial also has
£400,000 in Imperial
Brands,andover£370,000
in Reynolds American,
a subsidiary of British
American Tobacco – the
largest publicly traded
tobacco company in the
world.
The investments seem
at odds with Imperial’s
medical research, par-
ticularly that into cancer
prevention and treatment.
Smoking is linked to
at least a dozen forms
of cancer, and tobacco
smoke contains more than
50 chemicals that can
cause cancer. Smoking
also has a number of
other effects on health,
particularly on the cardi-
ovascular and respiratory
systems, increasing the
risk of strokes, heart
attacks, and lung disease.
Smoking is estimated to
cause 6 million deaths
each year, with 600,000 of
those down to secondhand
smoke inhalation.
