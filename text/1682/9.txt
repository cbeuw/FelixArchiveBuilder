Salieri versus God : Amadeus at the National Theatre
W
hy do good
t h i n g s
h a p p e n
to terrible
people? Who among
us has not balked at the
happiness and success
of someone we consider
to be objectively odious,
absolutely awful? In the
late Peter Shaffer’s classic
1979 play, the virtuoso
composer Mozart’s very
name – ‘Amadeus’,
“beloved by God” – is
an affront to the Viennese
court composer Antonio
Salieri. Whilst Salieri
is assiduously virtuous,
having bargained with
God to be so in exchange
for musical fame, Mozart
is his opposite: selfish,
infantile, and rude. Yet it
is Mozart who is able to
compose with seemingly
divine inspiration, setting
down fully formed mas-
terpieces on paper with
effortless ease even as
he cheats and curses and
makes a general nuisance
of himself. In contrast,
Salieri’s compositions,
though celebrated at
Court, are pedestrian. He,
by his own admission is
cursed only to be “a pair
of ears” – alone able to
recognise true greatness
in Mozart but never able
match it. This he considers
a personal betrayal by the
Divine Creator, and thus
pits himself against his
God, vowing to silence
Mozart as vengeance.
The play begins as,
crippled with guilt in
his dying hours, Salieri
conjuresuptheaudienceas
the “ghosts of the future”,
and confesses his sins,
demanding absolution for
his plots against Mozart.
The years roll back as
Lucian Msamati’s Salieri
rises slowly from his
wheelchair and guides us
through the backstabbing
politics of 18th
century
Vienna. Msamati gives an
arresting performance – at
times he addresses the
audience directly, else-
where offering commen-
tary of his inner thoughts
as his castmates stand in
tableau around him or the
orchestra, replete with 20
members of the Southbank
Sinfonia, strike up. He is
a commanding presence
on stage, his voice thun-
dering in rebuke to God,
able to make the audience
hang on the edge of their
seats with a sharp remark.
His Salieri cuts a tragic
figure, a dignified man
brought low – though not
in material success – by
caustic jealousy. Adam
Gillen’s Mozart offers
a stark counterpoint:
crass and insufferable,
in the first act the young
Wolfgang is irritatingly
puerile, and Salieri’s sim-
mering resentment seems
entirely logical. Yet as the
play progresses, Gillen is
able to suffuse his char-
acterisation with pathos;
his Mozart matures and is
tempered by the misfor-
tunes that come his way.
It is not always a nuanced
performance – far from
it – but is an ultimately
affectionate portrayal of
a not altogether likeable
character.
Adelle Leonce, as
Mozart’s wife, Constanze
Weber, is at once defiant
and vulnerable, whilst
Matthew Spencer brings
plenty of comic relief
to his role as Joseph II,
the Hapsburg Emperor.
Alexandra Mathie, Hugh
Sachs, and Christopher
Godwin all give fantastic
performances as two
imperious barons of the
Court, and the Director of
the Opera respectively.
In a production that
hardly ever puts a foot
wrong, one of the unde-
niable stars is Matthew
Longhurst’s direction.
Shaffer’s script demands
a theatrical spectacle,
and Longhurst delivers.
Remarkably, Longhurst
opts to make the orchestra
an integral part of the
on-stage performance; it
is a bold choice but one
that feels necessary. After
all, this is a play to which
music is inextricably
linked. The violinists,
flautists and bassoonists
of the Sinfonia, together
with six singers, are not
resigned to the orchestra
pit, but move around
the stage, reacting to the
actors around them. When
Salieri describes his
childhood deal with God,
the orchestra raise their
hands in silent prayer,
but they are not simply
a reflection of Salieri’s
thoughts – when he asks
them to play an excerpt
from his sub-par opera
The Stolen Bucket the
orchestra decline, to great
comedic effect.
The inclusion of the or-
chestra in this startlingly
inventive manner, paired
with the brilliant lighting,
designed by Jon Clark,
creates a sumptuously
cinematic experience. In
one tremendous scene
towards the end of the first
act we watch as Salieri,
upon opening a folio of
Mozart’s finest composi-
tions, is overcome. Slight
modulations of lighting
pitch us from reality to the
depths of Salieri’s tortured
mind. At first there is a
slow, urgent thrum of the
bassoons and trumpet, and
the vestiges of the com-
poser’s comfortable front
room are dragged off into
the wings, Salieri is alone
on an empty stage with
nothing but the music, as
the assembled orchestra,
standing on a an elevated
stage, play Mass in C
Minor. Then slowly the
clarinet and violins join
in on the higher notes, and
as the majesty of music
dawns on Salieri, an
imagined Mozart joins the
orchestra to conduct them
in a frenzy of movement,
and Fleur de Bray’s
crystal clear soprano rises
above the instruments in a
haunting Kyrie. Little by
little, the stage on which
the music is being played
advances towards Salieri,
and great beams of light,
growing ever brighter,
shine out towards the
audience, casting the
orchestra in silhouette.
Eventually, with a great
crash of percussion,
Salieri, in both awe and
despair, sinks to his knees.
We in the audience cannot
help but be moved.
This revival is nothing
short of an epic undertak-
ing. It may be the story
of the self-proclaimed
patron saint of mediocrity
but Shaffer’s brilliance
is plain to see. Shaffer is
considered one of the best
British playwrights of the
20th
century. There is no
stronger evidence for this
than Amadeus.
Lucian Msamati gives a powerful performance in a fantastic revival of Peter Shaffer’s classic play about envy.

AMADEUS
Rita, Sue and Bob Too – an exploration of power, class,
and women’s voices
Andrea Dunbar’s masterpiece has come to the Royal Court at the right time. Despite being written in the 1980s, it
has a worrying number of echoes in the #MeToo era.
I
t was the play that
nearly didn’t happen.
After the Royal
Court’s founder
Max Stafford-Clark
was accused of sexual
misconduct, a decision
was made to cancel the
upcoming production of
Andrea Dunbar’s 1982
play Rita, Sue and Bob
Too, which centres around
the relationship between
a married man and two
15-year olds in Bradford.
The theatre said that put-
ting on the play would be
“highly conflictual” given
the current climate, which
is revealing the grubby
undercarriage lurking
beneath the shiny facade
of the arts industry. After
intense pressure, however,
they reversed the decision.
It was the right move.
Dunbar was a singular
voice in the world of
British theatre before her
untimely death at 29, and
Rita, Sue and Bob Too
reminds us of this – the
actors all seem to relish
her verbatim-esque
dialogue, which manages
to be humorous and
heart-breaking in equal
“The actors
all seem to
relish Dunbar’s
dialogue,
humorous and
heart-breaking
in equal parts”
caught up in the plot –
they perfectly embody
the cruelty that such an
age group can engender,
as well as the gaping in-
securities that are the root
cause. Dobson’s Sue pos-
sesses a disarming sense
of confidence, but has to
face an abusive father at
home, while Atwal’s Rita
is the more conflicted of
the two regarding their
situation. Atwal manages
to brilliantly convey the
yearning for belonging
so common at that age –
sending out vague smoke
signals of her underlying
emotions as a means of
testing the water, lest she
find herself exposed.
Between them there’s
Bob, played by James
Atherton: a young man
trapped within a marriage
he dislikes, he knows how
much (or little) attention
he needs to pay to Rita and
Sue to get them involved.
Within the cramped car in
which his character has
sex with Sue and Rita,
Atherton is able to bring a
sense of physical comedy
to the role, providing the
audience with plenty of
conflicting emotions as
we begin to sympathise
with him.
Before the house lights
went down, the woman
behind me mentioned the
film version of Rita, Sue
and Bob Too. Directed
by Alan Clarke in 1987,
the film was described
by my neighbour as “a
bit of a light romp”.
The version we watch is
anything but. Director
Kate Wasserberg is well
aware of the conflicts
and tension at the heart
of Dunbar’s text. This
becomes most apparent
near the beginning of the
play: as Bob takes Rita
and Sue back home, he
begins to ask increasingly
inappropriate questions,
before eventually having
sex with each of them in
turn. Atherton, Dobson,
and Atwal all make use of
the four small chairs that
serve as the set, contorting
themselves against each
other as Bob’s buttocks
jerk up and down. It’s a
funny scene, in the way
we instinctively laugh at
wibbling bottoms. But
then the house light slowly
come up, and the scene
drags on for an uncom-
fortably long length of
time. Go on, Wasserberg
seems to be saying, look,
and laugh if you can.
What seems shocking
and daring about
Dunbar’s play is not so
much the sexual aspect
– indeed, it was based
partly off her own expe-
riences, and the current
wave of accusations of
misconduct show us that
men taking advantage of
women in lesser positions
of power has never gone
away – but rather the way
she centres the working
class voice, specifically
those of women. Besides
Sue and Rita we’ve got
Bob’s long-suffering
wife Michelle (Samantha
Robinson), and Sue’s
mother (Sally Bankes),
as well as Rita’s single
mother – mentioned but
never glimpsed. Through
this cast of characters,
Dunbar is able to portray
the chilling nature of a
life of gradually receding
opportunities: for Rita
and Sue, the most impor-
tant thing is to not get
pregnant. As Sue’s mother
hauntingly “I was 23
years old when I had my
first. I felt trapped. When
you’ve had a baby it’s not
a thing you can put to one
side and say ‘I’m going
to the pub tonight’. That
freedom is gone”.
The Royal Court’s
Rita, Sue and Bob Too
is not an enemy of the
#MeToo movement. Far
from it. It might be one of
the cultural artefacts that
proves the best response
to the current climate.
Through raising up the
voices of disadvantaged
women, exploring the
invisible traps that keep
them engaged within a
cycle of tragedy, Rita, Sue
and Bob Too provides us
with a generous, difficult,
complex, brilliant ex-
ploration of power in its
many forms.
