Grumpy Bastard hates new Black Mirror
Is there anything bleaker than Charlie Brooker’s vision of humanity’s future? Yes. Grumpy
Bastard’s reaction to the whole thing.

I
watched the fourth
series of Black Mirror
very recently. For our
American and men-
tally impaired readers,
note the use of the word
series and not season,
as I am referring to a
television programme and
not a time of year, or an
attempt to make food taste
edible. Americanisms are
a very frustrating part of
life, but with government
shutdowns galore there is
an ever increasing chance
of a civil war, so hopeful-
ly we can take back the
colonies and kick some
sense into them.
I did not enjoy the latest
series of Black Mirror.
I had high hopes for this
viewing experience as
the previous episodes
were very strong and also
involved some prophetic
elements. For those of
you unaware please see
David Cameron fucks a
pig and angry gummy
bear is a little less con-
troversial than Trump.
Having watched it, and
read the mediocre reviews
in this excuse of a paper
I decided to do my own.
In the comment section.
Because fuck you.
The first episode was
every neckbeard’s wet
dream, trapping those that
bully you in the outside
world into some kind of
hellish nightmare and
tormenting them in per-
petuity. The main reason
I hated this episode was
that it ended in a morally
satisfying way, when
in reality, that creepy
engineer bloke would be
committing every sex
related crime that he could
think of. By setting the
whole thing as a “tasteful”
universe, the writers
deftly avoided the ethical
issues surrounding nudity
in VR and the terrifying
position of possessing 3D
nudes of someone from a
DNA swab.
a device that allows an
insurance saleswoman to
view people’s memories
to settle claims. That and
a murderous psycopath
that decides that killing
everyone is the best way
to minimise the disruption
to her life as a successful
architect. Quite frankly
I see no problem with
murdering people that
work in insurance as it’s
almost a mercy killing,
but in the end, the killer is
found out by an inconven-
iently placed hamster. The
problem is that hamsters
have terrible eyesight
and are mostly driven
by a need to shag and/or
murder any sexual com-
petition before dying of a
heart attack due to over-
excitement or a surfeit of
South Americans.
The fourth episode was
Hang the DJ. Like the first
episode, it was based in a
weird virtual reality run
from your phone to try and
find the perfect mate. The
thing was that they were
in the same bar to start
with. I pity anyone using
this program in Metric.
The fifth episode was
called Metalhead, for
some reason. I’m fairly
certain that the dog robots
were based off the Boston
Dynamics creation that
looks similar, but is
mostly abused by humans
as opposed to hunting
them down and shanking
them. I feel that the
concept of dangerous AI
has been hugely overex-
plored in many different
genres. Black Mirror
would probably be doing
itself a favour if it looked
real life semi-autonomous
weapons in the face and
shat itself. I also failed
to understand why it was
shot in black and white.
Many critics called this
“bold,” but I’m afraid that
colour TV was invented
for a reason: because it’s
better.
The sixth episode is the
worst of the batch. Black
Museum is a pathetic
attempt to canonise the
whole of Black Mirror
and place it all within one
universe. I don’t think
I’m alone when I say this
is a terrible idea. Black
Mirror all taking place in
the same universe only
serves to place limits on
what it can explore next.
There are some truly
groundbreaking technol-
ogies that will change the
way society works, and
if this programme does
not do them justice then
another media form will
have to. It’ll probably be
a book, which means no
one’ll ever read about it
and we’ll stumble blindly
into a dark future domi-
nated by Jeff Bezos, Mark
Zuckerberg and Elon
Musk, all fighting to see
who can control the most
souls to power their life
support machines.
Warning: Spoilers
behind.
Because also fuck you.

“Murdering
people that
work in
insurance is
essentially
mercy killing”
The second episode
was a little better. The
concept of using a far
fetched technology to be
a far more controlling
parent was interesting, but
clearly the writers had
never heard of the Turpin
family. Who needs a high
tech brain implant when
you can just chain all your
kids in a basement. So
much cheaper.
The third episode was
quite frankly ridiculous.
Essentially it is driven by

The rise of an unlikely figure in the defence
of free speech
As Jordan Peterson arrives to the UK to promote his new book, Alan Perfect offers his take on
what this pop-star intellectual has to offer.

T
here is absolutely
no doubt that free
speech at univer-
sities in the UK
and the US has hit a low
point. There is an obses-
sion with keeping students
in their safe spaces in
order to be protected from
any kind of ideas which
they might find offensive.
This strategy makes sense.
It is, after all, the easy
path to take. UC Berkeley
took the hard path and had
to spend about 600,000$
on security for an event
in which conservative
speaker Ben Shapiro was
to speak. A similar free
speech problem is found
here in the UK, which
is probably why (now
ex-minister) Jo Johnson
had called out universi-
ties and threatened them
with fines over their so
called “non-platforming
policies”.
Students are being pro-
tected from ideas that are
not their own, and this is
creating a culture akin to
the protective parent who
doesn’t let his children
play outside for fear of
getting sick. They don’t
develop a response mech-
anism to deal with outside
threats, and this isolation
has greatly contributed
to the rise of Trump and
Brexit. The left was so
isolated from the rest of
the world that real discus-
sion with the other side
happened less, not more.
After years of this kind
of isolation, any kind of
concern about immigra-
tion was not discussed,
but dismissed as racism;
the concerns of white
working-class men were
largely ignored while their
incomes stagnated, their
employability decreased
and their life expectancy
declined. It makes perfect
sense that right-wing pop-
ulists would fill that gap
of concern that the left
was never ready to even
begin to address.
In light of this crisis
of dialogue an unlikely
“hero” of the defence of
free speech has arrived:
University of Toronto’s
in-house public intellec-
tual Jordan Peterson. A
clinical psychologist by
training, this professor
gained notoriety after a
viral video in which he
was seen arguing with
trans activists over the
use of their pronouns. He
blatantly opposed laws
in Canada promoting
compulsory use of trans
pronouns and became
popular after that by
attending talk shows in
defence of free speech.
With over 600K followers
on YouTube, where he has
uploaded a large amount
of lectures, he has become
an internet personality.
In order to understand
his approach to the
defence of free speech, I
recommend watching his
recent heated interview
with Channel 4’s Cathy
Newman, which he did
in his visit to the UK to
promote his new book.
The key moment came
when asked why his right
to free speech should
trump a trans persons
right not to be offended.
He replied: “In order to be
able to think, you have to
risk being offensive. Look
at the conversation we’re
having. You’re willing
to risk offending me in
the pursuit of truth. Why
should you be able to
do that? It’s making me
pretty uncomfortable.”
This response pretty much
sums up what he thinks
about the issue.
This follows on,
however, on from his
critique on the culture of
victimisation that stems
out from identity politics.
It’s interesting how he
takes on questions on
supposed “oppression by
the existing social struc-
ture of the western pa-
triarchy”. He argues that
dominance hierarchies are
not social constructs, but
biological realities that
evolution hardwired into
our minds, as lobsters,
which separated our
evolution trajectory about
350million years ago, also
have these structures.
While his popularity
rose,alotofhisworkcame
to light, revealing a much
deeper (and potentially
less controversial) part of
his thinking. You discover
good practical advice from
a psychologist combined
with theoretical, pseu-
do-intellectual grandiose
ideas which could poten-
tially pass as philosophy.
I loved how he explained
the origins of the concept
of sacrifice: you’d think
primitive cultures are
doing something that’s a
bit odd by burning their
food or their possessions
(maybe even some
people). His insight is the
idea that these cultures
were experiencing a revo-
lutionary realisation: you
can forestall gratification
now, in the present, and
get a payoff in the future.
The discovery of sacrifice
was mankind’s discovery
of the future.
He loves explaining
religious concepts using
Jungian archetypes, is
obsessed with the Soviet
Union —you could play
a drinking game with
the amount of times he
mentions Solzhenitsyn’s
No, it is not his set of
ideas that’s interesting,
but his approach to mo-
tivating people to pick
themselves up and live
a meaningful life. The
advice tends to go along
these lines: stop saying
things that you know to
be untrue, have an aim in
life, and organise your life
around that aim starting
from simple accomplish-
ments. Cleaning up your
room is the most basic
one (he insists so much on
this that it has become a
meme) because your room
is a part of the cosmos you
can control even if you’re
a complete mess of a
human being.
There is a danger,
however, to all his popu-
larity as a pseudo-intellec-
tual YouTube superstar.
His hard stance on identity
politics and certain ideas
of the left has gained
him some support from
factions of the alt-right.
It probably makes no
sense to try to categorize
him into some part of
the political spectrum. If
I had, I’d probably call
him a classical liberalist.
But his notoriety has led
to red-pillers, 4chan shit-
posters and alt-righters to
become a slight part of
his following, creating a
sort of cult-like following
that can make the average
listener a bit uneasy.
And the temptation to
pander to these groups
will always be there,
considering he gets about
$30,000 a month on
Patreon donations. Let’s
just hope he doesn’t fall,
and keeps focusing on
getting people to attempt
to live meaningful lives in
the ocean of chaos that is
the world we live in.
“His approach
to motivating
people to
live full and
meaningful
lives is what’s
interesting”
Gulag Archipelago in his
lectures— and passion-
ately fights the waves of
meaninglessness that arise
from the ashes of this
postmodern world.
What I find compelling
about him, though, is not
really his rich underlying
set of ideas. They are
interesting in their own
way, but have the poten-
tial to be fully dismissed
as pseudo-intellectual
charlatanism. I haven’t
decided if this is true yet,
but the first interview he
had with Sam Harris on
the Waking Up Podcast
ended up being a two-hour
discussion on the nature
of truth which, a priori,
seemed to expose him as
an intellectual fraud.
