Greg Barker’s Obama doc The Final Year is an
exercise in hagiography
The exploration of Obama’s last year in office is greatly lessened by a refusal to criticise.

THE FINAL YEAR
T
here are many
terrible things
about Trump’s
ascension to the
presidency, which – de-
spite the cries of those
who say it was an ‘inevita-
ble’ side effect of the rise
in identity politics – still
comes as a shock, a full
year on from his inaugura-
tion. But one aspect of his
rise to power which, while
nowhere near as tragic as
his decision to withdraw
from the Paris Agreement
or his attempts to gut
health insurance cover-
age, will go on to have an
impact in the future is the
effect it has on the legacy
of Barack Obama.
warfare and a war on
whistleblowers, the arrival
of Trump – crashing down
like a bequiffed, lumi-
nously-orange meteor of
trash – has smoothed out
the potential for criticism.
We now view Obama’s
presidency as the halcyon
days, when there was a
president who was calm,
eloquent, well, and cool.
As a result, our view of
his two terms as president
does not allow room for
nuance, a trap into which
Greg Barker’s documen-
tary The Final Year falls.
Filmed over the
last twelve months of
Obama’s presidency, the
film focuses on a few
loyal staff members who
formed the core of his
foreign policy unit: US
Ambassador to the UN-
,Samantha Power; Secre-
tary of State John Kerry;
White House staffer Ben
Rhodes, who advised on
the Iran Nuclear Deal;
and – for brief periods –
Susan Rice, the National
Security Advisor. All are
united in their wide-eyed
belief that the Obama
Doctrine on foreign policy
has, or had, the potential
to dispel the strong-man
image of America on the
world stage in favour of
a kinder, gentler form of
politics.
And thus we follow the
team around the globe:
Kerry attempting to heal
the US’s relationship with
Vietnam, drawing to a
close a career that has seen
him move from war hero
to anti-war demonstrator
to political giant; Power
listening to Nigerian
mothers whose daughters
have been kidnapped by
Boko Haram; Rhodes
reflecting on the momen-
tousness of the Iran Deal.
We even have an inter-
view with the president
himself, although nothing
truly valuable is revealed.
This is the main
issue with the film: any
problems that might have
existed during Obama’s
presidency, or any
internal tensions between
members of the team are
merely hinted at, is never
revealed.
The last 20 minutes of
the film are the most illu-
minating, as Trump moves
from joke politician to
legitimate candidate to
president-elect – Powers
watches the election night
with other female UN
ambassadors in one of the
most affecting scenes in
the film – but doesn’t tell
us much more than the
reaction these seasoned,
intelligent professionals
have to the thought of
Trump in the White
House: horror at the po-
tential he has to undo their
work.
Ultimately, The Final
Year tells us very little
about the Obama pres-
idency, or the legacy it
will leave. We are given
a surface-level look at
“The arrival
of Trump
– crashing
down like a
bequiffed
orange meteor
–has smoothed
out potential
for criticism of
Obama”
While the Obama years
were marked by an in-
creasing reliance on drone
“While we
have an
interview with
the former
President,
nothing truly
valuable is
revealed
through it”
the lives of his staff, with
real exploration eschewed
in favour of a film that,
at times, reads like a
‘greatest hits’ montage of
a dying age of normality.
All too often, Barker
sands down the edges of
what could have been a
fascinating film, veering
instead into mere hagiog-
raphy.
