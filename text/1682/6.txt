The endowment fund: to divest or not to
divest
As Imperial publishes the results of its endowment fund, Shaul Rosten argues that Divest has
a long way to go and needs a new way to do it.

D
ivest Imperial
is a movement
urging the
University to
divest its endowment
investments in fossil
fuel-related companies,
an approach similar to
that taken by many large
pension funds in recent
years. This week the Felix
team has procured data
from Imperial, giving a
rough breakdown of the
investment areas of the
endowment funds, which
totalled over £266m in
2017.
Although direct
fossil fuel investments
comprised only 1.7%
of the total portfolio,
supporters of the Divest
Imperial movement
will be disheartened
by the fact that this
figure remains almost
steady from 2016, being
reduced by a mere
£400,593; this feels
more like a tailwind of
some poor investments,
rather than an active
divestment strategy. In
addition, the University
only explicitly stated
their direct holdings in
various sectors, with
over 50% of the fund
included in various
investment portfolios.
Upon closer examination
of the precise contents
of the various funds by
the Felix team, it was
determined that, through
these investment funds,
an equivalent of £3.5m
was invested in tobacco
companies, and an ad-
ditional £2.8m in fossil
fuel companies, on top
of the direct fossil fuel
holdings the University
explicitly stated.
Their reasonable
demands for transpar-
ency aside, however,
the Divest Imperial
movement seems, to my
mind, a slightly flawed
approach to ensuring that
the University upholds
its moral standards in a
world of serious climate
concerns. For the first
part, is divestment of
fossil fuel holdings –
which, at £8.8m (includ-
ing oilfield services), are
hardly noteworthy from
the corporation’s point
of view – actually going
to have the slightest
has at its disposal. As a
shareholder (dependent
on the class of shares
it owns), Imperial has a
seat at the table, and this
has been increasingly
used by investment
vehicles to demand
greater Environmental,
Social and Governance
(ESG) awareness and
performance from their
portfolio companies.
Imperial could leverage
this exposure to the
industry, and partner
with similar minded
shareholders, to demand
from its portfolio com-
panies greater R&D
into renewables, and
a weaning off of envi-
ronmentally damaging
fossil fuel projects. This
would actually engage
the companies that are
doing the damage, and
proactively champion
the causes of conserva-
tion and environmental
protection, rather than
simply walking out of
the room whilst they do
it.
This jumps straight
onto the second issue
that Divest Imperial have
not addressed: that some
of the major fossil fuel
corporations are some
of the biggest investors
into renewable technol-
ogies in the world, and
the capital Imperial have
placed into them allows
the University to put
their money where their
mouth is, betting on
companies such as Royal
Dutch Shell, who have
plans to increase their
annual renewables R&D
spending to $1Bn+,
and who have made
bold pledges to tackle
global carbon pollution.
Whilst the data provided
by Imperial in no way
makes it clear that this is
their approach to fossil
fuel investment, Divest
Imperial must consider
these possibilities before
demanding a blanket
divestment, which may
achieve little toward
in the pockets of those
to whom climate issues
are not a great concern.
Overall, I think that
Divest Imperial make
an important point: that,
as a public body that
should be an example
to wider society, it is
important that Imperial
– and other Universities
with large investment
trusts – embrace an
attitude of ownership
and transparency, setting
out clearly and regu-
larly their investment
philosophies, holdings,
and impacts. However,
the simple cry for di-
vestment is perhaps not
the most constructive
way forward. Divest
Imperial, although
sound in principle, must
consider the nuances of
the argument, to forge
a constructive plan to
enable Imperial to use
its financial position to
best tackle global chal-
lenges, in a maximally
effective way.

“Reasonable
demands for
transparency
aside,
divestment
seems to
be a flawed
approach”
their overall moral aims.
There is a third and
final point also yet to
be considered by Divest
Imperial. Yes, the fossil
fuel industry is a gener-
ally damaging one for
the environment, but,
as pointed out above,
Imperial’s divestment
from that industry will
not deter them from
continuing their nefari-
ous practices. However,
what it might do is
hamper the returns of
the Imperial portfolio,
as academic studies
have previously posited.
If Imperial holds these
investments, however,
and sees the financial
benefit of doing so, it
can use this capital to
invest in the various
cutting edge renewable
technologies that flow
freely from the academic
work it undertakes. That
way, at least some of the
profits from fossil fuels
will be being put to good
use, instead of ending up
impact? There are plenty
of wealthy climate
change sceptics, and
sceptical organisations,
who would happily
purchase these shares
and buoy the industry,
with or without Imperi-
al’s help. That is not to
say that because some
people are willing to do
bad things, so should
we; rather, I would hope
that instead it makes
the Divest Imperial
movement think more
carefully about the most
effective way of deploy-
ing the capital Imperial
