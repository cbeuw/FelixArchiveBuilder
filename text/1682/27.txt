ICURFC: New year, same old 2s
L
ast Wednesday
saw the first
match of the year
for Imperial 2nd
XV against RUMS (UCL
medics) 2nd
XV. This was
an opportunity to continue
with our winning form
from before the holidays,
and also to prove to coach
LJ that the fitness work we
had done before Christmas
had not been completely
undone. The match kicked
off and IC instantly put
RUMS under pressure.
We set the tone in defence
early on, with some big
hits coming in from Will
Bolton and happy George
Nicholas. Harry Brady
didn’t take long to injure
an opposition player, and
due to their lack of subs
they were down to 14
men. Poor discipline was
preventing us from taking
hold of the match. A neat
backs move opened up a
hole for Jack Fraser, who
ran over in the corner for
the first try of the match.
5-0toImperial.Aftersome
nice offloads between the
given ten minutes on the
sidelines to reflect on his
actions. Half-time came
and went, and soon Elliot
was allowed back onto the
pitch. We knew we could
be playing better. A dan-
gerous scrum, five metres
from the opposition try
line, gave the forwards
an opportunity to show
everyone how big they
were. The RUMS pack
was driven back over their
try line and Elliot touched
down on the ball for an
easy try. 17-0. A scrum on
the halfway line allowed
the backs to show what
they could do. A perfectly
executed ‘whitey’ ended
up with the ball out wide.
Hugo Koide decided that
the 3v1 was too risky,
so he took the ball into
contact and got tackled.
Luckily, Sam Ha was
there in support for the
offload and some quick
hands put Sorrell over in
the corner. A conversion
from Dan Kirrane made
the score 24-0.
Complacency at having
secured a bonus point
for scoring four tries got
the better of some of us.
RUMS were able to run
again by breaking tackles
and pulling off some
incredible offloads. Par-
ticular mention has to be
given to Tom Johnston,
who managed to draw in
their outside centre and
winger, one of which he
was pretty much giving
a piggyback to, and then
pass it out the back to
Hugo – without looking.
Even their players were
in disbelief. Hugo took
the ball into contact, again
deeming an overlap too
risky. Powerful running
from our forwards
allowed us to get close to
their try line, and sneaky
Elliot dived through the
middle of a ruck to score
his second try. Dan added
the extras to make it 31-7.
A now-tired RUMS team
kicked off again to us, and
some more good hands
down the wing quickly
allowed Sorrell to score
his second try, making
him the second team
member eager to avoid
scoring a hat-trick. Final
score 36-7 to Imperial.

ICU 3rd
XV achieve distinction
W
ithnoleague
fixture, the
ICU 3rd
XV made
their way down to the
London Irish for a merit
tournament. Winning
two of their three games,
they earned just that.
The University of Arts
broke the trend as always,
arriving fashionably late
and five players short. The
opportunity was realised
to volunteer Louis Benson
to play for UAL – Si-Woo
Kim kept him company.
A 12-aside game ensued,
with space to run on both
sides. UAL made the first
mark, but within a minute
ICU’s debutant Sam
Muirhead had got one
back, breaking through
the UALline from his own
half to score. Within three
phases of the restart, ICU
had lost possession and
Si-Woo Kim was breaking
ICU ankles, wherever he
pleased. Luckily, he of-
floaded the ball to Benson,
from whom possession
was quickly turned over.
In the broken play that
followed, the ball ended
up in Joao Pereira’s hands
on the other side of the
pitch to score the try. Now
UAL legs were tiring,
and turnovers became
a regular occurrence.
Although their fullback
was still running hard and
fast, he could do nothing
stop Hicks and Rudman
both running in to score to
finish them off. The final
score was 24-10.
In the second game of
the tournament ICU put up
a strong showing against a
University of Chichester
side four leagues above
them. Despite ICU’s
efforts, they let in two tries
and UCRFC won 10-0. In
the third and final game
of the day, ICU faced the
University of Portsmouth.
This was a breeze, relative
to the games beforehand.
From kick-off, ICU
walked it up the pitch. The
first successful chip and
chase of the day, forced
the Portsmouth fullback to
carry the ball into touch.
The resulting line out,
saw Connor Crook carry
the ball over the line.
Portsmouth were already
tiring. Within two phases
of kick-off, Morgan Ball
had broken through in the
ICU half and offloaded
to flanker-turned-flyhalf
Jespersen to do the
leg-work and score the
try. Somewhere along the
line Rudman managed
to get on the score sheet
again, in a rare manoeuvre
to avoid hat-trick avoid-
ance. The game ended
on a bittersweet tone as
Portsmouth ran in a try to
finish it all 19-5. All in all,
it was a good day out.
