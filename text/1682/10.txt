Hello darkness, my old friend: First Aid Kit’s Ruins
T
he sad Swedish
sisters are back
with their fourth
album, ten songs
of crooning harmony and
synth. Ruins is a breakup
album so pure and candid
it’ll have you crying into
your ice cream about
heartache that hasn’t even
happened yet. The work
is anything but stripped
back – as with any of
First Aid Kit’s albums the
produced, polished vocals
are the star of the show.
Johanna and Klara
Söderberg use their
well-loved accessories
of camp-fire guitar and
synth, but add a twist
of more keyboard and
bass, setting tracks in
this album apart from
any other. Written while
vocalist/guitarist Klara
was mourning the end of
a relationship, Ruins is
beautifully bitter, a reflec-
tion on, what hindsight
shows was, an inevitable
ending.
The album opens with
the tinny keyboard riff
of ‘Rebel Heart’, quickly
providing a sinister
backing for the frustrated
vocals. “Why do I keep
dreaming of you? / Is it
all because of my rebel
heart?”. The repetitive
rhythm feels reluctant
and pained. This senti-
ment, that Klara should
know better and be able
to control her emotions,
permeates the whole
album. On Fleetwood
Mac-meets-ABBA ‘It’s
a Shame’, she confesses
along on a lamenting 50s
waltz with 80s guitar and
keyboards. “Why do I do
this to myself every time?
I know the way it ends.”
The self-berating
continues on ‘Postcard’
“I went and broke my
own goddamned heart”.
The jaunty percussion
mirrors more constructive
reflection. It is difficult to
let go, and some connec-
tion is yearned for, albeit
snarkily. “Send me a line
to everything you’ve left
behind”. The album was
recorded in Portland and
the American influence
is clear, especially on the
plucked strings of ‘To
Live a Life’; even the
accents become more
American, and Klara is
“on the interstate drinking
cheap wine” with gloomy
synth. The band’s Swedish
folk-pop roots are back
on the bouncy ‘Wild
Sweet Love’ and warbling
‘Distant Star’. Title track
‘Ruins’ is perhaps the
single closest to previous
album Stay Gold, but with
a tone too defeated. ‘Hem
of Her Dress’ starts to
bring resolution, with a
folky almost-acapella la-la
singalong and applause
to finish. Finally, the
exhausted ‘Nothing Has
to Be True’ delivers final
mourns: “Oh, I thought
you were home” and
brings closure in the form
of a percussion crescendo,
bringing a cathartic end to
a well contained body of
work.
Today’s Empires, Tomorrow’s Ashes is still relevant

to herself as practicing
“conviction politics” in
the months before her
1979 rise to the office of
Prime Minister. She holds
no candle to Winnipeg-
based thrash-punk band
Propagandhi, an all-vegan
band so dedicated to
environmentalism that
they organize tours to
minimize their carbon
footprint. But it’s not all
kale and tofu; the group
is staunchly committed
to hands-on activism for
a number of anarchist and
radical-Left causes, do-
nating songwriting prizes
to humanitarian projects
and filling their lyrics with
anticapitalist, anti-impe-
rialist sentiments. Eat it,
Maggie.
The band released its
seminal work, Today’s
Empires, Tomorrow’s
Ashes, on February 6,
2001 – 17 years old in the
next two weeks. Themat-
ically, the album centers
around American cultural
hegemony in the wake of
the Cold War, taking the
position that cracks in
the foundation of power
imply an inevitability
to the crumbling of the
empire. This is prescient:
undoubtedly the image
of American society has
declined in recent years
(with the presidencies of
Bush and Trump being
no help for the country’s
reputation and consequent
influence in the world
at large, especially with
respect to social values
and political mores).
With domestic issues
from the opioid epidemic
to stagnant wages, and
Agent Orange being the
face of American diplo-
macy, the US finds itself
taking more and more of
a backseat role in world
affairs, a far fall from the
influence once wielded.
Today’s Empires,
Tomorrow’s Ashes point
fingers at the dark under-
side of US power. FBI
programs to suppress
dissident groups (‘Who
the Fuck Needs COIN-
TELPRO?’), women’s
rights (‘Ladies Night
in Loserville’, where a
female narrator taunts
misogynists with the
sexually-liberated refrain
“I fuck to cum / Don’t
lay your repressed shit on
me”), and immigration
(‘Fuck the Border’) are
all on the chopping block.
The subjects are still
topical: perhaps it is a
sad commentary that the
same radical statements
made near two decades
ago are still radical today.
Whatever the political
reading, the lyrics are in
lucid prose, and are worth
a read.
Musically, the album
thrashes. Propagandhi is
possibly the most tech-
nical punk band in the
business, and this album
features musicianship in
spades. The grooves on
thisalbumare,throughand
through, mad; drummer
Jord Samolesky deserves
a special shout-out for his
vibrant toms work. The
guitar lines are intricate
works of blow-the-roof-of
punk rock art, glimmering
for mere seconds before
disintegrating into more
power-chord thrash.
To conclude, Today’s
Empires, Tomorrow’s
Ashes is a powerful
statement by a passionate
band about issues that are
still very much primary
in the public conscious-
ness, brimming with
thrash-punk goodness
reinforcing the album’s
core thesis: here today,
gone tomorrow. Ashes is a
classic album that isn’t to
be missed.

Ode to an ambience, straight Frahm bald Nils
The nimble fingered German electronic producer, Nils Frahm, has returned with a gorgeous new album, and a
freshly shaved head.
N
ils Frahm
stands out to
fans of ambi-
ent music as an
electronic producer and
pianist ready to fill your
brain with a tantalising
fusion of classical com-
position and electronic
reverb. He is an artist who
since the mid-noughties,
alongside his esteemed
record label Erased Tapes,
has brought forth sounds
seemingly from other
worlds. All Melody, his
most recent album, is a
continuation of his ec-
lectic and nuanced music
history, and stands up as
an innovative and stylised
album of its own.
All Melody starts ex-
tremely well. ‘The Whole
Universe Wants To Be
Touched’, a beautiful first
track, uses a sumptuous
arrangement of choral
vocals to immediately
lull the listener into
a calm sway, before
smoothly progressing
into calm electronic
chords reminiscent
of his previous
album, Spaces.
It merges sweetly
into the more upbeat
second track, ‘Sunson’
to create a lovely 15
minute opening.
What is most
compelling
about this
beginning
is its satis-
faction of one of Frahm’s
key talents: his ability to
blend classical themes
and arrangements into an
avant-garde expression,
only to then lift it seam-
lessly into a more acces-
sible, galvanised form. He
merges the initial vocals
into a thematic warp, that
then gives way to a rich,
bouncy, electronic sound.
An understated
ambience is then estab-
lished and perpetuated
in the follow up track
‘A Place’, before Frahm
shifts to familiar territory
on ‘My Friend the Forest’.
Here, Frahm seems to
revisit his work on one
of his subtler albums,
Screws, and pours out
a tentative and melodic
electronic piano piece.
Amongst this compo-
sition lies the familiar
clicks and clacks of his
piano, recorded as such to
preserve the mechanical
feeling of the instrument.
The lamenting notes that
dance out of his fingers
are heartrending and de-
lightful.
By the album’s
midpoint, Frahm has
very much created a
sense of journey or want
thereof, a feeling perhaps
best termed in his native
tongue as
wander-
“Turning
the erratic
nature of
experimental
ambient music
into more
layered and
formulaic
tracks that
edge towards
beautiful
crescendos”
lust. Tracks like ‘Human
Range’ and ‘Forever
Changeless’ tinkle by and
draw the listener deeper
into the music, before
reaching towards a rather
epic middle portion of the
music. I found myself
mourning the transition of
certain musical sections
into others, desperate to
hold onto a known and
rewarding sound. But,
despite this, the exchange
of a beautiful moment for
the pursuit of a new one
drives the piece into a ful-
filling complexity. Frahm
seems to be fully aware of
this, building his songs to
a climax before changing
direction, offering re-
flective mid points to the
listener and novel musical
pathways for explore.
Despite this heaped
praise, the album is not
perfect. There are times
when tracks feel drawn
out, and sometimes
the ambient sounds
created seem to merely
act as filler between
compositions. The final
track, ‘Harm Hymn’ is
perhaps the worst. The
album is screaming for
a more powerful ending,
another blissful moment
or delicate piano tug at
the heart, yet instead it
stalls with a rather boring
collection of warps. It
begs for a bang or even a
fade, but instead plateaus.
Tracks like ‘Fundamental
Values’ and ‘Momentum’
also seem rather plain
when compared to earlier
moments. It is at these
latter points when the
album is dullest, me-
lodically at its weakest,
and most contextually
directionless compared
to its vivid and exciting
beginning.
All Melody has a lucid
texture and a beautifully
unique feel. It combines
many of the skills
demonstrated on previous
albums like Spaces or
Screws to create some-
thing genuinely moving,
providing a beautiful
ambience in which to soak
up transcendent vibra-
tions. Frahm excels at
turning the erratic nature
of experimental ambient
music into more layered
and formulaic tracks that
edge towards beautiful
crescendos, and offers
an intersection between
classical and modern
approaches to create
something accessible yet
artistically challenging.
All Melody is a brilliant
culmination of his ex-
cellent repertoire as a
pianist and an electronic
producer and provides a
stimulating, immersive
listen. However, it loses
some of its grace towards
the end, causing holistic
damage to an otherwise
flawless album.
