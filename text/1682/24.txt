Imperial endowment fund revealed: mostly Bitcoin

An analysis of the
investments by
Imperial has found
that the vast majority
of them are in
cryptocurrencies.

A
n analysis of
Imperial Col-
lege London’s
e n d o w m e n t
fund by Hangman has
found that roughly 97%
of all the College’s as-
sets are currently tied up
in cryptocurrency. The
discovery has caused a
range of opinions across
campus, from excite-
ment to the chilling sus-
picion that the College
is now worth literally
nothing.
The analysis, undertak-
en by Negafelix, Hang-
man’s Editor-in-Chief,
was performed on data
obtained from a series of
Freedom of Information
acts asking for the history
of the College’s endow-
ment fund investments.
While just last year the
fund was valued at around
£ 250 million, and was
invested in a wide-rang-
ing portfolio, including
gold mines, fracking
companies, and Greene
King breweries, the 2017
fund consisted of 12,557
bitcoins, 66,810 ethere-
ums, and 110,284,514
Cardanos. After sitting
down with members of
Imperial’s DoCSoc, who
patiently explained what a
cryptocurrency was multi-
ple times to the Hangman
team,theanalysisrevealed
that these investments
made up £240 million*
nearly the entirety of the
endowment fund’s assets.
The remaining invest-
ments, which total a mere
£1.2 million, have been
Fulham Slug.
The news was wel-
comed by a number of
students, who felt that it
showed the College was
looking forward into the
future. Thomas Rhidian,
the Union’s Ethical
Arbitrator, said that the
move to cryptocurrency
was morally right: “it’s
about time we completely
divested from large cor-
porations like Shell or Im-
perial Tobacco, which are
just making ourselves and
the planet sicker. I always
say ‘better to have no
money than dirty money’,
and I am glad the College
is taking this on board,
making a symbolic in-
vestment in products that
are essentially completely
pointless and worthless.”
Michael Lim, an MBA
student from the Imperial
College Business School,
said that the investment
was “sound”: “yeah, I
read this article in Forbes
about this a few months
back – cryptocurrencies
are definitely a safe bet.
There’s no limit to how
high they can climb.”

When approached for
comment, a member of
DoCSoc’s committee told
Hangman: “Oh my god,
I am not going to explain
how Bitcoin works to
you another time. And
stop asking us where the
fucking mines are.”

A class action suit
has been launched,
claiming that the
timetables breach the
European Convention
on Human Rights.

mperial College
London is gearing
up for a court
battle next month,
as a group of students
are taking them to
court over their exam
timetables, which they
describe as “literally a
form of torture”.
The legal battle was
launched earlier this week,
were emailed out their
examination schedules for
the summer term. A group
of students numbering
nearly 50 – mainly physics
undergraduates – imme-
diately launched a class
action suit against the
College, arguing that the
structure of the timetable
breached article three of
the European Convention
on Human Rights, which
prohibits torture.
In a statement issued
earlierthisweek,thegroup
said: “it is clear that what
Imperial is engaging in
here is an illegal, hostile,
and cruel move. Giving us
five exams in five days is
a form of mental torture,
designed to break our
souls and spirits. It’s a
cruel and degrading form
of treatment – what we
might expect in a dicta-
torship, or during ACC
night, but certainly not
from a university faculty”.
The newly-appointed
Vice Provost (enhanced
coercive interrogation
techniques), Thom Yar-
mouth, told Hangman
that the timetable was
“completely appropri-
ate”: “here at Imperial,
we pride ourselves on
world-leading research,
which allows us to supply
the global community
with cutting-edge technol-
ogies. We also sometimes
have to do things like
teaching undergraduates,
which is a job we take very
seriously. By liaising with
governmental experts
in the UK and USA, we
have found that, through
these “special methods of
questioning”, candidates
give up much more infor-
mation that they would
otherwise, meaning they
are more likely to perform
well on the exam.”
Students questioned
the methods used by the
College: “Yes, putting this
much pressure means I
cram as much information
into my head as I can,”
said Harry Courtney, a
final year physicist, “but
when the exam period
is over I have difficulty
fitting back into civilian
life. Last year I forgot
my own name, all I could
think about was the Dirac
notation”
When asked about
whether she thought
Imperial were practicing
torture, Gertrude Bloom,
a second-year biochemist,
told Hangman: “are you
talking about those big
light-up straw things they
have in the Union Bar
now? I saw someone being
force-fed a VK through
one last week – is it a form
of waterboarding?”
The case is set to go to
trial on the 17th February.

This week your holiday
goes awry when you
confuse Mykonos for
Davos. Turns out you
can’t wear beach casual
to international meetings.
This week you decide
to broaden your
gastronomical horizons.
Now you’ll be eating at
Fusion and the Union.
This week you’re so
desperate to get out
of labs you somehow
manage to haul the mass
spectrometry machine
to the Union’s waste
amnesty.
This week you’re on level
five of the library when
they close off access.
Well, guess you live here
now.
This week you throw
your full weight behind
the UCU’s planned strike
action, and encourage
academics to strike
throughout the month of
May. Can’t fail exams if
they’re cancelled.
This week you’re a
sabbatical officer, and
you can’t wait for the
Leadership Elections.
Finally, someone you can
pass this curse onto!
This week you won’t
stop talking to all your
friends about the Oscar
nominations, and what
they mean for the
industry. You have got no
friends.
This week the frustrations
of Union Council are
magnified by the fact
attending meant you
missed yoga. You punch
the wall in 568 and
shatter your hand.
This week is the week
you realise that you
should have really
knuckled down about
four months ago. Oh
well, there’s always next
year!
This week you’re the
Union Bar, and you’re
embarrassed that your
venerable history has
been disgraced by the
addition of giant fucking
light-up straws.
This week you’re the
Horoscopes Writer, and
you’ve finally written
enough of these fuckers
to go home.
