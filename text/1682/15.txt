The Shape of Oscars
FILM

W
hile not as
glamorous
as an affair
as the big
ceremony at the Dolby
Theatre in the Spring,
the announcement of
the Academy Award
nominees is nonetheless
an anticipated event.
Streamed live from the
Samuel Goldwyn Theatre
in Beverley Hills, an-
nouncers Tiffany Haddish
andAndy Serkis had some
surprises up their sleeves
on this Tuesday lunch-
time. Let’s take a look at
the shocks and snubs in
the major categories; and
where the Oscar races
stand ahead of the handing
out of golden statuettes on
March 4th
.
Best Picture Heading
To Fox Searchlight
Fox Searchlight is
havingayeartoremember,
with two of their pictures,
The Shape of Water and
Three Billboards Outside
Ebbing, Missouri going
head-to-head for a number
of the biggest awards, in-
cluding the most coveted
prize of all: Best Picture.
The Shape of Water has
lead for nominations at
most of the major awards
ceremonies this season,
and continued this trend
by raking in a whopping
13 nods, a total bettered
only by All About Eve,
Titanic and last year’s La
La Land in Oscar history.
It won the Producers
Guild of America and
Critics’ Choice Moive
Award for Best Picture,
putting it in good stead
to go all the way with
the Academy. Three
Billboards will have a say
on that though; having
won the notoriously Os-
car-predictive Audience
Award at the Toronto In-
ternational Film Festival
and picked up the Golden
Globe earlier this month,.
Martin McDonagh will
be pleased with his film’s
haul of seven nomina-
tions, if a bit miffed that
he was snubbed for Best
Director.
The rest of the
nominees were largely as
expected, with Call Me
by Your Name, Lady Bird,
Get Out, Dunkirk, and
reviews of the year only to
be ignored by all the major
guilds. Paul Thomas An-
derson’s romantic period
piece is peaking at just the
right time for voters, and
Focus’ release strategy
much be commended.
Mudbound, The Big Sick,
The Florida Project,
Wonder Woman, and I,
Tonya were all locked out.
Acting Awards: A
Foregone Conclusion
The Screen Actors
Guild Awards are the
strongest predictors for
Academy success, and
with those being handed
out a couple of days before
the Oscar nominations are
announced, we are robbed
of a little excitement as
we already know who will
win.
Best Actor nominees
- Daniel Day-Lewis
(Phantom Thread),
Timothée Chalamet (Call
Me by Your Name), Daniel
Kaluuya (Get Out) and
Gary Oldman (Darkest
Hour) - were already
locks, with Oldman the
heavy favourite to win for
his portrayal of the early
part of Winston Church-
ill’s premiership. The fifth
slot was between Golden
Globe winner James
Franco (The Disaster
Artist) and screen legends
Tom Hanks (The Post)
and Denzel Washington
(Roman J. Israel, Esq.).
Franco was the front
runner for that last slot
but sexual misconduct
allegations appear to have
derailed his campaign,
with Washington stepping
in as the Academy’s
snubbing of former
darling Hanks continues.
Frances McDormand
(Three Billboards Outside
Ebbing, Missouri) is a sure
thing to pick up her second
Best Actress win, while
Saoirse Ronan (Lady
Bird), Margot Robbie (I,
Tonya) and Sally Hawkins
(The Shape of Water) were
always guarantees for ac-
knowledgement. Annette
Bening (Film Stars Don’t
Die in Liverpool) was
once again given the cold
shoulder to allow the
Academy to give Meryl
Streep (The Post) her
customary nomination.
InitialSupportingActor
favourite Willem Dafoe
(The Florida Project) was
expectedly nominated,
while new front runner
Sam Rockwell (Three
Billboards Outside
Ebbing, Missouri), who
is sweeping all the awards
going, was nominated
alongside cast-mate
Woody Harrelson, the
first dual nominees in this
category since Harvey
Keitel and Ben Kingsley
for Bugsy in 1991. At the
age of 88, Christopher
Plummer (All the Money
in the World) became the
oldest ever actor nom-
inated for an Academy
Award, a remarkable job
considering he stepped in
to reshoot the disgraced
Kevin Spacey’s scenes in
the just over a week, with
a day’s notice. Rounding
out the Supporting Actor
nominees were Richard
Jenkins (The Shape of
Water), ending Armie
Hammer and Michael
Stuhlbarg’s hopes of
scoring for Call Me by
Film Editor Ashley Luckyram reacts to landmark nominations for first-timers Greta Gerwig and Jordan Peel, as
Phantom Thread and Paul Thomas Anderson ghost into the reckoning.
Loveless, Phantom Thread, and The Shape of Water could all be taking home awards come March // Altitude; Universal; Fox Searchlight
Your Name.
TV stalwarts Allison
Janney (I, Tonya) and
Laurie Metcalfe (Lady
Bird) will do battle for
the Supporting Actress
award, with Janney widely
anticipated to come out
victorious. Mary J. Blige
(Mudbound) and Octavia
Spencer (The Shape of
Water) had been fairly
good shouts for nods and
duly delivered. While
Hong Chau (Downsizing),
Holly Hunter (The Big
Sick) and Kristin Scott
Thomas (Darkest Hour)
had hoped to be in with a
chance, Lesley Manville
(Phantom Thread) has
come storming through
late on for an icy and
powerful turn that goes
toe-to-toe with the great
Daniel Day-Lewis, so
much so that she may
even be a surprise winner.
Best Director Proves
Surprisingly Unpre-
dictable
Well, well, well.
Heading into Tuesday,
we knew who three
of the Best Director
nominees would be:
Guillermo Del Toro (The
Shape of Water), Martin
McDonagh (Three Bill-
boards Outside Ebbing,
Missouri) and Christopher
Nolan (Dunkirk). Turns
out we didn’t know shit.
Golden Globe winner Del
Toro and fellow Directors
Guild ofAmerica nominee
Nolan booked their seats
at the Dolby Theatre with
little fuss. After the clam-
ouring of numerous men
and women in the film
industry and the general
public, riding the wave
of momentum provided
by the #MeToo and
Time’s Up movements,
Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird)
followed up her National
Board of Review win
and Directors Guild nod
to become only the fifth
female nominee for Best
Director in history, and
first in almost a decade.
Similarly, Jordan Peele
(Get Out), another first
time director, became
only the fifth black
director in history to
earn an Academy Award
nomination. Regardless
of whether you think
Gerwig or Peele deserved
their spots ahead of
BAFTA nominees Denis
Villeneuve (Blade
Runner 2049) and Luca
Guadagnino (Call Me by
Your Name) or Golden
Globe nominees Steven
Spielberg (The Post)
or Ridley Scott (All the
Money in the World),
they did earn the highly
predictive Directors Guild
nominations; so their nods
weren’t entirely unex-
pected, especially given
the pressure to reward
more female and ethnic
minority filmmakers, and
the growing diversity in
the Academy voting pool.
So then the five Directors
that they would plum for
Anderson, a man who
is to many of them their
generation’s Kubrick.
Original Screenplay
Far More Competitive
Than Adapted
Oscar stalwart James
Ivory’s script for Call
Me by Your Name will
win come March – there
isn’t any competition. In
the end solid efforts from
Mudbound, The Disaster
Artist, Molly’s Game and
Logan made up the rest
of the nominees, but it
almost feels as though one
could have desperately
scribbled down the ingre-
dients from the back of
a bottle of Heinz tomato
ketchup on a napkin five
minutes before the nomi-
nations went out and still
been in with a chance of
an Adapted Screenplay
nod. In stark contrast
the Original Screenplay
category is hotly contest-
ed. Greta Gerwig (Lady
Bird), Jordan Peele (Get
Out), Martin McDonagh
(Three Billboards Outside
Ebbing, Missouri) and
Guillermo del Toro &
VanessaTaylor(TheShape
of Water) collected their
projected nominations,
while Emily V. Gordon
& Kumail Nanjiani’s
The Big Sick managed
to gazump Paul Thomas
Anderson’s National
Board of Review-winning
Phantom Thread, even
amidst the latter’s startling
success. Other hopefuls
from The Post, Dunkirk
and I, Tonya were rightly
left out, though would
surely have been amongst
the nominees were they
competing in the adapted
category.
Best Foreign Lan-
guage Film Wide
Open
This is always a tough
category to predict. The
Academy has a very
bizarre and convoluted
way of voting, involving
bands of films that are
then drawn into a shortlist
partly by popular vote and
partly by the decree of
an executive committee,
from which five nominees
are then chosen (see
what I mean when I said
‘convoluted’). Loveless,
A Fantastic Woman and
Palme d’Or winner The
Square all picked up their
expected and deserved
Foreign Language Film
nominations. Golden
globe winner In the Fade
and Angelina Jolie’s First
They Killed My Father
were both shut out. One
would have expected
superb Israeli entry
Foxtrot to jump in. Yet
instead, the also well-re-
ceived On Body and Soul,
and the little-seen The
Insult made the cut. It’s a
five-horse race from here
on out.
Auteur-Driven Block-
busters Dominant
Technical Categories
Big budget fayre often
sees its best chances of
Oscar success in the tech-
nical categories, where
they can be rewarding for
their astonishing visual
effects and sound mixing.
This year saw a number of
directors, many of whom
have proven themselves
on the indie circuit, take
their meticulous visions
to the tentpoles. Denis
Villeneuve (Blade Runner
2049), Rian Johnson (Star
Wars Episode VIII: The
Last Jedi), Edgar Wright
(Baby Driver) and Matt
Reeves (War for the
Planet of the Apes) will
be pleased to see their
films pick up five, four,
three, and one nomination
respectively. Another
big budget scorer in the
technical categories was
Christopher Nolan’s
Dunkirk, also breaking
into the higher end of the
awards with Best Picture
and Best Director nomi-
nations.
The Best Cinematogra-
phy nominations matched
up to the American
Society of Cinematog-
raphers nominations,
meaning Rachel Morrison
(Mudbound) at long last
became the first woman to
be acknowledged in that
category. That was part of
wider success for Netflix,
with the streaming
network finally cracking
the Academy on its way
to four nominations (the
Academy in general has
been more accepting in
recent years, and super-
hero flick Logan also got
a major category nomina-
tion for Adapted Screen-
play, only the second of its
kind after Heath Ledger’s
Supporting Actor win
for The Dark Knight 9
years ago). Unfortunately
for Morrison, she will
have to wait for a win,
as it is surely now Roger
Deakins’ time. Forget the
likes of DiCaprio, Pacino,
Scorsese, and Bridges
having well overdue wins;
this is Deakins’ 14 nomi-
nation, and his stunning
work on Blade Runner
2049 is heavily favoured
to see him break his duck.
After landmark work
in his past collaborations
with Paul Thomas,
Anderson in There Will
Be Blood, The Master
and Inherent Vice, Jonny
Greenwood (Phantom
Thread) finally earns a
long outstanding nomina-
tion for Original Score.
The Radiohead guitarist
is up against veterans
Hans Zimmer (Dunkirk),
John Williams (Star Wars
Episode VIII: The Last
Jedi) and Cater Burwell,
while Alexandre Desplat
(The Shape of Water) is
the narrow favourite.
“The Shape
of Water has
come into
the race
strong, with
a record 13
nominations”
The Post all there. Focus
Features will almost have
as big a grin on their faces
as Fox Searchlight, with
Darkest Hour building on
strong BAFTArepresenta-
tion to score well here,
as well as a pleasantly
surprisingly nomination
for the much-deserving
Phantom Thread, which
received some of the best
“Greta
Gerwig’s
nomination
reflects the
current climate
of Hollywood”
Guild nominees, Del Toro,
Nolan, Gerwig, Peele and
McDonagh, were the
five Oscar nominees, and
everyone lived happily
ever after. BUT WAIT!
Surefire choice Martin
McDonagh was left out.
Not for another guild
nominee, not for another
BAFTA nominee, and
not for another Golden
Globe nominee. No, in
his stead is Paul Thomas
Anderson for Phantom
Thread, a completely out-
of-left-field but justified
decision. The last couple
of years have shown a
shift in previous voting
trends, with old steadfast
predictors being thrown
out the window by the
younger and more diverse
Academy voting pool.
While they have been
attributed for earning
Gerwig and Peele selec-
tion amongst the elite, no
one seemed to anticipate
Lady Bird has garnered five nominations // A24
