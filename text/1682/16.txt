The Post – confessions of a news editor
N
ot content
with getting
his grubby
hands all over
the American presidency,
Donald Trump has now
invaded the world of
cinema, albeit indirectly.
Just was we have now en-
tered the ‘post-Weinstein’
era, we have also entered
into the ‘Trumpian’ age
of cinema: now all films
that come out need to be
measured up against the
impact the orange troll
has had on the American
psyche. Films that eschew
political commentary
– such as The Shape of
Water, whose prominent
position in Oscar nomina-
tions led Peter Bradshaw
to describe the list as
‘cautious, comfort food’
– are accused of ignoring
the realities outside for
something indulgent;
those that hit us over the
head with dark messages
about the Trump presiden-
cy, meanwhile, such as
The Final Year, are seen
as simplistic.
And then there is The
Post: Steven Spielberg’s
prestige drama about
the unveiling of the
Pentagon Papers by The
Washington Post has been
acclaimed by many Gold-
ilocks-like film critics as
‘just right’ for the level
of scorn it directs at the
Trumpian White House.
Numerous commentators
have seen links between
the political landscape
depicted on screen – the
hostile, paranoid 1970s,
during which Nixon was
itching to prevent state
secrets about the futility
of the Vietnam War from
getting out – and today’s
atmosphere – equally
hostile, equally paranoid,
and with a penchant for
just ignoring the news
rather than suppressing
it. Despite taking place
nearly 50 years ago, many
have said that it might as
well have taken place in
2017.
Except… it really
couldn’t. The Post is a
film completely in thrall
to the 1970s, and – in
particular – to the news-
paper industry as it was
then, a world of clacking
typewriters and hot metal
typesetting. It’s in this
milieu that Spielberg
focuses on his two central
characters: Katharine
Graham (Meryl Streep),
the publisher of The
Washington Post, who
took on the role following
her husband’s suicide;
and Ben Bradlee (Tom
Hanks) the paper’s editor
who is keen to make it
more than just a small-
time outlet. Luckily, that
opportunity lands right on
his desk, when a copy of
a secret government study
into the history of the
Vietnam Conflict – called
the ‘Pentagon Papers’ – is
given to his news team.
The papers, which showed
that the government knew
that the war was unwinna-
ble, had been published in
The New York Times until
they were prevented from
doing so by the govern-
ment. And so Graham and
Bradlee are faced with a
single immense decision:
to publish or perish.
Spielberg surrounds
this with a whole retinue
of creative packaging,
adding in subplots about
Graham’s relationship
with the American estab-
lishment, and The Wash-
ington Post’s imminent
public offering. Spielberg
decides, however, to keep
most of the focus on the
central pairing, and it’s a
wise choice, since it can
be difficult to care about
the surrounding baggage.
Streep and Hanks are sim-
ilarly supported by one
of the most star-studded
casts I have ever seen in
a film – particularly good
turns come from Carrie
Coon, Sarah Paulson, and
Alison Brie, who draw
attention in a way that is
impossible not to notice.
With The Post we have
a director at the top of his
game, working with two
of the most well-respect-
ed actors; all three are
industry veterans, and as a
result The Post never feels
anything short of profes-
sional. From the three act
structure to the moving
speeches, it hits all the
notes you would expect
it to along its two-hour
runtime.The main issue is,
however, that the subject
matter is simply not as
exciting as we might hope
it to be. Unlike Spotlight,
another drama centred
around contentious stories
– in this case the sexual
abuse scandal that rocked
the Catholic church in
Boston – The Post is
focussed on the process
of publication, and not
on the inner workings
of journalism. The team
at The Washington Post
go to no great pains to
uncover the papers – they
are simply dropped in the
office one day – meaning
that the main decision
is simply whether or
not they’re going to risk
litigation and publish.
And they do – a fact that
I believe the vast majority
of the viewers will enter
the cinema knowing. As
such, The Post is starved
of the oxygen of frisson
and intrigue that made
Spotlight so successful.
Long scenes are taken up
with Graham agonising
about what the right thing
to do would be, meaning
that once the papers have
been published we’re
treated to a whistle-stop
tour of the ensuing legal
battle – while skipping
over the fact that Daniel
Ellsberg, the official who
leaked the papers, was
sentenced to 115 years in
prison.
While The Post is cer-
tainly a well-made film
– well-acted, well-shot,
well-scored – it fails to
reach the levels many had
hoped it would. Spielberg
has attempted to wrap a
traditional investigative
journalism film around a
structure that is actually
about publishing. One of
the main risks is that the
investors will pull out and
Graham will have to sell
the company; one of the
main goals is to elevate
The Washington Post’s
standing to more than a
local paper. The result is
an enjoyable watch that
leaves little trace in the
imagination.
Steven Spielberg’s prestige drama is nothing short of professional, but lacks frisson and excitement.
