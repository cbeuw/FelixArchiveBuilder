apanese manga
and anime has
something for every-
one: enchanting
soundtracks, remarkable
aesthetics and animation,
nuanced and thought-pro-
voking storylines, and
more. As a media form,
it has always been bold
and refreshing, pushing
the boundary on plots,
character development,
and artistic styles to great
effect. The industry’s
ability to be dynamic and
vibrant is evident in the
sheer variety and quality
of series ranging from
the highly popular and
lengthy trinity: Naruto,
Bleach, and One Piece,
to the more warm-hearted
and cutesy short series

Tsurezure Children. The
following anime series are
a sample of what we feel
offer insightful perspec-
tives to life and society
– enthralling works that
are worth a watch.
violence. Considering the
possibility of bringing
violence into space at a
stage where mankind is
beginning to explore the
cosmos, Celestial Being,
a non-state actor with
four disproportionately
powerful gundams, seek
to stop all wars. As is with
all gundam shows, if you
can find a HD version of
this, you are in for a visual
treat, with outstanding an-
imation and high-voltage
battles involving interstel-
lar fleets and overpowered
mechas.
The show remarkably
weaves together threads
from a multitude of
dimensions: pernicious
effects of war, human
evolution, contact with
extra-terrestrials, energy
politics, the rule of law,
and the abuse of power.
The way characters
(conventional militaries,
Celestial Being, and
other non-state actors and
civilians) are developed in
terms of their backstories
and how they progress
during the series serve to
point out the different mo-
tivations for engaging in
various courses of actions
during conflict. The sheer
diversity of people who
have experienced different
aspects of conflict serve
to make the complex affair
of conflict more relatable.
Take Setsuna, the main
gundam pilot, who was a
child solider brainwashed
into killing his parents or
Andrei Smirnov, a soldier
who resents his father for
having killed his mother
due to a tactical decision
(both his parents were in
the military). On a larger
scale, I enjoyed how the
show discusses big ideas,
such as the appropriate
outlook humanity needs
to grow as a species or
how power is used/abused
by different people and
how can we address it.
With such smooth story-
telling across the scales, it
makes for a profound and
enjoyable show to watch.

MY TEEN ROMANTIC
COMEDY SNAFU
I started this anime
series half expecting a
typical sappy high school
rom-com (which I enjoy
as a guilty pleasure). But
instead it was a witty and
incisive social commen-
tary analysing the nature
of human relationships
and conceptions of the
self. This is one of the
few shows where I would
have to take a break in
the middle of an episode
because the dialogue
would get too real.
We are greeted by the
main character Hachiman
Hikigaya, a curmudgeon
loner with a ‘twisted’
world view, who imme-
diately sees the worst in
people and any situation
he is placed in. To help
rehabilitate him, his
teacher forces him to join
the school’s volunteering
club whose sole member
prior to this was Yukino
Yukinoshita, an attractive
and multitalented loner
who alienated herself after
seeing people’s jealousy
of her beauty and talents.
This club is a bit unique in
that it gets requests from
the other students, and the
club helps the requester
to reach their goals.
Examples of such requests
include guidance on
baking, organising events,
and even asking a girl out.
Each episode showcases
the club’s activities and
the interaction between
our two loners and a host
of other characters, each
with different attributes,
such as Hikigaya’s sister
or Yui Yuigahama, who
after being the first char-
acter to request the club’s
service decides to join as
a member.
The character evolu-
tion is well done, and
it is quite endearing to
see both Hikigaya and
Yukino develop a sense
of humanity. Hikigaya’s
initial methodology for
helping–whilstseemingly
expedient – usually incurs
a high personal cost which
he is willing to bear and/
or often involves working
with darker aspects
of people’s psyche.
However, he gradually
sees that it doesn’t work
out or that he unknow-
ingly hurts his friends
by his self-immolation,
causing him to change
Even ancillary characters
have deeper sides shown
throughout the show,
collectively helping the
viewer become emotion-
ally invested in the show.

GUNDAM 00
The Gundam franchise

11th series, and ran from
2007-2009, with a total
of 50 episodes spread
over two seasons. Set in
a post-fossil fuel world,

MUSHI-SHI
Mushi-Shi is one of the
best examples of story-
telling through an anime
or cartoon series. The
storyline, artwork, choice
of music, and the charac-
ter development are well
done, and work together
harmoniously to delight
the viewer. The series
consists of 46 episodes
spread over two seasons
– season one released in
2005 and season two in
2014.
Mushi are a kind of pri-
mordial and ethereal life
form. They interact with
the world as much as any
animal or plant would.
However, the show
takes on a supernatural
and surreal angle as the
Mushi are only visible to
a handful of people, many
of whom are not even
familiar with them, or
– an anime for all seasons
“Mushi-Shi
often brings in
heavy ideas,
giving the
viewer food
for thought on
many issues”
their interaction with the
normal world is unusual
and mythical. There
are a group of people
called Mushi-Shis who
are trained in the ways
of the Mushi and how
to counteract the effect
of potentially harmful
Mushis. The show follows
Mushi-Shi Ginko, who
is unable to remember
anything before the age
of ten and tends to attract
Mushi to his location. As
such, he is a wanderer, and
most of the time he serves
to drive the plot forward
as the show focuses on the
interaction of people with
the Mushi.
Each episode is
self-contained and typi-
cally starts with someone
or a group of people
interacting with the Mushi
in an unideal manner,
often to their detriment.
Ginko then comes along
and helps the people work
through the seemingly
mysterious ways of the
Mushi and generally helps
to establish a suitable
equilibrium. I quite enjoy
how the show does not
shy away from tragic
endings where appropriate
and it makes the overall
situation a tad more re-
alistic, as neither joy nor
tragedy are forced. In the
abstraction of the surreal,
Mushi-Shi often brings in
heavy ideas, giving the
of us. MX anime keeps your imag-
ination active thinking
about what the protagonist
(or maybe you, yourself?)
could have done to better
colour his campus life.
Fellow students, grab
the opportunity dangling
in front of your eyes.
This anime will definitely
brighten up your mono-
chromatic campus life!
P.S. If you can’t get
enough of the animation,
watch Yoru ha Mijikashi

helmed by the same staff
that did Tatami Galaxy,

placed references to the

and reach a horrific con-

present themselves. That
is just one of the messages
conveyed through a
blend of well thought out
characters and intricate
storylines.
Other highlights of the
anime include an amazing
soundtrack (openings
and endings especially),
and that it stays true to
the original manga’s art
style and storyline. For
those who like the typical
shounen style of action
and friendship, FMA has
plenty of it, yet manages
to maintain a good balance
between action sequences
and thought-provoking
moments.
Although the anime
tells instead of shows at
several points, and has
one too many flashbacks
for my liking (probably
because it is a long series),
it is otherwise a very good
anime. Definitely give it a
watch!
(If you prefer to skip
the flashbacks, you can
try the manga instead,
which is more succinct.
The mangaka, Hiromu
Arakawa, also has two
other good series under
her belt: Silver Spoon and
The Heroic Legend of

TATAMI GALAXY
Ever dreamt of a
rose-coloured campus life
- exciting club activities, a
lovely girl/boyfriend, and
more? Ever wanted to redo
your university choices,
erase those regrettable
Facebook pictures, and
start everything all over
again?
Well, Tatami Galaxy
(Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei)
is almost like a satirical
commentary of that dream
of yours. It’s about a bitter
university student (his
name remains unknown
throughout) who is con-
tinually thrown back in
time to repeat his campus
life, as each time he
regrets how he has lived
it. A set of over-the-top
and extremely lovable
characters surround him
in his ‘quest’, including
his devilish and only
friend Ozu who seems to
thwart his every effort,
and eighth year student
Higuchi with his mysteri-
ous acts.
The anime is immense-
ly quirky, bearing unique
colour schemes reminis-
cent of textile prints, and
humorous dialogue - more
often than not a blunt
and matter-of-fact mono-
logue by the protagonist.
Frequent anime watchers
will find it a breath of
fresh air, whereas new-
comers get to enjoy the
more artsy side of anime.
The opening song is also
absolutely adorable in my
opinion.
There is one downside,
in that some viewers
might consider the
constant repetition of the
same scenario boring,
but I personally felt that
each story was unique and
enthralling. All in all, the

PSYCHO PASS
With screenplay by the
famous Gen Urobuchi
(screenwriter of Puella
Magi Madoka Magica)
and character designs by
Akira Amano (mangaka
of Katekyo Hitman
Reborn!), Psycho Pass is
a thought-provoking psy-
chological thriller through
and through.
Set in the near dysto-
pian future, everyone is
assigned jobs and statuses
based on their Crime Co-
efficient, or tendency to
commit a crime. The start
of the story sees a new
officer, Akane Tsunemori,
joining the Public Safety
Bureau, which oversees
‘neutralisation’ of people
with high Crime Coeffi-
cients. Slowly, through
different encounters and
several freaky incidents,
she discovers the darker
side of what she once
thought was a perfect
societal infrastructure.
Perhaps some of you
might be reminded of the
drama series Person of
Interest. Psycho Pass is
that and more—it raises
questions about morality,
society, and humanity. If
your Crime Coefficient
remains low, does it mean
what you’re doing is
not wrong? Should you
always protect the law? Is
it right to judge a human’s
worth by their tendency to
commit crime? Should re-
lationships be influenced
by Crime Coefficients?
Unfortunately, Psycho
Pass drags out the sto-
ryline in some places,
and the illustration can
be shaky towards the end.
However, the storyline
is gripping, and will take
you on a whirlwind ride
through what it means
to be human and to be
‘right’. MX
