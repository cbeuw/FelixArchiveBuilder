Members of the
University and College
Union are prepared
to walk out over
proposals that could
slash their pensions.

ozens of uni-
versities could
be disrupted by
strike action in
a row over pensions.
Members of the Uni-
versity and College Union
(UCU) voted in favour
of industrial action;
88% backed a strike and
93% supported lesser
action, such as refusing
to reschedule classes
or providing cover for
colleagues. 58.5% of
UCU members at Impe-
rial voted, in line with the
national average of 58%.
The ballot was opened
last November when Uni-
versities UK (UUK), the
group representing UK
universities, announced
plans to reform pension
plans. 61 universities
A
water leak has
closed part
of Central
Library. The
stairs connecting floors
4 and 5 were closed off
on Monday and, at time
of writing, remain inac-
cessible.
The news was an-
nounced by the library’s
Twitter account on
Monday morning. Despite
Leaking library closes recently re-opened area
the disruption, floor 5
remained open and acces-
sible via the elevator and
alternative staircases. No
electronics were affected.
The ceiling, however,
appears to show signs of
water damage.
One student who was
on floor 5 at the time told
Felix: “Security asked
half of floor 5 to clear out
while they started taping
around the area near the
leak. They already had
four empty bins around
the stairs to collect water
dripping from the ceiling.
They then asked a small
part of floor 4 to clear out
too, in order to tape off
the stairs. It took about 30
minutes total.”
Levels 4 and 5 re-
opened last month after
several months of im-
provements to the cooling
and ventilation systems.
400 desks were also
replaced, most of which
now have plug sockets
and USB charging points.
Levels 2 and 3 are ex-
pected to undergo similar
renovations this summer,
with work expected to
be completed by the start
of the next academic
year. The total cost of
these developments is
reported to be £11 million.
A Freedom of Information
request made by Felix last
June revealed this to be
the most expensive refur-
bishment Central Library
has undergone in the past
decade.

could be hit by striking re-
searchers, teaching staff,
and lecturers.
Dr Michael McGarvey,
president of Imperial
College UCU, said in a
statement: “We regret that
strike action would disrupt
courses and classes, but
also think that it is in the
interests of students to
support our dispute. We
believe that it is the highly
irresponsible behaviour
of the employers that has
caused this situation.”
One UCU member who
voted in favour of a strike
told Felix: “In real terms,
my pay is cut every year
due to below-inflation pay
increases; our pensions
are being attacked for the
third time in five years;
and all the while the
scandal of vice-chancellor
pay continues.”
Most higher education
institutes are part of the
University Superannu-
ation Scheme (USS).
Under this defined benefit
scheme, employees
earning less than £55,550
receive a guaranteed re-
tirement income based on
the value of their pension
pot and any investment
returns. Due to rising
costs, UUK intends to end
the defined benefit scheme
and switch all USS
members to a defined con-
tribution plan. This would
link retirement income to
the performance of the
stock market, and means
retirement income could
decrease by 20-25%.
(Although an analysis by
Professor Michael Otsuka
at the London School
of Economics suggests
employees may lose up
to 60% of their pension
by switching to the new
scheme.)
A UUK spokeswoman
said: “Without reform
now, universities are
likely to be forced to
divert funding from
research and teaching to
fill a pensions funding
gap.” The USS claims
to have a funding deficit
of £7.5 billion. UCU
disputes these figures.
Universities minister Sam
Gyimah wrote to fellow
MP Ellie Reeves, saying:
“An independent report
commissioned by the USS
concluded that universi-
ties with USS schemes
would remain strong and
stable for at least the next
30 years.”
Felix’s UCU source
said: “The large profits
made by UK universities
show the money is there,
they are just unwilling to
spend it on retaining high
quality staff.”
“Many of my col-
leagues have discussed
leaving academia because
the pay difference
between academia and
industry is now so great.
I could easily earn double
what I do now if I went
into industry,” they added.
Times Higher Edu-
cation has reported the
reluctance of several
universities to continue
paying these increasing
costs. Imperial is one of
those universities sup-
porting the “necessary”
move to defined contri-
bution plans, with Impe-
rial provost James Stirling
stating the USS “is not
likely to be sustainable”.
In 2015/16, Imperial paid
£80 million into pension
funds. Its profit for the
same time period was
£78 million. Since 2015,
Imperial has reduced staff
expenditure (i.e. salary
and pensions) from 55%
to 53%.
When strike proposals
were first floated last
November, Dr McGarvey
said: “Imperial has spent
nearly £500 million of its
own money over the last
three years on its estate.
The employers cannot
plead poverty, and any
claim that fees will have
to be raised to pay for
staff pensions has no basis
in fact.”
UCU general secretary
Sally Hunt said the USS
“already offers fewer ben-
efits than other schemes
available in universities,
and the proposals would
make matters worse”.
She previously criticised
the ending of the USS as
“the worst proposal I have
received in 20 years of
representing staff”.

Show me the money
T
his week has been
an absolute killer,
for a number of
reasons. First and
foremost, we’ve set up
a dartboard in the office,
meaning my day is now
regularly punctuated by
the steady ‘thwack’ of
darts hitting board (or,
more likely, the wall).
It remains to be seen
whether the Felix Office
becomes more popular
than the Union Bar. If it
does, we'll start charging.
But what has been
taking up much of our
time over the past couple
of weeks has been our
analysis of the endowment
fund – the pot of money
Imperial have set aside for
non-academic activities,
which they invest in order
to generate more funding.
Following a series of
Freedom of Information
requests, we were able to
gather together data on the
last few years of the fund’s
investments, and set about
analysing it hurriedly.
We quickly encoun-
tered a problem, however:
while some companies
were easily identifiable,
other investments were
placed in obscure funds,
which often had hundreds
of smaller investments
within other companies.
With a bundle of enthusi-
asm and a misplaced trust
in the workings of Excel,
we duly set to work,
looking through thou-
sands of pages of financial
documentation to work
out exactly where Imperi-
al’s money is going.
The results made for
surprising reading. While
Imperial makes sure it
has no direct investments
in tobacco, through their
funds they have over £3.5
million invested in various
tobacco companies. Their
excuse is twofold – that
they can’t know what is
in these funds, and that
their make ups change so
quickly they can’t keep
track. With all due respect
to the College, these are
poor excuses. Our team
managed to find out
exactly what these funds
contained, down to the
dollars and cents, over
the space of a couple of
weeks. We also found that
some of these funds have
contained tobacco since at
least 2011, if not before.
The endowment fund is
an issue that comes up
again and again, so there’s
absolutely no excuse for
the College not knowing
where their money is.
Why care about the
fund? You might not
give much thought to the
investments; you might
be too busy being buried
under coursework. You
might even think that in-
vestments in the fossil fuel
industry is a good thing,
since a small amount of
the money will be going
towards renewable energy
– the College certainly
seems to believe this. I
disagree, but no matter.
This story is important
because information is
important. Knowledge,
as we are so often told,
is power, and so knowing
where the money is going
is the first step to even
beginning to try and
change things. And it’s
your money as well. You
are all part of Imperial,
part of one larger commu-
nity, and so decisions that
the College are making
are being made in your
name. I, personally, like a
number of other students
I spoke to, do not want
investments to be made in
the fossil fuel, tobacco, or
weapons industry in my
name. Where these in-
vestments are being made,
they should at least be
done transparently. They
are not. And this is where
we come in. So please,
give the story a read, and
if it upsets you, let College
know what you think – the
change starts with us.
