IC ASTRONOMY
SOCIETY
(ASTROSOC)
W
h e t h e r
you are an
amateur as-
tronomer,
an expert of the night sky,
or simply want to give
stargazing a go, Astrosoc
is the place for you! Here,
you can meet like-minded
people, discuss and learn
about astronomy (or just
about anything), and, of
course, have fun!
We organise a wide
range of events, with the
most frequent ones being
our famous fortnightly
observations. Our tele-
scopes are high-end but
easy to control, and we
are more than happy to
teach anyone who would
like to use them. Once
you get the hang of it, you
are free to explore with
the telescopes yourself.
The picture shown next to
this article was taken by
a member of the society
during an observation, so
there is a lot to see out
there, even in London!
With the craters on the
moon, star clusters and
nebulae, the clouds on
Jupiter, and even the rings
on Saturn, we can assure
you there is no lack of
stellar objects at which
to marvel. This term,
following suggestions
from our members, we
now start the observations
earlier, at 6.30pm. This
means that you don’t
have to wait around for
long after lectures, and
of course there is no need
to stay up late to see the
wonderful night sky! Our
next observation evening,
in collaboration with
Science Fiction Society
who will bring some
space-related TV shows,
will be held on the 30th
January. It will be up on
the eighth floor common
room of Blackett Labora-
tory, fully equipped with
three telescopes as usual
– do feel free to bring
your own camera along
to take some photos. And
not to mention the snacks
and hot drinks we serve
without fail!
Another series of our
popular events are the
regular guest lectures,
where we invite top as-
tronomers as speakers to
give talks on a wide range
of topics, from spacecraft
missions to astropho-
tography, and even black
holes! We have had great
positive feedback and
they are well-attended,
so we would encourage
anyone with an interest to
come along and listen in!
For an upcoming guest
lecture, we have invited
Dr. Roberto Trotta from
the astrophysics group of
Imperial College to give
us a talk on cosmology,
which will be held on the
19th
of February. There
will be time after the talk
to have a chat with the
speaker, and to enjoy the
refreshments provided.
Other than observations
and talks, we also organise
regular visits to observa-
tories and museums. Just
this year, we have done
trips to the Greenwich
Observatory, and to Mill
Hill Observatory currently
managed by UCL. Do not
worry if you’ve missed
those – there will be more
next academic year so
make sure to come along!
Do follow us on
Facebook or drop us an
email for more detailed
information about the
upcoming events, and you
are more than welcome to
come along even if you
are not entirely sure yet –
no membership is needed
to try out our observations
and guest lectures!
We all look forward to
seeing you!
