promised extra
funding for medical

Universities min-
ister Sam Gyimah
has officially
kicked off his tour of UK
universities by visiting
Imperial and announcing
extra funding for medical
research
The Industrial Strategy
Challenge Fund (ISCF)
will provide £70 million
to support projects such as
manufacturing centres to
speed up the development
and production of med-
icines and virtual reality
programmes to aid patient
recovery.
Gyimah met with
several academics to see
how robotics can improve
medical practices. These
projects include Zeno, a

O
xford Student
Union (OSU)
has voted to
boycott the
National Student Survey
(NSS) as part of its pro-
test against “the increas-
ing marketisation of our
education system”.
The OSU resolved to
continue its boycott of the
NSS until controversial
reforms to the higher
Oxford Student Union continues NSS boycott
education sector are
withdrawn. These include
the Teaching Education
Framework (TEF), which
links student satisfaction
to the quality of teaching
at universities. In 2016,
the Royal Statistical
Society stated “there is
no reliable association”
between student satisfac-
tion and teaching quality.
The motion presented
at the OSU student
council meeting states:
“The TEF does not ade-
quately measure teaching
quality.” It adds: “The
NSS has been discredited
as a measure of assessing
teaching quality. Its results
have also been proven to
reflect racial and gender
bias.”
This is the second year
in a row that OSU have
boycotted the NSS over
a continuing row about
the TEF. Under original
plans, NSS scores would
constitute one of three
metrics used to rate uni-
versities as gold, silver,
or bronze institutions.
Although prime minister
Theresa May announced
in October that tuition fees
would be frozen for the
upcoming academic year,
there is no indication that
this freeze will continue
after 2018/19. This would
allow universities to raise
their tuition fees in line
with inflation (or up to
50% of the inflation rate
in the case of bronze-rated
universities).
In response, the Na-
tional Union of Students
(NUS) led a boycott of the
NSS last year, in which
25 individual student
unions participated. ICU
rejected a motion to join
the boycott on the grounds
that the motion had been
submitted too late. The
OSU reports that its
campaign against linking
the NSS and TEF reduced
the University of Oxford’s
response rate from 59%
to 31%. This meant the
results could not be used,
as the minimum response
rate for inclusion in NSS
data is 50%. A total of
twelve universities were
omitted from last year’s
NSS data due to low
numbers of respondents.
Imperial’s 2017 NSS
response rate was 74%.

was also shown how AI

brain scans to aid the di-

Gyimah described the
research being carried out
at Imperial as “brilliant”
and said the new funding
from the ISCF will
“unlock the innovations
that will help people live
better, longer lives”.
He added: “This invest-
ment will not only support
high value, highly skilled
jobs but will develop
lifesaving treatments that
could change lives across
the UK.”
When Gyimah took
over the role as univer-
sities minister from Jo
Johnson in a cabinet
reshuffle earlier this
month, he announced
he would be touring UK
universities. In an article
for The Times, Gyimah
wrote: “I will continue to
visit institutions across
the country to meet with
vice-chancellors, lecturers
and researchers, but also,
crucially, to speak directly
to students.
“I want them [students]
to have a voice and be
heard in the corridors
of power. I’d like to be
thought of as a minister
for students as much as a
minister for universities.

UCAS data have
revealed that Imperial
has overtaken
Oxbridge to become
the least equal
university in England.
Fred Fyles
Editor-in-Chief
I
mperial has the
largest gap between
numbers of students
from affluent areas
and students from disad-
vantaged neighbourhoods.
This makes Imperial the
most unequal university
in England in terms of
socioeconomic status.
Cambridge had the largest
equality gap. Oxford was
the second most unequal
university, while Cam-
bridge was the eighth.
Although both are in the
top ten for socioeconomic
inequality, Oxford and
Cambridge have narrowed
the gap in their entrance
rates. Imperial is one of
two universities in the
top ten to have become
more unequal since 2010.
(The University of Bath
also showed a slight
increase. Applications to
Bath have fallen in the
wake of a scandal over its
vice-chancellor’s pay.)
Seth Fleet, the lead
data scientist for UCAS,
warned the results should
be interpreted with
caution. Universities with
large numbers of students
from London or Scotland
tend to have worse entry
rate ratios due to fewer
people living in areas
classed as the ‘most dis-
advantaged’. Applicants
from disadvantaged areas
are less likely to achieve
high grades at A level or
equivalent and the data
does not consider offer
rates. A number of univer-
sities also recruit a third
fewer students since 2010.
“If we want to get to a
point where things are far
more equitable in terms
of participation in higher
education,” said Fleet,
“the way to do it is to
encourage more people to
apply rather than changing
offer-making practices.”
In response to the data,
a College spokeperson
told Felix: “We firmly
believe that an Imperial
education should be open
to the best and brightest
students, whatever their
background.”
“We have a broad port-
folio of activities, includ-
ing working with schools,
colleges and community
organisations to inspire,
raise aspirations, stimulate
interest in STEM subjects
and support attainment
from primary school
through to A-Levels. We
also offer the most gener-
ous bursary scheme of its
kind of any UK university,
as well as a wide range of
scholarships. However we
know that there is more
we can do.”
“We are working to
review our outreach strat-
egy to understand how we
can improve.”
The gap in admittance
rates between socio-
economic groups was
highlighted in Union
Council this week, where
a paper for the creation
of a Working Class and
Social Mobility Libera-
tion Officer role was de-
feated. The paper, which
was proposed by former
Council member Lloyd
James and seconded by
a number of Council
members, argued that “
issues faced by students
from economically dis-
advantaged backgrounds
are sufficiently unique to
merit dedicated individual
representation.”
Fintan O’Connor,
Deputy President
(Welfare), spoke against
the paper. He told Felix:
“While we all share the
motivation behind the
paper, the proposal could
be improved to tackle this
impression from the op-
position was that it would
be difficult to combat the
problems underprivileged
students face, so we
shouldn’t bother to try.
There was a clear 50/50
split between those who
voted for/against the
paper – the DPW must
investigate further into
the student opinion of this
role,” he said.
James, who proposed
the paper, on the admis-
sions gap data revealed
today: “These data show
that Imperial remains
a bastion of economic
privilege. Perhaps it is no
wonder that Council shot
down a motion to create
an officer responsible for
representation of working
class students. We will
continue to campaign for
greater representation for
these students.”
Ariana Sadr-Hashemi,
Mental Health Officer,
highlighted the need to
“remain aware of our
biases regarding admis-
sion” in response to the
UCAS data. “Clearly we
are not doing enough to
ensure that we attract
and admit all students,
rather than just those from
private schools,” she told
Felix.
She said arguments that
the role would be “set up
to fail” and the officer
“wouldn’t be able to do
anything”, “demonstrate
an animosity towards not
just a Social Mobility
Officer by the work of
Liberation Officers as a
whole.” She added: “My
colleagues have done
absolutely fantastic work
this year, and to hear their
work dismissed during
this meeting was incred-
ibly insulting not just to
them, but to all of us who
work to make the campus
more inclusive.”
The Liberation Review,
which is being carried
out this academic year, is
looking at the structure
of the liberation aspect of
Imperial College Union.
O’Connor told Felix: “The
proposed extension to our
liberation & community
officers should be based
on a partnership with the
students it would repre-
sent, to do justice to our
strategic values: democra-
cy, inclusivity, leadership
and partnership.”

Data from university
admissions body UCAS
reveals, that for 70 out of
132 institutions analysed,
people from well-off
backgrounds are twice as
likely to attend university
than those from disadvan-
taged neighbourhoods.
Ten universities had a
ratio of more than 9:1.
Imperial’s entry rate for
students from advantaged
areas was eleven times
higher than for disadvan-
taged students.

important objective more
effectively.” O’Connor
cited debates at other
student unions, which
suggested “the role would
be tokenistic at best, and
would function more to
single out than to repre-
sent”.
Shervin Sabeghi, the
Royal College of Science
Union (RCSU) Welfare
Officer, was “very disap-
pointed” by the Council
response to the paper.
“The general
dialogue, not a mono-
logue, so I’m looking
forward to discussing
tuition fees, safe spaces,
access to higher educa-
tion, and our potential
post-Brexit, in a robust
and honest fashion.”
It is not known whether
Gyimah spoke with any
students during his visit to
Imperial.
