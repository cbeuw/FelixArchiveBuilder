Imperial's £3.5 million investment in tobacco among other findings in endowment fund analysis
of research projects
looking into preventing
cancer in the future. The
Department for Cancer
and Surgery, part of
Imperial’s Faculty of
Medicine, states “one of
our major objectives is
to enhance cancer pre-
vention”. The department
currently has 29 research
groups working on cancer
prevention, detection, and
treatment.
In a statement, ICSM
Heart – an Imperial
College Union society for
those interested in cardi-
ology or cardiothoracic
surgery – told Felix: "It
has been well-established
that both first- and sec-
ond-hand smoking are
damaging to one’s general
health, and in particular
to your cardiovascular
system. There is no level
at which smoking is safe
and it kills a great number
of people worldwide
every year. In our view,
an institution committed
to fighting diseases should
do so on all possible fronts
and should consider its
corporate social respon-
sibility. There are plenty
problems. One of the
authors of the paper,
which was published in
Cardiology, said: “The
tobacco industry’s efforts
at manipulating scientific
literature as a way to
serve their economic and
political needs continues
to this day.”
ACollegespokesperson
told Felix it was “College
policy not to undertake
research to develop or
promote tobacco products
or to directly invest in
tobacco companies”.
While fund managers are
“instructed not to directly
invest in tobacco compa-
nies, some investments
are in managed funds. The
College and its external
fund managers have no
control over the composi-
tion of those funds, which
change on a continual
basis.”
However, further
investigation by Felix
showed a number of these
funds have consistently
included tobacco in their
portfolio. Fundsmith
Equity Fund, for example,
into which Imperial has
invested since at least
2013, has had significant
holdings in tobacco since
its establishment in 2010.
Imperial currently has
over £11 million invested
in the fund, more than
double what it had invest-
ed four years ago.
Fossil Fuels
Imperial was also found
to have nearly £9 million
invested in the fossil fuel
industry. £6 million of this
was directly invested in
companies supporting and
undertaking coal, oil, and
gas extraction; £3 million
was through investment
funds.
Currently, the College
has over £1.5 million
directly invested in Royal
Dutch Shell, the 7th
largest producer of oil and
gas worldwide. Shell has
previously been accused
of collaborating with the
Nigerian government in
the torture and execution
of activists, and crimes
against humanity. A report
by Amnesty International,
published last year, con-
cluded Shell’s conduct in
Nigeria “amounts to en-
couraging, and, at times,
facilitating the horrific
crimes and abuses com-
mitted by the Nigerian
security forces”.
The College also has
£470,000 in Exxon Mobil,
the 4th largest oil and gas
producer. The company
was previously headed by
Rex Tillerson, who is now
Donald Trump’s secretary
of state. As with Shell,
Exxon has been accused
of facilitating human
rights abuses across the
world. The oil company
was sued by eleven Indo-
nesian villagers in 2001,
who claimed the company
hired security forces to
protect their pipelines.
One complainant said the
forces had “tortured him
for several hours”, during
which time they “broke
his kneecap, smashed his
skull, and burned him
with cigarettes.”
Imperial has a further
£280,000 in BP, £221,000
in Phillips 66, and
£100,000 in Cairn, as
well as £3 million in other
fossil fuel companies
through investment funds.
These findings come a
few months after Imperial
dramatically dropped in
their ethical record. This
year Imperial slipped to
141st
out of 154 univer-
sities, making it bottom
of the Russell Group.
Imperial received a score
of zero for ethical invest-
ment, and People and
Planet reported Imperial
had accepted nearly £24
million in donations from
the fossil fuel industry
between 2009-2014.
While the overall
amount of direct funding
into fossil fuels has
dropped by nearly
£400,000 since last year,
the amount Imperial has
in investment portfolios
has increased by over
£15 million. A significant
number of these funds
include fossil fuel com-
panies within their port-
folios, meaning indirect
investments are likely to
have risen over the past
twelve months.
The issue of invest-
ments within the fossil
fuel industry has come
under increasing scrutiny
recently, as more univer-
sities divest from fossil
fuels. Divest Imperial,
which recently presented
a petition to College
signed by 1,700 individu-
als calling on Imperial to
divest, said: “It's a scandal
that Imperial puts so much
money into the pockets of
the planet's biggest carbon
emitters. We will not stop
pressuring college until it
cleans up its act, divests
from fossil fuels, and
invests in the zero-carbon
future we all want to see”
Imperial also has a
number of departments
dedicated to sustainabil-
ity and climate change,
including the Centre for
Environmental Policy and
the Grantham Institute for
Climate Change. On its
website, College claims
it “recognises the effect
that (our) opportunities
and activities have on
the environment”, and
“seeks to establish an
ethos at all levels and in
all departments towards
“Imperial has
£1.5 million
invested in
Shell, who
have been
accused of
crimes against
humanity”
the People and Planet
University League Tables,
which rank higher educa-
tion institutions based on
protecting and improving
the environment.”
One academic told
Felix: “It is no secret
that Imperial has many
financial connections with
the fossil fuel industry,
some of which support
valuable teaching and
research necessary for
a low carbon transition.
However, the College
should place stronger
emphasis on research and
teaching orientated on
mitigating and adapting to
environmental challenges
like climate change, air
and water pollution, and
rising sea levels rather
than prolonging the use
of damaging fossil fuels.
The world looks to us to
set the agenda of research;
how can we lead from the
front when our eyes are
still squarely focused on
the past and its former
cash cows – fossil fuels.”
Like the tobacco
industry, a number of
fossil fuel companies
have been accused of
propagating misleading
science and data to install
“uncertainty” in public
debate on climate change.
Exxon in particular knew
about the contribution of
carbon dioxide to global
warming since the 1970s,
and instead “worked at
the forefront of climate
denial”.
A College spokesper-
son told Felix: “We share
the concern that climate
change is one of society’s
most important global
challenges. That’s why
we are urgently working
to find ways to mitigate
the impact of fossil fuels
while seeking viable alter-
native sources of energy.
We believe that we can
have the greatest effect by
carefully optimising our
endowment to invest in
ground-breaking research
and education.”
Weapons
The analysis also
revealed the College is
currently investing over
£3 million in arms compa-
nies, the majority through
direct investments.
Imperial has invested
£2.2 million in Lockheed
Martin, which is the
largest arms company
in the world, with over
$35 billion in sales. The
money Imperial has been
investing in Lockheed
Martin has dramatically
increased since 2016,
and now stands at nearly
double what it was a year
ago.
Lockheed Martin de-
veloped the missiles used
in the Trident nuclear
deterrent system, whose
lifetime replacement costs
have been estimated to be
as high as £205 billion.
Lockheed Martin is also
responsible for production
of the Javelin and Hellfire
missiles, both of which
were heavily used during
the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
The university has a
further £500,000 invested
companies, including
some of the largest in
the world. £9 million is
direct investments, while
£7.3 million is invested
through investment port-
folios.
The amount of direct
investment has nearly
doubled since 2013,
and includes £2 million
in Novartis, which last
year made $6.6 billion in
profits. Imperial also has
£1.25 million invested
directly in Pfizer, and
nearly one million pounds
invested in GlaxoSmith-
Kline (GSK). In 2012,
GSK was made to pay
$3 billion in charges after
they were found guilty
of failing to report safety
data and promoting drugs
for unapproved uses.
While these pharma-
ceutical companies are
responsible for the de-
velopment of new drugs,
there is concern about the
role public funding plays
in funding drug creation
that disproportionately
benefits companies’
profits.
A 2017 report by
STOP AIDS and Global
Justice Now found the
UK government was the
second largest funder
country, after the USA,
for research and devel-
opment into diseases
predominantly affecting
poor countries. However,
they pointed out “there is
no guarantee that patients
in the UK and beyond
will be able to access the
medicines at an affordable
price,” and argued that
“in many cases the UK
taxpayer pays twice for
medicines: first through
investing in R&D, and
then by paying high prices
for the resulting medicine
once ownership has been
transferred to a private
company”. In 2016/17,
Imperial received £143
million in public funding
grants.
Felix spoke to Univer-
sities Allied for Essential
Medicines (UAEM), a
student-led organisation
that lobbies to improve
access to medicines glob-
ally: “If public institutions
are to make investments
in the stock market, it is
obvious that this should
be done transparently, and
with robust safeguards
against these financial
interests influencing what
research is done, how
research is done, and what
is done with the research.”
“The research agenda
– decisions on where
research funding and
efforts should be focussed
– should be guided by
the public interest and a
spirit of scientific inquiry.
Imperial has £3 million in arms companies // Felix
“The amount
invested in
Lockheed
Martin has
doubled since
last year”
in Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries, which is the
largest arms company
in Japan, responsible for
over $3 billion worth of
arms sales.
The university also
has around £500,000
in indirect investments,
including funding to BAE
Systems and Rolls Royce,
two of the UK’s largest
arms companies.
Pharmaceuticals
Finally, the analysis re-
vealed Imperial currently
has over £16 million in-
vested in pharmaceutical
“Some
students were
concerned
about public
funding being
used for
big pharma
research”
Students, scientists, and
the public should be wary
of profit motives guiding
research decisions.”
As direct investments in Fossil Fuels have decreased,
indirect investments in the industry have risen

Investment Fund
Direct investments in Fossil Fuels
have decreased from
£6.2m in 2013 to £4.5m
...but the total in Investment Funds
has risen to £131m, much of which is
invested in Fossil Fuels
“Further
investigation
showed
some of the
investment
funds had
included
tobacco since
2013”
of other ways to invest
money sensibly.”
Tobacco companies
have also been indicted
in manipulating scientific
research. A 2007 study
found tobacco companies
funded and used scientific
studies to undermine the
link between second-
hand smoke and health
“It is difficult to see
how conflict of interest
can be avoided by Im-
perial if it invests in the
same pharmaceutical
companies that contribute
to Imperial’s research
funding, and companies
that may make profitable
products out of Imperial’s
discoveries.”
“Lastly, Imperial lacks
a strong, public policy
that would ensure that
any medicines developed
using the College’s dis-
coveries must be made
accessible and afforda-
ble.”
When asked about the
makeup of the endow-
ment fund, a College
representative told Felix:
““As an organisation
with charitable status,
we have a responsibility
to carefully manage our
assets to maximise their
long term contribution
to our academic mission.
This includes optimising
investment return to
support the College’s
research and teaching
activities.”
