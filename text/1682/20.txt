T
his time two years
ago, I was on my
way to a spon-
taneous trip to
Copenhagen. The spring
term had just started, and
on Friday of week one, we
hopped on an Uber to go
to the airport as quickly
as possible. I finished my
last lecture of the day at
6pm, and the flight was to
depart at 8.45pm. I had to
hurry back to my room,
get my stuff, and leave.
This was the beginning of
a weekend in Denmark.
We were delighted to find
out that it was snowing
there!
Day One
As we had limited time
in the city and wanted
to see as much of it as
we could, we decided to
go on a walking tour. It
was a free walking tour
in English that departed
from the City Hall and
lasted about 2.5 hours. It
was freezing and snowing
outside (-2o
C) but we had
a 30-minute break in a
warm café near Nyhavn,
the famous harbour in Co-
penhagen. We ate quickly
and then headed out to the
snow for more photos.
The highlight of the tour
was the Little Mermaid,
a small bronze sculpture
inspired by a fairy-tale by
H. C. Andersen. We also
passed Amalienborg, the
residence of the Danish
royal family, where we
learned the reasons the
Danes are considered the
happiest citizens, despite
not seeing much sun and
paying huge taxes. (Hint:
it’s because they receive
many services for free.
For example, medical
treatment).
You can find these
kind of tours in different
European cities (we took
one in Kraków as well),
and they are really good
if you want something
cheap. Although they are
named “free”, you are
expected to give a tip at
the end, based on how
much you liked it. But
again, it will cost less than
going on a proper walking/
sightseeing tour. Another
advantage of such tours
is that the guide wants to
make a good impression
to get more tips, so you
can assume that he/she
will be friendly, funny,
etc. My advice on tipping
is to give half the amount
you would give on a paid
tour per person.
In the afternoon, we
visited the Guinness
World Records Museum,
an interesting small
museum featuring infor-
mation about worldwide
records. After that, we
walked around the city
centre and then returned
to the hotel, as it was as
cold as -6o
C at night, the
lowest temperature I had
ever experienced.
Day Two
On our second and last
day, we decided to visit
the Tower of Christians-
borg Palace for the views
across Copenhagen. The
weather was nice: it was
sunny and everything was
covered in snow, and we
could enjoy some great
views. The entrance to the
tower was also free.
Our next stop was
Christiania, in the area
of Christianshavn. The
district has its own inter-
esting story with hippies
and conflicts between the
locals and the government
that is worth keeping
in mind before visiting.
After that, we collected
our luggage from the hotel
and headed to the airport.
The quickest and cheapest
way was by train.
In general, Copenhagen
is an expensive city, but
with a bit of planning and
a few free attractions in
mind, you can see a lot for
less. Of course, there are
many more things to do:
there are many interesting
museums and palaces to
explore, and don’t forget
the Tivoli Park, Copenha-
gen’s most known amuse-
ment park. Unfortunately,
even though our hotel was
five minutes away from
the park, it was closed for
winter.
Many European countries pride themselves on their (culturally) rich and famous capital cities. After spending a
weekend in Copenhagen, Elina Michaelidou shares some tips and tricks to make the most of this beautiful city
in a short time.

are considered
the happiest
citizens,

seeing much
sun and paying
huge taxes”
Fun Fact
There are more bikes
in Copenhagen than
people! Copenhagen
is a bike-friendly city
and renting a bike is the
cheapest way to move
around.
