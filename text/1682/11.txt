haven’t reached peak trap just quite yet
and Boujee’, they have
only honed their craft for
topping charts whilst still
placing emphasis on the
trap culture they helped
to shape. The album title
says enough.
Beautiful Thugger
Girls
Young Thug
Young Thug’s cadence
has always been one of his
main selling points. On
Beautiful Thugger Girls,
his vocals really shine.
The instrumental and
that he does so well
(‘Family Don’t Matter’,
‘Tomorrow Til Infinity’,
‘Do U Love Me’, ‘You
Said’, ‘Oh Yeah’, ‘Take
Care’) often builds in a
way that is sensual and
exhilarating. Even on the
more downbeat and sober
sounding tracks (‘Daddy’s
Birthday’, ‘Feel It’, ‘Me or
Us’) Young Thug creates a
simultaneously accessible
and intimate atmosphere
for the listener where
trap can often be neither.
This project demonstrated
exactly why Young Thug
is a pioneer of the melodic
trap sound as he continues
to push its boundary,
something that an album
like HNDRXX will only
go so far in attempting.
Playboi Carti
Playboi Carti
This, Playboi Carti’s
debut mixtape, exem-
plifies how simplicity,
repetitiveness, and
ambience can make cloud
trap immediately hypnotic
and addictive. Everything
is minimalistic, including
Carti’s vocals. He fills
pockets in the spacey
production with adlibs or
a line repeated five or six
times. The stand out tracks
on this project, ‘Magnolia’
and ‘dothatshit!’, both
perfectly encapsulate the
“Carti sound” that this
project owes its success
to. Carti’s rhymes float
effortlessly inside, rather
than on top of, fluid beats
that were designed to be
indescribably incomplete
without his presence.
This results in a blissful
daydream aesthetic,
painting the backdrop to
the ultimate trap utopia
of sex, money and drugs
with no accountability to
ruin it, only charisma and
entitlement.
Droptopwop
Gucci Mane
As the undisputed
godfather of trap, with
upwards of 70 projects
since 2005, one wouldn’t
blame Gucci Mane if he
were all but out of new
ideas. However, as proven
by Droptopwop, this is
not the case. There isn’t
a moment on this project
where Metro Boomin
doesn’t lay down a
flawlessly cold and often
sinister sounding pro-
duction. On each track,
Gucci Mane rises to the
occasion with his bars,
sounding confident and
calculated. His flow con-
sistently occupies a lot of
space, somehow sounding
slow and kind of graceful
even when fast paced and
aggressive. When rapping
about the gang lifestyle
he knows so well, Gucci
shows us that lyrical
content in trap can be
insightful and mature. He
takes this a step further on
tracks such as ‘Helpless’,
‘Finesse The Plug Inter-
lude’and ‘Dance With The
Devil’, sharing the darkest
corners of his insecurities
and perversion, laying
himself bare in a way that
makes the listener almost
uncomfortable consid-
ering his butch image.
This project is the sign
of a huge second-wind in
Gucci’s career.
Without Warning
21 Savage, Offset,
Metro Boomin
Without Warning is
probably, technically
speaking, the best trap
project of 2017, brilliant
for many of the same
reasons as Droptopwop.
One of these reasons
is Metro Boomin, the
essential powerhouse
of almost all top quality
modern trap albums. With
this project, he comes
through with similarly
chilling and gruesome
production, making 21
Savage feel right at home
as he delivers mercilessly
menacing and murderous
bars. That is not to say that
this project is so fierce that
it is off-putting, indeed the
cut-throat sound is suffi-
ciently off-set by Offset,
who brings a more upbeat
energy and flair to the
table. Still, there is sur-
prising cohesion between
all three forces. The
rigorous craftsmanship in
the production is obvious
all through the project
but particularly shines
on the ominous sounding
‘Nightmare’, complete
with what sounds like
a xylophone melody
from a child’s haunted
toy box. 21 Savage and
Offset are both similarly
uncompromising in each
of their verses, making
for a project teeming with
bangers.
Luv Is Rage 2
Lil Uzi Vert
Simply put, this is the
most futuristic sounding
trap project to have been
made in recent years,
packed full of ideas that
exemplify the infinite
potential for trap to bring
a unique sound to the
hip-hop landscape. On
Luv Is Rage 2, Lil Uzi
creates a universe, of
which he is the super-
hero. With unforgivably
theatrical production that
challenges the listener and
an inimitable vocal style
that rides it in the most
unconventional and beau-
tifully carefree manner,
Lil Uzi takes us soaring
above the homogeneous
trap sound played to
death in clubs and on the
radio. The first high point
of this album comes in
the form of ‘Feelings
Mutual’; a show stopping
production builds to a
magnificent apogee of
orchestral synths, cutting
and dropping to perfectly
match Lil Uzi’s impas-
sioned cries that mourn the
unspeakable pain of a lost
love. ‘XO TOUR Llif3’
is similar but this time
the track serves as a more
unhinged and reckless
sounding ballad. The
lyrics are heavy, focusing
on love, life and death,
immediately cathartic to
scream out the way Uzi
does, his vocals bouncing
off the beat. Simply put,
this project is experimen-
tal, tragic and triumphant
but passionate all over. In
places, sounds and lyrics
become imaginative to the
point of obnoxious (‘Early
20 Rager’) but that can be
forgiven in a heartbeat
when the genius of the
album’s best moments is
considered.
often country-influenced
trap beats are very sweet
and intoxicating and these
vocals perfectly comple-
ment them. The range
in pitch and the often
beautiful melodies he
brings to songs, whether
in his singing or rapping
or the thing in between

T
oday’s release of
Migos’ Culture
II marks the start
of, what will
hopefully be, another
year of refreshing and
inventive mainstream
trap projects. Last year
was very content heavy
for the genre, yielding
more than a few projects
that provided optimism in
the sound’s longevity and
continued progression.
HNDRXX
Future
From his last few
projects since DS2, it
was clear that Future’s
extreme comfort in
mainstream hip-hop were
bringing a complacency
and repetitiveness to
his sound. HNDRXX
however, was Future’s
attempt at changing up
his chart-topping formula
whilst achieving the same
results by focusing more
on singing and melody.
And, for the most part,
the project delivered.
The production is often
sweet-sounding or playful
with Future slowing
his flow appropriately,
coming off more intro-
spective and humble (‘My
Collection’, ‘Coming Out
Strong’, ‘Neva Missa
Lost’, ‘Sorry’) or happy-
go-lucky (‘Incredible’,
‘Testify’, ‘Fresh Air’). Of
course, this wouldn’t be
a Future project without
a handful of forgettable
filler-tracks and, in places,
it is very evident that
the singing thing isn’t
exactly his forté (it gets
particularly bad on ‘Use
Me’). However, at its best,
HNDRXX raises hopes for
melodic trap.
Huncho Jack, Jack
Huncho
Travis Scott and Quavo
This collaborative
effort between trap’s
heavy weight champ and
its current poster child
was highly anticipated.
The project as a whole
is solid, held back by a
few moments where the
pair lack chemistry or an
idea sounds unfinished.
However, at their best,
Travis and Quavo each
ride the beat seamlessly
and complement each
other nicely with ad-libs
and vocal layering. The
stand out feature of this
project is its production.
Mike Dean comes through
with some of the most
effective trap beats of the
year(‘HunchoJack’,‘Go’,
‘Saint Laurent Mask’,
‘Moon Rock’, ‘Where
U From’). ‘How U Feel’
samples ‘The World II’
by Shigeo Sekito, recog-
nisable immediately from
its use in Mac Demarco’s
‘Chamber of Reflection’.
This is a particular stand-
out moment and accurate-
ly demonstrates how the
sound of modern day trap
can truly transcend its ste-
reotypes. Quavo’s triplet
flow really shouldn’t work
over this sample…but it
just does. It really does.
The Booty Tape
Ugly God
It would seem that
memes and hip hop are
becoming increasingly
symbiotic. Ugly God
stands as testament to that.
This, his debut project, is
packed full of hilarious
punchlines and ridiculous
musings. Something
about the project makes
each song sound like
the intro track of a debut
Ugly God album that this
is not. That is not even
meant in a bad way, and
it is clear that Ugly God
meant for this, ensuring
that the project does not
overstay its welcome at
a brisk 23 minutes. The
dream trap production
and purposefully stupid
subject matter make this a
very entertaining project,
perfect for winding down
to. It has been evident for
a while now that there is
room in trap for music
that is not at all challeng-
ing to listen to, with lyrics
that flow past listeners,
leaving no lasting impres-
sion. Take this scenario
and make the artist self-
aware to the point that
they feel comfortable
sharing their weirdest and
most immature thoughts
(without going full Lil
Dicky) whilst making
beats similarly loose and
nonchalant, and you might
just have something.
Better to rap about stupid
shit than to rap about shit
stupidly.
Pretty Girls Like Trap
Music
2 Chainz
If Views was a trap
album, this would be it.
Pretty Girls Like Trap
Music was one of the most
accessible and coherent
sounding hip hop albums
of 2017 and serves as
a testament to what a
no-brainer the mellow trap
sound is today. Indeed, it
feels as though, despite
the production being
decidedly trap influenced
on most of these songs, it
was very necessary for 2
Chainz to remind us in the
title that this is indeed a
trap album. The big-ticket
features on this thing all
deliver very agreeable
verses or hooks, giving
the mainstream hip-hop
listener exactly what they
would expect and prefer
from each guest – Quavo,
Travis and Swae Lee
each come through with a
catchy hook as opposed to
fire bars; Nicki and Drake
each confidently deliver a
relaxed yet boastful verse;
on ‘Bailan’, Pharrell
production does many
favours for this album,
creating a coherent, cool
mood with switch-ups
and intricacies that keep
the listener on their toes.
The album is a perfect
example of what a high
quality pop-trap album
should sound like.
Culture
Migos
Culture serves as a mas-
terclass on how to make
trap bangers. Song after
song on this album, Migos
use their triplet flow,
perfectly timed ad-libs
and watertight back and
forth to create memorable
hooks and catchy verses.
Their versatility is also
proven on this album;
the three-headed beast
that is Migos can go from
aggressive and bragga-
docios (‘T-Shirt’, ‘Bad
and Boujee’, ‘Slippery’,
‘Deadz’) to more reflec-
tive and subdued when
the beat guides them
that way (‘Big On Big’,
‘Brown Paper Bag’).
This album sounds like
a glory lap from Migos,
and a well-earned one too.
Since they achieved major
commercial breakthrough
with the release of ‘Bad
does his ‘Happy’ thing
as opposed to his left
field N.E.R.D. thing. This
really pays off for the
most part with the album
staying consistently lis-
tenable, but never boring
(with the exception of ‘It’s
A Vibe’, which sounds
like one long hook). The
