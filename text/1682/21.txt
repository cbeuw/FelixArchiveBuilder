Worth the hype: L’Antica Pizzeria da Michele
FOOD

P
izza is a food most
students are far
too familiar with.
It’s difficult to
resist such a perfect food
that satisfies all cravings,
particularly when there
seems to be some version
of a pizzeria on every
corner. But it is important
to remember Pizza’s glo-
rious roots – Italy.
For a long time it was
true that no-one could
make a pizza quite like
the Italians; however, it
seems that a number of
ambitious young chefs
were aware of this fact and
actually travelled to Italy
to learn from the great
masters. As a result the
pizza market has changed
dramatically in the past
few years, with the likes
of Pizza Pilgrims and
Franco Manca serving up
Neapolitan-style pizzas in
multiple locations around
London. The success
of such establishments
shows that we will always
hunger for pizza, but the
real question is how they
compare to a true Italian
pizzeria. Fortunately
that is where L’Antica
Pizzeria da Michele steps
in. A direct import from
Naples – the birthplace of
Pizza – l’Antica promises
to bring the best pizza
location has been a local
favourite since opening
in 1870 (!) and recently
amassed a major follow-
ing due to its cameo in the
2010 Julia Roberts film
Eat, Pray, Love. With this
natural publicity, l’Antica
merely had to find a new
location and wait for the
pizza/film lovers to arrive.
And that is precisely what
happened – but is it really
worth the hype?
First Impressions
After trekking all the
way to Stoke Newington
we arrived at a very un-
assuming looking restau-
rant, quietly announcing
its presence with a small
light blue sign. The inside
was also very understated,
with a cafeteria-style
decor rather than a proper
dinner restaurant. The
walls were rather bare and
white, painted with quotes
from Eat, Pray, Love and
Italian sayings. At the
back a large stone pizza
oven was visible, with
chefs bustling around
it, speedily making the
pizzas. A waiter ap-
proached us and we were
told that we would have
to wait 15 minutes for a
table. Bearing in mind that
it was rather early (around
five pm) I was quite sur-
prised that it was already
so busy, but I managed to
contain my hunger and
wait patiently until we
were shown to our table.
We were brought upstairs
to a small room with a
similar vibe to the down-
stairs, although it was less
buzzy.
The Food
The menus stuck to
two classics, Marinara or
Margherita, demonstrat-
ing l’Antica’s attention
to creating something
perfect. I decided to go for
a Margherita. The pizzas
arrived relatively quickly
and were piping hot
with a rich bready smell.
They had a classic Italian
Neapolitan look: slightly
charred basil on top of
a bright red sauce and a
golden crust with flecked
dark spots. I could hardly
hold myself back so I
pulled out a slice and took
a bite. The tart tomato
sauce was the first flavour
that burst into my mouth.
I could really taste the
fresh sweet tomatoes, and
almost felt transported to
a summer’s day in Italy.
The mozzarella was soft
and rich balancing the
soft, warm crust. Overall
it was a real Italian expe-
rience and certainly filled
my pizza craving.
Food writer Bláithín Dockery looks for the best pizza in the world… could it possibly be in Stoke Newington?

Worth the hype?
Sadly no. Although l’Antica Pizzeria da Michele
serves up gorgeous authentic Italian pizzas the hype
surrounding the restaurant was rather exaggerated.
Despite the number of years l’Antica has spent
perfecting their recipes and sourcing the finest
ingredients, the competition for Neapolitian Pizza
is really heating up, so it may be more difficult to
justify travelling to Stoke Newington when there’s
a Franco Manca round the corner!

Felix knows that going
out is the best kind of
celebration, but here are
some (not-so-easy, but
DELICIOUS) recipes
you can enjoy on a lazy
Sunday. If you don’t trust
Marillenknödel
You will need...
• 300 g low fat quark
• 200 g flour
• ~60 g butter (room temperature)
• Vanilla sugar
• 1 egg
• Pinch of salt
• 10 small apricots
• 10 sugar cubes (if you want
them extra-sweet)
• Breadcrumbs
• Butter
• Cinnamon powder
• Icing sugar
1. Mix the room temperature butter with the vanilla sugar and a pinch
of salt until it gets creamy.
2. Stir in the egg, the quark, and the flour until you get a malleable
dough. I know I say it all the time, but you might need to adjust the
quantities a little bit so your dough is not too sticky or too hard.
3. Wrap the dough in film and let it rest for 30 minutes at least – time
to play some games, isn’t it? No!
4. While the dough sits, you should take the stones out of the apricots
and replace them with the sugar cubes – just imagining all the sugar
melting when you start cooking them makes me drool a little bit.
5. On a floured surface, shape the dough into cylinders with a diam-
eter of ~5cm and then cut it into slices. Flatten the slices in your hand,
then place the apricot into the dough, press it around and seal well
– and you will use your first attempt to see exactly how big the next
slices should be. In the end, they should look like dumplings.
6. In a saucepan, bring some water to boil. Place the dumpling in
water and allow to simmer for 10-15 minutes – stir from time to time,
so they don’t stick to one another.
7. In a separate pan, melt the butter. Add the breadcrumbs and cinna-
mon, and fry until golden. Add sugar and stir gently. Turn off the heat
and add the dumpling into the prepared mixture. Roll it around so the
breadcrumb mixturesticks to the dumpling.
8. Finally, dust with icing sugar!
9. P.S. It’s ok if for your first try the dumpling fall apart, but they
shouldn’t. this will happen if the dough was not prepared perfectly!

Kaiserschmarrn
You will need...
• 6 eggs
• 380 mL milk
• 200 g flour
• 3 tbsp granulated sugar
• Raisins
• Vanilla sugar
• Rum
• Lemon rind
• Pinch of salt
• 50 g butter
• Icing sugar
• Cinnamon
1. Separate the eggs and start mixing the yolks. Add the milk, some
vanilla sugar, rum (a bit!) and grated lemon rind – the more, the
better, in my opinion. Mix some more. Once you got a homogenous
composition, add the flour and mix until you get a smooth dough.
2. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites with the granulated sugar
and a pinch of salt until it starts forming firm peaks – this is way
easier with a hand mixer; if you don’t have one, you can try doing
it just with some well-placed manpower, but I cannot imagine you
succeeding. Fold the beaten egg whites into the dough mix – use a
spatula and be patient; if you hurry too much, you will end up ruining
your work.
3. In a pan, let the butter melt and when it starts bubbling, pour
in the dough and after couple minutes, add the raisins over the top.
Even through they are in the original recipe, they are, in my opinion,
optional – but that’s just because I really don’t like them.
4. Cook until the underside is light brown and then turn over with a
spatula and keep cooking until golden brown.
5. Now, time for the really fun part! It’s time to tear it into small
pieces (use your imagination for this, but remember that it’s hot and
you probably still want to use your hands afterwards). When you are
proud with your result, add some granulated sugar on top and cara-
melise under the grill at a high heat.
6. When served, dust with icing sugar and cinnamon. You can eat it
with marmalade, honey, or my favourite, maple syrup with ice-cream
(I know somewhere out there an Austrian has died of shock because
it is normally served with baked plums or fruit compote, but…).
