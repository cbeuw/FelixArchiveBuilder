So, why do people become vegetarian? The logic
behind the lifestyle choice
Ever wondered why your friends are opting out of the midnight chicken nugget run? Wonder no longer - a Felix

A
s a very keen
meat-eater, I
have always
found it hard
to relate to vegetarians.
I grew up as part of a
household who rarely
ate a vegetarian meal.
While eating out, I once
witnessed my sister re-
questing her steak as rare
as the chef can legally
cook it. The smell of burg-
ers at the campus Farmers’
Market almost makes
me drool, causing me to
resent my pre-prepared
salad. Simply put, I don’t
plan on giving up eating
meat anytime soon. The
thought is scary; I would
crave the taste too much.
I am therefore forever
impressed by the people
who manage to make
such a dramatic lifestyle
change and endeavour to
discover why they chose
to. Over time, through
discussions with friends,
I have learned that there
are many diverse reasons
people are/become a veg-
etarian and am constantly
surprised when I uncover
a new one. So, I sent out
a bunch of surveys to
vegetarian friends to quiz
them about their reason-
ing and ask about any
hurdles they faced (or are
perhaps still facing) along
the way. This article is a
summary of the feedback
I received and focuses
on people who chose to
give up eating meat, as
opposed to having been
vegetarians since birth
(usually for religious or
cultural reasons). To the
people I pestered to fill
these out: thanks for being
such good sports – you’re
great.
Environment
The most consistent
reason people became
vegetarian, everyone I
quizzedmentionedit,isthe
environment. Considering
that the vast majority are
Imperial students and thus
likely to be more aware of
environmental issues than
the average person, this
is not entirely surprising
and probably not repre-
sentative of humanity as
a whole. A wish to reduce
their carbon-footprint
by removing animals,
particularly red meat
such as beef, from their
diets, is a major driver.
Animal husbandry uses
far more resources than
“Reducing
their carbon-
footprint by
removing
animals from
their diets is a
major driver”
crop farming, including
energy, land, and water.
In the long term, plant-
based diets are therefore
far more sustainable and
will help reduce the rate
at which the planet is
spiralling into climatic
disaster. Vast energy
usage is unfortunately
a by-product of modern
life, and is in many ways
logistically difficult to cut
down on. However, we do
not need to be wasting so
much energy on food pro-
duction, because animal
husbandry is entirely
avoidable. After all, some
cultures and religions
have been doing it for
millennia.
Health
Others chose to change
their diets due to health
benefits. One person
mentioned that eating
meat simply doesn’t
“agree” with their body
and switching to a plant-
based diet has helped
alleviate their problems.
The omission of meat and
fish from their diets has
forced others to be more
creative and re-structure
their meals around this.
As a result of shaking up
habits, people think about
what they are eating more
and make a conscious
effort to ensure that the
food they are preparing
is nutritionally balanced,
possibly more so than
before they became vege-
tarian. In answer to those
of you who frequently ask
(I have been told) “but
what about protein?”, it’s
actually easier to eat the
recommended amount
than you might think: a
serving of chickpeas for
example, contains almost
half of the protein an
average adult requires
per day. And of course, to
fill themselves up people
often end up munching on
more vegetables, which is
rarely a bad thing health
wise (cheap too)!
Animal Welfare
Some people simply
don’t like killing animals.
The food industry has
tried to increase the
quality of life of livestock
through initiatives such
as “Free Range”, but this
only works to an extent;
they are still being raised
to ultimately satisfy our
desire to eat meat, which
many consider unethical.
There is an argument that
animals eat animals (ex-
cluding herbivores), and
so humans are “natural”
in this regard. However,
we consider ourselves
“superior” to other organ-
isms due to our capacity
to think critically and
have feelings such as
compassion driving our
actions. If this is the case,
then we should be able
to reason with ourselves
and overcome the instinct
to eat meat that many
animals possess, leading
them to hunt and kill other
animals.
Final Thoughts
Initially, the plan for
this article was to explore
some of the reasons why
people choose to be veg-
etarian using information
and opinions from the
surveys I sent out; I am
sure that this topic could
be taken into further
depth and I have merely
skimmed the tip of an
iceberg here. This was
never meant to be a piece
of propaganda designed to
convert meat-eaters into
vegetarians, which is an
ulterior motive that I fear
people may accuse a veg-
etarian writer of having.
However, I have found
some of these arguments
rather compelling and on
reflection I might try and
cut down on my own meat
consumption. I certainly
don’t plan to go cold
turkey (excuse the pun) or
ever completely become
vegetarian for that matter.
But I have been informed
that practising vegetar-
ianism, at least in the
UK, is fairly easy, mainly
due to good substitutes
such as Quorn and Linda
McCartney products (that
apparently some people
prefer), and because lots
of restaurants have a
few vegetarian options
on the menu nowadays.
Personally, I am a fan of
the cheap and easy su-
permarket frozen veggie
burgers, for example
Indian-spiced spinach
and lentil. If eating these
instead of “real” burgers
more often can help slow
down climate change
while simultaneously sus-
taining my bank balance,
then hey, why not?
Don’t these fruit and veg baskets look yummy... Nah? I’d rather have a burger too // Flickr/just1snap
