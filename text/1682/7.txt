The Rocky Balboa of the animal kingdom
C
ompetition and
conflict is the
bread and butter
of the natural
world. Individuals of
almost every species com-
pete for resources such as
mating sites, partners, and
food. The competition is
fierce – often involving
physical conflict with
costly outcomes. Due to its
costs, individuals assess
themselves and their
opponent’s ‘Resource
Holding Potential’ (RHP)
to minimise damage and/
or the need for conflicts.
Mantis shrimps are
known to compete for
burrow sites used for
feeding, mating, breeding
and refuge from preda-
tion. Conflict occurs in
both sexes, using striking
second maxilliped ap-
pendages – regions of the
mouthparts – to deliver
high power strikes, and
stabbing to puncture the
opponents. Furthermore,
Telson sparring – where
individuals strike each
other on their heavily
armoured tail plates – also
occurs.
A recent study exam-
ining conflicts in mantis
shrimps (Neogonodacty-
lus bredini) tried to de-
termine what assessment
models they use when
determining RHP to
choose whether to engage
in a contest for resources.
Three models exist: pure
self-assessment, cumu-
lative assessment and
mutual assessment. Pure
self-assessment involves
an individual assessing
their personal RHP, with
the loser stopping the fight
once self-inflicted costs
reach a critical threshold.
Cumulative assessment
involves an individual
assessing themselves
and their competitor’s
RHP, with the loser
forfeiting once self and
opponent-inflicted costs
(physical injury) reach a
critical threshold. Finally,
in mutual assessment
an individual assesses
both their own and their
opponent’s RHP, with the
loser bowing out when
they realise they are of a
lower competitive ability
than their opponent.
The study involved
placing two individuals,
resident and intruder,
which were matched by
body length and mass,
in an arena containing a
burrow.
was defined as the indi-
vidual that obtained the
burrow after the contest.
Contests between
N. bredini occurs in
escalating stages includ-
ing: eye tracking and
approaching; visual or
chemosensory behaviour;
Telson sparring; and
contest resolution. The re-
searchers discovered that
burrow residency status
– i.e. resident vs intruder
– was as important in
the contest outcome. In
random contests, resident
individuals had a 49.6%
RHP advantage compared
to others, while in body-
type matched contests
residents had only a
9.7% RHP advantage.
Similarly, body mass was
an important determinant
of contest outcome, with
larger individuals able to
produce stronger strikes.
Telson sparring was
used by individuals for
assessment and contest
settling without death or
injury by comparing body
mass and RHP. Based on
these results and through
their analytical methods,
researchers were able
to conclude that mantis
shrimps use the mutual
assessment model, ruling
out the pure self and
cumulative assessment
models.
This study resolves
controversy around the
type of experimental
technique to employ when
researching contests: a
combination of corre-
lational and sequential
analysis is recommended
,ensuring strong empirical
testing that may be used
in future contest studies.

017 was a pecu-
liar year for us
all, with world
politics turned
on its head, as well as
the United States of
America pulling out
of the Paris Climate
Agreement. None of
this seemed to phase the
passionate and dedicated
conservationists work-
ing around the clock to
ensure that their species
of choice would be here
for future generations
to enjoy. To fill you all
with optimism moving
into 2018, here are a few
stories from the past year
which highlight the fact
that we are indeed on the
right track.
One of the most
shocking announce-
ments, which took me
by surprise, was China’s
decision to shut down
the ivory trade within the
country. China put a huge
amount of pressure on
elephants for their ivory
for both medicinal and
decorative purposes. This
ban does not necessarily
may just have a chance to
bounce back!
A recent survey of the
little-known Indus River
dolphin from Pakistan
turned up some very
positive results. Scientists
surveyed the dolphins
over a month-long period,
and now estimate that
there are 1,816 individual
dolphins remaining in
Pakistan. These numbers
are anything but com-
pelling, but it is great
news considering that
when the first census
was completed in 2001,
there were estimated to
be only 1,200 dolphins
remaining. This is a 50%
increase in numbers!
Despite this, the dolphins
are still listed as endan-
gered on the International
Union for Conservation
of Nature Red List due
to the growing threats of
habitat loss, pollution, and
drowning in nets. There
is clearly still a lot to be
done, but conservation
efforts are moving in the
right direction.
A study published in
September analysed the
population trends of the
world’s seven sea turtle
species and showed some-
thing truly amazing. The
numbers of sea turtles as a
whole are growing, which
has further been helped
by years of conservation
efforts that have played a
key role in the recovery
of their population. Sea
turtles have historically
suffered population
declines due to hunting,
accidental capture,
drowning in fishing nets
and the illegal harvesting
of eggs. Again, this is very
encouraging news, but we
cannot grow complacent.
Conservation depends on
the ongoing commitment
and collaboration of
multiple parties to ensure
their hard work is not
undone. You do not have
to be a conservation
biologist to make a
difference: being active
in your local community
with conservation work
can contribute to larger
goals. Maybe in 2019,
when we are looking
back at 2018, a project
you were involved in
will be highlighted.
