The upcoming hair dye revolution
M
y aunt re-
cently dyed
her hair
black, claim-
ing that it would make
her look younger. While
her statement is highly
debatable, it is certain that
fashion consciousness is
on the rise, leading to the
growth of the hair dyeing
industry. However, except
for the chemists amongst
us, people rarely put much
thought into hair dyes.
Why should we?
Firstly, there is much
more science involved
in this industry than
you might imagine!
Permanent dyes work
by coupling precursors
with various molecules,
so the resultant coloured
compounds are trapped in
the hair and are resistant
to shampoo removal. On
the other hand, temporary
dyes simply bond to the
surface of hair fibres, so
they are easily removed
by shampoos.
Whilst I appreciate not
all readers are science
enthusiasts, the newly
generated Hair Dye Sub-
stance Database (HDSD)
is equally fascinating to
all – it has opened the
door to designing greener
and safer hair colourings.
Although hair dyes
are relatively safe, this
multi-billion-pound
industry constantly tries to
improve their products by
screening for chemicals
that may cause allergies.
Some chemicals in hair
dyes have also been
linked to water pollution,
so sustainable and safer
compounds are always
needed. However, the
research and development
process can be lengthy
and expensive, and this
is where the database
developed by the North
Carolina State University
can help.
The HDSD is a publicly
accessible database that
allows scientists to harvest
the power of computers to
minimise the experimental
work required to develop
colour industry. Hence,
the research group in
North Carolina creating
the HDSD via the com-
pilation of 313 hair dye
substances. The past
and current commercial
formulations of these
compounds were curated
and classified according to
their structural and physi-
ochemical characteristics.
By employing an appro-
priate structural-property
model, the HDSD could
help scientists predict
toxicity, or skin sensitivity
of different compounds.
In short, by manipulating
and analysing the large
database of information,
scientists can filter out the
irrelevant molecules early
on, and focus resources
on the more promising
targets. Thereby, the
development of new hair
colouring products can be
faster, cheaper, and more
reproducible.
Nevertheless, there
are limits to this technol-
ogy. The computational
models may not be able to
discriminate strong/weak
sensitizers, and the solvent
interaction cannot yet be
fully simulated, thus the
accuracy of the prediction
is not completely perfect.
Yet, this study showed
cheminformatics analyses
are a promising way for a
new dye design. Further-
more, scientists can start
to modify structures in the
dye precursors to generate
novel hair colourings
with desirable qualities.
If proven successful, a
similar methodology
could be used in designing
other types of dyes too.

n a world where
enormous amounts
of information are
provided nonstop via
24-hour television chan-
nels and digital media, it
should not be surprising
to find that news have a
profound effect on mental
wellbeing. Accounts of
war and extreme poverty
are already concerning for
a significant part of the
general public; however,
all these problems pale
in comparison to climate
change.
Many people cannot
avoid feeling some kind
of existential angst when
they are confronted with
images of starving polar
bears, melting glaciers,
and tiny tropical atolls
being devoured by in-
creasing sea levels. Now,
new research addresses in
detail the different ways
people react to global
warming, exploring the
implications this phenom-
enon has for public policy
in the fight against this
challenge.
The study was carried
out by researchers at the
University of Arizona
using a sample size of
342 individuals. They
classify the environmen-
tally-concerned segment
of the population, as
those who are “aware of
environmental problems
and support efforts to
solve them and/or indicate
a willingness to contribute
personally to the solution”
in three categories:
egoistic, social-altruistic,
and biospheric. Egoistic
individuals focus on the
effects climate change will
have on their own lives;
social-altruistic people
are more concerned
about the impact on the
general society, while
the biospheric segment is
more concerned about the
colossal loss of wildlife
and habitat degradation
that is entailed in a pes-
simistic climate scenario.
Each of the groups both
show different levels of
stress and anxiety, and
express it in different
ways. Therefore, their
psychological coping
strategies and ‘Pro-En-
vironmental Behaviour’
(PEB) show significant
differences.
The group whose
mental health was taking
the biggest toll due to
climate change was the
biospheric portion. They
were more likely to show
symptoms of depression
and stress, and they had
the strongest tendency for
PEB. They were also the
mostpronetousingcoping
mechanisms in order to
reduce their anxiety, e.g.
wishful thinking about the
relative unimportance of
the whole phenomenon.
The social-altruistic
group, while less psy-
chologically affected
by climate change, still
showed some degree of
ecological coping and
PEB. The section of the
population which had
clearly experienced the
lowest levels of anxiety
were the one formed by
egotistic individuals.
The study stressed that
ecological anxiety was not
the only variable behind
PEB, and that positive
ecological coping strate-
gies (e.g. becoming more
aware of one’s role in
stopping climate change
and changing one’s
lifestyle on this premise)
were much more impor-
tant. Thus, the article
recommends addressing
the egotistic segment of
the population in future
messaging campaigns
against climate change,
as “approaches that focus
on concern for all life on
the planet increase the risk
associated with delaying
climate change adapta-
tion, exacerbating the
potential for large-scale
negative mental health
effects in our society”.
E
veryone has
someone in
their life with
an obnoxiously
loud sneeze that he or she
wishes they would at least
try to stifle. As it turns out,
stifling sneezes by pinch-
ing the nose shut with the
mouth closed can actually
be dangerous.
Doctors at the Depart-
ment of Head and Neck
Surgery at the University
Hospitals of Leicester
reported a case of a stifled
sneeze so violent that it
caused spontaneous perfo-
ration of the pharynx – an
area of the back of throat
– leaving its victim barely
able to speak or swallow.
This type of injury is most
often caused by trauma
to the back of the throat,
which indicates that the
forces produced during a
‘held-in’ sneeze can rival
those felt in a blunt trauma
to the neck. The man
suffered from a perfora-
crackling sounds were
heard in the man’s neck
all the way down to his
ribcage. A CT scan further
verified the existence of
air bubbles that had pen-
etrated the muscles of the
chest, otherwise known
as cervical subcutaneous
emphysema. Due to risk
of infection, the man was
admitted to the hospital
where he was tube-fed
due to the pain associated
with swallowing and
administered preventative
antibiotics.
Other than a blunt
trauma to the neck,
spontaneous perforation
of the pharynx is thought
to occur due to a sudden
increase in intraluminal
pressure in the oesophagus
or pharynx. Infrequently
it occurs due to forceful
coughing or retching
and is rarely caused by
holding in a sneeze.
Increased intraluminal
pressure due to pinching
the nose shut and closing
the mouth during sneezing
can also cause rupture of
the eardrum – and rupture
of cerebral aneurysms in
the worst cases! Doctors
warn that sneezing in this
fashion is dangerous and
should not be done. So,
think twice before stifling
that fifth-in-a-row sneeze
or scolding your friend for
a loud sneeze as you just
may find one of you two
in the emergency room.

specifically his pyriform
