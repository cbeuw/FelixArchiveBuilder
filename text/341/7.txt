How to sing and dance your way around the world
and gain 24 units towards a degree in the States.
A n alternative to education on a campus is offered
by the educational corporation 'up with people'. The
idea was started in 1966 by IBlanton Belle, who got
fed up with the misery and depression prevalent
among students and composed of first and second year
students and sixth formers decided to get them up.
His group has gone on from performing around
Michigan to travelling all over the world. There are
now three performing groups. The audience are told
about the scheme during the performance and people
who are interested are interviewed later on. N o basic
skill is necessary to join, but interviewers look for
maturity, flexibility, concern for human kind, interest
in people and ability to endure the tough life ahead.
After one year the students are completely trans-
formed. They manage to pack more adventure into
one week than many would in a year. They also learn
to overcome difficulties and communicate with other
people. About two hundred out of the three hundred
involved in the scheme are 'American.
T w o professors travel with the group giving them
three to ten hours tuition a week in places ranging
from hotel lobbies, ice skating rinks and squares to
cathedrals and palaces. Great use is made of the
changing environment and history is taught literally
on the spot. Units offered are history, English and
speech with dance, music and physical education
available for the keen. 24 units can be picked up,
as opposed to 32 on a university campus. Tuition fee
is $3,000 and pays for a third of the cost, the rest
comes from ticket sales.

there are some 250,000

for advice and education
remains enormous, which
is why the F P A must con-

get the message across by
every possible means avail-
