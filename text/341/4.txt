GRANTS
Conference notes
(1) The total inadequacy of grants
since the interim a w a r d .
(2) T h e accelerating rate of infla-
tion w h i c h is steadily worsen-
ing the e c o n o m i c conditions of
the majority of students.
(3) That the Triennial R e v i e w Pro-
cedure w i l l shortly be in session.
(4) The Meeting for Trade U n i o n -
ists o n the Grants C a m p a i g n
jointly sponsored b y N U S a n d
The London Federation of
Trades C o u n c i l s o n September
27th.
Conference reaffirms
(1) That a central a i m of the Grants
C a m p a i g n must continue to be
to mobilise the w i d e s t numbers
of students in action.
(2) Therefore particular tactics of
the c a m p a i g n — d e m o n s t r a t i o n s ,
meetings, rent strikes, occupa-
tions, etc.. must b e considered
in relationship to that a i m .
(3) That the Whole strategy of sus-
tained a n d escalating mobilisa-
tion agreed to at the Emergency
Conference n o w requires the
largest possible focusing of
anger a n d action around the
actual review procedure itself.
(4) That the decision of the Trade
Union Congress to oppose the
W h i t e Paper strengthen the i m -
portance of N U S laying empha-
sis on the class issue of access
to post school education that
underlies the Grants c l a i m . T h e
support of the organised trade
union a n d labour movement
must accompany the m a x i m u m
mobilisation in action of the
student movement, if w e are to
force a n outcome of the Trien-
nial R e v i e w in accordance w i t h
our d e m a n d s .
Instructions
(1) Exec. & G C C C .
To organise national actions in
England, S c o t l a n d , Northern
Ireland a n d W a l e s to coincide
w i t h prominent meetings of the
Reviewing Body; these actions
to i n c l u d e national demonstra-
tions.
EDUCATION
Conference notes:
1. That in 1 9 7 0 there were 6 7 7 , 0 0 0
students in post-school education
as against a prewar m a x i m u m o f
7 0 . 0 0 0 .
2 That the rapid postwar expansion
in H E has been a c c o m p a n i e d by
state restructurings of H E , i n -
cluding the White Paper o n Edu-
cation.
These h a v e —
(a) Promoted a vocational e m -
phasis in H E as indicated b y
the proposed D i p H E a n d the
expansion of the polytechnic
sector.
(b) Increased the power of cen-
tral government on H E .
(c) Increased B i g Business i n -
vestment, inte est a n d influ-
ence throughout H E .
(d) L e d to a centralisation of
power upon the governing
boards of institutions of H E .
(e) Given the student little or no
say in determining any as-
pect of their education.
Conference recognises:
1. That the content of H E embodies
the values of the ruling
class.
2. That the individuality of study
epitomised in the competitiveness
of the exam system further rein-
forces the divisions between
classes.
3. The struggles w h i c h have taken
place around the issues of educa-
tional policy, e.g.
(a) the d i s m i s s a l of a left w i n g
lecturer at Lancaster.
(b) the sitins at Cambridge.
(c) the alternative seminars at
Sussex.
(d) the alterantive prospectus
at Thames Polytechnic.
RACIALISM
1 Conference notes the increasing
discrimination against Black
people in 'Britain through direct
e c o n o m i c a n d social deprivation
e.g. housing, educational oppor-
tunity; constant police harass-
ment; legislation aimed at keep
ing out black a n d brown i m m i -
grants; the recent Court of Appeal
d e c i s i o n to apply the immigration
act retrospectively.
2. Conference believes that racial-
ism is a product of the imperialist
system a n d serves its interests.
The imperialist p o w e r s seek to
use workers from the newly inde-
pendent states of Africa a n d A s i a ,
employed often in the hardest
and worst paid jobs. Further,
racialism is a tactic to divide the
working class b y providing a
scapegoat for diverting the frus-
tration a n d anger of people from
the capitalist system, on to an
under-privileged a n d easily iden-
tifiable section of the community.
Such a tactic flourishes in an at-
mosphere of unemployment.
3. Conference rejects the concept
That the problem of racialism c a n
be solved by cultural assimilation
of the black community. This
" m e l t i n g pot p h i l o s o p h y " tacitly
places black culture in an inferior
position.
Conference condemns Conserva-
tive a n d Labour Governments for
propagating such racist attitudes
to appease racist groups.
4. Conference, however, notes the
disturbing increases in racist at-
titudes, from w h i c h no group in
society is entirely free. Confer-
ence notes that the activity of
fascist organisations notably the
National Front, h a s increased re-
cently appealing with racist pro-
paganda a n d inciting violence
against black people.
5. Conference believes that students
with other progressive forces, in
particular the trade union move-
ment, have a major responsibility
in stepping up the fight against
racialism a n d racial discrimina-
tion, a n d the development of
fascist organisations.
6. Conference notes the firm stand
taken in the past by N U S a n d
Student Unions against racialism,
especially the activity against the
increase in students' fees in
1967, a n d the resolution on i m -
migration passed at Easter con-
ference 1 9 7 1 .
7 Conference condemns the racial-
ist bias of the education system
in this country, and the lack of
special facilities for immigrants
w h i c h increasingly is a problem
for black school children, w h o ,
rejected by a highly selective
system of education are unjustly
often relegated to E S N establish-
ments. Conference believes that
this is a problem w h i c h particu-
larly deserves the attention of
student teachers.
8. Conference w e l c o m e s the devel-
opment of organisations among
black a n d brown people to coun-
ter increased discrimination a n d
harassment. Conference believes
that the N U S students should
work w i t h such groups, for the
urgent need is to build the unity
of all anti-racialist forces, black
and white.
9. Conference believes that much
more work must be done to
challenge the ideas of racialism
and that c r i t i c i s m of the mass
media for its representation of
racial questions should be under-
taken. C r i t i c i s m of the education
system for a failure to reflect the
history culture a n d achievements
of people from the third world,
and to provide the facilities nec-
essary a n d the training to eqiup
teachers a n d social workers to
deal with the special problems of
immigrant children, is essential.

COMMUNITY
AND EN-
VIRONMENT
Conference notes that as long as to-
day's problems are continually stated
in terms of mass politics a n d mass
organisation it is clear that only i n -
ternational a n d national institutions
can deal with them. Yet, these very
institutions are often tending to ex-
aggerate the capitalist a n d industrial
drive t o w a r d s —
1. centralisation of power and con-
sequent limiting of scope for
local initiatives
2. subjugation of the interests of
mankind as a whole to the inter-
ests of a powerful few
Conference thus asserts that, if an
ecologically sound relationship of
respect between people a n d their en-
vironment is to be realised, then
those without power must be able to
challenge those selective institutions
(such as the education system)
which perpetuate the right of the
powerful few to maintain the present
cycle of exploitation.
Although national a n d local student
unions T A L K about solidarity with
the powerless to achieve these ends.
S C A a n d eco-action groups A C T to-
gether with rang a n d file trade union-
ists, residents, claimants a n d child-
ren in local situations actually chal-
lenging these power relationships.
Such work i n c l u d e s —
(i) urban renewal as a p r i o r i t y —
via action on transport, hous
ing, urban trails, tenants ac
tion, etc.
(ii) the consolidation of the shift
within schools towards en-
vironmental a n d community
action.
(iii) campaigning for more decen-
tralisation of power a n d more
autonomy.
(iv) challenging the vertical hier-
archies of the professional
often based on strict curricu-
lum specialisation.
(v) boycotts a n d education c a m -
paigns by action groups in
support of the interests of the
Third W o r l d .
Two projects were established u n -
der the auspices of N U S in 1971 for a
trial period of three years to wotk
with local c o m m u n i t y ( S C A N U S )
and eco-action ( C O N C E R N U S )
groups. Both projects produce regu-
lar newsletters filled with contribu-
tions from activists round the country,
act as an information exchange, or-
ganise conferences a n d workshops,
produce various publications, a n d
S C A N U S is involved in researching
the developments of alternatives in
higher education.
Each project has two workers w h o
operate as a team; they are in direct
contact with local groups w h i c h en-
ables them to be responsive to the
needs of local activists. S C A N U S has
worked closely w i t h an advisory
group of student activists w h o play
a major part in the running of the
project within the broad policy lines
l a i d d o w n b y N U S national confer-
ence.
Conference rescognises t h a t —
(i) to facilitate local activity it is
essential that this system o f
communication continues to
exist in order to spread infor-
mation arid a i d groups' inter-
action.
(ii) the three year S C A N U S a n d
C O N C E R N U S projects are due
to close in the summer of 1 9 7 4 .
(iii) experience via newsletters, field
visiting, workshops and research
have demonstrated the need a n d
effectiveness of flexible grass-
roots controlled projects.
Conference notes the large num-
bers of students involved in these ac-
tivities and recognises the need to
continue to encourage a n d support
their development.
Conference, acknowledging the
inter-related elements of the 'cycle
of exploitation' outlined above, there-
fore advocates the setting up of a
national Joint Environment a n d C o m -
munity Project to help coordinate
work in these areas.
The following points are necessary
elements in the Joint Environment
and Community Project:
(i) in establishing this joint pro-
ject the N U S should be aware
that they are not organising a
national campaigning unit or
initiating specific projects but
that each Union situation is
unique; in terms of action with-
in the community a n d on en-
vironmental issues only stu-
dents within that Union can
decide what form is suitable.
(ii) N U S Conference should retain
overall control with a n A d v i -
sory Group (see iii) being res-
ponsible for day to d a y affairs.
(iii) the Advisory Group be elected
by an Annual Conference of
activists. N U S Executive mem-
bers w i t h responsibilities for
the Joint Project w i l l be full
members of the Advisory
Group.
(iv) the Joint Project w i l l not have
departmental status within
N U S since this implies mana-
gerial control, w h i c h w o u l d re-
duce responsiveness, flexibili-
ty a n d communications with
the grass-roots a n d w o u l d i n -
hibit the capacity of staff to re-
act to local needs via field
visits, etc.
(v) at least four full-time staff are
required w o r k i n g o n a n equal
basis with equal pay a n d their
appointment a n d dismissal
shall be the responsibility of
the Advisory Group.
(vi) the nature of the work will be
the maintenance of a c o m m u n i -
cations system between groups
as outlined earlier based on
visits, workshops, newsletter
and should remain responsive
to the changing needs of
groups.
(vii) some differences will exist i n
the emphasis of future w o r k —
such as the information base
and scale of i s s u e s — a n d this
will require that the staff of
the Joint Project retain some
separate functions.
EUROPEAN
PEACE AND
SECURITY
N U S Conference notes that the
major trend in European affairs is
that of detente. Conference specifi-
cally notes the treaties signed be-
tween the Soviet Union a n d the
Federal Republic of Germany, Poland,
and the F R G a n d the German Demo-
cratic Republic a n d the F R G ; The
1971 four power agreement on Ber-
lin; the 1 9 7 3 bilateral agreement be-
tween the U S A a n d the U S S R ; the
growing international recognition of
the G D R ; the partial success of the
Helsinki S A L T talks and the recently
held talks marking the opening stages
of the European Security Conference.
Conference further notes the in-
creased possibilities of international
contacts arising from the successful
participation of over 4 0 0 delegates
in the 10th W o r l d Festival of Youth,
and the united opposition of import-
ant Scottish local authorities, labour
movement a n d students to the pre-
sence of nuclear bases in the W e s t of
Scotland, expressed in the 1973 CNf>
Easter march.
Conference w e l c o m e s the growing
demand that Britain should leave the
E E C a n d that a future Labour Govern-
ment should implement this.
In the meantime, in the interests o f
its membership the N U S Conference
instructs the Executive to collaborate
fully with other student unions of
W e s t Europe, the International U n i o n
of Students a n d relevant organisa-
tions of the labour movement in order
jointly to protect student interests in
respect of educational reforms a n d
the transferability of professional
qualifications; a n d to report to
Easter Conference 1974 on the same.
A s a first year student in the
M a t h e m a t i c s Department last
year I took a n active part i n
the organisation of s o c i a l
events for my year a n d w a s
elected S o c i a l R e p . C o n s e -
quently I still hold a strong be-
lief that the s o c i a l life of the
department is sadly l a c k i n g
a n d a m always l o o k i n g to
those in posts of responsibility
to improve it.
Y o u may imagine h o w out-
raged I w a s to hear that b y
Sunday, 7th O c t o b e r 1973
there are only six students,
including Freshers, attending
the F r e s h e r s ' Dinner. Unfor-
tunately the n u m b e r s have to
be in to M r . M o o n e y by Tues-
day. It is the j o b of the De-
partment Rep. to p e r s u a d e stu-
dents to c o m e along to the
Dinner a n d a s we have reach-
ed this sorry state of affairs,
one must a s k whether the
present Department R e p . is
really interested in the social
life of o u r department or d i d
he just stand for a seat o n
C o u n c i l for S o c . S o c . I await
his reply with anticipation.
Having attacked my Depart-
ment R e p . in this fashion I a m
b o u n d to be a s k e d w h y I d i d
not stand for election. The
answer to this is quite simple,
I feel that I c a n help students
enjoy c o l l e g e life more a s
Ents. C h a i r m a n of R C S U than
I c o u l d have a s Maths. Depart-
ment R e p .
The readers of Felix w h o
feel c o n c e r n e d on reading this
letter that a vast majority of
Freshers will miss out o n the
biggest s o c i a l event of their
year c a n rest a s s u r e d that
something will be done. A l -
though there is only o n e d a y
left to persuade Freshers to
c o m e along, a group of u s w h o
feel outraged by the results of
our Department Reps, work
will d o all in o u r p o w e r to per-
s u a d e people to c o m e along.
Y o u r s sincerely,
