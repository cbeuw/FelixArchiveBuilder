Letter to the Editor
S i r ,
O n behalf of the
Royal School of
Mines Union, may I
compliment you on
having the first 'Felix'
of the term (Issue N o .
340), delivered on
time to the Imperial
College Union Office,
and no further. This
alone represents a tre-
mendous amount of
work on your part.
f i l m R e v i e w
T h i s firm w a s direct-
e d by Costa-Gavras, one
of the few d i r e c t o r s w h o
m a k e strongly political
films. T h e s c e n e w a s
set in a S o u t h A m e r i c a n
country, w h i c h remain-
e d a n o n y m o u s through-
out a n d c l a i m e d t o re-
late a true story. It w a s
about a n e p i s o d e i n t h e
fife of t h e T u p a m a r o s
guerrillas o r " u n m e n -
t i o n a b l e s " a s they a r e
c a l l e d a s their n a m e i s
b a n n e d .
In a very smooth
operation they k i d n a p
the B r a z i l i a n C o n s u l , a n
A m e r i c a n E m b a s s y
attache a n d a n o t h e r
A m e r i c a n c a l l e d Philip
M i c h a e l Santere. In bul-
letins, w h i c h they regu-
larly b r o a d c a s t , they
d e m a n d that political
prisoners, h e l d b y t h e
government, s h o u l d b e
released in e x c h a n g e
for t h e k i d n a p victims.
T h e government, of
c o u r s e , d e n i e s that it
h a s any political prison-
ers, only c o m m o n cri-
minals, a n d refuses to
negotiate. Instead, it
o r d e r s a t h o r o u g h
s e a r c h for t h e m i s s i n g
men a n d at o n e time
they c o m e very c l o s e to
b e i n g f o u n d b u t for t h e
i n c o m p e t e n c e of t h e
p o l i c e .
In the meantime t h e
guerrillas interrogate
their captives. T h e rea-
son for t h e k i d n a p p i n g
of Santere i s a mystery
to the press a s officially
he is a m e m b e r of
A.I.D. (Agency for Inter-
national i j e v e i o p m e n t )
a d v i s i n g o n traffic a n d
c o m m u n i c a t i o n s . It s o o n
b e c o m e s apparent that
he i s nothing of the sort
but i s really there to
work c l o s e l y with t h e
army a n d secret police.
The guerrillas c l a i m that
the government i s cor-
rupt a n d in e s t a b l i s h i n g
its e n d s u s e s torture de-
v i c e s ( s o m e rather
horrific s c e n e s a r e
s h o w n ) a n d c o m p l e t e l y

that S a n t e r e a i d e d t h e m
a n d other Latin A m e r i -
c a n c o u n t r i e s to estab-
lish right w i n g views.
H e turns o u t to b e a
c o m p l e t e o p p r e s s o r of
any form of l i b e r a l i s m
a n d c o m m u n i s m .
T h e tension in t h e
film i n c r e a s e s a s t h e
g o v e r n m e n t refuses to
y i e l d to t h e terrorists'
d e m a n d s a n d it even
c o n s i d e r s resigning. O n
the w h o l e t h e film ex-
p r e s s e s t h e situation i n
S o u t h A m e r i c a very
well. It w a s shot, with
m u c h o p p o s i t i o n , in
C h i l e but t h e m a k e r s
strongly deny that t h e
events in it have any-
thing to d o with C h i l e .
Even s o it is worth not-
ing that i n 1970 a for-
mer A m e r i c a n p o l i c e
chief, M r . D a n Mitrioni,
w a s k i d n a p p e d , with
two others, a n d , later
killed in C h i l e . T h e film
portrays t h e situation
from the guerrillas'
point of view a n d does
so very w e l l . They s a y
that they are fighting for
liberalism a n d demo-
c r a c y a n d a r e s h o w n to
be c o m p a s s i o n a t e , well-
o r g a n i s e d p e o p l e w h o
genuinely regret to have
to g o to s u c h e x t r e m e s
to m a k e t h e m s e l v e s
heard. E x c e l l e n t direc-
tion m a k e s this very
clear a n d it i s a film
well worth seeing.

Yves Montand arrives at Police headquarters in 'State o f S i e g e '
A l l eight pages
have been filled, W e
find the two page
article on 'Felix goes
to press' most in-
teresting, and the two-
page Diary, with its
large daily squares,
most useful. Spoil is
mentioned; but the
standard articles by
the Union Officers
still leave s o m e
column-inches to be
filled.
What superhuman
efforts you must have
expended i n collect-
ing articles on such
far-flung topics, and
with s u c h wide
appeal.
Unfortunately your
heavy workload has
obviously been re-
sponsible for the
gross libel that you
have printed on Page
2 of this issue. I refer,
of course, to the
a r t i c l e n e a t l y
crammed into the top
of columns 3-6; and
more specifically to
the 3rd paragraph of
'Imperial C o l l e g e
Publications'.
The Royal School
of Mines Union ob-
jects most strongly to
the following lies, as
printed and circu-
lated in Felix under
your auspices as
editor.
1. T h a t Mines-
letter is 'defunct'.
2. That the mem-
bers of our Union
doing research are
both 'geriatric', and
few in number.
3. That some mem-
bers of our Linion
are doing deferred
honours.
4. That 'rumour'
has it that Minesletter
is more blue in con-
tent and politics than
Guildsheet.
To substantiate our
objections we would
like to bring to your
notice the following
points.
1. Minesletter has
been published fre-
quently. The most re-
cent dates being,
24.5.73, 1.10.73. Last
year a total of eight
editions were pub-
lished.
2. Applications for
research posts are
most carefully con-
sidered, and i n com-
mon with any institu-
tion that is proud of
its name and reputa-
tion, o n l y post-
graduates of t h e
highest calibre are ad-
mitted. B y no means
can 223 postgradu-
ates be considered
few in number.
3. There are no
members of our
Union taking de-
ferred honours in this
academic year.
â€¢ 4. The publication
of any rumour is bad
ethics, and concealing
the source of a
rumour is a most de-
spicable practice.
On behalf of the
Royal School of
Mines Union, I would
ask you to publish
this letter 'in toto' in
the next edition of
Felix. This action on
your behalf would be
considered a formal
apology and the mat-
ter dropped.
P A U L G E E
Editor's
reply:- j
I w e l c o m e your let-
ter a n d print it not a s a
formal a p o l o g y but in
order to reply to the
points raised.
I shall not attempt to
a n s w e r y o u point b y
point but I s h o u l d like
to point out that the
majority of my 'work-
l o a d ' a s y o u put it is
unfortunately not at pre-
sent spent c o l l e c t i n g
articles but rather hunt-
ing, b e g g i n g a n d cajol-
ing adverts without
w h i c h Felix w o u l d n ' t
even exist.
Fair e n o u g h , y o u
might say, b u t what is
the point of p r o d u c i n g
a p a p e r w h i c h is finan-
cially viable b u t irrele-
vant to students. Right,
a n d s o d o i n g the
g r o u n d w o r k that I a m
at present o n advertis-
ing s h o u l d enable m e to
s p e n d less time o n t h e
t e l e p h o n e a n d more
time r e s e a r c h i n g arti-
cles. Nonetheless I
a p p e a l to a l l students
to write for Felix a s I
a m sure that the last
thing that is wanted is
an issue written b y m e .
T o move o n t o t h e
' g r o s s libels'. I apolo-
gise for stating that
Minesletter is defunct in
the s e n s e of n o longer
b e i n g published- T h e
references implying that
only long-standing mem-
bers of the C o l l e g e
c o u l d r e m e m b e r the
last i s s u e of Mineslet-
ter is, a s y o u have
pointed out factually in-
correct. It w a s by no
m e a n s meant to refer
solely to p e o p l e in the
R . S . M . U . but to students
in general.
T h e s o u r c e s of t h e
'rumour' w e r e many
c o n v e r s a t i o n s with stu-
dents a n d a s s u c h a p -
p e a r e d to b e t h e feel-
ing of a section of the
student body. Rather
than state it a s s u c h I
c a l l e d it, p e r h a p s with
a d e g r e e of s e m a n t i c
lassitude, a 'rumour'.
I note that y o u take
no e x c e p t i o n to the
content of the statement
about t h e subject of
Minesletter but instead
focus your c r i t i c i s m
onto t h e form of that
statement.
I c o n c l u d e that y o u
regard t h e statement is
correct a n d I h o p e that
you will remedy the
situation.
