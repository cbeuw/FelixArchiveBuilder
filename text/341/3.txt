BRISTOL STUDENTS SURVEY THEIR
LIVING STANDARDS
THE
BENEVOLENT
ARM OF
THE LAW
A Survey o n student living
costs, prepared b y students o f
the University o f Bristol
U n i o n , m a y become a n i m -
portant document i n the nego-
tiations about student grants
now going o n between the
Department o f E d u c a t i o n a n d
Science and the National
U n i o n of Students.
T h e Survey, which has
been called " a careful piece
of w o r k " by M r . N o r m a n St.
John-Stcvas, claims that stud-
ent grants are £57 a year be-
low basic living expenses. T h e
situation for medical students
is even worse; the Survey
estimates that they are £2.40
a week below the level they
should be.
T h e Survey was presented
to I he University o f Bristol
C o u n c i l in July. A s a result
the C o u n c i l , which has a
majority o f laymen, including
top businessmen and local
authority representatives, ask-
ed Bristol's Vice-Chancellor,
D r . A . W . M c r r i s i o n , to write
to the Department o f E d u c a -
tion and Science expressing
the Council's concern about
the student grant situation
highlighted b y the Survey's
findings. T h e Bristol letter
asked the D E S to consider i n
particular t h e following
points:
t. that the main grant
should be settled at a
realistic level
2. that there should be pro-
per arrangements for
combating inflation
3. that the parental c o n -
tribution system should
be abolished
4. that the principle o f
smaller grants f o r mar-
ried women students
was wrong, and
5. that special cases, such
as medical a n d dental
students, w h o work a 48
week year, deserved
special treatment.
M r . N o r m a n St. John-
Stcvas, for the D E S , has re-
plied that he agrees with the
C o u n c i l that grants should be
adequate to meet the essen-
tial costs o f attendance at
academic courses. H e refuses
to make a n y promises about
arrangements to combat i n -
flation. H e estimated that the
abolition o f the parental con-
tribution would cost £4m per
a n n u m . H e has undertaken to
IC NUPE OUT
ON STRIKE
Over the last few months
w e have seen mounting at-
tacks b y police o n working-
class communities. T h e
'police, under the pretext o f
the b o m b hysteria a n d anti-
Irish demagogy, last week
raided houses in Prince o f
W a l e s Crescent, Charrington
Street, H a r w o o d Street, Bas-
set Street, G i l d e n Road a n d
Piatt Street. T w o - h u n d r e d
a n d fifty police were involved
in the raids, several were
a r m e d , s o m e carried sledge-
hammers, which they used
to s m a s h d o w n doors a n d
break windows.
SEARCH FOR B O M B S
Each of the streets was
"first cordoned off by police
coaches so no one could get
!
ih or out. T h e police entered
:
the houses whether locked
or otherwise, smashing down
floors, climbing through
w i n d o w s a n d over rooftops.
M e n a n d women were forced
from their beds, interrogated
while dressing a n d watched
while their possessions were
thrown around the room as
police searched for explo-
sives. However n o arms or
b o m b factories were un-
earthed. Nevertheless 3 0
people were arrested o n Fri-
day morning on various petty
charges. None were charged
in connection with the bomb-
ings.
LAW O F F SIDE'
Over the last week or two
there has been a series o f
indescriminate raids on vari-
ous squatting communities
by the police. T h e House of
Lords ruling making c o n -
spiracy to trespass a criminal
offence makes it very clear
that neither the law nor the
police are on the side of
squatters.
FAIR RENT A C T
This spells out grave dan-
ger for tenants — today
squatters a r e in the front
line of attack in the broad
housing movement; tomorrow
the law a n d the police will
be used against the private
and council tenant. Already
the 'fair rent a c t ' is seen
clearly to be opposed to ten-
ants interests.
POLICE RAIDS
T h e s e police raids have
been carried out in various
communities a n d o n o n e or
two political organisations
(i.e. Workers Fight head-
quarters — a radical left-
wing group) over the last
couple o f weeks, represent
an increasing use o f the
police to harass a n d terror-
ise the community.
P O L I C E A T T A C K S
T h e s e attacks and harrass-
ment o f left-wing oragnisa-
tions by the police signify
the 'bringing h o m e ' of the
struggle in Ireland. N o longer
will the struggle be c o n -
tained o n the territory o f the
oppressed but it is now being
carried back to t h e country
of the oppressor. Under the
smokescreen of the bombings
the police a n d the state
machine are having their
powers strengthened; already
having chosen various " h i p p y
c o m m u n i t i e s " as the mass
media put it to practise
manoeuvres before the full
force o f the state machine is
turned against the organised
working class. T o send in
2 5 0 police a r m e d , carrying
hatchets, walkie talkie, dogs,
setting up road blocks, cor-
doning off streets, isolating
whole areas under the pre-
text of looking for the bomb-
ers c a n only be seen in the
light o f a military dress re-
hearsal by the state.
POLICE ESCORTS
In the last year the police
have been used more a n d
more directly against work-
ers interests. In particular
they have c o m m o n l y escorted
strike breakers across picket
lines in industrial disputes.
T h e law being used against
the Shrewsbury building
workers is being interpreted
so that the tactic of the mass
picket c a n be outlawed. T h e
use of the immigration laws
to increase divisions between
black and white workers, the
pay laws, the Industrial Re-
lations A c t all represent a
strengthening of the state's
legal armoury against work-
ing people.
DEFEND LIBERTIES
It is becoming increasing-
ly clear for the need to or-
ganise to defend what basic
liberties w e have.

T r e v o r Locke, Director o f
the Survey, and now President
of the Bristol Students' U n i o n
said: " W e think o u r findings
are important. T h e D E S is in
the dark about the t r u e situ-
ation. T h e i r statistics tend to
bo two years out o f date. T h i s
Survey is the most up-to-date
and it covers an area which
has not been looked at before.
W e wish to emphasise, f o r
those looking for a national
significance, that Bristol U n i -
versity has a higher percent-
age o f students coming from
well-to-do backgrounds than
most. T h e situation at other
universities is likely to be
m u c h worse than at Bristol.
Therefore, the most signifi-
cant results to come from o u r
work w i l l be those w h e r e
financial disadvantage c a n
be proved; i f h a r d s h i p exists
here one c a n be reasonably
s u r e t h a t i t is far worse i n
m a n y o t h e r u n i v e r s i t i e s . "

T h e m a i n conclusions and
results o f the Survey a r c :
a) T h a t the level o f grants
is just adequate for
term-time expenditure,
bat does not allow for
necessary costs during
vacations.
b) T h a t , as a result o f this,

m a t e s o f vacation e x -

the survey are not r e -

should be, a n d are thus
i i n d i n g it even harder to
manage tinaucially.
C l i n i c a l medical students
work a 48 week academic
year, and receive a grant o f
£596.20: this compares w i t h
£712 that would be received
if the usual 30 week grant o f
£445 were extrapolated at the
same level. T h i s means that
these s t u d e n t s receive £2.40
p e r w e e k less than students
i n other f a c u l t i e s throughout
t h e i r working year. I n a d d i -
t i o n t o this, they have little
o p p o r t u n i t y to earn other
