What a n earth-shattering introduction for
freshers t h e last U G M w a s . Here w e a r e
b a c k at IC after o n e of the most momentous
summer vacations for ages: where a fascist
dictatorship h a s been installed in Chile after
a bloody military coup, black South Africans
m o w n d o w n a t Western Deeps, a gold mine
with s u b machine guns, price rises in this
country o f a scale reminiscent o f W e i m a r
type inflation, bombs exploded by mysterious
bombers all round the country a n d industrial
action o n the cards this winter, o f the sort
that c o d d topple governments.
But what d o w e find at the U G M ? Just
ICU pledging itself again to follow the line
of the N U S with regard to the grants c a m -
paign.
W h a t have w e w o n out o f last year's mass
mobilisation o f 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 students at its peak
around t h e 4 basic N U S d e m a n d s ? — A
1 0 % grant C U T d u e t o rising prices a n d no
advance o n the demands.
N o surprise is it that the Stalinists here
at IC feel that students will b e difficult to
mobilise this term, after a'l that resulted in
nothing.
T h e y ' r e talking o f course of mobilisation
around their leadership — that politically
bankrupt farce o f Steve Parry, J u d y Cotter,
Stuart Paul a n d their fellow travellers like
N U S President J o h n Randall.
T h e same kind o f leadership a s shown b y
Oigby J a c k s , last year's N U S President, who
was reduced to silence at King's, last T h u r s -
day, when challenged over the questions of
Chile a n d the role o f the Popular Front.
T h e problems that students face today are
not isolated from the rest o f society. T h e y
pay the same rising prices, live in the same
(if not worse) a c c o m m o d a t i o n at exhorbi-
tant rents a n d have the s a m e future o f 1 1 1
per cent mortgages, closure o f industry a n d
Weimar inflation a s everyone else.
Single-issue protest politics is d e a d in this
situation. T o try to force t h e Tories to
a c c e d e to our really minimal d e m a n d s by a
campaign leading u p t o a session at t h e
bargaining table is nothing short o f blatant
treachery. O n a l l other fronts t h e Tories
have burnt the bargaining tables a n d where
they stood, placed a n armed policeman from
the Special Patrol Group.
T h e working class isn't going to sit back
and have its Democratic rights a n d living
standards s m a s h e d b y t h e Tories, in a n
effort to save their vanishing profits in this
period o f rapidly deepening w o r l d w i d e e c o -
nomic crisis.
That is only if the fight is taken up within
the trade unions to remove their leadership
of labour lefts, right wingers a n d Stalinists.
T h e y preach that the w a y t o fight against
these attacks b y t h e T o r i e s is a Popular
Front pledged t o socialism b y reform.
" T h e peaceful road t o s o c i a l i s m " , they
call it. But what w e learnt from Chile is
that the s o called peaceful road to s o c i a l i s m
is the bloody road t o f a s c i s m .
T h e s e English A l l e n d e s are not misguided
individuals, they a r e consciously working
against the interests of the working class in
order t o retain their privileged positions in
their respective beaurocracies.
Not that A l l e n d e h a d a suicide wish, it's
just that his whole role a n d position c a m e
from h i s political standpoint, w h i c h w a s
the peaceful road o f the Stalinists.
T h e present leaders o f the grants c a m -
paign at N U S are o f the s a m e political kind
and are leading us up t h e same garden
path to betrayal.
S o what d o w e d o ? Leave our future i n
the hands o f these charlatans a n d class
collaborators or build a principled trader-
ship within N U S that will fight for our rights
and living standards.

Whose
responsibility?
As a graduate w h o has been trained for probation work, they could
be yours. You have learned t o think straight, to distinguish cause
from effect. That ability and a practical approach to problems, are
now more important in o u r w o r k than ever. For the Probation and
After-Care Service is a principal agent in the Government's aim t o
extend the range of workable alternatives to prison. Some form of
community service, day training centres and intensive
supervision—such are the kinds of alternative treatment that
the Home Office is sponsoring. A n d Probation Officers are
going to carry them out. That is why anyone coming into the
service at this time must be flexible in approach; eager to
apply new techniques; and willing to experiment.
The way you enter is normally through a-course of professional training
recognised by the Central Council for Education and Training in Social W o r k
and leading to the Council's Certificate of Qualifications in Social W o r k .
Courses last between one and two years, depending on your degree.
During training a salary of at least £1,416 is paid. After training, a Probation
Officer's salary starts at £1,803 and rises in all cases to not less than £2,232.
Officers have the opportunity to reach a higher maximum of £2,661.
Promotion to Senior Probation Officer would bring it up to £3,216; further
promotion could bring up to £6,000 according to the probation area. (Increases
in these scales are currently being negotiated). All Officers working in the
London area receive additional remuneration.
For more information about this demanding and fulfilling career, please send
your name and address on a postcard to The Home Office, Probation and
After-Care Department ( ), Room 446, Marsham Street, London,
S W I P 3DY, or get in touch with your local Principal Probation Officer whose
address and telephone number are in the telephone book.
