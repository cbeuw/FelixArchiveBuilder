FELIX FELIX, Friday February 6th 1987 6
All clubs take notice
Lesbian and gay
welfare
A f e w s update
In case you didn't know, the acting
L/G Welfare Officer is Robert
Daniel. He can be reached in total
confidence, at IC Union Office by
internal mail and is ready to discuss
anything.
Lesbian/Gay Society
It will take quite a while to formally
establish this kind of society.
In the meantime Robert proposes
that all IC Lesbians/Gays meet at the
ULU Lesbian and Gay Societies
which meet every Thursday at
7.30pm at the ULU building on Malet
Street (follow poster once inside—
the atmosphere is very friendly).
Questionnaire
Please fill in Q23 (Sexuality)
honestly—this will help us decide
what type of services are needed at
IC.
Finally
Listen out for the IC Radio
interview with Robert—sometime this
Friday or next week.
All these notice boards have been
reassigned due to the appearance of
new clubs and disappearance of older
ones. The letter asking for
applications for a noticeboard went
out on January 9th 1987. Each club
and society had a letter sent to them
from me via their pigeon hole. The
letter stated categorically that
anybody who doesn't hand in an
application for board space will not
be considered for a space. Current
ownership or traditional sports are not
excuses for owning a space.
Anybody who hasn't applied and
therefore hasn't been allocated a
noticeboard, will have to vacate their
old space, or if they've never had a
space that's alright. Please don't come
whinging to me, as I feel 22 days
notice is adequate, and besides you
will not get sympathy.
These club spaces are there to
enable clubs to pass club news to
members; mass advertising of events
is not restricted to these boards alone,
so the traditional publicity ploys still
hold. Anybody who does use a board
that is not theirs will be deemed to
have broken publicity rules.
Yours,
Dave Colley, Hon Sec.

What does she do all day?
Or, the first in a series of sabbatical job
descriptions, scheduled to coincide with the run up
to the ICU elections later this term. Here Christine
Taig outlines her job as Union President.
It was around this time last year that
I started seeing blinding flashes of
lightning and hearing voices from the
clouds saying "Go on Christine, why
not?" Actually, that's not entirely
true—it was my flatmate who
persuaded me to stand for ICU
President (and we're still friends!)
Well, the year's gone by at immense
speed and now Dave Jones is hassling
me to write something about my job
"as we all become gripped by election
fever." So for all of you with roaring
temperatures, here goes...
There's a job description for the
President in the Union By-laws. It's
very short. Don't be fooled...You
could, of course, do very little in this
job as in any other, but if you take
it at all seriously it involves long
hours and hard work. Being an
engineer was never like this; it is a
job, not a "year off." My only bit
of advice is this—if anyone is thinking
of standing for President—or ANY
sabbatical post—in order to gain
power/a good CV/lots of
"freebies"—forget it now.
Back to the job description. The
President has overall responsibility
for everything the Union does. This
doesn't mean that the whole thing
runs on one ego—in a good year the
sabbaticals work very much as a team
and share decisions and duties. We
also get wonderful permanent staff
without whom the Union would fall
apart; there's very little sense of
'hierarchy' in the Union structure.
However, it ultimately falls to the
President to ensure that Union policy
is carried out and coordinate the work
of staff, sabbatical and other officers
and the various Union committees.
The President also presents the
public face of the students of IC (just
hope I don't look as bad as my photos,
then)—representing your interests to
College and the rest of the known
Universe, if anyone's interested.
This all means an awful lot of time
in committees—most of which do
make decisions affecting all students,
however tedious they may appear;
vast amounts of listening to people's
ideas, criticisms and problems; lots
of time hassling or cajoling people
into getting things done. As for the
"freebies"—these are usually not the
wild parties everyone assumes they
are but more of an exercise in talking
shop and sounding people out.
It's impossible to predict what a
week as President will be like (apart
from Freshers week which is
ludicrous, sleepless, chaos) as you
have to respond to situations as they
arise. Your diary is usually pretty full
a week in advance and there are
constant streams of phone calls,
letters and visits from people wanting
information, advice or help. Finding
time to write monthly reports for
Council or UGM's or weekly drivel
for FELIX is not always easy.
So, is the life of a sabbatical a
happy one?? Yes—as long as you
don't expect too much sleep, don't
expect major changes to happen
overnight, don't mind doing the hard
work yourself when nobody else
bothers, and above all get used to
people telling you the Union's a waste
of time and that you don't do anything
worthwhile. Apart from that you have
a fairly amazing time, encounter some
brilliant people and strange situations,
and gain a lot of experience to boot.
Maybe I should go into marketing
after this...
