A young unmarried woman tries to
conceal her pregnancy and gives birth
to a stillborn child. Later the body of
a newly born baby is found stabbed
to death on a nearby beach. The
woman is accused of its murder, and
despite the incompatibility of blood
groups, the discovery of the body of
her baby in the field where she buried
it and the complete lack of any
substantial evidence, charges are
pressed, following the mistreatment
of the woman whilst in police
custody.
This is not fiction, it is the Kessy
Baby Case in Ireland in 1984. The
story of Joanne Hayes was not a
murder hunt, it was an investigation
into the morality of a country where
pre-marital sex and contraception are
banned. Joanne Hayes was a naive
scapegoat.
Fallen at the Drill Hall Arts Centre
is a one-woman show (by Polly
Teale), retelling the story from
Hayes' point of view. Consequently
it deals more with her upbringing, the
affair with a married man that led to
the pregnancy, and life in rural
Ireland than it does with the
international storm of protest against
the Irish State that exploded when
news of the case broke.
Carole Pluckrose is superb as the
confused Joanne. Julia Bardsley's
production deals well with this
controversial story. It is one of those
stories that would have been
dismissed as inconceivable had it been
written as a piece of fiction. I greatly
recommend you see it before it closes
on February 14th.

Journey among
the dead
The title is a perfect summary of the
play: an autobiographical account of
the central character's life. It is set in
Jean's mind in the past, present and
future and one never knows what is
real, allegorical or fantasy, for
example Jean witnesses a
conversation between himself and his
father which they never actually
had—but should have. Jean condemns
or praises all that he has done, is
plagued by indecision, feels guilt and
shows great selfishness.
The play becomes more unnatural
and surreal as it progresses. Jean
becomes unable to distinguish
between his mother, grandmother and
all the other people he has hated and
stripped of their pride. Towards the
end we discover the reason for Jean's
frustration—he is unable to find 'the
final truth'. The whole play climaxes
with Jean's harrowing confession of
his innermost secrets.
Most of the acting is good, the
naturalistic way in which Jean is!
portrayed contrasts well with the
caricatures of the rest of the cast.
There is a lot to take in at one sitting
but something with which everyone
can identify in Journeys Among the
Dead. I did not understand all of the
play. I would have to find out more
about its writer, Eugene Ionesco, to
do that, but I was left with a need to
do this, which I suppose is one of the
marks of a good play.

Penny for a song
The Royal Shakespeare Company will
be showing, until the 7th March, a
production of " A Penny for a Song,''
by John Whiting at the Barbican
Theatre. It is probably the most
popular of Whiting's plays, and, in
my opinion, one of the best.
The production was visually
superb, with a beautiful set, fully
worthy of the high standard expected
of the RSC.
It is the story of a group of
colourful eccentrics, all of whom have
their own contrasting characters. An
example of this is, in his own eyes at
least, the hero of the play, "Sir
Timothy Bellboys.'' the owner of the
house and garden where the play is
set. The play revolves around his
attempt to defeat Napoleon and his
seventy-five thousand troops single
handed. His master plan will not be
revealed here, but includes his
disappearance down a well and his
subsequent spectacular reappearance
in a large red hot air balloon, less than
triumphant.
" A Penny for a Song" has all the
ingredients of a good comic farce, and
takes advantage of them with
maximum effect. By going to see this
play you will have the chance of
seeing one of the world's finest
dramatic groups putting on a
performance of what is, to me, an
excellent comedy. In short, I would
recommend anyone to see this
production if at all possible—a very
funny play, well produced—all in all
a highly enjoyable night out.

The keep
Four years after its release in
America, The Keep comes to London.
Its reception in the US, which can
only be described as lukewarm to
tepid, may well have been a
contributing factor to its late release
here.
Scripted and directed by Michael
Mann, (Starsky and Hutch, Miami
Vice), The Keep is very loosely based
on the idea of a fable, set in World
War II. The film centers around an
old 'Keep' in the Carpathian Alps,
which the Germans take over as a
stronghold. Ignoring the advice of the
locals to leave, they stay and sure
enough release the monster, Radu
Molasar, a seven foot 'being', and the
corpses follow with alarming
regularity.
The bodies left scattered around
causes the Nazi head command to
bring in the SS-man Kaempffer
(Gabriel Byrne) to take over from
Capt. Woermann. Woermann,
wonderfully portrayed by Jurgen
Prochnow, is a kind, gentle character,
Cop's Honour, a french film starring
Alain Delon, is the story of one man's
revenge against the killings of his wife
and daughter. It is also extremely
funny.
The worrying thing is, however,
that it is meant to be deadly serious
with a few obvious jokes here and
there; I found it hysterical,
interspersed with gory bits now and
again. Perhaps the overall impression
of the film is aptly summed up by the
fact that the hero goes by the name
of Daniel Pratt. It seems as though the
makers of the film have taken all the
standard ingredients of police films,
mashed them altogether and put the
result in the oven at too low a
temperature.
The rugged hero; the simple, easy-
to-follow plot; the token
policewoman—pretty, but not quite as
good at her job as her male
counterparts—they all lacked a certain
je ne sais quoi (sorry!)
Even the obligatory car chase was
sadly lacking in credibility—Renaults
belting round the back streets of Lyon
somehow can't compete with the
American version. Still, there is
plenty of blood and guts to fill the
void—not a film for the squeamish.
Delon manages to survive the film
by amazing luck and some pretty
unbelievable physical acrobatics, but
at the end one is left with a feeling
of having been somewhat cheated, as
the rest of the cast is either dead or
maimed.
By the time the story-line seems to
be improving and one thinks that
maybe the script writer did have an
imagination, it's too late. The credits
begin to roll accompanied by the
dreadful theme tune sung in heavy
"alio-'alio' accents.
Definitely not a film for the
squeamish!

The Russian film Farewell, based on
the novel Farewell to Matyora by
Valentin Rasputin, is directed by Elim
Klimov. The film deals with the
evacuation of Matyora, a remote
island village in Siberia, which is to
be flooded for a new hydro-electric
dam. The central character is an old
woman called Daria, who represents
the traditional peasant community and
cannot accept that all she has known
is to be destroyed. Her son, however,
feels that there is no choice and is
given the job of relocating the
peasants to the mainland. However,
the conflict between mother and son
is not exploited in such a way as
would turn the film into an emotive
drama concerning only one family.
The film is very visual, the
atmosphere being created largely by
the evocation of the elemental bond
or empathy that the community has
with nature. Whatever your reaction
to the striking use of nature in the
filming, it remains that the basic
conflict of humanity versus
modernisation and technological
advancement is the overriding
concern in Farewell. In the end
Nature shows its power to thwart
actions and whether, in this case, this
is ultimately advantageous or
detrimental, it points to the simple fact
that human beings are not as in
control as they like to think. Films
with sub-titles are unfortunately not
as widely shown as they should be.
Lack of commercial appeal should not
however deter you from viewing
Farewell. Its appeal lies largely in the
very fact that it gives access to the
perspective of a Soviet filmmaker.
Elim Klimov, recently elected
Secretary of the Soviet Filmmakers'
Union in Moscow, will be in London
to open Farewell at the Renoir
Cinema, Russell Square, WC1, on the
1st May. During his stay he will also
be giving a Guardian Lecture at the
National Film Theatre on Tuesday
28th April, when he will talk about
recent developments in Soviet
cinema.
Catherine Manolopoulos
who would have fought against the
Nazis in the Spanish Civil War, had
he been there. Prochnow forces us to
realise that not all the Germans were
evil, by portraying a character that
everyone can associate with. It's a
pity though, that his wonderful
performance is slightly marred by a
very coarsly acted final drunk scene.
However, his interaction with Mr
Byrne is a delight. Byrne's Kaempffer
is as cold as Prochnow's Woermann
is warm—and these two provide most
interest in an otherwise fairly dull
film.
Why Mr Mann claims that the star
of the film is Scott Glenn, I will never
know. Apart from half a dozen lines
his performance is merely of an
observer, f ' ' 1
of Clint Eastwood
but without the power. His love affair
with Alberta Watson, playing the
daughter of a Jewish professor (Ian
McKellen—perfectly at ease as
normal) brought in to help the
Germans stop the deaths, is as
convincing as Glenn's original
waking scene. This scene is typical
of the whole film, by moving from
a very simple idea, that of Claeken
Trismegistus (Scott Glenn), waking
and realising he must go and kill
Molosar, to a point where the scene
is played with strange lights and the
same music that had been battering
our eardrums since the start, and thus
can only be remembered for the fact
it is curiously out of place in a very
dark and murky film.
The music by Tangerine Dream,
whilefittingthe atmosphere perfectly,
then proceeds to completely negate
this effect by becoming overused and
consequently monotonous. The film
however does have some very good
points, noticably the photography
which ranges from a superb close up
of a match bursting into light, to the
fantastic death scene at the end.
The cameraman saves the film from
descending into the depths of
forgotten flops, although there is also
some good humour. It is an
interesting experience.
Custom car-painting has been in the
doldrums for a long time, but that is
soon to change with the development
of a brand new type of paint. The
paint is composed of liquid crystals
that produce different colours when
a charge is passed through it. The
current causes the particles to line up
in various orientations according to
the current used, and to produce the
vaious hues. Under computer control
very complex designs can be
produced on car bodies in the time
that it takes to spray a normal car.
Once the paint has dried the crystals
stay in place permanently.
It is now possible to produce cars
with instant 'go faster' stipes and paint
furry dice for little more than the cost
of a repray. A further development
to aid advertising on cars and vans is
the moving paintwork, where a
television picture is produced using
a spare car battery to drive the image,
with the production of non-drying
crystals.
Keeping your notepaper in pristine
condition always presents problems.
No matter where it is kept it gets dog-
eared and dirty. However there is
now a solution in the form of bottled
paper. Using differences in surface
tension in the cellulose solution a
complete piece of paper can be poured
in one go. The paper comes in a
variety of sizes and weights marked
by a colour coded top. Scientists are
still working on a way of
incorporating a watermark into each
sheet, something which has so far
eluded them.
Computer technology has once
again come to the aid of the music
industry. The introduction of the
Fairlight synthesizer opened up a
whole new range of sound to the
composer. However, this new found
choice has left them confused as to
which sound to use next, leading to
long delays in recording. The
invention of the new random sound
generator has freed composers from
all this painful decision making by
selecting all the required sounds that
the computer sees fit. The system can
be programmed to take care of
various song types with the settings
of 'Bucks Fizz', 'Peter Gabriel' and
'Stockhausen'.
