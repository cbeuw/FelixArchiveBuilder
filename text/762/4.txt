Letters FELIX, Friday February 6th 1987 4
I beg to
differ,
Mr Goosen
Dear Dave,
Today I attended the talk given by
Mr Goosen from the South African
Embassy Cut of interest in what the
'other side' had to say.
I disagreed with Mr Goosen on
many points but the main source of
disagreement is South Africa's
invasion of neigbouring countries in
the name of countering ' A N C
terrorism' as he put it. He justified
this by saying that the South African
Government couldn't call across
borders to ask the ANC 'terrorists' to
come over. He got applause and
laughter for this tasteless joke.
Earlier in Mr Goosen's talk, he
compared the 'terrorist wing' of the
ANC with the IRA. However, unlike
his country's high handed strikes on
A N C bases in neighbouring
countries, suspected IRA terrorists
must be extradited according to the
laws of the country in which they are
found. He also said that he fully
condoned the killing of A N C
'terrorists' as part of the fight against
terrorism.'
In my opinion this shows a flagrant
lack of respect for the independence
of the surrounding African states. The
South African Government is
violating the constitutions of these
countries and is not being seen to act
within the bounds of international
law. This makes nonsense of their
claims to want peaceful reform and
they are not respecting independent
governments run by black people.
How then can we believe that they
will respect the wishes of South
Africa's black majority whom, he
claims, the South African
Government want to incorporate into
the ruling body of the country.
Yours sincerely,
Kemi Adenubi, Civ Eng II
Protest
imperfect
Dear Sir,
I have just attended Peter Goosen's
talk for ConSoc on South Africa, and
left disgusted. Not by the opinions
expressed by the speaker, but by the
way his views were opposed from
outside the lecture theatre.
"What about democracy?" they
shouted, all but drowning a question
from the floor on votes for blacks.
"What about censorship?" they
yelled, preventing us hearing the
reply. "Tell them about Soweto!" we
heard them bawl. I would have liked
to have heard a reply to that one.
Indeed if they'd been inside the
lecture theatre, putting the point to the
speaker, we all would have heard an
answer. But they weren't.
After the talk I asked, for a future
debate, the names of the ConSoc
organisers. They gave me them. I
asked for the names of some of those
outside, explaining why. "Put up
posters," they said "we'll be there."
They wouldn't give their names, nor
would they be willing to speak for
their cause, debate it, or answer
questions on their views. All things
Peter Goosen would and did do. I
abhor apartheid and mob rule. I
admire Peter Goosen for his public
stand against both.
Yours,
Dan Salmons, Chairman,
Debating Society
Last and
least
Dear Dave,
I have just written a letter to you.
On reflection I realise it to be very
boring, and have therefore thrown it
in the bin.
I hope this action meets with your
approval.
Yours sincerely,
Nosmo King

South African Speaker
Many people I have spoken to since
Peter Goosen's visit on Tuesday have
taken the view that his ideas were
fairly progressive, and that his wish
for a ' 'one man one vote system'' was
genuine. It has also been noted that
nearly all the coloured people who
attended came to listen to Mr
Goosen's speech and ask questions,
rather thanjoin the vociferous group
of demonstrators outside the lecture
theatre. Though I sat and listened
attentively to what he had to say, at
several points during the meeting I
wished I hadjoined the protestors. Mr
Goosen came across as generally very
reasonable, but his arguments about
the use of violence by the ANC were
grossly inconsistent. I do not accept
his contention that the onus is on the
coloured leaders to comeforward and
negotiate. The South African
government have used brutal means
to subdue the majority of the
population; to adopt a ' 'holier than
thou" attitude and refuse to negotiate
with groups who may have condoned
violent acts is hypocrisy of a
disgraceful nature. Oppression by
violence will breed violence; if the
South African government is
threatened by terrorism, then that
terrorism is of its own making. Their
regime is both inhuman and morally
wrong, and they should not look for
concessionsfrom the resistance before
pursuing meaningful reforms.
