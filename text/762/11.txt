Cluba FELIX, Friday February 6th 1987
CYCLING
O n y o u r b i k e s
With the first race of the season
looming, the serious racing members
of the club have increased their
training schedules to include two
weights-sessions and swimming each
week, in addition to maintaining an
average of at least thirty miles on the
bike per day whenever possible.
Well-established riders Rob Newton,
Steve Turtle, Andy Major and
Matthew Whitaker are already
beginning to look like a formidable
team for the season ahead, with
several new-comers also showing
great promise at a relatively early
stage in their training.
Due to Katherine Hunter's
unexpected success in the Student
National 10-mile Championship last
year (where she finished 2nd in the
womens' category), the Club would
very much like to recruit a full
womens' team (of at least three
members) to enter all of the Student
National events this year—where they
would have a very good chance of
winning team prizes. However, since
Katherine graduated in the summer
we now only have one serious female
member, and shall have to pass up a
golden opportunity for prize-winning
unless we rectify the situation shortly.
Racing aside, new touring members
are also a bit thin on the ground so
far. People tend to forget that there
is a more relaxed side to cycling—
we do, in fact organise touring
weekends on a regular basis, but
cancel them through lack of support
on an equally regular basis. These
events are normally fun, and consist
for the greater part of stopping every
few miles for cream teas in quaint old
cottage-restaurants. It would be nice
to see this side of the Club expand as
well as the racing teams.
The Cycling Club is here for all of
you to enjoy—we meet at 12.30pm on
Thursdays above the Southside Bar to
plan a programme for the week
ahead—so do come along and talk to
us if you are at all interested. We will
be happy to offer advice on equipment
and maintenance to anyone in trouble
and will shortly have a full set of tools
in the workshop to help you get your
bike roadworthy.

PARACHUTING
Out o f the blue
Ever thought of joining those fearless
daredevils who love to throw
themselves out of planes at ridiculous
heights! The next bit wasn't a sentence
so we didn't print it. If so then why
not join the ultra safety conscious
parachute club and learn hoe to sky
dive?
We're holding a first jump course
on the 25th and 26th of this month.
Two fully qualified parachute
instructors will be coming down to
College to instruct you how to
parachute. The course is only £65 for
your first jump and after that any
further jumps will cost you as little
as £4 a time.
We are holding a meeting in the
Lounge (Beit Quad) on Tuesday 17th
at 12.30 to 1.00pm. If you want to
join the club and learn how to
parachute come along and we'll give
you further details. Could you also
bring £4 club membership and a £10
deposit for the course so we can
estimate the numbers involved.
SAILING
H i g h s e a s
The IC team braved the cold and did
battle in a friendly match with a mixed
Bristol team. Adam Stork showed
considerable potential with aggressive
tactics, despite tangling with one of
the buoys, but IC were narrowly
defeated. In the second race Richard
Jarman led the team in a roundabout
way but IC's superior boatspeed
helped them level the score.
Both teams revelled in the close
competition and improved throughout
the day. The final race was the closest
of the day. Several of the Bristol team
were forward at the start but
Apostolous Leonhidopolous was in
i hot pursuit for IC. The positions were
changing constantly, Ape went to the
back at one point, but brilliant team
work by Richard Brimelow and Sam
Page gained a winning 1, 2
combination. Gareth David suffered
major gear failure on the last leg,
preventing a clean sweep. The final
result was open to interpretation (each
team claimed to have won) but we
owe our thanks to Bristol for
organising '' 'st weekend of the
season.
Team: Sam Page (Capt), Richard
Brimelow, Richard Jarman, Adam
Stork, Gareth David, Apostolous

H i g h C ' s
There were two children brought up
by Little Buttercup, a Portsmouth
bumboat woman. One infant is
wealthy, well-connected etc; the other
is of more lowly descent. At this
point, Little Buttercup gets the pair
mixed up (this seems to be obligatory
in such cases).
Time goes by. The child of humble
descent becomes Captain Corcoran of
Her Majesties Ship Pinafore, the
other is now Ralph Rackstraw a
humble fore-mast hand on board the
very same ship. Love now decides to
do a spot of burgeoning. Captain
Corcoran has a grown-up daughter,
Josephine, who loves and is loved by
Ralph Rackshaw. Little Buttercup
sustains an ill-concealed passion for
her erstwhile charge, Captain
Corcoran who is prevented from
responding, only by his snobbery.
The arrival of the First Lord of the
Admiralty, Sir Joseph Porter plus a
retinue of sisters, cousins and aunts
stirs things up a bit. Sir Joseph wants
to marry the Captain's daughter and
his plea that love levels all ranks (in
case she should feel in awe of him)
so affects her that she determines to
elope with Ralph Rackstraw after all.
The attempt is eventually foiled by
Captain Corcoran, who is so
aggrieved by Ralph's temerity in
loving the Captain's daughter, that he
uses a rude word. This, if we are to
trust the historical verisimilitude of
Mr Gilbert's work is a pretty heinous
crime. Ralph too is imprisoned by Sir
Joseph, and Buttercup selects this epic
juncture to reveal the true identities
of Ralph and the Captain. Evidently
this changes everything—Sir Joseph
no longer wants to marry Josephine
now she is the daughter of a humble
fore-mast hand so she is free to marry
Ralph. Ex-Captain Corcoran,
released from the toils of his own
snobbery, is free to marry Little
Buttercup. For the sake of
thoroughness Sir Joseph marries
Hebe, an obnoxious cousin of his.
Also being performed is "The
Zoo'' by Sullivan and Rowe—a turgid
tale of love thwarted by a stern father.
It also contains a peer in the guise of
a saxophonist, a lobster in the guise
of a Pterodactyl, and some elephant
manure in a galvanised bucket.
All this takes place in the Union
Concert Hall at 7.30pm from Tuesday
10th February to Saturday 14th
February. Tickets are avialable from
Sherfield level 2, the Union building
entrance (next to Norman's)—at
lunchtimes and also from the Haldane
Library, OpSoc members or on the
door.

G o i n g our w a y ?
IC Film Society's next presentation,
this Thursday 12th in Physics LT1
(doors 7.30pm) is The ffi'/cfer (1986)
starring Rutger Haver (Eureka, Blade
Runner).
C Thomas Howell plays a young
guy who must fight for his life when
The Hitcher (Rutger Haver) tries to
frame him for his ugly crimes.
Schwarzenegger might make a good
macho hero, but Rutger Haver is
much more subtle and never more so
than in this breathtakingly taut
thriller-on-wheels.
The tension in the film is piled on
with a fork-lift truck, and the suspense
is almost unbearable. The story line
works with the deadly accuracy of
knife through butter.
One reviewer described Haver's
performance as "brilliant and
disturbingly dangerous; enough to
leave you with the impression that he
is genuinely mad." Enough said?
Next Thursday FilmSoc is showing
the highly acclaimed thriller Jagged
Edge, starring Jeff Bridges and Glen
Close.
50p members, £1 non-members,
membership available.

Following criticism from on high that
QTSoc has become Dayist, meetings
have now been rescheduled from
Tuesdays to Thursdays. This
Thursday has been de^gnated a
cardboard box meeting, and we need
as many members as possible to bring
vast numbers of boxes to Southside
Upper Lounge at 1pm. After
performing the traditional dance of
the cardboard box, the boxes will be
stripped down and used to construct
essential items of equipment, as
detailed at the (hush, hush) Extremely
Extraordinary Meeting last week.
SOCSOC
Dates
There has been a change of date for
Tony Benn MP. He is now coming
on 23rd February (not 16th as
before). We also have former
broadcaster Austin Mitchell MP (later
this term) and Labour Defence
Spokesman Denzil Davies MP.
All are welcome to these meetings.
We meet most Tuesdays in the Green
Committee Room (top floor Union
building) so please come along, if
only for a chat, or see Adrian
Grainger (Chair), Maths 2.
