in Dehli, w h i c h
Imperial College's

Department helped to
design
A new Mother Temple for the Baha'i
has recently been dedicated in Delhi.
Claimed to rival the Taj Mahal in
beauty, it has been built to resemble
a lotus—sacred flower of India—in
bloom, afloat among its leaves.
The complex, covering some eight
hectares, consists of the main House
of Worship, a reception centre, a
library and an adminstrative block.
People of every faith will be
welcomed, with no religious
ceremonies or rituals taking place
other than readings from the
scriptures of the major religions. This
temple will be the centrepiece of the
other six Baha'i temples built so far
as centres for assembly,
contemplation and prayer.
It is the construction of this temple
which makes it unique. The plan is
nonagonal, symbolising the unity of
the teachings of nine great religious
prophets. Thus the lotus-shape of the
temple is achieved with three sets of
nine leaves around an inner traceried
dome. The first set face outwards and
form entrances to the ring-shaped
hall, the second set curve inwards and
the third set nearly close to form a
bud, but the tops open gently out, and
a glass and steel roof allows light to
filter into the building. Nine pools,
bridges and balustrades surround the
complex.
The building of the temple
presented considerable difficulties.
No straight lines were used, which
made the task so complex that two and
a half years were needed to
completely work out the geometry
and engineering drawings. The lack
of well-developed concrete
technology in India, and the
unavailability of a certain type of
rolled steel for reinforcement
hampered the construction. In all it
took the efforts of up to eight hundred
Lotus leaves
for the Baha V
people over ten years to complete the
temple.
A mixture of white cement, silica
sand and dolomite aggregate was used
to construct the leaves, which though
towering to 34 metres in the centre
are in parts only 6 centimetres thick.
Engineering played a part here,
testing models of the structure in a
wind tunnel to check wind pressure
distributions and ventilation. The
complex techniques necessary for
construction and reinforcement had to
be checked at every step. Hot weather
caused problems as well; elaborate
precautions had to be taken to keep
the concrete cool while it was mixed
and set. The final stage was to clad
the shells and arches with panels of
white Greek marble, carefully shaped
and fitted by means of stainless steel
brackets.
The end result, dramatic though
somewhat resembling the Sydney
Opera House, was meant to embody
the 'purity and oneness of the Baha'i
faith' by its architect, the Canadian
Baha'i, Fariburz Sahba.
The expected longevity of the temple
meant it had to be designed to
withstand great stresses whether from
earthquakes or from gales. Imperial

Impressions
My initial and lasting impression of
New Delhi is the visible extremes
between the rich and the poor. The
airport was rather impressive but
men, women and children were
sitting, permanently by the look of it,
on the cold stone floors at the exit.
And the beggars, wearing tattered
clothes; and those better dressed, but
only just, too ready to accept handouts
for services rendered, like the counter
clerk who let me use his desk
telephone (how I missed British
Telecom then!) and smilingly said
afterwards "Nothing in life is free,
madam." I stood bewildered and
fascinated at the edge of the motorway
outside the three star hotel and ox-
drawn carts, bicycles, three-wheeled
covered scooters, taxis (looking the
part in a 60's movie), sports cars and
mopeds with business men and
briefcases, all zoomed past. A very
incident-free lawless melee. It was
like that everywhere—a juxtaposition
of the have and have-nots
I was inspired by the Lotus Temple.
'It is an architectural gem—it seemed
to be floating, with its surrounding
nine pools. It's caused by all those
curves. During the opening ceremony
I felt thrilled. There were selected
Writings from the Hindu, Moslem,
Christian, Buddhist and Baha'i
scriptures. It didn't matter then
whether the person next to me was
from a different religious background
or not, the Baha'i Houses of Worship
welcome all peoples to worship. The
highlight of my temple experience
happened during dawn prayers one
day. A bird flew into the building,
perched itself on one of the interior
petals, and proceeded to sing
throughout the entire devotional
recitations. A delight for the 3000-odd
people there.
Socially the Baha'i conference
accompanying the dedication was the
high point. Over 104 different
countries were represented by the
8000 participants. I cherish my chats
with musicians from the Seychelles,
lapanese, a family living in Nepal and
an Australian working with the
aborigines; I rode an elephant; I
scalded my heart and soul (and
tongue) with authentic South Indian
dosa; and learnt the art of slowing
down my thinking and doing
processes—an art the average Indian
appeared to have mastered to
perfection.
Oh! and I now appreciate a glass
of water from our taps to a degree I
never, ever thought possible. The
'Delhi belly' experience caused that!

The Baha'i Society at Imperial
College has listed in its membership
students from Africa, Britain, the
Caribbean and the Middle East. With
such a variety of cultures, the Baha'i
Society organises activities which
provide for the interests of all its
members, thus demonstrating one of
the essential principles of the Baha'i
Faith—the oneness of the human race.
The Baha'i Society also organises
occasional events aimed at attracting
the interest of all students. Prominent
speakers from various religions and
humanitarian organisations are invited
to express their views on a topic of
general interest; and where possible
interfaith meetings are held, in
cooperation with other religious
societies at IC, in accordance with the
Baha'i teaching that all religions are
basically one.
One of the astounding beliefs of the
Baha'i Faith is that 'world peace is
not only possible but inevitable,' and
that 'humanity has now reached the
darkest hour before dawn.' Thus the
governing body of the Baha'i has
published a document discussing the
practicalities " achieving world
peace, which the society distributes
to members of staff and students.
A slide show of the opening
ceremony of the Indian Temple will
be shown on Thursday 26th February
at 1.00pm in LT4 Chem. Eng. Dept.

As students at Imperial College we
are mostly training to become
scientists or engineers or accountants.
We hope to acquire an ability to
function and make decisions in a
technologically advanced world. This
ability includes such mundane skills
as knowledge acquisition and
organisation, experimental technique,
report writing, etc.
Are there any other skills we should
wish to acquire in order to function
as scientists, engineers or
accountants?
Our world is increasingly coming
to accept that decisions should be
made after considering human and
moral questions, as well as issues of
economics and technological
possibility. In this column, I want to
try to look a little at the moral and
human issues which are relevant to
us. I'm not a philosopher, so I can't
write much about the detailed thought
which has gone into such issues over
the past millenia. Similarly, I'm not
a theologist, so I won't attempt to put
forward any particular religious view
(there are plenty of other people who
are only too glad to do that). I am a
writer, so I want to look at how
writing can be used to look at these
issues.
Writing can be used to raise
questions and, possibly to suggest
answers. The best writing does not act
. i propaganda, spouting forth simple
dogma as a solution to complex
problems; but rather, it causes the
reader to think about new issues (or
about old issues in a new way) and
allows him to find his own answers.
Good writing lays down a solid
foundation, upon which fhe reader
can build his own ideas. (Of course,
skillful writing may also act to push
the reader in a particular direction, by
addressing the emotions. The reader
should be aware of this. However,
human beings are emotional animals,
and questions about human issues can
only be answered fully by considering
the emotions as well as the "facts").
These ideas are best pursued by
illustration, so I will present an
attempt to look at the issues of
economics and mining, and their
impact on individuals and
communities. These issues are of
obvious interest to many people in this
college.

As the cage drops you enter her
and can no longer breathe
except through her.
Safety is your illusion:
her ribs and back surround you,
but there is no pleasure
away from her embrace—
Wish only for the deception to
continue.
On the final shift
I wash off the smell of her
and try to run away.
There are no words;
only an empty locker
and a redundancy cheque

grave
(first published in Envoi 86)
I won't belittle the poem by
attempting a detailed analysis of it: its
message is quite clear. My point is
that, as scientists, we should be aware
of such issues. (You may also wish
to consider how the poem achieves,
or fails to achieve, its impact; whether
the sexual/sexist viewpoint is relevant
to the issue in question; and any
number of other questions arising
from this single short poem).
This column will be an occasional
(or regular, depending on my energy
and your input) feature in FELIX for
the next couple of terms. I would
welcome input from other members
of College, especially in the form of
poetry or (very) short stories
addressing the issues of the human
impact of science and technology.
Comments on the questions I raise are
also welcome.
