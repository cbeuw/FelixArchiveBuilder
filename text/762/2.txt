FELIX, Friday February 6th 1987 2
Oppressed
Minority
Dear Dave,
I must say that I was rather
saddened to read the letter in last
weeks' FELIX written by Messrs
Reese, Farhead, Rowe and Kennedy
on the appointment of a Lesbian and
Gay Welfare Office. I feel that the
following points need a specific reply.
Firstly, the writers mention 'the
excellent service provided by U L U . '
I assume from the tone of their
comments that they are not gay. This
suggests that they have never visited
the ULU Gay and Lesbian Group;
how can they know if it is excellent?
In any case, no matter how good
it may be, it only meets once a week,
and the number of students attending
from IC is probably low. An IC
student attending such a group for
perhaps the first time in his/her life,
would surely find it a daunting
experience.
Secondly, the writers raise the point
of minority representation. Leaving
Council out of things for the moment,
do they object to the idea of a Gay
Society? If so, then they should
remember that it only takes one
person armed with 20 signatures to
set up such societies as Sri Lankan
Soc or HamSoc. Statistically it is
likely that there are more than 500
gay undergraduates at IC: Are there
that many Sri Lankans or radio hams?
I very much doubt it.
Returning to Council, what right
have we to deny gay representation,
at a time when at least 10% of
students of IC may be living in fear
of discovery by a homophobic 'moral
majority'?
Surely such an oppressed group
needs a Welfare Officer?
Yours sincerely

...but not
different
of discrimination that IC's gay and
lesbian students receive should expect
IC Union's support. In this case the
Union has decided that the best way
of supporting gays and lesbians is to
appoint an Officer to represent them
and organise a Gay Soc. This is a wise
decision. Individuals who feel
threatened can reduce that threat by
organising.
It is stupid to argue that minorities
should not be represented on Council.
Overseas students, women, chemical
engineers and sports players (I believe
these are minorities at IC) have
representatives on Council.
If people really object to a Lesbian
and Gay Welfare Officer they
shouldn't be so homophobic, then
there wouldn't be a need for such a
person.

Impure
Eysenck
Dear Dave,
I noted with some concern in last
week's FELIX that WellSoc is to
invite Hans Eysenck to speak on the
9th of February; the so-called "world
authority on intelligence and IQ
tests."
Although indeed an influential
psychologist, Eysenck has spent much
of his time since the early 1970's, and
the publication of his book "Race,
Intelligence and Education,"
promoting not only the idea that
intelligence is almost wholly
genetically determined but, also that
black people do not, on average,
possess the same intellectual
capacities as whites.
Eysenck, not surprisingly, has
found little favour within the scientific
community; not only have most other
notable psychologists poured scorn on
his theories, but opposition has also
come from eminent geneticists and
biologists too, including Nobel
Laureate Sir Peter Medewar, who
have stressed that environmental
factors play a major part in human
intelligence, and that intelligence
itself is much too complicated to be
expressed by a single IQ score.
However, Eysenck has found
considerable support within the ultra-
right, who found that the 'race-
science' propagated in 1930's
Germany had found a new ally;
indeed Eysenck's book was soon on
the recommended booklist of the
National Front. (An alleged interview
with Eysenck also appeared in an
edition of the fascist magazine
"Beacon" in Feb '77, published by
a splinter group from the Front).
Eysenck has also been associated
with the openly racist journal "The
Mankind Quarterly" (as a member of
the Honorary Advisory Board), which
has included many articles in support
of apartheid in South Africa and
Rhodesia, and which has included
many references to the work of Hans
Giinther, the leading pre-war German
'race-scientist', whose theories
outlined the "worth of Nordic racial
purity" and "the perils of Jewish
contaminationf'
I can only hope that WellSoc
realises the mistake that it has made
in inviting Eysenck to College; I
hardly think that this kind of racial
nonsense is what its members want to
listen to.

Sad PATA
Dear Dave,
I am writing in reference to the Oliva
Gans lecture against abortion on Jan
26th which I was unable to attend.
First of all, I found the publicity quite
distressing. I had an abortion about
six or seven months ago which I am
trying hard to forget. The posters
proclaiming me a 'victim of abortion'
did nothing to help the healing
process. When I chose abortion, I
chose life for me. Had I a baby at 18
as I was then, I would never have
been able to put the child up for
adoption (nor, I believe would my
boyfriend). I would have ended up
married with a baby, no degree, and
not much of a life ahead of me. As
Chas Jackson pointed out, PATA is
supposed to show positive alternatives
to abortion. For me there was no
positive alternative. For most women
who don't want to throw themselves
away on a child they didn't want, a
husband they mightn't stick with and
all career prospects destroyed, there
are no positive alternatives.
It should be the woman's right to
choose.

The Other
Side
Dear Dave
In answer to Chas Jackson's letter
(FELIX No 760), I would like to
point out that a large amount of
PATA's activities have, in fact,
emphasized the positive alternatives
to abortion.
Indeed, not only is much of our
literature devoted to the subject but
many of our guests have spoken on
it as well. Planned for this term is a
debate relating to positive alternatives
to abortion, which will go ahead if we
are able to find someone from the pro-
abortion lobby who is willing to
speak.
As an example of our activities, I
would like to recall a talk given by
Angela Gracey, of LIFE, at the very
beginning of last term. It was called
"The Positive Alternatives to
Abortion." In her talk Angela Gracey
illustrated how voluntary
organisations, such as LIFE, provide
support to pregnant women who are
under pressure to have an abortion.
This support, she said, includes
accommodation, health care, material
help and financial advice (all before
and after birth) and not least, advice
given on adoption of supposedly
"unwanted" children. Thus, she spelt
out how a woman who chooses not
to abort is given help both to choose
and to bring about a future for her
child; adoption, special medical care
or caring for it herself being a few of
the positive alternatives to killing it.
Yours,
M Soane (PATA Treasurer)
Mouthpiece
Dear FELIX
FELIX is, I presume, the 'official'
mouthpiece of ICU. The Union
however claims to be 'non-political'
and uses this as part of its justification
for remaining aloof from the NUS.
If this 'non-political' stance is so
important to the Union why does it
give so much space (V4 page in this
issue) to the meetings of the
Conservative Society?
I want to read, in a student paper,
about those issues which are
important to me as a student. If I want
to read political propoganda I will buy
the Express (or one of the other Tory
Fleet Street rags).
Nuff said, I think.

Light
Fingers
Dear Dave,
Thursday evening some twat (or
perhaps t**t) in College thought it'd
be a bit of a laugh to steal the lights
from a bike and then return them
Friday morning with a note saying
'never leave your cycle lights on the
bike.'
As I don't know who it was, could
he please contact me through FELIX
to pay me Â£1.80 for bus fares, buy
my next week's shopping at
Sainsbury's and get a good kick in the
groin.
Yours sincerely,
Irate Biker
Dear Dt.- 1
Lesbians and gays are not different.
Yet anyone who admits to being gay
at Imperial College is subjected to
abuse and ridicule. Statistics suggest
that 10% of IC students should be
gay. How many gay and lesbian
students do you know? IC has a
homophobic atmosphere that either
forces people to hide their sexuality
or discourages gays and lesbians from
applying to IC.
