Clubs FELIX, Friday February 6th 1987 1 2
RUGBY
After trekking North of the Arctic
Circle to Welwyn Garden City, the
team was picked up at the station by
a police van (complete with riot
squad). The match started in
reasonable, if cold, conditions, the
first half was very evenly matched,
ending at 0-0. The IC pack evenly
matched the Police pack, and put on
a good show in the set scrums. The
line defended well, and put the Police
under pressure when they were given
clean possession. The second half
started badly for the College, with the
Police flanker going over in the
corner for a try, which was well
converted by their fly-half. IC re-
started, and after the pack won good

second-phase ball, the line on it well
down the centre of the field. Fly-half
Grant Hamilton kicked through, and
was then blatantly blocked by one of
the Police players. The referee
awarded a penalty try to the College,
which was converted by Grant
Hamilton. IC slowly gained the upper
hand, and from the Police 22-meter
line, John Peacock (scrum-half)
passed to Jason Jenkins (tight-head
prop), to Frank Millar (2nd row) to
Rob Hargrove (8th man), who scored
under the posts after a never-before
seen display of athleticism to put IC
ahead. This was converted, and IC
ended up the winners by 12 points to
6.
TEN PIN BOWLING
Pigs will be flying, Sheffield flooding
and the moon will be a lovely shade
of ultramarine. Why? IC 10 Pin
Bowling Club has finally won! A
dishevelled looking Brunei team
ventured down from the backwaters
of downtown Uxbridge and probably
wished they hadn't.
The 'A' team won by over 350 pins
even though they lost the second
game.
The 'B' team won all three games
though all three were quite close.
The same score was achieved by
the ' C team, who bowled very well.
The only team to lose was the ladies
who, with a player short, didn't stand
a chance. This has been the case all
season so if there are any women out
there who'd like to join see the
'What's On' guide.
The Club continued its new-found
winning ways on Saturday at what is
the premier national handicapped
doubles event. Six teams were taken,
with IC finishing first and second in
the handicap and third in the scratch.
In the surroundings of fading fifties
The Hyde Park Relays, the largest
student relays in the country, will take
place on Saturday February 14th. On
that day, 1300 runners will converge
on Hyde Park, including a smattering
of internations such as 1984 London
Marathon winner Charlie Spedding.
As well as teams from all over the
UK, there are entries from as far
afield as Norway and Holland. The
event is organised by the Cross-
country and Athletics Club and we
have been fortunate to obtain
sponsorship from Nike, Barclays and
Firkin, the latter providing free beer
to competitors.
sleaze our teams struggled on the
dead-end alleys of the Airport Bowl.
With balls that had gouges out of them
bigger than the finger-holes and
machinery that sounded like 16th
century printing presses, things did
not look so good after the first three
games.
However, consistently good
bowling from Chris Wheeldon and
Paul Gaines took them into first place
in both the scratch and handicap
sections. Although overtaken by a
whisker in the scratch they easily held
onto first place in the handicap.
Superb bowling by Richard Ingram
helped him and his partner Andrew
Tress into second place in the
handicap, only 30 pins behind their
team-mates.
This was a very good all round
performance by the six teams, that
also included Anita Lee, Nicky
Fletcher, Tim Cordingley, Simeon
Paster, Nick Brigham, Eric Barfield,
Kashif Saeed and Martin Morris.
So, after two successive victories
is there no stopping this team?
The course is a loop around the
Serpentine starting near the top of
Rotten Row. The relay starts at
2.30pm with the mens' race
consisting of 6 legs and the womens'
four. Standards are invariably high
with the leading men completing the
3 mile course in under 13 Vz minutes.
If previous years are anything to go
by, Birmingham and Loughborough
will be the teams to watch.
Although the orienteers have kindly
agreed to provide marshals, we could
still use some extra help on the day,
the incentive being a free Hyde Park
Relay T-shirt.
A fine winter's day at Harlington saw
another character testing game from
the IC II's. IC began well with Keelin
and Poppy making things happen
down the right flank. Many chances
were squandered until J West firmly
headed home an S Dunthrone cross
in the 23rd minute. IC sought to
strengthen their lead but their best
chance was cleared off the line from
8 yards after a close range shot from
Adams.
SOP's brutish centre-forward then
took a hand in the proceedings. First
he latched onto a poor pass from
Dunthorne and only magnificent
timing by J Wreford, the IC keeper,
saved a certain goal. Then Wreford
punted the ball forward, only for the
SOP midfield to head forward. Their
centre-forward reached the ball first
again, and his lob shot caught
Wreford stranded off his line to make
the score 1-1. Shortly before half-time
the same centre-forward caused more
problems for IC. From a corner he
blatantly pushed Rob Kelly, his
marker, and then headed the ball into
the net. The goal was given despite
angry protests from Barrow, the IC
skipper.
The second half began poorly for
IC and things looked grim. But as the
game wore on IC began to regain their
composure. Pressure began to build
up on the SOP goal. Barrow's
blistering shot from the edge of the
area crashed against the underside of
the'bar and bounced on the line;
Keelin's cry of "lucky bastards" was
treated with a smile by the referee.
Minutes later Gordon brought relief
to IC as he confidently shot home
from inside the SOP area.
With 8 minutes to go a draw looked
irnminent(e/i?-Â£tf,). Phil Adams
thought differently, though, and his
beautiful, curled chip shot from 20
yards became the winner for IC.
