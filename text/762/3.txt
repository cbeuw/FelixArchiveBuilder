Grants up by 3.75%
The Government has announced an
increase of 3.75 per cent in student
grants for the year 1987.88.
Mr. Kenneth Baker, Secretary of
State for Education and Science,
announced the increase in reply to a
written question in the Commons.
The London weighted grant for
undergraduate students in lodgings is
to increase to £2330 from the present
£2246, and the postgraduate grant
will increase to £3492. Students living
at home will receive £1567 if they are
Mr. Baker also announced that the
threshold for parental contributions

postgraduates.
will be raised by about 6.75 percent.
The minimum parental contribution
will be raised from £20 to £40, and
the maximum will increase by £300
to £4600.
IC Union President, Christine Taig,
said she felt that to increase the grants
in line with inflation was at least a step
in the right direction, but a substantial
increase was necessary, particularly
to the London grant, if students were
to have enough to live on. Bearing in
mind that most students have about
£15 a week after paying rent, to brag
about an increase in line with inflation
was ridiculous, she told FELIX.
Linstead conman
A Linstead resident was robbed of
£500 earlier this term by a conman
who told the student he had lost all
his money. The student was
approached by a man driving a car
along Prince Consort Road. The
driver, who was French, told the
student that he needed the money to
get back home, and managed to
persuade him to give him £500 in
cash. (The student was only carrying
such a large amount because he had
recently returned from abroad
himself).
The incident occurred on
Wednesday 7th January, during the
first week of the term. Since then the
conman, who is described as being
short, stocky and blond has also
attempted to rob residents of Beit hall.
Though he has not been seen in the
vicinity for over two weeks, all
students are advised to be on the look
out for this man.

Iraqi demo
There will be a demonstration outside
the Iraqi Embassy in Queensgate at
lpm today, in protest over the
treatment of Iraqi students, both in
Britain and in Iraq. Students have
been forced to join the war with Iran,
or, if abroad, have been made to
return to Iraq.
ICU President Christine faig and
several Union officers will be taking
part in the demonstration, and all iC
students have been encouraged to
attend to protest against the severe
infringement of student rights which
Iraq practices.
RCM drunks
Drunken students from the Royal
College of Music smashed glass and
insulted IC Union Bar staff in the Bar
last Tuesday afternoon. The incident
occured when barman Sean Davis
refused to serve one of the students.
A security guard was called in to
throw the student out. The student
broke the glass of one of the doors
with his violin case as he was being
escorted out of the Bar.
IC Union President, Christine Taig,
has sent a letter of protest to the RCM
Principal and Union President
deploring the fact that some R C M
students had taken advantage of IC
Unions "all welcome" policy.
