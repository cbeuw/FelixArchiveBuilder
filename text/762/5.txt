Heliconic Hassles — solution
Of the three solutions I recieved to
this, only one solved the problem
using the easiest and neatest method
of modular arithmetic. In modular
arithmetic (also known as 'clock'
arithmetic) an integer number is only
considered as it's remainder when
devided by another, for example the
number 23 taken modulus 5 (this is
notated 23mod5) is equal to 3. Notice
that, modulus 5, all numbers become
either 0,1,2,3,or 4 (0 if the number
is divisible by 5). Modular arithmetic
works as ordinary arithmetic under
addition and subtraction, e.g. (6 +
7)mod5 = 6mod5 + 7mod5 i.e.
13mod5 = 3 = 1 + 2. Of course
these equations work equally well
modulus any number, but 5 is the
number we are interested in. When
squaring numbers you have to be
more careful in modular arithmetic,
the correct expression is (X2
)mod5
= (Xmod5)2
mod5 (you can check
that). So the possible results, mod5,
of squaring any integer can only be:
02
mod5 = 0, l 2
mod5 = 1,
22
,nod5 = 4,32
mod5 = 1, and
42
mod5= 1, i.e. 0,1,4, are the only
possible results.
Now consider taking Pythagoras'
equation, X 2
+ Y 2
= Z 2
, modulus
5. The equation can only now involve
the numbers 0,1,or 4, and is
impossible to complete using just 1
and 4. Thus, taken mod5, one of
X 2
, Y 2
,or Z 2
, must be zero and
thus one of X,Y,Z must be divisible
by 5. Well done if you followed all
that, I hope I explained it clearly.
The winner was Edward Phiri,
Mech Eng 1, who's solution was a lot
less elegant than this, although
correct. You can collect your £5 after
1.00pm Wednsday.
Hexagonal Unsymmetry
Since I can't think of an unamusing
story to go with this problem I'll just
tell it to you. Imagine you have 19
points arranged in a hexagon as
shown below.
Now imagine picking 10 of them
so that there are an even number of
points in every column, row, and
diagonal. One of the solutions to this
is shown below, but notice that it has
a plane of symmetry (as shown).
What I want is simply a solution that
has no plane of symmetry. There is
only one — good luck.
Solutions, for the £5 prize, to the
FELIX office by 1.00pm Wednsday,
please. Keep the original problems
coming in too, you'll get a credit if
I use one, I promise!

Walter
Walter is pleased to return to a new
publication after a period of absence
due to illness. For the benefit of his
new readers he has asked me to define
his aim in these columns: The job of
a satire, it has been rightly said, is to
strip off the veneer of cosy
respectability and half truth in which
we clothe ourselves, and Walter's
post, as he sees it, is to put it back
again.
The main furore in past weeks has
concerned a certain fast-food outlet
which has been much under fire by
Hurricane Christine. Walter has
refused to be drawn on this, except
for a rare misquote: Ninety percent
imagination and ten percent
indigestion...
Of much more interest to such a
sporting chap at this time of the year,
approaching once more, when
putative sabbaticals don the gloves
and start swinging with all their
might. Doubly interesting this year to
observe the possible use of a hockey
stick as a weapon! Walter does wish,
however, that these people would stop
swinging once they have been elected.
The final subject of Walters
attention this week, is the move afoot
on the part of ULU to make (and he
quotes): "Hard-wearing condoms and
water-based lubricants available in
every bar in every college..."
Walter feels that most bars already
provide an acceptable range of water-
based lubricants, and with the current
popularity of tinned light beers,
someone at Imperial is due for a nasty
shock if they approach the barman
and ask for a six-pack of Red Stripe.
