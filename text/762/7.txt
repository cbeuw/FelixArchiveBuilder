Right Charlies
b y R 2 D 2
The recent disappearance of hundreds
of walking sticks from the Health
Centre in Princes Gardens has fueled
speculation that the College is on the
verge of an outbreak of Chaplinism.
Despite this alarming news the
College authorities have made no
attempts to alert students of the
dangers. In this unique exposee
FELIX reporters Phil Hoodwink and
Prichard Stiles reveal the sinister truth
behind the movement.
From its humble beginnings in
Hollywood in 1906 the Chaplin cult
has become one of the most influential
organisations on the planet. Its
membership is currently estimated at
over 1 billion, and the organisation
is known to have penetrated the
hierachy of the world's political
powers.
At the head of the organisation is
one known enigmatically as 'The
Right Charlie', operating from the
'Chaplincy', his secret headquarters
in Princes Gardens.
The Chaplin regime is strict, with
members being expected to rise at
4.30am for early morning cane
twirling and waddling practice.
Braces, of course, must be worn at
all times, even in bed. Becoming a
Chaplinite is not easy, and members
are selected only after months of
observation and careful vetting. Even
then becoming an "apprentice
Chaplin" entails a grueling ceremony
which trainees are expected to balance
a cane on the end of their nose whilst
riding a bicycle along a tight rope.
Becoming an "under Charlie" is even
more tortuous and candidates are
expected to save a heroine from the
railway tracks in under three seconds,
and to give her a kiss without the
bowler hat falling off. The task has
become more difficult in recent times
with the introduction of electrified
rails.
Chaplinites meet on a weekly basis
to perform a ceremony known as
"slinging the fish." Here, the "major
Charlies" don the traditional zoo
keepers costume and throw fish to
apprentices and "under Charlies"
who catch them in their teeth. Then,
at the end of the ceremony, the
Chaplinite anthem "Hit Me With
Your Rhythm Stick" is sung and the
ritual cane dance performed.
The movement has, in modern
times, begun to infiltrate the
controlling echelons of society. The
Civil Service and the Stock Exchange
have been penetrated to such an extent
that Chaplinites can be seen donning
their attire in publicâ€”the bowler hat
and the walking stick craftily
disguised as an umbrella. In fact, the
secret Chaplinite hat tilt is almost a
thing of the past, with a number of
Chaplinites publicly admitting their
Chaplinesque tendancies.
The greatest question though still
remains unanswered: Who is the
current Right Charlie? There has been
much speculation that Edwina Currie
is a likely candidate, but even she

Just when you thought it was safe to

What's all the fuss about this time?
The problem is constitutions; what are
they for, whether they should be
broken, with specific reference to the
President of RCSU. It's comments
like "I'm quite prepared to go against
the constitution if necessary," that are
the problem, and they make it quite
clear that Simon Singh hasn't the
faintest notion what a constitution is
for.
Now, like a good essayist, I reach
for my copy of the Oxford English
Dictionary and find out the definition
of constitution. "Body of fundamental
principles according to which a state
is governed" is what the book says,
and what are our fundamental
principles? I think most people would
agree that in this college, the
fundamental principles are those of
democracy. Now I've made some
cutting comments about democracy
and its efficiency as a governing
system, but it is the agreed basis of
how we do things here, and it is the
only way of keeping all of the people
fairly happy most of the time.
Whatever anyone says about how a
democratic body is run, they only
have themselves to blame for voting
for it in the first place.
Now, when a constitution is broken
someone's democratic rights are
being abused for the benefit of
someone else. The end result of the
process is dissatisfaction, loss of good
will, and, at the very least, a lot of
bad feeling that hampers the running
of an organistion, and in the worst
case the offended body disintegrates
completely.
Now, Simon has some very
personal and distinct views of how
RCS should be run, and feels that it
is his duty to "achieve something"
with the Union. He also feels that he
has only a sh- 'me to do this and
to expedite his changes he is "quite
prepared to go against the
constitution." He justifies this by
saying firstly that his proposed
changes are to the general good, and
everyone will agree with them
anyway. Okay, if they are so good
why not propose them to a meeting
and actually get a mandate to do what
you want? There were only two RCS
UGM's last term, one of those the
Fresher's one, and both in the early
part of the term. It took a petition of
50 signatures to force Simon to hold
an EGM at the end of the term. Simon
explained that no other UGM's had
been held because of illness on the
part of Guy Perry, RCS Hon Sec,
who constitutional job it was to
arrange meetings. But since Simon is
prepared to go against the constitution
when necessary he could easily have
arranged an U G M himself, if he
thought it necessary. Clearly then he
did not think it was necessary to hold
a U G M to discuss some fairly
sweeping changes that he had
imposed, such as selecting a new
Broadsheet Editor himself. In fact, I
would go so far as to suggest that
Simon felt it was necessary not to hold
a UGM because he knew he would
not get the support he wanftd. So he
purposefully denied members of RCS
of their democratic rights. That is
what happens when constitutions get
broken.
There is good reason why the
constitution of any body makes it
difficult to change things. This is
because changes that are not agreed
upon by the whole concensus of
opinion are dangerous and divisive.
And it's no point saying, and he has,
that if a change imposed by Simon is
wrong then "a good bolloking and...
resignation" will solve matters. The
damage may already have been done
and be irreparable. The whole point
of constitutions being resistant to
change is to prevent one person doing
things that are wrong and potentially
destructive. Change can only be
achieved with stability if it is a process
of evolution rather than revolution.
In describing the RCS constitution
as "sacred scriptures" Simon
demonstrates that he has no respect
for it at all. It's about time he knew
what it was there for, rather than just
regarding it as an obstacle to
moulding RCS into his own, not very
likable, image.
I am very worried about what might
happen to RCS this year, since Simon
seems to believe he has the right to
force anything through that he wants,
without even discussing beforehand
whether he is right or not. It takes
only one slip in this situation to do
severe damage.
I don't think Simon has done any
real damage to RCS yet, but there is
still a long time to the end of the year,
and he has plenty of opportunity left.
I shall be watching developments at
UGM's and GenComms with interest.
