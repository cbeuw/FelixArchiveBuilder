Ash on
Chernobyl
The Rector, Professor Ash, spoke
about his views on the risks associated
with the nuclear industry at a packed
lecture during Tuesday lunchtime.
Speaking in the Read Lecture Theatre
he gave a talk entitled "The
Perception of Risk—A Post-
Chernobyl View" as part of the
regular 'lunchtime programme
organised by the Humanities
Department.
Professor Ash started by discussing
the Chernobyl incident itself and the
problems of drawing meaningful
conclusions from estimates of the
death toll. He stressed the
incompatibility of projected long term
fatality figures with statistics such as
deaths from travel accidents. He also
commented on the difference between
deaths from health hazards such as
smoking and those from Chernobyl,
in the case of smoking there was, he
said, an element of personal choice.
The Rector gave credit to Professor
ApSimon of the Nuclear Technology
section for assistance in preparing his
information.
Professor Ash then went on to
outline scenarios in which future
energy crises could lead to large scale
catastrophe. In particular he
expressed a fear that the continued
dependence of the West upon oil
could embroil it in a disastrous
escalation of Middle Eastern conflict.
He then discussed media and
emotional reaction to varying scales
of disaster.
Discussing the potential for future
energy sources Professor Ash argued
that nuclear fission was an important
option and said he believed it could
be made safe. Speaking about fusion
research the Rector said he couldn't
foresee any practical developments
until late in the next century. In
answer to a question he lamented the
low level of spending on alternative
energy research and said he believed
there were several very promising
ideas at an early stage, citing
photosynthesis processes being
developed at Imperial as a possible
'dark horse.'

Alarm calls in
Southside
Students in Southside were awoken by
the faulty alarm system at 11.30pm
on Sunday. The alarms rang
intermittently for twenty minutes,
until College Security turned the
system off.
Water leaks are believed to be the
original cause of the malfunction. The
transistors in the display panel were
also found to be completely burnt out.
This would have made it impossible
to locate a real fire. The panel was
repaired on Monday afternoon.
Recurrent false alarms in Southside
have resulted in generalised
indifference which may prove
dangerous in the event of a real fire,
a Southside Sub-warden said.
South African
cancels at LSE
Dr Denis Worrel, ex-South African
Ambassador, cancelled his proposed
appearance at LSE on Monday 2nd
February. The reason for his
cancellation is connected with his
resignation from the position of
Ambassador—he will be running as
an 'Independent' in the forthcoming
whites-only elections and as such can
hardly speak as a representative of the
Pretoria Government.
The debate, organised by LSE
Students Union "Open Debate
Forum" Society, was due to be
picketted by the Union, which also
proposed to disassociate the Debating
Club from the Union, and organise an
alternative meeting at the same time.
The President of the "Open Debate
Forum" fully intends to invite Dr
Worrel to speak on a future occasion.
JCR plans
delayed
The future of the JCR may not be
resolved for some time, following the
meeting of Union officers with
College administration on Thursday
of last week. After three and a half
days of a successful boycott of the QT
Burger Bar, College have asked IC
Union to come up with specific
proposals for the JCR. At today's
meeting of Finance and Executive,
one of the most powerful College
Committees, ICU Exec will be
proposing a long-term plan to build
a new JCR, together with a sports
hall. The Union's response to the
immediate problem of the JCR will
not be decided until Tuesday's Union
General Meeting.
College Deputy Secretary Brian
Lloyd Davies told FELIX that the
contractors would be continuing with
conversion work on the JCR until
March 15th. Over Easter they would
begin a general refurbishment of
Southside refectory.
Evelyn W
a
r
The College has put forward its bid
for the purchase of new
accommodation in Evelyn Gardens.
The residences consist of a unit of ten
houses, providing accommodation for
at least 200 students. If the bid is
accepted, the College should be ready
to meet the planned increase in
student numbers in October.
The value of Imperial's bid is
estimated at three to five million
pounds, but the College has refused
to give further details as this may
prejudice their chances against other
bidders.
