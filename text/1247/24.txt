Nobody expects the Boris inquisition. My chi ef weapon is fear -
fear and suprise and nobody was more suprised than I to find a
clue missing last week as many of you spotted. However, the num-
ber of you that still managed to guess the right answer (tumbler)
was quite incredible - give yourselves a pat on the back. The
entries are flooding in to the Felix office and coffee.felix@ic.ac.uk
and all correct entries will be entered into the grand prize draw at
the end of the year. But of course, you knew that already.
Peter Parkinson - DOC III is this week's winner and wins the
admiration of us all, but nothing really worth having I'm afraid.
The cryptic crossword device which I've decided to focus on this
week is the modest anagram. This can be indicated by just about
any word that implies change or something being wrong. Here's an
example:
Is Rob confused about my name? (5)
Would be 'Boris'. Keep sending in those answers...
