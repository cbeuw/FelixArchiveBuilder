Synopsis: Take some ordinary processed cheese slices (leave in wrap-
pers) and place in a red-hot barbeque. The first slice to inflate to its max-
imum volume is declared the winner - behold the art of (professional)
cheese racing.
Rating: Compared to Extreme Ironing, this sport is dilute in daring.
However, like all good games, this one is simple - requiring only two
pieces of equipment: a BBQ (preferably a disposable one) and n
processed cheese slices (where n is the number of players). A good hon-
est website, with plenty of information, history, instructions and most
importantly, pictures. Try this out for yourselves at your next BBQ.

to you."
"Well you burst on the scene, already a legend. The unwashed
phenomenon, the original vagabond."
"Life is a cigarette, smoked till the end!"
"Your rain on the top was short like leprechauns, as I crush so called
willies thugs and rapper dons. Get in that ass, quick fast, like
Rammadhan. It's that rap phenomenon "

dying...
...to put a little bit of sunshine in your life."
8. "Well let me welcome everybody to the wild wild west. The state
that's untouchable like Elliot Ness."
9. "Man what in the world is happening down at the end of the hall?
I don't have a clue, let's check this thing out!"
10. "With a few red lights an' a few old beds, we made a place to sweat.
No matter what we get out of this, I know...
...I know we'll never forget."
