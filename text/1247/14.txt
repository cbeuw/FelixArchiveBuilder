Lupine Howl
The Bar At The End Of The World
3/5
Imagine this : You're the lead
singer/songwriter in a band.
You've just released a hugely suc-
cessful and critically acclaimed
album and your band has played
an enormous tour, culminating in
a legendary performance at the
Royal Albert Hall. What do you do
next?
For Jason Pierce, the answer is
to sack the rest of your band
members and start again.
Incredibly for him, this didn't end
in disaster as Spiritualized fol-
lowed up with the wonderful Let It
Come Down which was voted by
XFM listeners as the best album of
2001, ahead of perennial
favourites Radiohead and Muse.
The sacked members mean-
while, decided to form their own
band. Starting in 2001 with the
half-decent The Carnivorous Lunar
Activities, their second offering
finds them in a rawer northern
soul guise.
The main guise that the tracks
here take are quiet verses making
way for a cannon of fuzz and riffs.
Opener A Grave To Go, emits a
blues vibe that John Spencer used
to do so well whereas Centre Of
The Universe sees an eerie back-
ing and anxious "Can't you feel
this?" whisperings morphing into
a tumultuous and commanding
reprise of "Come to me". Standout
track Burning Stars starts off as a
coffee table instrumental before
once again the bite kicks in,
recalling the swagger of Slide
Away by Oasis married to a men-
acing riff.
The most frustrating problem is
that the lead singer sounds as if
he's holding back his full vocal
range, and some songs are aching
to be let loose in a wave of sound
to turn them from ordinary rock
songs into widescreen epics. They
obviously want to get away from
Spiritualized comparisons
(although you wouldn't imagine
Pierce to be as tortuous a boss as
Mark E Smith), but surely it would
be best for them to go with their
instincts.
The likes of Muse, JJ72 and
The Music have shown that you
can produce big-sounding tunes
without sounding overbearing.
The tracks here that benefit from
that freedom only serve to show
how the other few could have
sounded. Gravity's Pull is an
example, a plaintive acoustic
strum-along with a strained coun-
trified drawl vocal which only
comes into its own after 5 minutes
when the orchestral sweep blows
in, finally treating the track to the
pomp it deserves. Overall, a
decent if unremarkable offering;
you somehow doubt that Jason
Pierce will be losing any sleep
over his decision. Deepesh
Safri Duo
Episode II - The Remix Edition
2/5
Hi, our name is Safri Duo, you
may remember us from such
illustrious second rate dance
tunes as Played Alive (The Bongo
Song) and well, that's all we've
done that has been in anyway
noteworthy really. What's that
you say, you don't remember us?
But we provided a tiny part of the
soundtrack to your cheesy Ibizan
hedonism a few summers ago,
we are the original purveyors of
comedy-bongo-Amazon i a n -
Ab(un)original house. How can
you have forgotten us already?
"Because you're shit!!", the world
cries back in unison.
It is no exaggeration to say that
The Bongo Song is absolutely the
best song on the entire album, If
you actually remember it then
you'll realize what a sad state of
affairs this is. Every song, and
that really means every song, not
just most songs, contains at least
one bongo solo, some contain
more and some others contain
nothing EXCEPT bongos. This
really should have been called
Played to Death (The Bongo
Album).
Amazingly for a "dance"
album, there are hardly any elec-
tronic effects anywhere, it is liter-
ally made up of bongos and other
various percussion instruments
(and a digeridoo, oh yes. If any-
one can tell me the last time a
digeridoo was heard on an album
NOT made by Rolf Harris they
deserve a prize). OK, they may
be synthesized but there are no
silly bleeps or blatant electronic
basslines. It does actually sound
like it was played in real life and
then just arranged digitally.
Which is quite disturbing actual-
ly because, judging from the
severely pained expression on the
face of the poor guy that played
them (as seen on the front cover),
he must have exploded about
half way through recording.
The album is just about saved
by a second CD of remixes by
people like Darude, Cosmic Gate
and Riva who manage to inject
some life into what are essential-
ly still-born songs, and move
some of them from half-arsed
bongo-house into what we'll call
plump-arsed techno-house terri-
tory. Some of it is quite good and
all of it is infinitely preferable to
the dirge on CD1.
Remember kids, playing too
much with your bongos can be
unhealthy! Dom

then, that this release includes
three live videos to give you a
taster.

Manic Street Preachers - There
by the Grace of God
There are some people who say
that the Manics haven't made a
decent record since Holy Bible,
and while these people are gen-
erally the hardcore fans they do
have a point. With chart per-
formance generally being
inversely proportional to a
bands artistic merits, it's no
surprise that the Manic's
biggest hits came from their
post-Bible material.
It's fitting then, that this went
top ten. Sounding like some-
thing that was scraped off the
sole of Nicky Wire's shoe after
they finished This Is My Truth,
you can't help but feel that they
needed some extra material to
help flog their new Greatest
Hits package. It reeks of sun-
shine and niceness and feels so
utterly PC it hurts. These are
things that the Manics just
aren't suited for. James
Bradfield needs things to rant
about and spit bile over.
Charming chiming guitars and
softly-softly drums just don't fit.
Richey would be spinning in his
grave.
