It might be a summer internship. It might last just eight to twelve weeks. But, for those prepared
to work hard, ask questions and show initiative, it's also a real job with real responsibilities that
offers an enormous learning opportunity. Whichever one of our business areas you join -
Investment Banking, Equities, Fixed Income or Information Technology - you'll benefit
from exposure to senior managers, needs based training and access to a sophisticated, open all
hours self-study centre. This, together with the chance to socialise with colleagues and fellow
interns, means you'll also discover if you'd like to work for us full-time. We look for undergraduates
who think creatively, spot opportunities and see beyond the obvious. It's an approach that's already
made us one of the largest investment banks in the world - and which will ultimately make us
number one. For more information and to apply, please click on www.csfb.com
To find out more about our summer internship opportunities, please come
to our presentation on Tuesday 12 November, 7:00pm at The UnderGlobe,
Exhibition Entrance, Globe Theatre, New Globe Walk, Southwark.
