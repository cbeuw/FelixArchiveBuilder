Careers Fair Success
The Union's Careers Fair took place
this week, where nearly 100 com-
panies tried to attract desirable
Imperial graduates.
Unfortunately, the weather on
Wednesday was miserable, but
over 2500 students passed
through the exhibits in the Union
building and in the marquee erect-
ed in Beit Quad. 2000 students are
expected on Thursday, after Felix
goes to press.
This year's fair was organised by
Michelle Lewthwaite, who said "I
feel it has been very successful,
and it seems that all the students
have enjoyed it."
The company representatives
also seemed positive about the fair,
which gave them a good opportu-
nity to advertise their graduate pro-
grammes and meet with their
future employees.
However, some students found
the experience a worrying reminder
that they'll soon be leaving univer-
sity, while another commented
"that man over there told me he

Weather failed to mar Careers Fair attendance
gets three hundred applications
each year, and they only have three
places!"
The changing employment mar-
ket is changing the way some com-
panies market themselves to grad-
uates. Specifically, some invest-
ment banks are running strong
campaigns this year to encourage
scientists and engineers to believe
that their degrees are not "irrele-
vant" or "wasted" on a career in
the city.
Ms Lewthwaite wanted to thank
all the Union staff and students
who made the day a success. AW
