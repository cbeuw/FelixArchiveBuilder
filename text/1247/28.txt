IC I 23 - 19 LSE I
Although the ginger content was
not as high this week, the IC
machine went marching on.
However, the closeness of the
game ensured that the 2's - after
a 67-0 drubbing of Chichester -
at last got their fair share of the
day's excitement. Mo's cyst and
the negative effect it had on
team moral could only be to
blame.
The game started with two
fantastic penalties from
Jonathan 1 went out with Ollie
last night' Spencer. However
before the half was out LSE,
wearing a thieved Saracens kit
took a narrow lead 7 - 6 after a
well worked try. As our main
academic competition in
London, the sin binning of their
no.8, due to his telling the Ref
to f**k off made the possibility
of a merger less appealing.
The game was all nip and tuck
throughout the second half, no
intended pun on Mo's intended
lancing of his baby-sized cyst.
Eventually, IC pulled clear
with a try from Duncan 'Never
shag your lab partner, your
grades aren't worth it'
Rutherford.
In conclusion, Alex James got
man-of-the-match after a ster-
ling performance in the backs.
Get in there quickly Virgins, his
looks are fading fast from the
constant punishment he keeps
getting.
Our Mr. Protherough had a
surprisingly quiet game - is it
the opposition or his new found
media coverage that is harming
his game? He's alright girls,
supposedly he wants a quiet one
tonight. The legend of Herpes
lives on!

UCL go down
IC III 4 - 3 UCL II
This was always going to be a
tough match for the newly pro-
moted thirds against title hope-
fuls UCL testing us to see if we
are in ULU Premier 2 just to
make up the numbers.
With perfect weather condi-
tions IC kicked off and started
brightly and were bold in their
attempts to get an early goal.
Before long we were rewarded
with a penalty as captain Henry
dribbled into the opposition box
and was clumsily fouled from
behind. Not having assigned a
penalty taker beforehand I
stepped up to take the penalty
myself but fired the ball straight
at the keeper who luckily parried
the ball to quick thinking Alex
de Luca who promptly dis-
patched the ball into the roof of
the net.
After absorbing long periods of
pressure during the remainder of
the first half, the score was still
one nil at half time.
Again IC pushed forward at
the start of the second half and
the score was made an unbe-
lievable 2-0 after Henry man-
aged to curl the ball from the
corner of the box into the oppo-
site top corner of the goal leav-
ing the keeper helpless.
Before long the thirds made it
3-0 when Anand finished a solo
effort by sliding the ball under
the advancing keeper but our
luck was to run out as UCL
changed formation and began to
force us back, while at the same
time beginning to lose their tem-
pers.
With only 10 minutes remain-
ing the score was 4-2 after a
succession of UCL corners and a
Gary 'thong boy' own goal but IC
managed just to hold on with
UCL hitting the bar twice in the
dying seconds of the game. The
final score was a memorable 4-
3 victory for IC thirds, especial-
ly with the impending merger of
the clubs.

IC II 67 - 0 Chichester
Following the disappointing start
to the season the 2nds
unleashed themselves on a
Chichester side at Harlington,
who could offer only token resist-
ance as Imperial rampaged to
victory.
Raphael 'The Frenchy' was
dominant throughout scoring an
unprecedented five tries from the
back row! However, Will 'Fancied
a 10 minute rest' Green, 2nd XV
Captain was sporadically incom-
petent and was banished to the
touchline for a possibly slightly
over exuberant tackle, which
stopped somewhere short of
assault but was something more
than touchy-feely behind the bike
shed. Adrien 'Spell my name with
an a' also turned up. Hamish 'Its
my birthday' threw up a lot.
IC II 22 - 16 ICSM
For the first time in the history of
IC rugby - we think - the seconds
demolished the supposed might
of the medics. Despite the thiev-
ery of "the unit" by the firsts
moments before kick off we got
off to a good start with Andy "I
hate being subbed" Nelson
checking out the view from under
their posts within five minutes.
Hard though they tried the
medics were unable to shackle
down our beloved Silvia. More
tries from Adrienne "the belly",
Will "can I play on the wing" and
Richard "what 1st team" Pivver
proved harder to stomach for the
medics than a good anal cist
(Mo). So once again Silvia
reigned victorious thanks to man
of the match Try Shy Tim Skirrow
and the awe that is our Gallic
back five. And in case I forgot to
mention, yes, we beat the
medics.
