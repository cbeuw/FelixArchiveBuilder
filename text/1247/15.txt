Live Review
ESP & 80's B-Line Matchbox Disaster
Q Awards Party, Camden Ding walls 2/5
It's the Q Awards Nominations
Party, and the room is filled with
people who think they've got a
vital role in today's music busi-
ness than they actually ever will
have. But still, they're the ones
who write about music and make
the small bands into the big
bands, so you'd think that the
two groups on show tonight
would make some effort at mak-
ing a good impression. You'd
think wrong.
Poor, poor Electric Soft
Parade, where did it all go so
wrong? Simple answer - the
beginning.
If it wasn't for the fact that half
the crowd consists of die-hard
ESP fans, the band could easily
have been mistaken for the latest
group on the local music circuit.
And not a particularly good one
at that. "It's such a chore playing
in London. We always end up
making you think we're dead...
or shit. Which we are - both,"
the lead singer explains to the
bewildered on-lookers. I wouldn't
argue with him.
"...And I don't feel I'm in con-
trol anymore," they sing out in
chart-hit There's A Silence - and
then the mic cuts. The band are
out of tune, the electronics
refuse to cooperate, and the
drummer's 'rock 'n' roll' frustra-
tion looks more like a spoilt
child's tantrum. When they are
together, the guitar sound rises
and rises to what should be an
incredible vocal climax - only it's
not. The beautiful sound that is
ESP's fine specimen of an
album, Holes In The Wall, and
which gave them a Mercury
Award nomination, just doesn't
appear tonight and ESP know it
all too well. As they charge off
the stage, muttering some
inaudible comment - could be an
apology, but more likely a curse -
their soon-to-be-wrecked drum
kit and guitar suffer the full blow
of their disappointment.
Our hearts rise with expectant
hope as the 80s Matchbox B-
Line Disaster members take up
their positions. Could they possi-
bly be the saviours of tonight's
dismal failure? I wish I could say
yes, I really do; I wish I could
write how their rock passion
inspired an energy in the crowd
unlike any other seen before. But
I can't.
Despite their fury-filled lyrics,
their strong yet geniusly-created
moments of guitar power, and
their delicate additions of sweet
electronica, the band still lack
that something that makes you
stare in disbelief - that rare abil-
ity to make you wish the night
would never end. Even when the
lanky-haired lead singer walks
confidently through the crowd,
screaming lyrics at random terri-
fied crowd-members, it only
makes us laugh, not ooh and ah
in wonder.
All in all, a night of dashed
hopes and disappointments.

5/5
With the rush of young bands
coming to the fore this year, it
means that JJ72 are left looking
like rock veterans, despite just
leaving their teens, and only
bringing out their second album.
If there was any doubt before,
then there is surely none now.
Mark Greaney with his Byronic
haircut and tweed jacket is the
spitting image of Crispian Mills.
Thankfully, Mark now shares
Crispian's tremendous energy
and stagepresence, coupled with
vocals that you either think
sound like the Chipmunks, or
are as graceful and majestic as
his idol Billy Corgan.
It is the doubters who are
proved wrong tonight, as he vol-
leys through a set, with a mix
from both albums, from the gen-
tle tones of Brother Sleep, to
the inevitably thunderous
Oxygen. Even forgetting the
words to Snow doesn't hinder
him, as the / to Sky tracks are
taken to heart by the crowd, just
as much as their glorious debut,
with Formulae and Glimmer in
particular instantly bringing
about huge cheers and waves of
pogoing.
The fact that Mark is so mes-
merising makes you forget how
good the other members are.
Fergal pounds the drums with
such menace that you must
think they need replacing after
each show, and Hilary is now
capable of killer baselines and
even a spot of singing on their
sumptuous David Essex cover.
The set ends with an unearth-
ly thrash, deadly enough to
bring on the apocalypse, before
we are treated to a moment of
comedy rock opera in the style
of their mates Muse.
Namely, Mark jumping up
onto the drum stand at the cli-
max of the show before falling
off backwards and continuing to
produce fits of distortion lying
on the floor, whilst the other
members just walk off. Proof, if
needed, that they do have a
sense of fun.
The greatest sin JJ72 can
commit is to be still playing in
small venues in a year's time.

Singles
Paul Heaton
Couple
The Perfect
Perhaps drugs, bludgeoning or
oxygen starvation would explain
the camp tunes Paul Heaton
has become famous for. The
maestro from Hull seems intent
on transmitting the worst kind
of musical torment via trash
such as The Perfect Couple.
The sickly sugared melodies
hammer at the head whilst
simultaneously hoisting out the
contents of the gut. The tune is
disgusting, the lyrics are more
so and instruments seemed to
have been recorded perfectly to
transfer straight to the musak
version. To be fair there was
never much to expect; Paul
Heaton has released nothing
remotely respectable in the last
ten years .
I'm sure there is a market for
this music, in the realms of bad
taste of cheap karaoke. I would
go as far as saying this is
maybe the most widely sold
song in the seedy pubs of Hull,
where it is the fashion for the
damned to drink themselves to
death under the terrible sounds
of Heaton. Unless the
masochist in you needs the
pain, give this song an extreme-
ly large berth.
0/5 Sachit
Idlewild - Live In A Hidii
Place
Live in a Hiding Place is th
third song to be taken from
Idlewild's album The Remote
Part. From Woody Roomble's
articulate vocals to the mellow,
but infectious guitar, this song
is up there with some of the
best from greats like REM. A
world apart from the raw sound
of Captain, but highly recom-
mended all the same. Let's just
hope Alex Grant will be able to
continue where Bob Fairfoul
(ex-bassist) left off.
