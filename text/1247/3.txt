I'm sure Imperial could sort out all
its financial difficulties if it just
replaced the optician's on the walk-
way with an off-licence. Lack of
spectacles and alcohol-induced
bleariness might mean a small
investment in replacing the library's
textbooks with large-print copies,
but it would mean no top-up fees -
and, regardless of background, stu-
dents will all still have exactly the
same opportunities to come to uni-
versity. And get completely ratted.
Probably because alcohol has
destroyed my memory, I don't
remember at what age I started
drinking, but it was probably quite
young. Some people think targeting
alcopops at children is morally
wrong, but I disagree - the more
kids we have lying unconscious in
gutters, or in hospital beds under-
going liver transplants, the less of
the little bastards we have taking up
all the space in McDonalds. If
they're spending money on alcohol,
they won't be spending it in HMV,
and perhaps that will mean the
charts will be free of S-Club Juniors.
So, we should be promoting alcohol
more heavily to the under-16's.
There could be an advertising cam-
paign like that badly dubbed Kinder
Egg advert of several years ago...

The Scene: A
Supermarket. A
woman is standing
in the drinks aisle
with her three dis-
gusting children.
Woman: Right, shut up, and I
you something.
Precocious Child 1: I'm hyperactive
and thirsty - I want a drink full of
artificial colourings!
Irritating Child 2: I'm too happy - I
want a natural depressant!
Ugly Child 3: And I want a surprise!
Woman: Artificial colourings, a nat-
Booze!
ural depressant... and a surprise...
all in one... it's not possible... it's
not possible...
Announcer: NEW VODKA SUNNY
DELIGHT!
Woman: What a good idea! There
you go kids.
Children: Yay!
Ugly Child 3: But where's the sur-
prise?
Woman: The sur-
prise is that I
haven't given you a
good wallop for
being so bloody
impertinent.
What a rubbish sur-
Ugly Child 3
prise.
Woman: OK then - you were adopt-
ed. Surprise!
Getting kids into drinking also
means that they should be well
prepared for university life. Students
would come to Imperial with a
greater alcohol tolerance, which
can only mean more money into the
college coffers. And perhaps we'd
see less vomiting in the union.
What better way to finish a fun
night out than with your arms
around a toilet bowl, retching so
hard you can almost see your own
intestines? While feeding your new
ceramic friend your previous meal,
you can find yourself asking ques-
tions - like, was there ever a man
called Armitage Shanks? What is
the Ideal Standard? All that graffiti
on the cubicle wall - just why did all
these people take a pen into the toi-
let? Why isn't Kimberley Clark
among the 100 Greatest Britons?
Just think, if it wasn't for our Kim,
you'd have nothing to clean the sick
off your jeans with, except perhaps
for spare copies of Felix. Now, this
column may be full of bile, but I
don't want to see bits of sweetcorn
in it as well. Alex Warren
