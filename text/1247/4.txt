In My Opinion
F E L I X
Behind the Goldsmith Wing of the
Royal School of Mines building, a
rather large gold mine is growing,
and not the kind us geologists are
familiar with...
The growing heap consists of
computers, monitors, wooden
desks, chairs, display cupboards,
journals and the odd microscopes
plus much more. Scavengers
come regularly to the site and
some say they have found equip-
ment worth thousands of pounds.
Many of the cupboards and equip-
ment thrown away are just simply
not produced these days and are
worth a fortune, an antique (bring
down the roadshow I say)!
So what's going on? Intrigued I
put on my detective hat, lit my
pipe and went to meet Alan Jones,
estates and building manager for
the RSM project. In a nutshell:
"Over the next year, the RSM is
going to be refurbished, with the
Department of Earth Science and
Engineering moving into the Aston
Webb building, Department of
Materials moving into the
Goldsmith Wing and Department
of Environmental Science and
Technology moving to the top
floor" - all very neat.
This has all been triggered by
all the equipment - using my
extensive deduction skills; not a
long time.
It would seem that Departments
have been going through the vari-
the development of the Tanaka
Business School which is using
most of the Goldsmith Wing. In
fact this section was handed over
to estates last Wednesday, giving
only until this Monday to clear out
ous rooms since July, picking out
things they want to keep and re-
storing them, for example rock
specimens. However it seems
crazy I said that no-one was
employed to help sell the waste -
it's worth a fortune or indeed
donate it to charity. However Alan
Jones pointed out clearly that
"although everyone has done their
best to salvage antique items
there is just simply a lack of space
to store things and a lack of time
to go through the waste properly".
So what can I say? Well I got my
trolley out and now the RSM CSC
have a vintage and very classy fil-
ing cabinet (with filing folders!)
which will be used for achieves, a
new seismograph mascot and
some old student files from the
50s. If you fancy a new chair, fil-
ing cabinet or even a hard drive
then come and grab it! I have
been informed that everyone is
welcome to the rubbish pile.
What I want to know, is for a
university claiming to be short of
money - why it is allowing so
much money to be thrown away?
A case once again for a lack of
administration, organisation and
time? I'd like to see the balance
sheet for this one...
