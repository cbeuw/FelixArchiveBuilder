Lecturers To Strike
In a ballot of its members (Felix 1243), the
Association of University Teachers has voted
75% in favour of a strike this Thursday.
The AUT are protesting about the 'London
weighting', the extra money awarded to uni-
versity staff working in London to offset the
higher cost of living. The allowance stands at
£2134, but has remained fixed since 1992.
Meanwhile, claim the AUT, London vice-
chancellors enjoy £16,000 extra per year
over their counterparts outside the capital.
The unions rejected a 3.5% salary increase
offer, and are instead campaigning for an
allowance of £4000.
Several other staff unions - NATFHE,
Amicus and Unison - have also called on
their members to strike on 14th November.
The number of lecturers to walk out is
unclear, but technical and administrative
staff both in College and the students' union
are also covered by the call to strike.
The National Union of Students (NUS) and
Will lecture theatres stand empty?
University of London Union (ULU) are both
publically supporting the action, with the
London weighting for student funding one of
ULU's main campaigns. It is hoped that any
movement on the weighting for staff may
highlight the additional cost to students tak-
ing courses in London. Meanwhile, the AUT
explicitly states that the association aims not
"to adversely affect students" with its strike
action.
It is thought that some critical College staff
may be involved in the strike action including
security officers. Head of Security Ken Weir is
hoping to obtain permission for his staff to
disregard the call to strike in order to provide
fire and security cover, though he acknowl-
edged that he had no way of knowing how
many of his staff were in the appropriate
unions or were planning to strike.
Union President Sen Ganesh said he was
"deeply concerned" that teaching and Union
activities may be disrupted by the strike, but
as with the rest of College, there seems to be
much uncertainty about the number of staff
to walk out next week.
The AUT has stated that the strike may still
be averted if employers negotiate. AW
Union Shutdown
The Union building in South
Kensington will be largely evacu-
ated on Saturday as a result of
the Remembrance Day events at
the Royal Albert Hall.
The annual ceremony in
remembrance of those from the
armed forces who died in action,
including the two world wars, is
attended by the Queen and other
members of the royal family. The
Union building in Beit
Quadrangle is usually closed
when royals attend the hall in
order to stage counter-terrorism
measures. Prince Consort Road
and Kensington Gore will also
close, while nearby residences
are closely monitored. In the
past, parked cars and even
chained-up bikes have been
removed by police as they may
conceal "hostile devices".
While police will occupy the
roof of the Beit building, they will
not be armed, according to
College's Head of Security Ken
Weir.
Student activities in the Union
basements will be unaffected and
the bars will be open as usual.
