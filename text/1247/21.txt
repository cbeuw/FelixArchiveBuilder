He he! Now is the time for us all to admit that
we enjoy Harry Potter even if it is written for 9
- 11 year olds. I've seen men in smart suits
with briefcases sitting on the tube totally
engrossed and I'm sure I'm not the only wit-
ness. This website is fun; you can enter as a
muggle or as a witch/wizard and you get a dif-
ferent site. Other than the standard options
that you would expect from a Bloomsbury site
- introduction to Harry Potter, order the books,
reviews, biography, there are some more inter-
esting added extras. If you enter as a muggle
there is a glossary of all the terms used in the
series, including all the spells used.
Aparecium! Hmm, didn't work. But I think it is
better to enter as a witch/wizard, although
there is a test before you can enter - there is
password you have to guess, don't worry it
shouldn't tax your brains too much but I won't
spoil your fun and tell you what it is. As a
witch/wizard there is a Screensaver to down-
load (for Macs or PCs), it may take a little time
with an ordinary connection and it's not exact-
ly a high tech piece of artwork but fun nonethe-
less. However, my favourite extra is that you
can send howlers. These range from 'You
Slytherin toad rat' to 'Do your homework and
tidy your room'. You email them to anyone you
like or don't, as the case may be. There are
also owlers, which are nice, including 'happy
birthday' and 'my friend fancies you'!
Anyway, with the new book and new film
out soon, maybe it's time for you all to brush
up on your magic speak.

A website for anyone who enjoys art, photog-
raphy or museums, or is perhaps travelling and
feels they should do something vaguely educa-
tional while they are there. A comprehensive
site of art/photography galleries and museums
worldwide, from our very own, lovely Great
Britain, to Israel or Australia. This does not just
cover the straightforward traditional galleries
either, there is information on one man in Tel
Aviv who produces pictures and sculptures
using meat, liver, blood and dead bugs. Well
it's better than freezing them and covering
them in chocolate (see Felix 1245 if you're
lost).
This site would also be useful for anyone
looking for an interesting picture because there
are quite a few rather gorgeous photographs
and art pieces that can be saved. I, for one,
have picked up a new background for my desk-
top that is much nicer than the ones that
Microsoft provides.
There is only one slight problem with this
site. Sure, it is straightforward to use - divided
into countries, easy to track down specific
information and easy to browse. But, half of it
is in French. Now you are intelligent people
and as such I can't believe that will be much of
a problem.
So if you like to find out about art galleries
and photography exhibitions anywhere in the
world or maybe just want a new background I
would suggest having a quick nosey around
here.
It's a bit too orange really (trust me it is). I
prefer kiwis or mangoes but not lychees.

Network
Imperial has one, my friends have one in
their house, in fact, I'm beginning to think
these things are pretty darn useful. Two or
more computers linked together. Not a com-
prehensive definition but it works. There are
three ways to link computers in common
usage; bus, star and ring.
As if just being a network isn't enough,
there are many different types. In Local-Area
Networks the computers are geographically
close, whereas in Wide-Area Networks they
are further apart. Other types include
Campus-Area, Metropolitan-Area and Home-
Area Networks.
Calling all budding journalists.
Since my coursework is now starting to
mount up I could really do with a little help
writing the best web site review page the
world has ever seen. Or at least getting
something (anything) printed each week.
So please don't all step back at once, just
think how good it will look on your CV, how
much fulfilment you will get from seeing your
words in print, and other such inspiring stuff.
Get off your butts and do something before I
fail my final year.

Hello people, hope everyone is hunky dorey.
This is the week of the great, the almighty,
the fantastically stupendous Harry Potter
and the Chamber of Secrets, or something
like that. So I suggest everyone surf over to
meet him at Bloomsbury's web site.
If, however, you would prefer something a lit-
tle more intellectual than children's books
artmag seems to be really quite thorough.
Please realise that I accept no responsibility
for the actual existence of the galleries men-
tioned here since I have not quite been able
to make it to all of them. Have a stunningly
stunning week, gorgeous folk. Jenny
