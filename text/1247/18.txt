HORN
This is a relaxing easy read, with
captivating characters and a story-
line that bounces along to the end.
Essentially it is story of a married
couple entering a joint mid life cri-
sis, Kate finds herself having an
affair and David has a complete
personality transplant. The title is a
result of the conscience struggle
that Kate has - is she a good per-
son? As a GP she considers her
work to be 'good', she believes that
she is a 'good' mother and when
she compares herself to the original
David she can believe herself to be
How to be Good
Nick Hornby
a complete saint. But why then is
she having an affair and risking it
all? David is an embittered, cynical
individual who delights in hating
everyone and everything. His
favourite hobby, though, is irritating
Kate, and in one of his many
attempts to annoy her he goes to
get his bad back treated, but not by
a certified practitioner. He finds a
small sign indicating that bad
backs could be sorted out in one
session for a single fee. David does-
n't believe that it will work but he
does know it will wind Kate up. He
is more than a little surprised when
he meets the healer, a man calling
himself DJ GoodNews, and returns
with his back healed after years of
pain.
DJ GoodNews is someone whom
we would all like to know for nov-
elty value, but at a distance, quite
a large distance. His crazy ideas on
how to be good completely alter
David's outlook on life and result in
a number of bizarre schemes to
improve the lives of those in the
local community. Whilst David
undergoes total character alteration
Kate is left wondering where she
went wrong, she knows for definite
that her life is going completely off
the rails when she ends up pre-
tending to live at home for her chil-
dren's benefit but actually living in
a friends flat. She arrives before the
children get up and leaves after
they go to bed, despite this being
exhausting and a little silly, she
really enjoys the time to herself.
This is a rather different
approach to the breakdown of mar-
riage, as well as a study on what
'good' really means. Is anyone real-
ly 'good'? Probably not, we all do
things for selfish reasons from time
to time.

man and boy
Tony Parsons has really excelled
himself with this book, a tender
picture of the love between father
and son. He studies the relation-
ship from both sides and the result
is a set of characters that you learn
to love yourself. Now, I'm not the
crying sort but with this book I
found the odd tear making its way
down my cheek: Parsons manages
to capture love and put it on the
page in a way that I've not seen
before.
Harry's father is a hero, a war
hero and he's got the medal to
prove it, but he is also the sweet-
Man and Boy
Tony Parsons
est most gentle man you can imag-
ine. Harry admires him and yet he
is also intimidated by him, he
wants his own son to respect him
in the same way but knows it will
never happen because Harry and
his father are very different. This is
not just about paternal love.
Parsons compares the love of his
sweetheart, his wife, with the
physical love with Siobhan, his
one night stand and eventually
with the love between two people
who are really right for each other.
Written in first person, this novel
begins with an idealistic impres-
sion of his life, married to the love
of his life with a child, whom they
both adore. But there are cracks in
this perfection and they culminate
with a one night fling on his part
which destroys their relationship.
His wife, Gina, gave up a high fly-
ing career in Japan as a translator
in order to marry him and bring up
his son, but with his one night
stand she totally loses faith in the
relationship and returns to Japan.
This leaves Harry to bring up his
son and he stumbles from one diffi-
culty to another. By this point he
has lost his job so is also increas-
ingly faced with financial problems.
This novel is not all unhappiness,
worries and complications, it has a
sharp, witty tone that provides
chuckles throughout as a welcome
relief from the intensity of the story
line. All in all, this novel thoroughly
deserves the attention and praise it
has received and is certainly one
that I recommend, I just hope that
Man and Wife and One For My
Baby are as good, otherwise I'm
about to waste my money.
