Picture the scene: it's
Halloween, the middle of the
night, the wind is whistling
through the trees, the shadows
are dancing and Minna wants
chocolate. It doesn't get much
more scary. But why is it in a
sports report?
The night started off normally
enough; most of the team, tired
and hungry, stood outside the
Union waiting for Gavin, our
ever-punctual captain. We were
about to embark on the first leg
of our quest for mixed doubles
glory against the might of Royal
Holloway. Amazingly, despite a
distinct lack of preparedness
and going against all past
records, we arrived early for the
match, and could have carried
out a proper warm-up. Could
have. Instead, I digested my
large Burger King meal, Minna
headed for the vending
machines and Gavin chatted up
the opposite team's captain.
And so to the match. Royal
Holloway had only managed to
secure two courts, the other half
of the gym being occupied by
scary people in black suits doing
what looked like an elaborate
form of the Hokey Kokey. This
arrangement left me - a a lowly
third coupler - free to watch the
first two matches. On paper,
these should have been the best
two matches - first vs. first and
second vs. second. They didn't
disappoint. The girl in the Royal
Holloway first couple was the
best female we've ever seen play
in a ULU league - quick, strong
and clever, and she added enter-
tainment value by abusing her-
self in a variety of languages.
Despite being up against super-
woman, our first couple, Minna
and Kee, managed to pull
through three hard games,
showing excellent resilience and
determination having lost the
first one. Watching this game I
suddenly realised how mixed
doubles should be played. Now,
if only I could do it.
Unfortunately, on the other court
Belinda and Chan struggled
against the second couple, and
lost two hard-fought games.
Gavin and I then continued
this losing streak by losing to the
third couple, mainly due to my
inability to serve and Gavin's
inability to hit anything in the
court. But he had just had his
racquet re-strung, so we might
let him off. Meanwhile, Minna
and Kee demonstrated their
superiority by polishing off the
third couple without even break-
ing sweat and Belinda and Chan
couldn't overcome superwoman.
So Royal Holloway were 3-2 up
with four games to play. Onto
court stepped Gavin and I, the
antithesis of the ideal doubles
team, desperately needing to
beat their second couple. It was
a match to end all matches. One
member from each team was
severely handicapped by the
temporary loss of one ankle and
I earned myself the incongruous
nickname Miss Whiplash - I'm a
good girl, I am - due to a
propensity for whacking my leg
quite hard with my racquet,
whenever I arsed something up,
which was quite often. Yes, I
still have the bruises. No, you
can't see them. Anyway, we
managed to come out on top
and needed to win two of the
last three to win the match.
Obviously, Minna and Kee won
with the minimum of bother.
Equally obviously, Gavin and I
didn't even get a point against
their number ones. And so it
came down to Belinda and
Chan. They'd managed to cream
the RH pair in the first game,
15-2, and we all waited expec-
tantly for them to wrap up the
match. Unsurprisingly, they did-
n't. Well, not straight away. In
keeping with the night's sense of
drama and excitement, they did-
n't win it until 17-15 in the
third. A truly stunning victory,
especially considering the added
pressure of everyone watching,
and it being after 11pm.
Our departure from Royal
Holloway was slightly delayed
by Gavin's ineptitude in getting
dressed - well, he's more used to
the other way round. This paled
into insignificance though com-
pared to the delay caused by
being locked in the car park.
Everyone else had disappeared,
and we were confronted by a big
gate with an extremely large
padlock. We thought about ram-
raiding it, but then reconsidered
at the thought of the already
dilapidated state of the Union
minibus fleet. So off set Gavin
and I, through the woods of
Egham, trying to find security.
When we eventually found
them, we were further delayed
by their disbelief that such a
thing could happen, and by the
security guard's insistence that I
should celebrate Celtic's victory
over Blackburn with him, just
because I happened to ask the
result with a vaguely Scottish
accent. It shames me even now.
With our knight in shining
armour on the way, we headed
back to the minibus to wait for
our liberation. Finally the guard
came and opened the gate. And,
of course, the bus wouldn't
start. And when it did, and we
were on our way, inevitably, the
M4 was closed. So the tubes
had stopped and everyone had
to be dropped at their door. The
last of us got home at 2am. I'm
tired just writing about it. But
we won. Hurrah. Sarah
