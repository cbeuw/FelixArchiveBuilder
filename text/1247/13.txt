The Datsuns
The Datsuns
4 / 5
Brilliant new rock band from
New Zealand, following the lead
of fellow Australasian rock band
"The Vines". The Datsuns though
are less thrashy, with more of a
Led Zeppelin feel to them. This
punchy debut album is high
octane stuff. The first tune on the
self titled album Sittin' Pretty
borrows heavily from a Lenny
Kravitz riff, which is okay with
me because it's a catchy guitar
lead rock tune.
The next two tunes, MF From
Hell (The M rhymes with brother
and the F with tucker) and Lady
are also fast paced, vivacious, in
your face tunes without let up.
Just by listening to them, the
amount of energy they inject into
their music exhaust you. What
Would I Know, track five, is prob-
ably my favourite on the album,
reminiscent of Black Rebel
Motorcycle Club, a tune that
gathers strength as it marches on
playing out for over 5 minutes,
which is time thoroughly well
spent.
The next track is their recently
released single that reached No.
25 in the UK singles chart, In
Love, a quality tune and one of
the best on the album with
catchy lyrics and good back-
ground singing. Though that was
the single released, there are oth-
ers on the album that could easi-
ly have been singles, being of the
same style and quality.
The Datsuns have just finished
their UK tour, and that's a pity,
because if they play live anything
half as good as it is in here, then
it should be a brilliant gig. Look
out, The Datsuns have arrived!

Twice as Nice Presents MOBO 2002
2/5
\ 4
This CD needs no explanation for,
it's an amalgamation of tracks
selected from the nominees at
the 2002 MOBO awards, a selec-
tion from the cream of young
urban talent. Talent being the
operative word, after listening to
this CD I would not want to know
how young urban mediocre
sounds, as this album turned out
to be a major disappointment.
'How can you complain?' I hear
you say. 'There's Ashanti,
Beverley Knight and Missy Elliot
on there, not to mention the
Sugababes and The Streets'. I'm
sorry to tell you this, but the
presence of respected, talented
artists on the compilation does
nothing to lessen the impact of
some shockingly bad, insipid
nonsense that crops up at regular
intervals. And precisely which
tracks are that bad, well let's
start with the first disc.
Disc One starts off with what is
primarily competent, relatively
mainstream RnB. Think MC
Romeo of permanently topless
disposition, and his lyrically-chal-
lenged Romeo Dunn, along with
Miss Dynamite's brassy funk
sing-along It Takes More. This is
what I call talent. The opening
tracks are strong and well put
together. Steve Sutherland's mix-
ing makes this the perfect party
CD as the tracks blend seamless-
ly into one another.
Top tracks include newcomers
Big Bruvaz and the mindless, yet
catchy Nu Flow, the permanently
cold (is it just me or do they
never seem to wear any clothes,
just underwear?) Liberty X with
Gof to Have Your Love and the
fabulous Black Twang rap on the
funky Trixstar. Another highlight,
the groovy What's Luv from
Ashanti and Fat Joe, and the
bhangra remix of Misteeq's Roll
On. The tunes are not new, that's
for certain, as this is a set of
what are supposedly the highs of
the last year.
The dirge begins here. We have
numerous pointless remixes of
what were essentially good
songs, e.g. Oh Baby by Rhianna
and Fallin' by Alicia Keys, where
beats detract from the melody of
the original pieces. There are
then some genuinely awful
songs, which can't really be
called songs because there are
minimal musical merits in them,
and you can't dance to them
without looking like a deformed
chicken. These include 3rd Edge
and the sleazy slime Keith Sweat
- with / Want You as well as
Lurine Cato Feat. Royalty's We'll
Get Thru It and Trina's No
Panties. And the second disc is
by far the lamest CD on sale in
the shops, with only Daniel
Bedingfield holding the flag of
good taste. The garage section is
particularly inaccessible - if you
can't rap along, or dance to it, it's
got to be a bad thing on a party
CD right?

Vanessa Carlton
Day
Ordinar
This is the follow up song
the very good A Thousa,
| Miles, y'know the piano play-
ing woman travelling on the
back of a lorry. Ordinary Day
doesn't really digress from the
same format. There is still
plenty of piano playing with
very powerful string accompa-
niment. It's a bit of a cheesy
song about following dreams
it's got plenty of energy
ingability factor is high,
side note, has anyone
seen Michelle Branch and
Vanessa Carlton in the same
room together? I swear they
could be the same person.
4/5 Oscar
Sugababes - Stronger/Angels
with Dirty Faces
The Sugababes are not as fit
as their poppier rivals Atomic
Kitten but they make better
music. Now we've got that out
the way, let's talk music. This
ouble A-side will do them no
at all. Both songs are
t girl power but are a lot
more street about it as
opposed to the long forgotten
Spice Girls. Stronger is a stan-
dard pop ballad, slow with a
singable chorus and good har-
onies. There's the standard
bit where she wails a bit
Round Round. However
.ong doesn't really know
to end, with just
fading away.
Angels with Dirty Faces
much more upbeat. Then
more of the rap/singing thi
that's heard frequently in thi:
irand of pop. A heavily pro-
track which I think is
of an album track, it's
bit too forgettable. These
o songs aren't as good as
their previous singles but
they're doing well.
