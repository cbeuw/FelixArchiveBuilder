other nights
To my everlasting shame I very
nearly left " Tonight" during its
opening week seven years ago. I
can remember standing in a pub
in Kensington High Street and
telling the then Editor, Donald
Baverst ck, that I didn't think
much of the programme or its
chances of survival. What's more
it didn't seem to be the pro-
gramme which I could really
enjoy doing ni«ht after night.
He persuaded me to stay for
" a little while until it settles
down."
That "little while" has been
seven years and in that time we
have produced over 1,500 pro-
grammes, filling almost 1,000
hours of television time, and we
have had something in the region
of ten thousand people in the
studio.
We have presented the pro-
It would be idle to pretend that
I have enjoyed every one of the
programmes. On occasions I
have been really terrifiiid, and
none more so than when we had
the " snake man " C. P. J. Ionides
in the studio with some of his
venomous friends. He had them
all in linen bags and we squatted
on the floor with a few feet be-
tween us in which he was to show
them off. On his head Ionides
wore his battered old felt hat—
" it's got enough dried venom in
there to kill an army."
One by one he produced the
snakes, a Gaboon Viper, the spit-
ting cobra and aquatic snakes
which he had caught by night in
the light of pressure lamps. By
the side of the camera a man was
standing with a syringe at the
ready. As one snake took the
place of another on that square
gramme from Copennagen, Ve-
nice, Brussels, Geneva and Edin-
burgh and when the BBC electri-
cians had a difference of opinion
with the management I presented
it from a fire escape outside the
studio. Our reporters have visited
every continent and almost every
country in the world.
So much for my programme
judgement in 1957. My assess-
ment failed in its measurement of
the abilities of the team of young
producers who are today the best
in the business.
of floor between us so the man
with the syringe changed the
serum. It comforted me not one
bit espcially when Ionides looked
at me then at the syringe man and
said this snake killed the world's
greatest herpetologist and there is
no serum known which can help
you if it does happen \d catch you.
I moved back.
And then came the biggest
fright of all, when I asked Ionides
to demonstrate how he bagged a
snake with his hat.

M I C H E L M O R E
" It's easy really" he said
standing—instinctively I stood—
and a split second later he drop-
ped a viper at my feet. I took off
quicker than any astronaut and ;>o
did two of the cameramen. I
turned to look at Ionides. There
writhing with its head buried deep
in the piece of crumpled felt was
the viper. The snake man smiled
sympathetically. " You are right
to be apprehensive. I should have
warned you!"
If that was the most frightening
experience I have had on " To-
night " let me tell you some more
of the mosts.
The Most Disturbing . . .
Jayne Mansfield in a leopard-
skin dress which hugged her so
tight that she could neither walk
nor sit. Geoffrey Johnson-Smith
blushingly helped her into a loung-
ing position.
The Most Surprising
James Mason, allegedly the en-
fant terrible of the film business—
charming, helpful, outspoken and
so nice.
The Most Honest
The then Lord Hailsham in
an interview in which he coined
the phrase " unflappability " say-
ing of himself "I really must learn
not to be so pompous in future."
The Most Wittily Expensive
Millionaire Nuban Gulbenkian
showing us his specially built
private London taxi—gold plated
of course—" I'm told it can turn
on a sixpence, whatever a six-
pence may be."
The Most Beautiful
Dawn Addams in black and
diamonds and Sophia Loren in a
sheath of shimmering gold..
The Least Likely to be Asked
Again
The young Norfolk boy who
brought his pet pig, saying that it
was well house-trained. To our
cost we discovered it wasn't.
The Least Likely to Come Again
June Havoc, who refused to
appear because we wanted to
mention her early life struggle
and show a picture of her stripper
sister—Gipsy Rose Lee.
The People I Would Most Like
to Come Again
Kenneth More, David Niven,
Gene Kelly, Bob Hope, Dame
Edith Sitwell, Geraldinn McEwan,
Noelle Adam, Harry Secombe
and dozens more!
In the next seven years I have
no doubt that" Tonight" will add
to this list. Yes, I really do
think that even if I'm not with it,
and that is more than likely—
" Tonight" in some form or
another will be on your screen
and someone will be saying " The
next' Tonight' will be tomorrow
night. Goodnight."
THEN AS
N O W • •• •
Felix, christened by F. C.
Ewels, began its first life more as
a school magazine than the news-
paper it is now. This amateurism
was at once put down to the fact
that the days of unrationed milk
were still to come.
The first Editorial stated the
need for a frequently published
journal, insisted that Felix would
not devour Phoenix (despite their
" animal connections") and
pointed out that copies for one
term cost less than a pint—which
they still do!
CORRESPONDENCE
A glance at the first correspon-
dence page should suffice to con-
vince any would-be complainants
of the futility of it all—moans
about College " hops" from
" Wallflower " and " this strange
body of men who apparently find
it necessary to operate pneumatic
drills at the ungodly hour of
7.30 a.m " and this;
Dear Sir,
In a mild sort of way I would
like to register a bitter protest
about the Union beer.
Perhaps one of our own tame
entomologists could recommend
to our so called brewers a more
virile type of Gnat.
Yours etc.,
Ulcerated.
Have wallflower and Ulcerated
done any good?
F E L I X SOBERS UP
Felix ended its first life with
the publication of this " com-
ment "—" When are you going to
squeeze the bear out of Felix?"
It was said that previous isues had
merely been " concatenations of
accounts of bibulation."
This was too much and after
again blaming the scarcity of
milk, Felix sobered up. From
time to time it has tried to do the
same thing for others (not to men-
tion a certain student organisa-
tion which is not in the N.U.S.)
In the first fifty issues, Felix has
successfully steam-rollered the
two cultures -into one to produce
a scientific report on " Splitting
the Infinitive," a Chaucerian Lab.
Report, Mathematician's Court-
ship and many other literary
gems. Where are all these " Moni-
tor here I come " people now?
F E L I X T H E INFORMER
Always appalled at ignorance,
Felix has acted the informer on
many College topics:
BO
(when referred to as " she ")—
Boanerges, meaning " Sons of
Fury " or " Sons of Thunder "
was the name given to the sons
of Zebedee and later by T. E.
Lawrence to one of his motor
cycles.
BROWN BAGGER — ORIGIN
(when it was claimed to be in
use at U.C. in 1925). " The term
appears in a Phoenix of 1918 . . .
also in one of H.G.Wells' books."
