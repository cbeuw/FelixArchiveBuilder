SPORT A N D T H O U G H T
This year marks a very important stage in the development and
future of Guilds. Most of the engineering departments have been
relocated in new buildings, and many of the students have taken up
residence in the Southside Halls. Soon there will be well over 2,000
students in Guilds, and of these, over half will be postgraduates.
There is already a change in Guilds-feeling, which has showed itself
in the various attitudes of the expanding numbers of " Active-Guilds-
men." Matters of importance are being dealt with on the Guilds
Union floor, and attempts are being made to integrate the Sport and
Thought elements of Guilds Life, so that the two can co-exist without
unbalance. The beer mug has gone back on the shelf, but it is still
an element in Guilds Union life as a social integrator. See a friend
over the rim, even if the post is full of orange.
Freshers Dinners
The Freshers' Dinners of old
were not the* best way of intro-
ducing student to staff. The more
ordered dinners this year were a
little nearer the formula needed.
The loss of Spanner showed how
Southside opening has bolstered
Guilds spirit in the resident
Guildsman. The ring of twenty
chairs awaiting telephoned pro-
gress reports; the ring of coffee
cup stain on a broken cipher
clue ; the code solving on depart-
mental blackboards; the loaded
cars to remote destinations . . .
and Dartmoor. Morphy Day was
a mess due to lack of liaison be-
tween the other constituent col-
leges. Almost all the organisa-
tion was left to Guilds, but we
did not receive the assistance of
the others, and so chaos reigned
for a short while. R.C.S. and
Mines did not have the slightest
idea as to what was happening.
They were unprepared, and were
it not for the Loudhailer that
Guilds hired, the return journey
would have been a disaster.
Pedal Car Race
An indication of the " Go " in
Guilds was given by the carol
singing collection. Over £100
was collected in under four
hours. £25 was raised for the
Mental Health campaign by auc-
tioning a car. Newly formed
groups of Guildsmen are doing
new things. The Bristol pedal
car race will see the result of the
labours of one such group, in the
newly designed pedal cars being
built by mechanical engineering
students. The Radio Society is
showing great enterprise in the
television broadcasting system
that they are developing around
the television camera that was
given them by I.T.A.
Not Theatrical Performances
The various Engineering soc-
ieties have very varied pro-
grammes set out for the session,
but often bad publicity for these
events lets them down. Mid-day
Eng. Soc. meetings are an inno-
vation this year, but the Faber
Prize even has been poor, there
being only one entry by the clos-
ing date. The Guilds Aeronau-
tical Engineering Society has
been formed this year for Aero-
nautical students, and they are
already organising a Seminar in
this College for European Stu-
dents, to take place this summer.
In the past, Union meetings
have played to packed houses.
This is wrong. Union meetings
should not be theatrical perform-
ances, they should be a forum for
student discussion from the floor,
and a means of communicating
details of Union activities to the
standard Guildsman. These may
be put over in a lively way, but it
should be possible for serious de-
bate to take place without a
monster explosion, or a barrage
of chalk at the speaker. This
year has seen changes in the for-
mat of Union meetings, just as
there have been changes in other
parts of Guilds. We must never
lose the " Sport" side of our
Union ; beer is most essential as
a social equaliser, but we must
not bias another pint; active dis-
cussion over the full gamut of
student interests is essential. But
who is to balance ?

Dear Sir,
Whilst appreciating the need
for more political activity within
I.C. and realizing the wants of the
right-wing fanatics for more pre-
election vote getters. I neverthe-
less feel that a recent pamphlet
circulating in College has gone too
far. I refer, of course, to the
booklet entitled " Keep Right
With God" which has recently
been displayed in South Side.
This form of insidious propa-
ganda must be stamped out im-
mediately] perhaps its proponents
may next appeal to higher au-
thority, even " Keep Right With
Watson " might appear. Let us
unite and stamp out this menace
to our democratic society.

Dear Sir,
In the last Felix you reported
on the Engineer's Dinner Dance
held on January 24th. This is the
formal gathering of our College
Union and is considered by many
to be the best in the I.C. calender.
This year, the function was again
enjoyed by all and one hopes
successful. Your title to the
article, " The Engineer's Booze-
up " is therefore incorrect and in-
sulting.
I would be grateful if in future
you use titles of greater accuracy
and less sensationalism.
Yours faithfully,
ROBERT C. SCHROTER,
City and Guilds College Union.
Ed: Apologies for misrepresen-
tation of what was most certainly
a successful event.

This week's prize statement
comes from Mr. Peter Clayton,
who, judging the I.U.J.F. Com-
petition in Birmingham, said
" Some people like Asparagus,
but I don't." Congratulations to
you-k Mr. C. Your prize, which
will be sent to you from O X F A M ,
is 1 ton of Rice.
Last week an old lady from
Bayswater wrote to me to say that
she enjoyed the last South Side
Stomp, but regretted that she had
to open her windows to hear the
quieter numbers. I'm sure that
won't be necessary this week.
Tonight's Stomp (12th) features
once again that chart-topping
group, the Shadies, whose cur-
rent disc has climbed rapidly to
2,741 in the American Hit Parade,
and is doing well in Singapore.
Also on the Bill, by popular
request, is the I.C. Big Band,
whose leader, Ken Gibson, wants
you to know that he loves aspara-
gus madly. Late night jazz will
be served (on ice) by The Clive
Heath Quartet.
A two shillings bribe will be
enough to get a F R E E ticket for
tonight, if there is room to get in.
Dear Sir,
As fully fledged and almost
flown ICWArians, we read with
interest and became increasingly
fluffed up about the contents of
" liirdsnest" in the last batch of
Felix.
Having had no complaints
about our appearance or lack of
feminity in the last two and a half
years, we feel that our " lecture
kit" has been adequate and in
most cases pleasing. We beg to
suggest that the " with-it chick "
takes more detailed observation of
her fellow birds.
Yours broodingly.
Stonechat, Whinchat,
and Backchat.
Dear Sir,
Although it is indeed a great
honour to be mentioned by Mr.
Colcutt, I would like to make it
clear that my comments on I.C..
Union in 1999 A.D. were intended
to be not bitter but light-hearted.
It seems unfortunate that any
attempt to treat the Union with
the humour it deserves should
immediately be misconstrued.
Yours faithfully,
PAUL ROGERS

Dear Sir,
In defence both of my integrity
and my policies, I would like to
point out that a piece of friendly
advice from our Rector can in no
way be considered as censorship.
I will say no more; the vulgar
publicity to which my allegorical
writings have been subjected
pains me more than words can
convey.
Yours faithfully.

Birth of a Nation
Fifty years ago D. W. Griffith
started shooting his first epic
picture, " Birth of a Nation."
This film, concerned with the
history of the United States of
America, is now treasured as an
example of a forgotten art, that
of the silent film. Not merely did
Griffith establish the claims of the
cinema to be art but he challenged
the supremacy of the theatre and
presented it with a serious rival.
In 1915 "Birth of a Nation"
ran for forty-four consecutive
weeks in New York. Unfortu-
nately we can only show it on one
day, Friday, February 14th. The
film will be presented with an au-
thentic 1915 piano accompani-
ment a( 7 p.m. in Room 342,
Mech. Eng. The pianist will be
Mr. Arthur Dulay from the
National Film Theatre.
