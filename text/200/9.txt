Although the Council Meeting on Monday, 3rd February, lasted
for 6 hours it was a great improvement on the one held the week
before. Everyone had already agreed to the setting up of the posi-
tion of Deputy President but there were many views on the method
of election of this post and also that of the President and Secretary.
After discussion all the possible permutations of elections, i.e., all
three from Council to all three from the Union Floor, at some length,
it was decided that the Deputy President alone should be elected
by the Union Members at the Annual General Meeting
This method has practical difficulties ; for if the Deputy Presi-
dent also wishes to stand for President and is elected there appeared
no easy solution to electing a new Deputy President. After much
heated argument, during which some Council Members changed
their minds over the Union Election of the Deputy President. It was
decided that Council should not appoint the new Deputy President.
Felix
The Felix Board Report caused
some controversy as reported in
the Late News of our last issue.
Many people on Council thought
that Dave Watson had been more
than a little harsh in his condem-
nation of Michael Combes and
after an exchange between the
President and Roger Henson, who
raised the matter, the report was
altered to congratulate Felix on
financial success of this paper.
Other Matters
Among other points raised
were, the opening of the Union
Bar on Sunday evenings. This
should happen again soon, but
alas to the detriment of the mid-
day customers as it may not open
at midday on Sundays due to
staff difficulties (robbing Peter to
pay Paul?). A department of
Social Studies is being set up at
the College, and optional social
studies will shortly be a part of
every degree course. This, I sup-
pose, is to try to change the
general opinion of illiterate beer
drinking engineers.
A collection of paintings is to
be exhibited in advantageous
positions around South Side. An-
other move to improve our
general knowledge perhaps ?
Kennedy Fund
The Council defeated by 15
votes to none a motion that the
Union should organise a collec-
tion for the Kennedy Fund. This
fund is to provide a scholarship
for a British Graduate to study
at Harvard. As a part of Lon-
don's £5,000 towards the £25,000
target I.C. would have to provide
£600, 4/- per student—an impos-
sible feat. Collecting tins will be
provided but there will be no
high pressure salesmanship.
This is the first time that the
Union Member has been able to
elect a member of the Executive
(except the R.C.S., C . & G . , and
Mines Presidents) and it marks a
great step forward in the Union.
A Deputy President, in charge of
the Union Buildings, could do a
great deal to changing most peo-
ple's attitude to the Union.
Queries, complaints, etc., dealt
with promptly will make for bet-
ter running of the Union. Let us
hope that this is the beginning of
a Union revival, for whatever
anybody says the Union is in a
bad state when so few people
take advantage of the many
facilities provided.
Car Parking
Bob Schroter, in his car park-
ing report, made one very en-
lightening statement: the South
Side car park can be used by any-
one at I.C., not just the Halls
Residents. This means that those
in Hall have wasted their shillings
on buying those South Side
Stickers. The Car Parking Com-
mittee is looking very carefully
into the need of providing park-
ing places. To this end a ques-
tionnaire will be sent out to
everyone at the College in the
near future and everyone is
urged to answer it in their own
interest.
Council Quotes
" Keep your big mouths shut!"
Havard of the President.
" Could you please repeat the
motion on the floor."
" There is no motion on the
floor."
" I'm not trying to stir."
"Complete abortion." Pete
Alison on Council.
" A* great improvement." Felix
reporter.
H AND DO YOU CONSIDER
YOUR GRANT TO BE
ENOUGH FOR A FAIR
STANDARD OF LIVING ?
In his report to Council about
Felix, the President delivered a
harsh and unfair statement ne-
glecting the obvious fact that this
year the editor has succeeded in
producing an economic and origi-
nal newspaper. On the other hand
Mr. Combes has sailed very
close to the wind and no one
would say that his editorial policy
has met with universal acclaim.
This academic year has seen
many heated battles between Mr.
Combes and the executive led by
Mr. Watson. The reason for this
could be the origifial policy of the
editor or the executive's lack of
experience in the production of
a newspaper. It is justifiable that
Mr. Combes becomes annoyed by
criticisms levelled by people with
no experience of Felix, on small
matters such as the printers' er-
rors, which are almost impossible
to avoid or the fact that a com-
plete financial statement cannot be
produced until the end of the year,
because bills in respect of ad-
vertisements and other matters
are not paid till late in the year.
Mr. Combes seems to be able to
gauge accurately how far he can
go without having to resign, but
this is not always true of his
staff. The whole structure and
policy of Felix is so delicately
poised at present, that cases of
misrepresentation of fact, which
have come from the pen of one of
the staff, could very easily destroy
the achievements of this year.
Council and the President
A recent report of council
proceedings has suggested that the
whole thing is a waste of time and
that council members would be
much better occupied elsewhere.
No mention was made of the way
in which council members occupy
themselves at meetings, and this
might be of interest. Mr. Price
talks a lot and gets confused; Mr.
Tye talks little but usually sense;
Mr. Edwards is perpetually dis-
satisfied; Mr. Stocks feels; Mr.
Ellis reiterates; Mr. Henson de-
fends Felix successfully; Mr.
Massey's ideas are becoming
more conventional; Miss Tait
draws interesting landscapes; Mr.
Beadle takes notes to some pur-
pose, Mr. Schroter is the voice
of City and Guilds. ; It might
also be in order to report some of
the things which were discussed
at the last meeting. The Felix
board report produced sparks be-
tween Mr. Watson and Mr. Hen-
son, who demanded its with-
drawal. Unfortunately, although
all the members of the Felix board
were present, only Mr. Schroter
and Mr. Tye dared to suggest that
the President might be wrong, and
asked for a comment to the fact
that at least the newspaper was ah
economic success this year.
Mr. Watson told the meeting
that if business continued after
9.0 p.m. free beer would be the
order of the day and Mr. Havard
immediately saw his destiny. He
was elected to the bookstall com-
mittee for his pains. . Mr. Berry
produced a concise report of the
proceedings of U L U Presidents
Council and shed light on the
John F. Kennedy fund which
turns out to be a very dubious
proposal. Council then discus-
sed the mode of election of the
senior executive under the pro-
posed new system, at considerable
length without coming to any de-
cision. The President was heard
to comment " it's a shambles"
when he left the meeting, but it is
really his job to prevent a sham-
bles. Perhaps if he controlled
council meetings as he used io
last term more would be achieved.
Comment
The article written under the
pseudonym Cuttloc is not in any
way connected with this source
and the information contained in
it is not always as accurate as it
might be.
The three motions for the Inter
Collegiate Debating Competition
were the work of Mr. Tony Berry.
One cannot but admire the
subtlety of these motions, but it is
wrong for Mr. Berry to assume
that there are sufficient really
good debaters in the college to
make use of the many opportu-
nities presented by these topics.
To Mr. Collins of Southside
who knows me quite well, I do-
nate the following proverb which
I have made up for his benefit;
" Read before you write," I hope
it will help him to realise who his
friends are in future.
It is encouraging to see that this
years Carnival organiser has the
courage to carry out his idea of
buying a car as first prize for the
carnival raffle. If he is successful
this will be the best idea yet.
