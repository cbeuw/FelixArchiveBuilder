RESEARCH SECTIONS
COMMUNICATIONS
The transmission ot information
has long been a problem of inter-
est to electrical engineers. In the
early days research workers were
concerned almost entirely with the
then formidable task of making
devices that worked. Today this
emphasis on hardware alone is
receding and engineers are taking
a much broader view of commu-
nication problems.
One field of research in his
laboratory that has captured
attention is Psycho-acoustics,
which is concerned with the
measurement of aural perception.
The sudden interest in this sub-
ject stems from the work of
Claude E. Shannon ("The Mathe-
matical Theory of Communica-
tions," 1948), which brought
about the realization that present
methods of communication are
monstrously inefficient. For
instance, according to Shannon's
theory, one telephone line can do
the work of a hundred, provided
the speech signals are suitably
coded. Practically, a tenfold
improvement is envisaged. The
most promising approach to date
concerns itself with finding /out
which parameters of sound are
important to the human listener,
the implication being that once we
know this we'heed only transmit
information which is relevant for
perception and omit the rest.
An investigation of the phe-
nomenon of binaural fusion has
yielded results which jxrint the
way to improvements in practical
telephone systems. It has been
established that a very small time
difference and/or amplitude dif-
ference between the signals ar-
riving at each ear are the primary
physical variables enabling us to
perceive the direction of a sound
source. Further experiments
have shown, for example, that if
two sounds are spatially far apart
then it is easier to concentrate on
.one or other of the sounds. On
the basis of this a scheme has
been developed using binaural
techniques whereby the wanted
speech sound and the unwanted
noise in a telephone channel are
each given different apparent posi-
tions. This makes it easier for
the listener to concentrate on the
wanted message, resulting in im-
proved intelligibility.
Other work in the Laboratory
is concerned with the perception
of short bursts of sound, the per-
ception of moving sounds, :md
with the factors influencing the
formation of a single sound with
stimuli from two separate sources.
Work is also being carried out
in the percsption of sharp con-
tours on a noisy television screen,
as well as a scheme for scaling the
quality of television pictures pro-
duced by a bandwidth compres-
sion sch2me: although the lattter
is unlikely to be significant for
broadcasting purposes, several
interested industrial organizations
are studying its possible applica-
tions in other directions.
In the course of tackling the
above problems new techniques
have been evolved and many of
these have been vf interest to
workers in other fields. Similarly
many of the methods applied in
the Communications Laboratory
originate from apparently unrela-
ted disciplines such, for example,
as Quality Control or Mental Test
Theory. There are many who
speculate on the superficial nature
of inter-disciplinary barriers. This
Laboratory provides an example
of just how superficial some of
these barriers are.
effect has been termed the piezo-
magnetic effect, through which a
specimen becomes magnetized
when stressed mechanically. This
has recently been discussed as a
possible basis for the prediction of
earthquakes. The Materials Sec-
tion is investigating the effects
with the hope of finding new ma-
terials with improved properties.
Research is also being carried
out on the shape dependence of
magnetostriction in standard
magnetic materials.
Semiconductors
Work on semiconductors in-
cludes a number of basic physical
investigations, noticeably measure-
ment of carrier lifetime which has
direct relevance to transistor
performance. In addition, new
intermetallic semiconductor ma-
terials are being synthesised for
application to thermomagnetic
refrigeration using the Ettings-
systems and machines
The economic progress and de-
velopment of any country depends
upon the availability of a cheap
and abundant source of power.
In most countries, electrical en-
ergy provides this source and re-
quires that the generation, trans-
mission and distribution of
electricity continually expands to
meet the ever-growing demands of
the consumer. Most countries now
double their total demand for
electricity every seven to ten
years. Consequently, electrical
engineering must progress at an
equal rate to enable new and more
efficient power stations to be com-
missioned and a transmission or
grid network to be built which
will ensure adequate supplies at

This academic year has seen
the beginning of an interdepart-
mental " Science of Materials"
course at I.C. in which Electrical
Engineering Department * is a
participant. It's aim is to pro-
vide an introduction to theoretical
and engineering aspects of ma-
terials. Projects undertaken in
third terms lead to a D.I.C.
Research
The research interests of the
Materials Section are centred on
investigation and development of
materials with potential techno-
logical importance. There are
three main groups:
(1) Magnetic materials.
(2) Semiconductors
(3) Thin films and surface
studies.
Magnetic Materials
Three years ago the first reports
were made of the observation of
the magneto-electric effect. Ma-
terials showing the effect are
capable of magnetization by the
application of an electric field.
Whilst the effect is small it is of
potential importance in, for
example, the thermionic generator
since a standing electric field
could be produced simply by
putting a permanent magnet
around the device. A related
hausen effect. This project is a
joint one with the British Oxygen
Company aimed at producing a
low-temperature refrigerator.
Thin Films
The thin films and surface
studies group is concerned with
the properties of metals and
semiconductors in thin-film form.
A study of the magnetic proper-
ties of thin nickel films is being
undertaken with the co-operation
of International Computers and
Tabulators Ltd. Mr. D. S. Camp-
bell, of the Plessey Company,
who is a visiting Lecturer in the
Section, is supervising other thin-
film resistors and capacitors.
Studies of germanium in thin-
film form are aimed at determin-
ing the influence of mechanical
structure on electrical properties.
This has importance in the present
considerable effort being put into
the development of a thin-film
active device.
A mass spectrometer analyser
is being used to investigate the ex-
change kinetics between a gas
adsorbed on the surface of a tran-
sition metal film and its free
isotope.
Further work has been initiated
on the electrical properties of
uranium dioxide and on slow-
electron diffraction.

reasonable cost without too much
despoliation of the countryside.
Many problems are continually
arising in this ever-expanding sup-
ply industry, and to study some
of the basic problems involved,
models of power system networks
have been built in the Power
Systems and Machines Labora-
tories of the Department. Small
electrical machines are used to
simulate large turbo or hydro
generators, transmission and dis-
tribution networks are construc-
ted from resistors, inductors and
capacitors, and the consumer is
represented by loads which can be
made to behave in characteristic
fashion. A model of particular
interest is that of a direct current
system which can be used with the
more usual a.c. system model to
study the possibilities and prob-
lems involved when this form of
transmission is employed for cable
routes, such as, the Cross Channel
connection between England and
France. High voltage d.c. trans-
mission when fully developed will
enable economic undergrounding
of overhead lines, producing a
solution to the amenity problem
which is obviously desired in this
country.
