Second Year Electrical En-
gineering Students have been
heard talking to their friends
about Cargo Cults, Kinship
Groups, Cabinet Dictatorship,
Utopography, Nazi Propaganda
and other non-electrical subjects.
What's going on?
Four courses are being offered
to the class this year-Humanities,
Social Anthropology, Politics and
Psychology. Together these
courses aim to probe questions
which are of interest to intelligent
citizens in general and to tech-
nologists in particular. The
courses are neither a cultural
sheep-dip nor a dose of cabbage
water. Their main function is
porridge-stirring. Seeking to raise
fundamental questions about
human society and the individual,
they are designed to draw atten-
tion to some of the social and
political consequences of techno-
logy, and to take a penetrating
look at some basic artistic and
humanist values. They are also
intended to provide introductions
to the various fields of thought
which they represent.
Humanities
Mr. Goodlad's course in the
" Humanities has the twin aims
of providing a literary com-
mentary on certain important 20th
Century events, and of introduc-
ing techniques of criticism. Chalk
and talk recounting of history has
been avoided, and the course has
concentrated on giving " worm's
eye views' of the subjects covered;
it has sought to examine what has
b:jn going on lhrou~h the eyes of
\ liters of literature, while films
and select reading lists have
offered the broader picture to
those interested.. The First World
War, for example, was seen
through the eyes of some of the
War Poets — Owen, Sassoon,
Brooke—and through the mem-
oirs of such writers as Robert
Graves, Edmund Blunden and
Vera Brittain. The Great Depres-
sion was examined through the
eyes of Orwell, Priestley, Green-
wood, Spender and Steinbeck, as
well as through some of the social
surveys of the period which
sought to bring the plight of the
unemployed to public notice. A
similar technique is being fol-
lowed with the Spanish Civil War
and the Second World War.
The " worm's eye " technique
aims not only to show what the
cataclysmic events of this century
meant to the articulate layman,
but also to distinguish the marks
of excellence in the various liter-
ary genre—poetry, novels, essays,
plays.' A lecture on propaganda
as used in the two World Wars
was followed by discussion of the
propagandist aims of certain
novelists, in particular the writers
of Utopias and anti-Utopias
Ideas and techniques of present-
ing ideas received equal attention.
Again, the current discusion of
drama aims not only to show the
dramatists' ideas, but to analyse
the effectiveness of various types
of drama as vehicles for ideas.
Politics
The Introduction to Politics,
presented by Mr. K . Minogue and
Mr. Robert McKenzie of LSE,
has added a further dimension to
the coverage of 20th Century
events. Mr. McKenzie took the
lid off the British political scene,
exposing the fallacies of some cur-
rent beliefs about the operation of
the parties. Mr. Minogue probed
the very basis of the democratic
system, analysing the nature of
government and the attempts of
the liberal states to limit indi-
vidual power by placing legislative
executive and judicial power in
different hands. By way of con-
trast, Mr. Minogue gave a thor-
ough analysis of modern totali-
tarianism, drawing material from
Stalinist Russia and Nazi Ger-
many. Examining the affinity to
religion of the official ideologies,
he drew parallels with certain
millenial movements that have
arisen from time to time in the
world, often as a result of rapid
social change. This social change
may in turn be the result of rapid
technological change. This was
a subject dwelt on by Dr. Benedict
in his course introducing
Social Anthropology
Dr. Benedict also drew atten-
tion to the impact of technology
on primitive societies, and ex-
plained the function of millenial
movements and cults-U.S. Ghost
dancers. Cargo Cults in the Pacific
etc.—in restructuring the social
relationships damaged by rapid
technological change. In his
scholarly examination of group
behaviour and its possible causes,
Dr. Benedict had occasion to
dwell on many subjects of intense
interest to the socially conscious
engineer—-the concept of Race,
and the causes of Race prejudice;
the effect of environment on be-
haviour, such as territoriality,
social rank and hierarchy; the
importance of kinship in social
groupings, and the varieties of
good antidote to the English-
ethical and social behaviour, (a
man's belief that the customs of
his nation are the laws of nature);
the definition and importance of
social status.
Psychology
This fourth course, given by
Mr. Price-Williams of LSE,
promises to push the study pf
human' behaviour as far as aca-
demic method can. The first three
courses have shown groups ol
humans trying to organise them-
selves, blasting each other to
pieces, planning Utopias, wor-
shipping strange gods in the stress
brought about by technological
change—they have shown the
prophets and politicians trying to
manipulate the lives of their peers
through persuasion in novels,
plays, tracts, broadcasts, films,
through sham democracy and with
machine-guns and bombs. Mr.
Price-Wiiliams, drawing the veil
from a strange world of rats run-
ning through cages, babies smiling
at broom-heads, birds building
onto imaginary nests, is providing
a provocative insight into how the
psychologist tries to find out what
makes people tick.
Sound and Fury ?
These courses take up time; are
they worthwhile? Do they provide
anything that is not already pro-
vided in the college General
Studies programme? The answers
to these questions should really
come from someone who is taking
the courses. But it is hoped that
the courses will have had value in
some of the following ways:
* By providing an ordered ac-
count of important events which
everyone is assumed to know
about, but which few people are
taught about.
* By providing courses of lec-
tures backed by reading sug-
gestions, discussion meetings,
and tutorials, which can probe
more deeply into a subject than
an unsupported course.
* By providing opportunities for
those taking the courses to
practice expressing themselves
in writing and speech. In addi-
tion to group discussions, the
course has included public
speaking classes, and a third of
the 2EE group have embarked
upon projects (in anticipation
of a third-year essay require-
ment) on a variety of subjects
ranging from " The effects of
T V on children's reading
habits" and " The use of
short wave radio in the First
World War " to a study of the
legend of the Cretan Minotaur.
But perhaps the most important
thing of all, at this stage, is the
fact that the Electrical Engineer-
ing Department is refusing to ac-
cept a variety of current assump-
tions—the assumption that if a
student shows proficiency in
mathematics at the age of 15 and
goes onto the Science Side at
school, he thereby ends his formal
contact with anything other than
science and technology; the as-
sumption that one can pick up in
casual conversation a knowledge
of the varied aims and motives of
human beings; the assumption
that study of the root causes of
some of our current problems
should be left to social science
specialists, and that technologists
should not be distracted by con-
siderations of the possible effects
of their technology on communi-
ties advanced and primitive; the
assumption that engineers should
not take part in government.
WAR BY WISDOM
Since this time last week, the
world's population will have in-
creased by over a million. Three-
quarters of these people will be
undernourished and underprivi-
leged. The task of feeding, hous-
ing, educating, and employing
these people is awesome. Tech-
nology will have a large part to
play, and the solution of the
problems will be easier if tech-
nologists are alive to the social
and political difficulties involved.
At the moment we see through a
glass darkly, and the courses
offered in the Electrical Depart-
ment will be modified constantly
in the light of experience. Some
may doubt the relevance of the
courses at present being offered in
such a complex situation; but a
frontal attack is sometimes less
effective than a flanking attack.
The novelist who shows the des-
perate condition of an unem-
ployed factory worker, the
anthropologist who shows the
chaos wrought in a village com-
munity by unsubtle introduction
of technical devices, the political
scientist who shows how quickly
confused citizens turn to strange
gods and stranger political sys-
tems, the psychologist who shows
the a-rational desires of individu-
als . . . all these may encourage
fruitful thought about the social
situation. We hope too that they
may be intellectually stimulating
in other ways. This is what we
mean by stirring the porridge
. . . we cannot, and would not
if we could, spoon feed.
