This is, perhaps, a permissible
occasio" on which to blow a
trumpet for electrical engineering.
The various branches of it are
now afford ng employment to
about one nillion people; the
annual valu. of its manufactured
products L approaching £1,000
million and, of these products,
over £3 ^0 million worth are being
exported.
The past 25 years or so have
seen the emergence of a world
wide system of telecommunica-
tions; of television and radar; of
the electronic digital computer
and of automation; of a wide
range of solid state devices, of
which the transistor is outstand-
ing; of commercial forms of such
scientific instruments as the elec-
tron microscope, the mass spec-
trometer and the particle accel-
erator; and of fusion-type nuclear
power stations.
Alongside these brand new
developments there have also
been considerable improvements
in previously well-established
fields. For example, since 1948
the size of steam-turbine driven
electrical generator units has risen
from 30 to 500 megawatts; the
overall thermal efficiency has in-
creased from 27.6 to 39.2 per cent;
and the capital cost of the total
installation per kilowatt sent out
has decreased from £67 to £35.
We must now say that these
and other achievements which
mikht be mentioned are only to be
credited in part to electrical
engineers. They are, in fact, the
result in varying degrees of co-
operation between electrical en-
gineers and physicists, chemists,
mathematicians, metallurgists and
civil, mechanical, chemical and
aeronautical engineers. Indeed,
the pursuit of electrical engineer-
ing is by no means an activity
merely of men who call them-
selves electrical engineers, but of
teams of representatives of a di-
versity of scientific and technolo-
gical disciplines, to which must
also be added the contributions
of members of other professional
persuasions such as economics,
law, sociology, etc.
It is the job of the Electrical
Engineering Department to pre-
pare its undergraduate and post-
graduate students for participa-
tion in this broadly-based partner-
ship. We should be claiming too
much were we to pretend that we
yet know how best to do this,
since we are involved in a rapidly
changing scientific, technological
and sociological situation. What
we can claim, however, is that we
are conscious of the need for con-
tinuous re-appraisal of our under-
graduate and postgraduate cur-
ricula and that we are now deeply
engaged in this; and that we are
crving a variety of experiments in
an attempt to improve the tech-
niques of lecturing and tutorial
work. For example, the whole of
cur new building has now been
wired for closed-circuit television
to enable demonstrations to be
televised from laboratories to lec-
ture-rooms, and other unconven-
tional teaching techniques are also
being investigated.
In addition, we are experiment-
ing with the incorporation of
courses aimed at opening the
minds of our undergraduates to
the humanistic aspects of engin-
eering work, and to the social
consequences and implications of
its progress. The fact that not all
our students seem yet to be wholly
" with us " in some of these ex-
periments is unlikely to deter us
from our continued attempt to
prepare them more effectively for
their later careers and for life.
We have now been in our new
high block building for about
eighteen months and, on the
whole, are very pleased with it. Its
total population of teaching,
technical and secretarial staff, and
of undergraduate and postgradu-
ate students, is well over 400, and
the fyrther growth arising from
the implementation of the Rob-
bins Report—combined with our
undertaking to house the College
Computing Centre—prpmise to
produce a tight situation much
earlier than was envisaged when
the building was planned only
seven or eight years ago.
As with other Departments, our
main difficulty is likely to be that
of acquiring a sufficient number
of new staff members of high
quality, partly to deal with the
expanding student numbers and
partly to replace those who gain
promotion elsewhere or who 30
overseas on secondment to teach
in the engineering schools of the
developing countries. In the latter
connection, one of our staff—Mr.
J. C. Carpenter—has been serving
as Professor of Electrical Engin-
eering in the University of the
West Indies for the past two
years. He will be rejoining us in
October next, but by then Mr.
R. A . King may have commenced
a three-year secondment as Pro-
fessor of Control Engineering to
the Indian Institute of Technology
in Delhi — with which Imperial
College has established a "Sister-
hood" relationship—as also will
one of the most experienced of
our technical staff, Mr. A . A .
White, who will serve as electrical
supervisor to the Institute at
Delhi The Department attaches
great importance to this kind of
overseas service, and is deter-
mined to extend it wherever cir-
cumstances permit.
The designation of Imperial
College as a S.I.S.T.E.R. (Special
Institution for Scientific and
Technological Education and Re-
search) by the Robbins Commit-
tee adds emphasis to the national
importance of the College's con-
tribution at the postgraduate level.
With a view to strengthening our
own contribution in this respect
we are seeking to attach to the
staff of the Department as Special
Lecturers an increasing number of
outstanding practicing electrical
engineers. This session we nre
in the fortunate position that two
industrial concerns have seconded
senior staff members to us on a
half-time basis, and in addition a
member of the Electricity Coun-
cil, the head of the Post Office
Research Station, and a senior
engineer of the British Transport
commission are giving invaluable
help as part-time lecturers and
organisers of postgraduate sym-
posia in their special fields.
Some exciting new prospects of
electrical engineering development
are in the pipeline. A variety of
new solid state devices, illustrated
by tne maser and the laser, may
soon become of considerable
technological importance; it may
not be long before low-tempera-
ture physics enters the domain of
power engineering as well as that
of the computer; while rapidly in-
creasing effort is being devoted to
several new possibilities of large-
scale electrical power generation
employing thermionic, thermo-
electric, magnetohydrodynamic
and thermo-nuclear processes.
The translation of these pros-
pects into efficient, reliable and
economic devices and equipment
will involve the resolution of
engineering problems at least as
difficult and as intellectually
searching as the scientific ones
v being investigated. It is up
to us to ensure that the student
products of the City and Guilds
are fully capable of resolving i
them.

MEDICINE
Engineering in Medicine is a
new group in the Electrical De-
partment, which was set up to
fulfil the joint functions of post-
graduate training and research.
Postgraduate Training
The training is intended mainly
for experienced graduates in me-
dicine and biology normally en-
gaged in research and clinical
analysis who receive here a year's
intensive instruction in the princi-
ples and use of electronic nnd
mechanical apparatus, and a
thorough understanding of mod-
ern physical and mathematical
techniques relevant to their work.
A considerable amount of inter-
departmental co-operation is in-
volved in providing this training
and specialized lecturers irom
medical research institutes also
contribute.
The nine students taking the
course this year come from
Britain, Canada, Italy and Portu-
gal. A l l but two hold higher
degrees and have already done
much research. Five are medi-
cally qualified and two are physio-
logists, one is qualified in mecha-
nical engineering and physics, and
the last has a mechanical engin-
eering degree and has been
working on artificial limbs. Others
among the students have previ-
ously been doing research on such
subjects as the application of
fluid flow to circulation in the
kidneys; the bio-chemistry of
anaesthetics; the chemistry of
drugs, particularly in their effects
on processes in the brain; and
aviation medicine.
Although the students attend
over 200 lectures, the main part of
the course is laboratory work
which is closely supervized by the
staff in the group. In the second
half of the year each student
undertakes an original experi-
mental project, which is chosen
to suit his special interests, and on
which he will finally write a full
report.
Research
The research section of the
group deals mainly with investi-
gating brain and nerve processes,
and with instrumentation. An
interesting problem being tackled
is to find out how the human
brain constructs an integrated
picture of the external world by
combining the separate evidence
from the senses of sight, hearing
and touch. One of the research
students is investigating a simpli-
fied form of this problem involv-
ing only sight and hearing. A
subject learns to track an acoustic
image, and studies are made of
the influence on his judgements
about image position of aiding or
conflicting information from a
secondary, visual, ^image. The
results of these experiments may
give insight into how we build up
a picture of the world around us.
