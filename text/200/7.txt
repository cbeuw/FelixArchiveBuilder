POWER &
One problem which is receiving
much attention is that of the con-
trol of the power system network.
When a fault or short-circuit oc-
curs on the system causing a line
or generator to trip out of circuit,
the resultant redistribution of
power may cause other lines and
generators to overload, thus pre-
cipitating cascade effects which
can cause blackouts over large
areas. In these circumstances,
the traditional means of com-
munication and control, exercised
by control engineers by telephone,
cannot always operate with suf-
ficient speed to avert serious dis-
turbance and, in the extreme case,
disaster.
In the future, it will be neces-
MACHINES Cont
sary for large power systems, as,
for example, the British Grid
System, to be operated by cen-
tralised computer control. System
data will be telemetered to the
control computer which will per-
form optimising calculations and
issue instructions to satellite com-
puters, which will, in turn, per-
form the necessary control func-
tions on the generators, turbines
and transmission system. In the
laboratory a variety of control
techniques are being studied and
assessed and new techniques are
being developed in order to arrive
at a generalised philosophy of
automatic control for such sys-
tems.
AUTOMATIC CONTROL SYSTEM
The Automatic Control Section
is responsible for teaching auto-
matic control techniques and the
philosophy that underlies their
application throughout the Col-
lege, both at undergraduate and
postgraduate levels. It runs a
one-year postgraduate course
which is the most advanced of its
kind in this country. The group
also engages in researches on
automatic control, seeking to put
the subject on a proper scientific
basis and to extend our knowledge
on how to apply these techniques
to the control of industrial proces-
ses. In doing this, extensive use
is made of digital computers and
work has just started on four-
year programme of research in
which use will be made of a large-
scale digital computer (Atlas) for
direct control of some difficult
industrial processes.
In undertaking this very general
research investigation it is our
intention to continuously seek
favourable industrial contexts for
the work and it is pleasing to be
able to report our continued col-
laboration and support from five
industries with who. we are
associated on specific proj^ s, as
follows: —
Central Electricity Generating
Board (Electricity Supply)
We are .investigating the possi-
bilities of applying optimal
methods to on-line use of digital
computers for adaptive control of
a sizeable power system. The
problem of economic scheduling
of power generation to meet a
given load demand while satis-
fying a power limit and limited
rate of rise of power has been
investigated. The problem of
optimal frequency control is also
being investigated.
Royal Aircraft Establishment
(Aerospace)
We are investigating the opti-
mal control of a homing missile
ending on a terminal-time criteri-
on where the terminal time is not
accurately known; and also when
the information received by the
missile of the target position is
incomplete, noisy and non-linear.
United Kingdom Atomic Energy
'Authority-and-National Institute
for Research into Nuclear
Science (Nuclear Power)
With the U K A E A we are hav-
ing discussions on the possibility
of direct computer control of a
nuclear reactor and with NIRNS
we are engaged on studies of the
optimal control of a linear accele-
rator associated with NIMROD,
the high-energy proton accelera-
tor.
British Iron and Steel Research
Association (Steel Industry)
We are, in collaboration,
making a general study of non-
corifact speed measurement utiliz-
ing correlation methods. The first
method being investigated is a
photo-electric one and arising
from this we are making a funda-
mental study of the reflection of
light from moving surfaces and
the implications that this will have
on the form of the optical system
required for successful correlation
analysis.
National Physical Laboratory
(Chemical Process Control)
We are collaborating on the
optimal control of a pilot-scale
process. This is a small-scale
distillation column which has been
set up by the N P L for the pur-
poses of evaluating certain opti-
misation techniques. The effort
will be, devoted initially to the
plant-modelling problem and later
to the application of optimal-con-
trol techniques.
Other problems being< studied
which have an industrial interest
include a study of the boiler start-
up problem; the influence of
queue discipline on traffic control;
the development of a high-speed
data link to Atlas using a tele-
vision co-axial cable; and auto-
matic hill-climbing devices for
maintaining maximum efficiency
in plant under varying disturbance
and load conditions.
PROFESSOR JUSTIN
A PROFILE
Professor Tustin began his
industrial career some fifty years
ago, at the age of sixteen, as an
apprentice with Charles Parsons
Limited. At that time the firm
was engaged in the development
of the steam turbine, and Profes-
sor Tustin spent much of his time
removing the irregularities from
steel castings with a cold chisel
and hammer, because modern
abrasives were not known in
those days. The workshop was
dark, dirty and unpleasant,
littered with thrown away food
and rubbish, and ridden with rats
and fleas. When the men started
work at six o'clock in the morn-
ing, sunlight only penetrated the
grimy windows where the panes
were broken.
Professor Tustin has spent two
extended periods abroad in dra-
matically different countries —
Russia and the U.S.A. He went to
Russia in 1932 (when the British
Traction Industry was at a stand-
still) to work at the Moscow Trac-
tion Works, where he joined a
group of engineers, several of
them from other countries. At
that time ihey were building the
Moscow Underground Railway
and were electrifying the main line
from Moscow. Professor Tustiu
was much impressed by the en-
thusiasm and determination which
alone achieved success at a time
when th :re was a shortage of
of everyday commodities, even of
paper to write on. He believes
this determi lation and persever-
ance to be responsible foT the
rapid grow, i of Russia's tech-
nology to III; outstanding level of
achievement he saw when he
returneJ fiere for a short time in
196C.
During the war Professor Tus-
tin was involved in the develop-
ment of automatic control, par-
ticularly automatic gun-laying
and gyroscopic stabilisation. Soon
after the war he was appointed
Head of the Department of Elec-
trical Engineering at the Univer-
sity of Birmingham.
Protessor Tustin has also been
to the U.S.A. as a visiting profes-
sor at the M.I.T. in 1955, which
gave him the valuable opportunity
of assessing American technical
education. Of American research,
he says that sometimes so much
time is spent installing and ma-
nipulating elaborate apparatus
that not enough thought is given
to the work being carried out.
However, the resources of men
and money are so great that this
fault has not been very important.
Shortly after he returned to
England, Professor Tustin be-
came Head of the Electrical
Engineering Department at Im-
perial College—a position which
he held until the return of Sir
Willis Jackson. Professor Tustin
welcomed his release from the
administration which had cur-
tailed his other activities. Since
then, although much of his time
has still been taken up with
problems concerned with the ex-
pansion of the Department and
admission of students, he has
been able to devote more time to
work in the heavy electrical
engineering field such as energy
losses in electrical machines, and
economic aspects of engineering.
When he retires from the Col-
lege in October next Professor
Tustin will be able to look back
on a long and useful career in
industry and teaching. But retire-
ment will not mean the end of
his contribution to science, as it
will enable him to devote more
time to his other interests, one of
which is electrical phenomena in
the brain.. His own fertile brain
will ensure that he does not lack
absorbing problems in his retire-
ment.
P.G. ACTIVITY
Various sections of the Depart-
ment have been organising lec-
tures and seminars during the
year. Professor Cherry presented
a series of meetings on " Social
Aspects of Communication " and
Mr. Cory has presented a weekly
seminar on " Broader Aspects of
Electricity Supply." In addition
meetings are held four or five
times a term in which Staff and
P.G.s can meet informally over
drinks and discuss some topic of
current or general interest. This
term, for example. Sir Willis
Jackson has talked about en-
gineering and politics in Africa;
Professor Tustin has given his
personal impressions of the Slump
and discussed how such disasters
can be avoided in the future; a
Ghanian P.G. will later be talking
about some problems in his
country. Gradually a picture is
being built up of the engineer in a
world of people. Experiment con-
stantly takes place to ensure that
both engineering and people
receive due attention in the edu-
cation the Department is seeking
to provide, for engineering exists
to serve people and a university
department should lead the way
in trying to understand both.
