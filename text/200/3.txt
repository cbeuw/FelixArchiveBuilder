This article is written for Felix since comments published in
the \9%th and 199//i issues clearly require that certain members of
'the Board of Directors should give some account of their actions.
Mr. Combes lives within a few yards of me in Beit Hall. His
editorial in the \99th Felix must have been in existence in manu-
script or proof form for at least a week. I had no knowledge of
it until to-day, Wednesday, which was effectively too late to meet
the copy deadline for the 200th edition. I have therefore made
arrangements directly with the printers to have this statement
type-set.
There has not been sufficient time to consult other members of
the Felix board and this must therefore be taken as a personal view.
Neither have I had time to check certain factual information.

Felix is "The Newspaper of
Imperial College Union " (though
this is no longer stated on the
title page.) It has been developed
as such by generations of I.C.
students. Last year it broke even
financially so there is no insuper-
able barrier to any group of
people publishing an alternative.
The Felix Board takes the view
that the reporting of Union ac-
tivities is essential to the Union,
especially in view of the College's
increasing size and diversification.
If Felix did not exist, it would be
necessary to create it.
A series of occasions have
arisen in which relevant material
was not published. This happened
last term (e.g. the Boat Races on
Morphy Day and the Swimming
Gala) and there were several in-
cidences in which such material
was rejected in Felix number
198: —
1. Carnival News: The Carnival
cannot succeed without pub-
licity. (Subsequently published)
2. The Account of the " Euro-
pean Week " in Paris. (Subse-
quently published along with
a letter of protest.)
3. A report of a Council meeting.
The Union cannot exist as a
democratic institution unless it
is subjected to independent
criticism. If Council is a
waste of time, it must be seen
to be so.
At the Board meeting, the Edi-
tor was asked after a vote of five
in favour and two against (Mr.
Combes and myself abstaining) to
attempt to " improve " the situa-
tion in future. Judging by the
following edition the Editor has
complied with this request and
one would have thought the mat-
ter ended there.
" T H E H O L Y BLISSFUL
M A R T Y R "
However, Mr. Combes has seen
fit to publish an editorial which
contains the clear implication that
an attempt has been made by the
Felix board to limit his freedom
of comment. I wish to deny this
categorically. In my view any
such attempt would have been
quite improper. The attitude
which the Board adopted was en-
tirely in accord with Mr. Massey's
comment " print what you like,
but you must report . . . (these
things)."
Mr. Combes sees himself cast
in the role of martyr to the prin-
ciple of freedom of the Press, with
myself and Les Massey as the
principal persecutors. This alle-
gation is of such a nature that we
feel there is only one course of
action remaining. We intend to
table at motion at the Union
meeting on Feb. 18th so that both
sides can be heard in full and in
the open, and the Union can de-
cide the issue. Mr. Combes, no
less than the President and Secre-
tary, is entitled to a full hearing
from the student body to whom
we are all responsible.
Recently, knowing that I was
going to write this letter, I asked
a group of faithful Church folks,
" What do you think of when I
say L E N T ? "
Three things came to their
minds: (i) Forty days, (ii) denying
yourself something, (iii) a prepar-
tion for Easter. It was a long
time before the period of forty
days was accepted as the length of
Lent, and at first there was no
connection whatever with our
Lord's period in the wilderness.
Secondly it was originally not a
preparation for Easter, but for
what happened at Easter—Bap-
tism, Confirmation and First
Communion. The preparation was
for a fuller life with God. The
emphasis at first was not on doing
without, but on training for the
new life of worship, work and
witness on which they would em-
bark as they came out of the
waters of Baptism. They were
sealed with the gift of the Holy
Spirit by the laying on of hands,
received the Bread of Life, and
wertt out to live this new life
within them in God's world. It
was all positive, constructive; not
negative.
IS SELFSACRIFICEA MISCONCEPTION
The True Meaning of Lent
At this time one is constantly
hearing the question " what are
you giving up for Lent?" It is
rather unfortunate that Lent has
come to be associated with this
form of self sacrifice. This is
most certainly how the Reform-
ers, who set out the prayer book,
did not mean it to be used.
In the Bible there is no
reference whatever to such a
period, and it is believed that it
came into being some centuries
after the Church had been
founded. At the time of the
Reformation, those concerned re-
tained.it, as it was a period which
could usefully be employed as a
time during which Christians
could look forward to Easter.
Hence by prayer and, fasting
with study of the scriptures they
could focus their attention on this,
t'l3 greatest event in this World's
history—the death ; ..id resurrec-
tion of Jesus Christ.
This fasting and prayer is a
custom dating back to the early
Church, and meant complete
abstinence from food and drink
in order to spend the whole time
in prayer with God. It generally
lasted only for one day and at the
very most for three; nowhere in
scripture are we told to fast for
forty days or to make efforts of
self sacrifice. The only sacrifice
asked" of us being that of our
whole lives in His service.
Should any further proof be
required, then Paul in his letter
to Collossians chapter 2, verse
16 to chapter 3, verse 4 answers
a problem which is remarkably
similar to this one of Lent.
M . BAILEY,
(Sec. I.C.C.U.)
Lent to be worthwhile must be
positive: the emphasis on what
you do, rather than on what you
don't do. It is a special effort with
a purpose—that we can enter
more fully into the Resurrection
life of Jesus. That Resurrection
life is for the whole of man—
body, mind and spirit—so any
effort in Lent must involve all
three. So (i) we should make a
deeper offering of our physical life
to God. Most of us are far too
indulgent in this part of our life,
and let our body rule us. To
discipline our body make some
act of self-denial, so that we
train the body to be the obedient
servant of our will and not the
master of our actions. Some in-
dulgence surrendered: — fewer
cigarettes smoked, and the money
given for the hungry; fewer pints
of beer, so that we can get that
land-rover rolling in Chidya.
These are proven helps in self-
mastery as far as our physical
life is concerned. But the more
constructive thing is ALSO to go
beyond this and seek day by day
to glorify God in our bodies. In
an age of sexual indulgence, in
the cult of cosiness, we Christians
are to rejoice in our physical life
and to see the living of it as a way
of adoring God. (ii) We need to
glorify God with our minds, en-
tering more and more into the
knowledge of what God is like
and what His purpose is for our-
selves and the world. This means
reading one book on the Christian
Faith during Lent and knaking
time to take your part in some
course of instruction, school of
prayer, or discussion group: (iii)
It means the whole of self goes
out to ever-deeper union with
God. A "Retreat should be a nor-
mal thing for Christians during
Lent, and in your prayer time
daily more adoration of God and
more waiting on God.
So a happy Lent to you.
