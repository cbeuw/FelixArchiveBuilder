If you should be in the Union
next Saturday week do not be
surprised to find yourself sur-
rounded by well over 500 lean
and hungry athletes. They will
have come to take part in the
Hyde Park Road Relay—I.C.'s
event of the eyar.
This year there will be nearly
90 teams from Universities, Tech-
nical ,and Training Colleges 'as
far away as Glasgow, Edinburgh
and Belfast. It is a major event in
the British athletics calendar with
coverage in the national and
athletics press (and F E L I X too!).
Original Idea
That is the size of it now; this
year, in fact, it will be just ten
times the initial (1949) size. The
original idea came to three I.C.
runners of that year—Tony Watts
(7 times I.C. 440 yds champion
and elected this year's Athletic
Club's president), Bob Gigg (who
ran the fastest lap in that inaugu-
ral race), \\nd Alan Brown—in
the gym showers after a training
run round the park, and indeed
their enthusiasm must have
seemed justified in that year for
I.C. won the race from a field of
eight others. Not that such suc-
cess was to last, for as the race
grew in size and reputation the
standard of competition rose with
it, so that in the following year
we could do no better than 5th
out of 12—Battersea being the
winners.
Famous Names
By 1954 the race was attracting
a record 27 teams including two
or three Oxbridge colleges (thus
making the event socially accept-
able?). Also running in that year,
for the first time, was Martin
Hyman (Southampto/i) (at the
very Start of a running career
which lead to international and
Olympic appearances and the
U.K. 6 mile record.
A feature of those early years,
was the appearance of non-
scoring, impromptu teams, often
containing famous runners who
were ineligible to represent any
college team. In 1954 one such
team with two national (cham-
pions—John Disley (U.K.) and D.
Macmillan (AUS.)—broke the
course record.
Bigger Each Year
In 1958 the entry had risen to
42 teams and I.C. did very well
to come second to Liverpool,
beating into third place a formid-
able Southampton team contain-
ing Martin Hyman and Bruce
Tulloh (later to gain fame as a
sub-four minute miler and Euro-
pean 5,000 metres champion).
Also running for the first ume
that year was Ron Hill the pro-
digious little runner from Bolton
who is currently going from
strength to strength and holds the
U.K. 6m. record (taken from
Hyman) and must be one of our
THE HYDE PARK
best hopes for Tokyo. This years
race will not seem the same with-
out Ron, who has now left Man-
chester University.
The entry shot up during the
next two years until by 1960
there were 70 teams entered, in-
cluding an all-blue team from St.
Catherines Oxford and people
such as Tulloh, Turner (winner
of the recent inter-counties cross
country race), Tim Briault and
Trevor Shoefield: the race that
year was won by Durham with
I.C. 4th.
I.C. Successes
1961 saw one of the most ex-
citing races ever and a very un-
lucky one for I.C. John Collins
had brought us into a 5 sec. lead
on the 4th lap and John Cleator
running the third fastest time of
the day increased this to 30 sees;
a lead which good though it was,
could not prevent Hill and
Turner, running the two fastest
laps of the day, from overtaking
our last man George Wenk and
pushing us into 3rd place.
The following year however our
luck turned and, for the first time
since 1949 we were victorious.
Amongst a record field of 80,
I.C.'s team of Roy, Fitzsimmons,
Young, Collins, Wilkins, and
Cleator had stiff opposition from
teams like Leeds Manchester and
Nottingham, and individuals like
Briault, Johnson and Turner.
That year saw the entry of the
great Herb Elliot; competing in
what must have been his last
serious race before studies and
controversy about his amateur
status caused his premature re-
tirement from athletics. I.C.'s
victory was largety \lue to the
inspired running of John Cleator
on the last lap—taking over 37
sees, down on Leeds he produced
the third fastest lap of the day to
take the lead in the last half-mile.
Well-Known Starters
It is customary to invite_some
famous athletics personality to
start the race. In the past we have
had such people as Pat Sage,
Jack Crump, Martin Lucking
(Empire shot-put champion),
Brian Hewson (Great Britain's
best half-miler for many years),
and last year Robbie Brightwell
(European 440 yds. record holder)
—though his false start of last
year can i>nly be described as
unfortunate.
A race of this magnitude re-
quires an immense amount of
organisation and I can think of
no better way to end an article
on the Hyde Park than by paying
tribute to its organisers. The
work of these tireless people oc-
cupies almost a full 12 months;
starting soon after one years race
and culminating in a fever of ac-
tivity and worry at the next
Records-but not enough
Yes! I.C. does actually possess
a record library, but what a
Library! Only 200 records and
a great many of them in an un-
playable condition. Hie reason of
course, is that the Musicai Society
have not had enough money to
finance the Library. However,
the purpose of this article is
neither to moan about the
quantity and quality of the records
nor to cry out for something to
be done, because something is
being done. But first, what is a
a decent library?
Such a library exists to enable
people to indulge in musical ap-
preciation at minimal cost to
themselves; few people can afford
to purchase all the records they
just want to play through a few
times. Evidently a record library
must possess recordings of all the
better known works and musi-
cians plus a great number of
lesser known works before it can
possibly cater for the tastes of the
majority of music lovers. Ideally
I.C. needs a library of some 600-
700 records which should be run
on the same lines as the Haldane
library, where incidentally it is
now housed, (a student cannot be
expected to cope with such a
library without experience).
With the increasing number of
people in Hall it is becoming more
and more desirable that there
should be a good record library
in the College and to this end
some 40 new records have been
purchased with more to come. It
is hoped that money will be pro-
vided to keep the library expand-
ing as well as replacing worn out
records; in three or four years
time there should then be a record
library of 600 records, all in
decent order. The only remaining
question is, will students use it?
—they most certainly should and
for those who don't know, you
can borrow records at the nominal
fee of Is. per week, with a £1
deposit to join the library which
is open all weekdays (including
lunch hours) in the Haldane
Library.
