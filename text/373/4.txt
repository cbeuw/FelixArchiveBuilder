TIME A N D again, in conversations with postgraduates from a
number of departments, I have been confronted with tales of
complete disillusionment with their projects and supervisors.
No postgraduate can openly complain about his project, because
of his total dependance on the supervisor for the degree. The
system is such that no matter
what, the i nd i vidual postgraduate
is bound to lose. In spite of
t h i s , I feel that the postgraduate
group should openly confront
this issue. In doing so, I want
to make it clear that we do not
seek a confrontation with the
academic staff. A l l we w i s h to
do i s to d i s c u s s w a y s and
means of improving the e x i s t i n g
system.
It has been suggested to me
that a charter on postgraduate
research work should be drawn
up and presented to the c o l l e g e
authorities. Presumably among
the points that could be put
forward are:
1. The total responsibility
should rest with the supervisor
for providing the student with
a research subject.
2. A certain amount of pre-
liminary research should have
already been carried out to
certify the feasibility of work
on that topic.
3. The supervisor should keep
in touch and be aware of the
state of the student's research.
4. Possibly greater help
should come from the technical
staff in setting up the necessary
apparatus.
Any such charter should be
binding on both student and
supervisor. The points raised
here are mainly for d i s c u s s i o n .
T h e best way to t a c k l e the
issue would be for the initial
d i s c u s s i o n to be carried out at
departmental groups level,
with the IC postgraduate group
d i s c u s s i n g it at a general
meeting sometime in the middle
of the term — hopefully the final
draft of the charter can be
formulated at t h i s meeting.

The question of whether the
P G Affairs Officer (who is a l s o
chairman of the IC Postgraduate
Group) should be a member of
the Union exec or not, is
finally coming up at the U G M .
A number of postgraduates
have complained to me about the
lack of adequate representation
within the U n i o n , and some
have been in favour of a 'go
it alone' p o l i c y . I am totally
opposed to this s i n c e I feel
that we stand to gain a lot by
working within the framework
provided by I C U . However, the
full benefits cannot and w i l l
not be felt unless postgraduates
are w i l l i n g to take a more active
part in Union affairs. Although
last year's Union executive
tended to ignore postgraduates
this year's e x e c have been
more favourably d i s p o s e d .

Now to write about
thing more interesting!
Dunning and the girls
been complaining about the way
the fellows (namely the under-
grads) treat them. I sympathise
with their feelings and what's
more, shall suggest a solution
to their problems. T h e solution
comes in the form of postgrads.
They are more mature, more
intelligent, more tolerant, more
unders tanding,moreaffec tion a t e,
more perceptive, more loving
and altogether more desirable
creatures than undergrads.
There are 1600 of them at IC,
and although half of them are
married or living with girl-
friends, it still leaves BOO of
them to choose from. So girls,
ignore the undergraduate rabble,
and start associating with real
men.

T.M. &
STUDENT LIFE
A student's life is good, but there Is just one drawback -
having to study. There are many p o s s i b i l i t i e s open to us and
a l s o requirements which we have to fulfill. The main question is
how to make full use of our own potential as students: How to
find the best parties, the cheapest bars; to manage with the
grant; and obviously how to
succeed in exams with the
least work p o s s i b l e .
So, what does all this have
to do with Transcendental
Meditation (TM)? From the
experience of over 300 students
who learnt the technique of T M
in the last 3-4 years in IC and
from the experience of over
8,000 students who have learnt
T M from a l l over E n g l a n d , it
seems that there are many
benefits for students. A n d the
proof is that more and more
students are learning it, most of
them because of a 'meditating'
friend. What are the benefits?
Mainly they fit into three
categories: the mind, health
and s o c i a l life.
For the mind, i t ' s found that
after practising T M for 15-20
minutes twice a day, thinking
ability and organisation of
memory improve considerably.
T h i s means that one can learn
things e a s i l y and in a short
time. Students c l a i m that a s a
result of practising T M , learning
becomes such an automatic and
spontaneous thing — they c a n
concentrate without any real
effort. (The technique is
effortless and doesn't demand
any concentration). These
claims agree with the s c i e n t i f i c
research done on students
which indicates: increased
intelligence growth rate,
increased learning a b i l i t y ,
improved academic performance
etc.
.The second type of benefit
is in- the, field of health. IC
meditators' say that they are
more relaxed, l e s s i l l and feel
fresh and alert throughout the
day. T h i s enables them to enjoy
the bar, parties, or just s i t t i n g
quietly indoors and listening to
music or watching T V .
The last category into w h i c h
the benefits f a l l i s s o c i a l
relationships. Meditators find
that they feel better about
themselves and therefore their
attitude towards others improves.
Not only do they find improve-
ments in their relationships
with their own c o l l e g e friends
but a l s o with members of the
opposite sex (ask the girls who
come to the T M Soc parties).
C e l i a and R o s a l i n d , two
beautiful girls who teach T M
in the college, tell us from their
experience that T M cjin be
learnt by everyone. C e l i a told
me: 'Anyone who can think
can meditate' and according to
her, the benefits are immediate
and don't require years of
practice.
