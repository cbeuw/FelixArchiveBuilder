No. 373 F R I D A Y , 10th J A N U A R Y , 1975
A GUILDED D A Y E Y !
I N T H E early hours of Tuesday (7th January) morning an
intrepid band of Guildsmen led by a person referring to himself a s
the D O C T O R executed the first and amazing mascot relieving
stunt of 1975, by making off with R o y a l School of Mines mascot,
Davey.
' — t h e y left a c a l l i n g c a r d ? ' .
The extent of this com-
mando styled m i s s i o n may be
judged by the fact that it took
them three weeks to p l a n ,
prepare and carry out the
operation, the p r i n c i p a l s
involved being their locksmith'
and 'heavy movement' depart-
ments. They had to go through
some locked doors and a locked
steel cabinet before being able
to remove the sought after
mascot. They achieved this
entry without breaking any of
the l o c k s . In a truly great
s t y l e , they left a c a l l i n g card?
(A C h r i s t m a s card no less!).

Newspaper, i s i n difficulties
concerning a spoof advertise-
ment placed in the November
12th i s s u e , a report having
been p l a c e d before the Director
of P u b l i c Prosecutions ( D P P ) .
The advert in question was
printed as part of a full page
which c a l l e d for the A r m y ' s
withdrawal from Northern
Ireland. The advert was a spoof
of a genuine army recruitment
ad printed in the October 29th
edition, u s i n g the same layout.
Selections include: as an
'Army Officer' you w i l l have a
good chance of becoming dead
a lot sooner .you c a n
a l w a y s blame any mistakes
— o n the workers, and shoot
them.
A conservative member of the
college, Robert Ingram , i s
reported to have sent copies to
members of the Government and
Shaddow Cabinet as w e l l a s
the D P P . Ministers are reported
angry. The report of the D P P
is awaited.
' L a d i e s and gentlemen '•
A note entitled 'W.H.O.
HAS DAVEY!' was sent to the
'Ladies and Gentlemen of City
and Guilds College' by the
D O C T O R . In it he gave an
outline of what happened and
t i l l now a detailed account i s
not a v a i l a b l e . Suffice to say
they w i l l be demanding a
ransom w h i c h 'will obviously
go to a good charity'.
' F E L I X contacted John
Mortimer, President of R S M U .
i When asked about the
disappearance 'of Davey h i s
comment was 7 don't believe
in rumour but I shall investigate'.

it w i l l be considered together

Voluntary Levy
T H E U N I O N has i s s u e d a
leaflet informing h a l l residents
of the voluntary levy of 35p
per week included i n hall fees.
T h e object of this levy i s to
r a i s e money for the Student
A d d i t i o n a l R e s i d e n c e F u n d .
Despite it being U n i o n p o l i c y to
have a levy, C o u n c i l agreed
that students should be free to
decide i n d i v i d u a l l y whether they
wish to pay this levy.
U n i o n h a s a s k e d on a number
of o c c a s i o n s that the levy be
itemised separately on b i l l s .
T h i s was agreed by C o l l e g e but
apparent administrative dif-
f i c u l t i e s have a r i s e n which the
U n i o n is trying to resolve.
It has been c l a i m e d by some
students that the levy i s
entirely u s e l e s s and an un-
necessary f i n a n c i a l burden, as
at present rates of inflation
the fund cannot be built up
q u i c k l y enough ever to finance
the b u i l d i n g of a new h a l l , v i z .
the failure of the Northside
project.
Union suggests that residents
reserve payment until at the
earliest, Monday, January 13th.
