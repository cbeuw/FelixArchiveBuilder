Robert Phillips (Ed.): Aspects of
Alice (Penguin).
IF I were taking bets on it, I'd reckon
that you had read Alice's Adventures in
Wonderland and Through the Looking
Glass at some time in the past. Y o u may
have read them recently, but most probably
you remember them from some time ago.
Anyway, y o u ' l l know what I'm talking
about, for no other books have had such a
pervasive influence on the E n g l i s h idiom
or played as great a part in convincing
outsiders that the E n g l i s h are nuts. If you
haven't read them recently, get hold of a
copy and do it now, preferably after
thumbing through a copy of 'Aspects of
Alice'. After a l l , did you on your first
reading appreciate the pun when A l i c e is
introduced to a leg of mutton? She im-
mediately a s k s the Red Queen if she s h a l l
cut her a s l i c e .
'Certainly not', answers the Red
Queen, 'it isn't etiquette to cut anyone
you've been introduced to'.
â€¢ Aspects of Alice points out this and
many more references to Victorian up-
bringing and childhood, gives in full the
forgotten poems which L e w i s Carroll
parodied, and throws a deal of light onto
Charles L.Dodgson. It really is worth its
weight in gold; not just for the spread and
scope of the e s s a y s , the information
presented and the carefully annotated
notes, but for its intrinsic value a s first
c l a s s c r i t i c i s m .
The opinions of the various authors
could not differ more widely, and range
from whether the A l i c e books were really
written by Mark T w a i n to analogies with
the acid-taking experience. A n d i n -
between we find J . B . P r i e s t l e y ' s c a u s t i c
remarks on Humpty Dumpty. Walter de la
Mare's careful and thought-provoking
review, and s t a c k s of conjectures from
Freudian hang-ups, phallie and pigs to
Don Quixote.
Personally I found myself most in
agreement with R . L . G r e e n in his s e n s i b l e
assessment of what L e w i s Carroll was
trying to do. A s he s a y s , extremely
careful allegory is not the work of the
subconscious mind, and although I would
be the first to agree that there is much of
C . L . D o d g s o n ' s life in Carroll, most of the
attempts (and there have been so many)
to relate A l i c e to anything are difficult to
swallow the day after, however convincing
they appear on the first reading.
Whole Earth Epilog (Penguin)
IF Y O U have seen the Last Whole
Earth Catalog, then you've seen the
Epilog. The same format, another folky
story that I couldn't be bothered to read
and a few rudies to shock the sort of
people who l i k e to give educational
Christmas presents. A s someone is quoted
as a s k i n g : 'Are you guys the symptom or
cure? Put it another way, there war,
nothing wrong with dinosaurs, was there?'.
Having said that, I must confess that
there is a deal of useful information in the
Epilog (like the Catalog), and that I enjoy
just leafing through. Lots of ideas, which
are what count, but s t i l l inevitably
American stuff, so hard for us to get hold
of without paying astronomical freight
charges.
I hope that we aren't going to see an
Epilog year (Too much, man), but it would
be great to have an European version.
Is Bath working on it?
One last injunction: don't be put off bv
the cover, get yourself a copy and keep
it within reach because this is a book
that y o u ' l l want to keep dipping into for a
long time to come.
