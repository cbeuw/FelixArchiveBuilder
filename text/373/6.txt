Jack L l e w e l l y n
Planxty: Cold Blow and the Rainy
Night (Polydor).
THIS H A S to be one of the best
c o l l e c t i o n s of Irish folk tunes around at
the moment. Each reel, polka, air and j i g
have an enormous depth of character: the
lyrics seem to step right out of the
pages of the last century and the music
has the magical charm of a leprechaun,
little hat a n ' a l l . I have become totally
engrossed with this record ever since I
first played it, for each track has such a
sparkling ring of olde worlde exuberance
that it becomes difficult to close one's
mind to the melodies long after the stereo
has been switched off.
Some of the best quts include Johnny
Cope (a song & horn pipe). Cold Blow
&c (the title track) and The Little
Drummer; but undoubtedly the best of a l l
is the last track The Green Fields of
Canada which as an emigration song, is
unusual in as much that the emigre
appears to believe that he has done the
right thing. It is slow, introspective and
lyrically moving with the guitar playing
a haunting melody supported by beautiful,
almost indigeneously Irish harmony.
Fleetwood Mac: Heroes Are Hard To
Find (Reprise).
THIS IS Fleetwood M a c ' s first album
since they decided to settle in L o s
Angeles permanently and although the
advertising blurb says that it '...is more
complex in its concept than anything
they've done before', I fail to see how
F M c a n be categorised as anything other
than conventional.
However, there are definite signs that
the band has set its sights on a broader
scope a s regards presentation. Several
of the tracks try to break away from the
told intro-verse'Chorus-verse-chorus-end
triteness and even drummer Mick F l e e t -
wood showed us that h e ' s capable of more
than the usual thump-diddy-thump on
tracks such as S a d L o s e r and Safe
Harbour.
M e l o d i c a l l y , the Mac have always
been pretty strong and side two must
rate as a triumph in anybody's books:
She's Changing Me, Silver Heels and
e s p e c i a l l y Prove Your Love shine through
as the highlights of the album.
BOOKS
Richard Adams: Watership Down
(Penguin).
THIS* IS a beautiful book, destined to
become a c l a s s i c . Its story is beautifully
told bringing the wonder of the E n g l i s h
Countryside with its plants and animals
to life with such vividness that you can
almost smell the grass.
Taken on its simplest level the book
is a fairy story concerning a group of
robbits who decide to leave their warren
Return to Forever featuring Chick
Corea: Where Have I Known You
Before (Polydor).
•WE STARTED Return to Forever
with the Idea of bringing good music to a
lot of people', says C h i c k Corea. A n d
he's damn right. After several years of
hard graft, ironing out the inevitable
problems of technique in e l i t i s t s e c l u s i o n ,
this group have naturally fused into a
jazz combo of the highest quality. Having
satisfied their art-for-art's-sake ambitions
and established their credentials in
contemporary terms they kick off their
onslaught into the world of jazz with a
new premise: to communicate with their
audiences rather than have them analyse
the m u s i c .
Drummer Lenny White achieves some
astounding entries — practically ghosting
out of nowhere with a firm grip on the
tempo whilst the almost legendary b a s s i s t
Stanley C l a r k e continues substantiating
his p o s i t i o n as Melody Maker. J a z z
b a s s i s t of 1974. The newest member of
the group, A l DiMeola, emphasises h i s
competence on the guitar and the big C
himself shows just what keyboard
virtuosity is a l l about.
Rarified improvisational fusion?
Bullsh. This i s a new slant on j a z z .
It's good.
Barclay James Harvest: Barclay
James Harvest Live (Polydor).
B A R C L A Y J A M E S H A R V E S T must be
one of the few groups around who are
capable of reproducing the excellence of
a studio recording on a live recording, for
try though I might, I could detect very
few 'bum' notes and hardly any mis-
match of instrumental tone-balance.
Recording engineers can only do so much,
so it is a tribute to B J H ' s professionalism
that this double-album is so acoustically
superb.
Several of the tracks (including The
Great 1974 Mining Disaster, Negative
Earth, Paper Wings, For No One and
Crazy City) are taken from their last
album 'Everyone is Everybody Else'.
However, if you prefer songs which are
extended, extemporised and developed to
the full a s opposed to the clipped,
commercial 3'A minute spiel then this
album is definitely worth checking out.
R i c h a r d W a r i n g
and undertake the hazardous journey to
found a new colony. The adventures they
have on the way, their s u c c e s s , their
search for does, and the eventual outcome
a l l follow naturally and believably.
On a higher level allegorical inter-
pretations are possible. A s an example,
the way 'our heroes' act towards other
rabbits they encounter mirrors human
behaviour and ideals. Wj 1

Graham Central Station: Graham
Central Station (Warner Bros).
THIS R E C O R D leaves me completely
in two minds. After listening to the first
side iron-willed determination was
required in order to prevent the formation
of a localised concentration of p l a s t i c
somewhere in the region of P r i n c e ' s
Gardens. Nevertheless, side two was a
relevation indeed: 'Tis Your Kind of
Music has a synthesiser introduction,
played by the band's leader, Larry
Graham, which shows a depth of maturity
in the concept of 'funk'; and the final
track, Today, provides one H e r s h a l l
Happiness with the opportunity to
demonstrate h i s confident expertise on
the clarinet. These two tracks stand head
and shoulders above the others, which
might easily be construed as space-
f i l l i n g .
Storming the Southern States at the
present time is a l l very w e l l , but an
album such as this, which is to be
released prior to their B r i t i s h and
European tour, should really have
advertised the band's undoubted talents
(after a l l , their roots are in Sly and the
Family Stone and B i l l y Preston's band)
on a broader spectrum and not present
such banality as side one.
Osibisa: The Best of Osibisa (MCA).
C l e a r l y designed a s a sampler for
listeners new to O s i b i s a rather than a
collector's item, The Best of Osibisa is
a collection of nine tracks from those
O s i b i s a albums produced in 1971-72. The
inimitable sound that is O s i b i s a shines
through effortlessly with this highly
representative s e l e c t i o n .
However, 'criss-cross rhythms that
explode with happiness' can become
approximately painful after a while -
the group never seem able to slow up at
a l l . Most tracks incorporate a tempo
which seems to be obligatorily fast-
moving and one feels that their repertoire
could do with just a small jab of
melancholy at times.
Undoubtedly the best track is
'Beautiful Seven' which uses thunder-
storm sound effects at the beginning plus
a superbly reverberating flute which is
a stunning combination.
A good buy for those uninitiated to
O s i b i s a .
A l l through the book nature is displayed
with great accuracy, almost reverence.
The style is in places almost documentary;
I gained the impression I was reading a
true history. Even the concept of rabbits
communicating as though by speech
seemed quite in place.
I say again: This is a beautifully
written and intensely moving story which
is held together right to the last word by
a powerful imagination that seen forbids
disbelief.
