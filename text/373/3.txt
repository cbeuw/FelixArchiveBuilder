A Discretionary Award? - It's A Dog's Life!
DOWN H E R E in the little o l " mecca of South K e n . , life i s
lived with that mean low down hound, goin' by the name of
Discretion. H e ' s related to what yer might call the Legal Beagle
fam'ly - them that s t i c k s their wet noses into everythm wat
don't concern 'em. Now this dawg is real mean, and when I say
Truth
mean, I mean mean. 1 ruth i s ,
once pon a time he cut a
pretty cute little figure for the
folks round here, kinda way of
life fer us I s'pose, but he
sorta lost h i s green a n '
wrinkled appeal and now he
looks just plain mangy. Why
he was even nick-named L u c k y
fer a time on accounta once
yer had that hound on yer t a i l ,
yer luck w a s i n . Gals at IF
recall when yer could live in
near oppclence when Discretion
was about but now that dawg
don't give nuttin' away, he
ain't nuttin' but bad luck.
Course, he ain't mean ta
everwan, just those that he
don't fancy (which is plain
near everwan I reckon), that's
why h e ' s called D i s c r e t i o n ,
see? H e can just as easy bite
the hand wat feeds him a s the
one he don't like the smell of.
Pursonally, I put the blame on
his o l ' master L E A . Y e r know,
time w a s when L e a loved that
dawg like he w a s h i s o w n ,
give him awl the best cuts
and s a w that that critter w a s
right propurly fed, e v ' n patted
him in publik (and that d i d
L e a ' s image no end o' good
'cos thar ain't nuttin' folks
like s o much as an anmal-
lover) but tragedy i s that now
L e a ain't got no time fer that
dawg â€” too busy countin' h i s
pennies I s'pose, o l ' god gold
has takin hold, yer might s a y ,
an' thrown hurl i n' sterl in"
right outta the winder, leavin'
yer poor o P Discretion with
just the left-overs. Why that
dawg i s so hungry he chews
great holes in f o l k s ' pockets. '
Course, a s ever, i t ' s us h i l l y -
f i l l i e s here at I F w a t are
sufferin' the most, on accounta
that hound i s s e e k i n ' fer to get
back at u s . H e ' s an-eyein' up
all our ankles just s o ' s he can
bite ' e m . That dawg's meanness
ain't gonna end fer a long time
t'come.

FIONA CASS1DY. a second-

very strong opposition, she

We wish her every future
success.

straightening your mouth and
considering the very real
problems posed by the
Discretionary Award System?
A l l grants of this nature are
grossly unjust because as there
is no national policy stipulating
that L E A ' s should make such an
award available in s u c h and
such a c a s e , there c a n be no
hard and fast rules regarding
the award itself. Of course a s
it is left to the whim of the L E A ,
who under the present squeeze
is rather obliged to follow the
Government's example in cutting
educational expenditure, one
may imagine that discretionary
awards are the first to be
affected.
Many LEA's flatly refuse to
offer discretionary awards to
girls at IF and it seems that as
this trend is catching on more
and more potential applicants
are looking elsewhere. At present
there are 200 girls at IF as
compared with 250 last year.
Whilst one may argue that we-
are not entitled to an award as
substantial as the university
grant, one must point out that
the vast majority of girls at IF
fulfill university entrance
requirements.
It is undoubtedly true that
because of its situation, because
of the duration and the high
standard of the course and a
number of other combining
factors, the Institut F r a n c a i s
is one of the most expensive
courses of its type. However,
by withdrawing or cutting back
on financial a i d to the students
here, the L E A ' s are jeopardising
the very existence of the
Institut F r a n c a i s , and con-
sequently the quality of the
future bi-lingual and multi-
lingual secretary.
In a country currently riddled
with economic crises and
increasingly dependentonstrong
diplomatic and economic
relations with abroad, it is
essential that the LEA's
cease to regard us as liabiIities
and look on us as the invest-
ments that we are, for
international communication,
which we at IF are dealing in,
is at the very basis of our
country's future survival.
