O V E R T H E period of the Christmas vacation, the IC G l i d i n g
C l u b continued to function albeit in a somewhat bloated fashion.
A t the home aerodrome of L a s h a m , a novices course was
organised with the result that two more 'ab initio' p u p i l s have
joined the ranks of solo p i l o t s (and thus qualified for the A/B
certificate _ of the F.A.I.).
Prior to the course, another
p i l o t went s o l o , but as he
already p o s s e s s e d a P P L
(private p i l o t s licence) for
powered aircraft, one c o u l d
hardly c l a s s him a s a novice.
Thanks are due to the instructors
who gave their time to run the
course.
Meanwhile, the s o - c a l l e d
pundits, took the Skylark
(No. 296) on an expedition to
Scotland to h i l l and wave soar.
Despite the fact that Christmas
day was spent peering into the
mirk with high winds and heavy
rain l a s h i n g the clubhouse,
some flying was done by a l l
during the week. T h e B i s h o p
H i l l at Portmoak provided
several hours of h i l l soaring,
and the northerly winds on
B o x i n g day enabled some wave
flying to be undertaken.
Thanks are due to our hosts at
Portmoak aerodrome who not
only allowed us to fly 296, but
alwo their Swallow and P i r a t .

O C T O B E R 18th saw the Canoe C l u b set out on its first major
trip of the term, the annual trip to the river Wye at Symonds Yat.
We arrived at midnight, 2 hours ahead of schedule, and tried to
find the grassiest bit of mud to pitch the tents on. Saturday
morning, w e l l before sunrise we arose and, after several hours of
hesitation, took to the water.
We then paddled upstream to
the roaring waters of Symonds
Y a t rapid (Grade I). Most of the
day was spent introducing new
members to the underwater view
of the rapid. During Saturday
night the river rose a foot or so
and on Sunday the rate of
c a p s i z e had greatly increased.
A n overall c a p s i z e rate of 75%
w a s achieved.
On Saturday the9thNovember,
eleven canoes and ten people
p i l e d into a van and drove to
Bedford for the Bedford Handicap
L o n g D i s t a n c e R a c e . We arrived
early enough to give ourselves
two hours to find the start.
T h i s turned out to be the most
difficult part of the race, but
we eventually located a group
of wet looking canoeists
listening to the course briefing.
T h e race was started with the
slowest boats (under-16 girls)
off first and the fastest (Senior
K2) leaving almost half an hour
later. We a l l set off i n our
respective c l a s s e s , through the
new cut, to the-first wier where
two of the team had a quick
s w i m . Much refreshed they
carried on and a couple of wiers
later found a s c o u t s ' canoe
blocking a lock shute, forcing
most people to portage. The
race ended after two more wiers
and a few more m i l e s . B o b
Joce won and T i m Perry came
third i n senior c l a s s 3 and
D i a n a came second i n L a d i e s
slalom. The rest of the results
are not yet available .
A week later we set off on
our annual trip to the river E x e
for the E x e Descent race.
A v o i d i n g the many (four) p i l e -
up s on the way, we arrived at
our lodgings and a l l of us
p i l e d into one bed. On Saturday
morning we set off to inspect
the course and pubs. F o u r
people actually went canoeing,
two of them having a pleasant
dip w h i l e experimenting with
rapids. The evening was spent
in the pub and afterwards i n our
communal bed. On Sunday
morning we wandered through a
ploughed field to the start of
the race which was just above
Tiverton. T e n wiers, many
rapids and nineteen miles later
we found the finish. A l l the I C
paddlers finished w e l l up some
finishing rather wetter than
others. Bob Joce managed 7th,
Tim Perry 10th and Dave
Rosenthal 17th out of a record
number of entries. The rest of
the team finished in the top
half of the field. J.Hubbard
( E x . Chem. Eng.) won the
senior K 2 c l a s s again. The
U L U paddlers d i d not do so
w e l l and smashed one of their
two boats i n half.
The next important com-
petition that I C paddlers are
involved i n i s the B r i t i s h
U n i v e r s i t i e s Down R i v e r R a c e
on the Dee. We w i s h them the
best of luck.
We s t i l l
s e s s i o n i n
have a coaching
the pool every
Tuesday 6.30 - 8.00p.m. A l l
