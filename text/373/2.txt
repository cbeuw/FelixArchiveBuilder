M i c h a e l W i l l i a m s
Y E T A N O T H E R bumptious term
. grinds into motion. T h i s one inevitably
has to be l e s s exuberant, l e s s en-
thusiastic, l e s s energetic than the first
term, for now i s the time that many
students realise that their academic
work i s the fundamental reason why
they are at TC in the first place. Now is
the time to be devouring that back-log
of problem sheets and f i n a l i s i n g that
project before writing it up. It's a p a i n ,
I know, but i t i s a necessary torture
which we a l l have to go through.
But w h i l s t many are resolved to p i n
their proverbial shoulder to the grind-
stone there are others with their minds
on other things such as the contribution
they feel they are capable of making to
the U n i o n year p o s s i b l y as a member of
the Union hierarchy.
Towards the end of this term some
hardy souls w i l l vie for the four U n i o n
posts which are elected by means of a
college-wide ballot. The posts are the
President, Deputy President, Hon.
Secretary and the Editor of F E L I X .
A l l except the D P are sabbatical w h i c h
means that the post becomes a full-
time job for a year with no academic
work. E a c h post i s open to any full
member of I C U with the exception that
no sabbatical officer can stand for
another sabbatical.
Now is the time to consider the
p o s s i b i l i t y of standing not only for these
posts but for each and every post that
e x i s t s i n this U n i o n .
Do not be put off by those whose minds
are already made up and who wish to
publicise that fact.
Regarding the alleged attitude of the
N U S to the I R A , does it not strike
anyone at a l l odd that w h i l s t vehemently
denying that the N U S supported the I R A ,
Mr. John R a n d a l l the President, did not
take any initiative whatsoever to con-
demn the recent I R A bombings? The
opportunity for him to do so was there
but he did not take it. A g a i n one must
express one's curiosity at the fact that
much of the N U S p o l i c y on the Irish
situation coincides with the aims of the
I R A .
' But before a l l the IC lefties jump up
and throw their arid eloquence at me,
let me just say that I'm not condemning
John R a n d a l l — I'm just not taking the
opportunity to support him.
Beit Hall,
Jan 6th, 1975.
Dear Sir,
In this year of high inflation
it i s n i c e to know there i s
something else free besides
fresh air.
i We used to pay for F E L I X ,
yet now he i s free and more
handsome. H a v i n g known F E L I X
a l l h i s life, and followed him
through many changes, I w i s h to
congratulate you on his 25th
anniversary colourful edition.
I am s t i l l in p o s s e s s i o n of many
o l d editions of F E L I X .
• After I was demobbed from
the army at Christmas 1945, I
came to B e i t H a l l i n January
1946, as a porter. I was
introduced to the cleaning
staff, and s i x months later
married one of them.
PARKING
There are s t i l l people who
have not collected their parking
permits. If these are not
collected before the end of
January they w i l l be forfeitted
and the places reallocated.
i My wife started at O l d B e i t
in 1926, and i s s t i l l working at
B e i t H a l l with me. We have been
very happy working with the
students, and s h a l l m i s s them
very much when we retire i n
the not-too-distant future. We
have seen great changes i n
student dress, appearance,
moods etc., but a l l through the
years we have found them most
courteous and respectful to us.
i I have a mention i n your
article by Dave Salisbury '25
Years of Residence', John Owen
would clean shoes for 6d. and
sponge and press suits for
l / 6 d . The name i s not John
Owen but John Roden and 3d.
a p a i r was charged for shoes,
2/6d. charged for pressed
dinner s u i t s .
i M i s s Sherwood who we
worked with many years was a
wonderful lady and a great
a s s e t to the smooth running of
B e i t H a l l . She was much
concerned with the welfare of
the students, e s p e c i a l l y the
girls.
i L o n g live F E L I X .
Yours sincerely,
J . Roden.
