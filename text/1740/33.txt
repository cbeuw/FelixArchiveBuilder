Everyone as an Investor: Why you should be one

hough this be
madness, yet
there is method
in’t.

The semantics behind
the word investor has
come to be as one of a
full-time profession, and
adjective that could be
shared by common people
that an investor is a fat cat
with with bells ﬂoating
out of his Bentley whilst
he jumps out for a meeting
with the City of London
Corporation. What it
should mean is a person
of certain characters and
qualities, and those those
who can sacriﬁce now to
gain later. Acts on logic,
and not emotions. Makes
a plan, and sticks to it.
Strategy can be applied
to any scary source, but
when applied to money we
are thinking about putting
close on one back. True to
the original deﬁnition, and
that is of the latin word in-
vesterie, to clothe oneself.
So, if you are wearing
clothes right now you
are in a very good place
to start being an investor.
Otherwise, go and put
some clothes on and
come back to this article.
And try to convince you
of why you should be an
(active) investor from this
moment onwards.
Investing vs. Gambling
Word “investing” is
being thrown around
however, especially in
case when things have
nothing to do with invest-
ing but everything with
chance. Speculation, is not
investing. What shows it
amazingly is a scene from
South Park E3S13 (great
episode), where Stan puts
his $100 cheque into his
bank to “grow” without
any plan or investigation
into process:
“We can put that
check in a money-market
mutual fund, then we’ll
reinvest the earnings into
foreign-currency accounts
with compounding
interest aaaaaaand it’s
gone!” Poof, it’s gone.
Sadly to many people
investing appears to
be exactly that, putting
money through ﬁnancial
mechanism with an op-
portunity of (probable)
reward. The truth, unless
you’re a High Frequency
Trader… you’ll end up
like Stan. What investing
actually is, is owning a
piece of business. And
Stan didn’t try to look into
healthy businesses that
might be undervalued and
will grow within the next
ﬁve to ten years. He just
wanted “money to grow”,
well money doesn’t grow
on trees and neither it
does in a bank account. If
Stan instead invested his
money into a business he
might know of enough to
make a decision to support
he would end up differ-
ently. Like video games.
Virtual reality has been
coming to our homes for
ages, with game studios
like NVIDIA working
on it. If Stan bought 11
stocks at $7.98 and paid
$10 in fees spending his
$100 (not a great strategy
to spend everything on a
single stock, but Stan is
just a child), aaaaaaaand
forgot about it till Oculus
rift hits the shelves and
rises to popularity in 2018.
He would have $3036
worth in stock. That’s the
difference between invest-
ing and speculating.
How to start
It has never been
simpler than now, you
just Google “how to buy
stocks” and here you have
it. Back in the day you
would need to call in to
a broker, which would
then not only try to sell
stocks to you Wolf-of
-Wall street style but also
take a commission for
everything you’ll try to do
on top of basic costs. But
going beyond the practical
aspect, as little as £20 will
sufﬁce to start and gain
the experience. Yes there
are simulators, but it’s
crazy how differently we
behave when real money
is at stake. If you can
play the stock market like
a video game, with no
emotions just by looking
at numbers you’re a nat-
ural-born investor whos is
better than Warren Buffet.
However 99.9% of us
will have to sadly learn
for ourselves. It’s a bit
like gardening, it’ll take
few years to see result
of your decisions. So the
earlier you start the better.
Once you decide to
invest, you’ll have to
think about what kind of
investor you want to be:
passive or aggressive. By
doing a lot of research
(start with: Investopedia,
Intelligent Investor by
Benjamin Graham and of
course joining appropriate
College societies) and
think on how committed
you can be.
How do we benefit?
Well, most importantly
money invested is distrib-
uted well. It’s not hanging
out within the ﬁnancial
mechanisms but is being
targeted for appropriate
businesses individuals
consider worth supporting
which then can perform
well through the use of
these funds.
Giving back to its
investors but also increas-
ing quality of service
to everyone else. But
the biggest change, one
would say is the societal
one. Act of investment,
as described in future
instalments, is part of
ones character. Sacriﬁcing
now, to gain later by
thinking of the future. A
personal quality that’s
best acquired through
investing.
