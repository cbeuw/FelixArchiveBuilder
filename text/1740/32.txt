Macro-Economics VS Micro-Economics
attempts to model human
behaviour using math-
ematics. As is often the
case in physical sciences
and engineering, certain
assumptions must be
made. The main ones
include that individuals
have full knowledge
about the goods avail-
able and make rational
purchasing decisions, the
number of buyers and
sellers are inﬁnite and that
goods are homogenous,
i.e. they closely resemble
their competition. These
models can lead to the
formulation of theories
about various types of
economic events within
a given market. These
hypotheses must then be
tested in practice, through
empirical research, which
involves the collection
and analysis of economic
data from real-world
markets.
Microeconomics has
given rise to several
theories which seek to
explain how the market
operates. The most promi-
nent ones are listed below:
Production Theory:
It seeks to explain how
a business decides how
much it will produce of the
commodity that it intends
to sell. A ﬁrm must select
the appropriate combina-
tion of productive factors,
which include land, raw
materials, and human
labour, among others, for
this purpose.
Laws of Supply and
Demand: According to the
Law of Demand, provided
all other factors do not
change, a higher price for
a commodity will reduce
the demand for it. The
Law of Supply states that
the supplied quantity of
a product will increase if
the price is increased.
As seen in the graph
above, the downward
sloping curve of the Law
of Demand intersects the
upward curve of the Law
of Supply at a single point.
That point is referred to
as the equilibrium price,
which allows the supplier
to sell their product at a
price considered accept-
able by buyers.
Macroeconomics
The publication of John
Maynard Keynes’s The
General Theory of Em-
ployment, Interest and
Money in 1936 highlight-
ed the difference between
the two ﬁelds of economic
study. It sought to explain
the effects of the Great
Depression and in doing
so, it demonstrated that
microeconomic concepts
could not simply be ex-
tended in order to explain
the entire economy.
Macroeconomics analyses
the behaviour of factors,
such as the growth rate,
unemployment and the
Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) which inﬂuence
the economy’s perfor-
mance. GDP refers to the
FELIX
collective monetary value
of all products and ser-
vices produced in a coun-
try in the span of a year.
Achieving development,
which will hopefully re-
sult into increased living
standards is considered
the main goal of this disci-
pline. Macroeconomic re-
search is divided into two
types: long-term econom-
ic growth and the business
cycle.
Economic Growth
Economic development
is linked to an increase
in the total production in
a country’s economy. It
is therefore essential to
investigate which factors
may lead to a slowdown or
an acceleration of growth.
Before the 20th
century, macroeconomic
analysis regarding growth
revolved around quali-
tative arguments, such
as those found in Adam
Smith’s An Inquiry into
the Nature and Causes
of the Wealth of Nations,
which formed the basis
of capitalism. Since the
start of the last century,
macroeconomists have
developed formal mathe-
matical models. Growth
frequently appears as
a function of available
capital, labour force and
technical progress.
The term “business
cycle” refers to the
ﬂuctuations in economic
activity which may occur
over a given time period.
Each cycle comprises
of six stages: At ﬁrst,
expansion is associated
with a rise in income,
employment and produc-
tion in an economy. At
some point, growth peaks,
which is then followed
by a period of recession.
During that period,
income, employment and
demand levels decline.
Continued contraction
leads to the depression
stage, which entails more
business closures as well
as reduced investment into
the economy. The trough
stage signals the end of
the depression, which
then paves the way for
the recovery stage. Due to
low prices, according to
the Law of Demand, con-
sumers will begin to spend
more, which will lead to
increased employment
and production levels.
Exit from the recovery
stage marks the end of the
business cycle.
Methods of
Macroeconomics
As previously men-
tioned, ﬁnding the policies
which will help achieve
economic growth is one
of the primary goal of
macroeconomic studies.
This implies a certain a
subset of goals, with some
of the most important
ones being:
Sustainability: The
growth rate achieved
permits increased living
standards without adverse
environmental effects
Full employment:
All individuals who are
willing and able to work
have managed to secure
employment, which does
not necessarily mean zero
unemployment. Several
economists argue that a
certain rate of unemploy-
ment will always exist.
Price stability: Prices
remain stable for extended
amounts of time. Low-to
moderate inﬂation is
considered ideal for pro-
moting growth. Inﬂation
measures how quickly
does the price of goods
in an economy rise over
a given period of time.
Large rates of inﬂation
are undesirable because
individuals will be able to
purchase fewer products
with the amount of money
available to them, leading
to a decrease in demand.
External balance: The
monetary value of goods
imported in an economy
is roughly equal to the
value of exports in the
long-term.
Macroeconomists have
developed mathemati-
cal models to describe
relationships between
M
i c r o e c o -
nomics and
m a c r o e -
c o n o m i c s
constitute the two main
subgroups of the social
science known as eco-
nomics. Both disciplines
are said to have risen from
“The Wealth of Nations”
by Adam Smith, whose
work as a political phi-
losopher has inﬂuenced
much of the world’s
economic policy choices
since the late 1700s.
numerous factors, such
as inﬂation, unemploy-
ment, consumption, and
investment, among others.
These models rely on
assumptions similar to
the ones mentioned about
microeconomic models,
but also on statistics about
unemployment and GDP.
Comparison
As deduced from the
deﬁnitions of the two
ﬁelds, scale is the main
difference between
them. Microeconomics
focuses on how economic
events inﬂuence the
decision-making of
individuals and ﬁrms,
while macroeconomics
studies their effect on the
economy as a whole. For
example, a shift in the
government’s tax policy
would be of interests
to economists of both
ﬁelds. A microeconomist
will observe the policy’s
impact on producers’
decision making, namely
if they will increase
or decrease production
levels. In contrast, a
macroeconomist will
concentrate on how this
new measure may affect
the living standards of the
general population, i.e. if
they will beneﬁt from this
move or stand to lose.
Conclusion
As already shown,
both microeconomics
and macroeconomics are
essential to understanding
how the economy reacts
to changes in society. One
could argue that macroe-
conomics is much more
prevalent as it shapes
government policy, which
affects everyone in the
end.
However, they would
be wrong given the con-
tinued interaction between
the ﬁelds. For instance, an
increase in house prices
would not only have an
impact on households
and ﬁrms, but also on the
greater economy, consid-
ering the large size of the
housing market in several
countries.

Microeconomics
M i c r o e c o n o m i c s
studies how the behaviour
of economic factors, such
as individuals, households
and ﬁrms, affect the oper-
ation of the market. The
market is deﬁned as any
structure which enables
the sale and purchase of a
product.
It is often thought of
as a physical market, but
that is not necessary if the
sellers and buyers choose
to communicate remotely
in order to complete the
transaction. When refer-
ring to the functioning of
the market, economists
are mainly interested
in the prices, supply,
and demand for goods.
This ﬁeld focuses on the
operation of individual
market places and how
they interact with each
other, while disregarding
their relationship with
the economy as a whole.
The important question is,
how do microeconomists
develop their theories
to predict the market’s
response to changes in the
production process?
