Binge of the Week: Dracula
N
etflix’s 2020
series retells
the classic
v a m p i r e
fantasy story Dracula by
Bram Stoker, following
Count Dracula’s (played
by Claes Bang) journey
from Transylvania to
England and his attempt
to spread the undead
curse, whilst battling
with the descendants of
Van Helsing. The show
is written by Mark Gatiss
and Steven Moffat, both
previously writers of
BBC’s Sherlock. Needless
to say, they both have
considerable experience
adapting classic stories
into the format of three
90 minutes long episodes.
Each episode gives a
piece of the story while
maintaining a complete,
standalone arc surround-
ing Dracula.
This interpretation
retains many of the classic
elements of the original
version, including Drac-
ula’s encounter with
English solicitor Jonathan
Harker, boarding of the
Demeter ship, arrival in
England and final battle
with Van Helsing. One
main difference is trans-
forming the character of
Professor Abraham Van
Helsing to Sister Agatha
Van Helsing and Dr. Zoe
Van Helsing (both played
by Dolly Wells). Another
difference includes
bringing Dracula to
modern England for his
final confrontations in the
third episode. The plot is
split reasonably into three
parts, the first of which
introduces the infamous
Count Dracula and Van
Helsing, the second details
his journey while building
the rising action, while
the last bringing about the
climax - the final battle
and Dracula’s epiphany.
Logically one would
expect the suspense to
build up as we inch closer
to the season finale,
however, I find the actual
episodes play out to be
almost the exact opposite.
I find the first episode the
most well-written and
executed, slowly declin-
ing with the introduction
of more side characters.
While the writers clarified
that the adaptation would
be both “faithful and faith-
less” as with their other
works, I find that there is
less room for creative de-
velopment with Dracula.
Unlike with Sherlock
where more raw material
is available to begin with,
Dracula features a short,
complete storyline where
not much can be altered.
This is typical of Moffat’s
writing style - wonderful-
ly pretentious but a bit of
an overkill at times.
The ending is a twist
I have not expected and
is in stark contrast to the
original. It feels like a
standoff between a met-
aphorical and a physical
ending. The original work
focuses on the aspect of
vampire-slaying, while
the adaptation features
a mental battle, where
we delve into Dracula’s
past and motivations.
This also takes place in
contemporary England,
with classic characters
like Lucy Westenra
(played by Lydia West),
John Seward (played by
Matthew Beard), and
Quincey Morris (played
by Phil Dunster) adapted
to the 21st century. All
in all, I think the writers
tried to incorporate more
elements than necessary
- leaving the final product
underwhelming, messy,
and too much of a detour.
The shift to modern
England could have been
a nice touch, but 1) the
characters are poorly
adapted - for instance
Lucy has turned into an
unlikeable, self-absorbed
party girl, and 2) the
execution not only lacks
the gothic aura of the late
eighteenth century but
also fails to set the tone
for a horror setting. The
overall mood could have
been more consistent;
the characters could have
been more fleshed-out.
It leaves something to be
desired.
The highlight of the
show for me is the char-
acter of Sister Agatha
Van Helsing - Wells does
an amazing job bringing
life to this witty, sharp-
tongued nun. This is a
successful change of char-
acter, where she was natu-
rally woven into the plot.
A nun in a convent lends
itself nicely to a vampire
story in the late nineteenth
century. The character
is also well-written -
every line she delivers is
precise and/or hilarious.
The titular character
Dracula, as portrayed
by Claes Bang, comes
across ordinary and a little
dull. It’s difficult to play
the single most famous
vampire in the history of
vampires, and this itera-
tion suffers from the lack
of a distinct personality
which can also be attribut-
ed to the writing. It feels as
if Dracula is just another
blood-thirsty vampire
running around searching
for brides, nothing special.
While the moment of
redemption sheds light on
his vulnerability, it does
not exactly align with
the Dracula from the first
two episodes. This may
be controversial but I
find this version of Count
Dracula lackluster and
inconsistent.
The cinematography
is especially crucial
for the genre of horror.
It takes the right shots
and framing techniques
to create spine-chilling
moments that exemplify
the genre. The first two
episodes successfully tap
into our psyche with its
eerie lighting, unexpected
transitions, unique angles.
It’s interesting that the
production team kept flies
as a motif that is fitting and
provides a strong visual.
However, the cinematog-
raphy for the third episode
resembles that of a typical
drama rather than horror -
the lighting, depth of field,
exposure could have been
improved.
There were both ups
and downs in this adap-
tation. Many details were
done right, for example,
teasing of “traditions/
myths” about vampires
was quirky. Sadly the
series started off strong
but finished weakly. For
potential future seasons,
I’m more interested to see
them playing with perhaps
Dracula’s origin story. All
in all, it’s still delightfully
diabolic, and I would rec-
ommend it if you’re in the
mood for some vampire
fantasy drama.
