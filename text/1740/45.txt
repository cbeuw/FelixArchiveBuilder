P
olice raided
a house in
Fulham, West
London late last
night as part of an on-
going operation against
modern slavery gangs.
They freed several mi-
grant workers who had
been kept in subhuman
conditions and forced to
work for nothing under
threat of being reported
to UK Border Force.
Local residents ex-
pressed surprise at waking
up inside a police cordon.
“It looked like a complete-
ly ordinary house. We did
hear shouting and banging
but we thought they were
just IC students like us.”
said Cark Momer.
Slavery is a major
problem in London with
hundreds of nail bars and
massage parlours running
as money laundering op-
erations using a smuggled
workforce to limit the
chance of being discov-
ered.
Police have declared
that the house had poten-
tially been used to keep
migrant workers trapped
for up to 20 years. Detec-
tives have wondered how
so long went by without
the alarm being raised.
Feb Senton, local resident
“Well they did hang a
banner out of the window
but it just had Chinese
characters on it. Obvious-
ly I can’t read Chinese but
they matched the ones on
the ‘Live, Laugh, Love’
tattoo I got around here
last month*. I just figured
they were all really chill
people”
Police confirm that they
are following up leads and
will inform the media
of any further advances
in the case and ask the
public to be extra vigilant
of any hints of suspicious
activity.
Editor’s note:
The banner hung from
the window has been
found to have said ‘Please
help me. I am here against
my will’. Senton has not
responded to requests for
comment.
