n November 2014,
Garrett Borns (stage
name: BØRNS)
released his debut
EP, Candy. The four-track
EP is a dizzyingly sweet
synthpop concoction that
captures Garrett’s iconic
sound. There are big cho-
ruses and playful verses,
which make the whole
album feel like a massive
celebration. Garrett said
that most of his music was
inspired by the ‘60s &
‘70s Playboys, and so it’s
harder to tell if the bubbly
love song, ‘Electric Love’,
is about love or drugs.
Some critics have
compared BØRNS to a
“happier Lorde” or “Owl
City’s music for cool
kids” but the album ef-
fortlessly blends elements
of electro-pop, synth, psy-
chedelic pop, and alt rock
into a highly danceable
blend of catchy hooks and
eclectic, inviting orches-
trations; making BØRNS
the it thing when it comes
to indie pop.
The light pop ‘Electric
Love’ is the first song on
the EP, and it takes the
prize when it comes to
production value, also
BØRNS’s vocals & song-
writing make the song a
complete masterpiece. It
feels like a heartfelt decla-
ration until the song bursts
into a colourful chorus. It
doesn’t quite feel like a
love song, but the song is
dreamy and hook laden.
Although Garrett has been
very honest in his music,
as there are no hidden
themes, ‘Electric Love’
feels highly ambiguous.
Nevertheless, you would
definitely sing along, and
even Taylor Swift deemed
it an instant classic!
‘10,000 Emerald
Pools’, one of the singles
from Candy, has an ex-
emplary bass intro, which
coupled with BØRNS’
harmonies and high
falsetto wail set the tone
for the album, coloured
with the same retro vibes
that characterise his
musical style.
‘Past Lives’ is the third
single on the EP. The song
begins with an a cappella
portion of wonderful
harmonies before a slight
lull springboards into
pounding drums and bass.
The transition feels like
someone ﬂipped a switch
somewhere, as if the
listener were hearing two
separate tracks rather than
one single song. “Lost
love is sweeter when it’s
finally found” is one of
the many verses that make
Garrett an excellent poet
and songwriter.
‘Seeing Stars’ is like
the Naked and Famous,
Passion Pit, and MGMT
have been put into an
ice coffee and blended
together, in H&M. It feels
like jubilant bliss on a
summer’s day, something
that would put a smile on
our face, no matter what.
The whole album feels
like it’s thickly coated
with honey, and Garrett’s
songwriting skills are
golden. The Michigan
singer looks and sounds
like he stepped out of
Velvet Goldmine and
high-fived Lana Del Rey.
Anyone paying close at-
tention to BØRNS’ blend
of synth pop will only
expect good things. On
Candy, BØRNS delivered
by all measures a collec-
tion of masterfully mixed
synth-fueled pop gems.
Vocals and clean song-
writing would be the key
drivers here, with Garrett
Borns’ voice setting a
smooth tone throughout.
He’s stellar on ‘Past
Lives’ and even better on
‘Electric Love’, a track
where his voice oozes an
effortless cool.
Garrett’s eccentric
lilting tenor voice comple-
ments his psychedelic pop
style perfectly. The retro
track, with clever drum
samples and complex bass
and guitar riffs, make the
EP a pleasant musical ex-
perience, but the melodies
could never overpower
BØRNS’ stunning vocals,
which are the star of the
album. His voice possess-
es an immense range and
a smooth, strong falsetto
that never sounds out of
control; he has a sound
that could easily become
iconic. The lyrics them-
selves, already vivid and
expressive, seem all the
more sincere and emo-
tional when carried by his
voice. True to its name,
Candy is a satisfying
listen.
