Hello puzzlers!
Two weeks into term means 2 pages of puzzles (please don’t
expect 3 pages in the next issue, it isn’t happening), and we’re
just that bit closer to doom.
Shout out to crauswords.com (as always) for helping us pro-
duce Sudoku, Shikaku and Minesweeper, and to Quiz Society
for their long awaited trivia. They will be going back to a fort-
nightly schedule, so keep an eye out!
Gogen, too, makes a return - I’ve made it a bit tricky, so have
fun. Try creating some of your own and submitting!
