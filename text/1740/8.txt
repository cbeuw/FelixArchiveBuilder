Why it Hurts to Know History?

H
istory is not a
field that pos-
sesses obvious
social value.
Historians claim that the
study of history allows
people to develop a sen-
sitivity to cognitive biases
and logical fallacies,
imparting perspective,
encouraging prudence
and impelling social ad-
vancement. However, the
strength of these claims
is undermined by the fact
that history often fails to
provide any useful lessons
at all.
When history is
approached from a de-
terministic perspective,
where human independ-
ence of action is denied,
history reinforces moral
ambiguity. It often does
not “relate the right thing
to do in one case or
another” but exemplifies
how “even doing the right
thing rarely works out.”
To blur the boundary
between right and wrong
- good and bad - is to ag-
gravate ethical quandaries
and obscure moral judge-
ments. This may subvert
decent or decisive action
and threaten social justice
and national security. Cer-
tainly, conflicting views
about whether “we ought
to bomb these guys or side
with those guys we were
bombing before,” would
undermine effective gov-
ernance and public safety.
Such a complication of
already complex political,
military interventions may
be inimical to democracy,
as well as domestic and
foreign policy. This affili-
ation of history with moral
ambivalence negates the
historian’s assertion that it
helps to know history.
This sentiment is
reinforced by the notion
of history’s variability.
Some historians believe
that “history...teaches [us]
that it is hard...for anyone
to control, including the
people who think they’re
making it.” The deter-
ministic interpretation
that the present is beyond
human jurisdiction incites
a sense of powerlessness.
The implicit futility of
individual effort promotes
a culture of inaction and
complacency. While
“studying history doesn’t
argue for “nothing-ism,”
this interpretation inad-
vertently does. The belief
that “the best will in the
world” and “the best can-
didates for our support”
can’t alter or better
the course of history.
Examples of this are the
attemptstomanageviolent
unrest. The Mahdi’s
revolt in Sudan against
the British was bolstered
by efforts to erode it;
Middle Eastern terrorism
was amplified by attempts
to eliminate it. The idea
that human endeavours
to divert the trajectory
of pressing social and
political problems were
self-defeating, furthers the
argument that nothing can
be learned from history
except that human actions
are often pointless.
These premises conjure
history’s potential to
excuse recklessness
and ineptitude. When a
deterministic attitude is
applied to the reading of
modern events, it allows
clear cut mistakes to be
characterised as inevita-
ble. For example, when
considering the United
State’s many adventures
in the Middle East, the
characterisation of their
invasions can be de-
scribed as inevitabilities,
essentially “uncontrolla-
ble,” rather than heinous
immoral acts that should
be condemned. Such an
attitude impairs the rec-
ognition and rectification
of individual and official
errors. Thereby, the claim
that we are “made by
history” compels a passive
spectatorship of the
past, present and future,
which stagnates personal
and social innovation.
This is inconsistent with
Gopnik’s claims of histo-
ry’s social utility.
The above advances
the fact that the utility
of history is limited. A
deterministic view of the
past leads to moral “his-
torical blindness.” The
suggestion that “horrible
groups doing horrible
things,” emerge as a result
of the “certain things we...
do” and “[don’t] do” -
that action and inaction
alike inevitably result in
chaos. Thereby, history
is framed as a series of
unruly inevitabilities. This
muddies the motivations
of independent political
actors. It divorces intent
from outcome - Lyndon
B. Johnson’s orchestra-
tion of the Vietnam war
from the “moral and
strategic” atrocities that
followed it. This renders
“catastrophes,” “unin-
tended consequences,”
and rationalises the jux-
taposition of L.B.J with
Obama. This, in lieu of a
“lack of historical sense,”
would cloud humanity’s
view of the world to invite
misinformed civic choices
and misplaced public rep-
resentation. This portrayal
of history and historical
knowledge contradicts
his appraisal of its social
functions.
Accordingly, the
argument against the
reiteration of historical
mistakes is antithetical
to his conception of
history. He maintains that
history is “singular” and
“uncontrollable,” but is
incredulous that humanity
operates in ignorance of
past experience. Some
historians claim that
“no matter how many
interventions are badly
made, the experts who
intervene make more: the
sixteenth-century doctors
who bled and cupped
their patients and watched
them die just bled and
cupped others more.”
This does not demonstrate
that “nothing works out
as planned,” but indicates
an incapacity for effective
planning. That individuals
and organisations re-com-
mit the same errors, with
the benefit of hindsight,
speaks to an intrinsic
human failing rather than
the forces of historical
fate. This description of
history is incompatible
with his appraisal of
human behaviour. This
diminishes the purported
instructive value of
historical knowledge,
and hence, its value to
humankind.
This is furthered by
the assumption of histor-
ical illiteracy. Historians
posits that the cultivation
of a “historical sense”
is the solution to “pre-
sentism,” or the assump-
tion that the events of the
modern day are in some
way special. However,
the deterministic attitude
to history forces the
assertion that “history is
past, and singular, and the
same year never comes
round twice.” If histor-
ical knowledge is, thus,
“uniquely” different, how
can modern day mishaps
be “familiarly difficult?”
Painting past events
as atypical, one-time
occurrences vindicates
the centennial tendency
to “exaggerat[e]...present
problems out of all pro-
portion to those which
previously existed. ”
Indeed, this delineation
of history’s “singularity,”
and uniqueness disputes
its potential to act as a
frame of reference for
current issues and, hence,
alleviate “presentism.”
This self-contradiction
vitiates the validity of
the claim, about history’s
practical advantages to
society.
A deterministic view of
history has the potential
to entrap humanity in an
passive, pacifist cycle of
unresolvable social, po-
litical and moral disputes.
So, does it help to know
history? Probably. But not
with the assumption of
determinism.
