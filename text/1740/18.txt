Onegin
Fix
R
ussian litera-
ture is often
unsuitable for
shorter format
reproductions. How could
one begin to fathom dis-
tilling the multiple facets
of, say, Tolstoy’s War and
Peace into a single movie?
Equally daunting is the
task of bringing to life the
complicated characters of
Alexander Pushkin’s cele-
brated 19th century novel
verse, Eugene Onegin,
through a ballet. But this
is what John Cranko has
achieved (quite master-
fully) in his ballet Onegin,
created for the Stuttgart
Ballet in 1965, and staged
by the Royal Opera House
since 2001.
The ballet is as much
about the eponymous
Onegin as it is about
Tatiana and her internal
struggle to decide between
duty and love. The story
follows Tatiana, a young
girl enthralled by romantic
novels, as she falls in love
with Onegin, a friend of
her sister Olga’s fiancé,
Lensky. Her affections are
spurned by Onegin, who
instead chooses to flirt
with Olga and in doing
so enrages Lensky to a
duel ultimately leading
to Lensky’s death. Years
later, Tatiana and Onegin
cross paths again. Upon
seeing Tatiana, now
married to Prince Gremin,
Onegin realises his
mistake and and declares
his love for her, only this
time to face disappoint-
ment with Tatiana sending
him away.
Natalia Osipova, as
Tatiana, shines in the
production and is equally
convincing as an adoles-
cent girl in Act I as she
is portraying a Russian
princess in Act III. Her
portrayal of a charming
young girl exploring her
affections for Onegin is
one to look out for. Reece
Clarke, playing Onegin
in his debut performance,
brings much grace and
elegance to the role,
wonderfully transitioning
between emoting stoic
indifference and regret.
Other notable perfor-
mances include Francesca
Hayward as Olga and
Mathew Ball as Lensky,
who are both remarkable
in their roles. Hayward in
particular owns the stage
in those few scenes that
she occupies.
The music, arranged
by Kurt-Heinz Stolze
(from works of Pyotr
Ilyich Tchaikovsky) and
conducted by Valery
Ovsyanikov for the pro-
duction, adds a breath of
life to the characters and
their emotional conun-
drums. The choreography
by Cranko is stellar, with
the mirror pas de deux
being a truly remarkable
standout to this day. The
staging, lighting and
costumes need praise
as well, bringing to life
the beautiful settings of
idyllic country life and
grand quarters of Russian
palaces with much ease.
In summary this is a
production that no ballet
enthusiast should miss.
Pushkin’s story, with a
rare central female lead,
deserves revisiting in
today’s day and age. The
production delivers in
every department and
when the sum of the parts
emerges by the end of Act
III, one is left speechless,
much like Tatiana!
J
ulie Tsang’s Fix is
a provocative tale
about a washing
machine repairman,
Kevin, and his battle with
his inner conscience as
he is forced to address
the crimes of his past by
interacting with a mysteri-
ous woman, Li Na, in her
crumbling house in the
woods. A cosy set-up in
the Pleasance Theatre, Fix
is an hour-long morale
piece delving into the
psyche of the guilty.
The intimate seating
and stage arrangement
with a broken washing
machine as the central
prop gave the show an
almost immersive expe-
rience. Starting off as an
amicable chat between a
repairman and the client
and building to an ac-
knowledgment of a dark
past, the show oscillates
from boring to mediocre
as the conversation
meanders its way through
arguments about the
nearest phone booth to a
pet dragon residing in the
top floor.
Fix is a ravishing
literary piece speckled
with symbolism, met-
aphors and East Asian
cultural allusions. Un-
fortunately, this did not
translate into an interest-
ing performance and it is a
pity that the performance
does little justice to the
potential of the script. The
pace of the story takes
too long to build up, with
little flow into the charged
climax. It is only in the
last fifteen minutes that
the point of the play gets
explained, and by then it
is already too contrived
and disjointed.
Controlling this nar-
rative, Tina Chiang (Li
Na) comes off more as
strange and eccentric than
an eerie, omniscience
figure. Feeble attempts
were made at raising the
tension, the height of it
when she steals Kevin’s
tools and seems to spike
his tea. But even then, the
tension wasn’t sustained
for any longer than a
few moments and neither
of these actions seemed
to extend the storyline
whatsoever. Mikey An-
thony-Howe (Kevin) is a
more convincing repair-
man and helped the duo
carry the story.
The eminent element of
the play is a thought-pro-
voking twist that begs for
scrutiny of missed signs
and symbols throughout
the performance. From a
broken washing machine
symbolic of an irreparable
past which can now no
longer wash away blood,
to Kevin, who becomes a
handyman and still can’t
fix his past, Tsang lays
out crumbs throughout
the story hinting at the
climax. With the final
revelation (spoiler alert!)
of Kevin being a perpe-
trator of a fatal assault,
the previously mundane
details transformed into
clues of his past and make
for a great discussion in
the tube on your way back
home.
Fix is an alluring story,
best just read.
