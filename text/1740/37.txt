living robots, your nightmare may be one step closer to reality

“[the
xenobots] are
able to survive
for days or
weeks without
any additional
nutrients”
S
tem cells have ex-
ponentially risen
in popularity for
a variety of uses,
predominantly in the field
of regenerative medicine.
Harnessed to treat dis-
eases including macular
degeneration, spinal cord
injury, diabetes, rheuma-
toid arthritis, and skin
damage, amongst others,
the incredible potential
of these cells comes from
their ability to self-renew
and differentiate into
specific cell types. While
most types of adult cells,
once damaged, cannot
regenerate, or can do so
only in fixed states and
conditions, stem cells can
give rise to many other
cell types and can promote
the repair responses of
diseased or injured tissue.
However, it now seems
that stem cells have
broader applications than
traditional regenerative
medicine. Last week, re-
searchers at the University
of Vermont and the Allen
Discovery Center of Tufts
University revealed their
use of stem cells, taken
from African clawed
frogs, to create the first
living robots. The paper,
published in the Pro-
ceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences,
names these xenobots
after the species they are
made from (Xenopus
laevis). While robots are
usually made from metal
or plastic for strength,
resistance, and durability,
these materials also carry
drawbacks, including
harmful ecological and
health-related side effects.
Lacking these same draw-
backs, living robots also
possess multiple other
benefits: in addition to
self-renewal, and healing
their own wounds, they
also disintegrate upon
completion of their
programmed task. Much
like any other natural
organism, these xenobots
will die and decay at the
end of their lifespan.
In the future, applica-
tions of these robots may
include drug delivery,
clearance of arterial
plaques, location and
digestion of toxic or
radioactive materials,
and even removal of mi-
croscopic-sized pollution
from oceans.
“These are entirely
new lifeforms. They have
never before existed on
Earth,” said Michael
Levin, the director of the
Allen Discovery Center
at Tufts University in
Medford, Massachusetts,
to the Guardian. “They
are living, programmable
organisms.”
The robots are largely
designed by an algo-
rithm, highlighting the
prevalence and utility of
computational techniques
in biology. A computer
program generates
random 3D configurations
of 500 to 1000 passive
skin cells, and active, con-
tracting heart cells, which
are then tested virtually
for properties such as their
ability to move and propel
forwards in a certain di-
rection, aggregate around
foreign objects, displace
objects, or a combination
of these.
The heart cells in this
cell mixture act like min-
iature engines, driving the
robots along for up to ten
days before death, while
the skin cells provide the
formation of an organ-
ised structure. The most
promising candidates are
then shortlisted, and used
to make more similar
designs, with the process
repeating for 100 genera-
tions, until only a selected
few remain. These tiny
robots, of <1mm, are then
finally constructed in the
lab, using skin and heart
cells from the embryos of
the African clawed frogs.
Scientists’ ability to
create novel lifeforms is
currently limited to genet-
ically modifying existing
organisms, or performing
tissue engineering in
vitro. Although syn-
thetic organoids and 3D
bioengineered scaffolds
are the most promising
endeavours, it is difficult
to predict the behav-
ioural impacts of these
arbitrary constructions.
Therefore, the creation
of these robots opens up
new avenues: while the
robots are currently very
small, the ultimate plan is
to scale them up and use
them as the first step in
designing bespoke living
organisms. Moreover, at
present, to keep the frog
cells alive, the robots need
to be placed in dishes of
water, they are then able
to survive in these con-
ditions for days or weeks
without additional nutri-
ents. By building these
xenobots out of mamma-
lian cells instead, it would
be possible for them to
survive on dry land, and
they could be built using
blood vessels, nervous
systems and sensory cells
(to form basic eyes), in-
creasing their complexity
and hence applicability.
As do all experiments
relating to stem cells,
this research raises
ethical concerns relating
to their use, but also the
fact that future variants
of the xenobots may
have nervous systems,
and thus be selected for
cognitive capability.
Questions about at which
point moral consideration
should be given to these
beings also arise – should
they be classified as living
creatures, or machines?
However, despite the
initial thought one may
have (or may have had
following the subhead-
ing…), it is unlikely that
these xenobots will pose
a threat to humankind any
time soon, as although
they demonstrate novel
functions, they are little
more than simply an
aggregates of cells, with
no capabilities of repro-
duction or evolution.
In addition to the
previously mentioned
applications, the work
also intends to utilise the
xenobots in helping sci-
entists understand human
life. “The aim is to under-
stand the software of life,”
Levin told the Guardian.
“If you think about birth
defects, cancer, age-relat-
ed diseases, all of these
things could be solved
if we knew how to make
biological structures, to
have ultimate control over
growth and form.”
And, who knows?
Maybe, despite the horror
stories of world domina-
tion, rather than destroy,
robots will save human-
kind after all.
