aking the

shared desire of most
people. Every year, we
celebrate the New Year
in the hope of taking an-
other step towards a more
peaceful world. However,
seeing #WWIII trending
all over social media
only two days after the
New Year is far from this
aspiration.

and confidence in its exceptionalism. (A reponse to this article written this week is printed on the previous page.)

“I believe that
the United
States poses
the greatest
threat to
world peace
at the present
moment”
of international law and
counts as an act of war
against Iran. This is an
asinine decision which
will only spur further
violence in the world.
There are multiple
dimensions to this event
which makes one have
second thoughts about
whether the U.S is helping
to establish peace in the
world, or is itself the
biggest threat to world
peace and liberal democ-
racy. The events of the last
few weeks suggest that it
is the latter.
In defence of the U.S.
actions, U.S secretary of
state Mike Pompeo stated
that the assassination of
General Soleimani was an
act of defence. The U.S
suspected that Soleim-
ani was plotting attacks
against U.S diplomats
and soldiers, despite the
lack of any evidence to
back such claims. Does
this mean anyone can
go around killing people
and justify it as an act
of defence against un-
foreseen future attacks?
Wouldn’t the world be
chaos if everyone justified
crime that way?
Additionally, the
majority of U.S. congress
members were kept in the
dark regarding Trump’s
decision to assassinate
General Soleimani. This
is a clear violation of
democracy for a decision
which could have global
and long-term conse-
quences, not just for
the Americans, but the
whole human population.
Democratic processes are
there to put a check on
executive power. When
they are not allowed to
act, tyranny is the result.
Thirdly, as part of the
NATO coalition in Iraq,
the British leaders were
also not informed about
the attack, an act which
has dragged the British
government into a matter
they did not consent to.
Lastly, the attack was a
violation of Iraq’s sover-
eignty, territorial integrity
and international law. It’s
like inviting your friend
to your house and he stabs
your roommate because
world peace in the present
and will continue to do so
for many years to come.
There are three main
reasons for this (a) United
States by far has the most
powerful military in the
world, (b) United States
wants to have total control
over the affairs of the
world, and (c) the crippled
democratic system in the
United States allows men
like Donald Trump to rule
the country. History has
taught us that too much
power brings forth cor-
ruption and death. When
tied with adventurism
and a failed democratic
system which puts people
like Trump in charge this
system has the potential
to be way more dangerous
to humanity than anything
else.
U.S Military Power
The U.S has by far the
most military expenditure
compared to any other
country, more than 600
each. The United States
has 11 aircraft carriers in
service, more than what
the rest of the world has
altogether, and has 72
operating nuclear-pow-
ered submarines, more
than what Russia, France,
the UK and China have
combined. The U.S also
has about 800 military
bases in 40 countries. The
UK comes second on this
list having military bases
in 13 countries only. The
U.S military also accounts
for 60 million tonnes of
carbon dioxide emission
per year. That is more
than the total carbon
dioxide produced by most
countries. If the Pentagon
was a nation, it would be
the 55th largest carbon
dioxide emitter in the
world.
U.S imperialism in the
Middle East
Let’s skip all the
adventurism by the U.S
military in Asia, Africa
he didn’t like him.
I believe that the United
States is not the saviour
of the world. Instead it
poses the greatest threat to
