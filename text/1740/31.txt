T
he main thing
to come out of
the Pokémon
Direct was a
big announcement that
Game Freak are working
on brand new DLC for
Sword and Shield. This
DLC is coming out in two
waves: The Isle ofArmour
(June) and The Crown
Tundra (November). This
is big. According to Game
Freak, this expansion
pack (selling for £26.99
for BOTH expansions) is
meant to replace the usual
incremental entry in the
franchise, e.g. Crystal,
Platinum, Ultra Sun/
Moon. Personally, I am a
huge fan of this change.
I always feel the need
to buy every Pokémon
game, so the fact that the
additional content can
now just be added to the
game rather than having
to buy a whole extra ver-
sion for some slight story
changes and extra end
game content is wonderful
news. So, what is actually
coming with this?
There will be slight
differences in either
version, depending on
whether you get this pack
for Sword or Shield (e.g.
different Pokémon). But
on the whole, whichever
game you have does not
matter much.
The Isle of Armour
Currently, we know
more about the Isle of
Armour. It takes place on
an Island to the east of
Galar, rich with beautiful
nature. The Isle ofArmour
focuses on the theme of
growth. There is a dojo
on this island, where you
begin an apprenticeship
led by the trainer who
runs the dojo ‘Mustard’.
Mustard is an ex-cham-
pion of the region, now
mentoring Leon, the
current champion of the
Galar region (until you
kick his ass at the end
of the game of course).
Whilst training in the
dojo you either train with
Klara, a poison type user,
if you have Sword – or
with Avery, a psychic type
user, if you have Shield.
They are also releasing
a brand-new legendary
Pokémon called ‘Kubfu’
– a fighting type Pokémon
that is entrusted to you
by Mustard to train until
it evolves into ‘Urshifu’
– a Pokémon with two
distinct forms. Urshifu is
“We are being
given over
200 Pokémon
that have been
left out of the
game this time
round”
“The Crown
Tundra has
a new form
of co-op play
which allows
you to journey
with friends”
a powerful Pokémon that
is also getting a Gigan-
tamax version for both
forms: single strike (fight-
ing-dark) and rapid strike
(fighting-water). As well
as this additional story
content, we are being
given over 200 more
Pokémon that have been
left out of the game this
time round. You do not
even need to buy the ex-
pansion pass to add them
to your team – as long as
you get Pokémon Home
when it comes out later
this year, you’ll be able to
trade these monsters from
your old games to the new
ones.
The starters are all
getting Gigantamax forms
as well! My personal
favourite is Rillaboom’s,
which transforms it from
looking like a toned-
down Donkey Kong into
a full-on heavy metal
drummer. As well as this
there are new fashion
items, new looks for
the Rotom bike, an exp.
Charm, apricorns that can
be turned into pokéballs
and more tutor moves!
The Crown Tundra
The Crown Tundra is
themed around the idea of
exploration, taking place
in a frozen wildland to the
North of Galar. Like the
Isle of Armour, you’ll be
able to find Pokémon that
were not present in the
game at launch. Fitting in
with the theme, there is
plenty to discover, from
mysterious temples to a
giant tree growing in a
place where it doesn’t
belong.
A ‘certain person’
appoints you as the leader
of their exploration team
in the Crown Tundra.
Calyrex is the legendary
Pokémon of this expan-
sion. This psychic and
grass type is characterised
by its graceful, regal
movements.
The Crown Tundra
has a new form of co-op
play which allows you
to journey with friends
into Pokémon dens deep
underground, beneath the
frozen tundra. Deep inside
the dens you will be able to
find all kinds of legendary
Pokémon, including some
brand-new ones waiting
to be found. Similar to the
Isle of Armour, there will
be new clothing items to
purchase too!
Once you have com-
pleted the entire game,
the Isle of Armour and
the Crown Tundra, there
should be plenty more
battle challenges waiting
for you.
Controversy
Personally, I am super
excited for this! With 2
new areas meant to be
bigger than the original
wild area, and a bunch of
new legendaries, what’s
not to like? Well for most
people, the price. The
majority of concern that
I am seeing online seems
to come from the idea that
Game Freak could have
just included this all in the
base game – especially the
returning Pokémon. I see
where people are coming
from with this; increasing
the development cycle
for this game in order to
fit this all in could have
worked.
However, Sword
and Shield are already
massive, and in order to
take the extra time for de-
velopment it would have
meant delaying the game
past the holidays. This
would have resulted in: a)
no big title for Nintendo
during the holidays, b)
worse sales of the Switch
Lite which released a
couple of months prior and
c) a likely upset fan base
who have been waiting
for a mainline Pokémon
title on the switch since
its release 3 years ago! I
am of the opinion that this
is a good thing. It means
that we got Sword and
Shield during the usual
November Pokémon
release, and now we can
look forward to more
content throughout the
year without having to
buy another incremental
game. There’s nothing I
dislike more than buying
a new Pokémon game
and playing through the
same story again for hours
just to experience a small
amount of post-game
content. I’m looking at
you Ultra Sun and Ultra
Moon.
