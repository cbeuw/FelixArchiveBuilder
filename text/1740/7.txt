I
t is likely that many
of the readers have
heard of escalating
tensions between the
US and Iran, especially
after the assassination of
Qassem Soleimani.While
many were taken by
surprise after this move
from the US, it is crucial
to understand that in fact
this event, as rogue as it
was, is a result of a steady
deterioration between the
US and Iran’s relations.
After 2015 there was
a sense of hope and
optimism that the decades
of tension between Iran
and the US were perhaps
on the wane, following
the nuclear deal between
Obama and Rouhani. This
deal essentially outlined
that in exchange for Iran
limiting their nuclear
activities and allowing
international inspectors
into their nuclear facili-
ties, the US would lift its
economic sanctions that
crippled Iran’s economy.
This deal was success-
ful and aided the mending
of the two countries’
estranged diplomatic rela-
tions. However, following
Donald Trump’s entry
into the White House,
diplomatic relations were
soon to suffer. Trump
had stated as part of his
campaign that he wanted
to abandon the nuclear
deal, otherwise formally
known as the Joint Com-
prehensive Plan of Action
(JCPOA), one that had
been negotiated by the
United States, the United
Kingdom, Russia, France,
China and Germany and
Iran. This move was
highly discouraged by key
international players such
as France and China, that
advised against the move,
given that the evidence
was clear that Iran had in
fact been adhering to the
deal. The International
Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) and Mike Pompeo
verified this, with the
only claims against this
coming from Benjamin
Netanyahu. He argued that
Iran had broken the deal
given that they had not
disclosed their research
into nuclear weapons, and
based on alleged evidence
that Israel had obtained,
Iran had been carrying
out research into nuclear
weapons and had not
disclosed it.
The IAEA responded
that there is no evidence
that Iran tried to develop
nuclear weapons after
2009 and other EU coun-
tries spoke out saying that
they were not naïve about
Iran’s nuclear intentions,
but that regardless, the
terms of the JCPOA had
not been broken by Iran.
Interestingly enough,
there is a very clear irony
in Israel’s sudden aversion
of nuclear warheads in the
Middle East, when they
themselves are widely
known to possess nuclear
warheads, and they have
very purposely remained
ambiguous when it comes
to their international
statements about the
issue, never officially
denying or admitting to
having the weapons, yet
calling out Iran when not
disclosing information
about their research on
nuclear weapons, despite
them being guilty of the
exact same accusation.
It is estimated that they
have anywhere between
80 and 400 warheads,
and they also declined
to sign the Treaty on
the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons, despite
the UN’s urges to join it.
After all the accusa-
tions and Netanyahu’s
theatrical speech and
newfound rejection of
nuclear weapons, Trump
abandoned the nuclear
deal in May 2018 and
reinstated the economic
sanctions against Iran.
He also threatened do
the same to countries and
companies that continue
to buy goods from Iran.
This move meant that
Iran was forced into a
diplomatic issue with the
US, as neither does Trump
wish to abide by the
nuclear deal that the US
initially organised, neither
does he acknowledge the
international sources that
back that Iran had in fact
been complying with the
deal, and also forces every
other country that has
economic ties with Iran to
actively choose between
maintaining these rela-
tions with Iran and thus
becoming target of the
US’ sanctions, or cutting
off ties with an economic
partner.
Iran then issued a
statement calling Trump
“unacceptable” and
decided to bypass the US
and continue negotiations
of the deal with the
remaining signatories:
France, Germany, UK,
Russia and China. The
US announces the rolling
out of their sanctions soon
after and Iran as a result
states that they will no
longer keep the enriched
uranium and produced
heavy water limited, and
that the signatories of the
deal have 60 days to fulfil
their part of the JCPOA.
Iran then issues another
warning statement 10
days before surpassing
the limit, saying that this
can be reversed if the
European signatories
step in to stop the US
sanctions and abide by
their part of the deal. This
never happens and more
events in the Gulf ensue
where Iran and the US
clash. Amongst these are
the US sanctions to Iran’s
foreign minister Javad
Zarif, the shooting down
of a US drone by Iran,
the US’ deployment of
F-22 stealth fighters, and
the US’ attempts to keep
the Grace 1, an Iranian
tanker, under detention
in Gibraltar, despite
Gibraltar’s supreme court
ruling that the vessel is
free to sail, also offering
several millions to the
captain of the vessel if
he agreed to steer it into
a country where it could
be seized. These are just
a few of the events that
occurred as an aftermath,
but the most recent and
notable ones were the US’
assassination of Qassem
Soleimani, and Iran’s
firing of missiles against
the Ukrainian passenger
airplane, that had been
mistaken by a US cruise
air missile according to
the Iranian government.
There seems to be a
clear trend towards the
scaling of aggression and
the deterioration of nego-
tiation talks between the
US and Iran since Trump
became president, with
many moves on the US’
side showing an unneces-
sary provocative attitude
towards Iran despite
Iran’s initial willingness
to renegotiate the nuclear
deal and continue to abide
by it. Trump created a
problem between Iran and
the US when there was
none to start with, to show
a “strong” response and
the timing of this is very
coincidental with his im-
peachment scandal and the
end of his term looming
with the 2020 elections,
which unsurprisingly
enough, is a similar situa-
tion in which his only in-
ternational supporter was,
Netanyahu, with serious
corruption charges, and
at the time, an upcoming
election. It is especially
worrying how the US
government believes it is
entitled enough to kill a
government general, and
then proceed to justify
this assassination, and it
is also not only worrying
but tragic how the lives of
civilians were the cost to
pay for the Iranian gov-
ernment’s mistake.
Ultimately, as readers,
it is crucial that we
understand the context
of the political news that
are reported in the media,
and avoid falling victim
to propaganda and ma-
nipulation., as it is sadly
becoming a trend to see
media outlets suddenly
vilify collectives to suit
the agenda of certain
political parties, and then
conveniently omit the so
necessary context that
provides a better under-
standing of the causes and
the consequences of the
reported events.
