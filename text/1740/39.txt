green sticker to set them-
selves apart but don’t get it
twisted. Inside there is still
the same The ‘Hot Chic’
Chicken Burger becomes
vegan by the swap to the
This Isn’t Fried Chicken
Patty. On first taste, there
isn’t a difference. The
texture of the burger was
perfect, the outer coating
a perfect substitute for
the buttermilk. The faux
chicken stood its ground,
coming apart naturally
and staying moist. If I
wasn’t the one ordering,
I wouldn’t have known it
wasn’t real chicken.
The “Ari Gold” vegan
burger doesn’t come
close to the Patty & Bun
classic that it attempts to
imitate. The plant-based
patty, which is the same
one that all the other
Vegan version come with
expect the ‘Hot Chic’ and
The Whoopi Goldburger,
left me lacking when the
memory of the juicier,
thicker meat version was
still fresh in my mind. All
the other parts of it were
still and bright and tasty as
ever but the vegan cheese
let me down. It didn’t melt
properly and ended up
tasting slimy.
If “Hot Chic” is
Mystique then the vegan
chicken nuggets are Loki
because these were also
indiscernible from their
animal counterpart. It
comes with vegan mayo
and if you haven’t been
able to tell already Patty
& Bun never does just
mayo. The vegan variety
was given a new lease of
life with the addition of
their blend of spices. We
also sampled the vegan
Biscoff milkshake and it
was a creamy and sweet.
Another great imitation.
To the vegans of
Imperial, I’m sure you are
tired of the exploitation of
veganism for progressive,
woke points by companies
that hop on the trend every
January without nuanced,
structural changes to
make their menus accessi-
ble to a meat-less diet. Or
whatever my vegan friend
said when I used milk in
my tea. Well, I can tell you
that Patty & Bun is not
one of these companies.
You don’t have to rush to
try some good vegan food
before the month is over
because this is becoming
the vegan versions are
staying on the menu full
time.
Their branches are
rather small so during
peak times, it can be
difficult to get yourself a
space. The staff all seem
to have a chill vibe around
them which fits the brand
perfectly. The sounds of
Lo-fi and RnB wafting
through the restaurant and
the low lighting gives the
ambiance an intimate feel.
Patty & Bun still has
more up its sleeve from
reopenings to giveaways
and to new location
specific deals. They have
their monthly deals lined
up for some great things
this year so be sure to be
on the lookout.

This month, they’ve
gone Veganuary themed
for the special. But this
time they are not only
coming with a new burger
but also with fully devel-
oped vegan menu which
is part of the student deal.
Veganuary becomes a
lot easier when all their
burgers now also come
in a meat-free form. But
how does it compare to
the originals? Because we
tirelessly work for you
guys to make sure you
have the tea, we tried two
of their burgers, sampling
both of their new vegan
patties. They come with
the same packaging with a
dream, and this isn’t even their final form
