Fourth Union Council of 2019-20: Rundown

Liberation and Com-
munity Reform
T
he first paper up
for discussion
was submitted
by the Deputy
President (Welfare),
Shervin Sabeghi, regard-
ing his ongoing work to
review and reform the
structure of the Liberation
and Community officers’
roles within the Union.
Specifically, the paper
proposes the introduc-
tion of Liberation and
Community Student
Networks, with multiple
officers representing the
interests of each group.
This would, in theory,
enable more support to
be given to students, as
currently the structure
of the Liberation and
Community support falls
squarely on the shoulders
of individual officers.
Concerns were raised
about filling all of the po-
sitions in Spring elections,
which was rebutted with
how many students tend
to run for unfilled roles in
Autumn elections.
Working Class Oﬃcer
As part of the same
paper, it was noted that
a statistically significant
attainment gap exists
between students of
different socioeconomic
classes, as well as these
students facing specific
problems unique to them.
Given the intention of the
College to increase the
number of students from
‘disadvantaged socioeco-
nomic backgrounds’, one
of the subcommittees of
Council (the Community
and Welfare Board, or
CWB) felt it appropriate
to establish a new Lib-
eration and Community
Officer: a Working Class
Officer.
A few queries were
raised regarding the name,
and a few other sugges-
tions, such as ‘Access
Officer’, were discussed.
The Council passed
the paper with a vote of
32 to 1, with one member
abstaining.
Rent
The Union Council
voted 29 to 3, with two
abstentions, to reject the
College’s financial model
for halls rent again.

for a breakdown.
Update to Standing
Orders:
ERB Voting Member-
ship Excludes Dep
Reps
The Council Chair
updates the Union’s
Standing Orders every
year; this was discussed
further in the first Council
Rundown in October
2019. Where disputes
were raised, adjustments
were made.
One such adjustment
caused controversy in
the January 21st meeting
– specifically, the voting
membership of the Edu-
cation and Representation
Board (ERB) had been
reduced to just nine, by
removing voting power
from departmental repre-
sentatives.
The reasoning behind
this was a further change
this year: that subcom-
mittees of Council have
the ability to vote on and
pass policies, so long as
the remit of the policy
falls only under their
own. Therefore, although
boards such as the CWB
and ERB have almost
never needed to vote in
the past, they will need
to regularly now. Many
departmental reps – par-
ticularly postgraduate
reps – do not attend most
meetings of these Boards,
meaning that they would
struggle to reach quorum,
the minimum proportion
of voters needed for a vote
to be valid.
Several Council
members strongly
opposed this change,
citing the fact that the
ERB itself had discussed
the issue and agreed they
preferred to keep depart-
mental reps’ votes earlier
this year. Alternate solu-
tions were offered, such
as adopting the Council’s
rule that missing two
meetings excludes you
from voting.
The vote was indeci-
sive, 10 members voting
to accept the change, 17
rejecting it, and 7 abstain-
ing; the vote will run again
at the next meeting.
Reports
Most of the reports
– from the constituent
unions and sabbatical
officers – were relaying
the content of their papers,
which are available on the
Union website.
