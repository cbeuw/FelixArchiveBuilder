n these rapid-
ly-changing times
of Imperial College
Union, big strides are
being made, such as the
negotiations with College
of halls rent and the in-
troduction of the support
networks for Liberation
and Community Officers
to expand their impact.
New changes are being
brought about by the
Officer Trustees to try
out new things and see
how they can have their
impact, but as I, and many
of the senior volunteers,
have seen, some of these
developments go awry.
We all witnessed the
rainy Tuesday in October
that saw all efforts made
towards creating a wel-
coming freshers fair liter-
ally wash away. Although
the weather was partly to
blame here, it did not come
without ample warning
giving the Union time to
react, plan and reach out
to CSPs. Although the
Union admitted defeat
in this case, and did
aim to make it up to the
CSPs, was the attempt at
the Welcome Back Fair
enough to make up for
the catastrophic effect of
their prior actions?
At Union Council this
week, I was pleasantly
surprisedatTom’s(DPCS)
recent acknowledgement
of the fact that student-led
initiatives have been more
successful than if they
were done by the Union.
Although speaking here
regarding the matter of
ACC andArts nights at the
union, Tom has also men-
tioned this in the context
of student involvement
regarding updating Union
systems. This would be
a major step forward in
ensuring that students
are at the heart of the
Union’s decisions that
effect student volunteers.
An example of which I
have personally witnessed
regarding sponsorship
contracts.
Many of you are likely
aware that concerns
have been raised over
the way that sponsorship
contracts are signed by
the DPFS. The current
system involves the
DPFS checking through
the multiple pages of
the contracts are legally
binding documents. And
even after the contracts
have been signed, there’s
another week to get the
invoice for your sponsor
as the Finance team has to
approve it once again.
As you can see this
isn’t the most efficient
path for a document to be
processed as it essentially
has to go through the
union twice. It also seems
like a mismanagement
of the DPFS’s valuable
time, taking away from
their other, arguably more
important responsibilities,
such as returning food
to the Union! Moreover,
having gone through this
13 times myself, I can
say from experience that
the sponsorship process is
incredibly laborious and
time consuming for CSPs
and often sponsors grow
impatient. (Just imagine
what DoCSoc go through,
doing this over 50 times!)
With growing concerns
raised by multiple CSPs,
particularly DepSocs,
Hilliam (CGCU Treas-
urer) and I took it upon
ourselves to do something
about it. After sitting
down for less than 5
minutes, we already had a
pretty decent idea of how
to implement a “Sponsor-
ship Contract builder” on
eActivities.
Our proposition would
allow CSPs to input
their variables, such as
sponsor name, fee and
services provided and
then receive a finished,
signed, contract. From
here the contract can be
signed by the CSP and
sponsor then uploaded to
have an invoice generat-
ed, like how POs work.
This system would also
allow for management
group checks, reducing
the number of contracts
reaching the DPFS that
have errors. All in all we
created this to save our-
selves and also the DPFS
a lot of time!
Whilst we were ex-
tremely grateful that the
Officer Trustees have been
incredibly on board with
our idea, we are struggling
to see the vision of im-
plementation of the idea.
Hilliam and I were soon
told the matter was being
taken care of and haven’t
been consulted since. This
is only just one case, but
as it is student volunteers
like ourselves who we are
thinking about the most, it
makes us lose confidence
when the Union decides
to handle actions by itself
and we have to entrust that
these ideas aren’t poorly
executed. As student vol-
unteers we have recently
been promised many
things. This includes ex-
perienced student volun-
teers delivering sessions
at officer academy and a
system that would allow
students to directly con-
tribute to improvements
of the Union’s systems.
Although these ideas
sound like a step forward
in improving the Union’s
relationship with its
student volunteers, after
recent miscommunica-
tions and false promises,
we are yet to see if they
will be successful or if
the Union will continue to
dangle the carrot in front
of us.

I
n just under a month,
150RoyalMinerswill
be heading down to
Cornwall to continue
a much-loved RSMU tra-
dition, older than Imperial
College itself. This is, of
course, the Bottle Match,
which brings the fierce
rivalry between the Royal
School of Mines and the
University of Exeter’s
Camborne School of
Mines to a weekend
of sporting events and
revelry.
The 118th annual
Bottle Match will take
place between the 21st
and 23rd February and is
sure to be a highlight of
the year for many of our
members. Bottle Match
is the world’s second
longest running rugby
varsity but has expanded
in scope since its humble
beginnings in 1902.
This year, eight teams
compete in seven sports;
Tennis, Squash, Hockey
(Men’s and Women’s),
Netball, Lacrosse,
Football and Rugby. Each
match is intense, with
players giving it their all
and spectators cheering
and chanting on the side
lines. It really is worth the
hype; but be sure to bring
lots of warm clothes (like
our RSM Bobble Hats and
Scarves) to keep warm.
Each team will compete
for an individual prize
(either an actual trophy, or
just bragging rights), with
the rugby team competing
for the titular Bottle, a
3-foot-tall tin beer bottle
that was ‘liberated’ from a
delivery lorry by a group
of students in 1926. Since
then, it has undergone
various transformations,
first being emblazoned
with the emblems of
the RSM and the CSM,
then being damaged and
welded repeatedly (it
could do with a fix-up
now, so if any of our
friends over at the CGCU
know how to weld, your
help would be appreciat-
ed!)
Finally, as is tradition,
every year we design a
new Bottle Match t-shirt.
If you have any creative
designsorideas,sendthem
over to me at rsmpres@
ic.ac.uk or Annie Mao,
the RSMU Vice President
(Clubs and Societies) at
rsm-vpcs@ic.ac.uk; you
might even get a discount
on your ticket! Tickets
include return travel from
the RSM to Cornwall, 2
nights’ accommodation,
entry into the celebration
at the FXU, a seat at
Players Dinner (players
only) and travel to Sailors,
for the after-party.
So, if you’re on the
fence about coming – I
really would recommend
it! Bottle Match is always
a great experience for
players and spectators
alike and is a great way
to get involved with the
RSMU.
Bottle Match 2020
tickets will be available
for players and specta-
tors to purchase from
12pm-2pm on Friday 24th
February in RSM G35, for
£65

every single contract,
that’s 307 contracts so
far but hopefully 308 if
my latest contract gets
read! Despite many of
the clauses of contracts
not varying between
clubs or sponsors, the
DPFS still has to check
these to ensure no errors
have been made since
