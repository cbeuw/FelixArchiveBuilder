The Starless Sea by Erin Morgenstern
BOOKS

Books Writer
I
know a good book
when I read it because
it has managed to
leave me inspired, or
thoughtful, or feeling any
kind of strong emotion
towards it – and that’s…
fine. I will give it a three
to four-star rating, maybe
recommend it to a friend
that would find it interest-
ing and call it a day. I know
a great book when I read
it when it has managed to
leave me utterly, deeply
and completely disorient-
ed. I finished reading The
Starless Sea less than one
week before my first exam
and for a whole day I
forgot to be stressed about
it. Morgenstern’s writing,
accompanied with the
vivid and very twilight
zone-y scenery she
created with it, feels like
a fever dream you know
is absurd in its essence as
you experience it, but also
is alarmingly vivid.
The Starless Sea
follows Zachary, a 25-
year-old grad student.
He loves to read books
he borrows from the uni-
versity library (which are
unrealistically non-sci-
entific), where one day
he finds an old, battered
book with no informa-
tion about the author on
the cover, titled “Sweet
Sorrows”, which doesn’t
seem to be registered in
the library. He decides to
borrow it anyway – but
he is shocked to find out
that, amongst the many,
seemingly unrelated short
stories, there is one de-
scribing a day of his child-
hood in great detail. It’s a
story of the boy he used
to be, standing in front of
a mysterious door which
he ultimately decided
not to open – a door, the
story says, that would
lead him to a place called
the starless sea. Unable
to ignore this, he sets out
to find more information
about this book, and the
mysterious underground
library some of the stories
describe, getting himself
involved in something a
lot bigger and older than
himself in ways he cannot
yet imagine.
The Starless Sea is
Erin Morgenstern’s
second work – her first
one, The Night Circus,
was very well received.
I have bought but not yet
read The Night Circus to
compare but judging by
how much I enjoyed The
Starless Sea, I think that
the hype around it was
well-earned. It checks a
lot of the boxes that make
a good book – and if not
good, then at least worth
reading. First of all, the
story in itself and the way
it was told, struck me
from the very beginning
as incredibly unique. Each
chapter of the main story
unravelling in the present
is interrupted by what, in
the beginning, seems to
be fragments of little alle-
“What seems
irrelevant at
first becomes
important part
of the plot
as the story
unfolds”
goric pieces of fairytales –
about people and the lives
they have lived, time and
fate and their tragic tale
of love, and a mysterious
owl king. These seem
very irrelevant at first, but
as the story unfolds, they
become a very important
part of the plot – become
more than words on a
page, or an insert that is
there just to set an aesthet-
ically pleasing scene.
For a book as lengthy
as this one is, the people
who are introduced
within its pages are sur-
prisingly few. The total
number of people adds
up to no more than 10.
All of them were very
multi-dimensional and
interesting – as everything
in this book was; every
part they played in the
story was very carefully
planned – none of them
written as a plot filler or
an easy way to earn diver-
sity brownie points. What
is more, Morgenstern
managed to achieve the
impossible – creating the
mysterious love interest, a
troubled guy with a dark
past-type character while
also making him interest-
ing, in a way that doesn’t
feel too try-hard, edgy or
overdone. I was more than
impressed.
The Starless Sea, as
most (if not all) pieces
of storytelling art created
amount to today, can be
broken down in to tropes.
However, to say that it
boils down to the typical
otherwise not special
protagonist-saves-the-day
cliché plot would be
beyond unfair. It is in no
way a story about, or of
Zachary – it is a story
(one of the many) about
the starless sea, which,
as all stories do, has a
beginning, a middle and
an end – a story the reader
is made aware that they’re
experiencing only a part
of.
This brings me to my
next point. Now, I am
often very critical of open
endings. It always felt
a bit lazy to me to write
hundreds upon hundreds
of pages just to end the
book on a very bleak and
vague “and they might’ve
survived, but nothing
knows what happened
to them after that, the
end.” tone. However, the
exact fact that throughout
it the reader is made to
understand that they’re
reading about a piece of
a story that is connected
with countless others that
have already been written,
and ones that have not
yet come to exist, makes
it feel wrong to say that
The Starless Sea had “an
open ending”. All the
little details that are left
unexplained don’t seem to
matter entirely that much
– they’re part of things
that have always been or
that haven’t yet begun to
unfold.
In conclusion, there is
no way to coherently talk
about all the points and
the elaborate plots that
intertwine and make up
the experience that is The
Starless Sea. Reading this
book felt like a puzzle,
whose fragments individ-
ually mean very little and
could only be understood
for what they were when
their neighboring frag-
ments had also been put
together. The story does
not have a “big reveal”
that makes everything
make sense all at once,
but throughout it there are
points when it just clicks,
odd-shaped pieces of
story perfectly sorted into
place, absolutely nothing
left to chance. Amazing
in its conception, its
characters and its writing,
I would recommend The
Starless Sea to anyone.
