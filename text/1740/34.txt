The Future Looks Bright for Japanese Equities
faced a protracted period
of economic stagnation,
with the Nikkei index still
yet to reach and surpass
its meteoric highs of the
early 90s. Moreover,
demographic changes and
an ageing population are
of big concern for policy
makers in the country.
For a long time, fore-
casts and predictions for
the economic health of the
country had been bleak.
However, some changes
are starting to manifest
themselves now which are
beginning to transform
the Japanese economy
and, coupled with the suc-
cesses of the Rugby and
Olympic competitions, it
seems that positive times
are ahead for the country.
To the Olympics and
beyond
During the Olympics,
an expected 8.4 million
people will visit Tokyo
with many more watching
on from around the world.
The Japanese government
have made it very clear
that they want to use this
unparalleled exposure
to advertise the culture,
opportunities for invest-
ment, and technological
advances that Japan has
to offer, or “monozukuri”
– excellence in manufac-
turing.
Some important
debates will take place
in Japan next year, most
notably the holding of a
long anticipated referen-
dum on the role of Japan’s
military and, increasingly,
those leading the country
are discussing what role
Japan will play in the
international community
in the future. On the
surface, demographic
change and an ageing
population seem to be the
biggest challenges that the
country faces. And whilst
this is true to an extent,
there are some other
key things which will
challenge the resilience of
Japan’s economy as well
as force a reassessment
of the role the country
plays in the international
order. Underpinning this
is a need to cement the
economic growth the
country has seen in the
past few years and ensure
its future prosperity by in-
culcating greater changes
to the social and economic
attitudes of its people and
businesses.
Abenomics
Prime Minister Abe’s
economic policy, which
is commonly referred to
as “Abenomics”, has a
three-pronged approach.
In order to stimulate an
economy that was defla-
tionary for many years,
Shinzō Abe has focused
on increasing the nation’s
FELIX
money supply, fiscal
stimulus, and structural
reform to make Japan’s
economy more compet-
itive on a global stage.
When Abe become Prime
Minister for the second
time in 2012 he declared
that he would “implement
bold monetary policy,
flexible fiscal policy and
a growth strategy that
encourages private invest-
ment, and with these three
pillars, achieve results.”
To a large extent these
policies have been suc-
cessful, providing a steady
rate of inflation, pushing
down unemployment to a
22-year low of 2.4%, and
helping make Japanese
businesses more com-
petitive. However, in the
long-term this economic
stimulus will be chal-
lenged as demographic
change in Japan becomes
more acute. The working
population in Japan is
predicted to fall from
76 million in 2018 to 54
million in 2050, whilst the
proportion of those aged
over 65 is set to increase
from 28% in 2018 to 38%
in 2050.
Ageing Japan
The advantage of these
sorts of demographic
changes is that they
have forced the Japanese
government and policy
makers to confront some
of the underlying issues
that have held back the
country’s economy for
a long time despite the
advances made underAbe.
Increasing participation in
the workforce of women
and foreign workers over
the last few years has
had a positive impact and
this looks set to increase
further and further in the
future.
Whilst the increase
in foreign workers and
a greater proportion of
women working will
have cultural ramifica-
tions in Japan, it should
help support the ageing
workforce. According to
Graham Smith, a market
commentator at Fidelity,
this opening of the doors
to foreign blue-collar
workers could be a “game
changer” for the Japanese
economy.
The Japanese Market
Diving deeper, the
make-up of Japan’s stock
market is also changing.
Typically viewed as
very expensive, value
investors have been put
off the Japanese equities
market due to compara-
bly high P/E ratios and
dividend yields, but this is
changing.
These sorts of metrics
are now much more
in-line with the US stock
market, which makes it
I
n the latter part of
2019, Japan finished
hosting the Rugby
World Cup. I’m sure
those who watched any
of it would agree that it
was a verifiable success,
and for nearly two months
the country was at the
centre of the sporting
world. After the success
of this rugby competition,
Japan now looks towards
the Olympics this year
for another chance to
shine. These kinds of
competitions can become
cultural phenomena; those
in London during 2012
will remember the eupho-
ria in the UK but also the
“The Japanese
market’s
dividend yield

stands at

a more attractive place
for those once turned-off
value investors. Since the
crash of the late 1980s,
the Nikkei 225 index is
still about 1/3 lower than
its peak three decades ago
and if Abe’s reforms can
continue to strengthen
economic growth in
Japan, these sorts of value
investments become in-
creasingly attractive.
One of the problems
with cheap stocks is that
there often needs to be
a catalyst that pushes
their price up to their
intrinsic market value.
But with structural

way in which it captured
the imaginations of many
around the world.
I have no doubt that
the 2020 Tokyo Olympics
will be just as successful
and will introduce many
around the world to the
wonderful hospitality
and culture of Japan. For
these reasons, and for
many others, I think it
is a particularly vibrant
and exciting time for
Japan both culturally but
also economically. Ever
since the tech boom and
bust of the late 80s and
early 90s, the country has
