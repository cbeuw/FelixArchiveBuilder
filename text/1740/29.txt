His Dark Materials: Paradise Regained (Finally)
A new attempt at televising Philip Pullman’s epic trilogy finally seems to get it right
H
is Dark
M a t e r i a l s
(HDM) is a
new series
broadcast by both the BBC
and HBO. It is a fresh
take on Philip Pullman’s
original eponymous
trilogy. Following the
disappointing reception of
the original television ad-
aptation of The Northern
Lights (the first book
in the trilogy) as the
feature film The Golden
Compass, we unfortunate-
ly had to wait until the
television and film rights
expired before being able
to experience any more of
the story on screen. Now
that the wait is finally
over, and the first season
of His Dark Materials has
been released, it does not
disappoint.
The first season has a
much darker tone and a
more modern and realistic
feel than The Golden
Compass which is much
truer to the nature of
the books. The Golden
Compass tended to tone
down the content to
make things relatively
child friendly, losing the
essence of the original
trilogy in the process.
Pullman’s belief is that
fiction whose readership
includes children (there
is no such thing as “chil-
dren’s fiction”, since any
children’s book will also
be read by adults, says he),
should be able to deal with
any issues that children
might realistically expe-
rience in their everyday
lives. This includes
traditionally taboo themes
such as divorce and sexual
maturity, which of course
are things that children
may come across in some
form in their daily lives,
but may not fully com-
prehend. In keeping with
his philosophy, his trilogy
includes ideas about
things such as puberty,
religious indoctrination
and oppression. Definite-
ly not what you might
immediately associate
with children’s literature.
These, notably, are also
the things which The
Golden Compass seemed
to filter out, which made it
flop despite its stellar cast,
which included Nicole
Kidman and Daniel Craig.
It is unclear whether
the decision was made to
embolden the storytelling
because of a return to
Pullman’s original ideals,
or whether it is simply
reflective of the fact that
those who were children
at the time of The Golden
Compass’s release, or who
read the original trilogy at
the time, are now adults.
Perhaps by not limiting
the run time to the length
of a feature film, the team
had more time to experi-
ment with developing and
adding depth to the story.
In any case, it was a step
in the right direction.
The season is well
put together in terms of
storytelling, pace, and its
overall tone. The head-
quarters of the Magisteri-
um (a vaguely disguised
representation of the
Catholic Church) are in
a clean cut, minimalist
building, in stark contrast
to the magical spires of
the Oxford colleges that
the protagonist, Lyra,
calls home. Despite the
fact that technological
advancements such as
modern touch screen
smartphones and tablet
computers were not used
at the time that Pullman
wrote the original trilogy,
different forms of such
technology make frequent
appearances throughout
the first season, further
emphasising that this is a
show of our times. These
modern touches by the
creative team are a testa-
ment to their awareness of
the modern audience.
An interesting dis-
tinction from the books
was the inclusion of
parts of The Subtle Knife
(the second book in the
trilogy), interleaved
throughout scenes from
The Northern Lights.
Writer Jack Thorne
(Skins, Shameless, Harry
Potter and the Cursed
Child) has mentioned that
the production team had
the benefit of hindsight,
with all 3 parts of the
trilogy to work with from
the get-go, meaning that
they could throw away
the need for chronological
storytelling and introduce
elements of the second
book much earlier. on
This enables them to
foreshadow future events
in a different way to the
novels, drawing inter-
esting parallels between
plotlines, and I think it
works very well.
Of course, the first
season isn’t perfect by any
means. I felt the pacing for
the first few episodes was
rather slow, presumably
to set the scene and avoid
bombarding the audience
with details that could
be revealed over time, as
required. However, this
does change as the story
progresses.
It might be my prej-
udice, already being
familiar with the HDM
universe, but I felt that the
audience were sometimes
patronised a bit too much.
Certain expositions about
plot points or the quirks
of Lyra’s world, done
mostly through char-
acter dialogue, seemed
unnecessary and could
have been better executed
through simply showing
us, rather than telling.
One thing that was done
well was the diversity in
casting, with black actors
and actresses in roles
across the board. This
notably includes Ariyon
Bakare who gives an out-
standing performance as
Lord Boreal, and Clarke
Peters as the master of
Jordan College. This
could of course be taken
further through the inclu-
sion of people from a more
diverse variety of ethnic
backgrounds. The world
is not just black and white
- it is grey too, something
perfectly exemplified by
one of the most interesting
characters in the His Dark
Materials trilogy: Mrs
Coulter, whose morality is
very grey indeed.
Ruth Wilson’s perfor-
mance as Marisa Coulter
is, in a word, brilliant. It is
as true to the books as you
could wish for. Her scenes
with Lyra (Daphne Keen)
exquisitely exhibit the
inner conflict of a woman
doing the wrong things
for perhaps not-so-wrong
reasons. Jack Thorne’s
goal of avoiding making
her one-dimensional
really does come across.
James McAvoy was
drafted in as Lord Asriel
as an emergency re-
placement late on in the
process. His performance
is accurate though perhaps
slightly theatrical, in the
literal sense: in certain
scenes I felt as though
I was watching a play
rather than a TV show.
Despite his at times over-
the-top performance, he
effectively portrays Lord
Asriel as a dynamic and
preoccupied man, prone
to fits of aggression, but
with a strong purpose.
Finally, I would like
to mention the central
character: Lyra herself,
played by Daphne Keen.
It is immediately obvious
that Lyra’s character in the
TV show is not the same
as the one in the books,
but that is not to say that
that it is an entirely bad
thing. Pullman has gone
so far as to describe the
literary Lyra as a “greedy
little savage”, on account
of her mischievousness
and propensity for telling
lies, but the Lyra in the
show is a very different
girl. Although still men-
dacious, she appears to
be much more innocent.
She perhaps comes across
as a little too docile. In
the show’s defence, this
can be reconciled with
the overarching theme
of the original trilogy
(again, one that Pullman
may have only become
aware of while writing the
stories in retrospect), of
the transition from inno-
cence to wisdom.
Overall, this series is
definitely worth a watch!
It should be exciting for
those who, as of yet,
have no experience of the
world of daemons and
panserbjørne, and also
offers seasoned readers a
fresh enough take on the
original… materials… to
keep them interested.
Now… stop standing
at the brink of hell,
pondering your voyage,
and go and find His Dark
Materials on iPlayer!
