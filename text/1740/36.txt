The Omen of the Next Recession
a large corporation which
is conventionally thought
of as one of the safest
investments: the govern-
ment, if short on cash, can
simply increase taxation.
Maturity is the length of
time it will take for repay-
ment to occur or the bond
to ‘mature’. In a sense
therefore, leaving your
money locked away for
longer i.e. higher maturity
is a greater risk to you as
an investor because there
is a far greater uncertainty
over a 10-year period as
opposed to a two-year
period say. Hence, inves-
tors traditionally expect
higher rates on longer
term bonds to compensate
for the increased risk
meaning the yield on
higher maturity bonds
tends to be greater which
you will see below for the
healthy years of 2011 and
2018.
On the other hand,
when investors fear a
gloomy outlook, they tend
to position themselves
with longer term safe
assets such as government
bonds rather than say the
stock market reﬂecting
a short-term pessimism.
When the demand for such
bonds is high enough, the
yield on long term bonds
will decrease below that
of short-term bonds which
is what is known as an
inversion seen Figure 2
for the years 2000 and
2007 where the gradient
decreases below zero.
Additionally, on Figure 1.
displaying the difference
between yields on 10-year
versus three-month bonds
you will see that it goes
negative prior to each
recession signifying that
at those points, returns on
10-year bonds are lower
than those of 3-month
bonds.
However, few econo-
mists believe this sort of
speculation itself guar-
antees a slowdown but
FELIX
rather that a slowdown is
caused by a culmination
of central banks raising
rates in the short term to
keep the economy from
overheating and investors
fearing slower growth so
moving to longer term
positions.
The Federal Reserve
of the United States as
with any central bank is
responsible for managing
currency, monetary supply
and importantly, interest
rates which affect the
cost of borrowing money.
Generally, the FED can
be extremely slow to
react and alter rates espe-
cially to the yield curve
whether that’s caused by
layers of bureaucracy or
simply a skepticism of the
indicator. However, the
Federal Reserve unusu-
ally abandoned its policy
to continue raising rates
this year and instead cut
them from 2.4% to 1.55%
in line with what the yield
curve was suggesting.
Interestingly, the move
weakened the omen-ness
of the yield curve because
it’s no longer an independ-
ent analysis of economic
outlook but rather a piece
of data the FED uses to
inﬂuence policy.
Fortunately, the yield
curve has since reversed

turing and retail sales
experience a decline over
six months? A recession-
where growth is negative
over two consecutive
quarters. We all remem-
ber the ﬂabbergasted
investors, underwhelmed
executives and even the
distraught homeowners
losing their livelihoods as
a result of the so-called
Great Recession of 2008.
Yet, what if there had
been an indicator that
had correctly predicted it
“... what if

about a year in
advance ”
Negative spreads between the 3 and 10-year bonds are signalled by the graph dipping below the zero line . Conventional wisdom argues
that this is a sign of investors having a pessimistic outlook for the short term //Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
itself, but by no means
does that sound the all
clear; a simple expla-
nation could be that the
inversion was caused by
a false alarm in the in-
vestment community with
fears such as US-China
relations and Brexit
mounting. However, a
more cautious perspective
could be that we are yet on
the road to the next reces-
sion. In fact, the last three
economic recessions all
completed a full reversal
before collapsing a year or
so later so the bullet may
still be on the way.
about a year in advance.
In fact, this powerful eco-
nomic omen is called the
yield curve and it actually
inverted without fail prior
to every recession since
the 1950s, except once:
August of 2019, as seen
in Figure 1. The graph
commonly known as the
yield curve is actually the
US Treasury yield curve
which simply put, gives
the yield of a bond plotted
over varying maturities
where yield is the ﬁxed
interest of that bond divid-
ed by its price. A bond is a
loan to the government or Bond yields plotted against different maturities at 4 points in the past 20 years // Federal Reserve Economic Data
