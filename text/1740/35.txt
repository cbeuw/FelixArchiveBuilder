changes to the corporate
governance of Japanese
companies taking place
at the moment I think
there will be impetus for
changes in this market.
Having typically hoarded
cash and been resilient to
addressing shareholder
concerns, many Japanese
companies are now much
more aware of how
returns to shareholders are
important. This evolution
in corporate governance
attitudes is already
leading to greater returns
to shareholders.
The Japanese market’s
dividend yield currently
stands at about 2.5%
compared to the S&P
500’s 2% and share
buybacks are up 90%
from 2018. Return on
equity has more than
doubled to 10% since Abe
took office. The manifes-
tation of these corporate
governance changes
will be a driver for the
Japanese stock market
and makes it particularly
attractive, especially at
current valuations (P/E
of approximately 15x
across market in line with
markets like US).
Money Where Their
Mouth Is
Some institutional
investors are beginning
to put their money where
their mouth is. Fidelity In-
The Future Looks Bright for Japanese Equities
ternational became over-
weight Japanese Equities
inNovemberoflastyearas
they anticipate a rebound
in corporate earnings
and relatively cheap
valuations compared to
other international equity
markets. Patrik Schowitz,
Global Multi-Asset Strat-
egist at JPMorgan Asset
Management, recently
spoke to Bloomberg about
the underperformance of
Japanese Equities over the
last few years compared
to the US and why now
would be an opportune
time to invest in this
market as many other
regions’ stocks begin to
look comparatively ex-
pensive.
Equally, Goldman
Sachs expects 8% EPS
growth in 2020 followed
by 6% in 2021. Overall,
the cool-down in trade
tensions between China
and the US, recently
signing a deal to pause
their trade war, is another
welcome boost to both
world markets and
markets in East Asia.
On a macro-level, a lot
will change in Japan over
the next decade. Demo-
graphic transformation,
cultural evolution as the
country becomes more
open to immigration, and
a reassessment of the role
that the country plays in
the international order are
all extremely interesting.
Despite some of these
challenges, I think that
these changes from an in-
vestment perspective will
precipitate strong returns
for those who are over-
weight Japanese equities.
Crucially, an evolution in
the corporate governance
strategies of Japanese
company management
teams will arguably have
the biggest impact on the
stock market and Abe’s
economic reforms will
support this growth.
As the country opens up
to the world for the Rugby
and the Olympics, so too
should investors who are

Elements of Art of War: The Sino-American Trade War

C
an a trade war
be fought in the
same methods
as a physical
war? To find the answer to
this question, one has to
go back in time to an era
of turbulence in the 5th
century BC. The author
of this magnum opus,
Sun Tsu, was the chief of
staff who was confronted
a problem: how to defeat
an enemy, often in a dis-
advantageous situation?
Centuries later, though
much has not changed in
principle, it is needless
to state that the façade
of physical warfare
has changed with the
evolution of weaponry.
Similarly, trade wars and
currency wars did not
change much either in the
last centuries. All tactics
of a field war may be used
in both contexts: elements
of surprise, force of
attack, plan and strategy.
In this article the author
will investigate exactly
that in the perspective
of the trade war between
United States and China.
Death Ground
United States is without
doubt the party with larger
size and consequently
bigger caliber. So how can
China hold off repeated
attacks in form of sanc-
tions and political pres-
sures? Sun Tsu gave us
the answer: ‘Should you
be outnumbered; the best
route is retreat. It is better
to fight with absolute
numerical advantage.’ In
simple words, divide and
conquer. Is it possible
for a country as big as
China to evade the pursuit
its adversary? Is the
option of a retreat open?
Unfortunately, the trade
war provides no room for
retreat. Sun Tsu called it
the ‘death ground’. The
only option for the dragon
country is to face that of
the eagle in the eye.
Does this mean that the
trade war has to be con-
ducted in form of trench
massacre? Not necessar-
ily. Though no space is
available for retreat, China
can attack where defense
is light on the American
side while holding off
American assaults on the
other side of the battle-
field, essentially fighting
a van-guard action on
one side while having the
old guard marching onto
the Pratzen height (from
the Battle of Austerlitz).
Indeed, maneuvering is in
the heart of the Art of War,
since a war of attrition
between the two parties
will without doubt lead to
the demise of the weaker
side. As we shall see, the
Chinese are well aware
of this point.To prevent a
rout, China has to hold, at
the very least, in theatres
of sanction and technolo-
gy, where the Americans
have the lead. Chinese
export was hit hard in the
latter half of 2019. The
situation became critical
in November, but it held.
A similar situation devel-
oped in the technology
theatre, where interven-
tions of the Department
of Commerce of the
United States effectively
crippled ZTE by means
of sanction. It also put up
policies against 5G tech-
nology by Huawei due to
security reasons.
Gathering Ammunition
The Chinese govern-
ment also understands
that ‘wars are not won on
evacuations’. The theater
of attack was the foreign
exchange market, in
which the Chinese were
in full control. In the first
place, mainland market is
sealed off to Foreigners
by the implementation of
exchange control. This
creates a layer of insu-
lation between domestic
markets and international
markets. Sun Tzu noted
that ‘all you can do is
to establish a position
ensuring non-defeat - to
win or not depends on
your enemy making a
mistake’. With much fore-
sight, the Chinese govern-
ment then embarked on a
journey to collect as much
Renminbi as possible
in overseas markets. It
further regulated the
offshore Renminbi market
in Hong Kong, mainly
by strictly monitoring its
size. One must understand
that, in order to short a
sovereign currency, the
speculator must be able
to gather enough of the
currency to influence
the market, much like an
attacking army must get
hold of enough ammuni-
tion before any meaning-
ful action. These tactics
effectively eliminate the
possibility of a large-scale
speculative sell-off. In
this scenario, the Chinese
leadership wisely took
away the ammunition
needed to be used by the
other side. All of these
will ensure a non-defeat
result on the Chinese side.
What did the Amer-
icans do in retaliation?
They labeled China as a
currency manipulator, but
was this justified? The
power to control interest
rate and currency outflow
is deeply enshrined in
a state’s sovereignty,
no less than that of its
border. It was the choice
of the Americans that
they shall not manipulate
their currency exchanges,
but they have no right to
force such choice onto
the Chinese who do not
wish to conduct business
in this manner. Hence
this ‘currency manipula-
tor’ label only exerts its
influence on people also
believing in free market.
Such course of action
would take no effect on
the Chinese should they
think sound economic
policy involves govern-
ment intervention in ex-
traordinary times. Trade
war is undoubtedly such
an extraordinary situation.
Will the Chinese turn
out victorious in the trade
war according to Sun
Tzu’s strategies? It is far
too early at this stage to
predict the outcome of the
trade war, but one should
see treaties signed in the
near future.
