No, the U.S. is not “greatest threat to world peace”

I
read with great inter-
est the recent opinion
article of January
10th
by Felix politics
writer Seyed Nasrollahi, in
which Nasrollahi outlines
a few reasons why he be-
lieves “the United States
poses the greatest threat to
world peace at the present
moment.” In support of
this rather aggressive
claim, Nasrollahi cites the
large amount of money the
U.S. spends on defense;
Trump’s recent action to
order the assassination
of the Iranian General
Qasem Soleimani; and
historic examples of U.S.
military action in the
Middle East, which he
calls “imperialism.”
I share Nasrollahi’s
sentiment that the actions

quite
unconvincing

of the current U.S. pres-
ident are often reckless.
(As an important disclo-
sure, I am talking about
my president here. I was
born in, grew up, and
went to college in the U.S.
before finding myself
in this other Western
democracy embroiled in a
political mess.) Certainly,
President Trump’s past
actions in the foreign
policy sphere have been
quite forward, from his
ca’s, and to think that that
country could legitimately
hope to win a direct war
against the United States
is far-fetched, at best.
Instead, the U.S. mili-
tary’s targeted attack on
this Iranian general can
be seen as a successful
deterrent action, of a su-
War as an example, but
I need not remind him
or Felix’s readers that
the actions of the Iraqi
dictator Saddam Hussein
towards Iraq’s neighbor
Kuwait, which in many
ways prompted the U.S.
invasion, were themselves
extremely aggressive and
conflict-inducing, with
Hussein actually invading
that country to seize its
oil fields. Yes, the suspi-
cions that Hussein was
harboring or developing
weapons of mass de-
struction turned out to be
incorrect, but this should
not mask the fact that in
this case, the U.S. was in
many respects not the first
aggressor in the Iraq War.
Nasrollahi attempts to
instigation of a trade war
with China, brinksman-
ship with North Korea,
and decision to move the
U.S. embassy to Jerusa-
lem, among others.
Nonetheless, I find Nas-
rollahi quite unconvincing
when he concludes from
this action, and other
American military actions
in the recent past, that
the U.S. is “the greatest
threat to world peace”
today. First and foremost,
I would point out that
Trump’s strategy of
brinksmanship need not be
as much a threat to peace
as Nasrollahi – and many
others in the media – make
it seem. Unsurprisingly,
worries about World War
III trending on the internet
turned out to be complete-
ly bogus and overreactive,
and I would offer a reason
why Trump’s action did
not come close to precip-
itating any such conflict.
Simply put, Iran’s military
and economic capacities
are no match for Ameri-
“I share
Nasrollahi’s
sentiments

actions of the

perpower against a minor
one, rather than an action
that necessarily produces
conflict, or even comes
close to it.
To go further, one could
even point to historic
examples where just
the opposite of Trump’s
actions – namely, appease-
ment – have facilitated
conflict. Most recently,
many around the world
have actually criticized
the U.S. and other Western
powers for not intervening
aggressively enough in
Syria to prevent the civil
war there, arguing that if
they had maintained the
“red line” that former
President Barack Obama
declared, lives would
not have been saved in
that region. To go a bit
farther back in history,
I need not remind U.K.
citizens of the results of
the appeasement of Adolf
Hitler in the lead-up to the
Second World War. Here,
Prime Minister Neville
Chamberlain’s weak
stance against Hitler,
many historians point
out, facilitated Hitler’s
takeover of Czechoslova-
kia. I do not bring up these
examples to necessarily
support Trump’s actions
today, but merely to point
out that they are not as
much a threat to peace as
Nasrollahi leads readers
to believe.
After his description
of Trump’s actions,
Nasrollahi proceeds to
describe in detail the great
amount the U.S. spends
on defense, without
actually explaining why
a large U.S. military force
in itself creates a threat to
peace. Setting aside for
a moment the important
and acknowledged deter-
rent capacity played by
NATO, which the U.S.
contributes significantly
to but Nasrollahi does
not mention once, the
examples he draws from
the politics of the Middle
East to try to show how
the U.S. military is such
a threat are dubious at
best. He first uses the Iraq

In response to an article two issues ago titled “Is the U.S. a Threat to World Peace?” Gabriel Lipkowitz argues
against the claims made by the other writer. (The article this one responds to is printed on the next page).
“Instead, the
U.S. military’s
targeted
attack on
Soleimani can
be seen as
a successful
deterrent
action”
describe how the Syrian
Civil War is somehow
another example of the
American “imperialism”
– in one paragraph! – but I
failtoseethisconnectionat
all. As I mentioned above,
many have criticized the
U.S. for not getting more
involved to prevent the
horrific bloodshed in this
country. Whether the U.S.
gets involved to prevent
Middle East atrocities or
does not, it is either way
imperialistic and a threat
to world peace, according
to Nasrollahi!
