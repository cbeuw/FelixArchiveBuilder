Students Should Use Mitigating Circu-
mstances
Editor-in-Chief Henry Alman makes the case for why every student who might have been
affected by an issue should use mitigating circumstances – and not feel like they’re ‘cheating’

xams suck.
That’s the
bulk of my
argument. There
is an obvious aspect
to their awfulness,
which is the experien-
tial one – people hate
taking exams. They are
stressful, panic-induc-
ing nightmares during
which the flip of a coin
can decide your future.
Did the lecturer ask
about your best or worst
topic? Who knows! Or
perhaps your neighbour
decided to have a party
last night and you lost
out on sleep. Well, enjoy
also losing out on your
1st degree.
It’s an uncontrover-
sial statement to make,
so I’ll leave that there.
However, there is a
slightly more sinister
aspect to the discussion
that does bear eluci-
dation: a somewhat
exploitative one.
The failure of exams
to accurately and fairly
assess the abilities of
students is well-doc-
umented. Better than
well-documented, it’s
common knowledge –
even common sense.
The conditions do not
even vaguely reflect
real-life conditions; they
often test skills other
than the intended ones
such as rote memory or
short-term focus; and
the arbitrariness of the
conditions on the day
do not lend themselves
to fairness and accuracy
of performance assess-
ment. There are a litany
of studies backing this
up, conducted over
decades.
This is precisely why
performance reviews in
the real world do not
consist of examinations.
Because examinations
suck.
So why are they still
so frequently used as
the primary form of
assessment for virtu-
ally everything we do
outside any actual job in
an actual career?
The simple answer is
that they’re practical.
It’s far easier to herd
hundreds of students
into one room for a few
hours, where they can
be overseen by just a
few examiners. Then,
as gruelling as marking
exams is – trust me, staff
members and postgrads,
I sympathise with you –
they are faster to mark
than a more customised
or project-based as-
sessment, which often
requires supervision.
What this actually
translates to is that
they’re cheaper to ad-
ministrate effectively
than other types of
assessment. And what
that translates to is that
your future is not being
decided based on factors
governing you and your
performance, but rather
by what is cost-effective
for the institution. Spe-
cifically, the institution
that you are paying for
a service, most often
your education or certi-
fication – whether that’s
a drivers’ test or an
Imperial exam.
Let’s put it this
way: they don’t give
exams to PhD students.
They deliberately
choose not to examine
those students whose
genuine, real-world
academic ability on the
professional research
level is being tested.
They instead give time,
space, supervision, and
resources to see what
they can accomplish –
although I’m sure many
PhD students would still
like to have more of all
four of those things.
There is so much
to be said about that.
However, it’s a topic for
another article. What
I want to discuss here
is why this means you
should absolutely use
mitigating circumstanc-
es (MC), even for minor
things.
A lot of students are
reluctant to use the MC
system; some feel it’s
assessment.
The point of MC is
to account for at least
some of the inherent
unfairness of exams –
as outlined above, you
could be ill, tired, have
suffered a bereavement,
any number of things.
MC is not an ‘extra’, a
tool for only the severely
afflicted or the special
snowflakes to use; it’s
an integral part of the
exam system, specifi-
cally there to account
for the how disastrously
poor exams are at deter-
mining your real-world
ability.
Without them, the
exam system is even
more meaningless than
otherwise – a measure
of the wrong skills, and
a measure of whose
neighbours were dick-
heads the night before.
So use them. You’re
being exploited if you
don’t. You are paying
up to £30,000 a year
to learn and then to be
certified based on that
learning. The institution
you are paying to do
so skimps out on that
last part, for the sake of
their own convenience
and wallets. If you
don’t use mitigating
circumstances, consider
them an integral and
necessary part of this
system, you’re letting
them screw you and
pocket the change – and
screwing yourself over
as well by cheating
yourself out of the marks
you’ve worked for.

a version of ‘cheating’
or ‘making excuses’,
some are embarrassed to
discuss their problems,
and others have their
own reasons. I want to
make it clear to you: it is
none of those things. It
is the bedrock on which
examinations are made
even vaguely reasonable
or fair as a method of
