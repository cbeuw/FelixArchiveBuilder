Italian Regional Elections: A Test For Populism
POLITICS
Luca Rameli
Politics Writer
T
he political
climate currently
pervading Italy
is that of uncer-
tainty. As laid out in my
previous article, the rise
of populism in Italy, and
across Europe, has been
a major phenomenon of
the last decade. Now,
populism, with its new,
bold, and controversial
presence on the political
stage, could either further
deepen its roots in Italian
politics or instead be
outright rejected. All of
this could depend on the
result of the elections
taking place on Sunday
26th
in two Italian regions:
Emilia-Romagna and
Calabria.
The former is one of
the richest regions in
Italy, with a thriving
economy and a highly
developed healthcare
system (in Italy this is a
prerogative of regional
government and not
of the central state),
while the latter is the
poorest and plagued by
corruption. However,
though there are deep
socio-economic differ-
ences between them,
they share some politi-
cal similarities: they are
both governed by the
centre-left Democratic
Party (PD). Since the
2016 constitutional
referendum, the PD
has been continually
losing political ground,
to the advantage of the
Northern League and
the Five Star Movement
(M5S). While the M5S,
which has both left and
right leaning members,
seems to be increasingly
divided between these
two currents (some
even suggest a schism
is near), the League,
which is right-wing, has
managed to increase its
numbers by attracting
more moderate electors.
The leader of the
League, Matteo Salvini,
has indeed been able to
put great pressure on
the current coalition
government between
PD and M5S through a
continuous presence in
in recent times in
Emilia-Romagna itself,
where the result of the
elections is the most
uncertain, while in
Calabria a win for the
centre-right coalition
to which the League
belongs is almost sure.
In the richer Emilia-Ro-
magna, the most recent
polls show a narrow
centre-left lead held
by PD and its allies,
followed closely by the
centre-right coalition
and finally trailing
much behind is the M5S,
who has decided to run
alone, separate from
any government allies.
It is this choice of M5S,
along with a consistent
number of undecided
voters, that could swing
the balance in favour of
one or the other of the
contenders.
The fall of the affluent
Emilia-Romagna region
to the centre-right
would be interpreted
as a great blow for
the Democratic Party,
since this is a region
that has always been
left-leaning – indeed,
the Italian Communist
Party was founded there
and retained power in
the area from the end
of the Second World
War to the 90s, even as
other centre-left areas
of the country started to
embrace more moderate,
s o c i a l - d e m o c r a t i c
politics after the Cold
War. However, the
destiny of the region is
still unwritten, especial-
ly with the birth of a new
anti-populist movement
in November 2019, that
of the “Sardine” (liter-
ally the “Sardines”; yes,
the fish). Such a bizarre
name symbolises their
opposition to the loud,
brash political slogans
of populism, and depicts
themselves as the silent
majority, as the sardines
are fish and hence
silent, and supposedly
the party represents
numbers of people large
enough and with big
enough presence that
they could be imagined
as tightly packed in
each constituency, as
sardines are in a can.
Aside from the question
of names, which Italian
political organisations
overall seem to have
poor taste in, this
movement was founded
only a few months ago
by four friends in their
30s and has since spread
to every corner of the
country. Their refusal
to constitute a political
party and their criticism
not only towards right-
wing populism but also
towards some characters
on the left, have helped
them to consolidate
and expand their base.
Unfortunately for Mr
Salvini, the core of this
movement happens
precisely to be Bologna,
the regional capital of
Emilia-Romagna, and it
can be safely said that it
has played a prominent
role in thwarting the
initial lead held by the
League.
A war of words and
digits has hit the region,
with each side compet-
ing to have the highest
number of participants
to each manifestation.
In all of this, political
polarisation is nothing
new in Italy, but its
conjugation with
populism has marked
its adoption of a new,
worrisome shape. Mr
Salvini’s tolerant, often
sympathetic remarks
towards far-right groups
and their stiff stance on
the question of immi-
gration on one side have
mostly contributed to
this happening, but the
continuous portrayal of
the threat of an author-
itarian drift, sometimes
excessively, on the other,
has also played a part.
The racially motivated
online threats directed
from far-right members
towards Senator Liliana
Segre, an Italian Jew
and Auschwitz survivor,
shows just how dim the
situation is and how
deep the dignity of men
can sink. According
to Italian law, demon-
strations and polls or
any form of political
advertisement cannot be
conducted anymore on
the day preceding the
elections, in order to let
people meditate on their
choices undisturbed.
I do hope this will be
useful, but what I can
see right now is just the
calm before the storm,
a storm with unprece-
dented strength, much
like the violent chaos
depicted in paintings by
Turner.
