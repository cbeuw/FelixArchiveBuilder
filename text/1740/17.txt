The One Where They Robbed a Bank
T
he premise of “A
Comedy about a
Bank Robbery”
is quite simple;
a couple of criminals
break out of prison to try
and rob Prince Ludwig
of Hungary’s diamond,
which is being kept in a
Minneapoli bank. Why
would the diamond be
there? I can’t say I’m
quite sure. Not much of
this play makes sense
anyway. This play is more
about the comedy than
the bank robbery and thus
cheap laughs are definitely
favoured over a rock solid
plot.
The first act, and
especially the opening
scene, is a bit of a shock.
For audience members
not entirely sure what
to expect, the humour
seems a bit cringe at first.
Quickly, it is made clear
that neither the writers
nor the actors have taken
themselves too seriously
and that the humour is not
always high brow. Lots of
puns and slapstick humour
are used with a Friends-es-
que amount of situational
irony. However, this does
not mean that it can’t be
appreciated. Sometimes
these jokes are ruined
by being drawn out a
little bit too much, and
just when you think it’s
over, the performers
keep going! The first half
definitely had many more
of these unfunny, drawn
out sequences but as the
audience gets used to
them, the second half flies
by!
Ashley Tucker’s por-
trayal of the classic 1960s
mother with a bit of a fiery
side is brilliant. Every
scene that she was in, I
could not take my eyes off
of her performance. Her
comedic timing, hilarious
mannerisms and overall
attitude guarantee the
biggest laughs from the
audience. If that is not
enough, she also sings
the most, and the most
beautifully, during the
few musical moments.
These choreographed
musical pieces usually
take place whenever there
is some major action: a
car chase for example.
With the impeccable
choreography and the fun
swinging beats, the show
successfully builds up ex-
citement. These musical
moments also add to the
hilarity of the whole play.
I wish there were more
of these unique gems,
which are reason enough
in themselves to come and
see the play.
Another high point is
one of the final scenes,
where the stage is flipped
right on its side with the
floor becoming the back
of the stage. Hilariously,
this mind boggling,
gravity defying setup is
definitely not essential
for the performance and
is almost put there as a
curve ball to the actors to
see how they cope with
the new situation. With
actors harnessed up, they
comically make their
way across the stage and
perform gravity defying
tasks. I have to say it took
me a few minutes to even
understand how it was all
working and which way
was up.
Overall, the perfor-
mance feels a bit like an
old Friends rerun and is
tired in parts but hilarious
in others. There is also
an improvised feel to the
show, not that it is, and
the audience finds the
jokes funnier and funnier
as they get to know the
characters and actors. If
you want a bit of laugh
and to see a stage flipped
on its side this is definitely
one to see!
Welcome to West Egg, Old Sport
I
n addition to being
one of the great
American classics,
The Great Gatsby
is also a novel that I feel
strongly attached to,
having analysed it to death
for my English Literature
GCSE. Instead of forming
an adverse reaction to
Gatsby, I was surprisingly
taken aback by its depth,
and its exploration of
universal themes through
the lens of the American
Dream.
With this in mind,
you can imagine my
excitement when I heard
about this immersive
production. I hoped it
would allow me to be
immersed in the world
of Gatsby, help me relate
to the circumstances and
the challenges of 1920s
America, and fall deeper
in love with the book I’ve
held onto dearly for years.
This immersive pro-
duction is wildly fun.
From the moment you
enter the venue, you are
greeted by enthusiastic
staff with American
accents, dressed fully in
1920s attire. The décor
surrounding the entire
room is hidden behind
curtains. However, there
is a bar, which is fully
glammed up in true
Gatsby fashion, serving
themed cocktails. As the
play starts, the curtains
fall to reveal Gatsby’s
fancy pad, complete with
monograms reading JG
(Jay Gatsby), fountains,
and a grand piano.
Fromtheget-go,thecast
does a commendable job
involving the audience,
chatting everyone up and
teaching a fun Charleston
routine, which they ask
the audience to engage in
various times during the
play. The cast is charming
and they bring these iconic
characters to life with an
authentic flair. However,
the transitions between
scenes feel tacky at times,
with the cast simply
asking the audience to
move themselves from
one side of the room to
the other with not much
reason or explanation.
The main problem with
the production is the fact
that a significant effort has
been put into making sure
the immersive experience
is fun, that the depth of the
novel has been reduced to
a mere shadow of itself,
and instead replaced
with quippy one liners.
Gone are the subtexts and
intricacies that made the
original manuscripts so
great. Instead we burst into
our dance routine to amp
up on the ‘immersiveness’
of the production. Rather
curiously, however, by
the second act, the play
kind of gives up on its
idea of making Gatsby
immersive, letting the
audience sit all around the
room and simply watch
everything unravel.
One thing that
confused the hell out of
me was seeing the cast
members escort random
theatre-goers into a side
room for large chunks of
time, at some of the most
important points of the
play, no less. I was never
lucky enough to be chosen
to experience whatever
was in the side room, but
I can’t help but wonder
what might be going on
down there that would
make up for missing out
on the actual plot.
If you’re looking for a
chill night at the theatre,
I would say this isn’t the
right play for you, as it is
often hectic, tiring, and at
all times, way too crowded
to be fully enjoyable.
On leaving, you do feel
immersed in the world of
Jay Gatsby, perhaps more
than you would through
a regular play. However,
I am just not sure if this
makes up for the lack
of depth and substance
which play a considerable
part in making the novel
the work of art is truly is.
