T
he talk was held
in the Huxley,
familiar ground
to the two for-
mer Computer science
students. “All through
our degrees the message
that we were told was
that the way to make
money was to make an
app. But we all know
the feeling of wanting
an app that lets you
hire a dog groomer and
filter for hand size, the
amount of variety can
be intimidating. That
is why today we are
launching Appdr, the
app that helps you find
apps and are inviting all
of you to please invest
quickly.”
The audience’s re-
sponse was positive with
many leaping to their feet
and cheering at the aplomb
of the graduates in front
of them. Others, however,
looked less pleased and
three groups of students
ran out of the room shout-
ing into mobile phones.
Investigations later found
that all three groups have
launched legal proceed-
ings against Jeters and
Dalker and each other for
‘stealing our idea’.
The Imperial has a
proud history of startups
with notable companies
such as Geegle and Nile
all claiming their origins
in the airless computer
labs of Huxley. Vice
Provost Zisabelle Hang
(Racketeering) was also
at the talk and encouraged
students to follow the
example set by the Appdr
founders. “All companies
founded at Imperial have
to give us a 50% stake.
We will get our pound
of flesh.” she chuckled
cheekily.
While the conditions
might not appeal to all
companies and being
their own bosses. The
Entrepreneurial society is
one of the most active at
Imperial, running work-
shops including ‘Lying to
venture capitalists - why
you should get on this
gravy train’ and ‘The finer
points of bankruptcy law -
You don’t have to flee to
Thailand’
In fact the startup
scene has been so vibrant
that it has begun to gen-
erate it own ecosystem.

been two winners.
The faculty heads
have been relaxed about
the surge in amount of
students dropping out to
go to live in their Mum’s
basement.
“When they come back
as mature students, we can
charge them again. In a lot
of ways this is pro cake
pro eating it situation.”
said a representative of
the Mechanical Engineer-
ing department.
The one course not suf-
fering from student drop
outs has been DesEng but
this hasn’t worried them.
“We don’t have
any skills to start a
company” one said. “But
I am convinced that the
moment I leave there will
be loads of job offers.
Tons. I am sure.”
“Imperial has a
proud history

about starting their own
