Importantly, Nasrol-
lahi neglects how U.S.
military involvement in
other areas of the world,
outside the Middle East,
can also serve as a sig-
nificant deterrent force,
to actual aggressor states.
Most would agree that
Russia, having recently
completely destabilized
Ukraine, and North Korea,
launching not infrequent
missile strikes towards its
Southern neighbor, create
far greater instabilities in
the world than the U.S.
And if not for the deterrent
capabilities of the U.S.
military, one wonders
whether these dictator-
ships would not take
even more drastic steps
towards destabilizing
their respective regions.
These countries, led by
radical dictatorships,
can on the whim of their
leaders catalyze, overtly
or covertly, conflict.
On this note, I would
also appreciate a bit
of elaboration by the
author about how the
U.S. democracy is totally
“broken,” as Nasrollahi
claims. If the American
democracy were indeed
as “broken” as it is in
Russia, Iran, or North
Korea, I would agree with
Nasrollahi that its military
would pose a grave threat
to world peace. But this is
decidedly not the case, for
numerous reasons. First,
Trump’s recent impeach-
ment – even if it does not
result in his removal from
office – shows that the
mechanisms of executive
checks are alive and well
in the U.S. Second, I will
soon be mailing in an
absentee ballot to par-
ticipate in the legitimate
elections that occur in the
U.S., nonexistent in those
aforementioned dictator-
ships. And finally, while
at the end of his piece
Nasrollahi cites (quite bi-
zarrely and without elab-
oration) “George Orwell’s
‘1984’ [sic] dystopia,”
suggesting that America
is a “state that sees its
right to run programs of
mass surveillance on its
own people [and] controls
the truth,” I fail to see
how the American media
Donald Trump’s impeachment shows that the mecha-
nisms of executive checks are alive and well // Flickr
“I would
appreciate
elaboration
by the author
about how
the U.S.
democracy
is totally
“broken””
that criticizes Trump so
ferociously today is “con-
trolled” by the state.
In conclusion, while
Nasrollahi rightly inter-
prets Trump’s decision
to assassinate General
Soleimani as quite
reckless, his further
conclusion that America
poses a greater threat to
world peace than the likes
of Russia and North Korea
is far-fetched indeed.
I would respectfully
encourage him to think
more carefully about
Middle Eastern politics,
and American actions
there and elsewhere in
the world, before making
such an accusation.
