The rise, and further rise, of Billie Eilish
B
ack in June
2019 I thought
Billie Eilish had
peaked – how
does one top headlining
Glastonbury to 40,000
people at the age of 17?
The answer is simple
apparently: write the new
007 theme tune at the age
of 18, therefore being the
youngest person ever to
do so.
This of course begs
the question of where she
could possibly go next,
but I’m more intrigued
about how she got here
from her first single
released just over 4 years
ago. There’s no doubt
music is in Eilish’s blood:
her parents are both mu-
sicians, and her brother
Finneas is also musical.
In fact, her first single
‘Ocean eye’s’, was orig-
inally written by Finneas
for his band. As legend
has it, after being asked to
write a song for her dance
class, Eilish recorded her
version of the song with
Finneas and put it on
SoundCloud. From there,
it blew up. The single
itself has Eilish’s iconic
soft vocals mixed with
relaxed beat and synths to
give a dreamy electro-pop
sound. It’s a great song,
but does it scream James
Bond? Definitely not, but
Eilish’s development from
that initial single has been
immense.
Subsequently to the
success of ‘Ocean eye’s’,
Eilish was signed to
Interscope Records and
was being interviewed
by Vanity Fair at 15 years
old; at 16 years old she
was named an Apple
Music UpNext artist after
the release of her first
EP don’t smile at me. In
March 2019, the now
17-year old Eilish releases
her first album, When We
All Fall Asleep, Where Do
We Go? and the budding
star becomes a supernova.
She instantly broke the
record for the female artist
with the most songs in the
top 100, after all songs
(bar one) off the album hit
the charts, subsequently
becoming the first artist
born in the 21st century
to have a US number
one album. She even
knocks off Lil Nas X’s
‘Old Town Road’ after its
19-week stint in the top
spot with her single ‘Bad
Guy’. This album has a
harder edge to it than her
previous EP, with Eilish’s
still whispery vocals
a stark contrast to the
heavy beat and themes
accompanying them; with
this change comes a shift
in appearance, with Eilish
exhibiting a darker edge
to her closet which soon
became legendary.
To put this all into
context, third year un-
dergraduates had just got
those shiny offers from
Imperial when Eilish

blends elements
of funk, dream-
pop, soul and
psychedelia to deliver a
set of well-written tracks
with an ABSOLUTELY
GORGEOUS sonic
pallet. Sweet, juicy and
lilting the EP is a delight
on the ear, bursting with
joy and colour for its
entire 20 minutes.
Cousin Kula formed
in Bristol’s jazz scene,
the 6 piece now live
together, and it shows.
The group forge velvet-
the track to its conclu-
sion. The centrepiece of
‘Stacked’ however (and
the EP as a whole), re-
mains Cousin Kula’s
breathy, multi-tracked
vocals. Their distant, ef-
feminate sound evokes
Beach House, thick har-
monies and more dis-
cernible lyrics, howev-
er, take them a cut above
their predecessors.
ing debut single ‘Bubble
Leaves’ illustrates their
intent to challenge the
London scene’s genre
boundaries (boundaries
which are nebulous at
best already). Cherry
picking elements of jazz,
fusion and electronic,
the young trio concoct-
ed a dizzying 6-minute
odyssey. ‘Treehouse
People’ situates itself
differently on the musi-
cal spectrum.
It’s opening bars
bustle with the sound
of children on a play-
ground accompanied by
a minimal synth. The
track then plunges into
silence, only for a per-
cussive, 8-bit sample to
burst through with a mel-
ody so persistent is feels
percussive. Wobbling
bass and synth (Noah
Stoneman) and kiltering
drums (Zoe Pascal) fol-
low the addictive lick up
a build into the first of a
series of cruising, half-
time choruses.
The harmonic pallet
een tunes whose airy
grooves could play for
hours, as they likely
have been. Each lis-
ten to their second EP
STROODLES imbues
me with more confi-
dence that every track
has been slavishly
worked out in advance,
with a plethora of ide-
as propelling each tune
through to completion,
despite the languid
tempos here, there is
scarcely a dull moment.
Deciphering the
sounds on SROODLES
can be a challenge, al-
beit a welcome one.
‘Stacked’ plays back
like Willy Wonka &
the Chocolate Factory
(1971) on half speed.
Arriving over oozing,
chorus-laden guitars
and shimmering re-
versed melodies, drums
and bass lay down a
perfectly tight groove.
Synth and guitar add
sparkle throughout,
alongside a tight bar-
itone sax riff to drive

Music Editor
released her first EP:
Eilish now has a US/UK
number one album, six
top-40 songs including
a number one single
and is nominated for six
Grammys. No comment.
To pinpoint where it
all went so right for her
though is difficult. She
has obviously grown
up in an environment
that may well have been
preparing her for all of
this and being signed
certainly helps. However,
with streaming services
nowadays it is easy to blur
the lines between genres,
and Eilish’s unique blend
of electro-pop, industrial
rock and hip-hop, as well
as her intriguing style,
attracts a wide and varied
audience. In brief, things
have clearly worked well
for her, and (irritatingly)
perhaps that’s just down
to pure talent.

Track Review
T
r e e h o u s e
People’ is the
latest single
from the South
London group Zeñel.
With impeccable pro-
duction and rhythmic
intrigue, the tune is so
engrossing it made me
miss my tube stop.
Some might recall
Zeñel from a ‘Felix Rec-
ommends...’ 2 weeks
ago. Their mind-bend-
of ‘Treehouse People’
shows a strong dance
influence. It’s simple,
well-built melodies and
progressions leave plen-
ty of space for the tal-
ented trio to decorate,
the result is a tune that
is not just catchy, but
infinitely listenable and
impossibly fun.
The standout lead
instruments, first a
blown-out flute, then a
semi-psychedelic vocal
sample, deliver licks so
squarely on beat, and
just staccato enough to
hold down the pulse.
This allows the drums
to explore, garnishing
jazzy rhythmic patterns,
including a time-bend-
ing loop of quaver
triplets that acceler-
ate across beat at the
one-minute mark (keep
an ear out).
Any fans of electron-
ic, or those looking to
hear something new and
exciting would serve
themselves well giving
this track a listen.
