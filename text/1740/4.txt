Felix: Recently, IC
Exposed has been
blowing up with
people talking about
you – affectionately
termed‘Ribbon Guy’.
ZL: Yeah, that was
quite unexpected!
Felix: So this has
come out of no-
where, you thought
you were just doing
your thing and no-
body noticed?
ZL: Yeah, I’ve been
doing this for weeks
now and it’s been chill
– nobody said anything
about it. All of a sudden,
in the last couple of days
it’s gone from 0 to 100
real quick.
Felix: The power of
viral posting I guess!
How does it feel
being at the centre of
attention, a BNOC?
ZL: It doesn’t feel too
different; I mean maybe
whenIgooutIgetacouple
more selfie requests from
time to time. Aside from
that, I just enjoy doing my
own thing. I’m sure it’ll
die down soon – it’s just
hype, memes come and
go.
Felix: So you started
doing this just a few
weeks ago – have
you begun rhythmic
gymnastics recently,
or is this something
you’ve been doing
for some time?
ZL: I only got my first
set of ribbons maybe two
months ago – in Novem-
ber. I didn’t even know
it had a name until after-
wards. I’m not profession-
ally trained in rhythmic
gymnastics or dance,
I’m literally just making
things up as I go! I’m a DJ
and I like listening to good
music, a lot more than the
average person. I just feel
like moving – I gotta keep
moving. Whenever I go
out to clubs, whether I’m
working as a DJ or not, I
like to dance to my own
music. The ribbons were
a recent addition because
I just thought it would be
funny.
Felix: So you got into
this sort of random-
ly – why the Queen’s
Lawn, just for practi-
cality?
ZL: Yeah, I do need the
space – I do high tosses
into the air. Besides that,
I like the outdoors, wide
spaces. I always go at
around lunchtime when
the day is warmest, and
when the sun just reflects
off of the windows and
makes the grass warm.
And where else would I
do it?
Felix: This is some-
thing you’ve kicked
off on your own –
would you be inter-
ested in setting up a
society, or growing
and doing with other
people?
ZL: People are very
welcome to join me on
the lawn, maybe we can
get something going. But
I want it to be gradual,
rather than making a
society. At the end of the
day, what I’m doing is
about being your individ-
ual self, and not having to
follow a certain set of pat-
terns or rules. That’s why
I’ve been hesitant to join
dance societies and such –
it could be good fun, but
I don’t feel like I could
follow a choreographed
pattern very well, I just
want to do what I feel like.
Felix: Is that desire to
express individuality
via either your music
or dancing some-
thing that results
from your experienc-
es at Imperial and
on your course, or is
it from earlier than
that?
ZL: The feeling became
stronger when I was doing
my undergrad. I help out
with the MechEng depart-
ment, aiding students and
such, and would say I’ve
been put into a leadership
position in multiple cases.
That’s helped me become
more confident, and to
care less. Be a bit less
stressed, take things as
they come.
Felix: Do you think
more people at Im-
perial should push
themselves to get
out there, follow this
mentality of individ-
uality and less stress
you’ve outlined?
ZL: I don’t know,
because each person
has their own specific
problems and issues.
There isn’t a ‘one size fits
all’. But if everyone just
cared a little less about
the standards that other
people have set for them,
and to just go about setting
their own standards, they
would be much happier.
Felix: It would be
good to hear about
‘the man behind Rib-
bon Guy’. What’s your
story?
ZL: I’m Malaysian,
and studied there for
primary school. Then I
went to Singapore for a
bit for my IB, and came
to Imperial after for my
Mechanical Engineering
degree, before moving
onto the PhD here. I can’t
leave this place for some
reason!
Felix: Stockholm Syn-
drome?
ZL: I guess you can
call it that! On the side
I usually DJ. You can
usually see me playing
at ACC, some external
events for the medics, and
sometimes Ministry of
Sound.
Felix: So what got
you into music? That
seems to have put
you onto the track of
rhythmic gymnastics.
ZL: That already set
in during my early teens.
I really liked listening to
music, for some reason.
Back when I was a teen-
ager, my family were like
‘it’s just a teen phase,
you’re being antisocial
with your headphones
in’ and so on. Well guess
what, now it’s my job!
