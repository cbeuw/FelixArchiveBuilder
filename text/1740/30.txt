arlier this month
we were treated
to a healthy
portion of
Pokémon news in a 35-
minute presentation by
the Pokémon company,
taking place far from their
typical Pokémon Direct in
May. Right off the bat we
were treated to a nostalgia
rich trailer for the newest
remake in the franchise…
Pokémon Mystery
Dungeon: Rescue Team
DX.
This is a remake of the
original Blue and Red
Rescue Team games,
for the DS and GBA
respectively. From the
trailer alone it looks to be
a faithful recreation of the
originals, with a beautiful
hand-drawn art style
and a 3D environment
which only elevates that
of their predecessor. The
best part? It is slated for a
March 6th, 2020 release,
with a demo available
right now; and yes, of
course I have played it.
Straight away you are
greeted by an old friend,
the personality quiz.
Anyone who played these
games as a child surely
has fond memories of
this. The idea of the quiz
is to figure out which
Pokémon is best suited
to your personality,
whether kind and quirky,
or as the game brutally
labelled me: “annoying
and alienating”. Jeez
Game Freak no need to
be mean. The quiz is not
always the most accurate
in choosing your favourite
Pokémon, but luckily
there is the welcome
addition of letting you say
‘no’ and instead choosing
your own starter. I chose
Psyduck (my fave), chose
Bulbasaur as my partner
and off I went.
When the game
threw me into the world,
I immediately noticed
how gorgeous the game
simple, as well as roughly
an hour of gameplay
between the dungeon and
the town. The town was
really something else.
Bustling with atmosphere
and things to do, such as
visiting the Kecleon shop,
or depositing items in the
Persian bank so you don’t
lose them when you faint.
Seeing this area I loved as
a child reimagined is such
a gift.
As it is only the begin-
ning, I naturally found the
demo fairly easy; if you
are worried about diffi-
culty, don’t be. The game
gets much, much harder
with 100 ﬂoor dungeons
near the end game truly
testing your skills as a
gamer.
The demo is quite
short at roughly an hour
long, but that’s okay. If
you have played the game
before, it is an amazing
nostalgia kick and if
you haven’t, it begins
an enticing story that is
sure to draw you in and
convince you to buy the
game to find out more.
Definitely check it out if
you haven’t already!
A nice summary of what you can expect from the demo of everyone’s favourite Mystery Dungeon game. Blue and
Red Rescue Team have been fused into one complete package and oh my, does it look glorious!

“The hand-
drawn
aesthetic
combined with
the amazing
sound brings
that extra drop
of charm to a
game already
full of it”
looked. The originals
had a wonderful, sprite-
based art style, but the
hand-drawn aesthetic of
this remake combined
with the amazing sound
track really brings that
extra drop of charm to a
game already full to the
brim with it. As far as I
can tell, the dialogue is
almost identical – this is a
good thing when the story
is one of the best in any
Pokémon game ever.
This is all well and
good, but what is a
Mystery Dungeon game
without good dungeons?
Luckily, the combat,
exploration and team
building are the same as
it was all those years ago:
refined and joyous. The
gameplay is simple and
repetitive but hopelessly
addictive – it is a Pokémon
game after all. However,
it is so wonderfully
refined, with the stunning
background making the
dungeons even more en-
joyable to explore and the
UI showing all the infor-
mation you need without
taking up much of the
screen (both in handheld
and docked mode). You
travel through multiple
ﬂoors of a dungeon,
fighting Pokémon as you
go, in a turn-based grid
system. The demo gives

short tutorials, which
remind you of the basics
without being insultingly
