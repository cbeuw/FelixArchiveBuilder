This article forms
part of a series on the
rent negotiations;
see ‘Union Council
Votes 36:1 to Reject
Increase in Halls Rent
Price’ and ‘College
Plans to Increase Halls
Rent Again; Union to
Negotiate Prices’ on
the Felix website.
T
he Union Council
voted on 21st
January to once
again reject a
revised five-year rent
price plan constructed
by the College between
early December and
mid-January.
The revised deal works
on the same “break-even”
financial model as the
one originally proposed
late in 2019, which was
debated and eventually
rejected via vote by the
Union Council in early
December.
The original version of
the increase would have
seen prices increase by
12.2% on average across
all halls rooms next
year, despite the opening
of the 710-bed Kemp
Porter halls in Autumn
2020, with a subsequent
increase of 2.5% per year
to account for inflation.
Criticisms levied at this
“break-even” model – in
which revenue is theoret-
ically set to match costs
(such as paying off the
debt for building the new
hall) – were numerous.
Particularly controversial
was the inflation offset,
estimated by the College
at 2.5% per year, being
significantly above the
rate of inflation for 2019
(1.8%), and not account-
ing for the fact that many
costs – such as the debt
owed on the building –
will not actually increase
with inflation.
Additionally, the value
of Pembridge hall –
whose debt has now been
paid off and is retiring
as a hall, to become a
leased-out property – is
not considered, and costs
which were previously
not factored in (such as
the cost of central staff
working on halls) are now
included.
The deeper concern is
that student welfare will
be adversely affected –
either by ‘pricing out’
less wealthy prospective
students, or creating
a large ‘class divide’
between students in Acton
and South Kensington.
Since this rejection
by the Union Council
in December, the Union
President and Deputy
President (Welfare) have
re-entered negotiations
with the College’s
Campus Services. Two
further meetings were
held before the Christmas
break – at the latter of
which, it was agreed that
certain information would
be passed on to the Union.
A significant portion
of that information, the
Union President says,
never arrived.
A revised deal was
then proposed, in which
the rise in rent would be
‘smoothed’ – instead of
12.2% followed by 2.5%
every year, it would be a
flat 5.5% increase every
year. This would result
in lower rents than the
previous model for the
years 2020-2023, but
higher rents for 2023-25,
and still used the same fi-
nancial model the Council
had criticised.
To address this, the
most recent offer was
that the lowest point of
the curves for each of
the two proposed models
would be taken – in other
words, a 5.5% increase for
the years 2020-2023, and
a 2.5% increase for the

The College and Union’s negotiations resulted in a revised deal based on the same “break-even” financial model;
Union Council rejected the proposal on the same basis as in December. Rent strikes have been proposed
“The inflation
offset of 2.5%
per year is
significantly
above the
2019 rate
of inflation
(1.8%)”
which was the cause for
the initial rejection, had
not been re-assessed, and
requested information
had not been provided.
Although the reduction
could be viewed as a
token ‘win’, the Council
had mandated itself in
December to oppose the
financial model proposed
by College, and so only a
rejection was considered
appropriate.
A College spokesper-
son said:
"We don’t believe we
should make either a
surplus or a loss on student
accommodation. Running
our halls at cost means we
will be able to renew our
first-year undergraduate
accommodation at the
appropriate time, so future
generations of students
can have access to similar
facilities and support
services.
"It is also important
that we ensure rent for our
first-year undergraduate
halls is lower than ac-
commodation of a similar
standard in the open
market and other compa-
rable London universities,
and we carried out a
benchmarking exercise to
make sure of this.
"The proposed rents
are in line with the New
London Plan as approved
by the NUS which says
35% of new student ac-
commodation should cost
no more than 55% of the
maximum maintenance
loan provided by Student
Finance England. There
are also cheaper beds
available in a variety of
locations to reduce the
disparities in rent between
different halls."
After the vote, conver-
sation at Council turned
to discussion of ‘next
steps’. While many were
in support of further
action – whether to raise
petitions or act via some
other campaign – the con-
versation took a cold turn
when the mention of rent
strikes naturally arose.
Rent strikes at univer-
sities have previously
proven to be effective. In
2016, students at Gold-
smiths, Roehampton, and
UCL engaged in a rent
strike costing around £1
million in revenue. This
resulted in a rent freeze,
as well as an increase
in the accommodation
bursary. However, they
also come with risks.
The College can legally
evict students for not
paying rent – though this
is relatively unlikely, due
to reputational risk for the
College and prior strikes
at other universities have
not resulted in evictions.
It also places a large
burden on predominantly
first-year students, going
through exams for the
first time, to represent
the views of students
determined via a referen-
dum available to students
from all years. The latter
concern was the one most
expressed at Council.
Representatives felt
they needed more time to
process and consider the
ramifications of such an
action. The student reps
will meet again in two
weeks to discuss what
the Union should do next,
pending the outcome of
further conversations
between the College
and the Union President
and Deputy President
(Welfare) – who will
meet with the Provost on
Monday.

years 2023-2025.
Depending on the split
between South Kens-
ington and Acton halls,
this revised model could
still see halls in South
Kensington be priced at
over £300 per week by
2024. This offer was pre-
sented to Union Council
on Tuesday, and rejected
in a vote of 29 to 3, with
a further two members
abstaining.
Feedback in conver-
sation at Council was
almost unanimous – the
