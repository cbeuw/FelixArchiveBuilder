T
he English
National Ballet’s
70th Anniversary
Gala took you
through the history of the
company in the special
two-and-a-half-hour long
event. It was a great cele-
bration of dancers, artists,
choreographers, musi-
cians, and everyone else
who has been involved
in the company’s history
- the “English National
Ballet Family”. The per-
formance was ﬁlled with
passion, joy, and pride and
there was a true sense of
community both on stage
and in the audience.
What made this perfor-
mance so unique was the
direction, and the structure
of the performance was
extremely well thought-
out. Each small section
started with a screening
of a short ﬁlm or a video,
followed by a perfor-
mance on a related theme.
Making use of archive
footage and pictures of the
company from the past, it
helped the audience to un-
derstand the background
and history behind a show
or a repertoire, which
does not usually happen
in a ballet performance.
A particularly heartfelt
example of this was the
segment about the English
National Ballet School.
The ﬁlm explained the
importance the company
places on education and
inspiring the younger
generations and the per-
formance that followed
was given by the current
students of the school.
This structure gave a con-
sistent ﬂow and essence
to the performance and
helped link various pieces
that may have been
completely unrelated in a
meaningful order.
It was regrettable that
the lengths of the perfor-
mances varied signiﬁcant-
ly. Some pieces seemed
too brief while others ran
for a disproportionately
long time. It seemed that
the limited time could
have been better allocated
to make the performance
more engaging, as some
pieces often became
repetitive. The dancing
was also not completely
polished, especially in
group performances.
Some of them were no-
ticeably out of sync which
did not present the chore-
ography and the dancers
themselves to their full
potential.
Nonetheless, show-
casing some of the most
symbolic pieces and
greatest hits, the English
National Ballet’s 70th
Anniversary Gala gave
the audience a unique
and rare opportunity to
watch a variety of work
throughout their history.
The performance repre-
sented the historic story
of the English National
Ballet in an innovative
manner. Whether or
not you are a ballet fan,
this event exposes the
audience to a wide range
of the company’s work
along with the history and
allows the audience to
experience and celebrate
what English National
Ballet stands for.
