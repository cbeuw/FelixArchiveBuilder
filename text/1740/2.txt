5 vs. 30 Minutes: PR is Key
P
R and marketing
are important.
Billions upon
billions are
invested into it every
year, by every company
from Apple to your local
chippy. Whether it’s in the
graphic design of the logo,
the name of the company,
the way it responds to
criticism, the press rela-
tions it forms with various
publications, sponsor-
ships, or anything else, it’s
indisputably essential to
the operation and success
of any organisation.
There are good reasons
for this. You need people
to think well of you to
succeed. In the corporate
world, there’s an obvious
incentive: money. The
same applies to charities.
In politics, the currency
is votes instead, but it
amounts to the same
thing – you need people
to give you some of what
they have, some of the
appropriate currency.
In some cases that
currency is the nebulous
concept of ‘goodwill’. In
other words, you need a
particular community to
support you in something.
This is often especially the
case with campaigns – on
the national scale, one can
point to an organisation
like Extinction Rebellion,
or more locally we could
point to a little organisa-
tion called ‘the student
union’.
Theunionneedsstudent
goodwill to be functional.
There’s a financial aspect,
as always – if students like
union events, they’ll buy
tickets, and the union can
turn a profit. However,
that money is directly
re-invested back into
students and their activi-
ties, so the real currency
here certainly isn’t GBP.
To understand the need
for ‘goodwill’, you have
to think about what the
union’s goal is.
It is, predominantly,
to represent students and
cater to their needs. That
can be food or drinks, it
can be supporting clubs
and societies, or it can be
campaigning or advocat-
ing for student rights and
welfare.
In the latter cases,
student goodwill allows
the union to take a firmer
stance, to put more
pressure on the College,
and to organise larg-
er-scale demonstrations
of student opinion – from
the simple petition to the
drastic strike.
It’s clear that to achieve
its goal, the union needs
students to believe in it
and be on its side. Natu-
rally, it has to earn that,
and whether you believe
in the union or not is a
separate discussion. What
I want to discuss, though,
is how this necessitates a
strong PR presence.
There is a marketing
directorate within the
union – with which
Felix, for the sake of
clarity, works somewhat
closely regarding the
Union pages and adverts.
That’s there for obvious
reasons; the union needs
marketing materials for
its events and campaigns,
and needs experts to help
realise and broadcast the
student voice. However,
PR comes in at every
level and every decision
made – not just within that
directorate.
An interesting anecdote
was mentioned offhand
at Union Council on
Tuesday – the Community
and Welfare Board had
decided to propose the
introduction of a Working
Class Officer. I can sense
some of you flinching a
little bit at the name now,
because discussing class
is still a little bit taboo
at times – especially for
many Imperial students,
who come from wealthier
backgrounds and risk
being considered snobs.
This uncomfortable
feeling was raised by a
few people at the meeting,
who wondered if a better
name was possible.
After all, many people
who would not consider
themselves traditionally
working class would also
need to be represented by
this officer (hell, I was one
of them, broke as can be.)
A few options were
discussed. Indeed, the
majority of the discussion
was about the name,
and very little about the
substance of that par-
ticular proposition. This
is because everyone, it
seemed, clearly agreed
that it was a good idea.
It was said that the
CWB, on initially discuss-
ing the idea, had spent five
minutes agreeing on the
idea, and 30 minutes on
the name. The same sort
of ratios were seen in the
Union Council meeting.
The proposition was voted
through 32 to 1, with
overwhelming support,
alongside other Liberation
and Community reforms –
bravo to the DPW for that
victory.
However, it did get me
thinking. PR is essential
for generating goodwill,
and goodwill is essential
for achieving goals, and
so one has to consider PR
in every decision their
organisation makes. Fine.
I just sometimes wonder if
many of us, as the students
whose goodwill is being
sought, are a bit too picky.
We’re perhaps a little too
demanding of what we
will give our goodwill to.
Wearenotnearlysodis-
cerning with our money –
nor, in the broader world,
our democratic right to
vote. So many voting-el-
igible Imperial students
will not have voted in the
recent general election. So
many of us keep giving
our money to Amazon.
And yet here we have
a situation where an
organisation whose sole
point of existence is to
provide for us is spending
six times as long worrying
about whether we’ll tear
them apart for a slightly
awkward name, than
worrying about whether
to introduce it. They
don’t need to do the latter
because it is clearly an
excellent idea – but in
that case, why should they
have to do the former?
Would we really be so
reactionary as to criticise
an uncontroversially ben-
eficial idea for the sake
of a little bit of awkward
– not even bad – PR sen-
timent?
I think we would. And
maybe that’s a problem.
Once again, I offer no
solutions. Just food for
thought.
