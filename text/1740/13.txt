and America. There is
abundant literature con-
cerning the U.S military
footprint on global
politics. I will only go
over the U.S footprints in
the Middle East in the last
two decades.
Afghanistan
Since the United
State’s invasion of Af-
ghanistan in 2001, the
U.S has spent 975 billion
US dollars on the war in
Afghanistan. During the
eighteen years of their
presence, the U.S military
forces have dropped more
than 30,000 bombs on
Afghanistan’s soil. This
has caused the death
of hundreds of Afghan
civilians every year. In
fact, U.S air strikes have
killed more civilians in
Afghanistan than terrorist
forces. Despite all that,
Afghanistan is still strug-
gling with the presence
of terrorists. It is hard to
tell if the U.S invasion
has done the country any
good at all.
Iraq
The U.S formed a coa-
lition, including the UK,
to invade Iraq in 2003 in
an attempt to overthrow
Saddam Hussein’s regime
as he was suspected of
having weapons of mass
destruction. Of course,
no such weapons were
ever found, and the claims
were found to be bogus.
Almost all countries in
the coalition including the
UK came to the consensus
that the Iraq war was a
terrible mistake. Not only
did it incur billions of
dollars in cost, it ruined
a country, spread hatred
and violence in the world,
and caused the death of
hundreds of thousands
of innocent civilians.
General Stanley Mc-
Chrystal, the commander
of Joint Special Forces
who fought Al-Qaida in
Iraq, acknowledged that
U.S military’s presence in
Iraq was the motivation
for the Al-Qaida insur-
gents to migrate to Iraq in
the first place.
Syria
There is plenty of
evidence on how the U.S
had been planning to
overthrow Bashar Asad’s
regime. Leaked cables
from U.S administration
show how they had been
planning to cause chaos
in Syria since 2006, five
years before the war
erupted. You can google
‘Influencing the sarg in
the end of 2006’ and read
one of such cables in
Wikileaks for yourself.
The book ‘The Wikileaks
Files’ provides plenty
of evidence on how the
United States government
has had an agenda of
pursuing imperialism in
the world in the name of
national security. The civil
war in Syria eventually
led to millions of refugees
and a total civilian death
toll of more than one
hundred thousand.
When power, imperial-
ism and failed democra-
cy meet
When power, imperial-
ism and failed democracy
meet, it will create a state
very much like George
Orwell’s ‘1984’ dystopia.
A state that sees its right
to run programs of mass
surveillance on its own
people. A state that
The M1 Abrams, a symbol of US imperialism // US Marines
controls the media, and so
controls the truth. A state
that feeds people of that it
considers a threat to their
national security appara-
tus. It doesn’t matter who
the enemy is, but there is
always an enemy. Orwell
understood human nature
quite well, “power is not
a means, it is an end”. If
we fail to realise that such
a state could actually
exist, and would happily
screw others over to
reach its ends, then I very
much fear that Orwell’s
prophecy would not be far
from truth: “If you want
a picture of the future,
imagine a boot stamping
on a human face – for
ever.”
