The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964)
G
oing into this
film I expected
a full-blown
Singing in the
Rain-esque musical, but
this was a musical like
no other. With no heavily
choreographed dancing
and no distinct songs, it
sets itself apart from, and
above, all musicals I’ve
ever seen before. In The
Umbrellas of Cherbourg,
every word of dialogue
is sang in tender sing-
song and accompanied
by gentle tunes. I believe
without first hearing this
for yourself, the thought
of this for an entire feature
length film might be quite
irritating, but I found this
to flow so softly and fall on
the ears so pleasantly that
you would be surprised
at how well it works.
Frankly, I think this style
is just as effective (if not
more so) than occasional
outbursts of song.
The Umbrellas of Cher-
bourg follows an ill-fated
romance between teenage
Geneviève (Catherine
Deneuve), who helps her
disapproving mother run
the town’s umbrella shop,
and Guy (Nino Casteln-
uovo), a local mechanic,
and the events succeeding
Guy’s draft to serve in the
Algerian War. This could
be following the skeleton
of a plot for any bog-stand-
ard romance, but for some
reason it’s different. The
story feels very real and is
very simple. We get to see
the harsh reality of being
in love, un-sugar-coated,
despite the dreamlike
singing and bubble-gum
sets. This contrast is what
makes some scenes so af-
fective, and is particularly
apparent in the touching
final scene in which you
can’t tell if you’re happy
or heartbroken for the
characters.
With a mouth-watering
colour palette, beautiful
This made it even easier
to appreciate the details
put into the film’s design,
from the matching colours
of Geneviève’s outfits
and the background, to
the dreamy wallpapers.
It is clear to see that
this colourful style has
inspired directors such as
Wes Anderson, and other
musicals, such as La La
Land (but being the proto-
type, it is far superior). It
cannot be stressed enough
how gorgeous this film is.
The creative direction is
simply exquisite.
Whilst in plot this film
is not ground breaking,
in execution it is perfect.
Although the plot itself
is romantic and heart
wrenching, it provides
nothing new and the film
owes its greatness to its
vibrant colours, which
clash with the melancholy
story, and moving score.
The Umbrellas of Cher-
bourg is a technicolour,
musical masterpiece that
everyone must watch in
their lifetime, particularly
on the big screen.
I watched this as part of
the BFI’s musical season
and would highly recom-
mend catching one of its
features before the season
reaches its end at the end
of this month.
