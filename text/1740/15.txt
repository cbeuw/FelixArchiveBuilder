have lead to the declaring
of such a party illegal,
however, not in Spain.
Nevertheless, this not
the last link that the PSOE
had with terrorism. For
example, during the 2004
election campaign they
used the al-Qaeda Madrid
train bombings, where
193 people died and over
2.000 where injured, that
occurred three days before
the election as an electoral
argument against the
incumbent conservative
government.
In 2011, the PSOE
pressured the Constitu-
tional Court to legalize
the political arm of the
terrorist group ETA lead
by Arnaldo Otegi, who
had been sentenced to
prison for being part of
the terrorist group and
taking part in several ter-
rorist attacks such as the
kidnapping of entrepre-
neur Luis Abaitúa. This
political arm of ETA was
previously banned by the
Supreme Court but finally
legalized in the Constitu-
tional Court with 6 votes
in favour and 5 against.
In 2016 Pedro Sanchez,
whose doctoral thesis
has been accused to be
plagiarized, won a motion
of censorship against a
functional government of
Mariano Rajoy with the
support of the Catalan
coup perpetrators and with
those who have blood on
their hands, the political
arm of ETA. The main
arguments for this censor-
ship, that led to 3 years of
unstable government, was
the corruption case of the
party of Mariano Rajoy
known as ‘Gürtel’, which
supposed a loss to public
finances of €120M. This
amount, although high, is
less than a tenth of what
the PSOE was responsible
for losing
All in all, we can say
that the history of the
PSOE is the history of
a criminal party, from
its establishment to the
present day counting
among its crimes death
threats, murders, coups,
electoral fraud, alliances
with terrorists and being
the most corrupt party in
Europe. The logo of the PSOE // Wikipedia
Spain’s New Government: A Progressive Coalition
Politics writer Julio Perez gives insight on the outcome of the Spanish elections.

T
hese past weeks
mark a turning
point for Spanish
politics. After
two general elections,
a majority was finally
agreed in the parliament
to form a government. The
self-named progressive
government is a coalition
of the Spanish Socialist
Workers’ Party, or PSOE,
(social democrats) and
Unidas Podemos (left-
wing), who have agreed
on a program based on
social justice, democratic
rights, and a sustainable
economy.
This government is
the result of the past
November elections,
which saw the rise of the
far right and a victory for
PSOE that still did not
give them a majority. This
led, in less than 24 hours,
to an agreement between
Pedro Sanchez (PSOE)
and Pablo Iglesias (Unidas
Podemos); even though
April elections attempts to
form a coalition had been
fruitless. The partners
still did not sum up the
required number of seats
and had to unite with
other smaller parties to
gain a majority. These
agreements made the PM
investment ceremony
that followed one of the
most polemic in modern
Spanish democracy, with
right-winged parties re-
jecting the legitimacy of
the democratically elected
government.
Broadly speaking, the
government’s program
is of a classic social
democratic character. The
coalition is conscious of
the climate crisis with one
of their main goals being
to achieve zero carbon
emissions by 2050 and
the implementation of
the UN’s 2030 agenda
for sustainable develop-
ment. Culturally, their
aim is to challenge the
conservative paradigm by
making policies that will
secure rights conquered
by popular movements in
the recent years, such as
the feminist or LGBT+
collectives. In this sense
they have created the
ministry of equality and
plan on reinforcing the
gender violence law. On
the economic side, their
fundamental axis is the
restoration of public
services and spending,
which had been cut to
minimums in the previous
legislatures, and defend-
ing workers’ rights and
their material conditions.
They have already started
working on this by in-
creasing the minimum
salary, reinforcing trade
unions, and regulating the
housing market in certain
areas. Geographically,
the government’s greatest
challenge is to deal with
the depopulation of rural
areas, which they plan on
solving with the restora-
tion of public transport
and economic incentives
that will encourage migra-
tion to the countryside.
This is the first coalition
government in the history
of Spanish democracy, the
first one with members
of Unidas Podemos, a
party born out of popular
movements, and the first
elected left government in
Spain in nearly a decade.
Although the coalition
may not bring radical
change to the country,
it serves as a historical
reference for a period
where the far right rises
and the market “frees”
itself more than ever from
the hands of politics. As
deputy MP Pablo Iglesias
said, “politics is the art
of riding contradictions”
and even though this gov-
Pedro Sanchez, leader of the PSOE // Wikipedia
ernment will encounter
many, it will still try to
pose an alternative for the
post-democratic spectre
that is haunting Europe.
