of the PSOE.”
and writes another chapter
in his criminal history,
which dates from its
establishment to our days
and will be recapped in
this article.
The criminal history
of the PSOE begins in
the year 1909, when the
party first gained a seat in
the Spanish parliament.
That year its founder,
Pablo Iglesias, threatened
the conservative Spanish
former president and
leader of the opposition
Antonio Maura, saying:
“We have considered that
before Maura rises to
power, we should commit
an attack”. Two weeks
later he was the victim of
a terrorist attack.
In the year 1934, during
a parliament session and
due to several disagree-
ments, a fight between the
MPs broke out and the so-
cialist MP Indalecio Prieto
pulled a gun on another
conservative MP. Later in
the same year, the social-
ist leader Largo Caballero
led an attempted uprising
against the democratically
elected liberal govern-
ment, arming miners and
other workers. This act of
irresponsibility led to over
2000 deaths, which fall
on the shoulders of the
PSOE.
During the electoral
campaign of 1936, the
last before the civil war,
Largo Caballero said: “If
the right wins, we will
have to declare civil war”
and “If socialism loses
in the polls, we will go
to the violence, because
we prefer anarchy and
chaos to fascism”. In the
end, the ‘Popular Front,
the electoral alliance lead
by the PSOE, won the
elections. Nevertheless, it
has recently been claimed
that this was a result of
electoral fraud. It has been
asserted that the electoral
records were manipulated
giving over 70.000 votes
to the ‘Popular Front. This
outcome led to a fraudu-
lent absolute majority of
the socialist forces and
gave rise to persecution of
political dissenters and the
Catholic Church by militia
the crowd. The murder
of the conservative leader
of the opposition Jose
Calvo Sotelo, by the is
considered the ‘casus beli’
for the military uprising
that lead to the civil war.
On the 1st July 1936 an
MP of the PSOE said
to Jose Calvo Sotelo:
“The violence might be
legitimated. In your case,
everything is legitimated,
including an attack ending
with your life”. On the
13th of the same month
at 3.00 am 1936 Calvo
Sotelo, who had previous-
ly received death threats,
was illegally arrested by
Luis Cuenca, a socialist
militant and bodyguard
of the above mentioned
socialist MP Indalecio
Prieto. He was forced
into a van and then shot
and killed. Five days later
Franco’s military uprising
took place, leading to the
Spanish Civil War, where
120,000 people lost their
lives. Therefore, it is a
dictatorship until 1977
when the party was le-
galized, one of their first
actions was requesting an
amnesty for prisoners be-
longing to terrorist group
ETA, a Basque separatist
organisation.
With no doubt, the most
embarrassing event in
the history of the PSOE,
which occurred between
the years 1983 to 1987
during the government
of the socialist Felipe
Gonzalez, was the dirty
war against the ETA and
the establishment of the
GAL (Antiterrorist Liber-
ation Groups). This was a
death squad aimed to kill
the leaders of the ETA, but
also resulted in the deaths
of 10 innocent people. It
was later proven at trial
that the GAL was led and
financed by the Spanish
Interior Ministry and the
former socialist president
Felipe Gonzalez. In any
developed country, as you
can imagine, this would
forces. The aim of this
group was creating chaos
by burning convents and
monasteries, the murder
of monks and priests
and exercising violence
against dissidents among

holding political activity.
It is estimated that over
the course of the scandal
over EUR 679 million
were stolen from the
Spanish people and spent
on prostitutes and cocaine
amongst other things.
