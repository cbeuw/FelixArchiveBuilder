1917, having sat through
what felt like five minutes
of film, I heard my watch
bleep signalling it was
21:00; but how could
this be, the film started at
20:30? This swift passage
of time is all too apparent
in this war time drama
from Sam Mendes.
The idea behind 1917
seems as alluring as any, a
film made to appear as one
take, set over the course of
the 8-hour journey of two
Lance Corporals as they
make their way through
occupied territory. As
soon as I’d heard about
this one take format of the
film, I was immediately
drawn to the cinematog-
rapher who would be
responsible for this movie
magic, quietly hoping
Emmanuel Lubezki (of
Birdman) would be there,
however in finding Roger
Deakins, I was definitely
not disappointed.
In some ways the cen-
trepiece of the film, this
one-shot format doesn’t
disappoint. From winding
steady shots to shaky
claustrophobic moments,
1917 seriously delivers
an experience unlike
many others in cinema
history. Comparing this
to Birdman is in some
ways unfair, they’re
very different films held
together only by their
format, yet they’re bound
to draw comparisons, and
so I will. In the same way
that Birdman’s mirror
scenes left me scratching
my head as to how they
did it, 1917 delivers in the
same spectacular fashion
too, where the camera
glides seamlessly over
water seen to be totally
isolated, over terrain that
looks untraversable, and
all while keeping our pro-
tagonists perfectly in shot.
Roger Deakins is really at
the top of his game here.
The tracking shot not only
serves as an extremely
impressive feat, but it also
completely sucks you in.
Time passes in this film
like no other, where the
stringing together of shots
blurs any concept of time
you have. This results
in a really encapsulating
feeling that you feel you
can’t miss; I was really
wracking my brains as to
how people were able to
leave to go to the toilet
during this film.
The one-shot aspect
isn’t even where the bril-
the tiny, horrific details
throughout the journey,
seen unapologetically as
the real hardships of war,
are shown to us. It puts
you there in a way that a
normal lens just wouldn’t.
We also have to mention
some of the gorgeous shots
in the dusk and night-time
scenes, where the colours
really melt into each other.
The blues at dawn are just
phenomenal.
With a film that follows
its protagonists for such a
long duration, there needs
to be a great performance
to carry the weight of the
story; this comes in the
form of George MacKay
(Schofield). While this is
not a showcase in extreme
acting prowess, he does
act as an excellent vessel
through which the story
is conveyed. He plays the
character honestly and
plainly, letting the gravity
of the situation and scenes
around him fold in and
encapsulate the serious-
ness and difficulty he
finds himself in. Neither
intrusive nor underplayed,
he does an excellent job
throughout the film.
Now all that I’ve said
so far indicates that I
thought this a brilliant
film with nothing at fault,
but even with all this
brilliance there is still
something missing. Due
to the fast paced nature of
the film, I was unable to
fully invest myself in the
story; where everything
was happening so quickly,
there wasn’t quite enough
time to fully flesh out the
characters and something
is left slightly hollow.
The brilliance of the cin-
ematography in contrast
with the slight lack in
character development
makes the whole thing
seem as almost an exercise
in film, rather than a film.
However, when reflecting
on the story and taking in
the context of the events,
I’m left battling with two
thoughts: one in which
the film is accidentally
hollow, and one where it
is purposefully hollow.
If it is the latter, this film
is perfectly showcasing
the hardships of war,
where the fast pace and
horrific events combined
with lack of character is
a perfect description. We
see how impersonal and
brutal the events are, as
we’re dragged through
scene after scene of the
difficulties faced. An out-
encapsulates the journey
he’s faced.
Having seen the film,
one of the things that is
plain to see, is that this
was just so brutal. I think
this too is where the sig-
nificance in the name of
the film lies, 1917. The
end of the film comes,
and it almost feels like the
war should be over, but
it’s not. There’s still over
a year of fighting to come
and with it can only come
more of what we’ve just
seen. This snippet of the
war and how significant
it felt for one person is
felt so strongly in these
final moments that it
really does leave you to
reflect on how much was
given by those in the
war. Although it has its
flaws, this film is truly a
landmark in cinema and
an excellent, visceral por-
trayal of just a slice of the
hardships faced in WW1.
A viceral image of Schofield running perpendicular to the rest of the front line // eOne
standing shot comes, for
me, in one where Schof-
ield is running through a
battlefield, perpendicular
to the rest of the company;
there’s something ex-
tremely visceral in seeing
an unarmed man running
against the line, and truly

liance of the cinematog-
raphy ends, it’s hard to
describe until you actually
see it, but the shots are
almost hyper-realistic.
From my primitive knowl-
edge of cinematography, I
think what I was seeing
is deep focus perfectly
employed throughout a
large majority of the film.
This choice is masterful
from Mendes as we’re not
restricted to focus solely
on the characters, as all
