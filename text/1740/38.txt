find the one that truly suits
you for your perfect Patty
& Bun meal.
Many student deals
have the pesky clause
stating they can only be
used from Monday to
Thursdays, famously the
days when most students
are busy being glued to a
library cubicle, watching
their coursework deadline
inch closer and closer. But
Patty & Bun understands.
They don’t want you to put
your grades in jeopardy
to get your fix. That why
there is no time frame
associated with their deal.
As long as it’s open, you
can cop your meal at the
student price.
The only thing is that
the burger can’t be the
monthly special. This
brand keeps things inter-
esting by having a new
burger added to its menu
every now and again.
Sometimes its collabora-
tions with brands, charities
or even other restaurants.
Sometimes it’s a burger
that finds a permanent
place on the menu if it gets
enough buzz. Either way,
it’s a way of keep spark
in the burger-student rela-
tionship once you’ve tried
every burger. Full details
of the deal can be found

P
atty & Bun,
famous for their
fun variety and
creative collabo-
rations, has made a name
for itself in the London
burger scene but still
won’t relent. They want
to reach us students as
well. And I must hand it
to them, they’ve doing a
great job of reeling me in.
As a foodie, the problem
with South Kensington is
it attracts pricey restau-
rants that hope to take full
advantage of the tourist
clientele without any
regard for the students that
are lost in the sea of school
children holding hands
to cross the street. With
a branch on Pembridge
Road, a stone throw
from one of Imperial’s
Halls of Residence and
a 20-minute walk from
the South Kensington
campus, they’ve got the
location on lock.
Their burgers come
wrapped up in their
branded paper with a
sticker to seal the whole
thing up and remind
you of what’s to come.
Perfect to pick up to take
with you on the commute
to campus. But, like
Pandora’s box, be careful
of where you open them
up. From all the cheese,
sauces and filling they get
stuffed with, these burgers
can look like an explo-
sion! Rather fitting with
the strong, hard-hitting
flavours they employ to
get their signature taste.
It’s a messy endeavour but
at the end of it all you’ve
conquered their beast and
can use their packaging to
put it all away like it never
happened.
Their use of pickling
really sends some of
their burgers from good
to drool worthy just by
the smell when you peel
off the sticker. We’ve
sampled just about
everything to really have
a good insight into what
this brand has to offer…
for research purposes of
course. The classic Ari
Gold’s pickled onions are
bright and tangy with their
smoky mayo rounding out
the whole thing. If I was
to recommend anything to
someone who hasn’t been
before, it would be this.
Their ‘Smokey
Robinson” really lives up
to its name. This burger
isn’t just thicc, it’s thiqué.
We’re talking stacks of
crispy bacon on top of a
thick cut of meat here.
This is juxtaposed by the
sweetness of the cara-
melised onions almost
perfectly and the smoky
sauce brings it all together
for the perfect cheat meal.
“Hot Chic” was
probably the biggest mess
as the creamy coleslaw
got just about everywhere
during this trip. This
one if the most different
from all the other meat
burgers. This is definitely
the lightest of all the
options, but you aren’t
getting away easy. It’s still
indulgent due to the fried
buttermilk batter with the
thick cream and a slight
kick of tanginess from the
pickled cucumber.
The brioche buns are
perfect at preserving the
burger from sogginess
even after being left in my
bag – wasn’t my best call.
They ask how you want
your meat cooked, a tell
that the meat is of good
quality, but they have
missed the mark on our
preference on multiple oc-
casions out. If we inform
them, they change it and
correct but sometimes that
more hassle than its worth
to wait again.
This is all well and
good but its no secret
that London is breeding
ground to inventive burger
places. So why is this the
one I’ve decreed friend to
students? Well at the end
of 2019, they introduced a
new student deal. Now a
meal of any burger, their
rosemary fries and a drink
sets you back £10. That’s
about the price of some of
their burgers alone. This
means you can alternate
between all the burgers to
