Mum is very supportive.
I just really like music
so much, and I feel like I
need to dance to it, to get
it through my system, and
just kept doing it for some
reason. Last summer,
before I picked up the
ribbons, I tried doing it
with a staff. A big strong
thing – I hit myself with it
a number of times!
Felix: You should
try nunchuks. What
didn’t work out with
the staff?
ZL: Oh no, I’d end up
killing myself! And with
the staff, it’s because you
can’t bring it into clubs,
you’d end up hurting
someone. Ribbons are
less likely to do that. I’ve
used them in the Winter
Carnival, a medics event
in Embankment, a show
this past Wednesday at
Embargo Republica, and
I’ll use them in ACC too!
It just really makes things
more fun.
Felix: Where can
people catch up with
what shows you’re
doing?
ZL: I do have a Face-
book page, ‘Zhengli Lim’,
as a DJ – though I don’t
maintain it that often. If
you want to follow it,
follow it! I do also have
a public Spotify playlist
which has some of my
own favourite songs on,
which I listen to when I’m
doing my ribbon dance.
It’s called ‘Fluid Mechan-
ics and Chill’.
Felix: Please make a
song called‘Panop-
to’, and we’ll make it
the Imperial anthem!
Are there any other
comments you have
about this experi-
ence, both discov-
ering it and then it
blowing up on social
media?
ZL: I really don’t care
– whether there are five
people or five hundred
people watching, it
doesn’t really change what
I’m doing. If it makes
them happy, yeah, go for
it – but I’m just doing my
thing, listening to my own
music, and dancing. And
I’ll still be dancing when
this is all over.
Union to Implement ‘Cashless’ Trial
The Union’s commercial venues – including the bars and the Union shops – will be trialling a card- and Yoyo-only
payment scheme in February
T
he Union has
a n n o u n c e d
plans to trial
‘ c a s h l e s s ’
payment at its venues
during the month of
February, with the po-
tential for the plan to
roll out permanently.
Since August 2017,
13% of Beit Bars’ income
was from cash, while 79%
was via debit or credit
is the effect on students
without bank accounts –
typically those arriving in
the UK for the first time at
the beginning of the year.
The Head of Com-
mercial Services did not
respond to request for
comment.
Typically, the Union
bars specifically take a lot
less cash during term-time
than during the summer
break and at the beginning
of term time. However,
there is a high variance –
within a given week, there
will be days where only
£10 of payments are with
cash, while on others the
figure can reach closer to
£600.
The DPFS commented
that it would be “useful to
know if the cash we take
is because its an option,
or because it's the only
option.” She further clar-
ified that student feedback
would be considered:
“knowing how students
feel about going cashless,
and the impact it had on
their experience with the
Union, can significantly
shape where we go
moving forward.”
The cashless move
extends behind the scenes
as well, with the Finance
directorate dispensing
with all petty cash -
meaning they cannot
reimburse small amounts.
This is reportedly in
order to stop the Union
incurring high transac-
tion processing fees, as
charges are calculated
per-transaction.
The DPFS has encour-
aged students to get in
contact at dpfs@imperial.
ac.uk in the run-up to the
trial.
card.
The idea was proposed
to the Union’s Leadership
Team by the Head of
Commercial Services,
Julia Mattingley, at the
end of last term. She cited
an improvement in effi-
ciency, reducing risk from
either theft or robbery, or
from mishandling of cash.
However, term ended
before the matter could be
fully discussed with other
members of the Leader-
ship Team, and due to the
need for marketing mate-
rials to inform students of
the change Commercial
Services made an “exec-
utive decision was made
to trial in February”,
according to the Deputy
President (Finance and
Services).
The change is also
intended to be a cost-sav-
ing exercise, removing the
necessity of processing
cash – however, the fine
details of this are still to be
discussed and explained.
Transactions by card incur
a fee for the vendor, and
so the cost-savings would
need to outweigh this
added expense.
