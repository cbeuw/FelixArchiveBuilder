T
he Royal Opera
House’s Madama
Butterfly is a
modern take on
the operatic classic
that showcases a
jaw-dropping performance
from Ermonela Jaho. Despite
this, the newest rendition
of Puccini’s ‘ode’ to Japan
doesn’t quite pack the punch
it needs to drag the piece out
of its orientalist past.
The production attempts to
separate the outdated writing
from the performance by cre-
ating a minimalist experience.
The set design and lighting
are phenomenal; minimalism
and subtlety come together to
create an homage to the Jap-
anese reverence for attention
to detail, precision, harmony,
and simplicity. Rice paper
Shoji (screen doors) form
the centrepiece of the stage,
slowly opening and closing,
reshaping the stage, repo-
sitioning characters from
the dark nights to fra-
grant spring gardens.
The lights create
soft gradients of
blues and oranges
which Cio-Cio-
San (Ermonela
Jaho), usually clad in white or
pale pastels, gracefully dips
in and out of.
The costumes, too, are
simple and elegant. It is this
simplicity that clashes with
the over-dramatisation of
some of the performances
(we get it, you’re a butterfly
– stop flapping your kimono
sleeves now please), causing
dissonance and drawing
attention to some of the more
problematic elements of
Puccini’s opera. The whiteness
of the cast is stressed by the
geisha get-ups that verge on
yellow-face.
The undercurrent of oriental-
ism really is a shame because
Jaho’s performance is in fact
quite beautiful. I lack the

expertise to judge her on her
technique but the American
couple behind me did say it
was one of the best perfor-
mances they’d ever seen (and
this was the third Madama
Butterfly they’d sat through)
while the reviewer next to
me, a man in his sixties or
seventies, burst into tears
not once but twice during
the performance (and even
I choked up towards the end
but I mean *SPOILER ALERT*
she is about to commit suicide
in front of her three year old
child and I’m not a monster)
– so hey.
The opera has not only
been written but is often
performed in a way that
intentionally or not, at times
feels like a parody of the
Japanese culture. The Royal
Opera needs to drag its inter-
petations out of irrelevance
if it is to attract a younger
audience, it is difficult to see
how Madama Butterfly
will stand the test of time
unless it is radically
re-approached,
starting with
with a cast that
reflects its our
current cultural
standing and
expectations.
