Are millennials
too entitled or do
we just deserve
better?
Tessa Davey thinks that millennial
entitlement is a good thing
T
he media is
obsessed with
millennials being
more entitled
than previous
g e n e r a t i o n s ,
what with all those years of
praise, encouragement, and
social media. It’s a great
rhetoric: we’re all narcissistic
nightmares, who are too
obsessed with our personal
brand and too lazy to put our
heads down and memorise
things that we could easily
Google.
Maybe we are more entitled,
but I don’t think that it’s a bad
thing. I don’t think millennials
have an expectation of having
things handed to us, but we are
instead more willing to fight for
things than generations before
us who weren’t so hell-bent on
changing the world.
I’ve been at Imperial for a
long time, and when I started
therewerestillstudentsfiltering
through the system who paid
only £1,000 of tuition fees
a year. I paid just over three
grand a year, and while I
will obviously be paying this
back for the next couple of
decades, I don’t think I got a
bad deal. The teaching might
not all have been great (some
may have been terrible) but
we just got on with it and
ultimately I graduated with
a very reputable Master’s
degree that certainly has
increased my lifetime earning
potential far more than the
student loan I’ve amassed.
But this was back in 2008,
and now higher education
is a lot more expensive for a
set of young people who are
far more socially aware and
informed than I ever was at
their age.
Of course, I’m part of
the generation that was
heartbroken by the Lib Dem
betrayal when tuition fees shot
up. With English degree debt
now the highest in the world,
the average student paying
£9,000 a year for university
can expect to owe more than
£44,000 by the time they
graduate. This increase made
much more of a difference
than the small and gradual
fee rises that crept up before.
\\ We are becoming
increasingly entitled because
we realise that if we want
to get anything we have to
demand it and fight for it \\
Although theoretically there
are more student loans,
bursaries, and there is more
support available now, paying
that much for university is a
big deal, and students are
expecting a lot more for their
money.
Thanks to a greater collective
awareness, post-£9000
students have mobilised,
demanding higher quality
teaching than the years of
students before them ever got.
They’re getting aggro at poor
feedback, suing universities
over inadequate supervision,
and generally throwing their
toys out of the pram about not
getting what they think they
deserve. Do you think that we
had the privilege of watching
Panopto lectures in bed while
annotating the conveniently
distributed course handouts
on our iPads? We had to show
up at 9am and copy down
notes from a blackboard while
trying not to choke on chalk
dust if we sat near the front.
We didn’t have guaranteed
feedback within two weeks,
and we had barely any contact
hours that didn’t consist of
sitting with 250 other people
in a lecture theatre, and we
didn’t complain.
But do you know what? We
were fucking stupid not to do
so. A lot of the poor teaching
we had was subpar to the
point of unacceptable, with
lecturers being prevented
from teaching after they’d
doomed a whole class to an
average exam mark that was
scaled up to 40% and an
often completely nonsensical
course structure.
Poor teaching isn’t the fault
of lecturers who don’t care
about students. It’s difficult
for teaching staff. I’ve seen
both sides and I get it.
Teaching staff are overworked
because, to oversimplify,
College prioritises research
over teaching. It brings in
more money, and it makes a
bigger impact on our global
reputation. But College
wouldn’t exist were it not for
the students, who have the
ability to lobby for change
as they effectively hold
College to ransom. There has
been so much development
and change in the teaching
standards at Imperial over the
last few years as more and
more students have become
entitled enough to ask for it,
but the quality of teaching is
still hugely variable.
I have so much admiration
for the students who came
after me who took control of
their education and fought for
better teaching. The ones who
are bothered to fill out SOLE
and tear any terrible teaching
to shreds; the ones who leave
feedback and ask for more
resources; the ones who have
stood up and lobbied College
to give them value for money;
they have absolutely earned
the better teaching that they
are getting (although of
\\ They’re getting
aggro at poor
feedback, suing
universities over
inadequate
supervision, and
generally throwing
their toys out of the
pram \\
course, there is still a long way
to go).
But at the same time, many
of the students who came
after me are little shits who
seem to be chronically unable
to check their emails and
reply appropriately like the
adults they are. For all their
internet literacy, they seem
to be too lazy to read the
handouts carefully or perform
a basic Google search before
running to teaching staff, or
to stop scrolling Instagram
to give their full attention to
a tutorial. You deserve of a
good education, but you are
not entitled to being spoon-fed
the answers, and university is
a step up from school where
you do have to manage
your own learning to some
extent. Having identified a
valid demand, some students
are regressing back into
schoolchildren, forgetting that
when you come to university
you have to at least pretend to
be a grownup and not waste
the time of those providing
your education.
Those who shit on millennials
are wrong – we aren’t entitled
because we’ve always been
handed things on a plate. We
are becoming increasingly
entitled because we realise
that if we want to get anything
we have to demand it and
fight for it, and the more
connected we all are, the
easier this becomes. Channel
your deserved entitlement into
fighting for a better education,
but don’t think that a better
education means that anyone
is going to do the work for
you.
