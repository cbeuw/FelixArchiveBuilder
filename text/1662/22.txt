I
’ll be honest that Jesus’
death break was so long
that I completely forgot that
I write in this spunk-rag of
a newspaper and the two
dualities that make up this
column must be awoken from
their slumber. In order to do this I
must utter the fateful words which
all felix writers utter before they
commit mirth and hilarity to page:
“Nobody reads this except our
parents, and people wanking
to the centrefold during exam
season”.
Listen up all you left-tards: in this
stressful time of exams just know
that there are plenty of people
who you went to school with who
dropped out after year twelve who
are earning more money than you,
own a car, probably happier, and
probably getting more sex than
you stuck in this shit hole. At least
you got two A*s in your A levels I
guess. Maybe if you privately-edu-
cated twats worked a day in your
life instead of worrying about
pronouns, you’d be somewhere by
now instead of doing a master’s
and becoming a banker-wanker
like the rest of Imperial.
But let’s talk Trump: although we
managed to get him to the White
House, the real battle is far from
over. I can’t believe how bad the
media is attacking papa orange
for the minor shortcomings over
the past 100 days. If they had pro-
hibited the women and the other
minorities of the ethnic variety
from working, then we wouldn’t
be in the current, wall-lacking
predicament we find ourselves in.
A wall is the only thing that will
keep our burrito-buddies south of
the border, as these Mexicans are
just so slippery from all that taco
grease, that any hole in the wall
will allow them to eel their way
into our country to rape, murder,
and worst of all, force us to learn
Spanish.
Closer to home we are being
forced to do the worst thing a
democratic government can ever
ask you to do: vote again. When
I heard that we were going to be
obligated to fuck up our country
for the second time in a year,
all I could do was groan and
half-heartedly bash one out to the
papier-mâché bust of Margaret
Thatcher in my kitchen. Perhaps
when Theresa May finally allows
the demon inside her to manifest
itself in physical form then MAYBE
we can hurry up to the deporting
of anyone who looks too dark
to be from these fair Isles. As for
me, I plan on deporting my Greek
editor as soon as possible. Maybe
then we can finally clear all the
smashed plates and get rid of the
stench of olives from the office and
actually get some work done.
I
am completely overjoyed, dear
readers, and it has nothing
to do with the hemp-infused
Easter eggs I’ve been inserting
into my rectum. We have
finally made actual progress in
defeating the rise of fascism. First
of all, this election: now the British
public has woken up to the lies
and deceit that was Brexit and the
Conservative party, we can finally
sort this shit out and great comrade
Corbyn can finally assume his
rightful place at 10 Kremlin street.
Once Jezza comes into power,
he will redistribute the wealth
(somehow) and by doing that he
will be able to afford all the things
he is promising to spend money
on despite having no plan. By the
looks of Jeremy’s snapchat he is
hard at work speaking to his key
electorate that are unconvinced:
babies. Sure, perhaps they won’t
sway the election in quite the
way we would hope, but Jeremy
is playing the long game, way
into the future when the Labour
party has disintegrated under his
misguided idealism. I’m sure he’ll
make Freddos cheaper as well.
Then there’s Trump: first 100 days
in office were a complete failure
so we can impeach him basically
and if Hillary isn’t busy giving
talks to Wall Street, I’m sure she
could move into his place almost
immediately. We would finally
have a female president, although
the main work for her would be
to make sure everyone uses the
right suffixes and pronouns when
addressing the presidentress.
After that, perhaps she can spend
some time repairing relationships
with North Korea but, you know,
priorities. It also seems as though
this wall fantasy Agent Orange
had envisioned is dead in the
water and nothing is to come of
it. Frankly this is good because I
just feel like (if I may first check my
privilege) the noble Latin people
just make the best burritos. I think
that mother Gaia blessed them
with the right size fingers to wrap
seitan slices in a gluten-free wrap.
Also they do bring the best ganja
this side of Jamaica (Jah Rastafah).
The next couple of months will
be long and turbulent for all you
exam-takers, but just remember
that a piece of paper can never
truly define who you are as a
person. Unless that piece of
paper is instructing you to stay
500 metres away from schools
at all times, then you’re probably
defined as a paedo.
Things are looking up
boi
Jonathan Masters is finally
optimistic about the the state of
the world... kind of
We’re only 100
days in but things
are looking
goooood
Monathan Jasters talks
contingency plans for in case the
left takes over.
