pril saw
felix getting
shortlisted for
four Student
Publication
Association
Awards last month, with Editor
Lef Apostolakis and Comment
Editor/Millennials Queen/felix
Vice Chair/Office Legend
Tessa Davey each garnering
two nominations. Another
member of the felix team
received a nomination for
work with the London Student
which is totally fine and in no
way awkward.
Apostolakis was shortlisted
for Best Reporter and Best
News Story. The latter was for
an article surrounding consent
training at Imperial which was
published back in November.
Davey was recognised in the
categories of Best Feature
and Best Comment for ‘Drunk
Consent Is Not Consent’ and
‘ImperialGirlsCanDoWithout
Sport Imperial‘ respectively.
The SPA Awards have
largely taken over from the
Guardian Student Media
Awards which appear to
have come to an end due to
financial concerns. felix won
the Guardian Student Media
Publication of the Year in
both 2006 and 2008 but has
yet to find success at the SPA
Awards.
The judges for the awards
are a selection of industry
SPAawardsshortlistannounced
felix nominated for four student journalism awards
Matt Johnston
experts including editors and
writers from The Telegraph,
Metro, The Times, The i, and
Buzzfeed.
Davey was overjoyed at
the nominations, “Both of
my articles that have been
shortlisted are on topics that
I’m really passionate about.
I’ve worked really hard over
the last few years at felix to
develop my writing to the
point that I feel like I can do
justice to important topics such
as consent and feminism, and
I’m really excited and proud
to have this recognised by the
SPA.”
Apostolakis, who has been
accused of “gutter journalism”,
finds the nominations
reafirming. “It’s great to
see that we’re on the same
level as other major student
publications.” Considering
Imperial lacks not just
journalism degrees but even
any real arts or humanities
degrees the standard of the
paper is impressive. “I’m just
hoping this will be enough to
guarantee the future of the
paper for at least a little bit
longer”
The awards ceremony forms
part of the Student Publication
Association National
Conference (SPANC for short)
that takes place this weekend,
which will all be live tweeted
via @feliximperial. Probably.
Mascotry
saga draws
to an end
I
t only took about a year
but the ‘heated’ topic of
mascotry conduct seems
to have finally been put
to rest. Sort of. During the
final council meeting of
the spring term, the reworked
mascotry paper was almost
successfully passed. Almost,
because following a mass
exodus after the presentation
of the tie club paper, Council
was no longer quorate.
After a series of back and
forths the constituent unions
came to an agreement as
to how mascotry is to be
regulated.
Key changes include the
valuation of the mascots
for insurance purposes, the
creation of an updated set
of rules and the awarding of
all seeing god and ultimately
referee status to the Union
president in case constituent
unions can’t play nice.
Additionally a series of
‘demands’ (aka the ransom
necessary to return a stolen
mascot) and practices have
been banned.
These include:
A. Demands that would bring
shame to any one particular
mascotry fan or a constituent
union
B. Illegal shit (yes we thought
it was intuitive too. Yes this
took months to sort out).
C. Returning mascots late
(really that’s just rude).
These riveting changes
should take effect as soon
as an email vote has been
completed.
But it’s looking up for
mascotry. We can finally stop
boring everyone and move on
with our lives.
JK there’s totally going to be
one last update on this.
