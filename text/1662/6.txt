This recognition will
strengthen the ties of Imperial
researchers to the national
security programme. For the
past five years for example,
research at Imperial has
looked into securing the UK’s
critical infrastructure such
as the railway system from
hacking.
Imperial is also part of
PETRAS, a consortium
exploring our relationship
to the Internet of Things (the
wonderful integrations of the
internet to our everyday lives
that allow us to perform all
sorts of tasks, from linking our
home heating to our phone to
linking our bedside light to the
International Space Station).
The consortium has currently

Easterbreak,
Imperial has
shockingly
managed to
bag not one
but two distinctions leaving
students to wonder whether
this was an April Fool’s joke.
First IC won the Student
Experience prize at the
Guardian University Awards
2017 and shortly after, it got
recognised as a centre of
excellence in cyber security
research.
Starting with the Student
Experience prize, the
Guardian University Awards
recognised Imperial’s initiative
to prioritise mental wellbeing
of its postgraduate students.
The ‘Researching Well
Together’ initiative comprises
of a writing retreat and a
coaching programme for
students as well as an online
course for supervisors.
Meanwhile, Imperial has
shared this work with a variety
of institution across the globe
to raise awareness in the
sector.
Asforthesecondrecognition,
it was given by the National
Cyber Security Centre
(NCSC), the UK’s authority on
cyber security. The excellence
of cyber security research
that occurs at Imperial was
first recognised in 2012, and
at the time it was one of the
first institutions to receive such
status.

received £9.8 million so far
fromt the Engineering and
Physical Sciences Research
Council (EPSRC) and is set to
receive another £13.2 million.
These distinctions come
at a precarious time for UK
Universities. With the results
of the teaching excellence
framework to be announced
by early June and bronze
silver and gold ratings to be
given to higher education
institutions causing a cascade
of effects, any distinction
counts.
Vice Provost for Education
Simone Buitendijk was pleased
to see the Imperial get these
distinctions. “Achievements
like the Guardian University
Award for Student Experience
are only possible due to
the strength of our research
and quality of our teaching.
As we move forward with
our new Learning and
Teaching Strategy, it is these
achievements that we will look
to build on as we continue
to enhance the educational
experience across the
College”
Will recognition affect the TEF ratings this June?

Homeless Period hits Imperial
I
CU has opened a branch
of The Homeless Period,
an initiative lobbying
government to provide
a yearly allowance to
homeless shelters for the
provision of female hygiene
products to shelter seekers.
The founders of the initiative
believe that just as access
to condoms and razors is
facilitated for men by these
institutions, access to clean
clothes as a result of access
to female hygiene products
should not be a luxury.
The initiative launched its
first Homeless Period Imperial
week last May, calling at
students to collect as many
sanitary items as possible for
donation to Spires, a homeless
shelter in Lambeth, South
London.
Altogether during Homeless
Period Imperial week, 734
sanitary pads, 686 tampons
and £700 were donated to
Spires.
A prize was awarded to the
person who collected and
donated the most tampons
and sanitary towels by the
end of the week as well as
for the person who shares the
Lef Apostolakis
most photos of men buying
sanitary items to the Homeless
Period Imperial Facebook
page to help break the stigma
associated with men buying
female hygiene products.

as
Andriopoulos
ICU President
publicly
endorsed Tom
Harwood
for NUS President. The
endorsement was given
despite the fact that Imperial
College Union is not part
of the NUS but also despite
Andriopoulos’ track record of
avoiding any discussion of his
political leanings, particularly
his stance on Brexit. “As
I have said on previous
occasions, no member should
be compelled to declare their
private political beliefs or past
votes as a public record.”
Though it’s unclear where that
leaves students involved in
student politics
Earlier last year Durham
SU President Harwood ran a
satirical campaign for NUS
delegate which included gems
such as using “NUS boycotts
to destroy ISIS” and bringing
down the government by
means of “violent revolution.”
He also ran the Students For
Britain campaign during the
EU referendum, encouraging
students to vote for Brexit.
This year he ran for NUS
president, with a campaign set
against all the “silly things” the
NUS has been up to over the
years. Ultimately Harwood
suffered a crushing defeat at
the hands of Shakira Martin.
When confronted on Twitter
Andriopoulos said: “Students
need to have credibility in
the eyes of the media and the
government. Otherwise it is
all too easy to give students a
raw deal”.
