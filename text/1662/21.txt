SEX
It’s not my job to please your girlfriend
I
don’t like being cheated
on. You probably don’t
either. In fact I’d go so far
as to say that no one likes
being cheated on. Unless
you’re into cuckolding but
that’s a whole other story.
Last time I got cheated on
it made me feel betrayed
and angry not only at my
partner, but also at the other
person that had participated
in the backstabbing that is
cheating. At the same time I
have both unknowingly and
knowingly slept with someone
who was in a monogamous
relationship, so my being
angry is hypocritical at best,
and completely illogical at
worst. So... is being the ‘other
woman’ ok?
Let’s try a mental experi-
ment. You’re in Metric with
your buds. The alcohol is flow-
ing, and you’re vibing with
take them home. That is until
some busybody butts in and
coughs out a “taken” leading
you into an existential crisis
centered around a single
question: Do you still fuck
them?
A lot of what you do comes
down to social obligation,
and whether it’s a worthwhile
trade-off for the hassle and
aggro that it’s gonna incur.
Or, some might say, a ques-
tion of morals. But does this
bit of information – info that
you didn’t ask for and that
the person you want to bang
everyone you’re flirting with
if they are taken? Or do you
slip in the question just as you
request the Uber? Is it too late
to ask when the clothes are
coming off? What about just
before you climax? Is it up
to them to police their own
behaviour and make their
own decisions?
These are all valid ques-
tions. On the one hand, to
give informed consent, you
need to be aware of the situa-
tion enough to justifiably call
yourself informed. But is their
relationship status a relevant
with them or their partner.
Then you almost contractually
have social obligations to
them which probably include
not screwing with them and
their partner. But if you’re not
friends with them, is it any of
your business? Why should
you go out of your way to
enforce something for this
person who is insignificant
in your life at the expense
of your own pleasure; is
someone else’s monogamy
yours to enforce? If you think
you should be preventing
cheating, where do you draw
the line? You’ve established
us. In our family-value society
cheating equals failure. Our
anger is a result of us trying
to cope with society question-
ing our value as a partner.
Were we not enough for
them? Did we do something
wrong? It’s the feelings of
betrayal and inadequacy that
are the kicker, rather than
legitimate anger that two
people meaninglessly rubbed
their genitals together. I’m
not saying you shouldn’t be
angry – a deal is a deal. If I
had been promised a two for
one lobster dinner and had
to pay full price at the end of
my meal, I’d be pretty fucking
pissed.
BUT the priority should be
anger at the person who
has betrayed us, rather than
projecting betrayal onto
someone who really had no
vested interest in us. If I can
justify feeling guiltless when
I sleep with someone who is
supposedly in an exclusive
relationship, I should be self-
aware enough to recognise
that I’m not actually angry at
someone who does the same
thing.
It’s the responsibility of the
people in a relationship, and
no one else, to be respectful
of their partners, whether that
means being honest or being
faithful or paying rent or
keeping the toilet seat down.
If they’re a cheater, they’re
a cheater, and nothing you
do makes a blind bit of differ-
ence to their relationship.
So now put yourself back in
Metric with this hottie. What
do you do?
\\ I have
unknowingly and
knowingly slept
with someone
who was in a
relationship, so
my being angry is
hypocritical at
best \\
someone’s highschool friend.
You haven’t met before, you
know very little about them
but what you do know is
that they’re hitting on you,
and you’re getting ready to
didn’t volunteer – actually
change anything? And more
importantly, should it?
Regardless of the complex-
ities of their relationship and
the trustworthiness of the
party-pooping source, sup-
pose you found out that they
weren’t single the morning
after instead. Should you
have known? Should you
have asked them and if so
when? Is it necessary to ask
detail? Just as you don’t need
to know their brother’s name
or the town they grew up in,
or quite frankly their name,
do you really need to know
that they’re taking a night off
from going steady with that
chick they met in the library?
Policing the sexual exclusiv-
ity of everyone who crosses
your path can’t be your
responsibility.
It’s different if you’re friends
There’s nothing wrong with being the other woman
\\ You’ve
established they’re a
scumbag: if they’re
not fucking you,
they’ll be fucking
someone else \\
they’re a scumbag: if they’re
not fucking you, they’ll be
fucking someone else. Just
hitting on someone is just as
much of a betrayal as actu-
ally going through with the
act. Regardless of whether
shagging them makes their
relationship less/more fucked
up and dishonest.
So why the fuck do we
demonise the other woman?
The thing is, when we’re
angry at the people who
sleep with our partners, we’re
just displacing our anger at
the person who’s betrayed
So yeah. I’m married. But like we have an agreement. // Paula Satijn
