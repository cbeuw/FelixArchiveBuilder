CANCER
VIRGO
This week you’re
going through a
mid-twenties crisis.
You bought a twenty
pack of tube socks,
made an Avril Lavigne
playlist and picked up
skating.
LEO
PISCES
AQUARIUS
SAGITTARIUS
SCORPIO
LIBRA
GEMINI
TAURUS
ARIES
This week you’re
surprised by how thin
you’ve got. You are
felix from now until
the end of the summer
term.
This week you’re the
felix editorial team and
you’ve abandoned
ship.
This week you’re
Theresa May’s hair.
After your little
performance at the
General Election
announcement, you’ve
finally gotten a break
and a one-hairpiece
show in the West End.
Dreams do come true.
This week you are
gagging for a stranger
to do you. You’re quick
and easy. You’re the
felix sex survey:

This week you’re
Jayden Smith’s hair at
the Met Gala. A poor
substitute for a date
and/or handbag.
This week you’re an
overpriced graduation hat.
You’re flat, you’re square
and you’ll only be worn
once, begrudgingly by a
tired-ass postgrad.
This week you’re
the June 18th
General
Election and you’re sick
of being influenced by
the bloody Europeans.
Who do they they think
they are anyway?
The founders of
democracy?
This week you’re
that condom from the
freshers’ pack. It’s been
three years since you
last saw the light of day
briefly. You’re about to
expire but you still have
hope for Timmy. You
can do it boi.
This week you’re
Grexit and you’ve had
it with Brexit constantly
hogging the spotlight.
You were here first!
This week you’re Prince
Charles. You’re a little bit
like Schroedinger’s cat.
Are you dead? Are you
alive? Who knows!
This week you’re Katy
Perry at the Met Gala.
What the fuck Katy.
What’s with the side
mirrors and why wasn’t
there a rear view
mirror too?
CAPRICORN
CRISIS
Chris
Dear Chris,
The Summer term has literally only just begun and I’ve
already screwed up majorly. You know how you’re meant to
work/revise/prepare/whatever during Easter break? I have
done absolutely none of that. I didn’t even travel or try pick-
ing up a foreign language.
Frankly I don’t know what the fuck I did all April. But shit
has hit the fan and fuck me I’ve literally been back at Imperial
for two days and I’m already dying.
I need to mitigate my complete uselessness.
Advice?
Best,
Louise-Emily Fenton
Dear L,
It happens every time. You know haw many
Easter breaks I’ve been through? I’d tell you
but you didn’t ask and even if you had it
would’ve been rude so let’s just say several.
Every year you’re given a month to relax and
everyone freaks out and does placements, or
revision, or ‘independent study’.
That’s not why you’re given time off. It’s to
eat pizza in your underwear while watching
re-runs of Gossip Girl and stealing your house-
mates’ medicinal cannabis butter.
It’s to lose a week of your life in some random
guy’s basement in Bayswater, high off your
face, only to emerge pale, lubed up and with
a major comedown two hours before the start
HOROSCOPES
of term.
It’s to fall in love with a tall dark stranger, or a
short pale friend only to realise the sex is crap
and that you can do it twice as good on your
own.
It’s just no one seems to have gotten the
memo so everyone returns from the break
oveworked, super-prepared and with a couple
extra lines added to their CV.
It’s these douchebags that ruin it for the rest of
us.
So yes. That’s my advice. Blame others for
your shortcomings. You good babe.
Big luv,
Chris xxxx
