The West's
little nuclear
problem
Charles Titmuss thinks that North Korea
hold all the cards in the little game of
nuclear war
I
n the last month, relations
between North Korea
and the rest of the world
have soured, due to a
series of missile launches.
North Korea is one of the
world’s most secretive and
oppressive states, and has
harboured nuclear ambitions
for a long time. Its complex
relationship with the rest of
the world can be put down to
its history and the governing
Kim dynasty.
North and South Korea
were founded in the confused
aftermath of the Japanese
surrender in 1945. The Soviet
and US armies occupied the
country up to the 38th
parallel
northandbeganadministering
the two zones separately.
Although there were plans for
an eventual reunification of
the whole peninsula, the onset
of the Cold War prevented
this. Therefore in 1948 two
separate states were set
up: North Korea under the
leadership of Kim Il-Sung and

adopt the MAD
doctrine, and thus
render themselves
invulnerable to
enemy attacks \\
South Korea under Syngman
Rhee. Both states were
supported by the relevant
ideological superpowers, the
North by communist China
and the Soviet Union and the
South by the US and NATO.
Both states had the desire
for a reunified Korea, and
in 1950 the North decided
that a military invasion of the
South would achieve this.
The war ended in 1953, with
both sides more or less back
at their starting positions, but
never officially made peace,
contributing to the climate
of suspicion and barely
contained aggression that
continues to the present day.
In 2012, a new ruler, Kim
Jong-Un, ascended to the
throne as the newest dictator.
Since then North Korea has
been increasing frequency
and brazenness with which it
carries out both missile tests
and nuclear detonations, with
the goal being that of nuclear
weapons that can hit America.
To put this in a strategic
context, the ultimate aim of
the North is the reunification
of Korea and the total security
of the state. In order to do
that, it will need to conquer
the South while in turn
being immune from foreign
aggression. It cannot muster
overwhelming force militarily
when compared to the forces
of its potential enemies, nor
can it rely on past allies such
as China to supplement its
military strength.
By adopting nuclear
weapons capable of striking
their enemies, they are able
to adopt the MAD doctrine,
and thus render themselves
invulnerable to enemy attacks
unless those enemies want to
go nuclear. Nuclear weapons
would also enable the North
to threaten other states with
a nuclear strike in order to
obtain economic or territorial
concessions, for example
removing trade restrictions, or
surrendering South Korea in its
entirety to the North. Overall,
the prospect of a nuclear
armed North is bleak and
terrifying for its opponents,
leaving no checks or balances
on the regime.
Therefore, what can be done
about North Korea? Currently
the approach is the “soft”
method, embargoes on the
regime. This has impacted the
North Korean economy by
denying it access to Western
markets, but it remains
functional mainly due to the
support of China.
China is an ally of the North,
having fought unofficially
beside it in the Korean war.
Trade with China accounts for
83% of the North’s exports
and 85% of its imports
(OECD data), giving China
a considerable amount of
economic influence. Although
China is showing signs of
impatience with its nuclear
ambitions – it refused a
shipment of coal from the
North recently – it is unwilling
to halt trade completely
and collapse the country’s
economy entirely. Therefore,
sanctions remain ineffective.
Another option that is
currently under consideration
is a military invasion of the
peninsula. This would be
costly, and it is doubtful that
there is the political will for
such a sacrifice. There is also
the fact that North Korea
have a considerable amount
of heavy artillery aimed at
the South Korean capital of
Seoul at all times, capable of
reducing it to rubble. Russia
and China would also be
reluctant to sanction such
an engagement as it would
alter the strategic balance
of the region, placing US
troops right on their border.
The recent deployment of a
THAAD anti-missile system met
considerable opposition from
both countries, so imagine
the objection if the whole of
NATO turned up at the 38th
parallel.
A third option is turning
Pyonyang into radioactive
rubble, but this is even more
unlikely than a land invasion.
No one wants to cremate
Korea quite yet.
Essentially, North Korea has
all the cards. China is unwilling
to risk destabilising North
Korea or allowing a greater
amount of US influence in
the region by a strengthened
South Korea. This protects
North Korea from the effects of
Western sanctions. War is not
viable due to reluctance from
the West and the influence of
Russia and China.
North Korea will continue to
develop its nuclear weapons in
relative peace, until it is ready
to use them. Dialogue with the
regime will be critical in order
to attempt to make it more
open and less fond of nuking
the world to a nice radioactive
orange.Thisdialoguewillhave
to come from both China and
the US if it there is any chance
of North Korea not possessing
the ability to destabilise the
Korean peninsula and the
wider far east.
