Serving up Spring
Isn’t everything so much better when it has a
Spring vibe, when it’s all fresh? felix is delving
into the freshest taglaitelle you can cook
I
was leaving college one
evening after a long, dreary
day huddled inside the
dark warmth of ACEX (on
top of some never-ending
coursework), when I looked up
to the sky, preparing for a deep,
long sigh, as per any typical cold
winter day. The sigh dissipated
into thin air as the navy blue
was replaced by a cloudless,
cornflower blue. A few wisps of
coral-coloured cotton candy clouds
drifted past. It was 6pm and it was
bright outside.
A white, delicate petal from a
plum blossom tree flew with the
light breeze, swirling around in
mid-air like a fairy. It wasn’t ‘till
then when I realized that it was
no longer winter anymore. South
Kensington had awakened from
its hibernation and blossomed into
spring.
I always believed that our palette
changes with the seasons, so it’s
time for a refreshing change! This
prawn, lemon and asparagus
tagliatelle is the perfect dish to
celebrate those breezy, sunny
afternoons, or a fix for those grey
drizzly days. The lemon brightens
up anyone’s mood while the dash
of cream embraces all the flavours
together.
Ingredients (two servings):
Juice of 1 lemon (plus some peel and a
few slices for garnishing)
110g fine asparagus, chopped into
1-inch long sections
250g of prawns
2 cloves of garlic, minced
A pinch of crushed chilli, salt and
pepper
100ml double cream
250g tagliatelle, linguine or spaghetti
Method
Cook your pasta according to the
instructions on the packet, drain.
Meanwhile, heat up some olive
oil in a big pan, pan-fry the
prawns until slightly pink. Remove
and set aside.
Sauté the asparagus, add the
minced garlic and crushed chilli
Add a dash of pasta water, allow
to simmer for 2 minutes on low
heat.
Add the prawns and the cream,
grated lemon peel and the lemon
juice.
Stir and allow to bubble gently.
Stir in the pasta, season with salt
and pepper.
Enjoy!

I
hope you’ve enjoyed hunting
for Easter chocolate eggs and
that you don’t feel sorry for
not letting your younger sister
get more than two. Good job,
by the way. But now that you
are out of your sugar coma, it’s
time to start wondering what you
are supposed to do with all those
kilos of chocolate you’ve acquired
over the past month. I’m not saying
that you can’t just eat them – God,
forbid! – but maybe it’s time to
feel like a decent human again. At
least for a little bit.
Ingredients:
300g chocolate
Salt
300 ml double cream
100 g sugar
Amaretto (to taste, but remember that
you are trying to make mousse, not
get drunk)
1 tbsp (good quality) cocoa powder
First, smash up the chocolate into
relatively small pieces – yes, it’s
time to unleash all the anger you
have inside on the poor choco-
late. Afterwards, simply melt it in
bain-marie (do I have to explain
this to you?). Actually, just go for
students’ best friend: melt carefully
in the microwave. Depending on
your skill in the kitchen, you might
want to add a little bit of butter,
but this is not necessary.
Mix the double cream and the
sugar in a separate bowl. Add
the salt and the cocoa powder.
When well-mixed, add the melted
chocolate and keep mixing. This is
the moment when you should taste
it and make sure it does not need
any finishing touches. You are still
allowed to add extra sugar or a
pinch of salt. It’s really hard to give
directions when you are using a
chocolate mix – assuming that you
are using the Easter leftovers and
not some baking chocolate chips.
Finally, add some good old
Amaretto. Up to taste, really. But
you should also keep an eye on
the consistency as you don’t want
it to go liquid on you. Pour it in a
fancy cup and decorate with nuts,
pistachios or anything else you
fancy (I normally go for the nut
and strawberries variety). Let it
sit in the fridge for at least three
hours – it depends on the size of
the serving. Consume!
Time to get rid of all that chocolate you
couldn’t finish and have been hoarding all
Easter? Want to eat it but finding yourself
at the verge of bursting? felix has found the
perfect solution for you!
