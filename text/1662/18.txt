marketing ploy.
On Portland, Drake links up
with Quavo and Travis Scott
(who are rumoured to have a
joint album coming soon) to
rap about their success and
originality. The track features
a catchy flute sample, which
trailblazer. It also makes the
hook to Portland, where we
hear Quavo sing, “Hell nah,
never let a nigga ride your
wave” all the more ironic,
when it could be argued that
Drake has ridden waves in
the past. Even the penulti-
mate track, Ice Melts, sounds
slightly similar to Broccoli
by D.R.A.M. (who claimed
Drake “jacked” his song
Cha Cha for his 2015 hit
Hotline Bling). It raises the
question, when does drawing
inspiration from something
simply become imitation and
is Drake’s music guilty of
the latter? The saying goes
“imitation is the sincerest form
of flattery”, but this is not the
case in the competitive world
of hip-hop. I would argue
that Drake doesn’t overtly
ride waves, he simply keeps
in touch with popular trends
and positions himself in such
a way to ensure his music
always remains relevant, a
necessary skill and something
he does better than any other
artist.
Once I overcame my initial
hope that, by delivering a
playlist instead of an album,
Drake would treat us to some-
thing completely different and
unexpected, I was able to
enjoy More Life for what it is:
a stellar, albeit typical Drake
project. As he’s done on pre-
vious albums, Drake uses the
final track, Do Not Disturb, to
unload, letting fans hear him
at his most pensive and vul-
nerable. He raps
“Last verse I
gotta do is
always like surgery / Always
tryin’ to let go of anything
that’ll burden me / That’s the
reason you can feel the ten-
sion and the urgency” before
proceeding to fire some
thinly veiled disses at fellow
Toronto rapper Tory Lanez:
“Last chance I get to make
sure you take it personally
/ Take this shit to heart, it’s
always executed perfectly /
If we do a song it’s like takin’
my kids to work with me /
You overnight celebrity, you
one day star / Swear I told
you that I’m in this bitch for
eternity / I am a reflection of
all your insecurities / Behind
closed doors, a lot of 6 god
worshipping / Done talk
now, ‘cause there’s other shit
that’s concernin’ me”. These
are Drake’s most direct shots
at Tory Lanez (whose real
name is Daystar Peterson
and whose debut album is
titled I Told You) since his
“New Toronto” reference
on 2016’s Summer Sixteen.
This is typical of Drake in
the sense that, throughout
More Life, he sticks to familiar
material, namely pensive
musings about his relation-
ships, success and his rivals
(on Gyalchester, he spits “I
know I said top five, but I’m
top two / And I’m not two
and I got one / Thought you
of his career on Sacrifices (as
a Young Thug fan, I’m weirdly
proud of him for coming from
mumble rap at its finest to
actually speaking English –
or as he calls it “Talkin’ neat
like a geek” – on a verse).
2 Chainz is also featured on
that track and the man simply
hasn’t missed the mark with a
feature in like 6 years. We’re
not bored of this Drake for-
mula for success yet but will
we soon tire of it? Artists like
Kanye West are constantly
pushing the boundaries by
regularly reinventing their
sound and surprising fans
with a fresh approach to their
craft and I believe that, for
his music and artistry to reach
new heights, Drake needs to
artistically challenge himself
more.
After countless listens, I
still don’t really know the
difference between a playlist
and an album. Perhaps, by
dubbing it a ‘playlist’, Drake
meant More Life would lack
the cohesion or clear theme/
genre of an album. Instead,
he delivers a real blend
of genres, with Jamaican,
London and Toronto Drake
all co-existing in beautiful
harmony on this project. In
many respects, More Life
succeeds where his previous
offering, the solid but some-
what underwhelming Views
failed. Although it is 2 tracks
longer than Views, More
Life doesn’t feel excessive
and better manages to grip
listeners from beginning to
end. Despite the fact One
Dance is an absolute tune, it
\\ I can’t tell if

seems to be the key to
making a hit hip-hop record
these days (Future’s Mask
Off, 21 Savage’s X and
Kodak Black’s Tunnel Vision
all feature flutes in their
production) – the flute is just
hot right now. Quavo and
Travis together on a track is
also a recipe for success –
the duo simply does not miss.
Quavo + Travis + flute = fire!
The track’s title is seemingly
a reference to the Portland
Trail Blazers basketball
team, suggesting that Drake,
Quavo and Travis consider
themselves trailblazers in hip-
hop culture. However, with all
the controversy surrounding
More Life and many pointing
out that Drake’s flow on KMT
sounds suspiciously similar to
upcoming rapper XXXtenta-
cion’s on his single Look At
Me, it is ironic that
Drake calls
himself a

had one, but it’s not one,
nigga, nah”, reminding us
of his success and further
asserting his superiority over
his rivals in the genre). For
almost a decade, Drake has
been rapping about what it’s
like to be Drake, taking us
through the ups and downs of
life as the 6 God and we’re
still all ears. Drake is just that
guy. It’s the reason I cringe
whenever he does his London
accent yet I still listen to every
track he drops. He even
managed to get Young Thug
to spit the most eloquent verse

could be argued that it lacked
originality and was simply a
rehashing of Kyla’s 2008 UK
Funky house anthem, Do You
Mind. In contrast, on More
Life, Drake better tows the fine
line between appreciation
and appropriation, ultimately
succeeding in paying homage
to his numerous musical
influences. Since his magnum
opus, 2011’s Take Care, I’ve
been waiting for Drake to pro-
duce a cohesive body of work
which matches its quality and
subsequently has a similar
seismic impact on the culture.
He previously came close
with 2015’s If You’re Reading
This It’s Too Late and, in my
opinion, More Life also comes
very close and deserves a
seat up there with some of
the best work of his stellar
discography.
