More Life
by Drake
rapper Giggs on the playlist.
After the hyped start to
More Life, Drake switches
up the vibe with the smooth,
summery, R&B ballad, Pas-
sionfruit, a track which sees
him detail the difficulties of
long-distance relationships.
Drake delving into his feelings
is, of course, not unheard
of and More Life is full of
emotional tracks where we
hear him croon about his trou-
bled love life. To name but a
few, Nothings Into Some-
things (where we hear him
reveal the tension that exists
between himself and an ex
– thought to be Serena Wil-
liams – who is now engaged),
Lose You (where we hear
him bemoaning the fact that
his commitment to rap has
caused distance from family,
friends and lovers) and Since
Way Back (where we hear
him link up with PARTYNEXT-
DOOR). I would argue 808s
& Heartbreak by Kanye West
was the first successful emo-
tional rap album, but Drake
has since turned ‘emo rap’
into his own niche on which
he’s been able to build the
foundation of his career and,
in turn, influence countless
artists. In a genre in which
hyper-masculinity is the norm,
he’s made it acceptable for
rappers to show vulnerability
and emotion through their
music. Lyrics like “I just take
the dreams I’ve been sold and
sell ‘em for more” on Glow
(the Kanye-assisted track
where they rap about how far
they’ve come in the industry
and how they’re going to
continue to shine, or ‘glow’,
for years to come), “Out of
body / that’s just how I feel
when I’m around you shawty”
on Teenage Fever (an R&B
ballad which samples Jennifer
Lopez’s classic If You Had My
Love) and “Everything these
days is textual / I just want
to get a lil’ sexual with you”
on Since Way Back sound
like ready-made Instagram
captions and make me want
to text exes I don’t even have.
Somehow, Drake has made
being moist cool and he con-
tinues to exploit this to great
effect throughout this project.
Drake’s recent obsession
with UK urban culture and its
subsequent influence on his
music is evident throughout
A
fter countless
delays
(something
which is
seemingly
becoming
an unfortunate feature of all
Drake releases these days),
More Life was finally released
on 18th
March. My excitement
was palpable to say the
least. In my opinion, Drake’s
work often falls victim to his
own procrastination and
hype, raising expectations
to unattainable heights and,
before even listening to his
latest offering, I already
had countless questions:
Will it live up to the massive
expectations? Who or what
is this mysterious ‘October
Firm’? What makes this
release a playlist, not an
album? More Life is a
gargantuan 22 tracks long so
there’s a lot to unpack. Let’s
get into it.
Drake kicks off More Life
with Free Smoke, a hype
track whose intro is a sample
of Nai Palm’s soulful voice
from Hiatus Kaiyote’s track,
Building a Ladder. After this
smooth intro, we hear “And
more chune for your headtop,
so watch how you speak
on my name you know”, a
soundbite of Drake’s ominous
message for his competitors
from his acceptance speech at
the American Music Awards.
Drizzy then launches into
straight bars, using the rest of
the track to proclaim his dom-
inance over the rap game
and even sneaking in a few
more shots at Meek Mill in the
process (“How you let the kid
this project. UK singer-song-
writer Jorja Smith has a
track named after her (Jorja
Interlude), and we hear her
silky vocals take centre stage
on Get it Together. There’s
also the hauntingly beautiful
4422 sung entirely by UK
singer Sampha (whose debut
album, Process, bangs by
the way) and Grime king
Skepta spits some venomous
bars on Skepta’s Interlude.
Promising young South
London rapper Dave (whose
track Wanna Know got the
‘6 God remix’ treatment) can
even be heard talking on
the outro of Teenage Fever.
We were told in advance by
Nineteen85, producer and
member of OVO R&B duo
dvsn, that Drake would use
Controlla and I suspect that
this new Jamaican Drake
is here to stay. Drake can
easily adapt to make any
genre his own (just listen to
his guest verse on his recent
collaboration with Wizkid,
Come Closer), and his ability
to try his hand at new genres
yet simultaneously keep it
quintessentially Drake is a tes-
tament to his versatility as an
artist. Having said that, Drake
needs to be careful that, by
dabbling in all these different
genres, he doesn’t become a
‘jack of all trades but master
of none’ parody of himself.
Drake is often criticised for
being a ‘culture vulture’ –
someone that jumps on the
wave, exploiting whatever
craze is popping in rap for
as long as it’s popular before
moving on to the next fad-
and, although I think labelling
him a ‘culture vulture’ label is
harsh, I do think that Aubrey
is a bit of a beg, to put it
bluntly. Although receiving a
co-sign from the 6 god can
seem like a dream come true
for an artist, this seemingly
selfless act of ‘putting an artist
on’ has actually proved to be
self-serving on Drake’s part,
with artists like iLoveMakon-
nen falling foul of the 6 God
co-sign curse in the past.
This makes me even more
sceptical about his bizarre
obsession with UK culture.
It was recently revealed
that Drake has bought the
rights to and will be starring
in season 3 of Top Boy, the
gritty Channel 4 drama
about London gangs. He’s
also apparently opening an
OVO store, the first of its kind
worldwide, in London. With
Drake, we know that, in order
to remain at the summit of hip-
hop, every move has to be
meticulously calculated and
I can’t tell if Drake’s recent
infatuation with London is
genuine love or all just a
More Life to “introduce new
music and new artists to the
rest of the world”. Drizzy
clearly felt the need to shine
light and show love to the
Grime & UK music scene as
a whole, hence the strong
UK presence on the playlist.
However, this tactic may
have backfired on Drake,
with many American fans
taking to Twitter to complain
about the amount of Grime
influence on the album. Giggs
in particular has received a
lot of backlash online from
American fans who simply
don’t understand why lyrics
like “And you already know I
love them breasts, lookin’ all
perky” and “Batman, da-na-
na-da-na” on KMT get us UK
fans so gassed.
On More Life, Drake also
shows his appreciation for the
Caribbean influence that has
become such a staple part of
his recent music and success,
with the ‘Jamaican Drake’
that we were introduced to

turned ‘emo rap’

high-energy start continues
with the thumping 808s of
