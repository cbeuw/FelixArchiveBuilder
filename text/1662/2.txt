We’reback.Pitches?
Y
ay! The Easter break is over! Yay...”
Lef suddenly stopped typing, an
overwhelming feeling of sadness taking
over him. He thought of all those hours
he’d idly spent in bed, no stupid print
deadlines, no stupid paper distribution cutting his
sleep short. He thought of all that nutritious cooking
he’d have to kiss goodbye, replacing it with packed
lunches and canned energy drinks. He thought of the
Met Gala. “Seriously Katy Perry what was going on
with that head piece. Veils are cool and all but those
side mirrors and bed springs that were glued on your
head were questionable at best.” He eye-rolled but
there was no one there to see it.
Lef reigned his easily distracted brain in and tried
focusing on that overwhelming feeling of sadness.
He tried not to smile as he revelled in self-pity in fear
of ruining the sadness. Not many things gave him
pleasure like a good dose of drama did.
He pressed and held backspace. He couldn’t start his
editorial with “Yay!”. “I’m not Drew Barrymore,” he
thought. Indeed he was going for something between
Liza Minnelli and Jane Fonda.
He typed “Sup” followed by “cunts”. Again he
stopped, lips pursed tight forming a grimace of sassy
indigestion. “Now that’s really wrong”, he thought.
“I sound Australian. Not sure what kind of Australian
but definitely not the cool kind you wanna be friends
with.”
He stopped. Was there really a point in this exercise
of self-indulgence? Does anyone ever even read
editorials? What is an editorial? Is he trying too hard?
How many questions can he ask consecutively before
it gets too much? Ten? Twenty?
“Fuck it,” he thought and concluded that whoever
it is that picks up the paper anyway would have to
do without an editorial. It’s not like they don’t know
what’s in the paper. Some news, some nudes, some
horoscopes, the usual. He was going to go home early.
