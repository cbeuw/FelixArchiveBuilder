tuition loans; not only are
tuition fees themselves now
subject to increases with
inflation, so too is the interest
due to the RPI + 3% system.
This gives students a double-
hit on the level of debt they
find themselves in.
Add to this the removal of
maintenance grants for poorer
students and the scrapping of
NHS bursaries for nurses, and
it is easy to feel glum about
the future of Higher Education
in the UK and the capacity for
widening access to it.
But this summer gives
students a chance to make
a stand against this. Don’t
stand by in silence and watch
as the mountain of debt you
find yourself in continues to
insidiously grow around you
and overshadow your future.
The choices this country
makes at the ballot box have
a demonstrable impact on
all of our lives, so don’t lose
your voice – make the choice
to stand up for your interests,
and register to vote for the
change you want to see.
Y
ou probably
missed the
memo, buried
deep under a
pile of revision
notes but the
fact remains: The cost of your
degree has just increased.
Interest rates on student
loans have risen by around a
third – up from 4.6% to 6.1%.
The reason for the increase
stems from changes first
introduced in 2012 to the way
student loans are repaid. The
new policy links the interest
rate payable on student loans
to the Retail Price Index (RPI)
+ 3%.
The erratic nature of the
U.K. economy since the EU
referendum last year has seen
the value of the pound fall, and
with it the RPI has increased
to 3.1%; this is compared to
1.6% last year, and 0.9% the
previous year.
What this really means for
students is that the level of
debt we will accumulate by the
time we graduate will increase
in very real terms – before in
fact, we even begin paying
anything back. So let’s say
you started your degree three
years ago with annual tuition
fees at a base rate of £9,000.
After one year you’d have to
pay back your tuition fees plus
the interest rate (3.9% at the
time) coming up to a total of
£9,351. Assuming tuition fees
and interest rate remained the
same over the course of your
three year degree, by the end
of it you’d have racked up a
total debt of £29,160 (or the
initial £27,000 of tuition fees
plus an additional £2,160
worth of interest). But given
the current increase in interest
rate, you’d have a total debt
of £29,914 instead. That’s
£754 of additional debt
equivalent to one month’s
worth of London rent, before
you’ve even started paying
your student loans off.
This scenario only describes
a standard bachelor’s degree
under these changes. Over
the course of four years (or
six for medics), with no cap to
the level RPI can rise to, and
particularly in the immediate
economic aftermath of
Britain’s divorce from the EU,
students could see thousands
of pounds being added
onto their loans before they
graduate.
The Intergenerational
Foundation is now referring
to us as the ‘Packhorse
Generation’; saddled with
billions of debt that many
of us will never be able to
pay back in full. Indeed, the
amount of student debt owed
currently stands at around
£76bn, compared to £34bn
in 2011 – with much of this
debt now being sold off by
the government to private
companies.
Further cause for concern is
the additional front-loading of
debt that will be introduced
this coming November. With
tuition fees now set to rise in
line with inflation, increasing
the maximum amount payable
to £9,250 starting this year,
the level of debt students can
accrue is increasing, as is the
interest they will be expected
to pay on it.
Due to this, it can be argued
that students pay a double
inflationary ‘uplift’ on their

Watched by a record 9400

audience members wonder
what secrets board members

It is unclear whether the alarm

as part of a practical joke.
Unfortunately the evacuation
was of little use to graduates
