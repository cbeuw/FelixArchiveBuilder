T
hey are just a
gang of back-
chat comedians
deliberately
undermining
morale with this
impertinent, unpatriotic rag.”
So goes Lieutenant Colonel
Howfield’s complaint about
The Wipers Times, a satirical
trench newspaper brought
to life in the Arts Theatre
thanks to Ian Hislop and Nick
Newman.
James Dutton is somewhat
reminiscent of Alan Alda in
M*A*S*H, playing Captain
Fred Roberts who remains
defiantly cheerful in the face
of the horrors of his daily life
yet is still privately vulnerable
and afraid of what might
happen in the very uncertain
future. George Kemp is
during a Q&A session after
one performance. The jokes
are a stark contrast between
terrible puns and what Hislop
describes as a “sharp, black,
callous, extraordinary level of
humour.”
This dichotomy sets the tone
of the show, which sand-
wiches the heart-breaking
poignancy you would expect
from a World War I drama
between surreal sketches and
comic music hall routines. It
is refreshing to see that the
entire cast is strong through-
out these song-and-dance
numbers. These musical
interludes (used to glide from
one scene to the next) are all
original compositions from
Nick Green and take poetry
directly from the pages of the
newspaper as their lyrics.
Almost as unexpected is
the large number of women
in amongst the uniformed
Tommies. If I counted cor-
rectly, Clio Davies and Emilia
Williams rotate between nine
distinct female roles. In fact
almost everyone in the cast
switches effortlessly between
multiple roles, whether that
be between major roles
(when not busy printing The
Wipers Times as Sergeant
Tyler, Tetsell is promoted to
General Mitford and the
Deputy Features Editor of the
Daily News) or doubling up
as a host in the fantasy hippo-
dromes of Roberts’ mind.
Also to be saluted is
the genuine camaraderie
depicted between the men of
the 24th
Division, particularly
Henderson (Kevin Brewer),
Barnes (Jake Morgan), and
new recruit Dodd (Peter
Losasso). The credit for the
best scene in the show how-
ever has to go to Sam Ducane
and Ross McLaren, portray-
ing jumped-up army sticklers
Lieutenant Colonel How-
field and his aide-de-camp
Bobbing Bobby. Roberts and
his men can barely keep a
straight face as Howfield
(who is adamantly against
the publication) asks if
Roberts thinks the division
is being offensive enough.
Ducane also makes a rather
wonderful (albeit incredibly
brief) appearance as the most
stereotypical Frenchman you
could possibly imagine but I’ll
leave you without context for
that one.
One of the piece’s stronger
points is its scope for

a perfect complement as
Lieutenant Jack Pearson, who
cautions and encourages
Roberts in equal measure.
Upon discovering a printing
press, the pair decide to set
up a weekly newspaper. Their
endeavours are enabled by
Sergeant Tyler (Dan Tetsell),
who conveniently worked as
a Fleet Street printer before
war broke out. Despite com-
plete editorial inexperience
(and the difficulties that come
with working in the middle
of a warzone), Roberts and
Pearson managed to print 23
issues of The Wipers Times
(named after the mispronun-
ciation of Ypres by the British
soldiers) from its inception in
1917 to the end of the war in
1918.
Over the 100 years that
have since passed, The
Wipers Times and its creators
were largely forgotten. Until
Hislop found a copy of the
paper whilst working on a
Radio 4 documentary.
“Neither of us had seen
anything like it before
because it was so surprising
to find that people were
making jokes at all in that sit-
uation.” Newman explained
improvisation. Newman jokes
that “it’s very annoying that
people like Dan [Tetsell]
keep slipping in very funny
lines”. On one occasion, a
spilled glass prompted Tetsell
(parodying a famous war cor-
respondent) to remark “That
went badly… it’s been a long
war”, drawing thunderous
applause from the audience.
It’s the freedom to drop in
moments like this that has
allowed The Wipers Times
to develop into a richer and
more nuanced performance,
despite its relatively short run.
I should know — at time of
going to press, I’ve been to
the show six times and I have
no plans to stop any time
soon.
The Wipers Times moves
from heart-racing exhila-
ration to touching sobriety
at an incredible pace. At a
recent performance, I heard
an audience member saying
how familiar the play feels.
And it’s true. Every time I
hear the overture, it feels like
coming home – the common
hope shared by all the British
soldiers.
