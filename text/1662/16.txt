or fans of Brutalism,
the Barbican’s
architecture is a
fixation in itself, so I
thought that was the
perfect venue for the
world premiere of Obsession,
the new play by the highly
acclaimed Belgian director
Ivo van Hove.
A stage adaptation of
Visconti’s first feature film
Obsession (1943) – itself
inspired by the 1934 James
Cain crime novel The Post-
man Always Rings Twice
(1934) – is, in a way, quite a
controversial choice for van
Hove, if you consider that
Visconti’s Obsession is one
among the opera prima of the
Italian neo-realism movement;
in van Hove’s adaptation
there is nothing left of the
effective at conveying the
coveted guilt that follows the
murder; in contrast, Reijn
starts with the right air of
boredom and anguished
solitude, but is quickly
re-animated by the sudden
appearance of the charming
stranger, later appearing
focused and determined to
re-order her new window's
life expanding the business
with her partner-in-crime.
It was my first Ivo van Hove
stage production but, by
tossing away all Visconti’s
'made in Italy' atmospheric
elements, I immediately felt it
had the very distinctive look
and sound of an auteur. From
start, he placed van Aschat
and Reijn in a theatre venue,
which itself contributes to the
construction of a contempo-
rary non-space.
The stage is stark, kept at
bare minimum; septic, its con-
tours are linear, uninterrupted
apart from some cut geomet-
ric volumes and Perspex
windowed doors, all softly
back lit. The visual element
on stage that metaphorically
crashes the characters is a
sinister suspended combustion
engine that unsettles through-
out the play, with its rumbling
noise, smoke, and spewing
of blood-like oil. Aside from
this, an automated harmonica
supplies part of the music
and a discrete treadmill that
emphasises the meaningless
attempt of the characters
to escape, but eventually
running nowhere. The whole
glorious design set is the
successful result of a long-
term collaboration between
van Hove and the highly
talented Jan Versweyveld and
it is one of the play’s biggest
strengths.
Although there is no
addition to the stage – apart
from Reijn trashing the floor
with a bin-load while madly
singing a French song – there
is a dynamic soundscape of
music, rhythmic notes, and
outdoor Foley of crickets and
cats, in which the characters’
fates unfold, as they run
towards an inevitable climax
of death. The rich soundscape
also accounts for some issue
about the adaptation of
dialogue: flat and slow, it can
hamper the conversation’s
pace. But, when everybody is
silent, it allows you to appre-
ciate the stylishly perfect
aesthetic of the set as well as
Jude Law's physique du rôle.

Jude Law as Gino in a new stage adaptation of Vis-
conti's penetrating social drama directed by Ivo van
Hove // The Barbican
original’s atmosphere of
social misery, so clearly what
allured the Belgian director
was the obsession angle, the
fixated passion that consumes
the two characters, and
the impossibility to sustain
it without leading to their
destruction.
Gino is a magnetic and
feline drifter played by an
intense joy-for-the-eyes Jude
Law, who wanders into an
isolated cafè and encoun-
ters its owner, Joseph (Gijs
Scholten van Aschat), and
his much younger, frustrated
wife Hanna (Halina Reijn).
Fatally attracted, Gino and
Hanna engage in an affair
whilst plotting to murder her
husband; but the guilt haunts
Gino, and their unbearable
passion drags them into a
fatally destructive spiral, in
perfect line with any Greek
tragedy.
The drama appears more
sexually charged than in the
original film, and the two lead
actors go at it with a passion
that will ultimately destroy
their idealistic romance. Law
is muscular, moody, and
features a company of very
talented Dutch and British
actors, led by Law, who all
give convincing, solid acting,
supported by a strong visual
element that always keeps the
audience engaged. But when
the climax comes – with its
overpowering music and its
cinematic seascapes raising
from the stage floor – all of
a sudden it derails the viewer
into a deep romantic territory,
losing the powerful noir tex-
ture of the drama. In the end,
while van Hove's version of
Obsession appears well exe-
cuted, and will still leave you
longing for the Belgian direc-
tor's next project, it lacks that
original power of Visconti's
movie, where passion arises
out of a sordid and desolated
social environment.
