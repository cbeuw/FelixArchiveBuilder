Controversial Tie Clubs paper passed
But not without drama (and extensive amendments)
Lef Apostolakis
D
uring the final
Council Meeting
of spring term,
a paper was
passed that
will limit the
presence of the Tie Clubs at the
Union. The invite only ‘secret’
clubs have been accused of
sexism, discrimination, and
elitism among other things in
the past and the Union has time
and time again reiterated it is
not in any way affiliated with
them. The paper, proposed
by Andrew Olson, attempted
to limit tankard use by Tie
Clubs by enforcing the Equal
Opportunities Policy.
Olson argued that according
to the policy, the Union should
“try and foster an environment
free of unfair discrimination
and harassment” and that any
club which fails to comply with
this policy as a consequence
shouldn’t have access to
Union resources. He argued
that merely the invitation only
mechanism in which the clubs
operate should exclude them
from using Union resources.
The paper is an attempt to
tackle concerns of a culture of
discrimination thought to be
prevalent within these clubs.
It did however cause many
Tie Club members to view it
as a witch-hunt and request
both anonymous voting and
amendments that would
remove references of the Tie
Clubs (namely the 22 Club,
the Chaps Club and the Links
Club from the paper). After a
vote it was decided that voting
would not be anonymous
As soon as the paper was
put to discussion, protests
started pouring in from the
floor, which saw a higher
number of students that usual,
presumably Tie Club members
and students that had come to
show support for the paper.
Almost immediately, ICU
President Nas Andriopoulos
protested allegations that his
involvement with the Tie Clubs
could interfere with carrying
out his role. “I have no problem
separating my professional to
personal life and I found any
insinuations in the paper and
on Facebook groups that I
couldn’t quite unimpressive,”
he said. Contrary to his
opening statement he
proceeded to argue almost
every point raised by Olson.
He also voted against Note
Three which put on record that
concerns have been raised
surrounding “certain alumni
groups” (referring to the Tie
Clubs) and Resolution Two
which basically would amend
the Tankard Policy in order
to ban groups that violate
the Safe Space Policy (again
referring to the Tie Clubs) from
using tankards.
Ellie Winstanley current
ACC Chair and XV’s club
president as well as several
other Tie Club members and
representatives also took to
the floor to protest certain
points. Winstanley claimed
certain club leaders had been
trying to “modernise” certain
clubs to make them “more
progressive” and maintained
that the XV’s were in fact
a sister group to the 22s.
Regarding the XV’s she said
“We do not discriminate based
on gender and on race and I
feel like not acknowledging
the progress that we’ve
made is in fact hindering it.”
Though this change might be
happening it should be noted
that the Links for example only
have one female member who
is currently a student.
James Cox Deputy President
for Clubs and Societies and
a Tie Club member also
took to the floor to defend
the organisations. Cox
claimed there’s been a lot of
misinformation surrounding
what these “public facing,
self organising alumni
associations” do and do not
get up to and proclaimed
his disappointment in the
marginalisation of Tie Club
members to several audience
members’ amusement.
“The motion today ignores
the efforts of recent years to
allow anyone who wants to
come along and wants to get
to know the club members to
be part of one. The clubs don’t
want people to feel like they
can’t come along if they want
to even if that’s not coming
across. These are students
facing the same financial,
physical and mental health
issues as everyone else, not
privileged private-schooled
boys as people might believe.
I can’t personally seem to get
my head around as to why
groups renowned for the
promotion of free expression
have rallied in support of a
paper that marginalises a
small minority of students and
how they spend their free
time.”
Several students also showed
up to push for measures
against Tie Clubs. Notably
Fintan O’Connor, newly
elected Deputy President for
Welfare was unforgiving.
“This paper is not out to smear
Tie Clubs or to smear their
members”, O’Connor said
adding that it was an effort to
create an inclusive and open
community and concluding
that “it’s inconsistent with our
beliefs to continue to support
a relic of institutionalised
privilege [referring to the
invitation only policy] even in
such ways as tankard storage
and that is why I’m supporting
this paper.”
When pressed for details
on the process behind the
invite only mechanism Tie
Club members said it’s about
“meeting” and “interacting”,
whatever that means.
After a lengthy discussion
of amendments, the paper
passed with a majority
vote. Notable votes against
several notes, beliefs and
resolutions predictably came
from Andriopoulos, Cox,
and Winstanley but also
from RSMU President Noah
Hawkings and ICSMSU
Academic Affairs Officer
Claudia Caravello. The full
breakdown can be found
online.
Alex Adler a postgraduate
Council members was satisfied
with the result. “I’m glad
the paper passed despite
the amendments which I
feel slightly weakened the
sentiment. I’m happy to see
that a subject could raise such
vigorous debate in Council,
although I would rather see
it also happen with issues
more relevant to the student
experience, like tuition,
bursaries and racism.”
The Union spearheaded
by Deputy President Finance
and Services, Rachel Blythe is
expected to soon start dealing
with the Tie Club tankards.
