emember that RSM
chemical spill that
sent three people
to the hospital
earlier in March?
Turns out the culprit
was escaped hydrochloric
acid fumes generated by the
polymerisation of a forgotten
container of acryloyl chloride,
according to an email
circulated by Eddie Hartrick,
Process Safety Officer.
According to Hartrick’s email
this is the second incident
of this nature, involving this
particular substance, in the
last 18 months.
“If left in storage for a long
time (even in the fridge and
at the correct temperature) it
can polymerise in the bottle,”
explains Hartrick in his email.
“This generates HCl gas and
increases the pressure in the
bottle until it leaks. As it is
stored in a fridge there is no
chance that the fumes will be
extracted.
Acryloyl chloride is fatal
if inhaled and is also a
lachrymator (induces tears),
making it difficult to clean up
and generally deal with safely
in the case of a leak.
The March incident was a
result of a bottle put in the
fridge by a PI who has now
left the department. The bottle
was forgotten, ultimately
leading to the polymerisation
of the acryloyl chloride
contained within and the
release of hydrochloric acid
fumes. Staff has been advised
to check fridges and ensure
the disposal of any forgotten/
unused acryloyl chloride.
The same advice has been
issued with stores of Acryloyl
chloride (contains MEHQ as
stabiliser), Acryloyl chloride

Chemical spill culprit confirmed New Dean
new day
new life for
Engineering
S
tarting this October,
College will be
welcoming Prof.
Nigel Brandon as
its new Engineering
Dean. Though he
is currently the Director of
Imperial’s Sustainable Gas
Institute (ha), Brandon’s love
affair with Imperial dates back
to the 70s, when he started his
undergraduate degree and
later did his PhD. Since then,
he’s held positions at BP and
Rolls Royce, as well as at the
UK Research Council’s energy
programme. Brandon will be
replacing Prof. Jeff Magee
who’s held the role of Dean
since 2011. He’s been serving
as Vice-Dean (Research) for
the past year.
In a press release, the
Provost James Stirling
welcomed Brandon calling
him “the ideal person to
lead the Faculty through this
exciting next stage”. Brandon
seems to be equally stoked,
finding the opportunity “a
tremendous privilege” and
“looking forward to us all
working together to realise the
opportunities ahead in both
teaching and research.”
I just wish we could all get
along like we used to in middle
school. I wish I could bake a
cake filled with rainbows and
smiles and everyone would
eat and be happy.

It was totally what we thought it was
(contains phenothiazine as
stabiliser), Acryloyl chloride,
Methacryloyl chloride,
Methacryloyl chloride
(contains 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-
methylphenol as stabiliser)
and Methacryloyl chloride
(contains monomethyl ether
hydroquinone as stabiliser).
Catchy names, I’m sure you’ll
agree.
A College spokesperson told
felix that Imperial has revised
its procedures in light of the
incident. “The chemical will be
substituted with an alternative
where possible, and Acryloyl
Chloride no longer be stored
long-term.”
Keep track of your chems
kids.
Jazz and Rock fans still homeless
T
he summer term
might be here but
Jazz and Rock
fans don’t see
no light in that
long, long tunnel
affectionatelyreferredtoasthe
Jazz and Rock redevelopment.
Not yet anyway. The practice
room was meant to have
been delivered to students by
the end of April but it seems
the works are still ongoing.
The room is still in need of
electrical work which is not to
be completed until Monday
the earliest. The most recent
estimate for the completion of
the works is two weeks from
now. “Having waited literally
years, two more weeks isn’t
the end of the world, says
James Stanley Tangent, Jazz
and Rock president and all-
round campus personality.
“It’s still annoying though.”
In response, ICU President
Nas Andriopoulos told felx
that the Union has “been clear
all along that the priority is to
ensure the work succeeds and
with a project that possesses
such technical challenges
everyone has been working
with that aim as paramount,
rather than rushing for hasty
completion. The Jazz & Rock
Society President and other
student-users have been
involved at every stage –
even choosing the location of
plug sockets and colour of the
walls!”
This is the latest in a series
of waves of delays. The £1
million refurbishment was
originally delivered back in
2014 but a number of sound
isolation complications meant
the closure of the practice
room. Three years and over
a quarter of a million later,
attempts to mitigate sound
insulation are still underway.
This marks the third delay the
project has suffered this year
alone. Hopefully the end to this
saga should be near but one
Jazz and Rock member that
would like to stay anonymous
points out that all bets are off
until delivery. “My only real
worry now is what the fuck
happens if the soundproofing
hasn’t actually worked.” Yours
and mine both buddy. Yours
and mine both.
