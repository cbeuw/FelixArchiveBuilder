fter years of
Nintendo-only
games, we
finally get a
free-to-play
Fire Emblem
game for iOS and Android.
This spinoff is a simplistic
but entertaining spin on the
strategy RPG series that offers
long-time fans something light
to enjoy between last year’s
Fates and next year’s game
for the Switch.
The Fire Emblem series is
a turn-based strategy game
where you command a
group of soldiers to fight and
defeat another group. The
playstyle seems simple but it
gets addictive very fast. If you
want to win and have all your
units survive, you need to
plan ahead and be strategic
about how you play. One
wrong move could make the
difference between losing all
your players and defeating
the enemy.
In the other mainstream
games of the series, you
control about 12-13 units at
once, have to move around
a large map filled with
on-the-go play and newbies.
Of course, this small-scale
nature doesn’t work in the
game’s favour all the time. If
you’ve played any main-
stream Fire Emblem games,
you’ve gotten to experience
their amazing storylines and
you’ve sampled all kinds
of different arenas. You’ve
gotten to see characters
develop and build stronger
relations with each other. By
contrast, Heroes’ story is a
paper-thin and there are only
three or four characters that
are really integral to the plot.
If you really want a truly fun
and immersive experience,
you’re better off buying any
of the other Fire Emblem
games.
Having said that, the mobile
version does pack a really
cool exclusive feature which
allows you to use and play
with any of the characters
from Fire Emblem’s long
history. This gives the game
the same fun ‘collect ‘em all’
aspect that’s made Pokémon
so popular. The only problem
this causes is that all the
fan-favourite characters have
a rarer occurrence rate, so
you’ll probably spend your
time getting mostly C-list
characters. Adding insult to
injury is the fact that these
rare popular characters are
objectively better than your
average C-lister. So playing
with a unit you’re not a great
fan of when in addition they
obstacles and sometimes
have to deal with enemies
who just keep on coming. Fire
Emblem Heroes by contrast,
is much more simplified and
small-scale. You only control
four units at a time and the

map is small enough to fill
your entire screen. This means
each round is shorter yet
this makes it a much better
fit for mobile platforms. You
open the game, get a quick
ten-minute fix and you’re
back to whatever you were
working on. Unless you have
terrible self-control, in which
case before you know it you’ll
have spent a good hour on it.
This game doesn’t have the
random number generators
that have been known to
make the original games frus-
trating as heck. Also absent
are the more subtle features,
such as weapons durability,
permadeath, and unit pairing.
The more simple nature of this
game takes away from the
excitement of trying to get
through difficult levels, but on
the other hand, this it makes

can’t even pack a punch, can
get old fast. Still, overall, the
feature is nice and there’s a
real novelty to seeing charac-
ters from different games all
work together in your team.
Outside of the story, there’s
plenty you can do to level
up your characters and have
fun. You can fight it out in
the Training Tower or battle
with other people’s teams in
the Battle Arena. There’s lots
of rewards you can earn to
incentivise you to keep play-
ing and the game mechanics
are such that you never truly
feel stuck. There’s also always
something you can do or a
freebie you can get that can
help you make your way
forward.
Fire Emblem Heroes may not
be perfect but it’s definitely a
fun experience and a good
start of bringing the expe-
rience to smartphones and
tablets. Despite its shortcom-
ings, the spectacularly fun
battles and ability to meet old
Fire Emblem friends makes
this game worth the free
download.
