Standby

The sun is shining, the birds are
singing, and it's not only the
prospect of exams looming
heavily on the horizon. So does
the question of baring your pasty
all to the waiting world this
summer.
Apart from finding discrete
corners of Hyde Park in which to
toast your limbs, the next big
problem is hair. Isn't it strange
how fashions change. When i was
younger, i'm sure that hairy chests
were considered the macho thang
- and bald heads despicable.
These days, presumably alongside
the cult of minimalism, no hair
anywhere, is seen to be the goal. I
have hunted high and low on this
one (being a fair skinned maid but
dark of head) and found that by
far the cheapest and the best of
ministering angels is nicole
fenton.
Considering that the chosen
person will regularly see you semi-
naked and hairy, it is above all
else essential that they are
friendly, able to keep a straight
face and possess no hidden
cameras. Nicole combines all
three of these skills with the
cheapest prices in SW London, a
great sense of humour and a
realistic understanding of the
student budget. As required, she
has become one of my better
friends, not least because she
does a better job than any one
else who's had the pleasure of
ripping the hair from my legs.
With correct after care, waxing has
the best effect; re-growth is
thinner, sparser and slow. After
the first time it doesn't hurt, and
leaves none of the sliced up flesh
so commonly found floating in the
bath after shaving. Nicole is
trained in everything from
electrolysis through massage to
aromatherapy - and, more
importantly, is highly unlikely to
call you 'Dahling'.
Prices are from £ 1 2 for a
facial; £24 for full leg, underarm
and bikini; or just £6 for waxing to
the knee. All of these prices will
have 1 0% deducted on production
of your student card. The average
massage is £12.50 and lasts half
an hour.
For any men tempted to
succumb to popular hair density
norms, do first remember that the
sexiest man in films has a balding
head and an undeniably hairy
chest. May Sean Connery continue
to be the model for you all.©

Just reach out and run your hand down the nearest naked
leg. If you get splinters then Fiona's waxing column is
waiting to smooth things out. If not, it's a black eye for you.
Eye to glass, tintin observes the pulsings of mercury rev, Guy
destrings under the influence of morphine and Vik continues
his assault on Rock, hand in hand with clawfinger and
trouble. Joe bring up the rear live-listening to denzil.

Catfish rolls up his sleeve for a dose of outbreak, tintin takes

Cohen takes a walk to seedy street in exotica.
The start of another term and rotation sets sail under the
capable captaincy of music editor Vile.
