Take Me (I'm yours)
Christan Boltanski
Serpentine Gallery
Hyde Park 0777 402 6075
10am-6pm. Last day.
Chances are you've
already heard of this one.
Another 'deconstructing
the medium' job involving
piles of clothes, food and
jumble that you are
encouraged to make your
own. However, atten-
dance toward the end of
today seems to be to be
an excellent opportunity to
pick up large amount of
free food and clothes, as I
doubt the place will be
overrun with fat wallet col-
lectors, and who's going
to store this stuff? Rather
against the point, eh?

Richard Avendon
National Portrait Gallery
St. Martin's Place (off
Trafalgar Square} WC2
0777 306 0055 Free.
Avendon's photography
can be described as no
less than cruel. Faces are
totally harsh, fierce creas-
es, blotches, glances of
insanity rule the images.
No where to hide, the
portraits are caricatures
of weakness, fault, fear.

Joe de Touches
The Commercial Space,
Albert Wharf, SE3.
07 77 344 0044. £12.
De Touches appears to be
in grotesque competition
with Damion Hurst, as his
hideous twisted human
figures, genuine we are
assured, slowly rot and fall
from their tragic poses.
Visitors, clad in supplied
masks amusingly try to
retain their composure as
the corpses yell "I demand
some booze!" and vomit.
