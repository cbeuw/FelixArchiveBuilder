Chaplain Ascends

Imperial College chaplain Paul
Brice surprised the College this
week with the news that, after six
years, he will soon be leaving the
West London Chaplaincy.
Paul, who recently won first
prize in the 'freestyle' section of
I B M ' s 'Leonardo da V i n c i '
multi-media competition, is
moving to become the Secretary
for Higher Education / Chap-
laincy for the General Synod of
the Church of England. He will
be based i n C h u r c h House,
Westminster but w i l l spend
much of his time visiting Univer-
sity chaplaincies nationwide.
M r Brice will be concerned
with issues in higher education
such as student finance, the
pastoral side of Chaplaincy care
and generally being the Synod's
'student expert'. In addition,
Paul said that "jacking up the
Internet side of things" would be
high on his agenda. "It's weird,"
he said "but I don't feel like I'm
leaving Imperial. I'll be cycling
past it every day and I'll still be
involved in higher education".
Paul is presently trying to
develop his multi-media 'Virgin
of the Unbelievable' carol service
for use i n a cathedral setting
whilst in June he will be giving a
one day workshop on 'Medium
and Worship' to a conference of
European Chaplains.
There w i l l be a farewell
'wine and nibbles' evening for
Paul starting at 5.30pm on
Tuesday 9th May at the 'Solar
Room and Gardens', 170 Queens
Gate. Those wishing to attend
should notify the Chaplaincy on
extension 49600.
NUS Referendum
(News in Briefcontinues from page 2)
Student Television Awards. First
prize in the 'Best Station Ident'
category went to Robin Riley, a
second year physics student. His
imaginative piece for STOIC is
based on frenetic movements
across a tube map.
Carlo Massarella, STOIC's
News Editor, narrowly missed
out on second prize in the 'News
and Current Affairs' category. His
entry, 'Election '95' was described
by the judges as a 'report of high
quality'. M r Massarella later said
he was glad that: "the hard work
that many people have put into
the station over the year has come
up with good results".
B Y A N D Y S I N H A R A Y
With the Imperial College Union
(ICU) referendum on affiliation
to the N U S fast approaching,
there is much confusion over the
sources of funding for the 'pro'
and 'anti' campaigns. The two
groups were formed at the end of
last term to present both sides of
the argument to the student
body. Each campaign is allowed
to spend up to £160 promoting
their case.
There have been rumours
that the National Conservative
Students organisation might
fund the anti-affiliation
campaign. Andrew Reid of
Conservative Central Office told
F E L I X : "I think they're doing a
very good job r u n n i n g their
campaign at the moment ... I
hope they succeed."
He added that he felt the
NUS should be a common forum
for representation for all
students, irrespective of their
political sympathies. M r Reid
said that it should also provide
value for money, something he
wasn't sure "it had been for the
last couple of years." However he
did not indicate whether
Conservative Central Office has
been financing the anti-
campaigners. The head of the
anti-NUS affiliation campaign,
Sarah Thomas, told F E L I X that
they were receiving money, but
from a source who wished to
remain anonymous. " I ' m not
directly involved with the
funding" she said, "[but] we're
reasonably well organised." She
did indicate that their source
wished to 'keep a low profile'.
A spokesperson for the N U S
told F E L I X that whilst they
supported the pro-campaigners,
saying that it would be "nice to
have everybody in the club", they
would not directly fund the
proponents. According to Lucy
Chothia, I C U President, the pro-
campaign group w i l l not be
receiving cash from the N U S as
there would appear to be no
comparable source for the anti-
campaign lobby. However the
pro-campaign may be receiving
publicity material directly from
the N U S , the monetary value of
which would be deducted from
their £160 allowance.
Of the referendum itself,
she said: "It's important that
everyone votes, and finds out as
much as they can to form an
objective opinion."
Welcome back to college and to
the wonderful world of the
summer term. I always used to
enjoy this term because after the
cold splash of the exams there was
just this long float down into the
lethargic waters of the summer
holidays. Departments attempt to
maintain their inordinate levels
of fear by setting end-of-year
projects but usually in even the
most diligent case the post-exam
student calculates how many
marks they are worth: whilst
lying on the Queen's L a w n
wondering when to start. W i t h
one half of the student populace
revising and the other half
reclining Imperial finally seems a
nice place be...
M y woes (of course)
U N L E S S you are the editor of the
student newspaper. This term
becomes a crisis of self-doubt, of
realising your insignificance in
the face of your writers doing
exams, no news because nobody is
around to make any and half
collected piles of F E L I C E S
littering the corridors until some
kind hearted cleaner takes pity
and kerosenes the lot.
So we w i l l be s h r i n k i n g a
little this term: I want to provide
relevant(ish) stuff rather than
relevant stuff with a few pages of
substandard material to boost the
size. ( A n d with inadequate
funding from the Union as paper
prices rise, it'll provide a useful
model of 'restraint').
But all those people out there
who either promised me things
and never wrote them, or
promised themselves that they
would contribute something but
never promised me (this is
starting to sound incestuous) -
there is still time! A n d you will
get an even more joyous reception
in the office than you would have
in the crowded months before,
although my lone cries of thanks
may sound a little spooky in the
silence that echoes i n F E L I X
T O W E R S .
Where does all the money go?
In the light of recent cuts i n
Union funding (because, we are
assured, the whole college is
being affected by H E F C E cuts)
we may require new fund-raising
efforts lest F E L I X becomes a
stunted kitten forever. With the
economy picking up, I shall soon
be popping down to ' O u r
Computers R Yours' warehouse
on Queensgate where I hear credit
facilities are good and top-range
equipment is available to a l l .
Everyone seems to be moving
into the computer market these
days and if you can't beat them...
