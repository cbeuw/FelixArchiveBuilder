he most creative aspect of
having a McJob is justifying
being in one. A twenty hour
week gives me ample time to read
Douglas Coupland's book and
watch 'Slacker' (again & again)
yet, when inevitably bumping into
past acquaintances, I still find
myself calling on "time off to
travel".
Rather than suspect I haven't
the courage of my convictions, I
find I just surf the pretensions and,
er, generally try and make the
most of it. So, does a tedious job
stimulate your thought processes?
Could my humble shop job be a
spiritual route of intellectual self-
depravation, a daily ritual of
monotonous activities & 'shop talk'
mantras? Well... no. The person
responsible for that idea obviously
hasn't stuck at a boring job for
longer than a few days.

Shallower rewards than
enlightenment however, include
the opportunity to be that moody,
mouthy, snobbish, know all, intim-
idating Sales Assistant, as well as
the chance to spot a familiar face.
Within a week of starting at Miss
Selfridge I spotted Paul Weller
reclining on a fixture in d fluffy
pink jumper, a matronly and very
brunette Samantha Fox and half a
dozen assorted sitcom actors.
Still I wasn't quite prepared for
indie royalty. Despite the years
since Harriet Wheeler (the
Sundays) came & went (again) I
wasn't prepared for her maturity
and total lack of quirky insecure
indiekidness (life goes on and
indiekids grow up ... shit)
On disillusionment, there can
be nothing more shattering than
seeing the ethereal Alison Shaw
(the Cranes) in her underwear.
Frater Fiam writes
Your good Frater sits in his cell,
staring at the inscriptions littering
the walls. He has become
incarcerated by the endings of
untruth and doubt. As you no
doubt are aware, he was a man
whose life was devoted to the
quest, his search for fulfillment in
understanding. He sought to know
the world. The ending of this quest
was not due to his achieving his
aim, his attainment of fulfillment.
He was arrested by the lure of his
prison cell.
Until the present time, his
existence had been one of doubt;
a state of seeking for the certainty
that he considered could be
provided by answers. He sought
the understanding, the meanings
with which life could hold to some
kind of sense. Some might say that
Luckily she walked past the
communal bit in the changing
room and snuck in a cubicle to try
on her kinky leather trousers. A
relief for me but this tale brings
only disappointment from a male
audience.
Generation X:
This is a book by Douglas Coupland
which described the behaviour of a
generation which he called 'X'
(hence the title of the book). It as
become a modern 'lifestyle' classic
Generation Y:
This is primarily an invention by the
Independent newspaper which
describes the behaviour of a
generation which it called 'Y'
(hence the title). Determined
attempts to find an example of this
generation have met with failure
however, which suggests that like
the 'typical Independent reader',
they are merely a figment of the
editor's imagination.

such a quest would be futile from
the outset; they might be correct,
but the Frater considered futility to
be an useful utility, a tool which
could bring him closer to his goal.
Such was the nature of his
foolishness. He explored the
abberations of human normality,
and each expedition led him
deeper into the confusion that he
found. The soul of society is indeed
wounded and unsound, and thus
his seeking could only bring him
further from his goals. There could
be no end to such a task.
The end came not from his
quest, but from his eventual
abandonment of it. This was not
through failure, but was an act of
success. He discovered answers
which questioned his method of
fulfillment, and realised its flaws.
And thus he, your humble Frater,
chose to become imprisoned in a
chamber of constancy, with only
the inscriptions on the walls to
provide him with respite. And thus,
harnessed and with peace, shall
he remain.
"Put all the images in
language in a place of safety and
make use of them, for they are in
the desert, and it's in the desert
that we must go and look for
them."
—Jean Genet
