SPACE SILLER #1
3? Astronaut Mike
Collins left his
Hasseblad camera
" behind during the
"* Gemini 10 flight
in 1965
T w o m o n t h s ago, the Space
Shuttle launched three balls and
three pieces of wire into the
space lanes. Was it a mistake?
H a d the astronauts added six
new items to the 7000 pieces of artificial space
junk that are known to clutter the skies?
In fact, the deliberately oddly-shaped metal
objects are intended to teach ground-based scientists what such things look
like as they whirl in their orbits at seven kilometres per second. Assuming
that they didn't lose sight of the 5cm diameter balls the minute they let them
go, scientists will be able to use the data to learn how to track objects so small
as to be invisible to current radar systems - and yet so deadly they could
destroy a satellite.
Below, the facts about space debris. How much is there? How did it get
there? What threat does it pose to future plans?
A n d on the right, the view of one scientist who - for the moment -
doesn't feel much urgency about the issue. Read them both and make up your
own mind.

The vast emptiness of
space is actually pretty
crowded according to
the graph on the right,
/hich shows the
' fourteen-fold increase
\ in pieces of space debris between
| 1960 and 1988 (numbers represent
| thousands).
Space debris in low orbits
| eventually burns up as it drags on the
I outer atmosphere. Some debris in
j unstable orbits flies off into outer
j space.
But thousands of pieces remain,
| and the number is likely to keep
§ increasing, according to a paper
| published this month in the Journal of
j the British Interplanetary Society.
I The author reports findings
| which show that "the number of
! fragments will continue to grow and
i so present an increasingly hostile
\ environment". Where do these
\ fragments come from?
Since 1961, 116 satellites have
\ broken up in the sky. The worst
| single episode was the explosion of
j an Ariane rocket third
| stage in 1986, which
| alone contributed 461
jtrackable pieces of
\ debris.
j Currently, objects
smaller than 10cm
| across are invisible to
I radar. Satellite shielding
1 S-files interviewed Brian Wingfield, a
I research assistant in Imperial's Space Physics
\ department:
| You're involved in an experiment that will
j be carried into space by Ariane 5 at the
j end of this year. Are you concerned about
\ space junk?
j It's something we might chat about in the pub, but it's
| not something I feel too worried about. Space debris is
I inevitable because of the way satellites are launched. We'll
| have to clear it up before it gets too dangerous, but the
j number of successful launches is as is expected at the
j moment.
j Do you feel that the new experiment to track small
j debris is a signal that debris is becoming a more
: serious problem?
I don't think it has much significance, really. It just
\ depends when the money comes along to do the
J experiment. In theory the small space junk is a problem,
\ but there's so much space you're not likely to bump into it.
\ Do y o u worry that if m o n e y h a s to b e spent on
\ clearing up space junk then your funding might be
j reduced?
I I think extra money would be found from somewhere.
\ So space junk isn't that bad after all?
j Space junk is really a problem that we're creating for
\ ourselves. It wouldn't take a very
I large piece of debris to cause quite
I a lot of damage at those speeds.
| But if a piece of junk hit a launch, it
| would just be bad luck, really.
I You don't feel your experiment
\ is at risk, then?
j On the whole I tend to think
\ that someone else takes the space
\ junk into account in the launches.
