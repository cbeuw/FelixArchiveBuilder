The annual Inter-Continental Varsity Championships were held over the Easter break, writes Bryan Crotaz, and the
Imperial College Dance Club excelled themselves. Whilst individual couples won many trophies throughout the week it
was in the three team competitions that brought them greatest success. IC won first prizes in the best Student Team
Match and, surprisingly, the American Style Team Match - which involved competing against teams from across the
USA! Finally, to complete their hat-trick, they dressed up in monkey and elephant costumes and scooped the remaining
first prize, the Cabaret Team Match. With the heat in the costumes reaching a more than uncomfortable level, one
member commented "Anyone who doesn't think dancing is athletic should try that one!"
Naked Pride Over Exposed
BY JON J O R D A N
The less reputable side of
Imperial's reputation has been
further enhanced recently with a
display of 'national pride' i n
Southside bar.
The incident i n question
occurred on the 23rd of March,
the last Thursday of the spring
term. Two men climbed onto a
table and proceeded to remove
their clothing, leading to a
display of genitalia whilst the
national anthem was being sung
by their companions. Following
this, a complaint was made by
Caroline Garaway, a female
research student, to the South-
side Bar Manager, M r Roger
Pownall, and also circulated to
the Student's Union and F E L I X
(see Incoming on page 5).
M r Pownall was on duty the
night of the incident. He claimed
(Smash & Carry continues)
around the department the
previous Friday, the student, who
had already lost one computer,
confronted and pursued the two
thieves.
Incredibly one of the thieves
managed to escape by the same
route through the ground floor
maintenace area that had been

that there was little the staff
could have done to halt
proceedings because 'by the time
you get there it's over'. However,
the two individuals concerned
were asked to leave the bar (they
were judged to be in a drunken
state and it is illegal to serve
drunk customers) and told to
come back the following day
when they had sobered up. "They
apologised and said it wouldn't
happen again" said Pownall.
When asked if this sort of thing
was a regular occurrence, he
replied "it's the first time it's
happened for eighteen months".
L u c y C h o t h i a , I C U Pre-
sident, said that it is U n i o n
policy that people are not allowed
to strip in public places and that
they "wouldn't get away with it
around here [the Union bar]".
Much of the problem seems
to stem from the i n i t i a t i o n
used earlier that week. In both
raids it is believed that this was
the criminals' method of entry to
the building and that the raiders
had planned to use this as their
means of escape.
T h e second criminal was
chased to the Security Lodge at
the front door of the H u x l e y
B u i l d i n g where the female
ceremonies practised by the
drinking clubs of the Constituent
College Unions. Sources have
told F E L I X that the incident in
question was a ' L i n k s ' Club
initiation. Links is the official
d r i n k i n g club of the City &
Guilds College Union.
Another episode last term
again saw naked Linksmen on
the loose, this time in Beit Quad.
The so-called 'quad run' broke
the rules laid down by the Union
as the initiants failed to keep
their boxer shorts on, nor were
the U n i o n and the Biology
Department aware that it was
going to take place. In the
circumstances this proved
unfortunate as Biology had an
admissions day at the same time.
The effect on the prospective
students, some of w h o m had
their parents with them, is not
known.
security guard called for
immediate backup.
In the few minutes before
extra personel arrived, the
intruder managed to break open
the double front doors of the
department, w h i c h had prev-
iously appeared to be locked, and
to make his escape out onto
Queensgate.
Rector's Reward
F o l l o w i n g the recent drop i n
IC's funding ( F E L I X 1023) the
Rector, Professor Sir R o n
Oxburgh, has declined to follow
the Vice Chancellor of
Manchester University's lead
who insisted that his shortfall
would not result i n any staff
redundancies. W h i l e empha-
sising that he did not 'forsee' any
layoffs Prof Oxburgh said that he
"could not possibly responsibly
give such an undertaking".
Speaking to F E L I X the
Rector seemed at ease with a
recent survey of college heads'
salaries w h i c h placed h i m i n
13th position. He pointed out
that in assuming his present role,
which sees him presiding over a
budget of Â£165M, he had taken a
wage cut. Sir Ronald suggested
that following the expected
medical merger there may be as
many as thirty or forty college
employees earning more than
him.
Crime Prevention Week
Burglars beware. Imperial
College's C r i m e Prevention
Week begins on Monday. The
regular bi-annual event has run
for the past ten years and, says
Local Community Officer P C
Clive Coleman, is always well
attended.
T h e Week centres on a
display in the Sherfield Building
Ante Room. It will incorporate
advice stalls, crime prevention
information and also free cycle
coding. T h e display w i l l be
manned from Monday, 1st May
to Friday, 5th May from 10am to
4pm.
P C Coleman believes the
information available will appeal
both to staff and students alike.
"We give good advice to students
- we can give advice on property
marking, personal security and
more," he told F E L I X . Further
information is available from
Sherfield Security or from Clive
himself on: 0171-321 6920.
Television Awards
STOIC, Imperial's own Student
Television station, had good
cause to celebrate with the news
that it had picked up two prizes
