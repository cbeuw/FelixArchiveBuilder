IC 4th vs QMW 2nd
A brilliant performance by
every team member to thrash
our final opponents of the sea-
son 4-0. This was just the
result required to make sure of
promotion to the second divi-
sion next year and rounded off
a great season for the fourths.
Flash Dick started off the
round, winning without rais-
ing a sweat, and not giving his
opponent a ball to hit. Then it
was Tricky Al's turn to
demoralise his opponent with
a number of clever little
boasts. Captain Gazza soon
followed, running his victim
into the ground and not show-
ing an ounce of mercy. It just
required Ding Dong Dave to
use all his years of experience
to round off the amazing
result. When two games up
and having not given a point
away he admitted feeling sorry
for his opponent and "gave
him" a couple of points in the
third game before winning.
That's our Dave!
Many thanks to all the lads
who have helped in our push
towards promotion this sea-
son... I hope you enjoyed the
experience!

Garden Hall 'A' vs Garden Hall 'B'
In what can only be described
as the match of the century,
the 'A' and 'B' teams met on
Tuesday evening in Hyde
Park with only one thing on
their minds: Beer - no, sorry -
Victory! Death or glory! A
battle to the finish, the mother
of all football games, the big
one, the ... sorry, I'm getting
carried away again [You will be
soon, shut up and get on with it
-Ed]. Ulp! Yes, both teams
wanted to win.
This was a unique event,
mainly because it was the first
(and possibly only) time a
Is there anybody out there!
It's exam season, and have all the sports teams fin-
ished for this year? Perhaps, but if there are teams
with results then we'll be happy (ecstatic even) to
print them - and just think of all those column-
inches waiting for your finely crafted prose to
fill them up. Otherwise I'll just have to make
them all up (not that I'd do anything like
that normally, you understand) or use the
page for... [pause for dramatic effect] ...
something else! Anyway, enough of this -
bye for now, and remember: be good!

IC Ist" vs Brunei
At 9.15am on Wednesday
morning 15 players turned up
to face the arctic conditions to
play the first fixture in this
years BUSA competition.
Brunei were the opponents
and the odds of winning were
stacked against us.
It started badly, when the
captain lost the toss and we
were put into bat. To start
strongly the captain and the
vice-captain decided to open
the batting. They were both
out without scoring! A mid-
FEL1X
die order fight-back led by
Tariq Javed and Gareth Perry
saw us to a modest total of
108 for our bowlers to take
over.
We got off to a brilliant
start after dinner and superb
performances by all of the
bowlers I. Lithau, S.Tressell,
J. Ishererel, T. Javed, S.
Milligan [Sorry, I can't read
any ofthese names in this 'hand-
writing'! Please print next time!
-Ed] and a courageous perfor-
mance by B. Richards as
wicket keeper saw us to our
first win of the season.
Well done and a beverage
to all who played!
dozen of Garden Hall's most
desirable men would be out
together wearing shorts (and
Doc Martins in some cases).
Unfortunately the park was
more crowded than we had
expected, probably due to the
unusually sunny and summer-
esque weather (global warm-
ing does have it's benefits,
obviously). But undaunted, we
set up our goals shooting into
the road and started.
For the first half an hour,
the 'A' team scored again and
again, (and that was not due to
a head-wind, Jim!) and even I
managed to score a goal
(which about as likely as win-
ning anything over £5 on an
Instants card). However, this
did present a number of prob-
lems, as every time we scored
the ball shot into the road,
much to the 'amusement' of
passing motorists, cyclists,
pedestrians, joggers and cou-
ples alike.
But we couldn't last forev-
er, and the tide turned; the 'B'
team scored again and again,
not helped by my goalkeeping
skills (or lack thereof) and
Simon lying down / having a
fag / running away from the
ball / etc.
Eventually, it became too
cold and dark to continue, and
we decided to call it a day. It
was at this point that we
realised no-one had been
keeping score, leading to the
promise of a re-match Real
