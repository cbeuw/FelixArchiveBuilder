Q vocal
outbreak
Tackling bach's mass in b minor
is a major challenge for any choir
of young voices, but at the end of
last term Eric Brown's choice of his
favourite choral work, performed
by the ic choir, paid off.
The choir had obviously
worked hard and for the most part
knew the piece well. The balance
was generally good, although at
times in the five part choruses, the
two soprano lines struggled
against the stronger sections. The
ensemble was also very good,
despite the tendency of both male
parts to rush their tricky quaver
passages. However the 'et
resurrexit' was sung with panache
and commendable accuracy by the
tenors and basses.
The conductor successfully
moulded the orchestra, led for the
first time by Maya Iwabuchi, into a
cohesive ensemble in spite of their
rehearsal time constraints.
Iwabuchi gave a virtuoso perform-
ance in her solo parts, matched by
equally sparkling renditions from
the oboes d'amore, flutes and
trumpet. The orchestra's sound
however, was marred in some
passages by the poor tuning of the
organ and harpsichord.
Amongst the vocal soloists
Frances Jellard must be congrat-
ulated for creditable singing
despite standing in at short notice,
and William Purefoy's purity of
tone once agin made him the
darling of the choir's sopranos
and altos.
Brown introduced several
thoughtful tempi throughout the
work. The finale, 'dona nobis',
was a touch too slow for the choir
to produce the sostenuto required
to communicate the full intensity
of the movement at the end of a
long and ardous concert. However
the choir once again proved
themselves to be one of the finest
student choirs with a great
performance of possibly the
greatest choral work. ©

In a nutshell, outbreak goes like
this: Army doctor discovers lethal
new virus in darkest Africa, virus is
written off as non-threatening by
his superiors, virus arrives in the
States and starts laying people out
left right and centre, doctor
discovers that military have ulterior
motives...
Which bring us to the main
problem. Outbreak doesn't know
what it wants to be; a comedy or an
action movie, an ordinary thriller or
a moralising crusade. It could have
been an edge-of-the-seat race
against time but it took too long to
get started. If could have been a
human interest story but it wasn't.
Instead, it tried to be funny,
which seems a little out-of-place in
a movie about imminent disaster. It
tried to give us a little character
detail (the two doctors are ex-
husband and wife, and working for
competing organisations), but that
was about all. It tried to be a
parable about military secrecy and
paranoia, but it wasn't anything we
haven't seen or heard before. But
most of all, this film fails because
when push comes to shove it's
really nothing more than a vehicle
for its stars. That said, there are
some reasonably good perform-
ances from the main cast, most
notably from Dona/d Sutherland as
the coldly remorseless general,
embodying the ruthless military
establishment.
Morgan Freeman turns in a
typecast heroic 'do-the-right-thing'
performance, which is a pity as he's
an actor of some quality. Dusfin
Hoffman was ok, I guess, but how
much talent does it take to act the
adrenalised shouter?
The film really contains too
little of everything to be much of
anything. In the end, a film which
could have been so many things got
watered down like a homeopathic
remedy and left us with nothing.
It's a strange phenomenon.
Just as our marriages are self
destructing with increasing
regularity so their cinemythical
properties seem to become ever
more potent. Still despite the
ominousness of its title, muriel's
w e d d i n g is more a case of life
being all around rather than the
hearts and honeymoons currently
being conjured up by Hugh Grant
and his ilk.
Squeezed beneath all that
white lace trappings is an old
fashioned and, in parts, very funny
rites of passage movie; young
slobby duckling gets out of dull
ditch water home, meets up with
fellow outsider and hits the big city
in search of a better life. However
after that point Muriel's Wedding
takes a sharp downward spiral into
depression, leaving the audience
feeling emotionally poleaxed.
Maybe it just demonstrates the
schizophrenic closeness of making
them laugh, making them cry.
Either way, it's a happy-sad
rollercoaster.
A painful unfolding of lasciv-
ious desires and sordid secrets,
exotica intertwine with a Pulp
Fiction-esque precision. The title
itself is a superlative worthy of the
film's sleazy down-town jungle-
themed strip club. It's not so much a
poignant parable as a forlorn tale
of lonely souls, basking in the
gloom of their solitary existence.
Francis Brown (Bruce Green-
wood), has lost his family in a series
of unfortunate tragedies. His
daughter was murdered, a year
later his wife died in an accident in
a car which was being driven by his
brother, her lover! Twisted enough
yet? The only escape from reality he
has left is Exotica. There, Christina
(Mia Krishner), Francis' favourite
dancer, plays the not-so-innocent
school girl, incarnating his fantasy
of his deceased daughter.
Director, Atom Egoyan man-
ages to enchant an atmosphere
which sticks the film together but
one can't help but feel that it was
done for the sake of the box office
rather than any statement about
such bizarre relationships. Q
