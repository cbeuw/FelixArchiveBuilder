A trip to Harlington
Keys: Fast, Furious, Fluid
Thursday 2nd March was a day of learning.
Learning that just because a hovercraft part
has been working well for so long that you
forget what it looks like, it doesn't mean that
it won't break/go wrong/collapse exactly
when you don't want it to. Of course, if you
are going to have one problem, why not have
them all?
Well the hovercraft (god bless it) bore
this in mind on that day, and even managed
to swing it so that the weather turned from
sun to sleet by the end of the day.
Unperturbed by this lack of co-operation
from the craft, the die hard hoverclubbers
invested i n their loss and returned to
Harlington sports ground one week later with
a vaguely modified craft, a large toolbox and
prayer mats. This outing was a different story
though. The hover behaved impeccably and
allowed four hours of trouble free flying.
The afternoon started with the novice
pilots taking the craft out for a spin around
the thankfully huge expanse of the sports
ground and when a bit of confidence and a
marginal idea of control had been built up, a
slalom course was next on the agenda. In turn
this was followed by two times' laps of a
figure of eight circuit. As the red mist
descended on the drivers during the last
event, the cones were shown no mercy. Some
went over, some went under and a few even
stayed standing.
Throughout the day, the hover seemed
easily capable of its 40 mph top speed which
may not sound so fast, but when you are
skimming along at about 20cm above the
ground with a brutally modified motorbike

engine screaming its tits off behind you, no
balanced person would say it was slow.
I could make claims that hover crafting
will enrich your life, will help you pass your
exams and could well contribute to world
harmony through the great spirit associated
with it, but all of those would be lies. The
truth is that it is excellent fun and a great way
to spend an afternoon.
Hoverclub meets every Wednesday in Old
Chemistry (through the grey doors as though you
were going to the lecture theatre, it's straight in
front ofyou).
