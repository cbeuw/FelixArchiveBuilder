Union's Door
Policy
Dear Editor,
I would like to clear up the
confusion amongst some of our
students regarding the right of
admission to the Union Building on
a Friday night and the reason that,
on occasion, we have to refuse
entry.
The Local Authority Fire Officer
sets an official limit on the
numbers using buildings. This is
based on the size of the area,
width of stairs, number of fire exits
etc. Three years ago, after
consultation with the police, the
Union decided that it would NOT
operate a 'one in, one out policy'.
This was agreed in order to reduce
the risk of our students disturbing
local residents or causing a
nuisance by having late night
queues in Prince Consort Road. It
also reduces the risk of outsiders
seeing a queue and trying to get
into, what is, a Private Event.
The bottom line is - once we
are up to capacity - that's it for the
night.
If the Union wishes to continue
to be allowed bar extensions we
must maintain our good
relationship with local residents.
This, of course, includes those
living in Beit Hall. Anyone using
the Union Building must respect
the needs of those living in Beit
Hall and the surrounding area by
minimising noise when entering or
leaving the building.
We are trying to offer the best,
value for money, night out in
London. To enable you to carry on
getting this we would advise you
that:
1: To guarantee that you get in
on a Friday night - get here early.
2: Should you be refused
entrance - either because we have
reached capacity or because you
are deemed to have drunk too
much - (it is a legal requirement
that we refuse entry to anyone we
'believe' to be drunk) please leave
the area as quickly and quietly as
possible.
3. Don't jeopardise the license
by disturbing local residents either
before, during or after an event.
Remember - we want to
entertain you in a safe, happy
environment but we can't do it
without your help. We should think
of others while we are enjoying
ourselves.
Mark
Events & Publicity Manager
It seems a shame that one area
where the Union is successfully
reaching a lot of students should
become a victim of its own success.
Safety obviously must come first,
but the downside is that perhaps
people are dissuaded from
attending the Union at all, thinking:
'well, we won't get in anyway';
maybe this was the reason for the
non-sellout attendance on the last
day of last term? I guess what we
need is a big multi-sectioned venue,
that can be closed off as necessary.
But the residents are a different
problem. It's obviously easier to
cater for 7500 students of an
evening out in the wilderness
somewhere than it is at IC, with our
'residents'. And 1500 is only 20% of
the total student populace.
Club Guide
Dear Felix reader,
Are you the chairman of a club
or society? If so, check your Union
pigeon hole NOW! I am editing
the 1995 iCU handbook and, if
you would like a mention in the
clubs & socs guide, you'll have to
send me some information! All the
details are on the letter which
should be in your pigeonhole - if
you don't have one, drop a note in
the "Handbook Editor"'s hole, or
email me (h.windsor@ic .ac.uk).
The deadline for entries is Friday
1 9th May, so get writing now!
Thank you for listening.
Helen-Louise Windsor
You'll also need to supply Helen-
Louise with a photo and remember
that she will be editing the entries
of 720 clubs and societies (together
with the rest of the handbook) so
don't say things like 'But you could
have phoned us' if you fail to write
an entry or, 'You could have
checked that with us' if she gets the
odd detail wrong. Sorry, handbook
editors get a lot of grief: a bugbear
in my bonnet. Be nice.

Clientele
Dear Sir/Madam,
Enclosed is a letter I have today
[24th March 1995] sent to the
manager of Southside Bar. I don't
know if this is something you are
interested in following up, but I
thought I'd let you know about the
situation. A bit of bad publicity
might go a long way or might at
least make some people think
about the consequences of their
actions - or is this hoping for too
much?
Yours faithfully,
Caroline Garaway

The Manager
Southside Bar
Dear Sir/ Madam,
I am writing to express my
deepest disgust for activities
occurring in Southside Bar on
Thursday 24th March between
6pm & 7pm. Whilst sitting with
colleagues for a drink after work,
two male students stood up on the
table 5 yards away from me,
dropped their trousers and pants,
and proceeded to parade their
genitalia around to everyone in the
bar for the duration of the national
anthem that was being sung
around them. My colleagues
(male&female) and I found this
both distressing & degrading. What
made the situation worse was that
those working in the bar did
nothing to stop the activity and in
fact I had the impression they
thought it was both acceptable &
entertaining. I'm afraid I didn't.
I have never made a formal
complaint about anything in my
life and having been in a
University establishment for many
years now, am well used to the
obnoxious behaviour of groups of
sportsmen after matches. This,
however, went to far. I would like
to know why such behaviour,
which would result in arrest and
criminal prosecution anywhere else
in the UK, is apparently condoned
in Southside Bar. I trust that you
will look into this matter urgently &
take steps to prevent it happening
in the future. I would like to think
that standards at IC are not above
the criminal and, after all, why
should the majority of drinkers at
the Southside Bar just have to put
up with it?
Yours faithfully,
Caroline Garaway

Caro//ne, where have you been?
This is, I've been told, an IC MAN at
his finest. Beit Quad on a rare
Friday afternoon is host to a
wonderful display of naked male
flesh jiggling, downed pints flying -
coming back out again - and
general beery laddishness. These
blokes are all perfectly decent
usually, so is it the beer or the
rugby balls? (I've never understood
why men have their malehood
doubted because they don't like a
sweaty hairy male arse shoved in
their face. And the number of girls
who've been interested in me
because I'm game to - in any social
situation - get my 'bits' out for the
lads I could count on my, errr,
collection of Sports caps).
These normally sensible and
likeable individuals will further
argue that their display is part of
IC's 'heritage'.
Of course! Hush now, I think I
hear Huxley singing 'four and
twenty virgins' in his grave...
