the episodes. Now there is a new
player out for revenge, Margaux
LeMarchal (Karine Vanasse), who
wants to expose Emily’s lies and
criminal activities for reasons of her
own. Another sudden new arrival is
Natalie Waters (Gina Torres), who
is competing with Victoria to be the
Queen Bee of the rich women of the
Hamptons. Get ready to sit through
some intense battle of bitchy words,
as one comeback after another
attempts to silence the opponent. And
to be honest, there is definitely more
going on, but things have gotten so
silly now it is no wonder that viewers
are turning away from the show. Still,
there is no denying that no other
show on television has a group of
women of mind-boggling intentions,
trying to outdo one another, getting
their claws out and sharpened for
their ultimate goals. Seeing what
stunning things these rich women
wear and how they plot behind each
other’s backs to get ahead in the
world, Revenge has certainly come
a long way since its days of Emily’s
focused mission.
Moving away from the affluent
East Coast to the more financially
strapped country music industry of
Nashville, Tennessee, Rayna James
(Connie Britton) has finally launched
her very own record label, Highway
65. It has been a long time coming for
the Queen of Country Music in the
third season of Callie Khouri’s show,
Nashville, and for her to set this up has
been no easy task. The show initially
started off as a prolonged catfight
set in the backdrop of the country
music industry, with the reigning
queen Rayna threatened by an up-
and-coming new star, Juliette Barnes
(Hayden Panettiere). But the show
wisely moved away from this, giving
each singer room to breathe and
find their own plausible storylines,
and the two interacting only when
necessary, not constantly at odds with
each other. As of now, the two are
happily working together, something
that would have been unimaginable
in the first season. With these two
singers of a massive celebrity status,
the show has explored the price of
fame on personal relationships, the
strain it puts on families, and how
perhaps, not everything is as it seems
on cameras and newspapers. It is
especially difficult for a female to be
under such intense media scrutiny,
particularly at a time of an immense
emotional struggle, and Nashville has
been consistently bold and honest
in showing the many downsides of
glittering careers and the flashing
lights of fame.
This was particuarly well-handled
with the naive young talented singer/
songwriter Scarlett O’Connor (Clare
Bowen) who has also been through
quite the rollercoaster ride. She tried
her hand at becoming a singing
sensation herself, but the pressure
was too much, and sometimes it just is
not meant to be for some people. But
she has found her calling elsewhere,
Emily Thorne and Victoria Grayson of Revenge are still going at it trying to ruin each
other’s lives for whatever reason that you have stopped caring about
focusing on writing, and playing in
smaller gigs with people she trusts,
a sweet and poignant dynamic she
has struck up with two of her ex-
boyfriends: an unlikely trio for sure,
but one that clearly works.
The newest recurring cast member
to be added to the show brings with
her a serious, weighty subject matter.
Sadie Stone’s (Laura Benanti) career
as a country singer is on the rise,
but things get complicated when
her abusive ex-husband shows up
out of the blue demanding a slice of
her earnings, even serving her with
a subpoena. Benanti’s trembling,
frightened portrayal of a battered
woman is often heart-breaking,
but she eventually makes a stand
to fight for what is rightfully hers,
bravely speaking out against her
manipulative ex. Rayna is right
there in Sadie’s corner, and the pair
of them refusing to be bullied into
submission is a well-structured,
important message for women and
men everywhere.
Already renewed for a well-deserved
second season is the most impressive
network primetime debut show of
this season, Madam Secretary. In its
pilot episode, former CIA analyst
Elizabeth McCord (Téa Leoni) is
happily living in a semi-retired state,
teaching politics and looking after
horses at her country ranch. But the
current Secretary of State is involved
in a fatal plane crash, Elizabeth is
called on personally by her mentor/
friend, the President of the United
States (Keith Carradine), to fill in the
position. Thrown into the deep end of
Washington’s political turmoil, each
episode sees Elizabeth deal with a
complex diplomatic situation.
Leoni excels in the central role,
as she leads the rest of the cast of
talented supporting players. She
projects intelligence and charisma
as she handles the most delicate
conflicts in the most humane,
sensible way, cleaning up after
people’s mistakes, being responsible
for all American nationals on foreign
soil, having to sign off on potentially
dangerous top-secret missions,
and to top it all off, she still has the
mystery of the former Secretary
of State’s death hanging over her
head. This season-long arc focuses
on what will most definitely develop
into a grand political conspiracy
once the show finds its footing. And
much like The Good Wife in which
every episode involves an intriguing
“case of the week” procedural style
as well as successfully adding one
big storyline to bring the season’s
episodes together, Madam Secretary
has great potential to be just that.
Except that instead of having legal,
courtroom cases, the writers have
more room to explore, given the
power and responsibilities the role of
the Secretary of State carries.
Her staff, consisting of excellent
actors Bebe Neuwirth, Patina Miller,
Geoffrey Arend and Erich Bergen,
all do their share of heavy-lifting in
terms of adding both drama and the
well-placed humour into the office,
but also playing an equally big part in
Elizabeth’s life is of course her family.
The way Leoni and Tim Daly (her
husband, Henry McCord) interact
completely sell the idea that they
have been in a loving, committed
relationship for many years now, and
the show gives plenty of screen-time
to their three children, adding more
perspective and insight to the show.
All in all, it looks to be a great time
for women in television. These are
only a handful of primetime network
dramas that are currently on air.
Cable is pushing the boundaries
even further. And there is certainly
noticeable movement of actresses
who worked predominantly on films
to head to TV for more complex,
deeper shows. And it is not difficult
to see why. The material being offered
in this industry is second to none, and
women are no longer the supporting
players, waiting to be rescued by
men. Instead they are the ones
taking charge, in powerful positions,
making the important calls, and it is
a continuing trend that thankfully
shows no signs of slowing down at any
time soon.
