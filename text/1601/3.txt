The Big Elections 2015: Felix finds out
who you’re voting for
For the first time in its history,
Felix has run an exit poll for
the Big Elections. Now voting
has closed, we can now announce our
predictions for who will be next year’s
sabbatical officers.
Our poll, which was open from
the start of voting until Thursday
evening, asked voters who their
first choice preference was for the
positions of President, the Deputy
Presidents, and Felix Editor.
The number of votes cast has
already passed many of last year’s
milestones. At time of print we had
already beaten the number of voters,
although as there are more students
eligible to vote this year, we are yet to
beat last year’s percentage of 39.31%.
On average, students can vote for
33.6 positions, although 6 people
have 100 or more positions to cast
their vote for. The most number of
positions one poor student has to vote
for is 144.
Respondents were asked what type
of student they are, what gender they
identify as, what year of study they
are in, what their fee status is, and
what department they were from; so
the Felix analysis team could look for
patterns and trends.
Unlike the election itself, which
makes use of the Single Transferrable
Vote system, our poll only asked for
voter’s first preference.
As it is possible for the person
who commanded the greatest share
of the vote from first preferences
to not win the election – this was
seen (for example) last year in the
election for RCSU President – there
is a possibility that the person we
identify as coming first place may
not actually win the election when
subsequent preferences are taken into
consideration.
Additionally, readers are warned
that this poll may not be completely
accurate, as a result of the low number
of responses (150), especially for
certain groups of students (namely
those in the RSM, and postgraduates),
so we warn readers (and candidates)
that the results announced on
Friday night may well differ to our
predictions.
Our predictions are as follows.
For the position of President, Luke
Armitage was selected by 17% of
respondents, Lucinda Sandon-Allum
59%, and RON at 24%, meaning we
predict Lucinda to become next year’s
President. 118 people cast their choice
for this role.
For Deputy President (Finance and
Services), Ali Lown took 22%, Lizzie
Campbell 16%, Christopher Kaye
53%, and RON 9%, 112 people made a
choice for this position.
Meanwhile, for Deputy President
(Welfare), Diba Esbati was chosen by
21%, Jenny Watson 65%, and RON
14%, with 107 responses. Therefore,
we expect Chris to be next year’s
DPFS, and Jenny the DPW.
PHILIP KENT
DEPUTY EDITOR
Two positions which were
uncontested were Deputy President
(Education), where Chun-Yin
San commanded 70% of the 107
responses, and RON 30%; while for
Felix Editor, Grace Rahman took 85%
of the 111 responses and RON 15%.
Chun and Grace are expected to
be next year’s DPW and Felix Editor
respectively.
However, one of the most
interesting cases was Deputy
President (Clubs and Societies), where
Tom Rivlin took 29%, Ben Howitt
47%, and Issy Barrett 15%, leaving
RON with 10%.
Whilst we expect Ben to be next
year’s DPCS based on these results,
whether Tom wins on Friday night
based on second preferences could be
a possibility. 105 people cast a choice
for this position.
Analysis of our demographic
reports showed some interesting
trends. For the position of Deputy
President (Welfare), none of the
people who responded to our poll who
are medics chose Diba Esbati – it is of
note that Jenny Watson is the current
ICSMSU Welfare Officer.
Meanwhile, DPCS candidate
Tom Rivlin enjoyed much greater
popularity from Natural Sciences
students than those from other
faculties according to our poll (Rivlin
is a Physics undergraduate).
When looking at the gender
distribution, people who identified
as female were far less likely to select
Luke Armitage for President, but
also chose RON in slightly larger
numbers.
Lucinda Sandon-Allum was also
chosen more often by female students
than male. Looking at DPCS, Issie
Barrett took nearly double the
number of choices from female
students than male ones. Whilst this
may suggest that people vote along
gender lines, further research would
be needed to confirm this possibility.
Perhaps more interestingly, with
DPFS, Chris Kaye’s popularity
dropped significantly with female
voters, while Ali Lown’s increased.
RON consistently performed better
with older students (bar one hiccup
in the trend with DPW). Candidates
who bucked the trend included Tom
Rivlin (DPCS), Lizzie Campbell
(DPFS), and Ali Lown (DPFS).
Full demographic breakdowns
will be on the Felix website later on
Friday 13th
March, and the actual
results of the Big Elections 2015 will
be announced at the Union’s results
party (Friday 13th, 8PM, Metric) and
online shortly afterwards.
