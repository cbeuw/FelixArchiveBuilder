Antigone: An Atonal, Atypical Astonishment
Juliette Binoche impresses Fred Fyles, in this measured, unique
production of Sophocles’ Antigone
In a recent interview, given to
promote his 2014 production
of Arthur Miller’s A View from
the Bridge, which opened at the
Young Vic to overwhelming critical
acclaim before making the switch to
broadway, Belgian director Ivo van
Hove said “I am not so interested
in good and evil”. Therefore, it
seems that he is an incongruous
choice for director of Sophocles’
Antigone, a classic that so clearly
revolves around ideas of ‘right’ and
‘wrong’. This fact, combined with the
reputation van Hove has obtained
for his radical reinterpretations of
the stalwarts of the theatrical canon,
means that those attending the
Barbican’s production of Antigone
– somewhat of a misnomer; this is
in fact an international production,
with input from French, British,
Luxembourgian, and Dutch
companies – are already expecting
something out of the ordinary.
Combine this with the fact that the
lead role is being taken on by French
actor Juliette Binoche, a legend of
arthouse cinema who has starred in
films by Jean-Luc Godard, Krzysztof
Kieslowski, and Michael Haneke, and
the hype surrounding the production
reaches fever pitch. Of course, this
is only the latest in what seems to
be a new trend of established actors
taking on some of Greek theatre’s
most challenging women; after
Kristin Scott Thomas’ turn in the Old
Vic’s Electra, and Helen McCrory’s
interpretation of woman scorned
in the National Theatre’s Medea, it
seemed that Binoche had a lot to live
up to. This production of Antigone
does not disappoint, although the
effect of van Hove’s direction is
disconcerting; it hits all the right
notes, but plays an atonal tune.
It is Canadian playwright Anne
Carson who has taken on the
challenge of translating the original
Greek text, updating it for a more
modern audience. A high drama,
Antigone centres around the daughter
of Oedipus; cursed by birthright, with
a family “double triple degraded and
dirty in every direction”, Antigone
has had a life of misery and shame
– her mother’s granddaughter, and
her father’s sister, Antigone has
seen her two brothers kill each other
in battle over control of the city-
state of Thebes. The void left has
been filled by her uncle Kreon, who
attempts to establish some kind of
order in the war-torn city through
autocratic rule. His first edict: to bury
Eteocles, the defender of Thebes, and
to leave Polyneikes, who launched
the war, out in the desert, unburied
and unmourned. Defying her uncle,
headstrong Antigone buries the body,
and is therefore condemned to death.
At first sight this seems to be a
straight-cut tale of a tyrant opposed
to humanity, but Carson’s translation
helps reintroduce the ambiguity at
the heart of the play – the interaction
between physis, or natural laws,
and nomos, those laws made by
man. Antigone bluntly refuses to
acknowledge these new laws – “you
call that law... Zeus does not/Justice
does not.” Binoche says these lines,
not with venom, but with a simple
clarity – consigned to her fate, all
she can do is shrug her shoulders.
And yet, Antigone is far from a
sympathetic figure; as unrelenting
as Kreon, she goes towards her death
like a reckless teen. When her sister
Ismene (Kirsty Bushell) tries to share
the responsibility for the burial,
Antigone screams at her “leave my
death alone/you did not lay a hand
on this/you cannot make it yours/
for me to die is altogether adequate”,
to which Ismene can only reply “I’ll
be so lonely”. Antigone also seems
to exhibit Freud’s Death Drive, as
she rushes headlong into the abyss;
fantasising about her coming doom,
she envisions the tomb as a bridal
chamber where she shall ‘marry’ her
brother - “one day we’ll lie together
in the grave he and I side by side/for
death is long”.
Antigone is above all a complex
character, exhibiting both a
challengingly unendearing nature
and an understandable motive for
her actions; Binoche excels, with a
measured, nuanced performance.
A particular highlight of the
translation is the skill with which
Carson has handled the stichomythia,
or alternating single lines. As
Antigone argues with Kreon, the
rhythm of these lines help create an
atmosphere of high tension, driving
forward the drama; not only that, but
they give a chance for Antigone, that
ideal of a headstrong heroine, to show
her cutting wit: “one man rule has
its advantages doesn’t it?” she says;
“you’re the only person in Thebes
who sees things this way”, he replies;
“no actually they all do/but you’ve
nailed their tongues to the floor.”
Such well measured, economical verse
is a highlight in what is an excellent
interpretation of the original text,
something for which Carson should
be applauded.
For those audience members
expecting emotional crescendos and
pummeling pathos, prepare to be let
down. van Hove makes the radical
decision to have the characters speak
their lines in calm, even tones; it robs
the text of its urgency, but somehow
works, conjuring up an atmosphere of
unease reflecting the moral quandary
at the heart of the play. It is as if
someone has sucked the oxygen out
of the room, leaving behind a vacuum
that can only be filled with our
undivided attention. Patrick O’Kane
is especially good in the role of
Kreon, imbuing his tyrant-king with
insecurity and a coldness that only
breaks towards the end of the play,
when his actions have brought about
the destruction of his clan. I believe
that had van Hove made the decision
to play Antigone straight it would
have become just another in a long
line of Greek tragedies, or – worse – a
hammy melodrama.
What also sets this production
apart is the lack of that most
characteristic of features: a chorus.
Instead of having the traditional
group of elderly Greek men, van
Hove lets each actor in turn take on
some of the lines spoken, resulting
in a democratic version of Antigone,
in which one character blurs into
another. The effect is startling, and
it is only when reading the script
that one realises who is supposed
to be saying what. This decision, to
split up what is traditionally seen as
some form of conscious, reflects the
insecurity that lies at the heart of all
of the characters.
That being said, there are some
moments of the play that simply
don’t work: the lines of the guard, for
example, are delivered in such a way
as to try and conjure up a humour
that just doesn’t sit right within the
production; the fact that the actors’
voices are so levelled means that
many have to be mic’ed up, which
completely alters the quality of
sound, and means that the rustling of
clothing is amplified to an annoying
degree. The effect of such things
is to take us out of the moment,
replacing pathos with bathos, and
reminding us that we are – after all –
an audience in a theatre. The reason
that Greek drama has continued to
be meaningful is that it connects
with people throughout history; these
decisions by van Hove make it all the
more difficult to establish this fateful
connection.
Such dramas lend themselves well
to minimalist staging, and Antigone
is no exception: a vast blank space,
with a grave-like depression in the
middle, and a blank circle at the back.
At the beginning of the production,
this circle moves back, revealing a
vast round sun; as the play goes on
the circle slowly revolves round,
suggesting a single continuous series
of events. This, combined with the
music, which is largely minimalist
organ drones, means that we are less
in the ancient palace of Kreon than
in a Philip Glass opera. It definitely
works, allowing all the attention to
be focussed on the actors. However,
some unwelcome additions intrude
on the minimalist setting; black sofas,
typewriters, and shelves of video
cassettes conjure up the atmosphere
of a modern office, something that
seems completely incongruous to
the ethos of the play. The back of the
stage is used as a vast screen, on which
various scenes are projected: desert
landscapes, blurred city scenes, and
Antigone’s lifeless body. It wouldn’t
be a van Hove production without
some kind of modern technology, but
– bar one point at the end of the play
– it never intrudes on the action.
If this production of Antigone is
remembered for one thing it will
not be for Juliette Binoche’s sterling
performance, nor Ivo van Hove’s
radical interpretation, but for the
stunning new translation from
Anne Carson, who handles the text
with delicacy and wit. This play is
urgent; it quietly demands to be seen,
stealing your attention for the entire
100-minute run. A different take
on a classic, van Hove’s production
is disquietingly enjoyable, and
unnervingly excellent.
Antigone is on at the Barbican
Centre until 28th
March. Tickets
from £16; Young Barbican tickets
available.
