Interviews with the captains
The Rugby Showdown: Men
How has your season gone so far?
Considering the 2 month ban and
the fact the team have been relegated,
there have been some very good
results in the second term. A win at
Varsity would be a great way to end a
very disjointed season.
How much does this match mean
to your team?
Just as much as any other league
game really. There is the added
incentive to get one over on the
Medics, however it will be approached
just like any other game.
How much will last week’s result
between you both have a bearing
on next week?
You can’t relate the two games,
not only is it a completely different
environment, the teams will also be
very different.
Which game do you consider more
important to your season – The
Stoop or the League?
At the end of the day next
Wednesday is just another league
game, so both are just as important as
each other.
How much are you looking forward
to playing at The Stoop?
The support is what makes it such a
special occasion and the whole team
are looking forward to the evening.
Also, the post-match food at The
Stoop is pretty good.
Where will this game be won and
lost?
Based on previous matches between
the two teams, the forwards will play
a huge part. So winning the battle up
front I think will be a huge factor in
determining who comes out on top.
Prediction for the game?
It’s a tough one to call, it’ll
definitely be a closely contested
match. However, I have every
confidence in my players to deliver
on the day and come out on top.
James Cox, 1st XV College Captain
"I have
every
confidence
in my
players to
deliver on
the day."
How has your season gone so far?
This season has certainly been an
interesting one, from some absolutely
smashing phases and cracking games
to some disheartening losses. Overall
though, we have seen some figures
really stand out and embody the
club’s mentality and I think we have
a great foundation to build on in the
future.
How much does this match mean
to your team?
Needless to say, this game is always
hugely anticipated and this year is no
different.
How much will last week’s result
between you both have a bearing
on next week?
Last week was a good match to
watch and saw a lot of potential from
both sides. It also highlighted where
we need to work on to shutdown
Imperial’s style of play.
Which game do you consider more
important to your season – The
Stoop or the League?
As important as the league is to us,
there’s nothing quite like playing
against IC at The Stoop. I certainly
will be waking up on Varsity and
having a lovely bubble bath just to
calm the nerves.
How much are you looking forward
to playing at The Stoop?
Although the Stoop lacks Heston’s
invigorating and lively spirit it still
draws a thrilling atmosphere and is
a great venue for this archaic grudge
match.
Where will this game be won and
lost?
In the end, the game will be decided
by whoever scores more points.
Prediction for the game?
A lot of rugby will be played and
whoever runs with the confidence will
shatter the opposition’s defence.

Interviews with the captains
How has your season gone so far?
Women’s rugby at Imperial has
gone from strength to strength this
year. We enjoyed one of the biggest
fresher intakes we have ever had
and this has enabled us to build the
foundations of a superb team.
Does playing against people you
normally play with add an edge to
the game?
Yes, playing against people who are
normally our team mates means that
we have all had to significantly up our
game. We will be bringing an element
of surprise to the pitch!
Has there been any specific
preparation for this game in
addition to normal training?
Yes, there have been additional
training sessions for both teams with
separate coaches. This will ensure we
are all on our A game at Stoop.
How much are you looking forward
to playing at the Stoop?
It is a fantastic opportunity to play
at the home of the Harlequins and we
are all extremely excited about being
given this opportunity.
Where will this game be won and
lost?
Je ne comprends pas…
Prediction for the game?
Well I’m not going to predict that
we are going to lose am I?

The Rugby Showdown: Women
How has your season gone so far?
It’s been a bumpy season truth
be told, having lost a lot of senior
players at the end of last year we
took a slight knock to our winning
streaks. However we’ve had a massive
intake of very talented and promising
freshers who have showcased their
skills well in matches. This has left us
high in the London League.
Does playing against people you
normally play with add an edge to
the game?
Definitely. There’s a good level of
banter between us and the other team,
and I’m sure knowing their players’
strengths and weaknesses as well as
our own will help us play strategically
to our advantage.
Has there been any specific
preparation for this game in
addition to normal training?
That would be telling… Yes… but the
other team will probably read this so
we’re giving nothing away.
How much are you looking forward
to playing at the Stoop?
SO SO MUCH! It’s a big thing for us
obviously, playing high level rugby
at a famous ground is any young
players dream. Even playing in front
of a crowd will be exciting and a first
for most of our team. But on top of
this, for a women’s sport to be the
headline act at varsity for the first
time is a huge step forward for sport
at imperial. We’re hoping watching
our game will not only raise the
profile of women’s rugby, but inspire
more women at Imperial to take part
in sport!
Where will this game be won and
lost?
Definitely rucks and Wings. IC has
a forward heavy team whereas we
have a higher proportion of backs.
In this 10s game our stamina will
be under scrutiny, so we will have to
work hard to continue clearing out
the rucks and making the crucial
runs for the line.
Prediction for the game?
Tricky, it’s all to play for. I think
it’ll be close but our experience
and intensive training regimes will
support us to victory. Watch and see
– it’s certainly not going to be a dull
game.
"It's
certainly
not going
to be a dull
game."
Words from the club captain
Women’s rugby playing at The Stoop for
this year’s varsity is an interesting change to
normal tradition.Although the men will still
be playing their match,it will be followed up
by a 40 minute 10s match from the women.
Most of our matches are only ever
witnessed by whatever subs we manage to
pull together and the odd parent,so this is a
new experience for us.
Needless to say,with only a week to go,
nerves are starting to kick in.However these
are slightly lessened by the knowledge that
everyone in the stands will have had a bit
to drink and they’ll be too far away for us to
make out any heckling.
But seriously,don’t heckle.Rude.All in all,it
should be a fun night and hopefully it’ll show
everyone that rugby is a women’s sport too.
