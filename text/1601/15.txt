Imperial’s fashionistas of the week: meet Corinna, John, Laura and Bilal
Meet Corinna Lamberti, a
4th
year Biochemistry with
Management student.
This stylish Italian lady channels
understated chic in all her looks,
citing vogue and Pinterest as some
of her obvious sources of fashion
inspiration. She also gets her
inspiration from lookbook, a popular
fashion blogging community where
people from all over the world upload
picture of themselves wearing their
favourite outfits.
Being from Italy, Corinna’s syle has
a distinctly European feel to it, often
feauturing darker, muted colours.
Some of her fashion icons include
British models Cara Delevingne, Kate
Moss and famous art collector Peggy
Guggenheim. Corinna has a weakness
for french designers, listing Celine,
Lanvin and Isabel Marant as some of
her favourite labels.
Corinna herself describes her style
as European and minimalistic, with
a particular penchant for statement
jewellery. By combining high end
and high street pieces, she looks
effortlessly stylish and put together.
John Ferguson is a 2nd
year
mechanical engineering
Scotsman from Dundee. You
can usually spot him in the CGCU
building wearing an ultra suave suit
or waiscoast. This time however, I
caught him on one of his more smart
casual days. John takes pride in the
clothes he wears, preferring to blow
his student loan on nice clothes
instead of unnecessary things like
smart phones (he still walks around
with a pre-historic brick phone.)
However, what he lacks in portable
tech, he more than makes up for in
bringing it in fashion stakes.
John cites the popular men’s
fashion magazine GQ as a source of
his fashion inspiration, as well as
movies (probably James Bond). After
pressing him for a particular fashion
icon, he mentions that he loves Eddie
Redmayne’s fashion sense. I don’t
blame him; Eddie Redmayne is a fine
man indeed!
Describing his style as “classic” and
“dapper”, it’s not surprising that he
chooses to shop at places like Reiss,
Suit Supply, Hugo Boss and All Saints.
When he’s feeling more high street,
John’s go-to store is always Uniqlo.

Laura De Arroyo Garcia (what
a mouthful) is a Spanish
student studying Biochemistry
with Management. She describes
her style as preppy, and gets her
inspiration from ready to wear
fashion collections and Instagram
fashionistas, particularly Spanish
ones (of course).
Being Spanish, Laura loves a bit of
Zara. Combining affordable fashion
with high end looks, the brand is a
fashion sensation for good reason.
Zara is practically an institution in
Spain anyway, so you’ll rarely come
across a Spaniard who doesn’t love
the brand. Laura also loves high end
brands Yves Saint Laurent, Cavalli
and Armani. She swears by Cavalli
skinny jeans. They’re the only jeans
she ever goes for because they give
“the best fit”.
The former IC cheerleader and
gymnast often pairs her looks with
signature knee high boots, instantly
and effortlessly dressing up any look.
Laura’s also very into jewellery, which
is always important when one wants
to ‘girlify’ a look. So what are her
go-to pieces of choice? Usually a pearl
necklace with an ‘L’ pendant letter
for her name. Oh, and her Rolex, of
course!
Cécile Borkhataria searches for the best dressed ladies and gents on campus, digging deep into where they get their fashion inspiration from
At first, Bilal Abou El Ela was
slightly apprehensive about
featuring in the spread,
but after some convincing, the
temptation to appear in Felix was all
but too much.
Bilal’s not your traditional
fashionista; it’s all-natural for him.
When it comes to where he gets his
inspiration from, he insists that he
doesn’t get his inspiration from any
online sources, blogs or websites.
Instead, he believes his style has been
distinctly influenced by growing up
in Spain.
He likes to wear light, colourful and
summery outfits. His put-together,
smart look is classically Spanish.
When I asked him about his fashion
icons, he couldn’t think of a single
guy. After some thought though,
he responded with, possibly, the
most unique answer I’ve heard yet:
his father. Bilal channels his dad’s
Spanish fashion sense. And isn’t that
the best gift a parent can give?
If you want to look as cool as Bilal,
look no further than Spanish retailer
Massimo Dutti. He says they’re the
best for trousers. For jumpers, Bilal
goes to preppy retailer Gant (the
closest one to IC is next to Harrods).
Not surprisingly, Bilal also loves
Hugo Boss, and everything else that’s
stylish and “not too flashy”.
Pandora bracelets have been a
fashion sensation since 2003. The
concept is simple: buy a plain charm
bracelet, and buy and accumulate
charms gradually. Eventually, you’ll
end up with a bracelet loaded with
charms!
