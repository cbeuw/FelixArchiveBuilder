This week, as part of the
Women@Imperial project,
the College played host to a
number of events celebrating past and
present female staff and students of
Imperial in honour of International
Women’s Day.
The central focus of the project is
the public exhibition of photographs,
video content and archive material
taking place in the College Main
Entrance from 9th
to 13th
March.
Future events include a series of
briefings by female postdoctoral
alumni and the Annual Athena
lecture given by President of the
Royal Academy of Engineering
Professor Dame Ann Dowling on 17th
June 2015.
This week, Imperial College Union
hosted an event on Thursday evening
entitled “A Catalyst for Change”; a
number of student groups including
Empower, WSET, Feminist Society
and Tandem took part in the
discussion about key issues faced
by women in Science, Technology,
Engineering and Medicine (STEM).
The discussion covered topics
including the skills required to
succeed as a woman in scientific
research, the effectiveness of
mentoring, feminism in a male
dominated environment and what
more can be done to support women
as leaders in STEM fields.
Other events this week also included
a lunchtime careers talk from The
Sky At Night presenter and Imperial
alumnus Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock
MBE on Thursday 12th
March.
The main exhibition in the College
Main Entrance featured photography
and archive material, illustrating
the stories of a number of important
female historical figures in Imperial’s
history alongside present staff.
Women featured included Helen
Kemp Porter, a plant physiologist
who was the first woman Professor at
Imperial; Martha Annie Whitely, the
first woman to join the teaching staff
of the Royal College of Science and
the first woman Assistant Professor
at Imperial; and Letitia Chitty,
the first woman to graduate from
Cambridge with first class honours
in the Mechanical Sciences Tripos
who joined Imperial as a Research
Assistant in 1934.
Researchers from Imperial’s more
recent history included Dr Rebecca
Bell, a research fellow from the
Department of Earth Science and E

Professor and Senior Research
Investigator in the Department of
Chemical Engineering.
Imperial’s 19 current female
Fellows of the Royal Society,
Royal Academy of Engineering,
the Academy of Medical Sciences
and the British Academy were also
celebrated. Alongside them were
displays highlighting the Academic
Women’s Ambassadors, posts created
in 2008 to support fellow academics
in professional development and
recommend tutoring and mentoring
facilities.
Other exhibits also explored
the College’s schemes to bring
about more equal representation
of women as students, faculty
members, entrepreneurs and leaders,
including the Elsie Widdowson
Fellowship Awards and the Julia
Higgins Medal and Awards, which
are awarded annually to recognise
the contributions of both individuals
and departments to the support of
academic women at the College.
Finally the exhibition celebrated
the initiatives developed by current
and former female students with
informative displays on groups
including Women in SET, Feminist
Society and Empower.
There was also a video exhibit,
which compiled clips of Imperial
students sharing the stories of women
who had inspired them and developed
their interest in science. Many of
the students featured describe how
female teachers, family members
and public figures influenced their
decision to study STEM subjects.
In tandem with the larger
exhibition, the Wolfson Café on
Hammersmith Campus hosted a
satellite exhibition of 12 panels of
photographs showcasing leading
female scientists from Imperial’s
history.
A panel of staff and students also
took part in a Google Hangout at 1pm
on Wednesday 11th
March to discuss
both the week’s events and the wider
campaign. The event was chaired
by Kerry Noble, News Editor in the
Communications and Public Affairs
Division, and featured women from a
variety of Imperial departments and
groups.
Taking questions from social
media channels using the hashtag
#ImperialWomen, the participants
shared their experiences as women at
Imperial, discussing the importance
of role models and the women who
they have personally been inspired
by.
On the evening of Tuesday 10th
March the College hosted a launch
event for the exhibition, which was
attended by around 200 members
of the Imperial community and
special guests including the Mayor
of the Royal Borough of Kensington
and Chelsea, Maighread Condon-
Simmonds.
The event was opened by Professor
Dorothy Griffiths, the Provost’s
Envoy for Gender Equality, who first
joined Imperial in 1969 and was a
founding member of the UK’s first
ever Women In Science Group.
President of Imperial College
Professor Alice Gast welcomed the
attendees and gave a short speech
praising the Women@Imperial
project, before introducing College
Provost Professor James Stirling.
As chair of the Academic Gender
Strategy Committee, Professor
Stirling spoke about the support
available for female staff and
students, including the Athena
SWAN Charter and current
initiatives to improve emergency
childcare provisions and host family
life panel discussions.
Noting that women make up 36%
of the student population at Imperial
but only 19% of professors, Professor
Stirling expressed his regret that the
“leaky pipeline” effect for women
in STEM fields had not yet been
eradicated. He noted that while there
was “much to celebrate”, there was
also much still to be done in terms of
gender parity.

Last to speak was Union President
Tom Wheeler, who communicated
the Union’s desire to empower
students to take the lead in fixing
the problems they face, thanking
the Liberation Officers for their
assistance in this.
Wheeler also spoke about the
student-led ICSexism campaign,
which aims to collect students’
experiences and get people talking
about the issue of sexism on campus.
A performance from the A Cappella
society’s first all-female group, the
Imperielles, followed the speeches.
Throughout the evening a number
of groups manned Imperial Fringe
style interactive exhibits featuring
demonstrations and displays of
recent research performed by women
at Imperial.
Imperial College Business School
took the opportunity to announce
two new scholarships, worth
£20,000 each, for exceptional female
candidates seeking to undertake
Imperial’s Executive MBA. The
initiative hopes to encourage more
women to undertake post-graduate
management education.
Women@Imperial comprises a
series of events taking place through
to June 2015, honouring academic
and professional women of the
College and raising awareness of the
variety of schemes run by College to
support women’s careers.
Imperial College London has
released its first annual report on
animal research practices within
College. The 30-page document was
launched at a specially held event as
part of the Imperial Fringe series,
which was open to the public and
drew a crowd of around 200.
Attendees had the opportunity
to chat with a number of vets and
technicians involved in Imperial’s
animal research, along with checking
out exhibits demonstrating College’s
efforts in reducing, replacing and
refining the use of animals in science.
One such exhibit showcased the use
of heart cells produced from human
stem cells, touted as an alternative
to animal testing in order to study
the efficacy of treatments for heart
conditions.
Some exhibits also served to
demonstrate why animal testing is
still needed in the research process
to improve both human and animal
health.
The event was preceded by a series
of talks targeted those working in or
funding animal research, which drew
a 100-strong crowd of representatives
from 30 different organizations.
Professor James Stirling, Provost
of Imperial College London, gave
this statement: “These events and
the publication of the animal
research annual report are extremely
important milestones for the College.
“It’s pleasing to have so much to say
about how we carry out research at
Imperial and how we are building on
our strengths in animal welfare and
the 3Rs to become a world-leader in
this area.
“In particular, I am proud to see
technicians, vets, scientists and
communications staff working
together as a community to help us
meet our commitment to being more
open about animal research”.
In the report, he is also quoted as
saying: “2014 was a year of significant
positive change for Imperial. We
have carried out a major restructure
of the way we govern and support our
animal research work at the College,
and reviewed the culture of care for
our animals.
The benefits of these changes are
already being seen and I am certain
that we will make substantial further
progress in 2015”.
The report is College’s latest effort
following a number of comments
and allegations on its animal testing
practices, which have been made
over the past few years chiefly by the

British Union for the Abolition of
Vivisection (BUAV).
In 2012, the BUAV conducted an
undercover investigation at Imperial,
subsequently publishing a damning
report and graphic video footage
during Easter 2013.
College then ordered an
independent academic inquiry into
its culture and approach to animal
care and welfare, which began in
July that year and was chaired
by Professor Steve Brown from

Imperial alumnus Sir Philip
Dilley will take over as Chair of
Imperial’s governing Council
this May. The leading engineer and
businessman will succeed Baroness
Manningham-Buller, who has been in
the role since July 2011.
A member of Council for the last
four years, Sir Philip will be the 12th
Chair of the governing and executive
body and the first Imperial alumnus
to take on the role. He has been
initially appointed for a four-year
term starting on 18th May 2015.
After graduating with a First in
Civil Engineering in 1976, Sir Philip
left Imperial for a successful career
in engineering within Arup Group.
He rose through the ranks to become
Executive Chairman in 2009, leaving
the post in September 2014 to take
up the position of Chairman of the
Environment Agency.
“We are immensely fortunate to
benefit from Sir Philip’s talents and
expertise” said President of Imperial
College Professor Alice Gast. “He will
be a great leader and I am looking
forward to working with him”.
In a statement, Sir Philip said “It is
a great honour to be asked to Chair
Imperial’s Council and I am delighted
that I will be able to serve the College
as its Chair at such an exciting time in
its development.”
“We owe Eliza Manningham-Buller
a huge thank you for her service
in leading the Council with such
wisdom, clarity of thought, and with
such strong advocacy for Imperial’s
mission, relevance and impact in the
world today”.

The Brown Report, released in
December 2013, stated that while the
inquiry panel found staff at College
to be committed to animal welfare,
there were a number of concerns
regarding conduct, management and
oversight of animal research within
College.
The panel had thus provided
recommendations on Imperial’s
working policies and processes;
subsequently, College signed the
Concordat on Openness on Animal
Gast thanked her for all she has
contributed to Imperial in her time
serving on Council: “I have been most
impressed with Eliza’s leadership
of such a talented and dedicated
Council. She has been wonderful
to work with and has left a lasting
imprint on the College, the Council
and our leadership team”.
Baroness Manningham-Buller said
“I am sad to be leaving Imperial as it
is a fascinating place, bursting with
outstanding people and exciting
ideas. It has been most rewarding
to be involved with such a great
university, and I feel privileged to
have chaired its Council and Court
since 2011.
“I am delighted that Philip is my
successor. I think the College has
made an excellent choice and that it
will continue to thrive and develop
under his chairmanship. I shall
always value the friendships I have
made in the College”.

a number of commitments to
transparency and communication in
its animal research practices.
The Home Office also launched its
own investigation, later declaring
in October 2014 that the BUAV’s
allegations of widespread animal
abuse and cruelty at Imperial were
“[not having] been substantiated”.
Only 5 out of the 180 allegations
made were upheld, with the 5 being
classified as “minor non-compliance
technical cases”.
