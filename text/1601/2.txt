me were worth it; I love my job and
will be sad to pass the gauntlet on to
someone else. Luckily I personally
think the candidate running is very
competent, a lot of fun and also so
much cooler than I, so I know Felix
will be in good hands when I up and
leave.
Also, as an *ahem* older student
now, my Facebook feed isn’t as highly
populated with election posts, events
and statuses as it used to be. There
is light at the end of the tunnel, I
promise you.
It has been fun to watch the
elections from afar though, and
would genuinely like to say Luke has
ran the most hilarious, if not slightly
bizarre election I’ve seen since I’ve
been here. I do think students should
enjoy campaigning and not take it
too seriously, and remember that it is
not the be all and end all if the results
don’t turn out as you would like.
Speaking of results, we’ve also ran

This week in Felix we have a
mixture of happy and also very sad
news.
We are extremely sad to run the
story on the death of the first year
student Georg Zänker, who passed
away last Saturday. The passing of
a student is always difficult to deal
with, and if you are affected by our
coverage, please do consult our
welfare pages for a list of helplines
and contacts that are more than
happy to talk to you and provide any
help that you need.
In happier news, the elections
are finally at an end. As someone
who has run in not one, but two Big
Elections as a sabbatical candidate, I
can tell you honestly it is completely
exhausting to run around campus,
throwing sweets in the faces of
students you don’t know and
pretending to be so cheerful and
happy for two whole weeks.
As much as I love Felix, being editor
and campaigning to become editor
are two very different things, and
require different levels of strength
and determination. Those two weeks
I spent harassing students to vote for
an exit poll for the first time ever
this year, to find out who you are
voting for and why. Although the
turnout for the poll isn’t as high as
other surveys we run (*cough* our sex
survey, which is still open by the way
*cough*) it was filled in by enough
people to get a bit of a feel for how
results may turn out tonight for the
sabbatical positions.
Last year, a poll ran by The Tab
for the role of Union President
was actually incredibly close to the
real-life outcome, so who knows?
Saying that, we do have less contested
positions then last year, so many
of the predictions aren’t really
surprising considering it is either a
fairly competent candidate running
against RON.
Anyway, by the time you are
reading this, campaigning and voting
would have closed and the decision
will already be out of your hands.
Look out for the results tonight on
our twitter feed and the Union twitter
feed, or come along to the party in
Metric later on tonight if you fancy
watching everything unfold for
yourself.
