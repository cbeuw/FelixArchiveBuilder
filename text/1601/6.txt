Avideo of Abubakar Shekau,
the leader of the militant
extremist group Boko Haram,
has emerged in which he swears
allegiance to Islamic State (IS).
The message said: “We announce
our allegiance to the Caliph of the
Muslims and will hear and obey in
times of difficulty and prosperity,
in hardship and ease, and to endure
being discriminated against, and
not to dispute about rule with those
in power, except in case of evident
infidelity regarding that which there
is a proof from Allah”.
The Boko Haram leader
purportedly goes on to say “We call
on Muslims everywhere to pledge
allegiance to the caliph”.
The Arabic audio message, which
has not yet been verified, was posted
on Boko Haram’s Twitter account
on Saturday 7th
March. Boko Haram
previously expressed support for the
Islamic State in 2014 and, if verified,
this pledge by the Nigeria based
extremist group would be the latest in
a series of allegiances sworn to IS by
radical military organisations.
After its founding in 2002, Boko
Haram’s increasing radicalisation led
to a violent uprising in July 2009 in
which its founder and then leader,
Mohammed Yusuf, was executed.
The group’s subsequent six-year
military campaign after the uprising
of 2009 has been so extreme that
al-Qaida’s leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri,
has renounced Boko Haram’s actions.
Since Abubakar Shekau’s
appointment as leader the group
has killed over 5,000 civilians and
more than 1.5 million people have
been displaced as they fled from the
conflict zone.
Boko Haram gained widespread
media attention in April of last year
after the kidnapping of 276 Nigerian
schoolgirls from the northeasterly
region of Chibok.
Many of the mainly Christian
students who were abducted in April
have been forced to convert to Islam
and marry members of Boko Haram,
reportedly being sold for a “bride
price” of just 2,000 Nigerian naira
(less than £7.00).
In May 2014, Abubakar Shekau
took responsibility for the
abductions, claiming that “Allah
instructed me to sell them,”
and saying “I will carry out his
instructions”. He has said the girls
should not have been in school and
instead should have been married.
The announcement of Boko
Haram’s pledge of allegiance to
Islamic State was posted online
shortly after female suicide
bombers killed at least 50 people in
the northeastern Nigerian city of
Maiduguri, which is in the Borno
state where Boko Haram originated.
Boko Haram advocates for a strict
form of sharia law to be imposed
in their claimed territory and is
prepared to kill anyone who does not
conform to their ultraconservative
fundamentalist form of Sunni Islam,
known as Wahhabism.

conservative Islamic traditions

and the caliphs (leaders) involved
are seen by the membership as
political successors to the prophet
Mohammad. The name “boko haram”
is often translated as “Western
education is forbidden”.
The group, which is believed to be
10,000 strong, is currently operating
in Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger and
Chad. Together with Islamic State,
Boko Haram intends to take over
as much land as possible in order to
spread their ideology.
What is the Islamic State?
Formerly known as The Islamic
State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS),or The
Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant
(ISIL),Islamic State (IS) is the
name given to the fundamentalist
rebel terrorist group that controls
territory in north-western Iraq
and northern Syria,along with
operations in several other
countries in North Africa and the
Middle East.
Until recently,Islamic State went
by the name of ISIS,which many
Western leaders (including David
Cameron and Barack Obama)
would refer to as ISIL.‘The Levant’
is an undefined region around the
Middle East,which was a preferred
term since Western governments
were very reluctant to declare a
war in Syria.
In June of 2014 the radicalised
militant group announced that
they were going to drop the last
two letters of their acronym and
call themselves Islamic State.
Despite Islamic State not being
what the majority of Muslims
believe to be‘Islamic’,nor a state,
this rebrand made it clear that
the organisation sees itself as a
worldwide caliphate,not just a
regional one.
Islamic State now recruits from
around the globe,including the
United Kingdom.One particularly
harrowing example is the
radicalisation of University of
Westminster computer science
graduate Mohammed Emwazi,who
was recently unmasked in reports
as the British ISIS militant who
appeared in videos showing the
beheading of journalists and aid
workers in Syria.
Emwazi,who is sometimes
referred to as‘Jihadi John’,had
been known to MI5 and was on the
Home Office Warnings Index,which
prevented him leaving the country.
He is believed to have escaped from
Britain in early 2013 by hiding in
a freight lorry on a Channel ferry,
before travelling on to Turkey and
then Syria.
In the last few days Emwazi has
apologised for the problems he has
caused his family,but not for the
execution of several ISIS captives
including British aid workers David
Haines and Alan Henning.
The apology,which was sent via a
third party from Syria to his family,
expressed remorse for the“problems
and trouble the revelation of his
identity has caused”.Emwazi’s
family has been forced into hiding
ever since his identification.

The group have produced countless
propaganda videos and are well
funded through various sources,
reported to include kidnappings,
robberies, extortion, drug trafficking,
smuggling, poaching and donations
from Islamist sympathisers,
including other jihadist movements.
Boko Haram are an organised
and ambitious group who have
committed truly unthinkable acts
against humanity and pose an even
greater threat to millions of civilians
after their pledge of allegiance to IS.
The jihadist campaign is now being
fought across two continents, and
officials in Washington have called
Islamic State “probably the best-
funded terrorist organisation” the US
has ever confronted.
The group is believed to be
bankrolled to the tune of around one
million dollars a day through wealthy
private donors in the Middle East and
the sale of oil from fields in Syria and
Iraq.
