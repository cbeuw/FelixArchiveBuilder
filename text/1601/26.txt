Travel is the only thing you
can buy that would make you
richer – there’s no denying
that visiting a place in person brings
history to life in a way that words
never can.
What better way to get to know a
place and its culture than to take part
in a festival? With over 6,500 spoken
languages, 194 countries spread over
seven continents; the world is a large
place with countless cultures each with
their own heritage and traditions. Some
of these heritages and traditions have
evolved into large scale celebrations
known as festivals today.
From mating festivals in Africa
to making a wish to the heavens in
Taiwan, I will attempt to bring you
around the world with 19 festivals.
Some have deep cultural roots, or
religious purposes whilst some are a
celebration of music and dancing. The
list is only a corner of the iceberg and
more of a bucket list of my own, but
hopefully reading about them will
inspire you to travel.
