Introducing the new Union campaign
to address mental health issues
Bethany Davison introduces Mentality, looking to help
students struggling
Mental health is something
you probably don’t think
about too much. You
get on with your life and it seems
that the people around you do too.
However, you don’t have to dig very
deep to find that many students are
struggling. It can be very difficult to
know if a friend is struggling with
their mental health.
This year, myself and a group
of other students have started
Mentality, a campaign focussed on
improving the state of mental health
at Imperial through challenging
stigma, raising awareness, improving
services and helping to guide students
to the help they need.
Since forming Mentality, I have
become acutely aware of mental
health at Imperial. I am now so much
more aware of the size of the problem
and I have heard countless stories,
some good and some bad, about
how students have been treated by
college when they have been in times
of greatest need. Any of you who are
fans of the Facebook page ‘Imperial
College Secrets’ will know what I’m
talking about because between the
comedic anecdotes and, frankly
bizarre, stories, you will have seen the
desperate pleas for help of those who
have nowhere else to turn.
Having experienced depression
myself, I know the fear of admitting
to others that you’re not doing
well. You blame yourself for being
depressed and criticise yourself for
being too weak to make yourself
better. Unfortunately, having a
mental health condition skews your
view of the world, rational thoughts
are dismissed and the irrational takes
over; it seems you are alone, that
nobody cares.
It is incredibly hard to see the truth.
Depression or any other mental
health condition are illnesses just like
any other and like any other illness;
you require treatment and help to get
better.
This feeling of isolation is why
I decided to create Mentality. No
one should have to go through
what I suffered. No one deserves to
go through a mental illness alone.
What they do deserve is compassion
and understanding. This is what
Mentality is for, above all else. We
exist because we care about you and
I’m not just saying that, we really do.
We are here as your peers and your
equals and we will help you to find
yourself again.
To be able to provide the most
effective support we need to know
more about the average student
experience at Imperial. To do this we
are running a survey. The outcome of
our survey will also determine what
we choose to campaign about; we
want to tackle the pressing issues that
affect the most students. This could
be access to services but it could also

take the form of changing student
opinion if we find that there is a
recurring reason why students don’t
seek help. Furthermore, we want to
gauge what students know about the
welfare services already in place at
Imperial. You may never have had a
mental health condition, and I hope
you never do, but if things did start
to go wrong, would you know who to
turn to?
I hope this article has made you
think more about mental health, of
the problems that exist and also of
your own mental health. Our minds
are incredible things, so please look
after them.

Campaigns are all about change,be that
within in the Imperial community or
further afield; and it’s easier than you
might think to start one.All you need
is a good idea and enthusiasm.Current
campaigns at Imperial range from such
subjects as sexism and volunteering to
divesting from fossil fuels and mental
health.Once you’ve formed your idea,
you can submit to the Union and,if it
gets approved by the Community and
Welfare Board,they will be able to
help you with your campaign.You will
be given a webpage in the Campaigns
section on the Union website and you’ll
be able to make full use of the Union’s
social media outlets to advertise your
campaign and get more support.
Furthermore,each campaign can apply
for funding of up to £400 for events,
publicity or anything else you can think
of!
I’ve had a really great time being the
campaign leader of Mentality and I’ve
had excellent support every step of the
way from the Union.So,if you’ve got a
subject you’re passionate about,then
why not take the next step and lead your
own campaign!
