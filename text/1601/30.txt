Festival Hopping
There is probably a festival for
every month, if not every day
of the year if one were to scour
through the Earth looking for it, but
in truth many major festivals tend to
clash.
A good example would be February,
with Mardi Gras, Rio and Venice
Mask festival all taking place over
Lent, as well as the Lantern Festival
in Taiwan which takes place over
Chinese New Year.
Well, here’s your chance! Forget
about your friends’ stereotypical gap
years around Thailand or Australia
and take on this new travel challenge:
festival hopping! Because everyone in
Imperial deserves a break. Here are
some suggested itineraries.
The summer festival hop
Start off with Galungan Festival in
Bali on 15th
July, then head to Kyoto
to enjoy the rest of Gion Matsuri for
the rest of July. You then have three
weeks to explore SE Asia before you
fly to Spain for La Tomatia. Give
yourself a month to wander across the
Mediterranean Sea before joining a
tour to witness the ancient Gerewol
festival in Niger before it’s time to
return to Imperial in October.
Spring parties haul
For the life and soul of this world
who wants to take a break before
committing for a career, pick your
poison and start off either at Rio
de Janeiro, Venice or New Orleans.
After celebrating Lent in style during
February, make sure you make
your way to India in March for the
colourful Holi festival. You then have
roughly a month before Coachella
starts in the party capital Las Vegas,
where you are free to stay for live
or carry on road-tripping through
America.
Southern Hemisphere Run
What would life be like down under?
Start your journey by easing yourself
in Indonesia’s Gawai Dayak festival
and immersing yourself in the Dakay
people’s harvest ritual on 1st
June.
Then head to Peru and experience
the festival of the sun – Inti Raymi
on Southern Hemisphere’s winter
solstice. You can end your journey
here or travel through South America
for two months (or drop by Bali for
Galungan in July) before heading to
Argentina for the free Tango festival.
Of course, the above itineraries are
merely my fantasy and a suggestion;
however, with the amount of people
going on round-the-world trips,
making world famous festivals
the focus doesn’t sound that bad.
Whether you want to hop for two,
three or twenty festivals over a
month, two months or a year, here are
a few tips to help you plan the journey
of your life.
Flights
Most of you would probably
immediately type in Skyscanner’s
website, or Easyjet and Ryanair, but
for multi-stop or long haul tickets
STA Travel is probably the best deal
there is to find. With a price beat
guarantee and £49 deposit to secure
flights, it’s the ultimate student travel
company. Sample itineraries such as
The Big Boomerang fly you across
Europe, Asia, Australia and America
through 11 stops for £1,399 and you
are free to create your own itinerary!
For those who are still sceptical
about the price – my sister recently
booked her return tickets to LA after
researching for days and saved £30.
And for people who always change
their mind, they have a Multiflex
pass from £29 to £99 allowing you to
change flights from 1 to unlimited
times.

Accommodation
For those with low budgets,
hostelworld is a good place to look,
although you should look through the
reviews and rating before choosing a
place to stay. For those who want to
live like a local, Airbnb offers rooms
for all budgets.
Alternatively, for the more web
savvy A-listers who want an en-
suite, Voyageprive can offer luxury
accommodation for a good price
– although it’s usually based on two
sharing. Otherwise, Hotel.com gives
you a free night every ten nights you
book.
