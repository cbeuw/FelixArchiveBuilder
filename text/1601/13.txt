Indira Mallik takes a tour of artistic history at the National Gallery
The Grand Master of Impressionism
It’s not often that exhibitions
are staged in celebration of
art collectors. Perhaps it feels
more like honouring the monetary
value of the work than its impact,
but Inventing Impressionism at
the National Gallery shows how
focussing on the collector can
sometimes be a stroke of genius. The
exhibition showcases the work of
Renoir, Monet, and Degas amongst
others through the life of Paul
Durand-Ruel, a French art collector
who is credited with championing
the work of the Impressionists when
contemporary reviews were mostly
hostile.
We are introduced to the man
himself at the opening room of the
exhibition in a simulacrum of his
drawing room. Displayed around a
large black and white photograph of
his drawing room are the paintings
that hung there: Renoir, Monet,
Cassat; a Rodin sculpture sits on
the mantelpiece; a few chandeliers
and Louis XIV chairs are thrown in
for good measure. Presiding over it
all is a likeness of Durand-Ruel by
Renoir, whose rendering is unusually
subdued, made up entirely in a palette
of umbers and burnt siennas. A door
with inlaid panels is also exhibited
– made remarkable by the fact that
they were decorated by Monet with
small paintings of chrysanthemums
and apples. Durand-Ruel wanted to
show clients that they could display
art in the unlikeliest of places.
Through the exhibition the image
of Paul Durand-Ruel emerges
not so much as the inventor of
Impressionism, but as the inventor of
the modern art world we know today.
As a proto-modern art dealer he
threw lavish parties, bought paintings
for many times the average annual
wage of a Frenchman of the time, and
sometimes bought back the paintings
that he thought had sold for too low
a price. He was a shrewd business
man; when the paintings by the ‘new
painters’ didn’t sell in his galleries,
he invited clients to his home to see
how stunning the paintings would
look in a domestic setting. He set out
to conquer international territory
too; with the Paris and London scenes
exhausted, he exhibited paintings in
America, which saw the popularity
and the fortune of Monet grow.
Durand-Ruel made his fortune
selling paintings by the more
established Courbet and Delacroix
and well as works from the Barbizon
school such as those of Charles-
François Daubigny. Duabigny’s
technique of painting outdoors
had led him to make Monet’s
acquaintance; it was through Monet
that Durand-Ruel met Pissarro.
The works of all three painters are
exhibited alongside each other
which highlights not only Durand
Ruel’s journey as a collector, but
the progression of the artists and
their influences as well. Monet and
Pissarro continued Daubigny’s
exploration into painting out of doors
and would finish their paintings en
plein air instead of back at the studio.
Durand-Ruel’s taste for the more
modern is clear in earlier finds as
well. Gustav’s Courbet Woman in
Waves shows the goddess Venus rising
from the surf, reminiscent of so many
of the earlier mythological works,
but here he includes the model’s
underarm hair, directly subverting
the idea of femininity in his depiction
of beauty personified. Durand-Ruel
is rumoured to have paid a record
price for this work, saying that this
sort of work was far more to his taste
than the academic pieces that he was
accustomed to collecting. Subversion
and the beginning of modern art
are a continuing theme throughout
the sixty plus pieces on show. Degas
provides customary humour in his
paintings, focusing on the balding
heads of the audience as opposed to
the scene being played out on stage in
The Ballet Scene, or on a disinterested
teacher reading the paper rather than
the dancers in The Ballet Class.
The exhibition also seeks to
highlight just how modern the
Impressionists were; while the
painters of previous generations
used naturalistic colours and tiny
brushstrokes blended together, the
pieces of Renoir and Monet show
just how liberated painting became.
Instead of adopting muted shades,
even the white dresses Renoir paints
are alive with technicolour hues,
lemon yellows, and cobalt blues. The
brushstrokes are similarly vivacious –
visceral daubs rather than layers and
layers of gossamer fine renderings
of colour. Even the subject matter is
modern. Setting aside the previous
generations’ fondness for staged
portraiture, mythological or biblical
scenes, we are presented with scenes
of contemporary suburbs, city life;
Monet’s loose brushwork in his
numerous paintings that depict the
Thames echo the veil like fog that
permeated the city at the time.
The Impressionists were the first
to reflect the world they saw around
themselves back at the viewer,
heightened and resplendent in
colour – a celebration of the ordinary.
Monet’s ginormous depiction of
golden brown pastries in The Galettes
is enough to hearten any foodie
Instagrammer – if it’s good enough
for him, it’s probably good enough for
us. It is through these artists that we
were first offered a glimpse into the
modern world. Monet’s Green Park is
furnished with stick like figures oddly
reminiscent of L S Lowry’s scenes of
urban Manchester.
In some of the pieces we also see
the beginnings of abstract painting.
In Alfred Sisley’s The Flood, vertical
lines of a submerged tree and a
telegraph pole are reflected in
the flood waters, which meld into
the same hued sky. For me, the
undisputed star of the exhibition is
the Poplars series by Monet. Monet
painted 24 canvases of poplars in
differing lights and seasons; here
six have been reunited from across
the world for the first time in many
decades. The exhibition is worth the
admission price for these alone. The
trees pierce the canvas dead straight,
tearing through the backdrop of sky
and cloud; foliage swirls around the
trunks like a gymnast’s ribbon. The
brushstrokes echo their movement in
broad sweeps.
Inventing Impressionism is
something of a blockbuster for
the National Gallery. In bringing
together so many big names, it creates
a primer on Impressionism and the
great art of the late 19th
century.
Although staged around Durand-
Ruel, it is the art that unquestionably
takescentre stage. Impressionism
has become such a staple of our art
history that we can be desensitized
to its power; Inventing Impressionism
is the perfect antidote. If you go to
just one exhibition this year, make it
this one.
Inventing Impressionism is on at The
National Gallery, until 31st
May. Tickets
£16 Adults; £8 Students.

Emiel de Lange revels in life’s big questions at the National’s new production
Man and Superman: Comedy and Philosophy
Man and Superman is at once
both funny and serious.
Billed as a “comedy and
a philosophy”, this dual nature has
posed problems in the past and at
first Bernard Shaw staged these parts
separately.
This season, the National Theatre
presents the complete work, and, at
almost four hours long it is quite an
achievement. “The highest form of
art is tragedy”, remarks the Devil as
he bemoans humanity’s obsession
with death. It is interesting then, that
Shaw’s ambitious work is successful
as a comedy – the audience was
frequently in hysterics. The humour
is always witty and intelligent, and
never distracts us from the deeper
reflections; instead it underlines the
absurdities of society, marriage, life.
The play fully grapples with such
big issues as the characters engage in
lengthy debate. Indeed, our hero’s
verbosity is the butt of the final
punchline, but the weight of his
discourse refuses to be forgotten.
These torrents of words, a man’s
sincere attempt to find meaning
in life, become spellbinding and
deeply personal in the hands of
Ralph Fiennes, who plays the part
with complete conviction. At the
height of his philosophising he turns
to the audience, his eyes red with
emotion, and we have no choice but
to empathise with him for, like him,
we realise that we too seek answers
to these questions. This powerful
sequence, set in a hellish dream, gives
way again to the plot whose sunny
scenes at the poolside are now left
with a sense of emptiness.
Perhaps this is the difficulty of
the philosophical comedy, but as
the remaining acts progress they
do create their own significance.
This is thanks in large part to the
performance of Indira Varma as
the heroine Ann – both a symbol of
feminist emancipation and a danger
to the freedom of men. Her character
is endlessly intriguing and enigmatic,
and her marriage to Fiennes’ Tanner
is revealed as the inevitable direction
the plot must take. For Tanner to
reverse his position on marriage so
suddenly (having already heard a
multitude of his revolutionary tirades
on the subject) without a hint of
contrivance we require formidable
acting and direction, and that is what
we get.
Indeed, the entire cast is formidable
and their comedic timing is perfect; I
particularly enjoyed Tim McMullan’s
performance in the role of Mendoza
and the Devil – the antagonist to
Fiennes’ philosophical searching
and the comedic centrepiece (the
bickering between his anarchist
and social democrat friends was
particularly funny). Only the
working-London accent of Straker
and Hector Malone’s American felt
slightly forced and unnatural.
The scenery, designed by
Christopher Oram, with videos by
Luke Halls, is beautifully vague while
still providing necessary context;
dreamy backdrops of moving
clouds or hell-fire surround a more
concrete set of props. These props are
unobtrusive and do not distract from
the drama, but add a comic touch
now and then – such as the elevator
between heaven and hell. If, like me,
you enjoy theatre that is deep and
thought-provoking, then this is a
must-see play.
Man and Superman is on at the
National Theatre until 15th
May. Tickets
from £15.

IC Choir Enthrals with Rapturous ‘O Fortuna’
KAMIL McCLELLAND
ARTS EDITOR
Carmina Burana is a piece almost
every person recognises, if
not in name then for the
monumental ‘O Fortuna’, used
countless times in popular culture.
This could very well have been why
the IC Choir chose to perform it
in their Spring Concert, alongside
Bob Chilcott’s ‘Songs and Cries of
London Town’. However, I often find
that, because audiences approach
performances of well-known pieces
with a great deal of knowledge,
expectations are inevitably higher
and this all too commonly results in
the anticlimactic results.
Fortunately I did not feel it was
the result with this performance, a
difficult piece tackled with tact and
respect. I must however admit at
this point that I am not a great fan
of either piece performed in this
concert and this may have very well
biased my opinion of their rendition;
I find Carmina Burana, written in the
mid-1930s, somewhat falls short of
its attempt to evoke the style and
spirit of the mediaeval poetry it is
based on, and I feel Chilcott’s work is
too cliché, a ‘pleasant’ piece (not used
as a positive term) that has no real
backbone to it.
Having said that, I was looking
forward to what the choir was able to
make of these pieces, whether they
were able to rid me of my pessimism
and convince me that the works
deserve all the attention they receive.
Their cause was not helped by the
choice of venue, the Great Hall, with
its truly dreadful acoustics, and the
fact the house lights were not lowered
during the performance, meaning an
atmosphere was not really created
that was conducive to enjoying the
rich musical textures created by
the choir. How is it possible to truly
transport listeners to an 11th
century
Bavarian monastery when you are
made acutely aware of your less than
holy surroundings?
We started off with Chilcott’s
homage to the bustle of London’s
street markets with help from a
wonderful children’s choir from the
St. Marylebone C.E. School. I honestly
find it very difficult to review student
productions. Do I hold them to
professional standards or to a kind
of ‘student’ standard that takes into
account the fact they are amateurs?
As a student production, it was
excellent, maybe not quite as good as
the phenomenal ICSO last week but
certainly one of the better ones I had
seen. But yes, there were times when
singers did not come in perfectly on
cue, did not have the vocal strength
or were not cohesive enough: a
group of one hundred individual
singers instead of an undulating
auditory body full of intrigue and
emotion. More could have also been
done to build excitement into the
pieces through the use of dramatic
dynamics and the modulation of the
speed of the piece. However, when
you take the piece as a whole, it was
highly enjoyable, with particular
commendation to the dual pianists,
who kept the piece driving forward,
a central force in integrating all its
parts.
Next on to the main spectacle
that burst into life with ‘O Fortuna’,
supported by a fantastic percussion
section and of course the famous
timpani part. Although it could have
been even louder, more epic and
expansive – though this may have
been an issue with the acoustics – I
cannot deny the looks of joy on my
fellow audience members’ faces.
This work also showcased three
superb solo vocalists, baritone
Timothy Connor, tenor Joseph
Doody and finally the soprano Jenny
Stafford: highly talented musicians
who were able to manipulate their
voices like putty to evoke any
emotion required, thoroughly
convincing in their roles. They
brought a more polished performance
to the concert and, when paired with
the piano, were spectacular.
It was refreshing to see the real
passion on the faces of the choir
members and whilst there were
moments that were not as strong,
such as faster sections where I found
the singers too preoccupied with
enunciating the words as opposed
to the quality of the sound they
produced, there were also moments
of sheer brilliance, such as a long
sustained note that persisted with me
for minutes after.
It is difficult to write an overall
review as the quality did occasionally
fluctuate but the rousing finale did
mean that I left the concert with a
definite satisfaction with the evening.
Undeniably there was a lot of skill on
that stage but perhaps just slightly
more rehearsal time would have
elevated the performance to greater
heights.
Be sure to catch their upcoming
performance on 5th
June at St.
Stephen’s Church where they will
perform John Rutter’s Magnificat
and Berstein’s Chichester Psalms.
Hopefully they will be as thrilling
as in this performance, especially
being in a slightly more atmospheric
environment.
