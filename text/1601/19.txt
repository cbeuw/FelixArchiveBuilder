26 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX
13.03.2015
As we approach the end of another
gruelling season, IC 1s are yet again
on the cusp of greatness. After
consolidating their position in the
third tier of BUCS, the team now find
themselves one game away from the
LUSL league title. With a cup Semi
Final still to come, this could prove
to be one of their most successful
seasons in recent history.
IC triumphed 3-2 over their Medic
counterparts earlier in the season,
but critics do not expect this reverse
fixture to be anywhere near as close.
With a philosophy that encourages
free flowing attacking football and a
brand of play that is sure to get fans
off their seats, IC will be expected
to put their opponents to the sword
from the very first minute.
And with the most potent attacking
duo in university football, Robinson
and Murphy, leading the line, the
ruthless streak that has defined IC’s
performances all season will really
come to the fore. Expect goals. Expect
fireworks. Expect an IC win.

Following the double promotion
season of 2012-13, ICSM FC 1st XI
have been in transition. The rebuild
that begun last season, with heroic
relegation battles, has continued this
campaign.
In BUCS we have cemented our
place in the league and done well to
prevent free-fall; the highlight being
a 10-0 aggregate win over Canterbury.
In LUSL things has been tough, as
life should be in the Premier League.
We have pitted our wits against the
first teams from the big London
universities and although we’ve often
come up second, it has been by fine
margins.
An agonising 3-2 defeat to our
Varsity counterparts was somewhat
compensated by a victory against IC
2s. The aforementioned defeat was
a thoroughly enjoyable and evenly
matched game against our great
rivals. Our UH dream is still alive, but
in the meantime, we fully intend to
get some silverware under our belt.
Our defence is built on the heroic
efforts of Tom Page and Hugh Ford
whilst our 3 pronged attack offer
strength and dynamism, not least
thanks to Kem Onubogu – playing
in his final Varsity. A home fixture
is long overdue in Varsity and this
year we welcome Imperial College to
Heston… let battle commence.

The 2s are constantly improving
on great performances, and are
assured of a very successful season
in both BUCS and LUSL leagues.
2nd spot seems secured in BUCS
after promotion last year, and a
team has been built to challenge for
promotion next year. Most of the best
performances have come in LUSL,
however, where wins against the
winners and runner up from last year
have seen a surge towards the top 3,
which is now expected and would be a
stellar achievement for a University
2nd team
Currently trouncing the Medics
1s in the league standings, the front
two joint top goal scorers (13) of
player of first term Isa Ibrahim and
top assister (15) Andrew Sears-Black
now smell blood and look to continue
their prolificacy against the 2s. Unit
and most frequent MOTM Henry
‘Meatball’ Rowett is one to watch –
expect a domineering performance at
the back accompanied by clean sheet
stalwart Jason Tse.
Despite this, stats and accolades
don’t quite describe how well gelled
and team-oriented the 2s are, with
the undeniable and overriding
characteristic of ‘wanting it’. The
2s look forward to embarrassing the
Medics on their home turf.

The 3s go into varsity in
scintillating form, sitting one win
away from gaining an unprecedented
3rd consecutive BUCS promotion
that would make them one of the
most successful IC sports teams in
recent history and put them above the
Medics 1sts in BUCS. This season has
seen some sensational performances
where we have made easy work of
higher ranked and supposedly higher
quality teams.
Scouse goal machine, Ant Wilson,
has been banging them in for fun
and stand out performances from
Fraser Read, Thomas Mies and David
Monk have fuelled the title charge.
Come the 18th of March, the 3s will
be looking to exhibit the vast gap in
quality against the division 5 Medics
3rds team and deliver a professional
and ruthless performance that
hopefully involves a lot of goals for
the travelling IC fans to celebrate.

We have had another good season
this year. Following last season’s
narrow miss for promotion in our
Saturday league, we have pushed
on again this year in attempt for
promotion.
A great start saw us leading the
league for the majority of the season.
However, we suffered a couple of
narrow losses and it seems we are
going to end up just outside of the
promotion places again. Furthermore,
we have improved in the Wednesday
league, finishing comfortably in the
upper half.
We have a very strong squad this
year, with depth in every position,
applying pressure on one another for
places in the starting line-up. We have
shown this year that our defensive
ability has been top class, allowing our
more creative players to have license
to travel forward and cause problems
for the opposition. This will be vital in
our victory at varsity.
Last year we performed well and
lost narrowly, this year we will be
coming back with a very strong squad
to push for victory. There is fantastic
desire in the team and I firmly
believe that the Medics 3rd XI will
be victorious and hold the bragging
rights this year.

This season has been a challenging
one for the 4’s. After a slow start the
teams form ignited in BUCS early
on as we remained unbeaten until
January. This run lead to the team
holding the illustrious Christmas
number 1 spot in the BUCS table,
fuelling dreams of promotion.
Saturdays proved more difficult
however as we found ourselves in
a new LUSL league playing against
some of best teams London has to
offer. After a series of poor results
the squad’s strong team spirit pulled
us through as performances began to
pick up after the festive break.
Though our form has waned in
BUCS, the LUSL survival campaign
is now in full swing. A recent string
of wins has made the impossible look
achievable. The team has managed to
pull itself out of the relegation zone
in LUSL with only one game left to
spare, hitting a rich vain of form just
in time for the Varsity fixture.

It’s been a troubled season for the
Medics 3s that has gained momentum
towards the business end. With many
new faces integrating into the club,
competition for places within the
team has been fierce. Many of the
past 3s players have shown the fresh
talent the ropes and now a fluidity
within the team has started to take
shape, with that comes the confidence
required. It’s set to be a great varsity
afternoon for IMRFC 3s.

from every part of College, including every faculty, department and campus.
Since nominations closed, panels of student Academic Representatives have
been sifting through the 80,000 words of nominations sent in by students - and
they have selected the six best nominees in each category, who are now the
2015 SACAs Shortlistees.
Full details of each Shortlistee can be found on:
