beats
Medics in
top of the
table clash
Wednesday 25th February
saw one of the greatest
basketball games at Imperial.A
confrontation of a rare intensity
between two old rivals.The Mens
2nds and the Medics clashed in a
high-stake game for the top spot
of their BUCS league.Early in the
game,the 2nds showed a few
signs of nervousness,especially
offensively,and conceded several
turnovers.
The Medics perfectly seized
this opportunity to take the lead
after the first quarter.This early
scenario was probably a wake up
call for the 2nds and a reminder
of the bitter loss they suffered to
the Medics in a nail-biting game
(44-47) last year.The 2nds then
took control of the 2nd quarter
and started producing some
smoother offensive moves.
They were able to find the big
man inside and create open looks
for the shooters.At half-time,
the 2nds had turned around the
game to enjoy a comfortable
25-18 lead.The 3rd quarter was
an identical copy of the previous
one.The Medics could not find
any solution to counter the 2nds.
Offensively,they were facing
an aggressive defence,led by
Michael“Skillz”Wells with a
career-high 5 steals.Defensively,
the Medics were overwhelmed
by the 2nds deadeye shooters,
with shooting guard Aurimas
Pabrinkis scoring 22 points (and 4
three-pointers).
The Medics tried to make a
come-back in the 4th quarter,
setting up a full-court pressure
on the 2nds.Yet,they could not
get any benefit and exposed
themselves to many fast breaks.
The game finally ended on a
resounding 58-45 victory for the
2nds.

IC BASKETBALL
Still hurting from their 6-5
defeat to the Medics from the
previous Wednesday, Imperial
were looking to rebound and
continue their otherwise good run of
form at fortress Harlington against
the league leaders King’s. This
already difficult game was made
worse by the fact that playmaker
Pollock was side-lined by an injured
hamstring and Mejnertsen was
still recovering from a knee injury,
leaving only 12 players available
to play. Despite this, the IC team
was looking strong and up for the
challenge with Cerulus finally able
to make a game!
A slightly shaky start by King’s
left them vulnerable to the counter
attack and although the ball was
picked a couple of times from their
defenders, unfortunately the IC
forwards could not capitalise on the
opportunities their solid defensive
play had created. At the other end
of the pitch IC’s back line of Jones,
Alton and Murray did a great job
of shutting down King’s skillful
forwards, while transferring and
distributing the ball well when in
possession. Any entry to our D was
met with the brick wall of Meyer-
Bothling, determined this time to
keep his clean sheet.
The game remained at 0-0 for some
time, with neither side having the
clear upper hand in the game. Just
before half time the King’s defence
threw a long aerial ball into our
23, Alton saw the opportunity for a
great cover drive but sadly caught
an outside edge, allowing the King’s
forward through on goal. There was
nothing Meyer-Bothling could do
this time and a good finish by the
King’s forward put the score to 1-0.
There were no snacks at half time,
but a good team talk from coach
Cooper meant that IC came out
fighting in the second half. King’s
held more possession but both sides
were creating chances, with the
holy trinity of Logtestijn, Vaquero
and Cerulus in the centre playing
simple and effective hockey and
distributing the ball to Hedgecock
and Price on the wings. 2nd team
call up Edwards looked at home,
making some crucial tackles and
linking up well with the midfield.
Good movement from Breakey and
Dittmar led to a handful of penalty
corners, but despite two drag flickers
and several rehearsed routines IC
were unable to find the back of the
net, with the King’s keeper making
some great saves.
There was a similar story at
the other end of the pitch and
skillful play from the King’s attack
rewarded them with several penalty
corners. However, Meyer-Bothling
channelled his inner Nicolas Jacobi
and made some first class saves to
keep the ball out of the goal. IC kept
creating chances until the final
whistle but unfortunately could not
convert and the game ended 1-0 to
Kings.
Thanks to the Ladies 1s for their
continued support.
Man of the Match: Oliver Meyer-
Bothling.
The 3rd XV have had a rather
disappointing year. The
apathy of BUCS in doing
little or nothing to resolve the issue
of South Eastern 7A having only 2
teams left the threes despondent, and
a heavy defeat away in their single
match so far was not the start we
were looking for. Hungry for a win
after the previous match, the 3rd
XV hosted Chichester at Harlington,
otherwise known as ‘The Fortress’. To
put the icing on the cake, the referee
was none other than Big Bad Bob
Coutts, extremely enthusiastic in his
correspondence with the captain.
The day started off with an
embarrassing entrance, being given
our marching orders to ‘Little
Harlington’ changing rooms; the
luxuries of the big rooms were
reserved for the sheer quantity of
numbers in the lacrosse squads. After
struggling for air in changing rooms
being compared to “Harry Potter’s
cupboard under the stairs”, we arrived
on the pitch half an hour before kick
off, and an hour and a half after the
arrival of our opposition.
The first half was a tight affair, with
both teams given scant opportunities.
There were, admittedly, some
squandered chances down to ‘white
line fever’, a syndrome that has
known to affect Will Spenceley Jones
both on and off the pitch. Some key
moments involved Edric getting
kneed in the nose, causing a nosebleed
lasting 50 minutes, and Vincent
‘Weak Bladder’ Desforges retiring
with a fractured elbow. Luckily we
had more than one substitute this
week, and the replacements proved
to be more than capable. It turned
out to be a forwards-dominated
half, unsurprising given the rotund
physiques of the opposition. Imperial
were unfortunate in conceding in the
very last play of the half, down to a
huge overlap and a free kick taken
quickly.
The second half saw a rejuvenated
Imperial side pick up the pressure,
in particular the scrums were highly
effective. Tom Johnstone and the
prodigal son, Merlin Potter-Adams,
giving some push, with Will Jackson
struggling to maintain his temper
in between. After more forwards
play, and some decent kicking,
Imperial had a scrum on the 5m line.
Naturally, the pack dominated, and
Tim ‘Specialist Number 8’ Harrington
controlled the ball from the back to
touch down.
An early highlight was some
outstanding linkup play from the
residents of Batoum; number 8
Harrington taking it from the back of
a scrum, making important yardage
before popping it to number 9 Arm,
who drew his man and released
second row/full back Prichard for a
searing run, stopping short of the try
line to throw an outrageous sonny-
bill to Leonard.
Chichester hit back, with another
try due to flustered heads and a
couple of unfortunate missed tackles,
but the side stayed positive.
10 minutes was spent camped in
the opposition half, before ‘old-hat’
Will Jackson reminded his captain
and scrum-half that box kicks were
a useful tactic. Look Arm took heed,
and gave the slippery Chichester
full-back some challenges. These
gained good territory, and after
some intelligent running by man
of the match, and self proclaimed
BNOC, Ciro Monti, Imperial’s second
try was scored. Leonard slotted the
conversion and we were back on
track. A similar situation gifted Ciro
yet another try, proving his worth in
any position he may attempt to play.
We were 19-14 up, with around 5
minutes to play.
After ‘time where we clench our
buttocks’, with Chichester almost
running through us, we found
ourselves in last play, with our own
lineout. This we took, and won, which
had been the theme all match. We
were left with the decision to take
the win, or go for the last try to add
insult to injury. The maul was strong,
and despite being slapped round the
face, prop-come-back row-come-prop
Locke Macgregor wriggled through
Chichester to score a final try in the
corner and seal a 24-14 victory.

Fencing
claim four
medals at
BUCS
Imperial College Fencing Club
competed at last weekend’s
BUCS individual championships
in Sheffield and in the process
won a total of 4 medals! Men’s
sabre and women’s foil took place
on the first day: Imperial has a
reputation of dominating sabre
and yet again lived up to that
reputation with an all-Imperial
final between men’s 1st team
fencers Maiyuran Ratneswaran
and Chris Lawrence.As both
fencers are in their last year there
was an increased determination
from both sides to bring home
the gold (even though they live
in the same flat) and after a
spectacular display of world-class
sabre,it was Maiyuran who was
victorious winning his 5th BUCS
title 15-12.
It seemed hard to repeat
this feat on the second day but
it started off in a similar way
in the men’s foil with Søren
Pfitzner being seeded 2nd after
the poules in his first BUCS
individuals.He fought well all
day and eventually went out in
the last 16,finishing 9th of 149.
However,women’s épée was also
on the second day and it was in
this event that another medal
was won,this time a bronze from
Francesca Cavallo who fenced
skilfully all day,losing 14-13
in the semi-final in a‘sudden
death’extra minute.Indeed,in
a strong field of 79,women’s
épée saw multiple significant
performances from Imperial
fencers: Caitlin Jones finished
6th,knocked out by Francesca in
a very close fight that finished
15-14,and Maria Constantinescu
finished 12th.
The last day of the competition
was full of expectations for
another medal and Zoe Robinson
did not disappoint,winning
the silver medal in the final;
match of the championships,
having dominated throughout
the day.Imperial’s total of four
medals was the highest number
won by any team at the fencing
championships and placed
Imperial second in the standings,
behind Cambridge who gained
two gold medals.All in all,it
was a more than satisfactory
weekend!

On Wednesday 18th March
the Imperial women’s
Water Polo team travelled
to Loughborough to play their
Championship knock-out match.
A win would mean going through
to the Semi-Finals. We finished
5th in the Premier South division
while Loughborough finished 4th
in the Premier North division,
so we were expecting a very tight
match, especially as we had less
than 24 hours’ notice for this match
to organise transport, get a team
together and mentally prepare.
We arrived in Loughborough
at 11:45 for a 12:30 start with a
small team (as usual) with only
1 substitute, a novelty for us
considering the match before against
Cardiff we had no subs and had to
play the second half man down,
and still managed a draw! We made
a great start by winning the first
quarter 2-0 with both goals coming
from Sophie Linney. Such a strong
start is very unusual for us as we
normally like to make it difficult
for ourselves by having to get back
into the match! This scoring streak
continued into the second quarter
with us extending the lead to 5-0
with another goal from Sophie
Linney and 2 goals from Alexandra
Charleson. The match still wasn’t
won as anything can happen, but
we were sitting very comfortably at
half time and knew that a win was
within in our grasp. With the score
at 7-0 after the third quarter, we were
confident the match was won and
the aim was to now do our goalie,
Lillan Agerup, justice and keep a
clean sheet. The final score was 9-0
with two of the second half goals
coming from Sophie Linney and the
other two from Corrine Bacigal. This
was an absolutely fantastic team
performance from the girls and the
result rewarded everyone’s hard work
and the best team on the day won.
Imperial are now through to the
BUCS Championship round robin
Semi-Finals which will take place
on 14th/15th of March in Sheffield.
We will play three gruelling matches
over this weekend against Sheffield
Hallam, Cardiff and Bristol, which
will require hard work from the
whole team but we have a great
chance of getting through to the
Finals. Considering Imperial only
got promoted to the Premier division
this year, we have done ourselves
very proud already by not only
staying up, but also getting to the
Semi’s.
Early mornings, grey skies, and
downcast drizzle could do
nothing to dampen the spirits
of Imperial College Taekwondo
(ICUTKD), as the 24 strong team
– the largest in the club’s history –
piled into two minibuses to troop
to the British Student Taekwondo
National Championships, in the
ancient cathedral city of Worcester.
After ranking 3rd
nationally in
the previous year, ICUTKD hoped
to build upon their success over the
two days of sparring, patterns, and
spiritedness that makes up the British
Student Taekwondo Championships.
With intense competition from
a pool of 387 competitors across
42 clubs, ranging from Exeter to
Glasgow (to say nothing of the
50 strong team from Imperial’s
perennial rivals, UCL), outperforming
the diverse and talented competition
seemed an almost impossible goal.
Yet, ICUTKD managed to rise to the
challenge in a spectacular fashion,
nabbing 30 Medals (10 gold, 5 silver,
15 bronze) from its 24 strong pool,
in addition to placing first in Female
Team sparring; enough to place third
nationally for overall WTF sparring
performance, and fourth nationally
across both sparring and patterns.
With the biggest student
Taekwondo competition behind
them, ICUTKD are far from
complacent. Setting their sights on
the next academic year, they hope
to host their own competition (for
the fourth consecutive year) and
inter-university training sessions,
in addition to building upon their
successes in Worcester.
ICUTKD train on Mondays and
Saturdays in the Union Gym and
Thursdays in Activity Space 2.

Sunday 8th March saw the game
we had been waiting for all
season, the London Bowl 2015.
The Imperial Immortals and the
King’s College London Regents have
a fierce rivalry after first playing
six years ago where Kings won and
created the London Bowl trophy.
However, for the past few years it has
stayed in South Kensington with the
Immortals as King’s have struggled to
keep up.
The Immortals started the
game kicking off and the Regents
started with a strong drive that
the Immortals’ defense was more
than equal to, keeping them out
of the endzone and forcing them
to punt. The Immortals offense
went out and played like they had
a point to prove running the ball
hard through Le’Bami Falana who
picked up a filthy four touchdowns
on the day. He ran harder and
faster than ever and really deserved
such a performance after such a
strong season. Together Le’Bami,
D’Emanuel and Rayane Hobollah
have been the battering rams that
have pushed hard every step to
drive the team forward with their
running this season. Toby Sinclair
played well and cleverly on the
day, as he has all season, avoiding
sacks and keeping drives alive. He
also picked up a touchdown on
the day with a QB sneak – classic
Sinclair. The Immortals defense
had a great day on the field too,
only letting in one touchdown, with
Guillaume ‘G’ Fontan making tackles
all over the field and Panukorn
Taleongpongdong playing hard
killing people in the middle of the
field. Jörn ‘Gorab’ Jörg gets a special
mention for causing two fumbles
with his impressive and extensively
practiced stripping routine.
Will ‘Angry but Prez’ Nicholson
recovered two fumbles and swatted
one down with his ridiculous club,
way to step up pal. Special case
of the day award, and Immortals
Stone, goes to Alex Hitchinson
for managing to kick a field goal
attempt into one of his own players
heads – maybe next time Hitch. A
moment of silence was needed for
Little Harry Collini’s elbow after it
took a hefty hit from a helmet and
basically became jelly.
However, all in all a great day was
had by everyone and it was nice for
the Immortals to get some well-
deserved success. We wish to thank
all of our supporters that came to
watch us beat King’s 32-6.
