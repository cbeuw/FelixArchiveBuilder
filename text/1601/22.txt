hockey is actually played. The start of
the season may have been a little slow
but within a couple of games we were
in full swing and scoring the goals
(on and off the pitch) when it really
mattered.
Our superiority over the medics in
all aspects of the sport will become
evident within mere minutes and the
unevenly matched teams will make
for an entertaining game for all the
IC supporters. The defensive line will
show absolutely no mercy in their
quest to keep the medics without any
goals and our forwards will continue
to repeatedly penetrate the D. As we
do every Wednesday at sports night.
The fresher’s are especially good at
it having learned from some of the
older more experienced players.

This season we have really settled
into our recently promoted, tough
BUCS league, no longer being
the newbies but presenting real
competition for the other teams.
We have learnt how to deal with
pressure and have had some fantastic
results against the tougher teams in
our league. Unfortunately, we have
been extremely injury-prone this
season with many matches ending up
a player or two down.
However, we have not let that
affect our drive to win each match
and our team morale is as high as
ever! We continue to train with an
international coach who, as well as
focusing on the basics, has taught us
a new trick or two to help at those
crucial moments during Varsity.
With both teams doing well in
their respective leagues this match
promises to be one to watch!

The team have had a cracking
season this year, with 4 newbies
joining the team! We’ve had some
great success in BUCS, a highlight
being our 27-0 win! Unluckily we
narrowly missed out on promotion,
coming joint top of the league
and losing out on goal difference.
However, this has just made us more
determined to prove ourselves at
Varsity and put our new shooting
skills into practice!

It’s been a tough season for the
1s, after being promoted last year.
We’ve had injuries to crucial players
throughout the year which has led to
inconsistent performances.
A mid table LUSL position and a
lower BUCS standing don’t do our
quality justice and when we’ve turned
up we’ve shown we can turn it on – as
IC know well. We’ve done the double
over them in BUCS with 4-1 & 6-5
victories which means they’re yet to
show they can beat us. With 26 goals
shared between the teams over 3
fixtures this season (including a 5-5
draw in LUSL), Varsity promises to be
a thriller – bring it on!

The Imperial Medics Hockey 2nd
XI have had an impressive season
so far. In BUCS we narrowly missed
out on a chance for promotion
but remain in good stead to finish
comfortably in second place.
We’ve only come up against IC
once this year, and after a very
closely fought game, they came out
as dubious 1-0 winners. Having gone
from strength to strength since then,
we are confident that this time the
final result will be different. With a
mix of players from all years at the
med school, from freshers to final
years, we have got a tightly knit squad
who are willing to fight and work
hard for each other and are raring
to go in what will undoubtedly be an
exciting and sharply contested match.

The 2014/2015 season has been
a great one for the IC Men’s 3s. We
started off slowly with an opening
loss to LSE but since then we have
gone from strength to strength and
we currently sit in pole position in
both our BUCS and LUSL leagues
with an aggregate goal difference
of +34 which is a big contrast to
the -47 goal difference our medic
counterparts have managed to
achieve.
Our results give us an optimistic
attitude for Varsity and historically
we have come out on top; last year
finished 2 – 1 to IC due to great
finishing by Jamie Couchman.
However, the Medic 3s always bring
their best to Varsity and they are
technically in the BUCS league above
us (no doubt due to their large Squad
that seems to extend to their Men’s
1s) so we will need to be ruthless in
our play and I have no doubt that if
we play as we have this past season
and they play like they have, we will
come out on top.

With an array of club injuries and
uncontrollable external factors, this
years 3rd XI has been completely
turned up side down. With a difficult
season in a tough BUCS league, the
results have not gone our way.
However we have developed
immensely as a squad and hence
had some brilliant performances
in our LUSL league and in the
inaugural United Hospitals Reserves
Tournament.
With newfound confidence, the
team are sure we can put last year’s
narrow loss behind us, and return to
take the win we deserve.

The men’s squash team has had
a fantastic season, winning LUSL
unbeaten and losing only one
match in BUCS to win the league
comfortably. We also had a good
cup run, reaching the last 16 in both
LUSL and BUCS cups and then losing
to strong 1st Teams from King’s
and Kent respectively. New boys
Tom Readshaw and David Anderle
have been exceptionally consistent
all season and strong inputs from
Sanjay Bhattacharya, Kharthik
Chakravarthy, Raf Pesquidous and
Moaz Hamid have ensured that we
have been the team to beat in our
leagues.

It’s been a fantastic year for the
Medics Squash teams. A wave of
new talent has swept into the club
freshening and strengthening the
Women’s team, and the Men’s 1st and
2nd teams. Captain Dom Marshall
has lead the Men’s first team to a 4th
place finish, winning five of eight
games in LUSL division one.
This is an encouraging
improvement from last season’s one
win. In a similar fashion, Captain
Tom Li has lead the second team to
three wins from eight games, a three
win improvement on last year’s
campaign, with one match still to
play. Men’s squash has never been
stronger and we move onwards with a
fresh optimism.
The Women’s team has also made
impressive strides since last year.
Under the leadership of Captain
Anna Humphreys, the women’s team
achieved a record number of wins,
giving them a solid mid-table finish.

We’ve had an amazing season so
far with massive development in our
game and loads of wins, including
a 3 match-winning streak! It’s been
great fun playing with the team and
watching so much improvement,
particularly with players new to
the game. Seeing our team grow
stronger and become closer has been a
fantastic experience. I look forward to
leading the team into what should be
the closest female basketball varsity
for years!

This season has been a successful
one for the mens’ 1st team as we are
currently projected to finish 2nd
in the league. We lost half the 1st
team at the end of last year so it was
great to see such a high standard of
badminton during trials.
Currently the team consists of 3
medics and 3 non-medics (including
a PHD student), making it quite a
diverse team. On the badminton
court we were knocked out of the cup
by the men from the LSE 2nd team in
the first round, however it was a close
match and the result was only decided
on total point score.
In the league we’ve had our fair
share of wins, but with one too many
draws it seems unlikely we’ll be
getting promoted back to the league
from which we got relegated from last
year. The most memorable part of the
year has to be the games played on the
trains to those far away games.
David Zhang thinks Caspar is a
female ghost and (still) owes the whole
first team a pint. I have thoroughly
enjoyed captaining this team and I
wish my successor all the best.

This season, IC lacrosse is ready to
repeat last year’s feat of thrashing
the medics. With this year being
one of the best years for Women’s,
Men’s and Mixed lacrosse, there’s no
doubt about it: IC players make all the
difference. Diet plans and training
schedules in preparation for Varsity
have begun.
How will the medics be able to
handle Sophie “The Bolt” Bolton,
Ahranee “Goal Denied” Canden,
Lukas “Legs It” Krauss? How will
they play with Anisha “Yellow Card”
Kanabar, Jeorgie “Lax Love” Halson,
Georgie “Short fuse” Bella-Tabernero
and Mikey “Over One Year Dry”
Forrest on the pitch? It shall be
victory like never before.

This year at varsity, the medics
are coming back with an absolute
vengeance, ready to put IC back in
their rightful place. We have a strong,
solid team with a brilliant addition,
Mr Charles Merry – an absolute
demon on the field (and off it).
We welcome back our rapid
midfielders William Stanger and
Edward Donnely, who weren’t able to
attend last year as they were saving
lives down in Africa (medic life)
Olivia Morley, top goal scorer, will
without fail be demonstrating some
beautiful, graceful (and deadly) shots
on goal. And will this be the one year
Thomas Emms doesn’t shoot a goal? I
feel confident in saying probably not.
Lacrosse varsity is always very
good fun. Despite our very close
friends being on the opposing team,
it’s always an extremely heated and
close match. This year is ours for
the taking. Medics are in it to win it.
Come support and watch us kick some
IC butt.
