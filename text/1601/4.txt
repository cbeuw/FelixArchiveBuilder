Students across Imperial have
come together to mourn the
loss of first year student Georg
Zänker, 20, who passed away on
Saturday.
Georg fell from his second
floor bedroom window in Willis
Jackson Hall last Tuesday morning.
Ambulances arrived at the hall just
after 8:40am, and Georg was taken to
St. Mary’s hospital.
He did not regain consciousness,
and students were informed of his
death the following Monday. His
roommate has been moved to another
room elsewhere in the hall for the
time being.
Georg, who was from Berlin,
Germany, was a Computing
student, and was running to be the
Department of Computing Society
(DoCSoc) Webmaster.
An email informing Computing
students of his death was sent
on Monday. Professor Susan
Eisenbach, Head of the Department
of Computing, said: “Georg was
an excellent student who played
a proactive part in our student
community.
“In addition to his outstanding
grades, he enjoyed participating in
Hackathons, and was running for
Webmaster of DoCSoc. As a well-
liked and enthusiastic member of our
community he will be sorely missed.
Our thoughts and deepest sympathies
are with Georg’s family and friends”.
Georg’s campaign website included
his manifesto, which displayed his
enthusiasm for the role and for
Imperial in general. “One of the
coolest things of coming to Imperial
is the sheer number of events that
are run by DoCSoc … consequently, I
decided that I wanted to contribute
to this superduperawesome society as
being Webmaster”.
He was also an active member
of Cross Country Society, and the
German society.
Memorials were held for Georg,
first on Monday in his hall for
students, and on Wednesday in the
computing department, where a
non-denominational service and
tributes from both staff and students
were given. Those gathered were also
able to sign a Book of Remembrance,
which Professor Eisenbach plans to
take to Georg’s funeral back in Berlin.
Nicolas Prettejohn, the current
DoCSoc webmaster, second year
representative for Computing and
friend of Georg, read out an eulogy at
the memorial on Wednesday.
Nicolas spoke to those present
about Georg’s passion for his subject,
how he enjoyed getting involved
with departmental activities and
how he was “always cheerful, smiling
broadly and enthusiastic to make new
friends. He took every opportunity to
touch the lives of students across the
department.
“Georg took great pleasure in being
involved and I see that as a testimony
to his character: He wasn’t content
with sitting on the sidelines. That
wasn’t Georg”.
Nicolas also spoke about how Georg
was hardworking; he was a regular
resident in the computing labs over
the weekend, and had an insatiable
appetite for his subject. Nicolas
continued: “Not only did he work
incredibly hard, there was always an
awesome project or an exciting article
to tell me about”.
Georg loved the companionship of
his classmates too. “The way he saw it,
we were all in this together”.
Nicolas concluded by saying how
much Georg will be missed. “Georg’s
passing leaves a hole in the lives of
his family, his friends, his classmates,
and the department.
“Given time we will begin to heal.
Coursework will still be submitted
and exams will still be sat. Studying
here was Georg’s dream.
“And as long as we remember Georg
he will live his dream through us”.
College in mourning after first year
student passes away
Georg was my roommate,but
more than that,he was my friend.
He was a brother to me and I loved
him; he had an infectious passion
for his subject,for his friends,and
for everything in-between.
I know so many people who grow
to resent their roommates within a
couple of weeks,but within a couple
of days I knew that Georg and I were
compatible,and that only grew
from there.
We had a healthy sense of passive
aggression towards each other
when either one of us irritated
the other one,and he never failed
to make me laugh; albeit not
always intentionally.He had a
very dry sense of humour,often
saying things about efficiency and
complaining about English systems
–he was also always smiling and
many people that didn't even know
him personally knew his face and
his enthusiasm towards everything.
He was renowned on our floor
of halls for making strange food,
especially his daily sandwiches:
these consisted of peanut butter,
bacon,salad,and tomato sauce.
He made these consistently on the
same day at the same time,so if
you could smell bacon late in the
evening,you knew it was round
about 11pm.Whenever he was
questioned about these sandwiches
he was adamant that it was normal
in Germany,justifying how they
were the most calorie efficient.
After talking to his family recently
I have a) found out that this is not
normal in Germany and b) that
Georg always made weird food.
He was one of the most
authentic people I have ever
met,always giving his honest
opinion,regardless of anyone
else's problems with what he said.
He enjoyed his subject more than
anyone I have met and he would
often talk to me enthusiastically
about something that I had no clue
about,but he would discuss it with
me regardless.
The last words I ever said to him
were"Good morning",and the
honest truth is that ever since I've
woken up without him in the room,
the phrase hasn't been true when I
say it.My heart is broken and I will
never stop missing him.

failed to make

different ways.It can take a long
time to come to terms with death,
and to seek help is a very positive
and important step.

Union Council met this
Tuesday and voted to reverse
its previous decision not
to campaign against the closure of
Weeks Hall.
The Union Council also voted in
favour of #ICaProblem, a new student
led campaign hoping to tackle the
“lack of consultation, communication
and transparency” in College decision
making.
Council agreed to ask College to
delay the closure of Weeks Hall
until a future purpose was agreed
upon, and until a “full, transparent
consultation” over the use of the hall
has taken place.
The Union Council meeting was
attended by many residents of Weeks
Hall, present and former, who turned
up to support the paper asking for
Council to reconsider their previous
stance.
The discussion covered the
present state of the hall, its need for
refurbishment and also the benefits
of campaigning against a decision
that College has apparently already
made.
It was announced earlier this week
that the Provost Board, a College
decision-making body consisting
of senior members of College staff,
decided to close Weeks for the next
academic year.
Statements released by College
stated that Provost Board has
agreed to close the hall, as it requires
“refurbishment work that is essential
for its continued use as student
accommodation”.
They also stated that the College
doesn’t have definitive plans
for Weeks Hall yet, although it
cannot continue in its function
as accommodation as it would be
“difficult to refurbish [Weeks] … to
bring it in line with the standards of
other accommodation”.
However, students living in Weeks
Hall had only praise for the condition
of the hall and one resident stated
that he would happily pay more to
live in the Hall in its current state,
due to its proximity to campus.
Parallels between the closure of
Weeks and the closure of Garden
Halls were also drawn, with one
student explaining that it was only
recently that they began to remove
student furniture from Garden Hall,
which has sat vacant for nearly two
years since its closure in 2013.
Some students voiced concern over
the College closing a hall but still
Union Council reverses decision on
campaign against closure of Weeks Hall
Philippa Skett reports as council is flooded with Weeks residents
having no clear plans as to what the
space will be repurposed for, with
Weeks residents unimpressed with
the responses from College thus far.
The Union Council revote follows
those made in the previous Council
meeting, when students were first
asked to vote to either campaign
against the closure or accept the
College’s decision to shut Weeks Hall.
The vote was originally repeated
after initial consensus showed an
equal split in opinion over the matter.
The final outcome was that Union
Council members decided not to
oppose the closure and supported the
potential transformation of the hall
into childcare facilities for academics
and other College staff.
Those that attended Council
however were impressed with the new
agreement to campaign against the
closure.
Said one resident who was present
at the meeting: “It was inspiring to
see such a large collection of students
passionately supporting something
that in reality would make no
difference to them, seeing as they
would all either be moving out at the
end of the year or had already moved
out in years past.
“The result of this meeting was
definitely more a point of principle
than practicality, but this in itself is
still an admirable victory”. Towards
the end of the meeting before the
voting was cast, a student asked
whether reversing the Union Council
decision would mean the College
would now agree to keep Weeks open.
Union President Tom Wheeler
responded, “I would like to say yes…”.
However, during a meeting between
Felix and Professor Debra Humphris,
Vice Provost (Education), when we
asked if College would keep Weeks
open if Union Council wanted them
to, she did not give an answer.
Statements on the College website
did confirm that the Provost board
has agreed to let Pembridge Hall
remain open, a decision made in line
with the wishes of Union Council.
They stated that Pembridge Hall
would remain open for “the next
three years at least”.
The Provost Board has also
commissioned a “feasibility study”
to establish a future use for the north
side of Princes Gardens, including
Weeks hall.
However, College is yet to address
how the closure of Weeks will
affect the average rent price that
was already agreed upon by Union
Council.
At the last Union Council meeting,
rent matrices were presented to the
Council by College outlining average
rent prices per hall, including the
relatively cheaper Weeks Hall and the
new student accommodation based
in Acton.
Many students were under the
impression that because Weeks
featured in these price matrices,
it would remain open for the next
academic year. When Felix had
previously enquired as to when
Weeks was closing, College could not
give an answer.
Although the matrices had
different prices for different halls, the
average cost of a bedroom per person,
per week, remained at £166 for each
variation of rent prices Council was
asked to choose between.
Union Council agreed to a rent
matrix that allowed the price of
Woodward to drop to £120, but
meant halls nearer to campus would
see their rent rise as a result.

If Weeks is to close next year, the
matrices Union Council voted on are
therefore false, as they had included
the prices of rooms in Weeks.
Humphris said earlier this week,
before the Union Council meeting
took place: “We’re determined to
provide the very best residential
experience to our students but we
also have difficult decisions to make
about the best use of our facilities and
resources, both now and in the future.
“We haven’t always got it right
in the past but we are absolutely
committed to partnering with
students where we can to make these
decisions”.
She said that when it comes to
consultation with the students it is
not always possible, but was adamant
that College still works closely with
students, citing the opportunity
students had to vote on the new rents
matrices (despite these now being
incorrect).
Said Humphris: “That [was] a great
step forward in partnership working
between the College and Union, and
it’s thanks to the real leadership
shown by ICU President Tom
Wheeler”.
