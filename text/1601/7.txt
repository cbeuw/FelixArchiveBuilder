Methods developed at Imperial could make

Lauren Ratcliffe on converting waste carbon dioxide into useful materials
Fossil discovery sheds light on human origins

SCIENCE WRITER
If we are to avoid further
aggravating climate change we
need to find a way to store or
transform the hundreds of billions
of tonnes of carbon dioxide produced
by power stations worldwide
into something useful. A team at
Imperial’s Department of Chemistry
have done just this. Working with
the spin-off company, Econic
Technologies, they have developed
a cleaner way to produce valuable
materials from waste carbon dioxide
and are bringing it to the market.
Since the 1960s there has been
much research into ways of
converting carbon dioxide into a
suitable chemical intermediate.
Freely available, with low toxicity
as well as being an environmental
nightmare, this molecule lends itself
to this type of research. However,
developing catalysts and processes
to convert carbon dioxide has been
problematic. Mainly because this
highly oxidised state of carbon is at
the lowest energy state of all carbon
containing C1 species, meaning that
a huge amount of energy is needed to
reduce it.
However, there has been progress,
with the development of catalysts
to successfully incorporate carbon
dioxide into polymers. These
polymers can later by used in
polyols, which are used to make
polyurethanes, a material found
in tonnes of consumer and
industrial products, including
Spandex! However, at the moment,
industrial processes for producing
these valuable polyols requires
petrochemicals such as the toxic,
expensive and energy inefficient
propylene oxide.
Previous cleaner methods that have
been developed to produce polyols
using carbon dioxide have been
found to work only with high purity
carbon dioxide. Despite being a step
in the right direction, this process is
not practical as one of the principle
applications of this technology is to
clean up real sources of waste carbon
dioxide.
Experiments by Imperial’s team
of researchers were conducted using
carbon dioxide from Ferrybridge
Power Station carbon capture
demonstrator plant in West
Yorkshire. The results published in
ACS Catalysis this February indicate
that by using the novel catalyst
technology developed at Imperial,
it was possible to use waste carbon
dioxide to produce useful products
such as polyurethanes at much
lower pressures and temperatures
than previous methods. These
polyurethanes can then be used to
valuable materials from furniture to
the soles of your trainers.
This method makes the process
more economically appealing to
existing polyurethane manufacturers,
offering a cheaper and more
environmentally friendly alternative
to exclusive petrochemical usage.
The team has estimated that for
every tonne of carbon dioxide used,
two tonnes of emissions could be
saved through circumventing the
production of the petrochemical-
based raw material it displaces.
Many industries that emit large
quantities of carbon dioxide are also
likely to be obliged to use carbon
capture and sequestration (CCS) in
the future with the introduction of
environmental policies to reduce
levels of atmospheric greenhouse
gas. CCS is a costly process, but using
carbon dioxide as a raw material
to make polymer materials could
offset these costs. “Using real
carbon dioxide emissions to make
useful products is very challenging,
because frequently catalysts are not
tolerant of minor contaminants,”
said Professor Charlotte Williams,
lead author of the study. “Carbon
dioxide streams from power stations
Humans still have an
unmistakable tie to our
ape origins. The question
is, how did we get from such a
beginning to our where we are
now? The fossil record provides a
fragmented view of human evolution.
From this record, the time of split
between the Homo genus and
Australopithecus genus remains
ambiguous. Fossilised remains
of Homo habilis mark the split
between Homo and Australopithecus
dating between 2.4 and 1.5 million
years ago (mya). However, with the
continual advancement within
palaeoanthropology we have recently
seen the discovery of a lower jawbone
and five teeth belonging to the Homo
linegage which dates to around 2.8
mya. Disputes concerning whether
the fossilised remains of Homo
habilis specimens belong to the
Australopithecus genus and thus
splits in the latter lineage occurring at
a later date, are challenged.
The significance of the
Australopithecus-Homo divergence
is owed to the transition of ape-
like species to forms resembling
modern humans. Characteristics
such as expansion of brains; body
enlargement; decrease in the extent
of sexual dimorphism in terms of
body size; tool usage; changes in
are among the most contaminated
sources of CO2
available, so the work
we have done is a big step forward
because the catalysts show such
remarkable tolerance and function in
almost exactly the same way as using
pure CO2
.”
Econic Technologies was initially
set up to commercialise the catalysts
developed by the team at Imperial.
The research has already attracted
the attention of major chemical
companies to support the adoption
of this more economically sound
and environmentally friendly
technology. The research was funded
by the Government’s Department of
Energy and Climate Change and the
Engineering and Physical Sciences
Research Council and published on
the February 10, 2015.

limb proportions; reduction of cheek
teeth size and unique Homo features
of the brain were derived. This
novel discovery in the Afar region
of Ethiopia, the Ledi-Geraru areas
250 miles from Addis Ababa, is of
high importance. The fossil remains
provide clarification to a “ poorly
documented hominin evolution,”
says Erin N. DiMaggio, associate
in the department of geosciences
Penn State – especially within this
important time frame between 3 and
2.5 mya.
A more definite age of the
remains cannot be given due to
the absence of a direct method to
ascertain a date. Measuring different
isotopes of argon can determine
the age of eruption producing the
volcanic ash or tuff preserving the
sample. Thus, can imply the age of the
sample. The age of the rocks above
and below the sample are found to
indicate the earliest and oldest dates
for the fossil. In addition, other
fossilised organisms in the area at
the implied date are determined to
reveal the environment in which
the hominin fossil once existed.
Prehistoric antelope, hippopotamus,
water dependent grazers, elephants,
and fish suggest that habitat was a
mixture of grasslands and shrublands
some 2.8 mya. There has thus been
a definitive change in the climate
in this region which could have
triggered the Australopithecus-Homo
split.
Although it is still too soon
to say whether the climatic signal
and change in climate triggered
the divergence between the Homo
and the Australopithecs lineage;
the signal never-the-less acts as
evidence supporting the proposed
climate hypothesis. One of the
many theories to explain explain the
Australopithecus-Homo split. These
novel fossilised remains provide a
significant stepping-stone in our
knowledge of human evolution.
