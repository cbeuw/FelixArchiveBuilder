Aiden Langan wangles a ticket to Yeezy’s secret sold-out show
Kanye comes to Camden
Kanye West has been preparing
for the launch of his new
album, So Help Me God, in
the UK for quite some time. He
performed new song, ‘All Day’, at
the Brits with a large variety of UK
grime artists (or rather they were
merely his hype-men). He’d been on
the Jonathan Ross show on Friday
to perform another new song, ‘Only
One’. He visited Oxford the following
Tuesday for a 20 minute talk on fine
art, the Nobel Peace Prize and the
class system.
The most exciting thing happened
on the morning of Wednesday 4th
March though; Kanye West was to
perform a small club show at KOKO
in Camden. Having announced the
show at 18:47 the day before, tickets
sold out in 20 minutes and were being
sold on outside the venue in excess of
£100 with ease (tickets were originally
£49.50). Nothing about the show was
known except that Kanye West would
be playing and doors would open at
11pm.
I had more to be excited about as
not only was this my first time seeing
Kanye, but my first hip-hop show.
At 11pm, wristbands were obtained
but doors were not being opened yet.
People were getting cold and restless
as time went on and it was 00:15
when doors finally opened. Entering
KOKO, the dancefloor and stage
were in darkness and there was no
music playing. All that could be seen
for the stage production was a blank
screen. People sang football chants to
keep themselves entertained but the
excitement was palpable.
At 01:00, the opening beats to
‘All Day’ came in and the crowd
went mental. People were crowd
surfing within seconds and then the
music cut out. Skepta came on and
performed his hit ‘That’s Not Me’ and
I realised that this wasn’t just a Kanye
West show, but rather the ultimate
hip-hop concert with, importantly,
UK grime artists represented. At any
other show, this may not have worked
but the idea that Kanye West was
in the back like an excited teenager
going to his first concert and getting
the opportunity to be on stage showed
that he cared about this music and
wasn’t just jumping on a bandwagon.
The backdrop to the stage was
remarkably simple; there was no Jesus
actor, no mountains, no mask, no
Kim (thankfully). Heck, there weren’t
even any of his famous rants. The
blank screen now had a slideshow
of medieval woodcuts featuring the
crucifix and other associated images,
as well as the rumoured artwork for
So Help Me God.
More grime hits such as ‘German
Whip’ and ‘96 Fuckries’ were played
by members of Boy Better Know
with Kanye dancing away in the
background. The crowd sung every
word as if it was a Kanye hit. But
when a Kanye hit did happen, such
as ‘Cold’ which featured a snippet of
Foreigner’s ‘Cold as Ice’, the crowd
sung at West’s command without him
having to say a word. Whilst he didn’t
need to try at all, this was Kanye at his
most pleasing, working his hardest
and going all out to prove a point.
The most appropriate song for this
show was ‘Clique’ with the crowd
enjoying it as much as the performers
were on stage. As everyone shouted
‘Clique’ back at Kanye, I realised
that Yeezy season had truly arrived.
Skepta returned to perform his
newest song ‘Shutdown’ in which he,
well, shut it down. At the halfway
point, new songs from So Help Me
God were played. We had ‘Wolves’,
which was debuted on American
staple Saturday Night Live. The
remarkably simple song, whilst quite
profound, was a distinct change from
the general sound of Yeezus. The
new, never before played, track ‘U
Mad’ was performed. Similar in style
to both ‘Mercy’ and a grime track,
the fact that it was a new song didn’t
stop the crowd singing it back after a
minute of it being played. It had the
anger of Yeezus but sounded nothing
like anything from that album.
It was at this point that the big
hitters came out. ‘We had Power’,
‘Can’t Tell Me Nothing’, ‘All of the
Lights’ and ‘Good Life’ all in a row,
with the little matter of a Big Sean
appearance in the middle. Not all of
his hits were played; there was a lack
of ‘Stronger’ and ‘Gold Digger’ but he
didn’t need them considering ‘Jesus
Walks’ from his debut album The
College Dropout was dropped.
At this point, the song began and
Kanye was not happy. The wrong
backdrop was displayed and he
demanded the right backdrop was
shown by shouting ‘Next!’ repeatedly
at which point the computer used
had gone to the home screen and
the backdrop went completely dark.
There was a nervous laugh from the
crowd when Kanye said ‘Next’ again.
Eventually the right backdrop was
displayed: a crucifix. Kanye then
formed a crucifix pose in front of it
while the crowd was unintentionally
hyped by Kanye’s tech guy fucking
up. This was perhaps the highlight
of the show up until this point as
the anger of Yeezus was on complete
display. But there were still some
more surprises and more demands to
come.
‘Black Skinhead’ was played and the
bass of the song quite literally pushed
me back, which brings me to the
sound. It was loud, very loud. Almost
too loud for a Wednesday at 2am but
man, I’m glad it was. I’ve never been
literally moved by a song but Kanye
had done it. And then he stopped it,
demanded strobes and it began again.
I was pushed back and the power of it
hit me again.
Then there was the biggest surprise
of the night. Raekwon from Wu
Tang Clan, perhaps one of the most
influential old school hip-hop groups,
came out and performed ‘C.R.E.A.M.’
from Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers),
an album everyone should own. And
how did Kanye top that? He got every
guest out and performed ‘All Day’, a
song which was received as if it was
an instant classic in his canon. He left
the stage as did his entourage, then
returned a while later and played it
again. Kanye had shut down London
on a Wednesday morning before
leaving for Paris the next day, having
shown the UK how a hip-hop show
should be done, at the simplest level.
Now where’s his goddamn croissants?!
