John Park pays tribute to the
women of network television
Welcome back ladies: it’s
your time to shine
Whatever may be happening
in the film industry with
regards to tackling the
issue of creating meatier roles for
women, there certainly does not
seem to be a shortage of complex,
well-rounded roles for actresses In
television. Strong, independent,
dominant women come in all forms,
appear in all sorts of genres, and are
a welcome addition to the world of
small-screen entertainment, as they
all battle for success in their fields.
They have all been with us for several
years now (with the exception of one
freshman series in discussion here),
and how they have developed over
the course of the shows has been a
fascinating journey. Welcome back
ladies, and long may you rule the
world of primetime television.
Carrying the beacon of light for
the sixth year now is lawyer Alicia
Florrick of The Good Wife, played by
the tough-as-nails, Emmy-winning,
Julianna Margulies. No longer
deterred nor defined by her husband’s
shocking political sex scandal that
turned her life upside down in the
pilot episode, Alicia has gone from
a junior associate of a law firm close
to getting fired, to become a named
partner at her very own successful
firm. Her ambition does not stop
there: she has also recently found
the calling to run for the State’s
Attorney’s office, a political race
that throws new challenges her way
– all of them morally ambiguous
and ethically dubious. Yet she
remains steadfast in her belief and
determination that she will actually
do a good job, and as someone who
has stuck by her for all these years, it
is not difficult to absolutely believe
everything she says. She is at the most
complicated, busiest time of her life,
having to handhold top clients of
her firm, trying to focus on winning
the race with countless interviews,
trick questions and mind games from
the opponents, whilst also having to
deal with her personal life. Season
5 saw the shocking exit of a beloved
character who was destined to become
the lasting love interest for Alicia,
but now with Will Gardner (Josh
Charles) gone, Alicia not only has
grief, but now feels more comfortable
to explore possible options. Two
good-looking candidates come to
mind, her campaign manager Johnny
Elfman (Steven Pasquale), and fellow
lawyer Finn Polmar (Matthew
Goode). Yes, she is still married to her
influential husband, Peter, who is
now the Governor of Illinois. But she
is smart enough to know that this is a
marriage of convenience, one that is
used to further each other’s political
aspirations. And why the hell should
she not use this to her advantage? Her
husband has made and continues to
make one too many mistakes and she
has had it. All we can say is, to quote
Chelsea Handler in This Means War,
“get out there, you get flexible!”. Her
character is veering further away
from the old-fashioned, traditional
sense of what the terminology “the
good wife” may evoke, and it is about
damn time that she takes full control
of her own life.
Despite the many fluctuations
in the overall quality of the show,
medical drama Grey’s Anatomy is still
going strong in its eleventh season,
posting more than decent ratings in
the important 18-49 demographic.
There was a worry that with the
departure of the irreplaceable
Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), the
show would never be the same. The
series has since tried to introduce
someone else of dependant comfort
and reliance to Meredith Grey (Ellen
Pompeo) in the form of her half-sister
Dr Maggie Pierce (Kelly McCreary),
and to be frank, this has not quite
worked out in terms of finding a
suitable replacement. But the most
interesting sub-plot of late has not
included Meredith, not one bit.
Focusing on Meredith only brings up
tedious marital troubles between her
and her husband, neurosurgeon Dr
Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey),
given how the writers of Grey’s
Anatomy cannot leave any one happy
couple alone. But Patrick Dempsey
has been given a few episodes off
and the latest episodes have been all
about Derek’s younger sister, Amelia
Shepherd (Caterina Scorsone) who
is also a neurosurgeon, struggling
to live up to the high expectations
already set by her world-renowned
older brother. Amelia is smart, and
thinks at a speed at which most
people struggle to keep up. Her
biggest challenge is taking on a brain
tumour of a fellow doctor in the
hospital, neonatal surgeon Dr Nicole
Herman (Geena Davis). Dr Herman,
learning of her terminal diagnosis,
takes Dr Arizona Robbins (Jessica
Capshaw) under her wings and starts
to impart all the latest, cutting-edge
research, skills, and knowledge;
passing on the torch so to speak.
The dynamic between these three
unique, fascinating characters played
by outstanding actresses has been a
real driving force behind what has
made Grey’s Anatomy so gripping and
irresistible as of late, a much-needed
change of tone for the long-running
drama. There is much uncertainty
surrounding this tumour: Amelia’s
plan may not work, Nicole’s time is
running out, she is having to deal
with the worsening symptoms that
are slowly but surely creeping up on
her, and Arizona needs to keep it
together to learn from the best, but
also to watch a friend possibly die in
the process.
The show effectively builds up
the drama to its climax episode of
the date of the actual brain surgery.
Amelia, troubled by insecurities and
doubts, at one point demands that
someone call her brother for help,
who is all the way out in the East
Coast in Washington D.C. (the show
is set in Seattle, the West Coast). Will
she be able to make it through what
is scheduled to be a 15-hour surgery?
Can Dr Herman survive such a
punishing procedure? There is a sense
that the show dramatises its medical
scenes far too much: an unconvincing
act of what can be seen as last-minute
heroism in the surgery is really
pushing it: but ultimately, it makes
great television.
Another smash-hit in terms of
ratings is audience-favourite, Scandal,
perhaps the most blatantly feminism-
pushing show on air right now.
What with Mellie (Bellamy Young)
lamenting over the fair point of how
the job of picking out the White
House china pattern would be a paid
position if a man had to do it, and
with protagonist Olivia Pope (Kerry
Washington) telling off the President
of the United States/her on-off
boyfriend Fitz (Tony Goldwyn) for
using the word “bitch” to describe a
hard-working, opinionated female
staff member in the White House,
this fast-paced political thriller
has room to stand up for its female
characters in the midst of creating the
most outrageous plot lines. The more
ridiculous the show gets, the better.
It is a show centring on larger-than-
life characters thrown in impossible
situations. Despite its male characters
being in various positions of power,
the show is at its most fun when the
female characters get into the action.
Olivia Pope fixes problems like
no other, and has been for the past
four years. Rigging elections, helping
out victims of sexual harassment,
uncovering plots, working on political
campaigns, and also finding time for
romance, her talent knows no bounds.
Her longest love interest Fitzgerald
Grant is the most frustrating, mopey,
sappy character ever to grace the
small screen, and the other man, Jake
"Welcome
back ladies,
and long
may you
rule the
world of
primetime
television."
"To quote
Chelsea
Handler in
This Means
War, “get
out there,
you get
flexible!."
Julianna Margulies kicks butt as Alicia Florrick in
The Good Wife
Drs Amelia Shepherd, Arizona Robbins (top left + right), and Nicole
Herman (bottom) are surgeons who never give up in Grey’s Anatomy
Ballard (Scott Foley) fares no better in
his whiny portrayal of jealousy. But
with Fitz, we get the invaluable Mellie
Grant, his wife, pitching up playing
bigger and bigger roles, injecting
some fiery passion into the show. She
is willing to do just about anything
for what she considers is right, and
as she exudes vibrant confidence
walking up and down the corridors
of The White House, it is no wonder
she has become such a valuable player
in the show. She has big plans for her
political future, and we cannot wait
to see how big of a role she will be
given in the future. Her screen time
is increasing by the minute, and the
excellent Bellamy Young who rapid-
fires her lines of dialogue throwing in
all sorts of emotions into her delivery
is a joy to watch. Another stand-out
female presence only appearing
in a guest appearance capacity is
Khandi Alexander, playing Maya
Pope, Olivia’s duplicitous, terrorist,
murderous mother. Evil maternal
figures often end up being the most
interesting, keeping us all guessing
until the very end as to where their
loyalties truly lie. Khandi Alexander
has tons of fun with her role, one
that was offered to her without an
audition, and she fits perfectly into
the crazy narrative of the show
effortlessly.
Season 4 of Once Upon a Time
kicked things off by immediately
cashing in on the success of Disney’s
Frozen, by introducing Elsa (Georgina
Haig), perhaps the most independent,
feminist Disney princess ever, into
the weird and wonderful town of
"Scandal
[is] perhaps
the most
blatantly
feminism-
pushing
show on air
right now."
Storybrooke. This move paid off,
seeing the season 4 premiere peak in
its ratings. The ice-controlling queen
is dead-set on her quest to find her
sister Anna (Elizabeth Lail), and later,
the main villain of the first half of
the season, the powerful Snow Queen
(Elizabeth Mitchell) appears for a
magical showdown. ABC’s fantasy-
adventure show has the advantage of
having an abundance of characters
to work with, and when it introduced
elements of Frozen it was off to a good
start. But with the show’s budget
being what it is, it never makes full
use of its powerful characters. The
action sequences always, always fall
short, but making up for its childish,
almost embarrassing scenes of what
is supposed to be excitement, is
the often very smart background
"Yes, the
Queens of
Darkness
have
arrived,
and they
are of
course
up to no
good."
Olivia Pope (top), Mellie Grant (bottom left), and Maya Pope (bottom
right) keep things fiery in Scandal
stories of new characters that are
incorporated into existing ones. Plus,
if you feel as though a certain story
arc is running out of steam, the show
does the smart thing of splitting its
seasons into two halves essentially,
wrapping up the first half’s plot lines,
and teasing new ones for the coming
months. So as of this moment, the
Frozen storyline has finished, and the
show is getting ready to turn into a
whole new direction.
Yes, the Queens of Darkness have
arrived, and they are of course up
to no good. The three most iconic
female villains of Disney Classics,
Maleficent (Kristin Bauer van
Straten), Ursula (Merrin Dungey)
and Cruella De Vil (Victoria Smurfit),
are teaming up, and with this lineup
the show should have plenty of fun
with them. They have done wonders
bringing the animated characters to
their live-action form. Maleficent
is fully equipped with her staff and
black outfit with horns, Cruella has
the unforgettable black-and-white
hair with her humongous fur coat,
and even Ursula, who the costume
designers have taken the most
creative liberty with, looks like the
Ocean Queen that she is, complete
with CGI tentacles. This is a welcome
return for Maleficent, who was killed
in an earlier season, and first-time
appearances for Ursula and Cruella,
who, so far, are making this trio
work. Given the track record of this
show, perhaps it would be unwise to
expect a full-blown battle of sorts
between good and evil, but there
is a dark past and secret hinted at
between the three evil queens, and
the technically “good” residents of
Storybrooke. Mary Margaret/Snow
White (Ginnifer Goodwin) and
David/Prince Charming (Josh Dallas)
in particular are troubled by the
arrival of these impeccably dressed
and spoken, scheming women. Just
how were the villains entangled in the
lives of the heroes in the past? Only
time will tell.
Speaking of scheming women, the
show Revenge has certainly jumped
the shark big time but the women of
the series are no closer to giving their
quest for vengeance a rest. Emily
Thorne (Emily VanCamp) has had
it in to ruin the Grayson family for
a long time, mainly feuding with
Victoria Grayson (Madeleine Stowe),
who destroyed her father, David
Clarke (James Tupper). There have
been many successful takedowns
as Emily’s never-ending resources,
along with her martial arts skills and
general all-rounded ninja abilities
have served her well in chipping away
at the Grayson family fortune and
reputation. Ever since the absolute
worst twist in the world that took
place at the end of the show’s third
season, in which David Clarke who
was supposed to be dead actually
turned out to be alive, the show has
never been the same, forcing silly
plots and throwaway characters to
clunkily push along with filling out
The Queens of Darkness have arrived: (from left to right) Maleficent, Cruella de Vil, and Ursula get ready to
give fairytale villains a bad name in the second half of Once Upon a Time’s fourth season

half of Once Upon a Time’s fourth season
