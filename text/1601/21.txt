THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 31
FELIX 13.03.2015
With the energetic midfield pairing
of Ryan Jude and Harry Kwong, and
the dynamism of the Italian stallion
David Villa (an even better player
than his namesake), the squad is
ready to show why ICUAFC have
dominated the Varsity football
fixtures over the years.

With half of last year’s team
graduating, it was uncertain what
kind of team the 1st would be this
year. But with some fantastic fresher
intake it has been one of the team’s
most successful seasons in a long
time.
After a short teething period, the
team have managed to pull out an
outstanding performance, time
and time again. The 1st have now
been unbeaten in both their LUSL
and BUCS leagues since the 5th of
November – this is an incredible 17
games on the trot UNBEATEN! The
ridiculous goal difference of 239 goals
from 8 games in the LUSL league
must also be pointed out. This is just
testament to our equally brilliant
defending and attacking skills.
It also must be mentioned that the
1st have already beaten the medics
this season in the LUSL cup semi-
final - even with one of our key
shooters missing. The team’s real
warm-up to varsity will be the LUSL
cup final against RVC 1st – finally
some decent competition for us. So
watch out medics, the winners just
keep winning.

Following on from the incredible
victory at last year’s varsity we have
only gone from strength to strength.
The season has provided some well
fought battles and we continue to lose
deliberately as to not intimidate the
other teams, in LUSL especially this
has proven most effective.
There is lots of fresh new blood
(mostly spiked with alcohol from
Ministry the night before) but the
young pups will no doubt rise to the
occasion. Watch out for Eloise in
defence and Alexis…all over the court!

The 4’s have been training hard all
term with extra Kondi fitness sessions
and friendly matches outside of
BUCS to ensure we are on top game
for Varsity this year.
With only a few more trainings left
to perfect our tactics and techniques
we can’t wait to get on court and show
the Medics how it’s done!
Let’s go IC!

The remarkable dedication of the
girls from IC fives has led to the great
improvement in the team’s play since
the start of LUSLs. The team proudly
includes fresh faces of IC netball,
less experienced but nevertheless
committed.
With the more experienced players
from last year guiding the team,
trainings and games have never been
more fulfilling and fun-filled. As the
girls of IC fives sharpen their play
through the LUSL games and various
friendlies, there has been increasing
numbers of wins as Varsity draws
near.
The last two games of the LUSL cup
have greatly boosted morale as IC
fives beat University of Arts 30-13 in
a fast-paced game and came off with
a 16-5 victory against Roehampton
College. Nothing scares the fifth team
as we fight on. The few unfortunate
injuries and the few games lost to our
opponents mean nothing compared
to our unfazed determination to play
our best at Varsity. Definitely coming
back harder and stronger. Hold your
breath and be impressed.
ICSM 2s have had a fantastic year of
netball in both our BUCs and LUSL
leagues. After a hard season last year
with a loss to IC at varsity, the 2s have
fought back with a huge amount of
determination and fighting spirit,
and with some talented new additions
the 2s have gone from strength
to strength this season, proving
themselves to be a formidable team.
We currently stand unbeaten in
LUSL with a promotion already in
the bag, and lie 2nd in BUCs having
very narrowly missed out on a second
promotion. The team is now hungry
for a victory at Varsity.
Our defensive unit GD -Maddison
Gronager and GK- Eleanor Tindall,
will not be making it easy for IC, and
watch out for Elizabeth Dunne as
she makes some flying interceptions,
securing turn overs that GA Megan
Thomas and GS Shade Oyewole will
certainly be capitalizing on. IC should
definitely be nervous.

ICSM 3s are a team of insanely
trained athletes, whose presence and
skills will make even the finest teams
crumble to their knees. We have
had a brilliant year, with excellent
game both on and off the court. Our
fierce play and unbeatable shooting
skills have led us to huge victories,
including a 56-0 thrashing and see us
set to finish at the top of LUSL.
Our strong team bond, love of
Taylor Swift and dedication to the
game means there is no doubt we will
smash varsity this year. Be scared
IC, we’re coming for you and look
forward to watch you crumble…
Having just missed out on a spot
for LUSL promotion, the 4s are ready
to take on Varsity! Despite losing
key players at the start of the season,
motivation runs high and the 4s have
continued to improve. I have every
faith that we will secure a victory
come Varsity having seen the growth
of not only the players individually
but the team as a whole into a family
of fun and enthusiastic girls who may
lack in height, but are blessed with
speed and skill.
Although defence will miss the
presence of Nat Ilenkovan, IC will
still have a hard time evading our
defenders. IC better also watch out for
Lizzy Kostov, looking to dominate
centre court for one last time, leaving
nothing behind but Kostov Carnage.

Following a nail-biter of a game last
year, ICSM 5s (‘The Dream Team’)
have been ready for the big day for a
long time coming. The development
and sheer strength of this team is
clearly evident in the incredible
unbeaten run we sustained at the start
of this season, the cracking score lines
we have produced and the occasional
Monday circles we’ve had to introduce
because let’s face it, such greatness
deserves celebration!
With the arrival of a few new
players and the formation of a
beautiful new defensive partnership,
in the unlikely event that IC find
themselves with possession of the ball,
they will be lucky to get any shots past
the arms of Millie Ahmed and Suki
Nahl. Our formidable centre court
will then be on hand to swiftly deliver
the ball back to our triad of shooters,
who with a LUSL goal difference of
+156 this season need no introduction.
Having already annihilated IC
4s 39-14 this season, ICSM 5s are
confident that we shall bring in
the first of many medic wins with
nothing short of a landslide victory.
Be warned IC, we shall not be using
the first quarter to warm up this year!

The 1s this year have had an
incredible season; marred only by
the time we played, and drew, with
the medics. We are looking forward
to putting our expertise that has
come from winning all but 1 of our
BUCS games into truly smashing
the medics and showing them how
