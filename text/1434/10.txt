Imperial takes on Metric
position in it than I think I ever had.
A band can record a song, put it on the
internet and have two thousand fans
overnight. As far as I am concerned,
the death of the record industry is the
best thing that’s ever happened to mu-
sic. Get those fuckers out of the way!
CW: You’ve supported lots of
bands, who would you say was a
favourite?
JS: Its not going to get better than The
Stones. Well, I guess if you could go

Stag and Dagger festival fun
Ever since his mainstream debut with
The Slim Shady LP back in 1999,
Eminem has been synonymous with
controversy and shameless bad taste,
whilst being responsible for some of
the most verbally and graphically ex-
plicit lyrics to have ever aired. It’s one
of the main reasons he gained such
massive attention and appeal across
the world, and this shock value didn’t
subside through out the release of his
following 3 albums over the next 5
years.
All of this of course is no news to any
listener of hip-hop and rap. But what is
surprising, is that, after a 5-year hiatus
he has managed to surpass himself in
his latest outing, in the form of his and
Hesham Farag
back in time and open for the Beatles,
but I think Rolling Stones, Madison
Square Gardens, is kind of like one of
those gigs that nothing is ever going to
come close to. It was pretty awesome.
CW: Are you playing any UK festi-
vals this summer?
JS: Yeah, I think we’re doing Glaston-
bury, one of the wireless shows in Hyde
Park, and then Reading and Leeds.
CW: What’s your favourite
festival?
JS: I really like Coachella, I’ve never
played Glastonbury, Reading’s like a
massive Carling-fest. It great if you like
swimming in a giant vat of Carling.
CW: I think it’s changed, the Car-
ling branding has been removed
so you might have a different
beer to swim in this year
JS: Wow, imagine if it were all orange
juice…
Slim again, Eminem returns from a shady break
Dr Dre’s love child: Relapse.
As some of you may know, he has
spent part of this time in rehab for ad-
diction to sleeping pills, and as anyone
who saw him on Friday Night with
Jonathan Ross last week will find hard
to believe, he has now been sober for
over a year.
This is a point he will not let you
forget throughout the record, starting
with the intro, which is a humorous
mock-up of his discharge from hos-
pital, starring Dominic West, better
known as Jimmy McNulty from the
T.V. series The Wire.
Other than this new subject that he
has introduced to his material, much
of the same themes from his previous
releases remain, including; his mother,
drugs, violence and sex. The latter of
which is incorporated into the track,
Insane, (which by the way, is fucking
insane! And not it in the good way,
but rather the way in which it was first
intended) by way of a rather graphic
description of one of my less favourite
sexual practices: felching. [Ed note: see
urbandictionary.com]
He then goes on to fondly reminisce
about the times spent luring women
into his car, alluding to Lindsay Lo-
Flat Sharp
han (whom he affectionately refers to
as a c*nt) and Britney Spears, in Same
Song & Dance, the title referring to the
struggle they put up as he gags them to
facilitate what you can probably guess
will follow. This track serves to remind
us that he still obtains an extremely
vivid imagination and ability for just as
vivid story telling (or so we hope).
Then comes my favourite part of the
album, the second single, We Made
You, or rather the backing vocals it
contains, beautifully supplied by soul
singer Charmagne Tripp. Which helps
break up the monotony of a weak,
pop-culture reference soaked pop
song, which at times sounds like it was
made with a mind on it’s music video
prospects.
Eventually we arrive at a song that
I was expecting (but not hoping for)
more of in the album, a heartfelt retell-
ing of his gradual demise to prescrip-
tion medication. Déjà vu is scattered
with excuses and lies that he makes
in order to convince himself he needs
to take the pills he’s taking and paints
a lucid picture of the course an ad-
dict’s mind takes on it’s way down, not
typical Eminem, but a decent track
nonetheless.
Towards the end of the CD you begin
to miss the old Eminem, why’s he try-
ing to sing? Why’s he putting on these
shitty voices? Until you reach the 20th
track of this 20 track album, Under-
ground. He’s back! The same, aggres-
sive, flowing, dark Eminem we’ve been
familiar with for so many years. Why
did he have to leave it until the very
end before he re-emerged?
You would expect the music behind
the lyrics to be pretty good considering
it’s an entirely Dr. Dre production, and
nothing less should be expected from a
music producer who has a PhD in ex-
actly that (Haha).
And yeah, they’re alright, not up to
what I was expecting, but by any nor-
mal standards they certainly raise the
quality of the album above that based
on the other components alone. How-
ever we aren’t concerned with normal
standards here. What I was expecting
was one of the longest running pro-
ducers in this genre to make some-
thing special, and he hasn’t, which is
disappointing.
That’s not to say that it’s all crap, by
no means is that the case, there are still
2 or 3 tracks that boast his talent, one
that stands out especially being: Old
Times Sake, which reeks of old Dr Dre
and Eminem when they were at the top
of their collaborative game and it’s a
shame that hasn’t seeped into the rest
of the album.
As I listen, I can’t help but think: Dr
Dre has an album of his own due out
this year, he would have made plenty of
beats for it, obviously kept the best of
them for himself, but what to do with
those that are usable but not quite up
to high standard? Use them for a col-
laborating artist’s album also coming
out soon? Maybe.
So what I am I saying? I certainly
wouldn’t spend money on it, but it’s
definitely worth a free download and a
listen every now and then if only just
for the entertainment that his humor-
ous lyrics have to offer as it should still
be appreciated that there are few art-
ists around to stretch the boundaries
anywhere near to the extent of Mar-
shall Mathers.
So yes, I’m glad he’s back, I just wish
he came back the way he left. In one
of the interludes (Steve Berman, skit)
a brief reference is made to him hav-
ing made 2 albums during his time
out, if that bares any truth at all, I just
wonder…

Stag & Dagger is a music event where
lots of exciting new bands get to-
gether and all play on one day, in one
city. So you buy a wristband in the
early evening and stagger around from
venue to venue trying to catch as many
bands as possible as you get progres-
sively beered up before crashing on a
sofa in the small hours of the morning
at the final venue where electro DJs try
to keep you dancing.
I went up to t’north to the Leeds one,
but it also takes place in London and
Glasgow every year. The wonderful
thing is that for the price it would cost
to see one band, you can see several,
and be exposed perhaps to new bands
you wouldn’t have chosen to see when
they play on their own. In turn, the
bands get people coming to see them
live who perhaps wouldn’t have heard
of them before and may become fans.
It’s a bit like the Camden Crawl but
with equally good bands for half the
price. Heres a review of each band I
chose to see, but I missed out on some
amazing bands such as the Mae Shi,
Twilight Sad, White Denim, and the
Manhattan Love Suicides because of
time clashes.
Abe Vigoda 7:30pm
The venue was packed to see this band,
as they were the most high profile band
playing this early and no doubt every-
one wanted to check out if they live up
to the hype they’ve been getting from
numerous music publications. They
play a kind of hypnotic surf-punk a lit-
tle like if Wavves was fueled
with alcohol instead of
marijuana.
Their music probably tries
to capture the lazy bore-
dom and frustration of
their homeland, Califor-
nia. To my ears, it’s some
kind of tropical blend of
ambient backgrounds
and punk rhythms. I
was pretty excited to
see them because I’ve
been enjoying their
album, Skeleton, for a
while now. Live they
lose some of their
surf-y echo replacing
it with louder more
chaotic noisiness,
but they definitely
don’t disappoint.
Crystal Antlers 8:30pm
I didn’t know anything
about this band before I
saw them and I was plan-
ning on going to see King
Creosote instead, but
once they took to the
stage I was transfixed
(and also had most of a
pint to finish).
Their music sounds
like psychadelic garage
rock with howling vo-
cals and one crazy guy
who just bashes the
hell out of various percussion
instruments with the energy
of a madman. I have since
gone home and tried to lis-
ten to them on record but it
just isn’t as good as the live
experience.
Vivian Girls 9:50pm
My review of Vivian Girls was, I think, the second thing I wrote for
the felix last year when I was annoyed that felix was mostly covering
bands like Coldplay and Keene which anyone with ears is already
bored to tears with. Brooklyn’s coolest ladies were just as good this
time, if not better.
However that might just be because I’m more familiar with their
music now so it’s even catchier and cuter than before. I still think
they’re glorious. Unfortunately I spent most of the set waiting in
the queue for the bar, but I can tell you they sound just
as good when you are facing away from
them.
Telepathe 10:50pm
I still haven’t worked out how
Telepathe is supposed to be pro-
nounced despite asking several
people, “Is it telepath/telepathy/
tele-pathy?” there didn’t seem to
be any consensus on the matter.
Telepathe are two girls in mens’ t-
shirts with lots of keyboards, and
they were amazing. If you haven’t
heard of Telepathe, I can guaran-
tee you will pretty soon when they get
scooped up by mainstream newspaper
journalists who like to tell squares what’s
hip.
I would describe them as
electro-pop but that would
make you think of music like
Little Boots and they couldn’t
be further from that sort of con-
trived lowest-common-denomi-
nator rubbish.
Cursive 11:50pm
When I got to this venue there was
already a crowd of scrawny boys
with emo haircuts and moshing
tendencies surrounding the stage,
but no-one should let this put them
off a band as enjoyable as Cursive.
Yes, their music is the sort of Amer-
ican indie punk that appeals to the
teenager within you, but don’t feel bad
about it! I think that perhaps for some of us, watching this band
was a bit of a guilty pleasure, but we revelled in it, dancing and sing-
ing along.
The highlight was when they played an only just recognisable cov-
er of Beyonce’s “Single ladies”, showing that this is a band that doesn’t
take itself seriously, unlike the majority of slightly emo indie bands
made up of middle-aged men.
CW: So its been four years since
your last record ‘Live It Out’ does
the way your new album ‘Fanta-
sies’ was written greatly differ?
JS: It was different in the sense that
we sort of started more from scratch
than we’ve ever started before. When
we made ‘Live it Out’ we had been
touring for like three years straight on
‘Old World Underground’, writing as
we were going. ‘Live it Out’ it was just
kind of a representation of what we
had been doing on tour for so long so
when we got back together to start the
process of writing and recording the
new record, it was more like us design-
ing what we wanted to sound like for
the future than representing what we
already started to sound like.
CW: I imagine you were pretty
frustrated when your record
leaked on the internet?
JS: We respond by streaming the al-
bum in its entirety the same day, and
you know what, it feels like it’s only
helped. I know that statistically illegal
file sharing, but I don’t feel like it hurts
us. I mean I don’t feel it’s right. I feel
like if I were going down the street and
see a front door open, I’m not going to
go in and nick their toaster. If I was,
then I guess I would be OK with steal-
ing music too. People hide behind their
computers in a lot of ways. If you’re a
thief, go on and steal your music but
if you’re a great person and you don’t
steal anything else ever, I’m not totally
sure why you would steal music.
CW: So what do you have to do
to try and keep an album under
wraps and not leak before its
release?
JW: We finished our record and sat
on it for six months. It only started
leaking only when we sent it out to
the industry, which is really ironic be-
cause it’s the industry who are always
complaining that they don’t have any
jobs anymore. But where do the leaks
come from? I mean for me musically,
the only real downside is that I’ve
spent a couple of years of my life try-
ing to make that record as good as it
can possibly be and every single sonic
little quality has a lot to do with that. If
someone gets an [illegally] download-
ed copy, I don’t know what that sounds
like. It kind of makes me feel like all the
energy that I may have put into these
songs and their production has all kind
of been futile, because there could be
someone blog reviewing the wrong
version of the song. Everyone now just
dreams about making a million dollars
off their blog, but try not to use my
music to make that happen.
CW: I’ve heard Broken Social
Scene are working on a new
album, can we expect any metric
involvement?
JS: I hope so, it just all depends on the
timings of it all.
CW: Do you think the break, with
everyone’s solo stuff has enriched
the band?
JS: Yeah I think so; a band is like some
sort of weird medium between mar-
riage, and family. You have to stay re-
ally committed to both the idea and the
people, what really helps that commit-
ment lasts is that you constantly make
the decision to be part of it, and when
the band gives you freedom it makes
it a lot easier. I think the fact that we
exercised some freedom really helped
everyone come back with fresh ears
and a fresh mind, and we don’t have
the idea that we’re stuck together.
CW: The production of fantasies
sounds a lot bigger, and perhaps
more polished, contrasting with
the raw feel of ‘Live it Out’. Was
that a conscious decision dictated
by the new direction in sound?
JS: We tried a lot of different sounds
and production ideas until what felt
comfortable made itself apparent. The
album is probably more influenced by
the last chapter of 2001 than any band
or record, we watched that a lot. ‘Jupi-
ter and beyond the infinite’ I think it’s
called. It’s more imagery like that than
like preferential sound.
CW: You put this record out your-
self. Is that because you don’t feel
satisfied with working with major
labels?
JS: In my experience major labels have
one way of working, and if you happens
to be one of the 300 bands that it works
for, great. If you aren’t, then you’re go-
ing to get fucked. The record compa-
nies all know that they’re fucked too,
but I don’t feel that way about music,
I feel more optimistic about my own

Apologies, Tytus
The review we published last week of Fleet Foxes
was not by Victoria Brzezinski as was printed, but
by Tytus Murphy. Sorry, Tytus! We can’t change
what’s already printed but we hope you appreciate a
printed apology. After sitting in felix’s dingy base-
ment office for hours on end staring at a screen the
size of Africa, your eyesight starts to deteriorate and
it’s surprisingly easy to miss your mistakes.
