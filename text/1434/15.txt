How to play:
It’s quite simple, all numbers are in a
cell and must be surrounded with a
corresponding number of lines. Lines
cannot split and there can only be one
continuous line. Any cells with no
numbers can have any number of lines.

So which London tube station sums to 134?
This week’s Cat Phone:
_ _ _ _ _
Each letter in the alphabet is assigned a
value, 1-26 (see table) and when added
together for a specific word the sum
equals the total shown. All you have to
do is scan and send the Underground
station that is hidden each week to su-
doku.felix@imperial.ac.uk
Wordoku is identical to Sudoku;
we’ve just replaced numbers
with letters. Complete the puzzle
and then send the whole grid to
sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
You will not get credit for just the
word alone. It’s not an anagram.
Mentalist Maze...
I like how people are finding ingeniuos
ways of solving this little brain
tickler. The felix team really like what
Giramundu does to solve the solution,
however, he was beaten by Alistair
Larsson who also said that Nick Jones
was shit. This thing is quite difficult,
maybe we should offer double points?

It’s them again folks, MÖchten sie

should tickle your brain a bit!

Nonogram 1,434
How to play:
Nonograms are logic puzzles in which cells
in a grid have to be coloured or left blank ac-
cording to numbers at the side of the grid.
The numbers measure how many unbroken
lines or filled-in squares there are in any given
row or column. Look at the solution for help.
Non of you listened to our orders alst week,
because MÖchten sie mein Manscaft were
the winners of the nonogram yet again. But
I can say that everyone is getting quicker at
getting the solutions sent in, so lets see how
well you do with this one.

Hangman
Black hole found in
Union finance offices
A
llegedly... After months
(minutes) of investiga-
tion the Hangman team
has made a shocking dis-
covery that will likely (or
not at all) shake the Union to its very
core. The Union Finance Offices, situ-
ated in the North-East corner of Beit
Quad, are currently hosting a black
hole.
The body, first hypothised in 1783
is at the time of writing three metres
in diameter and growing fast. Sir Rob-
ert Pinkelson, Head of Black Hole re-
search in the Geology Department has
labelled the discovery ‘astonishing’.
“The Pinkelson black hole is the first
black hole of its size to be discovered on
Earth. From an experimental point of
view, it could offer a ton of information
before it destroys the Earth completely,
exterminating mankind with it.”
The news has come as a shock to
Union finance staff but some have ex-
pressed relief, Miss Tyworth had this
to say: “Stuff kept going missing, in-
voices, cheques, payment slips, it was
all very embarrassing. But now obvi-
ously there’s an explanation, it was the
Tyworth black hole all along!”
The future remains uncertain for
staff in the Finance Office. Union
President Jenny Morgan has refused to
give the staff leave while the black hole
crisis is addressed and due to a lack of
space in the Union, has been unable
to move the finance office elsewhere,
“There simply isn’t anywhere to put
them and the Union finance work can’t
simply grind to a halt. I don’t mean to
be unkind, but they’ll have to put up
with the Morgan black hole until a bet-
ter solution can be devised.”
The College have seized on this dis-
covery as another reason for the Union
to hand over the running of it’s financ-
es, to the College Finance Department.
The Head of the College Finance De-
partment, Baron Von Steam-a-lot, had
this to say to Hangman. “It’s obvious
that the Union can’t keep a hold of
it’s finances. They aren’t efficient at
processing payments, they can’t keep
a track of what money has gone where
and as this latest depacle highlights,
their finances are full of black holes!
I’m just glad the Steam-a-lot black hole
was spotted so quickly before more
damage could be done!”
As the argument ensues the black
hole continues to grow at an alarming
rate, with no valid solutions at present.
Hangman’s correspondent at CERN
has told us that scientists there are
privately pleased about the black hole,
with one commenting, “I told you it
wouldn’t be us!!!”
(At least if the world ended, I wouldn’t
have to stay up all night de-shitifying
your page Hangman! -Ed)
The black hole has made going for lunch just that little bit harder
In wake of catering scandal, douchebag felix
reporters... still eat at Union
A
llegedly... Last week, the
felix news team (tossers)
issued a damning verdict
on the state of catering in
the Union. They showed
that most students were unhappy with
the quality of food and the quality of
service; skillfully delivering their mes-
sage with the question “Would you eat
from this?”.
The Hangman team isn’t sure how
most students responded to this ques-
tion (or whether they asked “No, who
the fuck eats out of a chip fryer?”) but
we do know how the felix news team
(tossers) answered.
Jovan Nedic (Editor-in-Little Chef),
Kadhim Shubber (Who shot the
Deputy Editor) and Dan Wan (Editor-
erect) have all been spotted eating at
the Union since their ‘bold’ expose of
the Union’s catering. The Hangman’s
‘food-from-a-distance’ expert told
us that they enjoyed a slightly over
Imperial’s
apartheid regime
under attack
A
llegedly... In a stunning
blow to the credibility
of the apartheid regime
at Imperial College Lon-
don, Labour MP Diane
Abbott has sparked a fresh debate on
the science university’s policy of dis-
criminating against black and minority
students.
At a Westminster Hall debate on
the 20th of May, Ms Abbott (Winner
of the Spectator Speech award 2008),
bravely declared (or might not have)
that “there is an unspoken apartheid at
Imperial, as a member of this House,
my conscience cannot let this injustice
remain unspoken any longer!”
Hangman’s Parliamentary affairs
correspondent (co-conspirator) said
that the House rose to triumphant
applause, with one MP commenting,
“Tears swelled up in my eyes, possibly
the most emotive speech given in this
House’s history.”
Her comments were less warmly re-
cieved at Imperial College, where the
Rector, Sir Roy Anderson, is reported
to have dropped his monocle into his
tea on hearing the news.
In a formal statement, after his fa-
mous temper had subsided, Sir Roy
called Ms Abbott’s speech “A careless
and dishonest slander on the reputa-
tion of Imperial College.” He rejected
the label ‘apartheid’ and blamed (or he
might not have) the smallness of Impe-
rial’s black population on the failure
of black applicants to meet Imperial’s
entry requirements, citing the work of
biologist James D. Watson.
Inspired by Ms Abbott’s speech,
protestors have begun to congregate
outside the Houses of Parliament,
pledging to remain until the govern-
ment cuts its links with Imperial. Join-
ing, among others, the Tamil protes-
tors already there, this move looks
certain to make Parliament Square the
most densely populated area on Earth.
Dan Wan you naughty boy,
put the archives down!
