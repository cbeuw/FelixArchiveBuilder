Cancer
So back to this
American whale.
Before you are
violently crushed to
death, you did manage
to find that most
elusive point in a lady- her natural frequency.
This will happen on the fourth shag. As you are
bashing her from behind, you start to slap her
arse, varying amplitude her bum wobbles like
jelly until it splits open.
Virgo
Oh you have taken
your last exam, and
are leaving Imperial.
Looking back there
are some things that
you will have done
differently, and others that will bring a smile
to your face. However, remember that these
stories will remain useless and remain cooped
up in your head. We here at felix bid you a fond
farewell, please drop by soon.
Gemini
Молим, немају
Српски? Сачемо ми
бидети, јебемлити
мајку фашистичку!
See, now if they kept
the language courses,
you’d be able to understand that.
Pisces
In this weeks exam
you realise that there
is someone sitting
in your seat. You try
to tell them to move
but all you get back is
“chill out bro, there’s more to life than where you
sit in the exams.” You look at him and say “Not
when there’s a knife in your back.” OK so it’s exam
season and we’re struggling a little bit, but don’t
worry folks, we’ll be back on form next week...
Leo
This week, felix brings
you a new angle on
facebook rape. Forget
about adding them to
every gay group known
to man and adding
everyone on there as their friends, the hilarity
factor may be large, as they will be getting a lot of
gay friends, but it won’t be the ultimate rape. Next
time try this... just delete their account. That’s
right everyone, welcome to Facebook Murder!
Aries
This week you finish
exams, get rather
inebriated and take
a rather large Ameri-
can girl home. Me-
andering home you
stop off at a few offies to pick up the chavtastic
drink that is Smernoff Ice to ensure that you
don’t sober up. Once home you are shagging
like bunnies on speed. Come morning she will
have crushed you to death. She was a big ‘un.
Scorpio
You come to find that
your facebook has been
epically raped. In a fit of
rage, you tear open a can
of whoop-ass, ripping
out their hair with your
teeth, ramming it down their eyes and pulling it
through their nose. Facebook Death has taken a
new meaning, but then you realise that it wasn’t
your facebook, someone else logged onto your
computer. Life sentacnce coming your way.
Libra
Still with this
American, you run out
of johnies, but lets face
it- you are both still
rampant as fuck. She
assures you that you
can pull out before your white army is released.
You think meah, why not? Her offer of going on
top is a winner. Just as you are about to explode,
she drops all of her weight onto you, screaming
“be the father of my baby”. You cannot pull out.
Taurus
It’s far too soon for
baby p jokes, but not
too soon fo the fuck
head parents of the
poor baby, so here we
go. You try to hide
what you’ve done, but the legal system gets you
(a little too late, but better late than never). The
judge sends you to jail where you get shunned by
murderers and thiefs alike. Whilst asleep in your
cell one night, a bunch of them come with the
warden and hand you a piece of rope. ‘Do the
honourable thing like Shipman did, otherwise
we’ll rape you ourself and then slit your eyes
out!” Die assholes die! (Fair? Ed)
Horoscopes, still the same shit but a different issue

up! Anyway, here’s another one for you all.

I think we can push this
American a little further.
After she screams that
she wants you to father
her baby, she refuses to
get off of you. You strug-
gle to breath and bash her side, hoping to find that
natural frequency and shift her off. As the last atom
of oxygen is squeezed out of you, you pass out and
die. When you get to heaven, God sends you to hell
for shagging Lady Gaga. Ha ha, Fail. Pint?

This week you sit an
exam. Not all that
surprising seeing
as it is exams time.
Opening the paper,
you erupt with glee!
You can actually do it for once... and looking at
questions 2 and 4 you realise that they were on
the past paper you went through this morning
as revision. You stand up and splaff all over the
paper. You are asked to leave and get zero.

Battle of the James’...
Jesse John
Known as: His Majesty, James VI, by
the Grace of God King of England,
Scotland, France and Ireland, Defender
of the Faith, etc.
Nationality: Scottish
Favourite Weapon: Well he had a
massive army at his disposal. I really
wouldn’t mess with this dude
Criminal Record: None. HE IS THE
LAW!
Interesting Facts: During the Jaco-
bean era his people enjoyed uninter-
rupted peace and comparatively low
taxation. Once in power, Charles I
(James’ successor) and Buckingham
sanctioned a series of reckless military
expeditions that ended in humiliating
failure. James bequeathed Charles a
fatal belief in the divine right of kings,
combined with a disdain for Parlia-
ment, which culminated in the English
Civil War and the execution of Charles.

Team Shotgun finally take the first set of points
this week, however, will they continue to collect
the points over the next couple of pages? Well
you’ll have to read to find out.
Again, like we pointed out last week, we want
you to try and form a sentance with the words/
phrases in the dingbats in order to get the points,
so lets see what Team Shotgun came up with.

Imagine that (4), a bad spell of weather (1)
here in the UK! Well it’s up to you (3), you can
either run to the forest (6), or you can run down
the hill and fall head over heels (2) and crack
your crown. Nothing you see here is recycled

want the points so we can beat MÖchten sie

King
Check this bitchin’ contribution to my notes
26 felix Friday 29 May 2009
Known for: Being one bad-ass, gun
slicking outlaw in the Wild West
Nationality: Confederate American
Favourite weapon: Smith and West-
ern revolver
Criminal Record: Massive. He robbed
banks and killed people
Interesting Facts: The news of his
death was questioned by many as they
thought that his was a hoax, until in
1995 they dug up his corps and used
DNA testing with relatives to confirm
that it was actually him. Let’s face it,
this guy was an absolute legend. Even
when he was alive, people thought that
he was amazing, and it was only after
his assasination that his ideology and
actions propelled him to legendry sta-
tus. Plus he was portrayed by Brad Pitt
who is a bit of a lad, therefore by direct
contrast, Jesse James was the biggest
pimp daddy of them all.
Known for: Winning a pie eating con-
test against some really skinny runts
to win the race to be Deputy President
(Welfare) next year
Nationality: Maccam, wait no, that’s
not right... it’s that other northern
one... Geordie!
Favourite Weapon: The ladder of his
stupid old fire engine that they all call
Jezebel. I think he secretly wants to be
at one with old Jez, poor girl
Criminal Record: None, we think
Interesting Facts: Apart from his
fondness of pies and classic vehicles,
John also has a fascination with sailing
the high seas and is in fact a meme-
ber of the University Royal Naval Unit
where they go around in little dingy’s
playing battleship all day. But then the
big aircraft carriers come along and
absolutely shit all over their little boats.
Oh well...

Do your notes have any contributions so bitchin’
that you think that the rest of Imperial needs to
see it? Well if the answers yes then send them to
sudoku.felix@ic.ac.uk.
We should all be thankful to the artists who
give up their free time to draw the images that
have graced this space because lets face it, revi-
sion is boring and a comical penis right bang in
the middle of your notes doesn’t half brighten
things up. So let the penises march on!
Finally how come va-j-j’s are nowhere near as
funny? Sorry ladies, they’re just not.

angman has got bloody
bored with reading
about Ravi Pall’s life
each and every bloody
week. Therefore we’ve
locked him in the basement and taken
over his column. It’s like a coup d’etat,
except lamer.
I honestly have no idea what you do
eachandeveryday.Icanonlystalk,say1
people at a time so unless you’re Rachel
d’Engel, I have no idea what you’re do-
ing now, what you did yesterday or what
you’re going to do tomorrow.
I can only imagine therefore that
your activities fall into three categories.
(a) Things that are expensive to do
and therefore I do them because I’m a
douchebag with too much money who
lived in Beit in my 1st year.
(b) Things that restrict physical
contact with other human beings and
therefore I do them because I’ve been
psychologically damaged by my par-
ents insistence on academic success
(c) Things that I read about in Vice
magazine or some other pretentious
‘culture’ magazine that essentially dic-
tates to people who think that they ‘go
against the crowd’ and therefore I do
them because I have a crippling need
to appear cool around art students.
Hangman falls into none of these
categories, mostly because we’re a
fucking silhouette on the pages of a
student newspaper and therefore don’t
do anything (one of the benefits of be-
ing a silhouette is that you have no idea
where I’m looking right now...)
However, we do have a pretty good
idea why Imperial students fall into
these three frankly repulsive catego-
ries; arrogance.
People in the first group believe that
they are infinitely more good-looking,
better dressed and ‘better’ than every-
one else, a mental defect that comes
from the arrogance that a life of con-
stant pampering has cultivated.
‘People’ in the second group have
decided that the real world isn’t good
enough for them, the wonder of crea-
tion is apparently secondary to the
World of Warcraft. They are arrogant
enough to waste their short time on
this Earth in a role-playing game be-
cause they are unable to play any other
role in society
Oh and finally those meatflaps who
bitch and moan about how lame is Im-
perial. University is what you make it,
these people are arrogant enough to
believe that it’s not their fault that they
have a shit life.
The best people at Imperial have a
little humility, luckily there are some.
Lawrence Weetman has a bloody
dodgy tache. God help Live! next year.
