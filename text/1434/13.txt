The Taste of
Home? Your mum
A
s many of you reading this
will appreciate, I have be-
come a little bit obsessed
with a certain food pro-
gramme on iPlayer. Great
British Menu has really captivated my
imagination, excited my palate and ru-
ined an hour of my dissertation work
every evening in the past few weeks. The
competition aims to find 4 dishes that
represent a Taste of Home that will be
cooked in a banquet for troops coming
home from Afghanistan. Some of the
best chefs in the country have offered up
their ‘Taste of Home’ with the obligatory
gastronomic twist. Quotation marks fly
across the menus like they are going out
of fashion. What is the difference be-
tween ‘chicken’ and chicken, anyway? Is
it the thought of chicken on a plate, or
the scent of a chicken wafted across the
dish? Or is a carrot called Chicken, by
some strange interspecial twist?
Anyhoo, the chefs’ offerings included
[Dover Sole] Fish Fingers with Mushy
Peas, [Duck] Pie with [Duck] Scratch-
ings, Corned Beef with ‘HP’ sauce and
Lancashire Hotpot with pickled Cab-
bage. There is obviously a lot of regional
rivalry here which makes the competi-
tion even more enjoyable. It also brings
a lot of fond, nostalgic memories to
mind. Despite being a Northerner by
association, most of my memorable culi-
nary memories reside in the south. They
include Fish Fingers with lemon juice
accompanied by Sesame Street and Sar-
dines on hot, buttery toast with a side of
SuperTed.
Obviously the chefs competing have
put a lot of thought, imagination and
top-quality ingredients into what they
think is a ‘Taste of Home’. I would re-

Best bits: Venue, ingredients
Worst bits: Lack of imagination,
high prices
Serves 4
25g butter
4 chicken breasts, diced (or Quorn works very well, too)
1 onion, finely chopped
1 red chilli, finely chopped
400 mL coconut milk (tin or from powder)
300 mL chicken stock
Several of handfuls of vegetables (e.g. okra or spinach)
Salt and Pepper
Cook the chicken in the butter for 5 minutes. Add the onion and chilli
to the pan. Cook for 4 minutes, or until the onions are soft. Add the
coconut milk and chicken stock. Bring to the boil and simmer for 10
minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. Stir in your cho-
sen vegetables. Cook for 5 minutes then season appropriately. If the
sauce is still quite liquid, reduce it by cooking with the lid off. Serve
with noodles or rice.

ally like to find out what your Taste of
Home is, be it tea and biscuits or Spam.
Send me a short email (food.felix@impe-
rial.ac.uk) with your name, year of study,
course and what your Taste of Home is,
and why?
Before I run out of steam, let me add
my mini fortnightly compendium of
quick recipes for you to try. This week,
I thought beans would be a good idea.
Tinned beans are so versatile and super-
cheap. They form the basis of many
summer salads, dips and soups. Here are
a few quick cook ones for your belly:
1. Broad bean and feta salad. Drain
and rinse a tin of broad beans. In a bowl,
mash up ½ a packet of feta cheese and
stir in the beans. Add a dash of olive oil
then scoop into pitta breads for a tasty
lunch.
2. Lentil Salad. Chop 1 onion, 1 red
pepper and a few lardons of bacon (op-
tional). Cook in a little oil until softened
then add a drained tin of green lentils.
Stir for a couple of minutes then season
and add a dash of olive oil. Serve with
grilled meats or hard boiled eggs.
3. Bean Spead. Take a tin of your fa-
vourite beans (cannellini beans work
well). Drain and rinse the beans then
mush them in a bowl with a dash of ol-
ive oil. Add a handful of fresh parsley
and a squeeze of lemon juice. Serve on
hot, buttered toast or as an alternative to
mayo in sandwiches.
I hope you enjoy the rest of the food
page this week. David Stewart lays into
overprices British Grub at the Over-
priced Borough Market and I’ve given
you (another) dish to try out. In the
meantime, good luck in your exams and
don’t forget to send any nostalgic food
memories my way. Ta, duck!
T
here isn’t a single week
that goes past without
some uninspiring jour-
nalism about how British
cuisine is doomed/mis-
understood/world-beating. Perhaps
my feeling about the restaurant Roast
typifies my view.
One can’t help but notice a revival
of classic dishes from around the UK
(Yorkshire puddings, Lancashire Hot-
pot, Treacle Tart, and so forth) and
help but think that preserving tradi-
tions (even bad ones) has great merit
and makes the world a better place. So
I am all in favour of such a revival but
where there is a genuine movement
for something - a fashion, if you will -
there are also hangers-on.
These are people who find out which
way a trend is heading and copy it
without adding anything substantial.
Roast is to the British Food Revival
what Top Shop is to Couture. Except
it’s worse than that. Top Shop at least
creates affordable versions of the lat-
est thing than almost anyone can buy.
Roast produces mediocre versions of
what people should be cooking in their
own homes and charges the prices
that only the well-off can afford. Roast
shows us in fact, just how far we have
yet to come as a nation and shows us
that the population need to learn how
to cook.
I don’t want to dwell on the absurdly
boring food for too long but it is neces-
sary to prove my thesis that I mention
some of it. Perhaps the food is exem-
plified by Dorset crab cake with fried
squid, chilli and soured cream (£15.00)
where a few flakes of crab are drowned
in mashed potato and covered in na-
cho dressing. Or perhaps it’s exempli-
fied by English calf’s liver with mar-
row fat peas and smoked ham hock
(£19.00) which fails even in conception
to work .
How does such a place succeed then?
It is admittedly a nice venue. It is ad-
mittedly sourcing fantastic ingredients
from downstairs in Borough Market.
But that’s not the real reason. It’s that
people (particularly ones with more
money than sense) can’t cook. This is
the sort of food which should appear
on one’s dining table on a daily basis.
Its easy food; its food your mother
probably cooked for you for Sunday
Lunch. I was flabbergasted to find
out by watching Celebrity Come Dine
With Me that that venomous little
vile, vitriolic prepubescent brat caught
in the body of a bald man seethe-pot
Toby Young, literally hasn’t the faintest
idea even how to roast a fillet of beef
(which he shouldn’t be doing anyway).
So naturally when someone does the
eminently possible and produces some
devilled kidneys on toast some incom-
petent fathead like Young goes wild,
even if charged over a tenner for it.
Roast is really is no better than pay-
ing someone to hand you a towel in the
Gents when you can get the thing per-
fectly bloody well yourself, thank you.
It is as acceptable not to be able to cook
this food as it is not to be able to wipe
your own arse.
Roast gets a roasting
David Stewart lays in to all those copycats out there. Miaow!
Eating a Roast at Roast is just too ironic to behold. Even more ironic is the £20 price tag.

Cummerbunds
They are definitely back baby,
and are also a must to be hon-
est. If you own a proper dinner
shirt, you will know why they
are a must, mainly because
the pattern on the shirt doesn’t
go all the way to the bottom,
so you do need one. Also
don’t get a multi-coloured one,
because that is shit!
Spats
First, a lesson. This can worn
by both sexes although you
should probably leave the
bright ones to the females.
They protect your feet and
ankles from mud, water and
basically any other bit of sew-
age that you might find on the
street.
Cravats
To complete this effective
high-jack of the fashion page,
Хангман brings you the cravat.
A lovely neck-piece worn by
gentlemen of Croatia (that’s
where the word comes from)
is now worn by some of the
most esteemed gentlemen of
the world. Need some proof,
just look at Basil Fawlty, now
he was a true gentleman and
pulled off the cravat with
absolute style. Make sure you
get yours now!

Special thanks to Thomas Edgar for providing original photographs for this week.
A
udrey tautou is added to
the list of glamourous
women - among Audrey
Hepburn and Nicole
Kidman - to speak for
the legendary Chanel No. 5 perfume.
The No.5 “film” - not to be mistaken
as an ordinary “advert” - tells a story of
a brief but sensual encounter between
Tautou and a man on the oriental ex-
press to Istanbul.
The film was directed by Jean-Pierre
T
he RCA is showcasing
their graduates’ crea-
tions on the 10th June.
The world’s only post-
graduate fashion school
is dedicated to
designing a full
range of fashion
gears, from hats
to footwear. To
name a few de-
signer alumni
of the college –
Julien MacDon-
ald, Philip Trea-
cy and Daniel
Kearns (who
now works for
McQueen).
36 postgraduate students will put
their final collections on the catwalk.
There will also be static displays of
footwear and accessory designs.
The brilliant show will take place just
to the back of our union building, in
Jeunet, who collaborated with Tautou
in Amelie.
The film crew spent 4 months
filming in Nice and Istanbul for the
2-minute short film. The budget of the
film was rumoured to be $25 million.
Chanel has named May the fifth as the
“No.5 Day” in New York, and the first
No.5 film was released on Channel 5
in the UK. Surprise surprise, the 2009
version of the film was unveiled on the
Chanel website - on 5th May.
the Henry Moore Gallery at the Royal
College of Art on 10 June 2009.
There are two shows for the day:
a 4pm one and a later one at 7pm.
Each show lasts one and a half hour.
Although usually
nobody has to pay
to attend fashion
shows, the shows
cost £12 and £24
respectively.
The £24 ticket
includes a glass
of complimentary
champagne and
canapé. Consider-
ing most fashion
shows finish in 20
minutes; paying
£12 to see more than 10 collections in
one go is still a bargain.
Book your tickets online at the RCA
website: http://web.rca.ac.uk/world-
