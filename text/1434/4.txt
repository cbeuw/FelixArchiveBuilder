W
hen Diane Abbott
spoke in the Hous-
es of Parliament,
about the mythical
‘apartheid’ in high-
er education and the supposed domi-
nance of white students at Imperial
and the LSE, she failed to address the
core issue by being dramatic instead of
precise.
The use of the term apartheid was
dishonest. An emotive and highly
charged term, apartheid at its simplest
refers to the South African regime
from 1948 to 1994 but when used out
of this historical context it implies a
broad economic, social and political
system of denial and discrimination of
people of a certain ethnic group. This
is not the case at Imperial or the LSE,
or for that matter any higher academic
institution in the UK. Indeed cou-
pled with her assertion that there is a
dominance of white students at Impe-
rial and the LSE, one wonders if Ms.
Abbott knows anything about Higher
Education in the UK.
Letters to and from the Editor
Dear Felix,
I was alarmed at an email I received
from the Humanities department
warning that Imperial College would
be cutting its language provision in
2010. Higher- level language courses
and beginners’ classes in languages
such as Japanese and Italian would be
no longer taught.
I am currently a third year Erasmus
students studying in France and I have
benefitted greatly from the wonder-
ful teaching and support from the
Imperial humanities department. Not
only did I come to France with ample
knowledge of the language to succeed
in everyday life, I had a good base on
which to build my vocabulary and
improve my grammar. Studying a lan-
guage is a very enriching subject and I
think that it is important for students
to still have the opportunity to learn
languages as part of their degree.
Whilst studying in France I have met
many students from different Euro-
pean countries who have had not only
free but compulsory language lessons
as part of their degree. Of course it is
important to learn English as it is the
language of science but many students
I knew spoke another European lan-
guage, other than English, that was not

We are ever vigilant
about fluent
speakers
Dear Sir
On page three in the last issue (1,433),
one of your students interviewed about
the cuts said that ‘people in language
courses are more fluent than they let
on’. This accusation is one that we take
very seriously. The entry levels are
clearly given; see the website.

All language staff are aware of this
problem and are vigilant. Out of 1,350
students who take languages, very few
try to cheat. This year for example, one
such was identified and barred from
the Humanities programme.
We would not like the impression to
be given that language classes are not
run professionally.

Dear Diane Abbott,
I am writing in response to the comments you made on the 20th May during
the Westminster Hall debate on the London Metropolitan University.
I am bitterly disappointed by your use of the word apartheid in describing the
ethnic composition of Imperial College, as the word is entirely inappropriate.
Apartheid implies institutionalized segregation and racism, and its use in this
context for the sake of rhetoric cheapens its historical significance.
Furthermore, both Imperial College and the London School of Economics pride
themelves on their international reputation and their strong multicultural and
multi-ethnic communities.
I invite you to come to our South Kensington campus to witness first hand how
diverse Imperial College really is.
Kind Regards

Erasmus needs the
laguages
Dear Editor,
I am writing on behalf of the Imperial
College Erasmus Club, but also on a
personal level, to register our strongest
possible opposition to the proposed
cuts to the languages programme for
the coming years. Like many other
Imperial students, I have person-
ally benefitted tremendously from the
fantastic language tuition offered by
the Humanities programme, both on
a cultural level and as preparation for
the year I spent on exchange in Swit-
zerland. And like hundreds of other
Imperial students, I am immensely
grateful to College for allowing me
the opportunity to have spent a year
abroad, surrounded by a culture, and
people, completely new and different
to those back home. This is an im-
mensely enriching experience which
I would urge anyone considering it to
take; going on exchange was probably
the best decision I’ve ever made and I
know many, many other ex-Erasmus
students would say the same.
So it is with great sadness that I read
the news about these cuts, because I
know this will directly deny that same
opportunity to many more students in
the future, and many more will like-
wise be denied the chance to come to
Imperial in return. This will restrict
the students eligible to go abroad to
only those with prior knowledge of the
host language, and will therefore have
the greatest impact on exchanges to
the less mainstream, and often more
interesting countries. This will make
for a culturally much poorer college.
We at the Erasmus club are com-
pletely mystified as to how a 5% col-
lege-wide budget cut can result in the
decimation of one of the most valuable
parts of the College. Does the College
really care about student satisfaction?
If so, can they not see that for a set
of challenging optional courses to be
massively oversubscribed by students
means that they are extremely highly
valued? Does the College really care
about graduate employability? If so, do
they not realise how valuable even ba-
sic foreign language skills are in the UK
jobs market, where they are so hard to
come by?
I speak not only for the present
members of the Erasmus club, but
above all for our future members, for
prospective students, for those who
will lose out, in urging the College to
reconsider these proposals. We under-
stand cuts must be made, but please,
use some common sense; Languages
are simply too valuable to the College
and to students to be culled in this way.
Yours sincerely,
Christopher Thomas
Erasmus Club President 2008-09
their mother tongue. Languages are a
great benefit and rewarding to study.
It is a great achievement having a con-
versation with somebody in a language
that is not your own.
Languages are important for busi-
ness and science, we must give up this
“why bother everybody speaks English
anyway” attitude. Speaking another
language opens the number of people
you can communicate with and also
makes you very aware of your compe-
tency in your own language.
Please do not let the languages pro-
gramme at Imperial College disap-
pear. My Erasmus year has been very
rewarding and I hope that the oppor-
tunity will remain for people to study
languages for years to come.

Dear Christopher and Laura
Firstly, I am glad that you are keen to
use felix as a means of expressing your
alarm at the imminent humanities
cuts. I hope that you will be glad to
hear that several students have al-
ready complained about the potential
cuts and a demonstration has been
planned for the 3rd June outside the
Faculty Building.
In the meantime, we will try to keep
everyone up-to-date with the latest de-
velopments regarding the humanities
courses.
Hope to see you on the 3rd
Yours Sincerely

There is an important question to
be addressed regarding black students
in higher education, namely “Why is
there a low proportion of black stu-
dents at Russell group universities and
a high proportion of black students at
former polytechnics?” However Ms.
Abbott has cheapened the discus-
sion by being needlessly provocative
and thus (whether wilfully or just out
of carelessness) distracted the debate
from the key point, which is the fail-
ures of the support system available to
black students before they even make
their UCAS applications.
Ultimately, Ms Abbott has done her
constituents and the debate a disserv-
ice. By flagrantly raising the spectre of
racism she makes it more difficult to
have a productive and candid conver-
sation on this issue. And by refusing to
acknowledge that Russell group insti-
tutions like Imperial and the LSE admit
students based only on their academic
achievements, she has achieved noth-
ing of any value, except maybe to gar-
ner some media attention for herself.
Don’t forget to fill out the letter and
return it to us if you think that Diane
Abbott’s comments were inappropriate
