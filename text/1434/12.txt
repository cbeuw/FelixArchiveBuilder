Eye candy of Morocco
Where on Earth is the Moroccan paradise for innovation,
alternative lifestyle, shopping, and the demanding palate?
Dylan Lowe has found the answer in suave Essaouira
E
ver find yourself wonder-
ing the names of places you
have been, and of people
you have met, during your
travels and find them forev-
er lost from memory? I get that. In fact,
it is exactly why I can’t write a much
more intriguing article about a more
exotic holiday location ‒ I simply don’t
remember enough.
I did think it is about time I start
keeping a travel journal.
But is it actually necessary? There are
better ways to maintain memoirs of my
adventures, other than scribbling like a
recluse whilst all the action is happen-
ing. Photography, for instance. Clichéd
may it sound, isn’t a picture worth a
thousand words? Or through conver-
sations with my travel companions?
After all, memory are locked away and
easily divulged through reminiscence.
And truth to be told, bluntly, I simply
can’t be arsed. No more than three en-
tries later, unmotivated by my lack of
progress, I gave up writing.
As I now sit behind my desk, glar-
ing into the computer screen with the
greatest writers’ block known to man-
kind, I have begun regretting it.
The photographs are of little help.
They might have successfully captured
a millisecond of the prized moment,
they still fail to depict what goes on
during the minutes of separation be-
tween each shot. Further, there is sim-
ply no way to convey the status of my
mentality, my emotion, or anything
brewing in the subconscious level.
While imprints of those absorbed by
my senses may remain lodged some-
where in my head, I am afraid the feel-
ings related to these observations may
be lost forever.
And that it isn’t practical to ring up
my travel companions every time I
stumble across a hotel, a person, or an
item whose name I can’t recall.
What I do recall are instants where
I sat through bus journeys or waits
for trains, idly spent musing in a John
Dorian fashion. These valuable hours
could have been put to better uses, like
writing an entry in the journal.
It would have been a good time not
only to record past events for recol-
lection. The tranquillity provides the
perfect opportunity to reflect on my
encounters, think beneath the surface,
and put my thoughts into ink before it
vanishes indefinitely.
Besides, I have to have some kind of
pastime, especially when I finally get
bored of whichever novel I happen to
be reading.
There is, however, a rub: what if I
lose my journal? What if I am to go
rafting at three in the morning, in a
drunken spree, and accidentally drop
my journal into the frozen waters be-
neath? Will I be able to bear the loss,
seeing it drift along the current, letters
dissolve and fade into nothing?
In fact, I know someone who did ex-
actly that.
Simple. Just as you would back up
your photographs along your trav-
els, reserve a spare copy of the travel
journals.
Without hassling the photocopi-
ers, the obvious method is to type up
the entries and save it digitally. Better
still, start a blog ‒ when your family
and friends are waiting impatiently for
the latest tales of your adventures, you
wouldn’t want to disappoint them.
But then, by the end of the day, with
all of the excitement and anticipation
occupying your precious time, is it
worth the trouble?
At least make an effort. For your
own sake, you will not regret it in a few
year’s time when your memory decides
to fail you.
And trust me, you wouldn’t want to
be in my position right now.

Travel journal:
to keep or not
to keep
M
ind you, the place
isn’t what we Brits
would define as a
seaside resort.
First up, Essaouira
doesn’t have a beach littered with chip-
ies, English-speaking beer-serving
bartenders, and nude sunbathers’ foul-
mouthed disputes over sun beds. The
waves, chopped up by the mighty At-
lantic Ocean, extinguished any hopes
for a casual swim (but made it an ideal
spot for windsurfers). Gusty breezes
made the sea shores an unsuitable
venue for anything more than an after-
noon stroll.
It didn’t stop us, however, from
abandoning the majestic ‒ and overly-
touristy ‒ splendours of Marrakesh for
a coach bound for this ‘off-beaten’ city.
There would be, as we perched on our
terrace before the foamy ripples hours
later, no regrets.
“Looking for riad? I show you riad.”
There were several peculiarities in
“women
neglecting their
household roles
to engage in
‘masculine’ work
is a violation of
social conduct”
scenes of this sort. Finding a Moroc-
can, whom I suppose you can define
as a faux guide or tout, approaching
a pair of backpackers fresh off the bus
and ‘assisting’ their search for a riad,
was not one of them. The individual
concerned complaining afterwards
about too small a tip wasn’t either.
What was unusual as the fact that
our Moroccan ‒ and escort who saved
us the trouble of getting lost ‒ hap-
pened to be female.
In this ultra-macho Muslim state,
where the lads and lasses remain in
accepted segregation prior to mar-
riage, for women neglecting their tra-
ditional household roles to engage in
‘masculine’ work is a violation of social
conduct. While sexism is encouraged,
dishonouring it could get you much
more than just regular scorn in the
neighbourhood.
Apparently not in Essaouira.
Just as the name makes a fine tongue
twisters challenge (pronounced es-
soo-WE-rah), its inaccessibility (un-
reachable by plane or train, no vehi-
cles permitted within Medina) meant
Essaouira is reserved exclusively for
those who take their travelling a bit
more seriously, not to the blasé week-
enders. But it is changing. The city has
long been the eye candy of Morocco,
with its authentic 18th century Medi-
na named a UNESCO World Heritage
Site in 2001.
So where the Western liberals have
descended upon in their holiday mak-
ing, it was bad news for the Moroccan
men and their cultural integrity. Not so
much for the women, who have finally
cast away their crockery for the better
career prospects.
It didn’t matter how many defini-
tions of a riad you have read: a glimpse
at the real thing would solve all mys-
teries. My Lonely Planet might call it “a
traditional house set around a garden
courtyard, restored and established as
guesthouses”. After hauling ourselves
and the rucksacks across one maze of
a Medina, we found our accommoda-
tion shoved into a rugged back alley.
Instead of opening up a Pandora’s Box
of interior design disasters, we dis-
covered the rose petal- clad fountain
glazed in sunlight from the atrium, the
colour-coded tiles daubed beneath our
footsteps towards reception. Three
flights up later, we erased any remain-
ing reservations and called the riad our
new home.
The view was persuasive enough
‒ where better to recline in utter re-
laxation than facing the very ramparts
Orlando Bloom scuttled across whilst
repelling Saracens in Kingdom of Heav-
en, and overlooking the very streets
where Orson Welles filmed his adap-
tation of Othello some fifty years ago?
The city’s artistic links don’t end
with the movie industry ‒ it had more
to do with the talent of individual
Essaouirans.
A short walk away from the hotel re-
vealed just how high the standards of
innovation Essaouira delivers. Beside
merchants selling paintings of im-
mense quality, I spotted a shop exhib-
iting statues composed of welded junk.
The unseen genius, whom I recognised
in a glance, had locked himself in his
workshop, away from the storefront,
where his affair with imagination
flared alongside the forge.
And let’s not forget that Essaouira
hosts the Gnaoua and World Music
Festival annually.
“Essaouira
is reserved
exclusively for
those who take
their travelling
a bit more
seriously”
Another art form Essaouirans
seemed to have perfected was hos-
pitality. We were jostled around like
sacks of gold in the frigid markets of
Marrakesh, where customers are cus-
tomers and customers only; shopkeep-
ers in Essaouira may feel the urge to dig
into our wallets, they would still treat
us with the dignity we deserve.
There was this one occasion where
Anna had fallen ill with some sort of
stomach discomfort: whilst shopping
for ceramics she asked for a chair to
sit on, as the pain became unbearable.
Our salesman happily obliged, before
rushing off and returning with glasses
of gingered spice tea. The owner of
Café Salma, a favourite spot of ours,
gave Anna a delicate wooden sculp-
ture of a camel upon hearing it was her
birthday.
Speaking of food, I had hardly a mo-
ment where I went about Essaouira
empty-stomached. This place may well
be the living incarnation of any gastro-
nome’s dream. We were never too far
from a restaurant that served tajines
at affordable prices; just as we licked
our fingers (quite literally as Moroc-
cans eat with their hands) and contem-
plate an unsavoury treat, the patisserie
was always around the corner. Came
nightfall and the kebab places livened
with aromas luring patrons to their
doorsteps, but if the hunger couldn’t
wait that long there were chickpeas,
giant doughnuts and crêpes in ready
supplies.
Failing to mention its seafood would
be unjust to the city ‒ all of the coun-
try’s maritime resources originate
from the Atlantic coast where Es-
saouira is located. A quick visit to the
fish souk, a semi-open square where all
fishy matters of trade are dealt, would
shake your apparent knowledge of ma-
rine biology to the core. We took the
time to make a few purchases, brought
it to the fish grills nearby: it made a
perfect luncheon as our seafood came
back chargrilled, served with bread
and salad, all for a mere Dh 25 (£2).
Essaouira is where the customs of the
Arabic world and Western influence
coexist in perfect equilibrium. Even so,
this beautiful balance is threatened by
the increasing conversion of the city
into yet another tourist hotspot, and
the misinterpretation of Moroccan
youths on our values.
It is a sad thought; but at least I had
the privilege to appreciate it at its
prime before the floods of tourist over-
flows the Medina.
