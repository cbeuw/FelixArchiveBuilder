How to avoid a mess like Brexit: let’s adopt
a new voting system

Here is a modest proposal that could help to solve the issue.
POLITICS
Divyen
Since the Brexit
referendum we’ve seen
Brexit come to dominate
British politics. It has
been incredibly divisive
and has created more
problems than it has
solved. It has sent both
of the major political
parties into turmoil. We
need to ask ourselves
how we got here and
more importantly how
can we avoid this kind
of anarchy in future.
The fundamental
problem of Brexit is
that there is a clear
disconnect between the
Members of Parliament
who are meant to rep-
resent us, and the will
of the people. The vast
majority of MPs are
natural remainers and
yet the public voted
to leave the EU. This
represents an obvious
flaw in the system and
David Cameron tried to
fix this by way of a ref-
erendum. This evidently
hasn’t worked and one
of the reasons why is
because the UK system
isn’t geared towards
referendums. Referen-
dums introduce another
mandate which can and
will come into conflict
with the mandate that
MPs gain when they are
elected to the Commons.
This can be seen now
as remainers in the
Commons are being
forced to enact some-
thing they see as fun-
damentally wrong and
damaging to the country.
This is a complete
anathema under a Par-
liamentary system and
will ultimately lead to
an outcome that nobody
will be particularly
happy with. For this
reason, it’s best to avoid
referendums and leave it
to those who we elect to
make decisions on our
behalf which is precise-
ly their job.
There must be another
way to avoid this kind
of problem arising in
the first place. The
simplest solution would
be to make sure there is
a far better correlation
between the views that
are held by the general
public and the views
that are held within
Parliament. This is ob-
viously the best way for
a democracy to function.
However, under the
current UK system
this currently doesn’t
happen.
The system used at
the moment is first past
the post (FPTP) where
the country is split into
tiny constituencies and
each constituency elects
one person to represent
them in Parliament.
This has some benefits
such as ensuring a local
constituency link so that
local problems can be
raised and dealt with
at a national level. The
system also increases
the chances of a single
party gaining a majority
due to a landslide effect
which in turn should
allow for the formation
of a strong and stable
government, as Theresa
May would say. The
landslide effect means
that the larger parties get
a dividend for getting a
higher percentage of the
national vote. A simple
thought experiment
demonstrates this; if
every constituency voted
51% for party A and 49%
for party B then their
national shares would
be 51% and 49% respec-
tively. However, party A
would win 100% of the
seats and B none. Whilst
exaggerated this demon-
strates the fundamental
problem that parties
that have a large share
of the vote will win in a
higher number of seats
at a local level and this
can be seen in the 2015
election where the SNP
got just over 50% of the
vote in Scotland and yet
took 56/59 seats. This is
clearly entirely undem-
ocratic and a poor way
of running a country. It
also means that minor
parties such as the Lib
Dems, the Greens and
UKIP get far fewer seats
than they deserve. Even
if one doesn’t agree with
their politics they still
deserve fair representa-
tion.
It is now time to re-
consider voting reform.
There are several
models that would lead
to far more satisfactory
outcomes. One of these
is the single transferra-
ble vote (STV) system.
This system works by
electing multiple repre-
sentatives to represent
one area. On the ballot
you list the candidates in
your order of preference
and then candidates
that get above a set
threshold (i.e. a fifth of
the vote if 5 candidates
are to be elected) and
any additional votes are
transferred to second
preferences. If at any
point no more candidates
have crossed the thresh-
old the candidate with
the lowest vote share is
removed and their votes
are redistributed based
on next preference.
This system has some
key advantages. It will
lead to a far more pro-
portional representation
of the popular vote and
maintain the constit-
uency link. Further,
if you believe one of
your MP is not doing a
good job of representing
your interests then there
are other local MPs
who should represent
you. STV would be far
better at dealing with an
issue like Brexit which
has caused internal
“Brexit
has been
incredibly
divisive and
has created
more problems
than it has
solved”
divisions within both
parties. Parties are able
to stand multiple candi-
dates in one area under
STV; therefore, they
could stand a leaver and
a remainer and leave it
to the public to decide
which candidate/opinion
they prefer leading to a
far better representation
of people’s views in
Parliament.
Brexit has been an
issue which has divided
both parties for decades
and it is time that we
introduced a system
that can cope with it.
The public have a right
to have their voices
heard and referendums
clearly don’t work
either. The time has
come to abandon FPTP
and to bring in STV as
our voting system for
general elections.
