We are all individuals: The Turner Prize 2018
The Turner Prize is awarded to a British artist for an outstanding exhibition in the preceding year. This year the
shortlist features four films, each tackling pressing issues in society today. Arts Writer Calum Drysdale gives his
take on the shortlistees for one of the world’s best known awards for visual arts.
A
friend and I had
a conversation
recently about
whether there
was something fundamen-
tal to non-conforming (he
is into that sort of thing).
“By going outside of what
is socially acceptable one
defies. That act of inde-
pendence and definition
of oneself not by others’
standards but by one’s
own is the greatest sign of
self-liberation possible.”
“Sure, I get all that,
but don’t you all just roll
your jeans up and wear
non-functional shoes?”
Reading up about what
was on at the Turner prize
before going did give me
a certain sense of valida-
tion. All four of the short-
listed artists are exhibiting
films, certainly enough
to drive the annual Daily
Mail think pieces asking
‘Is this really art? Really?’
into overdrive. How dif-
ferent, I asked myself, can
you possibly be if you all
insist on being different
together?
Getting to the right
gallery requires further
hiking than expected,
through ambiguously
sized rooms that all
squeeze in one and a half
identical acrylic and steel
sculptures intended to
confound any sense of
direction or taste.
A large, square and
wonderfully sound-in-
sulated room greets you
as you come through the
doors. On the walls are
panels providing brief
descriptions of each of
the films and wonder-
fully suggestive open
doorways that lead off
into the darkness. It feels
like quibbling but I would
recommend reading up
before going as the panels
are rather heavy on niche
film and technical jargon
and proportionally light
on content, but it is a
miser’s complaint.
The films themselves
certainly showed me the
error of my ways. The
prize, given each year, is
intended to recognise and
celebrate art produced
or first exhibited the
year before. This is art
as contemporary as it is
possible to be and, with
a few notable exceptions,
it bursts with life and
ambition.
“This is art as
contemporary
as it is possible
to be... it
bursts with life
and ambition”
“Like a thriller,
it jumps
between light
and dark,
action and
silence”
The Charlotte Rogers
film is a bizarre mas-
terpiece of mashed
together footage, but it
avoids sinking into kitsch
through the relentless
humanity that powers it
throughout. The audience
is welcomed in to Char-
lotte’s life and can often
see exactly what Charlotte
xeself saw through xe’s
use of small handheld
cameras that allow a quiet
to permeate the film, even
over the amazing sound
track. The long non-mov-
ing shots work to draw in
the audience and, rather
than growing dull (some
go on for 10 minutes),
they pulsate with tension
and danger. Add to this
the piece’s tying together
of the ancient Yatesesque
magic and myth of Aber-
deenshire Scotland with
modern gender-question-
ing identity and this is a
film that makes worth the
whole trip worthwhile.
Luke Willis Thompson
takes a different approach
in his submission. He very
closely examines five
separate lives and takes
this magnifying glass
approach to extremes,
investigating human
bodies – with an emphasis
on people of colour
and their historical and
current reality. In his most
surreal piece he moves the
camera around and inside
a house-like sculpture
made of human skin and
dressmaker’s pins. The
sculpture exists as an
independent piece of art –
My Mother. My Father. My
Sister. My Brother 1996-7
(The Estate of Donald G.
Rodney, London) – and is
made of the skin removed
by surgeons during
Rodney’s treatment for
sickle cell anaemia.
Uncomfortable is not
a strong enough word
to describe the feelings
evoked. As the film goes
on, the house begins to
resemble a body itself,
steel bones holding up
an incredibly tiny and
fragile creation. Where he
overreaches is his portrait
of Diamond Reynolds,
the girlfriend of Philando
Castile, shot at a traffic
stop in 2016. The film is
meant as an accompany-
ing piece to her Facebook
Live video shot in the af-
termath of her boyfriend’s
killing, but it feels cheap
and profiteering.
Forensic architecture’s
The Long Duration of a
Split Second has the most
immediate and visceral
appeal of the four films.
Like a thriller, it jumps
between light and dark,
action and silence, and
unlike the other three the
content feels necessary
and even vital. The real
world, normally very
far away in those dark
showing rooms, rushes in
and cannot be denied.
The film tells the story
of the killing of a villager
in Umm al-Hiran, a
Bedouin community in
the Negev/Naqab desert
which the Israeli army
was attempting to destroy.
This is modern activism
with baubles on.
Finally, there is Naeem
Mohaiemen. His two
films had, if truth be told,
an incredible soporific
effect on me. Watching an
immaculately linen-suited
man smoke cigarettes in
an abandoned airport,
cradling dressmakers’
manikins – it felt like there
was meaning floating
around somewhere, but
it was too amorphous to
grasp. The second one, an
ode to Asian socialism,
affected me even less.
Wonderfully filmed vistas
are not enough to justify
radical and extreme
change.
The Turner Prize,
smarmy as ever but
maybe, just maybe, a
good day out.

Find love, be happy: The Distance You Have Come
W
hen the
r e v i e w e r
writes, he
must re-
member that many, if not
all, of the people that read
his words will not actually
get to see it themselves.
He has incredible power
to influence how a play is
perceived and received.
He must remember that
his own perspective is
subjective and that his
prejudices are his own
and must not be allowed
to impact the review.
Let’s start with what
The Distance You Have
Come is. It is a ‘song
cycle’ – yeah, me neither
– a play done purely
in song. The ‘story’ is
about six people who do
love in various ways. In
The Distance You Have
Come there are plenty of
positive moments. The
singing was pretty good,
important as the whole
‘song cycle’ is done ‘Les
Miz’ style, though the
music system sometimes
failed to keep up with the
actors’ gusto.
The theatre was close
and intimate, the stage
round and simple. The
props, a bench and a
swing, were often well
used, though there is a
limit to how many times
one can stand up on a
swing and it still be en-
dearing. There are funny
parts and Jodie Jacobs as
Anna was exceptional,
funny and endearing.
I can’t decide whether
to include in this list the
fact that LG and B is
represented in a touching
and non-tokenistic way.
Should we cheer when
writers do what is right
and proper? I include it
as important and relevant
and in recognition of the
world we live in.
references (‘Once upon
a time’, ‘I’m a Star’ and
‘Magic’ to name the first
three). This makes the
cast feel petulant and
immature. These are
grown adults making poor
life decisions and singing
about going to Neverland.
The first half continues
in this way, lurching
between the sugar sweet
happiness of Brian and
Samuel as the post-racial,
post-hetero power couple
and the unfulfilled misery
of the rest of the cast.
What is the point being
made here? The two
lesbians sing about one
of them walking out and
leaving only a note. They
still look pretty happy in
comparison to the other
woman, who, failing au-
ditions left and right, has
pulled a disappearing act,
and the remaining bloke
who takes his clothes off
to reveal an incredible
body in a lovely set piece
involving generic hooded
figures. Depression never
looked this good and we
retire for the interval and
drinks.
This is a trendy place
so date and I get a tumbler
of red on the house. This
is why one becomes an
art critic; opportunities
for accepting bribery
abound. Potentially aided
by the wine or loose
journalistic morals, the
second half begins strong.
The show tunes feel more
appropriate to the second
half spirit of ‘it’ll all be
alright in the end’ and the
cast actually feel united in
recovery, Brianuel having
fallen into some easily
resolvable strife. Drunk
gets picked up and dunked
in the magic cure-all
bench whose seat lifts up
to reveal a trough of all
things. Quick wipe of the
magic sponge and clothes
back on and he is ready
for a meeting with his ex,
who lo and behold is the
woman who magically/
conveniently gets her
Broadway part.
Love is amazingly
revealed to be the cure to
everything as Samurian
cop themselves a baby and
Anna the “stereotypical
lesbian in recovery” meets
“stereotypical alcoholic
in recovery”. She looks at
his arse and, get this, the
female jogger’s and your
heart melts a little bit as
they go for a walk. Top
the whole thing off with
yet another anthem called
‘The Distance You Have
Come” to tell us all to
keep going, find love and
be happy. Love Actually
and Shrek come together
in the end and we never
saw it coming.
This could be some-
one’s cup of tea. The cast
is star spangled and the
music bounces along.
Some of the songs are
finger tappingly good
(though I can’t remember
any of the lyrics) and the
actors are all very cute.
The Cockpit Theatre is
close in Marylebone, and
if the mood took you this
could be a very fun night
out. Go if you want to, go
if you don’t.
Depression, alcoholism, and fairytale romance: all this and more told through the medium of song in a star-
spangled production of The Distance You Have Come at the Cockpit Theatre.

“This is why
one becomes
an art critic...”
This leaves what is
less successful about the
performance. The whole
play comes across as a
mix of Into the Woods
and Bridget Jones’ Baby
and the hybrid is less than
successful. The whole
thing opens with a series
of characters expressing
general discontent with
their lives in trans-At-
lantic show-tune style
anthems that seem at
odds with the search for
a partner, descent into
alcoholism and a long-
term relationship breaking
down.
What is more, these
early songs all feature a
superfluity of fairy tale
