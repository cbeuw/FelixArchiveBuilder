Cycling reach new heights at BUCS Hill Climb
SPORTS
Miscellaneous
Imperial Cycling Club
T
he bikes had been
stripped; bottle
cages removed,
handlebar tape
gone, batteries only half
charged, and we’d been
surviving off sparkling
water and lettuce for
the last three days. The
universal sign of an up-
coming hill climb.
The BUCS Hill Climb,
held this year on the
infamous Mam Tor in the
Peak District, marked the
end of the road season for
the cycling club. People
often question whether it
is worth driving 4 hours
each way for a 6-minute
race and, to be honest,
so we were as we set
off at 7am. A journey
made worse by the fact
we couldn’t eat (some
dubious physics from
Marcus suggested 100g
in weight cost 1s on the
climb).
Morale was low and the
signs for Woburn Safari
Park were tempting but it
only opened at 10am so
we pressed on. Finally the
climb crept into view and
the mood was summed up
by Jack who said, “That
looks quite big”. We
thought this would be a
good time to start getting
the excuses in and moaned
about how Sheffield
University had an unfair
advantage having this on
their doorstep while we
have Exhibition Road.
We went for a quick
recce of the climb which
didn’t tell us much we
didn’t already know from
some extensive street-
view-based research the
night before. There was
a 18% ramp straight out
of the start gate, with the
gradient easing off (by
easing off we’re talking
single-figure gradient)
with the gradient kicking
to 12% again for a brutal
mid-section before a
couple of hairpins into the
finish. Overall stats were
2.2km at 10% (think Box
Hill but twice as steep) –
in essence it starts hard
and gets harder.
We headed back to the
minibus and talked very
loudly about tactics and
power numbers to give off
a vibe that we knew what
we were doing.
Roy Miles was the
first rider off for Imperial
setting a very quick early
time of 7:51, next was
Julian who clocked 10:35,
then Zach at 10:02. Alex
was next off stopping
the clock at 8:32; at 6’3
Alex was always fighting
a losing battle against
gravity but averaged
a huge 380W up the
climb – definitely one to
watch in the time trials.
Jack Hagger, who had an
incredibly detailed pow-
er-based pacing strategy,
was understandably
gutted to see his power
meter decide to re-cali-
brate itself on the start line
though he still managed
to clock an incredibly
impressive 7:26.
There had been a huge
amount of competition
between Imperial’s final
three riders (Alan Slatter,
John Shroff and Marcus
Halson) - beginning on
the recent training camp
to Girona. With one win
apiece in their previous
three hill climbs this was
very much the decider
as the last race of the
season, and their last hill
climb for ICCC. Form
was looking good with
all three clocking Box
Hill PB’s (the universally
accepted form indicator)
in the week leading up to
the event.
Marcus was first off
and, despite making
it abundantly clear to
anyone he spoke to that
this “wasn’t his sort of
hill”, clocked a 7:31. Alan
Slatter was next and on
the legendary pink bike
could be spotted a long
way off. Worryingly for
Marcus he seemed to be
going quite well and he
crossed the line in 7:13 –
a standout performance.
John was last off for
Imperial and, after a solid
ride in the hill climb last
year, was amongst the
big-hitters at the business
end of the event. Aided
by some huge cheers from
the rest of the team he also
stopped the clock in 7:31
(later confirmed to be an
all-important 0.3s behind
Marcus).
The standard of the
event is always very
high, and this year
was no exception. The
winning time of 6:12 at
an astonishing average
speed on 18.7km/h was a
new course record on a
climb that has previously
been used for the national
championships.
Post-race comprised a
lot of calories and excuses
and in the manner of Liv-
erpool fans we all agreed
that next year would be
our year. Morale was
buoyed slightly by seeing
that a UCL rider had
come last. We went over
to offer our condolences
and ended up getting
roped into taking one of
their riders back after
they’d forgotten to book
transport for the return
leg. The invoice is on the
way to UCL as we speak.
It’s been an incredibly
successful year for the
club. There have been ups,
such as Matt Langworthy
winning the BUCS 10
mile TT, and downs such
as missing out on the
glory, and more impor-
tantly the £160 each, of
winning the Catford and
Bec Team prize by the
merest of margins but
we’ll be heading into the
off season with morale
high ready to push on for
next year.

T
his summer we
set out to Nice,
France, for our
summer tour.
Aiming to experience
clay-court tennis (a sur-
face we never get to play
on in London) we took
this opportunity to spend
some time together after a
successful season.
The excitement to play
on the top-quality clay
courts in Nice was clear as
soon as squad assembled
at around 9am at Liver-
pool Street station. But
that had to wait, the first
stop was the Spoons at
Stansted Airport for a pre-
flight breakfast. Shout-out
to the beloved President
for being late, thankfully
we didn’t miss our flight!
Advice to anyone heading
to Nice, don’t sleep on the
plane unlike most of us -
the landing is spectacular.
With the French sun
showing its might instant-
ly, the team took a bus to
the city centre and walked
down to the hostel. After
some time to relax, Nice
was all up for exploring
but it wasn’t long before
a hungry bunch of tennis
players wanted to devour
some traditional French
food. The night carried
far after dinner - and what
better way to end it than a
dip in the Mediterranean
in the early hours of the
morning.
On Saturday, southern
French sunshine filled the
hostel, and we rose up and
headed to breakfast. This
was followed by a trip to
Nice’s beautiful castle.
The team were doubtful it
“Shout-out to
the beloved
President for
being late,
thankfully we
didn’t miss our
flight!”
“Shout-out
to James
for serving
into Bartu’s
head during
doubles”
would be worth the steep
climb to top of the hill,
but the views proved them
wrong. What followed
was a little promenade
around the gardens, water-
falls and gorgeous views
of the Mediterranean. On
the way back to the hostel,
everyone was delighted to
try Socca, a type of crepe
made from chickpea flour
native to Nice.
As soon as the team
made it to the hostel it
was time to bash some
tennis balls. Flip-flops
were switched for tennis
shoes, rackets were
gathered and heads turned
west towards the Nice
Lawn Tennis Club. The
scorching sunshine did
not stop the fierce tennis
lovers from enjoying two
full hours of clay-court
tennis as everyone got to
hit with each other. Shout
out to James for serving
into Bartu’s head during
doubles. As the whole
squad was on the verge of
a heat stroke by the time
tennis was finished, it was
time to hit the beach once
again.
As the sun set over
the French Riviera, the
clay covered shoes were
dusted off and shirts were
worn. The night continued
as the crew embarked on a
bar crawl around Nice; the
details of which won’t be
discussed to preserve the
dignity of certain (all?)
members.
As we began the final
morning, the sun forced its
rays through the shuttered
windows of the hostel
dorms. No one stirred:
they slumbered on through
the first hours of the day.
As a few of the chaps
started to slowly wake
up, heavy-lidded eyes
were slowly prised open,
and hands gently rubbed
throbbing heads and
roiling stomachs. Others
lay completely still, heads
heavily slumped against
the sides of bins, unwill-
ing to move lest the world
start spinning anew. A soft
stutter escaped from the
lips of one slumping form:
“Totally worth it”.
The group eventually
moved - the tennis courts
were booked for 2pm after
all! On court, movements
started sluggish, weak,
pitiful. But, as the team
recovered, the hits gained
in strength and vigour (if
not precision) and balls
went zooming through
the air in yellow streaks,
filling the air with the
comforting sounds of
rhythmic tennis rallying.
Soon, however, the squad
found themselves tiring:
legs were slogging,
shoulders were slumping,
feet were dragging on the
rich red clay of the French
tennis courts. Needless
to say, the French were
thoroughly impressed by
our grand display!
Following training,
the group went for a last
quick swim in the sea
and sunbathed, clearly
uncomfortable on the
pebble beach but too lazy
to move. The evening
slowly reared its head and
the team finally decided
to wander the city for a
well-deserved last meal in
France. And what better
to enjoy in this country
of exquisite local cuisine
than a pineapple pizza
fresh from the oven (the
man was looked down
upon and sentenced to an
evening of judgmental
looks).
And thus our trip ended
here: the team dashing
through town to grab
their taxis, leaving for
the airport, and bellies
wobbling with their last
meal. They accomplished
their mission and brought
to Nice the best of
Imperial culture: a swirl of
high-performance tennis,
a whole lot of “oui-ouis”
and “Ouhlalaaas”, plenty
of growling stomachs and
parched throats and, most
importantly, a belched
rendition of Country
Roads that undoubtedly
still reverberates through-
out the whole town.
If you enjoy playing
tennis or want to learn
how to play, get in touch
with us through social
media and we’ll be more
than happy to get you
involved in the club - and
see you with us next year
for our upcoming tour!
