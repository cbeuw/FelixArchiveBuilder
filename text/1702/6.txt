n 1170, four English
knights murdered
the archbishop of
Canterbury, Thomas
Beckett, following the
orders of king Henry
II. The assassination of
Beckett had ramifications
that reached continental
Europe, and less than two
years after his death he
was declared a saint by
the Church. Henry had to
publicly repent, and the
murderers were exiled
to the Holy Land. The
worship of St. Thomas of
Canterbury grew strong
among Christians, who
saw him as the poor
victim of a ruthless ruler.
He became a symbol, a
martyr of a bigger cause.
What does this have to
do with Jamal Khashoggi,
a Saudi journalist born
788 years after the murder
of Beckett? To understand
the relationship, we have
to explore the life of a
man that had to endure
throughout his life the
tension of being a critical
voice of the Saudi estab-
lishment while coming
from an elite family
himself. A life that was
cut short in a dark room in
Turkey on October 2nd.
Jamal Khashoggi’s
family was deeply linked
to not only the Saudi
royalty, but to the master
classes of the whole
Middle East. His uncle
was the infamous arms
dealer Adnan Khashoggi,
and among his cousins
one could count Dodi
al-Fayed, the tragical
companion of lady Diana
Spencer. During his uni-
versity years, he joined
the Muslim Brotherhood,
a political and religious
group that defended a
very rigorist interpretation
of Sunni Islam. There he
befriended Osama bin
Laden, and defended him
when the future Al Qaeda
leader went to Afghani-
stan to fight alongside the
Mujahedeen against the
Soviet army.
Later, he moderated
to more liberal positions.
A talented journalist, he
worked with the reform-
ist media of the Saudi
kingdom, taking impor-
tant editorial positions in
diaries such as Al Watan,
where he achieved the post
of editor in chief. He was
however under constant
pressure, as the more
conservative elements
in the Saudi government
were displeased by his
criticism of the extreme
religious policies of the
state. Khashoggi was also
critical of Saudi Arabia’s
action in the Yemen
War, which has led to a
famine that is threatening
the lives of millions of
people. He also opposed
the attempts to isolate
Qatar from other Muslim
nations that the Saudi
government enacted after
the schism between the
two countries in 2016, and
advocated Saudi women’s
rights. Thus, he was
increasingly becoming
a thorn in the House of
Saud’s side, and one of the
biggest foes of the power
behind the throne in the
country, Crown Prince
and Defence Minister
Mohammad bin Salman.
He became a bigger threat
when his international
profile started to rise as he
was hired as columnist by
the Washington Post.
He had become too
dangerous and soon the
trap was set. Khashoggi
intended to marry a
Turkish national, and in
order to do so he had to
obtain a set of documents
from the Saudi consulate
in Istanbul. It is not clear
what happened once he
stepped into the building.
We know he was killed,
because the Saudi state
has admitted it after two
weeks of waffling. It is
strongly suspected that
he was murdered in an
extremely macabre way,
involving tortures and
dismemberment with a
bone saw while he was
alive. He was to become
a warning to other dissi-
dents, a reminder of the
fate faced by those who
don’t toe the line of the
state.
But the action back-
fired. Ironically, by
removing one of the
voices that denounced
the corruption and crimes
of the Saudi government,
the perpetrators have
attracted the attention of
the mainstream Western
media, that had till then
not given much attention
to the foreign policies of
the kingdom. Khashoggi
has become the face of
Saudi oppression, of the
massacres in Yemen, of
the plight that the female
Saudis have to endure
every day.
European governments
have started taking action,
with Germany leading the
way to stop the trading of
weapons to the country.
The involvement of
elements of the Saudi state
has become more and
more clear, as the suspects
of carrying out the as-
sassination have been
identified as members
of Bin Salman’s closest
circle. The evidence was
still denied by Saudi
Arabia, which argued for
two weeks that Khashoggi
had disappeared after
leaving the consulate.
They had the support of
Donald Trump, who has
never hidden his disdain
for the free press and his
cosiness to the House of
Saud. But not even the
backing of the American
government was enough
to hide the truth. Saudi
Arabia admitted that
Kashoggi died, though
according to their version
of the story it was follow-
ing a brawl between him
and the Saudi consul. The
latest line of defence is
blaming the crime on the
“A talented
journalist, he
worked with
the reformist
media of
the Saudi
kingdom.”
Saudi legation, insisting
that the Saudi government
had nothing to do with the
murder.
Is Jamal Kashoggi
a modern day Thomas
Beckett? The killing of
Beckett caused such an
outrage that it forced
the king of England to
issue a public apology. It
provoked universal con-
demnation in medieval
Europe, and the kingdom
was in risk of complete
isolation for a time. Centu-
ries have happened since
then, centuries that have
seen massive advances
in human rights and the
rule of law. While our
governments comply with
the march of progress? Or
instead, will they ignore
the matter in the long
term, proving that they
have lower standards than
the feudal monarchies of
Europe. Time will tell.
Until then, we aspiring
journalists can only mourn
the life and work of a man
that stood against powers
that wanting him gone,
and achieved so in the
most gruesome fashion.
