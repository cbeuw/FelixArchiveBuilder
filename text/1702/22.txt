The real star of the show

of humanity’s relationship with our star, and features several contributions from Imperial College.

ollowing the
launch of the
l o n g - a w a i t e d
Parker Solar
Probe by NASAinAugust,
the focus for many in
the scientific world has
shifted heavenwards,
towards the most undeni-
ably omnipotent giver of
life we know – our Sun.
The Science Museum
celebrates our local star
with a highly interactive
and immersive exhibition
that explores both the
underlying physics of the
Sun, as well as its pro-
found impact on culture
and humanity throughout
history.
After entering through
a giant golden archway,
you are immediately
plunged back in time to
begin a chronological
exploration of mankind’s
relationship with the Sun.
Figurines, pottery, and
trinkets – each golden
piece glistening in the low
light – depict some of our
earliest fascinations with
the Sun, and its likening to
various deities. The dawn
of science comes swiftly,
however, and you’re
suddenly surrounded
by intricate hand-drawn
books of sunspot obser-
vations, and an elegant
replica of Copernicus’
On the Revolutions of
Heavenly Orbs – the
seminal text in the devel-
opment of a heliocentric
model of the solar system.
In the absence of
physical understanding,
one of the major things
that could be learned
from the Sun was a
sense of timekeeping.
This is reflected in the
exhibition via an array
of clocks, ranging from
delicate orreries, through
to the first accurate atomic
clock, built at the UK’s
National Physical Labo-
ratory in 1955. As always
with the Science Museum,
interactive displays take
centre stage, and at this
point we’re treated to a
fun game involving the
use of different kinds of
sundials.
Next up, we view the
Sun from the perspective
of health and medicine.
Sunlight as a treatment for
tuberculosisisaprominent
feature, including some
quaint advertising cam-
paigns promoting beach
holidays, and a rather
horrific looking mirrored
sunbed for children,
designed by John Harvey
Kellogg, of Cornflake
fame. A manmade beach
in neon and chrome offers
viewers brief respite and
the chance to recline while
listening to the sounds of
beaches around the world
through handheld coconut
speakers. The juxtaposi-
tion is frank, however, and
worship turns to warning
upon the realisation of
the dangers associated
with overexposure to
sunlight. Now the posters
promote covering up,
staying indoors, or better
still, buying a range of
protective products. This
culminates in a television
ad from the much-loved
Australian 80s campaign
Slip-Slop-Slap. At the
close of this section, we’re
given the chance to try on
historical sunglasses, from
Inuit wooden goggles to
50s fashion glasses, in a
virtual mirror.
From here we enter
more modern times, with
displays on how the Sun
can be used as an energy
resource, and our attempts
to recreate its power in
nuclear fusion projects
such as JET and ITER. A
stark yellow “sunbeam”
installation punctuates
and illuminates the room,
and there are yet more
hands-on experiences
such as a giant LED screen
where you can watch the
sun rise in a location and
season of your choice, and
a challenge to charge a
giant battery by directing a
beam across the table with
rotating mirrors. From
here we learn about the
Sun’s structure, and its in-
fluence on Earth by virtue
of its powerful magnetic
field. A charming an-
imation tells the story
of astronomer Richard
Carrington and the great
solar flare of 1859 which
caused aurorae so bright
that people were able to
read at the dead of night
without a lamp. The
potential for a large solar
storm to massively disrupt
all technology on Earth is
explained; there’s a game
where you can attempt to
save the planet by spotting
active regions on the Sun
which threaten to erupt,
and a ‘survival kit’ for a
geomagnetic storm. While
the dramatization is fun, it
is perhaps overstated to
the extent of fear-mon-
gering, painting the Sun’s
awesome power as a
deadly threat to life on
Earth. While not untrue,
it is perhaps at odds with
the tone of the rest of the
exhibition.
This segues into a
brief history of space
missions to study the Sun,
including Skylab, Helios
and Ulysses. Perhaps a
personal highlight of the
exhibition was a scale
model of the Solar Orbiter
probe which, upon its
scheduled launch in 2020,
will carry a magnetometer
built here at Imperial all
the way to the Sun. Sitting
far out on the back of the
spacecraft, the instrument
is designed to withstand
temperatures ranging
from 80°C to -140°C. A
prototype sits in a glass
case, beneath a video
interview with instrument
manager and department
of Physics’ very own
Helen O’Brien.
The grand finale is a
cinema room showing
stunning footage from
NASA’s Solar Dynamics
Observatory, where the
Sun can be seen up close
in a variety of wavelengths
– turbulent and eruptive as
its fiery plasma coils ele-
gantly around its complex
network of magnetic field
lines. While quite short
for a relatively steep price,
this is an informative and
enjoyable exhibition that
covers everything about
the Sun from our earliest
understandings to the
cutting edge science of
today.
