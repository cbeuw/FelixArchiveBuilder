Stock Amoral Corpo-
ration is involved the film
dive-bombs in quality.
The non-Venom Eddie
scenes do a good job of
establishing the charac-
ter as grim but good at
heart and the first few
scenes after Eddie and
Venom merge are genu-
inely excellent. He hears
voices and has strange
and disgusting urges he
can’t control leading him
to start questioning his
sanity. During this time
you can see the semi-hor-
ror tone they were clearly
aiming for shine through
and the film comes alive
to such an extent that
you’ll start to forgive
its mistakes up to this
point. Unfortunately after
Venom’s voice develops
he ceases to feel in any
way threatening. He
spends most of his time
making quips to Eddie,
at which point all tension
melts away. Eddie and
Venom’s interactions
aren’t strictly bad – in fact
they’re probably the most
consistently entertaining
element of the film – but
they play in stark contrast
to the film at its best.
Venom is both too long
and too short. Clearly
content was added at
the studio’s request and
there wasn’t time left
for all the content the
director wanted. The
film is 2 hours and 40
minute and everything
with Stock Amoral Cor-
poration drags, yet there
is some painfully obvious
cut content. Without
spoiling, the worst case
occurs near the end
where there is clearly an
entire sequence missing
what would have both
explored a cool idea
and developed multiple
characters. It’s absence
is clear by how abruptly
an event occurs and how
significantly the charac-
ters change afterwards.
This might sound vague
but if you do see the film
you’ll know exactly what
I mean.
I could pick apart this
film all day, but in the end,
this is the overarching
problem: Venom should
be the story of a down on
his luck man wrestling
with his humanity as an
alien parasite threatens to
turn him into a monster,
but in reality, it’s the tale
of a grumpy reporter and
his dark comedy sidekick
fighting an 80’s cartoon
villain to save the world.
This could have been a
smash hit, but instead it
makes me worried for the
upcoming ‘Into the Spi-
derverse’. There is good
to be had, but do yourself
a favour and wait till you
can stream it.
Uh-oh, someone has just seen the Rotten Tomatoes score // Sony Pictures
