Revelling in the chaos of American politics
There’s a lot up in the air right now. This is a brief survey - I’ll be back next week with much
more detail. The one thing I know is when I come to power Trump’s first against the wall.

T
he midterms are
nearly upon us,
and this is no
fun for anybody.
And before you get excit-
ed about a possible radical
change in the US federal
government, take a dose
of reality, bud. Shit slides
slowly. But, with luck,
shit will slide the right
way.
Quick refresher for
those of you not knowl-
edgeable about the US
civic process: the legisla-
ture is a bicameral system,
featuring the House (one
representative per district,
by population) and the
Senate (two senators per
state; this is the senior
house). Senators are
elected to six-year terms;
representatives are elected
to two-year terms. Hence,
in these elections, 35
Senate seats and all House
seats are up for grabs.
Unfortunately, the
election cycle is not con-
ducive to giving Trump
the complete BTFO’ing he
so desperately deserves.
23 Senate seats held
by Dems are not up for
reelection - compared to
42 on the GOP side. This
is problematic - while the
Dems are expected to pick
up a seat or two in the
Senate, it’s not looking so
good for a majority.
The good news is that
FiveThirtyEight (the most
accurate and reputable
election forecast besides
the surprisingly spot-on
proclamations of the
infamous Carl “The Dig”
Diggler, a creation of
satirists Felix Biederman
and Virgil Texas) ... ok,
sorry for the long paren-
thetical - FiveThirtyEight
predicts about a 6 in 7
(85%) chance of Demo-
crats taking a majority in
the House. Sorry for the
run-on, Charlie, I’m tired.
This is good news
because this will be suffi-
cient to produce two years
of legislative deadlock.
The unfortunate game
of obstructionism must

be played - Trump wants
to bring back asbestos,
forfuckssake. His admin-
istration is a trainwreck,
obviously. He must be
rendered impotent as
quickly as possible; a
Democratic house will
yield this result.
Moreover, the House
and Senate intelligence
committees are currently
controlled by Republi-
cans, who so far have
been primarily interested
in covering Trump’s ass,
rather than do any kind
of serious oversight. In
particular, Devin Nunes
is a bastard who should
be taken to the wall and
shot for his abandonment
of bipartisanship (he and
ranking Democrat Adam
Schiff had previously
enjoyed a good working
relationship).
This means that
previous GOP obstruction
of executive oversight,
and, say, releasing details
about the Mueller probe,
will be counteracted. This,
in turn, will help build
momentum for the 2020
race.
Speaking of the 2020
race, candidates are
angling for their runs
now, though nobody will
announce until next year.
There are tells, though -
and it looks like Sanders
will run again. This time
through, he’ll curb-stomp
the establishment Dems
(many are running, and
they’ll split the field like
the GOP did in 2016).
And the orange take
on all this? Trump’s pro-
ducing some hilariously
spicy rhetoric because
he’s shitting himself about
the midterms. Have y’all
seen that stuff about the
Caravan? Watch out, there
might be Middle Eastern-
ers in it. It’s definitely not
just Hondurans who hope
for better living condi-
tions and shelter amidst
the growing threat of
fascism in South America
(see Brazil).
It’s typical Trumpian
rhetoric, and can obvi-
ously be waved off as
hyperbolic racism. I hope
he’s panicking right now.
Come to think of it, he
should be taken out and
shot, too.
