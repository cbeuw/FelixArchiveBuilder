22nd
October,
Imperial Col-
lege Union
cancelled Imperial Left
Forum's Lockpicking
Workshop amidst vari-
ous concerns regarding
the potential numbers
that the event had at-
tracted.
The event, which had
initially been scheduled to
take place on Tuesday 23rd
October in Blackett 630,
garnered a large amount
of interest on social
media, with up to 1.7K
people "going or interest-
ed" in the Facebook event.
Members of Left Forum
described themselves as
"amazed" by the "over-
whelming response" to the
workshop, which was a
public event on Facebook.
However their hopes of
hosting their largest ever
event were dashed when
the Union asked them to
"indefinitely postpone"
the event.
Imperial Left Forum,
which launched three
years ago and has faced
opposition from the Union
in the past, describes itself
as "a broad and inclusive
political society, with
party affiliation, that dis-
cusses general politics in
both national and interna-
tional scopes." Amongst
its various events, the
society hosts talks and
reading groups, holds
screenings of political
films, and has a "mighty"
pub crawl, as well as "an-
ything else" its members
believe is a "good event
for discussing left wing
politics." Clearly, the
members of Left Forum
believed this Lockpicking
workshop to be one such
good event.
A spokesperson from
Left Forum told Felix:
"While we have been
steadily growing over the
past year, we've never had
so many people interested
in any one event. Entry to
the event was completely
free, we don't ask for any
fundingfromourmembers
and we don't get any from
the Union either. We are
all volunteers, putting in
time and effort because
we love what we're doing,
we love being part of this
society."
Members of Left Forum
described themselves as
"disheartened" to see that
the Union had cancelled
the event, especially at
such short notice. The
initial reasons provided
for cancelling the event,
whichhavebeendescribed
as a "joke" by members of
Left Forum, were that the
Union deemed the event
to be "incompatible"
with the society's values.
However, after members
of Left Forum met with
the Union, further reasons
emerged:
"It was too great a risk
for the College and the
Union, because someone
might learn from us how
to lockpick, then go
ahead and get arrested for
picking a lock and call us
out for teaching them, and
then newspapers like the
Daily Mail might pick it
up. We can't say it never
crossed my mind that the
Union wouldn't really like
our event. The fact that we
are a leftist society didn't
Imperial Left Forum's Lockpicking Workshop was sure to be a hit // Odditymall

Imperial Left Forum has faced problems from the Union in the past // Imperial Left Forum
really do us any favours
either", said the spokes-
person from Left Forum.
Left Forum is accusing
the Union of "bowing
down to undue pressure".
In a statement provided
to Felix, members of Left
Forum said:
"The event itself is
completely legal, and
much more detailed
information than what
we were going to teach
is available online, like
the famous MIT guide
to lockpicking. Alas, the
Union has decided to
censor us, to curb the free
flow of information that
should - supposedly - exist
within a university. We
see a student organization
that cares more about PR,
tabloids, and shareholders
than its own members,
especially considering the
response to the event".
Although the future
of the event remains
uncertain, the Union has
assured Left Forum that
they would eventually be
allowed to run the event,
with various restrictions.
Left Forum commented,
"we're planning to run
more security-related
events, as we think it is of
prime importance at this
point in time. We'll also
think very seriously about
the future of this event.
However, we feel obligat-
ed to report the Union's
unjust behaviour to the
student community".
