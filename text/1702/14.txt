Don’t Burn Your Bridges Before You Get To Them!
The BFI London Film Festival ran from 10th
to 21­
st
Oct, with 14 cinemas across London previewing some of the
most exciting new upcoming movies. Among Widows, Roma, Shoplifters, and Sorry to Bother You featuring on
the festival programme, is a South Korean indie movie, Burning.
“The film is
like a pot full
to the brim of
water, slowly
coming to the
boil from a
low heat—and
then someone
comes and
turns it off
before it
overflows”
T
he BFI London
Film Festival
last week drew
to a close, show-
casing films from newbie
filmmakers and seasoned
veterans from around the
globe. I was lucky enough
to catch Burning, a South
Korean noir directed by
Lee Chang-dong. Lee
offers a three-handed
hypnotic and tense drama
with impressive perfor-
mances from the central
three characters.
Burning is about an
aspiring young writer,
Jong-su (Yoo Ah-in)
struggling with various
jobs trying to write his
first novel. By chance,
he meets an unrecog-
nisable Haemi (Jeon
Jong-seo), a supposed
childhood friend. Jong-su
is entranced by Haemi’s
flirtatiousness and she
seduces him back to her
flat. Haemi asks Jong-su
a favour – to feed her shy
cat while she is travelling
in Africa; he obliges but
never manages to catch a
glimpse of the cat itself.
On her return from Africa,
Jong-su finds Haemi
with a mysterious man,
Ben (Steven Yeun). Ben
claims to have never shed
a tear, and hardly feels
sadness; he drives a fancy
sportscar and lives in a
luxurious apartment, yet
doesn’t seem to work;
he smokes weed and
burns greenhouses for
fun – one every 2 months
is his optimum ‘pace’.
When Haemi suddenly
vanishes without trace,
Jong-su wonders if Ben
has anything to do with
her disappearance.
Burning is a reim-
agining of the Haruki
Murakami short story,
Barn Burning – the
film takes liberties with
the original plot, but
Murakami’s sombre and
melancholic tone survives
in the already bittersweet
tale. This adaptation is
realised with modern
noir-thriller elements;
traces of psychopathy,
distrust, the unreliable
narrator play a big part
in this film. Moments of
tension are done effec-
tively – characters merely
talking to each other
become an increasingly
uncomfortable watch. We
expect something to snap
and the gears to grind into
place but it never happens
in the way we expect. The
film is like a pot full to
the brim of water, slowly
coming to the boil from a
low heat – before someone
comes and turns it off to
stop it overflowing. It
liberally takes its time to
breathe and ponder, and
keeps its cards close to its
chest throughout; when
the moment did come,
Burning finally revealed
what kind of a film it
really is. It subverted my
expectations, but not in a
wholly satisfying manner.
In some respects, you
could read the film as
a straightforward psy-
chological thriller, but
it clearly sets its target
higher than that. The cin-
ematography for a start,
is unusual for a noir: its
muted pastel tones and
natural lighting supports
its realism, as well as
employing a hypnotic
gaze, especially when
the frame dances around
the cursed freedom that
Haemi embodies. Focus
is tight and intimate on
the characters, rarely on
their surroundings, and

BURNING
so succeeds in making the
modern Korean landscape
as big but isolating as
possible with the limited
cast. A short motif score
of a deep bass and hand
drums weaves back and
forth into the story, but
where it is most effec-
tive is the silence it lets
occupy in the scene – it’s
sound design done with
confidence. Burning takes
a naturalistic approach
in its production, in line
with its central debate of
what’s real and not.
Many Korean films,
are rooted in politics and
Burning is no exception.
Trump is on the news
channel while the protag-
onist urinates; it’s set in
Paju,neartheDMZ,where
North Korean propaganda
broadcasts chirp in the
background of the sleepy
countryside; it talks of the
rising levels of youth un-
employment, while high-
lighting misogyny and
mistreatment of women,
classism, and hereditary
personality traits. While it
never succeeds to fully in-
tegrate coherent points on
these issues into the main
body of the film, you can
easily interpret the finale
as something other than
literal.
I enjoyed Burning
thoroughly; it was never
boring or dull, keeping
me on my toes until it
revealed itself, albeit with
a whimper. Steven Yeun
gives an impressively
measured performance,
Jeon Jong-seo confidently
expresses the melancholia
of her character, and while
Yoo Ah-in plays to our
sympathies, his character
is mostly unlikeable. It’s
easy to lose yourself in
the frame and let the en-
trancing current take you
on this trip of reflection.
