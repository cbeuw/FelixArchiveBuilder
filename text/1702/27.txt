A series of
compromising images
involving the leader
of the “Vote me, Tony
Peng, to be your next
bio social president”
campaign have
emerged
Paul Belushis
CEO @ Memeperial
T
he photographs
show the titular
political figure
and member of
Union Council, Tony
Peng, engaging in the act
of making gunfingers at
the camera in what ap-
pears to be a gathering
of more than 5 students
in the Metric nightclub.
When approached for
a comment, Peng replied
“There’s no way you’re
getting a quote from me
for your article”.
Peng rose to fame
during his tenure as
DocSoc President, in-
volved in numerous acts
of miscellaneity. Most
famous of these was the
Nuggetpocalypse that
terrorised upper Dalby
Court during his run for
Union President in the
Leadership Elections last
year, organised in tandem
with his partner in crime,
Big Fluffy Unicorn. When
approached for a comment
on the leaked photos,
BFU stated that “I can
hereby confirm that none
on the blue substance on
my colleague’s face has
any connection to unicorn
body fluids”.
During our investiga-
tion of the matter, further
images from the night
in Metric were found,
giving us clearer pictures
of the marks on Peng’s
face - hexagons, perhaps
a hint of his connection
to DocSoc. He was also
pictured with engineering
Mafia boss and DocSoc
events officer, Alasgna
Pepperonardi.
DocSoc President,
Instagramji, declined to
comment on the dealings
of her minions.
However when ap-
proached directly, Don
Pepperonardi himself
spoke of his fondness
for carbonara, confirmed
the authenticity of the
images, the presence of
former-boss Peng, and
requested that the private
conversation between
Pepperonardi and our-
selves “better not go on
Felix”.
Although initial reports
following his failed
presidential campaign in-
dicated that he had moved
into retirement, Peng may
be on the brink of a career
renaissance. This scandal
therefore arrives at an
unfortunate time for Peng,
who is now on council but

Shock as Prominent Political Leader Involved in
Blueface Scandal
This week you’re a
former Sabb Officer.
You miss the office. You
long for the respect you
once garnered from the
student body. Then you
remember Union Council.
You get over it quickly.
This week you’re Deputy
President (Welfare).
Everyone is the Union
office is watching you.
They all know you’ll be
the first to crack.
This week you’re still
pissed you didn’t make
the cut for the Techtonics.
On the bright side, at least
you don’t have to wear
those tacky red chinos.
Deffo not your colour.
This week, to save
money you decide to start
cycling.
Unfortunately your
campus is White City
and you end up getting
thrown off your bike by
an Imperial shuttle bus.
This week you’re the
Editor for Breitbart.
You’ve heard the Union
might be stocking a
spectrum of print papers
to be ‘inclusive of free
speech’. Might be time to
hit up the printing press.
This week you’re a
returning member to
Union Council. You’re
happy they moved to
a room with moveable
chairs - maybe we’ll get
some WWE style brawls
this year!
This week you’re Alice
Gast. You think you’re ill
(not freshers’ flu because
eww not the commoners)
but actually every time
a student mentions your
salary in Council you
sneeze uncontrollably.
This week you go all out
at the Farmer’s Market
because you deserve.
The pidgeons in SAF,
however, feel your pasta
could use an extra bit of
seasoning. The shit gives
it an organic crunch, no?
This week you’re a
College counsellor.
A month in and you
already know so much
about these students
they’re coming up as
recommended friends on
Facebook. What the hell.
This week, Venus, is in
retrograde, and your love
life is in jeopardy.
Coincidence? It’s more
likely that you’re just
an average Imperial
undergrad engineer.
This week you decide to
apply for a grad scheme.
You don’t realise you’re
still suffering from PTSD
after all your summer
internship rejections until
you end up on the library
floor rocking yourself.

Union Shop Extra to stock Der Stürmer
HANGMAN
Students have made
thier voices heard -
we need more racist
newspapers on our
shelves
Negafelix
Editor-in-Chief
T
he Union Shop
Extra, on Sher-
field Walkway,
is due to stock
and sell Der Stürmer
following arguments
made at Union Council
this week regarding
racist newspapers.
Aaron Barmdinger,
a concerned student,
brought forward a motion
to stop the Union from
stocking and selling
“racist tabloids” such as
The Sun, The Daily Mail,
and The Daily Express.
After a debate on Tuesday
night that went on for far
too long, the motion was
rejected.
“Look, we can’t just
ban things we don’t like”
said Worzel Gummidge, a
defender of liberty. “I per-
sonally find these views
absolutely abhorrent – are
you writing this down?
Absolutely abhorrent. But
like, you can only defeat
abhorrent ideas by bring-
ing them and shoving
it in front of everyone’s
face while repeatedly
screaming “ISN’T THIS
DISGUSTING?”. Did
I mention that I find
these views absolutely
abhorrent?” When Barmdinger was
approached for a response,
he quietly mumbled “idk
man, maybe we shouldn’t
be displaying ‘immigrants
are cockroaches and need
to die’especially after that
whole Union blackface
incident?” before walking
away, head held down.
Lynsey Dickerson,
Deputy President (Freeze
Peach), issued the fol-
lowing statement: “This
attempt to turn the Union
into Soviet Russia has
thankfully been defeat-
ed,” she said. “I mean,
just look at the science: if
you’re exposed to a virus
you become immune to it.
So if society is exposed to
more racism, it becomes
more immune to it, right?
It’s a racism vaccination
– a public service. If
anything, we need to stock
MORE racist newspapers
– 3 isn’t nearly enough to
end all racism. What? The
Union doesn’t stock the
best-selling newspaper
of Nazi Germany, Der
Stürmer? I’ll get on it at
once!”
The debate briefly
touched upon the idea of
controversial speakers.
Tom Pilfer, Deputy Presi-
dent (Best Ideas), told the
room that the best way to
deal with a society inviting
a controversial speaker
is to invite an opposing
speaker. “Look, if we
invite Tommy Robinson,
then it’s fine so long as we
offer an opposing view –
someone like, idk, Anjem
Choudary?”
