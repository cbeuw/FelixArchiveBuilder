Everybody wants to change the world:
Looking at the White Album’s Legacy 50 Years on
E
xactly fifty
years ago,
the year 1968
was to be the
beginning of the end
for the Beatles. Lennon
had finally escaped the
clutches of chronic acid
tripping, partly due to
his burgeoning love for
Yoko Ono, partly due to
the retreat the band made
to Rishikesh where they
were meant to have sworn
off drugs forever in favour
of transcendental medi-
tation. But while the trip
to India had given them
new spiritual élan and
innumerable new acoustic
material due to the tech-
nological limitations of
living in the foothills of
the Himalayas, all was not
well when they returned
to the studio. Many of the
recording sessions were
tense, with Lennon and
McCartney often pulling
in opposite directions,
while Ringo even quit the
band for a short while to
go chill out on a boat in
Sardinia (the hiatus yield-
ing one of my favourite
Beatles songs, ‘Octopus’s
Garden’).
Although the spirit
of The Beatles, their
penultimate “proper”
album, was borne out of
the spirit of revolution,
the songs bearing that
name show that they
were not completely in
tune with what the world
had in mind. The French
student protests, MLK’s
death, and the Vietnam
protests meant that the
counterculture had a new
urgency which would,
almost a decade later, lead
to the punk counterpunch
to flower power. But
Lennon’s cheeky treading
on both sides of the issue
“But when you talk about
destruction // Don’t you
know that you can count
me out (in)” shows that
the Beatles were not ready
to put their full weight
behind the aggression
brewing in the air. This
may have garnered
accusations from both
the radical left – “elitist
nonchalance in light
of injustice” – and the
radical right – “Maoists
in disguise condoning
the red apocalypse” – but
they remained unmoved,
perhaps helped by them
having quit touring. What
they would do instead
of bowing to political
pressures, was produce an
album more varied than
anything they’d made
before, using it to show
that the virtue of music
can transcend earthly
chaos.
it was, pissing off almost
as many as Lennon’s
famous quip about the
band being bigger than
Jesus. His arrogance may
have been justified by
their past three albums,
but the opener on this
one lacks the grandiosity
to do so, perhaps giving
a jet-engine-roar-tinged
glimpse at why many
doubt this album.
The mix of songs is
almost kaleidoscopic.
Many are either stories re-
counting Rishikesh drama
(‘Dear Prudence’, ‘Sexy
Sadie’) or echoes of their
folky guitar-picking in the
Indian north, like ‘Wild
Honey Pie’, ‘Mother
Nature’s Son’, ‘Julia’ and
‘Blackbird’. The last two
are Lennon’s and McCa-
rtney’s respective odes to
the opposite sex; ‘Julia’
being Lennon’s way of
telling his mother that he
has finally replaced her
with Yoko, while ‘Black-
bird’ was McCartney’s
way of showing empathy
for the civil rights
movement and helped him
win his future wife’s heart
the first time she came to
his house. ‘Blackbird’ is
an especially impressive
piece as it was recorded
and mixed in six hours.
The poignant simplicity
of it only underlines
McCartney’s genius and
single-mindedness.
While many claim that
the mixed bag of songs to
have found themselves on
the album are the reason
why it cannot be counted
amongst their best, I am
inclined to disagree. The
uniqueness of the songs
means that one can pick
out any one of them for a
single listen and not feel
like they’re missing out.
Despite their ability to be
stand-alone listens, the
whole that they form is
still somewhat coherent, if
not entirely free-flowing,
and offers an important
insight into a confusing
time for the band. Even
the songs that many love
to hate, be it the hard-
edged attempts by the
foursome to keep up with
the heavier, screeching
sounds springing up from
the UK underground in
the late 60s, like ‘Helter
Skelter’ (which helped set
off Manson’s killing spree
in sunny California) and
‘While My Guitar Gently
Weeps’ (featuring hard
rock’s morally contentious
daddy, Eric Clapton), or
the sugary nonsense of
‘Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da’ (a
song loved both by me
and Murakami, isn’t that
an esteemed fanbase),
‘Rocky Raccoon’ (who
doesn’t enjoy a wild west
love story) and ‘Honey
Pie’ (a warm-soup-like
feel-good song in the
vein of ‘When I’m Sixty
Four’), are some of my
favourite Beatles songs to
listen to.
An unfair criticism
levelled at the album is
that all the songs are too
simple and complete
nonsense. ‘Happiness Is
A Warm Gun’ stands out
as an incredibly complex
and powerful song. The
lyrics on ‘Glass Onion’
are at once revealing and
completely opaque (a
Lennon trademark), while
‘Revolution 9’ was some-
thing very revolutionary
in music indeed – Ono’s
influence was responsi-
ble for this piece which
brought the concept of
“random”, Dada-like
collage art into music.
Oh, and it also features
Ringo’s first composition
for the band, ‘Don’t Pass
Me By’.
The album that devel-
oped from a single jam
session which was half an
hour long and powerful
enough to spawn two
songs (Revolutions 1 and
9), proves that the Beatles
were still able to produce
magic even when at odds
with each other, drugged
out (the drug hiatus only
lasted while in Rishikesh;
Lennon actually ended
up on heroin), and out of
favour with the hysterical
political youth. If even
their gibberish ad-libs
can have this kind of
pop-culture influence, it
only shows why they are
the greatest of all time.

“An album

Continuing in the
tradition of all their
efforts from Help!, the
monstrous 95-minute
double album kicks off
on an unexpectedly fast
thumper of a song. The
tongue-in-cheek ‘Back
in the U.S.S.R.’, which
had the working title ‘I’m
backing the U.S.S.R.’,
incited enough outrage as
“An important
insight into a
confusing time
for the band”
