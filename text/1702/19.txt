The Wider Earth: a magical voyage of scientific
discovery
Claire Chan
Arts Editor
T
wo years old,
fresh out of uni
and off on a
five-year journey
circumnavigating the
world. That’s the story of
Charles Darwin and his
historic odyssey on the
HMS Beagle – a fantastic
tale that receives an en-
thralling dramatisation in
The Wider Earth.
The Wider Earth takes
us back to an age of
discovery and uncharted
waters. The coastlines
were yet to be fully
mapped. Photography
was not yet invented. The
tectonic movement of the
Earth’s crust remained but
an inkling in the writings
of Charles Lyell. And as
for living creatures? Few
would dare challenge the
biblical view that God
had created each living
being in its present form.
It was in this scientific
and religious climate that
HMS Beagle set sail, with
one enterprising naturalist
on board.
The production, envi-
sioned by the Australian
theatre company Dead
Puppet Society, is a
masterpiece of digital
animation, soundscape,
puppetry and traditional
theatre. Most of the action
takes place atop a large
revolving wooden struc-
ture, which undergoes a
breathtaking number of
transformations: from
barren rock to Brazilian
rainforest, from a stuffy
library at Oxford to the
storm-tossed deck of
HMS Beagle. This is
made possible by a wide
screen running overhead
across the stage, on which
stunning moving back-
drops are depicted – wa-
tercolours of the rolling
English countryside;
maps tracking the journey
of the Beagle; thunder-
storms, volcanic erup-
tions, deserts and oceans.
Lighting and sound effects
match the backdrops with
precise timing – a flash of
lightning is accompanied
by thunder rumbling
throughout the theatre,
immersing the audience
within the scene.
However, the most
unique feature of the pro-
duction is the inclusion
of over 30 extraordinary
puppets, showcasing the
diverse animals Darwin
saw on his voyage. From
a skittish iguana to two
ponderous Galapagos
tortoises, the mobile
puppets are operated

Young Darwin’s odyssey brought to life.
Beagle. While admirable,
this attempt at meaningful
political and social com-
mentary seems somewhat
out of place. Despite
being based on real events
and people, the characters
of the play come across
as quite one-dimensional.
Darwin, for instance, is
played with unrelenting
enthusiasm by Bradley
Foster, who depicts the
young naturalist as the
with lifelike skill by the
seven-person cast and add
yet another dimension of
reality to the multilayered
scenes. Looking at the
jewel-coloured butterflies
fluttering around the rain-
forest, or the odd shape
of a duck-billed platypus,
one can almost begin to
understand how awe-in-
spiring it must have been
to encounter these crea-
tures for the first time.
In addition to showing
off the wonders of the
natural world, another
theme heavily explored
in The Wider Earth is the
conflict between accepted
Christian beliefs and the
implications of Darwin’s
budding theories. Darwin,
who was originally slated
to become a pastor on his
return from the voyage,
struggles internally
against his own religious
beliefs and externally
against proponents
of Christian dogma,
represented by Captain
Fitzroy and Christian
missionaries on board the
stereotypically idealistic,
enterprising adventurer.
This stylised version
of Darwin, however, is
sufficient to convey the
message of scientific
curiosity and sheer wide-
eyed wonder that makes
The Wider Earth such a
magical experience.
Darwin’s theory
opened a path to new sci-
entific discovery. Since
his time, great leaps and
strides have been made in
our understanding of life
and the natural phenom-
ena on earth. Yet with
all our technological and
scientific progress, there
is often a sense of fatigue
– the idea that we are
making only incremental
progress on theories that
wereestablishedcenturies
ago. The Wider Earth is a
much-needed reminder
of the spirit of scientific
discovery, the beauty of
the world around us, and
the importance of looking
at old things with fresh
eyes.
