A rather uneventful week...
I
don't even want to
tell you what time it
is right now but just
know that this is by
far the latest I've written
my editorial. Every week
I tell myself that it's the
week that I will get or-
ganised and do things in
advance and, every week,
I flop the set...
With the excitement of
graduating last week, this
week feels like it's been
really dull and uneventful.
I'm genuinely wracking
my brain trying to
remember if anything of
note happened this week.
As you can probably tell,
I still don't know how to
write an editorial. At this
point, I don't think I ever
will. Alas, we ramble on...
It's perhaps quite de-
pressing and embarrass-
ing that the most eventful
thing that has happened
to me this week is attend-
ing my first ever Union
Council meeting. After
succesfully skipping the
first meeting of the year
(I'm sure I had a good
excuse), I could no longer
dodge my responsibility
as the resident fly-on-
the-wall. With no voting
rights, I sat there and
watched riveting discus-
sions and spirited debate
about topics including
Union penalties for sexual
misconduct and Ethos'
squash court pricing. A
motiontostopthestocking
and display of racist
tabloids, such as The Sun,
the Daily Mail and the
Daily Express, sparked a
particularly heated debate
which somehow spiralled
into a wider discussion
about censorship and free
speech on our campus.
It made for enthralling
viewing, with personal
attacks flying across the
room left, right and centre.
I was on the edge of my
seat and the only thing I
regret is not bringing my
popcorn. There were even
some afters between two
Union Council members
which may or may not
have been accidentally

Felix is recruiting!
We want you – yes, you! We’re looking for writers, photographers, editors, illustrators, report-
ers, computer experts and grammar nerds to join our team. No experience needed – we’ll teach
you everything you need to know. If you’re interested, send us an email on felix@ic.ac.uk

In all seriousness,
although Council overran,
was slightly tedious (so
much so that ended my
self-imposed football
boycott and was driven
to watching Mourinho's
Manchester United team's
attempts to play football
for entertainment), the
discussions had at Council
were very important and
raise further interesting
points about the sort of
community and envi-
ronment we want to be a
part of at Imperial. I urge
anybody reading to get
more involved in Council
and to attempt to effect
change. Of course, that
means nothing because
nobody is still reading
my incessant rambling
anyway...
I'd like to end my edito-
rial this week by thanking
everybody that reached
out after reading my
editroial last week. The
kind words, condolences
and heartwarming offers
of support have kept me
going through what's been
a tough few weeks. I found
it incredibly difficult to
write my letter to Lauren
but I felt slightly better af-
terwards and I really hope
that it was able to be some
comfort to anyone that
knew and loved her. The
College is organising a
Book of Condolences for
us to take up to her family
in time for the funeral
next week. Anybody who
would like to contribute
can send their thoughts
and messages via email to:

Accounts filed this
month by the Sackler
Trust show 12 entities
received grants last year
of more than £150,000,
along with 53 miscella-
neous donations of less
than that figure. Benefi-
ciaries included the Royal
Court’s resident company,
the English Stage
Company (£700,000),
Alexandra Park and
Palace Charitable Trust
(£500,000), the Old Vic
(£300,000), the National
Theatre (£250,000) and
the Roundhouse arts and
concert venue (£225,000).
While it is unclear if neg-
ative publicity had been a
factor, the Sackler Trust’s
grants last year have
dwindled in comparison
to the £21m given in 2016.
Among the most active
critics of the Sacklers and
Purdue Pharma has been
the artist Nan Goldin, who
recently recovered from
a near-fatal addiction to
OxyContin and has staged
direct actions inside US
arts institutions funded by
the family. Nan provided
comment, saying: “One of
our goals is to try to force
the hand of the museums
and other institutions to
refuse future funding.”
Ryan Hampton, a US
campaigner who is in
recovery from a dec-
ade-long opioid addiction,
said that the only accept-
able philanthropy for the
Sacklers to pursue was in
“supporting resources and
finances that will end the
opioid crisis that poured
billions into Purdue
Pharma”. He added: “The
Sacklers are the direct
beneficiaries of the vast
and profound suffering
created by purposefully
misleading doctors about
their company’s products.
Co-opting our cultural
institutions is reputa-
tion-laundering and it’s a
distraction.”
The Sackler family
members being sued in
the case include Theresa
and Beverly, the widows
of the brothers, Mortimer
and Raymond Sackler,
who grew Purdue Pharma
into a pharmaceutical
empire. Forbes mag-
azine estimates that a
core group of 20 family
members in the Mortimer
and Raymond Sackler
branches of the family are
collectively worth $13bn
(£10bn).
