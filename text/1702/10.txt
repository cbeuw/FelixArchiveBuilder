L
ast week,
Loughborough
U n i v e r s i t y
announced they
would be launching an
investigation into two
of its students, result-
ing in the immediate
suspension of one. This
was the University’s
response to what it
referred to as a “racist
and misogynistic” post
on the “Loughborough
Towersposting” Facebook
group, a student run
meme page. The offensive
picture was posted to the
“Discussion” section of
the meme page by one of
the students, an area where
the posts are not vetted by
the admins. The student
that made the post was
suspended, and the other
student was an admin for
the page. Should both
receive the same punish-
ment? Perhaps not, but the
incident sets a scary prec-
edent for how Universities
should deal with student
Facebook groups made in
their name.
Memeperial, Imperi-
al’s own meme page, has
around 10,000 likes at
time of writing. College
is obviously aware of
the page, as they have
“borrowed” content
from them on multiple
occasions. However,
no action has ever been
taken against the admins
of the group, nor has
any contact been made
between the admins of
the page and College
staff, despite some posts
erring on the edgy side.
Similar to Loughbor-
ough Towersposting,
Memeperial also has a
visitor posts section.
Crucially, posts in this
section do not require
admin approval to be
shared on the page, and
so the same issue could
occur here. That the
admin for the page is
being held accountable
for what a user has sub-
mitted is ridiculous, but
universities should have
some influence in what
is posted using their
name and image. That
the influence should
extend to suspension of
students is awful.
I can understand
taking action against a
student who intention-
ally posts content that
can bring the college
into disrepute. The
college has a reputation
to uphold and donations
from alumni and associ-
ations with companies
to protect. But what
if a graduate posts
damaging or offensive
content? How about
a student of another
university? Without the
option of suspension,
would these institutions
opt for a legal route to
punish such pages? The
latter example is not just
a thought experiment:
Anglia Ruskin Memes
(a page about Anglia
Ruskin University of all
things) is run by Cam-
bridge Uni students.
Who is supposed to
punish them if they
post unsavoury content?
Would Cambridge Uni-
versity take action and
suspend the students?
Would Anglia Ruskin
take legal action?
While University
should be a place where
students are able to
express themselves
freely, an important part
of being a student is
being treated as a pro-
fessional: this is where
your career begins.
Student activity can and
does affect the bottom
line of universities,
either through donations
from alumni or affecting
admissions. That pages
expect freedom to
publish anything they
want while using their
University’s crest badly
photoshopped to include
Pepe the Frog is unrea-
sonable. But freedom
to criticise the uni you
pay so much to attend
is equally a vital part of
the student experience,
as shown by the wealth
of media run by and
presented to students in
almost every university
in the country.
Indeed, the content
on many of these pages
is of a similar nature
to that published by
student newspapers,
operating outside the
influence of the faculty.
Often critical of their
university, or faculties
thereof, they are mostly
free to post and publish
whatever they want. Yet
these pages don’t benefit
from the protections
and rights extended to
them by the unions that
fund these institutions.
Perhaps unions adopting
their related pages
would solve this issue,
providing protection for
the admins of the pages,
while adding some nec-
essary checks on what
is and isn’t posted in the
universities name.
The actions taken by
Loughborough Univer-
sity have resulted in
student pages being shut
down, and this a trend
that we’re beginning to
see in universities across
the country. That a large
part of the community
and modern student ex-
perience has been taken

“The admin
should not
be held
accountable
for what the
user publicly
posted”
away is such a shame.
With student newspa-
pers and student unions
seemingly unwilling or
unable to fill this niche,
meme pages are able to
tap into an undercurrent
of the student experi-
ence that adds a new
dimension to university
life. Perhaps that is why
Imperial is so willing
to allow Memeperial
to continue posting its
shite, as long as it does
nothing to damage their
bottom line. Whether it
is adoption by the union,
or some other solution,
these pages need to find
a way to stay afloat,
while monitoring the
content posted.
