mperial College
London has been
revealed to be the
largest UK benefi-
ciary of donations from
the controversial and
much-maligned Sackler
Trust, receiving £2.5m
last year.
The Sackler family
has come under recent
scrutiny amidst the US
opioid addiction and
overdose crisis. Last year,
the family donated £7m
through its philanthropic
trust to British institu-
tions, including the Old
Vic, the National Theatre
and several other UK
cultural and educational
institutions. As reported
by numerous national
newspapers, including
The Guardian, Imperial
College London was the
largest beneficiary, fol-
lowed by Royal Museums
Greenwich, which re-
ceived £1.5m. A student at
Imperial College London,
who asked to remain
anonymous, told Felix:
“Imperial being the
largest beneficiary of
this dodgy money, who
would’ve thought?”.
The Sackler family’s
influential philanthropic
role has come under the
spotlight after allegations
that the transatlantic dy-
nasty’s fortune has been
tainted by the US opioid
crisis. Much of the fami-
ly’s wealth has come from
OxyContin, the prescrip-
tion painkiller launched in
1996 that has been a major
aggravator in the opioid
addiction and overdose
crisis that kills more than
100 people in the US.
Data has revealed that US
drug overdose deaths rose
to a record 72,000 last
year. Purdue Pharma and
members of the Sackler
family, including Theresa
Sackler, a director of the
Sackler Trust and one of
the UK’s most prolific
arts philanthropists, are
being sued by the US
state of Massachusetts.
The Massachusetts case is
being watched closely by
some UK institutions, as
pressure from US activists
on galleries and museums
funded by the Sacklers in-
creases, casting a shadow
over their activities in
the UK. A spokesperson
for Imperial College said
it received charitable
donations from a range
of sources that helped
strengthen its research
and education through
scholarships, academic
positions, research centres
and capital projects. The
source added:
“All donations are con-
sidered carefully under
our relationship review
and gift acceptance
policies, and we keep all
relationships with third
parties under continuous
review”.
