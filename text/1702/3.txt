New Provost in Town
NEWS
Felix sat down with
Ian Walmsley, the new
Provost of Imperial
College London, to
reflect on his first
month on the job
Andy Djaba
Editor-in-Chief
P
rofessor Ian
Walmsley FRS,
who started
his new role
as Provost of Imperial
College London on 1st
September, sat down
with Felix for an exclu-
sive interview.
The Imperial alumnus
and world-renowned
expert in ultrafast and
quantum optics, who
joined the College from
his role as Pro-Vice-Chan-
cellor (Research and
Innovation) at the
University of Oxford to
succeed Professor James
Stirling, lets Felix know
what makes him tick.
Felix: Not to be blunt
but… what does
the Provost do? The
statement on the
website says, "the
Provost is Imperial’s
chief academic officer
and provides the
leadership to ensure
excellenceinImperial’s
coreacademicmission
in education, research
and translation" but,
In layman’s terms,
what does that mean?
Ian: It’s a very good
question because it’s not
a job that I was v ery
familiar with from my
time at Oxford, which has
a very different structure.
Imperial is unique in the
UK in the way that it
has structured its senior
leadership so it’s an ex-
ploration for me as well
but what I found attractive
about it was that it was a
position where develop-
ing the overall academic
strategy of the institution
and figuring out how you
would implement that and
resource it was key. So
whether that's around our
global research position
or the student experience.
Doing this is quite an
exciting opportunity
Is there a typical day
for the Provost or is
every day different?
I’ve only been here
a month so no typical
day yet! I haven’t got
to that point yet but, at
the moment, what I’m
spending my time doing
is going around getting
to know people, getting
to know the Heads of
Faculty and Heads of
Departments, visiting all
the departments over the
course of the next few
months, academics, junior
researchers, students, staff
and getting a feel for the
key issues and aspirations.
Learning a bit about that
will help inform how we
develop the academic
strategy in the future.
How would you
describe your first
month?
Very exciting. It’s
always great to be in a
new place and learn about
what’s going on. But cer-
tainly there’s a lot of stuff
coming at me so trying to
get some of that to stick
and start figuring out how
things fit with one another
has been the challenge I
think.
You were a student
here.Didyouhaveany
impressions about
what the job would
be like and have they
changed? Have you
been surprised by
anything since you
started working here?
Ihadhadquiteanumber
of research collaborations
with colleagues, mainly
in Physics, and also on
other projects with senior
leaders here so I had a
sense of the place and
the sort of dynamism and
agility that it has, which I
think was quite attractive.
Learning about how that’s
working and how one
might help improve that
sort of thing has been the
new sort of things that I’m
beginning to see. In terms
of surprises, only that it
always looks more ex-
citing than you think it’s
going to be but nothing
that has made me think
that I have at all made the
wrong decision.
What inspired you to
study Physics?
Certainly I found the
idea of learning about
the way the world is at
its fundamental structure
just fascinating so I got
really fired up about it. I
had some good teachers
in school that, when I was
thinking about what to do
with that, pointed me to
Imperial and I’m really
glad they did because the
idea of a university where
you could study with
world leading researchers,
living in London, was
absolutely the right thing
for me to do. The course
here, the people I worked
with, the people I met,
continued to drive that.
I felt I had a really great
start here and I’m really
grateful for that.
Here at Imperial,
Physics has
unfortunately got
quite a low student
satisfaction. Do
you have any plans
to tackle the low
student satisfaction,
particularly in Physics,
but across other
subjects?
It’s really disappointing
that we’re in that circum-
stance and we absolutely
havetofixit.Ithinkthere’s
no reason why every
student here shouldn’t
really feel that they are
getting not only a good
education but are part of
a thriving environment
and community. I think
that’s the way we need to
roll here. I met with the
Head of Physics just this
morning to learn about the
plans that she is putting
in place to really change
the dial and engage with
students to understand
what it is that’s missing,
how they might fix it and
I’m impressed that has
happened rapidly and
with intention to change
things. Simone, the
Vice-Provost (Education)
is also working with that
group to understand how
we share best practice
across the College. Places
that have done extremely
well, like some of the
Engineering departments,
what are the things that
they’ve been doing and
how do we determine
whether those will work in
other places? That’s now
getting underway and it’s
absolutely the case that
we need to get this right.
You say some of the
plans are already
getting underway,
which specific plans
are already in place?
Looking at ways to
change the workload
so you still get to learn
the things you need to
but in a way that gives
a bit more time for
thinking. Student-staff
interaction- making sure

“I think there's
no reason why
every student
here shouldn't
really feel
that they are
getting not
only a good
education
but are part
of a thriving
environment
and
community.”
“If you look at
our diversity
profile in
academics, not
only in terms
of race but also
in terms of
gender, there's
clearly much
work to be
done”
that the students and
academics are part of the
same community and that
people know one another.
Figuring out how to find
study space for students
and things of that kind.
All of these I think are
about building the stu-
dent-academic interaction
and making sure that
what is being asked of
the students is reasonable,
without shirking on the
expectation that they’re
going to have to work
hard to do well.
learning environment and
an education where the
best students and best ac-
ademics are learning side
by side. That seems to me
where we should be. We
already have a really fan-
tastic set of academics and
some really great students
so I think the core of that
is there and our challenge
is now how do we invest
in that to really ensure that
we are globally visible
and globally competitive.
In terms of investing
in that, what do you
see as your input in
shaping how Imperial
becomes more spoken
about on a global
scale
Taking our academic
strategy and vision and
making that into a very
clear narrative that we
can use externally to
show how Imperial is
pushing the boundaries
of knowledge and using
that knowledge for the
benefit of the world and
providing people with
opportunities to learn
within that is a core
thing. Drawing together
that strategy and making
it into a strong external
vision. Also, figuring out
how we implement that.
We’re not going to be able
to do everything at once so
how do we plan that out,
prioritise and move along
that trajectory? You’ll
be aware of the great op-
portunities around White
City, around the Master-
plan for this campus and
all of the plans that the
faculties have.
Last year there were
the UCU strikes. What
are your thoughts on
the fallout from the
strikes and what is
the College doing to
ensurethatsomething
like the strikes doesn’t
happen again?
Just as we talked about
the student experience and
the student community
needs to be a valued part
of the institution, that’s
certainly true for the staff
as well and the pensions
are clearly a part of that.
Of course I wasn’t here
when the discussion was
going on earlier but what
we’re now going to take
forward is we’ve got... a
consultation from USS
and UUK coming up.
We’re going to talk with
academics about their re-
sponse to the recommen-
dations or the suggestions
that have been made and
how we respond to that
consultation. I think it’s a
whole College conversa-
tion so that we can come
up with a plan that is good
for individuals and good
for the College as a whole.
How is the university
preparing for Brexit,
what do you think
will be the effect of
a no-deal Brexit on
Imperial?
Clearly Brexit is a
major change coming
up in the next year and
it would be silly to think
it won’t have an impact
on the College. I think a
key issue, probably the
leading issue, is how does
it affect people. We’ve
got a lot of European
staff and students and we
want to make sure that
they consider themselves
absolutely part of the
community and valued.
We will continue to work
to make sure that happens.
We’re going to remain a
globally facing institu-
tion. That’s not going to
change in intent. So all
we’re doing is navigating
our way through when
the new legislation comes
down the line. In terms of
other impacts, we do get
a considerable amount of
research income from the
EU and it may be that that
changes in some way. It’s
still up in the air entirely
just what our relationship
with the European Union
will be. It’s a little bit
crazy but the signs from
government have always
been very positive that
research engagement is
important for the UK.
With a forward plan that’s
based on an industrial
strategy, you just can’t
afford not to have world
leading ideas generation
and exploitation in this
country. So I hope that we
come to a position where
we can continue to par-
ticipate in the framework
programs in some way.
Doyouhaveanyplans
for Arts at imperial?
This morning I was
just meeting with Ollie
at the Blyth centre and
learning about what
fantastic contribution that
makes to College life. We
talked a little bit about
that aspect of what the
Blyth Centre might be
looking for in the future
and may be looking to do.
I cannot say I have plans
yet but that part of the
College, coupled with the
location that we’re in, this
fantastic agglomeration
of museums and colleges,
has got to provide some
really cool opportunities.
The Dyson School of
Design Engineering and
that joint masters course
between Imperial and the
Royal College of Art is
just a wonderful example
of the kind of things we
can do. There’s joint
programs with the Royal
College of Music, Physics
and Maths I think. That’s
great as well. The raw
material we have is really
fantastic and I’m sure
there’s something that can
happen.
Will Freedom of
Speech on campus be
protected?
Yes absolutely. It’s
crucial that people are
able to speak their minds
and we should do that in
an environment of dignity
and respect for that dis-
course.
October is Black
History Month. I just
wrote about the Race
Equality Charter and
the Equality Diversity
and Inclusion strategy
(EDI). For the last
ten years there have
been less than 5 black
lecturers. In terms
of speaking more
broadly about EDI
and also tackling this
direct issue where
there’s not that much
diversity in the senior
lecturerposition,what
are yours and the
College’s plans?
I think you’re abso-
lutely right. If you look
at our diversity profile in
academics, not only in
terms of race but also in
terms of gender, there’s
clearly much work to be
done. The strategy and
its implementation I think
are one way we get started
on that but we do need to
be very active in looking
at ways to change that
balance. Again, I don’t
have a detailed plan for
you at this stage but we’ll
certainly do that in the
context of world leading
excellence in research
and education- that will
be the benchmark and
we’ll work within that
framework and the EDI
strategy to make sure that
we increase representation
from those groups
How do you spend
your free time? Do you
have any?
I like to cycle. I try to go
out on weekends and ride
around the countryside.
My wife is the Director of
Chapel music at Wadham
in Oxford so I sing in her
choir when I can.
Do you enjoy being an
academic?
Yeah I do. I’ve really
had a career that I’ve
really enjoyed at every
stage and the idea that you
can think about the world
and think about the way
in which your ideas can
impact it and work with
great young students and
What would you say
is the single biggest
problem that Imperial
has and your biggest
challenge in taking
up the role? How do
you see the future of
Imperial and how you
can help to shape that
future?
I think the opportunity
that Imperial has is as
a world leading higher
education institution that
really is globally compet-
itive. That’s mentioned up
there in the same breath as
MIT and the places that
are driving the forefront of
research, coupled together
with a cutting edge, really
vibrant teaching and
young people has just
been fantastic. Wouldn’t
change it.
What advice would
you give to a student
or someone just
starting out in their
career, in academia or
a wider career?
Keep at it. Work hard,
have confidence in your-
self and just push along.
Which was your fav
Love Island couple?
I have to say I did not
catch Love Island so I
can’t really address that
question. I have only very
recently really briefly
understood the concept of
Love Island.
