Trust your Trustees?
Our Union loves touting its democratic credentials, but how much of what goes on do we
really know about?
COMMENT

O
ne month,
and one more
record-breaking
election, has
already passed here at
Imperial. Last week, new
student reps were elected
in every department, and
though turnout figures are
certainly worth celebrat-
ing, today I want to talk
about what comes next.
Every day decisions
are made in our name
that we never really hear
about: at College and de-
partmental meetings, by
Union Council (made up
of elected student reps),
and by the Union’s Board
of Trustees (a handful of
students and externally
appointed‘laypeople’,and
our sabbatical officers).
Even when items are
technically public, there’s
a limit to the amount of
digging its reasonable to
expect full time students
to be doing in their off-
hours, and mass emails
are far from perfect (does
anyone read them?).
Last year I was elected
to Trustee Board on a
platform of transparency,
and with that in mind I will
be writing articles period-
ically to let any interested
students know what’s
going on in the Union
and more generally at the
university. I won’t pretend
to be impartial, but I will
try to explain things with
which I disagree in good
faith. I’d encourage you to
at least skim these pieces;
there will almost certainly
be at least one or two
things in here that matter
to you, and it’s difficult to
do anything about them
without being informed.
Where the union’s power lies // Imperial College Assets
“Providing
fairly priced
services for
students may
involve a
different way
of allocating
the budget”
Course content in
every department is
being reviewed
I’ve mentioned this
before, but its probably
the single most impor-
tant thing happening on
campus this year. Depart-
ments have until March to
finalise their proposals on
changes to their curricula,
and though your academic
reps should already be
aware of and involved in
this process, it wouldn’t
hurt to nudge them if you
have any concerns. Search
for “Imperial College
Representatives” if you
don’t know who they are.
Room bookings
This has been the cause
of a lot of frustration for
many societies so far this
year. Consternation at the
slow pace of change here
is understandable, given
that this isn’t the first time
there have been issues
around room bookings.
I’ve been told that part of
the problem this year has
been that clubs’ annual
bookings took so long to
validate that start of term
ad hoc bookings were
disrupted. Conversations
are currently taking place
around automating the
former to leave more time
for the latter. Hopefully,
this approach and the
Deputy President (Clubs
and Societies)’s focus on
“improving processes”
will help ameliorate this
issue, and I intend to keep
raising it until there is a
real solution.
Squash Courts/Ethos
A paper was brought to
the last Council meeting
discussing pricing at
the Ethos squash courts
relative to other venues.
Naturally, the debate
touched on the wider issue
of the Ethos price hike
where (lest we forget) the
university broke its word
to all returning students
and increased the charge
from a one off £40 to
£30/year. This would be a
great rate for consumers,
but we aren’t consumers,
we’re students. Imperial
as a whole, runs a sig-
nificant surplus (£119m
in 2016-17), orders of
magnitude greater than
its projected gains on
this price hike. It is also
worth noting that direct
student contributions still
constitute a relatively
small proportion of the
Ethos budget, begging the
question – why increase
these rates at all?
Considering this, one
of the most important
points raised at Council
challenged the idea that
in order to fund (for
example) cheaper squash
courts, Sport Imperial
would have to take money
from one of their other
offerings. These budgets
aren’t zero sum games,
each service doesn’t exist
in a vacuum. Providing
fairly priced, comprehen-
sive services for students
may involve reaching
beyond preordained de-
marcations in the budget
and questioning the
underlying assumptions
College uses to decide
where its money goes.
Pay rises for student
bar staff
Last year, the bar staff
organised a petition for
pay to be increased to
the London Living Wage,
in line with other major
London universities
(notably UCL, KCL,
LSE). This petition
garnered over 900 signa-
tures, though at the time
the Union and the then
Deputy President (Finance
and Services) rejected the
move to a Living Wage.
Their rejoinder was that
money could be better
spent elsewhere and price
rises should be avoided,
though it should be noted
prices did end up rising
anyway.
This year, agitation
around pay increases has
restarted, citing the taxing
nature of the work - par-
ticularly in conjunction
with full time study, the
pay at other student bars,
and potential alternative
sources of funding (i.e.
without raising prices
in the bar). Thus far, the
outcomes of this remain
to be seen.
Postgraduate (PG)
Representation
Physics PG Rep and
Natural Sciences PG Rep
to Council Lloyd James
has been working on the
issue of PG engagement
and representation at
Imperial. His proposal
consists of steps that
would give PG students
the opportunity to par-
ticipate more actively

Where the real power lies // Imperial College Assets
“Societies
should be
able to host
events without
interfence if
they’re not
violating any
rules”
in the relevant Constit-
uent Unions (CGCU,
ICSMSU, RCSU, RSMU)
which currently solely
cater to undergraduate
students. This would not
affect their membership of
the GSU. A discussion on
this matter will take place
at the next Union Council
meeting November 13th,
6.30 in RSM G.01. These
meetings are public, so
feel free to attend.
Graduation Speech.
Union President Rob
Tomkies was prevented
from giving his own
speech at the graduation
ceremony this year and
was instead compelled to
deliver the same prepared
remarks as in every prior
year since 1949. While
there’s nothing necessar-
ily wrong with tradition,
the existing address’
appeals to monarchism,
imperialism and nation-
alism (in both Latin and
English) miss the mark for
a cosmopolitan university
in the 21st century. Rob
is currently working with
College to ensure future
speeches of this kind
better reflect our values.
Penalties for Sexual
Misconduct
Daniel Wigh, Chair of
the ‘Knowledge Sector’
(which handles admin for
thesetofclubsfocussedon
careers, debate and educa-
tion, such as FinanceSoc
and Debate) successfully
passed a paper at Council
toughening punishment
for those found guilty of
non-minor instances of
sexual misconduct. Going
forward, in addition to
other sanctions, these
individuals would be
prevented from holding
any elected office in the
Union (i.e. as a rep or on
any society committee).
Given issues in this area
in the past, this is a highly
commendable step. As
was said in the meeting,
any student should be
able to take for granted
that their fellow students
in positions of power
haven’t acted abusively.
Stocking of Tabloids
in the Union Shop
Ansh Bhatnagar,
Undergraduate Rep to
Council from Natural
Sciences, proposed
a paper mandating
the Union to cease its
stocking and selling of the
Daily Express, Daily Mail
and the Sun, due to their
explicitly racist content.
This led to an impassioned
debate on free speech vs.
what we’re comfortable
promoting, with a com-
promise that these papers
will remain in stock but
any proceeds from their
sale will be directed to an-
ti-racist campaign groups,
and the Union will take
a more active stance in
raising complaints against
inflammatory articles.
Divest Imperial.
Twice in as many
weeks, students from
Divest Imperial, the
campaign pushing
College to withdraw
its investments from
Fossil Fuels, have been
displaced by Campus
Security for handing
out fliers and holding
up placards near where
events with government
and fossil fuel companies
are being held on campus.
Given that their protests in
these cases were not dis-
ruptive, and that we have
a mandate to protect free
speech, I will be working
to lessen this kind of
undue interference, and
hope and expect for Union
backing to this end.
Left Forum Event
A “Lockpicking
Workshop” event organ-
ised by the Imperial Left
Forum was this week
indefinitely postponed by
the Union. The organisers
were told this was because
the content of the event did
not match up well to the
aims and objectives of the
society, while at a Trustee
Board meeting the sabbat-
ical officers also cited the
large number of responses
on the Facebook event
(1.6K going or interested)
as a concern, as well as the
large numbers of non-stu-
dents responding to the
event and the lack of an
event budget (though I’m
not sure one was neces-
sary in this case). My own
view is that, once any
practical considerations
around e.g. numbers are
resolved, the event should
go ahead. Our societies
should be able to host
their own events without
interference if they aren’t
violating any rules around
(for example) inclusivity
or financial responsibility.
NSS/PTES Response
Responses to the
National Student Survey
and Postgraduate-Taught
Experience Survey were
produced (in record time)
by this year’s Deputy
President (Education)
Alex Luy. The responses
include recommendations
on training for weaker
members of staff and re-
viewing marking criteria.
The full documents are
available on the Union
website.
Summer Ball
Given concerns
around space and student
numbers, it is possible
there will be a search for
an alternative (off-cam-
pus) venue for the 2020
Summer Ball.
This is far from a com-
prehensive list, and some
key issues such as the
fight for a common room
for Life Scientists and the
Counselling Service will
appear in future articles.
Nonetheless, I hope this
has been a useful window
into goings-on in the
Union. If there’s anything
you want further clarifica-
tion on, or anything you
would like me to raise,
