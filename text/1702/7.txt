What do Ellie
Goulding, Ricky Martin
and the Queen have in
common? Other than the
fact that they all used to
be much more relevant 3
years, 20 years and 800
years ago respectively,
they also all took part
in the royal wedding
celebrations over the
weekend. Very much
overshadowed by the
spectacle of a ginger
man actually finding a
wife earlier this year,
this royal wedding
was between Princess
Eugenie and a rich white
man. Whenever an
event like this happens,
the age old question
about the legitimises
and appropriateness of
a monarchy in modern
Britain arises.
The opulence of the
royal family in an aus-
terity induced poverty
stricken Britain is
reason enough to abolish
this institution entirely.
Even without looking
into the nitty gritty of
costs versus benefit of
having a royal family,
this symbol of elitism
has no place in modern
Britain. Institutions,
such as universities, are
trying hard to combat
elitism and increase
social mobility. A rich
family who have found
themselves at the apex
of British society due to
circumstance alone will
not help in inspiring.
One of the ways
Imperial tries to encour-
age students from all
backgrounds to apply is
by running open days.
As a prospective student
enters the glass castle
that is the Business
School, the first thing
they will come across
is a statue of Queen
Victoria looking down
at them. This monarch
had a role in the creation
of Imperial College,
placing the foundation
stone for in 1888 and
going on to open the
building in 1893. She
lay the foundations
for one of the greatest
scientific institutions
in the world, but also
during her lifetime she
lay the foundation for
something much more
destructive: racism.
The British policy of
colonialism and imperi-
alism reached it peaked
under her reign and can
be attributed to much of
the racism, xenophobia
as well as the plethora
of wars and problems
which we have faced in
the last century as well
as ones happening today.
When it comes to
racism, it may seem far
fetched to link it back to
events which happened
150 years ago, however
it is clear that the seeds
of racism were sown a
long time ago and the
harvest is still plentiful.
As Britain went around
the world and oppressed
the local people, its
actions created the
image of the strong and
powerful white man.
Additionally, it became
clear that to justify this
oppression, the idea
that these local people
were inferior had to be
solidified in not only
the minds of the people
being colonized, but
also in the minds of the
British public at home.
As Britain pillaged much
of Asia and Africa of its
resources and created
this racial hierarchy, the
stands in the Business
School, watching every
student scurry by, she
sees many of us not as
international students
but as colonial students.
Having a lady who
contributed to horrors
in the home countries
of many of the students
here standing so proudly
is bound to send a few
shivers down a few
spines and for this very
reason, British colonial
history and the crowns
part in it must be ad-
dressed.
While many see
Meghan Markle as a
symbol for change in
the British monarchy,
bringing in a little of
racial diversity. Is it not
too little too late? Can

spines.”
royals grew richer and
more powerful. Queen
Victoria went on to be
named Empress of India
in 1876 despite never
visiting the country and
such irony is but a short
summary of much of
what colonialism went
on to become. A white
European, ruling with
little to no knowledge or
regard to what the local
people wanted, and the
royals were at the centre
and embodiment of this.
Imperial College is
a very international
university with students
from across the world.
But as Queen Victoria
ican royal change the
deeply rooted racism
which sits in many?
Or is abolishing the
monarchy and confront-
ing its colonial past the
only way in truly tearing
down the entire idea of
racism?
