Free this weekend? Go to MozFest!
T
his weekend will
mark the biggest
party on the
World Wide Web
not on the World Wide
Web – Mozilla Festival or
“MozFest”.
Organized by Mozilla,
the creators of that web
browser with the fire-
tailed fox as its logo,
Mozilla Festival is a
festival like no other.
Mozilla Festival will
be split into six zones –
Decentralization, Digital
Inclusion, Openness,
Privacy and Security,
Web Literacy, and the
Youth Zone. These are
physical spaces (each
occupies an entire floor of
the building) embodying
some of the most innova-
tive and radical ideas and
movements in cyberspace.
Each zone invites you to
explore the theme through
workshops, discussions,
art, and mini-hackathons.
For a taste, the titles range
from “Lab CoC: Why we
need codes of Conduct and
how to get them into every
research laboratory” to
“BRRRAAaaaaiiiiNNN-
NZZZZZ!!!!” (the latter
one encouraging you to
become a neuroscientist
and not a zombie). For
those for whom loving the
Internet equates to endless
hours of Overwatch, there
will also be throughout
the event a large-scale,
dynamic game called
“Tracked”.
Alongside this will be
talks by leading figures
from the open source
movement including a
talk on Saturday by the
founder of the World Wide
Web, Tim Berners-Lee,
about what he has been
doing since then.
If this isn’t enough, the
tickets are only £45 for the
entire weekend, with over
300 talks, unlimited hot
drinks, entry to a party on
Saturday night, and break-
fast on Sunday where you
will get a chance to talk
with some of the other
hackers, technologists
and journalists eager to
improve the web.
With the increasingly
tangible influence of the
internet on the offline
world, from its part in the
election of Donald Trump
to blockchain technology
and the sudden explosion
of internet-connected
devices in the developing
world, there has never
been a time when the
freedom and openness
of the World Wide Web
has been more pertinent.
As well as being a cel-
ebration of the World
Wide Web, MozFest is an
exploration and reaction
to the potential harm that
it can have. Last year, the
first festival after the 2016
US presidential elections,
talks included “What
happened to the internet?”
and “Debunking Fake
News and Fake Science”.
This year will almost cer-
tainly focus heavily on the
effects of the Cambridge
Analytica case with a
panel discussion, “Who
Controls the Internet?”,
on Sunday and workshops
on how to use Facebook
without compromising
your privacy.
The Internet is part
of everyone’s lives and
equally Mozilla Festival
is open to and attended by
people from all walks of
life. In 2017, the director
of Wikimedia asked for a
show of hands from the
audience to see how they
identified themselves – as
a technologist, journalist,
artist, scientist, activist,
or just an average internet
user. The audience was
split almost equally
between the categories.
When I attended last
year the only regret I had
was that technology has
not progressed sufficient-
ly that I can have a digital
clone to attend the other
events happening simul-
taneously.
If MozFest sounds like
your kind of party be sure
to grab tickets for the
event from the website
https://mozillafestival.
org/tickets. Tickets: £45
for the weekend, £20 for
Saturday (including night
party at the RSA), £25 for
Sunday. Doors open at
8:00 Saturday, 9:00 on
Sunday.
