Venom: The Worst Kind of Bad Film
found really engaging.
It’s the worst kind of
bad film: passion and
talent are on display and
at some point this thing
could have been truly
great. But it isn’t. Let’s
talk about why.
There is some good to
be found here. Tom Hardy
is as brilliant as always,
and he brings depth and
charisma to Eddie Brock
through his performance,
despite some poor script-
ing. Michelle Williams
does a fine job as Eddie’s
ex-girlfriend Anne. Their
chemistry is decent and
is a defiance of cliché;
you never get the sense
she secretly wants him
or would take him back.
I found Anne’s new
boyfriend Dan, played by
Reid Scott, to be another
cliché dodge as he seems
like a genuinely good
person and never feels
like his relationship is
threatened by Eddie. In
fact, you get the feeling
this new relationship is
far healthier than Eddie
and Anne’s, a dimension
I’m sure would have been
explored if this film had a
more adult rating.
Venom himself looks
very comic-esque in a
really good way and the
design of the loose symbi-
otes is suitably weird and
alien . There is the occa-
sional animation quality
dip, but for the most part
it does the job. There are
some solid action beats
too. The motorcycle chase
featured in the trailer is
excellent and does an
adequate job establishing
Venom’s powers. There
is also a pretty good fight
scene with a SWAT team
later on, though the films
climax is an incomprehen-
sible mess with absolutely
no stakes.
And with that let’s
segue into the bad. A
huge amount of this film
is taken up following
Carlton Drake, a painfully
generic villain playing the
‘humans are imperfect,
I will bring a new age of
evolution’ card. Puddle
deep, in no way relatable,
the worst type of villain.
Drake is the head of Stock
Amoral Corporation
who made millions...
somehow. Like, they’re
a pharmaceuticals de-
velopment group who
illegally test on homeless
people, but they also have
multiple high tech space
shuttles that they use to
search asteroids because
maybe there is a miracle
cure in space? It’s clearly
a case of trying to create
an antagonist more evil
than the protagonist so we
don’t have to deal with any
complex morality. This is
also probably why, by the
end of it, Venom (a classic
comic book villain) is just
another defender of earth.
Oh, and the final boss is so
dull and underdeveloped I
can’t even be bothered to
discuss him.
I could talk specifics
forever, but I think it’s
worth taking a look at
the tone as a whole. In
the Stock Amoral Cor-
poration scenes the film
tries for that Alien style of
sci-fi unknown horror, but
fails spectacularly given
Drake’s cartoonish level
of evil. Frankly every time

The spectre of
