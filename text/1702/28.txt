I
t is a well-known
fact that when inter-
est rates are hiked,
investment banks
increase their profitability
due to their massive cash
holdings. Increasing the
interest rates directly
increases the yield on
the cash it holds, and the
proceeds go directly into
the income statement.
Furthermore, interest rate
hikes tend to occur in
environments where eco-
nomic growth is strong
and consumer and cor-
porate demand for loans
spikes. It is not surprising
that with the current strong
economic climate in the
USA, powered by the
tax cuts imposed by the
Trump administration in
addition to the recent rate
hike by the Fed, that bulge
bracket banks are starting
to reap the rewards. One
clear example of this is
Goldman Sachs. The bank
reported $6.28 earnings
per share (EPS) exceeding
the $5.38 analyst estimate,
with revenue exceeding
$8.4 billion estimate
coming in at $8.65 billion.
The business had bene-
fited strongly from high
demand for initial public
offerings (IPO), where
revenues for equities
underwriting had more
than doubled and fears
that fixed-income would
be hit were cushioned by
higher revenues from FX
and commodity trading.
David Solomon, CEO
who took over on 1 Oct,
is also broadening the
banking and trading client
base, finding growth in
smaller markets including
pushing into retail bank-
ing. Marcus, the new retail
banking arm of Goldman
Sachs, hit the UK high
streets earlier last month
and it has been announced
number of millionaires
generated record profits
of €15.4 billion for 111
private banks in western
Europe, with an annual
increase of 14.1%
according to McKinsey
the consultancy. UBS,
the main player globally
in private wealth
management, reported
that adjusted pre-tax
profits for its non-US
wealth operations rose
by 15%. Compare this to
BlackRock (the world’s
largest asset manager with
more than $6 trillion of
assets under management
based in the States)
whose shares plummeted
after its long-term net
flows- a measure of how
much money investors
are handing it, excluding
more short term volatile
cash management
vehicles- have hit a two
year low. BlackRock CEO
Larry Fink, laid the blame
on choppier financial
conditions, which have
caused investors to scale
back their exposure
to the market saying,
“Divergence in monetary
policy and macro and
geopolitical uncertainty
continues to impact
investor sentiment and
our financial markets,
leading clients to reduce
risk in their portfolios”.
However, BlackRock
is facing a seismic
longer-term shift in the
investment industry. The
global asset management
industry is facing
intensifying pressure from
cheap, index tracking
funds, which have drawn
hundreds of billions of
dollars since the financial
crisis.
I think, however, this
shows what all investors
that it will merge with
its investment manage-
ment unit. Solomon
claims the new division
will launch a “broader
wealth-management of-
fering combining Marcus’
digital capabilities with
the more established sales
channels and products
currently housed within
the investment manage-
ment division”.
On the other side of
the Atlantic, European
banks have also recorded
strong growth. Barclays
published third quarter
results with revenues
from equities and fixed-
income trading up by
almost a fifth. Jes Staley,
Barclays Chief Executive,
said “There has been a
comment that European
investment banks can’t
compete with the US,
and I would just point
out that for four quarters
in a row we have gained
market share”. The strong
performance of Barclay’s
trading desks compared
well with the larger banks
like Goldman and Morgan
Stanley, but its revenues
are still dwarfed by its US
rivals. However, it looks
like European private
banks are the highlight.

Investment banks relish in hawkish environment
are worried about at the
moment. The business
cycle peaking. Despite
strong growth results
there is an underlying
realisation that this is no
longer sustainable, and
that this is as good as it
gets. What is worrying
is that the debt load for
US corporations has
reached a record $6.3
trillion, with increasing
yields and what looks like
choppy waters ahead will
everyone be able to meet
their liabilities?
