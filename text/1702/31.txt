T
he first few
weeks of October
always seem to
have surprisingly
good weather to put the
new freshers at ease, but
eventually the first day of
rain comes.
Foryears,engineersand
scientists have been trying
to refine the Navier-Stokes
equations enough to be
able to predict weather
accurately. One thing that
should be kept in mind is
that there is nothing more
certain to cause miserable
weather than the looming
advent of the first cross
country race of the season.
This year as the leaves
turned brown (and wet)
Imperial’s fittest and
finest journeyed to North
London for the first in the
series of 5 races in the
London Cross Country
League.
The grass was definite-
ly slick, but the conditions
- unlike some races in
previous years - were far
from apocaliptic. The
true challenge of the day
facing the intrepid ICXC
runners was the famous
Parliament Hill, which
would need to be tackled
at least twice by all during
the course of the race.
After a hot debate over
the route to get to the race
start, the runners arrived
to Hampstead Heath in
dashing new spikes and
vests (for those who
managed to snag one
before they sold out!).
Following a brief
“Imperial
- with over
50 athletes
- fielded the
largest team of
any club”
warm-up and the tradi-
tional chanting on the
start line to drown out
the health and safety
instructions from the
race director, the 200-
strong crowd of runners
from across the capital’s
student population were
on their way.
St. Mary’s (a team
absolutely rammed with
international scholarship
talent) were on the right
of the start line, flanking
the strong showing from
Imperial who – with
over 50 athletes – fielded
the largest men’s and
women’s teams of any
club.
As is tradition at the
annual season opener, all
the colleges had selected
their respective “King of
the Hill” contenders.
This strange competi-
tion involves completely
ruining any prospect of
having a good race for
the victim as it involves
sprinting to get to the top
of the mammoth first hill
before anyone else.
Initially it looked like a
Bart’s runner would take
the crown, but in the end
they were no match for
Imperial’s heroic James
Millett. An 800m man
by trade, he used his
superior speed endurance
to overtake the fledgling
offerings from Bart’s and
Mary’s to bring back the
(metaphorical) King of the
Hill crown for Imperial.
The success for IC’s
band of merry runners
did not stop there. Niki
Faulkner, strong from the
gun, finished a clear 2nd
place behind “really fast”
steeplechaser from St.
Mary’s.
On the women’s side,
Georgia Curry made a
triumphant return to finish
an excellent 3rd, taking
home the bronze medal
just ahead of teammate
Kate Olding in 4th.
In terms of team perfor-
mances, in the women’s
competition, Imperial’s
A-team packed well to put
5 (Georgia Curry, Kate
Olding, Alix Vermeulen,
Liv Papaioannou and
Steph Hewitt) in the top 16
to place a close 2nd in the
team competition behind
Mary’s (who, unlike IC,
were not missing any star
athletes due to graduation
ceremonies).
Imperial’s B-team top
the B-league, finishing
in 4th overall ahead of
A-teams from King’s,
Reading, LSE, RVC,
RHUL, St. George’s, and
Bart’s. Following hot on
their heels, Imperial’s C-,
D-, and E-teams top their
respective leagues too.
In the men’s competi-
tion, Imperial have a bit
of work to do to catch
the 2 Mary’s teams and
UCL ahead of them in the
rest of the season as they
finished 4th team.
While only Niki (2nd)
broke into the top 20 on
this occasion, the depth of
the men’s squad is looking
encouraging for the
season ahead. Imperial A
placed all of their runners
in the top 35 with strong
runs from Daniel Garcia,
Fergus Johnson, Charlie
McFadzean and fresher
Lucas Kreifels.
Imperial’s B-team
finished 3rd in the
B-league, ahead of
A-teams from Bart’s,
LSE, and RVC. Imperial’s
C-team are also 3rd in
their league, with the
D-team 2nd (because St.
Mary’s only had 3 teams),
and the E-team top of the
E-league (out of 1).
The team looks forward
to getting some of their
“big hitters” competing in
the upcoming fixtures to
complement their admira-
ble strength-in-depth.
Naturally, the race was
followedbythemass-sam-
pling of all-manner of
baked goods made by
members, with some new
faces putting in early bids
for club “Baker of the
Year”.
The next race is widely
regarded as the flattest in
the LXCL calendar, and
takes place at Mitcham
Common on Halloween.
LXCL races are open
to all abilities (F-team
anyone?), so if you are in-
terested in coming along,
