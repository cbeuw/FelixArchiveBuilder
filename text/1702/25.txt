Five Decadent Hot Chocolates For Autumn
FOOD

T
his time of the
year is not only
perfect for flan-
nels, plaids and
woollen hats; hot choco-
late is a perfect drink for
transitioning into winter
season. In this article, I’ve
written about some of the
most decadent hot choco-
lates I’ve had in London.
Choccywoccydoodah
Choccywoccydoodah
is definitely one of the
most quirky boutiques
I’ve been in. The fiery-red
walls and the mismatched
furniture, coupled with
the vibrancy of Carnaby
Street, adds to the whole
experience. Located in
Soho, the boutique shop
has an array of chocolates
and cakes.
If you like your hot
chocolate with a side of
novelty, head to Soho
where your favourite cozy
drink comes in three vari-
eties – white, milk & dark
– and the bottom third
of the cup is pure melted
chocolate. The menu has
a wide range of items, and
the prices are decent.
The Chin Chin Labs
Chin Chin does not
mess around when it
comes to decadent hot
chocolate. The ice cream
parlour has branches in
Soho and Camden. If you
happen to find yourself
in Camden, then visiting
this trusty parlour is must.
Drinking hot chocolate
with the veggie-marsh-
mallow fluff while
walking in vinyl stores
and snapping silly photos
with friends makes for an
amazing weekend.
The venue is also
known for its unique ice
cream flavours, there is
a lot of variety and the
prices are quite student
friendly!
Peggy Porsche Cakes
Ltd
It is vital that you bring
your camera to this whim-
sical pastel café - the pink
and white colour scheme
along with the pink-flow-
ery façade makes the
place one of the most
Instagrammable places in
London.
The bakery is popular
for its gorgeous cakes,
cupcakes and biscuits.
It’s a spot your taste buds
shouldn’t miss out on
with its extensive range
of baked goods! To get
spooky for Halloween,
they have a pink skull
(full of flowers) outside
their window - how satis-
fyingly pastel-grunge, am
I right? .
Found on Ebury Street,
only a walk away from
Sloane Sqaure, Peggy
Porschen Parlour makes
for a great hot chocolate
date! If you go there
around 7PM, you might
have to wait for an hour,
but you could easily get a
place before their closing
time (which is 8:30 P.M.).
There is always a long
queue outside the parlour
so it is advisable to go
at an off-peak time or be
prepared for *a lot* of
waiting.
I recommend having
hot chocolate with mini
marshmallows and the
raspberry and lime dry
cake - both of the these
are awfully delicious! The
place is a bit pricey but
the lovely food makes up
for it!
The Peckham
Pelican
You can easily hang
out all day at the Pelican;
a cosy and beloved
gastropub/arts venue in
Peckham. With a unique
spin on hot chocolate, this
place is something you
must not miss out on.
Their thick and rich
hot chocolate is a local
favourite and pairs well
with any of their delicious
baked goods. When you
order hot chocolate, you
will get a mug literally
dripping in flavour and
nothing will ever taste as
good again. Located in
Peckham, when you visit
the place, you won’t be
able to resist checking out
other chocolate-y stuff.
Jaz and Jul’s
Jaz and Jul’s has a
killer range of hot choco-
late options. Having their
“Raspberry Dream Hot
Chocolate” was basically
like a warm hug!
When you visit them
at Broadway Market,
have a look at their hot
chocolate options - they
have everything from a
classic hot chocolate to a
masala and chai infused
concoction.
If you happen to be free
on a rainy weekend, you
might have to pop in and
check out their scrump-
tious Weekend Chocolate
Brunch. Did we mention
it’s bottomless drinks?
Prosecco, here we come!
Their fantastic prices
and the lively ambience
theme going on really
makes the whole experi-
ence amazing!
As the temperatures have started to drop, what better way to spend frosty nights than by wearing fuzzy sweaters
& having a hot cup of cocoa, ‘cause baby it’s cold outside…
