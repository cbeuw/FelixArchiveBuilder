At this point, you’re
probably tired of
hearing, seeing, listen-
ing to and arguing about
feminism. I’m not too
big of a fan of the word
either so please don’t go
ballistic just yet. Read
on, try to keep an open
mind, which I know
is crazy hard, but how
’bout we try for just one
sec?
Things are better for
women now. I mean,
of course they are, any
woman can walk to
the bank and open an
account, any woman
can walk up to a uni-
versity’s admissions
and apply... I could go
on and on. However,
I’d first like to make
sure we’re all on the
same page: I’m talking
from limited experience
as a white woman in
Western Europe. I don’t
pretend to know about
anyone else in any other
position. This doesn’t
make what I have to say
any less relevant, but it
makes it my own: I just
have a thought to share.
We keep letting anger
get in the way of these
important discussions,
too concerned about
how we get personally
offended by what people
have to say instead of re-
membering we all have
opinions, right or wrong
as we may consider them
to be. It’s tiring to want
to explain something to
someone and having to
yell to make yourself
heard, it’s tiring to focus
on the bad and forget the
good, and it’s tiring to
focus on the good and
remember the bad.
I’m writing this down
because I knew if I tried
saying this out loud,
I would probably let
myself get angry and
completely ruin my
point. This way, I know
where I’m headed.
I’m going to tell you a
true story. This summer,
my sixteen-year-old
brother told me with
disappointment, and
some sadness too, that
he didn’t understand
the women’s rights
movement. He told me
he felt a bit disheartened
that it was all about
equal rights but not
equal responsibilities.
He said he had a hard
time understanding the
movement when every
time he looked at the
truth, he was faced with
hatred for being a man
or the veil of politically
correct limitations that
has come to surround
most big social chal-
lenges. I was sad to hear
him say that, but also
proud to see that he had
been able to, calmly
and rationally, give
voice to the opinions
a lot of people, women
included, hold.
He was factual, he
was calm, he was also
open-minded. When I
told him he was mostly
thinking of what people
like to refer to as
”femi-nazis’, he kind
of agreed. I told him
the ’real’, ’original’
feminists wanted to
have opportunities and
choices just like guys
did. I told him I was a
feminist, and to me that
meant being allowed to
go out at night without
being scared, sitting
wherever I want on
the bus without being
subjected to lecherous
stares, walking into any
university (humanities
and science alike) and
seeing fifty-fifty ratios.
It also means looking
at the top earners and
seeing as many girls as
dudes and not having to
choose between career
and kids. Men never
have to, they never
even consider that pos-
sibility! I have nothing
against men, particu-
larly shirtless ones. Oh
wait... How does that
feel? But... I’m not here
to hate. I really want
to make a fair, rational
point, and if anger is
part of what sparked
this piece, it has no
place in its realization.
I was recently in one
of the most frustrating,
anger-inducing, dis-
appointing, saddening
arguments I have ever
been in. I was told by
privileged white young
men that inequality
between men and women
didn’t exist anymore.
I’m going to let that
sink in. Sunk in? They
said that. Now, I think
they meant they didn’t
understand shit about
women’s minds and
position in the world.
I’m not here to hate or
blame them. I’m here
to say that it’s sad that
conversation happened.
You see, they told me,
amongst other things,
that women made the
choice by themselves to
put family before career
because it ultimately
made them happier, that
it was ’natural’ and ’bio-
logical’ for women to be
closer and more involved
with their kids than men,
and that it was OK for
women only to make the
choice between children
and career. They told me
the feminist discourse of
equal rights and oppor-
tunities was backwards,
overturned, antiquated.
I’m going to give you a
moment to let that sink
in too.
I’ll admit that sexism
is no longer an issue of
men against women per
se, and truth be told I
think equal rights do
- theoretically - exist.
Sexism is a matter of
society now, of precon-
ceived ideas that we,
young men and women,
impose on ourselves
for some reason. I said
One of the enduring symbols of feminis, Rosie the Riveter// Flickr
that. Those two replied
with something similar
to, “society? That’s just
bullshit excuses to fuel
bullshit causes.” Ain’t
that bullshit? It’s like an
old Dove advert that my
friend pointed out: kids
of both genders were
asked to run like a girl:
the eight-year-olds all
ran the same, and four-
teen-year olds ran like
constipated dodos.
I swear to you all
those guys assured me
it was true girls ran
weird. I don’t know if
they thought that maybe
I just wanted to run their
faces through a wall
at that point? Wait. I
promised no hate. Much
less violence.
This actually brings
me to my last point:
biology. So yes, there
is a biological factor
to the whole male-fe-
male dynamic. This is
Imperial, and while we
love making fun of our
bio friends, we do rec-
ognise their existence.
Guys buffing up at
ethos, girls dieting, guys
dieting, girls buffing
up at ethos, we do it all
to be more attractive.
That’s true: we biologi-
cally want to reproduce.
Our generation likes
referring to it as ’being
horny,’ but we’re smart,
evolved creatures too,
who can control primal
biological needs with
this mysterious thing
called reason (also
referred to as common
sense, education or
normalcy). I was
angry, it didn’t mean I
punched anyone, I was
sad and disappointed, it
didn’t mean I cried or
shouted. The same way
that just because you
like someone you don’t
have sex in the middle
of the freaking hallway.
The same way that just
because you ’think’
it is manlier to be the
provider doesn’t mean
you’re emasculated by
having a successful
wife! I mean, watch the
Intern! Anything wrong
with a stay at home dad?
Let’s speak the truth,
boys and girls, we’re
all at fault here! We
don’t have to be sheep.
But I mean feel free to
wrap yourself in curly
white wool and move to
a field of grass and do
what all the others do.
Well... What the fuck.
We can do better. It’s not
even about rights, re-
sponsibilities, choices,
freedoms, whatever.
It’s about respect. For
yourself, for others,
those who are like and
unlike you, those who
came before and fought
for change, those who
come now and fight
for change, those who
will come to fight for
change. Because things
are never fine, they
never will be. But that
doesn’t mean we stop
making them better, and
a little less bad.
