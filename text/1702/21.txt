Pinter Two: a masterpiece of dialogue and discomfort
Ned Summers
Arts Writer
I
f you didn’t know
that you were at
The Harold Pinter
Theatre to see ‘Pinter
Two’, a double bill of
Harold Pinter one-scene
plays, the monolithic
stage curtain resembling
a tombstone for PINTER
would certainly inform
you of that fact. With
this introduction, this
staging of The Lover and
The Collection throws
itself emphatically into
everything for which
Pinter is known best. It is
entirely bizarre, uncom-
fortable and filled with
silences.
It is clear why these two
plays have been chosen to
be performed together.
Both are wonderful, un-
settling examples of the
frailty of reality, particu-
larly within interpersonal
relationships.
The Lover opens with
a husband asking his
wife with only upbeat
intrigue, ‘Is your lover
coming today?’. Through
its twists and pauses, the
play delicately paints a
portrait of the equilib-
rium of roles between a
couple. The bright pink
set, with flush doors, a
fold-down bar and an art
deco sunburst clock, feels
eerily impersonal; the
role of costume further
stands out in the space.
The stage curtain remains
half-closed, leaving it
feeling like a sitcom on
a screen but without the
canned laughter, just a
little disquieting.
The couple played by
Macmillan and Squires
make for an equally un-
comfortable centrepiece
of the performance. As
the single act develops,
the depth of unexpressed
tension existing between
these two characters
becomes clear, and as it
comes to a climax, with
their increasingly manic
attempts through stilted
pauses to find stability,
it is difficult not to shift
a little uncomfortably
in your seat through the
laughter.
Still ruminating over
unsettling questions
after the interval, we are
projected into a classy,
posh London; two houses,
one in Belgravia, one
in Chelsea, coexist on
the stage with only one
connection point: a black
rotary phone. Communi-
cation, or more precisely
incommunicability, is
the underpinning theme
in The Collection. An
affair, a woman’s pride,
a hotel room, sexuality,
and boredom are the in-
gredients of this explosive
story, whose captivating
narration, witty humour,
and continuous innuendos
successfully analyse
the intricacy of human
relations. Written in 1962,
this play remains scarily
relevant today. No true
feeling is ever explicitly
expressed, and characters
regularly refuse to state
the crude reality of facts.
What results is a hilarious
comedy of errors. Unlike
The Lover, the dialogue
here is often as playful and
energetic as it is witty, and
David Suchet and Russell
Tovey are outstanding as
they join Macmillan and
Squires for a four-person
act.
The Collection, though
just as full of pauses as
The Lover, also has its fair
share of longer speeches,
and Suchet’s silk-robed
Harry hurls lines with
vivacity. Suchet shows
extraordinary control of
diction, and, at the same
time, showcases Pinter’s
ability as writer. Through-
out the performance,
this character’s speeches
are mesmerising and

One of the two parts kicking off the Pinter at the Pinter season artfully displays everything that Pinter did so well.
between these characters
is smaller than between
Suchet and Tovey, and
the choice to ignore that
is exploited to great
effect), the play revolves
around those impacted by
Bill’s carelessness. Tovey
stretches each action to its
maximum, with perfect
awareness of his physical
presence. The end result is
a play dripping, in every
aspect, with overt and
covert eroticism.
The ‘Pinter at the
Pinter’ is more than a
commemorative season
of one-act plays; it is a
unique opportunity to
delve into the fascinating
mind of this beloved
playwright. Starting now
until February, the theatre
hosts seven ‘parts’ or
different shows, covering
a total of 19 of Pinter’s
plays, all performed by
undoubtedly talented and
well-known actors. The
quality of direction and
the creative team meet
that of the cast. The Jamie
Lloyd Company, thanks
to the actors’ personal
twists and liberties, does
complex. On the other
hand, Harry’s housemate
Bill, played by Tovey,
is young, quippy and
short. Caught somewhere
between an adolescent
pushing boundaries and
an adult fully aware of
his allure (in the original
script, the age gap
a distinguished job, doing
justice to the complicat-
ed analysis which the
London writer carried out
throughout his work. In
Pinter Two we see how a
high-level script is com-
plemented by incredible
technical work: from the
usage of lighting in The
Collection to create levels
on stage, to that pink set,
to the prop choices, these
details play a fundamen-
tal role in both stories.
An honourable mention
has to go to the director
Jamie Lloyd himself for
his skill in preserving
and, many times, high-
lighting the scenic details
so dear to Harold Pinter.
As expected, the cast is
nothing less than excep-
tional: they are able to
convey emotions in such
a unique and passionate
way that it’s impossible to
remain unmoved by their
characters. Our advice:
run to the Harold Pinter
Theatre and grab a seat,
you won’t be let down by
this sensational show!
