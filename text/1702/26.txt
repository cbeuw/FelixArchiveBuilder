Halloween
right around
the corner,
there’s always plenty of
scares including: course-
work deadlines, peer
pressure and our very own
Horror game recommen-
dations! We thought we’d
give you a fright this Felix
issues with our personal
selection of horror games
old and new, that you
can enjoy this upcoming
Halloween. So here’s our
list:
Doki Doki Literature

Let’s get two things
out there. First of all, this
game is absolutely free.
Incentivised yet? The
second point is that this
game is short. It should
not take you more than
5 hours to complete, and
that’s including the time
it would take to get the
‘good’ ending.
From the looks of it,
this game looks like a
colorful visual novel with
pretty 2D girls. You let
down your defences and
play what seems to be an
innocent dating simulator.
But, when you least expect
it, the game does a 180
and throws in something
which takes you com-
pletely by surprise. From
that point on, the game
shows its true colours and
things become more weird
and distorted as you keep
on playing.
A lot of classic horror
relies on shock and
scare tactics, preying on
people’s fight or flight
“TL;DR

you learn how
to mow down a
super powered
zombie horde”
will turn for the weird.
Dead Space 1 & 2
You’d think that this
game sounds horrifying,
exploding babies, cultists,
horrifically messed up
corpses, and a intention-
ally limited number of
resources. But there’s a
quiet power behind this
lovecraftian simulation of
black friday’s aftermath.
A sense of satisfaction
that can be found in
exacting vengeance upon
jump scaring monsters,
as you stomp on their
crawling bodies, having
tactically dismembered
them and used telekinesis
to ensure that the eldritch
horror stays down. None
of these give you the exact
power fantasy you get in
many sandbox games, but
it does deliver a fantastic
sense of survival.
You faced a threat, you
were afraid, you had no
means of beating it and all
you could do was crawl
away in terror. But what
was once prey, has now
become a badass engineer;
complete with a huge
arsenal of weapons and
enough telekinetic power
to make professor Xavier
envious. By the end of the
game you’re pretty much
a walking apocalypse,
making the undead wish
they stayed dead.

Alien Isolation
It’s behind me. Those
three words are what it
feelsliketoplaythisgame,
once you meet the Xeno-
morph there are few so
called “safe zones”. Even
more so with practically
everything wants to kill
you as if they witnessed
you kill their dog, in a
John Wick rage you will
have androids, humans
and xenomorphs hunting
you down. Androids
and humans may be a
hassle, but Xenomorphs
... nothing even comes
remotely close to the
sheer terror this creature,
and I do mean creature not
enemy or program, gener-
ates. Everything you do
has a grave consequence:
to draw it away? It learns
to recognise distractions
and it traces them to you!
In what seems to a game
of you against a hyper
intelligent military AI.
If you truly want to feel
like you are in a Alien
film, then by all means,
this game will leave you
dreading the overwhelm-
ing difference in league
that lies between you,
and the stealthy behemoth
that stalks you. Never has
the Bear Grylls phrase
“Survive, Overcome,
Adapt” been more suitable
for a video game.
Writer’s Note- Also
you play as an engineer.
Why is every horror game
protagonist an engineer
you ask? No idea, but they
survive, and that’s why I
chose engineering.
Resident Evil 7
Consider yourself
one of the family, in
this extremely horrible
simulator of meeting
your SO’s parents as you
find yourself in a decrepit
house in Dulvey, Lou-
isiana running for your
life from wolverine style
regenerating serial killers
and not to forget Zombies;
this is a resident evil game
after all ;) . Returning to
its original true horror
roots, this installment in
the resident evil series
does not disappoint, with
it easily being the scariest
game in the series due to
its close quarter nature
setting as well as its spec-
tacular stealth and running
sequences.
Armed with handguns,
shotguns, flamethrowers
and explosives you pretty
much macgyver weapons
together in a more horror
intense version of dead
rising, as you scrounge
for anything that you
can get your hands on.
All in all, just like the
regenerative abilities of
the monsters that dwell
in the household, you’ll
find that Resident Evil 7’s
extremely tense atmos-
phere doesn’t stay down
for long . From its creepy
soundtrack to its in depth
story, you’ll find yourself
constantly on the edge of
your seat as you attempt
to unravel the mystery
that is the Baker family.

You try to find out
where it is, using the
scanner? It can hear you
scanning. You try to wait
it out in a hiding place? Go
ahead, wait too long, it’ll
still hunt you down. Use
weapons and distractions

instinct. In this game, you
see and experience dif-
ferent things which make
you uneasy and put you
on the edge. The game
is brilliantly designed to
achieve this effect with
visual and audio distor-
tions as well as clever
fourth wall breaking here
and there. You literally
need to reinstall the game
to play it again.
If you want something
short, free and unique, this
is the game to play this
Halloween. The trigger

may seem odd and out
of place, but believe me,
things will turn when you
least expect it, and they
