“Although
public
environmental
awareness
has improved,
the lack of
genuine action
is alarming”
T
he publication of
Rachel Carson’s
Silent Spring
back in 1962
launched the international
environmental movement;
one can only wonder what
book she would come up
with if she were alive to
witness the present devel-
oping world.
Thankfully, her life’s
work inspired a generation
of staunch environmental-
ists around the world over
the next few decades. Yet
in a world where politics,
celebrities and other
matters dominate the
news and social media,
renowned environmental-
ists and their efforts are
neither attractive nor of-
fensive enough to garner
public attention.
This is also the case
with Malaysia, my native
country, blessed with
tropical biodiversity and
ample natural resources
but under threat from
continuing urban devel-
opment. Although public
environmental aware-
ness has significantly
improved in the country,
the lack of genuine action
and individual initiatives
to address the situation is
alarming. The few, inef-
fective, individual efforts
to tackle environmental
issues do not mask the
general “selfishness”
regarding the issue, points
out Gurmit Singh K.S., a
prominent Malaysian en-
vironmentalist and social
activist.
It was World Environ-
ment Day on June 6, 1979,
when he donned a gas
mask and raced a car with
his bicycle for 12 miles
across Kuala Lumpur to
highlight air pollution and
traffic problems in the
Malaysian capital. Nearly
40 years later, the photo-
graph of him on his bike
with the gas mask became
his most iconic photo and
eventually the cover for
his memoir, Memoirs of a
Malaysian Eco-Activist.
The book is obviously
unlike Carson’s Silent
Spring, which is focused
on environmental science.
Rather, it is an honest
account of Gurmit’s
life and journey as an
environmental and social
activist. While it is a short,
straight-to-the-point
account of his life, the
message he tries to deliver
extends far beyond envi-
ronmentalism. He took
almost five years to finish
the manuscript amid his
busy schedules, constant-
ly dogged by concerns
that nobody would want
to read such unexciting
subjects. He feared that
the average individual
would turn indifferent
once the word “environ-
ment” is expressed.
He tells his tale from
the moment he was
born in 1942 to Punjabi
parents in Penang Island,
during World War II when
the Japanese invaded
Malaysia (then Malaya).
“I never really picked
up Punjabi as a language.”
He recalls during an inter-
view in 2009, regarding
his roots. “If you want to
believe in the importance
of your mother tongue,
fine – but I don’t feel
deculturalised. In fact, I
resent being reminded that
I’m Indian, or Punjabi.
People should be dealt
with as individuals.”
During his school days,
he was an active scout and
frequently went out with
his friends on bicycles to
discover new places in
the environment. From a
young age he was taught
by his mother not to waste
by recycling cloth flour
bags into bedsheets.
Initially an electrical
engineer by profession,
he graduated from the
University of Malaya in
1970 after encountering
a few impediments due
to his zealous activism
in university affairs. By
the time the Malaysian
government enacted the

Malaysian eco-activist Gurmit Singh K.S. // ASEAN Affairs
environmental and social activism in Malaysia
“With a
population
of 32 million,
it takes
tremendous
collective
effort to
produce
results”
“This is
a sincere
account from
one who
witnessed
his country’s
march towards
industria-
lisation”
Environmental Quality
Act in 1974, Gurmit had
met people from various
scientific backgrounds
during his job at the
Rubber Research Institute
and was ultimately drawn
to environmental affairs.
That was also the year
he founded his first NGO
– Environmental Protec-
tion Society, Malaysia
(EPSM), from which he
officially began his envi-
ronmental activism career
and never looked back.
About 10 years later in
1985, he would establish
another NGO – Centre
for Environment, Tech-
nology and Development,
Malaysia (CETDEM)
– which he chairs to this
day. CETDEM’s slogan,
‘Always Promoting Sus-
tainable Development’,
sums up their ambitious
but challenging objectives
– to improve environ-
mental quality through
appropriate use of tech-
nology and sustainable
development.
His decorated CV
speaks for itself; of the
many awards he has
received, notable ones
include the 2013 MDG
7: Ensure Environmental
Sustainability Award from
United Nations Malaysia,
the Green CatalystsAward
in 2015, and most recently
the 2018 Merdeka (Inde-
pendence) Award in the
environment category.
His outspokenness
about environmental
and social causes led to
a turbulent relationship
with the authorities;
nonetheless he maintains
his humility outside his
field of work. I had the
pleasure of attending one
of his speeches during a
CETDEM public forum
in 2015, and although we
had only a brief exchange
of words, he came across
as a relaxed and caring
individual.
What about the current
situation in Malaysia?
Environmental NGOs are
on the rise, awareness
campaigns are overflow-
ing, and countless projects
are being introduced to
address the unending
issues. Yet the results are
still to be seen. He reiter-
ates that Malaysians are
very good at starting new
things but are dreadful at
maintenance. Perhaps he
is also pointing out the
“one-off” projects and
practices regarding the
environment that have
surfaced in the past.
“Everyone thinks
planting trees is great. But
they forget that trees have
to be maintained.” He said
during his book launch in
2017. “I now tell people
that ‘I will support your
effort if you check every
six months to see if your
trees are alive’”.
With a population
of 32 million, it takes
tremendous and dedi-
cated collective effort
to produce results on
improving environmental
matters. Beneath the cel-
ebrated multiculturalism,
biodiversity and great
food, there are political
scandals, discriminations
and selfishness. How are
we supposed to focus on
maintaining individual
environmental respon-
sibilities with so many
other distractions playing
behind the scenes?
“Too many people are
selfish. But we must look
beyond ourselves. And
we must all take action
to solve environmental
problems, because gov-
ernments alone cannot do
it. The power is with the
people.”
On social issues, he
hopes “that a day will
come when we have real
multiculturalism, when
you don’t have to specify
your ‘race’ and ‘religion’
in a government form.”
Now 75, he is still
visible on the activism
front and is a man of his
word – living a life with
minimal ecological foot-
print. He resides with his
wife, Tan Siew Luang, an
organic-farming advocate,
in a house equipped with
solar panels, a rainwater
harvesting system, a
composting site and
recycling spots. Today,
with heavy traffic obstruc-
tions a trademark of the
capital, he owns no car
and depends on public
transportation, walking
and cycling as modes of
travel. Continuing what
he started nearly 40 years
ago, this is clearly some-
thing close to his heart. Of
course, he doesn’t expect
everyone to live exactly
like he does.
“We can all make a dif-
ference in however small a
way. Don’t buy too much
and refrain from buying
unnecessary things, bring
your own bags when you
go shopping and so on.
People always tell us they
admire us, but they do not
do anything on their part
to save the environment.”
Memoirs of a Malay-
sian Eco-Activist was
published almost a year
ago in April 2017, and
though concise, the core
message is still significant
for readers: Malaysia
needs to overcome self-
ishness and tackle envi-
ronmental problems with
determination. Whether
you are a fledgling envi-
ronmentalist or someone
with an ambition to better
the world, this book is
a sincere account from
someone who witnessed
his country’s relentless
march towards industri-
alisation, and how his
resolute passion shaped
his journey.
