A S T H E conflict between t h e U n i v e r s i t y
authorities and the Students' Union at
Lancaster c r y s t a l l i s e s into i t s wider
perspective which closely a l l i e s itself
with the " i r r e s i s t i b l e force meeting an
immovable o b j e c t " paradox, it becomes
worthwhile to examine the current issues
which are now being tossed from hand to
hand like grenades and relate to their
a s s o c i a t i o n with many of the h i s t o r i c a l
aspects of the University and the growth
of the Union there .
"The seeds of this conflict were sown
in the past and the almost traditional
lack of detente."
The seeds of this conflict were sown
in the past and the almost traditional
lack of detente between the University
and the Union ensured that those seeds
matured into a serious conflict of ideas.
F i r s t let us look a t the University
itself. Only circumstantial evidence exists
which supports the view that " B i g
B u s i n e s s " has a d e c i s i v e say in the way
the University is run, v i z . , the proliferation
of business departments which are now to
be merged into a huge block paid for by
private enterprise. T h i s i s hardly con-
c l u s i v e proof. But consider further that
the claim of " a l l the academic staff are
now y e s - m e n " does appear to have some
kind of basis in the fact that in 1972
several outspoken junior academics were
sacked from the E n g l i s h Department; the
Biology Department used to have three
members of A S T M S â€” it now has none;
the head of the Sociology Department,
John Wakeford (wtio held radical v i e w s ) ,
was replaced by someone less controver-
s i a l . T h e latter event provoked a great
deal of letter writing (to no avail) but no
militancy .
"...(the University's Vice-Chancellor)
has remained adamant in his refusal to
recognise the Lancaster Union's
elected leadership."
It i s at this point that the student left-
wing w i l l stand up a n d s a y that this
" e m a s c u l a t i o n of the academic staff into
y e s - m e n " was a necessary condition for
financial investment by business interests
who d i d not want any kind of controversy
to interfere with what they were doing.
But again, the evidence i s i n c o n c l u s i v e .
Now let u s consider the development
of the Students' Union at Lancaster.
Originally there e x i s t e d a peculiar
federal system of Junior Common Rooms
w h i c h elected their own representatives
to s i t on the sovereign body, the Student
Representative C o u n c i l which took a l l the
important decisions on behalf of the
U n i o n ' s membership. Federation meetings
(ie meetings which were open to a l l
students) had no power and were only
able effectively to recommend decisions
to the S R C . In other words, the Council
had all the powers (and more) that UGM's
currently have.
This anachronistic representational
democracy inevitably gave way to direct
democracy with campus-wide ballots and
the creation of a Union Executive which
is mandated by Union General Meetings.
This move w a s extremely significant
since it introduced the concept of
collective responsibility.
It was the beginning of the road lead-
ing to the current conflict when C h a r l e s
Carter, the U n i v e r s i t y ' s V i c e - C h a n c e l lor
(the equivalent of I C ' s Rector) stated
that he found the changes in the U n i o n ' s ,
structure " t o t a l l y u n a c c e p t a b l e " . H a v i n g
adopted such an uncompromising attitude,
he has remained adamant in h i s refusal to
recognise the Lancaster U n i o n ' s elected
leadership. It is this that I personally s e e
as the tap root of the current situation.
"Yet all the current signs ...seem to
indicate that the University is deter-
mined to 'settle this nonsense once and
for all' on their own terms."
The rest of the story has been essentially
a series of provocations and escalations
for which neither s i d e have been altogether
blamelees.
T h i s kind of breakdown in communica-
tion, this lack of detente responsible for
a large number of disputes developing into
strikes during the early days of organised
trade u n i o n i s m . Confrontations were
consistently exacerbatory whilst talks
and negotiations always proved to be the
first step to a s o l u t i o n . Y e t a l I the current
signs associated with the Lancaster
dispute seem to indicate that the University
is determinded to "settle this nonsense
once and for all" on their own terms.
So let us now examine just what the
" n o n s e n s e " i s .
A student at Cartmal College (Lancaster
has an inter-collegiate system),following
the U n i o n ' s policy went on rent strike in
opposition to the Government's cuts in
Educational expenditure. H e a l s o applied
for a financial hardship grant. H e w a s
refused one because he was on rent s t r i k e .
A n E G M w a s c a l l e d to d i s c u s s the matter
and as a result there followed a n occupa-
tion of the University administration
b u i l d i n g . T h e policy was twice re-affirmed
by U G M ' s attended by over 1300 students
and participated in by several hundreds
throughout its twelve-day period.
"Thus wehave the pattern of escalation:
a series of mutual provocations..."
After the eviction by the P o l i c e , thirty-
three students (including the entire union
executive) were singled out for d i s c i p l i n a r y
action to be dealt with by a s p e c i a l tribunal.
Such a tribunal could only be s e t up by a
meeting of the University Senate which duly
met. There does appear to be some evidence
to support the view that the Senate meeting
was in fact unconstitutional because the
student representatives were barred from

attending. T h e students therefore felt
entitled to label the tribunal a "kangaroo
c o u r t " ; the Union refused to recognise the
tribunal and a s a result, the matter appeared
to be concluded with a heavy batch of
explusions, again including the entire union
executive.
"The solution is deceptively simple:
One goes right back to the tap root, the
breakdown in communications, the lack
of detente."
Thus we have the pattern of escalation:
a series of mutual provocations: (1) the
Union goes on rent strike, thus provoking
the U n i v e r s i t y ; (ii) the University refuses
a student a hardship grant, thus provoking
the Union; ( i i i ) the Union decides on a n
occupation, thus provoking the University;
(iv) the University gets the P o l i c e to evict
the students and then sets up a "kangaroo
c o u r t " , thus provoking the U n i o n ; (v) the
Union retaliates by refusing to recognise
the authority of the tribunal, thus provoking
the University; (vi) the University finally
expels some students, thus provoking the
Union. G o d , what a total mess! Where does
one go from there? The solution is decep-
tively simple: One goes right back to the
tap root, the breakdown in communications,
the lack of detente.
The argument now impinges itself
squarely on V i c e - C h a n c e l lor Charles
Carter and h i s hitherto uncompromising
attitude in refusing to recognise the U n i o n ' s
elected leadership.The only truly purposeful
solution to the Lancaster dispute can be a
diplomatic o n e . A crushing defeat or a
stunning victory for'either side w i l l set an
incredibly dangerous precedent.
"Indeed, the Governors at Lancaster
may eventually determine that (the
Vice-Chancellor's) removal would be
the only alternative to closing the
University."
If the students at Lancaster decide that
their V C i s taking a bit too much advice
from the business interests which are
present on the campus, then the Union
might conceivably s e e a route to s u c c e s s
by directing a campaign not against the
University authorities, but against the
overt prejudices of a much more vulnerable
target: Charles C a r t e r . Indeed the Governors
at Lancaster may eventually determine that
his removal would be the only alternative
to c l o s i n g the U n i v e r s i t y . It's now up to
the Lancaster V C .

Now the question which this article a s k s
is: " C o u l d it happen h e r e ? " The answer in
my view i s : "Currently, no." A t present I C /
ICU relations serve a s an almost impeccable
model for other institutions of higher
education a s far a s detente goes. It is a
tribute to the individuals and personalities
involved that things have stayed that way
for s o long. But it remains a pity that such
an example cannot rub off on Lancaster.
