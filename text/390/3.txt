T H E A N N O U N C E M E N T of the level
of student maintenance grant for next
year is likely to be made any time w i t h i n
the next w e e k . There is a great deal of
speculation and anxiety, not only from
students but from College authorities as
w e l l . T h e rumour that the grant would go
up to £750 (a 24% rise) apparently sent a
number of V i c e - C h a n c e l l o r s and H a l l
Wardens reaching for their phones in
consternation, because such a level
would be clearly inadequate in meeting
the economic charges for hall rents and
catering that they w i s h to charge.
"The familiar cycle of the grant
being reduced in real value, the
increasing hardship caused by means
testing and discretionary awards and
other anomalies begins to repeat
itself." -
One thing is clear: the full c l a i m is
not going to be met, nor are theanomalies
going to be a b o l i s h e d . T h e familiar c y c l e
of the grant being reduced in real value,
ttje-Hncreasing hardship caused by means
testing and discretionary awards and
other anomalies begins to repeat i t s e l f .
It is dubious whether the increase w i l l
put us up t o a s i m i l a r level (in real terms,
as that of October 1 974; with the increases
in refectory prices a n d hall rents fore-
cast, an inexorably declining standard.of-
living for next s e s s i o n ' s students is
inevitable.
The recent activities of t h e A s s o c i a t i o n
of University Teachers shows that we
are not alone in this. The staggering
decline in university lecturers' real
incomes, both in absolute terms and in
comparison to C i v i l Service salaries is
a matter of grave concern to a l l of u s .
The fact that teachers are leaving the
universities for better-paid jobs points to
the probability of reduced staff-student
ratios (already affected by the d e c i s i o n
not to fill certain posts which fall vacant)
and a falling standard of education.
"What response will students and
lecturers give to this situation? The
answer is becoming more and more
clear: militancy and disruption."
What response w i l l students and
lecturers give to this situation? T h e
answer is becoming more and more clear
militancy and disruption. The policies of
the present Government are driving even
self-styled " m o d e r a t e s " to direct a c t i o n .
Witness the pledge of the Liberals elected
at Lancaster to maintain the campaign
in defence of the rent strike instigated
by the Left, and to c a l l for further
occupations if the University does not
budge. Witness the consistant U G M s of
1500 students or more at Warwich, c a l l h g
for maintenance of the occupation there;
in spite of the Left's misgivings, and in
spite of impending examinations. A d d to
that the new tone of the hitherto super-
moderate " p r o f e s s i o n a l " a s s o c i a t i o n ,
the A U T , now w i l l i n g to contemplate,
disrupt ing examinations.
It is c r u c i a l that this new wave of
militancy should be seen in context.
No-one seriously believes that an
economic c r i s i s w i l l be solved by cutting
bacK on educationa I expenditure . In fact,
when those cuts begin to bite into the
quality and standard of education, they
become counterproductive by reducing
the stock of s k i l l e d manpower which i s
e s s e n t i a l to B r i t a i n ' s economy. Many
people Tn education now recognise that
they are fighting to maintain standards;
from this point there c a n be no shrinking
because further cuts mean the destruction
of the whole s y s t e m .
"Comprehensive secondary education
iswell on its way to collapse through
lack of finance; other sectors, such
as adult education are not too far
behind."
Comprehensive secondary education
is w e l l on its way to collapse through
lack of finance; other sectors such as
adult education are not too far behind.
There is talk of a n anti-university lobby
in Government: this may w e l l be True
(though I am s c e p t i c a l ) . However, we c a n
only w i n the struggle for a decent educa-
tion system by uniting with a l l other
sectors; education a s a whole must be
argued for, and'fought for in every w a y ,
including direct a c t i o n .
"Women's inequality is fundamentally
a function of an unequal society, and
it is until our own social relatidns
are changed that women will cease
to occupy an inferior position ."
The visit of Germaine Greer to IC, at
the R C S U A n n u a l Dinner proved to be a n
enlightening one. I have never been a
great admirer of Dr Greer, not because I
am apposed to equality between sexes,
but because I believe that she has often
trivialfsed the entire question and failed
to link it to the cerftraI conflicts within
our society at the present time. Womerj's
inequality is fundamentally a"?unction of
an unequal society, and it is not.uniu our
own s o c i a l relations are changed that
women w i l l cease to occupy a n inferior
position.
Nevertheless, there are many aspects
of s o c i a l equality w h i c h c a n be fought
for, and these include equal pay, working
conditions and s o o n . The outstanding
Trevor Phillips
example at the present time is that of
the right of women to have abortions
performed.Dr Greer delineated the factors
involved eloquently and accurately and
I would not even attempt to reproduce her
exposition. But it is clear that the
proposels of James White, M P , would
drive many women back to the " b a c k -
s t r e e t " abortionists, and cause an
immense amount of suffering. Fundament-
a l l y , Mr White seeks to limit the right of
the'woHten to terminate her preganncy, o n v
flimsy and in places false ground's . It wilt
not stop abuses', it w i l l encourage them.
Mr W h i f e s dubious brand of morality
would drive us back into the pre - 1967.
days, in spite of the fact that the Lane"
Committee on A b u s e s of the 1967 A c t ,
(set up on the instigation of Mr White and
his friends) emphatically endorsed the
1967 A c t .
"...the proposals of James White,
MP, would drive many women backtt.o
the "back-street" abortionists, and
"cause an immense amount of suffer-
ino"
I would urge everyone to help in
defeating this regressive and appalling
piece of l e g i s l a t i o n , by signing the
petitions being circulated and writing to
your M P and the Select Committee.
The A G M on May 22nd sees the award

are theoretically the Union s highest
d i s t i n c t i o n , and are decided upon by the
President. Despite my disapproval of
such awards, I w i l l be giving out a
number, not just for hard work (or e l s e a
large number of people would qualify) but
for particular contributions made to the
life of the Union over the past year. I
would welcome written suggestions from
any member of the U n i o n .

Rock Flashbacks - Lifetime (Polydor)
On approaching an album featuring 4
c l a s s musicians with s o l i d pedigrees and
2 outstanding talents there is reason for
some anticipatory lip-smacking, w h i l s t
keeping in mind that 25% of the troops
comprise Mr computer-guitar himself.
Indeed, for sheer manic musical power
this quartet take a lot of beatinq.
initial impressions are not good a s
the leader " o n e w o r d " moves into the
eerie vocals and mindless cacophony of
" a famous b l u e s " . Extremely c l a s s y
rythmic backing to a l l the nonsense
provides glimmers of hope but Tony
Williams quality drumming is constantly
splintered by the extreme boorishness of
John M c L a u g h l i n ' s guitar work .Technique
for techniques sake is dull and he leaves
Williams and Larry Young on organ to
carry the songs along with anything
approaching conviction and d i r e c t i o n .
J a c k Bruce's bass remains largely i n -
audible — h e ' s light years from home
witl> these 1000-note-a-minute-or-die
m u s i c i a n s .
Most impressive piece on the album
is John Cothane's " B i g N i c k " a nice
fusion of brain power a n d immaculate
timing, followed by " V u e l t a A b a j o "
which although well deranged makes a
pleasant change in that there is at last a
discernible beat which a l l four musicians
try to adhere to a good example of
imaginations working along their own
lines within the framework of a strong
melody. Recommended only for deeply-
studious jazzers.
Jim Gilstrap: Swing Your Daddy
(Warner Bros.)
Old sounds are becoming increasingly
popular a s if the modern stuff has little
to say and this single typifies what record
companies seem to think i t ' s a l l about.
It's the wunkiest deal since the Urchies —
wimpish crooning dirge fronting some
moronic doo-wop support. C o u l d be a hit
in these days of cost-effective musak
barrages and s h a na na outbreaks. F o r
resilient listeners there's part 2 on the
other side.
