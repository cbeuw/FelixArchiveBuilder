T H E INCIDENT which occured at Silwood Park last
Friday (see page one) highlights the extreme vulner-
ability of the arrangement which existed between the Ban
organisers and the Warden of Silwood. It appears that
in the past, a certain amount of tact & discretion
sprinkled with luck saw the function through to Is finish.
But last Friday for a brief moment, luck was elsewhere
and the tact & discretion had, on the one side, been
stretched by the previous twelve hours hard grind in
setting the event up, and on the other, lost in the seams
of the casual attire.
When matters began to come adrift there were no
rules, regulations, strict understandings for anyone to
consult as a means of arbitration. Was the Country House
strictly and unequivocally booked, or did RCSU just
have the use of it? Maybe it is time the Warden of
Silwood clarified the matter.
Meanwhile, the cankerous destruction called " i l l -
feeling" seems to be demanding redress on behalf of
the Silwood students. But it is to Silwood's credit that
the hard-liners who are determined to "give RCS a kick
up the a — " at almost any cost are in a minority —
vengeful motivations never could quite be correlated to
mature attitudes.
Dick Cook, the Silwood Park Students Committee
Chairman, has made it clear that discussion and close
co-operation is now essential if this kind of thing is
to be avoided in future years. I'll say 'aye' to that -
and the sooner the better.

/ am out of a job-!) B a c k to
more serious things though;
after only two weeks or s o a s
the IF R e p , I w a s summonsed
to a meeting in the depths of
Queen E l i z a b e t h College, to be
told that homely, little U S K
was doomed to be swallowed
up into the impersonality (not
to mention crudeness) of
Catbums. Well really? How
can I follow that?
A s far a s IF is concerned,
it is quite a sore point . We
knew U S K . (If w e d i d n ' t , w e
should have!) We knew the
colleges w h i c h were part of
U S K (well, most of them...)
but C A T B U M S ? H o w many of
us feel that being part of a n
area which stretches out a s far
as Brunei and Middlesex P o l y ,
w i l l really d o us much good?
Unfortunately, a s a relatively
un important secretar ia I c o l lege,
w h i c h is only 200 strong, there
is not a lot w e c a n d o about
it! U S K (which for those w h o
haven't got the faintest idea
what I am t a l k i n g about, stands
for U n i v e r s i t y / U n i o n of South
Kensington) meant that our
college w a s invited to other
larger col leges' Ents functions.
I would like to know how many
people from South K e n a r e
going to make their way out to
the w i Ids of the West of London
for a Saturday night bop or
whatever, to take advantage of
the C A T B U M S plan. (And I
thought it w a s a w e l l known
fact that the larger an organis-
ation becomes, the more
inefficient it becomes too).
In fact, it seems that the
London Student Organisation,
to whom we owe the great
alteration, is only interested
in the p o l i t i c s of the matter
and then only s o that when they
decide that there is to be
trouble, a larger area is
involved.
But I think I have s a i d
enough (ie I have put my foot
right in it). Perhaps it is a good
job that U S K is being done
away w i t h , a s my p o l i t i c a l
views were not entirely i n
accordance with those required.
For example, the NUS and L S O
(not the London Symphony
Orchestra) c a l l e d for Students
"to work in the Labour
Movement Campaign"AGAINST
the Common Market, w h i c h I
think a s B i l i n g u a l Secretary-
B i r d s , we should be supporting.
A s to my redundancy on the
IF E x e c , I think I ' l l just have
to quietly busy myself with
paper/T-shirt s e l l i n g and hope
no one notices that I haven't a
great deal to do...!
Parking Problem (continued from page 1)
snap up the places in deference
to the students w h i l s t he was
attending to other d u t i e s . In
other words he was prepared to
f i l l the spare places with
known students rather than run
the r i s k of outsiders grabbing
them.
Countering that argument,
Jacqui Gerrard, the I C Union
H o n . Secretary felt that for the
warden to use his d e s c r e t i o n i n
certain c a s e s is fine, provided
that no official parking-permit
holder i s prevented from parking
and this is what has indeed
happened recently.
C l e a r l y the only true monitor
with which to guage this
situation is the number of
complaints from parking-permit
holders who are unable to park.
It these are no complaints, then
things are fine; i f n o t , then
something has to be done about
it.
Any students finding them-
selves in the position where
they hold an official parking
permit and yet are unable to
park in the area allocated
should contact the Hon.
Secretary (Int. 3915/2232)
immediate ly.
