Silwood Incident
R C S U N I O N ' S Country House B a l l held at Silwood P a r k , the
College F i e l d Station, last F r i d a y w a s marred by an unpleasant
incident which may, if tempers do not soon c o o l , have far-reaching
repercussions as regards the future of this annual event.
The incident occured when
some of the Silwood Park
students appeared in jeans'n
jumpers at what was a formal
dinner-jacket occasion a n d ,
without h a v i n g tickets,
attempted to buy drinks at the
bar . It was their contention
that since the bar is run strictly
as a private club and that any
extension applies to the club
and nto to the function for
which the extension was applied
for, then they, it seemed, were
entitled to buy drinks at the
bar.
It was R C S U ' s contention
that since the Silwood students
were without tickets and
improperly dressed, then they
had no right to be at the
function which had cost those
present £8 for a double ticket.
It is understood that the
students later left feeling very
disgruntled after mention was
made of s o m e ' h e a v i e s ' possibly
being c a l l e d upon to 'bounce'
them.
L e g a l l y , the situation is
confused and is best considered
in terms of other College
facilities . If the Country House
has the same status a s , for
example, the College B l o c k
J C R , then it is bookable and
whilst remaining a student area
it is at the d i s p o s a l of whoever
books the facility. If however,
the House has the status of,
say, the Union B a r , then w h i l s t
it is possible to hold a function
there, no student c a n be barred
from using that f a c i l i t y .
Whatever happens, it is
clear that the incident has
created a great deal of i l l -
feeling on both s i d e s . A lack
of communication and maybe
just one stray remark set the
scene for the incident. One c a n
only hope that the two sides
can get together and ratfc the
thing out . C l e a r l y , much greatei
liason and co-operation w i l l be
required in future years if the
Annual Silwood B a l l is '.» run
smoothly — and if, indeed, it is
to run at a 11.

Parking Problem
F O L L O W I N G C O M P L A I N T S that certain student motorists
possessing parking permits for the Southside area were unable to
park there, F E L D C decided to investigate the matter.
Over a period of five days,
the forty-odd parking places
in front of Southside were,
s t a t i s t i c a l l y checked to see
how many actually displayed
the official parking permit.
For the first four days
(Monday to Thursday) the
pattern c o n s i s t l y showed about
50% of the vehicles displaying
permits and 50% without. It
was after this time that the
College P a r k i n g Committee met
to d i s c u s s these very statistics
which had been gleaned and
concluded that the Parking
Warden would have to tighten
up on illegally parked c a r s .
That Friday no statistics were
taken, but the following Monday
showed a marked improvement
with less than 3 0 % of the
vehicles without a permit
(including two diplomatic cars
from the L i b y a n E m b a s s y no
l e s s ) .
When asked to comment John
Scene in RATT on Wednesday
R A T T (Room At The Top), t h e half-completed set of
Union Committee rooms at the top of Union building is in a
mess and no work has been d o n e on M since January, it was
recently revealed.
Contractual work began last
summer on R A T T to convert
the large draughty room into an
eminently more useful set of
committee rooms using part-
itions. T h e contracting firm,
Norwood Steel, apparently
stopped early this year and
nobody seems to know w h y . A t
the moment, building materials
are scattered a l l over one
section of the place; there are

holders who might want to use

doors have been hung very bad ly,
and other doors have yet to be

Union is " p e r t u r b e d " about a l l
this .
Over in College B l o c k , there
appears to be some confusion
as to whose responsibility it
is to ensure R A T T ' s com-
pletion, but the general feeling
is that the contractors, Norwood
Steel, have let us down very
badly. It appears that a week
last Wednesday, a spokesman
for the firm s a i d that he was
given to understand that the
job had been completed. That
person, is clearly in for a
surprise.
Tom Shearer, the C o l l e g e ' s
site superintendent, told F E L I X
that despite having a great
d e a l of work on at the moment
he intends to chase the matter
up fully.
