I t ana often been M i d that I.C. i s too far
from tha centra of London to be as wall known as i t
might. We, being members of I.C., tend to overlook the
fact that others have never even heard of i t . London i s
too large f o r anyone to know every part but one would
have thought that London Transport should kno* ua wall
enough to know that we exist i n South Kensington.
Yat what do we find on tha street maps
adorning the walla o- the Undargxound? Guilds and Mines
are marked as the Imperial Institute, R.C.S i s indicated
as part of the V i c t o r i a & Albert Museum and the Science
Vlusaum. Laasar placea i n The Strand and Sower Street
are indicated. .Vhy not I.C.?
There i s one obvious remedy - provide each
member of the union with a large red pencil but there
must be a way to rectify t h i s omission whioh would be
more satisfactory to a l l concerned.
Another caae f o r action of some sort or another
i s i n the matter o f preserving ourselves i n our journeys
up and down Exhibition Road. Comparatively few of us
can l i v e i n the hostel and many have to r i s k crossing
Cromwell Road and Thurlpe Place. Of l a t e , the tendency
of t r a f f i c to swing into these roads, from Exhibition
Road, without giving signals o f any kind, has increased.
There i s the alternative of using the subway
but no one should be forced to burrow beneath the ground
instead of enjoying the fresh (comparatively) a i r above.
The roada around I.C. are wide enough f o r the t r a f f i c to
travel reasonably quickly and s t i l l 6 -ive us a cnance to
cross the roads i n safety. Hence i t appears that the so
solution l i e s i n educating the motorists. There's scope
for someone here'.

present gym. One w i l l be known aa a s t a f f common
room, hut w i l l be a v a i l a b l e f o r r e c e p t i o n s , e t c . .
The present s t a f f common room w i l l be used as an
extension t o the k i t c h e n premises.
Two new f l o o r s w i l l be added. The concert

to be made i n t o one l a r g e room.
Another r e f e c t o r y w i l l occupy the 3rd

The working committee of the London area grants survey
(on which Sick Jaaaa, the Mines president, was represent-
ing I.C., i n the University Colleges section) decided to
apply f o r a hearing with L.C.C. and suggested a date early
i n May. Among the problems f o r discussion, those peculiar
to University Colleges were vacation courses and tha expenses
incurred therein.
This move was the result of the questionnaires sent
round several colleges. At I.C. only 571 out of about
1600 students completed questionnaires. This made i t
impossible to break the information down into courses, years,
parents' income etc. The following table shows the d i s t r i - '
bution of those co-operating.

H I D D E N T R E A S U R E
I t ' s funny how things f i n d t h e i r way to the
oddest of places. In the o l d lab. the other day, I
came across an o l d wooden case, i t s top locked with
a huge wooden padlock but the hinges gone, so that
i t opened from the other side instead. Inside was
a mass o f o l d papers, some pinned together, others
j u s t f l o a t i n g about. They turned out t o be the Union
Treasurer's records f o r about 1928-35. Too eager
to f e e l g u i l t y , I began to browse.
"Dear S i r " a l e t t e r ran, "We herewith return
your cheque f o r £8, as the account has already been
s e t t l e d by XXX. We hope you f i n d everything to be
i n order." A very o p t i m i s t i c hope, i t turned out.
The very next l e t t e r was from the Amateur Fen-
cing Assn., m i l d l y but f i r m l y reproving i n tone.
The season was w e l l advanced i t said, but the I.C.
Fencing Club had not yet paid i t s a f f i l i a t i o n fees.
Would the Hon. Sec. i n question take the necessary
steps. I can just see the Hon Trees, reminding the
Hon S e c , who would then approach the Hon. Treas.
o f f i c i a l l y and request mm, as the person i n charge
of the cash, to forward (the necessary fees on h i s
(the Hon. S e e ' s ) behalf, necessary adjustments to
the Club's account with the Union to be made i n due
course. This i s known as working through the proper
channels.
The Morphy. Dinner i n '29 was held on the 13th
March. I t s b i l l came to s- 6*7 guests h/- head,
O.7.8.0; wines and c i g a r s f o r guests £2.1.1; break-
ages £1.8.5. Things were cheap i n those days.
11 cars were "completely releathered" f o r only
£1.2.0. BUt then therewas a b i l l from an Eton inn,
charging the boat club I V - a head f o r bed and break-
f a s t . This was i n '29. Most have been a t e r r i f i c
place.
The l e t t e r that r e a l l y appealed to me, though,
was an humble request, addressed to the Hon. Treas.
Could she, the ICWA Treasurer t i m i d l y asked, "please
have the money a l l o t t e d by the Union to ICWA f o r
Session 1928-29, tfce amount being £5 ?" I hope
she got i t .
