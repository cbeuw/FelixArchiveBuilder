Dear Sir, ;
I would l i k e to ask when an o f f i c i a l announcement I s
to be mete about the forthcoming alterations to the Union
premises. These building a c t i v i t i e s w i l l probably affect
more maer-graduates than the larger scale alterations t o
be made to the College blocks.
Surely a comer of tho p a l l of secrecy can be l i f t e d
to throw some l i g h t on t h i s matter by a few words from the
powers that be.
Already too much important news finds i t s way around
the College by rumour; so that i f we are going to lose the
roof of the Gym t h i s term, l e t us at least know when.
Yours f a i t h f u l l y ,
J.S. Seeley.
KDITOR'S NOTE: FELIX has been endeavouring to publish news
about the reconstruction f o r a very long time. As f a r
back as February we announced that "A description of the new
buildings w i l l appear i n FELIX i n the very near future"
but publication was delayed because the licence f o r the work
'had not then been granted.
At present tenders are being invited f o r the work but
the architects plans, i n the possession of the administra-
tion department, are thought to be too misleading f o r
FELIX to use. The Clerk to the Governors i s now trying to
arrange for a diagram of the layout of the new building Cor
Inclusion In the next FELIX. Meanwhile, a summary o f
the news now c i r c u l a t i n g around the union, i s gimen
elsewhere in t h i s issue.
Dear S i r ,
I was interested t o notice i n the top right-hand
corner of the Sports Page of the last issue of "Felix"

a pot and carrying a placard reading "Bar Race". I ,
and, I am sure, many others, would be Interested to
know what, exactly, t h i s event i s .
Yours sincerely,

d i c e a g a i n s t Graham, a n d e x c i t e d much d i s c u s s i o n
of h i s message. As one s t u d e n t commented - "The

below. . -
One s t u d e n t s a i d t h i s : -
I f u l l y agreed with B i l l y Graham. There w i l l ajwys
be trouble and misery inthe world u n t i l man realises i v '
Is not economic or p o l i t i c a l change which I s the solatia*
but a change from withiirj and that can only be broohgt
about by Jesus Christ.
A n o t h e r s t u d e n t e x p r e s s e d h i s " d i s a p p o i n t m e n t
aa f o l l o w s : -
i n spite of h i s excellent presentation, B i l l y Graham's
address i n the Albert H a l l was extremely disappointing.
I t was not at a l l inspiring, the speaker at the Mission
l a s t year being f a r more convincing, and he seemed to be
preaching Morality, f a r more than l i v e Christianity, making
no direct appeal to h i s audience other than thou-htful con-
sideration of h i s remarks. Those of us who have been
! already stirred to consider Christianity by the work of
I.C.C.U. came away with a sense of disappointment.
The above s t a t e m e n t i s i n marked c o n t r a s t t o
t h e f o l l o w i n g i m p r e s s i o n : - ,
Dr. Graham placed h i s emphasis on personal s p i r i t -
ual communion with Christ rather than on the moral virtues
of Christianity. While the purifying value, Individually,
of such s p i r i t u a l experience, or i t s power, c o l l e c t i v e l y ,
cannot be denied, i t s relation to a real Deity, as con-
ceived of by Christians, Is open to some question i n
view of the fact that similar experience i s claimed by
devotees of other religions.
A more m a t e r i a l i s t i c v i e w was e x p r e s s e d ap
f o l l o w s : r
i l l those present at the Albert H a l l , regardless of
t h e i r r e l i g i o u s b e l i e f s , admit that Dr. B i l l y Graham i s
an impressive and almost overwhelming speaker. Although
he may not have converted everybody there to practising
Christianity, he achieved great success i n that he
caused the studentB to think seriously and maturely about
the present state of world a f f a i r s , and the possible
cures. And by doing t h i s , I think he helped the cause
of Peace.
if AND DO YOU CONSIDER YOUR GRANT TO BE
ENOUGH FOR A FAIR STANDARD OF LIVING ?
