The S.V.I ox T«cmiclogio8l Students Federation. 61

l i f e In tVestern Germany. They made the v i s i t during the

and Foreign a f f a i r s where personal assistants to the
ministers were available to answer questions i n t h e i r
respective f i e l d s . On one oocaasion, Paul Cross (Chairman
Of ths Guilds engineering Sooiety) referred, i n a slightly
depreciating tone, to the provincial universities only to be
•met with "Steady on o l d ohap. I'm a Merton man myselfl" I t
was discovered that a number of the o f f i c i a l s , here, were
ex-students of Oxfoxa, U.C.L & K.C.L.
The survey of factories usually commenced with a
director giving a brief outline of the factory products, war
damage and trade p o s s i b i l i t i e s . This would be followed by a
tour of the works, an excellent lunch, with wines to delight
the most c r i t i c a l palate, and a general get together whioh
involved more drinking and usually ended i n both v i s i t o r s &
hosts singing i n l i l t i n g , i f somewhat rauoous, voices.

Noticeable amongst the audience ware four recumbent figures
with open mouths and ghastly coloured tongues.

Journeying through Germany, 8000 odd miles were

R.C.S- SMOKING CONCERT.
. Imperial College has i t * "Hops", a l l three constituent
colleges have t h e i r Carnivals and ths various societies
provide danoes f o r th* work-weary student, but only th* Royal
College of Science has a Smoking Concert f o r the delight
of i t s members, who however i n the main do not seem to
appreciate the fact.
The t h i r d annual oonoert wan held on Monday March 15th
and v/ap on the whole the best yet. Whether due to bad adv-
ertising or to a general apathy on the port of the student
body, tho attendance wa.i.fer less than might have been, but
as t h i s resulted In mon free beer (and older) for those
who d i d come, no complaints on this account were voiced
although the organisers may have been a l i t t l e disappoi-
nted.
The proceedings started with a surprising lack of
s p i r i t shown by R.CS. when oalled upon to eject C.and 0.
gate-orashers but this was probably due to their custo-
mary restraint backed by tho knowledge that having triumphed
y in the matter of the Spanner, they oould afford to be lenient.
After t h i s we were treated to a series of songs and sketches,
moot of the usual student standard and with usual student
leaning towards the bawdy expressed i n various ways.
Particular attention may bo drawn to the duet by "Jim and
liobin" which was quite the finest and most polished item i n
the programme, the oxoollent duologue by the P.O. chemista
and also their s k i t on the Board of Studios enlivened by
a r t i s t i c photographs, and the very good impromptu perform-
ances by the Presidents of the Mines and the C. and 0.
Th* organisers showed i n i t i a t i v e i n omering the v a r i -
ous items, so that as tho party Bseame more noisy, t h e i r
attention was s t i l l hold to the stage. The chief compla-
int was on this matter of nolsei one was forced either to
ait near the front away from the beer and hear a l l that
was going on, or t o stay at the tack and drink so much that
one no lunger oared.
In spite of the larger supply of beer than usual, i t
unfortunately ran out Just past ths Interval, but this was
to b« expected. On this matter, d i d the performers really
require several barrels to themselves?
Several members of I.C.W.A, were present at the start,
but all had l e f t by half-tine, presumably i n disgust, but
one oannot lay, The oenoert finished at lO-SOp.n. MSC of
the audience r e t i r i n g to the Bar, leaving behind a »»«eU.i"

matically and smoothly in the Union meeting i n

The post ef Hon. Pomographer was f i n a l l y f i l l e d , after
many proposals and withdrawals, by H. Stephens. The only
lady Miner, Ruth Billington, was also given a post - Mines
representative on the Bookstall Commlttae.
Al ft result of too many last-minute proposals,
an amendment te th* Constitution was proposed and I t s first
reading passed, Where there are a surfioient number of
nomination*, no new nominations may be received during elec-
tions. This alius* does net apply te candidates who have
previously lost i n the voting for seme ether posts.
