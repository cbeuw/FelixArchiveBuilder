MEET NINUSHKA PROVAZNIK:
IPs RAG REP
M y name is N i n 11 s h k a
Provaznik. and like all the other
'What IF?' girls'I am slaving my
heart out on a two year course at
LTnstitut Francais due Royame
Uni. just a stones throw from
South Kensington tube station.
I was recently elected as Rag
Rep for IF Students' Union. This
doesn't mean that I resemble a
rag doll but that I am responsible
for selling IF shirts which are
excellent value for money.
As you can see from the photo I
have a great passion for sitting on
motor ears so beware all you
B M W owners.
I have more fantasies too
numerous to mention but I dread
the day that I reach the age ol 20.
I was going to write this article
Well, everyone else seems to
have found something of interest
to say to you all so I shall try not to
let the side down.
My name is Virginia Chalmers
and I am the treasurer of the IF
Union, (mainly because I was the
only one stupid enough to stand
for the position).
I was born in the North East of
Scotland, but when I was 2 years
old my family moved down to the
South of tmgland where we lived
for about 10 years. We then
moved back up to Scotland to a
small fishing town called
Arbroath where we have been for
the last 5 years.
When I finished mv () levels. I
went to France to stay with a
family lor 6 months. With m\
consequent knowledge of the
French language. I rami: ba'k lo
England and took the entrance
exam lot the French Institute.
Well now that you kno\ a little
bit about mc and how I c sjiric to
be at IF. I -hall try to ' I I you
something ol what m\ job a-
treasurer entail-.
As you probably already know
the French Institute is Â» very
small college and consequent!)
our Union is not as rich a- we
would like it to be. Our main
sources of income are from the
sweat-shirts, tee-shirts, stationery
and sweets that we sell in the
in Czechoslovakian so that none
of you could read it. We have a
slightly different alphabet and I
wasn't sure whether the typesetter
could cope with so many strange
characters, so in the end I decided
not to write one at all.
I think it is important that more
socializing exist between IC and
IF.
Not just between the F E L I X
Editor and the IF executive but
more generally.
If you perchance to find
yourself close to IF don't hesitate
but walk right in and say H i !
Someone will be glad to see you
and I would just love to sell you an
IF shirt or sit on your motor ear.
Love and kisses,
N i n u s h k a
MEET VIRGINIA CHALMERS:
IPs TREASURER
Union room, not forgetting, of
curse, our beloved coffee
machines, (when they are
actually working!).
My main duties are to settle
any bills that we receive (if we
have any money left in the bank at
the time), to pay in all the money
we make from the things we sell,
and to keep a constant supply of
2ps in the Union Room for our
coffee machines.
All of us in the Union here are
trying desperately lo get more-
girls involved with the Union and
the activities organised by-
Imperial. However, this has
proved quite difficult as a great
percentage of the girls live outside
of L o n d o n and commute
everyday. It is therefore very
difficult for them to take part in
any of the evening activities.
We shall keep on al them all the
same and hopefully some of them,
at least, wiH respond.
I'd just like to say a qUick
thankyou to all last year's Union
for helping us to get settled in this
year and explaining to us exactly
what our jobs entail. We do
appreciate their help.
Well I think that's about it.
Please feel free to come down and
visit us in the Union Room
sometime. A l l visitors are
welcome, but we accept no
responsibility lor the coffee.
