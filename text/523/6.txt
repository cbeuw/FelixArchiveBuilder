An Autumn Fairy Tale
There once was a land called Imperia.
In this land lived m a n y strange and wonderful creatures who studied the magical
arts to teach the rest of the w o r l d a n d to create new and exciting contraptions that
would make life easier for their fellow creatures. M a n y travelled f r o m far distant
worlds to come to Imperia and looked strange compared to the ordinary inhabitants
of the continent of K e n Sing T o n i n which Imperia stood. Creatures f r o m overseas,
(Yellow yillons, green garrions, and red ransis) played happily with the blue bizons
that came f r o m local continents.
In the beginning the magic was all good magic and the creatures used wisely the
m a n y bags of gold placed i n their position by other inhabitants o f the continent.
However, it cannot be assumed that the creatures met no problems. Surrounding the
land of Imperia was a great forest.
E a c h of our friendly creatures could have built his o w n tree hut with plenty of space.
However, the land was ruled by the Talists who employed black demons called Capits.
T h e Capits could lly from tree to tree protecting them from occupation even if their o w n
masters had no purpose in mind for the trees. T h e fligh. of the Capits was a terrible sight. As they
rose in groups to light off any offenders against their rule, the very sun itself would be blotted out
by a huge black cloud of squalling flesh.
O u r creatures lived in fear ol the Capits and the Talists who controlled the trees outside their
little land, so they tried to grow their o w n trees inside the boundaries of safety. T h e trees grew
slowly and space became scarce because the ground was filled with the equipment they needed
to successfully perform their magic. Eventually, despite the creatures sharing many trees many
had to seek a compromise with the demons outside and they bribed the Capits with gold. O n e of
the smallest pots of gold was given to the individual creatures in order to keep a tree hut in good
order and buy lbod and personal equipment. T h e creatures had to offer up to half of what they
had been given this way in order to be able to bribe the greedy Capits.
Because of the problem ol the trees and many other problems all the creatures of Imperia met
together and had a great discussion. T h e whole land was lil led with the chatter of voices and the
Capits lied for a while from the edge of the forest in fear of the sound of so many yillons, garrions
bizons and ransis meeting together. They decided to form a great organisation called the O n i o n .
It would be called the O n i o n because it would bring them close together like the layers ol a n
onion and because, while its organisations would grow, like the onion, underground, its leaves
on the surface would spread manifold from the effect of their actions.
They elected many leaders lor the O n i o n and the leaders appointed wise people to help them
find the best action to take a n d to help organise the parties a n d other activities, (sports like
gambolling, reacting and sombling). organisetl by the O n i o n .
Y o u may have thought that only the
creatures of the land ruled over the magic in
Imperia and decided how to guard the pots of
gold but i n this I would have misled you.
O v e r the land there in fact ruled a Baron who
was appointed by the W i z a r d Dcsdree
(known as Des for short). Des and his servant,
U n i t i a Grasson C o n t i (known as U G C ) ,
issued edicts to the Baron and the Baron
would have to accept their wrath if he
disobeyed.
The Baron appointed servants to guard the
pots of gold which were stored in his castle in
the centre of the land. T h e Baron would often
lean out of level 5 of his castle and stare
around at the land he controlled. However,
the Baron d i d not always rule wisely. Often
he was too busy to take not ice of the problems
of the creatures in his control even when the
leaders of the O n i o n came to see him. T h e
Baron travelled to different continents or
sometimes he went off to play games with
other Barons from that continent who held
great meetings.
The sen ants appointed by the Baron were
strange animals. Not all liked the little
creatures inhabiting the land. O n e such was a
wolf called S a m m y who guarded the pot of
gold that was meant to help the little
creatures grow good food to live oil. T h e wolf
like the look of the gold and didn't like to
allow any ol it out of the pot. H e would howl
all night staring at the gold & during the day
silently pad around the levels of the castle
with a hungry look of hatred in his eyes. It
was rumoured that in his past S a m m y had
worked for the Talists a n d most thought he
would be better serving the creatures of the
w ild forest. T h e O n i o n organised its member
creatures to organise raids on this pot a n d
were sometimes successful in bettering their
lot - but that is another story.
The purpose of this story is to tell of a time
when the wizardry of Des came under the
control of evil people within the continent.
These evil people wanted to foster hatred
amongst the people of the continent a n d
claimed that the pots of gold in Imperia (and
other such lands were being used for outside
purposes. They wished to take control of the
magic learnt and developed at Imperia to use
only for their own people and did not want it
to be shared amongst the people of the world
and the universe.
A time came to pass when Des and U G C
ordered the Baron to create a new pot of gold
to be many times greater than the ones
already in his possession. H e was to use the
sweat and labour of the green garrions, the
red ransis and yellow yillons. H e was to make
them all pay into the pot and if they did not
he would whip them and torture them until
they would be forced to leave the land of
Imperia.
The d a y the B a r o n b o o m e d bis
announcement out of the castle the creatures
wept and wailed. The O n i o n organised many
big meetings and everyone was united
against the creation of the new pot. T h e
Baron said that he had no choice but to obey
Des or else he would himself IK: sent from the
land. T h e (realtires from overseas worked
hard in the outside forests to try to gain some
gold but the Talists paid them little. Later,
the evil people controlling Des also ordered
the Talists only to employ creatures from
their o w n continent. T h e creatures from
overseas could then only rely on help from
their homelands. There was much poverty
amongst the garrions, yillions, etc, and the
O n i o n pleaded with the Baron to be merciful.
For a time the Baron whipped and tortured
lew a n d the community was able to be
relatively peaceful.
Then, one autumn, as the trees in the forest
glinted red, brown and yellow in the light of
the sun low in the sky a terrible cry set u p in
the land. T h e leaders ol the O n i o n rushed to
the castle. In front of the castle ranged the
Baron a n d all his servants, each carrying
some terrible instrument of torture a n d
threatening a cowering creature from
overseas. Above the crowd towered the vision
of Des, dressed in Black and perching on the
top ol the castle checking that his edicts were
performed. T h e noise of screaming a n d
shouting filled the air a n d the Capits in
curiosity flew over above until, seeing Des,
they scattered back in the forest.
The creatures from overseas began to leave
the land. T h e magic ol the land was no longer
so great and much new magic was not
developed. However, the torture continued
and the land never returned to its happy
contentment.
Eventually the blue bizons were the only
ones remaining and they were sad at having
lost their friends a n d there was m u c h
mourning in the land.
