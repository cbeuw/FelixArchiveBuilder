Sioux still fight for rights
Viewers of the television programme,
Centennial, will probably sympathise with the
struggle of the American Indians.
Descendents of Sitting Bull, the Sioux
Chief shot by the U S Cavalry in 1890, were
angered by a Washington court award of
millions of dollars in compensation for the
seizure of their lands a century ago.
The Judge ruled that the Sioux are entitled
to $17,500,000 for the 'fair market value' ofthe
B l a c k Hills of D a k o t a , b e c a u s e the
confiscation in 1877 violated the Indians'
constitutional rights. They are eligible to
receive interest which the court estimated
could be as high as $115 million.
The Indians are worried that the bulk of
their award will disappear into the pockets of
Washington lawyers.

nursery rhymes obviously all those happy
hours chanting amo, amas, amat, amamus,
amatis, amant - were to be for some future
purpose.

Allergic to the 20th century
A new allergy that is beginning to affect an
increasing number of Americans is being
dubbed, "an allergy to the 20th century". An
allergist described the case of Scott Jablin.
He stated that his patient developed a
poisonous substance inside his body
whenever he came in contact with modern
domestic furniture - everything from the
television to the telephone, from chairs to
carpets.
Mr Jablin has to spend every 24 hours
sitting or sleeping on a wooden bench in a
friend's backyard. He breathes bottled air
through a cotton mask with a charcoal filter.

many more people witn the same problem.
They say that the more garbage we put into
the world the more people there will be whose
bodies break down from it.
