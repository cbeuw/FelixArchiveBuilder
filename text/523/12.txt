Environmental Society
We are at last able to carry out our threat to run an Env. Soc, field trip
and are proposing to terrorise the population of Suffolk one weekend in
August.
Full details of itinerary, cost etc cannot be worked out until we havea
full list of names, but the trip will be subsidised from Env. Soc. funds and
should not cost more than £10 for the weekend. The dates are
provisionally set as Friday 24th August - Sunday 26th August, and visits
to Minsmere, an R S P B bird reserve, and the A d n a m s Brewery are
planned. If you are interested in coming, plase contact Dave Trevor-
Jones at the Centre for Environmental Technology (Int 3703) before
Friday 29th June. The number of places is limited, and those who come
will have to become Society members if they are not already. Although
the weekend is in the middle of the Summer Vacation undergraduates
are very welcome to come: the awkward timing is rather unfortunate and
not in any way intended to discriminate against undergrads!
RIDING CLUB
Following the Club's A G M and the vote of thanks for the committee
1978-79, I would like to take this opportunity to thank everybody who
helped with the running ofthe C l u b and all the courageous members
who continued riding throughout the bleak winter defying horses and
elements!
This year, we were able for the first time to form two groups to
represent I C at the U L U League fixtures, therefore I would like to
thank A n i t a Heathcote, C a t h r y n Grey-Turner, l o n a Parkinson from
Institut Francais and A m a n d a Still ( C C O ) J u l i a n Singer ( Geology),
Sue Wright (Zoology) from IC, not forgetting our U L U representative
Paul Ellis (Physics).
W i t h regards to the new 'pilot scheme' of having R i d i n g C l u b T -
shirts printed, the price will be around £2.20 and they will be ready by
or just after the end of term, when everybody will be notified, by
internal mail, ofthe Club's meeting with the T-Shirts on sale (also on
Freshers' Fair). T h e T-Shirts will be sold to present or past C l u b
members.
Finally, I wish you all the best lor your examination results/future
career/research slogging!
