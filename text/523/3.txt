NEWS IN BRIEF
BEIT SAFETY
College are at last to take action
over the safety of women in Beit
H a l l where the main door to the
hostel cannot be locked.
Estates section is to begin work
on strengthening the doors a n d
providing good locks to prevent
strangers entering at night.
Discussions are to take place
about the possible provision of an
answerphone system for all Beit
residents.
BEER RIP-OFF
M a l c o l m Brain, piss artist
e x t r a o r d i n a r y , h a s b e e n
appointed chairman of the Bar
Committee for next session. H e
takes over from A n d y Middleton.
A bar price survey by A n d y
M i d d l c t o n has shown that I C bar
prices are of the same order as
p u b s e l s e w h e r e i n S o u t h
Kensington.
H e told Council that this was a
matter for concern as I C prices
are the most expensive in the
University of L o n d o n and are
higher than in pubs in many of the
areas where students live.
It is College policy that I C bars
should be as profitable as possible.
T h e U n i o n are to try to reverse
this policy which will probably
r e q u i r e a G o v e r n i n g Body
decision.
BLOOD GIVEN
A total of 268 students gave
blood over two days this term
w h e n t h e N a t i o n a l B l o o d
Transfusion Service visited the
College.
The Service has sent a message
of thanks to all volunteers.
Last year 369 students gave
blood over a period of three days.
A barrel of beer awarded to the
department giving the most blood
went to Life Sciences but it has
not been claimed to date.
WELFARE CENTRE USED
About 3,000 visits were made to
the U n i o n Welfare Centre this
year. T h e U n i o n see this as
confirmation that the Centre is
fulfilling a need not previously
recognised to exist by College,
especially as an accommodation
service.
UNION MONEY CUT
The U n i o n is to receive
£\26,525 from College in 1979/80.
This is a cut of ,£7,500 on the
estimate put in by the U n i o n and
has meant that an overall 4 per
cent cut has been forced on all
expenditure.
U n i o n Finance Committee,
meeting last Friday, decided not
to cut the grant to City and Guilds
U n i o n as their original estimate
had been very low.
DAY NURSERY
D a y n u r s e r y c h a r g e s to
students are to go up by £1 per
week to £16. Charges to staff will
be £20.80, representing a 6.7 per
cent increase. T h e subsidy of
£5,000 for student places remains
the same as last year.
Chelsea College, which has five
places in the nursery has been told
to withdraw early in 1980 because
t h e n u r s e r y is b e c o m i n g
overcrowded. Chelsea College is
having difficulties finding a
building to house their nursery.
UNION CARD
Next year's U n i o n card will
include an advertisement by the
National Westminster Bank. T h e
U n i o n will receive £450.
The deal means that plans to
include a list of useful telephone
numbers have been dropped.
RADIO FIRST
L a s t S u n d a y I C R a d i o
broadcast what could be the first
real breakfast programme ever.
Assistant Station Manager
Harvey N a d i n , who usually does
the Sunday morning slot, decided
to celebrate the end of term by
presenting the show live from his
bedroom a n d providing a full
breakfast lor anyone who turned
up.
People began arriving soon
alter the eight o'clock start, coffee
mugs in hand, a n d included the
H a l l Warden, Frank Potter, a n d
his wile, U n i o n Deputy President
M a l c o l m Brain, who smothered
his cornflakes in beer, and other
students including Paul Fairbairn
clad in pyjamas and a tie. Harvey-
soon found that he h a d barely-
enough food to cope with demand
despite a shopping spree the day
before.
The programme required a
special two-way line, laid from
Harvey's Keogh room to the
station control room in the
Southside basement where the
operating was done.
T h e breakfast itself continued
until well after the three-hour
programme had ended, except for
some members of the station who
had to prepare the equipment lor
one of I C Radio's more usual
outside broadcasts that evening,
from Stan's Bar in Southside.
RAG RECORD

achieved a record collection this
year. Figures released this week
