A L T E R N A T I V E L I V I N G
During the course of the coming academic year, as an
annomymous union officer, I shall be writingregular articles on
those aspects of college life that we didn't dare mention in the
handbook. Week by week you will be kept informed with the
current problems being dealt with by the union disciplinary
committee on which I sit ex-officio as victim (1 presently hold
the post of union scape-goat).
Some ofthe most important problems I aim to deal with are summed
up by a few ofthe titles my articles shall be headed with. For example: -
H o w to get thrown out of your ilat (part 1)
Five easy ways of failing exams (written with voice of experience)
H o w to get thrown out of your Hat (part 2).
H o w to get a place on union disciplinary committee.
K i l l ambition and stand for ten union posts.
H o w to get round your cleaner.
H o w to cook food better than College can (short article).
H o w to get thrown out of your ilat (part 3).
O n a more serious vein will be a being thrown out of flats so I have

F r o m 16th September the
U n i o n will be able to provide
accomodation in Southside Halls
for a week and in Crash Pad in
the U n i o n Building from 23rd
September. T h e cost will be fifty
pence per night and sleeping bags
will be necessary as linen will
neither be provided in the U n i o n
or Southside Halls. F o r those
accommodated in Southside a key
deposit will be charged. N o
booking will be necessary as the
service will be r u n informally
from the U n i o n Office, so all you
have to do is call in to the U n i o n
Office when you arrive in L o n d o n
and we'll take it from there.
Wahay!

Welfare Bod
syringe and the problems of O D .
(overdraft). O n a less serious I
shall be making a feasibility study
of the prospects of turning the
U n i o n Building into a Casino, an
idea proposed by at least two
presidential candidates.
I aim to show that Welfare can
be fun and will follow this year's
Welfare D a y where condom
blowing, dirty films and free beer
were the attractions. I envisage a
Welfare Night a n d perhaps,
depending on how things go, a
M o r n i n g After.
C o m m u n i c a t i o n between the
various services provided by the
college will be at its best next
year as I have a rare foot deseasc
and so a m constantly i n the
Health Centre. I am perpetually
got to know M i c h a e l A r t h u r and
the Welfare Centre in the U n i o n
Building. T h e Accomodation
Office at 8 Princes Gardens
confuses me a n d I often find
myself in the D a y Nursery by
mistake.
T h e Student Councellor lives
somewhere in No. 12 though I'm
not sure exactly where since he
moved upstairs so I a m now
consulting Nightline in No. 10.
As the unanimously elected
Secretary's friend I shall be going
night release (they only let me in
during the day) to the local
secretarial college.
T o finish, why not ask yourself
a serious question "Why are you
reading this?"
