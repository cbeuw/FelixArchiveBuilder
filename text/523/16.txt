BALLOON CLUB
Few people can have m i s s e d last weekend's T V coverage of
the International Balloon Meet at- Sudeley Castle in
Gloucestershire.
105 balloons had registered for the meet, including IC's own
balloon 'Vulcan'. The meet was scheduled te.take place f r o m
m i d d a y Friday through to Sunday evening, but balloon club
decided to depart for Sudeley on T h u r s d a y evening to be first
in.
Lashed by hail on the way down, and blown about by strong winds
on the Friday morning while doing a tethered flight for A T V ' s A T V
Today' programme, the weather looked set.tokeep all the balloons on
their trailers for the weekend.
Come Friday evening the campsite was full of long faced balloonists
muttering about the xxxx weather. , ,
Saturday dawned, and somehow an overnight miracle had been
wrought. Summer had arrived. T h e whole camp rose as one at 5 a m for
briefing. A perfect 5 knot NVV wind greeted us, and balloons began to
lift off into the blue sky. i *'
While most people were Hying
only for fun, we had a slightly
more serious weekend ahead. T h e
two other U K university balloon
clubs had also come to the meet
for a prearranged match.
East Anglia with their balloon
'Boadicea', and E d i n b u r g h with
their giant sized 'James Tyler'.
O u r aim was to win the U K
Universities Hot A i r Balloon
Challenge C u p . V e r y fittingly
presented by Anglia Industrial
Gases, the original owners of our
balloon, and a subsidiary of
British Oxygen, our sponsors.
T h e lirst task was a pilot-
declared goal. Here the pilot
declares a chosen destination
before take oil, and attempts to
use the available winds to steer
himself to his destination. T h e
closest to his goal wins.
U E A ' s pilot, M i k e Betts, chose
a pub, the Puesdown Inn, for his
target, while Edinburgh's Asmat
K a h n and myself thought the
winds would steer us further east.
In the end it was U E A ' s bold
decision that won out with
Edinburgh second, and us last.
Not a good start
Back for breakfast, refuelling,
lunch and then briefing. T h e
weather still-,brilliant, we decided
on' a 'Hare ahd Hounds' for our
nex^ task. T h i s i n v o l v e d a 'Hare'
balloon which took oil'some time
before the three 'hounds'. T h e
idea being to follow the hare as it
dodged Mbout, and land as close to
him as possible.
A somewhat chaotic take off
meant ihat the three balloons
were staggered. W E A oif first,
then IC, finally E d i n b u r g h . W i t h
the hare jrcsight off to our right wc
ascended to 7000 ft to get a right-
hand drift, passing over the hare's
track and catching up with him
by using, the faster winds at that
altitudf. But then he was down,
and a fast descent back to ground
level to ^ r y t o ' land by him. Too
late - we were off to his right by
some way, E d i n b u r g h took lirst
with U E A third.
T h e , day ended with the
Statutory' imbibing of alcohol
before retiring for another 5 a m
briefing on the Sunday.
D a w n broke - the sky was
oveijcast, but this meant more
light winds and we all flew oll'on a
IC's balloon
J u d g e d e c l a r e d goal: ' T h e
Puesdown Inn'. U E A were off to
the right the whole time, but it
took some low Hying to open up a
mile gap to shake oil Edinburgh.
This did the trick, and as we
floated less than 100 It from the
Inn we thought we had it made -
but power lines and fields full of
corn precluded a landing for
another mile, we finally landed to
take first place by only a few-
hundred metres. E d i n b u r g h 2nd.
U E A third.
This ended our competition
and left a dead heat between all
three balloon teams, which we
instantly agreed lo he the best
possible result. The cup has now
been brought back to IC as it is
the first time we have competed
for it - and nobody else wanted to

T h e last llight of the weekend

Sudeley Castle, Hying three more
