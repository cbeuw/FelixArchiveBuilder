God's glory and man's dignity
L o r d , our L o r d ,
your greatness is seen in all the world!
Y o u r praise reaches up to the heavens;
it is sung by children and babies.
Y o u have built a fortress against your foes
to stop your enemies and adversaries.
W h e n I look at the sky, which you have made,
at the moon and the stars, which you set in their places -
what is man, that you think of him;
mere man, that you care for him?
Yet you made him inferior only to yourself;
you crowned him with glory and honour.
Y o u made h i m ruler over all you have made;
you placed h i m over all things;
sheep and cattle, and wild animals too;
the birds and the fish,
and all the creatures in the seas.
L o r d , our L o r d ,
your greatness is seen in all the world!

H Sharp sweet empty bitterness 5
There is nothing left but this JS
Three years and now they're finished; 2
S T h e final aloe kiss 2
3 A n d all the friends I've known? No-more.
2 Scattered on some other shores ™
™ Their lives with mine will nevermore
™ So closely touch and interlink. JJ
Nothing will ever be the same;
Though some will lose and some will gain
This day to all brings strange rewards
A n d thoughts to haunt our drunkeness
A n d when I think of all my fears
A n d all those lost and happy years ™
A n d all the days I've yet to see ...
W h y are my eyes so filled with tears...?
Eiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiir.
Mel Kinkie's Last Ride
It's not easy trying to write
a farewell article. I've thought
long and h a r d and I'm still not
quite sure what to say. T h i s is
the last official article /
report I'll write as H o n .
Secretary, a n d brings to an
end three years of writing for
Broadsheet and F E L I X (what
a comparison!), a n d in many
ways brings to an end 4 years
at IC; and I'm not sure what to
say. I've got m i x e d feelings
about the impending end, and
m y new life as a real person
once again - it'll be nice to
enter the somewhat calmer,
saner outside world again;
but then I've certainly h a d
some good times here, had an
amazing array o f exper-
iences a n d met a fantastic
variety o f people - one thing I
don't think I'll ever lose are
the strong emotional ties I
feel with IC. T h e last four
years have been a formative
experience (I think that's the
right term).
Anyway - a l l you people out
there probably aren't interested
in the parting thoughts of an
aging hack who's found that
eternal a n d everlasting life
doesn't exist in Imperial College
Union. Actually it does sort of -
for the paltry sum of £9.00 you
can become a life member of K ! U ,
- which entitles you to the use of
all U n i o n facilities for the rest of
your lite; a n d that includes
membership of a l l clubs a n d
societies a n d use" of the Sports
Centre. It's a n opportunity you
can't afford to miss.
As regards parking permits for
J u l y -1 discussed it with the traffic
warden at the Exhibition R d
entrance, J o h n Fuller, and we
decided that instead of issuing
actual permits, if you wish to park
over the Summer and have not
got a permit, simply register with
him.
Well that's got the information
bit over; and almost the article bit
over. I'll just end with a lyric from
an obscure song by Peter
H a m m i l l called childlike faith in
childhood's E n d :
'Though dark is the highway
and the peaks distance breaks my
heart
Though I never shall see it
Still I play my part
Believing what waits for us
Is the Cosmos compared with the
dust of the past
In the death of mere humans
L I F E - S H A L L - S T A R T .
How's that for an obscure
ending?
Hope to see you around again
sometime.
Cheers,
M i k e E l k i n
P.S. Sex isn't everything, y o u
know!
