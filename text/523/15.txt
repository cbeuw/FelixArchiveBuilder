The Liberal Club held its last meeting of the year on Tuesday and was
able to congratulate its new treasurer, Richard Earl, both on his election
as Chairman of the IC Postgraduate Group and to the College
Governing Body and Finance and Executive Committees.
The future of F O R W A R D ! was discussed and Sonia Hochfelder was
appointed Editor of the Freshers' issue, and Richard Earl was appointed
Editor of the subsequent issue in October.
Tribute was paid to Paul Fairbairn's editorship of F O R W A R D ! and to
the enormous amount of time he spent on both this and his position as
Club Chairman. All the more commendable considering he was also
Civil Engineering Departmental Representative, on countless Union
committees and trying hard to get a degree. He will be missed by all
members of the Club, and we wish him all the best for the future.

provide an opportunity for both

questions about Liberalism (and
also to down a few pints of E S B ) !
IC Liberal C l u b was formed in
I974 when Alan Beith, MP,
attended the inaugural meeting.
Since then many distinguished
politicians have spoken at C l u b
meetings and events, including Jo
Grimond, Lord Gladwyn, Peter
Hain, Lord Avebury, and, most
recently, the Liberal leader David
Steel, who opened the national
conference of the Union of Liberal
Students which was organised by
O n Wednesday 13th June (unlucky for some) a notorious
bunch f r o m the Royal College of Science descended upon
C h a r i n g C r o s s Station at 8 a.m. en route for Calais.
A crate of Swan later they arrived in Dover and then suffered
a Channel crossing by hovercraft.
O n arrival in " l a belle F r a n c e " and having exasperated the bus
driver by offering 50 franc notes for a 3 franc journey, it was decided to
partake in a cup of "cafe au lait". This created total confusion even with
the help of Steve's French dictionary - but they succeeded in the end.
As the French are an hour ahead they arrived with all the shops
closed for lunch. This decided the course of action and everyone went
their separate ways.
Some members of the party felt very extravagant and invested in
oysters, lobster and numerous bottles of wine. Others had French bread
and plonk at 3 francs a bottle in the park.
A stock of wine was built up before boarding the bus to the hoverport
where a large amount of duty free spirits was purchased. But
unfortunately the homeward journey was rather rough and poor
Patrick lost his lobster!
Back on the train once the wine was produced the carriage cleared
rapidly due to the singing of those very polite songs everyone knows so
well!
The intrepid band arrived back in L o n d o n at 9 p.m. with plenty of
time to get to the U n i o n Bar before closing time. This proved fatal for
certain individuals but an excellent day was had by all, thanks to Nick
Davies who worked hard to organise this monster event.

Liberalism can provide a radical
and effective solution to the
country's problems, and that you
don't have to be a socialist to want
a fairer and more just society,
where the individual can be free
from oppression and exploitation.
Clearly, with the recent election

Governments since the war, and
one of the most reactionary of

important that an alternative
strategy is presented, which is
relevant to the vast majority of IC
students. It will be the task of IC
Liberal C l u b to put forward a new
economic strategy both radical
and just in its nature, which lays a
far greater emphasis on the role of
the community in both industry
and Government.
