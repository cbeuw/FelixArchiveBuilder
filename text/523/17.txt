'Back to the Egg' - Wings
It's strange that the word
'album' should be used to
describe LP records. Normally,
the word refers to a collection, a
group of things with a common
theme - 1,238 pictures of Auntie
Margie on Blackpool Pier every
summer since 1949. With records,
however, it's often impossible to
regard them as anything but 10
songs coincidentally on the same
disc. So it is with this 'album'.
Wings, under Paul McCartney,
have always produced very varied
records - the sheer range of songs
is impressive - but on this new
collection it would seem that
McCartney has lost his way. Not
only are the songs almost
confusingly varied in pace and
style, but many hark back (or
across) to some other Wings
opus. (Is the title 'Back to the Egg'
a clue??)
Having said all that, I must add
that the music is very good, and I
like the record very much indeed.
There are, of course, the weak
points - for instance, on how many
records have you heard the old
trick of tuning a radio into a song
which just happens to be the next
on the record? If this trick annoys
you (and it certainly does me),
then try and avoid track 1, side 1,
'Reception'. Not an auspicious
start - the music itself is fine, but
why oh why throw in the effects?
From there on in, you have to
keep your wits about you. The
next song 'Getting Closer', is a
good Wings soft-rocker, followed
quickly by a typical McCartney
ballad-style crooner, 'We're open
tonight'. Then headlong and
headbang into the fast and furious
'Spin it on' - almost New Wave,
this. See what I mean about
variety? A n d we're only halfway
through side 1.
The slightly worrying thing
about it all is; a lot of it has been
done before - by McCartney
himself. Phrases that I have just
used, like ' - a typical Wings...' are
the give-away. Make no mistake,
they're all good, but then they
were when he did them the first
time.
A slight change comes with 2 of
the tracks on side 2, featuring the
famed 'Rockestra'. I'm sure you
remember last summer, and the
dark mutterings about the
greatest c o l l e c t i o n of R o c k
musicians ...' and so on - all
supposedly recording together
for McCartney. The fruits of these
sessions are on side 2 - the
'Rockestra Theme' and 'So glad to
see you here'. So, if you've always
wanted to hear the sound of 5
guitarists, 3 drummers, 4 bassists,
3 pianists, 2 'keyboard' players, 4
percussionists (non-drummers?),
and 4 Horn players all slogging
away together, then this is for you.
This combination has limited
interest - give me a spoons and
comb duet any day.
So what are the conclusions?
Well, Wings are marking time with
this one. It's good, and will find its
way into the collections of all
McCartney devotees, and a few
others too. A n d by the way, my
favourite song is 'After the Ball' - it
sounds just like 'Amazing Grace'.
Oh what a give-away ...

Rickie Lee Jones -
Rickie Lee Jones (Warner
Bros).
A few weeks ago the ' O l d Grey
Whistle Test' did a short feature
on Rickie Lee Jones, showing a
w o n d e r f u l l y p r o d u c e d p r o -
motional film of herself walking
around town and peforming with
her band. Together the film and
the pair of songs stirred up enough
interest that the release of the
single did not go unnoticed
(although IC R a d i o were unable
to play it) and the single ' C h u c k
E's in Love' persuaded me to go
out and get a copy of the album.
Although I did not know quite
what to expect I fell in love with
the a l b u m right away.
This girl, coming from the same
background as the Eagles, Steve
M i l l e r and similar West Coast
Musicians, has come out with a
style of her own, virtually singing
the Blues.
In one way the music sounds
disjointed, though disjointed may-
be i n a c c u r a t e , there is a
coherency about it, yet each note
from each instrument seems to
have been individually placed,
often only seeming to blend
together, when strung together
with the singing.
She has already been compared
with Springsteen, and perhaps
the lyrics do have some quality in
common with some of his, yet this
album is infinitely more relaxing,
the vocals more controlled, more
compelling listening and she is
certainly prettier.
T h e closest comparison must
be, and I don't mean to be too
rude, Merrie Wilson. R L J
manages to give the same
personal feel to a song, in the
breathy loose way the lyrics roll
olf her tongue.
The musicianship of the
backing band seems to be quietly-
competent whilst doing little else
but accentuating the vocals, until
it gets pushed to the front, as in
' Y o u n g Blood' especially when
the music becomes a lot tighter
and the sound gets much more
exciting instrumentally.
If you're one of those peoplei
that read a lot into the Lyrics of a
song you may be disappointed
with these: although at first sight
they appear to be trying to say a
lot, upon closer inspection they
b e c o m e c a s u a l observations
r a t h e r t h a n c o n s t r u c t i v e
comments on anything. Rickie
Lee Jones sometimes sings in such
a way that words arc barely-
distinguishable and are more
important for the mood and tone
in which they are such than for
their content.
There are two tracks worth
singling out from the rest. One,
the single ' C h u c k E's in Love'
gives a good standard for assessing
the rest of the album, although it
is perhaps a little more catchy and
irresistable than most tracks it
relies on a slow rhythm
strummed out on guitar, with a
slightly unimaginative d r u m
section, backing up R L J singing
up front.
Also, 'Danny's A l l Star Joint' -
bringing back memories of
'Telephone M a n ' by Merrie
Wilson, - which if you can
understand all the American
slang stands out as the strongest
track on the album, here R L J
moves much more towards jazz
than on any of the other tracks.
So il you're looking for
^something a little laid back to
relax to I'd go as far as
recommending this.

JOHN OTWAY -
Where did I go Right (Polydor)
J o h n O t w a y h a s h a d a
reputation as a real head case.
Well forget that, because on this
showing he's calmed down so
much that even Clement Freud
seems lively in comparison. The
music has always been pretty
basic, but the lyrics of the Otway -
Wild Willy Barrett duo easily
overcompensated. Thinking back
to the classics, 'Really Free',
'Josephine' and 'Beware of the
Flowers' (for example), all had
a m u s i n g , interesting and very
accessible story lines What we
have here is bland music and
lyrics that are either boring and
cliched or just plain unintelligible.
'Where did I go right,' asks Otway.
Let's face it, John, you're not
fooling anyone.
Yet the album title sums up the
Otway spirt; a cross between
confidence (I have succeeded) and
a n a r c h i c a l s e l f - d e s t r u c t i o n
(despite all my efforts to the
contrary, I have succeeded),
which has in the past worked but
in this case flounders.
Redeeming features? Well the
production of Neil Innes (of
Bonzo Dog Band and Monty
Python fame) is excellent, so at
least every track has a fighting
chance, but somehow something
always pulls it down. The cliches,
the painfully old-fashioned music
or just the fact that the song is no
good. But back at the good bits:
urn, there aren't any more. What
this album does have is three
good tracks but that's hardly a
recommendation to buy.
All the songs on the LP, which
incidently lasts all of thirty five
minutes, are written by Otway,
except 'The Highwayman', a
superb adaptation of a poem by
Alfred Noyes, which is far and
away the best track, and it's not
even recent material. Synthesised
wind, atmospheric organ music
and Otway's curious vocal style all
lend themselves to the fine
rendition. The opening number,
'Makes good music', provides a
solid foundation for the album,
the infectious rhythm of this semi-
autobiographical song blending
neatly with the vocals. 'What
better time than now to take a look
at your life,' Otway sings, 'guess
you never got nothing right.'
The only other track worth an
honourable mention is 'Blue Eyes
of the Belle', a slow, graceful song
of young love and marital loyalty;
'their's was a love that could never
be' - type slush - but it works.
The current single, 'Frightened
and Scared', is so nondescript
that I couldn't even remember
which track it was after I first
heard the album. But then the
whole thing is like that - stark,
sometimes purposely so, with
little relief. In fact I actually fell
asleep listening to the first side, so
I suppose it may pick up on the
insomniac's market i „ „ C i , f K
