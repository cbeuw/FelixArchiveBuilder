RCSU vs RCSA
The highlight of the R C S sporting calendar is the annual
cricket match against the old students association. F o r the
first time this year there was a cup to be played for, the Stan
Raimes trophy. As there was something to play for, R C S U took
it seriously a n d selected the best eleven cricketers available
ignoring the tradition o f selecting 'Union Hacks'.
The R C S U X I were led by A . N . A r b whose first master stroke of the
day was to win the toss and put R C S A in to bat. It was only at this stage
we discovered R C S A had twelve men but we allowed this small
anomoly to pass, knowing we could bowl them out-. T h e bowling was
opened by the Sylph-like figure ol Swain. Bowling at unbelievable pace,
Swain picked up a useful early wicket and returned in a later spell to
pick up two more. The other opening bowler was Imran Misra whose
medium-pace seamers were a real education and probably deserved
more than the one wicket they realised.

Wednesday 6th June
H a v i n g waited for 4 members of the side to finish exams,
supercaptain Furnish eventually led the 1st X I out to Harlington to
face K e n t o n Traders. The toss was lost as per usual and I C were put in
the field.

some very lucky runs. T h e 1st wicket fell at 42 when a leg side glance fell
into Davis' gloves, both Davis and Wyatt were too surprised to realise
that this constituted a wicket, the batsman, however, knew he'd been
outsmarted and began to long trek back to the pavilion. Wyatt struck
again at 53 when another shot went into the air, this time, however,
supercaptain Furnish decided to wake up and take the catch.

Marathon Championships
Mark Pickard ran his fastest ever marathon on Sunday to finish 11th in
the British Student Championships. The race was held at Sandbach,
Cheshire o n aflat 3 lap course, reputedly the fastest marathon course in
Britain. Mark's time of 2 hours 40 minutes 44 seconds was all the more
remarkable for the fact that he had completed a 40 mile walk in the Lake
District the previous day.
The other IC runner in the London team was David Rosen, having a
steady run to finish 17th in 2-51-25. With lan Duncan of University
College making up the team, London took third place behind Durham
and Leeds. *
