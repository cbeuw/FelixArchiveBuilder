The sentence "let's go to the Union Building" has taken on a whole
new meaning and students now have to think twice before accepting
this apparently innocent invitation.
For at its meeting on Monday IC Union Council agreed to allow sexual
intercourse on Union premises provided it Is "discreet and
unavoidable".
The motion was proposed by Mike " M e l Kinkie" Elkin, Union
Honorary Secretary, and was the culmination of a long campaign in his
FELIX articles in which the subject of sex probably received more
attention than any other issue.
Supporting his motion Mike Elkin said that sexual intercourse had
occurred this year in the Union Building but the Executive had "turneda
blind eye to it". This decision followed naturally from Union policy in
support of gay rights and the legalisation of cannabis, he argued.
Council had made fornication a discipline offence in 1974, a policy
revoked by this week's decision. It will be up to the Executive to decide
when sex is "unavoidabe".
The meeting was attended by
members of both the current and
the incoming Councils. The bulk
of its business concerned the
annual reports of Union officers
and committees, and elections of
members to represent the Union
on College committees next year.
In a keenly contested election
for the three Union observers on
College's Governing Body a n d
Finance and Executive C o m m i -
ttees Chris Fox, incoming Union
President, Malcolm Brain, Deputy
President and Richard Earl,
incoming Postgraduate Affairs
Officer, were elected, defeating
seven other candidates.
Council went on to discuss
several motions and proposals.
