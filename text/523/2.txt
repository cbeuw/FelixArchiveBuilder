Dear Sir, - In his letter of 15th
June ( F E L I X 522) M r Purewal
claims that he knew that I had
w r i t t e n the l e t t e r s i g n e d
'Independent Observer" ( F E L I X
521). In fact, he didn't know until
I told bim. I have borne no
personal grudge against M r
Purewal, as he alleges. Indeed, if
he will care to read the India Soc
election memorandum, he will
find that I was one of the people
who proposed him for the
presidency. It was M r Purewal's
reaction to his defeat, rather than
any animosity, which prompted
me to write to F E L I X .
Yours faithfully.

Dear J o h n . - Just dropping a line
to let you know that whatever
Sonia may or may not write, or
even if she only thinks it; we
disagree with it.

M i c h M a g h a r
Dear J o h n , - I am glad that my
letter of two weeks ago, of which
the prime purpose was to fill a
quarter page space on page 2 of
F E L I X , has given rise to
correspondence filling half a
page.
F r o m the three letters of last
week it seems that the higher
echelons of the R o y a l College of
Science U n i o n do not themselves
know exactly what they are to do
about the stripper at their
'Revue'.
So may I venture a final
opinion and say that the featuring
o f a stripper might be just slightly
inconsistent with the intention of
putting on a quality revue.
As for Chris Fox, no doubt he
will learn during his year as I C U
President to express himself
accurately and unambiguously,
or he will have trouble not only
with F E L I X reporters.
T o return once again to the
problem of the 'undemocratic
minorities', this concept was only
voiced to me by Chris Fox in
answer to a question about
whether protests by women had
been a factor contributing to the
change in the nature of Smoking
Concert. I did not need to 'divine
Chris' thoughts' as Sean O'Boyle
makes out. I still fail to see how
anyone can construe that Chris
meant any other group than the
women protesters referred to in
the question. If he did then he was
even more inept in his use of the
English language than he makes
out.
However, only R i c h Archer,
Sean O'Boyle and M i c k M a g h a r
claim to explain which other
people Chris meant while Chris
• himself remains silent. As this is
the last F E L I X this term we shall
probably never know.
One more point from M i c k ' s
5.5 inch paragraph, yes I was at
Smoking Concert and 1 thought
that most of the audience was
guilty of disruption and excess
consumption of free beer. But this
is irrelevant to the argument
about undemocratic minorities.
I wish next year's Revue
organisers the best of luck in their
a t t e m p t s to p e r s u a d e the
audience to behave themselves.
Sean claims that R i c h Archer
explained the reasons for the
name 'Highlights Revue', and
then justifies Rich's lack of
explanation by saying that the
name is obvious. Obvious it may
be to you and many others, but
there are people to whom it is not
at all obvious. Saying that it is
obvious does not in any case
constitute an explanation. Not
everyone watches the same
television programmes.
I a m glad that Sean does not
mind people airing their views in
public. It would be a sad day for
the democratic body which he
heads if he did m i n d .
Finally, having livened up your
last few F E L I C E S with a bit of
not too serious correspondence, I
hope everyone has a good summer
and perhaps we shall meet again
some day.
Yours sincerely,
Sonia Hochfelder
P.S. In view of their letter
elsewhere on this page, may I
assure readers that I think R C S L I
is wonderful.
Sir, - I do not recall any response
from IC Executive or Council
having been made on Barrv
Austin's letter in F E L I X No. 520.
Presumably, Council had just
q u i e t l y i g n o r e d the points
contained in that letter! Well, I
for one object to such an attitude,
because an important principle is
involved.
If P a r l i a m e n t passes a
particular Act that happens to be
faulty, the Government has no
power to presume a 'correct'
version of that Act - it has to
introduce a Bill into Parliament
to amend the existing legislation,
thereby removing the mistakes. It
is only after this that the 'correct'
version becomes law.
N o w all this applies, by
analogy, to IC U n i o n . A U G M
may pass a particular policy. This
may include particular mandates
or directives. But for these to have
any effect, they must be phrased
in the correct terms. I C U Council
has no power to take the attitude,
'Well, the U G M really meant
such and such, even though they
didn't actually say that, so that's
what we will do.' If Council are
uncertain, or if they would like a
particular policy of a U G M
altered, then they have to bring
the matter before another U G M ,
which may or may not agree with
them.
Barry Austin is right about the
latest motion on Abortion: I had
already pointed out to several
people including Barry Austin,
(before the motion was discussed),
that, in that form, it could not be
understood as instructing t In-
Executive or Council to do
anything. I had not noticed the
i n t e r n a l inconsistencies that
Barry has pointed out, although
these seem to result from the
amendment. Neither had I
noticed that the policy could not
affect any existing policy, as has
been correctly shown in Barry's
letter. It is no use whatever
C o u n c i l saying that the policy
meant to do these things - if the
proponents of such ideas cannot
find from amongst themselves
articulate, clear-headed persons
capable of drafting a simple little
policy motion, then that'sjust too
bad. The only problem with I C U
is that there is no system like the
courts to restrain C o u n c i l or the
Executive from acting beyond
their proper powers.
I can only hope that the next
Council will not be so blatantly
high-handed as to invent new
powers for itself! If the policy on
the ' N A C ' has been 'deleted' by
this present Council, then it is the
duty of the incoming C o u n c i l to
•overturn such a decision and, on
behalf of their predecessors, to
apologise to the next U G M for
having previously acted ultra
vires ( b e y o n d their p r o p e r
powers).
Yours faithfully,
T o n y Leech,

SCIENCE RESEARCH
COUNCIL:
RESEARCH STUDENTSHIPS
C L E A R I N G H O U S E FOR E N G I N E E R I N G R E S E A R C H
STUDENTSHIPS - 1979
The Council's Engineering Board has been concerned at the low
take-up of its quota research studentships in recent years and new
arrangements are being made for the 1979 awarding exercise to
improve the situation. A clearing house for students seeking
engineering research studentships will operate in the period 11 J u n e -
31 July. There will also be a small reserve of studentships available to
departments that have filled their quota studentship allocations and
have further eligible candidates seeking awards. We hope that this will
help departments achieve a full take-up of their quota allocations.
The normal S R C Appeals procedure will continue to redistribute
unused studentships during August in the first instance in accordance
with Council's general allocation between Science and Engineering. In
previous years the Appeals exercise has been too late for some students
since by then they had made other arrangements - hence the clearing
house exercise this year.
Prospective research students are advised in the first instance to
contact the head of the relevant department to see if quota studentships
are available. In case of difficulty students should telephone the S R C
Engineering Secretariat for details of departments that have unfilled
studentships. This clearing house will operate between 11 June and 31
July 1979, Departments which have difficulty in filling their quotas may
also contact the Engineering Secretariat (Mrs Marion Bird, Swindon
(0793) 26222, Extension 2429) for names of students seeking awards.
There will be a reserve of up to 24 research studentships which may
be applied for on a first come first served basis by departments that have
filled their quota research studentships ie when S R C has received as
many applications for eligible students as allocated. Nominations of
eligible candidates for reserve studentships should be made in the
normal way except that the top of the front page of the application form
must be marked Clearing House Reserve.
Studentships from this reserve will cease to be available after 31 July
1979 when the normal S R C Appeals procedure operates.
These arrangements will apply only to quota research studentships
allocated by the Science Research Concil's Engineering Board; they do
not apply to Case Awards.
