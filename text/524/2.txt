T r e v o r P h i l l i p s states: "Britain
has. for many decades, been an
international centre for posl school
education, particularly attracting
students from the Commonwealth
and former British colonies.
Indeed, many Heads of Government
of Commonwealth countries are ex-
students of British I 'niversilies
themselves. We hold thai it is
essential that overseas students
maintain free and open access lo
British institutions for three major
reasons:

c h a n g e its m i n d o n overseas
students, M r P h i l l i p s said:
"Many people and their families
have devoted their lives lo gaining
ihe initial qualifications and
saving Ihe money necessary for a
place in a British college because
there are no equivalent educational
opportunities in their own
countries.
'' We are not prepared to see the
lives and potential careers of these
people wrecked. The issue we are
raising is of fundamental
importance to Britain. It is not
simply a question o/ people going
hungry or having lo do without
hooks.
Dear Sir. - I a m horrified and
disgusted at the mean-spirited
attitude adopted by the U n i o n
executive on the matter of next
year's F E L I X Editor.
Their ultimatum to. or rather
'dismissal of. J o h n Shuttleworth
c a n o n l y he seen as a
misinterpretation of the facts
surrounding the case. In order for
criteria as to eligibility for a post
to become law. they must be
w r i t t e n i n t o t h e laws o r
c o n s t i t u t i o n o f t h e b o d y
concerned, in this case the Bye-
Laws of I C L nion. T h e criteria,
having become law. must then be
made available to election
candidates and to the electorate
at election times. Since the
criteria about 'good academic
standing' make no appearance in
the Bye-Laws, they were not
available in written form either to
election candidates or to the
electorate in the elections for
F E L I X Editor.
As one of the many voted for
J o h n Shuttleworth in the election,
I would feel cheated if he were to
be removed from the post on some
obscure piece of hearsay of which
I was unaware at the time oi
election. It is rather like the Prime
Minister dismissing an M P from
the House of Commons because
his her private business is not
doing too well.
O f course, the Prime Minister
cannot demand the resignation of
an M P from the House of
Commons (except in cases of
serious misconduct). T h e only
wav to remove an M P is by the
ballot. I mention this analogy
because there is no difference
between the situation described
above and the one regarding next
year's F E L I X Editor. T h e
important point in both cases is
that it is up to the electorate to
decide on a debatable issue and
not the executive. T h e only way
to remove a F E L I X Editor from
Oilice is, according to the Bye-
Laws, by a two-thirds majority at
two L'nion General Meetings.
I hope that the executive will
think again before continuing
their short-sighted policy on this
affair. If they do not. the matter
must surely end up in the law
courts.

COLLEGE
HARDSHIP FUND
At the Governing Body
meeting on the last day of
term it was resolved that no
'on course' students should be
asked to leave if suffering
f r o m g e n u i n e f i n a n c i a l
hardship. A Hardship Fund
was therefore made provision
for.
Though details are still
sketchy, any queries should
be directed to Chris Fox, IC
Union President, int. 3915.

AN OFFICIAL EXEC. STATEMENT
FOLLOWING THE failure of his second year
Mathematics examinations, John
Shuttleworth, who was elected FELIX Editor
last March, was deemed by College not to be
of 'good academic standing'. This means that
he cannot be registered as a student for the
session 1979/80. He is barred from taking up
the Sabbatical by a College Governing Body
regulation, which had been accepted by a
Union General Meeting but had not been
incorporated into the Union Blue Book.
After taking all things into consideration,
including the fact that the Sabbatical is tied to
the FELIX Editorship, Imperial College Union
Executive issued a statement deeming John
Shuttleworth to be ineligible to take up the
post of FELIX Editor, and appointed Colin
Palmer Acting Editor, as he was the runner-
up in the original election.
