FESTIVAL
T h e C a m b r i d g e B e e r F e s t i v a l
the great and thumping success that
everyone knew it would be. The event
was marred only by the lack of
Wadworth's Old Timer and Arkell's
Kingsdowne in the beer hall but this was
almost c o m p e n s a t e d for by the
excellence of certain other brews;
Paine's 'Superstuff and Hoskin's Old
being the most notable. The ale took it's
toll quite early, on certain members of
the IC contingent a n d ' before the
afternoon was out, the C a m had already
claimed a befuddled Steve Gunn (your
new Social Sec.)
PUNTING
The punting (subsidised) proved to be
a welcome diversion from the crowded
beer hall; it would be nice to spend a
whole day lazily punting down the C a m
with a picnic and bottle of wine. Apart
from some heated internal debate about
pole technique (does one punt slowly in
a straight line or does one punt slightly
more quickly at the risk of zig-zagging?)
our punt ended without incident. The
mundane pressures of everyday life
returned, however, with the return of the
punt; there was more drink to be
consumed! This was duly done before
we returned to London on the coach, the
journey back giving rise to one of the
most comic sights I have seen. The
coach stopped by the side of the road for
hordes of people (males) to respond to
'the call of nature' and they each ran to
the nearest available (unoccupied) tree.
Any unsuspecting motorist passing by
must have thought that a new
consciousness for the welfare of the tree
had arisen.
DEP REPS
Onto more serious business; I would
be grateful if all P G Dept Reps could
contact me as I need to compile an up-
to-date list of you. Just write your name
and dept on a piece of paper and send it
to m e c / o Union Office. I hope that all P G
Dept Reps will make a determined effort
to attend P G G r o u p C o m m i t t e e
meetings next year (these will be well
advertised) in order that the group can
fulfil its' role effectively.
NEXT YEAR
Next year's P G Group Committee will
be the following
Chairman/PG Affairs Off. Richard Earl,
Phys P G
Peter Mitchell,
Phys P G
(Int 3867)
Steve Gunn,
Chem P G
(int 4116)
Welfare Off , , , John Whitehouse,
Chem P G
(int. 4162)
The post of Secretary remains unfilled
jand if anyone is interested, 1 would be
Iglad if they c o u l d c o n t a c t me
GRANTS
Any group of P G ' s from a dept. can
claim a grant from the P G Group if they
can prove that the money will be spent to
promote social activities (or any other
type of activity, save political) involving
PG's.
Please contact Peter Mutchell c/o Union
Office if you are interested in a grant.
The well being and effectiveness of
the. Group next year will depend on
YOUR participation. Please make an
effort to attend committee meetings at
which you will be able to put forward
your ideas. Indeed, if you have any ideas
as to what the group should be doing
next year, do not hesitate to send me a
note.
The major issue immediately affecting
most P G ' s is the time taken to do a Ph. D.
and this is an issue at which we will be
looking closely. Also of immediate
interest is the level of overseas students'
tuition fees: 29% increase now with a
projected 100% increase to come! It is
envisaged that a questionnaire will be
sent round to all Ph.D. students in the
early part of the autumn term covering
both these issuees.
We are planning to hold another event
before term starts (probably mid-
September). The exact nature of the
event is not yet known but I have no
doubt that it will be another success
(well, I hope it will be another success!)

NORMA RAE
This is a powerful, moving tale
set in modern day southern
America. Sally Field, in the title
role, gives a very convincing
portrayal of a tough young
woman and her struggle for
freedom. For this performance
she deservedly won the best
actress award at the Cannes Film
Festival this year.
Norma Rae is a widowed
mother whose life centres on the
local cotton mill, a gruesome
collection of clattering machinery
which is the only industry in the
town. Her life changes when she
meets Reuben, a Jewish New
Yorker, who wishes to introduce a
trades union to the mill. He meets
opposition not only from the
management, but also from the
employees with their fears and
prejudices. R o n Leibman, in the
role of Reuben, gave an equally
convincing performance as the
strange man with big ideas and a
lot of drive; a man unlike any
Norma Rae has encountered
before.
Norma marries Sonny (Bean
Bridges) but soon runs into
trouble by over involving herself
with the union. The plot is a little
slow, but this is a deliberate
expression of the reality of the
w h o l e s i t u a t i o n . P a r t i c u l a r l y
impressive are the factory scenes
which reminded me more of the
Victorian era, rather than modern

FILM
REVIEW
pounding of machinery and blank
faces of the almost robotic
workers convey a sense of shame;
do people really work underthese
conditions?
Despite its faults this film is a
m e a n i n g f u l a n d w o r t h w h i l e
experience. Not full of 'thrills and
spills', it effectively blends actors
and scenery to produce an image
of reality; a frightening image.
This is a film to be enjoyed at
leisure.
