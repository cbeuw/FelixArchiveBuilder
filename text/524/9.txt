Review by Colin
Filmed close to Imperial
College, it is a pleasure to
see familiar settings. Of
course you can guess
there are many artistically
directed scenes shot in
doors .... in bed to be
more accurate and in a
convenient swimming
pool.
This film is cool and
sharp. Real Saturday
night entertainment. A
classy comment on
London's night life ... and
guaranteed to add to the
satisfaction of living in
London.
50% ofthe film is based on
