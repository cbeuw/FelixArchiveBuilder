Health Authority stripped of powers
Mr Patrick Jenkin, the Health
Secretary, stripped of their power the 33
members of the London health authority
which has defied Government policy on
N H S cuts.
Lambeth, Southwark and Lewisham
Area Health Authority will be run
indefinitely by a team of special
commissioners. The A H A decided at a
meeting on Monday not to makethecuts
that would be necessary if it were not to
overspend its budget. It is estimated that
about £5.5 millions would need to be cut
as a result of inflation and the V A T
increase and predicted that patients
would die as a result.
Nigerian BP nationalisation
In an apparently unique effort by
Whitehall to save substantial oil rights,
the Foreign Office has instructed the
acting High Commissioner in Lagos, Mr
Frank Kennedy, to take up the matter
with the military government of General
Obasanjo.
The 40,000 tonnes of oil B P took from
Nigeria daily went almost entirely to its
subsidiaries in mainland Europe. Its
sudden disappearance will cut supplies
there by about 15 per cent, unless B P is
able to replace the oil by buying at
higher prices on the free markets, or by
cutting back sales to other oil
companies.

U.S. ban sale of arms to Ulster police
A State Department spokesman said
that a review of American weapons
policy was underway and for the time
being no weapons could be exported for
the R o y a l U l s t e r C o n s t a b u l a r y .
T h e m o v e was p r o m p t e d by
allegations that political detainees have
been mistreated during interrogation.
N o r t h e r n Ireland S e c r e t a r y , Mr
Humphrey Atkins responded by saying
that there was no question of the R U G
being left short of the weapons they
need to fight terrorism.
Morcambe and Wise
A secret TV tribute is being compiled
by the B B C which will be screened when
they retire. The B B C believes that Eric
Morecambe, recovering from major
open-heart surgery, may well leave the
partnership this year.
The two comedians were surprised
when they heard the news of the tribute.
Ernie Wise said, "I'm sure we shall come
back. My understanding is that as soon
as Eric feels up to it we'll be together
again, and I haven't heard anything to
the contrary."
A B B C TV spokesman said that some
preliminary work is being done on
presenting a suitable programme in the
event of Morecambe and Wise giving up
showbusiness.
"It is normal journalistic practice. We
hear that Eric is progressing
satisfactorily and this is one programme
we hope won't go out."

Thatcher avoids Commonwealth split
A serious split at the Commonwealth
Conference was avoided by a speech by
Mrs Thatcher in support of changes in
the Zimbabwe-Rhodesia constitution.
She put forward four points as a basis
for a settlement acceptable to the
African members of the C o m m o n -
wealth. The main point is that the
a m e n d e d Z i m b a b w e - R h o d e s i a
constitution should be comparable with
those agreed with other former colonies.

In a series of operations over eight

Torrential rain stopped play in the
Cornhill Test when England were 72 for
three in reply to India's first innings total
of 96. The water was calf deep near the
boundaries and play was abandoned for
the rest of the day.
Saturday 4th
Russian nuclear disaster confirmed
Confirmation that the Soviet Union
suffered a major accident involving
nuclear waste in late 1957 or early 1958
has come from studies carried out at
Oak R i d g e N a t i o n a l L a b o r a t o r y
in Tennessee.
The accident was first reported by
the exiled Russian scientist Dr Zhores
Medvedev in 1976. The accident laid
waste large areas of territory in the Urals
and caused many deaths.
Gossip columnist to sue proprietor
Nigel Dempster of the Daily Mail is to
take legal action against his proprietor,
Lord Rothermere, who described his
work as having 'the taste of an old, cold
fried potato.'
At his Chelsea mansion, where he
lives with his wife, Lady Camilla
Osborne, daughter of the late Duke of
Leeds, Dempster was adamant that he
intends to see 'justice done'.'At the
moment the Daily Mail needs me more
than I need them .... morale in the office
is low.'

Pound falls
Wholesale prices, which will affect
shop prices within a few months, rose by
2.25 per cent in July. The inflationary
trend hit the pound, which fell by 3 cents
against the dollar.
The figures indicate an underlying
annual inflation rate of 13.5 per cent,
compared with less than twelve per cent
in June - but this is bound to worsen
considerably as the full impact of petrol-
product price rises takes effect and the
increase in VAT is reflected in the index,
possibly putting it up by 3 per cent in
August.
A c r u m b of comfort for the
Government comes from a slight fall - of
1 3/4 per cent - in the prices of non-oil
b a s e d c o m m o d i t i e s b o u g h t by
manufacturing industry - particularly
copper, lead, wood pulp and hides.

Muzorewa insulted
Bishop Muzorewa said it was " an
insult to the electorate and the
government of this country" that new
elections were proposed. Mrs Thatcher
denied that she had sacrificed the
Muzorewa Government to acheive
unanimity at the C o m m o n w e a l t h
conference in Lusaka.
ITV strike
As the c o n s e q u e n c e s of the
commercial television pay dispute, TV
screens went blank over wide areas of
the country.
A battle is going on after the
breakdown of pay negotiations between
the ITV companies and all three unions
who have staff employed, electricians,
technicians and ancillary workers.
San Francisco earthquake
An. earthquake s h o o k a wide
portion of the San Francisco Bay area ,
frightening residents and causing tall
office buildings to sway. There were no

Student resigns from university
A Cambridge graduate is reported to
have made thousands of pounds in
profit by 'borrowing' books from the
university library and then selling them
to London dealers for upwards of
£25,000.
R e s i g n i n g from the university,
though, which involves the expunging of
your name from the records and the
cancelling of all your degrees, is only
available at the would-be resigner's
request.
Even then, it has to be approved by the
university council, whose members
must be convinced that the reasons are
good enough. And until 1974 the step
was actually impossible.
T h i s u n u s u a l protection of a
student's past acheivements, even from
himself, was changed in 1974 during a
suitably bizarre one-man campaign. Mr
Sadar Tejendrasingh, a Cambridge MA
who wapted to end all his links with the
university and with British authorities
generally, broke university windows,
assaulted an administration messenger
and smashed a postal weighing machine
in the Old Schools to promote his cause.

India save test
Centuries by Dilip Vengsarkar and
Gundappa Viswanath, plus delays for
rain, helped India save the second
Cornhill Test against England at Lords.
India needing 323 to stop an innings
defeat, had made 318 for four when play
ended.
Etna eruption

Europe's largest volcano , continued.

Animals sensed quake before it struck
Animals in a safari park near the
epicentre of the moderately strong
earthquake which shook San Francisco
and northern C a l i f o r n i a behaved
erratically for hours before the tremors
were felt by people.
Their behaviour, observed by many
full-time keepers and trainers, supports
the belief that animals are sensitive to
seismic activity.
The park's spokeswoman said that a
cougar had been very restless and
padded about most of the night, while a
baby tiger- "normally very nice" - had
remained curled up in a corner all day,
refusing to r e s p o n d to friendly
approaches.
"Then about five minutes before the
earthquake occurred, one of our trainers
was trying to trim the toenail of an
elephant, but the elephant wouldn't let
him do it," she said.
"Normally the elephant is very
gentle. It went back and banged the door
around and began trumpeting when the
quake occurred."
Other animals grouped with their
own kind during the earthquake-Zebras
with Zebras, deer with deer and so on,
and they all remained standing up
during the jolting.
"Half an hour afterwards everything
was back to normal as though nothing
had happened."
