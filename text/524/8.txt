R A T I N G S
225-150: Professional bachelor,
rake, Casanova etc - doomed to
be lonely to old age if he doesn't
watch out. Likes his liquor
straight, his cars and women fast.
Not to be trusted. Dynamite to the
weakeroftheweakersex-well left
alone.
150 - 50: Dangerous, unbeatably
a t t r a c t i v e , u n b e l e i v a b l y i n -
telligent, unutterably charming,
all male - so he tells you. Also
unbearably conceited. Improves
with old age, specially if left in
cold storage.
0 and neighbourhood: The golden
mean No more need be said!
-50 - -205: Completely dom-
esticated, will not cause any
trouble. No worry about a wolf in
sheep's clothing here.
