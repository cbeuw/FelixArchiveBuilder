A FILM FOR ENVIRONMENTAL WEEK
" T H E C H I N A S Y N D R O M E "
by Mark Smith
Whenever you tuck a switch to
turn on a light, do you think of the
possible consequences of what
you are doing? This is the
question posed to us all, indirectly
, in this interesting nuclear power
thriller which is released to day.
The title refers to a term once
coined for the melt-down of a
nuclear reactor. The plot thus
c e n t r e s o n the a c c i d e n t a l
discovery by a TV news team of a
near disaster at an atomic power
station. Kimberly Wells (Jane
Fonda) is an ambitious news
r e p o r t e r c a u g h t b e t w e e n
revealing the cover-up of the
accident and losing her job, or
a c c e p t i n g t h e s p e r f i c i a l
assurances of the plant's public
relations officer. Her cameraman,
played by producer Michael
Douglas, is convinced that the
public should be told.
Jane Fonda & Michael Douglas plan their next shot in ihe nuclear potter plant.
A brilliant performance from Jack Lemmon
starring as Jack Godell.
Further complications arise; the
big business interests which built
the power station are seeking a
licence for another and cannot
afford expensive safety checks or
any bad publicity. They resort to
vioence to keep the story secret
and push for the plant to be put
back 'on line' as soon as possible,
thus saving money and their
reputation.
Jack. Lemmon plays a senior
engineer, Jack Godell, who is
suspicious about the whole
incident. His subsequent dealings
with both TV crew and company
provide the basis for the rest of
this interesting and topical movie.
Lemmon gives an extremely

convincing performance in an
unlikely role for him, displaying
his great flexibility as an actor.
T h e fj|m raises several
interesting questions, especially
for scientists. Can we afford a
nuclear programme in which
financial matters rather than
safety could possibly be of
premier importance? Are the
public aware that switching on
that light gives them a form of
responsibility and should they
therefore be better informed?
This drama, although decidedly
a n t i - n u c l e a r , gives no firm
answers and centres more on the

emotional states of the people
involved. I can only recommend it
as a welcome escape from the
batch of sci-fi cowboys and
Indians currently with us. It
contains some fine performances
and can at least be taken
seriously.
F i n a l l y , w i t h o u r o w n
Environmental Week soon to
come, this film would provide an
interesting night out - especially if
you get bored with the arguments
and debates at college!
