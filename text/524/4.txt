The Beit Quad facelift has begun. Even
the clock that has, for months, shown the
time of 12:45 is likely to be restored to full
working order. Thousands of pounds
will be spent on up-grading the quad. A
large section is being paved over but
there will still be some areas of grass.
Students and visitors seeing the
development of the new quad emerging
from the remains of the old are puzzled
why there needed to be a change.
Tomb stones and coffins! Is the quad
being converted into a place of rest? Beit
Quad is the location of many traditional
events including the pancake race
(when the quad is watered by fire hoses)
and the exec torture (euuch!). The
expensive quad will be initiated regularly
by substances, other than rain water, in
the autumn.
