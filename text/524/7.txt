HAMLET
at the Old Vic
This production of Hamlet
with Derek J a c o b i in the title role
for the second time, is heading for
a well deserved international tour
including Elsinore itself, Greece,
China, Japan and Australia. Very
little was cut from this superb
production making it a long but
enjoyable evening despite the
c r a m p e d c o n d i t i o n s i n an
otherwise fine old theatre, the set
was very simple; the scenery
consisting only of two portraits,
one of old Hamlet and one of
Claudius, so that a continuous
comparison could be made by the
audience and effective use made
by the characters, Hamlet in
particular. This gave a very
Shakespearean atmosphere with
costumed stage hands employed
in moving the major props
between scenes.
A n o r i g i n a l b e g i n n i n g
introduced us to the four major
charactersmoving across the
smokey stage and highlighted in
pairs and singly in spotlights. This
promised a well produced and
interesting performance: we were
not disappointed. Lighting and
music were both used to good
effect, particularly on the castle
battlements where the ghost's
presence was indicated by the
mournful notes of a flute. One
musician who stood out was
guitarist Alan Lawrence, amongst
the players who accompanied the
H e c u b a s p e e c h a n d t h e
"Mousetrap" play— an
unfortunate name considering
Agahtha Christie's long runner,
which raised a titter from the
audience.
Derek Jacobi gave a brilliant
performance (surprise, surprise!)
a s e x p e c t e d f r o m t h i s
experienced actor although I felt
that his mad fit following his
meeting with the ghost was rather
overdone with Jacobi rolling on
the stage in an imitation of a
childish tantrum. This is the only
criticism I had and it was forgotten
after the famous "To be or not to
be" soliloquy and the following
speech with Ophelia which was in
my opinion the best scene of the
night.
Robert Eddison, as Polonius,
a l s o g a v e an o u t s t a n d i n g
performance with just the right
amount of self—opinionation to
provide humourinthistragicplay.
The only major criticism of
the play was the characterisation
of Gertrude, played by Brenda
Bruce, who did not show as much
affection towards Hamlet as was
e x p e c t e d , a l t h o u g h h e r
performance was up t o < the
standard expected at the Old Vic.
Altogether, we both enjoyed
our first oppurtunity to review,
although we had a momentary
worry following Laetes and
Ophelia's passionate embrace on
stage — is incest contagious?

time waits for no one - in a way
this reminds me of how the two

ark float away: b e h i n d an
incredibly badly designed new-
wave-canh-in-a Hempt-at-street-
credibility/notoriety-and-today-
relevance cover lurks very little at
all apart from a further attempt by
'living legends' at a fast buck - the

conforms - with the possible
exceptions of 'fool to cry' and the
live 'if you can't rock me / get off
my cloud', bluntly it sucks:
posterity will hardly be kind to this
'record' - the validity is minimal -
which is fairly lucky as it almost
perfectly matches the musical
content : add to jagger has never
sung worse - ok, maybe 'way back
when' the stones were a 'force to
be reckoned with' - not authology

As a complete contrast, this
album is fun, varied, interesting,
and can even be listened to right
through. (Latest score Neon
Hearts 4, Rolling Stones 0). Neon
Hearts are a new band, this being
their first album. They play music
a couple of inches outside the
Rezillos, sort of poppy, avarte-
garde, new wave whatever that
might be.
T h e v o c a l i s t , T o n e D i a l ,
('honest officer its me real name')
sounds like a more adventurous,
and more powerful Robin Scott
('M' you ignorant —'s). Keith
Allen, drums, and Steve Heart,
sax, are the other heroes. Paul
Raven, bass, performs some-
where between solid and inspired,
and Martin Ratcliffe, guitar, never
lets the side down, giving an
overall impression of tightness
and originality. The production
seems very rough, but it is always
appropriate (Neon Hearts 8
Rolling Stones 0).
So! an excellent album from the
tasteful pink and black cover to
the essential little round hole in
the middle. Best tracks? Irrelevant
(Neon Hearts 10 Rolling Stones

A l b u m Review
The L o n d o n Concert"
by Dave J a g o
One of the reasons that Oscar
Peterson's playing has never
particularly appealed to me is that
he seems to play with a complete
lack of emotion. The impression
has been fueled by watching him
playing happily away to an
enthusiastic audience in the
safety and comfort of his own
television chat show. It is a well
k n o w n f a c t , a m o n g s t w e
traditionalists at least, that the
best jazz can only be played by
pennyless, homeless, unloved
('My baby done left me ...') down
and outs, preferably on the verge
of catching pneumonia or going
insane. On this double album,
however, recorded live at the
Royal Festival Hall last year,
Peterson quite excells himself,
playing with a surprising fire and
passion.
Having said that, perhaps I had
better make it clear that this is not
just a record of Oscar Peterson
accompanied by bass and drums,
but of a trio in the proper sense of
the word. All three instruments
take an equally important part in
the proceedings. Louis Bellson,
on drums, is known to many
through his work with big bands,
although he is in fact no stranger
to small group playing. His
d r u m m i n g is a l w a y s w e l l
considered, and his short solo
spots manage to be totally
stunning, whilst remaining fully
integrated within the musical
context. The drum choruses in
'Sweet Georgia Brown' have to be
heard to be believed - no boring
extended ego trips here!
John Heard, on bass, produces
a much grittier, and to my mind
better, tone than does Nick
Peterson, who is Petersons
regular bass player. Heard's
bouncy, angular style matches
the fluancy of the piano lines
beautifully. Peterson himself, of
course, plays with sheer technical
genius. The rendition of 'Sweet
Georgia Brown,' one of the stand-
out tracks on the album, is
nothing short of incredible, and
the ease with which he changes
from style to style, bouncing from
stride into bebop in the space of a
few s e c o n d s , is s o m e t i m e s
breathtaking.
