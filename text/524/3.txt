"Quadrophenia" deals with a
group of Mods over a period of ten
days and the attempt by the central
character, Jimmy (Phil Daniels), to
establish his Identity.
In trying to find himself he has
to overcome many pressures. He
rejects his family, his work and his
old friends and joins the Mods
hoping to find an identity amongst
his new mates. But he comes up
against an entirely new set of
pressures.
Directed by Frank Roddam,
produced by Roy Baird and Bill
Curbishly with THE WHO as
Executive Producers.
I was expecting a good film but
this was so brilliant that I will not be
able review it in the normal
manner. "Quadrophenia" is a film
that should not be talked about but
it should be experienced as soon
as you can find time to go along to
the Plaza 2. Although I have only
just seen it at a preview theatre, I
intend to experience its powerful
imagery next week. It is a film to be
seen again and again. Anytime you
feel low the film will take you back
to the emotive sixties and away
from the sophisticated seventies.
Never before has a film had such an
indescribable impact on me.
"Quadrophenia" opens on
August 16th at the Plaza 2, Lower
Regent Street.
