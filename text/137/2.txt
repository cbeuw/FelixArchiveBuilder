Ian Planner came to Imperial College
four years ago and in that time he has
suooeeded i n getting a degree as well as
devoting a great deal of time to Union
Activities. These inolude being Hon.
Secretary of the R.S.M. Union last year
During this last session he has indicated
that he w i l l be following the example
set by Lea Allen of marrying into I.C.W.A.
We congratulate him on his engagement
to last years Wornens Association Hon.
Secretary, Miss Ann-Margret Radford,
Ian does not find his spare time
enjoyment on the sports f i e l d although
he has been known to turn out for the
R.S.M. at rugger or even i n the asrmal
Cross Country raoe between the constit-
uent Colleges. His principal pass
time i s photography and he was one of
the 1
9
5
9 I.C. team whose entry won the
European Universities Photographic
Competition. As a reward for this he
has the somewhat dubious prlvilge
organising the next competition at I.C.
In conclusion i t i s perhaps fitting
to point out that Ian was the f i r s t
Business Manager of Felix to record a
profit for many years. We hope that
he w i l l succeed i n doing the same for
the Union during the coming year.
THE BIG SQUIRT
We gents have got a bigger aquirt,
We've always grovelled i n the dirt
To drink the stupid l i t t l e squirt
But now we've got a bigger squirt.
I told old Dan some terms ago
But he just laughed at me and so
My nose grew like i t didn't ought'a
o-wause you see I like my water.
So may I praise the plumber who
Adjusted some well hidden screw.
My reader - careful.' Don't be pushful
Or alas you'll find you've got a muahful.
Roger Jefferyea.
P.G. Elect! ENGi.

THE
T O W N
For those ardent heros, who are
prepared to s i t in the twenty sixth
row of the gallery, who are willing to
be kneed and knudged by nonchalant
nightingales and who have the w i l l power
to resist replying to such tempting
utterances as, "Cor! it's a b i t slow
ain't i t luv,* from Battersea back-
room boys, and "Eeh lass, I shouldn'ta
brought you i t I koew't sax was going
to be mentioned", a l l from the twenty
seventh row of the gallery, then the
bright and brassy lights of limbo,
the West End, offers a very fine selec-
tion of serious drama, light enter-
tainments and films.
The really interested theatre-
goer w i l l find a host of recent
productions which are worth a good deal
of consideration. "The Hostage",
.a play by the now infamous Brendan
Beaan and produced by the 'Theatre
Workshop', along with Michael Redgrave's
adaptation of Henrv Jame's novel, now
known as "The Aspem Papers" produced
at the Queen's Theatre are both plays '
which should not be missed. In the
same category perhaps as Graham Greene's
"The Complaisant Lover", although I
doubt whether Greene the dramatist i s ,
as yet, as mature as Greene the novelist.
Sean 0'Casey's "Cook-A-Doodl«
Dandy" at the Royal Court Theatre i s ,
without a doubt, I think, the top-
line production of the day. Described
by himself, as his favourite play, i t
is a performance which, anyone remotely
interested i n the history of the
theatre, should not f a i l to see.
If your personal choice i s mare i a
the realm of light-comedy, then, I aa
advised, the revue "Pieces of Eight"
at the Appollo Theatre i s far you. It
is a return to a rather more sophis-
ticated style of production, something
which I'm afraid has been sadly lacking
far some time. Pater Cook's sketches,
the music of Lanrioe Johnson and Faddy
Stares slick production a l l help to make
a very fine show.
Going to the cinema? Well here
again there are fine things to be seen,
besides that couple who always ween
ardent upon demonstrating their lawa
immediately i a front of you.
I have no personal knowledge, but
I have been told that amusement of a
nature to satisfy everyone from senti-
mentalist to sadist, i s offered by such
films as, "The Lavender H i l l Mob* at
the Classic, "I'm alright Jack" starring
Peter Sellers, Isa Carwdahael and Terry
Thomas at Studio One, and "The M
a
m
m
y
"
X at the London Pavillicn, although I'a
sane that by now you w i l l a l l have seen
"pretty l i t t l e posters* announcing the
Walt Disney's, "Sleeping Beauty"
at the Astoria, said to be Disney at
his peak i s a film which people interes-
ted in the art of film cartoon must see.
It i s f u l l of charm, end i n its way,
rather beautiful.
Besides these few, there are of
course many more plays and films whioh
one ought to see, perhaps time and
money are the deciding factors.

GENERAL ELECTION
This must surely have been one
of the quietest General Election at I.C,
in the history of the College. Apart
for an informal discussion of the party
manifestoes by the politically minded
members, and that i l l attended "Hustings
in the concert hall, there was l i t t l e 01
no activity at College to indicate that
anything out of the ordinary was
happening (the reason was of course the
proximity of polling day to the
beginning of term]; no news meeting
and no raga except for a small group of
Guildsmeh who alternated between
Trafalgar Square and Piccadilly Circus.
The only spark of real interest waa
shown on Friday, when the lounge was
crowded to watch the one-eyed monster
showing the results.
'
A
'
a
e this due to a party, or
to a feeling that an Election waa too
serious a matter for old-fashioned
student pranks!
Probably the latter,* but i t
seems a pity that the time ia apparently
past when a man might look back with
nostalgia on his student days as the
days of his gay and wild youth. There
ia much to be said for the old idea of
sowing ones wild oats when s t i l l young.
FRESHERS HOP
The combined I.C.-Bedford
Hop held i n the Union on October 9th
provided no startling innovations, but
traversed the well trodden paths with a
fair amount of gusto. It seemed that
this year there was a rather large
proportion of actual I.C. freahera
present which probably accounted for the
diversity of male dress, ranging from
suits to open necked ehirta (via the
national costume of Southern Mongolia -
postgrad I presume.') The large body
of men which invariably atanda at one
end of the Hall, preferring to watch
rather than dance, waa once again present
this was no doubt disappointing for the
many young ladies sitting round the floor
(on chairs).
After the interval the band,
fortified by aoa» beer, and having found
a missing red-hti.red trumpeter, gave vent
to a lively series of quicksteps, sambas,
Cha-cha-chae and other international
"gyrations. The President of Guilds ,
obviously of the opinion that things were
not moving fast enough organised a
apirited Paul Jones punctuated by
vigorous cries of "Ladies to the right"
etc:. The evening closed on the cust-
omary somnolent note, couples dancing
to a dreamy waltz tune i n a*aiaily-lit
Hall.
CEREAL
Breakfast i s exhausting these days,
by the time you've found the toy i n the
cereal packet, unwrapped i t , put i t
together and played with i t , i t s tine
for dinner. - L.A.
