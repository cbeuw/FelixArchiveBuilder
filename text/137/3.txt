The, J.H. Collins Saga,
Joan Collins i s one of the cat-
standing long distance runners to bo
produced by I . C . Ho has run
brilliantly and consistently over track,
road and country alike but professes
a preference for the country where
•middy conditions suit his style best. •

John nails from Aylesbury, and
learned his running at the age of
3-4 fran nearby ducks. He joined the
I . C . olub i n 1955 when s t i l l classed
as a youth. As a result of his London
experience he returned home to win the
Bucks. County Youths t i t l e easily.
John was 3rd i n the U.L. champs,
i n the last two years, and i s the favour-
i t e to win the t i t l e this year, despite
the faot that this race i s run over a
distance whioh i s a l i t t l e too short for
him. Last year he wan the S.W.E.T.C.
trophy race for the second successive
time. He won the Q.M.C. race and the
Orion '15! last year, but was runner
up to the former international J ask
Heywood i n the farmer this year. In
inter, college races John has a long and
baring l i s t of victories and t i t l e s .
On the track he was third i a the
Bucks 6 miles this year and has a best
time of 30 min.53 sec. He was third
in the Aylesbury olub champs one mile
in A

:
?
8 and second i n the 880 in
2:3>4 - a distance far too short for
him!
We a l l look for the day when John
i s an established marathon runner,
he made a start this year by finishing
9th i n the Bernie Barnes "Semi Marathon"
at an average rate of 5j min. per mile.
John oan hardly be termed a
conventional athlete. On the night
prior to running he i s usually to be seen
indulging i n his other hobbies, and
always runs his best races for U.L.
after carnival nights.
As a member of R.C.S. his academic
background i s now tinted with a B.So.
and he i s now working for an M.So. i n
rook magnetism.
Last year John was n of
A.C.C and this year he i s a member of
the I.C. Council

His 'chief likes' are beer, women,
the Liberal party and marathons. Chief
dislikes; psvaioB, Sunday morning
training and — y L j glasses.
I should t e l l you about my
twenty-one years, of my leaving Tiffin
School i n 1956 as House Captain, Open
Scholar and Henley oarsman, my success-
ful year ae salesman, milkman, farm
labourer and apple picker before I
turned for variety, to R.C.S. This
should be told to the literary
accompaniment of amusing anecdotes of
the author as a young prig. I should
throw i n for good measure the reasons
for my taking critical decisions
moulded by reading the Kinsey Report
during puberty. However I prefer not
to talk such crap.
This jarring word ia an
Americanism and illustrates the effect-
iveness of using American hair-raisers
in our drawing-room King's English as
a tool against cuckoos and humbugs;
although the tool is stolen from a
Utopia of cuckoos and humbugs. I
cannot explain this anomaly but will
not be joining the march to Aldermaston
rain or no rain.
People faced with a camera or
a tape-recorder cannot be at ease and
similarly an untrained writer cannot be
at ease when putting hie personality on
paper. I have never published anything
until I have stored i t for some months
and then reread i t . This hasenaured
that nothing I have written haa ev«r,
appeared before the public. It is
true that onea wine improves with
keeping but onea writing becomes
unbearable after some time. In fact
this ia the wpy of t e l l i n p the differ-
between wine and writing.
It i s unfortunate that my
pen's maiden publication has not been
exposed on the hillside at birth ae have
i t s other offspring. This i s the
fault of the.Editor of Felix who, like
an eccentric Emperor of decaying Rome,
deplores the barrenness of the Imperial
Family. The only obvious distinction
is that the Editor of Felix i s asexual
and confines his distaste to his friend-
pens who boast sterility.
Incidentally those who apprec-
iate the position of an editor of Felix
will agree that his asexual!ty ia
essential for his task aa impartial
ahairman between good and evil or
synonymously, for thoee uninfluenced by
the doctrines of Lord Baden-Powell
discretely clad i n long trousers, more
suitable for the S.W. climate and
accepting the fashionable self
cozufciouaaees associated with bare knees
for his task to mediate between I.C.W.A.
and I.C.M.A.
Now, my f i r s t year i n the oppres-
sive atmosphere of the main R.C.S.
building under the strain of my
academic ambitions and the intensive
Chemiatry courae was so soul deetroying
that-only the purchase of a brightly
checked jacket and a copy of John
Betjeman's poems for the folks saved me.
I was so grateful for my salvation that
I passed my repeats with distinction.
Knowing from reliable aourcea,
mother, that shame ia pitifully 8 h o r t
lived, I realiaed the memory of my
aummer failure would give l i t t l e driving
force, f o r my,second session. I wae
deaperate, I confided to a friend. I f
only I myaelf couLA acquire that perfect
balance, that aense of proportion that
ia only known i n ex-National Servicemen
and kindergarten school teachera.
So I plunged myself f u l l y into
other a c t i v i t i e e and my l i f e became one
glorious build up to my writing a F e l i x
P r o f i l e . My t i p t o e to the top had
begun.
Last paragraphlesa, I grind
l i k e my o l d frequently petrolleas
Armstrong Siddeley to a halt only to
s p l u t t e r a heart paining raeaeage.
Note that the compariaon dies a l u d i -
croda death here becauae the car'a
usual trouble i s d i r t i n the carbur-
etter. BE GENTLEMEN, REMAIN GENTLE-
WOMEN.

Comment by my friend and
fellow philosopher, Les A l l e n , who haa
promised to make a better job of my
obituary than I w i l l s
"This Forster as w r i t t e n by
JOHN PROFILE expresses f a r more c l e a r l y
his true character than a platitudinous
l i s t of d e s c r i p t i v e phrases r e f e r r i n g
to h i s background and i n t e r e s t s .
Here we have the true FORSTSR;
incoherent, bumbling, and struggling i n
this wicked modern'world to express
himself and communicate with h i s fellow
human bainga. He f a i l e miserably"."
