BASKET BALL
After a year f i l l e d with unpre-
aedentod suooesa, the I.C. team hare a
very f u l l programme arranged for the
ooming season. Sinoe other colleges
â€¢ould not rival the supremacy of the
COLLEGE, to find suitable opposition we
lave Joined the First Division of the
London Basketball League and w i l l be
playing some of the finest loams i n the
country, as a result.
With this greatly extended l i s t
of fixtures the need for rejuvenation
by Freshmem is painfully apparent. A
Freshers t r i a l w i l l be held i n the Gym-
nasium on Thursday 22nd. Although
previous experience i s a needed essential
for freshmen hoping to make the f i r s t
team, men with l i t t l e or no experienoe
v i l l have the opportunity of learning X
the game and receiving expert tuition
from the College coach.
SOCCER
On Freshers Day, with 50 fresh-
men indicating an intention to play
soccer, the soccer club, with an antici-
pated 40 "Old lags* returning were
reasonably confident of a.successful
season and of maintaining the high
a t a n d a r d 8 attained last year. This
hope was further strengthened by the
fact that a l l last year's University
players have returned, and by the
encouraging standard of' the freshers at
the t r i a l on Wednesday.
With the f i r s t round of the
Jniversity Cup only one week after the
trials only a minimum amount of time i s
available for picking a lst XI and
getting them match f i t . This made the
freahera trials on Wednesday, and the
combined freshers old lags t r i a l on
3aturday a l l the more important. The
former of these waa played on a very
dry hard ground which made the ball
very lively and difficult to control.
However the freshers gave a good account
of themselves, although i n most cases by
no moans f i t . The trials on Saturday'
were played in quite different
conditions with the ball tending to skid
on the wet ground, which never the less
remained hard. These trials" were
correspondingly disappointing with
only sufficient support to make 2 gamea
possible, whilst 4 games had been
anticipated. This lack of support was
presumably due to the rain, although
thie could by no means be described as
heavy. Better support ia required i f
7 XI'a are to be run satisfactorily,

' weather aa well aa fine.
The f i r s t gamea will be playea
on Wednesday, (before this report i s
published) some friendly and some
league, and i t is hoped that- a l l
participating will have had an enjoyable
game even i f not successful.
P.S. Training sessions every
Tuesday and Thursday lunchtimes i n the
park. Meet i n the'gym at 12. JO p.m.
These are moat enjoyaole except when
organised by the captain!'
S P O R T
Las^ year the club had a
moderately successful season
registering victories over Oxford (once)
and Sandhurst (three times), and
Buffering only one defeat at the hands
of an exceptionally strong Cambridge
team. The college was well represented
in the university fixtures, three of our
members being chosen for the London
university teams and also for the South
East regional team. Even i f the trio
did not perform too brilliantly for the
London team, they did however acquit '
themselves well in the drinking which
followed.
This year our secretary John
Shepherd lst Kyu, has arranged an
extensive programme of matches includ-
ing contests with Sandhurst and Solds-
miths, and a rather more exacting' fight
with the Metropolitan Police Force. I
would like to take this opportunity of
appealihg to the college to please allow
the police team to reach the gymnasium
unmolested as we wish to have a go at
them f i r s t .
For people interested i n
starting judo we are holding meetings
on Wednesday evenings at 6 o'clock when
we hope to demonstrate aome of the
fundamental principles, such aa the art
of breakfalling and some of the basic
throws. If you are interested why not
come along on Wednesday evenings and be
secure i n the knowledge that you will
be able to defend yourself at a l l times,
whenever you are f i t enough to go out.
TABLE TENNIS
Table tennis enthusiasts will
have noticed that no representative of
the club was present at the Fresher's
Reception. This lamentable absence
was caused by the academic demise
of the captain sleet At the moment
the club i s a democracy but trials sre
shortly to be held and new officers
will be elected by the people when the
time i s ripe.
See the club notice board i n
the Table Tennis room on the top floor
of the Union for details of membership
etci, and help to give the club i t s
best season yet.
I CROSS COTJKxSX CLUB
At the Freshers' Reception this
year about 20 Freshmen indicated their
interest i n the Club. Of these 9 -took
part i n a t r i a l on Wednesday 7th over
the Read Relay CfJorse i n Hyde Park
accompanied by 18 old lags. For these
stalwarts who survived the rigours of
the afternoon, as well as the climb
to the seventh floor of Weeks Hall,
there was the reward of coffee and
biscuits kindly provided by our cap-
tain, Alan Brown.
On Saturday 10th three intrepid
freshers and nine old lags ran 6 miles
on Hampstead Heath i n the University
Trials. Good performances were put
up by veterans, J.H. Collins and M.S.
Barber who came 3rd and 5th respectively
closely followed by J.D.T. Bernard (7th)
Last, but by no means least, of the
I.C. contingent was fresher Dave Rymer
who, being an ex-naval bod, was a b i t
weak on his navigation and went off
course.
On a regular 2 year cycle between
I.C. and N.E.C. the Club welcomes back
John Conway whom we a l l hope to see
regularly at our future fixtures.
Another old timer with whom many of the
present members are unfamiliar is Eddie
Bennett who returns to run for the Club
and study for a postgraduate degree i n
his spare time.
Finally, to those freshers who have
yet to discover the Club's notloe board,
they should enter, the Union building from
the quae v i a tne door i n the right
hand corner and then pass through the
double doors cn the right when they
w i l l find the board on the right hand
wall.
RUGBX
Nearly 100 freshers were welcomed
this year by the Rugby Club and a very
successful season i s anticipated i f the
enthusiasm now apparent remains through
out the winter. We are hoping to run
seven regular teams as the fixture card
is devised to give exceptionally, varied
games to seven Saturday XVs.
The Club owing to this seasons early
fixtures were only able to devote one
Wednesday to trials instead of the cus-
tomary two day trials. It w i l l be there
fore understood that last Saturday's games
were very experimental. I.C. teams f i g -
ured i n 6 matches, 4 of them including
the 1st and 2nd were hosts at Harlington.
Although seven I.C. players were holding
together the University side, the 1st XV
.lead by M. Bregazsi s t i l l enjoyed a pro-
mising start to the season i n winning
out over a much improved Charing Cross
Hospital side by 17 points to 0. The
2nd XII fought and even tougher battle
against N.P.L. and was narrowly defeated
by 3 points to 0. The other teams had
mixed suocess but did well considering
the difficulties of selection at this
stage of the season.
Last Tuesday the Club gave new a
members an informal welcome when i t
was addressed by Professor Sparkes
its President and other eminent m
e
m
-
bers of the Rugby world. members
who weren't prese t missed an enjoy-
able evening.
