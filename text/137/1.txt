Although the ground floor -.
room was unfinished, the strategical
positioning of a few potted plants and
furnishings did manage to hide the wet
plaster and drying mortar.
The Rector, Sir Patrick Linatead
speaking f i r s t , welcomed the assembled
guests who included Directors and
representatives of Viokera Limited and
Associated Group companies, members of
the College staff and a few strangely
dressed students. (The President
later disclosed to the editor that he
had hired the suit from a reputable firm
down the Portobello Road.1
) His
expression that"rush-hour travel was no
substitute for dreaming spires" was
heartily reiterated by the assembly.
He went on to say that even "Brick and
Mortar" were not enough, the spirit of
comradeship waa essential. He ended
by extending bouquets to the people who
had helped i n making Weeks Hall a
realisation. Our condolences to
Mr. Liddeil, the site manager, who
according to the Rector lost a stone i n
weight and had several sleepless nights
prior to the opening.
Lord Khollys, a commanding figure of a
man, then formally opened the hall.
During his speech he emphasised the
fact that industry had stepped i n and
A plaque commemorating the occasion
has been erected at the entrance to the
Hall.
Weeks Hall i s eleven storeys, with
common rooms only at ground-floor level
and the warden's flat at the top. As
is tradition i n universities, the warden
and deputy warden arc full-time members
of the academic staff.
The opening of Weeks Hall marks the
completion of the first stage of the
College's scheme for the development of
Prince's Gardens as a residential and
social precinct. For this purpose,
properties on the north, east and south
sides of the Gardens were acquired by
the College i n 1956.
Early i n 1957, Viokera - as part of
their long-term programme of support for
education i n engineering subjects -
offered to provide a number of scholar-
ships for undergraduate apprentices and
a benefaction of Â£150,000 for a new Hall
of Residence, i n whioh holders of suoh
awards oould live i n term-time with
other students of the College.
This generous offer was .gratefully
accepted by the College and the Hall was
built i n the north-east corner of the
Gardens. Weeks Hall, as i t has been
named, was designed by Richard Sheppard,
Robson and Partners (the architects for
the Prince's Gardens Scheme) and,
although conforming to the general plans
for the remainder to the area, will
possess an identity of i t s own within,
the oomplete development. This identity
springs from the faot that i t has been
planned to meet a dual purpose. As well
as being a normal College Hall of Resi-
dence during the aoaderaio year, i t w i l l
also provide the venue i n the Easter and
Summer vacations for educational and
staff conferences of the Vickers organ-
isations.
The building i s designed of r e i n -
forced concrete cross walls supporting
pre-stressed concrete floors, so there
On each floor a se-s of eight study-
bedrooms has i t s own bathroom, shower,
and galley, with a minute kitchen cabi-
net for each student. The uninstitu-
tional a i r of comfort i s partly due to
the quiet cork floors, but chiefly to
the determination and s k i l l of the
architect.
Most of the study bedrooms have
a coloured wall, and these are intended
to be seen as a bright motley from the
street. Unfortunately none but the
dark brown i s rich enough to be success-
ful, and i t i s possible to miss this
feature altogether.
The colour of this building does
not quite match up to the architectural
farm, once one acknowledges the superb
grey of the steelwork. To preserve
the cellular character of the elevations
the concrete panel below the windows has
been faced with a lighter aggregate
than the structure. The difference i n
tone is far too slight and robs the
facade of definition.
