CIRCUIT TRAINING
For the past f a * years, Circuit
Training - a new farm of progressive
training for physical fitness - has Veen
arousing interest i n this country and over-
seas. The possession of a healthy body
is a prime necessity i n this modern age
i f we are not to break down under the
strain of living, and this i s especially
true i n the case of the hard-working
student. The ideal: 'Mens sana i n
corpora sano' i s too often forgotten.
Circuit Training (C,T.) meets this need
in the physical education of students,
and was i n fact evolved i n the gym of
the University of Leeds.
It i s a medical faot that the best
way of developing a healthy muscle i s to
exercise against an ever-increasing re-
sistance, and there is not better way of
doing this than weight training, increa-
sing the number of repetitions performed,
or steadily increasing the poundage used.
The bar bell system i s ideal, since the
weight oan be easily adjusted by as
l i t t l e as i lb. at a time.
Weight training i s now used as a
basic training for a l l sports. Ex-
ample's of sportsmen who claim that their
suooess i s largely due to regular doses
of "iron p i l l s " oan be found everywhere.
Famous athletes include Chris Brasher,
Cordon Pirie, Brian Shenton, John Savage,
Pharoah, Ian Anthony, Emil Zatopeck, etc.
The athlete who does not use weights i s
the unusual type. Swimmers like Mike
Breoknell train regularly with weights,
as do cyclists Reg. Harris, Dave Bedwell,
Cyril Peacook. Many f i r s t division
Soccer teams include weights i n their
training schedules ... Rugger ..
Rowing .. Need we' continue? For the
benefit of the I.C. Musical Soo. Guy
Mitchell is a regular weight trainer as
well.
Weight training is used as a means
of physical culture (body-building tech-
niques used to build the physique to the
best size and strength) as a sport i n
its own right (weight lifting) and i s
also extensively used aa a remedial
treatment (rehabilitation). The im-
provements possible are very rapid and
have to be seen to be believed. (Not

BADMINTON CLUB
Inconsistency and lack of co-
ordination was the key note of last
seasons activities and consequently
our record mas not at a l l good. The
seoond team had the best record and
if n mare than half their matches,
the first VI had a poor season and should
have been relegated into the 2nd
division of the league. However, this
would have made the 2nd division very
overcrowded and were allowed to retain
one team i n the premier division.
The mixed team also met with l i t t l e
suooess i n their endeavours though we
gather they managed to thoroughly
enjoy their games. We have an except-
ional number of Freshers this year,
about 70 people having shown an inter-
est i n the Club. At the moment we
do not quite know how to accommodate
a l l these people on our court i n the
gym, but we hope to obtain more court
space i n the near future.
The amount of talent i n the Club
promises a good season provided every-
one pulls his weight and keeps an eye
an the Club Notioe Board so that he
can keep ahreat of the Club affairs.
usually quite as quickly as Ch-rl-s
Atl-o promises, though!) The fourth
use of barbells i s the comparatively
recent one of C.T.
At present the circuit is open i n
the Snack Bar every evening at 5.0 p.m.
or 5.3° on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I f
you are interested, please come down one
evening and have a look at the circuit.
Enquiries to K

W
.
. Ludlam from beginners
and unfit men (and women) expeoially
welcome. It waild be appreciated i f
non-sportsmen would use the Wednesday
training period so that overcrowding i s
avoided.
The main purpose of this artiols
was however to draw the attention of non-
sportsmen to the value of circuit train-
ing for reaching and maintaining a
> rea-
sonable standard of physical strength
and endurance. No s k i l l is. required
and the exercises are graded to suit a l l
types. Another advantage is that the
circuit can be completed i n less than
half-an-hour.
The I.C. circuit consists of nine
simple exercises which are laid out
round t i e room. The training rate,
i.e. the number of repetitions carried
out on each exercise, is taken as one
third of the maximum rate for each exer-
cise, whioh i s the number of repetitions
which oan be performed i n one minute.
When training one passes from one exercise
quickly to the next i n an anti-clockwise
direction until three laps of the circuit
have been completed.
SWIMMING
The swimming olub has an encoura-
ging turnout for i t s first meet of the
season on Friday night. The club w i l l
be meeting every Friday at Buckingham
Palace Road Baths from 7.30 until 9.30,
This i s an increase on last season of
one hours bath time, and w i l l allow
regular matches for a l l teams and In
addition there w i l l be time available

CONSimATION FOR OTHERS
SB
USE OF THE GYMNASIUM
A specific time-table has been
set out. If you wish to use the gym-
nasium (and I hope you do!) please try
not to clash with any other club's
activities.
After a training session or match
please remember to clear away a l l appara
tos, so as not to inconvenience others.
During weight training or circuit
training keep a l l weights on the mats
provided. Splinters in the floor oould
cause a person to suffer pain. On the
subject of splinters i t is essential not
to walk across the gymnasium floor i n
leather soled shoes.
Any information regarding looker
keys or tines when the gymnasium i s
vacant oan be found on the gymnasium
notioe board, (outside the door at the
east end).
HOCKEY 1
The olub i s going from strength
to strength and certainly the coming
season premises to be as successful
ss last.
The standard of play among the
Freshers i s extremely high, as was
shown when a Fresher XI beat Reading
University 4 - 3 i n the f i r s t match of
the season.
Additions to the Club Calendar
include a coaching oourse under the
supervision of David Archer, the Eng-
land Goalkeeper, also a 'Beer Evening'
intended to introduce freshers to the
third half.
Four teams w i l l be playing regu-
larly this season and with sufficient
support i t i s intended to field a 5th
XI - yet another milestone i n the
Club's history. Therefore, i f you
would like to find an up and caning
club and be assured ef a regular game,
ACT NOW! contact Mick Miller i n the
Garden Hall.
The most successful I.C. 'Sport'
team i s the Mixed Hookey (Marriage
Bureau) XI. Last year was a record
year, nevertheless i t is hoped to
improve on last years best performance
- 8 crates of Guineas.
I.C. GOLFING ASSOCIATION ;
Considerable interest was shown by
the freshers on the 'Freshers Day'
reception and a large number of names
were taken. There are several good
players among them and our team will be
considerably improved.
It i s hoped to start group lessons
far beginners i n a fortnight's time.
Three of our team w i l l be repre-
senting the university i n the Blasters
team - the 'A' golf side of the Univer-
sity.
