Dear Sir,
Let lis put cn sackcloth and ashes,
sit i n the gutter and cry. These
are the emotions whioh are forced upon
me as I walk around the centre of South
Kensington (now Imperial College?.
I am informed that the cost to
the oountry and tax-payer of our wonder-
f u l building scheme i s £20 million.
Despite this there i s not one piece of
architecture of any aesthetic value
whatsoever. I was sufficiently de-
pressed upon first seeing that concrete
fortress called"The Roderio H i l l Build-
ing", but hew my heart sank when this
term I observed the almost completed
structure of the Physios Block.
Oh] Beauty Beauty, tou are dead,
And only the beast doe live(?)

Dear S i r ,
Being suoh an innocent l i t t l e boy
I was absolutely shocked when at the
Freshers Reception a g i r l (or 'young
lady' should I say) approached my
particular olub s t a l l ! 'Can you do
anything for me?' she said.
That should I have said or dene?

A shy young gentleman.
Dear Sir,
I should like to offer some comment
on your latest Editorial (and the firet
I have heard.') by trying to put the case
of aome of the poor '10 t i l l 5' men.
Many studente live at home, because
of the high cost of lodgings nearer
College. In coneequence they apend
several hours a day travelling, time
which more fortunates can spend enjoying
College Club facilities, leaving I.C.
at 5 may just allow a meal by 7» and a
atart on "soaking up more Science" by
8 o'clock.
Briefly, the tired atudent fails to
understand lectures and gets even
tireder trying to sort them out at home.
Non-Scientific pursuits are neglected
under threat of the a l l important exams.
The only real cure for this type of
"day,student" i a , ae you say more
Hostel accomodation. Weeks Hall i s a
start but what i s an extra 60 rooms
among J,000. Unless and until this
can be provided I.C. i s better described
as a "Techanical College* rather than
part of a University.
Tours faithfully,
Non-Reaident.
Sir,
After your journal's 100 years
of conservatism I am diagusted that you
should suggest a vote against the Tory
party. I intend to cancel my
subscription.
Yours etc:
«D«T«R, SP*6T*T«R.

Freshers are by now probably aware
of the system of General Studies, which
are organised by the college. We are
told, by the more paternally minded
members of -the college staff,, that the
main idea behind theae talks i s to
enlighten our merry band of three
thousand or so illiterate scientists.
They do i n this caae of course,
defeat their own purpose, as only
those people already sufficiently
interested i n a certain subject will
trouble themselv s to go to a par-
ticular lecture. However they s t i l l
go on, and I hope long may do so.
This coming week, there will
be no General Studies. This i s due
to the fact that on Tueeday there
will be a Union Meeting, and the
following Thuraday falla on C
o

oration Day. The following week,
however, they will be resumed, as
usual.
On Tuesday, the 27th Oct., Pro-
fessor Blackett will continue hia talk
entitled, "Some Aspects of the His-
' -7 of Technology" which he started
last Thursday, whilst for those
interested i n the history of music,
Peter Stadlen will deliver a lecture
which he calls, "Mozarta Afterthought's"
Thuraday, 29th Oct. we see the
beginning of another series of lec-
tures, called, "The Poetry you never
did at School", given by the broad-
caster and poet, Patric Dickinson.
Hia f i r s t subject will be Louis Mac-
Neice, closely followed by talks on
John Donne, Robert Frost, Dylan
Thomas and Thomas Hardy. Mr. Dick-
inson has a somewhat unorthodox, yet
extremely informal method of lec-
turing, and hie visits are very much
appreciated by that small group i n
the college who are particularly
interested in poetry.
Also on Thursday, S.J. Could,
Reader i n Social Institutions at
L.S.E. will examine the Socialists
Look at Industry.
Other coming events are:
Oct.20th R.C.S. Mathematics and Physics
Society, presents their Freshers tea,
at 5.15 p.m. This i s followed by
the Presidential Address from Prof.
Blackett. Prof. Jonee will take the
chair.
Oct.28th Brewery Visit to Charri igtons.
