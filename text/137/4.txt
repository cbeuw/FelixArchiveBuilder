Slowly but surely that oollege
machine is grinding back into action,
the peace and quiet that postgraduate
students enjoy during the recession has
been broken by the patter of the tiny
and not so tiny feet of the Freshers.
The various sporting fraternities have
sifted their new supply of wheat and
having accepted the "grain" gratefully
have left the constituent college teams
to fight over the chaff.
By ancient custom Saturday
night is the night when men relax from
the ardours of their weeks work, and
seek aocial entertainment to provide
that relaxation. At college i t ia the
time when studente can get together to
diacuss the affaire of the moment.
When men can assuage the great thirst
cauaed by the afternoon'a manly
pursuits, and fortify themselves for
further perauita; when men, working
with men, during the week, seek the
company of women (well moat of ua any-
