FELIX CONFIDENTIAL
'Ex seweris'
An innocent young ICWArian walking
down Prince Consort Road last week was
shaken t o see a dishevelled, desperate
mob of males leaning out of the ground
floor window of the Aeronautios build-
ing shrieking 'Ye don't want promises,
(Jive us bread!' The presence of a
Labour oanvessing van in the road at
the moment was purely coincidental of
course!
Felix was surprised to hear that
one of the gay young sparks of the
ICWA oorridor last year has got herself
in rather a jam. Not only has she sunk
so low as to live with W
O
M
E
N but she
also has to be in by 10 o'clock at
night! '
Passers by in Prince Consort Road
late one night last week were amazed to
see a man scrambling down the scaffold-
ing outside the church. Their interest
grew when he was followed down by an
attractive young lady who was i n turn
followed by another man. Are they
taking Tommy Steele's advice and
'Going Ape'!
Scene:- Union Hall.
Enter from opposite sides a member of
council and a constituent College
President.
M of C:- Where the hell were you on
Freshers Day?
P of C C:- Well actually Old boy, I
was in the middle of the Atlantic cn
the „ueen Mary!
J of C (Unimpressed) First olass I
presume!
(Collapse of P of C C)
Judging from the noise emanating
from Room 23, Weeks Hall i 3 continuing
in the tradition of the other hostels
in becoming a 'Sport' den. Those
present i n the room were surprised to
see the respectable Mr. Carter grapp-
ling on the bed with an ICWArian.
The only comment uttered by the
owner of the room was a hysterical
"My wall! Mind my lovely wall".
Felix is interested to see the
Mr. ICWA i s taking good oare of his
lady charges. He was seen on Sat.
night i n a compromising state of un-
dress frogmarching a protesting Mr.
Nation to a certain ladies room
Vive l a Sport!
He understand that the landlord of the
5nnismore Arms threatened legal action
on the College unless aah trays were
provided i n the rooms..
One hears that a osrtain young
and exceedingly attractive Iowarian
has been preoipitcusly ejected from
her room (not i n the hostel) on account
of the enormous amount of noise
eadnating from a party she held. Latest
accounts vary but a reliable authority
has informed us that the.noise was due
to certain drunken miners taking
umbrage at the punch being adulterated
with ash trays arid the contents thereof.

FOOL AFOOT
IN LONDON
So this was London! not quite
perhaps, for a l l that oould be seen
from the airport bus were dark shapes
and innumerable advertisement lights -
common to most oities. To bed that
night with Ill-suppressed excitement to
see London i n i t s true colours next day.
m the morning after tucking into
a substantial breakfast, I sallied ee
forth to see London with several other
J.J.o's (Johnny Just come) under the
guidance, or rather the leadership of
a British Council representative.
At f i r s t there,was a tendency to lag
behind our guide owing to long stops
to gase at unfamiliar buildings and our
more leisurely pace. Eventually
however, we were caught up in the
feverish activity of London - the
frenzied hurry i n a l l directions.
The f i r s t real excitement came
when we entered an underground station.
The noise of trains was shattering and
the cold draughts from the subways
withering. In the train i t s e l f there
was l i t t l e consversaticn practically
everyone was either safely sheltered
behind a newspaper or staring meditativ-
ely into space. Even a oontigent of
Africans about fifteen strong evoked
only the merest l i f t i n g of an eyebrow
and occasionally, a cautious peep from
behind the penumbra of a newspaper.
The journey continued. Out of
the tube, into a bus then from the bus
a walk - across some most dangerous
pedestrian crossings. W
e saw a great
many buildings, but their names did not
stick 30 quickly were they passed. A
few landmarks were too obvious to be
forgotten. Few places apart frcm an
Olympic Games stadium could have so
many pigeons as Trafalgar Square and
who else but Nelson would be so high
up in the world?
After the first day a few of the
more courageous spirits amongst us set
off alone or i n small groups. The
experiences of these groups were
varied in detail but generally similar
in basic pattern. Many times we lost
ourselves and address books were hurried-
l y consulted, however due to the
bobbies the way was usually refound
(after some hard walking). .
Having (very wisely I thought)
provided myself with a tube map and
of course the i n f a l l i b l e ' A to Z,
I decided to strike out on my own to dis-
cover the lesser known quarters of London.
The f i r s t time I asked for a certain
street from a passer by he pointed down
one road saying "Fourth l e f t , second
right, third right and sixty yards on,
you can't miss i t " . Fair enough, but
after walking about two miles by my
reckoning and taking a score of turn-
ings without finding the street, I had
to give i t up.
I quiokly disoovered that next to
policeman, newspaper vendors were most
efficient for providing information
about their own localities. One 1
shall never forget. He was at a cross-
roads, i t was just after five o'clock.
When I asked him for a street, without
looking up or even apparently taking his
mind off his papers he said "Second Left".
I am in love with London, with i t s
great crowds and rush hours, i t s many
neon lights, i t s cosmopolitan nature,
the immense buildings, the variety of
motor vehicles in a l l stages of
disrepairs, but above a l l the pubs.
Finally I a a grateful to London
for giving me such a sunny welcome
and hope the winter w i l l be similarly
THE LOCK'S LAMENT
A scrummage i a a lovely sight.
When aeen from the outside,
With massive Forwards binding t i g h t .
Loud cursee as the hookers f i g h t ,
As I have said i t seems a l r i g h t ,
But only from outside.
I hurled myself into that pack,
A forward bites my ear.
My spine disintegrates Ker-crack
("For God's sake forwards get i t back")
They mean the b a l l and not my back,
I wish they'd make i t clear.
At line-outs next, my s k i l l t o show
I t ' s easy bo they say,
Stands next to me a brawny f o e ,
His s i z e twelve boot upon my t o e .
His elbo'v gives my teeth a blow,
This doean't seem f a i r play.
And now a t l a s t the end i s here,
I've got a twisted nose,
A broken back, a fractured ear.
Four teeth are miasing too, I f e a r ,
I'm lucky 1 can e t i l l drink beer,
That's something I suppose.

I GOT SUNK IN THE SINK
I had twelve bottles of whisky
i n m
y c e l l a r , and my wife told me to
empty the oontents o f each and every
b o t t l e down the sink o r else!
So I said-1'would, and proceeded
w i t h the unpleasant task, I withdrew
the cork from the f i r s t bottle and
poured the contents down the sink, with
the exception of one glass, whioh I
drank . I extracted the cork from
the second b o t t l e and did_likewise,
with the exoepte-On of one glass, which
£ drank. I withdrew aha cork from
the t h i r d bottle and emptied the ,
good o l d Booze down the sink, except
a glass, which I drank. I pulled the
cork from the fourth sink and poured the
bottle down the glass, which I drank.
I pulled the cork from the bottle o f
the next, and drank one sink of i t ,
and pured the rest down the glass.
I pulled the sink out o f the next glass
and pouredthe cork down the bottle.
I pulled the next cork out o f my throat
and pured the sink down the bottle, and
drank the glass. Then I corked the
sink with the glass, bottled the drink
and drank the pour.
When I had everything emptied, I
steadied the house with one hand, and
counted the bottles and corks and glasses
with the other, which were twenty nine.
To be sure, I counted them again when
they came by and I had seventy four.
As the house came by, I counted them
again, and I finally had a l l the bottles
and corks and glasses and houses counted
except one house and a bottle, whioh I
drank.

The Mathematician's Courtship
Let x denote Beauty; y, Manners well-
bred;
I , Fortune - (This last i s essential).
Let L stand for Love, our Philosopher
said,
Then L i s a function of x, y, and s,
Of the kind that i s known as potential.
Now integrate L with respect to dt,
(t standing far time and persuasion)
Then, within proper limits, ' t i s easy
to see,
The definite integral Marriage mast be.
(A very concise demonstration).
