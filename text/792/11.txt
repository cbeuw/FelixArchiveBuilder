Well 1 suppose it had to happen, the
Editor has gone quite mad this week
trying to get us to write witty pieces
for this Comic Relief issue. Judith has
even threatened to add a red nose to
my photo too, really all this wackiness
can get quite unfunny. Having read
some of the so-called 'funnies', I am
convinced that scientists are the most
unfunny people in the world. Imperial
defmately needs arts students.
I would also like to know what
people are going to have to do to be
oudandishly funny in the future. I am
reminded of the phrase T have
nothing against political jokes, it's
when they get elected I object'
especially with the Union elections on
the way. These organised one
upmanship competitions tend to bring
out the worst in people, with blatant
dislike of opponents often appearing
as sweeter than nutra-sweet niceness.
Why don't candidates realise that we
can all make our own decisions. I will
probably vote for the candidate who
makes a greater effort to actually
listen to students.
In this coldish weather I have been
forced to wear a scarf and I thought
nothing of putting on my CCU scarf.
However it was pointed out by my
sister the other day that I must care
a great deal for my college to go
through with wearing such a
dreadfully uncoordinated accessory.
I must admit to not caring a great deal
for CCU rivalry, so I suppose my
sister must be right. Then I thought
of the alternative Imperial C C U
scarves. Really there isn't a decent
scarf design going. Perhaps this is a
sad reflection on Imperial not having
an arts department. Might I suggest
that on seeing the tasteful St Mary's
scarf, that plain blue with white Fleur
de Lis would be more acceptable.
Naturally the fussy elements of the
student establishment will want their
gang's/CCU's emblem on the end.
However, I would certainly welcome
the new breed of scarf.
Finally, a joke to please Judith:
How many FELIX Editors does it
take to change a light bulb? ANS—
Three. One to put it on the list, one
to delegate the job and one to cross
it off the list when someone else has.
done it.
Record Rag
Totals Reached
Round-Up
So far this academic year Rag have
raised £15,000, £4,000 of which has
already been given to charities for
whom special collections were
undertaken. These charities are:
Action Aid, Mencap, Amnesty
International and the World Wildlife
Fund. The £11,000 and the money we
aim to raise this term, will be paid to
'our' charities next January.
Since the Rag incentive scheme
started in October, 14 people have
been awarded f-shirts by raising £100
and 4 sweatshirts for collecting over
£250. The 'mega-collectors' who
have earned sweatshirts are:.
Dave Williams (Physics 2) £428.56
Dave Tyler (Chem Eng 4) £359.93.
Fiona Nicholas (Biochem 2) £352.93
Nancy Reading (Life Sci 1) £259.98
To add an extra incentive for these,
and those who will pass the £250
mark in the near future, the scheme
has been extended. Anyone raising
£600 will be given a special '600
Club' sweater and £1000 will earn an
engraved pewter tankard.
Forthcoming Events
Friday 12th February
Milk Tray delivery service
I'm sure you've all seen the advert on
the telly where the 'hero' battles
against all evils to deliver a box of
Milk Tray to his love. On Friday
February 12, to celebrate St
Valentine's Day on the Sunday, Rag
are running their own delivery service
from the Guilds Office. A Rag 'super
hero', all clad in black will deliver a
box of Milk Tray to your Valentine
in the middle of one of his/her
lectures. Orders are being taken in the
Guilds Office and must be placed by
Thursday 4th, the cost is only £2.50
which also covers the cost of the
chocolates. Here's your chance to
show what a romantic you really are!
Saturday 20th February
Monopoly Rag
To coincide with BIBIC's London
flag day, Rag are running their
popular human version of the
Waddington's game of Monopoly.
Teams of four people, preferably in
fancy dress, will travel the board (the
streets of London) collecting money
and solving clues while trying not to
be 'nicked' by the roving 'Police
Van'. Monopoly is a great day out
and there's a free party for the players
in the Union Building in the evening.
IC Rag is being joined by Rags from
15 other colleges and so it should be
very successful.
Sunday 27th Mar, Saturday 2nd Apr
140 mile bed push
For the first week of the Easter
holidays, 17 people will be
endeavouring to push an old hospital
bed, given to us by St Mary's, from
Knowle Hall in Somerset back to
College. Knowle Hall is the
headquarters of BIBIC and on the
push we aim to raise £5,000 for
BD3IC, through personal sponsorship,
company sponsorship and by
collecting along the route. If you want
to go on the push or help organise it
contact me through the Rag
pigeonhole in the Union Office.
These are the major events for this
term but next term we've got the
annual Rag Fete on April 30th and
hopefully a River Boat Rave Up.
Here's to the next £10,000.

Rag Chairman.
