DEAR AUNTIE HECTOR
Terror
Dear Auntie Hector,
I have this terrible problem, I'm
desperate. Everywhere I go all these
sexy blondes chase me everywhere
wanting attention. I buy them houses
and give them all something to look
after but they still come running back
for more. I've tried singing as if I've
got three razor blades in my throat
and I make myself look hideously
ugly. I even got in with the navy boys
and went to sea singing silly songs.
All I want in life is to settle down with
a middle aged wife and the Scotland
football team. Do you think I'm being
unreasonable?
Stod Rewart.
Hector says: Your problem is a
very serious one, so at great
personal sacrifice I'm sending fifty
young mechanical engineers to your
aid which should alleviate the
immediate problems. As for the
middle aged wife, have you ever
thought about becoming a chat
show host?
Bestial
Dear Auntie Hector,
I've got this awful problem.
My got caught and the
, what the I thought. But how
' does help my when the
does not As you can see, I'm
at the end of my tether (no pun
intended), please help, fast.
Anon.
Hector says: In my infinite
wisdom I can see what is really
bothering you. Hector's advice:
Open the cornflakes packet first.
Anxious
Mums
Dear Auntie Hector,
I am a worried mother with a son
who wants to go to Imperial. He's 13
stone, tall, dark and handsome. He
plays American football and his
friends include Mick Jagger, Richard
Gere, George Michael and the Sultan
of Brunei. However, he is a very shy
and sensitive person. Do you think he
is the right sort of person to get the
most out of Imperial?
Mum Mk I
Hector says: I'm not sure
Imperial is for him. I recommend
the University of Siberia as a
suitable alternative.
Dear Auntie Hector,
I'm a worried mother with a
daughter who wants to go to Imperial.
She's 8 stone, stunningly beautiful
with measurements of 36-22-34. She
is a windsurfer and herfriendsinclude
Grace Jones, Jerry Hall, Kim
Basinger and, Princess Stephanie of
Monaco. However she is a very shy
and sensitive person. Do you think
she is the right sort of person to get,
the most out of Imperial?
Mum Mk II
Hector says: I think she will just
love Imperial! However, may I
suggest that she and a few of her
friends have a quiet chat with me
first, just to make sure.
Vicious
Dear Auntie Hector,
I've always wanted to go to China
and now that I've got the money I
planned to go this summer. But I'm
worried that they have an attitude
problem. I found out by opening a
packet of Chinese special noodles.
Inside was a little silver foil packet
on which was written 'Gae Yong
Mein Soup Base'. Being of a certain
persuasion this has caused me great
concern. Should I stay or should I go?
Anon.
Hector says: This, I'm afraid is
China's uneducated solution to the
AIDS problem.
i Hector's advice: Use a condom,
fly Virgin or try Blackpool instead.
Shame
Dear Auntie Hector,
I don't know which way to turn. I
was at this big party and everyone
thought I was a really good guy, we
were having a ball. Then this group
of fanatics gatecrashed and started
roughing things up. Me and a few
mates decided to leave and start our
own smaller party somewhere else.
Things were cool for a bit, I became
Mr Big again, but a number of my so-
called friends got bored and left to go
to another big party. My party is now
so small it's no fun anymore and I
don't know what to do with it. Where
did I go wrong? What should I do?
I feel so lonely.
Dave Owen.
Hector says: Dear Dave, I can see
a pattern forming, your party is
getting smaller, tending towards
zero. Perhaps you smell, or you're
just the anti-social type? However,
I do not think this is the case and
this is my learned advice: come out
of the closet and become a Tory. It
may be run by a chemist but they
are not all that bad.
Joker
Dear Auntie Hector,
I have this friend, well he's my
cousin really, who's got this problem
(5" is big isn't it?). His one eyed
trouser leg snake has a rather
embarassing tendency to swing to the
left when under pressure. He has tried
putting it in a splint but that didn't
work. He has also tried attaching led
weights to it but he had to go to the
hospital with a case of involuntary
circumcision. What advice can you
give him? Please help.
Anon.
Hector says: My advice to you,
sorry your cousin, on the first
question is not to worry, he is twice
as big as the average mountain
gorilla (honest, it's fact). As for
your second question: use your
other hand.
Mystic Hector's
Friday stars
Aquarius
If you are going to the Guilds Ball,
don't. I'm going.
Pisces
Something fishy is going on here,
beware!
Aries
Feeling a little sheepish! It's time to
relax. Look out for the fourth person
you see opening a packet of salt and
vinegar crisps. You could get lucky!
Taurus
Any friend of Morrissey is a friend
of mine. You are going to have a very
good day.
Gemini
Your sense of smell is going through
a particularly rough patch today. A
Belushi pizza will make all the
difference, especially when topped
with anchovy.
Cancer
Mercury, Venus, Saturn and Neptune
are in conjunction. Sounds good
doesn't it, but it makes f**k all
difference down here.
Leo
"ROAR, ROAR" said the Bald-Twit
lion. This is your sentence of the
week, use it wisely or be damned.
Virgo
My lord and master (crawl, crawl),
the greatest wonder of the Universe
(Judith Hackney, you fool!) is a Virgo
'too. She's had a rotten week, so
I things are bound to get better from
today. (They can't get much worse-
Ed). As Judith often mutters 'A Mars
Bar a day, keeps the Union away'.
Take note!
Libra
Thank Crunchie it's Friday; though
not in the biblical sense. Get it? I'm
wasting my time with you lot. Buy a
Crunchie anyway!
Scorpio
I feel sorry for Scorpios. Things just
1
never seem to go right, do they? I've
been informed from the Heavens (the
Editor again) that hypochondria is in
this year. Make the most of it.
Sagittarius
A man with a black dog will introduce
a wealth of possibilities if you play
your cards right.
Capricorn
Minkaleinen tama olut on? Ask
Mamo Kowisto.
