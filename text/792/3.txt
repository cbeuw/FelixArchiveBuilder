Cock fight: Valued at a lot more than two permanent members of staff. .
Hackney's
Brainstorm Bargain
In a shock announcement on
Wednesday FELIX Editor Judith
Hackney disclosed that vital FELIX
production equipment has been
exchanged for a painting.
The exchange was agreed between
Ms Hackney and the artist, who
wishes to remain anonymous, last
weekend. Both parties are said to be
'very happy' with the deal, which will
be put into practice on Good Friday
this year.
The painting is being kept in a
secret location in the heart of South
Kensington and has been mortgaged
to a value sufficient to pay for the
printing and typesetting of FELIX for
the rest of this year. The loan will be
paid off when the painting is sold and
the remainder spent on a holiday in
Barbados for the FELIX Editor, plus
a sun lamp for the FELIX Office.
When questioned about the
agreement Ms Hackney, aged 22, said
T didn't know what had hit me. It was
like a bolt from the blue.'
When she had recovered from the
shock, she explained that the decision
had been taken when the printing
press broke down for the fifteenth
time in ten days. T couldn't take it
any longer. My nerves were fraying.
I was at my wits end', she said. T had
to get rid of the damn thing somehow.
It was then that I was offered the
painting in exchange for the press,
typesetter and my two members of
permanent staff, it was too good to
refuse.'
The painting, entitled 'The Cock
Fight' has been valued at £3m by
Lewis' of London. Ms Hackney
believes that the exchange was an
excellent deal considering the
typesetter was valued at £20,000, the
press as useless and the two members
of staff, although invaluable to the
FELIX Office, at a few thousand
pounds each.
FELIX will continue to come out
every Friday during term time except
when Ms Hackney is on her extensive
world cruise between 1st April 1988
and 1st April 1989.
Theta gets the boot
The Royal College of Science Union
may decide to sell their mascot
'Theta' to City & Guilds Union.
Gorgeous, sexy Vice President Fiona
Nicholas, aged 83, wants to see the
sale in order to pay off RCSU's
massive debts. T much prefer our
new mascot George to that old lump
of metal anyway', she is reported to
have said one night when she was
very drunk and hoping that no one
would hear her. Ms Nicholas, aged
94, is believed to have offered Theta
to Guilds for £750. Guilds President
Dave Tyler, aged 3, was unable to
comment.
FELIX spills
the beans on
Holbein
There were red faces all round last
Sunday when the City & Guilds
Union Office in the Mechanical
Engineering Department was striped
bare by wacky raiders from Holbein
House's Beans Club. Official Beans
spokesperson Martyn Peck, mental
age 0.6, told FELIX earlier today that
'it was a doddle really. The security;
was lousy and we have several ex-1
Cons in our club.' The contents of the!
office were placed on Level Seven of;
the Mech Eng Dept while the security;
guard, aged 77, was invited to
tonight's Dinner & Dance by the
Club's official Stooge, Phil Arnold.
Guilds and College Security were said
to be 'not amused' by the prank and
called in the Police when the crime
was discovered. They have refused to
comment on why such a bunch of
drongos managed to fool their
security system so easily.
