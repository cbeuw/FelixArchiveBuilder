Robocop
This film has received so much hype
and coverage already that I can't
believe that anything I'll say will
influence people one way or the other,
so I'll keep it short, for a change.
Robocop has many ingredients—
The 2000AD comic series, The Six
Million Dollar Man, even The
Terminator. But whilst the
Terminator was a machine in human
guise, Robocop, rebuilt from the
brutally blasted remains of Patrolman
Murphy, is a human in robot guise.
When he's rebuilt, Murphy has all
of his memories erased by Security
Concepts, the company to whom he
belongs. He carries out his directives
to uphold the law and protect the
innocent to the letter. But slowly his
old self begins to emerge—first in
mannerisms, then in memories of his
wife, child and the people who
executed him. And so runs a gripping
yarn that involves high-tech
weaponry, a nightmare ghetto that is
Detroit, scheming company
executives and a twitchy three ton
malfunctioning law.-enforcement
robot called ED-209. A l l these
elements come together to make a
stylish and exciting film packed with
razor-sharp black humour. The
violence does tend to excess, but it is
in true comic book style, with bizarre
and grotesque deaths reserved for all
the bad guys. Given that he spends
most of the film under a mask, Peter
Weller is excellent as
Murphy/Robocop. Equally
convincing is Nancy Allen as his
partner, Lewis.
Robocop is a dead cert night out at
the movies. Don't miss it!

Eight years ago or so, condoms were
things called 'rubbers' that you
produced when your school mistress
was being excessively boring and
blew up behind her back, much to the
delight of your classmates. Their
howls of laughter would invariably
attract her attention and the old bat
would grin sadistically and make you
stand in the corner of the classroom
with the thing held between your
teeth. This was the first hint you ever
got that there was more to those little
things than met the eye. When you
finally found out what they were
really for (usually in the school
playground), reactions ranged from
stony stares of disbelief to 'gimme
one, I wanny try'. A few years later
you'd find out that all respectable
guys carried these magic bits of
coloured rubber in their wallets in
case of emergencies—so you'd rush
into your dad's study as soon as he
went to make a cup of coffee and
spend two minutes excitedly rifling
through his wallet trying to find the
little foil packet. Disappointed to find
that my dad obviously wasn't a
respectable guy, I spent two hours
with my head buried in the Oxford
English Dictionary, starting at 'rubber
(noun) coloquial...', progressing to
'intercourse', 'ejaculation', etc etc.
After this DIY education (and
managing to surreptitiously grab a
look at an issue of 'Playboy' or
'Penthouse', usually placed
tantalisingly beyond your average
school kid's reach) you grow up, and
things go (or come) in any number of
directions: either you carry the things
around, get hideously embarrassed
when they pop out when you're
fumbling for change for the bus, and
when you produce them the first time
you get off with a girl she promptly
starts laughing her head off. Another
alternative is that you end up with a
successful seduction on your hands,
or, like me, you read the SAS survival
manual and find out that condoms
should be included in every survival
kit as they make excellent emergency
water carriers, having large capacities
and being extremely tough.
Which is an interesting point: why
are condoms endowed with such
massive capacities? I could!
' understand if they were designed for!
King Kong, but poor old humble male >
Homo sapiens? Even the mostj
generous sex manual credits us with!
being able to produce just over a
teaspoonful. And colours? (The
condoms, I mean, not.. .never mind.)
Anyway; colours? You're supposed |
to wear them on your dick, (or your:
head, depending on the concentration
of alcohol in your body) for heaven's j
sake, not hold them up to the light to
admire. Mind you, I did once work
in a theatre where the lighting director
swore by condoms as a convenient
method of producing subtle lighting
effects (and producing the stink of
burning rubber).
Oh well, time to stop skirting
around the subject—on with the
review. I ran a few tests, all under
strict lab conditions, at standard room
temperature and pressure.
One: Jumping up and down on a
Mate as viciously as possible. It
survived—although I guess that I'll
know for sure in nine months time.
Two: Attaching a Mate to a water
tap and filling to detonation point.
The SAS manual is quite right—they
have a high capacity. But unless you
have the ejaculatory capacity of a ten
inch naval gun I think that Mates will
do thejob of holding the little bastards
quite adequately.
Three: Mates make satisfactory
everlasting chewing gum. Pop a
couple of Polos in one, pop it in, and
you 're away. The occasional top-up
Polo helps to keep theflavour going.
Four: Sex. You go through the most
embarrassingfive minutes ofyour life,
wishing you were Jonathan Ross and
had the guts tojust whip one out and
wave it around, and then youfind out
that she's on the pill anyway.
I don't know about their effects on
performance, but I can easily believe
that they're more effective and
comfortable than cellophane wrap,
old Mars Bar packets, barbed wire,
etc.
Okay, so far it's been pretty
lighthearted. However, here are a few
facts to be faced: the special climate
of the world is changing pretty darned
fast, thanks to AIDS and 'Fatal
Attraction'. And at the present time,
it looks like condoms are the only way
of safely indulging yourself, whatever
your sexual preferences. The first
time around you feel like a plonker.
'So what? To a girl nothing looks more
ridiculous than a guy in his
underpants and socks anyway, so how
could a condom make things any
worse?
You might find the Government
and Durex ads funny, and, in a way,
they are. But they also make a
genuine point—you're a hell of a lot
safer with those little bits of coloured
rubber.
Yawn, goes everybody, he's!
moralising. Okay, sod it.
One final tip: A survey in America!
showed that women liked red and;
green ones. i
