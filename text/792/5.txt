How
numbers
tell fibs
I have not yet heard an honest statistic
used in the political slanging match
over the state of the health service.
Oops, sorry, the previous sentence is
a serious sentence, but the rest of this
page is less serious, and I only
mention the Health Service because:
(a) there is a cartoon about it at the
bottom of this page; and (b) because
it provides some sort of topical
introduction to what I am going to talk
about, which is the misuse of
statistics, and how it can be fun.
Statistically, the previous sentence
is completely unreadable, as it
contains 67 words (well it did when
I wrote it), some of which are long
words. There is a formula called the
Flesch Readability Formula, which
judges readability by the length of
words and sentences and other such
things: according to it, most of what
I write is complete gobbledygOok.
However, I take comfort from the fact
that the same formula rates The
Legend of Sleepy Hollow as one-and-
a-half times more difficult than Plato's
Republic. I only mention it because
it neatly sums up the stupidity of
assigning single' numbers to
complicated entities.
Numbers can cause a sort of
paralysis in the part of the brain that
deals with common sense, this applies

especially to apparently precise
numbers. Imagine you are claiming
travel expenses and you lost your
receipts. You could claim for 'about'
£25, which might be all you can
remember. If you do, the claim is
likely to be queried, and you will be
asked to find the receipts: accountants
hate approximate figures. However,
if you claimed for £25.32, you would
probably get the money straight away:
the precision gives the illusion that
you calculated the figures exactly. I
do this all the time and it seems to
work. So do the people who advertise
cars: a figure of 52.3 miles-per-gallon
probably applies to only one car tested
under arbitrarily unrealistic
conditions.
Another example is the opinon poll
(perhaps the most abused statistic in
creation). They are accurate (given a
typical sample size of about 1,000) to
about plus or minus 2%. That is, if
a party has the support of 25.1% of
the poll sample, all that we can really
be confident about is that somewhere
between 23 and 27 % of the population
support them. During the last election
about 62% of newspaper headlines
were about trends in opinion polls.
More than 68% of them were based
on nothing more than statistical
fluctuations (actually I made those
two exact percentages up, just to test
your credulity, but they are about
right). Never believe a newspaper
headline based on a statistic (unless
of course it proclaims Statistical
Fluctuation Gives Labour The Lead).
But numbers have nothing on
pictures when it comes to effect. If
you want to exaggerate a case, use a
graph. If you have a slight trend that
you want to exaggerate, you can chop
off the appropriate axis and stretch it
out to fill a page. This can make any
small advance (in company profits or
whatever) look like the north face of
the Eiger. This is a common
technique in advertising, where
graphs are like being hit by a bus: it
isn't the numbers that count, it's the
impact.
However, if you really want to have
fun with statistics, you have to
extrapolate. Take the world
population growth up to the early
sixties. Do a sophisticated statistical
analysis to fit it to a mathematical
model. The result you get is a
prediction of infinite world population
some time early in the 22nd century.
This is, of course, nonsense. But it
is no worse than the sort of figures
used by the Department of Transport
to predict traffic levels on the M25,
except that they underestimated the
trend. In fact, the world population
model, though clearly ridiculous, has
fitted the actual figures for the last
twenty years better than any
alternative. Some people would get
worried about this.
Mark Twain once wrote something
appropriate:
'In the space of one hundred and
seventy-six years the lower
Mississippi has shortened itself about
two hundred and forty-two miles.
That is an average of a trifle over one
mile and a third per year. Therefore,
any calm person, who is not blind or
idiotic, can see that in the Old Oolitic
Silurian period, just a million years
ago next November, the Lower
Mississippi was upward of one
million three hundred thousand miles
long, and stuck out over the Gulf of,
Mexico like a fishing rod. And by the j
same token any person can see that I
seven hundred and forty-two years!
from now the Lower Mississippi will i
be only a mile and three-quarters J
long, and Cairo and New Orleans will
have joined their streets together, and
will be plodding comfortably along
under a single mayor and a mutual
board of aldermen. There is
something fascinating about science.
One gets such wholesale returns of
conjecture out of such a trifling
investment of fact.'
How to Lie with Statistics is written
by Darrell Hugg and published by
Penguin. Join the trend: more people
use it every year.

Statistics show that I will never get
my thesis written up if someone else
doesn't start writing for this column.
I want your contributions. They can
be short, long, news, features, abuse,
single words (if they are long
enough), in fact absolutely anything
that has the slightest connection with
science.
