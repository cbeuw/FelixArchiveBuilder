No one, including the Oxford English
Dictionary, seems sure whether the
concept of 'relief from relief exists.
However, after twenty-four hours of
solid, unmitigated comic relief ICSF,
in conjunction with the Medical
Research Council and the OED are
undertaking research into just such a
field: Comic Relief Reliefoscopy.
This glorious piece of world-
shattering original research will be
taking place at Imperial College, yea,
even in our very own Union Building.
Furthermore we require members of
the general twinkling public to help
us with our research, and this means
you! Yes, you can be part of this
journey into the unknown for a very
paltry (tax-deductable) donation to
research funds. Members of ICSF,
you may attend for only £2.50, but
even the rest of you need only donate
£3 for a whole day working alongside
our research teams, and your very
own slightly handcrafted badge as a
souvenir.
The leaders of the research teams
will be personally addressing the
audience on their own specialist fields
during the day. Professor Terry
Pratchett, author of the classic texts
on the subject, The Colour of Magic,
The Light Fantastic and Equal Rites
(the last dealing with most of the
mathematics) and his more recently
published work Mort, will be
addressing the audience at about 2pm
and Dr Mike Scott Rohan, author of
two published works into extremes of
temperature, Run to the Stars and The
Anvil of Ice may do likewise at about
5.30pm. In addition, background
material will be on display throughout
the day. The full programme is as
follows:

who really knows most about their
subject.
