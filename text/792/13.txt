Spend, spend
Being stranded in a desert and being
forced to spend £20, together with
copious amounts of food and
champagne ensured the resouding
success of the recent Esso Business
Game.
Following the desert survival
exercise, designed to develop skills
in group participation, Esso
introduced a brainstorming exercise.
Each of the three groups received £20
which had to be spent in a novel way
while being mutually beneficial to the
group. An hour later, after much
discussion, one group had formulated
a plan—to have a picnic on a number
73 bus on the way to Foyles, Charing
Cross Road and to buy a novel to
donate to the Haldane Library.
The plan was implemented one
lunchtime a few days later—after a
delicious picnic, a copy of Yes Prime
Minister—Volume 2 was purchased
and presented to the Haldane Library.
Thanks are due to Esso for their
generosity, and to the group members
who resisted the temptation to find the
nearest pub!

Auction
Prince Phillip, Chris Tarrent, Kenny
Everett, Douglas Hurd, Neil
Kinnock, Mary Whitehouse. These
are just some of the celebrities who
have categorically refused to attend
the IC Radio Charity Auction in aid
of Comic Relief tonight.
Nevertheless, you, yes you, will
have the chance to buy literally tens
of items at bargain prices. And some
of them are even things you might
want!
You can listen in between 7pm and
lam on 999KHz or 301m medium
wave, or hear us in Southside Bar, the
Union Bar and Linstead Bar. You'll
be able to give bids to any IC Radio
hack who looks suitably bemused, or
phone them on 3440 (89 from a
staircase phone in Linstead/
Southside).

Debating
dodos
For all of you who think that tnc
Debating Society is full of pretentious
articulate students who only debate
the serious moral and philosophical
problems of our day. Well unless the
motions 'This house prefers
cornflakes to rice crispies' and
'February should be abolished' strike
you as being major political debating
points, then you are probably wrong,
but perhaps we should debate that
particular point...
Really we are fun-loving people
who prefer to debate wacky points so
if you want to experience the latest
sensation since the Big Bang then
come along to the Physics U G
Common Room, Level 2 on Friday
lunchtimes at 1pm.
