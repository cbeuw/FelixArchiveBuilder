MUSIC
by Phil Young
Hi there! Comic Relief is here so
now's the time to enter into the spirit
and do really silly things and give lots
of money to a good cause. Where are
all the red noses? Go on, buy one—it
might come in useful!
Musically, things are very quiet at
present, so I'm making the most of
the 'Fabulous February Savers' and
going to Aberdeen, leaving behind but
three gigs of mention.
Tonight, the Boogie Brothers
continue to bounce around the
London scene, playing the Red Lion,
Brentford. The metal-cum-gothic
sounds of The Rose of Avalance can
be heard at the Clarendon,
Hammersmith. This leading hard-
core indie venue has been threatened
with the axe, so sign the petition
outside Kensington market now!
Tomorrow there's a wild nostalgic
punk night at the Klub Foot,
Hammersmith, where 999 and
Chelsea play to a stomping,
slamdancing riot. Or there's always
the O Jays and Levert on Friday and
Saturday at Hammersmith Odeon, or
The Alarm at Kilburn National
Ballroom on Wednesday.

FOOTBALL
by Adrian Grainger
The teams of London return once
again to the league trail, some
smarting from cup defeats and keen
on keeping up their challenge in the
only competition left. All games are
on Saturday February 6th with 3pm
kick offs.
QPR vs Charlton
Loftus Road (White City tube)
A match between two teams who have
played West Ham in the Cup this
year. QPR are fresh from their Cup
win last week and seem to have
regained some of the form that took
them to the top of the league earlier
this year. They have a dirty player of
the name of Gavin Maguire to watch
out for and a new Israeli international
defender in David Pizanti. Charlton
still sit at the foot of the table and I
can't really see them getting anything
out of this game. Let us hope that this
week the QPR home game finishes at
4.45pm and not an hour later! Last
week was a farce, with the ticket
forgers the only ones coming out on
top. QPR to win quite easily.
Wimbledon vs Newcastle
(Wimbledon Park tube)
Plough Lane plays host to a game
between the in-form Dons and the
unpredictable Magpies. Fashanu—or
Fash the Flash to his friends—is in
form with 17 goals so far this season
and a £1 million rating looks quite a
bargain. Will he join brother Justin
in becoming the first brothers to have
a £1 million tag? Newcastle hit Lou
Macari's Swindon for five last week
with Paul Gascoigne netting two. At
comic relief time it is a relief to know
that there is still a comic left in
football. (Did you see Saint and
Greavsie last week?) This game could
go either way so I'll do a David Owen
and sit on the fence and not tell you
which way my money is going.
Crystal Palace vs Birmingham
Selhurst Park (Norwood Jtn BR)
This should be quite a good game.
Palace are having a good season and
only a silly result last week at Oldham
prevented them from being second in
the second (confused?). Bright and
Wright are still doing the business,
it's 41 so far between them.
Birmingham are in the last 16 of the
Cup and striker Steve Wigley could
gum up the works along with
midfielder Ian Handysides, a handy
man to have on anyone's side. Palace
should return to winning ways and
justify their high position.
Millwall vs Bradford City
The Den (New Cross tube)
My old favourites Millwall play stage
to what could be the game of the day
in London against fellow promotion
hopefuls Bradford. That man
Cascarino with 16 goals to his name
could hold the key. Bradford smashed
Maxwell United, I mean Oxford, in
the Cup last week and are a dangerous
side. A striker named Hendrie netted
one of the goals. What a versatile
chap he is, playing snooker in his
spare time and then helping the
northerners to reach the last 16.
Millwall look to have the edge in this
game with a 2-1 victory seeming the
sort of result to expect.
Fulham vs Mansfield
Craven Cottage (Putney Bdg tube)
Once again Fulham are entertaining
a side in the lower reaches of Division
3. Old 18 goal Leroy Rosenoir is still
18 goal Rosenoir and a 5-1 defeat last
week for Fulham doesn't exactly
inject any enthusiasm into a deflated
side. Mansfield gave Wimbledon a
good game last week and a 2-1 defeat
was respectable. Mansfield have a
striker called Stringfellow on their
books and he could club it to Fulham
if given the chance. Fulham to win.
Leyton Orient vs Hartlepool
Brisbane Road (Leyton tube)
The Eastenders face the North-
Eastenders in this Division 4 clash.
Orient led Forest last week and at
times it was hard to tell which was
the 1st Division team. It would have
been nice if Orient had made it further
in the Cup, but now they must
concentrate on promotion. Hartlepool
have players on their books called
Nobbs and Tinkler, so what more
needs to be said. Orient should wrap
up the game by half-time and let us
hope that the scoreboard is working.
Football is a funny old game and I got
2 out of 7 predictions right two weeks
ago and none right last week. The
standard predictor does about as well,
so I should toss a three sided coin if
I were you.
Game of the day:
\Millwall vs Bradford
