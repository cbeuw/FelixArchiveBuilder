FELIX
T h e c r e d i t s
Thank you to all the staff who have had to put with me this week!
This newspaper was edited by Judith Hackney aided and abetted by Rose
Atkins, Dean Vaughan, Chris Martin, Pippa Salmon, Kamala Sen, Hector
Sullivan, Charles Robin, Andrew Waller, Chris Jones, Daniel Shiu, David
Jones, Adrian Bourne, William Lumb, Steve Black, Nigel Baker, Tom Yates,
Martyn Peck, Bill Goodwin, Phil Young, Adrian Grainger, John Noble, Lloyd,
Chas, Simon, Chris, Rupert, Alan, Jon, Alastair, Cosmic and all the collators.
Did we catch you out? This small 16
pager contains some of the best
humour at Imperial this week. God
help us! Last week I told you that only
vaguely funny articles would be
printed in this special Comic Relief
issue. Perhaps these words fell on
blind eyes. There wasn't a solitary
amusing letter or article from any of
you. I could make the excuse that 16
pages was the maximum number of
non-serious pages I could possibly get
away with but the truth of the matter
is that our printing press once again
played the ultimate trick on me and
broke down on Monday and amusing
copy was very thin on the ground. I
expect to see every one of you
wearing a red nose, whether it be an
official one or a home-made FELIX
one to make up for it. I hope that you
will drop at least lOp into our rag can
today. If I have got my act together,
there should be one with every
departmental messenger.
Valentine's Issue
Don't be shy. Send a small ad to the
one you love. All valentines messages
will be put in free of charge and if
you're the first couple to get engaged
through FELIX, we will give you a
magnum of champagne to celebrate.
Finally...
Please don't take this bilge seriously,
