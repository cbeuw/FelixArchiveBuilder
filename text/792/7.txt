Union
Here we are again, back after almost
two weeks absence with more news
on the absolutely wondrous
entertainment on offer this term.
Today, Friday Feb 5, we are staging
a 50s night with the Union bar in the
Lounge. The centre of attraction will
be two 45 minute sets by the Big
Town Playboys the most authentic 50s
swing band around. Those of you
who follow the gig guides will no
doubt have heard of or seen them and
I am sure you will agree they are not
to be missed. On top of this we are
doing some crazy things behind the
bar, the first commers will get beer
and lager at 50s prices, ie lOp and
15p, while stocks last and from then
on the bar will be just plain cheap.
There should be videos and there will
be a disco so why not come on down,
the price is certainly right at a mere
£1.50 on the door or £1 in advance
from Norman's and Ents cards 50p.
Oh by the way, doors open at 8.30pm
and the band's on at 9.30pm.
Letter from
St Mary's
Each year in the Rec. Centre bar,
Wilson House, the most intriguing
event commands the attention of the
Medical School. It offers the
participants the chance to be daring,
to pit their wits against the law
enforcement agencies of the land in
the noble cause of being the champion
scavengers for the year.
The night starts at 5pm with the
official booking in and the allocation
of points for particular hauls is
released. Only those items listed as
worthy of inclusion will earn the
respective teams valuable points in the
league.
Traditionally, the celebreties do
score highly but due to an increasing
non-compliance by the famous the
supply of stars has dried up. Noticable
achievements on the past include
Melvyn Bragg and A l Jerone. While
not exactly in the same league two
Chelsea Pensioners and a bus load of
Japanese tourists have been co-opted.
Obviously the Japanese wished to
experience a typical English night of
fun and frolics.
The lengths people go to to remove
certain objects is amazing. The hiring
of vans, the use of the public transport
to a co-ordinated degree is stirring to
see. One of last year's objects was a
plastic Chef, approximately 1x
h times
life size. This was left after the event
and spent an interesting few weeks
doing the rounds of Wilson House late
at night, to scare the occupants as they
entered their rooms. It worked, too
(I can personally vouch)!
The ubiquitous Harley Street sign
and plaque from the Praed Street
'Special' Clinic usually make annual
appearances. Surfboards, temporary
bus stops and an entire set of garden
furniture have been recorded in the
past.
All items must be off the Medical
School property at 11pm and should
be returned to their original sites.
Police co operation is good, as every
year getting a 'copper' or a van
upstairs earns good points.

3. It is not essential to pre-book
practice rooms, but it is strongly
advised that you do so, particularly
if you wish to practice at lunch times
or in the early evening.
4. Any practice room which has not
been claimed within ten minutes of
the advertised time will be available
to others on a first-come-first-served
basis.
5. To get the keys show your music
pass to the messenger on duty at the
main desk on the ground floor of the
Sherfield Building. You will be asked
to sign for the keys and to surrender
your pass whilst practising.
6. Do not monopolise the room for
more than an hour without returning
to the messenger's desk to check
whether someone else is waiting to
use it.
7. Return the keys immediately
after you have finished and see that
their return is countersigned by the
messenger or security guard on duty.
Do not simply pass the keys on to the
next user of the room—you will be
held responsible until they are signed
back against your name.
8. Please report any problems (such
as piano faults) to Prof E H Brown.
Ensembles and music groups
needing to book more than a week
ahead may do so through the
Conference Office in accordance with
normal booking arrangements. Such
advanced bookings will automatically
be blocked out on the weekly booking
sheets, thus preventing others from
double-booking the room in question.
Arrangements for the use of the
grand pianos by authorised users are
still being determined.
