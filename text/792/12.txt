The fifth event in the new year was
an 'O-Cross' at Wisley, just off the
A3. An O-Cross can be considered as
a one person relay. The mehJ
completed a 10km course consisting
of 3 different loops of approximately
3km. The women completed a similar
kind of course of 5.5km. This kind
of event is unique to any others in that
there is a mass start providing a much
more competitive air. The weather
stayed fine but it was bitterly cold.
Preparations are already underway
for the British Student Championships
in North Yorkshire and the J K
International event both held during
Easter.

IC Mixed—2
School of Pharmacy Mixed—5
Following my last report in FELIX,
I've been commissioned to write this
week's offering. The game was
played in Burnswick Square on a
kiddies playgournd, but that's another
story. Suffice to say that the first half
was competitive and attacking, on a
very small pitch. Each team had many
scoring chances and IC were at their
lethal best; the result 0-0 at half-time.
The second half started with two
goals inside a minute, Mark Lewis
and Debbie Tucker were responsible
and Schaun Westfinnishedboth goals
off, unfortunately both goals were
scored by SOP. After this the flood
gates opened and goals went in at both
ends, but IC never quite recovered
from their explosive start.
Person of the match for IC was
John Spencer who had a magnificent
game playing right half for SOP who
only had 10 players at the beginning
of the game.
Snooker
Friday morning and the first of the
fencers arrives feeling very dizzy
(claims he's got an ear infection!).
Adam arrives just on time saying that
he's had a good night's sleep and no
hangover (highly unlikely). We set off
on time on the three hour drive to
Bath with the usual competition
nerves.
Today's the epee individual with
three competitors from Imperial—two
very experienced for the men and one
complete beginner for the ladies.
Favourites are Richard Gore,
international fencing at home, or
Peter and Adam (if one didn't have
an ear infection and the other had a
hangover) and UCL who have a very
strong team all round.
Arriving in Bath with ten minutes
to spare, and with some skillful
navigation from the lads, we managed
to get lost, despite the fact that the
university is signposted all the way!
Panic over, we changed for a late
start. The competition is arranged as
pools of six with three promoting.
Fights are first to five. The men's
epee kicked off an hour late and our
two got through the first round with
no hassle.
Meanwhile the ladies' epee, well
supported as ever, starts with only
two pools of five! I start my pool in
the Ladies' epee without a much
needed warm-up lesson. This is only
my third experience of epee ever. The
first round of the ladies epee finishes
and so ends my second epee
competition. But at least I'm not last
and I've got my first epee victory
under my belt.
I now busy myslef cheering the
others on through the quarter finals
and into the semis. This is where our
luck starts to change. Adam is very
unlucky with hisfirsttwo fights losing
9-8 and 10-9. (This high score is due
to the fact that double hits can be
scored in epee.) He fails to regain his
earlier form and sadly goes out. By
this time it's getting late and if we
leave now we could reach home by
midnight. Unfortunately, Peter is
doing much better despite his 'ear
infection', and gets into the final
having only lost his balance once.
Fatigue is really starting to set in now
(Peter's quite tired too).
An hour or so later having drowned
Adam's sorrows, Peter comes third
overall in the epee and is selected to
represent the U A U the following
weekend. At last we can head off back
to London. Eventually having
delivered everyone to their homes, I
hit the sack at 1.30am and set the
alarm for 5.15am, ready for an early
start back to Bath for the foil.
Results—Mens Epee:
1st Richard Gore (Bath)
2nd Adrian Griffiths (UCL)
3rd Peter Cripwell (IC)

VK Acton Impulse—3
Imperial College 1
15-8, 15-11, 12-15, 15-10
What can you say? One match after
defeating the league leaders, Imperial
met the third team in the table, Acton
Impulse, a strong collection of casual
players, many of whom have played
for IC in the past. Many excuses can,
and will, be made for this
performance. Acton fielded a guest
star from the London Youth Team in
the enormous but athletic form of
Donald 'Honey Monster' Deans, and
his presence seemed to inspire the rest
of the squad. Imperial were sorely
missing captain Filippos Frangulis
and his crocodile, Palookaville, and
as for the referee....well, if looks
could kill (Imperial are a disciplined
team, y'know) then he would be dead
meat. If this sounds like sour grapes,
then that is precisely what it is.
The truth of the matter is that Acton
simply were the better team on the
day. Imperial looked as tired as the
cliches in this article after the fixture
three days before against Varsovia,
and never really found their feet. The
back court play was not up to the
mark, and opportunities were lost by
bad serving. Altogether a slack
performance, and hopefully one that
will not be repeated.
Racing
London Sabres—6
Imperial College—8
With a crucial UAU outdoor game the
following day, Tuesday night saw a
potentially weakened IC indoor side
matched against league and cup
champions London Sabres. After a
feeling out period, Sabres were the
first to score. An instant reply,
provided by Mark Vamadevan, was
vital for the IC side's confidence.
Sabres then retook the lead, were
levelled and then scored again
through a penalty. Were it not for the
defensive play of brave goalie Simon
Chittenden and full backs Andy Lewis
and Mark Rayfield, the game would
have been lost by the internal.
However, Vamadevan put the teams
on a second half par with a brilliant
dribbled goal beating both timing
buzzer and goalkeeper. Chittenden
saving numerous short corners and
two penalties, IC were trailing 6-4
with only ten minutes to play. At this
point the IC turbo charger (in the
form of diminutive Andy Lewis) cut
in. Inspired from the back
Vamadevan, Mark Lewis and Fitter
all scored again (totals 4, 2 and 2
goals respectively) to force an
excellent 8-6 win.
Baseball
Last Sunday, despite extremely strong
gales gusting to force six at times, the
intrepid IC Sailing Club team went to
thrash the living daylights out of the
City University team. So keen were
IC, that they arrived an hour before
City did. Having watched the white
capped waves washing over the club
house steps, the teams set forth into
the storm.
The wind bit hard into the sails as
the first race was started with a bang.
As the sturdy little vessels steamed
towards the first buoy, the boats
keeled over with the crews' noses
inches from the foaming water. With
defeat only inches away from the City
team only drastic measures could save
them and they rammed our star boat.
Both capsized and all that could be
seen behind the upturned IC boat was
Ape's cap floating into the distance.
Due to the courage and fortitude of
Jenny Burton, the crew, he was pulled
from amongst the wreckage to live to
win the race.
Having returned to land to refit the
boats, the racing continued. Paul
Robbins was hero of the next race by
carefully plotting the course his helm
should sail, to lead them to victory.
In the final race, with the score 3-3
City in the final desperate bid to win,
threw IC crew member Sam Page into
the waves, leaving her to swim to the
rescue boat and still IC managed to
win. Grateful thanks to Sam Page,
Jenny Burton and Paul Robbins
without whom victory would have
been impossible.
