Linstead Hall in Princes Gardens
was last week the scene of attack on
a female student. This sort of
personal assault on female students
is all too common in Universities up
and down the country. Last year
saw a report by Oxford University
Students Union which revealed that
up to four out of ten female students
had experienced some form of 'date
rape'.
No one can justify this level of
attack, but are we doing enough to
try and stop it? When investigating
the news story, Felix reporters
encountered resistance. The excuses
were varied, 'Yes, report the story,
Abortion debate
Dear Jonty.
I was very pleased to read that
anonymous letter in last Fridays
issue, concerning the, as the writer
calls it. 'Pro-Life Society'. I very
much agree with what is written in
the letter, but I feel that one or two
crucial points are missing. The
debate is mainly about whether a
woman has any right as to her body
or not. The aim of the Pro-Life
but don't mention the Hall where it
happened', 'for the girl's sake don't
cover this story'.
I have deliberately avoided
identifying anyone in the story,
being painfully aware of the plight
of the individual concerned. But the
issue must be raised. It must be
made clear that people are at risk,
whatever the cost to admissions to
Imperial College. In attacks of this
sort it has to be made clear those
who are responsble will be punished
and that there is no penalty if those
assaulted speak out.
If every time an incident occurs
the victim is told to keep quiet then
nothing is achieved. If anything, it
makes matters worse, the victim
suffers from the belief that they are
Society is to enforce their petty

'Everybody has the right to

Dear Senior College Manage-
ment, thank you for your interest in
last week's Beit Back; if you have
a complaint please address it
directly to me instead of to your
cronies in the Union Office.
Due to a pressing Degree
Ceremony I will not be around for
the final closing moments of this
Felix. It thus falls to me to thank
all those who have persevered in
producing the newspaper that you
hold in your hands. Most of all, I
would like to thank those who found
me a ticket and a gown for the
degree ceremony but do not
necessarily want to be mentioned.

Dear Jonty.
I just want to give you my opinion
on the 'Pro-Life' movement, since
one of your readers strongly
resented your description of it. I
think this society deserves its name:
not only does it try to avoid
murdering unborn children, but it
also helps pregnant women in
difficulty who can't keep their
babies for various reasons. In this
case, they can avoid illnesses
resulting from their own efforts to
abort. Now. you may think that the
word 'murder' is a bit too strong:
Well, just have a look at the latest
investigations scientists made on
human brain cells: their new idea
is to take some of them from unborn
babies to cure elderly people
suffering from Parkinson's disease.
Now. I am not going to discuss
whether it's morally correct or not,
Dear Jonty.
1 was interested to hear of your
correspondent's complaint about the
I C U Pro-Life Society's name
("Name withheld by request', Issue
944). This name was fully approved
by I C U in our constitution, and
reflects the first of our constitutional
objectives—'Affirming, defending
and promoting the existence and
value of human life from the
moment of conception, and to
defend and protect human life
generally and in particular, whether
born or unborn.' How we can be
construed as being anything other
than Pro-Life is beyond my ken.
but just trying to point out that if
scientists have chosen cells of an
embryo, and not those of any
animal, this might suggest that this
embryo may be of the same species
as a fully grown-up person. So,
when abortion is committed, it is
scientifically speaking killing a
member of our* species, isn't it?
Now, let's turn to these
'complications and illnesses' during
pregnancy: if the mother is likely
to die because of these, and the baby
can be rescued, who would you
rather save? 1 know it's a difficult
question to answer, but it is worth
thinking of.
As for 'KKK gatherings outside
Irish women MPs' homes', I think
such meetings don't deserve such a
home, since K K K was strongly
racist—which Pro-Life is not!
Those gatherings are just small
The Pro-Life movement uses
plain language to communicate the
truth of abortion to the public. The
pro-abortion movement sadly feels
it necessary to manipulate language
to obscure the facts. An example is
the creation of phrases such as 'pre-
embryo' and 'products of
conception' to deny the humanity of
the unborn child.
I didn't see the Channel 4 News
programme to which 'Name'
refers, but is (s)he aware that
Ireland's constitution accords equal
rights to the unborn child and to the
mother? Thus abortion is legal
reminders for politically influential
persons that pregnancy isn't a
'disease you're prevented from
using condoms and pills, just like
any other sexually-transmitted
disease', as E . Keeling put it in last
week's issue.
But I must agree that 'verbal
abuse' of Irish pregnant women
flying to England is to blame,
especially if these women believe
their only way of getting rid of the
difficulties they encounter in their
pregnancies. There should be more
advertisements on societies helping
these women to keep their babies,
and not just posters like those on the
underground walls saying: 'Not
every pregnancy is wanted—
Abortion Centre—confidential
help', whatsoever.
What about raped women? I think
that rape is already such a shock to
under life-threatening
circumstances.
There is no reason why British
Pro-Lifers should not contribute to
the Irish abortion debate, just as we
all show concern for human rights
in Bosnia or Tibet, for example. I'm
sure British pro-abortionists will be
contributing, as they have done
most vociferously in the past. I have
heard no reports of picketing of
Dublin airport, although radical
Irish anti-abortionists did protest
outside a woman MPs home.
However, the Irish Pro-Life
umbrella group unequivocally
women's feminity one shouldn't
add one to their maternity, for
abortion is not trauma-free, even if
it is made by pills such as RU486
(see Hospital Doctor, 2-11-89).
Furthermore, those poor women
should think, if possible, that killing
their baby won't kill their trauma,
just like removing a cancerous
tumor, because he is not responsible
for what happened: the man's to
blame, the baby is an innocent who
just wants to be loved the way he
is, just like anyone else in the
world.
Now, I'm pretty sure this article
won't convince you at all, but I just
wanted to give you some clues to
think about, just saying that every
human being has a right to claim
'Life is worth living, even though
not so from day to day!'.
E.V.
condemned such tactics, as do we.
Education, free debate and
persuasion are our tactics.
(Thankfully, intimidation and 'no
platforming' of Pro-Life delegates
and leafleters at NUS Conferences
are no longer so commonplace—
anti-abortionists are perhaps
seeking a more democratic image.)
I hope I've answered your
correspondent's points. Until next
time my 'warped and stunted
imagination' is required.
Yours unoffended,
Mike Castles. Chair.
