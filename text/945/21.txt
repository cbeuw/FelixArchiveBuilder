Trouble in Mind
Twelfth Night
You certainly know who
Shakespeare is. You might not
know 'Twelfth Night'. Well, you
will have the opportunity to see it.
Not only is DramSoc staging this
play as its Christmas production,
but it is also shown by Past
Imperfect Theatre Company
directed by Philip Osment, in the
Drill Halls Arts Centre, next to
RADA.
Presented is an up-to-date
interpretation with fitness exercises,
modern bright coloured clothes and
nowadays facial expressions and
gestures—all of it to true, difficult
to understand Shakespearean
language. The characters are quite
excessively played, just as it is
expected of a hearty comedy.
Especially I enjoyed the part of
Malvolio who wore an upper-face
mask. Since she was restricted in
facial expression, acting and voice
had to perform all the stronger.
Several of those theatre graduates
are black, which adds a further
variety.
Near the end, there was a small
accident which disconcerted the
whole company for a short moment:
Sebastian kissed an actor instead of
an actress...But it was a vivid
production in the end surprising,
too.

Liar, Liar
All of a sudden the title becomes
clear to me: As two squabbling
sisters may yell this in childhood,
the play is a visit to the scene of two
sisters meeting in adulthood. Their
dialogue uncovers their
resentments, regrets and harsh
memories. These are squeezed out
through bouts of anger and
frustration.
The sisters, Anna and Gill, are
very different people and their parts
are played, by M . G . Macdonald
and Kate Worth respectively, with
varying degrees of competence.
It's a patchy play; dragging at
times and too choc-a-block with
angst and pain at others, and, on the
whole, the brevity and lack of
fluency doesn't serve such a theme.

Written by Alice Childress, one of
the leading black writers in
America, Trouble in Mind is set in
a Broadway theatre of New York,
at the time of the Montgomery Civil
Rights marches (1956)
Willetta Mayer (Carmen
Munroe), a black vaudeville star
who has spent much of her career
in the role of the 'southern black
mammy', turns up for the first
rehearsal of a new play. There she
meets the rest of the cast—a group
of black and white actors. The
play's director is Al Manners
(Maurice Roeves), an early-forties,
hatless, well-tweeded product of
Hollywood. As the rehearsals
progress, prejudice and
compromise is revealed as the
actors come face to face not only
with each other but with the racial
politics of the play that they are
about to perform. The harrowing
account of a lynching prompts a
compliant Willetta to question not
only the attitude of her white
director (considerate and
understanding after his own
fashion; selfish and tactless
according to hers), but also those of
her fellow actors.
Munroe's powerful performance
and Roeves' vitality match perfectly
the challenges of the plot; the script
attempts to amalgamate two plays
in one forcing the actors to switch
between roles. Moreover, what
makes Trouble in Mind a wonderful
play is not only that it is a comedy
about backstage life. It is also that
it presents a human problem with
all its immediacy and relevance in
a very witty manner.

I don't like yer attitude, pal..
Exile
Exile by David Ian Neville presents
us with three different perspectives
of a single terrorist act in Northern
Ireland. The play is made up of
three monologues. However each
character talks to an invisible person
(a dead wife or absent husband etc)
and this broadens the scope of the
play impressing on us that there are
many more than these three who are
affected.
Jane Reilly (Gail) and Finlay
McLean (Peter) play the wife and
father, respectively, of a soldier
disabled by the blast. Though the
choice of characters is not unusual,
the twist here is that the soldier lives
with Peter. Both actors powerfully
use their parts to draw the audience
('Trouble in Mind')
in, making the pain at once
universal and individual.
Sandra is the girlfriend of the
terrorist responsible for the bomb.
Corinne Harris plays a character on
the point of psychosis betrayed, by
her trust in a futile conflict. She is
the unseen casualty and this
increases her suffering unbearably.
The play avoids politics keeping
the drama on a personal level with
the only cry being one for peace.
The inevitable by-product of this is
that the arbitary nature of terrorism
is seen very clearly; 'Toy soldiers,
that's all we are'. Certainly a play
to see and muse over.

Three Shouts from a Hill
This is a series of one act farces
written by Sean O'Casey staged by
the O'Casey Theatre Company
from Northern Ireland.
The first 'End of the Beginning'
sees a husband and wife exchange
jobs to prove a point. The inevitable
chaos that followed was supposed
to be amusing and unfortunately it
was not. The humour in this play,
written in 1934, is somewhat dated.
In 'A Pound on Demand' a
workman 'on the up' slurs and
staggers his way aided by his friend
to the counter in a post office to
demand a pound. Whilst attempting
to write his signature the disruption
caused forms the basis of the farce.
This was definitely a welcome
change from the limp antics in the
first farce.
The last play 'Bedtime Story'
centres around the guilt of a young
pious catholic bachelor who regrets
the events after having invited a
young girl to his lodgings. The
series of farces started off badly but
picked up and ended on a high note.
'Three Shouts from a Hill' was at
the Lilian Baylis Theatre, Sadlers
Wells. Frankly the time and money
invested in some other pursuit
would have been more worthwhile.

Which Witch
The Piccadilly Theatre is currently
home to a surprising opera musical
Which Witch. Set in the
unenlightened Europe of the
Spanish Inquisition. It is the
powerful story of a woman's
forbidden love for a young,
tormented bishop. Talented voices
and a varied musical palette
combine with excellent sets, to
produce forbidding, Dante-like
imagery, interspersed with light,
humorous moments. Reactons to
the sometimes nightmarish scenes
were variable; this performance
allows no indifference. If you can
afford the steep ticket prices, this
is a unique, artistic performance to
be enjoyed.
