No Ozone, No Go Zone
Chantelle Ward from the Environmental and Appropriate Technology
Society outlines the latest developments and the Government's plans on
the ozone layer depletion.
'People have got more important
things to worry about these days!'
retorted my friend Penny, when I
told her that I was researching an
article on the ozone layer.
'What's new anyway? Aerosols
are now C F C free, and the
Government has legislated to ban
them totally. What more can a
person do but wait for the
legislation to come into force?'
'Well,' I said, 'Quite a lot
actually.'
With the recession biting so
deeply, environmental issues have
been in the news much less than in
previous years. Nevertheless, ozone
depletion trundles on regardless;
new discoveries abound, provoking
fresh rounds of negotiation between
governments, pressure groups and
industry.
The 1990 Montreal Protocol,
which set dates for phasing out the
use of ozone depleting chemicals,
is now thought to be too optimistic.
Governments hoped that industry
would voluntarily stop using these
chemicals before the deadline, but
in most cases this has not happened.
So governments are now to meet in
Copenhagen, in the hope that they
will be able to renegotiate earlier
phase-out dates this November.
Most now appreciate the sheer
magnitude of the problem.
Indeed, Fiona Weir of Friends of
the Earth describes ozone depletion
as a '...threat to human life...'
which '...marks a critical point in
our Earth's history.'
Even so, why this sudden
resurgence of interest in the political
arena? Perhaps because there is
now a sinister twist in the tale. Not
only is the ozone layer being
depleted as fast as 1-2% per day,
N A S A have predicted the
development of a late winter 'ozone
hole' over the northern hemisphere.
Obviously, this will involve Britain
directly. When the ozone hole was
discovered over Antarctica, I am
sure that a lot of people in this
country thought: 'That is the other
side of the world. How can it really
affect us?' whilst in the meantime,
the death rate from skin cancers in
Australians and New Zealanders
was on the increase.
A 1 % decrease in the thickness
of the ozone layer is thought to
increase the incidence of deadly
skin cancers by 3%. A sobering
thought, and closer to home than
you may think. The emotional strain
any type of cancer puts upon
families involved cannot be
overemphasised. Even if you are
declared free of the cancer, there
are still regular check-ups for the
rest of your life. How would you
feel if a friend or relative died like
this? In every hundred people, three
more people may become
vulnerable by the end of today.
A 1 % decrease may also lead to
an extra 100,000 cases of blindness
due to eye cataracts. Operations to
treat them can be difficult,
particularly in developing countries.
Harmful ultra violet rays may
suppress the immune system,
leading to lower resistance to
diseases such as tuberculosis.
Epidemics can occur in countries
which still have the diseases at low
levels.
All of these ailments will put a
huge burden on health care workers
if scientists' predictions turn out to
be correct.
Tests by an Australian research
team have proved a link between
stunted plant growth and higher
levels of ultra violet radiation
caused by ozone depletion. Peas,
beans, soya and cabbage develop
smaller leaves, are more vulnerable
to pests and disease, and have a
lower nutritional content. This has
serious implications for feeding the
world's population, which is
expected to double by the year
2000.
I know that at this point some
people will be shaking their heads
in despair. They may care deeply
about the whole issue 'but no one
can turn the clock back'. However,
some scientists believe that we can
if conditions allow and the very
least we can do is limit the damage
we are doing.
The British government has
shown willing by signing the
Montreal protocol, but needs to take
a tougher line with industry.
Friends of the Earth research shows
that only one in four electronics
companies using ozone destroying
chemicals are planning to use safe
alternatives to CFCs ahead of legal
deadlines. Also, according to
Friends of the Earth, ICI, the
chemical giants have been
marketing Halon 1211 (a more
powerful ozone detroyer than the
main CFCs) to developing nations.
Governments and industry will
shy away from the issues, but
remember that both are made up of
people who have to make these
decisions. Could you be one of
them in the future? Some of us will
end up working for the three
electronics companies which did not
plan to use safer C F C alternatives
ahead of the deadlines. A handful
of us may end up in Parliament.
Even if your work is not so high
profile, you can still write to your
MP and stay informed. So look to
the future and fight to protect the
ozone layer.
Skin cancers often start if you are
badly sunburned as a child. Will
that be your child? As every day
passes it may become 3% more
likely.
