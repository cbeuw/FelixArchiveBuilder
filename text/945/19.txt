Inside the Firm
I try in vain to convince myself
that I read no more than thirty pages
of this book. Fat chance. Every
page, every trough of sludge, acts
as an impediment to the
understanding of the criminal mind.
This vapid tome no more explains
the motive for the Kray crimes than
it does how or why the publishers
were conned into buying the rights.
The only remotely interesting
passage is when the author suggests
that the Kray jail sentences were
handed down somewhere higher
than the Old Bailey. This is of more
relevance to the Bently case,
recently reviewed by the Home
Secretary, and frankly is more
pertinent to that case than to the
Kray case. The book only serves to
graphically illustrate the brutality of
the Kray murders, and to show a
complete lack of remorse or even
reflection on the part of the guilty.
So much for the rehabilitative
effects of British justice.

Machiavelli in Hell by Embracing Earth Madonna Unauthorised
That Niccolo Machiavelli has had
a profound influence on human
society will not, I think, be argued.
Machiavelli correlates to diabolical.
The Devil correlates to
machiavellian. Intelligence and evil
have always had this synonymity.
What Sebastian de Grazia has done
here, is not merely to depict a fresh
appraisal of Niccolo, but of hell
itself, as a corner of paradise.
Niccolo, the much-maligned
statesman, philosopher and, for
centuries, the antichrist himself, is
portrayed in the light of his
irreverent anticlericalism. His own
document to Lorenzo de Medici,
The Prince, intimated that the state
must have its enemies (for 'state',.
read 'clergy', for 'enemies', read
'Machiavelli') and his play
'Mandragola' made light work of
clerical hypocrisy. This astute
evaluation is as antipolemic as its
subject, and as worthy of respect;
it is superbly argued, beautifully
written, poignant and funny.
Moreover, the world will confer on
this book contemporary classic
status now, fortunately, the Vox
Populi is the Vox Dei. Heaven
forbid it should become the church.

The first thing that struck me was
how pretty the pictures were, and
when I got it home they were just
as beautiful and fascinating. This
photograph album of a book is a
collection of snaps of the planet
Earth taken from a space shuttle,
false colour pictures from satellites,
and photos taken with ordinary
cameras from earth. My personal
favourite is the picture of wind
speeds over the Pacific.
This is a coffee table book, with
each picture accompanied by a short
explanation. Interspersed were
quotations from the Oxford
dictionary of trite sayings and
cultural appreciation in the form of
crap poetry, which only detracted
from the book.The authors tell you
tales of damage to the environment
as a sideline. What they really want
though, is cash from all the people
who bought 'A Brief History of
Time' and then left it unopened on
their coffee table.

Celtic Design-

There are three books in this series,
'A Beginners Manual', 'Knotwork'
and 'Animal Patterns' and being a
beginner I felt the former was the
best place for me to start.
As soon as I opened the book I
was impressed; not printed in
ordinary text the whole book is a
beautifully written manuscript. To
make the most of this book you
need proper nibbed pens but even
if you sit down and proceed with
only pencil and paper you will be
surprised at how quickly you can
progress. Everything is explained
clearly and concisely in simple to
follow steps. A Beginners Manual
leads you from step patterns
through key patterns and spirals
onto Celtic scripts, page layout and
letter decorating. If you are unable
to produce a stunning page of
manuscript by the time you have
finished working through this book
then I can only assume you are
illiterate or blind.
The other two books in the series
concentrate on more specific sectors
of Celtic design. Knotwork leads
you through setting up grids and
constructing simple knots onto
extending, in one or two
dimensions, these simple knots and
more complicated spiral knots, plait
work and borders. This book is
again beautifully written and
supplemented with 434 illustrations.
Although not as simple to start with
as 'A Beginners Manual' if you can
only afford one of these books you
will find this easy enough to follow
'Madonna Unauthorized' vaguely
describes Madonna's life from her
humble upbringing to the 'Queen of
Blond Ambition' that she is today.
The book details how she changed
from homeless down-and-out in
New York to the world's highest
paid female artist, in a matter of
years.
Everything is included in this
book; her marriage to Sean Penn;
her numerous affairs with men and
money; the time she spent on the
streets of New York and her own
opinions on anything from
Catholicism to Kevin Costner.
There are also quite a few facts that
I was surprised to read, including
her excellent school report and her
three alleged abortions that took
place before and during her
marriage.
The 400+ page book is written
in the style of a bland gossip column
but the subject matter is so juicy that
this is rarely noticeable. At only
£4.99, this book is a must for all
Madonna fans.

without having read the former
beforehand.
'Animal Patterns' is the most
advanced of the set of books, laid
out in the same style as the previous
two, but needing a slightly larger
base of previous knowledge this
book will enrich your Celtic
'vocabulary' to incorporate the
birds and the beasts of ancient
times. Having worked through the
other books 'Animal Patterns' will
show you how to expand your style,
including snakes, griffins, dogs,
people and birds. Highlight your
new knotwork skills with animals
and wrap animals up in knotwork.
By the time you have made it
through this series which also
includes Illuminated Letters you
will be capable of producing
amazing manuscript pages,
astounding border patterns and
impressive carpet-page patterns.
Maybe you want to decorate your
leather jacket or design your own
tattoo; maybe you are just nurturing
a longing for an insight to the sadly
neglected art that is Celtic Design.
If you want to make the most out
of this series and are serious about
Celtic Artwork you will need a
proper set of nibs. If however you
are just interested in or appreciative
of Celtic art you will still enjoy
these highly creative and well
thought-out books on the subject.
Whilst catering for the complete
beginner they are not too simple as
to be laid aside by the already
experienced Celtic designer.
