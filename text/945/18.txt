Holy Joy, Bill Pritchard,
Disney Girls—Powerhaus
7.10.92
Oooooh. Look at that. What a wide
and varied collection of stars we
heave on stage. If we had Patrick
Moore, we'd have a viable
alternative to 'The Sky At Night'.
What's Moore, they're only second
support. Steven and May (Vocals,
See See Rider), Ben Blakeman
(guitar, Cocteau Twins), Benny
Dimassa (drums, AR Kane, Frazier
Chorus), and Tracey Lamb (bass,
Girlschool) have a C V
comprehensive enough to act as a
Who's Who of pop, so what do they
sound like? A cross between The
Beautiful South - May's vocals
could easily belong to Brianna
Corrigan - and the phoney pop
power chords of Shakespear's
Sister. For only their second gig,
it's all looking good.
Bill Pritchard is Billy Bragg.
Holy Joy are all of the current
scene's most influential bands,
Carter, James, Levellers, all rolled
up together in a tumble drier, and
somehow I get the feeling I've
heard it all before. But so what. I'm
old. I've heard everything before.
I'm getting too old for this game.
Oh, deary me, is that the time? I've
got to go and pick up my
pension...At one point, the lead
singer says 'You know the words,
sing', and no-one does. Oh dear.
Holy Joy are not very captivating.
Boing, time for bed.

The Devlins—Live Bait,
Dead Bait ep
I picked up this ep and thought, 'oh
no, not another run-of-the-mill Irish
rock band!', but I took it home
anyway and gave it a listen and
swiftly changed my mind. This is
a dreamy, trippy, sort of an ep,
especially 'Drift' and 'Dead City
Radio'. It's the kind of music you
can listen to and forget all about
these hassles you've been having,
if only for a while. Any excuse to
forget about that last problem sheet
I say, you can work if you want.
Listen and like it, you've been
told!

Adorable—Homeboy single
Adorable were one of the big indie
hopes of this year, part of the
unholy trinity of bands that included
both Suede and Verve. Suede who
have the burden of expectation
resting heavily on their shoulders
have so far made the right moves.
Verve, whose wanky art-house
glam postuming has detracted from
the quality of their music which has
been a credible extension of the
Manchester scene. Adorable like
Verve have not been without their
critics. Criticisms of their sound as
derivative are not unfounded.
Though their sound is perhaps more
relevant that 60s and 70s revivalism
of both Verve and Suede. Their
The Jesus Lizard—Liar
The Jesus Lizard do not come from
Seattle. They do not sound like
Nirvana. Virtually all their records
(including this one) have been
produced by big black frontman
Steve Albini. They are on the
Touch and Go record label. This
should be recommendation enough
for you all to rush out and buy their
records, but this is a review, not an
ad, so...
Lead singer David Yow must be
a seriously fucked-up person if his
lyrics are anything to go by. It's
quite apt that this album's called
Martin Stephenson & The
Daintees—Kilburn National
And then there was the time he
busked a night in Derby and made
£1.70.
It's all you're worth we cried
'Aye, your not wrong'
acknowledged he, before stealing
into the audience, then stealing our
beer, then stealing our women but
we don't care because he's Martin
Stephenson and Martin is our best
mate.
And that's how it is. None of
your posing, pouting, petulant,
popsters here. Martin's in the big
armchair and we're the gog-eyed
children hanging onto every word.
Martin directs the whole shebang,
one song drifts at a tangent and
becomes another, his bemused band
scrabble to keep up.
'It's guesswork up here' chunters
Anthony bass man Dunn but his
broad grin tells of an old story.
When you have five crazed
Geordies (whose only split in
allegiance is whether Newcastle or
Sunderland FC) with more smile
quota than is natural it's hard not
to become infected: We were. The
Road crew were. Even the 8ft
searing guitar attack often disguises
the quality of their songwriting and
their understanding of pop
dynamics-which in my opinion has
seen them more effortlessly through
this year with the pristine pop of
'Sunshine Smile', the gothic rock of
'I'll be your Saint' to their third
offering, the seminal sounding
Homeboy. With an infectious
chorus and a sonic barrage of
guitars which gatecrash the track
half-way through. This is a good,
if not a great, record and a sign of
better things to come.

• Out Monday on Creation.
Adorable play the New Cross
Venue tomorrow night.
'Liar' because the first line in the
record is 'I'm calm now, I've
calmed down'—and calm is what
Yow most certainly isn't.
The only other band I know that
produce music with this kind of
warped, claustrophobic implicitely
violent feel to it is New York's
Unsane, so records like this aren't
ten-a-penny. So, instead of being
mad, silly and part of it this
Saturday, rush down to the Rough
Trade shop and buy this record.

he gets many easier nights in
Kilburn).
C U T . For then there is but an
accordian, a guitar and the wistful
'Think Only of the Child' and we,
transfixed, hear the pin drop.
After 214 hours, my throat hurts,
my hands hurt, my feet hurt and
I've just heard the most beautiful
The Farm-
Me
-Don't You Want
No, I don't. Go away, you accursed
blasphemers at the shrine of
Poptasia. You have defiled our
sacred icon and you are sentenced
to burn in hell for the rest of
eternity.

The 4 of Us—Man Alive LP
I told you last week that this album
would be good, and guess what...I
was right! Naturally.
The album consists of catchy rock
songs with a 'dance' beat to support
them (—the dance beat actually
works well and doesn't ruin the
songs). They sing fucked up love
songs for our fucked up generation,
and do it with flair and a style of
their own. No U2 wannabes here,
just a band being itself and
succeeding nicely.
'She Hits Me' is all about getting
screwed up on alcohol—'Car Crash
At 80mph' is about getting screwed
up on drugs, and the rest are just
as straight. But don't worry—if you
don't listen too deeply to the music
it's more likely to lift you up that
depress you.
Just play it and enjoy...

Daintees are gone. We would be
