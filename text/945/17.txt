Babes in Toyland —
Edinburgh Queens Hall
How exactly I came to be in
Scotland was surprising, quite how
I came to be in the same country as
support band Jacob's Mouse was
annoying but how the hell I came
to be watching Babes in Toyland in
an Edinburgh church was
downright bloody bizarre! Then
again, they do things differently in
Scotland, you know.
The Queen's Hall in Edinburgh
is a church, no converted about it.
As a result it's civilised beyond
belief. No alcohol is to be
consumed inside it (there is a
separate bar though) and smoking
is allowed only upstairs to protect
the carpets. What's more you don't
need to worry about leaving the bar
early because in true theatre fashion
there's a bell rung to tell you when
the band's about to take the stage.
They start off a little shakily, I
think that like me they're a little
awestruck by being in what is so
obviously still a house of God.
That's not to say that the Babes
don't eventually impress....they do,
no problem but trying to thrill a
crowd that's sitting or standing on
rows of pews takes some doing. In
the end though everybody is at least
shuffling behind their altars, some
stagedive a little too close to the
stained glass windows for comfort,
but we're all enjoying ourselves.
Having said that Babes in
Toyland aren't everything Melody
Maker would have you believe,
screaming a lot won't convince me
that you want to be taken seriously.
Aggression doesn't necessarily
mean talent. Luckily though, it isn't
all screaming, the songs in the set
sung by the drummer are not only
a change but also an improvement.
In the words of Frank Bruno the
Babes are a different kettle of
kippers altogether on vinyl and
maybe by trying to impress the
punters with the musical talent they
undoubtedly have, instead of trying
to scare the shit out of them they'll
be just as good live.

Papa's Magic Beard-
Edinburgh Venue
If you thought London was leading
the 70s revival, woah!, you're way
off the mark. In Edinburgh the
revival's been happening so long
that the summer of love has long
passed and the autumn of
grooviness is goin' on. Papa's
Magic Beard are Pan's People with
facial hair and attitude, musically
they're the Jimi Hendrix
Experience jammin' with Bob
Marley and the Stone Roses. Either
way they're irresistable.
The sad truth though is that the
band will almost certainly never
make a record let alone sell one
because their music isn't destined
for the masses. If there was such a
thing as the U K birthday party
circuit PMB would be household
names from Lanarkshire to London.
To make it big anywhere else the
Beards would have to start taking
themselves a bit too seriously...but
as long as they're enjoying their
music as much as they seem to be
tonight there's not much chance of
that.

Verve, Gravity Grave
Whereas the class of 91 had nothing
to say for themselves, and had a
tendancy to stare at their shoes. The
class of 92 have tried too hard to
redress the balance, and have been
made to look pretty stupid by the
music press. Verve and Adorable
have been the main culprits.
Verve's third single 'Gravity
Grave' is a sign that they are
fighting back. Their first record,
'All in the Mind' was slightly
flawed, and suffered as Richard
Ashcroft said because of the band's
inexperience in the recording
studio. The second single, 'She's a
Superstar' showed a willingness to
experiment with their sound.
'Gravity Grave' sees the fruition of
those experiments. The rhythm
consists of a pulsating groove with
a shuffling drum beat. Guitars
jangle in and out of the mix, setting
a perfect soundscape for Ashcroft's
laidback vocal. Contender for single
of the year.

• Out now on Hut records.
REM —Automatic for
the People
Whilst 'Automatic for the People'
embodies the spirit of 'Out of
Time', it is a much darker record
than its predecessor. The principal
themes are ones of death,
desperation, loneliness and
alienation. The first single and first
song on the album, 'Drive', is a
stunning ballad. It deals with the
alienation of the young from
popular American society, a
consequence of the policies of the
Reagan and Bush eras. It also cites
the inability of Rock to have an
effective voice in the face of such
adversity. 'Smack. Crash. Bush-
whacked... hey, kids rock and roll,
no one tells us where to go". This
theme is further explored on
Tgnoreland', when Stipe launches
into a vitriolic attack on Bush. This
is one of the more upbeat moments
on the album as is the wonderful,
'The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonight',
the prospective second single.
Though the upbeat moments are
few and far between. The songs
tend to melancholy without
dragging the listener under to the
point of no return. This is a
Toad the Wet Sprocket —
Fear
Another band from across the Pond,
but will you remeber them for their
name, or for their music? Who
cares. I hear you say, well, at least
let me bloody finish!
They were supposed to sound like
REM. in fact they do, so much so
that the intra to 'All I Want' sounds
almost identical to 'Losing My
Religion' (oh dear). Yes, they also
have a mandolin which makes the
REM connection, but the violin is
more noticeable giving it a
somewhat Pele feel; in other words
they are a poppy, folky, country,
dreamy band but you tend to notice
the former two more than the latter.
The stronger material on the
album like 'Pray Your Gods' and
'Stories I Tell You' begin with
interesting open string guitar
collection of songs that most of all
offers hope. This is typified by the
song, 'Everybody Hurts'. Here
Michael Stipe sings 'everybody
hurts, everybody cries, when you
think you've had enough of this life
hang on'. Stipe also offers hope on
'Sweetness Follows'; 'It's these
little things that drag you under, live
your life full of joy and thunder,
closer now a little bit'. Swathes of
feedback envelope the song as does
the sound of a dischordant cello and
a grinding organ in the background.
The theme of distortion is carried
over in the song, 'Star me Kitten',
originally called 'Fuck me Kitten',
a refrain audible in the chorus. This
is a song about obsessive love, and
the distortion this can give to the
relationship. It seems that whilst
'Out of Time' was out of synch with
the times, 'Automatic for the
People' is a record for the 90s in
so much as it helps you to deal with
the traumas that can win your life.
It's a celebration of the darker
recesses of the human mind. It's a
great record, and REM's greatest
work so far.

arpeggios creating a hung, tense,
mysterious atmosphere which
gradually becomes more aggressive
towards the end. They are instantly
likeable tracks, but alas (my dear
lass) are instantly forgettable.
My last mention will be for T
Will Not Take These Things For
Granted' complete with
aesthetically beautiful
arrangements, cathartic vocals and
ethereal atmosphere (i.e. PASS
T H E SICK BAG).
The album overall is very
consistent, but lacks originality
though there is a lot of innovation.
It may appear to the commerically
orientated, but for my tastes I'd
rather spend the money on fish 'n'
chips and several pints of Guinness.
