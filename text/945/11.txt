Mercy drive to Russia
As Ilya Eigenbrot risks border guards, hyperinflation and the Russian mafia
toprovide aid to those starving inStPetersburg, D e c l a n C u r r y asks why?
Some may think that Ilya Eigenbrot
is slightly mad. At the end of this
month, he is to make a return
journey to his native Russia, driving
overland through some of the most
dangerous territory on earth. He
will deal with corrupt border
guards, harsh weather conditions,
and a mafia that makes the Italian
variety look like stage props on
'Blazing Saddles'. His mission is to
deliver medical and scientific
supplies to the people of St.
Petersburg.
This is Ilya's second trip to the
Russian republic, which he left as
a child in 1973. A chemistry
postgraduate at Imperial, Ilya last
went to Russia in July, bringing
medical and scientific supplies. He
was shocked by what he saw. T had
seen the third world on television
but I did not expect to see the fifth
world in Russia,' he says.
On his first trip, he and his father
drove across the Finnish-Russian
border to St. Petersburg, and then
drove a second car to Moscow. Ilya
explains that their first car, with
foreign registration plates, was
becoming an obvious target for the
Russian mafia. They decided to
change to one with less conspicuous
Russian plates.
On this journey, Ilya and his two
colleagues, Colin Lawrence and
Ben Krystall, will travel by ferry
from Harwich to Gothenburg, and
then drive to Stockholm. After this
they will take the ferry to Turku in
Finland, and then drive for an
overnight border crossing.
Of the total journey time of ten
days, the trio will spend three and
a half days in St. Petersburg, their
only port of call. On a total budget
of £900, they will bring further
medical and scientific supplies to
the beleaguered city. The medical
supplies will go to one regional
hospital in the area. Ilya believes
that it is better to concentrate help
in one building, rather than
spreading it around different
hospitals. Scientific supplies will be
delivered to the St. Petersburg
Marine Technology Institute and the
St. Petersburg Machine Builders
Institute. Russian science, once a
driving technological force, is
dying. The British equipment, some
second-hand from Imperial, is a
vital, if limited, lifeline.
Ilya decided to make a second trip
after witnessing shocking scenes of
deprivation, decay and
disintegration. He was strongly
advised not to return to Russia. The
The Mechanical Engineering Building in St Petersburg
Street sales, hawkers sell dried fish and old toys for hard currency
border roads the team will be
travelling along are isolated and
patrolled by the Russian mafia, the
vicious, ruthless remnants of old
Communist brutality. The mafia are
not above the law in Russia. They
make the law. Acting with complete
impunity, undeterred by a
hopelessly ineffective police force,
the mafia stops and seizes foreign
registered cars, stealing contents
and abducting passengers. The
normal manner of stopping is with
a machine gun. Ilya and his team
will wear bullet proof vests.
Ilya does not paint a hopeful
picture of life in Russia. After
telephoning colleagues in St.
Petersburg, he says that things are
now even worse than in July. He
points to the problems of exchange
rates and hyperinflation, both
mauling the standard of living, and
reducing the republic to a state of
chronic shortage. Monthly inflation
is currently running at between 10%
and 15%, yet wages for public
sector employees have not been
paid for three months. A professor
of Marine Technology at St.
Petersburg Marine Technology
Institute earns only £7 per month,
when he gets paid. Currently, the
professor, his wife and his mother
are surviving on his mother's
pension and his wife's paltry
income.
The future does not hold much
cheer. A hard winter is expected.
It has already begun to snow in St.
Petersburg, one month earlier than
usual. The temperature in Moscow
is currently 10°C below freezing.
Ilya also expects mass famine this
winter. Storms have knocked the
wheat crop down, and the potato
harvest has failed. There is still no
sign of Western aid reaching those
who need it. The Mafia sell
humanitarian supplies on the black
market.
Russia remains politically
unsettled. Coupled to the worrying
rise in anti- Semitism, Ilya is
concerned at the widespread feeling
in St. Petersburg that a coup is
imminent. Not, he adds, 'the
operetta of last year', but a well
planned, ruthlessly executed coup,
either from the military or from the
far right. Many in Russia feel that
only a coup could end the current
'Alice in Wonderland' economics.
He adds that some Russians would
prefer to be a nourished slave rather
than 'a starving free man'.
All this reinforces Ilya's
determination to deliver aid directly
to the people. In spite of what he
has seen, he remains slightly
optimistic, and dismisses critics
who say his mercy mission is a drop
in the ocean. He says, T can do
something as a student and that
encourages me as it shows that
we're not as helpless as we first
think.'
