Student Concern ICU Careers Fair

/CNN Political Reporters
The Liberal Democrats are
demanding action on student
poverty, saying that 'it is time the
problem is taken seriously'. Don
Foster, the Liberal Democrat
Education spokesman, has swept
aside Government claims that the
Conservatives are the party of
education, and accused the
government not being committed to
students. Mr Foster says that replies
to a party survey show that 93 % of
full time students are 'desperate' for
term time employment to pay
regular bills. He adds that the
number of students seeking help
from student union welfare advisors
has 'increased significantly' over
the past two years. 'Students have
been dealt a triple whammy of
delayed payments of grants at
insufficient levels followed by
chronic undergraduate
unemployment', says Mr Foster.
High Street banks have also been
expressing concern at levels of
student debt. Barclays Bank claims
that the average student leaving
college this year will owe £1,765,
and they expect this to top £2,800
in three year's time. The Midland
Bank say that 7% of student
accounts have overdrafts of between
£500 and £1,000, and Lloyds have
announced that the proportion of
students with overdrafts has risen
from 39% to 44% in two years.

The Imperial College Union
Careers Fair took place on Tuesday
and Wednesday of this week. 54
companies attended the Fair,
slightly down on last year's figure.
The number of students attending
the fair was also down this year.
This drop is being blamed on the
recession, though the organisers are
quietly pleased at the turnout.
The fair comes at a time when the
level of graduate unemployment is
rising, and when companies are
rethinking their recruitment
policies. The number of employable
graduates has increased more than
the number of vacancies. A
representative of British Telecom at
the Careers Fair said he expected
in excess of 8000 applicants for
only 150 places. Students applying
for employment last summer have
said that this is not atypical.
Also under review are the
milkround selection interviews
conducted by companies. The
number of companies giving these
interviews has been on the decline
in recent years, with a greater
number of companies requiring
direct applications. A number of top
companies are to be absent from
both careers fairs and milkrounds
this year.
TV Licence Dodgers Christmas Pay-Up
by Gareth Light
Students are to be targeted in the
latest crackdown on television
licence dodgers. Students with a
main operated television set or
video recorder which can receive
public television programmes and
broadcast services must buy a
licence, which currently costs £ 8 0
per year. Failure to comply with the
law could result in a maximum fine
of £1,000.
Brian Sproat, the Managing
Director of T V Licensing, said that
student could use a 'quarterly
budget scheme' to purchase a
licence. The scheme spreads the
annual cost over four instalments,
each of £ 2 1 . 2 5 . The scheme
includes a 'premium' of £1.25 per
quarter.
Students are exempted from
buying a licence for battery
powered televisions, which are
covered by their parents' licence.

Wilson House residents who will be
vacating their rooms over the
Christmas vacation are to have their
rents refunded. Sheelagh
Crampton, Accommodation and
Conference Manager, has agreed
that students will not be charged as
a result of accidental
misinformation sent to them. A
document posted with the letter of
acceptance for a place in the hall
stated that there would be no charge
over Christmas provided the room
was vacated. On arrival at Wilson
House, students were asked to sign
a licence document accepting that
payment would be made over
Christmas in all cases. After
adverse reaction from Wilson
House residents, the rent refund
arrangement was agreed. Students
are now advised to pay their current
hall bills as issued.

Chris Davidson. Imperial College
Union President, is to begin regular
informal meetings with students.
The first meeting will take place this
Monday (26 October) at 1pm in the
Ents Lounge in the Union Building.
The meetings were promised by
Mr Davidson in a post election
interview on IC Radio. At the time,
Mr Davidson said that the meetings
would be modelled on existing Rag
meetings. He added that he would
use the meetings to discuss his
weekly diary, and remarked 'if I
deserve a hard time, I'll be there to
get it'.
Mr Davidson is believed to have
delayed the meetings until the new
term had 'calmed down a bit'.
Other sabbaticals have not indicated
if they will take part in the
meetings, or if they will hold
alternative ones. Mr Davidson has
already said that other sabbaticals
should take part in his meetings.
Rag Total Up
200 Imperial students raised close
on £5,000 during last Saturday's
Monopoly. The final Monopoly
total of £4,648.73 brings the
Imperial College Union Rag total so
far this year to £7,325.96. The
money was raised during London-
wide collections on Saturday, and
an overnight collection in Leicester
Square. This year's event was
slightly disrupted by the current
bombing campaign, and organisers
have also said that the recession was
having an impact on donations.
Tomorrow, Rag will be
collecting for UNICEF in London,
and the first Rag Raid of term will
take place in Cambridge. For full
details, see page 9.
