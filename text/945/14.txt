Stumbling on the Unity Stump
The Pakistan Society invites you to analyse Islam for yourself
The Islamic concept of inter-human
relations, its high ideal of human
brother-hood and the actualisation
of this ideal in history, in contrast
to the antagonism between the
different races of man as preached
and practised by racism, makes
Islam an International religion and
way of life. The concept and idea
of'oneness of humanity' is Islam's
unique contribution to human
civilisation and it comes as a natural
sequel to its cardinal conviction, the
doctrine of the Unity of God.
This doctrine runs through all the
teachings of Islam and the Quran.
The Almighty God, Allah, the one
and only, is the author of all
existence and he is the 'Rabb', the
Cherisher, Sustainer and Fosterer
of each and everything found in the
universe. He has created us all alike
and He deals with all of us alike,
no matter to which race, nation,
tribe or parentage we may belong.
The book of Allah, the Holy Quran,
elucidates this further in numerous
verses and words, such as,
'And mankind is but a single nation'
(Holy Quran 2:213),
'O mankind! We created you from
a single (pair) of a male (Adam) and
a female (Eve), and made you into
nations and tribes, that ye may
know each other not that ye may
despise each other. Verily the most
honoured of you in the sight of God
is (one who is) the most righteous
(and God- fearing) of you. ' (Holy
Quran 49:13).
The second verse quoted above
not only restates the common origin
of man but also explains the division
of humanity into nations or races
and tribes and tells us that the object
and purpose of this division was
also the ultimate unification of
humanity, but it goes a step further
to point out to us the one and only
criterion, the only standard by
which man is judged by God, and
thus by which we should also judge
our fellow- man.
As can be seen, this criterion is
not his colour, nor his race, not his
country, not his social status or
rank, not even his skill or degree
of intelligence, but something that
lies within the reach of every human
being, black or brown, white or
yellow, rich or poor, if only he
makes an effort to cultivate it within
himself. This verse of the Quran is
an answer of Islam to racism and
the problems we are facing today
due to man-made borders, divisions
of territories and the effects of
nationalism. The Islamic idea of
unity and equality amongst mankind
did not remain a pious exhortation
but sounded the death knell of racial
discrimination in the World of
Islam. This is borne out by the
example set by the Holy Prophet,
Muhammed (PBUH), and the
subsequent events in the history of
all Muslim nations as well as by the
general attitude of the Muslims until
the present day. The Islamic Rule
in Spain may be viewed upon as one
such example.
Through all his teachings the last
Prophet (PBUH) of Islam urged his
followers to cling to this Idea of
Unity. On the occasion of his
'farewell pilgrimage' the Prophet
(PBUH) said, 'Ye people listen to
my words and understand them.
Know ye that all Muslims are
brothers unto one another. Ye are
one brother-hood.' This bequest
and the example set by him was
followed by subsequent generations
of Muslims throughout history.
If we look around the world
today, we see the huge differences
between poor and rich, hatred
between black and white,
oppression of the weak nations by
the powerful nations, and the ever-
widening chasm of the living
standards of people of so-called first
world and third world. We Muslims
should believe that this dire
situation is the result of our leaving
Islam as a way of life and we will
find no solution or happiness in any
man- made system or world order.
Without absolute and unreserved
faith in God, and in the truth and
universality of His revelations,
without the will to serve Him,
which is the purpose of our
creation, and to follow His
commandments and guidance
revealed in the Quran, the goal of
equality and fraternity amongst
mankind can never be achieved as
history tells us. There is no road to
the unification of humanity, no road
to a brother- hood of man that
knows no boundary of colour, race,
country, language and social status
except through the one guidance
from God, the Creator and 'Rabb'
of all that is between the heavens
and on earth.
The Pakistan Society's
celebration of Unity Week is a small
step towards increasing awareness
amongst the student community of
Imperial College and to inform
them about the Universality of
Islam, the Deen of Allah, the one
and only God. Everyone is cordially
invited to all these events during this
week, and please come to listen to
the real message of Islam, usually
not taught in modern schools and
often distorted in the western
media.
