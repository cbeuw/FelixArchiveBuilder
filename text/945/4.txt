23 October 1992 Felix 945
Carparking complaint
Dear Jonty
I am writing to you on behalf of
myself and my cosignator Jagdish
Jethwa with regard to the recent
allocation of student parking
permits, knowing that although you
have no say in the matter, you are
the esteemed editor of the august
organ which is the forum for our
dissatisfaction.
I applied, with Jag, for a shared
permit, each of us stating
(truthfully) that in the event of our
successful application we would be
bringing ourselves, two other
students and a member of IC staff
from Clayponds to College. We
were unsuccessful. Questions
spring bountifully to mind:
l . My hearty congratulations to
my colleague who drives daily to
College from Calyponds in a 2(+2)
seater sportscar, but how was his
application deemed more worthy of
notice, that ours?
2. How can any (impoverished?)
student afford a personalised
number plate (q.v. BORING,
GLF123, ish. 944), and how can
said person be seriously in need of
a parking permit? (part of the
justification of a permit supposedly
being the cost of travel).
3. What kind of a registration is
B Townsend? Or A Wimpenny?
Are we to believe that these people
were allocated permits without
having a car? What is going on?
What is the account number and
what denomination of which
currency is required?
4. Could we please see the,
criteria by which the need for a
parking permit is assessed? (Year
of study, saving in time/money
afforded by travelling to/from
College by car, location of
residence, relationship with the
Humanities defended
Dear Jonty,
As last week's front page story on
the new College Day specifically
singled out the Humanities
Programme language courses, I
would be grateful for the chance to
make some comments.
It was agreed by the Board of
Studies last session that from this
October the Humanities Programme
would be allowed to timetable its
classes in the two hours between
12.00 and 2.00pm on Monday,
Tuesday, Thursday and Friday.
(Not the 'College lunch-hour' as
your report states.) Departments
whose undergraduate students are
allowed to take language options
agreed not to timetable any classes
in these two hours. Thus, students
taking a language option should
have at least one hour, either 12.00
to 1.00pm or 1.00 to 2.00pm, free
on each of the three days when they
have a language class.
As a result of the addition of five
hours a week to the timetable, the
numbers of undergraduates signing
on for a language option have gone
up to nearly 1,100 compared with
fewer than 600 last year, when we
had to turn large numbers of
disappointed applicants away. Had
we stayed in the old 'corset' of two
College-wide windows on Tuesday
and Thursday mornings, plus the
odd hour stolen here and there, this
increase could not have taken place.
Even this year, it has not been
possible to give all latecomers the
first course of their choice. On the
whole, however, the new system
seems to have got off to a
satisfactory start.
I would stress two points:
nameless entity who allocates
permits etc). In these times of
supposedly increasing bureaucratic
openness, I can see no reason why
not.
In response to the closing
paragraph of the notification of
successful applications for parking
permits in ish. 944, T hope that you
where (sic) successful', blah, blah;
bollocks, don't be so patronising,
apology not accepted.
Lastly, in preemptive reply to the
obvious retort to this letter, i.e.
'sour grapes'; wrong. I presently
travel to and from College on a
motorcycle. Let me tell you that not
even Benzedrine affords a better
opportunity to arrive at College
quiveringly alert, than having to run
the gauntlet of numerous
manslaughter attempts (taxi-,
Mercedes- and van courier drivers,
et al). Of course this doesn't help
1. These courses are OPTIONS.
No one is forced to take a language
course if he or she wishes to do
something else between 12.00 and
1.00pm or 1.00 and 2.00pm. Life
entails difficult choices.
2. Many undergraduate have
realised that 'Europe' is now a
reality, whatever the outcome of the
current debate on the Treaty of
Maastricht. A knowledge of at least
one European language other than
English (and some of our students
will end up with two) could be of
great advantage in their careers-
leaving aside the wider personal and
cultural benefits which such study
brings. Increasing Japanese
investment in the United Kingdom
and elsewhere in Europe makes
Japanese a useful acquisition. It is
also interesting to note that Russian
Jag and the other poor buggers who
would have been my passengers,
but who must now suffer the pain
that is public transport in London.
Yours devoid of any hope of a
reply from the official concerned,
but sincerely,
J.C. Graham, J Jethwa.
P.S. My case is by no means
unique; another in my Deparment
applied without success for a permit
to travel from Rayner's Lane (Zone
5 for God's sake), again bringing
in three other students, again
without success. Please note also
that in respect ofQ3 above, I do not
intend to imply the offer or
acceptance of any bribe whatsoever,
nor is it my intention to imply such
an offer or receipt exists, and if any
offense has been given I apologise
wholeheartedly and unreservedly to
whomsoever it may concern or
offend.
numbers have risen this year.
Once students have left College
it is very unlikely that they will be
able to find several hours a week in
a busy professional life to study a
language methodically and with the
stimulation of a group of equally
intelligent and similarly motivated
people. Very wisely, more and
more of them are coming to realise
this fact and are prepared to put up
with a little personal inconvenience
in return for what we have to offer.
Incidentally, it is not only
language students who have
benefitted from the new freedom of
the reformed College Day.
Enrolments in subjects such as
Philosophy and History are up by
100% from 248 to over 500.
Yours sincerely,
Eric Stables.
Dear Jonty,
Students at Imperial College have
always been accused of being
apathetic. So it was surprising to
read in last week's Felix (issue 944)
a letter written by Alan Bailey in
response to a leaflet distributed by
the Islamic Society ('Nobby the
Sheep'). He must be congratulated
for having at least thought about the
issues raised in the article although
his letter is one of the most twisted
and ignorant that I have ever read.
This is not surprising, however,
considering the ultra right-wing
views he expressed in last year's
issues of Felix, which many
students will be aware of.
His references to the article in
question are taken out of context
Islam reply
and misconstrued. An example of
which is 'Western culture is brain
dead' which is not explicitly implied
in the original article.
It seems that attacks on the
character 'Nobby' matter very little
to Mr Bailey. But when it comes to
the attack on the beliefs and ideas
held in this country, such as the
attitude to homelessness, rape and
starvation he immediately feels
offense. The fact that the system of
government in this country does not
adequately tackle these issues is
completely missed by him.
Instead he goes for an all out
attack on Islam. The opinions
expressed seem to come more from
'Lawrence of Arabia' and 'Sinbad'
than Islam itself. The examples he
uses to support himself are
completely wrong and do not come
from Islam. Using Saudi Arabia and
Iran as examples of an Islamic state
will baffle many people since both
do not implement Islam in its
entirity.
Another misconception is that
Islam is a religion, when in fact it
is a comprehensive system of life,
i.e. an ideology, covering all
aspects of life. It has answers for
everythingâ€”political, social,
judicial and economic as well as
education, foreign affairs and ruling
etc. It can and has dealt with
problems in all of these areas.
I suggest that Mr Bailey and
anyone else who read the article
shou'd contact anyone from the
Islamic Society to find out what
Islam really has to say about the
issues raised. I, and the Islamic
Society, challenge Mr Bailey and
anyone else who disagrees with
Islam to a public debate, on the
issues raised in the article, his letter
or any other aspect of life. If he is
sincere in what he writes then he
will not act as the intellectual craven
he is taken for.
Yours,
Afzal, member of Islamic
Society.
