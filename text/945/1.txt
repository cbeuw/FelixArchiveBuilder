Knife
Attack
in Hall
by Felix reporters
College security has refused to
comment about an knife attack
inside a Hall of Residence. The
attack took place last Friday, when
a female student was assaulted at
knife point. The assailant is
believed to be the student's ex-
boyfriend. The attack was not a case
of date rape.
The attack occurred inside a Hall
of Residence from which manned
security was removed last Easter.
The attacker, who is not a student
at Imperial, gained access to the
Hall without challenge. The man
then confronted the woman and the
injury occurred in the ensuing
argument. The victim may press
charges.
The actions of College authorities
in the aftermath of the attack have
fuelled rumours that a cover-up is
in operation. The housekeeper of
the hall admitted that the incident
did occur, but declined to make
further comment. College Security
have yet to make a statement on
either the attack or any possible
review of security in its wake. A
number of students from Prince's
Gardens Halls of Residence have
told Felix that this attack is not the
first incident of physical abuse
against female students. Last year,
there was a succession of
complaints about sexual harassment
in the vicinity of Southside Bar.
Students have told Felix that they
were instructed not to talk to the
press about any of the attacks.
Attack alarms are available from
the Imperial College Union office.
Pit Closure: RSM Students March
Several members of the Royal
School of Mines (RSM) took part
in a march in support of the miners
last Wednesday. The march left
Hyde Park just after noon, and
made its way along Bayswater
Road, Camden Hill Road, High
Street Kensington and back to Hyde
Park, where they were addressed by
Arthur Scargill, the President of the
National Union of Mineworkers,
and Dennis Skinner, Labour MP for
Bolsover.
RSM students are particularly
worried by the impact the closures
will have on vacation employment.
3 out of 5 RSM Mining Engineering
students gain vacation work with
British Coal, as 500 hours of mining
experience is required to gain a
Mining Engineering degree. British
Coal, though it does not sponsor
RSM students, has a significant
involvement in mining courses at
Imperial. First year students have
in the past visited mines in
Nottingham, while third year
students attended a week long
course on ventilation at British Coal
pits. British Coal also provided
speakers at management lectures.
Some RSM students have also
expressed concern about future
competition for jobs. Many think
that mining engineers with many
years experience with British Coal
will now be competing directly with
graduates for other mining work.
The RSM will not be directly
affected by recent plans for pit
closures, according to Professor
Tim Shaw, the Dean of the RSM.
Professor Shaw said that British
Coal had not recruited graduates
from the school for several years,
and so the effect of the proposed pit
closures on students would be
minimal. Professor Shaw added that
the threatened closures may lead to
a drop in applicants for mining in
the future, as a downturn in the
industry could be expected.
After a weekend of high political
drama and intense pressure from
Conservative backbenchers, the
closure plans were scaled down last
Monday so that only 10 pits would
close after 90 days, and a decision
on the remaining 21 pits would be
made in the New Year. On Tuesday
night, the Prime Minister
announced that the Commons Trade
and Industry Select Committee
would conduct a full enquiry into
Imperial
University?
At yesterday's Commemoration
Day ceremony, the rector, Sir Eric
Ash, announced a review of
Imperial College's links with the
University O f London. He
described the federal university set-
up as 'sterile' and 'unproductive'.
Imperial College became part of
the University Of London in 1908,
a year after it gained its Royal
Charter, following the
incorporation of the three
constituent colleges, but the
colleges issued University Of
London degrees before the creation
of Imperial College.
The University Of London
currently consists of 23 schools, of
which all apart from Imperial
College are funded through the
University Of London. Imperial
College is funded direct from the
government. Also part of the
federal university are numerous
medical schools. The University Of
London also provides extensive
union facilities which students of all
affiliated establishments can make
use of. These include sports
facilities, currently unavailable at
Imperial.
Following the removal of the
binary line separating Polytechnics
from Universities earlier this year,
several of the larger members of the
University Of London considered
disaffiliation as it was believed that
the title College was perceived as
inferior to that of University.
Disaffiliation would allow Imperial
to use the latter title.
Britain's energy policy. After a one
day debate in the Commons on
Wednesday, most Conservative
backbench rebels voted in favour of
the Government's revised
proposals.
