Pop Will Eat Itself-
The Looks or the Lifestyle
It's the Poppies 4th album to date,
and not having heard much PWEI
stuff before, it was kinda difficult
to review. 'The Looks or the
Lifestyle' is in a typical vein of
PWEI, perhaps a tad more
commercial than its predecessors—
this is reflected by the fact that they
now have employed the talents of
a real drummer (?) in the line up.
Although the album shows great
mixed feelings and moods in places
coupled with consistent
minkfuckingly heavy drum and bass
lines, the carrying beat becomes just
a little boring—the sheer power of
the bass loses itself through the
album only due to the constant
repetition.
Grindingly thrashy guitars also
make an appearance from time to
time, like in the track 'Urban
Futuristic (Son of South Central)'
which is a blend of thrash metal,
techno-rave and babies!
PWEI have well-balanced music
styles in certain tracks in this
album, drawing on influences from
the Far East, gospel and the
aforementioned baby-like vocals.
Although melody, for the greater
part of this album, is swamped in
rhythm, Melodic parts do
sometimes arise.
Anyway, enough general '
rambling, time to present the pick
of the tracks.
'England's Finest' is a typical
intro, a load of wank basically, but
a full 48 seconds after the recording
is put on, the listener is treated to
a wonderfully titled 'Eat me, drink
me, love me, kill me', kicks in.
This gives a good impression about
what 'The looks...' is about. This
track could also become a good
single in my view, although not
dancefloor stuff.
Talking of singles,
'Karmadrome' and 'Bulletproof
are the two tracks lifted so far from
their latest opus. 'Karmadrome' is
an excellent dancefloor track as well
as the most listenable track on the
album. 'Bulletproof, although also
great dancefloor stuff, can only be
dancefloor material.
Other tracks worthy of merit and
of a quick mention are 'Harry Dean
Stanton' and 'Pretty Pretty'.
Not as good as its previous
brothers 'Cure for Sanity' and 'This
is This', it is still a worthy album
(anybody mentions NOT! gets
decked right now). IS
E V E R Y B O D Y HAPPY?

• 'Eat Me...' was a single, the
A A side of 'Karmadrome'.
Released on RCA. The next single

Baddies'.
ULU All Nighter
The freshers' welcome, and what a
welcome it was—well at least for all
those people who haven't been
through it all before; three hour bar
queues, completely over full
concert halls, crap films that
everyone has seen before and far
too many 'happy' couples snogging
in what they think are dark corners.
But aside from all of that it
seemed to be all in all a pleasantly
entertaining evening. Let's start at
the beginning:
The bands—wild entertainment
ranging from the indie scene (man)
to the revival of Abba. Cygnet
Ring: the first band on, two of the
members I knew from when they
were called Playing With Trains
(and what a good album they have).
I always feel at events like these that
they have ordered the bands
completely in the wrong order—big
name does not necessarily mean
good music. However, these guys
were good—they managed to get
the crowd going, keeping up the
music and mixing in sly witticisms
on the standard of their audience—
and were a lot politer about it than
The Wonder Stuff. Cygnet Ring are
playing here on November 6th—
go and see them—it is well worth
the money and the effort.
The Lemon Trees: I only
managed to catch the end of these
guys and to me they sounded far too
mediocre to deserve more than a
three line statement on their
performance, and I didn't even
catch the third band Family Go-
Town —I was far too busy queueing
fot the bar and gyroscope upstairs!
(Poddy's note: I saw them, they
were shit.)
And now for the biggy, Bjorn
Again, the best thing since sliced
Abba. In fact, it has been said that
they are Abba, but unfortunately
they had a car crash and lost they're
memories - a pile of bollocks if you
ask me. They do, however, do the
old seventies' marvels credit. Their
outfits are superb, the accent spot-
on and, what's more, the music is
as accurate as the last lot. A great
stage show includes snippets of
Nirvana, reportedly good friends of
theirs, and Erasure. I have nothing
more to say about Bjorn Again,
except if you hear that they're
playing at a gig near you, go,
dressed, of course, in white knee-
highs, flares and starglittered tops.
But so to the other ventures that
night...
Martin Taylor, hypnotist
extraordinaire and frequenter of
ICU bar (even if it is just to put his
hands up women's skirts to show
them some 'close magic'), put on
a great cabaret show, strippers,
snoggers, wallies, and covered all-
round perversion for the sake of
entertainment.
The bar-fly jumping, gyroscope
(a spinning contraption designed to
make you exceedingly ill), and
various films shown all-evening in
the bar managed to complete an all-
round great night out, but the
highlight of the night must have
been the sight of Mark Leveller
being turned away from the guest
list to make room foi us Felix bods.
S & M
Bjorn Again —
Erasure-ish ep
After 'Abbaesque', Bjorn Again
seem to have taken offence. Their
retaliation is 'Erasure-ish', covers
of 'A Little Respect' and 'Stop!'.
They're not the first band to cover
Erasure, Dollar having been the
most successful, more successful
than Erasure themselves in fact, and
the covers, like 'Abbaesque', are
well known. Unlike 'Abbaesque',
however, the versions on 'Erasure-
ish' are less radical re workings,
though still sounding as if Abba
themselves might have been doing
it. And, while 'Abbaesque' was
slightly tongue-in-cheek, this is out
and out joke material. Bjorn Again
can not be taken seriously, and this
is where this ep will probably fail.
Along with The Joshua Trio, Bjorn
Again, while a superlative live
party, will be filed as not 'serious',
and all the pretentious people who
only buy music to impress their
friends won't buy it, leaving only
the hardcore Erasure fans, and
Bjorn Again groupies to purchase
it. so it probably won't chart.
Whether it deserves to is another
matter. Let your hair down,
suckers.

Grand on Sunday, and The Town

Soup Dragons —Pleasure
The Soupdragons are back again
desperate to try and recapture the
success they briefly held when 'I'm
Free' hit the charts in the summer
of 1990.
Basically 'Pleasure' is just the
opposite of what the title claims.
'Pleasure' is not pleasure. Pleasure
in Soupdragon's terms simply
means more at the plain boring old
Indie dross that this Scottish band
excells in. Forget this single when
you visit H M V or Our Price, save
your travel money and put it to
bet.ter use down in the Union Bar.
