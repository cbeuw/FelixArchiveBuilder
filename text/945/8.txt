Summer events
in accommodation
College accommodation is one of
the major concerns facing new
students when they arrive at
College. Often it is the first
exposure to College procedures that
is encountered. While we are all led
to believe that everything is running
smoothly and working perfectly,
defects both large and small will
occur from time to time. When
problems occur there is a correct
procedure to take.
1. Inform the housekeeper, or
subwarden if there is no
housekeeper. They should then log
this complaint with the maintenance
department in the Sherfield
Building.
2. If it is fixed, make sure you let
your housekeeper know. If it has
not been mended after a couple of
days, go back to your
housekeeper/subwarden and check
that they have reported the problem.
They should then contact the
maintenance department.
3. If the defect has still not been
fixed after a few more days you
should contact Graham Daniels or
Sharine Brown either directly at 15
Princes Gardens (ext 3553) or
through the Union Housing Officer
Nicky Fox, via the Union Office
pigeonholes or in 6M69 Huxley
Building (ext 6776).
It is not a good idea just to send
a petition directly to the
accommodation manager without
going through the above procedure
as it can take longer to rectify the
fault because the right people have
not been contacted.
Last year it was decided by the
Union Housing Committee that all
petitions should be submitted to the
Union Housing Officer to ensure
that the complaints were passed on
to the correct people, and also to
enable major points to be brought
up at the College Advisory Group
of Residences (AGR). This practice
worked very well last year and all
parties concerned would like it to
continue.
On a happier note, here is a brief
resume of some of the work which
the Residence Office has carried out
over the summer.
1. 1040 new beds and bases, 500
mattresses and 2000 rnattress
covers.
2. In all Halls/Houses of
Residence, ceilings and walls,
washed down, carpets steam
cleaned, hard floors stripped and re-
sealed, sanitory fittings re-sealed
and all heating systems serviced and
repaired as necessary.
3. Southwell: One new common
room in House 51 (nearly
complete), four existing common
rooms fully re-decorated and new
carpel has been scheduled.
4. Fisher: Full re-decoration of
common room and creation of a
study room.
5. Beit: Three new large kitchens
fitted and .four small kitchens
re-fitted.
6. Montpelier: New bicycle sheds
in front of basement vaults, new
basement common room and all
baths resurfaced.
7. Holt Villas: New study
bedroom furniture for all residents
and replacement washing machine
and dryer.
8. Southside: A l l curtains
replaced.
9. Linstead: Re-carpet and re-
upholstery of bar (shared expense
with Hall amenities fund).
10. Weeks: New carpet in four
floors of bedrooms and new laundry
machines.
11. Southwell/Willis
Jackson/Holbein: External
refurbishment, redecoration and
pigeon-proofing commenced (due
to end December 1992).
12. Holbein: Complete refur-
bishment of two houses (due to end
December 1992).
If you have any complaints about
the above or any other defects, do
not hesitate to contact me through
the Union Office or ext 6776, as
mentioned above.
The Union Housing Committee
should be meeting the first week in
November. A letter has been sent
to all Wardens asking them to
appoint a Hall/House represenative.
If you are interested in this, try to
get elected to your Hall/House
committee. This year there will be
two new posts on the committee for
representatives from private sector
accommodation. These will be
elected at the next Union General
Meeting.
So all that remains if for me to
wish you a happy and defect-free
year in College accommodation.
Nicky Fox, ICU Housing
Officer.
Your Welfare Service
The Welfare Office is open to all
IC students for confidential advice
and assistance on a wide number of
issues. Stefano Ruis, ICU's Welfare
Adviser can advise on landlord and
tenant matters, poll tax,
immigration queries, financial
matters, benefit entitlement,
taxation, insurance, grants, loans,
college fees, consumer problems
and legal rights, in addition to
anything else you care to enquire
about.
The Office aims to reach all
students in need of advice,
regardless of whether they are home
or overseas, postgraduate or
undergraduate, male or female. Our
opening times and situation within
the Union Office are designed to
achieve this. You will note that the
Office is closed for approximately
one and a half days per week—this
is to allow the Welfare Adviser to
concentrate on casework and
administrative duties which, in
addition to giving advice, are an
essential part of his job. Although
you can ask to see the Welfare
Adviser in an emergency during
these times, when seeking advice,
you are asked to try to keep to the
advertised opening hours.
Remember that we only have one
member of staff in the Welfare
Office. He will do everything he
can to see you on the same day but
there may be times when this is not
possible.
You may have to wait to see the
Welfare Adviser. By asking at
Reception you can find out how
many people are before you in the
queue. Please be patient—it is the
only way in which we can be fair
to everyone. If there is a particular
reason why you cannot wait, please
discuss your needs with the Welfare
Adviser by telephone. It may then
be possible to make an appointment
for you.
Your visit to the Welfare Adviser
will remain confidential at all times
and will not be discussed or
divulged to any third party without
your express permission. The
Welfare Adviser will not disclose
the reason for your visit to anyone
without your agreement. This
means that your business will not
be disclosed to anyone, not even
College, unless you have agreed to
it.
The Welfare Office is
Confidential, impartial advice is offered by Stefano Ruis the ICU Welfare Adviser.
PLUS a wide range of welfare related leaflets and clain forms are available

by the Welfare Adviser is
impartial. You will not be judged
nor will the Welfare Adviser make
any assumptions about you.
If the need arises, the Welfare
Adviser will open a personal file for
you in order to keep casework,
correspondence and to make notes.
You have the right, on request to
see and read this file. The file
remains the property of the Welfare
Office and is kept in strict
confidence.

complain or be unhappy about the
service you receive from the
Welfare Adviser you can state your
grievance in writing or in person,
in confidence, to the President of IC
Union. Your complaint will be
investigated and you will be notified
of any action to be taken.
If you have any suggestions about
the service or ideas for
improvement please feel free to
contact the Welfare Adviser with
your thoughts. We will do our best
tp take on board any ideas or
suggestions which could improve
the service.
