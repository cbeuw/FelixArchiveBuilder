IC 1st team football started their
quest for the league title with a
convincing 6-2 win over a weak St
George's side.
The game couldn't have started
worse for IC as 30 seconds after the
whistle IC keeper Martin Atherton
found himself collecting the ball
from his nets after a sloppy
defensive corner.
But there was no need to worry
as IC's forwards J Motoshed and
Arman Galloway (offside,
referee!!) used to their full
advantage the brilliant passes given
to them by their continental-style
midfield and scored two goals each.
The half ended with the score at 4-2
after the referee had given a
generous penalty to the opposition.
The second half was similar to the
first with IC dominating and J
Motoshed scoring his first hat-trick
of the season with a fine header. R
Dixon brought the goals to six with
what must be contender for goal of
the season, finishing off a six man
passing move with an incredible
volley from the edge of the box.
Special mention must be made to
the incredible number of goals we
missed (the score could easily have
gone into double figures!), but
especially to one by T Botzios who
after having avoided the opponent's
offside trap, and after a 50 yard run
managed to miss with only the
keeper blocking his way.
Next game is on Wednesday 21st
away at Reading for the first round
of the U A U Cup.
We (last year's league champions)
started the new season with
resounding victory over Kings
College Hospital on Sunday.
Everybody in the team played
exceptionally well against a very
strong, defensive opposition, which
will undoubtedly be one of the
toughest teams we come across in
this year's league.
Our defence as ever kept our
goalie very cold and apart from a
fumble from Sue (I've never played
in goal before) MacDonald they
proved pretty impenetrable, with
Sharon, Arlene, and newcomer
Jane kicking all efforts of their
attack back down the pitch.
The midfield showed just how fit
they are and kept the ball moving
with good tackling and passing,
well done to Caroline, Julianna and
Juliette.
The attack were amazing. A
talented Chrstine gave their defence
something to worry about and if it
weren't for some excellent goal
keeping from the opposition the
score would have been much
higher. Jo scored two goals, one
from a very well placed corner from
Jocelyn who also scored the other
goals.
Kings College Hospital play hard
on the pitch but they know how to
party afterwards!
If you'd like to play come along
to the Union Snack Bar at 6.00pm
on Thursdays or get in touch with
me Eleanor Gibson (Captain) in the
Union pigeonhole. Everybody's
welcome.
X-Country Run
What has 36 legs, the apparent IQ
of a goldfish and runs madly around
gas mains on Hampstead Heath for
fun? No, not Norman Lamont on
his day off, but the IC Cross-
country team on their first outing
of the year in the London Colleges
League at Parliament Hill Fields on
Wednesday 14th October. The turn-
out was excellent—eighteen of them
in fact (if your maths is that bad)—a
mixture of experience and new
talent. Not only that, but the
performance was worthy of a good
'didn't they do well?'
In particular, the women's team
got off to a stonking start with
Edwige Pitel, Lenny Rogers and
Maria Raimondi finishing 1st, 3rd
and 6th respectively. The men's
team (members too numerous to
mention by name) finished in a wide
range of positions—sitting,
kneeling, crawling etc...Particular
gold stars go to best newcomer
(Simon Thomas—9th), best
comebacks. (Dave Knight—20th and
Bill Skailes, 26th) and best of the
first year pack (Steve Waite, 32nd).
Thereafter came a further 11
runners placed from 54th to 96th,
giving the 'B' team in particular a
very good start to the" season. Smart
one!

After years of grovelling to the
Felix editor, it has finally happened.
Yes Felix now has a back page for
sports. So all that is required is your
co- operation to fill it.
Any results, reports or decisions
relating to a sports theme will be
placed there from now on. The
results table will hopefully carry the
results from this weeks games - but
only if you let Felix know the score.
The easiest and most practical
method of conveying the result is
by phone (071 589 5111 x3515 or
071 225 8672). Hopefully, this
1. Try to make the article as
succint and to the point as possible.
No one wants to read a whole lot
of drivel that goes on and on and
... (especially me !!). And if
possible supply a photo.
2. Check your article for spelling
abd gramatical errors. This does
speed up the process of printing the
article.
3. If possible submit the report on
disk (either DOS or M A C format).
1 promise to return all submitted
disks.
4. Failing 3. above, please write

If you have an event planned for the dates below

should become a habit for all the
teams just as they've finished their
game and are relaxing in the bar,
convalescing on that oh-so-near
missed oppurtunity to clinch the
match.
As a result of the back page,
more space is now available for the
remaining clubs and societies. But
please note, due to a highly
successful publicity campaign
during Fresher's Fair, we have been
inundated with reports. So here are
a few tips on how to submit an
article.
neatly and clearly on a fresh piece
of A4 paper. The number of
submissions I recieve which are
illegible and incoherent are mind
boggling.
5. Finally submit the article in
time. The deadline is 1pm Monday.
I have produced a schedule to help
in assessing the date on which you
should submit an article. Please
note, if you want to submit a large
article, come and see me or Jonty
a week in advance, so that we may
budget for it.
