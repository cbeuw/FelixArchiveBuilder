24 Hour Fast For Oxfam
Jacob Tompkins of Third World First asks you to take part in this year's
Oxfam Fast and raise money to help relieve suffering among the world's
poorest people. And if that's not enough, there's free beer afterwards!
Hunger and Poverty—the facts
• Up to 18
million people die
of hunger every
year —most of
them women and
children.
• 70% of the
world's poorest
people are
women —and
they're far more
likely than men to
have too little to
eat.
• In 1990 there
were over 180
million
malnourished
children under 5.
• And every day,
36,000 children
under 5 die as a
result of
poverty —one
every 2.4
seconds.
How To Get The Free Beer!
The Oxfam Fast is taking place on
November 6th for 24 hours. The
idea is simple: you give up
something, (not necessarily food),
get sponsored for it and give the
cash to O X F A M . If you raise more
than £ 2 0 you get a free pint at a
Firkin pub on November 7th, and
if the Imperial group together raises
more than £1000, we will get a free
firkin (72 pints of beer) barrel.
What The Money Will Do
By skipping a few meals, you will
show that you care about the
inequalities which lead to 18 million
people dying of hunger every year.
The money raised will help to
relieve poverty and suffering
amongst the world's poorest people.
£5 could buy over 140 tree saplings,
which will help to reduce soil
erosion and increase food
production.
Third World First
The Fast at Imperial College is
being co-ordinated by the ICU
branch of Third World First. Third
World First is a national
organisation of around thirty college
groups. It is non-charitable and is
therefore more direct in its
campaigns than charities such as
Oxfam. The group at Imperial is
very active; it campaigns, educates
and raises awareness on Third
World issues.
How To Get Involved
If you are interested in getting
involved in the Oxfam fast, or if
you want to know exactly what
happens to money given to Oxfam,
then contact us via the Union Office
pigeon holes or come along to any
of our meetings.
Where To Get The Fast Packs
The Fast packs (containing
sponsorship sheets and Oxfam
information) can be obtained from
ICU Third World First, any branch
of Oxfam, the chaplaincy or the
Union Office reception.
