If by some miracle the original title
of this article has been kept, then
I apologise to any fans of Lewis
Carroll. It does however, in a small
way cover the body of the text—
What Happens at them and How are
they run?
Hidden within the Union page of
last week's Felix was a box ad with
the letters U G M at the top. The
chances of any reasonable number
of people understanding the advert
are somewhere close to the chance
of finding cheap and adequate
accommodation within College. So
to explain...A U G M is a Union
General Meeting. It exists for
students to find out what the
Sabbatical and other officers are
doing, have a say in Union policy
or just to air your views on College
and student life.
What should you expect to
encounter at a General Meeting?
Probably Sabbatical Officers giving
reports on what they've been doing.
Don't let these people intimidate
you. They have over 6,500 bosses,
one of which is you. If they're not
doing their job it's up to you to say
so. Sabbaticals can be questioned on
their reports and work for the
Union.
Where does policy come into it?
Any student may submit a motion
to the meeting. This includes a list
of facts and beliefs covering the
proposed policy under the headings:
ICU Notes and ICU Believes . It's
a little like saying, "The Clangers'
was on T V last Friday lunchtime,
I think it's the most in-depth
science-fiction ever produced.' and
then expecting some comments or
debate. The action to be taken as
part of the policy is then listed as
ICU resolves and ICU instructs.
Again, back to those wooly sci-fi
marvels, this could be—'It should
be shown in the evenings to
showcase such powerful art.' Any
amendments to the motion are
debated followed by debate on the
motion and finally a vote.
How are the meetings run? The
chairman controls the meeting by
following rules laid down in the
'Blue Book'. This is a tome kept in
the Union Office covering what is
and isn't allowed at the meeting.
The basic points cover debate
procedure from speeches for and
against motions, requesting and
giving information and procedural
motions (to speed up the meeting).
These will all be described at the
Chris Speaks
A quick reminder that there will be
an informal chance to ask me, and
some other assorted reprobates,
questions over lunch, on Monday in
the Ents Lounge on the ground floor
of the Union Building. Come along
Ents
Welcome to the second chapter of
the event that is Atmosphere.
Playing tonight, in the Union
Lounge are The Bardots, riding
high on a recent wave of critical
success, including two Melody
Maker singles of the week. In the
same vein as Suede, they'll be
playing a glam-influenced set of
indie-rock numbers. They've been
described as.'one of the best new
bands in Britain', 'mesmerising'
and 'simply brilliant' and will be
ably supported by Passing Clouds.
and see what you have been paying
me to do this week, bring your
sandwiches (or better still, buy them
from Da Vinci's).
See you then.
Chris.
There'll be a late bar til lam, disco
til 2am and don't forget the Smile
Zone Happy Hour from
8.30pm-10pm. Tickets are available
from the Union Office priced £2.50

2nd Floor, East Staircase of the
Union Building.

meeting itself.
And finally, to the title again.
Quoracy? I took the liberty of
avoiding the word 'Quorum'. This
is the number of people needed for
a valid meeting—effectiviely, if less
than 300 people are present, calling
'Quorum' closes down the meeting
and no more policy may be passed.
That covers most of it. To find
out more come to the meeting:
A U T U M N U G M , FRIDAY 16
November, 1pm in The Concert
Hall. The motions should be printed
in Felix that day. Motions should
be submitted to the U G M Chair and
the Union Office by 1pm FRIDAY
30th OCTOBER.
