Monopoly and other RAG stuff
An impressive turnout of 200
people for the second Rag event of
term led to a total of £4648.73
collected in one day. This takes
Rag's grand total so far this year to
£7325.96.
Forty of the bravest collectors
turned up at midnight on Friday,
dressed for battle in outfits ranging
from monster masks to togas. The
intrepid band courageously
ventured forth, despite the cruel
wind and biting cold, to lay seige
to Leicester Square. Throughout the
night, any poor soul that dared to
set foot within these confines was
greeted with a great cry of 'Spare
change for Mencap?' and was
forced to empty their pockets of
every last penny.
Having cleaned out audiences
from the Comedy Store and the
Rocky Horror Picture Show, the
merciless can-rattlers proceeded to
the bus-queues in Trafalgar Square,
where they quickly instilled nearly
as much terror in the hearts of the
unsuspecting public as they put
money in their tins.
Exhausted by their own infectious
enthusiasm, the weary collectors
disbanded at around 4am, some
going happily home to bed and
others pressing onwards to New
Covent Garden Market and
Portobello Road. Either route led
eventually to the inevitable - new
cans and a clue sheet collected at
10am for the start of the big event
- M O N O P O L Y !
Basically, this was just another
excuse for conning money out of
shoppers whilst having fun. The
Monopoly rules also encouraged the
amassing of treasure, which this
year was absolutely amazing. Not
only did we not have a room full of
'borrowed' traffic cones, all of your
treasure was very original (except
possibly for Burker
King/MacDonalds' hats and
ballons. For example we had a
plastic leg, cuddly toys from
Mothercare, a pair of yellow
fireman trousers, several
Metropolitan Police arrest warrants,
various traffic warden slips, a
Karaoke tape of 'With A Little Help
From My Friends' and a '20th
Anniversary M u g ' from The
Dorchester. Everyone showed that
'Anything is possible when you
have a R A G can in your hand!'.
Despite a bomb warning at one
of the locations (Bond Street) and
over- enthusiastic collectors being
warned over the PA system at tube
stations, the day finished without
arrests, and the hoards of tired can-
shakers ended by joining comrades-
Raggies and well MET person
in-cans from universities all round 1
the country at a massive Mencap
party at Kings College. A fitting
finale to a fantastic day.
The winning team was 'The
Superteam', who amassed an
average of 13282 points each.
Second and third places were taken
by 'Mo, Steve and Rob' (6041
points each) and 'Undecided' (5664
points each). Congratulations go to
everyone who collected, but in
particular to Vicky Owen for being
the top Fresher collector with
£91.74! London sightseeing guides
will be presented to the members of
the top teams. If you think that you
have won one, turn up at Friday's
Rag meeting (1.10pm, Union
Lounge) to find out.
Well, that's it for M O N O P O L Y
until next year but R A G goes on
stronger than ever, read on for
information on our R A G Raid to
nerd-land (a.k.a Cambridge).
And remember to:
BE M A D ! BE SILLY! B E PART
OF IT!
R A G
RAID
Saturday 24 October sees the first
Rag Raid of term.
A minibus or two full of Raggies
will be going up to Cambridge for
a day of hard collecting and a little
sightseeing and drinking. We will
also be selling our infinitely
superior Rag Mag to any of
Cambridge's students with enough
of a sense of humour to handle it.
The collection will be in aid of
Lepra who, surprisingly enough,
research into and care for Leprosy
victims.
Our Union President is expected
to be a regular feature on most Rag
Raids in the near future; he
promised to raise at least £1000 this
year!
Future Rag Raids include the
annual Poppy Day collection in
Maidstone on 7 November and
another to an, as yet, undecided
destination on 5 December.
If anyone is interested in taking
part in either event, please come
find me in the Rag office or at any
of the Friday Rag meetings.
