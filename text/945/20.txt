Film
Strictly Ballroom
Strictly Ballroom isn't. It's not just
for the dancing fanatic, yet it isn't
Dirty Dancing II. A dancer myself,
I loved the film and was pleased to
see a film about dancing where the
actors could actually dance.!
Ballroom champion Scott is
dumped by his partner Liz and his
hopes of winning the Pan Pacific
Grand Prix shatter. But from the
shadows emerges Fran, a beginner
dancer. The storyline isn't original;
boy meets girl, dons sequins,
throws girl round shoulders.
However, it's done with a style that
sets it above other romantic
comedies. It has quality and off-the-
wall humour that sets the screen
alight.
Romance is thinner on the
ground. Fran is cast in the ugly-
ducking role, but change those
glasses and baggy shirt for a figure-
hugging dress and she is
transformed. The love, though, is
innocent not sexual.
See it in a cinema. It will lose a
lot on video. Director Baz
Luhrmann has captured something
that others have failed to get:
Atmosphere.

Husbands And Wives
Husbands And Wives is Woody
Allen's 22nd film, controversially
released amid his turbulent divorce
with Mia Farrow. It concerns two
middle-aged married couples who,
in turn, temporarily split up and
have unsuccessful affairs, whilst
evaluating questions of commitment
and change.
In this film one can see all the
classic characteristics of vintage
Allen: the occasional and very
funny one-liners, the satirization of
famous psychoanalysts and
novelists, the sudden 'stepping out
of the screen' when the characters
are interviewed (as seen in Annie
Hall and more explicitly in The
Purple Rose Of Cairo), and the
twenties music. But there are some
novel additions, most notably the
photography - the camera is
constantly on the move, following
the characters round with excessive
enthusiasm, never scared to place
itself in the thick of the action. So
it's a bit like watching The Cook
Report and this had the effect of
drawing me deeper into the film.

Strictly Ballroom- encore
Your ex-IC dance team reviewer
was shocked and stunned at this
ludicrous confection of drivel. With
all the directorial subtlety (Baz
Luhrmann) of a Benny Hill show
there is no dirt or dancing. Hunky
Champ Scott Hastings (Paul
Mercurio) dances(?) his own
innovative (ha!) steps in a
competition, and is written off by
all including his partner. Enter
hideous beginner Fran ready and
waiting to metamorphosose into a
feisty, firey flamenco Queen.
Together they take on nobody in
particular—oh—and fall in lurve, of
course. Some of the themes had
great potential, the integrity of the
original versus the corruption of the
establishment, the proud roots of
Ballroom dancing in the earthy latin
rhythms of Andalucia. Unfortunate-
ly a) no one can dance, b) even
fewer can act and c) the music's
crap. Praise be for Fran (Tara
Morice) and her Spanish family
providing the only flicker of dignity
in this dismal, embarrassing film.

Theatre
Marsha Raven & The Blues
Angels
Marsha Raven deserves more than
'A Little Respect' her gritty,
touching, eclectic ramble through
the history of women in the blues,
is a 'must-see' for blues fans,
feminists and fun lovers alike. From
its west African roots through
smoke-filled bars and brothels to
discos and beyond Martha sketches
the metamorphosis with her sweet
sharp talkin' and her even sweeter
singin'. Every 'great' is revered
from Ma Rainey, Billie Holiday,
Ella Fitzgerald to Nina Simone,
Diana Ross and Chakka Khan. She
treats us to a bevvy of unknown
gems and much-loved classics. Her
voice, though not exceptional, rises
wonderfully to the challenge of each
song. Style, timbre and gestures are
captured and conveyed with wit,
skill and a real love for the blues
and its exponents. Thankfully the
sensitive, original piano and
harmonica playing masked some
rough drums and bass in the band.
All this sister needs, girls, is an
appreciative audience and loooodsa
R-E-S-P-E-C-T! Go.
