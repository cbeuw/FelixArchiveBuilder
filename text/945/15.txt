Far and Away Enviro Soc
Real-life husband and wife, Tom
Cruise (Cocktail, Top Gun and
many more) and Nicole Kidman,
appear this week at Filmsoc in Far
and Away, a fine romantic story of
two young Irish people from very
different backgrounds in their
search for their dreams. Ron
Howard, who previously existed as
Richie in Happy Days (you
remember), has grown up into a
director, and following on from
successes like Backdraft he directs
this 140 minute epic, the first film
to be shot in Panavision Super 70
and therefore featuring spectacular
cinematography.
Joseph (Cruise) is a poor farmer
evicted from his home by his rich
landlord, whose beautiful, but
frustrated, daughter Shannon
(Kidman) soon becomes his dream
girl despite her stabbing him with
a pitchfork on their first meeting.
Still, they leave Ireland together on
Batman
ICSF Is rather chuffed to be
showing Batman Returns, director
Tim Burton's second excursion into
the world of the Dark Knight.
Twenty-three years after being
abandoned in a sewer, the Penguin
(Danny DeVito) plans a diabolical
revenge on Gotham City. Aided by
ruthless industrialist Max Schreck
(Christopher Walken), the dastardly
Penguin does battle with Batman

As you were wandering around
Freshers' Fair did you have a faint
nagging doubt? A feeling that the
College was not quite complete?
Well, maybe you didn't—but I did.
I looked and looked and scoured my
Union Handbook and YES, I was
right, Imperial College does not
have a debating society. A group of
nearly 10,000 intelligent,
presumably literate, interesting and
interested young people have no
facility whatsoever to participate in
argument and discussion on a
purely intellectual level.
Some may say—'What use has a
Scientific University for poofy, arty
things like debate?'. All too often
scientists are accused of being
unable to communicate their ideas
in a way that appeals to and is
understood by those who are less
informed than themselves. This is
a skill taught by debate.
Others may say—'We organise
a journey across America, fraught
with danger and full of fun. He
turns to bare-knuckle fighting for a
living, and teaches her to survive
without the servants she is used to,
while she tries various jobs from
plucking chickens to can-can
dancing. Humour is scattered
throughout the film, and there's
plenty of action, as well as a
sprinkling of soppy bits.
This film is worth seeing, for the
Dances with Wolves style 'animals
racing across American Plain'
finale, the admittedly dodgy ending,
and Cruise and Kidman's sad
attempts at Irish accents. Everyone
will enjoy this film, so come and see
it, on Thursday 29th October at
7.30pm in Mech Eng 220. You can
get in for free if you become a
member at Filmsoc (membership
£6.50), otherwise entrance is 90p
for existing members and £1.90 for
non-members. See you there.
(Michael Keaton). Meanwhile,
Batman's alter ego Bruce Wayne
unwittingly falls in love with the
voluptuous Catwoman (Michelle
Pfeiffer).
Doors open at 6.45pm in Mech
Eng 220 on Thursday. Membership
costs £3 (first film entry free) while
subsequent films cost just £1 to get
into. Can you say no to a whip-
cracking Michelle Pfeiffer, encased
in skin-tight rubber?
debates within our societies. If you
want to argue, join us'. However,
who should organise these debates
on such pertinent topics as 'This
house believes that there are fairies
at the end of the garden' or on a
range of emotive issues from sex,
through religion and politics to
television and beer.
Those of you who have debated
before or ayone who fancies
themselves as a Mark Anthony or
Margaret Thatcher, and would be
keen to set up a debating society
please contact Christopher
Hodge—Chem 1 or at Room 18
Garden Hall—ext 823.
I look forward to meeting you all
to discuss this further. Please
remember that your political or
religious beliefs are entirely
relevant, all that is required is a
good judgement and the ability to
leave your prejudices at the door.
See you soon.
Numerous opportunities exist
within London for active
conservation work. Over 30% of
Greater London consists of open
space within which London
Wildlife Trust, the UK's largest
urban wildlife organisation manages
60 nature reserves. These
increasingly threatened green
spaces are vital havens for wildlife,
are valuable educational resources
and provide the 'green lungs' of the
city.
The Trust relies on corporate
sponsorship and membership fees
(£7 per year for students) for funds
but the bulked of the work is carried
out by part-time volunteers at a
local level.
Local groups now cover 28 of the

We kicked off our first match

the infrastructure in which
important practical work and
campaigning can be carried out.
Tasks include digging, fencing,
building nestboxes and surveying.
Talks, walks, and social events are
also organised. In total more than
200 free events are advertised in the
Trust's four-monthly magazine
'Wild London'.
This is available in the
Environmental and Appropriate
Technology Society's section in the
Haldane Library, while the most
local or 'interesting' events are
publicised in the Society's
newsletter or on the noticeboard

Alison Pool, Biology 3.
fielded a strong side, and on
account of this we succumbed to a
6-2 defeat. This has to be seen as
a minor upset as opposed to a major
set-back since we will be playing
them at IC later in the season.
