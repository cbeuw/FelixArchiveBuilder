DRUGS
DRUGS
Let’s talk about Drugs #realtalk
D
o you know why
some drugs are
called ‘Drugs’
with a capital
D? Or why your
school was so
eager to drill into you that
some things are bad no-
questions-asked-because-
I-said-so during those
insufferable PSHE lessons?
Why some substances are
kept completely out of our
reach and have a seven year
sentence attached, while
others have the privileged
liberty of being sought and
found not just at the chemist’s,
but even at the off-license?
Let’s scrutinise rationally,
calmly and scientifically on
the question of why drugs
are such a big deal, and why
everyone appears to believe
what they do, by examining
the drug MDMA and its
potential utility. Let’s do away
with the lies for good, and
uncover the truth, shall we?
MDMA was synthesised
by Merck in 1914 and was
largely left untouched until
psychotherapists in the 1970’s
began applying this agent,
along with other recreational
substances such as LSD, as a
compliment to normal talking
therapies for helping treat
patients with depression,
anxiety and a host of other
psychiatric problems. By
the early 80’s, the drug was
used an estimated 500,000
times in therapy. Reports of
toxicity or abject therapeutic
failure were non-existent,
though rigorous studies as
to its efficacy were in the
same quandary. The drug
eventually leaked from the
therapist’s couch and perme-
ated into the emerging youth
culture of raving nightclubs.
An abyss of scientific igno-
rance about the risks and
benefits of the drug, coupled
to widespread recreational
use and controversial cases
of death associated with the
drug, subsequently led to its
ban. It was labelled a Class
A substance, one “of minimal
to no medical use”, joining
the ranks of cocaine, heroine
and meth. This stands true in
the majority of countries in
the world, since most drug
policies follow the guidance
of the UN Single Convention
therapeutic use. Something
has changed however. The
past decade has seen a
heroic effort to recommence
its safety and efficacy testing,
along with its utilisation in
small cohorts of psychiatric
patients with severe treat-
ment-resistant and debilitating
conditions like post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD). It has,
and I speak free of hyperbole
here, demonstrated the
magic-bullet-like properties
of an antibiotic, and the
clinical safety of a teacake.
Study after study is building
on the evidential base that
it appears to be one of the
most promising psychothera-
peutic tools ever found, with
a myriad of potential uses
in everything from social
anxiety to end-of-life care.
The caveat here is of course
that pure controlled-dos-
age MDMA used in a safe
clinical setting could not be
more different to poly-drug
Ecstasy use in a nightclub.
With MDMA, not a single
significant adverse effect has
occurred in any of the 1133
patients so far tested, and
many large epidemiological
studies are demonstrating that
its risks are marginal taken
as an isolated compound.
One large epidemiological
study concluded that having
two pure MDMA tablets
is the equivalent of having
1.5 cigarettes in standard
measures of adversity for
your health. Moreover, much
of the older research on the
the famous Professor Nutt
at Imperial who spearheads
research in this field “all drugs
can be harmful under specific
circumstances” and MDMA
is truly no exception – but in
light of new rigorous evidence
it appears that its therapeutic
window appears to be far
away from its toxic window,
enshrining its status as one of
the safest psychiatric drugs
ever to be tested.
MDMA’s recreational use,
in the form of Ecstasy, is an
area of much speculation
and concern, however.
Ecstasy contains very variable
amounts of MDMA (often
none at all) and is usually
mixed with other substances
such as methamphetamines.
Ecstasy when used on the
streets has been linked to
deaths from dehydration,
over-hydration, seizures and
life-threatening high blood
pressure. Roughly 20 people
die from it annually. There is
some consensus that very pro-
longed, heavy and frequent
use can have some unpleas-
ant effects – although such
a modicum of application is
seldom seen, as its addic-
tive capacity is very low.
The risks observed are also
confounded by the fact that
Ecstasy use is also frequently
associated with the use of
other drugs, such as cocaine,
which is known to cause seri-
ous health problems. Taken in
isolation and in moderation,
however, some indicators of
the relative safety of Ecstasy
include its listing as the 17th
least damaging drug of those
commonly taken in the UK
(compared to alcohol which
came top, and tobacco which
came 6th). Its risk to others,
and to society generally,
was virtually non-existent,
given the nature of the drug.
One study showed the risk
of death per Ecstasy tablet,
even in its impure form, is one
in two to four million, indeed
usually as a result of either
the tablet’s impurity, irrespon-
sible and excessive drug use,
or ingestion in a dangerous
environment often along-
side other drugs. It appears

MDMA use, in the form of

What has happened since
the fateful events of the 80s?
It is still widely used – more
than 60 million tablets of
Ecstasy are consumed annu-
ally in the UK alone. It is still
a Class A drug, carrying a
hefty seven year imprison-
ment for possession, and free
from governmental acknowl-
edgement of any potential
safety of MDMA that was
used to inform our drug
policies is now under heavy
criticism for having poor
scientific rigour, significant
bias, and tenuous, or even
purposefully inflammatory,
conclusions. In the words of
Ecstasy, are very small. Nutt
even wrote a controversial
paper comparing the risk of
horse-riding (with 100 deaths
annually) to ecstasy use
demonstrating the absurdity
of our unscientific and often
hypocritical approach to
what at bottom appears to be
a question of private leisure.
It seems we are accumulat-
ing more evidence in favour
of its use, and against its
Class A classification – but
an important and necessary
acknowledgement to make
is surely that its use has to be
in the correct context and for
the correct population, or else
the risks do truly tally up, and
the benefits diminish.
Much obscurantism and
poor science encapsulates
the discussion of MDMA, and
indeed many false inferences
are made upon it by drawing
on the behavioural and soci-
ocultural practices inherent to
Ecstasy use, which as we have
seen is quite different. A false
deduction is recurrently made
that the evidence of its (mar-
ginal) risk when used on the
streets acts as evidence for
the ineligibility of the provi-
sion of MDMA as a pure drug
in a controlled environment
under the supervision of a
licensed medical practitioner.
It is the equivalent of banning
painkiller use by doctors
because there are addicts
that abuse heroine. Worse
yet, it is banning their scien-
tific research. The debate and
inquiry is shut down before it
can even begin. Thankfully,
such an infarct to reason is
in gentle recovery, as the
enormous chasm between
the practices of therapeutic
MDMA use and recreational
ecstasy use are under contin-
ued exegesis.
MDMA works by signifi-
cantly increasing serotonin
levels in your brain – the
chemical responsible for pos-
itive feelings and intonations.
It immerses people in feeling
of ‘love, connection and trust’
and is generally a highly
positive experience, though
some feelings of anxiety and
restless are documented.
Most notably, it fosters a shift
towards openness, emotional
candidness, and introspec-
tion. This allows people to
talk honestly, and indeed
positively, about themselves,
their lives, their relationships,
and the world at large,
free of the tinted glasses of
neuroses and self-conscious-
ness that usually encumber
us. It is not a magic bullet for
solving the problems of the
mind in itself, but is instead
seen as a ‘catalyst’ that
greatly amplifies the power of
established talking therapies.
MDMA’s effects are distinct
of the biggest difficulties in
therapy, whilst also being one
of the biggest predictors of
therapeutic success. When
this open channel of commu-
nication is grounded, a well
trained therapist can work
with a patient to facilitate an
introspective and reconcil-
iatory analysis of personal
issues, nurturing an alternate
perception of certain unpleas-
ant experiences or thoughts.
Unlike the drug’s eight hour
effect, the revelations are not
fleeting. It may sound like
wishful thinking to some, but
numerous studies are now
demonstrating this to be per-
fectly true. For example, five
years after follow up of PTSD
treatment with MDMA in a
rigorous study performed in
2011, it was shown that 85%
of patients were successfully
and permanently treated
after just three doses, leaving
many free of the disease,
along with the burden of
medication and therapy. Com-
pare this to the current ‘gold
standard’ therapies for PTSD,
with poor uptake and terrible
efficacy, and they begin to
look like constructions of
pseudo-scientific ignorance
mental health disorders.”
There is much discussion of
MDMA’s potential bene-
fit for a myriad of serious
mental health conditions, as
well as for the treatment of
less severe but nonetheless
unpleasant problems such as
generalised anxiety disorder.
No doubt the confines of
its applicability will only be
expanded further as science
progress.
Psychedelics perfectly
elucidate an interminable
encounter between science
and policy, and a gap
between the evidence and the
action. But how does such a
predicament arise? A core
component has to be a con-
flict of values. The scientific
relentlessness for truth, inextri-
cably entangled with disdain
for non-evidence-based,
non-deductive, logic-skewing,
biased decisions (in other
words, bullshit) appears to be
in direct conflict with much of
politics, for obvious reasons.
Amplify the depravities
we’re in once the vermin
of irrational thought are
demonstrably and unfailingly
applied for decades to shape
our world, when society not
only endorses such mistakes
but feels positively smug
about them, and when much
of the scientific community
itself is infiltrated by the
nonsense of a brain-washed
mob. Finally, compound this
by making millions of lives
depend on our answers to
these questions, and there
you have it – a zero-sum
battle between reason and
irrationality, from which only
one victor can emerge, and
indeed must emerge. Many
of our current problems exist
and persist under this ignoble
climate – but perhaps one
of the most salient exam-
ples remains the question of
recreational substances and
their role in society.
We still exist in the midst
of an age-old gridlock, but
several years of relentless
study, jaw-dropping results,
and public engagement,
have infiltrated the frontiers
of prejudice and misinfor-
mation about MDMA, and
commenced dispersing the
unfounded. Though the
process has been slow, we
are now living through a psy-
chedelic renaissance. In the
words of Sessa “substances
such as MDMA − as well
as other psychedelic drugs
including psilocybin, ketamine
and LSD − could hold signifi-
cant potential as adjuncts to
traditional treatment models.”
When 16 million people
in the UK alone will suffer
from a debilitating mental
health problem, things are in
desperate need of change, as
millions of minds, and indeed
millions of lives, depend on it.
The research is beginning
to reflect this reality, with
many more studies under
way. This situation, along-
side numerous others, also
highlights the imperative of
disseminating an understand-
ing of the scientific method
to all, empowering normal
people with the ability to
discern good evidence from
bad evidence, the capacity
to equate benefits and risks,
and the power to observe
the workings of politicians
and scientists alike with a
critical eye – in essence, a
self-owned filter for truth. The
scheduling of MDMA, along
with many other potentially
therapeutic drugs, as Class A
substances, has discouraged
and obfuscated systematic
clinical research in this area,
and hindered the applica-
tion of treatments that are
showing significant, indeed,
mind-blowing, potential to
improve many lives at small
costs. This is a question not
just of science and truth, but
one of morality. It appears
that, slowly, logic and
compassion are subjugating
taboo, ignorance and vested
interests, and in so graceful
a way as only demonstrable
by the beauty of science. The
only question is – when will
the policy catch on?
from other substances, in that
it does not distort cognition or
perceptiveness, leaving the
user perfectly aware of real-
ity and clear in thought and
consciousness. In the absence
of defensive conditioning,
anxiety and fear, a seamless
platform for trust and open
communication is established
– this, indeed, is usually one
from the Iron Age.
But it does not begin or end
with PTSD, or even MDMA.
Psychiatrist Dr Ben Sessa, a
huge advocate of adjunctive
psychedelic use in therapy,
has said that “despite 100
years of modern psychiatry

ues to underpin the clinical
