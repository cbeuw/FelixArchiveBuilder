hill. Happy thoughts. Breathe in,
breathe out. This issue is about self-care,
which, ideally, would have involved me
taking a holiday and getting my tan on,
maybe on a small, secluded beach in
the Canary Islands. But obviously I can’t
just leave you guys hanging. How are you supposed to
do the puzzles and stare at naked people if we don’t
put together an entire 40-page package of content?
I kid. Obviously felix is part of my self-care/self-harm
routine, as it is for many of our editors and writers.
Which is why this felt like a natural theme for us to go
along with (in case you’re wondering where all the
self-care content is #stfu).
At the same time this is a very appropriate time for
a self-care issue. Everyone is at their limits, having
miraculously endured another term at Imperial.
Whether you guys just finished your exams, or
you’re about to start them, or your final-year project
is about to kick off, or you have a viva to prepare
for, or a dissertation that you’re frantically writing, or
you’re being put through any of the countless torture
mechanisms Imperial has meticulously developed...
maybe just take a break. Watch that movie you’ve
been meaning to watch since the beginning of term.
Or read that book that’s been sitting on your bedside
table since Xmas. Or sit by the window staring at the
ceiling while you’re eating a tub of Ben&Jerry’s. You
know, treat yo’ self.
Especially if you’ve been running an election
campaign. Stop worrying. You’re gonna win. It’s not
like you have any competition. And if you don’t win,
embrace the miracle which will allow you to get on
with your life and enter the real world where taking
breaks is a legit thing.
I’m serious. Take care of yourself ‘cause it’s not like
there’s anyone else around to pick up the slack.

“I don’t appreciate equating Switzerland with Dignitas/assisted suicide as one of the commenters did. I think the comparison is in bad taste
and it treats the issue of assisted suicide far too lightly. Switzerland takes a progressive stance on the subject and I wish, no matter the out-
come, other countries had a similarly mature discussion on the issue, instead of joking about it.
Also, if any such equivalence would be drawn between other countries on a different subject, people would shout racism! Which, for the
record, I don’t I’m just saying it’s in bad taste. I hope you can edit this stuff in the future.
Best,

Do you even edit brah?

ast Friday the Royal
School of Mines
(RSM) building had
to be closed off while
a crew of firefighters
investigated a
potential chemical spill.
Emergency services were
called to the site after a
member of staff detected
an unidentified smell in one
of the labs following the
movement of a bottle. This
resulted in the closing off of
Prince Consort Road and the
dispatch of two fire engines
ChemicalspillcausesclosureofRSM
Four ambulances and two fire engines were called to the site
and four ambulances.
It remains unclear what the
unidentified chemical which
the member of staff detected
was. One student told felix it
might have been Hydrochlo-
ric Acid, a clear, poisonous
liquid which is highly corro-
sive, meaning it immediately
causes severe damage, such
as burning, on contact.
Another student in a neigh-
bouring lab told felix "I was
in the lab next door and it
smelled so chemically."
The staff member
responsible for identifying the
smell and three students were
taken to hospital as a precau-
tionary measure.
Control of the RSM building
was handed back to College
that afternoon.
The staff and students
affected have since been
discharged according to a
College spokesperson.
College will be investigating
the incident further. The RSM
building is now operating
again as normal.

wut?
huh?
An excerpt from the article in question:
“Of course the title of this article is inflamma-
tory. I’m not really suggesting that he should
register for the Dignitas™ treatment, but
looking at it this way, Labour was already on
life support, and Jeremy is helping to assure
that the Labour Party is on the train to Bern”v
Definitions of racism from the Oxford
Dictionatry:
1 Prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism
directed against someone of a different
race based on the belief that one’s own
race is superior. ‘a programme to combat
racism’
1.1 The belief that all members of each
race possess characteristics, abilities, or
qualities specific to that race, especially so
as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to
another race or races.
‘theories of racism’
Plot twist
Thanks for your feedback Swiss Tom!
