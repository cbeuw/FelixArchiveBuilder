SEX
Self love | if you can’t love yourself how in
the hell you gonna love somebody else
Toys for girls
If you’re a girl and you’ve
never tried a sex toy,
that’s absolutely fine. It’s
your body and you should
do with it as you please.
I do feel, however, that if
you weren’t aware of the
existence of sex toys, you
should probably know
about them. There are a
wide range of dildos and
vibrators available online,
often for very reasonable
prices. By this point, as far
as I’m aware, the taboo
is mostly dead. If you
haven’t picked one up yet,
nobody is judging, so why
not have a pop?
Lube
If you’ve never tried lube
during a solo session, you
really should. If you’re a
circumcised male, you’re
probably used to lubricat-
ing your wanks. If you’re
a girl or a member of the
foreskin flock, you might
not have considered the
pleasures of a slippery
hand. Get a towel, sit
down and get yourself a
bottle of lubricant. I per-
sonally recommend J-lube,
an ex-veterinary lubricant
which comes in powder
form, which you can dilute
in a protein shaker. If you
can’t be bothered with the
hassle, grab yourself a
silicon/water hybrid lube.
You’d be surprised what a
difference it can make.
Fleshlights
There’s a certain stigma
B.C. Maile
attached to fleshlights.
Perhaps people see it as
a symbol of acceptance
that you’re not likely to
get much action, but I
think those people can go
fuck themselves. Nearly
everybody wanks, and
everyone who wanks
shouldn’t feel ashamed
about trying to make
it feel better. You can
pick up a penetrable toy
for about £25, and the
difference it makes is
pretty worthwhile. It’s not
quite an everyday thing.
There is a bit of prep and
clean-up required, but for
those wastey hangover
days it’s perfect. Fill up
a sink with hot water and
leave your equipment in
there to warm up a bit.
Get some lube, and the
rest is fairly self explan-
atory. I’s recommend
you make sure your toy
is silicone. That way it
lasts a long time and it’s
dishwasher safe for easy
clean-up.
Rubber gloves
We’re starting to get a bit
alternative now. Rubber
gloves are cheap and add
a new range of sensa-
tions to the masturbation
experience. The slightly
reduced sensation on the
hand gives a novel feeling
which can be a lot of fun.
If rubber isn’t your thing,
you could try other sorts
of gloves to see if any-
thing hits the spot.
Bum fun for boys
If you’re a guy, you’re
likely scared of having
something in your bum.
That’s perfectly natural.
You’ve probably lived
your whole life only expe-
riencing things coming out
of it. Unpleasant things.
I’m not going to say that
the first time you try stick-
ing something up there
will be a totally comfort-
able experience, but I
sill say that perseverance
can yield unprecedented
reward. If you ever pluck
up the courage, have a
little google and work out
where your prostate is.
Aim for that with a finger
while masturbating. If you
get it right, you’ll under-
stand why it’s a thing.
F-machine
What if I told you could
delegate all that hard
work of pleasuring one of
your orifices to something
which wouldn’t cramp or
fatigue? If that sounds
appealing to you, and
you have an open minded
friend in mech-eng or
a decent budget, you
could consider a fucking
machine. If that sounds
interesting to you, google
F-Machine and see what
you think.
Electro
This is probably a new
one for most of you, but
if you’re an experimen-
tal type, it’s worth a try.
Small electrical pulses can
yield interesting sensa-
tions. They don’t always
have to be painful, but if
you’re into that kind of
thing then it’s obviously
on the cards. If you look
in the right place, you can
get yourself electrodes
for the skin, insertable
electrodes or electro
wands, which provide a
large area of contact on
the end of a long handle.
You’ll also have to pick
up an electrostim box
to plug them into. These
allow you to control the
pulse frequency, intensity,
choose the waveform of
the pulses. Sometimes they
even have an audio input,
so you can sync your sexy
shocks to your favourite
song.
Sounding
This is the last one on the
list, and probably the most
controversial. Sounding
is a name given to the act
of putting things up your
urethra. I can’t person-
ally comment on this but
I’ve been told it’s like
masturbating from the
inside. Generally, it’s wise
to start small, but with
experience, upgrading to
larger sizes is possible. If
you look online, you’ll find
sets of urethral sounds
with a range of girths. It’s
very important here that
you look at reviews and
make sure your product is
sterile to avoid infection.
It’s generally not advisa-
ble to put random objects
up your dick hole, so if
you want to try this you
have to go slow. Make
sure you have a set of
smooth, clean sounds.
If any of these things
have enlightened you or
sparked an interest, I’m
glad to have done my job.
If not, then there’s always
next week. Have fun and
love yourself responsibly.
