According to the philoso-
pher Becker, there may be
a strange motive for these
strange eating habits. Per-
haps we as humans feel guilty
for having such large, easily
whetted appetites, for having
flesh that takes up space just
to consume more flesh, and
so we succumb to regimented
consumption, rules and restric-
tion, and in doing so easily
forego all the classic signs
of the human condition that
remind us of our inevitable
immortality – ageing, illness,
and maybe even just feeling
old. So if we cannot escape
death, at least someone like
X can say, “well at least I did
everything right, right?”

There is no One Infallible
Diet. There is just food, enjoy-
ment, and awareness.
F
ood waste is a
global problem.
As per the Food
and Agriculture
Organization (FAO),
over 870 million
people are malnourished
and the figures will grow in
the future with increase in
population.
To study factors which con-
tribute to food waste across
the globe, researchers at the
University of Edinburgh in the
United Kingdom, used data
from United Nations’ FAO.
They found that overeating

developing world consumes
20-30 percent more calories
than the recommended daily
requirement. Over-eating is
now also considered a major
driver behind waste.
Using the data collected by
the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organisation, the
researchers examined ten key
stages involved in the global
food system that included
growing and harvesting of
crops and food consumption,
using the data to quantify the
total waste that occurs.
It was found that around
10% of the food produced
globally is lost to overeat-
ing and over 9% lands up
in the dumpsters. This is the
first study that acknowl-
edges overeating as a way
of wasting food. There are
studies that report that an
average person from the
developing world consumes
20 % -30 % more calories
than their daily requirement.
This is termed as a waste as
even though the food is being
eaten, the person eating
it does not benefit from its
consumption. Especially as it
leads to problems like obesity
and increased risk of heart
diseases.
According to the United
Nations Food and Agriculture
Organisation, over 870 mil-
lion people around the world
suffer from malnourishment.
While on one hand people
are trying to find solutions to
eradicate hunger and find
ways to ensure global food
security for the future, most
of the food that is produced
lands up in the dumpster. It
has been estimated that an
average household in the UK
throws away as much as sixty
pounds worth of food each
month. Also, North America’s
and Europe’s combined dis-
posal amounts to nearly 2.1
billion tonnes of food, a quan-
tity that is equivalent to the
annual crop produced in the
entire sub-Saharan region.
Our dependency on
livestock for meat and dairy
\\ In addition to the
food that is thrown

and meat consumption were
two leading causes behind
food wastage.
According to the research-
ers, “we are growing more
food than required for nutri-
tional needs”. For example,
a study (but not from the
same group) noted that an
average person from the
products is another major
driver contributing to 40%
of the food that is lost. 1.08
billion tonnes of the crops that
are grown and harvested are
used up to produce only 240
million tonnes of animal prod-
ucts, such as meat, dairy and
poultry. The quantity of grain
that is grown to feed livestock
in the US can alone feed over
800 million people. There-
fore, the growing demand
for meat and other animal
products not only decreases
the efficiency of the food
system but also increases the
greenhouse gas emissions,
depletes water consumption,
and also results in great
losses to biodiversity.
The global human popu-
lation is expected to rise by
50% by 2050. This translates
to more mouths to feed
and less land to grow our
crops. Findings of this study
raise concerns and point
out challenges on how the
world population can be
provided with a sustainable
and secure supply of good
quality food. Most of the food
that is wasted comprises of
vegetables, fruit and cereals
and up to 80% can be
salvaged by better manage-
ment and storage practices.
Also, rethinking our dietary
patterns and restricting our
food consumption to our nutri-
tional needs, which includes
reducing our dependence
on animal products, will to a
large extent help reverse this
trend, the scientists believe.

let lie fallow when we are
too tired to think about it (for
some people). It is true that
X’s diet culture, that is clean
eating, may indeed be a
means of trying to harness
some sense of immortality
in the face of mortality,
attempt to transform the
body into some perfect
form. As humans who dine
on everything from plants
to meat to chalk, we are not
satisfied with the bamboo
shoots pandas happily gnaw
at on a daily basis.
We want variety, satisfac-
tion and flavour. And yet,
we are the only beings who,
though so excited when it
comes to trying new foods,
are still somewhat petrified
by them, out of an evolution-
ary averseness to toxicity.
We have to think about and
negotiate trivial food matters
before we can walk or read,
how crazy is that? Back to
clean eating, X has told me
