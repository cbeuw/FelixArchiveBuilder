he first thing that
comes to mind
when you mention
pole dancing is
pretty obvious. The
sexual connotation
it carries will remain for
as long as clubs continue
to offer such services, but
there is a sporting aspect
to it as well that, though
rather well-known as well, is
almost certainly not the first
thing one would associate
with pole dancing. That
pole dancing is indeed a
form of sport is advocated
by plenty of pole instructors
and societies out there,
Imperial’s very own Pole and
Aerial Society being one of
them, and after covering the
London Pole Varsity 2017
for felix’s sport section last
Saturday, I must say that I
completely agree with the
notion. Considering that my
knowledge and ability to
appreciate anything with
the word ‘dance’ in it, pole
or not, is comparable to that
of a potato, combined with
pole dancing being almost
non-existent in my home
country (hence I’d never seen
a pole dance prior to last
Saturday), it must’ve been
mighty impressive. Good
news IC Pole and Aerial: it
was indeed!
First up on the day was
a guest performance by
IC’s very own Melissa Lee,
starting her routine with
some dance moves before
proceeding to pull off some
otherworldly acrobatics on
the pole. The beginners’
category, in my opinion
hardly ‘beginner’ at all con-
sidering the athleticism in
the contestants’ moves,
commenced afterwards and
was followed by a lunch
break. Head judge Lauren
Elise kicked off proceedings
after the break with a guest
performance that had the
crowd delighted and myself
dumbfounded, at one point
in her routine pulling off an
immensely challenging move
that I can describe as nothing
fitness and strength, let
alone the intermediates’, but
the contestants showed me
exactly how it’s done. With
some truly challenging moves,
like doing full splits while
hanging upside down, and
spinning while suspended
upside down and holding
onto the pole solely by the
strength of their thighs no less,
it was then that I mentally con-
firmed with myself that pole
2nd
in Alina’s case), while UCL
finished overall champions.
Your cue, Memeperial.
Well, a review by a total
novice is hardly the most reli-
able account of this event, but
I must say that through all the
cringing from time to time at
what I imagine must be a ter-
ribly painful move I’m seeing,
I’m thoroughly impressed
with what I saw. From the
beginners to the advanced,
answer:
“If you can’t appreciate
what I’m doing on the pole,
then that’s your loss because
you shouldn’t be focusing on
what I’m wearing, you should
be focusing on the moves that
I’m doing.”
Her answer indirectly sends
a message that pole dancing
also empowers. The cliché
about not being afraid of
what others say certainly hold
true for something shrouded
with a negative image like
pole is. I was also able to
speak to Lauren and ask for
her opinion on this, and she
agreed:
“They come in with body
confidence issues, and they
can do something where they
feel powerful, and they can
make whatever they want.
It’s completely up to what
you want to express and it
really gives you a really nice
platform to do that.”
Well, if the purpose of Pole
Varsity was to cast a different
light on pole dancing, then it’s
definitely been a success in
my case. In more ways than
simply because I’ve never
seen a pole dance before, it’s
been an eye-opener for me.
It’s given me the confirmation
that pole is, in fact, a sport,
and that it can empower as
much as it can keep one fit.
Great job, Pole and Aerial,
and keep up the good work!
short of incredible.
The intermediate category
took place after, the athleti-
cism in the contestants’ moves
a step up from the beginners’.
After that, the next category
was preceded by a guest per-
formance as before, this time
by Renata “Renee” Sprenger,
before moving on to the high-
light of the day: the advanced
category. Already, I could
scarcely imagine how anyone
could top the beginners’
dancing is, in fact, a sport.
This was as much a display
of fitness, raw power and
strength as it was artistic.
In any case, group per-
formances by UCL and IC
followed, before the prize-giv-
ing session brought the event
to an end. Imperial’s Alina
Paduraru, Hayley Leung
and Brandon Tsang all took
2nd
place in the beginners,
intermediate and advanced
category respectively (a joint
the contestants all gave
performances that combined
strength, fitness, athleticism
and finesse so well.
That aside, no coverage of
an event is complete without
interviews of any sort. I man-
aged to speak with Melissa
and have her answer one of
the more difficult questions
about pole dancing: how do
you dispell the sexual conno-
tation pole dancing carries?
I must say, I rather like her

ast weekend on
the 4th
and 5th
of
March, the annual
UK Kendo University
Championships took
place in Cambridge,
where Imperial College
took home several awards,
including winning the kyu
grade team competition.
Kendo is a Japa-
nese martial art, similar to
European fencing, where
the objective in competitions
is to score points by striking
the opponent on one of
several predetermined target
areas with a shinai (bamboo
sword), which represents a
real Japanese katana. Kendo
is a relatively recent descend-
ant of earlier Japanese sword
schools, which emerged due
to a need to practice without
the danger of real or wooden
swords.
The University Champion-
ships are divided into six
categories, with four indi-
vidual events: the men and
women’s kyu for players with
less than two years’ experi-
ence; the men and women’s
open for players with more
than two years’ experience
or with a dan grade; as well
as two team events: the kyu
and open team competi-
tions, where competitors
fight in teams of five with
similar experience restric-
tions as seen in the individual
competitions.
Our competitors left
for Cambridge on Friday
evening, staying overnight
ready for an early start on
Saturday morning for the
individual competitions. On
Saturday, the championship
began simultaneously with the
men and women’s kyu grade
individual events, where a
total of sixteen of our mem-
bers competed.
In the men’s kyu category,
most of our members were
knocked out in the pool
stages, but one of our mem-
bers, Spencer Cheung, made
it to the semi-finals, winning
joint third place. In the
women’s kyu, three Imperial
players competed, with one
making it to the quarter finals.
Both the men and women’s
kyu were eventually won by
players from Cardiff Metro-
politan University.
On Saturday afternoon,
after the kyu grade events,
the men and women’s open
competitions took place. No
members from Imperial took
part in the women’s open,
and both competitors from
Imperial in the men’s open
were unfortunately eliminated
in the pool stages. These were
eventually won by players
from York and Bradford
respectively.
The championship
adjourned here for the day,
and after a short free practice
session with competitors from
other universities and senior
kendo players, our members
retired for dinner and early
rest in preparation for the
team competitions on Sunday.
On Sunday morning, the
highly anticipated kyu team
competition took place,
followed by the open team
competition. Two teams from
Imperial took part in the kyu
category: Imperial B was
knocked out by University of
Kent A in the first round, but
Imperial A decisively won
their first-round match against
York, to face the strong Den-
shinkan A team in the second
round.
Against Denshinkan, Impe-
rial A were not off to a great
start, with the first two fights
going to Denshinkan by two
points each. The third fight,
fought by Sup Song from
Imperial, needed to be won,
and Sup delivered with an
impressive win of two points.
Imperial’s Liam Yasin was in
fourth position, and won by
one point, leaving the score
at two fights each, Denshin-
kan with more points, leaving
it to the fifth fight to decide
the match.
Our fifth and final player,
Spencer Cheung, was up
against one of the strongest
players in the kyu category,
who had won the individual
event the day before. A
victory being necessary to
continue; Spencer delivered
with a decisive two-point
win against the player from
Denshinkan. Thus, Imperial A
emerged victorious against
Denshinkan A, three fights to
two.
Imperial A, with further wins
against Lancaster and the
joint Glasgow/Strathclyde
team, proceeded to the final
against the team from Oxford
University. With Oxford
winning the first and third
fights, and Imperial winning
the second and fourth, it was
again going to be decided
by the fifth fight. Spencer
won the fight crushingly by
two points, giving Imperial
A first place in the kyu teams
category for the first time in
many years.
Unfortunately, the Imperial
team competing in the open
category lost in the first round
to King’s College London,
and was knocked out of the
competition. This category
was eventually won by
Oxford University after an
exciting final between Oxford
and York, culminating in a
representative match between
the first and second place
winners of the men’s open the
previous day.
Many congratulations go
to the members of Imperial A
(Ze Rong Lum, Jaime Rodri-
guez, Byung Sup Song, Liam
Yasin and Spencer Cheung)
for winning the kyu teams
competition, and Spencer
Cheung for placing third in
the men’s kyu individuals.
Many thanks also go to our
coach, Emiko Yoshikawa, who
has spent many years coach-
ing Imperial students in the art
of Kendo, for her dedication
and support to the club.
The 2017-18 University
Championships will be hosted
by Glasgow University.
