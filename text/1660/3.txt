CodeCon finals prove (expectedly) tricky
“Firefighter Tim” posed particular difficulties
Matt Rego
that created it, Chris Benedict,
said that it even took him
a while to solve the puzzle
himself.
Aside from being just a
competition, the event has
been seen as an opportunity
for Bloomberg and other
companies to scout out
potential employees. Several
students from America took an
internship with the company’s
New York office following his
success in the competition.
The questions from CodeCon
have been used throughout
the world; more than 15,000
participants have used its
browser based e-Learning tool
to sharpen up their coding
skills.
L
ondon has been
host to amazing
competitions in recent
years. We hosted the
Olympic Games in
2012 and shows like
The X Factor and Britain’s
Got Talent have been world
renowned hits for the better
half of a decade, but last
January, London was host to a
different kind of competition,
one that it was no surprise to
see Imperial students thriving
in.
On 27 January, London’s
Bloomberg office was host
to Global CodeCon Finals
(GCCF), a two-hour long
competition between 140
of the top coders from
universities and colleges
throughout the world. Four
Imperial students were finalists
in the competition that hosted
45 different schools from all
over Europe, the U.S. and
Canada. Szilveszter Szekely,
Jacek Burys, Mihai Popa Dan
Alex and Paul Gramatovici,
proudly represented Imperial.
Bloomberg engineer,
Rangan Prabhakaran, created
the competition in 2014 with
the intention to incentivize
studentstoimprovetheircoding
abilities through competition.
Throughout the whole of last
year, competitions were held
at universities with strong
computer science programs
all over the world. The winners
of these competitions were
invited to London and New
York for the finals.
Bloomberg software
engineers created all of the
questions in the final event.
Similar to a final exam, all of
the questions were kept secret
from competitors; the different
puzzles and questions were
presented in random patterns
meant to stump competitors.
“The contest itself was
very intense, as solving the
tasks quickly was crucial.”
Said Mihai Popa, one of
the finalists from Imperial.
“When coding, you must be
confident in your thoughts, it
is a demanding activity which
requires sustained training.
At the Bloomberg CodeCon
finals, I feel that the main
difficulty was implementing
the solutions to the problems
rather discovering the actual
solutions.” He said.
Only one participant was
able to answer every one
of the questions and he was
eventually crowned winner of
the competition. One question
would ask students to arrange
antique statues by height in
as few moves as possible, the
next may ask them to write a
program to win at Pokémon
Go. According to Bloomberg’s
blog covering the event, one
question in particular, dubbed
“Firefighter Tim” gained some
notoriety for its difficulty.
It had only a two percent
success rate across the 140
finalists. The question tasked
students to write algorithms,
test optimizations, and create
different data structures to
save as many people as
possible from the burning
walls of a building, all with a
limited amount of water. The

f you walk through Beit
Quad, you’re more likely
than not to find at least
one person wearing
some sort of flashy outfit.
Imperial is not known for
any sort of fashion programs
but students still love to flex
their personal styles, whether
it’s the preppy jocks from the
Rugby team or flannel clad
hipsters from the art clubs.
London’s fashion week has
come and gone but that has not
stopped streetwear fanatics
from throughout the world
from continuously shopping
throughout the SOHO area.
Supreme, a skateboard and
streetwearcompanybasedout
of New York has been making
waves in the high fashion
industry with a collaborative
collection with Louis Vuitton
from Paris’ fashion week last
month. Supreme’s store in
London had a massive queue
of over 150 guests, cloaked
in popular brands like Palace,
Tommy Hilfiger, Thrasher, and
of course Supreme. All of who
hoped to get their hands on
their latest drop of clothing.
Every Thursday morning,
Supreme releases new clothes
in stores throughout the world
and on-line. Though the drops
are frequent, supplies are
limited so once the stock sells
out, there is no more supply,
causing a high demand for
all things Supreme and prices
to skyrocket on the resale
market.
The queue formed several
blocksawayfromthestoreand
wrapped around the block in
an alley plagued by violent
gusts of wind. No items from
the Louis Vuitton collaboration
were on sale, but that didn’t
stop shoppers from buying
most of the inventory stock
in the store and on sale. By
14:00 almost every top and
hat that Supreme had debuted
that day had sold out online
according to their website.
Tim Collins, a teenager from
Blackwater, was at the front
of the queue and had gotten
there at 7:00, four hours
before doors opened. It was
his first time buying Supreme
the day it came out at the
store. “Every other time I’ve
bought clothes, I just got them
online or from my mates.” He
said.
Another teenager that was
skipping school for the drop
was named Vova, a 14 year

way from Russia.
The guests were not just
teenagers though; a 25 year
old from Brunswick said that
this was his seventh time
waiting in the queue. “I never
buy online. I always come
here for my clothes.” He said.
The next day, Palace
Skateboards released their
line of items for the Spring
and Summer seasons; massive
crowds lined up outside the
London based streetwear
company’s shop in SOHO
for their one and only
drop.
QS World Rankings by subject released
Gender equality comes to the forefront
Lef Apostolakis
global academic rankings.
Cambridge still reigns
supreme. It ranks in the top
ten for more subjects than any
other institution in the world
(36) and UK unis take just
over one-third of all top-three
positions, and over a quarter
of all top ten positions.
QS Head of Research, Ben
Sowter, said: “If last autumn’s
overall rankings suggested
the winds of winter blowing
towards the UK’s higher
education system, this year’s
subject rankings – enabling
observers to drill down into
university performance more
deeply – provide a less chilling
forecast. Though the UK does
see its share of overall places
decrease, this is a trend
observed by institutions in the
US, Canada, and Australia,
as other nations grow
increasingly competitive.
We observe nations in
both Eastern Europe and
Asia – most notably Russia
and China – increasing their
overall share. However, the
upper echelons of the tables
remain dominated by the US
and UK, and this seems likely
to continue for the foreseeable
future.”
T
he QS university
rankings have
just released a
breakdown of
ranking by subject
and while UK
universities remain global
leaders in higher education it
would appear that competition
keeps getting more intense
each year.
The latest instalment of the
rankings takes into account
46 different Subjects and five
composite Subject Areas.
Initial results show the UK
taking the lead in eight
subjects, including Anatomy
and Physiology, Archaeology,
Development Studies,
Education, English Language
and Literature, Geography,
and Sports Related Subjects.
Imperial landed on ninth
place this year and was
overtaken by three UK
institutions, with UCL taking
seventh place, the University
of Oxford taking sixth
place and the University
of Cambridge, the highest
scoring UK university landing
on fourth place.
In Engineering and
Technology related subjects,
So at least we’ve got that
going for us.
Out of the Engineering
and Tech subjects that were
evaluated, Imperial’s strongest
was Civil and Structural
Engineering coming fourth
globally just after Cambridge,
while it scored lowest in
Computer Science related
subjects which placed twelfth.
However all Engineering and
Tech degrees still managed to
bag a top ten spot.
Out of the Life Sciences and
Medical Subjects that were
evaluated, Imperial’s most
internationally competitive
degrees were its Medical
degrees,in12th
place,followed
by Biological Science degrees
in 19th
place and finally by
Pharmacology degrees in 26th
place. Imperial fell behind
Cambridge and Oxford in all
three categories but scored
higher in Biological Science
degrees than UCL.
Finally out of its
Natural Science degrees,
Environmental Sciences
scored the highest coming in
ninth while Earth and Marine
Science degrees scored the
lowest landing on 26th
place.
No other Natural Science
degrees got in the top ten.
This meta-analysis is an
addition to the rankings which
were originally released
earlier in September 2016.
The rankings saw Imperial fall
to ninth place, from eighth in
2015 and joint second with
Cambridge in 2014, scoring
94.1 overall. Imperial’s
ranking reflects its decreasing
overall score which has fallen
which is weighed 20% and
aims to identify the universities
that are best equipped to
provide small class sizes and
a good level of individual
supervision. International
faculty ratio and international
student ratio are both weighed
at 5% and aim to assess how
attractive an institution is to
foreign students and lecturers.
And finally citations per
faculty which are weighed
20% and aim at assessing an
institution’s research impact.
QS uses Scopus, “the world’s
largest database of research
abstracts and citations”. It
takes into consideration the
five most recent complete
years of data and assesses the
total citation count in relation
to the number of academic
faculty members.
Although Imperial achieved
a perfect or near perfect
scores (100) in almost every
metric this academic year, it
landed on a 69.8 in citations
per faculty, which marks a
four year low.
Despite the minor move
down the league table,
Imperial remains a leader
in STEM, while UK and US
institutions still dominate the
