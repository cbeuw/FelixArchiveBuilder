follows in a close second

at a departmental breakdown
though, the Department of
Undergraduate Medicine
is in the lead (54.6%). This
may or may not be a direct
result of a potential medic

medic candidates contesting
the six sabbatical positions
(excluding the ICSMU
President). Consequently there
is a strong possibility that next

that have impacted her time
at College, stating “I’ve never
felt short of inspiration here”.
The evening ended with
a performance from the
Imperielles, the all-female
A Cappella group, who
continue to show just how
broadly talented the women
at Imperial are.
The display boards for
the Women@Imperial
Exhibition are in the College
Main Entrance and feature
photographs of female staff
as well as some of College’s
policies relating to improving
gender equality. A selection of
the photography can also be
found on the College website.
T
uesday evening saw
the launch event
of the Women@
Imperial Week
in the College
Main Entrance.
Women@Imperial Week is
an annual celebration of the
achievements of past and
present female staff and
students at Imperial.
The event started with
a panel discussion titled
“Gender Equality: Ongoing
Challenges Struggles,
Strategies and (Some)
Secrets of Success: how can
women get to the top?” which
featured representatives from
Imperial Business Partners.
One attendee described it as
“absolutely one of the best
panel discussions I’ve ever
been to”.
The evening also included
speeches from James Stirling,
Provost of Imperial College
London, Professor Dorothy
Griffiths, Provost’s Envoy for
Gender Equality and Rachel
Blythe, ICU Deputy President
(Finance & Services).
The speeches captured the
feel of the current landscape
for gender equality, showing
particular self-awareness
of the issues Imperial has
to overcome following the
review into Imperial College’s
institutional culture and its
impact on gender equality.
From James Stirling spoke

has seen a record breaking
number of tweets using the
hashtag #imperialwomen.
Imperial is very nearly at the
10,000 women mark (both
staff and students) and whilst
there are clearly challenges
facing the women here, the
representation is definitely
something to celebrate.
Professor Dot Griffiths
continues to be an incredible
force for gender equality
at Imperial College and
talked about the Women at
Imperial event as well as her
own experiences. During her
speech she introduced the
launch of Women At Imperial
College: Past, Present and
Future, written by Anne
Barrett, College Archivist &
Corporate Records Manager.
The book contains an ‘amazing
record of history’ detailing
the role women have played
in College since its inception
and providing a guide to their
achievements. In the words of
Professor Griffiths “You just
have to look at the book to see
what you can do”.
The real star of the speeches
was Rachel Blythe, who
discussed her own experiences
growing up in the middle
east and the inherent sexism
she faced. Blythe also spoke
about the women at Imperial
T
hank God it’s Friday.
Voting for the
Leadership elections
ends at noon
today, as does the
constant online and
offline harassment from your
potential future leaders!
At the time of writing there’s
been a 34.28% turnout which
translates into 6,246 students
out of Imperial’s ca 16,000
students bothering to vote,
amounting to a staggering
171,003 votes cast. Last year
saw a 45.47% turnout which
placed Imperial College at the
top of the national democracy
leaderboard. This year there
seems to be a lower turnout
in comparison to the last two
years. As of yet we’ve officially
fallen behind 2015’s numbers
(there’s no point even talking
about a comparison with
2016’s turnout which we’ve
been behind since day one).
Though there is a possibility
that Friday’s last minute voting
spike will see turnout reaching
or even surpassing 2016
and 2015 voter turnout, it is
unlikely. Though marketing
of the elections might be to
blame in part, it is certainly
also a result of the pool of
candidates. There are only
thirteen ‘real’ candidates
and competition is much less
intense this year, meaning
campaigning on campus
has similarly chilled out in
comparison to previous years.
Looking at Faculty
participation, we can see the
Faculty of Engineering being
so far the most involved, with
2,898 out of 7,509 students
(38.6%) having voted already.
The Faculty of Natural Science
year, half of the sabbatical
officers will be medics. The
least involved Department is
INSPIRE, a teacher teaching
programme, which no one
has ever heard about but is
apparently a thing. None
of the 18 INSPIRE students
have voted so far. SHAME.
SHAME. SHAME.

ecent years show
an alarming trend
amongst students.
Rising rates of
mental illness
show little sign of
slowing. In the past ten years,
suicide rates have almost
doubled. In York, up to 50%
of ambulance call-outs to the
university were for self-harm
or suicide attempts. This is a
far from localised issue‒ it’s an
epidemic.
Some of the reasons
behind the skyrocketing levels
of depression and anxiety
(reported in the Independent
as a 70% increase over
the past 25 years) seem so
obvious it’s almost surprising
they make the headlines.
The latest culprits are tuition
fees and an ever-increasing
cost of living (as all of us in
London can attest to). What
is worrying is the number of
students that cannot afford to
pay rent (over a quarter) or
even eat (39%) because of
their lack of financial support.
And while technically tuition
fees shouldn’t be a problem
while still at university (due
to the availability of student
loans) that doesn’t stop any
of us worrying about our
accumulating debt..
Other common factors are
all too familiar. Stress, alcohol,
a poor diet, and a lack of sleep
and exercise have all been
cited as contributors to poor
Higher Education faces depression epidemic
Joanna Wormald discusses the rise of mental illness across UK universities and efforts (or lack of)
that have been made to tackle student depression.
mental health. Frustratingly,
reports rarely seem to mention
how difficult it is to escape
these patterns when you have
a mental illness. It’s hard to go
to the gym and eat healthily
when you barely have the
energy to drag yourself into
lectures each day (hardly a
unique experience for students
and perhaps one reason it
can be so tricky to recognise
depression). And sleep doesn’t
come easily when you’ve
spent all night worrying about
your next assignment.
A recent review into the
culture at Imperial revealed
a particularly adverse
environment when it comes to
fostering good mental health.
Researchers created a word
cloud describing the culture
at Imperial using responses
from surveyed participants.
Although there were 246
positive descriptors, 186
were negative, and a further
213 deemed ambiguous.
Highlightsinclude:“cut-throat”,
“abusive”, “authoritarian”,
and “homogeneous” (in case
you’d forgotten that we’re
all scientists). Furthermore,
the pressure to live up to
Imperial’s reputation for
excellence leaves many
students feeling alienated and
in constant competition with
their peers. None of this is
exactly conducive to a happy
student population. So what
can be done about it?
Students can receive
individual support from the
College’s Student Mental
Health Advisers (SMHA)
but only if referred by a staff
member. This risks leaving
many students without help
since those with mental
health issues can find it
difficult to reach out to others
and members of staff may
never even realise that a
student is struggling. Those
with a referral must wait
until a suitable appointment
becomes available. The
Imperial website gives no
indication of how long this
takes on average and at time
of writing, the mental health
service has not responded to
our requests for comment. If
other universities are anything
to go by, it doesn’t look good.
Many students have to wait
weeks before receiving an
appointment, during which
time their condition can rapidly
deteriorate with dangerous
effects.
If face-to-face counselling
isn’t an option, there’s the
possibility of doing it over
email. This pilot scheme was
launched at the start of the
current academic year and
allows students to self-refer
(although you do have to
fill in a registration form
and questionnaire to check
your suitability). If accepted,
students are initially offered
four email exchanges with a
counsellor (with the possibility
of adding an extra four
sessions if necessary). The
service is aimed at students
who spend most of their time
off-campus (e.g. on work
placements) but could be a
real help for those who have
difficulties vocalising their
emotions.
Of course there are some
downsides. Confidentiality
problems are solved fairly
easily by handling emails
in private. A trickier issue
however is that emails can’t
convey physical and verbal
cues so miscommunication
has the potential of becoming
a real issue. Additionally,
only being able to send
one email per appointment
makes it harder to maintain a
continuous dialogue.
Tackling the mental health
crisis isn’t just a matter of hiring
more professionals (although
better student to staff ratios
would certainly help). Sir
Anthony Seldon, Vice-
Chancellor at the University
of Buckingham and a vocal
commentator on student
mental health, recommends
a “collegiate atmosphere”
and “sense of community”
within universities things
Imperial has been criticised
as lacking but could easily
rectify by providing more
communal spaces. Finally, we
need to challenge the stigma
around mental illness. Our
male-dominated culture of
excellence may make students
even less likely to admit to
needing help. We shouldn’t let
students in need slip through
the cracks.
The College’s 2015-
2020 strategy promises to
“be mindful of the need to
promote good mental health”
and “prioritise the mental well-
being of the student body”.
Whether this will be effective
remains to be seen.
