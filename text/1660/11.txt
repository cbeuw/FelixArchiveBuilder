allet Black’s
triple bill at the
Barbican consisted
of three works,
which covered an
eclectic range of
compositions and dances. The
first work, House of Dreams,
was a non-narrative work
consisting of three pas de
deux and a finale to a diverse
selection of compositions by
Debussy. The compositions
were not entirely disparate:
all were solo compositions for
piano, producing a minimalist
atmosphere which was
matched by the sparsity of
props on stage and the simple
lighting used throughout.
Each piece conveyed a
distinct emotional tone – the
work opened with the melodic
and whimsical Prelude from
the Suite Bergamasque but
proceeded to the haunting
and introspective Des
Pas Sur La Neige before
finishing with the frantic and
bold Passepied. However
abrupt, these transitions
were not jarring as they
were confidently handled
by the dancing pairs: in
particular the partnership
of Sayaka Ichikawa and
Damien Johnson stood out as
terrifically coordinated and
emotive.
The second work of the first
half was called Captured
and was based on the seven
movements in Shostakovich’s
String Quartet No.11 in F
minor. Originally performed
in 2012, the work sees two
pairs of dancers move back
and forward across the stage
in a territorial fight. Despite
the orchestral accompani-
ment the style and lighting
remained deliberately min-
imal. I particularly admired
the costumes of the male
dancers, who were dressed
like farm labourers with a
tucked in shirt and rolled up
trouser legs. This prompted
my imagination to question
what type of story chore-
ographer Martin Lawrance
was hoping to tell, whilst the
minimal setting left things
ambiguous enough to let my
own narrative take hold.
The final work, Red Riding
Hood was a funny, bold, and
at times salacious portrayal
of the classic fairy tale.
Choreographed by Annabelle
Lopez Ochoa as a coming of
age story, it sees a young girl
break from her parent’s rules
to discover her own sexuality
and personality. For this,
Ochoa explored the symbol-
ism within the classic fairy-tale
and crafted her own narrative
from it, knitting together a
well-balanced selection of
nostalgic pieces by French
composers such as Rene Aub-
ry’s Monday and Armand
Amar’s Le Petit Loup. The final
result is thoroughly enter-
taining and both leads, Cira
Robinson and Mthuthuzeli
November, were well suited
to their light hearted roles.
The lack of live musical
performance was the only
major flaw in this otherwise
expansive production. One of
the advantages of having a
live orchestra is that it allows
‘feedback’ between the
orchestra and the dancers.
The conductor’s eye level
will normally correspond
with the stage floor so the
musicians are able to respond
dynamically to the perform-
ers movements, for example
by extending a crescendo
depending on the number of
pirouettes a dancer manages.
Without an orchestra individ-
ual performances become far
more static and the choreog-
raphy at times felt robotic and
artificial. There were a few
instances of this throughout
the night, but for the most part
the narratives were immersive
enough that the pre-recorded
music wasn’t an issue.
Ballet Black was founded in
2001 by Cassa Pancho, an
alumnus of classical ballet at
the Royal Academy. Shocked
by the lack of non-white
students and performers of
ballet Pancho established the
company with the aim of pro-
viding dancers of black and
Asian descent opportunities in
classical ballet. Sixteen years
later this aim is still clear: “It’s
all about the D word: Diver-
sity” Pancho writes in the
programme’s welcome letter.
The idea being that diversity
on stage will produce diver-
sity at local ballet schools,
which are the foundation
of the “classical ballet food
chain”. This will have numer-
ous consequences, on stage

and off: for one thing filling
ballet recitals with non-white
audiences. This was the case
in the Barbican which, for a
ballet performance, would
have been unprecedented
twenty years ago.
Pancho’s goal is gradually
being realised: in August
2015 Misty Copeland
became the principal ballet
dancer at the American Ballet
Theatre. Copeland – who
as a young girl in working
class Los Angeles was able
to strike a partnership with
the renowned instructor
Cindy Bradley – is the first
black woman to achieve this
distinction in the theatre’s 75
year old history. Similar suc-
cesses are occurring across
the Atlantic: one dancer of
immense renown is Yuhui
Choe, a Japanese dancer
with Korean parentage who
is a soloist in the Royal Ballet
in London; this position is also
held by Eric Underwood,
a talented black American
dancer who discovered ballet
at the relatively late age of
14.
There is still a lot of work to
be done, as the historic asso-
ciations of ballet in Russia,
Italy, and France mean it
remains a disproportion-
ately white enterprise. This is
exemplified by the difficulty
faced by non-white perform-
ers in getting ballet shoes
that match their skin tone:
ballet shoes are traditionally
manufactured in pink or
beige tones, and until recently
there were no ballet shoes
for non-white feet. Instead
black dancers had to cake
their shoes in makeup before
a performance. Following a
request made on Instagram
by Underwood, the manufac-
turer Bloch has now created
a line of darker colours. Not
all were so understanding of
Underwood’s predicament:
one Russian ballet company
even responded “You are
black, you should wear black
ballet shoes”.
Whatever it lacks in tech-
nical finesse Ballet Black
compensates for in bravado
and panache, it is a thor-
oughly enjoyable spectacle
that is bringing ballet to a
diverse audience and is enjoy-
able regardless of your past
exposure to ballet.
