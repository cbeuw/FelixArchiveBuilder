CANCER
VIRGO
This week you
discover the clitoris.
LEO
PISCES
AQUARIUS
SAGITTARIUS
SCORPIO
LIBRA
GEMINI
TAURUS
ARIES
This week someone
calls you an ugly cunt.
It’s Mr ugly cunt you
filth.
This week you realise
you’re allergic to
cucumbers. That’s what
you get for playing
without a condom.
This week you’re
disappointed when
security don’t do pat
downs at Varsity. You
were rather hoping to
get to second base.
This week you get
offered a PhD at
Imperial but decide
life’s worth more
than that, flip your
supervisor off and take
off for a two year trip
around the world. Fuck
you science.
This week you think
you see a dick on the
front cover but you
don’t say anything in
front of your friends in
case you’re wrong. But
you’re right. There is a
dick on the front cover.
And it’s smiling.
This week you wake up
after having the same
recurring dream about
going on a family vacation
to Mordor. Also you have
crabs. Weird.
This week you
get elected Union
president even though
you didn’t even bother
putting up a picture or
a manifesto. Your sexy
sexy name did all the
work for you.
This week you take a
day off and dedicate
it to self-care. You try
all the masturbation
techniques felix
suggests and break
your genitals. But it
was so worth it.
This week you end up
in the west basement
in your attempt to
find Metric. You
come across a pale,
emaciated, hollow-
eyed figure. For a
moment you think it’s
the grim reaper, but it’s
just the felix editor.
This week you hire
a Barclays Bike to get
home after a night out
at fabric. I mean Lance
Armstrong won seven Tour
de France’s on drugs, how
hard can it be?
This week you find
your virginity. It had
fallen behind your
living room sofa. You
have mixed feelings
‘cause on one hand
you had no idea where
you lost it, on the other
hand you’re a virgin
again.
CAPRICORN
CRISIS
Chris
Dear Chris,
I’m writing to you because I constantly feel drained. Physi-
cally and emotionally, and probably also economically.
When I come back from uni, even after my Ecology and
Conservation lectures which I love, all I want to do is scream
into a pillow.
When I come back from the soup kitchen where I volunteer,
all I want to do is sleep, sometimes for ever.
Even after a good RAG sesh, no matter how much money
I’ve raised, when I go home, I just sit in front of the TV and
watch East Enders.
What is up? Like for real? I haven’t had the energy to play
Lacrosse in months.
Best,
JJ, Biology
Dear JJ,
Let’s for a moment assume you don’t suffer
from crippling depression. You’re just spread-
ing yourself too thin gurl! Let’s start with your
love for Ecology and Conservation. Like have
you not noticed we’re going through the sixth
or seventh mass extinction or something? By
the time you graduate there won’t be anything
to conserve! Just go into big Pharma and dis-
cover the next Viagra or something!
Also what’s up with the soup kitchen and the
charity work? You know who needs charity?
Me! I’ve been giving advice to strangers out
of the goodness of my heart for two terms now
and what thanks have I received? Nothing!
Nada! Zilch! Next time you go out with a
RAG bucket, take it home and empty all the
contents into a bathtub and take an extremely
uncomfortable but hugely satisfying money
HOROSCOPES
bath. Or just set fire to it and watch it burn.
Who cares! You’ve earned it and also charity
is so 20th
century.
And can we take a moment to address your
Lacrosse habit? Like let’s be real, do you even
enjoy playing Lacrosse? Does anyone? It’s like
handball but with hockey sticks. Just go to the
drinking socials to numb the existential pain.
My mama said, there’s nothing drinking can’t
solve. Allegedly. She left us when I was five –
ran away with her AA coach.
There’s no ‘us’ in me JJ. So just live your life for
you and fuck everything else ‘cause at the end
of the day, you’re the one stuck with the bill.
Big luv,
Chris xxxx
