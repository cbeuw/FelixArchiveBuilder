internal energy and endless
empathy.
Certain Woman, based
off a number of short stories
by Maile Meloy, acts as an
exploration of loneliness
and isolation. The women
at its centre are tangentially
related to each other, but
never really meet; they are
trapped within their own
worlds. Laura Dern is a
lawyer dealing with a difficult
client, who refuses to listen to
her advice about a personal
injury claim. Dern plays her
character with great depth,
each subtle movement reveal-
ing the frustrations of not
being heard on account of
her gender. “It’d be so lovely
to think that if I were a man
and I could explain a law
matter, which is handled
with delicacy and grace. The
crushing weight of isolation
is borne with a lightness of
touch; her characters have a
sense of tragedy surrounding
them, but they themselves are
never viewed as tragic – they
are the heroes of their own
stories.
To me, the closest compar-
ison to Reichardt’s work is
not to be found in other films,
but rather in the work of
Edward Hopper, that Ameri-
can painter who masterfully
conveyed the experience
of being isolated amongst
others. Certain Women is like
Hopper’s canvases, acting as
a postcard from the edge of
solitude. Both Reichardt and
Hopper act, in the words of
Olivia Laing, ‘as if loneliness
was something worth looking
at’ – and this is an act of high-
lighting, of thrusting forward
into the spotlight, that takes
supreme artistic courage.
Certain Women is allowed
to unfold at its own steady
pace – Reichardt never
attempts to rush forward the
action, but instead lets the
narrative reveal itself organ-
ically. She is not interested
in large dramas, or epic
climaxes, but lets her camera
linger on the minutiae of
everyday life; what could be
more authentic than a lived
reality? Reichardt shows us
that everyone has their own
story, and everyone is worth
listening to. Certain Women
is affirming in the truest sense
of the word – by exalting
and elevating the individual
human experience, Reichardt
has created a film with
empathy, grace, and deep
humanity.

Kelly Reichardt fashions a
beautifully-intimate portrait of
four women, in her sixth feature
film, Certain Women, which
details our relationships with the
natural world, other individuals,
and our own loneliness
\\ Reichardt’s films
centre around
the normal day-
to-day lives of
average Americans,
portraying their
struggles, their
defeats, and their
small triumphs with
a relentless internal
energy and endless
empathy \\
people would listen and say
‘Okay.’,” Laura reports to a
friend, “Oh, that would be so
restful.”
Like Laura, Gina (Michelle
Williams – in her third outing
with Reichardt) is used to not
being listened to; she’s trying
to build a house with her hus-
band, but is undermined by
her daughter, and ignored by
the elderly man she’s trying to
get sandstone from. From the
first scene we see with Gina
– she’s dressed from head to
toe in running gear, lighting
up a cigarette – we know that
she’s a bundle of contradic-
tions, contorting herself to the
different roles society gets us
to play. Williams does a great
job portraying the impossible
dilemma she finds herself
in: one that asks her to act
friendly, but then chastises her
for acting at all.
In the most haunting
segment of the film, Kristen
Stewart plays Beth, a trainee
lawyer who has agreed to
teach class law in the middle
of nowhere after panick-
ing that she wouldn’t be
employed following gradua-
tion. Her class is attended by
lonely ranch-hand Jamie (Lily
Gladstone), who accompa-
nies her to a diner after every
class, before Beth makes the
4-hour drive back to Living-
ston; two individuals, united in
their loneliness, but separated
from each other by a distance
too great to traverse, Beth
and Jamie circle around each
other, trying but failing to
speak across the gaps.
The separate tales in
Certain Women weave
around one another, creating
a narrative structure that
appears loose, but belies an
internal rigor and structure.
Reichardt’s gift with dialogue
shines through; the lines
spoken by the characters,
unlike in many films, seem
completely naturalistic, with
Reichardt expertly capturing
the nuances and rhythms pres-
ent in the conversation.
Like the progenitors of
the mumblecore movement,
Reichardt focuses on dialogue
over visuals; but unlike
Andrew Bujalski and Lynn
Shelton, Reichardt’s work is
never anything less than com-
pletely focused on its subject

at the heart of Reichardt’s tale \\ Park Circus

from the edge

C
ertain Women,
American
director Kelly
Reichardt’s sixth
film, begins with
a shot that serves
as a statement of intent: a
rusting old train slowly drags
itself across the Montana
landscape, framed by snowy
mountain peaks; stoic in its
solitude, it chuffs and puffs
along the track, determined
to reach its destination,
piercing the early morning
air with sharp whistles,
announcing its presence. It’s
a fitting representation of
Reichardt’s films, which centre
around the normal day-to-day
lives of average Americans,
portraying their struggles,
their defeats, and their small
triumphs with a relentless
