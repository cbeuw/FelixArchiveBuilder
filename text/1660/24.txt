IC Gospel Choir make it to UGCY Finals
Daniel Ogbonna
T
he Imperial College
Gospel Choir
(ICGC) family
cordially invite
you to come and
support us in our
attempt to make ICGC history
by placing top three in the
University Gospel Choir of the
Year (UGCY) finals.
ICGC is a non-auditioned,
relaxed choir and we pride
ourselves in our ability to
bring together people from
a variety of backgrounds
and skill levels based on a
common love for singing.
Our membership is open to
all regardless of religious
affiliation or singing experi-
ence. We also provide the
opportunity for those curious
about the Christian faith to
find people to direct their
questions to in a laid back
atmosphere. We ensure
that all members are well
integrated and feel at home
when we are together –
whether we are singing at the
top of our voices or stuffing
our faces with food at one of
our club socials.
The University Gospel Choir
of the Year (UGCY) is like
the World Cup for University
gospel choirs and we have
made the finals on 4 occa-
sions – 2011, 2012, 2013 and
2015. However, in our four
previous attempts, we have
not managed to place in the
top three. This year we have
made it to the finals again
under very stiff competition
with many universities form-
ing gospel choirs in recent
years. This is testament to the
progression of our choir over
the years and it is our hope
that this year, with all the
momentum we have gathered
recently, we will be able to
place in the top three.
Last year, we celebrated our
10th
anniversary with ICGC’s
biggest concert till date – wel-
coming over 100 spectators
to St Paul’s Hammersmith.
This was a turning point in
the history of the club, a
clear sign of ICGC’s growth
and development as a choir
and also as a family. The
faces of ICGC continuously
change but the vision has
stayed constant – continu-
ously infusing our passion for
singing with our passion for
sharing the gospel message.
This vision has been the main
driving force for the ongoing
improvement in the quality of
our performances.
Our activities include regu-
lar performances at a variety
of events such as: Supperclub
(a dinner held for homeless
people), Ideal homeshow, at
churches, and at events put
on by Imperial societies. We
host our annual Christmas
and Easter concerts with our
Easter concert coming up on
the 14th
of March, (6:30p.m.
at St Alban’s, Fulham, W6
8H)
The details for UGCY are:
18th
March, 6:30pm, The Hip-
podrome, North End Road,
Golders Green NW11 7RP.

The 2017 IC Cinema Spring All-Nighter
Sophie Sagawe
T
his year’s Spring
All-Nighter will take
place on Tuesday
the 21st
of March
at 6pm, ending
at approximately
7.45am the next day. For
those who are inexplicably out
of the loop with this beloved
Imperial College tradition: it’s
a whole night of films, shown
back to back, on a screen 8
meters wide, for a tenner. Oh,
you want unlimited hot-dogs
too? We got you.
18:00 The Lego Batman
Movie
“I’m Batman.” If you liked
The Lego Movie, you’ll love
The Lego Batman Movie.
Because it has more Batman
in it. Lego is great and
Batman is great. Batman.
20:20 Hidden Figures
You think being a girl at
Imperial is hard? Try being
a woman in the sixties. And
black. In America. At a
male-dominated tech com-
pany. Hidden Figures is the
true story of three women, all
brilliant mathematicians, who
made significant contributions
to the NASA missions that put
people into space, but had to
fight tooth and nail to get the
recognition they deserved.
Equal parts frustrating and
uplifting, it’s a film that
reminds us how far we’ve
come – and how far we still
have to go.
23:05 T2 Trainspotting
Choose Life. Choose
Imperial Cinema. Choose
the All-Nighter. Because
it’ll include the much-an-
ticipated sequel to the 90s
cult classic based on Irvine
Welsh’s novel. Can you think
of a better way to spend two
hours than in the company
of a bunch of potty-mouthed,
backstabbing, violent, (ex-)
drug addicts with a lot of his-
tory to sort out? Ah cannae.
01:15 Moonlight
Barry Jenkins’ Best Pic-
ture-winning film is the story
of Chiron, who grows up on
a housing estate surrounded
by poverty and violence. The
story is told in a triptych of
life-defining events from the
perspective of child, adoles-
cent, and young man, each
portrayed by different actors.
It’s full of sadness but simulta-
neously deeply moving in its
exploration of themes such as
identity and love. Expect this
to become a modern classic!
03:20 Fences
Adapted from the
award-winning play by
August Wilson for the screen,
and starring none other than
Denzel Washington and the
ever-fabulous, now Acad-
emy-Award-winning Viola
Davies. Washington plays a
man whose dreams of a base-
ball career were thwarted
by the American Leagues
not accepting black players
in the 1940s – a complex of
bitterness and regret that eats
away at his relationship to
his wife and his son, until he
reaches a breaking point.
05:50 Sing
A star-studded (although
you can’t see it, because
animation, duh) feel-good
film about a koala bear who
puts on a singing competition
to save his theatre, and finds
his hands full of crazy and
crazily talented contest-
ants! Listen out for voices of
A-listers such as Matthew
McConaughey and Scarlett
Johansson.
The All-Nighter takes place
in the Union Concert Hall, 2nd
floor of the Union Building,
Beit Quad. Tickets are £10
online (until 4pm on the day)
and £12 on the door. If you
don’t fancy staying all night,
tickets for individual films can
be purchased at £3 each on
the door. An additional £5
buys you all-night, all-you-
can-eat hot food and drinks.
