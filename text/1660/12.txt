his is a show about
relationships in
every sense of the
word, though as its
name may imply,
the focus here is
one of those casual, one-off
encounters that many people
are engaged with in this day
and age. This idea is explored
with a very simple premise;
a woman, in the wake of her
divorce, moves herself and
her daughter to her brother’s
home.
The three main characters
all have their quirks and inner
demons they’re trying to fight.
Valerie, the mother, is fresh
out of a divorce and trying to
get back into the dating scene
and get some action. Alex,
her brother, has a self-made
fortune thanks to his dating
site, but personally struggles
to find a meaningful relation-
ship, instead taking part in
a series of one-night stands.
Finally, we have Laura, the
teen daughter, who deals with
being a teenager in an age
of social media panics and
sexting, as well as an initial
crush on her teacher.
This is the kind of show that’s
better to binge-watch than
watch in weekly instalments.
The short format and solid
performances hook you in
straight away. Later, the char-
acters are developed further
and become more nuanced,
leaving you more engrossed
and intrigued by what’s in
store. When you hear about
their childhoods and learn
how damaged they all are,
it explains much about their
present behaviour.
For example, Alex initially
comes off as a bit of a tool
who sleeps around with
multiple women. However, as
he matures and tries to get
into a long-term relationship
of his own, his scenes end
up becoming the most com-
pelling material of the show.
There’s an interesting role
reversal between him and his
sister; at the start, Val seems
like the responsible one and
Alex the selfish narcissist, but
he starts to understand and
even anticipate the conse-
quences of his actions, while
she goes and has sex with her
brother’s girlfriend.
As far as young teenage
characters go, Laura is a
refreshing change of pace
from the norm. She’s fairly
comfortable in who she is
and not ashamed of what she
wants in a relationship. Her
relationship with her mother
is open and frequently
poignant. The two of them
are more like friends who
discuss the intimate details
of their lives rather than a
distant mother and daughter.
Interestingly, things between
them become a little shaky
when Val tries to be a more
responsible mother at times.
The three characters form
an odd, dysfunctional family
unit, whose level of appropri-
ateness is called on several
times. They’re able to vaguely
function as human beings
when they work together but
on a codependent, self-de-
structive level that makes the
possibility of broadening
their circle beyond the three
of them almost impossible.
While none of them are per-
fect and perform not-so-great
acts, the show is able to make
you empathize with the main
characters even as it refuses
to forgive them for their
worst. The acting goes a long
way in making you under-
stand the characters.

Val seems the sanest of the
bunch but her actions are the
most destructive. Through
her expressions and scenes
you can see how and why
she chooses to go down the
wrong path.
In the middle of all the
character drama, some
interesting ideas are tossed
around and considered. If the
internet has made it easier to
find the right people for our
personal or social needs, then

why do we still form bonds
with people who disappoint
us? Why do we adhere to
the same social structures
for so long when there are
other options we could try?
It’s when the show starts to
tap into these questions and
issues that it becomes more
special and intriguing. Some
relationships hold themselves
together out of inertia, but as
the show might suggest, some
run more deeply than we can
understand.
Even though the show
may be touted as a comedy,
it’s more half-hour drama
than funny, though its sharp
observations and moments
more than make up for it.
It has a very indie feel with
strong performances and
writing throughout. If
you’re up for a fun,
introspective look
on relationships
and one-offs,
this is a show
to watch.
