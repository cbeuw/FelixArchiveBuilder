Kombucha Kraft
felix boldly uses the lab experience
acquired at this noble institution to
probe the depths of SCOBYs, tea
and Kombucha. Is it the elixir we’ve
all been looking for, or just a another
fad? More importantly, will it be
drinkable at the end of it all? Place
your bets, and read on.
I
try to be healthy.
Sometimes. You see,
when you have to sustain
a food blog full of cakes
and ice creams and
burgers and doughnuts,
you have to find a way to
balance it out. And luckily for
me, the healthy food world
is not limited to chomping
my way through an iceberg
lettuce for dinner while
balancing on a yoga mat
(which recently transformed
into a neglected, pink rolled-
up piece of plastic gathering
dust in the corner). So far, I’ve
tried most of the #eatclean
superfoods suggested by the
lovely vegans on Instagram,
including chia seed puddings,
quinoa and kale.
But I simply wasn’t liking
them, from my mind, my body
to my soul. My mouth hated
the blandness and slimy tex-
ture of the chia seeds. Quinoa
was getting a tad steep for
my wallet, and I couldn’t be
bothered to look after it on
the stove to get that “fluffy”
texture without burning the
bottom. Kale gave me hor-
rible indigestion (Ok, fine, I
was trying to demolish 1 kg of
kale in a day before its expiry
date).
After all those clean eating
failures, I got hooked up to
my next new fad: kombucha.
Kombucha is apparently
known as the “immortal
health elixir” by the Chinese
and has been around for
over 2000 years. (Weird. I’m
Chinese and I’ve never heard
of it in the last 20 years until
2 months ago on some food
blog.) It’s basically a fer-
mented, sweetened, tea drink
produced using a SCOBY.
And SCOBY stands for “sym-
biotic colony of bacteria and
yeast”. The SCOBY is mainly
formed from Saccharomy-
ces, a probiotic fungus, and
Gluconacetobacter xylinus,
the bacteria. It claims to have
amazing health benefits, such
as treating AIDS, cancer, dia-
betes, all the way to boosting
the libido (Oh yeah). In the
mouth, it tastes sweet with
noticeable acidity and a bit
of fizz.
Despite being another one
of those new health fads,
they come in an approach-
able price tag and actually
cheaper than your daily Star-
bucks. Hmm, perhaps it’s a
good idea to start swapping
your Coke or iced tea to this
exciting concoction. I also did
a bit of Googling and found
that you can actually grow
your own kombucha SCOBY
from a shop-bought bottle.
And from that SCOBY comes
a lifetime of kombucha (you’ll
see how it works in a sec).
So, with my natural
cheapo identity, thumping
curiosity and that love for
experimentation, I gave in
and bought a bottle of raw,
unfiltered, unpasteurized,
original-flavour kombucha
from Wholefoods. I poured
myself a glass – it tasted like
diluted vinegar. I carefully
closed the bottle.
Lab coat. Check. Goggles.
Check. Hair. Check. Risk
assessment. Check. Let the
brewing begin.
The first step of creating
this self-sufficient supply of
kombucha is growing the
SCOBY. The bacteria and
yeast in the SCOBY survives
on the minerals, nitrates and
sugar in the sweet tea. Where
to find the microorganisms?
From that shop-bought bottle
of kombucha, of course. But
make sure it’s raw and unfla-
voured to get all the good
stuff. We’ll call this “starter
tea” from now.
Your success depends on the
choice of tea: choose plain
black or green tea, with the
best being the trusty English
Breakfast. Avoid flavoured
teas such as Earl Grey as the
oils in them will destroy the
colony. The sugar you use is
also important – plain white
cane sugar gives the best
results while the impurities in
brown sugar or sugar alterna-
tives are also likely to destroy
the microorganisms. Make
sure the jars and pots you
use are sterilized with boiling
water, not soap or alcohol.
I added four tablespoons
of sugar to a cup of boiling
water, chucking in three tea-
spoons of loose leaf Oolong
tea and let it steep for 20
minutes. When the tea has
cooled down, I poured the
tea and the “starter tea” into
a sterilized glass jar in the
ratio of 7:1. I covered the jar
with a paper towel, secured
it to the brim with an elastic
band and left it in a dark
corner in the cupboard under
the sink.
Knowing that it takes up to
two weeks for a SCOBY to
form, the next few days were
a mixture of excitement of
anxiety. On one night I was
worrying about it so much
I couldn’t sleep. What if it
went mouldy? What if it got
contaminated? What if it turns
into some neon green, radio-
active liquid seeping through
the floor and poisoning my
neighbours below?
On the sixth day, I couldn’t
wait any more and visited the
jar. Guess what? A SCOBY
was floating on the surface
of the brown, sweet tea! It
took the cross-sectional area
of the jar, had a jelly-like
texture and a pinkish colour,
rather like a jellyfish. I left the
SCOBY for another 6 days
until it grew to a thickness of
about 1 cm. I repeated the
same preparation procedure
as above but with twice the
amount of liquid, and added
the new SCOBY mother.
Another week went by,
when the brew should be
ready to drink. A new baby
SCOBY formed across the
surface of the liquid. But much
to my horror, it wasn’t pink
and plump as the first time
round. There were spots of
dark green mould on top, too
gruesome-looking to be pub-
lished on paper. I must have
got the tea:sugar ratio wrong,
or didn’t sterilize the glass jar
enough. I held back my tears,
emptied the failed brew to its
grave, and ended the kombu-
cha cycle. RIP SCOBY.
