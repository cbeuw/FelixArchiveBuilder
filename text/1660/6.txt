act: Your body has
‘tides’ because of the
moon.
They are just really,
really, really small.
The moon causes
tides in the ocean by exerting
a gravitational pull on the
water, which changes over
the course of a day as the
relative positions of the earth
and the moon change. The
gravitational pull of the moon
will, in theory, exert those
same forces on the water
inside your body, meaning
you have high tide and low
tide twice a day.
‘Human tides’ have been
proposed to affect the brain
and be drivers of suicide
and murder, aggressive
behaviour in animals and
even to influence the timing
of menstruation. However,
simply due to us being much,
much smaller than the oceans
and the moon being really,
really far away, the effect of
lunar gravity on an individual
human is in practice so small
as to be immeasurable,
and so it’s unlikely that it
could possibly drive any
sort of change in behaviour
(although this hasn’t stopped
some questionable studies
claiming to have found a
link!)
In fact, the gravitational
field of a mosquito on your
arm would exert a greater
gravitational force on you
than the moon simply by
virtue of being closer, which
puts into perspective just how
little impact this particular
science fact will have on your
life.

Alexandra Lim discusses on how our choice of food gones beyond the need
of eating for survival
Last week I was at a posh
restaurant, because pre-
tending to have money with
mediocre savings is this new
and dangerous trend I have
undertaken. Dessert being my
ultimate weakness, I made a
big deal out of the pre-dessert
and dessert. Meringuelets
shrouded in freeze-dried
raspberries, swimming
blissfully in Chantilly. Then,
a brown sugar tart with a
delicate scoop of stem ginger
ice cream. The ice cream
melted atop the chocolate
mousse nestled under a skinny
membrane of coffee jelly,
and I started to think about
the unspoken connections
between food, body and
mind.
To start, I’d just like to
say that there is a need for
clarification in any field of
knowledge. But there are sur-
prising twists, and in this case
of course I’m talking about the
wild, young, uncertain world
of nutrition. There are lots
of irrefutable nutrition facts,
like how we as humans need
certain nutrients to grow and
develop properly, keep our
brains and bodies optimally
functional. There are different
people who undertake theo-
ries in different ways and with
very different behaviours.
You have X, who treats this
whole nutrition thing very,
very seriously. He has a
Vitamix to keep his wild green
soul satiated in the morning,
and a spoonful of blackstrap
molasses mixed and heated
with turmeric and perhaps
just a dash of spirulina at
night. Turkey is good and
everything else might kill him.
He gets shifty at restaurants.
And all that being said, the
variations of X, whatever diet
culture he may adhere to, are
endless. There’s Y, who likes
to run and have an apple
every day. He tries, but may
forego the strict gym session.
Then there’s people like me
with incredible levity, who are
interested and read up on all
the latest finds, but still don’t
mind the occasional cake-
gorge and wine splurge (yes
wine is good for you, but do
you know how many bottles
you need to get a desirable
amount of resveratrol…?).
I guess X is the good sir
I would like to elaborate
more on now. His soul is
bright when he churns the
kale and frozen bananas
at precisely 8 o’clock every
morning, pouring it into a
clean and wholesome Mason
jar. Mind you, this is all
fictional, and I’m just keeping
in line with less ubiquitous
letters-of-name-beginnings,
so bear with me. The drink is
delicious, and I would agree.
He says he is better than the
18-year-old X who dined on
sausages and milkshakes
without a qualm, all those
years ago. He’s right, and
yet not quite so. Has it ever
dawned on you (yes you,
dear reader), that eating,
despite being this magical,
holistic ritual, this beautiful
constant fest of discovery
and perhaps healthfulness, is
downright scary? No matter
what you consider yourself,
how healthy, how vegan or
carnivorous, that we are still
somewhat the same? No
matter what, we must con-
sume other lifeforms to sustain
ourselves, and in doing so we
transmit energy from one to
the other.
Self-awareness is also
awareness of death. As stated
recently in a very interesting
recent article in the Atlantic,
once we cultivated the means
to indulge ourselves in piles
of grapes and doughnuts,
the Ancients (think Julius,
Cleopatra, Nero), decided
that there was so much more
to life than just having full
bellies, and went on to build
cultural legacies, filled with
meaning and sustenance that
exceeded the physical, with
pyramids, recreation, and
material. Food and eating
went from mere sustenance
to settling exactly in this cate-
gory of recreation, symbolism
and complicated meaning.
We eat to celebrate, or use
\\ It is a irrefutable
fact that humans
need certain
nutrients to grow
and develop
properly \\
\\ No matter what,
we must consume
other life forms to
sustain ourselves,
and in doing so we
transmit energy from
one to another \\
