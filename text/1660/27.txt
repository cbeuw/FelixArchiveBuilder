I
t’s been an amazing
couple of weeks for
women’s rugby, with
three consecutive wins,
all the hard work this
season has really started
to pay off. Most recently with
a glowing 69-10 win over
Kingston and a 38-5 win
against Roehampton the week
before, propelling Women’s
Rugby into the South-Eastern
Conference Cup Semi-Finals.
This improvement can in part
be attributed to the decision
to focus solely on the BUCS
league, and the organisation
of weekly weight lifting
sessions to supplement their
training.
The match against
Roehampton got off to a blis-
tering start, with the first half
dominated by Imperial and
Captain Charlotte scoring a
try within the first play. This
was followed by a somewhat
frustrating 20 minutes as the
ball always remained within
a quarter-pitch of the try line,
but always unable to reach
it. A couple of quicker pops
to the wings as Imperial’s
forwards were tackled could
have seen a better pro-
gression up the pitch, but
proficient rucking over of all
the takedowns and keeping
ball possession throughout
was a strongpoint of Impe-
rial’s game. This stationary
period was ended when
forward Laura broke through
two Roehampton players to
score a try. The game was
paused shortly after as kicker
Moran successfully converted
a little too enthusiastically,
the ball flying over a fence
and into a river carrying it
downstream, never to be
seen again. Several valiant
rescue attempts were made,
but alas - they don’t make
them like they used to and no
player was willing to jump
down the two metre concrete
embankment. To finish an epic
first half Charlotte scored her
second try of the match, with
a hat-trick in sight. 19-0.
The second half began
with ten minutes of intense

with old windsurfing kit
and DJ-ed by our very own
MC-Ooper. Saturday night
led us to Walkabout, Temple.
The theme of the night was
Cockney Rhyming Slang. This
led to funny looks on the tube
with outlandish costumes such
as Birmingham’s Bees and
Honey, and Imperial’s Cows
and Kisses! After partying
away, all visiting students
were hosted by the Imperial
Windsurfing committee in
their cosy houses. The hordes
were fed with pasta bake on
Saturday night and bacon
butties on both mornings.
We would like to thank
Sport Imperial and the SWA
for supporting us throughout
our event preparation and
making this incredible week-
end possible.
L
ondon took centre
stage on the weekend
of the 17th
to 19th
February as over
130 windsurfers
from universities
across the UK descended
on the capital to share in
the thrill of Imperial College
London’s brand new student
windsurfing event: London
Calling! Despite light winds
the weekend was a rip
roaring success and a huge
celebration of sport with
the horizon scattered with
windsurf sails taking in the
February sun. The Student
Windsurfing Association
(SWA) certainly made the
most of the many activities
held both on and off the
water. This weekend will not
be forgotten easily and will
be the first of many to come.
London Calling, aka. Soggy
Cockney, was the last of the
three SWA core events held
this academic year in associ-
ation with Sport Imperial and
Queen Mary Reservoir. This
huge inter-university collabo-
ration attracted windsurfing
clubs from every corner of the
UK. Some clubs even braved
a seven hour haul through
rush hour traffic to join the
fray.
The windsurfing was spread
over both days, with Satur-
day’s main focus on personal
development. Despite the
calm water, eight windsurf-
ing clinics hosted by student
instructors and Queen Mary
Sailing Club instructors
were held. Different levels
of clinics were put on for
beginners, intermediate and
advanced windsurfers. The
wind remained calm so on
Saturday afternoon we held
the Soggy Cockney Low Wind
Olympics. Students competed
on the backs of beginner
boards with tug of war, sprints
and tag featuring among the
rounds.
On Sunday the wind picked
up a bit. Windsurfing com-
petitions of different levels
including beginner, intermedi-
ate, advanced and freestyle
were held. Team racing
however was where Imperial
windsurfing excelled, ranking
4th
out of 14 other university
teams. The freestyle is always
a spectacle, incorporating
impressive tricks and jumps as
windsurfers show off to earn
points for their universities.
Besides windsurfing, we
hosted two after parties.
Friday night was a private
party in Reynolds, decorated
middle play, Roehampton
missing a key opportunity to
kick the ball away from their
half, leading to back Anna
capitalising on a dropped
ball, grabbing it and double
dodging to a try. There were
two further tries by Imperial
before a huge opposing push
towards the end saw Roe-
hampton score their first and
only counter try of the game.
Final match score 38-8, a
great performance with a
wide range of players scoring
tries and conversions.

D
efeated,
downtrodden,
but with a
fervent desire
to win; that’s
how we entered
the season. As Drake so
eloquently put it, “started
from the bottom now we’re
here”. After a winless season
last year we have now risen
to the top. A new coaching
squad and great new recruits
(as well as veteran players)
has enabled us to maintain a
flawless home record. Since
we are top of our division
our first playoff game was
at fortress Harlington. We
will ensure that no team
desecrates our sacred
runway. We surely won’t
allow any Demons to ravage
it. Last Sunday we came
ready to defend our ground
against the 5-3 record Exeter
Demons in the Southern 1st
division Quarter-final. And
defend it we did.
First half saw defence
dominate on both teams. A
few lapses in concentration
allowed the Demon’s Quar-
terback to escape outside
picking up a few yards,
also, as if recently escaped
from hell, their running back
barrelled his way through
the Immortals Defensive line.
These advances were stopped
by Jason ‘The Enforcer’
Patrick Kuilan, with some
savage hits, he ensured they
did not want to make it to
the second level again. Due
to the weather conditions,
both teams’ offense were
very dependent on ground
and pound run games. The
effects of this playing style
can certainly be felt the day
afterwards. Lots of aches
and bruises, but fortunately
there are no lasting injuries.
A standout player on the day,
for causing much disruption in
the Demon’s run game, was
Kem ‘The Furious Confusion’
Smooth. He often found him-
self in the back field, much to
his own amazement as much
as anyone else’s, getting
sacks. This is his second ever
game playing American Foot-
ball and second week playing
defence. For his crazily ath-
letic plays he was awarded
‘best rookie defensive player’
on the day. The offensive
side of the ball was rather
unproductive, and it seemed
to take a while for them to
warm up and start to record
some yards.
The second half was much
more eventful on offence. This
was mainly attributed to Guil-
laume ‘postcorner’ Fontan’s
very physical and aggressive
running. Tumbling, crashing
and pummelling through the
Demon’s defence; he ensured
that we got the yardage we
needed. For his monumen-
tal effort on offence (and
defence), regardless of the
fact he was playing through
bad shoulder injuries, he
was awarded offensive MVP.
One humble hero that made
many of these plays possible,
making massive holes for
which G to pass through,
was Zinedine Da-Sam Hill.
Without his aggressive
blocking, that caused many
a pancake to be formed, the
offense would not have been
able to function. He has been
the staple of the offense for
many years, but recently he
has made appearances on
defence where he made great
plays too. Although offensive
and defensive line are not
the most glamorous positions,
they are vital to the success
of a team. The overall MVP,
in perhaps one of the most
exciting games of Immortals
history (a bold statement),
was awarded to Shill. A
player that has been selflessly
dedicated to the team over
the last few years; the award
could not have been better
deserved. Another humble
and very important role was
played by rookie John ‘Clay
Matthews’ Lister, whose
plays at offensive line gave
him Lineman MVP. Without
the offensive line stepping
up the team would not have
been able to win. Immortals
defence were as dominant
as always ensuring that no
Demon could score touch-
downs. Unfortunately the
Demon’s defence was equally
impenetrable.
Late in the fourth quarter
the score was still 0-0. Immor-
tals had been unable to drive
successfully, the Demon’s
offense were handed the
ball with less than a minute
to go. They started marching
up the field toward our
endzone. Our defence, that
had been consistent all day,
seem strained by the rallying
Demon’s. The tension was
palpable on the Immortals
side line; this was do or die.
Every sinew of our heart,
mind and soul had been sown
into the fabric of each game
we played. We wore this
cape into every battle as a
memory of how far we had
come. From relegation to top
of the league had required
a ferocious desire to win.
We still had that desire as
the Demons made it well into
field goal range… We finally
curbed their advances, but
this time it was too late. The
Demons were only 15 yards
from the uprights. All they
needed was a field goal to
secure the win. We had failed
Mother Harlington. But she
did not fail us. At the moment
the field goal was going to
be taken Mother Harlington
struck the field with great
vengeance and furious anger.
A hailstorm made it impossi-
ble to make the kick, and the
game ticked over into sudden
death overtime.
After Mother Harlington
smiled down on us, we
protected her yet again and
came away with the win. 6-3,
the Demon’s managed to get
a field goal but we scored
a touchdown. We are now
off to the Southern Division
1 Semi-finals against the
Cardiff Cobras. #BecomeIm-
