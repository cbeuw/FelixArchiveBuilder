The Dance Imperial show 2017
Eirill Mehammer
N
ext week, for
the third year
in a row, all
dancers at
Imperial are
going to come
together and show that it is
not wise to underestimate the
motor skills of scientists and
that it’s time to start thinking
about taking dance classes to
become just as light-footed as
DI’s performers!
DI is presenting the Dance
Imperial Show 2017, a joint
venture between the six
different dance societies at
Imperial – spicing up the
night by supporting four excit-
ing collaborations between
the wide range of dance
styles Imperial has on offer.
Expect to see some interest-
ing new creations resulting
from innovative fusions,
exploring the similarities but
also the differences between
the various styles.
For those of you not versed
in dance styles, here is a
quick overview of everything
that Imperial’s dancers have
officially embraced: there is
traditional belly dancing, as
well as a more experimental
tribal fusion belly dancing.
Hip-hop, breakdancing, pole,
aerial, ballet, contemporary,
jazz, and tap are also repre-
sented, with weekly classes
and rehearsals taking place
for each style. If you prefer
a partner, you can sign up
for International Ballroom, as
well as Latin, Salsa, Bachata,
or even Swing and Rock
n’ Roll! There is so much to
choose from, it is hard to
remind yourself that you’re
not actually, regrettably, stud-
ying dance.
The Dance Imperial Commit-
tee has worked hard to create
and support a collaborative
atmosphere between all the
dance societies, starting with
a big workshop weekend
in November to get the ball
rolling for show piece audi-
tions in January and weekly
rehearsals from then on. This
year’s choreographers have
spent hours and hours on
their original show pieces,
blending together different
styles to create something
unique and harmonious.
Equally, our dancers have
been open to stepping out of
their comfort zone and trying
new things, even patiently
moving furniture on a weekly
basis to keep rehearsing as
many times as needed to be
able to inspire you with novel
dance fusions.
There is a variety of perfor-
mances to be excited about,
with several pieces that have
won awards at inter-university
dance competitions across the
country. Funkology travelled
all the way to Edinburgh to
show the Northerners how
it’s done, while Pole & Aerial
were busy in Metric hosting
and slaying it at London Pole
Varsity 2017. Belly Dance
dazzled everyone at their
first ever dance competition
in Warwick, whereas Dance
Club are so used to their
medals and trophies that the
victories at multiple dance
be a big social in the Union
Bar downstairs, celebrating
Imperial’s dance-related
successes this year. Everyone
is welcome to what promises
to be a night filled with great
dancing and good moves, so
keep an eye out on Facebook
for soon-to-be revealed
details about this unmissable
after party!
If you have read this
patiently and are getting
excited about the idea of
taking dance classes, please
join Dance Imperial and don’t
hesitate to try out any styles
that tickle your fancy. More
information about Dance
Imperial and the other six
affiliate dance societies can
be found online. Please also
feel free to get in touch with
the Dance Imperial Com-
mittee under dance.imp@
imperial.ac.uk, we are happy
to answer any remaining
questions.
Right after the show, on
Sunday 19th
, Dance Imperial
is supporting a Zumba
Charity event taking place in
the Union Dining Hall from
4-5pm. What better way to
de-stress after an intensive
week of performing by letting
loose in a fun, energetic
Zumba class! Knowing that
all the proceeds go to charity
will help you give it your all
and get all the tension out.
Everyone is welcome!

Dance Company returned
from the second successful
competition this term, and
are now getting busy for the

ICSM Dance though – they
have exciting events coming
up this week and performing
will be an old hat for them by
the time the DI Show comes
around!
On top of these exciting
pieces, there will be four
dances that have been
created as performance-only
pieces and this will be your
exclusive chance to see them
all for the last time in one
breath-taking show night.
Since this is something you do
not want to miss, you should
get your tickets now, because
they are known to sell out
fast! Show dates are Thursday

Netball Club ExeTour
15 of Imperial Netball Club’s finest take Devon. And also play some Netball.

n the lead up to Varsity,
most clubs double up on
training, start running
extra fitness classes and
generally work even
harder on their sport.
Naturally, netball chose to
spend the weekend partying
in Exeter. Getting the first bus
out of London, 15 girls from a
mixture of all 6 teams headed
into Exeter tired but excited to
see what the night life is like
for other universities. Despite
not getting to the hotel until
ten, the squad headed back
out an hour later.
Conveniently our night out
was only 5 minutes down the
road at Unit 1. It would be a
lie to say that the discovery of
£4 doubles and the ability to
get a drink without queuing
for over half an hour wasn’t
significant for a group of girls
who spend their nights out
in one of the most expensive
cities in the world. It was also
interesting to see how the
local students reacted to a
bunch of city girls. Our social
sec Sophia managed to
amass a group of locals who
spent the evening cheering
on her dance moves which
was both confusing and
amazing in equal measure.
Don’t let anyone say that
ICUNC dance moves are not
impressive.
Our two netball matches
started very early the next
day, with everyone drag-
ging themselves and their
hangovers out by nine the
next day ready to play some
matches. The first match
was played by a mixture
of players from the 3rd
,4th
and 5th
teams and they did
well to adapt to playing in
combinations and positions
that were new to them. The
girls in defence did really
well to keep up with a very
fast attacking side and got in
some great marking practice
ahead of Varsity. Siu’s per-
formance in mid court was
especially impressive consid-
ering the fact that she played
in both games. The second
team was composed of five 1s
team players, Zoe from the 2s
and our club captain Minnie.
Minnie’s team mates on the 3s
were especially vocal about
Minnie’s performance on the
court which included some
great shots from the outer
circle. Kath took charge of
the team’s defensive strategy
of the game, switching effec-
tively with Annie and getting
some great tips in. Despite
playing 32 minute matches at
full effort, our teams were out-
played by a more skilled and
the whole was a slightly mess-
ier night than Friday without
the promise of more netball
to be played the next day
and the majority of the team
stayed until the place closed.
Special shout-out goes to
fresher Olivia who crashed at
Spoons at 10 before making
a strong comeback at Time-
piece later on in the evening.
Real MVP of the trip. Also
thanks go to Exeter University
Netball club for playing a
match on a Saturday and
showing us all the best night
life in the city.
There’s a lot coming up
for ICUNC before the end
of term this year. Firstly, the
1s team are the showcase
match at Varsity this weekend
at 3:30 in front of what
is normally a particularly
animated crowd. Then next
weekend is the annual netball
funday starting at 1 on 11th
of Saturday. The event is a
mini tournament between any
group of friends who think
they’re up to playing with us
seasoned netballers. Mixed
teams are also allowed, so
boys who always say they’d
be great at netball, time to
put your money where your
mouth is!

Final scores 30-7 and 43-18.
After the matches, lack of
sleep and intense hunger
kicked in so the whole team
headed to a local restaurant
to eat our weight in carbs,
although Zoe’s total failure
to finish off her mountain of
nachos was definitely the
most disappointing event
of the weekend. After a
restorative nap, ICUNC
headed back out to meet the
Exeter netball team at the
local Wetherspoons to pre
drink. That’s right, Exeter is
so cheap you can pre drink
at a bar. Exeter netball team
helped to decided where to
head out on a Saturday night,
which for our group ended up
being a club called Timepiece
in the city centre. Saturday on
