Immersing yourself in a good book
or comic can provide you with the
perfect opportunity to practice self-
care – it gives you time to sit down,
chill out, and totally engross yourself
in the power of words and images.
felix Editor Lef Apostolakis gives his
own personal recommendation: LOW,
a comic series of dazzling beauty
L
ife without art is not
worth living”
I don’t often write
reviews. I find it hard
to judge someone’s
work – partially
because I never feel like
I have the authority or
knowledge to publicly share
my personal criticism, and
partially because I believe in
making art for the sake of art,
which makes it even harder
for me to think along the lines
of a review-format. But I felt I
should make an exception for
LOW; not only has it become
one of my favourite reads,
but it has also, unexpectedly,
entered my ritual of self care.
LOW is a comic series, set in
a futuristic, underwater, some-
what post-apocalyptic world,
where the Sun’s progression
into a red giant has unexpect-
edly sped up, forcing humans
to recede into the deep to
take cover from their star’s
radiation.
We enter the timeline mil-
lennia later, at a point where
humanity seems to quite
literally be on its final few
breaths of air, and the last
remaining human colonies
are on the verge of collapse.
The story centres around Stel
and her shattered family,
who is attempting a trip to
the surface in order to collect
a space probe which might
contain the coordinates of a
hospitable world.
During the course of her
self-assigned mission, she
discovers lost worlds only
to shatter them, encounters
beautiful creatures only
to eradicate them, and is
trapped in a constant back
and forth between finding
and losing her family, her
objective, her hope, her life.
Though the story at first
glance seems to be little
more than an adventure
packed with action, sex, and
violence, what writer Rick
Remender really deals in is
hope. In this world he has
constructed, hope becomes
quite literally a commodity.
In one of the colonies, Salus,
hope and optimism have
become a pointless religion,
abandoned in the face of
humanity’s inevitable end
in favour of an Epicurean
existence centered around
pleasure, its residents literally
living their final moments in a
garden of Eden. What’s the
value of hope when you’ve
“seen the truth and you’ve
accepted it”, when “the
Universe has given you the
middle finger?” one of the
elected leaders asks Stel.
In another colony, Voldin,
hope is seen as dangerous,
becoming contraband; its
propagation punishable by
death. Artists go under-
ground, and attempts to
inspire the hope-starved
populace are seen as a major
threat to stability and sur-
vival, in need of suppression
by the Ministry of Thought.
Hope is seen as dangerous
because of its ability to lift up
its bearers, only to bring them
crashing down when it’s inev-
itably proven to be false: “the
only to be torn apart again;
they search for their purpose
only to realise it involves their
sacrifice; they find love only
to experience heartbreak. At
points, hope is the only thing
powering them, pushing them
forward. And while they suc-
cessfully manage to overcome
whatever ridiculous obstacle
they’re faced with, they do so
only to plunge deeper into an
abyss of despair.
Meanwhile, Greg Toc-
chini’s artwork perfectly
complements this constant jux-
taposition of hope and futility,
optimism and nihilism. His
lines are loose, and his col-
ouring work flows effortlessly
through shapes and panels.
Though his illustrations have
the clear purpose of communi-
cating this epic, they might as
well not: they often seem like
nothing more than windows in
this beautiful world residing in
Remender’s mind, stills from
a natural history documen-
tary, a glimpse of nature and
the universe which simply
exist defiantly, purposelessly.
The series is full of gratui-
tous sequences of beautiful
silence. Expertly designed
panels calmly illustrate the
thriving world that humans
are desperately trying to
escape from. Vibrant life and
colour contrast humanity’s
bleak and anthropocentric
perception of their world.
It takes twelve issues, and
humans setting foot on the
Earth’s surface for the first
time after thousands of years,
for someone to finally utter
the bitter truth. “Hubris.
Proposing that we were the
last embers of some unique
flame…. We are not unique.
Our absence wasn’t felt. Life
continued on. As if we’d never
been.”
LOW is truly a work of art.
I recommend its consumption
in volumes as its reading
en-mass becomes a long pro-
cess, one that requires setting
time aside for it and for you.
Take your time reading it, and
allow your eyes to drift as you
lose yourself in the wonderful
illustrations, as you discover
purposeless detail, as you
consider the composition
of the panels, trying to find
meaning that may or may
not be there. Take time to
love the characters who are
so beautifully constructed,
to know their hopes, and
see their flaws crush them.
Allow your breath to catch up
with your heart as catharsis
washes over you and you sit
there numb, after your expec-
tations have failed to be met.
Give yourself space for when
you’re brought low.

U
gly Lies the
Bone follows the
story of Jess, a
young woman
returning home
following 3
tours in Afghanistan, which
have left her with severe
burns after an IED. Struggling
to fit back into her old life in
her declining Florida home
town, and struggling to cope
with her disability and chronic
pain, Jess becomes involved
in a virtual reality therapy
program. The disembodied
voice of a therapist guides
her through this experience,
helping her create new
worlds to overcome her pain
and frustration.
Although it sounds like a
product of fantasy, the virtual
reality therapy at the centre
of Ugly Lies the Bone is
actually based in reality: the
world Jess visits is based on
SnowWorld, a virtual reality
experience created in the late
90s and used to help victims
of severe burns with chronic
pain. Although SnowWorld
itself is no longer in use, it has
led to the creation of other
virtual reality experiences
and technology – one of
these is Cool!, a snowscape
populated by otters and float-
ing fireballs, which has been
used in experimental trials to
treat sufferers of chronic pain
– and these real world impli-
cations add an interesting
extra dimension to the play.
The production itself is
visually striking. The stage
is a hemisphere with sloping
sides, giving an interesting
depth to the virtual reality
moments, and the play tran-
sitions smoothly between the
surreal world of the virtual
reality program and the
unremarkable reality of Jess’
hometown. This beautifully
mirrors Jess’ shifting emo-
tional states – her hesitant
wonder at the world created
by the virtual reality and the
awkward pain of being a
poor fit for her old life.
Kate Fleetwood is a com-
pelling Jess, fluidly shifting
between drawing laughs
with her delivery of dry and
sarcastic humour, and heart
rending raw emotion in her
portrayal of physical and
emotional struggles. She is
particularly brilliant at cap-
turing the physical difficulties
Jess faces due to her multiple
skin grafts: her movements
capture the physical pain as
well as the psychological toll
the changes to her body are
exerting. In one particularly
unforgettable scene, Jess
attempts to change from her
comfortable ‘boys clothes’ to
a pretty dress – Fleetwood
beautifully captures Jess’s
physical struggle against
her own body, as well her
emotional turmoil at wanting
the dress.
The rest of the cast certainly
doesn’t let her down. Ralf
Little is endearing as Stevie,
Jess’ awkward former
boyfriend. Their interactions
are emotionally charged, at
first with the awkwardness
of change, but evolving
gradually into a complex
portrait of love and loss
and regret. Olivia Darnley
plays Jess’ sister Kacie who
struggles to support Jess’
recovery. Though it sometimes
feels forced and cliché, her
cheerfulness and relentless
optimism are a great contrast
to Jess’ pain and frustration.
The play is not without its
flaws: though the characters
are emotional and compel-
ling, their interactions are
sometimes predictable and
lack emotional depth. The
virtual reality too has its short-
comings; although visually
striking, it lacks the emotional
impact of Fleetwood’s
performance.
Despite this, it's undeniable
that Ugly Lies the Bone leaves
an impression. The strong cast
and storytelling as well as the
visual beauty of the virtual
reality combine to create a
truly immersive experience.
Ugly Lies the Bone is on at
the National Theatre until 6th
June. Tickets from £15
