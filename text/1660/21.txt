pparently it was
international
women’s day this
week? I mean I
only noticed as
the women in
my office were doing even less
work than they usually do and I
assumed they were celebrating
the fact that they menstruate
once a month or something like
that. I don’t really understand
what there is to celebrate about
consistently earning less than
your male equivalent for the same
job or having to repeatedly fight
for your right to choose whether
or not you have a baby, but it
has been medically proven that
women have smaller brains than
men (Borat et al, 2006) so that
may play a role in it. Apparently
there is an international men’s
day on November which doesn’t
really make much sense to me
since being a white man is reason
to celebrate each and every
day so why do we only get one
recognised day.
I hear that the theme of this
week’s rag is some neo-liberal shit
about self care. There is only one
important self-care protocol that I
follow and that involves firmly grip-
ping your genitals and rhythmically
rubbing them – I don’t need any
known homosexuals telling me this.
I have to say it’s not a big surprise
that these liberals are asking for
time to self-care when they’ve been
receiving hand outs every day of
their life – they’ve self-cared too
much I think. Look at the NHS –
these junior doctors have probably
caught wind of this idea, and think
they need to work less hours for
their self-care – here’s an idea
DO SOME FUCKING WORK.
They spend six year’s drinking
and fucking each other and then
at the very end they want to com-
plain about doing a day’s work.
Scroungers. All of them. I’ll tell
you why there’s a bed shortage:
too many fatties being too lazy.
Yes you’ve got cancer, but you still
have legs right? Think of all the
coma patients that are wasting
valuable space – if they’re not
conscious, they’re not in need of
a bed. As long as you keep them
away from any 70’s BBC television
stars, then there is no reason not
to just put them all in one room –
maybe stack them?
Oh yeah don’t forget to vote
in the ICU elections so that I can
get my free drinks in on Friday.
This rag needs to be reduced to a
PDF as soon as possible so that I
can spend the column money on
lubricant. Industrial mint flavoured
if you must known.
S
elf-care is the most
important regime of
my day. Whenever I
get stressed by current
events or the anxiety
of having my parents
paying for this three year holiday
(my English literature degree),
I go through my regime, and I
come through the other side,
ready to face whatever trolls have
commented on my vegan cooking
blog this week. As a side note, can
pussydestroyer457 please stop
posting photos of pornstars with
Alice Gast’s face photoshopped
onto them and calling me a fag.
Thanks. I start my regiment off with
bathing in lightly sweetened soya
milk, making sure I wash below
the glans and right in the urethra
as there is no sweeter feeling than
a dairy-free urethra. The next step
is some nice exfoliation using the
finest pumice from Bolivia and a
little bit of jellyfish extract (vegan
of course) mixed in with hummus
(well I’m white aren’t I). I then
start by focussing on my testicles,
making sure to get rid of all the
excess skin and bran flakes that
have accrued there.
Once I have taken care of the
skin situation, I then move onto
my haircare regimen involving
various serums and conditioners,
all overpriced but cruelty free.
First I use my avocado and quinoa
hair serum (Editor’s note: This is
genuinely a real vegan shampoo.
They are beyond parody) [Real
Editor’s note: This may or may not
be true], first taking two handfuls
and gently rubbing them into my
pubic area; however, I do have
to remain vigilant, as you’d be
surprised how quickly this can turn
into me wanking. Next I move onto
the cauliflower conditioner which is
important for maintaining the gloss
and modest scent of vegetables,
an essential quality for me in day
to day life. Eventually I move onto
the hair on my head, but as you
guessed, the secret to a happy life
is well kept balls, and so I rub this
good stuff all over the wrinkles and
crevasses. Whilst doing this you
may also find time to investigate
your gonads for any lumps and
bumps in order to detect whether
or not you have any tumours;
however, once again I would
advise readers to be careful when
performing this procedure as it has
led to many a wank on my part.
Once the body has been taken
care of, the mind must also be
comforted. For me this consists
of going onto the KFC Facebook
page and commenting on every
post about the amount of carbon
that eating chicken creates. Of
course once again I have to ensure
that I don’t masturbate to my sheer
wittiness, but often I fail, leading
to me having to clean the laptop
with recycled tissues. I feel very
self-cared for though.
I constantly self-care
and no, I don’t mean
wank... mostly
Jonathan Masters’ takes us
through his daily regimen of
self-care, which mostly involves
slathering lotions on their bod
You don’t need to
self-care, you’re on
constant holiday
you student scum
Monathan Jasters doesn’t need to
self-care, he’s a man who has an
obedient woman caring for him
