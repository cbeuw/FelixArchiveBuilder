Treasures from the Levant
felix visits Ceru, a new addition to
the South Ken restaurant scene that
oozes middle eastern comfort, from
the warm, welcoming interior to the
sumptuous yet refined food. So that
you too can treat yourselves to an
excellent meal out, we’ve arranged
an exclusive Imperial discount.
T
o look on at the birth
of a new restaurant
is always exciting –
I’ve been a part of
it, having seen the
place I worked at in
Oxford rise from the ashes
of a mediocre Italian cocktail
bar, and realising that I really
wanted to be a part of that.
Teething problems ranged
from gutters that drained into
the balcony (we bailed it out
with saucepans, literally) to
much more minor tweaks, like
who supplied our bread. The
tentative first few months were
some of the most stressful
and intense that I have ever
worked. It was therefore
amazing to me to step into
the fresh faced Ceru, in South
Kensington, and witness a
polished, refined machine that
was only three months into its
operation. I’d cycled past it
for the few months that it took
to strip away the previous
occupant and revitalise the
interiors, and so knew that it
was absolutely brand new,
and yet when I went, it looked
like it had been a local fixture
for ages. So how had they
done it?
Simple – they’d meticulously
planned before they opened.
Barry and Patricia Hilton,
the husband-and-wife team
behind Ceru, tested many of
the ideas beforehand with
their successful pop-up under
the same name – visiting
festivals, private dinners
and shows to serve simple,
yet delicious dishes from the
Levant to a huge audience.
It’s reasonable therefore
to say that they have some
experience, and inside the
restaurant it shows. I’ve
visited twice now – for a
post exam lunch, and a more
relaxed breakfast. The former
trip was an escape from the
drizzle we have been used
to over the past few months,
and the cosy booths, lit with
beautiful geometric lighting
on the walls behind, provided
a warm embrace to whip
away any memories of either
the weather, or the equally
miserable exam that I had just
sat. And yet when I visited
on a bright spring morning
last week, it was equally
as homely in the early rays
of sunshine that were just
peeking under the deep blue
awning. The whole restaurant
took on a brilliant palette of
colours, with the patterned
seating, tiles and lights
transporting me straight back
to one of the many cafés in
Istanbul – one of my favourite
cities, especially for food and
drink.
Post exam, we decided that
cocktails were a necessary
fix for our mood. A Cucum-
ber Martini (made without
Hendricks, something I am
personally glad to see the
end of) and a delightful gin-
and-Campari based Trouble
in Paradise quickly lifted our
spirits, and in perfect sync
with the cocktails arrived the
first dishes, a rarity in some
restaurants these days. With
their tagline of “Share the
flavours of The Levant”, don’t
expect dainty portions for
you to nibble at and politely
enquire how everyone is
enjoying their food – you’ll
want to ask your lab partner
for some of their creamy
roasted aubergines with
piquant, earthy chermoula,
and expect to trade it for suc-
culent, tender lamb shoulder
– two of my favourite dishes,
and both wonderfully exe-
cuted: the lamb not too fatty,
yet unctuous still, and the
aubergines roasted enough
to give a smoky tang but not
an ashtray like sting. The
Village Salad cleansed us in
between mouthfuls, providing
a wonderful fresh contrast
and packing flavours of its
own, with fried capers and
sumac to give it body. Lunch
finished with some of the best
fried halloumi – something I
normally regard as the most
humble of dishes, but one that
here was a stand out hit with
everyone, with the fruity red
peppers and harissa cutting
the perfect balance to the
crispy, golden cheese.
The biggest success of the
day, however, was for my
coeliac friend, who I must
confess I normally dread
taking to a new restaurant.
Quite by accident, the All
Day Menu is entirely gluten
free (avoiding the pita bread,
understandably), leaving
her gawping like a kid in
a toy shop, able to choose
whatever she wanted without
hunting for the illusive (g) on
the menu.
They haven’t managed the
universal gluten-freeness on
their breakfast menu – but
there are plenty of delicious
options to choose from.
Sweet, soothing Apple Tea to
start, followed by shakshouka
(just-baked eggs in spiced
tomato sauce) with tender,
perfectly cooked merguez
sausage is the divine mid-
dle-eastern equivalent of a
Full English, without making
me feel quite as guilty after-
wards. To see it away, some
homemade Basil-honey lem-
onade and fresh breads, with
black olive, feta and barberry
jam. Not quite a substitute for
a trip to the med, but a very
close second.
It’s inspiring to see the rise
of a new restaurant like Ceru
– and wonderful to have
graced its doors before the
inevitable crowds of regulars
appear. Get there soon, or
you’ll have to queue round
the block.
And exclusive to Imperial
students, so that you and
friends can also treat your-
selves to a post exams meal:
10% off your total bill at Ceru
on presentation of a valid
Imperial College ID, for up to
four people. Who says felix

ample meal, £9 express lunch

Liquid Comfort
Thepenicillin for all woes,we couldn’t
leave booze out of the comfort
equation, especially when it makes
you feel so damn good. We’ve taken
a range of scenarios that we found
ourselves in over the last few weeks
and developed extensively tested
cures. Don’t worry, alcohol free
options are available.
T
his will start as usual,
with a funny story.
I wanted to write
about some lamb
ribs - see, I kind of
have a thing with
ribs, but then the subject
changed to comfort food (I
am stating this in case you
didn’t notice already) and
because East Europeans don’t
do comfort foods, they do
alcohol, here I am.
My sincere opinion is that
alcohol shouldn’t be mixed
with anything else; also,
different kinds of alcohols
shouldn’t be mixed. I mean,
yes, some of the cocktails
and different mixtures found
in shots are cool, but not too
often. I know, I’m disappoint-
ing the student spirit in you,
but, hey, as a person who can
drink a whole bottle of vodka
(a medium one) and not end
up in a hospital, trust me that I
know what I’m talking about.
So, here are the best com-
fort drinks depending on the
situation:

Your goldfish died?
This one requires
something very strong,
because, let’s face it, you
loved that goldfish! And
it dared to die! Son of a
bitch! But you still miss
it! Ok, we get it, your
feelings are very contra-
dictory. If you feel fancy,
go somewhere where you
can find some Corpse
Reviver (Lillet Blanc, Gin,
Blue Curacao, Lime Juice,
Absinthe and lemon), but
don’t treat your fish with
that. Who knows, you
might start a zombie apoc-
alypse! Or you can just
go for the pure absinthe.
Stronger, but you actually
need that strength, right?
You ran out of money?
Your parents decided
that you don’t deserve
that much anymore?
Your student loan is... not
coming fast enough? Oh,
well, then you shouldn’t
drink. That simple. But you
still can probably afford a
couple of beers. But, well,
if you really want some
comfort, go and have an
amazing freakshake and
indulge into too much
chocolate. Or get some
chocolate milk at home
while watching some
Netflix. We know it’s not
alcohol, but you will still
feel better and without a
migraine.
Your algae just died? And
they keep dying?
Yes, this is specially
directed to biologists. But,
well, if any of your exper-
iments died/exploded/
failed/weren’t muddy
enough while you weren’t
on watch, just take your
group mates and head for
the closest place where
you can enjoy some really
good Kamikaze (Vodka,
Triple Sec and Lime) or A
Kick in the Crotch (Vodka,
Blue Curacao, Cranberry
Juice) but don’t take it too
literally. Alternatively, go
for a healthy detox and
blitz that algae with some
kale, quinoa and blueber-
ries. That will take your
mind off their death.
You did not, in fact, pass
that exam?
Oh, it happens even to the
best of us, don’t worry.
But if you failed your
exam because of drinking,
maybe you should ask
yourself some serious
questions and stop drink-
ing. Ask for help? I don’t
know – but if you failed
your exams because you
were too stressed, then
you need some help to
relax. Maybe you want
to feel like Alice in Won-
derland (Grand Marnier,
Tequila, Tia Maria) and
combine oranges and
coffee, or experience
a Mind Eraser (Vodka,
Kahlua, 7-Up).
Did he/she break up with
you over text?
Well, I suggest you to find
a bottle of vodka. Forget
about them! Forget about
the fact that you should
be studying! Forget about
everything! But if you
don’t want to be in this
college for one more year,
just head to the closest
place that has nipples -
pun intended - and try
a Buttery Nipple or a
Slippery Nipple; basically,
just some Baileys Irish
Cream and Butterscotch
Schnapps. Or something
very sweet and creamy - a
White Russian maybe.
..and there is a wide range of medicine
