Prince of Tides
The Prince of Tides is an adaptation
of Pat Conroy's .1987 bestselling
novel. It is an intelligent,
compassionate, sad, if at times
harsh look at the interaction of
people and events that affect the
bearing of ones life.
Barbara Streisand produced,
directed and stars in the film, her
second film as director since
Yentle. She handles the concept 1
with remarkable integrity. She
previously starred in the film Nuts,
whose main theme also centered on
the wonders of psychotherapy
healing the wounds of a troubled
and marred childhood.
The story is of Tom Wingo (Nick
Nolte), an out of work South
American English teacher/coach.
He travels to New York leaving
behind a confused wife (Blythe
Danner) and loving family. He is
requested by his sister's
psychiatrist,. Susan Lowenstein
(Barbara Streisand), to give her an
insight into his sister's repeated
attempts at suicide. Tom is initially
unnerved and hostile in the presence
of Lowenstein and is unwilling to
open up to her, but his love for his
sister (Melinda Dillon) overcomes
his reservations.
Lowenstein is caught in a stale,
unhappy marriage to an arrogant,
domineering husband (Jerome
Krabbe) and has an estranged son.
During his stay in New York Tom
befriends Lowenstein's son Bernard
(Jason Gould) by giving him
coaching lessons.
Tom is afflicted by the same
childhood traumas as his sister,
caused in essence by their flawed
parents. Tom struggles to tell their
Father of the Bride
Faffier of the Bride is a remake of
the 1950 classic but unfortunately,

starts to lose all rationality and his
eyebrows take over. Through all the
trials he has to face, George's wife,
Diane Keaton, tries to gently bring
him down to earth (or at least their
idyllic family home) and to foot the
bill which at my guess was in the
region of seventy thousand pounds.
The reason for this extravagance—
the wedding co-ordinator Franck
(pronounced Fronck) Eggelhoffer
daddy's nightmare come true
through his eyes. As such he cannot
make sense of Fronck either but the
women can and revel in his
willingness to help George part with
seventy grand. The film seems to
have ibeen made for middle-age
parents as a warning of what is to
come. Keaton and Martin make
plausible parents but another
Culkin, as the other child, also
remembered as fondly. Steve
Martin progresses from the inane
humour, so broadly acclaimed, to
become the over anxious father
whose daughter, Kimberly
Williams, grows up overnight and
proclaims her intentions to get
married to computer interfacing
whizz, George Newburn. Almost
from the words 'I'm getting
married' George Banks (Martin)
and his sidekick Howard Weinstein.
It was Fronk who is the most
irksome in this film, his camp
flamboyancy is supposed to mirror
Otho in Beetlejuice but he seems to
take his accent that one step too far
so that half the time you cannot
understand what he is saying.
However, the writer/director/
producers Nancy Meyers and
Charles Shyer wanted us to see
without spontaneity is a bit much.
Without Steve Martin and his
amazing eyebrows to attract our
interest and entice us to fork out a
fiver, this film would decend into
the realsm of obscurity. Thankfully
the cast is there to save the
day—just.

past. With encouragement and
warmth from Lowenstein he is able
to confront his hidden grief and
pain. A deep trust and
understanding develops between
them. This gives to Lowenstein a
renewed faith in herself and they
fall in love.
Streisand is admirable and does
not allow the film to slide into a
melodramatic love story. The film
uses flashbacks to depict the
childhood scenes.
Overall the acting is impeccable
and Nolte shines, though at times
he seemed overbearing. In Nolte's
own words: 'The Prince of Tides is
about forgiveness. It's about how
one must come to grips with the past
and move beyond it to a place of
comfort and acceptance with life'.
Prince of Tides open on Friday
21st February at Odeon Leicester
Square.

Star Trek VI
The wrinklies are back! The
Klingon Empire is in trouble and
Spock uses the Enterprise to
spearhead a campaign for peace.
Kirk, once more, shows what an
opinionated bastard he is. All the
old crew lend a hand. Even Sulu—
who is now Captain of the
Excelsior, remember—launches a
few photon torpedoes. Contrary to
popular rumour Spock does not 'get
off with anybody. Someone must
have miscalculated when his next
'pon fart' (??—TS) was.
The special F X are good, and
deserve 70mm. The plot is ok. The
Shakespearean quotes irritating:
'You must read it in the original
Klingon!'
This is supposed to be the last
Star Trek film. Not so! this is
definitely setting the scene so that
the Next Generation team can take
over the silver screen, as they have
done to the T V networks. And you
won't get any jokes about Captain
Packard's toupee.
If you like space shoot 'em ups,
see this. You don't have to be a
trekkie.
