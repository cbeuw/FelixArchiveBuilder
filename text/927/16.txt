21 February 1992 Felix 927 Opinion
Yes, oh yes, I can assure the right honorable gentleman opposite that
we are indeed proceeding in a negative direction to macroeconomical
impecuniousness and insofar as the sense of syntax can be strefched,
so shall it remain.
government policy in the past, and
the fact that these groups have not
completed student research for two
years may be due more to their
falling out of favour since the
demise of Margaret Thatcher than
to any apparent inactivity, or lack
of interest in a students' charter.
This also covers any anti-
National Union of Students (NUS)
work. Madison Perry told us that
the Adam Smith Institute had no
interest in the NUS. NUS bashing
is therefore left to that last bastion
of open membership, Conservative
Students. Though a senior official
of Conservative Students told IC
Radio News that they had no plans
to take the NUS 'to the cleaners',
the NUS fears a fresh attack on their
position, following a period of
considerable silence.
This 'fresh attack' seems to be the
motive behind the idea that
students' unions should become
self-financing. This chestnut is part
of an old, long running and
thoroughly pathetic attempt by the
government to strangle the NUS.
The scheme is pathetic simply
because it has failed. Utterly. The
only group which is successfully
strangling the NUS is the NUS.
So apart from NUS bashing, what
else is likely to appear in the
students' charter? Not much, really.
There are plans to increase the
speed of payment of your grant, but
not to increase the grant itself.
There are plans for faster loans, but
not fatter loans. Not a whisper on
interest free loans, and certainly
nothing on the graduate tax, as
floated by the Institute of Public
Policy Research and the Fabian
Society, among others.
This gives us a post-it note of a
charter. But what about opposition
plans for a student charter?
According to Labour's Higher
Education spokesman, Andrew
Smith, there are none. Labour
won't introduce a charter, but they
plan to scrap student loans,
introduce a fairer grant system,
restore the vacation hardship
allowance, and bring in targeted
housing assistance. Labour also
opposes moves to reduce student
representation on student governing
body, plans to introduce a pay
review body for lecturers, and
rejects 'perennial attacks on
students' unions from the
Conservative right wing'. No, of
course it isn't a charter. It's a wish
list. The only question they haven't
answered is 'where's the money
coming from?'.
Are the two main parties even
interested in buying the student
vote? Labour, which has for so long
taken the student vote for granted,
have now discovered the harsh
reality that 'student' does not equate
with 'Labour-voting'. The
Conservatives had initial hopes that
this new style floating vote would
drift to them. With this now
improbable, Conservatives have
shown that they are perfectly
capable of by-passing the student
vote, especially in those key
marginals like York. First we saw
the now-you-see-it, now-you-don't
charter. Now we see that come the
election, the student voice may not
even be heard.
