Letters Felix 927 21 February 1992
Fishing in Muddy Water Luddites
Dear Adam,
There are so many examples of
poor management and
incompetence at Imperial that it is
difficult to know which to write
about. We have a Union President
who behaves like a spoiled brat, a
Union Store that has half full
shelves for much of the time and is
forever running out of basic items
such as A4 paper, a snack bar in the
JCR that is 20% more expenesive
than local bakeries—the list is
endless.
However, rather than the
annoying but trivial, I would like to
write about the life-threatening—
the potential death-trap that is
Fisher Hall. In the event of a fire
at night, it is my opinion that many
of us would not get out. This will
not be because of poor access; on
the contrary, Fisher had ten main
escape routes. It will be due to the
inadequacy of our fire alarm. On
the one occasion when it was tested
last term, (at 9am) considerable
numbers didn't hear it, others only
recognised the faint ringing noise in
the background as a fire alarm
because we had heard all the other
fire alarms in Evelyn Gardens being
tested earlier that morning.
I raised these and other points
with Ian Tillet (College Safety
Officer) (Adam—I think that's the
A Bid for Sponsorship
Dear Adam
Imperial College is a renowned
University that seems to take no
advantage of its worldwide
reputation. Good students may
become good clients. Computer
manufacturers should realise that if
IC students get to use advanced
technology equipment, it will have
positive marketing consequences
for Brand X , who provided the
equipment, when these students
graduate and are in a position of
purchasing similar equipment for
their company; one tends to choose
machines one is familiar with. Of
course, if these are tragically out of
date, the image given is a bad one.
Working on old, slow, dumb PCs
all day, I loathe all IBM equipment,
and dream of Apollo or Digital
Equipment workstations. Some
students don't even know what a
good computer is like.
Frigging Pompous
Dear Sir,
I've just read the last edition of
Felix with great amusement, and a
little disappointment. There are at
last some signs of initiative and
humour from across the park. I am
of course talking about the case of
the missing Felices! Whilst in no
way fully endorsing Miss
Hellinger's (and others') actions, it
appeals to me to see any group of
people willing to get up off their
backsides and stop the destruction
of months of hard work.
Far more predictable, however
has been the backlash from Felix,
who as usual have produced
conceited, self-satisfied, editorial
drivvle. What a shame Felix doesn't
use it's potential to inform and
Third World Debt
right description) (Ian Gillet, Safety
Director, I think—Ed) in November
of last year, and was assured that
he would 'look into it' (is this
college-management-speak for T
am going to ignore everything
you've just said'?). As you might
have already guessed, nothing had
been done. I am sure that bodies
such as the Health and Safety
Executive would take a dim view of
such blatant disregard for safety by
senior management, so hopefully
this letter will produce a result.
Yours hopefully,

Dear Adam,
At the union E G M on 6fh
February, a motion concerning
Third World Debt was narrowly
defeated. The motion called on the
union to stamp all cheques which it
processes with the message 'Stamp
Out Third World Debt Now!' and
to send fax messages in protest to
the chairmen of the big four banks.
Neither of these actions would
require much time or expense and,
given that the vote was so close and
that many people seemed confused
by the issues, I feel I must write to
discuss it.
The debt crisis began in the 1970s
when western banks were flooded
with oil dollars following massive
increases in the price of oil. The
banks saw lending to Third World
countries as a safe way of re-
investing this money. Huge loans
were offered, often to despots and
military governments who had no
Manufactures, show them!
Chemical Engineering students,
those of Mechanical Engineering,

the others, do you have all the
equipment you dream of? Do you
even know what to dream of?
Manufacturers, show us!

intention of using them for the
benefit of the poor in their
countries. They were only
interested in buying armaments to
maintain their rule over the people.
The people of these countries saw
no benefit from these loans and are
now burdened with an unpayable
debt.
Today, the total amount owed is
£557 billion, requiring an annual
interest payment of £37 billion. To
attempt just to pay the interest, the
world's poorest countries are forced
into using their resources to produce
cash crops for the west.
Thus, over half the children in
Ghana are malnourished while over
half of Ghana's farming land is
growing cocoa for western
chocolate bars. During the great
drought in the Sahel, production of
peanuts for export actually
increased. Sudan was still exporting
food in 1990 when on the verge of
encourage student opinion, rather
than wallowing in it's own ego.
So come on Felix, get a sense of
humour, get back on the students'
side, and stop being so frigging
pompous!
Yours faithfully,
Chris Sweeting.
famine.
In Brazil, 400,000 children die
each year from hunger related
diseases, yet Brazil is one of the
world's biggest food exporters. The
number of child deaths per year in
Brazil increased 12% in the first
two years of the debt crisis.
Contrary to what is widely
believed, the British banks have not
written off their Third World Debt.
What they have done is to 'provide
for' it, meaning they have assumed
in their accounts that the debt, or
most of it, will never be repaid.
This makes no difference as far as
the countries who owe the money
are concerned. The reason the
banks did this was because they can
claim tax relief on money they set
aside against non-repayment of the
debt. In fact, when they have
provided for the total amount owed,
our banks will have received $7
billion in tax releif, this is three
Dear Adam,
One way to get a machine to eat
your card in eight simple steps:
1. Put card in machine (warning,
fatality approaching).
2. Type in pin number (get it
right).
3. Ask for balance.
4. Get it.
5. When it asks if you want
another service say no (especially
if you mean yes).
6. When it spits out your card,
put it back (big mistake).
7. Lights go off, munch, munch,
munch, bloody munch. Out of order
sign appears.
8. Yell 'Oh F**k' several times.
So what happens now? (In easy
stages.)
1. Go to bank.
2. Wait for 20 minutes
(minimum).
3. Complain bitterly, getting very
p***ed off indeed.
4. Hear them say I'm sorry we
can't open the machine until
Monday.
5. Plead with them.
6. Repeat (4).
7. Write a cheque to cash (no
card).
8. Get asked for ID.
9. Throw an ICU card at them.
10. They give you the money at
last.
11. Repeat (8) from previous list.
12. Turn up to lecture very late.
13. Copy up frantically (still
fuming).
14. Write silly lists because
you're in a bad
mood—understandably.
Yours sincerely,

times Britain's annual foreign aid
budget.
Last year, the Third World
managed to pay the west £25 billion
towards the £37 billion required
interest. It is obvious, not only that
the debt can never be repaid, but
that the Third World cannot even
afford to pay the interest. Each year
the amount owed is more. Each
year the world's poorest countries
try to produce more cash crops,
forcing the value of such
commodities down and so receiving
even less to give to the western
banks. Someday, somehow, all this
is going to have to stop. The most
important thing we can do to help
the people of the Third World is to
convince our bansk that this
suffering is unjustifiable and we're
not going to stand for it.
Yours sincerely,
Mark Richardson, Physics 2.
