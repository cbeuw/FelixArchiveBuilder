Mega City 4 - Sebastopol Road
I don't like Mega City 4. Mega City
4 ruined my life. (This is, you
realise, a completely irrational
statement, and a bare minimum of
people will have the remotest idea
what I'm talking about, as per
usual. ) I'm really pissed off with
the Megas. In fact I'm pissed off
with most things. Now I've got that
out of my system, I shall attempt to
conduct an impartial review.
This album sounds very strange.
Well, not strange really.
Nondescript. Nothing really stands
out. Anne Bancroft is quite a good
track, and there are a couple of
others, but nothing really grabs me
by the throat.
It's just the major(ish) label blues,'
I guess. Big time, Big Life, big
disappointment. Terribly sorry,
Bob.

Let's get this over and done with.
I know you all want to know if this
is the earth shattering debut that
these four likely lads from south
Wales have been promising, or the
complete and utter abortion that you
are expecting. Sorry to disappoint,
but neither. The three singles aside
there are five or six storming tracks
and two or maybe three that at least
make you sit up and take note. But
why oh why did they insist on the
others? A desire to shake the world?
A belief that they will make the
world a better place? You must be
kidding! 'You Love Us' and
'Love's Sweet Exile' are good, but
in the words of a crap advert, 'not
that good'. They do have a nice
habit of switching both style and
tempo just when you expect them
to degenerate into G'n'R mode but
there is still a subtle lack of
originality here. If you want to
make it in the world of guitars these
days you have to have that
something special that set you apart
from the male dominated, male ego-
centric crap that seems to be the 'in'
thing at the moment. They may well
not be the most macho group
around, indeed the lyrics are some
of the best and most poetic for all
of a couple of months. So they
won't wash everybody away in
wave of hysterical admiration, they
won't be able to retire to a tropical
island and forget the world. I for
one would be sad if.they did, for
there is definately a glimmer, a
glint, that shines through. They
have an intellect that is far above the
norm and hopefully second time
around things will be better.
Pebbles.
