Opinion Felix 927 21 February 1992
It can surely be no coincidence
that the suggested date of the
general election, 9 April, falls
during most college and polyversity
holidays. Nasty lefty, subversive
students can then be packed off
home to their safe Labour seats,
removing vital student votes from
key marginals, such as Kensington.
It is also no coincidence that the
proximity of the same general
election has prompted a sudden
interest in student matters, not to
influence students, of course.
Students will see any resultant scam
for what it is. The whole approach
seems to be of duping Joe Public
into believing that Conservatives
care about students.
Felix and The Guardian have
already stated the facts of the story.
The Downing Street policy unit,
under Mrs Sarah Hogg, has been
trawling for new charter ideas to
breath life into a government
publicity exercise which rhas
dissolved in Grecian 2000. Several
brainstorming sessions were held
during January, both in Chequers,
the Prime Minister's country
residence, and in Downing Street.
The results are now beginning to
leak out.
New ideas to date include
charters for health, transport,
schools, road users, benefit offices,
jelly bean manufacturers, train
spotters, union presidents etc. The
Uncharted Waters
'... The idea of students assessing
lecturers' pay is not a Conservative
idea. It's just not on... It may be
something the Labour Party would
do, but it is certainly not one of our
ideas.'
Really? It may be that Ms.
Kesswick has not been fully briefed
by the Secretary of State. It may
also be that she is vehemently
opposed to the idea because the
charter came from the political
section of 10 Downing Street, and
not from the political section of the
Department of Health. Or it could
be that the Conservative Party is
kite flying; leaking an idea to assess
reaction while denying that the idea
even exists. It allows ministers to

It could also be that the general
election has been suggested for
April so that the public can be saved
from a long winded, bitter, sterile
slanging match. Roll up, roll up, the
end is nigh, as placards read just
about everywhere.
And as for proof that
Conservatives care? Who needs it?
The Conservative government has
increased opportunity by increasing
access to higher education. Loans
are designed to allow funding for
those to whom it is not available.
Student numbers are up. A students'
charter would be ideal to improve
on the service.
So why is the Department of
Education and Science denying that
charter plans exist?
The sources that tell us that
charter plans do exist are
impeccable. These people, who
work in the Cabinet Office, have the
ear of the Prime Minister, and they
had the ear of the Prime Minister
at the Downing Street seminar at
which the idea was discussed.
wodge of paper is in danger of
catching up with the multitude of
Labour policy documents, mark
two, of course.
The students' charter emanated
from a Downing Street session. The
Education Secretary was asked by
senior civil servants if he was in
favour of various proposals. M r
Clarke said that he was. These
measures included a formal link
between students' assessments of
lecturers performance and future
lecture pay awards, effectively
giving students influence over
lecturers' pay.
It is this idea which has caused
most of the storm which followed
the revelation of the charter. The
cynicism and hostility which
greeted the move was not confined
to natural government supporters.
Tessa Kesswick, senior policy
advisor to Kenneth Clarke, has
described the measure as 'not a
Conservative idea.' She went on to
say that:
'We might do a students'
charter... we have no plans for a
students' charter, and even if we
had, it would certainly not be on the
terms listed in the Guardian...
do opinion polling without paying
for it, and to withdraw ideas without
losing face.
The old line that something is not
believed until it is officially denied,
does not hold totally true in this
case. Grant Edwards, at the Cabinet
Office Citizen's Charter Unit told
us that 'the idea for a students'
charter may have been discussed'
at the chartermark seminar in
Chequers. We have been told that
the discussion took place at Number
10. What is important here is that
he did not say that no discussion
took place. This is as close as you
will get to a civil servant admitting
that a specific political conversation
took place.
What will go into a students'
charter? The usual source of
Conservative ideas, the 'think
tanks,' don't appear to have any
proposals on the table. Madison
Perry, chairman of the right wing
Adam Smith Institute, told us that
they have done no student work for
two years. Interestingly, the
Institute of Economic Affairs has
also done no student work for two
years. Both these groups have been
exceptionally influential in shaping
