Opinion Felix 927 21 February 1992
Dear Adam,
After reading the plethora of
criticism received over the Grease
review, Rock Soc's bad press and
the performance of the Print Unit,
I finally feel compelled to write.
It is amusing to see Tim Proctor
commending you on your defence
of editorial freedom when he was
one of those involved in the removal
of Felix 924 and the subsequent
censorship that this act caused. The
review of Grease that sparked off
the affair did perhaps play too much
attention to money matters and did
use this as a yard stick by which to
judge the performance. However,
as reviews go, it did seem
reasonable. Even on the last night
College in all their areas of
responsibility. If this ability is
removed then its merits are shot to
pieces and nought that is said within
its pages would have any import
whatsoever. 'Wallowing in our own.
ego' is not a pastime in which Felix
indulges, it is merely proud of its
own ranking within the student
newspaper species.
A.D. Ham's RockSoc complaints
do score a few points, but only a
few. Poddy, the Music Editor, is
not famed for his tolerence on any
front, but he does at least have the
get up and go to provide a section
that appeals to many readers. Indie
and rave music reviews do make up
the majority of work covered only
the sound was a little dodgy and the because nobody from Rock Soc, or

guys were outperformed by the girls
with the exeption of Rodger (aka
Ed). The set was superb and the
music good. One thing I have
always wanted in Felix is previews
of events so that I can judge whether
something is worth going to. Not
reviews that tell me how bad it was
once I had seen it. In this case I did
go, I enjoyed the performance and
as far as I am aware, relatively few
tickets needed to be sold to sell out
on Friday and Saturday nights.
Certainly not enough to warrant the
ridiculous action of censoring Felix
in such a way. If the finances at
stake were of such great importance
then the Union, C C U s , and
societies involved in backing it were
idiots to have taken such a gamble.
As mentioned in Chris
Sweeting's letter of this week, Felix
does try to 'inform and encourage
student opinion'. However, if Felix
was to lie about the quality of such
an event, especially of Union
origin, then people would soon
learn to ignore such intellectually
offensive plugs. The independence
of Felix is there to comment and
inform students and staff about the
performance of the Union and
that scene, can be arsed to take the
initiative and start writing for Felix.
Something that is A L W A Y S
welcomed along with proof readers
(pedantic git). As final comments
on this particular debacle, adverts
on the whole are paid for, press
releases are usually so un-
informative as not to warrant entry
in their basic form. If you want to
publicise any event without
comment then submit a 'What's On'
entry or Small Ad.
Back now to M r Proctor. The
print unit has grown in size since
first formed by and for Felix. It has
steadily increased its productivity
and this has enabled work other
than Felix to be done. But it is still
an amateur body despite the two full
time professionals it employs (the
printer and typesetter) and as such
relies on the ethos of self help
wherever possible. The print unit
endeavours to print as much
material as possible for the Union
and its clubs and societies, an
immense task as I hope you are
aware when only one printer and
press is available on two and a half
to three days a week. The pressure
of work last year led to a massive
amount of overtime being built up
by Andy the printer and myself, far
too often I worked 100 hours a
week (in a normal week about 70
hours!), trying to catch up with
excess printing work. As a result I
often suffered severe exhaustion
and our printer almost resigned on
a number of occasions.
In view of the above I fully
respect, and lay no blame on, this
year's Print Unit Manager and Felix
Editor, Adam, for not learning to
print. Andy has again built up a
large amount of overtime due to
demand. The Union has a policy of
not paying overtime as wages and
forces time in lieu as the only
option. Andy needs time off and
thoroughly deserves it for his effort
and patience. This fact has meant
that he is likely to be working a
three day week for the the
forseeable future. Based on this
information try planning the
printing of Felix (2 to 2 Vi days) and
all the other work asked for
(Guildsheet, IndSoc News, Union
letterheads, invoices, business
cards, leaflets, posters, clubs and
societies publicity, etc etc). It just
can't be done. Also, although
booking things months in advance
helps it cannot always be
guaranteed due to any number of
unforeseen circumstances. People
do not turn up with artwork on
time, machines fail or external work
is booked that cannot be shifted to
another slot. If a slot is missed it can
be several months before another
one becomes available.
But what about the photocopier?
Last year we found out that the
servicing company had gone into
liquidation leaving us high and dry.
The machine soldiered on with
much time spent on it by myself and
Felix staff until mid November last
year. To fix it now will probably
cost in the region of £1000 and
whether this will be recouped,
including further regular servicing,
is doubtful. Perhaps the union and
C C U s would be prepared to
underwrite this operation. To date
we have worked in excess of 150
man hours on the problem and spent
in the region of £2000 in attempts
to renew this service to the student
body.
After noting the above
information that you so obviously
lack, M r Proctor et al, I conclude
the basic, but severe, problem is
ignorance of the situation. If you,
or anyone else for that matter, have
any complaints about Felix or the
Print Unit come into the office at
a sensible time (not when Felix is
in full swing, or when the Editor is
shattered after finishing it) and
discuss problems without biting
peoples heads off.

Manager 1990/91.
