21 February 1992 Felix 927 AIDS Week
Kate is a University of London
student and she is HIV positive. She
talks to Anita Anand candidly about
the moment she found out she had
been infected with the killer virus.
Kate is an alias used to protect the
identity of this courageous
undergraduate. The name is
fictitious but the story is tragically
true. Kate is in her youth but one
day she knows that she will die of
AIDS.
I don't know if you've met Kate. If
you're not sure, then let me
describe her to you. She makes
notably disgusting coffee. Her
lanky frame seems far too well
groomed for that of a London
student, her essays are late, and she
ate far too much over Christmas. In
most things she is totally
unremarkable. There is however
one thing that I forgot to mention
about Kate. She is 21 years old, and
she has been infected with the HIV
virus.
Can you imagine the first thing
I said when they told me that I had
the virus? It was so silly and
unprofound. All I could say again
and again was 'I've just bought a
ball dress. I'm going to a Ball on
Saturday and you're telling me that
I'm going to die. What gives you
the right to tell me that? I've just
bought a brand new dress!'
It is very hard for Kate to talk
about what she calls her
'blackness'. In a way it is almost
just as hard to hear what she says.
She is a young flaky student like
most of those milling around
London University.
Her bed is covered with teddy
bears. And yet she talks about her
illness, and she talks about death
with an authority that has no place
in the face of a promising young
woman of 21.
Information Fair
Tuesday 25th
11.00am-3.00pm in the JCR
Organised by Riverside Health
Authority. Health advisers from the
Genito-Urinary Clinic will be
present to offer advice on a wide
range of AIDS related topics,
including the HIV test and where it
is available, safer sex and how to
put a condom on correctly.
Question Time
Wednesday 26th
1.00pm in Civ Eng 201
A volunteer from Body Positive,
living with HIV, will speak about
her experience and answer
questions about the virus. Dr
Freedman, from Imperial College
Health Centre, will give medical
information about AIDS and HIV.
Throughout most of the interview
she was crying, holding a pillow
tightly to her chest rocking herself
from side to side like one of the
Romanian orphans the latest victims
of our five minute charity sprees.
She has those same orphan eyes too.
It is not very often that we see this
side of the horrific AIDS carnage.
There are those like Derek
Jarman who have the same infection
running through their veins but are
militant, defiant and strong, often
humourous about the virus. T wish
I could be like that too. But I can't.
I hate it! I don't want any of this and
I can't go through any of that stiff-
upper-lip crap. It hurts and it's
unfair. So bloody unfair!'
Kate found out relatively recently
that she has the HIV virus. She
admits that in time her perspective
may change but for now she says
'I'm terrified. Every day I wake up
scared and angry, but mostly so
frightened.'
Kate is reluctant to acknowledge
the courage it took for her to talk
to a newspaper. 'I'm no hero. For
God's sake I was all ready to chuck
it all in. Drop out of my course, run
away from home and find a dark
room and sit and wait for the AIDS
to catch me and eat me. My parents
helped me so much through that
nightmare. At first they were so
hurt by it all. They felt betrayed and
I felt as if I had betrayed them. But
they are strong for me. I suppose
they gave me life twice.'
Kate is receiving counselling and
her GP has been 'very kind and
