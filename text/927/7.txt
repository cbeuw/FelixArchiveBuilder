Tournament
Structure
All the 4-a-side games will take
place in the Volleyball Court over
two periods of 15 minutes each,
with every game supervised by a
referee. Since each team comprises
of 6 players, this allows there to be
2 substitutes (yes I did pass my CSE
maths!). During the game, the subs
can rotate as often as a team desires.
I expect approximately 16 teams
to enter the event. Thus the first
phase of the tournament will
involve the teams being split up into
groups of four. Within each group,
all the teams will play each other
once. 3 points shall be awarded for
a win, 1 for a draw and none for
a loss. The two teams with the most
points in each group will then
qualifier for a knock-out phase. If
two teams have a similar number of
points, the criteria used to
adjudicate which team goes forward
to the next round shall be the goal
difference, goals scored and goals
conceded.
For the knock-out stage, the draw
shall be made according to the
criteria shown in the table adjacent.
Eventually, this will lead to one
team winning the tournament. In
all, a total of 24 qualifying games
shall be played together with 7
knock-out games.
The fixtures shall be played
during the following times: Tuesday
l-2pm. Wednesday 4-6pm and
Thursday 4-5pm, with the first
games being played next week,
starting on Tuesday 25th February.
All the fixtures shall be finalised
immediately after the deadline for
entry. So it is vital that a member
from each team is present during the
draw. Every team will be notified
of all its fixtures in advance. As all
the results shall be published in
Felix, you can all see how your
club/society is getting on.
Well here it is. Finally we have
organised a competition within the
apathetic Imperial College.
Bemused! Then read on...
The OSC together with Felix
have organised the Imperial College
Indoor Soccer Tournament, a
competition open to any club or
society affiliated to the IC Union.
This is a 4-a-side football
tournament to be staged in the
Volleyball Court over the next few
weeks.
The winning club/society of the
competition will receive a trophy,
with the victorious players and
losing finalists each receiving
medals. There is also the
possibility, pending the outcome of
whether the Nat West Bank is
willing to sponsor the event, of cash
prizes. (Read next weeks issue of
Felix, to see if the winning
club/society can win £500.)
The body set up to organise the
competition is known as IC 1ST;
it's basically comprises of myself
and Gunny Dhadyalla, the OSC
Sports Officer. To enter the
tournament all you have to do is get
together a maximum of 6 friends
from your favourite society or club,
scribble their names onto a piece of
paper, and then give it to either
myself, here at Felix, or to Gunny.
Please note that there is a £5
entrance fee which the society/club
you are representing should, in
theory, pay for. Once you have
entered, you'll get a full list of the
rules for the tournament.
The deadline for entry is 5pm this
coming Monday, 24th February.
No entries will be allowed after this
time, no matter how big the bribe
(well actually...). Immediately after
the deadline, the draw shall be made
in the Felix office, after which the
resulting fixtures shall be
announced. It would be advisable
that O N E (no more please)
representative from each team
should be present at this time.
At the point of writing this article,
1 know of several teams who have
expressed a wish to enter the
competition, but which haven't yet
fulfilled the entrance requirements.
These include the following:
Islamic, Sikh, Whist and Board
Games, Greek, Lebanese, Sri
Lankan, Malaysian, and RSM. So
please could these clubs get their
acts together. Unfortunately, teams
such as the MSc Transport and MSc
Computing are not able to enter -
so you lot should try to hustle you
way into a club.
