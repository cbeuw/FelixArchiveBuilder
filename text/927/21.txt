Felix Felix 927 21 February 1992
Ooh-er missus, put that chicken
away and take your mind back to
the Guilds Dinner and Dance...Zoe
and Jeremy, Sam and Trigger.
Well, anybody wearing a shirt
absolutely covered in bright pink
elephants and wearing boxer shorts
covered in kisses doesn't deserve a
kiss from anyone. Not even our
wondrous Pres. type person. A
certain 'Michelle' was the recipient
of a barber shop-o-gram recently.
I am looking into who sponsored
this.
I must mention Mel here - Nick
Jones' girl-friend. She approached
Bob Symes after his speech and
asked for his autograph... on her
left breast! How disgusting, I hear
you cry, but what I feel is more
disgusting is the fact that he agreed.
Dirty old pervert or dithering old
fool? Whatever your opinion, he
made a good speaker from all
accounts and entertained the guests
with the good old helium filled
balloons.
Wild happenings have been afoot
Dear Marge
As for Valentines Day as a
whole, well I know of some people
who received messages, but to be
quite honest with you, the majority
of the messages seemed to be
contrived by certain ex-members of
the College and certain current
members of the Felix staff, by name
Paul Shanley and

in Fisher Hall this last week W i
Miss Sarah L e e , party-goer
extraordinaire and maker of
exceedingly good cakes, being
spotted snogging in the kitchen on
the third floor. The identity of this
person could never possibly be
revealed as this smear his character
beyond what could be decently
justified, and he may never be able
to show his face again. 'Fresher'
Bob, mind your laundry bills. The
main content of this bash seemed to
be Fleming's infamous Yellow
Venezuelan cocktail which can only
be watered down by the use of
Vodka, and preferably over-proof
blue Smirnoff. Apparently it was
held on behalf of the Lexham Flat
Ten Bachelors Black and White
Party. This appears to be made up
from most of the members of RCSU
including Martin, Massie, Rachael,
Phil and Steve. Any valid offers
from young ladies wishing for a
blind date with any of these healthy
Too Clever By Half
Too Clever by Half is the name of
the play showing today and
tomorrow in the Concert Hall here
in College, produced by the
amateur Stage Right Drama Group.
The group has links to Imperial
through stage manager Mike
Griffiths, who studied physics here

It's also AIDS awareness week
next week. There is an extra bar
quiz on Wednesday, to keep the
and graduated in 1972. The play by
the Russian Alexander Ostrovsky is
a satire about bureaucracy and a
clever schemer who achieves
success by turning his coat with
every wind. Tickets are £4.50
(students £3.50) and performances
start at 7.30pm
trivia buffs happy and International
Night on Friday within the Sherfield
Building. ,
In the JCR, there's a woolly

Friday. That's it for another week.
You now have seven days left to
sign up for a wonderful sabb post.
Cheers,
Steve Farrant,
ICU Hon Sec (Events).
young bachelors please apply via
the Felix office. May I just remind
you that you would have to be blind
to date any of them!
On a slightly more serious note,
it has been bought to our attention
that there are various chain letters
circulating the halls at the moment.
Some of these are exceedingly
threatening and should under no
circumstances be responded to. If
anybody receives a letter they have
two options. Firstly to just bin the
letter and forget about it, no matter
what is threatened, as there is no
way that such a letter can damage
either you or your possessions. The
second option is to bring them into
the Felix office and drop them in the
Dear Marge pigeon hole. If I can
find out who is responsible for
them, I will ensure that their lives
are made terminally miserable. If
those of you who are guilty of this
crime are reading this then I suggest
you stop now. This statement is not
a cheap threat but a statement of fact
and already there are indications of
your identity. It is only a matter of
time before you get caught. It is in
fact against the law to send chain
letters and you may find yourselves
facing legal proceedings if this
continues.
