Feature Felix 927 21 February 1992
Remember all those dead bodies
around the college a few weeks
ago? For those of you that didn't
attend the great event, this is what
you missed out on:
14 teams (including three from
Cambridge) left Beit Quad on
Saturday morning for their journeys
around a rather oversized Cluedo
board; London. In the good old rag
tradition the found some quite
silly/mad going's on. Penguin, the
Rag Chairman, played billiards
against the Grim Reaper in the
middle of Trafalgar Square.
Needless to say, the police got
somewhat worried about this and
almost had them removed, but after
being convinced that it was all in a
good cause, chose to ignore them.
The little dagger turned out to be
Next Saturday is 29th February
is called Leap Day and that's
exactly what's happening.
It's the culmination of a large
series of events that have been
occurring at universities up and
down the country for the last month
or so, to raise vast sums of money
for Oxfam. The main event that
most universities have been
participating in has been a
sponsored 1,000 mile leap frog,
with each university contributing a
couple of miles or so.
It's on the leap frog theme that
Oxfam have been concentrating.
Their mascot for this promotion is
Leap Frog, springy badges of
whom have been on sale and it's on
the same theme that all of the leap
day's events have been planned.
On the Saturday morning in
Battersea Park, just the other side
of the Thames, there will be the
culmination of the fundraising done
so far. Various things are already
planned, including a bouncy castle
(in the shape of Leap Frog) for the
a seven foot sword, we allowed a
bit of artistic license there. Poddy
was kicked out of the pub he was
supposed to be marshalling in and
proceeded to spook unsuspecting
tourists anywhere near Piccadilly
Circus.
Spanner and Bolt starred on the
day for a two hour performance as
did the Theta bearers minus Theta
(the latter indisposed, affected by a
Welsh parasite). 1 hope that
everybody involved had a great
day. We raised £1,084, which was
unfortunately not enough to win the
computer that Winged Fellowship
had on offer. A small consolation,
however came from the Hard Rock
Cafe, who spontaneously gave us
some merchandise as prizes. The
top collector was Tamsin 'Sex on
kiddies and the last of the 1,000
miles of leap frogs which is being
planned and run by IC Rag. We
shall be needing all the help that we
can get, so if you're going to be free
for the morning come up to the.rag
office one lunch time and we'll tell
you how you can take part.
In the afternoon it's off down the
pub and seeing as if you're a good
student you'll be there anyway, this
bit shouldn't be too difficult. The
second part of the day is being run
in conjunction with the Firkin Pubs.
Students and others are being
encouraged to go down to their
local Firkin pub before the day and
sign up for the sponsored leap. Each
person will be sponsored for a
distance that they can leapfrog
between 1.00 and 5.00pm on the
day. The leapfrogging will be done
in (or just outside) each pub, with
the pub that raises the most money
in that time being given a large
alcohol prize for all that have spent
the afternoon in the pub.
If you have a moments break
legs' Braisher who collected £150.
The winners of the game were a
team from Cambridge (shame on
you IQ.with the top IC team
dropping hints that the marking was
unfair (shame on you top team).
The big party that Winged
Fellowship put on for all the
collectors from all the Rags that
came down, was a big success
except for the fact that Ents double
booked. Ents kindly allowed us to
join the stormin' disco they already
had going.
Finally, thanks to everyone
involved, and if anybody is
interested, whether involved in the
day or not, STOIC have a short
video of the event so go up and have
a look.

between all your leaping on the day,
then you can sample the special leap
frog beer that the Firkin pubs have
been brewing for the occasion. It is
likely that by the time that this issue
is distributed the beer will already
be on sale, so go and by a pint.
Needless to say, all of the proceeds
from the beer are also going to
Oxfam.
Lastly, even as you read this,
plans are afoot for a large press
covered event to precede and
publicise the day. If all goes to plan
then next Friday, in the early
evening, members of IC Rag will
be playing a large game of human
leap frog draughts, probably against
another college. We can't let you
know any more about this at the
present because we haven't yet got
permission, and would not want
upset the people we may be asking.
Hopefully all will be revealed in
next weeks issue.
Again, if you want to help with
this then come up to the Rag office
any lunchtime.
BIBIC
Last weekend students from
Imperial College collected £804.59
for BIBIC, the British Institute for
Brain Injured Children. Various
other Rags came down including
D . U . C . K . (Durham Uni Charity
weeK), who were only able to come
down because individuals
associated with IC Rag were able
to put them up for the night (Hyde
Park Relay were using the crash
space in the Southside gym). Well
done to all concerned in collecting
both coins and Duckies.
After Oxfam's Leap Day (see
relevant article), the next collection
is for M E N C A P (Mentally
Handicapped) on Wednesday 4th
March. It will be collecting how we
know best, in the City of London
itself, as well as all of the mainline
stations and underground stations.
If interested come up to the new
Rag/Ents office any lunchtime, or
to the Rag meeting on Fridays.
Onwards!
As the term moves further on, so
I.C. Rag moves further afield and
tomorrow students from Imperial
hit the usually picturesque and
tranquil cathedral town of Bath.
Joining with Oxford Rag, the
collectors will be raising as much
as possible for UNICEF (United
Nations Children's Fund). The
places have already been filled, but
there will be more Rag Raids next
term.
