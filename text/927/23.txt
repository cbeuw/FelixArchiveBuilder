Access Rape Crisis
Administrators at Goldsmith's
College have already allocated all
the £123,000 of Access Funds given
to them by the Government, leaving
nothing for students who get into
difficulties later in the year.
Goldsmith's College Student Union
are reported to be angry about the
college's irresponsibility as well as
the manner in which the college
'dumped' the problem in the'
Union's doorstep. The college
claims it made the correct decision
in view of the large numbers of
applicants earlier in the year.

London)
PCL Alter
The Polytechnic of Central London
(PCL) is applying to the Privy
Council to change its name to the
'University of Westminster.' If the
parliamentary bill on education goes
through, then P C L will become a
University from the beginning of
the next academic year. (McGarel,
PCL)
Cheap
Eight polytechnics in the country
have been given permission to
implement two year degrees. The
new Government scheme aims to
increase the numbers of students
and give better access to mature
students. Critics of the scheme have
labelled them as 'degrees on the
cheap,' but a spokesperson from the
Polytechnics and Colleges Funding
Council told the London Student
that the courses were not short
degrees but full three year courses
compacted into two years. (London

St M Rag
St. Mary's rag week is starting on
Monday 24th February. The main
event will be the Beer Festival on
Saturday 29th at Wilson House, but
it will also include a Karaoke
session on Monday, a Slave
Auction on Tuesday and on
Wednesday a Float will circulate
London. There will be a Band Night
on Friday and on Sunday Martin
Taylor the Hypnotist will be
performing. All proceeds from the
week will be going to the
Paddington Green Childrens' Ward
and the Antony Nolan Bone
Marrow Trust. More information
about the week can be obtained
from St. Mary's Student Union on
internal 23 042, extension 5196.
One in ten female students in British
Universities have been raped or
experienced 'date rape,' a survey
has revealed. Siwan Hayward, part
of Cambridge University Students'
Union Welfare, who helped
organise the study, said that the
results were provisional but
mirrored by surveys in the USA and
by the London Rape Crisis. The full
results of the survey are expected
on March 11th.
Anyone who has been sexually
assaulted can contact Stefano Ruis,
Union Welfare Advisor, in the
Union Office or Don Adlington,
student Counsellor, for confidential
advice and counselling. London
Rape Crisis has a counselling
phoneline on 071 837 1600.
Overcharged
Many students are being
encouraged to pay worthless
National Insurance contributions
this year. A letter from the
Department of Social Security has
been sent to nearly 3.5 million
people who have not made
sufficient contributions from their
wages to count towards a pension.
The letter does not demand
payment, but says that unless the
shortfall is paid, any money
collected so far that year will be
discounted. Many will not benefit
from paying the shortfall as the
contribution will only count towards
the basic pension, or widow's
pension for a married man, but not
towards unemployment benefit,
sickness benefit, invalidity benefit,
maternity allowance or state
earnings related pensions.
Funds Up
Imperial College stands to gain a
large increase in its budget from
proposed changes in the methods of
funding Universities. Figures
released by the University Funding
Council (UFC) last Monday mean
that research funding will increase
by 11 %, but it will be spread more
selectively between what the U F C
describes as 'research dominated'
institutions. This compares with the
8.5% rise in funding for
Universities admitting greater
numbers of students, which is the
traditional method of higher
education funding.
This has increased speculation
that Universities will be split into
a two tier system of teaching and
research, with a US-style graduate
school system developing. The
U F C has denied this to iCNN,
saying that 'we are not forcing any
one to do anything, there will be a
lot of people in the middle'. This
has been apparently contradicted by
Professor Graeme Davis, U F C
Chairman, who told the national
media that teaching and research
were 'incompatible'.
Roger Frost, Press officer at the
Department of Education, said that
It may not be necessary to pay a
missing year, as to qualify for a
basic pension there only need to be
44 years of full contributions for
women and 49 for men. This allows
for five missed working years from
April 6th on your 16th birthday to
April 5th before your retirement
age. A basic pension will still be
given if you miss more years, but
will be reduced appropriately.
Credit years are also available in
cases of unemployment or
invalidity. You may not gain
anything by paying the extra
contribution whilst at College.
If you are unsure, contributions
may be paid up to six years in
arrears, so a shortfall last year
(1990-91) may be made up as late
as April 5th 1997.
while the U F C were autonomous of
Government the changes were
trying 'to reward places of the
greatest excellence and value for
money.'
Imperial College stands to gain a
significant amount from this change
and has increased the number of
undergraduates by 1.7% last year,
compared to a national increase of
6%. The number of postgraduate
students in Imperial increased by
9.7% in the past year. Postgraduate
students receive higher funding
from U F C . The idea of creating an
exclusively research institution is
not being considered by Imperial
College Planning Department, and
a source in the admissions
department said that undergraduate
numbers were being increased
within the 'boundary of targets', but
could not say what the targets were.
The proposed changes would
mean a cut of 1.5% in funding per
student for educational institutes,
and student numbers are expected
to increase so fast that they will
outweigh increases in funding.
Details of institutions that will
benefit are to be released in two
weeks time.
Poll Tax
Westminster City Council have
overcharged hundreds of IC
students for poll tax this week by
billing them the full £36. The
students, who live in the Princes
Gardens Halls of Residence, have
received half year poll tax bills of
£18, which equates to a full year
charge of £36. Students should only
pay 20% of the full contribution,
which is about £ 3 .
College Finance Manager,
Malcolm Aldridge, has written to
Westminster Council to complain
about the blunder and to request re-
billing. He told Felix this week that
students should write individually to
Westminster Council to demand a
correction to .their bills. The address
is Community Charge Enquiries,
City Hall, Victoria Street, SW1.
The announced poll tax figure for
next year is the same as that for last
year. Increases in costs due to
inflation have been absorbed by
savings made in cutting central costs
and from £5 million saved by
compulsory competitive tendering.
Extra spending in the district
includes £2 million on footways and
£ 1 . 4 million on children and
community care services.
Roadshow
The Terrence Higgins Trust will be
sending a roadshow to Imperial
College as part of AIDS awareness
week. The roadshow will be held
in the foyer of the Sherfield
Building and will distribute
information on the services that the
Terrence Higgins Trust provides.
This week also saw the
announcement of the payment of
£12 million to people infected the
with HIV virus through blood
transfusions.
Bust Up
The College management and
Trade Unions have run into
difficulties in their attempts to draw
up a settlement on the recent
security and messenger dispute.
The dispute arose over college plans
to privatise security, messenger and
car parking services at the college,
and was thought to have been
resolved when the Rector, Sir Eric
Ash, decided to award the contract
in-house. Discussions then began on
a detailed contract, involving
overtime reduction and new shift
patterns. These talks are now in
deadlock, and an announcement is
expected next week.
