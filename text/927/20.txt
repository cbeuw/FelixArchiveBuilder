Betty Blue
Yes, the classic amour fou film in
the 80s is back again. However, la
version integrale, re-cut by director
Jean-Jacques Beineix, contains an
hour of previously unseen footage,
which make up to a total running
time of three hours!
No, not an extra hour of bonking
scenes. Nevertheless, these extra
scenes are essential in accounting
for Betty's being driven into
insanity.
Betty (Beatrice Dalle) walks into
Zorg's (Jean-Hughes Anglade) life
by bonking every night and moving
into his place by the sea, where he
is supposed to paint all the
bungalows as a living. One day,
Betty discovers Zorg's notebooks
containing his works, which he
thinks are nothing; whereas Betty
is so impressed that she reckons
they should be published and Zorg
should concentrate on writing. To
get Zorg out of his boring life, she
burns his house down and they have
to flee to Paris. From then on. their
adventure moves on to some small
province, in which most of the
scenes of the unseen footage take
place, while Betty's hopes become
shattered because of the refusal
letters from publishers and her
failing to give Zorg a baby. Out of
despair. Betty plucks one of her
eyes out...
If you have seen the edited
version before and are not
convinced about Betty's self-
destruction, the unseen footage
contains trivial, but important
scenes that build up the tragedy, and
some gags as well. Highlights
include Dominique Pinon's (the
clown from Delicatessen) cameo as
a drug dealer. There is also the
funny bit about the mattress that
their friend's dead mother sleeps in
before. What's surprising to
someone that has seen it many times
before is the freshness contained in
Betty and Zorg's characters, and the
people around them, and eventually
the film itself.
And. for those who had missed
it when it was first released, Betty
Blue is certainly the film with
passion. Ever so moving. Ever so
wonderful.

The Cutting
This play is about Judith and Alex.
Judith is on remand, Alex is a
psychiatrist assigned to the task of
getting Judith to talk. She is
suspected of murdering her mother
(and cutting her up and feeding her
to the birds) but for seven months
she has been silent. The Cutting, by
Maureen O'Brien, looks at the
relationship that develops between
them.
It looks at silence, at speech and
at how and why we use each of
these things. The acting, by Paul
Freeman and Sian Thomas is
excellent. The period when Judith
is not talking is fascinating, seeing
her act with her eyes alone. It's a
good idea to sit in the seats on the
longer side of the, excellent, set
otherwise you may miss that, and
whilst mentioning the seats, be
prepared for someone sitting on
your feet and for you to be sitting
on someone else's.
The language in the play is
wonderful and Judith's description
of being in love is enchanting. It is
rare to find a play where you sit and
listen to the words thinking, 'this is
so true'. That, amongst many other
qualities makes this play a brilliant
piece of theatre. Even if the
storyline does not grab you, the
subtlety and truth in the descriptions
of feelings and experiences will.

I didn't think 'this is so true' at
all actually, but then Darwen is
much more mentally stable than me.
I thought it was a black comedy. I
found it funny, and captivating; or
even captivating and funny. Well
worth a visit, if plays are your
thing. I'm off back to my music
pages, personally.

manager? He loves only money and
himself. Or should she comply with
the wishes of her ex-boyfriend's
aristocratic family who are all very
strange and for different reasons
want her to have the baby? And
then there's Frank, Mark's minder,
who's got a crush on Ivy, but
unfortunately he is stupid and
socially not acceptable. Anyway,
Ivy get's 'modelnapped' by the
crazed aristocrats. When Frank
comes to rescue her he is put to
sleep with a spiked drink and
shipped to Africa, from whence he
later returns in a sort of Rambo
outfit.
This and much more of the kind
in Valdorama at the Latchmere
Theatre. And get this, it's all in
verse! Now is that a great tale of
love and power, the revival of good
theatrical traditions—or it just a
right load of bollocks?

From a Jack
to a King
From a Jack to a King is currently
playing at The Boulevard Theatre.
They are obviously hoping for a
transfer to a bigger, more flashy
venue. I hope they don't get it, this
show doesn't deserve it.
If you've seen Return to the
Forbidden Planet you'll know the
general idea of Bob Carlton's 'Rock
and Roll Musical'. Take some
Shakespeare quotes, wrapped
around a rough plot (in this case
Macbeth), some safely popular 60s
and 70s songs and here you have it.
Apparently it works in Forbidden
Planet (I admit - I haven't seen it)
but sadly not in From a Jack to a
King. What you get is a
dissappointing night out and
certainly a waste of your money.
It wasn't funny and it wasn't
original. Soap fans may be
interested to see Sue from
Brookside in it, but don't let that be
a reason for going, you'd regret it.
The show opens, and closes, with
a rendition of 'Money (that's what
I want)'; don't give them your's.
