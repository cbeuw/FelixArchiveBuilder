Security
Slammed
A room in Southside Halls was
forcibly entered last Friday and a
large amount of electronic
equipment, including a hi-fi system
and a camera, were stolen. Forensic
tests carried out by police officers
on Monday uncovered no evidence
as to the identity of the criminals.
Dr John Hassard, warden of
Selkirk and Tizard Halls, told
Imperial College News Network
(iCNN) that the theft was 'the latest
in a long line of losses' not just from
rooms but from common areas in
Southside as well. Dr Hassard also
queried the suitability of the new
swipe card system being installed
around college, even though he
does hope that the system will be
a success. He quotes sources at
Sabre Access Control Systems Ltd,
the manufacturers of the system, as
saying that individual cards will
often become inoperable. This may
lead to attempts to ensure access,
such as propping doors open. But
Keith Reynolds, IC chief security
officer, is sure that any problems
will only be minor teething
problems and procedures to rectify
problems will be quick and simple.
Mr Reynolds said that he had
installed similar systems in the past
and in 18 months, with 4000 cards,
only 3 cards went wrong. Together
with increased patrols to make
College security forces more visible
and the possibility of Close Circuit
Television cameras in halls, M r
Reynolds said that the swipe system
should go a long way to increasing
college security. He said that the
system had been 'put in with a lot
of thought to try and make life
simple for everyone.'(iCNN)
Election Update
No candidates have put their names
up for the posts of President and
Deputy President of the Union for
the 1992 sabbatical elections, except
New Election. The three options for
the post of Felix Editor and Print

Richard Eyers and Mr Jones is
proposed by Sarah Harland, from

The two Honorary Secretary
(Events) candidates so far are Nick
Allen, proposed by Laurie
McNamee, and New Election. The
New Election campaign is usually
organised by the current Honorary
Secretary, in this case Steve
Farrant, though the Imperial
College News Network (iCNN)
may run a campaign based on a
previous slogan, 'can you think of
a better reason to vote New
Election'?,' accompanied by a
photograph of the current sabbatical
officers.
Guidelines for the coverage of the
election by i C N N are freely
available from the Felix Office and
are posted on the Union notice
board outside the Union Office.
Declan Curry, i C N N election
media co-ordinator, said that the
guidelines were merely to help
candidates to plan their campaign to
maximum effect.
Candidate's manifestoes will be
published in Felix next Friday, the
day that sabbatical papers come
down. Deadline for acceptance of
manifestoes is this Monday.
STOIC, the television service, will
also be producing campaign videos
for candidates. (iCNN)
