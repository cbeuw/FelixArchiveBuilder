AIDS Week Felix 927 21 February 1992
In the 1st year of their Clinical
course at Mary's all medical
students spend a week on a nursing
attachment, last September I found
myself on one of the two wards at
St Mary's which specialise in caring
for HIV+ve patients. On the whole
most medical students spend little
time with these patients except for
the odd ward round, I am very glad
that I had the opportunity to spend
a week there.
Day 1—What do I say to these
people?
How does HIV affect their lives?
Will they realise how unsure I
am?
I met the Ward Sister that
morning and she suggested that I go
and see two of the patients who she
checked were willing to talk to me.
That morning I managed to
overcome some of my inhibitions
and worries about HIV + ve patients
and began to learn how very varied
the patients can be.
Not every patient knows or has
accepted their diagnosis, while
others are angry, depressed, or have
come to terms with it and are keen
to talk. Almost all the patients I
spoke to during the week are
incredibly well informed about
HIV, AIDS and all the latest
treatments, they want to know why,
when and how they will be treated
and certainly will not just leave it
to the Medical Profession to do
what is best!
During the week I also met the
partners and sometimes the family
of many of the patients, they may
know different amounts about the
diagnosis so confidentiality is very
important. The partners are often
involved in much of the caring for
a patient.
Whilst some of the patients are
seriously ill and require a high
degree of nursing care, many of the
patients are young, very
independent and able to look after
themselves, therefore unlike
working on many other wards the
nursing care required is often not
so much washing and feeding, but
has a large Psychosocial content and
complex Drug rounds. In addition
the nurses work with Community
The Terrence Higgins Trust
There are a
number of
voluntary groups
who help AIDS
victims, as well
as sexual
problems in
general.
The Terrence Higgins Trust was
founded in 1982 and is today the
leading AIDS charity in the U K ,
providing practical support, help,
counselling and advice for anyone
with or concerned about AIDS or
HIV infection. It involves over 800
people, the vast majority of whom
are volunteers, who provide
services available to anyone
concerned about AIDS, A R C
(AIDS Related Complex) and HIV.
The Trust set up their AIDS
helpline in February 1984, the first
one to be established in the U K . It
now runs from 3pm to 10pm every
day including weekends offering
telephone counselling support and
information. Helpline counsellors
are skilled and trained people who
deal with up to 1,500 calls every
month. A priority line is available
so that people with AIDS, ARC and
HIV can speak to a counsellor
immediately. Lawyers are available
for advice and information on the
Legal Helpline every Wednesday
evening at 7pm until 10pm. The
Legal Advice Service has over 60
lawyers giving information and
undertakes casework on a whole
range of AIDS, A R C and HIV
issues.
The Welfare Rights Service
offers advice to people with AIDS,
A R C and HIV on subjects such as
Social Security, debt and
entitlement to service from Local
Authorities. The service is available
to refer clients to the most
appropriate agency to deal
confidentially with their problems.
The service is also able to provide
expert technical information for
advice and support workers from
other agencies. For example Social
Security case law and the
monitoring of good practice in the
DHSS. It also specialises in the
decision and implementation of
training packages for advice and
care agencies.
The Trust provides a number of
different counselling and support
services to both men and women.
They are available to people who
have AIDS, A R C and HIV and to
those caring for them. The services
are free and strictly confidential and
provided by trained and
experienced counsellors.
The Terrence Higgins Trust
offers health education in the form
of speakers, conferences and a
roadshow, giving advice and
