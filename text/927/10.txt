AIDS Week Felix 927 21 February 1992
Continued from page 9.
very helpful. I suppose that is
because she is young.' Kate
received counselling before she was
even given the blood test at the STD
clinic. 'They warned me about all
the down-sides to the test and all the
up-sides too. They were really
honest. They told me that if I had
the test done and it was negative
then I wouldn't have to worry
anymore. If I tested positive, then
I could quickly get drugs and
counselling to help me get in control
of things and maybe keep healthier
for longer. But the downsides were
frightening and I very nearly bottled
out. I was warned about the
prejudice and the disruption, and
the ignorance and hatred I may have
to face if I was tested positive.
But the bloke I had been with had
been tested positive and I had to
know. I couldn't live with the
uncertainty. I had the test and I was
positive.'
Kate is revising for her finals, but
she is remarkably calm about them.
'Everything takes on a different
perspective. I didn't want to chuck
my degree in. That would have
been three years wasted and there
has been more than enough waste
in my life already. You've just got
to get on the best you can. It's the
way I keep my sanity I suppose.'
For the same reasons that she
remains anonymous for this
interview, Kate has also told only
her closest friends and one of her
tutors that she is HIV positive.
T don't want to be treated like a
leper. I'm used to having lots of
people around me. And there is no
use pretending that people, friends
and such would be able to handle
it. Some people's families can't
even take it.
I know about one mother whose
daughter is HIV positive too. Her
mother makes her book into a Bed
and Breakfast every time she has
her period! I don't want that shit.
I want to shake peoples' hands
without seeing fear and hatred in
their eyes. I demand that as my
right as a human being.'
When asked if she owes it to
those she knows to tell them that she
is infected, she reacts
contemptuously.
T don't owe them a damn thing!
I'm not putting anyone in any
danger, and I will not give up my
right to hold hands because of
ignorance and evil bigotry. HIV is
not skin deep. My skin holds the
virus in. Any one who touches me,
who shakes my hand, is completely
safe. My skin is their protection. It
is also my prison.'
Kate refuses to talk about how she
contracted the illness.
'That's my personal life, and it
is private. But I want people to
know that I am heterosexual, and
. I have never injected drugs in my
life. And I don't sleep around
either. It was one mistake. God!
Don't I sound like an awful T V
advert. But it's true. I didn't
deserve this. No one deserves this
no matter what they've done.'
What do you think sex is for? Pure
fun and enjoyment? A way of
demonstrating love? Strictly for the
production of children? Something
to laugh and brag about amongst
friends? Healthy exercise?,Dirty
fun? Annoying the neighbours?
Testing the bed springs? Passing the
(permissiveness makes more
orgasms but we miss out on old-
style restricted courtship, kisses and
looks that vagina-bent, with-it males
now think is sloppy); sleeping
together without intercourse.
In fact HIV could provide a
means of encouraging people to
Kate is one of the most
courageous people I have ever met.
It is a naive observation to make,
but nevertheless it is important that
it be made. Kate does not look any
different to most people you would
sit next to in a lecture theatre. HIV
is a cruel and deceptive illness.
Those who have it may not even
know it unless they have been tested
or when it is too late, and they have
contracted full blown AIDS. It is a
curse of our day and a curse that
nobody deserves.
'I'm doing this interview today
only for one reason. People must
know that it does happen around
them, very close to them. There is
just no way of telling how many of
your own friends are carrying the
infection. After all if they are like
me, they will not tell you. Don't be
stupid and take risks. AIDS doesn't
care if you are a student, a drug
addict or a bank manager. Use safe
sex and enjoy your life. It is such
a precious thing and we take it
completely for granted.'
What Kate claims as her right is
anyone's sincere privilege. I am
proud to shake this brave lady by
the hand.

time before a cigarette?
Experimenting with new positions?
Whispering about behind the bike
sheds? Playing with hamsters?
Letting off steam? Quelling your
urges? An overrated pastime?
Whatever your personal views, we
can all agree that it should be a life-
enhancing experience, not a
potentially life-destroying one.
Non-Penetrative Sex
If you attended sex education
lessons at school the chances are the
main thrust of the course was
towards teaching about
reproduction - how to do it and how
to stop it - and therefore penetrative
sex is promoted as 'the norm'. In
fact after a straw poll asking
students 'what type of sex would
you think of if I said I had sex last
night?', everyone answered
'penetrative sex'. This needn't be
the case, there are many varied
methods of safer sex which are
commonly practised which don't
involve penetration.
Some other things are 'real sex'
too which people also need for a
fulfilling relationship. For example;
being together in a situation of
pleasure, or of danger, or just of
rest, touching, holding hands
broaden their sexual horizons, not
just relying on penetration as the
goal of sexual pleasure. If you're
interested in research, Alex
Comfort's 'The Joy of Sex'
describes many types of non-
penetrative sex which are worth
trying - that should keep you going
for a short while!
Toys
Don't forget that using toys can
heighten sexual enjoyment and are
totally safe as long as you don't
share them. For example; dildos,
vibrators, Chinese balls, rubber
dolls, artificial vaginas The list
goes on and on as does the pleasure.
Oral Sex
Of slightly higher risk of infection
is oral sex, the risk can be removed
by using a condom or dental dam.
Dental dams are relatively rare in
this country but are available in
some local chemists, they are
basically a flavoured square of
rubber and are used by placing over
the area to be licked. A very
interesting study on the art of oral
sex for women can be found in
'How to drive your man wild in
bed' by Graham Masterton.
Similarly a study for men is found
