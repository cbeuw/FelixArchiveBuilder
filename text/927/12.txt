How is AIDS Transmitted?
When AIDS was first identified in
the USA, all the people affected
seemed to be homosexual or
bisexual. However, shortly
afterwards the disease was also
discovered among heterosexual
injected drug users. Before long this
heterosexual trend was confirmed
with the diagnosis of AIDS among
them and women who did not inject
drugs. It was also diagnosed among
recipients of blood products such as
haemophiliacs.
It soon became apparent that
there was a considerable

sanitisers? The
virus itself is far
less infectious
than the hysteria
surrounding it
heterosexual AIDS problem in
Africa and that AIDS clearly was
not a new disease at all. It seemed
to have been in Central Africa for
at least fifteen years and perhaps
many more.
Although AIDS first appeared in
different groups of people in
different countries, HIV is
invariably transmitted in a similar
way, through the transfer of
infected body fluids.
HIV has been found in semen,
tears, breast milk, vaginal
secretions and blood. The means by
which HIV is passed on, or
'transmitted', from an infected
person to an uninfected person are
therefore very limited and require
a degree of intimate contact.
• Unprotected sex. Penetrative
sex between men and women or
men and men, both vaginal and anal
can lead to transmission of HIV.
Anal sex is associated with the
highest risk. The presence of other
sexually transmitted disease, such
as genital ulcers, may also increase
the possibility of transmission.
Unprotected oral sex, and sexual
contact between women is
associated with a lower risk of
transmission.
• Infected blood and blood
products. HIV transmission via this
route has now been virtually
eliminated in industrialised
countries through routine screening
of donated blood. Most developing
countries are now also improving
their screening of blood for HIV.
• Re-use of needles or syringes
can lead to the exchange of small
quantities of blood, leading to
transmission of the virus from one
person to the next. Injecting drug
users who share 'works' can
transmit the virus in this way. Re-
using needles in a medical setting,
which still occurs in some less
developed countries, could also lead
to transmission.
It is possible for HIV to be
transmitted if the blood of an
infected person gets through a break
in the skin of another.
• From mother to child
(prenatal transmission). Estimates
are that around one in four children
born to mothers with HIV infection
will themselves be infected with
HIV. There is also a slight chance
of infection via breast milk.
HIV cannot be transmitted through:
• Coughing
• Sneezing
• Sharing a toilet seat
• Mosquitoes and other insects
• Sharing a drinking fountain
• Eating food prepared by
someone who has HIV
• Showers and swimming pools
• Sweat, tears and saliva
• Animals and pets
With regard to social contact, it is
the person with AIDS who may be
in danger. They are more
susceptible to infections such as
colds, flu, measles or chicken-pox,
with serious consequences due to
their deficient immune system.
Drugs & HIV
People who inject drugs are not
only at risk of HIV infection from
sexual contact, but also from the
sharing of infected injecting
equipment. Sharing 'works' is the
surest way of transmitting HIV, as
infected blood can be injected
directly into the bloodstream of an
uninfected person. The total for
known HIV positive people through
injecting drugs in the U K is 2179
(Sept '91), with 223 cases of AIDS
and 120 deaths.
Users of injecting drugs can
protect themselves by looking at a
range of options for drug use other
than injecting. There is a growing
range of agencies which can
provide help and advice on
changing their pattern of drug use.
Drug users who continue to inject
drugs can protect themselves by
never sharing equipment (eg

needles, syringes or spoons). Sterile
equipment is available from needle
exchange schemes and from a
growing number of high street
pharmacies. Injecting with sterile
works or a set kept strictly for use
by one person offers the best
protection for those who continue
to inject. If equipment is not shared,
it cannot spread HIV. However, if
sterile or individual equipment is
not available the next best thing is
to clean equipment using
disinfectant. This may offer some
protection, although it is difficult to
disinfect plastic and is no substitute
for sterile works. Washing
equipment in water is not sufficient.
Sexual partners of drug injectors,
who do not themselves inject, risk
infection through unsafe sexual
activities with their drug injecting
partners.
There are four points to consider
in order to stay healthy:
1. Stop sharing. Always try to get
your own set of works. Find a local
syringe exchange. Use a clean set
of works for every fix. Use your
own spoon for cooking up. Use
clean water to mix with the gear.
Dispose of used works safely.
2. If you have to share, clean
your works. Clean used equipment
immediately it is last used. Separate
needle, barrel and plunger and clean
them in hot tap water and household
detergent. Remove all traces of
blood. Rinse the works thoroughly
with clean water. Do the same with
any spoons etc.
3. Stop fixing. There are lots of
alternative ways of taking any drug
which do not involve fixing or skin-
popping: smoking or snorting
heroin, snorting speed, dropping
pills, freebasing coke, oral
substitutes like methadone.
4. Stop using. Find a local drugs
agency to give advice on self-help
methods of coming off or other
available treatment options. Join a
support group. Consider a re-hab
programme.
The best way to protect yourself
from HIV and to stay healthy is not
to take drugs at all. If you require

1. You pick up a girl who's got a
pack of condoms. Are you:
a) insulted
b) relieved
c) excited she's carrying a
ten-pack
2. Your partner asks you to perform
a sexual act that might involve
blood passing between you. Do
you:
a) lie back and think of England
b) refuse point blank because of
the risk of HIV infection
c) say 'not tonight, darling. I've
got a headache"
matter what his sexual preferences
might be
c) decide to tell your friend
6. The best looking boy in town
takes you out in his sports car and
asks you to stay the night at his
place. You know that he never uses
condoms. Do you:
a) have another spritzer and say
'Let's go'
b) say no, unless he'll buy some
condoms from the machine in the
gents
c) say: ' O K . but you'll have to
sleep on the sofa'
Questionnaire
3. You find out that your best friend
is HIV positive. When you meet
them in the street, do you:
a) announce that your friendship
is ended and turn your back on them
forever
b) tell them that you want to help
in any way you can because a friend
is for life
c) cross over the road because
you're scared your friend might
breathe on you
4. Your ex-boyfriend or girlfriend
tells you that they've been to the
STD clinic and has gonorrhea. Do
you:
a) tell them that it's their
problem, not yours
b) Call the clinic and make an
appointment as soon as possible
c) ask if you can have some of
their medicine
5. You've always liked your
friend's big brother. He's tall, good
looking and athletic. One day you
see him kissing with another boy at
a bus stop. Do you:
a) decide you don't like him any
more
b) decide you still like him no
RESULTS
Mostly a) answers: You have a very
serious attitude problem. You
should read all the information you
can about sex and sexuality very
carefully arid think about your
answers again. Your recklessness
could cost you your life.
Mostly b) answers: You have
obviously understood the dangers
involved in casual sex without
protection, and you have a mature
attitude towards other people's
sexual preferences. Don't be afraid
to voice your opinions.
Mostly c) answers: Your heart is
in the right place but you are still
confused. This means that you are
still at risk. You must be more
careful in your attitude towards life
and re-think your attitudes to sex
and sexuality.
