The Stairs
- Woman Gone &
Say Goodbye
This is great, this is wonderful. At
last a record I like. A sort of cross
between The Doors, and I mean the
early stuff before Jim spent his
entire life pissed, and The
Thirteenth Floor Elevators. Perhaps
the most hacky, 'right on', way to
describe them is as a '60s retro-
group' but I won't. They may sound
like The Rolling Stones at times,
even, perish the thought The Beatles
but I for one won't hold it against
them. This is more like it, I've had
enough of these rock and roll people
playing with themselves in public,
posing with their guitars as if they
are some sort of demi-gods. Give
me a record you can get down and
dance to any day of the week, and
here it is. Groovy.
Pebbles.
World of Twist
- Camden Palace
I wasn't going to review this. I was
just going to go along and groove
to the grooviness. But I've
knackered my knee, so I wasn't
feeling much like dancing to the
danciness, and I was quite drunk,
so not particularly coordinated for
boogie-ing to the booginess. And I
must say that they did play some
particularly good songs, the KLF's
America-What Time Is Love? in
particular can not go unmentioned,
because it's too cool for words. I'm
going to buy it. Yes, that good.
~ World Of Twist. Oh Yes. No
stage presence at all but they do
have some good songs... Sons Of
The Stage, Lose My Way, Sweets
and the encore She's A Rainbow are
all really great songs, if a little on
the baggy side. I've told you all this
before, of course. They also have
a couple of stinkers in the set as
well, but I'm going to skim over
them. I don't want to get a
reputation as a miserable
perfectionist bitch, now do I?

The Search for Magic Box
AIDS week. Would it be possible
for me to float the suggestion that
this is a waste of Union money, and
consequently a waste of your
money? The number of deaths in
Britain, ever, from AIDS, of people
outside of high-risk categories, is
less than the number of people who
die in Britain every day from
cancer. More people die in a week
from cancer than have AIDS, in the
UK.
But AIDS is preventable!' I hear
you say. Perhaps if a proportional
amount of cash was spent on cancer
research, they would find a cure for
that too.
'But AIDS cases are rising so
fast!' The propaganda continues.
The massive percentage rise is only
due to the fact that the incidence of
the disease is so low that just one
more person dying causes the figure
to rise.
How does this relate to music?
Freddie Mercury's tribute concert
sold out in six hours. 70,000
people. But it doesn't affect Sweef
Jesus. Flushed with the all round
praise of their debut single,
Phonefreak Honey, they play at the
New Cross Venue tonight. I
sincerely doubt 70,000 people will
turn up for that so no need to arrive
too early.
Over and onto Monday,
skimming quickly over Ingorance
on Saturday, to the River City
People, with Boo Hewerdine. Boo
is good. River City People are too,
even if they do come from
Liverpool. While I'm talking about
them, I'd just like to raise the point
that their new single is shit, but the
B-side, Like An Angel, is a brilliant
track. Thank you.
Tuesday features the ever
present Pele. Are you getting the
message yet? Incidentally, Airhead
are playing at the Camden Palace,
so I'd stay away from Camden if I
were you.
Wednesday features two college
bands, whose ability to arrange
practices when I feel like being
somewhere else is incredible.
Nonetheless, I'm sure they're good,
and not just because they're taller
than me, either.
The only mail I got last Friday
was a letter from a band. My Life
Story, indeed. But seeing as they
are one of the bestest bands on the
planet, I'll forgive them for getting
my hopes up unexpectedly.
