Fairy
Story
Once upon a time there was a
beautiful little princess called
Princess Consort Band. She was a
small little princess, but what she
lack in size, she more than made up
for in the happiness she gave to her
musicians. However, it occurred to
the Princess Concert Band that if
she was so small her voice may not
be heard at the approaching Conceit
Band Fairy Concert.
So the King of the land sent his
messengers to the far reaches of his
realm proclaiming to all his subjects
that all wind and brass instrument
players should meet in the Great
Hall on Mondays at 5.30pm. If you
play a wind or brass instrument and
you want the Princess Concert Band
to live happily ever after, then all
you need to do is close your eyes,
say T wish the Princess Concert
Band to live happily ever after', and
come to our rehearsals on Monday.
Shown below are the University
of London Inter-Collegiate League
Tables for 1991-1992, up till 8th
February. As can be seen, IC 4ths
are in danger of being promoted to
Division Three (where they should
have been in the first place), with
the IC 2nds having an outside
chance of winning Division Two.
The lsts and 3rds are doing
reasonably well, propping up 4th
place in their divisions, while the
5ths and 6ths are languishing near
the bottom of their respective
divisions (what more can you
expect from such a pathetic lot?).

Losers
On Wednesday 12th February, the
IC Football 5th sought revenge
against Q M W C 4ths at Harlington,
after their defeat away at QMWC's
amazing sloping pitch.
Soon after kick-off, Q M W C
scored from a sensational 30 yard
free-kick, given when the semi-
blind referee saw the 3rd foul.
However, the 5ths soon levelled it
when Captain Andy swung his leg
at the ball inside the penalty box and
shot on target (for once). They were
unlucky not to go 2-1 up after 6th
team stand-in, Nick, shot from
point blank range, but the shot was
save miraculously.
In the second half, the 5ths were
totally annihilated when Q M W C
shifted up a gear. Striker Andy
Reed was in danger of falling asleep
because the passing was so bad.
However, yet another 6th teamer,
Alex Cord, surpassed his usual
pitiful standards and made several
strong runs down the right wing,
only to be dispossessed. Eventually,
Q M W C went 2-1 up after a lone
striker slipped past his marker and
lobbed Simon Lam, out goalkeeper.
Throughout the game there were
scenes of near violence and threats
of G B H from the Captain to a
fellow defender. When the final
whistle went, the nightmare ended;
IC 5ths losing 2-1 and relegation
looming dangerously close...
