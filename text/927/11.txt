'How to be the
Penetrative Sex
For those moments when there's no
option but penetrative sex then the
best method of preventing HIV
transmission is by using 'your
flexible rubber friend' - the condom
(see separate item on condoms). As
well as the commonly known sheath
there is also a female condom
available which is also known as the
'bikini condom'. You may find
yourself with a partner who doesn't
want to use a condom. 80% of
young people use a condom when
they have sex. Don't risk your life
with the other 20%. Some men
complain that condoms reduce
sensitivity or that putting one on
interrupts love making. The fact is
that there are now many types of
condom available which do not
reduce sensitivity and putting a
condom on can become an erotic
part of the sexual activity.
And Finally....
Safer sex is healthier sex. The key
to safer sex in the age of AIDS is
honesty and open communication -
things which have taken a back seat
since sexual freedom and
How old is AIDS?
The AIDS virus was passed to
humans from monkeys in African
villages between 140 and 160 years
ago. Initially confined to a handful
of people in one or two villages,
possibly contaminated from
scratches and bites from monkeys,
this virus spread very slowly but
gathered pace as larger numbers
became infected.
Researchers from Imperial
College, London, led by Professor
Roy Anderson, head of biological
statistics, have examined the spread
of HIV in Africa. They conclude
that in some areas it now takes
between one and three years for the
number of cases to double in the
general population.
In some of the worst affected
parts of the continent, tests on blood
donors and pregnant women have
found that between 20 and 30 per
cent of people carry the virus. The
Imperial College team has found
that current HIV infection rates in
Africa are taking their biggest toll
in women aged 20-25, who are at
a peak age for child bearing, and in
men aged 25-35.
think sex is for?
performance became the
watchwords. You may be the kind
of person who finds it easier to have
sex with your partner than to talk
about it with him or her. A sensible
(and safe!) attitude would be to
make it part of your sex life to talk
openly about any worries and fears
you may have about HIV. Choosing
the right time and place to bring up
the subject of safer sex is important.
You are more likely to have a
successful, relaxed conversation
about safer sex if you don't leave
it until you are sexually aroused,
drunk, tired or in an emotional
state. It is usually best to bring the
subject up in a neutral setting (ie not
in the bedroom). A useful way to
start the conversation is by referring
to a T V programme or article about
AIDS or HIV. This will allow you
to find out what your partner thinks
in general before moving onto the
more personal issues. Don't wait
for your partner to bring the subject
up; it may never happen! The
responsibility in safer sex is above
all to yourself - looking after your
health. You can't always rely on a
partner to do that for you.
Whatever you do: if you're not
confident that it's safe then don't do
it!
Condoms
What some people say:
'They're passion killers. Just
when you want to go on you have
to stop and fumble around' - So
treat it as part of the sexual act -
practice makes perfect?
'It's like having a bath with
wellies on. I can't see the point of
having sex with a bit of rubber in
between' - Condoms are now so
fine you lose little, if any, sensation.
'If I carried a condom he'd call
me a slag' - It's becoming accepted
for women to . carry condoms
they're sensible not foolish.
'Why do we take condoms so
seriously? Having decided to use
them, why not make them fun to
What types are there:
Plain, ribbed, Straight end, Flared,
Contoured, Flavoured, Coloured,
Ultra thin, Glow in the Dark ('No
more fumble before you fondle')....
The list is endless. For a complete
guide there is a leaflet 'Which
Condom' available, alternatively
visit Condomania in Soho and
examine the displays.
To be sure of their safety, always
look for the BSI Kitemark as this
means the condoms are tested.
Where to get them:
This is a matter of personal choice.
Condoms have come out from
behind the counter. They're now
such a part of everyday life that you
can buy them from pharmacists,
garages, record shops,
supermarkets, barbers, clothes
shops, pubs, slot machines and mail
order.
If you want free supplies and/or
advice about sex and contraception
them you can go to the IC Health
centre or any other family planning
clinic. All you need to do is register
your name in their totally
confidential records.
For the condom connoisseurs,
there is a new type of shop -
'Condomania' opened in Soho and
recently one in Leeds. The aim is
to make condoms hip or even chic.
Almost every one of the thousands
of brands of condoms on the market
is stocked and there should be no
trouble with embarrassment as the
shop assistants are trained to cope
with embarrassed customers. As the
M D , Martin Foreman, says "No
one expects people to dress in the
same way in the daytime so why
should they have such limited
choice about what they put on at
night?"
