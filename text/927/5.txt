Going off the Boil
The IC football 1st team began the
season brilliantly by topping their
group in the U A U . In the first game
against RHBNC, Annan Galloway
got bored and decided to twat their
forward conceding a penalty and
then another leaving IC 2-0 down.
However, a great free-kick by
Rafael Martinez and a 40 yard shot
from Tom Robson finished the
game with a 2-2 draw.
Reading were IC's next
opponents and frankly they should
not have come. Two goals in the
first 5 minutes from Felix Francis
and Gary Mahoney ensured IC's
dominance for most of the game.
Reading came back but a goal from
Marv Abdo and his boil left the
game beyond reach. Man of the
match was awarded to Tom
'Fingers' Hulbert who made some
great saves with the help of Paul
Nelson, Annan, Dave Phillips and
Tom.
Kings College who hadn't lost a
game yet were next in line for an
IC thrashing. Before they could say
'what a good looking bunch IC are',
Gary had struck 2 goals in the back
of the net. With 10 minutes to go,
the score was 2-2 but Stuart 'Pecs'
Watson got the winner leaving
Kings 3-2 down at full time.
Next came Brunei in a
meaningless game as qualification
had already been ensured. The hair
raising captain, Marv, displayed his
excellent skills in a well executed
goal - pity they scored two. Man of
the match was Paul.
The visit of Nottingham finally
saw IC's dreams of U A U glory
shattered. Missing their midfield
maestro Felix to the dubious calling
of U L U , IC laboured to a 3-0 loss,
although the scoreline flattered the
opposition.
IC's powers in cup competitions
extended to the London Cup which
saw IC cruise to the semi-finals.
Despite giving RHBNC a 3-0 start,
IC moved into a higher gear to win
the first round match 4-3, with goals
from Marv, Felix, Rafael and the
winner, again, from Stuart.
The quarter-finals saw K C H
stuffed 7-1 with goals from Marv,
Bob, Gary (2), and a glorious
hatrick by Rafael, scoring the goal
Badminton
On 12th February, the Imperial
Badminton Ladies team played in
the quarter-finals of the U A U . With
the luck of the draw, we played at
home against Brunei University.
Both of our men's teams have
recently been knocked out in the
previous rounds, so it was up to us
to pick up the ashes. We felt we had
a good chance to get through since
we beat Brunei in the first round.
However, we did cast doubts
towards their first pair who were
very strong indeed. To our surprise,
they were not as strong as we
anticipated them to be. Our first
pair (Uta Boltz and Wendy Tan)
won their match in a truly
magnificent manner. Our second
pair (Wendy Yates and Emily Fok)
showed tremendous strength and
confidence to beat their opposition
15-2 and 15-1. Our third pair
(Claire Roberts and Jennifer Lau)
finished in an equally marvellous
fashion to win 15-7 and 15-2.
We only needed two more games
to secure our place in the semi-
finals. Our spirits were high and our
dream to go through to the semis
were about to come true. In the end
IC beat Brunei 7-2. The only
disappointment was the fact that we
only had four supporters (not
surprising since you never informed
Felix of the match - Ed) We would
like to thank them for coming and
hope that we get more support next
time.
Now we are in the semi-finals
which will take place tomorrow,
Saturday 22nd February, at Cardiff
University. We shall be competing
with'the strongest university teams,
some of which have the finest
badminton players in England. It
would be a wonderful experience
for the Ladies team, and who
knows, maybe we will bring back
a trophy with us!
of the season with a volley from
outside the area. The back 5: Tim,
Annan, Paul, Tom and Dave, were
denied a clean sheet through a
dubious penalty. Even after 2
games, IC were the only team not
to be beaten by Kings but this
changed in a 5-1 loss in the semi-
finals, with top scorer Gary getting
IC's only goal. Man of the match
was Annan.
It should be said that despite the
Kings and Nottingham games IC
lsts have had a good season and the
line up in the picture is still
unbeaten. Only injuries and
disappearance of their good luck
charm, the captain's boil, has
stopped IC from going all the way.
Rugby
The Imperial College rugby first
X V beat Surrey University by 20
points to 3 last week at Harlington,
in the quarter-finals of the U A U
Championship. The conditions did
not allow flowing movement of the
ball but the forwards soon took
control.
John Fowler was denied two tries
as the Surrey scrummage collapsed
on their own line, resulting in the
award of two penalty tries, Simon
Pearson scored a try from another
pushover. Stuart Paynter scored
two penalty goals and converted one
try, missing one from in front of the
posts - charged down.
ICRFC are now set to meet
Durham University at a neutral
ground on Wednesday 26th
February, three days after the
Gutteridge Cup final. Free transport
will be available for spectators to
both matches and support would be
welcome.
