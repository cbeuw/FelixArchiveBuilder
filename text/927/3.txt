Millions of people starve in this
shite heap we call the world. To
countless billions more, life is
nothing but a fifty year long
collection of assorted miseries.
Measles kills millions of children in
what is termed 'the third world' -
a term which puts the majority of
people on the planet at the end of
the queue. Perhaps for 'third world'
we should read 'third class.'
So forgive me if I promulgate an
unusual view concerning AIDS.
Death is an appalling tragedy, no
matter who it is who dies, so I find
it nothing less than revolting that so
much money is being spent on
finding expensive drugs which will
only benefit a few hundred thousand
- at the most - when minimal
investment would save millions of
lives and improve billions more. If
you think any anti-AIDS drug will
benefit any of the millions who have
it in Africa, think again. To
governments who spend what little
they have on buying equipment to
kill large numbers of people more
effectively, drugs are a luxury,
particularly since they cannot feed
those who would survive. Don't get
me wrong - AIDS is a horrible
disease, it is not a 'punishment', nor
does anyone 'deserve' it and I wish
that nobody had it - hence I view
the information contained within
this issue, which aims to prevent the
spread of the disease, with great
approval. The hysteria surrounding
the disease is completely out of
proportion to the damage it does.
More people die in traffic accidents.
Is anything done about this? No.
The image that immediately
presents itself is of an evening party
of self indulgent brats complaining
bitterly that it may come to an end,
while the poor of the town press
their noses up against the window.
AIDS is avoidable. It is no more
deadly than a hundred other
diseases, but merely because it has
put the frighteners on the 'first
world', so used to doing exactly
what it likes, buckets of money has
been poured into it.
I hope a cure is found for AIDS,
and I wish I could help those who
have it, but to be impartial about the
issue, I wish far more strongly that
starving countries could be given
access to the cure they need. Unlike
AIDS, the cure for starvation is
known. If a cure for AIDS is found,
like the cure for starvation, that cure
will never benefit the developing
world. After all, they are all
foreigners, mostly black, and they
have committed the worst sin of all
- they are very poor.
Changing their Spots
There appears to be a flurry of
name changing going on in the
academic establishments around the
country at the moment. The
University of Wales College,
Cardiff (UWCC) has mooted the
possibility of changing to the
'University of Cardiff if the
Polytechnic of Wales becomes the
'University of Glamorgan.' In this
week's Pluto, of Lancashire
Polytechnic, the lead story was of
the possibility of becoming the
'University of Lancashire in
Preston' (UCLiP). Pluto also
reported that Oxford University
may become the 'University of
Central Oxfordshire in Oxford,'
allowing Oxford Polytechnic to
become 'Oxford University.' And
the Polytechnic of Central London
is thinking of becoming the
'University of Westminster.'
What the hell is going on? I
suspect each institution is trying to
outbid their competitors by finding
the most cumbersome name which
will stick out in a list. By this yard
stick the Imperial College of
Science, Technology and Medicine
should remain so for quite a while.
Sadly, the Imperial bit does seem
rather old fashioned, and college is,
after all, a diminutive version of an
academic institution. Given that the
College has obvious pretensions
towards independence, and it gets
directly funded by the Universities'
Funding Council (UFC), unlike all
other London University colleges,
it seems likely that we will graduate
to Universitydom within the decade
future. And what if we merge with
the Royal College of Music in
Prince Consort Road? That would
lend a far more civilised air to the
college, as would merger with the
nearby Royal College of Art. There
have long been rumblings of merger
with the Royal Holloway and
Bedford New College, near Staines,
and Brunei University in Uxbridge.
St Mary's may soon open
negotiations with the Charing Cross
Hospital. Open the curtains on the
'West London and Middlesex
University of Science, Technology,
Medicine, Music and Art' or
W L M U S T M M A .
Whoopee-do. I can't wait.
