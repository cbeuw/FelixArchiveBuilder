services and psychologists to try
and achieve the best support
possible for the patients.
The atmosphere on the ward is
not one of doom and gloom, of
course there is great sadness when
a patient dies, but somehow a
positive attitude is maintained for
most of the time, and I can honestly
say I enjoyed the week I spent there.
At the end of my week on the ward
I had learnt a lot about basic nursing
care but also a great deal about
AIDS). HIV + ve patients and the
importance of being able to sit and
listen, without necessarily offering
advice or comforting words.
