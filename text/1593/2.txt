This week we are looking at
the story of Charlie Hebdo,
something that no doubt is
already familiar to many of you, but
still a story that is ongoing. Despite
the fact that Charlie Hebdo has now
bravely managed to put out their next
issue in an act that proves they can’t
be stopped by such savagery, there
are still many questions that remain
unanswered.
These include the debate over what
constitutes an expression of free
speech and what is crossing the line,
and yet another debate if there is even
a line to tread.
The debate over printing the
cartoons is also ongoing, with papers
facing a daily battle over defending
their choice to replicate the images
or not. Felix has decided not to
reprint the images of the Prophet
Muhammad as a show of respect
to our diverse readership and their
beliefs, but we have printed the front
cover we would have run with last
week if we had gone to print.
Unlike all the national papers that
week in the UK, we made a cover
comprised of a select few previous
Charlie Hebdo covers, to represent
that nous sommes Charlie too. We
may not agree with how tasteless
some of their images may have been,
and though we would not print
everything that the magazine have
done in the past, we agree they have
the right to print them and not face
the risk of death in doing so.
If we shy away from standing
with the magazine because of
how potentially sexist, racist or
Islamophobic they are interpreted
as, then we are also abandoning our
support of their right to express
views no matter how they are
interpreted. The right to offend is
not a comfortable right to defend,
but it falls under the umbrella of
free speech, which, to succeed in its
purpose in full, must be absolute.
We, as an audience then have every
right to challenge the media if we are
offended, and this too is an absolute
right.
Just like we print our centrefold, or
our horoscopes, or even some of my
more frightful late night articles, we
do so because we’ve reasoned that we
think they are appropriate to print
such material for whatever purpose
we align with as a publication. We
can therefore exercise that right
without fear for our lives. The same
unfortunately could not be said for
those working for Charlie Hebdo.
These people weren’t fighting for
anything when they put pen to paper,
and didn’t have any real cause to
defend when they went to print each
week. They simply enjoyed pushing
the boundaries of humour, critical
thought and, if nothing else, print
pure, sometimes illogical crassness
that most people would pick up,
maybe chuckle over (or simply
grimace at), then move on with their
day.
As a publication, pushing those
boundaries was part of their niche,
and they occupied it in the way
they seemed fit. Part of our niche
as a student paper is to inform our
diverse body of students about what
is going on at University and in our
local area, so printing these cartoons
in particular does not help us in
succeeding as a publication.
However, our niche as an editorially
independent newspaper is also to
print what we do feel is appropriate,
which aligns with the principles that
Charlie Hebdo stood for, and what
any true free press should stand
for too. That is why we are Charlie
Hebdo, and we are truly saddened by
what happened.
