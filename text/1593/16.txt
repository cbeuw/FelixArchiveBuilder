Reese Witherspoon goes through
a career comeback of sorts,
after starring in a string of
disappointing films after her Oscar
win. Her raw, uncompromising,
uninhibited performance is without
doubt the best thing she has done in
years, and her production company
securing the rights to produce Cheryl
Strayed’s autobiography was a smart
move, as evidenced by the accolades
she has been receiving lately. It is
Witherspoon’s very own Eat Pray
Love, but unlike Julia Roberts’
cringeworthy, self-indulgent vom-fest
of a film, this one feels truly personal.
After several personal setbacks,
Strayed (Witherspoon) spirals
violently out of control, ending up in
a drug-fuelled, sex-filled mess. Hitting
rock bottom kick-starts her decision
to do something about and with her
life, and that leads to her embarking
on a solo trek across the Pacific Crest
Trail. She is not trying to set a record
for herself, nor is she doing this for
any other incentive than to find
herself, to heal, and to go back to what
once was a peaceful, grounded life.
From the get-go the trek poses
great challenges. Seeing the petite
Witherspoon struggle with her
weighty travelling backpack
offers some laughs, as do her self-
deprecating narrative remarks that
remind her that this may not have
been such a good idea. She has the
wrong gas canister so ends up not
being able to cook, pitching a tent
turns out to be harder than it looks,
and walking for miles and miles
under the sun takes a toll on her
feet, her toenails (a rather graphic
but necessary scene focuses on this
aspect), and her stamina overall.
Beautifully edited together to show
her present time at the Trail, as well
as weaving together relevant scenes
from her past that led up to this point,
you quickly get the overall picture
as to where it all went wrong in the
first place. Strayed’s mother Bobbi
(Laura Dern) plays a big part in the
flashbacks, and yes, it does appear to
be a slightly odd casting decision to
have someone who is only nine years
older than Witherspoon to play her
mother. But Dern is so wonderfully
warm and maternal that the age gap
hardly seems to matter in the end,
and the two actresses work so well
together to create a touching mother-
daughter connection.
They share particularly a tender
moment in which Dern’s character
wisely guides her daughter to be
appreciative of all the positive
things left in her life, even in the
most challenging situations. Cheryl
naturally rolls her eyes and dismisses
her corny mother, but it is a small,
standout moment in a film that is full
of these little gems.
This is Witherspoon like you have
never seen her before. She has two
timelines to juggle essentially and is
wonderful in every minute and frame
of the film. Her struggles along the
Trail, the wilderness she encounters as
well as some particularly unsavoury
characters she comes across, make
the end result all the more inspiring,
whilst also sporadically throwing
in the eventual near breakdown
in her past heightens the sense of
achievement. Just how far she has
come as a person when the film closes,
should serve as an inspiration for
us all, to always live your life to the
fullest.

Written and shot by the
young American director
Damien Chazelle, Whiplash
is an ambitious piece of storytelling
that chronicles the development
and suffering of a young musician
with dreams of becoming one
of the greatest drummers of his
generation. The film follows Shaffer
Conservatory of Music freshman
Andrew Nieman (Miles Teller), who
is handpicked by the demanding
and much-feared teacher, Terence
Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), to be a
drummer in a jazz orchestra created
for the competition circuit.
Bald, muscly and always wearing
black clothes, Terence Fletcher is
volatile and predatory from the
outset. In his position of power
Fletcher uses intimidation and
fear tactics to push his jazz band
to perfection. He uses his students
as though they themselves are
instruments that need to be
manipulated to get the sound he
wants. At times Fletcher’s actions
push past the point of credibility and
the plot in general gradually becomes
less believable as it builds to a climax.
Unforgiving barks such as
“alternates, will you clean the blood
off my drum set?” and “I’m not going
to have you cost us a competition
because your mind’s on a fucking
Happy Meal instead of on pitch” are
directed at anyone who isn’t up to
scratch. His enraged monologues feel
simultaneously horrific and darkly
humorous.
Fletcher makes no apologies for his
tough love and is confident that the
next great drummer will rise to the
occasion. He puts a face to the cut-
throat world of the performing arts
and this savage character brings out
a truly unforgettable performance by
J.K. Simmons.
Andrew deals with Fletcher’s
mental and physical abuse by
subjecting himself to days of
intensive practice in a frantic
obsession to gain a stronger beat.
This makes for one of the most
emotionally charged montages I’ve
ever seen on the big screen. The film
details Andrew’s suffering with an
almost pornographic sensibility.
Lingering close-ups of the blood,
sweat and tears shed during the film
are used to highlight the pervading
atmosphere of sadomasochism that
the central characters inhabit. Few
films maintain such a strong feeling
of suspense throughout, and Whiplash
is one of them.
With a total running time of just
106 minutes, the tight editing keeps
the audience engaged throughout and
adds to the impact of the storytelling.
In a time where many films are too
long and too dumb, Whiplash makes
for a refreshingly raw and enigmatic
watch.
However, Andrew is too much of a
blank slate away from his drum kit
and the film would have benefitted
by fleshing out his character. The
relationship Andrew initiates with
Nicole (Melissa Benoist) near the
beginning of the film feels too much
like a throwaway subplot. Nicole
is simply there to provide contrast
between her indecisive outlook on life
as a mediocre student, and Andrew - a
rapacious tunnel-visionary.
Their brief relationship comes
across as a weak attempt to
demonstrate the sacrifices Andrew
feels he must make under the
distressing conclusion that he cannot
love and drum at the same time. The
blunt break-up explanation shows the
first signs that Andrew is beginning to
see the method in Fletcher’s madness.
Whiplash has little to say about the
practices of the characters it follows,
except for making you wonder, in this
struggle for the beau ideal, whether
the sacrifice is worth the reward.
The title of the film refers to the
Hank Levy song of the same name,
which is played during Andrew’s
audition. But the title also alludes
to the break-neck speeds with which
Andrew’s situation changes, usually
coming as a result of his teacher’s
calculated exploits. Fletcher’s
seemingly instantaneous transitions
between periods of neglect and bursts
of savagery is what makes this film
so exhilarating and Damian Chazelle
does a fantastic job of captivating
the emotional whiplash that Andrew
experiences.
Despite the amount of drumming
in the film, Whiplash is more of a
suspense thriller than a musical
drama. Music merely provides a
backdrop in this whirlwind exposition
of an intense mentor protégé
relationship, during which we observe
Andrew’s metamorphosis from a shy,
lonely first-year to a musician every
bit as stubborn as his teacher.
Whiplash has its faults, but you
cannot criticise the execution, with
thrillingly fetishistic cinematography
thanks to Sharone Meir and a great
soundtrack from Justin Hurwitz to
boot. Critics have gone as far to say
that Whiplash is to drumming what
Raging Bull is to boxing. For a 29-year-
old to create such a visceral piece of
cinema in only his second feature
length film on a shoestring budget of
$3.3 million is simply astounding.
