This week’s Charlie Hebdo
poster features a cartoon
man portrayed as the prophet
Mohammed, crying and holding a
sign reading “Je suis Charlie.” Above
is the slogan “Tout est pardonné”
(You’re forgiven).
Many Muslim people find this
offensive. Not just because Islam
forbids portraying the prophet in
image, but because of the stereotyping
of the image itself. A dark-skinned
man with a skinny face, long thin
nose and hagged beard – it’s a cliché.
A stereotype. It’s reminiscent of
drawings of Jewish people with big
noses hoarding money drawn in
1930s Germany. It’s not subtle, just
deliberately offensive, and very
French.
In an open and free society you
can say and draw what you want.
In practice we all live with a certain
degree of censorship, whether self-
inflicted, culturally instilled, or
by a government’s laws. In the UK
it’s illegal to incite hatred against
someone because of his or her
religion. It’s illegal to defame or
slander people. We self-censor – when
Felix ran a Hangman article a few
years ago about Chemistry students
using Rohypnol to get a date, it was
quite rightly slammed. As a student
newspaper, is it our role to offend our
readership? No – we’re supposed to
represent the student community of
Imperial; produced for the students,
by the students.
This is why, along with mainstream
media outlets, we’re not reprinting
the images of the prophet. It’s
needlessly offensive and if you want
to see them a quick Google search
throws them up.
This doesn’t mean it’s ever wrong
for anyone to publish them. A design
blog I follow reproduced it. It’s not
possible for a design blog to ignore
what is to become one of the most
iconic magazine covers of the year
and discuss why it is so, without also
showing it; you can’t review offensive
literature without reading it, or a film
without watching it.
Should Charlie Hebdo be printing
these images in the first place? If they
want to, it’s their right. But as they
are fully aware, they open themselves
up to being justifiably criticised,
often offensively. Interestingly, few
seem to be doing so. Ironically, being
violently attacked seems to protect
them from insults themselves: no one
wants to satirise murders.
Most of us aren’t Charlie Hebdo.
We go through life thinking about
what we say, being tolerant of others’
views, and doing our best to get on.
If we truly were all Charlie Hebdo,
then the world would be a worse
place. In our global society it’s more
important than ever to get on with
each other. The internet, cheap travel,
and growing economies are throwing
cultures together and many of us are
still learning. We’re a long way from
the anti-Semitism of the 1930s, but
we still have much to do. Recent polls
of Jewish people living in Paris and
the UK shows significant numbers of
people fearing they have no future.
We all need to embrace the
global culture we’re faced with. It’s

COMMENT WRITER
Whilst I’m writing this to
help provide a Muslim
perspective on the recent
Charlie Hedbo attacks, I do wonder
how necessary that is. After all, is the
Muslim perspective on the murder of
over a dozen civilians really going to
be different to the universal human
perspective? Do you, Imperial College
students, really need reassurance that
your Muslim colleagues in no way
condone such actions? Thankfully,
I don’t think you do. When you
think of ‘Islam’, your personal
experiences and interactions with
‘normal Muslims’ at university can
help you overcome the imagery of
AK-47 laden, freedom-hating bigotry
that Fox News or the Daily Mail
would have others believe defines
this religion. But not everybody
has this counterbalance of personal
experience to fight off the recent
ignorance-fuelled hatred and fear.
It’s only natural, therefore, that us
UK-based Muslims feel a sense of
apprehension when we see the media
frame such incidents as a ‘clash of
civilizations’ – the liberty loving
West vs. the barbarism of Islam.
One more step in what seems to be
the inexorable path towards making
Muslims ‘the other’.
Let’s not let that happen. Let’s
make the effort to identify and
communicate our overwhelming
similarities to others whose only
exposure to Muslims is through the
fear-mongering cover pages of The
Sun, and pave the way for a more
harmonious future society.
As for the matter of ‘freedom of
speech’ – this is a topic beyond the
myopic snapshot of the current
controversy. The decision on how far
the legal right to offend others with
your speech extends is not something
I am interested in, as I would hope
this wouldn’t act as the determining
factor in most people’s behavior. (Am
I legally entitled to make fun of you
for being fat? Should I do so?)
That being said, if people for the
sake of ‘comedic value’ choose to
push these boundaries, the threat
of physical harm should not be
looming over them. If you are the
resident of a country you implicitly
agree to abide by its laws. If you find
something distasteful, your response
should be within the legal framework
– Muslims of France, I’m sure, will
have refrained from buying this
magazine in a completely acceptable
show of disdain prior to this mindless
incident.
Whilst physical manifestations of
displeasure are never justifiable, it
is my unequivocal right as a Muslim
to be offended by such lewd cartoon
depictions of the Prophet Muhammad
(peace be upon him, ‘PBUH’).
‘Lighten up, it’s just satire! They drew
disrespectful pictures of the Pope,

Jesus (PBUH) and the Virgin Mary
as well and you didn’t see Christians
getting upset!’ I, for one, certainly
won’t be ‘lightening up’. Whether or
not others are capable of laughing at
their religious figures has no bearing
on what my expected reaction should
be.
Myself and other Muslims around
the world may have a degree of
reverence and respect for the
Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) that is
difficult for those from the outside
to understand, but it will not be
changing. It’s worth noting here that
within our faith Jesus (PBUH) and the
Virgin Mary are also exalted figures,
and so whilst many Christians may
not take offense to their mockery,
Muslims also find this extremely
upsetting.
The point being – champion your
right to offend by all means, but don’t
try to impinge upon my right to feel
offended. If you decide that you want
to mock the Prophet Muhammad
(PBUH), then do so knowing that
you will be upsetting myself and all
other regular Muslims who you live
and work with, and who have no
animosity towards you. If you still
choose to exercise your ‘freedom
of speech’ in such manifestations,
the only choice Muslims should
consider is to respond within the legal
framework, and never to resort to
vigilante retribution.

Free speech and my right to be offended
Should my reaction depend on whether others find it funny?

important now, more than ever, that
we are tolerant of the views of others,
and also show respect for them. We
need some Charlie Hebdos to remind
us of our flaws, but it’s far more
important to embrace one another’s
own humanity.
