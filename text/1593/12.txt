Our story began two months
ago, when we founded our
sustainable fashion business
– Clotho London. The day of our
graduation, swathed in black robes
amongst the deep reds and grand
mahogany of the Royal Albert Hall,
we twitched with excitement in our
seats as our phones buzzed. Each
buzz signified another transacting
customer, another sign of validation
that all our previous efforts had not
been completely crazy.
Or perhaps our story actually
began five years ago, when I met
my cofounder Caroline during our
first week at Imperial. We studied
chemistry together, and became lab
partners in third year. From that
moment on a dream team was born!
Not for chemistry alas – our routine
usually consisted of us donning
our lab coats and goggles, making
a cameo appearance in the lab lest
the supervisors suspected us of
skiving, and then sneaking off to the
computer room to watch Gossip Girl.
With the end of University
approaching fast, we would talk
avidly about ways we could avoid
applying for finance grad schemes,
law conversion courses, teaching,
and perhaps must of all, chemistry.
All these options are great, but not
suitable for us. We were told that the
world is our oyster after graduating
with a science degree, but none of the
usually possibilities appealed.
Life really is too short to do
something that doesn’t make you
happy, but we didn’t even know what
it was that made us happy. These
rather gloomy thoughts loomed over
us, growing ever stronger as each
day passed. After our finals, I was
poised to take a gap year, travelling
aimlessly in the hope of finding that
elusive aim. Caroline was prepared to
enter corporate life, having accepted
a position in a consultancy firm.
We caught up one afternoon in the
late summer sunshine, and started
to daydream together again. We
used to toy with the idea of starting
a business, and were convinced that
making cosmetics was the field for
us. Caroline even bought a hundred
empty lip balm containers at one
point, and we set up a rudimentary
kitchen laboratory. However, we
realised that for two penniless
graduates, it was just not feasible to
start a cosmetics business without
any capital. Thus it was back to the
drawing board.
The seed for Clotho London had
been planted during our post-uni
girls trip to Marrakech earlier in the
summer. We were preparing to go
out one evening and I was making a
fuss, deliberating over what to wear.
Caroline kindly asked me if I would
like to take one of her dresses. She
had brought it along for the trip but
had never worn it, despite owning
it for years. I felt guilty for taking
her clothes, but she insisted, saying
that otherwise it would be a waste.
I tried it on and loved it so much
that I basically never took it off all
summer! Remembering this moment,
we thought that many girls must have
items that they never wear any more.
The textile industry is a beast that
consumes huge amounts of resources
like water and fuel. Almost 150
million tons of shoes and clothing are
sold worldwide every year, yet only
a very small part finds its way back
into the production cycle – especially
disappointing since textiles are in
the top five landfill materials that
can be either recycled or repurposed
for other uses. The textiles industry
is also often associated with poor
working conditions in order to supply
cheap fashion. We can’t ask people to
stop buying new clothes – that would
be like asking people to give up food
in favour of soylent. No one would do
it. So we came up with Clotho London,
which allows people to satisfy their
materialistic wants and needs with
minimal impact on the environment,
lowering the demand for cheaper
items that may be produced by
workers in unacceptable conditions.
Recent graduate Vivien Tang introduces you to Clotho and the u
Clotho essentially encourages women
to exchange their clothing – we
collect items from their homes to
make it as convenient as possible. The
items are then sorted, photographed
and listed on our online shop. For the
items that they submit, our customers
receive credit, which they can redeem
for new outfits in our shop. We charge
just a transaction fee for each new
item that the customer purchases.
Once we had properly fleshed out
our ideas for Clotho, we decided
that the next step would be to test
out our clothes exchange idea. So
we organised a ‘Bitch ‘n’ Switch’
event – an evening chez Caroline
with all of our favourite girlfriends,
where we brought along our old
clothes. We then swapped items with
each other over nibbles, drinks and
gossip. The evening was a success; our
friends went home that night with
completely new wardrobes, and were
supportive about us taking the plunge
to set up Clotho. With nothing to lose,
we threw caution to the wind and got
to work.
Caroline had a meeting with
Alice Bentinck, the co-founder
of Entrepreneur First (a start up
accelerator programme), to ask if
we could join this year’s cohort late
with our business idea. Alice must
be inundated with requests like this
on a daily basis, so told us that she
would consider it if we could prove
that we had hundreds of transacting
customers in a month’s time. We
interpreted her words quite literally,
and set ourselves a one-month
challenge. Whilst that seemed
initially to be ample time for us to
achieve the goal, a quick breakdown
of the month ahead revealed that we
had essentially a week to persuade as
many girls as possible to sign up for a
trial run. We hastily cobbled together
a rudimentary landing page with
a signup form. Armed with iPads,
we started to roam around London,
pouncing on stylish girls to persuade
them to sign up. We covered most of
the London universities, Westfields,
High Street Kensington, and the
pubs around Fulham. Persuading
strangers to signup to something
that essentially didn’t exist yet was
more difficult than we imagined, but
we gritted our teeth through all the
rejections and managed to acquire a
list of just over 400 girls at the end of
the week. After calling everyone on
our list, we assembled 50 girls who
were available to take part in our
pilot, and began collecting their items.
We spent that week mostly on the
Underground, annoying commuters
by taking up too much space with our
huge bags of clothes.
My bedroom was converted into our
photography studio by taping white
paper to the floor. With absolutely
no idea as to what we were doing, we
began pointing a camera at clothes
and snapping photos. We thought
"Our
routine
consisted
of us
making
a cameo
appearance
in the lab
and then
sneaking
off to the
computer
room to
watch
Gossip
Girl."
"We
thought
that many
girls must
have items
that they
never wear
any more."
