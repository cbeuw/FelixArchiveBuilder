Clint Eastwood directs the
true story of American hero
Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper),
a celebrated war hero from Texas
who, during his four tours in Iraq,
managed to set the record for having
the most number of kills as a sniper,
with 160 confirmed and probably
even more.
Being a film made by Americans
for Americans, the never-ending
debate the film is likely to spark
surrounding the morality of his
actions is irrelevant, and Eastwood is
only interested in making a tightly
focused biographical war film looking
solely at Kyle himself.
A keen long-range shooter from
a young age, American patriotism
is instilled early into the minds of
Chris and his younger brother Jeff.
Attacks on U.S. Embassies around the
world spark his interest in joining the
Navy SEALs, and before he knows it
he is being deployed to his first tour,
leaving behind his wife, Taya (Sienna
Miller). Events progress rapidly from
the point where Chris is shown as
a child, to how he sails through the
training to become a SEAL.
The training montage conveys
nothing spectacular, aside from
hammering home the point that
Kyle would do anything to serve his
country, which he regards as the best
country in the world, and that it is
this unshakeable mindset that drives
him to persevere.
The various deadly missions in
Iraq are the film’s highlight; the
tautly shot action sequences easily
build tension. The dilemmas Kyle
faces alone in silence as the rooftop
guardian for all the soldiers on the
ground, mostly involving child and
female Iraqi individuals who attack
the troops, are effective in creating a
confusing moral debate with tough
choices to be made in a short time
span for Kyle. The safety of his
brothers in arms depends on whether
he decides to take the shot or not, but
the repetitive killing does eventually
take its toll on Kyle.
It is from this point on that the film
unravels, never giving its leading man
Cooper enough material to portray
a man going through some form of
post-traumatic stress, merely sticking
him in cliché-ridden scenarios.
Valuable supporting characters are
nowhere to be found: Kyle’s father
is only seen in the first few minutes.
He is referenced once, never to be
mentioned again. His brother too is
seen only briefly, and doesn’t return.
Miller has a thankless, meatless
role as Kyle’s wife, which is surprising
given how her character was set
up when the two of them first
meet. We are also never allowed to
connect with anyone besides Kyle
himself, which is why the on-screen
deaths of American soldiers whose
character names you will not be
able to remember remain just as
unmemorable as the deaths of the
Iraqi enemies.
As a viewer it is only natural to
wonder who Kyle really is, how the
war affected his mental state, to what
extent he enjoyed the killing of those
who threatened his beloved homeland
and the how he coped with the process
of adjusting to life back in America.
But the film is only interested in
painting Kyle as the reluctant hero,
and it is that much more difficult
to relate to this one-dimensional
individual without a coherent story.
TESTAMENT OF

SECTION EDITOR
Vera Brittain’s First World War
memoir is given the big screen
treatment in this sweeping war
epic, which tries to be as grand and
spectacular as the superior classics.
It is a film that puts its heroine into
unimaginable ordeals, made all the
more heart-breaking by its “based on
a true story” nature.
However the tragic aspect of its
themes is never quite as impactful
as it should be, with a lack of crucial
character development standing in
the way of creating a truly convincing
spark between the leads. The film tells
an incredible, unforgettable story,
but it surely could have had a better
transition from page to screen.
That being said, rapidly rising star
Alicia Vikander is excellent in the
lead role. The narrative encompasses
years of Brittain’s life, starting with
her as a young rebellious female
wanting to study at Oxford University
in the 1910s. She even finds time
for love, locking eyes with Roland
Leighton (Kit Harington), who
impresses her by writing poetry and
taking long walks in the woods.
Everything seems to be going
swimmingly for Vera until war breaks
out, turning her world upside down.
Vikander embodies the many changes
of her character fully, whilst always
holding on to her fighting spirit
no matter what situation she finds
herself in.
Roland signs up to fight for his
country willingly, as a part of his
patriotic duty, as does her brother
Edward (Taron Egerton), and her
close friend, Victor Richardson
(Colin Morgan). Little do they know
that this war would drag on for four
years, taking countless lives with it.
Vera also does her part in the war,
postponing her university studies
to serve as a nurse. “Our youth has
been stolen from us” she says in her
narration.
The horrors of war are captured
in a predictable but solid manner,
seen through the eyes of Vera during
her days as a nurse. There is a scene,
echoing Gone with the Wind, in which
lines and lines of the wounded and
dead are slowly revealed in an aerial
shot. The profound effect this visual
had in a 1939 film still works today
in 2015.
Less well-established are the
supposedly close bonds shared by the
characters that ultimately matter
in the end for that all-important
emotional resonance. Vera and
Roland look longingly at each other,
but the close of their relationship is
held back by unexpected restraint.
Even the portrayal of the most tragic
event that hits our heroine does not
come across as a worthy tribute.
The film also neglects the other two
important men in Vera’s life, her
brother and her friend-zoned secret
admirer, significantly reducing their
relevance in the telling of her story.
Commendable are the technical
achievements: the warm, comfortable
pre-War period setting, followed by
the more frantic, harsh atmosphere
of a deadly war; the lush costumes;
and the effortless editing together
of scenes that span quite a timeline.
Anchored by a strong lead
performance this is by no means an
insult to Vera Brittain’s literary work,
but also a film in which more should
have been felt in its closing moments.
