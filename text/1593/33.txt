Let’s score a goal for equality
In 1990, Justin Fashanu was
the first English professional
footballer to come out as gay.
Throughout this, he faced abuse from
his teammates, fellow players and
even his manager. He committed
suicide just eight years later.
Equality in sport has come a long
way since Justin Fashanu’s death.
From 23 openly lesbian, gay and
bisexual Olympians competing at the
Olympics in London, to role models
such as Jason Collins in basketball,
Robbie Rogers in football, and Tom
Daley in diving. Add in Casey Stoney
who has captained both Arsenal and
England’s women’s football team, and
you can see that there definitely has
been a change.
However, there is still a long
way to go to challenge perceptions
and problems facing lesbian, gay,
bisexual and transgender sports
people. Thankfully, there are groups
and campaigns such as “Football vs
Homophobia” and “Pride Sports”
which are working to challenge these
issues.
Yet it is still not uncommon to hear
homophobic slurs on the side-lines of
some large sports matches or sporting
professionals using homophobic
remarks behind the scenes.
Often transgender people who want
to be involved in sports face huge
barriers too, and it is often unclear
on how they can be involved with
each National Governing Body of
each sport having a different stance
or policy.
What about University sport and
students?
A recent survey carried out by
the National Union of Students
called ‘Out in Sport’ found that
nearly 50% of LGBT students who
do not participate in sport find the
culture around sport alienating or
unwelcoming.
Furthermore, almost 20% of
LGBT students who participate in
team sport are not open about their
sexuality to anyone, and of those a
further 20% are worried it might
result in verbal or physical abuse on
account of homophobia, transphobia
or biphobia.
Sport is such an integral part of
many students’ life at university.
Whether one competes in the elite of
their field, joins a club or a team to
develop their skills or make friends,
or just gets together with students
from their class, research group or
halls to play a game in Hyde Park, the
fact is that sport does an excellent job
at bringing people together.
Every student at Imperial,
who wants to, should feel able to
participate in all the sport offered
through our huge number and
wide variety of teams and clubs at
Imperial.
As part of this, we’ve decided to
research the experiences of students
who take part in sport at Imperial. We
want to find barriers to engagement
or if there are positive experiences of
LGBT students feeling accepted and
welcomed as part of a team. (We want
to celebrate those!)
Feeling accepted regardless of
sexuality means that students will
feel more comfortable and able to
focus on their sport, and will be able
to play better.
Once we have the results of the
survey, we will look to identify
changes we can make to ensure that
teams feel supported in tackling
homophobia in their sport, or
creating an easier method of
reporting incidents of homophobia,
or running a campaign where we ask
sports teams to come out for equality.
You can take part in the survey
via the recent ‘Inclusive Sport at
Imperial: Survey’ post on the Union
website.
All responses are confidential and
most questions are optional should
you uncomfortable with disclosing
certain types of information.
Furthermore, we will be holding
in-depth interview sessions to further
our research, so please do your note
down your email if you are interested.
Alternatively, you can contact me at
icu-lgbt@imperial.ac.uk, along with any
questions you might have regarding
this survey.
Enjoyment of sport shouldn't be barred by sexual orientation and the survey will take a shot to address homophobia on the sports field.
