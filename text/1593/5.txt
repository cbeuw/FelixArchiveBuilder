particularly considering the Square is
named after a battle with the French
and Spanish!”
With Paris holding the focus of the
world’s media on Sunday, as world
leaders came together to lead the
march through the city, one London
student took to twitter to point out
their sheer hypocrisy.
Daniel Wickham, a 21 year old
student from the London School of
Economics pointed out how many of
the leaders were representing states
where free speech had previously
been threatened or downright
disregarded.
Wickham told the Guardian after
his series of tweets went viral: “There
were so many representatives there
from countries with really awful
human rights records, like Saudi
Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain.
“I’d already seen people tweet
that the march was like a who’s who
of authoritarian leaders, and I just
thought it was a real shame that the
event, which is supposed to be for the
victims of human rights violations,
was being hijacked by human rights
abusers.”
Yemen’s branch of Al Queada
released a video on Thursday,
claiming responsibility for the attack,
and stating they were carried out in
“It was a
funny paper
written by
funny people.”
Felix spoke to Camille
Grellet,a Bioengineer and the
vice president of the French
Society.Camille was in France
during the attack,and told
us how the country seemed
to go into a state of shock.
Stations,shops and locations
of interest were closed whilst
the terrorists were still on the
run,and people were advised
to stay in their home.
However,Camille said that
people wouldn’t let what
happen stop them continuing
to live their lives.“People now
know not to be afraid after
what happened; it was one
of the slogans of the demo
on Sunday in Paris,and the
people of France won’t let
what happened impact on
their freedom of speech.
“People were cautious and
initially scared after the
attack,but didn’t let it keep
them hidden away for long.
The country woke up and
kept going,and the display of
solidarity in Paris during the
Sunday demo was something
that had never been seen
before.
“It is important to point out
just what Charlie Hebdo was:
it was a funny newspaper ran
by funny people,nice people
with families,people who
didn’t mean genuine harm.
They poked fun at everything,
not just Islam,but in no
way did they deserve what
happened.
“When it initially happened,
we were in shock.We flocked
to the television and all
people could do was watch
it unfold.The country froze
for three days,and only when
the culprits were caught did
people relax and continue
with our lives.
“We need to fight what
happened together,and not
forget what happened.You
aren’t going to take control a
country by doing this.We are
stronger then that.”
retaliation for the publications of
the Prophet Mohammad. However,
the magazine is nothing if not
determined.
It was revealed earlier this week that
the next cover of the magazine, drawn
by one of the columnists of Charlie
Hebdo, Zineb El Rhazoui, will feature
the prophet Mohammed again, this
time holding a sign reading “Je Suis
Charlie” and announcing forgiveness
for the terrorists that all but wiped
out the editorial team of the small
magazine.
“We don’t feel any hate to them.
We know that the struggle is not with
them as people, but the struggle is
with an ideology,” she told BBC Radio
4’s Today programme.
The issue will be hitting stands
in London today, with the South
Kensington Bookstore opening at
8.15am and limiting copy sales to one
issue per person.
At the time of print, people are
already queuing outside venues
across London, although there will
only be 2,000 copies of this new issue
available in the entirety of the UK.
In total, 3 million copies of this issue
have been printed as opposed to
their average circulation of 60,000,
defiantly proving that even after the
mindless slaughter of their editorial
team, the magazine simply cannot be
stopped.
