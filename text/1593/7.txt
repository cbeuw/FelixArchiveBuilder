Care for a legal high that’s
“Chaperon-ed by Imperial”?
It might sound Nutt-s, but development is underway. Philippa Skett reports
Imperial Professor David Nutt has
begun research on a legal high
that mimics ecstasy but may also
stop binge drinking. The drug, known
as Chaperon, is still being developed
but could one day be available as a
cocktail in bars across the country.
The idea of Chaperon occurred
around a year ago to the anonymous
Dr. Z, a mathematician who
previously created mephedrone.
Chaperon is the trade name for
MEAI, or 5-methoxy-2-aminoindane.
MEAI simultaneously invokes a
chemical pleasure in those that
take it and also makes alcohol seem
repulsive, inhibiting consumption.
Dr. Z and Nutt hope that the drug
could be taken to mitigate binge
drinking but also deliver a relaxing
high, described by some as an “intense
euphoria.”
Dr. Z initially planned for MEAI to
be sold as yet another legal high, but
has now gifted the provisional patent
of MEAI and a number of other
chemically similar compounds to
Professor Nutt’s charitable research
group, DrugScience.org.uk.
This family of compounds is
not particularly novel: they were
discovered around 20 years ago as a
means to treat depression. Although
they are proven to have neurological
effects, the idea to use these
compounds to combat binge drinking
is new however and something Nutt
and his team are keen to develop.
MEAI has shown the most promise
so far, so research is now underway to
determine optimum doses, discover
any potential side effects and look at
the safest way for people to consume
the drug and benefit from its
influence.
Felix spoke to Nutt, who told us
how the idea to address and reduce
the harmful effects of alcohol is
nothing new, but the direction in
which to approach this is constantly
evolving.
Nutt told us: “We could develop
an alternative or look to produce a
substance that moderates the effect
of alcohol. I found that it is difficult
to find alternatives to alcohol, so we
need something that moderates it
instead.
Chaperon can be taken with
alcohol as opposed to substituting
it completely. It will hopefully
minimise the harm, maximise
the pleasure and limit the alcohol
consumption.”
So how long will it be before this
wonder drug hits bars and pubs?
Nutt plans to ensure that the social
culture surrounding sensible alcohol
consumption is maintained, telling
Felix that still wants to keep people
in bars, and would prefer the drug
to be served as a cocktail in an more
up-market bar. “I want it to appeal to
people who care about their health
and pleasure, but want to reduce the
harm of drinking too.
“I want to put drinking back into
clubs; too much drinking goes on
outside this drinking environment.
I would really only want Chaperon
available in licensed premises, not
something that people sit in front of
the television swigging!”
Although the patent is provisional,
with enough research and funding
the drug could be issued a complete
patent that will then last a further
ten years and allow for the drug to be
developed for commercial sales.
Clinical and human trials of the
drug have yet to be conducted under
controlled conditions, all of which
are dependant on more investors
sitting up and taking notice. With
the different stages of development
needed for drugs being expensive
and lengthy, the cost will no doubt
be high but there is no total figure on
how much it will take to get MEAI
out of labs into bars as of yet.
Finally, we asked Nutt if he had
tried MEAI himself. “Of course I
have!” he chuckled. “It’s a lot like
alcohol; it’s relaxing and pleasant but
it doesn’t make you want to drink
more. I haven’t tried it with alcohol,
but will do so once we’ve pinpointed a
dosage that works.”
So how long could it be before
we order Chaperon instead of
Chardonnay? Concluded Nutt: “The
bottom line is whoever puts money
on the table determines whether
or not this happens, but I’m very
optimistic and excited to see how our
research develops.”
