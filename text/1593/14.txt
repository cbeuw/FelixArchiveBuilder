"This will be
extremely
valuable
for correct
future
diagnosis
and
treatment."
Genetic mutations that lie
behind a common type of
heart disease have been
identified by researchers at Imperial,
laying the foundations for better
treatments and more accurate
diagnosis of a serious and often fatal
condition.
Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM) is
a degenerative disorder that causes
the heart to become enlarged and
unable to beat properly, often leading
to heart failure and sudden death. It
is believed to affect about 1 in 250
people, and causes over 10,000 deaths
every year in the US.
Unlike the most common form
of heart disease, which is caused by
narrowing of the coronary arteries
due to a build-up of cholesterol, DCM
is often hereditary and typically
affects younger people, with most
sufferers aged between 20 and 60.
It has historically had a very poor
prognosis, although new drugs and
other treatments have improved
patient outcomes in the last 10 years.
In many people with DCM, a key
protein in heart muscle called titin is
shorter than it should be. Mutations
in the gene that codes for titin are
very common, causing shortening
of the protein in about 2% of the
population. The vast majority of
people with shortened titin have no
symptoms of DCM. The reason for
this difference is unknown.
Titin is also an extremely large
protein, more than a micrometre in
length, made up of almost 35,000
amino acids. These factors have
made it difficult to identify harmful
mutations and establish a genetic test
for the condition.
Scientists at Imperial and the Royal
Brompton hospital sequenced the
gene in 5000 people, and determined
the location of mutations in the
genes of healthy patients and those
with DCM. This data enabled them
to identify exactly which types of
mutation are harmful and which are
not.
The study, published in the journal
Science Translational Medicine, could
allow relatives of sufferers to find
out if they too will develop DCM,
assisting earlier diagnosis and
improving treatment outcomes.
According to Professor Jeremy
Pearson, Associate Medical Director
at the British Heart Foundation,
“This study defines, for the first
time, a comprehensive list of
mutations in the titin gene, which
of these are associated with dilated
cardiomyopathy, and which are
harmless. This information will be
extremely valuable for correct future
diagnosis and treatment as we enter
an era when many people’s genes will
be sequenced”.

Athresher shark has been
recorded giving birth in
the wild for the first time.
The photograph was taken in
2013 by marine biologists from
the University of Chester on an
expedition to Monad Shoal in the
Philippines.
The researchers were observing the
shark at cleaning station, where small
creatures such as shrimp remove
parasites from the bodies of larger
animals. They noticed that she was
becoming agitated but didn’t realise
why until they analysed the data.
The remarkable photo shows
a pup emerging from the shark’s
cloaca. Published in the journal
Coral Reefs, the image sheds light
on the reproductive behaviour of
oceanic species, which remain largely
unknown.
