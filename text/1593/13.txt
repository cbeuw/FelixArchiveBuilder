ups and downs of being an entrepreneur
new outfits at a fraction of the price
that the clothes would look better if
the items were photographed on a
model, so with our limited resources
we began taking it in turns to try on
all the items. Caroline was responsible
for sizes 4-6, whilst I handled sizes
8-16. It was a ridiculous situation
and there were moments, wading
knee deep through other girls’
dresses, when we did question if we
had made the right decision. But we
had promised our customers that
the shop would open at the end of
the month, and had no choice but to
barrel forwards. Once all the items
had been photographed, we realised
that our pictures needed serious
editing, so spent an intense night on
Photoshop. For the online shop, we
used e-commerce platform Shopify.
After uploading all our products,
we held our breath and launched.
This was a defining moment, as we
would see if customers would actually
transact money. To our delight,
within seconds of the launch, girls
started to spend their credit. We had
warned everyone in advance that they
would need to be quick to snap up the
best items, but we didn’t imagine that
most girls were poised for attack! One
customer informed us later that it
had been ‘an exhilarating experience!’
And exhilarating it was us too, as
we spent the rest of the night before
graduation watching items being sold
out, screaming with excitement at
each other down the phone until we
were hoarse.
Once we had dispatched all the
orders, we organised another meeting
with Alice and her co-founder Matt.
She told us that we had taken on her
challenge somewhat more literally
than she was expecting, but was
impressed with what we had achieved,
and decided to accept us onto this
year’s EF accelerator programme!
The programme culminates in a
Demo Day, which is a chance to
raise a round of seed investment –
our next challenge! We have been
working with the support of EF for
a month now, and have recently
begun refreshing the stock in our
shop once every week on Sundays at
9pm. Our working days are still very
surreal – meetings with advisors
interspersed with zipping around
London for collections, promoting,
photographing, editing etc. Life really
does seem stranger than fiction now,
as fiction must oblige by the rules.
But we’ve found great reward by not
following expectations and rules –
neither of us can believe that this is
our real job, and are excited to further
our business. If you would like to

We are now bringing Clotho to UK
universities– we will be collecting
and delivering clothes from central
campus locations. We are kicking
things off on our home turf at
Imperial and will be doing our first
Univeristy collection here next week.
We will be collecting clothes in the
Sherfield Building from 12-2pm 22nd
Tuesday – 24th
Thursday January.
If you are a girl then have a
rummage through your wardrobe
over the weekend, bring along some
items that you no longer wear and
get credit to spend in our online shop
next Sunday!
"Neither
of us can
believe that
this is our
real job"
"Textiles
are in the
top five
landfill
materials
that can be
recycled."
