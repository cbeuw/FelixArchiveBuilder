Shutterbug-gered: legal action may
be sought against Imperial students
Aphoto booth hire service is
considering further legal
action after incurring
damages to its equipment during the
joint RCSU-CGCU Winter Ball in
early December last year.
Felix was told that the RCSU,
who made the hire arrangement
on behalf of the joint organizing
committee, had paid the cost of the
equipment damages in full upfront to
Unlock Photo Booth after the night.
A representative from the RCSU
had said that Unlock Photo Booth
had subsequently confirmed that
payment was received. Unlock also
“provided a photo of the culprits”
it alleges were involved, with the
RCSU turning over these names to
Imperial College Union for further
investigation.
However Unlock Photo Booth has
since implied that this payment is
now insufficient, saying that the
losses suffered now include “the
cancellation of 2 events as a result
of the damage sustained. These
cancellations not only took a huge
financial toll on our business, but
were also extremely detrimental to
our reputation.”
In an email to Felix, Patrick from
Unlock goes on to say: “As I am sure
you can understand, I am disgusted
by the student’s actions, and we will
not tolerate malicious damage to
our equipment, as such actions are
illegal.“
RCSU President Serena Yuen
provided the following statement to
Felix: “I can confirm that the RCSU
has paid for the costs of damage,
and several individuals have been
identified to the Union who are now
dealing with this matter instead of us.
Naturally we are disappointed that
an incident took place, but we are
working closely with the Union to get
to the bottom of this. ”
ICU have confirmed with Felix that
its investigation on the matter is still
under way, and has since resumed
having being briefly suspended over
the Christmas term holidays. They
are also currently reviewing the
claimed loss figures with Unlock
Photo Booth, and have said that the
alleged culprits have been extremely
cooperative throughout the
investigation.

These Aero-smiths didn’t want to miss a thing
Undergraduate aeronautical
students were given a
postgraduate exam paper to
sit this week, with no-one realising
until the end of the exam the mistake
that was made.
Third year, fourth year and
postgraduate students sat their
Computational Fluid Dynamics
(CFD) exams on Monday, with
undergraduates and postgraduates
seated in different exam rooms.
Due to an apparent shortage of
papers for the undergraduates in one
of the exam rooms, an invigilator was
sent to get more papers, and brought
two students the exam script only
intended for postgraduate cohort.
With the papers having the same
module title and being of identical
duration, the students didn’t realise
the error initially until it was too late.
They turned in their scripts once the
exam had finished, and have been
told that they will be marked and
graded with the other papers.
Sources from the aeronautics
department have told Felix that
the papers covered different CFD
material, although the module
content is exactly the same. The
postgraduate paper allegedly covered
more theoretical derivations than the
undergraduate equivalent, although
the department stated that the exams
were apparently of similar difficulty.
Postgraduates and undergraduates
are taught the same modules
independently throughout the year.
The department told us that this is
because of space constraints and also
to limit class sizes.
When contacted, the Aeronautics
admin team told Felix that the mix-
up was “a simple human error,” and
that the students would be offered
the marks of the paper they sat,
but could re-sit the module if they
were unhappy with the results. “Be
reassured we are doing everything
to assist them so that they are not
disadvantaged in any way.”
Felix spoke to one of the students
involved, and said that he thought
the department had handled the
mix-up satisfactorily but that he
would probably be re-sitting the exam
after all. “I don’t know if it was hard
because it was a different paper or
just because I hadn’t revised! But I
think the department is dealing with
it well.”
Pascal Loose, Deputy President
(Education) told Felix: “It is a very
unfortunate incident, however the
department’s immediate response
is very positive. We will be working
with our Academic Reps to make
sure that, if necessary, mitigating
circumstances for these students are
considered. Imperial College Union
is committed to working with the
College to ensure that the education
our members receive is world-
leading.”
"We are
working
closely
with the
Union to
get to the
bottom of
this"
...but they ended up doing so anyway. Philippa Skett reports on an exam gaffe
