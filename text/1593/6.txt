An increase of the Amenities
fund from £1.50 to £2.00
per person per week has
been recommended by Imperial
College Union. The recommendation
was made as part of the Student
Amenities Fund Review, and was
presented to Union Council on
Tuesday by the Union President, Tom
Wheeler.
The recommendations came from a
survey taken by current hall seniors,
hall committees and the Wardening
Teams. The majority of the responses
suggested that a budget of £2 per
person per week would be preferable
to the current allocation of £1.50 set
at the beginning of this year.
The Amenities fund, used by halls
to run events and socials for students,
was slashed at the beginning of the
academic year to a flat rate of £1.50
per student per week, sparking
outrage from wardens and hall
seniors.
£1 of this was paid for directly
by this year’s freshers cohort rent,
whilst the College paid for the
remaining 50p, making £152,190 in
total available for all students for all
activities in the coming year.
However, next year the College will
withdraw their contribution, meaning
students will be paying double into
the amenities fund compared to what
students are paying this year.
The slash in funds amounted to a
decrease of approximately £150,000
when compared to last year’s figures.
College were unable to explain where
this £150,000 has disappeared to
when Felix investigated the changes
to the fund last term (Issue 1584),
although it may have not been
explicitly documented in the first
place.
Wheeler told Council that due to
the incredibly large sum of money
taken each year through rent alone,
this £150,000 difference may not
have been specifically documented.
He also told Council that although
around £15.5 million is collected each
year from rent, the Union does not
know how exactly the rent prices were
previously calculated.
However Wheeler was keen to stress
the importance of transparency, and
said he wants students to understand
exactly what they are paying for in
the future. If the recommendations
are put into practice, students will
receive an invoice for their student
accommodation at the start of the
year that will show the costs of
their rent, and also the separate
compulsory payment to the amenities
fund.
The funds are now managed
through eActivities, with hall
committees functioning similar to
a club or society and the amenities
funds paid directly to the Union at
the beginning of the year. Wheeler
countered the argument that halls
could potentially underspend one
year and have funds carried over
for use by the next intake by setting
spending timelines and ensuring that
halls are on target. This will hopefully
ensure that the money paid for by
one cohort will not be rolled over and
spent the next year.
One current hall senior explained
to Felix that the cut in the funds this
year have had the opposite effect the
college may have hoped it would have
in the first place. He told us: “I think
that College has this idea that events
that cater to students who drink
exclude those that don’t.
“However, with the reduction in
amenities fund this year, events that
are the easiest and cheapest to run
are those that involve alcohol and we
have actually seen that the events that
don’t are the first to go because of the
higher cost.
“It is so much easier to order a load
of alcohol for a social in the common
room over trips to the theatre or
abroad that cost more money; money
thanks to the slashes in the fund we
don’t really have now.”
Hall seniors however remained

sceptical of the recommendations
to improve transparency. “The
argument that they are increasing
transparency by separating the fund
from rent is just another way for
college to pretend they are trying
to reduce costs whilst really looking
after their own profit margin.”
The review also recommended a
review of the eActivities system to
improve the “speed and usability of
the interface,” something that will no
doubt be well-received by any student
involved in the administration of
clubs and societies.
The Union is paid approximately
£10,000 by the college to review the
Amenities fund for the Amenities
Fund Review Group, a panel
consisting of Imperial College Union
Staff, Sabbaticals, and College staff
including Debra Humphris, the
Vice Provost of Education. The
review will then be considered by
the Vice Provost Advisory Group for
Education, a board within college that
oversees the running of halls amongst
other things.
Tom Wheeler spoke to Felix after
council about the recommendations.
“We are really pleased that the future
First Council of the year fails to meet quorum
Union Council met on Tuesday
for the first time this year,
although with attendance
being so low was unable to meet
quorum. This means that there
weren’t enough students present
to allow any papers to pass and any
decisions to be made. Email votes are
taking place instead on the papers
discussed.
Students present at Council casted
votes on the papers out of interest,
although the votes were more so to
gauge opinion and were not officially
recorded.
Papers presented included the
recommendations for changes to
the Amenities funds, a proposal for
annual general meetings, suggestions
to reallocate the functions of the
now defunct executive committee,
and also whether or not the votes of
individual council members should
be recorded and then published.
The idea of publishing the votes of
named individuals has proven to be
a contentious issue; although those
present rhetorically voted in favour
of publishing the choices made by
elected representatives, it has not
been a popular opinion in the past.
With the Union having invested
£2,000 for electronic voting pads,
they are already able to record which
member voted in favour of or against
any paper. However, some people
have previously voiced displeasure of
the idea of their being a permanent
record of voting decisions. Said one
Council member, “If that motion
passes, I’m just going to abstain from
everything.”
Some students suggested that it

would make council members think
more about their vote before they
cast it, but also that some topics could
still be voted on anonymously on an
ad hoc basis.
Email votes have to be cast by
the 16th of January by all council
members on these papers, not just
those who were not present.
Paul Beaumont, Council Chair,
spoke to Felix about the importance
of attending Council. Said Paul: “I
can completely understand that at
busy times of the year for students, it
will be difficult for Council to reach
quorum (January exams being a
details of the Amenities Fund, now
named Hall Activities Fund, will be
decided yearly by feedback from the
students that have administered it
that year.
We had a really great discussion
about the recommendations in
Union Council and we look forward
to seeing those changes put in place
next year.”
Debra Humphris also spoke to
Felix about the recommendations.
Said Debra: “It’s been really helpful
to receive feedback on the Student
Amenities Fund from Imperial
College Union following their
consultation with students on the
changes put in place last term.
“These changes increased the
transparency and accountability of
the Fund by putting it in the hands
of the students who benefit from it.
It is now fully administered through
the Union’s eActivities system, and
has received additional funding from
the Education Office to support this
process during the transition.
“Putting these decisions into the
hands of students is a really positive
step and I’ll be advising the Provost
board of these changes in March.”
prime example).
“It’s totally understandable that
elected students might have to
miss a meeting or two due to other
commitments. It is a pity that some
members of Council do not attend at
all though.
“Council is the place where
students elect their most senior
representatives to, and for them to
then not use their vote is frankly
confusing to me.
“It seems both a waste of time for
the students who bothered to vote,
and for the people who run for the
positions.”
