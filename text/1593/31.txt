Chris Richardson shares his how-to guide for living and volunteering in the ‘Big Durian’
Volunteer experience: my month with
YBS in Jakarta
Ispent a few weeks working with
the Foundation for Mother and
Child Health – Yayasan Balita
Sehat (YBS) – in Jakarta, and thought
I’d share my experience with any
would-be volunteers out there. Jakarta
is a destination that most avoid
like the plague, but I think that for
seasoned Londoners the downsides
(traffic and crime risk) are tame at
best and offset by the benefits: I met
some brilliant people, did some cool
stuff, and in general had a great time.
It was a solid experience, being in an
interesting place and working for a
useful cause.
Working at YBS
YBS is an NGO focusing on mother
and child health. They’re based
in a small office in Cipete, South
Jakarta. As it’s a relatively small
team, you’ll quickly get to know
names and faces, and everyone is
extremely accommodating. Based
on your experience and interests, the
team will make sure your project is
interesting, enjoyable, and useful.
And they’ll be sure to put your nerdy
Imperial skills to good use.
The main focus of my time was
to run a project on social impact
measurement, looking at the three
main programmes at YBS in order
to assess their effectiveness. This
will be useful for YBS to work as
successfully as possible, and also
allow them to better showcase their
work to sponsors. I developed this
project from the initial research and
designing the study, through to data
collection and analysis, responsibility
I doubt I’d have been given at a
larger organisation. The team were
incredibly helpful throughout the
process, especially when translating
from English to Indonesian, and
interviewing the mothers invited to
participate in the study.
There are also plenty of
opportunities to get involved with
as much as you’d like alongside your
main project. Whilst there I went out
on site to visit beneficiaries in their
homes, as well as visiting a factory
outside of Jakarta to see a health
education session in action. I also ran
a couple of smaller projects on the
side but, most importantly, had fun
spending time with the children who
come to the pre-school every morning
– a much more fulfilling break than
the trivial water cooler chat I’ve
encountered at other offices.
Given that work fills so much of
your day, it’s important that you
enjoy what you do. I loved working
on my project, and have no doubts
that subsequent volunteers will have
similar positive experiences.
Living in Jakarta
I tend to be an open-minded guy
when it comes to travel destinations.
But everyone I spoke to on the road
told me some variation of “don’t
bother with Jakarta”. Twin that
with the city’s nickname – the Big
Durian – and you’re left with some
pretty low expectations. But, perhaps
unsurprisingly, I was pleasantly
surprised. As a tourist, sure, there’s
very little for you here, unless you’re
a big fan of sightseeing. But once
you’re rooted here for more than a
few days, Jakarta starts to get well and
truly into your veins. Let’s quickly
cover the basics:
Accommodation: YBS were
extremely helpful in helping me to
secure a spare room just two minutes’
walk from the office, at $125 (US)
for the month (yes, month). For
that I got a spacious room with a
double bed, en-suite bathroom, and
air conditioning. Mr Halimah and
his family were lovely and ensured
my stay was comfortable. There
are countless host families in the
neighbourhood – just a stone’s
throw from popular expat hangout
Kemang – and all the other amenities
(supermarkets, laundry services,
malls) you could need within a fifteen
minute walk or two minute cab. If
you’d rather opt for something else,
there’s always CouchSurfing, which
we’ll come to now.
Social scene: As soon as you arrive,
get onto CouchSurfing and have a look
for events in Jakarta. At the time
of writing, there’s a hugely popular
Wednesday pub quiz held at de Hooi
in Pondok Indah, with a perfect
blend of locals and expats to keep you
entertained. I went in my first week
and never looked back. From that
initial evening out I made some great
friends and had invitations to more
social events than I could attend: a
weekly indie movie night, a weekly
Sunday fun run, and various one-offs.
My top 3 times are probably catching
a decent DJ from the top floor of a
skyscraper overlooking the city, a
weekend snorkelling trip away to the
Thousand Islands, and a tour of the
Google offices. I cannot stress enough
just how easy CouchSurfing will make
your social life in Jakarta.
Transportation: I’ll admit that I
never got around to taking a local bus.
But that’s because the taxis and ojek
(motorcycle taxis) are so cheap. For
taxis, you’ll want to aim for either
a Blue Bird or Express (2 reliable
companies), and expect to pay $1 (5
minute) to $5 (1 hour) – just wait on
the street and flag one down. Ojek
should be easily spotted by their
signposts, but if you’re stuck just ask
the nearest local and they’ll point you
in the right direction – remember to
ask a friend roughly what to pay, and
negotiate the price with the driver

before you hop on. In general, taxis
are nicer for longer journeys or if
there’s rain brewing. Ojek, on the
other hand, are perfect during rush
hour, as they can weave through the
cars and get you to your destination
in a fraction of the time.
Food: Jakarta caters for all price
brackets – from $0.50 street snacks
through to decent restaurants that’ll
still set you back less than $10
for a main. I got into the habit of
stocking up on breakfast from the
supermarket, grabbing lunch from
a nearby local restaurant ($1), and
then heading out with friends for
dinner in the evening. There are so
many dishes to try: nasi goreng (fried
rice), rendang padang (beef curry),
and sate (grilled meat skewers) will
become your staples, always served
alongside a hearty dollop of fiery
sambal (chilli sauce). But there’s also
the multinational names you see
everywhere, but at a fraction of the
cost you’re probably used to – a large
Domino’s pizza will set you back
about $3.50.
So I think that just about covers
it. Overall I loved my project at YBS
and made some brilliant friends in
Jakarta who I hope to keep in contact
with for a long time. The experience
was a fantastic one that I would
recommend to anybody: Jakarta is
a happening city and YBS is a cause
worth being a part of. Use the above
as a guideline, but I’m sure if you
stitch together various sources with
some information on the ground,
you’ll find the perfect blend of things
to keep you entertained.
