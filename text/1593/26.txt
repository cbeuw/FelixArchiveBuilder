Liberian Girl @ The Royal Court
This tells the story of a teenage girl’s
survival in her country’s civil war, in
the face of unfathomable evil. This
production scares me; it is a standing
performance, immersive and
intimate, a straight 95 minutes with
no intervals, the kind of performance
Another production at the Royal
Court, Fireworks (Al’ab Nariya)
follows a similar theme. It tells the
story of two Palestinian children

How does a child conceptualise war
and death? What is it like to live in
these circumstances? This play looks
The Rise and Shine of Comrade Fiasco @
The Gate Theatre
Finally, a play about Zimbabwe’s

Multitudes at the Tricycle Theatre.
Islam, British identity, immigration
and military intervention in the
Middle East, the play explores the
different ways British muslims
make sense of the world they live in
and gives insight into their sense of
that forces you to confront the
issues raised. And when the issues
include death, sexual violence and the
distortion of a child soldier’s mind,
you can only leave a changed man.
