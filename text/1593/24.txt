the Whitechapel Gallery
as they take an abstract
adventure through the ages.
Black
Squares: A
Century of
Celebration,
Triumph,
and Tears
It’s not really a square. That’s
my first impression when faced
with Black Square, the Kazimir
Malevich work from 1915 that starts
off the Whitechapel Gallery’s
retrospective of abstract art. It’s more
like a slightly squished rectangle, and
after all the hype, it’s actually pretty
small. However, its size belies the
huge impact that this little artistic
gesture has had on modern society;
over the last hundred years the
black square has gambolled through
Europe, zipped along the highways
of America, and spread its influence
across the entire globe. The title of
the exhibition – The Adventures of the
Black Square – is therefore fitting; we
are invited to join this unassuming
canvas as it charts a novel path into a
bright, uncertain future.
We begin with four key artists,
who were producing work in the
1910s and 20s, introducing us to
the main themes running through
this retrospective; Lyubov Popova,
the Soviet constructivist whose
work represents the intersection
between abstract art and the built
environment, catchily termed
Architectonics; Gustav Klutsis’
abstracted illustrations of
loudspeakers, influenced by the
increasingly complex world of
communication; Sophie Taeuber-
Arp, whose textile work reveals
the innumerable ways abstract art
infiltrated everyday life; and finally
Kazimir Malevich, whose black
square became a null void, sweeping
away the conventions of art history,
making way for a new vision of a
modern utopia.
Even within these four works,
a myriad of themes emerge, all of
which are explored throughout
the exhibition. The curators have
made sure not to place one type of
work above the other, and there is
no hierarchy of medium; thus Anni
Albers’ geometric textile work,
representing the pinnacle of Bauhaus
arts, sit happily alongside Lebanese
modernist Saloua Raouda Choucair’s
rarely seen sculptures, which face
a wall of Alexander Rodchenko’s
dramatic photography. The works
may seem disparate when seen apart,
but the Whitechapel manages to show
that all have been touched by the
magic of Malevich’s utopian ideals.
This huge range of material is best
shown by the work of the American
abstract artists working in New York
in the 1960s: Dan Flavin’s neon
piece ‘Monument’ for V Tatlin can be
viewed whilst walking over the giant
lead blocks of Carl Andre’s 10 x 10
Altstadt Lead Square. Steel and neon.
Lead and glass. This celebration of
modernity is a direct descendent of
early abstract photographers like
László Moholy-Nagy and Alexander
Rodchenko, whose dynamic images
of pylons, typewriters, and machinery
transform mechanisation into an
aesthetic virtue. It also forms a
counterpoint to those who feel that
abstraction is all about objectivity
and coldness; Flavin and Andre are
following in the footsteps of early
constructivists like Vladimir Tatlin,
for whom materiality and non-
objectivity were the focal points of
modernism.
The key historical marker from
which Whitechapel take their cue is
Petrograd’s 0.10 exhibition of 1915,
in which ten key artists displayed
their vision of the future, among
them Malevich, Popova, and Tatlin.
This started a boom of abstract
art that would spread around
the world like wildfire. With the
movement’s emphasis on objectivity
and abstraction, a new means of
communication was formed through
the use of manifestos and artistic
publications, a huge number of which
are on display here.
Unlike some other exhibitions,
these are not useful for mere
historical reference, but are works
of art in themselves, exemplifying
the modernist emphasis on graphic
design and typography that came to
a head with Moholy-Nagy’s work on
‘typophotos’. The space left behind
by cutting out all unnecessary detail,
leaving behind only line and colour,
has been filled with ideas, texts, and
debate, creating a new visual lexicon
of artistic theory.
These ideas were not only spread
through texts, but also through
teaching, a process which is captured
beautifully by the gallery; the first
area of teaching we encounter is the
Bauhaus, that veritable behemoth of
early modernism. As fascism became
more and more powerful, artists such
as Anni and Josef Albers moved to
New York, where they taught students
from all over the world. Thus we have
exposure to a whole globe of artists,
shattering the myth that abstraction
was solely a Western phenomenon;
from Argentina we have Tomás
Maldonado’s bright minimalism;
from Israel come Zvi Goldstein’s
tableaus inspired by the iconography
of communication; and from Iran we
"Over
the last
100 years
the black
square has
gambolled
through
Europe."
