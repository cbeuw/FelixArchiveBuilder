36 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX

HANGMAN hangman@imperial.ac.uk
Student actually prepared
for post-Christmas exams
As the last greasy drops of
festive cheer are inexorably
wrung from the common
Imperial student, Hangman took
a brief moment this week to glean
superior knowledge from that most
rare of beasts - a student thoroughly
prepared for their post-Christmas
examinations:
“I wouldn’t say I’m arrogant, but
I’m successful in literally everything I
do.“ So says third year biology student
Sergey Van Hamme, whose current
position of choice is lounging on a
cream Chaise Longue in his Fulham
riverside penthouse.
“Everybody keeps complaining
about how hard these exams are,
especially following a festive break.
I just don’t understand why, and it’s
not because I’m the best student in
the year.”
So what’s the secret? What drives
this incandescent prodigy to be the
best? Nothing, apparently: “To be fair,
I don’t even need to revise. You know
those horrifically irritating people
who do next to no work, but end up
top of the class? They’re entirely
below me.”
But it’s not all about thoroughly
undeserved top grades; Sergey has a
life too!
Keen to emphasise his “patrician”
taste in film, he praises recent
Benedict Cumberbatch hit The
Imitation Game as “the funniest
comedy of the year.”
“What made the humour so on
point was the way in which this guy
kept on struggling and struggling to
break this big code. Clearly, if it was
real life, all you’d need is a couple of
hours with a pencil, some paper, a
bottle of Cava and some Beethoven
on the radio. God knows I’ve cracked
harder – and easier! Like these
exams.”
Next up for Sergey? “A
departmental award, obviously. I’m
a modest guy, but my limitless talent
deserves the sincerest adoration.“
It’s not all fun and games for the
savant, conceding that envious rivals
are always around the corner.
“This ingrate who doesn’t even
have the vaguest understanding of
N-terminal myristoylation sites in
plant proteins said that he wanted to
break my nose last week.
So I turned around and told him
that I hoped he got hit by a bus – a
bus of knowledge and intelligence,
that is.”
An anonymous student has
bravely decided to sacrifice
his revision time over the
Christmas holidays to run a Facebook
page for Imperial students, despite
having three final year exams to
tackle later on this week.
The page, Imperial Humans Tell
Someone in the Central Library their
Secrets about the Fourth Floor, has
over twenty posts detailing various
anecdotes, worries and shameful
secrets from Imperial students, all
submitted via an anonymous Google
doc set up by our hero.
Not only that, this valiant figure
has decided to remain anonymous
too, despite numerous people
calling for his identity to be
revealed. However, Hangman can
exclusively announce that this elusive
engineering student has granted us
an interview, to really find out what
makes this admin tick.
We met up with him in the Central
Library café, where he was slunk low
down at one of the desks, his black
Number of Imperial
students who take the bus
increases by 4600%
This Tuesday, industrial action
by the trade union Unite saw a
huge upswing in the proportion
of university students who take the
bus.
Exam officers in every department
currently holding mid-year tests
have been inundated with emails
from bus commuters who were
otherwise completely cut off from
campus.
One first year aero student from
Pembridge Gardens found herself
unable to reach college, with the
industrial action rendering the 52
and 452 busses out of action.
“It was terrible,” she told Hangman
in a coffee shop on Notting Hill Gate,
with Queen’s Tower visible in the
middle-distance over Hyde Park.
“Try as I might there was no possible
way to get to the department in time
for my exams.”
Meanwhile, undergrads in other
years were left to attempt a day’s
experimenting alone across several
faculties. “My lab partner just texted
to say he can’t make it because of the
bus strike,” a third year was quoted
as saying, “which I guess would be
okay, but we live in the same flat. On
Fulham Road.”
fringe obscuring his face. He had a
MacBook open in front of him, and
had already started sorting through
the messages he had received that
day.
“I mean, I just really feel like I am
making a difference,” he told us,
whilst trawling through the Google
document submissions. “People come
to this page to really discuss how they
feel, and I think people appreciate
that.”
He highlighted a post calling out
someone in Beit Hall “a fucking
useless wanker,” and published it to
the page, before taking a bite from
his jacket potato. “People at Imperial
need an outlet where we can be
ourselves, connect as a community,
and maybe share a bit of banter too.”
He shrugged, before dragging
another post into the status bar,
which names and shames some girl in
Wilson who had apparently slept with
numerous people on her corridor.
“I’ve always been a bit distant, elusive,
and separate from Imperial before
now. I’ve never really lived out of
halls before, and in second year I was
failing my degree.”
He toys with removing her name,
whilst continuing with his train
of thought. “I decided to sort my
academic record out, so basically
moved into the library on the fourth
floor. It was then I got the idea for the
page, and it seems to have taken off
since then.”
He pauses, then decides to delete
her name, before adding, “I feel like
people almost trust me, you know?”
He opens the page, and shows us a
previous post, which features a link to
a picture of someone’s faecal matter
in a sink. “People don’t have to hide
who they are anymore.”
He picks a thread from his beige
trench coat absentmindedly as he
tells us how he plans to return home
to Singapore soon, once he graduates.
We ask him what will happen to his
page after, and he tells us of his plans
to continue to run it remotely.
A sly smile crosses his face, and he
leans in. “College tutors can’t get me if
I’m out of the country, you know?”
He re-adds the girl’s name to the
drafted post, pauses, then adds, “Fuck
you, you skank!” before pressing
submit.
He leans back in his chair, and then
muses, “Everyone loves free speech,
eh? People appreciate that we tell the
truth, even if it hurts.”
He collects his notebook, oversized
headphones and camera, and we
shake hands before he leaves to
return to the library. “I would just say,
don’t hate, appreciate, yeah? Bless.”
