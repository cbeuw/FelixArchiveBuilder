Why all the fuss about Charlie Hebdo?
The news over the past week
has been dominated by stories
about the terrorist attacks
in Paris, killing 17 people, with the
satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo
among the targets. Also reported,
but to a far lesser extent, are attacks
by Boko Haram extremists in Baga,
Nigeria, resulting in thousands of
deaths. With all the media interest
focused on Charlie Hebdo and France,
the horrifying events in Nigeria have
somewhat fallen by the wayside. Why
is it the case that these attacks have
received far less media attention, not
just globally, but also in Nigeria itself?
Is it the case that we in the Western
world consider the lives of those lost
in France more valuable and worthy
of attention?
One reason is of course, practicality.
There are thousands of journalists in
France and Paris, within quick and
easy reach of the action. In contrast,
Baga is difficult to access, with very
few international journalists nearby.
While the news story is certainly
more significant in terms of lives lost,
reporting on it is far more perilous.
The attacks in Paris were motivated
by vengeance for satire of the Prophet
Muhammad in the press, and many
publications have been fearful of
repercussions upon reporting on, and
reproducing the original material.
Despite this, the overwhelming
attitude of the media has been of
cautious support for Charlie Hebdo.
While this attack has shown that
the danger is real, the peril of being
on the ground, reporting on the
devastating attacks in Nigeria is on
another scale entirely. With hordes
of extremists roving through villages,
razing them to the ground, and
killing hundreds, even thousands of
innocent people that they encounter,
the risk is far greater.
The attacks in France are more
unique than the latest Boko Haram
attacks. While these carry the
horrifying new aspect of enslaving
little girls to use as suicide bombers,
these acts by Boko Haram have
almost become commonplace,
flooding our newsfeeds every week.
While incidents such as those in
France are not entirely unheard of
– the threat was real enough for the
Charlie Hebdo offices to have police
protection – they are certainly more
unusual, and far more relatable. It
is the complete shock that an office
in a European city could become the
setting for such a tragedy that makes
this story so compelling. We live and
work in places like this and we rarely
doubt our safety. The ease of empathy
leads to a morbid fascination, and the
media reflects this.
The journalists themselves, who
report the news that we read, will
be feeling these attacks personally.
While every journalist is aware of
the risks, the reality is jarring. The
passion of the media itself on this
story will drive the reporting further,
raising it higher.
Political leaders from around
the world have spoken out in
condemnation of the actions of
these terrorists, and in many cases,
travelled to France to participate
in rallies of support. All over the
world, people have been shocked
by these events. The Nigerian
massacres have been treated with
similar revulsion, with many western
world leaders issuing statements of
horror, but the President of Nigeria
himself, Goodluck Jonathan, has
denounced the attacks in Paris but
hasn’t even acknowledged the attacks
in his own country. The Nigerian
government has done little to
contain Boko Haram, and without
this, the seriousness of these attacks
is diminished. The striking sight of
world leaders standing together in
Paris, uniting against a common
cause, is such dramatic imagery; it is
easy to report. In the case of Nigeria,
there are no sweeping statements of
purpose; there is nothing as visually
effective. To put it bluntly, it doesn’t
make such good entertainment,
and that is, ultimately, the main
prerogative of the media.
The Western world isn’t indifferent
to the suffering and slaughter of
Africans. Other similar stories, such
as the kidnapping by Boko Haram of
276 schoolchildren in Nigeria, have
been as high-profile as any Western
tragedy has ever been, and have
struck a chord with people all over
the world. But with the numerous
bombings, shootings, kidnappings,
and enslavements happening at the
hands of Boko Haram in West Africa,
they lack novelty, and people lose
interest. This is natural, of course,
but let us not forget the ongoing
atrocities that are masked by the
latest news. They remain worthy of
our respect and attention, and these
lives lost deserve not to be forgotten.
While we may be morbidly enthralled
with watching events unfold, we
should remember that many people
do not have this luxury, and are being
subjected to other horrors.

COMMENT EDITOR
Paris attacks have recieved widespread global attention, but why?
“Is it the case
that we in the
Western world
consider the
lives of those
lost in France
more valuable
and worthy of
attention?”
"... hordes of
extremists
roving through
villages, razing
them to the
ground"
"In the case
of Nigeria... it
doesn’t make
such good
entertainment"
