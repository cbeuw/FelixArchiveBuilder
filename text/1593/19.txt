the gig extra special. While the energy
did not wane at all, it increased
hugely during the encore which
featured ‘Vlad the Impaler’, during
which another timer appeared.
When it had counted down, Brixton
Academy seemed like it began to
collapse under the pressure of the
crowd jumping.
Then there was ‘L.S.F’ which got
the crowd singing their loudest; they
did not stop singing when they left
Brixton and I was still humming it
when I had returned home and the
next day at University.
1. Arcade Fire at Earls Court
(7th
June)
Arcade Fire were preparing for their
biggest gig sharing a stage with Dolly
Parton headlining the Pyramid
Stage in Glastonbury by playing one
of the last ever shows at Earls Court.
They wanted to prove their naysayers
wrong with a truly great show, not
just a regular concert.
They asked the audience to come in
costume, with a significant amount
doing so – in pirate attire, cow
onesies and even dressed as the band
themselves. The band went in all guns
blazing with ‘Reflektor’ which got
this massive aircraft hanger-esque
building dancing. The sound was
practically perfect for such a tricky
venue to play.
For Arcade Fire it was not just
about the sound; there were things
going on everywhere with a B stage
in the middle of Earls Court, on
which there were male cross-dressing
dancers during ‘We Exist’ that many
did not realise was happening until
near the end of the song.
They took songs from their whole
career from Funeral all the way up to
Reflektor with a good mix from all,
though some would bemoan the lack
of songs from Neon Bible. Early hits

in the set such as ‘Neighborhood #3
(Power Out)’ and ‘Rebellion (Lies)’
got the crowd singing and dancing.
There were mosh pits during ‘Month
of May’ and people on shoulders
throughout, specifically during ‘No
Cars Go’. The crowd was really into it
and so the band gave their all as well.
After the show band member
Will Butler revealed that one of
his fingernails had fallen off when
hitting his drum, breaking it in the
process, during ‘Rebellion (Lies)’; this
shows the dedication of the band that
he continued to play for the rest of
the tour, where someone else may
have cancelled their tour – Morrissey,
I’m looking at you.
During ‘It’s Never Over (Dear
Orpheus)’, Regine was duetting from
the B-stage with Win Butler on the
main stage, over a crowd of 20,000
people and they looked just right into
each others eyes which lead to huge
cheers.
It went
further
than just
being a
concert: it
was a full,
live event
where
many
people were
dancing
and
singing.
This was a moment which could not
be recreated in a smaller venue or at
Glastonbury and this was what was
so special about this moment during
the show. To start their encore, their
bobblehead band appeared on the
second stage playing ‘Helter Skelter’
by the Beatles.
The actual band covered ‘London’
by the Smiths as an homage to
the city in a hugely energetic
performance. With ‘Here Comes
the Night Time’, confetti covered
the whole of Earls Court, which is
huge and so massively impressive.
To finish, they played ‘Wake Up’, an
anthem which showed why Arcade
Fire are so loved.
The reason this concert was the best
of the year is because it went further
than just being a concert: it was a full-
on live event where many people were
dancing and singing, which added so
much more to the show and made it
incredible to experience.
