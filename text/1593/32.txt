Time to beat that homesickness

“I began to
realise that
enduring
homesickness
was not
as good as
adjusting and
coping with
it.”
As this is the second term for
the Welfare section, let’s start
things in a different direction!
As an International student myself,
I’m going to talk about what it’s like
to come study abroad and how I
learned to cope with it. England is a
strange place to live in and while the
experience can be exhilarating, it can
also result in major homesickness.
For those of you who’d never
been away from your home country
before coming to University, the
second term might start with pangs
of homesickness, especially if you’ve
gone home for Christmas and New
Year surrounded by old friends and
family.
This is completely understandable.
I’ve been studying in England for
nine years now and I still find myself
missing my warm home and the local
cuisine in the first week of coming
back here.
But let me tell you from experience
that it does get better and easier.
Though sometimes a certain shift in
perspective will help you get there
faster. I’ll share my experience so
you’ll see what I mean.
I came to study in a boarding school
here when I was thirteen years old
and that was probably the biggest
change in my life at that point. I
was pretty attached to my home in
Phuket, Thailand then, never leaving
home for more than a few weeks at a
time. So when I have to move to an
all-boys boarding school where the
majority of students are British, I call
that a bit of a culture shock.
I was immediately homesick. I
wanted to go back to somewhere I
can speak without an accent and
not be constantly greeted by “So
where are you from again?” or
“Where’s Thailand on the map?”.
Not to mention how I was always the
smallest boy in every class when I was
average height back at home.
Having moved from tropical
Thailand, British weather is another
kind of shock. At first enjoyed the
way steam came out of my mouth
when I spoke, but I soon missed the
boiling sun and rains that didn’t last
for days. I even missed the very air
in Thailand since the dry British air
really irritated my skin.
I did not cope well at all in my first
year abroad. I actually shut myself
in instead of trying to adapt to my
new environment, burying myself
beneath books, games and piles of
international call bills.
Luckily there was another Thai boy
who was having a first year abroad
like me, so I ended up socialising only
with him. It did not take long for my
British classmates to dismiss me as
“that quiet Asian nerd” and forget
about me.
Initially, I preferred that to the
constant attention I got from being
different. But in my second year, I
began to ask about what I was even
doing in England.
Of course, I still think a lot about
when I’m next going home, but
I began to realize that enduring
homesickness was not as good as
adjusting and coping with it.
I knew I would be in England until
the end of high school at least, so I
should do something about being
homesick every moment I spend here.
That was when I began to do
stuff outside of regular classes.
Unfortunately, there were only a few
Thai students in my high school so I
didn’t get to join up with them, but I
did talk to British students and tried
to make friends (albeit much later
than everyone else).
At first, it was awkward as hell, but
I was slowly overtaken by curiosity
and the interactions became more
genuine. Before I knew it, I began
to have friends and a sense that I
belonged there.
Then, after every holiday, on my
flights back to England, I found that
the best cure to homesickness is to
have something to look forward to
in the place far away from home. In
a sense, I feel that it’s about making
that place your new home with a new
group of friends and activities or
societies you can do there to make
you feel that you belong there.
The most difficult part that led me
to snap out of homesickness was the
shift in attitude from “Oh please let
me go home because this place will
never be home” to “This is not home,
but I’m stuck here so might as well try
make it one.”
This is not a conscious switch and
it’s not easy (took me a whole year)
but I think it’s an essential first step
to deal with homesickness.
I should add that there are many
ways to go about it: becoming sociable
or pushing yourself out of your
comfort zone doesn’t have to be a
scary prospect. Find a community
or club where you fit in comfortably
and join that. This can be a hobby
or a group of people from your own
country. It would go miles towards
making you feel that you belong here.
Granted, it would be good to try
something new and go out of your
comfort zone, but for most people
that’s the second step. The first is to
actually settle in somewhere they’ve
never been before and make it
possible to live there.
Dealing with homesickness is a
part of that first step. And once that’s
done and you’re feeling ready, the
joy of trying out new things in a new
country will begin in full force.
If you’re homesick now, don’t
worry. The fun will start as soon as
you’ve made this new place home!
“The most
difficult
part that
led me to
coping with
homesickness
was the shift
in attitude.”
