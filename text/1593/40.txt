Kunal Wagle recaps some of the major stories from the holiday
KP, Southampton and Roger Federer.
What have you missed in sport?
Alot has happened in football
over the Christmas holidays.
From a position of relative
strength, Chelsea drew against
Southampton and lost to Tottenham
to allow Manchester City back into
the title race. After the Tottenham
defeat Chelsea and Manchester
City could in fact only be separated
by alphabetical order. Since then,
though, Chelsea has opened a two-
point gap.
Just behind them in the table
is Southampton, who won at Old
Trafford for the first time in 27 years
to overtake Louis van Gaal’s side
and go third. Manchester United are
now in fourth, two points behind
Southampton, and one ahead of
Arsenal.
The bottom of the table is also
very close, with just three points
separating twelfth placed Everton
and nineteenth placed Queens Park
Rangers. The other two teams in the
relegation zone are Hull City and
Leicester City.
The manager merry-go-round as
already started. Neil Warnock and
Alan Irvine have been sacked and
replaced by Alan Pardew and Tony
Pulis respectively. Newcastle are
currently looking for a manager.
Wilfried Bony has completed a move
to Manchester City from Swansea for
£28m.
Ched Evans is still searching for a
new club to play at after a proposed
deal with Oldham Athletic fell
through. Oldham had contacted
sponsors to inform them that a deal
had been agreed, but reversed their
decision in light of sponsors backing
out and a 40,000 strong petition.
Evans, while still maintaining his
innocence, would later apologise.
The previous day he had released a
statement saying that he blamed ‘mob
rule’ as the talks were terminated.
In cricket, Indian captain
Mahendra Singh Dhoni retired from
Test Match cricket after the third
test against Australia in Melbourne.
Dhoni had played 90 tests in his
career. His replacement as captain,
Virat Kohli, became the first person
to score three centuries in his first
three innings as captain, when he
scored 147 in the fourth test in
Sydney. Australian captain Steve
Smith scored a century in each test
as Australia won the series 2-0 to
reclaim the Border-Gavaskar trophy.
Sacked England batsman Kevin
Pietersen caused a stir during a
commentary stint in the Big Bash
in Australia. Pietersen said “I know
that the current [one-day] captain
would love to have me in the England
team.” He later added: “I want to play
for England. I honestly believe I am
batting as well as I have ever batted at
the moment.”
In tennis, Andy Murray has been
seeded sixth for the Australian Open.
He beat a top-four player for the first
time since the Wimbledon final in
2013 when he thrashed Rafael Nadal
in the semi-final of an exhibition
tournament in Abu Dhabi. He
would go on to win the tournament,
as Novak Djokovic pulled out of
the tournament having fallen ill.
Djokovic then suffered a shock
defeat at the hands of 35-year-old Ivo
Karlovic in the quarter-finals of the
Qatar Open in Doha.
Roger Federer created history when
he secured his 1000th career win on
the ATP tour. The milestone victory
came for Federer in the final of the
Brisbane International. He beat
Milos Raonic in a hard fought match
that went the distance, with Federer
eventually prevailing 6-4 6-7 (2-7) 6-4.
Federer is the third person to reach
the landmark. Jimmy Connors was
the first, while the most recent player
(Ivan Lendl) reached the milestone
in 1992. Federer demonstrated the
immense form he is currently in with
a 39-minute victory over Australian
hopeful James Duckworth in the
quarter-finals. Federer said of the
1000th win: “I’ve played a lot of
tennis over the years so to get to 1,000
wins means a lot to me.
“It’s a special moment, no doubt
about that. I will never forget this
match.”
Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and US Open
Champion Marin Cilic have pulled
out of the Australian Open due to
injuries.
In a light-hearted moment, Serena
Williams, having lost the first set to
Flavia Penneta 6-0 at the Hopman
Cup in Perth, asked the chair umpire
if it was against the rules to have
a coffee. She would later order an
espresso from a ball girl (citing jet lag
as the issue), before going on to win
the match convincingly.
In rugby, Ben Morgan has been
ruled out of the Six Nations with a
broken leg. Saracens lock George
Kruis was cited for a tip tackle and
subsequently banned for three
weeks. He will be available for the Six
Nations.
And finally, Paula Radcliffe has
announced that she will run the
London Marathon in April, but that
it will be her last ever race.
