Taking up a position round the
corner from Angel station in
North London, this theatre
forms one of the centres of London’s
dance scene. Their plans for this
season are set to combine stalwarts of
classical dance with the very freshest
of new talents.
They start off with Plexus (22nd
and 23rd
January; tickets from £12),
a new commission conceived for the
Japanese dancer Kaori Ito, who will -
over the course of an hour - explore
a forest of shimmering strings that
seem to float over the stage.
They then move on to a celebration
of Richard Alston Dance Company
(26th
and 27th
January; tickets
from £12), whose energetic, vivid
choreography has made them one
of the most respected institutions of
contemporary British dance. Taking
on four pieces, this promises to be an
explosion of high-impact dance.
February sees the celebration of
some of Sadler’s Wells’ freshest
talents, when three of their
Associates – Hofesh Shechter, Crystal
Pite, and Kate Prince – take to the
stage to present their latest works (5th
-
8th
February; tickets from £12).
Later in the month sees Wayne
McGregor return to the stage with his
Dance
Jennifer Hayes, Nathan Goodman,
and full Richard Alston Company

The other big daddy of London
dance, the ROH generally
commissions more traditional
work, focussing on ballet and opera.
This season is set to be no exception,
starting off with their production of
Don Quixote (Until 22nd
January; day
tickets available), created by Cuban-
born dancer Carlos Acosta - perhaps
the closest thing the dance world has
to a superstar. This promises to be an
evening of Spanish flair and pasion,
played out across the stage.
We then have something more
classical: John Cranko’s 1965
adaptation of Pushkin’s novel Eugene
Onegin. Onegin (24th
January - 27th
February; tickets from £5) features
a range of different dancing styles,
ranging from sensuous ballet duets to
modern and folk, all set to music by
Tchaikovsky.
The love for Tchaikovsky is
continued into their next centrepiece:
a revival of Swan Lake (10th
February
- 9th
April; tickets from £6). Surely
one of the greatest of classical
ballets, this production uses the
1895 choreography, and features a
wealth of lush costumes reflecting
the opulence of the Imperial Russian
court.
However, it’s not just classical
Royal Opera House
production of Atomos (13th & 14th
February; tickets from £12), which
received a rapturous reception on its
premier in 2013.
Finally, they take a step back
from cutting-edge dance, instead
inviting the English National
Ballet to perform Modern Masters
(10th
- 15th
March; tickets from
£12), a celebration of three of the
20th century’s most influential
choreographers: Jiří Kylián, John
Neumeier and William Forsythe.
This caps off what is set to be a very
exciting season.
Although on after the end of
term, it is worth noting that Sadler’s
Wells will again be welcoming the
Tanztheatre Wuppertal Pina
Bausch, the brainchild of the famed
late German choreographer. After
a decade’s absence their production
of Ahnen (23rd
- 26th
April) is being
revived, along with a piece never
before seen in the UK, Auf dem
Gebirge hat man ein Geschrei gehört
(15th
- 18th
April). While Bausch’s work
has always been hugely popular, the
last couple of years have seen a surge
in interest, and therefore it is highly
likely that these tickets will sell out.
Book early to avoid being let down!
Opera
fare on offer here; February sees
a welcome return of Ballet Black
(10th
- 14th
February; tickets from £8),
who present a dynamic programme
of mixed dances from some of the
world’s leading choreographers.
The company, which is made up of
classically trained black and Asian
dancers, forms a refreshing change
from the stereotypical image of most
ballet companies.
This contemporary theme is
continued in their production of
Draft Works (24th
& 26th
February;
day tickets available), in which the
Royal Ballet perofrm choreography
still in the making. Eschewing the
traditional lighting and costumes,
this should be a stripped back
appraisal of the power of modern
dance.
Finally, we have something much
more provocative from the ensemble
Ballet de Lorraine, who perform
Cover (11th
- 14th
March; tickets
from £5), a new ballet from Israeli
choreographer Itamar Serussi. Set to
music from Berlioz, this production
will tell the tale of a young artist
whose passion for a woman drives
him to euphoria, and eventually to
the edge of madness.
As its name would suggest,
the Royal Opera House is
the place to go for opera in
London. They start this season with
a passionate tale of love, rebellion,
and the French Revolution. Andrea
Chénier (20th
January - 6th
February;
day tickets available) was written by
Umberto Giordant in 1896, and tells
the tale of a young poet’s quest for
love across the barricades.
We then have an opportunity to see
one of the earliest operas by that great
master, Richard Wagner; Der fliegende
Holländer (5th
- 24th
February; day
tickets available) is a dark exploration
of trust and posession. It centres
around The Flying Dutchman, a
cursed man who can only come
ashore every seven years. His only
hope for redemption is in the love of
the beautiful Senta.
This classical theme continues,
with a production of one of the most
well-loved operas of all time: Mozarts
Die Zauberflöte (23rd
February - 11th
March; day tickets available). A firm
favourite amongst opera-goers since
its premier, this mystical story has
found a home in the ROH; don’t
expect many radical reinterpretations
from this version by David McVicar,
Royal Opera House
This season is looking to be an
exceptional one for opera.
The ENO is once again
experimenting with reinventions
of classics with their take on
Wagner’s comedy The Mastersingers
of Nuremburg (7th
February - 10th
March; tickets from £16). It is always
a pleasure to see how truthfully
the ENO manages to conserve
the character of the original work
through translation but in the hands
of critically acclaimed director
Richard Jones, I am sure it will
maintain all the epicness of Wagner’s
score.
ENO follow on with La Traviata
(9th
February - 13th
March; tickets
from £12), Verdi’s epic, in which the
beautifully brittle Violetta is placed
English National Opera
but then again, maybe some things
are better left alone. You are pretty
much guarenteed to have outstanding
singer, incredible costumes, and killer
arias from the Queen of the Night.
If modern opera is more your thing,
you are going to love Bertolt Brecht
and Kurt Weil’s eerily poignant work
Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny
(10th
March - 4th
April) at the Royal
Opera House. A satire on the fickle
nature of consumerism, this opera is
as relevant as ever ninety years after
it was originally produced. Telling
the story of the founding of a city
of consumption and excess and its
eventual decay, you can easily draw
parallels with many of the new cities
emerging in the East.
Finally, we finish the term with
another pillar of the opera world:
Puccini’s Madama Butterfly (20th
March - 11th
April; tickets on sale 27th
January), which spins a wicked tale
of East against West, modern against
classical, tradition against industry.
Centring around the abortive
relationship between an American
soldier and his Japanese bride, we
promise that this will leave you in
tears.
in an untenable position, forced to
defend her lover’s reputation. A tragic
tale of the moral demands society
places on women, it is an opera that
still resonates today.
Their next production also has
a woman at the centre, a rarity in
opera, and one thing that makes The
Indian Queen (26th
February - 14th
March; tickets from £12), on show
at the ENO, so special. A personal
perspective on Europe’s first
encounter with the Mayans in the
New World, director Peter Sellars
has combined Purcell’s score with
new text inspired by Nicaraguan
author Rosario Aguilar, all on a set
designed by LA graffiti artist Gronk
– a blending of art forms that will
guarantee a unique experience.
From the Barbican Centre, we
have the London premiere of
Nicola LeFanu’s opera Tokaido
Road: A Journey after Hiroshige (25th
February; tickets £10, £5 for conces-
sions) performed for one night only.
It’s quite rare for the Barbican Centre
to put on an opera - they are perhaps
better known for their theatre and
dance - but this should be a hot ticket
Barbican Centre
for this season. The work tells the
story of the artist Hiroshige and his
journey along Japan’s ancient Eastern
sea road from Edo to Kyoto. In an
amalgamation of art, music, mime
and poetry, LeFanu has created a
fusion of East and West in what
promises to be possibly the most
interesting opera production on show
this term.
