A Tale of Two Halves from the RSC
Fred Fyles & Kamil McClelland take turns reviewing the
Barbican Centre’s production of Henry IV
The Royal Shakespeare
Company has shown once
again that it defines how
Shakespeare should be performed.
Unusually at the Barbican as
opposed to the Globe, the restraints
of performing in the round were
removed, opening up more options
for staging and props. This allowed
a realistic scene to be set, engrossing
you more fully in this world of
debauchery and rebellion.
I don’t usually find Shakespeare
history plays all that exciting.
Although just as excellent as his other
pieces, they sometimes feel bound in
their creativity by the need for at least
some historical accuracy. And despite
this somewhat being the case here
later on, the performance showed that
it needn’t be so; not for a second did I
feel bored in this gripping portrayal
of the king’s troubled life.
The play tells the story of newly
crowned Henry IV and the many
issues he faces, both personal and
political. From the north comes
opposition from the previous king’s
elected heir, Edmund Mortimer,
as well as from impulsive Harry
‘Hotspur’ Percy. On top of this, the
king must deal with his depraved son
Prince Hal and his band of miscreant
friends from the taverns of Eastcheap.
As opposition bubbles over into open
rebellion, the king must try to reunite
his fractured country as well as his
fractured lineage.
What makes Shakespeare plays so
genius is of course the playwright’s
phenomenal command of the
English language. This was perfectly
accentuated here by stellar acting
performances, especially from
lovingly and poetically inebriated Sir
John Falstaff (Antony Sher). However,
during battle scenes towards the
end of the play, it unfortunately
felt as if the dialogue took more of
a back seat in place of too great an
emphasis on dramatic stage fighting.
Admittedly not entirely the fault
of the production, the beauty of the
language felt overpowered by clichéd
sound effects of clashing swords
and roaring armies. Scenes like this
may have been better at the Globe,
stripped back with a greater purity,
where you cannot hide behind cheap
sound effects and the lyrical mastery
has space to soar.
Thus, I felt the production was
generally extremely good, as one
can always ensure with the Royal
Shakespeare Company and their
excellent troupe of actors. However,
whilst the new setting had its
upsides, some of the simple beauty
of the Globe was muddled amongst
distracting additions.
Sadly, the exciting first half gives
way to a much less nuanced
production of Henry IV Part
II. The set-up is largely where we
left off from Part I; after crushing
one rebellion, King Henry IV must
fend off a second one, led by the
Archbishop of York, whilst also
fighting illness. Prince Hal has
– much to his father’s chagrin –
resumed his philandering with the
aging Falstaff. Beyond this there are a
couple of subplots, although they take
up far more time than is necessary,
meaning that the political intrigue of
the first half is more or less removed.
Instead, we have an increase in bawdy
humour, painted in much broader
strokes by Antony Sher, and while I
understand that Shakespeare can be
difficult to understand at the best of
times, gurning to the audience and
breaking the fourth wall does not a
witty comedy make.
We do have a number of stand-
out performances in this half, none
more compelling than that of Paola
Dionisotti, who plays the Eastcheap
tavern owner Mistress Quickly with
verve and aplomb; stalking the stage
like a sinewy version of Eastenders’
Peggy Mitchell, her impressive
performance has all of us completely
captivated.
Ultimately, this move towards
a more mainstream comedy does
the play a disservice in two ways:
first of all, the scenes are simply
less interesting. Rather than being a
political drama, in which Falstaff is
included as light relief for those who
can’t tell their earls from their dukes,
the second half quite simply becomes
‘The Falstaff Show’, which – although
giving Sher a chance to show off his
obviously considerable acting talent –
does very little to drive the plot along;
we lurch from one Falstaff scene to
another, as the drama is consigned to
the background.
It also means that when drama
does occur it simply feels out of place.
It’s all fun and games with Falstaff,
and then suddenly we are reminded
that there is a bloody war going on,
dragging us into the action abruptly.
The ending of the play is particularly
disappointing; Prince Hal, taking
advice from his father and the Chief
Justice, spurns Falstaff’s advances,
barking at him ‘I know thee not, old
man’. This is supposed to be a crucial
moment of the play, a spine-chilling
reminder of the death of innocence,
and the fickle nature of human
kindness. The preceding action means
that the line has very little impact; it
is tossed aside, like a piece of garbage;
it deserved better.
Henry IV is certainly a difficult
play to put on. The balance between
comedy and drama is a fine line, that
is – as we saw tonight – easy to cross.
While most of the performances were
wonderful, the experience had a weird
disjointed feel, when it should have
flowed like sack from Falstaff’s cup
(but then again, maybe after 5 hours
of theatre anyone would begin to
feel the strain). It is also unfortunate
that Barbican are putting on the
play so shortly after Phyllida Lloyd’s
critically-acclaimed, radically
reinterpreted version of Henry IV
was on at the Donmar Warehouse
and inevitably comparisons will be
made. If you’re a bit of a perfectionist,
who insists on seeing things in
their entirety, then go along to both
parts; just bear in mind that – like
the warring factions of Middle Age
England – the road to unity can be a
bloody one.

Editorial: Looking
Forward, Looking
Back
The new year brings with it an
opportunity for new beginnings:
a chance to plan for the future,to
make new goals,to set out on a path
into a brighter tomorrow.But it’s
also a chance to reflect,to look back
on what has happened over the last
year.This process,of looking back
and looking forward,is central to
the world of art,and the progression
of creativity.
George Santayana said that“those
whocan’trememberthepastare
condemnedtorepeatit”.This may be
true for the vast majority of cases,
but in art those who know the past
are able to learn,be inspired by,and
indeed repeat it.
With that in mind,we spend our
first issue of the year looking
forward to the coming months,and
taking a trip back through artistic
history.We start with a review of
one of Shakespeare’s histories,Henry
IV,which reinterpreted,and was
based on the story of the 15th
century
king of England.Given that there
are two parts,and two arts editors,
we decided to tackle a section each,
giving our differing opinions on
each.
This year sees a very special
anniversary,which seems to have
been overlooked by all but the
Whitechapel Gallery; they celebrate
the centenary of Malevich’s Black
Square,a work that ushered in an
era of abstract modernism,and
changed the artistic world forever.
We let them take us on a journey
through the past century,seeing
how the square has touched all our
lives in a myriad of ways.
A large part of the world of theatre
is looking forward,trying to predict
what is going to be the next big
production,or the next Meryl Streep.
With that in mind,we’ve sent Max
Falkenberg around London to try
and discover the best and brightest
in small theatres.These are plays
that may have slipped through the
net,not having the same publicity
as other,larger productions.As we
see from his reviews,there may be a
reason that this is the case...
We then finish this week’s section
with a term preview of arts,letting
you know what the hot tickets
are going to be in the world of art,
theatre,dance,and opera.With such
a large range of options on offer in
the capital,it can be confusing to
know exactly what to go for; luckily
we can give you a little nudge,
letting you know what is coming
up over the next couple of months.
Onwards and upwards.
