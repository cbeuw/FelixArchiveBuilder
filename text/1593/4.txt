Philippa Skett recaps the tragedy that has captured the
world’s attention, and how it has resonated through the
capital
One city mourns
for another city’s
loss
The world was stunned by the
news last Wednesday, when
two masked gunmen entered
the offices of Charlie Hebdo, a
French satirical magazine. Within
half an hour, twelve people had been
shot dead, including the editor of
the magazine, two policemen and
several cartoonists that had drawn the
“blasphemous” and controversial front
covers.
The gunmen, identified as brothers
Said and Cherif Kouachi, remained
on the run for a further two days,
eventually holing themselves up
in an industrial warehouse, before
being shot dead by policemen
storming the site. Another gunman,
operating in the South of France, was
also shot dead the same day, after
holding shoppers hostage at a kosher
supermarket.
Four of the hostages were also
killed, marking the end of three days
of terror that has been said to be
the worst France has experienced in
decades.
As it all unfolded live through social
media and the news, people wanted
to discuss little else. #JeSuisCharlie,
a hashtag used to express solidarity
with the publication was tweeted
over five million times. It remained
trending on twitter in London for
the next two days as people discussed
the attack, shared the cartoons that
were found so offensive and talked
about what this said about the right
(or privilege, as some would argue) of
free speech.
That evening people flocked to
Trafalgar Square in their hundreds,
singing La Marseillaise, France’s
national anthem and holding up pens,
pencils and in the case of one person,
an apple keyboard. The elevation of a
pen became a symbol of support for
the publication, a trend that swept
Europe and was seen at the many
other rallies that gathered throughout
the evening.
The Guardian put together an
impromptu #GuardianLive panel
discussion for the following evening,
with journalists and cartoonists
alike coming together to discuss
the events. They also discussed the
implications the attack could have
on writers, small magazines right up
the national press across the country.
Felix went along to follow the
debate, and listened as people spoke
of free speech, the role of comics in
newspapers and just what the point of
a cartoon is.
They also discussed at length just
what people could do to support
the magazine. With many online
posting the incriminating cartoons,
newspapers were loath to follow suit.
Many preferred to illustrate their
front covers with an image of one of
the policemen being shot, over the
line drawings depicting the Prophet
Mohammad.
Editors present cited that they were
adhering to editorial policies that
prohibit portrayals of the Prophet.
Others suggested that those who are
responsible for smaller publications
should not make a decision that
could also put their editorial team
in danger. This was eerily prophetic:
last Sunday, Hamberger Morgenpost,
a German newspaper, suffered from
an Arson attack after reprinting the
cartoon. No-one was injured but
two people have been arrested on
suspicion of carrying out the attack.
Some said sharing the “insulting”
cartoons doesn’t do any favours,
but instead people should take out
subscriptions to the magazine, or
donate money. Alan Rusbridger,
Editor in Chief of the Guardian,
announced that the Guardian
Media Group has pledged £100,000
to support Charlie Hebdo, an
declaration that was greeted with a
round of applause.
Sunny Hundal, one of the
journalists on the panel, summed up
that free speech is a two way street:
“ Why is it so difficult for liberals to
persuade Muslims that free speech
is also for them? Free speech is
important for both those who wish to
criticise religion and those who wish
to practise religion too.”
However, others were quick to
point out there is a thin line between
satire and blasphemy, although who
determines where this line is drawn
is also a contentious issue. The debate
was impassioned, eye opening and
informative: a silver lining of the
otherwise dark cloud that had settled
over journalism in the previous 24
hours.
That’s not to say everyone has
been supporting of the magazine. A
coffee shop owner in Brick Lane has
faced death threats over their “Je suis
Charlie” sign outside their café. Adel
Defilaux, a French-born Muslim,
was confronted by an intruder
demanding he remove the sign,
stating that the cartoonists “deserved
to die for what they did.”
Police are now investigating the
matter, but Defilaux has not let this
deter him from showing his support
for the magazine. “I feel weak by
myself with my little café trying to
fight against him but I won’t let him
do what he wants. I’m a Muslim like
him and if I want to support Charlie
Hebdo I will do it. I don’t want to let
him win.”
On Sunday, Trafalgar Square played
host to a Unity Rally attended by
the French Ambassador for the UK,
Sylvie Bermann. Trafalgar Square,
The National Gallery the London
Eye and the Tower Bridge were also
illuminated by the colours of the
French flag.

Felix what it was like to be part of
the rally: “There was quite a sombre
atmosphere with some people holding
candles and others signs with “Je suis
Charlie” on.
“One corner of Trafalgar Square
was closed off for the media satellite
vans, with the reporters going around
interviewing people. In front of the
National Gallery was a quite moving
collection of flowers, posters and
pens.
“There was quite a crowd of
people surrounding the display, and
occasionally someone would step
forward and light a candle or drop
off a pen or pencil. It was also quite
