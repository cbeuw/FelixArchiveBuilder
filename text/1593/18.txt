Aiden Langan reviews the show stoppers of the
last year that have graced the capital with their
mind-blowing gigs
The headline acts
of 2014
Looking back at 2014 there
have been some incredible live
shows by many artists from
Kate Bush returning to perform at
the Hammersmith Apollo after 35
years away to metal being represented
at Glastonbury Festival for the first
time with Metallica headlining the
Pyramid Stage.
I have had some personal highlights
this year in terms of concerts and I
will be ranking my top five concerts
that I have gone to in London (and
not of this year in general, otherwise
Kate Bush probably would probably
be in this list).
5. Damon Albarn at the Royal
Albert Hall (16th
November)
In April Damon Albarn, of Blur
and Gorillaz fame, released his first
solo album Everyday Robots. While
I enjoyed this record, it was not the
easiest album to just listen to. This
was a worry that I had going to this
concert; would it just be a lot of solo
stuff and very few fan-pleasing Blur
and Gorillaz hits? Luckily, Albarn did
neither of these. His set contained 25
songs in total and only 8 of these were
from the solo album but he included
all of the best songs from the album
including ‘Everyday Robots’, ‘Mr
Tembo’ and ‘Heavy Seas of Love’.
He also played some rarely heard
and even previously never performed
Blur and Gorillaz songs such as
the B-sides ‘The Man Who Left
Himself’ (Blur) and ‘Spitting Out
The Demons’ (Gorillaz), which was
a surprise. Furthermore, there was a
nice representation of all of Albarn’s
career with his The Good, The Bad and
The Queen and Mali Music projects
represented in this set.
However while all of these things
were good, it was the guests which
made this concert very special and
why it was included in my top five.
Graham Coxon joined Albarn in
the first encore to play some Blur
songs, including ‘Tender’ which
got the whole of the Royal Albert
Hall singing. Then in the second
encore, Kano was the guest for ‘Clint
Eastwood’ and De La Soul were the
guests for ‘Feel Good Inc.’ which lead
to a massive burst of energy right
near the end of the concert. The final
guest however was definitely the
most surprising; Brian Eno. Joining
Albarn for ‘Heavy Seas of Love’, it was
an extremely special moment and
even Albarn seemed shocked that it
was happening.
4. Metronomy at Alexandra
Palace (5th
December)
Metronomy have fine-tuned their
show to be a masterclass in how to
perform live. Despite not being a
sell-out show – likely due to them
headlining Field Day and playing a
host of other festivals – Metronomy
performed at perhaps their best ever.
They played a longer set than
expected which featured 23 songs and
contained a good mix of their whole
history as a band – unless you love Pip
Paine (Pay The £5000 You Owe) which
only had one song featured. The band
had plenty of charisma (that thing
Louis Walsh tells everyone on the X
Factor they have; just to let you know
none of them really do).
They took hits from The English
Riviera such as ‘The Bay’ and ‘The
Look’ and took them to the next
level with slightly weird but amazing
dancing by the band and a light show
to rival much bigger artists’. They
even took on the huge Beatles song
‘Here Comes the Sun’ and didn’t just
give it justice but made it their own.
Also, whilst Love Letters was not
as strong an album as The English
Riviera, they made those songs full
of life which did not occur as well on
record. But the highlight for me was
‘You Could Easily Have Me’ from Pip
Paine, which turned Alexandra Palace
into a massive dance arena. This was
the year that Metronomy became
truly huge and they are worthy to
headline bigger places.
3. Foals at Alexandra Palace
(14th
February)
Foals, at this point, had headlined
their first major UK festival at
Latitude the previous summer and
were fully ready for challenge of
Alexandra Palace, which was jam-
packed ready to see this Oxford indie
rock band. They took their extremely
popular songs and perfected them
live; they were extended to just the
right point with the band in perfect
unison with each other.
Foals took songs from their whole
career from ‘Hummer’, one of their
first singles, to ‘Providence’ from
Holy Fire. Their set only contained
13 songs in total but when the songs
are played so well it made little
difference.
The crowd was simply mental;
mosh pits opened throughout and
took the width of Alexandra Palace,
they hit the floor like a tribal dance
and generally sung and danced like
there was no tomorrow. The band
had a very impressive light show
particularly during ‘Spanish Sahara’
with a show more akin to dance music
concerts than an indie rock concert.
However, the main highlight was
‘Two Steps Twice’ which is one of the
best songs to end a gig; it builds up
slowly for about eight minutes until
the drums really kick in and everyone
screams the lyrics and runs into each
other. I left with a bruise over my face
but it was incredible and that lone
song cemented them on this list.
2. Kasabian at Brixton
Academy (1st
December)
Kasabian had a huge year in 2014,
in which they had another number
one album with 48:13, played a
huge homecoming show in Victoria
Park in Leicester and headlined
the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury
Festival. Finishing the year they went
to a much smaller venue, Brixton
Academy, for a five day residency.
There was a huge hype right
before them due to a bright pink
timer which counted down until the
first song, ‘Bumblebeee’ which was
performed initially acoustically.
The crowd still went for it with all
of their might singing every word
as loud as the band could play; this
gig was definitely the loudest I had
experienced at Brixton Academy.
Random words such as ‘two-er’ and
‘flannel’ would appear on the back
screen which were likely an in-joke
by the band. As the gig went on, the
energy of the crowd did not wane and
mosh pits remained a permanent
feature of the concert.
Their songs featured some snippets
of other famous songs such as
‘Black Skinhead’ featuring as the
introduction for ‘Shoot the Runner’
which increased the energy of the
crowd even more. The best of these
snippets was ‘Word Up’ by Cameo
during ‘Re-Wired’. They did not
skimp on the new songs either, with
7 out of 21 songs being from 48:13,
which in my opinion is the best album
since their self-titled as a whole.
They did not have just the hits in
the show either, with rarely played
songs such as ‘Cutt Off’ which made
This gig was
definitely
the loudest
I had
experienced
at Brixton
Academy!
This was the
year that
Metronomy
became truly
huge and
are worthy
to headline
bigger places
