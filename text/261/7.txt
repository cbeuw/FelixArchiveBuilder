DAYS OF FUTURE
PASSED
Greece is a tend where the son shines so bright that the whole
land looks golden and the sea is as deep a blue as one could eve?
wish to see and it makes the English Channel on the brightest day
look like an autumn mist. It was a perfect setting for one of the
greatest intellectual Empires that s ever held the stage. To-day,
as Byron's poem tells, the grandeur of those days is no more.
The isles of Greece, the isles of Greece!
Where burning Sappho loved and sung,
Where grew the arts of war and peace,
Where Delos rose and Phoebus sprung!
Eternal summer gilds them yet,
But all, except their sun is set.
What remains is a land where
the people who made Greece the
shining pearl in the Mediteranean
Oyster, live on in the crumbling
ruins and in the attitudes of these
Common people. Through count-
less centuries, war has left its
mark not only on the visual splen-
dours of the classic era but also
on the traditions of the Greeks.
It is not surprising then, that after
centuries of Turkish occupation^
that the food they eat, the games
they play and the clothes they
wear resemble those of the Turks,
whom they hate so much. In-
deed their animosity towards the
Turks is so great that if one
should mention that one is con-
templating travelling ia, Turkey
they visibly quiver. To the
Greeks they are vagabonds or
gipsies and nothing is safe in their
midst.
The cheapest way to reach
Greece would be to travel by train
on a Brian Hughes Party to
Athens and take enough food to
last for the whole journey. It is a
long journey, exactly three days,
but although uncomfortable at
times with six to a carriage, this
is entirely compensated for by the
unstinting friendship of the many
people of different nationalities
that one meets. If one travels this
way on reaching Athens one usu-
ally finds oneself migrating to-
wards the Hotel Marion in Plateia
Vathis where for 15 drs one can
sleep on the roof and have a hot
shower. It is advisable to bring

your own sleeping bag or else you
are likely to have a very uncom-
fortable night. Every night there
are usually about 80 English
people there and it's rather like
being at a boarding house at
Oacton.
Beaches
If one's idea of a perfect hoih
day is to sit on the beach all day
and let your body imbibe the sun
and then live it up at night,
Greece will prove rather limited,
for the night atmosphere is less
that of the fast moving luxury of
St. Tropez but more of the gay
slow moving sensual atmosphere
of a tropical island. As regards
beaches Greece has plenty to
offer. The humid island of Corfu
with its acres of Cypress trees
has miles oLsoft sandy beaches
and shady inlets. The suburbs of
Athens too have fine beaches, but
these are usually expensive and
always crowded. The best beaches
I think to be found on the main-
land are near Kavalla in Northern
Greece, which is one of those rare
parts which unaccountably he off
the tourist map. Kavalla is a
town rebuilt from the ravages of
the Nazi occupation and its peo-
ple, like all Greeks are warm and
friendly. They can be seen in
their most charming attitude in
the evening as they stroll down
the quayside drinking and eating
as they go. For in Greece tele-
vision has not yet reared its ugly
head.
The loveliest place in my mind
in the whole of Greece is Crete.
It is much less arid, it attracts far
fewer tourists and therefore is less
commercialised and has a charac-
ter all its own. It is as different
from the rest of Greece as
Provence is from the rest of
France.

I shall never forget the great
kindness and hospitality that was
accorded me wherever I went.
One particular instance comes to
mind when one night in the little
village of Mallia a friend and my-
self had just finished a very en-
joyable meal and settled the bill
when the proprietor, who always
looked as if he was smiling, asked
us to come and sit with him. He
then presented us with an endless
supply of the local wine and little
garnishes like cucumbers, feta, the
typical Greek cheese and kebabs
and watermelon until at about
three a.m. more than a little ine-
briated we returned to the Youth
Hostel. This performance was
repeated every night that we were
there.
Far from the
madding
crowd
No journey to Crete would be
complete without making a pil-
grimage to Matala in the south of
the island. There can be found
not only the fascinating Roman
burial caves but also large num-
bers of seemingly innocent hashish
smokers. Not far from Matala is
a tiny village called Aghia Gallini
and if you want to spend a quiet
holiday in a secluded spot with
the minimum comforts of life
then this is the place for you. It
II
was said by the inhabitants that
once people came they never
wanted to leave, which seemed to
be quite accurate, for of the twelve
people there at the time, none
save myself had been there less
than three weeks and there were
two Americans who'd been there
nearly two years. But I thinK the
question really was not that they
did not want to leave, but that
they couldn't. For there is only
one bus each day and that leaves
at 4.30 in the morning and since
there is no electricity it is virtually
impossible to find out the time.
If you db manage tocatch the bus
to Heraklion then you are more
than likely to have your spine
fractured as the bus bumps along
On the twisting boulder-strewn
track. Should you eventually
reach Heraklion you must visit
the palace of Knossos where Sir
Arthur Evans spent £250,000 of
his own money in excavating and
rebuilding the Minoan palaces. If
Knossos fires your imagination
there are many other impressive
sites to be visited, including
Phaistsos, Aghia Triada, Gortys
and Mallia, and it would be worth
paying a visit to the museum at
Heraklion to see the recon-
structed frescoes and mosaics
from the various palaces.
Greece then is a place of great
contrast; from the dry arid land-
scapes of Mykonos and the
Cyclades to the lush green valleys
of Crete and Rhodes. If you
should once set foot in Crete you
wlR never want to leave for if you
were to ask me to choose a para-
dise on earth then it would be
Crete.

Many people would say that London is already sufficiently well-
endowed with art galleries, considering that there are the National,
Tate, Royal Academy, Courtauld Institute, the Whitechapel, the
smaller public galleries and all the commercial ones. The first re-
action when onefindsthat another one is to open is that its presence
is hardly necessary.
And then one finds that the new premises of the Institute of
Contemporary Arts are to be more than just a conventional art gal-
lery, although much of its activity -wL"v

, in a broad sense, that of
an art gallery; the provision of a place to show works of art. The
works of art in question, however, will not be confined to paintings
and sculpture, though these will not be neglected, but will include
films, television, theatre, dance, poetry and other ait forms which
lie between or beyond the conventional boundaries.
The ICA was founded in 1947 by Sir Herbert Read art"? Su
Roland Penrose among others. Its first exhibition was entitled
"40,000 Years of Modern Art" and was designed to show the essential
similarity of prehistoric, archaic.and tribal art and the.avant-garde.
Soon afterwards, it moved to permanent premises in Dover. Street,
where the first London exhibitions of Dubuffet, Cartier-Bresson aud
Matter were held.
New Home
In December 1967 the lease on
the Dover Street premises ran.
out. A part of Carlton House-
Terrace had, with the aid of the
Arts Council, been acquired and
While the exterior of the magnifi-
cent John Nash-designed terrace
was left unaltered the interior was
being gutted and converted into a
gallery, a cinema-cum-theatre,
workshop and offices. At the
same time, Michael Kustow, who
had previously worked on Centre
42 and had spent four years with
the Royal Shakespeare Company
where he organised the Royal
Shakespeare Club, was appointed
director. The new premises are
shared with four other societies of
art and design : Society of In-
dustrial Artists and -Designers,
Designers and Art Directors
Association, Design and Indus-
tries Association and Institute of
Landscape Artists.
Opening
Ceremonies
The official opening of Nash
House as the property is being
called, was by Jennie Lee,
Minister of the Arts, on April
10th, but prior to this two events
were held there. One was the
" housewartning" party with
2,000 guests, wine, food, fantastic
Mark Boyle lightshows, a band
of African drummers, two beat
groups and an experimental
dancer, and the other un address
by Buckminster Fuller, inventer
of the geodesic dome, designer of
the US pavilion at Expo '67 and
winner of the Gold Medal of the
RIBA.
The present exhibition, which is
the opening one at Nash 1- use,
is called " The Obsessive Image,"
the image being man himself. It
is, when one looks at future plans
for the 'centre, almost; a con-'
vcntional exhibition, of painting
and sculpture executed since
1960. The choice of theme seems
to have been inspired, by the need
to find a sufficiently broad topic
relevant to the aims of the ICA,
and by confining the exhibits,
except for three films and a work
consisting of a succession of
colour slides, to paintings and
sculptures which are the oldest
and best established art forms, it
demonstrates that it has not re-
jected any of the old in search of
the new.
Robbed of the novelty which
surrounds, and is one of the at-
tractions of, new art forms, the
exhibits must stand on their own
merits and stand comparison
with, for example, the best the
Tate has to offer in its modern
section. This they do very welL
As may be expected when the
subject is such a complex topic as
man, the exhibits show a wide
variety of interpretations. Some,
such as Niki de Saint-Phalle's
"Clarice Again," are unashamedly
fun, others are concerned with
love and hate, with suffering and
grief, some celebrate man's free-
dom and others his increasing
mechanisation and conformity.
To single out any particular
exhibits would be to prejudice
their evaluation by anyone else.
However, if you can take time off
from revising and can afford the
price of 2/6 for members and
5/- for non-members, " The Ob-
sessive Image " is worth a visit as
a fairly comprehensive up-to-the
minute review of " conventional"
painting and sculptures. The ex-
hibition is open until- 29th May
and is open Tuesdays to Satur-
days from 11 a.m.—6 p.m., Sun-
days 2-6 p.m., closed on Mondays.
