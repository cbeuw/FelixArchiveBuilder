For the graduate or prospective graduate thinking of taking up
teaching as a career, a vast range of opportunities and salaries present
themselves. But it is not only this that can make teaching attractive,
it is as much helping children of ail social backgrounds in the com-
plex process of growing up and making the best of their varying arid
developing attitudes. Some graduates may prefer to teach sixth
formers, others a range of subjects to the less able secondary pupils
and yet others to »?ach in primary schools. At all these levels, teaching
jTers more scope than many other careers for graduates to employ
their knowledge of their chosen subjects, sal ihess Is sacs
meat to go on studying them,
Pay Scales
Base salary scales for un-
trained graduates start at £900
p.a. and for graduates, with six
years training, study or research
behind them, at £1060, rising to a
maximum of £1600 and £1650 re-
spectively. Good honours gradu-
ates, however, may expect to get
£120 p.a. more, all the way up the
scale, plus a £70 allowance if they
teach in the London area. This
is not all, for the structure of
graded posts and headships of
departments and schools is an im-
portant element in the graduate
teachers' career prospects. 80
per cent of men in their late thir-
ties or older, with reasonable
qualifications, have risen at least
to the position of head of depart-
ment and a fifth are headmasters.
Graded j»sts carry allowances
from £125 to £315, heads of de-
partments from £210 to £700 and
deputy heads from £125 to £1055,
depending on the size of the
school. Headmasters' salaries
range, once again, according to
the size and age-range of the
school, from £1710 in the smallest
primary schools to £4110 in the
largest comprehensive schools.
No additions are applicable to
heads' salaries, except, where ap-
propriate, the £70 London allow-
ance. Looking ahead, retirement
benefits are also paid in the form
of an annual allowance and a
lump sum, calculated on the
average salary for the last three
years of service.
Special Schools
There are less well known op-
portunities in special schools for
handicapped children (both
physically and mentally handicap-
ped), and in approved schools.
Training is available for teaching
in these special schools, which
provide a satisfying career for the
right person, with an extra allow-
ance of £130 a year. Approved
schools are residential establish-
ments providing academic and
vocational education for children
and young people who have been
sent because they have committed
an offence or are beyond control
at home or because they need
care or protection. The aim is to
prepare them to take their place
again in society and to cope with
its responsibilities and strains.
H.M. Inspectors
Careers are also available, after
necessary experience in some
aspect of education, in H . M .
Inspectorate of Schools. Inspec-

APPLICATIONS are invited from
graduates who wish to qualify as
teachers and specialise in Physical
Education as well as their degree
subject. The course is grant-aided,
recognised by the Department of
Education and Science, and leads
to a graduate certificate in educa-
tion and a diploma in physical
education.
For prospectus and application
form apply to The Principal, City
of Leeds and Carnegie College,
Beckett Park, Leeds 6
tors are usually recruited through
public advertisement and salaries
start at £2390 p.a. rising to £5950
for the highest posts. The work
includes inspection of schools,
preparation of pamphlets and lia-
sion work between the Depart-
ment of Education and Science
and Local Education Authorities.
Equality of Sexes
The L.E.A.'s also offer occu-
pations in administration with
salary scales rising from a low of
£1850 a year for the lowest paid
borough education officers to
over £5300 for chief education
officers. Other openings exist in
the forces, industry, youth work
and adult educational, research,
education journalism and careers
overseas.
One of the advantages for wo-
men is that it offers them equal
opportunities with men. Even
marriage need not be a deterrent,
for schools are glad of their ser-
vices as long as they are available
and will welcome them back if
they decide to resume their pro-
fessional careers.
Teaching on
how to Teach
One year P.G. courses of train-
ing are provided in universities
and colleges of education which
benefit the teacher by enabling
him to practice and experiment
under experienced eyes and also
to pick up an extra £50 a year
when he starts work. A Graduate
Teacher Training Registry exists
at 151, Gower St., W.C.I, to pro-
cess swiftly applications for ad-
missions to these courses.
Further details can be found in
a booklet " Careers in Education
for Graduates" available from
the Department of Education and
Science in Curzon Street, W.l.
B a n k i n g
Today, the term 'banking' means
much more than the process of re-
ceiying and lending money. Banks
have many ancillary services, and are
adding more to their operations each
year. They can do almost anything
for a customer from keeping his
valuables, to helping him make his
will, and, supervising his estate When
he has died. They assist in foreign
currency transaction, advise in tax
matters, and help in the purchase
and sale of stocks and shares.
Wide Horizons
Anyone joining one of the main
'Clearing banks' as they are called,
has roughly a fifty per cent chance
of becoming a manger (and there
are women managers). As with all
the professions, there are exams set
iby the Institute of Bankers—these
cover subjects as far apart as geo-
graphy and economics' to monetary
theory and accountancy. It's not too
difficult to put all ,,the necessary
exams behind you in five years.
Obviously a manager must know
the whole sphere of banking, and
most of the theory he will need to
know is contained in the diploma
course,
Managers have to deal with a
cross section of people, face to face,
giving them advice or warnings.
They have to maintain close contact
with the commercial and industrial
communities, both locally and nat-
ionally. They1
need a far shrewder
judgment and a far wider knowledge
than most professional men.
But hard work is involved. Theory
and practice are mentally and physi-
cally very tiring, and the first few
years served as a bank clerk or
cashier are not always enjoyable.
But it's a career with wide horizons
and high standards.

Where can I find the right environment to launch my career ? A young man, graduating in physics or
electronic engineering can find the answer in E.M.I. Electronics Limited.
E.M.I, have long been a dynamic force in the design, development, manufacture and marketing of
microwave and photoelectronic devices including photomultiplier tubes, camera tubes, and microwave
tubes as well as solid state devices such as microwave sources and radiation detectors.
Close integration of all these activities provides exceptional opportunities for career development.
If you are taking a physics degree and have a bias'towards physical-chemistry or vacuum technology or in
electrical engineering with a leaning towards development work we would like to talk
to you and show you some of the work we are doing in these areas.
