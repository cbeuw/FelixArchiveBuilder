Plea
Once upon a time, and not so
very long ago at that, I met a
girl who was cast in the mould of
Aphrodite, had eyes as cool and
beautiful as a mountain stream
on a warm spring day, a face as
warm and smiling as a harvest
moon in the autumn midnight, a
mind as still.and as deep as the
midsummer twilight—and she
thought I was sloshed.
To remedy this small defect in
our relationship, I decided to
write her a letter. This, dear
reader, is where the problem
starts! Would you tell her she
was a Grecian goddess, as mellow
yellow as the yellow mellow
marshmallow moon and still
expect her to take you seriously?
Could you, leaning heavily on
your brash boyish charm, think
she would take you as you want
to be taken? And you, madam,
ignoring innuendos, would you
mistake love for lust? The prob-
lem becomes apparent, HAS
ROMANCE H A D ITS D A Y ?
Bowing to the pressures of the
Sensual Sixties, the notion of
romance is being slowly torn to
shreds and tossed piece by glori-
ous piece into the litter basket of
life. How otherwise can it be
when the population accepts " Up
the Junction" as the norm of
human behaviour. This film,
above all, shows how the roman-
tic notions of the Chelsea heiress
are swamped by the gross materi-
alism of her lover and her friends.
Nowadays, a great proportion of
people (both male and female)
sacrifice their virginity on the pre-
marital bed, and I would venture
to say, not primarily because of
from
the heart
love but because it is fast becom-
ing the accepted thing to satisfy
the basic sexual instincts as early
in life as possible and then as
often as posible until the day of
impotency arrives. A l l this is
pushing romantic love to the back
of the stage. You, dear reader,
probably scorn these thoughts,
but is it really worth throwing up
all the happiness of traditional
romance just because you think
your friends will laugh themselves
silly at you?
As students, we are generally
viewed to be in the forefront of
the sexual revolution, but how
many of us have, as a by product
of this revolution, thrown ro-
mance out of the door. Don't get
me wrong friend, I'm not trying
to preach Victorian morals! By
all means sleep with your bird or
bloke of the moment, but let
words from the heart be the
beckoning red light to promis-
cuity between the pure white hall
sheets. Don't shun romance-
culture it, and then make love
all you want. Just don't let sex
<tease to be partner to romance.
That's my message. Campaign
to bring back, romance into our
everyday lives and loves. Don't
let's get stifled in sterile compu-
teriesed love. Don't think like a
girl who told me the other day
that holding hands was "pukey."
Don't just make love—make ro-
mantic love and be all the happier
for it.
Meanwhile, this girl is still cast
in the mould of Aphrodite, with
eyes as cool and as beautiful as

Elektra's Beautiful S o n s
The Hangman's Beau: iful
Daughter (Eleetra E U K 258:
39s. lid.) is the third L P to come
from England's very own Incred-
ible String Band. The Observer
sang its praises; Melody Maker
raved over i t ; the Sunday Times
called its songs " incredible:
loosd knit poetry, antiurban,
pantbe'sric, imaginative, com-
plex, using strange harmonies . . .
convincing, beautiful, idiosyn-
cratic, yielding more with each
nlavins. . . ." All of which h
accurate. Now FELIX joins in
the glad tidings although it can
4b little more than endorse the
opinions of the' aforementioned
organs in stating that the LP is
very good and a worthy purchase
whether your taste be for " folk "
or " progressive " music.
The tracks, ten in all, are
penned by either one or other of
the Band; the majority coming
from the more obviously creative
of the two, Robin Williamson,
his songs tend to be meandering
and personal with lines of great
beauty; the songs of Mike Heron,
on the other hand, are moredirect
and forceful, simpler to compre-
hend and touched with a dry
humour. The longest, a ten
minute opus by Heron, called " A
Very Cellular Song" embodies
the preoccupation of the L P with
the mysteries of life, (Mother)

nature, Christianity; it also shows
the initially disconcerting habit of
the Incredibles to change tempo
and accompaniament almost in
mid-sentence. The accompania-
ment itself is something of a sur-
prise involving (to name a few
instruments) guitar, sitar, whistle,
hammer dulcimer, pan pipe, oud,
chahanai and water harp (this is
a pail of water with a string across
it). The singing too is curious;
Robin Williamson lingers over his
songs, squeezing four or five notes
into a single syllable with ease.
The whole effect is unique and
the L P is capable of repaying a
lot of listening; it's also beauti-
fully packaged.
Two other recent issues from
Elektra are " Good Time Music "
and " Select Elektra," both an-
thologies Off their catalogue. The
first is a mixture of white blues
and jug band music, and features
the Loving Spoonful, Paul Butter-
field, Eric Clapton, with the
Powerhouse (whoever they are),
also A l Kooper, and Tim Rose.
If you like the white blues, John
Mayall-style scene (I don't), this
L P is good value for money with
14 tracks. "One More M i l e "
by Butterfield is good, and their
version of " Spoonful" is one of
the better ones; Clapton performs
well on "Stepping Out;" the
Spoonful tracks are rather
ordinary and include "Almost
Grown" and the all-time favourite
" Searchin' " A good piece of
background music, the L P is
"Good Time Music" (EUK
260).
The other album, replete with
sycophantic sleeve notes by John
Peel, is more wide ranging, being
11 " progressive pop" tracks.
Standouts are "Suzanne" (Judv
Collins), lyrically beautiful, well
sung: " Morning Glory" (Tim
Buckley) a good example of his
work; " She Comes in Colours "
(Love), off the da Cppo LP; and
a short version of " Light My
Fire" by the demonic Doors,
omitting the Classic four minute
instrumental break of the LP..
The Incredible String Band are
represented by "First Girl I
Loved," a poor track, and crap
tracks are * Aries " by Cosmic
Sounds (what can you expect with
a name like that) and " Home of
the Brave " (very sickj by Earth
Opera. In general, though, it is
another good anthology, worth
hearing if you can ignore the bad
ifumbers. Select Elektra (EUK
261).

fitting
on a
column
If you cruise up the river like
I did the other weekend, some-
where below the Albert Bridge
you'll see the Palace of West-
minster. As you go higher up,
put away your posters of " I howl
for Powell " and " Black Enoch "
and try to dismiss his ideas on the
rftCe problem as those of a Grand
Nationalist. Look on the other
side and you'll see a sign which
says: "Thousands ot pounds
wasted every year. Save ,your
waste-paper." It was of course
explained by the barges full of
waste-paper lying beside the
wharf. Nevertheless, it would
have been more appropriate to
have finished with " Don't waste
paper." But the bits of paper
will always pour out: bits of un-
necessary confetti for somebody's
archives.
My desk lies perpetually lit-
tered with bits of calculations;
engineering reference books; re-
cord sleeves; a pile of letters that
I must get round to replying to
some time; various political tracts
such as the Economist whose
facts I usually accept and whose
conclusions I never do and the
Tribune whose facts I treat with
scepticism and whose conclusions
I usually accept; and occasional
scraps of poetry, called verse by
everyone else. To do anything,
one has to consume vast quanti-
ties of paper. I wanted to find
out what the Robbins Report—
that Government paper on Higher
Education—had to say about IC.
"I'm afjraid it's rather large,"
said the librarian, producing
twelve volumes of facts and sta-
tistics and evidence.
To get people to listen to you,
you must be verbose. And some-
times obvious. Like that Yardley
advert which says '"Girls are
coming back." So before every
Council meeting one is regaled
with mountains of words. I'm
doing my bit, I admit. I hope I
shall be brief and to the point.
But I doubt that people absorb
ideas—as opposed to facts—with-
out having them hammerad home
paragraph by paragraph.
I even got two complimentary
copies of PHOENIX last week.
Why two? Last time I got one.
Are they trying to get rid of it?
Or am I supposed to read it
twice? Perhaps the literary
qualities of members of IC need
to be hammered "nome, copy by
copy. Or advert by advert. As
you walk through the Union
foyer, it would seem from them
that, after lectures, the average
student has an hour of political
discussion, an arty film, a night of
orgy, followed by repentance at
early morning Hall Communion.
And now it's the mad season
when manifestoes and profiles
pour out. " Frederick Blockle-
knocker appeared in a waste-
paper basket at the age of three
years. After twelve years at
Much Wallowing in the Marsh
Primary School, he scrambled
out to Nether Wallop Grammar
School where his nether was wal-
loped 25 times in his first three
veeks there. His humour and
masochism should make him a
good Guilds Vice-President."
The humour of these things is
consistent—it's bad. My favour-
ite profile is of the guy who
master-minded the campaign of
Birmingham's new president Ray
Phillips : " Three years' hard and
BINGO—he's in! And you have
the utterly depressing sight of Ray
Phillips keeping his sweating bum
warm in the hot seat."
Maybe you consign these mani-
festoes straight to the bin. I was
gently surprised to finff the ether
day that all my six election points
of last year have been acted on,
This year I would say "Don't
waste paper." But most people
believe what they write. They
just write too much.
Who said "LookwJWs talk-
ing"?
The Charge Of The
Light Brigade
There can't be many among us
who haven't heard of The Charge
of the Light Brigade—the one at
the Odeon, Leicester Square, of
course.
Leaving the cinema after the
performance there were no vivid
memories of flashing swords and
shining buttons but rather of what
one can only take as nure realism.
The men's boots had just the
right amount of dust on them and
their rackets were as tattv as they
must have been at the time. The
incompetence of the officers must
be somewhat downheartenitag to
all romantics but on reflection
strikes a very true note. Even
the Light Brigade itself didn't
strike me as particularly coura-
geous. The film showed admir-
ably the pointlessness of the fight-
ing in the Crimean war, and the
stupidity of the tactics employed.
As a story the film is worth
little. It is a series of events
vaguely connected by the lives of
various characters. The reaction
to the war back at home was vir-
tually unexplored, a rather im-
portant omission, I think, as the
whole film, to my mind, was
meant to be only an accurate
historical account of the events
surrounding the Charge, and if
anything made it memorable, it
was the contemporary British
newspapers.
However the film was most
enjoyable and if not quite as
memorable as the actual event,
one can hardly blame today's
newspapers. Despite' all this it
is, as they say, "well worth
seeing."

Elections in Britain
" Elections in Britain " by R.
L. Leonard is a comprehensive
review of the principles and me-
thods of elections in Britain.
Originally entitled " Guide to the
General Election " and published
first before the 1964 General Elec-
tion as an attempt to acquaint
people with electoral methods in
this country, it has been com-
pletely rewritten and expanded
and gives both details of the
mechanics of elections and com-
ment upon them backed up by
statistics of recent elections.
In particular T
found the chap-
ters on the organisation ot the
political parties and on opinion
polls very interesting, with per-
haps the passage on selection of
candidates (drawn from experi-
ence of trying to become adopted)
the most lively.
All in all the book is a positive
mine of information for anyone
who is likely to be involved in an
election, whether as candidate,
canvasser or voter. It is published
by D. Van Norstrand Co. Ltd.
and costs 12/6d. paperback and
35s. hardback.
