Once again the I.C Publicity
Officer got it wrong. Last term
it was " the crazy world of IXL's
Quorate Union Meeting" — an
unlikely prospect if ever there
was one. Last week it was " the
Union Meeting to decide I.C.'s
future. Be there." 200 people
were there, a quorum is 300. Only
one decision was taken—by Pres-
dent Phillips—of no eart'i-sha
tering significance. It was to re-
convene the meeting for next
Friday—when, it was piously
hoped, the publicity from tl.i;
FELIX would be enough to push
the attendance over the 300
mark. So I repeat—there will be
a Union Meeting this Friday at
1 o'clock, thij Friday, May 10th,
a Union Meeting, this Friday,
1 o'clock.. . .
Trivia
The last one lasted half-an-
hour. It was a restless affair with
the audience poised to dash out
the instant Phillips gave the word.
Rory Redmayne's revolutionary
motion was not discussed. Mat-
ters that were, included the Dow
Chemicals affair, following Phil
Painter's letter in the last FELIX
claiming censorship of the affair.
Phillips cleared up the mat-
ter to the temporary satisfac-
tion of Painter. Frank Fuchs
suggested a bus to take de»
monstrators to last Wednesday's
R.S.A. Grants Meeting at Lin-
coln's Inn Fields. Sensibly the
proposal was rejected. (In
the upshot, two people went.
Frank Fuchs did not; nor did
Babs Hedge, I.C.'s External
Officer, it being a Radical demon-
stration.) Fiery Spooks Duckett
cracked a topical joke about
paying to send Mackman, RCS
President, home. There was no-
thing else to the meeting, except
that the Quorum was challenged
by the President. Top brains in
the Union question the constitu-
tional validity of this procedure.
How important a point that is
must remain a matter of indi-
vidual taste.
Friday
ENTS weathered some very awkward moments at Friday Night's
May Bail when Kytes had to cancel their engagement at the last
tninute and Brian Auger was over an hour late in arriving. How*
ever, apart from one or two uncomfortably long pauses, the con-
tinuity of the entertainment was good, although the timing of events
was so badly affected that the Scaffold only put in one appearance.
The standard of the entertain-
ment was very good (an unbeliev-
able improvement on last vear)
The Scaffold did a 45 minute
cabaret which included sonsis
(protest and otherwise); "poems"
such as:
Got up
Shaved
Did the "Times " crossword
Shaved,
a risque adaptation of the Bible
story complete- with " three Wise
guys bringing a golden franken-
stein to the mayor;" and an
exclusive interview with Ho Chi
Minh. Brian Auger was well
worth waiting for, and his organ
playing together with Julie Dris-
coll's spectacular singing drew a
large audience to the Concert
Hall. In the lower lounge " The
Shevells," Fairport Convention'.'
and " The Glass Cartoon " were
a great success, so much so that a
large number of people were
dancing to "The Glass Cartoon's"
rock as late as 3 a.m., after which
the evening ended to the mellower
tones of the " Splinter Group."
Mr. Mooney seems to have ac-
quitted himself adequately. At
any rate, the complaints heard
were about the service and the
lack of coffee after the 2nd and
3rd sittings, so the meal can't
have been bad.
ENTS can afford to be well
pleased with themselves. Con-
sidering /the difficulties Jencoun-
tered, the May Bali's Success was
quite remarkable.

Rory Redmayne's motion to be
(hopefully) discussed next Friday
aims to do away with Union
Meetings on the grounds that no-
body ever goes to them. They
would be replaced by meetings of
departmental representatives and
council. If such is your wish,
come along and say so, next
Friday. Here is a final plug.
Next Friday—a Union Meeting!
1 p.m.—the Union concert Hall
next Friday. (This advertising
space was kindly donated to the
Union by FELIX).

Lord Beeching's speech at the
RCS Dinner last Thursday has
provoked a wave of criticism
over his implication that students
at IC are not involved in protest
movements.
His address, notable for its
brevity, reached an all-time low
for after dinner speeches in the
College.
Beginning with remarks about
what was expected of an after
dinner speaker, to talk on either
his own activities of his hosts
depending on which was the more
notable, he then made a few re-
remarks on the problems of re-
tiring from a highly successful
career.
From this he went on to speak
of student (protests and expressed
pleasure that IC had not become
involved. He wound up by com-
menting that people seemed more
shocked by the childish behaviour
of children than the childish be-
haviour of the adults they were
copying. His remark was highly
ambiguous and no-one is sure
how to interpret it.
In another poorly delivered
speech R.C.S. President Bob
Mackman thanked Lord Beech-
ing and called upon RCSA to
help bridge the gap between a
university education and industry.
The first good speech of the
evening came from Mike Tait,
who introduced the guests in an
amicably insulting manner.
Lord Beeching, Bob Mackman and the Rector at the R.CS. Dinner
The last and best speech was
given by Mr. Buchanan, President
of RCSA, who was cheered when
he told the audience that he only
got a lower second degree, made
suitable denigrations of Mines and
Guilds and told a number of good
• stories.
Emergency
After approaches had been
made to him by a number of
members of RCS General Com-
mittee, Bob Mackrr called an
emergency committee meeting at
which Spooks Duckett demanded
that strong letters be sent to Lord
Beeching and The Times. He was
supported by Dave Wield, and
Pete Dolwin. Most other members
of the committee did not think
that a letter to the Times was ad-
visable and in the end a fairly
mild letter was sent to Lord
Beeching informing him that
" there are in fact, -numbers of
students at Imperial College who
are actively concerned in protest
movements . . . without detriment
to their academic work."
After the meeting Duckett ex-
pressed his intention of writing to
The Times personally.
