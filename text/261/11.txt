Insurance by
nus
The National Union of Students has its own Insurance Department,
Endsleigh Insurances (Brokers) Ltd. which is a totally owned
subsidiary. A Broker buys on behalf of his client in the open market
and it is the function of Endsleigh to place at the student's disposal
the knowledge, advice and expertise of its fully-trained staff on every
insurance matter. Whilst a student and when a graduate you can
call on this free advice in placing your insurance because our
service is nation-wide. The Department is able to place business
with virtually every Insurance Company and in addition runs
special schemes with reduced rates.

discounts available to N.U.S. members
WHAT DISCOUNTS?
Our table below shows what Companies are quoting and their
estimates for the future. The Economist publishes tables every
five years comparing Companies by past performances.
Each system of evaluation has advantages and disadvantages, but
PLANNED SAVINGS, an independent life assurance review,
attempts to combine both methods, and of the top five Companies
listed NUS Insurance has special schemes with two. This Review,
furthermore, compares at normal rates, but our schemes involve
substantial discounts for members, amounting to as much as 16%
in some cases.
