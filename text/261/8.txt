RUGBY CLUB HITS BELGIUM
Judging by the difficulty some
of the party had in awakening at
9.30 a.m. on Saturday 23 March,
the ICWA Formal the night be-
fore must have been quite a suc-
cess.
At this early stage the (already)
careworn Captain was worried
about his team. The original
party of 20 had been gradually
whittled down to 17 players by
injuries and calls made by
examiners. As four matches were
to be played on rather hard
ground this seemed a somewhat
scanty body of men—in numbers,
that is.
However, the 17 were smoothly
away from Victoria at 11 a.m.
and after a bracing boat trip from
Dover to Ostend during which
Dick WiHcox distinguished (or
was it extinguished?) himself with
a bottle of Drambuie, and an
hour-long train journey, we ar-
rived in Brussels at six p.m.
We wandered down the Rue
du Marche to an abode for the
week—the "Hotel des Touristes"
—where "all the Rugby teams
stay." We were to wander down
this street many more times
during the weeks as it was the
very heart of Brussels* red lamp
district.
On Sunday we were taken to a
ground at Kelle where, against a
side we took to be the National
Team, we won 59-0. Of course
it wasn't the National team!
After two days of sightseeing
and other entertainments we met
the National Team at 9 p.m.,
under floodlights. This was the
first game played by IC under
floodlights and it seemed to suit
us well. We won 16-3 against
really quite good opposition. John
Kelly was in brilliant form scoring
two great tries, much to the de-
light of the home crowd and the
ire of the National team.
The I.C. party with Meads
We enjoyed Tuesday night,
some more than others. Messrs
Kelly, Ballard, Harding and
Smithies arrived for breakfast
from the outside of the building
in a condition unusual for the
hour.
The high cost of food in Brus-
sels made the financial situation
rather irksome but in between
" evannigs" we beat Brussels
University 34-0. This game was
played on the Thursday at mid-
day and it was the hottest March
day in Brussels for 135 years. To
test our stamina even further our
hosts had arranged a visit to the
"Wieleman's" Brewery for us
straight after the match. After
an exhausting tour of inspection
we were delighted to find that we
could drink as much of the Drew
as we liked—what a challenge!
Friday morning was spent being
entertained by our hosts, the
Belgian R F U on the 28th, 29th
and 30th floors of the Martini
Building. Plied with Martinis
and magnificent views, for an
hour we lived a James Bond
existence where before us had
been Brigitte Bardot, the Spurs
and IC Rugby Club (in 1962).
Our last game was on Saturday
against Avia. Despite valiant
efforts of the Scottish referee we
won yet again, on another very
hard pitch, this time by 27-3.
We returned to England, tired
and broke, on Sunday, celebrating
Dick Willcox's 21st on the boat-
poor devil!
Our trophies are to be seen in
. Southside bar (a pennant) and the
Union bar ( a bowl). Those who
went on the team were :
R. J. Pine, J. Lum, M . Dodson,
J. Ballard, J. Kelly, P. Cox, A .
Duke, R. Willcox, D. Bell, C.
Harding, B. Kettle, T. Stephen-
son, C. Cattell, M . Riley, J. Wild,
J. Jackson and J. Smithies.

WONDERBAR KOBENHAVN
Not to be outdone by the pro-
fessionals, IC footballers left
Liverpool Street station on 24th
March for a taste of European
football, plus a taste of other,
usually less vigorous continental
pastimes. Twenty-six hours of
travelling to Copenhagen were
ahead of them, containing a fair
share of incidents, both desirable
and undesirable but usually con-
cerning " desire " of some sort.
Most of the evening on the boat
was spent sampling Danish be-
verages; later the team demon-
strated some British traditions
and then one R. J. Horlock de-
monstrated some Ancient British
traditions as he went for an even-
ing stroll on deck wearing only a
bandage on his left ankle.
On arriving in Copenhagen, a
pleasant surprise was waiting—
no accommodation had been ar-
ranged. A temporary stay in one
of the cheapexjhotels in the centre
was sought and found but it
turned out that most of the guests
in this hotel were young, heavily-
made-up ladies who appeared to
spend much of their evenings
standing on the pavements of the
cold street outside. However,
blind eyes were turned to this
practice except those of R. J.
Horlock who was greatly in-
terested in all that went on.
The first game was against a
team from the Copenhagen AB
Club (who are Danish champions)
but all the players were students
at Copenhagen University. In a
close, hard-fought match IC got
two early goals and led by this
margin until the last ten minutes
when A B scored two quick goals
to tie the match. A good per-
formance, as the match was under
floodlights and on an all-weather
pitch, both completely new to the
IC team. The ground was rather
loose but on limb-contact very
hard unfortunately—the players
came off minus a few square
inches of their knee-cap skins,
all having had quite a few falls
except for R. J. Horlock who,
perhaps due to the films he saw in
the afternoon, managed to keep
erect throughout the game.
The second match: was Against
another Copenhagen league side
called Bronshoj, this time in the
afternoon and on grass. IC. won
5-3, due more to youthful fitness
than to skill, perhaps, as the
Bronshoj team contained some
very good players including two
ex-Danish internationals, but they
were getting on in years. One of
these internationals was against
IC's inside-right, R. J. Horlock,
who had a hard game.
The third and final match was
again under floodlights and on an
all-weather pitch, against the
Shoskavad reserve side who are
in the Danish National League,
second division. This was easily
lCs best performance; thev
played a very fast and clever
game and ended up convincing
5-0 winners. R. J. Horlock had
a very good game but complained
at being stiff at the finish.
On the whole, a very successful
tour, marred mainly by Danish
taxation producing a pint of beer
costing ten shillings on average,
but educational trips round the
Carlsberg and Tuborg Breweries
helped to reduce this anomaly.
ICWSC
On Friday 26th and Saturday
27th of April, the UX.U Ath-
letics championships took place
at Motspur Park.
ICWSC fielded a large team
which by sheer strength of num-
bers, won the Imperial Challenge
Cup for the winning ladies team.
Success was mainly due to Ann
Burrell, our captain, who won the*
Long Jump, High Jump, and 80
metres Hurdles titles to score 18
of our 49 points, although all
members of the team were suc-
cessful in gaining points in their
events.
The team was : —
Ann Burrell (Capt.), Dorothy
Atkinson, Thelma Brown, Joyce
Butcher, Lilas Campion, Susan
Long, Margaret Lumley, Janet
Manneld, Jane Pugh.
