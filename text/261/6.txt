Hie mate attractions of Tutkey are the clismte and fee price,
and of cource fee exotic East. To give some examples, a three ctmree
meal for two, with a bottle of wine and twenty cigarettes, costs about
10/-, the biggest peach yon can hay costs 2d., and a hotel can cost
6/- a night. The usual temperature was 80 and our on? day of rail
in a month was just average.
Most people head first for
Istanbul the city half in Europe
and half in Asia. The main
tourist sites are St. Sophia, some-
times said to be one of the won-
ders of the modern world, the
Blue Mosque which stands out
with its six tall minarets, and
Top' •>'. Topkapi was the old
Sulfar;'s palace, and it is now a
museum. The, inner palace con-
tains the treasury where almost
everything is made of solid gold,
including the washbasins—a
change from the usual sanitary
arrangements. The other big at-
traction is the Grand Bazaar
where you can buy a lot of junk,
or some real bargains. Care is
needed when buying jewellery es-
pecially. A hallmark is usually
a good guarantee, but once after
we refused to buy something
without a hallmark, the shop-
keeper offered to find a stamp
and mark it for us.
One of the most enjoyable
things is bargaining for what you
buy. You may be asked just a
little more than the true value, or
up to five times as much. By
bargaining in several shops the
correct values can be discovered
and the longer you spend the
lower the price usually is. Bar-
gaining can be a real battle of tile
wits, but always remember to
offer less than you think a thing
is worth.

A journey outside Istanbul into
Asian Turkey can be very re-
warding. Long distance coaches
are fairly cheap at around 10s. for
100 miles, and they always hand
round bottles of water from aa
ice-box at regular intervals, al-
most a necessity at that heat. A
trip along the coast can take you
through Bursa, Cannakale, Troy,
Pergamon, Izmir, Ephesus, and
down to the Aegaen Sea and can
be done in a few days at a fairly
leisurely pace.
We found that the Tarts were
always a very friendly and gener-
ous people, and it was very easy
to sit down in a cafe and chat. A
surprisingly large number of than
spoke some English, and they all
use it at the slightest opportunity.
Also you seem to meet quite a lot
of English people throughout the
country, especially large numbers
of students from IC.

EASY GET THERE
I do not believe that of the readers of this newspaper there can
be a single person who km not heard of the Soviet Union. I am m e
that some of you must- have been there, that others have already
decided to visit daring the coming summer, and that many others
dram about seeing fee country that was formed as a remit of fee
success of tie Great October Socialist Revolution in 1917 but feel
feat doing so would he rather difficult However thousands of British
tourists have already visited fee U.&SJL and can testify how easily
their dreams eome true.
As the Soviet Union is such a large country practically every
climatic condition, except tropical exists. There is one feature however
which is common to the whole country and this is the marked dif-
ference between the cold and hot seasons. Summer temperatures in
parts of the U.S.S.R. read 30°C (86°F) and higher while in winter the
mercury can fall to minus 30C° (and lower). The summer temperature
in Moscow and Leningrad is usually between 25 and 30°C, in Siberia
it can be hotter than Italy, while the Black Sea has a Mediteranean
climate.

You may travel in the Soviet
Union either individually or in
small groups. You can choose
your own route or take advantage
of the very wide choice of travel
arrangements offered by "In-
tourist," the U.S.S.R. company
for foreign tourists. Tours orga-
nized by " Intourist" last be-
tween eight and nineteen days
during which you will be able
to see different regions and
tours. For example if you
were to join the Central Asian
Tour (14 days) you would be able
to visit five cities and towns,
Moscow, Leningrad, Tashkent,
Bukhara, Samarkand. Another
tour (this one for 9 days) includes
Moscow, Kiev and Leningrad.
The Siberian Tour (13 days)
would take you to Moscow,
Irkutsk Bratsk, Novosibirsk, &c.
Some tours have a fixed starting
o r ors
Your Own
One of the best ways to travel is
by car. You can take your own
car to the U.S.S.R. or hire one
on the spot (self drive or with a
driver). There is the Volga 5
seat saloon or the Moskvitch 4
seat saloon. You can get to the
Soviet Union by car via Finland,
Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hun-
gary, or Rumania, or you could
take your car by ship to Lenin-
grad or a port on the Black Sea.
There is a large network of camp
sites available for private motor-
ists. At each camp site you will
be given a parking space and a
place to pitch yoUr tent. You
can also hire camping and sports
equipment. There are cafes and
small restaurants and for those
who prefer it, kitchens with gas
of electric stoves for doing your
own cooking. Provisions can be
bought on the snot. A gallon of
petrol in the U.S.S.R. costs from
2/7 to 4/3 depending on octane
rating. Diesel fuel is 1 /- a gallon.
Getting
There
Now, how else can one get to
the Soviet Union aoart from in
one's own car? There is a large
choice. If time is important you
can fly from London to Moscow
in less than four hours by Aero-
flot or BE A jet. There is also an
air route direct to Leningrad,
A comfortable Soviet sleeper-
coach is a solution that will bring
you to Moscow in two days, dur-
ing which time you will cross
Central and Eastern Europe, and
it will only cost you half the air
fare (return second class £62).
Those who like cruising can
enjoy a fascinating voyage from
London to Leningrad which lasts
about 5 days. The voyage itself
is a pleasant holiday and on the
way you will be able to see several
other parts. The cheapest single
ticket costs £23 inclusive of full
board. From April of this year
it has been possible to go from
London to Moscow by coach.
The journey lasts three days and
this is the cheapest way to get to
Moscow.
Finally I would like to give you
the address of " Intourist" in
London.

neering y« unxioog for fee rapid development of feefe
country even if at fleas they might seem.Mghtenfiigly .nationalistic.
If yon are «?«dfey yew can of

cheaper way to go h to travel
overland to >.-. 1 IPS sites or
Venice from where you can get a
boat to Haifa, CM tfcs.se last al-
ternatives the favourite on a
limited budget is to hitch to
Venice and travel across the
Mediterranean on fee passenger
ferry, which in itself is'quite an
experience. A point which might
be important if you subs • "intly
wish to visit an Arab co. ry is
(bat you must either not get your
passport stamped when entering
Israel or get a second passport for
asc in Arab countries.
Having got there, Israel has a
good network of youth hostels,
which vary j,. .standard from the
ultra-modern >ne at Beersheba to
the insect-n *d snacks of the
hostel on. tt Dead Sea, and if
you've ever * > • .( to sleep on camp
beds in a humid atmosphere at
1,000 ft below sea level to the
accompaniment of a couple of
fluttering praying mantisses you
Will know what I mean.
Travel in Israel is quite cheap
by bus (most of which are British,
you will be glad to know) bat it is
:!so very cheap to hitch and even
! my wagons will stop for you.
Food again is cheap except of
course meat but carp, bred in
local fish farms, provide cheap
protein. Citrus fruits are plenti-
ful, of excellent quality and also
cheap.
As I mentioned earlier, I con-
sider a period on a kibbutz a must
and there are a good many that
will welcome you if you just turn
up. In return for work you will be
given accommodation, your keep
and probably a small amount of
credit to spend in the kibbutz
shop. The ones to try are the
ones with a large fruit crop which
is picked by hand.
As for touring Israel, the places
of Biblical reference are of course
the best bet, whatever your be-
liefs, as they are undoubtedly the
most interesting historically. For
students, Jerusalem is an ex-
tremely good place. There is the
massive Hebrew University
Campus and an exceptional inter-
national folk club which attracts
students of all nationalities as well
as many well-known folk singers.
The one point about Jerusalem
is that hostel accommodation is
already stretched and it is advis-
able to book as far in advance as
possible. Jerusalem is also a stra-
tegic place to run out of money—
you can sell your blood for a very
good price!
I think that whatever your feel-
ings about Israel those considera-
tions should be laid aside and you
should embark on an experience
which should not be missed at
any cost.
