F THE SEXES
Women are what men wake up to find themselves married
to. They too have 2 hands and 2 feet, but also 2 hairpieces,
2 sets of false eyelashes and a whole paraphernalia of other
odds and ends. Not content in being exactly what the others
are, they also insist on doing exactly what the others do.
Though a woman finds it hard to keep a secret, for women
have a keen sense of rumour, one secret she can keep is
her age. Between 30 and 40 is the longest year of her life.
But the years that a woman subtracts from her age are not
lost. They are added to the ages of other women.
A woman is quite content with very little, if that little
is precisely what she wants, if not, then nothing is enough.
The only way to get on with her is to let her imagine that
she is having her own way. The only way to do this is to
let her have her own way. Every woman is wrong till she
cries, then she is right — instantly. A woman never admits
she has lost an argument. She just thinks she has failed to
make her position clear. She has a great sense of right and
wrong, but little sense of right and left.
A woman takes 20 years to make a man of her son, and
than another woman takes 20 minutes to make a fool of him.
Having made a sheep of him, she always tells him he is a
lion with a will of iron. She works 10 years to change a
man's habits, and then complains that he is not the man
she married.
It is true that woman gives to man the very gold of her
life, but she invariably wants it back in small change. It
is hard to teach her that even a bargain costs money.
It is often woman who inspires man with the great things
she will prevent him from doing. She is vogue on the outside
and vague on the inside. She is very much akin to a shadow:
follow her she flies, fly from her she follows. Love is the
delusion that one woman differs from another, and marriage
is the dissolution of any such idea. On one issue, at least,
men and women agree: they both distrust women.
Women are not much, but they are the only alternative
sex. So here's to woman. Would that we could fall into her
arms without falling into her hands.

FRUSTRATION, BRUTALITY,
AND A DIRTY LAUGH
University audiences for
films are now so important
that 20th Century Fox have
taken on 23 year old
Sociology graduate Tony
Orfredi as liaison officer to
British University Film
Societies. This week he
organised on behalf of Fox
an advance screening of
'The Magus' for film editors
and Film Presidents of
various student bodies. This
is going to be a regular
feature and will give Felix
an opportunity to publish
their review in advance of
the dailies.
The Magus from John
Fowles' novel is set in the
beautiful Greek island of
Phraxos and tells of the en-
counters of an English
schoolmaster, Nicholas Urfe
(Michael Caine) with Con-
chis (Anthony Quinn).
well seasoned foreigner
and Lily (Candice Bergen).
A frustrating book has been
turned into a somewhat less
frustrating movie, which
moves rapidly from one
innuendo to the next by way
of passionate encounters
with Anne (Anna Karina),
an airline hostess, to some
gory scenes with the nazis
and culminating in the final
anguish of Nicholas and
Lily.
Conchis a wealthy intellec-
tual owns a villa on
Phraxos, to which he invites
many guests including Lily
and Nicholas. Gradually
during the course of the
film the guests are intro-
duced to Nick, who becomes
more and more confused at
each turn in the road. Just
as he thinks he's solved the
mystery, the whole direc-
tion of the game is moved
by Conchis, who continually
springs surprises on Nick.
The film ends as it begins
with a quote from T. S.
Eliot:
"We shall not cease from
exploration
And the end of all our
exploring
Will be to arrive where
we started
And know the place for
the first time".
This really sums up the
whole enigma that is the
Magus. "Was lit real? some-
one asked after the show.
"What was it all about?"
was another comment. Most
people when they leave this
film will feel that they have
been entertained, but at the
same time they may be a
little non-plussed and will
almost certainly feel
cheated. How should the
film end, even the producer
didn't know, so like the
book he plays with your
emotions and then lets you
down. If one cares to
analyse it one could put a
hundred and one interpreta-
tions on it, but the simplest
thing, I think would be to
say that Conchis wants some-
body to feel the terror that
he felt during the war when
he was told to execute three
Greek Commandos by beat-
ing them to death. He
couldn't do it and so the
Germans shot 80 hostages
and he was left to fight his
conscience for the rest of
his life. He desires passion-
ately to share this pain with
someone and chooses
Nicholas as a suitable victim.
Nicholas must face the test.
Will he punish Lily for her
animalistic unfaithfulness,
or will he throw away the
cat o' nine tails like Con-
chis did the gun.
The screenplay is almost
completely different from
the book and of course weak
by comparison, which is
strange since John Fowles
wrote it. Anthony Quinn
makes a star performance
as a typical Greek, which
makes up in my opinion for
the miscasting of Michael
Oaine, whose cockney accent
tends to stretch the nerves.
This is an intriguing film
well worth a visit.
A film that should really
have been left on the stage
is The Royal Hunt of The
Sun. There is splendour and
savagery in Peter Shaffer's
epic drama in w'hiidh General
Pizzaro (Robert Shaw)
leads an expedition to find
the South American king-
dom of gold. The brutality
of his Spanish army is
stomach turning as they
strike down a thousand un-
armed Incas. The drama
occurs in the relationship
between the captured Inca
God King Atahuallpa (Chris-
topher Plummer) and Piz-
zaro. The situation grows in-
tense as Pizzaro having
promised Atahuallpa's free-
dom in exchange for a room
full of gold, has to search
his conscience when he finds
out that if Atahuallpa goes
free all his men will die.
There is high drama here
and some good acting from
Christopher Plummer, but I
wonder if this is really film
material.
The Virgin Soldiers takes
a sharp look at boys at
war. Playing around with
prostitutes may be fun —
watching your friends being
killed isn't. If you feel like
a dirty laugh don't miss
this one.
CHRIS LEWIS
Men are what women marry. They have 2 hands, 2 feet
and sometimes 2 women but never more than one dollar
and one idea at a time. Like Turkish cigarettes they are all
made of the same materials, the only difference being that
some are better distinguished than others.
Generally speaking, they can be divided into 3 classes:
husbands, bachelors and widowers. A bachelor is an
eligible mass of obstinacy entirely surrounded by suspicion.
Husbands are of 3 types: prizes, surprizes and consolation
prizes. Making a husband out of a man is the highest plastic
art known to civilization. It requires science, sculpture,
common sense, faith, hope and charity — mostly charity.
It is a psychological marvel that a small, tender, soft, violet
scented thing like a woman should enjoy kissing a big,
awkward, stubby chinned, tobacco and rum scented thing
like a man.
If you flatter him you frighten him to death; if you don't
you bore him to death. If you permit him to make love to
you, he gets tired of you in the end; if you don't he gets
tired of you in the beginning. If you agree with him in
everything he says, you cease to interest him. If you argue
with him, you cease to charm him. If you believe all he
says, he thinks you are a fool, if you don't, he thinks you
a cynic.
If you wear gay colours and a mini-skirt, he hesitates
to take you out. If you wear a little brown beret and a
tailored suit, he takes you out and stares all evening at
women in gay colours and mini-skirts.
If you join him in his gaieties and approve of his drinking,
he swears you are driving him to the devil. If you don't
approve of his revelling and urge him to give up his gaieties,
lie vows you are ice and snow.
If you are a clinging type, he doubts whether you have a
brain. If you are a modern, advanced (and intelligent!)
woman, he doubts whether you have a heart. If you are
silly, he longs for a bright mate; if you are brilliant, he
longs for a playmate.
Man is just a worm in the dust. He comes along,
wriggles for a while, and finally some bird gets him.

RECORD
REVIEWS
Basket of Light
The Pentangle,
Transatlantic, TRA 205..
Nine tracks, including five
traditional folksongs and
four more modern pieces.
The main feature is the in-
tricate Jansch — Renbourne
guitar work constrasting with
Jacqui McShee's incredible
voice. Bert Jansch sings on
several tracks, and it takes
some getting used to, sound-
ing reminiscent of some of
the vocal work on the
Incredibles' LPs, but in
many ways it adds substance
to the songs which would
otherwise sound ordinary.
Two very similar songs are
"Once I had a Sweetheart"
and "The Cuckoo" but the
best is probably "Hunting
Song" which features all the
musical talents of the group.
All instruments played are
acoustic but there are one
or two examples of multiple
recording. In short, it's good
value as a stock of LP of
sweet folk music, but no
great step forward.
King Crimson's new LP on
Island is a good example
of how music can be both
progressive and pleasant to
listen to. Although there are
only five tracks, any one is
completely different in style
from the rest, but some drag
on far too long and none
have anything resembling a
good finish. Nevertheless,
it's one of the most original
records produced recently,
and shouldn't be pushed to
one side as being "by one of
those new groups".
Led Zeppelin's second
LP, out Friday, October
24th and called Led Zep-
pelin II (sic), is a classic
example of a record that
must be played on stereo
gear to get the full benefit
of the recording. For those
who really like solid music
with strong vocals and
guitar, this record is a must.
The frrnt side opens with
"Whole Lotta Love", a
rocky number that has so
much stereo panning that
when I listened to it on head-
phones my brain nearly fell
out of my head. The synchro-
nised transitional balance is
evident all the way through
the LP especially on my
favourite track "Ramble
On'.
For those of you who
haven't heard of the group
you should try to hear them.
It is the type of music that
really grips you or bores you
to death. It grips me alright!!
