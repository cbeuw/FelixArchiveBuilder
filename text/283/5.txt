Pontification
It would seem that
pontification on the
subject of scientists' res-
ponsibility is all the rage
at IC at the moment.
Unfortunately the ap-
proach is usually along
the lines of "We should
not do this; it may have
unfortunate spin-offs".
This, I feel, is the wrong
approach. It would be
far more practical for
the scientist to say
say "here is a problem,
what can I do about it?"
This would be a respon-
sible attitude.
To give a specific case,
every scientist is well aware
of the population explosion
on this planet. We cannot
feed the people we already
have, yet we persist in
breeding like rabbits. Every
effort to control this is held
back by lack of doctors, lack
of drugs and the vastness of
the problem. Then, on top
of this, we have blind re-
ligious superstitions and
ignorance telling some of the
worst culprits that they
should not effectively con-
trol their breeding.
What is needed is a birth
control system that the most
ignorant and unwilling can
use. Obviously with a prob-
lem of this magnitude we
can not only have voluntary
birth control, we need some-
thing which must be taken
willing or not. Such a con-
traceptive would either have
to be airborne or in water
supplies. Here, a pill would
be needed to have children;
this alone would stop un-
wanted pregnancies. Then,
by allowing each couple
only two children we could
reduce the population to a
manageable size. This would
possibly restrict liberty, but
surely it would be a small
price to pay to end this
senseless breeding.
"Pius X "
To define anarchism
is impossible. This is en-
tailed in its very concept
— anarchy is freedom,
the freedom of the indi-
vidual — anarchism is
the expression of each
free individual's ideas
and, since no two
people's ideas are the
same, no strict defini-
tion of anarchism can
be obtained.
The requirement of
anarchy is the removal of all
authority, of that God-given
right some men and all states
seem to think they have to
order and direct their fellow
mens' lives.
The gaining of this free-
dom will entail the collapse
of both capitalist and com-
munist systems, freeing
people from their efficient
state-run lives. This may
seem a fearful prospect to
people who have had their
ability to think and make
their own decisions removed
or made redundant by state
propaganda and decision-
making machinery.
If this dependence of
human beings not on them-
selves or on one another but
on an amorphous bureau-
cracy, the state, is not fright-
ening, then its methods of
obtaining your dependence
upon it must be.
State conditioning, while
it has not yet reached the
efficiency of "Brave New
World" is the greatest
threat to individual freedom.
Its aim is to convince people
of the need for a central
controlling authority and
that without this no form of
"civilised" (sic) society could
exist. People brought up in
this atmosphere conceed
their powers of thought and
decision to the state, and
then allow the state to in-
crease its power by remov-
ing any freedom they have
left under the guise of "pro-
tection of the society". Fin-
ally the only freedom re-
maining will be the freedom
to obey the state. People will
no longer be human beings,
but will be mere slaves of
the state.
Anarchism, no matter
what form (mutualism,
anarcho-communism, etc), is
fundamentally opposed to all
authority. It envisages a
society built on co-operation,
not coercion, people organ-
ising themselves by voluntary
agreement. It envisages pro-
duction for the needs of
people, not production re-
turning a profit to the few.
It envisages freedom.

Weekend
Last Friday (24th) at
5 p.m. a coach load of
31 people waited out-
side IC Union for the
32nd. They were ready
to commence the first
ICYHA weekend of the
year.
Later that night, that very
same coach devoided itself of
its load outside a large
studded door, which was the
entrance to the castle of St.
Briavel's in Gloucestershire.
The castle is in fact the Youth
Hostel and although jjarts of
the present building date
back to the 12th century, the
accommodation was by no
means primitive and a cheery
warden and good food helped
all the more to make the
stay a pleasant one.
On the Saturday, the party
split into various groups,
most of whom went down the
River Wye (Tintern Abbey
seemed the main objective),
only to regret it when faced
with the climb up to the hos-
tel in the evening. Luckily
there was a pub next door to
provide entertainment.
On Sunday most people
tried an easier walk; in the
oppressive temperatures of
the day no-one was keen to
exert themselves. As the day
wore on, and a few more
pubs fell to the adventurous,
London's noise and fumes
grew nearer. The four o'clock
deadline was met promptly,
and we hope people enjoyed
themselves enough to try the
next trip.
Although chess is
often thought of in the
popular imagination as
an old man's game, a
very large proportion of
those who play competi-
tively are under 25.
This means that vir-
tually all the Universi-
ties and Colleges in the
country have a chess
team, and IC is no ex-
ception.
The IC Chess club meets
every lunch-time in the room
opposite the Halls of Resi-
dence Office, at the top of
the spiral concrete staircase
opposite Southside main en-
trance, and shares quarters
with the Bridge Club. Mem-
bership stands at about 60,
roughly 50 per cent of whom
are active members of one
of our teams, and the rest
prefer to play just the occa-
sional lunch-time friendly
game.
Two IC teams play in the
UL League, the first in the
Premier Division (of which
we are champions) and the
second in the First Division.
Teams are 8 a side, and
matches take place approxi-
mately once a fortnight.
There is, in addition, a
knockout competition known
as the Pugh Cup (which
name should not be said too
quickly), in which both
teams compete.
IC is the only London
College to enter a team, in
fact two teams, in the Lon-
don League. This is the lar-
gest league in the country,

Copy for what's on for the
period up to December 3rd
with a higher playing stan-
dard than any other league
in Britain, Until 1968, the
IC team was numbered
among the elite of the A
division, but then, in a dis-
astrous year, the first team
was relegated to the B's, and
the second also went down
from the D to the E division.
Last season both teams made
valiant but unsuccessful at-
tempts to re-establish them-
selves. The second team was
very unlucky here, default-
ing a crucial match before
the fixture list arrived!
With the end of last term,
several of the best players
left College, and although an
influx of freshers has
brought the second team up
to strength, the first team is
considerably weakened, and
may have difficulty prevent-
ing the drop into the London
C Division.
The first team has, in fact,
made a rather hesitant start.
On Friday, 17th October
they played Camden Town
in a match, as yet unfinished,
which may end up in an IC
victory, whilst on Friday
24th they played Streatham
in another unfinished match
which looks like it will be
lost.
The second team opened
on Monday, 13th October,
against Atheneum IV, and
won convincingly 6\ to 3^,
despite losing two boards on
default. A subsequent match
against West London II
stands at 5 to 4, to the op-
position, but indications are
that IC will win the remain-
ing game and thus square the
match.
should be in to the Felix rack

Exploration Society Revived
Some of you may
have noticed the decline
and fall of the I.C. Ex-
ploration Society. Last
year, the Society was
completely inactive and
this year seems non-
existent. A completely
new and enthusiastic
Committee has been
formed and we hope to
resurrect the Society.
Basically, it is to be con-
cerned with encouraging and
helping in all ways possible
expeditions from Imperial
College. Lectures will also

be held from time to time.
We would be interested to
hear from anyone who has
an idea for an Expedition
or, of course, anyone gener-
ally interested in joining the
Society (contact via Union
Rack to S. Sparks (GEOL.
ID).
We would like to impress
on you that Exploration does
not necessarily mean taking
an activity from the climb-
ing/surveying/mapping for-
mat. The College has a
very enthusiastic exploration
board, with whom the Soc
iety has had and will have
close connections. The Board

is prepared to finance any
venture, as long as it con-
tains the elements of initia-
tive, adventure and compe-
tent organisation. Any origi-
nal idea involving cars,
photography, t r i c y c l e s ,
climbing, sailing, bird-watch-
ing, in fact virtually any
activity could be a potential
Expedition and will be con-
sidered by the Board.
If you have no idea how
to set about organising one,
contact us. That's what we
are here for to give and
swop ideas, advice and in-
formation. If you have ever
thought of canoeing down
the Orinoco, studying flora
in the Hindu Kush, winning
the London-Sydney Mara
thon or perhaps something
less exotic, just approach us
and you might realise your
dreams.
The Society will officially
be active on November 25th
(to be confirmed) with a lec-
ture by Dennis Kemp on the
Bangor College Expedition
to Peru, I have seen this par-
ticular lecture myself and it
uses highly unusual and en-
tertaining audio-visual tech-
niques and, Photo. Soc. note,
the photography is really
superb. This Expedition was
organised and achieved by
students and they managed
some excellent climbing.
