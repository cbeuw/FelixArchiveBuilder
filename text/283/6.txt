FOOLISH SCHOLARS?
We asked Mike Muller, 2nd Year Guildsman, to write a features article for us, and let
him choose his own subject. The result is below; it concerns everyone training to be a
scientist or engineer and is a balanced observation on the scientists role in society.
There is much talk at
present about 'social
responsibility in the
sciences'; the 'scientists'
lack of conscience';
associated with which
we have the so-called
'crisis of the city' and
the growth of the 'tech-
nological jungle'.
Scientists and technolo-
gists have been singled out
by the public as chief
culprits in the 'rape of the
environment'; pollution of
the ecosphere is slow mass
suicide we're told, and you,
the boffins are leading it.
Even concerned scientists
are predicting an early doom
for mankind as a direct re-
sult of the tampering of their
fellows with natural pro-
cesses that aren't understood.
What are the foundations
for this outburst of opinion?
Well, to take some general
categories, we have pollution
of the air, of the waters, and
lately thermal pollution has
been realised to be as in-
herently dangerous to the en-
vironment and life in general
as the other two. More
specifically, 'scientific' farm-
ing practices are said to
have already upset certain
biological cycles due to the
excessive and indiscriminate
use of nitrate fertilisers and
caused such an accumulation
of DDT in some species of
wild life that it has now
been outlawed as a major
danger to seagulls and fish
in the U.S.A. where it was
once the panacea for all
the farmers pest problems.
There should be no doubt
to anyone with eyes that a
problem, possibly a very
serious one, exists and is
escalating in the fact of in-
difference. What then can we
do, as future (or present)
scientists and technologists,
about this state of affairs?
I suggest that, for a start,
we introduce a new concept
into the game of technology.
We must recognize that the
natural environment has
some intrinsic value. So why
not ascribe a monetary
value to the ecosphere and
regard it as part of your
technological capital. Thus
when you come to design,
say, a chemical works, rais-
ing the level of pollution
in the atmosphere would be
equivalent to destroying
some part of the ecosphere
and the cost of this section
of ecosphere would be a
part of the capital costs of.
the project. Now, you are
in a position where you can
weigh up the profits to be
gained by raising the
material 'quality of life'
against the corresponding
decline in the life-supporting
capacity of the ecosphere.
Perhaps it would be profit-
able to keep the population
permanently on the brink of
choking to death if this
stimulated sufficient demand
for your air-purifying units.
The possibilities are bound-
less. And you would be
secure in the knowledge that
all your pet projects would
eventually become possible
as the fall in value of the
ecosphere (due to capital
depreciation at 6% p.a.) re-
duced the cost of destroying
it.
Planning Utopia
But this is frivolous. The
point I'm trying to make is
that there is little considera-
tion given to the importance
of maintaining our environ-
ment (when did you last
have a lecture (in Engineer-
ing) which emphasised this
aspect rather than the
economic aspect of a pro-
ject?). Material criteria are
no longer sufficient in deter-
mining the direction to be
taken through the multipli-
city of possibilities open to
us in technology and an im-
provement in the material
standard of living no longer
seems to be such a self-
evident virtue. The stage has
been reached where we can
begin to, need to, 'plan our
Utopia' (Marcuse). To do
this we need to look at our
subjects not only in isola-
tion but also as part of
society and question our
roles in the society.
Kant, a while ago, ex-
pressed this problem in the
terms relevant for his era
when the search for 'pure
knowledge' was a perfectly
acceptable role.
'To yield to every whim
of curiosity, and to allow
our passion for enquiry to be
restrained by nothing but
the limits of our ability, this
shows an eagerness of mind
not unbecoming to scholar-
ship. But it is wisdom that
has the merit of selecting
from among the innumerable
problems that present them-
selves, those whose solution
is important to mankind'.
Now all I can see at IC,
and all that is taught seems
to me only to lead to the
blind application of arbit-
rary criteria without any
consideration to their place
in the gestalt; to lead in fact
to producing individuals
whom Kant might describe
as foolish scholars.
Am I wrong? I hope so.
3W1 Again Academic Affairs
"The world will face a
major hunger and unemploy-
ment crisis in the next 15
years unless rich countries
drastically change their
agricultural and trade poli-
cies".
This is the warning theme
of a report issued this month
by the United Nations Food
and Agricultural Organisa-
tion. Yet the crisis is already
with us with 80% of the
world's population starving,
whilst we, the rich 20%, sit
back in our profit-craving
western economic system,
and watch the poor become
poorer. Foreign 'aid' given
by Britain and most other
western capitalist countries,
more often means private in-
vestment so that nice fat
returns are made. Thus in-
stead of the third world
countries becoming richer,
their economy remains static
whilst their resources of raw
materials are exploited for
gain, to go straight into the
pockets of the rich investors.
Thus the gap between the
rich and the poor countries
grows, as it has done in the
past decade.
In mediaeval England, it
was the poor who paid the
taxes, and the rich who re-
ceived them, whilst the "com-
pensation" paid to the
peasants was the privilege of
owning a small plot of land,
and the privilege to work
on the vast Squires' land, at
as low a wage as he could
possibly pay them, without
their starving to death.
To me there is a great
similarity between the local
feudal system of Britain's
Dark Ages, and the world-
wide feudal system of the
20th Dark Age.
The ultimate aim of 3W1
is not simply to raise money
towards O A . , but to urge
the government to modify
and increase its O.A. pro-
gramme, eventually to
attain the target set by the
United Nations of giving 1 %
of our gross national
product, (0.42% at the
moment), and to give it in
a way that does not ask for
large returns. We are there-
fore asking students to give
1 % or more of their annual
income to O.A., and by the
time that 30,000 students are
doing this, it will become a
considerable political force,
and also a large financial
source. Already over Â£1,000
has been raised in I.C. If yen
wish to give or to help,
please contact me.
JOHN THOMASON
On Tuesday, October 21,
the Imperial College
Academic Affairs Committee
held its first meeting. To
celebrate this momentous
occasion, it was decided to
elect Mike Walton (RSM
Acad. Off.) to the posts of
Secretary, Treasurer and
General Dogsbody of the
Committee.
The purpose of the meet-
ing was twofold. Firstly, it
was to discuss the co-ordina-
tion of academic affairs
within Imperial College, and
secondly, to formulate a
number of general policies.
Some administrative changes
were introduced to stream-
line the workings of the
different academic com-
mittees, the most important
being that specific people
now have responsibilities for
specific jobs.
The field of Audio-Visual
Aids is looked after by Tom
Woosnam (Union Rep). This
means that he is concerned
with the collecting and colla-
tion of information on these
Aids, " with particular
reference to their potential
application in the under-
graduate teaching at IC.
Judith Walker (Union Rep)
will be following with in-
terest the development of the
course unit system, whereas
the whole gamut of Vaca-
tion Training falls under the
hands of Harald Marshbaum
(Guilds Acad. Off.).
One of the major purposes
of the Committee is to
assist the general process of
feedback from the student
body to the staff. It is hoped
that this will be done through
the cooperation of the
newly elected IC Depart-
ment Reps. We also hope
that both staff and adminis-
tration will see the Com-
mitee as a means of sound-
ing out student opinion in a
speedy and accurate manner.
We have every desire to
work in full cooperation
with the staff and administra-
tion towards the building of
an academic community.
The report on the Con-
ference on Learning and
Teaching was read out, from
which I should now like to
quote. "The most basic long-
term sugestion is that each
Department should be en-
couraged to examine its
objectives in teachings in its
own field, to consider
whether its present methods
are the best suited to those
objectives and to decide
^whether its methods of
INFORMATION
MUSIC. The entertainments committee hope to maintain a
good standard in groups at the Saturday night dances this
year. Those booked for the rest of this term are:
November 8th Blossom Toes and Alexander Patton
November 15th Edgar Broughton Band
November 22nd Prince Edward's Magic Theatre
November 29th Deep Purple
December 6th Bob Kerr's Whoopee Band
On November 28th East of Eden and the Battered
Ornaments will be playing at the R.C.S. Carnival.
SCHOLARSHIPS: If you think you might like a period of
study at an overseas university the British Council publishes
a booklet giving details of 200 awards tenable at foreign
universities by British Students. The British Council,' State
House, High Holborn, London WC1.
BOOKS: It is sometimes nice to put aside all the heavy
reading and look at something simple. A good place for
this is The Children's Book Centre in Kensington Church
St. They have a really wide selection of books which enable
you, for a short time anyway, to recapture your childhood.
Mayflower paperbacks are shortly bringing out a paper
backed version of Alice in Wonderland with the original
illustrations for only 5/-.
JUMBLE SALES: Jumble Sales can be a very enjoyable
way of spending a Saturday afternoon. Look in local papers
like the Kensington news for details.
PUBLICATIONS: If you've always wanted to be a writer
or get your thoughts into print there is ample opportunity
in the college.
BEENO is produced by the college arts group HENRY. It
is produced on an occasional basis, only coming out when
someone feels like putting it out. It contains poetry, stories,
articles drawings and photographs by people in the college,
but unlike Phoenix it contains everything submitted; there
is no editorship. Go to a Henry meeting if you would like
something in.
CEFE â stands for coming events, future events, it is pro-
duced weekly by the left wing political societies. It provides
comment on things happening in college and gives notice of
future happenings. It is distributed free to anyone who
wants it. Send your name and department to Mike Muller
458 Tizard Hall. Anyone is welcome to help write it on
Thursday evenings in 458 Tizard. CEFE is worth reading
even if you aren't politically minded, since it usually contains
interesting pieces of college news which don't find their way
into Felix.
FELICITY is the Felix late news produced on the Wednes-
day preceding Felix publication day by Tony Kirkham and
John Bowman whom you should contact if you have some
last minute news.
FELIX you know about, people are always needed to write
features and reports and to root out news. Come to a press
meeting on Tuesday or Thursday lunchtime or contact
Malcolm Williamson, in Linstead Hall, Room 634.
Guilds newsletter is one of the constituent college news-
sheets. These contain constituent college union news and
are usually available from year reps., information about
writing for them can be obtained in the relevant union
offices, or from Eric Rossiter, for Mines, Howard Matthews,
Chem., for RCS.
PHOENIX is published twice a year and contains a selec-
tion of poetry, articles, photography and so on by people
in the college. Contributions should be sent to Chris Lewis
in Linstead.
assessment really test the
overall attainment of its
objectives. Such encourage-
ment could probably only
come successfully from the
Board of Studies." It is im-
portant to realise that the
Board of Studies control the
real power in the academic
affairs of this college. For
this reason it is imperative
that we have some represen-
tation on the Board. Unfor-
tunately, however, progress
in this direction has not been
altogether satisfactory.
A further suggestion from
the report was that the
Academic Affairs Officers
should report periodically to
the Deans Committee. In
this respect, the Deans are
the "opposite numbers" of
the Academic Officers, hence
any consultation with them
would be of considerable
value. We intend to pursue
this suggestion in the very
near future.
After one hour and eleven
minutes the meeting closed
(How's that for a Council
Committee?), the next Hains
and Walton Laugh-In being
scheduled for Tuesday,
November 25. Anyone in-
terested in having an
academic affair is cordially
invited to come along!
