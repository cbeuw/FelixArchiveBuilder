At about 11 pan. on Mon-
day, 27th October a scuffle
broke out in the Mews to
the rear of Southside. The
actual reason for the distur-
bance is still not absolutely
clear. A man of, it is said,
Polish origin came out of
one of the Mews' houses,
obviously discontented, and
proceeded to remonstrate
with another man about to
go in. At this point someone
from inside the house came
out, armed with a walking
stick, and a fight ensued —
the outcome being that the
Pole was left outside shout-
ing. By this time virtually
all the residents (and others)
of Southside were watching
the scene, much to the
delight of someone in an
adjoining house, who was
hammering away on a piano
in an effort to entertain the
crowds.

The first carnival collection stunt took place this weekend
when Guilds and Mines went winking down Oxford Street
on Saturday morning,
The prospect of collecting a large amount of money was
hampered on Friday by a threat from the Metropolitan
Police to arrest anyone with a collecting can, however over
80 people turned up on Saturday. Considerable confusion
was created by Mines and Guilds taking opposite sides of the
road and racing the length of Oxford Street. Mines reached
Oxford Circus first and headed for Piccadilly Circus while
Guilds returned to Marble Arch via C and A's.
On reaching Piccadilly a large crowd was drawn by the
spectacle of a group of students winking down the steps into
Piccadilly Underground and winking out even faster hotly
pursued by the Law.
The return journey by tube was further enlightened by
Dennis Taylor and his magaphone announcing the 1969
World Underground Winking Championships as a number
of Guildsmen winked the length of a train.
The day finished with final score of

visits and on one of these
removed the Pole, who was
still seething with discontent,
but latterly had been con-
ducting an i m p r o m p t u
Southside choir in a truly
patriotic rendering of Land
of Hope and Glory, accom-
panied by the fellow at the
piano, to the obvious annoy-
ance of some of the other
local residents. His place in
the Mews was then taken by
none other than the warden
of Silkirk Hall, C. C, Sea-
ford, resplendent in dressing
gown and pyjamas, whose
appearance had the desired
effect of substantially reduc-
ing the volume of noise.
Police officers were seen in
Southside on Tuesday morn-
ing, and the police have re-
portedly been making further
inquiries into certain activi-
ties believed to have taken
place in one of the Mews
houses.

"Why IC should join

Last Thursday Professor
Derek H. R. Barton of the
chemistry department was
awarded the 1969 Nobel
Prize for chemistry. The
prize shared with Professor
Odd Hassel of Oslo Univer-
sity was given for their work
"in developing and applying
the concept of conformation
in chemistry."
Research in this branch of
chemistry was first under-
taken by Prof. Hassel in the
1940's and was continued by
Prof. Barton's work in 1950
on dynamic stereochemistry
whilst a visiting Professor at
Harvard, Prof. Barton's
work has led to develop-
ments in the theory of mole-
cular shapes and three-
dimensional models of mole-
cules and has led to a better
u n d e r s t a n d i n g of how
natural substances such as
steroids, alkaloids and ter-
penes react, Prof. Barton
himself going on to study the
processes in which plants
and moulds synthesize the
natural substances. Prof.
Barton, now aged 51,
was a student at Imperial
College and returned here in
1957 after holding posts at
various other universities.
With typical IC candour he
said that he was not par-
ticularly surprised to hear of
the award — "scientists
usually know where they
stand on the international
pecking order." Judging by
the euphoria and cham-
pagne to be found in the
chemistry department last
Friday, after the public
announcement of the award,
his lack of surprise did not
impede the celebration of his
prize.
Prof. Barton now joins the
hallowed ranks of other
eminent IC scientists who
have also gained a Nobel
Prize, Professor Chain of
piochemistry and Prof.
Blackett, senior research
fellow of the physics dept.
and a scientific advisor to
the government.
I.C.U. Discusses Senate
House Scuffle
The Extraordinary General
Meeting of the Union called
last Thursday verged on
quoracy when Piers Corbyn
opened the meeting.
Piers unfortunately started
with extraneous business on
the Board of Studies and a
motion concerning reciprocal
use of the swimming pool.
Important though these
matters are, in fact perhaps
more vital to EC's interests
than the affair of Sir Dennis
Logan and his relations with
U.C. and University of
Rhodesia that the meeting
had been called to discuss,
these first two motions
caused so much dissention
in the ranks and even
greater dissent in the rank of
John Darley, chairman of
A.C.C., who had been given
no notice of the swimming
pool motion and felt com-
pelled to challenge the
quorum. There was no
quorum — the meeting
closed. Before challenging
the quorum, John Darley
made it clear that he would
not challenge if the matter
was dropped. With all due
respect to John, this was not
the oft heard voice of re-
action scared that its ideas
would be held up to open
ridicule but a genuine feeling
that he, and A.C.C. should
have been given notice of
the motion beforehand. After
all this motion concerned
John's committee as much as
I,C.U.
Low cunning entered in
the form of Keith Guy who
by a laudably intricate move
changed the E.G.M. to a
meeting of the Debating
Society! — with Piers as
chairman. But as Piers
wanted to propose the U.C.
motion, Keith Guy took ihe
chair.
After sufficient heckling
from our still vocal right
and similar, if more con-
structive intransigence from
our increasingly vocal left,
the motions on the floor were
all passed with large majori-
ties, much to the amazement
of all after the haranguing
that had gone on. Of course,
the motions passed were
quite unmandatable and
presumably the second take
of the whole scene will take
place at the next Union
meeting.
