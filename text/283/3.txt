Scientists in Industry
Dear Sir,
Disassociation
Dear Sir,
I would like to remind
Colcutt, that only 2 con-
stituent college unions 'are
planning their typical after-
noon of hooliganism on the
towpath at Putney' this
year.
As far as R.C.S. Union is
concerned, the Morphy Day
towpath battle does not
exist any more, as a motion
was passed at an R.C.S.
Union meeting last year say-
ing that:
'Whilst continuing to
support the Morphy Cup
races, R.C.S.U. dissociates
itself completely from the
towpath battle'.
In my personal opinion, in
passing that motion, by a
very large majority, R.C.S.
Union members showed a
great deal more common
sense than C. and G. and
R.S.M. put together have
ever done in their whole
history.
Further, I hope that R.C.S.
is leaving thuggery and in-
terconstituent college rivalry
far behind, and is heading
towards a new era of res-
ponsibility.
Yours sincerely,
John I. Butterworth
President R.C.S.U.
Distrait
Sir,
Last week I had the for-
tune to try the College Block
snack bar for the first time.
I agree with Mr. Lambert
(Felix — 9 October) that if
you hold the tray back to
front and stop quickly then
cups of tea, yoghurt etc., are
launched in a similar manner
to aircraft from an aircraft
carrier. Also if you hold the
tray upside down (or even
downside up) everything falls
off.
However, if you hold the
try Itihe right way round its
purpose 'is obvious, the tray
is designed to fit on a table.
This brainwave struck me as
I approached the cash desk,
so having paid I sallied
forth triumphant to look for
a place to sit and eat my
delicious Mooney chips.
After dodging round, over
and under customers return-
ing empty trays I had to clear
empty milk packs, yoghurt
cartons (you can make lovely
lampshades with the Ski
ones), knives, forks, plates,
chips etc., to place my tray
with the gravy, milk and
yoghurt quagmire on the
table. I then had the pleasure
of eating my chips. Only two
of us still had our trays.
Why IC students should
be so slow to adopt this new
technique baffles me. The
advantages are obvious:
1) Fewer customers rush-
ing about after emptying
trays, hence less time is spent
in the snack bar and more
customers can be accom-
modated.
2) Cleaner tables.
3) Improved quicker,
easier clearing of tables.
I hope some of the snack
bar customers will adopt the
correct and polite methods of
eating in College Block.

Disillusion
Dear sir,
IC, I am embittered and
disappointed with you. I
now advise anyone not to
come here. I have made my
mistake. A University is, I
believe, a place where a
person's horizons and out-
looks are widened and en-
riched. IC, you narrow and
stifle your horizons. Being
such a large college,
specialising so narrowly and
being in London, you create
an oppressive atmosphere.
There is no 'esprit de corps'
and a lack of (if you'll ex-
cuse the word) loyalty. In-
stead you have established
yourself as a large 'teaching
machine' sucking up sixth-
formers and regurgitating
graduates. Your life largely
consists of work, beer and
sport — Whoopee! — lec-
tures 6 hours a day, study
2 hours a day and that's your
lot.
The Union, that most im-
portant instrument of
s t u d e n t representation,
appears to be in an insipid
state of stagnation — bogged
down in its own anarchy.
101 committees organise
nothing but 101 tons of
waste paper. In a college
with an appalling shortage of
lodgings, totally inadequate
refectory facilities and a
parking system rivalled only
by Westminster City Council,
you merely preach a quasi-
revolutionary feeling which
does not satisfy the left wing
— alienates the right wing
and bores the moderates.
For heavens sake, IC, pull
yourself out of it. I want a
college to be proud of, an
advanced, mature college
not a feeble weak minded
one. You are standing on a
rickety pedestal, and I, for
one, am going to try and
push you off.
Mark M . Wood,
1st year Mining.
Haldane Again
Dear Sir,
Mr. David, in your last
^edition, omits mention of
some facts concerning the
Haldane Library, which we
feel may be of value to your
readers to know.
Before the Haldane
Library came into existence,
the Union ran a fiction
library, staffed by students.
The Haldane then became
responsible for the adminis-
tration of these books, with
the students still providing
some help in staffing.
The student committee
exists primarily to look after
the Union funds (364 titles
were bought last year with
Union money), for which
purpose a student librarian
is elected to coordinate the
fiction buying. The non-
fiction is the responsibility of
the Haldane Librarian, who
is always ready to listen to
recommendations for books.
Last year, however, 36,000
titles were published in
Britain alone, of which the
Haldane was able to buy
850 — in consequence any-
one recommending a book
must be able to justify the
purchase.
Yours faithfully,
Douglas Irish, Chairman,
student committee.
Geoffrey Price, Secretary,
student committee.
Hugh Spikes, Librarian,
student committee.
B.G.A.
Dear Sir,
If you went to the Union
meeting you may have
noticed a B. Hains mutter
something about a Business
Graduates Association semi-
nar. In case you missed this
I have collected one of all
the pamphlets and these
are available from my room
(Linstead 434). Alternatively,
you may write direct to the
B.G.A. at 87, Jermyn St.,
London S.W.I. The aim of
the B.G.A. is "to help to
promote a wider and
accelerated understanding,
acceptance and use of
graduate business in educa-
tion in British industry and
commerce". If you want
some FREE advice on PG
course, grants and career
opportunities in business
administration, then I sug-
gest that you contact these
people as soon as possible.
Yours sincerely,
Brian Hains
Letters to the Editor are
always welcome. They
should be of about 300
words in length, and must
reach FELIX by no later
than the Thursday lunchtime
preceding publication. The
Editor reserves the right to
omit any letter, or to con-
dense it for space reasons.
With the present concern
for the broader education
of scientists and engineers,
it is instructive to consider
the opposite approach. This
would narrow the training
to specific often strictly
vocational courses. The
present allegations that
Scientists are used simply
as problem solvers directed
by the whims of manage-
ment would then become
the literal truth, although
management would also be
similarly trained. The effec-
tiveness and structure of
such a system would be
judged on several grounds.
Firstly, as far as big
Industry is concerned, it
must be as good as the
present system at • solving
specific problems. Assuming
that the competence of the
specialising majority will be
at least as high as the present
more generally trained wor-
kers, the difficulty will
arise with those responsible
for those who are to dis-
tribute the work. These
people must have .a wider,
and certainly less detailed
education. This indicates a
hierarchical educational
system, expanding and up-
g r a d i n g Polytechnics
C.A.T.S., industry - financed
courses, and business
schools, at the expense of
the Universities, which then
become responsible for pro-
viding the more generally
trained 'overseers' and for
research, too complex to
undertake elsewhere (hence
the P.G. population will
rise). Higher management,
responsible for policy
decisions with reference to
the forecasts of attainability
made by our 'general scien-
tists'; will require a very
general education; which
in practise will mean an
Arts degree.
Observant readers will
notice that these postulated
changes are not unlike
present Governmental policy
on higher education. It is
reasonable to suppose that
given the choice of a fully
trained specialist and a
generally educated person
requiring further training,
industry will chose the for-
mer: the postulated changes
in education and the fur-
ther degeneration of scien-
tific work then form a
vicious circle, as without a
very far reaching change of
Government policy the
preference of industry will
once again, as in the past,
dictate the form of higher
scientific education.
That is why it is impor-
tant to arrest the progression
at once by pressing for
broader scientific education
at all higher levels, not just
University. The alternative
is to specialise ad infinitum,
which most people will tire
of sooner or later.
Yours etc.,

"The trouble with Lloyds is that there's nothing to protest about."
LloydsBank say*yes'
to student freedom.
Because Lloyds Bank don't
make charges to students. Our ser-
vices are absolutely free—as long as
your account is kept in credit.
Maybe you don't consider it
worth opening a bank account while
you're on a student grant. It is worth
it. A bank account is by far the best
way of planning, controlling and
keeping track of your spending how-
ever limited your means.
The key is your Lloyds Bank
manager. Financial disasters are far
more easily avoided with a bank
account—plus someone to help you
if you do get into trouble. A Lloyds
Bank manager tends to be under-
standing about the very occasional
and unavoidable overdraft. And if
you're hopeless at managing^
your money anyway, just
ask him — that's his job!
