"Day 4: Subjects
appear quite normal!
That is, large amounts
of food have been con-
sumed and requests
for more are being
made with alarming
frequency".
One might wonder why
the eating habits of two
people should concern a
twenty strong expedition
team and six medical atten-
dants or require three years
planning, or seventeen aqua-
lungs dumped on a barren,
rocky peninsular!
However, perhaps this
will become clear when we
say that these two men were
actually living 20 feet below
the Mediterranean off Marfa
Point, North West Malta.
Their world was a small in-
flatable house, moored in 35
feet of water, looking very
much like a cottage loaf. Its
strength lay in a tough nylon
/neoprene skin attached to a
steel frame. It could be well
described as an 'underwater
tent'.
The house was moored
130 feet from the shor§, but
it could have been 130 miles,
for it was completely isolated
with no airlines or power
cables.
The heart of the system
was a box, about the size
of the average television set.
This contained the life sup-
port system which kept the
two subjects alive and
healthy. Inside were a pair
of emergency batteries which
powered a blower unit; the
interior lights; and an air
purification unit containing
soda lime to remove C 0 2

EXPEDITION

from the atmosphere and
activated charcoal to absorb
trace impurities.
Oxygen was 'bled' into the
house from a cylinder resting
on the sea bed. The main
power unit which was also
outside the house, was a fuel
battery which generated
electricity directly from H 2 +
02 gases. It could run un-
attended for three weeks. The
life-support module was ex-
hausted after twenty four
hours and was replaced
daily.
The expedition was run
jointly between Imperial
College, London University
and Enfield College of Tech-
nology. The teams arrived in
Malta towards the end of
July bringing the first of the
structures strapped to the
roof of the Enfield College
Landrover. Soon the base
camp was established on
Marfa Point and by early
August the first underwater
house S.D.M. Mark I, was
moored at 30 feet in 70 feet
of water, the life support
units had been assembled
and tested.
The Mark I house had
taken four months to design
and build. Many problems
had arisen: for example, the
construction of a frame
sufficiently rigid to take the
loads involved (the displace-
ment of the house was
estimated at 8 tons), yet light
enough to be carried by four
persons. Another complexity
was the prediction of the
behaviour of the skin when
subjected to tensions as high
as 100 pounds per inch. It
was this last problem that
proved the most difficult to
solve; quite a number of mis-
takes were made initially,
but we had learnt by our
experience; a new skin had
to be built before we left
England and arrangements
were made to construct a
new type of frame in Malta,
the combination of these
becoming the S.D.M. Mark
II house.
By August 17th, we were
nearly fully prepared to
begin the underwater living
experiment. The Mark I
house had been submerged
for a week and it appeared
to be as solid as a rock; per-
sonnel had been inside it
for periods of two or three
hours at a time, assembling
the complex internal frame
supporting bunks, table and
hoist, and during this time
the life-support modules had
worked perfectly. The tele-
phone link to the house had
been established and conver-
sation between habitat and
shore was extremely clear.
On shore, members of the
support team had been
allocated their tasks in the
event of any mishap, and a
rota had been drawn up for
the continuous watch which
would be kept once the ex-
periment began.
Wires for lighting, tele-
phones and search-lamps
snaked over the rocks; the
subjects were going yet
again through the procedure
for using C 0 2 & 0 2 meters.
A gentle westerly breeze
had been blowing all day and
a long low swell had
developed. Late in the after-
noon, the wind strengthened
and the sea had become
rougher with frightening
speed. White horeses came
racing into the bay and
breakers dashed against the
low reefs. Two of the most
experienced divers kitted up
and were in the water as
quickly as possible to find
Working outside the Undersea " House "
that the structure on its long
mooring ropes was swaying
about and jerking angrily.
No attempt was made to
enter the house, all we could
do was to wait hopefully
for the sea to subside.
That night, freakish, gale-
force winds swept across the
island and the morning found
15 feet waves rolling into the
bay, the shore installations
damaged, tents down, large
areas underwater and the
diving ladder demolished.
By the following day the
seas had calmed down
enough for a brief recce dive.
Our worst fears were con-
firmed, three of • the six
mooring ropes had snapped,
the house lay on its side,
partly deflated and with the
fabric pierced by the internal
hoops. The house, its moor-
ing, and the life-support unit
were completely wrecked.
However, progress had
been made on the S.D.M.
Mark II house during the
past month. A frame had
been quickly built of a
simpler design, relying on a
more sophisticated mooring
system to spread the load-
ing. The tricky task of
attaching the skin to the
frame had fortunately been
completed the previous week.
Within only one week of
the disaster, it was 'all sys-
tems go' — The Mark II
house was moored at 20
feet and the fuel cell was on
the sea bed ten feet below;
a life-support unit had been
installed and internal fittings
had been built up on the
spot, using 'Dexion'.
However the Mediter-
ranean had not finished with
us yet! Once more a long
swell built up, the prelude to
an even more violent storm.
However, the few brief
hours' warning were suffi-
cient to weight down the fuel
cell, remove the internal
structure and deflate the
Mark II to tie it down onto
the sea bed. We watched the
storm increase in ferocity —
then without warning it sub-
sided suddenly and the air
was perfectly still and the
sea like a mill pond.
Due to these delays, we
were now working against
the clock to get the divers
into saturation. The expedi-
tion personnel were working
fourteen and fifteen hours a
day, and late in the evening
of August 31st the first diver
went down to the house.
There are as yet no text
books written on how to run
an underwater house, nor
even Any tables stating when
a diver becomes saturated.
All we can say is, that, some-
time during the next couple
of days we crossed this
line.
The economics of satura-
tion diving have been spelt
out many times, the decom-
pression time for a saturated
diver is a constant, indepen-
dent of the working time, so
the ratio of working time to
decompression time can be
made large.
We were not working at
depths where this economic
argument could be applied,
but this does not detract
from the validity of the ex-
periment.
From 1st — 4th September
there were two divers living
in the house.
no complaints of sleepless-
ness.
In this thoroughly satis-
factory environment, work
began. The first priority was
to complete the interior
arrangements and thoroughly
check over all the equip-
ment. A 'wireless' telephone
link, the first of its type to be
used, was established to the
shore. When these initial
tasks were satisfactorily com-
pleted, the divers started the
work in hand.
The main project was a
research experiment on diver
irearing; the sea is not the
'silent world' of popular
myth, a diver can hear
Diver's return to the House
Life inside the house was
similar to that of a small
caravan. On entering, the
diver left his aqualung tied
to the mooring ropes, and
climbed in. A freshwater
shower, a towel-down and
some dry clothes, usually
shorts and shirts, would en-
able the diver to remain in
a dry and pleasant condi-
tion.
Food, and even wine, were
brought down regularly and
the occupants brewed up
their own coffee and
chocolate, and often invited
visiting divers to a 'cuppa'.
Because air was not being
pumped into the house, the
source of considerable
irritation in previous experi-
ments, that of the sound of
air bubbling out, was
avoided. A l l was quiet ex-
cept the purring of the air
circulation, the occasional
splash of a fish jumping into
the house and the ubiquitous
'snapping shrimps'. The
aquanauts' sleep was dis-
turbed once each night at
about 4 a.m. for readings
of COz & 0 2 concentration.
Apart from this, there were
the sound of his companions
breathing above the general
crackle of the aforemen-
tioned noisy shrimps!
Tests were carried out 'in
the wet' by divers from the
house and delicate instru-
ments were used 'in the dry'.
Many of the^se operations
were recorded on film, some
of which was shown on
television in Britain; also a
telephone call was made
from the house to Imperial
College announcing our suc-
cess.
The house was in operation
for nearly a week and five
divers spent over 200 hours
underwater, living in the
habitat. The longest con-
tinuous period spent by one
diver was four days. This
was considerably less than
we had hoped. As a result
the organisers are consider-
ing the possibility of operat-
ing the house in United
Kingdom waters. The team
is still largely complete and
much of the equipment is
readily at hand. A l l that is
required is the means to
bring the house back from
Malta and continue the
experiment in Britain.
