EDITORIAL
This year wiH probably see a big step in the development
of the concept of the University of South Kensington. It is
worth considering, therefore, at the beginning of the year the
effect that will be felt at IC particularly in the field of sport.
Although no-one will deny that the veryfinefacilities we have
here should be shared with other colleges so that as many
students as possible can have use of them, I feel 'that care
must be taken to ensure that the original users, i.e. IC^stud-
ents, do not suffer merely for the sake of sharing: as might
happen, for example, if one particular facility was to be over-
used, which would obviously be to everyone's detriment.
One Sided
Although the other colleges in the area have much to offer
in a wide range of fields, they have little to offer to sportsmen
at IC, many of whom feel that reciprocal arrangements are
rather one-sided. In many cases it is the captains of individual
clubs who are being asked to cater for USK students and
the difficulties involved here are, perhaps, not widely realised.
One of the biggest headaches any captain has to cope with
is knowing whether or not a particular player is available for
selection, and it is difficult enough to find whether a student
at IC is available without having to look for people at other
colleges. It must also be noted that most IC clubs enter teams
in UL leagues, in which players from outside IC are not
allowed to compete. No sensible captain will try to build up
a team knowing that it will have to be changed for a league
game.
Other Universities
It is worth considering here, the way sport is run in large
provincial universities, most of which run sport not on an
absolutely centralized basis but generally on a departmental
basis. This is in many cases simply because the numbers to
be catered for are too large for any one club to deal with.
If, therefore, too many USK students are invited to join IC
clubs, the clubs will eventually become unmanageable and
the respective sports will have to be run on collegiate basis,
thus defeating the whole idea of USK. LCD.
Contributions to sports Felix are welcomed from all IC
clubs. Please send them, by Thursday 7.00 p.m. at the latest,
to the Sports Editor, John Darley, Falmouth Hall; although
with advance notice small items can be accepted up to
Friday lunchtime.

Badminton
On Saturday, October 18th, the Badminton mixed team
started off what is hoped to be a good season with an 8—1
win over Northern Polytechnic, away.
Team : G. Georgian, Susan Thompson, S. Donald, Rosanne
Date, P. Poyser, Fiona Mackinnon (capt.).
Last Saturday, 24th, the ladies Badminton team started
their season with a good and close match against Kings
College, winning 5—4 at our home ground, Latimer Baths,
at Wimbledon.
Team: L. Beynon, R. Date, S. Thompson, F. Mackinnon
(capt.), P. Ryall, H. Hutchin.
Hockey
The ladies Hockey team is going from strength to strength
by beating Goldsmiths College, our opponents in last year's
ULU Knockout Tournament Trial, 3—2 at Harlington on
Wednesday, 29th October. The first half showed our team to
be very disorganised with Goldsmiths leading 2—0 at half-
time. However, after a strong pep talk; from the captain, we
finally won 3—2.
Team: J. Buzzard, S. Edwards, J. Mansfield, S. Inskip,
M. Lewis, H. Hutchin, J. Allinson, S. Thompson, L. Beynon,
(capt.), M. Paluch, M. Diggens.
The mixed Hockey is flourishing with ample support from
both our ladies and the men. We Started the season in fine
style with a 2—1 win over Royal Free Hospital and narrowly
lost the two other matches, 1—2 against the Land Registry
(who were obviously more used to the bumps on their pitch
than we were!) and 2—3 against Q.E.C.
ISWSC members: M . Diggens (ca^pt.), H. Hutchin, B.
Dilley, M. Lewis, J. Manfield, L. Beynon.
It is unfortunate that the first natball match, against Chel-
sea on Wednesday 29, was cancelled by them.
ROSANNE DATE
Football
IC first XI went to UC on
Saturday for the first round
of ithe U L cup. Despite being
on top for most of the game,
the team had great difficulty
in finding goal. The whole
team ran well, on a hard,
slippery surface, but the score
remained 0—0 despite ithe
ball staying in the UC half
for nearly the whole of extra
time.
On Wednesday the 1st con-
tinued their league success by
beating LSE 2—0. The fact
that both goals came from
the last 5 minutes showed the
difficulty the* side was having
in scoring goals. This was a
good win for the team, who
now face UC in the cup re-
play on Saturday, Novem-
ber 1st.
The second X I lost 5—1
against LSE II. It is difficult
to see why such a good sat of
players are not having much
success at the present. After
a good start to the season
beating St. Mary's and Pem-
broke the team has lost 8—1
to Bristol II as well as LSE !
A good win against UC is
needed on Saturday to get
back to form.
After winning 11 — 4
against UC the IV continue
their winning run by beating
LSE 4—2.
Note. With over 10% of
players crossing off last Sat-
urday, selection was difficult.
The leagues and cups are
won on consistency; this is
your club, support it by play-
ing regularly.

Volleyball
Strong
The season has got off to
a convincing start, with the
first match played against
Gunners, a team from the
S.E. London Technical Col-
lege, on Friday 17th, being
won by a mixed lsit and 2nd
team. On the following Sun-
day a double match was
played at home against Bor-
ough Road College 1st and
2nd teams. This resulted in a
3 sets to 2 win against their
Ist team and 3 : 0 win against
their seconds.
The first real test for a
strong Ist team took place
on Sunday 26th, in a South-
ern Area Tournament at
Bracknell. We were unfor-
tunate to be under seeded and
had to play the first match in
our pool against Preston, a
National League team play-
ing by invitation. We took an
early lead but they discovered
some weakness and soon we
lost co-ordination and were
soundly beaten. After a quick
tactical talk we continued
into the consolation event
and won it easily. With the
understanding built up in the
tournament it is hoped to
show we have ithe strongest
team in the history of Volley-
ball at I.C., and also to
attempt to test our abilities
against many other British
Universities,

Rugby Club Triumph
Royal Free Hospital 3 pts.; IC 31 pts.
After losing to Royal Free two years running, IC gained
ample revenge on Wednesday as the scoreline suggests. The
whole team played very well and seem to be moulding them-
selves into a more than useful side. The rucking of the for-
wards and ithe running of the backs are particularly good.
IC scored directly from the kick-off, and throughout the
match gave no quarter although some loose tackling by the
back row let the Royal Free backs in for their solitary try.
Our 9 tries were scored by : Roy Anderson (2), Mike Adams
(2), John Gardiner, John Ballard, John Kelly, Keith Devaney,
and Bob Atkins. Two conversions were kicked by Dave
Devlin.
Other team members: Alan Roberts, Terry Stephenson,
Andy Clark, Pete Earl, George Widelski, Steve Owens and
Dave Barford.
On Saturday IC had a block fixture against Rosslyn Park
to which all sides, with the exception of the irrepressible A3
XV, went down rather heavily. Although losing to bigger and
better sides, the scores could have been far more decent if
selected players had turned up to play, and had not crossed
off after 6 p.m. on Friday evening! If the club is to prosper
'this season, some concrete club spirit must be built up —
even though some sacrifices from players may be necessary.

RCS Sixes
The RCS Soccer Sixes com-
petition was held on Sunday,
26th October. Fourteen teams
turned out under a variety of
names, e.g. the doggers,
Fairies, and Lepers, but even
so support was less than i had
been hoped for.
After the first rounds had
been played, the semi-finals
set the Maths 3 first team
against some PG's from Phy-
sics while the Chemistry 2
first team came up against
the Hyde Park Casuals, a
rather casual 'bunch from
Physics,
The results of these games
produced the not unexpected
final between Maths 3 and
Chem 2. /'
Maths took the lead fairly
early in the game, but it was
not long until the equaliser
from Chem 2, after a defen-
sive error. As half time drew
rapidly near, a beautiful cross
shot from Maths' wing
whizzed past the Chemistry
goalkeeper. In the second
half, there were several inci-
dents in both penalty areas,
and about half way through
the half Chemistry scored
from a disputed penalty.
Shortly before the end they
took the lead, which they
were able to maintain despite
Judo
On Saturday, 25th October,
a team of five went down to
Southampton for a contest
against Reading and South-
ampton. Despite ithe small
size of the team, they man-
aged to beat Reading by 25
pts. to 15, and only just lost
to Southampton by 27 pts.
to 20.
There are several import-
ant fixtures coming up soon,
and the club would like more
members, both beginners and
graded, especially those Who
put their names down on
Freshers' Day. Practices are
held every Thursday night for
graded members, and Tues-
day night for beginners, in
the Gym at 6.15 p.m.
valiant attempts by their
opponents, and so ran off the
field the winners by 3 goals
to 2.
In the losers' finals, the
Botany All Stars, few of
whom actually came from
that department, or even from
RCS, beat a Chemistry 1
team by 2—1.
The evening rather degen-
erated after that, when RCS
punch was served to the com-
batants.
Winks Pots on
IC Winks gained its sec-
ond victory last Wednesday,
despite attempts by the oppo-
sition to outwit us with such
daring tactics as playing on
their floor with the dreaded
Japanese Wink (care of
Woolworths). The result was
an overwhelming success by
90| points to 21L This res-
ult was due mainly to good
potting, especially by B.
Pywell, who excelled himself
on their floor.
Our first success was on
the previous Monday, when
Lower Mooney in the Union
resounded to the cries of the
frustrated U L U FreSh-
woman's team as the three
pairs from IC got to work on
the mats. Having removed the
oposition, i IC went on to win
