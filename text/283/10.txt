The photo above shows
the end of the Western
Avenue extension. For its
complete length of 2 miles
this raised motorway is
creating beneath itself a
strip of land which is often
several times the width of
the road above. Yet neither
Kensington nor Westminster
councils had any develop-
ment plans for this space,
which is to be rented to
them by the G.L.C.
Under pressure Kensing-
ton is agreeing to incorporate
several ideas such as a small
park, adventure playground,
and meals on wheel depot,
which were included in a
plan drawn up by a local
pressure group. Nothing
similar is being organised in
Westminster; yet there is
even more space under their
half of the motorway. (The
photo shows the thinnest
portion in Westminster).
Imperial College students,
unlike the tenants of the new
council estate which runs
along the motorway have no
cause to fear the borough
council. And, as members
of the best known centre for
science and technology in
the country, their ideas on
the full exploitation of raised
motorways in an urban set-
ting would carry consider-
able weight.
As a preliminary show of
concern it is intended to
propose a motion at the next
Union meeting (November
13th) deploring the un-
imaginative attitude of West-
minster Council. This will
then need to be followed up
by a development plan for
the mile long site and the
'selling' of this to council-
lors, social workers, news-
papers, M.P.'s etc.
With completion of the
motorway expected during
next year any further delay
in forming a pressure group
will inevitably result in a
council decision to cover
the whole area in grass or
concrete. So come to the
Union Meeting on Novem-
ber 13th and vote for this
motion.
sitar-in Q. & G. Spree
e Indian Society has
The Indian Society has
arranged an evening of
Indian classical music on
the 10th November. Indian
music is a melody and, to
be quiet honest, one cannot
really describe or explain
it. It is something that must
be heard and experienced.
Prolonged effort has
resulted in the many melodic
structures of Ragas. A Raga
is a distinct personification
of various moods. Medita-
tional techniqueenables the
musician to enter into ithe
mood of the particular
Raga, and play it success-
fully.
PERSIAN
The Sitar, the most
popular Indian string instru-
ment, was invented by a
Persian poet-musician, Amir
Kusrau, and was introduced
to India in 1200 A.D.
The number of strings
and their tuning can differ
and is a characteristic of
the school of music to which
the artist belongs.
A typical programme of
Indian music, vocal or in-
strumental, can last anything
up to 8 hours. I have listened
to Ravi Shankar in Bombay
for 1\ hours, playing with
tremendous concentra t i o n
and devotion in and open-
air theatre, when a sweet
breeze from the sea con-
tinuously mingled with the
delicacy of his music to
create a spiritual atmo-
sphere. It is an experience
that will give me joy, and
simply joy, all my life.
ANIL DATE.
The second Guilds union meeting of the term held on
Tuesday of last week was rather poorly attended, there be-
ing a noticeable lack of second and third year Guildsmen.
The result of this was the passing of a motion declaring that
if the publicity officer did not succeed in producing an at-
tendance of two hundred or more for the next meeting he
would be removed to the Round Pond and washed clean
of his sins.
The meeting open, the secretary gabbled through the
minutes of the previous meeting after removing the pencil
from between his teeth, though judging from what one could
hear this was unnecessary.
Concerning Morphy Day the president announced that
an official invitation would be sent to R.C.S.U. challenging
them to a tug of war on the towpath at Putney. Should this
invitation not be accepted a coffin containing the remains of
R.C.S.U. will be ceremoniously consigned to the river bot-
tom.
The meeting was informed of the results of the previous
Saturday's collection in the form of a tiddleyWinks race
down Oxford Street for this year's charity. The seventy or
so Guildsmen who turned up raised some £81.
Phil Smythe then proposed a motion that a protectives
machine should be installed in Mech. Eng. Dennis Taylor
spoke against this appealing to all men, women and Children
of Guilds to solve the problem by other means. Despite the
suggestion that the machine should be installed in the coffee
room and disguised as a coffee machine the motion was de-
feated by 36 votes to 31, a large number of people abstain-
ing.
There being no other business the meeting was closed
with the usual rendering of Boomalaka and with the unusual
sight of D. Taylor actually succeeding in lifting Bolt.
Linstead selection
At a meeting of the Lin-
stead Hall Committee last
week it was decided to in-
crease the number of stu-
dents on the Hall selection
committee to six. Three of
these will be Linstead Hall
residents and the remaining
three will be from other
Halls. It was also recom-
mended that the number of
students allowed in for a
second year be reduced to
10%.
Sparkes Flies at B.O.S.
'They are a load of idle
layabouts!" — "Hobby sub-
jects!"
So said Prof. Sparkes
(Dean C. & G.) on students
and Prof. Barrer (Head of
Chemistry) on non-specialist
subjects at a half hour dis-
cussion on diversification
preceding the Board of
Studies meeting on Wednes-
day 29 Oct. The discussion
was arranged at the request
of the President and was at-
tended by President Piers
Corbyn, Academic Affairs
Officer — Brian Hains, one
of the writers of the report
on Non-Technical Studies —
Dave Wield, and two mem-
bers who taught non-main
course subjects: — Sinclair
Goodlad (Elec. Eng.) and J.
B. T. Cole (Chem. Eng.).
The President had requested
beforehand that they be al-
lowed to stay for the board
meeting proper "in the spirit
of what was suggested in
the Rector's letter of 29th
July" but this request was
not granted.
STUDIES
The discussion was con-
cerned with last term's
student "Report on Non-
Technical Studies" and a
short memo by Piers
Corbyn and Brian Hains on
diversification. The President
introduced the subject say-
ing that there is growing
pressure and feeling (e.g.
many govt, and other re-
ports) from outside bodies
in favour of extensive
diversification of both a
"science-generalist" type and
a type to give "an overall
view of knowledge and pro-
mote a more critical socially
aware and socially respon-
sible attitude". Comparable
institutions (e.g. MIT) have
long since diversified; the
board was asked "Why is IC
so far behind?" In addition
to this there is a very strong
student opinion (according to
last term's pilot question-
naire) in favour of diversi-
fication. There are large dis-
crepancies between depart-
ments in the present extent
of diversification, which
puzzles students; the board
was asked for the reasons
for discrepancies and to say
what it intended to do about
it. The memo to the board
was then outlined — it sug-
gests strengthening the
course unit structure and
setting up a college financed
"school" to force diversifica-
tion — and again they were
asked by the President what
they intended to do about it.
The students felt that the
response of the professors
was disappointingly illiberal
and uneonstructive. Prof.
Barrer (Chemistry) believed
that diversification would
lead to a lowering in the
scholarship and character of
the course, and described
diversification as "hobby
subjects" — which were for
leisure time only. Prof.
Flemming (Min. Tech.) was
very critical of the pilot
questionnaire itself. Prof.
Sparkes did not want
"hurried action" and thought
that General Studies were
quite adequate, the fact that
many students did not attend
proved to him that they were
a "lot of idle layabouts". It
was suggested by someone
who went to the meeting
that as President of the
Rugger Club, Prof. Sparkes
would like to stop all Tues-
day and Thursday practises
to enable rugger-players to
attend G.S.
GO ELSEWHERE !
Prof. Alexander (Mech.
Eng.) thought that the stu-
dents who wanted diversifica-
tion should go elsewhere !
Most other comments were
unfavourable to diversifica-
tion and the delegation of
three students and two staff
felt that too little time was
given for reply or discussion.
Many Profs, said they
wanted more discussions
later. However after the
delegation of 3 students and
2 staff left the discussion is
rumoured to have improved,
and it was decided that the
Pro-Rector should "co-
ordinate the present ar-
rangements, and by means
of regular meetings with the
staff involved with these
activities explore what can
be done to meet the increas-
ing demand for an extension
of the non-technical Studies
provision within Ithe existing
resources available (as was
reported to the E.G.M.). Ad-
ministrative support for his
responsibilities would be pro-
vided by the General Studies
office. It was also noted that
proposals on the matter were
being considered for the next
quinquenium.
Some professors at the
meeting were sceptical about
student support for the pro-
posals but forward, so it
was fortunate that the
E.G.M. the next day it was
possible to overwhelmingly
ratify the memo to the
BOST and make strong
comments on the subject
which were relayed to the
Pro-Rector the very next
day.
Lord Mayor's Show
1
This year Guilds have
persuaded (?) the organisers
of the Lord Mayor's Show
to let them have a float in
the pageant section of the
procession. The float will be
preceded by 'Bo' and the
theme is "Swinging Lon-
don", sponsored by the Bri-
tish Travel Association.
The float itself features a
colourful and exciting 'bouti-
que cum disco' with equally
colourful and exciting
Guildswomen.
Over the last weekend
the Evening Standard and
News took photographs of
the float in an incomplete
state (after an all-night
attempt to get it ready. This
was cleverly disguised by
numerous strategically placed
persons and Dermott Corr
doubling as Eros.
The floats will assemble
in the Tower Bridge area on
Friday afternoon, and are
then taken by police escort
to London Wall, where they
will join the main procession
at approx. 11.30 a.m.
The Organisers stress that
no Street collections be taken,
and Guilds will be out in
force with collecting cans.
Any Guildsman / woman
interested in selling pro-
grammes in the St. .Pauls
area during the show should
call in at Guilds Union
Office as soon as possible
before Nov. 8th.
