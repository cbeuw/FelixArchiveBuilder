Billy Bragg
What is Billy Bragg (the big nosed
bastard from Barking as he is
affectionately known) waiting for?
He never wanted to grow up, or so
it seemed from his early albums. He
sang of the preservance of
innocence until he turned to politics.
Not that politics wasn't there from
the beginning, it's just that when
every other song was political it
made him tedious.
Now it seems we have the old
Billy back. Back but matured and
realising that he has to grow up and
take his place. He also admits that
his politics aren't as clear cut as they
used to be. Billy Bragg is still an
! idealist though, thank God, and he
j still has the odd touch of nostalgic
i melancholy; 'all my friends from
school introduce me to their
spouses', and the little bits we can
identify with that makes any writing
great.
This album is user-friendly, you
get used to it almost immediately.
Then his small phrases make you
smile and his is-it-put-on accent
amuses you, then you realise you
understand the song—a rare treat
with contemporary music.
The LP ends with Waiting for the
Great Leap Forward—our world in a
song—brilliant. What is Billy Bragg
waiting for? Who knows, but if he
wants any company....

Energy
Orchard
The Marquee
Think (for a moment) of a caged
animal and one in the wild in its
natural habitat. Energy Orchard are
not animals, but their gig at the
Marquee last Tuesday definitely
lacked the same bursting energy
and honest fun which came over
when I saw them two months ago
in a North London pub with
hundreds of screaming, dancing,
happy Londoners with a heavy bias
towards across-the-water, and when
the lead singer greeted us with
'Hello Belfast', I knew it was time
to finish my bitter and get onto the
Guinness. By the time they
launched into their final song, I was
hooked—a lively band, breaking
new ground, and enjoying it. 'You
mean they don't sound like U2 or
the Pogues?' I hear you cry. You'd
better believe it!
Things have been moving fast for
Energy Orchard, and last week they
played the new Marquee Club in
Charing Cross Road. It was a big
showcase night for them, and a
bigger crowd would have helped,
but as they say, you can't keep five
good men down. They'd come to
play their best and enjoy
themselves, even if the pseudo
trendy crowd were only there to
debate the finer points of Gaelic
origami.
After an habitual 'Hello Belfast'
(one reply), they were off into a
good rockin' story of a cowboy
called Mag Nagaho. Fast, furious
and great to sing along to. The
spellbinding showies, especially
King of Love and Shipyard Song are
full of strong lyrics with moody
guitar backing. Tear jerking stuff. A
blues harmonica player made a
guest appearance, getting the
second biggest applause of the
evening second only to the death
defying jump off the speaker by the
lead singer in the encore.
The whole set blended into an
hour and a half's solid
entertainment, only pausing to
check if the crowd was any bigger.
Alas, their poetic, energetic guitar
playing efforts were enjoyed by a
laid back collection of fans, tourists
and music bizz types.
With interest from all parts of the
mega-industry, they are fast
becoming a contender for a
marketing idiot in a ridiculous suit
• saying 'let's give 'em a complete
image change and sell them to little
girlies'. God forbid. They aren't that
stupid and they probably aren't into
screaming ten year olds.
Stop Press....The grapevine tells
me Energy Orchard could soon be
playing at IC, courtesy of that crazy
Ents Crew. So book your place for
the greatest thrill of your lifetime.
'Of course, I saw them when they
were just starting out'...Shut up
grandad!

The Royal Opera has embarked on
the mammoth project of staging a
new production of Der Ring des
i Nibelungen, the first quarter of which
• musical marathon is being
: performed at the Royal Opera
: House, covent Garden this month.
Das Rheingold is an everyday story
of gods, dwarves, giants,
Rhinemaidens and Mother Earth. It
has all the elements of a good
thriller: murder, lust, high stakes
and a dwarf that turns into a frog
which bears more than a passing
resemblance to Kermit! Moreover,
there are some thumping good 'take
home and hum in your bath' tunes
to boot.
Luybimov's production is modern
and visually exciting. Certainly most
of Wagner's technical challenges
(such as the transfer of action from
river bed to mountain top in three
minutes of music) are well met.
Distant action is revealed beyond
and characters enter through an
ingenious opening and closing 'iris'
and an hydraulic 'ring donut' centre
stage is used to good and varied |
effect.
The music is pretty spine-tingling
too; clear conducting and
particularly fine performances by
James Morris: Wotan (top god),
Kenneth Riegel: Loge (fire god),
Ekkehard Wlashihi: Alberich (the
ugly dwarf who makes an
unsuccessful pass at the
Rhinemaidens but a useful ring
from the Rhinegold) and Jadwiga
Rappe: Erda (the green faced torso
who warns Wotan to be careful). By
the way she then bears him nine
daughters called the Walkiire and
headed by Brunnhilde!.. .but that's
another story (well, part 2).
So, for all you trendies out there,
hitherto uninitiated into the joys of
opera, impress a friend and get a
couple of tickets; there is plenty
coming up. For £2.50 in the upper
slips it must be one of the cheapest
evenings out in London and you
might even enjoy it.
