The FELIX
Review
London Student has been relaunched.
ULU have installedflashynew desk
top publishing equipment, the
paste-ups are now done in-house
and a trendy new format is the order
of the day. But what of the content?
Previously London Student has
been awful. The news coverage was
non-existent, mostly consisting of
press handouts from student unions
who could get hold of a reporter

(London Student have the most
elusive staff in any publication I
have come across and those you can
reach 'don't have anything to do
with news, can't help you mate').
Most of the rest of the paper was a
left-wing review of unheard of
bands.
The new London Student has a
greatly expanded news section. The
articles appear to be well informed
and fairly well written. There does
remain a tendency to thrust
opinions on to what should be
unbiased reporting. For example, a
space filler on Mrs Thatcher's new
conversion to environmentalism
'1500 dead seals can't be wrong'.
The leftish reporting extends to a
catalogue of mergers imminent or
proposed within London.
Features are immensely
improved. Previously London
Student ran little or no features at all
and the few that there were seemed
to be in-depth interviews with the
latest rising star in NUS London.
These days features are greatly
expanded upon with inteligently
written articles from a wide range of
student writers. Despite
inaccuracies, the features are by far
the most interesting part of the
newspaper, with several lectures
worth of reading, including
personal safety, food, cycling and
pop art.
The usual extensive and
uninteresting travel section remains
as before but the reviews and
listings have been greatly increased,
even encompasing music and
videos heard of by the student in the
street. An interview with Andrea
from the Darling Buds retains the feel
of 'pop nouveaux' but the listings
include a wide range of tastes. One
hopes London Ents officers keep
this page to up-to-date and accurate.
The layout owes much to the
Guardian, even including
typesetting errors. The paper is
generally visually good but the
effect is spoilt somewhat by abysmal
pasting-up. I suppose they lack the
years of inherited experience at
FELIX, but there is little excuse for
crashing blocks of text into the
pretty dividing squares. Perhaps we
should go and show them how!
Overall the paper is a huge
improvement from the cliquey,
badly written London Student of last
year but more attention to design
and unbiased news reporting could
make it excellent. I look forward to
reading London Student each
fortnight which is much more than
I could have said before.
