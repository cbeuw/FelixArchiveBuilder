People who after reaching one height look eagerly for the next.

corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions, capital markets, sales and trading,
or banking technology and operations.
You'll have the chance to prove yourself right away. You'll find the
atmosphere charged with excitement. And the people talented and energetic.
