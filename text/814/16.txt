We're still
here!
Owing to a series of administrative
errors last term we were unable to
be at Freshers' Fair, but I would just
like to say that Astrosoc is alive and
well at IC.
This year we will have regular
Tuesday lunchtime lectures at 1pm
in Physics Lecture Theatre 2 (in the
basement), beginning on Tuesday
October 25 at 1pm with a lecture by
Dr R C Smith from Sussex
University.
SOCIALIST
Varied Views
As you might have seen, there are
a number of right-wing groups in
College this year and not many
people to oppose them. The
Socialist Society can bring together
people with varied political views
from Labour through to communist
In addition to these we hope to
visit some places of interest to our
members, such as the Royal
Greenwich Observatory, and we
may even get some observing done
with our own refractor.
Membership this year is £1.50 and
this entitles members to all events
free of charge. If you have any
questions concerning Astrosoc,
don't hesitate to contact me, Daren
Austin, via the Physics pigeonholes.

and anarchist. If you are interested
and your political views can roughly
be described as socialist please
contact Ian Widdows, Physics 2.

Adopted
Prisoners
This week is Prisoner of Conscience
Week, when Amnesty groups all
over the world put special emphasis
on their adopted prisoners.
Amnesty adopts people who are
imprisoned for non-violent
expression or their political or
religious beliefs, or because of their
colour, race or sex.
Imperial College Amnesty
Group's prisoner is Alaattin Sahin,
a chemical engineer in Turkey.
During 1977 he edited a political
journal called 'Halkin Yolu', or
'People's Way'. After the military
coup in September 1980 he was
charged with making communist
propaganda and convicted, being
sentenced to 36 years on appeal.
When the journal was produced in
1977 it was legal.
It was fairly common practice after
the coup for journalists to be
charged for material they had
produced prior to the military take
over.
Amnesty International has no
evidence that Alaattin Sahin ever
used or advocated violence, indeed
he was a member of The Turkish
Workers and Peasants Party, a
group opposed strongly to political
violence, so Al have adopted him as
a prisoner of conscience.
If you would like to write on behalf
of Alaattin Sahin, please send
courteous letters asking for his
immediate and unconditional
release.
Letters should be addressed to:
Mehmet Topol,
Minister of Justice,
Ministry of Justice,
Adalet Bakanlyi,
Ankara, Turkey.
The Imperial College Amnesty
Group meets every Tuesday at
5.30pm in the Brown Committee
Room. For more information,
contact Radha Chakraborty (Maths

W.I.S.T.
Bra-Burning
Feminists??
There will be a meeting of W.I.S.T.
(Women in Science and
Technology) on Monday October 24
from 12.30-1.30 in the Green
Committee Room on the Top Floor
of the Union Building. The meeting
is to discuss our programme of
events for this year.
Apparently, in the past, members
of W.I.S.T. had a reputation of
being bra-burning feminists. This
year, I would like to see the Society
representing a larger proportion of
women at IC. So don't be put off the
Society if you're not a feminist—I
could hardly be described as
'militant' myself. We are not a
group of man haters either. In fact,
men are perfectly welcome at our
meetings, as long as they are
genuinely interested in the issue
under discussion.
This year's Committee are:
Chairperson: Lindsey Wishart
Treasurer: Sarah Liebert
Secretary: Jo Cocup
And finally, the Society depends on
its members, so come along on
Monday and see what you think.
J A Z Z & ROCK
1,2, 3,
Testing
Many popular bands today have
emerged from colleges and
universities and one of the most
successful (whatever your tastes), .
Queen, was from IC. Although the
Jazz and Rock Club has not
nurtured anyone quite so prolific in
recent years, there is still hope. The
Club is the place for musicians and
would-be musicians who want to
play and sing, outside classical
constraints, or just thrash their leccy
guitars.
The College are presently
furbishing a new rehearsal room in
Beit, which the Club will equip with
a drum kit, 150W PA, microphones,
a digital delay, a Fender Rhodes
piano and a new Roland D-10
digitial synth. There is also storage
room for members' equipment.
The Club arranges a gig every
term so bands can perform with full
PA and lights, and a member can
also play at various other Union
events. Last year there were more
than ten bands rehearsing in the old
Jazz Room; some getting out and
gigging regularly, while others, very
wisely, never left the confines of the
room.
Anyone who would like to find
out more, or join, should contact
James Stewart EE 2, or come to the
Union Lounge on Monday at
12.30-1.30.
