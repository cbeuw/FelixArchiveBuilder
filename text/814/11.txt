Opinion
I s l a m
An opinion article by
Islamic Society.
Let me begin by clarifying that for
us Islam is not the name of some
unique faith presented for the first
time by Mohammed. The Quran
makes it abudently clear that Islam
is the one and only faith consistently
revealed by God to mankind from
the very beginning. Noah,
Abraham, Moses and Jesus —
Prophets who appeared at different
times and places—all propagated the
same faith. They were not the
founders of faith to be named after
Islam is the one and
only faith consistently
revealed by God to
mankind
them. They were each reiterating
the faith of his predecessor.
What distinguishes Mohammed
from other Prophets?
(i) He was the last Prophet of God,
(ii) God revived through him the
same genuine faith which had been
conveyed by all the Prophets, (hi)
this original message was corrupted,
and split into various religions by
people of different ages, who
indulged in interpolations and
admixture. These alien elements
were eliminated by God and Islam,
in its pure and original form, was
transmitted to mankind through
Mohammed, (iv) since there was to
be no messenger after Mohammed,
the Book revealed to him was
preserved word for word so that it
should be a source of guidance for
all times, (v) the life of Mohammed
and the manner in which he
conducted himself, was also
recorded in a unique manner by his
companions and by later compilers
of the Tradition. A more complete
We believe in all the
Prophets who
preceded Mohammed
and authentic account of life, saying
and actions of any Prophet or
historical personage has never been
compiled, (vi) in this, way, the
Quran and the authentic Sunnah of
the Prophet together became a
reliable source of knowing what is
Islam, what it stands for, what
guidance it provides, and what
obligation it places on us.
As Muslims, we believe in all the
Prophets who preceded Moham-
med—not only those who are
mentioned in the Quran, but also
those who are not so mentioned—
and this is such an integral part of
our faith that if we were to abandon
it we should cease to be Muslims.
But for instruction we turn to
Phrophet Mohammed alone not on
account of any prejudice, but
because as the last of God's
prophets he brought us the latest
divine dispensation, the word of
God which reached us through
Mohammed is pure divine
language, free of human
admixtures, and preserved in its
original form.
As I have said earlier, we have a
complete historical record of the life,
character, conduct, sayings and
actions of the Prophet Mohammed,
preserved with meticulous care,
accuracy and detail. Since this
cannot be said of other Prophets we
can believe in them, but we cannot
emulate them.
It is our belief that Mohammed's
mission was for the world as a
whole and for all times; for, (i) its
universality has been clearly
confirmed by the Quran, (ii) it is a
logical consequence of the finality of
his prophethood. A Prophet, after
whom there was to be no other, had
to be guide and leader for all men
and for all ages, (iii) God has
provided through him a complete
code which man needs to follow the
right path and this in itself supports
the concept of finality, because
without completeness, the need for
other Prophets would remain, (iv)
it is a fact that during the last 1400
years no man has arisen whose life
and work bears even the slightest
resemblance to that of a Prophet.
Nor has anyone presented a book
which could be remotely considered
as divine communication. Still less
has there been a man to claim
legitimate authority as a law-giver
for mankind.
It must, at this point, be
understood why the need arose for.
God to communicate with man
through His Prophets. This has to
be examined in the context of the
sources of human knowledge. At
the preliminary stage we gain
knowledge through empirical
observation. At higher level comes
deductive reasoning accompanied
by scientific investigation. Man is
sufficiently well equipped in these
fields not to require direct divine
assistance. Though, no doubt, there
The Prophet
determines the rules
which should form
the basis of social and
cultural relationships
is an ever present divine will
helping man in his research and
innovative endeavours and
revealing to him progressively the
mysteries of His creation. Some
gifted individuals achieve, in
moments of rare inspiration, new
insights or discover new laws of
nature. But there is another type of
knowledge which is beyond the
reach of our senses of scientific
study. This sphere of knowledge
does not submit to any instrument
of scientific examination.
Philosophy and science can only
speculate about it. Human theories
about ultimate realities, based on
reason, never achieve the level of
certainty, and their authors,
conscious of their limitations, do not
present them as conclusively
proved. In respect of these realities
man is dependent on whatever
knowledge is communicated to him
by God. How is this knowledge
conveyed? Not through the
operations of some publishing
house, where books are printed and
handed over to each man, with
instructions to read them, and to
discover the truth about himself,
about the universe and about the
manner in which he should organise
his life. To convey this knowledge
to mankind God chooses Prophets
as His messengers. He reveals the
truth to them and they
communicate it to the people.
The work of a Prophet is not
limited to communication of
knowledge alone. He has to explain,
according to what is revealed to
him, the relationship between God
and man and man and man as it
factually is, and as it actually should
be. "
