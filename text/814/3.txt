The Print Unit. The FELIX Print
Unit is available for the use of all
clubs and societies. If you would like
any printing carried out then drop
in on a Monday or a Friday to book
in work and discuss requirements.
If you call in at any other time then
I will probably not have time to see
you as I will be fujly engaged in
producing FELIX.
IC Union clubs have printing
carried out at cost price, providing
they are prepared to lend a hand
with the artwork, trimming and
folding (if required).
In addition to printing, we also
have a photocopier with the option
of blue, red or black toner. If you
would like some photocopying,
drop in on Monday or on Friday and
fill in a photocopy request form.
Thanks to a kind donation by Mr
Oakley, the Chemical Engineering
Departmental Superintendent, the
print unit can also offer the use of
an A4 collating machine.
FELIX. A few students have pointed
out that they are interested in
helping out on FELIX but are unsure
when to drop in. Wednesday
afternoons are usually the most
busy, but we also need people
throughout the week, particularly
on Tuesday evenings, and on
Thursday mornings and afternoon.
We need writers, proof readers,
reporters, photographers, layout
artists and people to help with
folding and collating. No previous
experience is necessary—we can
teach you everything.

The Manufacturing, Science and
Finance (MSF) Union held a day of
action at College last Tuesday in
pursuit of an 18% pay claim.
The strike was supported by 95%
of those voting in a ballot and
sympathy from staff and
postgraduates according to Ian
French, the London National
Representative.
As part of the day of action a
motorcade drove around the
College, speeches were made by
Paul Talbot, the MSF National
Officer and a message of support
was read from Clive Jenkins, the
retiring MSF Union President. The
day was concluded with a petition
delivered to the Department of
Education and Science.
Chemistry
Dramatic increases in the intake of
thfe Chemistry department have
lead to a possible review of the first
year chemistry laboratory.
The intake for the Chemistry
department has risen from 89 to 117.
College Senior Tutor, Dr Goodgame
told FELIX that the laboratories were
filled to their capacity of 116 but
there had been no complaints from
students.
Dr Barry, Senior Tutor of the
Chemistry Department told FELIX
that the laboratories are 'packed
out'. When asked about library
facilities, Dr Barry said there would
be 'more of a squeeze.' Lecture
theatre space has not been a
problem for the department, which
non-teaching staff at IC, is seeking
the second part of the 1988 pay
settlement which would equate
them with industrial counterparts.
An 18% pay rise is borne out by
findings from an independent
survey.
The MSF wished to pressurise the
College to fight their new claim with
the Department of Education and
Science. Robert Jackson MP, the
Minister of State for Higher
Education, claimed he had not
received such a case when met by
officials from IC.
The Rector Professor Eric Ash told
FELIX that all university staff are
underpaid, something he believed
was against Britain's long term
interests.
has theatres capable of seating over
150 students.
College Assistant Safety Director,
Ian Gillett said that the problem of
overcrowding in the first year
chemistry laboratory was 'under
review.' He added that the
department is providing the
recommended ratio of 1 supervisor
per 15 students in the lab.
Dr Barry concluded by saying that
it was 'early days' to be considering
the problem of overcrowding. He
added that he was expecting a
similar . intake next year, unless
College policy changes. The
indications are that the policy will
remain the same.
Students to
pay tuition fees
Students may have to pay
university tuition fees under a
scheme proposed by Lord Chiver in
the Times Higher Educational
Supplement, last week. Lord Chiver,
the Vice-Chancellor, of Cranfield
Institute and Chairman-Elect of the
Universities Funding Council
rejected the Robbins principle,
central to higher education of the
last 25 years, stating that ability
could be judged by willingness to
pay.
The Robbins principle, that higher
education 'should be available to
those qualified by attainment and
wish to pursue' is an inviting
philosophy said Lord Chiver. His
scheme favours serious students
over those who take education for
granted and would save money.
He accepts that some of those
who are willing to pay, would not
be able to, but considers the
proportion small, and see the
Government's role as one of
providing 'charity' for those who
genuinely cannot afford to go.
No water in
Northside
Maintenance staff discovered a burst
water main and flood in the
Basement of 15 Princes Gardens on
Wednesday night. The Waterboard,
unable to repair it immediately,
were forced to cut off the mains
water to Garden, Linstead and
Weeks Halls. However, the Halls
have sufficient storage capacity to
ensure that serious shortages did
not occur. The Waterboard finished
their repairs and had the supply
restored by Thursday afternoon.
IC collects for
charity
A London-wide charity collection
hosted by Imperial College raised
£30,000 for Mencap last Saturday.
The collectors came from
Universities and Polytechnics across
the country, including
Loughborough, Warwick,
Southampton, Bangor and Essex. IC
Rag provided 21 collectors, raising
over £750.
The collection was followed by a
party in the Junior Common Room
(JCR)."
