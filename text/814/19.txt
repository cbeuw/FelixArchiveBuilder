IC Rent
Strike?
A motion calling for the College to
use the income generated by taking
on more students to subsidise
accommodation is to be debated at
Tuesdays Union General Meeting
(UGM). The motion states that the
proposal should be taken to
Governing Body and unless policy
is agreed, it calls for a College wide
rent strike.
The motion explains that the
revenue generated by taking on
more students is approximately
equal to the extra cost of housing
them. At the moment the College
benefits from the funds brought in
by increased student numbers but
the bill for the required extra
accommodation has to be paid for
by increasing student rents.
Members of the College finance
section and the Rector have been
invited to speak against the motion.
Sources within the Union suggest
that an ammendment calling for the
accommodation levy to apply to
Overseas students only is being
considered. Such an amendment, if
taken up by the College is likely to
lead to a reduction in the number of
Overseas students at IC.

Fishy
Wishy
The Chairman of the Imperial
College Governing Body, Sir Henry
Fisher MA, officially opened Fisher
Hall last Friday. Before unveiling a
plaque, Sir Henry made a short
speech. When speaking of his
concern over the accommodation
problem at IC he said 'If we can't
house our students and lecturers
they can't come.' He added that it
was a 'rather pleasant experience'
to have a hall of residence named
after him.
Imperial & Mary's
officially merged
Princess Anne announced an
accommodation appeal fund for
Imperial at the cerjemony to
celebrate the merger of IC and St
Mary's Hospital Medical School
(SMHMS) on Wednesday.
She spoke of the need for
adequate accommodation for
students, particularly for
postgraduates.
She went on to emphasise the
need for continuity, saying that
'traditional strengths would form
the backbone' of the merged
institutions, and said that the talent
in both colleges indicated an exciting
future.
The Rector of IC, Professor Eric
Ash, in his speech expressed delight
at such an 'exhilarating occasion',
while the Dean of S M H M S ,
Professor P Richards, referred to the
'academic excellence, intellectual
and cultural diversity and the
humanity and dedication' that
would abound in the new College.
Imperial College Union President
Nigel Baker welcomed the
Chancellor's remarks on
accommodation. He also said that
although the Students' Unions of IC
and SMHMS had not yet merged,
they were working their problems
out and that the merger would be
complete by 1 August 1989.
Beit Hall joins the rent
row frvrtT!
Residents in Beit Hall are
considering joining Fisher Hall in a
move to withhold the payment of
part of their Hall bills, the students
are angry that they were not
informed of increased rents—12%
greater than last year—when they
accepted places in Beit. They are
unhappy with the College's decision
to charge for an extra week's rent
over the Christmas holidays.
Two of the residents pinned a
petition up in the Beit Hall Common
Room on Monday night, asking for
comments on the new rent levels.
The petition has been signed by 31
residents who estimate 'reasonable'
rent levels to lie between £30 and
£35 per week as opposed to the
current £37 per week.
As explained in last week's FELIX,
the decision to charge an extra
week's rent was taken by the
Student Residence Committee in
June. According to the College, the
extra week's rent will mean that the
students will be able to use their
rooms as storerooms or
accommodation for the three weeks
over Christmas. In the past, say the
residents, they were allowed to keep
their property in their rooms
without the extra week's charge.
One of the petition organisers told
FELIX, 'If we get more than 50%
support from the residents we will
go ahead with providing a standard
letter which residents can submit
with their reduced rent'.

the College on Monday morning

Manager, unveiled his latest holiday
