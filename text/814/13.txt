Yeelen
PG, Renoir, Brunswick Square
Imagine an African legend conjured
up to fill the big screen with
unceasingly stunning pictures, and
here you have it.
Yeelen is a purely African product,
made with a budget large enough to
allow a powerful and professional
production which serves only to
enhance the 'primitive' quality of
what we are seeing.
'Yeelen' means 'the light', and
certainly the most remarkable thing
about the film is its physical beauty;
everywhere the desert glows with
a rich yellow, with bright green trees
for relief from the dried, cracked
mud over which our hero finds
himself wandering. His mother
stands chest-deep in muddy water
filled with green reeds, pouring a
white milk-like liquid over her head,
while summoning up good spirits to
protect her son. And he needs it,
because daddy is coming to kill him.
Father and son are both magic
makers, and the story follows the
young man's travel around Mali
gaining self-knowledge, and hence
power, until he is ready to confront
his father.
The roots of legend are common
throughout the world, and shine
more powerfully in such a basic
environment, where death and
mysticism are both close to the
earth. Life is lived with a much
stronger immediacy here, and
whether you view magic as
symbolic of power of will, or as a
genuine mystic. The startling
images presented in this film will
allow no disbelief or dismissal.
Dream Demon
(Cert 18) Odeon, Leicester Square
A shy and innocent sloany, Diana
Markham (Jemma Redgrave) exists
in a perfect world: wealthy parents,
apartment in London and a
handsome Falklands war hero, her
fiance, waiting in the wings. But
The House on
Carroll Street
Cert PG.
New York, 1951. An attractive
young woman faces a Senate
committee of enquiry—not unlike
the recent experiences of one Oliver
North. She is a woman passionately
concerned with human rights, but
with World War Two hardly over,
she is a woman before her time.
Legends persist in every culture,
because it is through looking at our
roots that we can discover our
common humanity (and animality).
In this film a tribe attempts to slit
our hero's throat until he overcomes
them by force (of magic); then he is
accepted, having proved himself.
There is no room for weakness, and
society seems harsh. Yet once they
have accepted the young man, the
King and his tribe display a loyalty
everything is not perfect for long.
Her sleep is disturbed by savage,
terrifying nightmares. She dreams
of decapitating her fiance at the
alter, of being molested by him...
She is befriended by an American
streetwise punkette, Jenny
(Kathleen Whilhorte), who it seems
used to live in Diana's house. She
Emily Crane, played by Kelly
McGillis {Witness, Top Gun),
intelligent and determined, defies
the enquiry—losing her job and
gaining an entourage of FBI agents
as a result.
Her troubles are compounded
when she befriends a young
German whom she has overheard
in conversation with the enquiry
chairman, Ray Salwen (Mandy
Patinkin—Ragtime, Yentl) in the
mysterious House on Carroll Street.
Further investigations very nearly
towards him which betrays
something deeper than animal
instinct. Our man himself rejects the
King's offer of wealth and worldly
power, to return to the desert.
Do not go to see this film if you
are sensitive or prefer
'sophisticated' acting and character
interplay, it attempts neither. What
it will do is lift you out of your city-
stimulated life, with all its ups and
downs, and capture your mind for
can't remember anything about her
childhood and so has returned to
her roots to find out who she really
is. Meanwhile Diana's dreams turn
horribly real...
And so the scene is set for this
British chiller that tries its best to
imitate Nightmare on Elm Street. A lot
of the film comprises of the two
women running through gloomy,
smoke-filled passages with
anguished looks on their faces, as
Diana wanders from dream to
dream. It seems that a psychic
thread exists between Diana and
Jenny that influences the dreams.
After a while, the dreams affect their
real lives, although just how was
made unclear, under a cloud of
psychology. Indeed, it was often
difficult to fathom out what was real
and what wasn't, or even if there
was a distinction. Towards the end,
Diana shouts (as if to help us out)
'Don't you see? This is real'. I felt
like shouting back 'No, I don't see
at all, actually'.
meet in a sticky end, but she is
saved by FBI agent Cochran, played
by Jeff Daniels (Terms of Endearment,
The Purple Rose of Cairo, Heartburn)
who provides a touch of humour
and the brief romantic interest.
Cochran eventually sides with
Emily in her right to expose
corruption in the highest places
(remember Watergate, Irangate,
etc.?) and to allow good to
conquer.
The House on Carroll Street has a
good basic, if familiar plot, but is let
down by the script which is, in
places, a touch cliched and »t times
drags. However, director Peter
Yates, who has directed such films
as Summer Holiday (yes, the one with
Cliff Richard!) and Steve
McQueen's classic thriller Bullit,
does a good job and just about gets
there.
There are the obligatory twists to
the tale, the hero, the heroine and
the bad guys, but I would question
whether the ten seconds of romance
should allow the film to be billed as
a romantic thriller.
A tense, but predictable
cliffhanger finishes this watchable,
though not outstanding thriller—but
at least it doesn't all end happily
ever after.
Matt Rampton.
105 minutes, leaving many images
lingering for a long time.
Yeelen shows us many common
elements of mankind, in a way that
the vast majority of western movies
fail to do. This, apart from the
stunning photography, is a reason
to see a film with no counterpart in
contemporary cinema.
I think the word is
uncompromising.
Susan Appleby.
Although confusing, the film
holds our attention, if only to figure
out what the hell is going on; and
the climax is suitably arousing with
the mysteries explained by Jenny's
forgotten past.
Comic relief is provided by a pair
of thoroughly despicable local
journalists, played by Jimmy Nail
and Tim Spall (both from Auf
Wiedersehn Pet), who hound the
female pair constantly. I found this
misplaced humour irritating, as it
offset the mood of the film.
The whole film has the look of an
arty film that had to conform to the
formulation of more conventional
American horror flicks, for
commercial purposes. But this film
retains an identity of its own,
although all things considered, it is
still trashy.
I wouldn't recommend paying the
extortionate Odeon Leicester Square
prices to see this, but maybe when
it's out on general release.
