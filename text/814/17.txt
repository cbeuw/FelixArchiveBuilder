PG Tips
Time for a few words to all you
Postgraduates out there from your
man in the Union, the Postgraduate
Affairs Officer, also known as the
PGAO. My name is Dave Clements,
and I'm an Astrophysicist, to be
found at the top of the Physics
department, or on internal phone
number 6681. Quite a few things are
happening in the PG world at IC,
and this occasional column is
intended to keep you all informed.
First the good news, A large
gathering, to which all PGs are
invited, is being planned. Food and
drink (alcoholic or not) will be
provided, and various College and
Union people will be attending. The
idea is to introduce the PGs, so often
left out in the cold, to all these
people, and to allow us to
communicate any problems we
might be having to the men at the
top, so that something can be done
about it. Details of the event will be
arriving through your pigeonholes
soon, and FELIX will be carrying
more about it as well.
Now for something a trifle more
serious. We all know how difficult
it is to find accommodation in
London, but new UK PGs from
outside London have even worse
problems. They get no chance to
stay in an IC run hall or house at all,
and cannot even get booked in to
such a hall over the summer while
they do some flat hunting. I know
of several PGs who have had
problems, and would like to hear
from any others. Foreign students
who have fallen through the net and
have not had places in IC
accommodation I would also like to
hear from. Moves are afoot to do
something about this problem, and
the more information we have about
it the better. Drop me a line in the
Union Office (put a note for the
PGAO c/o IC Union into the internal
mail) and I'll see what I can do. The
same applies, of course, to any other
problems you might have.
