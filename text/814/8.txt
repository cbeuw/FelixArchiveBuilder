IC: a high dropout rate?
by RUPERT CLAYTON
The pages of The Independent have
seen some interesting correspon-
dence over the past two weeks. On
Wednesday October 5 the
newspaper published an article
entitled 'Completion rates vary
widely for degrees'. It revealed that
in all the subject areas in which
Imperial was represented we were
in the bottom three when it came to
the successful completion of
degrees. The statistics, on the
academic years 84/85 to 86/87 were
drawn from a report of the
Committee of Vice-Chancellors and
Principals and the University Grants
Committee. These completion rates
are given below. The article noted
that 'One possible explanation for
the differences (in successful
completion rates) is that some
diversities recruit more able
stui. ^nts who are more likely to
comi 3te courses successfully. But
Impe al College, London, where
success rates are low, has some of
the most highly qualified students.'
On Saturday October 8 The
Independent published a letter from
'Professor John Sherfield, Imperial
College, London'. Professor
Sherfield stated that, 'it is the
business of a college to transform a
student from adolescence to
manhood', and, 'if their idea (the
students) of growing up is to learn
how to wave banners on
demonstrations or take drugs, then
it should come as no shock to learn
that a certain percentage do not
achieve the high standards which
Imperial College demands.'
This was followed on Tuesday
October 11 by a letter from College
Secretary John Smith pointing out
that Saturday's letter was a hoax
and presenting the College's
argument as to why the reported
figures were distorted.
The College's arguement states
that during the period over which
the statistics were compiled, 700
people who were no longer students
were 'dumped' from College
records when College transferred
from manual to computerised
student records. These students
were people who hadjailed some
time ago but were sfflfrecognised as
students although 'not in
attendance'.All of this stemmed,
from their right, under Londonj
University Examination:
their failed examinations (twice if
examinations (twice if necessary).
Records were kept of these
students as it 'avoided the hassle'
of recreating a student's file at the
University and Universities
Statistical Record (USR). Figures
provided by the College and those
from this year's Alternative
Prospectus are reproduced below.
These letters and the original
article raise some questions. Firstly,
the 700 students who were taken
out of the record must be accounted
for somewhere. Where?
The College and the USR compile'
data in two very different forms.
College follow a particular entry of
students through their degrees and;
eighteen months after graduation
compile statistics on success and
failure. Information for the USR is
provided via the University of
London and this method demandsâ€¢
data on those successfully
completing in a particular year in
comparison to all those who left
during that year excluding those
who transferred to other colleges.
The Registrar admits that until
recently the transferral of
information to the USR was carried
out 'as a clerical exercise...not seen
as conveying great benefit to the
College.' Updating student records,
at USR was seen as a lesser priority,:
particularly if it was of no benefit toi
the student concerned.'
The removal of failed students
from the files seems only to have
been undertaken periodically thus
leaving the College's own statistics
as the only reliable indicator of
dropout rates. What is not made
clear is whether the 700 failed
students are included in those
documented in Table 2 or whether
they have been excluded from the
statistics altogether.
Another reasonable question is
why College allowed such patently
false statistics to be included in the
CVCP/UGC Report. Similarly one
would have hoped that The
Independent would have smelt a rat
when they received such a
reactionary letter as 'Professor
Sherfield's'.
The good news is that anyone on
the Materials course can sleep
peacefully at night as there is little
possibility of them failing.
