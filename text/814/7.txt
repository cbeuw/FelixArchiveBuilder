Natural resources
to produce pig-iron, which is worth
far more per ton as an export? With
Brazil's economic problems this is a
good idea, but in the absence of any
suitable coal reserves they need to
use charcoal. The consequence of
this is that outside the perimeter
fence of the World Bank project,
It takes 100 years for
a decent sized tree to
grow
vast areas of forest have already
been felled to produce charcoal to
feed the first three of twenty
planned iron smelters, with many
thousands of acres of forest under
threat. It was production of charcoal
which caused the massive
deforestation of Southern England
and consequent energy crisis in the
16th century; this project is on a
much larger scale.
Hydroelectricity
With the largest river system in the
world, the Amazon basin offers an
ideal opportunity to produce cheap
electricity which would be a great
asset to Brazil's economy. The
theoretical potential of the
Amazon's suitable sites is 130,000
Megawatts, which could be
obtained by flooding 60,000 sq km,
or 1% ot the Amazon Basin,
providing far more energy for many
years than simply burning the wood
contained in this 1%. Some schemes
have been very successful, for
example the Tucuri Dam on a
tributary near the mouth of the
Amazon produces 5,000 MW, more
than Drax in Yorkshire, which is
Europe's largest coal-fired power
station.
A second scheme at Balbina was
built to serve the city of Manaus on
the Amazon. This has been a
complete disaster, economically and
environmentally and has been called
the world's least efficient
The World's least
efficient H.E.P plant
hydroelectric plant. Conceived in
the mid-1970s and responsible for
£770 million of Brazilian foreign
debt, it will not have a single turbine
operating before the end of this
year. It is too shallow, at an average
of eight metres deep which means
that the power generated will be
pitifully small, 109MW, from a lake
which has flooded 1450 sq km of
rainforest (350,000 acres). Most
water is lost by evaporation with the
consequence that the small river
which feeds the lake does not
provide enough water. The scheme
will eventually only produce half as
much power as is required by the
city it was built to serve.
Global Environment
It is the effects on the global
environment that the large scale
burning of forests should be of great
concern to us all. The 1987 burning
of 80,000 square miles of forest
released an estimated 620 million
tonnes of carbon dioxide and
particulate carbon into the
atmosphere. The carbon dioxide is
adding to the gradual build up of
this gas in the atmosphere which
may be leading to a 'greenhouse
effect', particularly as the Amazon
forests play an important part in the
global carbon cycle. The large
quantities of particulate matter are
of similar magnitude to the amounts
given off by giant volcanic
Forests are in danger

completely
erruptions which have had
observable effects on weather
conditions for many months. The
effects of this year's forest burning
season have been observed all over
the South American continent. It is
hard to know how much of current
worries about pollution are real long
term problems and how much is
scaremongering on the part of
environmentalists, but it is clear that
the large scale destruction of forests
•cannot be having a good effect on
the environment.
What can we do?
Not a lot really. Using recycled
paper and not using hardwoods
from the rainforests merely tickle
the surface of the problem. As I said
earlier, if managed properly, forests
should be able to supply our needs
for timber without any problems;
timber production is in any case
negligible compared to projects like
the Gran Carajas charcoal for iron
smelting project. It shouldn't be
forgotten that we are buying the
cheap iron from Brazil.
What is needed is a firm
environmental policy for Brazil and
for the developed nations of the
world to force Brazil to do this. The
Amazon, if properly developed,
could make Brazil one of the richest
nations in the world—current
progress is heading in the direction
of environmental disaster, not only
for Brazil, but possibly the rest of the
world.
Brazil has the biggest problem
because it has the biggest forest, but
there are areas of the world whose
forests are in more immediate
danger. For example central
Forests are in danger
of disappearing
completely
America and parts of the Far East,
where forests are in danger of
disappearing completely due to over
exploitation. Apart from the
problems of flooding and the
Panama Canal, the exhaustion of
these forests will mean an even
bigger strain on the forests of the
Amazon. It is therefore all the more
important that Brazil should learn to
supply these needs without
irreversibly damaging the forests.
Wood is a unique material.
Science
P.S.
Since I wrote this article, new
measures have been announced by
President Sarney of Brazil to protect
the Amazon rainforests, in response
\lndustry replaces forest
to the global outcry at this year's
level of destruction. Amongst these
measures are the restriction of
subsidies for agriculture in the
Amazon region (it was a policy
started in the 1960's whereby
farmers were given land, provided
that they cleared half of it of trees,
that has caused many of today's
problems), a total ban on the export
of logs, and rigorous environmental
controls are to be imposed on all
j agricultural and industrial projects
jin the future. These measures are
obviously a welcome step in the
right direction, but the criticism has
been made that it is merely window
dressing to stay international
pressure. Nothing, for example, has
been said about the Carajas pig iron
smelters, which are likely to destroy
the entire eastern Amazon if no
action is taken now.
