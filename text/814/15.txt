Imperial College 1st XI—2
QMC 1st XI—0
Following the trials last week, this
was the long awaited first game of
the season. Although it was only a
friendly, several 'old hands' knew
they would be fighting for their
places in the face of some new
talent.
The starting line up, however,
was much the same as last year with
Hari Vamadevan, the newly
appointed captain, hoping for a
good start to the season. And, what
a start we had. Only twelve seconds
into the game, after some sterling
work from Max Michaelis, Hari
scored our first goal of the season.
Although, at times, disjointed, the
team in the first half did show some
promise. To this end they managed
to score again before half-time.
However, the second half was
disappointing, with the team
struggling to retain the control it had
displayed in the first half. This could
possibly be attributed to the half-
time substitutes which left several
players out of position.

A storming start to the season was
made by the team with a resounding
4-0 victory against last year's league
champions.
After a tentative start IC took
advantage of the fluctuating
weather conditions on the half hour
when Nigel Collier scored the first
goal from six yards after some good
work from Pip Peel.

Central London Poly—-3
Imperial College—1
The hope and cheerfulness of a new
season quickly evaporated last
Friday as Imperial were taught what
was required in the London second
IC took the 1-0 lead into the
second half and had to soak up
some heavy pressure with
Goldsmith's forcing several
remarkable saves from the
otherwise invisible goalkeeper
Simon Holden. Some stout defence
from Fisher and Dyson kept
Goldsmith's at bay until on the
hour. Phil Ewart scored a fortunate
breakaway goal to take the result to
relative safety.
From then on IC dominated the
match adding two further goals
from a delicate lob from Collier
when Paul Olden put him through,
and a storming volley from the man-
of-the-match Simon Cole.
division into which they were
promoted in May. In a small, dark
court just off Regents Street, IC gave
one of their patchiest performances
in recent years to go down by three
sets to one to an ageing, but well
drilled Central side. To be fair, there
have been some problems for
Imperial this October: the volleyball
posts had been vandalised a month
before, combining with a delay in
repairs to mean that there was no
training with a net until two days
before this fixture.
FOOTBALL
Kings College Hospital III—0
Imperial College VI—2
IC started their season with a well
earned victory against a rather lack
lustre Kings side. IC attacked the
Kings' goal right from the kick off
and were only thwarted by
inadequate finishing and some fine
goalkeeping by the Kings' keeper.
IC looked like going ahead when,
after sustained pressure, a dubious
penalty was awarded for a hand ball
by a Kings' defender, but Hideo
Takano decided to 'back pass' the
ball to the keeper instead of putting
it in the net and that chance went
down the drain. Despite continued
pressure after this anti-climax, the
Kings' defence held out and IC
nearly went behind from a quick
break by Kings culminating in a 20
yard drive acrobatically tipped over
the bar by Simon Turner, who spent
most of the afternoon moaning that
he had nothing to do, and would
rather be anywhere but in goal. IC's
deserved goal came just before half-
time when they latched onto a
through ball from the back to strike
a fine drive past the advancing
Kings' keeper.
