THE -a. . . . ER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION
IC SET TO MERGE WITH RHBNC?
Talks begin on
further mergers
Imperial College and Royal
Holloway and Bedford New College
(RHBNC) in Egham have begun
talks on a possible merger.
Increasing pressures on
accommodation at Imperial coupled
with financial problems at RHBNC
has led to speculation • that the
merger is likely to receive the go
ahead.
A working party has been set up
to examine the feasibility of such a
move. The party is represented at IC
by professor Patrick Dowling, Head
of Civil Engineering and Professor
Roy Anderson, Head of the
Department of Pure and Applied
Biology.
It has been described by the
Rector, Professor Eric Ash, as 'a
small committee with the limited
task of advising either college
whether it is worth the effort to
embark on serious talks'.
Despite the Rector's insistance
that the discussions were of a very
preliminary nature, the working
party has been requested to report
to the Rector of IC and the Principal
of RHBNC by the end of October.
The University Grants Committee
(UGC) have agreed to fund the
merger leading to speculation that
the merger will definately go ahead.
The Rector told FELIX that this
was not the case and said that 'there
must be an overwhelming will for
the merger to take place on both
sides.' He added that the UGC
could not force the institutions to
merge.
A merger with RHBNC would
ease the accommodation problems
at IC by enabling new residences to
be built on land from the RHB&C
site. According to the Rector, first
and second year students would be
based in Egham whilst South
Kensington would be reserved for
third years and Postgraduates.
Government proposals to
introduce Poll Tax will make it
difficult for many students to afford
to live in the centre of London. The
Rector pointed out that, given the
site in Egham, it would be possible
to house students in certain years at
IC, at rents no more than on the
present site.
Professor Ash went on to say
that the move would greatly
strengthen the humanities stream in
IC. He drew comparisons between
IC and the Massachussets Institute
of Technology (MIT) which is strong
on humanities.
The humanities stream at RHBNC
is of a high standard, particularly in
the fields of drama and history.
The standard of the RHBNC
Science departments is greatly
below that of IC, but the Rector is
keen to dispel fears of standards
falling if the merger goes ahead. He
told FELIX that most of the Science
departments would operate with IC
staff and added that as the merger
would be a slow process and that
many RHBNC staff may first
leave.
The fact that the social life of IC
would be greatly disturbed,
particularly with respect to societies
and clubs is not debatable. If
different years in the College were
housed separately in South
Kensington and Egham, the effect
would be dramatic. The Rector
believes it would be 'quite
possible' for people to move
between the sites for the purposes
of social activity—a journey he
estimated at 35 minutes, but which
took 1 hour 10 minutes by sin
at 8.30pm.
RHBNC
tackle
debts
I Royal Holloway and Bedford New
College are investigating proposals
to sell off their land and art
collection in an attempt to solve
their increasing financial problems.
The College is £lm in debt, a
figure which is expected to increase
to £4.5m by 1992. According the
Chairman of RHBNC Council, the
College faces the possibility of
insolvency by 1990.
The College are considering
selling one or two of the pictures in
the Holloway Collection along with
some of the 18 acres of land
belonging to the college.
The land is believed to be valued at
£750,000 to £lm per acre.
Royal Holloway's financial
difficulties result from a combination
of reduced University Grants
Committee (UGC) funding and
unexpected costs which arose from
the merger of Royal Holloway and
New College.
The College has attempted to
reduce its deficit by reducing
staffing levels and expenditure.
The College's princple, M P
Dorothy Wedderburn, has
announced the College's plans to
increase their non-Government
income 'which would bring them
into balance by 1992 or 1993'. The
plan called for £1.5m to set the
scheme up.
RHBNC submitted a case for
special funding during the years
1988 - 1992 to the court of
London University detailing the
plan. In view of problems
experienced by other schools of the
University, the court felt unable to
forward a special case for RHBNC
to the UGC. The Council of the
College forwarded its case directly
to the UGC and was awarded
£350,000 per annum for the next two
years which was significantly less
tha" Collet's requirements
