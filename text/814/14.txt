Misery
Stephen King
Paul wakes up to find himself being
orally raped by Annie. Is he
shocked? Initially, yes, but this
feeling subsides as he realises she is
only engaged in such an act through
her affection for him. Lucky man.
You may think so, but think again.
Why does a car crash in the Rocky
Mountains result in his subjection
to the kiss of life in this manner,
bed-ridden in a perfect stranger's
house?
Well it's like this. Paul Sheldon is
a writer and the stranger, Annie
Wilkes is several things, one of
which is Paul's 'biggest fan'.
Another is a mass murderess, but
we can forgive her for that, it being
an unfortunate but natural side-
effect of being psychotic. Paul is
unwilling to forgive her though and
desperate not to be forced into early
retirement despite already finding
himself in her grisly little scrap
book. Annie doesn't want Paul to
retire either, yet. Oh no, she wants
one more book, exclusively for
herself. Then she'll help him retire
completely.
Paul writes two types of books-
good ones and popular ones. The
popular ones recount heroic tales of
Misery Chastain, a melodramatic
character in an equally
melodramatic nineteenth century
England, and Paul hates them. The
writer plays God in a story, He
giveth and He taketh away, and in
the latest episode, Misery's Child,
Paul hath taken away Misery's life
much to his own amusement.
Much to Annie's anger too. She
wants her heroine back and
proceeds to persuade Paul to
comply. Persuasion comes in many
forms—drugs, an axe, a blowtorch
and not least of all, sheer brute
strength. Annie has them all and
Paul is about to learn what Misery
really means.
Misery is typical Stephen King.
The guts of the book is character
development at a primitive level. To
be precise, the first half is nothing
more. Two characters, one learning
about not just the other but about
himself also. True to form King tells
his quickly captive audience the
whole story immediately. We know
Annie is crazy on page nine and a
psycho soon afterwards, nothing
less than a large female Norman
Bates in fact. Just as Paul cannot
check out of the Wilkes Motel
neither can we opt out of the book.
Hidden in the book is a third
character, King himself, present as
Paul Sheldon's subconscious mind.
The final third or so is largely Paul's
thoughts on writing, life, and life as
a writer, and how he is to escape
Annie's tyranny and continue them.
King reveals what must surely be
his own opinions on those subjects
(Annie excluded). Notably he
discusses 'the gotta' aspect (T gotta
finish this chapter before...') which
separates popular fiction from good
fiction. In drawing attention to this
characteristic of best-sellers it seems
that, to his own mind at least,
Stephen King's twenty or so novels
are undoubtedly popular but almost
certainly not classics.
'Not true say I', but what of
Misery in particular? It develops like
several other King stories and is not
only notably similar to The Shining
but even references the Overlook
Hotel directly. If you know King's
style then the outcome is blindingly
obvious, though that does not forbid
a few surprises along the way.
Certainly not. Making the narrative
predictable in this way destroys
nothing and, in fact, helps to grasp
the reader's attention. You know
Paul eventually escapes but you
want to guess how as early as
possible and then keep reading to
see whether you'd make a good
Holmes or Poirot.
The best King book I've read is
still Salem's Lot, and the newest
release isn't really close, lacking the
considerable depth and tension of
the earlier work, 'it's 'unput-
downable' for sure though, well
endowed with 'gotta' appeal, and
whatever else you may find it
certainly doesn't provide any
misery.
It is available now in hardback and
from December in paperback also.

The Cosmos where did it come from
The Omega
Point
John Gribbin (Corgi £4.95)
Cosmology is in a state of ferment,
which is reflected in John Gribbin's
latest layman's explanation of the
glamourous side of science. The
Omega Point refers to the density of
mass in the universe, omega, which
assumes a value of unity if the
universe is to expand to a steady
state. If omega is greater than this,
the universe will, sooner or later,
collapse to a 'Big Crunch'. This
eventuality, and evidence to
support it, and the consequences
make up the greater part of this
book, which is nevertheless very
readable, as is all of Gribbin's work.
The author has the ability to draw
some quite pleasing analogies to
explain the theories put forward,
although I am left wondering
sometimes if they are all
comprehensible to someone without
a strong physics background.
Having read some of Gribbin's
previous work (ie In Search of
Schrodinger's Cat) seems almost to be
a prerequisite to understanding
some sections which draw on
Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle,
for example. As an explanation of
the 'hairy mathematics' of
cosmology, it does not bear
comparison with the magnificent,
but pricey A Brief History of Time
by Stephen Hawking, but it covers
a lot more ground at a price more
suitable to the man on the Clapham
Omnibus. Overall, I would say that
I enjoyed reading this book, and it
brought a lot of new and very
interesting information to my
attention. The back cover stipulates,
however, that this is "The Ultimate
Book on the Ultimate Topic', which
only warrants a dry cough and a
whisper of 'I beg your pardon?'.

Asterix in
Britain and the
New Adventures
of Mighty Mouse
'What on Earth am I doing
reviewing cartoons?' was the
question I repeatedly asked myself
as I sat through a double bill that no
toddler, let alone College student,
would ordinarily sit through.
Fortunately though, there are
enough insane people out there to
warrant such a review. I wondered
whether this stuff would be a bit too
immature for us sophisticated,
responsible, young adults, but I
guess there isn't anything that
would not appeal to the
undergraduate mentality.
I suppose I was justified in
wanting to see Asterix in Britain,
since I enjoyed the comic book so
much. How would the clever jokes
and wonderful fun-poking at the
British be transferred to screen? The
answer is they don't. Although the
film follows the text of the book very
closely, the pace of narration is so
slow, and the voices incomprehen-
sible, that the end product is just
soporific dross. The animation is
good but the jokes fall flat and the
whole is a rather insipid and tedious
affair (at over 75 mins long).
The New Adventures of Mighty
Mouse is a different matter
altogether I haven't seen the old
adventures but this series of ten
minute cartoons are very fast
moving and quite funny in places.
They certainly woke me up from my
Asterix induced stupor. The style of
animation is refreshingly different
too. I doubt any of you will go out
and get a Mighty Mouse video, but
if you come across it, and need some
cheering up, why not give it a try?
I don't believe I said that!
