THE B R I T I S H INTERNATIONAL
Opening times
The Show is open on Saturday 22nd
to Sunday 30th October, from
9.30am to 7pm each day, except the
final day when it closes at 5pm.
Admission charges
On the first public day (22nd
October) admission costs £10, after
that it is £4.
How to get there
The NEC is situated about ten miles
South East of Birmingham, next to
the M42 motorway, Birmingham
International Station and
Birmingham International Airport.
If going by car you should take the
M l , the M6 and then follow the
police signs. These will direct you
to the NEC or overflow car parks.
Probably the easiest and the
quickest way to the Show is to take
the train from Euston direct to
Birmingham International, which is
connected to the NEC by a short
covered walkway. Combined
travel/admission tickets are available
for all days except October 22nd.
A saver return costs £20, £14.20 if
you have a railcard, and are valid on
any train at weekends, those leaving
London after 09.30 Monday to
Friday. A group discount is
available, whereby one person
travels free for every ten in the
group. A basic admission ticket (£4)
needs to be purchased at the door
by anyone who travels free.
The journey time is about 1 hour
20 minutes and trains depart at the
following times from London
Euston:
Monday-Friday
0710, 0740, 0810, 0835, 0840, 0910,
0935, 1010 and then half hourly.
Saturday
0740, 0835, 0935, 0940, 1010, 1040
and then hourly.
Sunday
0800, 0935, 0940, 1040, 1200 and
then frequently.
Trains return from Birmingham
International at:
Monday-Friday
1228, 1258 then half hourly.
Saturday
1258, 1328, 14 28, 1458, 1558 and
then hourly.
Sunday
1331, 1415, 1431, 1503, 1609, 1630,
1659,1728, 1754, 1758 and then half
hourly.

recommended.

Sunday afternoon at 2.30pm sees
the Grand Final of the Ford
Motorsport Quiz, taking place in the
Ford Dome just outside the main
entrance. There is an Imperial
College connection with this event,
for taking part as the South-East
Area Champions are a team from
City and Guilds College Motor
Club. As a joint venture with Mech.
Eng. Soc, C & G C M C are running a
coach trip to the Motor Show this
Sunday (23rd). Leaving Beit Arch at
) am and returning from the NEC
at 7 pm, this gives plenty of time to
see most of the show and support
the IC students in the final. Cost is
£6 for the coach (with a £ 2 subsidy
for M.E. Soc or M C members), and
£4 admission to the show. This
compares very favourably with the
£ 2 0 British Rail combined
travel/admission tickets. Anyone
interested should come to the
Guilds office this lunchtime.
The British International Motor Show is the industy's
chance to impress the public. FELIX sent Adrian Bourne
along for a preview...
"The World's Greatest Motor Show'
is how the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT)
describe their latest biennial
extravaganza which opens
tomorrow at the National Exhibition
Centre. They may well be right. The
lack of restrictions on the height and
style of stands that is present at
some continental gatherings-means
that this is a truly remarkable show,
even if the Cars that you and I might
be able to soon afford are, for the
most part, rather turgid.
Star of the show without, a doubt
is.the Jaguar XJ220 (Stand 306), a
stunning prototype sports car
design exercise. Powered by a 6.2
litre, 48 valve V12 engine derived
from the World Sportscar
Champion winning XJR9, the car is
designed to accelerate to lOOmph in
eight seconds and go on to a top
speed of over 200mph. The whole
project will now be handed over to
the joint Jaguar/Tom Walkinshaw
Racing Jaguarsport company for
possible production in small
quantities in the early 1990's.
If the Jaguar is ever produced then
it is likely to take the title of the
world's fastest production car,
currently held by the Ferrari F40.
The last new Ferrari built before the
death of company founder Enzo
Ferrari in August, it was produced
in limited numbers as a celebration
of 40 years of car production by the
famous Italian marque. Two
examples of the car are at the show,
on the neighbouring Ferrari and
Pininfarina (the Italian design
studios) stands (304 and 303). The
twin-turbocharged 3 litre engine
pumps out 480 bhp and propels the
car to a maximum 20.1.3mph. To
handle that sort of power requires
a very special chassis,.and the F40
features a steel tube and composite
carbon fibre/Kevlar construction,
similar to that used in Formula One
cars. Full racing seats and harnesses
complete the car's extremely serious
appearance. And the price? Well,
they sold out virtually before it was
announced (Ferrari Grand Prix
driver Gerhard Berger is still waiting
for his), but if you scour the adverts
in Autosport/Autocar + Motor/Car
etc you might find one for a cool half
million or so...
Success in motor sport is an
important theme to many of the
stands, with many manufacturers
showing off their World, European
or British Championship winning
cars. The dominant McClaren-
Honda Grand Prix team have one of
their cars on display on the Honda
Stand (220), where Terry Wogan
will be interviewing World
Championship leader Alain Prost.
World Rally Champions Lancia
(Stand 223) have a Delta Integrate of
champion Miki Biasion, complete
with bodywork damage sustained

on the Safari Rally. Jaguar have the
Le Mans 24hr winning XJR9 and
Motorola (Stand 101) have a
Benetton B188, the class of the 3.5
litre cars in this years GP's.
(Motorola manufacture the car to
pits radio system.) Ford (Stand 102)
also have a Benetton F l car, but this
is one of last year's B187's which
used the V6 turbo engine. Joining
this is the Kaliber Ford Sierra RS500
Cosworth of Andy Rouse, which
won eight rounds of the British
Touring Car Championship, but
due to the scoring system lost the
overall title to the class B BMW M3
of Frank Sytner. No prizes for
guessing what appears on the BMW
stand (221). Peugeot have several of
their 205/405 "Grand Raid" type
rally cars at the show.
There is a fair selection of cars
making their British debuts at the
show, although none of them are
particularly outstanding. The most
publicised launch is that of the new
Vauxhall Cavalier (Stand 310), with
the Ford Sierra its very obvious
target. Personally I prefered the "car
of the future" from the adverts,
which is also on display. Renault
(Stand 317) have their new 19
model, although this will not be
available in Britain until next spring.
They also unveiled the 3.5 litre
atmospheric engine that will power
the Canon-Williams Formula One
car next year. Another 3.5 litre
racing engine was on display at Alfa
Romeo (Stand 401), this time in the
back of a 164 Procar.' This is the new
silhouette formula that motor'sport^s
governing body hopes to introduce
in 1990, although Alfa are the only
manufacturers to show any interest
so far. The car has the same profile
or silhouette as the new 164, but
underneath is a pure racer, clocked
at 210mph on the straight at Monza
recently. The roadgoing 164's are
only a little less impressive,
although one would have thought
that with a car with so much
electronics on board that they would
turn them on. Having a fully
electrically adjustable seat etc is
pretty useless unless the car has the
Ibattery connected. The new Aston
Martin Virage (Stand 323) is a
replacement for the V8, and will
have a similar price tag. The car
looks alright, but the name is awful.
Porsche have one of their 959
supercars on a rotating platform up
in the air on stand 319, presumably
to stop plebs like you and me
touching it or even seeing it in any
great detail. Or perhaps it doesn't
feel quite so super in the prescence
of the Jag...
The two major British car
manufacturers, Ford and Austin
Rover (or the Rover Group, or
whatever they're called this week)
have probably the largest stands at
the show, and probably the most
boring. First prize for bad taste,
however, must go to AR for the
bright yellow Metro with the white
wheel trims. Make sure you visit
stand 207 before you have your
lunch.
A lot of the stands are very
entertaining, and very gimmicky.
The audio-visual technology of the
best is probably more hi-tech than
the East European cars. Mazda
(Stand 108) have a multi screen
display linked to a cutaway four
wheel steering 626 while Fiat (Stand
125) have a Tipo on a giant pogo-
stick. Mercedes persist with their
exploding air-bags and there are
cutaway cars, engines, gearboxes by
the dozen.
As well as cars there are two halls
of commercial vehicles, and three of
accessories, including tools, alarms
and stereos. Worth checking out
here is the Peugeot 309 on the
Pioneer stand (212). Their top of the
range boot-mounted C D
player/amplifier driving a
multispeaker system is very
impressive. The 300W superwoofer
on the back shelf is rather loud...
There is so much on offer at the
show that it would be impossible to
mention it all here. The best advice
I can give to anyone even remotely
interested is to give yourself a day
off work and go along. But be
prepared for thousands of others
doing the same thing.
