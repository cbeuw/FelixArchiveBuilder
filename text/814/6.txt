Forests
under threat
The issue of the destruction of the world's forests has been in the news
a lot recently. Here is a brief attempt to examine the issues and some of
the news stories.
Why does it matter anyway?
There is a growing mass of evidence
to show that trees provide much
more than simply somewhere for
monkeys to swing from and birds to
build nests in; they play an

important part in the environment
and particularly the regulation of
water. For example, forests on high
ground, because of the complex
networks of roots that the trees
have, firstly hold together the soil
and prevent it from being washed
away and secondly trap water
during rainy seasons. Cutting down
the trees therefore has two
immediate consequences: the soil is
washed away and accumulates in
the rivers and the delicate regulation
of the flow of water is upset. In the
rainy season the rivers flood and
during the rest of the year they run
dry. This is no mere conjecture on
the part of environmentalists; the
recent floods in Bangladesh,
although caused by exceptional
rainfall, may have been made worse
by large-scale deforestation in that
part of the world. In Panama, the
very operation of the Panama Canal
is treatened since the canal is above
sea level and requires a constant
input of water. Due to destruction
of about 40% of Panama's forests,
the canal has silted up very badly
and during the dry season there is
a restriction on the size of ships
which can pass through the canal
because of the low water level.
There is a very real danger that by
the time that the Canal Zone passes
back to Panama's control (from the
USA) the canal will be useless, with
serious consequences for Panama's
economy and world shipping.
Problems in Bangladesh and
Panama may be of little concern to
us in other countries, but there is a
further problem which results from
clearing areas of forests. That is, the
atmospheric pollution: carbon
dioxide, carbon monoxide 'and
particulate carbon which are
released when areas of trees are
burnt. This could be the cause of
global problems, as we will see later.
Development of the Amazon
Hardly a week goes by without the
Amazon forests featuring in the
news. Next to the Amazon all other
forests in the world are tiny—it
covers some two million square
miles, which is about twenty times
the size of Great Britain, a size
which is hard to comprehend.
Clearly it is in Brazil's interest to
develop some of the potential of the
region as the country has enormous
social and economic problems.
There are demands for hydroelectric
schemes, agricultural development,
exploitation of the vast mineral
resources in the region and building
of better communications. All too
often however, plans are carried out
without consideration of the long
term environmental consequences.
There is no reason to prevent
development in the region if it can
be carried out with full
consideration of the environment,
as indeed many projects are.
However, it is the few which are not
that pose the biggest threat.
Communications and
Agriculture
Slowly Brazil is improving its
internal communications with
schemes such as the Trans-Amazon
Highway. These communications
provide easy access to what was
previously inaccessible forest. Most
of Brazil's agriculture and industry
is concentrated in the temperate
south of the country in the Rio-Sao
Paolo area where coffee, sugar,
fruit, rubber, etc. are produced,
mainly for export to pay for Brazil's
massive overseas debts. The new
highways allow people to penetrate
deep into the Amazon forests to
start a new life. They start by cutting
down and burning trees in an area

keep livestock, a method of clearing
and preparing land as old as the
South American Indian tribes. The

hand with nearly 5000 daily fires
between July and October, causing
the burning of some 80,000 square
miles of the Amazon forests in 1987
(estimated from weather satellites
by the Sao Paolo Institute for Space
Research). Unfortunately, the land

suggest that it might be—most of the
organic material is in the trees and
plants which are burnt and after
four or five years the land is
practically desert. Once families
have become established in their
new farming lives they have little
option but to move on to another
area of the forest and so the
destruction continues. What is so
unfortunate about all this is that
with a small amount of organisation
and investment, the forests could be
used to much greater economic
benefit, without their destruction
and the creation of vast areas of
desert land. After all, about the most
uneconomic way to use wood is to
burn it; most of the wood is highly
sought after hard wood. If it takes
100 years for a decent-sized
hardwood tree to grow, then cutting
down and replanting every 200th
tree in a year should be no problem.
What the forests cannot recover
from is the large scale clearing of
areas of land. And there may be
plants with medicinal properties yet
to be discovered (Quinine was
discovered in the bark of cinchona
trees in Bolivia in the 19th century,
and at that time was the only cure
for malaria).
Minerals
It is estimated that Brazil has a
quarter of the world's reserves of
iron ore. The richest iron ore
deposits in the world are to be
found at Gran Carajas, deep in the
heart of the Amazon region. A
project funded by the World Bank
aimed at extracting these reserves is
a model of environmental
consideration. A large area of the

forest in the region is protected and
there are controls on replacing forest
which has to be cut down during the
mining. The plan was for Brazil to
export the iron ore, but the powers-
that-be in Brazil came up with a
'better' idea. Why not smelt the ore
