Accommodation Crisis?
Over the past week a few people
have been into my office to
complain about their rents. I can
sympathise with their problem but
the facts surrounding the situation
need to be considered.
Due to the strict financial
regulations imposed upon the
College by the Government, no
public money can be used to
support the residences. This means
that new residences must be paid
for by the students, through ii.eir
hall bills in future years. In 1986 the
residence stock was expanded and
because of this the rents have had
to go up. When Christine Taig was
President she signed an agreement
which limited the rises in rents and,
to date, that agreement has been
honoured.
The question of whether the
charge for the twelfth week is fair,
or not, has also been raised. When
this was raised at the Student
Residence Committee meeting of
the June 8 this year this was seen as
a necessary evil and was passed
with no objections. I am therefore
bound by the Committees decision
to support these extra charges. This
is because last year's President was
one of those who did not object.
Only Union policy can change this.
I am therefore asking people to pay
their full rent charge, because if they
don't, future students will have to
pay more.
Welfare Survey
Next week each of the College's
5,500 students will receive a survey
that is being run by the students'
Union. A lot of time, effort and
money has gone into this survey.
This will all be wasted if you do not
fill it in and return it. Please help us

Timetabling
Do you know that the College has
specific regulations on when
lectures/labs/tutorials can be
timetabled? It appears that some
Departments are unaware of this.
No classes may be timetabled
between the hours of 12.30 and
14.30 on Tuesdays and Thursdays
during the Autumn and Spring
terms, nor may any classes take
place after 12.30 on Wednesdays
throughout the year, according to
College regulations.
So far this term I have uncovered
two instances of courses where
there are several lectures or labs
occurring during the above
mentioned hours, in direct
contravention of College policy.
I heard about these problems
because certain students
approached me concerning them.
They did not wish to approach their
department directly for fear of
academic reprisals. So if you are
faced with a similar problem,
whatever your department, please
come and speak to me in confidence
about the matter, so that I can take
it up with the relevant people.
Sports Shop Sale
As a result of the move by STA into
the old Sports Shop, the shop has
been relocated to the Jazz Room in
the Union Building (just up the
stairs from the Union Office), and
will open from 11am to 2pm
Monday to Friday. We have a large
amount of stock which needs to be
cleared. To this effect, the Union
will be holding a sale of regalia,
sports clothing and accessories in the
JCR on Wednesday 2nd and
Thursday 3rd November. More
details nearer the date. To all club
captains and chairmen: If there are
any of you who have regalia in the
sports shop, please can you see me
as soon as possible.
Room Bookings
When clubs book rooms within the
Union building or the JCR, it is then-
responsibility to ensure that the
room is clean after use. If rooms are
found to be untidy or need further
cleaning then the additional costs
will be deducted from the room
deposit, and all future bookings will
automatically be referred to the
Exec. This may mean a delay of up
to 2 weeks before subsequent
bookings are confirmed. You have
been warned!
Charles Brereton.
to help you by completing your
form, it will take half an hour at
most, as honestly as possible by
Friday November 4. There is no way
results can be traced back to you so
all the answers are totally
anonymous.
Welfare '89 is the most ambitious
welfare project ever to be attempted
at this College. Its aim is to obtain
a databank of information about
you, the students of IC. This will
then be used to show which areas
need to be addressed in each of four
week-long campaigns to be run
throughout the year, Towards the
end of the year the success of these
campaigns will be measured.
Initial survey
Next week all the 5,000 students of
the College will receive a survey
questionnaire via their departmental
pigeonholes. This questionnaire is
not small and it will take time to fill
in, I do not apologise for this. If we
are to identify the needs of our
students this must, be done
thoroughly and this survey is
nothing if not thorough. When you
receive your questionnaire you will
see that a large section of it asks
some very personal questions.
Please answer these as honestly as
possible since there is absolutely no
way the answers can be traced back
to the individual. Once your form
has been returned to the box with
your departmental messengers it
becomes just one of up to 5,000
returned forms.
In the past these surveys have
failed because people were not
prepared to do the analysis to obtain
the results. This year I have
arranged for a market research
company, to do this analysis. All we
need to do is 'idiot-read' the forms,
jthat is go through them to make
sure they make sense. We will need
help to do this so if you want to be
involved please contact me via the
Union Office.
Campaigns
The information from these surveys
will dictate the direction the
campaigns will take. Some people
have asked whether we need to
educate our students at all. I will
answer this by quoting the results
of a recent straw poll of 100 of IC's
students. 65 of the sample believed
that you could get AIDS from giving
blood. If you are someone who
believes that this is true, then you
need educating. If you are one of the
'educated' 35 per cent, don't get
blase, I'm sure that there is some
misconception you hold that needs
changing.
The campaigns are not aimed to
preach at people, they are to
increase awareness. I will be
working closely with the local health
education authority and so the
media used will be interesting and
varied. Some events already
planned are; an IC AIDS day with
doctors, drug companies and the
Terrence Higgins Trust; a non-
alcoholic bar promotion and a 'uses
and abuses' quiz night.
Follow-up survey
In the Summer Term there is to be
a follow-up survey to see if we have
changed any attitudes. This will be
much smaller than the first survey
but more of that nearer the time.
I hope you will realise the
importance of Welfare '89 and will
give it your full support from the
start by filling in your questionnaire
and returning it by Friday October 4.

Uncle Ian
First, the what's on bit:
Tomorrow night sees the Annual
Steer-Rides Conference in the Union
Bar with suitably awesome country
& western music.
On Wednesday there will be the
second of our regular discos with a
happy hour between 7-8pm.
As a result of enquiries about the
video screen that was hired for
Freshers' Week, the Union has
decided to buy a 50" system for
internal use. This will be made
available to clubs etc on a hire basis
in order that repayment to the
Union Finance Committee can be
effected as quickly as possible.
There are still certain aspects
regarding security, hire charge, etc
to be decided but please get in
contact with me if you are interested
in using the system.
I've notad that there have been a
number of boat cruises recently and
I think frtat a good discount could
be achieved if they were booked
centrally through the Union,
particularly considering the high
level of involvement of one cruise
firm in other areas of the Union's
activities. So if anyone requires a
boat, come and have a word with
Uncle Ian first.
