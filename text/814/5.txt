The Independent
Traveller
In recent years travel has become accessible to most students, whether
it is a month's interrailing around Europe or a World tour. This has come
about by a unique combination of freely available discount flights, the
strength of Western currencies against those of Third World countries and
the opening up of many countries after years of isolation. One may
question the state of a world economy that allows a priveleged few
opportunities that many can only dream of. But travellers can make a
positive contribution to the countries they visit, not only by spending
foreign currency but by increasing awareness of the unique culture they
possess.

The early pioneers of independent
travel, a few hardy Ausies who
overlanded from Sydney to
London, laid the trail for increasing
numbers of backpacking travellers,
intent on exploring the most remote
regions of the world. Although the
wars in Iran and Afghanistan have
limited the classic Asian overland
trip, travellers are now regularly
visiting six continents, and even
Antarctica is beginning to be opened
up by tourist flights from Argentina.
As the destinations explored
expands, an increasing number of
guide books aimed at the
independent traveller have
appeared, so if one is planning a
trip, a reasonable body of experience
has already accumulated on most
countries.
With the increasing numbers of
backpackers travelling to remote
destinations, an entire subculture
has developed. One can sit in cafes
with names like 'Jim's Peace Cafe'
or 'The Hard Rock Cafe' and munch
meusli or banana pancakes all over
South East Asia and even China.
And as you consume you decadent
Western luxuries, you can listen to
your fellow travellers boast of their
exploits. For some, travelling has
become a competition to see as
much as possible, as cheaply and as
quickly as their bodies can stand,
while others, the discovery of
'genuine' experiences are the
subject of their boasts. For most
mere mortals, travelling at one's
own pace and gaining an insight
into the country they are visiting is
enough, after all, you are on
holiday!
problem, my advice is carry it in a
money belt no matter how safe the
country you are in is. Eurocheques
are useful in Europe where massive
commissions are charged on
travellers cheques, whereas in the
Third World, where commission is
rarely charged, American Express
Travellers Cheques are the most
widely accepted. A few American
dollars in cash can also be extremely
useful in difficult situations, but in
some countries using foreign
currency is illegal, so be careful.
Insurance
Highly recommended because
people can get very ill out in the
Third World, and if you are not
insured, you can just be left to rot.
Both ISIS and Travel Cuts on Regent
Street do good deals, but the cost of
insurance seems to have risen
phenominally in recent years.
experience of bucket shops has been
favourable, but stories do circulate
of small operations folding after
payment of the fare, but before
tickets are received. These shops
will advertise their flights in
magazines like L A M and TNT.
Cards
As a student there are many cards
that can be purchased that will save
you money. The ISIC (International
Student Identity Card) is generally
accepted throughout the world,
although in some countries like
China, student identity is useless for
getting discounts. The Y H A is also
useful, because in many parts of the
world, Youth Hostels represent the
icheapest accommodation available.
Money
Carrying money is always a
Health
Health is a subject often ignored by
travellers, but it is sickness that is
likely to ruin your holiday. Public
health in the Third World comes
nowhere near the standards we
expect in the West, and the traveller
can become prey to many diseases
just due to poorly prepared food or
contaminated water. Always consult
your doctor before you leave about
what injections you should have,
and it is probably a good idea to
have an injection against Hepatitis
A if you are going anywhere in the
Third World. Personal hygiene is
important and water should never
be drunk from the tap, although
even bottled water can be suspect
because some racketeers fill empty
bottles with tap water, reseal it and
then resell it. To be safe, drink only
boiled or sterilised water (although
there are side-effects from drinking
sterilised water long term), or Coca
Cola, which is available
internationally. Food is more of a
problem, because food can be
prepared at the beginning of the day
and kept warm with flies walking all
over it. It is best to just eat food that
is cooked quickly at a high
temperature, preferably in front of
you, but this can be difficult in many
countries. Basically, everything
must be suspected as a source of
infection, you can't just pick up food
off street sellers and expect it to be
alright.
| Over the next few weeks, we are
planning to begin a regular travel
column in FELIX, including features
on particular countries or regions,
hints on how to organise your
holiday, reviews of guidebooks and
tips and rumours as we hear them.
Features or information on any
aspect of travel are welcome. Feel
free to write about Bognor or remote
monastries in Tibet. Any interesting
photos you have would also be of
interest.
Where to go
Obviously a question of prime
importance, and one which the
features in subsequent issues will
help you with. Once you have
decided your destination, purchase
a good guide book. The books
available for a particular destination
vary enormously, so the best idea is
brouse the shelves of a good
bookshop. One highly
recommended shop is The Travel
Bookshop, 13 Blenheim Crescent,
W l l , just off the Portobello Road.
There are also two publishing
companies, Lonely Planet and the
Rough Guides, that specialise in
guides for the independent
traveller. In my opinion, the Lonely
Planet guides are usually the best,
although they do not cover Europe,
Russia or the USA and one must
remember that any guide will never
be 100 per cent accurate.
Transport
Getting to and from your
destination will always represent a
large proportion of any budget. In
Europe, the interrail ticket still
represents great value for money,
although ? cheap package flight may
work out cheaper if you are touring
one country. Outside Europe, flying
is by far the best way unless you are
planning a long overland trip.
Cheap flights are easy to come by
in London, whether from STA,
Trailfinders or a bucket shop. Bucket
shops will usually sell the cheapest
tickets, but these may involve
lengthy stopovers and rather
indirect routes, like via Moscow or
flying to China via Los Angles. My
