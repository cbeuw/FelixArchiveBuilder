SO YOU W A N T TO SEE A P L A Y
There are a great many
theatres in London, in fact
about 50 or so, ranging
from the vast and vastly
commercial Drury Lane
Theatre (which will soon
be mounting a musical,
Gable-less 'Gone With The
Wind' for a cool £150,000),
through the diminutive Am-
bassadors with the ever-
lasting "Mousetrap", to
the non-profit making
(well, they say they plan-
ned it that way) "Almost
Free Theatre". You pays
your money and you takes
your choice. But, I hear
you at the back cry, what
money? Grant? A good tic-
ket for a West End play
will cost about £1.50 or so,
but there are places which
are Arts Council or other-
wise subsidized and are
thus cheaper. It is there-
fore the solemn duty of this
article to give an impres-
sion of what is available at
student rates and what (in
my view) is worthwhile
that is not. The list is by
no means comprehensive
and is rather subjective.
Tough. Blame Sugden.
Shaw Theatre
ftwixt Euston and St. Pan-
eras).
Michael Croft, founder
of the splendid "National
Youth Theatre", set up the
professional Dolphin Com-
pany at the Shaw, largely
with the help of Camden
Council. The aim is "To
provide good Theatre at
prices young people can
afford"; so, on production
of a Student Card, you zan
get a pretty good seat for
25p. The productions are
generally straightforward
and textual, especially the
Shakespeare, and this will
certainly be true of the
forthcoming "Romeo and
Juliet" (of which t h e
Young Vic managed to
make such a mess). The
set-up is remarkably plush,
with a nicely modern aud-
itorium and about the long-
est Theatre bar in London.
Friendly folks, but be care-
ful about opening the 'en-
velope' programmes. They
spill everywhere.
Young Vic
(near Old Vic, Waterloo).
Michael Croft was con-
sistently refused Arts
Council money to set up
the Dolphin Company, but
Olivier's sidekick Frank
hand-in-yer-pocket Dunlop
got a brand new Theatre,
plus working capital with-
out having to ask twice.
All tickets are 40p, for
which the director demon-
strates how much clev-
erer he is than the play-
wright, especially Shakes-
peare. But don't let me put
you off. Book next door at
the National's office.
Almost Free
Theatre
(Rupert Street, near Pica-
dilly Circus).
Ed Berman, or Professor
R. L. Dogg (Dogg R. L —
get it?) of Inter-Action
Productions runs this curi-
ous centre for three fringe
companies (including his
own "Dogg's Troupe")
providing theatre at any
price you want to pay for
a ticket. As well as even-
ing performances there are
lunch-time performances
starting at 1.15 p.m., fin-
ishing about 2 p.m. Despite
their seemingly suicidal
financial policy the place
exudes an air of artistic
endeavour — whether this
will survive when the nov-
elty wears off is open to
speculation. Don't expect
ice-cream in the interval,
but just mutter about Pin-
ter, Surrealism, how well
lonesco did this, and how
important it all is, and you
should pass off as trendy.
Royal Court
(Sloane Square).
The Court is the only
Theatre in U.S.K., and is,
as the home of the Eng-
lish Stage Company, Arts
Council subsidized. Any
tickets unsold by 5 min-
utes before the perform-
ance are sold to students
for 25 pence. There has
been a good run of
plays from here re-
cently — "The Philanthro-
pist", "The Contractor",
"Home" (recently televi-
sed), "The Changing
Room" and "West of
Suez" have all attained
West End transfers. Small
(440 seats) and pleasant.
The Theatre Upstairs is
the Court's experimental
wing, and as such produ-
ces anything sufficiently
novel to attract critical at-
tention.
National Theatre
at the Old Vic
(Waterloo).
The Larry Olivier Mob. It
is critically fashionable to
slate the National at the
moment, but they are not
at all bad and the sickly-
comic "The National
Health" is well worth see-
ing. No cheap student sa-
tes I'm afraid, but the gal-
lery is great fun (seated
15p, or standing 10p). Pro-
grammes are rather expen-
sive, though you do get a
cast list free, and bars are
plentiful. So are Student
Nurses in the gallery.
Royal
Shakespeare
Company
at the Aldwych
World-wide, probably
the best English-speaking
Company just now, but
Old Bill would not recog-
nise much of the mater-
ial in current reper-
toire here—only one of the
plays is his, and that (Mid-
summer Night's Dream) is
a Peter Brook directorial
rehash. Like the National,
this gang are getting a
brand-new multi-million
pound Theatre in the near
future, so they are worth
seeing just for the sake of
keeping an eye on your
investment. However, once
again, like the National
there are no Student Re
ductions as such, but re-
ductions and other bene-
fits can be obtained by
joining the R.S.C. Club.
The National also has one.
Economists can have fun
working out how many tic-
kets must be bought to
break-even on the mem-
bership fee. No cheap gal-
lery tickets.
Theatre Clubs
The Theatre Clubs have
largely faded out of impor-
tance now that there is no
Lord Chamberlain to stop
actors taking their clothes
off and saying nasty
words. However, the
Hampstead Theatre Club
(Swiss Cottage) produces
some good stuff as a sort
of London Off-Broadway,
and Theatre 84 (Margaret
Street) as a sort of Off-
Off-Broadway.

Mermaid
(next to Blackfriars Tube)
There is a unique aura
about this reconstructed
riverside warehouse, with
its open stage and simple
raked auditorium, rugged
and evocative without be-
ing uncomfortable, tucked
away below Blackfriars
Bridge in the nightly des-
erted City. The plays are
general unusual (Albert
Camus at the moment) —
but good. No reductions,
but the atmosphere makes
up for that. My favourite
Theatre.
Roundhouse
(Chalk Farm Tube)
Like the Mermaid's
warehouse, this building
was not originally a The-
atre but an engine shed,
making the new National
and R.S.C. palaces look
rather whitely elephantine.
Old timber and wrought
iron arches give character
to this temple of the vagu-
ely avant-garde, for Tyn-
an's " O h ! Calcutta!", War-
hol's "Pork", Othello's
"Catch My Soul" and
Tebelak's "Godspell" all
started London life here.
A sort of young Mermaid.
There is a good fish and
chip shop across the road.
The acting schools
R.A.D.A. and L.A.M.D.A. al-
so have clubs for their stu-
dent productions. I think.
Others
The "Open Air Theatre"
in Regent's Park is magical
on a summer's evening —
just ignore the Boeings —
and it Is not to be con-
fused with Mankowitz's
Open Space (Tottenham
Court Road), desperately
avant-garde, sweetie. The
G r e e n w i c h Theatre
(Greenwich Park) is chea-
per than the West End, but
less accessible. The newly
rebuilt Westminster Thea-
tre (near Victoria) is run
by M.K.A. (Moral Re-Arm-
ament) and tends to give
away tickets to students if
approached.
Dress & fings
Nobody seems to dress
for the Tneatre nowadays,
onstage or off. " O h ! Cal-
cutta!'' calls for a clean
overcoat or Mac, but that's
aoout it, apart from an ob-
ligatory appearance of
destitution for Fringe
Theatre. Information for
West End appears in the
quality dailies, "Time Out"
and "What's O n ? " carrying
the rest. Tickets by 'phone
(collect 30 minutes Defore
performances), or from
Theatre Box Office (don't
expect politeness, they re
all failed actors), or Keith
Prowse.
Really cheap
Theatre
Get to know some Lon-
don stagehands (any pub
near a Theatre, but the
Playbill bar, St. Alban's
Street is best) and they'll
get you 'papers' (useful
jargon to drop). Or join
NATKE (National Associa-
tion of Theatre and Kin-
ema Employees). Or re-
view plays for Felix.
McLOOGE SPEAKS
One of the very benefi-
cial side-effects of the Au-
tonomy Campaign has
been the basis of this
Campaign on area organ-
isations (like U.S.K.) with
such features as area mar-
ches, area fund raising
events and area General
meetings. The develop-
ment of areas is the stu-
dent body's way of fighting
the Binary System, that
regulation educational di-
vision whereby you go to a
plush University with good
Residence Halls, sports
facilities and Union facil-
ities, whilst some of your
old school pals go to the
poorer relations of higher
education — polytechnics,
Colleges of Education,
Technical colleges, etc. —
with their often dreadful
lack of residential, sport-
ing, union facilities. And
this material division is
only reflective of the much
more potent education div-
ision whereby all the best
6th formers are supposed
to go to University, whilst
the "not-so-bright lads and
lasses" go to Polys., Colls,
of Ed. etc. Whilst the battle
against the binary system
within school education
(i.e. Comprehensive v
Grammar Schools) is
slowly making advances,
no such advances have
been made within the
realms of Higher Educa-
tion why can't we have
Comprehensive Universit-
ies, where education stu-
dents work alongside
science students, art stu-
dents, engineering stu-
dents, etc.?
In supporting the N.U.S.
and all the teaching Un-
ions who have come out
solidly against the James
Report, we are fighting the
battle, for equality in
Higher Education equality
in society and for justice.
LONG LIVE U.S.K.!
