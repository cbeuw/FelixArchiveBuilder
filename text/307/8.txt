America's first ever gig
was, I believe at I.C. about
18 months ago, for which
they were paid £25.
Their p r i c e is n o w
£750, a testimony in-
deed to a rapid rise to a
fame based on music
which is and let's be honest
frank, cruel and boring,
that of Crosby, Stills, Nash
nothing very different from
and Young or many other
acoustic - guitar based
groups. Having become
Underground favourites
through being adopted by
Underground Cult Figure
Jeff Dexter and frequently
playing Implosion they re-
leased a fairly successful
album followed by a very
successful single whose
tune is predictable and
whose lyrics are, shall we
say, nice-but-unimportant.
But, as I said, America
are now a very successful
group and promoters who
(like your own Entertain-
ments Committee, readers)
were foresighted enough to
book them when their price
was a good* deal less than
it is now are very success-
ful too. The Great Hall
was bursting at the seams
for the concert and some
people still had to be turned
away. The musical evening
was opened by Philip
Goodhand-Tait whose set
was well, if not ecstatically
received by a very recep-
tive and sympathetic audi-
ence. Although to many
people he may be just a
double - barrelled name
whom Ents book quite of-
ten, he is a successful
songwriter, having written
"One Road" for the Love
Affair, "The song that
brings out peoples preju-
dices" as he put it. His
set included, among other
self-penned numbers.
Buddy Holly's "Every Day"
and I enjoyed it a lot more
than his attempt at the Ly-
ceum last term with Wish-
bone Ash. This may have
been because your review-
er was able to secure a real
comfortable seat instead of
having to squat on the floor.
It was interesting to note
that the most popular num-
bers of both Goodhand-
Tait's and Linda Lewis' act
were 12-bar blues sequen-
ces. C'est la vie. Miss
m m

Lewis, the coloured folk
singer from dahn the East
End sang a selection of
songs about certain men
and certain parts of Lon-
don; the songs were inter-
esting, and again, and
again she was well re-
ceived. All the artists must
have sensed the "good
vibes, man" in the air and
talked to the crowd to long
lost brothers. America took
the stage to thunderous ap-
plause normally reserved
for heavy groups after a
wait which at an outdoor
festival would have been
termed" agonizing" How-
ever it was pretty warm in
the Great Hall. They ran
through their usual repter-
toire of songs whose titles
for the most part elude me,
but which did include
"Horse with No Name,"
"California" and "The
Sandman" a great song
with an original melody and
with lyrics which carry a
sense of foreboding. Per-
haps it's this song people
are buying the single for,
but somehow I doubt it.
The only other song whose
lyrics grabbed one was
Arlo Guthries "Coming into
Los Angeles." Anyway the
audience enjoyed it and
who am l to criticise what
people enjoy. I think I'll
resign. "Lots of significant
points at this concert folks
and another one was the
behaviour of the audience.
They remained transfixed
with attention throughout
the act and there was not
one out-freaker (or freaker-
out) even during the en-
core, so the group must
have been good and I'm
wrong. Goodnight.

S t o n e
C r o w s
I should like everybody
to know about a group
called Man. Not a new
group by any means, in fact
their fourth album has just
been released, but a group
that is only just beginning
to get recognition in this
country. On the continent
they are a top band so I
doubt the fact that they go
out for 50 quid a night wor-
ries them unduly. But
things are, as I said, look-
ing up, and they must have
been delighted with their
reception in the Great Hall
on Saturday. The line-up
(two guitars, drums, bass)
is nothing to raise the eye-
brows, but the standard of
playing, and the empathy
which exists between the
players and the subtle use
of dynamics prompt me to
stick my neck out and say
that in a years time they
will be as big as Yes. The
group played three num-
bers, including their best-
known (a relative term)
song "Daughter of the
Fireplace," all of them very
long, but the shifts of tex-
ture ensured that they never
became boring. All this,
too, without organist Clive
John who has just left.
When he is replaced and
the full scope of the band
is realised Man will be
wowing audiences up and
down the country.
I thought I had better say
this (I did mean it) so that
Man were not completely
overshadowed by Stone the
Crows who were easily the
best group to have played
at I.C. this year (academic
year you fool). And to
think I thought they were
just a rock band with a
chick singer. They played
music ranging from that
like Soft Machine in "the
good old days" (keyboard
player Ronnie Leahy's in-
fluence I think) to down-
home country blues and
sounded as if they had
been playing them all for
years (probably have). For
me the highlight of the
evening was the keyboards
solo; guitarist Les Harvey's
solo was just a bit boring—
he seems to have just dis-
covered echo and demon-
strated it at length, wow far
out man but hasn't it all
been done before? But I
dont want to get too criti-
cal and no doubt the audi-
ence loved it. To the disap-
pointmentjof many Maggie
Bell didn't bust the only
button on her jacket, but
of course it was music that
mattered and Crows deliv-
ered the goods. It was a
measure of their popularity
that songs like " B i g Jim
Salter" and "Mister Wiz-
ard" were enthusiastically
applauded when intro-
duced. Last term I said that
Stone the Crows were go-
ing places. It seems they
have arrived.
The C.W. Post choir, pictured above, gave a concert in the Great Hall last week.
Whilst the choir gave a first class performance they must surely have been insulted
by the pathetic turn out. In fact a mere forty people turned up, included in which we
have the entire rag committee and the tea makers. Twenty people were needed to pay
to break even. They didn't.
