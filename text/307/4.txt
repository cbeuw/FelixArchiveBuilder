L E N T E M
The glamour that one
initially attaches to a new
job, a new home, a new
woman, or even just a new
feeling is so seldom real-
ised, it was therefore with
great surprise that, within
a month of joining the
helix staff I received an
oner of a free reporting
trip. Much more surprising
was the fact that this was
a three-day trip . . . to
Paris!
All this, long since past,
happened at tne beginning
o* last term. Hoverlloyd,
the private company pro-
viding a Gross-Channel
hovercraft service had
written making the offer.
To gain publicity, they
chose to invite (from all
the London colleges) a
Felix reporter for the ride.
The itinerary was ex-
plained simply as three
days in Paris, travelling
there on the first day and
back again on the last. We
were to travel by a
sandwich combination of
C o a c h - H o v e r c r a f t -
Coach. Little more was
said until the departure
day gradually drew closer.
I went to the bank and
withdrew my life savings
so that I could at least
take advantage of the duty
free opportunity that return
would offer and then
waited.
On a typically cold Dec-
ember morning I got up at
the unusually early hour of
7.00 a.m., four hours sleep
behind me, and packed,
ate and made my way to
Victoria Coach Station.
The Coach Station was
empty, almost ghostly I
thought when I arrived, but
the coach was there. The
engine was running, warm-
ing the coach for the com-
ing run to Ramsgate. A
charming chatty bird ar-
rived a bit later. That
cheered me. Another one,
younger but almost as
charming arrived after (I
prefer 'em experienced)
and we set off. Not quite
as simple a journey as I
wouid nave liked, because
it transpired that tnere
were some other men com-
ing too. hours after we
got to Ramsgate—hell, is
tne M2 boring!
Ramsgate Hoverterminal
is like a mini-airport—
a Hoverport they call it.
Environmentalists may re-
memoer the prooiems
hoverlloyd had in persuad-
ing Pegweil Bay locais that
what tney had aiways wan-
ted was a hoverport in
their front gardens. Hover-
lloyd won and a local who
was with us tried to assure
me that the peasants
were now convinced. I
mignt have been, had not
this particular person
spent the whole summer
working for the very
people organising the trip!
In fairness the Hoverport
does not look too out of
piace, and considering it
cost £1.5 million to build,
it's not badly finished
either.
We saw a Hovercraft
from the terminal. A big
thing, its large snout open,
ready to swallow the first
35 cars that might come its
way. Like Seaspeed (BR's
service) Hoverlloyd oper-
ate B H C SR.N4's, now re-
ferred to as the Mountbat-
ten Class. These things are
certainly impressive, cap-
able of carrying up to 60
ton disposable loads at
speeds of over 50 knots.
After a while we board-
ed, the local rag's photo-
grapher took our photo
(never happened to me
before!) and the craft
rose, gently cresting the
waves and speeding into
the Channel — soon to
cross those notorious
Goodwins. The hostesses
came round after a while
offering t h e i r wares
(drinks, etc.), (One word
about the hostesses—they
are not up to airline stand-
ards, at least in looks,
most look like 30-40 year
old housewives).
People's reactions by
this stage are variable,
some go very white. I
found the sensation of tra-
velling in big hovercraft
exhilarating. Previously in
the year I had crossed the
Soient in a Seaspeed
side-wall craft, but this
was really something com-
pletely different. After a
while we were invited up-
top. (I forget whether it
was the bridge or the
cockpit). The pilot (1 re-
memoer that bit) perched
upon a high seat had a
vastly superior view than
the passengers below him.
A whole array of instrum-
ents before him, his lot is
very similar to that of an
airline pilot. Gradually
they showed us almost
everything about the craft
(except a look under the
skirt). Very safe I thought!
I might say that I have
since met someone they
nearly mowed down mid-
channel.
The French terminal was
less impressive. Smaller,
yet with much more offic-
ious staff — altogether
French. (Don't be sur-
prised if I say I really like
them). There is, however,
a plaque to somebody or
other—a load of cock.
The worst part was to
come and I think I should
say, by choice, I would not
travel from London to
Paris by Hovercraft. Four
hours in a comfortable
French coach wouldn't be
too bad if it were com-
fortable, if it had been
warmer, and if the driver
hadn't chosen to stop in
the middle of nowhere
with little to see except
row upon row of British
WW1 war graves; what a
lovely war.
INTERNATIONAL FRUSTRATION"
L o r d C a r a d o n a t I . C .
Many problems exist at the
United Nations; it should be re
named "International Frustra-
tion", said Lord Caradon whilst
speaking at I.C. by invitation ot
Third World First—U.N.S.A.
Although he spoke only of
immediate conflicts, he stated
that the more important issues
such as Race, Poverty and
Population should not be over-
looked.
A major problem at the U.N.,
he continued, was that its
members tried to assert their
nationalist policies at an inter-
national level. He had little
sympathy for people who critic-
ised the United Nations for
failure to solve problems. The
agreement made in San Fran-
cisco resulting in the founda-
tion of the United Nations is
still as valid and correct now
as it was then. People tend to
think of the U.N. as a large
impersonal organisation which
can solve any problems. Un-
fortunately, they always come
too late with their problems
when they have succeeded in
making a mess of them. How-
ever, by condemning the U.N'.,
they are only condemning
themselves and their own failure
to reach a reasonable conclu-
sion.
He also warned of the "com-
placency" of the predominantly
white minority that controls
most of the world's wealth
whilst largely ignoring the pre-
sence of the coloured majority
of the world's population that"
is suffering from poverty, over-
population and illiteracy. This
problem, he believes, is one of
the greatest that has ever faced
mankind.
Lord Caradon went on to ex-
plain the function and useful-
ness ot the U.N. First its use as
an "International Forum" where
all nations' views can be heard.
By way of illustration he re-
called that four years ago, Malta
had called for a resolution de-
claring sea-bed mineral re-
sources the property of all
mankind. This resolution gained
support and was finally accept-
ed unanimously, clearly demon-
strating how a small country
can contribute to important
international policies.
His second point was that
the U.N. provides a unique situ-
ation for good contact between
high-ranking officials of most
countries and the eventual
understanding of most prob-
lems. He gave vivid details of
how he walked back and forth
down 3rd Avenue in New York
trying to settle Arab and Israeli
problems and how with his per-
sonal understanding with a Rus-
sian representative, the Soviet
Union did not veto a proposi-
tion for its own sake. Whereas
in the good old days, a diplo-
mat was forced to travel from
country to country, he can now
do most of his business at the
U.N. This has led to "A New
Parliamentary World Diplom-
acy" with a public declaration
of the results obtained. In other
words, a problem has to be
solved, or failure admitted. He
pointed out that the Paris
Peace Talks between North and
South Vietnam, the Vietcong
and the U.S.A. have and prob-
ably will fail to reach a conclu-
sion for this reason.
Finally, he spoke of the abil-
ity of the U.N. to act as a
"Machine for International De-
velopment", to alleviate poverty
by population and other con-
trols. He quoted the case of
Jamaica, which received a large
inflow of cash after the discov-
ery of bauxite. Whilst schools
and hospitals were being built,
the population (which nobody
was concerned about) was ris-
ing so rapidly as a result, that
after ten years, the people were
worse off. Other countries have
population problems, e.g. India,
where it is increasing at 1
million a month, clearly this
problem must be solved before
any raising in the standard of
living can occur.
Race, poverty and population
are the international problems
of the future, but certain politi-
cal problems still exist. For ex-
ample, the Conference on the
Environment in Stockholm is
imperilled by the political con-
siderations of E. Germany.
Lord Caradon continually
emphasised the policy of suc-
cess on the international scene
that is required, rather than vic-
tory on the nationalist scale. He
answered several questions and
emphasised this in his replies.
On being questioned on North-
ern Ireland, he replied that ne
was not familiar with the situa-
tion there which was the reason
for his inclusion in the recent
B.B.C. investigation.
Altogether, he is to be con-
gratulated on a fine delivery, a
very amusing, eloquent and
agreeable talk.
McLooge Expands
Paris had changed little
since I had last visited her.
There's little to tell those
who have been and for
those who haven't, well
you should.
We were wined and
dined both nights by our
hosts. The food was good,
the wine was ordinaire,
and the meal took a long
time to eat. My Whole day
in Paris was spent ohrissy
shopping, etc., having
been unable to rise before
12.00 noon due to the
effects of the meal (etc.)
the night before.
Return was the same as
going. Even to the names
on those crosses (you
would not forget them
either if you saw them). A
companion joined our fold
for the return. She was
called Irene, was attrac-
tive, talked knowiedgeably
and enjoyed the ride. I
mention this because she
was probably the fairest
test. She had wanted to
travel the cheapest way
and time was immaterial.
Duty free laden, and
very tired, I returned to
Linstead about 50 hours
after I left. I had spent 15
travelling and about 8
sleeping and I had enjoyed
it.
We're now getting well into
the second term and the Union
Autonomy issue is still tending
to dwarf some other issues, in-
cluding:—
DIVERSIFICATION
Following the Board of Stud-
ies Meeting in November, when
the idea of an Academic Direc-
tor was accepted and the
adoption of more diversified
courses was encouraged to de-
partments, the Registrar sent a
note to all Heads of Department
asking them to pursue the mat-
ter further. This departmental
level of representation is where
the chance of true participation
in College government might be.
A new course — "Science in
Society" is being prepared by
the Industrial Sociology Unit and
hopefully will be introduced into
most depts. next year. Get de-
tails off Chris Sheppard (Civil
Engineering Dept. Rep.), and
use your staff/student Committee
to make sure your Dept. gives
you this course as an option
next year.
P O S T G R A D U A T E S
Whilst P.G.'s are in no way
discriminated against by the
Union e.g.) Grants rises,
Ravenscourt Pk. Flats, Student
Welfare Services, Sports Facili-
ties. Entertainments, STOIC,
Felix, Clubs, etc., nevertheless
the involvement of postgradu-
ates within Union activities
always seems to fall well short
of that of undergraduates and
some of the P.G. problems that
are peculiar to them e.g.) Lab.
safety, Demonstrating Fees, etc.,
possibly don't get enough dis-
cussion. This may largely stem
from the greater isolation of
P.G.'s, both from U.G.'s and
also other fellow P.G.'s. To com-
bat this the Union Council will
be considering in the near future
plans for a P.G. affairs officer
and P.G. association.
REPRESENTATION
This has been a silent sub-
ject for the last year or so, but
still the Union lacks representa-
tion in such areas as choosing
Hall wardens, membership of
the Deans' Committee, etc.
STUDENT W A G E
In the midst of Press discus-
sions of the Consultative Docu-
ment Proposals, there was a
report in the Times of a recon-
sideration of the loans for P.G.'s
question. It is in this context that
students must develop the con-
cept of a student wage—a lot
of the work P.G.'s do is put to
use for industry, government,
etc.—P.G.'s should get paid for
this work. The concept of a stu-
dent wage is now widely accept-
ed by students—we must now
apply it to areas of difficulty,
e.g., long vacations, nature of
study, etc. to fix our own bound-
ary condition that would make it
feasible and not just a weapon
with which students could be
even more regimented by Col-
leges, e.g.) Southampton, where
some P.G.'s have to clock in,
and must work a minimum of 40
hours a week in the lab.
MINERS' STRIKE
Men, working in far from
pleasant conditions in many
cases, are taking home wage
packets of less than £20 a week
in a lot of cases. When there is
an enforced overtime ban by
the N.C.B. as there has been
recently in many areas, these
wage packets can drop as low
as £13-£14. How can students,
as a part of society, not want to
add their voice in this matter.
If you've got any comments—
come and see us in the Union
Office.
