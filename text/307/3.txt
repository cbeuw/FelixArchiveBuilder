Editorial
The new term has begun in a mode which suggests
that it intends to be typical. On Sunday, 23rd January
a march took place to demonstrate against the green
paper on students unions. I.C. had a turn out to lend
support to this worthy cause which was even surpassed
by our lovable police forces first class support of our
cause. There have also been two union meetings in
the first two weeks of term neither of which has been
quorate. Of course the important issues taking place
in the college bars and at the constituent college fun
sessions have, as usual, been well supported, together
with even more critical matters to be decided on the
playing fields of Harlington.
Please do not now derive the opinion that I object
to any of the activities mentioned in the last sentence,
except perhaps to excesses of the former. What I am
trying to illustrate is the important question of priorities.
If you believe that Piers Corbyn has a reasonable case
for complaint then you should be at the union meeting
to support it. If you think that he genuinely is a lazy
good for nothing and should be expelled from the col-
lege they you should be at the union meeting to stop
him spending YOUR money on his solicitors fees, not to
mention his attempts to spend your money on I.R.A.
bombs (you too can kill an Irish child). Whatever you
believe in you have a duty to express your opinion at
the union meeting above almost every other duty you
may have.
You may, of course, think that unions are silly and
how many pints of beer you can drink are the more
important part of your college life, after all would you
be as capable of damaging our halls of residence, etc.,
without them. Once again you are entitled to your
opinion but surely if you think that unions are silly you
should try and support Mrs. Thatcher's ideas in every
way possible, as they are guaranteed to get rid of it
for you (be careful, it may also get rid of a couple of
bars).
As however I have not seen anybody actively sup-
posing Mrs. Thatcher I can only deduce that everybody
who joins this solid body of apathy believes in true
apathy. Good for you. I'm always pleased to see some-
one with the courage of his convictions, indeed at the
present rate I too may give up hope for the future and
join your masses. Oh! but can I do that if I have actually
gone so far as to think about why I don't want to think
about anything. I'm confused, better go for a pint!
Returning refreshed to my desk I am feeling more
understanding towards the apathetic majority. It is an
historical fact that people are always apathetic until
they are united by good leadership. I must agree with
the concensus of opinion in the college that the present
technique of leadership breeds apathy in that it breeds
boredom. If we are to save our union and simultane-
ously, I believe, a lot of our interest in life, we must
urge our leaders to lead us or resign. This unfortunately
will never come to pass because to implement this we
need a quorate union meeting. Impossible they cried,
and cried, and cried.

Kouncil Kapers Piggies
Sir,
Yes, I'm afraid that it's an-
other slam at Council, last
night's in particular. I am con-
vinced that Council in it's pre-
sent form has ceased to perform
as a useful and contributory
area of ICU. Last night's mam-
moth session of 7i hours ade-
quately illustrates this view in
my opinion.
On the agenda were some
vitally important items, funda-
mental to the very aims and
objects of ICU, yet we were
stifled by obstruction, pettiness
and dogma. I would at this
point like to state quite categ-
orically that all was not wasted.
There was some useful and
meaningful discussion, but even
this was clouded. Piers Cor-
byn's academic affairs have
blown up again, in a very nasty
fashion. Council showed unan-
imity of thought, although Piers
was somewhat evasive as to
how much work he has actually
done of recent. Other points
were dealt with moderately
efficiently, such as Finance,
Minutes of the last meeting,
etc., and most of the reports.
The one report that caused
trouble was the Entg. report. It
would appear that too many
people are rumouring too much
about something they know all
too little. Even the President's
report was fairly uncontrovers-
iall
But then came the needle
issues. Student Union autonomy
and Structure of ICU. These two
issues were reduced to a level
of personal recrimination. I be-
lieve Council showed itself to
be unable to discuss vitally im-
portant topics in an adult and
rational manner. Within a short
space of time, the entire de-
bate was reduced to petty
bickering. Council actually man-
aged to pass judgement on an
ICUGM, the now infamous Dec.
2nd meeting, condemning the
filibustering that led to the pass-
ing of a motion of dubious sup-
port, and proceeded on the
next item of business to push
through an amended amend-
ment in a way that amounted
to little less than filibustering
again. Council spent 45 min-
utes discussing a procedural
motion on a point of order on
an amendment to a motion!
Both tempers and friends were
apparently lost in A\ hours of
temporary insanity.
I believe that Hobman and
Amos were pushing their luck
if they really thought that their
motion would be passed or
even discussed fully. It was per-
haps foolhardy to even propose
such an extreme motion as thev
did. Whether they proposed it
out of sheer spite, as was sug-
gested openly at Council, I
wouldn't like to say, but I
would like to think that Hobman
and Amos are more responsible
than that.
The opposers of the motion,
I believe, stifled discussion to
achieve its defeat and aid the
substitution of their own, with
the result that the whole issue
was inadequately debated. The
amended motion was then
effectively destroyed by further
amendments. We reached a
point when, after about 4 hours,
an amendment was proposed
and passed which negated all
that had been decided over the
past 4 hours. It was at this
point that ritual suicide
occurred. Council then voted to
ignore the vote they had just
passed, quite democratically at
that, and revots on the amend-
ment. Fortunately it was wittv
drawn before any further dam-
age could be delivered.
The amended motion was
passed in entirety shortly after,
with little more fuss.
The meeting Jacked an ex-
perienced Chair, although the
Chairman for the greater part
of the meeting should be con-
gratulated for his handling of
the proceedings, considering
that it was his first experience in
Chairing a major meeting. Mc-
Cullough showed that he was
not a good chairman and more-
over he showed that he was
prepared to go to considerable
degrees of obstruction to get
his own way when debating a
motion.
What can be learnt? Council
standing orders are totally un-
wieldy and may require exten-
sive alteration. Council is net
sufficiently flexible and relies too
heavily on procedure and pre-
cedent. Council is motivated too
greatly by personal opinion and,
dare I say it, personal gain, at
the expense of ICU as a whole.
Maybe, however, my last com-
ment was too uncharitable, but
Council members of the present
and future would do well to
bear this in mind to avoid this
accusation being made with
complete justification sometime
hence.
No one came out of this
meeting with anything approach-
ing clean hands, except per-
haps Dave Hobman's kitten who
was too young to know any
better. But there again Zee
must have had some thoughts
on the matter, as he expressed
them with clarity, dignity, and
proliferation dead in the centre
of the floor.
Yours, etc.,

Dear Sir,
We would like to inform
members of I.C. that an Ecolog-
ical Action Group has been
formed jointly by I.C. Society
for Social Responsibility in
Science and Wellsoc Pollution
Group.
The first project which we
have undertaken is that of re-
cycling used computer paper
which is at present wasted. We
intend giving it to the "Fight
for Sight" Charity, who will sell
it to paper mills for re-use.
We appeal to all computer
users to put their used com-
puter print-out in our collecting
boxes, which will shortly appear
in all depts.
If you are interested in the
group's activities, please con-
tact one of us.
Yours,
