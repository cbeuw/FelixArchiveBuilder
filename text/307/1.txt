A fight marred the start of the Demonstration on
Sunday against the government's proposals for Student
Unions. It began when members of the Liaison Commit-
tee for the defence of Student Unions and sympathisers
moved forward and surrounded the platform at Hyde
Park Corner when directions were being given to the
assembled multitudes. They were insisting that a miner
should speak to them about their struggle for more
money. Despite promises that a miner would be one of
the speakers at Trafalgar Square, the L.C.D.S.U. per-
sisted, shouting that they wanted one there and then,
and scuffles broke out amongst the ranks. Eventually,
after informing them that the microphone was "broken",
the mob quietened down and order was restored.
Imperial College, together
with the other USK colleges and
the Scottish contingent to whom
I.C. had played host the previ-
ous night, started the march
from Imperial Institute Road at
12.15. I.C. was completely out-
numbered by the others even
at this stage—there were, in
fact, probably only about 200 at
most of us. In comparison to
this, there were at least twice
as many from the rest of U.S.K.,
and as many again from the
Scottish universities. Flanked by
a goodly number of the fuzz,
they set off across Hyde Park to
join contingents from all over
the country at Hyde Park cor-
ner.
There everyone was split into
23 groups, depending on where
they came from. The Central
London crew and those from
Wales were probably the lar-
gest crowds, whereas others
were quite noticeable by their
absence. The assembly there
was well organised and unevent-
ful except for the scuffle men-
tioned above which happened
just before everyone was due
to move off at one o'clock.
Marching about eight abreast,
the demonstration went first
down Oxford Street, through the
intricacies of the one-way sys-
tem to Oxford Circus, down
Regent Street, across Picadilly
Circus and thence down Hay-
market to Trafalgar Square. The
NUS earlier predicted that
100,000 would turn out for the
march (which is decidedly opti-
mistic—the NUS only has
450,000 members in the whole
country); the official estimate
at 1.40, by which time the march
had reached Oxford Circus, was
20,000, and certainly, if they
were marching in the groups of
4,000 that they were supposed
to be in, that can't have been
far out. However, the march was
all the same very impressive—
it took 40 minutes for it to pass
down Haymarket, from which I
have just come.
Unfortunately for the cause,
many students decided not to
demonstrate on behalf of Stud-
ent Unions but for other causes
instead, notably that of the mine-
workers. In fact, while standing
at Hyde Park before departure,
when the officials asked over
the loudspeakers whether every-
one knew what they were de-
monstrating for, everyone titter-
ed merrily—but several near me
shouted "For the Miners!!"
There were so many slogans
on the march that it could have
been on behalf of almost any-
thing. Of the dozen or so pas-
sers-by that I asked, three
thought that they were demon-
strating for the miners, two for
school milk, and several others
thought it was just a general
anti-government march. One
even thought that it was about
about Rhodesia. Only one knew
what it was all about—the rest
were don't knows and don't
cares.
After speeches from union
officials and leaders from the
labour party and trade unions
2,000 of the demonstrators
moved on to the National Coal
Board headquarters, where they
chanted slogans of solidarity
with the miners. Perhaps the
NUM will have a demo for us,
some day.
Piers returns
to I.C.
"I am delighted and very grateful to all the students,
messengers and staff in I.C. and also up and down the
country who were so vocal in their support; especially
in political matters".
Piers Corbyn, in case you didn't know, has won his
appeal against the decision of the College to expel him.
In fact, as Piers pointed out,
since he had been working all
through the summer, he would
This simple statement gives
no hint of the actual events be-
hind the apparently suspicious
behaviour of the physics de-
partment. After all the case is
the first to use the appeal sys-
tem set up in 1966. What is
needed more than anything is
an accurate record of what has
been happening.
Piers began his career with
a Royal Scholarship to I.C.
where he wrote several scienti-
fic papers as an undergraduate
(e.g. measuring the eccentricity
of the Earth's orbit at home!).
He graduated with a 1st Class
degree in Physics, whereupon
he joined the Department to do
research in Solid State Physics.
He passed D.I.C. Theoretical
Physics in 1969.
It was then that his political
beliefs became obvious and as
President of I.C.U. in 1969-70
he was responsible for the dis-
tinctly leftish outlook of the
Union at that time.
He started research again in
70/71 and became the editor of
Sennet. This is recognised by
the College as an "accepted
University activity".
Over the summer vacation an
attempt was made to expel him
on grounds of insufficient work.
This dragged on for three
months when, in October, he
was allowed to remain only on
the grounds that he increased
his work considerably.
At this point the Physics De-
partment (in the person of Pro-
fessor Coles) and Piers began
to differ on the account.
Piers says that he thought the
warning in October had left him
with a "clean sheet" so far as
his college record went, and
that the letter informing him of
his expulsion came as a great
shock.
However, in a letter to Piers,
Professor Coles made it clear
that he never considered that
this was the case. Apparently,
he and Professor Matthews had
assumed that since the "deriva-
tive of his work rate" had re-
mained positive during August
and September, there was a
good chance that this would
continue. It was on this basis
that Piers was to be allowed
back.
need some form of holiday after
the possibility of expulsion had
been hanging over his head for
three months. This would ac-
count for the drop in his work
level.
One of the strongest points
in favour of him is a latter writ-
ten by one of the Department
professors saying that he con-
siders Piers Corbyn to have
done a sufficient amount of
work. This was later retracted
for some ill-defined reason but
all sorts of possibilities spring
to mind!
It also apepars that he was
having great personal difficulties
around this crucial time. In his
appeal to the physics depart-
ment he goes into great detail
about a "Mr. Farquerson and
friends". Apparently Mr. Far-
querson was a manic depres-
sive and often invited anyone he
came across back to his flat.
For example, 6 male prostitutes
and a "Hello Angel". Some
Australians who were living in
the flat made several calls to
Australia without saying and the
gas meter was robbed by per-
sons unknown. This resulted in
a telephone bill for £120 and
an electricity bill for £80!
He says that he probably
made an error of judgement in
not telling his supervisor (Prof.
Coles) of these troubles, and
admits that if he had asked for
a holiday at the time, the prob-
lem might have resolved itself.
Having read ail t he docu-
ments and letters conected with
the case, it seems to me that
this is an unfortunate example
of lack of communication be-
tween staff and students. The
Physics Department appears to
have acted very shortsightedly
in its aceptance of the apparent
facts of the issue. Perhaps spur-
red on by a dislike of Piers'
politics they tried to get rid of
him when an excuse presented
itself. Piers, as well, is guilty of
a similar lack of trust in his
supervisor.
If one thing is to be learnt
from this unpleasant affair it is
that the appeals system appears
to work, and is the best that can
reasonably be expected.
