REVIEWS
I've been writing about
films over the last term
and have scarcely men-
tioned the Film Society.
On the 4th February in the
Great Hall we are showing
Barney Piatts-Mills' BRON-
CO B U L L F R O G , which I
mentioned when I review-
ed his second film "Private
Road" last term. Barney
Platts-Mills is perhaps the
most promising British
Director to have emerged
in recent years. There is
the same basic theme —
the conflict between per-
sonal aspirations and the
restraints of society, but
Platts-Mills has focused his
attention on Del, a young
East Ender in a steady,
but soul destroying, job as
a welder and the film tells
of his attempts to escape
from this mainly to be
alone with Irene, his girl
friend. Bronco Bullfrog
has great glamour for Del
F I L M S
in that he has escaped
from Borstal. Del takes
Irene for a trip to the West
End which ends abortively
in a Wimpy bar. Del's
motor bike and their
attempts to start a new life
in the country are all des-
troyed. The film ends
abruptly where it is ob-
vious that Del and Irene
must bow to society's de-
mands in order to survive.
It sounds very pessimistic,
but even at the most pes-
simistic points the charac-
ters always seem to extract
excitement and impromptu
fun from their environment.
Filmed with an entirely
amateur cast, from an im-
provised script this film is
excellent. For a first film
from a British director it is
very good and due to the
lack of either sex or vio-
lence in the film it is un-
likely to obtain a general
release in this country. So
on the 4th February at 7.15
p.m. in the Great Hall I.C.
gets its chance. Also we
are showing Vittorio De
Sica's 1948 classic " B i -
cycle Thieves".
At last year's (1971)
London Film Festival the
film that opened the Fes-
tival was Jacques Tati's
latest film TRAFFIC. Even-
tually I caught up with the
film and it has been very
difficult to review. There
were several very funny
parts and many other parts
the rest of the audience
found funny (perhaps they
weren't in as much diffi-
culty with the French as I
was—a few subtitles help;
please distributors!), but
overall the film was a little
patchy, with long stretches
when nothing happened.
A very disappointing film
compared with his 1952
" M . Hulot's Holiday".
C E N T E N A R Y T O U C H S T O N E
Saturday, 4th December
1971 saw the start of the
" Centenary Touchstone "
—the 100th touchstone
since Sir Rodericks Hill
instigated the idea over 20
years ago.
The concept of "Touch-
stone weekends" has
changed little since its in-
ception and was admirably
explained in the last Felix
Touchstone report. Some-
thing of a nostalgic feeling
was instilled into the
group by the arrival, from
Lever Bros. Ltd., of a re-
plica of the original Touch-
stone symbol. A Port
Sunlight soapbox. The box
is admirably referred to as
"the box of free speech"
with the additional rider
"but not free licence". A
pity.
"America & Asia — a
clash of cultures?" the
weekend's topic, seemed
to cover the whole field of
discussion. Philip Calkins,
Professor of Indian History
at Chicago University was
available as Guest Speaker
to start the ball rolling and
then, very subtly and tact-
fully, guide it in the right
direction. The Professor
was much more the Ameri-
can academic: friendly,
sociable, young and inter-
ested — some contrast to
some of his British counter-
parts.
Much was said. The
speaker felt we were ques-
tioning whether Western
technology was something
which could be given to
underdeveloped nations,
provided we overcame
conservative, peasant and
religious prejudices.
Do you regard the East
as exotic? — almost cer-
tainly; if not, your mind will
probably conjure pictures
of religious ceremonies, or
a caste system, or just
poor, o v e r p o p u l a t e d
people. The exotic view
has certainly persisted
since Colonial times. In-
deed, it has been encour-
aged. The East cultivated
the religious view for be-
ing subject.
America, the speaker
felt, had regarded herself
as the protector of the
Chinese peoples—it never
had been, and was under-
standably hurt, like an
"unwanted parent", by the
Communist success in
1948.
The title certainly prov-
ed sufficiently provocative
to attract two American
students to the discussion,
though as a first-timer, I
couldn't help feeling that
the group was based on a
very hard core of regu-
lars. This is not by encour-
agement, and all are wel-
come.
I really think it's a pity
that more people don't try
a Touchstone weekend. It
is only £1. The next Touch-
stone speaker will be Mary
Whitehouse. I've booked.
RORY G A L L A G H E R
" D E U C E " (POLYDOR)
When Rory Gallagher
performs on stage he gives
his audience the thumbs
up sign quite a lot and
stomps about continu-
ously. He is undoubtedly
one of the most exciting
performers in Britain to-
day, but has the advantage
over other "exciting" per-
formers in that he is an
excellent guitarist, particu-
larly on slide guitar where
he ranks with Johnny Win-
ter and the late Duane
Allman. Don't miss the
chance to see him in the
Great Hall this weekend.
In the past, however, the
excitement of his music
seemed to melt away on
record. The temptations of
D I S C S
overdubbing in a modern
studio must have been too
much because he intro-
duced jazzy alto-sax which
sounded o.k. but just
didn't make it compared
to the raw rock which we
knew he was capable of.
Only "Live Taste" was
able to capture the atmos-
phere he engendered.
But this album is more
what I had in mind.
Almost certainly recorded
live in a studio with a bit
of crude production here
and there, and the result is
the best album he's done.
Of course it's not just the
feedback that makes it so
good. The songs are a lot
more meaningful than the
"I got a woman she's so
mean" lyrics with which
he's been associated. And
there's bassist Gerry Mc-
Avoy and drummer Wilgar
Campbell, so often over-
shadowed by Rory but
both very competent. As
well as the straight-ahead
rockers like "In Your
Town" (the best track)
there are Rory's attempts
to get into a purer blues
bag, like " Should've
Learn't My Lesson" and
"Out of My Mind", which
sounds a lot like Don
Partridge (remember?).
But most of the tracks
jump off the turntable and
punch you in the guts. A
fine album.
Late last term 1 went to
see "Dear Antoine" and
" A Day in the Death of Joe
Egg", both of which have
now, unfortunately, closed.
Both deserved the highest
praise —
+ "Joe E g g " for
the grey comedy with
which Peter Nichols col-
ours his picture of parents
caring for their 'vegetable'
child, and "Dear Antoine"
for Anouilh's slowly re-
vealed depths of emotion
and a magnificent "Coup
de Theatre" in the third
act.
But David Storey's "The
Changing Room" (Globe)
still lives. The play is set in
the Changing Room of a
Rugby League Club, and
its three acts occur before,
during and after a match,
as the players arrive and
change, come in at half-
time and are treated and
encouraged, and, eventu-
ally bath and drift away,
P L A Y S
less the one broken-nosed
player. There are none of
the usual motive-laden
speeches and all that we
learn of the players is
from their chatter — any-
thing else would have torn
the thin fabric of total
credibility. The fascination
in the play comes from
watching these thirteen
players come together (all
are part-time, though not
amateurs) and weld them-
selves into a unified team,
gradually dissembling at
the end. The image is of
men at work, not of actors
pretending to be some-
thing they are not, and if
I mention none of the cast
by name it is only because
they are uniformly good.
Lindsay Anderson of
"If . . . " and " H o m e "
directs this transfer from
the Royal Court.
"Getting O n " (Queen's)
was ultimately slightly dis-
appointing by contrast.
Alan Bennett (who wrote
the excellent and success-
ful "40 Years On") has
written a great play with
George (Kenneth More), a
middle-aged M.P. just
arriving, with his younger
wife (Gemma Jones), at
the point in their existence
when they realise that they
are "getting o n " in age as
well as career. Thrown in
are a comic Mother-in-Law,
misunderstood son, queer
Parliamentarian and se-
ductive decorator, to com-
plete Bennett's comic six.
There is a lot of very
funny material in the first
three-quarters of the play,
but then the play changes
down into a series of from-
the-heart dialogue with, I
am sorry to say, a drastic
crashing of its dramatic
gear-box. The play is good,
but it could have been
better.
