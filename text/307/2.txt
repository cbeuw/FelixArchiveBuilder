c Affairs
The start of the spring
term heralds the second
major session of most
Union activities, and this is
certainly so with Academ-
ic Affairs. It's thus a con-
venient time to look at "the
story so far", as well as
"what's in store for this
term".
The highlight of last
term was the submission
to the Board of Studies of
a paper reviewing the Div-
ersification of First Degree
Courses. Many depart-
ments allow, or even insist,
that studies include divers-
ified subjects, both to pro-
vide a more general edu-
cation, and to increase the
awareness of the scientist
or engineer in society.
This trend was welcomed
by our own Governing
Body, especially in view
of the increasing numbers
of our graduates entering
diverse career fields. Un-
fortunately, there are still
a few departments where
no such options are avail-
able.
As a result of the discus-
sion, the spirit of the paper
was commended to all de-
partments, and more de-
tailed discussion was
encouraged in depart-
ments. Also, the appoint-
ment of an "Academic
Director" at Professorial

level, to co-ordinate and

field, will be made before
the start of next session.
Departmental staff-stud-
ent committee systems
were discussed at some
length last term, and on
the whole were thought to
be functioning satisfactor-
ily. Their development in-
to central discussion for-
ums continues, and the
links between these com-
mittees and the Union are
very strong, thanks to the"
Departmental Reps.
However, there still
seems to be a reluctance
to "recognise" staff stud-
ent committees in the col-
lege infra-structure, and
communication on this
side could be greatly im-
proved.
This term sees us look-
ing in detail at tutorial and
assessment systems, as
well as the Union-wide dis-
cussions on the demo-
cratic organisation of the
college. So if you've any
strong views on these sub-
jects, just drop a note into
the Union Office.
Well, do you know when
your next staff-student
committee meeting is?
Union Tea Party
On Thursday of last week
there occurred a Union Meeting
in the Great Hall. However, to
call it this requires a good many
more people than actually
turned up. There could hardly
have been more than 100 and
this dwindled steadily through
the whole, long, boring one and
a half hours. The dictionary
defines "boring" as "to weary
by uninteresting talk" and I
couldn't agree more.
Stopping now would give an
accurate account of this disas-
ter but as some important
topics were dragged to the sur-
face by various people sitting
at the front I must continue.
After the reading of the
minutes the president woke up
to challenge the quorum. Dave
Amos then informed us that this
meeting of ICU would now be
known as "a gathering of IC
students". This, therefore, in-
validated all the votes taken
later although Dave Hobman
said the discussion would help
to formulate the executives'
ideas on certain subjects.
There were three main topics
to be discussed: Piers Corbyn;
Northern Ireland; NUS emer-
gency conference on Jan. 29/30.
At the last meeting Piers spent
the whole time talking about
himself and as a consequence
the rest of the agenda had to
be postponed until Thursday.
These two subjects would in
themselves have taken a long
time without the first three-quar-
ters of an hour being taken up
by Piers himself. He spent this
time in congratulating himself
and others in their magnificent
struggle against the politically
inspired attempt of the college
to expel him. In the process he
accused John McCullough of
helping them and said he con-
sidered the union vote in his
favour as one of no-confidence
in the president. Annoyance (or
was it dismay?) flickered across
his face as he was told then
that the assembly had no power
to pay his solicitor's fees and
that he would have to wait for
the next meeting before this
could be discussed.
The Northern Ireland motion
was sensibly put forward by
John Sommer as a counter to
the likely massive support for
the IRA at the emergency con-
ference. The essence of this
document is the belief that vio-
lence of any kind cannot pro-
duce an acceptable solution and
only a political answer can be
lasting. As this has not had your
support the motion will go to
the conference under the head-
ing of external affairs. Piers had
recommended that the whole
document be changed with the
most ridiculous statement "ICU
believes that the British Army is
imperialist" giving the general
level of his alterations.
By this time the first hour and
one quarter had just passed and
it was difficult to decide who
was more bored; the president
or the vice-president. Things
livened up a bit, however, when
they started shouting at each
other over the amount of busi-
ness included in each meeting.
Another quarter of an hour was
too much and the "group of IC
students" quietly dissolved.
Now of course you will say,
"Well I'm glad I didn't go. It was
just as bad as I thought it would
be". But you are making a fun-
damental mistake. Of course, it
was badly advertised, badly laid
out, badly planned (?), but these
things are only likely to change
if enough people can be both-
ered to come along. The worst
striking thing is the amount of
students at a meeting discussing
a controversial issue. However,
the important everyday business
of a union is rarely interesting
but it must be supported. There
is little point fighting to save
your union if no one wants to
make use of its most important
aspect. We might as well have a
purely social organisation with
no power to affect college policy.
Think twice before missing
the next one!
