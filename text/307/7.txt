SPORTS FELIX
Ist XI Take Easy Win
IMPERIAL 1 5
THAMES 1 1
After a 4 goals to 2
away win last term I.C. I.
must have taken the field
clear favourites to win
t h i s League game.
Straight from the kick off
I.C. took the game to their
often predictable oppon-
ents. At this stage IC were
much quicker and more
decisive than Thames,
they had practically taken
over complete control of
the midfield and were con-
tinually pressurising the
Thames defence.
All this pressure deser-
ved a goal which duly
came from a corner taken
by John Kelly, who found
Mick Pearson's head; the
header was parried but
Pearson made no mistake
from the rebound. After
this goal I.C. maintained
the pressure; a precision
pass from John Kelly put
Bill Milne clear of a static
Thames defence and
Milne added the second
with only the goal-keeper
to beat. These goals see-
med to give I.C. the confi-
dence they really needed;
they began to move the
ball very effectively and
only some very near mis-
ses from Pete Bartlett and
Byron Smith kept the goal
tally down. I.C. mounted
attack after attack and
very rarely was Mick Whit-
ham, the I.C. goal-keeper,
brought into the game. It
was from one of these at-
tacks that a Thames de-
fender was forced to
handle the ball and Noel
Fryer made no mistake
from the spot to make the
score 3—0 at half time.
The second half saw
I.C. rather complacent
and their play rather spas-
modic. This allowed
Thames to come more in-
to the game, but I.C. still
seemed to keep them well
under control and they ad-
ded two more goals
through Bill Milne and Ian
Rodgers before Thames
snatched a consolation
goal.
However, even with this
convincing result I.C. I.
will certainly not have any
sympathy for Thames
when they meet in the 2nd
round of the U.L. Cup on
Saturday, 22nd January
and hopefully, at least,
there will be no complac-
ency.
Team:— M. Whitman,
M. McGrath, A. Baker, G.
Willcock (capt), M. Pear-
son, N. Fryer, B. Smith, P.
Bartlett, B. Milne, J . Kelly,
I. Rodgers.
Successful Badminton
Tour
A series of mini-tours
was arranged last term for
mainly the 1st and 2nd
teams.
The first of these invol-
ved 11 people consisting
of seven 1st team men and
four ladies.
On Friday 14th January
such names as:—
Hilary Rowson (Ladies
Capt.)
Sue Thompson
Brenda Dilley
Janet Roberts
G. Georgiou (Mens Capt.)
S. Donald
'Souki'
D. Ward
R. Palmer
C. Gaukvoger
D. Thomas
set off for the long trek up
north, fully equipped with
badminton gear, supplies,
oranges, oranges . . . or-
anges. Our destination
was Leeds where we were
to play Leeds University
on Saturday afternoon. We
played a 'county' style
match which we unfortun-
ately lost 1—6; neverthe-
less a lot has to be said
about the team Leeds tur-
ned out and how close
some of the games were.
Fielding 5 B.U.S.F. repre-
sentatives out of their
team of 8 we did extrem-
ely well to contain them at
11—6.
The 1st event was the
Mens singles, which invol-
ved S. Donald, G.
Georgiou, D. Ward. Don-
ald played No. 1 against
P. Bullivant, who was
B.U.S.F. champion (sin-
gles) 69—70. Donald lost
two straight sets, but de-
fiantly gave Bullivant a
tough time. Fitness was
what Donald lacked and
not ability. Georgiou was
against their Wo. 2 (No. 3
in disguise), whilst Ward
lost narrowly 13—18, 18—
14, 12—15.
The ladies, unfortunat-
ely, lost both their singles
to make I.C. 4—1 down.
In the mens doubles
there was a great fight
back when I.C. won 3 out
of 4 games, but the ladies
again fell. The final score
of 11—6 against included
wins by the mixed doubles
where special mention
must be made about Miss
Rowson who kept her cool
whilst facing Bullivant.
On Sunday morning we
set off to Bradford and
fielded the rest of the
team who were unable to
take part at Leeds. I.C.
won 9—6.
In the mens singles, I.C.
lost both. Chris Gaukvo-
ger's inexperience being
responsible for his losing
to a B.U.S.F. player. Miss
Thompson beat a large
girl (handicapped by her
weight) and the teams
shared the mens doubles.
The ladies saved the day
by taking 3 out of the 4
games whilst I.C. cruised
out winners overall after
the mixed doubles.
On the whole this was a
successful tour, indicating
the standard of badminton
at I.C.
Rugby
On the first Wednesday
of the term I.C. 1st XV
played City University
(again) at Colliers Wood
and came away victorious
by 29 points to 0. Although
City 1st XV were below
strength, it was an excel-
lent performance by I.C.
and augurs well for the
many (we hope) cup mat-
ches this term.
City University won the
toss and elected to play
with a stiff breeze and the
sun on their backs. This
however was to no avail
as I.C. was immediately on
the attack. Several hand-
ling movements by the I.C.
backs worried the City de-
fence while the pack was
always prominent with
their constant backing up.
The first try came after
Chris Flanagan had made
a penetrating run only to
be stopped 5 yards short.
From the resulting scrum
Andy Tebbett robbed the
opposing scrum half to
touch down close to the
posts. James converted.
Other scores came in
the first half when John
McDonough scored wide
out and James kicked a
penalty to bring the half
time score to 13—0.
I.C. turned around and
were again immediately on
the attack. Bill Baines
scored under the posts, as
did Roy (I've got more
tries than you James)
Matthews. James conver-
ted both. The final score
came after a handling
movement amongst the
forwards (in which even
that celebrated prop
(eh?) C. M. Wrigley took
part) resulting in Ozi
touching down in the cor-
ner. After this the game
tended to stagnate and
the final score was 29—0.
Team:— J . Hughes, J .
McDonough, B. Baines, P.
Pilkington, J . Hunt, A.
James (capt.), C. Flan-
agan, C. Wrigley, H.
Michael, M. Surge, R. Mat-
thews, I. Partridge, A. Teb-
bett, I. Rays, D. Osborne.
Winks
I.C. Winks team crashed
to a 36—27 win in South-
side upper lounge last
Tuesday, thus losing their
unbeaten beaten record,
maintained in living mem-
ory. The match was the
first the team has played
in the newly formed Lon-
don League, the visiting
team being from the Na-
tional Westminster Bank.
They tried to gain psychol-
ogical advantage by ap-
pearing in a uniform of
suit and tie, but I.C. coun-
tered with a display of in-
credible disorganisation
which evidently disturbed
their cool. The home
team's policy of multiple
substitution brought accu-
sations of cheating, com-
pletely unfounded, but did
cause great confusion on
the score card. The result
was agreed upon as the
best of the possibilities,
but it was I.C.'s game all
the way, especially after
the second round, which
we won 18-3, and after the
opposition's 10th round
from Southside Bar. One
member of the Bank team
was seen to be seriously
put off a vital shot by the
mention of the word 'beer'
by a colleague, and thus
some credit for our vic-
tory must go to them. The
match was rounded off by
a look at Dick's porno
mags to see what we had
missed playing winks.

EDITORIAL
The term has started quietly with clubs preparing
for the next round in their respective competitions. Be-
tween the time of writing and publishing, the Rugby,
Football and Ladies Hockey Clubs should have played
in their second round matches against tough opposi-
tion, and we hope to see all three Clubs in the third
round (semi finals!).
Because Mrs. Thatcher has managed to deflate the
situation with respect to Student Union Finance, it does
not mean that Sports Clubs and their members should
forget about the whole issue — she may try a new
ploy. We must continue analysing the latest in fanatici
which is to be found in the newspapers and from l.c.U.
In the middle of February A.C.C. would like to know
what exotic places (within the London boundary!)
Clubs are thinking of visiting, and what sort of support
a tour would receive from within the club. The reputa-
tion of tours of being drinking orgies (not subsidised)
is quite true! But the honour of the club is at stake
and captains have ambitions about winning the odd
match. Meanwhile, it is a great opportunity for people
of perhaps lesser ability to play alongside better players
and hence learn more about their particular game.
Congratulations must be levelled at the Swimming
Club Committee for taking the initiative and organising
a major International Water Polo tournament in the I.C.
pool. The competition took place last week, and it is
hoped that some of you saw some of the very high
standard of Polo that was played.
John Banks
Trophy goes to
I.C.
The Cross Country team
started the term in fine
style by winning the John
Banks Trophy for the first
London College in the
"Q.M.C. 7i" on Saturday
(15th).
A classy 140 strong field
started the gruelling 7\
mile race over heavy
plough and deep mud with
occasional ditches and
stiles. A promising start
by Ed Wiliams ended in
injury, but Rob Parker,
reaping the benefits of his
heavy Christmas training
programme, had a fine run
in 24th place. The main
pack was led by Matthew
Smyth (56th) running bet-
ter than ever, with Ed Wil-
liams (57th) after coming
through from the back. An
unfit Rog Phelps was 60th
with Pete Lewis (68th)
running very well. Paul
Clarke ran steadily in 69th
place and Rich Wilson was
63rd. Dave Jones (107th)
completed the scoring
eight with Rob Maddison
running as an individual,
112th.
The race was won in
40.52 by Chris Garforth
(Cambridge) with Doug
Gunstone (Cambridge, ex
L S E ) , third. The first Lon-
don runner was Bob
Reeves (Q.M.C.) in 9th.
Rob Parker was the sec-
ond London runner.
The team result was, 1st
Cambridge, 2nd Leeds,
3rd Oxford, 6th Imperial
College. 22 teams were en-
tered.
