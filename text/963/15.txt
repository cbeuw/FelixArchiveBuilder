Not as outrageous as expected, in
fact were quite sweet, this may
refute riot .grrrl ideals but did
manage to sarcastically pot Belly
(playing in the main hall)—the kind
of music easily consumed, which
sticks around in your stomach for
a while, but only for unrestrained
release.
The Taxis however, musically
suggested direction, oozed and
tempted yo-
i, but left you without,
leaving just a thought of the
ephemeral joys possible, yet I am
a classic new man, slapper, lad, a-
hole, pratt, slut etc.
Did sense the cliquish facade
amongst the Voodoo Queens,
Huggy Bear etc, but appeared down
to earth in reality, and though
recently written that they wer
worried about inherent male
control, this didn't seem the case.
Presumably because I was just
another ignorant male surface
indulger.
Would've liked to see them
angrier, but love them or hate them,
they gave 100%.

If it wasn't for the hundreds of
others standing around me I'd have
cried. It's not that I'm embarrassed
to show my emotions but it
wouldn't have been worth the
effort. It seems I was in a majority
of one. Everyone else was singing
along, it was like a football crowd.
That must be the ultimate. When
you become so famous that the fans
at Arsenal know the words, when
every man, woman, baby, dog
knows what size shoes you take.
Heaven help me. I want just the
music. I don't want all this other
crap.
It was when they did a cover of
a David Bowie song that I left. It
was all too much, I can't remember
which one it was and it matters not
one iota. What did they think they'd
gain from doing this? No one can
imagine the pain I felt, when
something that you cherish goes,
the hole that's left hurts more than
I care to say. 'It's like being
castrated at the moment of orgasm.'
Thanks Jarvis, at least someone out
there understands.

What the hell am I doing here in the
Albert Hall with my father? The
friendly, bearded face of safe guitar
songs and coffee-table books has
drawn a predictably balding,
overweight, Montego driving,
'satellite T V and a mortgage'
audience out of Suburbia. Away
from their Estate Agents' desks,
behind which they undoubtedly pine
the plasticity and inoffensive nature
of the fundamentally air-guitarable
seventies, off-handed mish-mashes
that some have had the gaul to
describe as innovative and creative.
They are resolute in their
knowledge of what is about to
happen. Two hours of back
catalogue. A living, breathing
greatest hits album for them to sing
along and finger-pick their belt
buckles to. A user-friendly tell your
mates in the office-a-thon to which
they will bring their wives as a
birthday present. (Oh lovely
dear how thoughtful.)
We stand on our shamefully
cheap balcony (if you can describe
£14.50 cheap), and I revile at my
inevitable metamorphosis into one
of these bastard sons of the post-
Thatcherite middle-earth that is
Dagenham or Cowley Depres-
sing.
While I am in mid-sigh, two
thousand enamoured Persil users
break into an infatuated peel of
applause for their messiah as he
ambles solitarily to his chair. He is
handed a polished acoustic guitar.
'Nice to be back in civilisation'
he beams in an - I've just spent the
week in Los Angeles winning
Grammy awards and letting people
give me money - sort of way. He
looks around demonically.
An enormous 'plink' fills the
arena as a twenty five ton penny
drops inside my head Fukin'
'ell Fu, Kin, E l .
Bessie Smith . Then some Robert
Johnson straight out of the delta.
This is circa 1930. The fat bastards
look puzzled. Charlie Patten, then
suddenly, a dash northwards to
Chicago and a pianist turns up on
stage. Big Bill Broonzy and the
Muddy Waters version of 'Rolin'
and Tumblin'. What the more
musicians, a drummer (sic), a
harpist (who looks a bit like Paul
Butterfield but isn't thank God?
mmmmm I'll get back
to you), Duck Dunn the Bass
player, and Andy Fairweather-Low
(who's been running on and off
stage like Glenys Kinnock doing
encores) arrive.It's now the early
50s. Elmore James, an Otis Span
and then the ultimate 'Fuck You, I
won't do what you tell me !', 'Forty
Four', Howlin' Wolf from the '54
Chess sessions. God damn this
blokes got some balls. 44 is so
cacophonic, it even pushes the
limits of music, let alone blues.
People (my old man among them)
are walking out. Muddy Waters
follows, late 50s stuff, the Forty-
somethings scratch their receding
hairlines. Someone screams out
'Layla' - he bleeds in an
undisciplined and, frankly, erratic
manner when I drive a chair leg into
his eye socket. After a quick flash
around with the mop, we flit
southwards to Philidelphia, and the
Stax sound of the early-mid 60s.
'Born Under a Bad Sign'- wait,
wasn't Duck Dunn on the original
Albert King version? I ' l l
check what do you mean
probably? you've ruined my
entire paragraph. I dig out the
album and it doesn't say. Ah ! let
it, sure he's an ugly auld bastard on
a good day.
They hate it and I'm laughing in
their faces for it. It's an hour before
the first guitar solo. Skin shedding
bottle-neck atop an old Buddy Guy
classic. Dubious introduction
though, and I'm left thinking
maybe.
Sure enough, the inimitable M r
Guy strolls out for the encore and
plays in his usual 'first thing I think
of style (complete with chicken
impressions).
The last number goes back to
Bessie Smith and the 1930s. If I
took the notion/to go and jump into
the ocean/ain't noboby's business if
I do - Couldn't have put it
better myself. What a summation of
the whole experience. Clapton is
totally rich, has nice clothes,
attractive girlfriends, dead children
and a huge back catalogue that
breeds money like nothing on earth.
Now he's just played his cliquiest
blues set ever and walked off with
a self-satisfied grin.
Disappointingly, he will never get
the real sound of all those old tunes,
one reason being his guitar is
always in tune. Neither will he be
one of the greats - particularly with
the likes of Hubert Sumlin and
Buddy Guy still running around
showing people what it should
sound like for real. However, the
total blues package that has gone
over the heads of Mr and Mrs Desk
Job tonight can command nothing
but respect from afficionados of the
genre, and the revelation that
perhaps he's not a wanker after all.
Alienating a whole audience is
nothing if not extreme, so why do
it ? because he can.
