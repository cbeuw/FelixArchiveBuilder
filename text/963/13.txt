24 March 1993
As Clinton made his inaugural
speech, champagne corks popped
and all eyes were fixed on the
satellite link-up. The Labour party
had been given front-row,
complementary, velvet-lined seats
and the picture they were watching,
was "The way we might have been'.
If John Smith can't deliver the
goods then he will be given the hoof
by someone who can. The most
serious challenges to himself and
Margaret Beckett come inthe shape
of Tony Blair (Shadow Home
Secretary) and Gordon Brown
(Shadow Chancellor).
Tony Blair is very bright and
streetwise—he recently said 'Hell'
on Walden, and talked
authoritatively about 'sex' in a letter
to the Sunday Times. In a debate on
terrorism recently he had Tory
bulldog Kenneth Clarke giggling
nervously as he saw his chances of
becoming Britain's-next-Chancellor
visibly wither. Blair's rapier thursts
into the Home Secretary drew cries
of delight from Labour's back
benches. Beside him, John Smith
and Margaret Beckett looked on,
doubtless proud, but for all that,
they looked a little glum. In another
life Blair might have been their
clever young son, who had come
back from university full of new-
fangled ideas and now no longer
treated them with the respect they
deserved.
Gordon Brown is also very clever
and often looks very cross.
Although he makes Labours' plans
for the economy sound dull, he will
be able to wake people up by hitting
them with a big mallet. These are
the things people need to know
about future party leaders. Blair has
repeatedly called for galvanising
new policies which is also nice to
know. Recently they both went to
Washington to meet top Clinton
aides. They learnt some valuable
lessons; Bill Clinton was elected
because people liked him. In order
to make people like you you must
tell them what they want to hear.
Clinton promised everybody
everything, and he played the
saxophone as well. If the Haitians
have to stay at home and he has to
raise taxes, the comforts of the Oval
office will help take the edee off his
idealistic despair. (The Tories have
known this for a long time. Even
when there is a recession at election
time they never mention it.) Both
Blair and Brown are part of the
generation of Labour M P ' s who
have never experienced
government. This means that when
they are hauled up by Messrs
Prescott, Dobson and Skinner, (on
the subject of Labour's historic past
links with the unions, municipal
ownership, socialism) they will be
able to pretend not to remember.
This may make some people bitter,
but everyone else will understand.
Resisting the temptation to ditch
Smith over the nearest cliff
Labour's progressives stepped up
demands for 'radical new policies'.
Right behind them thundered the
old guard threatening that the party
was 'too right wing' and that there
had better not be 'too many new
bloody policies'. Charting the
delicate path between the leadership
launched 'The Commission for
Social Justice'. This was an
independent review of all aspects of
Social Policy, including the
universality of benefits with
reference to a demographically
changing society. It had never been
easy to make the Citizen's Charter
look like a really Big Idea, but
where Downing Street policy
advisers and hard-man William
Waldegrave failed, the 'new
Beveridge report' stepped in to do
the trick. Theoretically it should be
difficult to disagree with a report
which promises everything, but not
for the Labour party. Though the
idea was almost fainting with its
own worthiness, the fact that it
wouldn't deliver until 1994 and then
might throw out some of Labour's
most sacred principles meant that
like the dregs of an old box of
Quality Street, there was something
to disappoint everybody.
This is John Smith's big problem;
how to reconcile the irreconcilable,
how to hold within the arms of one
party those whose motto is
'Downing Street and don't spare the
horses' and those whose motto is
'Everyone must go back to the old
days'. In edging toward the middle
ground he runs the risk of bumping
into M r Major, and with talk of
'rights and freedoms of the
individual, they could even swap
speeches. Both have recently given
keynote addresses to the party
faithful, and the temptation to rattle
on at length was resisted by neither.
Mr Major spoke wistfully about
village bakeries, and threw in some
high-Tory paternalism which
doubtless held his Carlton Club
audience (average' age seventy-plus)
in thrall.
Mr Smith tried to engage in
promoting policies which were both
indivualist and collective whilst
ignoring any inherent contradiction.
Both shared similar themes in some
respects. The problems of timeshare
policy; on Europe; on Health and
on Social Policy are more damaging
to Labour than to the
Conservatives, since Labour have
less room to manoeuvre.
If the sight of Blair and Brown
discussing 'New Paths To Victory'
with American spin-doctors does
not worry John Smith, then the sight
of Robin Cook sipping dry white
wine along side them should. Cook
is one of the most impressive of the
shadow cabinet, not least because
of his ability to maul any
government minister who falls in
his way—he is said to 'look like
Lenin, though without his sense of
humour,' and he has warned that
Labour may never win and election
again. He has never stood for a
leadership position himself on the
grounds that he is not populist, but
having managed both Kinnock and
Smith's campaign for the
leadership, he may well be
preparing to play bridesmaid for a
third time.
John Smith may be left to play out
a period of usefulness, and then be
challenged some time in 1994. To
Blair's advantage are his youth and
obvious ambition. Clinton may
have entered Washington on a bus,
but Blair and Brown availed
themselves of a stretch limo with all
mod cons. They needn't worry, it
is just this kind of rapacity which
will attract votes. People who want
cars will vote for people who have
got them.
Of course, even Blair and Brown
may not be successful, as Britain
cautiously noses out of the
recession, the next four years can
be expected to deliver modest
growth. As other European
countries are heading into decline;
Germany has broken its back over
re-unification costs; France seems
racked up on high interest rates it
cannot afford; even the mighty
Japanese are paying the price for
gross Capital expenditures of the
late eighties. Britain has at least
weathered most of the worst. Four
years down the line things may look
a little brighter for the Tories, who
knows? Either way whether it is
Smith or Blair, or someone else
leading the Labour party, it will be
impossible to ignore that this party's
future hangs over the edge of the
abyss.
