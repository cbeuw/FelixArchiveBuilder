No, I haven't gone mad. Don't
be so parochial. So what if I want
to review books written for the 3-6
age group? There's an important
market to be tapped out there. Now
that Imperial College Union has
done the right thing by the Day
Nursery with the type of legal
opinion last seen in the Maastricht
debate last month, we have to cater
for our younger members. It also
means I get a few cheap presents to
distribute when I go home at Easter.
At a rough stab, The Wizard,
the Fairy and the Magic Chicken
is for the younger of the age band,
anything from 3-5 years. It starts
with promise. There once lived a
Wizard, a Fairy and a Magic
Chicken. Each thought, 7 am the
greatest in the world' and tried to
outdo the others. And each was
jealous of the other two. And that
spelled trouble, a lot a trouble....
Stations of the T i d e
by M i c h a e l S w a n w i c k
This is a strange book. Well written
and readable yet somehow it does
not suck you into the plot.
The plot is good. A story of an
extensive galactic civilisation where
the spread of high technology onto
under-developed worlds is
controlled. However, an item of
contraband technology has been
taken by Gregorian back to his
home planet of Miranda and the
Bureaucrat has been sent to retrieve
it.
First he must find Gregorian, and
this is essentially what the book is
about. The man has a God-like
status and following, and finding
him is difficult and dangerous.
The characters are not being
forced from one situation to another
with nebulus plot links as you might
expect in books of this genre. But
the plot moves naturally along and
the characters come nearer their
goal.
An original and descriptive book,
but lacking some pace and urgency,
which could make it a nice Sunday
afternoon read.

OK, I lied. It isn't a work of
children's fiction after all. It's a
well researched, carefully
documented account of the
workings of the senior management
on the 5th floor. Substitute the
Cashier, the Stocktaker and
Lieutenant Khartoum as you wish.
'MY wand has a PICKLE on it, 'said
the Magic Chicken'. Just like
College executive, with that turkey
explaining how he's going to solve
the pickle cause by the purchase of
Clayponds and the non-sale of
Montpellier, for example. 7 can
kiss a pig,' said the Wizard. Well,
we knew that. By the way, the pig
ends up as a singing frog. Hmmm.
The end of this story is beautiful.
For the veryfirst time, the Wizard,
the Fairy and the Magic Chicken
agreed. 'RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!'
they shouted. As seems to be the
norm with kiddies books, this one
is vibrantly coloured, rather like the
new breed of university chemistry
texts. Purple is used rather well,
and the ferocious monster looks
rather benevolent, even
ChancelloroftheExchequer like.
The front of Prehistoric
Pinkerton shows a large,
Marmaduke (Hussey?) -like dog
dreaming about being a dinosaur,
which seems to be hatching, well,
pups. This unusual lesson in animal
reproduction aside (bit like Alien,
T h e B u t c h e r Boy,
by Patrick M c C a b e
A measure of this book's brilliance
can be gauged by Neil Jordan
(producer of 'The Crying Game')
buying its film rights. The book was
the 1992 winner of the Irish
Times/Aer Lingus prize for fiction
and is published, appropriately
enough, on St Patrick's Day (17th
March).
The story centres on a boy,
Francis Brady, growing up in a
small rural town in Ireland in the
1960s. Small events and childhood
jealousies combine to lessen his grip
on reality. Thus begins a gradual
descent into his own fantasy world
which is very selective about what
it incorporates from the real world.
It is an inherently tragic story, but
is very wryly amusing when Francis
offers his opinions on facets of Irish
life (especially the Church!). This
book will leave a lasting impression
on you that far outweighs its
brevity. It shall take its place among
the classics of modern Irish
literature.
I just hope that Tom Cruise
doesn't get the lead role in the film.

really), the large dog appears to
have teething problems, which
enable him to become a bit of a
beaver and eat trees. Oh, it's a
Great Dane pup, is it? First we had
the Budweiser Clydesdales, now we
have the Carlsberg Pups.
I instinctively dislike kids' books
with the words 'stegosaurus' or
'diplodocus' in them. The portrayal
of the natural historian in the book
is a nice example of how not to do
it. It is no wonder scientists
complain. Firstly, the dinosaur
specialist is called
'Zandorfosaurus', which doesn't
roll off the average five year old
tongue with great ease. Then, he is
described as devoting all his life to
collecting bones. Great. That will
inspire kids up and down the land.
The drawings show him as some
sort of fat, idiotic dentist, and given
the sympathy of children is going
to be with the dog, it doesn't help
to have him shout, firstly, What are
those children doing? No one is
permitted to approach the skeleton,
and then It's a dog. Alert the pound!
Surround the mongrel. This is all
topped off with that beautiful
dialogue,
- That's absurd. The museum
wouldn't think of displaying a
common tooth!
- This is the closest you will come
to meeting a real dinosaur, and
A M o r n i n g For F l a m i n g o s
by J a m e s Lee Burke
A routine assignment transporting
two prisoners to their executions
goes fatally wrong when they try to
escape. Dave Robicheaux is
brutally wounded and is set on
revenge.
In an attempt to recover his own
sense of self, he is persuaded by the
D E A to go undercover as a drug
dealer in New Orleans. His life
quickly becomes a nightmare as he
becomes increasingly involved in
the life of a mafia don. The
mysteries of Cajun voodoo magic
add another twist to the story.
The drugs and detection are
mixed in with the family life of
Robicheaux, his Vietnam
experiences and the injustice and
persecution felt by the 'people of
color in southern Louisiana'.
James Lee Burke has a very vivid
style of writing, with the ability to
conjure up a perfect image in only
a few words. This along with the
contrasting violence and personal
touches makes this one of the best
detective novels I have read in quite
some time

lot friendlier.
I wouldn't buy this one, thanks.

This is a true story: the PMS case
that made legal history. Maybe I
was the wrong person to read this,
being male and not having
personally experienced P M S
(premenstrual syndrome), but I was
interested nonetheless.
The describes the life of Nicola who
up to the age of 14 was a successful
dancer, hard working and a bright,
happy girl in a just as successful
family. Things then started to go
wrong. Her relationship with her
mother turned sour; she began to
overeat and then force herself to
vomit; she went to a dance school
then gave up dancing and she ran
away from home. By the time she
was 18 she was in Holloway Prison
being charged with arson on two
accounts, endangering life and
intent to kill. Whilst in prison she
had attempted suicide by slashing
her wrists, hanging herself and
drowning. The doctors,
psychiatrists and lawyers were
ready to send her to Broadmoor for
the criminally insane.
However, her parents worked long
and hard showing much love for
nicola, trying to prevent this. Her
mother, Pam, was the one who kept
pointing out that Nicola's life had
only changed so dramatically since
her periods had started. They found
a doctor (female) who could help.
For the last four years of her life
she had been various tranquillizers
that had no effect other than
removing her from reality or
turning her into a zombie. The cure
for Nicola's problem was described
as a miracle ('though today it is
known as the 'pill'), as not much
was really understood about PMS.
The book is fairly well written apart
from the opening of the first couple
of chapters which nearly made me
put the book down before I'd
started. However, as I got into it I
found myself pulled into Nicola's
life. It's a good book which has
given me some insight into the
nightmare which women can suffer
from, 'though it also left me quite
bemused.
