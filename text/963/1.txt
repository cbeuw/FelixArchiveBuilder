IC Student Wins Security Catch a Thief
An Imperial College student was
elected as a sabbatical of the
University of London students'
Union (ULU) in controversial
circumstances last week.
Ben Hancock was elected to the
post of Vice President (Finances
and Societies) at a meeting of
ULU's General Union Council
(GUC). G U C is a body made up
students of the University of
London who have been sent to
represent their colleges to the
University. This group of up to
eighty people, then chooses who
should then be elected to spend a
year paid representing students at
the whole of London University.
Voting takes place at the meeting
following speeches by and questions
to the candidates.
The hustings and voting could
have been best described as a
rollercoaster ride for Ben Hancock.
He began the evening having been
banned from his candidature. Under
the GUC election rules a candidate
is only allowed to produce one sheet
of A 4 paper to publicise
themselves. In Issue 962 of Felix an
interview with M r Hancock was
published, this was ruled to have
contravened the regulations of the
election. In a compromise move,
the elections committee then ruled
that M r Hancock would be allowed
to stand as a candidate and answer
questions, but not give a speech to
GUC.
This held until the speeches for
the post started, and the barring
from the post took place. Confusion
reigned for at least an hour and a
half while speakers, including other
candidates for the same post and
U L U sabbaticals, demanded that
Mr Hancock be allowed to put his
case. Ellie Merton, U L U Vice
President (Communications and
Welfare) as acting returning officer
refused to submit to overwhelming
pressure from the floor to change
the election committee's decision
and allow M r Hancock to speak.
Danny Chippeck, U L U Vice
President (Sports and Recreation)
along with David Pellor, Senate for
Law, hoth executive members of
U L U lead the revolt and forced a
vote which conclusively overturned
the elections committee ruling.
After the vote had been passed one
member of the election committee
resigned before the hustings process
could continue as planned.
With all the votes cast Ben
Hancock was declared the winner
after three recounts, beating the
nearest contender, Paul Phillips, by
thirty five votes to thirty.
Commenting after the result had
been announced, M r Hancock said
that he did not believe that he had
benefited from the publicity
generated by the controversy. He
said he was very pleased but
believed that his policies had been
responsible for his victory.
In a separate contest the post of
U L U President was won by Simon
Rix. M r Rix overcame opposing
candidate, Annie Hawkins, by
thirty nine to thirty five votes. The
other sabbatical post contested at the
G U C was Vice President
(Communications and Welfare).
Sara Ragab was the only candidate.
She was not present at the meeting
. and was beaten by Re-open
nominations, a similar device to
New Election used in Imperial
College. Next year's London
Student editor will be Liz Llewelyn,
the present assistant editor.

A suspected thief was arrested
following a chase through College
buildings. A member of the
Diplomatic Protection Squad
detained and charged the man on
Queen's Gate after he was
'restrained' by College security
staff.
The arrest followed a spate of
thefts comprising of purses, wallets,
chequebooks and chequecards.
Witnesses have told Felix that the
man was seen on three separate
occasions leaving rooms from
which property was later reported
as having been stolen. Despite the
circulation of a description of the
suspect, he evaded College security
officers on these occasions.
The man was spotted by a
member of College staff just after
6pm on 17 March. Security was
immediately alerted, and College
security officers on the scene gave
chase. The pursuit led through the
Huxley Building, resulting in
damage to one of the doors. The
chase ended on Queen's Gate,
where the man was restrained by
several security officers. A member
of the Diplomatic Protection Squad,
who was passing on a motorcycle,
was flagged down to give
assistance. The man was detained
in the security lodge in the Huxley
Building. He was taken to
Rochester Row police station, and
was released on bail. The man faces
charges of criminal damage, and
Police investigations are continuing
into possible theft charges.
