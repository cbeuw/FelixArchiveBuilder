Rowing Results
On Saturday 13th March, four
Imperial College Crews took part
in the 1993 Kingston head of the
river race. The two novice men
VIIIs gave brilliant performances,
with the first crew winning the
novice class and earning a shiny
new trophy for the boat club
mantelpiece. The second crew had
a slight weight disadvantage, but
this did not stop them from
completing the course quickly and
in style. The women members of
the boat club have had to fight hard
for recognition, but, last weekend,
eighteen months of intense training
paid off with two excellent results.
The Senior 3 IV had their work cut
out in a tough group, but they
rowed well and achieved an
admirable second, with a time that
actually beat the winners of the
senior open class. The novice
women, were more fortunate and
stormed to victory in the novice
class winning with an excellent
time. The women's crews now plan
to split into IV's to prepare for the
summer regatta season. With the
fine performances exhibited this
weekend, both the girls and novice
men are well on course for a good
result at Henley later this year.
Dribblers Round Up
The Dribblers have had a busy year.
Along with lots of social events
we've been playing matches most
weekends.
Last term we played our first
international against a Canadian and
this term have been on tour to
Sheffield. The Dribblers seem to
have lost a lot of matches but we've
also won quite a few and as a result
have managed to come third in the
London Colleges League and reach
the semi-finals of the London
Colleges indoor tournament.
We're a team of very talented
players and can only go from
strength to strength. Our record of
never losing a boat race still stands
and probably will for the
foreseeable future.

Skittles
The college scratch singles recentiy
ended with a win for 'rubbish skip'
Sharpe after a tight final. The final
group consisted of Richard Waring,
Sam Chen, Phil West and Pete
Sharpe. The first match produced
comfortable victories for Pete and
Phil. Sam Chen finally moved into
gear for the second game, defeating
Phil West 178-149. Pete picked up
his second win by sparing the
10-pin in the 10th 160-156. The
scores meant that the winner would
be the victor in the Pete Sharpe v
Phil West game, unless Sam Chen
could pull out a remarkable 3rd
game. Sam Chen completed ?
victory of Richard Waring but h.
score of 156 was insufficient to
challenge either Pete or Phil for 1st
place. Pete Sharpe saved his best
game for last defeating Phil
(Bottler) West 210-181.
Final placings were: 1) Pete
Sharpe 11.35 points, 2) Sam Chen
8.67 points, 3) Phil West 7.22
points, 4) Richard Wearing 4.40
points.
High average for the tournament
was 177 by Pete Sharpe, followed
by Sam Chen 167.
Shotokan Karate
IC-Shotokan Karate Club sent a
team of 7 students and former
students to the Southern Region
competition held in Reading on
February 20th. This competition is
one of the main events in southern
England and so the team went with
high hopes even though some of the
strongest members of IC Shotokan
Karate, like Paul Potter (2nd
Dan—PhD student in
Biotechnology) were missing.
Dr Robert Newton (2nd Dan and
known for 'bobbing' people) and
Maziar Kakhi (2nd Dan) were the
most experienced members of the
team and both won fights for the
squad.
Robin Soole (Computing), Simon
Petrovich (ex IC) and Chris
Brockwell had their first appearance
in a major competition. Even
though they were all out after the
second round, they came back with
unbroken spirit and will probably
form the core of IC Shotokans
future Kumite squad.
If you are interested in seeing the
boys (and girls!!) in action or want
to try it out yourself—why not come
along to one of our ttaining sessions
(Mon 19.30-22.00; Thu
19.00-21.30; Sat 10.00-12.00).
You can also contact Uta Boltze (IC
Shotokan Club Secretary), ext
