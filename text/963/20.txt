O b s e s s i o n s
An alcoholic German doctor has
been visited by a beautiful, arrogant
European woman who strode into
his jungle outpost, demanding help
(guess what). That's how his
passionate obsessions started.
Doctor (Rob Inglis) is revealing us
his story in this one man play
adapted from Stefan Zweig's
'Amok'.
The action revolves between the
ship's deck, a medical outpost in the
Javanese Jungle Government house
and sleazy downtown Djakarta.
Everywhere 'that sultry, oppressive
atmosphere that plays on your
nerves like a thunderstorm till they
snap—and you run amok'. By the
way, amok (from Malay) means a
rush in frenzy. Totally blinded with
his passionate obsession, the doctor
is ready to sacrifice everything, his
career, his doctor's licence and life
to save her secret.
Although Rob Inglis (who also
adapted this play) managed quite
successfully to carry out dialogues
with invisible persons and to move
from one situation/place to another,
somehow he failed to express all
those passionate obsessons, which
was what the story was about. He
performed and looked very tired.
This tiredness was somewhere
between an acting tired and
emotionally exhausted person and
a really tired actor performing late
at night (the play starts at 9.30pm)
in front of a half empty audience.
If you do go to the Sunday
Market in Camden and if you can
kill time there until 9.30pm (maybe,
a couple of drinks in the Oxford
Arms, where the Etcetera is) why
not, go and see this play since you
are there already. Otherwise don't
bother.

T h e T h r e e Sisters
Tempted with a last minute ticket
I found myself seated before The
Three Sisters. Perhaps I must
therefore claim part of the
responsibility for the dismal
response Rose Bruford's group
managed to evoke in me. I tried, I
really tried. Alas, their efforts were
fruidess. This production was very,
very dull.
Obsessions.
It was also very, very long—and
yet the characterisation remained
largely undeveloped. The
'thumbnail sketches' of chracters
never became credible. The two
servant characters of confused
regional origin (you can't beat a
Geordie/West Country accent and
a limp to instantly create someone
stupid and harmless) were of source
of particular dissatisfaction.
Ironically, they were also the
sources of greatest amusement. The
simple roles and straightforward
exchanges were handled best.
Perhaps Chekov was a mistake.
Elaine Pyke handled the part of
Maria fairly well, although she
herself looked bored at times.
(Understandable in the company.)
How she could find anything more
interesting in Jershin than in
Kulygin did not become apparent—
in fact the male cast seemed to be
the unfortunate sufferers of
'Charisma Lobotomies' all-round.
I did spy a cast member yawning
at one point, but I won't tell who.
Disbelief, therefore, hung thick
in the air—while onstage each
member of the cast launched his/her
piece of dialogue to minimal
response from the others (—the
sound of castaway lines thudding on
the floor was practically audible
throughout the performance). Still,
we ploughed along, with the
volume of speech at a constant
'forte', varying to brief 'mezzo
forte' in moments of extreme
poignancy. The lack of aural
sensitivity was not aided by the
staging, which placed the dinner
table inthe wings of the theatre,
leaving the actors barely visible and
screaming over to a distant and
yawning audience.
Enduring memories—Maria's
fate was indeed a poor one, of all
the three sisters she at least did
deserve better—perhaps one day
she'll get to Moscow. I'm afraid I
don't know if she got there or not—
after the longest and most inept
piece of scene changing I have yet
seen I'm afraid I sloped off home
to catch Northern Exposure.
The 'not able features' award for
this evening goes resoundingly to
the noses of all cast members,
which had more character and
interest in them than anything else
on stage. Fabulous hooters, shame
about the production.

Alfie
Alfie is a play about a London based
Don Juan and his incredible love
life. Well, you would think it is
after seeing the first ten minutes of
the play, but as the story unfolds a
deeper message seems to emerge.
From scene to scene, and from love
to love we are confronted with
situations which are quite
unexpected in that their serious, and
sometimes sad atmosphere clashes
with Alfie's happy-go-lucky
personality. Using these scenes, an
honest attempt is made, to unveil
certain murkier sides of the
relationship between the sexes. It is
this insightful text, as well as Alfie's
incisive monologues which gives
the play its power.
Alfie often talks directly to the
audience and tries to induce in them
a judgement of his character, as
well as a general sentiment towards
him. This is vital since the audience
must witness his tribulations as if
they were happening to a
acquaintance or a friend. Adam
Faith achieves this admirably and
thanks to him the full potential of
the text is brought forth. This rare
combination of great acting and a
great script make this play a must
for any theatre lover.
