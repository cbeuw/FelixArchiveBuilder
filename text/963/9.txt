Ten past six on a bright sunny
Saturday morning, what a glorious
day to act like a bird. An uneventful
trip into college for 7.45 to meet up
with fellow skydivers and
parachutists, an uneasy, pensive
sense of excitement lingers over the
26 jumpers who depart their destiny
at Hinton in the Hedges airfield.
At last the airfield, well at least
on sight, we seem to stalk the
airfield in ever decreasing cirlces,
was this a sign, no, just another
right turn. At last an entrance, and
what an entrance, the wrong one
straight onto the runway. On finally
sorting out where we were
supposed to be, the party splits up
with the 23 parachutists departing
to the local village hall to complete
their training and the four tandem
skydivers to commence their
training. Being one of the tandem
skydivers I was trained thus, meet
Larse your strap-on instructor, this
is the harness which attaches your
back to my chest, when the plane
is at 9,000 feet you will sit on my
lap 'but I hardly know you', I will
tighten the harness after the other
three skydivers have departed the
plane at 9,500 feet we will shuffle
to the exit, you will sit on the edge,
your thumbs in your shoulder
straps, knees together, legs bent
under the plane, head up and away
we go, then you immediately arch
your back, keep your knees together
with your legs bent, back as far as
possible, training finished.
The first two tandem skydivers
jumped, Rupert first looking a bit
white and worse for wear
afterwards and having been out on
the town the night before didn't help
'was it really a sickening
experience?'. John followed and on
landing was on a bit of a buzz 'well
is it better than sex?!!'.
At last my destiny arrives, I get
kitted up with my flying suit,
harness, helmet and goggles.
Biggies eat your heart out.
Meanwhile the intensively trained
parachutists return to be greeted
with the news that the ground wind
speed is greater than ten knots so
no jumps could take place until it
dropped below. This fortunately did
not apply to me.
I approached the plane with
mixed feelings of eager
apprehensive anticipation. Five
skydivers, squeezing into the small
interior, the plane was a bit ropey
with various pieces of tape, holding
things together thank goodness I
had a parachute on. We taxied
down the runway turned and away
we climbed, I was sitting on the
floor next to where the door should
have been, but instead this was the
open jumping space. During the
climb the other skydivers indicated
the increasing height, the fields
below formed a patchwork quilt of
greens, browns and yellows, so
soon just over 5,000 feet, the mile
high club, well not quite. The first
sky diver departed: he was doing a
low altitude dive he disappeared
rapidly, ('gulp!') my heart beat
increased yet again and what is this
hollow feeling inside 'why am I
here and what am I doing?'. Nine
thousand feet onto my instructor's
lap, 9,500 feet where did the other
two skydivers go; Who's next? I
shuffle to the door, what was it? ah
thumbs in shoulder straps, knees
together, legs bent under the plane,
look up, just a quick look down
wasn't a good idea it was a long
way. I look up, heart racing,
savouring the fear and enjoyment
too late to back out, and away.
What a sensation: no sense of
falling, no sense of speed although
it is 120mph plus, the wind roaring
in my ears, ripping at the flying
suit, trying to tear off my goggles,
time for aerial acrobatics. A 360°
to the right then the left with swift
sharp execution, how long have we
been falling, what's our height, will
the parachute open, enjoy and
savour the moment. A tremendous
jerk and an upward movement the
canopy is open, no more fear just
an adrenalin high now the glide
down, spiralling, turning and
hovering, the view and sensation
are fantastic, no, here comes
reality: a perfect stalled upright
landing, but me well I am still
flying...It would be so easy to
become a skydive junky living for
that adrenalin rush and pushing
yourself to the limit with radical
manoevres.
Meanwhile back on the ground
the wind speed finally dropped
below 10 knots but the light was
fading all too fast which meant only
6 parachutists actually left the
ground and experienced their own
2,000 feet jumps conquering their
fears and apprehensions getting a
buzz of a lifetime.
The light or lack of it prevented
the rest of the party jumping, and
the last tandem skydiver Charles
too. This means a return visit for
those frustrated who live life to the
full. Don't be frustrated and
remember if you don't return
Mulitple Sclerosis sufferers will
remain frustrated. Give everyone a
buzz and succeed—that's what life's
about!
