Felix 963 24 March 1993
Bar conspiracy
Dear Jonty,
Linstead Hall Bar
I would like to correct the false
impression given by your article
under this heading, in last week's
issue of Felix.
The Linstead Hall Bar was not
closed by the Catering Manager,
Simon Westerman, but by myself.
Simon Westerman happened to be
on holiday at the time.
There is no conspiracy to close
the Hall bars but there is a
determination on the part of the
College to ensure that all bars run
strictly in accordance with the
Islam weekly
Dear Jonty, Editor Islam Weekly
Have you ever been on holiday
and had some irritating bastards
pester you all week trying to sell
you timeshare holidays? Have you
ever been on a degree course and
requirements of the licensing
authorities and college regulations.
As your article pointed out, there
was a reported error in the bar's
accounts and this necessitated a
temporary closure, so that the
matter could be properly
investigated. The fact that the error
did not prove in the end to be as
serious as it first appeared to be,
does not mean that the decision to
close temporarily was wrong or
inappropriate.
Yours sincerely,
Angus Fraser.
had some irritating bastards pester
you for three years trying to sell you
the ideal of Islam.
Name withheld to avoid annoying
bastards pestering me for the rest
of my sentence.
Crocky's view
Dear Jonty,
I was pleased by the calm tone of
the reaction to the-Beit Back on
Islam in Felix 960.
Since we seem to have non-
fanatic muslims ready to discuss
things maybe they could make it
clear how the Islamic 'way of life'
regards women (declared inferior to
man by the Koran), the Jewish
people and their religion (Angel
Gabriel was first spoken of by the
Jews—this does not give him a
'nationality' but an 'origin'!), or
atheists and polytheists. Could they
also explain the concept of Jihad,
which it seems 'technically' cannot
be called for beyond certain
Middle-Eastern borders, and
explain to what extent the Koran
allows humans to administer Justice
(including killing people or putting
a price on their head) in the place
of God, whom it would seem is old
enough to defend himself and will
have the last word anyway. (This
last point can be made to Christians
dogmatically protecting Jesus
against blasphemy).
Believe me, I have an interest in
the ways of Islam, but also great
concern as to how it is understood
by those who follow it.
Islam does have a history of non-
peaceful conversion, though
possibly not half as bloody as that
of Christianity. Muslim-majority
countries also have a history of
common wars (Iran, Iraq, Syria,
Egypt, parts of Lebanon and North
Africa...) and please, we a// know
that Muslims, like countless other
groups, have been kicked around
and still get thrashed nowadays—
this is in no way a private privilege,
nor a reason to present them as
passive victimised angels.
Please try to answer these
questions with as little dogma as
possible that means without
attributing too many desires and
actions to God, about whom you'll
disagree forever with millions of
other believers who all think they
follow the Final Message, the Real
Way or whatever else.
Yours expectantly, Mr Crocky.
and shake my head. 'Hmmm,' he
replies,'I've seen a few people fall
down with those on their backs I can
tell you.' He begins to list all the
equipment he would carry with him
in the field, fighting so that I'd be
able to live in a country where
people like him are free to walk the
streets. 'Oh yes, and Billy we never
saw him again, after Lyons'. Then
he looks at me and I know whats
coming. Good grief, we're only
seconds away from Clapham
Junction. 'Billy? Billy? It cant be
you can it?' Damn right it can't.
'You've grown your hair you old
dandy but...' I run.
The bus. I'm upstairs on my final
leg. If you ever need to find a
madman look to the top left seat of
a London double decker. A portly
old black gentleman begins tapping
his feet and miming a harmonica
solo, then launches into a heart
breaking drunk rendition of 'Season
of the Blues'. And I'm thinking of
the government which has
abandonded these people on the
streets, to take their own lonely
roads, all of which lead to London.
'Care in the Community'! It has the
same ring as 'Barmiztvah in a pork
shop'. While I'm wondering who's
really mad, John Lee Hooker the
Second stamps his foot and wails
'Now it's the Season - uh uh yeah
- for the Blues'. Too right.
A Slice of Life
Owain Benna/IacJc
It took Odysseus ten years to get
back from Troy. The man didn't
know his own luck. A few wailing
witches and a one eyed sheep herder
and suddenly half his ships are
bubbling under the Adriatic. Now
if those hardy Greeks had the
misfortune to require the use of
public transport en route -
disembarking at Ithaca special
wheelchair ramps and
Zimmerframes would have been
called for, before the brave but
geriatric sailors returned to their old
castle. There Odysseus finds his
wife, not on the point of being wed
to another, but fumbling over the
bathroom sink, simultaneously
adjusting her dentures and
examining her great great grand
daughter for head lice. And I'm
assuming he wasn't travelling at
autumn, with leaves on the line
delaying his journey until the
coming of the Roman Empire.
I know I should be tolerant but
it's just I would so much rather
meet a disgruntied Minatour, travel
card in cloven hand, at Gloucester
Road tube station than the loonies
I bump into. They scare me.
Wednesday was simply a
rollercoaster ride through human
instability. Just getting home, a
forty five minute journey, brought
me into contact with most of the
rejects from 'One flew over the
Cuckoo's nest'.
They were mainly harmless mind
you. Well, excepting Damien.
Damien is the name we shall give
to the young gentleman who sat
next to me on boarding the Circle
Line train. Damien wore black.
Only black. Fine, so do I
sometimes. His arms were exposed.
They looked like he'd decided green
was not an appropriate skin colour
and had clumsily attempted to paint
over them with a thin coat of Dulux
'Snow White'. The result was a less
well known shade - Dulux 'Walking
Dead'. He had 'tatooed' (they
looked more like machete scars...)
on each forarm some rather natty
upturned Crucifix's. On his coat
was a badge with 'Charles Manson'
emblazened across it, the names of
his victims written beneath. At
Victoria I got ready to leave.
Damien turned to face me, head
vibrating with the headphoned
Death Thrash he was pumping into
it, and gave a long low moan that
reminded me that one day I was
going to die, and Damien would
probably rather like to be present.
Okay so I survive, and make it to
platform nine. Enter stage left an
old Asian woman, carrying an
empty picture frame. Now Damien
wasn't mad, his parents had just let
him watch driller killer at too tender
an age. As the lady placed the
picture frame to my face, nodded
thoughtfully and then howled into
the air before shuffling off to repeat
the trick I mused about whether it
was possible to somehow sense a
video nasty through the walls of the
womb. She was completly out of it.
And not one of the commuters was
in the slighest bit perturbed.
So I'm sitting at the back of the
carriage, trying to think of any evil
deeds I'd done that morning, and
half expecting Jeremy Beadle to
turn and give me his devilish grin.
An old chap comes and sits next to
me. He seems normal enough and
the train trundles out of Victoria.
It's over the Thames that he reveals
his true and half expected colours.
Spying the coarse hessian rucksack
I carry he says 'Ah, now that's an
old para issue isn't it?' I think it's
a copy, but I'm not sure so I nod
