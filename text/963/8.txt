Flashback
At the end of a second term of
highly successful ragging, let's take
a brief look back at the events that
made the current total the highest
ever - £60,000.
It all began with a handful of
eager Raggies setting off for Rag
Conference, in Manchester, even
before term began. Three days, and
a lot of beer, later they returned,
full of ideas and all clued up, keen
to make Rag even bigger and better.
Term began, and just a few short
weeks into term, so did Rag Week.
Complete with the inevitable and
unmissable Hit Squad, and even
those (dare I mention them)
controversial Frontal lobotomy-o-
grams, plus a whole host of crazy
events, including the annual Dirty
Disco, Slave Auction (yep, I bet
most of the slaves, like myself, still
haven't paid their debts!), and the
Beer Festival. What more could you
possibly desire?!
A little further into term, Chris
Davidson was cruelly murdered,
sparking off a Londonwide search
for the culprits of this horrendous
crime. Teams even managed to
collect a little loose change as they
Coming up over Easter we have a
whole load of thrilling collections,
all listed below for your
convenience. If you know you'll be
around for any of these and fancy
lending a hand to shake a can, pop
over to the Rag Office (no longer
a Rag Orifice, it's been tidied
recently!) and find the appropriate
list. Names have already been taken
at last Friday's meeting, but there
are still places left, so don't delay.
March
23rd Crystal Palace v Liverpool
24th QPR v Blackburn Rovers.
30th/31st Jesus Jones, Oxfam
collection.
A quick thanks go to Thresher
(Gloucester Road branch) for
providing the prize for the Dirty
Dozen winning team - Falmouth
Keogh, for those of you that have
chased the killer.
Throughout all this, the regular
concert and football match
collections, that have become so
much a part of this year's Rag, have
been continuing, allowing anyone
interested free entrance to Simply
Red, B-52s, and many more... All
in all, a pretty good term, with
another one promising to follow
close on it's heels. What do we have
lined up for next term? Well,
knowing that this is traditionally the
time of year when everyone
suddenly remembers that they are
supposed to be doing a degree, and
that if they want to remain at
Imperial another year they need to
pass this one first, Rag will be
taking everything easy, as it were.
The main event of tenn will be Rag
Fete on May 12th, where at least 22
charities, plus various clubs and
societies, will be running silly stalls
such as a laser shoot, balloon race,
gunge wrestling, and lots more. If
you are a member of a club that
might like to participate in this
event, contact Lorna or Rach in the
Rag Office soonish.

forgotten already. No prizes for
guessing that what Thresher kindly
donated was something to do with
alcohol - two crates of something-
to-do-with-alcohol, to be exact!
On Saturday 13th March, as
twenty-odd nervous people
prepared to jump out of a perfectly
good plane in another part of the
country, a handful of collectors set
off for the wilds of Bristol on the
second most daring expedition ever
attempted by Rag. Accompanied by
a man-, nay, collector-sized, panda
suit and a hedgehog named
Tim'rous, they proceeded to con the
people of Bristol out of a grand total
of £50, and even managed to have
a good time whilst doing so. Well,
doesn't that prove something? The
total may not be huge, but speak to
any of the collectors involved and
At the beginning of next term, at an
E G M , Rag will be electing next
year's Chair. Normally, this would
have already been done, but as
nobody stood for the job it couldn't
be done. If you are interested
enough in Rag to consider this, then
you will already know about all
this, and don't need telling anyway!
Other Rag posts, such as Internal
Affairs Officer (the poor little hard-
working person that laboriously
slaves away at the minutes every
you will find that they all had a
brilliant time - possibly something
to do with the panda snorting coke
in MacDonald's?! (There is actually
an explanation for this strange
behaviour - apparently the panda
suit has no mouth, so a certain
Jaymz Handley was forced to drink
coke, via a straw, through the
nostril...!). Thanks to a lovely
sunny day, and a very friendly
bunch of Raggies from Exeter, the
fact that both Bath and Bristol Rags
were as hard to find as the Red
Tomato on QT was incidental to the
enjoyment of the day, so I am
reliably informed.

responsible for wittering away a

ie me), Sponsored Events Officer,
Hall Rep Coordinator and lots
more, will be elected at the A G M
on 7th May. If you think you may
be interested in any one of these
posts, grab this year's officer and
get them to give you the lowdown
on the job. If you're STILL
interested - see you at the elections.
Praying for the wind to change at the parachute jump.
