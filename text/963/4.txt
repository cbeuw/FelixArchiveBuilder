Views of a moderate man

Dear Jonty,
In an attempt to draw a line
beneath the correspondence with the
Islamic Society, we would like to
make the point that our letter (Felix
958) was simply a reply to their
request (a seemingly annual
occurrence) for a public debate-
read 'riot'—about the government's
foreign policy towards the Middle
East, and the application of Islam
as a solution to its problems. We
understand that a previous such
debate, at which we were not
present, degenerated into a heated
public slanging match. Given the
likelihood of our being grossly
outnumbered, we are not inclined
to accept their challenge.
We would like to make it clear
that we do not have any objections
to those who practice Islam. Indeed
we would broadly support a 'free
market' in religion, it being purely
a matter of personal preference.
Greek uproar
However, the attempts by some
of the more fundamentalist types to
outline the alleged benefits of their
undemocratic integrated political,
economic and judicial system by
slating our own democracy and
indigenous religious institutions, are
also offensive.
We cannot help commenting on
Abdullah's observation (Felix 959)
that there are only 95,000
millionaires in Britain. This dire
situation will be improved now that
Littlewoods has increased a 1-1
score draw to 3 points, thus
improving the individual's chance
of winning the £2 million jackpot!

Gentlemen,
As the author of the Hellenic
Society's article, I feel compelled
to respond to the Turkish Society's
letter of the last issue.
The Turks are right in saying that
no one would believe their
propaganda: every nation has the
credibility it deserves, and Turkey,
from being the 'Sick Man of
Europe' in the 19th century to being
the Kurds', Armenians' and Greek
Cypriots' oppressor, as well as the
West's poor cousin, today has made
no progress.
Another reason no one believes
this propaganda is that a superficial
knowledge of the history of the area
is sufficient to demonstarte its gross
inaccuracy: Greece did not invade
Turkey in the 1920s: Turkey had
fought with the Germans in the First
World War and Greece, being on
the victor's side, was awarded part
of the frontier territories which,
apart from being historically Greek,
were home to a prosperous Greek
community which had been
massacred during the War (900,000
civilians executed). When the
Greek authorities came to invest in
the area, they were met by
rebellious Turks: The Greeks,
unprepared for war, lost, and the
Turks, not completely satisfied,
proceeded to new massacres of the
civilian members of the long-

Dear Jonty,
RE: Mediterranean Conflict
Article
Reading your Felix Issue of the
12th of March 1993,1 came to the
article by Ersin Akartuna, titled
'Mediterranean Conflict' and to be
honest to you I was totally
dumb-founded.
In this article Akartuna made
accusations that in the international
night special issue she had found
two articles, which she found
offending (as I understood her
arguments), and also that they were
written by 'Greek fanatics' and
furthermore that any 'real' Greek
person would not have been as
fanatic as the Hellenic society
members.
May I briefly say at this point that
I personally, am not a member of
the Hellenic society here at College,
and also that I consider an insult to
my person to be called a Greek,
since I am a Hellen, from Hellas as
my ancestors called (and is still
being called) our country.
Therefore, I do consider myself a
'real' Hellen, but certainly not a
Greek. If you are puzzled I do
sympathise, but please refer to the
Turkish history to see the origins of
the word Greek.
Coming back to Ersin Akartuna's
article, my curiosity was exceeding
my resentment for such insults and
also I tried to see the reasoning that
followed. Hence my thinking too
the following 'paths' of reasoning:
In the Hellenic religion, Jesus
Christ declares that no man should
answer violence back with violence
yet if I am not mistaken, the Koran,
every unbeliever of the Moslem
faith should be treated with the
sword and total annihOation. Then
I remembered an incident two years
ago in Istanbul, where a whole
tourist bus of Hellens visiting the
city, was put on fire by a Turkish
fanatic, and 32 people, including
two children were burned to death
since they could not escape from the
bus.
Finally I also rememered all these
U N accusations about the Turkish
established Greek community (tens
of thousands killed; 1,300,000
deported—date given by French
historian Castellan).
As for Cyprus, the Treaty of
Guarantee allowed a punctual
intervention, upon the condition of
both Greece's and Britain's
agreement, for the uphold of the
Constitutional order. Not only the
Constitutional order had not been
broken to justify an intervention,
but the Turks, by their invasion and
occupation of 40% of the Cypriot
territory from 1974 to this day
(which differs from an
'intervention' in a big way),
destroyed Constitutional order
permanently. Also, nothing at all
can justify the killing of 4,500
Greek Cypriot civilians and the
uprooting of a further 200,000
(fully documented by the U N ,
Amnesty International and other
human rights monitoring groups, in
contrast the the Turkish claims of
'Greek massacres'). How about
today, after 19 years of occupation?
Are you still re-establishing the
Constitutional order (in contempt
for the U N Resolutions which
condemn you)?
Yours faithfully,

PhD, on behalf of the Hellenic
Society.
Barry's funeral was attended by
many of his friends and colleagues
from Imperial. Tributes came from
both academic and administrative
staff, apprentices and students.
Graham, Lesley, Robert and I feel
very proud of Barry's contribution
to education at Imperial College.
army attacking constantly the
Kurdish tribes in their territory, and
massacreing Kurdic villages.
All the above, as you understand,
came in strong contrast to the above
named article, especially since I
have never heard, seen hints of such
behaviour in my country. And then
in the midst of all this puzzlement,
I finally grasped the point of the
article!
Ersin Akartuna's article was a try
for jest! Thus relieved, please
convey my best wishes to Ersin
Akartuna, for she has actually lifted
up my mood considerably today.
Yours sincerely,
Georgia Sigala (PG 1).
