Easter Ents
Friday night sees the end of a long
term of college. To celebrate and
laugh off the nightmares, we've
arranged a special comedy
spectacular. Three top comedians,
who've been the recipients of many
prestigious awards are appearing in
the Union Lounge.
The main act, Harry Hill,
recendy won the Perrier Award for
the Best Newcomer 1992. He's
appeared on all manner of comedy
shows and is generally regarded to
be the next 'Vic Reeves'. His act
at the Edinburgh Festival last year
was a huge sell-out and he's been
described as 'The Future of
Comedy'. The compere for the
night will be Boothby Grafoe.
Having compered in many London
Clubs, last year he was the compere
of the Glastonbury Festival,
performing in front of as many as
4,000 people. He recently won a
Time Out Comedy Award for his
achievements and who am I to
argue with that.
The support act for the evening
is Dave Thompson, a stand-up who
has played all the top comedy clubs
on die circuit. So, for a bill which
would normally cost about £7, all
we're looking for from you today
is £2. What a bargain! All this and
a late bar 'til 2am, disco 'til 3am,
Smile Zone Happy Hour (8.30pm-
10.00pm, all drinks reduced by
20%). Need I say more? Yes!
Tickets are very limited. An end of
term event is likely to sell out in
advance. Don't be disappointed!
Buy your ticket now from the Union
Office.

P.S. Doors open 8pm. Acts on
stage 9pm. Bring student ID.

Silwood
Unless you study Biology or happen
to be related to Scott of the
Antarctic it is unlikely that you have
found your way out to Silwood
Park. Situated in deepest darkest
Berkshire, two miles from Ascot
racecourse, Silwood is a field
station of Imperial College and is
home for between 100 and 200
postgraduate students.
Recently the dearth of
communication between Silwood
and the main campus was addressed
by an 'Outreach Day'. The
President Chris Davidson, Student
Adviser Stefano Ruis and a
permanent member of Union staff
Michelle, spent the day at Silwood
talking to residents. During this
time the particular problems of
Silwood students were addressed
and a plan of action devised. The
Outreach Day was a great success
and plans are afoot for repeats.
It is easy when living at Silwood
Park to feel that you are not a part
of Imperial College Union and
events such as these help overcome
this.
Unfortunately, the behaviour of
candidates for the recent elections
did not act in the same way. You
might have noticed that the
'favourite candidate' for Silwood
residents was New Election. This
is not because we have no interest
in the elections, quite the reverse;
it was in response to the interest
shown by the candidates, in a word
nil. Not only did they not bother to
visit, providing the opportunity for
hustings, but we also failed to
receive any posters or flyers. Any
candidate who had bothered to visit
would almost certainly have assured
themselves upwards of fifty votes;
prospective officials take note.
However, with the Outreach Day
I hope we have reached a watershed
in terms of communication between
South Kensington and Silwood.
Systems have been established
which will allow Silwood students
to interact with clubs and societies
at S. K e n more easily.
Furthermore, I would remind you
that you can make use of the
facilities here at Silwood.
Admittedly we do not have the
range of c&s, however, if you fancy
a day out in the country at the
weekend why not come and explore
the 250ha. of Silwood Park, or find
out what postgraduate life is really
like by visiting the bar during the
week.
What I am trying to say is
Silwood is more than a page in the
prospectus, it is a community and
a part of Imperial College with
which you may interact.
