Airhead have reinvented
themselves. They regrouped as a
cross between Suede and Nirvana,
changing themselves, dropping the
bagginess quicker than a
Soupdragon dropping a hot potato
and leek. And they've lost a
member. One down, three to go.
But in all of this they've retained
one vital recognisable
characteristic. They're still crap.
Thousand Yard Stare, on the
other hand, have not mutated.
Thousand Yard Stare run through
pretty much the same set we'd seen
a couple of weeks previous at the
Blue A e r o p l a n e s , Kingmaker
- U L U , Friday
At last, I deem myself worthy of
passing the pearly gates into the true
inner sanctum of Felixdom. (I do
the deeming around here, matey -
M.Ed.) I have followed the three
rules of any hack attending a show:
stand at the back and don't smile,
don't clap at the end of a tune and
turn up late to all shows or leave
early. Then you're hard, cool and
have earned your press pass.
Respect.
So here I am, long bwack coat,
sipping me brown, having missed
the first band and arrived half way
through the Kingmaker set. Excuses
all round, my wisdom tooth was
giving mo teething pain. Heh, this
is 1993 and life is great, just like
Frosties. Digression, the essence of
Chaucer.
Three men on an empty stage,
something was missing, just what
was it. Robert Mitchum smiles at
the great pretender. Loz sings about
real things that affect everybody and
the indie bop kids nick his beer and
jump off the stage. Bloody kids. I
was in 'Nam me, '69. I heard
'When Lucy's Down' but the rest
was new material. Most of it was
typical pop riffs that don't inspire
me to write anything.
The Blue Aeroplanes, by
contrast, were remarkably good.
oT Camden Palace. 'No score, after
extra time' opens, with assorted
other gems from 'Hands On', and
a few new numbers thrown in for
good measure. Thousand Yard
Stare are about a thousand times
better than Airhead.
Voice Of The Beehive. So good
I can't think of anything to say. I
was suitably sweaty afterwards,
which is always a good evaluation
of the grooviness quotient of a good
gig. Voice Of The Beehive are even
better than Thousand Yard Stare.

• Thousand Yard Stare's
collection of early material, 'Fair
To Middling' is out now on Stifled
Aardvark/Polydor.
The set starts with the band hidden
behind a polythene sheet upon
which their shadows are projected
through a wall of smoke. This
curtain is promptly pulled down
after an older crowd have
recognised the song. Then we're
away. There are four guitarists- the
entire band family and roadcrew
must have been hired. At one point
the drummer plays guitar. There is
also a dancer. Oh no I think,
another Bez, Boz, Baz twat. Yet I
am wrong, the dancer is a great
addition to the set.
The Blue Aeroplanes are a great
live act. Their originality is
outstanding. They break all the
rules, write decent songs, employ
the bouncer as guitarist, throw
flowers at the audience, and totally
enthral the audience. For their first
song of the set, the female member
plays and sings a solo ballad tided
'Separated'. She introduces it as the
song the rest of the band wanted her
to play as she was the only female
in the group. Totally unprepared for
this, she apologises for her first
mistake and starts again. Total
showmanship. This band were
great, buy their albums, sing their
praises but most important of all, go
see them.

dc Basehead is angry, black and
sexually aggressive. He wants us to
know that. The language 'n' attitude
in 'Not in Kansas Anymore'
expresses this in strong terms.
But despite the lyrics the music
is mostly mellow; the basslines are
melodic and make you sway rather
than freak out—some of the toons

It doesn't sound like Jesus Jones,
that's my problem with this. Jesus
Jones sound like 'The Devil You
Know', like 'Never Enough', like
'Who? Where? Why?'. Jesus Jones
sound like techno with loud guitars,
Jesus Jones sound like pop tunes,
and this doesn't sound like Jesus
Jones. That's my problem with this.

Fashion Crisis Hits N e w York
As soon as 'After All' hit the charts
at the beginning of the year, anyone
who didn't predict a re-release of
early material should have been
dismissed as blind and stupid. So
here's the first, the previously
deleted EP2, in all its glory on the
second of an oh-so commercial two-
cd pack. The first contains a re-
recording of 'Fashion Crisis...' and
a live version of 'Time', and
assorted other tracks dragged from
the past, which you, as an astute
reader of our reviews, have already
bought, correct?
(For those of you who foolishly
ignored our recommendations,
'Fashion Crisis...' is probably The
Frank & Walters best single,
excepting 'After A l l ' , a pristine
blast of nonsense which takes at
least two weeks of constant listening
to decipher.)
Told you so.

• Out on Go! Discs, April 5.
are so laid back they're horizontal.
'I need a joint' is sweet jazz/soul to
make you weep—here and
elsewhere the sounds almost negate
the strong words.
I couldn't believe the difference
between the sound and the
sentiment. It's mellow, thought-
provoking stuff. As a dance record
there is much to dance to, it's music
to think with—not to rave with. The
instructions say that after you've
listened to the words for a couple
of playings then 'pump up the bass
and volume and rock this shit'—It
doesn't fit...

A creepin' from the looming forest
come the 10,000 Maniacs,
clutching singles from their latest
LP 'Our Time in Eden'. A jaunty
affair this after the shiny doom of
their previous stuff. Which is not to
say that 'Candy Everybody Wants'
is your usual easy stocking filler.
Rather it floats on either a crackling
tune and the general all-round
excellence of leader Natalie
Merchant.
The other single tracks give
glimpses of their other sides. The
literately tipping of hat in 'Jack
Kerouac' and homely portrait of
'My Sister Rose' are as good a
range as you can hope to get of the
world according to Maniacs. A fine
place to pass the day, believe me.

J o h n s o n — T u r n M e O n
Five remixes that are surprisingly
different enough deserve to be on
the same CD. Only the 7" 'Edit' is
a bit bollocks, but I normally find
7" isn't enough to 'turn me on'.
All the other tracks are pretty
funky. Thumping bass and sweet
singing, perhaps what would be
described today as 'New Power
Soul', or just good old Soul II Soul
style. The tune is definitely
reminiscent of Soul II Soul,
especially track four—'Primetime
Mix', which sounds like Soul 27
Soul on a New Jack Swing trip.
The nicest track is track five
'M21 Mix', it's a bit more 'chill'
and a bit adventurous. She does get
turned on right at the end if you
know what I mean. OK this isn't
especially original but the sound of
her sparking up right at the end is
a nice touch.
If you're into this kind of music,
buy it. Sounds good in the sunshine.
Wish.
