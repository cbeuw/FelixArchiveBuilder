James R Hoffa as most of you may
not know was one of the most
important figures to come out of the
American labour movement in the
thirties. He shaped the history of the
nation's most powerful labour
union, the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters. This
epic film follows the career of the
aforementioned figure over four
decadesâ€”from his passionate
struggle for power to his final
enigmatic fall.
The great man himself is played
by Jack Nicholson, so effectively in
fact that you soon forget about the
Few Good Men and the Jokers and
watch, mesmerised as Nicholson
'becomes' Hoffa in what is surely
his greatest acting moment.
Supported by such distinguished
names as Danny DeVito (who also
directs) and Armand Assaute (to
name but two) this film has no
trouble persuading Joe Public that
it means business.
Everything revolves around an
anonymous diner, standing alone on
a highway, somewhere in modern
America, and through the eyes of
Bobby Ciaro (DeVito), Hoffa's
trusted friend, we are treated to
flashbacks over Hoffa's career
every once in a while returning to
the diner, where the story
progresses. This works
exceptionally well and other than
being so refreshingly original is
carried out so innovatively that this
must rank as one of the best films
I have ever seen. Somehow I just
don't think it will get the credit it
undoubtedly deserves. Why do I
hear you ask? Well, it's just that this
film has not been aimed at a British
audience. Although most
Americans are as familiar with the
name Hoffa as we are with
Thatcher, I couldn't help but feel
slightly left out, wishing I'd known
more about the man before I saw the
film.
If you enjoyed JFK, then you
must see this film, if only because
it recreates the same sort of
atmosphere, if you didn't then it'll
probably bore you senseless.
Some thought of Hoffa as a God,
some as the devil and opinion will
be divided about this film in a
similar way, though I can't
recommend it highly enough.

While spying on her son on his first
date at the zoo, Lionel's
domineering mother is bitten by a
rare monkey. The bite slowly
transforms her into a flesh-eating
zombie (ring any bells?) and the
mayhem begins.
This is the most gory film I've
seen in a long time; pulsating
internal organs, severed limbs and
blood by the tanker full, combine
to keep you on the brink of losing
your dinner right from the start.
It is also one of the funniest films
I've ever seen, the whole cinema
was falling around in the aisles so
I've got to recommend it to anyone
looking for a laugh.
Beware, this film is only for those
with strong stomachs and I wouldn't
advise having a big dinner before
seeing it, you certainly won't want
to eat afterwards!
There you go, fin.

The moment Jack Sommersby
(Richard Gere) returns from the
Civil War, to reclaim his life after
a seven year absence, he brings
dramatic change to his home town
and everyone in it. His wife, Laurel
(Jodie Foster), cannot believe that
C a n d y m a n
In inner city Chicago, there is a
legend of a hook-handed killer
named Candyman. This is the
subject of university student Helen
Lyle's (Virginia Masden) doctoral
thesis. Her investigations lead her
to an unsolved murder in a run-
down tower block known as Cabrini
Green. There she finds the first
piece of solid evidence - a giant
mural of the killer's screaming head
- and gradually the myth evolves
into uneasy reality.
Forget Nightmare On Elm Street,
this is a real horror movie. The
emphasis is not so much on blood
and sharp implements, although it
doesn't miss out on that, but more
on the breakdown of rationality and
gradual weakening of Lyle, whose
hard-faced attitude crumbles before
Candyman (Tony Todd) and his
dripping hook. The violence we are
exposed to is terrifying without
being particularly explicit, due to
excellent direction (from Bernard
Rose). Philip Glass provides an
brilliant, haunting soundtrack which
complements Candyman's deep,
echoing voice. Clive Barker has
finally realised that he should leave
film making to others (after the
awful Hellraiser trilogy) and stick
to writing and producing. All the
fuss about the recent spate of violent
movies has no foundation if they
continue to be of this quality.

Sommersby: coo
her once difficult and violent
husband has come back a kind and
loving man and neither can certain
members of the community.
This 'epic tale of love, deception,
denial, hope and sacrifice' starts
promisingly but quickly becomes
boring. The photography which
involves various shades of brown,
and the 'epicness' of the acting, is
a struggle to sit through. The only
rousing moment was the hanging at
the end. Unless you worship the
actors, go and see something more
interesting, like mud.
