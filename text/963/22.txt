Do the following phrases sound
familiar: courage, taking risks,
seizing the moment—and get one
more chance? They do don't they,
admit it. We've had them all by the
truckload before and by gum we're
going to have to sit through it all
again.
Daniel McCormick (Mel Gibson)
having been frozen for over fifty
years awakens to find himself in
1992, lost, alone and out of step.
Daniel never got a chance to declare
his love for his sweetheart Helen
(Isabel Glasser), and must now
come to terms with his own life, in
so doing, becoming a catalyst to
help others do the same.
You want to puke, right? Well go
right ahead and do it, I must say this
film can be faulted in many ways,
most of them arising from the fact
that it has all been done before, all
the morals have already been drilled
into us, isn't it about time we had
something more original, please?
My main gripe however, is that
this film tries to be too many things,
instead of simply concentrating on

what is really at the heart of this well be wholesome, edible, true and
picture; a love story. Like an onion thoughtful, but there's just so much
however, there are too many layers you can eat (right?) and by the time
to peel away, most of them may you get to the middle you've lost

Bernie La Plante (Dustin Hoffman),
risks life and limb to save the plane
full of people that has just crash-
landed about ten metres in front of
his car. Standing alone amidst a
driving rainstorm, Bernie in no way
thought it was a good idea, f ing and
blinding his way throughout the
whole rescue. This unlikely
'Accidental Hero' lives by the credo
'keep a low profile' and abiding by
this religion disappears into the
night leaving only a size 10B loafer,
lost in the mud, as a remnant of him
your appetite and it's all a bit bland
and tasteless. Strictly above
average.

ever being there.
Gale Gayley (Geena Davis) a TV
reporter aboard the plane, in search
of a good, wholesome, American
way type story begins to hunt this
'Angel of flight 104'.
To cut a long story short. John
Bubba and down and out (Andy
Garcia) comes forward as this hero
(Bernie having given him the
matching shoe) and so begins a
warped tale of Bernie desperately
trying to claim what's his and Gale
searching for the truth, while John
reaps the rewards.
The film finds its premises in
America's craving for heros—and
finds its irony in how the media and
indeed most of the nation define
those idols (the blow-dried,
designer-clad, optimistic and
superficially sincere and strictly
preferred).
While the acting is faultless,
especially Hoffman, the plot seems
too sugary and sweet to swallow
and as a comedy there just aren't
enough laughs to carry the film
along. It's too short and you are left
feeling in need of more to fill your
mind. Strictly for the optimists and
those with a passion for the 'there's
a little good in everyone' type of
thing. I'm sorry but this film just
didn't smack me in the face as hard
as I'd hoped.
