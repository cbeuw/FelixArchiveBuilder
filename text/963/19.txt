Alfred Hitchcock's Blackmail is the
first in a short series of silent films
with new scores at the Queen
Elizabeth Hall, the film itself has
been partly restored as well.
Watching the film with the live
musical accompaniment involved
having to appreciate both mediums
simultaneously, though obviously
each complemented the other, and
I found it a kind of schizophrenic
experience. On the music side, the
piece sounded startlingly modern in
places, and it seemed to lift the film
out of the conservative 1920's. I
also noticed how extensively the
music was used to convey an
emotion for lack of dialogue. The
film was also interseting unto itself
- one can see many elements found
in later Hitchcock, eg. the bird's
eye view of a winding staircase as
seen in Vertigo, and the acting,
although heavily hammed up, was
thouroughly enjoyable. Full marks
to the BFI.
Aralia Elegantissima.

Henrik Ibsen wrote this play in
1890: however, it is still not
outdated, being about a woman who
feels not only caught in her
marriage but in her life in general,
her demands reaching beyond
pomposity into the aesthetics of
suicide. This time, it was staged by
Felix 963
Hot Head Productions at the
Etcetera Theatre. It was a bit of a
surprise that the leading role was
played by a black actress because
it's a bit of a change to the usual
blonde stereotype and an interesting
feature. However, Julia Hagan
convinced in being a smug, spoilt
General's daughter (although I
found it irritating that nobody had
taught her how to move in this kind
of tight-cut dress). The actors and
actresses obviously were very
enthusiastic about their play. I liked
Anstey Thomas as Mrs Elvsted and
Kenneth Owens as Judge Brack best
since their acting was the most
natural; but perhaps it is due to a
prejudice that I found the others to
much of the British waffling type
rather than a more down-to-earth
Scandinavian approach.

T h e Duel of T a n c r e d i
a n d C l o r i n d a
To someone more used to
traditional opera, the set-up seemed
quite bizaare. The stage itself was
white: a huge screen with a niche
containing a sofa and limited
additional acting space. The actors
(Narrator: Paul Nilon; Clorinda:
Patricia Rozario; Tancredi:
Christopher Ventris) contrasted by
wearing black for the most part,
with a little green. No 12th Century
costumes here!
The acting was good, though
sometimes I couldn't correlate the
acting to the music. Their singing
was excellent—I could hear the
words 99% of the time.
It's a story of thwarted love.
Tancredi (who was a First Crusade
Crusader) falls in love with a
Saracen maiden. One night she
dresses as a warrior and sets fire to
an English encampment. He chases
after her, and they duel before
dawn. As the sun rises, he mortally
wounds her and removes her mask.
Horrified, he discovers his mistake.
She asks him to baptise her and pray
for her soul, even though she had
lived her life to the contrary. He
baptizes her and she dies in his
arms, having attained eternal peace.
Five Madrigals lead you through
the story to the duel, followed by
the duel itself. Monteverdi's
musical moods throughout do
justice to the story.
Possibly the modern presentation
is meant to appeal more to young
people—period costumes with a bit
more scenery might have served
better. Enjoyable, nonetheless.

Crazy For Y o u
Recession busting, depression
lifting, book now for a mid-exams
treat, I challenge anyone to emerge
from this show not whistling and
skipping. If you see one show whilst
you're in London make it this one.
You will not see better sets,
costumes, choreography, dancing,
singing or acting. They've defintely
got rhythm.

B l u e b e a r d ' s Castle
This second item in the double bill
salvaged the 'operatic feel' to the
evening, which the first item
(although technically operatic)
didn't quite have. The introduction
was intriguing: a screen depicting
twilight, a low voice in a strange
tongue, and a woman dressed in a
mildly seductive manner setting the
scene in an eerie fashion...cue
Bluebeard (Gwynne Howell) and
his new wife, Judith (Sally
Burgess). The screen rises to reveal
a castle corridor.
Judith becomes intrigued as to
why seven doors are always locked.
On persuasion he relinquishes to her
the seven keys, with increasing
reluctance. Behind each door is
revealed an aspect of him which he
doesn't want her to discover—a
torture chamber, an armoury, a
treasury, and a secret garden, each
stained with blood. The fifth door
reveals his kingdom (electrifying
music at this point—some of the
words were unfortunately drowned
out), followed by a pool of silent
tears behind the sixth. When she
finally persuades him to open the
seventh door, she discovers three
wives (not murdered, but alive)
belonging to the Morning, Noon
and Twilight. She then goes to join
them, as wife of the Night, leaving
Bluebeard alone.
The acting and music were very
good indeed, and there was clever
use of staging throughout. There's
an interesting twist at the end of the
tale.
A thoroughly entertaining opera,
and evening as a whole.
