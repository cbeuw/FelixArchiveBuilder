The Horror of GUC
Expecting a meeting of eighty
students held in a bar to be
constructive, reasoned and useful
would be a little too much. When
it is a meeting of the most
egocentric personalities in the
University of London, productive
debate is not on the cards. Last
Tuesday's meeting of GUC, the
General Union Council of the
University of London students'
union went far beyond this.
It was not the votes upon votes
upon votes, or the quoting obscure
strictures from a mystical little
green book, even the fact that the
ballot boxes for one election closed
before any candidate had a chance
to speak, it may have been that half
an hour was spent discussing
whether men should be permitted to
vote in the women's officer
election, but it wasn't. What really
gaulled was the fact only ten people
felt they had the right to impose all
of this on the rest of the meeting.
Every time an issue was raised,
the same faces felt they had to stand
up, rather like watching a human
merry-go-round of wooden,
garishly painted models
continuously enjoying the sound of
their own voices. Unfortunately, if
you did want to speak and you
weren't deeply personally aquainted
with the chair of the meeting, you
did not stand a chance.
The only moment in which
freedom of speech reared its ugly
head was when Sharon Redrobe,
president of Royal Veterinary
College, forced her way to the
microphone to complain about not
being allowed to speak, which was
a fair point, but only added to the
general chaos.
How can this body expect to
Felix 963
represent the students of London?
The few that control and run U L U
are elected from the odd one or two
who bother to turn up to G U C .
Generally, they are sabbaticals or
heavily involved in internal politics,
so spend most of their time
perpetuating the backstabbing and
infighting that takes place at GUC.
The few good things that do get
done, are hidden behind closed
doors so that they do not fall prey
to some personal vendetta from
some other hack.
It is small wonder that colleges
like Imperial consider opting out of
the University of London, if this is
the best they have to offer. Bound
up with a deeply undemocratic
structure, a building which is seen
as a venue or a leisure centre and
representation of sixty thousand
students by a self-centred clique, I
doubt if the Univerisity of London
Union will continue in its present
form for very much longer and
Opinion
24 March 1993
GUC should seriously consider the
need for its own existence. And the
sooner it does get its act in gear and
does some serious restructuring, the
sooner it will lose its well earned
reputation as an ego supporting, CV
boosting, small-minded coven of
rejects from the real world.

The winner of the competition
hosted by IC Radio last week was
Raggie from Physics. He
nominated Keith Morale from
Physics I to be slagged off. With
the limited data that he (Keith)
lives in the library, here goes:
Keith you sad man, get out the
library! It is annoying to the
librarians and to all who use the
library. Get a proper home, then
a life!
Islam - the arguement so far...
Felix 958: ConSoc write to Felix,
describing a letter sent to them by
the Islamic Soc, challenging them
to 'an open debate on Government
policy in the Middle East'. ConSoc
shit-stir by reporting that the Islamic
Soc called western civilisation 'a
disaster' and replied by mocking the
fact that Islamic Soc claimed that
Islam to be 'complete ideology'.
Felix 959: Muzaffar Qureshi
writes in complaining about the
frivolous use of the word 'Jehad'.
Abdullah (no surname) also writes
in, attacking the western civilisation
and plugs what Islam offers, in 300
or so words of what could be
mistaken for a political manifesto.
He goes on to arrogandy forgive the
ignorance of ConSoc and again
invites them to the debate
mentioned in Felix 958.
Felix 960: Beit Back slags of
Islam. L M Urban from
Biochemistry writes in to defend the
western civilisation and urges
Abdullah to make the distinction
between a government and a
religion. He/she takes examples
from he/she considers to be fuck-
ups on the part of Islam, and takes
the shine off the Islam ideology.
Felix 961: This was the four page
election special, so no space for
letters.
Felix 962: A leaflet written by
Najeeb Khan that was banned
around college is re-printed in
Felix. It plugs at considerable
length the Islam ideology and slags
off the British Government. Fahad
El-Adawi writes in defending Islam
(what happened to Abdullah or
Islamic Soc?). His (I assume Fahad
is a he) letter is a montage of quotes
and propaganda for the Islam 'way
of life'.
Felix 963: Geoff Maxwell steps
in on behalf of CathSoc as defence
for the British Government in a
short-ish letter. Alan Bailey on the
other hand adopts the space-filling
technique of letter writing in an
attempt to settle the dispute. Not a
bad effort. Other students/ex-
chairpersons add their two pennies
worth.
Felix 964: Roll up! Roll up! Place
up ya bets! You'd be stupid to miss
this once off opportunity to make
money! Simply guess what will
happen next and decide on how
much you want to gamble. Present
your cash and choice to Felix by
12pm on the first day after the
holiday and see your money
proliferate.
9/7 F A V - Islamic Soc write in with
more propaganda
5/2 - An outsider to the argument
writes in with his/her opinion
4/1 - The printing machine or the
typesetter will fuck up, so there will
not be a Felix for the next six weeks
5/1 - Abdullah returns by slagging
off the western civilisation
13/2 - Someone writes in
complaining about this article
8/1 - Fehad El-Adawi re-defends
Islam with more extracts from the
Quran
17/2 - Jonty abandons the letters
pages in despair
15/1 - ConSoc write in...
33/1 - Another Beit Back
50/1 - Alan Bailey replies...
66/1 - Islamic Soc issue a fatwa
condeming all pro-western
civilisationists to death
200/1 - Crocky replies...
333/1 - A l l Socs are suspended for
boring students with the debate
10,00/1 - Felix is discontinued
70,000/1 - The world will end
2,283,273/1 - Pigs learn to fly
999,999,999/1 - All relevant Socs
and persons involved agree to differ
and accept each others opinion, but
write into Felix explaining this in
approx. 10,000 words
1,000,000,000/1 - The entire matter
is forgotten and the letters pages
become Islam-free

Silwood sulk about elections
Dear Jonty,
By now everyone is doubtless
sick of hearing about the elections,
but with the prospect of another one
next term for the Hon Sec I feel I
should say something.
Silwood Park this year was
completely ignored by all who stood
in the sabbatical elections, so if you
got elected well done, whoever you
are. There was no information
available on any of the candidates
for any of the posts, a fact reflected
in the news that even though there
was a 40% turn out to vote at
Silwood almost 80% of those that
voted opted for new election for all
of the posts.
There aren't many votes at
Silwood, I accept that, but like it or
not if you just got elected you are
responsible for us. Expecting you
all to visit Silwood or to hold a
hustings here is probably too much
to ask (although a certain Chris
Davidson once visited to canvas for
votes) but I don't think it is too
much to expect some posters or
information on the candidates. It
doesn't take much to put some
posters in an internal envelope and
send them to Silwood I'm sure the
Union represenatives here would be
only too happy to pin them up.
Before you all accuse us of being
apathetic and not finding out for
ourselves about the elections just
have another quick look at 40% turn
out to vote and compare it to the
average for the whole of Imperial.
If that is apathy then how would
your describe the candidates attitude
to Silwood?
Just to end on a bit of free advice
for anyone standing for the Hon Sec
post, I know where there's about 40
or 50 votes just waiting to be
snapped up if you can be bothered.
Nigel Vamdell (and anyone else
who voted new election at Siwood).
