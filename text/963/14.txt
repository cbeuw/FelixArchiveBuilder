I saw a vision of loveliness at this
gig, exquisite and elegant,
captivating and chairning, gorgeous
and graceful. But enough of this
mindless banter, onto the band. The
Fat Lady Sings are, in stature,
short. Very. And they feature
seventies man, complete with
dancing shoes,as their keyboard
player. I felt quite superior in my
usual smug manner. But having
been away for many a moon, they
exhibited a quite understandable, if
not totally popular, desire to play
some new material, just playing an
old song 'when we think you're
getting totally hacked off. And of
this new material my undoubted
favourite was a nifty little tune
called 'Drunkard Logic', along with

'To Begin at the Beginning,' wrote
Dylan Thomas. He was sadly
mistaken. Beginning there is
definitely not the way to lead a life,
particularly this one.
Today has not been a day for
objectivity, but for preoccupation.
Introspective self—pity, and a lack
of real spice in my life are eating
me like one of Idi Amin's notorious
rats. Bitter and twisted, the last
thing I want to see, the last thing I
deserve is another dose of 3'A
fucking Minutes.
They seem to follow me around.
I saw them support Kingmaker
(who?), had the single rammed
down my throat, and then suffered
fellow Irish band, Hothouse
Flowers' cover, 'Love Don't Work
This Way' (and they thought I
wouldn't notice that one).
But, as I was asked, 'Have they
got any better?' No ,they haven't.
This was proved by the final song
of the set, their raison d'etre,
'Arclight'. It's always been
majestic, but it's been more exalted
before, than tonight, where it
sounded drowned in over powering
drums at the start, and too quiet at
the end. No, The Fat Lady Sings
haven't got any better, but that
doesn't mean they're no good.
They're good, but they're not any
better. It ain't over yet.

the ICU travesty. Today of all days,
this is not what I want.
I'm on my own. The Indie beer
boys all take one look and think 'no
girlfriend, not out with the lads, no
Senseless Things shirt must be
a wanker.' They're right though.
The singer is wearing eye—shadow.
They are pitiful, I can't go on with
this.
Mint 400 are loud but samey, I
was reasonably impressed, but fuck
it, I wouldn't buy it.
The T-shirt girl gave me a badge,
so not an entirely wasted evening.

Radiohead, one of the best new
bands in Britain at present, or just
a haphazard project that got lucky
with one song, opinion concerning
their arrival is divided. If 'creep'
was just a one-hit wonder, as the
band introduces it as, is there
anything more we can expect from
them? Radiohead's most noticeable
musical direction is the contrast in
volume employed between verse
and chorus. This is taken to the
extreme with an introductory
solitary bassline, drums and
whispering vocals whilst after a
couple of phrases the rest of the
band crash in creating a rather
frenzied but impressive maelstrom
of noise.
However, even if such a song-
structure is repetitive, it is of course
wildly different from the lame non-
entities on the scene at present.
Indeed Radiohead pick up on this
for one of their main lyrical themes-
'Pop is dead, long live pop, died a
death of back catalogue.' Radiohead
appear as the saviours of pop,
which is very noble if they have the
music to go with it.
And after tonight, I think they
have. This is reinforced by their
somewhat frustrated character. As
Thorn Yorke sings, he screws up
his face, his rank, sheared hair
falling around him, whilst Jon
Greenwood plays the guitar with the
fretboard behind his head, or strums
the guitar against the plectrum.
Anyone can play guitar, but only a
few can play like Jonny Greenwood
without grinding their knuckles to
dust. Radiohead may be dominated
by an extreme self-loathing, an
almost destructive ideal of one's
So, in association with X F M (it's
indie radio, not racial equality)
we're here to commiserate the
passing of an auld enemy, the
T&C2. What the hell, I never liked
it anyway? So what if Vince Power
is the devil incarnate? Enough.
Eat, Eat, Eat. Swampy rockers
with a sound from who knows
where. I've told you all this before,
if you don't get the message now,
it'll be over your head forever. Eat.
Gorgeous. Heh, heh, heh, terrible
puns, what do I care? I'm free, to
do what I want, any old time. Shut
up, Shut up, I'll do what I want to
do.

persona-the bedraggled hair, taunt,
tight clothes and watery eyes paint
a pitiful picture of destitution, yet
behind the horror there is a certain
black humour which prevents the
affair from becoming a degraded
morbid show for the terminally
unstable revealing a slight glimmer
of hope. The band played
'Rhinestone Cowboy' as the first
encore, much to the amusement of
the crowd.
The highlight of the gig was the
new track 'Stop Whispering'.
Typical guitar rifts with Thorn
sharing his loneliness, his
difficulties with relating to other
people, his hatred of those that can,
and his instinct that he should be
seen but not heard. Anyway
halfway through the guitars totally
fade out followed by the bass and
drums whilst Thorn sings 'doesn't
matter anyway'. Then silence and
Thorn screeches ' F U C K Y O U ' .
The hatred, pain and outright
openness of this made everyone step
back, open their eyes and smile. We
love Radiohead, we thought. We
want to wrap him up and put him
to bed and read him a story and look
after him. Then the guitars are off
again, racing through an explosion
of energy, the crowd is moshing
and I am beaming at the beauty of
it all.
Radiohead are all love and all
hate, they are the ugly ducklings of
pop, with standard raised they are
ready to rescue the crumbling scene
that is British music. Radiohead are
quite capable of this, destined to
ride of into the sunset and live
happily ever after.
Amen and good luck.
Ralph.
