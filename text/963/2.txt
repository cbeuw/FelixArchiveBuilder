The City & Guilds Union elections
saw an unprecedented turnout on
Monday 15th and Tuesday 16th
March, with all positions contesting
some 170 votes each. Kate Dalton,
this year's C & G C U President, said
she had never known the 100- vote
quorum to be broken before.
Standing uncontested for the
position of President, Paul Griffith
took 141 of 171 votes cast, the
remainder going to New Election,
and a small number of papers being
spoilt. M r Griffith said later that he
was 'very happy to be elected',
adding that although the 6% voting
figures were not very good, he was
encouraged by the votes being three
times greater than that of previous
years. Most of the uncontested
candidates won by margins in the
region of 100 votes, with the
candidate for Vice-President, Joe
Baguley, scoring the lowest
majority with 113 votes to New
Election's 50 votes.
The only competition of the
C & G C U elections centred around
the post of Entertainments Chair,
with Subhashis Chowdury standing
against Tim Atkinson and New
Election. New Election was
eliminated on the first ballot, and
the reallocation of votes enabled M r
Chowdury to defeat M r Atkinson
by 30 votes on the second count.
Neither candidate was confident of
victory before the result was
announced, both agreeing that the
elections had been 'a fiasco'.
The winners are as follows: Paul
Griffith (President), Joe Baguley
(Vice- President), Mark Walton
(Honorary Secretary), Liam Cusack
(Honorary Junior Treasurer), Amit-
Ranjan Sinha (Academic Affairs
Officer), Ian Parish (Departmental
Society Officer), Subhashis
Chowdury (Ents Chair), Richard
Oussedik (Publicity Officer), Geoff
Maxwell (CGCA Representative),
and Bulbul Basu (Guildsheet
Editor).
RCS elections
by A n d r e w T s e n g
In a possible indication of his
popularity, Paul Thomas, RCS
President, failed to get elected as
RCS Academic Affairs Officer
(AAO).
Sarah Lee, the current A A O ,
attained a 23 vote majority over the
65 achieved by M r Thomas. In a
comment to Felix, Mr Thomas said,
'Sarah has done an excellent job, I
wish her the best of luck'.
Duncan Austin claimed the post
of Honorary Secretary in the only
other contested post, beating Mark
Summer by 31 votes.

There are opportunities for postgraduates to work
part-time at the Centre's Help Desk. Each successful
applicant will be required to undertake one duty
session a week of around four hours with pay at
PG rates.
The Help Desk operation is supported by the Apriori
Help Desk Management System. Apriori logs, tracks
and manages problems and queries from first
contract through to problem resolution. Whilst
knowledge of Unix, networking, and PC and Mac
applications is an advantage, the primary role is to
work with Apriori for which training will be
provided.
If you are interested in working as a member of the
Help Desk team and gaining experience in the m

post of Vice-President; Simon
Gibbons and Robert Leamon,
standing joindy failed to get ratified
by a RCS General Committee
Meeting (GenComm). In a letter
published in this issue of Felix, M r
Gibbons and M r Leamon cite their
year in Europe as the cause of
losing the uncontested election.
The post of president was
uncontested for the first time in
several years. Rhian Picton,
currently the Biochemistry
Departmental Representative, was
ratified as RCS president at the RCS
GenComm. In an interview with
Felix, Miss Picton announced her
intention to make startling changes
to the RCS. 'I'm going to have a
forum where people can complain
and give ideas'. When pressed
further she said, 'it's most
important that we give people what
they want'. Miss Picton later added
that she was looking towards closer
cooperation between the RCS and
the other Constituent College
Unions, naming the City And
Guilds College in particular.
In the remaining elected post,
Emma Holmes, currently the
Honorary Junior Treasurer, won
another term of office after standing
unopposed. Miss Holmes was
ratified at the RCS GenComm.
by A n d r e w T s e n g
William Waldegrave, Chancellor of
the Duchy of Lancaster, called for
a focused centre for science and
technology in Government in a
speech at Imperial.
Thursday 18th saw the cabinet
minister incharge of the Citizens
Charter and the Office of Science
and Technology speak by invitation
of Save British Science.
The Chancellor stressed that
applied research was not better, nor
more necessary than pure science
and technology research. M r
Waldegrave gave two conditions for
university teaching, 'firstly it should
be excellent, and secondly it should
be suitable'. He added that 'being
useful should be a side issue and
should not be important in deciding
whether a subject is taught'.
Professor Igor Aleksander, Head
of Electronic and Electrical
Engineering, queried M r
Waldegrave about short term
funding of projects being more
favoured than long term funding by
institutes and funding councils. M r
Waldegrave responded by saying
that, 'Universities should
concentrate on long term research
projects'.
Mr Waldegrave is expected to
bring out his Science A n d
Technology White Paper around
mid- to late-May.
