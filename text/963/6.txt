together.
We do not expect to be contesting
any further election, because we
have very tough degree work to do
out here. This, of course, is another
unfamiliar concept to those who
seem to consider themselves our
opponents, most of whom are
extending their RCS careers by the
traditional routes of retaking years,
hanging around on the dole, or
simply attempting to retain their
tenuous position at Imperial by
plagiarising the work of others.
Possibly the only good thing to
come of this election campaign is
that the current 'Hon Sec' (in the
sense of using the pot rather than
doing the job) has decided not to
screw up the job of president as well
next year.
We're sorry that we've had to
take part in the kind of bitching
campaign that we've always hated,
but distances of several hundred
kilometres make more conventional
debate impossible. Perhaps it's
quite appropriate anyway, given
that our 'opponents' had no
hesitation in taking advantage of our
inability to reply.

Tolerance and respect
Dear Jonty,
The recent debate in Felix on
Islam has, I believe, missed one
vital point. The document
distributed around College by the
Islamic Society, banned by security
and reprinted in Friday's Felix is
well written and informative.
However, it makes a misleading
and unfair comparison.
Whilst discarding the current
Islamic states as imperfect
implementations of the ideology of
Islam, it criticises the British
government directly. Is the author

Dear Jonty,
We hate having to write a C C U
rant, but we have been left no
choice by the actions of certain
members and hangers-on of the
RCSU. It is difficult to mount an
election campaign from another
country, but we managed. The first,
blatantly unfair, attempt to organise
an election (not that 'organise' will
be a familiar word to the people
concerned) was finally quashed
when it was realised that it was
simply an attempt for a few of the
RCS lads to swap the jobs around
a bit without involving
unpleasantness like democracy.
We then took part in the second
election campaign, and, for reasons
of normal student thrift, kept our
election advertising to a minimum
when we realised that we were
unopposed. We hadn't counted on
what appears to be some kind of 'tit
for tat' campaign by some of the
'hacks' and random hangers-on
who like to hang around the RCSU
congratulating themselves on their
importance. There was of course,
no way we could answer a series of
untrue allegations from Paris and
Padua, and no way that we could
put our mothballed election
campaign back into action against
New Election. It seems a typical
and rather sad case of a few of the
'mascotry boys' clique getting
Alan Bailey
Dear Jonty,
At the beginning of this academic
year I made a more than generous
offer of '...contributing to the air
fare to Iran for any Muslim who
hated this country and Western
culture in general.' This followed
the circulation of the infamous
'Nobby the sheep' article. My only
condition was that they promise
never to return. This offer was
NOT meant as an insult to the
Islamic community at all. It was in
fact aimed at those who quite
clearly have no respect for British
traditions, do not wisn to integrate
and really hate living here. I was in
fact prepared to do them a favour
(as well as the rest of us!). No one
took me up on the my offer.
I was therefore surprised to
receive in my pigeonhole yet
another article from the Islamic
society continuing the feud with
ConSoc. I wonder what dodgy
'organisation' is funding the Islamic
society as to enable them to
continually publish this garbage.
Not being a member of either
society, I feel in a position to
perhaps settle this dispute.
Let's take the Islamic letter first.
We are told that the countries in the
Middle East are not really Islamic
states. Well they seem to think so,
and anyway they are a damn sight
closer to an Islamic state than Great
Britain. Logically would it not
therefore be preferable for Najeeb
Khan to go to one of these?
Then Najeeb turns his eye to law
and order. He justifies the 'cutting
bits off people' punishments by
saying how barbaric some people
are in the West, and uses the case
of Jamie Bulger. He is thus
comparing Islamic Law to the
minds of crazed murderers! How
odd. He says that Islam believes in
the after life and that this motivates
people to behave themselves. After
life? What are you on? I certainly
wouldn't mind having a pint of it!
Then its the economy.
Apparently an Islamic state would
have 0% interest rates. What about
exports, exchange rates, inflation
etc. He missed out the issue of the
weather. No doubt under Islamic
law the sun would shine very day
and the rain wouldn't dare fall
because of the threat of the eternal
damnation! Like in 'Nobby the
sheep' he says that Islam could
provide the solutions to all the
world's problems. How would he
solve the biggest problems facing
this country? Those of the
Republican terrorists in Northern
Ireland and the issue of Europe.
He admits that there is no Islamic
state and of course, there could
never be in the modern world and
like other religiouns it's all fantasy
and the cause of most of the world's
problems.
Now the other side, ConSoc.
Nationally the Conservatives have
lost their way. We have a Prime
Minister with no real vision or
ideas. He is surrounded by a bunch
of nobodies (with a few exceptions)
in the cabinet who can't have the
best interests of the United
Kingdom at heart. If they did they
wouldn't be prepared to sell us
down the river in Europe as Major
intends to do. They also would treat
Northern Ireland as a genuine part
of the United Kingdom, instead of
indicating that the current
government is a perfect image of
the principal Western ideologies-
democracy, capitalism and social
welfare? If so, current affairs prove
that assumption to be wrong.
It is important to have some
debate on such important issues, but
both the Islamic and Conservative
societies need to be reminded of the
need for tolerance and mutual
respect.
Yours sincerely,
Geoff Maxwell, Elec Eng 2,
CathSoc Vice-President.
appeasing 1KA scum by continuing
with the treacherous Anglo-Irish
agreement. Most Tories must be
kicking themselves that they ever
got rid of the former P M whose
judgement was first class (except
for the Anglo-Irish agreement) and
who stuck up for the United
Kingdom at every opportunity
(unlike the grey suit).
The point I am making is that
neither the Tories or Muslims
should criticise each other when
their own houses are so out of
order. One side is based on fantasy
and would probably be better
understood after consuming a good
deal of mind blowing drugs. The
other is not sure where it's moving
or if it's even moving at all, and is
led by a dithering incompetent.
Come to think of it Mark and
Najeeb seem to be made for each
other.
Yours as ever,
Alan Bailey.
P.S. last week's Felix contained
at least five articles regarding Islam.
Might I suggest you change the
name of Felix to the 'Daily Jang'.
