The Easter Sports Ed Rant
Clubs, Societies & Sports
Felix 963 24 March 1993
It seems that the value of the Felix
Back Page has finally been realised,
and of recently we have been
inundated with reports and results.
I would like to thank everyone who
has given something in. However
I would just like to point out that
this year we have pursued a most-
recent-is-best policy and have given
first preference to the more recent
articles. So please, please, please if
you want your feature in, be quick
about it. Otherwise your efforts
may go to waste.
Finally, to digress, the British
Open Squash championships will be
taking place between 12th to 19th
April. Those interested in going to
have a look (no we don't have any
tickets to give away!) can obtain
Booking Forms in the Union
Office.

Here it is! The Sports Review of the
year for I C . A two-page
extravaganza containing the best of
the year; the results, the final
positions, the trophies and the
tournaments won. Yes, all in all a
conclusive and momentous year for
IC as can be seen, but ...
Unfortunately due to avoidable
circumstances, our Felix Easter
Special Edition is a bit short on its
own expectations and promises.
The fault being a break down of
communication. A l l the Sports
captains were to be informed and
were to duely write a brief
summary. However as with most
•things in life, something had to go
wrong. So without wallowing any
more in our sorrow I shall just thank
the enigmatic Dribblers for finally
bringing in a definitely positive
result (see back page).
Gosport is
On Friday 26th February, the IC
'sharks' went on tour for the first
time this term to Gosport. After
eventually deciding on which
boards to take and completely
emptying Salisbury's, we set off.
Friday night was spent consuming
the odd 'medicinal' pint and
wondering how a greying 50 year
old could be exployed as DJ. The
next morning at 7.00am, James
wasn't too impressed when I woke
him up to inform him that it was
bloody windy outside—miserable
git! Despite being of a reasonable
strength, the wind was inthe wrong
direction—offshore which is
dangerous for those still learning.
So we spent most of the morning
looking for a beach where the wind
was in a suitable direction (cross-
shore). We found just the place, a
small inlet for the intermediate,
bordering on the open sea for the
experts. Ignoring a small snow
flurry, and those wingeing about the
cold, we rigged up and went out.
Conditions were 'rippin': the gently
shelving beach was perfect to
launch from and the speeds we got
up to bridged on the orgasmic. We
were all revitalised by a humungous
Chinese on the Saturday evening in
preparation for a mind-blowing
Sunday. The conditions on Sunday
were similar when we got on the
water at lunchtime. One
exception—the windspeed went
through the roof. I almost dumped
in my wetsuit when I nearly lost
control during on particularly
screaming run. Those on the shorter
boards were jumping and carving
like I'd never seen before. There
was more to come: half way
through the afternoon we sailed into
a full-on snow blizzard: the wind
reached a crescendo and the
temperature dropped dramatically.
Being masochists we carried on,
until the wind finally dropped. A
truly bodacious weekend's
windsurfing except of course for
those board hoggers in the c l u b -
thieving gert gypsies! Despite being
introduced to the gaseous contents
of Sarah's bottomg, the journey
home passed without incident.
Thanks must go to Dan and Phil for
driving us around and to James and
Julia for some stormin'
organisation. If you too would like
to trip the watery fantastic with
us—come and see us any Tuesday
lunchtime—1.00pm in Southside
Lounge.
Can't find a summer job? Need a
break? Join us at one of the largest
arts festivals in the world!
The Edinburgh Festival
incorporates festivals of Street
Theatre, Jazz, Film, a Military
Tattoo and the Festival Fringe,
which is an 'anything goes' of
comedy, cabaret and theatre. This
year, it will take place from 15th
August to 4th September.
Theatre West End will be taking
three plays to the Edinburgh
Festival Fringe. We first spend a
few days converting a church hall
into a professional theatre. This
venue, which is one of around 150
on the Fringe, is used to stage both
our own plays and those of other
professional theatre groups, who
hire the venue from us for a few
hours each day. In all, there are
around five hundred shows on the
Fringe every day. We will provide
you with subsidised accommodation
in Edinburgh during the Festival,
and enough free time to enjoy being
there in return for a few hours work
in the venue each day.
Working in a theatre is fun,
whether it involves constructing the
stage, making props, working in the
Box Office, building the Box Office
or being on Front of House. Do not
worry i f you have had no
experience; this is an opportunity
that you are unlikely to have had
before and almost certainly will not
get again. We are always willing to
take anyone with little or no
knowledge of theatre work.
We shall be arriving in Edinburgh
a week early, in order to build the
venue, on 7th August and staying
until the end of the festival on 5th
September. If you are not free for
the whole time, don't worry, just
come for a week or so!
This will be Theatre West End's
tenth anniversary on the Fringe, and
to celebrate, we are having a party
to which everyone who is interested
in coming to Edinburgh is invited.
The Edinburgh Festival is the
biggest and the best four week long
party you can find in the U K in
August, see you there!
Anyone who is interested in being
involved with TWE '93 can find us
inthe DramSoc Storeroom in the
Union Building every lunchtime.
