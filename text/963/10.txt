Lise Yates digs deep into more history of London's fastest
expanding tube.
1989. Olympia & York, owners of
the Thatcher monument, Canary
Wharf, propose a private rail kink
to Central London; Cecil
Parkinson, temporarily distracted
for secretarial pursuits announces
the Jubilee Line extension in
November.
Isolated by the Department of
Transport and London
Underground (both preferred a fast
link from Liverpool Street to
Paddington 'Cross Rail', or a line
from Chelsea to Hackney), left
wing London boroughs (annoyed by
the 40% private capital
contribution), and powerful right
wing boroughs (Westminster and
City both wanted a line North of the
river), Parkinson's only supporter
was, predictably, the London
Docklands Development
Corporation (LDDC). Parkinson
ploughed on, securing the support
of the South London boroughs with
stations at Southwark and
Bermondsey.
The eleven new station buildings
over the ten miles of the track
consist of the most ambitious
expansion of London's ailing public
transport system since the Second
World War, opening up a whole
new area South of the Thames, an
area cruelly neglected by the tube
at the moment. (Only 30 of the 270
stations are South of the river), and
connect Docklands to the West End
in under twenty minutes.
The new station at Westminster
will be the lower floors of a new
Parliamentary building, in the
environmentally sensitive area on
Parliament Square from there the
line heads under the river to
Waterloo, interchanging with
British Rail and thence, to
Southwark. Southwark essentially
acts as an interchange for British
Rail's Waterloo East sited on the
corner of Blackfriars Road and The
Cut, it possesses a pivoting glass
canopy to close the station at night.
The next station down the line is
!
yet another British Rail interchange,
at London Bridge, and from there
the line proceeds to Bermondsey.
The second new station, and one in
the decaying inner city area, the
potential for rejuvenation of the
locality is massive. Situated at the
junction of Jamaica Road and
Keetons Road, designed to allow
daylight to flood down to the
platforms, and, with an office block
on top, curved to allow the sun's
rays to reach the homes beyond.
Canada Water is planned on an
interchange with the East London
Line between Rotherhithe and
Surrey Qyays, and incorporates a
new bus station. The line then
tunnels beneath the Thames to the
Isle of Dogs and to Canary Wharf,
the most expensive station on the
new line (projected cost Â£60M), is
expected to be amongst the six
busiest stations on the whole
network. Built within the West
India Docks, the station is mostly
hidden beneath a new park area,
with entrances rising from the
ground in huge glass bubbles.
The line tunnels below the river
yet again to North Greenwich,
which is to be built with three
platforms, facilitating a possible
future extension East to the Royal
Docks. The line tunnels below the
Thames for the fourth and final
time, North to emerge from tunnels
to run parallel with BR's North
London Line to interchange at
Canning Town with that Line and
the new East extension of the
Docklands Light Railway to the
Royal Docks and Beckton. The
Jubilee continues with the North
London Line to West Ham, to
interchange with the District/
Hammersmith & City and West
Ham, connected with a bridge with
extensive use of glass bricks. The
new line runs with the North
London line to its terminus at
Stratford, to interchange with the
Central Line, the proposed Channel
Tunnel line and the aforementioned
CrossRail.
Footnote
Whether the Jubilee ever gets built
is still very much up in the air. The
recent Government spending cuts
for London Transport (a 25 % cut
in funding) have already led to
closure proposals for two stations
(Aldwych, Mornington Crescent),
and the delay caused by them on
work at South Kensignton led
directly to the bomb being able to
be hidden behind exposed
panelling. This, coupled with the
need for public investment, mainly
from the financially troubled
Olympia & York, could still force
the abandonment of the project,
leaving London with a rapidly
decaying public transport system,
clogged road and increasing
environmental pollution.
THE MAGPIE PROJECT
Vacancyfor Laboratory Assistant III
Following the successful integration of two
other assistants a third is sought.
The MAGPIE project in the physics
department is the construction of the largest
pulsed power current generator in Europe.
When completed in March 1993 its 1.6 million
ampere current from a 2 million volt supply will
be used in the quest for nuclear fusion.
The job will be unglamorous, primarily being
gofering, form filling, telephoning, cleaning and
manual labour with a small well motivated team.
The applicant will be enthusiastic, intelligent
and trained in Physics or Engineering. Pay will
be via a EUROP student bursary.
Contract: ASAP for 3 months
