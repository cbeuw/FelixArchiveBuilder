T h e Poster Children
— T o o l Of T h e M a n
Do you remember The Weather
Prophets, dear reader? In other
words, are you ancient? Are you
pre— or post—C86? Forgive me for
this obsession with your age, but
I'm feeling a little over the hill
today. Any road, and it's long and
winding road to the point of all this,
I'll tell you now, any road, The
Poster Children sound a bit like the
aforementioned band. Sort Of.
They're the only reference point I
could pick out in my study of this
album. I did notice that my CD was
green, but then, we don't judge a
book by its cover in these parts, as
you should know by now. But this
is meandering, space-filling toss.
Hear, hear. So what's it all about?
Bear with me, I'm feeling
rhetorical, skirting around the
point, dressing it up in the
emporor's new wardrobe to cover
the whole focus of it all. There's
nothing much to say about this
album. I'm so non—commital, but
is it my job to make me care? Bear
with me, once more, 'cause I'm
finished now.

This took me a bit by surprise as
normally one would expect a solo
career to be a change of direction
and style - usually this goes hand
in hand with a drop in standards and
a shoddy first album.
Not guilty on both counts for our
Frank' (Kill Uncle Spoons); his
inherent good taste and sense of
style are still apparent here, with the
album taking over from the last lot
and demonstrating exactly how
much of The Pixies he was.
There is a Brian Wilson (Beach
Boys) song here, and an

About six months ago I had the
startling revelation that all music is
a waste of time. I'm sure many of
you will disagree, that without
music it would be a dull place. But
ask yourself, why? Why would it
be a dull place, and indeed would
it? When was the last time a piece
of music prompted more than a
short—lived emotional response?
Has this ever happened?
The problem that I have with
music is, what's it all for? Is it truly
music's place to be revolutionary?
Personally it would be far easier to

B o y f r i e n d — H a i r y Banjo
Sometimes titles can be so apt.
How can Hairy Banjo be an apt
tide, you wittering baffoon?
Indulge me, my friend. This
album sounds like it was played on
a hairy banjo. It's murkey, turkey,
lurky sub-Big Star/Teenage Fanclub
stuff. There's a song about wearing
leather and plastic which sounds a
bit kinky. Have I said enough about
the music now, I want to go to bed?

instrumental that really deserves
lyrics. I always seem to find The
Smiths on things these days (That's
only because you refuse to accept
that Morrissey is a sad has-been
-M.Ed), and sure enough they're on
the third track of side two. No bad
thing that, after all, if you're going
to rob, may as well be the best.(Are
we still talking about The Smiths
here? -M.Ed.)
Not extraordinarily good but I
would have to rate it as a Very.

believe in music if it was, but how
can it? I don't want music that even
attempts to.
Some music though is music for
its own sake, purely for the sound.
It doesn't try to change you, to
shape you. That it leaves up to you,
the only person that can affect you.
I find in this music something that
is much more than I expect,
something that can be considered
pure.
I see a light at the end of the
tunnel and it's green,

— A g a i n s t Perfection
Adorable. Adorable have one really
great song: their first single,
'Sunshine Smile'. A n oh-so
beautiful lament on love. It's not
included here, so all this is a bit off
the wall, but I thought you'd like
to know. What is here, man? What
is here? Oh, it's all competent, all
'finely crafted' (Eeeek, a cliche),
stuff, and all that, but there's
nothing that makes me really want
to scream and shout and cry and
dance and prance about like that
first single. And that makes me
want to scream and shout.

Rod S t e w a r t — L e a d Vocalist
Rod Stewart, a man once beguiling
enough to be young and good.
Listening to the early part of this
album, you can see it all again. The
heady heights of The Faces were his
making ground. The easy bluesy
raunch of the pubbing lads laid
down a channel for present
bohemians such as Quireboys and
Black Crowes. The airbrushed
complexion of a band on the way
down into decadance in hazy smoke
is an image which has been with us
ever since.
But what happened to Rod?—The
glory days of such epic eyeopeners
as 'Handbags and Gladrags'—
surely a 70s soundtrack, and 'Cindy
Incidentally' were only a passing
turn. As Rod became a star,
juggling fabulous women and
football fanaticism he slowly drifted

I have a problem. Can you picture
this? It's a summer evening, the sun
just reachin' the horizon and a slight
breeze wafts around the gathering
of friends that have gathered to
chat. In the background a there is
a moment of silence as one track
ends and the next starts. 'What is
this?' one asks. 'Something I picked
up recently' is the reply. That's the
problem.
I have no idea what they're going
on about, and I fear that most
people that listen to this. It's not that
M o l l y Half H e a d
— A n Interview, sort of.
Who the fuck are Molly Half Head
? ... Heads are scratched and brains
racked.
Don't panic, folks, this is by way
of introduction. Yet again,
Manchester has produced a band
among bands. The story so far is:-
Four lads got together just over a
year ago, wrote some songs, played
some gigs, and at the end of 1992
caused an absolute riot at the 'In the
City' conference, where every
single major record company in the
country clamoured for their
signatures. Normal people, at this
point, sign the contract and jet off
to Brazil to get deep inside
themselves for that crucial first
album... So what do Molly Half
Head do ?... Guessed it yet ? ...
That's right, sign to a local
Manchester independent, (Those of
you who are a little less susceptible
to the hype might note that the band
actually signed to Columbia, part of
Sony Music, for a 'Amillion, and
just signed to Playtime, the
independent for two singles to gain
some credibility with the saddoes
who don't believe that major labels
from his roots. No more would we
hear the energy of 'Stay With Me'.
The loopy guitar intro scratching
across vinyl and hitting your
feelgood buttons. All we're left with
is the rump end of 'Lead Vocalist',
by which stage it should be just
'Vocalist' as Rod's got no band to
lead. The second half comprises of
covers from various star turns like
Stevie Nicks and the Stones etc. But
like most of Rod's career since the
Faces, it's bland and plays its hand
too early. Only Tom Waits' 'Tom
Traubert Blues' finishes with the
open hand of youth regained.
The remaining Faces reformed
recently for M T V , so maybe Rod's
getting the message; the sad thing
was he was really quite good back
then. Who wants to live forever?

it's crap, nothing further from the
truth. It's fine, very fine. The music
that is. For the lyrics I can't say a
thing. I have a feeling that they are
'political', whatever the hell that
means in a time when everyone is
trying to broadcast their own idea
of perfection. But if nobody listens
to what you have to say no matter
how good it is you'll get nowhere.
Even if people do listen to you most
of them are so locked up in their
own dreams that they'll just ignore
you.

The Music (oh yeah...bit of an
old tangent there, but we're back
now - calm down alright!) I said
'Sounds a bit like early Killing
Joke.' They said ' A lot of people
say that, but we've never heard any
so I don't really know.' It doesn't
really sound that much like Killing
Joke at all really, I was just being
a clever bastard ... obviously a
universal hack problem it seems.
The single, 'Taste of You', is
something of a masterstroke, so
much so in fact, that we took the
interview along with the publicist's
right arm, as she proffered it. Once
again - this happens with everyone
I like - the B-side, 'Vivid Witsun'
is better than the A-side. Still, I'm
picking bones.
Now brass tacks. Molly Half
Head are very, very good indeed.
