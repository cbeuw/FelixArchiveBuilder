The BEST Summer Programme '93
is now in full swing. From July to
September, Lisbon to Tallinn,
Business Psychology to Arctic
Marine Technilogy there will at
least be a BEST summer course to
match your interests.
The Board of European Students
of Technology's (BEST)
programme is financed by Tempus
(an E E C scheme) and the
organising universities, allowing the
course all inclusive attendance fees
to range from free (which is most
of them) to a maximum of 100 E C U
(around Â£80). The courses
themselves consist of 2-4 week
academic, social and cultural
activities in groups of 20-30
students from all over Europe.
Accommodation and catering are
fully provided at no additional cost,
as well as a range of extra activities.
Interested? Well, why don't you
come along to room 400 in Chem
Eng, any Wednesday at 12.00
(sharp), where you will have the
opportunity to receive more
information as well as meet the
current BEST members at IC. I
must that the Chemical Engineering
Department for their support,
without which we would not have
a BEST group.
Any Chem Eng 'year in Europe'
students wishing to attend a careers
fair in Paris in order to find a
summer placement in France should
come by as well.
