The Clinton Factor
As fireworks burst over Pennsylvania Avenue, the Labour Party looked
West for inspiration. Would the Clinton Factor help ? Could the party
reform? Would John Smith ever win an election? Mimi Chakraborty
looks into the future...and prophesises doom.
Fourteen years in the doghouse is
always bad for morale, and the
party John Smith has inherited have
reasons to be seriously depressed.
A record fourth election defeat
takes some explaining and for
Labour, answers haven't been easy
to find. It's not that the party was
unpopular, it's not that people
didn't like them, it's just that for the
few nanoseconds in April when they
slipped behind the Tories in the
polls some mean person came along
and called an election. Once it was
all over, they leapt back into the
lead again and have scarcely looked
back since. A few short months
after he became his own man, John
Major set about exploring the
territory of negative popularity,
going where no man had gone
before. No wonder the defeat was
so hard to swallow.
Almost a year on, however,
Labour seem set upon bungling the
next election as well, by dint of
simply not bothering to change.
Having failed to capitalise on the
Tories new Kamikaze-style of
government, the party fell all over
itself in the rush to squabble about
'Clintonisation'. From the reactions
of some, one could be forgiven for
thinking that this was a process
which compelled paid-up members
of the Party to have 'Bill is my hero'
tattooed across their foreheads. The
idea of sending a delegation of
shadow-cabinet ministers to meet
Clinton's top aides and gen up on
How To Win An Election After a
Very Long Time seems modest by
comparison. However, it still
provoked howls of outrage from
those who saw the creeping hand of
Clintoriisation was nothing less than
the beginning of 'a battle for the
soul of the Labour Party'. These are
exactly the people who John Smith
would like never to have to speak
to again, but sadly they are all
members of his own party.
If the traditionalists are unhappy,
it was nothing compared to the
mods, many of whom were
muttering loudly about the
incompetence of the new
leadership. In the months following
their election John Smith and
Margaret Becket found themselves
fielding accusations of weak
leadership, lack of direction and of
'sleepwalking into electoral
oblivion'. These same months saw
the Tories lurch gracelessly from
one calamatous decision to another
and yet another still. After an
unprecidented catalogue of
disasters; the retreat from the E R M ;
u-turns over the pit closures;
allegations over Matrix Churhill;
David Mellor's affair; Norman
Lamont's cheque-card, houseguest,
drinking habits,...etc, it was said of
the Prime Minister that he had the
uncommon ability to spot a crisis on
the horizon and lead his whole party
into it before most political pundits
had even realised it was there.
Against an onslaught of better
advice, John Major stoically led by
the chin taking on apparently any
comers. In a clearly tactical
decision designed to shake up a
party in danger of falling into a
complacent snooze, Nice-Mr-Major
led his party through a tableau-
vivant of Dante's seven circles of
Hell. Displaying masterful
leadership not normally seen
beyond the lush fields of 'One Man
and his Dog', the Prime Minister
shepherded an increasingly
bewildered flock into policy-
collapse, party division, public
fighting, media derision,
international humiliation and at the
very point his party had its lowest
popularity rating since the war, he
threatened it with a General
election.
The Tories didn't bother to stop
when they saw a brick wall, they
just went on going. A week began
to look like a long time between
crises and increasingly incredulous
hacks found themselves scrambling
to keep up with a Prime Minister
who was always one disaster ahead.
John Smith, whose debating talents
lie in a somewhat forensic ability to
dessemble rhetoric, found himself
unexpectedly flailing and his skill
irrelevant. With an a-la-carte menu
of pit closures, public interest
immunity certificates, hospital
closures, rail privatisation, dodgy
arms-sales, rising unemployment,
media-intrusions, royal taxes, he
was still unable to impose himself
on any of the debates. Increasingly
this failed to cheer Labour
backbenchers, who began to ask
each other if anyone remembered
voting for him, and if so why.
Bryan Gould spoke of the party 're-
considering its decision to elect
John Smith', others chipped in with
'failure of radicalism' and John
Prescott's plea 'for God's sake give
the man a chance' had the effect of
making a poor leader look even
more hopeless. What had gone
wrong? John Smith had emerged as
the front-runner in the Labour
leadership campaign even as Neil
Kinnock stepped off the platform on
April 9th. His eventual election on
July 18th was only a formality. He
had planned to give his party time
to recover from its defeat while
introducing a series of rolling
reforms—his 'new plan for a new
century', evidence that he inclined
toward the long view. Unhappily,
he tripped over the short view first,
and in less than four months he
seemed to have fallen flat on his
face.
To be fair to John Smith, it was
never really his fault. He had been
all set for combat with a man in a
grey suit, who liked cricket and said
'not inconsiderably' a lot. Nobody
told him when he took the job that
the real enemy would be a
saxophone playing JFK look-a-like
from small-town America. When
Clinton won in November, it was
death-by-comparison for John
Smith. If the Tories support of the
Republican campaign was a
blunder, the ensueing acrimony still
had the happy result of shielding
Major from any direct counterpoint
with the new President. Not so the
luckless Mr Smith, whose party
held a champagne bash at the
Dorchester to celebrate the
Presidential inauguration. Labour
had forged links with its opposite
number during the election also,
and had presented themselves as
being on the same side fighting the
same battles against the same
enemy, and the party was to boast
a common victory. As a strategic
move this ranks with inviting your
girlfriend to meet a distant
cousin—who happens to be
fabulously sexy, incredibly
powerful and America's most
popular person—and then hoping
you're the one she still wants to go
out with.
