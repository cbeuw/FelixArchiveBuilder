Cambridge killed by IC gunmen
In the first competition of the season,
the IC magnificent seven (plus Lee
"Incredibly hunky and talented"
Clements) blasted their way to victo-
ry over the Cambridge toffs.
The competition opened with
Jacob "the Horn" Thorne stepping
up against the best shooters that
Cambridge had to offer. Not intimi-
dated in the least, Jacob coolly shot
the string that held the four targets up
- sending them to the floor and the
Cambridge team into disarray.
Following the fiercely fought battle
in .22 pistol, featuring millimetre
precision from the likes of "Dead-
eye" Dick Day and Mike "Ice-cool"
Zethrin, the competition moved onto
full bore pistol. Here the true IC skill
shone through. As Graham-the-kid
and Jon "Nutter" McCartney pep-
pered the bullseye, their team took it
upon themselves to leave their own
marks - on the carpet.
As the display of cool nerve and
steady arm continued the IC squad
was forced to dig deep against a late
comeback but it was too late. The
result was inevitable - glory for IC.
IC 3943 - 3675 Cambridge
Mighty IC rule the waves
The first head race of the season saw
Imperial crews sweep the opposition
away with apparent ease at the
Peterborough Head of the Nene. The
pre-Christmas training camp and
hard winter work is obviously start-
ing to pay dividends, with the men's
crews claiming the top four positions
overall in the morning's 2.7km
warm-up race, backed up by division
wins for the men's novice four (tenth
overall) and women's open coxless
four (eighteenth overall). The 4.2km
eights race in the afternoon presented
the women the sternest test in the
shape of the Cambridge blue boat.
Holding a higher rate of striking then
their light blue opponents over the
whole course, IC looked sharper and
more focused than the larger
Cambridge girls, which showed in
the fantastic result, IC winning by a
clear six seconds over the University
of London, with Cambridge down in
third place. The men's crews were up
against more feeble opposition in the
shape of the Cambridge lightweights,
and beat them by a suitable margin to
take first and second overall. The
women's second eight couldn't quite
manage to beat their opposite num-
bers from Cambridge, but still came
away with victory in their division.
Both men's and women's novice
eights raced competitively, but were
both beaten by Cambridge college
first eights.
The women's crews now shape up
to take on Cambridge head-to-head
at Henley on Sunday where they
hope for a repeat victory. The men's
squad continues with preparations
for National squad selection(first
eight) and a trip to Ireland (second
and third eights) with the women's
first eight to take on Trinity College
(Dublin), University College
(Dublin) and the tough Irish club,
Neptine.
Last weekend the novice men
went to Burway on a mission to
redeem themselves after a mediocre
showing in the eights a
Peterborough. The A crew won by
miles, leaving the B crew in second
place but still 30 seconds clear of the
nearest opposition.
Overall, not a bad start to the year!
RCS sent packing by baggage handlers
A disappointing turn-out resulted in
RCS meeting the luggage-lugging
lard-arses with only thirteen men.
After borrowing two players we
went out to face the incredible mass
of the opposition. Their size and
power was telling, particularly in the
forwards, but we fought well and,
thanks to our superior speed and
mobility, scored a marvellous try -
Colone crashing over the line after
beating an incredible seven tackles.
In the second half against wind and
rain the RCS passing want banana-
shaped to say the least and the bag-
gage-handlers took control.
Stout tackling against their heavier
forwards prevented an even greater
loss. Man of the match was Anthony
Spicer. Spoon of the match was
awarded to Darren Bryce.
RCS 7 - 34 Heathrow B H
Love lost, race won
Certainly the muddiest course in the
London Colleges league, Guildford
provided a tough race, especially for
Zola Budd who lost her shoe in the
ploughed fields. There was also dis-
appointment for Yellow-Arse, whose
soap-opera love saga with his ex-
girlfriend finally ended when she did
not even turn up to watch him run.
[Bad luck there, Mr Arse - Sports Ed]
He was rubbish anyway.
Jennie, AGAIN, won the women's
race with Dawn putting her best per-
formance of the year. Gaffer, in his
element in the mud-wrestling condi-
tions, was pleased with his run which
was stimulated by his weekend
innings of twenty-eight in Exeter.
After blocking the showers with
mud, IC cross country made a quick
dash to the bar where we won the
post-race drinking competition - hee
hee! Unfortunately we had to depart
early to meet Poland!
Five in a row for IC pot-heads
After a run of four straight victories,
Imperial snooker team set off for
Norwich to play UEA. The A-team
began slowly, trailing 6-1 early on
before fine wins by Simon, Alex and
Phil pulled the final score up to 10-
10. The B-team found going far eas-
ier, beating their opponents 12-4
including wins by Steff and new
boys Aki and Tony. The return
match next week should provide
some equally exciting snooker.
Firsts still got some Amo left
At last, a victory for the firsts! Last
week in BUSA "we wuz robbed" 5-
4 on penalties due to a poor effort by
"Pretty boy" Alex. We won today
despite the continuing absence of
"Goal Machine" Ike, and having to
field mental patients Tony "Don't
worry, I'll only break one leg"
Hallett and Jules "Oi, you want
some?" Porpeca. With a ferocious
wind behind us, we somehow only
managed to be an Amo goal up at
halftime, with Jamie having a shot
come back off the post. In the second
half we really took the piss, with
Alex dancing around the keeper and
Amo easily completing his hat-trick!
Overall, it was way too easy, with
great efforts throughout, except Jules
'cos he's still shit.
