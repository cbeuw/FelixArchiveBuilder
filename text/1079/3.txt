Deaths were 'avoidable'
MATTHEW BENNETT
An official report on last year's
meningitis outbreak at Cardiff
University has suggested that the
deaths of two 19-year-old students
could have been avoided had mass
vaccination been implemented, and
has suggested a review of national
guidelines.
Last year, seven students contract-
ed meningitis between October and
December. The first made a full
recovery. The second case occurred
four weeks and one day later, in the
same hall of residence. Since nation-
al guidelines state that cases four
weeks apart are unconnected, the
case was treated as a separate inci-
dent, and emergency vaccinations
were not administered. Only after
several more occurrences of menin-
gitis came to light were inoculations
were given to more than 1,000 stu-
dents. Tests have since established
that all the cases in Cardiff were
caused by the same strain of menin-
gitis bacterium, strongly indicating
that they were connected.
One senior health official stated
"My conscience is clear on this one.
I don't believe any of the decisions
made by the outbreak control team
were wrong. I believe we made the
right decisions at the time." He went
on to suggest that a rethink of the
guidelines might be necessary, par-
ticularly regarding what is defined as
"close contact". He also emphasised
that many people's understanding of
the development and spread of
meningitis is still primitive. It is
believed that meningitis is conta-
gious only through close contact,
although none of the students affect-
ed were close friends.
Meanwhile, Cardiff University
students expressed concerns about
the lack of communication between
the University and the student popu-
lation, and a lack of up to date infor-
mation.
The meningitis research founda-
tion is funding various projects at St.
Mary's to investigate why the vast
majority of the population seem
immune to meningitis, while a few
are susceptible and become seriously
ill when they come into contact with
the infection.
The staff of Imperial College's
health centre stress that there have
been no cases of meningitis at IC.
Sir Ron piles on the pounds

For the second year running, univer-
sities have been required to make
public the salaries of their top staff.
Imperial College's Rector, Sir
Ronald Oxburgh, recieved a pay rise
of £1,000 last year, making him the
UK's 45th most highly-paid Vice
Chancellor and taking him up to an
annual salary of £104,000. This is
comparable with other London insti-
tutions, but these salaries are not typ-
ical nationwide. The overwhelming
majority were between £70,000 and
£90,000, with the lowest figures list-
ed being between £30,000 and
£40,000. Most vice-chancellors saw
significant increases on the previous
year, although Strathclyde's J.
Arbuthnott had a 15% decrease from
£120,000 to £102,110.
There were some marked differ-
ences between the salaries of institu-
tions of similar reputations, most
notably with the vice-chancellors of
Oxford and Cambridge each earning
£78,895 and £109,000 respectively
last year.
