Security team get
result on bike thefts
MATTHEW BENNETT
Imperial College Security officials
are celebrating a massive reduction
in campus bicycle thefts, following
improved security vigilance and the
arrest of a suspected thief before
Christmas.
A man was arrested on 11
December after a fourth year Civil
Engineering student noticed two
people, a man and a woman, making
"sawing movements" near bicycles
in Dalby court, behind the Civil
Engineering buildings. He immedi-
ately notified Sherfield security
reception. The couple were identi-
fied and intercepted as they passed
the Sherfield building as security
officers were going to Dalby court to
investigate, but refused to be
detained. In the short struggle that
followed, the man was apprehended
while his female accomplice
escaped. The police were called, and
the man subsequently arrested.
According to the police, this man
has previous convictions for theft.
Security officers on duty at the time
of the incident report that the suspect
was carrying all the equipment nec-
essary to steal a bike, including bolt
cutters.
Upon his arrest, the man alleged-
ly protested that he was only "mak-
ing a metal sofa, and looking for
scrap metal." Nevertheless, he has
been charged with the offence of
"going equipped to steal". The case
will come to court during the next
few weeks. If found guilty, the man
will be sentenced according to his
previous criminal record and individ-
ual circumstances. A man arrested
for attempted theft last year in Weeks
hall was sentenced to four months
imprisonment.
Police later obtained a search war-
rant for the man's house in North
London and discovered he was living
with a girl matching the description
of his accomplice. However, no evi-
dence exists linking her to the inci-
dent, and at present police have no
plans to press charges.
This victory follows a number of
improvements to South Kensington
campus security measures. Foremost
among these have been 'plain
clothes' security patrols, which have
been adopted as standard practice
following their introduction shortly
before Christmas. This and other
measures have seen a drop in bicycle
thefts from around eight per week to
virtually none. No further bike thefts
have been recorded since the end of
January.
Security staff routinely remove
bicycles from certain locations if
they consider them to be causing an
obstruction. IC security currently
holds at least eight bikes removed
from around the College which
remain unclaimed by their owners.
Security officials strongly recom-
mend that students whose bikes are
missing check with Sherfield recep-
tion before assuming them stolen.
Whilst highlighting their crack-
down on bicycle theft, IC's security
service reiterated the difficulties
inherent in maintaining vigilance
given the size of the campus and the
multitude of places that bikes are
sometimes left. The plain clothes
patrols continue, and officials hope
that extra surveillance cameras will
soon be in place.

Doctor! Doctor! IC medical students share a joke over lunch in the Great
Hall before showing visiting sixth-formers around the rest of the campus.
First ICSM open day
attracts brightest pupils
KENT YIP
The first open day for the new
Imperial College School of Medicine
on Tuesday attracted 600 prospective
medical students from some of the
best schools in the country.
Visiting sixth-formers were wel-
comed by the ICSM's new Principal,
Professor Chris Edwards, in the
Great Hall. Prof Edwards immediate-
ly began by highlighting the potential
of the new school, which will inherit
the research excellence of the
National Heart and Lung Institute
and the Royal Postgraduate Medical
School, and the proud tradition of
the two undergraduate medical
schools at St Mary's and Charing
Cross Hospital.
This was followed by an overview
of the new curriculum, which Dr
Rory Shaw, Rector of the Medical
Education Unit, claimed was "Out
with the worst of the old, and in with
the best of the new".
Dr Shaw allayed fears that
prospective medical students might
be used as "guinea pigs" for a new
course, explaining that the new qual-
ification had been designed with con-
siderable input from current students,
whose curriculum already incorpo-
rates part of the new course.
Dr Stan Head, Admissions Tutor,
went on to explain the selection pro-
cedure. Throughout his talk, he
repeatedly stressed the need for can-
didates to be good all-rounders in
order to gain admission into the pres-
tigious new medical school. Dr Head
illustrated the highly competitive
nature of the process using entry sta-
tistics from last year. Of 5,000 appli-
cants to St Mary's and Charing
Cross, only 1 in 5 were called up for
interview, and only 1 in 12 received
an offer. Immediately afterwards, Dr
