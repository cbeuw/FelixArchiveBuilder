the Cupid role, are bending over
backwards to accommodate this spe-
cial interest body of students and
make the marriage work. The
ICSMU, smaller than
RCS, will get as much
funding as all the cur-
rent unions put
together. The B M S
has provision for
social space, a fea-
ture that is some-
what sparse in
every other depart-
ment. This again
will allow the
medics to remain in
their shiny new build
ing without the need
fraternise. The only
we will see them is
Friday night in the
Southside, and God help the conse-
quences.
For reasons best known to them-
selves, medics are a fiercely indepen-
dent bunch the world over. They are
very big on their identity, which is
why they feel they have everything
to lose from this merger. They resent
interference and intrusion by out-
siders, a point that was made all too
clear to me and other IC students last
year when attending lectures at
Mary's. An explanation of
this somewhat fanatical
behaviour was offered
one of the phar-
macology lecturers,
who suggested it
was a school in
every sense of the
word, with greater
cosseting of the
students the result
being that, in his
words, the equiva-
lent age group at IC
were more mature. This
hostility towards IC
xtends to the very highest
levels of the medical schools. In St
Mary's magazine, there have been
letters of complaint from all and
sundry, culminating in an open letter
to the Queen Mother. The only thing
that unites them all is that they don't
want to be united.
As days go by, this is looking
more and more like empire building

Everything seemed fairly quiet on
the medical front a few weeks ago.
The BMS was rising majestically and
on schedule (after a fashion), and lit-
tle had been heard from St Mary's.
Then news came of a deal struck by
ithe medics to secure direct funding
|from College to the tune of £80,000
Iper year. This will indeed further
ialienate the medical students within
jthe body of IC, but that is precisely
| what they want.
I To describe the merger of St
jMary's, Charing Cross, NHLI and
jRoyal Postgraduate medical schools
las a shotgun wedding doesn't even
jcome close to the mark. For anyone
|new to the South Ken campus, let me
jexplain the gist of recent events.
IMary's do not like Imperial, and dis-
llike being reminded of the fact they
| themselves have been part of IC
jsince 1988. Imperial do not like
Mary's. Mary's do not wish to merge
with the other medical schools, and
they in turn want nothing to do with
Mary's IC, or each other. In short,
this is tribal warfare. Since no one
likes anyone else in this shambles,
i College senior management, playing
One area of public spending doesn't
seem attract much interest from stu-
dents, apart from the odd comment
that in a modern society we don't
really need one any more: Britain's
Armed Forces.
The arguments for a serious
rethink on our defence forces are
strong. The annual budget stands at
£24 billion, enough for a quite a lot
of hospitals and schools. It employs a
few hundred thousand people, plus
countless others in industries includ-
ing arms and aeronautics companies.
There will certainly be people read-
ing this who will be going into such
industries themselves. The broad
question of arms is a horrendously
complex one, not made any easier by
the emotional issues attached to it.
Arms companies are usually paci-
fists' and socialists' Enemy No 1,
with the supply of totalitarian and
repressive regimes regarded with jus-
tified disgust - although I wonder
how many people from Imperial who
were offered a highly paid job with
one of them would turn it down for
these reasons.
Labour's Defence Spokesman,
David Clark, has been quietly agree-
ing with most of Government
defence policies. Labour has a politi-
cal legacy including policies for par-
tial or complete destruction of our
nuclear arsenal, swingeing cutbacks
in all three forces, leaving NATO
and so on. This is all now considered
too dangerous, and Labour have
recently kept quiet on the subject.
Clark has said a few things though:
membership of NATO, maintaining
Trident (our nuclear submarine fleet)
and our permanent seat on the U N
Security Council will all be "non-
negotiable".
I believe the general argument for
axing vast portions of the Armed
Forces goes something like this: in a
modern society, we do not need these
weapons of war. No-one is likely to
attack us - we now enjoy close rela-
tions with Germany, the last country
we fought within our borders. But
anyway if they do the United States
will help us out, and we'll keep
something in reserve just in case.
Many people may not say this open-
ly but feel in their heart of hearts that
this is the case.
Unfortunately, the world doesn't
really work like that. Since the col-
lapse of Communism, the standard
East versus West confrontation has
been replaced by a much more com-
plicated situation, with instability
and power vacuums in countless
areas across the world. It is vital that
a country with enormous world inter-
ests such as the U K does not seek
solace in itself - every time relatively
powerful countries become isolation-
ist, ignoring the affairs of others, for-
eign powers will see what they can
get away with. Hitler took over most
of the European continent this way -
Russia invaded Afghanistan this
way, Argentina invaded the
Falklands this way, and the fighting
factions in Bosnia consistently tested
NATO's patience to the limit this
way. I am not arguing that world
order would collapse if we scrapped
a few missiles, but that we must
show the world quite clearly that we
won't watch on the sidelines while
atrocities are committed and islands
and areas of the world under British
rule - who wish to remain British -
are attacked. This clear attitude lies at
the forefront of our nuclear policy.
The world knows that Britain has at
least one submarine afloat with the
capability to launch an attack on any
part of the world at any time. This
would make anyone considering
using chemical or biological
weapons against British troops, or
considering attacking the U K main-
land itself, think twice.
Let us say this or an incoming
Government accepted these broad
terms: how could they cut defence?
Even a 5% cut would release billions
of pounds. Unfortunately they are
by IC. Forget the cost and to hell
with the consequences. The BMS
building amazingly manages to fill
every available square inch, prevent-
ing expansion by anyone else, clear
evidence that it was built on the basis
of getting the largest building that the
planners will allow- stick it up, then
think what to do with it. Only the
Biology department have, to date,
supplied plans of what facilities are
needed. Even by IC standards, this
ain't good.
As you would imagine on a job of
this size, there will be penalty pay-
ments for late completion. Very sen-
sible you say. Oh dear. The penalty
payments are £21,000 per day late.
Not to be paid by Schal to us, mind.
Oh no, this will be paid to the
Treasury by IC. The bloke that came
up with that stunning deal was prob-
ably headhunted from the British
Library project. It will, therefore,
open on time.With the integration of
Charing Cross and the others likely
to be as shambolic as Mary's, pre-
pare for much more chaos. This, as
someone once said, is going to run
and run.
finding it very difficult to cut any-
thing. Trident is practically paid for,
so scrapping it would kill off a major
part of the UK's personal defence
without any pecuniary advantage.
The same can be said of Eurofighter
- an essential project if only to show
that countries other the States are
capable of building hi-tech weapon-
ry. A l l forces have been cut to the
bone, with observers commenting
that we would not have the resources
to launch another Falklands opera-
tion. More adventurous ideas have
been suggested: merging the Royal
Marines with the Army, scrapping
the RAF (!) and merging them with
Naval and Army air arms. We could
lose the tanks - attack helicopters do
the job just fine. We don't need long
range bombers - cruise missiles will
fit the role quite nicely.
Although such suggestions may
cause hernias in defence chiefs and
invite ridicule from various quarters,
tough decisions will have to be made.
Industry bosses and trade unions will
lobby strongly against any cuts, with
some places employing tens of thou-
sands of people on one (albeit large)
site. But even the milder plan for
more European integration could
save £3 -£4 billion pounds annually.
As John Reed of 'Defence Industry'
says: "the risk is that in trying to get
the best of both worlds they will end
up with the worst of both, and that
the real day of decision will be post-
poned."
