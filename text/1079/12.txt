Dear Alex Feakes,
I read with interest your editorial
in Felix 7.2.97. There is no indicaton
that ring-fencing will be of detriment
to ICU funding, it merely allows
Charing Cross and Westminster
Students' Union and our counter-
parts at St Mary's to run the facilities
for students, at their present sites,
who will have no contact with
Imperial College since teaching of
the new course at IC doesn't start
until 1998. Although, Charing Cross
and Westminster Medical School
merges with the established ICSM in
August of this year there will be no
change to student requirements at the
Charing Cross site for the time being.
Ring fenced funding in the interim
period is a perfectly logical solution
to maintaining basic recreational
facilities for students off the IC cam-
pus. If your suggestion is to ignore
the needs of this considerable body
of students I must value your com-
ments for less than the paper they are
written on.
Yours sincerely,
Nitish Singh
President of Charing Cross and
Westminster Medical School SU
Dear Editor,
A couple of weeks back in Felix
(issue 1077), I read the editorial arti-
cle about the library closure and the
rebates received by Weeks Hall resi-
dents.
What gets me, is that the College
may of agreed to rebate the residents,
but to my knowledge they haven't
actually paid out any money. I've
spoken to the person who organised a
petition and was at the forefront of
the fight against the noise, ans she
knows nothing about the rebate!!!
I've put together a few signatures
of key people (petition organisers)
and residents from the lower floors
of Weeks who know nothing about
the rebate, this is to add some weight
to my letter.
Shinri Szymko, Mech Eng II
The letter is then signed by the fol-
lowing:
TR Thompson, RJ Rust, S Cross, D
Haboubi, AR Southern, E Coombs, G
Paesano, P Newton, P Curnow, G
Tucker, James Hodges
Deadline for letters in Felix 1080
is Tuesday 18th February.
Letters may be e-mailed to our

My Funny Valentine
by the increasingly desperate Jon Trout
It is once again that traumatic time
of year when you try to lie about
how many cards you received to
hide your crushing disappointment
whilst all the while thinking: it's
come in the second post, or it'll
come tomorrow, but knowing that if
anyone cared they would have made
sure you got it before you picked up
this copy of Felix, and you know
that if you haven't got one yet, it's
safe to say you're going yet another
year without. This year, I'll have
done the same thing any self respect-
ing young man should. Cheat. Count
the card from your mum. Use last
year's cards from that ex-girlfriend
you said that you would have no
more to do with. And those from the
year before. Tell everyone you got
e-valentines that morning. Walk
around with a smug grin refusing to
reveal how many you got. Claim the
most obscure newspaper Valentine's
message as being a coded epistle of
undying love directed solely at you,
even if this means radically altering
your known life story to date. The
worst thing you can do at this time is
admit defeat, and if this means sacri-
ficing your personal dignity, so be it.
So, that's the morning's lectures
out of the way, and the afternoon
can be survived by pretending to do
work. This leaves Valentine's night,
which for some is more disturbing
than the morning. Those of you
lucky enough to have some kind of
pre-organised tryst need not read on,
but for the rest of humanity, and
those of you who are lying, fear not,
help is at hand. According to a ran-
dom woman in the office, it is
imperative not to spend a sad night
in, cynically avoiding all mention of
Valentine's Day, and playing
Quake/ watching slushy films/ get-
ting skullfucked on cheap wine. No
the solution is to swallow your
rapidly shrinking pride, put on your
finest party clobber and, that's right,
go to the Union, get drunk in the cor-
ner and watch everyone getting off
with each other. No, that's not
right... If you plan, scheme and gen-
erally strain your virgin brow, you
can be one of the deliriously happy
few. Look around you, see the girl
splayed out on the floor by the vend-
ing machine. She's obviously off
her face, sobbing heartbrokenly to
her best mate about never finding
true love and all that girlie bollocks.
Seize your moment, lose the friend,
"talk your meaningless profound
crap" (said the same random office
wench) and abuse your position as
the benevolent knight in shining
armour. The deed is done, you will
get your kicks and she will remem-
ber none of it and probably fall
asleep halfway through.
Happy Valentine's Day.
COMPETITION
For true style points though, it is you
who must do something romantic,
and this is where Felix can help
you...
Those lovely people at IRP
Promotions sent us news of the first
ever "virtual careers fair", which has
been organised by Gradunet for the
26th February. To celebrate this
event, Reuters, the leading global
financial information and news
provider arc giving away two train
tickets to Paris as a prize on a web-
based conip @ www.gradunet.co.uk
Explains Gradunet M D Adam Bass:
"Students can communicate with
employers even if their university
doesn't have a milkround." Right.
Mr Trout has still not got a girl-
friend.
Your chance to influence
university funding
At 6.30 in the Union SCR on Tuesday 18th Feb.
