Felix's regular "external" sports column by the ever tal-
ented and good-looking Dave Robinson.
It was third time lucky for England
cricketers this week as they trounced
the Kiwi's, there is even the slight
possibility we might win an overseas
series if things can be wrapped up
Christchurch. Atherton seems to
have evaded the chop temporarily
and will no doubt walk out for the
toss at Edgcbaston in June, watch out
for Nasser Hussain and Alec Stewart
trying to get him run out. Hopefully
we can build on the last four perfor-
mances to create a side with a hope of
taking The Ashes on this summer.
Since the tests will be contested on
home soil, we won't be suffering
from the usual bout of travel sick-
ness.
As there was no Premiership or
Five Nations last weekend, I was
nearly reduced to a trip to Brighton
for the 'Fans United' match. Fans of
every club in the country inspired
Brighton to put five past Hartlepool
in front of the season's biggest crowd
in the Third Division. Apparently
they had Palace and Mi 1
1wall fans
holding hands, and Newcastle,
Middlesborough and Sunderland
cheering on the same team - amazing
what Brighton can do for male bond-
ing.
This week has already seen a few
World Cup Qualifiers, Scotland came
unstuck when the Estonians managed
to turn up and with Mark Crossley
deputising for the immortal Neville
Southall, Wales managed to keep a
clean sheet against the Irish. As you
read this the result of England's
World Cup Qualification game
against Italy will be known, I've
already had to read about and listen
to people discussing a probable team
over and over again. Judging by how
wrong all my predictions were last!
week I'm not going to have much
luck predicting a team or a score. I
would however expect Hoddle to go
for Shearer and Ferdinand, which
leaves the only decision of whether to
play McManaman or Merson. Both
players have proved that they can be
as effective as Alessandro del Piero
and one will inevitably be disappoint
ed. I would imagine it will be a match
with goals as both sides contain many
flair players willing to have a go, the
extent to which this will be limited
will be decided by Maldini and
Hoddle.
For those who haven't been
enlightened, if England have won
and then go on to win the group they
are assured an automatic place in the
finals. If however they finish second
in the group to the Italians they will
have to play off against another sec
ond placed team from a different
group at a neutral location for a place
in the finals. I said 1 wouldn't predict
but I reckon it was 2-1 to England.
Resurgent fourths surge forth
The scoreline does not reflect story
behind this game, in which the
fourths produced one of the most
tremendous comebacks of the mod-
ern era to win three-two. This truly
was the greatest morale-boosting
victory this season, with a script that
would have pleased The Bard him-
self - at the end of act two we were
down to our lowest ebb and by the
final curtain we were ecstatic.
With only four minutes remaining
we were two-nil down and seeming-
ly set for their first league defeat
since early November, but then we
decided it was time to stop pissing
about and score a few goals. Firstly if
was Ryan who was found in space
by an excellent cross-field ball, fin-
ishing with ease low into the corner.
Goldsmith's then gave the ball away
straight from the kick-off and were
over-run by a great wave of IC pres-
sure. Within seconds a scramble on
the edge of the box led to Adam
blasting home from close range.
Now we were level but still we
wanted more, and in the last minute
we forced a corner which was swung
towards the back post. Gloriously
and majestically a Goldies' defender
soared above the rest of the defence
and directed a perfect header past his
keeper. What a way to complete such
a comeback! Crazy scenes then
ensued with eleven mad footballers
seemingly drunk on happiness all
group-hugging and celebrating this
splendid fightback.
A great end to a day which started
with the IC team causing a bomb
alert at Victoria station, then stupidly
getting off the train at totally the
wrong station, and then at another
station comically and pointlessly
walking around in a big circle around
a council estate looking for a bus
which was actually directly outside
the station. Well done.
IC IV 3 - 2 Goldsmith's III
IC versus a constituent college - this
was a large one! Both teams needed
all three points to keep promotion
hopes alive; Ubogu, IC's early sea-
son signing was facing his old team
for the first time and for
Mary's...well, as much as anything,
it was their cup final.
The game started at a ferocious
pace, Mary's making the early run-
ning, their brash, bruising style
unsettling IC at first and earning
them an early lead.
This spurred "The Slags" into
action. Playing slightly deeper IC
found the space to pass the ball neat-
ly about and carve holes in the
Mary's rearguard. Imperial had held
the upper hand for a rosy fifteen
minute spell when Reed lofted a
searching ball towards the fiesty
Archbald. The defender made a good
interception but tenacious tackling
from the twinkle-toed terrier forced
the error - the defender could only
clear as far as Fleming just inside the
Mary's half. With the luxury of a lit-
tle space he controlled the ball on his
chest. It fell to the ground and
bounced once. Seeing the Mary's
keeper was off his line, he struck it
from thirty-five yards. Immediately
the keeper was struggling and
despite his six foot two frame could-
n't get a hand to it. The ball bounced
On a bad day for the IC football
teams, R S M seconds reminded
everyone that it is possible to win
with style and plenty of hi-jinx.
RSM dominated the game from
kick-off to the final whistle - the first
half saw Martin drive home an eigh-
teen yard shot leaving the deeper
helpless, Si quickly followed with an
An overcast February afternoon saw
the coming together of the masses of
IC's bar staff. As the sides assembled
the numerical advantage was defi-
nitely with the Southers.
Unperturbed by this (and the weight
advantage) the heroes of the Union
went to their task.
After an unsteady beginning
Dimitri the traitor, who was moon-
lighting from his secret life in Basics,
put on home for the union.
Southside's supporters, encouraged
by whisky and vodka, then raised
their team and Barney surged down
the wing and slipped one past the
stranded union goalie. The union
then fought back and won a free-
just before the goal-line and hit the
roof of the net. 1-1 and a goal of the
season contender. IC came close
again through Reed with a blistering
shot going narrowly wide after
strong run and a tidy one-two with
Schroeder.
On thirty-six minutes the com-
plexion of the game changed again.
Big Vern made a timely challenges
on the marauding Mary's attackers
and the ball became loose in mid-
field. It was immediately contested
between the Mary's centre half and
the galloping Ubogu. This Mary's
man came off worse and the medics
had an assignment for the week as he
was stretchered off the pitch.
The delay, however, served
Mary's better than Imperial as it had
come in the middle of a purple patch
for "The Slags," and they found it
difficult to get back in their stride.
The second half was a case of
swashbuckling defending and in this
respect Finn and Shanidze excelled.
Their lunges, lurches, leching, lin-
gering and lovely linking looked
like...ace-brill, and with keeper
Keane cool as a cat kicking cold cab-
bages we deserved to hold the fort.
Malheuresement with ten minutes to
go Mary's grabbed a late winner and
the points.
IC II 1 - 2 St Mary's
almost as impressive goal. The sec-
ond half saw R S M reduced to ten
men when Craig was carried off with
a fractured knee cap.. King's got one
back when a long ball from midfield
lobbed the keeper - nice on big
Rodger! Si sealed the game with his
second goal.
RSM II 3 - 1 King's Hospital
kick. Gerry's precise lob hypnotised
the keeper and the union were back
in front. A perfect cross let Justin in
for a thumping header to allow the
union to go in leading three-one at
half time.
Southside came out looking like a
different team. Intense pressure led
to goals from Nick, Barney and
Ewan to put them up four-three and
seemingly in control. Nothing could
deny the union, however, as they
stepped up a gear with Dimitri scor-
ing one and Jason two to finish the
match off. The boat-race was won
easily by Southside - at least they can
do something.
