Fair fares derailed by Underground privatisation
ALOK JHA
Speculation that London
Underground is to be privatised has
intensified this week, following a
report that it may be sold whole to a
single company. This might lead to
fare increases and scotch plans to
introduce cheaper fares for students.
An article in Monday's edition of
The Independent claims that the sub-
terranean rail system could be sold
off as a 'job lot', possibly as early as
March, before the general election.
London Underground has as yet
made no official announcement
regarding privatisation plans,
although a spokesperson claims that
the organisation has submitted a doc-
ument to the Department of
Transport outlining a number of
approaches. The contents of the pro-
posal remain confidential, and both
sides have adopted a policy of
silence.
London Underground operates
tube services on behalf of London
Transport, which has expressed its
intention to remain neutral through-
out the process. LT claims it wishes
only to ensure that whoever buys the
network maintains the correct safety
and security measures.
Privatising the tube network,
according to the Government, is
expressly aimed at improving the ser-
vice to customers (formerly passen-
gers). However, projects that LT was
hoping to carry out in the near future
must now be shelved until a satisfac-
tory outcome to the sell-off has been
achieved. One these postponed pro-
jects is the refurbishment of stations

at the southern end of the Northern
Line. Although new trains will soon
be introduced to the line, delays will
remain as tracks and signalling will
not be upgraded. Hidden costs such
as these will have to be met by the
network's new owner.
Should privatisation be given the
green light, the future of London
Transport itself remains unclear. As
the sole administrator of the capital's
public transport, LT is able to issue
tickets and travelcards valid for both
buses and trains. As yet, there is no
guarantee that a private investor
would continue this regime.
Similarly, were the network to be
divided up, it is unclear whether a
ticket bought at a station owned by
one company would be valid for trav-
el on lines owned by another.

of the London Underground, and the
After the privatisation, London
Transport will not continue to control
any transport services. The organisa-
tion might survive in an advisory or
regulatory capacity, possibly acting a
consultant for the tube's eventual
owners.
Whoever buys London's under-
ground network will need to invest
an estimated £1.2 billion immediate-
ly, to cover essential repairs and
maintenance. The burden of such an
investment could be lightened if the
Government pours money into the
system before selling, as it has in
some previous privatisations. Paul
Bates, University of London Union
Welfare Officer, predicts that if a pri-
vate buyer is forced to make a mas-
sive initial investment, the result may
be a sharp increase in fares and
increased hardship for students.
Speaking to Felix, Mr Bates
explained that he "....cannot believe
that anyone would want to buy the
underground system. Shareholders
would not get a return on such an
under-invested scheme."
Believing that an increase in fares
would hit students particularly hard,
ULU has been exploring ways of
obtaining discounts for its members.
ULU's President last year, Ghassan
Karrian, attempted to negotiate a deal
with London Transport in which
University of London students would
receive a 25% discount on tube fares.
LT agreed to test the scheme and set
up a pilot project for the students of
Queen Mary's and Westfield
College. According to Paul Bates,
London Underground's imminent
privatisation has derailed the scheme.
It has been removed from U L U con-
trol and now faces an uncertain
future.
A student representative at Queen
Mary's and Westfield College
explained that the scheme had been
very popular with students, but that it
was "...down to London Transport
whether or not it was successful."
London Transport believes that the
long-term success of such a discount
scheme could be guaranteed at the
time of privatisation, by including it
as a contractual obligation to be ful-
filed by the network's new owner or
owners. Unfortunately, such a deci-
sion will be made during discussions
between LT and the new buyer,
where student interests are unlikely
to be represented.
A U T vote for
pay deal
ALOK J H A
With a turnout of 64.9%, members
of the Association of University
Teachers voted with an overwhelm-
ing 92.3% majority to accept their
latest pay offer and end all industrial
action. 99.2% of the union also
voted to set up a new pay review
body. These results, announced on
Wednesday, mean that pay will be
increased by 2.9% backdated to last
April and remain at that level in the
next financial year. Technical, man-
ual and ancillary staff will also
receive a rise of 2.8%.
Acording to Chris Moss, A U T
representative at IC, the increase
showed that they had been particu-
larly hard done by during the whole
process.

Sainsbury's store on Cromwell Road. Where good food costs less?
JACKIE S K E A T E
Leading retail chain Sainsbury's has
been ranked fourth out of five in a
survey of food quality in leading
supermarket stores.
For Sainsbury's, whose flagship
Cromwell Road store is popular
among Imperial College students,
this is further blow follows the
announcement that their profits
would be £60 million lower than
expected, causing their share price to
fall by 13%. Sainsbury's have seen
their dominant market position over-
taken by Tesco, and last year saw
their profits fall for the first time.
The survey, conducted by the
Epicurean World Master Chefs'
Society, placed Sainsburys beneath
Waitrose, Tesco, and Safeways, but
above Asda.
