UNFORTUNATE EPISODE MAPS FRESHERS' NIGHT
At 11 o'clock on the night of the f i r s t R.C.S. Freshers' dinner, a baby
was found i n the middle of the Union quadrangle. The President of the Union
and the Warden of the Hostel quickly arrived on the scene and supervised the
removal of the baby, whose name i s believed to be Austin, to Prince Consort
Head, where i t was l e f t for the night. By the following morning i t had dis-
appeared. Several such episodes have occurred recently; i t i s reported that
steps are being taken to discourage the offenders.
Earlier i n the evening the E.C.S.
Freshers' dinners got off to a roaring
start, the l i v e l y and enthusiastic atmos-
phere being marred only by "a couple of
shockingly weak stories, which were, how-
ever, dealt with i n suitable manner. The
dinner i t s e l f was of a high standard,
and this was maintained by J*. Ifconey for
the following nights.
Speaking at Wednesday's dinner, Br.
Atkinson counselled freshers to exercise
great care i n choosing digs. He himself
had found (later, he said) that M B land-
lady was running a house of ill-repute.
Advice on this matter could be had from
tutors.
A bout of lusty singing i n the Bar
on Thursday was terminated when some
Miners present challenged B.C.S. to a
'game' of buk-buk. The design of the Bar
proved ideal for this purpose, and the
R.C.S. men equal to the occasion, troun-
cing both the Mines and Guilds teams
twice. The Scientists were then also v i c -
torious i n a boat-race Khngellal
On Friday tne R.C.S. women descen-
ded en masse on the Upper Dining Hall.
In her speech, Was Haywood said that Mr.
Butters had given her only one hour's
notice, and this had quite spoiled her
dinner. To rectify this small matter, she
suggested that Mr. Butters should take
her out to dinner. They were later seen
comparing diaries.
FRESHERS GUILDED
In a characteristically happy atmos-
phere, the r i t u a l Guilds Freshers dinners
were held In the Upper Dining B a l l on
five evenings last week.
For the f i r s t three evenings, Pres-
ident Dave Stevens took the chair, before
succumbing to the dreaded ' f l u . On the
other two evenings the chair was taken by
Tioe President John Sheldon. ( A l l tbe
chairs were eventually recovered).
The President's speech contained the
usual advice and adÂ»nishaent to be heard
on this occasion, although his scathing
comments on brownbagging and personal
dress were i n a rather more serious vein.
As of yore, the after-dinner speakers
said absolutely nothing i n a highly amus-
ing fashion, ending with their usual
'jokes'. Age old gambits were employed:
"Mr, President, Gentlemen and Chemical
Engineers...." (cheers, groans and genesal
disorder). When the speakers were dry, the
Spanner was shown to the freshers, the
"Boomalaka" rendered with great gusto, and
the adjournment moved to the usual place.
The singing i n the Bar was of a very
lusty nature, being remarkable for i t s
volume, quality (I) and v e r s a t i l i t y .
Accounts of after events are naturally
incoherent, seeming to indicate that ex-
tensive inebriation was attained with un-
f a i l i n g consistently.

The seeond part of the Karakoram ex-
pedition team has now returned to England.
At an exclusive FELIX-PHOENIX interview,
our reporter was able to talk to Mr. Erie
Shipton, the leader of the expedition and
a very experienced explorer and mountain-
eer who has taken part i n several Everest
expeditions, and has established a strong
reputation for work that he has previously
done i n the Karakoram.
The idea behind the expedition was to
build i n the College a nucleus of men with
experience of exploration who would be
leaders of further expeditions, a l l with
the same object of Scientific Investigation
of "new" territory. In t h i s , Mr. Shipton
said, the expedition had been entirely suc-
cessful. Although the party was very young
and had had comparatively l i t t l e previous
experience, they made up for this by their
keenness and enthusiasm. Indeed, there had
been f a r less f r i c t i o n than he had ever
known before on an expedition.
Unfortunately, the expedition was de-
layed for three weeks, which were v i r t u a l l y
wasted, by the non-arrival of their baggage,
and later on the weather became very bad;
daily snowfalls hampered them considerably.
The baggage apparently arrived outside
Bombay harbour three weeks before the ex-
pedition, but i t was not possible to get
i t ashore for six weeks'. This state of
affairs appears to be quite usual i n Bom-
bay, and i t i s quite inconceivable that
the College agents did not know of i t . I f
the expedition had been informed, they
could probably have taken their equipment
along with them, but they were taken com-
pletely unawares.

In order to reach the scene of op-
erations,the Siechen glacier, the party
had to cross an 16,000' pass. One of the
strange sights they aaw was an eagle, ap-
parently exhausted, also crossing the past
on foot.

Wednesday distinguished i t s e l f with
an attesnit by several obstreperous B.C.S.
men to whisk away the Spanner, but thanks
to the instantaneous reflexes of a prom-
inent member of the Guilds' staff, their
effort was i n vain. One of the bandits
was seised; he ended the evening with
nothing but a shirt to eover his
rasssmnt.
Several incidents by a minority oar-
red the f e s t i v i t i e s . On Thursday fireworks
were thrown i n the lounge, while on Friday
chairs were thrown about in the lounge aria
damaged, and glasaes were thrown against
the ceiling. Drunkezmeaa i s no excuse for
vandalism. I t l a incredible that i n an
University, where people profess to bo ed-
ucated, such hooligan behaviour should
occur.
