THE REFECTORY
SITUATION
"The College refectories are now
Barring approximately 1500 lunches d a i l y ,
an increase of 450 over the corresponding
figure a year ago! This surprising fact
was disclosed by s r . Ifconey, I.C, Refect-
ory Manager, i n an exclusive interview
with FEUS reporters. Mr. Mooney pointed
out that the kitchens i n the Onion are
now turning out 1000 lunches daily, as
against 500 last October, The inadequacy
of the kitchens and s t a f f shortages are
the two main problems facing the Refect-
ory today.
WHERE DO THET GOT
On analysis, the number of lunches
served dally i n the Loser Refectory i s
500, the same as last year. The Upper
Dining H a l l and Upper Refectory, neither
of whioh was i n operation last year, are
now serving 400-500 between them. Against
t h i s , there has been a slight drop i n
Queenie's, from 600 d a l l y to about 530.
The kitchens i n Queenie's, however, are
far larger than those i n the Union. The
refrigerator space, f o r instance, i s four
times the size.
PRICES
It i s being found necessary to raise
prices s l i g h t l y . The refectories lost
money last year. As a result of this and
increased payments to staff, there w i l l
be fewer 1/9 dishes available, f o r ex*
ample, and the prices of special dinners
are also being raised. The refectory wage
b i l l i s now 30% higher than i t was a year
ago, and the income has to follow suit.
As members of the Union w i l l have
observed, prices are i n rather a state
of flux at the moment. The profit needed
to cover wages and overheads i s 40% of
the oost price of the food. I f this be
exceeded, the prices w i l l be reduced ac-
cordingly. However, i n the oase of the
Cornish Pasty, the fluctuations between
1/9 and 2/0 are governed by the oonte'nts,
and not by the slide—rule computations
of the cashier.
HOT OR COLD?
The most unfortunate feature of the
kitchens i n the Union Is the perpetual
draught that whistles through, and Is
partly responsible f o r the rapid cooling
of food when i t Is removed from the ovens.
(The 297 is also a non-starter on Sat-
urday, unfortunately.) If the "Gyre sad
tumble? Just off T i m e r s Street, is
s t i l l open, you ean always drop in for
a cup of ooffee.

If something does go wrong, the

of Clapham .Crtsmen and over the Albert
Mage.

I t i s a result of the design of the k i t -
chens: i t cannot be eradicated — only
mitigated. In an effort to do t h i s , new
methods of keeping the food warm are
constantly being t r i e d . One infra-red
heater has already been installed; the
purchase of another i s contemplated.
HOW TOU CAN HELP
One of the ways i n which you can
aid the e f f i c i e n t running of the refect-
ories i s simply by not removing their
cutlery and crockery. The losses last
year were Immense, and much was not re-
covered — i t a l l contributes to the
r i s e i n prices. Mr. Mooney has also
been aggrieved lately by the disappear-
ance of pepper-pot-tops — i t should be
perfectly possible to obtain the goods
through the apertures provided.
We discovered that not even Mr.
Mooney knows what goes into the Mul-
ligatawny soup. On being asked, he
smiled his enigmatic smile:"Tour guess
i s as good as mine. We t r y to make the
food interesting?
WINE TASTING SOCIETY
The first, meeting of the Session was
well attended - too well,in fact, 70
people being present, llany latecomers
were refused admittance as both sherry
and seating were insufficient f o r a
greater number.
Mr. MsKenzie, who lectured at the
inaugural meeting of the Society, intro-
duced the tasting with an informative
lecture on the production of sherry.
He emphasised the special system of
blending the wines - the Solera system
- which ensures a continuity of style,
quality and age.
Four kinds of sherry were tasted:
Manzanilla Finn (a dry wine with a
salty tang)
Amontillado (a young and old variety)
Oloroso (a very sweet wine)
the special characteristics of each
being indicated by the speaker.
Several l i v e l y questions terminated
the aeeting.
The next meeting w i l l be on Oct. 29th
when I t a l i a n wines w i l l be tasted.
