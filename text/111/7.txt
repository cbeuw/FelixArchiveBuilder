A new society i s coming into existence

here a long time, out of contact with one
another, and sometimes out of sympathy.
The Church Society i s to provide a
meeting ground f o r members of the Church
of England, and other members of the
Anglican Communion, and anyone else who
wishes to ask questions or j o i n discussion.
At present the society meets i n Holy
T r i n i t y Church, but hopes to transfer to
I,C. Union.
Programme; Wed, 8,3o a.m. Holy Communion
Thurs. 1.20-2 p.m. t a l k by

BOA T CLUB
On Sat. last an I.C. crew with only
3 weeks training together competed f o r
the Sabin Cup. Having possibly a slight
disadvantage i n the Surrey station, they
put up a good fight , rowing w e l l ,
against a better crew, losing by 1 lengths
to Gladstone, eventual winners from
Ibis (2i lengths),who had beaten Lens-
bury (3 lengths) i n a previous heat.

Y.H.A. RAMBLE
The f i r s t outing of the I.CY.H.A.
t h i s term took the form of a day t r i p
to Flatford M i l l , and was arranged i n
conjuction with Bedford College. Twenty
adx people, including freshers from both
colleges, spent a l e i s u r e l y day on
or near the r i v e r .
Soon after 8 p.m. the excursion
t r a i n l e f t F l a t f o r d with most of the party
on board; i t was assumed that the day
was over. However, twenty minutes l a t e r
the t r a i n came to an abrupt s t a n d s t i l l ,
and the party were informed that the
engine had a broken con-rod. The
revellers then proceeded t o amuse them-
selves f o r three hours.
Various accounts have been given as
to now the time was spent. Some found
t h e i r way to the buffet and sang; some
just sat and chattered, and some carried
on with the good work (?) The t r a i n
arrived back i n London at 1.20 a.m., and
several women were locked out of t h e i r
hostels. I t i s reported that they were
forced to spend the rest of the morning
i n a l o c a l police station. A good time
was had by a l l (doubtless J) and the
accident d i d nothing to spoil the outing.

SWIMMING
Prospects f o r this session are very
promising for both swiaming aad water
polo.
Most of last year's awimndag team ars
s t i l l at I.C. and have been strengthened
by the a r r i v a l of D.Beckett who has
represented U.L.. P.Hilis has returned
good times for breastroke and w i l l stake
a strong claim to a place i n the team.
The polo team has settled down well aad
Includes a fresher, R.Basham, who w i l l
strengthen tha shooting power i n front
of goal. The second team w i l l consist
chiefly of l a s t year's players end th*
t h i r d team mainly of freshers?
The prise saying of the week:-
" I've had my copy of the Fresh-
er's FELIX a l l this time and I
haven't had time to read I t yet."
Let us hope that he t r i e s to keep
more up to date with the news than
this suggests.
oooooooooooo
Freshers' dinners are excellent
means of i n i t i a t i n g the new members
of the College into Union l i f e . By
a l l means have a good time, and enjoy
yourselves, but not at the expense
of other members' comfort. When i t
comes to the sordid state of-a cer-
t a i n gentleman being seen i n the Union
Lounge at llp.m, slumped i n a chair
and surrounded by broken glasses i t
begins to make you wonder just what-
ever Is coming to the College now-
adays.
oooooooooooo
The refectory i s now running out of
milk far earlier than i t used to.
Sales have increased out of a l l re-
cognition recently. Is this a re-
f l e c t i o n on the age of freshmen
entering I.C. or just a revulsion
against the alternatives of stewed
tea and sludge-like coffee.
oooooooooooo
We read elsewhere of the nefarious
habits of someone i n the Gymnasium
Changing Room. This i s an example
of straight theft but the other day
a case of larceny was found and the
c u l p r i t , when admonished, appeared
to have no excuse to offer. We hope
he has now recovered from his violent
stomach disorder, and that the re-
t r i e v i n g by the Union of their r o l l
of semi-transparent paper did not
prove too uncomfortable for him.
oooooooooooo
NELSON thanks Mr. David Briggs for
his kind and benevolent donation of
a suggestions book to the Lower Ref-
ectory. Reading the f i r s t week's
contributions, one Is struck by the
appearance yet again of the signatures
of several regular contributors. Let
us hope that some of their well-
meaning comments are acted upon, and
that the "Tripe and Onions' petition
gains momentum.
oooooooooooo
I »C .Hops axe supposed to be informal,
This does not mean going In your d i s -
reputable work-a-day clothing as some
people have been doing. Why don't
you support your College and wear a
blazer? Last Saturday the extremists
went too far the other way, several
gentlemen going In dinner Jackets.
We a l l agree this looks smart but i s
this showy behaviour r e a l l y wanted
at a hop ?.
oooooooooooo
KELSON wishes to bring to the notice
of a l l persons that smoking at the
refectory counter Is both unpleasant
and nauseating, and asks everyone to
desist from this habit.
oooooooooooo
Freshers i n the Fish Tanki-
Lsst week the second instalment
of f i s h arrived In the ICWARIUM.
oooooooooooo
I t has oont to our notice that the
Ladles changing rooas In tha Gym.
cannot be looked. Matters caas to
a head recently when BX1TS CL0TRTJK5
was found i n the Ladles' boudoir.
