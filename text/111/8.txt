12th. was again won by Loughborough but
the I.C. team improved by one position
to f i n i s h third with L.SX. runners
up. The individual times of the I.C.
team were very consistent and a great
improvement on last year, which would
have resulted i n second position, but

on the f o r t h leg by M, Batty of L.S.E.

Wed. SOth. v. Borough Boad (H)
The Club has made a good start to
the season, having won a l l but two of the
s i x games to date. Last Saturday's opp-
onents Old Dun3tablians, are a formidable
club and I.C.'s three wins indicate a good
season to come.
No less than seven of the dub's
freshers are junior county players, and
they should rejuvenate the old lags. Their
s p i r i t and enthusiasm appear t o be excel-
lent.
At the recent dub meeting Dave
Rees was elected Hon. Sea, and Dick Stan-
ton Hon. Fixtures Sec.

Captain'a request to players:- I f swadJL-
abla, please t i c k o f f early i n the week.
The soccer club has mads an excellent
start to the season. With a large number
of keen players,five teams have been f i e l d -
ed on a l l but one occasion and the f i r s t
results have been most encouraging. In
two weeks the club has played nineteen
matches, winning seventeen, drawing
one and losing one with a goals t a l l y
of 87 against 35.
The f i r s t XI has won a l l i t s mat-
ches to date. The results have been
achieved because the team has played
effective f o o t b a l l . At most times the
defence has played soundly, covering well,
and tackling hard, and there has been a
good understanding with the goalkeeper,
Ths forwards have combined w e l l , gener-
a l l y kept the play open and have accepted
most of their chances. The link-up between
defence and forwards has been adquate
but this oan be improved i f the forwards
move into open spaces and c a l l for the b a l l .
The defensive clearances have been safe but
not particularly constructive.
Oct.9th. v. L.S.E. (friendly)
Won 4-1. Goalscorers:- Young, 2 pen.,
Wenk, Pidgeon.
Oct.12th. v. Catford Wanderers l s t .
Won 8-0 (Wenk 2, Young 2, Paddle 2,
Codling 2).
Oct.16th. v. Westminster College (U.L.
League). Won 4-2. (Young, Wenk,
Paddle, Crievson).
Oct.19th. v. St.Mark and St.John College.
Won 6-3. (Wenk 2, Paddle 2, Ryan,
Iborhouse).
While there has been much attention to
the performances of the 1st X I , i t must be
pointed out that the lower teams are sor*
than holding their own. In one match
the f i f t h team scored 15 goals.
Special mention must be made of the
4th. XI under the d i c t a t o r i a l oaptalnoy
of that genial Geordle giant, Arthur
S h i l l i n g . This team , i s firmly at the top
of the 4th. d i v i s i o n of the Inter-eollsgiate
league with a 100% record. As the team
narrowly missed promotion l a s t year 1: Is
hoped that i t w i l l maintain I t s r *«*•
and remain at the top of the &1' .tin".
