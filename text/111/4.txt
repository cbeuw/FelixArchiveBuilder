PRACTICAL POLITICS
FELIX i s a non-political newspaper.
No-one t e l l s us what to p r i n t , and we
hare no party axe to grind. We would
rather stand aloof, and examine the pol-
i t i c a l world with a completely open mind,
as i f surveying the moon through a mam-
moth telescope, ascertaining the facts
objectively and basing our opinions ac-
cordingly.
Let us, then, turn our mammoth
telescope on the latest p o l i t i c a l de-
velopment i n the University. Some pam-
phlets have recently been distributed
In I.C. and other colleges by the Nat-
ional Guardian Ifcvement. At the same
time, there appeared i n SENNET a front
page leader on tho subject of this
movement.
In the pamphlets that have appear-
ed i s advertised a meeting to commem-
orate "The 40th. Anniversary of the des-
truction of a Democracy1
! Let us ask
exactly what was destroyed i n October
1917.
In SENNET we read:n
After a l l this
we s t i l l could not discover how the
organisation can j u s t i f y i t s claim that
23* of the lecturers are Communist but
with such a charming set-up as we hare
here, who cares?" Let us ask what they
did to f i n d out, as well as what the
hauls of the original statement i s .
Do these quotations indicate an
objective and unbiased point of view?
What were the readers meant to think?
Let us resolve not to be led by the
nose, but to THINE FOE OURSELVES.

The time goes very fast. The 23rd.
of October i s the f i r s t anniversary
of the Hungarian Revolution. Nearly a
year has passed, though i t seems that i t
happened only yesterday. Recalling our
memories, there are two main points
to think about .
From one hand we thank the free world
for t h e i r moral support of our struggle
against the ruthless suppression of
our freedom and independence, and for
the economic a i d and hoapility.
From the other hand; some time passed
and the Hungarian problem was not a
headline any more. The refugees found
new homes, started new l i v e s . A small
but enthusiastic group of the newcomers
t r i e d to pick up the western way of l i f e
at the famous I.C. Hostel (starting with
the sherry party at I.C.W.A.). After
a few any steps they became quite familiar
with the Union f a c i l i t i e s (including
the bar, hops, the dropping of milk
bottles etc).
But while enjoying the wonderful,
freedom and democracy of this country, one
must not forget that l i f e i s not the same
for everyone i n the world.

Remember, remember, the 5th of Nov-
ember — at the time of going to press
i t seems l i k e l y that there w i l l again
this year be a bonfire and hop at Har-
lington, with coach transport from the
Union provided.
Other events of a social nature
scheduled for this term are the Guilds
Carnival (Nov.22nd), on an Ancient Greek
theme this year, we hear; the Mines B a l l
w i l l be held a week l s t e r , on the 29th,
and FELIX'S own birthday hop w i l l take
place on the 30th.
Morphy Day i s on November 4th this
year. Mines w i l l be defending the Mbrphy
oup, and Guilds the Lowry. I t i s hoped
that as many members as possible w i l l
travel down to Putneyto support their
respective teams and drown their r i v a l s .
SHIPTON PRAISES I.C, MEN (cent.)
The Siechen glacier, the biggest i n
the world outside Polar regions, has been
v i s i t e d only twice before, and very l i t t l e
i s known about I t , The party s p l i t up into
groups, which each carried out various
geological and other s c i e n t i f i c invest-
igations. They were helped by eight local
men, who carried equipment.
The medical member of the expedition,
Dr. Graham Budd, had l i t t l e i n the way of
sickness or injury to deal with, apart
from a oase of stomach disorder. Lying i n
his tent, the invalid would start to mut-
ter " I must get out; and then a moment
later: " I t ' s too late1
;
Any highlights? Brian Amos hung up-
side down i n a crevasse for about an hour
before the others could p u l l him out, and
then they spent the rest of the day re-
covering his load, which he had dropped
on to a ledge. Entertainment was a l l home-
made, of course. Pete Grimley'a extensive
song repertoire was called upon, while for
the benefit of the local people, E r i c him-
self performed the Charleston.
A l l i n a l l , a valuable and enjoyable
expedition. But, as Mr. Shipton, pointed
out, " i t ' s very much of a continuous
thing? I t must be followed up soon so
that the experience gained i s not wasted
as far as the College i s oonoerned.
SALVATION
My dear Editor,
Over the past year I have
examined the many philosophies offered by
the religious, p o l i t i c a l and other soc-
i e t i e s of the Imperial College, but none
of them has been able to answer my quest-
ions, to offer the secret of a happy,
useful existence, the ultimate purpose and
drive behind human endeavour. I t would
seem that we have become so sophisticated,
so out of touch with the good mother earth,
that we must run blindly from a r t i f i c i a l
stimulant to o f f i c i a l boredom, regency
architecture and potato crisps. I think, I
hope (and who would dare to claim mors i n
this unbalanced and crisis-ridden world)
that I Lave, i n my personal meditations,
found what may, after a l l , be the f i n a l
salvation of mankind. Ws must, i n some
measure, look back to our happy, uncom-
plicated, arboreal culture.
Those who are Interested i n the re-
discovery of t h i s , our heritage, may find
out more about the proposed "I.C. Tree
Climbing Society" from me, through the
Union Rack,
I am, s i r ,

Dear S i r ,
How can the Hugger Club hope that
their F i r s t team w i l l be as stronc- as
ever i f they are going to decrease the
number of players in the team from f i f -
teen to eleren.
We can only hope that their optimism
w i l l make up for this lack of numbers.
Yours f a i t h f u l l y ,
Jennifer Heywood,
President, I.C.W.A.
Noellne Cowgill,
President, I.C.W.S.C.
