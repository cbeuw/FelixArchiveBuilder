JOCK WALLACE
Jock i s one of the two Wallaces on
the Mines Executive (not to be con-
fused with Brian who i s the Secretary).
He spent most of his childhood i n India
with his parents and was educated at
prep, school and Oundle. At Oundle he
learnt among other things to row. They
must have taught him pretty well as he
stroked the f i r s t Eight i n his f i r s t
year i n College, and i n his second he
was Captain of I.C. boats.
To hia many accomplishments he has
recently added that of being able to
drive that prehistoric monster, Clem-
entine; his o f f i c i a l chariot. He hopes
that he w i l l not be called on to drive
her when he gets married next summer.
When asked about his l i k e s and dis-
likes he said, " I l i k e the Tuba to be
PLAXSD, and I do not l i k e young ladies
who ask me i f I am a Minesman". He
also l i s t s "Hops" among his dislikes
( I believe he meant the "dance" type
hop, not the type which i3 fermented. )
DAVE STEVENS
The President of Guilds, known to
a l l as Dave, was at the time of being
interviewed lying i n bed having suc-
cumbed to the Lurgi. This was very un-
fortunate as he v/as striken down i n the
midst of Guilds Fresher's Dinners.
He has played squash for I.C. but
has given i t up thi3 year. I t i s re-
collected that towards the end of last
year everyone he met was greeted by the
cry of "Have you played squash?" I f the
answer was i n the affirmative then he
exhorted the subscription from the poor
unfortunate.
Bo', his o f f i c i a l chariot, i s caus-
ing a l i t t l e worry at the moment. W i l l
both cylinders be f i r i n g when she attempts
to go to Brighton?. That i s the 64,000
question. When, with his coat of many
stripes, he s i t s i n her i t should be
quite a magnificent sight.
He feels that some mention should be
made of his fiancee, Judy, whose latest
claim to fame i s the reclaiming of the
Spanner at the beginning of the session,
having followed an arduous t r a i l round
London's main line stations.
Tubas played on Sundays, and I.C.men
wearing jeans, sweaters and gaudy socks
to College are among his pet dislikes.

DEREK BUTTERS
Derek, who i s President of H.C.S. this
year, has worked his way up from the
bottom. Last year he was Hon. Sec. and
a very hard-working one at that. When
not busy being President he relaxes play-
ing golf, rather l i k e a more elderly
President. His handicap, when he i s cn
form and hitting the b a l l straight, i s 12.
I f he cannot h i t a stationary golf b a l l
straight the writer has d i f f i c u l t y i n
visualising Derek getting his hockey
colours for R.C.S.
He i s i n the Chemistry department,
and i s lucky i n having l e f t the last
of the exams behind over a year ago.
He i s doing research at the moment into
the behaviour of detonators when heated
to 200° C. According to his latest
statement they do not often explode.
"Tubas should only be played by
Gerard Hoffnung* were his last words
as I l e f t .
RICHARD GARNETT
Rich, our gay handsome Union Secretary,
i a going to be i n f o r a heavy time this
year.both academically and i n the Union.
There seems to be more to getting a D.I.C.
than he originally thought. However he
i s used to hard work having been Chairman
Of the Entertainments Committee last year,
and despite this getting a 1st. i n Mining.
When he has finished here he hopes to go
to Canada,where about a year ago he found
gold lying about i n a mine waiting f o r
him to take i t .
During the last three years he has
played rugger for various teams i n th-
College, but he i s afraid that he can-
not find time this year.
Among his dislikes are cliques and
men who play tubas at night.
JENNIFER HEYWOOD
Jennifer, the President of I.C.V/.A.
for those who do not know her, i s in t
t h i r d year of her Physics course (her
fourth year i n College). She seems t-
be doing some interesting courses at
the moment which involve Engineering
Drawing i n the Guilds one afternoon a
week, and glass blowing. She says till
t h i s i s almost certainly her f i n a l yea
here, which seems to confirm our opinii
that there may be a man looming large
on the horizon.
In the line of sport she has repre-
sented I.C.W.S.C. at badminton, 3quash,
netball, tennis and table tennis, aa
well aa leading I . C . A . i n that gran*?
old sport of waterthrowing. On this
l a t t e r activity the following statemer i
waa secured - " F i r s t floor people can
use the balcony i n safety as long as
they act i n accordance with our prin-
ciples.
When questioned cn I.C.W.A. policy f o r
this year she said that they intend to
stay where they are and enjoy their beau-
t i f u l f i s h tank.
Among her dislikes are men who play
tubas.
Have you ever taken a g i r l out for
an evening, then taken her home, and
found yourself stranded, miles from your
own bed, with no transport on hand but
your feet? From the sad tales that reach
our ears we gather that this i s not an
infrequent occurrence. So, i n order to
save.you time and trouble, to t e l l where
you may or may not go, and how far (geo-
graphically speaking), we present the
Lw.
g l o b e t r o t t e r s ' g u i d e
In this series we shall detail the
aeans of getting back to I.C. and a l l
points central from those out-lying parts
i n whioh women are wont to have their
habitat.
F U R Z E D O W N S.W.I 7
Pursedown Training College i s s i t -
uated one mile from the nearest Under-
ground station, which i s Tooting Broad-
way. The last north-bound train leaves
at 12:11 a.m., Monday to Saturday.
Allowing 8 minutes for the mlle(the
author has been known to do i t In 7:50)
and 30 seca. f o r the descent to the
platform, farewells must be concluded"
by 12:02} a.m. The booking clerk i s a
very decent chap and w i l l probably l e t
you right through, but i n order to allow
for the t r a i n being early, you are advised
to leave another 30 sees, or to clearance.
This t r a i n connects with the last Ealing
train from Charing Cross, and w i l l get you
back to I.C. by 1 o'clock.
Should you miss the 12:11, however,
we recommend the following course of act-
ion. Take the f i r s t available south-bound
train to South Wimbledon (4 mins.). Go
along Barton Road, opposite the station,
u n t i l you reach the Broadway, then turn
l e f t . Keep going u n t i l you come to Wim-
bledon station. The total distance i s
about a mile, for which par i s 8:30. (It
l a slightly u p h i l l . The author usually
takes a t a x i ) . From Wimbledon station
there runs a D i s t r i c t Line train to Earla
Court only at 12:41 a.a., or, f a i l i n g
that, a Southern Region train at 12:51
that reaches Waterloo at 1:05. This leaves
4 minutes i n which to nip smartly over
HUngerford Bridge to oatch a no. 9 'bus
(which departs from Ludgate Circus at
1:03). Tads i s a very handy l i t t l e 'bus,
although i t doesn't run on Sunday nights.
Instead there i s an extra one at about
1:30 on Saturday, ao then you can take
your time crossing tee bridge.
Allowing one minute for tickets at
Wimbledon, you therefore need to get
your south-bound train at Tooting Broad-
way at or before 12:39, but on no ac-
count catch a later one (since Wimbledon
l a even worse than Tooting to walk back
from). This procedure thus saves you at
from). This procedure thus gains yon a
good 20 minutes.
On Sunday, the last tralns*lesve
about aa hour earlier tean on week-days,
whioh role* them out for our purpose.
However, there Is aa all-night 'bus,
route no. 287, which runs every nigh)
of the week EXCEPT SATURDAYS, that amy
be of assistance. These •buses stop at
Tooting Broadway at 12:58 and 1:03 a.m.
They both go to Charing Cross Under-
ground station, but in opposite d i r -
ections, so watch i t l They arrive at
Charing Croat at 1:32 and liSS re ays it,
lvely, so there i s plenty of time l a
which to walk up to the Strand aat e*t
the 297 'bus at 1:53 to South Eeasiagtoa.
