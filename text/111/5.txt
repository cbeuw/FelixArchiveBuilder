GYMNASIUM
Dear S i r ,
I am afraid you have made a great
mistake i n publishing the article about the
Gymnasium i n the last issue. You do not
know a l l the facts and some of those
you state are incorrect,
Superficially, i t does appear that thei
has been a l o t of time spent i n preparing
the Gymnasium. But that i s not the whole
story.
In the beginning there was to be no
Cymnasium.This f a c i l i t y was to be and
w i l l be included i n Princes Gardens,
together with squash courts, a swimming
pool and other amenities. These should
appear by 1960.
The Gymnasium, as i t now stands, was
intended to be a small hs.ll, an overflow
from the Concert H a l l , which you must
admit, i s needed on large functions.
Why i t was considered that a small dance
floor was more important than a Gymnasium
was due possibly to a member having a s t r -
onger say i n the House Committee at that
time.
Fortunately, with great persuasion by
same students, I t was permitted to convert
the small dance floor into a Gymnasium,
after i t had been completed.
So there was the task, of turning an
excellent and well-designed dance floor
into a robust gymnasium. A l l the f i t t i n g s
for the apparatus had to be remade so
that they could be used In this gymnasium;
this takes time. Hew equipment had to be
C L O T H E S AND
Dear S i r and Mr.'Christian Dior'-vid
Stevens,
I must admit that the wearing of
Jeans, check s h i r t , baggy pullover and
fluorescent sooks does not make an engin-
eer, but on the other hand I defy anyone
to prove that whiteâ€”eollar and t i e out-
f i t s make engineers. Surely I t could be
within the realms of p o s s i b i l i t y that i n
this rather unreal student world of ours,
some people by dressing i n a more casual
fashion, might find i t easier to l i v e and
work. % personal experience i s that the
wearing of such olothes breeds i n me a
state of mind that accepts the*very serious'
t r i v i a l i t i e s of student organisations, and
makes me wast to help i n the work Involved
in these.
Of course, jk. cannot claim that others
would find the same, but I think that our
President was mistaken to express such a
private opinion at the Freshers' Dinners.
On these oooasions he is unassailable as
far as argument i s concerned, and he also
possesses a far greater sway over new
students, nervously groping their way
through the f i r s t few weeks at College .
Hoping, then, that inthe future Dave w i l l
confine his 'criticisms' to the well-worn
but increasingly acute problem of the 10-5
brown-bagger, I remain

bought, from balls up to the complete f i t t -
ings of ropes and beams. This task of
conversion i s not only dealt with by
members of I.C. but also the organisers
of the U.L.U. Gymnasium. I t i s not an
easy problem.
Besides taking time i t also takes
money, and money does not flow rapidly when
there i s a large programme i n Princes
Gardens. When i t was decided to turn the
dance floor into a gymnasium, most of the
money allocated for that part of the
Union had been used. To convert and
completely equip the h a l l was not favour-
able from the financial point of view.If
i t had not been for the generosity of the
College, the tolerance of the Planning
Office and the forethought of some students
about a year ago you would not have had a
gymnasium at a l l , yet.
Yours etc.,
I.J.Flint

Editor's note:
Mr. F l i n t has not corrected a single
one of the facts stated i n our artiole.
He makes no mention of our main point,
the unfortunate i n s t a l l a t i o n and subse-
quent boxing-in of the radiators.
The fact that i t was only recently
decided to have a gymnasium (although
the plans published i n 1954 showed i t )
has not previously been made public. I f
i t be necessary to make 'mistakes' i n
order to uncover the facts of the matter,
FELIX w i l l be making many more.
CRITICISM
Dear Editor,
I address my letter thus because I
do not wish ?T. Lenaaen to consider my
remarks at the Fresher's Dinner to be
directed towards him i n particular.
I must admit that in !y. Lenssen's
letter I have read for the f i r s t time
that oarelessnes and casualness go hand
in hand with efficiency - the opposite
is always the case.
As for his criticism that I should
not use my position as President to
influence the easily impressionable
freshers, I should like to point out
that there ia l i t t l e point in taking
up such a position i f one does not i n -
tend to exert any influence, so long
as one i s sure that one's influences
are directed towards the right end.
Also I had hoped that everyone had
noticed that I gave f i r s t place to
advising the freshers on the more
obvious subject of the 1 0 - 5 brown-
baggers.
And now to turn the tone from defence
to attack: this i s the f i r s t criticism
I have received on this subject and to
Judge from the reception my remarks
received at the dinners I feel that the
vast majority of the College agree with
me. Freshers, plesse draw your own con-
clusions!
Yours, i n bed with ' f l u ,
F.David Stevens.
E.C. REPLIES
Dear S i r ,
On behalf of the Entertainments
Committee I feel I must take this opp-
ortunity to reply to the criticisms
levelled at the Committee i n a letter
to your paper last issue.
F i r B t l y I must point out that the
Editor failed to notify the Entertain-
ments Committee of such criticisms thus
preventing us replying i n the same" issue.
Although the Entertainments Committee
was, at the time, and s t i l l i s reduced to
three members instead of six this Comm-
ittee was set the task of running no few-
er than four functions i n a fortnight.
Not only was this done to the satisfaction
of the majority of danoers, but the amenities
available were also improved.
With regard to the authors* remarks about
an East-End working -mens club, I feel this
can be attributed rather to the behaviour
and drese of certain students than to the
manner i n whioh the dances are organised.
Surely i t i s not too much to ask that a
man wears a t i e , a jacket and a pair of
trousers with some form of vertical crease
i n them.
I agree that i t Is far better that a
student acts as Master of Ceremonies
rather than the band leader, but i f one
member of the Committee had not to spend
that complete evening asking "Non-paying
guests " to leave i t would have been pos-
sible.
The Committee regret that not a l l students
who wish to attend Saturday-night dances can
be accommodated, but have done their utmost
to increase the number of dancers by opening
the Upper Eefectory.
I therefore feel that In the light of these
facts the authors should reconsider their
statements and promptly offer their apologies
to the few people who have worked so hard to
make these dances possible.
Yours f a i t h f u l l y
Gil Streets.
Editor's note:
We apologise to the Entertainments
Committee for not giving them the oppor-
tunity to reply i n the last issue. I t i s
not our polloy to serialise correspond-
ence of this nature.
Dear S i r ,
We appreciate the d i f f i c u l t conditions
under which the depleted Committee has been
working, and we were glad to notice a mar-
ked improvement in the organisation of the
last two E.C , hons.
We suggest that the tickets axe collected
at the door to prevent the entry of 'non-
paying guests' as the present system is not
foolproof.
Yours f a i t h f u l l y ,
f.S.Smith
F.Porgess.
Editor's note:
The past experience of the Enter*
tainmenta Committee leads them to
believe that the system in use at the.
moment i s the most practicable.
