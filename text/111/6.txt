VIEWPOINT POVERING IN
•Manners maket.h man', thus says the
enigmatic statement whose author i s l o s t
i n the depths of time. Good manners are
an essential part of the Gods of Conduct
that a l l well-educated persons should
follow. The purpose of an University i s
to educate i t s members. This does not
mean just 'getting a degree'. An
University should not spoon-feed i t s
members, they should be taught to think
for themselves, and t o follow the exam-
ples set by their superiors.
Let us stop and think f o r a moment;
are we doing ourselves, and our Alma
Mater justice; can we hold the job
which has been offered on the strength
of our degree? Can we represent our
firm at conferences and dinners without
appearing uneducated and ill-mannered?
Manners and education go hand i n hand,
one without the other i s a rare event;
not everyone i s fortunate i n having been
to a Public School where i n general good
manners are a sine qua non, but some
Grammar Schools also have t h i s f a c i l i t y
for imparting manners and bearing. Even
i f you have not had these advantages a t
school, your presence at an University
should enable you t o right these wrongs
as soon as possible. I t i s the duty o f
a l l o l d lags to set a good example t o
freshmen. Do you?
In the f i r s t few weeks of this term
we have had many examples of bad behav-
iour by persons who should have known
better. At the second hop of term, a
post-graduate student (now i n his f i f t h
year at I.C.) offered to hold open the
door t o the upper refectory so that a
lady member of the Entertainments Com-
mittee could carry a large and heavy tray
of cups of coffee through. As she was
passing through, t h i s lout let. go the
door; the coffee, cups, tray and a n were
s p i l t on the floor. What apologies d i d
this young lady get? Not a word. This
long-haired individual had disappeared.
I suppose at the time he thought t h i s
was amusing. We don't.
Often when i n the Union, you see
another member following behind you;
being polite you hold the door open f o r
him, with what result? More often than
not-you get no thanks, not even a cursory
'nod, and the said creature stalks straight
past you, and, i f i t i s the refectory
door you have held open, the odds are
that you w i l l have t o j o i n the queue
behind him as he i s so bad-mannered as
to make h i s way i n front of you. Would
you do t h i s at home i n front of your
guests and friends? I doubt i t , f o r i f
you d i d they would not remain your
friends f o r long.
What i s the proper dress f o r a large
dinner? Lounge suits of course, unless i t
i s formal and dinner suits are called f o r .
At recent freshers' dinners, i t has been
noticeable that quite a few people went
i n sports jackets and blazers. I suppose
that i f these people were invited out t o
lunoh by the Managing Director of the
firm unfortunate enough t o employ them,
they would go dressed i n t h e i r same
everyday a t t i r e .
Everyone i s entitled to drink i f he
wants t o , but there i s absolutely no
reason whatsoever why he should make
himself unpleasant and objectionable t o
his fellow men. Nothing i s mare repulsive
than a drunken man; why i s i t necessary
to drink to excess? No reason at a l l , i t
i s purely a sign of lack of common-sense,
i t does no one any good; and often causes
someone harm or damage. And why must bar
glasses be smashed f o r no reason at a l l ;
accidents can happen, but i n many cases
i t i s sheer bad behaviour and an i n f a n t i l e
complex which makes these children delight
in •the sound of breaking glass. In the
long run a l l such damage has to be made
good, and the price f a l l s on everyone and
not just on the bad-mannered hooligans
who caused the damage.
Make f u l l use of the Union and i t s
f a c i l i t i e s , and further your education t o
the f u l l e s t of your a b i l i t y , and don't
leave here as a moronic uneducated ignor-
amus so that everyone can say 'Oh he's
just another of those poor technological
graduates who only thinks by his slide
rule'.
C01E ON I.C. YOU'HE BEING GOT AT.
Nelson.
SWITZERLAND
V i c t o r i a Station was assured of a
place i n history when, on June 23rd.
1957, I.C. Hover Crew assembled there
en route for summer camp at Kandereteg
i n the Bernese Oberlsnd. The party was
sixteen strong and was well provided
with an assortment of tents, ice-axes,
ropes, crampons and sundry other items,
not to mention well f i l l e d rucsaos,
most of whioh proved singularly awkward
to manage on the t r a i n journey across Eur-
ope, and singulary useless i n Switzerland •
However, Kandersteg was reached with the
party s t i l l whole, the only mishap
being the leaving behind of two members
of the crew i n the middle of France, due
to an unfortunate misunderstanding
on the length of timethat the t r a i n
stopped i n the station. Fortunately
they caught up again with the main party
i n Basel.
Arriving at Kandersteg station, the.
Hovers soon had an opportunity of testing
their hiking muscles on the two-mile walk
to the International Boy Scouts1
Chalet
lying at the head of the steep-sided Kander
valley where they were to camp. The
chalet was reached without loss of l i f e
however, and almost immediately the prev-
iously fine weather changed to a torrentia
downpour. This persuaded the crew that
i t was better•to sleep i n dry bunks
inside the chalet than i n wet tents out-
side, especially as the river flowing
past the camp-site was dangerously near to
overflowing. As things turned out, except
for an occasional thunderstorm of short
duration, the weather for the whole of
the sixteen day stay was absolutely clear,
the sun being at times almost too hot
for hiking.
After two days walking i n the mountain!
around the chalet i t was unanimously decide
that no attempt would be made to r i v a l
the I.C. Norwegian and Kar&koram exped-
itions i n their mountaineering exploits,
the normal alpine paths providing quite
strenuous enough exercise. However the
Rover crew can now claim that some of
i t s members have climbed the Hockenhorn
(10,000 ft.) by the efforts of their bodle*
and the Jungfraujoch (11,000 ft.) by
train.

We notice that the magazines have dis-

They have reappeared i n the writing-

The reason given f o r ths change i s that
