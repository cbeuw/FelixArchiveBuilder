Founding Conference
of the Workers
Revolutionary Party
Present at the O d e o n ,
H a m m e r s m i t h , last Sun-
day w e r e 3 , 0 0 0 trade
unionists, youth', house-
w i v e s a n d students for
the F o u n d i n g Conference
of the Revolutionary
Party in Britain.
There delegates a n d
m e m b e r s f r o m a l l over
Britain pledged them-
selves to fight u n c o m -
promisingly to build the
Revolutionary Party a n d
take the w o r k i n g class to
power.
One of the first steps
that the W o r k e r s Revo-
lutionary Party, as it w a s
n a m e d , took w a s to affi-
liate to that International
Committee of t h e Fourth
International as the Bri-
tish section thereof.
In his political report
National Secretary Gerry
Healy stressed " n e v e r
ueiore in nistory nave
w e h a d a period s u c h as
today w h e n the working
class internationally is
c o m i n g forward to de-
t e n d its rights a n d liv-
ing standards a n d enter-
ing into conflict w i t h its
Governments . . . • d u e
to the rapidly deepening
economip c r i s i s " .
He pointed out that in
such a situation the
question of leadership is
paramount a n d that
b u i l d i n g of a revolution-
ary leadership to fight to
;
take the w o r k i n g class to
power is the most urgent
task facing everyone in
Britain today.
A d i s c u s s i o n on the
report took place w i t h
many delegates empha-
sising the need to re-
m o v e the Tory govern-
ment w h i c h w a s attack-
ing their living standards
urged o n by the worsen-
ing e c o n o m i c crisis, a n d
the betrayals of the pre-
sent T U a n d Labour lead-
ership in every situation
confronting the w o r k i n g
class today.
In the evening a play
" M o s c o w T r i a l s " w a s
performed by Socialist
Labour League actors,
musicians a n d sympa-
thisers to set the record
straight for events after
the successful Russian
Revolution of 1 9 1 7 .
The trials w h i c h were
the most gigantic frame
up in a l l history execut-
ed most of the Bolshevik
leaders as agents of a
"Trotskyite - Zinovievite
Terrorist C o n s p i r a c y " .
Organised by Stalin
they enabled h i m to des-
troy a l l opposition to the
formation of the Stalinist
bureaucracy w h i c h
usurped the political
power of the working
class a n d established
themselves as a ruling
caste in Russian society.
The betrayals of the
w o r l d w i d e C o m m u n i s t
Parties w h i c h necessar-
ily occurred from the
politics of its K r e m l i n
based leadership were
also stressed.
A party building fund
of £100,000 w a s a n -
nounced as complete
after an excellent collec-
tion at the conference.
A s well as the daily
" W o r k e r s P r e s s " the
weekly youth newspaper
" K e e p Left" two n e w
monthly papers have
been added to reach out
into specific sections of
the working class to
fight for the building of
a revolutionary leader-
ship: " T h e Entertainer"
and " M i n e r s N e w s " for
the entertainments i n -
dustry a n d the miners.
The establishment of
this Revolutionary Party
is a complete v i n d i c a -
tion of the correctness
of Trotskyism a n d is only
the first of many —
they will be built in a l l
countries in the w o r l d to
fight for the internation-
al dictatorship of the
proletariat.
A s Trotsky s a i d : "I
a m sure of the victory
of the Fourth Internation-
al — go f o r w a r d ! "
Students a n d workers
everywhere in a l l profes-
sions are urged to take
up the challenge to fight
to build this revolution-
ary leadership a n d join
the Workers Revolution-
ary Party.
OVEMBER 14th 1973
j A day w h i c h w i l l

of t h a t s m a l l minority o f
relics f r o m feudalism —
the monarchists.
It is o f course the d a y
that Princess A n n e w i l l
pledge her troth to Cap-
tain Mark Phil-lips. A s
has already been pub-
licised widely i n the gut-

no qualms at repeating
it; Princess A n n e w i l l

he is o n l y a Captain in

she is a C o l o n e l in hers.
What a precedent for in-
s u b o r d i n a t i o n !
B a c k t o reality, how-
ever . . . November 14
is also t h e day of the
little p u b l i c i s e d , still l e s s
understood, still less
liked N U S work-in. N U S
have d e c i d e d n o t t o
change t h e date a n d the
W i n d s o r s certainly.won't
so there will be a clash
but as John Randall ex-
plains:
"If it makes any dif-
ference at a l l , we are
pleased rather than dis-
pleased that the m u c h -
publicised Phillips
W i n d s o r w e d d i n g is tak-
ing place on the same
day as students are de-
monstrating a b o u t
grants. It enables us dra-
matically to draw atten-
tion to certain injustices
in our society w h i c h it
w o u l d be appropriate to
bring to the notice of as
many people as possible
on November 1 4 t h " .
He w a s referring to
the discrepancy between
the financial situation of
a female student before
and after marriage a n d
that of an average Bri-
tish Princess.

Once upon a time
m a n h a d no other means
of transportation than his
o w n feet. He h a d to
choose the easiest w a y
through his environment
w h e n he wanted to move
around. O c c a s i o n a l l y he
w o u l d have to remove
stones, plants or trees to
facilitate his transporta-
tion or that of his goods.
This w a s decided by
h i m alone (or in small
social groups) so that
the s a m e people that
w o u l d work w o u l d bene-
fit of the results.
Nowadays road build-
ers, car makers, etc. (i.e.
scientists a n d engin-
eers) are not controlled
by human d e c i s i o n , in
fact, they are not con-
trolled at a l l , but they
are encouraged to grow
indefinitely by the arti-
ficial profit system. What
m a k e s things even
worse is that travellers
or commuters are also
encouraged to move
more a n d faster by the
artificial profit system,
either directly (travel
agents, British Rail a d -
verts, etc.) or indirectly
(faster moving means
more b u s i n e s s ) . In other
words the situation is
completely out of con-
trol a n d there is no re-
cognised w a y of telling
whether w e have very
little, enough or too
m u c h or too fast move-
ment; worse than that,
by definition, we have
too little, a n d this is sup-
posed to apply forever!
and even worse, w e
don't object to it! But
how are w e at l . C . i n -
volved in this systematic
blind pursuit?
Let's look at one of
the products of the kind
of science a n d techno-
logy w e are normally
pursuing at l . C .
If " C o n c o r d e " ever
comes into service, it
w i l l bring to a f e w a fas-
ter rhythm of life, a n d
because of the nature of
our present social sys-
tem, it w i l l bring them
privilege. T h i s a l s o
means a disadvantage
for those w h o don't use
it, w h o w i l l eventually
c o m e to d e m a n d its use,
k n o w i n g that this w a y of
reducing the privilege
gap is more feasible
than the other alterna-
tive, i.e. trying to stop
Concorde o n c e it's
brought into use. In
other words, social a d -
diction to the n e w crea-
ture. This means that the
" a d v a n t a g e s " (if there
are any) of this plane
w o u l d really c o m e to the
people w h e n its use w a s
w i d e l y spread ( w h i c h
w o u l d be a long w a y
ahead) time by w h i c h
another similar invention
w o u l d appear, d i s c r i m -
inating the majority a n d
repeating the cycle. That
is, in the meantime (i.e.
always) the majority of
people w o u l d suffer from
discrimination a n d a n
unsatisfied need. This
happens because the
plane is designed to cre-
ate a necessity for a l l ,
and its creation w a s
motivated by profits a n d
by the same uncontrol-
led - growth - maniac -
m a d - r a c e - d e a d -
circle.
This plane is no revo-
lutionary thing, but the
logical by-product of
continuing o u r o l d
trends of building what-
ever c a n be built as long
as w e c a n create a de-
mand for it, a n d in the
absence of a humane
system controlling both
the " s u p p l y a n d d e m a n d
of transportation" w h i c h
by the way is n o w re-
garded as purely econ-
omic c o m m o d i t y (fam-
iliar?).
This fits very w e l l
into the definition of the
Green-Red " R e v o l u t i o n "
that I gave in the last
issue of " F e l i x " , namely
the systematic substitu-
tion of m a n ' s abilities,
senses a n d m e c h a n i s m s
by institutions, organis-
ations, machines or ap-
paratus, that lead to the
gradual atrophy of the
formers a n d a d d i c t i o n to
or dependence o n the
latters, w i t h the conse-
quent control or manip-
ulation of human masses
and finally leading to
s o m e kind of enslave-
ment.
The worst part of the
story is that w e at l . C .
(supposed to be going
to b u i l d the w o r l d of to-
morrow, etc. . . . ) are
c o m p e l l e d to co-operate.
This is done by pre-
packaged curricula, pre-
d e f i n e d professions,
monopoly of degrees
a n d qualifications,
monopoly of information
and learning tools in uni-
versities a n d colleges,
monopoly of privileges
for those w h o consume
m o r e institutionalized
" e d u c a t i o n " , fragment-
ing a n d specialising (i.e.
lengthening) fields of
study, thus restricting
our v i e w of the w o r l d ,
labelling taboo the mix-
ing of science or tech-
nology with politics, eco-
logy, sociology, etc., etc.
But even w o r s e is that
nobody c a n be held res-
ponsible for a l l this,
moreover I can't imag-
ine anybody (or a group)
so clever a n d destruc-
tive to have implemented
such a system, a n d yet
pass unnoticed. Thus, it
seems, that the only
" g u i l t y " persons that w e
can find are ourselves
for not stopping s u c h
situation; but are w e too
impotent already? . . . .

DISAFFILIATION MOVES
by BATH UNIVERSITY
STUDENTS UNION
In a non-policy making
debate at Bath Univer-
sity last week a motion
to disaffiliate from N U S
was proposed by Presi-
dent J o h n Kiddey.
K i d d e y said that N U S
conferences were too
pre-occupied with Chile
and Northern Ireland,
" i s s u e s not relevant to
s t u d e n t s " . H e said that
not enough d i s c u s s i o n
was spent on education
and student welfare.
N U S President J o h n
Randall spoke against
the motion saying that
the correct thing for Bath
to d o w a s to stay within
N U S a n d fight to get
motions of interest to it
prioritised at N U S con-
ferences.
He failed to point out
the necessity for discus-
sion on issues other than
education a n d student
welfare for the political
lessons that c a n be
learnt from these events.
H e also failed to men-
tion that, isolated from
the strength of the N U S
students and their unions
w o u l d be open to t h e
most enormous dangers.
Disaffiliation w o u l d efr
fectively sabotage the
student union at Bath or
anywhere else.
