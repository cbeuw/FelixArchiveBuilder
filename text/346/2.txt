NUS to fold ?
The net result of the
Stalinist dominated N U S
exec's wheelings a n d
dealings 'is n o w courting
out: Bath University and
Newcastle P o l y t e c h n i c
have already d i s c u s s e d
motions t o disaffiliate
from N U S a n d murmwr-
ings about disaffiliation
are growing louder 'in
many colleges through-
out the country.
So far none of these
have been passed, a l -
though they have neces-
sitated the despatch of,
N U S president J o h n
Randall to colleges
where the murmurings
have grown into a n o m -
inous rumble from the
right w i n g to d o BO.
Randall turned up at
King's on Thursday
where the first stages of
disaffiliation moves are
occurring to try a n d
quash them. H e d i d n o t
appear unduly worried
by the sudden emerg-
ence of these right w i n g
tactics as those motions
w h i c h h a d been tabled
had been k i c k e d out.
What does the N U S
exec think about t h i s ?
The story begins back in
the last stages of Digby
J a c k ' s reign a t the N U S
National Conference i n
Exeter, Easter this year
. . . . A m o t i o n w a s
tabled b y N U S exec t o
split off N U S services
(travel, insurance, etc.)
from N U S so that they
were financially 'inde-
pendent. The reasons for
doing so were 'stated a s
" t h e existing provision
of N U S services a n d t h e
arrangements f o r their
control are inadequate".
H o w e v e r it s e e m e d
strange a t t h e time that
the exec h a d allocated
one of its t w o priorities
for t h e conference order
paper to that apparently
u n c o n t e n t i o u s motion.
It is clear to all now
that in view of recent
events the N U S exec
was preparing even at
that stage to conscious-
ly liquidate NUS.
A l t h o u g h it w a s arg-
ued by the exec that to
split t h e services off
from N U S w o u l d have
saved N U S from a n y
financial 'maladies that
the services might have
collected, in fact quite
the reverse w a s true: t h e
splitting ensured that
whatever happens to
N U S as a political body,
lucrative profitable N U S
Services c a n continue
making their money off
students.
T h e demonstration
that occurred o n W e d -
nesday w a s spontan-
eously organised by t h e
: London Students Organ-
isation ( L S O ) , t h e Lon-
don area organisation Of
N U S .
Earlier this year the
exec h a d thrown out a
motion 'calling for a
national march, opting
for local demonstration's
and expressions o f sup-
port for t h e grants c a m -
paign to b e organised on
an uncentralised local
basis.
T o c a p it all the N U S
even presented to the
emergency conference,
held at Imperial last
term, a motion calling
for a " w o r k - i n " to b e
held this term.
W h e n questioned on
the nature o f the " w o r k -
i n " they replied that it
was up to each indivi-
dual college t o organise
a " d o - y o u r - o w n - t h i n g "
alternative syllabus t o
everyday college life.
Despite this vacuity
of leadership, students
are prepared to fight,
even though the d e m o on
W e d n e s d a y w a s not o r -
ganised nationally by the
N U S , over 1 0 , 0 0 0 stud-
ents ( L 6 C estimated
15,000) turned up, near-
9
ly a l l from London, to
voice their anger at the
rapidly vanishing value
of the grant.
T h e N U S a r e trying
the disgusting sell-out
tactics of engineers'
leader Hugh S c a n I on
Who, despite a pile of
telegrams a mile high o n
His plush d e s k d e m a n d -
ing a national strike of
the A U E ' W until the
£75,000 fine is With-
drawn, offers no leader-
ship a n d left it up to
each individual area or-
ganisation t o arrange
strikes / stoppages / go
slows/overtime bans or
whatever they like.
T h i s c o m e s a s no sur-
prise of course a s the
C o m m u n i s t 'Party w h o
control N U S exec have
been continually exalting
Soanlon (an e x - C P m e m -
ber) i n t h e c o l u m n s o f
their paper and covering
up f o r each betrayal he
has 'done.
Never before has the
question of leadership
been of s u c h paramount
importance i n t h e Trade
Unions a n d t h e N U S .
There is not a squeak of
objection t o t h e plum-
meting value of o u r
grants visible In the
actions o f the N U S exec.
They a r e preparing quite
c o n s c i o u s l y to hold back
any struggle of students
that turns into a political
fight against the Tory
government. This situa-
tion of politically bank-
rupt leadership is a
stamping ground for the
right Wing w h o w i l l use
it to disaffiliate from the
N U S .
A s N U S collapses
round the ears o f the
Stalinist N U S exec they
Will place t h e blame on
the students just a s i n
Chile the rise t o p o w e r
of the Junta w a s the
fault of the working and
middle classes there.
A r e w e t o let them get
away with this f o r one
moment longer? Only
the policy o f immediate
c a s h supplementary
grants tied 'to the student
cost of living index c a n
maintain our depreciat-
ing standard o f living
and yet they refuse to
put forward such a dem-
and to t h e Triennial
Review o r t o rally sup-
port for i t among the
students.
The Y S S S w i l l cairi-
paign most ruthlessly to
expose and replace these
treacherous leaders a n d
appeals t o a l l students
Who are n o longer pre-
pared to sit back a n d
watch the N U S des-
troyed by these enemies
of the student movement
to join them in a fight to
defend o u r grants a n d
our democratic rights.
Parking Stickers
I am still in p o s s e s s i o n
of over 2 0 parking per-
mits. It seems rather
strange that, consider-
ing the lack of official
parking space, there are
still people wanting to
c o m e to college by c a r
and yet not use t h e c o l -
lege parking that they've
been allocated. F o r the
sake of others w h o w e r e
unsuccessful in their ap-
plications, I think it
only fair that, if these
stickers are not collect-
ed, they Will b e re-
allocated.
Electricity Supply
Y o u m a y be aware
from the national press
and radio that interrup-
tions t o supply may take
place d u e to t h e power
engineers' w a g e s dis-
pute. T h e London Elec-
tricity Board has i n -
formed the college that,
although power cuts a r e
not expected, voltage re-
duction m a y b e Intro-
d u c e d at any time.
The normal operating
variation of ± 5 % o n the
normal voltage of 4 1 5
volts w o u l d , under s u c h
circumstances, not be
maintained. Reductions
of up to — 1 0 % ( 4 1 . 5
volts) c a n b e expected
without warning. Conser-
vation of electricity dur-
ing any voltage reduc-
tions will be essential.
The L E B have also
warned us that if the sit-
uation deteriorates a
system of planned dis-
connections w i l l b e i n -
troduced.
If you have ever found
yourself in the m i d d l e of
one of o u r large labora-
tories late at night a n d a
power failure occurs you
may well find yourself i n
a very t i c k l i s h situation.
This happened to
s o m e unfortunate people
w h o found themselves 'in
their department, in dif-
ferent parts o f the b u i l d -
ing, at about 8 . 3 0 p . m .
one night When the
power cable running
alongside the building
site failed. Without
torch or matches they
groped their w a y past ex-
perimental rigs a n d other
sources o f danger a n d
eventually found them-
selves i n a pitch dark
corridor. Trying t o re-
member where the stair-
case w a s (there being
nothing to give them the
faintest clue) provided
quite a task a n d it w a s
10 minutes o r so until
they found it and eventu-
ally got out.
It is, o f course, a l -
ways better if there
are t w o of y o u and t h e
security guards know
exactly where y o u a r e .
Even if y o u have not
taken the precaution of
having your o w n torch
available, security w i l l
eventually c o m e round
to get people out. Y o u
w o u l d think, of course
that the battery operat-
ing emergency lighting
w o u l d 'be provided, b u t
no s u c h luck, merciless
treasury has seen t o that
and the provision of s u c h
matters n o w is a very
costly business. N o , the
solution i s simple, never
work alone after normal
hours. A l w a y s make
sure that you sign in and
out at the security post
and i f possible carry a
torch or have one at a
known place i n your
desk or 'hanging up b e -
hind the door or where-
ever it i s most conven
ient.
Of course, i f y o u
happen to b e in the lift at
the time, b a d luck. T h e
college maintenance en
gineers have a routine
emergency drill w h i c h
requires them t o check
every lift eventually.
