FROM GAYSOC
Dearest Darling Editor,
What a gorgeous bul-
letin you have — and
it's only been out twice!
— love it to death I
W e l l then, I've had
the loveliest thought,
and rather than fret keep-
ing secrets I said to my-
self, " J u i c y , darling, you
s i m p l y must write and
tell s o m e o n e " . W e l l ,
dears, it all started the
other daysie-waysie, just
like this:
After innocently m i n -
c i n g round the lab (look-
ing a few of the boys up
. . . and d o w n ) I slid
A REPLY TO
"JUICY"
Dear Editor,
M y first reaction upon
reading the above letter
was to d i s m i s s it as the
rather c h i l d i s h pile of
drivel it evidently is. It
is hard to see exactly
Whats its purpose is. It
can hardly be designed
to bolster the author's
ego since he s o m e h o w
neglected to sign his real
name at the bottom, and
v i e w e d as humour it is
over w o r k e d , pretentious
and downright tired.
W h i c h ever way you look
at it, it doesn't say m u c h
for the mentality lurking
around somewhere at its
point of origin.
However, on reflec-
tion I realised that it
effectively illustrates a
rather distressing trend
in society as a whole.
T h i s is the widespread
attitude that the homo-
sexual is automatically
funny. N o w I'm sure we
all know., and love (if
you'll pardon the expres-
sion) Kenneth W i l l i a m s
a n d his particular brand
of humour, (I'll do m y
best to ignore D i c k
Emery and his particular
brand of humour), but
he does perpetuate the
idea of the c a m p "ster-
e o t y p e " that exists only
as a small minority of
the gay scene, and he is,
into a . . . . stool, slowly
(at first) to rest my poor
footsies, when I thought,
" O o o h ! If only I c o u l d
get it out in the o p e n ! "
So I ripped off my figure-
hugging White jacket (it
really brings out m y pos-
ture!) and simply flew
back to my room for a
cold shower! After dry-
ing myself, slowly, (at
first), I wrote d o w n this
teeny-weeny note, seal-
ed it with a big kiss a n d
sent it to that ever so
B U T C H - l o o k i n g Editor of
Felix.
Here it is again, dears:
"If any of you boys
when all is said a n d
done, harmful, in that it's
difficult to see what pro-
gress Gay Rights can
make whilst this attitude
persists (note to M r .
Withers: It was this that
I was, at the Chemistry
Freshers' Dinner, rather
ineptly trying to d i s c u s s
with Dr. Phillips when he
was w h i s k e d off before I
c o u l d make my point
properly. A l s o I found it
necessary to relieve m y
bladder O N C E before
the loyal toast, but I do
apologise for any fail-
ings there may be in m y
sense of humour, and
sense of good manners).
W e l l , enough of this
frivolity. I'd like to take
this opportunity to cover
a serious matter. To the
character w h o ' s been
wandering round the
College taking d o w n our
(Gaysoc) notices:
I'm sure that you de-
rive a real sense of pride-
and well-being from the
knowledge that you're
really doing your bit to-
wards ruining three m i l -
lion of your compatriots"
lives, but I'm afraid that
I cannot share your point
of view, and feel c o m -
pelled to do all in m y
power to frustrate your
efforts. It may cost me a
mint in time and dyeline
paper, but every notice
will be replaced as many
times as it proves nec-
w o u l d like to join a
special club, just pop
round to my place, after
six and we'll fix you up.
There will be all the old
favourites like " S w a p -
ping telephone n u m b e r s "
and we've even arranged
tights parties! . . . Isn't
it jus? wickedl W e ' l l all
have a super time, and
don't fret, I used to be
nervous too (at first) ".
W e l l , that's all for
n o w dears. Don't forget,
do try and make it. (All
the others w i l l ) .
Love and kisses,
J u i c y xxx
essary, and I'd hazard a
guess that I've far more
patience and persever-
ance than you can mus-
ter. If you do feel c o m -
pelled to make a stand
against our " m o r a l dec-
a d e n c e " (excuse me a
moment while I just rinse
the nasty taste out of m y
mouth), then I'd ask you
to submit an article to
" F e l i x " stating the case
for Bigotry, but do
please sign it. I've no
w i s h to soil my hands
replying to anonymous
letters. Otherwise keep
your filthy fingers off
other people's property
a n d your interfering
nose out of o t h e r
people's private affairs.
(Incidentally, you m i s s e d
the one in the Haldane
Library). I do seem to
have departed from the
tone that a letter to the
Editor s h o u l d take, but
I'm certainly not going
to stop writing it n o w !
One last point (if you
haven't already heard) :
A n y o n e (male or female,
straight or gay) Who's
interested in joining the
I.C. Gaysoc s h o u l d get
in touch with me as soon
as possible.
Love and peace,

A s a portrayal of re-

seen n o w by the ordin-

valuable p i e c e of d o c u -

little in the way of a

M I C E PIE
The College is facing
a minor invasion of mice,
beetles and other pests.
T o deal w i t h t h e m effect-
ively a contract has been
placed with a firm of
pest control experts and
over the past few weeks
you may have seen evi-
dence of their work.
Although these pests
can be eliminated they
will always return if
food is available for
them. To assist the Col-
lege it is essential that
no food is left exposed
— it should always be
kept in a metal or plas-
tic sealed container.
Papers w h i c h once con-
tained food s h o u l d be
disposed of in lidded
dustbins and not in
waste paper baskets
(dustbins can be found
in your nearest kitchen).
It is only by individual
co-operation that pests
can be controlled. If you
see any pests, please re-
port them by ringing
INT. 3 9 5 4 — but make
absolutely sure that you
are not actually feeding
them !
