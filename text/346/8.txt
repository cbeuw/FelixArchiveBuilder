Dear Friend,
W e are writing to e n -
list your help and that of
your fellow-students in
work w h i c h w e think you
w i l l agree i s of great im-
portance.
The Lutuii M e m o r i a l
Foundation is endeav-
ouring t o put right in
S o u t h Africa itself the
evil effects of Bantu edu-
cation, w h i c h has n o w
been in operation for a
generation. W e are aim-
i n g to send school books
»nd scientific equipment
to schools in a l l four
Provinces, a n d if w e
c o u l d w e w o u l d like to
purchase mobile libraries
for them, t o reach the
more remote schools.
However, w e believe that
colleges and universities
in Britain c o u l d help in
the first instance w i t h
our drive t o collect
books. I enclose a list of
those books w h i c h are
useful to Black South
Af r i can sch oolch i I d ren.
The L M F can arrange for
their transportation to
South Africa a n d could
collect books sent to a
station in London; the
I M F w i l l also pay for
transportation c o s t s
within this country.
The facts about books
in schools i n South A f r i -
ca are as follows: in
1 9 6 8 — R 14.48 per A f r i -
can pupil w a s allocated.
R 2 2 8 . 0 0 per white pupil;
sometimes 4 A f r i c a n
pupils share 1 textbook;
i n many schools there is
no library at a l l ; as a re-
sult, 1 in 2 4 0 A f r i c a n
pupils reaches matricu-
lation; 1 i n 1 2 , 0 0 0 re-
ceives a university deg-
ree.
I think you w i l l there-
fore feel that this work
is of major importance,
to arrest or m i n i m i s e the
evil effects of the system
of apartheid i n South
A f r i c a . W e w o u l d very
much like to hear from
you if y o u a r e able to
take part i n the scheme.
Yours sincerely,
P I C T O N V . M B A T H A ,
A c t i n g Director.

EDITORIAL
Dear Kathleen,
I apologise for not
having replied to con-
fused a n d slanderous
letter i n last w e e k ' s
Felix a n d shall remedy
the situation here.
Revolutionary politics
are necessarily in con-
flict w i t h those of the
working class w h i c h only
arises spontaneously to
the level of trade union
(i.e. reformist) con-
sciousness.
In order to break the
working c l a s s from re-
f o r m i s m it is" necessary
for it to l e a r n through
experience that the
rights a n d living stan-
dards of t h e masses to-
day c a n no longer b e
defended b y reformist
measures.
That is w h y w e call
for t h e return of a Lab-
our Government pledged
to socialist policies (na-
tionalisation of the m a -
jor industries under
w o r k e r s ' control a n d
without compensation,
nationalisation of the
banks, major finance
houses a n d land, w i t h -
drawal of British troops
from Northern Ireland,
etc.).
W e as well as you un-
derstand fully that the
Labour Government w i l l
be incapable o f introduc-
ing such measures,
w h i c h are the only ones
that can resolve the pres-
ent e c o n o m ' i c c r i s i s w i t h -
out mass unemployment,
closure of industry, to-
tal erasure of the rights
of the w o r k i n g class; a
third W o r l d W a r etc., i.e.
all the historical w a y s
that capitalism drags it-
self out of e c o n o m i c
crises a n d in doing s o
paves t h e w a y for the
next.
But
pose "
to
the
simply " e x -
Labour Party
without the building of
an alternative Revolu-
tionary Party w o u l d be
the grossest betrayal of
the w o r k i n g class and is
of course an antithesis
to the concept of leader-
ship.
That is why w e trans-
formed the socialist
Labour League into the
Workers Revolutionary
Party o n Sunday, Nov-
ember 4th at the Odeon,
H a m m e r s m i t h .
This involved a mass
campaign of training in
M a r x i s m a n d recruit-
ment throughout the
country in the months
before the (transforma-
tion, to give a l e a d to
those layers of the work-
ing c l a s s a n d students
w h o w e r e already ex-
periencing the treachery
and betrayals of the
present Labour leaders,
to turn them back into
their factories a n d col-
leges to fight for revo-
lutionary politics as the
only way to defend one's
democratic rights.
S i m p l y to " t r y to
bring real revolutionary
politics to the working
c l a s s " is meaningless
Without t h e construction
of a Revolutionary Party,
steeled in M a r x i s m as
the theory of knowledge
of the c l a s s struggle,
fighting against bureau-
cratic distortions a n d
revisionism, w i t h the
aim of taking t h e work-
ing class t o power.
I in no w a y "reject
learning through prac-
t i c e " a s y o u state and I
do not say that the stu-
dent body has already
learnt that reformism
leads to defeat, I simply
pointed out that this
was the lesson of the
grants campaign s o f a r
and should be conned
by vote and actualized in
the building of a n e w ,
revolutionary Ieadership
in N U S to ally with the
working class in a politi-
cal fight to bring d o w n
the Tories.
To call t h e 5 % grant
cut that w e received
due to the £20 increase
insult w e received from
the Tories " n o t a d e f e a t "
is t o completely distort
the meaning of the w o r d ,
and leads one to adopt
the political position
that the Stalinist N U S
leadership d i d not betray
the willingness to fight
of the 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 w h o
mobilized in support of
the grants campaign.
The 5 % grant c u t
constitutes a further
attack on our living stan
dards by the Tory G o v
eminent a n d one w h i c h
cannot b e tolerated in
view of t h e current i n -
creasing rate of inflation
w h i c h will "necessitate
further attacks as the
e c o n o m i c crisis deep-
ens.
O w i n g to the c o m -
plete lack of any politi-
cal position that y o u
hold being stated in your
letters, your criticisms
of the Y S S S and S L L are
of an eclectic unproduc-
tive nature w h i c h i s
borne out by your c o m -
ments o n democratic
centralism in the SLL. I
trust y o u w i l l forward
names, d o c u m e n t s or
any other form of proof
for your allegations or
else they w i l l be re-
assigned to the growing
heap of slander and libel
that i s fast being pro-
duced b y enemies of the
working class.
I refer you to Lenin's
" L e f t - W i n g C o m m u n i s m
— a n Infantile D i s o r d e r "
if y o u are still unclear
about our position of re-
turning a Labour Govern-
ment pledged to social-
ist policies.
If y o u were to state
your political position
(for your references to
Gerry Healy s h o w that
you are not unknown to
revolutionary politics)
then this correspon-
dence c o u l d continue in
an enlightening produc-
tive manner, a n d w o u l d
also elucidate any ideas
I might harbour about
your signature being a
pseudonym.
