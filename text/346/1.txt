PURPLE PITCH
T h i s w e e k I have d e c i d e d to write
a totally unpolitical P a t c h , a s I think
that there is a great d e a l within t h e
U n i o n w h i c h w e must begin to sort
out. T h e main item at the moment is
the behaviour of a great n u m b e r of
our students at parties a n d the like.
I have a l w a y s given students t h e
benefit of the doubt w h e n it c o m e s
to their behaviour a n d attitude to
their n e i g h b o u r s , a n d also those
w h o a r e w o r k i n g for the benefit of
the students, but unfortunately,
o n c e o n e h a s seen the aftermath of
" S t u d e n t f u n " then o n e b e g i n s to
w o n d e r h o w thoughtful students
really are.
After a while o n e e x p e c t s to s e e
b r o k e n glasses, b r o k e n bottles,
s o m e litter a n d o c c a s i o n a l l y a little
d a m a g e , but this term w e have b e e n
getting into the state of w a l k i n g u p
the s t a i r c a s e s a m i d t h e s t e n c h of
pints of vomit, urine, a n d w h e n o n e
enters the toilets finding that s o m e
c o n s i d e r a t e student h a s d e p o s i t e d
h u m a n e x c r e t a u p o n both the floor
a n d also the walls. I c a n , if I try very
hard s e e that o n c e a p e r s o n is
p i s s e d a n d is desperately trying to
i m p r e s s h i s friends, that this type of
display c o u l d b e very funny ( H a .
Ha.) but I think that if this s a m e
p e r s o n w e r e to find himself with the
unenviable task the following morn-
ing of having to c l e a r u p t h e m e s s
w h i c h he h a s made, then t h e situa-
tion w o u l d b e s o m e w h a t different.
W e have got to t h e state at t h e
moment w h e r e the c l e a n e r s a r e
about to refuse to c l e a n a n y of the
" S t u d e n t a r e a s " at a l l u n l e s s some-
thing is d o n e about the o b n o x i o u s
c o n d i t i o n s in w h i c h the r o o m s a r e
left. I a m not e x a g g e r a t i n g w h e n I
say that s o m e of t h e c l e a n e r s have
b e e n k n o w n to m a k e t h e m s e l v e s ill
by trying to c l e a n the shit a n d vomit
off the floors after student parties
the p r e v i o u s night. Y o u may say that
the w a y of preventing this kind of
trouble re-occurring is to get h o l d
of t h e c h i l d i s h prat w h o is c a u s i n g
the m e s s a n d m a k e h i m c l e a r it u p
o n c e h e is sober, b u t unfortunately,
unless one could d o a vast amount of
analysis throughout t h e college,
then it w o u l d b e very difficult to
trace the o w n e r of the aforesaid ex-
creta.
I a m afraid that if this is b e c o m i n g
the ' n o r m a l ' w a y for a student to be-
have, then I w o u l d like to r e c o m -
m e n d to o u r A c a d e m i c Affairs
Officer that he a p p r o a c h the B o a r d
of studies with a view to inserting in
every student's s y l l a b u s a c o u r s e in
' C o m m o n d e c e n c y , a n d h o w to a c t
like a n adult'.
T h e p r o b l e m is not merely o n e of
filth a n d squalor. T h e r e is a l s o the
p r o b l e m of n o i s e at parties, a n d
e s p e c i a l l y e x c e s s i v e noise after
11.00 at night. I w o u l d not d o u b t
that a party without m u s i c w o u l d , for
many, b e very boring, a s they a r e
not great c o n v e r s a t i o n a l i s t s at the
best of times, but d o e s this noise
really have to begin at around 1 0 0
d e c i b e l s a n d i n c r e a s e in direct pro-
portion to the a m o u n t of a l c o h o l
c o n s u m e d ?
W h y s h o u l d it b e that I a m getting
on a v e r a g e t h e threat of o n e indict-
ment e a c h w e e k either from the
area around the college or from the
area around the Hamlet gardens
flats?? I fail to s e e w h y I s h o u l d be
c a l l e d from my b e d at 12.00 mid-
night to quieten a " P a r t y " i n Hamlet
gardens, a n d w h e n I p h o n e the flat
there is n o o n e o n t h e other e n d of
the p h o n e w h o is c a p a b l e of answer-
ing t h e question " C a n I s p e a k to
s o m e o n e in c h a r g e of the party". In
fact o n e e v e n i n g last w e e k I spent
almost 20 minutes trying to g e t
through to the o r g a n i s e r s of a party
in Hamlet g a r d e n s , a n d I got n o
other reply than from t w o d r u n k e n
buffoons o n the other e n d of the line
trying to chat e a c h other u p . This
was, I might a d d after 12.00 mid-
night.
It might s e e m o b v i o u s to most
s e n s i b l e students that m y a c c u s a -
tions a r e only a i m e d at that absolute
minority w h o s e e m i n c a p a b l e of c o n -
d u c t i n g their lives i n a n adult m a n -
ner.
A s a final note to all, b y a l l m e a n s
have a g o o d time a n d get the best
from your time in University, but for
g o o d n e s s sake, P L E A S E c o n s i d e r
those a r o u n d y o u , both your fellow
students, your n e i g h b o u r s , a n d a l s o
those w h o a r e w o r k i n g for the g o o d
of the students within the c o l l e g e
(ie. C l e a n e r s e t c . ) . ,
U n l e s s s o m e drastic re-thinking
on behalf of the o r g a n i s e r s of par-
ties e t c . is done, the only solution
will b e for the U n i o n to take discip-
linary a c t i o n against those p e o p l e
w h o a r e s p o i l i n g t h e lot of the rest
of t h e student body. It is unjust for
a minority to influence d e c i s i o n s
against the majority.
A s a p l e a t o a l l t h e students of t h e
college, it i s in your o w n interest to
prevent other students from c a u s i n g
a d i s t u r b a n c e in a n y way. T h e only
real w a y of m a i n t a i n i n g d i s c i p l i n e is
for every student to a c t a s a d i s c i p -
line officer, a n d keep things under
control. P L E A S E H E L P U S T O H E L P
