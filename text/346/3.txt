" W h a t do we w a n t ? "
— " H i g h e r g r a n t s . "
" W h e n do w e want
t h e m ? " — " n o w ! " These
cries of desperation rang
out along the national
grants demonstration
last W e d n e s d a y after-
noon.
A b o u t 1 0 , 0 0 0 stud-
ents from all over the
country turned up for
the march from Malet
Street to the Depart-
ment of Education and
S c i e n c e b u i l d i n g near
Waterloo Station.
Prominent on the
march w a s a large ban-
ner from the London
Federation of Trades
C o u n c i l s a m o n g the
many thousands of plac-
ards, college banners
and a miserable faded
green banner from the
Y o u n g Liberals.
They portrayed a
large range of political
consciousness: for ex-
ample the cynical radi-
cals from L S E w e r e
shouting " L o g i c a l posi-
tivism in, i n , i n ! " , a plac-
ard from Phillipa Faw-
cett college read " S t u -
dents eat b o o k s " and
those few students from
King's (more than from
IC I might add) that
managed to wrest t h e m -
selves away from their
heavy tomes on theology
were shouting " G e n e r a l
Strike, Tories O u t ! "
But they refused to
budge and the only con-
cession they made to
the power of the 1 0 , 0 0 0
students was to add 12
mounted policemen (on
horses) to the already
3-deep layers of men in
blue outside the D.E.S.
headquarters.
A t the rally M a x M o r -
ris (of the National
Union of Teachers)
made the somewhat
cryptic statement that
Margaret Thatcher is
" m a r c h i n g resolutely
backwards into the fu-
t u r e " after expressing
his " s i n c e r e a d m i r a t i o n "
for her only a few weeks
ago.
Speakers also came
from tenants' move-
ments, trade unionists
and old age pensioners,
but were only listened to
by about 5 0 0 students
who engaged at times in
furious heckling against
the Stalinists and Lab-
our lefts.
M a n y students d i d
not bother about the
rally realising the futility
of the rehash of hack-
neyed drivel that has
been flung at them every
time so far, and yet
w h i c h has w o n them a
munificent 5 % grant cut.
However on the basic
question of higher
grants, despite the
efforts of N U S to ensure
that not many people
turn up by 'ate publicity
and bad organisation
(there w a s only veteran
Stalinist a n d T V starlet
J u d y Cotter to organise
the M a l e t St. d e m o ) ,
1 0 , 0 0 0 students turned
up mainly from teacher
training a n d the smaller
colleges to s h o w their
determination to fight for
higher grants.
N.B. according to the
" E v e n i n g N e w s " the
number on the d e m o was
7,500, the source of
this discrepancy might
have something to do
w i t h the f o l l o w i n g . . .
Frances the N U S Press
Officer asked a police-
man how many people
he estimated were on
the d e m o , his reply was
" a b o u t 1 0 , 0 0 0 . " How-
ever w h e n he s a w her
go into a telephone box
to make a call he dived
in after her a n d presum-
ing her to be a journal-
ist said that if she was
c a l l i n g her newspaper
then s h e ' d better say
7 , 0 0 0 !
T h e G u a r d i a n ' s repor-
ter was not w a y l a i d in
this w a y a n d said that
about 1 0 , 0 0 0 students
were there.
IC was singularly
well represented there
w i t h a massive turn-out
of 15, well done, that's
one in the eye for St.
J o h n Stevas!
After all the exhorta-
tions from Pres. N o r m
Sayles in last w e e k ' s
Purple P a t c h , to make
sure the d e m o is w e l l
supported, N O N E of the
U n i o n Exec, joined the
demo.
Students must realize
that the N U S leadership
in the c o m i n g period
w i l l fight tooth a n d nail
to h e a d off a n y struggle
w h i c h must of necessity
become a fight against
this Government. T h i s
will be further borne out
by their m o t i o n s a n d
amendments in the N U S
Margate Conference.
HIGHER GRANTS FOR
POSTGRADUATES
Sign the Petition!
W e , as members of
imperial College, feel
that w e must a d d our
voice to those w h o have
spoken up about the
present anomaly of the
Post Graduate grant.
F o r Post Graduates in
London, the problem is
particularly acute. Ever
s i n c e the London
weighting was abolished
in 1 9 6 2 by the upgrad-
ing of the award for all
other P G students in
the country, the real
value of the award has
been a I lowed to fa 1
1 to
the point where London
P G students are unable
to live w i t h i n their
means.
The A s h b y report of
1 9 6 2 stated that the P G
grant should be sufficient
to a l l o w a P G student to
enjoy a standard of liv-
ing higher than that of
a typical undergraduate.
A l l w e ask is that the
P G grant be tied to the
U G grant by the ratios
proposed by N U S , so
that account is taken for
the fact that P G students
have to pay for food,
clothing and a c c o m m o -
dation for all 52 w e e k s
of the year. T h i s should
a l l o w a P G to enjoy the
same standard of living
as a U G as w e l l as auto-
matically providing a
London weighting, a
benefit enjoyed by all
other members of the
University.
T h o s e w h o state that
the present low level of
grants is fair because
the P G grant is not
means tested should re-
member that parents
have already financed
their children for 3 years
as U G ' s . Surely this
support s h o u l d not be
increased to 6 years?
P G students carry out
a major proportion of
the research carried out
in British Universities.
This contribution should
be a c k n o w l e d g e d by a
major revision of the lev-
el of the grant for the
next triennium.
PETITION WORDING
The undersigned call
upon the DES to make it
part of their p o l i c y to
include a London allow-
ance in the awards to all
persons studying for
higher degrees w h o are
registered as students of
the colleges a n d schools
of London University
and all colleges in the
Greater London area.
This is a copy of a
petition for higher post-
graduate grants. It is to
be signed by all ICPGS
and hopefully by Sir
Brian as w e l l .

For the attention of
M e s s r s . Corbyn, East
a n d V e a l l : —
W h a t does C E F E con-
sider are a person's bas-
ic rights? Does the
" f r e e d o m " of s o c i a l i s m
a l l o w a man freedom to
hold bis o w n idealism,
e.g. have a religion
(which a socialist should
consider reactionary and
illusory.)
If the answer is " y e s "
then explain the action
of all known c o m m u n i s t
regimes against ideal-
ism.
If the answer is " n o "
then please explain
whether (a) s o c i a l i s m is
an idea! around w h i c h
men must be m o u l d e d ,
i.e. c l a i m i n g to be abso-
lute truth therefore ideal-
ism); (b) s o c i a l i s m is an
ideal to be m o u l d e d by
man, the material w o r l d
etc.
MAURICE MOLONEY
Editor's reply to the open
letter to CEFE
C E F E ' s ideas of a
person's basic rights are
somewhat confused as
they have no concept of
" d e m o c r a t i c r i g h t s " , i.e.
those rights w h i c h have
been w o n by the work-
ing class in the course of
struggle like the right to
strike, the right to a free
nationalised health ser-
vice, the right to a de-
cent standard of living,
etc. There are no such
things as rights as
things in themselves,
only rights that are w o n
in continual struggle
against the exploiting
class, a n d that are only
defended in further
struggle, w h i c h in cer-
tain periods, must as-
sume a revolutionary
character and result in
the overthrow of the ex-
ploiting class and the
setting up of the d i c t a -
torship of the exploited
class.
F r e e d o m — ? W h a t is
freedom? Is freedom the
ability to jump out of a
tenth storey w i n d o w ?
No, " f r e e d o m is the
appreciation of neces-
s i t y " as Engels put it,
and by that he meant
that subject as we are to
laws of nature, e.g. grav-
ity, disease, etc., free-
d o m is the recognition
of the necessity of those
laws, i.e. of their objec-
tive character. It is by
recognising the neces-
sity of the law of grav-
ity, i.e. its action inde-
pendent of our w i l l , that
enables us to " o v e r -
c o m e " it by the use of
aeroplanes, etc., i.e. by
the recognition of furth-
er necessities (laws) of
nature.
Engels writing the
introduction to the
" C i v i l W a r in F r a n c e " by
Karl M a r x points out that
the C o m m u n a r d s (of the
Paris C o m m u n e of 1871)
correctly abolished all
finks between the c h u r c h
a n d the state: they real-
ised " t h a t in relation to
the state, religion is a
purely private matter".
That is of course c o m -
pletely necessary — the
idealist philosophies
spring historically out of
scarcity and play an
extremely reactionary
role in any political sit-
uation and cannot there-
fore be supported by a
workers' state. A s social-
ism alone can release
a n d co-ordinate the pre-
sently available produc-
tive power a n d abolish
s c a r c i t y — i d e a l i s m w i l l
disappear in a similar
way to the early Chartist
movement w h i c h sprang
out of poverty a n d ended
through prosperity.
In the schools, of
course, a dialectical
materialist approach w i l l
be used t o w a r d s every
subject a n d the only re-
ligion that will be taught
w i l l be comparative re-
ligion taught in a dialec-
tical m a t e r i a I ist ap-
proach as part of man's
social pre-history.
The c o m m u n i s t reg-
ime's action against re-
ligion as " e x p o s e d " in
the current issue of
" V o i c e ' arises out of
the need to combat any
return to idealism in
times of Hardship during
the period of the dictat-
orship of the proletariat
— f o r that will not solve
the problems.
The present " c o m -
munis:." regimes are not
even socialist in the
marx s: sense of the
word e n d have to be
described scientifically
as degenerated workers'
states, where the Stalin-
ist bureaucracies are in a
similar position between
the West a n d the East-
ern w o r k i n g c l a s s as the
Trade Union bureauc-
racy in this country is
between the Tories a n d
the British w o r k i n g
class.
A r i s i n g out of that
economic position (the
Stalinist bureaucracy)
only certain e c o n o m i c
gains are possible a n d
these are only limited
ones. This produces a
lessening of t h e gains o f
the w o r k i n g c l a s s (than
are actually possible)
and also because this
naturally involves not
fighting for a n under-
standing of dialectical
materialism w i t h i n the
working class — i d e a l -
ism gains a hold a n d has
to be viciously sup-
pressed.
Although the answer
is in a limited sense
" y e s " your conception
of s o c i a l i s m is (of
course) incorrect. S o c -
ialism is not an ideal in
the sense of a Utopia. It
is a stage of social
organisation of man-
kind w h i c h is necessary
to run the present pro-
ductive forcss and devel-
op them further. It is no
more permanent than
was feudalism or slave
societies or the capital-
ist mode of c o m m o d i t y
production.
The urgency of the
fight for s o c i a l i s m today
arises out of the econ-
o m i c crisis, caused by
the contradictions inher-
ent within capitalism,
w h i c h must rosolve it-
self in fascism or social-
ism.
Having ^rasped t'~at
and decided upon fig. t-
ing for s o c i a l i s m , then
the means, tactics, strat-
egy, etc., for that fight
can only be arrived at
out of a dialectical mat-
erialist approach to the
class struggle a n d its
history.
A l l other means result
in f a s c i s m .
