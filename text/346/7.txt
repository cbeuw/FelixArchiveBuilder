RE-INTRODUGIN
THE
ROOM
AT
THE
TOP
RATT
N o t many people travel
via the top floor of the
U n i o n to Lower Mooney
when coming from the
"college" side of Prince
Consort R o a d . Accord-
ingly, the R . A . T . T . has
not been designed t o be a
medium for publicity or
instant communication.
That is a job for Felix
and S.T.O.I.C.
It is, however, largely a
"self-help" system for
most of the things that
most students want to
find out about.
What Is There?
I.C. Travel Bureau to
share the counter space
with N.U.S. Endsleigh In-
surance.
M r . E . Meacock, who
organises the Careers L i b -
rary i n College Block has
sent across to the U n i o n
a good deal of literature
about future careers. This
is not intended i n any
way to replace the fuller
selection over i n the Car-
eers Library i n the C o l -
lege Block, but is aimed
at those students w h o d o
not have any specific ca-
reer aims, but want to
browse around i n a n i n -
formal atmosphere, and
only go to the Careers
L i b r a r y when they have a
specific request: T h e Car-
eers Section will be
supplemented by more
display racks to be sup-
plied b y M r . Meacock.
Brian Childs, the A c -
commodation Officer, will
be putting up the addres-
ses of flats for those of
you wanting to change
flat/digs. Hopefully, he
will be displaying litera-
ture to guard you against
the legal hassles you may
come across.
F o r those of y o u who
don't particularly want to
look for any information,
but just browse, there is

quite a lot of reading
matter u p there. T h e
U n i o n subscribes to many
other societies, and often
receives magazines, etc.
from them. This is where
you can find them.
Comfy chairs and sofas
(Never mind the age,
just look at the quality)
and a coffee machine are
provided (Follow the i n -
structions on the coffee
machine explicitly!).
What else can the room be
used for?
F m not sure the room
should be used for " w i l d "
boozy parties, but more
sober events are ideally
suited to the room.
Meetings, mini-lectures
or talks, would be wel-
come to use the room,
which will be bookable
via Jen. Really, it's u p to
you, you've got the room
there, use it!
Prospects?
I think we are a l l i n
favour of fully using the
U n i o n Building, a n d it
may seem that at this
stage i n the year, y o u
could well say that no-one
really knows where the
room is, what it's for, or
how people can be per-
suaded to use it. T o be
quite honest, I don't really
expect i t t o get off the
ground this year, not even
next year, but eventually
it will happen. Students
aren't patient as a rule
but for this to work, you'll
just have to be! The prob-
lem of students not know-
ing where the room is will
be solved in October next
session. T h e Registry is
always overcrowded in
the first 3 days of an aca-
demic year, with the two-
fold problem of registra-
tion plus associated en-
quiries and the issue of
grant cheques.
I have arranged for the
Registry to give out grant
cheques v i a the counter
facilities i n the R . A . T . T .
In case y o u forget this
room after this desperate
visit for your cash, y o u
may require an N.U.S.
card. Those will be also
available f r o m the
R.A.T.T. for two and a
half weeks after the
cheques have been issued.
Then, most oeople will
know where the room is
and what it's for.
Below are a few words
from a f e w of the
R.A.T.T. participants. If
any of the services I men-
tioned are inadequate,
please let me know, and 1
shall endeavour to reme-
dy the situation.
Yours,
P a u l Jowitt
