RUFFNECK TING' RECORDS PRESENTS SUBSTANCE
SPECTRUM + + + +
D
j D a z e e and M a r k e e (pic-
tured) make up the label's
core p r o d u c t i o n unit as
Substance and over the years have
contributed the bulk o u t p u t . This
a l b u m c o m p i l a t i o n s h o u l d be
regarded as a chapter in the produc-
tion history of these two artists.
Ruffneck Ting Records was l a u n c h e d
in 1993 as a natural progression of
the now legendary c l u b nights of the
same name. I got the chance to have a
chat with them about the ideas behind
the album and about that rare breed -
the female D] / Producer.
JP: Tell about the ideas behind this
album.
Markee: It's basically about getting our
dues. W e ' v e been putting out 12"s for
years n o w but they don't get the coverage,
so we have taken s o m e of the strongest
releases from our back catalogue as well as
four totally new pieces. Also with doing an
album y o u haven't got the pressure of
making tracks for the dancefloor, it gives
you more freedom.
We've got a strong crew here and
we've been here since the beginning a lot of the
artists w e have here are reaching breaking point
and there're ready to blow up big time but w e
need the backing of a major to help take us to
the next level this album should d o that. With
things like videos it's hard to d o it with out the
backing or the experience but we've got all the
ideas it's just the backing.
Dazee: As the name suggests this is an album
designed to cover the drum and bass spectrum,
from phat jump up numbers like L.F Ant; deep
sci-fi rollage of Own Way too the sassy funk of
Westside, a collection that covers all styles.
Dazee, has it made it easier getting DJ work
being female?
D: N o not really because most of the clubs I play
at it's either me. Rap or E m m a - it's like a token
female DJ. I have to fill in n o w and then for
them, they have to have the token female.
Why do you feel there are so few female D|s
and producers?
D: I don't think it crosses a lot of girls minds
they know what they like musically, there are a
lot of girls that love the scene as y o u can see
from the crowds. I don't know why but I've
always liked doing blokes things I suppose I was
a bit of a tomboy when I was younger.
How would you describe your sound, Dj wise?
D: Bouncy, funky stuff mixed up with s o m e dark
stuff, I like a lot of musical stuff. I think that
works well with the more minimal and darker
tunes, flowing in and out over each other.
Is your producing sound different?
D: N o t really, I'm just c o m i n g to terms with
the w a y I'm producing, and getting my
own sound, which is like quite a lot going
on.
Do you still get a buzz out of Djing?
D: O h yeah, if I didn't it would be time to
| stop.
How did you get into producing?
D: W e wanted to make tunes that w e
wanted to play.
Favourite Djs?
D: Randall I love the w a y he structures his
sets and Andy C rocks.
Producers?
D: Andy C, Krust, Roni Size ' n ' crew and
Decoder."
You've been playing abroad a lot what's
the scene like in other country's?
D: Well I've been playing in N e w York, Paris
and A m s t e r d a m recently and they are
mainly small clubs that have a core follow-
ing. In NY they are well clued up on all the dub-
plate culture, calling for the rewinds and all that.
Thanks to Dazee and M a r k e e for the chat and I
wish them well, don't forget y o u can catch
Dazee playing all over the place but mainly at
Ruff Neck Ting Bristol and most of the major
events like Dreamscape and Helta Skelta.
Basically this is a ruff and diverse album that
is well worth a listen and I believe it is only being
released on C D as all the singles that haven't
already been released will be shortly. The only
downside for me is that the C D isn't mixed but
then again I'm sure s o m e people prefers it that
way.
