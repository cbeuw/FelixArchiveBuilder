A Mayor for London?
You Decide.
JEREMY THOMSON
The whole of London will be
asked to turn out to vote in a ref-
erendum this Thursday to answer
the question 'Are you in favour of
forming Greater London
Authority, made up of an elected
Mayor and a separately elected
Assembly?' If the vote is passed,
which looks highly likely, L o n d o n
will have a powerful and unilateral
body consisting of a M a y o r and 25
officers installed by 2000.
The mayor's office will be
responsible for overseeing the
police, transport and planning and
will coordinate the activities of the
individual boroughs. It will be able
to launch cross-capital initiatives
such a Riverbus service, which has
not been possible since the Greater
London Council was abolished by
Margaret Thatcher ten years ago.
Although the government's full
plans are not yet known, it is likely
that the mayor and his officers
would be elected seperately, prob-
ably on four-year terms. They
would have an estimated total bud-
get £3.2 billion, though expendi-
ture may well be limited by
Whitehall.
The political race to find candi-
dated for the position of mayor has
already started. Labour M P s and
ex-GLC members Ken Livingstone
and G l e n d a Jackson have both
declared their intention to stand,
with the strongly socialist Ken
Livingstone winning public support,
if not that of his o w n party. The
Conservative Party are also waiting
before naming an official candi-
date, though possible future may-
ors include Chris Patten, Stephen
Norris and Chris Smith. The tory
peer, despot, author and charlatan
Jeffery Archer has also been highly
vocal in his campaign to become
the mayor of London. However,
public opinion is against him and
he may withdraw if not selected as
the official Conservative candidate.
Several independent candi-
dates have also declared their
interest including Greg Dyke, for-
mer controller of T V - A M and LWT
and H o w a r d Marks, former drug-
baron turned protester. The p o p u -
lar business t y c o o n Richard
Branson is also highly favoured in
opinion polls, but denies that he
will stand due to vested interests.
The vote will take place from
8 a m - 9 p m Thursday 7 M a y , and
everyone currently resident in
London, including all students in
college halls, is elegible to poll.
Residents of Southside Hall can
collect their voting cards from the
mail racks in the security lodge. For

helpline on 0 8 4 5 607 0598.

explained staff have to c o m e to
terms with a new integrated cur-
riculum as well as the new multi-
disciplinary laboratories and the
open-plan offices. There will be a
lack of time for adequate training
of staff, explined Prof Edwards, and
and many of them will be forced to
reorganise their holiday if the delay
is accepted. H e stated that they
were "still trying to place pressure"
on Schal to honour their current
agreements.
The Director of estates, Ian
Caldwell was focussed on "trying
to minimise the impact on staff"
and felt the solution lay in "looking
at contingencies". H e took a posi-
tive point of view saying " W h e n it's
finished it will be a stunning build-
ing", but was reluctant to comment
on the performance of Schal or the
penalties they may face.
N e w s i n Brief...
ASBESTOS CLAIM
COST £150,000
Imperial has f o u n d itself
£ 150,000 out of pocket, after set-
tling out of court with the w i d o w
of James Lewis, a former lecturer
at Imperial killed by an asbestos
related disease.
Mrs Lewis claimed that her
husband died as a result of years
of exposure to asbestos in work-
shops, where asbestos was being
cut up for use in lagging lab
equipment. M r Lewis died of the
lung condition mesothelioma five
years after taking early retirement
in 1988, at the age of 57, having
lectured in M e c h a n i c a l
Engineering for thirty years.
The case had the backing of
the largest higher e d u c a t i o n
union, the A s s o c i a t i o n of
University Teachers, w h o had
funded the expensive legal battle.
The A U T w e l c o m e d the outcome,
saying that the case raised con-
cerns over h o w many teachers
and students might still go on to
develop asbestos related illness-
es. M r s Lewis also drew attention
to the wider-scale implications of
the continuing use of asbestos,
"Jim was adamant that the case
should be pursued, as asbestos
was in such c o m m o n use without
the public being aware how it
could devastate lives." The use of
asbestos in universities is still legal
in some cases, and the A U T are
calling for a change in the law to
ban the potentially fatal insulator.
MAKE-OVER FOR
GREAT HALL
Plans were unveiled this week for
a thorough refurbishment of the
Great Hall, projected to take place
this summer. The overhaul, which
is designed to fulfill the needs of
the Conference Center, has a pro-
jected cost of £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 and will
include obtaining a full Public
Entertainments License.
The plan, which still requires
final approval from the College
Buildings C o m m i t t e e , is based
around replacing the first six rows
of fixed seating with electronically
controlled retractable seating, in
the style of those proposed for
W e m b l e y Stadium. Similarly, the
front of the stage would retract
under the remaining fixed stage,
to give an overall increase in floor
space of 30%.
Additionally, a large s u m is set
aside for giving the Great Hall a
facelift, and improve acoustics.
Although the timber cladding will
remain, the plans promise "tex-
tured plastered finish, coloured to
aid orientation" and "polished
plaster to give greater visual clari-
ty". This will apparently ensure
that "quality materials ... will give
an indication of the environment
that will be expected within the
H a l l " . O v e r h a u l of toilet and
emergency provision should
ensure that the venue receives the
ents license which the Conference
Center see as vital to their plans
to develop Sherfield as a prime
Central L o n d o n conference
venue.
A final decision must be made
by I I M a y , and if the plan gets
the go ahead work should be
completed by 1 October this year.
IMPERIAL STEALS
SECOND PLACE
According to the latest survey by
the Financial Times, Imperial
College has n o w overtaken
Oxford University to become the
s e c o n d - b e s t higher education
institution in the UK.
The favorable grading recieved
by IC is due largely to its high
staff-student ratio and its ability
to attract research funds - an
average of £ 3 9 , 2 6 0 per
researcher, nearly £ 6 0 0 0 higher
than O x f o r d .
M y students "are no smarter
than t h o s e at O x f o r d and
Cambridge, they are meaner and
leaner", claimed Rector Sir Ronald
Oxburgh. In reality, the escalation
from third to second place may
have more to d o with statistical
differences between the Financial
Times study and the industry-
standard Times annual survey,
which places higher weighting on
factors such as student accom-
modation.
