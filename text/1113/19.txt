THE INVENTION OF LOVE
Lyttleton Theatre, National Theatre
G
ive me a thousand kisses,
and then a hundred more,
and then another thousand
and add five score....
W h e n was love invented? W h o
invented the love p o e m ? W a s it
Catullus, as shown above? Or was
some unknown poet w h o s e immor-
tal lines of love have been lost in
time?
Whoever it was, the play, the
Invention of Love, has little to d o
with them. This is the new T o m
Stoppard play, and like all of his
work, it is of stunning brilliance,
and shows great wit and compas-
sion. The play charts the story of A
E Housman, a scholar and a gentle-
men, through his time at O x f o r d , to
his failure to complete his degree,
to his life in the gutter as a clerk at
the patent office, through his love
for M o s e s Jackson, through his pro-
fessorships at U C L and Cambridge,
past his death to him waiting for
Charon's ferry, waiting to pass into
the Underworld, ready to meet the
poets and writers he, as a classi-
cist, has admired all his life. The
play is both tragic and comic; trag-
ic because H o u s m a n ' s love for
Jackson must always remain pla-
tonic, c o m i c because T o m
Stoppard is a very funny writer.
O n e of the quotes he uses is
from Horace, w h o dreams that he
pursued the fair Ligurinus across
the Field of M a r s , and into the ever-
flowing waters of the Tiber and
speaks of his love, and how he
would gladly lay d o w n his life for
his love. This analogy is particularly
apt, as M o s e s Jackson was a sporty
y o u n g man, a rowing Blue and a
runner.
Of course, at the time in which
H o u s m a n lived, homosexuality was
a crime, punishable by many years
in jail, as Oscar Wilde found out to
his cost. Oxford was a hot-bed of
closet homosexuals, all of w h o m
dared not speak out for fear. This
contrasts strongly with the Ancient
World, where love between men
was seen as the only pure love, and
love for w o m e n was regarded as
s o m e w h a t sordid, practical and
unaesthetic. M e n were encouraged
by writers, poets and philosophers
to take beautiful y o u n g boys as
lovers, and many boys saw this as a
career move. Aristophanes used
the idea of a ridiculous old man
pampering a pouting boy to repre-
sent the way the populous are
fooled by politicians. Juvenal wrote
an ode to boys' bottoms, and stat-
ed that "If you must shorten your
life with sexual pleasures, take it
with a boy, not a woman." Imagine
the contrast between this and the
heavily repressive Victorian and
Edwardian eras, and its' effects o n
the troubled academics.
H o u s m a n studied love in his
essays, and in his poems, particu-
larly A Shropshire Lad, and dedicat-
ed his life to his work, after realis-
ing the hopelessness of his love for
M o s e s Jackson.
This is a very g o o d play. T o m
Stoppard writes with fluency and
brilliance, and all his characters are
believable. O b v i o u s l y , to fully
understand all the literary allusions,
one needs to have studied Classical
Literature to a high degree, which I
haven't d o n e but I still really
enjoyed it. O n e of m y best friends,
who is reading Classics at universi-
ty, didn't understand all the refer-
ences, and she enjoyed herself, so
I'm sure that y o u will too. It is witty,
c o m p a s s i o n a t e and talks sense
about the hopelessness of unre-
quited love. If y o u only manage to
see one play this year, make it this
one.

SLEEPING AROUND
Donmar Warehouse
S
leeping Around is a collabo-
ration between four of
Britain's young, m o d e r n play-
wrights, M a r k Ravenhill, A b i
Morgan, Hilary Fannin and Stephen
Greenhorn, w h o originate f r o m
England, W a l e s , Ireland a n d
Scotland respectively. This play,
presented in a five night run at the
Donmar Warehouse at the end of
last term, took the form of a sexu-
al relay c o m p o s e d of a sequence of
short, dynamic scenes, each of
which portrays a different aspect of
the relationships between m e n and
w o m e n .
The scenes, set in entirely unre-
lated locations, contained no c o n -
tinuation other than the presence
in each of a character met in the
previous scene. The "character
baton" was passed alternately from
man to w o m a n , or w o m a n to man,
allowing all twelve characters to be
played by only two actors. In the
absence of any enduring plot, the
energy and movement inherent in
the play were sustained through
the onstage transition b e t w e e n
characters. This was achieved by
the use of c u n n i n g c o s t u m e
changes, and was aided by the
abstract set - a changing r o o m ,
unrelated to the situations being
portrayed, but symbolic of the con-
cept behind this piece of drama.
The acting was superb. The
actors handled deftly the many
transformations between charac-
ters, their sharply defined perfor-
mances presenting a range of con-
trasting images of sex, from the
innocent and beautiful to the dis-
turbingly graphic and mechanical.
Working with minimal props and
scenery, they succeeded in pro-
jecting a vibrant reality, which c o m -
pelled the audience to connect
with the emotions and people on
stage, despite the lack of any sub-
stantial plot.
The way in which four writers
have c o m e together in this manner
(although we're far from sure of
exactly how the piece was written)
to produce a play so involving and
enthralling, can only serve as a tes-
tament to their ability. Perhaps this
signals the need for a reassess-
ment of the current established
view that such attempts to depict
modern society achieve nothing
above the exploitation of their o w n
shock value.

PATIENCE
ICUOS Tour
I
f your idea of a g o o d holiday is
a fortnight's lying on a beach,
then don't read on. The I C U O S
tour does involve a beach and is a
fortnight long, but the resemblance
stops there.
From time immemorial (over
20 years anyway), Imperial College
Union Operatic Society has taken a
production of a Gilbert and Sullivan
operetta d o w n to Budleigh
Salterton. O n c e there, we c o n -
struct a set, manufacture cos-
tumes, live in squalor at the local
primary s c h o o l , drink huge
a m o u n t s of cider, perform ten
shows, one Sunday concert and an
in-house vendetta known as the
M i d d l e W e e k e n d Dinner and gen-
erally have a g o o d time. This year
the operetta is "Patience" and the
dates are 27 July - 1 1 August.
Budleigh Salterton is a small
town on the East Devon coast, with
a pretty, but pebbly beach, a p o p u -
lation with an average age of 105
and a world-class croquet club. It
also has a public hall, which you'll
see a lot of, a public library, which
you might not visit at all, and some
decent pubs, which you'll probably
live in. W e take over the primary
school and the public hall for the
fortnight we're there. The audi-
ences are amazing and apprecia-
tive.
So - w h y take a s h o w to
Devon? The simple answer is that
it's not like any other s h o w you've
ever done or ever will d o . For a
start, ten performances are a real
luxury. Then there's the atmos-
phere, w h i c h is astonishing.
Because we're not there to d o any-
thing else, and there are no outside
distractions, it's a bit like an ocean
cruise. Everything is very intense,
huge fun and the time zings past.
"Patience" hasn't been per-
formed for over ten years and is
long overdue for a revival. Based
on the Aesthetic M o v e m e n t , the
plot concerns two rival poets and
their disastrous effect on w o m e n .
The original Bunthorne, one of the
poets was played by Oscar Wilde
himself. The irony was definitely
not lost on h i m . The production is
set around 1890, and will heavily
feature Aubrey Beardsley type cos-
tumes and sets and Oscar Wilde-
esque type swooning and melodra-
ma. C o m e and find out more on
Tuesday M a y 5 in the Union
Concert Hall, at 7.30 p m .
