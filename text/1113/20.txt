AN ORGASMIC REVIEW OF STUNNING BEAUTY

rainspotters. Loads of 'em. At
least ten. M a y b e twenty.
Anoraks; t h e r m o s ; d i c t a -
phones; binoculars; nightsights.
They mean business.
They can't see me. I'm o n top of
the g a s o m e t e r at King's Cross,
looking d o w n towards the plat-
forms of St. Pancras. Their faces
look big and sweaty through the
rifle sight. They dodge in and out of
the cross-hair. They don't acknowl-
edge each other and they don't
talk, except when a train heaves
into view. "43012, 9 9 8 7 , 9982,..." -
I can hear their yabbering through a
radio mic I taped to the signal post.
It's a lovely weekend to be stalking
a bunch of trainspotters.
Later in the week, 1 find myself
in the middle of 'Lovecraft' at the
South London Gallery, standing in
front of a video installation called
'Battle Sounds' by Carluccio 8.
Valledor. The video purports to be
a facto-rockumentary about DJ-ing
techniques.
W e see D] Jazzie Jay drop a
needle onto a record. DJ Jazzie
spends the best part of four min-
utes explaining why his particular
n e e d l e - d r o p is w o r s h i p p e d and
adored amongst the needle-drop-
ping community. The explanation
takes place in considerable detail. I
close my eyes as Jazzie moves
from emphasising the importance
of a clean lift to expounding the
virtues of a tightly controlled flight.
I picture a herd of about twenty
Jazzie Jays huddled round a record-
deck, each with anorak and ther-
mos, dodging in and out of the
cross-hair...
Later, someone approaches the
front desk, and clearly impressed
by the content of the video they ask
if there are any copies on sale. I
move further into the gallery.
Martin Creed has installed two
breast-like protrusions on a gallery
wall. The installation has clearly
undergone an obsessive period of
perfection so that the join between
protrusion and wall is invisible, and
the texture and colour of the pro-
trusions matches that of the sur-
rounding wall exactly. I c o m e to the
conclusion that the piece must
have been executed by licking away
the surrounding wall. Picture it. The
dedicated artist licking away at an
enormous pair of smooth white
breasts as they emerge from a pre-
viously flat expanse of matt white
ALL THOSE THINGS I COULDN'T FIT IN ANYWHERE ELSE
ANTE ROOM GALLERY
Another term, another exhibition in
the Ante R o o m , " C a m p u s " . A s y o u
might expect from the title, it's
photographs of Imperial. They're
g o o d , very g o o d , I just kept o n
expecting to see a sign saying
"Welcome to Imperial College, for
all your conferance needs." It's
very tasteful and grown up, but it
isn't art. it doesn't promote any
emotions at all. There isn't all that
much to say about it really.
WHO ARE BIB AND BOB?
I don't normally d o this, ie blatent-
ly plug other peoples' shows, but
as 1 was on the guest list for the
first night, what the hell. Jerry
Sadowitz, the well known Channel
5 comedian, and Logan Murray are
in an outrageous s h o w of inimitable
c o m i c genius at the Critereon
Theatre. Called "Bib and Bob", it's
apparently extremely puerile and
funny, and would be appreciated
by students of all ages. Tickets are
Â£ 1 0 , and the show runs until the
7th of M a y . It's a late night,
(10.30pm) X-rated, seriously rude
show. Or so the press release says,
anyway.
PICASSO - SCULPTOR
AND PAINTER IN CLAY
Advance warning to all fans of
Picasso: start saving n o w . The
Royal A c a d e m y of Arts will be
emulsion.
Further on, Lolly Batty gives us
a 4 - f o o t w i d e , matt-white, 3-
d i m e n s i o n a l Ninja star called
'Arabesque1
. Its form is deeply sat-
isfying. It seems to represent the
pinnacle of shape, a shining orgasm
of perfect geometry in a world of
p r a g m a t i s m a n d c o m p r o m i s e .
There's no way that this could have
been hewn or assembled. It must
be an egg of some sort, the prod-
uct of a lengthy period of gestation
which culminated in the simultane-
ous emergence of the object and
messy destruction of the artist.
Jeff Luke presents us with a
table c r a m m e d with 'Various
Objects' - books, ornaments,
crockery. The objects have been
encased in elastic bands. Each
object is w r a p p e d to a strict pat-
tern using bands of a single width. I
imagine h o w Jeff Luke might have
spent an evening in with a few
friends, w r a p p i n g the objects.
'You've gone over before coming
under, it should be the other way
round", says Luke. "Sorry", says
Mardis-Gras bomber.
You get the point. These are
seriously obsessive works of art by
seriously obsessive people. Indeed,
that's the whole point of 'Lovecraft'
- w h y are the most creative, most
resonant works of genius born of
an o b s e s s i o n that verges on
autism? W h y d o artists insist on
existing in this narrow strip of land
between mediocrity and madness?
Take an anorak - that way,
they'll suspect nothing.

exhibiting some of his little known
ceramics in September, and they
are so g o o d , you will want to go at
least twice. Ranging from vases
shaped like birds to plates with fish
moulded onto them to giant fig-
ures, the exhibition is a compre-
hensive show of his work in clay.
M a n y of the items were donated by
the family, and have never been
seen before. Anyone with an inter-
est in Picasso must go, as the work
is truely stunning. I was lucky
enough to go to the Press confer-
ance about it, and I've seen some
of the exhibits. Even if you're not a
massive Picasso fan, they are well
worth seeing. Watch this space for
more details.
AND FINALLY.
D r a m s o c are p e r f o r m i n g Alan
Ackbourn's " A C h o r u s of
Disapproval" in the sixth week of
term. The play is extremely g o o d ,
and tells the story of an amateur
operatic group, and the various tri-
als and tribulations. I've heard that
the set is magnificent, and I'm sure
the acting will be too. Not so sure
about s o m e of the accents
though....
