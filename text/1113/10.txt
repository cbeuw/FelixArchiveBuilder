! \ J\ J elcome back to
J \ / \ g a
packed issue
V V of Clubscene.
There is so much going on I've
changed the set-up to fit more in.
You may have noticed that this
is the year of the drum & bass
album, where every label on the
scene, even the most underground
are working hard to get an album
out. I've noticed that a lot of vinyl
junkies seem to steer away from
buying vinyl albums a n d w o u l d
rather buy 12" singles.
It's not that they are too expen-
sive - £ 1 5 . 0 0 , that's three singles
and obviously far cheaper than buy-
ing the equivalent number of
singles. You normally get at least
four pieces of vinyl and with the
quality of the albums at the
moment both sides are packed with
shit-hot tunes.
I think it's more to d o with the
image of the album, I myself use to
not buy albums as I thought they
weren't as g o o d as singles for some
strange reason, but over recent
CLUBSCENE - ALBUMS
T
he latest release in the now
legendary Logical Progression
series is a double C D c o m -
prising an intense live C D featuring
the one and only M c Conrad & DRS
by far the best M c ' s on the planet
and a second C D of Studio Exclusive
(9 un-mixed previously unreleased
tracks) chosen by the main man
himself LT] Bukem. Or for the DJs
out there the triple vinyl is a
absolute must if you can find it, you
get 6 of the 9 Studio Exclusive that
are on the C D .
CD 1. Intense touch d o w n with
the full live drum & bass experience
and are joined by an all star cast gui-
tar, bass, sax and drum players to
produce a sound that effortlessly
jumps from a live band in a jazz style
too a more computer orientated
rolling D&B sound. You can tell this is
live not only from the cheering
years this has changed and I've
saved a fortune by buying albums
instead of just singles.
Some that have already been
released that are more than worthy
of a mention are Enforcer Beginning
B r The End 'R> inforced), a top class
V p B f r a f i b n up there with the
tmm\hiti&S£r
Box Set, Renegade
Hardware Quantum Mechanics ruff
as you like, Juice's more than ade-
quate mini album and Ram's-
Moving Fusion compilation it's ruff,
tough and dangerous. These are all
out now and if you haven't checked
these out you'll be missing some of
the most important and innovative
works of the year so far.
With one eye on the future
there's even more to look forward
too with albums from the one and
only LTJ Bukem and also from DJ
Krust of the Represents massive,
both solo albums that I can't wait to
hear Krust's album should be out
June-ish, and Buke m a little later in
the year. Also look out for
Formations-World Cup 98 compila-
crowds but also by the way the live
instrument players seem to get a bit
carried away at times. They have got
the length, and timing of the live
breaks just about spot on, as soon as
I start thinking that Sax or what ever
is getting a bit much it stops and
you're back to the smooth rolling
beats. Good Times Bad is I suppose
as much a jazz track as D&B it's
amazing how they create the D&B
sound using what sounds like a
mainly live band. With the vocal dex-
terity of Conrad and DRS (the M c ' s
with the most lyrics) are the icing on
an already very sweet cake.
C D 2- Studio Exclusive.
Disappointingly this C D isn't mixed
but that is where the disappoint-
ments stops. Nine shit-hot totally
original deep melodic tracks from
the cream of Goodlookings artists:
Blu M a r Ten, Blame, Tayla, Big Bud,
Artemis, Seba and Bob Saundz. For
the vinyl lover the triple vinyl pack is
a must if you can hunt down a copy.
These tracks will not be released as
12" at all so miss these innovative
collection of tracks at your peril.
All in that typical GL style rolling
dreamy breaks most are easily hard
enough to work in the club environ-
ment. A n d unlike many tunes c o m -
ing out of GL these are quite easy to
mix with they just roll into each
other. Jo Public
tion with tracks from all the major
nations in the world cup. That is
coming out to coincide with the
world cup around June.
O
ver the Easter break it was
nice to see The Ministry O f
Sound putting on a decent
night for a change. Hold on! that's
the second night that was worth
going to this year what's going on. 1
know it's hard to believe but a cou-
ple of months ago Renaissance was
in the house and a few weeks back
the Logical Progression crew
passed through for one of there rare
appearances. It was wicked to hear
Bukem play out again and Blame
and Seba did their reputations no
harm at all.
But this night did remind me
why 1 hate the Ministry so much -
with such hiendly security, stupid
rules and thi- place;'was just too
rammed for most 1 should imagine,
Nothing like it was w h e n they did
their regular monthly nights d o w n
there last year. I hope they change
Astralwerks. Various Artists
(AstralWerks) •••1/2
This is a collection from the
AstralWerks label with tracks from
Will W e b , A q u a r h y t h m s ,
Gearwhore, Q-Burns, Space-time
Continuum, and Freaky Charka. The
styles covered are soft techno too
deep tech-house sort of things.
There are a couple of weak tracks
here such as La La La that let the
compilation down a little but apart
from this it's a O K selection of
tripped out breaks 'n' beats.
Ninja Cut 3. Funkungfusion
(Ninja) • • • •
A double C D boasting some 31 off-
the-wall tracks - the best from the
vast array of talent passing through
the Ninja camp. With tracks from
such names as Chocolate Weasel,
A m o n Tobin, Kid Kola, The
Herbalizer, Coldcut, DJ Vadim & DJ
Food to mention but a few. This is
not really aimed at the die hard Ninja
fan as they will already have most of
the tracks but a good introduction
for the uninitiated to the immense
diversity of sound that is Ninja.
King Kooba. The Imperial
Solution. •••
I expected this to be in a d o w n beat
style, but It's not it's nearly all drum
& bass fairly melodic some tracks
reminiscent of N o o k i e ' s style.
There's also some harder drum &
bass tracks here not really aimed at
the dancefloor but more deep mov-
the venue for the next one when
ever that is. Sticking with all things
Bukem if y o u haven't already you
must check his new EP and a most
a w e s o m e m i x e d compilation
Progression Sessions that shows
how a DJ should work it and with
the M C with the most lyrics Conrad
it has to be the best thing I've
brought this year.
O n Saturday 9 M a y there's only
one place to be if your into the
Garage scene as the originator and
probably the biggest Garage nights
of the past years La Costa Nosta is

Garage DJs. Info/Tickets 0836 581

ing tracks that you can just sit back
and drift along too. I must warn you
that in the middle of this album it
goes a little strange with some
funky breakbeat jazzy laid back
grooves that I don't feel work that
well (tracks 5 & 6 ) after this it gets
back to the inspired D & B numbers
and finishes on a much better down
t e m p o track.
Sadie Glutz. The Boy From Outer
Space. (Silver Planet) • • • •
This is the debut album from Sadie
Glutz and it defies characterisation
and can only be described as heavy
sample based quality electronic
music with influences from acid,
hip-hop, breakbeat, hardcore and
earlier techno. It goes in one direc-
tion that shoots off at tangents, you
get the rough with the smooth. All
in all a very complete album. Look
out for there collaboration with
Colognes Air Liquid later in the year.
Full Force mixed by Kenny Ken.
(Most Wanted) • • • •
28 tracks mainly big phat pieces of
D&B seamlessly mixed together by
the nice guy of drum & bass. This
should satisfy both underground
and commercial buyers alike as all
the tracks are big underground
tracks but aren't inaccessible to the
commercial buyer, acks also feat
from Grooverider, Jonny L, DJ Suv,
Prisoners of Technology, Phantasy,
Aphrodite, DJ Rap and many more.
