CLUBSCENE - CLUB REVIEW
METALHEADZ @ THE HANNOVER GRAND
•
W
hat can I say? If you're a
drum Svbass fan, it does-
n't get any better than
this. M e t a l H e a d z are once again
leading the w a y with their first
Friday of every month nights d o w n
the Hannover Grand. A s near to the
perfect as you're likely to get.
The sound system is the loud-
est 1 have every heard a n d crystal
clear with it, it's not that surprising
as Eskimo Noise supply the system.
W e were sitting o n
the balcony as far
away from the
speakers as y o u
can get a n d y o u
could still feel the
pressure vibrating
parts that others
can't reach.
You c a n
expect to hear the best DJs in the
business the first night w e went
d o w n there w e heard Digital w h o
played an awesome set, Randall
w h o rinsed the place as usual a n d
finally Fabio rolled the night to an
end. Three different styles not what
I w a s expecting but a pleasant sur-
prise as all styles were covered the
way I like it.
The next month I w a s there
again this to hear Kemistry &.
Storm, JJ Frost fresh back from the
USA and finally D o c Scott. Yes this
night is so g o o d since I went the
first time a few months back I've
back every month a n d I'll be there
tonight t o o fir J MaJika.Ray Keith,
Fabio &. Doc Scott.
The lighting is also shit-hot as
you might expect adding that little
bit extra, especially with the w a y
they build with the music to a d d to
the atmosphere. I must mention
the misting machine they have here
it's wicked no sticky throat drying
smoke but a fine mist is sprayed at
high pressure from a tube that runs
the length of the ceiling that also
acts as a refreshing cool breeze as
it c o m e s out with such velocity. It's
the little things like this that make
all the difference from being an
alright night to a wicked night.
Nice to see G o l d i e bowling
about the place as well, it must be
a t o p buzz being the m a n behind
such a spot o n night.
The only down-side begin that it
is a little expensive to get in - £ 15
(but that's only 5 0 p a day) drinks
aren't cheap £ 3 . 5 0 a bottle of beer
and I advise y o u to arrive early as
this night often gets roadblocked.
You won't find many piss heads in
the place a n d y o u only get people
there w h o really want to be there
no attitude just people that like
their music real.
Don't forget that y o u can catch
Goldie n ' crew d o w n the Bluenote
each a n d every Sunday if once a
month isn't enough for y a and it's a
little cheaper.

CLUBSCENE - SINGLES
WX\'A:\ !
Sniper. Cross fader Dominator
(Bullion Rec)
This has been receiving rave
reviews from a number of big name
DJs in the big beat area a n d seems
to be set for great things. It's a hard
mix of breaks, beats &. s o m e fucked
up guitar business that all sounds
all right in a hard busting sort of
way. This is a g o o d track but I'm
not sure if it justifies all the hype.
Freddy Fresh. Down For The Count
EP (Eye Q)
Freddy keeping it fresh with anoth-
er funky selection of d o p e d up
beats ' n ' breaks. Plenty of scratch-
ing, spin backs a n d general
turntable t o m - f o o l e r y . If y o u
missed the scratch mix s u p r e m o
Essential mix o n radio I where he
squeezed in over 100 tunes, don't
be t o o up set as he's back o n our
side of the p o n d the first two weeks
of M a y , playing amongst others at
The End, W C 1 a n d Cream-Fields.
Skylab. Magenta EP (Eye Q)
Three tracks, the first sounding like
a mix of thrash metal guitar with
d o w n t e m p o beats a n d a weird
female vocal. The brave, second is
totally opposite slow-paced serene
track with beautiful dream female
vocal. The third track Bite This is a
super edit of the hard to find 7"
from 97.
Eskovah. Come To Me/ Long Time
Smoker (Colorstone)
Back to a similar style to their first
release of a large-ish female vocal
with tough ' n ' quite dark beats. Few
d o this as well as Eskovah a n d I've
been playing this one to death.
O n c e you've caned this side y o u
can turn it over a n d get stuck into
the flipside which is just as g o o d .
] Raq. Waff 4 the bass / Molecule
(Fullcyde)
A massive track that's been rinsed
all over the place. Rolling-stepping
'n' building beats in that Fullcycle
style but it's still as individual a
track as your likely to find. Double
bass runs alongside a clever flexed
sub-bass a n d plenty of fx a n d little
noises to keep y o u interested.
Blu Mar Ten. Butterflies & Moths
(720)
Another skippy dreamy s u m m e r
afternoon of a track from Blu M a r
Ten rapidly establishing himself
with the G L c a m p . Strong atmos-
phericals as y o u would expected
c h o p p e d up beats a n d a subtle
bassline. Firm favourite with the
likes of Blame Fabio.
Coldie. Believe (Metalheadz)
Grooverider does a superb job o n
the remix and I wouldn't be without
it. It starts out in a deep intelligent
style a n d then after the breakdown
the style is totally changed to a
phat b-line monster transforming
the track.
Serious Danger. High Noon
(Fresh Rec)
Strong western tendencies ride
alongside those speed sort of style
beats, ragga lyrics, gunshoots a n d
phat rolling sub bass. That sounds
slightly d a t e d n o w . 3 different
mixes using different bass lines a n d
a previously unreleased vocal mix
of Deeper thrown in to the bargain.
C-Flame & Mr.G. The stylus EP
(Metalbox)
This double vinyl pack is just what
I'd been waiting for, as I like to play
progressive sets from garage too
banging house. These are great
bridging tunes they fit neatly
between different styles / tempos
of tracks. A d d e d bonus there are no
lyrics so y o u can roll it in behind
heavy vocal numbers with out hav-
ing to worry about vocals over
vocals. All have a deep US house
feel, full marks for originality.
Ray Hurley feat Donna
Cousinson. Just Yourself
(Confetti)
Vocal &. d u b mixes nice vocal, dis-
tinct voice that sounds a little
strange at first but definitely grows
on y a over time. Well ahead of it's
time as already been out for a few
months now but sounds bang u p to
date. The voice complements the
key changes very nicely a n d xylo-
phone that c o m e s in after the first
break is just what it needed to keep
it going wicked little track.
Equator. Silence (Bosca Beats)
Hard house at it's best, with build-
ing filtered horns a n d beats to
match, a uplifting yet m o o d y feel to
it. I heard this played out a few
weeks back and the place went bal-
listic. M a d l e y gets o n the mix on
the flipside taking it off in a differ-
ent direction with a spacey tinge,
both work equally well massive
tune.
Lectrolux. Mind The Gap (TEC)
I'd call this tech-house, tough beats
go at a fierce pace, touches of acid
keep it in a hard style. After the
break it c o m e s back even harder
than before and getting more acidic
as it progresses a n d if this isn't
quite what y o u wanted y o u also get
remixes from C o m m a n d e r T o m a n d
Knukleheads so if there should be
something for all house fans.
Blu Peter. Tell Me What You Want
(React)
Blu Peter &. React you should know
what to expect a first class bang-
ing/tech-house track, with strong
acidic overtones. Flipside starts out
sounding like a drum &. bass track
and s o m e h o w ends u p as a full on
banging house track very clever,
and just what I needed a D8J5-
house cross over track.
