WOBEGON BOY
Garrison Keillor
BOOKS 1 M a y 1998
L
ake W o b e g o n is a small t o w n
in M i d - W e s t America, with
t w o types of p e o p l e ,
Lutherans and Catholics. In Lake
W o b e g o n , car ownership is a mat-
ter of faith; Lutherans buy Fords
from Bunsen M o t o r s , Catholics buy
Chevies from M a i n Garage.
Lutherans eat at the Chatterbox
Cafe, where the waitress, Dorothy,
is always going to make something
of her life, move to Minneapolis,
become a singer, live a little before
she dies. Lutherans drive to St
Cloud occasionally to catch a
movie, but not too often, y o u k n o w
that's g o o d money you're s p e n d -
ing, we could d o something useful
with it, like repaint the barns.
Lutherans marry young, and tend
to stay married, putting up with
each other in suffering silence, the
w o m e n making endless quantities
of unwanted food, the men retreat
into little worlds, where they collect
huge quantities of useless junk,
reluctant to throw anything away,
you never know w h e n it's g o n n a be
useful. Lutherans suffer impossibly
hot summers and frozen winters
stoically, G o d willing they'll see
another year, and w e must all be
thankful for small mercies.
Lutherans are decent honest folk,
descended from Norwegians w h o
fled N o r w a y looking for better
weather and better land in the N e w
W o r l d , and w o u n d up in Lake
W o b e g o n , longing for the old coun-
try, learning Norwegian songs and
dances, eating lutefish, and cele-
brating long forgotten Norwegian
holidays. Lutheran men are heavy
built, slow thinking, deep breathing,
slow talkers, w h o can make a sen-
tence last a week. They don't talk
much, hey, why waste your breath
saying nothin'? Ridiculous. They sit
on benches and clear their throats
loudly, a n d proudly, with their
stomachs hanging out, their best
friends, who've been with them at
some of the best moments of their
lives. From this claustrophobic and
close society comes John Tollefson,
w h o as a child dreamt of escape.
John Tollefson, the son of Byron
and Mary, leaves Lake W o b e g o n
for upstate N e w York to manage a
radio station at a college for the
academically challenged children of
financially gifted parents. H e falls in
love with Alida, an independent
w o m a n from Boston, w h o loves
him back, but refuses to marry him,
exalting the joys of the single life,
and gradually learns to love and
respect the people he grew up
with, and the society he comes
from.
This is where the book begins
to fall apart. Garrison Keillor writes
fluently and well about the people
of W o b e g o n , but his soft style and
gentleness sit strangely with the
brashness and harshness of the
N e w Yorkers. The book is at it's
best when John goes back to Lake
W o b e g o n for his father's funeral.
The description of his father's
death encapsulates the integrity of
M i d Western Americans.
"Dad died on the next-to-top
basement step on his way upstairs
from having taken to the basement
a box of rubber binders that Mother
had told him to get rid of... While in
the basement, he fetched a bag of
peas from the freezer in the laundry
room.. And then disaster struck as
he climbed the stairs. Dad suffered
from arrhythmia, and as he
approached the top, he must have
lost his breath. He sat down...A
moment later, and he was gone,
slumped against the wall, the bag
of frozen peas in his right hand. His
eyes were open, and he was dead.
Mother sat on the stair beside him
and put her arm around his shoul-
ders and smoothed his hair and
stroked his face and kissed his
cheek. She told him she loved him
and always would love him. And
then she took the frozen peas from
his hand, and put them in the
refrigerator."
It is writing like this that encap-
sulates the soul of America and
turns it into a place y o u ' d like to
visit. This book isn't as g o o d as
previous W o b e g o n books. I feel
that Garrison Keillor has lost his
way somewhat, and is struggling to
write a book with a small town feel
in a big city. That said, it is a very
g o o d book, and I r e c o m m e n d it to
devotees of Lake W o b e g o n . To first
time readers, I'd say, read Lake
W o b e g o n Days or Leaving H o m e .
The portraits painted of the small
town are irresistible, and the peo-
ple echo characteristics of the peo-
ple y o u know and love. Please, M r
Keillor, go back to Lake W o b e g o n ,
and tell us more about Arlene, Irene
and the t o w n ' s largest tomato,
twenty-four ounces, to the Sons of
Knute and the Living Flag, to the
Norwegian Bachelors, with their
unbelievable unpleasantness.
These are the people you know,
and the people you've taught us to
love.

aving read the blurb about
this book and it's author I
started it with hopes of a
quality read. Unfortunately disillu-
sionment soon set in. Having got
past the first few pages of clumsy
quasi-philosophical/scientific ram-
blings the reader is plunged into a
description of the family life of an
adolescent girl, lsobel Fairfax, and
her neighbours, as narrated by
Isobel herself. Don't get me wrong,
there is nothing w r o n g with this in
itself, the account is in fact so
bizarre as to become horribly con-
vincing; as w e are slowly told of the
o d d people and o d d happenings in
the Fairfax household it seems to
b e c o m e more and m o r e real.
Unfortunately the key w o r d in that
last sentence is "slowly"; in the first
half of the book virtually nothing
happens. Okay, so Isobel gets
thrown into a few stray timewarps
and her stepmother begins to go
insane, but that's hardly enough to
sustain the reader's interest for half
a book is it?
The whole of this first half of
the book does however serve to
s h o w how the entire Fairfax family
lives under the shadow of Eliza,
Isobel's mother w h o disappeared
when Isobel was a child. In the
second half the pace of the book
then takes a definite turn for the
better and, as well as things actual-
ly happening to Isobel, we start to
see the history of the mysterious
Eliza. Except it isn't that simple
because w e also start to get thrown
around in different timelines, and
told histories which aren't strictly
accurate, or are even totally false. 1
have to admit that the story does
get more absorbing as it goes o n
and that the final separation of fact
from fiction is done skillfully, leav-
ing the reader satisfied but
depressed.
So it's a g o o d story, but is it a
g o o d book?, I hear you ask. Well,
not particularly. In addition to the
slow start there is a definite prob-
lem of things which distract us
from the storyline without adding
anything to it: the pretentious ram-
blings 1 mentioned as occurring at
the beginning unfortunately pop up
sporadically throughout the book.
Kate Atkinson seems to feel that
she is making "deep", insightful
comments on the nature of the uni-
verse, but it tends to c o m e across
as being almost meaningless. She
also says things occasionally which
are obviously meant to be "clever"
c o m m e n t s but, well, they just
aren't. Even worse than this are her
repeated references to classics of
literature, w h i c h , rather than
enriching the book, serve to high-
light the fact that the authors of
those works were far better at their
jobs than she is. Not really the
effect she wanted I think.
