ohn Grisham has a knack
for creating a g o o d read
and so far all of his screen
adaptations have been d e c e n t
films. This c o m e s despite the glar-
ing similarities of his story lines,
which all display a tendency to
end-up with a David versus Goliath
court-room battle.
Rudy, played by M a t t D a m o n ,
is the newcomer to the ups a n d
downs of the litigation in M e m p h i s '
American courts, a place where the
lawyers are as abundant as the
prostitutes and 'where the only dif-
ference is that the pro's stop
screwing you for m o n e y after your
dead'. Rudy dives into the deep
end as his first client takes o n an
insurance company w h o refuses to
pay for his leukemia treatment. O u r
legal Goliath is played by Jon
Voight, an intimidating adversary
for our inexperienced lawyer but
during the court case Rudy expos-
es the greed a n d corruption of a
company that offers security but
never pays out. The Rainmaker is
not quite the Perry M a s o n of court
cases but steps back to a n e w c o m -
ers point of view as Rudy has t o
learn court etiquette o n the job.
As the saying g o e s , d o n ' t
become involved with your clients.

RAINMAKER
Starring: M a t t D a m o n , Danny DeVito, Claire Danes, Jon Voight, M i c k e y
Rourke, Dean Stockwell
Director: Francis Ford C o p p o l a • • • •
Matt Damon stand's up ruth, justice and the American way.
Our n e w lawyer's inexperience,
youthful ideals and the desire to d o
g o o d , however, lead h i m into the
opposite direction. Rudy becomes
involved with a w o m e n with an
abusive husband, and persuades
her to apply for divorce, a n d rents
an apartment from an old lady w h o
he has advised on her will. All these
are little details that could have
been washed over in the final print,
but I'm glad they remained.
The Rainmaker was directed by
Francis Ford C o p p o l a , a n d he does
M a y 1998
a superb job of developing the
characters a n d creating the e m o
tion of the film. The Rainmaker
however, is totally different fron
The Godfather or Apocalypse Nov
which were created with his hear
and soul, a n d after his recent film:
such as Dracula and jack y o u star
to wonder if he needed a film tha
w o u l d carry h i m to glory, rathe
than the other w a y round. The
casting is the only strange point tc
this film, John Grisham's book:
tend to have a huge number o
characters that play s o m e impor
tant role, a n d with the screer
adaptation of The Rainmaker i
large array of well know ' B ' lis
actors have been given fleetinj
parts in the film. M i c k e y Rourke
plays a lawyer w h o puts Rudy or
the payroll before being indicted b\
the FBI and making a speedy exit tc
the Caribbean. Dean Stockwell is i
judge w h o dies shortly into the
film, a n d Virginia M a d s e n is a dis
gruntled employee w h o helps Rud\
to expose the insurance scam.
To put it simply, The Rainmake
is a g o o d film with an excellent plo
- but s o m e m a y say that films car
never compare to books.

THE BIG LEBOWSKI
Starring: Jeff Bridges, John G o o d m a n , Julianne M o o r e , Steve Buscemi
Director: Joel C o e n • • f

Jeff Bridges is The Dude, a man who
redefines the phrase "laid back".
A
s ever with the C o e n broth-
ers, their latest film has very
little in c o m m o n with their
last. Having jumped from romantic
comedy to thriller to film noir t o
black c o m e d y in the past, The Big
Lebowski, leaps in a whole n e w
direction, c o r r e s p o n d i n g t o n o
known film genre.
Jeff Bridges is The Dude, the
ultimate laid back American, living
in a trailer-park, philosophising and
bowling with his stark raving m a d
Vietnam vet b u d d y , John
G o o d m a n , a n d inept, weasely
Steve Buscemi. It's a part that
Bridges must have dreamed of all
his life, so closely does it match his
real life persona (interviews portray
him as s o m e o n e happy to be an
"ageing hippie"), a n d o n e he slips
into perfectly. G o o d m a n t o o relish-
es the ability to completely h a m it
up - playing the ultimate trauma-
tised vet, still living out the Cold
War - although director Joel C o e n
carefully avoids the temptation to
slip into farce.
Somehow, he gets caught u p in
a kidnapping case, w h e n he is mis-
taken for a millionaire recluse of
the s a m e name. Charged with
handing over the cash that will
secure the return of the millionaires
y o u n g wife, disaster after disaster
strikes. G o o d m a n , by turns psycho-
pathic a n d coldly c o n f u s e d , is
intent on taking o n the world. But
the millionaires pseudo art-freak
daughter, a very scary prospect in
the shape of julianne M o o r e is con-
vinced that it's all a scam, and
insists that Bridges holds onto the
cash. A n d then it all starts getting
complicated.
But it's at this point that the dif-
ference that the words "a film by
Joel and Ethan C o e n " create associ-
ates itself. Rather than turning into
yet another Tarantino clone, or
indeed a rehash of Fargo, The Big
Lebowski is s i m p l y different.
M o v i n g seamlessly from grim black
c o m e d y to utterly absurdist big
laughs, the story of the Dude is
imbued with the Coen's trademark
mix of gritty reality and pure fanta-
sy. This, along with an amazing
ability to instantly pick up the
m o o d a n d feel of a genre (whilst
avoiding pastiche) is the element of
that marks out all their work, from
the Hudsucker Proxy to Fargo.
O n c e again, the Coen brothers
prove themselves completely dif-
ferent to anyone else out there.
You could leave the cinema feeling
that nothing has happened for t w o
hours, or y o u could tap into their
warped genius a n d see the slick
pastiche of a genuine "everyman"
character caught up in a Raymond
Chandler novel. Q
