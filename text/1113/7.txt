ON THE ROAD TO SOMETHING UPLIFTING
PURESSENCE take time out to talk about their return to the music scene
T
he C a m d e n Falcon's Bar Fly
night is the venue
Puressence have chosen to
host their return to gigging life in
England after having traversed
Europe for a few dates. O h yeah,
and they've also been in the studio
busy creating a whole new batch of
songs for their forthcoming second
long player. The first release from
it, This Feeling was receiving satu-
ration airplay o n Radio 1 over
Easter and you w o u l d also get a
shock if you heard the strains of
Puressence playing over the top of
some annoying afternoon DJ.
It is late M a r c h and the day is
fittingly cold and rainy (generally
depressing weather, you get the
drift), the type you would assured-
ly say most closely resembles
Puressence's musical style.
Unfortunately this musical style has
seen them being accused of re-
hashing '80s gothic melodies and
you couldn't blame yourself for this
misconception. If y o u have only
heard singles like Fire and India
from their debut album y o u ' d be
convinced they are wannabe '80s
goths attempting to sneak in a bit
of p o p . If y o u have heard all the
album y o u would be a lot more
clued up to their real sound, with
absolute scorchers like Traffic Jam
In Memory Lane.
After having braved the ele-
ments I finally locate a nearby pub
where the interview is to take
place. W h e n I arrive the band are
already chatting away to a group of
journos and fanzine writers about
their new album and how it feels to
be back on the live circuit. I wait for
a slightly later chat after it's fin-
ished. Lead singer James Mudriczki
is in a talkative m o o d and he's
joined by Kevin Matthews(bass)
and Neil M c D o n a l d (guitar).
They've been enjoying themselves
gigging around Europe and eager to
embark on their UK return. James
likens their attitude to 'a geezer
w h o s e been celibate and n o w
wants to fuck.' Puressence are
keen to clear up any assumptions
about their new material, and
James says, 'Well, to us it's m o v e d
on. The first album is pretty dark. A
lot of people mistake the first
album for being very dark, but it's
not. What we're trying to d o is
write uplifting music and I think the
second album is more than the
first.' Kevin joins in, 'The last album
is about where w e ' v e been
and...you know, what we're doing
now. This album is about where we
want to be going...where we want
to be.'
Are they worried that now they
will probably be expanding their
fanbase and will soon be playing
larger venues and sacrificing the
m o r e intimate a t m o s p h e r e of
smaller places for this. James:
'Don't get me w r o n g but it's a great
fucking pub The Bar Fly, but I know
we could play larger venues. I think
it's just the fans w h o are up their
own ring pieces and get fucking
that pretentious because the band
is on a big stage. The fact is that
they're still doing the same thing.
They might be 50 miles away from
you but y o u can still be close knit.'
S o m e h o w , I don't think anyone
who's been to W e m b l e y Stadium
w o l d agree.
L o o k i n g to the future
Puressence don't seem too con-
cerned and James quips, 'I reckon
me and y o u (pointing at Neil) will
be sharing a fucking shelf in
W a n d s w o r t h for armed robbery.'
Puressence put their planned
heist on hold tonight to grace us
with a whole new safe load of
songs. The Bar Fly venue is a little
too intimate, forcing fans to watch
with craned necks round the side of
the bar. The songs sound uplifting
but the smallness of the venue
makes them s e e m constricted. The
crowd are really up for it and it
seems as though even the most
'pretentious' of fans would willingly
turn up to any large scale gig.
Seems as though you're wrong,
James.... EH Jason
THERAPY
Semi-Detached • • • v2
D
£t W*^V o n
* w a n n a look
p e h i n d me!" screams
Andy Cairns. It remains
to be seen how many d e m o n s the
Belfast child has left to exorcise.
Still angry after all these years,
there are plenty of paranoid lyrics
and angry rants. C h e c k out
Tramline where the only lyrics are
spat out again and again a m i d a
frenzy of guitar roughage, "I'm get-
ting swallowed up in all of this and
the last thing I need is s o m e rock
star bullshit." Then there's Bom
Too Soon where he comparatively
whispers "In your weakest
moments, it all c o m e s back to y o u
like a ghost."
Originally titled Ice C r e a m
Headache, Semi Detached is m u c h
better than their previous release,
Infernal Love. There's been some-
what of a slight return to the loud
guitars, huge power chords and big
fat choruses that was Troublegum.
This can be seen through the lead-
ing single Church of Noise and oth-
ers scattered around the album
s u c h as Black Eye Purple Sky, Don't
Expect Roses and Lonely, Cryin',
Only. That's not to say that
Therapy? have taken a step back;
this is definitely a progression with
a few technical tricks to enhance
the s h o w as Andy explains in an
interview, " O n Safe 1 wanted to use
a Rotovibe a n d v o l u m e pedal
simultaneously, so I had to tape
the pedals together with a plank of
w o o d . Basically, y o u have all the
pedal's electronics in your boot
soles so, as you rock back and
forth on your heels, you get a w a h -
wah s o u n d . W a h - w a h boots!
Fantastic!"
Fantastic indeed, as Safe is
probably the standout track. Semi-
detached is essentially for those
that liked Troublegum and want
more of the same with a couple of
comparatively quiet (as Therapy?
are never actually quiet; it's not in
their nature) tracks thrown in to give
some balance and diversity. I can
see them banging out a g o o d per-
centage of these tracks live and
sending the crowd into a pogo-ing
frenzy. However, as an album, on
your o w n stereo, in your own home,
it just doesn't quite cut it. H
