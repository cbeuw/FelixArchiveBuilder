Med School Bars Back
from the Brink
DAVID ROBERTS
Having been hit with a double
wham my of setbacks over the
Easter holiday, the future of the
bars at the St Mary's and Charing
Cross campuses now seems
secure. A private company, cur-
rently running the bar at the
H a m m e r s m i t h Hospital c a m p u s ,
has stepped in with a tender for
both of the other bars, and it is
expected that a deal will be
finalised during the next few
weeks.
The current system, whereby
the bars are run by the Charing
Cross and M a r y ' s Union's respec-
tively, comes to an end this s u m -
mer as part of the integration
process. The future of the bars had
until now seemed uncertain, with
both College and the Union declar-
ing themselves unable to run either
at a profit. A key issue in the recent
sabbatical elections, where all suc-
cessful candidates p r o m i s e d to
ensure the survival of the bars if at
all possible, the fate of the bars
has been something of a hot pota-
to, with responsibility continually
being shifted between the Medical
School, Union and College hierar-
chy.
Further setbacks were suffered
over Easter, with the resignation of
the bar manager at Charing Cross
suggesting that the bar might never
re-open. Questions have also been
raised over breaches of the license
at Gladys, the St M a r y ' s student
bar.
All rent and associated pro-
ceeds arising from the tender will
go to the m e d i c a l s c h o o l .
However, the prospect of a suc-
cessful conclusion to the tender
process has been warmly greeted
by senior Union figures, both at
South Ken and the m e d schools, as
it will safeguard a vital student
service. The expected deal will be
particularly g o o d news, as it offers
both a secure future for the bars for
at least the next two years, and the
suggestion of even lower bar
prices.
A n announcement is expected
on the deal very soon, bringing to
an end one of the most problemat-
ic issues surrounding the medical
merger.
Revellers reach Trafalgar Square in the pro-cannabis rally on 28
March. The protest, organised by the Independent on Sunday news-
paper, attracted and estimated 20,000 people. Gathering first in
Hyde Park, the march proceeded down Park Lane and east along
Piccadilly, halting traffic in the city. At Trafalgar Square, the cam-
paigners were met by bright sunshine and speeches from celebrities
such as Rosie Boycott (loS Editor) and Howard Marks. Although
joints were being smoked openly by many, there was no police action
and the day passed peacefully and enjoyably. Photo: Paul Hard
