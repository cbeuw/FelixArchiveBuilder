THE TAO OF JOURNALISM
ARTS 1 M a y 1998
WAY OF THE WARRIOR
Peacock Theatre
W
ay of the Warrior w a s
intended to be a cultural
show, proclaiming martial
forms as artistic; an ambitious and
challenging project, presenting a
wide variety of martial arts in
understandable ways to a p r e d o m -
inantly western audience.
The show started well, with
Kalarippayattu, an art native to
South-West India. The moves were
well practised, and included vari-
ous weapon forms, including the
sword, dagger, staff, shield and
flexible sword. Empty hand moves
were included in the performance,
both in their o w n right and as
responses to weapon attacks. It
was surprising then, that the expo-
nents themselves did not appear as
fit and well-toned as one might
expect of martial artists. The
forms, however stylised for the
show, were obviously effective and
well executed.
Next came Krabbi Krabbong, an
art from Thailand in w h i c h the
artists presented a performance of
"The M o n k e y King". This is where
the show started to lose its way,
and I found it very difficult to tell
whether the dance was farcical
because of the content or because
of the very p o o r performance.
There was virtually no real martial
art involved; all the action took
place in a totally choreographed
fashion, reminiscent of a cheap
imitation of the Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles.
This was followed by Pencak
Silat, one of many Indonesian fight-
ing styles. Various displays of both
w e a p o n and empty hand forms
were performed, including s o m e
excellent examples of pinning and
trapping techniques similar to |udo.
A few of the performances were
individual; disappointing, as with-
out the application, the technique
becomes fairly meaningless to the
uninitiated.
Starkly contrasting with the pre-
vious play, Beijing O p e r a were
excellent. A l t h o u g h p e r f o r m e d
entirely in Chinese, the play was
absorbing, funny and extremely
well acted. The players used sim-
ple, though decorated, staffs to act
out a scene from "Fighting Jiao
Zan" and showed how well the
martial arts can be incorporated
into theatre.
Kabuki, Japanese Classical
Theatre, is almost completely
unfathomable without a g o o d
understanding of the background,
and was correspondingly very hard
to follow. It was evident that it was
regarded as a purely theatrical
form, despite the use of a
Naginata, a halberd. The w e a p o n
was used solely as a prop, not as
an exhibition of the training. This
was extremely disappointing, as I
practise laido, in which Naginata
are sometimes used, and watching
this was akin to watching s o m e o n e
play air guitar while listening to Jimi
Hendrix. I a m sure that Gojo
Masanosuke is very g o o d at Kabuki
performance, but he is an actor,
not a martial artist.
Then the high point of the
evening arrived, Shaolin Kung-Fu.
This was a display of excellent mar-
tial skill, marred only by the lack of
application. All the forms were
shown individually, but with such
precision and feeling that one
could not help but be impressed.
Although very g o o d , it also brought
the whole show into sharp per-
spective. C o m p a r e d to the Shaolin
monks, all the other acts paled into
insignificance, and I couldn't help
wondering whether this was the
whole point. W h y had none of the
other main arts such as Tae-Kwon-
Do, Karate, judo, or Wing Chun
been demonstrated? This is surpris-
ing w h e n one considers that many
of these have their U K headquar-
ters locally; just five minutes walk
from the theatre, anyone can train
with an 8th Dan Karateka. I became
even more cynical when, on leaving
the theatre, I discovered the whole
of the Shaolin Kung-Fu group out-
side, signing autographs.
Putting m y cynicism aside for a
moment, there were s o m e impor-
tant aspects presented. Martial
Arts are just that: forms practised
by skilled artists, whose expertise
bears no relation to street thuggery.
Without philosophy and devotion
to study, the martial arts degener-
ate into no more than foolish pos-
turing. Thus, shows such as this
might be considered the best way
to present these Arts: not as c o m -
petitions but as exhibitions of skill.
The only true way to a test a fight-
ing form is to fight until only one is
left standing, not a prospect that
m o d e r n societies encourage. In
this, the most important point was
not explored: the True W a y of the
Warrior is to win without a fight.

BIEDERMAIMIM UN DIE BRANDSTIFTER
Goethe Institute
T
he European Theatre
Company, under the direc-
tion of Sabine Bauer, recently
presented their touring production
of " B i e d e r m a n n u n d die Bran-
dstifter," (known in English as "The
Fireraisers,") Frisch's satirical expo-
sure of the human reluctance, or
even inability, to acknowledge the
presence of danger, no matter h o w
obvious. The plot of the play is
largely transparent, the eventual
outcome obvious from the begin-
ning, which means that w e concern
ourselves less with the events being
played out before us, an more with
the meaning behind them. The play
was performed in German by a cast
of mixed German and English ori-
gins, with the Greek-style chorus
spoken in English.
The play, set in a city plagued
by arson attacks, charts the d o w n -
fall of the wealthy Herr
Biedermann, ("Mr. Worthy,") w h o
despite his constant complaints of
the level of arson in the neighbour-
hood, appears blind to the possibil-
ity of his falling victim to the that
very thing. Biedermann feels oblig-
ed to take into his home the retired
boxer Schmitz, w h o plays on all his
perceptions of moral obligation,
and w h o s o m e h o w evades all sub-
sequent suggestion that he leave.
He then invites his accomplice,
Eisenring, to join him, and together
they begin the preparations for the
burning of the Biedermann resi-
dence, making no attempt to con-
ceal their activities.
Here the role of chorus is
played by the ever watchful fire
brigade, "die Waechter der
Vaterstadt," w h o must be constant-
ly alert to signs of fire. Frisch's cho-
rus differs from the Greek chorus in
that its members are no longer
impartial observers, being in the
employ of the townspeople. Since
the chorus was spoken by most of
the company, the use of English
served both to separate it from the
characters of the play a n d to
heighten its detachment from mor-
tal goings-on. The speeches of
Frisch's chorus are characterised by
highly rhythmic poetry, here
accentuated by sharp movements
of the head and body.
The play is p e o p l e d by
grotesquely inflated characters,
and these were brought out by the
stylised acting of the whole cast.
The cast made use of much exag-
gerated m i m e , w h i c h , although
requiring considerable skill, enabled
them to present a stylised view of
the actions portrayed whilst retain-
ing some degree of reality.
A s the play reaches its
inevitable conclusion, we witness a
hideous scene in w h i c h B i e d -
ermann a t t e m p t s to a p p e a s e
Schmitz and Eisenring through an
invitation to a dinner of goose.
During the meal, the two fire raisers
bait Biedermann by openly dis-
cussing their activities, and the hys-
terics of Babette and Biedermann's
i m p o t e n c e reach new peaks.
Biedermann is finally g o a d e d into
lending Schmitz his matches, and
we are left with a cacophony of
explosions a n d sirens from
throughout the city.
The company employed many
devices to increase the effect of the
play, and to bring out the humour
within it. The staging was particu-
larly effective, with the loft in which
the fire raisers stored fuel and laid
their fuses separated only by a
slight difference in height from the
Biedermann dining room, so that a
certain mental leap was required to
separate the events occurring in
each. The portrayal of the fire rais-
ers themselves, as carrying out
their actions in a very calm and
deliberate fashion, almost as a
game, s e e m e d to hint that they,
detached from humanity, would
achieve their aim of destruction by
fire with or without human inter-
vention. This production certainly
succeeded in achieving Frisch's goal
- to present us with a parable of
this particular human folly, and to
leave us with m u c h to consider.
