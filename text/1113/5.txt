So here w e are again. O f course,
some of us never left, stoking the
Imperial fires while y o u lot took it
easy. But enough of m y moaning.
If I said that y o u had missed m u c h ,
I would be lying, since virtually
nothing has happened. The B M S
moves closer to completion and is
now officially late but under bud-
get, and that's about it. N o scan-
dals, little gossip, apart from the
suggestion that the H e a d of M a t h s
left in order to fulfil his ultimate
goal of returning as Rector, and no
huge money wasting, over and
above the norm, of course. In fact,
life here has been a bit boring. I
trust y o u will rectify that.
Having lived in the s h a d o w of
Oxbridge since its foundation, it
would seem that Imperial is n o w
starting to make s o m e real
progress, m o v i n g into s e c o n d
place, comfortably a h e a d of
Oxford a n d within a point of
Cambridge, a c c o r d i n g to the
Financial Times survey. This is
obviously very g o o d news. These
things tend to be self-perpetuat-
ing- as w e become better, the
money should flow at a greater
rate, putting us even closer to
C a m b r i d g e . The Rector's c o m -
ments are most encouraging, say-
ing that 'our mission is simply to be
the best...it's not a very comfort-
able place to be anything less than
outstanding...[1C
students] are no
smarter than
those at O x f o r d
a n d C a m b r i d g e ,
they are meaner
and leaner.' Praise
indeed, and justi-
fied, 1 think you'll
agree. M o s t of
our departments
are w o r l d - c l a s s ,
s o m e are as g o o d
as it gets. What a
pity that such
ringing endorsements cannot be
applied to the department that
administers the place. Sherfield is
s u p p o s e d to be an enabling force
to allow academics to d o their
teaching research, in other words
bring home the bacon. O c c u p y i n g
a secondary position, it should be
'leaner and meaner' than the rest.
As it is, it is overstaffed, inefficient,
often self-serving and the master
rather than the servant. While aca-
demic departments, which have
been so fulsomely praised in this
survey, are forced to survive on
budgets that barely match infla-
tion, Sherfield
ploughs its fur-
row, in w o n -
drous isolation
from the realities
of life. W h e r e
many academics
have offices
more suitable to
the storage of
b r o o m s a n d
paint s c h e m e s
reminiscent of
the S w i n g i n g
Sixties, our lords
Suite Five enjoy
and masters in
opulent a c c o m m o d a t i o n refur-
bished only a few years ago. A s
has been shown by the medical
merger, the e x p a n s i o n of the
College does not lead to real ratio-
nalisation of the administration, as
would happen in the real world,
but the creation of mickey mouse
jobs for those displaced
from positions that even
IC could not justify maintaining.
W e r e Sherfieid's ability to miss
golden opportunities mirrored by
the academics, w e w o u l d be run-
ning the M o n t e s s o r i School a close
second in terms of research. Sir
Ron is clearly serious about
becoming the best, so why does
he tolerate such loss-making bas-
ket cases as Catering. W h y does
he want the place cleaned by a
hugely overstaffed cleaning
department, secured by our o w n
security people and maintained by
an Estates Division of several hun-
dred? M a n y of the medical cam-
puses are s h o w i n g the way, man-
aging their affairs with the mini-
m u m of contracted staff. As I have
said once or twice, w e are g o o d at
teaching and research, not flog-
ging exorbitantly priced sarnies.
Sort out that lot, and y o u create an
organisation lean enough to
become the best.
