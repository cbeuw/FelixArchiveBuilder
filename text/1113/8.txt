PULP
This Is Hardcore •••'/2
M a y 1998
No longer of a differ-
ent class, now Pulp
get hardcore...
A
nd so Pulp c o m e back from
their three-year hiatus. Last
time we heard them, Jarvis
and c o m p a n y were playing us the
Mercury Award-winning Different
Class and they were showing us
their commentary on our o w n lives.
You know, work pressure, living a
stressful life, strange sexual perver-
sions and that sort of thing. It was
a m u c h more mature album than
His 'n' Hers and it s h o w e d that
there was more to Pulp than the
p o p leanings of Common People,
and a darker side got partially
unveiled. With This Is Hardcore,
that darker side c o m e s out far
more.
Jarvis' background as a film stu-
dent at Central St. Martins has
never been more prominent in the
songs than this. Each track is
almost like a story in itself - as
usual, commentaries on the less
c o m m o n sides of life. The Fear
opens up the album and may well
seem long and drawn out on the
first listen, but after a while, it starts
to sit comfortably. It lacks that p o p
thing that Pulp d o but y o u don't
really notice. Could it be that they
have started to write songs that are
not easy to listen to? Pulp? C o m e
on, they can't be doing that can
they? Let's start looking at the
other evidence. The title track, This
Is Hardcore seems to l o o m in the
distance as Candida Doyle plays a
bleak piano plays a sparse melody
underneath the t i r e d - s o u n d i n g
vocals. This is amongst many
tracks that s e e m to have been
inspired by some fifties B-movie
and even the promotional video
matches this idea. There are tracks
that, o n the surface, give an
impression that they're about some
sort of domestic chore (Dishes) but
open up to reveal a whole lot more
than any initial thought. It almost
seems as if they've let y o u into
their beautifully-tended back gar-
den where everything seems too be
a little too perfect. All the grass is
m o w n and the borders are perfect.
But you know that it's all a bit rot-
ten at the core somewhere. The
next stone you turn over will be
seething with some horrible crea-
tures.
There are those tracks that are
also a bit hard to understand in the
context. Help The Aged is one of
them. 'Help the aged, don't just
put them in a home/It's not much
fun when you 're on your own.'
A h e m , excuse me? Is this the
Common People for the crusty
generation or something? It is
g o o d , though. Sylvia seems to be a
teen m e m o r y song that's strangely
reminiscent of Something Changed
from Different Class and other cool
tracks include, Pretty Hard and A
Little Soul.
So, back to my initial question.
Is it difficult to listen to? Then
answer is a resounding maybe.
M a y b e it is for the first few times
but after that, it starts to get better
and burrows into your mind. It's a
scary thought really. H

MOKE
Superdrag
S
tuck in a foreign country and
without the services of the
worldwide w e b over the holi-
days, I was powerless to find out
any background information about
M o k e . This is a shame as I liked
them and wanted to find out h o w
long they've been around and if
they've got any other stuff out
there. I'll resist the temptation to
make any idle A u d i o w e b compar-
isons straightaway as M o k e man-
age to pull out a diverse bag of
tracks.
The opener, Sleepyhead, is a
loud beginning and is m u c h like
mid-album track Wheel in Motion.
Both have a heavy bassline and a
groovy feel to them. A Black Grape
c u m A u d i o w e b - s t y l e delivery
(Whoops!) lends itself well to these
songs. There's other kids round the
musical block, however. D o w n is a
cool and initially quiet number that
occasionally strays dangerously
close to Bon Jovi but we'll let them
off just this once. In Your Dreams is
a beautiful bittersweet ballad.
"Motherly eyes. Fatherly smiles. I
will scare you in your dreams." The
haunting lyrics, are in clear contrast
to the pacified music that is occa-
sionally tinged with some Indian
strings for g o o d measure. Mislaid
the Key is a traditional blues n u m -
ber with accompanying customary
hammering riff and a rising vocal
volume that culminates with the
cool "/ feel I hold the answer and I
know it's here in me. I realise I'm
locked out.... I think I might have
mislaid the key." Powercut is pow-
erful stuff but I don't think it's
unfair to say the chorus is so much
like Rage Against the Machine that
it could be called Bombtrack Part
Two. That's not to take its power
away from it, as it's still a rousing
number.
M o k e are one of those bands
that you're glad you found, as
there's a lot to like. However, after
a while I just grew tired of them, as
they b e c a m e m o r e familiar.
Initially, Superdrag turns out to be
anything but. I don't think this'll
stand any test of time, though.
Have a listen rather than go out
and buy. H

w f dysfunction is our func-
I tion then I must be some
& kind of genius," screams
J.S.Clayden, lead vocalist (chief
warble-iser would probably be a
more accurate term) with
Pitchshifter and boy is he not
fuckin' kiddin'. I feel obliged to
swear, as although this album is
swear-word free, I have a sneaky
feeling that the Pitchshifter live
experience, which I'm sure it would
be, would be littered with exple-
tives not to mention testosterone
fuelled teenagers trying to knock
seven shades of shit out of each
other. The more bruises the better.
For those w h o don't know what
Pitchshifter s o u n d like already,
here's an attempt at a description:
Imagine a juggernaut p o w e r i n g
through your home with speakers
attached to each wheel spewing
out noise at a m a x i m u m volume,
half of which is distortion. Think
punk, think anti-establishment,
think chainsaw guitars, think tech-
no, and think huge dirty and heavy
industrial machinery. Think of four
people that have just escaped from
the local asylum. N o w , let these
nutters stick all of the above ingre-
dients into a melting pot. Let them
chew and digest it and y o u could
safely say that this album is what
they w o u l d vomit it into your face.
Intense, angry, anti-social and
dysfunctional are all flabbergasting
understatements. Pitchshifter can
produce only one of three func-
tions, w h i c h probably tell y o u
something of your character. One,
you can be totally disgusted and be
in desperate need of a shower to
cleanse yourself of this filth. Two,
you can b e c o m e a fan and go to
concerts where y o u can meet like-
minded people or three, you can
laugh your tits off. I'm a number
three man myself. There is actually
a saving grace, believe it or not.
There are fifty free samples for you
to steal and use in your own music.
There is, however, a fantastic
catch. You are actually asked to
credit Pitchshifter by name. You
could always lie, though. H
