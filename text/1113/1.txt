Delays in the £ 5 8 m Bio-Medical
Sciences construction project is
threatening to seriously disrupt
the medic's transition to South
Kensington this Autumn. The
building is to accommodate much
of IC's four medical schools as
well as the biology department;
the move represents a major
development in the ICSM merger.
Schal, the c o m p a n y responsible
for the venture, have claimed that
specialist c u s t o m i s a t i o n of the
building will take longer than
expected and subsequently solicit-
ed an extension of their schedule at
a recent B M S steering committee.
This follows an approved request
for deference at the previous c o m -
mittee meeting, and the building,
which was originally due for hand-
over o n 13 April, will not become
available until m i d - s u m m e r .
The matter has caused particu-
lar concern amongst medical staff
as it seems their previously m o d i -
fied plans are to be undermined
once again. ICU president Andy
Heeps, himself a medic, is anxious
to preserve the g o o d name of
I C S M especially at such a pivotal
point in its institution. H e envi-
sioned "Straight ' A ' students hav-
ing a disastrous first few weeks"
due to a lack of time for appropri-
ate staff preparation, thereby wast-
ing the effort invested in attracting
top-flight students.
O n a recent tour of the site the
U n i o n president c l a i m e d that
"workers were noticeable by their
absence" and felt the difficulties
e x p e r i e n c e d with c u s t o m i s a t i o n
should be addressed by increasing
employment. H e went on to say
that without taking specific mea-
sures to focus the project on meet-
ing targets, "the whole project will
be blown out of the water".
Phil Hilton, Schal project m a n -
ager, was quick to defend the c o m -
pany's actions, insisting the spe-
cialists c o u l d only be brought in
once the building's infrastructure
was complete, and that news of
the problems with customisation
was only recently available. H e
stated there w a s a "degree of
adaptation to the generic structure
n e e d e d " which affects 60 rooms,
this c o m p e l l e d him to request the
hand-over date be postponed from
8 June by 3-4 weeks. These mea-
sures will allow for the completion
of building and full commissioning
and M r . Hilton was certain the
delay was "nothing to d o with the
men not putting the hours i n . "
However, the Principal of I C S M
Chris Edwards, is far from satisfied
with Schal's p e r f o r m a n c e .
Describing the h a n d - o v e r post-
ponement as an "inappropriate and
unfortunate delay", he was aware
that "safety has to be paramount"
but saw a very difficult summer
ahead for the medical school. H e

Prince Albert to Rise from the Dead

The Albert M e m o r i a l will finally re-
a p p e a r next m o n t h w h e n the
extensive restoration work, which
has seen the m o n u -
ment c o n c e a l e d
behind a protective
blanket of scaffold-
ing for the last seven
years, c o m e s to an
end. The project has
seen a full facelift for
the shrine to Q u e e n
Victoria's h u s b a n d ,
who died of typhoid
aged 42, and has
been finished a year
ahead of schedule.
The project has
c o m e in £ 2 . 8 million
under budget, with
final costs estimated
at £1 1.2 million.
A l t h o u g h the
restoration work has
been d e s i g n e d to
preserve the m o n u m e n t as it
stands, rather than return it to it's
original ornate condition, it has still
required the repair and replace-
ment of over 1000 square feet of

mosaics, and the reguilding of the
major features and statues, includ-
ing the huge d e p i c t i o n of the
Prince. The final elements of the
now famous c o l u m n of scaffolding
should all have been
r e m o v e d by
October.
The m e m o r i a l
was first diagnosed
as suffering from
potentially fatal rot
in 1983, but it has
been in need of
repair ever since it's
unveiling in 1872.
The statue immedi-
ately began to dete-
riorate, polluting the
b e c o m i n g e m e r s e d
in d e a d pigeons,
w h i c h b l o c k e d up
gullies for rainwater,
causing further decay
of the structure.
