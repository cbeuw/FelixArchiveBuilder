THOUGHT FOR THE DAY
"Turn over and start, good luck."
I
t's that time of year once
more. Sales of purple and
orange pens rocket; Helix
shares double in value as sales of
transparent pencil cases and
twenty centimetre rulers grow
seemingly without limit. Other
brands affected by this bizarre
change in spending patterns
include reduced sales of Malboro
Lights (everyone switches to
Reds), Kenco seeing a dramatic
seasonal upturn, and that bitter-
tasting stuff that stops you from
biting your nails suddenly begin-
ning to shift a lot of units. I imag-
ine that campus drug dealers are
also smiling at this point in time,
and waddling down to the bank to
cash their ill-gotten gains. What,
then, causes this freak economic
event? Is it the heat? People
preparing for holidays? A sudden
C|D epidemic? Not bloody likely.
The reality is much more
unpleasant.
W h e n I, with considerable trep-
idation, embarked u p o n my GCSEs
(the certificates for w h i c h may be
readily purchased in joke shops
these days, just next to the
w h o o p e e cushions; cheers,
Westminster), my mother present-
ed me with a book, written by a
psychologist, detailing all the key
points required for structured and
sensible revision. I read this tome
carefully (it was more interesting
than learning German). Inevitably, I
subsequently ignored every piece
of advice contained therein, prefer-
ring to cram entire subjects during
weekend orgies of absorption (in
the case of Economics) or d i d
absolutely nothing (rest of sub-
jects). Does this sound familiar?
No? Methinks y o u doth talk from
within your backside too m u c h .
Due to my unshakeable belief in
the old saying, "If it ain't broke,
don't fix it", this is, of course, the
method of achieving academic nir-
vana that I have adopted ever since
(although, if I a m completely hon-
est, it was more to d o with my faith
in another old saying, "Beer tastes
better than notes"). It is for this rea-
son that the two weeks before any
major exam I take are spent in a
paranoid, neurotic, cancer-induc-
ing, lip-biting frenzy of worry. (Still
not work, you'll notice. I don't
actually start that until a m a x i m u m
of thirty-six hours before an exam).
No, I thrive by spending my time
worrying about not having done
any work. Then c o m e s Judgement
Day; no mere pieces of A 4 since
N e w t o n ' s Principia Mathematica
have had the potential to cause
such permanent and irreversible
brain damage to a student.
So in you go, usually forgetting
something important (witness a
friend of mine w h o happily strolled
into his GCSE Physics exam without
a calculator and had to ask the
Invigilator for log tables). The sus-
pense is dreadful, but everyone
else seems calm and collected.
They also d o not show even the
slightest sign of needing the bipolar
transistor formulae that y o u have
hurriedly scrawled on the back of
your hand, and are n o w desperate-
ly trying to keep clandestine.
W h e n the papers are turned
over, my advice is as follows: step
one, try not to panic. This is not
because it will distort your thought
processes, but because the sweat
pouring d o w n your forearm will
drench the answer booklet and
convert anything y o u actually do
write into an insane three-year
old's drawing of a d o g .
Step t w o is to try to keep your
heartbeat d o w n below the one
h u n d r e d decibel mark, because
pressure fluctuations greater than
this may blow everything off your
exam desk. Step three is to read
the question. Funnily enough, this
is the most difficult part of the
exam. I have been known to write
six hundred w o r d answers to ques-
tions only to find upon finishing
that an evil poltergeist has modi-
fied the question while 1 was not
looking at it.
O h , and w h e n y o u have fin-
ished the ordeal, 1 advise that you
drink so m u c h that y o u are sick.
Scientists w o u l d almost certainly
argue against this behaviour, rec-
o m m e n d i n g a decent meal and a
g o o d night's sleep. But, as we all
know, scientists have a habit of
talking rubbish. After all, you prob-
ably just wrote two thousand words
of it.

N o w that the summer has c o m e and pissing
rain and cold are fading memories I thought I'd
share a light and refreshing bijoux recipe-ette
with y o u . H o u m o u s is a spread based on chick-
peas from the eastern mediterranean which is
well worth experimenting with. It's also excel-
lent nutritionally with plenty of roughage to
keep you going. You will need:
4" 250 g dry chickpeas
4" 3 tbl tahini (pulped
seasame seeds)
4" juice of Vz lemon
T 3 cloves garlic
Â®" salt and pepper
4" a mixing/mashing/
blending/bzzz machine
Briefly rinse your chickpeas under running
water. Leave them to soak in plenty of water
(they will at least triple in size) for around a day.
Drain and rinse again. Put the peas in a large
pan, fill the pan with water and put on a low
heat without any salt. The chickpeas will take
about 2-3 hours to cook thoroughly so find a
Rembrand's famous painting Aristotle con-
templating the bust of Homer, the ancient
greek author famous for writing The
Odessey and for inventing Homous. Er...
hold on a minute...
book and watch out that they don't boil dry or
you'll end up with a layer of beautifully arranged
little balls of carbon and a horrible smell (I do it
all the time). You can speed up the cooking by
adding a teaspoon or so of bicarbonate of soda
at the beginning. Please d o not be tempted to
use tinned chickpeas. You w o u l d be badly dis-
appointed and better off just staying in bed.
W h e n the chickpeas are c o o k e d there should be
just enough liquid to cover t h e m but no more.
Place the c o o k e d chickpeas with their
liqueur in the operating bit of your machine,
add the rest of the ingredients and give it a right
old bzzzing. You can a d d optional extras like
chillis, parsley, spring onions or whatever at this
stage. M a k e sure y o u check the seasoning,
you'll probably find you've underestimated the
salt but don't let that get y o u d o w n .
If y o u can't get tahini which is a semi-liquid
paste made from pulped sesame seeds use
sesame oil instead but it is available in quite a
few grocery type shops. Scrumptious on toast.

Don't despair, Westminster Eye will return
in two week's time. Hamish Common is cur-
rently undergoing torture. (Exams).
