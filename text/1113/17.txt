ave y o u ever felt that the
universe is c o n s p i r i n g
against y o u ? W h i l e its
probably a bit premature to start
feeling v i c t i m i s e d w h e n you're
forced to wait for a bus half an hour
in the rain, Bobby C o o p e r (Sean
Penn) can be forgiven for feeling
paranoid.
O n his way to clear his g a m -
bling debts to a particularly vicious
bunch of Russian gangsters, his car
breaks d o w n close to the tiny t o w n
of Superior, Arizona. Any hope he
had of making his appointment in
time is crushed by an obstructive
mechanic (Hollywood flavour-of-
the-month Billy Bob Thornton)
who, in time honoured fashion,
doesn't have the right parts to
make a repair. Forced to spend
some time in town, it isn't long
before Bobby encounters s o m e of
the locals, all of w h o m s e e m curi-
ously familiar.
From the Patsy Cline loving
trailer trash and the world weary
sheriff to the old man, played by
Having re-defined the horror genre

returns to give the horror sequel a
damn g o o d kicking, with Scream 2

winning blend of knowing irony and
scares that made the first film so
successful. [A full review will

Jon Voight, offering sage yet
oblique advice, Superior has the full
compliment of the usual cinematic
inhabitants of a sleepy desert town.
S o m e of these caricatures, howev-

becomes involved in the tale of
deceit and double crossing at the
heart of this tense atmospheric
film.
Oliver Stone's vivid style

GREAT H
EXPECTATIONS
Starring: Gwyneth Paltrow, Ethan
Hawke, Anne Bancroft, Robert De
Niro
Director: Alfonso Cuaron
T
here were certainly great
expectations for this film in
the industry. It was due for a
US release in December so it
would have a shot at the Oscars,
but was pulled at the last minute
as the producers suddenly realised
that the chance of this winning a
statuette is zilch.
The idea of a contemporary
setting for Dicken's classic is cer-
tainly not a bad one and the first
half of the film is promising. At the
centre of the story is Ethan
Hawke, a man whose life is domi-
nated by one ambition; to w e d
and bed c h i l d h o o d sweetheart
Gwyneth Paltrow. It's not a sense-
less a m b i t i o n , obviously, but
Paltrow is one of those annoyingly
icy w o m e n w h o always flirt but
never c o m m i t themselves.
W e follow Hawke's life as he
b e c o m e s an established
Manhattan artist due, in part, to a
mysterious benefactor w h o may or
may not be Paltrow's hagged old
aunt played by Anne Bancroft. N o
matter how successful he is, how-
ever, H a w k e knows he will never
be truly happy until Paltrow is his
for g o o d .
Unlike in the novel, acclaimed
director Alfonso Cuaron focuses
entirely o n the relationship
between the two main characters.
His Great Expectations is first and
foremost a love story, with colour-
ful characters played by a solid
cast .which includes a superb
c a m e o by De Niro as Lustig
(Magwitch in the novel). The let-
d o w n is that he doesn't keep the
m o m e n t u m of the first half going
and ends up with a mish-mash of
scenes which don't fit together
well. This is c o m p o u n d e d at a
time w h e n the story should be
c o m i n g to an intriguing finale by
giving H a w k e that appalling line,
"Everything I do, I d o it for y o u . "
All in all, this is a more than
adequate love story w h i c h ,
despite the change of setting, still
retains s o m e of the magic of
Dicken's' original. The attitude of
the director to his adaptation,
however, is m a d e entirely clear
when he explains, "I would have
changed the title but I couldn't
think of anything better." Of
