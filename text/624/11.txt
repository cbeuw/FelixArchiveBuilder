Bookshop
News
|| I have been tolerant, polite, even humorous. It
obviously doesn't have any effect on the small
number of people who think that because the
Bookshop is owned by the student union, they
can just walk in and help themselves.
If we catch anyone taking Bookshop stock
without paying, we will have no alternative but
to call the police.
It is because of the past history pilfering
within the College, that we have had to
I
unfortunately install Entry and Exit turnstiles,
a security guard, goods must be put in bags,
receipts must be given. I don't like any of it but,
as trie media says, it's a sign of the times. If
anyone sees people stealing from the
Bookshop, tell me. If they steal from us, they
could steal from you.

Next Wednesday (see What's On) at 2:00pm
we shall be starting weekly workshops. These
should be a lot of fun, consisting of
improvisation, acting, games, projection
training, make-up classes, etc.
The first will be in the Concert Hall, but all of
the rest will be held in the Upper Lounge.
Everyone is welcome to come along, even
Oliviers need practice!
Those of you more interested in the
technical side of stagecraft should also come
along to the Storeroom on Wednesdays to
help build sets for our forthcoming produc-
tions.

Do you ride a bicycle or have you a bike which
you would like to ride? Ever wanted to do
more than ride it to College, or just make your
ride to College a little more comfortable? If it's
yes to any of the above you should consider
joining the newly formed IC Cycle Club.
The main activities relating to actual riding
are weekly runs for those who want just to
cycle for pleasure, race training and racing
itself for those who want to cycle for pain. The
weekly Sunday runs are already happening,
the others will follow when we get more
organised. Other plans include longer trips,
say for weekends, with this possibly including
cross-Channel excursions (when better
weather arrives).
The other main function of the club is to
provide members with the abilitiy to maintain
and improve their machines. To this end we
are already in the process of obtaining over
£300 worth of tools. This will allow members to
do anything from tightening loose nuts and
replacing broken spokes to building wheels
Hopefully the club will also soon be able to
acquire track bikes, essential for the racing
side of the club.
If you are interested, drop a note to our
esteemed Captain, Ronan McDonald (Maths
3) or come along to our regular Sunday ride
(Beit Arch at 10:00am).

Cricket
Tour
B r i l l i a n t t o u r ! F i v e games
played, one was — the rest were
either...lost or drawn. No great
cricket but John Wints scored
two 50s and Jimmy Hutton did
the bowling honours including a
hat-trick. (God knows how with
his slow left-hand crap!) First
fixture cancelled due to rain,
drove directly to Torquay on the
last Tuesday of term. Presence
was felt—booted out of 'The
Musicians Bar', picked up by.the
police when we proved very
difficult to remove from a 'night
c l u b ' especially when Phil
E a s t l a n d was a d a m a n t on
finishing the pint that he had
bought. Between arriving and
Sunday night Jimmy Hutton
and Chris Thomason downed the
fifty pint mark. A couple of
others requiring a little longer.
One night after the boys had
been on the beer—it was the
general consensus is that Garath
Fish should have a haircut.
Using nail scissors half of his
hair was removed—thanks to
being locked out of Garath's
room the job was left incomplete.
Neil Clarke was the unfortunate
subject of a classic comment
which was passed as he strode
in to bat against Plymstock:
" C o r ! Don't they grow worms
big in London!"
Rifle & Pistol
Despite a large turnout during
the first two weeks of term, good
shots are still required for both
internal and inter-university
teams. New features this year
include a club knockout compe-
tition, ladies league and num-
erous shoulder-to-shouldert
duels (Time Higgs' organisation
permitting). Some high scores
have already been registered this
term with Tim Higgs shooting a
magnificent '96' despite a poor
start to the season. (He said "It
would have been a '100', but
Steve Harrison was talking to
me!").
T o potential markspersons
who may have been put off by
the crowds in the range, please
make the effort to come along.
' E x p e r t ' t u i t i o n is a l w a y s
available.
Members are invited to attend
the open pistol competition and
club dinner, to be held on
December 1. Don't worry if you
can't shoot, Steve H a r r i s o n
(Club Captain, contact via Elec
Eng letter-racks) could only
manage 4 out of 100 at his last
attempt. There will also be a
club social division pub visit on
Wednesday October 27 (next
week) see range officers for
details.
Squash
The club already anticipates a
very successful year following an
astonishing turnout at Freshers'
Fair, both in terms of potential
membership and depth of new
talent. At the league's A G M last
week this prompted us to enter
an IC V team into the newly
formed U L U S L 6th Division,
thus hopefully enabling more
players to compete in matches
during their time at IC. Partly
commensurate with this, but
also due to other considerations
the club is actively seeking ways
of increasing its share of the
total court time available at the
Sports Centre.
The first matches of this
season were played this week;
first result—below strength
ladies team lost narrowly to
Bedford College 3-2.
The men's and ladies' ladders
are being established and will be
put up after the weekend; see
noticeboard at Sports Centre for
details.
Cross Country
The club had a very promising
start to the season competing in
the Southern Universities Cross
Country League on the first
Saturday of term. Running for
London Univ, we finished fifth
out of twenty-two teams (four of
the six scoring runners were
from IC), with newcomer Andrew
Griffiths finishing a creditable
fortieth despite running the
muddy six mile course in training
flats. In the ladies race Mandy
T i n d a l l showed that early
morning training pays dividends
by finishing second to take the
London side into sixth position.
Not bad for a 1-member team.
Last Saturday on a very wet
H a m p s t e a d Heath the club
fielded two teams in the Univer-
sity College Relays. Graham
Harker and Hugh Dixon got the
first team off to a good start but
it took a fast last leg run by Jon
Lea to bring us into the top ten,
giving it plenty of time to get
back for the all-important cross
country tea.
