F E L I X proudly presents the:
Bluffers Guide to
IC Union
To the uninitiated, the Union may appear to be nothing more than a
meeting place for hacks, a chance for self-glorification for a few
pompous individuals. The truth is somewhat different: much of the work
of the Union is concerned with the day-to-day administration of all the
clubs and societies and such 'hidden extras' as academic and social
welfare. Since there is often considerable misunderstanding or just
plain bewilderment about the various committees, Nick Pyne has set out
a brief account of how they function, their membership,'their
responsibilities, and some of their failings.
Union General
Meetings
This is the sovereign body of the Union, and
can dictate policy to any Union committee.
U G M s are infrequent, and usually bogged
down in proceedure, so a smaller body exists
to fulfil this function in mundane matters—
the Union Council,
Union Council
IC Union Council,1
' which consists of the
people whose mug shots you see here, has a
similar raison d'etre to U G M s . The idea is to
have representatives of the v a r i o u s
viewpoints likely to be prevalent in College
so that a reasonable discussion of any points
of relevance to the Union in general can take
place, and not simply be decided by the
executive.
Council is supposed to meet regularly two
or three times a term to monitor some of the
things too mundane to be
brought to a U G M , as well as to
fill gaps in policy until further
policy can be formed at a U G M .
In practice, Council suffers
from much the same maladies as
does the U G M — p r o c e d u r a l
wrangles abound and towards
the end of the year Council is
rarely quorate. The situation is
aggravated by the fact that most
people know the others present,
and there are usually few there
who are totally sober, so meet-
ings tend to drag on until
boredom or inquoracy (or just
occasionally there being no
further business) terminates the
meeting.

The Executive
Because of size (not to mention the incredible tedium and frequent
inquoracy!), neither the Union Council, nor the U G M or available to
formulate Union policy on every point that may arise in the normal
running of IC Union. This task is fulfilled (to a greater or lesser
extent) by the Union Executive Committee. This committee,
consisting of the sabbatical officers (not the F E L I X editor) and the
Constiuent College1
Union Presidents meets roughly weekly (or was it
weakly?) to decide on such points, but when necessary individual
members of the Executive will make decisions without consultation.
All members of the Executive are responsible to Union Council and
the U G M on matters concerning IC Union (though many C C U
matters are dealt with internally).
Union Finance
Committee
This is independent of Council, and holds
the purse strings for the Union. Its members
are elected by a U G M specifically to sit on
this committee which allocates grants each
year to the various subcommittees and

Subcommittees
These are generally classified
into 'Major Sub-Committees'
and 'Other Sub-Committees'.
The distinction seems to be
based m a i n l y on f i n a n c i a l
g r o u n d s — the m a j o r s u b -
committees spending most of the
money—than on any qualitative
decision as to their relative
importance.
Each subcommittee is headed
by a chairman (or officer for
Welfare, External Affairs and
Academic Affairs) who repre
sents the views of the committee
to Council.
