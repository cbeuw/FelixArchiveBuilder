Feast of Terror
Danton's Death by Georg Biichner, in a
version by Howard Brenton. Directed by
Peter GUI, the Olivier, National Theatre.
T h e t u m u l t u o u s events o c c u r r i n g in
revolutionary France in the year 1794 provide
the setting for Buchner's Danton's Death. The
period of 'The Terror', when the guillotine
seldom stood idle, provides a very fertile
ground for Buchner's penetrating observation
of two opposing forces of man.
The two central characters are Danton
(played by B r i a n C o x ) and Robespierre
(excellently portrayed by T o m Georgesonk as
a very sinister character). Danton is a one-time
national hero who stands for freedom and
sensuality, but whose passivity against the
sweeping tide of the revolution hastens his
death at the hands of Robespierre. The latter
personality, who led the revolution at the time,
represents virtue and social order. But a
knowledge of the French Revolution is not
required to appreciate B u c h n e r ' s superb
analysis of two opposing ideologies, attitudes
to life and personalities. The work is profound
and cooly analytic, turning over all kinds of
philosophical stones, but the epic drama an
a l m o s t s c i e n t i f i c o b j e c t i v i t y . T h e p l a y
represents quite an intellectual feast, but
above all the National Theatre production is
very successful at sowing the seed of doubt.
O n e finds oneself questioning dearly held
beliefs, and in this respect the play is one of the
most disturbing one is likely to come across in

Getting There
T h i s w e e k ' s o u t i n g i n v o l v e s a bit m o r e
walkabout than the last one: the Tate Gallery,
Millbank. In true British style, as you emerge
from the tube station there are several well-
meaning signposts to the Tate, but the area is
currently full of roadworks and after a couple
of hundred yeards the useful signposts are
r e p l a c e d by bright y e l l o w o n e s s a y i n g
' D i v e r t e d T r a f f i c ' . . . n o m e n t i o n of the
whereabouts of the Gallery. So I've drawn a
sketch map; it's about a three minute walk.
. The Tate houses a British Collection of
works from the sixteenth century to around
1900 and the National Collection of Modern
Art: this consists of works by British artists
born after 1850, and of foreign works from
the Impressionists onwards.
T h e G a l l e r y also organises temporary
exhibitions, both major ones and smaller
displays. I went along this week to see two of
the small exhibitons.
Howard Hodgkin's Indian Leaves
These were made by Howard Hodgkin whilst
he was staying in Ahmedabad in November
1978. Every day he received leaves of specially
handmade paper, still wet from the factory, on
which he painted before they dried. The paints
used were the traditional vegetable dyes used
to coloukr Indian textiles: he asked for a
Mughal red, Indian ochre, as many different
greens as possible and so on. His 'Indian
Leaves' have a tropical richness and intensity
of colour that convey most vividly the hot,
steamy-jungle atmosphere and the dust and
brightness of smarkets and fruits.
Each image is painted in two versions: they

The play is all the more remarkable in that it
was written in 1835 when the author was a
mere t w e n t y - o n e - y e a r s - o l d . B u c h n e r is
perhaps more famous for his Woyzeck, but
Danton's Death shows not traces of its being
hastily written, composed as it was under great
pressure in less than five weeks (while he was
under close police surveillance for his political
activities).
Many of the cast have come straight from
the production of The Prince of Homburg by
von Kleist at the Cottesloe Theatre. Buchner
and von Kleist show remarkable similarities;
both had a scientific training, both wrote their
works when they were very young, and both
their style sare analytic and objective but
intensely dramatic. For those of you who ahve
seen The Prince (it is now finished), Danton's
Death makes an interesting comparison.

are hung as pairs. Variations are due to the
state of drying of the paper and the fact that
paper dried so rapidly in the heat of India,
decisions about composition and colouring
had to be taken almost instantly and there was
no time for reinterpretation between the two
versions. Another effect of working with wet
paper is that the dyes actually penetrate the
paper. They do not all mix equally well, giving
outlines either sharp or fuzzy and a surface
finish which shines like lacquer or is softly
matt. It's a fascinating process and the end
product is most evocative in India.
Prints in Gallery 61
The fifty-five prints and works on paper
showing in Gallery 61 were mostly acquired by
the Tate in the last two years.
T h e w o r d ' p r i n t ' is a m u d d l i n g one
embracing anything from the pattern on a
piece of cloth, to the cheap copy of a Van
Gogh painting. In this context it applies to the
graphic processes of lithography, relief-,
intaglio-, and screen-printing. Rather than
painting directly on canvas or paper, the artist
first makes a 'tool' and then uses it to produce
an 'edition' of identical impressions.
Seventeen different artists are represented,
and as many different approaches to 'art'.
What is the most minimal visual information
House of Wax
Certificate AA, starring Vincent Price,
Phyllis Kirk, now showing exclusively at
ABC Fulham Road.
Following the unexpected success of Comin
at Ya (a rather poor Western) in America,
there has been a recent revival in 3-D films.
Not only are Jaws 3 and possibly Halloween 3
being filmed in the process, but also Friday the
13th, part 3 which has already opened in
America.
O n the tail of the surge Warners have wisely
decided to revive the earliest and perhaps best
k n o w n 3-D film House of Wax ( w h i c h
catapulted Vincent Price to stardom in 1953).
Filmed in 'Natural Vision' and 'WarnerColor' it
is a beautiful and strangely atmospheric horror
film, which contains a few genuine shocks and
uses the process fairly effectively.
Vincent Price (in a part he has constantly
reprised during his career) plays Henry Jarrod,
a brilliant wax sculptor who idolises his artistic
creations and resists his partner's attempts to
start a C h a m b e r of H o r r o r s . W h e n said
p a r t n e r b u r n s d o w n their u n s u c c e s s f u l

and is presumed to be dead. The scene is set
A sample from Further Down on Maggie's
Farm by Steve Bell (Penguin £2.95). These two
frames are from the Adventures of Lord G o d
Almighty, who joins Steve's other victims (the

in another of his very funny cartoon books.
necessary to define a work of art? This is the
question answered by Sol LeWitt's 'Lines in
Four Directions' and by the series of distorted
squares within circles of Robert Mangold: his is
a fascinating experiment in seeing versus
perceiving.
O t h e r w o r k s c o n c e r n not p e r c e p t u a l
abstraction but images grown from figures and
identifiable objects. Eduardo Paolozz'i's Heads
are delimited by struts and scaffolding. Their
internal workings are those of robots or space
stations and bear no relation to a dissection
class.
And some works are just plain witty. In
'Farm Animals', Marcel Broodthaers has given
county-show-specimens of cattle the names of
B M W , M e r c e d e s , etc! A tongue-in-cheek
manipulation of the literal meaning we attach
to brand images created in glossy ads.
This little exhibition will appeal to anyone
with a visual sense of humour.
Where, when £?
Both exhibitions are at the Tate Gallery,
Millbank, open Mon-Sat 10:00am-5:50pm, Sun
2:00-5:50pm. Howard Hodgkin's Indian Leaves
