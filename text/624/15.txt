Debsoc
Comes Out
The newly reconstituted Debat-
ing Society held its first event for
f o u r years o n M o n d a y . T h e
motion 'This House believes that
Multilateralists live in a D r e a m
W o r l d ' , proposed by Michael
N o r m a n and seconded by L a
Iatrou, was defeated by N i c k
Sketch, who was seconded by
Stephen Curry.
W i t h the Dossible exception of
Miss Iatrou, of all the speakers
h a d o b v i o u s l y h a d p r e v i o u s
d e b a t i n g e x p e r i e n c e . M o s t
impressive was M r Curry, whose
technique and use of charming
metaphors complemented M r
Sketch's solid arguments. In the
voting at the end, the opposition
received three times as many
votes as the proposers.
M e m b e r s h i p of the society
now stands at over fifty, most of
whom are expected to speak at
l e a s t o n c e e v e r y y e a r ; the

avoid regular speakers. Future

PINOCCHIO
• mmmmammmmmammmm
in order to make some money and relieve the
burden on the hard-pressed taxpayer, British
Rail intend to operate some special excursions
on the scenic route between the resorts of
Higher P a y r i s e and K i H i n b u c k t o n . Killin-
buckton is a terminus (the last resort?), and
the train will have to be turned around. The
train is to comprise the steam locomotive 'the
Flying Picket', one second class car, one
restaurant car, and a Pullman observation car,
with windows in the rear.
The layout of track at Killinbuckton is in the
form of a triangle, as shown. The figures
indicate how many vehicles will fit in each
section of track.
The problem, then, is this:
1. The train arrives from Higher Payrise in
the order: locomotive, second class coach,
restaurant car, Pullman car; it must leave in
the same order, but facing in the opposite
direction.
2. The locomotive and the Pullman car
must have been turned around when they
leave, the restaurant car and the second class
coach need not be.
3. Killinbuckton is entirely flat, hence no
rolling of vehicles is allowed.
4. Nothing can move without being coupled
to the locomotive.
5. Everything must be at a standstill for
coupling or u n c o u p l i n g to take place (no
'pushing').
What is the minimum number of moves
required to turn the train (the first move
starts with the train standing on the line from
Higher Payrise; a move ends whenever the
locomotive has to stop for coupling, uncoupling
or a change of direction)?
Solutions, comments,criticisms to me at the
FELIX Office by Wednesday, 1:00pm. £5 from
Menda-Bike for a randomly selected entry.

Last Week's Solution
Last week's problem was rather trivial, but
for those of you who failed to obtain the
solution,
Quentin went with Mary
Richard went with Mungo
Steve went with Mandy
Tim went with Midge
Of the sixteen entries, the winner was, for
the second time, Jim Ward of C h e m Eng 1 (I
assure you I don't k n o w him!), who can
collect his prize on Monday (after 1:30pm
please).
General Reisenschein
All right, I'm sorry, in the second statement
of General Reisenschein's problem I did use
the word 'congruent'. What I meant was, the
same size and shape, and I was just saving
space, and unfortunately, making a mistake at
the same time. Also, I shall admit that the
dissection is not terribly convenient for offices,
consisting as it does, of two rooms, but here
you are, the moment you've all been waiting
for.
General Reisenschein's Offices
O n the second try, nineteen people solved
the problem, and the winner(s) chosen at
r a n d o m was G a r y S m i t h , C i v E n g 3, in
collaboration with Susan Griffiths, and Gary
can pick up the cheque on Monday from the
FELIX Office.
Banana's Revenge
Congratulations to anyone who managed to
solve this problem. A solution, and, I suspect,
the unique solution, is
1. P-K4 N-KB3
2. P-KB3 N x P
3. Q-K2 N-N6
4. Q x P c h Q x Q c h
5. K-B2 N x R mate
If you want to advertise any event by use of
a puzzle in this column, then drop me a note,
saying what prize you're going to donate (eg
the orchestra will be giving away two tickets
for their concert), and what you'd like the
puzzle to be about. About three weeks notice
(or more!) would be appreciated, but 1 must
know at least a fortnight before the event. If
you wish to take advantage of this special offer
(before it runs out!) drop a line to me in the
Pinocchio box in the FELIX Office.
