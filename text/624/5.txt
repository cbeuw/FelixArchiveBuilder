News Reporting
I've moaned about this before
(as have editors since F E L I X
was conceived) but so much
criticism is flying at the moment
that I'd like to straighten out a
few points, particularly in view
of the letter from Adrian James,
my news editor, which is printed
opposite.
News editing is probably the
most difficult job on the staff of
F E L I X . T o stop the news
sounding stale, almost all the
research and all the writing has
to be done on W e d n e s d a y
afternoon (when undergraduates
are next to impossible to con-
tact), and then the sub-editing,
typesetting, pasting-up and
printing are all done in one mad
rush on Thursday.
Secondly, people often exag-
gerate the facts (you should have
heard the R C S U version of the
mascotry raid and compared it
with Guilds'; I scarcely believed
they were telling me about the
same event!) or tell deliberate
untruths. We do try our best to
present the facts as they happen,
but the news editor is less than
omnipresent and we have to rely
on oral reports from members of
College who (and here's the rub)
are p r e p a r e d to p h o n e the
F E L I X Office and tell us the
news.
Thirdly, an enormous amount
of news is 'of a sensitive nature'.
In five issues of F E L I X so far
produced, including two post-
graduate issues, there have been
f o u r s t o r i e s w h i c h I have
withheld at the request of the
various people involved, and a
further one which perhaps I
would have withheld had I
EDITORIAL
received enough information in
time. But it isn't possible even to
seek out all the people who
know the facts about a story, let
alone find all those likely to
know some reason why it should
not be printed; and, apart from
this, people must take responsi-
bility for their decisions and
actions, and if they do or say
something in public which they
later regret, am I to be blamed
for reporting it in a way which
brings out the features of their
actions which have mass appeal?
The news pages are supposed to
be interesting; after all.
Do I need to spell out the
conclusion of this outburst? We
need more news staff. Anyone
who has any aspirations at all in
this direction, be it interviewing,
researching, writing or whatever,
should come and find either me
or Adrian in the F E L I X Office,
preferably on Fridays or M o n -
days to introduce yourself, or on
Wednesday afternoons to work.
Also, we need news. If anything
of interest, however" slight,
happens in y o u r l a b , y o u r
lectures, your committee, your
C C U or whatever, we need to
hear about it. And finally, the
responsibility for what I publish
rests with me. The responsibility
for your words and deeds,
reported accurately in F E L I X ,
rests with you.
FELIX Staff
New reporting aside, we are still
very short-staffed on F E L I X ,
and will welcome anyone who is
prepared to give up some time,
however irregularly, to help
produce this newspaper. N o
previous experience is necessary
(in the case of collating it's not
even desirable) as we will teach
' you all the various skills involv-
ed in graphics work, layout,
design, or whatever turns you
on, as they say. We particularly,
u r g e n t l y , desperately need
people to help on Thursdays
between 2:30 and 5:30pm when
the paper is finally put to bed,
but most of the regular staff
have lectures, practicals, and so
forth. If anyone is even remotely
interested, come to the F E L I X
Office anytime today or early
next week and introduce your-
self.
We also need c o l l a t o r s .
Collating consists of slipping the
folded sheets of F E L I X inside
one another and needs no skill
w h a t s o e v e r ( e v e n S t e p h e n
Goulder has been known to
help.) Just turn up on Thursday
evening and join in the convivial
social atmosphere, and help the
other staff members calm the
Editor as the folding machine
breaks down yet again. Collating
usually starts at around 7:30pm
and goes on late, but come for as
much or as little as you like.
U G M
Although you might not have
guessed it from the appalling
lack of publicity, there is an
important Union General Meet-
ing next Tuesday at 1:00pm in
the Great Hall. At this meeting,
the v a r i o u s c a n d i d a t e s for
Deputy President of the Union
will make their hustings speech-
es, so come along and find out
who you want to administer
your finances next year.
IF and R C M
If anyone from the Institut
Franpais or the Xoyal College of
Music would like to act as a
semi-official representative of
their respective college on the
staff of F E L I X (even if all they
do is collect a bundle of copies
every Friday,) would they please
get in touch.

M A R Y F R E E M A N may be one
of the most hardworking Honor-
ary Secretaries the Union has
seen in recent years, but she is
not, it has to be said, one of the
most wildly popular. Whether it
is her insistence on sticking to
every minutest tittle of the
statute book (not in itself a bad
thing) or the curious stony-faced
expression she wears as she
quotes verbatim long extracts
from Union regulations Idon't
know, but nevertheless she is
becoming rather disliked by
several members of the Union,
and it was a close-run thing
when she was ill last week and
Council agreed to send her a Get
Well Soon card by fourteen
votes to twelve with three
abstentions.
One of the Honorary Secre-
tary's jobs is the allocation of
parking permits, and it was
brought to my attention that
some malicious wit had sub-
mitted an application in the
name of a fictitious student;
furthermore, this student had
been deemed worthy of a much-
coveted permit. After a little
research I managed to track
down the application in quest-
ion, and feel it is worth reprod-
ucing in full:
T am devout muslim and I have
come to college because there is
mosque on the College premises.
As for this I have to stay in
College in evening to pray before
I go away to home. So I have to
bring my prayer carpet into
College and it cannot go on the

train I am told this is so. My
uncle P a t r i c k who lives in
Manchester pays for me and I do
not get money to travel publicly.
There is no money out of Iran
which I can lay my handes on.
But the most important reason I
think is that I have a chronic
sufferer. I have a disease called
Bilharzia which attacks. So I
have to get to College quickly. I
was lucky to get from Tehran
and if I cannot stay at College I
may be sent home so I pray to
the holy Imam and Allah my
Light and Savioiur that you will
grant this simple wish. May the
holy Allah be blessing you with
many children.'
F U N N Y H O W the practical
jokers, the rumour-spreaders,
the gossip columnists of this
world find it so difficult to
swallow a taste of their own
medicine. In last week's column
22,1982
I r e l a t e d several less than
complimentary tales concerning
ex-Editor Steve Marshall. This
week I found him supposedly
working in the F E L I X Office on
his own. Being naturally curious,
and wondering what had in-
duced him to lend his talents so
generously, I took a look at the
page he was working on, and
discovered, to no great surprise,
that he had been switching
round the signatures on the
Letters to the Editor.
IT H A S almost become tradit-
ional to criticise Victor Mooney
in this newspaper; how refresh-
ing,' then, that his first mention
in this column is to commend
him for his humility last Satur-
day when, in the absence of three
of his staff, he tied an apron
round his ample girth and spent
most of the afternoon washing
up.
