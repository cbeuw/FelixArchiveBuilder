I C vs U C L 7-0
A rainy day. but a promising
start for the first eleven in their
first game of the season. With
four new players in the side,
Imperial began the game eager
to show the form that has won
us the College league for the past
few years.
A f t e r a t e n t a t i v e s t a r t , I C
s t a r t e d s t r i n g i n g s o m e g o o d
passes together creating good
will on the field and covering
back well. This possession was
soon converted to a well-taken
goal by Garme-. and by half-time
the score was 3-0 U C L were
denied several chances in the
first half by a good first per-
formance by Tony Atkins who
was substituted to allow another
sweeper A n d y Stuart to play his
first game for Imperial.
T h e s e c o n d half f o u n d I C

I C vs Amersham 1-1
The stench of the still unwashed
first t e a m s h i r t s c i r c u l a t e d
around the worried laces of the
second team. W h o would go in
goal if Skitter did not appear?
Eldridge was the reply, at least
the mask would keep him quiet.
But then a flash of light and the
goalie entered stage right. So out
into the wind and rain went the
brave bunch and found them-
selves immediately dominated
by an A m e r s h a m t e a m w h o
rewarded any skill on the part of
IC with a tactless stick in the
legs. The team battled hard with
Slatter playing a blinder in goal.
( F o r once commented an unkind
voice). Unfortunately though we
were unable to stop the opposi-
tion grabbing a short corner
goal.
A tactical rearrangement at
half-time and also deciding to
drop to the opposition's level
produced a gritty and a mighty
physical performance. The I C
f o r w a r d s n o w r e m e m b e r i n g
where the goal was actually put
some shots in that direction and
somehow D u b l o n s k i managed
to slot in an equaliser through a
forest of players.
So another good result for the
seconds mainly due to inspired
leadership (?) and a faultless
C u n n i n g h a m performance, but
then again Sweeper is such an
easy position to play!

In order to encourage a fast,
open game, IC 3rd X I chose to
play with only eight men on
S a t u r d a y . T h i s brave t a c t i c a l
gamble narrowly failed to pay
o f f d e s p i t e a s p i r i t e d p e r -
formance from all concerned.
F i n e defensive w o r k f r o m
Bailey and M o d l e y and a penalty
flick save from Hepper kept IC
in the game early on and gave
rise to numerous spirited charges
down the field from W a r d , Jones
and acting captain Purdy. Close
to the opposition goal, however,
IC found it difficult to break
down a tight defence, although
Salter came close to scoring on
several occasions.
I C s positive approach led (on
occasion) to a lack of cover in
defence and O C ' s look advantage
of the opportunity to score four
times during the game. The fine
spirit in which the match was
p l a y e d was g r a p h i c a l l y i l l u s -
trated when a mis-hit shot from
Lyons was generously helped
into the goal by an opposition
defender—thus ensuring a well
deserved consolation for IC at
the end of a strenuous afternoon.

IC vs St Thomas's 12-10
The match against St T h o m a s '

minutes. 0-10. The IC forwards
now started to play, and the
front five were pushing their
o p p o n e n t s a l l over the p a r t .
Thus, at half-time I C were still
only 10-0 down.
In the second half the forwards
continued their dominance, and
IC spent the majority of the time
in St T h o m a s ' 25. T h i s was
rewarded with a try under the
post by W K i n g , after a for-

on many occasions they could
not get the last score. However,
in the last seconds of the match
IC were given another penalty in
front of the posts. H M c D o w a l l
converted this, and IC won 12-

Wednesday October 13 saw IC

with their annual round L o n d o n
mystery tour. First stop on this
epic journey (organised by W

pleasant little suburb at the end
of the Northern Line, apparently
lacking in both pubs and rugby
teams. After a quick spin of the
compass (and a few phone calls)
it was back up the northern line
and off to R i c h m o n d . At this
point there were several remarks
to the tune o f ' O r a n g e Tree' and

casual 'get pissed".

I C vs Kings' 4-1
The 3rd X I ' s first league game
of the season, against K i n g s ' 2nd
X I at H a r l i n g t o n . did not begin
as we had hoped and by half-
time we were 1-0 d o w n . However
with increased organisation and
effort in the second half we got
back into the game. G o a l s by
J o h n Healy and Torsen Behling
put us into the lead, before the
highlight of the game: a powerful
t o e - p o k e f r o m J o h n , f i r e d
straight at the goalkeeper, which
was somehow fumbled over the
line. A n o t h e r close range shot in
the last few minutes sealed our
first win of the season.
