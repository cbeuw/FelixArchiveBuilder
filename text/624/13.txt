Offbeat Classics
Fancy an enjoyable day hearing various forms of 'classical'
music conducted by half-wits, blown on hosepipes and
generally mangled to pieces? If so it's time to raid the current
account and turn up at the Royal College of Music (the red-
brick building between Aero and Mines) sometime after
10:00am on Saturday for Musithon, the highlight of the RCM
Centenary year. For the princely sum of fifty pence you get
admission to the building where you will be greeted by the
sounds of buskers, pipers and a computer. For the main
attractions of the day you will have to dig a little deeper into
your pockets, and you will then be, able to assail your ears
with 'Ten Harps, Ten Cellos, Ten Green Bottles' (RCM
olavinn around again?), 'Taling about Musithon', Musicmagic,
a concert by Peter Skellern, Musithon Cabaret and a concert
of Dixieland jazz.
'Talking about Musithon' features Antony Hopkins, one of
Radio Three's most popular music critics, talking about
Tchaikovsky's Fourth Symphony as never before.
'Conduct it Yourself allows absolutely anyone to try to
conduct the RCM orchestra or just to turn up and suffer as
others are conducting.
'Musithon Cabaret' is the event of the evening, Sir David
Willcocks hosts a multitude of stars from the musical world,
including Julian Lloyd-Webber, Jennifer Partridge, the Light
Blues, Raimund Herincx, Peggy Spencer, Tim Brooke-
Taylor (?) and many more.
Whether you want to just turn up and browse around the
RCM, or go to as many concerts as possible pick up a leaflet
with more details from the RCM foyer as soon as possible..
