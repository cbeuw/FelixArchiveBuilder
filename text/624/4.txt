News Reporting
Dear Martin
Officials from several societies
have complained recently that
c e r t a i n n e w s a r t i c l e s h a v e
included too little/too m u c h /
i n c o r r e c t / t o o e m b a r r a s i n g l y
correct information about their
activities, while they have taken
no measures to supply F E L I X
with information. Whereas I can
s o m e t i m e s c o n t a c t s o c i e t y
o f f i c i a l s w h o h a v e i n t e r n a l
t e l e p h o n e s , f i n d i n g u n d e r -
graduates on a Thursday after-
noon when there are six other
news stories to write up is just
not possible.
C o n t r a r y to p o p u l a r belief
and established precedent, we do
try to print news as accurately as
possible. In the case of the W I S T
article of a fortnight ago, my
i n f o r m a t i o n was s u p p l i e d by
W e l l s o c (a v e r y p u b l i c i t y -
c o n s c i o u s o r g a n i s a t i o n ) a n d
f r o m that b o t t o m l e s s pit (of
information) the U n i o n Office,
in the absence of any attempt by
M e s d e m o i s e l l e s N a h o n a n d
Watts to contact me.
Henceforth, any complaints
f r o m s o c i e t i e s w h i c h h a v e
performed some vaguely news-
worthy feat and made no attempt
to supply us with information
w i l l be s t u d i o u s l y i g n o r e d .
A n y o n e who believes that it is a
reporter's function to seek out
information should apply to the
F E L I X O f f i c e f o r the j o b
(people who have had to look up
more than three words in this
letter need not apply). Until I
have a news staff of more than
two people (will they breed in
captivity?) you will have to put
up with what 1 write.

Dear Sir
We have reason to complain
of the R C S U lackeys and minions
who organised the Chemistry
Freshers' Dinner on Tuesday
October 19.
I, a n d three f r i e n d s , were
holding a conversation in an
isolated part of the J C R — a w a y
from the 'action'—when we were
a p p r o a c h e d by M r C h a r l e s
Fuller, R C S H o n Sec, and told,
n a y o r d e r e d , t o l e a v e t h e
premises. O n our reluctance to
comply—due to our rights to
remain in the J C R under U n i o n
rules—Chas brought over his
'heavies' and threatened us with
violence, telling us lo ' F u c k O f f
and if we did not leave we would
be f o r c i b l y ejected f r o m the
room.
We began to leave peacefully
but harassment continued and
my three colleagues a c t u a l l y
pushed through the doors.
We believe that this behaviour
was unjustified and offensive.
E v e n one of the ' b o u n c e r s '
admitted that we had the right to
be there but he wanted a pint so
we had to get out.
We demand a printed apology
and a commitment that this will
never happen to us or any other
students again.
Yours sincerely

Glass-handed
Dear Sir
O K I let M a r k Smith get away
with it once but now he has
repeated his error. The classic
Outer Limits episode ' F i e n d with
a Glass H a n d ' by Ray Bradbury
does not exist. The classic Outer
Limits episode ' D e m o n with a
Glass H a n d ' by Harlan Ellison
does. This was the episode about
an android, Trent, who had to
save the entire h u m a n race,
stored on a bit of fuse-wire in his
hand, from a marauding gang of
third rate actors wearing black
balaclava helmets. It is a classic
because it is the only episode not
featuring an alien with a head
like a melon.
I always preferred The Twilight
Zone series.

Phil Nathan—
the true facts
revealed
Dear Martin
With reference to your editor-
ial in last week's F E L I X con-
demning my so-called 'hypo-
crisy', here are a few facts which
I feel 'deserve a wider audience'.
1. T h e ' w o n d e r f u l ' l e t t e r
which you quote from the R C S U
Broadsheet as written by Debbie
Cooper, was, so 1 have been
informed, not actually written
by her, nor did she know that
any such article was going to be
i n c l u d e d i n B r o a d s h e e t . It
appears that the letter was a
fabrication—a forgery.
2. The contents of the letter
are simply not true, ie they are
either lies or the result of some
immense mistake on the au' hor's
part. I in no way encouaged Ms
Debbie Cooper to dress up in
" n o t h i n g but a sweatshirt and
underwear". I was not present
when it took place and did not
Phil Nathan:
Sexist stocking filler?
find out that this had happened
until alter the event.
Following your 'strong con-
demnation' of my hypocrisy and
y o u r a t t i t u d e t o w a r d s the
motion on the Jez Queen at the
R C S Freshers' U G M . I realise
how much the above will dis-
appoint you; but there you go.
T h e r e can be no excuse for
p r i n t i n g l i b e l l o u s statements
however reliable the source, and
a little bit more care will earn
F E L I X much greater respect.
Yours 'hippo'-critically

Dear Sir
Phil Nathan is not a hypocrite
as you claim in your editorial.
Deb Cooper did not write a letter
in B r o a d s h e e t c l a i m i n g P h i l
e n c o u r a g e d her to a d v e r t i s e
sweatshirts by parading herself
in nothing but a sweatshirt and
underwear, someone else did.
The truth is that I and Debbie
b o t h d e c i d e d to m o d e l the
sweatshirts (we both paraded in
s w e a t s h i r t s a n d ' u n d e r w e a r ' )
and we didn't tell Phil till later.
Y o u r editorial has unwittingly
played into the hands of those in
R C S who would discredit Phil
Nathan and his (and others in
L i f e S c i ' a t t e m p t to c h a n g e
R C S U to a form more desirable
to its members, and the crude
and dirty tactics they employ.
P h i l N a t h a n r e m a i n s a most
respected ex-Life Sci Dep Rep
amongst Life Scientists if not the
rest of the College, many of us
find his attempts to change R C S
from within laudable and sincere
if perhaps in vain.

Since I had checked the
facts with Debbie before I
wrote the Editorial, I felt
it only fair to allow her
the right of reply -Ed.
Dear Martin
H a v i n g read the letters for
F E L I X this week I would like to
comment further on one or two
points:
1. The letter in Broadsheet
though not personally penned
was written under my instruction
and on info received from me. I
certainly had knowledge of its
inclusion in Broadsheet before
Broadsheet was produced.
2. I r e p e a t t h a t P h i l h a d
knowledge of this 'modelling' of
L i f e S c i T - s h i r t s b e f o r e it
occured (though the idea was
p r i n c i p a l l y G e o f f s ) a n d P h i l
suggested we might like to repeat
the performance for Life Sci 2!
Therefore, apparently condoned
the idea.
3. P r i n c i p a l l y this was not
intended as a personal dig at
P h i l ' s p o l i t i c s , m e r e l y h i s
irresponsible attitude by putting
forward such a motion at the
Freshers' U G M .
