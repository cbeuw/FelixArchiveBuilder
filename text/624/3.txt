A Grand Wink
The long-awaited Tiddlywinks
Rag Stunt on Saturday was a
great success, raising £980 for
charity. None of the expected
problems from police or Chelsea
College arose.
Nearly a hundred and fifty
students from the three C o n -
stituent College U n i o n s started
from The Vale and t i d d l y w i n k e d
u p K i n g ' s R o a d t o S l o a n e
Square. This represented a break
from tradition, as until this year
t i d d l y w i n k i n g has always taken
place along O x f o r d Street, but
after warnings from police and
s o m e t r o u b l e o v e r c o l l e c t i n g
licences the event was twice put
off and a new venue found.
I n k e e p i n g w i t h t r a d i t i o n ,
however, the contingent from
t h e R o y a l S c h o o l o f M i n e s

mindedly d o w n the middle of the
road, while the more cautious
members of C & G and R C S used
the pavements. The route took

regarded by their students as an
infringement on their territory;
but there was no visible reaction
f r o m w i t h i n . F u r t h e r m o r e ,
police presence'was limited to a
discreet inspector, two sergeants
and three constables who raised
no legal objections until Sloane
S q u a r e was r e a c h e d . A t this
point the students were asked
n o t to p r o p e l t h e i r c o u n t e r s
across the pedestrian crossings,
as they had already caused a
certain a m o u n t of traffic c o n -
gestion.
The event drew to a close with

Because the money was de-
livered direct to M E N C A P on
the same day, individual totals
f o r the three C C U s are not
available.
Insecurity
F o u r bicycles, with a n estimated
total value of £600, were stolen
from the College on Wednesday:
two from i n front of the Science
M u s e u m L i b r a r y , one from in
front of M e c h E n g a n d one f r o m
b e h i n d the M i n e s B u i l d i n g s -
were all fastened with light chain
or cables which were cut with a

seems l i k e l y t h a t t h e t h i e v e s
carried out a t h o r o u g h recon-
naissance of the College before
selecting suitable targets.
N o n e of the machines h a d
been registered w i t h security; all
students with bicycles who have
not yet done so are asked to go
to the security officer o n level
one of the Sherfield B u i l d i n g
with details of the frame n u m b e r ,
make and colour of their bicycle.
