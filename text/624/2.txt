Mines & Ents
Dear Sir
On reading F E L I X on Friday
I was astounded to discover a
letter concerning the Mines lack
of involvement in F r e s h e r s '
Week—this being the first I'd
heard of it. Now the idea of
Freshers' Week was, that for the
first time, there would be a co-
ordinated set of activities and
entertainments in the first week
involving all three C C U s , I C U
and IC Ents. A meeting to
arrange details was held in mid-
June last term at which the
relevant Mines Ents Officer,
John McPherson, was present
along with the other C C U Ents
Officers, the I C U Exec and
myself a n d other interested
p a r t i e s . T h e result o f this
meeting was that Ents would be
responsible for booking two gigs
and a film double bill with other
people w o r k i n g as a g r e e d .
U n f o r t u n a t e l y , the p e r s o n
responsible f o r the s m o o t h -
running of this event was Phil
Greenstreet, so whilst I was at
home, happily booking bands
with Phil's failure there was no-
one to look after the other
details and chaos was unleashed.
Meanwhile I C U Exec began to
assume that Freshers' Week was
solely an Ents function, as I
suppose did the C C U s and in
particular Mines. The events
organised by Guilds and R C S in
Freshers' Week showed at least
that they were aware of the
concept but unfortunately Mines
arranged a week of Freshers'
events. I can't blame my old
mate John Eagleson, I suppose,
but as Mines V P he ought to
have known where to go tiddly-
winking this weekend without
relying on me to tell him.

Dear Martin
As Publicity Officer for the
H G Wells Society, I feel bound
to reply to the letter from the
WIST Officers published in last
week's F E L I X .
In many ways I agree with
what they had to say, and I
accept that some people may
have found the poster offensive.
The reason for using the poster
in q u e s t i o n was to attract
people's attention, make them
read the poster and make them
come along to Freshers' Fair. In
these respects it has been a
resounding success.
I believe, however, that the
students of Imperial College do
not wish to pass a U G M motion
which would effectively censor
College posters. It is gross to
suggest, as do the ladies o f
WIST, that a publicity officer
should not use pictures which
are "totally irrelevant to their
society in order to advertise its
existence".
In c o n c l u s i o n , Wellsoc is
indeed the society where every-
one's face fits, no matter what
their interests, creed or colour or
political allegiance. I can see
nothing in any poster that I have
produced that contradicts this
admirable ideal.

Dear Martin
So the Wellsoc poster was
offensive to WIST et al. It was
meant to be publicity and to
stand out amongst the junk that
most societies adorned College
with over Freshers' Week. What
with U G M motions and F E L I X
articles Wellsoc seems to have
obtained more attention than
could ever have been hoped for,
with the added bonus that WIST
have taken a free trip on our
publicity bandwagon.
I should like to point out that
Wellsoc used a poster with a pair
of bare breasts last year to
advertise a lecture on vampires.
There were no U G M motions on
that one—perhaps it was thought
more artistic than the last! Given
this sort of ambiguity in reaction
how is a motion calling for
almost random, public censor-
ship going to solve any problems?
We will probably have running
continued on page 4.
