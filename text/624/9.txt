Major Sub-Committees
Athletics Clubs Committee
(ACC) is concerned with the
administration of the sports
clubs, dealing with individual
club's monetary allocations and
forming a source of positive
feedback on the sports needs
within College.
Social Clubs Committee (SCC)
has a similar function to A C C ,
dealing mostly with religious
and political societies, although
it encompasses other societies
which are 'social' rather than
'active' in aim.
Recreational Clubs Committee
(RCC) is again a similar idea,
although dealing mostly with
'games and hobbies' clubs. Often
the distinction between S C C and
R C C clubs is difficult to see!
Overseas Students Committee
(OSC) is not only concerned
with the running of the overseas
students' societies, but also
provides a platform for making
the views of the Union known
about such matters as overseas
students fees, etc.
Social, Cultural and Amuse-
ments Board (SCAB) deals with
anything that .could come under
the heading of 'performing arts'.
It continas the Music Society
which is an umbrella for the
Orchestra and the Choir.
P u b l i c a t i o n s B o a r d (Pub
B o a r d ) is perhaps slightly
misnamed, since it is concerned
with not just publications, but
with all the student media,
including IC Radio and STOIC
as well as the publications side
(FELIX, The Phoenix, etc). It
should, of course, provide a
regulatory influence on publica-
tions, but there seems precious
little evidence of this!
Silwood Park Committee. Sil-
wood Park is the College's field
station near Ascot, and this
committee is intended to repre-
sent the views of the students
there to the bulk of the students
at Imperial, as well as covering
just about all the functions of the
Union at the Silwood Park Site.
Other Subcommittees
Academic Affairs tries to
attain/maintain a high standard
of lecturing and practical work
throughout the departments at
College, as well as providing a
campaign platform for opposi-
tion to cuts, etc.
Welfare is concerned with
provisions within College of
'welfare f a c i l i t i e s ' : H e a l t h
Centre, Student Services, etc.
Postgraduate Affairs forms the
basis for social interaction of
postgraduates (eg P G Plough-,
Page 10 I H B I H B f f i H B f f l H H B
man's Lunches) and a forum for
the discussion of problems
which refer explicitly to P G s â€”
timing of PhDs, grants, etc.
External Affairs deals with the
interaction between the Union
and outside bodies, principally
U L U and other London colleges,
the N U S (yes, we do still talk to
them sometimes) and so on.
Entertainments Committee
(Ents) is responsible for catering
for the entertainment of Joe
student. Less of a committee and
more of a clique, and to some
extent if your likes and theirs
don't coincide, then tough!
Rag Committee co-ordinates
the activities of C C U Rag as well
as deciding on the charities for
the year and (occasionally)
organising stunts. It is res-
ponsible for the paperwork:
p r o d u c i n g accounts, getting
. l i c e n c e s , etc, which it has
miserably failed to do in the past
few years!
Permanent Working Party
(PWP) is a kind of a Union
think-tank. The six (or less)
members get together and
brainstorm the boring things no-
one else can be bothered to
discuss. May be mandated (or
sometimes chose of its own
accord to stick its nose into
anything that happens at College
(or outside), and to deliver its
considered opinion to Council.
Other Important Independent
Union Committees
House Committee allocates
money to be spent to make the
Union less of a tip. It is res-
ponsible for such monstrosities
as the Union Lower Lounge
partition (an ill-fated monolith
of less than a year's duration),
the new Union Lower Lounge
and so on. Considering how
much money they spend, it's
amazing that there's never any
difference!
Internal Services deals with
things like Southside Shop,
Bookshop, Games Machines,
Haldane Library, Refectories,
etc. Rarely quorate and a real
pain at times this committee has
the potential to really get things
done. A pity really!
Transport Committee deals
with the failing health of the four
U n i o n vans and perpetually
moans that we can't afford new
ones. Suffers particularly from
the recession!
Safety Committee Notable by its
absence. Under the Health and
Safety at Work Act, the Union
has a legal obligation to have
one of these. Ooops, what a slip!
Other Committees
You may hear about such other
committees as Bar Committee,
Refectories Committee. Student
Residence Committee, and so
on. These are all part of College
administration and, although
the Union has representatives on
all of these, they are not directly
under Union control.
Departmental Representatives
Not the most keen and active
members of Union Council. Dep
Reps have few responsibilities
outside their CCUs. There is at
present a move underway to
remove them from Council.
So that's it. If you wish to
complain, you now know how, or
at least to whom it should be
done. I hope this has made the
mechanics of the Union a little
more understandable, and that
you might now choose to play a
part!

Percival Sydney, cool sedate
Poet presumptive, tool of fate,
Seeking as ever, ideas new,
Decided to stroll through a nearby zoo.
Laurie the lion, resting, still,
Dreaming of days of chase and kill,
Just one more rend, just one more splurge,
Savage, relentless, ancient urge.
A careless keeper, an opening prised,
And two ambitions were realised,
For Percival Sydney, cool sedate
Became the Poet Laurie-ate.
Geoffrey Reeves
The poem above was published in last year's edition of
The Phoenix, the magazine of IC Union.
