Some ciubtt to join
D E B A T I N G SOCIETY —
It gives me great pleasure to welcome you
to the Debatingl Society: as a member of
I.C. Union you are also a member of the
I.C. Debating Society.
The Society meets on Thursdays at fort-
nightly intervals, and debates miotions rang-
ing from political and religious to comic. The
Society also takes part in competitive debat-
ing, entering the U . L . U Debating .Tourna-
ment, which it won three years ago. Last year
the Society inaugurated a very successful inter-
College Debating Competition, which was won
by C. & G., who will be doing their best to
retain the magnificent trophy; this looks rather
like the F . A . Cup which was stolen a few
months ag|o. It was presented by the Royal
School of Mines.
Another innovation last year was the Society
dinner. This was a very enjoyable function,
which a high standard of after-dinner speak-
ing and it is hoped that this will become an
annual event.
We invite all Freshers who welcome the
apportunity of improving their speaking will
come to the Freshmen's Reception and let
the officials know of their existance and in-
terest. Contact Richard Lewis or George
Turner, Chairman and Secretary respectively.
We do hope you will take this opportunity
of practising your public speaking, for the
art of self-expression is of great importance
in many jobs. But even if this does not move
you, do come along on alternate Thursday
lunchtimes to be interested or amused, and
certainly never bored

Y O U should join the Motor Club whether
you have a car, a bike, or just Shanks' Pony:
here's why.
RALLIES. We have two rallies of our own
each year and through us you can enter the
rallies organised by other London colleges.
If you are more ambitious you can, as mem-
bers of our club, join the University motor
Club (U.H.UL.M.C.) at specially reduced
rates and enter tougher event.
TALKS. Among our speakers last year were
George Brown, the world solo sidecar kilo-
metre sprint record-holder, and Raymond
Mays of B . R . M . This year we hope to offer
an even better selection.
FILMS. We do not offer Bardot, but B.S.A.'s
and Bugattis can be seen at our fiihn shows.
We try to suit all tastes — road racing rallies
and trials.
Among our other activities we have table-
top rallies for Mie potential navigator and
quizzes for the student of motoring history.
As for visits, we have been to Lotus, Jaguar,
Coventry-Qimaxj, M l G . and ithe Montague
Motor Museum in the past.
We must also introduce you to our col-
lege mascot, Boanerges. We are his guardians,
he is our pride and joy. Who is Bo? He is a
1902 James and Browne veteran car, and as
Ithe President's official carriage he attends
most Union functions. Only once in the past
decade has he failed to make 'The Run' to
Brighton. His unkeep involves much labour,
especially in maintaining the polish on his
large acreage of brasswork. Enthusiastic
helpers are rewarded by an unrivalled ex-
perience, a ride in a veteran car.
If our activities interest you come along,
with no obligation, to our first meeting this
session on October 13th at 5.15 p.m. in Room
664, E . l block.

During the next few days you will probably
be overwhelmed by requests, implorings, "

r
direct orders as the case may be. from the
organisers of the various college clubs and
societies to join their numbers. This tends
to produce confusion and even a temporary
loss of identity as the strain of imagining your-
self successively as rugby player and poet,
marxist and conservative, humanist and christ-
ian, becomes too much. Only the most con-
firmed believer in the superiority of his own
taste is likely to come out of this unscathed,
and $he alternative forms of hysteria that
occur are the JOIN T H E L O T T O H E L L

N E X T Y E A R . The first hallucination sel-
dom last more than a few weeks, never longer
than a year; the second all too frequently
continues for the full three years.
What has all this to do with the Art Club?
Well, this club offers certain advantages, the
first being the most opposite to my first para-
graph of thumping digression. It isn't really
a club, you don't pay a membership fee,
and you are entirely at liberty to come once
and never again, to drift in and out or to
come every week as the fancy takes you.
Secondly, this is an active rather than a passive
club, not concerned Kvith appreciation but
with doing. Too much of this College is spent
in imparting knowledge to the passive, and
by implication stupid mind. This is a chance
to do, to feel, to create for yourself. Thirdly,
painting is for enjoyment for us, not the ser-
ious pursuit of aesthetic achievement. It
doesn't matter if you have never picked up
a paint brush before in your life or if all
your drawings turn out like stick men. There
will be somebody there to help you if you
want it and nobody will laugh at you be-
cause you aren't a Rembrandt.
Why painting particularly? It's always
difficult to rationalise anything you do but
the best way of putting it is roughly this —
by photography you record a sense, by paint-
ing you feel it. In a monochromatic flat
World, colours and shapes become apparent.
After the talk the details. The Art Club
will meet every Wednesday afternoon, beginn-
ing on the the second Wednesday of term.
The meetings will provide an opportunity to
draw and to paint, under professional tuition
and with a model. The cost of each class,
which will last from 2.30 p.m. until 5.30 p.m.
will be 4/—, this covering the cost of paints,
brushes, and all other necessary materials
which will be available to everybody who
comes along. The classes will be held in Room
B.3. in the Royal College of Art. behind the
Huxley Building. (Details of how to get there
will be put on the Union notice board.) It's
also hoped to have at a later date meetings
mit coffee, social rather than intellectual, on
a Tuesday or Thursday lunchtime. If you want
any further details or if you'd just like a talk,
please get in touch with me through the Union
rack. TONY MUSGRAVE
