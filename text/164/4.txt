Our first duty must be to welcome all our
readers on their arrival at or return to the
College, and to wish them every success in
the coming session. May we also hope that
the postgraduates Boon become innuned to
the long queues of unfamiliar and all-too-
familiar faces in the refectory and the bar.
Felix itself is a little different this term and
we hope that our readers approve. The very
small type in last session's issues came in for
a good deal of criticism, and we think that
the present size is a definite improvement.
Another innovation is an article by an ex-
editor of Phoenix; we hope that those rude
people who maintain that Felix' staff are
illiterate will be able to tell the difference.
Freshmen may be a little confused over
this PhoenixvFelix business so perhaps, ex-
planations would be welcome. Phoenix was
founded by H.G. Wells many years ago and
is now a mainly literary journal appearing four
times a year, whereas Felis is a mere twelve
years old and is a fortnightly newspaper.
These two publications are indepedant and
are not subject to the censorship of the Col-
lege or the Union, though the appointment
of their editors must be approved by the Union
Executive.
Finally, and to Freshmen in particular, be-
fore succumbing to the many societies pas-
sionately urging you to join their ranks you
might consider joining the staff of these news-
paper; there is room for talent and/or enthus-
iasm in every department and no previous ex-
perience is necessary. We have vacancies for
typists, reporters and salesgirls, and in partic-
ular the Editor would like to engage the ser-
vices of a Sports Editor and someone to assist
him in setting up the pages at the printers'
on alternate Wednesday evenings. Contact the
Editor or any of the staff on our stand in the
Concert Hall at the Freshmen's Reception.
