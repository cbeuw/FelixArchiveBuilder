TALES FROM THE HOLS!
We asked students to tell us about any
activities of theirs during the summer holi-
days which they thought might interest our
readers. Here are some of their reports, col-
lected verbatim.
1. From Miss Jossie Delgado, Chem 11.
T think that some of your readers might
be interested to hear of my experiences this
last summer in the glamorous world of films.
It all beean one bright summers's day as I
was strolling through the park in my mink
bikini admiring the flowers. A man came up
to me andi told me that I had a nice figure,
for which I thanked him. Are you interested
in Art he said. Well, yes I said. Being at uni-
versity, one is naturally, isn't one. I'm glad
of that, he said since I can visualise you in
my next film, which will be very artistic. The
human body, young lady — he» was a very
friendly man and always calling me young
lady and putting his arms around me and —
the human body, young lady, is the most
beautiful creation in this world, more magni-
ficent than even the greatest painting of
Annigoni or any other famous artist, more
wonderful than even the greatest miracle of
modern science. We are going to immortalise
the human body, young lady, young lady, you
and I, though in a tasteful way. We shall cast
away shame and proclaim to the world the
beauty of the human figure unadorned. It'll
be a sensation. Since he was such a nice re-
fined man, and had such a lovely way of
talking, I accepted. Not every girl would have,
but in the cause of Art who could refuse.
And if by any chance the film in which 1
appeared, "Nudist Reverie", should be show-
ing at your local cinema, look out for me
I'm the third pair of breasts from the left, the
one tastefully holding a suitcase in front of
her middle.
2. From Ralph Dashwood. Civil HI.
...well, there we were, sitting in this Berlin
pub, sampling the local brew, when this Ger-
man bloke came up to us. He spoke English
perfectly by the way. Why more of these
foreigpers cant take the trouble to learn the
lingo. I don't know. And he asked us how
we'd like to earn a spare bit of bier money.
Well, alright we said, being low on the old
hard stuff at the time. What gives. It's brick
laying, he said. Anything for a giggle, so we
all agreed. There was this wall see, had to
be built four feet high...

3. From Gordon Smith. Phys. P.G.
I suppose I hardly qualify as a linguist,
but I was able to persuade Uncle that I' was
the man for the job. It was a question of
translation, dry you may say, but I found
it asborbing. Threw my heart and soul into
it. The idea was to provide accurate trans-
lations of foreign film titles for the purpose
of advertising) these films, while at the same
time capturing the public's interest. Perhaps,
a few examples will explain better what I
mean. I flatter myself that these few are al-
most my best.
"Septembre en Avignon" — "Lust in the
Swamps"
"Ein Kind" — Bastard"
"Raviali e spaghetti" — Blood, Sex and Pasta"
"Teresa y su hermano" — "Incest"
4.
Apology — we were to have printed here
an account by Max Engles entitled "I saw
freedom and laughter in the peace-loving
Soviets". Unfortunately, Mr. Engles has been
unavoidably detained and we were unable to
obtain his report.
5.
Apologies again — we were to have printed
here an account by Franklin D. Washington
entitled "I saw freedom and love in the liberty-
loving America.". Unfortunately business with
the Committee of UnAmerican activities has
left Mr. Washington with no time to complete
his report.
