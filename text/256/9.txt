CORR'S MOTION FAILS IN QUORATE UNION MEETING
Dermott C o r r ' s motion-that the President of ICU should be democratically elected by-
a l l members of I C U - f a i l e d t o achieve the necessary 2/3 majority by 3 votes a f t e r a paper
b a l l o t at yesterday's Union meeting.
Proposing the motion, Corr pointed out that e l e c t i o n by the Union f l o o r would lead
t o greater student p a r t i c i p a t i o n i n the Union, and would mean the President was b e t t e r
known. Opposing, C h r i s O'Donnell based h i s arguments on the assumption that students
were not to be trusted with such an important matter, and that i t was b e t t e r l e f t to
those who knew-to whit, j o i n t c o u n c i l . Several good speeches followed, producing among
them an expose of the petty p o l i t i c k i n g and lobbying of the present system, and - f o r
the opposition - the v a l i d p o i n t that l a r g e - s c a l e campaingning before exam time would
mean that the candidates' exam r e s u l t s would be somewhat affected; t h i s might act as a
deterrent to good candidates. The f i n a l r e s u l t : 206 f o r , 108 against: 209 votes were
r e q u i r e d . There were a l s o a few abstentions. The meeting was, i n c r e d i b l y enough,

Other points of the meeting i n b r i e f : two t e c h n i c a l motions passed were, f i r s t ,
thejt 'disguised' or part-time students be members of ICU, and second, that the welfare
o f f i c e r , E x t e r n a l A f f a i r s o f f i c e r , and ULU agent be e l e c t e d from the union f l o o r . The
UGC has given ICU a £ 9 0 0 0 f u r n i t u r e grant f o r the student houses. S u r p r i s i n g l y enough,
the minutes of the l a s t meeting were i n c o r r e c t ; at l e a s t somebody n o t i c e d .
The meeting was adjourned f o r a continuation next Thursday f o r a marathon motion
from Derek Boothman. Whether Thursday's meeting w i l l be as l i v e l y , worthwhile or
quorate, i s very dubious, Thursday's motions w i l l give a chance f o r another crack at
getting P r e s i d e n t i a l e l e c t i o n s from the Union f l o o r ,
LETTjR "ALL THE WAY WITH RAY'
Dear S i r ,
Although a l o t of E d i t o r i a l i n FELIX has been i n connection w i t h Ray P h i l l i p s , our
Union P r e s i d e n t , I have f a i l e d to notice any c r e d i t given to him, or appreciation f o r
h i s worko
Do I get the impression that c e r t a i n members of Council are t r y i n g to run Mr,
P h i l l i p s down? I f t h i s i s so, I think i t i s time some of us took time off to show our
a p p r e c i a t i o n , Ray P h i l l i p s has proved himself time a f t e r time to be very e f f i c i e n t
and capable of doing h i s job i n a very competent manner, I am sure that h i s whole
i n t e r e s t i s i n helping us to 'get a b e t t e r deal' and yet how many of us take an i n t e r e s t
i n the Union or attend i t s meetings - and how many of us take the trouble to show Ray
that we DO appreciate a l l he does f o r u s , and that h i s e f f o r t s are not i n vain?
May I say "Many thanks f o r your e f f o r t s i n h e l p i n g to acquire the long needed
Student Houses, Mr, P h i l l i p s , and many thanks f o r a l l you have done f o r us,"
Three cheers f o r our President, and I hope I am speaking f o r a l l of us when I say,
"We're behind you a l l the way, Ray,"
Yours f a i t h f u l l y
P . 3 . Baker - Chemical Engineering.
