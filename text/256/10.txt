LETTER
Dear S i r ,
It i s r e g r e t t a b l e that your report of D r . Rose's t a l k to the I . R . C . on "The Abuse
of Science i n Vietnam" d i d not extend to cover the discussions which followed. In this
not only were some of his b a s i c f a c t s queried but a l s o the conclusions which he drew
from other, unchallengeable, f a c t s , ( " T h e United States has conducted research on Plague
organisms"...." In the l a s t few years, i n South Vietnam, cases of Plague have markedly
i n c r e a s e d " . , . Thus? D r . Rose d i d not complete t h i s l o g i c a l sequence but, when i n v i t e d
to do so, had to admit that there i s no evidence whatever to suggest that the U . S .
employo. the use of such organisms i n South Vietnam).
In h i s e f f o r t s to portray the U . S . as a p a r t i c u l a r l y raasty G o l i a t h to the p r i s t i n e -
white V i e t Cong "Freedon Fighters" David, D r . Rose revealed himself as more i n t e r e s t e d
i n disseminating anti-American propaganda than discussing the b a s i c moral questions
involved i n the use of Science to conduct modern warfare. The i n t e r e s t s of the
s c i e n t i f i c corririunity would b e t t e r have been served i f D r . Rose had argued the case that
any type of war i s an abuse of Science, no matter who p u l l s the t r i g g e r or bhrows the bomb.
Yours f a i t h f u l l y
