Yea! Blessed be the Royal School of Mines
For they hath and always shall—See the light,
is showing another two
R.S.M
films tomorrow night at 6.45 in
Mech. Eng. 220 i.e. the large and
lovely Samantha Eggar in " The
Wild and the Willing," and also
the excessive and erotic, Mai
Zetterling in " Only two can
play." So Minesmen ask, per-
suade, bribe or threaten people to
come along, as well as yourselves,
so we can make some money for
Carnival and have a superb even-
ing.
On Sunday Mines will be de-
feating Gild7 (or something) in
the Technology Cup at Harling-
ton Stadium starting 2.30. There-
are still some tickets left, but
unfortunately no razors, flick-
knives, darts or coshes are being
allowed, nor is the singing of
lullabies or fighting on the ter-
races as their supporters have
threatened to go and tell Mr.
Seaford if this happens.
Footnote : The opinions expres-
sed in this column are not neces-
sarily those of R.S.M. Union but
you never know.
ICWords
Oh Pete if you know what I thought about you,
Your knees would turn scarlet
Your nose would turn blue,
The hairs on your legs would turn white,
Oh Pete I dream of you all the night.
I suffer from nightmares that drive me insane,
Will next year's knees set me aflame?
On Feb. the Fourteenth at the ICWA party
For three bob a go you can choose the next smarty.
His knees must be knobbly, not plump and round,
A new Mr. ICWA must be found.
Random bird.

After last weekend, memorable
for the Engineer's Dinner and
Dance—but also half session, a
quick glance around the Guilds
Sports scene shows a healthy sit-
uation The two Kugby XVs are
both having good seasons, with a
good balance of victory over de-
feat. ThefirstXV, led by 1'erry
Stephenson and Vice-Captain
Bruce Kettle have won many
games, including getting the better
of the police on two occasions—
revenge for Morphy Day! Guilds
have their eyes on the Sparkes
Cup—bets may be placed in the
Union Office !
Hockey, under Nigel Varian,
is having an equally good season
with a record of twice as many
victories as defeats—they have
already defeated Mines 4
—
1 in
the Stephenson Cup and are con-
fident of dealing with RCS in a
similar manner
The Soccer team, led by Gra-
ham Squires, have defeated RCS
2—0 in the Tech Cup with simi-
lar intentions for Mines when
they meet this week.
Finally just a mention that
Guilds-Mines Carnival tickets
will be on sale shortly—make
sure you get in there fast be-
cause the numbers are strictly
limited.
A seiies in which articles are
invited on subjects dear to the
writers' hearts.

I went to see " Fiddler on the
Roof " recently, having booked a
mere five weeks ahead for the
privilege. It was a show worthy
of its success, this due largely to
Topol, who sang " If T were a
Rich Man " with surprising sin-
cerity for one in his position. The
show ended with the scattering of
the Jewish village of the story-
line, by command of an intoler-
ant Czar. Inside five minutes,
however, the village was reunited
for the curtain call, at which the
appreciative audience put aside
its chocolates for a lengthy ses-
sion of clapping. It destroyed
any of the reality of poverty and
persecution that the show, per-
haps accidentally, had created for
me. This was just as well, since
London shows are meant just to
entertain and scarcely to involve,
the Westminster Theatre's pro-
gramme excluded.
As I sat waiting in the under-
ground later that evening, a clean-
ing woman in a new nylon over-
all passed by dragging from one
end of the platform to the other
a bucket full of dirty water, at the
end of a knotted fraying string.
The bucket rattled very loudly
and the dirty water splashed, but
the*, woman's face remained
blank, despite the quickfloodof
jokes about Neolithic mechanics.
It seemed an absurd task, since
surely the underground, of all
places, has heard of wheels? In
fact, it seemed so absurd that I
half expected her to break out
into a song-and dance routine for
the last great encore of the
evening : I like working on the
underground, the people always
say hullo! " She did not; nobody
likes cleaning the underground:
and nobody would say hullo- ex-
cept on the stage. Life ticks over
in sordid, unpleasant sights,
which as many people as possible
do their utmost to avoid. Wash-
ing from the slums waves in the
diesel fumes as the crack Pullman
express rolls into King's Cross.
Outside the glass-fronted heights
of Southside a yellow pool
marks the end of a twenty-first
birthday party. The dustcart
carries an aura of dirt about it;
but now it is called the refuse dis-
posal vehicle, and people can
safely ignore it.
In the underground again, the
nicest posters are sometimes
bestrewn with short, rough
words, and curious accompany-
ing sketches; but people can look
to the upright slot machine for
refuge.
FELIX is considering construc-
tive measures to rid the Lon-
doner of the jarring features that
intrude upon a melted-chocolates
world of disposable reality from
the stage, or the cinema, or
television. At least 36 per cent
of the editorial board are actively
considering the issue of free
sachets of deodorant and india-
rubber erasers with each copy of
FELIX. With these weapons
odious smells from the debris of
the Union bar will be easily re-
moved, at no cost to the viewer.
Efficient dark sunglasses are ob-
viously the next step. We should
follow the example of the late
Roines' campaign to clean up
London and kill a pigeon a day.
Better still, kill two hundred and
export them.
A poem by Christopher Logue
is about a rich widow who lives
cleanly in her meticulously swept
house; the last line runs, approxi-
mately : " But thank God, the
shit's still in her."

Management studies got off to aflyingstart much to the satisfac-
tion of Dave Wield our 13J St. Academic Officer. Miss Woodward
has given 3 lectures so far. average altcndcnce has been about 200.
The lectures form a series but each one is complete in itself so it
doesn't matter if you have missed the first few. They are intended
mainly for 2nd and 3rd year students but any P.G. who wishes to
come along may do so.
There was a young lady of Exeter
So pretty that men craned their necks at her
One went so far
As to wave from his car
The distinguishing mark of his sex at her.
Limericks—better than this one -are required for the RCS
