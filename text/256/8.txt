It was dull, overcast, windy
and cold when eleven fit, strong
and virile young men donning the
bright red shirts of Imperial
College took the field at Q.M.C.
last Wednesday. After a couple
of days of rain the pitch was wet,
sticky and somewhat heavy, hut
this caused no trouble to those
red shirted demons from South
Kensington; mud could not slow
down these powerful men.
The game commenced at a fast
and unbelievable pace, the few
inside forwards undoubtedly
covering at least a mile of groand
in the first five minutes. When
the I.C. inside-left had been re-
vived by smelling salts, the game
continued at a slightly slower
pace but still scintillating football
was produced.
The referee was fantastic and
some of his decisions had the
crowd screaming in amazement;
the climax of his magnificent per-
formance came after a chest high
tackle on I.C.'s inside right when
he awarded a drop-out from the
twenty five.
After ninety minutes the eleven
I.C. heroes trooped proudly off
the field, heads held high after
their superb performance and if
Q.M.C. had not scored 6 goals to
I.C.'s 0 they would probably
have gone completely off their
heads. i
However, I.C. has vowed to
win the next three sets 6-2, 6-3,
6-1.

Hockey
U.L. CUP REPLAY
At the end of last term, I.C.
played Barts Hospital in the
first round of the U.L. Cup. It
was a hard fought game, col-
oured by memories of our de-
feat in the final last year by the
same side, and it resulted in a
1 -all draw.
On Wednesday 17th January,
the replay was played at Harling-
ton. The pitch was moist, but
firm, thus the ball ran wcil and
the players were hard pushed,
after the Christmas vacation, to
keep up with it. Barts played the
4-2-3-1-1 system which seemed to
give them much more room and
they grasped control of the game.
Half-way through the first half
they scored and, as *?ften happens
in a Cup game, they closed the
game up, concentrating much
more on defence.
I.C. tried very hard to break
this defence and in doing so were
awarded a fair number of short
corners, but none of these were
taken full advantage of. Thus the
game was allowed to labour
through the second half with no
further score.
Result: St. Bartholomew's Hos-
pital 1, I.C. 0.
Cross couru y
After their convincing win in
the UL championships the first
team were determined to over-
haul Borough Road College in
the London League. Unfortu-
nately international Barry Jones
was unable to Tun because of
injury and IC finished second
only a few points behind Borough
Road. The race was run on IC's
home course in Richmond Park
and the going was very firm, re-
sulting in an extremely fast pace.
The scorers for 1C were Nick
Barton 3rd, Norman Morrison
4th, Tony Mason 12th, Howard
Smith 18th. in Jones 24th and
Ashley Deans 31st.
Entries are now pouring in for
the Hyde Park Relay which is the
largest road relay in theworid an.
organised by Imperial College on
February 17th. About 110 teams
are expected to be competing and
this means almost 800 athletes!
Each team consists of 6 runners
who each run a 3 mile leg round
the serpentine. Last year the
race was won by Edinburgh with
IC twenty first. However this
year IC have one of their strong-
est teams ever so please come
and cheer the race which starts at
3 p.m. by the Serpentine. Would
anybody who is willing to put up
a member of one of the German
teams coming over for two nights
please contact me a. ,

Netball:
Royal Holloway came to I.C.
to play Netball in the morning of
Saturday 27th January. The
teams were evenly matched and
a hard, fast game ensued with the
score even throughout most of
the game. Towards the end of
the match, Imperial deservedly
pulled away to win 20-17, The
netball team is having its best
»eaSOn for a long time, and sup-
potters from Weeks Hall played
their usual part.
Hockey:
In the same afternoon the
ladies hockey team played Royal
Holloway II team. Imperial were
one player short and the team in-
cluded layers who had never
played jre, but what they
lacked in experience they made
up for in enthusiasm and tenacity.
The eventual result was an eight-
three win for 1CWA.
Badminton :
On Wednesday 31st January
the ladies Badminton team played
Royal Holloway at Nine Eims
Baths. In a close game ICWA
played well to win 6-3. This was
probably due to the presence and
support of the I.C. Men's Bad-
minton team—who also won their
match.
Special congratulations to a
certain Icwarian who played in all
three matches.
