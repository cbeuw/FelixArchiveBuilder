How to make your
.Degree go further
An IC girl's year in Africa
Joan Lakin graduated in physics at IC in 1965 and subsequently
obtained a Postgraduate Certificate of Education at the University of
London Institute of Education. She 'hen applied to Voluntary Service
Overseas and was sent to Nigeria j om year as a physics teacher.
Joan taught at the Methodist Girls' High School in Lagos. Air travel
to and from Nigeria was paid for and arranged by VSO. She received
a clothing allowance of £40 before leaving England, and was paid at
the rate of £700 p.a. by the Nigerian Government. Rent-free accom-
modation was provided. She received a resettlement allowance of
£100 from VSO on her return to England, which was quite useful as
she i .JW back at IC as a postgraduate.
Joan arrived in I.Mgos shortly after the second military coup
which put Major General Gowon in charge of the Federal Military
Government. Her stay was overshadowed by the political unrest
which culminated in the secession of the Eastern Region (Biafra) from
the Federation.
In order to give an impression of her stay in Nigeria we print here
extracts from letters written from Lagos to her family.
"1 am now slowly getting used to Lagos, although I bated it
atfirst,with the filth, smells and beggars. Also people stare all the
time. I can't get used to the long nights with all the noise of fruit
bats, crickets, and mysterious shufflings and patterings.
I have aflatto myself on the school compound and below me two
other VSO girls share a similar flat. At the moment we are trying to
get used to our servants, Michael the cook and Matthias the " small
boy." Unfortunately they are a necessary evil because the climate
drains all one's energy away. We have found that even a simple job
soon wears us out, even though it is now the end of the wet season and
is relatively cool.
" My school seems very well organised. The principal is Austra-
lian and the deputy Dutch. Both are very nice and helped us over our
first few days.
Keen Pupils
" Last weekend I had a ghastly attack of dysentery. Fdunately
I had some sulphonamide drugs to take in the event of such an occur-
rence, and they cleared it up in about 24 hours. It was rather
frightening though, and my tummy felt funny for several days after-
wards.
" I started school on Tuesday and at the moment feel absolutely
exhausted. We start at 8.10 a.m. and finish, ostensibly, at 2.10 p.m.
with two breaks, one of ten minutes and one of forty-five minutes.
Yesterday and today however, I have still been there at 3.15 p.m.
for various reasons, and of course there's a couple of hours marking
and lesson preparation to be done in the evening. This school is to
Lagos what St. Paul's is to London. The standard is very high—
they are all frighteningly keen on
maths and physics
I have been told that every
girl with very few exceptions
dreams of being a mathematician
or physicist, and consequently
I am treated by the pupils with
an awe and reverence which does
not endear me to the rest of the
staff. There were three new
teachers to be introduced to the
school at assembly on Tuesday.
The first two were quietly re-
ceived, but I received a round of
applause.
Last Saturday a man from the
British Council and his wife took
six VSO's and three contract
teachers on a canoe trip followed
by lunch. We went ten miles out
of Lagos along the road to
Ibadan and were paddled by
natives in dugout canoes along
a sluggish brown river fringed
with mangroves. It was- very
still and quiet—I felt just like
Mungo Park ! On the way back
.into Lagos we were stopped by
an army road-block.

1 EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.7
Your accounts of blustery Oc-
tober days and autumn gardens
make me feel very homesick, es-
pecially as the climate is so
ghastly here at the moment. The
temperature stays at a few de-
grees above 80 both day and
night. That wouldn't be too bad
if it weren't for the humidity. I
feel as though I'm in a con-
tinuous Turkish bath and like
everyone else feel very listless and
bad-tempered.
Night Club
We have justfinishedexams at
school and yesterday I marked
the last of the exam papers. The
results aren't very good. Most
of them failed physics, which
didn't really surprise me. They
learn the work very well, but
they don't make any attempt to
understand it, which is essential
in physics. I am very glad that
the School Certificate practical
exam is over. It was an awful
headache borrowing the appara-
tus and putting it together.
On Saturday we are having a
VSO party to celebrate Jean's
birthday. This is to counteract
the effect of the missionaries and
other expatriates who are all very
"respectable." I don't know if
I told you about our visit to a
Nigerian night club where we
drank lots of Nigerian beer and
tried dancing the " highlife " for
thefirsttime.
Holiday
Straight after Christmas, Jean
and I flew to Ghana, where we
had a wonderful holiday. Ghana
is a beautiful country with a
tremendous variety of scenery,
ranging from dense tropical
forest in the south to semi-desert
in the north. We were able to
travel right to the border with
Upper Volta northwards, and as
far as Taki

Nigerian Men
Last week, two girls from
school died from tetanus which
they developed after having il-
legal abortions. One of them
was a girl I taught. It was very
upsetting. Although they are
older than girls at home, they are
much less wc 'v and Nigerian
men take advantage of them.
They really make me sick.
Polygamy is legal so they have
two or three wives and " girl-
friends" as well. Also its the
accepted thing that if a girl
wants to get on in her job, she
has to be prepared to sleep with
the appropriate man. I don't sup-
pose those two girls were com-
pletely blameless, but when I
think what happened to them, it
really makes me furious.
Everyone says that it is much
cooler when the rains come as
they ought to do fairly soon—
we've had one or two good
storms in the last few weeks.
I'm writing this at Jos in
Northern Nigeria. We are on
holiday from school and Judy
and myself decided to visit the
North. We left Lagos last Mon-
day and travelled seven hun-
dred miles by train to Kano.
From Kano we got a lift to
Zaria. On Fridays all the Mus-
lems gather at the mosque to
pray, so we went to see them.'
One old Muslein offered to di-
vorce one of his three wives and
marry me. He even said he'd
give me a dowry !
Judy and I flew down from
Kaduna the day after a plane
had been hi-jacked by the East.
We didn't know about it at the
time, but wondered why there
were so many soldiers at Kaduna
and Lagos airports.
Moods
' daresay you know that Ni-
g is in a state of emergency.
I think the next step will be
Ojukwu's reaction. If he decides
to secede as now s
e
e
m
s
* probable,
there could well be civil war. I
hope to be coming home exactly
nine weeks today. 1 shall be fly-
ing back on a BOAC VC10
which should be quite an experi-
ence.
It's remarkable how one's
moods change. Only a week or
two ago, I was beginning to feel
quite attached to Nigeria, and
thinking how sorry I should be
to leave, whereas now, eight
weeks seems like eternity.
I've been very busy at school
lately, working out a new maths
syllabus, preparing a list of phy-
sics apparatus we need and mak-
ing further arrangements for our
Science Day.
Bombs
I did write to you a week ago,
but thought better of posting the
letter. Lagos was very tense, and
I was rather frightened, so it was
an awful letter.
Yesterday I gave a tea party
(pop and biscuits) for my class—
there are sixteen of them. I en-
joyed it very much, and I think
they did. We played Beatles"
records and they looked at all my
photos of mum, dad, etc.
You may have heard we had
• another bomb in Yuba last Wed-
nesday. There was another one
elsewhere in Lagos, but fortu-
nately it didn't go off properly.
The one in Yuba was about
three-quarters of a mile away
from us and made the house
shake. The explosives were in 3
petrol tanker outside a cinema
and quite a lot of people were
killed—rather more than the offi-
cialfigureof three.
I received my ticket home yes-
terday.
