COUNCIL COOLS
- Duckett Resigns
What must have been an all-
time record number of observers
—12 in ail watched the Mara-
thon 5-hour Council meeting a
week last Monday
Rumours of mass resignations
and no confidence motions in the
President proved to be unfounded
and most members appear to be
fairly satisfied with the outcome.
After the copious corrections to
the minutes (another record ?) in-
cluding one motion corrected to
passed instead of defeated, mat-
ters arising finished one hour
after the start, the only inform-
ation of interest not generally
known being that an appeals
board of three will probably be
set up for offenders in Halls of
Residence. The probable con-
stitution of this would be Mr.
Stephenson, the Senior Warden,
the President of the Union and a
warden of a Hall not involved in
the dispute.
And so to the motions. Work-
ing parties were set up to pro-
duce Standing Orders for Union
Meetings, to look into the revi-
sion of allocation of Union places
in Hall, the constitution of the
Felix, Phoenix and Carnival
Boards and the Student Finance
Committee, the arrangements for
Freshers Day and the provision
of special facilities for P.G.s es-
pecially out of term time. A mo-
tion to set up a working party to
look into the possibility of stu-
dent representation on the Gov-
erning Body was withdrawn when
the President explained that he
had consulted the Rector about
this. For full details sec story
on page 4.
A motion proposed by Mal-
colm Duckett that Council should
meet at least once a fortnight,
thus taking over many of the
duties of the Executive, which
would be replaced by an " emer-
gency committee " was consider-
ably watered down and it was
finally decided to hold at least
three this term as an experiment.
Another part of the same motion
that Council meet vear rens once
a term became that a nilot meet-
ing with year reps will be held
soon.
A rush of people seconded
Miss Pearson's motion approving
the principle of mixed Halls ot
Residence, which was passed
nem con. Ian Wells, President
of Mines, proposed that one rep
from each constituent college
should be elected at the Union
AGM, this narrowly squeaking in
on the President's casting vote.
Other points worth mentioning
were that the owners of approxi-
mately 30 parking places, which
are vacant each day, mostly be-
longing to students, would be
likely to lose them if they were
not used. The Rector is looking
into the question of careers ad-
vice, as well as lectures on civil
rights, insurance and taxation for
General Studies.
Mr. Duckett wrote this letter to
his resignation.
Sir,
Following my resignation from
Council I wish to make a state-
ment as to my reasons; and
make some comments on the pre-
sent state of the Union, and,
more particularly, of Council. I
wish to do this as I feel the
Union is totally uninformed as to
what goes on, and as their ex-
representative on Council, I am
in the position to inform them.
I have resigned from Council
because of the greatest possible
disgust and disillusionment in the
way the Union is managed. The
management (i.e. Council, not the
Executive as they seem to think)
is incompetent to run the Union
in a way beneficial to most stu-
dents here.
From the top to the bottom the
majority of Council members,
with one or two exceptions, are in-
competent, reactionary and fail to
act in the interests of the Union,
and even fail to hold any respect
for the Union as a whole.
The Executive is guilty of fail-
ing to carry out their duties pro-
perly, and have shown a flagrant
disregard for Student opinion and
the Union Bye Laws. On at least
four occasions they have ignored
Bye Laws, formulated to prevent
the abuse of Executive power and
to protect the welfare of ordinary
student members. Three (and
possibly another one) of these
FELIX explaining the reasons for
concern discipline, which is Coun-
cil-controlled, on which the
Executive took action. Twice this
was after a warning from Council
to cease this practice. On the
other they failed to publish an
agenda to a Union Meeting, the
one concerning parking charges
(which should have drawn large
numbers), resulting in yet another
inquorate meeting.
The Secretary has failed to
write a letter when instructed to
by Council, although he did very
much later when he was " re-
minded." This concerned an
apology to another college for
inconvenience caused to them,
and therefore a very urgent mat-
ter.
The President has continually
acted as though the Union was an
autocracy, and shown total dis-
regard for the wishes of Council.
His behaviour at Council Meet-
ings has been appallingly flippant
and discourteous to all, and has
thus failed to gain the respect of
any large fraction of students.
When asked by Council, the body
which elected him, or at least
twenty of the twenty-two student
members, to hold a Council
Meeting in the second week of
this term he refused to do so.
Instead he made it abundantly
clear that he did not feel answer-
able to Council. This was in the
face of a large number of impor-
Duckett Hits Out
Malcolm M a t t
A motion by Andrew Jordan
regretting that a council meeting
was not held in the second week
of term, when 20 student mem-
bers of Council signed a letter re-
questing one, was passed by three
votes to two, and that this shall
not be construed as a precedent
was passed nem con.
Finally, after a little obstruc-
tion by the chair, a letter handed
to Mr. Phillips by Mr. Duckett,
before he left the meeting during
a short break for refreshment, was
read. This was Duckett's resig-
nation, read at yesterday's Union
Meeting and amplified in a state-
ment printed in this issue. A
vote of thanks for his work on
Council was given to him.
tant reform motions placed for
the meeting. Instead he made a
mockery of the whole affair by
calling an informal meeting at
which no business could be done.
He then proceeded to tell Council
what was wrong With it and also
discussed motions ,for the next
Council Meeting. The whole affair
was a farce, and in no way amus-
ing.
In an attempt to bring about
constitutional revision to combat
the rot at the top of the Union
and to check the illegal action of
the Executive certain action was
proposed. This action was sup-
ported by a majority of Council
outside of an actual meeting even
down to a no confidence motion
on the President if he failed to
hold the requested Council Meet-
ing. I did not table such a mo-
tion as, with one or two excep-
tions, these people (all " repre-
senting " student interest) backed
down, with one or two notable
exceptions, as they did on the
measures to restructure Execu-
tive control.
So these people who agreed to
do something constructive, which
they agreed was in the best inte-
rests of the Union, failed to hon-
our their verbal bond. I can only
conclude that they are neither
honest nor acting in the interests
of the students. It is mainly dis-
illusionment (with these ipeoole,
who claim they are progressive,
that has led me to resign. I am
unable to work with them to do
the things the union knew I stood
for when they elected me. At
least the Executive (with on6 ex-
ception) is straight-forward and
NUS Protests
Grants Cut
Two weeks ago Barbara Hedge, IC External Affairs Officers and
Mike Edwards foimedtnelC delegation at the M S organised meeting
at Birmingham University to decide about action on the grants cuts.
Tine following is Barbara Hedge's Account of the meeting :—
The NUS Executive was of the opinion that we should not accept
the 50 per cent cut in any increase proposed by the Grants Advisory
Board without negotiation. This meeting was held so that the
Executive could find out the wishes of the majority of students and
act accordingly.
Speakers were heard from the regional groups of NUS and the
major student political societies and finally from individual
universities.
Nottingham is the only univer-
sity which as a whole dissociates
itself from any campaign to raise
the grant. The points considered
wrong with the grants system at
the moment were : —
(1) In 1965, the grant was cut by
£30 from the standard considered
necessary in 1961 and the prob-
able increase in 1968 will not
bring us up to the 1965 level.
There seems no point in having a
Grants Advisory Board if its
findings are ignored.
(2) Even if students can manage
in '68 will they be able to in '71
when the next grants review will
be undertaken.
(3) The Local Education Autho-
rities have had to cut expenditure.
This is liable to cut discretionary
awards e.g. for vacation courses.
(4) Some students e.g. married or
i.i. lure students suffer badly in
some counties but are alright in
others. By devaluation students
abroad lost £30 overnight. These
are just a few anomalies.
The reasons why a grants cam*
paign should be supported, and
how. are : —
(1) The cut is imposed "for the
time being." If this means 3
years, students will be hit badly.
Ask for a review after 1 year.
(2) London Intercollegiate Hall
fees have already gone up to
certainly more than the increase
in the grant if the cut takes place.
Other hall and refectory prices
are sure to go up for next session.
If we don't ask for an increase in
the grant, it was proposed by a
number of factions that we ask
for a freeze on such prices.
(3) Students will find th?t they
have to take evening jobs as well
as vacation jobs in order to pay
their way. This could result in
ooen. So too are one or two other
Council members, the ones I am
in basic disagreement with and
therefore cannot work with. But
these neonle who promised sup-
nort, but failed to eive it. or. as
in one case, opposed it. have
proved themselves incapable of
carrying out their duties.
Resigning from Council was
not an easy decision, but one I
had to make. We should all be
concerned with the rot at the top
(these are an RCS Fresher's
words), as if there is disinterest
and bad handling at the top. what
can anybody expect but apathy
in the Union?
I am making this statement be-
cause T am worried at what is
happening here, and think you
should know. Basically it is up
to all*at us to put things right
so please.take an. interest and
some action. The last Colcutt was
too true to be funny.
MALCOLM DUCKETT
an increased failure rate and a
bigger waste of public money.
(4) Class distinction will occur as
working class families will not be
able to rely on parents giving
them extra money so they won't
come to university.
(5) If we accept the cut we are in
effect saying that we can manage
without it and that we had too
much in '61.
The reasons we should accept
such a cut are : —
(1) A student only has to live on
a limited income for 3 years
whereas old age pensioners etc.
have no increase to look forward
to.
(2) If we say we can't live on the
grant we are offered, the alterna-
tive is loans.
(3) Such a campaign will give us
a really bad public image.
(4) We don't need the money.
The majority of views agreed
with a campaign to make sure
that students had enough money
to live on with the anomalies in
the grant system removed Very
few people wanted immediate
militant action. Reasoning with
the government was thought the
most sensible idea as the claims
are justified.
Kings' Estimate
Graham Searle. President of
Kings Union, has written a report
giving the average minimum ex-
penditure for students in London,
allowing only 10/- a week for
concerts, theatres , tobacco, alco-
hol, wireless licence and other
forms of entertainment. Alto-
gether £69 10s a year (27/- a
week) on personal expenditure is
allowed, these items are not
catered for in the NUS recom-
mendations, but Searle writes,
" trunk calls home, going home
for a weekend or half-term, dental
or optical treatment, extra fuel
needs during an illness, contribu-
tions to charities and appeals,
travelling expenses for society
visits, fares or teas for sports
fixtures, the celebration of a 21st
or an engagement etc." are all
outside the expenditure allowance
catered for in the NUS recom-
mendations, although most peo-
ple of our age would regard these
as essential.
He suggests £450 for living in
Hall, £460 in lodgings and £345
at home.
APOLOGY
Unfortunatelv, due to lack of
space, a large amount' of conv re-
ceived for this issue has had to be
held over until the next one, or
cut altogether. FELIX apolo-
gises to those people who have
contributed material which has
not been included.
