The
Colcutt
Clique
Sir,
There was a time (or so the
story goes) when " Colcutt " gave
vent to some much needed and
relevant criticism on the state of
affairs at I.C.
Now, however, it seems to
have become a mere extension of
the sort of cliquish introspection
which it purports to despise. For
an article to attempt to satirize
the actions of a body of people
supposedly divorced from the
mass of students is obviously
futile. Since few people know
the personalities involved few
people are going to appreciate the
analogies drawn.
It's about time Colcuit stopped
boring the average I.C. student
and wasting his allocated space.
If he must air his enormous wit,
perhaps he could distribute a
fortnightly quip-sheet to his fel-
low council members.
Meanwhile, perhaps we could
have more constructive criticism
from him in Felix.

Sir,
Since my first day at I.C. last
October ,1 have had " apathy "
stuffed down my throat, one way
or another, and I am sick to the
back teeth of it.
Everywhere I turn I hear the
moans and groans of frustrated
and lethargic second and third
years, complaining bitterly about
this amorphous apathy from
which I.C. is suffering. And when
I retort that they have only them-
selves to blame, when I declare
that I do not intend to allow my
mind to be anaesthetised, they
smile patronisingly, as if to say
" You're a fresher (—distasteful
word—), you wait until you've
become old and wise like us and
see what you think then."
" Old and wise " my sweet —!
Apathy is what one associates
with morons, not with intelligent
young people—or did I get it
wrong about the " top five per
cent"? Either way, it's the last
thing I would have expected to
have found here.
In fact, it's not apathy at all
that has I.C. by the throat. What
it all boils down to is that life at
I.C. is not as cushy as we expec-
ted it to be, and this has led
some people to adopt negativistic
attitudes and to blame their own
laziness on such a conveniently
nebulous thing as apathy. And
it is those few rotten apples which
have spoilt the barrel.
The amount I could write on
this subject you wouldn't have
room to print, but let me briefly
C O L C U T T
An interesting letter from the
Director to our Resident clown
came into my hands the other
day :
Dear Flippant,
It has come to my notice that
you and council are staying up
beyond your bedtimes. How do
you do it when you accomplish so
little ? I note also that there is
a resignation epidemic among
council. One down, three or
four with heavy fevers, and who
knows how many to come. Most
of you started your jobs around
the same time as myself. Per-
haps the resignations are a result
of disillusion due to the obstacles
which rise before anyone who
attempts to change anything : I
too have discovered the apparent
immobility here. I therefore wish
to inform you, Mr. Resident, of
my decision to resign.
Yours, P.
After this startling revelation,
anything else shades into impor-
tance.
Are you looking for entertain-
ment ? Try one of EC's most
amazing shows, now in its eighth
fantastic month: The Cra-;;
World of Keith Guy, with his
own grouo, Ents.
And who's the promoter ? The
executive ? The promoter doesn't
always aoprove : Martin I ack
told Ents " I ast year we had
cattle-markets for neople tif't like
me; this year you're trying to
make them into dances." And
Ents don't always approve.
Seems the exec, with council's
backing has stopped them using
the Union lower lounge for hops.
Why ? Maybe so that all those
alcoholic Icwarians you see lying
drunkenly around the lower
lounge won't have to miss out
Saturday nights.
Or maybe for all the people
who use the lounge every Satur-
day night. A maximum of 40,
Ents reckoned last term on those
weekends they were using the
top refectory instead. And some
of the 40 had come from the hop.
Is this minority worth satisfying
when there are similar and better
facilities on the same campus in
Southside ?
And why, you may ask, do
Ents want to use the lower
lounge rather than the top refec-
tory. You can get a better at-
phere in the lower lounge; the
lower lounge has a much better
floor for dancing. Most of us
know the usual atmosphere in the
top refectory and the usual smell
of chippies. The plastic fairytale
used it because there weren't
enough people for the lower
lounge.
But there are three factions con-
cerned : the executive, the Ents
committee and our old friend,
Keith Guy. Guy, we all know, is
an organising genius. He said
three weeks before Guy Fawkes
night that he would get the fire-
works. But Dermott Corr and
Jacques Robinson had to chase
some up on November 3rd. And
he asked two people to fix the
group for one week at the plastic
fairytale: both arrived. Fortu-
nately one played for free.
But a last question for you ?
Do you like Ents publicity this
year ? Martin Lack is sceptical:
This year," he told Ents,
" You're sending out works of
art, not posters." Perhaps if
Ents don't go to pot, they'll turn
to it.
say what 1 think could be done
lest all of us—Mr. Malcolm
Duckett included—are drowned
in this " apathetic " cess which is
I.C.'s heritage.
The prime objective should be
the unification of the student
body. As it stands at the mo-
ment the word Union is a mis-
nomer, and the blame for it is
shared equally between the totally
uninspiring and wet-blanket
leadership of the Union Exec,
and those who have allowed these
people to obtain such office.
Radical changes are needed, in
addition to changing the Presi-
dential Election system, I advo-
cate the introduction of a sab-
batical year as the only way of
getting an undergraduate Presi-
dent without it becoming the con-
solation prize for a Pass degree
Inter-college rivalries should be
revived as a means of encourag-
ing active participation, and
greater involvement in student
affairs; for an active body is a
healthy body, and active minds
will become stagnant if we choose
to ignore the facts.
The potential dangers of nega-
tivistic and couldn't-care-less atti-
tudes in such a renowned seat of
learning as I.C. are frightening,
and unless the myth of apathy is
exploded I can only imagine that
this, my generation, will become
as void, as sterile as the one which
runs this, our country, at the pre-
sent moment.

Em cipation
Sir,
R s
e incident f the
four . /an n the Unu.u Bar,
I find their auion commendable,
and your comment on it deplor-
able.
Whether or not you and others
like you consider the fair sex to
be inferior, they do have equal
rights, and as there exists no
Union bye-law which forbids
their presence in the Union Bar
they are free to use it—though
I'm not surprised at the revulsion
which the mere thought Of doing
so normally causes them.
So for your fears that women
are trying to dominate us, have
you stopped to consider that it
may be simply that they are dis-
satisfied with the way in which
we men handle things. Mayhs
a Lady President of I.C.U. would
be a vast improvement—she cer-
tainly couldn't do worse. And
whv otherwise should I.C.W.A.
find the purpose of its existence
to be " to safeguard . . . the in-
terests of women students ?"
C. J. KENT.
and
concessions
Sir,
With reference to the Editor's
comment in the last issue of
Felix, I should like to put it on
record that I support the eman-
cipation of women at I.C. 1 will-
ingly support their use of the
men's lavatories, providing re-
ciprocal facilities are granted.
Yours lustingly,
DAVE GRATTAN,
Chemistry III.
Surgeries
If all goes well, Council floor
reps are to hold so-called " sur-
geries " twice a week. The plan
is an attempt to increase ex-
change of ideas and information
between Union member and
Council man. Iwo floor reps
will be in Committee Room A
between 1 and 2 on Tuesday and
Thursday to listen to any griev-
ances, ideas or information trom
the Unionfloor,and to explain or
clarify any situations necessary,
saiy. The idea of Andrew Jor-
dan, the scheme should begin
soon.
Linstead Hall
A framed portrait photograph
will be presented by the Union to
Linstead Hall at its opening cere-
mony next autumn. Originally,
a painting was to be presented,
but with a collection realising
only £18 from Union members,
the Union could only afford 50
gns. for it. The painting was then
found unacceptable and is now
mouldering in the Union Office.
Secretaries
Mr. C. C. Moore, an Assistant
Secretary of the College, left on
February 2nd to take up the
Secretaryship of the Royal Free
Hospital School of Medicine.
Mr. B. L. Lloyd Davies, at
present Assistant Registrar,
University College of Swansea
will succeed him.
FELIX wishes Mr. Moore
great success in his new appoint-
ment.
