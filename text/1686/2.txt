The review could
mean humanities
degrees charge less.

T
heresa May
announced her
planned review
of post-18 ed-
ucation in a speech in
Derby earlier this week.
Speaking at Derby
College on Monday 19th
February, May outlined
her plans for the future of
higher education, specifi-
cally potential changes to
how courses at higher ed-
ucation institutions would
be funded. She seemed
to suggest that courses
would charge variable
amounts depending on
their earning potential, a
position later backed up
by Education Secretary
Damian Hinds.
A major review of
funding in higher educa-
tion was promised by the
Conservatives last May,
as part of their election
manifesto. The move
came amid increasing
concern over the amount
of debt faced by students
in higher education, and
Changes to graduation seating put in place
London may have to
sit apart, under a new
ticketing system put in
place.
This year the respon-
sibility of the ticketing
and seating allocation
will be taken over from
College by the Royal
Albert Hall. The College
told Felix: “their profes-
sional systems are better
equipped to manage an
event of this scale, which
will lead to an easier tick-
eting process and a better
overall experience on the
day.”
However, the change
means students attending
with more than two guests
will have no guarantee
the guests will be sitting
together. Graduands are
guaranteed two guest
tickets, with the option to
purchase more on a first
come first served basis at
a later date. While in pre-
vious years the College’s
manual system would
seat these guests together,
under the new system this
is not guaranteed.
One student Felix
spoke to, who is due to
graduate from the Royal
Albert Hall later this year,
said they were “saddened
to find out my parents and
my partner will not be
sitting next to each other
at my graduation.”
“I understand that with
the increasing number of
graduands some changes
need to be made for the
ceremonies to be sustain-
able. However, I still do
not fully understand why
seating places are not
allocated after sales. If
doing it manually is not
efficient, why not make
it an Imperial project
to fix it? It would be a
good UROP project, for
example”
“I would love to have
my parents and my partner
sit together, considering
they were both instrumen-
tal to my success during
my degree. I think a better
solution exists, and this
new system is not it.”
A spokesperson for the
College told Felix: “While
we cannot guarantee that
additional ticket-holders
will be seated with the
original party, students
should contact the Royal
Albert Hall Box Office
to discuss options should
their additional ticket(s)
request be successful.
Where possible the Royal
Albert Hall will do their
best to accommodate
these requests.”
This year’s postgradu-
ate graduation ceremony
will be held on the 2nd
May, 2018.
the long-term sustainabil-
ity of the current model.
Currently, students leave
university with £50,000
debt on average.
The review, which is
chaired by Philip Augar,
is set to run for a year.
May’s speech contained
suggestions at what pos-
sible outcomes might be.
One of the most contro-
versial plans would be to
introduce variable fees for
different courses, based
on a number of factors,
including the value the
course has to the UK
economy. In her speech,
May said “the level of
fees charged do not relate
to the cost or quality of
the course.”
This suggestion was
supported by Hinds.
Speaking on BBC Radio
4’s Today programme,
he said “There are dif-
ferent considerations for
courses. There is the cost
to put it on, there’s the
return to the individual,
and there’s also the return
to our economy and to
society as a whole.”
If variable fees are
introduced, it is likely
that non-STEM subjects,
which have lower gradu-
ate earning potential, will
end up charging less for
courses.
The move has attracted
criticism from a number
of sectors. Justine Green-
ing, the former Education
Minister, who was re-
placed earlier this year,
suggested that changes
would not do much to
impact social mobility,
and expressed concern
that they may end up with
“a system where young
people from more disad-
vantaged backgrounds
feel like they ought to
do one of the cheaper
degrees.”
Angela Rayner, the
shadow education secre-
tary, said: “charging more
for the courses that help
graduates earn the most
would put off students
from the most disadvan-
taged backgrounds from
getting these same quali-
fications.”
Richard Adams, The
Guardian’s education
editor, said the move
was “clear, simple, and
wrong”, pointing out that
some courses with the
highest graduate earning
potential were the cheap-
est to run, citing econom-
ics courses at institutions
like LSE.
There are also concerns
over the impact dropping
tuition fees could have:
an analysis by the London
Economics consultancy
firm has predicted that
dropping fees to £6,000
across all courses would
lead to a deficit of £1.169
billion per year.
May, who said her first
speech in parliament had
been on education reform,
said “the need for [a new
education system] has
never been greater”
One outcome the gov-
ernment has made it clear
they will not support,
however, is complete
removal of tuition fees, a
promise Labour made in
the run up to last year’s
general election. Speak-
ing in Derby, May said:
“those who benefit direct-
ly from higher education
should contribute directly
towards the cost of it.” – a
clear swipe at Labour’s
policy.
Tuition fees have been
a point of contention
for the government for
a number of years. In
2010, the cap of £3,225
was raised to £9,000 per
year, which sparked large
student protests. Initially,
the government had
predicted that a handful
of the top-performing
universities would raise
their tuition fees to the
maximum level, but the
vast majority of higher ed-
ucation institutions now
charge maximum fees.
In October, May an-
nounced plans to freeze
tuition fees at a maximum
of £9,250 per year, and
raisethethresholdatwhich
loans must be paid back to
£25,000. Originally, the
government had planned
to link rises in tuition fees
with the Teaching Excel-
lence Framework (TEF);
universities with gold and
silver ratings would have
been able to raise their
fees in line with inflation.
May also spoke about
the challenges faced by
students from lower soci-
oeconomic backgrounds,
highlighting that nearly
25% of students at top uni-
versities went to private
school. Newly-released
data showed Imperial was
among the worst-perform-
ing universities in the UK
in terms of state school
admission, with only
63.5% of intake last year
from state schools.

Life on the picket lines
T
his Thursday, the
striking Imperial
e m p l o y e e s ,
above all, looked
cold. Walking into uni-
versity at what I thought
was the punctual time of
8.55am, I passed people
who’d been standing on
the picket line since just
after 7am, passing out
leaflets to passersby, and
slowly losing all the feel-
ing from their hands. It
takes dedication, it seems,
to take part in a strike,
particularly on a bitter
February morning, when
you could easily nip into
a warm classroom.
But what was even
more impressive, for me
personally, was seeing the
students who came out
to support the strikers on
the picket lines, carrying
placards and wearing
UCU armbands. Imperial
often has a reputation, not
only for ‘world-renowned
research’, but also for
a complete and distinct
lack of getting involved in
politics. Whether people
feel they’re too busy with
their coursework to get
involved with activism, or
think the research they do
exists in a vacuum, with
no impact on the messy
world of policy (spoiler:
it doesn’t), students here
seem reluctant to engage.
Things were different
today. It might have been
a long time coming, but
the swell of support from
students who turned
out this morning felt
like something of a sea
change. I’ve been at
Imperial since 2012, and
the last time I remember
students getting this
involved with a campaign
was when #againstacton
was launched, to protest
College purchasing
student accomodation
outside zone 1 (spoiler:
it didn’t work). That was
over five years ago, and
since then I’ve witnessed
– and been part of – a
student body who seem to
shy away from politics.
What is it about these
strikes that could mark
the turning point? Maybe
it’s because students are
seeing the direct effect it’s
having on their education,
having to forego previous
time in tutorials in lectures
after staff have joined the
picket line. Or maybe
it’s because they believe
that – when universities
treat them like consum-
ers – they are entitled to
a refund since they’re
missing out on expensive
supervision. Or maybe
it’s just because the whole
world of politics has been
going to shit the last few
years, and we’re starting
to make ourselves heard.
Whatever the cause,
the effect was seen
this morning, as I and
Felix photographer Joe
followed the procession of
students as they made their
way up to the Blue Cube
Faculty Building, leaving
messages of support while
management staff looked
on. The atmosphere was
one of elation, tempered
by a palpable rage at
what the striking workers
were facing: an uncertain
financial future as their
pension scheme risks
being completely altered.
Speaking to those taking
part in the demonstration,
it was clear that – while
we might moan about
coursework deadlines and
SCR breakfasts – many
of us feel a lasting con-
nection to our lecturers,
tutors, and support staff.
The strike will be con-
tinuing for the next few
weeks, and I urge all of
you to not let this oppor-
tunity slip through your
fingers. They are fighting
for their future, and, by
extension, the future of all
of us – whether we want
to go into academia or
not. Now, more than ever,
is the time to turn up, and
get involved.
