Placards, picket lines, and protests: Felix reports on the first day of the UCU strike action
these strikes.”
Cross also highlighted
the impact these changes
could have on those who
want to pursue a career in
academia: “It was one of
the main personal reasons
for getting involved in the
strike. I’ve been consider-
ing a career in academia,
but this is seriously going
to disadvantage people
at a lower level. Those
striking are already in
the system, and they’ve
acquired a certain amount
of pension pay, but for us
there won’t be anything
guaranteed if the changes
go through.”
The concerns were
echoed by Abhijay Sood,
who helped organise the
student demonstration. He
told Felix: “I’m here to
show support for staff, not
only because I’m worried
about their pensions, but
selfishly too: as a student
this is bad for education
in general, and especially
bad for those of us who see
ourselves having future
careers in academia.”
Last week Union
Council voted to support
the strikes, passing a
paper that called on
“elected representatives
of ICU to support the
UCU position”. A number
of student Union repre-
sentatives were present
on the picket line on
Thursday morning, but
none of the paid Officer
Trustees (OTs) – Union
President and the four
Deputy Presidents – were
in attendance. Rhidian
Thomas, ICU’s Ethics and
Environmental Officer,
said it was “disappoint-
ing” they did not come:
“I’m very grateful at the
support the Union has
given us so far, but I’ve
emailed them about this
a lot of times, they knew
it was coming, and I’m
more than a little annoyed
they’ve not turned up.”
In a statement for Felix,
a Union representative
said: “Union Council
disruption to students is
kept to a minimum. Our
student leaders have been
working hard to achieve
Council’s objectives
alongside continuing to
represent and deliver for
students at all levels.”
The strikes are the cul-
mination of a long-run-
ning dispute between
UCU and Universities UK
(UUK), the group repre-
senting UK universities,
over changes to pension
schemes. Currently most
higher education institu-
tions are part of the Uni-
versity Superannuation
Scheme (USS), a defined
benefit scheme in which
employers pay in up to a
certain amount.
UUK want to switch
to a defined contribution
scheme, which would see
employees paying into
the pension pot, citing a
funding deficit of £7.5
billion – a figure UCU
disputes. An analysis by
Professor Michael Otsuka
of the London School of
Economics (LSE) sug-
gests employees may lose
up to 60% of their pension
under the new scheme.
T
he decision by UUK to move to a
defined contribution scheme has
recently come under increased
scrutiny, as they have been accused
of disproportionately taking into account the
views of wealthy Oxbridge colleges.
Michael Otsuka, a professor at the London
School of Economics (LSE) has estimated
around16Oxbridgecollegeswereincludedin
a key survey organised by UUK, which formed
the basis of switching pension schemes. In
the survey, which asked universities whether
they would prefer moving to a defined
contribution scheme that would offer less
risk to university finances, Oxbridge colleges
were more likely to support a scheme with
lower risk.
In total, 42% of the 116 responses received
in the survey were in favour of a less risky
scheme. However, those 116 institutions
included 16 Oxbridge colleges, as well as
Oxford and Cambridge themselves.
T
his week also saw the circulation of
a petition from students asking for a
portion of their tuition fees back. The
petition, which started by students
in the Electrical and Electronic Engineering
(EEE) Department, was circulated amongst
students by Imperial College Union (ICU)
academic representatives and members
of College staff. At the time of writing, the
petition has reached nearly 2000 signatures,
despite only being up for the past six hours.
The move comes as large numbers of
students lobby their universities asking for
partial refund of their fees. Earlier this week it
was reported that 70,000 students had signed
a number of petitions requesting money back
at more than 30 universities, with the number
of signatures rising at the rate of 10,000 per
day.
Many of those asking for refunds cite
frustration at the teaching they will miss, with
UCU estimating that nearly 600,000 teaching
hours will not be rescheduled. The frustration
students feel about missing out on teaching
is compounded by two other factors: the
high fees many students pay, particularly
international students; and the fact staff on
strike have their pay withheld. The Times
has estimated that Imperial could save up to
£500,000 in staff costs over the duration of
the strike.
UCU members voted
largely in favour of the
industrial action, with
88% of those balloted
supporting a strike. At
Imperial 58.5% of UCU
members voted, in line
with the national average.
Representatives from
the UCU told Felix they
had been told by manage-
ment the College could
afford to continue the
pension scheme – which
would cost up to 10% of
their excess income – but
had chosen not to.
Sood, who hoped the
strikes would encourage
students to “write to the
Provost, and ask him to
come back to the negoti-
ating table”, highlighted
the impact Imperial could
have by supporting their
staff: “I’m hoping that
by Wednesday UUK
with cede, and give their
current proposal a stay.
But some universities
will have more sway than
others, and Imperial is one
of them. We’re only going
to get the strike stopped
if Imperial College take
a position within UUK to
make a compromise.”
Already a number of
university heads have
asked UUK to come
back to the negotiating
table, including Warwick,
Essex, Loughborough,
Chief Financial Officer,
and James Stirling, the
College Provost, implies
Stirling misled staff when
he sent them an email
last October saying “our
preference would be to
maintain a defined benefit
structure for USS.” The
email claims that three
weeks earlier the College
had informed UUK they
would prefer “moving to a
defined contribution only
solution.”
The email, which has
been circulated among a
number of staff, says this
finding “casts a cloud over
your statements of future
intent in supporting a
better pension for staff.” It
goes on to say their posi-
tion has “shifted to one of
incoherence – financially,
historically, and morally”,
and asks them to be
“honest to staff” about
potential outcomes.
A YouGov poll, or-
ganised on the eve of
the strikes, showed only
2% of students thought
university staff were to
blame for the dispute,
and over 60% supported
Students ask for refund
Oxbridge overrepre-
sented in UUK analysis
the strikes. This support
was higher in universities
where strike action was
occurring, despite poten-
tial reductions in teaching
time.
The impact the strikes
have had on students at
Imperial is unclear, since
staff are not obliged to
inform the College they
plan to strike. A large
number of students have
received emails from their
departments informing
them to presume lectures
are still on, although
many have had lectures or
tutorials cancelled.
In a statement, a
College representative
told Felix: “We appre-
ciate students may have
concerns about potential
disruption but the College
will be open as usual and
departments are working
hard to ensure that teach-
ing and assessment activ-
ities continue as normal.
Any changes to schedules
will be communicated
by Departments. Advice
for students is available
online.”
“Students

support in

faculty staff”
voted to support the paper,
and the Officer Trustees
have been achieving the
objectives that Council
democratically set for
them. This did not include
a mandate to join the
picket line. The Council
discussion was clear that
Imperial College Union
would also work to ensure

Lancaster, and Gold-
smiths. Imperial College
London have said the
pensions dispute is “a
national dispute over
which [we] have no direct
control.”
