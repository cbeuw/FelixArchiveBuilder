Love, Life, and Cocaine on an Irish Rooftop
C
asey and Mikey
are stuck on a
rooftop, waiting
for the cops to
drive away – they’ve just
robbed a petrol station and
a house- Casey’s house to
be precise. It is on this
roof that they’ve found
themselves cornered by
the police. It’s not all bad
though: their robbery has
been somewhat successful
– they’ve managed to grab
a bag of cocaine and a
bottle of whiskey to share
between them. This is the
setting of John Donovan’s
debut play – two young
men stranded on a roof in
Ennis, a small, rural Irish
town.
Despite the deceptively
simple premise, If we got
some more cocaine… is
far from straightforward –
through its two characters
it comes to explore themes
of identity and sexuality,
family, poverty, small-
town mentality, and much
more. Yet, somehow, it
never feels contrived.
Mikey and Casey are
high on adrenaline and,
soon, on coke; trying to
find a way out of the sit-
uation they’re in. Mikey
is eager to escape from
the rooftop to get to the
party they’re supposed to
be going to – he wants to
‘show off’ Casey to his
friends. Casey, however,
is reluctant, almost
content to stay where they
are for just a little while
longer.
Their respective atti-
tudes to their sexualities
is one of the main themes
of the play. Mikey is
out and proud and has
been defending his sex-
uality through fist fights
for years now. Casey,
however, is still in the
closet, afraid of his violent
and homophobic stepdad,
who punches him for little
reason, and is likely to
be even more angry if he
finds out Casey is gay. It’s
more complicated though:
despite Mikey’s apparent
pride in who he is, he
can’t come to terms with
changing attitudes – his
ex is getting married to
another man, and he can’t
understand their desire
to publicise their rela-
tionship, stuck in a world
where he feels he needs to
constantly defend his sex-
uality. Casey is a similar
contradiction: he is afraid
to be out, but, at the same
time yearns for Mikey to
say he loves him.
Alan Mahon and Josh
Williams are fantastic as
Mikey and Casey respec-
tively. Mahon is part of the
original cast, having per-
formed in the play since
its debut in 2016, whereas
Williams has joined the
team for the play’s run
at Vault Festival. Their
differing experience with
the roles really doesn’t
show though because they
have a truly great chem-
istry and feed off each
other naturally. There’s
an awkwardness to their
relationship that perfectly
captures the confusion
of the characters who are
struggling to accept who
they are to each other.
Williams’ Casey wears
his vulnerability on his
sleeve – he is so clearly
young and afraid that you
can’t help but feel for him.
Mahon, though, takes this
performance to another
level entirely. On the
surface, Mikey is aggres-
sive and violent, easily
picking fights; however,
as the play progresses,
Mahon peels back the
layers of violence to
reveal the tender and
afraid young man hiding
beneath.
The vulnerability
of both young men is
perfectly captured in a
moment where Mikey
asks Casey what he sees
in him. Casey struggles
to convey his feelings,
simply stating that what
he likes is “just…you”
. When questioned by
Mikey, who in turn can’t
bring himself to accept
this unconditional affec-
tion, is convinced it must
be his looks, or what he
can do for Casey.
Georgia de Grey’s
rooftop set is simple, but
effective. Its role here is
to allow the actors to own
the stage. The intimate
setting of The Vaults is
perfect for this production
and it really benefits
from the proximity to
the audience. Director
Thomas Martin clearly
John Donovan’s debut play about identity is a triumph.
Alan Mahon and Josh Williams are brilliant as the gay couple Mikey and Casey // Keith Dixon

IF I WE GOT SOME MORE
COCAINE I COULD SHOW
YOU HOW I LOVE YOU
“Within
the space
of a single
conversation,
Donovan
manages to
capture the
complexity of
entire lives”
has a great understanding
of Donovan’s work and
beautifully captures the
intensity of the relation-
ship between the two men.
Despite the play being
a single scene for one
hour, it never feels tired
or boring. The real star
of the show, however, is
undoubtedly playwright
John Donovan. It’s hard
to believe this play is
his debut work and it’s
beyond clear that his
IARA award for best new
playwright was clearly
deserved. Somehow,
within the space of an hour
and a single conversation,
he manages to capture the
complexity of entire lives.
If we got some more
cocaine I could show
you how I love you is
independent theatre at its
best. The Vault Festival is
the perfect place for this
play and it is more than at
home in a programme full
of stellar productions and
innovative storytelling.
It’s a pity that its run at
Vault is so short because
this play is one that really
deserves to be seen.
