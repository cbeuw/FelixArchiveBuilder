Day Six: Stage Five
A
day behind our
schedule due
to the storm on
day four, we
began hiking at 6:30am
just as the sun was rising.
The first two hours were
relentless climbing in
70mph winds that kept
blowing us over. At the
top, the wind was so strong
that we could lean our
whole body weight into it
without falling over! We
kept our sheltered break
short, before starting the
long but gentle descent
to the end of stage five,
arriving just after midday.
It was far easier under-
foot than in the previous
stages, but even so it was
15km, and by the end of
the stage we were split as
to whether we should do
a double stage to get back
on schedule and escape
the 80 Belgian paratroop-
ers that were hiking the
same trail and crowding
the pristine wilderness.
Concluding that it was
more important to finish
trekking for the day than
out-hike the paratroopers,
Carla and Diane stayed
with the boys and enjoyed
a relaxing afternoon of
wine, beer, and tuna pasta
with our hiking friends
Alexandra and Mandus.
Meanwhile, Max pressed
on to the next stage alone,
escaping the testosterone
of 80 commandos, who
were singing their in-
timidating chants “SEX,
DRUGS, GUNS, AND
DANGER – THAT’S
THE LIFE OF THE
AIRBORNE RANGE”
during the night, only to
hear us reply with our
RSM ones: “WE ARE
MINERS!”
Day Seven: Stage Six
Without our leader to
guide us, we opted for a
more laid back 9am start
for stage six, knowing
it was one of the easier
stages. After a late night
in the hotel bar saying
goodbye to Victor and Lila
(some hiking friends who
were ending their GR20
experience), we were glad
for a lie-in that morning
– especially Harry who
may have had one too
many beers! One benefit
of the army men taking
over the camp was the
boxes of free ration pack
snacks they left behind
for anyone to help them-
selves. We got a bit carried
away with the concept of
free food (the refuge food
was very expensive – I’m
talking €6 for four slices
of ham expensive!) and
we started the day with
packs multiple kilograms
heavier!
The gentle climb and
descent to Lac Du Ninu
presented no problems.
We had a paddle in a pain-
fully cold lake and many
breaks throughout the
day, thoroughly enjoying
the Corsican landscape
instead of having to glue
our eyes to the tricky
terrain at our feet. We also

Day Eight: Stage Sev-
en & Eight-B
Having appointed
Carla the new team leader
the night before, everyone
was soon to regret that
decision when we were
awoken by a 2.30am
alarm for a 4am start up
the mountain – all because
a French man told us that
the highest point of that
day provided a view of the
best sunrise in Corsica….
We were not disap-
pointed. After two hours
of relentless scrambling,
we reached the summit
at 6am while it was
still dark, and a dim red
glow was visible on the
horizon. Also, joining us
on our twilight climb was
a dog that guided us all
the way up – whenever
we got lost, we could see
his eyes glowing red and
we knew where the right
way was! We called him
Max to complete the team
once again. As the sun
began to rise, we wriggled
back into the comfort and
warmth of our sleeping
bags and enjoyed the
landscape before us,
relishing the fact that
the hard work was over
and everyone back at the
refuge would have only
just begun to stir. It was
one of the best moments
of our GR20 expedition.
We spent an hour taking
photos and listening to
Hans Zimmer’s Inception
in our sleeping bags
before emerging back into
the chilly morning air to
begin traversing along the
arete.
There were some
awkward slabs, boulders,
gullies, and short
scrambles to negotiate,
including a very steeply
inclined slab with chains
underneath a boulder
that practically required
sliding down on our bums.
At this point, Harry sped
ahead down to the refuge
because he was desper-
ate for a poo, and upon
arrival was disappointed
that the toilets were holes
in the ground to squat
over. Meanwhile, Diane,
Georgios, and Carla took
advantage of the head
start on the other hikers

hours of descent that were
the hardest – we had been
walking for 13 hours and
had covered thousands
of metres of ascent and
descent by the time we
arrived so our feet were
sore from the constant
impact on the rock. Upon
arrival, we found Max
(the person as well as the
dog!), and Diane thor-
oughly spoilt the dog with
left-overs from her dinner.
In fact, she became way
too attached to the dog,
and Carla was surprised to
find her bed occupied by
him when she came back
from dinner in the refuge!
He was swiftly kicked
out and spent the night
sleeping in the tent outer
instead.
Day Nine: Stage
Nine-A
Having started at 4am
the day before, we relaxed
the start time by five hours
and set off at 9am. Since
Max didn’t have such a
long day previously, he
was off before we woke
up, negotiating stage
nine – the last stage of the
northern part of the GR20.
Much to our dismay, the
dog was also nowhere
to be seen, despite us
treating him so well the
night before! We had a
few hours of steep ascent
followed by a long but
mainly gradual descent.
Getting up to the peak
was tricky and involved
some scrambling. Even in
places that didn’t require
scrambling, we found
the steep incline very
tiring after the previous
double-stage. On the
way down, we found a
waterfall with a deep pool
underneath so we took
off our boots and took
the plunge – many times
in Carla’s case. We then
proceeded to sunbathe for
an hour or so, and when
Harry eventually suggest-
ed moving on, Georgios
and Diane responded
rather unenthusiastically
as they lay back down to
sunbathe! We also came
across a British couple
just before we left, and
Harry tried to lecture
them about the Geology
of Corsica – I don’t think
they were quite as enthu-
siastic as him!
The last part of the
day was nearly luxury
for the GR20 – an almost
paved path leading down
to Vizzavona where the
guidebook had promised
us a pizzeria. There was
indeed a pizzeria but,
much to our horror, we
were told their pizza oven
had broken! Nevertheless,
we treated ourselves to a
meal in the restaurant with
Alex, Mandus, and Max.
Day Ten: Stage Ten
We were planning to
leave at 9am that morning
but it was 9:30am by
the time Georgios and
Harry had finally put
their tent down. It didn’t
matter though because
the day’s route was easy,
and we covered ground
very quickly. We could
already see the difference
between the terrain in the
south compared to the
north. From one of the
highest points reached
that day, the Aiguilles de
Bavella were visible in the
distance – pointy peaks of
the penultimate day on
the trail and a reminder
that we were closing in
on Conca. Most of the
day consisted of walking
through a forest, with
much shallower inclines
than we were used to. In
fact, the terrain was so
much flatter than on the
previous days that we
passed the time by singing
musicals, ABBA, Queen,
and Eminem. There was
a particularly good spot
on a rock overlooking a
forested hilly landscape,
where we took a break
and Harry sang ‘The Hills
are Alive’. That night was
very windy and the door
of the boys’ tent inverted
in the wind, leaving them
with little sleep.
