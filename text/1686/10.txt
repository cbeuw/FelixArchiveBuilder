Frontiers in Traumatic Brain Injury 2018
F
ollowing the
success of the in-
augural Frontiers
in TBI (FITBI)
conference in 2017, we
welcome you to the 2nd
FITBI conference this
July at Imperial College
London.
A two-day programme
of talks, debates, and
poster sessions that will
cover scientific advances
into the fundamental
understanding of trau-
matic brain injury and its
clinical management.
The conference has a
broad scope and will be
of interest to a range of
scientific and clinical dis-
ciplines working within
TBI. There will be a pro-
gramme of invited talks
from early stage research-
ers, as well as a faculty of
internationally renowned
scientists. Topics covered
in this year’s conference
will include:
• Neurodegenera-
tion and TBI: Prof. John
Hardy
• Advances in neu-
roimaging: Prof. David
Sharp
•Sports and military
TBI
• Paediatric TBI
This year we are intro-
ducing a podium poster
presentation session
for a selection of the
top submissions for the
conference. Quick-fire
presentations (~5min)
will allow a wide range
of submitted work to be
highlighted. This is an
excellent opportunity for
early career researchers
to showcase their latest
work.
FITBI 2017 included
two lively interactive
debates (available online
https://goo.gl/Th4qr8).
Mark Wilson & Ian
Walker debated whether
cycling helmets should be
compulsory. David Sharp
& Lee Goldstein clashed
over whether ‘concussion’
is a term best consigned to
retirement.Thesewasvery
entertaining and similar
debates will be included
in this programme.
This will be a dynamic
and intimate conference,
small enough to facilitate
networking and the for-
mation of new collabora-
tions. Abstract submission
for the poster competition
and Early Bird registra-
tion will be open until the
26th
of May (£180/£130
students/trainees).

Smells like Quantum?
Can physics provide a solution to an age-old biological question?

n recent years, sci-
ence has given us
incredible insights
into the way our
universe works: we have
sequenced the entire
human genome, broken
matter into the most
fundamental building
blocks, and looked back
to the seconds following
the Big Bang. You might
think that by now we
would have answered
simple questions such as
‘how exactly does smell
function?’; however, you
may be surprised to know
that academics are still
unsure as to the precise
mechanics of one of our
five basic senses.
This problem is
slightly more complex
than you might think. A
simple view one might
have would be that when
smelling a substance, a
chemical reaction of some
sort may occur, whose
products in some way
triggers a neurological
response.
Consider limonene:
(S)-limonene smells of
lemon, while its mirror
image (R)-limonene
smells of oranges. Conse-
quently, researchers began
to investigate, and this led
to the development of the
“lock-and-key” hypoth-
esis, which states if the
receptors are presumed
to work as locks, only a
complementary key (or
odorant molecule) of
exact shape would bind
and trigger a response.
This sheds some light
to the above example. The
two mirror images (also
known as “enantiomers”)
of limonene have slightly
different shapes and so
will bind to different
receptors, and thus will
smell differently. Fans of
murder mysteries may be
able to spot a fundamen-
tal flaw in this theory.
Using the example of
cyanide (which has a very
characteristic almond
smell due to the chemical
benzaldehyde), the two
enantiomers of this mol-
ecules have very different
shapes yet smell almost
identical. Furthermore,
there is also the issue of
the fact that the sense of
smell is incredibly selec-
tive, as indicated by the
orange-lemon example.
“A number
of examples
show the lock-
and-key model
is not correct
for our sense
of smell”
The proteins in our
nose, however, are prone
to ‘non-specific binding’
such that if the key is not
a direct fit, binding would
still occur. In a recent
investigation, bees were
able to tell the difference
between two versions of
the same molecule, with
deuterium substituted for
hydrogen in one of the
odorants.
Hereafter, physical
chemists decided to take
on this problem. This
question is one of many
in recent years where
scientists have turned to
quantum mechanics to
explain a peculiar process.
In this case, the suggested
culprit was ‘quantum
tunnelling’ which forms
the basis of what is known
as ‘the vibrational theory
of olfaction.’
The theory indicates
that the way in which we
classify odorants is by
their chemical bonds. For
instance, molecules con-
taining hydrogen-sulphur
bonds all seem to smell of
rotten eggs, irrespective
of their shape.
The model states that
upon smelling, electrons
pass between energy
levels in neighbouring
atoms within our scent
receptors, thus stimulat-
ing signals that are sent
to our brains. The energy
difference between these
levels is greater than the
energy that the electron
possesses itself.
Classically, these
transitions would be pro-
hibited, but in quantum
mechanics there is a
probability that electrons
can make these seemingly
impossible jumps. This
is made possible by a
process known as ‘inelas-
tic quantum tunnelling’.
In order for this to
take place, the electron
must offload a precise
amount of energy, which
is only possible if there
is something there to
absorb the energy, such
as a molecular bond. Tun-
nelling will only occur if
the vibrational frequency
of the molecular bond is
exactly the right value to
absorb the electron’s of-
floaded energy. We there-
fore have a mechanism
through which our noses
can distinguish different
smells by their bonding,
rather than their shape.
The problem, it seems has
been solved.
Not so fast! We have
already seen that our noses
can differentiate between
enantiomers of the same
molecule, but the vibra-
tional theory in no way
accounts for this. Thus,
the model might be a bit
more complicated than
first thought. Some have
suggested that in ‘com-
bination modes’ where
the molecule not only
vibrates but also twists,
tunnelling properties may
vary sufficiently between
enantiomers enabling
them to be distinguished..
Unfortunately, it has
been found that this
process only works for
a handful of molecules,
as electron tunnelling
is heavily dependent on
pressure and temperature.
Higher pressures result in
the molecules ceasing vi-
bration, as they constantly
collide with other mole-
cules. This implies that
beyond a certain pressure
we should stop being able
to smell.
The two competing
theories appear to have
reached a standstill in
their ability to explain this
everyday phenomenon.
due to the process it is
thought to be analogous
to, which is exactly how
credit card machines
operates.
Firstly, the card must
be the correct thickness
to physically fit in the
machine and secondly, the
information encoded on
the card is electromagnet-
ically read. The process
may be similar in olfac-
tion whereby the odorant
is first identified by its
shape, by binding to a
complementarily-shaped
receptor, and then is
classified by its chemistry
through electron tunnel-
ling.
Thistheorystillrequires
much work; however,
many individuals in the
field are convinced that
we are on the brink of
finally being able to truly
understand one of the
key facets of the human
sensory experience!
It seems that the realm
of physics, much derided
for its lack of applicability
in the modern world may
yet offer answers to the
most real-life of questions.
“The two
competing
theories
have been
combined into
the‘swipe-
card’model”
One solution to this
is obvious – combine
both theories into one.
The ‘swipe-card’ model
has recently risen in
popularity to become the
leading hypothesis for the
true nature of smell. It is
thought that an odorant
encodes information
about its smell in both
its shape and molecular
bonds.
The model is so-called
