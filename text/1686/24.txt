ubble waffles,
also known as
egg waffles,
have recently
risen from relative ob-
scurity to become the
next online sensation. An
import from Hong Kong,
egg waffles originated as
a street snack in the 1950s
and are made with a sweet
egg-rich batter cooked on
a special frying pan with
small round cells.
traditional ice cream cone
to become the next hip
dessert. By curling the
bubble waffle and placing
it in a cardboard holder, a
good-sized scoop of ice
cream and plenty of pho-
togenic delicious toppings
can neatly fit. As well as
impressing passers-by,
creating beautiful food
is essential to stimulate
a buzz online and attract
hungry customers, with

next snap.
Having been bom-
barded by pictures of
this upgraded ice cream,
I decided I ought to try a
bubble waffle and see if it
tasted as good as it looked.
First Impressions
As there are a number
of outlets selling bubble
waffles it was relatively
easy to source a location
for my taste-test, so I
decided on venturing
to foodies’ paradise,
Boxpark in Shoreditch.
Located in “Unit 58” was
Nosteagia, a self-pro-
fessed bubble waffle spe-
cialist, featured in Secret
London. Naturally, as
Unit 58 is essentially just
a booth, there is not much
to remark about the actual
venue, but the menu board
above the counter did
impress me with its range
of flavours (for both the
waffle and ice cream) and
exciting toppings.
The Food
After spending a good
few minutes debating
which flavours and
toppings to pick, I decided
to stick with a relatively
simple combination:
original bubble waffle,
matcha ice cream, blue-
berries, and Nutella.
As the waffle is made
on order it was really in-
teresting to see the batter
being poured into the
round cells on the special
frying pan. My bubble
waffle was assembled
carefully, with blue-
berries being delicately
arranged and Nutella
artistically drizzled. It
certainly looked appetis-
ing! However, in reality
the dessert itself is not
particularly practical, and
I began to worry how I
was actually going to eat
it. Thankfully a spoon
was provided to attack the
rather oversized dessert,
and I eagerly dipped into
the ice cream and its
toppings.
and took a rather awkward
bite of the bubble waffle.
The outside of the waffle
had a crunchy sweetness
while the inside was light
and fluffy, but disappoint-
ingly the waffle did not
have that much flavour
overall. When I finally
managed to combine the
waffle with the ice cream
it was rather pleasant and
refreshing as it was not
too sweet. Nevertheless,
it definitely looked better
than it tasted.

version of ice cream or just a pointless online-fad.

Worth the hype?
No. Bubble waffles are an online sensation
due to their photogenic arrangements and endless
topping combinations. However, in reality it is a
rather awkward dessert with nothing particularly
special (at least flavour-wise) about it.
