The first
big event of
the athletics
season was upon us. Our
thirteen-strong team of
elite athletes jetted off
to the Northern lands of
Sheffield for a full week-
end of cheering, racing,
and, of course, dancing
the night away. Held at the
English Institute of Sport,
the championships offers
a chance for university
athletes from across the
country to kick-start their
season and get a sense of
where they’re at before
the year ahead.
After a harrowing train
journey full of cancelled
reservations and rammed
corridors, we eventually
reached our destination,
with some members of
the club already on the
track and competing less
than an hour after arrival
(#hardcore). Given that
I had no events on the
Friday, I just made for a
glorified cheer-squad, so
spent my day cheering on
Marta in the 60m hurdles,
Kate and Sarah in the
women’s 800m and James
and Jonathan in the men’s
800m. The first day of
the competition primarily
consisted of heats, where
athletes competed to
“A special
shout out to
Sarah Johnson
for making the
3000m final
and Sarah
Abrams who
made the long
jump final”
“Watching the
other athletes
leaping
gracefully
over ridiculous
heights with
ease was
pretty damn
inspirational”
qualify for the semi-finals
or final of their event.
To finish the day, we
set off to check into what
turned out to be a top-qual-
ity hostel (thankfully ath-
letics’ captain Max Thorp
has good taste) and for an
evening cooking together
as a team. Led ably by
Hyde Park Relays organ-
iser Kate Olding, we went
on to produce a military
amount of amazing car-
bonara (and it was proper
carbonara too). With
much of the team com-
peting the following day,
we then turned in early to
get ready for the big day
ahead.
On to Saturday we went
– the busiest day of the
competition, with many of
our members competing
(myself included). On the
way to the stadium, I dis-
covered all of the events
would be filmed and
streamed online, which
personally I found hilari-
ous given what a beginner
to the sport I am. As long
as none of my family
could find the stream, I
was safe. Men’s Captain
Lewis Jackson turned out
an excellent performance
in the men’s 1500m,
as did Kate Olding and
Sarah Grover, who had
both progressed to the
semi-finals of the 800m.
A special mention too for
Women’s Captain Anna
Lawson who delivered a
PB in the 1500m, as well
as Stephanie Hewitt and
Oliver Newton for their
performances in their
3000m heats. Last, but not
least, we had ex-Athletics’
Captain Raul Rinken
throwing strong in the
shot-put. It would be
fair to say I hardly set the
world on fire in the high
jump, but the chance to
experience competition
at such a level and watch
the other athletes leaping
gracefully over ridiculous
heights with ease was
pretty damn inspirational
(I’m talking over 2 metres
here…).
After cheering on the
rest of the team until the
late afternoon, the day
drew to a close. Having
decided we had all earned
it, we set off in matching
ICXCAC tie-dye t-shirts
for the finest Chinese all-
you-can-eat that Sheffield
had to offer. Following
on from this, the half of
the team that had finished
competing went off
into the night to sample
the renowned Sheffield
nightlife. They were not
disappointed, if their
appearance the following
morning was anything to
go by.
And then it was
Sunday: finals day. Or in
my case, the start of the
200m heats. No one could
manage to explain to me
why the entirety of the
200m competition was
being run all in one day,
final and Sarah Abrams
who made the long jump
final! They did not dis-
appoint. One of the best
things about going to this
event was that not only
did you get the chance
to compete, but you got
to sit and watch some of
the best athletes in the
country battling it out in
real time (for free!). Much
drama followed, from
shock disqualifications, to
last minute dives over the
line to take the gold. What
more could you ask for?
All in all, an amazing
event to take part in! If
you’ve not worked it out
yet, I’m completely new
to athletics, but I can
honestly say getting out
of your comfort zone and
giving it a go is not some-
thing you’ll regret. So
if you fancy yourself as
the next Usain Bolt, or if
you just want to try it out,
come along to one of our
many athletics sessions!

mation, you can contact

but if I’m honest, it was
never likely to affect me
anyway. I finished an hon-
ourable sixth of six in my
heat, but who can argue
with a new PB? Once my
heat was done, I joined the
rest of ICXCAC to watch
the finals – a special shout
out here to Sarah Johnson
for making the 3000m
DOUBLES SQUASH, IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE!?

squash hosted
our Inaugural
Doubles Open at Ethos,
with teams hailing from
our own club, Imperial
alumni, students from
all the various London
universities, and doubles
enthusiasts enticed via
social media.
The tournament started
on Saturday morning
and featured three fields:
Grade A, Grade B, and
Mixed. Much to the
delight of some players,
a livestream on social
media offered the op-
portunity to witness the
early matches without
disruption to their sacred
morning routines. Starting
off in group stages, the
pairs showcased not only
their technique but also
their ability to adapt to the
traditional English ruling
(11 points, best of three),
which caused for some
confusion about who had
to serve. The first day of
the tournament ended with
curly fries in the union,
evoking happy memories
of years gone by for the
numerous alumni attend-
ing the tournament.
The Mixed Final kicked
things off on Sunday with
the pair Victoria Leow/
Alex Li (LSE) seeing off
IC’s former men’s No1 Ian
Jubb playing together with
Carrie Elliott (women’s
2nd team captain) in two
clear games. The women’s
final went the full distance
and LSE’s pair Clara Ng /
Alexa Tzarnas (LSE) tri-
umphed over Melissa Lee
(LSE)/Pamela Hathway
(IC). Germany’s former
national player stayed on
court for another final,
when she was joined by
Patrick Brandl (IC men’s
1st
team) to compete in the
Grade A final. Hathway/
“Doubles
can be a lot
more fun than
singles and is,
arguably, more
multifaceted”
Brandl proved that not
only can a mixed team
play in Grade A, but they
can even make quite an
impression – they hadn’t
dropped a single game
on their journey to the
final. They faced the
tournament favourites,
Marco Alves / Puvendren
Subramaniam (IC men’s
1st
team) who were also
yet to drop a game.
Much to the delight
of the spectators and
online-viewers, the match
turned out to be a close
one, with both pairs being
tested by long rallies (we
even saw the odd dive to
retrieve some balls). Un-
surprisingly in a doubles
match on a singles court,
the referee got involved,
and the players welcomed
the opportunity for a
friendly debate with
him. Hathway/Brandl
adapted their strategy to
the shot-making of Sub-
ramaniam and the clean
hitting of Alves, which
forced lengthy and deep
exchanges on the hot and
humid courts at Ethos.
In the end, Alves/ Sub-
ramaniam were able to
exert their authority, and
Hathway/Brandl had to
settle for the consolation
prize of being the only
pairing to claim a game
off them all tournament.
We wanted the tour-
nament to provide a
competitive inter-univer-
sity doubles competition,
otherwise lacking in the
BUCS setup, but also
to serve as a means for
players from different
universities and different
and Badminton, where
doubles is an integral part
ofBUCSmatches,doubles
squash is not played as
part of the league, or as a
standalone event. Singles
squash seems to over-
shadow its high paced
and ultra-tactical doubles
cousin. There is also the
common misconception
that it is not possible to
play doubles on a regular
singles court. There are
indeed specialised, wider
courts, but these are few
and far between in the
UK, and you are unlikely
to find one down at your
local club. But it most
certainly is possible to
play doubles on a singles
court – in fact, it makes
it all the more tactical as
you try to outmanoeuvre
your opponent and find
space where there is not
much to be found.
Doubles can be a lot
more fun than singles
and is, arguably, more
multifaceted. The game
is much less about heavy
hitting and fast running,
and more akin to a chess
battle with your opponent,
thinking several moves
ahead about how you
are going to move them
around the court, as well
as how you are going to
use your partner for that
killer blow to win a rally.
Whereas singles is mostly
won on fitness and power,
doubles is won with the
mind. The result being
that a victory can feel as
satisfying as completing
the Felix crossword.
The winners of each
field walked away with

each taking home a racket
bag. IC Squash would like
to thank Blade Squash
for sponsoring our prizes,
members of the commit-
tee for helping to run and
promote the tournament,
Ethos for providing the
squash courts for two full
days, and all participants
for making it a fantastic,
competitive and, most im-
portantly, highly sociable
event. We hope to see you
at next year’s edition, but
if you cannot wait that
long, why not drop by the
squash courts sometime
to meet some of our club
members? We would love
to help you get into this
exciting sport! Email us
