Lady Bird: Love and cinema in Sacramento
D
on’t you think
maybe they
are the same
thing? Love
and attention?”
Christine “Lady Bird”
McPherson (Saoirse
Ronan) is in her last
year of high school, at
a catholic institution in
the city of Sacramento,
California. Her dream,
like innumerable other
teens across the states of
America, is to get as far
away from her surround-
ings as possible; a liberal
arts college on the East
Coast would offer her just
the escape she is seeking.
Taking place across
Senior Year in the early
2000s, we see Lady
Bird pick up and drop
boyfriends, best friends,
houses, pastimes, and
names, as she tries to
figure out her place in
the world. What remains
constant, however, is
her relationship with her
mother Marion (Laurie
exemplifies what often
occurs between parents
and late adolescents, who
are itching to leave the
family nest.
Gerwig cut her teeth in
the world of screenwriting
with mumblecore films
and collaborations with
Noah Baumbach, such
as Mistress America and
Frances Ha. But while
those previous films
relied on a breezy, screw-
ball-esque energy associ-
ated with their New York
settings, in Lady Bird
Gerwig has opted for a
more naturalistic, relaxed
tone; it’s more intimate,
more nuanced, and – dare
I say it – more enjoyable
than her previous work.
It can be difficult, when
watching Lady Bird, to
remember that this is
Gerwig’s first turn alone
in the director’s chair.
Her direction is calm and
assured, and you could
easily be watching the
work of someone at the
height of their creative
powers, rather than
somebody just starting
out on what is hopefully a
lengthy directorial career.
She handles complex
topics with a gentle grace
and even-handedness,
which belies the emotion-
al power of the film as a
whole.
One of the most im-
pressive aspects of the
film is how it deals with
the city of Sacramento,
where Gerwig was born
and brought up. While
the setting of Lady Bird
certainly impacts on the
nature of the film, Gerwig
never allows the time or
place to overshadow the
narrative. References to
theearlynoughtiesabound
in the film, but always
indirectly – Gerwig builds
up her own image of
Sacramento through small
details, and the result is a
sense of setting that gets
deep into the viewer’s
bones. Lady Bird shows
us how where we grow up
never really leaves us, for
better or worse, and that
an appreciation for our
home towns often appears
after we’ve left to greener
pastures.
What Lady Bird
skewers particularly well,
in my opinion, is the
experience of growing up
as a member of the strug-
gling American working
class, and the feelings
of inferiority such an
upbringing generates
in Lady Bird when she
compares herself to her
more well-off classmates.
While Lady Bird’s family
are by no means living in
poverty, the film bombards
us with plot elements –
shopping in thrift shops,
socks at Christmas – that
highlight both the mo-
mentous impact an East
Coast college placement
could have on Lady Bird’s
finances, and the distances
her parents will go to keep
the family’s head above
water.
It is this knowledge
that makes Lady Bird’s
rejection of what her
upbringing offers that
much more impactful.
Of course, she is at an
age when it is normal
to reject what you’re
offered by your parents,
but what Lady Bird does
exceptionally well is to
show us the effects such
rejection can have. When
Lady Bird refers to her
house as being ‘on the
wrong side of the tracks’,
for example, it cuts deep
to a mother who never
expected to be raising two
kids there.
Lady Bird could easily
be just another coming-of-
age drama, in which the
protagonist leaves behind
her small-town upbringing
for bright lights in the city;
but thanks to Gerwig’s
brilliant direction and
well-crafted script, Lady
Bird manages to be much
more than that. Gerwig
has managed to find the
beauty in Sacramento, in
the agony of adolescence,
in teenage heartbreak, in
disappointing sex, in the
ingratitude of children, in
letting your parents down,
in trying to be the best
you can be, even if it’s not
good enough for others.
It’s film-making that
requires a lot of attention.
And, yes – it feels like
love.
Greta Gerwig’s debut turn in the director’s chair reveals a phenomenal talent, in this tale exploring the bonds
between parents and children.

LADY BIRD
Guillermo del Toro shows us the shape of his dreams
in this fantasy romance
In The Shape of Water, Guillermo del Toro has created a complete fantasy world, in which the viewer is able to
completely immerse themselves.
D
i s o b e d i e n c e
is one of the
s t r o n g e s t
signals of your
conscience of what is
right and what is wrong”
said Guillermo del Toro
when promoting his mas-
terpiece Pan’s Labyrinth,
“when you disobey in
an intelligent way, you
disobey in a natural way,
it turns out to be more
beneficial than blind obe-
dience. Blind obedience
castrates, negates, hides,
and destroys what makes
us human.”
More than a decade on
from the film that made
his name in the world of
cinema, he returns to the
same themes – those of
choice, duality, and the
battle between natural
chaos and artificial order
– in The Shape of Water,
a beautiful, twisted fairy-
tale for our own age.
As usual with his
films, del Toro asks us to
suspend right from the
off any sense of disbelief
that may cling to us as we
settle in our seats. Starting
with a sequence in which
the camera floats weight-
less through an apartment
building flooded with
water, The Shape of Water
is a sensory experience
“As in his
previous films,
any notion
of whimsy is
undercut by an
ever-present
sense of
violence”
like no other; throughout
the two-hour runtime, del
Toro bombards us with
images and scenes of such
beauty and intensity that
to leave the cinema seems
like an affront, since it
necessitates breaking the
delicate spell the film
weaves.
As with Pan’s Lab-
yrinth, set in Franco’s
Spain, The Shape of Water
is a film shaped by a strong
sense of time and place:
in this film the location is
Baltimore, and the year
is 1962. The Cold War
is at its full height, racial
discrimination is rife,
and a mute woman called
Eliza (Sally Hawkins)
works as a cleaner at a
top secret government
facility. Her regular order
is one day disrupted,
when a new acquisition
is brought into the labora-
tory by a glowering army
colonel called Strickland
(Michael Shannon) – it’s
an amphibious humanoid,
obtained from South
America, where it was
worshiped as a god, and
played with beautiful
physicality by regular del
Toro collaborator Doug
Jones.
From the off, Eliza
is captivated with the
creature; she begins a
silent courtship, teaching
him sign language and
introducing him to the
music of Benny Goodman
in a series of wonderful-
ly-crafted scenes. But, of
course, this cannot last.
With hopes the creature
could give them the edge
needed to succeed in the
Space Race, the govern-
ment orders his vivisec-
tion, and Eliza is forced
to break him out – with
the help of her closeted
neighbour Giles (Richard
Jenkins), Soviet spy Dr.
Hoffstetler (Michael
Stuhlbarg), and Afri-
can-American co-worker
Zelda (Octavia Spencer).
es the action. Del Toro
is a director who knows
that desire and lust are but
two aspects of the same
object, and this allows
him to keep his characters
from floating away on a
sense of whimsy.
While there is ample
acting talent in the sup-
porting cast – Jenkins is
particularly excellent in
his role, all simmering
anxiety and concealed
tensions – the emotional
centre of the film is
Hawkins, whose perfor-
mance as Eliza captivates.
Unable to speak, she
conveys her thoughts
and feelings with subtle
changes to facial expres-
sions and body language
– a hard-won achievement
that she makes look effort-
less. Her Eliza manages
to be both free-floating
and grounded, going
from scenes where she
joyfully dances around
the amphibian’s tank, to
confronting Giles with
sign language so pointed
it revels her immense rage
with perfect ease.
The Shape of Water is,
ultimately, a film in thrall
to the power of cinema,
and the delicate but potent
beauty it can create. Del
Toro is clearly a director
who is so obviously in
love, both with his own
creations, and those that
came before him; The
Shape of Water is indebted
to both classic musical
numbers of movies gone
by and schlocky Univer-
sal Monsters from the
B-movie era.
It’s not a perfect film,
by any means: some of
the plot elements don’t
quite gel together, with
some side-elements
seeming superfluous; and
the links del Toro draws
between sexuality, race,
and disability can seem
ham-fisted. But ultimate-
ly, The Shape of Water
is best enjoyed with the
sense of weightlessness
that comes through
suspension of over-anal-
ysis; it’s a hand-crafted
fantasy-world, build by
a director who is at the
height of his powers, both
in terms of creativity and
scale. To interrogate it
too deeply would destroy
its magic; it would be a
shame.
“Seems like I was both
both too early or too late
for my life,” reflects Giles
at one point – an illus-
trator living in a time of
photography; a gay man
existing during a period
of hate. Luckily, for us,
this film has arrived at
the precise right moment:
The Shape of Water is del
Toro’s world, and you
should take the time to
live in it, even for a little
while.
