London Anime & Gaming Con 2018
Games Editor Saad Ahmed gives their two cents on the recent Anime and Gaming Con and of conventions in
general.
C
onventions, be
it Comic Con
or last week-
end’s Anime
and Gaming Con, are
usually the kind of thing
where only a small group
of people really know
what they’re all about.
Most people either don’t
know they exist or are
hesitant to go out of fear
or uncertainty about what
it actually is and what it
might involve. From my
brief time at this week-
end’s convention, I’ll give
you my quick rundown of
the event and comment a
bit about conventions in
general.
The convention was
held at a small complex
owned by London Met-
ropolitan University,
taking place over two
main floors. The lower
floor was more dimly
lit à la a nightclub with
a small stage, a bar and
a few stalls with games
and handicraft products
on sale. There were also
some back rooms were
people could go and chill
out. One such room had a
collection of retro gaming
rigs set up with consoles
such as the Nintendo 64,
the SEGA Genesis and
the PlayStation 2 (feel old
yet?).
The upper room was
larger, with a bigger stage,
more seats and a larger
variety of stalls with an
even larger collection of
colourful merchandise on
sale. I’d honestly say it’s
worth going, just to buy
“The explosion
of geek culture
is a bit jarring
at first, but it’s
something you
warm up to”
“Rick trying to
sell his portal
gun to DC’s
Deathstroke is
just amazing
to watch”
some cool artwork, shirts
and trinkets. However,
we’re all on a student
budget here so make sure
you watch your wallet
when you venture forth.
Compared to MCMC
Comic Con held in May
and October, this one
was smaller in scope
and number of people.
However, I personally
thought that this worked
out in its favour; it was
nice to get a change of
pace from a more grandeur
event. For example, when
the karaoke event took
place, it felt like around
half the attendees were
present. I know the more
socially awkward of you
readers will freak out
at this but honestly, it
made the event feel more
like an intimate affair. It
seemed like it was geared
towards being more social
and interactive with other
guests, another thing
which you awkward peeps
may object to.
One thing that’s note-
worthy in any convention
is the sheer amount of
geekiness you’re exposed
to. Seeing the explosion
of geek culture is a bit
jarring at first, but it’s
something you warm up
to. It’s endearing to see so
many people, passionate
about their interests and
hobbies, and generally
being welcoming and
non-judgemental towards
each other. The quality
of cosplay is also a real
joy to watch; as cliché
as it sounds, it’s like the
characters have literally
jumped out of the screens
into real life.
Unfortunately, I had a
busy weekend and was
unable to hang around for
the full three day event,
let alone a full day for
that matter. Had I stuck
around, there would have
been a variety of different
events to take part in and
have some fun with. There
were gaming tournaments
on Saturday and Sunday
over a wide selection of
games like Super Smash
Brothers, Overwatch,
League of Legends and
more. As an incentive to
take part, there were cash
prizes, although to be
fair, you’d probably get
wrecked by someone who
takes the game seriously.
There were also Q&A
sessions with artists and
voice actors, talks about
aspects of gaming and
anime, and an assortment
of different activities.
These included, but were
not limited to, live band
performances, a big
Geek Quiz and a cosplay
auction (with proceeds
going to Epilepsy Action)
A lot of this might
seem a bit daunting and
worrying. If you decide
to attend a convention,
there’s honestly nothing
to worry about it. You
don’t have to take part
in any of the stuff that
happens. Watching from
the sidelines (which I
was forced to do) can
be just as fun and you’ll
get an experience unlike
any other. Rick trying
to sell his portal gun to
DC’s Deathstroke is just
amazing to watch; it is
literally something you’ll
not see anywhere else in
your life. And it’s just one
of the bizarrely awesome
things you’ll get to en-
counter if you attend. It’d
be worth going along with
a couple of friends so you
don’t feel too out of place.
The next conventions are
MCMC on the 25-27th
of May and a second
Anime and Gaming Con
on the 6-8th
of July. And
no, they’re definitely
not paying me to say
this (although if anyone
reading this is willing to
pay me, that’d be great!)
