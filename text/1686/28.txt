long-term financial

mperial College
Union (ICU) this
week announced
plans to restructure
remuneration for sabbat-
ical officers, who will
now be paid in Yoyo
points.
The seven sabbatical
officers – Union President,
four Deputy Presidents,
Felix Editor, and ICSMSU
President – had previ-
ously been paid roughly
£30,000 per annum, but
from next year they will
be receiving 478,000
Yoyo points to use at
Taste Imperial outlets,
amid concerns about the
long-term financial future
of ICU.
Patrick Gingerly,
ICU’s Head of Finance,
Services, and Cashless
Food-Based Mobile Ap-
plications, told Hangman:
“the last couple of years
have seen an explosion
in the number of clubs
and students, meaning
the Union needs to spend
more than ever before to
guarantee the same great
student experience. At the
same time, the long-run-
ning “Bud Light Boycott”
has meant our income has
taken a hit. After a long
and difficult period of
reflection, we decided the
best solution would be to
keep all of our employees,
but pay them in a useless
Currently, it is unclear
whether Yoyo points can
be used to pay rent, elec-
tricity bills, or anything
that’s not on offer at the
Library Cafe. However,
with the amount of Yoyo
points they are due to be
paid, next year’s sabbat-
ical officers would be
able to afford to purchase
seven portions of curly
fries every day FiveSix-

off, the Union’s Deputy
President (Edutainment)
told Hangman: “I think
that this plan sounds
like a great idea. I know
that the Union has had
long-running concerns
over funding for the last
couple of years, and this
sounds like a really fair
way to settle the issue. Of
course, this will in no way
at all affect me, and I’ll
be out of here next year,
but don’t let that change

changes had made them
reconsider running for a
position: “I didn’t have a
graduate job lined up, so I
thought doing a sabbatical
role would be a good way
of getting very well paid
while not doing a huge
amount of work, and
having little real account-
ability. At first the Yoyo
points thing didn’t put
me off, but then I realised
you couldn’t use them at
Fusion. Fuck that.”
Students across campus
had a range of opinions
on the move. Comments
from students Hangman
spoke to included “that’s
way too many Yoyo
points”, “what the fuck’s
a sabb”, and “turn that re-
corder off before I fucking
bottle you.”
“Currently
it is unclear
whether Yoyo
points can be
used to pay

thing useful, like actual
cash.”

can’t be used

that’”

UCU strike plans have
backfired, as students
actually kind of enjoy
having some time
off from lectures and
teaching.

T
he Universities
and College
Union (UCU)
has had to
change their plans for
strike action, after stu-
dents turned out to not
be inconvenienced at
all, and actually really
quite enjoyed having
some time off.
This week was sup-
posed to see the first two
days of 14 total days of
strike action, in a dispute
between UCU and
Universities UK (UUK)
over changes to pension
schemes. However, by
the second day of strike
action, representatives
of Imperial UCU were
forced to change tack,
after plans to disrupt the
student experience didn’t
come to fruition.
“I told my class I was
going to be striking,” one
lecturer told Hangman,
“and they all started
cheering. Some of them
were actually crying tears
of relief. I had a whole
speech planned out about
how difficult this decision
was for me, and how I
was doing it to save the
future of their education,
but they don’t deserve it.
Little shites.”
Hangman spoke to
Hubert Brack, a final year
physics student whose
lecture this Thursday was
cancelled: “I turned up
at 9am for my morning
lecture, feeling all sick
and depressed as usual.
But then they told us lec-
tures were cancelled, and
it was as if a huge weight
had been lifted. I felt free.
I went around Hyde Park,
and just listened to the
sound of birds; I smiled
at the children passing by;
I… I even laughed, for the
first time in four years!
D-Do you… Do you
know how much I missed
laughter?”
As a result of the can-
cellations, Hangman has
heard reports of numerous
students emailing the
Provost to offer more of
their money, and asking
for higher tuition fees.
The UCU, who had
hoped to cause as much
disruption to College as
possible, had to quickly
divert their tactics. “The
traditional approach
has clearly not worked,
for whatever reason,”
said Rosa Klebb, UCU
spokeswoman, “so we
have reverted to Plan
B. From now on we’re
going to be having an
anti-strike. We’re going to
be working overtime, and
just piling on the problem
sheets and coursework.
That way these students
will really have something
to complain about.”
UCU forced to change plans for strike action
This week you’re on the
Union’s elections team,
and you’ve messed up.
Again.
This week you’re mainly
languishing in prison
after getting slightly too
excited at the Baftas and
launching yourself at
Hugh Grant.
This week you’re the
News Editor, and you’ve
got to pretend to be
interested in Theresa
May’s tuition fee reform.
Someone has to.
This week you join the
picket line during the
strikes, thinking it’s about
Fusion’s price rise. By the
time you’ve realised your
mistake you’ve already
been elected branch
representative.
This week your only
source of entertainment is
watching couples break
up in Central Library. You
twisted fuck.
This week you
accidentally send a
confession of love to
Felix instead of your
crush. They think it’s
a comment piece, and
publish it. Lucky nobody
reads the Comment
section, eh?
This week you get too
deep in your feels about
Black Panther, and
end up writing your
materials coursework
on vibranium. You get a
third.
This week you finally get
paid for that UROP you
did over last summer.
Unfortunately you’ve
already taken out a series
of payday loans to pay for
halls, and someone’s been
hired to break both your
kneecaps.
This week the strikes
mean tutorials are
cancelled! Oh, except
yours. Yeah, they’re
definitely still on for you.
Don’t forget to do those
problem sheets.
This week you’re Deputy
President (Clubs and
Socs). You plan to visit
loads of societies, but
underestimate London
traffic, and arrive at
Harlington having missed
every match you came to
watch.
This week you’re the
Horoscopes Writer, and
you can’t figure out
any more ways to jam
Leadership Elections into
your work. It’s just so
fucking boring.
