MGMT: transformed, transfigured, transcendental
Little Dark Age marks the end of the band’s own dark period as they plunge into synthy waters, reinventing
themselves and creating some interesting new music along the way.
I
t is fair to say that
MGMT have had
some trouble rec-
onciling their own
musical vision and their
fans’auditory desires. But
perhaps their new album,
Little Dark Age, is proof
that abstract expression-
ist Barnett Newmann’s
view - that the encounter
between art and audience
can be considered as a
meeting between two sen-
tient beings, where either
one can be changed by
the experience - can hold
true for music as well.
Transposing this notion
onto MGMT’s discogra-
phy, the trajectory of their
creative process and con-
tent of their output begins
to make far greater sense.
This exploration seems
fitting for a band that has
had such a turbulent rela-
tionship with its listeners.
Beginning their careers
as budding musicians
at Wesleyan University,
New Yorkers Andrew
VanWyngarden and Ben
Goldwasser, known
together as MGMT,
started making music as
a side project in college.
Their first few songs, orig-
inally released on the EP
Time to Pretend (though
some would find their
way onto debut album
Oracular Spectacular)
were originally meant to
be a sardonic exercise in
trying to make the most
commercially-sounding
music possible. The only
problem was, against all
their expectations, the
public loved it. Maybe too
much for the pair’s liking.
A record deal with
Columbia followed, but
the public adulation and
countless commercial
deals were more disheart-
ening than encouraging,
for people were taking
their jokes seriously; the
songs that were supposed
to be subverting the status
quo of popular music,
or at least showing its
problems, were actually
the break had been good
for them. The gigs were
exciting, the tide was
beginning to turn, people
were warming to their
new and exciting sound.
Over the course of
their previous albums,
the mood deteriorated as
quickly as the quality of
their sound, resulting in
jolly tunes such as ‘I love
you too, death’ and ‘Your
life is a lie’. But now, their
art seems to have finally
benefited from the in-
creasingly negative public
push back. They acknowl-
edged their dwindling lis-
tenership and decided to
no longer take themselves
so seriously. They enlisted
the help of Ariel Pink and
Conan Moccasin (the
man who Mac Demarco
considers the best guitar
player he knows) for their
new record, whose sound
is a welcome 180 degree
turn from previous efforts.
Kicking off the album
is the absurd ‘She Works
Out Too Much’, a track
with enough groove and
reverb to be at home in
an 80s aerobics video
– spandex and all. But
despite its goofy lyrics
and double-entendres
(working out as a partner
juxtaposed with physi-
cally working out), the
message is pertinent to
society. It tells the story
of a technological gen-
eration that has become
too fickle and superficial,
but it doesn’t do it in a
headache-inducing way
(anyone rememberArcade
fire’s “Love is hard / Sex
is easy” line? Yeah, me
neither), nicely setting the
tone for the album. The
entire thing excellently
toes the line between the
absurd and meaningful,
and by the end, the
common thread through-
out the album is one that
MGMT themselves have
admitted to having lost
for a while after their
debut; they completely
forgot that making music,
like life, was also about
having fun. And so the
lyrics from ‘When you
die’: “And words won’t
do anything / It’s perma-
nently night / And I won’t
feel anything / We’ll all be
laughing with you when
you die” ring especially
true when considering
their creative journey. It
is simultaneously creepy,
funny and moving.
‘Me and Michael’,
a great song as well as
the centre of hilarious
and unexpected colab
with Filipino band True
faith (just check out the
music video), is another
highlight of the album.
It’s about friendship and
sticking together in the
face of adversity. Sadly,
the two songs that follow
are potentially the weakest
on the record. ‘TSLAMP’
(Time Spent Looking At
My Phone), is another
critique of the tech ad-
diction facing modern
society, but besides one
great lyric (“Find me
when the lights go down
/ Signing in, signing out /
Gods descend to take me
home / Find me staring at
my phone”), it is slightly
dull, repetitive, lacking in
any hooks and generally
slows down the album.
‘James’ is another stray
bullet, sounding like
regurgitated Ariel Pink
– except far worse. After
these, the vibe picks up
again, with instrumental
‘Days that got away’
acting as a poignant segue
into the final three songs,
which are capped off with
the delicious, Tame Impa-
la-esque ‘Hand It Over’.
The best song on
the album, though, is
the second title track.
It features a handful of
powerful lines; a wavy,
gothic, synth backdrop; a
drum that packs a punch;
and vocal effects which
only serve to enhance the
feeling of dread conjured
by the lyrics. The song,
just like the album as a
whole, shows that MGMT
have learned much from
their sabbatical, and the
rapidly sold-out London
show tells us that listeners
took notice.

LITTLE DARK AGE
“They

seriously”
blending into it. So they
turned on their own sound.
In fact, they decided that
they would take a detour
off the highway to pop
stardom with their next
LP, 2010’s Congratula-
tions. And, well, if that
was a detour, 2013’s
self-titled album drove the
bus off a cliff.
And off the face of the
earth they disappeared...
A five-year gap in albums
and a two-and-a-half-year
gig hiatus might have
begun to look terminal,
but midway through
2017 they started teasing
material for a new album,
and it became evident that
“The entire
thing
excellently
toes the line
between the
absurd and
meaningful”
Roxy Music’s For Your Pleasure
I
n a time when Elton
John dominated
radio play and sales,
crowds flocked
to catch a glimpse of
David Bowie’s on-stage
theatrics, and the bulk of
underground intelligentsia
attributed artistic merit to
Pink Floyd, it was pretty
hard to break into the
British music scene. No
surprise then, that Roxy
Music are often over-
looked when ruminating
on the golden era of glam.
Formed in 1970, these
art college kids were
always a bit different. Not
content to deliver the big
rock riffs of Led Zeppelin
and Queen, they strove
to establish a new sound,
and a fresh approach to
making music. Frontman
and founder Bryan
Ferry was an old-school
crooner: a silver-tongued,
tuxedo adorning Prince
Charming with an eye
for all things avant-garde.
Joined by a gaggle of
impeccable, yet somehow
unlikely, musicians, their
line-up was beyond solid.
Setting them apart,
however, was none other
than the man with the
Midas Touch, one Brian
Eno, making his first steps
in the world of music.
Often seen sporting heavy
eye makeup, long hair
and a collection of feather
boas, Eno could play no
instruments. He’d had
no formal training and
no songwriting experi-
ence. What he did have,
however, was a brilliant
mind. A mind that saw the
world through a kaleido-
scopic lens, distorting all
that was surely known and
finding clarity in chaos,
something that has paid
Though creative
differences with Ferry
would eventually lead to
Eno’s departure, leaving
can be found shimmer-
ing over their first two
albums, 1972’s Roxy
Music and 1973’s For
Your Pleasure. The latter
is generally considered
to be their magnum opus,
and features some of their
most daring and memora-
ble compositions.
Frenetically swerving
between high-octane
stompers (‘Do The
Strand’, ‘Editions Of
You’, ‘Grey Lagoons’),
smooth groovers (‘Beauty
Queen’, ‘Bogus Man’),
and chilling soundscapes
(‘Strictly Confidential’,
‘For Your Pleasure’),
Roxy display the full
arsenal of their auditory
assault. The pivotal track
is ‘In Every Dream Home
A Heartache’. Backed
with a sinister rock organ
and very little else, Ferry’s
fragile monologue grad-
ually unveils a disturbed
man, deeply apathetic
towards modern society’s
materialistic obsessions.
Opulent but empty, only
one object evades his
disdain: an inflatable doll,
bought mail order. Upon
the uttering of “Inflatable
doll / Lover ungrateful / I
blew up your body / But
you blew my mind”, Phil
Manzanera’s muscular
guitar kicks in with a
spiralling solo, backed
with a thunderstorm of
drums and Eno’s signa-
ture phase-shifting tape
effects.
As the eerie rever-
berations of the album’s
progressive closer fade
out and the heavy clouds
begin to wither, it’s clear
that this is an extraor-
dinary album by a band
way ahead of their time.
Amid the frequent pace
changes and ominous un-
dercurrents, it’s far from
an easy listen, though one
that inspired a host of mu-
sicians. Inexplicable and
at times impenetrable, the
album ends with a fitting
vocal contribution from
Judi Dench: “You don’t
ask / You don’t ask why”
DAMN. Kung Fu Kenny!
I
feel like I’ve spent
the last five months
as Felix Music Editor
almost exclusively
writing about Kendrick
Lamar. Nonetheless,
please indulge me one
more time… I’ll try to
keep it brief. Kendrick
Lamar completed the
UK leg of his DAMN.
world tour last week,
performing six nights and
shutting down arenas in
Birmingham, Manchester,
Glasgow, and London.
The show played out
like a kung fu film, with a
recurring theme of martial
arts running throughout
and the concert beginning
with a short film depicting
“the damn legend of Kung
Fu Kenny”. The night got
off to a frantic start as
Kendrick kicked off his
set with a literal BANG
before launching into
the explosive ‘DNA.’,
complete with a ninja
sharing the stage with
him. This breathless
start to the show set the
pace for the rest of the
evening as Kendrick
proceeded to perform
a medley of up-tempo
fan favourites, including
‘ELEMENT.’ and ‘King
Kunta’. It wasn’t until
after performing his
feature verse on ScHool-
boy Q’s ‘Collard Greens’
that Kendrick gave the
crowd a moment to catch
its breath, before taking
us back with ‘Swimming
Pools (Drank)’ and
‘Backseat Freestyle’
from 2012’s good kid,
m.A.A.d city. The intro to
‘FEEL.’ played out whilst
an accompanying dance
performance took place
on stage as King Kendrick
made his way to perform
‘LUST.’ and ‘Money
Trees’ in an elevated cage
in the centre of the regular
standing section, amongst
his adoring subjects.
Kendrick standing within
spitting distance of me
was arguably the highlight
of my evening and that
moment was only matched
by the a cappella rendition
of ‘HUMBLE.’ as the
concert drew to a close.
There was something
magical about hearing the
20,000-strong crowd echo
back every line from the
track and even Kendrick
seemed touched, pausing
to witness the extent
to which his music has
impacted the culture
and pervaded the mass
consciousness of our
generation.
This was quite simply
the best concert I’ve
attended, worth every
penny of the £80 ticket
price. If his masterstroke
in executive producing
the Black Panther album
weren’t enough proof that
Kendrick is an artist at the
peak of his powers, seeing
him perform live proves
his artistry seemingly
knows no bounds. Not
to sound cliché, but only
one word can describe the
extravaganza Kendrick
put on for us: DAMN.
