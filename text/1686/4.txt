Submitted manifestos
for this year's
Leadership Elections
were made available
for nearly two weeks
due to a computer
error

A
n error in
Imperial Col-
lege Union’s
e l e c t i o n s
webpage meant sub-
mitted manifestos were
available to view for
nearly two weeks.
An incorrect setting
in the eVoting database
meant a discontinued
set of manifesto display
pages, which had been
removed in 2016, were ac-
cidentally reactivated. The
S
trike action by
the University
and College
Union (UCU)
could impact summer
examinations if disputes
over pensions are not
resolved, with a number
of UK universities stat-
ing they will alter their
assessments to reflect
loss of teaching.
Cambridge, York,
and University College
London (UCL) were
among the universi-
ties saying they were
Strike action affects exams
considering removing
questions from examina-
tions if strike action meant
teaching on those subjects
was missed.
UCL told The Times
they would “make every
arrangement possible to
minimise the impact”
of the strikes, but were
prepared to change as-
sessments in the case of
severe disruption.
A number of Imperial
students have exams
scheduled during the
period of the strikes.
However, in last week’s
debate at Union Council
over whether to support
the strikes, Abhijay Sood,
Academics Affair Officer
for the Royal College of
Science Union (RCSU)
said impact on examina-
tions should be negligible,
since invigilators were not
members of UCU.
In a statement on their
website, Imperial College
London say they will
“make every effort to
ensure all your assessment
activities go ahead and are
staffed appropriately.”
However, there are con-
cerns the dispute between
UCU and Universities
UK (UUK) will continue
throughout the dates of
the strike action. UCU has
warned its mandate for
strike action is valid for
six months, which means
exams and graduations
could be targeted this
summer.
Sally Hunt, UCU
general secretary, said:
“We are keeping the chan-
nels of communication
open. There is no sign
they intend to shift. There
will be significant strike
action from Thursday. It
will be ongoing until we
find a resolution.”
result was that manifestos
and information for can-
didates who had already
submitted was available
to view. The error meant
manifestos were visible
from the opening of nom-
inations, on Wednesday
31st
January, up until the
afternoon of Wednesday
14th
February.
The Union estimates
that by the time the man-
ifesto pages were taken
down, 237 candidates had
put themselves forward
for electable positions,
and, of those, nearly 60
had submitted some form
of a manifesto. The man-
ifesto they submitted may
not necessarily match
their final version, since
candidates can continue to
edit manifestos until the
beginning of March.
A representative from
the Union said the number
of submitted manifestos
represented a small
to previous years are of
limited value as the Clubs,
Societies, and Projects
involved are different,
we are expecting there
to be approximately 800
nominations received by
the deadline.”
The Deputy Returning
Officers have decided that
the Leadership Elections
should continue without
interruption.Inastatement
on the Union website,
they said “we decided
that if we cancelled the
elections we would cause
more disruption to can-
didates without undoing
any of the consequences
of the error, rendering it
a disproportionate and
unproductive response.”
Nominations for the
Leadership Elections
close on Sunday, 25th
February. Over 700 roles
are available, including
paid sabbatical roles. You

Elections error accidently reveals manifestos early
Union hit by breach to
database

Imperial College
Union was victim of
a data breach earlier
this month.
A
number of
m e m b e r s
of Imperial
College Union
(ICU) have had their
personal data extracted
from a Union database.
The breach, which
occurred on the 8th
of Feb-
ruary 2018, affected 267
past and current members
of Imperial College
Union, who had a limited
amount of personal data
accessed. These data
included their name, CID
number, date of birth,
gender, and academic
details, among others.
Not all individuals had all
these data accessed.
ICU was only made
aware of the break a week
later, on the 15th
of Febru-
ary. They informed ICT
Security, and disabled
the platform to allow the
breach to be contained. A
spokesperson for ICU said
“preventative measures
[have been] implemented
to prevent such actions
being repeated.”
The Union were able
to confirm that the attack
did not come from within
Imperial itself. They do
not believe it was targeted
at the Union, but rather
was an automated attack
that looked for vulnerable
databases.
ICU informed Felix the
breach was not serious
enough to warrant no-
tifying the Information
Commissioner’s Office.
In a statement, a Union
representative said:
“transparency and the
trust of our members is
important to Imperial
College Union, so as soon
as was practically possi-
ble, we have contacted the
individuals involved to let
them know.”
Later this year will see
the enforcement of the
General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR),
which sets out more
stringent guidance on data
sharing, and increased
sanctions for breaches.
