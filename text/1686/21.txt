Baftas2018:Apredictableawardsceremonythatleaves
the road to the Oscars clear
E
ven for those at
Imperial who
aren’t particular-
ly interested in
film, the presence of the
2018 Baftas was difficult
to miss. For one thing,
the evening was hosted at
the Royal Albert Hall, al-
lowing some students and
staff the chance to engage
in some star-spotting
(insert pun about Blackett
astro group here), but
annoying countless others
by blocking off a large
portion of Prince Consort
Road, adding valuable
seconds to coffee-run
times.
But for those of us who
are interested in film, the
Baftas proved an annoy-
ance in a slightly different
way: it was, quite simply,
monumentally dull.
Widely acknowledged
as the last hurdle to
pass on the long road to
the Academy Awards,
which are given out next
weekend, the Baftas
provide films, directors,
actors, and screenwriters
one last chance at success.
While in the vast majority
of years the Oscar front-
runners are set in stone by
this point, the Baftas have
been known to provide
some upset in recent years
– for example, last year,
when Dev Patel pipped
Mahershala Ali to the
Bafta for Best Supporting
ticularly true of the acting
categories – Frances Mc-
Dormand, Gary Oldman,
Allison Janney, and Sam
Rockwell have won their
respective categories
in the Critics’ Choice
Awards, Screen Actors
Guild awards, Golden
Globes, and Baftas,
meaning their success at
the Academy Awards is all
but assured.
Similarly Best Director
seems to be a lock for
Guillermo del Toro, who
was recognised for his
fantasyTheShapeofWater
at the Baftas, and Martin
McDonagh’s Three Bill-
boards Outside Ebbing,
Missouri is set to win Best
Original Screenplay. Call
Me by Your Name, one of
the best films of the past
year, will have to settle for
Best Adapted Screenplay
at the Oscars – given
James Ivory’s Bafta win
this week, the prediction
seems assured, but it’s a
disappointing haul.
The only major
category that seems to
provide the possibility of
upset is Best Film, and
even then it’s only being
contested between del
Toro’s The Shape of Water
and McDonagh’s Three
Billboards. While the fact
the Academy has moved
away from awarding Best
Director and Best Film to
the same work means it
could be Three Billboard’s
year, the growing backlash
to how McDonagh has
taken a sledgehammer to
the tricky subject of police
brutality and institutional
racism means The Shape
of Water could take it.
Nevertheless, it’s sad
that works like Call Me
by Your Name, Phantom
Thread, and Lady Bird
will likely fall by the
wayside.
The Baftas did provide
us with one joyous award:
Park Chan-Wook’s ex-
ceptional film The Hand-
maiden took home Best
Film Not in the English
Language. While The
Handmaiden was locked
out of the Oscar race –
South Korea didn’t even
choose it as their entry –
Park will have to console
himself with winning last
year’s Felix Film awards.
All we can hope for
now is the wrong name to
be read out of the enve-
lopes at the ceremony on
the March 4th
, although I
hear they haven’t invited
Faye Dunaway back…

Black Panther: Ryan Coogler breaks the mould of a
superhero film
Arriving in the UK with a wave of hype, will Black Panther live up to expectations? Well the newest addition to the
Marvel Cinematic Universe has this writer ready to switch passports.
A
rguably the
most antici-
pated film of
2018 arrived
last week. Black Panther,
the latest addition to
the Marvel Cinematic
Universe canon, and
directed by Ryan Coogler,
was released in cinemas
worldwide this February.
Black Panther is set in
the fictional country of
Wakanda, a technolog-
ically advanced nation
in Sub-Saharan Africa
which has separated itself
from the rest of the world
as a means to protect its
immense resources of
‘vibranium’, a fictitious
element which has
featured many times in the
Marvel mythos.
The film follows
T’Challa (Chadwick
Boseman), who, upon
the death of his father the
king, returns to take up
the mantle of the Black
Panther, protector of
the realm. His authority
and right to the throne,
however, is challenged by
Erik Killmonger (Michael
B. Jordan), an Ameri-
can-born usurper who
seeks to bring Wakanda
out of its isolationist ways
and share its technology
with oppressed (read:
black) people across the
globe.
A surface critique of
the film is that it follows
the formulaic pattern
which has given Marvel
films the large box office
returns they so often
command – action,
comedy, and a dash of
romance to boot (because
why not). However, such
a rudimentary analysis of
the film fails to capture its
more nuanced facets.
The film touches on in-
teresting points regarding
morality, good and evil:
by removing colonialism
and systemic injustices
from the equation, the
existence of Wakanda
allows for the presence
of black people on screen
without the burden of a
plotline which includes
racial injustice or oppres-
sion. It shows a culture
“Black Panther
shows a
societal
framework
free from
European
influences”
of people untainted and
free to evolve – the vision
of an Africa in which ad-
vancement is not separate
from tradition or culture;
a societal framework free
from European influences.
Furthermore, it is
arguably the women
who drive the plot: from
Okoye (Danai Gurira)
the head of the Dora
Milaje (the all-female
palace guard), to Nakia
(Lupita N’yongo), covert
Wakandan agent and
T’Challa’s love interest;
not to mention Ramonda
(Angela Bassett) the
Queen Mother or Princess
Shuri (Letitia Wright),
arguably the most brilliant
mind in the country. The
emphasis of black wom-
anhood is clear, but very
noticeably without the
‘strong independent black
woman who don’t need
no man’ trope – these are
all women whose actions
speak for them; fully
realised in their humanity,
something that is often
only afforded to white
male characters.
Of course, at its core,
Black Panther is a super-
hero film. And it squarely
ticks that box – the action
sequences are breath-tak-
ing (I’m told even better
in 3D), and the fight
scenes are nothing short
of bad-ass. But the beauty
of the film comes in its
setting – for once in a
superhero film the setting
isn’t New York City or a
Western metropolis. It’s a
distinctly African country:
the architecture, the
fashion, the soundtrack
are all deliberately
tailored to portray a rich
and vibrant culture.
One thing that has
certainly mis-attributed
to Black Panther is
that it is the first film to
feature a black superhero
(see: Blade, Hancock),
however that in no way
diminishes its cultural
importance: for many
people, this film is the first
opportunity to see Africa
and African culture as
something to be celebrat-
ed, particularly in light of
comments from President
Trump referring to such
countries as “shitholes”.
Black Panther has
provided an opportunity
to change perceptions of
Africa, as evidenced by
the hundreds of people
showing up to screenings
in traditional African garb
(myself included).
But it’s also a story of
a longing for something
unattainable. Part of the
plot’s undertone is the
complex relationship of
African-Americans with
their distant heritage;
simultaneously one of
yearning and of antipathy.
Through this, the ‘good-
evil’ narrative so native
to the superhero genre is
subverted in the conflict
between T’Challa and
Killmonger – at times,
it is difficult to side with
either.
If this is not convinc-
ing, its performance at the
box office so far speaks
for itself: in the four-day
period since opening
it earned $427 million
worldwide, surpassing
the returns from Justice
League’s entire run in
theatres. If nothing, this is
proof that black stories do
in fact, sell – something
which Hollywood will do
well to remember.
The real triumph of
Black Panther is its
success in highlighting
that black culture is not in
any way monolithic. In a
universe in which Norse
gods, alien empires, and
primordial mystic beings
are freely explored, it is a
refreshing reminder of the
wealth of story-telling that
can be gleaned from the
vast repository of existing
cultures here on Earth.
