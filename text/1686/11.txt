A wearable microfluidic sweat analytics device has progressed from the lab to use in numerous organisations.

U n i v e r s i t y
professor John
A. Rogers last
Friday published, along
with other scientists, his
research on a wearable
microfluidics sweat ana-
lytics device in the journal
Science Advances. He is
now collaborating with
many partners such as
Gatorade, the Seattle
Mariners, and the U.S. Air
Force to further develop,
test and bring the device
into wider distribution.
The device was initially
introduced in 2016 and,
as the name suggests, it
analyses sweat and its bi-
omarkers produced from
eccrine sweat glands with
high accuracy and in real
time. Information about
hydration levels is com-
municated to the user with
a simple visual read-out –
nothing fancy. The device
is soft and flexible and it
sits on the skin. It is a little
larger than a quarter coin
and is roughly around the
same thickness as well.
Earlier designs included
measurements of chloride
loss, glucose, lactate, and
pH levels in sweat.
Over the past year and
a half, newer designs also
measure concentrations of
heavy metals such as lead
and arsenic, along with
urea and creatinine levels.
This device allows
people to monitor their
sweat rate and electrolyte
loss so that they can keep
hydrated and replenish
their electrolytes when
different compartments.
In those compartments
there are chemical
reagents that react with
the sweat to produce
visible colour changes.
Those colour changes
relate to concentration of
different substances like
chloride or electrolytes.
“Most people want to
know if they are losing a
lot of chloride, a little bit
or almost none,” Rogers
said. “They can just
eyeball the device and de-
termine if their electrolyte
levels are high, medium,
or low.”
Aunique aspect of these
devices is that they can
measure the user’s sweat
underwater, for instance
needed. It also provides
real-time information on
how their sweat chemistry
changes during the day
or when doing a set of
exercises.
“Now we have devices
that fill sequentially in
time. This is important
because variations in
sweat biomarkers give
a sense of fatigue level
as you’re exercising. We
didn’t have that capability
previously,” said Rogers.
The target consumers
are widespread. Not only
can it be used on a daily
basis to monitor hydra-
tion, it can also be used by
athletes and military per-
sonnel as the information
provided will be detailed
enough to suit their needs.
If a person is using the
device while working
out, however, this doesn’t
mean that they have to
pause their workout to
comprehend the infor-
mation collected by the
device. This is because
sweat travels through the
microscopic channels
within the device and into
during aquatic sports.
This is achieved by using
new adhesive materials
and microfluidic designs
that have water-tight
seals. This ensures that
only sweat, and not water
surrounding the person,
enters the microfluidic
channels. The sweat ana-
lytics system is now rou-
tinely used by the swim
team in Northwestern
University as it allows the
coach and the swimmers
to be better informed on
levels of dehydration
during a practice session.
Jarod Schroeder, head
coach of Northwestern’s
men’s swimming team
said: “Skin-mounted
microfluidic devices from
the Rogers group allow
us, for the first time, to
determine sweat and elec-
trolyte loss continuously,
as it occurs in the pool
during swimming, without
any adverse impact on our
athletes... The remarkably
high levels of sweat loss
that occur in the pool
demands careful schedul-
ing for rehydration.”
One drawback of this
sweat analytics system
is that the information is
provided through colour
changes that the research
team claims qualitatively
relates to concentrations
of different substances.
This raises the question of
whether the colours can be
clearly distinguished by
people who have a certain
type of colour blindness,
for instance red-green
colour blindness.
Other drawbacks are
that the device can only be
used once for a few hours
so the device isn’t ideal
for activities that take up a
lot of time. A person who
uses it regularly would
have to keep buying these
systems as they use it up.
Despite these dis-
advantages, Epicore
Biosystems, a start-up
founded by Rogers’ group
through Northwestern’s
Innovation and New
Ventures Office, has
established large volume
manufacturing technolo-
gies for these microfluidic
systems. In the future,
along with making it low-
cost, the company plans
to co-package the systems
with products in related
lines, for instance nutri-
tion, skin health, cosmet-
ics and sports hydration
products. The company is
also planning on making
them usable in clinics and
rehabilitation centers.
