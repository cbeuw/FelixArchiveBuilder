Solo performance delivers insights on life
I
was not ready for
it. Completely un-
prepared for such a
simple but unbelieva-
ble performance by Carey
Mulligan. Rather than
overwhelming complex-
ity, it is the simplicity of
this beautiful show that
leaves one overwhelmed,
emphasised by the cosy
atmosphere of the Royal
Court Theatre.
With a small stage, no
props, and a simple set,
Carey Mulligan takes us
on a personal journey, told
by a friend. Perhaps rec-
ognising how biased her
opinion is, she provides
details - memories that
mattered to her and made
her story unique. How
lost she was in those early
years of adulthood, how
Southampton showed up
on/in her way and how
she told destiny to fuck off
and went to Paris. Often,
her easy speech brings out
laughter in the audience.
Her story glides along,
until she introduces us
to her husband - the way
they met, the way she had
a complete disgust for
the man. The simple and
funny way of life of that
man and how easily she,
bit by bit, makes us fall in
love with him too. How
could we not? - that is the
question.
The attraction of a
normal and predictable
way life shines over this
couple as well: kids,
a house, jobs. At the
beginning, this ideal life
story seems to represent
something for us, just
like it had for her - but
as she goes on, we are
compelled to wish it does
not anymore.
bring her life to where she
is now.
In an impressively
emotional performance,
Carey Mulligan turns
something that might
have been a feel-good
show into a much more
insightful play about the
most important aspects
that rule our lives. Some-
times, there are things we
cannot control, things that
do not go to plan, life is a
mess, it hurts, but we can
make it work. Situations
will leave us baffled, torn
apart, but people are brave
and bravery can be seen in
the simplest acts of some-
one’s life.
Girls and Boys is
a simple show full of
intention behind every
sentence. Carey Mulligan
begins with an ordinary
story, where we find
ourselves laughing at the
most quotidian situations.
However, she unexpect-
FlamencoabsentinthisFlamencoFestivalshow
I
like flamenco dance
and music, and was
thus particularly
excited about this
show; however, perhaps
because I chose the wrong
show out of the various
nights on offer, or because
the festival’s theme was
not as I had anticipated -
Isabel Bayón and Israel
Galván’s show, Dju-Dju
was spectacularly bad - so
bad, in fact, that I noticed
several audience members
leaving halfway through
the show.
For something billed
as part of the Flamenco
Festival, one would
expect some, well,
flamenco dancing.
Instead, the audience were
treated to a Jesus looka-
like walking around the
audience hugging random
people, a keyboardist
wearing, of all things,
a dressing gown, and a
white Christmas tree on
remote-controlled wheels.
Isabel Bayón, who is a
classical flamenco dancer,
hardly danced - there were
only two scenes where
she danced an appreciable
amount of flamenco. Even
then, these dances were
only teasing - just as we
thought we would finally
get a decent amount of
dancing, she stops - no
dance lasted more than
three minutes long.
When she did dance,
Bayón was great - I caught
snippets of the grandeur,
energy and spontaneity
of the flamenco art form
that originated from the
folk dancing of Southern
Spain. There were
elements of the dextrous
footwork and fluid hand
movements that make
flamenco so well-loved.
Granted, the theme
of this particular show
was black magic and
voodoo - practices that
are entrenched in Gypsy
culture, and thus, ex-
pressible in the flamenco
dance form. However, I
was expecting classical
flamenco dancing inspired
by motifs of black magic,
but what we got was a
bizarre narrative with
flashing lights, stomping,
lots of walking around,
and only a light sprinkling
of actual dancing. Perhaps
I should have known
better - the choreographer,
Israel Galván, is known
for his avant-garde twist
on flamenco performanc-
es.
In this case, the
‘avant-garde’ flavour was
excessive, so excessive
that it was simply bizarre,
and almost disrespectful.
The comic elements, such
as Jesus controlling the
Christmas tree or Bayón
riding her broomstick,
quickly got tired and took
on a crass flavour. I was
almost angry watching it,
angry at its debasement
of the flamenco art form,
and the joke on us that we
were watching this thing
on stage. At one point,
the show was cut by a
ridiculous video projected
onto the stage, of some
indistinct blurry footage
that served no purpose
whatsoever. In another
instance, Bayón’s fellow
dancers danced around
while gliding around in
a chair - what value that
would add, I have no clue.
Fortunately, this show
is only on one night of the
festival, and it is over. I
am sure the other nights
of the Flamenco Festival
will be better, or at least I
hope so. If you decide to
attend, I wish you a more
enjoyable experience.

Iolanthe: an odd choice for the current climate
B
affling, bright,
and bonkers
would be an
accurate way
to sum up the English
National Opera’s take
on Iolanthe. Having
originally been performed
back in 1882, the satirical
comedy about the House
of Lords versus a band of
fairies has been somewhat
rejuvenated, including a
Boris Johnson look-a-like
riding along on a bicycle.
To an opera-novice
such as myself, the phrase
‘Gilbert and Sullivan’ had
previously meant very
little. Now I know that
Gilbert and Sullivan were
co-creators of a range of
comic operas back in the
19th century, including
Iolanthe, a baffling tale
of Iolanthe the fairy,
who was banished from
Fairyland for marrying a
mortal man. Fast-forward
twenty-five years and
Iolanthe’s son, Strephon,
is in love with a shepherd-
ess, but unable to marry
her as her guardian and
his fellow politicians are
all in love with her too.
What may sound like a
sweet story of fighting
for true love is actually
a lot creepier than it first
seems.
It seemed odd that in
2018, when awareness
of sexual harassment is
rising, an opera in which a
scene with twenty old men
arguing over a nineteen-
year-old woman would be
allowed to go ahead and
even be seen as comical.
It was an uncomfortable
scene made more bizarre
by the shepherdess’ actual
guardian (and there-
fore father-like figure)
allowing it to happen and
participating in it himself.
In defence of the show,
it was written at a time
when societal rules were
drastically different to
our own, and, for the
time, perhaps the show
was somewhat successful
in displaying societies
with both women and
men in leadership roles.
Designed as a comical
satire, it is evident that the
elderly politicians aren’t
exactly model designs for
authority figures, and the
lives of both fairies and
mortal men are indeed
improved by the presence
of the other. Or, at least,
everyone seemed happier.
Beyond the obvious
plot flaws and peculiar-
ities (the fairies feeling
giddy over their nephew is
nearly as disturbing as the
politicians fighting for the
shepherdess), the show
has its positive moments.
The opening of the show
was a purely instrumental
number, with Timothy
Henty doing a grand job
of conducting a team
of talented musicians.
Their work was the most
impressive aspect of the
night, especially when
Henty politely laughed
along with a joke about
his bald spot, delivered
by a gently fireman-esque
character.
The fireman, acting as
the emcee for the night,
introduced each act with a
repertoire of mildly funny
jokes and even some
impressively self-aware
jokes about how middle
class the audience was.
It was evident that the
humour he was attempt-
ing at wasn’t designed
for a twenty-something
year old student, but
even I would admit his
extinguishing of the fire
effects during the show
was genuinely amusing.
Speaking of humour,
most of the jokes through-
out the production passed
straight over my head.
A prime example being
the odd farmyard animal
– including a unicorn -
randomly appearing on
stage. What seemed to me
as a misaimed pantomime
gag clearly worked as
laughter erupted around
me, but by the fourth
sheep I had still not caught
up with the herd.
Cal McCrystal, a
director and actor known
for his comic consultancy
work on films such as
Paddington and The
World’s End, has recently
turned to opera as a new
adventure. The director,
openly acknowledging the
satiricalnatureofIolanthe,
decided to go ahead with
the political jokes despite
the current situation of
British politics. Despite
his supposed expertise,
however, the few jokes
that succeeded were
repeated over and over
until the audience was left
with an uneasy feeling of
a sitcom audience follow-
ing a sign saying ‘laugh’.
A prime example would
be the use of stage hands
dressed in black morph
suits blindly searching
around the stage for the
props they were putting
out. What was at first
giggle-worthy grew into
a sigh by the end of the
song.
Logistically, the pro-
duction was an overall
success. The stage was
colourfully decorated,
an impressive large
train bursting through
a background garnered
the awe it deserved, and
the costumes were aptly
colourful and fairy-like.
The only two factors that
would have benefited
from alterations would
have been the volume
and subtitles. At times,
the cast were on the quiet
side, which was irritating
during speech, but would
have been fine during
the songs as the songs
were subtitled, had the
subtitles always been on
view. Repeated lines were
sometimes only shown
the first time of hearing.
If you missed the line that
crucial first time, tough
luck.
Overall, Iolanthe had
a community-hall feel
about it, but the singers,
despite whatever creepy
lyrics they were singing,
performed very well.
Though, if you find
yourself desiring an
exploration of opera, it’s
probably best to start with
another one.
ENO’s restaging of the 19th century comic opera fails to amuse.

IOLANTHE
edly transforms the story
in such a way that we
almost cannot accept that
the person starting the
story is the same one that
finishes it.
As Carey’s bright and
conflicted husband bril-
liantly puts it, sex with a
pretty girl without a soul
is like wanking to a dress.
So is watching a play that
does not inspire reflection.
Clearly, Girls and Boys
was not the case.
“The simplicity

beautiful show

She does not dwell on
the major moments of her
life, neither incidences of
extreme sadness or joy.
Much more relatable than
that, they are the cher-
ished moments that need
no justification, and as the
story follows its own way,
it sets out the factors that
