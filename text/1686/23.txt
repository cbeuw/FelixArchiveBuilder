It’s time to take five: Under Pressure
is here!
Imperial can be like a pressure cooker. It’s time to take a break, and learn
how to cope with the stress.

oming up on
March 1st
is
U n i v e r s i t y
Mental Health
Day; dedicated to pro-
moting awareness for
student wellbeing across
the country. Without
a doubt, studying at
Imperial is incredibly
stressful, which can take a
serious toll on a student’s
wellbeing; there are a lot
of deadlines, revision,
and exams throughout the
year; and, at some point,
everyone has felt a bit
out of their depth. That’s
why over the next week
the Under Pressure cam-
paign is taking over the
campuses to give students
an opportunity to have
fun and learn strategies to
cope with stress.
During the week, there
will be a multitude of
stress-busting events for
you to take part in. At
South Kensington, there
will be:
• Several medi-
tation sessions through
the week, with a session
Monday 13:05-13:35
focusing on Christian tra-
ditions, a session Tuesday
12:05-12:50 focusing on
using mindfulness with
meditation and a session
Friday 13:00-13:50
focusing on Buddhist
traditions (all medita-
tion sessions will take
place in the Chaplaincy
Multi-Faith Centre, 10
Prince’s Gardens).
• Free massages in
the SAF Foyer on Tuesday
11:00-13:30 – slots for
that went very quickly last
year so get in early!
• Relaxation Arts
and Crafts activities
and smoothie making in
Metric and Beit Quad on
Friday from 11:30-13:00.
Come along to have a free
smoothie, give mindful
colouring a go, and make
your own stress ball!
There will also be
activities on Charing
Bar on Monday 11:00-
15:30 and free massages
running in the Reynolds
Bar on Tuesday 14:30-
17:00.
The highlight of the
week, however, will be
the University Mental
Health Day celebrations
on Thursday; from 11:00-
15:30 there will be a fair-
ground on Queen’s Lawn!
There will be plenty of
games and fun to enjoy
so take a break out of
your day to check out the
activities on offer.
A list of all activities
and times can be found
on the Union Website,
so check it out if you are
unsure what’s going on.
Other resources are also
available there, such as
stress busting and revision
tips, a weekly meal plan
template, and a list of
resources that give help
and advice.
These activities are not
the only thing that’s hap-
pening as part of Under
Pressure! The Union Shop
will be selling fidget cubes
at a reduced cost of £3.95,
which are a great tool
for anyone’s pencil case
during exam season. Each
face of the cube contains
a different stimulus with
a variety of textures,
some noisy and some
silent, to provide easy
and discrete anxiety relief
anywhere from lectures
to public transport. Stress
balls are designed for
people to release tension
when stressed, however
this is not always how
people react to stress! If
you instead fidget when
stressed, especially if you
bite your nails, twist your
hair, click pens or tap
your fingers on surfaces, I
would recommend giving
a fidget cube a go.
Overall, this week
is here to help every
student relax and equip
themselves for the exam
season ahead, so make the
most of it!
Run for a liberation
position!
T
his year, liberation has really taken
off as a priority for Imperial College
Union.Campushasseenawareness-
raising events and celebrations
including Black History Month, Disability
History Month, Interfaith week, and the
ongoing LGBT History Month (as shown by
the currently-rainbow-hued Queen’s Tower).
Campaigns on everything from gender
neutral bathrooms to divestment have been
plastered across Felix, dominated meetings,
and sparked conversations on what can
be done to improve equality and student
wellbeing on campus. This is a fantastic first
step to giving liberation work on campus the
respect it deserves, but it cannot end here;
that’s why we need keen students to run
for the Liberation and Community Officer
positions in this year’s upcoming elections.
All the Liberation and Community Officer
positions have similar responsibilities:
representing their liberation group in high-
level Union meetings, supporting student
campaigns and leading lobbying and policy
change within the Union and wider Imperial
community. The roles open for election are:
• Black & Minority Ethnic Officer
• Disabilities Officer
• Ethics & Environment Officer
• Gender Equality Officer
• Interfaith Officer
• International Officer
• LGBT+ Officer
• Mental Health Officer
Nominations close midnight on Sunday,
so if you’re keen to help move liberation
work forward nominate yourself now!
