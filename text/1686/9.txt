other less charismatic

that photos taken by both
amateurs and profession-

One gentleman, Joel
Satore, has made it his
life’s mission to photo-
graph the approximately
12,000 species of animals
currently residing in zoos,
aquariums, and rescue
centres. In 2005, Joel
started the ‘Photo Ark’
in an attempt to capture
portraits of all of these
species in to raise aware-
ness of their plight. Each
species is photographed
against a black or white
background in order to
ensure that each portrait

L
ooking forward
to the future of
species con-
servation, the
depressing and sobering
truth is that some species
may not be around for
future generations to
enjoy. The only evidence
of their existence will
be media, and written
reports or books docu-
menting their ecology
and distribution. How
will future generations
know what some of the
more obscure endan-
gered species looked
is comparable. The stark
contrast draws attention
to the eyes of the subject,
therefore connecting the
observer with that particu-
lar species. As of the time
of writing, a total of 7,521
species have already been
photographed and become
part of the growing Photo
Ark! Joel estimates that it
will take him an addition-
al 15 years to finish pho-
tographing the remaining
~4,500 species.
Joel’s goal is simple- to
try and show the world
of biodiversity in a new
light, and attempt to get
everyone to care about
the species currently
facing extinction, whilst
there is still time to act.
This project has recently
joined in a partnership
with National Geograph-
ic in order to help raise
awareness and funds to
aid Joel’s mission. The
fortunes of some species
since the start of the
project have changed for
the worse. One of these
is a species of frog which
became extinct in Sep-
tember 2016, when the
last known individual of
the Rabb’s fringed-limbed
tree frog, nicknamed
‘Toughie,’ passed away.
The species suffered
heavy declines in Panama
due to disease; the last
known individuals were
taken into captivity to es-
tablish a captive breeding
program.
Unfortunately, this
failed with the last
female dying in 2009,
meaning the species was
functionally extinct until
Toughie’s death. Hope-
fully the other species on
the Photo Ark will gain
the awareness, funding
and the protection they
need in order to recover
and remain in the wild
for future generations to
enjoy.
How brain chemicals make you crave alcohol

A
fter a demand-
ing week at
university, it is
finally Friday
and your friends have
suggested to go for drinks
later that evening. ‘Ok…
just one drink’, you
replied, but several hours
later you are smashed,
and walking in a straight
line is practically impos-
sible! It is apparent that a
hangover is coming your
way, and you think to
yourself – why did I not
stop after the first drink?
Although it is funny to
watch your drunk friend
hitting on a statue (trust
me it is hilarious) alco-
holism is not a laughing
matter. It gravely impacts
on the lives of many indi-
viduals, and alcohol-re-
lated diseases put a heavy
burden on our healthcare
system and the economy.
Hence, it is important to
understand the disease in
order to develop better
treatments for alcohol
dependence.
A new therapeutic
target was investigated by
a research group led by
Hu Cheng, a senior sci-
entist in the Department
of Psychological and
Brain Sciences in Indiana,
USA. They showed that
a chemical in the brain
formally known as a neu-
rotransmitter, mediates
cued alcohol cravings.
Alcohol cravings, like
hunger, can be triggered
by smell, sound, and
visual cues – for example
pictures of alcohol. In
our daily lives, we come
across this on the high
street without even re-
alising it, such as when
bakeries entice customers
with their distinct aromas!
More often than not we
end up strolling in, which
is due to our brains asso-
ciating these cues with
rewards. This is attributed
to a specific neurotrans-
mitter called glutamate,
which is a key regulator in
the reward pathways.
In our brains, levels
of neurotransmitters are
maintained with a fine
balance. A tip of this
delicate equilibrium is
associated with diseases
such as depression and
Parkinson’s disease.
Since the anterior cingu-
late cortex (ACC), along
with glutamate are both
involved in the brain’s
reward network, unsur-
prisingly, a change in the
level of the neurotrans-
mitter has been linked to
alcohol addiction.
Previously, it has
been reported that ACC
activity is related to other
forms of addiction such as
nicotine and illicit drugs;
however, the underlying
neurotransmitter changes
related to alcohol craving
was unknown.
For this reason, the
research group studied
and compared brain scans
of different groups using
imaging technology such
as magnetic resonance
spectroscopy, with a focus
on the level of glutamate
in alcohol-dependent
patients versus a control
group. The research group
demonstrated the area
involved in glutamate
signalling overlaps with
the brain regions that
responds to alcohol-relat-
ed cues, thus implicating
the role of ACC and
glutamate in mediating
addiction.
Furthermore, when the
alcohol-dependent group
were shown pictures
of alcohol, glutamate
concentration in the ACC
significantly dropped. In
the control group with no
alcohol dependence little
or no change was seen in
their glutamate level. This
result nicely demonstrates
the important role of
glutamate in cue-induced
relapse in humans, thus
new therapeutics may
now seek to target glu-
tamate levels to manage
addictions!
Though the study pop-
ulation size is quite small
with only 17 patients
studied, one cannot just
yet reduce alcoholism to
a problem to be treated by
pills. Nonetheless, it is a
great step towards under-
standing the biological
causation of addiction.
Moreover, we can start
helping those in need as
well as breaking down
the social stigma against
those who are physically
dependent on alcohol.
