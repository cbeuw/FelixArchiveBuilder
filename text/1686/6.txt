Politics, ideologies, and how to choose the
right side
There’s a reason why candidates at Union elections are so boring. It’s the same reason the left
and the right exist in real-world politics.

E
very time student
elections come
back to Imperial,
I always remem-
ber the sheer confusion of
my old flatmate when de-
ciding whom to vote for:
“Back home in Italy, there
is always a left-wing and
a right-wing candidate in
student politics. Choosing
who to vote for was much
easier there”.
I won’t get into what
this says about Italians
in general, but I do
acknowledge it’s an inter-
esting approach to student
politics. The “pressure” of
properly reading all the
manifestos and the guilt of
voting for whoever looks
friendlier in the photo is
taken away. It’s just so
easy. But that’s not what
happens in the UK. Here
we vote on manifestos.
At first sight, pure
manifestos just seem like
the right approach: you
read what each candidate
proposes and decide
rationally, depending on
the issues you care about,
without any ideological
prejudice blurring your
mind from choosing the
right one. It just seems
like the thing you should
do.
If you let your curious
mind to think this through
further, though, you start
to wonder whether this
approach would work
in real life politics. It’s
a claim many centrist
parties like to make:
“vote policies, don’t vote
ideology. Read manifestos
and vote for the proposals
you care about. Politics
isn’t football, so stop
cheering for your party
like it’s your team, and put
some effort into voting
with your head. Contro-
versies are just tools the
left and right use to stir
things up”. Centrist parties
love to promote this kind
of thinking. They adore
coming out as the purely
enlightened sensible
option. Emmanuel
Macron claimed several
times he was neither left
nor right. Similarly Albert
Rivera, leader of Spain’s
centrist party, has claimed
the same thing during
campaigns.
Keep digging further
into this way of voting,
however, and you’ll
eventually find it’s just
nonsense. At least in the
long run. And there’s a
simple, nearly mathemat-
ical reason why. Candi-
dates can copy policies. If
a policy is uncontroversial
and its goodness is uni-
versally accepted, every
candidate will put it in
their manifesto. And why
wouldn’t they? It’s for the
greater good!
So how are candidates
supposed to differ, if, in
the long run, all univer-
sally good policies are
adopted by all of them?
They differ in how they
approach controversial
policies. Be it deciding
between public cuts and
public spending, military
intervention in the
Middle East, immigration
policies – it is the answer
to controversial questions
that really defines a
candidate. At least the
serious candidates in real
world politics. This is, in
fact, the only reason the
concept of left and right
wing politics exist, and
why it will always exist. It
makes the whole process
of sorting out controver-
sial positions easier. What
baffles me, then, about
every student election here
at Imperial, is that some
candidates often differ
because they propose
different uncontroversial
proposals, which just
shows a massive amount
of sheer incompetence.
How difficult is it to copy
the proposal? How out
of the loop are you as a
candidate, that others are
proposing easy, uncon-
troversial policies and
you haven’t even heard
of them? Just do your
research, please. I implore
you.
Ok, we’ve established
that you need the concepts
of left and right to have a
serious candidate, so now
our own beliefs come to
play in the vote. We often
complain that students
at Imperial are very
apolitical. While some
of it might come from
privilege – you don’t need
to take a strong stance on
issues if the system grants
you everything you need–
some of it might come
from the intrinsic nature
of the Imperial student.

“We know
that you need
the concepts
of left and
right to have
a serious
candidate”
they are used to solving
problems where there is
a factually right solution
backed by evidence.
Backing a certain candi-
date or ideology certainly
feels like it’s against
evidence and reason,
because ideology, in the
end, is just an assortment
of collective myths and
beliefs.
Let’s define a spectrum
so you, as a reader, can
have a bit of an interac-
tive experience placing
yourself at some point in
between two extremes.
“You need
to actually
believe in
something
in order to
change the
world”
Staff strikes and workers rights – how can we
bring true equality?
This week, with all the strikes going on, Grumpy Bastard looks at why they are happening at
all. And they have a solution to stop this happening again.
T
his week,
Imperial has
been shoved
rudely into the
modern age by encoun-
tering workers’ rights,
an issue that has plagued
employers since the Black
Death wiped out the ma-
jority of the peasants. The
immediate consequence
of this was that the nobles
and landlords had to light-
en up on the oppression
because there weren’t
enough serfs to slave in
the fields. Over time, the
cause of workers rights
has been advanced by the
threat of violence by rev-
olution or revolt as well
as the establishment of
unions. Union has almost
become a dirty word since
their defeat by the Iron
Lady in the 1980s, but
they probably have had
a net beneficial effect for
those of us unfortunate
enough to have to work
for a living.
Apparently, the issue
that has brought the meek
and mild lecturers onto
the streets is that Imperial
is now changing its
pension system. Beyond
that, I, like most of my
fellow students, have no
idea what is going on. I
tried reading the handout
that one of the union rep-
resentatives was aggres-
sively forcing on those of
us innocently wandering
through Sherfield, but I
nearly fell asleep halfway
through the words
“individual investment
scheme.” I have decided,
like the rest of the world,
that facts are boring and
I can rely on the more
compelling and probably
accurate assertion that the
college is evil for attempt-
ing to take the pensions
away and I should stand
with the workers; or at
least not resent them too
much for robbing me of
my education.
The alternative narra-
tive, the one that is com-
pletely devoid of empathy
and therefore will appeal
to physicists, is that, as I
own the lecturers because
of the substantial tuition
fees I pay, they are putting
me at a considerable
disadvantage for daring
to voice these socialist
demands. Some have
even argued for a refund
of fees for the lectures
and tutorials missed as
the workers of Imperial
College crusade for fair
treatment, but I’m unsure
if they want compensation
from the College or the
lecturers themselves. This
is of course a ridiculous
stance to take, as the
College would sooner part
with a good third of their
research staff before re-
funding students. Heaven
forbid that the President
should take a pay cut.
This of course follows
the general trend of a
reduction in standards
of pensions worldwide.
Carillion, the construction
firm, went bust follow-
ing a gaping hole in its
pensions scheme, and
BHS employees suffered
from a colossal hole in
their pension scheme after
Philip Green had stripped
the company of all its
value and used the wealth
to build a fleet of yachts
and become the king of
the sea. I for one welcome
this lack of foresight and
preparation for old age
which will allow further
concentration of wealth
in the hands of those that
are already incredibly
wealthy. I mean, being
a peasant in pre-plague
Europe really wasn’t that
bad if you’re a big fan
of mud, beatings and no
human rights. We just
have to hold out for the
next round of antibiotic
resistant bacteria for
society to become equal
once more.
On one extreme there’s
the sceptical, doubting,
open-minded person.
Someone who’s not com-
pletely sure who to vote
for in the next election.
This type of person is
a shape-shifter; an ever
changing, hard-to-pin
down voter. On the other
side of the spectrum
there’s the believer by
will. The true believer
thinks that her ideas are
better for the world. Much
more close-minded and
hard to convince, she
knows exactly who she’s
voting for and why.
Each side has its pecu-
liarities. The ones on the
sceptic side tend to love
having arguments, and are
particularly strong against
any ad-hominem attacks
because it’s so hard to pin
them down. But it’s hard
for anything of value to
come out if your ideas are
not grounded at all and
lack the necessary depth.
Being on the other
side is different. When
you’re so convinced of
your ideas, because you
are much harder to sway
to the other side, you
can potentially end up
becoming a Nazi without
noticing it. And this is a
big dilemma, because you
can only truly change the
world if you really believe
in what you are doing.
Be it an entrepreneur,
a social activist or an
artist, it’s hard to imagine
them having any positive
impact on the world
without firmly believing
they can do it without any
factual evidence. And this
is the big problem. You
can’t change the world
through politics by being
a shape-shifting, ideolog-
ically-empty centrist who
just focusses on hard facts.
You have to take a side
and affirm your beliefs in
a well-grounded ideology.
But it’s hard. If you’re
on the sceptic side of the
spectrum, you know how
hard it is. Some people are
so firm in their beliefs it’s
close to admirable. Some
lefties are born lefties;
some religious people are
born religious (by born I
of course mean nurtured
by their families). But
other people go through
shattering processes of
destruction and rebuilding
of their own values, con-
stantly rediscovering and
re-examining their views
of the world.
If you’re one of those
Imperial students who
have become apolitical
because you’re on the
doubting side of the
spectrum, fear not.
There’s one advantage:
you’re generally a politi-
cian’s most prized target
– you’re the swing voter.
They all compete for your
vote. But you do have to
get out of this situation
at some point: remember,
you need to actually
believe in something in
order to change the world.
Here are some things you
might want to consider:
• A c k n o w l e d g e
that your scepticism is a
healthy initial approach to
ideology – no one wants
to end up being a Scien-
tologist.
• Realise that even
Maths is based on axioms
we choose. Yes, they tend
to be self-evident, but we
still need axioms to say
something meaningful
about anything.
• Set up your first
principles: these will be
your axioms. You can
ground them in intuitions
if you want: things you
feel that are essential and
self-evident. You might
feel that equality, freedom
or universal happiness is
a basic principle in which
you can ground your
ideas.
• Once you are
firm in your ground, start
moving into the other side
of the spectrum. Tread
slowly but firmly. You can
approach it in a Cartesian
way, if you like, doubting
everything you know and
accepting things very
carefully.
• Realise that there
are no right or wrong
answers, and that what
matters is what you’ve
decided to matter, so it’s
important to you and so
you’re willing to convince
other people about it.
And just like that you
can end up being a healthy
sceptic with well-ground-
ed ideas. Combine this
with a little passion and
perseverance and you’ll
end up changing the
world.
Oh, and to those of you
who thought this article
was about how to vote
in the union elections:
I’m sorry. I have no clue.
Maybe try to make an
effort and read the bloody
manifestos. But we both
know you’re not going
to do that, so just look at
the pictures and vote for
someone who doesn’t
seem incompetent. Who
the fuck cares?
