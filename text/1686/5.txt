Korean delegation

Korean ice hockey team is a terrible idea.

O
ne of the worst
clichés trotted
out during
world sporting
events, like the Olympics,
is that sport should be
above politics. Yet this
couldn’t be further from
the truth. Some of the
most memorable mo-
ments in Olympic history
have been steeped in pol-
itics: from Jesse Owens’
defying Adolf Hitler’s
Aryan supremacy right
under his nose to the black
power salute challenging
racial bigotry in the 1968
Summer Olympics. Thus,
when the South Korean
government invited their
bitter rivals from the north
to compete alongside
them in the current Winter
Olympics, it was well
within this long tradition
of sports and politics
being intertwined. Yet the
question that remains is
whether this remarkable
act of reconciliation by
the south will have any
positive effect or not. This
is not the first time the
North and the South have
marched together in an in-
ternational sporting event:
they did so most recently
in the 2014 Asian Games.
Yet each time, such ges-
tures by the South have
been met by nuclear tests
and other UN violations.
Instead, could this
gesture bring further le-
gitimacy to the Kim-Jong
Un regime? The Kim
family has dilapidated the
vitality of the innocent
people of North Korea by
transforming the entire
country into a concen-
tration camp. They have
waged a war of constant
fear on their neighbours
by routinely threatening
them with nuclear anni-
hilation, accompanied
by sporadic kidnappings
and assassinations. It
is difficult to argue to
South Koreans, who live
under the constant spectre
of nuclear mushroom
clouds, that this tyranny
could be rewarded by the
honour and pageantry of
the Olympic Games.
It should be remem-
bered that this decision
by the South Korean
government has not
been very popular with
its people. It was hard
earned tax dollars from
the South Korean citizens
that financed the hosting
of this event. Yet in events
like ice hockey where both
nations are competing as
one unit, South Korean
athletes who have trained
for years to compete and
represent their country in
front of their home crowd
are having to sacrifice
their well-earned places
to make way for their
ill-trained North Korean
counter parts. As a result,
one the key tenants of the
Olympics, meritocracy,
is being abandoned for a
gimmick that is unlikely
to yield any meaningful
results.
The citizens of South
Korea have provided
large quantities of finan-
cial aid and food relief
to the North. Yet their
gestures of good will have
been reciprocated with
hateful propaganda by the
regime to their isolated
people. Therefore, a time
may come in the future
when South Koreans say
enough is enough. Let us
hope that this unnecessary
gesture does not result
in greater resentment by
South Koreans which
would hinder future peace
efforts.
parallel. The last time
South Korea hosted the
Olympics (the Summer
event in 1988) the North
Koreans shot down a
South Korean passenger
airliner, killing over one
hundred people.
However, by yielding
to intimidation, the South
Koreans have unilaterally
declared that blackmail
works. At the heart of
the Olympic spirit is
following the rule book.
Has the threat of terror-
ism been incorporated
into the Olympic charter
somehow?
The Olympic spirit,
since ancient Greece, has
symbolised the hope for
world peace, yet in reality
such events cannot be
allowed to be hosted in
political silos. We must
not be lulled into a false
kumbaya moment. The
North Koreans will not
enter the negotiating
table to surrender their
nuclear arsenal and
abandon their hostile and
aggressive posture by
simply allowing them to
compete in the Olympics
alongside their South
Korean brethren. North
Korea is a pariah, and so
needs to be isolated and
not given further gestures
of goodwill. South Africa
was boycotted for over a
generation from sporting
events due to apartheid.
Surely the vast crimes
of North Korea warrant
a similar, if not greater,
global isolation.
The pathway to hell
is often paved by good
intentions. The unification
of the Korean peninsula
through peaceful and
diplomatic means is a
noble idea. It is important,
however, to remember
that the vast majority of
South Koreans were born
after the Korean War in the
1950s – with no memory
of a unified Korea. Yet
why should young South
Koreans have to see
their sporting heroes cast
aside for political stunts
that have little prospects
of advancing the peace
process? South Korea
and the rest of the world
shouldn’t abandon the
people imprisoned within
that slave state. And to
their immense credit, the
family of nations led by
South Korea have led the
humanitarian aid effort
for decades that has
prevented mass genocide
due to starvation. But
welcoming the North
Korean regime to parade
themselves under the
Olympic banner as if there
is no real crisis at hand,
will do a disservice to the
seriousness required.
