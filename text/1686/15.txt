T
he book that
first led me to
the wonderful
world of queer
literature was Oranges
are Not the Only Fruit by
Jeanette Winterson. As
one of our A level texts,
Oranges provided me
with a first hand account
of what it was like to
grow up as a lesbian girl,
especially within a con-
servative, ultra-religious
family. A bildungsroman
of a lesbian girl involves
self-discovery, and an
honest exploration of sex-
uality and identity. Packed
full of quotable lines, both
for their humour and
insight, Winterson’s novel
was immensely enjoya-
ble, and opened my eyes
to queer narratives.
Afewyearsafter,Icame
across another Winterson
book – Written on the
Body, which was a loftier
look at lesbian love, from
a narrator that seems more
settled in her identity than
in Oranges. I read it as a
female narrator, but their
sex is never specified –
meaning that reading it as
a same-sex relationship
says as much about the
reader as the author; or
perhaps, how much the
reader knows about the
author.
The narrator is involved
in a blissful relationship
with a married woman,
onethatembodiespassion,
kindness, and innocence.
In contrast, the heterosex-
ual marriage is destructive
and breaks things apart.
Using descriptions of
body parts to anatomical
detail, the narrator sings
her love and desire for
her partner, embodied in
the lyrical metaphors that
worship her body in all its
beauty and flaws.
Carol Ann Duffy’s
poetry celebrates
same-sex relationships
in lyrical form, painting
images and creating
metaphors that turn het-
erotypical romance and
sex on its head. In her
poem ‘Girlfriends’, the
graphic nature of ‘your
mouth to the red gold, the
pink shadows’ is balanced
“The exciting
diversity of
the human
community
needs to be
accessible and
available”
by the gentle, feminine
colours, and the softness
of ‘shadows’. Lesbian sex
is described as delicately
beautiful - in the moment
of climax she saw her
‘fingers counting them-
selves, dancing’ in the air.
Rather than being
focused on lesbian rela-
tionships, as the above
are, Jackie Kay’s Trumpet
is a nuanced look at the
ambiguity of gender
demarcations in relation-
ships, and the strength of
love that transcends all
societal boundaries.
The relationship
between Millie, and her
husband, Joss, who is a
biological man living as a
woman, has been distilled
to the most pure form - not
one between a man and a
woman, nor between two
women (as society tries to
pigeonhole them as), but
one between, simply, two
people. The book follows
the media’s dogged
pursuit of the matter of
Joss’ ‘real’ gender, as we
see a family torn apart
by attempts to label their
relationship. Trumpet is
an incredible exploration
of how inflexible, yet in-
herently superficial, labels
can be, and what it takes
to shake them off.
The classic tale of
gender fluidity has got
to be Virginia Woolf’s
Orlando, where a young
aristocratic man changes
his sex halfway through
the book and becomes a
woman.
Gender fluidity and
ambiguity permeate
every aspect of the book,
from Orlando’s object
of attraction as a man to
her independent nature
as a woman determined
to publish her poetry. The
moment of sex change
is described as entirely
mundane, where simply,
‘he was a woman.’ And
then he went to have a
bath. The unceremonial
nature of the scene em-
phasises the smooth tran-
sition between the sexes,
as if it was not a big deal
at all. Orlando’s gender
identity at any point in
time is determined by his
‘performance’, and is not
an inherent fact.
LGBT themes have
also flourished in fiction
inspired by more recent
history. Larry Kramer’s
The Normal Heart is a
play based on his own
struggles to get AIDS in
the gay community of
1980s New York recog-
nised by the government,
which, at the time, was
seen as a ‘gay disease’and
largely ignored as people
continued to die. This
forms a significant part of
the solidarity of the gay
movement and fight for
recognition.
Just slightly further
ahead in time, Tony Kush-
ner’s Angels in America
explores the situation of
AIDS in New York and
how it impacts individual
lives and relationships.
Drawing parallels
between the relationship
between a gay couple
and the larger trajectory
of America’s society, the
play explores the idea of
‘movement’ - society’s
relentless march towards
progress, and the danger
of stalling. ‘The world
only spins forward,’ says
Prior, a gay man stricken
with AIDS, expressing
hope for the future of the
gay community - ‘we
will be citizens’ - as well
as hope for the future of
America and its national
consciousness.
Everyone’s journey
into queer literature is
personal, and will be
shaped by the specific
books we chose to read at a
specific times in our lives.
These were the books that
touched me and helped to
lift the veil of the largely
heterotypical literature
out there by telling the
stories from the margins.
The exciting diversity of
the human community
needs to be accessible and
available - as a celebration
of difference, but at the
same time also to combat
bigotry and to tell others
that they are not alone.
