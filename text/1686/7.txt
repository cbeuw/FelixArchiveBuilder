id you know
that the police
estimated that
upwards of
95,000 rapes take place
each year in England and
Wales?And yet the Crown
Prosecution Service (CPS)
only managed to convict
a rapist in 2991 cases
in 2016/17 – that’s only
3%. The police estimated
that upwards of 517,000
sexual offences occur
each year in England and
Wales and yet the CPS
only managed to convict
a perpetrator in 10,721
cases in 2016/17 – that’s
only 2%.
Recent events have
brought the issue of rape
and sexual assault into
the public spotlight, and
with dismay have we seen
public figures exposed
for their abuse of power.
Rightfully so we should
be outraged at them and
their actions; but we
cannot solely be outraged
at the perpetrators, we
must acknowledge the
role the criminal justice
system (CJS) has played
in allowing the perpetra-
tors to go unchecked. We
must not blame victims
for not coming forward
– victim-blaming is toxic
and damaging. Instead
we must hold our CJS ac-
countable for having had
policies in place that did
not allow for a fair trial,
and left victims feeling
silenced. And let us never
forget what researchers
found when analysing
the institutional culture
at Imperial: “Despite
Imperial’s ‘no tolerance’
stance on harassment
and bullying, women in
particular reported being
silenced in various ways.”
An often-cited reason
for perpetrators evading
conviction is that victims
need to speak up more
and go to the police. Let’s
explore this statement by
trying to understand what
happens when victims do
go to the police. From
Oct 2016 to Sep 2017 the
police recorded 48,773
rape offences, an increase
of 29% on last year. The
police then assigned
an “outcome” to each
reported case. Rape case
outcomes in the year
ending March 2016, as of
July 2017 (1 year and 3
months later) included:
• ~25% of cases had
still not been assigned an
outcome, i.e. after 1 year
and 3 months the police
had still not decided what
to do.
• ~35% of cases faced
evidential difficulties
where the victim did not
support action – what are
the police doing to make
35% of victims that went
to the police for justice
later withdraw support?
• Only ~10% resulted in
a suspect being charged or
summonsed. This needs
to be seen in context of
the police identifying a
suspect in at least 96% of
rape cases
Cases with a charged
or summonsed suspect
will be brought to court
by the CPS. With a long
investigation period,
only a small fraction of
reported cases resulting in
a suspect being charged,
and the fact that fake rape
accusations almost never
happen one would expect
that once in court, cases
would be resolved quickly
and almost always end
in a conviction. But no,
of the 5190 cases of rape
the CPS completed in
2016-17, the prosecu-
tion was unsuccessful a
shocking 42.4% of the
time, only managing a
conviction in 2991 of the
cases. In addition “the
median number of days
for rape offences to be
assigned an outcome was
144 days”; the median
time taken from charge to
completion for rape cases
was 259 days, and has
increased every year since
2010. 259 days + 144 days
= 403 days. And that’s just
the median; being unlucky
can mean waiting much,
much longer. Requiring
anyone going through a
rape trial to wait such a
long time is just not fair.
48,773 cases of rape
reported are to the
police, and only 2,991
it includes non-recent
cases). It would therefore
be misleading to think
that 48773/95000=51%
of incidents last year were
reported to the police.
For consistency I simply
presented the most recent
data.
It is important to
remember in this discus-
sion that while the system
can still get better, it has
most definitely been
improving a lot over the
last ten years. In 2016-17,
as compared to 2007-08,
prosecutions for Violence
Against Women and Girls
have increased by 48.8%,
with a corresponding
62.7% increase in con-
victions (from 51,974
convictions to 84,565);
convictions for sexual
offences including rape
and child sexual abuse is
up 71.5% over the same
period. The CPS has pub-
lished the report “Rape
Action Plan” to outline
tangible changes being
made to make court cases
fairer, including this reas-
suring message: “shifting
the focus away from the
credibility of the victim
to the credibility of the
overall allegation. This
will also involve consid-
eration of the behaviour
of the defendant including
around seeking consent”.
I think Imperial should
incorporate this thinking
when dealing with sexual
harassment and assault.
Improvements in police
reporting standards, and
high-profile cases like
Operation Yewtree and
#metoo, have encouraged
more victims to come
forward; but this is putting
the system under pressure,
causing case completion
times to increase and con-
viction rates to decrease.
If the police and CPS
Outcomes asssigned to rape offences in the year ending March 2016 //Home Office
convictions by the CPS in
2016/17. And then there’s
the issue of secondary
victimisation, yet another
aspect making interacting
with the judicial system
even more painful. Hope-
fully this will show that
encouraging more victims
to come forward is not
enough. We need lasting
policy change to make the
CJS perform much better
than it is now.
Note that due to the
aggregate publishing of
data, tracking of individu-
al cases is impossible, thus
the number of reported
cases in 2016/17 will not
be directly comparable
with the number of con-
victions in 2016/17, as
cases take a long time to
complete. “Total reported
cases in 2016/17” refers
to when the incident is
reported, not when the
incident took place (i.e.
How we sometimes want to do too much, and
what we can do about it
Comment writer Abdulrahman Alhadad talks about the subtle difference between working a
lot and giving a lot.
W

criticisms
of others
telling us that we do not
do enough of what we
are supposed to. Seldom,
however, do the words,
“you have to do less” fall
upon our ears.

can as fast as we can. This
means more studying for
students, more exercising
to reach our fitness goals,
and more work to earn
more money! Therein
arise the terms workaholic
and the like, which our
disdain for is nothing
more than a pseudo-at-
tempt to ease our minds at
the mention of those who
are bigger and better than
ourselves. Deep down
inside, however, we find
our inner voice question-
ing itself, asking itself
“how do they do it?”
I, for one, have lived
and breathed the negative
sides of too much. For
months on end, I worked
and worked. Praised by
my family, friends, and
acquaintances on my
progress, those were but
empty words falling upon
deaf ears. I wanted more.
And so, to get more, one
must do more, I guessed.
But how wrong I was…
Attached to the good
blessings that I accumu-
lated from simply not
trying, I could not accept
that what was in my hands
was steadily and surely
slipping away like sand.
I worked day and night,
grabbing onto every
passing grain; and the
more I focused on holding
onto one, the more the
rest slipped beyond my
vision. I was too blind to
see that the road I was to
take was of another colour
and, better yet, of another
world.
LESS!!
Less was the route I
should have taken em-
barking on my long and
arduous journey. Walk
slower, take it easier,
worry less! Less is the
mentality of a runner,
realising that a marathon
is not to be sprinted. Less,
declare the words of a
writer cutting down to
linguistic perfection. Less
flows the hand of an artist
sculpting a grand master-
piece to a fault of none.As
Antoine de Sant-Exupery
would say, “perfection is
achieved not when there
is nothing more to add,
but when there is nothing
left to take away.”
But one may ask, what
if I want to get there
faster? What if I want to
reach the end in half the
time? Is more not then
the solution? I never said
to work less, but rather to
worry less. As a sprinter
who trains to reach the
finish line quicker, so must
you first train your ability
to accept results as they
come in order to further
yourself. Focus not on
attaining more, as there is
simply too much out there
to be attained, but rather
on giving more, as that
is in plentiful abundance,
and how sweet the fruit
of the labour of giving.
Conquer, and there will
always be those who have
conquered more. Find,
and yet persists the fear
of losing. Give, however,
and you need never worry
about keeping. Give,
and you will effortlessly
be brought closer to the
things and ones you love.
Is that not truly why we
work?
need more resources I
hope #metoo can be an
occasion for the public
to realise that maybe we
should give that to them.
But the CJS still isn’t
perfect, and that’s where
Imperial comes into the
picture: for women, being
a full-time student in the
UK is associated with a
6.8% increased risk of
victimisation. I think both
Imperial College Union
and the College need to
play a role in making
Imperial safer.
Two years ago, Emi-
ly-Jane Cramphorn, our
former Deputy President
(Welfare), posted an
article called “Blurred
lines?” in which she
argues: “A lack of educa-
tion and discussion about
sex and consent sits at
the core of rape culture
and until we address this
nothing will change.” I
agree that open discussion
is crucial, but I think there
is a flaw in thinking like
this about rape culture:
It allows perpetrators to
argue that they “weren’t
educated on the fact that
it’s wrong to physically
attack others”, and it leads
to these traumatising
attacks being treated as
misunderstandings. An
attack is never a misun-
derstanding. Ignorance of
the law should never be
an excuse. According to
Lundy Bancroft, consult-
ant on domestic abuse,
author, and winner of
the 2004 Pro Humanitate
Literary Award:
“An abuser almost
never does anything that
he himself considers
morally unacceptable…
an abuser’s core problem
is that he has a distorted
sense of right and wrong”
Any abuser found
guilty by Imperial obvi-
ously needs to realise that
what they did was wrong,
but since Imperial is not
a prison, I do not believe
Imperial should ever act as
a correctional institution
e.g. by issuing consent
training. Expulsion is both
fairer and safer.
Don’t get me wrong:
I understand the utopian
dream as presented by
Cramphorn that education
will prevent a person from
doing wrong things in the
first place but preventing
a person’s first offence is
an incredibly complicated
issue. Given the scale
of the issue, and the
outrageous prevalence
of repeat offenders, let’s
start with what would also
have a great impact, but
would be much easier:
preventing subsequent
attacks from the same
person.
sexual advances, defined
as inappropriate touching
and groping. Imperial has
roughly 17000 students,
so one would expect
roughly 4420 Imperial
students to have experi-
enced such an incident.
A freedom of information
request revealed that the
number of sexual har-
assment/sexual assault/
rape complaints dealt
with by the College
between 2010–2017, in
total was 11. This would
lead us to believe that
roughly 0.25% of sexual
harassment/assault cases
are reported to Imperial.
Clearly there’s room for
improvement.
Law and policy change
at a societal level is diffi-
cult and cumbersome but
given the current state of
how the judicial system
handles sexual miscon-
duct, I don’t think it’s
defensible for Imperial to
not take serious measures
to curb these crimes
from happening on their
grounds by their students.
A frequently cited reason
for not reporting such
a crime to the police is
that they “didn’t think
the police could do
much to help”. I think
Imperial should imple-
ment a system so good
at dealing with sexual
harassment and assault
that any Imperial student
who doesn’t believe in
the police’s ability to
help them will go to the
College instead. A system
so good that no Imperial
student will ever think of
such a crime as being “too
trivial to report”: a barrier
identified in the recent
sexual assault and consent
survey at Imperial. I hope
Imperial will consider the
following:
• Implement an
anonymous reporting
system equivalent to the
one already available for
Imperial staff. Students
don’t want to be harassed,
discriminated or bullied
either.
• Disallow the
Union from handling
cases involving sexual
misconduct since only
the College can expel
students. This would
prevent serious cases from
ever being passed back
and forth between the
Union and the College,
thus curbing distress.
Currently, under 17%
of the Imperial Student
Disciplinary Procedure
from 2017, the Union
is “expected” to let the
College deal with serious
incidents on Union
grounds, but I think these
cases should be handed
over by default, not by
expectation.
• Accountability:
Tangible and public
promises. I think Imperial
should issue a promise
of how quickly they will
resolve cases. This could
be of the form “confir-
mation receipt of your
complaint within 24hr”
and “completion of X type
of case within Y months.”
This will give victims an
idea of what to expect
from the College and give
the entirety of the student
body tangible metrics to
hold the College proce-
dural system accountable
to.

it’s reasonable
for Imperial
to not take
serious
measures to
prevent these
