T
o start the year
with an absolute
bang, IC Netball
went to Brighton
for one epic weekend
consisting of a side of
netball and LOTS OF
SESH. After a day’s grind
at Imperial, the netball
girls set off to Brighton
by train and arrived in
time for a solid night out
at Coalition. Good news:
we did not cause too
much havoc on the train
ride there, but can confirm
the night was absolutely
hectic. Dance moves
came out and drinks were
flying – all in all a great
night out ending with a
breezy walk alongside
Brighton Pier and cheesy/
curry chips (or in the case
of Liv, a whole haddock
and fries) to satisfy our
stomachs. After all, did
you even go to Brighton if
you didn’t get post-night
fish and chips?
Feeling robbed of our
six pounds spent on chips,
we got up bright and early
the next day and headed
down to the local Spoons
– a classic really. Brunch
was strong and absolutely
essential (for most),
before we headed down to
the Manor for two hours
of netball. Let’s just say
not everyone was in their
best form, but there was
still some decent play
throughout! Though we
definitely had some spec-
tators sleeping/recovering
from the night before’s
damage on the sidelines.
Winners took home a
hefty bottle of prosecco,
ready for another night
of carnage at Pryzym.
After an hour and a half of
netball, the UK weather
decided to take a turn as
per, and it wasn’t long
before we were drenched
and desperate to jump
into our Ubers back to
our ‘luxury’ hostel. We
spent the rest of the day
chilling and spending
our life’s savings in the

arcade, where we won a
billion lollipops and tacky
keychains.
back to the hostel for a
solid pre-sesh consisting
of tons of roasting and
absolute savagery in Mr
and Mrs and other group
games. To ball out in style,
we bagged ourselves a
fancy VIP table at Pryzym
and danced the night
away! Can confirm, we
were the youngest women
in the club but neverthe-
less, it was a great night.
Highlights of the night
include: Ellen getting
absolutely binned, Olivia
going to church at 2am to
pray for Ellen, and Emily
getting 100 pounds out of
the ATM for a serving of
chicken nuggets. These
were just a few of many.
All in all, we ended
the amazing bonding trip
with a big Sunday brunch
at an all American diner
before heading back to
gloomy London and to
resume our Imperial lives.
It definetely was a tour to
remember, and we are all
looking forward to next
year’s tour carnage!

n the run up toVarsity,
the 3s showed
fighting spirit and
cohesive team play in
their match against GKT.
Although it was a tough
match, with only seven
players and no subs and
GKT being higher in the
league than us – we were
the winning team with a
close score of 34-32. We
started the game well with
a 2-point score lead, with
defence showing consist-
ent fighting spirit, getting
many interceptions and
turnovers as well as centre
court and attack working
well together around the
D especially.
Although the 2nd
and
3rd
quarter were intense
and very fast paced, we
managed to maintain our
point lead throughout with
the player of the match
going to both defence (GD
and GK) – Emily Jones
and Ren Elvidge. Well
done to these girls who
played to a high standard
consistently throughout
the match, getting the
largest turnovers as of yet!
We hope to continue this
amazing match play in
hopes of taking home the
gold medal at varsity.
We even adventured
down the lanes of
Brighton, and definitely
treated ourselves to more
chips and churros. In
netball tradition, we all
headed to Pizza Express to
line our stomachs before
Pryzym. Absolutely nec-
essary. Then we headed
