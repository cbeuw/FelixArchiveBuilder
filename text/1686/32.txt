Imperial Squash regains the Roehampton Cup
16 universities entered the Roehampton Cup and Imperial comes out on top. Having the strongest 2nd team, and
the 1st team winning the cup.
L
ast weekend saw
Imperial Squash
return victori-
ous from the
Roehampton University
Cup. This highly prestig-
ious tournament, held at
the classy Roehampton
Club, is a highlight of
the squash calendar, and
featured teams from 16
universities.
On Saturday morning
we arrived fresh and
raring to go. Imperial
had entered both their 1st
and 2nd
teams. The 1st
team, made up of Puven
Subramaniam, James
McCouat, Patrick Brandl,
Pamela Hathway, and
Dave Newman stormed
through their group, pre-
vailing 5-0 over Bristol
2s, Southampton 2s, and
Leicester 2s. The 2nd
team, comprising of Tom
Readshaw, Sam Horne,
Andre Bharath, David
Anderle, and Francesca
Lim lost to Durham, but
a convincing win against
the Kings 2s saw them
progress, along with the
1st team, to the quarter-fi-
nals – the only university
2nd
team to do so.
Later that day there
was an exhibition match
between Daryl Selby
(former world no. 9) and
Robbie Temple, famous
for his two-handed
ambidextrous style- he
actually swaps his racket
hand during rallies. Our
very own Patrick Brandl
“From 2-10
Imperial claw
their way back
to a 15-14 win,
winning the
cup”
appeared to concede his
own pick-up and after
not hearing a call from
the referee, changed his
mind) and awarded the
point to the other player.
The players were both
confused and somewhat
reluctantly appreciative
of this unorthodox but
entertaining refereeing
style. The match proved
to be a hit with the players
and the crowd. It was a
fantastically entertaining
way to mark the half way
point of the tournament.
There was a formal dinner
provided after the match
and Daryl thanked Patrick
in his after dinner speech,
admitting he “very much
enjoyed his suspicious ref-
ereeing” , but not without
mentioning that he “got
the ball in question”.
After indulging in a few
group photos with Daryl,
and once Pamela Hathway
had finished catching up
with her former colleague
on the PSA world tour, the
Imperial teams retreated
for the night to rest up for
the following day’s big
matches.
The first fixture on
Sunday was an intriguing
one: an all Imperial affair
in the quarter-final. The
1s progressed through to
the semi-finals, but not
without the 2s putting up
a tough fight, providing
the sternest test so far of
the 1st team’s fitness and
technique. Imperial 2s
then faced the play-offs
for places 5-8. They
pushed LSE and King’s
1s right to the wire and
finished the tournament
comfortably the highest
placed 2nd team in the
competition – a superb
achievement.
In the semi-final, the
Imperial 1s team faced
defending champions
Leicester, who had
brought the same winning
team as last year. Imperial
had lost to them at the
semi-final stage in the
2017 edition of the tour-
nament, but this time they
stormed to a convincing
4-1 win. Everyone played
out of their skin, especial-
ly our number 1, Puven
Subramaniam, who beat
the Leicester number
1 (a PSA world ranked
player), in a match many
said was more exciting
than the exhibition match
the previous evening.
Revenge tasted almost
as good as the club sand-
wiches on offer in the
members’ bar.
In the final, Imperial
would come up against
a Surrey team brimming
with confidence after
cruising through the
rounds on their side of
the draw. Surrey’s team
were extremely tough
competition and despite
exceptionally brave
performances at 2nd and
4th
string, Imperial found
themselves 2-0 down and
strings, Patrick Brandl
and Dave Newman, took
to the court, each knowing
nothing short of a win
would suffice. It was a
tense affair: after drawing
level in his match, Dave
found himself 2-10 down
in the final game. What
followed was a truly
nail-biting comeback that
saw him win on a tense
sudden death point with
15-14 – nothing short of
a miracle. That’s why
we call him the iceman.
Spurred on by the cheers
from the crowd, now
flocking to see the conclu-
sion of his title deciding
encounter, Patrick found
some exceptional form in
the final game to win in
style against a very solid
opponent. Against all the
odds, it meant victory for
Imperial!
As a prize for winning
the tournament, Imperial
received a large glass
trophy, VIP tickets to the
Canary Wharf Squash
Classic, and a year’s
squash membership to
Roehampton Club. Fancy

the teams and maybe

title in 2019? Email us at

Fencing trav-
elled to Paris
to fence in the annual
Challenge X-Systra – a
student run fencing com-
petition held at the École
Polytechnique, including
individual and team
events, attracting fencers
(including national team
fencers) from all over
Europe. Everyone com-
peted in their respective
individual events on
Friday, fencing in pools,
then direct elimination
knock-out matches.
Highlights included Ailsa
and Peter finishing L16 in
women’s/men’s foil, Jesus
finishing L8 in men’s foil
and our favourite 2nd
year
Sherry finishing with a
bronze medal in women’s
sabre! The evening then
continued with abundant
wine and socialising in the
uni bar and games area.
Of course the Imperial
fencers wanted to make
the most of their trip, so
got the last bus back to
Sunday morning started
off with Filip up bright
and early for his 6.15am
bus to the venue. Unfortu-
nately, after falling asleep
on the bus, he found
himself coming all the
way back to the hotel and
met by the second wave of
fencers. Our men’s foilists
were also looking pretty
rough however that didn’t
stop Imperial having a
completely unexpected
but incredibly successful
day. Filip, Ailsa, Ben and
Sherry each teamed up
with fencers from other
universities, whilst we
had an all-Imperial men’s
foil and men’s sabre team.
Filip, Ailsa and Sherry’s
teams all breezed into
the finals, finishing 2nd
in
men’s epee, 2nd
(losing
43-45!) in women’s foil,
and Sherry added a team
gold to her medal collec-
tion!
Ben’s team and our
men’s sabreurs were
knocked out in the middle
stages of their events,
whilst our men’s foilists
were had won their
easier matches and were
somewhat waking up.
They continued winning
and made it through both
tough quarter and semi-fi-
nals! They were fencing
better than they ever had
and worked as a team.
With huge support from
the Imperial squad, they
eventually won the final
45-39 in a closely fought
match against UCL!
Massive congratulations
to Jesus, Javi and Peter.An
amazing day was finished
off with fireworks, a free
bar, dancing and snowball
fights and after an hour of
tourism on Sunday, and
around 14 hours sleep
each over the course of
the trip, the snoring on
the Eurostar home was
excusable.
Win-perial fencing: gold, silver, and bronze at BUCS
L
ast weekend, 26
fencers made
the trek up to
Sheffield to
compete in the BUCS
Nationals. On Friday,
seven of the fencers com-
peted in the Men’s Epee
and Women’s Sabre. In the
epee category, after initial
rankings Jake Reynolds
was ranked 3rd
but came
up against teammate Filip
Anies in the knockout
rounds. Filip won and
proceeded to the top eight,
where he met teammate
James Odgers; the match
was close, but James
won, taking him to the
semi-finals where he went
on to win a bronze medal
– particularly impressive
as he was recovering
from injury. In Women’s
Sabre, Niamh was ranked
24th
after initial rounds
but battled her way to
the quarter finals. Overall
result: James Odgers 3rd
(Bronze Medal), Filip
Anies 8th
, Niamh Spence
8th
, Jake Reynolds, 17th
,
Sherry Xu 31st
, Louis
Jennings 45th

early, and in the first round
of knockouts, two team-
mates, Francesca Cavallo
and Ailsa Morrison,
faced each other. After
a tough match, Ailsa
won and made it all the
way to the top 16. Men’s
Sabre followed shortly
after, with top 64 place-
ments achieved by Chris
Erickson and Filip Anies.
Overall Result: Ailsa
Morrison 16th

, Frances-
ca Cavallo 40th
, Chris

and
Raymond Wang 81st
.
On Sunday, it was
Men’s foil and Women’s
Epee turn. Francesca
Cavallo was ranked 11th
after the first round but
fought every knockout
round with amazing
determination and made
it to the semifinals, which
was a very close match
but she pushed through
to win 15-14. The finals
were close and Francesca
fought hard but sadly lost
15-12, resulting in a silver
medal overall. In Men’s
foil after the initial rounds,
Guillermo Delberge was
ranked 3rd
but then faced
a tough knockout run.
He stayed determined
and worked very hard,
qualifying for semi-finals.
It was close, but he went
on to win 15-13 and pro-
gressed into the finals. The
finals match was tense and
started as a close match,
but Guillermo pulled
ahead, winning 15-9 and
hence winning the com-
petition. Overall result:
Guillermo Delberge 1st
(Gold), Francesca Cavallo
2nd
(Silver), Peter Udvardi
32nd
, Caroline Colagrossi
41st
and Georgie Stroud
49th

and Ben Fry 133rd

Congratulations to
the entire squad who
travelled up, there was an
overwhelming amount of
hard work, determination
and support. Up next for
fencing are the BUCS
team championships
with several of our teams
heading for a medal!
