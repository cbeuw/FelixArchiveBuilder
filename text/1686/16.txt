peaking at a con-
ference on modern
language in 1977,
in a speech that
would later be published
as The Transformation of
Silence into Language and
Action, the poet-activist
Audre Lorde reckoned
with her mortality.
A few weeks prior, she
said, she’d undergone a
mastectomy to remove
a tumour that in the end
turned out to be benign,
but in the three weeks it
had taken for the results
to come back, the “final
silence” of death had
seemed all too imminent.
“I was going to die, if not
sooner then later, whether
or not I had ever spoken”
she remarked, “my
silences had not protected
me. Your silence will
not protect you. But for
every real word spoken,
for every attempt I had
ever made to speak those
truths for which I am
still seeking, I had made
contact with other women
while we examined the
words to fit a world in
which we all believed,
bridging our differences.
And it was the concern
and caring of all those
women which gave me
strength and enabled me
to scrutinize the essentials
of my living.”
This confessional call-
to-arms - at once bold
and vulnerable - was the
reiteration of a lifetime’s
philosophy for Lorde,
whose essays and poetry
had established her as a
vital and necessary voice
at the forefront of the
intersectional feminist
movement.
Thrillingly, Lorde’s
writing demands nothing
less than utter revolution:
critiquing not only the
patriarchal, heteronorma-
tive society that oppresses
women, but also exam-
ining what she regarded
to be the false principles
within feminism. Rather
than rejecting the terms
and philosophies that are
often weaponized against
women, she reclaims
them.
In her essay Uses of
“Thrillingly,
Lorde’s writing
demands
nothing less
than utter
revolution”
“Lorde’s
poetry is angry
yet what draws
the reader
back is an
undercurrent
of hope”
the Erotic, Lorde un-
tangles eroticism from
pornography, which
“emphasises sensation
without feeling”, and
elevates it to the spiritual.
“Recognising the power
of the erotic...can give
us the energy to pursue
genuine change” writes
Lorde, concluding that
such a thing would never
be possible “within the
context of male models of
power”.
Her 1979 essay The
Master’s Tools Will Never
Dismantle the Master’s
House is a further explo-
ration of the idea that a
complete overhaul is nec-
essary. Written to express
her disappointment at the
lack of inclusion of black
and lesbian women in
feminist conferences, in
the essay she forcefully
decries white feminism
- accusing it of being too
academic, too wilfully
ignorant of poor women,
of women of colour and
their issues, too reliant on
the power structures of the
patriarchy to defend their
exclusions.
She returns to the issue
in Age, Race, Class and
Sex - “by and large within
the women’s movement
there is a pretense to a
homogeneity of experi-
ence covered by the word
‘sisterhood’ that does not
in fact exist”. Throughout
her work, Lorde calls
on the reader to reject a
system that disregards
divergent experiences,
reject “cosmetic changes”
and build one that cel-
ebrates differences: “in
our world” she implores,
“divide and conquer
must become define and
empower”.
The immediacy of
Lorde’s call for greater
inclusion must in part
arise from her own life:
for her, the political was
intensely personal. As a
“black lesbian feminist
socialist mother of two,
including one boy, and a
member of an interracial
couple” Lorde cannot
help but be inclusive, it
keeps her “honest” - the
complexities of which
she brilliantly describes
in an essay exploring the
challenges of raising a
boy as a lesbian mother in
Man Child.
In The Silence Will
Not Protect You, Silver
Press’ new edition of
Lorde’s work, her essays
are brought together
with some her poems.
Somewhere in the
middle of the slim pink
paperback is a transcript
of a conversation with
the poet Adrienne Rich.
This sweeping interview,
rich with detail, we learn
that prose never came
naturally to Lorde, who
expressed herself from an
early age through poetry.
Indeed her poems, packed
with punchy imagery
are a potent distillation
- reducing down pages
of prose into a short few
lines.
Good Mirrors Are
Not Cheap rehashes The
Master’s Tools: “It is a
waste of time hating a
mirror/or its reflection/
instead of stopping the
hand that makes glass
with distortions”.
Sometimes filled with
brutal imagery, Lorde’s
poetry is unflinchingly
angry and fearless: she is
not one to sugarcoat or
mince words, yet what
draws the reader back
is the undercurrent of
belief in a better future,
a skein of light that is
also threaded through
her prose. Hurled rocks,
barbed wire, and dogshit
dumped on the porch may
litter Outlines, a poem
about Lorde building a
life with Frances Clayton,
a white woman, but it
ends with love and hope:
“we have chosen each
other/and the edge of
each other’s battles/is the
same/if we win/there is no
telling”.
