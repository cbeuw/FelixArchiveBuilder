BANGLADESHI
SOCIETY –
REMEMBERING
OUR HISTORY
Whenmostpeoplethink
of Bangladesh, they think
of “that small country
next to India”. What most
people don’t know is that
Bangladesh is a country
full of rich history and
culture, despite only being
47-years-old this year.
Initially it was recognised
as ‘East Pakistan’ after
the British rule ended,
but the people of East
Pakistan wanted inde-
pendence. International
Mother Language Day is
officially held on the 21st
of February. This is to rec-
ognise the 1952 language
movement of Bangladesh,
which involved the death
of Bangladeshi University
students for campaigning
the right to speak Bengali.
Bangladesh was founded
in March 1971, after the
Bangladeshi liberation
war, or ‘Muktijuddho’.
This saw the death of over
500,000 people, although
nobody knows the exact
number and Bangladesh
Government figures
suggest this number can
IC RADIO –
COME AND GET
INVOLVED!
Are you in a band?
Want to get more
exposure? ICRadio has
be as high as three million.
As young British
Bangladeshis, this tragic
past serves as a constant
reminder to appreciate
our heritage. In honour of
this, Imperial’s very own
Bangladeshi Society have
held a range of events to
commemorate the wars.
On the week starting 19th
February, we held several
stalls and exhibitions to
educate other students
on this history. As part of
these stalls, we created a
banner for students to per-
sonalise with their names
in their own languages.
This banner was then
taken to Altab Ali park, on
the 21st
February, where
Imperial was joined by
Bangladeshi societies
from other universities.
Everyone came together
to pay respects to students
who lost their lives for
our language, and other
fighters who fought for
independence. Our final
flagship event ‘Anuprani-
to’, meaning ‘To Inspire’
was held as means to
connect our extraordinary
history to a future that
holds a lot of potential. A
range of Bengali speakers
from various fields were
brought in to discuss
their success and inspire
students both Bangladeshi
and non-Bangladeshi
alike.
Perhaps the most
rewarding aspect of all
the events, is that all pro-
ceedings will be donated
to JAAGO, a charity
that supports educational
projects in Bangladesh
while also providing
opportunities for UK
students to volunteer in
Bangladesh.
We hope this week has
been a chance for you to
learn about the history of
Bangladesh and not just
“that small country next
to India”. As for those
of you who missed the
exhibitions, stay tuned for
more BanglaSoc events
where you can learn all
about Bangladesh and its
amazing culture.
Simran Mahmud
started streaming bands
live from the Jazz and
Rock room in the West
Basement from 8pm to
9pm on Thursdays, and
we’re looking for bands
to come on and play! The
IC sessions are a great
opportunity for your band
to get some exposure, as
well as the practice gigs
without the pressure of an
audience in front of you.
We don’t discriminate on
genres, so whether you
play metal, funk, jazz,
pop, covers or original
material we’ll be happy to
have you on. We’ve had
four shows so far and it’s
great fun for both the band
and for us, the presenters
and sound engineers.
Want to record some
songs? We can now
record your band (for
free!) and either give you
the multi-track for you to
mix and master yourself,
or we can do it ourselves
for a fee. This is done
based on when our sound
engineers have time – we
are still Imperial students
after all!
Not in a band? You can
still get involved! We’re
looking for people who
are interested in sound
engineering and want to
learn how to record and
stream bands or even how
to mix and master tracks
in a post production envi-
ronment. If you’ve been to
the West Basement, you’ll
have seen all the shiny kit
we have, which too few
people know how to use,
sadly. That’s why we’re
looking for anyone with
any sound experience or
who is just very eager to
learn to get involved.
Just want to do a normal
radio show? Go for it!
While getting shows at
other student radios can
be difficult, at ICRadio
its really easy – just ask
and we’ll give you a
slot. We don’t place any
restrictions on what you
do on air (other than no
swearing), meaning you
are free to do whatever
you want and talk about
any subject that takes your
fancy. Of course, you’re
still streaming live on the
internet (and all shows are
recorded), so be sensible!
Interested in IT?
We’re currently looking
for people interested in
becoming our next IT
manager. Exactly how
we stream Radio and
schedule shows involves
a decent amount of black
magic which is absolutely
essential to our society
functioning, so if you want
to get some practical ex-
perience with web pages,
server maintenance, or
Linux audio let us know!
ICRadio is a really fun
society to get involved
with, so don’t hesitate to
do so. If you’re not that
interested (a concept I
find hard to fathom), you
can always listen to us at
icradio.com.
For requests to play
live on the radio, email
manager@icradio.com
with the subject ‘IC
Sessions’. If you want
to get involved with
production or want to
record some songs, email
production@icradio.com.
If you want to start your
own show, email micheal.
hain16@imperial.ac.uk
for training and then
talk to programming@
icradio.com to get your
weekly show slot. Pro-
spective IT managers

RAINCATCHER
IMPERIAL –
HELPING CHANGE
LIVES AROUND THE
WORLD
The sky is still dark
when Christina leaves the
house. She lives with her
family in a small village,
where more than half a
year may pass without a
drop of rain. During these
dry spells, it is her daily
job to fetch more than
twenty litres of water from
a creek four hours away.
She wants to go to school,
but cannot, because she
has to walk so far to
gather water. Christina is
only ten.
There are many
children like Christina
in the rural villages of
Tanzania. The climate
of Tanzania has a pitiful
annual rainfall, hence
water scarcity is one of the
greatest problems faced
by the local community.
This is where we enter the
story.
Founded in 2002 by
two Imperial students,
the student-led charity
Raincatcher Imperial has
since completed 14 major
summer projects and
clocked over 12,096 hours
in Tanzania. We have con-
structed numerous rainwa-
ter harvesting systems and
provided essential water
and sanitation training
all around Tabora. More
than two million litres of
rainwater harvesting ca-
pabilities have been built,
benefiting thousands of
rural villagers, essentially
removing the arduous trip
Christina and the other
countless children have to
take daily.
This year, we are
moving our focus to
Zeze, a rural village in
the Kasulu district of
Tanzania. After extensive
research, boreholes have
been identified to be more
effective than rainwater
harvesting to solve water
scarcity (And no, we
will not be changing
our name to Boreholer
Imperial). Therefore,
in the coming summer,
we will be spending up
to eight weeks in Zeze
constructing boreholes
with the local community.
Furthermore, we will set
up locally-sourced, sus-
tainable bio-sand filters
and, conduct hygiene
and microfinance courses
for the local people. We
might even hold a science
camp for the local school!
Before travelling to
Zeze, we are organising
fundraising events and
applying for sponsorships
throughout the whole
year to fund our research
and summer trip. Our
upcoming fundraising
event is the absolute
highlight of the year, the
annual Water Walk!
Water Walk 2018 will
be held on the 3rd
March,
to commemorate the
UN World Water Day, in
advance. In order to raise
awareness of water related
issues in Tanzania, we
will be carrying ten litres
of water each and walking
ten miles across Central
London. Participants will
get a taste of what the daily
water collection trek feels
like. All our fundraising
events are open to public,
so feel free to get involved
with your friends, family,
neighbours, and pets!
Walk for water, vol-
unteer for water. In order
to achieve our goals, we
need your help. If you
are interested in what we
do, you can follow us on
Facebook or come down
to our meetings every
Tuesday. We welcome
any new members! Stay
tuned for more informa-
tion on our summer trip
to Tanzania and see you
there!
