his week saw
lectures and
tutorials can-
celled, as uni-
versity staff across the
UK began their walkout
over pension pay.
Members of the Uni-
versity and College Union
(UCU) across 64 higher
education institutions
went on strike of Thursday
and Friday of this week. It
marks the first two days
of escalating strike action,
which could extend to
14 days in total, and is
estimated to affect over
a million students across
the country.
Imperial staff and stu-
dents assembled at 7.30am
on picket lines at key
entrances to the College,
including outside the
Royal School of Mines,
the Imperial College Road
entrance, and the Huxley
Building. Many of the
staff taking part in the
picket carried signs saying
“Hands off our pensions”,
and handed out leaflets to
staff and students entering
the College. The Imperial
branch of UCU estimate
that picket lines were
joined by at least 50 of
their membership, which
has increased to more
than 600 members since
the dispute over pensions
began.

moved down to the en-
trance to Imperial College
Road, where a number of
speeches were made.
Roddy Slorach, a
representative of UCU,
told the assembled crowd
the strike was “not just to
defend our pensions, but
to defend an education
service that is worth
having for all of us.” He
said they were “fighting
for the future of education,
for future generation that
wants a system that works
for everybody.”
Students then moved
to Dalby Court and 170
Queen’s Gate – where Im-
perial PresidentAlice Gast
is provided an apartment
– and wrote messages of
support for staff in chalk,
while watched by staff in
the Faculty Building.
A number of stu-
dents across different
departments turned out
to support the strike. A
Facebook event, “Stand
with our Staff”, which
invited students to join
the picket line, had nearly
250 people interested and
attending.
Thomas Cross, a first-
year aeronautical engi-
neering student, and editor
of College and City Guild
(CGCU) publication The
Bolt, was present at the
picket line. He told Felix:
“I’m here to represent
the CGCU, because as a
constituent union we’ve
decided to follow our
fellow members, and ICU
as a whole, in support of
