Sawrey's a very long way from IC,
but it has showers, a piano and
nearby mountains, so we went
there anyway. After a leisurely six-
hour drive up the M6, we arrived
at about lam and sprawled in
heaps all over the floor. Awak-
ened on Saturday by the welcome
smell of breakfast, we decided to
split into two groups: the more
experienced members to find a
grade three scramble up St Sun-
day Crag in Patterdale; the others
(ably led by Pudding Officer Mal-
let) to stroll (stride?) along Strid-
ing Edge and up Helvellyn.
Taking a shortcut, the scram-
blers ably wheezed up about a
thousand feet of 45 degree grass
to the actual craggy bit of the hill.
Easily negotiating the incompe-
tent fools making up other parties
they soloed their way to the top in
an irritatingly short (but amusing)
twenty minutes, delayed only by
Steve and Jeremy's (successful)
roped attempt to haul themselves
up a Severe pitch just off the
route. The number of other par-
ties around made traditional
climbing calls between leader and
second ambiguous, so they pio-
neered the use of (extremely) ran-
dom quotes from Round songs:
cries of "I like bananas because
they have no bones" and "Potato
Waffles" echoed around Pat-
te rdale.
Meanwhile, the striders were
being hauled inexorably at break-
neck pace along Striding Edge by
Mallet (this is the man whose idea
of a little run involves thirty miles
and ten major peaks...). Reaching
the top of Helvellyn in record
time, and undeterred by a hori-
zontal hail-storm (and, he claims,
flying fish fingers), the long-suffer-
ing other members of the party
were persuaded to just wander
down Glenridding and then up to
Stick's Pass and then...
Back at the hut that night,
Mallet put on his Pudding Offi-
cer's hat and sprang into action.
In less than no time a six-course
meal for twice the number of peo-
ple on the trip was on the table
(really - I'd list them, but there
were too many). An hour later, the
six-course meal was still on the
table, club members having spent
the intervening time alternately
eating, rolling around the floor
moaning (generally about the
seafood in the paella) and mak-
ing remarks along the lines of
"Never again!" and "OK, this is
getting ****ing stupid." That
done, we all pissed off down the
pub to throw darts at each other.
Sunday morning. Six profes-
sional maniacs jumped at the
chance to indulge their Neoprene
fetishes by donning wetsuits and
climbing into canoes; the rest
took a car over to Coniston to do
some more scrambling. After a
half hour drive and half an hour
working out how to put the
canoes together in the pouring
rain, the canoeists found the right
river and paddled away down-
stream. After an uneventful trip
across Rydal Water, we had three
miles of flooded river, white
water, low branches and our own
lack of skill to negotiate. Casual-
ties: minor branch-induced bruis-
es all round, two rubber mallets,
one hat, and a nice ninety degree
bend in the supporting poles of
one of the canoes (hitting things
head on at full speed is bad,
Jeremy). Reaching Windermere
just as the weather got bad
enough to stop the ferries, we
went across to a nearby bank for
lunch and a piss. We then had to
decide how to get back to the
minibus, left five miles upstream.
Eventually, half of us paddled
back over to Ambleside and Andy
legged it from there.
The weekend's fun was far
from over, mind you. That after-
noon, just as Mallet was serving
up a second six-course meal from
the remnants of the first, a menu
from the nearby Sawrey Hotel
appeared mysteriously with an
SOS written on it: lan's car had
conked out when he tried to take
it through two feet of water ("It's a
diesel! It's waterproof! Look..."),
and five members were stranded
in the middle of nowhere. Steve

Tuesday November 30th was the
occasion of the inaugural concert
of a new Imperial College-based
chamber choir, Canto Vilianella.
Despite choosing one of the more
unusual performance venues in
college - the balcony above the
entrance to the BMS - the event
was well-received by a large and
appreciative audience.
The programme was a mix of
old and new, from early music by
Byrd and Tye and arrangements of
English folk songs by Hoist and
Vaughan Williams, to Cole
Porter's 'Let's do it' and Youman's
'Tea for two'. The half hour long
performance attracted comments
ranging from 'Excellent - this choir
can really sing' to 'could we have
this every week'. Despite there
being only ten singers, the choir
projected well, whilst each of the
voice parts blended together.
sped to the rescue in the van, and
Damo, Ian and the car went home
on the back of a breakdown truck.

The group both further
enhances and adds an extra
dimension to the already strong
music at Imperial College. The
concert took place in the same
week as that of the Imperial Col-
lege Symphony Orchestra, in
which many of the singers already
play. The choir already has firm
plans to record their first CD in
February, has a number of other
high-profile performances lined-
up over the coming weeks, and
also hopes to sing at both func-
tions and receptions.
Their well-received debut will
be followed up by a performance
of Christmas carols in the BMS
foyer on the last day of term, Fri-
day 17th December, at 1pm. The
choir can be contacted by e-mail
at the address below.
