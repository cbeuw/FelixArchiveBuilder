The State of the Union
Christmas is finally nearly here. I'd
better make this a good one, as it
could be the last for sometime
given the number of College sys-
tems which run off elderly comput-
ers - we may all be having an
unexpected holiday! I have decid-
ed to ignore the political updates
and go with some of things I
haven't had a chance to put in thus
far.
Did we all notice the by-elec-
tion come and go? Have to say I
had completely forgotten until I got
a phone call from the Sunday
Spod, asking me if I wanted to get
my [breasts] out to celebrate. (No,
I didn't, by the way.)
In late October I went into the
ladies loos in the west wing, the
ones quite a long way from every-
thing, and knocked on the door of
a cubicle which had been quiet for
some time. To my mild amusement,
when I looked through the window
I could make out two people, one
dressed, one partially dressed. I
barely had time to think to myself,
what kind of person takes their
clothes off for liaisons in a public
loo, when a hand shot out to cover

the glass. 'Hello', I said, 'Are you
alright?' 'I'm being sick' came the
reply. By now I was looking under
the door where I saw one pair of
shoes and one pair of socks. (What
kind of person takes their shoes off
- just how long had they been
here?) 'What are you doing?' she
asked me! 'I'm wondering who
you're with.' I replied. 'My hus-
band'. So I left them to get dressed
and waited until they came out. I
asked for ID and, to my amuse-
ment where it so often says student,
this time it said staff. How interest-
ing! Wishing to be PC, the Union

manager and I asked her to come
in for a 'chat'. The letter came
back to sender. It turns out that this
woman had left College two
months before (there is no record
of her ever being married or
engaged). Of course, we never
knew who the bloke was
Most of my brainpower in heat-
ed meetings goes on not using four
letter words. These are often
replaced by five letter alternatives. I
was at one such bigwig meeting,
enthusing away about student
rights and the Union being poor,
when the chairman took a question
from one bigwig present. He asked
simply if the Union President could
explain what she meant by '...the
idea being a pile of pants'. Of
course this is not a one-way thing -
one bigwig, expressing concern
that the College could be persuad-
ed to go in the wrong direction,
declared he did not want to be
'sucked off in that fashion'.
Drugs are a very serious issue,
until the Union sends a guy called
Joynt to the committee (97-98), or
a chap called Weed is in trouble
(another Uni). Perhaps the RSM
president would like to get involved
- are you free Mr Cockayne?
And finally, thanks go to the
CCS for their help over the sum-
mer. I phoned them to help me
access my email - it responded not
and I didn't know that I could get it
over the net. Having explained,
over the phone, that I could not get
my email, I waited while he con-
ferred with a colleague. Eventually
they said 'Could you email us a
problem report, so it goes into the
system?'
A very merry Christmas to you
all. Tasha.
Term may nearly be over and the
Carnival not far away.
Remember /CU is open after term
finishes. Help, advice, support,
information and representation is still
available during the vacation.
Walk in, call or email.
