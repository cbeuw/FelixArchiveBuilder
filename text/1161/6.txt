6 Interview Felix â€¢ 15 December 1999
"Thank God, you know,
thank God for the pills.
Taslima Khan attempts to come to grips with the tragi-comic genius of Jerry Sadowitz
" G O O D evening Moose-Fuckers!" I remem-
bered Jerry Sadowitz's infamous opening line
that greeted the Montreal Comedy Festival
audience as I waited outside his Camden Town
home.
Although most recognisable as the front
man on Channel 5's The People vs Jerry Sad-
owitz, Sadowitz is also an accomplished magi-
cian and stand-up comedian - his Bib and Bob
comedy sketch show (written with Logan Mur-
ray) happily destroys any equal opportunities
paragraph featured in job advertisements.
One of the sketches involves Sadowitz
being wheeled on stage as the paralysed actor
Christopher Reeve. He is then launched out of
his wheelchair wearing a red cape, in an
attempt to fly. "Bib and Bob is just a bit of fluff.
It's not artistic, but it reminds people that there
is more to comedy than being neat and tidy.
My only limitation is that there is a joke asso-
ciated with a sketch - otherwise it's just a
swear word or an action."
With all this in mind, Sadowitz at a dis-
tance is a disarming sight. C!ose-up, plainly
annoyed and wearing a pine green dressing
gown, he was frankly alarming. "Hi, erm, I've
come to interview you". Realisation dawned on
Sadowitz's face: "I've overslept! Come in. Can
you give me five minutes? I'll put some clothes
on."
I sat amid pi les of videos, CDs, playing cards
and magic books. Sadowitz reappeared
clothed: "Would you like some coffee? I'm
having one myself. Help yourself to food" he
said, gesticulating at the kitchen cupboards.
Sadowitz is 38. Born in New Jersey, USA,
he moved to Glasgow soon after. Further
