Win an Olympus voice recorder
The gadget
Question : what would every self-
respecting gadget-lover of the
next century want to be seen with?
Answer : the futuristic looking
Olympus V-90 digital voice
recorder - and it's here now.
Upholding it's creator's reputa-
tion as a maker of stylish products
for the digital world, this pocket-
sized wonder is other-worldly in
it's spacey, golden shell. The V-90
is so beautifully styled it begs to be
held.
This handy device has three
separate "folders" that can each
store ninety-nine individual
recordings, on a fully integrated
8MB memory chip. The V-90 can
hold from 33 minutes (in standard
mode) to an impressive 90 min-
utes (in long play mode) worth of
recordings.
The V-90's LCD panel shows
which folder is currently active
and indicates the date and time of
each recording. For the fast-
paced organiser user, the alarm
clock function is great for wake-
up calls and appointment
reminders. Better still, its voice
activation feature means no time-
wasting to select the function, as
the intelligent V-90 only records
when you speak, and doesn't
when you don't - clever, battery
saving and ultra-efficient.
Weighing in at under 45g, the
V-90 is perfectly pocket-sized, but
with technology that looks this
good, you won't want it hidden
under wraps for long. The V-90 is
available for just £99.99 (inc
VAT). For stockist details, call
0800 072 0070.
Why you want one . . . .
Point one: these items are damn-
ably cool. Point two: they'll happi-
ly record your lectures for you
whilst you do what lectures were
made for - ie catch up on some
sleep or tackle the Felix cross-
word. You can then take your
recording home and listen to your
lecture on fast forward (which has
the added bonus of making him
sound like a member of Alvin and
the Chipmunks.
Bring these two points togeth-
er, and you have the ultimate in
practical cool. No hassle, no
effort, no need to be awake (or
indeed sober, as the controls are
childishly simple).
How to get one
As mentioned earlier, these classy
pieces of kit are available from all
good high-street retailers™. How-
ever, those of you who are
strapped for cash (and who
aren't looking forward to a sud-
den rush of generosity form
Santa this year) may reel some-
what at the price tag. Fortunate-
ly, therefore, we have one to
give away to a lucky reader. All
you have to do to win is tell us,
in no more than fifty words, how
you'd use yours, and why you
should win.
Email your answers to
felix@ic.ac.uk before the end of
the millennium to be in with a
chance of winning - don't forget
to include your name, your
course and your year. The win-
ner will be announced in the first
edition of next term. Good luck,
and Merry Christmas!
Funmail says have a beer on us.co.uk!
Considering the frankly risible response to this
competition thus far, I feel it's only fair to offer
you a second chance to redeem yourself...
Funmail, the free web based email service
offering a selection of over 8000 domain
names (the bit after the @) to use as an email
address, challenges you to dream up weird
and wacky alcohol inspired domain names
and get plastered as your reward for doing so!
The best domain will be added to the exist-
ing Funmail sen/ice - check it out at www.fun-
mail.co.uk - so that everyone can benefit from
your creativity, and the winning creator will
receive a crate of beer with our e-thanks.
Funmail already offers you great addresses
for when you're drunk from
you@mashed.co.uk, you@pisshead.co.uk to
you@out-of-it.co.uk, but want some more
because, for some strange reason, university
students seem to be quite taken by them!
Send as many ideas for 'drunken' domain
names as you want to felix@ic.ac.uk, or drop
your suggestions into the Felix Office (in the
portacabins by the back of Physics, hidden
behind the liquid nitrogen tank).
The winner will be the person who comes
up with the most inventive domain name, as
chosen from the entries received by our Fun-
mai! panel. The prize is a crate of beer and the
honour of having your domain name added to
Funmail's fist.
And while you're about it, go to www.fun-
mail.co.uk and sign up now. Funmail offers
domain names to use as email addresses cov-
ering every mood, event and occasion. Email
just got more fun.
The Rules:
1.) The judge's decision is final
2.) The prize cannot be substituted
4.) Only registered students and staff of Impe-
rial College may enter the contest
