t RCS Union
Y
ou are sleeping during a
particularly interesting lec-
ture (aren't they all?) when,
all of a sudden things start to go
all wobbly and, before you have
time to reach for the Alka-Seltzer, a
mysterious figure with a gaudy
green cloak, an incredibly long
beard and (amazingly) even longer
toe-nails is standing in front of
you.
The mysterious, yet oddly
merry, stranger speaks: "Do not be
afraid."
"Oh dear," you think, "Christ
has been reborn and I'm going to
be commanded to go and take a
present to him."
"No," replies the figure, "I am
the Ghost of RCSU Past. I have
come to show you how RCS events
have been celebrated before, to
invoke a sense of nostalgia and
make you feel guilty so you come
to the next ones."
The ghost then takes your
hand (and stabs his nails into your
palms) and leads you through a
dark corridor which has miracu-
lously appeared under the seat two
rows in front of you. You gradually
regain your senses and see a
charming scene laid out in front of
you.
"Ah, the Freshers' Barbecue. I
remember it as though it were only
yesterday. The dreamy smells of
summer were still in the air, as was
the aroma of those free hamburg-
ers."
"Yes, happy days," replies the
ghost, "and look over there."
Your gaze wanders off to the
left where you see the serenely lit
Union Bar and the Freshers Bar
Night in full swing. More worrying-
ly, you see yourself swinging
around the room in an uncontrol-
lably happy frame of mind, after
consuming copious quantities of
free beer. Bearing this in mind, you
carefully ignore the Ghost of RCSU
Past (GORP) as he nods towards
the images of the Freshers Pub
Crawl and the South Ken Ten, and
move onto the Freshers Dinners.
"Wow, there I am, enjoying my
formal dinner - don't I look like an
idiot in that suit?. And there's
Theta, and the Dean, and all those
nice Freshers I met, like Bob
Hatchett. Poor old Bob. He was
frustrated that he couldn't get onto
the ICU football team. Thankfully,
he contacted the RCSU and learnt
about the RCS Football team, so
he joined up and they're doing
really well in the ULU league. If
only the other CCUs plucked up
the courage and took them on.
And over there is the Careers
Forum, where they explained to me
the best way to go about getting a
job."
"You'd better take a pause
now," interjected the GORR "or
your listeners will start to lose inter-
est."
Your view starts to wobble as
you see yourself on Jezebel, the
RCSU's fire engine, collecting
money for Mencap.
"But there's so much more.
There I am on the London-Brighton
Run. The President is about to fall
of the fire engine! Wake up Mr
President, sir!"
"He cannot hear you," says the
GORR Forgetting this you unsuc-
cessfully try to suppress a laugh as
the President is surprised to be
woken up - and even more sur-
prised to fall off and to be taken to
hospital. A copy of BroadSheet spi-
rals into view.
"Ah, I remember how Broad-
Sheet has kept me awake in lec-
tures, with its witty reviews and sci-
ence news. That £10 prize cross-
word has kept me amused for
hours and the free Christmas angel
(flat packed with instructions from
ICU Origami Club) was great fun.
You're really beginning to
enjoy yourself when suddenly the
light fades...
"You have now seen the past,"
says the GORP while fading out, "
and now you must face th..."
Almost immediately, a large
female form appears in front of
you. You carefully check to see if it
is indeed female. You decide to
reserve judgement.
"Welcome back to the pres-
ent," says the figure in a strangely
high pitched voice, "where I, the
Ghost of RCSU Present, am sup-
posed to show you how RCS events
are celebrated now. Unfortunately,
due to a slight miscalculation,
there aren't any events within the
next three days, which means my
bit is going to be quite short. Bye."
"Oh," you think, "but I may as
well ponder my involvement. Are
there any societies I can get
involved with? Could I send some-
thing to BroadSheet?"
Before you can continue any
further, another presence
becomes, er, present.
"Greetings," says the shadowy
figure in a hilariously bad evil
accent, "and welcome to the
future. Your future. You are about
to see what will happen if you stop
going to RCSU events."
"Ha..."
"Don't talk! Just watch. You
can ask questions later when I dis-
tribute the problem sheets."
The scene cuts to a swish hotel
where the RCS Annual Dinner is in
full flow (just like the wine).
"Notice, you are not there.
You're missing out on the disco,
the speeches, the mascots and the
revelry. And here, at the Academic
Affairs Forum - everyone is enjoy-
ing themselves, getting their prob-
lems sorted out, nibbling the nib-
bles, but where are you? In your
room. Alone. Friendless. Alienat-
ed."
"Ok, ok," you burst in, unable
to control yourself, "but what can I
do to stop this from happening to
me?"
"Isn't it obvious? Keep joining
in with the RCS events. Enjoy your-
self - it's your Union, so use it."
There is a flash of light and
you wake up. Suddenly everything
makes sense. You leap out of your
seat (much to the consternation of
the lecturer, who is unaccustomed
to displays of excitement during his
lecture), reach into your bag and
pull out a large lump of overripe
brie to distribute to those more
needy members of your class.
