It was a cold and stormy day as
the all conquering City & Guilds
took on the Miner's team. Thun-
der shook the field as the players
took the pitch, and the start of
the match was delayed as Dave
Gol chased Penguins off the
pitch...
Playing with the wind, C & G
dominated, especially in the for-
wards, where our clear weight
and strength advantage was
obvious. After a number of
knock-ons, the first of many tries
was scored as the forwards
crashed over for Howard to
touch down. Shortly after this, a
second try was added by Will
Stevens, as he belly flopped over
from a few metres out. Many tries
followed, and the rest of the half
was a scrappy affair with the
miners stealing just one oppor-
tunist try.
Guild's second half account
was opened by Akira, as the for-
wards showed their strength with
a 25m drive from a line-out. By
now the contest was over and
C&G turned on the style as Ally
Jefferies went over after an inspi-
rational dummy, only to be fol-
lowed up by a nicely worked
Dave Gol try. At this point Nipply
stepped up to drop kick a con-
version attempt. He missed.
Shortly afterwards he again
showed his kicking prowess,
punting the ball to the opposition
backwards (as usual).
C&G's final tally was an
embarrassment, and with the
game rapidly becoming pointless
the ball was intercepted inside
the 22 after a no look pass. The
miners started crying so we gave
them a conciliation try at the
death.
Mixed results for mixed team stars

It was a good start to the week. The
IC players travelled a long way to
play Royal Holloway but returned
home with a huge grin on their
faces. It was a good solid perform-
ance which kept the opponents out
of the game the whole time.
Indeed, the result was never really
in doubt, thanks to the superior
ability of our players.
Courtney was killing the ball to
the opponent's court all the time;
Sandrine was like a defensive wall,
constantly stopping any attacking
attempt from RHUL (I think they
were getting annoyed with it...);
and Lucia got the MVP award due
to her brilliant display as a setter.
Then we had MariaJo in great
shape, together with the incredibly
consistent Phot and our two Con-
stantinos making sure the job
Mixed Volleyball
would get done. Special thanks to
Courtney - such dedication - and
her family who came to support the
team (all the way from the States).
UCL
IC ...
OK, it had to happen sometime.
After a total of nine matches with-
out a loss, the club finally failed to
beat the opponent of the day. The
game was an incredibly close
affair, with three out of the five sets
being decided by the minimum
margin.
UCL brought a very strong
team, with some players perform-
ing at a level not usually seen in
mixed-team competitions. Never-
theless, our team fought hard - very
hard indeed. We won the first set
with no major difficulties, but then
they came back and got the two
that followed (the third set was
extremely close and could have
gone either way). Major tactical re-
organisation of the team was car-
ried out, and we clinched the fourth
set with relative ease. In the deci-
sive set, a series of unforced errors
on our behalf made the balance of
the match tip over to UCL's side,
with a final set score of 15-17. It
definitely wasn't fair, though, since
we were the better team - ask any-
one...
Never mind, the team played
well and clearly showed we have
reasons to be confident regarding
our future in this competition. In
particular, there was a spectacular
attacking display by the captain,
Constantinos, and some groovy
improvisation by Etienne, whose
imaginative setting kept the opposi-
tion on constant alert. Oh yes, I
almost forgot - a thousand thanks
to brave Magali who, despite being
terribly ill, still managed to come
and play the whole match for the
team (who needed her badly).
