Tuition fees threatened Medical Library relaid
SUNIL R A O
The run-up to Christmas should see
a bombshell dropped - at least as
far as university education is con-
cerned. The Cubie report is set to
strike a powerful blow against
tuition fees north of the border.
This report is expected to fea-
ture amongst its recommendations
(if the Consultation Papers pub-
lished by the committee are any-
thing to go by) the abolition of
tuition fees, the re-introduction of
grants, additional support for part-
time and graduate students,
chances to the means-testing sys-
tem, and increased loans for stu-
dents in Higher Education. The
committee has visited a number of
Scottish campuses and has
received hundreds of written
responses to its Consultation
Papers.
The publication of the report
will see Imperial College Union
joining forces with virtually every
other university in Britain - regard-
less of affiliation with the Aldwych
Group (the student unions of the
"better" unis) or the National Union
of Students (NUS) - in writing to
MPs, Downing Street and every
national newspaper. According to
ICU President Natasha Newton,
the letter will include text to the
effect that "given the findings of the
Cubie Report, we hereby request
an immediate enquiry into the cur-
rent fees and grants situation for
students hailing from England,
Wales and Northern Ireland".
While it is true that a similar
report has less of a chance of hav-
ing its recommendations operated
here in England (Scotland has very
few independent (private) schools
and the Liberal Democrats, who
have always campaigned against
tuition fees, have far less power
here) it does appear that the report
will still have significant repercus-
sions on the way student funding is
looked at here "down South". The
fourteen-member Cubie committee
has as its convener Andrew Cubie,
senior partner of leading Edin-
burgh commercial law firm Fyfe
Ireland WS and former chairman of
CBI Scotland (ironically one of the
bodies in favour of retaining tuition
fees).

Worries over the Charing Cross
library renovation, voiced at the Vice
Principal's Question Time last week,
appear to have been addressed by
the Feasibility Study Group.
Staff and students from Charing
Cross highlighted a number of
issues concerning the planned over-
haul and restructuring of the library
building. They felt that the new plans
would reduce access to reference
material, increase noise levels and
possibly disrupt students studying for
exams. Many were particularly con-
cerned with the lack of consultation
between the planning group and the
Charing Cross community, but there
has now been some positive
response from the students.
With these issues in mind the
Feasibility Study Group convened to
layout the plans for each floor. The
committee, made up of senior med-
ical professors, estates personnel,
contractors and the ICSM President,
decided that the majority of the
library would be housed on the sec-
ond floor. Made up of 151 work
places, the second floor facility will
include reference materials, a pho-
tocopying room, video workstations,
library offices and PCs. The first floor
will house a smaller section of the
library along with UMO and other
administrative offices. There are
also plans for two seminar rooms on
the concourse.
Worries about the reduced
number of PCs were allayed by the
fact the amount will increase. A
review of the desks dimensions
answered concerns about loss of
desk space and the problem of
increased noise levels was solved,
partially by the floor plans and par-
tially by soundproofing.
Retaining its common room, the
ground floor remains largely in tact,
on the other hand the lower ground
floor will be the new home to 70
networked PCs, a journals store,
four seminar rooms, a gym, and two
student Union rooms.
Becky England, the ICSM Presi-
dent described the new plans as
"fairly positive" and expressed her
intention to follow the development
of the plans carefully, and keep the
students informed of all develop-
ments.
East Meets West show trades on past successes
J A N N E N VAMADEVA
The cultural mixing point of the year
which promised to be all things
good from the East combined with
the best aspects of the West, resulted
in the annual East meets West show.
The show, organised by the Indian
Society, combined dance, music and
comedy in an exhilarating perform-
ance with a distinctive flavour and
style.
After an hour long delay, the
comperes announced the plan for
the evening with rousing jokes to
hype up the already raucous crowd.
The classic medic vs non-medic line,
though thoroughly over-used
amongst IC people, still managed to
get a rapturous reception from a sea
of vibrant colours and traditionally
dressed people.
The Indian Society attempted -
but did not truly manage - to merge
the two different (yet beautiful) cul-
tures. There would be a western act
followed by an Eastern act, but there
was no real mixing or fusion the two.
One would have hoped to see west-
ern music with a traditional Asian
dance such as Kathak or Bharat-
natyam. Surely that would show the
progressive nature of the East in
combining with Western tradition?
The traditional shows were all of
a high standard - in particular
Salman, Radhika and the dance
routine Bugaboo. But why so many?
One and a half hours to the interval
is too long, and there is no need to
do five versions of the same act. The
impact of the show was weakened
by the sheer volume of acts. It was
a pity that the highlight of the entire
show, a Michael Jackson imperson-
ator, was a dancer brought in and
not from the home-grown talent of
Imperial.
Next year, the Indian Society
should cut down on the number of
acts, while maintaining a cross-sec-
tion of entertainment. The show did
not really address the full breadth of
Asia's heritage, and there were no
oriental themes or bharatnatyam.
Moreover, the show might have
gained from the comperes allowing
it to flow smoothly rather than inter-
vening with their own brand of
humour.
The show, although good and
undeniably a success, can and
should be made more professional.
The aim of the organisers must be to
develop the show - then the annual
East meets West will truly be a spec-
tacular combination of two great
cultures.
