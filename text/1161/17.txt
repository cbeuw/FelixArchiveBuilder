THE M E A N I N G
O F CHRISTMAS...
Dear Dave
I finally felt intrigued enough
to reply to something that you
wrote about in Felix. Your editori-
al on the meaning of Christmas
was interesting if not anything
else.
Jesus Christ is an historical
figure. Whether or not you
believe that does not change that
fact. I would be interested to hear
how you feel you can prove that
Jesus never existed As to whether
or not you believe the claims that
he made about himself that is a
different fact, but there are very
few people who would like to
argue the point that he never
existed.
To ask the question as to why
the celebration of his birth is
important to this country (and the
world) shows a complete igno-
rance of the history of Christiani-
ty throughout the last 2000 years
and the effect that it has had on
world history. In the countries
where Islam and Judaism have
been important forces there are
social events surrounding the
respective Holy days.
Please tell me which majority
of the population do not believe
in Jesus Christ. Muslims, Hindus
and Christians all believe in Jesus
in one form or another. The fact
that the academic world has been
permeated by a naturalistic phi-
losophy of the world does not
mean that the majority of the
population believe it or that the
philosophy is correct.

To the editor,
It saddened me greatly to
read your statements in the edito-
rial about Christmas and the new
year.
The first thing that struck me
was that you wrote that Jesus was
a mythical figure. I can under-
Feedback
stand that some people do not
believe the claim of Jesus that he
was/is God. However, to claim
that he did not exist at all is to go
against all the evidence. I would
suggest that you not only read the
bible, but read some of the works
of Josephus, a first century secu-
lar historian who wrote about
Jesus and the following that he
had. This is a historical source
from the time!
I also found your remarks
about thanksgiving interesting.
Again I feel that you showed a
lack of knowledge about this fes-
tival as well. Thanksgiving was set
up by Abraham Lincoln to remind
the people of America what they
owed to God (the Christian God).
So here we have two festivals
that, at their fundamental level,
are about Jesus Christ, so to cel-
ebrate them any other way is to
remove the truth from them.
As for Christmas, what is it all
about?? One has to ask that if
Jesus was God, why did he
become human?
The answer is a humbling
one. It is that all the things that
we do that break the law of God,
every single one of them, are
deserving of death, and there is
nothing that WE can do about it.
But God did not want to leave us
in this state, and so, became a
man, one that did not break
God's law. He then died in our
place, paying the price for our
crimes. He then was resurrected
from the dead so that we can be
with him when we die, should we
choose to.
What everyone has to decide
is whether this is true, because if
it is, the consequences are huge.
It involves a massive choice
choose not to follow Christ, or
choose to follow Chist. This is not
something to be taken lightly, it is
the biggest choice that anyone
ever takes. I would suggest that
this Christmas, everyone should
think about what the whole thing
is about and make their decision,
Yours sincerely,
Andy Haden
Dear Sir,
I have just read your editorial
about the meaning of Christmas,
and felt compelled to reply. The
vast majority of historians would
disagree with you about your
belief that Jesus is a mythical fig-
ure, that is the equivalent of say-
ing that Julius Caesar or that your
great—grandfather are mythical
figures, there is plenty of evi-
dence outside the Bible itself that
verifies that Jesus Christ of
Nazareth lived and died on a
cross in Palestine 2000 years
ago. Where most people dispute
the reality of Christianity is not
over the existence of Jesus, but
over his resurrection, the fact that
he is God and furthermore, that
he is alive now. Christians believe
that there is enough evidence of
the resurrection of Christ to
believe what he said about him-
self, what he came to do and
what the future holds, and to put
their lives completely in his
hands.
I'd also like to say that I agree
with you that organised religion is
a very bad thing; it leads to ulti-
mate disillusionment, a perma-
nent treadmill and emptiness.
That is why Christianity is so
amazing; it is not an 'organised
religion' but about being involved
in a personal, loving relationship
with God Himself, through faith in
Christ. No other religion offers
this; all other religions have stan-
dards to meet and things to
achieve. Christianity asks for
none of this; there is nothing that
you have to do to know God and
enjoy all his blessings, except
repent of your disbelief and
believe! the consequences of your
choice are massive.
Christmas and Easter are
both celebrated the world over
and most people don't realise
what was really going on. The
world has distorted the true
meaning of Christmas into "Win-
terval", and Easter into choco-
late. Maybe subconsciously peo-
ple realise that Christmas is
important and needs to be cele-
