SOAS II 0
With the Christmas break fast
approaching, and 3 league games
and 1 cup tie still to play, we knew
we had to take the chance to estab-
lish ourselves at the top of Division
5. SOAS II started the day 3 points
behind us with a game in hand, so
it was a vital game to win - but we
went into the game missing a keep-
er and our long range expert, JR
Answering the call, however, was
Stuey Cook, back for another IC
appearance in goal - and later on in
the bar of course...
The game started in bright sun-
shine, and SOAS quickly got into
their stride, dominating the early
exchanges. We were forced to
defend, but the back four of Buzz,
Skippy, Sol and Tiger stifled the
attacks, and Dino and Vas up front
kept their defence wary. With about
half an hour gone, the ball fell to
softie at the edge of the box, and he
released a fierce shot towards goal,
which took two wicked deflections
before ending up in the net past a
stranded keeper. The weather then
took a turn for the worse, with freez-
ing rain and a strong wind, making
the rest of the half a non-event.
In the second half it was again
an even contest, although some
inspired substitution work almost left
us with an injured tiger and no-one
left to come on. And after taking a
boot in the nose, skippy shed more
than a little blood for the 5th team
cause. The second goal arrived with
20 mins or so to go; Dino won pos-
session on the half-way line and,
running on, left the SOAS defenders
in his wake. A cool shimmy sent the
keeper to ground, leaving Dino an
easy finish and his 12th goal of the
season.
So, 2-0 final score, which puts
us emphatically on top of the
league.
After getting up at some god
unearthly hour t ULU) men's team,
won the final UK marathon of this
millennium, albeit with the race
divided into three nine mile legs.
Yes, this was the Luton relay
marathon.
We travelled on the slowest train
in the world, with Frank Butcher
managing to disturb the rest of the
team by announcing that he had
managed to get a photo of a 1 4
year old girl and that he had nearly
gotten off with her 1 5 year old sis-
ter...
In freezing cold conditions and
with plenty of ice under foot, the
men's team's first ieg was run by
Imperial's Stan Ron. An unofficial
course record gave the second leg
runner, Imperial's XXX Gaffer, a 2
minute 26 second head start on the
rest of the field. The third leg runner,
Frank Butcher (from Imperial, natu-
rally) was given a 9 minute 45 sec-
ond head start over the next relay
team. Surely even Imperial's Cross
Country captain could not lose this?
Imperial, under the heading of ULU,
duly won by over 1 0 minutes.
There was also a female ULU
team, which again consisted mainly
of Imperial runners. Ruth (the only
non Imperial student) ran the first leg
of the day, producing a strong
result. She was followed by Sicky
Sarah who had to run and a new
find from Imperial, Gavina, who
managed to produce a time which is
probably a female course record.
Other than all of us being
knackered by 2pm on a Sunday, the
only significant news about the jour-
ney home was the fact that Sicky
Sarah informed to the whole team
(and her fiancee Daisy Boy) that she
was pregnant. Congratulations
guys, never thought you had it in
you mate!
All, in all, a very successful day
for ULU. What would they do with-
out Imperial?
IN BRIEF
Fourths Football
IC IV 4
RHUL IV 2
After a string of five defeats we
badly needed this win to lift our
spirit and to qualify for the next
round of BUSA. We started slowly,
and the first goal came from the
head of Justin, who soared miles
above the defence to open his
account for IC. Once again, how-
ever, we failed to hold our lead,
and Holloway equalised soon
afterwards.
An inspired substitution led to
our second and third soon after the
interval, and with some excellent
passing and rock solid defence
from new boys Pesh and Pooven,
the game was ours. Holloway did
pull one back, but we showed
great determination, remained
solid, and nearly got another,
thanks to some great work by
Nima. Eventually, however, it was
Kurt who finished the game off,
with a screamer into the corner to
make it 4-2. Great result.
Boat Club
The newly housed women's row-
ing team were out in force at the
British Indoor Rowing Champi-
onships last week.
Each event consists of a 2km
rowing machine race, and first
off were the Under 23's. Alison,
Caroline and Kelly ail set off
hard in the lightweight category,
with Alison leading the way to
victory and Caroline just missing
out on the silver. Meanwhile, in
the heavyweight class, Jessica
landed the bronze. A further
BUSA gold came from captain
Lindsey in the open lightweight
event, where she finished seventh
in a field containing some of the
country's top athletes.
Elsewhere last week, Alison,
Emma and Jess also romped
home with victory in the Senior 2
coxed 4's at the head of the river
race. Despite a raging head
wind and a severe crash during
the race, they still beat off the
Cambridge girls in a time of
23.02.22.
Womens Basketball
Once again, we hit a wall as we
played against King's (how did
UCL manage to beat them?); this
leaves us 3rd in the league.
However, we still have a chance
to grab the title if we beat UCL
next term.
As friendly as it was sup-
posed to be, the game against
Oxford was still very tense, espe-
cially when Dorothee, our top
scorer, rebounder and blocker,
had to leave the court after her
5th foul. Our defence remained
tight, but it was a more difficult
in attack, and Oxford started to
came back in the game - but
fortunately it was already too
late.
Well done and thanks to
everybody for their contribution
to this team - the commitment of
this year's piayers has improved
the achievement of team dra-
matically. A special thought for
Meredith, who was only at IC for
the autumn term and will not be
among us in 2000.

ICSM II 1
IC win 4-3 on penalty flicks
What a game - nailbiting stuff for
seventy minutes. We had the best
of the first half, constructing many
attacks and converting one of them
to go in 1-0 up at half-time. The
fire and passion of the first-half
continued into the second, and
when ICSM got a lucky equaliser
we rallied hard, but couldn't quite
find the target, and the game fin-
ished 1-1, sending it to penalties.
Five brave men stepped forward:
Jamie's went into the top left cor-
ner; Andy's top right; Paul's low
middle; Giles' low and crap; and
Tom tied it up, to leave the game
3-3 after the five. Up stepped Dr
Mong, facing sudden death, and a
heroic effort flew into the top cor-
ner of the net. The pressure was on
our makeshift goalie, Twat. The
flick was near perfect, he dived...
and with an outstretched stick he
edged it around the post. Hurrah!
