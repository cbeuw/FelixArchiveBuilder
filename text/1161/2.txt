Students in College accommodation
have been warned that, unless specif-
ically stated otherwise, they will not be
allowed to stay in halls over the mil-
lennium weekend - despite the fact
that their rooms have been paid for.
The Rectors Committee for Student
Residences (RCSR) have made this
decision based on fears of the possi-
ble failure of emergency services and
utilities, as well as the "greater risk of
health and safety issues" associated
with the turn of the millennium. Presi-
dent Tasha Newton explained "Over
the summer there was an idea from
College that all students should be
moved into one hall, to look after
them all in one place". That idea has
since been dropped by the RCSR and
it has been decided that people
should stay in their own hall, but
should explicitly state whether they
will be there or not.
Many students have expressed
concern over the fact that they will not
have the freedom of deciding at the
last minute whether or not they want
to stay in London during this period,
and there has been a suggestion that
College are in breech of contract on
the matter.
Questionnaires were distributed
to all halls in November, instructing
students to state 'yes' or 'no' as to
whether they will be staying in Halls
over the millennium weekend, of
which only an estimated 600-800
were returned.
Residences Manager Sharine
Brown stated in a letter to students
that "wardens have been instructed

not to grant permission for any guests
to be in Hall between 1 8.00 hours on
27th December 1 999 and 1 8.00 on
2nd January 2000". The letter went
on to say that failure to comply with
these terms will be considered a "dis-
ciplinary offence". Kevin Butcher,
Deputy President (Education & Wel-
fare) commented that "barring stu-
dents access to their rooms is unfair",
and the action is merely scare mon-
gering by the College to prevent too
many celebrating students staying in
Hall over the millennium period, and
thereby causing a heavy demand on
a depleted Warden and security serv-
ice.
A particular group affected has
been the international population,
who live a long way from home and
have not seen loved ones for some
time. One such student had arranged
in advance for his girlfriend to stay
with him in hall over the Christmas
holiday, and up until the Accommo-
dation Office stepped in, he was told
this would be fine. Confusion set in
when the letter was received, inform-
ing him that the guest would not be
allowed. After some distress, it was
established that as long as the matter
of deciding to stay in Halls is sorted
out locally (ie so the Wardens and
security of the Hall know you are
there), then there shouldn't be a prob-
lem. Mr Butcher explained "it is the
Union's job to tell students this".
Thankfully, that case has now been
sorted out, and the girlfriend can stay.
ICU is currently attempting to
rectify the mass confusion, and is try-
ing to let students know that as long
as the Wardens and security know,
they are well within rights to have
access to rooms.

C A M B R I D G E FAILED BY
INSPECTORATE
Leading teacher training institution
Homerton College, Cambridge,
has failed an inspection by the
schools standards watchdog, Ofst-
ed. The inspectorate said that two
out of six of Homerton's postgrad
training courses in physical educa-
tion were "poor".
BEER IS G O O D FOR
Y O U - IT'S OFFICIAL
Belgian scientists have found evi-
dence to suggest that teenagers'
consumption of soft drinks rather
than weak beer is linked to breast
cancer. The study, reported in New
Scientist, shows that levels of the
blood sugar regulating hormone
insulin rise rapidly after drinking
sugar-filled soft drinks, but not
after drinking weak (about 1%
alcohol by volume) beer, which
contains more complex carbohy-
drates. Inappropriate insulin
release during breast development
is thought to be involved in cancer,
although the mechanisms are cur-
rently speculative.
LEEDS AWARDED £20
FOR INNOVATION
Leeds University has been massive-
ly buoyed by an investment of £20
million from finance giant the For-
ward Group, deigned to help aca-
demics to commercialise new
ideas.
Alan Wilson, Leeds Vice Chan-
cellor, said he was thrilled with the
agreement, which had taken about
1 8 months to put together. A new
management structure will offer
dedicated expertise to academics
wanting to take their inventions to
the market.
RESEARCH: IS IT
REALLY W O R T H IT?
Vice Chancellors have asked
researchers to update a study of
the relationship between basic
research and economic perform-
ance, to further back-up their
demands for more cash from the
government. Although comprehen-
sive work was carried out by statis-
ticians at Sussex University in
1 996, these findings have now ben
seriously questioned, as they
apparently "over emphasised the
importance of the ability of basic
research to generate useful new
information".
