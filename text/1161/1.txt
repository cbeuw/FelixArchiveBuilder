Elite admissions oust the lower classes
FELIX NEWSTEAM
Imperial has continually reinforced
its position amongst the countries
elite institutions - and a new report
has revealed this can be largely
attributed to an elite intake.
Rankings placed IC second
worst in teh UK for bias against
state schools, with only 53 per cent
of its intake coming from compre-
hensives, just one percent more
than Cambridge. The ranking was
based an a projected figure which
was correlated to the A-Level
requirements of the intake. The
College fared no better in the class
stakes, ranking as the seventh most
socially exclusive higher education
institution with just 5.1% of its
intake coming from the poorest
neighbourhoods. However, as the
Government formulates its strategy
to tackle high drop-out rates, Impe-
rial has little to worry about with a
rate of only 3 per cent - a figure
being closely related to the high
entry requirements.
The figures, compiled by fund-
ing body HEFCE, are the results of
a socio-economic analysis of
admission figures for the 1997-98
academic year. They formed part of
Higher Education's first ever per-
formance indicators, and have
highlighted the apparent bound-
aries that those from less affluent
backgrounds face throughout uni-
versity education.
The average 27.4 A-Level point
score obtained by Imperial students
will undoubtedly affect the demo-
Student hardship for the new age
graphics of admissions according
to ICU President Tasha Newton.
Finding it difficult to identify a par-
ticular cause for IC's ranking (which
accounted for each institute's entry
qualifications) she stated, "A-Level
results are an established and fair
way of doing things and that means
certain groups will not be admitted,
but it is extremely concerning that
those from state schools are exclud-
ed."

and the schools liaison scheme as
major systems in their campaign to
attract the best students irrespective
of their background. Dr J Hassard,
the physics department's school
liaison officer explained "as far as
recruitment is concerned, I can
assure you that we neither discrimi-
nate against nor favour state
schools. We always go on ability".
Unfortunately, contrary to pop-
ular belief, Imperial may not be
doing its best in attracting the
widest range of the best students.
Dr Hassard explained: "We do our
best with open days and summer
schools, but we get a smaller per-
centage of respondents from state
schools than we'd like...We give
UCAS seminars - but we find some
private schools decline since they
run their own extensive and inten-
sive interview training, workshops
on filling in forms, guidance on
what counts.... which are probably
denied most to state sector pupils".
Dr Eastwood, Director of Plan-
ning and Management Information
Systems, who is involved with the
College's admissions, stated cate-
gorically that Imperial College cer-
tainly does not make it policy to
exclude anybody; it is open to all
who wish to come here and satisfy
the minimum scholastic require-
ments. He pointed out "The one
thing we will never do is lower our
admissions criteria. It would be
unfair to students if we did so - low-
ered entry standards might lead to
students struggling and eventually
dropping out", he stated, noting
that "we do well on drop-out rates.
When people come in, they stay
here to complete their degrees".
The Government are expecting
the Higher Education sector to take
action over areas of weakness
identified by the performance indi-
cators, Imperial College Rector,
Lord Oxburgh stated that "It is
entirely appropriate for government
to identify its priorities and for uni-
versities to respond, to the extent
that they do not compromise their
prime missions."
