Progress
Everybody
(Manifesto)
It is the song from the
advert, but I cannot
remember which one,
which says something
for the way the tune
subliminally sinks into
your brain. No doubt
it will be appearing on
every Ministry of Sound
album for 2 0 0 0 . Four
Charlatans
My Beautiful Friend
(Universal)
If I had a lead singer worse than that
of the Stone Roses, I certainly would-
n't ask them to sing a song this slow,
with so much emphasis on them.
However, Burgess manages to mould
with a guitar rift that could easily
carry the song by itself and for the
Charlatans the result is surprisingly
moving.
Type O Negative
Everything Dies
(Roadrunner
Taking a heavy metal band, slowing
down their verses by adding a piano
and over producing the song in an
effort to make it as consumer friend-
ly as possible is not the formula for
good music, as this song proves.
This is the work of very shoddy
workmen and to give it more than
zero would be unfair on the rest.

Agent Sumo
Sunflowers
(Seeds)
Agent Sumo proves to
more of a double-o
agent than a flabby
wrestler. This is a disco
house track that tacks a
bit of big beat on top.
The effect is excellent
as the beats get you
dancing. Watch out for
more of these guys in
N-lnfluence
Sweet Substance
(48K)
For those of you who
haven't quite got
enough of this through
the summer, here's a bit
more Euro House. It's
too late in the season
and there's nothing
remotely unique about
it. This is from an Oak-
enfold label as well
proving that even mas-
ters can mess up some-
times.
Tom Jones & Cerys
Baby, It's Cold Outside
(Gut)
It's a big question, and the ques-
tion is why? The pair decide to
take us back to a smoke filled
cabaret and no matter how good
they are individually the decision to
sing this song is almost as bad as
Cerys' dress in the video. Does
Jones just love the limelight, or
does he honestly believe that this
tune is worth singing?
TLC
Dear Lie
(Arista)
After their two successful singles
taken from their album Fan Mail,
TLC have opted for a ballad worthy
of the likes of Westlife and Boyzone.
They don't however have the fan
base of screaming girls and don't
drip with quite enough cheese. No
Scrubs is Felix's single of the year
though and Fan Mail is definitely
worth checking.
King Prawn
Your Worst Enemy
(Spitfire)
Given the name of the
band and the singles
packaging, I was
expecting another terri-
bly commercial attempt
at the number one sin-
gles spot, similar to Mr.
Blobby. Instead Green
Day have gone
extremely ska. It works
well, if you're into that
type of thing.
