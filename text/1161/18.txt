brated, but refuse to wonder why
and just have fun. A baby was
born in a stable in Bethlehem, the
Son of God, who came to save
every person who ever lived from
the deserved anger of God
against us all - we have all turned
away from him and dedicated
ourselves to other things; money?
ambition? sex? social standing?
He came 2000 years ago to save
you, dear reader, he is even now
knocking on the door of your
heart. This is the most important
decision anyone ever has to
make; do you choose life or do
you choose death?
I think it is probably fairly
obvious that I am a Christian
myself; if anyone wants to know
more you can contact me via
email (r.beal-preston@ic.ac.uk)
or come to a CU meeting on
Thursday evenings in Huxley, or
come along to our mission next
term and ask some questions!
Have a wonderful Christmas!
Yours sincerely,
Rosie
LET ME IN, LET M E IN
To whom it may concern,
Having consulted numerous
residents of Imperial College
Halls, there is a consensus of
unrest and frustration emerging
regarding the restrictions being
imposed on residents over the
Millennium period. Having been
obliged by our contracts to con-
tinue to pay rent over the Christ-
mas holiday period, despite the
fact that many people will be
returning home, it now transpires
that the normal conditions of our
rent are also being changed. It is
a shame that students are being
taken advantage of by being
made to pay rent over this peri-
od, whereas during the Easter
and Summer breaks, when the
halls can be readily let to other
students, there is no choice but to
clear out. This is not, however,
the major gripe of most residents,
merely a sad reflection of appar-
ent obsession, over and above
the welfare of the students, of the
College for financial gain.
The main concern of many
residents regards the change to
the conditions of rent during the
Millennium period for no appar-
ent reason. It transpired, unsur-
prisingly, that as many people
were interested in being in Lon-
don over the Millennium, the
halls were likely to be a lot fuller
than they usually are over the
Christmas holidays. So the Col-
lege, with pathetically poor wis-
dom and far too late for the
much needed foresight which
could have prevented all this,
hastily posted a rather blunt
questionairre. When exactly will
you, the resident, be in halls over
the Millennium period? Once this
data had been collated, one was
then informed that that no guests
would be allowed in halls over
the period 1800 hrs on 27th
December 1999 to 1800 hrs on
January 2nd! Perhaps it was too
much to assume that the relevant
body would realise that no one
wants to spend the Millennium
alone. Many of those who had
indicated that they would be here
wanted, unsurprisingly, to bring
guests. This is also leading to
bad feeling between students and
staff. Any students who do bring
guests will be subject to full Col-
lege disciplinary proceedings.
We have been hugely disap-
pointed by the apparent inepti-
tude displayed by whoever has
dealt with this. It is frankly laugh-
able and we think that those who
are "in control of the situation"
need to have a long hard think
about their handling of events.
We would suggest that perhaps
these measures have the very real
potential to cause far more harm
than good?
Yours, not at all threateningly,
Peter Harris & Jake Alexander
A N D FINALLY...
Dear all,
In return for being good little
boys and girls this year, you can all
expect very generous treatment at
Christmas, and an extra specially
large present on Christmas Day
itself. Make sure you keep up the
good behaviour next year, other-
wise no pressies for you...
