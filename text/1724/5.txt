raumatic Brain
Injury (TBI) is
the leading cause
of death and
disability for people aged
under 45 in developed
countries. The first ever
life-long study in mice
has found that head injury
effects can be halted by
xenon gas. Following
TBI, xenon prevented the
mice from early deaths,
improved their long-term
cognition, and protected
their brain tissue.
In TBI, a primary injury
is first caused by the initial
force from a fall or car
accident, for example, and
is followed by a second-
ary injury which develops
in the minutes, hours and
days afterwards. It is the
secondary injury that is
largely responsible for
the mental and physical
disabilities associated
with TBI - but there are
currently no specific drug
treatments that can be
given after the trauma to
stop TBI from develop-
ing. The only treatment
available is supportive
and rehabilitative. TBI
patients who survive the
injury have a reduced life
expectancy and an in-
Imperial College London
and Johannes Gutenberg
University Mainz have
found that the anaesthetic
drug xenon, given shortly
after a TBI, prevents
early death and long-term
cognitive impairment and
even protects the brain
tissue itself in mice. The
xenon-treated mice had
similar life expectancy,
cognitive function, and
brain tissue integrity to
mice that had never sus-
tained a TBI.
Previously, the same
team led by Dr Robert
Dickinson and colleagues
at Imperial’s Department
of Surgery and Cancer,
showed that xenon limited
early brain damage and
improved long-term
motor function in mice
with TBI, but longer term
effects were not yet inves-
tigated. Now for the first
time, the effects of xenon
over the whole lifespan of
mice has been observed,
in this study that was
published in the British
Journal of Anaesthesia.
Animals were
randomly allocated to
one of three groups: TBI
xenon, TBI control, and
healthy control. Under
general anaesthesia and
long-acting pain relief,
a controlled mechanical
force was applied to the
brains of the TBI control
and TBI xenon groups.
The healthy control group
was given anaesthesia, but
did not receive a TBI. The
researchers gave xenon
gas to one of these groups
(TBI xenon group), while
the other two received
control gas for the same
damage. Xenon treatment
shortly after TBI appeared
to prevent this. The TBI
control group were also
observed to have damage
in key brain areas involved
in cognitive functioning.
Xenon-treatment prevent-
ed or significantly reduced
this damage.
Xenon prevented the
loss of brain cells in the
hippocampus (an area of
the brain associated with
learning and memory),
and prevented degenera-
tion of nerve fibres in the
corpus callosum (which
connects the two brain
hemispheres). Xenon
was also shown to reduce
long-term brain inflam-
mation that is believed to
be involved in cognitive
impairment in Alzheim-
er’s Disease and other
dementias.
According to the
group, these findings
are important as they
could offer insight into
new treatments for TBI
patients, who currently do
not have any specific drug
treatments available.
Lead author of the
study, Dr Rita Cam-
pos-Pires, from the
Department of Surgery
& Cancer, said, “There
is currently a huge gap
in what treatment we can
offer to patients who’ve
suffered TBI - an injury
which can impact all areas
of their lives. Although
xenon has not yet been
tested for TBI in humans,
our findings add to the
growing body of evidence
that suggests it could be
used after head injuries to
prevent secondary injury
developing.
“Xenon appears to act
in a variety of ways, but
one of the most likely
mechanisms to explain its
protective effects on brain
tissue is by inhibiting re-
ceptors in the brain known
as NMDA receptors, that
become over-activated
following a brain injury.”
Dr Dickinson added:
“We have looked at very
long-term outcomes, up
to 20 months after TBI in
mice. This is very rarely
done in animal studies and
is equivalent to following
up human TBI patients
until their 80s. The
finding that only a short
treatment with xenon can
have beneficial effects on
cognition, survival, and
brain damage almost two
years later suggests that
xenon might in future
prevent cognitive decline
and improve survival in
human TBI patients.”
Xenon is already used
as a human general anaes-
thetic, is known to have
few side effects and could
be easily given via inha-
lation or to mechanically
ventilated TBI patients in
the intensive care unit.

“TBI patients
who survive
the injury have
a reduced life
expectancy

increased risk
of developing

creased risk of developing
Alzheimer’s disease or
other dementias later in
life.
Now, researchers from
amount of time.
All three groups then
underwent learning and
memory tests at two
weeks and 20 months
after the injury. Time of
death was recorded and
the mice brain tissues
were examined.
The researchers found
that the TBI xenon
group had the same
life expectancy as the
healthy control group
which had not suffered a
TBI. However, the TBI
control group developed
late-onset cognitive
profile - and today’s
findings - the researchers
hope in the future to
evaluate the effectiveness
of xenon in human TBI
patients.
