We've finally done it!
A
fter ten
months and
27 issues of
Felix, we've
finally done it! This is
officially the earliest
I've ever written my
Editorial and we are
100% on track to hit
the print deadline. Not
the imaginary print
deadline which I have
been bending to my
will every week, but the
actual print deadline!
This means I might ac-
tually step foot outside
the basement whilst
there's still daylight on a
Thursday evening...
Once again, I'm
drawing a blank when
it comes to writing this
Editorial. I think I need
the pressure of needing
to submit in five minutes
to get the creative juices
flowing. I watched Love
Island for the first time
yesterday so I'm tempted
to turn this whole Editori-
al into one big Love Island
meme but, if I'm honest, I
couldn't really see what
the hype is about. One
thing I will mention,
though, is Sherif. To
arrive on the island with
no trim is one thing. To
then be surprised that
nobody stepped forward
to couple up (is that what
it's called?), is a whole
separate matter. If, by
some miracle, a copy of
this issue of Felix makes
its way to the island, read
carefully Sherif: Believe
in your Barber! Failing
that, invest in a bucket hat
please.
In keeping with the
rest of this term so far,
this week's issue of Felix
is a slim one. 'Felix-lite'
if you will. However,

its size belies an issue
packed with the finest
hard-hitting journalism.
No thanks to me, I might
add. Deputy Editor,
Joanna, has conducted
a thorough analysis of
last week's Augar report,
which recommended a
reduction in tuition fees.
The issue of tuition fees is
far more nuanced than it
might seem at first glance
and time will tell if a
reduction in fees will ul-
timately benefit prospec-
tive students or if it will

“Will not

simply "reverse progress

This week's issue also
sees the final Postgraduate
feature of this academic
year. I'm glad that we've
been able to get this
section of the ground this
year and my only hope is
that it continues to grow
next year after I've handed
over. As Ute's article
addresses, there is still
a long way to go before
postgraduate students feel
adequately represented
and supported by the
Union.
Be sure to pick up a
copy of next week's issue
of Felix for a roundup
of the political uprising
in Sudan (an issue that
has been disappointingly
under-reported by main-
stream media outlets).
Section of the week
goes to the Music section.

should increase its finan-
cial contributions to make
up for the loss of universi-
ties’ incomes as a result of
lower tuition fees. These
increased contributions
should, according to the
report, be focused on the
courses which are most
expensive to provide –
such as STEM subjects
– and those that offer
“better value”.
However, former
Universities Minister, Jo
Johnson, has expressed
doubts over the Treasury’s
willingness to increase
higher education funding,
saying the Augar report’s
recommendations will
“destabilise university
finances, imperil many
courses and reverse
progress in widening
access”. Education Sec-
retary, Damian Hinds,
has dismissed claims
that the Augar report’s
recommendations will put
universities into financial
hardship as “scaremon-
gering”.

Analysis
Last year, Imperial College submitted three priorities to theAugar report’s review
panel. The College said any changes to financing must be sustainable and bridge
the gap [estimated at £90 million for Russell Group universities alone] between
existing funding for and the actual cost of providing “a world-leading STEM edu-
cation”, and should ensure higher education is accessible regardless of a student’s
financial circumstances. How far do the Augar report’s recommendations meet
these priorities?
Analysis by auditing firm KPMG revealed that UK universities spend 42% of
their income on teaching – considerably less than higher education institutes in
other countries. Managing estates, student services, and corporate and administra-
tive costs account for 47%. The remaining 10% is used as a “margin for sustaina-
bility and investment” (i.e. money used to protect against future risk and to ensure
services and standards can be maintained or improved). This MSI equates to an
average of £1,000 per student – a figure the Augar report describes as “substantial”.
The report also notes that the higher education sector is “in a reasonably solid
financial position”.
The specialised equipment required for many STEM subjects means these
courses are more costly to provide than many arts- or humanities-based degrees.
As a STEM-focused university, Imperial has less opportunity to subsidise more
expensive courses with surplus from courses that cost less than £9,250 per student
per year, as many other universities do. However, Imperial may be able to benefit
disproportionately if the government decides to implement the recommendation
that funding should be focused on “high-cost and high-value subjects” as part of
the government’s Industrial Strategy, which includes a pledge to increase spending
on research and development from 1.7% to 2.4%. The Augar report states: “Our
proposals … are intended to encourage [STEM education] and are likely to result
in more funding going to institutions with a strong research base.”
The reintroduction of maintenance grants, which do not have to be paid back, will
help those less able to cover their living costs but the benefits of the report’s other
suggestions – cutting tuition fees and interest rates while spreading repayments
over a longer period – are less certain.
As Felix has previously reported, cutting tuition fees primarily benefits the
highest-earning graduates. Two in five graduates earn less than £25,000 five years
after graduating, meaning they fall below the threshold at which they have to start
repaying their student debts, which, on average, amount to over £50,000. Even
factoring in the additional ten years before the debts are written off, low-earning
graduates are unlikely to see any significant change in the amount they pay back.
Higher earners, who are already more likely to be able to pay off their debts in full,
will pay back a lower total amount. An analysis by The Times estimates that the top
5% of earners would pay back £37,323 under the Augar report’s recommendations,
compared to £55,452 under the current system. Meanwhile, middle-earners on
salaries of £30,000-£40,000 – who currently repay an average of £14,844 – would
end up repaying £26,667.
Shadow Education
Minister, Gordon
Marsden, has described
the proposed cut to tuition
fees as “a shallow gesture”
that “will not resolve the
issues that affect pro-
spective students or our
institutions”.
Addressing the House
of Commons earlier
this week, Hinds said:
“Whatever decisions we
make about how best to
take forward recommen-
dations in this report, it's
vital that we support these
institutions to continue to
offer world-leading higher
education to students in
future.”
