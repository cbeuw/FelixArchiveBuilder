aturday 25th
May
will be remem-
bered as the day
when the athletes
of Imperial College came
together one last time to
compete in the LUCA
Outdoors series, in the
same fanatic spirit that
has defined this club in the
past few years and made
it the LUCA Club of the
Year
One of the first events
was Shot Put, where
Patricia Santos threw
6.01m, making me
question whether I should
start going to the gym. Our
award winning Women’s
Captain, Charlotte Barratt,
and the Athletics Captain,
Jack Mitchell, also took
part, throwing 6.38m and
6.72m, respectively. Jack
went on to take part in
the Long Jump, where he
registered 4.74m. In the
same event, James Weller
came third, jumping an
impressive 5.32m
Our brave warriors
dominated Men’s Javelin,
as Arthur Jurgenson
won the event, followed
“You guessed
it, it’s the
steeplechase!”

closely by Greg Jones,
who came second,
making people wonder if
Aeronautical Engineering
students have an unfair
advantage in this event.
While Olivia Papaioannou
came within a few inches
from winning the event,
she kept fighting through-
out the day in three other
track events.
One of the club’s
living legends, Raul
Rinken, won the Discus,
throwing an impressive
39.6m, while Nnaemeka
Anyamele threw 30.15m
to come fourth. Marta
Van Ginkel and Maryna
Voloshyna also took part,
throwing 17.57m and
16.55m respectively.
Moving on to track, it
has to be said, Imperial
caused quite a lot of
damage. In the 100m
sprint, Will Fisher won his
heat by running 12.03s.
He also did the 200m in
an impressive time of
24.70s. Alex Mundell
absolutely crushed the
400m sprint, leaving her
opponents four whole
seconds behind and fin-
ishing the race in 61.41s.
This race left a few people
confused, as they taught
she was running by
herself. Alex also claimed
third place in the 200m,
running an impressive
28.27s, reminding the
other London universi-
ties that she’s “tiny but
mighty”. The day saw
Niki Faulkner take on
the 400m race as well,
running in heat 1 with
mostly 100% fast-twitch
muscle fibre boys that
probably spend too much
time in the gym. He did
not disappoint, finishing
the race in 53.38s, a time
that makes any so-called
“sprinter” pretty damn
jealous.
One of the most
exciting events was Men’s
800m, which saw James
Millett tactically win by
a few inches. James let
his UCL opponent dictate
the pace throughout the
race, only to bite in the
last 20m, just like an oily
snake. Millett took home
the gold medal for the
athletics championship
and also won the 1500m
gold medal, ranking
him third in the LUCA
Outdoors MVP standing.
These two events made us
realise James has got quite
an extraordinary fan base
among UCL students,
as most of them where
shouting “Go, Hugo!
Go!”; very personal too,
as they knew his middle
name. Thomas Bayley
and Fergus Johnson also
took part in this race,
clocking 4:14 and 4:42
respectively.
The 5000m saw a few
Imperial athletes running
twelve and a half laps in
the scorching sun. Female
Athlete of the Year,
Georgia Curry, claimed
gold after finishing the
race in 17 minutes and
59 seconds; dabs were
included. Alix Vermeulen
came second with a time
of 19:07 and Nina Rimsky
finished in 23:44. The
boys put up a good fight in
the heath as well, with Joe
Pomfret finishing fourth
in 17 minutes and 22
seconds, followed closely
by Mihaly Ormay, Matt
Ryan, Jim Warren and
Jack Teh. Yes, Matt, we
know! You beat Jim.
who finished the race in
11:02. The Club Captain,
Fergus Johnson, also
managed to clock an
admirable time of 12:07,
while veteran Lawrence
Kar Tse finished the race
in 14:37. The girls did
not disappoint either. In
the 2000m steeplechase,
Chloe Baker came first,
with an impressive time of
7 minutes and 43 seconds,
placing her third in the
league. She was followed
by Alix Vermeulen, Olivia
Papaioannou, Maryna Vo-
loshyna and Marie Jones.
As the day came to an
end, it was time for the
race of all races, the one
to decide all rivalries,
the Medley Relay. Each
university put up a team
of three men and three
women to run with a
baton distances of 200m,
400m and 800m. This is
the time to take out the big
guns. As the race went on,
students from every uni-
versity were cheering and
shouting their runners’
names at all times, until
one moment… The race
was very close, UCL and
King’s were leading for
most of the first four legs.
James Millett managed to
come par with them at the
end of his leg, and then it
happened. Alex Mundell
got the baton and started
sprinting the first 200m
just like in her previous
race. Students from the
other universities thought
she wouldn’t be able
to keep it up, but they
could have not been more
wrong; not when you have
an 800m specialist doing
it. The UCL and King’s
crowds went silent as
Alex kept increasing the
gap between her and her
opponent. Having put in
this amazing performance,
Imperial College retained
their Medley Relay trophy
for a second year in a row.
Some people claimed that
it was not fair, because the
800m legs were a lot more
important than the shorter
ones and it gave Imperial
an unfair advantage. To
those people, I have two
statements: “Gold is
gold!” and “Get better at
running!”.
That’s all folks! This
university athletics
season saw Imperial
College rank third overall,
above King’s, last year’s
champions. The Medley
Relay trophy and the
medals made our athletes
pretty happy at the end
of the day, some say too
happy… and maybe that
trophy should get cleaned
before handing it over,
probably with bleach.

Moving on to some
water jump naughtiness...
yaas. You guessed it, it’s
the steeplechase! Our ori-
enteering pioneer, Mihaly
Ormay, stormed the race,
coming third with a time
of 10:58. He was followed
by Charlie McFadzean,
