& Creem, the
up-and-coming in-
dependent festival
returns to Cambridge’s
Haggis Farm on Saturday
15th
June with its signature
line-up of house, hip-hop
and R&B, and Noughties
throwbacks. Speaking
to Felix, Cambridge
University graduate
Chris Jammer - the
festival co-founder (who
the eagle-eyed amongst
you may recognise as a
winner from E4’s series
Shipwrecked) – said the
festival promises “the
experience of a day
out… not too far from
London and it’s just all
about positivity and good
vibes and throwback fun
really, while remaining
credible and current with
the music we’re putting
on”. Felix investigates the
reasons why Strawberries
& Creem has become a
firm fixture in the summer
festival calendar.
Independent
Curated by a small
team of just seven young
creatives, the one day
event stays true to its
ethos: “celebrate heritage,

champion future”. The
team consists of a mix
of Cambridge University
graduates, Cambridge
locals and Anglia Ruskin
University graduates.
Chris told Felix: “We’re
a bunch of 25 year olds
really just having fun
and putting something on
that we’d want to go to,
rather than a big corpo-
ration trying to impose
what they feel is needed.
We’re just doing this for
everyone else like us.” As
such, the festival is a real
celebration of good vibes
and the hottest names in
house, rap and R&B, and
garage. Although having
such a small team may in-
itially seem like it would
pose a challenge, Chris
explained to Felix why
this has been a strength
in running Strawberries
& Creem: “In the festival
industry, most festivals
are owned by the same
sort of people, whereas
we are independent so
we’re coming in trying to
prove our brand value and
our trustworthiness. When
we’reworkingwithbrands
and new people, just
getting across the vision
of what you’re doing and
actually if you’re capable
of delivering that sort of
stuff.” Strawberries &
Creem always shows true
support for UK music
and this enthusiasm has
been reciprocated by the
industry.
The festival con-
tinues to go from
strength to strength
Originally created five
years ago as an end of year
garden party celebration
for the students of Cam-
bridge, Strawberries &
Creem now successfully
provides the city with an
exciting musical identity
that continues to expand
annually. Detailing the
festival’s journey from
just 1000 guests in its first
year to becoming one of
the UK’s fastest growing
events, Chris explained:
“In Cambridge Univer-
sity, they have something
called May Week. When
everyone finishes exams,
every College and associ-
ation has their own party.
The May Balls, especially,
are quite privileged - they
cost a lot of money to go
to, got to dress in black-
tie, that sort of thing;
so we wanted to put an
alternative in that space,
delivering the music we
wanted to listen to. Just
challenge the make up of
Cambridge University’s
May Week a little bit. That
started as a garden party
but we called it a music
festival and it was just
really a stage with a few
toilets and a burger van.
From there, we’ve gone
from strength to strength.
Last year we did 10,000,
this year we’re going to do
12,500.” Chris also added
“This year, we’ve estab-
lished ourselves enough
that brands are coming to
us; that’s a good sign of
growth.”
The shift in line-up has led to an“interesting”shift in
demographic // Strawberries & Creem
Diverse Lineup
With the 2019 edition
set to be topped by
MOBO winner Stefflon
Don - whose meteoric rise
has seen her gain interna-
tional success with French
Montana, Tory Lanez,
Jeremih, Sean Paul and
Ne-Yo collaborations –
this year’s Strawberries &
Creem promises a musi-
cally diverse line-up. The
rapper will be joined by
UK pioneer Ms Dynamite,
who was honoured with
an MBE last year for her
services to music, which
count breakthrough hit
‘Ms Dy-Na-Mi-Tee’ and
the 2002 Mercury Prize.
Chris’ excitement was
palpable as he told Felix:
“I’m really looking
“It was a
hobby and
then, when I
left university,
I thought,‘why
not try and
make this work
full time’”

forward to, first of all,
having a female-led
line-up, which was
something that the festival
industry has been criti-
cised for before. Steff and
Ms Dynamite were two
acts that we’ve wanted to
book for a very long time
and it’s been timely for us
that Ms. Dynamite started
performing again and
Steff’s still within budget,
just about.”

wealth of respected acts
perform in recent years,
including Wiley. Chris
told Felix: “We’ve got it
right probably the last four
out of five years; we’ve
got Skepta just before he
dropped ‘Shutdown’, J
Hus just before he dropped
Common Sense, Kano
just before he dropped
Made in the Manor, so
they’ve always come to
this festival with new
material that was already
popping.” This year is no
exception, with festival
headliner Stefflon Don
arriving with a plethora of
songs in the charts at the
moment.

Abra Cadabra was
amongst last year’s sur-
prise guests // Strawberries

that aren’t on our line-up.
Historically, we’ve been
quite good at getting
people to come out on sets.
Last year, we had the likes
of Abra Cadabra, NSG,
BBK – Shorty and Frisco
came out. There’s a lot to
look forward to that isn’t
actually on the line-up.
Just look at people who
are featured with some
of our headliners. I won’t
say any more than that.”
