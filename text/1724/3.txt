No sympathy for Theresa May
While the media was full of coverage of a tearful moment in the Prime Minister’s resignation
speech, it’s her victims who we should really be focusing on

L
et me start by
stating very
clearly: it is a
privilege, not a
right, to hold the most
powerful job in the United
Kingdom. This shouldn’t
be a controversial state-
ment, yet when Theresa
May briefly broke down
her veneer of stone-cold
emotionlessness, the press
immediately jumped onto
it, making it headline
news in the newspapers
and spending hours upon
end holding debates and
discussing whether or not
we should feel sorry for
her.
This is symptomatic of
media that treats politics
like a pantomime, played
on the grand stage of
Westminster and detached
from the real world. It is
symptomatic of media
that doesn’t truly hold our
politicians accountable
and doesn’t understand the
human cost of the policies
implemented by them.
Before we even begin to
wonder if we should feel
sorry for a Prime Minister
who was pushed around
by a bunch of opportunist
disaster capitalists from
her backbenches, let’s
examine her record first.
Before stepping into
Downing Street, May was
the Home Secretary under
David Cameron. As Home
Secretary, she oversaw
the ‘hostile environment’
policies that put migrants
at risk, culminating in the
deportation and denial
of healthcare of lawful
citizens of the Windrush
generation. For this, the
new Home Secretary
Amber Rudd got sacked,
while May continued her
premiership in Downing
Street. This was without
a doubt an example of
systemic racism: policies
that disproportionately
impact people of a certain
ethnicity negatively; in
this case, lawfully settled
black Britons.
She also pushed
forward the Snoopers’
Charter, a large expansion
of investigatory powers
that, had it passed, would
allow the state to further
violate individual privacy.
This was *after* the mass
NSA/GCHQ surveillance
revealed by Edward
Snowden.
While in government,
and as head of it, she
oversaw a rise in home-
lessness and in children
living in temporary
accommodation, with a
UN special rapporteur de-
nouncing the government
for the scale of poverty in
the UK. She oversaw the
gradual privatisation of
the NHS by contracting
services out to private
companies, creating a
decline in healthcare
standards as well as an
increase in waiting times.
She oversaw the cuts to
disability benefits that
subsequently led the
Equality and Human
Rights Commission to
state that one in five
disabled people have their
human rights violated.
Most shamefully of all,
the hard-right austerity
agenda enacted by her
government has been
linked to 120,000 prevent-
able deaths in a landmark
UCL study.
This is without men-
tioning her government’s
inaction on climate
change, which included
going back on a promise
to her Maidenhead con-
stituents by passing a third
Heathrow runway bill. It
is without mentioning the
continuation of immoral
British foreign policy
by arming Saudi Arabia,
which is waging war in
Yemen, and Israel, which
is committing grave
human rights violations
in Palestine. It is without
mentioning the sheer
incompetence displayed
by her and her chosen
Brexit Ministers (David
disaster? Why did she feel
more upset about being
forced to resign from the
most powerful job in the
country, than she did about
the human consequences
of her policies? Theresa
May will no doubt live a
comfortable and indulgent
life until the very end, but
the same cannot be said for
her victims, who are either
dead or still suffering.
Theresa May wasn’t an
especially evil or immoral
person compared to those
leaders who preceded her
and those who will come
after, but, like any other
individual, she has always
had a choice.
To sum up: can we
feel sorry for Theresa
May? I’ll let her record
speak for itself.

in the negotiations with
the EU and with her own
party, and the disenfran-
chisement of the millions
of EU citizens living in
the UK.
So, I ask: where was
this emotion during the
government’s disgraceful
response to the Grenfell
