T
he phrase ‘opioid
crisis’ has in
the past had
a Teflon-like
quality about it, like ‘civil
war’or ‘theocracy’. These
are terms used to describe
distant news items.
Fentanyl and oxycodone
were intangible prob-
lems. However, studies
by the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation
and Development
(OECD) show that while
UK opioid use is still
below that of the US, in
daily doses per million
of population, between
2013 and 2016 Britons
increased their opioid
consumption more than
the citizens of any other
country surveyed, ex-
cepting those from Israel
or Slovakia. The effect
of this has been around
2000 fatalities attributed
to opioid painkillers every
year, an increase of 41%
over the last decade.
These lethal pills are
not bought through the
black market, at least
not initially. Instead they
are prescribed, usually
by GPs, to non-surgical
patients who turn to other
means to acquire the
drugs that they depend
on once their prescription
runs out. A look across
the Atlantic reveals the
potential consequences
of our current behaviour.
In the US more than 130
people die every day from
opioid overdoses, largely
the consequence of over-
zealous prescription in the
1990s.
There is no quick-fix
solution. Addicts are
maligned as junkies
looking to secure their
next hit of temporary
bliss. The reality is that
painkiller addicts trying
to live normal lives must
turn to dealers for the pills
they depend on for tran-
sient relief. Tragically,
overuse of prescription
opioids can cause a
condition called hyperal-
gesia, a form of chronic
pain. Long-term opioid
users can find themselves
locked in a cycle of agony
from which the only relief
is ever larger doses. In
trying to provide relief
doctors have only exacer-
bated the problem.
Any response to this
growing crisis must
be motivated first and
foremost by compassion.
Neither a tough response
that promises to punish
people for what has
befallen them nor the
hand-wringing displayed
by Dave Thompson,
Chief Constable of West
Midlands Police, who
refuses to follow the law
on cannabis farms for fear
of harming people’s “life
chances”, will help these
victims.
Instead the UK should
take a two-pronged
approach. Firstly, GP
appointments must be
lengthened to enable GPs
to address the root causes
of patients’ pain rather
than resorting to prescrib-
ing opioids as a catch-all.
Pharmacists should also
only sell the exact number
of pills required by the
prescription, to avoid
dependency or pills being
sold.
Secondly, the Home
Office should support
Glasgow and other cities,
with their plan to open
‘shooting galleries’ to
help those whose lives
have been destroyed by
opioids, by passing the
necessary legal amend-
ments. Shooting galleries
would provide safe places
for drug users to inject or
ingest their own drugs,
in regulated dosages,
with medical staff in
attendance. In Portugal
these measures have
successfully curbed fatal
overdoses, the spread
of HIV and hepatitis C.
The government should
be brave enough to
break with the previous
morally bankrupt policy
and embrace data driven
methods to avert an
epidemic of addiction and
broken lives..
