The Road to E3 2019: Everything we know so far and
TheElectronicEntertainmentExpo(E3)hasalwaysbeen

consoles. E3 2019 takes place from 11th to 14th June in

“With the
absence of
Sony, and
the internet
rife with
rumours of the
Playstation 5”
O
fficially, the
expo runs for
three days.
However, the
E3 phenomena is more
than just the LA conven-
tion. It encompasses all
the announcements for
new computer and video
game releases, as well as
the teasing of new video
game hardware. From
publishers announcing
the next set of DLC as a
means of breathing life
into their existing fran-
chises, revealing new IPs,
and giving fuel to the fans
for their console wars,
one could say E3 2019
lasts weeks, with many
announcements for major
series having already been
made this week and more
to be released next week.

With the absence
of Sony at E3, but the
internet rife with rumours
of the PlayStation 5, the
Xbox E3 Briefing would
be the best opportunity
for Microsoft to make
waves this month with the
announcement of the next
generation of the Xbox,
currently codenamed
Project Scarlett. Industry
insiders have suggested
that if Microsoft does do
an official annoucement
for their next gen console,
then there will be succes-
sors to both the Xbox One
X and the Xbox One S.
Most likely though,
it will be the Project
xCloud which will be the
hardware focus of this
conference, as an answer
to Playstation Now and
the recently announced
Google Stadia.
In terms of video game
titles, we can expect more
information and official
annoucements for Halo
Infinite, Gears 5 and a
new Forza title.
Bethesda
Conference Date:
Monday 10th June.
Time: 1.30 AM BST
Viewing Platforms:
Twitch, YouTube, Twitter,
Mixer and Facebook
A recent statement
from Todd Howard has
indicated that we will
not be seeing Bethesda’s
new sci-fi IP, Starfield,
nor Elder Scrolls VI at E3
this year. Not the biggest
disappointment from
Bethesda (that would be
Fallout 76), but this does
leave us to speculate on
what Bethesda will be
showing this year.
The most obvious
options would be content
updates to the Elder
Scrolls Online and
Fallout 76. Additionally,
The Avengers Project is set to be delved into at E3 2019 // Square Enix
we should expect more
information about Doom
Eternal.
Sadly, it’s unlikely that
we will get a new edition
of Skyrim at this E3.
Devolver Digital
Conference Date:
Monday 10th June.
Time: 3.00 AM BST
Viewing Platforms:

Sometimes Monsters,

Developers and
hardware makers for PC
are invited to participate
in the PC Gaming Show.
PC Gamer has revealed
that they are expecting a
lot of titles to showcase
during the two hour lives-
tream.
If you’re excited by
stepping into the shoes of
a supervillain for a second
time, then the world’s first
reveal of Evil Genius 2
will be right up your alley.
Developer Rebellion
will also be revealing an
unannounced title. New
footage of Last Oasis as
well as the projects that
developer Tripwire Inter-
active has been working
on will be featured.
Gearbox will take the
stage and discuss the
upcoming Borderlands 3
in depth To coincide with
the upcoming release of
Borderlands 3, Border-
lands 2 will be receiving a
free DLC update to set the
stage for the sequel.
Expect more informa-
tion from Paradox Inter-
active about Vampire: The
Masquerade - Bloodlines
2 and Age of Wonders:
Planetfall.
Samsung is also
information about their
gaming monitors.
The PCGaming Show
is expected to have many
more titles both an-
nounced and unannouced
so far.
Ubisoft
Conference Date:

Ubisoft has recently
teased what people should
expect for their E3 con-
ference and this includes
updates to existing games
and a celebrity showdown.
Current titles expected
to make an apperance at
E3 include For Honor,
Rainbow Six Siege
and Tom Clancy’s The
Division 2.
Atweet from the official
Watch Dogs twitter
account has confirmed
that the third game in this
franchise, titled Watch
Dogs Legion, will be ap-
pearing at E3. This game
will be set in London.
Rumours have it that you
will be able to play as any
of the NPCs in the new
setting of London.
The focal point of this
conference is likely to be
Ghost Recon Breakpoint
which has an October
2019 release, meaning that
this game will likely get
extensive attention during
the Ubisoft briefing.
Ubisoft has annouced
that they are working on
three brand new AAA
titles, so it is possible that
these three games could
also be teased during their
broadcast.
Square Enix
Conference Date:
Tuesday 11th June.
Time: 2.00 AM BST
Viewing Platforms:
Twitch and YouTube
With Sony’s State
of Play broadcast last
month teasing fans with a
short reveal for the Final
Fantasy VII Remake, and
after Square has been
notably silent on the
project for years, specu-
lation has been fueled on
whether this game will be
making an appearance at
E3. Who knows, maybe,
we might get a release
date.
The Avengers Project,
which is currently being
worked on by Crystal
Dynamics and Edi-
os-Montreal alongside
direct involvement from
Square Enix and Marvel
Entertainement, will have
an official annoucement at
E3 2019, which so far has
only had a small teaser in
2017.
Square Enix has
been quite silent this
year, with the release
of Kingdom Hearts 3
in January, followed by
a critical mode content
update in April. With the
DLC, Kingdom Hearts
3: Re:MIND, slated for a
2019 release, E3 would be
the best time for Square
Enix to do a reveal for the
new scenario.
Dragon Quest XI is
also releasing for the
Switch later this year, so
it might also be a part of
the conference this year.
Additionally, we may get
more info about Dragon
Quest Builders 2 for the
Nintendo Switch.
Nintendo
Conference Date:

The June 5th
Nintendo Direct gave
us a few details about
the upcoming Pokemon
Sword and Shield for the
Nintendo Switch. We
can expect a full depth
annoucement of several
details pertaining to the
first ever home console
mainline Pokemon games
during the Nintendo E3
Direct.
From Nintendo’s big
franchise, The Legend
o Zelda and Mario, it is
very unlikely that we will
see anything about their
next big mainline games.
However, what we can
expect is information
about the Link’s Awak-
ening remake and Mario
Maker 2.
There’s some specula-
tion on whether we will
see another beloved fran-
chise, Animal Crossing,
during this year’s E3
Direct, as the game
does have a 2019 launch
window.
Super Smash Bros
Ultimate had it’s most
recent content update
in April, where the first
DLC Fighter, Joker from
Persona 5, was added to
the game. There are still
four DLC fighters to be
announced. Could we get
a teaser of the second DLC
fighter at E3? Possibly.
Other games which
could make an apperance
include Luigi’s Mansion
3 and Fire Emblem Three
Houses.
E3 will be host to many exciting annoucements inclduing the next chapter of Halo // Xbox
expected to reveal more
