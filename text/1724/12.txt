Flying regularly not crucial for success in academia
S
cience is quite
rightly celebrated
for being an inter-
national enterprise,
and academics often feel
required or obliged to
fly frequently and over
long-distances in order
to conduct their work or
maintain professional
relationships. But how
important is long-distance
travel to a scientific
career, and how much do
scientists contribute to
climate change through
their travels?
30% of academics
who surveyed by the
Tyndall Centre felt an
expectation to fly from
their university. A new
study at the University of
British Colombia (UBC)
suggests this pressure may
not be rationally founded.
Although academics who
change affiliation are
found to have 40% more
citations, academics who
fly more frequently do
not have a greater number
of citations, nor do they
have a greater number of
co-authors per paper.
Attending conferences,
undertaking fieldwork
and teaching all contrib-
ute to the demand for
travel by air, with 60%
of demand coming from
travel for conferences.
In a sample of 705 aca-
demics at UBC, claims
for air travel were made
for 2.9 trips per person
each year on average.
Of these, 10% of trips
were same-day returns,
long-distance flights with
only one overnight stay,
or short-distance flights
for which ground-based
transport could be taken.
Such trips have a high
carbon footprint within a
short timeframe.
The scientific consen-
sus on climate change
is clear, and so are
the impacts of flying.
Aviation is the most en-
vironmentally damaging
form of long-distance
transportation. A single
passenger travelling 100
km by plane is responsible
for the production of over
20 kg CO2
e in emissions,
double that by road (10
kg) and seven times that
of a passenger travelling
by rail (3 kg) (see To
the planet every journey
matters below). This is
despite the high seating
efficiency of airlines
thanks pre-booking
systems, less rigorously
imposed in rail and bus
travel, and decades of
optimization of aircraft
design and operation.
Emissions from aircraft
also affect human health
directly. For instance,
emissions from aircraft
increase near-surface
ozone levels and atmos-
pheric sulphate concentra-
tions. While Ozone in the
upper atmosphere blocks
harmful UV frequencies,
at the surface it results
in respiratory diseases.
Sulphate aerosols, though
slightly reducing the
greenhouse effect, have
the potential to cause
drought according to a
briefing paper produced
by the Grantham Institute
at Imperial College.
Using, for the first time,
written records (travel
expenses) as opposed to
self-reported statistics,
which can suffer from
limitations, researchers
found no correlation in
the sample between the
h-index of academics
and the distance flown,
even when accounting for
age of the academic and
number of co-authors on
each paper. Nor was there
a correlation between
number of citations per
author per paper and
distance.
Perhaps flying helps
to produce larger collab-
orations? This too also
does not appear to be the
case, the average number
of co-authors per paper
was no higher for aca-
demics who flew further.
A significant correlation
found was between
emissions and salary. An
possible explanation is
that higher-earning senior
researchers are frequently
invited to give talks and
more likely to afford to fly
in higher class.
Acting to reduce air
travel can come with
economic and social
co-benefits, including
better perception of the
scientific community.
Although academics
are aware and often
sympathetic to environ-
mental issues, they are

sometimes criticised for
the knowledge-action gap
on flight. A ten-year study
of newspapers in four dif-
ferent countries, including
the UK, found that a third
of criticisms levelled at
academics mentioned
their flying behaviour.
Changes need not be
costly. The lowest hanging
fruit is to travel modestly.
Economy class passengers
cause almost three times
lower emissions than
business class, and four
times lower than first class
passengers. Encoding
committments to use the
lowest carbon means of
transportation into grants
could be an effective and
easy strategy and set an
example. Restrictions on
class of seating is already
included in some grants.
Given that reducing
flying is desirable both for
the environment and for
academics, the results of
the research are welcome,
especially since Green
academics were found
to be no less likely to fly
than non-Green.
Air travel may not be
totally elimintated. Some
long-distance travel will
be needed for instance for
fieldwork. One should
be cautious to limit op-
portunities for less secure
researchers who already
travel less. Academics
who did not claim any
air travel expenses were
found to receive fewer ci-
tations. A limited amount
of air travel, used effec-
tiely, may be beneficial.
Above a certain threshold
it is a case of diminishing
returns.
A cultural shift is
needed, but the changes
required already have
a precedent. Awarding
grants which encour-
age low carbon travel,
video-conferencing and
limit use of high class air
travel are strategies which
could be employed to help
researchers give flight to
their research without lib-
erating greenhouse gases.
