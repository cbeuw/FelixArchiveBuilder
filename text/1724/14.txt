Silwood: Imperial’s Green Cupboard
POSTGRADUATE

D
id you know
that Imperial
College has
postgraduate
campus (read: farm) way
out in the countryside?
It’s a whopping 20 miles
from South Kensington. It
is easily the most remote
campus, but also the most
beautiful (suck it SK). I
like to call it Imperial’s
green cupboard. This is
because, for me, it really
does seem like Silwood
is the Harry Potter under
the stairs in the Imperial
household – most of you
don’t know or care that
we’re here. We’re not
bitter in the slightest,
honest!
There are only a couple
of downsides to living
out here in the wilderness
– like the fact that South
Ken controls our heating,
or that very few of the
services provided for the
London campuses make
it all the way out here.
However, despite the very
few downsides, life is
pretty great in the forest.
Below are some of what
I consider to be highlights
of our idyllic lifestyle.
ask someone for help and
they will be nice enough
to give it to me!
Silwood park is pretty
notorious in the ecological
community, and as such
we have guest speakers on
a regular basis to enrich
our university experi-
ence. Once a month the
postdocs and PhDs host
a social seminar, where
they present their research
over pizza and drinks.
The size of the campus
means that, not only is
the student community
close-knit, but we are
on very good terms with
many of the academics on
campus, which promotes
a really relaxed but driven
learning environment.
Most universities, I
find, have a clear divide
between the students and
the academics. Here, the
lines are less definite – we
are all here to learn.
I feel very privileged
to live here. There are
very few places where
you could get such a
wholesome and fulfilling
university experience.
The pace of life is very dif-
ferent to London but that’s
honestly a good thing in
my opinion, there’s time
to focus on what’s impor-
tant. If you want to come
check out the campus for
yourself, we are hosting
a fully-fledged festival
on the 3rd
of August! You

Please don’t forget
about us xx
I
would like to
nominate Professor
Dominik Weiss from
the Earth Science and
Engineering department
for the best supervision
award. He is just a great
guy and I am lucky to
have him as my supervi-
sor! I am coming towards
the end of my PhD and
I couldn’t have done it
without him.
Dominik has always
been there to support me
throughout my PhD. He
provides just the right
amount of advice to push
me in the right direction
without taking over or
preventing me from
learning new things. He
is extremely open to col-
laborating with different
people from all over the
world, by both suggesting
people to collaborate
with, and by allowing us
to find our own collabo-
rators. For example, he
has helped me to collab-
orate with Gaussian, a
company which develops
the software I use for my
computational chemistry
calculations. My research
was supposed to focus on
experimental methods,
but because I was inter-
ested in computational
chemistry, he actively
encouraged me to develop
my skills in this area. He
went outside his comfort
zone to learn this disci-
pline with me, and how to
apply it to environmental
problems. This is a trait
of all great researchers
and supervisors. He has
now incorporated the
discipline into other PhD
student projects.
He encourages all his
students to explore areas
outside of academia. He
regularly tells us about in-
ternships he comes across
which he thinks we will
find interesting. I ended
up doing a 6 month intern-
ship at the Department
for Business, Energy and
Industrial Strategy which
provided useful insights to
life outside of academia.
He supported me when it
looked like there would
be funding issues, and did
everything in his power to
make sure I could do it.
The most important
thing though is that he
always puts us first before
the research. He always
wants us to have a good
work-life balance. This
can often be forgotten
by PhD students like me
who get absorbed in their
research! His door is open
regardless of whether you
want to discuss research
or a personal issue.
Ultimately, he is no
longer a supervisor, but a
lifelong friend.”
What Best Supervision
meant to Imperial College
PG Students this year?
“Congrat-
ulations from
all the PG
community!”
The Union’s promises
towards PG are good.
Sticking to these promises
would be better.

Ute Thiermann
GSU President
I
n the beginning of
my period as GSU
President, I had fre-
quent meetings with
the Union’s Managing
Director, Jarlath O’Hara,
and some of the Officer
Trustees, particularly
Rob Tomkies [Union
President] and Alejandro
Luy [Deputy President
(Education)]. Damn, we
had really good plans! For
the first time, we would
try to work together and
orchestrate our efforts to
work towards the needs
of PG students. Maybe
for the first time in many
years, Union represent-
atives have not only
admitted that PG students
are largely neglected by
the Union, they went even
further and promised that
they would support us
(the GSU) in our activities
and strategies. The goal
was that the Union should
work with the GSU as
their executive arm to
address PG needs. Direct
key contacts were identi-
fied for every GSU officer,
as well as sub-committees
set up to work together
more effectively. We
agreed on a timeline of ac-
tions and events, and the
PG Black Tie Ball would
be our highlight project
to trial and optimise our
cooperation. While the
first few months were
quite successful, with a
full review of our GSU
governance structure, the
Union’s efforts to hold
their promises have dras-
tically declined over the
last 6 months. On paper,
our sub-committees
looked great, but words
need to be put into action
to turn into reality.
The most disappointing
experience was the Union
management’s attitude
regarding the PG Black
Tie Ball. During the
one (and only) meeting
in 2019 concerning the
ball, the officers and the
Head of Student Voice
& Communication reaf-
firmed their promises to
turn the Black-Tie ball
into a flagship event for
PG students. Help with
the marketing campaign
and the organisation of
the event and financial
administration were all
pledged. For the GSU,
this was the first Ball; for
the Union, one of many.
Counting on the
Union’s support, we
aimed big and put plans
in place to make the event
happen. Unfortunately, we
were left feeling under-
whelmed by the support
we were given. The
promises that were made,
for support with organ-
isation and advertising,
were left unfulfilled, with
nobody from the Union
even being involved. The
Communications team
declined to help with
advertising until all the
tickets for the Summer
Ball, scheduled to happen
three weeks after the
Postgraduate event and
mainly aimed at attracting
Undergraduates, were
sold. This, combined with
poor advice from elected
Officers, has meant the
flagship postgraduate
event, which had such
promise, almost failed
to happen. Despite this
seeming abandonment
from the Union, our GSU
committee has managed
to pull together as a team
to provide what looks to
be a fantastic event. Most
tickets have now been
sold and we can be proud
that, for the first time, we
are bringing PG students
from every campus and
faculty together as one
Imperial Postgraduate
community.
The people at the Union
did have good intentions,
and there has been help
along the way that has
been welcomed. What
may have been underesti-
mated is that for a change
in long-lasting traditions,
we need to fundamentally
change the way we work.
We need extra care, effort
and allocation of resourc-
es to engage a community
that has different needs
to the Undergraduate
population. We hope that,
in the next academic year,
the freshly elected Union
officers will turn those
promises into actions.
Luckily, we have our PG
representative Ashley
Brooks starting as Deputy
President (Education), so
our hopes are up!

“As a supervisor,
Dominik is so generous
with his time. He always
finds a way to fit in a
meeting to discuss a
problem you may be
having with research or
to write a letter of rec-
ommendation for a grant
you might have applied
for. Equally, if he needs
to set aside a whole day/
week to come down to
the lab and help you, he
will. He is always prompt
at marking reports and
giving feedback on drafts
of papers. Even when he
is out of the country on a
visit to another institution
or on a well-earned break,
he will still be contactable.
He also recognises where
a problem is beyond his
field of expertise and will
introduce us to another
academic at the college or
beyondwhoisbettersuited
to help (I am currently on
a 9-week research trip at
the University of Valencia,
learning a new electro-
chemical technique).
Beyond purely
academic supervision,
Dominik is a genuinely
kind person who always
looks to see the best in the
situation - for example,
even when our lab
flooded, he was able to
see the brighter side and
joked about the opportu-
nity it presented to give it
a good clean. He takes an
interest in the lives of his
doctoral students outside
of the college and is a
pleasure to share a coffee
with (and he always buys
the coffees).”

less troubling in the

I’m a drama queen.
It’s not my fault, just my
natural reaction is one of
overreaction. You can find
me having a lie down after
anything remotely dis-
tressing happens. Like a
rich woman in the 1700s.
But go outside and see
some nature? I snap out of
it pretty quick. The world
isn’t ending because your
R code won’t work. The
trees said so. I am writing
this article that I have been
procrastinating for weeks,
at my desk, in the sun, and
a deer just ran out of the
forest past my window.
Life is good.

Life on the commune is
sweet. We are really trying
to distance ourselves from
the distinctly un-green
reputation that Imperial
holds, and take solace in
the simple pleasures in
life. We are proud to have
allotments on campus.
This year a communal
garden project was
started, where everyone
chips in a little, so we can
all reap the fresh veggie
goodness. It’s spring time
now so the veggies are
just being seeded! If you
find yourself on campus
and are itching to get your
hands dirty, help is always
appreciated!
“There are
cats!”
There is a gorgeous
little ginger one who is
all sunshine and light,
his name is Mr Tinkles.
There is also a black cat
with cross-eyes; she is
not so nice and incredibly
demanding but loved
nonetheless. Her name
varies depending on who
you ask – usually either
Seitan, Salem, or Nigel.
These two are really in
charge of the campus, and
we’re all okay with that.
“A sense of
community”
“We are all
here to learn”
When everyone is here,
there are roughly 200
people on campus. Now,
that’s not a whole lot of
people. It’s a massively
different pace of life to
London but here I know
everyone’s name. If
you live in London, this
might be a bit of an alien
concept to you. Honestly,
even at my old uni, I
knew the names of about
10% of my class. Maybe
that says more about me,
though, than anything
else. The few students
here are studying a wide
variety of courses, ranging
from computational,
coding-based courses to
courses that go to the rain-
forest for most of the year.
I feel confident that when
I inevitably get lost in my
code or whatever, I can
