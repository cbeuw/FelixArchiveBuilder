xams are over…
at least for the
majority of us,
and what better
way to celebrate (or grieve
if you’ve still got some
coming) than with some
tasty ethanol-containing
beverages? Thankfully,
summer means a chance
to venture out of your
comfort zone and try
something more unique
than your typical Union
IPA or Jägerbomb, and it’s
not only for basic white
girls – the cocktail. Here’s
a handy summary of a
selection of the classics.
use vodka too. 4 parts
Gin/Vodka, 1 part dry
Vermouth (although ratios
are debatable), and don’t
forget the olive!
Bloody Mary
Commonly consumed
at brunch, this is a bit of
a strange one (who mixes
alcohol and tomatoes?).
3 parts Vodka, 6 parts
tomato juice, and 1 part
lemon juice, with a dash
of Worcestershire sauce,
Tabasco, and a pinch of
salt & pepper. Nutritious?
Margarita
Ideal for summer due to
its many fruity variations
- strawberry, raspberry, or
maybe mango or passion
fruit? Mmmm. 2 parts
Tequila, 1 each of Coin-
treau/Triple Sec and Sour
Mix or lime juice, and
don’t forget to salt/sugar
the rim of the glass.
Cuba Libre
A simple mixer with a
name, this is low effort
and high satisfaction if
you want to greet your
guests with something
other than a beer can. 2
parts Cola, 1 part White
Rum, and a dash of fresh
lime juice and you’re set.
Old Fashioned
Partially reserved for
the posh, partially for
those who enjoy whiskey
(but who says that the two
are mutually exclusive?).
2 parts Whiskey, 3 dashes
of bitters, and a sugar
cube, topped off with soda
or water and garnished
with orange.
Mojito
Probably the first
cocktail you’ve ever
ordered when aged 15, but
“Partially
reserved for
the posh,
partially for
those who
enjoy whiskey
(but who says
that the two
are mutually
exclusive?!)”
“Thankfully
summer means
a chance to
venture out of
your comfort
zone and try
something
more unique
than your
typical
Union IPA or
Jägerbomb”
still a good staple. 4 parts
White Rum, 3 parts lime
juice, topped up with club
soda, and a teaspoon of
sugar and some mint for
good measure.
plus 2 parts lemon juice,
and topped off with Cola.
Add a lemon for good
measure.
Piña Colada
The definition of
summer in a glass
(complete with pineapple,
cocktail umbrellas and
colourful stirrers). 3 parts
pineapple juice, and 1 part
each of cream of coconut
and White Rum. Blend
with ice for a frozen twist!
Sex on the Beach
Yes, this is in fact a
cocktail, and a very good
one at that, combining a
lot of exoticness in one.
2 parts each of Vodka,
orange juice and cran-
berry juice, and 1 part
Peach Schnapps. And,
you guessed it – an orange
slice.
Negroni
Originating in
Florence, this drink is one
of Italy’s many aperitifs
striking that sweet/bitter
balance. Equal parts
Sweet Vermouth, Gin, and
Campari. Add an orange
for the summery vibe.
Whiskey Sour
Not going to lie,
probably not one of the
more confusingly named
cocktails nor one of the
better tasting ones. 3 parts
Whiskey, 2 parts fresh
lemon juice, with a part
of syrup or a teaspoon of
sugar.
Moscow Mule
Although Russia is a
hot topic, this cocktail is
anything but, adding a
refreshing twist to a vodka
cocktail. 1 part Vodka, 2-3
parts ginger beer, and a
dash of lime juice.
Aperol Spritz
The epitome of summer
and the perfect drink,
in terms of aesthetics,
flavour and the fact it is
acceptable at any time
of day (and a personal
favourite if you couldn’t
tell). 3 parts Prosecco, 2
parts Aperol and 1 part
soda. An orange is a must.
Bellini
Now we’re getting
into celebration territory;
although the field is vast,
this is arguably the best
kind of bubbly cocktail
(brunch anyone?). The
most common peach
version has 2 parts
Prosecco and 1 part peach
purée.
Cosmopolitan
Not only for Carrie
Bradshaw, this is a sweet
(but not too sweet) vodka

Dry Martini
The titular reference
has to come first – I mean,
who doesn’t want to be
James Bond? Preferably
made with gin, but can
Daiquiri
A citrusy classic and
Hemingway’s supposed
favourite drink – channel
your inner author by
sipping on this on a sunlit
balcony (preferably in
Cuba). 9 parts White
Rum, 5 parts lime juice,
and 3 parts syrup or half a
teaspoon of sugar.
Gin & Tonic
Honestly, there isn’t
much to say about the
G&T. Eponymous
contents of this drink,
mixed in your desired
proportions, topped off
with a lime and you’re
good to go.
Long Island Iced Tea
Easily one of the
strongest cocktails which
typically doesn’t taste of
alcohol (and you know
what that means…). Equal
parts of Vodka, Rum, Gin,
Triple Sec and Tequila,
sour for those who love
their vodka cranberries.
4 parts Vodka, 3 parts
cranberry juice, and 1 part
each of lime juice and
Triple Sec.
Mai Tai
Tastes nothing like
alcohol, yet guaranteed
to look Insta-worthy; a
decent deal for those basic
white girls out there. 4
parts Rum (mix of white
& dark in a 2:1 ratio), 1
each of Orange Curacao,
lime juice and syrup.
Commonly served with
pineapple.
