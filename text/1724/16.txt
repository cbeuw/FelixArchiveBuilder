T
he Queen’s
Tower Lawn has
been left in a state
of dismay after a
group of hungry vegans
swarmed onto the field,
devouring the majority of
the grass.
The incident, which
occurred last Monday,
was said to have been
a targeted strike by the
Vegetarian & Vegan
Society (VegSoc), acting
both in protest of poor
vegan options, and out
of sheer hunger. Eyewit-
nesses describe the event
as being “like a horde of
locusts, just like in the
Ten Commandments, or
whatever that movie was
called.”
Lois Riupérez, Chair of
VegSoc, was defiant in his
statement. “Yeah, we ate
the grass,” he proclaimed,
“because there’s nothing
else for us to fucking eat
out here! We had the salad
bar and they took that
from us, so now we’re
gonna eat all the goddamn
grass here!”
The mass action was
sparked following the
demolition of the salad bar
to make room for a new
Business School cocktail
bar, and the scrapping of
the Meat-Free Mondays
scheme proposed by
Tania Auditoro, Deputy
President (Pine Nuts &
Lettuces). “This is none
of my business,” she said,
trying to escape a Council
meeting. “I tried my best
but all these damn carni-
vores shut it down.”
NegaFelix has been
inundated with multiple
complaints from students
following the event,
drawing attention to the
quality of the lawn. “It
looks like a visual rep-
resentation of my knowl-
edge,” said Sajid Johnson,
final year Mechanical En-
gineering student, “patchy
and lacking any kind of
substance.”
“All I wanted,” wailed
Samantha Ng, first year
Mathematics, “was to
sit on the grass with my
diverse friendship group,
just like in the prospectus!
How am I meant to do that
now? Imperial has sold
me false dreams!”
Bureaucrat Supreme of
the College, Candice Last,
was said to be pleased with
the outcome, claiming it
to be firmly in line with
the College’s New Green
Policy. “It’s all about the
Benjamins, baby,” she
declared. “Those pesky
vegans get their new food
options, and I get my grass
cut for free! It’s a win-win
for me-me!”
