H
ello! As you may
have noticed, the
nightlife section has
been rather sparse
these last few weeks,
so, to make up for this I’ve given
you a new photo of me that you
can pin up on your wall/keep in
your locket/put in a frame etc. The
reason why I’m not doing nightlife
so much now is mainly because I
don’t have time to lay out the pag-
es and organise all the reviewers
all by myself.
Basically what I’m saying, is
I need help, I need an assistant
nightlife editor! Ever since Alex
left me I’ve been lonely, I need
someone who likes getting sent
free stuff from clubs every day,
who likes the infinite fame of be-
ing involved in Felix and who will
either help lay out the pages or
help organise reviewer guest list
places. Don’t worry, it won’t be un-
til after the exams, so if you are in-
terested, email us at the address
at the top of the page.
In the meantime, read the won-
derful reviews our dedicated writ-
ers have thrown together for us.
Bugged Out and Egg Club, both
great places.
I have
a new
photo!

Felix does the Tootsie Roll
at Canvas Kings Cross
Uffie, Feadz, Busy-P and the mighty Justice take hold of Canvas for the biggest and
best Ed Bangers party yet. We couldn’t not go with such a great line-up
Egg Club
The lovely Egg Club near Kings
Cross were kind enough to invite us
to the opening party for their new
garden and outdoor terrace, and
what a great night it was.
The new look garden was deco-
rated with large flowers/giant bum-
ble bee theme, and boasts the larg-
est outdoor bar area of any club in
London.
The DJ’s were great, downstairs
playing funky house, with the two
floors above playing a selection of
House and Indie-Electro.
Headlining the event was the
House producer Sebastien Leger,
playing a super set till 6am, along
with a host of other big name DJs
keeping guests entertained until
nearly midday the next day! We
didn’t quite last that long though.
Bugged Out Warehouse Party
Canvas
Friday 19 January
★★★★★
Hearing that the mighty Bugged
Out were planning a super awe-
some mega Ed Bangers party in
some sort of underground car park
near Old Street I couldn’t possi-
bly resist the temptation to go and
check it out.
Well, it turns out the car park ven-
ue fell through a week or so before
the event so they swiftly relocated to
the mighty Canvas in Kings Cross.
Perhaps a good move, perhaps not
- I was hoping for a more ‘under-
ground’ feel to this event making a
welcome change from the standard
super club type atmosphere com-
mon with this type of music, but oh
well - I wasn’t planning on buying
drinks anyway so the £4 bottles of
beer at Canvas made no difference
to me!
We arrived early (10:30pm) an-
ticipating a huge queue but to our
surprise (and dismay) the place
seemed deserted, had we arrived at
the wrong venue? Confusing. Even-
tually it turned out we were at the
right place, but were unfashionably
early. 30 minutes of waiting around
we were finally in! Hooray, the DJ
playing the opening hours was ok,
playing a mix of the standard elec-
tro and indie we all expected along
with some rather dubious nu-met-
al/classic rock re-mixes.
Taking a seat on a sofa we looked
around the place. Now glad it
wasn’t in some scummy car park,
we admired the lovely decorations
around the place, somewhat point-
less we reasoned, since soon no-
body would be able to focus on it
anyway. On that note, we made our
way to the dance floor for 5 hours of
pounding electronic beats.
Uffie made her appearance first,
and had definitely improved her
live performance since we saw
Clockwise from top: The potty mouthed Uffie - French, but seemingly
sporting shaved armpits. Justice - One guy does the work, the other
waves his arms. Busy P - Manages Daft Punk and owns two watches.
her at last, actually able to sing
the lyrics and engaging with the
crowd much more, albeit by letting
a horde of pilled up guys grope her
breasts and babble into the micro-
phone when she passed it to them,
she gave quite a fun show, passing
the stage to Feadz who delivered a
perfect set the almighty Justice to
follow onto.
Playing from 2am till 4am, the
French duo kept the almost 1000
revellers more than happy during
the course of the night.
They were almost as good as
when we saw them at Our Disco
but I think that’s just down to the
atmosphere (it was very hot at
Canvas).
Busy P ended the night off, so we
left it at that, walking home in the
early morning light, recovering our
normal heartbeat and looking for-
ward to 15 hours of restless sleep.

New residency at The End this month
the club on a regular basis is an
understatement.
If there’s one producer who can
be relied on to buck the trends and
do what the hell he likes, it has to be
James Holden. In a current climate
that seems obsessed with stripping
tracks down to the bare bones, he
manages to produce tunes with
such depth that you could get lost in
them - even equipped with an ordi-
nance survey map, satellite naviga-
tion device and homing pigeon. In
his DJ sets he rips tracks apart and
splices them back together giving
you snatches of what you thought
you knew, before taking you some-
where else entirely.
He set up his Border Community
label in 2003 with the intention of re-
leasing “music that doesn’t fit into a
category”. And he certainly seems
to be fulfilling his aim: releases on
the label jump from peak time tech-
no to floaty ambient downtempo
material, but all with a beautiful,
slightly wonky, distorted feel and
a nod to something more ethereal
and other-worldly.
James Holden will head up the
line-up at each Border Community
night, joined by some of his fellow
Border Community cases and like
minded guests. At the first party,
very special guest Nathan Fake will
be performing live. Nathan’s debut
album, ‘Drowning in a Sea of Love’
released in 2006, was a spine tin-
gling collection of almost psyche-
delic-sounding surreal electronica,
with stand out track ‘The Sky was
Pink’ getting a fine reworking by
James Holden and becoming one of
the biggest undergrounds anthems
of last year.
Completing the line up in The End
is German techno wizard Dominik
Eulberg, whilst Kieran Hebden aka
Four Tet gets all experimental on
us in the lounge. Up in AKA, the
Luke Solomon’s Little Creatures
residency, with guest Chris Duck-
enfield, digs up the finest discofied
house and techno for your drinking,
dancing and listening pleasure.
The launch promises to be a night
of some of the most forward-look-
ing, mind blowing music around
– Border Community adds another
fantastic night to Saturday night’s
‘As One’ parties at The End & AKA.
Look out for a review in and up-
coming issue of Felix.
Mark your diaries, cancel your
plans – as Saturday 12th May her-
alds a very important date in The
End’s clubbing calendar.
James Holden launches his Bor-
der Community night at The End
– joined in the main room by Nath-
an Fake doing a special live per-
formance and Dominik Eulberg.
James Holden’s previous sets at
the club for Cocoon and Circo Loco
have made The End’s main room
seriously kick off – so to say we are
excited about having him take over
