Cricketeers thrash City’s brightest
Having enjoyed our time abroad, it
was time for the competitive sea-
son to begin, but unlike last year
our promotion in the BUSA league
meant tougher opposition. First
BUSA game, City 1st XI.
We were off to a quick start cour-
tesy of our yellow Imperial College
Union minibus, fully kitted out with
a tape player and wireless. Anura
Malaweera (Honey Monster)
quickly ceased upon the oppor-
tunity to play a Pop Mix of Cyndi
Lauper’s “Girls Just Wanna Have
Fun”. Anura was promptly moved
to the back seat.
Soon enough we arrived at what
appeared to be City’s home ground
i.e. an uncut wicket, no boundaries
or pitch markings. In fact, it was a
field.
Unfortunately we couldn’t bring
our lawnmower to the game, but
City were adamant that they could
get it ready in time (of course they
couldn’t). We attempted to sneak-
ily fit our 50 over game on an adja-
cent ground unnoticed. Unluckily
for us, the 2 other teams who had
hired out the ground were on the
ball. They shrewdly noticed the ex-
tra 22 players warming up on their
ground. Sure enough a forfeit was
in order. However whilst signing
the relevant documentation, the
City captain got a call from one
of his clan; another ground was
available.
Cutting a long story short (no pun
intended), we elected to field first
in a reduced 35 over per side game.
Zirgham “Zippy” Afridi bowled an
incredible reverse swinging dead
straight low beamer which took the
City opener with the 1st ball of the
innings. Perfect start; that is until
City’s lower order (2 and 3) came
to the party.
Almaher “I have no nickname”
Shelley and Zippy kept them qui-
et for a while, but they soon got
stuck into the rest of the bowling.
That is until Gibbon (Luke Gibson)
stepped up to take their opener
with the first ball.
City, not content to have 2 bats-
man on the pitch at any one time,
decided to call out a 3rd person to
run for their unfit number 3, need-
less to say the confusion of having
an extra batsman was too great for
the City boys. He was promptly run
out by the length of the pitch.
Pranav “Baby Face” Ullal and
Gibbon continued to bowl with
great distinction. City batsmen
were dropping like flies, finish-
ing with a score of 209 off their
35 overs; a score which deserved
“bare” respect.
The pitch was terrible, you could
bowl a bouncer or a pea-roller if you
pitched the ball on a good length.
Both Kyle “Santa” Santos and “I
have no nickname” succumbed to
the latter.
Meanwhile Thilina “The Ma-
chine” Ambepitiya continued to
smash the ball to all parts. Abeetha
“Pingpong” Perrera offered some
support, before he attempted to
pull a yorker.
Vaibhav Weeman Kumar ran to
the crease, eagerly anticipating
his first ball of the season.
The very next ball Leon “Abdul”
Loveridge came in and conse-
quently built a partnership with
The Machine; that is until Thil
supposedly middled the ball to the
keeper, ending his greatest inning
in 4 seasons for IC (though he did
have the consolation of a half cen-
tury). Honey Monster thought the

Imperial 1st XI vs
City University 1st XI
Imperial: 210-9 (Loveridge
52*, Ambepitiya 50) bt City
University 209-9 (Ullal 30-4,
Gibson 31-3) by 1 wicket
best way to cheer the captain up
would be to race Leon to one end of
the pitch. This did not work. Anura
was run out by 2/3 of the pitch. Well
done Anura.
But as batsmen continued to be
triggered, the real star of the show
came to the fore. It was nail biting
action as it came down to our last
pair. Loveridge showed his true
class crunching a 4 to shepherd IC
home to a 1 wicket victory. Pitch
invasion.... what a legend.
This was the best run chase in IC
history, 6 an over on a poor wicket
against brass opposition was no
mean feat. This team showed a
true ‘never say die’ mindset. At no
point did they give up, at no point
did they doubt themselves; they
were strong, stronger than any
other previous IC team. This was
the Machine’s Machine. There’s a
lot more to come from these boys.
“The Machine” pauses on his way to a half-century for a brief staring match with the ball
