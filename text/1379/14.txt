It’s been far too long since we’ve
had a proper crossword in these
pages - all of our setters have been
busy with other commitments
(revision, exams, life, etc.) for quite
some time.
But at last, here’s one with real
clues. Hopefully enjoyable ones,
too. It’s probably the best one I’ve
written all year, and it shouldn’t be
too hard, either. Nor too easy, of
course.
If anyone has the time or inclina-
tion to set a crossword or two over
the coming weeks, please get in
touch with Felix - we’d appreciate
any additional setters we can lay
our hands on.

Send your answers to sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk or bring this page
down to the Felix office in the West Wing of Beit Quad by Wednesday
9am. Each week, we’ll choose a winner and give them the princely sum of
ten shiny British pounds. If they turn out not to be shiny, we will person-
ally polish them for you. If they turn out not to be British, we could all be
in very deep trouble. They will be British, though. That’s a promise.
