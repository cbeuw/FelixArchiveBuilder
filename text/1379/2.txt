“Channel 4’s recent broadcast of
Martin Durkin’s “The Great Global
Warming Swindle” demonstrated
admirably that the media has little
issue with generating controversy
purely to serve its own purposes,
even if those responsible for
the content have a history of
complaints upheld against them
by the Independent Television
Commission.”

Disgruntled
“Sir Richard Sykes is probably
quite pleased with himself at the
moment: independence for Impe-
rial College and a listing in the top
ten of world universities. But, via
Felix, I would like to ask him the
following questions.”

Werner Herzog
“As German cinema has been
creeping into the limelight in the
last few years (the Oscar win
of The Lives of Others – even
if controversial – being the just
reward for their recent “exports”)
I turn to look at one of the major
German directors of the 20th
century.”

“Hearing that the mighty Bugged
Out were planning a super

in some sort of underground car

Off the rails
“I tell you what – I’m kind of glad
we have digital watches. And not
just digital watches, but Annie
Lennox too. And processed
cheese. See, I’m not glad we’ve
got these things individually, but
the whole “modern” package is
pretty appealing. Mainly because it
stops me from scrabbling around
amongst ferns, foraging for food,
while bludgeoning others to death
with pieces of flint.”

This week’s stories
The already dubious Internet con-
nections supplied in the £130-a-
week Unite halls across London
went down for almost an entire
week during crucial revision time
for some unlucky students at either
Orient House or Piccadilly Court.
Angry students could be heard
screaming with rage at the pain-
fully slow connections and multiple
timeouts whilst trying to access
past papers of lecture notes to re-
vise for impending exams.
The fact that both halls are at
least 40 minutes travel away from
college made it all the more frus-
trating for students who have few
lectures this term (and therefore
no reason to be in college), and who
take the sensible decision to revise
in their rooms rather than the 30-de-
gree library. They are encouraged
by their departments to download
course material from the Imperial
College website for revision, as well
as check emails at least twice a day
in case of important information re-
garding tutorials, exams or revision
classes.
Connectivity has now been re-
stored in Unite halls according to
u-want (the Unite ISP) technical
support, but during the ‘upgrade’
numerous students have had their
network port blocked by the ISP
due to ‘suspect virus infections’
which we can only assume they
are using as one of the excuses as
to why their ‘40x faster than dialup’
internet connections were going
slower than a 1980s modem.
Some frustrated residents of the
Unite halls claimed to be “losing
the plot and were considering de-
stroying their PC’s” they were so
aggravated by u-want, although
other students seemed to see the
brighter side claiming “At least I’m
not wasting all my time looking on
Facebook instead of working for my
exams”.
Incidentally, connections in Unite
halls costs £27 a month for a 2Mbit,
port-restricted connection with a
maximum of 3 devices allowed per
user (Imperial students don’t pay
this directly but it is unknown if
the £130 a week rent incorporates
the cost of internet). Compare this
to Be-Broadband who offer 24Mbit,
unrestricted access for £24 a month,
or even other Imperial College halls
who are directly connected to the
ICT network for free (~10Mbit). You
don’t need a maths PhD to work out
who’s getting ripped off.

What little has been happening while you’ve been revising
Felix last week
First up, an apology from us. Felix
didn’t go out last week, for a number
of reasons, including an editor on
leave for personal reasons, and a
serious shortage of staff (due to
exams and other reasons). We’re
sorry; it won’t happen again.
Who will be the next rector?
Sir Richard Sykes, the current rec-
tor of the College, will be departing
at the end of next year. However, his
replacement is due to be announced
in July, and rumours abound about
who will replace Sir Richard as
head of the ninth-best university in
the world.
Initial rumours that had been
circulated to Felix suggested that
Lord Browne, the now departed
chief executive officer of BP
, might
be offered the post. However, you
cannot fail to have noticed Lord
Browne recently suffered a horren-
dous fall from grace; an injuction
was denied on printing details about
his private life, which revealed that
he had been involved in a four-year
homosexual relationship with a Ca-
nadian, Jeff Chevalier, and had lied
to a judge about how he had met Mr
Chevalier.
Lord Browne has also accepted
“moral responsibility” (avoiding
any notion of legal responsibility)
for an explosion at a Texas oil re-
finery which killed 15 people and in-
jured 180 more. The Mail on Sunday
revealed that the company, under
Browne’s directions, had placed an
‘accounting value’ of £10m on an
employee’s life.
So, if not Browne, then who? Felix
hears that the College management
would prefer someone with more of
an academic background than Sir
Richard, who spent most of his life
working for GlaxoSmithKline as a
businessman. In fact, Sir Richard’s
style was initially criticised as “too
business-like”, with the rebrand-
ing of 2003-4 perceived as him at-
tempting to mould the College into
a business.
The name that Felix has heard Do u want it? Tough, it doesn’t work very well
mentioned is Professor Sir David
King, the current Chief Scientific
Advisor to the government. King
is an outspoken supporter of the
IPCC’s findings on global warming,
and has called climate change “one
of the greatest challenges facing
the UK today”.
A working group was formed by
the Union to be a forum for discuss-
ing what kind of rector the students
would like next, but this has come
to naught. It is unlikely that the Col-
lege will take any notice of student
demands on this front, and that in-
stead the process of selecting the
next rector will remain completely
opaque.
Southside delays
Felix has learnt that full opening
of Southside is likely to be delayed
until the end of October, which may
cause problems for the hordes of
incoming freshers. The College is
relying on Southside to be complete
in time for the start of the year, as it
is currently suffering from a dearth
of available accomodation.
Felix reported last term on how
the twin rooms in the building are
too small for habitation by two stu-
dents, but it now seems that they
will be used as doubles (despite be-
ing the size of some single rooms in
other halls).
In related news, plans to rede-
velop Eastside (Linstead Hall) in
a similar fashion to Southside, us-
ing the same prefabricating tech-
niques, may be put on hold as the
cost of the project has become
prohibitive.
Imperial 3rd in Guardian ranking
Imperial has been placed overall
third in the Guardian’s ranking of
UK universities, despite surveys
showing the College suffers from
poor student satisfaction ratings.
The Guardian rankings include
data from the National Student
Survey; Imperial was rated the low-
est out of the top 35 institutions.
Reasons cited include poor teach-
ing and extremely high workloads.
Southside construction delayed?
