I, Gamer
F
reedom, then. In fair-
ness, it’s not STALK-
ER that’s made me
think about it this
week – more that Fe-
lix’s press day is the last day of
my exams for the year. The last
day. Time off. The end.
But it’s a bit scary, you see.
Because it’s the end – no direc-
tion. No cramming. No dead-
lines to meet, no direction. Of
course, I can do anything I want
now – free to imbibe, inhale or
whatever else people do when
they have nothing else to. But
I don’t want to, because there’s
nothing to suggest it’s worth it.
Freedom can be a bit too free
sometimes. A bit too restrict-
ing in how open it is. Paradoxi-
cal though it might seem, since
freedom is all we strive for, and
it’s sure as hell is what I’ve
wanted since revision started,
but within a week I’ll be unsure
of what I’m doing. And then
what?
I’ve not played STALKER
yet, but I’ve heard plenty of sto-
ries of people just playing with
the world – setting up fights
between groups just to see how
the AI handles it, and the kind
of free-spirited experimenta-
tion that reminds me of the first
time I played Deus Ex. They’ve
made friends and enemies, had
emotions evoked in them, and
feel like they wove a story.
Since last week, where we
covered some of the top Indie
games, I’ve played both Facade
– which we did cover – and
Masq – which we didn’t. Two
games that use complete free-
dom as a way to engineer a new
kind of challenge. Masq offers
four choices at each stage, and
has a wide variety of different
endings. Facade offers an infi-
nite choice at each stage, but
only about three endings.
Which one is more satisfying?
For me, it’s Facade – the ability
to feel my choices are unique,
even if I see the same ending
quite often. In life, we make
choices uniquely, but only see
an ending once. Being restrict-
ed in our immediate choices is
less immersive than being re-
stricted in our end result.
And yet games like STALK-
ER don’t entirely fulfil me.
I’m more likely to fire up Max
Payne or Halo and play a story
through to the finish – linear
as hell, but at least I’ve got di-
rection, at least I’m experienc-
ing what the designers knew I
would.
Maybe I’m predictable, or
maybe I just know what I like.
Either way, I think I need a
summer job.

This Week In Videogaming
I
tell you what – I’m kind of glad
we have digital watches. And
not just digital watches, but
Annie Lennox too. And pro-
cessed cheese. See, I’m not
glad we’ve got these things individ-
ually, but the whole “modern” pack-
age is pretty appearling. Mainly be-
cause it stops me from scrabbling
around amongst ferns, foraging for
food, while bludgeoning others to
death with pieces of flint.
Capitalism – for all its flaws – does
have the saving grace of giving us
something to do.
Naturally, way back when, we had
nothing. It was a case of eat, or be
eaten; avoid missing ball for high
score; collect the dots and avoid
the ghosts. But as civilisation de-
veloped, we moved on. WE had sci-
entific compounds to escape from,
gangs to run missions for, princess-
es to save. We had reached a design
pinnacle. We were enlightened.
Lately, though, gaming in particu-
lar has suffered something of a fall.
We’ve got out priorities wrong, you
see. Games like Grand Theft Auto
gave us a sense of freedom, and
we thought we’d like some more.
So they tore a few walls down here
or there. Endings multiplies, and
then disappeared completely. Pro-
tagonists became duplicated, and
then entirely customisable. Diab-
lo’s dungeon searching gave way to
aimless wandering around Tamriel.
Leagues and ladders were replaced
by endless, meaningless death-
matches – and always on bloody
Zanzibar.
It’s the old days again, the bad
days. We’ve come full circle, and
to put it lightly it’s a bit of an
anticlimax.
It was the fault of multiplayer,
in part. Playing against humans
is visceral, and very immediate.
It was natural to want more, but
the more player vs. player you put
into a game, the less organised it
becomes.
When it’s done well, freedom is
just as liberating as the name im-
pliex. Take EVE Online, for exam-
ple, the seminal sci-fi MMO where
the game is so open-ended that
there’s virtually nothing in the
huge expanse of space that isn’t
caused or created by the players
themselves.
There’s no bleak, directionless
gaming here, though – here, there
are inter-corporation wars, hugh
political debates, and betrayal on
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. wants to set you free. But isn’t it much cosier in these chains?
Half-Life 2’s single-player was horribly linear - but it was supposed to be. Beckett would be proud.
an unimaginable scale. Scandals
such as the blueprint-smuggling
EVE employee, or the in-game
coup that cost a real-world equiva-
lent of $16,500 damage, are head-
line stories for gaming sites and
publications.
But EVE is a special case, and
these glamourous events are not
everyday. Sign up for a trial, and
you’ll more than likely find that
freedom in EVE’s deep space is
very realistic indeed – empty, and
devoid of much point.
Where have the real gaming
landmarks come from in the last
few years? Not through the unique
moments stumbled across in a
non-linear wasteland. It was those
shared moments, those holy-shit-
Master-Chief-is-riding-a-frigging-
bomb moments. It was when Aeris
died (OMG spoilers, indeed). It was
when you first held the gravity gun,
when Link first hopped onto Epona,
or the first home run you hit in Wii
Sports.
It’s why we remember the Doom
Marine, and not the Pong paddle,
why we cherish the Nova Prospekt
outskirts more than Q2DM6, and
why we tell people about holding
Yorda’s hand with more emotion
than we tell them about holding a
shotgun in FEAR Combat.
Life isn’t about what we uniquely
experience – it’s about what we
share with others. IT’s the con-
“And That Bit When...” The Top Moments You Didn’t Miss
MGS – Metal Gear Rex
You’d killed supernatural snipers,
powerful psychics and a tank, but
nothing quite matched the first
moment the missile-firing, metal-
scraping bitchmother itself kicked
into life, and you suddenly realised
you’d need a bigger pistol.
Medal of Honor – Omaha Beach
It wasn’t just a great gaming mo-
ment, it was the first of a new
generation. People died, and your
gun couldn’t do a damn thing. You
couldn’t do a damn thing, except
not get killed yourself. A genre-de-
fining moment.
Wind Waker – The High Seas
The sheer vastness of the ocean in
Wind Waker was enough to make
the garish visuals and new controls
all better. The beauty, the crispness,
the simplicity. It was Zelda, but with
a special kind of polish, that prom-
ised a great game.
Halo – The Maw, Pt. III
You’re belting through the guts of a
2km-long bomb, and the world is fit-
tingly going to hell. An epic sound-
track is bursting above the roar of
the warthog, and time is running
out. Frustrating, overlong, but un-
believably awe-inspiring.
nection we make through things
we all went through. It’s like being
in ‘Nam, but less impressive. And
more controversial.
Fortunately, linearity isn’t dead
yet. Half-Life 2’s episodes continue
to entertain, LucasArts are pushing
into new realms of epic storytelling,
and designers like Miyamoto, Ko-
jima and Mikami still firmly believe
in the power of the narrative.
But linearity is a dirty word now,
associate with oppression, unfair-
ness and plain bad design. Open-
ended games like Spore are poised
to hit linearity right out of the park.
And then all we’ll have left will be
memories of processed cheese, and
a battered copy of Deus Ex.
