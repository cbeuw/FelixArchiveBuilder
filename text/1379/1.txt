Queen’s Lawn
off-limits for
six months
The Queen’s Lawn will be unusable
by staff and students until at least
October, as the College have decid-
ed not to disassemble the marquee
that provides extra function space
for events during the summer term
and beyond.
In previous years, the lawn has
seen marquees be put together and
taken apart as needed, allowing
students to use the grass during
the stressful exam period for some
well-needed relaxation in pleasant
weather. This year, however, the
marquee (which occupies almost
the entirety of the lawn) will remain
in place throughout the summer
term and into the start of the next
academic year.
The reason for this change in pol-
icy is that the College has a number
of Centenary events planned be-
sides the usual functions, such
as the Summer Ball (renamed to
the Centenary Ball this year). The
marquee has been trumpted by the
College’s press department as the
largest ever assembled on campus;
Sir Richard even saw fit to mention
its majestic proportions at his grad-
uation address in the Great Hall on
Wednesday.
The College has internally booked
events planned until 25th October;
there are, however, large gaps be-
tween some events (almost a month
between 11 May and 8 June, for ex-
ample) where the marquee could
have been disassembled so stu-
dents and staff could use the lawn.
The College has indicated that it
will be looking for external book-
ings, no doubt using the prestige
of the institution to attract a sub-
stational fee. So far, nine external
bookings have been provisionally
booked, with more likely to follow;
these will occupy the marquee for a
total of 23 days.
The marquee has already caused
some problems for students: Dram-
Soc, who had planned to put on a
play on the lawn during this term,
are now restricted to the small strip
of lawn facing the Sir Alexander
Fleming Building.
The Lawn is one of the last green
spaces available to staff and stu-
dents at the College; Princes Gar-
dens, once a gorgeous leafy retreat,
has been reduced to a shadow of its
former glory by the nearby building
works on Southside, and the loss of
the bar there.
One positive aspect of the mar-
quee is that it will provide covered
space for next year’s Freshers’ Fair,
something that was sorely lacking
this year due to the Beit building
redevelopment.
The last event using the marquee
is on the 25th of October, and the
College have said it will not be dis-
mantlingituntilDecember,atwhich
point the lawn will be re-turfed.
