Atmospheric physics: spooky!
An interview with Imperial’s Professor Joanna Haigh starts off this issue, which focusses on climate science
In 2001, IC’s Professor Joanna
Haigh was the only female Pro-
fessor of Atmospheric Physics in
Britain. Ceri Perkins went to meet
Prof. Haigh to find out about her
research and discuss her views on
the current climate change debate.
What attracted you to study
atmospheric physics? What is the
focus of your current research?
I did a physics degree many years
ago, at the end of which I thought
that I never wanted to do any phys-
ics ever again! When I sat down to
consider what it was that I actually
enjoyed, I realised that it was stud-
ying the environment, and in partic-
ular the weather. I’d actually had a
weather station in my back garden
since my school days – I was a real
geek! I took an MSc in Meteorology
at Imperial, and followed that with
a DPhil in Atmospheric Physics at
Oxford. It was very theoretical, but
it’s amazing how motivated you can
be when you have a personal inter-
est in the topic!
My current research covers
transport of solar radiation in the
atmosphere. Specifically, over the
last few years I’ve been looking at
the relationship between solar irra-
diance and climate.
Do you think that the prospect of
tackling the climate change issue
is attracting more women to the
subject?
Our research group certainly
attracts a larger proportion of fe-
male PG students than any other
research group in physics at IC. I
put it down to the fact that women
are more attracted to environmen-
tal issues. I think it’s also a case of
women seeing other women doing
well in the field, which generates in-
terest. We support each other!
What do you see as the role of
climate scientists?
Our job is to explain and under-
stand the fundamental science go-
ing on, and to relay that information
to policy makers. Climate predic-
tion needs to be based on solid sci-
ence, not politics and polemic.
How have you seen public atti-
tudes to the climate change issue
change over time?
That area has become much less
pleasant; the debate has become
polarised. You’ve got environmen-
tal activists on one side, and peo-
ple who deny the existence of a
problem, or at least one caused by
human activity, on the other. Cur-
rently, there doesn’t seem to be
much of a middle ground where we
can outline frankly what we do and
don’t know. On the basis of what
we do know, we think that human
activity is influencing the climate,
but this understanding includes er-
ror bars and uncertainties. It’s dif-
ficult to put over to the public these
uncertainties.
Do you think the press have had
a significant role in polarising the
debate?
Yes, but then that’s the way that
they always do things. People have
exploited the press. The press do
have a tendency to exaggerate, but
they don’t fabricate stories.
It has been argued that Global
Climate Model (GCM) predictions
are weak as they fail to account
properly for spatial variations in
cloud thickness, or the extent to
which radiation is reflected by ice
at the poles. Where do you stand
on this?
It is very difficult to simulate
clouds. I agree that the spatial reso-
lution in the models is not good, and
that the detailed physical process-
es of cloud formation are not well
accounted for. Whilst the models do
have reasonable representations of
many features, such as the Inter-
tropical Convergence Zone and El
Niño, others, for example the diur-
nal variation of tropical convection
clouds over Africa, are less well
described. Representing the physi-
cal properties of ice is also difficult.
The question is to what extent we
can use model predictions as a ba-
sis from which to respond to green-
house gas (GHG) emissions. The
physics as we know it is in there
and we do know that models of the
current and historical climates
correspond well to observed and
measured values. This allows us to
place reasonable confidence in the
models’ predictions.
What about the arguments which
blame climate change on natural
variability and long-term cycles?
Clearly there is natural variation:
we’re dealing with a hugely com-
plex system. Using data from both
very long runs of models – where
we can look at the internal noise in
system – and oxygen isotopes in ice
cores, it would appear that changes
over the last 50 years have been
outside the bounds of natural vari-
ation. There may have been larger
temperature changes in the past,
but these changes occurred over
much longer time-scales.
Is it possible to tackle climate
change at the governmental level,
or does the action need to come
from individuals? Are initiatives
such as carbon emissions trading
really just token gestures which
detract from the real issue: that
people’s energy consumption
habits need to change?
It most definitely needs to be
tackled on a personal level, but the
government has a role to play too.
People have little choice in how
their power is generated. It is un-
likely that there will be any real dif-
ference made without government
litigation. The smoking ban is a
great example of where legislation
can give people that little push in
the right direction.
Even if the USA and Australia
were to join up, is Kyoto enough?
No, it’s not. Even if GHG emis-
Can YOU take the heat? A SOHO image of our nearest star
sions were capped at today’s levels,
warming would continue for well
over 50 years due to the inertia in
the oceans.
Why are certain areas of the
public still resistant to the idea of
climate change?
A mixture of reasons. Principally,
people don’t like to be told what
to do and they don’t like the idea
of changing their behaviour. They
don’t make rational decisions based
on the bigger picture, they just think
about how changes will impact
upon them personally. There is also
a political angle which sees people
with business interests resistant to
being told that industry is partly to
blame for the changes we’re begin-
ning to see.
Recent research by Henrik Sven-
smark suggests that the seeding
of tropospheric clouds by cosmic
rays may be responsible for cli-
mate change, not anthropogenic
GHGs. This has also been picked
up on Channel 4’s “The Great
Climate Change Swindle”, and in
Nigel Calder’s book “The Chilling
Stars: A New Theory of Climate
Change”. Where do you stand on
this?
You’ve got to turn the argument
around. If this is responsible for
the warming over the past 50 years,
then why haven’t we seen similar
effects in the past? This isn’t to
say that solar phenomenon have
no effect. Our understanding of the
effects of the 11–year solar cycle
on climate, for example, is statisti-
cally robust, but we can’t explain
Global Warming over the last 150
years through solar activity alone.
The cosmoclimatology article is a
gross simplification of the original
research, although the simplifica-
tion in this case was actually done
by one of the authors of the original
article!
What is your response to people
who claim that science is not
joined up enough? Do you think
that greater integration of the
different disciplines would have
anything to offer the climate
change debate?
Yes, in the sense that we might
know how to direct our understand-
ing to the areas where it is of most
use. But we do need to exercise
caution when taking that attitude.
So-called ‘Earth System Models’
which take into account the atmos-
phere, ocean, biosphere, economics
and everything in between run the
risk of propagating errors as each
part of the system is subject to its
own uncertainties.
Not at all scary really, despite our feeble title (though that picture of the sun could intimidate weaker
minds); Professor Haigh researches the relationship between solar irradiance and climate
