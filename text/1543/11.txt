How do you organise a space
conference? Planet.
leven students from the
Imperial College Students
for the Exploration and
Development of Space
society (shortened to
ICSEDS for obvious reasons) attended
the National Student Space Confer-
ence 2013 at the University of Bristol
last weekend.
he conference is organised every
year by UKSEDS, the UK’s national
student space society, features talks,
a careers fair, and lots of drinking,
drawing students from all over the
country.
Imperial students chatted to pio-
neering engineer Alan Bond, the man
behind the Skylon space plane, and
Dr David Parker, the CEO of the UK
Space Agency, as well as representa-
tives from Astrium, Reaction Engines,
and SciSys.
In an eﬀort to dispel their reputa-
tions as dull space geeks, UKSEDS or-
ganised a networking reception with
copious amounts of free wine donated
by the Royal Astronomical Society,
followed by a 25th anniversary boat
party featuring plenty of cringe-wor-
thy just-barely-space-related music.
UKSEDS’ annual general meeting
saw the election of four Imperial stu-
dents to the national organising com-
mittee, Andy Lamb (1st year Physi-
cist), Zoë Versey (4th year Aero), and
TeeJay Taiwo (2nd year Aero), Joseph
E
Joseph Dudley shoots for the stars
Dudley (1st year Aero) become Treas-
urer, Events Officer, Projects Officer,
and Membership Officer respectively,
making Imperial the most represent-
ed university on the committee.
Joseph Dudley, Vice-Chair of
ICSEDS said “Imperial had one of the
highest turnouts at the conference, we
were the only branch to have a poster,
and we got four people elected to the
national committee. A really great re-
sult, and a tribute to the dedication of
ICSEDS’ members.”
In addition to dominating UKSEDS’
committee, ICSEDS has plans to be-
come the hub for a London based
SEDS group that will feature collabo-
ration with groups at Kingston, UCL,
and KCL, as well as the British Inter-
planetary Society whose headquarters
are in Vauxhall.
ICSEDS is open to anyone interest-
ed in space. Current projects include
high-powered model rocketry, high
altitude ballooning, and design of a
ramjet engine. It gives you the chance
to learn new skills working on hands-
on projects, and to meet other space
nuts/valuable industry contacts at
awesome space events. ICSEDS and
UKSEDS are part of a global SEDS
network that started at MIT in 1980
and features many prominent space
ﬁgures as alumni. For more informa-

Last weekend saw the battle of the
dance teams in the UK’s largest uni-
versity dance competition at Lough-
borough. For the ﬁrst time ever, Fun-
kology represented Imperial in the
most contested category, Advanced
Hip-hop, up against stiﬀ competition
from previous winners.
heir set revolved around the theme
of money, with songs ranging from
Macklemore’s hrift Shop to Ma-
donna’s Material Girl, choreographed
by Carlo Frem, Adrianna Liu, Derek
Mok and Chris Wood. To add to their
dance moves, the routine included fur
coats and inappropriate touching, all
ending in an explosion of fake money
used to “bribe” the judges.
he previously unheard of dance so-
ciety soon emerged as the dark horses
as they went to win the most coveted
First Place in Advanced Hip-hop and
also Best Male, awarded to the deserv-
ing SuviChak hongborisoot.
Feedback from the judges was noth-
ing but praise, some commenting at
the surprise that “Imperial known for
its smarts had such a creative dance
society” and star of “So You hink
You Can Dance” tweeting photos with
the fake money acknowledging their
achievement.
