Brian May and Roger Taylor from
Queen were at Imperial in Metric on
Tuesday 5 March to unveil a plaque
commemorating their ﬁrst public per-
formance, which took place in the Un-
ion Concert Hall.
he event was greeted with much
enthusiasm by all present, with Paul
Beaumont, Union President, giving
in a speech in the traditional rock and
roll attire of a suit. Beaumont said:
“We’re very proud of Imperial Col-
lege Union’s musical past, including
the small role we played in the Queen
story. It’s a privilege to host a plaque
commemorating the band’s ﬁrst Lon-
don performance here and to wel-
come them back here today.”
he event was a music Heritage
Award from PRS for Music. Brian May
said: “he ﬁrst proper gig we did was
at Imperial College in the Union Hall.
I remember it very distinctly because
I’d seen all sorts of people playing in
there. I’d been part of the Entertain-
ment Committee and we booked a
group every Saturday night in those
days. People like Spooky Tooth and
Steamhammer! We booked Jimi Hen-
drix too. So for us it was a dream come
true to actually play on that stage. It
used to get packed in there so it was
a major stepping stone for us.” Roger
Taylor continued: “Imperial College
was eﬀectively our positional and spir-
itual base and means a lot to Queen.
Many good memories, without it...
who knows?”.
Guy Fletcher 0BE, PRS Chair, said:
“Loved by millions the world over,
they were often thought of as the
People’s Band. Queen’s songwriting
originality combined musicianship
with real life emotion sustaining gen-
erations of dedicated fans. It will be
an enormous honour to present Brian
and Roger with the PRS for Music
Heritage award at such a ﬁne institu-
tion.
A plucky George Butcher from IC
Radio asked Brian and Roger if they
would consider doing a live session for
them.
After that everyone got pictures and
autographs. Including one lucky stu-
dent, who got Brian to sign his guitar
for him.
he actual plaque itself will be
placed outside on Prince Consort
Road, after a brief stint in Metric.
