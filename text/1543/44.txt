FRIDAY 08 MARCH 45
“Whaam!” is probably one of the most
reproduced pieces of art on the plan-
et. hat bold comic style, that distinc-
tive script, the perfect coloured dots...
he piece is so distinctively Lichten-
stein that it has perhaps come to de-
ﬁne him as an artist. However as this
retrospective shows, Roy Lichtenstein
is so much more than that.
Around the time when he was play-
ing around with comic strips and
‘Benday dots’, Lichtenstein was also
experimenting with sculpture, and
while I am not normally a fan, I could
not help but enjoy some of his massive
monochrome installations. Perhaps it
is because I am quite into my writing
(and stationery!), but an absolutely
giant version of one of those clas-
sic ‘compositions’ notebooks got me
genuinely excited about the potential
for the massive stories and ideas they
might contain. Meanwhile I found
myself unexpectedly moved looking
into one of his ‘mirrors’, and ﬁnding
that I had no reﬂection; as though he
had somehow managed to immerse
my character completely within his
art. Lichtenstein has a way of looking
at things, a way of understanding both
the cultural identity and physical ge-
ometry of his subject matter, through
which by reducing them to lines and
colours he somehow manages to make
them say more.
In contrast, the comic strip paint-
ings that made Lichtenstein famous
did little for me. Perhaps it is be-
cause by now they have become so
overused, so synonymous with the
very idea of pop-art, that it is kind
of impossible to have a fresh opinion
about them. Also, not being much of
a comic-reader myself, I have very lit-
tle pre-Lichtenstein comic imagery in
my head for the pieces to play oﬀ of or
tap into. Meanwhile the commentary
he makes in the pieces about gender
roles in American society are, I think,
better expressed by his earlier and
simpler works.
However, Lichtenstein’s interpreta-
tion of the subject of female nudes is
the only one I have ever liked. I am
not sure why, although perhaps it is
because the naked women he depicts
are having fun for once. For the ﬁrst
time ever, I did not question why
these women were naked and vul-
nerable, nor his agenda, but instead
appreciated his classic dotty, colour-
ful treatment of them, the beautiful
curved lines, the clever layering of
patterns and imagery. In fact, such is
Lichtenstein’s sensitivity to the social
context of his work that the women’s
choice and style of clothes, had they
been wearing any, would probably
have said more about them and in that
way been more distracting than their
nakedness.
His unusual series on landscapes
and seascapes however were not quite
so powerful or engaging for me. It
was not that they were not technically
good, or emotive, but by restricting
himself to sparse broad brushstrokes
or sheets of bendy plastic, Lichten-
stein prevented his own distinctive
style from emerging through. (It does
not help that the depiction of a sunset
has been done many times before, and
by some very, very good artists.) He
also produced some fairly weird and
abstract installations during his ‘mod-
ern’ phase, such as a recreation of a
classic red velvet rope strung between
two golden posts, such as one might
ﬁnd in a fancy theatre, that seemed
just too far removed from any human
touch for me to emotionally respond
to.
But that is the magic of a retrospec-
tive. By spanning over 40 years of
work of an incredibly interesting and
surprisingly varied artist, you feel like
you really are getting a chance to see
everything Lichtenstein did; the good,
the bad and the ugly. And by seeing
everything, from his self-conscious
early works and studies, before he
had really found his footing as a pop-
artist, to his later experiments with
the styles of artists wildly diﬀerent
to his own, you begin to understand
Lichtenstein in some way, and realise
that he is quite a special artist. Every
piece of his art seems completely un-
self-centred and yet distinctly his. He
has real talent but does not make you
feel guilty or intimidated for not hav-
ing the same. Most of all, Lichtenstein
seems to just really enjoy making his
art.
