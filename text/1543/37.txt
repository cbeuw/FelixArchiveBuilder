What happens when we tell stories about science?
Sarah Byrne Science Writer
What does happen when we tell sto-
ries about science? hat was the ques-
tion the panel of academics attempted
to answer at the LSE/Imperial Literary
Festival event last Wednesday even-
ing.
he aims described at the begin-
ning were both ambitious and a bit
vague. We were going to examine the
relationship between science and nar-
rative, and see science escaping from
the lab into the ‘real’ world, where we
would examine whether its ‘state’ was
‘altered’. What actually happened was
that each panellist simply told a story
of their own, giving a diﬀerent per-
spective on science and technology,
followed by a more general discussion.
Greg Artus, Imperial philosophy
and ethics lecturer, recounted the ac-
tivities of Annie Ducan, the infamous
forensic chemist jailed for falsifying
vast amounts of evidence. his exam-
ple of a corrupt and criminal scientist
was supposed to be a counterpoint to
the ‘story’ we tell ourselves about how
science is pure and rariﬁed. here was
maybe a bit of a lack of self-awareness
here; does anyone really believe
that scientists are anything
but human? Could this itself
be a ‘story’ that smug hu-
manities types tell them-
selves? Where is the
evidence that it’s
true?
Next up, Richard
Bronk from LSE’s
European Institute
was not the most
charismatic or
engaging speak-
er. Reading
from notes, he
sounded more
like he was
r e c i t i n g
an es-
say than
telling a
story. But he
was well worth the eﬀort of listening
t o , actually having some of the
most profound in-
sights. Stories, he
said, are essential.
hey’re the way
we make sense
of the
c o m -
plex reality
around us.
hey’re like
lanterns il-
luminating
the truth,
but like
real lan-
terns they
only show
us a limited
area at a time.
To see the
full picture,
you need
more than
one story, more than one viewpoint:
sticking to one traditional narrative is
not enough.
Aifric Campbell, novelist, ex-banker
and creative writing lecturer at Impe-
rial, showed us how storytelling was
done, with a three-decade-spanning,
second-person present-tense narra-
tive about the emergence of complex
mathematics in ﬁnance. he moral of
the story was the way the language/
culture divide between scientists and
non-scientists hampers communica-
tion and understanding, and the very
bad outcomes this can lead to.
Finally Imperial’s professor of sur-
gery Roger Kneebone made everyone
laugh with his misadventures in sci-
ence engagement, speciﬁcally his con-
troversial strategy of staging drama-
tized medical emergencies without
the audience’s knowledge. he key
message here seemed to be the impor-
tance of emotional engagement in sci-
ence communication, but also how it
can be a double-edged sword.
Once the discussion was opened
up to questions, things started to get
more philosophical. Some scientists
in the audience might have been start-
ing to get uncomfortable at this point,
with the tendency to equate science
with stories, and it was a relief when
someone raised the point that must
have been on many people’s minds.
Once we start talking about truth as
narrative, scientiﬁc ﬁndings as stories
we tell ourselves, how far does that
take us down the road of postmodern-
ism? Don’t we end up in the dubious
position of arguing that truth is rela-
tive, science is only one way of view-
ing the world and no more or less valid
than any other opinion or story?
Answering that was left to a ﬁnal
bit of stealth-eloquence from Richard
Bronk. Quoting Wordsworth he de-
scribed how we ‘half-create’ the world:
that there is objective truth, but there
are also stories, and together, insepa-
rable, they make up our understand-
ing of reality. And on that point, both
scientists and philosophers can prob-
ably agree.
Graphene: Ready to revolutionise solar power
Yes, that’s right. You might have heard
of graphene already. his Christmas
the government invested £22 million
into the so dubbed ‘super-material’.
Imperial College London received
£4.5 million, which, distributed be-
tween 3 research projects, hopes to
contribute to the international quest
for graphene technologies.
Graphene has astonished scientists
around the world with its fantastic
electrical conductivity and mechani-
cal properties. Soon after its discov-
ery in 2004 (for which the researchers
won the 2010 Noble Prize in Physics)
people started saying that it would
shake the silicon empire to pieces and
bring about a new technological era.
Graphene seems to have much more
to say.
Last week a paper published in Na-
ture Physics attributes another fan-
tastic property to graphene: it can
efficiently convert light into electric-
ity. he research, undertaken by he
Institute of Photonic Sciences of Bar-
celona (www.icfo.eu) is indeed highly
exciting.
Why?
Current solar cells are expensive to
produce and not that efficient. Eﬀorts
to make them out of other materials
have not quite culminated yet. he
incorporation of graphene into the
ﬁeld brings new hopes and possibili-
ties. Last week Spanish newspaper La
Vanguardia published that the unex-
Amanda Diez Science Writer pected results could have an impact
equivalent to the development of plas-
tics in the 20th century.
So how does this conversion of light
into electricity work?
Conventionally semiconductors
such as silicon are used. hey have
the property of conducting electricity
neither brilliantly nor poorly. Some-
how this mediocrity makes them ab-
solutely great. he how is as follows:
electrons cannot be accelerated by an
electric ﬁeld (and hence conduct elec-
tricity) because in order to do so they
would have to enter forbidden energy
levels of the material.
However, if by some means they
reach the empty energy levels above
the forbidden region they are free.
Free to move, accelerate, conduct
electricity or whatever else you want.
How can they achieve this? Light. En-
lightenment. he electrons are danc-

We have been reliably informed that
this funky image is science-related
ing around the material when sud-
denly a photon (an energy packet of
light) hits them on the head much like
an intruding asteroid. Due to a much
more celestial coincidence than New-
ton’s apple they are suddenly (if the
energy packet is large enough) put in a
(high and allowed) energy state. Since
most high energy states are empty and
free to access they can now accelerate
as much as they want. Due to the po-
tential gradient created by the diﬀer-
ent materials of the cell, the electrons
actually do want to accelerate and nat-
urally do so, thus creating a current.
All this explanation was actually
useless and just for fun because gra-
phene is not a semiconductor. he
message to take home however is that
if electrons are put into a higher en-
ergy state they relax back to a lower
state, releasing heat (which is useless
and also a nuisance). Hence, a lot of
the high-energy radiation is lost into
heat making it all very inefficient. In
graphene, when the electrons relax,
they give that energy to other elec-
trons which can then also conduct
electricity (they are very generous in-
deed). his means more energy from
the radiation is converted into elec-
tricity, making it an absolutely excel-
lent material, as we all already knew.
