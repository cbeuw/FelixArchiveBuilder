FRIDAY 08 MARCH
48
Resolutely delivered chords resound
through the body of the listener and
entice them through Richard Allan’s
songs. He explores fundamental ideas
and emotions and presents them, bare,
to the listener. he frequent poise of
the melodies on the break of his voice,
which he tightrope walks with captivat-
ing purity, reinforces the raw emotion,
and the gritty insistence implies frus-
tration. But the tracks are not doom
and gloom. Instead the lyrics evoke the
feeling of contemplative resolution and
this, I think, is what makes Richard’s
music clever. Richard has been sing-
ing and song-writing for years and it
shows. He is at one with his guitar and
his newly formed band is already well-
integrated, contributing beautifully
understated vocal harmonies, drum
beats and bass lines. he rhythm and
meandering tempo of Richard’s song
“Show Me he Way” feels comfortably
familiar and this song, in particular,
will resonate. And it is a pleasure to
become familiar with the songs. Inﬂu-

ences such as Patrick Watson and Jack
Steadman (Bombay Bicycle Club) are
hinted at by fragile vocals, and the
Fleet Foxes by lilting but muscular
melodies, particularly found in “Stran-
ger”. Richard could beneﬁt from more
musical experimentation and varia-
tion both within and between songs.
However, with his thirst for musical
inspiration and continued gigging to
audiences in Cambridge, Brighton and
London, he is sure to push
these boundaries and to
inspire his audience. I
strongly recommend a
YouTube or SoundCloud
search for the songs re-
leased so far and there will
be an EP to listen to in the
spring. He is playing at St
Pancras Old Church on
the 4th of April.
Richard Allen II
Singer-songwriter
Sivu Progressive Pop
Courtesy of St Barts Hospital, Sivu re-
cently spent two hours in an MRI scan-
ner recording the video for his ﬁrst sin-
gle “Better Man han He”
. Fascination
with both the song and the movement
of his tongue as he sings has caused
Youtube views to
rocket. And the Sivu
storm has continued
to rage following the
release of the sin-
gle. It was recorded
with Alt-J producer,
Charlie Andrews,
and similarities to
the hit band are au-
dible, particularly
in the layering and
the vocal percus-
sion in the track.
he orchestration
in Sivu’s music, now
involving various
combinations of
voice, cello, violin,
keys, drums, harp
and omnichord, creates an ambience
that lingers long after ﬁnal notes. In-
genious use of instruments gives each
its own stage. Reiterated treble phrases
are placed perfectly over rolling
waves of reverberating chords,
reminiscent of Wild Beasts, and
the melodies are ear-worms that
stay with you for days. he sound
is strangely comforting and
dreamy, no matter what you were
doing before listening. James
Page, the mastermind behind
the venture, writes bittersweet
Apples & Eve
Alternative Folk
here is a beautiful primordial feel to
Apples & Eve’s music, accentuated by
gig artwork presenting naked drawings
of the ﬁrst woman in the Bible. One can
draw parallels between the femi-
nist power of the biblical ﬁgure
and Eva Howells, the lead singer
and sole songwriter in the band.
Her striking poise and deep, rich
and passionate voice engulfs the
listener and keeps you listening
for hours. She plays the guitar
and the accordion and has ac-
quired a drummer, a violinist, a
bassist(whohasalsoworkedwith
the likes of Laura Marling, and
James Morrison) and another
guitarist along the way, as well as
many avid supporters. Eva leads
the band, headstrong, though
mysterious songs telling of Greek
mythology and sea creatures. he tex-
ture of the music is like that of treacle
and the seductive, lilting rhythms are
somewhat reminiscent of walking on a
large ship or after one too many glasses
of wine. Despite the primitive feel, the
songs are musically complex, with lyri-
cal violin solos cutting through the
rippling blanket of harmonies and
many almost a cappella moments
with which Eva lullabies us into con-
templation. Inﬂuences have been
plucked from many an apple tree
across blues, gypsy and even reg-
gae. An EP and a single have been
released and are well worth a listen.
he EP was hand printed using a
wood cut on recycled wallets.
The Intermission Project
Funk/Soul
Currently London’s favour-
ite band of 18-year-olds,
he Intermission Project
was formed when two
school friends embarked on
a gap year of music-
making whilst they
decide what road
to take in life. Six
months in, they’ve
paved this road al-
ready. On the way
they have adopted
Sam, an alternat-
ing saxophonist/
cellist whose smile
they spotted at a
gig, and the result-
ing composition of
the band is delight-
ful. Jim Rubaduka,
the lead singer, has
an eﬀortlessly rich and
characterful voice, perfectly
tuned over every twist and
lyrics, often both
empowering and
regretful, and his
distinctive voice is
perfectly suited to
these. He touches
on religion, hu-
man nature and
mental wellbeing,
but they are mere-
ly suggested and
so his songs are
neither depressing
nor pretentious.
His voice is well-
enunciated and
sticks on certain
words, but ﬂoats
ethereally over
others. Sivu’s mu-
sic can be found
on SoundCloud or
Youtube, “Better
Man han He” can
be purchased on
Itunes or Spotify,
and there will be
an EP out later this
year. Deﬁnitely
one to watch.
turn. Alex Watson tracks
the melody with tight vocal
harmonies & reinforces the
bright sound on the banjo
and mandolin. he sound
is relatively simple but
the melodies ingeniously
memorable. Despite their
young age and the band’s
infancy, emotions in their
songs successfully span joy,
regret and hope, bringing
a charming youthfulness
but also a remark-
able maturity wher-
ever appropriate.
And the band blends
genres – the layered
string instruments
and vocal harmonies
suggest folk whilst
the ﬂuid saxophone
solos and warmth
in Jim’s voice brings
a welcome dose of
soul. he Intermis-
sion Project have mu-
sic on YouTube and
SoundCloud and are
recording an EP at
the moment. heir grinning
enthusiasm is a joy to watch.
