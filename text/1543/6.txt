n 3 March at
23:59 nomina-
tions for this
year’s Big Elec-
tions closed.
hese are the elections for a
large number of positions at
Imperial College Union. All of
the Sabbatical positions will be
elected by the student body of
Imperial, with the Union hop-
ing to beat last year’s record
turnout. All of the manifes-
tos for the candidates can be
found from page 13 onwards,
or online at imperialcollege-
union.org/elections. Impe-
rial students must then submit
votes ranking their preference
for each candidate with a sin-
gle transferrable vote system.
here is also the option to vote
for RON, which stands for Re-
Open Nominations. If RON
wins the election is re-run.
Candidates had to submit
their 250 word manifestos on-
line. By the time of publication,
they will have been campaign-
ing for nearly a whole working
week, with voting opening on
Friday 8 March at 12:00. On
hursday 7 March, the can-
didates took part in hustings.
his was in the form of a live
STOIC broadcast called “Meet
the Candidates”, which is now
available on the Union’s Elec-
tions website. his did have
some technical diﬃculties at
the start, and had some is-
sues with lagging all the way
throughout. Voting will close
on 15 March at 12:00, with
the results being announced
in Metric that night for the
Results Party. Allowing can-
didates to celebrate or drown
sorrows. his means that next
week will be when campaign-
ing is, in all likelihood, taken
up a notch. hroughout the
election process, the Union
will be blogging the election.
his involves updating with
photos and tweets of candi-
dates.
he Union has revamped the
look of the promotional mate-
rial and has the live stats web-
site up once more. his will be
showing voting stats from the
moment voting opens.
his year has seen some
changes in the rules. To stand
for a position, regardless of
the position, there was only
one seconder required. he
Big Elections website how-
ever made some believe that
20 seconders were needed
for the Sabbatical positions.
his was due to the code that
showed the capping not being
changed. Another change was
that the Returning Oﬃcer for
the Elections is an external,
which is standard practice at
most other unions. Although
the Deputy Returning Oﬃcers
are staﬀ members at the Un-
ion. hey have said that they
are interested in the demo-
cratic legitimacy of the Union.
Candidates no longer have to
submit their campaign materi-
al to the Returning Oﬃcer for
approval. Instead it is a system
whereby people put out there
material and can then get into
trouble for it at a later time.
he complaints procedure
has also been changed from
last year. his year, only com-
plaints submitted via an on-
line form can be upheld. his
form requires complainants to
ﬁnd the relevant code for their
complaint.
In the Initial Candidates
Meeting, the Returning Of-
ﬁcer, reminded everyone of
the importance of good cam-
paigning. He said: “his is an
election not a selection”.
As with every year, this year
the election has already had
something in the way of con-
troversy. here is one candi-
date, Forhad Matin, who is
standing for every single posi-
tion available to him, although
he has only submitted a mani-
festo for Union President,
RCSU President and Chemsoc
President, and he has not sub-
mitted a photo for any role.
One candidate for Union
President, Christopher Kaye,
had a complaint lodged against
him because of the poster he
used. he complaint was re-
garding the language used. he
poster said his main manifesto
points of selling cigarettes at
the Union and putting a photo
of the Queen behind the bar in
smaller writing with “Fags at
the Union”, “Queen at the Un-
ion”, and “Not a prat” in larger
writing (see below). he mes-
sage from the Returning Oﬃc-
ers, which was a formal warn-
ing, stated: “Your poster…
contains oﬀensive language
(“fags”, “prat” and, in this con-
text, “queen”). he candidates’
pack and publicity policy
clearly state that “all campaign
material must not contain of-
fensive language, contain im-
plied oﬀensive language, or be
libelous in nature”.” It then said:
“Please remove any physical
and online publicity with this
language immediately.” Chris
Kaye rejected the complaint
saying: “he language used is
not oﬀensive in context.” He
said that “fag” was referencing
cigarettes and that “Queen”
referenced the Queen, saying
“I am Chair of History Soci-
ety and, in my opinion, the
involvement of the Monarchy
in the College’s history is very
important. If I cannot refer
to the ‘Queen’ then my ability
to express myself is severely
restricted”. He said that the
word prat is “informal and not
oﬀensive according to [the]
Cambridge Dictionary” He
says he modiﬁed his posters,
and that the Returning Oﬃc-
ers never replied to him. He
has since withdrawn from the
election, giving his primary
reason as the amount of work
he has to do. He added: “I’m
just dispondant with the whole
thing, and don’t want things
to turn as nasty as things did
with Abdul last year.” When
asked about the posters he
said: “It might’ve been better
had I been given the beneﬁt
of the doubt and allowed to
keep my poster as it was, and
let democracy run its course.”
here were allegations that
Kaye’s posters were being torn
down, with a report from one
of Felix’s Comment Editors
that he saw someone rip down
a poster, and that two posters
disappeared within minutes
of him walking past the same
spot. Kaye later satirized the
whole campaigning process
with a Facebook group “Chris
Kaye for ﬁnishing his compu-
tational labs”.
For President, there are
now three candidates left
with manifestos and pictures,
and one with a manifesto
only. he other candidates
did not submit a picture or
manifesto.
here was also a glitch in
the system of the online
manifestos. One
candidate for
D e p u t y
P r e s i -
d e n t
(Clubs & Societies) had a man-
ifesto that was over 400 words
long. his problem was ﬁxed
the next day.
As well as that, there have
been the usual people posting
in pre-existing groups. Plus
several candidates wanted to
edit manifestos as well as one
candidate wanting to have
their manifesto put up, as they
missed the deadline. It was
ruled that everyone had the
same restrictions and that no-
body can edit or put up mani-
festos now.
he position of Deputy Pres-
ident (Education) has only two
candidates facing oﬀ against
RON, with one not submit-
ting a photo or manifesto.
he same goes for Deputy
President (Finance &
Services), with one
candidate with-
drawing.
With eve-
rything set in
place, the elec-
tions are now
well and truly
underway.
