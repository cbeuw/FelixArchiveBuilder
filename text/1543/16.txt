PRESIDENT
No manifesto submitted.
Noor El-Ansari
As RAG chair I gave you the RAG you
wanted. We turned around a defunct
society, tripled the amount raised
last year in less than two terms, and
erected a bungee-jump on the Queen’s
lawn. Now to give you the university
you want. Undergrads bring in 1/3 of
College income. Masters students pay
astronomical fees. PhD students do
all the work. We are this university, so
why doesn’t it feel ours?
1. To make your College yours I will:
• Push for exam feedback from per-
sonal tutors in more departments.
• Support international students by
pushing College to fund community-
building projects as done at MIT.
• Demand a new mechanism to en-
sure student consultation from the
outset of College decision-making.
We can never allow another North
Acton.
2. To make your Union yours I will:
• Introduce a sabbatical oﬃcer hot-
desk in the JCR Friday lunchtimes
where we will listen to your views.
• Run Union bars/clubs the way you
want them with a new student-led En-
tertainments committee.
• Provide a sponsorship speed-dat-
ing service for clubs and socs.
3. To make your time yours I will:
• Lobby the Health Centre to see pa-
tients one more evening per week.
• Endeavor for direct postgraduate
input into the replacement of the Hol-
land Club.
• Campaign for an annual half-day
free to allow all undergraduates to en-
gage in volunteering or charity fund-
raising as medics already do.
Visit votedavid.co.uk where I ex-
plain the need for and implementation
of these policies amongst others.

Who am I?
Ali Ibrahim, studying Biomedical
Sciences. This year I hold two posi-
tions on the RCSU executive commit-
tee and have worked in the union for
almost 3 years.
I’m a member of the Lacrosse Club
and had a brief stint as a cheerleader.
As president, I will do everything
I possibly can and more to represent
each and every one of you, and make
your student experience as amazing as
it possibly can be.
I will respond to all issues as and
when they arise and make sure the ul-
timate outcome has the student’s pri-
orities at its core.
I will:
• Continue the push #AgainstActon
• Push for all courses to video every
lecture to be available in an online ar-
chive
• Improve Imperial’s rankings - tar-
geting student satisfaction and the
NSS survey
• Completely abolish union entry
fees –no one should have to pay to get
into their own union
• Transparency within the union –
students should know what’s happen-
ing as it happens, not once its already
been decided, eg. through Sabbatical
video blogs on a fortnightly basis
• Monthly “surgery” on Queen’s
Lawn, where students can approach
sabbaticals with any queries/sugges-
tions
• Fresher’s Fair 2.0 (in second term)
Ultimately, the student union presi-
dent’s role is to represent every single
student. So in addition to the points I
propose here, let me emphasize that
together, WE will make a diﬀerence!
After all, it is we students that make
Imperial one of the greatest universi-
ties in the world.

Ali Ibrahim
This is the uncensored version of my
manifesto, since the man keeps put-
ting me down. Hopefully this won’t
also be censored like my posters were.
Hello! I’m Chris Kaye, a 3rd year
chemist, and I’m running for ICU
President.
I ﬁnd the anti-alcohol Policy that the
Union adopted in 2012 unnecessary
and patronising. Bar staﬀ do not need
to be told how to collect glasses ‘safely’,
and we do not need to be told how to
drink. Simply exempting ‘yards’ from
this nonsense is not good enough!
Secondly, I think the Union bars
should sell cigarettes. The Union
Newsagents currently does, but it
closes at 6pm, which is very inconven-
ient for smoking customers at the bar.
This is about freedom of choice.
Thirdly, I think there should be a
portrait of the Queen at the Union
bars and Dining Hall. She gave Impe-
rial College its Royal Charter in 2007
when she visited the College.
Finally, I would investigate with TFL
and Estates about the possibility of
installing an Oyster Card top-up ma-
chine somewhere in College. If it’s late
and the Tube is closed, you want to
know you are able to get home.
TL;DR :
-Abolish anti-alcohol policy
-Tobacco products at Union bars
-Portrait of the Queen at Union
-Investigate having an Oyster top-
up machine
