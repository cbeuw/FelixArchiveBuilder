his season has been one of highs
and lows with a strong team form-
ing from an almost completely new
squad. By Christmas the team was on
a roll leaving everyone excited for the
rest of the season and the prospect
of beating the medics come Varsity.
Injuries, shoulder operations, illness
and coursework however have had
other ideas which led to losing some
easy matches at the start of the 2nd
term, but IC 1’s are now on the up.
Sophie Andrew and Verity Roberts,
both new to the 1st team this year,
are deﬁnitely ones to watch in the de-
fending D and with the return of our
wounded soldier, Kirsty Roy, every-
one is hungry for the win, none more
so than Sam Killick and Tamar Loach
for whom this will be their last var-
sity. We will certainly give the med-
ics a run for their money this year
and hopefully come away with a win.
LET’S GO IC!
ICSM 1s have had a fantastic season,
diversity, coupled with consistency has
secured us places in the LUSL cup ﬁnal
and the BUCS cup semi ﬁnal. he com-
mitment of the entire squad has really
shone through in our games, having only
lost 3 matches the entire season. Losing a
few key players last year, this season was
metwithsomeanticipation,however,the
team gelled quickly resulting in a great
dynamic.
Without being too cocky, the expecta-
tions for Varsity are pretty much a solid
win. If you’re looking for some interest-
ing moves, keep your eye on Emma Wil-
liamson for her unreal interceptions.
Lindsay Hennah and Binta Umar will be
swatting away IC’s goals in defence so
Harriet McGrath, Hannah Scanlon and
Louise hornhill can work the ball down
the court to our high precision shoot-
ers (Beth Nally, Sophie Ellis and Frances
Dixon). Watch out IC, this team is on a
winning streak!

As the winners of last year’s varsity
the 2s are more determined than ever
to beat the medics! We have been
very successful in both the LUSL and
BUCS leagues, maintaining a position
in the top half of the table for both
and are close to promotion in BUCS.
Losing one of our key players, Toni
Semmence, to injury midway through
the season, was a shock but the team
rallied to ﬁll in her position and con-
tinues to play great netball. Our stand
out player this season has been Har-
riet Rumgay who was bought from the
4s at the start of the year but has ﬁtted
into the team seamlessly.
From a disappointing season last year,
culminating in our loss at Varsity,
the ICSM 2nd team has gone from
strength to strength this year. Our
performance in the LUSL league has
really demonstrated our skill and ver-
satility on the court; we have beaten
both IC 2s and IC 3s and are currently
pondering the prospect of promotion.
he nerves for Varsity have already
kicked in. he psychological train-
ing has started, the ﬁtness sessions
have commenced and we are ready
to do something which the Medics
Netball Club has managed to do for
as long as I can remember: beat IC.
he sheer accuracy of our shooters
should be enough to make Imperial
quake in their trainers, let alone the
sprightliness of our centre court play-
ers and the lightning fast hands of our
defence. he ICSM 2nd team are in
a better position than this time last
year; we are ready for you IC.
Players to watch: Emily Boyce (C) will
scream at the top of her voice for that
ball – and always get it, and Hiba Sal-
eem Danish (GK) has arms that come
out of nowhere and will do anything to
stop you scoring.
he 3s have had a season of ups and
downs, currently 3rd in both league
tables there is deﬁnitely potential for
us to move up a few spaces in the com-
ing weeks. Two years ago the Varsity
match was won by 1 goal, last year it
was lost by 2, and this year we hope
to come away with a win! he third
team lost many of its senior players
last year, so this season we have been
building new relationships and getting
to know a whole new team – players
to look out for are fresher shooter Iso-
bel and our senior Centre, Amelia.
This season had a slow start for the
3s however they picked up their
game through some hard training
and this year got further in LUSL
cup than ever before! Expectations
are high for Varsity- as ever in Net-
ball- so expect a highly-strung close
match between both 3s teams. Play-
ers to watch- our new freshers that
joined 3rd team with some great de-
fensive skills. Watch out IC!
This season has been quite a good
one for the 4th team, which is play-
ing in LUSL. Of course, we had ups
and downs, as some players got in-
jured. We all managed to improve
our skills, from girls that were new
to the sport to returning netballers:
one of us even got promoted to the
2s. Talking of promotion, depend-
ing on the outcome of our next
match against LSE, we might get
promoted in the league!
We will definitively put on a fight at
Varsity and give our best against the
medics.
After earning promotion to the BUCS
South Eastern 8A League, it has been
a challenging season for ICSM 4s. We
have welcomed lots of new players into
the team who have all made valuable
contributions over the season. Despite a
diﬃcult start, the 4s have really come to-
gether as a team giving us some encour-
aging results. Shooters Rosa and Chan-
dni have gone from strength to strength
thisseasonandarenowaformidablepair
in the attacking third. Nat Ilenkovan has
been invaluable in defence and a great
supporting player in centre court. Hav-
ing recently beaten Imperial College 3s,
ICSM 4s are going into the Varsity match
knowing that it will be tough but we are
capable of victory if we give 110%!
he 5th team previously being a social
team has grown this season by being en-
tered into the LUSL league. We started oﬀ
the year with a new team who had never
played together before and some who had
never played netball. We have improved as
a team and with varsity fast approaching
ouraimissimplytoplayourbestandwin.
Its been a good season for ICSM
5s, who maintain a good position in
both of the LUSL and BUCS league
swell as having a great intake of
freshers. Expecting a strong win
over IC 5s having already playing
them once this season and winning
29-3 as well as beating IC by 30 goals
last year.
