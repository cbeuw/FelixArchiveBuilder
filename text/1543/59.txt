Hashi
Connect all the is-
lands with bridges
so that you can get
from any island to any
other one. There are
restrictions, though:
the bridges have to be
either vertical or hori-
zonal and they must
not intersect. You can
have up to two bridg-
es between any two
islands and, last but
not least, each island
must have exactly as
many bridges stem-
ming from it as the
number on it.
