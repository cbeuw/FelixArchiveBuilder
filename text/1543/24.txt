STUDENT TRUSTEE
Being part of the highest board in the
Union, student trustees have a say in
inﬂuencing the most important deci-
sions made by the Union.
As a 2nd year biomed, I’m part of
both the ICU and ICSMSU. I feel that
there’s a great divide between the two
Unions such that students that are
part of either ICU/ICSMSU often feel
excluded from the other. I am deeply
involved with biologists and medics
both academically and socially, and
therefore I believe that I’m the perfect
person to help bridge this gap, and
make sure that ALL your voices are
heard, regardless of whether you’re a
medic/non-medic.
Moreover, I feel that not enough
students know what matters they’re
allowed to have a say in or have a rec-
ognisable medium through which to
voice their concerns. his needs to
change, as YOU, the students are the
most important people.
I therefore want to IMPROVE
COMMUNICATIONS between the
Union and students and this can be
achieved through the better use of so-
cial media (via Facebook, Twitter) to
inform YOU, the students, about the
changes taking place at Imperial and
how YOU can aﬀect these outcomes
by voicing YOUR opinions to us.
Decisions made by the trustee board
will inevitably and directly aﬀect YOU.
With YOUR vote, I will ensure that the
decisions made and that the appeals
lodged by the board represent YOUR
views and improve YOUR student life
and satisfaction at Imperial.
So trust me as your Trustee and vote

he Union Trustee Board possesses
multiple functions: it supervises the
Union’s long-term strategy, it ap-
proves legal and ﬁnancial decisions
and it is the last step in the appeals
process.
As a member of Union Council and
the Executive Committee, I know the
ﬁrst and second roles of the trustee
board well and am conﬁdent with the
last having also sat on the Union Elec-
tions Committee.
Having held Society and Year Rep
positions, I have signiﬁcant experi-
ence in setting all decisions in a wider
context and will always keep the well-
being of students as a top priority.
With my past experience as a foun-
dation, I am ﬁrm in my belief that I
can provide a representative, informa-
tive and strategic voice whilst entrust-
ed with the Student Trustee position.
he governing body of the union
needs someone fearless and unafraid
to voice their opinion and challenge
ideas, and this is a trait that I have a
proven track record of displaying both
in Council and Exec.
his is something that YOU, the Un-
ion’s members deserve and is some-
thing I promise to promote if elected.
he union has been undergoing
drastic changes over the past few
years and this is likely to continue for
a few more yet, particularly as we ease
into our charity status. his period of
time calls for trustees with the breadth
of experience to know how the union
runs and what is feasible, which is
what you would be getting with a Vote

Imperial College London is great for
many reasons and one of its greatest
strengths is of course, its students.
Its students come from far and wide,
and each come with their own unique
blend of talents. Individuals of your
calibre deserve to be provided with
the very best, empowering you to fulﬁl
your tremendous potential. he Im-
perial College Union is here to serve
each and every student. It is here to
enhance your education and facilitate
your development.
As a 1st year student I have had
the privilege of immediately experi-
encing the beneﬁts brought about by
many years of hard work carried out
by the Union. From Welcome Week to
course administration to Clubs, Socie-
ties and Projects, the Union has made
a positive impact in every aspect of my
time at Imperial so far. I am extremely
grateful to the Union and I want to
contribute to the work of the Union.
I have not been bound by bounda-
ries at this very institution and thus I
believe, as do you, that we can achieve
whatever we envisage. We all want the
very best for ourselves, our friends
and our institution. Allow me to re-
alise your visions for the Union and
ensure that the Union serves our best
interests.
Vote Shiqu! Vote your vision!

Being a student trustee means having
no hidden agenda and ensuring that
the union are heading in the right di-
rection. he trustee board attends the
union meetings and looks over the ob-
jectives, aims and ﬁnancial activity of
the union.
I am an approachable and friendly
person with experience in many dif-
ferent types of societies such as Save
he Children, Hindu Society and will
be organising TEDMED this year! As
a third year mechanical engineer I’ve
also had the opportunity to attend
events from a plethora of diﬀerent
societies. I feel these experiences will
allow me to serve as a student trustee
well. I have gained a great outlook on
the diversity of the student body and
the eﬀect of the union on societies and
university as a whole.
Coming from a multicultural back-
ground, I feel that I am extremely
capable of accommodating to the di-
versity that is Imperial. I believe I will
represent the views of the student
body appropriately on the board and
make for a great candidate.
Hopefully this Bullet-Pruth mani-
festo will have convinced you to vote
me for student trustee!
