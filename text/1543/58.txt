This week you’re grazing in a
club. But you’re pretty drunk,
and get carried away. Next
thing you know you’re chok-
ing on a pube hairball - you’ve
mistaken gorgeous curls for
an unpruned lady garden, and
she won’t let you stop til she’s
suffocated you with minge pie
and sweaty lady gravy, min-
gled with your own vomit.
This week you genetically en-
gineer your crabs so they glow
in the dark. You entice a guy
back to yours, but his boner
shrinks faster than the speed
of sound when he sees your
fluorescent minge, creating a
sonic boom that sprays your
glowing pets on the ceiling.
It’s like lying under the stars to-
gether, but a lot less romantic.
This week you have a flaky
vagina, and the dead skin is
peeling off like you’ve been
nude sunbathing for a week in
40 degree heat. It’s flaking so
bad that it feels like your whole
labia is sloughing off, and
you’re trailing dead skin like
you’re scattering the ashes of
Henry VIII. Time to buy some
moisturiser.
This week you are furtively pick-
ing your nose but haven’t cut
your fingernails in months. You
hook your pinky talon round a
particularly meaty bogey and
begin the evacuation. But then
you realise it’s actually your
brain: the last thing you see be-
fore you lose consciousness is
coils of your cerebrum congeal-
ing on a pile on the floor.
This week the festering
baked bean can by your
sink grows so much bacteria
that it comes to life. It starts
its new sadistic existence by
flaying you alive with the jag-
ged edge of its lid to replen-
ish its contents: your diced
up organs become the new
beans; your blood the toma-
toey sauce.
This week you are extracting
an ingrown hair from your bi-
kini line when it comes alive
and grows to a metre long. It
dives back into your skin then
emerges again, and begins
sewing up your labia until all
that’s left is a conspicuous
black line of running-stitch all
the way up to your anus.
This week you are a blue
morphsuit. Some evil account-
ancy firm think it would be
funny to put you on a sweaty
man as he and 4 of his mates
dance around with some very
loose connection to career op-
portunities. He isn’t wearing
any clothes underneath and
you end up rubbing against his
pubic hair on you.
This week, you have finished
exams for the year, effectively
giving you a summer with no
exams, instead you ‘do your
dissertation’, a 6000 word lab
report for 10 weeks based on
counting birds or something
(not including your 5 week eas-
ter holiday) that you can leave
until the last day before bashing
out in an epic all-nighter. Twat
This week, after finishing ex-
ams for the year and going to
a ‘drinks with lecturers’ event
(see: free booze), you decide
that the best course of action
would be to show your head of
department a video of you do-
ing embarrassing things with
a sex-toy. Noone else does.
Worst of all, you get weirdly
turned on while watching it.
This week you are so sleep
deprived from 2 months of
impossible deadlines and all
nighters that you fall asleep in
the JCR. The pie shop has run
out of beef for their pies, but
keen not to be caught out in
the horsemeat scandal, they
chop you up instead and en-
case chunks of your flesh in
pastry. Pint?
This week you are in the library
when your genital cravings
overwhelm you, so you turn to
your pencil case in despera-
tion. You cram highlighters up
your vag like you’re trying to
dam the Thames, but the pres-
sure of the river of lust causes
them to shoot out at high
speed at the bookshelf, and
they rebound up your nostrils.
This week you must choose be-
tween queefing every time you
speak and having a constant
trickle of diarrhoea out of your bel-
ly button. You could pretend to be
mute to avoid queefing, but learn-
ing sign language would be tedi-
ous. Alternatively, the diarrhoea
wouldbelessimmediatelyrestric-
tive but the smell would always
prevail.What’sitgoingtobe?
