perfect, manifesto confirms

A
candidate in the elec-
tions, Jamie Lussey,
has conﬁrmed that his
election will make “eve-
rything much better”.
He went on to state that “everything
will be transparent in the Union”,
referring to his plan to make the en-
tire building glass lined. He also said
there will be “greater student involve-
ment in stuﬀ or something”. When
questioned on this point he retorted
that he “hadn’t had time to think of
the details” as he “was attempting to
re-write his CV in preparation for his
guaranteed election”. At this point
the interview was cut short as he had
to get into his fancy dress costume
and buy sweets to throw at people.
he Turnip asked some students in
the JCR what they thought of the can-
didate after he talked to them. hey
said: “Well, he said some boring shit
about democracy, and, to be
frank, almost lost my vote.
But then, bam, he gave me
some really nice sweets and
said ‘don’t be fussy, vote for
Lussey’. I mean, that’s classic
BANTER. I bet it took him,
like, 5 minutes to think of
that”.
Mr Lussey also conﬁrmed
that he would be removing en-
trance charges from the Union,
but with the stipulation that
they keep charging at the en-
trance of the Union. He also
conﬁrmed that his ﬂagship
policy of “professionalism”
was indeed “just buzzwords”
as “let’s face it, nobody gives a
shit what they say, they usually
just vote based on the picture
or what their friend tells them
to do”.
Rap Lyric of
the Week
“Walk up to the club like, “What up,
I got a big cock””
Presumably the bouncer will then
say “yeah, cheers mate, get your
ID out and go to the back of the
line”. Plus “big” doesn’t give us a
detailed analysis. For all we know,
you could be rocking a chode. Plus,
that’s a generally crass and dickish
(pun intended) way of introducing
yourself to everyone.

loser. Anyway... Send stuff in:
