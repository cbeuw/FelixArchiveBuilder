Sir,
I am intrigued to hear that there is po-
tentially an intrinsic bias in the supervi-
sion and running of the Union elections.
he event that particularly raised this to
my attention was when one of the candi-
dates was ordered to change the content
of their poster. I shall not comment on
whether that content was oﬀensive or
not, though, it was concerning to hear
that the returning oﬃcers in fact hold
positions in the welfare department.
It is not surprising that people who
work for the Union informally support
one candidate, though I feel it is unde-
sirable to have the people who work for,
if that is the correct relation, a candidate
to be in the role of ensuring that an elec-
tion is run fairly. It is also a worrying
sign that it is not widely published who
the returning oﬃcers are, unless I am
unable to properly navigate the union
website.
It is, as far as I know, a rare situation
for a incumbent sabbatical to run for
election again, but when it happens is
perfectly understandable why people
closely linked to the union would sup-
port them due to their vast experience.
With this considered, more checks and
balances must be bought in to prevent
this preference having a major inﬂuence
on the election result.

Sir,
I would like the College to address the
serious lack of napping space around
campus.
I am a frequent snoozer, and I ﬁnd
that during times of tiredness, getting
a good nap is imperative to being able
to concentrate eﬀectively on my work.
In this regard, College’s abject failure
to provide napping space has been seri-
ously detrimental to my academic de-
velopment.
Often my only options for get-
ting some much-needed shuteye are
sprawled over the uncomfortable fold-
ing chairs in empty lecture theaters, or
on the sofa of a highly-public common
room (to the chagrin of all other users of
the space). Clearly this is not beneﬁcial
to anyone.
What I would thus like to suggest is
the establishment of an Imperial Col-
lege Napping Society: give them a small
room and some camp beds, and solve
the napping crisis once and for all!

ow, I have a huge con-
fession to make. Well,
it’s something that I
can’t really help, aside
from the non-stop
verbal diarrhea. When it began is as
misty as a fading memory skipping
on old stones in a running brook, but
it must have been somewhere in my
childhood.
It became my friend, almost always
helping me to learn and resulting
in those deep meaningful conversa-
tions which end up changing your
life somewhat. It has a name, perhaps
familiar to many yet surrounded in a
haze of enigma, unless you’ve been
brave enough to reach out to it and go
together on a journey.
It has a name, which is ‘why’. In the
beginning, it started oﬀ with: “Why
are the leaves swaying?” “Why is the
weather changing?” hen progressed
onto the generic “Why can’t I do this?
I’m old enough, thank you.” “Why
study science when I love art?” “Why
can’t everyone hold hands and be hap-
py?” To the rather mature: “Why does
the world not make any sense?” Quite
rightly too, it doesn’t.
Anyway, there is a spectrum of in-
quisitiveness; from personal curiosity
related to the self and sense of devel-
opment, to asking questions about
how the world works to ﬁnding an-
swers that make a positive impact on
Earth.
It is this spectrum of curiosity that
keeps me busy on many explorations.
If I didn’t understand anything, an al-
most expedition-like tendency took
over. To understand the schizophren-
ic nature of my primary caregiver, ul-
timately led to trekking up mountains,
meditating and ﬁnding every source
of fresh holy water – and an increas-
ingly humbled holier-than-thou an-

noying attitude. Being passionately
curious about the environment, a
favourite hobby leading to explor-
ing the wilderness and collecting leaf
samples, which would then be neatly
pressed into handmade cards.
Being a seeker of spirituality, read-
ing about various faiths was never
enough; painting about them was not
either. I had to visit the holy houses
and temples, and irritate many nuns,
imams, rabbis, priests and fakirs with
my endless questions. I had to visit
sacred sites and temples many thou-

osity of the scared.
Yet, despite all these inquisitive ad-
ventures, I still am very much curious
about a lot of things. In particularly,
I suppose currently about the hormo-
nal nature of the female species, you
never know when the tornado is com-
ing. So I duck, just in case.
So, why am I telling you all this? Is
to reawaken your innately inquisitive
inner child? What’s it to you anyway?
Well, in the name of relevancy, a lot
actually. Why have you lost that insa-
tiably curious trait you were born with,
huh? Why have you stopped watching
karate kid and being inspired? Why
don’t you think for yourself?
Why don’t you question zeitgeist
and society, and empower Earth? Why
didn’t you use your own mind when
it could’ve mattered? Why don’t you
chain yourself to trees in Brazil to save
the rainforest? Why don’t you have
any questions, anymore? Why are you
being patronized by me?
Why am I making these assump-
tions? Well, I don’t know, perhaps it’s
a projection or maybe I need to ques-
tion some more. Why don’t you begin
your curiosity quest?
Let’s find out if
it’s venomous!
