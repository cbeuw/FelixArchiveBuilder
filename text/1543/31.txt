After a high fresher intake into the ﬁrst
team, there were a lot of new faces and
competition for positions was high.
Despite having very skillful players,
the season started slowly with a few
disappointing losses - the diﬃculty of
so many new players changing posi-
tions and teams becoming apparent.
However, after the team settled down,
and with some match experience and
valuable training sessions under our
belts, the wins started to come. he
second half of the season has seen us
almost undefeated, making the semiﬁ-
nals of both the BUCS and LUSL cups
with some very impressive victories,
and high hopes of beating the medics
(pre-Varsity!) in the LUSL cup to reach
the ﬁnal! Varsity will, as always, be a
ﬁerce and competitive game; but with
the team now on top form and playing
some fantastic hockey, we are all geared
up for the pinnacle of the season and I
have no doubt we will win Varsity this
year - a testament to the great players
we have here, and their hard work and
commitment to the team.

he season began with a new look
squad and after a string of a few com-
fortable wins we stumbled before the
Xmas break drawing a couple of cru-
cial games. We’re still in the hunt for
promotion in the BUCS league and
ﬁnd ourselves in the LUSL Cup Semi-
ﬁnal against IC, which will undoubt-
edly be a feisty ‘warm up’. After Varsity
we will defend our title in the United
Hospitals tournament. Although we
have several Freshers making their
Varsity debut, they are as eager as
anyone to get stuck into IC and I can’t
wait to unleash them! I ﬁrmly believe
we can go one better than the draw
last year and capture that elusive Var-
sity win. After all, our Club Captain
known far and wide as just ‘he Cher-
ub’ has promised to spend everything
in his bank account if we get the win!
So far this season, the Ladies 1’s have
relished the new challenges as a result
of promotion last year. Playing against
some tough opposition has meant we’ve
had to really step up; a task that we have
been more than capable of.
We have been anticipating this year’s
Varsity immensely, particularly after
having previously drawn with the med-
ics already this season. Having won
some tough games in the build-up to
Varsity, the team are ready to take the
medics on with a vengeance, in what
could be a close battle between the two
teams.

A dynamic forward line, a hard-work-
ing midﬁeld and a strong defence… it
has all come together this season! We
have faced tough opposition in our
new LUSL league (including IC) and
have surpassed all expectations. In
BUCS we are heading for promotion
with a goal diﬀerence that shadows all
the competition. A great selection of
new players, teamed with our already
strong core has led to our goal-scor-
ing abilities sky-rocketing (both on
and oﬀ the pitch!!). We are deﬁnitely
hoping to sneak a few whoppers past
the IC defence! As the under-dogs
we matched IC with a 1-1 draw ear-
lier in the season, at Varsity we have
everything to play for and nothing to
lose!! his is going to be our year, we’re
planning on ﬁnally turning the tables.
It’s a game to watch!
Players to watch: Alison Kent, in her
ﬁnal year at med school and ﬁnal var-
sity! She’s never missed a match and
her pace up-front is enough to give
any defender SOB.
Forward team-mate Claudia Fowler-
Williams, new to the squad this year
and tearing up the front line from day
one is another one to keep your eye
on!

Imperial Ladies 2s have had an encour-
aging season so far. We started oﬀ with
a very new team that has taken some
time to gel. We have won the major-
ity of our matches and had some real
highlights such as winning 9-0 against
a strong City team, who previously beat
us 4-0 at the start of the season. he
team spirit and winning mentality has
put us in a strong position to challenge
for the top position in our BUCS league.

and victory in varsity. Varsity won’t be
easy, having already faced an intense
draw against the medics before Christ-
mas. We will be taking our famous La-
dies 2s picnics, port and cheese and will
be ready to take a win for Imperial and
to support the rest of Imperial College
towards another triumph in Varsity.
We’ve had a really great season so far
and are ready and excited for our var-
sity clash. he highlight of our season
was battling back from 2-0 down, in a
horrendous snow blizzard, to save the
match. Hopefully we will bring some
of that ﬁghting spirit to the pitch for
Varsity! Our 2 top goal scorers Margot
and Steph are currently tying on num-
ber of goals scored this season, so let’s
see who could propel us to the win and
top the goal tally at the end of the sea-
son. Other players to watch are Kylie
who will be playing in her last varsity
after being in the club for 8 years, and
our freshers Fiona and Krishna who
have been invaluable in defence for us
this season. We’re going to come out
ﬁghting, determined to triumph over
IC this year!

he Men’s 2s Season has been ﬁlled
with some truly great performances.
On our day we have beaten teams 3
leagues above our own, and only tough
luck combined with a slight lack of con-
sistency have left us oﬀ the top spot of
the league. Coming into Varsity we are
on a strong winning run (having recent-
ly beaten the BUCS league leaders) and
with many of last year’s victorious team
members still in the squad we are con-
ﬁdent that we have the ability to come
away with the win.
Players to watch are: Ben Bell, striker
and top goalscorer for this Season; Ja-
cob Farrant, left midﬁeld and scorer of a
sublime goal in last years match; Jonny
Clowes, Goalkeeper supreme in his
4th Varsity; Freddie, Right Back with
a ﬁerce hit and Mickey Pettit power
house in the centre of the ﬁeld.
We have had a largely successful sea-
son so far, being upper mid table in
our LUSL and BUCS leagues. Our
major success, though, has been in
the LUSL Cup where we beat Impe-
rial College 3s in the Quarter Finals to
make it to a semi-ﬁnal against London
School of Economics. Players to look
out for include:
Joe Barker, a solid traditional defen-
sive midﬁeld player who loves putting
in a big tackle
Karl Elmqvist, a handy right midﬁeld-
er fresher who’s good on the ball going
forward and has impressed for the 2s
this season.
Mustafa Franka, a solid right back
who’s quick and dependable.

hroughout the season the team has
gone from strength to strength, devel-
oping unrivalled skill and ability both
on and oﬀ the pitch. Varsity is in no
doubt the biggest match the team will
face this season. Every training ses-
sion, every match, every bar night has
been leading to moment we face down
the medics and bring home a win. he
game will be ﬁerce with every man on
the pitch playing for the win. Every
team member will stand and face the
challenge and will use every ounce of
energy to ensure we are victorious on
the day. Captain Slow will be ﬁring
on all cylinders, Eager Beaver is eager
for the win and Fritzl has promised to
bring the zip ties for the post match
celebrations. All of these elements will
combine to ensure the match will not
be one to miss.
After a glorious promotion season
last year in the ULU reserve league
4 the mighty ICSM 3s were expect-
ing thoroughly exciting season, in-
stead LUSL just threw us in the same
league again with a diﬀerent name.
Good one LUSL....
Jokes on ULU though, we’ve still
got the cup and we’re never giving it
back.
here has been the good and the
bad so far this season. he good has
been some terriﬁc champagne hock-
ey played almost every week. he
bad includes my appalling case of the
captain’s curse in front of goal and
generally every time Yash opens his
mouth. Speciﬁc matches are hazy to
remember except that time when we
beat IC 4s 6-0.... even I scored. Bring
on Varsity.
