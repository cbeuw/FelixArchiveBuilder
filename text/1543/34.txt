SELECTED KEY CLASHES
With an entirely new team this sea-
son, the IC Men’s team has struggled
to bring a regularly strong eﬀort to
the court. A very competitive divi-
sion 2 in BUCS this year has set the
team at risk of a potential relegation
to division 3. he second half of the
season will be crucial for this young
team. Bringing a lot of heart to knock-
out competition matches, the team
has secured its spot in the semi-ﬁnals
of the BUCS Cup and aiming for a
second participation in a row in the
LUSL Cup ﬁnal. he team currently
ranks ﬁrst in LUSL Premier Division.
his year’s IC squad will bring
young players who have yet to discov-
er the intense rivalry of Varsity. Veter-
an centre Peter Measham will be play-
ing his last game at Ethos and plans to
stop the ICSM team with his defen-
sive intensity and leadership. We will
be on the lookout for a power dunk
from the big man. Point-guard Hugo
Gevret has been a constant threat for
the opposition this year, combining
quick dribbling, great court vision,
and his deadly (and often controver-
sial) eurostep on the oﬀensive end.
He has mentioned having the urge to
ﬁnally throw an alley-oop pass, and
Varsity might be the perfect setting
for such a play!
Basketball
William Valla
After making great strides last season,
ICSM basketball has improved even
further this year. Our cumulative record
thus far is 10 wins and 2 losses. We are
currently undefeated in LUSL, at 5-0,
and have more than doubled our win
total in BUCS from last season, at 5-2.
Notable wins include defeating the IC
2nds in LUSL, and demolishing LSE by
50 points. If our strong play continues,
we are poised for promotion in both
BUCS and LUSL, a ﬁrst in club history.
his would be a huge accomplishment
for us, as only two years ago we were
merely considered a “social club”
.
With our solid interior play and
sharp-shooting guards, we are looking
to set yet another milestone in March
– capturing the Varsity title from IC for
the ﬁrst time ever.

MENS BASKETBALL
With a somewhat low start to the
season, Imperial Women’s Basket-
ball found themselves at the bottom
of the BUCS league with three early
losses. However, with a new coach
and a boost to the morale, subsequent
victories mean that we are now 4/6 in
BUCS, 5/10 in LUSL and climbing. We
are conﬁdent that this trend will con-
tinue to see us through a resounding
victory in Varsity!
Sarah Khawaja
his season has deﬁnitely been a
tough one for the ICSM Girls Basket-
ball Team. We have lost a lot of our
dear older members this year. Many
of whom have been in the club since
1st year. heir wisdom and knowledge
have been invaluable to us and we tru-
ly appreciate that.
But our hopes are still high with an
inﬂux of great new talent to our team.
Many of whom have never played bas-
ketball before. And though we have
a lot of challenges ahead of us, it can
only get better. I couldn’t be more
proud of our awesome team, we have
this and I hope it continues well on
into the future!!
Let’s get’em BLADES!!

Lacrosse
My name is Lizzie Allen (Lizal), I
play attack and I am captaining the
IC lacrosse side this year. I am cur-
rently doing my masters in phys-
ics studying that little known yet
illustrious planet Saturn!
Unfortunately, the medics are a
solid side so I’ve had to think out-
side the box in order to come up
with some tactics to defend the
inevitable onslaught of goals. Tak-
ing inspiration from Saturn, we
are going to have 9 players stand-
ing around the goal, rotating in
rings, with the aim of deflecting
any shots.
Here are some little known facts
about Saturn:
· The planet primarily consists of
hydrogen, which becomes a non-
ideal liquid when the density is
above 0.01 g/cm3
· Titan, Saturn’s largest and the
Solar System’s second largest
moon, is larger than the planet
Mercury and is the only moon in
the Solar System to retain a sub-
stantial atmosphere
Lizzie Allen IC Captain
his season has been tough with the
weather being the real opponent, but
we’ve pulled through, everyone who’s
stepped out on the the pitch should
be proud of their performances. We
look forward to thwarting the squad
of Elizabeth Joan Allen, having clev-
erly stolen all of the regular goalies so
Lizzie “Flaps” Allen will have to se-
lect a stand in from her vast tapestry
of misﬁts she calls a team. We hope
that their impending defeat won’t
shake their conﬁdence so much that
it results in them under-performing in
their future jobs as beneﬁts sponges,
eternal postgrads and the occasional
waster. In all seriousness, Varsity is
a great challenge to play those whom
we normally play alongside, and this
match will be a great spectacle, as
the teams have never been closer to
equal in their skills in the fastest game
on two feet. Players to watch from
the illustrious ICSM team include
the fresher Lexi and her shooting,
demon-in-defense Shosh and David
Charchoglyan for he has just learnt
the rules.
