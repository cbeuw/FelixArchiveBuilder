FRIDAY 08 MARCH
‘Barbara A.
Pollock’
Death of a Halls of Residence
Students don’t mind sharing a room if it means they can live close
to campus: College should listen to what students want.
his term there has been
week after week of ir-
ritating campus news. It
seems to just keep com-
ing: ﬁrst Acton, then the
murmurs of a potential shut down of
the Translation Studies Unit, and now
Garden Hall. I suspect these are clever
tactics by College, releasing the sup-
posed solution before the proposed
closure, in dribs and drabs as term and
tiredness ensues. Understandably any
innovative institution must cut at the
deadwood; but this is hacking away at
the green branches.
Garden Hall is the place known for
three students bunking to a room; it
is no biggie, and £70 a room for South
Kensington is not half bad. After all,
such options in current times are an
increasing economic reality for many.
his hall helps provide an opportunity
for students from a range of socio-eco-
nomic backgrounds. Garden Hall pro-
vides a foot in the doorway for a few of
the masses to get in. Why else bother
touring our state-schooled children
around the innards of our education
system, if not to provide them with
such tempting carrots later on? In fact,
it is plain darn cruel dangling this hid-
den world in front of their noses and
making the getting there tougher and
tougher. For Pete’s sake, the obstacle
courses of educational diﬀerences
and tuition fees are already enough to
contend with, without adding another
hurdle. Of course, in our Imperial Col-
lege London family, we do not give two
hoots about social mobility. We prefer
to collectively spend money on bottled
water, left on heating/appliances and
on repeatedly replacing our manicured
Queen’s turf. We want to shun our
loveable, benevolent aunt of a building.
Garden Hall is charm incarnate; al-
though this is not in itself a reason to
keep a building, there is always a cer-
tain need for aesthetic pleasures. Not
many student halls are a Grade II listed
building and have patterned, dreamy
ceilings or a wooden lounge. All of this
gives a certain je ne sais quoi; it is our
eccentric aunt amongst the Prince’s
Gardens halls. She is after all what
students want, as evidenced by the
romanticism linked to the campuses
of Oxbridge, Durham and St. An-
drews. For goodness’ sake, if we need
more rooms, why not just buy another
building somewhere nearby and keep
our auntie. But of course I forget: it ap-
pears this is not for Imperial College
London; we prefer sterile, distant, So-
viet spring-ups like Orient House.
Garden consistently tops satisfaction
and demand – never an empty room
– and besides that, it fulﬁls all the cri-
teria in Imperial College’s accommo-
dation strategy. hese shared rooms
right by our lecture halls give a loose
sense of cohesion, student feel and cre-
ate a campus feeling. Although many
of the rooms are shared, students have
the luxury of having pool, library and
campus on their doorstep, which more
than compensates for any inconven-
ience. Speaking of inconveniences,
take a moment and put all of this into
perspective; in Romania for instance,
student holes lack proper shower or
toilet ﬁxtures. his is not saying we
ought to deliberately suﬀer without
proper ﬁxtures, but we should have
some realism. But no, I forgot: we at
Imperial College London do not want
to give luxuries for the few who have
to bunk it out in shared rooms. No, we
don’t want to have the slight treats our
eccentric aunt gives us.
I believe that Garden Halls will go.
Just like the majority of changes across
campus, much of the student body ap-
pear oblivious; self-absorbed and pre-
occupied with deadlines, holidays and
chipped nail woes. Without art stu-
dents, this university lacks the words
to keep the balance in check. Our pre-
enlightenment Buddha-like student
body will not do enough; I am not sure
the word ‘protest’ is even in their lexi-
con. If our students cannot even get us
to creep up the green league from our
bottom position, what hope is there
for anything else? Imperial College
London is an odd place: our brightest
minds churn out leading energy poli-
cies and research but cannot even keep
their own heating in check.
A person or an institution must be
judged by its actions. Imperial Col-
lege’s actions appear to point towards
a lack of commitment towards provid-
ing a range of doorstep accommoda-
tion, keeping academia broad (at least
linguistically) and keeping with energy
standards. All of this is laughable at a
world leading institution, which deigns
to compete with Oxbridge and the Ivy
League. I may be wrong with this ar-
ticle; perhaps there are better replace-
ments being devised which take social
mobility into account, but they do not
appear evident as of yet. Let us wait
with bated breath and crossed ﬁngers,
but I for one am not getting my hopes
up.

£70 a room
for South
Kensington is
not half bad
... and an in-
creasing eco-
nomic reality
for many
In response to “Anger Over New
Halls” (22nd February)
Really, really angry about this. I had a
fantastic time in Garden in ﬁrst year
and it’d be an absolute travesty if it was
to close.
Besides, I stayed in a triple room for
just under £70 a week, which was ace,
at least for my bank account.
Now options like this are systemati-
cally being stripped away to feed dollar
back to he Man and the production of
more JCR baguettes. Probably.
“We want to engage with students to
ﬁnd out what they would like to see
there.
”
Oh wow. Just like you “engaged” in
asking us if we actually want halls there.
Campus Services and College Council
should be ashamed of themselves. hey
have managed to close down Wilson,
Clayponds, the Holland Club and now
this. If there is a prize for the worst stu-
dent support the campus services direc-
tor should get it. If the College ever call
me up asking me for money for the rest
of my life I will tell them where can go!
“Harding-Roots said that “affordable
rents” were the “main focus.
” He said
that College needed a “balanced portfo-
lio, including lower band rooms, which
are under £150 per week.
”
Harding-Roots is also living in a
dream world. Does he think £150/week
is *cheap*? When I was in halls I paid
just under £100/week and even that
completely consumed my student loan.
Close and cheap, but not at such a
high speciﬁcation. If you want luxury,
go private.
he rector has a bigass house, let’s just
move in with him.

In response to “Soap Opera Acton”
(1st March)
I entirely agree that College should keep
Evelyn Gardens open until the end of
the lease. he halls are not in particu-
larly bad condition (with the exception
of Fisher), and would therefore not need
a massive amount of investment over
the next 32 years.
Your argument regarding the lease
extension is, however, misguided. In-
deed, the way a leasehold typically
works is that you pay a large amount
of money upfront to purchase the lease-
hold, every year you pay ground rent
(which is set at the time of the purchase,
and normally doesn’t increase much/
at all after that), and at the end of the
lease, you’re left with nothing.
Because the ground rent will have
been set many decades ago, College
could be paying ground rent of a few
hundred pounds per year (essentially
nothing). You claim that College could
easily negotiate an extension of the
lease, and I’m sure that’s true, but the
costs would be staggering: given the
location, we’re talking 8-9 ﬁgures for a
reasonable extension.

In response to “here is Something
in the Air” (1st March)
A very interesting piece Merry. Some-
thing as a non smoker which I object
to is having to inhale a cloud of smoke
when I walk past your fraternity to en-
ter various buildings around college. If
the college provided bins and so on just
a few metres away from doors and thor-
oughfares, would you begrudge using
them?
I really hate smoking and wish people
didn’t smoke...
hat being said, its someone’s per-
sonal choice to smoke and it isn’t my job
(or anyone else’s) to really pass judge-
ment or try to enforce any restriction
on someone smoking beyond that of the
law and common sense. Its the respon-
sibility of the smoker to stop smoking...
not the majority nor the college.
Like it or not, people do smoke, and
not having provisions for it or attempt-
ing to deny it happens creates more
problems than it ever solves. his is re-
gardless of what the majority’s stance on
smoking actually is.
People should get off their moral
soapboxes; If this was a restriction on
fatty foods or alcohol then there’d be a
different response to this article.
I hate cigarettes and smoking. But I
hate restrictions on a person’s freedom
of choice far far more...
