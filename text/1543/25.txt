STUDENT TRUSTEE
he Trustee Board exists so we can
ensure the union and its activities are
legally compliant and fair; something
I am keen on ensuring. I will ensure
that the union is running and operat-
ing, ﬁrst and foremost for the beneﬁt
of you, the Imperial College Students!
I personally believe that all students
have a say in things concerning them
and so I will actively try to involve
more students in union activities and
decisions.
Perhaps most importantly, I have
the conﬁdence to pipe up in meetings
with the union and college bigwigs
so our voice is not lost. his has been
boosted by over 8 months of work ex-
perience at top tier ﬁnance ﬁrms over
my gap year being a member of the
Students Council at sixth form and
participating in the M.U.N for 3 years.
he work experience will also assist
in scrutinizing the decisions that af-
fect the clubs, for example budgeting.
If you wanted to talk to (or email) me
about something you think could be
important for the Trustees to discuss
or just wanted to come to a meeting
I would be happy to be there for you.
Finally, if I am elected to the Trus-
tee Board, I will not make outlandish
promises about revolutionizing the
union, but what I will ensure is that it
is fair and is always acting to serve its
primary stakeholders: us.
Vote Jay and have your say.

MEDICS PRESIDENT
They are, as the title suggests, the top dog at the Imperial College School of
Medicine Student Union (snappy name, not at all a mouthful). They are re-
sponsible for all activities of ICSMSU. They oversee the actions of all ICSMSU
Exec oicers and chair regular Exec meetings to monitor this. They also repre-
sentthestudentstotheFacultyofMedicine.TheysitonmostFacultyofMedi-
cine Education & Welfare Committees, and chair Staff-Student Liaison Group
meetings. They are the ﬁrst port of call for welfare advice, as well as many
other queries. They also represent the medics on Union committees, such as
the Executive Committee and Union Council.
here is something special about
ICSM students. We are diﬀerent. We
pride ourselves in having the best
medical students’ union in the UK. My
extremely active role within the extra-
curricular aspects of ICSM, coupled
with my current position as ICSMSU
Clubs & Societies Oﬃcer, has allowed
me to collect a wealth of experience
that I hope will hold me in excellent
stead as ICSMSU President.
If elected I would strive to:
Education
• Review the impact the recent ﬁnal
year restructure has had.
• Push to standardise 3rd year so all
students get equivalent clinical expo-
sure.
Sites & Services
• Oversee any changes to the Reyn-
olds building.
• Push for the expansion of the
Reynolds gym.
• Sell ICSM products in the Reyn-
olds.
Graduates & Biomedical Scientists
• Better integrate the Graduate En-
try, Direct Entry and Biomedical stu-
dents into ICSMSU, particularly social
events.
Welfare
• Support all ICSM welfare cam-
paigns.
• Have dedicated drop–in sessions
for students to discuss anything with
me.
Careers
• Review the current UKFPO ap-
plication system. If it is unfavourable
for ICSM students I will campaign for
change via the BMA.
Entertainments
• Review ICSM events in order to
increase the attendance at the Reyn-
olds Bar
Clubs & Societies
• Ensure that our sports teams are
treated fairly and maintain our iden-
tity regardless of the outcome of the
current BUCS situation.
If given the opportunity it would be
an absolute honour to represent you
as the next President of ICSMSU.

Our medical school is constantly
changing - to cope with this, we need
someone with a vision.
hroughout my two years on SU as
Welfare Oﬃcer and an Academic Of-
ﬁcer, I’ve dedicated the majority of my
free time to bettering the experiences
of students; from starting up the suc-
cessful ICSM Notebank, to revamping
the website, to representing and sup-
porting students at a one-to-one level.
All of these roles have been more than
part-time for me.
Allow me to show you what I can do,
by letting me dedicate a whole year to
providing you with the medical school
you want and deserve.
he 4 main areas of my vision are:
Innovation
Push for student-led ideas to im-
prove the personal tutor system, aid
a restructure of year 3 and ensure our
opinions are represented to College.
Community
Developing a community, that lasts
from day one of Freshers’ Fortnight
and extends into your careers; culmi-
nating in an annual Alumni Day.
#TRANsform Reynolds into a mod-
ern bar with furniture and top class
music.
Catering our services to beneﬁt all
students.
Strategy
Planning for our future – Maintain
the unique ICSM identify in the face
of opposition from BUCS, UKFPO
and the hospital closures.
Motivation.
Increasing our online presence with
video blogs
Ensuring all SU oﬃcers have the
support to exceed your expectations
so you can get the best service pos-
sible.
