DEPUTY PRESIDENT
FINANCE & SERVICES
The Deputy President (Finance & Services) is responsible for all of the Un-
ion’s finances and commercial operations. They are basically all about the
cheddar cheese, all about the benjamins… You get the drift: they worry
about money. That’s everything from the finances of all of the clubs to
the bars. They are there to make sure the services are all great and try to
come up with ways that the facilities benefit as many students as pos-
sible. This includes club nights, live bands, pub quizzes and bar nights in
Metric, FiveSixEight and the Union Bar. They are also responsible for the
Union Shop and Newsagent on the main walkway.

In the four years I’ve spent at Imperial,
I’ve held numerous positions in multi-
ple clubs. I’m currently RSM and Dep-
Soc treasurer, roles in which I have
tirelessly worked to organise many
successful, large scale events. I have
worked closely with many students,
the sabbatical team and union staff,
gaining familiarity with union opera-
tions. I have experience dealing with
financial affairs, having interned the
last two summers at a trading services
company in London.
ICU provides a fantastic range of
services and opportunities to a diverse
student body, and I want to ensure that
continues. I have constantly shared my
ideas throughout my time at Imperial,
helping bring about positive changes,
whether that be administrative mat-
ters behind the scenes or negotiating
new drinks deals behind the bar.
As DPFS I will strive to further the
union’s improvement, prioritising the
following:
• Strengthening ties between Impe-
rial students and the union, introduc-
ing convenient ways for students to of-
fer feedback and suggestions that will
be listened to, especially regarding the
content of events in Metric.
• Focus on the little things that mat-
ter, such as making sure booking mini-
buses, equipment or event space is a
streamlined process that works con-
sistently.
• Dedicating time to personally help-
ing students with concerns on a one-
to-one basis, making their lives easier
and the union friendlier.
• Catering for all students, includ-
ing postgraduates and international
students.
My union involvement, financial
knowledge and dedication makes me
the perfect candidate. I will listen to all
students, ensuring I can leave Imperial
proud of my efforts.
