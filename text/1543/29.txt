Head to Head: The Captains’ Interviews
JPR WILLIAMS MATCH
JPR WILLIAMS MATCH
them in general?
It looks like they are competing well in
their league and have rebuilt a strong
squad following their struggles last
season.
What are your memories of Varsity
from the previous years?
I have only been to one last year and
that resulted in a 31-0 victory for IC...
need I say more?
What is your JPR Williams Cup pre-
diction? Overall Varsity winner?
I feel as though the rugby contest will
be tight and a closer outcome than last
year, however I have ultimate faith in
IC dominating. Once again I believe
that IC will be victorious across the
board.
Name a player you expect to stand-
out at Varsity?
here will be standout performances
throughout the squad as everyone
steps up their game, however watch
out for the serious gas out wide and the
crunching hits up front. Once again
looking forward to seeing Spiderpig’s
‘interesting’ kicking tekkers.
How is your season going? Have you
had any memorable moments?
We have had a very enjoyable season
so far and have relished in the oppor-
tunity of playing Prem B level compet-
ing with some of the best rugby univer-
sities in the country.
One memorable moment would be
travelling to Brighton – one of our big-
gest promotion rivals from last season
– and smashing them.
Why do you play rugby? If you were
to play another sport, what would it
be?
I enjoy the sense of camaraderie and
physicality of the game – Rugby is
unique in this aspect. I also like the an-
ticipation of knowing that every week
a new battle will be had on a Wednes-
day afternoon.
Water polo because it has a similar
ethos to rugby in terms of the physical-
ity and technical skill element that is
required under constant pressure and
ﬁtness demands.
What do you think of the opposi-
tion’s season and how do you see
know how demoralising it can be. On
the other hand they’ve scored a num-
ber of tries against strong opposition
so I imagine they’ll be strong in attack.
What are your memories of Varsity
from previous years?
No other day showcases the medic
spirit so well. Nothing beats support-
ing ICSM in the hockey and other
sports at Harlington during the day,
running out in the cup match in the
evening and the epic Reynolds night
afterwards. As the medic underdog
it’s unifying going against the Imperial
hoards.
What is your JPR Williams Cup pre-
diction? Overall Varsity winner?
It’ll be a close one. IMRFC are look-
ing forward to correcting last year’s
wrongs, so it should be a good game
against he Ginger and his merry
men.
Overall I think this year probably IC
(as long as Badminton continues to be
played at Varsity).
Name a player you expect to stand-
out at Varsity?
Anyone wearing a phoenix.
How is your season going? Have
you had any memorable mo-
ments?
IMRFC have had a strong season, as
the season has progressed we’ve con-
tinued to improve. Memorable mo-
ments would be strong wins in our
league, playing in some of the worst
conditions known to man, a great tour
to Nottingham and the odd bit of de-
bauchery oﬀ the pitch.
Why do you play rugby? If you were
to play another sport, what would it
be?
Man is caged by the conﬁnes of soci-
ety, culture and education. Rugby is
just an outlet. If I didn’t play rugby I’d
be in prison. I deﬁnitely wouldn’t join
Boat Club.
What do you think of the opposi-
tion’s season and how do you see
them in general?
It seems they’ve had a very tough sea-
son, much like ours last year. I don’t
envy them losing every game as I
