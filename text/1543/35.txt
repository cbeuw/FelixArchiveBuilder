Women’s rugby have had a great season and are currently undefeated in BUCS,
chasing promotion to BUCS prem. In LUSL, after narrowly loosing to RVC by
one point, we can still win the league, but it will come down to a grudge match
against UCL on the last weekend of the season. As a club we are mixed with
both medics and IC and so for Varsity we split the team in half and play 7’s or
10’s against each other. Despite the fact that we know one another very well our
competitive spirit always takes over and it is a ﬁercely fought game, although the
medics have never lost Varsity and are looking to continue this winning streak
in 2013!
Two of the leading try scorers for the team, Kath Fok and Sammy Gottardi,
are both medics and so are deﬁnitely ones for IC to watch out for. However the
IC team this year will be one of their strongest yet, with the injection of some
talented freshers such as Joules Lennon and Carolanne Vouriot this years Varsity
is set to be tighter than ever.
WATERPOLO
1ST Team Captain
Andeas Thomik
A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far
away, the medics won a Varsity water
polo game. Or so they say. No one in
living memory can remember a time
where Imperial College water polo did
not completely and utterly defeat the
medics at a Varsity match.
hat’s not to say we don’t like the
medics. Joining forces, Imperial water
polo got further than ever this BUCS
season, dwarﬁng even the highest
hopes, the maddest dreams. But for
just one hour on this Wednesday 13th
of March, these good friends will be-
come our worst enemies. No other
match, no matter how important, has
the intensity of a game against the
Medics. Trunks will be pulled, people
will be drowned and goal-nets will get
stretched until the very last second of
the last quarter.
And when waves of the swimming
pool have settled again and everyone
is good friends once more, the medics
will not have written history.
Hopefully.

he start of the 2012 season heralded
a new era for ICSM Water Polo. Inter-
national semi-professionals and home
grown GB talent ﬂocked to us like ran-
dy freshers racing to the free condom
stash in the healthcare centre. Add
them to the players we’ve been coach-
ing for up to six years and you get a
force so strong that our fans say watch-
ing us play is like watching Japanese
sumo wrestlers ﬁght toddlers in a play-
pen- you know who’ll come out on top.
A sudden bout of TB in southwest
London struck down many of our play-
ers and helped IC to a narrow victory in
our LUSL ﬁxture. We’ve got bad news
for IC though: we cured TB and we are
back, hungry for blood.
Ones to watch: T. Badenoch- if his
beard doesn’t drown him, he’ll drown
you. K. Khan- don’t mess with her,
Andy won’t like it. D. Mitakos- (not so
secret anymore) weapon vs IC ladies-
he’ll charm the speedos oﬀ you. M.
Hall- has a great bod.
