Roxanne Middleton, 4th year
Physics student at Imperial Col-
lege, Garden Hall Resident
2009/2010.
Garden hall is one of the few things
that makes Imperial students
proud of their university, proud to
be an Imperial student and makes
them feel that the university cares
about them. Without these vital
feelings, it becomes more and
more desolate to start university at
Imperial at age eighteen.
Alexandra Turner, BSc in Math-
ematics at Imperial College Lon-
don, MSc in Medical Statistics at
the London School of Hygiene
and Tropical Medicine, Garden
Hall Resident 2009/2010
Garden hall gives such a unique
university experience to those
lucky enough to live there. The
building is beautiful and has such
character, on top of which the set-
ting of Prince’s Gardens, right next
to Hyde Park and the Albert Hall
is amazing and the joy of living
here shouldn’t be denied to future
students.
Kelvin Wong, Master in Math-
ematics, University of Cambridge,
Garden Hall Resident 2009/2010
Garden Hall is one of the only Col-
lege owned Halls of Residences
that preserves the character of
the area in which the University’s
main campus is in. The proximity
of the hall to the main campus ac-
tively encourages students to get
involved with extra curricular ac-
tivities, which are largely based on
the South Kensington campus and
often run until quite late, I believe
that the lack of affordable accom-
modation close to College would
be a huge loss to freshers hoping
to enjoy the university experience
and would adversely affect the al-
ready embarrassingly low student
satisfaction levels.
Kelvin Wong, Master in Math-
ematics, University of Cambridge,
Garden Hall Resident 2009/2010
Garden Hall is the only Impe-
rial hall that possesses real inspi-
rational character! To take it away
from the freshers is probably the
single worst thing Imperial Col-
lege could do to its students and I
would instantly lose respect for the
university and how it is run if this
were to happen. Not only would
I withdraw my future support of
the university I would encourage
all my friends to do similarly and
launch a campaign to see the uni-
versity put in better hands.

The university has made too many
decisions in recent years without
fair consultation and accurate re-
flection of the opinions of its stu-
dents. These decisions may have
made some economic sense but
none of these benefits have found
their way back to the students.
With each decision they’ve taken
more away than they’ve provided
and anything they have provided
has gone unnoticed or unwanted!

If they continue to damage what
it means to be an Imperial student
and move further from student-
centric business models they may
find themselves with the shiniest,
facility-rich, efficient, soul-drain-
ing machine in all of London; short
term gains will be far outweighed
by the rapid decline in the per-
centages of this country’s (and
others) sharpest minds that wish
to attend the university. Imperial’s
reputation will inevitably similarly
plummet and those responsible for
these decisions will be identified
and held accountable.

I strongly encourage relevant in-
dividuals to reflect on these views
and those of other students past
and present, the university’s future,
and their reasons for working in
this sector before potentially mak-
ing one of the most disappointing
mistakes of their career.
Sean Lucent was in Garden and
Weeks 2009 - 2012, Weeks for
the first two of those years and
Garden for his final year because
he had spent so much of his time
there the year before.
I wasn’t in Garden (or Weeks) for
my first year (though Garden was
the hall I was hoping to be as-
signed to) and I saw almost all the
halls of residence in my first year
firsthand - Garden was the only
hall that felt like a home to me and
not a hotel and I loved being part
of the Garden and Weeks commu-
nity so much I never once consid-
ered anywhere else.
It’s not just the people (great
people are to be found in all of Im-
perial’s halls), it’s the way Garden
and Weeks in particular provide
an environment that encourages
its residents to get together. Gar-
den is pretty maze-like in its layout
and that’s brilliant; you get used to
it pretty quickly and it breaks from
the clear divisions of sectioned
floors that you get with other halls.
I feel I had more opportunity to
meet and talk to everyone in that
hall than I would have done in any
of the others.
Isaac Gentle, 3rd year Imperial
College student, Garden Hall Resi-
dent 2010/2011
I would not have come to imperial,
if it weren’t for the double and tri-
ple rooms (which are affordable)
of halls like garden. Current plans
are not a replacement of garden.
They are a catering for a richer
market alienating the poor. Yet
again, this just serves to reinforce
the importance of money to the
college over people.
Abigail Laverack
I am a resident at Fisher Hall and I
resent the proposals to price peo-
ple like me out of Imperial College
London.
Jane Courtnell, 1st year Biology
student at Imperial College, Gar-
den Hall Resident 2012/2013
Garden Halls is cheap accommo-
dation that is close to campus, and
therefore its closure will have a
greater impact on poorer students.
Victoria Walshaw
If Imperial really cared about im-
proving it’s student satisfaction
levels, they shouldn’t be send-
ing fresher students even further
away.
Celine Tang, 3rd year Imperial
College student, Garden resident
2010/2011 and 2012/2013
Garden is just an amazing halls
that is close to imperial, cheap and
has such a friendly close knit com-
munity. It would have such a huge
impact on first year students to
close this halls.
Anran Cheng, 1st year Imperial
College student, Garden resident
2012/2013
I just love Garden! It is the best
place I could imagine for students.
Wardens and students living here
are just like a big family. It is super-
close to the uni and therefore pro-
vides excellent opportunities for us
to participate in different activi-
ties. It is just so important for fresh-
ers! They would definitely lose a lot
if the hall is closed!
Katy Sayer, 1st year
If cheap, close rooms hadn’t been
available at Imperial I would have
had to go elsewhere. Garden and
Weeks is a really close-knit, friend-
ly and diverse community; to close
Garden would close a wide range
of opportunities for a lot of peo-
ple, meaning less well-off students
could end up spending all their
time travelling, having less time to
study and take part in extra-cur-
ricular activities than those in East-
side and Southside. Save Garden!
Kristel Fobelets
I believe we have to support our
students who are coming from a
less well-off backgrounds. Paying
back a heafty student loan is not a
healthly start to a young person’s
career.
Eleanor Jay
As a Sub-Warden of Garden hall
for 4 years (2008-12), I can affirm
that the hall, although needing
some rennovations, is a vibrant
and well loved place. Unlike many
of its contemporaries, Garden hall
offers rooms which are affordable
to those who simply cannot afford
to pay the extortionate rents of
other residences; these frequently
exceed the student loan.
Clearly a range of housing <£100
pw is in need at Imperial and with-
out Garden this will be lost and a
generation of bright, aspiring stu-
dents will be unable to learn and
develop themselves at Imperial
College London.

One of the roles of the university is
to provide freshers with affordable
accommodation close to college,
and closing garden hall is yet an-
other step away from this for Im-
perial. Keep Garden open!
Ivan Brown
From what I have gathered from
those living in Paragon and Xenia
halls, they find it a lot more incon-
venient to socialize with others
from their course. Garden Halls
are conveniently placed, and Ac-
ton less so.
Andrei Cioara
Student life is busy anyway. When
you pay more to travel more, there
is surely something wrong going
on. Everyone envies Garden Hall
residents for good reason.
Angus Bayley
[I signed the petition] Because I’m
worried that the college may be
pricing the less privileged out of
their first choice education.
Maksymilian Wiśniowski
In two years I would like to apply
to Imperial College (Biochemisry).
One of the main reasons I wanted
to do so was the low cost of acco-
modationinGardenHall.Ithought
that Garden Hall was going to be
the place where I could place my
first steps in the “new world” - Lon-
don :) . I need you Garden Hall !
Celine Tang
I have lived in Garden for 2 years
of my time at Imperial. It is close,
cheap, convenient and has a really
close knit community in Imperial.
It fulfils all the requirements and
expectations of a student hall and
should not be closed.
Lish Zhang
It’s brilliantly convenient and a re-
ally nice place, give others the op-
portunity to be so lucky!
Florence Chow
I was very fortunate to have lived
in G&W in my first year. The size
of the rooms, historic architec-
ture, proximity to the college and
price made it an ideal hall of resi-
dence to live in. It is saddening to
hear that G&W will potentially
be closed. I strongly believe that
G&W should remain open, allow-
ing more students to experience its
charms.
Philippe Rival
Garden Hall is an important part
of Imperial College London history
Chris Roberts
The college needs to stop thinking
of it’s commercial needs, and lis-
ten to it’s students - without them,
there wouldn’t even be an Imperial
College.
Severine Marechal
After Clayponds, Garden, Evelyn
Gardens... the entire ICL accom-
modation landscape changing
against welfare and living prin-
ciples. So much for Imperial Stu-
dent experience improvement! We
might as well be renamed Imperial
College Southeast...
Charlene Valencia
My brother lived here. It is an
amazing place for 1st year stu-
dents getting to grips with living
in London, esp with premium rates
and cost of living. To lose it would
be a travesty to future students.
Andrew Bromley
Because the average person is be-
ing priced out of London and this is
a ridiculous price to expect a stu-
dent, let alone someone who is in
full time employment to pay
Caroline Glassberg-Powell
Affordable housing that is close to
campus enables a smooth transi-
tion to adult life for 1000’s of fresh-
ers every year, cutting away the
complexities of long commutes,
unsavory neighbourhoods, and
added transportation costs. I be-
lieve that preserving Garden Hall
will improve the quality of Imperial
students’ lives.
Quddous Ahmed
Student halls matter. The experi-
ence of living in London for a stu-
dent is perhaps a once in a lifetime
opportunity so why take it away?
