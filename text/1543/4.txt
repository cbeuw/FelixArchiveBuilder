Imperial trailing in equal
access to education
Padraic Calpin Reporter

A recent article in The Economist
analysed social mobility (or rather
a lack thereof) in the USA, focus-
ing on education. Extensive dis-
course took place surrounding a
modern phenomenon known as
‘virtuous meritocracy’. In basic
terms, it has its origins in previ-
ous American governmental pol-
icy. Concessions were repeatedly
awarded to school pupils from
humble backgrounds considered
‘bright’. Many were actively con-
sumed into the Ivy League and
State University ranks via schol-
arships and funding. In turn this
select core of students secured
the most coveted (and highest
earning) business and academic
positions upon graduation. It will
be no surprise to learn that they
were intent on retaining what
they had achieved ‘on merit’; their
endeavours were the embodiment
of the American dream. However,
like many aspects of a changing
modern America, the dream has
been tainted. Some argue that this
group of intelligent nouveau riche
monopolise both jobs and educa-
tion, passing their emancipation
(and their money) onto their chil-
dren, with the squeezed middle
and working class losing out.
Addressing the 2010/2011 sta-
tistics recently published by the
Higher Education Statistics Agen-
cy this may also be a problem
much closer to home. Consider
the ‘big academic three’ UK Uni-
versities (The University of Ox-
ford, The University of Cambridge
& Imperial College London). Un-
dergraduate participants from
disenfranchised ‘low participa-
tion neighbourhoods’ comprised
2.5%, 3.1% and 4.6 % respectively.
These figures are significantly low
with respect to the overall UK
University average of 10.5%.
The statistics relevant to Impe-
rial College London can be ration-
alised. First and foremost the high
proportion of overseas students
must be taken into account; In-
ternational fees cannot be classed
The Virtuous Meritocracy
as cheap, frequently breaking the
£20,000 barrier. The location of
the College within one of the most
financially draining cities on the
planet inevitably plays its part. In
addition to this the institution is
widely renowned but principally
within academic circles.
From the HESA statistics these
factors have a strong influence
on the student demographic. It
cannot be denied that Imperial
College London best endeavours
to provide a first-class educa-
tion to all students, championing
many schemes such as the College
Hardship Fund. On a student-
by-student basis this assistance
is invaluable. It might therefore
be concluded that the trend ob-
served in the wider student popu-
lation reflects a monopoly headed
by those in a position to afford the
best in a growing market of global
education.
So what might be done about
this? There needs to be a re-set-
ting and subsequent balance of
the student demographic of top
academic institutions across the
planet, with sufficient contribu-
tion from the ‘low participation
neighbourhoods’. A fresh wave
of outreach media should be con-
sidered in order to scout underly-
ing, hidden talent within school
pupils from working class back-
grounds. Judging from statistics
published on Wednesday by the
End Child Poverty campaign this
may be particularly applicable
to the United Kingdom, where
areas such as West Belfast (with
43% of children raised in pov-
erty) and factions of Manchester
are in desperate need of revival.
This might reduce the advantage
that pupils from financially sound
backgrounds invariably possess,
be it in the form of private tuition
or exposure to academic rigour. In
this way a turn of fortune might
be granted to a new generation of
disenfranchised but academically
gifted pupils, allowing them their
fair share in the cake of merit.

At the core of student opposition to the
College’s decision to close Garden Hall
and open a new residence in North Ac-
ton is a concern for Imperial’s less well
oﬀ students. Campus Services seems to
have demonstrated an utter disregard
for the possibility that poorer students
may be forced out oﬀ campus, sepa-
rated from their classmates and their
union. his raises diﬃcult questions;
what proportion of Imperial’s students
come from less privileged economic
backgrounds, and how do we compare
to other institutions? Is Imperial ‘needs
blind’
, or a science, medicine and engi-
neering ﬁnishing school?
To answer this, Felix has turned to the
Performance Indicator data sets made
available by the Higher Education Sta-
tistics Authority (HESA), which aim to
evaluate the success of UK HE institu-
tions in widening student provision,
teaching outcomes and other factors.
Unfortunately, currently available data-
sets only run to the 2010/11 admissions
period, meaning the impact of the fees
increase cannot be considered, but the
data speaks volumes.
he tables give the proportion of
young, ﬁrst-time degree students com-
ing from State Schools, as well as the
percentage coming from poorer socio-
economic backgrounds (National Sta-
tistics Socio-Economic Classes 4-7).
he latter measure is an established
national measure of socio-economic
background based on current employ-
ment that was developed for the 2001
census.
Imperial is consistently signiﬁcantly
(p<0.05) below the national average
in both measures, with an average of
62.9% of students coming from state
schools, and 17.25% from NS-SEC
classes 4-7 over the period 06/07-10/11.
his is compared to the UK averages of
88.4% and 30% respectively; almost 4 in
10 Imperial students come from private
education, and the vast majority come
from more privileged economic back-
grounds.
hat said, it is interesting to compare
our performance with that of near-
rivals and fellow Russell Group institu-
tions, Oxford, Cambridge and UCL. In
both measures, we perform compara-
bly to UCL, and consistently better than
Oxbridge in terms of equal access to
learning. Considering the statistics also
aim to evaluate to what extent institu-
tions can widen participation in Higher
Education, the lack of any improvement
across the years is also concerning.
However, for a more valid assessment
of Imperial’s performance, we should
consider the “Benchmark” perfor-
mance put together by the HESA. he
benchmark scores attempt to control
for other factors, to give a measure of
how well a given institution ‘should’ be
performing based on factors such as
location, subject, gender and ethnic-
ity of applicants. Signiﬁcant variation
away from these benchmarks can be
used to infer additional factors aﬀect-
ing an institution’s admissions, or may
suggest an inﬂuence that has not been
accounted for.
When it comes to percentage of
students from state schools, Impe-
rial performed signiﬁcantly below its
benchmark percentage every year in
the period 06/07-10/11. he picture
for socio-economic class was more var-
ied, with Imperial alternately punch-
ing above and below expected values,
but never with a statistically signiﬁcant
variation.
hat Imperial doesn’t vary signiﬁ-
cantly from the expected proportion
from lower NS-SEC classes, despite
the higher than average number of
students from private schools, is per-
haps testament to the College’s support
provision. For example, Study Support
Bursaries are available to all UK stu-
dents receiving a maintenance grant.
he below expected percentage of state
school students, however, lacks a clear
explanation.
Taken alongside the nationally low
averages of Imperial and other Russell
Group institutions, the data seems to
reveal structural problems in the Brit-
ish education system. Imperial’s high
grade requirements mean that students
from better oﬀ backgrounds can end up
over represented.
he new Pro-Rector (Education) has
stated that the College has expanded
its outreach programme, aiming to en-

courage more students to apply to uni-
versity and to Imperial. But outreach
is just one aspect that can inﬂuence
access to Higher Education from less
privileged backgrounds, and, as these
statistics highlight, the College can still
improve substantially. Positive discrim-
ination policies, such as ﬂexible grade
boundaries, do not necessitate sacriﬁc-
ing academic standards.
