Park Chan-Wook’s long-awaited
English-language ﬁlm debut is a
wondrous mixture of oddity, taste-
ful madness and gothic beauty. here
isn’t a single sane, well-grounded or
normal character here, and it’s that
volatile family dynamic that lights
the fuse and keeps the tension sim-
mering throughout.
India’s (Wasikowska) life is turned
upside down when news of her fa-
ther’s sudden tragic accidental death
hits home. Her mother Evelyn (Kid-
man) is an emotional wreck, only
comforted by the mysterious appear-
ance of Charles (Goode), the charm-
ing, clean-cut younger brother of her
deceased husband. Faced with an
illusive uncle she never thought she
had, India keeps her distance, (as she
often does with everyone – at school,
at home), and keeps a close eye on
this man who seems too good to be
true.
And of course, the creepy smiles,
the odd looks, the hazy past, the good
manners all suggest something is oﬀ
and it isn’t long before anyone who
appears to know more than they let
on starts disappearing; most notably
housekeeper Mrs. Garnish (Phyllis
Somerville) who is startled by his re-
turn, and Aunt Gin (Weaver in a brief
but sporadically funny turn), who be-
comes too inquisitive and potentially
helpful to India.
What develops is an uncomfort-
able, unsettling incestuous love
triangle between the three main
characters that constantly keeps eve-
ryone on edge. His immediate eﬀect
on the grieving widow is an obvious
one: as evidenced by Kidman’s spot-
on transition from the withdrawn
and depressed, (no-one can do this
better than the pale, slender, blood-
shot-eyed Kidman) to the more lively
and enthusiastic. As Evelyn begins
to catch onto Charlie’s motives and
starts to see India as a potential com-
petitor, the cold, icy, steely-eyed side
kicks in, again, something Kidman
truly dominates.
It’s also remarkable to see Goode ﬁ-
nally landing a role he can shine in, as
his previous leading eﬀorts have been
duds (Leap Year, Brideshead Revis-
ited). Here is a performance of such
unique peculiarity and fascination
that he brings out much aura of am-
biguity in his villainous character. He
casually glides through and seduces
his way into Evelyn and India’s world,
almost hypnotising those around
him (including one highly erotically
charged piano duet).
To further enhance the mystery el-
ement, director Park goes all out in
creating such a vivid yet constantly
haunting series of images and scen-
ery, mounting one gothic set-piece
after another. he many references
to classic fairy-tale stories here are
clearly made, although these aren’t
the ones you traditionally hear about
– instead with Wentworth Miller’s
twisted script and Park’s masterful
direction successfully putting even
darker turns into the narrative. His
cameras linger back and forth clev-
erly, positioning itself to focus on all
the right key moments, which give
rise to some shockingly gruesome
moments.
Placed at the centre of it all is
Wasikowska, who has the most chal-
lenging role yet of her career, as the
girl coming of age, becoming a fully-
grown woman, ready to step away
from her childhood conﬁnement to
take matters into her own hands.
Her maturation process is essentially
what the ﬁlm is all about – as a social
outcast she sees things others can’t,
and hears things others cannot – and
with this eccentric, almost supernat-
ural quirk, Wasikowska plays around
her character, ultimately blossoming
into an unlikely heroine with ques-
tionable morality.
All this, backed by some superb
music composition that perfectly
conveys the sinister mood, is why
Parker is without a doubt one of the
best ﬁlms of this year so far – we’re
only still in March of 2013, but this
will be one that lingers in your mind
in the most uncomfortable, disturb-
ing way possible – which is precisely
what Park’s ﬁlms (Sympathy for Mr.
Vengeance, Oldboy, Sympathy for
Lady Vengeance) are all really aim-
ing for.
