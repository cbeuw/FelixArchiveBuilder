of freehold”. Evidently Garden Hall
meets spectacularly all the above.”
he petition states that Garden Hall
is popular amongst students and is
always in demand as there are never
empty rooms and it is always oversub-
scribed. Imperial College Union have
conﬁrmed that it is the most oversub-
scribed hall at Imperial.
he students have made signs and
posters and stuck them up in their
rooms and around campus. here
are big “SOS” letters in the windows
of the rooms and kitchens, and there
are many “Save Garden Hall” posters
visible from the outside. he atmos-
phere at the hall while taking a photo
of students outside was one of worry,
uncertainty, anger, and general con-
fusion over any potential closure of
Garden. Students were motivated and
determined to make their views heard
by College.
Speaking outside Garden, Union
President, Paul Beaumont, said: “It’s
wonderful to see so many students
being vocal, especially because they
won’t actually be here when Garden
closes, so it’s great to see so many
people looking out for the welfare of
future students”. Temi Ladega, CGCU
President, said that he was “extremely
disappointed with what College are
doing”. He went on to say: “I think it’s
time that College start caring about
students and not just their ﬁnances”.
Many of the Garden residents ex-
pressed their dismay as well. Tim
Lam, a 1st year, said, “the possible clo-
sure of Garden Hall makes me feel like
Imperial doesn’t care about students
at all and makes me think that maybe
the people in charge are just money
driven”. Rebecca Rove, a 3rd year hall
senior, said that the location and price
were key. She said that it allowed her
to participate more in university life
than she could if she were further
away. She went on to say, “If cheap
rooms were not available in my ﬁrst
year I would not have chosen to come
to Imperial”.
Garden Hall is in a listed building
and is the most oversubscribed hall;
it houses 84 students in a mixture
of single, double and triple rooms.
hese rooms form some of the cheap-
est accommodation options on oﬀer
at Imperial. It recently emerged that
there is the possibility of it closing to
become oﬃce space or anything else
needed. he reason given is that space
is tight on the South Kensington cam-
pus. It was claimed that the hall is in
need of refurbishing and is not in a
good state. he students living there,
however, seem to be happy enough
with it. he petition closes with the
following plea: “Please return student
priorities to the centre, keep Garden
Hall and invest in this important
space. his will mean a great deal to
students and staﬀ.”
It is known that College are going
to be discussing Garden Hall and its
future on 20 March. his meeting will
be one of the Management Board’s
regular meetings. he Management
Board is one of the most senior boards
in College and is chaired by the Presi-
dent & Rector. he Union have re-
quested to be allowed to attend this
to allow their point of view to be put
forward. he Union have sent a letter
to the President & Rector. At time of
going to print, they have not received
a reply.
he protest comes in the wake of the
news about new halls being planned
in Acton, which was denounced by
many students due to distance and
cost. here is also the possibility that
the halls in Evelyn Gardens could be
closed as the lease has just over 30
years left on it, and the negotiations
with the Wellcome Trust, who own
the lease, appear to reportedly indi-
cate that they are not willing to extend
the lease. he College, at the minute,
seem unwilling to renovate the halls
unless there is an extension. he lease
will be worth less and less as it gets
closer to the end.
