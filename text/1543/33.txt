Imperial 1s reach the business end of the
season top of both their BUCS and LUSL
leagues and in the LUSL cup semi-ﬁnal,
vying to reach the ﬁnal for the 4th year
running. Multiculturalism is a quintes-
sential factor for the team’s success, inte-
grating French ‘Je ne sais quoi’
, German
eﬃciency and Greek austerity. he IC-
UAFC 1s defence has been compared to
Arsenal’s Invincible Team of 2003-2004,
inarecentissueof4-4-2magazine,whilst
Messi ruled out a move to the illustrious
club due to his desire for playing time.
A return to form for Robinson and
Murphy ensures goals will be aplenty,
meanwhile Bjorkstrand himself has been
struggling to miss the target. Whilst his-
torically this ﬁxture is often something of
a whitewash, the opposition will not be
underestimated, and a good result would
be a conﬁdence boost ahead of the pos-
sible LUSL Cup Final on the 16th March.
We know Varsity will be a game of two
halves. Unless it goes to extra time in
which case it will be a game of four
halves, maybe penalties too. And great
Odin’s raven, any game that deﬁes the
laws of mathematics like that must be
pretty damn important.
We’ll have to put in 100% and try to
win all the 50:50 challenges, but if we
put in 110% then by my calculations
we’ll be going in 55:50 and so winning
everything. And 60% of the time my
calculations work every time.
Playing in Varsity can feel as though
you’re in a glass case of emotion, and we
may have to play ugly to win, but by the
beard of Zeus we’ll be bringing along
some particularly ugly players to help
against our inevitably stiﬀ opposition.
At the end of the day we can only
do our best and hope that our family,
friends and lamps still love us when the
ﬁnal whistle blows. You stay classy, Im-
perial College.

Yeah, so mens rugby may be the ﬂagship
event of Varsity, but for the cool, under-
ground hipsters there is only one event
worth talking about: IC Mens Football 2s
v Imperial Medics 2s. he big one. he
game will literally be decided by who wins
the all important ﬁrst tackle, who wants
it more and which team can get it on
the deck and play football. Expect some
questionable balls played in the mixer and
some gambling at the back stick, because
you never know who will win the ﬂick on
and get the second ball. No doubt the ref
will be crap, linesmen will cheat and the
team that loses 5-0 will lament the unfair-
We have had a largely successful sea-
son so far, being upper mid table in
our LUSL and BUCS leagues. Our
major success, though, has been in
the LUSL Cup where we beat Impe-
rial College in the Quarter Finals to
make it to a semi-ﬁnal against London
School of Economics. Players to look
out for include: Joe Barker, a solid
traditional defensive midﬁeld player
who loves putting in a big tackle, Karl
Elmqvist, a handy right midﬁelder
fresher who’s good on the ball going
forward and has impressed for the 2s
this season, and ﬁnally Mustafa Fran-
ka, a solid right back who’s quick and
dependable.

ness of the scoreline (“we lost 5-0, but it
should’ve been a draw!”).
IC Mens football 2s have had a very
good season, winning 10 games in a row
in ﬁrst term. Results have been less good

players to the 1s, but the general perfor-
mance levels have been a vast improve-
ment on previous 2s seasons. Having re-
cently beaten Medic 1s 4-1, and playing in
a league above the Medic 2s, we are ﬁrm

from their opening 5 games in BUCS.

Jack Peacock (JT2Y) in both Bayswater
and Hammersmith. With only 3 games
remaining the team still have everything
to play for as although the promotion of
several key players (Judas, Giles Marvis)
andaspateofinjuriesthreatenedtoderail
the title push, some serious resolve was
shown to grind out results and the team
remains top in BUCS and in a promo-
tion position in LUSL. he 3s head into
varsity in particularly conﬁdent mood
boasting a 100% record in derby games
this year having bested the 4s in LUSL
and completed the BUCS league double
over ICSM 2s. Look for medics’ defector
Myles Jarvis to pin his colours to the IC-
UAFC mast with a telling performance!
As we all look forward to the day when
spurious civility is thrown aside and
the true ICSM/IC divide is put on
show, when IC’s best poster makers
snigger at all the ingenious and original
ways they can ﬁt the word ‘dick ‘ into
the word medic, you have to stop and
ask, does this rivalry stem from a deep
seeded jealousy and feeling of inferior-
ity, or are we really just the pompous
self-entitled arseholes you paint us to
be? I guess we’ll ﬁnd out. he 3s go into
this one on ﬁne form, on for promotion
in both leagues and with a cup run in
full steam we look to bring the hurt on
the 13th. To quote the late Christopher
George Latore Wallace; “Disrespect my
click, my shit’s Imperial, fuck around
and made her milkbox material”. Very
apt I think you’ll agree, but regardless
of the overall result of Varsity the true
question is who is going to have the
better night?

Despite a few blips along the way, the
season has been successful, with Impe-
rial 4s currently sitting third in the Satur-
day league and fourth in the Wednesday
league, despite having played the least
amount of games. A strong ﬁnish to the
season could potentially leave us ﬁghting
for the title and, with our recent form in-
cludingeightgoalsinourpasttwogames,
it’sanexcitingprospect.Varsitywillbean
opportunity for next year’s captain, yet to
be decided, to have a go at captaining the
team and will be the last varsity for sever-
al members of the team. Players to watch
include Nozomi Satake who was plucked

We all know how important Varsity is
for both sides. It’s one of the biggest
games of the year and one that we
are deﬁnitely excited for. A lot of new
players have joined this year, and have
been a real asset to the club as a whole,
but especially the 4s.
We have acquired quite a few play-
ers from IC this year, who came across
having realised the error of their ways.
We will go out there knowing that
the pressure is on IC, we’ll just play
our game and get some more points
on the board for the medics.
See you there!
