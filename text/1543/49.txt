FRIDAY 08 FEBRUARY
50
rior to last Friday it’d
been a good year since
I was last at XOYO.
In 2010, when it ﬁrst
opened, the initial
excitement was of a club with the
line-ups and support that could have
proved a replacement for he End.
However something just wasn’t right
about the lay-out and the sweat-drip-
ping ceiling com-
bined with line-
ups deviating
from my tastes
meant that I only
ended up going
about ﬁve times.
But the potential
for the night held
last Friday was
so great I’d have
probably gone
had it been held
in the Great Hall.
Probably.
Deviation is
a night that sorely underrated DJ,
Benji B, started ﬁve years ago to break
up the monotony of working for ﬁve
straight days. Held on a Wednesday,
its crowd had to be loyal and serious
about their music; getting the likes of
Dam Funk, Jackmaster, Mala, heo
Parrish and Joy O to grace the Com-
mercial Street arches on a Wednesday
night is no mean feat. But Benji B is
no amateur; starting his career at KISS
FM before moving to Radio 1Xtra to
host his own show a decade ago, the
London DJ has been a great promoter
of all things experimental yet soulful
in electronic music. From introducing

the UK to Flying Lotus to exposing
the world to the UK’s underground
scene, Benji B has never been part of
any real clique, rather preferring to do
things his way.
his year Deviation has moved from
its midweek enclave to prime-time
Friday night at one of London’s biggest
clubs, XOYO. Last Friday was the sec-
ond of the new residency for the club
night, boasting a
line-up that was
indicative of the
serious talents
that have been
booked for the
club night over
the next few
months. Em-
ploying none
less than Ac-
tress and Jamie
XX to bring the
party, I was con-
vinced that I’d
ﬁnd my missing
love for the club that night.
As we entered, Actress was prepar-
ing to take to the decks. Expecting a
deep and twisted set of spaced-out
techno, we were ready to ﬂy. Unfor-
tunately the diﬀerence between the
music Actress makes and what he
DJs is quite stark and after taking an
unexpected R&B hit, we headed for a
smoke. It’s not that the guy can’t DJ,
or even that I disliked the music he
played – far from it – it just felt out of
place coming from a guy that makes
some of the freshest sounding elec-
tronic music in the UK today.
Following Actress was Jamie XX
P
who had been given a substantial
set in comparison to his precursor.
Just like Actress, Jamie XX is a pro-
ducer ﬁrst and DJ second, and this is
perhaps what let the night down. As
ever Jamie’s selection was faultless,
yet he still hasn’t managed to iron
out the clashing mixes that have put
a dampener on many of his sets for
me (although admittedly he seemed
to nail more of the mixes as his set
progressed). As the night ticked
closer to and past 3am (the crimi-
nally early closing time for the club)
people started to trickle out, yet at
around half past Benji B returned to
the decks to play one almighty ﬁnale.
Some call it lazy DJ-ing, but really it
was genuinely the most fun I’ve had in
a club in months; tunes from Kend-
rick Lamar, Joy O and TNGHT were
just a few of the ‘best of 2012’ ﬁnale
that we were treated to. And the ic-
ing on the cake? As the lights came on
and people started ﬁling out, a request
from the booth was shouted down to
the ﬂoor, “Techno or Disco?”. A unani-
mous swell of “Disco” emanated from
the crowd before ‘Stand On he Word’
by he Joubert Singers swept across
the danceﬂoor to close Deviation for
another month.
So while XOYO still failed to win me
round, the quality of the music and of
the crowd meant that I’ll be spending
more Friday evenings sweating and
dancing in that club just oﬀ the Old
Street roundabout.
