FRIDAY 08 MARCH
The Next Adventure: The Start-up Life
Natasha Hodgson presents the benefits of an alternative career path
he Next Adventure: Why
he Start-Up Life Might
Be For You.
It’s a strange thing, the
transition from univer-
sity to the world beyond. For people
used to setting their own schedules,
to blazing a bit of a trail, to grabbing
the talented people around them to
embark on a creative project, it can
feel like a bit like hem Days Are End-
ing. It’s time to settle down, get a Real
Job, and accept the inevitability of the
corporate grind. Helpful, that’s abso-
lutely untrue.
With the current boom in creative
and tech startups, it’s a very exciting
time for young, ambitious graduates.
Inspiring, small and innovative com-
panies are popping up all over the
UK, and as their ideas come to frui-
tion, they are looking increasingly to
spirited graduates to join their teams
and create the super-
powers of tomorrow.
So what’s the diﬀer-
ence between work-
ing for a startup and
a larger, more estab-
lished company?
For a start, it’s about
culture. In a company
where hierarchy, roles
and skillsets have
yet to be
firmly
T
”
...it’s a very
exciting time
for young,
ambitious
graduates
established (or indeed, will never
be), it’s an amazing opportunity for
a graduate to stretch their skills and
talents across a lot of diﬀerent areas.
Upon arriving, every member of the
team is expected to help steer the
company to success – the likelihood
of you photocopying and making tea
for six months is pretty unlikely. Of
course, such an prospect won’t be
for everyone, but for those hungry to
learn, to develop and to help some-
thing they believe in grow, it’s diﬃcult
to see why they’d want to choose any
other path. Without old fashioned
ideas or rules and regulations passed
down through generations of jargon,
these start-ups are lean, technologi-
cally aware and determined not to fall
into the kind of patterns that make
he Working Day famously unattrac-
tive.
So how do eminently talented grad-
uates and students make themselves
attractive to these potential employ-
ers? To be honest, it’s pretty straight-
forward: prove that you are someone
who does things. From making short
ﬁlms with your friends to setting up
a debating society, from organis-
ing a weekly music event to creating
a hangover sandwich stall – these
employers want solid evidence that
you’re as self-starting as they are.
Getting involved with the upcoming
Venture Catalyst Challenge – a com-
petition for Imperial students to turn
a great tech idea into a commercial
success - is a fantastic way to
stretch your entrepreneur-
ial wings, and it’s worth-
while checking out sites
such as enternships.
com, who specialise in
connecting talented
graduates with entre-
preneurial startups
and SME’s.
As you count down
your university days,
don’t for a second think
that the adventure has to
stop here. If you know that
you don’t belong in a cubicle,
or in a suit, feel free to
join those who feel
the same.
