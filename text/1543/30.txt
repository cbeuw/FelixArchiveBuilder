RUGBY
his season Imperial College 2nd
XV have been the most unpredict-
able team in their league. here is
no doubt that on their day they are
more threatening than a honeybadger,
but throughout the season they have
had the mercurial temperament of
a pre-pubescent teen. Flanker Vaz
Prusa is an exceptional ball-snaﬄer
and slow-witted forward Alex John-
ston has been carrying reliably. Born
and bred in the Valleys, centre Luke
James’ English has been improving all
year and now understands commands
such as ‘run’, ‘pass’ and ‘tackle’. Ladies
man Aneesh Misra claims to have
never needed any medical attention
in his life, so is dismissive of the need
for a ‘Medical School’. Having eaten
more than his fair share of turkey, the
club-supplied Weightwatchers mem-
bership has served ﬂy-half Jones well
and his eight abdominal muscles have
never been so chiseled. After wiping
the ﬂoor with the Medics last year, the
pressure is on Imperial College to re-
peat the scoreline.

he 2s have had a strong season by any
standards. Despite having a weak start
to the season which meant promotion
from our league is difficult to achieve
from now the team has built into a
very solid squad. A good fresher intake
and some commitment to training has
meant that this 2s side is the strongest
side the 2s have had in a few years.
Having not lost a game since mid
November and ﬁnding ourselves now
in the semi ﬁnal of the BUCS cup the
2s go into varsity very strongly. I have
no doubt in our ability to be able to win
varsity and that is certainly the target
we have set ourselves this season.
he season for Imperial College
3s has been chequered so far. hey
had unlucky defeats and hard fought
wins but in general the quality of
our rugby increased as we grew to-
gether as a team. Compared to pre-
vious years we have more conﬁdent
players on key positions. Who these
players are has yet to be decided as
we didn’t have the same 15 in two
consecutive games this year. Anyway
the win against St. George’s a few
weeks ago, who defeated the Medic
3rd XV recently, gives us conﬁdence
that we will walk away with a win on
the 13th.

Once again we are approaching the day
of Varsity, and the mighty 3s are more
than up for it. A lot has happened since
that day (that never happened) last year:
many new players have come in, with a
high number of ﬁrst years pulling on the
jersey. Whether among difficulties with
teams putting full squads out left us not
playing much rugby for far too long, but
we’ve come ﬂying out of the traps and
are getting back in to the swing of things
well.Afteradisappointinggamelastyear,
the boys are pumped and we’re gonna
take this to them like never before.
