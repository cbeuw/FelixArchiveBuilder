IC Judo men help ULU
to win gold in BUSA
championships
Congratulations to the Imperial
College Judo Squad for winning
three medals last weekend at the
national BUSA finals in Cannock,
Staffordshire.
We were fighting as part of
the U L U team. It was an IC final
for the under-78kg category
between Steffen Fredersdorf and
Hrvoje Jasak, with Hrvoje Jasak
taking the Gold.
Oyvinc Eikeland (under-
78kg), Christophe Carrere
(under-71kg) and Apostolis
Galantis (under-86kg) unfortu-
nately lost their repechages for
bronze medals.
The under-65kg competition
had valiant efforts from Chris
Leach , Richard Tompkins (IC)
P H O T O : CHRIS L E A C H
and Richard Webster (UCL)
against the better skilled black
belts.
On the second day, the five-
man and ten-man team events
were fought.
The five man team,
Apostolis Galantis (of UCL), and
Oyvine Eikeland, Hrvoje Jasak,
Steffen Fredersdorf and
Christophe Carrere (all IC), won
convincingly against Cambridge
in the finals, winning gold for the
first time in six years.
For the second year running
the U L U team consisted mostly
of IC players (all 5 last year and
4 out of 5 this year), which
serves as a good measure of the
quality of Judo at IC.

To Hull
And
Black
At the Annual British Univer-
sities Snooker Championships,
Imperial's A ' Team boy opened
well with a 10 - 0 thrashing of
loudly supported Loughborough,
and proceeded snugly through
the early group stage, then beat-
ing Leeds and home-team Hull
to reach the quarter finals.
There they tragically fell
foul of the luck of the Irish, in
the form of mighty Ulster who
achieved their second-best ever
result in the championships.
The 'B' team also beat
host's Hull in their early group,
with a crunch last-ball win in
their final match seeing them
through the round. They also-
succumbed to the Irish, losing to
no.l seeds Queen's in the quar-
ters, for their best ever result.
Dead In
The Water
The IC Polo-canoe team outdid
themselves this year by being
placed dead last in the recent
University of London Union
tournament (on a par with last
year's performance)
Our team; well there was
Paul who stunned the audience
with his incompetence in goal,
and Garth, who attracted all
eyes with his nude-look
swimwear. Tasmin baffled
everyone by spending half the
match upside down. ShitCliffe
lived up to his name, and Matt -
well, at least he knew the rules.
So now we look forward to
next year when we can be beat-
en again.
No Break-
through For
Virgins In
ULCup
Final
VIRGIN 0 - 20 UMDS
The scoreline does not reflect
the Virgin's domination of the
match until well into the second
half, and with Guy's up only 5-0
at half time, Imperial were still
confident that they could still
win the U L Cup.
The IC forwards outclassed
the medics, with both Adele and
Lyndsey playing exceptionally
well. Guys' advantage lay in the
alertness and speed of their half
backs, only kept at bay by the
excellent tackling of the IC
backs.
The previous Sunday saw
the Virgins take another beating,
this time at the hands of
American tourists from the
Champagne University, Illinois.
The visitors gave the Virgins an
excellent game, playing superb
technical rugby.
As ever, IC's forwards
played extremely well, though
weakness in organisation was
highlighted by impeccable ruck-
ing and mauling from the oppo-
sition. The IC backs were confi-
dent and aggressive in attack,
though this confidence was sadly
lacking in defence. In the end,
IC were well beaten by a superi-
or side.
All the Virgins would like to
wish the girls who are leaving
this year all the best for the
future; you will certainly he
missed.
