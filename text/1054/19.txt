D o you envisage spending the summer catch-
ing up on some serious work? If the answer's
no, come on tour with O p S o c . Y o u won't get
any work done but you'll have the best holi-
day ever (well the best this August anyway).
Yes, the time of year is approaching
when a large group of people descend upon
BudleighSalterton, a small seaside town i n
East D e v o n w e think (you forget so m u c h
after a fewpints of the local cider). W h i l s t in
Budleigh Salterton we aim to put on a show.
This year Susan Foister is directing The
Gondolier's with a difference!
"Venice 1958: a typical cross section of
young working-class Italians: mechanics,
office workers, shop assistants, and of course,
serving t h e burgeoning post-war tourist
industry; gondoliers. Into this bursts t h e
decadent but glamorous world of film stars,
papparazzi, minor royalty and professional
celebrities.
"Great music, a very silly plot and a
sharp suited, fast-moving, sex goddess of a
production owing more to La Dolce V i t a and
W e s t Side Story than to Richard D ' O y l y
Carte.
"What more could you want?"
The Finer Details:
•We need technicians, cast and musicians -
in fact anybody who wants to take part is wel-
come.
•We need you between 27th July and 11th
August.
The Important Bits:
C o m e along to the informal first meeting
/ sing through on Tuesday 19th M a r c h at 7.30
p m in the H u x l e y building, room 308. If you
can't gain access to H u x l e y , meet in D a
Vincis slightly earlier (by far the better plan).
If you can't make this meeting, don't worry as
the first rehearsal of next term is on Tuesday,
30th A p r i l with auditions on the 12th and
13th M a y , so there is still plenty of time to
get involved. W a t c h the O p S o c notice board
for further information.

Alcohol Awareness Week
Dependence on alcohol can be difficult to
define.How can you tell if you are?
Ask yourself these questions:

down or stop drinking?
• Have you ever found it hard to control your
drinking?
• Has your drinking ever interfered with your
work, social life or relationships with family
or friends?
• D o people ever criticise your drinking?
Does it annoy y o u if they do?
If the answer to any of the above is Y E S think
carefully before answering the following
question:
D o you drink too much? If you do, w h y not
cut downl

Game On!
N o w that I've chewed m y nails to the quick,
I am happy a n d very m u c h relieved to
announce that the Easter Carnival will be
going ahead and there will be a bar extension,
despite any rumours to the contrary.
A n d of course it's going to have been
worth every little panic attack 'cos for your
pleasure we've got entertainment from three
live bands, four discos, cabaret, a seven
colour laser, a cocktail bar, a barbecue and
three different giveaways.
The headline band is are new O n e Little
Indian signing Shaker, a band promising big
chords, surging guitars, and vocals laced with
poison. They're on a definite pop tip, a dark-
er Jamiroquai, w h o are expected to do huge
things. Support comes from a College band
called Movement w h o are quite dance orien-
tated and should have you moving your arses.
Upstairs in the concert hall the Mantra crew
are resurrected as Zenith and promise some
pounding club sounds.
Cabaret is in the Ents Lounge between
groups, and comes f r o m the m a n k n o w n as
"The Bastard Son of T o m m y Cooper". If
you've not seen his act before, either ask
someone w h o was at the B u s t - A - G u t show
andcould bear to keep watching, or imagine
the sort of thing y o u could do to yourself
with 26 inch nails and a sledgehammer. N o t
for the faint hearted, he makes T h e
Regurgitator look like your favourite uncle.
The four rooms of music throw together
all your Friday night faves; P o p Tarts i n the
Ents Lounge, the U D H will be its usual
chilled out self with a cocktail bar, the gym
falls under the spell of S e x o n T h e Beach,
with the posse on a more m e l l o w tip. Finally,
the Concert Hall, w i t h a seven-colour laser,
becomes home to H e d o n i z m - t o p bangin'
club tunes and special guests i n the shape of
A n d r e w Archer 8c Scott D a w s o n from top
remix outfit The Forth.
O n top of all this there's our usual
Barbecue, and as a special treat we've got
three lots of goodies to give-away, with T -
shirts, records, sunglasses etc for " D i e H a r d
W i t h a Vengeance", the band Whipping Boy,
" G e t Shorty" and the " A n n i e on O n e " com-
pilation.
A l l of this could be yours for just £ 5 or
£4 if you've got an Entscard, and tickets are
available now from the U n i o n Office.
