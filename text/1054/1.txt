IC Boat Club banned from race
BY DIPAK GHOSH
Imperial College Boat Club has
been banned from the Head of
the River Race on March 30th.
The ban was imposed on the
rowing club after it apparently
named an ineligible oarsman for
the race. The college rowing club
matched Cambridge University
over two set-piece rows in the
Tideway.
A spokesperson for the
organisers said "I cannot see the
possibility of Imperial College
crews competing in the event at
the moment. I feel wretched
about it." The organising commit-
tee found irregularities in the sta-
tus points of the seven college
crews and has suggested the total
withdrawal of the entry.
Steve Ellis, College's chief
coach, admitted that a mistake
had been made, but commented
that "the punishment does not fit
the crime."
Meanwhile, the College is
redesigning the boat house devel-
opment plan after the original
plans were rejected by the
Wandsworth Council planning
committee as too 'bulky'.
Another objection, that the
planned extension was too close
to nearby residential homes, has
also forced a rethink by College
planners.
The College is presently in
the process of redesigning the rel-
evant parts of the complex, pri-
marily to overcome these two
objections. Frank Murray, Sports
and Leisure Manager, told Felix
that "we are trying to redesign
the complex with minimal reduc-
tion in facilities."
He continued, "We will
meet with Wandsworth Council
in the near future to discuss our
revised plans. I am hopeful as
well as optimistic about the
chances of it being granted."

The British Association for the
Advancement of Science Youth
Section held its third annual
BAYS day exhibition at Imperial
College and the Science Museum
last Friday and Saturday.
The show is intended to
increase schoolchildren's aware-
ness of science and technology,
and the impact that it has on
their lives. It teaches them basic
principles of science through
playing with 'hands-on' exhibits.
As in previous years, there was a
wide range of exhibits on display,
from the cold and wet 'Water
Turbine' to the filthy 'Fun with
Feathers'.
Volunteers from several
organisations, including staff and
students from Imperial, gave up
their weekend to help run the
BAYS exhibition. Most of the
stalls were open between
10.15am and 3.15pm, but some
stayed open all day, resulting in
the dedicated helpers missing
lunch. Nonetheless, the organis-
ers declared the event "a suc-
cess", and said that in many ways
it was better than last year's.
This year the BAYS day
coincided with the SET96 initia-
tive, a project set up by academ-
ic and industrial research scien-
tists which sets out to educate
the general public about how
modern-day science is organised
and how research is undertaken,
as well as what is done with the
knowledge gained.
Wilson to be next Rector
Glasgow University students
have elected Richard Wilson, of
"One Foot in the Grave" fame,
as their new Rector. Any ideas
for our next Rector, anyone?
Dale Winton perhaps? page 2
Plastic cash
A pilot scheme for the electron-
ic cash system Mondex has been
mooted by College for use
around campus. The cash cards
would also be used as a swipe,
and possibly for I C U . page 2
Photographers irate
An unfortunate clash with BAYS
day led to the premature rem-
oval of the Photographic Soc-
iety's exhibition in the Consort
Gallery. They say their pictures
have been damaged page 4
