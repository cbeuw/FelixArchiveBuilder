album: bad religion - the
gray race,an
The explosion of Brit Pop has produced an end-
less number of young bands capitalising on the
current wave of happy, guitar led songs that are
anywhere from the ridiculous description of
'post-punk' to being pure pop. The young age of
many of these bands usually leads to debut
albums filled with happy, jump-a-long guitar riffs
amid the usual claims that the lyrics are supposed
to be dark and personal. On some albums, this is
refreshing. However, it tends to end up as a clum-
sy attempt to inject some sort of eloquence into
what is usually a load of mbbish. Bad Religion has
been around for a while. 'The Gray Race' does not
break any new ground musically. Typical guitar
riffs and a nice, well backed chorus is the standard
fare here. Lyrically, it is brilliant. Phrases like
'forming the fabric of a wayward people' and 'so
many righteous revolutionaries spouting Utopian
love'. 'Pity The Dead' asks the question of 'why
do we pity the dead' and proceeds to elaborate
the many negative sides of life. Although it made
me take out my dictionary (knew it'd be useful
someday), the phrases lacked the raw emotions of
the Manic Street Preachers' "The Holy Bible'.
'The Streets Of America' is probably the best
track of the album, making statements like 'hard-
cracked, daunting, lifeless veins, false hopes corri-
dors to greener pastures is all that remains'.
For all the eloquent lyrics are worth, the
music lacked the right passion. There was nothing
great about the riffs and at times, it becomes bor-
ing. Extreme is an example of a great rock/metal
band and their hugely underrated 'Three Sides To
Every Story' is one of the albums to measure any
rock album by. Every track here pales musically in
comparison to the album. Greg Graffin's lyrics
are often a joy to read in a time when lyrics do not
seem to matter anymore. It is a shame that the
music simply fails to provide an adequate canvas
for the various prose. (6)
album: mega city four -
soulscraperan
The album opens with Android Dreams' which is
a nice tune but frankly, so was Honeycrack's 'Go
Away' and so was The Longpigs' 'Far'. It's almost
impossible these days not to find a great tune. The
only question is, what is the difference? Not very
much, unfortunately. One can almost imagine
how a good tune will be like. There is nothing
wrong with the songs themselves but if a compi-
lation came out, it would be a challenge to
remember the title of the last six tracks. Although
there are loads of cool tunes around, very few will
actually blow you away. In 'Soulscraper', most
tracks do not even go that far. The music here is
so typical of almost every new band that it is not
even worth describing. The phrase 'heard it once,
heard it all' seemed to have been adopted as the
standard war chant of new pop/rock albums.
Lyrically, the album is crap. Pure and simple. At
times, it seems like a by product of teenage writ-
ing and I am surprised that they were bold enough
to actually print them out in the sleeves. Well, if
they want to print them, they have to take the
flak as well. Musically, the only moment for me
was the first track which was also their last single.
The album tends to become a chaotic mix of loud
riffs, shouts and nothing else. Don't bother with
this album. There is more than enough out there
to attract and hold your attention. (4)
