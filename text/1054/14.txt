album: various - annie on
Yes indeed, Annie Nightingale's Radio 1 compila-
tion 'Annie on One" certainly is a mixed bag,
there is a bit of everything, old and new, and its got
a really nice green cover.
First off, there's 'Them' by the Sabres of
Paradise, no need to say any more about
Weatheralls classic track, so no to 'The Age of
Love' by 'The Age of Love', again, if this 'aint one
of your top ten tunes, you might as well listen to
Bros.
The Transglobal Underground track "Lookee
here" is definitely one of the strongest tracks on
the album, and funnily enough, it's followed by
the weakest track, Kris Needs Rockerz Dub mix
of Primal Scream's 'Rocks.'
Then there's a good track from The (8)
album: lush - lovelife™
Having banished the poor management that was
partly to blame lor the lack of success of their last
album, 1994's 'Split', Lush are back with
'Lovelife' and are at last attaining mainstream
chart appeal (to some extent anyway), with the
singles 'Ladykillers' and 'Single Girl'.
The band have obviously tried to shake off
the 'ethereal' tag they have been labelled with in
the past, by removing the sound effects which
predominated on their debut 'Spooky' and leav-
ing a distinctly cleaner and therefore starker
sound to this, their third album. This might have
stretched the band's talents beyond their capabil-
ities, but fortunately they have coped exception-
ally well and whilst 'Lovelife' doesn't offer any-
thing new, it is an excellent album.
The girl's laddish reputation is reinforced on
tracks such as 'Ladykillers' (the latest single),
where Miki attacks those men who try to use the
thin pretence of having a politically correct atti-
tude towards women to their advantage when
trying to cop off - telling them 'I don't need your
practiced lines / your school of charm mentality'.
Similarity, 'Childcatcher' finds her berating those
who can't cope with women with opinions of
their own - 'You just want a daughter without the
wife / You don't need a girlfriend you need a life'.
A number of the songs are concerned with a need
to be popular, glamourous and loved.
Apart from 'Single Girl', the majority of
these are ballads, such as the excellent 'Olympia',
with emotive strings and horns being used to good
effect, producing a song that wouldn't be out of
place on a 60's film soundtrack. Only once (on
'Papasan') is both the listener's patience and the
band's vocal ability tested. Even Jarvis Cocker gets
a look in, on the duet 'Ciao', a tongue-in-cheek
look at the aftermath of a broken relationship.
Albums of this quality don't come along very
often, make sure you don't miss out. (8)

Prophecy, which is quite Rock-ey and then the
outstandingly funky 'Da funk' by Daft Punk.
T-Powers 'liberation' is awesome intelligent
jazzy jungle and Sam Sevens 'What's that sound'
is one of the biggest Brit hop tunes of the
moment. And then there's my current top tune
'Clubbed to death' - kinda classical piano meets
Brit hop-techno-chillout stuff.
Number 10 is some laid back rap from the
Black Sheep, and finally its an old indie band
Flowered up, with 'weekender' (all 12 minutes
and 56 seconds of it). Definitely a step in the right
direction for them.
There's only 11 tracks, but most of them are
quite long, so there's plenty ofmusic on here. This
one will suit everyone, all my mates like it wether
they're into indie techno or whatever. And if you
don't like it, it's still got a really nice green cover.
