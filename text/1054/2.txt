Electronic cash made for our
BY MARK BRIDGE
The college and I C U are looking
into the practicalities of introduc-
ing a combined swipe, I C U ,
library and bank linked credit
transfer card.
The smartcard technology on
which the system is based was
developed in France in the early
eighties and is now extensively
used in several European and Far
Eastern countries. Throughout
Singapore, schools and compa-
nies use the cards to pay for food
in refectories and as a means of
identification, but it has not bro-
ken into the mainstream as it has
in France, where each phonecard
has a chip built in.
Some Oxbridge colleges
already work with the system,
billing students annually for the
goods and services they purchase.
Mondex - a pioneer of the tech-
nology in this country â€” has
already started a pilot project in
Swindon, with 10,000 people
and 75% of the retailers taking
part. Credit transfer is effected
by charging the card with credit,
either by swiping through a
phone, with Mondex debiting
your account for the sum, or via
cash machines. The card also
comes with a key-ring credit
reader to keep track of card bal-
ances.
The system can be intro-
duced rapidly by printing library
bar codes and adding magnetic
stripes to the card, allowing exist-
ing- systems to be phased out
gradually.
Though free in the pilots, the
card is expected to cost users
about a pound a month to main-
tain once properly introduced.
Such costs are expected to be
met by College through savings in
cash handling (counting and
transporting monies) and by cuts
in the current cards' administra-
tion costs. The feasibility of all
this will be explored in meetings
between College, the Union, and
Mondex.
The issue was raised at the
Student Representative Council
meeting of March 12th when the
problems with the previous
attempts at introducing a com-
bined swipe-union card were dis-
cussed. The main points raised
were that students had difficulty
convincing other unions to accept
the card as a union card and that
there could be a recurrence of
the problems with voting that
occurred last year. In addition
there could be problems where
students do not have accounts
with the designated banks and
any loss of a card will entail a long
wait for a replacement and loss of
all credit on the card.
These were answered by
Matthew Crompton, Deputy
President for Finance and
Services, who said that ideas such
as having printing on both sides
with prominent I C U wording
and symbols on one side, and a
dedicated voting chip would be
explored with Mondex and
College in meetings. He went on
to explain that the possibility of
links to other cash machine sys-
tems were being explored, and
added that the loss of credit with
the cards could not be stopped
and was equivalent to anyone los-
ing cash or their wallet.
Richard Wilson pushes out Johnny
Ball to be new Rector of Glasgow
BY ROBIN RILEY
On the 24th of April, the actor
Richard Wilson will begin a three
year term of office as the new
Lord Rector of Glasgow Uni-
versity, following his election by
students last week.
Star of the BBC's "One Foot
in the Grave," M r Wilson was
elected at the third count, beat-
ing the previous Rector, lecturer
and television presenter Johnny
Ball, by 1912 votes to 1483. At
Glasgow University the rector is
largely a figure head, in a position
nominally below the Chancellor
and above the Principal in the
University's hierarchy. The
Rector has the option of chairing
the meetings of Glasgow
University Court, a student-staff
body, but Johnny Ball is the only
Rector in the last two decades to
have exercised this right.
Before the voting on
February 28th, opinion polls sug-
gested that Johnny Ball would
retain the position by a consider-
able margin. The defeat came as a
shock to M r Ball who, far from
his usual effervescent self, was
quoted shortly afterwards as say-
ing "I am not some bleeding
actor... I've been the most effec-
tive Rector in 540 years. I have
worked and worked, and I am sad
not to be given a chance to carry
on. I am bitterly disappointed.
Gutted." He also expressed con-
cerns regarding the overt left-
wing political affiliation of
Richard Wilson, whose campaign
was organised by Glasgow Uni-
versity's Labour club.
Meanwhile, the jubilant M r
Wilson was bubbling between
swigs from a celebratory bottle of
champagne, most unlike his
Victor Meldrew alter-ego:
"Although I said I was quietly
confident of winning, I wasn't
really. I am absolutely delighted."
The other two other candi-
dates congratulated M r Wilson
on the result. Dorothy Grace-
Elder, a journalist and Scottish
National Party affiliate, came
third with 446 votes while
Professor Al-Mass'ari, a Saudi
dissident seeking asylum in the
U K came last, gaining a
respectable 280 votes with his
high-profile "Mass'ari Must Stay"
campaign.
In spite of a pre-election poll
which revealed that only 19% of
Glasgow students could name all
four candidates, the overall
turnout for the Rectorial elec-
tions was a huge 52%. However,
the turnout for Glasgow's sabbat-
ical elections, held last Monday,
was only 6.8%, putting Imperial's
supposedly apathetic 8% turnout
in a more favourable light.
It would seem that the elec-
tion of a celebrity figurehead
doesn't encourage students to
take any deeper interest in the
affairs of their University.
