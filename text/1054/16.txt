video: die hard iii.spooky "
John McClane is having another bad day. This
time round, the brother of the villain from Die
Hard is threatening to set off bombs in public
places around New York City unless McClane
(Bruce Willis) completes a variety of tasks and
puzzles. Samuel L. Jackson plays Zeus, a shop-
keeper reluctantly forced to accompany
McClane on his chase around New York.
Although the initial plot seems quite
promising, the script quickly runs out of ideas
and reverts to a secondary plot about a gold heist.
Neither plot seems quite compatible with the
other, and neither are developed sufficiently to
sustain the movie. By maintaining exactly the
same pace all the way through, the director has
given very little sense of a beginning, middle, or
end - in fact, the film seems to end twice.
The Willis-Jackson partnership provides
some witty repartee, but the humour revolves
around a single joke which wears thin over the
course of the film. Willis has perfected his John
McClane, doing the whole film as if he really
does have a bad hangover. Jeremy Irons is suit-
ably nasty as the villain but, probably through a
lack of screen time (he doesn't actually appear
until the half-way mark), doesn't make as much
impact as Alan Rickman did in the first film.
Because the action is not confined to one
location, die film lacks the sense of claustropho-
bia which permeated its predecessors. Unlike
the first two, McClane is not alone; not only has
he been given a partner, but he also has the entire
NYPD as support. Last of all, the sense has gone
that McClane is an accidental hero; no longer is
he simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Because of these differences, this is less a
Die Hard film and more a buddy-buddy cop
movie, and the film consequently sacrifices a lot
of originality already. To be fair, it is at least dif-
ferent from its predecessors but what it has
become has already been much better done -
witness the Lethal Weapon series, or Bad Boys.
All in all, besides the fact that the protago-
nist is called McClane and over the course of the
film he gets increasingly beaten-up, there is very
little to distinguish this as a Die Hard film.
Although the New York setting could theoreti-
cally have provided many plot devices, the sheer
range of options means that the scriptwriters
haven't had to be as inventive, and the lack of
original ideas shows.
Therefore, With A Vengeance is a poor third
installment to the Die Hard trilogy, suffering
mainly from a lack of identity. If it had borne
closer resemblance to its predecessors (despite
having the same director as the first) then it
would quite probably have been a worthy third
film, but as it is, it comes across like McClane's
hangover.
