slowburn: blissed out beats
and after hours anthems,,,.,
Obviously someone has been going around telling
the man that there is a hungry audience for this
sort of thing. It never rains but it pours as they say,
and this is a veritable storm of different styles,
quality and remixes.
The opening track for once is not the best
track on the compilation, in lact it is a rather tired
sounding, slightly dubby track by the Leftfield
produced Sandals. It has also been remixed by the
said producers who have thankfully cut out any of
the original vocals and really done their best to
make this the after hours anthem alluded to in the
title.
Cocteau Twins are next with one of their
"impossible to comprehend lyrics" tracks which
usually annoy but this one is really quite pretty.
Then there is Audio Deluxe with a very jolly, sum-
mery piece. Some people could even be excused
for describing the tinkling bells whichranalong in
the background throughout as being quite blissful.
This is followed by Warp 69's mellow, shuffly
jazz sound, remixed to an unknown extent by
Global Communications. And talking of the
Aphex Twin we come to possibly the best track
on this tape which is Mr James' remixed to fuck
version of St Etienne's "Who do you think you
are". Lots of scratchy bass and the merest snippets
of sampled vocals. Very nice.
We get a predictable Oakenfold remix of
Izit's "Stories", a track by some people called
Innocence and then there is the interesting com-
bination of an L.F.O. remix Art of Noise
"Crusoe". Still recognisable, with a gentie break-
beat. Yep, quite probably an anthem by now, in
one form or another. The Ballistic Brothers (vs.
Accentric Alios) keep on with the jazzy, break-
beat sound though by the end of it you are ready
for something a bit different... Probably not
Electra though, who finish off this compilation on
a rather normal note.
So, full marks for ecleticism but as always this
means everybody has to put up with something
they don't like. (7)

They are are cut above the indie gmnge lata'l
that's been pinned on tltrtn over the years. Tlteir
music oozes a quality sadly lacking in most odier
hands struggling to till die post-Nirvana void The
ful! emotional weight of this album doesn't really
tut you until something tike the tenth listen, and
even then it keeps corning. The wailing is worth
