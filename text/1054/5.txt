Third party liability?
Crunch! The results of the collision outside Physics last week.
BY TIM ST.CLAIR
In light of BMW's takeover of
Rover a few years back, the acci-
dent which occurred outside the
Blackett Laboratory in Prince
Consort Road last Thursday was
somewhat ironic.
A motorist driving a B M W
apparently took the left turn off
Queensgate a little too fast, los-
ing control of his vehicle and
skidding through 180 degrees
before colliding rear-end first
with a Rover which was parked
outside the Physics building. The
force of the impact was great
enough to cause the Rover to
completely mount the kerb, leav-
ing it 'beached' across the pave-
ment, the near corner of its rear
bumper just touching the wall of
the building.
The police were on the
scene within minutes but the dri-
ver of the B M W had already
departed, prompting speculation
that the car had been stolen.
The Rover suffered surpris-
ingly little visible damage in the
crash, having only its front near-
side light fittings cracked. The
B M W fared somewhat worse; its
entire boot volume was caved in
and crumpled. (Could this be
proof of superior British crafts-
manship?)
Below is a diagram of the
accident scene, as prepared by
our 'on-the-spot' reporter. It
shows the tyre marks left by the
B M W and the final positions of
the two vehicles.
