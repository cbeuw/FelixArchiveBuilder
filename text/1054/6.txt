NEWS REVIEW
News Review of Spring 1996:
BY ANDY SINHARAY

December's Tory budget cuts of
£2m were followed by madness
of a different kind, though this
time the news was better.
Following new research, scien-
tists at St Mary's were hopeful
that mad cow disease (BSE)
couldn't cross the species barri-
er' into humans. Progress on the
BMS building appeared to have
stalled, still awaiting permission.
The RCS II building continued to
?
ill8lillE
stand defiantly in the way ol the
new BMS block, with College's
position on the issue unclear.
Clarity was also absent in
Time Out magazine, already hav-
ing shot uncomfortably to lame
over IC's alleged drink-problem,
were now making allegations ol
nuclear waste emissions from the
Biology department in Beit.
Again, the college position was
unclear.
Any clarity that then' may
may been in Da Vinci's was to be
removed, alter its free newspaper
service was withdrawn. " A
minority continue to abuse it,
stealing papers, tearing them up
and generally trashing them," the
bar staff complaineil.

More theft, tearing up and
trashing seemed to be in the
offing... Progress on the B M S
building appeared to have
stalled (again): the medics con-
tinued to campaign for more
social space in the new building,
at one stage even suggesting
that I C U make representations
to the local council, to try to
block the B M S planning bid.
The R C S U had also been
somewhat vexed by the BMS,
worried about their proposed
move to Civil Engineering, hav-
ing already been shunted out of
old Chemistry into Biology.
Their president, M o Dulloo,
said, "we'll move again, but my
concern is that we have a work-
ing office," annoyed at IC's
apparent predilection with blue
signage rather than student
needs.
Theft manifested itself in
the form of computers disap-
pearing from Mech Eng
Computer centre, student prop-
erty disappering from halls and
money disappearing from uni-
versities nationwide, due to the
round of government cuts.
Emily Baldock, Durham S U
president, was called for a day
of student action to oppose any
introduction of top-up fees. At
a staff level, the cuts were akin
to the closure of 7 universities
or the loss of 6500 lecturers'
jobs, according to the, A U T .
Pushing for pay increases, "If
this...is not forthcoming then
we will not take it lying down,"
said Tom Wilson, their General
Secretary. They weren't alone:
Similarly skint was I C Rag, hav-
ing earned less than a fifth of
last year's total.
Felix 1047
In an attempt to get things
straight, or at least less twisted
than before, the Medics claim
that they'd be unfairly represent-
ed in the last issue; the BMS
action group had decided to not
attempt to block the application,
but instead called for a cross-
campus discussion of student
facilities. They insisted that pro-
posed social space for the build-
ing had been more than halved,
not merely reduced by around a
quarter, as suggested by the
estates department. Discussions
then took place about student
social space, with which Sarah
White said she was "very
pleased." Meanwhile, progress on
the building appeared to have
stalled (once more) as the plan-
ning application failed to be con-
sidered anyway. The BMS, not
merely content with harassing
the RCSU, broadened their hori-
zons by giving the C & G C U has-
sle with their hovercraft.
Smiles were also in evidence
as it seemed likely that IC, with
its links with industry, could ben-
efit from a new funding formula,
though other universities would-
n't been quite as lucky. The
Aldwych Group, also concerned
with the state of university fund-
ing, sent an open letter to the
C V C P stressing its opposition to
the introduction of top-up fees.
Oddly, the usually vociferous
N U S was quiet on the matter.
The I C U front doormat, whose
theft last term had flung I C U
(and certainly Sarah White) into
an uncomfortable spotlight, as
well as a security photo, had
reappeared in Royal Holloway
College Union.
Felix 1048
The Government, unusually in
agreement with I C U , opposed
top-up fees; the C V C P wanted
to claw back its losses some-
how; H E F C E said that universi-
ties could admit fewer students
if they needed to. Ideas mooted
by the C V C P included the
introduction of a one-off sign-
ing on fee, or an annual top-up
fee proper. Many were unim-
pressed, Professor Alan
Swanson telling the Academic
Affairs Half Day that having to
make such decisions amounted
to the Government "getting
other people to do their dirty
work."
Progress on the B M S build-
ing appeared to... well, guess.
O n a more regional scale, more
cuts were sustained when it was
announced that Fire Service
cover for South Ken was being
reduced. College's signage
predilection took a new twist
when a newly installed placard
on the walkway announced the
arrival of the Royal Shakespeare
Company, while the Saga O f
The Rug continued after Sarah
White and Matt Crompton
phoned R H C U to retreive the
errant carpet only to hear that it
had vanished again. Sarah was
said to unimpressed with their
attitude, saying it was irrespon-
sible to leave a £250 item just
lying around outside an office.
As opposed to leaving it just
lying around outside a Union
lobby, perhaps...?
Felix 1049
As if the Government couldn't
worsen H E funding, a Tory think-
tank proposed to do just that,
this time targeting student
finance. They suggested the abo-
lition of government grants in
order to partly compensate for
