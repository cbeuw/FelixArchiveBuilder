play - dead awakenuioia
Describing this production, the word
'surreal' springs to mind immediately,
closely followed by 'fresh', 'innovative'
and 'entertaining'; Ibsen is well known
for his often very strange style. The
London-Irish playwright, innovator and
founder of the Praxis theatre laboratory
Sam Dowling has successfully liberated
this play from time and place to make it
tmly universal.
In the intimate surroundings of the
North Pole Theatre in Greenwich - pos-
sibly the smallest acting space I've ever
seen - the audience cannot help but feel
involved, especially since the set is con-
tinually being painted during the perfor-
mance.
Right from the start a barrage of
complex ideas is fired from the
Norwegian playwright's mind as Rubeck,
an artist, faces crisis in his failing marriage
and the return of his former lover and
model Irene. His wife, Nadia, is drawn
into the arms of the bear-hunter while
the constant presence of the shadow - a
silent woman dressed in strange black garb is dis-
tinctly unnerving.
Dead Awaken is often described as a prob-
lem play because if a cast tries too hard to under-
stand its deeper meaning they limit themselves
to portraying only their interpretation. This com-
pany, however, work without a director and are
continually changing and improving the perfor-
mance, leaving it up to the audience to figure it
out. The play is about an hour long, which is
about as much as the average sane person can
absorb, and provides plenty of time to sample
the wares of the bar downstairs and argue over
why on earth there was a tin bath in the centre
of the stage.
In his first article for a fortnightly review in
1900, a young James Joyce described the play as
Ibsen's best, but it's not often seen. Discover art,
life, idealism, young love, bitterness and the
meaning of life - it's all there.
play - serving it u
p
,
™
Set in an urban wasteland somewhere in the East
End of London, David Eldridge's play 'Serving It
Up' is an in-yer-face tragicomedy dripping hilar-
ity and pathos in equal proportions. Sharp social
caricatures
are depicted
where the
slags, the
(new] lads
and the par-
ents melt into
one dystopian
and dysfunc-
tional mess.
Smart, street-
wise banter
r i c o c h e t s
around the
confines of
this compact
theatre; the
dialogue occa-
sionally scratching the surface of some deeper
realities.
Essentially it is a story about the boredom
andfrustrationof the underclass; the disaffected,
the disenchanted and the disillusioned. Their
escape comes in many forms. Val, the bored
mother, has an affair with the best friend of her
son, while Sonny (funnily enough the son) spirals
out ol control through anger and violence. He
develops an overt nationalistic pride - which
e m b o d i e s
itself in some
r a m p a n t
racism. The
acting is top
notch; the cast
filling out their
limited roles
to the fullest
extent possi-
ble, though
admittedly
none had any
real presence.
The set was
one of mini-
malist realism:
concrete and
steel bars, while the occasional snatches of music
were interlinked with the script and varied from
The Who to Supergrass. This is emotionally
exciting fringe at its best.
