Photographic exhibition cut short
BY RACHEL WALTERS
The IC Photographic Society
have complained that pictures
displayed in the Consort gallery
have been damaged by college
technical staff, who took them
down because the room had been
double-booked. The exhibition
had to be taken down premature-
ly, after it was discovered at the
last minute that it clashed with
plans for the BAYS events of last
week.
The organisers of the display
were given less than 24 hours'
notice that their exhibition,
which had been booked until the
end of term, had to be removed.
As members of the society were
unavailable, IC staff removed the
photographs themselves early on
Thursday morning. The photo-
graphic society chairman, Neil
Chadbornc, told Felix that the
pictures had been stacked up in
two large piles in a cupboard:
"one frame has a large chip miss-
ing and I'm sure the photos at the
bottom of the pile must be dam-
aged because of the weight."
He was also upset that the
display had been taken down
before the end of term. The soci-
ety had booked a professional
photographer to come and view
the exhibition on Thursday
evening.
Anne Kemp, the conference
centre manager, said that the
double-booking was an 'unfortu-
nate' consequence of a 'break-
down in communication'. "I feel
we've let them down badly
because we didn't know about
it," she said. She explained that
rooms are not 'booked off on
their computer system if the
event is an exhibition which will
enable the rest of the room to be
used. The organisers of the BAYS
exhibition needed to put posters
on the walls as well as using the
room itself.
Ms Kemp insisted that it was
the first time that there had been
a problem with double-booking
events. "Things like this have to
happen so we can learn and make
improvements for the future,"
she said. She expressed surprise
that the students had complained
that pictures had been damaged.
Defending the conference centre
technician who supervised the
exhibition's removal, himself a
nart enthusiast, she insisted that
"you could not beat Ned for per-
fection." P H O T O : NEIL C H A D B O R N E
RCS Union elections score poorly
BY MARK BRIDGE
Unbeknownst to many, the Royal
College of Science Union elec-
tions took place last Wednesday
with one of the smallest turnouts
for years.
The RCSU held a bar-night-
cum-hustings in the traditional
bar the evening before the elec-
tions, with a promising atten-
dance by current students, but
this failed to translate into a high
turnout on polling day. The num-
ber of people voting was even
lower than that for the City and
Guilds Union elections a few
weeks previously, confirming
allegations that students are suf-
fering from 'ballot fatigue'.
Mo Dulloo and Chris Bragg,
current incumbents of R C S U
posts, both won another year in
their offices of President and
Honourary Junior Treasurer
{HIT}. Karl Condron will be the
new Vice-President, Rob Park
will be Honourary Secretary, and
Samantha Baker the new
Academic Affairs Officer.
Concerns were expressed in
the preamble to the elections
after confusion about nominees
and a very poor turnout at the
original hustings on the 5th of
March. Further problems arose
when some candidates' names
were put on nomination papers
without their knowledge. The
elections themselves then had to
be postponed when candidates
manifestoes didn't appear in the
R C S U publication Broadsheet in
time. Voting had originally been
planned for Monday and
Tuesday, but in fact ballot boxes
were only open for a single day
last Wednesday.
The office of the presidency
was initially contested, but when
Mo's intention to re-stand
became apparent the others
withdrew in his favour, one opt-
ing to run for V P instead. Seven
candidates stood for the posts in
the end, but three of the five
offices were uncontested. The
number of people voting reached
about 150 which corresponds to
around 6% of the electorate.
The presidential incumbent,
Mo Dulloo, re-stood pledging to
"...get rid of the insular nature"
of the organisation and to lay the
foundations for a strengthened
Union which could stand on a par
with the Medics in 1998.
Chris Bragg, HJT, promised
more active, powerful lobbying
for Imperial College Union
funds, and Rob Park has said that
he wants to expand the role of his
office beyond it's current remit.
He plans to oversee and coordi-
nate the Constituent College
Union's internal affairs to facili-
tating more student involvement
and lobbying to create more
R C S U clubs and societies.
Karl Condron aims to resur-
rect student interest in mascotry
as Vice President, and Samantha
Baker will work to improve com-
munication at the student-acade-
mic representative level and
ensure that R C S U students are
not 'sidelined' with the arrival of
St Mary's on the South
Kensington campus in 1998.
