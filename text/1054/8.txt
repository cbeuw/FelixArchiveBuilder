A C e n t u of o g r e s s ?
Last Easter, Felix interviewed Mr Reginald Pink on the occasion of his 100th
birthday. Just before his 101st birthday, Mr Pink passed away.
His great-granddaughter looks back upon the past 100 years and considers
the changing world that we have created.
The name Reginald Pink will never be
found in the history books, although he
played a very important part in the his-
tory of the world. He left the world
almost as anonymously as when he
entered it in 1895. Having fought in
India in the First World War, he was
the last surviving member of his regi-
ment. He was too old to fight in the
Second World War, but worked on the
railways. He spent over 40 years of his
life a widower. Last week, just before
his 101st birthday, my Great
Grandfather (or G G D , as I called him)
decided that he'd had enough, and that
it was time to leave the world.
The world he left behind, though, was
very different from the one into which he
was born. After all, we are talking here about
a man who could remember hearing the news
of Queen Victoria's death; a man who was
already retired when the Berlin Wall went
up; a man who was a grandfather when the
Beatles were founded! He lived to experience
the reigns of six monarchs and twenty Prime
Ministers.
Technologically, the world has advanced
beyond all recognition in the past century. In
1895, the concept of television would have
seemed totally ludicrous. The idea of man
walking on the moon would have been
reserved for childhood fantasies. Finger-
printing had not been invented, let alone

Fashions are different - I was often accused
by him of 'looking like a boy' because my
attire was not considered feminine enough.
People are no longer punished for writing

bles developing in
South Africa - the
Boer War was raging
throughout his childhood.
He saw a black President
take control. Ireland was
only one, undivided coun-
try, and Sinn Fein did not
exist. There was still as
death penalty, and divorce
was only legal on grounds
of adultery. There was no
Labour Party, there were
no Boy scouts. The
Kaisers still ruled in
Germany, and the
Czars in Russia.
G G D saw the world almost destroy
itself in two world wars. He believed that
WWI was 'the war to end all wars', but
humanity created bigger and more destruc-
tive weapons, and went to
war again. He would never
have believed he would see
such full-scale mass
destruction as that created
by the dropping of Atomic
bombs on Hiroshima and
Nagasaki. How much dev-
astation could we have
caused if the Cold War had developed into a
Third World War?
As G G D is laid to rest, I cannot help but
wonder how the world will look in another
hundred years' time. Can we continue to
develop at the speed we currently are, with-
out totally destroying ourselves? I don't want
to see us go back to a time when children
were sent down mines, when women had no
rights, when watching hangings was a child-
hood treat. I dread to think what
would be like if Hitler had been
allowed to rampage his way across
Europe unstopped and unhindered.
But I would like to see a
world where it is safe for
children to play outside
in the streets;
where there is
less pollution;
where materialism and
consumerism play a less
important role in soci-
ety; where poorer coun-
tries are not exploited by
larger ones; where chil-
dren are able to enjoy
themselves without the
need for expensive toys,
computers and televi-
sion.
Genetic engineering
has achieved some
amazing things, but
where does it go from here? Will we soon
really see a world similar to that in Huxley's
"Brave New World" - written as a warning
against such things happening, but looking
increasingly likely to become, at least in part,
reality?
G G D ' s own words about the world as it
is today were: "It's all wrong! We're doing
everything too fast!"
He put it somewhat more bluntly than
Aldous Huxley, but the point is the same.
Are we really making the world a better
place? How will we progress further? Will the
world as we know it still exist in another hun-
dred year's time?
G G D knew what he thought - and he
should know, he saw a lot of it happen.
