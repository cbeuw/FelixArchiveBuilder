1996 British Computer Society pro-
gramming Competition
The regional heats of the annual BCS
Programming Competition took place on
25th February. Five teams from Imperial
College took part in the South East Regional
heat at the British Aerospace centre in
Farnborough. The teams were made up of
five people and the competition involved
solving several programming problems within
the short time period of four hours using a
single PC.
The all-2nd year team Moccasin, made
up of John Scott (Team Manager), Phillip
Pearson, Leon Brocard, Alex Yip and Xiang
Feng, finished third in the heat and is
through to the final, defying most people's
expectations. The second IC team through is
Turquoise who finished 5th in the heat.
The final will be held on 23rd March at
Preston.

Tropical Dub
Storm
On March 1st, Flor Del Bosque, an environ-
mental group dedicated to global forest pro-
tection whose key members work in the
Biology department, called upon The Mighty
Jah to unleash a vast storm in Central
London. Four hundred disciples followed the
paths of environmental enlightenment and
converged upon the School of Oriental and
African Studies to witness the sermon of
Aba-Shanti-I, whereupon the Bass Guru let
rip the full power of the sounds of Jah, light-
ening and thunder until the early hours.
The whole spectacle was well keyed up
with Shanti-I's 10K rig: a bass machine so
potent it is more suited as a weapon of awe-
some destruction in a Bond film. People
danced themselves into a carnal fever fuelled
by mesmeric dub and Red Stripe. In addition
to this aural orgy, Flor Del Bosque provided
full visual effects centred upon high profile
projects based in South American rain-
forests. By the last half hour internal organs
had been reduced to pulp and the building's
foundations were in danger of collapsing,
besides, the bar had been reduced to selling
the last few cans of warm cider.
Long range weather forecasts predict
another dub storm at the same.venue on May
3rd when Flor Del Basque and House of
Roots in collaboration with SOAS Union call
upon Aba-Shanti-I to unleash Tropical Dub
Storm Chapter Two. Further info from:
