A telescope on the web
Sabine Louet
W
e live in the age of the Hubble Space
Telescope, of orbiting observatories
and Very Large Arrays. The cost of
stargazing is truly astronomical. But a British
group has set up a telescope that brings these big
boys' toys within everyone's reach.
The Bradford Robotic Telescope is a mod-
em 46cm telescope sitting on a hilltop in the
Yorkshire Dales. It can be accessed through the
world wide web, making it available to millions
of people. What makes this telescope unusual is
that it does everything itself. It checks that it is
not raining or cloudy. It checks that nobody is
snooping around the site and most important of
all, it knows when it gets dark!
The telescope is a prototype built by the
Engineering In Astronomy (EIA) group within
the University of Bradford's Department of
Industrial Technology. "The site is designed to be
used by lots of different people", says Dr John
Baruch, of the EIA group. The group hope to
make access to the telescope as open as possible.
They are already working with a number of
schools who can use the telescope as a learning
aid. Ultimately, they would like to see a network
with telescopes in Tenerife, Japan and Australia.
and a car that tells you
where to go...

T
he Cybergeneration is about to bring
advanced technology to driving. In
Britain, two hardware companies, Bosch
and Philips, will launch versions of a computer
guidance system this summer. Meanwhile,
Psychologist Paul Jackson, of the University of
London Centre for Transport Studies has been
examining individual responses to guidance in
order to improve existing devices.
In the British system directions are stored
on a simple C D Rom containing maps of every
big city in the country. The on-
board computer tells you where
you are and asks you where you X I
want to go. Simultaneously, the 28 orbiting
US military satellites constantly update and
pinpoint your position on the computer
map. The system then guides you directly to
your final destination, saving you time and
petrol. In order to focus the driver's atten-
tion on the road and not the screen, an elec-
tronic voice gives the directions.
Aiming a guidance message at the dri-
ver requires more than advanced technolo-
gy, it also needs an understanding of individ-
ual responses to information. Paul Jackson
concentrated his research on the way people
react, depending on their age, gender and
driving ability. Contrary to popular beliefs, gen-
der is not important. Neither sex showed a bet-
ter ability to find their bearings. Surprisingly,
when it comes to navigation, age counts for more
than experience. Young women drivers fare bet-
ter than older, yet more experienced, male dri-
vers.
Research is now focussing on whether cer-
tain messages have more impact on us than oth-
ers. For instance, the order of presentation
changes people's response to the guidance sys-
tem. Hence if the voice tells you "at the garage,
turn right", it might prove more efficient than
"turn right at the garage".
Using the telescope is free, once on-line you
just have to spend two minutes registering with
the computer to get a password. You can then
tell the telescope what you want to look at, and
sit back and wait lor the results. It automatically
stores each request, and when conditions are
good, it carries out as many observations as it can.
When it has taken the picture you asked for, it
sends you an E-mail message inviting you to look
at the results. In good weather, this could be the
next morning.
With the less than perfect Yorkshire weath-
er, there is often only a short time each night for
observations. Nevertheless, the reward for per-
severance can be some spectacular images.
Indeed, on a recent visit with a BBC film crew,
Sir Patrick Moore was moved to say, "It was just
what I expected, only 50 times better."
The site is fairly unique on the Internet. "It
is the only one with an autonomous robot and
the only one where you can request astronomi-
cal observations," says Dr Baruch.
If you have access to the world wide web
you can find the telescope at http://www.tele-
scope.org - and be that rare breed of astronomer,
one with their nights free for other pursuits.
