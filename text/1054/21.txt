LETTERS T O FELIX: E D I T E D BY A L E X F E A K E S
Dear Rachel,
Congratulations to your
team on producing the elections
special so speedily. I'd just like to
point out that my comment -
"those Mary's votes didn't make
the difference at all" was said
tongue in cheek.
However, I'll stand by what I
said. The results would not have
been affected i i no-one at Mary's
had voted: mainland IC voting
gave the four victors convincing
wins, even in the well contested
posts. Only for Felix, where the
block vote weakened a little, did
Mary's fail to confirm the freely
made choices. A win's a win - it's
not the size that counts.
Though entertaining in parts
(whilst being generally insulting
and immature) the hustings at
Mary's needn't have been treated
like a victory parade. As far as
block voting goes I'm all in favour
so long as all the candidates are
considered. If groups of people
make the effort to calculate
what's best for them why should-
n't they promote their candi-
dates? And if anyone can drum
up enough enthusiasm to get
more than half of their colleagues
to vote then that has to be better
than the feeble turnout in my
own department.
The turnout of 11 % was dis-
appointing. If 89% of us have no
interest (or at least don't have a
say) in who is: representing us in
IC and beyond, keeping an eye on
union services and budgets, look-
ing after the interests of the enor-
mous range of clubs and societies,
or producing our weekly news-
sheet, then that's a great shame.
Well done to those who had the
courage to stand for the elec-
tions.
Oily Newman, Elections
Committee, Civ Eng dep rep.
Dear Felix,
On behalf of ConSoc I am
writing to express my thanks to
I C U for providing the necessary
funding for Daniel Neiss, one of
our members, to attend a 7-day
conference in Oxford at the end
of this term. The conference,
which will focus on the current
and future role of the EC, will be
an excellent opportunity for dis-
cussion of real and highly relevant
issues. The findings of this meet-
ing will be presented to the E C
commission at a future date.
Jamie Oliver, ConSoc Press
Officer.
Union money used for political
ends? N o , just joking. Good
luck, Daniel, and let's just hope
that you all reach a consensus
for once, eh?
Dear Felix,
I'd like to say congratulations
on a well-written piece concern-
ing the International Night in last
week's issue. Regrettably, howev-
er, I must say I was somewhat
annoyed by an error in the article
in which I was misquoted as say-
ing 'there were a few more mis-
takes last year.' Despite the fact
that I was not involved with the
Overseas Students' Committee
last year (and therefore could not
make a comment regarding last
year's event) and that M r Riley,
the journalist who penned the
article, did not interview me him-
self - I fail to see how an irre-
sponsible remark like that could
have to made it to the piece. I
realise that occasional misprints
do occur, but let's not keep them
too occasional, shall we?
G Tan (OSC Honorary
Junior Treasurer).
As far as I can gather, your
quote was passed on to Robin by
someone who had spoken to
you. In any case, it only served to
underline the ever improving
success of International Night.
