the HEFCE cuts, with a view to
funding by the private sector.
The C V C P met in London to dis-
cuss introducing a one-off "gov-
ernment deficit levy" of £350 -
otherwise known as a top-up fee.
However, one university head
said this was inadequate, citing
£1000 as more realistic figure.
But according to IC's Rector,
there was "no intention of charg-
ing... it would achieve almost
nothing for the college." Jonathan
Aitken M P dropped by Consoc,
outlining Britian's position in the
New World Order, while a pair
of drunk miners dropped in
through the ceiling of the I C U
Print Unit, claiming they were
lost. Also directionless were
ICU's sabb elections, which had
not so much started slowly as
barely started at all, with only
two candidates declaring them-
selves...

In the wake of the Docklands
Bomb, Sir Patrick Mayhew vis-
ited ConSoc, saying that the
IRA would have to call the
ceasefire again before the peace
process could begin. At the
other end of the political spec-
trum, the ex-Labour leader
Michael Foot visited, giving a
lecture on the far less con-
tentious issue of one of IC's
more famous alumni, H . G .
Wells. A more right-wing
iTories
Labour politician dropped in a
I C U (though not through the
roof this time) when U L U
President Ghassan Karian visit-
ed I C U council to describe the
new shape of the U L U
Consitution, especially with
regard to medical school repre-
sentation.
More budding politicians
signed up as the Sabb elections
gathered speed, or at least lost
slowness. Although contests for
two of the four posts appeared
to have become one-horse races,
there were now two candidates
for the post of D P f C & S ) and
three for the presidency. Many
candidates lacked a full compli-
ment of seconders. However,
many lamented the lack of
interest shown in the whole
event: "It looks like it's all
going to be very boring this
year," muttered Tim Townend,
D P ( C & S ) .

Progress on the BMS Building - al
together now - appeared to have
stalled. The Borough Council
should have viewed the applica-
tion, though it had now been put
off for another two weeks, so as
to allow English Heritage to put
forward their views. This was the
third time that the application
had failed to even be considered,
let alone approved. It was a tough
week for the union: I C U could
soon be denied bar extensions
from the local constabulary, pos-
sibly due to police changes in
staffing commitments.
I C U was also temporarily
denied its clock after one of its
hands became "mis-aligned", and
it was further denied £1000 of
disco equipment. To further
complicate matters, it would
soon be denied some 28% of its
budget. The sabb elections,
increasingly derided as lacklustre,
at least seemed to gather more
momentum as the chase for
DP(C&S) became 3-horse race,
and everyone gradually became
fully seconded. Elsewhere, the
C & G elections weren't doing
quite so well...

Jokes, bad singing and wide-
spread downing of pints. A
C C U barnight? No: election
hustings (differing from the for-
mer in that fewer serious issues
were raised). Although there
was much amusement at both
the I C U ents-lounge event and
its blockbusting, flan-throwing
sequel at Mary's, few serious
issues were discussed. College
were still in the dark over
English Heritage's decision for
the long suffering yet paradoxi-
cally as-yet-unbuilt B M S
building. Also in the dark were
medics over their proposed syl-
labus, due to be implemented in
1998. A worrying increase in
bike thefts prompted sugges-
tions of a 'Big Brother'
approach to security - C C T V
may end up being installed out-
side the college library.

Election Results! The votes,
counted in record time, elected
Alex Feakes as Felix Editor,
Sarah Corneille as DP(C&S),
Piers Williams as DP(F&S) and
Eric Allsop as President. Yet for
all the cheers in the bar, the
interviews, the photos, the inter-
views, the tears, the interviews
and the alcohol, did the average
student really care...?
Felix 1053
...After all, less than 900 votes
were cast, with only 8% of the
South Ken students voting.
Unlike last year, the Mary's
medics didn't seem as united as
usual in their block vote...
Turnouts were, better at the
OSC's International Night, suc-
cessful as ever. The B M S was
finally put out of its misery as
English Heritage finally gave it
the go-ahead: "It's full steam
ahead from here," said Estates
Director Ian Caldwell, for pos-
sibly the nth time. Against a
backdrop of new sabbaticals
appearing, one of the current
incumbents vanished for the
day: Sarah White, apparently
kidnapped in a Rag stunt. Also
experiencing misery was IC's
H E F C E grant, facing a 3.7%
cut.
