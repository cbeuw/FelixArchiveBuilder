Preparations lor the gradual
demolition of the RCS II build-
ing are currently underway after
planning permission for the new
biomedical sciences building was
granted earlier this month.
Kensington and Chelsea
Borough Planning Council passed
the plans and approved the
demolition of RCS II subject to
the design being brought up to
English Heritage's standards.
Amendments to the building's
blueprints are now being made in
the light of the recommenda-
tions.
Alterations to the proposed
design include cosmetic changes
to the tower, which was to be
clad in a textured stone. English
Heritage recommended that
smooth stone be used instead,
harmonising the frontage with
the appearance of the Queen's
Tower. English Heritage also rec-
ommended that the site could be
better landscaped to fit in with
the current surroundings. These
two recommendations are con-
sidered as fairly minor and little
difficulty is anticipated in their
implementation.
A more demanding job will
be the redesign of the plant room
on the roof ol the BMS building.
In the present plans, this extends
forward, projecting over the top
of the building, and English
Heritage has recommended that
this be redesigned so that it will
not stick out. New designs are
anticipated to take three weeks
to produce.
While Norman Foster adjust
the designs, demolition of the
RCS II building proceeds apace.
The building will be dismantled
rather than demolished, due to
its proximity to the science
museum and chemistry build-
ings. Scaffolding was erected
around the RCS II building last
Wednesday and the disassembly
has already begun. While the
RCS II building is taken down,
the BMS groundwork will be laid
where possible; this move has
been taken to catch up on lost
time, estimated to be several
weeks. Imperial College Estates
Director Ian Caldwell predicted
that "this won't be last of our
problems, so we want to regain
lost time while we can."
Mr Caldwell said that the
biggest concern now about the
project is what impact the noise
of construction may have on stu-
dents doing exams. Estates staff
are presently looking at ways to
make sure that disturbance is
kept to a minimum for the dura-
tion of the examination period.
As a priority, exams planned to
be held in the nearest corner of
the Civil Engineering building
will be moved elsewhere while
the work takes place.

Pot stashed
The Three-Handled Pot of the
Royal College of Science Union
was stolen from the Union bar
during the R C S U Election
barnight last Tuesday. The bar
was packed with students from
all the CCUs, and at around ten
o'clock R C S U officers noticed
that the prized possession was
nowhere to be seen.
Colloquially known as the
3HP, the pot is a one-off design
and the R C S U has requested its
return "preferably before
Wednesday night [this evening|".
Rob Park, R C S U Publicity
Officer and H o n Sec-elect,
assured Felix that if the 3HP
"can be returned to any C C U
office, no questions will be
asked."
He warned that if the pot is
found in anyone's possession
after this time, then steps will be
taken to involve the Metro-
politan Police and set in motion
the Imperial College Union disci-
plinary procedure.

Banks:"Tory hypocrisy"
Tony Banks, Labour M P for
Newham North, gave an outspo-
ken talk on a range of subjects
last Wednesday at a meeting of
IC Labour Club.
He made plain his disgust
with the Tories for their
hypocrisy over the Scott report,
particularly the ministers who
did not resign after having misled
parliament, but called for the
resignation of the shadow Welsh
Secretary after a remark he made
regarding Prince Charles' suit-
ability for the throne. M r Banks
also said he looked forward to
seeing a united Ireland.
Though looking forward to
seeing Labour in power, he is
aware of the difficulties the party
will face after being on the oppo-
sition benches so long, especially
as he will still have to ask diffi-
cult questions of ministers.
Smiling ruefully, he rated his
chances of becoming a minister
himself as "slim".
Physicist dies in crash
A second year Physics under-
graduate, Christos Orillas, was
killed in a road accident in
France on the 9th of March.
Christos made a lasting
impression on many people dur-
ing his time at Imperial College.
Departmental staff described
him as a quiet student who was a
pleasure to teach. He was study-
ing Physics with Theoretical
Physics and his enthusiasm con-
vinced many that he would have
given a great deal to science.
To his fellow students, he
was someone who always had
time for others. He was respect-
ed for his wit and intelligence as
well as his top academic perfor-
mance, and was always ready to
listen to other people's problems
He was always warm, funny, and
understanding, whatever the sit-
uation demanded. Chris was also
a keen member of the Hellenic
Society, who have expressed
their condolences to the family.
The funeral was held in
France, but his family visited the
Physics department last Friday
and were deeply moved by the
sorrow expressed by Chris's
many friends, who came to see
them.

Emergency numbers
Kenneth Weir, Deputy Head ol
Security, has highlighted an
increase in the incidence of
bogus 4444 calls on the internal
telephone network.
The 4444 code, which is a
direct dial number to the securi-
ty desk, was established to alert
Security to emergency situations
on campus and not for day-to-
day use. Bogus calls make the
service less effective, and endan-
ger those who have a genuine
problem.
Another security issue cur-
rently a problem around the
campus is a rise in reported pick-
pocketing and theft from motor
vehicles. Imperial College
Security remind students and
staff to be alert and to keep an
eye on their belongings.
