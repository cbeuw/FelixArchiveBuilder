j o u r n a l i s t s
Ever since I started this job I
have insisted that I'm not a jour-
nalist, that I have no intention of
adopting journalism as a career,
and that this one-year foray into
the printed media didn't make
me one of them.
But nonetheless, when I get
introduced, that's the label I
have to live with, and that's the
corner I had to explain m y way
out ol one day this week when
the assembled company had had
just a bit too m u c h of t h e
Dunblane tragedy. W e had been
watching the N e w s at Ten's
"home affairs correspondent"
storming into the home of
Thomas Hamilton's mother in
Glasgow: "Didyon have any idea
that your son had the potential to
take the lives of so many innocent
children? Didu't you ever think it
was strange that he should want
to spend so much time with little
boys?"
N o w I'm not lor one
moment trying to suggest that
editing Felix is akin to being
some kind of hardnosed, ruthless
Fleet Street hack, but in some
small way I can empathise with
that kind o l journalistic sensa-
tionalism. I've felt the frustra-
tion of watching someone throw
away a great many hours' worth
of informative articles because
they're all "boring".
Everyone knows that you
get a certain kick out of finding
out something scandalous before
anyone else, and being able to
announce the news like it's some
prized possession of your own. It
gets somewhat better when
you're announcing it to several
thousand people rather than just
your flatmates. What must it feel
like, I wonder, having your
byline on the front page of the
Sun, knowing that several million
people are going to devote their
attention to what you have to
say?
It really is true that journal-
ism is a massively corrupting
force. Many times in the couple
of years I've been involved with
Felix I've seen otherwise
thoughtful and caring individuals
turn thoroughly nasty as they
worry at the bones of a story, not
afraid to keep kicking and kick-
ing and digging some more when
their victim is down. It's times
like this week when I am
immensely thankful that the vast
majority of what we deal with
here centres around issues like
electronic cash cards and Estates

We Want
blatant publicists to plus ICU for all it's
worth. Yes! It's time we were all thinking
about the
1996 Union handbook
Papers for the elected positions to amass
information, edit and put tosether the nan-
book have been put up: see Rachel in the
Felix office for more details... oh, and you
get money for the privilege, too.
Clubs and Societies
You should really be thinking about how
you're going to publicise yourselves and get
huge numbers of new members next year
NOW! That means taking photographs of
what you get up to, and begining to think
what you want to say about what you do
and where you're going.
