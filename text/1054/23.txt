IC II 4 - 0 UCH
It was a joyous sunny morning
as IC II found themselves at
Harlington with a full team and
nearly six supporters.
This unprecedented
turnout led to some confusion;
the match was preceded by a
changing room catfight as only
seven full strips emerged from
the kitbag and Juliette ran off
with the last sock.
The first half was messy
but debutante Sarah Turner
made her mark with a well
timed goal.
IC really showed off their
ball skills in the second half as
Joanna banged one in and then
Juliette did her stuff.
Well done IC, onwards
and upwards next season.
Mixed form and ban for
Irnpcricil Bocit C>lub
Last Saturday saw the eagerly
awaited match between
Imperial College and Cambridge
Boat Race Clubs. The supreme
confidence of the Cambridge
crew was evident, more so after
they were handed a length lead
from the start.
However, by the four
minute mark, IC had drawn
level, and finished 2/3 lengths
ahead at the end of the Chiswick
Ait. The second race saw the
Light Blues cross into IC's water
and amazingly unpunished for
this by the umpires, they man-
aged to win by a half length.
Cambridge will need more than
bad umpiring if they hope to
retain the Beefeater Trophy this
year.
The Queen's Tower Eight
met the G oldie crew over the
same distances. Unfortunately, a
mistake in the coxing allowed
Goldie to take the first piece,
but IC won the second by a larg-
er margin in what was described
as a 'confidently inevitable' win.
Similar form was displayed
by IC at the Reading University
Head. The Novices won this
event by 30 seconds, and the
Senior VIII's were also victori-
ous. The IC Ill's were beaten by
both the ISI seconds and Oxford
Brookes' first crews.
On a sourer note, it seems
that the entire club is to be pun-
ished with disqualification from
the 1996 Head of the River
Race, due to some errors in the
entry for two IC boats, leaving
IC unable to defend their title.
It seems that the committee
intends to make an example of
one of Britain's top clubs.
IC crews will be competing
though in the prestigious Hein-
eken Head in Amsterdam,
where they will be guests of
Holland's top student club
Nereus.
They are also to race at the
Woman's Head and at the
Kingston Head.
SportsNews
Well, England won the rugby
and Sri Lanka won the ericket. As
for anyone stupid enough to give
BSkyB a tenner for the privilege of
watching a bit of broadcasting from
Las Vegas at a ridiculous hour of
Sunday morning: you would have
been better off getting a good night's
sleep, quite frankly.
