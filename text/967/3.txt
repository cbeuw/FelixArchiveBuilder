Editorial
Allow me the indulgence of your
imagination for a few minutes.
Suppose you are the manager of a
large business. Let's take it a little
closer to home; imagine you are the
head of a College of the University
of London. s
Now, let's expand it a little
further, you have noticed that one
of the departments under your remit
is making a severe financial loss. Of
course, this cannot continue, but
what is your first step? Should you
close down the Department? Make
serious cuts in the running cost of
the area concerned? Break up the
Department and merge it with
another, more profitable, part of the
College?
Whatever you decide, how would
you do it? When you make serious
cost cutting efforts, people are
going to get hurt, jobs are going to
be lost. What about the prospective
students to the department? If they
apply to a course and then find that
its entire structure has been changed
in order to save money, they will
not be happy. Also there are
academic concerns. A department
losing money does not mean a
department unable to contribute
greatly to the sum of knowledge.
After all, teaching is what
Universities are meant to be there
for. It could be that this department
teaches and researches topics that
are not covered anywhere else in the
country. Upheaval in that
department could affect the
academic standing of the whole
College.
To continue with our fanciful
speculation, there is also another

As users of the Underground may
already be aware, a new breed of
beggar has appeared on the stations,
or to be more precise, on the trains.
They walk from carriage to
carriage, with the look of
hopelessness on their faces and a
pathetic appearance complimented
by the jumble sale clothes they
wear. As they approach you, your
in-built prejudices may dismiss
them as low- lifes, wastrels,
underlings to be ignored. But your
thoughts are soon taken away once
you spot the give away to their
identity: a piece of ragged paper
held feebly in one hand. What does
problem; the situation must be
sorted out very quickly. Money
cannot go pouring down the drain,
but time must be set aside to
convince members of staff of any
rearrangments. It does not do to
steamroller any alteration over
staff. Imperial College had a vivid
reminder of that during the
Messenger, Security and Car
Parking dispute last year.
Fine. Whatever you decide, you
need at least to talk to all the people
concerned. The head of the
department, the lecturers, the Old
student associations, all the support
staff involved. Oh, I suppose the
actual students studying there will
have to be told, but they hardly
matter. A few might complain, but
the vast majority just get on with
this paper have written on it?
I'm not too sure to be honest,
because the handwriting can be
scruffy. But key words include
'Bosnia', 'refugee', 'poor',
'homeless' and 'help'. Anyone they
approach doesn't really read it, and
certainly no one gives generously.
But can you blame them? Since it
was highlighted some time ago, that
beggars can earn a small fortune per
day, the public have become more
sceptical as to their authenticity.
Nevertheless, roaming the trains
is at the least a different approach
and the original beggar deserves
credit (wouldn't he prefer cash ! -
Ed). But it fails. Despite the
situation in the late-Yugoslavia,
obtaining sympathy, and with it
some money, from commuters who
loathe the unpredictable tube, is
harder than getting blood from a
stone.

their work and do very little else.
It hardly seems worthwhile to
indulge the egos of a few oversized
teenagers in affairs like this.
Besides, in a few years they will be
gone. It seems like they have no
concern anyway. After all how
many voices of student outrage
were raised when Sir Eric Ash
announced a 're-examination' of
our position within the University
of London? Who, sabbaticals aside,
complained about the extension of
the college day, that ignored a
referendum taken three years ago
by Imperial students who said they
did not want it? Is it really two years
since the Rector's last Question
Time?
No don't bother with the
students, they aren't worth talking

This is a piss take. (No spite or
malice is intended)
To get social colours off your C C U ,
I was told, you basically had to do
nothing except hang around the
C C U exec a lot. Take a look at the
RCS Union Awards List 1992-93 to
see what I mean: Paul Thomas,
Dave Goddard, The B/sht editors,
you get the idea.
Why then did they include such
contributors as Jonty Beavan?
Strange.

Fill in the missing word, that was

In case you haven't already worked
it out, I'm still here. What would
quitting achieve? A few letters from
some students expressing their
delight and the chance for me to
commandeer a couple of pages to
say an exaggerated farewell and to
have one final big bitch. That I
would really enjoy; to say all the
things that I have held back about
anyone that has ever pissed me off.
He who laughs last and all that. It
will happen one day, but not within
the immediate future, I hope.
