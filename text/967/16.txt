Don't make me laugh.

Do you think they're sad old
bastards? I dunno. I suppose it
could be our next vox pop feature...
Gene Loves Jezebel; is hanging too
good for them?
P a r c h m a n : Isolation
Tastefully executed technofest in
the sort of Front 242/MDMA post-
goth mould, featuring remixes by
The Grid. The title track delicately
exposes a vocal, a slight and waifish
girlsound contributing to what is,
overall, a smooth and airborne
production. I was not previously
familiar with the name Parchman,
but I arched my eyebrow pencil
upon discovering their origins lay
in Easterhouse.
The other track, 'Small' is a little
Gene Loves Jezebel: Time to pull the chain
more vicious, betraying their
ancestry a wee bit. Lyrically, we
are concerned with a couple of
rhetorical questions on the
separateness of ourselves as human
beings. They may not be the first
pop artists to have spotted that the
human race is anything but a
collective being, but full marks to
them anyway, 'cause at least they're
not patronising me. I dunno about
you, though.

Ugly: Arty or just unfocused
Ugly: B o o m the Future
Glenn Gregory is apparentiy keen
to leave Heaven 17 behind him;
hence this release by his latest
project, Ugly. It is therefore slightly
mystifying that he chooses to begin
this so soon after both the re-
releases of 'Fascist Groove Thing',
'Temptation', and their version of
'Gimme Shelter' for Putting Our
House In Order. Believe me, I'm
sincerely puzzled. M y tongue
couldn't be further from my cheek.
'Boom The Future' is everything
you'd expect it to be; smooth, cool
and ultra- slick, with all four mixes
typically sophisticated elegance.
The chorus features the phrase
'Brothers and Sisters' -1 ask you.
What are we to expect next of
Ugly? 'I was 37, you were 17'? Ah,
sod it. He always was too cool for
words.

M a c h i n e : D r a g o n f l y m a n i a
E.P.
Alarm bells are ringing. They are
the sound of words like 'the
revolution has started, and you're
tripping off your face'. Thanks, I
say. 'Stick a few A & R men against
the wall for me, won't you?' Come
the revolutionary tribunal, I'll be up
there with them. With Bucks Fizz
and Jello Biafra. Shit, dad. You
never told me to prepare for this.

The M i l l t o w n B r o t h e r s —
T u r n Off
Unfortunate really. The title I
mean. I can see so many 'concept
reviews' that some people will find
humourous. To be honest, nothing
seems to have changed for them in
the past two years, which is a shame
really because the rest of us are
older and wiser,
peb
The N a k e d T r u t h — R e a d
B e t w e e n the Lines
Ten inch records are, what's the
word, economic. No that's
definitely not right. Ergonomic, I
think that's right. Unfortunately,
ergonomic can also describe the
toons. 'Hey man, can you spare
some change?' Is this offering
supposed to change people's
attitudes, educate? Your average
punter is going to see this as average
American rock. They may not be
Americans, but who cares, it's a
shame really as it's not that bad. If
you like that sort of thing.
Choc.
The C u k o o s — T h e Screever
The cover depicts cave paintings, a
farmer, a hunter and the sun. A m
I supposed to take this seriously?
It's modern folk music, complete
with badly sampled tacky sea
noises. Three years ago they had
about five good toons, where have
they gone? Does everybody that
cares about the plant end up
sounding like The Levellers.

M o t h e r E a r t h — H o m e Your
Feeling Better
A nice funky one this. The sort of
toon that makes listening to records
fun. Who needs pretentious,
'meaningful' lyrics, if you don't
know the world's fucked by now
it's too late to tell you. Get out there
and enjoy yourself, I certainly will
be. Buy this.
Ont he flip are two super-funky
tracks. 'Little Bag O' Sugar'
slightly jazzy, Jonathan E, well
groovy.

Kittenbirds — H o n e y , Y o u ' r e
S i c k
So you can accuse this of being
N M E 'art school' music, but at a
time when is seems hardly any
anyone is doing anything that I
could fine remotely interesting, this
has to worth a listen.
Sounding remarkably constrained at
the beginning it winds up in a
crescendo or turmoil that I would
have to consider the purchasing of
some serious safety equipment
before attending one of their
concerts,
peb
Television P e r s o n a l i t i e s —
G o o d n i g h t M r S p a c e m a n
'Oh bloodyhell, I wish I'd signed
to Creation'. This is so apt. If they
had perhaps there would be some
remote possiblity that this would get
the somewhere near the attention
deserves. It has an excessively
energetic feel to is that would
makae most people do car-wheels
acrross the floor.
'I've taken three e's, I still can't
dance like Bobbie Gallespie'. I
could quote some other lyrics, but
then what would be the point in you
buying the record? But rest assure,
the phyrase 'Goodnight M r .
Spaceman' is liberaly littered
around the place,
peb
P r u g s t o r y — A l i v e
Being depresive is something that
this manages from the outset. But
then the mental image that is
conjured up by Isabel Monteiro's
voice (vocals/bass) is not one of a
happy ponytailed freckly kid, with
a smile evosticked to her face. More
the merose and contempletive type
me thinks. This makes the job of
passing and crytical comments
difficult, it is too easy for me to
magionalise her and forget it. This
is something that I don't want to so
perhaps I should stop now.
Peb
Sprial T r i b e — F o r w a r d the
Revolution
(If this is the cutting edge of techno,
rave, new age rage, call it what you
will, I'm a Monkee's Uncle—Ug
Og.)
Four tracks that rely upon
pounding your head with a 150bpm
bass to hypnotise you. Free parties,
what a load of crap. What we need
now ain't no new hippies. Love.
Who needs it. RESPECT, that's
more like it. Anger, getting better.
Going to a field and forgetting my
worries, the world's worries is the
last thing on my mind.
