More voting Film triumph
by J o n t y B e a v a n
Election fever has again hit Imperial
College as the race for the new post
of Deputy President (Clubs and
Societies), hots up.
At the time of writing, only one
candidate, Charles Leary, has put
himself forward. M r Leary, a final
year Biology student, is proposed
by Grahame Hey and almost
completely seconded. In the
previous set of Sabbatical elections,
during March, M r Leary stood for
the post of Honourary Secretary
(Events), but withdrew for reasons
that were never made clear. Due to
an inconclusive result, another
election has to held for the post.
Before rerunning the contest, M r
Dominic Wilkinson, current Hon
Sec (Events) has changed his
position's job description. As part
of the general restructuring of
Imperial College Union, the Hon
Sec (Events) post is to become
solely responsible for student Clubs
and Societies.
If no further candidates announce
themselves by 5 pm this evening,
Mr Leary will only be opposed by
New Election. Hustings for the post
will be held on Thursday 3rd June
in the Union, with voting taking
place on Monday 7th and Tuesday
8th June.
Oxford women win
b y A n d r e w T s e n g
a n d D e c l a n Curry
Oxford University was found to be
guilty of sex discrimination and
hypocrisy over its equal
opportunities policy this week.
Dons voted 182 to 37 in favour
of rejecting the appointment of 15
professorships at Congregation, the
University's parliament. The
£100,000 pounds will go instead
towards lower level promotions, as
currently 20 per cent of lecturers at
the University are women. This
compares to 4 women professors,
less than 5.1 per cent, of the
University's senior academic
community.
The University's commitment to
its equal opportunities policy has
been questioned after revelations
that it had turned down the advice
of its equal opportunities
committee. The committee had
urged the university to create
readerships.
The high profile proposals at
Oxford have fuelled the national
equal opportunities debate. The
Association of University Teachers
has pointed out that women
professors are paid on average
£1500 less than their male
counterparts. A much higher
proportion of women than men
professors are in the under £34000
per annum pay bracket. Less than
20 per cent of men professors fall
into this category.
The decision can still be upturned
if the university's senior executive
body, Council, decides that the
proposals should go to a postal
ballot. In the event of this
happening, equal opportunities
campaigners are confident that the
66 per cent majority of this week's
vote is an indication of the ultimate
outcome of any university wide
ballot.
In an interview with i C N N
Imperial College Radio, Emma
Westcot, the Women's Officer at
Oxford University said that, 'This
decision will encourage women
looking for a career in academia.'
Barber plans for ICU
by our man in the toilet
Plans are afoot within ICU to move
the games machines from the
Games room, currently next door
to Da Vinci's in the Union Building,
and use the room for another, as yet
unspecified, purpose.
The reason for the movement of
games machines is to enable a
restructuring of the toilets situated
behind the Games Room, to allow
for their use by disabled people.
This refurbishment will involve an
expansion into part of the games
room.
Suggestions have been mooted
that while the lavatory update is in
progress, the Games room will also
undergo a complete facelift.
Current proposals imply that a
Barbers or Hairdresser salon could
be installed in the remaining space.
Where the games machines would
be moved to, if this proposal went
through, has yet to be considered.
The New Imperial College Union Cinema opened last Thursday, with
unprecedented success writes Jonty Beavan.
An audience of over seventy people, watched the film 'Singles' in the
Union Concert Hall. This was the first showing of any film by Imperial
College Unions Film Society in its new location. Until before Easter the
Society's showings were located in Mech Eng 220. Mr Laugharne, one
of the projectionists, said he was 'amazed, we never expected so many
people'. Yesterday's showing of 'Scent of a Woman' was expected to be
just as well attended.
Improvements will continue to the ICU Cinema over summer: Two 35
millimetre projectors are to be bought and a projection gallery installed
at the rear of the Concert Hall. It is hoped that all the changes will be
completed for the beginning of the next academic year.
STOIC getting bigger
by Jonty n' Donny
STOIC, Imperial College's very
own television station, is planning
to expand from its base on the third
floor of the Union Building.
STOIC (Student Television of
Imperial College) plots to overflow
into the Clubs Committee room.
This extra space sits next to the
present STOIC studio on the highest
floor of the Union Building.
The plans have yet to confirmed,
but will meet their final testing at
the next meeting of House
committee. House committee is a
student body responsible for
fixtures and furnishing of the
Imperial College Union building.
