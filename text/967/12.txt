The Oppression of Tibet
During his much publicised visit to the UK, the Dalai Lama made a
plea for an end to the torture and mass murder in Tibet. Sonia Shah
reports on a refreshingly open and honest man.
Last week I was honoured to meet
a most extraordinary man - Tenzin
Gyatso, His Holiness the fourteenth
Dalai Lama of Tibet, Tibet's
political and spiritual leader. The
Dalai Lama's unique nobility is
conferred on him by virtue of his
being a manifestation of the
Boddhisattva of Compassion, who
chose rebirth to serve humanity; the
present Dalai Lama regards himself
as a 'simple Buddhist Monk'.
This enlightened man was
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in
1989 for his non-violent struggle for
the liberation of Tibet - a
tremendous feat in light of the great
Chinese aggression.
In his trip to Britain, he has not
only met with the Foreign Secretary
Douglas Hurd, the Archbishop of
Canterbury, and National and
European Members of Parliament,
but has also given a series of
lectures on how to live 1'fe with
wisdom and compassion; this man
is truly an inspiration to everyone
who hears him, or reads his
writings.
Since 1950, 1.2
million Tibetans,
1/5 of the
population, have
died as a result
of the Chinese
occupation.
The Dalai Lama was born on 6
July 1935, in the small village of
Taktser in North-Eastern Tibet. At
the age of two, this son of a peasant
family was hailed as the
reincarnation of each of the
previous thirteen Dalai Lamas of
Tibet. He began his monastic
education at the age of six, during
which time in 1950 he was forced
to assume complete political power
when China invaded Tibet. Tibet
found itself in a helpless situation,
overpowered by the military force
of China. The invasion of Tibet was
an act of aggression and violation
of international law and human
rights, yet pleas for help to several
leading nations of the world, and to
political prisoners are held in
prisons and labour camps. Tibetan
women are subjected to mandatory
sterilisation and forced abortion.
Prisoners are subjected to various
Chinese to move to Tibet by
offering incentives.
The Chinese have caused
destruction of Tibet's natural
resources and widespread
the United Nations, were rejected.
In 1954, on an official visit to
China, meetings with Mao Tse-tung
and political authorities uncovered
the contradictions of political life in
China. Communism in China is
strongly anti-religious, while
Tibet's whole culture and way of
life is centred on Buddhism. The
Chinese Government has never
attempted to understand the Tibetan
people, or their culture.
In 1959, during the national
uprising of the Tibetan people
against Chinese occupation, the
Dalai Lama was forced into exile.
Since then he has been living in
Dharamsala, India, seat of the
Tibetan Government-in-exile.
Tibetan people everywhere in the
world, believe their Government-
in-exile to be the sole legitimate
Government of Tibet.
Since 1950, 1.2 million Tibetans,
1/5 of the population, have died as
a result of the Chinese occupation.
Thousands of religious and
forms of torture including being
suspended from their prison ceiling,
electrocution, beatings with cattle
prods, and interrogation at gun

seem profitable',

Official.
point - for expressing their beliefs.
Today, over 120,000 Tibetans
are living in exile.
China forbids the teaching of
Buddhism - a facade of religious
freedom has been initiated for the
purposes of propaganda and
tourism. Chinese 'population
transfer' is being encouraged,
making Tibetans a minority in their
own country- 7.5 million Chinese
compared with 6 million Tibetans
in Tibet. The Chinese authorities
actively encourage large numbers of
environmental devastation.
I would like to describe my
meeting with the Dalai Lama at a
press conference in London. On
entering the room, he did not go
straight to his seat, but instead
warmly greeted members of the
press. As he sat down, one
immediately felt his sheer
captivating presence and calmness.
During the press conference the
Dalai Lama showed tremendous
insight and a friendly sense of
humour. The Dalai Lama is not
some distant religious figure, but is
a human being who bases his life
on compassion, peace, altruism and
kindness. He is refreshingly open
and honest and puts up none of the
barriers so common of other
political leaders.
The Dalai Lama made it clear for
the first time that the option of
independence for Tibet has been
foreclosed and said that he wants to
discuss a 'one country, two
systems' approach, similar to that
