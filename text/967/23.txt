Cricket Tournament Cricket-UL cup 1st Round
From the guys who brought you the
IC Indoor Soccer Tournament,
comes a brand new competition.
Since most of us have finished our
exams, and it is undoubtedly
summertime judging by the amount
of sun we've had in May, it's about
time a cricket tournament was
organised.
The final format of the
tournament is undecided, since it
depends upon the number of teams
entering. However, the most likely
outcome is that it will be a straight
knock-out competition, with each
game being played over 40 overs.
And with a £10 entrance fee, there
will be a trophy and prize of money
on offer.
Any team can enter, staff or
student society, with games being
played on Wednesday afternoons
and the weekends. If nothing else,
it may entice a few teams to play
the Pakistan Society. And who
knows, they may complete the
double this year, by winning both
the Imperial Football and cricket
tournaments.
If you are interested, then please
contact Khurrum (Comp PG3,
x7522, email: khs@doc.ic). Watch
this space for more details.
Hopefully, this will give those not
playing regular cricket a chance to
show what they can do!

A superb display of sustained
attacking batting saw IC 1st team
cruise into the quarter-finals of the
U L Cup at the expense of Q M W C
1st team in a match reduced to 32
overs each due to the opposition's
late arrival.
Some fine strokeplay, aided by a
succession of no-balls and wides,
helped IC to get off to a flying start
which every middle order batsman,
led by Daffyd Owen and then Ben
Maxwell, took full advantage of.
Iqbal Khan then saw us through the
final few overs as we finished on
207 for 7, at a remarkable run-rate
of almost 6.5 runs per over.
QMWC were thus faced with the
daunting task of scoring at well over
a run a ball right from the start of
their innings. This task was made
more or less impossible within 4
overs as Steve Trussell and Iqbal
Khan removed both their opening
batsmen before 10 runs had been
scored, and after some defiance
from the following pair of batsmen,
wickets started to fall regularly in
a forlorn search for runs as QMWC
subsided to 116 all out.
