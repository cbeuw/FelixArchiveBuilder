Mary's madness
Dear Jonty,
Being in my final year, I now
have only a few weeks remaining
as a student here. As the end of term
nears, I find myself reflecting on
my years spent at Imperial College.
I must say that although it hasn't
been a bed of roses every minute,
overall I've really enjoyed being
here. At times the work was simply
beyond a joke, and I wouldn't wish
the stress of final exams on my
worst enemy. But I think that the
academic pressure made me enjoy
my free time all the more, ensuring
that I've had some really good
times.
There are, however, two things
that have really pissed me off while
Dear Jonty,
Having received a number of
invitations to donate my wealth to
College when I get run over by a
bus, I would like to illustrate three
good reasons as to why I will not
be altering my will.
Firsdy, would you donate money
to an organisations that is planting
flower beds next to a building

I have been here. The first of these
are the IC students that do nothing
but slag the college off at every
opportunity. Fair enough, I can
understand why some people don't
like it here. But I wish that these
people would do something positive
and take charge of their lives. In
short, if you don't like it here
L E A V E and leave it to those of us
that do.
The second thing that really gets
up my nose is the whole business
with St Mary's. It's a situation that
I still don't really understand, even
after being here for four years. I
think that I would be correct in
saying that the vast majority of IC
students at South Kensington and
proposed to be demolished, which
incidentally has already had all the
protective fencing demolished by

Mary's give each other very little
thought. But there seems,
unfortunately, to be a small hard-
core group of sad mothers at both
sites that are pre-occupied with each
other. An example of such an
obsessed individual is 'Moron'
(Letters page last issue). One word
of advice; please get a life, whoever
you are. That goes for all those who
have in the past, and no doubt will
in the future, perpetuate the myth
of an IC—St Mary's feud. In his
letter, 'Moron' accused all Imperial
students of self-abuse. I take it from
last week's letter that 'Moron'
happens to be at Mary's (I feel sorry
for my friends there), and as such
is an IC student. I really do admire
him for coming out into the open.
I mean, to be a wanker and call
yourself one in print. Just goes to
show, once a wanker, always a
David Gurney to live in bernard
Sunley for a year without paying a
penny in rent, then I don't think
you'd be particularly inclined to
either.
Thirdly, if your will was spent on
a 486 PC Clone and Fax machine
for the security front gate because
some department had to 'get rid' of
some money in an attempt to get an
even bigger budget next year would
you be impressed? I doubt it very
much.

Apart from the above gripes, I
don't regret coming here at all. I
have met some really sound people
at IC (and not one trainspotter,
although I'm still looking), and
count myself extremely fortunate in
having the best group of friends that
anyone could wish for—I don't
know how you've put up with me
for all these years!! Thanks a lot for
everything. I'll really miss you all,
and Imperial when I leave.
Yours
Kaveh Guilanpour, Biochem 3.
P.S. Yes, I know that you're all
just pretending and that I don't have
any friends really!
P.P.S. I apologise for the
excessive bad language used in this
letter, and pray that my mother
doesn't see it!
This College has a considerable
amount going for it and it certainly
would appear to be the case that the
best staff are recruited for research
work. It would perhaps be wise to
consider implementing the same
policy for the kind of staff that allow
the above to happen. I might then
be inclined to reconsider my
decision.
Yours sincerely,
Gavin J R Pearson, Mech Eng 3.
