How Our Wet Dreams Came 'rue
Kevin Costner is back at FilmSoc
this week in The Bodyguard,
playing Frank Farmer, a topnotch
professional bodyguard—maybe the
best. His latest client is Rachel
Marron, pop superstar-turned-
actress, played by Whitney
Houston, who has successfully
moved in real life from pop
megastar to talented actress.
Rachel's fabulous career just seems
to spiral upward without end, and
with it comes the usual trappings of
success—a manager, a publicist, a
horde of hangers-on and one that's
much more sinister. A n obsessive
fan writes her crazy letters and
breaks into her bedroom, so it's
time for the flamboyant diva to get
herself some serious protection—
and Frank Farmer is the best. Both
Frank and Rachel expect to be in
charge...what they don't expect is
to fall in love...
Lots of action, plenty of drama,
romantic moments.. .everyone will
find something in this film. Much
of the soundtrack has been through
the charts...a couple of number
ones including the record-breaking
hit J Will Always Love You. If you
haven't seen the film but the songs
have been driving you wild over the
last five months, now is your
chance to find out what they all
mean.
Remember we show in the
cinematic splendour of the Concert
Hall, two floors above Da Vinci's
bar, and believe it or not, our screen
is bigger than many at local
cinemas, and we're a lot cheaper at
only £1.90 (90p for members). The
reels will be turning for The
Bodyguard at precisely 7.30pm next
Thursday. The following week we
have Under Siege, and following
the success of last night's
Budweiser competition, we have
lots of Under Siege sweatshirts,
caps, and torches to give away
courtesy of our friends at Warner
Brothers. Don't miss it!
shells! Pete brought up a few rusted
lumps of metal, that Steve
proceeded to chuck back in the
water.
The afternoon's entertainment
was the Falmouth subs. No
problem, Um, lots of kelp and a few
broken up submarines, but a huge
swell! The fish had a good feed
from some very green looking
novices. When our stomachs had
stopped heaving, we retired to the
pub for more beer.
As the week progressed, we
dived, drank and drove the marine
wildlife round the bend. Steve's
continued to find any wrecks we
wanted to by instinct and not
instrument. One of the highlights
for me was the trip's night dive.
After a few hours sitting in a
freezing van in a freezing wet suit,
the sun finally set and we could get
in the water and get it over with.
Why you would want to dive at
night is not that obvious, after all
it's cold and dark enough during the
day! At night, a lot of the marine
life comes out to eat, and on this
night have 400 watt dive torches
shined in their faces by divers. We
found two dead dogfish, and a
swarm of swimming crabs. It was
a really eerie experience swimming
through the darkness, with fish
suddenly racing across your torch
beam. After about three quarters of
an hour of this, I started to get cold
and we headed back for shore. This
was a bad move, as it was even
colder out of the water!
On our last night in Cornwall, we
had our trip piss up and a chance
to sum up the week's diving. The
major shock was the 'cleavage of
the trip' award not going to Pete
after a tough challenge by Ian. The
'cutest buddy pair' went to Gary
and Sheena, for holding hands
under water and having matching
drysuits. Scott, one of this year's
new novice divers won the 'most
dive leader like novice' award for
checking up on Petes, (one of our
most experienced divers) air, and
then refusing to go home when told.
Ian was also unofficially awarded
'trip back seat driver' for telling
Holf and Steve how to drive a boat,
and then cowering in the bottom of
the boat when it got a bit rough.
In all an excellent week's diving.
If you fancy a go, meet us down the
union bar on Tuesday evening, or
see us next year at the Freshers'
Fair.

We stayed on a caravan sight on the
cliffs at St Keverne, (just around the
corner from the bay featured in the
new BT ad) and dived out of
Falmouth.
At the start of each day we met
up for dive briefing. Simon, our
Dive Officer (or mum to us) gave
us the run down for the day. This
included the bad news (normally the
weather), the good news that we
were actually going diving and a
reminder of the trip motto, 'be safe
and sensitive'. Our first taste of
open water diving, (and salt water)
was round the next bay at
Porthouslock. Kitting-up was no
problem, but getting into the water,
well! After staggering around in the
surf like drunk penguins, we finally
got our heads under water. Wow!
It's not at all like the pool—no tiles,
old elastoplasts or hair bands. After
floundering around in three meters
getting sorted out, we set off for a
good mooch. This involves
rummaging around in the kelp and
molesting any crustacean or fish
stupid enough to get caught. Far too
soon, the pressure gauges hit 50bar
and we had to go back to dry land,
and the next major obstacle, getting
out! Some more penguin
impressions and a good go at a
beached whale from Scott and that
was it, our first dive. We dived the
same beach in the afternoon and
then retired for lots of the second
activity of a dive holiday—drinking.
The second day gave us a chance
to use our new boat, a bright orange
rigid inflatable (see picture). We
hired Steve, the owner of the local
dive shop to take us out on his new
big blue rib, with CPS, echo
sounder and any other electronic
gadget you can buy (to be wired for
sound as well for next year). After
flying over the waves for half an
hour, Steve looked around, stopped
the boat and threw over the shot-
line. 'Straight down, you should
land on her boilers' were his
confident words, and not one look
at his gadgets. Down into the murky
depth we plunged, and out of the
gloom loomed a huge lump of metal
that made up the Volnay's boiler.
Now that's what I call navigation!
This was it, real diving and no kelp,
but I did find an elastoplast. The
Volnay was a first world war
ammunition ship, and mum's
instructions for the dive were 'if it's
live, it's got to be legal, if it's dead
it's got to be dead', i.e. no live
