Glyph McCord goesin pursuit of Radiohead
A couple of weeks ago, Radiohead
were referred to in these pages as
'one of the best new bands in
Britain', and notwithstanding our
less than superhuman stature in the
kingmaker department (and I do
mean a maker of kings, not the
fucking band), you would not even
sniff tentatively unless there was a
good dose of the Channel's finest
beside you. Yet again, you were
right; we make a glib statement, put
it in a particularly vulgar shirt, and
send it out with a public school
education, a beef paste sandwich
and fiick all else to back it up.
So what makes them 'one of the
best new bands in Britain'?
Nothing. We lied. Sometimes we
can't do anything else; whether it's
a question of ulterior motives, or
fibbing for the sake of it, and to
abuse our position of authority.
They aren't nearly aerodynamic
enough for my liking. Glyph may
have thought 'Pablo Honey' was
brilliant, but from what I've heard
of them, I think a Radiohead record
is more accurately described with
the words retentive, navel-
contemplating wankfest. They're
fucking ugly, too. But that's purely
my opinion. I'm just pissed off
'cause I have to type this bloody
thing in. If you like them,
toothbrush your eyes and sit back,
for Glyph MacCord's completely
non-indulgent rollercoaster ride,
entitled 'an evening with
Radiohead'. Fucking saggy
scrotums, they are...
Mike and tapedeck on, check.
Lad's haircut in place, and... check.
Toothy grin? Make up! where the
hell's my toothy grin? Oh, right,
ok.
'In an unprecedented twist to the
band interview format, Jonny
Greenwood - Abingdon school's
'Most likely to become an axe
murderer' and lead guitarist for
Radiohead - turns the mike on
Glyph MacCord.'
Was that an ok take? Jeez, I'm
sweating like fuck! Someone get
some coffee down here, and be
quick about it!
G - 'Jonny, got time for a quick
interview?'
J - 'O.k. (Grasps mike and lunges
at the bewildered MacCord) So,
where are you and what are the
vibes like?'
G - 'Backstage at U L U . Sweaty'
J - 'What d'you think of
Radiohead this evening?'
G - 'Boring. I've heard that set
about six times now. We only came
for the interview'
J - 'Do you do a lot of interviews,
then?'
G - 'Not really, mostly gigs and
records'
J - 'Who have you seen recentiy?'
G - 'Peach, 3 1/2 Minutes, Mint
