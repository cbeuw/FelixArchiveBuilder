Time for change
The Union faces another upheaval with the publication of the report into
the Union Structure. StevenNewhouse reports on why55 into 13 doesn't go.
ICU BY-LAWS
The Imperial College Union by-
laws state, the purpose of ICU is
a) the promotion of student
intercourse between present and
past students and academic staff
of the College.
b) the encouragement of interest
by the students in matters outside
the College curriculum, especially
cultural and athletic interests.
c) the provision of a corporate
body of students to represent,
safeguard and advance the
interests and welfare of the
students of the College.
Over the last two weeks, Felix has
been covering the results of the
working party into the Union
Structure. The main result seems to
be the removal of the present 55
person Council and the Executive
committee, and its replacement with
a new 13 person Executive.
At the moment, Council consists
of all the Sabbaticals, the
Departmental Representatives,
Constituent College Union (CCU)
Presidents and the Majojr and Minor
Sub Committee chairmen. The new
Executive would consist of the three
Union Office Sabbaticals and
officers from the representation
areas. However, this smaller body
would have the same mandate as the
current Council and Executive, to
manage the affairs of the Union.
Two years ago there was a major
change in how the Union represents
the students. The Union General
Meeting (UGM) that had been held
on a monthly basis was changed to
a termly basis. This forced Council
into becoming a policy making
body which it was not designed to
be.
The proposed changes will force
the new Executive into making
policies, since UGMs will still be
held termly, but it will be even less
representative than Council is at the
moment.
So having thrown cold water on
the report from the working party,
do I have any suggestions?
One of the working party's
conclusions was that Council is too
large to be an effective decision
making body. It is too large to make
effective decisions, but not
representative enough for the policy
decisions that it makes at the
moment.
In the box there are the aims of
Imperial College Union, and it
should be our primary goal to
satisfy these aims and our
organisation should reflect it. These
aims can be interpreted into three
areas of the Union's work: social
events, clubs and societies, and
representation within College.
The representation of the students
within the College organisation is
carried out by Departmental
Representatives, Academic Affairs
Officers, Housing and Welfare
officers.
The management of the clubs and
societies is a task that is at present
carried out by the Major Sub
Committee chairman. The Minor
Sub Committee chairman directly
organises events that are open to all
students.
I would propose that the present
Council is reduced in size and be
concerned only with the effective
running of the Union. Its policy
making powers would be limited to
this area, but it could formulate and
recommended policy to a U G M .
The other officers who represent the
students' views on College
committees would report directiy to
a U G M . Any Union policy that was
needed in these areas could then be
discussed and voted upon by the
student body.
As a result of these changes the

decisions about the internal working
of the Union would be made faster
as many subsiduary committees
would no longer be needed. The
Union General Meeting, which
would be held at least once a month
during term time, would become
the policy making body of Imperial
College Union placing the students
firmly in control of their union.
Under my proposals, Imperial
students would make the decisions
about students at Imperial.
Decisions would be made at the
U G M , open to all students, and not
behind locked doors.
