Faith in Doubt
Attempting to answerhis own questions,Geoff Maxwell justifies faith
in religion.
As a Christian I was recently asked
by a friend how I could justify the
harm that is done inthe name of
religion. Whatever one believes, is
it possible to ignore the weight of
evidence that connects religious
belief with cultural violence? Most
religions share ethical principles
that would seem to preclude
violence as a solution to any
problem, yet historical evidence to
the contrary is abundant.
Before answering the question, I
think it is necessary to define the
basis of religion. What such
definition could hope to be
acceptable to all faiths and even all
men? Such a complex question
demands a simple answer. I
proposed to this friend that there is
an intrinsic human quality that is the
root of any belief.
I asked this friend, an agnostic,
why one should follow the moral
codes of society. Do we resist
stealing because, however great the
gain and however small the
punishment society threatens, we
believe it is wrong. Do we believe
in a human conscience, or are we
restrained only by the fear of
retribution. In summary is there
goodness in every man and are
humans able to distinguish right
from wrong.
If one believes that there is good
in every man, what can one call the
combination of those consciences?
Here we must diverge, different
religions accumulating legend,
history and circumstance to give
their particular creed.
The difficulty we now face is how
to square such ideals with the reality
of destruction in the name of belief.
How does the apparent beauty of
the human conscience become the
bloody sword of fanatics?
Discussing such ideas I have found
that many atheists and agnostics can
believe in human conscience, yet
most believers, of whatever creed,
cannot accept conscience as the
fundamental basis of religion.
I find it challenging to take one
further step. What is god, or are
gods, if they are not that part of
good in every man? This too is,
surprisingly, better suited to the
agnostic than the believer.
Like all institutions the
accumulation of believers into a
congregation brings with it the
amplification of human failure. It is
a small step to exchange these
simple ideals of religion for
absolute confidence in the rules of
one particular creed. When such a
step is made, when one can no
longer lend respect to the view of
another man, then one finds oneself
placed as his enemy.
The one certainty of belief is that
one cannot know of the existence of
a god but can only believe in it. The
main stream religions stand together
in their recognition of gods as
beyond man's knowledge. We can
believe what we may, but when we
believe that we know evetylhing we
presume to place ourselves amongst
the gods.
The wrong that has been done in
the past, and continues to be done
today, in the name of religion, runs
counter to our consciences. This
danger must be held up before all
those who participate in religion as
a warning of what might occur. The
leaders of religion have, I believe,
an obligation to ensure that their
followers understand that our
conception of God may be
misconceived and that the beliefs,
or lack of such, held by other men
should not ever be held against
them.
It need not be said that some
denominations and sections of
certain religions have pursued the
opposing path - seeking to establish-
that their particular interpretation oi
their own belief is absolute and
pursuing relentlessly all those who
opposed them. It seems to me that
it is herein that the evil of religion
lies and it is an evil that is certainly
not necessary.
I find it a pity that even here at
Imperial, a centre of excellence in
learning and scholarship, that so
few people can distinguish between
that which we know and that which
we believe. I can respect any man
who says that, given their
perception of the evidence for the
existence of any particular god, they
cannot find it in their hearts to
believe in such a god. I am however
happy to label any man who says
they know that no such god exists,
or that they have absolute
knowledge of their own god, a
dangerous fool.
If we are able to retain this
perspective on our beliefs there is
no cause for religion to be a source
of pain in the world. That is not to
say that disasters will not happen,
that men will not kill each other,
that brother will not hate brother,
but only that religion will become
what it has always claimed to be.
Thomas Story, an eighteenth
century Quaker, said of the
Christian faith, 'The unity of
Christians never did nor ever will
or can stand in uniformity of
thought or opinion, but in Christian
love only.' Communication
amongst all men, particularly those
with sincere beliefs is important but
should rest on that mutual respect
and tolerance that embodies the
regard we should all hold for each
other.
My final appeal is to each man -
consider carefully what you are
doing when you scorn, verbally or
physically, the beliefs of another.
Are you in any position to judge?
