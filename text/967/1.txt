Shock horror in Southside halls
By our N e w s Staff
Alarms were raised this week over
safety arrangements in Falmouth
Keogh Hall following allegations of
an incident last Sunday, where a
resident was reportedly exposed to
faulty electrical circuits, leaving
sources worried that College was
taking a cavalier approach to the
safety of students living in halls.
Mr Clinton Comeaux asserts that
he was speaking on the telephone
when he touched a bare, live
junction block and experienced a
mild electric shock. 'As the wires
touched the back plate, sparks flew
across the corridor', he said
yesterday. A n eyewitness reports
hearing an audible cry as the lights
went out, while another says that
Mr Comeaux 'reeled back from the
wall'. The incident was
immediately reported to Richard
Owen, a subwarden, who covered
the offending junctions with posters
and informed the warden, Professor
Geoffrey New. A n immediate
investigation was begun, with
college electricians spending
Monday and Tuesday covering
blocks in Falmouth Keogh Hall, but
not upstairs in Tizard Hall on
staircase one.
Felix understands that when the
incident was reported, some
considerable time after its
occurrence to Messrs Leach and
Guirey of Estates Management,
they were rather shocked, and
claimed that they were not
previously aware of Mr Comeaux's
electrocution. Further controversy
has since arisen due to M r
Comeaux's subsequent denial that
the incident ever occurred, and
Professor New has added to this.
Questioned on Tuesday by Imperial
College News Network (iCNN)
STOIC, Professor New said he had
been informed of an incident
involving a student's accident with
exposed electrical currents, but that
this allegation had since been
withdrawn. Subsequent attempts
made by i C N N to gather
information have drawn a blank,
suggesting that the 'incident' is
merely wild speculation intended to
fuel an outbreak of mass hysteria in
Southside Halls.
When i C N N spoke to Estates
Management, they said that a Safety
Committee sits every term to
discuss matters like this, and
produced a copy of the 'IC
Dangerous Occurrences Report
Form (not causing injury)' that
should be submitted by any student
experiencing such an incident. The
form should be filled in to report
any dangerous incidents occurring
around the campus, but evidence
acquired by iCNN suggests that
knowledge of the existence of this
document is very scarce. This
'After the Fact' approach to
potential hazards within halls of
residence has been condemned as
'foolhardy', as it is implicit that the
extent of faults must be appraised
in terms of risks or injuries arising
from those faults, before any action
is taken to rectify them.
