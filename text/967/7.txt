Get on yer bike Coming soon
Want to win a mountain bike? Read
on! Oxfam are holding a sponsored
cycle ride on Saturday June 26th,
between Chislehurst (that's near
Bromley), and Aylesford. The
round trip is 63 miles, but the less
ambitious among us can opt to do
one leg only - either
London/Aylesford (35 miles) or
t'other way (28 miles). Transport
back to London has been arranged
for the lazier people. Sounds like a
civilized form of torture to me, but
anyone who feels like a little
exercise for a good cause can get
more details either by contacting
Mike Chamberlain via the Rag
Office, or direct by calling Oxfam
on 071 585 0220 (speak to Jim).
Registration is only £3 for students,
so no pleas of poverty, please!
Charity chaos
Now the new committee has been
elected, the Rag Fete has happened
(in a big way!), and exams are
looming even for the biologists, the
Rag Year is beginning to wind
down. The usual round of concerts,
collections and football matches will
continue, and details of any you
might hear of can normally be
found on the Rag Noticeboard (half
way up the stairs on the way to the
Rag Office - for those that don't
know where that is, try the East
staircase off Beit quad.)
Alternatively, you can pop into the
Rag Office itself, or come to one of
the weekly meetings (1.10pm,
Fridays in the Ents Lounge), or
failing all of these, leave a message
in the Rag pigeon hole in the Union
Office. So, no excuses for not
knowing all about forthcoming
events!
At last week's Rag meeting, a
number of charities were voted in
as next year's 'nominated charities'.
But what does being a nominated
charity actually mean? It seems as
if a few people may have been
under the impression that Rag only
collects for the charities it elects
every year. This is not the case at
all! Rag generally collects under
any licence it can get it's little paws
on, regardless of the charity. Well,
that's not quite true, we can at least
afford to choose where and when
we collect! Nominated charities, on
the other hand, are given the
proceeds from Rag events, such as
the Rag Week profits, plus anything
that Rag collects under it's own
name. This means that Rag has the
opportunity to give money to
smaller charities, that can't wangle
themselves a licence or are more
difficult to collect for (would you
give money to a charity you'd never
heard of?), as well as collecting for
large charities like Mencap and
Oxfam. All the charities elected for
next year are big and well- known
- this may be because these are the
charities you lot really want to
support, or may be because we
Raggies didn't explain the
difference between nominated
charities, and those we collect on
the street for. So, we are rerunning
the elections to give you a chance
to say where you really want your
money to go. The form below lists
'small' charities on the left, and
'big' ones on the right; bring it
along to the meeting this Friday,
and have you say.
FREE
FLIGHTS
John Grooms Flag Day, on June
5th, is the perfect opportunity for
those of us too poor to afford a
holiday this summer. The charity,
which works with and for disabled
people, helping them to live life to
the full, is offering a voucher for
two free flights to anybody
collecting over £130. Rag has opted
to collect in tube stations on the day,
so that any of you wanting to collect
can not only do so regardless of the
weather, but also stand a very good
chance of raising the required
amount. So what are you waiting
for? Start planning your holiday
now! Destinations include Florence
and Paris for a start - I honestly
can't remember the rest, but they're
a lot more exotic. Alternatively, if
you fancy collecting a bit of dosh,
but can't make it on the 5th of June,
then there are twenty tickets to the
Autoglass Trophy match at
Wembley tomorrow, which is
between Port Vale and Stockport.
