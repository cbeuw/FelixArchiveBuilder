Fatherland
by Robert Harris
Robert Harris has a distinguished
pedigree. His factual books were
first class - the outrage of Bernard
Ingham, Yorkshire rasputin
extraordinaire, being testament to
that. A sympathetic, understanding
book on the Welsh chat- show host
and media star, Neil Kinnock, did
not bar Harris from become a
scribbler on Britain's biggest
tabloid, the Sunday Times. Robert
Harris is a good egg, slightly
hard-boiled.
The birth and delivery of his first
novel was well anticipated. (Mr
Ingham would dispute that
Fatherland was the first work of
fiction, but no matter). Indeed it
was well-hyped. Harris appeared on
the pseudo-intellectual Richard
Litdejohn programme. I am pleased
to report that the book lived up to
the hype. It's a gripping read.
It may have helped if chapter one
had developed at a slighter faster
rate. The first two paragraphs are
supposed to describe a lake, but the
lakeside location doesn't really
seem to sink in until paragraph six
or later. The writing on page one
could have been tighter, more
descriptive. (Yes, I did read beyond
page 1, OK?)
Harris mocks gently. The
suspension of reality needed for this
book is considerable. Set in 1964,
it demands the acceptance of
nothing less than a German victory
in the Second World War, a victory
attained after suing for peace with
Britain in 1944. Alan 'who the
fuck's Michael?' Clark will note
that the peace was not with
Churchill, who had fled to Canada
"along with the rest of his
warmongers."
Sometimes, Harris tweaks the
suspension and grasp of history. By
the simple device of the newspaper
(the eternal historian, M r
Davidson), he predicts his answer
to the eternal 'What if...' question.
Dateline 1964: "In London, it had
been announced that King Edward
was to pay a state visit to the
R e i c h . " King Edward! Had
Elizabeth's father not died yet? No,
hold on, he was George. Edward
was his brother.... the one who
abdicated in 1936, and then paid a
state visit to Nazi Germany in 1937,
introduced by Gobbels as the real
King of England. Who's that one in
the skirt? A h yes, Queen Wallis.
Elizabeth is also in Canada. One
presumes that a certain Prince,
Felix 967
alleged father of suspected
Innishowen illegitimates, was also
there.
In the imaginary 1964, America
was at peace, with Germany at
least, since 1946. No race riots, and
President Kennedy still alive. The
75 year old President Joseph P
Kennedy, that is, about to make a
state visit to the Reich, in the
interests of detente. Strangely,
Harris retains the historic fact of the
Cold War, not this time between
partners and World War Two
victors USA and USSR, but instead
an uneasy truce between the USA
and Germany.
Now for the plot synopsis. The
story hangs on the holocaust,
general German ignorance of it, and
the systematic death of the 14 that
did know, those that attended the
Wannsee conference. This leaves
Hitler as the sole surviving keeper
of the knowledge. And, of course,
the state visit of Kennedy.
Incidentally, Joseph P Kennedy,
"appeaser, anti-Semite, gangster
and sonofabitch," was US
Ambassador to the Court of St
James (ie Britain) in 1938. In this
role, Kennedy told the German
ambassador to London that the
Jewish question was of great
importance to the American-
German relationship. German
diplomatic cables from 13 June
1938 record that 'in this connection,
the (American) Ambassador stated
it was not so much the fact that we
(Germany) wanted to get rid of the
Jews that was harmful, but rather
the loud clamour which
accompanied this.' Kennedy later
added that a large section of the
American population had an
'understanding' of the German
'attitude' towards the Jews. Always
willing to cherish all people equally,
was Kennedy.
The German defeat allowed for
the discovery of the Nazi horror.
Did the Germans know? Some
guards at the concentration camps,
the KZs hinted: "The water in the
shower rooms must be very hot
today, since they shout so loudly."
What about those remaining in the
Fatherland? " O f course you knew!
You knew every time someone
made a joke about going East. We
knew when we moved into their
houses, when we took over their
property, their jobs".

A play about putting on a play. This
is an Alan Bates vehicle in which
he plays an actor who is egocentric,
a caricature. He and his family
undertake a tour of the provinces,
putting on shows in small villages.
We see the preparation for just one
of these evenings. Bruscon, played
by Bates passes time by
philosophising at length about his
family, the play, the world and life
in general without reaching any
particular conclusion. As writer,
director and performer of the
comedy, Bruscon is naturally
convinced that it is a masterpiece,
comparing it to Shakespeare and
Voltaire. It contains world leaders
from history: Caesar, Matternich
(19th century German chancellor),
eighteen year old black teenager is
stabbed to death by a gang of white
youths, in an area where the British
National Party has recently set up
an office.
" 'Your interest or lack of it is
beside the point.' said the Kripo
officer."

Hitler, Churchill and, as for
women, Churchill's wife and Marie
Curie.
Although six actors appear in the
play, five of them get five per cent
of the lines. The other 95 % goes to
Bates who uses his fellow thesps
virtually as props. Bates' portrayal
of The Showman is excellent, he
overacts to the best of his ability.
The others do not get given the
chance to develop their characters
and are there merely to highlight the
character of Bruscon.
I found the play fairly dull.
Admittedly there were some funny
lines, and some of the 'luvvies' in
the audience with me hardly
stopped laughing, so I suppose it
can't have been that bad. If you're
a 'luvvie' go for it, but it's not my
cup of tea.
