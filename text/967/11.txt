council is reconsidering awarding
an events licence, due to an alleged
abuse of Fire Regulations. This
time the entrance to a New Year's
Eve party in the Scala was locked
and manned. According to fire
inspectors, who dropped in for a
surprise visit during the party, this
constitutes blocking a fire exit. To
the Scala it stops them putting on
their most profitable 'multimedia
events', fashion shows and parties.
The chances of raising the money
to repay the 'The Clockwork
Orange' action now come solely
from the 'Save the Scala fund', set
up when legal case was first
pending.
Helen argues that the door had to
be locked, due to the residual
problems of the Kings Cross area.
We've always had prostitutes, but
the drug dealers have become a real
problem, she continued. Drug
dealing at the entrance to the cinema
is a regular event. Staff try and get
those involved to move on without
resorting to the police, but there is
little success. Occasionally violence
spills over from the street: In one
case the victim of a chase ran up
into the foyer of the cinema only to
be caught there, when a Scala
patron tried to step in and help,
injuries occurred. If this were not
enough the Landlord who owns the
lease on the building is putting the
rent up threefold. Things are
beginning to look miserable for the
Scala.
Why has the local council been
so stringent on the Cinema? Helen
has strong opinions on this question:
She believes the plans to put the
Channel tunnel rail-link at Kings
Cross means an end to the whole
area. The plans show the rail-link
going straight across the site where
the Scala now stands. They are
going to do the same thing as in
Docklands, run it down, so when
the developers buy it up it will be
a blessing, she commented.
But all the same, fund raising
continues. It is posible to buy
oranges in the Scala foyer for £1,
most of the profits go to the Save
the Scala fund, 'Droog in the Dock'
T shirts are available and the Scala
Orange Ball takes place next
Thursday 27th May. The Orange
Ball will include a fashion show,
Celebrity compere and what is
described as a 'non-stop party'. Due
to the previously mentioned ban,
the event will be held in Cafe de
Paris, Coventry St, W l . Tickets
have to be bought in advance and
cost £15. And if you want to know,
the Scala Cinema club is about 5
mins walk from Kings Cross tube
at 275-277 Pentonville Road.
