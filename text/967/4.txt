21 May 1993 Felix 967
Musos slammed! Fame at last
Dear Editor,
Many a time I have shied away
from complaining about Felix
music reviews, mainly because they
leave me questioning whether I
know anything about current
releases.
I have two main grievances to air:
Firstly, I am in possession of a
considerable music collection,
albeit of mainstream tendency, and
I beleive that I am well above
average in the IC musically
educated department. Why then,
have I not heard the names, even,
of most of the groups reviewed in
Felix? None of my flatmates have
heard of any of them! Surely it
would not be beyond the capabilities
of the journalists to review an album
by a group we may have heard of,
or even material that we might wish
to purchase.
It may show off a deep
knowledge of music trivia to be able
to describe 'An Epileptic Jellybean'
as being the best thing since
'Wibble', but for the most of us, the
review's irrelevance is obviously
compounded when we know neither
band. Picture a person trying to
explain what an orange is like, to
an Eskimo, by saying that it's like
a grapefruit, only smaller.
Secondly, I am the first to admit
that my grammar is suspect, but I
am tired of attempting to glean the
intended meaning from between
seemingly random punctuation and
incomplete sentences. If I can get
the meaning then mostly it's not
even about the album under review.
The review ultimately fails to tell
me much about the songs on the
album, surely the main point of the
review! I do not want to cramp
anyone's style but it's downright
annoying when a music review tells
us more about the writer's alter ego
(eg Lise Yates, RIP) than the music.
This is not meant to start a war
of words, but, HIGHBROW,
P R E T E N T I O U S M U S I C
JOURNALISTS risk your self-
esteem and review something that's
going to get into the top 20 album
chart every now and again, 'ey?
Yours sincerely,
Martin Godet, Civ Eng 2.
Dear Jonty,
Now that I have achieved
worldwide fame after appearing on
the front cover of Felix juggling
torches (Felix 966), I thought I
would use my celebrity status to
mention that we are trying to start
a circus skills society for next year.
At the moment we have informal
practice in the Union Lounge on
Wednesday at about 3.00pm.
If you are interested, either
contact me or come along on
Wednesday.
Yours sincerely,
Simon Haynes, Elec Eng 1.
A little undermining
Dear Jonty,
Re: Union Restructuring.
It seems to me that the current
ideas for restructuring the Union
have absolutely no effect on, and
will be of no use to the members of
the general student body.
There is no mention of
improvement of services or
representation which, in my
opinion, is the role of the Student
Union.
This is reflected from the fact that
there has been no student
consultation, nor is there likely to
be.
Has this just been an excuse for
the sabbaticals to avoid doing any
useful work?
Yours sincerely,
Gina Mortley, MRE 2.
