of Hong Kong and Taiwan with
China.
This shift in attitude comes from
the urgent situation concerning
human rights violations, Chinese
'population transfer', increasing
environmental damage and most
importantly the 'intentional of
unintentional cultural genocide'. A
major concern is to save Tibet's
unique culture.
Deng Xiaoping, China's leader,
is now willing to discuss anything
except complete independence, so
with both sides willing to accept a
'one country, two systems'
approach, talks look promising.
However, the success depends upon
China's final interpretation of this
approach. On the question of full
independence the Dalai Lama says
that 'ultimately the Tibetan people
have the right to decide'.
In the meeting with Douglas
Hurd, the Foreign Secretary told the
Dalai Lama that he would speak out
his concern over human rights and
Chinese 'population transfer' into
Tibet. After many years of
indifference, this would seem to
indicate the British Government
adopting a more favourable position
- in the past Britain has been
reluctant to upset the Chinese
because of Hong Kong. Douglas
Hurd also voiced his support for
Tibetan talks with China 'without

pre-conditions'.
The Tibetan leader said that he
supports a boycott of Chinese goods
under certain conditions, because

although 'China are very eager to
join the mainstream of the world
community in the economic field,
this is not sufficient; democracy and
freedom are even more important
and therefore the world community
have a moral and practical
responsibility. It is important that
China is brought into the
mainstream of democracy and in
order to develop democracy more
quickly pressure is needed mainly
in the economic field'.
The Dalai Lama visited
Washington last month, and
engaged in talks concerning
'population transfer' and China's
'Most Favoured Nation' status with
the US, which is up for renewal in
June. Conditions on China are
likely to be imposed.
It is imperative to remember that
we are not only talking of justice,
human rights and equality, but of
a people entitled to their country.
The Chinese
have caused
destruction of
Tibet's natural
resources.
Tibet has no oil, but it has its own
culture; language, beliefs and
customs. It is a nation in its own
right and as such its people have the
right to their freedom just as we are
free to practice our cultures.
When finally, nine years after the
invasion, the United Nations passed
a resolution criticising the denial of
human rights in Tibet, Britain
refused to give its support because
'Action on a political side did not
seem profitable' (British Official at
the UN).
Britain's stand has since changed
a little - this is due to the continuing
effort of the Dalai Lama, the
Tibetan organisations, those who
support Tibet and those who are
willing to make a stand; those who
will pressurise their Government
and those who write to the MPs.
This pressure must continue.
It would certainly be naive to
assume that you or I could change
the world, but together we could
make a difference.
I would like to end with a few
words from the Dalai Lama's Nobel
Peace Prize acceptance speech,
'The problems we face today,
violent conflicts, destruction of
nature, poverty, hunger and so on,
are human-createdproblems which
can be resolved through human
effect, understanding, and the
development of a sense of
brotherhood and sisterhood. We
need to cultivate a universal
responsibility for one another and
the planet we share. Although I
have found my own Buddhist
religion helpful in generating love
and compassion, evenfor those we
consider our enemies, I am
convinced that everyone can
develop a good heart and a sense
of universal responsibility with or
without religion'. With these words
in mind I urge you to please give
your support.
