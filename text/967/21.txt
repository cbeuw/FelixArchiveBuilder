Since I am not Jewish, I cannot
really give a valid comment on the
authenticity of this play. But
comparing it to all the stereotypes
that are portrayed on the TV, this
is accurate, if anything, more
accurate than say Maureen
Lipman's Beattie.
The audience, who are addressed
directly by the two
comediennes/actresses, are led
through the lives of two Jewish
women, from their gestation in their
mother's womb until the present
day. Along the way, almost every

Even if you've never heard of
Gyorgy Ligeti, you've probably
heard some of his music: the
haunting Lux aetema was abducted
by Stanley Kubrick and used in
2001. But another important side to
Ligeti's character is a keen sense of
the ridiculous; the overture to his
opera Le Grand Macabre is scored
for 12 motor horns, and he once
wrote a piece for 100 metronomes.
He did not, as far as I know,
develop this very John Cage-esque
idea by writing a sequel for 100
prepared metronomes, stuffed with
'nightmare' that is possible, occurs.
This includes spots, big boobs (this
was during the sixties when having
no bust was fashionable) and
needing to see a psychiatrist.
This play is very good and very
funny. Both comediennes/actresses
play all the parts by donning various
accesories and clothes, and they do
it extremely well. I loved the
nostalgia of the 'hippy' era (even
though I wasn't born then!) and the
unpatronising manner of the
comediennes/actresses.
Quality work.

'Psst!.. .psst!' hissed soloist Hakan
Hardenberger, in between playing
his trumpet, while the orchestra
rustled and chanted. Like the
metronomes, probably more fun to
hear about than to hear.

Restaurant
London's newest, boldest restaurant
opened this weeek; Stallone, Willis
and Schwarzeneger's entrance into
Europe is based on a formula
proven in America, and if last
Friday's preview is anything to go
by, it is going to be a huge success.
Picture the scene, as the guests
begin to arrive outside the as yet
half-built 'entertainment complex'
(as described by the unashamedly
American invitation)...
S C E N E 1: 9.30pm . A
pavement. Stage left, a drunk
staggers past, singing. A queue of
restiess extras, in anticipation of
free food and drink, eye the
unfinished set suspiciously. In the
background, builders scale the
scaffolding and a concrete mixer
grinds ominously.
S C E N E 2: 10pm. No change,
bar the increasingly impatient and
ever expanding, though seemingly
stationary, line of 'guests' snaking
back towards Leicester Square.
SCENE 3:10.30pm. Our heroes
(us, at last!) finally reach the
doorway - champagne and warmth,
albeit only on a stairway. Hold onto
your seats, ladies and gentlemen,
the show has begun.
S C E N E 4: 11pm. Our heroes
stand in the (almost completed) bar
area, looking suitably impressed.
The building site outside belied a
lavish and nearly finished interior!
.. .but to be a little more serious.
If you can't afford the prices, go
and queue anyway, you won't be
disappointed - Planet Hollywood
has a queue with potential. Once
inside, everywhere you look is
covered with original movie props,
from Star Wars to Sound of Music,
and Freddie's nightmarish glove!

And itjust keeps getting better. The
basics are, well, rather plush; the
wash rooms contain all the usual
furniture, plus cigarettes, matches,
razors, makeup, aftershaves,
perfumes, nail varnish, even contact
lens solutions! (Plus an added extra
for the ladies - Eddy, though you
must 'accidentally' enter the gents
to get a glimpse of him!). And it's
all for free.
Wherever you sit, there is plenty
to look at (so no need to worry who
you go with!); the staff are friendly
and helpful - kind of American
without the 'Have a Nice Da-ay!'.
As a free ride, we were handed an
envelope containing our 'selections'
from the menu (after all, this was
as much a dress rehearsal for the
cast and crew than for our benefit),
but both carnivores and vegetables
are amply catered for. We 'chose'
nachos and pizza bread for our
starters, both were excellent, and
like the main courses, worth every
penny that we charged to our
'Planet Hollywood Mastercard'.
When a simple cheeseburger is
more like a way of life, and even
a white chocolate shake is made
with crushed M & M s , you know
you're somewhere special.
Surprisingly enough, the prices
aren't prohibitive - a meal, with
starter, a main course, two drinks,
two coffees and a shared shake, was
little over £16. The one and only
disappointment? The original
Starship Enterprise model wasn't
put on display until Saturday.
F I N A L S C E N E : 1pm Our
heroes, bursting at the seams,
stagger downstairs, casting last
longing glances over their
shoulders, with every intention of
returning. Exit stage right, for the
night bus home.
