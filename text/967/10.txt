Between a rock and a hard place
As London's quirkyest cinema totters from one disaster to another, Jonty
Beavan asks, how did the Scala get into so much trouble?
The Scala cinema club in King's
Cross looks like it has fallen off the
set of a strangely inverted horror
movie: It stands tall, white and Art
Decor, like the home of an
unusually benevolent Boris Karloff,
in the wasteland of rotting buildings
that surround North East London's
main railway stations.
I approached the building, pushed
open the flimsy glass doors and
announced myself to the suspicious
wraith behind the desk. Pausing for
a moment he picked up a phone and
described me to my waiting
interviewee as: 'Another one to see
Helen'. He then directed me to the
top of the building: 'Keep going up
and it's on the left'.
Quite how far up I didn't realise,
stopping in the foyer of the actual
cinema to regain my sense of
direction, I notice a change. M y
kindly, but unseen vampiric host
had been overcome with a bout of
psychedelia. The foyer wall swirled
with primary colours, symbols of
the illuminati and whirlpools of
light. Pausing only for a moment
longer to adjust back to reality, I
climbed further up the dingy marble
stairwell.
Eventually the stairs ran out and
a cat guarded the only doorway.
Slightly relieved that the animal was
not in any way black, I crouched
down and tried to make friends with
it. This was the source of some
confusion to the people sitting
within the room. They had expected
that they were to be interviewed,
not their pets.
After making a rather hurried and
confused explanation, I was
introduced to Helen De Witte and
Alex Fenner, the Programmer and
General Manager of the Scala Club.
Helen was plump, had short, tinted
hair and did all the talking. Alex
stayed quiet, answered the phones
and only showed an interest when
we discussed the history and
structure of the cinema. Much to
my disappointment their office had
a relaxed, cluttered appeal, with
cats wandering in and out at
random. Nothing could be further
from the imagined shadowy
chambers of a sinister monster. I
felt cheated.
Since 1981 the Scala's home has
been King's Cross. This most
peculiar of film clubs moved here
after the lease on its Tottenham
Street cinema, which it had
occupied since the early fifties, ran
out. The Landlord of that place felt
that he would get a better deal
renting to an up and coming T V
station called Channel 4. The Scala
building had always been a cinema
since the 1920's. Now the Circle is
the Scala club with the Stalls
converted into a snooker hall.
First Helen explained the
principle behind the Club. Her
description of the aims of the Scala
were, to show 'art or marginal'
films, but did not fully explaining
what that meant. Distinct from
many of London's other repertory
cinemas, she classified the audience
as 'fans'. People would come from
all over London to see a film at the
Scala, she stated. It is not like the
Electric (another cinema in Notting
Hill) where the audience is local,
the people here are working class
and we don't really concern them.
The Scala has a reputation for a
showing the gay and lesbian films.
Sandra Bernhardt and Derek
Jarman have made personal
appearances and Jean Genet films
are a regular feature. Other
favourites for the Scala bill are;
Hong Kong movies, Exploitation,
Art films and, of course, horror.
We get lots of gore hounds here,
commented Helen; I shuffled
uncomfortably, being rather fond of
the odd bloodthirsty stretch of
celuloid.
Other delights that the Scala
revels in are the 'all-nighters'. For
about £5, an enthusiastic moviegoer
can watch a selection of up to five
films through the night. Along with
this, seasons of the less well known
directors are shown. This also
makes the Scala distinct, it is
unafraid to play the films other
cinemas would shrink from. In a
world dominated by big budget
Hollywood films, the Scala displays
an alternative lifestyle that is
refreshing, if only because it is
different.
Being radical and risque has
almost been the downfall of the film
house. April 1st 1992 the Scala
cinema played an unadvertised
showing of Stanley Kubrick's 'The
Clockwork Orange' about seventy
people attended. Twenty five years
ago, Kubrick banned his creation
because fans of the film copied the
thugglsh behaviour of the main
character. The then programme
manager of the Scala, Jane Gyles
was aware of the ban, but did not
know that the full power of the law
would enforce it. After the
showing, a prosecution was brought
against the Scala by the Federation
of Copyright Theft. Warner
Brothers, the owners of the
copyright for the Clockwork
Orange, added to the sense of
goodwill by blocking the Scala from
using any of the other films under
their licence.
The court case was resolved this
March: Jane Gyles was given a one
year suspended sentence, the
cinema was fined £1000 for
infringement of copyright, but the
costs of the case were £10,000. All
these fines have to be meet by the
cinema. Needless to say Jane Gyles
is no longer employed as
Programmer for the Scala.
