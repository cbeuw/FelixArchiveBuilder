Wild West-Soundtrack
One of the most dubious, money-
spinning wifes of the Music
Industry is the Film Soundtrack.
The theory goes, get one glossy
single released and then fdl the rest
of the time up with lacklustre
instrumentals, which may or may
not have been in the actual film.
The only other option is to have a
film about music so the obligatory
concert, jukebox or radio scene can
offer an opportunity to play the
soundtrack in the actual context of
the plot. Think back to the
'Bohemian Rhapsody' in Wayne's
World. A scary business.
Well, 'Wild West' is thankfully
of the latter category. The
juxtaposition of an Asian Country
and Western band's search for fame
and fortune is the vehicle used to
include a standard collection of
songs from the so-called New
Country wave of the mid-80's.
Seminal names such as Steve Earle,
Nanci Griffith and Dwight Yoakam
provide the main firepower.
The album itself is an interesting
mix of cover and original versions,
but really this only highlights the
differences between the have and
have-nots. In comparing Steve
Earle to Naveen Andrews who
covers two songs, it becomes
almost embarrassing. The point of
Country music is the feeling that the
singer has raked around in the dirt
themselves, look at the greats like
Patsy Cline and Hank Williams.
Even if we did know that Steve
Earle has four Harley-sized
motorbikes, a Hollywood house etc,
he can still sing as if he were a
wasted farm labourer looking
through whisky pickled pupils. It's
not that Andrew's can't sing, he
doesn't seem to summon up the
necessary character. The only
working cover is Griffith's 'Anyone
can be Somebody's Fool' sung by
Rebecca Price. A song so whistful
and pretty, it defies anyone more
sensitive than the Sex Pistols to
make a decent stab of it.
The soundtrack syndrome rears
high towards the end though, as a
couple of Asian tracks, one of
which is delightfully called the
'Supermarket Theme' are tacked
on. I guess in the film's context it
all fits in but the whole album really
sounds like the product of a quick
sortie around a musical Sainsbury's;
a tin of this, a pound of that, put it
Marc Almond: 12 Years of
Tears
Yeah, alright, this has been out for
some time, hasn't it? Sorry, ok?
Clerical errors and all that. You
know how it is. Sometimes you
have a c.d. sitting in your collection
for weeks on end, you know, and
you just forget to review it,
probably. I suppose this means
you'll never trust us again, doesn't
it? Not that you ever did...
'12 Years of Tears' is a live
recording taken from the divine
Marc's performance at the Royal
Albert Hall late last year, and
though I have a carefully-nursed
Felix 967
loathing for 'live' albums, I'm
rather taken with this. The
parisienne threads of decaying
glamour that have permeated his
every recording, from 'Torch' and
'Tainted Love', through 'Waifs and
Strays', 'Mother Fist' and 'Stories
of Johnny', up to and beyond
'Jacques' and 'Jacky', find their
home in the orchestrations and the
architecture of the Victorian blob up
the road. This is Gloria Swanson
doing 'Sunset Boulevard' in cabaret
with her face caked in make-up, her
head full of crystal meth, and her
lace costume patterned with sherry
stains. And not a mention of.

sucking cocks either (which is
almost, curiously, disappointing). If
you haven't bought this already, it's
high time you did. Go on. Dig out
your velvet, dig out your frilled
shirt. Don't blow the dust off, just
slap on the rouge and scarlet
lipstick. Fuck off, Morrissey, fuck
off, Brett. I'm going to dream of
fading movie queens.

Hello. Is that alright? I'm quite nervous, 'cause I've
never done this sort of thing before. My name's
Reynaud, Reynaud McDestine actually, but you can

bunny piss. I like music too, but not the sort of nasty
stuff young Donny listens to. I like Glen Campbell

The overall outcome is a poor
reflection on the potential of the
parts.

bearing all the legacies of the
Electronic project, 'Republic' is
obviously New Order (no-one else
would dare reproduce Peter Hook's
bass sound), but a New Order with
an obviously lighter touch. A friend
reckons they're running out of
ideas, and I suppose he's right to an
extent; they are certainly a lot more
mellow, but the idea of New Order
being mellow is itself quite a
perverse and edgy notion. And
'Republic' is a genuinely inspiring
record, one is even tempted to go
The Moon Seven Times: The
Moon Seven Times
This is the perfect album to revise
to - it will drown out the traffic
noise quite nicely (Hmm... bored -
sic. Ed), but there's nothing catchy,
nothing interesting (ho hum.
Haven't you ever heard of
punctuation? - sic. Ed), to distract
you.
The vocalist (Lynn Canfield) has
a very nice voice - a bit like
Suzanne Vega -
and (this isn't fun, you know,
having to type out other people's
reviews - sic. Ed) they've written
a few nice songs to sing (anything
as far as to say it's 'uplifting'.
They've roped in that most
accessible of producers, too, in the
form of Stephen Hague, to add a
little polish to the product. It's
probably going to be huge. Even
huger.
I never doubted that they would be
back.
Good job, too.

Really. 'Nice' is not in a critic's
vocabulary. 'Sleek and steamy
motherfucker' is. Didn't they teach
you anything at hack school? - sic.

suppose you could manage another

This is a very nice piece of work
(oh, you can - you know who). It's
over seventy minutes long, so it's
good value for money. Erm...
