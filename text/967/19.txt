Talking, The Rhythm-ites, and
some others probably. Oh yeah,
Suede and Sharkboy'
J - 'Who was the best, and who
was the worst, and why?'
G - 'Well, the worst was
definitely 3 1/2 Minutes, I never see
them deliberately, they sort of
follow me. They were at
Strangelove, being loud and
shouting 'Julian, Julian'. The lead
singer wears make-up, and they've
got this really contrived image.
They suck, basically...'
'...The best was either:
Molly Half Head, because they
have this extraordinarily dour
sound, and feel a bit like Joy
Division, or Still Lives Talking,
because I know them, and Ralph
used to be the bassist'.
J - 'who's Ralph?'
G - 'Oh! If you don't know
Ralph, you don't know anyone'
(McCord points across the melee to
The Hard Yakka himself.
Greenwood nods wisely)
J - 'So what are your favourite
bands?'
G - 'Smiths, Joy Division, The
Cure, Radiohead, The The, Billy
Bragg'
J - 'Best and worst lyrics?'
G - 'And the pain was enough/to
make a shy bald buddhist
reflect/and plan a mass murder' by
Morrissey (He's done better than
that - sic. Ed)
'You're a watersign, I'm an
airsign/ too Siamese to taKe the
leaves from those trees' by Brett
(And he's done worse - sic. Ed)
J - 'Do you need to read a lot to
be a journalist?'
G - 'No, but most do anyway.
Mind you, I'm not a proper
journalist, so I don't know'
J - 'Oh, you seem to know what
you're talking about (this is
outrageous! - sic. Ed)
G - 'I like to give that impression.
Pop is dead, right?'

J - 'Fuckin' A . Do you like the
new single then?'
G - 'No, not much'
J - 'Why?'
G - 'It doesn't work on record.
It's quite good live, but it's a bit of
a token effort. It could be a
Kingmaker song'
J - 'Don't you like Kingmaker
then?'
G - T was well into them a couple
of years ago, but they're more
annoying than entertaining now'
J - 'Who are your heroes?'
G - 'Mark E Smith, Albert
Camus, Morrissey, Jack Charlton,
Ian Curtis, Desert Orchid'
J - 'Who's going to win the cup?'
G - 'Arsenal or Sheffield
Wednesday'
J - 'Who do you support?'
G - 'I grew up minking they were
called Brighton & Hove Albion Nil.
Apparently they are'
J - 'Not a good season, then?'
G - 'No'
J - 'Are you going to have sex
tonight?'
G - 'Not if I can help it'
Great, people. That's a wrap,
then. What d'you reckon, boss? Not
bad, was it? for a complete load of
bullshit, anyway. Why isn't there
a real interview, Glyph? did you
shit your pants when confronted by
your fave stars, or what? ?
Well, kids. One thing's for sure.
Radiohead are here, and they've
brought their haircuts with them.
Lucky fucking us, eh?
You! Yes, you. Stop thinking about

Alright, so it's just a gig review and
a 12" review, but to all intents and
purposes, it's a feature. You
should've seen the ones we nearly
did, 'the reviews that never were'
for instance, or 'the sad old carrot
suckers special' (curiously enough,
both of these feature the same Sting
review).

Warning: The word 'sex' may
appear in liberal quantities in the
following review.
Slinky and kinky, Eat are sex on
a stage. 'Skin! Skin!' shout the
voyeuristic kids. And a girl with
Levitation scrawled on her arms
looks mournfully at Ange Doolittle
as he announces that band's demise,
the previous, precious night. (In-
band bickering, no doubt). 'What
have you got written on your arm,
little girl?'

Heralding a new album next month,
and a string of live shows and T V
appearances 'Bleed Me White' is
Eat's catchiest single yet. More
swell than 'Bellytown', or
glistening than 'Golden Egg', more
sinful than 'Shame', of which the
B-side features a rehashed version
with vocals by Jesus Jones' Mike
Edwards. International Bright
Young Things, indeed.

sweet Eat, sweaty and sticky and
slurpy and stains on the sheets.
Ange flashes a 'Befluffy' shirt, to
the fans and photographers. 'Skin!
Skin!'. The girl sits at the feet of
the singer on the edge of the stage,
and she smiles.
More songs, more sweat, Eat in
the heat of the pit, the temperature
throng: 'Skin! Skin!', demanding
the shirt on the sexgod's back. And
they crush the girl as she clings
desperately to his hand.
Encore! Eat is murder 'Skin!
Skin' and the meat market must be
satiated. 'You'll get your skin, but
first, you'll get your
shame!'...weird sounds set your
mind in a fever. And the girl stares
skyward as the lead-singer dives
above her into the crowd.
Eat: Sex Sex Sex Sex Sex.
Easi Style.
