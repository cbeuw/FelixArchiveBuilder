COMMENT
The rent guarantor trap
College ignores the fact that many students struggle to afford rented accommodation

U
nknown to many
home students, there
is an unholy pitfall
for those trying to
find accommodation without a
guarantor.
This not only applies to
international students but also
home students from low income
backgrounds. Without an
appropriate guarantor, landlords see
fit to demand rent in batches of six
months as well as a huge deposit.
The vast amount of money that
this adds up to has to be paid upfront
in one go,otherwise the unfortunate
student will have nowhere to stay.
This is completely unacceptable,
particularly in the turbulent London
housing market, where costs add up
to incomprehensible amounts.
Without a UK guarantor, and
already paying huge fees, many
international students end up taking
out loans to afford the ridiculous
cost of having a roof over their head.
Imperial is the most international
university in the UK; surely we
should be catering to this need more
than anyone else.
But that is not the case – other
universities such as SOAS and UCL
have successfully implemented
schemes where the university
acts as a rent guarantor for any
student in need. The system works
by the university acting as a UK
guarantor for the student,taking the
uncertainty and risk away from the
landlord.Therefore students can pay
rent one month at a time, the way
it should be. This is clearly a system
that works and relives so much
stress for so many students. Why
then has it not been implemented
here at Imperial?
This is not a new issue, this is an
ongoing problem. Many students
have expressed concern over the
inaction of College and their
negligence. In an increasingly
erratic world, where college life is
getting more stressful and tougher,
it is the College’s responsibility
to ensure life for students is as
easy and stress-free as possible
without the already stressful year
of exams and coursework. Finding
accommodation should be simple
and financially possible, not a wild
gamble and a stab in the dark.

Y
ear on year, students put
themselves forward as
candidates for leadership
positions in the Union
because they feel strongly that
things need to change, and they
think that their ideas and their
drive can help implement that.They
campaign, putting their faces and
ideas out there, and, in the case of
the sabbatical officers, some earn
themselves a job at the end of it.But
is this fair?
We want the people in charge
of running the Union to be the
best possible people for the job,
but we never question whether the
method of electing them is really
achieving that. For some roles, it
might be the case that the most
outgoing and personable person,
who is most willing to neglect their
degree for a fortnight to campaign,
is the best person for the job. But
for other roles, do we miss out on
the candidates who might perform
best in the role because we’re too
distracted by the bells, whistles
and pretty people? Do we vote for
candidates because they fit our view
of what a responsible person looks
like? Do we keep people out of
roles because we have a fixed idea
of who would be appropriate in that
position?
I understand that a huge part
of getting a job is being able to
present yourself well. But in the
“real world”, job applications are
gender-blind, sometimes name-
blind, and certainly don’t involve
having the faces of the candidate
plastered all over the workplace of
the interviewers for two weeks. For
any other job, candidates would be
judged on their ideas, experience,
and qualifications (which would be
somewhat verified), instead of how
many friends they have to vote for
them, and how much people like
looking at them during lecture
shout-outs.
Imperial students aren’t engaged
enough in Union politics – the
inner workings of which are opaque
at best – to read the manifesto of
every candidate, or to know what
campaign promises are achievable or
realistic. All the average student has
to go on is how trustworthy their
faces are,and how convincingly they
can lie.
If we want our student union to
truly represent us and to be run by
the best candidates, we owe it to
ourselves to consider the capabilities
of each and every candidate, and
look beyond who is most charming.
