Robot or Human?
W
hat does it mean
to be a human?
That’s the question
Channel 4’s sci-
fi show Humans dances around.
Created by Sam Vincent and
Jonathan Brackley, this show tells a
compelling story with multi-layered
characters.
Based on an original Swedish
series called ‘Real Humans’, created
by Lars Lundstrom, there’s nothing
particularlynewaboutthepremiseof
Humans, which features ‘synthetic’
humans or robots with artificial
intelligence. For all its imagination,
sci-fi is certainly a genre that recycles
old concepts.The intrigue lies in the
execution and the re-imagining of
them.We’ve certainly seen plenty of
robots wreaking havoc on humanity,
but the show finds a way to bring
something different to a very
familiar conflict.
Humans features a world just like
ours, with the exception that it’s
a world filled with robots, called
synths, who look just like humans.
The synths are part of the society,
performing menial jobs like manual
labour, looking after the elderly,
and even working as prostitutes.
Amongst these mindless robots,
there’s a small group who have
emotions and can think for
themselves. Naturally, this group is
on the run from people who seek to
stop them (or help them?) and they
inadvertently get split up.
The series mostly centres on these
robots trying to find each other,
while at the same time, trying to
deal with the circumstances they
find themselves in. In addition,
there are also human characters
central to the plot. These include,
but are not limited to, the Hawking
family who buy one of the synths,
reprogrammed, a retired old
inventor and a police officer who
dislikes synths with vengeance.
tachycardiac pace that keeps you
on the edge of your seat. The show
is written so that it’s not really
possible to divide the characters
into good or bad. There’s a more
complicated, more realistic, and
frankly more interesting morality to
Humans, where everyone is acting
around the moral grey areas. The
writers are able to nail the real-life
worries and emotional connections
that come when synths are a part of
everyday life.
The show also addresses, but
doesn’t directly answer, questions
relating to having robots in our
everyday life. When machines can
do all the things you can do, then
what’s the point of us? What’s
the purpose in our lives? The teen
character Mattie helps to convey
this well; she believes education
is pointless because eventually the
synths will develop to be faster,
better and cheaper than us. The
show also talks about what it means
to be a human and actually live. Are
emotions inherently a part of us, or
can they be taught and developed?
In one brilliant scene, the synth
Anita says to Laura, the mother of
One of the amazing characteristics
of Humans is that the premise
isn’t really such a big leap or
advancement. AI is being developed
and robots are being modified
as you’re reading this. Whether
the robots will be as pretty as
Gemma Chan as Anita (who’s very
convincing as a semi-humanoid)
remains to be seen. Humans takes
place sometime around now, not in
a technologically advanced future.
It’s a sci-fi show for the non sci-fi
fan; sci-fi that has a foot in sci-fact.
This show is a clever, well
written and high-energy thriller.
It has a breathless urgency and a
her, while the mother and teenage
daughter are suspicious and curious.
Gemma Chan is great as the synth
Anita, conveying a smoothly-
robotic nature with ‘human’qualities
through a compelling and alluring
performance.
Another standout actor is William
Hurt, as Dr. George Millican, an
engineer on the original synth
project and owner of Odi (Will
Tudor), an out-of-date model
that the government is looking to
recycle. But George can’t bear to
part with Odi because he’s come to
feel like family and all the memories
they share. Hurt imbues George
with a sense of loneliness and regret;
he doesn’t like the idea of upgrades
destroying the connections that
families have to their synths. He
also brings humor to the role as
he suffers through his new, no-
nonsense model, Vera, who strictly
monitors his health.
By bringing these kinds of
emotional touches into the episodes,
Vincent and Brackley succeed in
making Humans, well, very human
– concerning itself not only with
the humanity of the real people we
meet, but with the humanity of the
synthetic ones, too. With a plot full
of twists and surprises and dazzling
performances all around, Humans
is an amazing and beautifully made
show. It deserves more attention
than it currently has and is worth a
watch.
