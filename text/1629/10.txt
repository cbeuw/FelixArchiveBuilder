ntil recently, many
saw the netlabel and
electronic collective PC
Music as the future of
pop. However, even after a number
of brilliant, innovative releases
they’ve remained on the fringes.

of his record last year,a collaboration
between SOPHIE and Charli
XCX had been circulating around
the internet for a while.It combined
Charli XCX’s familiar voice with
the sugar coated production of
SOPHIE, creating something truly
futuristic.
This collaboration, ‘Vroom
Vroom’, would end up being the
name of Charli XCX’s new label,
Vroom Vroom Recordings. She
describes it as label where the artists
will be “sharp, potent and deadly”.
The first release on the label, an EP
also called VroomVroom,was released
last week – produced by SOPHIE
and with a guest appearance from
PC Music’s Hannah Diamond.
Starting off full throttle, the EP’s
namesake sees Charli XCX imitate
a car. She sings “Beep Beep” and
“Vroom Vroom” mixed with the
real sounds of an automotive. And
on the chorus she’s fully aware of
her pole position in the race to the
top of pop: “Bitches know they can’t
catch me”. The song is a confident,
and energetic statement of new
lifestyle, having recently moved to
L.A.
‘Paradise’ begins on a chipmunk-
ified chorus, with ethereal tones
reflecting the core lyric: “Tonight,
we’re in paradise”. It soon skitters
into more experimental beats,
with the pops and squeaks which
Charli XCX’s Vroom Vroom Recordings aims to leave a mark on the pop music world
thunderous and explosive, with the
chant “Throw it up” encouraging
club goers.
The ballad-like closer, ‘Secret’, is
the EP’s biggest surprise. It’s snappy
and trappy, with a cheeky “Shh”
emphasising it’s obvious theme.
Many have called PC Music
hyper-consumerist pop, self-
aware in its commercial appeal.
Vroom Vroom is the first sign of the
collective transcending this label;
Charli XCX adds substance and
meaning to their winning electro-
pop formula.
PC Music are branching out and
assimilating. Charli XCX is savvy
of the true future of pop; her next
album, also produced by SOPHIE,
could be her biggest hit yet.

label, might have had a single that
made it onto BBC Radio 1’s‘A-List’,
but he’s failed to capitalise on this
success. Similarly, SOPHIE’s
compilation album, Product, which
was released last year seemed like
a bit of a flop, considering that its
release also coincided with the
launch of a sex toy.
The collective have now started
to look towards mainstream pop to
find their success. Before the debut

to be like Marilyn Monroe: “Take

book Shooting Star: Marilyn

an understatement, ‘Trophy’ is
