T
he question of whether
the arts are a luxury or a
necessity has become one
of the issues surrounding
the ‘Jungle’ refugee camp just
outside Calais.
Over 6000 displaced people from
some of the most violent places
in the world have gathered in the
camp, a collection of makeshift
shelters, home to people from over
20 different countries, from Syria to
Eritrea to Pakistan.
Thelackoforganisedinfrastructure
and aid effort has pushed the camp
into a state of humanitarian crisis,
according to a report conducted
by the University of Birmingham
with the medical charity Medecins
du Monde. Despite the abject
poverty and squalor amongst the
mud, something of a self made
community is emerging. Along
the main street running through
the camp, hairdressers, restaurants,
schools, churches and mosques have

The Good Chance Theatre is aiming to offer escapism to refugees across the camp
sprung up; born out of a necessity or
a hope to carry on as usual despite
the horrific situations the residents
find themselves in. A theatre has
also been set up by the British
playwrights Joe Murphy and Joe
Robertson, supported by the Young
Vic and The Royal Court theatres
and many celebrated figures in
British theatre including Tony
award winning director Stephen
Daldry, and artistic director of The
Royal Court, Vicky Featherstone.
The Good Chance Theatre, which
derives its name from the common
debate amongst the refugees of the
likelihood of crossing The Channel
to Britain on a particular day,was set
up to become a place where refugees
from all the different countries
come together to tell their stories.
Under the geodesic plastic dome of
the theatre,a daily of roster of events
is put on by volunteer artists. These
include music lessons, dance and
acting workshops, English lessons,
and even workshops in specific arts
as varied as circus or clowning. The
Good Chance website declares they
have hosted “poetry slams, stand up
comedy nights, acoustic sets, theatre
performance, rap battle”, providing
escape from the rest of the camp’s
dreariness.

Despite

poverty and
squalor in
the mud, a

is emerging
children living in the Jungle.
Women are outnumbered one to
ten within the camp and do not
stray outside of their family tents for
fear of becoming targets of sexual
violence. Likewise, the camp is a
dangerous place for the hundreds
of unaccompanied minors who
have found their way to Calais but
have become separated from their
family.These most vulnerable of the
refugees find it difficult to make use
of the paltry resources available, for
they are seldom able to leave the
safe spaces. they have created for
themselves.
For this reason, many of the
visiting artists have made it their
mission to draw the women and
children out of their constant fear
and give them an outlet to express
themselves. Recently, Afsaneh Gray,
a playwright associated with The
Gate theatre in Notting Hill, ran
a workshop encouraging the young
refugees to draw scenes from stories
told to them in their childhood. In
his powerful essay about Calais in
The Guardian,Christopher Haydon
describes some of the drawings by
the young children, many featuring
the emblems of the war that has
been ongoing in their native Middle
East for their entire lives; guns,
Chinook helicopters, the threat of
ISIS.
The images, so far removed from
the childhood these kids should’ve
had indicates the burden of mental
health problems in this population.
Most, if not all of the residents
of the Jungle are suffering from
the mental effects of brutal and
close encounters with violence and
war. In most cases, the refugees
are not receiving adequate medical
care for physical ailments, let alone
support for mental health. The
Good Chance Theatre and similar
initiatives may be one of the most
effective ways of tackling the issue.
Art therapy has been shown to be
effective in tackling post traumatic
stress disorder in returning
soldiers, ameliorating aggressive
and depressive tendencies. It is
only reasonable to assume that the
civilians fleeing from those war
zones would benefit from the same
therapies.
Not everyone has been convinced
about the value of the Good Chance
Theatre however. In particular, the
performance of Hamlet by the
touring ‘Globe to Globe’arm of The
Globe theatre became a lightning
rod for controversy.
Critics argue that the residents of
the Jungle camp are living in fear
for their lives, often going without
food, sharing one toilet between
75 people, completely without
washing facilities; a theatre has
no place in such an environment.
Do they have a point? Should
we be talking about food for the
soul when there is a shortage of
food for their bellies? Some might
consider the idea of performing
centuries old theatre to people in
such destitute circumstances to
be very definition of leftist ivory
tower thinking; a peculiar brand
of champagne socialism (“let them
watch Shakespeare”). In Elliot
Eisner’s words such people view the
arts “as nice but not necessary’”.
Yet, it is clear that to the 300
refugees who watched the outdoor
performance, it was a welcome
break from the monotony of life in
the Jungle. One refugee, speaking to
The Guardian, said, “I’ve read the
play in a book but never seen it... It
is good to see theatre, … It is good
to enjoy something”.
Throughout history, in times of
despair, people have sought refuge
and comfort in the arts.
Why else is Verdi performed
to packed out audiences in the
Donetsk Opera House as shellfire
echoes around them? Why else, in
the midst of the darkest days of the
FirstWorldWar, did British soldiers
start publishing and distributing
poems and satire on the front lines
in the ‘Wipers Times’? Indeed, why
else did our earliest ancestors start
scrawling bison on the walls of
Spanish caves when by rights they
should have been more concerned
with the woolly mammoths after
them?
The idea that the arts are a luxury
is a myth that should be readily and
swiftly dispelled. The arts should
not be sequestered away in gilted
galleries, privy only to the privileged
few. The arts more often than not

are utterly necessary to survival
and in maintaining humanity, and
surviving in a desperate situation.
Imagine for a second that you had
braved war, survived sinking boats,
travelled across continents, when
you finally arrived on safe land
would you rather be rescued by the
leftie ‘luvvies’ with their Hamlet
and writing workshops, or the so
called pragmatists who wouldn’t
look beyond a meal a day and bare
necessities? I know which one I’d
choose.

company and others like them are
doing necessary and excellent work,
but they may now face extinction.
Though the theatre is still standing,
the French authorities have begun
demolishing the Jungle; churches
and restaurants have already been
bulldozed along with dozens of
homes. Theoretically the residents,
now twice displaced, should be
rehoused in other parts of the
city, but for many – especially the
500 unaccompanied minors – the
situation remains precarious
It is a striking indictment of
European politics that the people
who have gone to extraordinary
lengths to flee violence and terror
from their own countries find
themselves on the shores of one of
the richest countries in the world
still fearing for their security.
Despite all odds, in face of
Europeangovernmentsthatoscillate
between barely acknowledging the
plight of the refugees and openly
denying their right to seek refuge,
the men, women and children who
have found their way to Calais are
starting to rebuild their lives, but
they need our help.
As with most things, governments
are far behind the mentality of
the citizens, but it is time that
the powers-that-be in Europe
recognise the displaced people, not
as “a bunch of migrants” as David
Cameron so charmingly termed
them, but as human beings, just
like us, deserving of shelter, food,
warmth, and yes, even beauty.
