oting opens today for the
Leadership Elections,
which have seen a record
number of students come
forward for the roles of President
and Deputy President (Welfare).
No one put themselves forward for
the Deputy President (Finance and
Services) role.
The current DPFS, Chris Kaye,
commented on Twitter that this
was because you “can’t improve
on perfection”. He was Deputy
President of Welfare last year.
Students can only take two
sabbatical years.
Our cover this week features the
wannabes who turned up to Meet
the Candidates who were going for
the big hitter positions, including
President, FELIX Editor, and DPs
of Welfare, Clubs & Societies, and
Education.
Although campaigning can be
notoriously stressful, one ex-sabb
told FELIX they “had a great time
because I just wandered round
chatting with my friends, and
persuaded their friends to vote for
me”.
For others, it’s not so easy. An
anonymous candidate told FELIX
that they had only had three hours
of sleep on the night of Meet the
Candidates, after attempting to nab
some extra votes at the post Varsity
ACC.
Some candidates have already
been warned over campaign rule

fter some technical
difficulties around kick
off, ICTV and Imperial
College London’s
evening of candidate-grilling began.
Ex-Union President, Paul
Beaumont, played Jeremy Paxman
on the night. Most would agree his
style was kind, despite asking one
candidate who’d claimed sabbs were
“CV padders”whether this included
the host. The Youtube comment
stream yelped excitedly throughout
the night, with current sabbs,
students from UCL and notable
BNOCS all commenting.
A record number of candidates,
including nine for President and
six for Deputy President (Welfare)
turned up on the night.
A notoriously nerve-wracking
experience, some thrived in the
limelight. 30-second pitches were
forgotten, promotional clothing was
worn and hard hitting questions
were asked, such as: “How do you
spell Rhododendron?”

hitting interviews in the media
basement’s shared studio.
Some of the basement’s sound
issues were made obvious when one
of the FELIX Editor candidates
said if forced to get rid of a section
he would axe the horoscopes, after
which loud cries of protest could be
heard from the next room.

put on top of each other’s, and the
removal of rivals’posters. Campaign
posters with candidate’s faces
in toilets have been noted to be
particularly weird. “I’ll read policy
while I’m peeing, but I don’t want to
be watched.”

Night Tube ressurected
Good news for Woodward – it’ll only take 45 minutes to get home on a Friday night
O
ne of the four main
unions representing
London Underground
drivers, RMT, voted in
favour of a renegotiated contract on
Monday, paving the way toward the
Night Tube service that was due to
be implemented in September last
year.
84% of the union’s 10,000
members voted in favour of a
contract which would give drivers
a yearly pay rise linked to inflation,
the option (but not the obligation)
to work on the night service, and a
£500 bonus should the scheme go
ahead.
ASLEF, the largest drivers’ union,
are currently also voting on the
contract proposals and are expected
to follow suit when their ballot
results are announced this coming
Monday.TfL are also confident that
the service will be implemented,
having already hired around 200
new trainees who are expected to
be fully trained by the time the
scheme is rolled out, likely to be this
summer.
This is not the end of the story
however, with RMT representatives
announcing on Thursday plans
for yet more strike action over the
Night Tube. The union claims that
the deal has not been extended
to all maintenance workers and
cited issues surrounding staffing
arrangements and pensions. The
proposed Night Tube would mean
the entirety of the Jubilee,Northern,
Piccadilly and Victoria lines and
almost all of the Central line would
be operational throughout the
nights on Fridays and Saturdays.
Good news for the residents of
Woodward Hall in North Acton,
as it could cut their post-Union
commute to around 45 minutes,
from the almost 90 minutes on two
buses from South Kensington they
currently endure. 45 more minutes
in Metric, everyone’s a winner.

T
he rent strikes that UCL
students have been
undertaking since late
January are gaining more
and more traction, now boasting
a cohort of over 500 disgruntled
tenants.
The unpaid rent now exceeds
£1,000,000 and as the strike action
continues more and more people
are joining, adding to this total on a
daily basis.This is a huge surge from
last month, when the number who
had actively stood with the UCL
Cut The Rent campaign was just
150.

UCL rent strike steps up a gear
students. The movement are also
aggrieved at the response from the
UCL management, notably the
UCL Director of Estates, Andrew
Grainger, who said “We don’t set
our rents on the basis of the least
well-off students” and “some people
just simply cannot afford to live
in London” which the campaign
feel heavily disregards student’s
opinions. UCL are also thought
to be pursuing evictions for the
rebelling students.
The accommodation at UCL has
increased its rent by 56% since 2009
and is thought to run at a 45% profit
margin, corresponding to around
£15 million a year. The strikers
maintain that they are willing to
negotiate, and are demanding a
40% cut in prices with concrete,
long term commitments to low rent
levels as well as an improvement
on poor living conditions that are
present in some halls.
The last UCL strike over
accomodation was successful, with
students complaining after large
amounts of noise and disruption
from building works during exam
season. This resulted in a terms
worth of rent being refunded,giving
a sign that change may be brought
about should the cause continue to
gain momentum.

Varsity wins for IC
W
ednesday’s Varsity
Hockey matches
saw mostly college
wins over the
medics. With four games played
at Harlington, Hockey took place
two weeks earlier than Football
and Rugby, which are on the 19th
at
Heston.
The IC women’s 2s had a
monstrous 8-0 win over the medics,
and were 3-0 up just 14 minutes
into the match.
The Men’s 1s match was a close
one, with scores equal throughout
much of the game. Eventually IC
pulled through and earned a 3-2
victory, partially on p-flicks.
Medics triumphed in the Ladies’
1s game, winning 4-3 on penalties
after equalising on 4-4.
The Men’s 2s and 3s matches
both ended in 1-0 victories for the
college teams.
