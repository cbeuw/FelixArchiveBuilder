T
he London Student
Drama Festival is an
annual event with
a wonderfully self-
explanatory title. Eight universities
from London (recently down from
nine; some people just can’t take
the heat) have to develop a play
from scratch: writing, rehearsing,
rewriting and then rehearsing some
more. They then battle it out in
suitably dramatic fashion for the
prestige and rewards associated with
winning. Oh, and put on a good
show.
Our submission this year is
called N.E.E.T. (Not in Education,
Employment or Training), and tells
thetaleofprotagonistNate’sarrested
development proceeding the death
of his mother, with imaginary
characters & antisocial behaviour in
tow. It’s funny, moving, emotionally
rewarding and much, much more.
As an unbiased commentator I
thoroughly recommend checking it
out.
It’s hard to avoid drama at
Imperial; from our capital-
renowned tech crew to the dazzling
talent themselves. DramSoc’s
productions are a cornerstone of
campus culture, and the LSDF
provides the opportunity for us to
spread this culture to the rest of
London, whilst also seeing what the
more socially competent students
get up to. Goldsmiths did some
crazy shit involving flashlights last
year, so they’ll be sure to whet your
appetite for the more artisitc.
The semi-finals are at Student
Central on Sat 5th
& Sun 6th
of
March (we’re on the Sunday), and
then the top 4 plays will progress to
the finals on the 13th
at the Pleasance
Theatre.
Come on down, support Imperial
and enjoy an evening or two of the
best student theatre London has to
offer. Some of the official publicity for LSDF. Photo Credit: Student Central
