THE STUDENT NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FRIDAY 4th
MARCH 2016
Union President
G
reat strides have
been made this year
towards improving
mental health services
and support. But to fully realise
permanent change and truly
improve our student experience we
cannot lose momentum. We must
look beyond the next year.
• It’s unacceptable that luck
will continue to determine which
students are supported in times of
difficulty and which are not.
• The cost of your world
class degree can no longer be your
mental health.
• I want to pick up exactly
where previous officers have left off,
ensuring progress does not slow.
We are at a crossroads and must
maintainpressureonCollegetofulfil
their commitments to improving
our wellbeing.This is more than just
welfare; it is about education, clubs,
societies and the services that we
offer - it encompasses everything
we do.
A year as ICSMSU Treasurer,
three years as a Union bar manager
and four years in the Faculty of
Medicine has made it clear the
problems here are firmly entrenched
and change is no swift process.
I have committed to making no
promises I cannot keep. But if you
want a President who:
• has the experience to hit
the ground running as the Union
embarks on its next three-year
strategy
• prioritises long term
change for lasting benefit over
short-term and short-lived
• has a real vision for what
this university could one day be
then vote for John.
Let’s not reinvent the wheel. Let’s
do what we’re already doing, but
do it better. Let’s finish what we’ve
started.
John Golden
Raven Connelly Beng Hung
H
i everyone! I’m a
second year life science
students.
Okay. I’m not gonna
waste your precious time here
giving you sweets talk like what or
how I will make your university life
better. But, instead of just typing,
I’m gonna show by action.
As far as a true candidate is
concerned,the ability of promoting/
marketing a product has reigned
supreme. It is often said that a true
leader is a leader who has impeccable
persuasion and convincing skills.So,
this manifesto will be a platform for
me to test my promoting abilities.
Here, I will demonstrate that by
promoting Uber and Giffgaff
simcard.
“Uber is my life, I can’t live
without Uber”. This is the common
phrase we heard among university
students, especially late-night-
having-fun-students when the
tube stations are closed. For anyone
who doesn’t know what Uber is,
it is technically a “taxi” that you
can order by downloading an app
through your phone. Freshers,
“Uber” app is a must thing in your
phone after your tinder.

Secondly, in the era of
globalization in telecommunication,
everyone knows SIM card is a must
for life. But how do we choose a
good and cheap telecommunication
provider? I’ve simplified them for
you. For international students
especially, giffgaff simcard is yours.
Great location coverage services in
London, cheapest phone calls rate,
unlimited Internet and tethering.
Basically, with Giffgaff, you can’t go
wrong.

Easily, I have equipped you with
two most important surviving tools
in University.Thank you very much.
Melody Ball
I
’m Melody Ball, a Taiwanese/
English, Beit Hall senior
studying in the final year
for Biomedical science with
a strong artistic flair and passion
for change. I have worked closely
with the Union through multiple
societies and voluntary roles.
I believe I am the best voice to lead
the organisation that represents us.I
want to make your time at Imperial
College London as valuable as
possible. To achieve this I have 3
main objectives:
1. Satisfaction
2. Support
3. Ambience
To improve satisfaction:
- Promote ‘find a sponsor’ event
for projects, societies, and clubs:
ensuring informed choices and
successful funding.
– Increase ‘skills’ workshops
to enhance opportunities for
students to gain well-rounded
experience outside academics.
– Greater efficiency and
fluidity for communication
between different faculties, student
representatives via multiple
communication tools
To improve support:
– Enhance quality of
potential references such as personal
tutors by using staff that are rated
well on student feedback forms
– Greater awareness and
publicity for services and tools
available such as Imperial Plus
scheme and Student consultation
frameworks.
– Increase ease of ‘house
hunting’ by organising information
stalls with student-led advice and
recommendations
To improve ambience:
– Promote more cultural
events other than Imperial’s annual
‘Celebration of Culture’ evening.
– Strengthen student
communities by enhancing intra-
faculty ‘Mum & Dad’ schemes via
organised set timetables dedicated
to it.
– Strengthen student
communities by promoting inter-
faculty schemes such as Althea
Imperial programme and social
events such as Artfest Exhibition.
Level up with Melody for
President. See votemelody.org for

Cat Stuttard
M
y name is Cat
Stuttard, a third
year geologist here
at Imperial. I want
to inspire real, positive changes for
you, as Union President, convince
you that I can help to improve the
wellbeing and happiness of students.
I want to give you something
meaningful, tangible and achievable
and I want students to believe that
the union is working for them. An
Imperial study of more than 1000
students indicated 70% of you are
stressed on a weekly basis,and many
are suffering far worse. This is not
acceptable!
•I want the college to prioritise
students’ mental wellbeing. Too
many of us suffer stress.
•Develop training of personal tutors
to help and improve the student
experience.
•Students should feel engaged with
the union body; understand what it
can do for them. I want to engage
you with schemes like the ‘Seat with
a Sabb’campaign, the Sabbs coming
to you directly on campus!
•I want to improve co-ordination
and communication between the
Clubs, Societies and Projects, with
the Union and Sport Imperial so
less goes wrong. We can do better.
•Peer support schemes encouraged
and elder student mentor schemes
developed, so that we can all help
each other.
•Develop the Graduate Student
Union (GSU), proactively consult
postgraduates and make initial
steps to improving the postgraduate
experience and their representation.
Emails don’t cut it.
•Reconsider options for rent
decrease of first year halls.
•Direct updates on what the union
is doing for you. Students need to
see the wins.
Patryk Fryzlewicz
PRIVATISE THE UNION
Our Union has never truly been
the property of the students. It
has instead been the property
of unashamed ‘CV-Padders’,
the vagabonds prolonging their
‘university experience’at our cost, or
the power-hungry careerists.
The students’ money has been
wasted on failed events and
campaigns by this staggering
bureaucracy. The future of our
Union is a £7 million question.
My solution: PRIVATISE THE
UNION. Each Imperial Student,
for the duration of studies, will
be given a share in the Union;
and receive dividends from the
profits. The Union will become a
productive organisation, driven by
the right motives of creating value
for students and representatives
paid based on performance.
At the heart of this idea is a
simple yet effective restructuring of
governance. Several other proposals
stem from this privatisation:
1. Free Speech at University. The
non-interventionist policy will
ensure freedom of expression,
treating students as the adults that
they are.
2.Individual Responsibility.In cases
of conflict, the club’s representatives
should find appropriate solutions.
There is no such thing as group
responsibility, and it follows that
group bans are wrong.
3. No More Agitation. We will be
in the business of creating value for
students in the form of dividends,
not in the business of propaganda
‘campaigns’ on the students’ dime.
Make your vote work for you and
not for someone else’s CV. Vote for
a Union which, rather than losing
money, makes money for you.
Vote for Patryk Fryzlewicz. Vote
to PRIVATISE THE UNION.
MAKE IMPERIAL GREAT
AGAIN!
The Beit Quad cartel have
forwarded 10 candidates this year:
you can vote for the status quo,
with policies made up of corporate
speech:“streamlining,improvement,
working in synergy with”.
I, Ivan Brown, offer simple
solutions to the everyday problems
that the student actually faces at
Imperial College London such as:
Compulsory PANOPTO
recordings of all lectures
More jacket potato toppings
should be available in the library
café: beans, chili, cheese and tuna
remind us of our Imperial serfdom
Regular servicing of the vending
machines in the library and
departments
Kick out the DJ’s from 568:
Metric is for music!
Build a WALL in the library (or
at least a divider): to make a sensible
and comprehensible queueing
system for food in the library:
separating out queues for hot food
and drink, and for snacks
Make the revolving doors at
the main entrance revolve slightly
quicker for ease of access
A special flood response for
WHEN the library toilets flood
Expressing actual opinions on
student accommodation
Remove the surcharge at the
union for entrance on Fridays
Re-instate the RAG bungee jump
Keep the card office OPEN at
reasonable hours
A referendum on the name of
Metric
Regularly collect opinions on
campus of how you would like to
see your experience change, making
the small changes that make a big
difference
A review of Union spending on
sports and other activities
Re-organise the Union website
Remember, the silent majority
stands with Ivan Brown: A vote for
change
Ivan Brown Levi Ordog
“Honesty is stronger than
ideology.”
Ideas to raise student satisfaction:
President: Incompetent and
arrogant leadership is a disgrace.
SOLUTION: Negotiation,
honesty, competency, liability
towards students.
Clubs and Societies: The biggest
issue that clubs are facing is
STORAGE at Imperial Campuses.
If you ask any society, they will
mention it.
SOLUTION: Buy a container,
transform it accordingly.
Student Welfare: There is NO
welfare community at Imperial,who
students can approach for advice,
raise issues about gender equality, or
ask for help in house hunting.
SOLUTION: Allocate space for
students where they can relax and
meet people from welfare.
Union Finance: Societies, who
are contributing more, find harder
to receive funding (e.g. Techtonics),
because most of the societies’money
stays on their account, making the
Union less able to invest into quality.
SOLUTION: Encourage
wealthier societies to invest into
active societies, like the Finance
Society did.
Academic Representation:
The ESE (Earth Science and
Engineering) Department gains
100% SOLE feedback every term,
while chemical engineers suffer
from the heavy load and having less
time and effort complete SOLE.
SOLUTION: Enforce Imperial
College to put competent academic
tutors into positions, who can
deliver similar results as in ESE.
Competency: Elected as Secretary
of ACC Krav Maga Society in 2015.
Increased membership by 50%
compared to last year and convinced
around 170 people to subscribe to
the mailing list on Fresher`s Fair.
Organised socials, AGM, and
tournament with Oxford Krav
Society
Worked in Oman at an oilfield
during the summer, gained
experience in company leadership.
Eddy Kardouss
Y
our time at Imperial will
be a turning point in your
life. You will learn how to
live independently and
will be laying the foundation for
your career. You will want to have
the best experience at Imperial and
be prepared to contribute to society,
impacting the world. I can be the
one providing you with the support
to let you make your mark.
In the past 4 years, I’ve been
involved in several positions at the
Union by being President of the
Aeronautical Society, Departmental
Representative, Industrial Liaison
Officer and Year Representative 4
times in a row.I believe I have gained
knowledge and understanding of
the Union to become its President.
My main aims are to:
•Create and promote a start-up
culture.
•Strengthen student-alumni
relationships.
•Facilitate the search of
accommodation for all students.
•Empower students to contribute to
changes and decisions.
•Improve support for students and
societies.
To realise these objectives, I will:
•Introduce a start-up fair and invite
entrepreneurs for talks.
•Increase funding for student
projects.
•Create a platform in each
department allowing students to
contact relevant alumni.
•Introduce a service where graduates
can provide their flats to those of you
who are seeking accommodation.
•Encourage societies to get sponsors
to increase their budgets and
exposures.
•Organisemorejointeventsbetween
Imperial and other universities to
build new connections.
•Encourage postgraduates to join
societies and contribute to the
community.
Allow me to achieve these aims
and let’s shape the future together.
Be Ready. Vote Eddy.
Nas Andriopoulos
I
n four years as a Chemist,
the Union has played a major
part in my student experience.
As President, I would make
sure that the Union delivers value
for ALL its members, works with
College to put us students at the
centre of decision-making, and
builds a sense of community on all
campuses.
RIGHT IDEAS
•Rent guarantor scheme for
international students and home
students from low-income families
- to prevent extortionate upfront
payments.
•Strengthen the Imperial Identity
by pressing College to improve
services for recent Alumni.
•Re-structure membership to
allow YOU to remain part of the
societies you love, even when you
graduate.
•Ensure student input for all
aspects of the Imperial White City
migration – possibly the biggest
change in Imperial’s history.
•Support YOUR views and
campaigns with a technologically
enhanced democracy.
•Mentality Report: ensure that the
response is fully implemented and
continue to push for further mental-
health provisions.
•Unified booking system for Union
performance/licensed spaces.
•Extend Charing Cross café
opening times.
Full manifesto: votenas.in
RIGHT EXPERIENCE
I have two years of management-
group level experience on the
RCSU-Executive and have
represented FONS students
on Union Council (the Union’s
decision-making body). Beyond
that, I’ve got involved in a range of
clubs: from representing Imperial at
quiz tournaments to co-founding
Imperial Comedy. I am a driven
believer in student-led change
within College, which was central
to my achievements as ChemSoc
President.
With my varied experiences
and track record I can deliver the
BEST DEAL for students – PAST,
PRESENT and FUTURE.

Yulia Bulgakova
H
i, I’m Yulia, a 4th
year
Computing student.
I’ve been a year rep,
events officer, sat on
the Union Council, and chaired
DoCSoc. During this time, I
significantly increased the number
of events (to over 15), doubled the
society’s sponsorship funding (to
£12,000), and encouraged new
levels of student engagement with
the society. I absolutely loved all of
it, and I wish to use the experience
I’ve gained in order to contribute
to the overall improvement of the
Union.
What?
* Revise welfare.
* Improve the student experience.
* Work towards an efficient Union.
How?
* Create a welfare scheme similar
to academic representation.
* Re-think welfare positions and
make them more appealing to
volunteers.
* Make it easier to advertise Club
and Society events and for students
to find out about them.
* More support and recognition
from the College for students with
side projects.
* Improve collaboration between
departments and societies to
promote more cross-field projects.
* Improve collaboration with other
Unions, bridging the gap between
our students and other universities.
* Increase representation of short-
term students (masters, business
school, exchange).
* Re-design eActivities & improve
Union technology; provide part-
time work opportunities for students
with software development skills.
* Improve the communication
process between the Union and the
volunteers.
I will be making the effort to
seek out criticism and suggestions
on how to make the union a better
place for students. I believe that
being a president of the union
is not an individual job but is
about collaborating with students,
listening to their suggestions and
feedback.
David Moores I forgot to pull out. I don't want
this. I'm now quite worried.
