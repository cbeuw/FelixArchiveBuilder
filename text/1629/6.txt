The deadly orangutan cocktail
Interbreeding between Orangutan sub-species could lead to thier

espite huge changes
since the 19th
century,
there is still an uneven
playing field for women
in STEM (science, technology,
engineering, and maths).
Recently the Academy of Sciences
in South Africa found that globally,
women make up less than 12% of the
membershipoftheinfluentialbodies
of science academies.This number is
lower in the UK; women make up
only 6% of the membership at the
Royal Society; contrast this to many
countries who have less historically
established institutes and scientific
societies, like Guatemala or Ghana,
but have double the rates of female
membership at 12% and 11%
respectively.
Somehow through the course of
education and employment, women
are rapidly losing their footing in
STEM fields.
WISE - Women In Science,
Engineering and technology – is
a UK organisation looking closely
at these dynamics. In 2014, they
found an equal gender ratio of
students at the GCSE level, but
girls outperformed boys in almost
every single STEM subject. At the
A-levels, the gender ratio begins
its skewed trajectory with fewer
female students, although they still
continue to outperform boys.
In further education, numbers
of women are currently increasing
in apprenticeships, vocational
qualifications, and academia, but
gender ratios still lag behind. These
also vary greatly by field, with
ratios of women as low as 2.6%
in qualifications for construction,
planning, and built materials.
At the level of employment, the
numbers still show the same trend,
with less than 13% of workers in
STEM fields being women. So
it should be no surprise that by
the time women are in a position
to become members of the Royal
Society, the ratio is skewed at just
6%.
These numbers are telling of an
inverted pyramid with numerous
glass ceilings for women progressing
through the course of an academic
career. If we all start out equal, it’s
more than worth a ponder as to why
women are not progressing as far
and as often up the STEM career
ladder as men.

O
rangutans from a
completely distinct
subspecies have been
accidentally introduced
to another wild population, a
recent genetic study has found. The
population in question is situated
in Camp Leakey in Tanjung
Putjing National Park, within the
Indonesian portion of Borneo
(Central Kalimantan).
As their natural habitats are
continually destroyed by human
interference, increasingly orang-
utans are being displaced, with
less space available for them to
be released back into. There are
currently two species of orangutan
located in Borneo and Sumatra.
Via genetic sampling and 44 years
of Camp Leakey data, it was found
that two females reintroduced
into the park in the 1970s were
actually translocated from a
different subspecies usually found
in a separate part of the island. This
isolation means that they have been
kept genetically distinct for around
176,000 years.Sudden interbreeding
could now have serious unforeseen
consequences. To date, these
females have produced around 22
hybridized descendants.
In the past, hybridizations have
had positive or negative effects on
existing animal populations. In
some species, the cocktail of genes
can lead to an effect of ‘hybrid
vigour’, where good qualities from
each parent combine, leading
to offspring of increased fitness.
However, the opposite may
occur in the form of ‘outbreeding
Did you know...
There are two orangutan species
of which the Bornean is divided
into three subspecies
Orangutans spend more time in
the trees than any other great ape

depression’, resulting in crosses
being at a disadvantage compared to
purebreds, usually because they are
less well adapted to the surrounding
environments. And in primates
with differing behaviourial traits,
that may decrease mating success.
So what has been the consequence
for the Camp Leakey orangutan
population?
The two females in question ,
Siswoyo and Rani, were rescued
from the pet trade having originally
been captured from the North West
part of the island.Rani has interbred
prolifically with local individuals,
producing one of the largest families
in the park with 14 descendants
over three generations. Could this
be hybrid vigour in action? At the
other end of the scale, Siswoyo has
much fewer, unhealthier offspring
than any other female in the park.
After two offspring dying in infancy
and after contracting a follow-
up infection, Siswoyo died ten
days after her last birth. The only
daughter Siswoyo produced has
since had a stillborn offspring, a
daughter that died in infancy and a
son that regularly requires medical
treatment. Could this be a tragic
example of outbreeding depression?
As such, this mixture of results for a
population that is very much at risk
has got scientists worried about the
fate of Camp Leakey orang-utans.
“There is no definitive evidence of
outbreeding depression”,says Banes,
one of the main scientists in charge
of collecting the genetic samples,
“but our findings are enough
to cause serious alarm.” At the
moment, not much is known about
how stable the future is for this
population, however with constant
habitat destruction, hybridization
may be a necessity in order to allow
the species survival.Many,including
the scientists in charge of the
study, are strongly opposed to this
idea, and uphold the international
conservation guidelines. These
state genetic testing should be done
prior to reintroduction to avoid
interbreeding that could effectively
decrease population fitness, and
lead to higher rates of extinction. A
partingquotefromBanesperspective
on hybridization; “orangutans
from different populations haven’t
shared a common ancestor for
tens of thousands of years. For the
sake of short-term welfare, we’ve
compromised the viability of wild
populations – we can never take that
back”.
Threats to these wild populations
include poaching, habitat
destruction and the illegal pet trade.
But at the top of the list lies the
production of uncertified palm oil
in Southeast Asia, which is used to
manufacture a variety of food and
cosmetic products. So in the future,
try to look for as RSPO or Green
palm label that indicates the palm
oil is sustainably sourced.
