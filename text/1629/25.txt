This week the stream to
the Meet the Candidates
Live breaks, and amidst
the static you hear one of
the candidates for Deputy
President, Welfare admit
that he was the zodiac killer.
Spooky.
This week you wish the bees
in your head that chew at
your brain would stop.
This week you pick up a
flyer informing you about
someone running for Deputy
President, Welfare; however,
you don't read the fine print,
arrive at their event hoping
for some DP and receive
nothing of the sort.
This week, you're watching
Meet the Candidates, but the
level of cringe reaches toxic
levels, and you curl up and
die as Bob Marley's 'Stir it
up' plays on quietly in the
background.
This week your girlfriend tells
you if you put anymore jokes
about fucking her mum in
the horoscopes, she will leave
you. I'm-a see how long I can
get away with it and when
I’m single I’ll let you know.
This week you accidentally
paid too much for sainsburys
delivery and so, next time,
decide to only buy the
heaviest cans of beans
possible. You cause the
delivery guy to have a heart
attack.
OMG! You got the Oscar!
Congrats.
This week you are outraged
that Imperial College
London’s Alice Gast didn’t
win an Oscar for best actress
at last week's awards. I mean,
she has been acting like she
cares about Imperial students
for two years now.
Thisweekthegovernmentask
you to #CleanForTheQueen.
You do your bit by taking
some unwanted cones and
roadsigns home after a night
out, whereas the rest of your
housemates continue to leave
the kitchen like a health
hazard.
This week you are wondering
who to vote for as next year’s
FELIX Editor; however,
you realize it doesn’t matter
as you only read FELIX
for the nudes and the dank
horoscopes. I will always be
here for you.
This week you accidentally
eat Cale, the guy running
for FELIX Editor, instead of
the green, iron rich vegetable.
Other Lefy greens and
Moore are available.
