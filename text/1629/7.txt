Unmanned micro air vehicles
(MAVs) are being used for a range
of applications, from surveying
dangerous areas to delivering
packages. So far however, long
range and high manoeuvrability are
mutually exclusive. A collaboration
of Imperial with Southampton,
is developing a MAV prototype
with bat-inspired wings. The
wings use polymers situated in the
membranes, stiffening and relaxing
in response to the electrical current
running through them. According
to Dr Rafael Palacios, from the
department of Aeronautics at
Imperial, ‘‘The MAVs will be able
to travel longer distances in tighter
spaces with high controllability,
just like a bat’’ making them and
their production more economical.
The aim is to get the bat-inspired
technology to fly a distance of 30
or 40 miles. However this requires
a lot more work as they will need a
battery or chemical device. In the
future these MAVs could rival the
10 mile range of Amazon drones.
A
t Sh!t Sc!ence, we argue
that all research, no
matter how outrageously
ridiculous-sounding, has
a purpose and contributes to widen
our knowledge of the world. Even
when it is a study of how fish can be
left-handed.
Well… not left-handed, per se.
It turns out that a specific type of
fish called the scale-eating cichlid
has a mouth that is angled a couple
degrees. For half these cichlids , the
mouth tilts to their left and the for
the other half, it tilts to their right.
This particular species could be
considered rather foul, leaching off
larger fish and ripping off scales
from their sides as they obliviously
swim. And since this phenomenon
was first described in 1993, it was
thought that the way their mouth
is slanted determines which side of
the fish the cichlid will prey on. So
we were pretty sure that we knew
why, but we weren’t really sure that
we were sure.

Scientists left hanging over left handed fish conundrum
That is, not until researchers
from Toyama University’s
Graduate School of Medicine and
Pharmaceutical Sciences captured
200 of these fish and ripped them
open (they deserve it, let’s be
honest). Surprisingly, by analysing
the stomach contents of young and
adult scale-eating cichlids, it turned
out that even though the young fish
have slanted mouths, they eat scales
from both sides of their prey, and it
is only later that they start to attack
the fish from the side their mouths
lean, when they become more
efficient at preying.This tells us that
the fish learn how to take advantage
of their physiognomy. And this
finding makes this curious piece of
research important to the field of
laterality.
Let me explain. As humans, we
love symmetry, and a symmetrical
face is a mark of attractiveness.
However, our bodies are profoundly
asymmetrical. Researchers are very
interested in laterality, i.e. why
humans and other animals use
one side of their body more
than the other.
Most humans are right-
handed, and it turns out we
are mostly right-sided as well,
we will prefer to use our right
foot, our right eye, our right
ear… Why is this laterality
so strongly ingrained in our
biology? It is thought that in
our species, Homo sapiens, our
strong laterality is a result of the
literal laterality of our brains,
our centre for language residing
in our left hemisphere, perhaps
encouraging us to use our right
hand. But we still don’t know
whether laterality is genetic or
acquired. Studies such as this
one, showing an example of
behavioural laterality, where
the phenomenon is acquired
through learning, give us
better insights into our own
development.
