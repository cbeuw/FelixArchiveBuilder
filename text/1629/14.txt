H
i, I’m Claudia, a final
year Computing
student.
I will:
- Keep fighting against the mental
health stigma.
- Speed up the process for
obtaining financial help.
- Make sure no one is left behind.
- Demand more funding for IQ,
Cultural Societies.
- Maximise open hours to ensure
all students are heard.
We need to continuously
encourage open discussions on
mental health, to ensure that
everyone is accustomed to their
normality and frequency. I will
continue the development of
systems such as IC Mentality and
the Student Space, and significantly
increase their visibility. You deserve
to know help exists, and you deserve
access to it at all times.
The process for obtaining
financial help is incredibly slow.
Bottlenecks need to be identified
and solved in order to provide the
necessary help at the right time.
Moreover, prospective students are
intimidated by the idea of living
in such an expensive area, and this
is undoubtedly a waste for our
community.
Regardless of how hard you work,
life might sometimes happen.
Perhaps as a mental health issue,
minor surgery, or something else
entirely. I plan to set up a group
of volunteers per department,
who would provide academic help
to students in need. A one-time
thing doesn’t have to evolve into a
downward spiral.
Within AstroSoc, I fought for a
developing society and a supportive
environment. As an academic rep,
I ensured all voices were heard. I
wish to contribute to improving
the overall experience at Imperial,
and this starts with proactively
committing to student support.
Akash Jyoti
4th
year International Physicist,
RCSU Welfare Officer 2 years,
amateur footballer and comedian.
I love being a part of Imperial. Yet
student satisfaction is appalling.
Expectations at Imperial are
exceptionally high, irrespective of
your course and year, often without
proper support. While this helps
us become tomorrow’s leaders, it’s
not pleasant today. That’s why I’m
taking a STAND!
GAME PLANS
• CENTRALISE all personal
and professional contacts here to
support you
• Be available in JCR/SCR EVERY
WEEK
• Host a welfare open forum
EVERY TERM
• BATTLE mental health stigma by
advocating its NEED for increased
awareness
• Support student-led campaigns
like Mentality and ICSexism
so your voices are HEARD and
concerns ACTED UPON
• Lobby for a MORE EFFECTIVE
and RELEVANT College support
system, including a 48 hour reply
deadline for personal tutors
•ExtendtheUnion’ssupportnetwork
to include POSTGRADUATES
• Put a SMILE on your face
WHY ME?
• I am one of you and I wish
someone had helped me
• RCSU Welfare Officer since
2014, dealing with student issues
in Union Council, and leading last
year’s AND this year’s Welfare
Week, SO LOOK OUT!
• As an international student,I know
what it’s like to live very, very far
away home, conversing in a second
language and being immersed in a
new culture
• DEFEATED a physical injury in
2013, and extreme stress in 2014, to
personally know the improvements
needed in physical and mental
health support, especially during
exams

Emma-Louise Little
I
am running for DP Welfare
because I am passionate about
improving student life. No
issue is too Little or too big!
As LGBT+ Officer this year I
successfully introduced a family
scheme, increasing diversity and
providing support for our members
for years to come. I also introduced
a Trans Healthcare Seminar- the
first of its kind at Imperial, opening
the door to more, specific welfare
training in future.
I sit on the Community and
Welfare Board, Union Council and
am involved with a range of societies,
both IC and ICSM, providing me
insight into issues college-wide and
within specific faculties, sub-groups
and minorities.
What I will do:
Mental Health
Introduce student-led and
personalised support - from
workshopsdirectedatspecificgroups
(i.e. international, club captains),
to expansion of counselling and
support services on ALL campuses,
and even a nightline app.
Gender Equality and Consent
Use education to tackle
discrimination and harassment
by introducing sexual consent
questionnaires but also devise a
clear zero tolerance policy – so staff
and students are equipped to handle
any issues.
Housing
Ensure the college provides
affordable student housing for all
and continue to work on a system
whereby International Students are
able to privately rent fairly, without
excess fees.
Higher Education Green Paper
Campaign against potential rising
of tuition fees, the scrapping of the
maintenance grant and a new system
that will see teaching standards fall,
not rise and
Push for a consistent welfare
framework across college faculties.

H
iya!
Six months in,
as much as I have
achieved quite a lot
as the current Officer, there's still
more to do. I've discovered new
issues within welfare, particularly
in the field of mental health, stress
management and the protection
of sexual assault victims. Over the
last months I've opened up the
CGCU as somewhere you could go
for concerns or questions, and have
shown that I can be trusted and
relied upon.
Having had time to get into the
nuts and bolts of the role and Union
system, I would like to keep the
momentum of my work going. New
initiatives include:
1) Formalising the role of Welfare
Reps or a Welfare sub-Committee
2) Further increase signposting &
awareness of mental health services
and investigating how effective
students actually find them
3) Combating the issue of consent
and lack of rape victim support on
campus.
Further developments include:
1) I'd like to implement the newly
approved puppy therapy scheme
properly and perhaps introduce
other temp events
2) Improving the pilot scheme
of confidential sexual health
deliveries - which has received
positive reviews so far.This includes
improving efficiency by increasing
stock supplies.
3) Raising issues with College
over their sketchy sex offenders
policy.
Come August, I would have had
a year's worth of experience and
would have the same passion and
drive as I did when I first started,
if not more. Email me for queries

http://DebForDPW.com
Choose a subwarden
with extensive welfare
experience for Deputy President
(Welfare) in 2016/17!
University can be the most
fun, educational, but potentially
daunting time of your life. In fact,
last year alone, three out of four
students reported problems with
mental health at Imperial. It's
therefore vital that we constantly
strive to improve the welfare system
at ICU and in the college.
I started my PhD at Imperial in
2012, and over the last four years
have been a society President, a
graduate teaching assistant, and
subwarden at Beit Hall. This means
I have direct experience helping and
understanding students’ problems,
and working with the Imperial
welfare system.
My priorities:
Better Housing, on and off
campus
Support International/EU
students
Promote Women's Rights
Improve Mental Health Support
Increase BME and LGBT
Representation
Increase Disability Support
Greater support in departments
More postgraduate support
I will:
Secure more access to GPs and
mental health professionals, and
provide easy-to-access area based
information on local GPs and
services
Launch peer-led support groups,
for both academic and personal
problems
Provide EU students with greater
support, in case of Brexit, for
funding and visas
Increased representation of EU/
International, LGBTI, and BME
students in union and college roles
Cheaper/Closer hall
accommodation on campus
Secure more legal support for help
living out
Promote gender right campaigns
on campus
Work with departments to provide
full-time welfare support staff, for
UGs and PGs

W
eallknowImperial’s
welfare system has
both positives and
negatives. Through
my own personal challenges with
depression I’ve had the opportunity
to experience both sides and the
impact of the efforts of previous
DPWs. My insights have given
me the drive and resilience needed
to make further improvements to
create a more positive and fulfilling
Imperial experience. I believe that
the breadth of issues that we all
face can be addressed through the
following initiatives:
Timetabling affects every student
– I propose:
- Departmental consultations
with year reps, mental health
representatives, the DPE and
DPW when planning the spread of
deadlines and exams.
- Stress-less days aligned with
departmental peak periods.
Reducing stress-levels improves
mental health but better support
across the College is imperative.We
need:
- An anonymous counselling
app for immediate help from
counsellors, the DPW and Union
representatives
- Obligatory mental health
training given equal footing as first
aid across staff, starting with senior
and personal tutors.
- Support sessions for all students
who are directly or indirectly
affected by mental health issues.
- Hold Personal Tutors
accountable through SOLE-
inspired reviews.
Consent:
- Raising awareness around
consent.
- Improving sexual assault support
and communication.
Student housing:
- Building on work by the previous
DPW to open the option of using
Imperial as a guarantor on rental
contracts
- Lobby the University for
affordable accommodation closer to
College, reversing current trends.
Funding:
- Create better awareness of all the
funding resources and issues among
students, especially for medics.
