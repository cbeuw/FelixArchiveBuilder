The top three
car chases
that aren’t in
Fast &
Furious
T
hey’re great guilty
pleasures, the Fast and
Furious films, aren’t they?
How can anyone not
enjoy having some drinks and a
pizza while watching several ripped
guys illegally street race and pull
off stupid heists? Fast and Furious
is simply a very fun, enjoyable set
of action films, and – of course –
they feature some great car chases.
However, my opinion that Tokyo
Drift is the best one is apparently
some sort of cardinal sin… let’s see
if my friends can agree with me on
this list at least:
Blues Brothers (1980)
There’s actually several big car
chases in this 80s classic. The two
that really stand out to me are when
the brothers completely destroy
Dixie Square Mall and, of course,
the ending.No film since has packed
so much comedy and carnage into
such short periods of time. Fun fact
– a record (at the time) 103 cars we
destroyed in the making of this film.
The Raid 2 (2014)
Hey guys, have you heard that I
like The Raid films?!? I think I may
have mentioned the series a few
hundred times in this column alone.
In all seriousness though, any list
of the best car chases that doesn’t
include the incredible highway fight
scene in The Raid 2 is just objectively
inaccurate. I would also recommend
watching the horrifically convoluted
making-of for this incredible scene.
Lupin III: The Castle of
Cagliostro (1979)
Hey guys, did you hear that I like
Miyazakai films too?!? Oh, right,
sorry. At least here I have some big-
name back up for my love: Steven
Spielberg has famously described
the opening car chase of animated
classic The Castle of Cagliostro “one
of the greatest chase sequence ever
filmed”. The jazzy soundtrack here
is also a perfect remix of the classic
theme to the 70s TV show Lupin
III.

Dispatches from the Oscars
Documentary corner: Dear Zachary
Ben Collier
Writer

efore I begin this review,
I’m going to really
strongly recommend that
if you haven’t already seen
the film you should avoid reviews
or summaries online. Should you
watch this documentary – as I
did – with no foreknowledge then
I guarantee that watching Dear
Zachary: A Letter to a Son about his
Father will be a genuinely unique
experience. Director Kurt Kuenne
has a very important message to get
across here, and the structure of the
film – the way it progresses, slowly
giving you drips of information – is
essential to its effectiveness.
To give a very simple synopsis
of the film, it was made (as per its
namesake) as a memorial to the life
of Andrew Bagby, a good childhood
friend of the director. He was
murdered by his girlfriend, Shirley
Jane, after ending their tumultuous
relationship of several months.
The recipient of this letter is the
couple’s son, Zachary, born shortly
after Shirley’s arrest.The film is split
between documenting the murder
case and speaking directly to
Zachary, telling him about the kind
of man his father was. The level of
love and care that went into this film
is apparent, as is the love Kuenne,
and the dozens of friends and
family members interviewed had for
Andrew. This cinematic scrapbook
showcases Andrew’s personality,
his likes and dislikes, and the effect
that he had on so many people’s
lives. Much like the ending of It’s a
Wonderful Life, certain parts of this
film are life-affirming, highlighting
all the positive effects a single man
can have on so many people.
Dear Zachary is really an
experience above all else. I honestly
cannot remember the last time I was
so viscerally affected by a film. And
for this reason, despite it being one
of my new favourite documentaries,
I doubt I’ll ever watch it again. A
full range of emotions are elicited
through the viewing experience,
and anyone who gives it a watch
can expect to be angered, amused,
depressed, sickened, and everything
else in-between. No other film
has conveyed the impact of losing
someone in such an emotionally
intelligent and accurate way.
However, despite all the dark
moments, the lasting feeling most
people will experience is one of
hope and inspiration – at seeing the
dignity and love shown by Andrew’s
parents throughout.
The film masterfully avoids
the pitfall of slipping into overly
sentimental territory. There’s
sentimentality, for sure, but
nothing is forced. The charmingly
amateurish way everything is
shot and edited, along with the
backstory of why the director is
completing this project, just adds to
the appeal. Overall, Dear Zachary is
a very human documentary and one
I cannot recommend enough; its
contents are incredibly important,
and I would consider it a disservice
to yourself not to give it a watch.

T
he Academy Awards
took place last Sunday
evening, and your
intrepid FELIX team
stayed up until the early hours of
Monday morning keeping track
of the ceremony on an illegal live-
stream, significant portions of
which were dubbed into Turkish.
Truly, there is nothing we will not
do for journalism. As usual, there
were victories, surprises, snubs, and
questionable jokes, and that was
only in the office…
The biggest story of the night was
the success of Mad Max: Fury Road,
who swept up awards for six of its ten
nominations. The awards may have
all been for technical achievement –
Sound Editing/Mixing, Costumes,
Make-up & Hairstyling, Editing,
and Production Design – and
George Miller may have missed
out on the Best Director prize.
Nevertheless, the evening showed
that big-budget action spectacles
can have more of an impact then
perhaps previously thought.
And, of course, after Mad Max
claimed all those prizes, there was
little left for The Revenant, who
managed to win three Oscars,
despite being nominated for 12.
Sure, Leo won his Best Actor award
(is it right to put ‘finally’? This may
have been his fifth nomination, but
I think you’d be hard pressed to
name a year where he was actually
‘robbed’ of the award), Alejandro
Iñarritu collected his Best Director
trophy the second year running, and
Emmanuel Lubezki was awarded
Best Cinematography for the third
year in a row. But The Revenant
entered the ceremony as the
frontrunner, and failed to clear up.
Most notably, The Revenant failed
to win Best Picture, an award
which went, in possibly one of the
biggest surprises of the night, to
investigative drama Spotlight – also
winner of Best Original Screenplay.
Writing in The Guardian, Alicia
Shepard said the win for Spotlight,
which focuses on the Boston Globe’s
uncovering of the Catholic sex
scandal, “can expose to a whole new
generation why journalism matters”.
That’s us here at FELIX. We’re
journalism.
In a charged speech, producer
Michael Sugar said that the
message of the film should “resonate
all the way to the Vatican”, issuing a
direct challenge to Pope Francis to
“protect the children and restore the
faith”.
Spotlight’s win for Best Picture
wasn’t the only surprise of the night.
Mark Rylance won Best Supporting
Actor, which was widely expected
to go to Sylvester Stallone, for his
role as Rudolf Abel in Bridge of
Spies – the film’s only award. Best
Visual Effects went to Ex Machina,
the British sci-fi drama whose
budget was minuscule compared to
its competitors; Ex Machina beat
out stiff competition for the award,
including Star Wars, Mad Max, and
The Revenant,whose CGI bear scene
garnered acclaim. Alicia Vikander,
the star of Ex Machina, also took
home Best Supporting Actress for
her role in The Danish Girl.
Ennio Morricone took home the
Best Score award for his treatment
of Quentin Tarantino’s The Hateful
Eight. Going up to receive the
award, the 87-year-old Morricone
was treated to a standing ovation, a
recognition of his decades of work
in the industry. Inside Out took
home the award for Best Animated
Feature, as expected, and British
documentary Amy,following the life
of the late singer Amy Winehouse,
took home Best Documentary.
Sugar’s speech on the Catholic
Church wasn’t the only pointed
statement of the night; in fact,
nearly all winners had something
to say about the state of the world.
DiCaprio used his time to address
climate change, calling it “the most
urgent threat facing our species”;
Best Adapted Screenplay winner
Adam McKay, who won for The
Big Short, told the audience “if
you don’t want big money to
control government, don’t vote for
candidates who take money from
big banks” (a thinly-veiled attack
on Hillary Clinton, who made $3
million from 12 speeches to big
banks in 2013-15); and even Best
Costume winner, Jenny Bevan, said
that we might be heading towards a
Mad Max world if “we’re not kinder
to each other”. Such an innocuous
message didn’t stop a whole row
of celebrities from giving her the
stink-eye as she strolled down the
aisle to collect the award, decked
out in a bejewelled leather jacket
and scarf, giving the sartorial finger
to any notions of what women
‘should’ wear at awards.
But all this was overshadowed
by host Chris Rock, who used his
platform as host to point out the
racial inequality of Hollywood. If
you’ve ever wondered what a room
full of white people unsure whether
to clap or not sounds like, just give
his opening monologue a watch.
There were some aspects of his
hosting that did work well, such as
the segment where he interviewed
black cinema-goers in Compton,
none of whom had heard of Bridge
of Spies. It pointed out the glaring
disconnect between what the public
actually watch, and what gets
nominated, as well as highlighting
the disappointment at the lack of
nods for Straight Outta Compton.
Elsewhere, his jokes left a sour taste
in the mouth, like when he quipped
that in the past African-Americans
were too busy getting “raped and
lynched” to protest about diversity,
or when he said Jada Pinkett-Smith
boycotting the ceremony was like
“me boycotting Rihanna’s panties – I
wasn’t invited”.And then there were
some that left us totally stumped,
like his introduction of Stacey
Dash as director of the ‘minority
outreach programme’, who came on
and wished the bemused audience a
happy black history month.
Singer and ‘musician’ Sam Smith
also tried to get in on the social-
justice act when collecting his award
for Best Original Song for ‘Writing
on the Wall’, dedicating his
award to the LGBT+ community.
Unfortunately, he also tried to claim
that he was the first openly gay
man to win an Oscar (there have
actually been, at my count, at least
ten Oscars going to gay men).To be
fair, he prefaced this with the claim
that the fact no other gay man had
won an Oscar “[might not] be the
case”, showing us all that ignorance
should never get in the way of
saying what you want to say. When
corrected of his mistake, he simply
presumed he was the second gay
man to win an Oscar.Someone then
pointed out Howard Ashman had
won two Oscars for Best Original
Song, to which Smith quipped “I
should know him. We should date”.
Ashman died in 1991 from AIDS-
related complications. Smith has
since quit Twitter, and will – no
doubt – claim that he is the first gay
man to do so.
