f you’ve seen me walking about
this week, queuing in the
library or wandering around
Sherfield trying to scam sweets
or condoms off of candidates, you
may well have heard me cursing the
sheer bloody volume of you who’ve
applied to take up sabb roles next
year. This meant that we really had
to squash your ramblings into this
year’s election pullout which can be
found on page 14.
Really, it’s very cool how many of
you want to take a year out to run
the union, and the number of you
who are totally left field is great
too. Instead of the usual dep rep
to constituent union path, we have
some off kilter candidates who
have never been to council, don’t
have a working knowledge of the
constitution and who I, personally,
don’t know from fucking adam and

that’s not necessarily a bad thing.
What do I know, or indeed who?
None of you, that’s for sure.
Anyway, it’s great that you all
want to take part. Last year, only
two people ran for President, with
arguably one being a joke candidate
and FELIX was uncontested (I’m
not ashamed). Now, there's not even
a frontrunner. Even if there was, I'm
not allowed to say it here.
It really does matter who wins,
despite years of me assuring myself
it doesn’t and so justifying my voting
decisions which were mainly based
on people’s pictures.
As a current sabb,it’s a weird time.
On one hand, everybody’s talking
out of their bumholes on things
they don’t understand, but on the
other,they think your job is cool and
they want to do it. Are there loads
of applicants this year because we’ve

In response to ' Imperial
President Alice Gast signs pro-EU
letter', Issue 1628
Madam,
I for one hope that Professor
Gast signed her pro-EU letter in
her capacity as President of the
University.
Leaving the EU would most
certainly have an impact on
Imperial's ability to recruit talented
EU students and academics,and
may well have an impact on
the ability of our researchers to
shape international science policy.
Therefore, it most certainly falls
under Professor Gast's remit
to maintain Imperial's strong
international standing, and it is
entirely appropriate for her to
join over a hundred other vice-
chancellors in signing the letter in
an official capacity.

Please, it's 'Madam Editor'.The
tory last week got it right. Please,
you're making me wanna vote
'leave'.

In response to 'Imperial
President Alice Gast signs pro-EU
letter', Issue 1628
Dear Madam Editor,
To comment on the EU-stance
with respect to Ms. Gast’s recent
interaction with the pro-EU letter
I feel that if this action is to be
taken as her speaking on behalf
on Imperial college I would be
disappointed. That is not to say
I disagree with her personally
believing in the pro-EU stance
and certainly, I have no particularly
strong views on this issue myself.
Where I do take offence is in the
fact that our university has 17,000
students and to suppose that any
one person could speak for all of
them without any kind of research
is presumptuous at best and surely
condescending.
Talking to students around
campus it is clear to see there are
plenty that sit on either side of
this debate. Much like the Hokey
Cokey there’s In, Out, and Shake it
All About camps present. Surely if
the university was to have an official

been so bad, everyone thinks they
can do better? If you know, please
don’t tell me. It doesn’t matter.

stance it should be guided by the
student voice which, shocker, there’s
a whole body of elected student
representatives ready formed for
this kind of discussion. Ali, bbz,
leave it to Union Council. Peace &
love & light,

Well, there you go, the hacks
have spoken.
