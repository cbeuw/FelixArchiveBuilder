ELIX has discovered that
the Chinese university
that will partner with
Imperial at a new tech
hub on the White City campus has
been cited by a US security firm as
being a recruitment hotspot for the
unit of the Chinese army alleged
to be involved in the country’s
cyberwarfare program.
Zhejiang University signed a
deal with Imperial late last year,
following plans for an Imperial-
Chinese “entrepreneurship hub”
at Imperial West in Acton, which
will bring together academics from
the Business School and Zhejiang’s
School of Management.
At the time, President Gast
described the deal as a push to make
Imperial College “China’s best
partner in the west”.
Analysts at the cybersecurity
firm, Mandiant, note that: “Unit
61398 aggressively recruits”
talent from computer science
departments of Chinese universities
“such as Zhejiang University
School of Computer Science and
Technology”.
Unit 61398 is a highly secretive
division of the Chinese People’s
Liberation Army. It is thought to
be tasked with economic espionage
against the United States, the UK,
and according to the Mandiant
report “any organisation where
English is the primary language”.So
it’s a step up from GCHQ recruiters
at a careers fair.

agency Xinhua announced the

CTV of a violent
mugging that took
place last month near
Gloucester Road has
been released by the Metropolitan
Police, in the hopes that the
perpetrators will be found.
The attack, which took place
on Cornwall Gardens, under ten
minutes walk away from campus,
involved a pair of muggers attacking
a man from behind and wrestling
his belongings from him in the
process.

arrest of the university’s then
Vice-President for “economic
crimes” (which is understood to
be shorthand for corruption). In
March of the same year, Reuters
reported a senior professor jailed for
embezzling more than 10 million
yuan (£1.08 million) of research
contracts.
The college is currently run by
Party Chief Jin Deshui. Vice-
governor of Zhejiang Province
from 2004-2011, Mr. Deshui is
known to be a personal associate of
President Xi Jinping. A 2010 report
by the Zhejiang Daily claims that 15
people had died there due to police
torture in that year alone.
The new centre is expected to
open some time next year.
It occured at 9:30pm on Saturday
the 30th
of January.
The first attacker grabbed the man
from behind in a chokehold, before
his accomplice stole the man’s
phone and wallet from his pocket in
the ensuing struggle.
The assailants then dragged the
man to the ground before fleeing
into the night.Police said the victim
was “very shaken” but unharmed by
the experience. The men, described
as white and aged 25 to 35 were
wearing dark clothes, one of which
having dark hair and one sporting a
black cap.
The road is used often by students
who are commuting towards
Earls Court, and some College
departments have sent reminders
to their students warning them to
be extra vigilant on their travels too
and from college, especially late at
night.
Anyone with any information is
urged to contact Kensington and
Chelsea CID on 020 8246 0189.
