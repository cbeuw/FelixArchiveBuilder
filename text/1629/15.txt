Luke McCrone
H
i there, I’m Luke.
I am currently a
postgraduate student in
ESE with three years’
experience as a Year Representative
in undergraduate Geology, which
gave me the opportunity to receive
feedback directly from students
and to transform their ideas into
tangible changes, such as increasing
the use of Panopto and Mentimeter
in the department.
My experiences as a Hall Senior,
two years as an undergraduate
at Tizard Hall, and currently as
a postgraduate-level Subwarden
have given me extensive insight
into education at Imperial,
through interactions with fresher,
international Erasmus and PhD
students.
I will aspire to achieve the
following aims if elected Deputy
President (Education):
Feedback: Improve speed and
quality of feedback across college by
instigating a college-wide ‘Feedback
Traffic Light’ system (already being
piloted) to monitor feedback speed
based on a two week return period.
Assessment:Utilise‘questionnaires’
designed to obtain information on
specific coursework assignments
(e.g. how much time the student
spent) which can be incorporated
into departmental curriculum
reviews to help regulate assessment
quantity and quality.
eLearning: Develop college-
wide strategies for ‘Technology
Enhanced Learning’, which will
address methods for utilising
Mentimeter, Panopto, Blackboard
etc. at the departmental level.
Continue to explore new concepts,
including ‘Blended Learning’ and
online discussion boards.
Postgraduates: Ensure all taught
postgraduate courses adhere to
college policy, including Wednesday
afternoons free and the availability
of personal tutors, who could also
be project supervisors. Review
the Graduate Student Union and
reassess academic support in place
for PhD students (e.g. dealing with
supervisor issues confidentially).

I!! I'm ALEX
MYTENKA and I'm a
postgraduate studying
MSc Environmental
Technology, after recently
graduating from the RSM/ESE
with a BSc in Earth Science.
During my time here I have
been truly fortunate to experience
everything that makes Imperial
College the greatest place for
students to learn, succeed and gain
the vital skills necessary to fulfil
their dreams. My transition from
undergraduate to postgraduate
has also shown me that there is
still much we can do to make our
student experience even better.
This is my mission:
TOENSUREALLSTUDENTS,
BOTH UNDERGRADUATE
AND POSTGRADUATE,HAVE
THE GREATEST AMOUNT
OF OPPORTUNITIES,
RESOURCES AND SUPPORT
POSSIBLE.
As Deputy President of Education
I aim to tackle 3 main goals:
1. Lay the foundations for a
SIMPLER,MOREPRACTICAL,
IN-HOUSE CREATED
ONLINE LEARNING SYSTEM
FOR THE ENTIRE COLLEGE.
2. INCREASE STUDENT
FEEDBACK OPPORTUNITIES,
and AID DEPARTMENTS

3. ADVOCATE GREATER

As an ESE academic rep (year 3)
I saw that THESE GOALS ARE
ACHIEVABLE!
Through my experiences as a
former assistant station manager of
ICTV, General Secretary of Media
Group, Master of Ceremonies, sales
consultant and uncle I also have the
leadership and team-working skills,
passion and relentless work ethic
necessary to drive change.
SO TOGETHER: LET'S
MOVE FORWARD!!

Deputy President (Clubs & Societies)
Ju Yoo
From my experience of starting up
a new society, starting and running
the Volunteer Dinner and being
chair of Connect, I have a deep
understanding and the experience
to the problems in running our clubs
and societies. I’d like to use these
skills to make a kick-ass sabbatical
officer, and get to know each and
every one of the 340+ clubs and
societies. As a year rep for 2 years,
I’ve sat on numerous meetings to
push for what the student body
wants.I’ve held committee positions
in philosophy society, AMSA and
others and been a finalist in the
Venture Catalyst Challenge.
I’m beyond passionate about
helping you get the most out of our
societies. To many of us, societies
are what makes uni fun. They
give us a chance to explore new
experiences, make new friends and
give us something to look forward to
amongst all the exams, projects and
deadlines. As your officer it’d be a
privilege to help you enjoy your time
as much as I have mine, and work
hard to #makegoodthingshappen.
As DPCS, I’d like to provide the
following;
- Weekly afternoon drop-in sessions
at Charing Cross Campus for
students that live in this area.
- Create a monthly open forum for
clubs and societies to raise issues
any issues.
- Help volunteering societies
expand and collaborate with other
universities.
- Make it easier for societies to
support each other and co-host
events for a stronger, cohesive
student body.
- Start sponsorship training for
societies.

I
want to improve the
communication between
Sport Imperial and the union,
and to increase funding for
clubs and societies.
The allocation to C&S through
budgeting has increased by ~10%
from £307,000 in 2011 to £332,000
in 2015, whereas participation
increased by ~40% from 18,000 in
to 25,000 total memberships in this
time; this is clearly not proportional.
I would like to be able to allocate
increased funding to clubs and
societies with the aim to increase
participation all across Imperial.
This is important as they provide an
Jonathan Zheng
H
i, I'm Jonny.
As the founder of the
new Magic Society at
Imperial, I know what
it's like to start up a society, and I
want to make the process better.
I'll do this by keeping new clubs in
the loop through meeting each one
face to face, and giving them more
updates on the progress of their
applications.
I've also played hockey over my
4 years here, and sport at Imperial
has seen its fair share of 'bad
behaviour' in public, losing clubs a
lot of time and money. I'm going to
make the process for resolving these
problems clearer, by having an open
door policy to provide advice and
guidance through the issues that
inevitably arise.
Finally, I'm going to make sure
that the people in charge of clubs
know that they can count on me
to keep them up to date with the
information they need. The big
problem I've seen in my experience
with the union has been the lack of
a reliable source of help, for those
who come across problems when
running their clubs. I aim to be that
source, in order to keep the stress
and frustration when working with
the union to a minimum.
excellent way to make friends and
a much-desired break from work,
contributing to overall wellbeing
and personal development.
There is room for improvement
in the communication between
Sport Imperial and the union. A
joint strategy is currently being
developed, the successful execution
of which would be a vital task for
the incoming DPCS. Our sports
clubs are student-run, therefore it
is important to me to ensure that
students are heavily consulted in
this process.
Having been the Vice President of
Clubs & Societies for the RSMU, I
have a good understanding of how
to oversee clubs and to help them
where necessary; I understand
that most clubs are very happy to
run themselves. I organised The
Bottle Match, the second oldest
rugby varsity in the world played
between the Royal School of Mines
and Camborne School of Mines;
through this I learnt how to create a
compromise to appease staff higher-
up whilst maintaining the interests
of the students.
David Moores
FELIX Editor
I
'm Lef. Some of you may
know me from back in my
undergrad days as a young,
starry eyed biologist. I'm back
in college now,slightly disillusioned,
a science communication MSc
student editing the science section
for FELIX on the side.
Deciding to run for FELIX editor
was not easy.From what I've seen,
it's a hard and thankless job.Yet it is
crucial that it's done well and based
on my past experience as LeoSoc
president, I'm confident I'm cut out
for the task.
At Imperial, the diversity
characterizing our
community,whether that's
disciplinary, or political, or sexual
or what may you, is often forgotten,
buried under the silence that results
from our lack of communication.
Which is why as FELIX Editor,
I would do my best to encourage
more students to use FELIX as
a platform for expressing their
thoughts and opinions. Through
outreach initiatives and workshops
I aim at embracing new ideas
and believe I can increase student
involvement,while fostering a much
needed dialogue.
I would also continue the
development of the paper's
online platform and social media
presence and try to use it to
generate additional income through
advertising.This should increase the
volume and independence of the
student voice and protect it against
any attacks.
I want FELIX to be the paper
we deserve. A paper that offers
development opportunities to
students and one that challenges its
readers. A paper truly representative
of the student community.

ELIX needs an
independent, experienced,
and forward-thinking
editor; someone to keep it
free from Union interference, make
it relevant to students, and lead it
into the future – that person is me.
I’ve worked tirelessly as both
Music and Games Editor to deliver
quality, innovative content, writing
over 50 articles this year alone. As
editor of Imperial’s forthcoming
gaming magazine, Another Castle,
I’ve had the opportunity to design
and organise a publication from
scratch.
While FELIX has a large physical
presence on campus, its digital
M
y name is David.
I would (clearly)
like to be the editor of
FELIX.
I need your help.
If enough of you vote for me, I can
become editor of FELIX.
This means we will be able to do
many good things.
These good things include:
Investigative student journalism
Non-investigative student
journalism
Bigger, better, unbelievably good
hangman section
Drunk acquaintance of the week
More puzzles
Crosswords you can actually solve

Paul Balaji weekly column
We need more Imperial specific
coverage. We need more interaction
between the average Imperial student
and FELIX. We need FELIX to be
edgy, without being a stereotypical
student newspaper. We need articles
people actually want to read, not
further reporting on news available in
the BBC website 5 days earlier.
A student newspaper needs to be
controversial, but without trying too
hard.IcanturnFELIXintosomething

free newspaper sometime next year.
