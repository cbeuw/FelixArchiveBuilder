L
ast weekend, the Imperial
College Kendo Club
organized a major event in
the world of kendo in the
UK: the University Championship,
or ‘Taikai’. It was a frank success,
with students gathering from as far
as Scotland and Wales to the Ethos
gym here in South Kensington for
the traditional annual competition
between university dojos. A total
of 150+ kendoka – making it the
largest UK Taikai since its inception
20 years ago – sparred over the
two days in different categories,
individual and team competitions,
split between beginners and veterans
(and genders for individuals).
The contest was fierce, and the
Imperial students fought very
well, with captain of the club,
John Jonsson, taking second place

Imperial Kendoka organise UK tournament and win silver
in the beginners (kyu) individual
competition and one of the
Imperial teams (consisting of John
Jonsson, Byung Sup Song, Spencer
Cheung, Francis Poole and Wilko
Duprez) also winning a silver medal
– in the beginners category. The
Taikai was also an opportunity for
kendo students to pass exams by
demonstrating their skills under the
eye of the BKA, the British Kendo
Association, to progress further up
in grades. Congratulations to all the
Imperial students who successfully
received their Ikkyu and Sho-dan!
Feedback from participants revealed
a high level of satisfaction about
the tournament’s organization
and proceedings – for which the
Imperial Kendo Club can also be
proud. Next year’s Taikai will take
place in Cambridge, hosted by the
University of Cambridge Kendo’s
Society – and Imperial students are
determined to bring back gold this
time.
The week before the Taikai,
the Imperial Kendo Club also
received fellow kendo students from
Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo,
Japan, building the friendship
between the two university clubs
through practice and friendly
competition as well as attending
the Union bar.The Imperial College
Kendo Club has existed since 1998
under the coaching of Emiko
Yoshikawa Sensei 6th
Dan, who has
represented the UK at the World
Championships, and practices three
times a week in the union building.
A
nnually, the Imperial
College School of
Medicine Raising and
Giving team organise a
trip to a European city for a night
out;withthisyear’sdestinationbeing
Paris. When this was announced,
the ICSM Boat Club thought, why
take the coach when you can cycle
there for charity instead? It’s only
295km after all!
At 4:45pm on Friday evening,
twelve naïve cyclists set off from
Queen’s Tower for the ride to Paris,
with a target time of under 24 hours.
Initial progress was slow, given the
Friday afternoon rush hour,but after
surviving Tooting and escaping the
M25 we sped into the pitch black
roads of the South-East. Shortly
before our first scheduled stop with
our supporters (Tom and Luke),
we suffered our only two punctures
of the journey. After a quick repair
we set off in search of Newhaven;
100km and five hours after leaving
IC we reached the ferry, ready to
catch a couple of hours of poor sleep
on the four hour crossing.
At 4am (Local Time), we
disembarked at Dieppe,ready for the
195km leg of the journey. Despite
an initial navigation error, we made
good progress through the short
hours and sub-zero temperatures
along the Avenue Verte. The sun
was, finally, seen after about 100km
and, energised by a sweltering 3o
C,
a chain gang was formed through
the French countryside. Suddenly
finding ourselves just 40km outside
of Paris, entering Poissy, we stopped
for a final food, toilet and caffeine
stop and were ready for the final
push. Central Paris and the Eiffel
Tower remained in our sights as we
took the ‘scenic route’ via the Bois
de Boulogne, but eventually, with
Tom, Luke and the Van behind us,
we rolled up the Champs-Élysées
towards the Arc de Triomphe and it
was all over.
21 hour and 54 minutes of
pain, dodgy banter and freezing
temperatures were all well worth
it for the tremendous total of over
£1100 for RAG. To support us
further, please consider donating
