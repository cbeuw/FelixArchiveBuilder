THE STUDENT NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON
ICSMSU President
Alex Chippy Compton
H
ey guys, me again! Vote
Alex Chippy Compton
for ICSMSU President
and maybe I’ll stop
spamming you with yet another
campaign…
We face a time of challenge. We
need passionate and experienced
leadership to sustain ICSMSU's
unique identity and build a strong
foundation for the future of our
union. My wide-ranging work on
the SU and a variety of committees
and representation of ICSM, both
internally and externally, has given
me the crucial skills and knowledge
needed for this job.
• I have begun discussions with
other medical schools and key
ICSM faculty members which
have opened valuable channels
for academic development. I will
build on these to explore how we
can engage all of you in curriculum
development and to support the
implementation of Sofia, the new
curriculum map, for you.
• I will strengthen our Welfare
Committee so it can deliver effective
assistance wherever needed,
including providing targeted help to
international students and a more
active response to LGBT+ and
diversity concerns.
• I will review our events calendar to
incorporate your feedback into what
we currently do and explore hosting
new, exciting events like Mum's &
Dad's ice skating and an ICSM
outing to Thorpe Park.
• I have in-depth knowledge of all
our clubs and societies from my
roles as SU Treasurer and Clubs &
Societies Officer. I will use this to
help maintain their traditions while
widening student participation and
involvement.

Moving forward together to build
a stronger ICSMSU.

CSM has a thriving
community, one which I want
to promote and improve.
Together, we can achieve our
potential and set a precedent for
the future. We pride ourselves on
the diversity of services we provide,
internally, and more recently,
externally. However, we are now
more aware of our identity in recent
times. I think I have had a lot of
experience to see what ICSM can
become in the future. I love ICSM
and I want us to fulfil and exceed
our potential. we need a focused
President to facilitate this well and
direct what we can do together to
achieve this.
My core vision focuses on
community and identity. Broadly, I
aim to:
- Continue current work (e.g.
Junior Doctor contracts, housing)
- Improve our relationship with
College and ICU
- Identify other issues via open-
door meetings and open forum
discussions
- Promote what we, as a
community, do
- Advertise the outcomes of
meetings and welcome feedback on
them
- Oversee the development of the
new Reynolds Bar
- Continue work on the
Curriculum Review
- Work to improve Sofia
- Dedicated open-door policy
- Promote awareness of issues
such as funding and mental health
- Plan for the future.Maintain our
identity in the face of adversity
- Facilitate the running of our
clubs and societies to ensure they
thrive
Together, we can make ICSM
great.Thanks for reading.

Usama Asif
Council Chair

L
astyearasDeputyPresident
(Clubs&Societies) I sat on
both Council and Trustee
Board. I therefore have
relevant experience for Council
Chair where the role provides a vital
channel of information between the
two.
Ensuring all members of Council
understand the relevance of their
role on the board from the very
beginning will hopefully tackle
some of the issues with quoracy
currently faced. I feel my broad
experience training officers could
be used effectively to hold training
sessions for the Ordinary Members,
Liberation officers and other subsets
of roles on Council alongside
relevant staff from the Union.
One of the most important
functions of Council Chair is to pass
information back and forth between
Council and Trustee Board. Having
sat on both boards previously I
know how to summarise the issues
discussed and pass on key points
to relevant audiences rapidly and
succinctly.
As Council Chair, particularly
when it comes to difficult meetings,
it is important that the loudest voice
in the room is not the only one
heard, and also that the discussion
is not allowed to loop back on itself.
This is a skill I built as DPCS last
year.
Council Chair empowers students
to discuss issues that they care about
with the highest levels of the Union.
I would work with students to ensure
their papers are polished ready
for discussion and ensure they are
comfortable and prepared to present
to the sometimes intimidating
membership of Council.

C
ouncil meetings are the
chance for your voice to
be heard throughout the
year and to shape the
Union into what you want it to be.
As someone that has been going
along to Council meetings for four
years, I have seen Council make big
decisions and also get stuck arguing
in circles.
In my role this year as Recreational
Clubs Committee Chair, which has
a position on Council, I know first
hand how much Council can make
a dramatic influence on lives of
students and the crucial role that the
Chair has on making this happen.
As part of this role, I have been
pushing to ensure that the Union
makes its work available to you,
allowing you and your clubs to be
informed about what the Union is
doing and where it is planning on
going. I will continue to enable your
voice and opinions to shape the
Union and its future.
As Council Chair I would act to
make Council a body that effectively
represents you and that the new
Officer Trustees hear your opinions
on the matters that are important to
you.
I would also work to bring the
activities of the Trustee Board to
wider consideration to ensure that
the whole Union is able to have
valuable input into their work and
the long-term planning of the
Union.This will help ensure that the
Union continues to represent and
support you in the best way it can
throughout your time at Imperial.

Union Council is one of those
little known and heeded necessities
of running a Students Union that
has so much to offer. It brings
together student reps from across
the College, many of whom you
are currently electing, to weigh in
on how the Union should focus its
time and efforts to best meet your
needs as students of a world-class
institution.
I’ll admit, I'm no constitutional
nerd like some of my Council
colleagues, but I can learn. As
Council Chair, I want to make
Union Council a more visible and
interesting body that acts to hold
next year’s officers and sabbaticals
to account.
I'm sitting on the Council this
year as an Ordinary Member for the
Faculty of Natural Sciences and have
gained a working understanding of
the Council and feel that I can step
up to manage and lead the Council
in its duties next year. During my
time at Imperial, I've also been
an academic representative in the
Chemistry Department, meaning I
have the experience in representing
students.
I’ll aim to address the challenge of
lowturnoutforcouncilbyconsulting
voting members further in advance
to ensure effective meetings, and
opening more motions to email
votes to ensure the important
business of Council can occur even
when we cannot physically meet.
Sound good? Vote for me; you
can't go wrong!
