Video games: Teaching us about the future
How video games can make us question our lives and relate to the circumstances of other others.
G
ames are pri-
marily a form of
entertainment
to most people;
a unique way to pass the
time. However they can
sometimes do a bit more
than that. Depending on
the game and at which
point you’re in, games can
teach us important things
about society and empa-
thy. Heck, they could even
be considered character
building in a sense.
Consider a small child,
a child who has yet to
experience the misfor-
tune of loss in their life.
They’re playing a game
like Final Fantasy for
example. And they reach
a point where one of the
characters dies and cannot
come back for the rest of
the game. The child may
try all sorts of tricks to
reverse this outcome, but
at the end of the day, they
have to realise they must
move on and look to the
“They can
highlight
things like the
harsh realities
of war”
“Games can
speculate over
developments
that are yet
to come and
shape the
future”
In a more contempo-
rary and mature example,
let’s have a look at the
game This War of Mine.
In this game, you control
different civilians during
a war. The characters
have no experience with
fighting or combat, their
only goal is to survive.
At one point in the
game, you’re gathering
supplies and pondering
your next move when you
hear a conversation next
door, although saying
“conversation” would be
being polite. A soldier is
being aggressive with a
woman and threatening
to rape her. The character
you’re controlling is only
armed with a shovel; the
character also has three
people who are dependent
on him. If you’re able to
leave safely, then those
people will be able to
survive for longer. What
do you do? It’s an intense
and gruelling decision
and this game is just full
of these complex choices.
While playing a game
like this can emotionally
wreck you, they can
highlight things like the
harsh realities of war and
the plight of those unfor-
tunate individuals who
are trapped in difficult
circumstances where they
can’t see an easy way out.
Games can not just help
us emphasize with par-
ticular situations but also
make us ask questions
about society. Science
fiction, in particular, is
an interesting concept to
play around with in media
because of the way tech-
nology is becoming more
prominent in our daily
lives. Compared to other
forms of media, you’re
able to play a persona by
yourself in a video game.
You step into the shoes of
a multitude of characters
(literally if you’re playing
a VR game) and you get
to experience how you’re
treated, what impacts
your choices have, and
much more. It can get you
thinking on what kind of
person you are and how
different things can affect
your lives.
Detroit: Become
Human attacks the current
status quo and makes
gamers recognise the
faults within society, and
even within themselves.
It has only been out for a
few weeks but it’s already
been gaining a massive
following. I’ll try not to
go into too many spoilery
details but, essentially, the
game makes a statement
on what technology does
to us and what it means
to be human. It features
a society that has become
so dependent on societal
approval that CEOs
are regarded more as
celebrities than business
owners, where a single
step out of turn can break
up the company. It’s a
bit of an extension of
current society, where
there’s a focus on a form
of hedonism as opposed
to personal growth or
sustainability. What’s the
point of taking pictures of
food? Just to show off and
have others look at our
achievements, right?
Games can speculate
over developments that
are yet to come and shape
the future; they make us
introspect about hard, real
life questions. By having
the events of a game in
an alternate world or a
near-distant future, we can
draw parallels with our
world. Deus Ex: Human
Revolution in particular
deals with transhumanism
and the disparity of wealth
in society. The main char-
acter is someone who goes
beyond what it means to
be a regular human with
augmentations and body
upgrades. Throughout
the game, we also get
glimpses of the under-
classes who are left behind
and complaining simply
because they cannot
afford augmentation. We
see how this disparity
affects society, the good
and the ugly, with the rich
rising to the top ranks.
Human Revolution puts
us smack in the middle of
the situation and makes us
examine the effects of this
particular technology first
hand.
Ultimately games are
more than just a story-
telling device and an
entertainment medium.
The fun and awesome
gameplay can be juxta-
posed with societal themes
and character questions.
They provide a canvas to
explore questions about
our world and teach us
more about different situ-
ations people experience.
Sure, there will be people
who won’t be able to
take home the important
message, but it will reach
a lot of people – including
you, if you remember to
look for it.

future. In that moment,
the child would have a
brief understanding of
loss and could probably
relate to their peers who
have experienced it. Now
I’m not saying that losing
a virtual character is the
same as losing a loved
one in real life, but at least
there can be a small degree
of understanding from the
video game, which can
ultimately be the first step
in empathy.
