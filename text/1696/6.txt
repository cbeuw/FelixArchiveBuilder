Bringing in a new era of healthcare data
G
DPR is in full
effect, and
t e c h n o l o g y
companies are
sweating to work out
the appropriate strategy
to comply with new
regulations governing
digital data. However,
amidst this data frenzy
around our web footprint,
a new conversation
around a different kind
of data is taking place:
healthcare data! Big data,
AI, and analytics have
made a buzz in all busi-
ness sectors today. Their
rising importance has
also captivated leaders in
medical technology.
Medical science was
once the science of ob-
servation. Today, it is the
science of data. More and
more healthcare facilities
are focused on collecting
largesetsofdatafromtheir
patients using a myriad of
measurements, including
genetic sequencing, whole
body imaging, and metab-
olomics, to name a few.
This makes it possible to
understand a patient’s test
results in the context of
the whole body, as well
as observe and understand
its progression over time,
leading led improvements
in both prognosis and di-
agnosis of many diseases.
The idea of systems
medicine (personalised
medicine) dates back to
the days of the human
genome project in the
early ‘90s, where it was
well understood that many
diseases have a genetic
basis. If we could read the
entire genome of a person,
then we can identify the
genetic peculiarities in
them, and understand the
causes of the disease.
Today, it is well
accepted that genome
alone is not the complete
repository of everything
which happens in the
body. There has been
rapid improvements in
technologies which can
quickly measure com-
plementary properties
like proteome, transcrip-
tome, and metabolome
alongside digitisation of
medical records. These
changes are driving a new
era in the digitised foot-
print of medical records.
These technologies are
currently still very expen-
sive, though some of them
are more widely used than
others. The most prom-
inent example of such a
technology is Magnetic
Resonance Imaging, a
technique which can be
used to measure metabo-
lome.
However, the cost of
these devices is quickly
reducing. The first human
genome cost ~ $3 billion
to sequence, but now the
industry cost of sequenc-
ing is down to $1000.
Though the cost of genetic
testing is still beyond
the regular means of an
average earning person,
celebrities like Angelina
Jolie have benefited from
systems medicine by un-
dergoing genetic testing
for susceptibility to breast
cancer and subsequent
preventive surgery.
Precision medicine has
become the talk of the
town in healthcare with
every pharmaceutical
giant investing heavily
in it. The rise in data
has brought the need for
software, web pipelines,
and databases to store the
data, as well as new al-
gorithmic based methods
to analyse them. Google,
Microsoft, and Apple
have all started investing
heavily in healthcare.
Google, under its parent
company, has developed
a separate division named
Verily, specialising in the
medical sector. Micro-
soft, with its ‘Microsoft
in Health’ initiative, is
partnering with healthcare
experts to provide robust
digital infrastructure for
their data storage, trans-
mission, and analysis.
Apple, their longtime
competitor, is also pro-
viding similar services in
the healthcare sector. This
paradigm shift with the
use of digital technology
is making the medicine
sector more accessible to
patients. In an interview
with Mckinsey, Dr. Eric
Schadt, the founding
director of the Icahn
Institute for Genomics
and Multiscale Biology,
explained big data will
play the leading role in
providing personalised or
precise medical solutions
tailored to each patient.
This will be a new era of
medicine!
Exam stress? Time to cure your fear of spiders
I
s the end of term
getting you all
stressed out? The
latest research sug-
gests now may also be
the perfect time to tackle
that fear of spiders…
yes, you heard right –
spiders! A new study
from Professor Oliver
Wolf at Ruhr-University
Bochum has shown
stress can increase ex-
tinction learning, which
unlinks two previously
paired stimuli, and
drives improvement in
anxiety therapies.
Extinction learning is a
key component of expo-
sure therapy, which aims
to reduce anxiety related
symptoms by helping the
brain unlearn fear-related
connections and develop
new ‘safe’ networks. It is
one of the leading strate-
gies for treating anxiety,
post-traumatic stress
disorder, and other related
conditions. The main
problem with exposure
therapy however, is that
it is very dependent on
the situation. This means
that whilst the harmful
connections may be easily
generalisable, the new
‘safe’connections are very
context specific. Since
a therapist’s office does
not effectively mimic the
original situation bringing
about anxiety, there is an
increased likelihood of a
connection reforming, and
the anxiety association
returning.
This study was based
on the fact that many of
these harmful connections
can be formed when the
body is subject to a lot
of stress. Therefore, to
increase the generalisabil-
ity of extinction therapy,
a mild artificial stress
response was used. In the
initial phases of the exper-
iment, participants were
subjected to a mild elec-
tric shock when shown
certain coloured light.
This meant, understand-
ably, that they displayed
anxiety when shown the
lights. Subsequently, one
half of group put their
hands in ice water for
three minutes in order to
provoke a stress response,
while the other half put
their hands in warm water.
Both groups then under-
went exposure therapy in a
different location to where
they had acquired the fear.
Key differences emerged
the next day, with the
‘stressed group’ showing
less relapse of anxiety
when back in the original
location. Previous results
have shown that an injec-
tion of the stress hormone
cortisol can increase the
effectiveness of anxiety
treatment; however, this
study provides important
evidence of an underlying
mechanism and demon-
strated that it can also hold
across different situations.
Besides curing your
deep fear of arachnids,
this study has great im-
plications in psychiatric
medicine, with pharma-
cological trials planned
soon. Further work is
planned by Professor
Wolf’s group to determine
if this stress response can
be used to increase the
effectiveness of exposure
therapy.
