GET YOUR
SHIMMY ON WITH
BELLY DANCING
SOCIETY’S
WORKSHOPS
Feeling a bit tense or
stressed out? Then come
along to Belly Dancing
Society’s workshops this
term! We’ll be running
two sessions over the next
few weeks, both suitable
for beginners, the first
being a belly fitness class
(free) and the second
a Saidi (canes) prop
workshop (£8-10).
Come along to our
Belly Fitness class to
shimmy your cares away
on Thursday 14th
June in
Activity Space 1 from
6:30-7:30pm! Get ready
for pumping music,
strength drills, and belly
dancing (at the same
time!). Belly dancing
requires careful control
of various areas like the
abdominals, obliques,
spine, and neck. It focuses
on moving with the body
instead of contorting it
and has a lot of surprising
health benefits. Aside
from the stress reduction
and relaxation a good
session of exercise can
bring, belly dance also
improves your posture by
strengthen muscles in the
back and relieving tension
in the lower back. While
dancing, your leg muscles
are constantly in use to
stabilise you and give
the impression of gliding
movement which means
the impact on your joints
is minimal.
Moves from this dance
style have quickly been
picked up and used in
fitness classes, as they
work out many areas
at once while feeling
like you’re just dancing
around! The atmosphere
in class is always fun
and enthusiastic ensuring
you’ll leave with a smile
on your face! By focusing
on the fitness aspect, this
class will be primarily
drills and floor exercises
to increase strength and
control. There will also be
an interlude of yoga-like
stretches to improve
flexibility and try and get
rid of the knots that might
have accumulated over
this term. No dancing
experience is necessary;
just come along and have
a bit of fun! It’s complete-
ly free to attend so bring
your friends along for an
exciting evening of dance!
This workshop will be
run by the Belly Dancing
Society’s President, Rani
Mehta as part of the
Dance Imperial summer
workshop programme.
Our second workshop
will focus on a dance
style known as Saidi on
Thursday 21st
June in
Activity Space 1 from
6-8pm. This is a folkloric
dance from the rural area
called Sa’id located in
Southern (Upper Egypt)
and is performed by men
and women at festive
events, such as weddings.
During the workshop we
will cover many basic
steps, foot patterns as well
as technique covered in a
combination (canes will
be provided).
Saidi dancing orig-
inates from a kind of
conflict with sticks
between men to show
their power. It is the oldest
form of Egyptian martial
arts to have survive and is
from the pharaonic times.
The Pharaohs painted this
kind of dance on the walls
of their temples and their
soldiers learned it. At the
time it was considered
to be a form of weapon
training. Over time it has
evolved into purely dance
and incorporated with
other styles of belly dance
to give the Saidi we know
today. This workshop will
be taught by Sureya Bel-
lydance, a professional
belly dance performer,
instructor and choreog-
rapher based in London.
Her passion for belly
dance comes from her
Turkish background. She
has trained in a number of
styles including Oriental
Raqs Sharqi (Egyptian
and Turkish), Classical
Egyptian, Folkloric
Egyptian styles, Turkish
Romany, and Tribal
Fusion, as well as Ballet
and Street dance. Sureya
has been described as an
energetic, vibrant, and
versatile performer who
is keen to share her love
of dance through teaching
around the UK.
