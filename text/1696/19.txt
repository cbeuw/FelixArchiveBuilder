Mix-up over tie clubs leads to Imperial College Union
banning Thai students

Security has been
hired to prevent Thai
students entering
the Union Bar, after a
motion banning ‘Thai
Clubs’ passed.

T
his week Im-
perial College
Union has
banned Thai
students from entering
the Union Building,
following a mix-up at
Union Council.
A paper, proposed by
Gemma Ryan, an Ordi-
nary Member of Union
Council for the Faculty of
Natural Sciences, called
for ‘Thai Clubs’ to be
banned on campus. At the
Council meeting, Ryan
gave an impassioned
speech, saying: “the
time has come for these
elitist drinking societies
to be completely banned.
Seeing groups of men in
ties at the Union Bar on
a Friday night, singing
sexist drinking songs, is
something we should be
ashamed of.”
The motion passed
overwhelmingly, and
the Union immediately
passed on instruction to
their security team to not
allow anyone Thai within
the Union Building.
Clubs – drinking societies
for students and alumni –
instead referred to the 60
million Thai people living
worldwide. It is unclear
how many of these Thai
people have been in the
Union Bar on a Friday
night.
However, reports from
Council members and
Union representatives
make it difficult to deter-
mine exactly why people
voted for the motion.
Patrick Winbers, the
Union’s Vice-Principal
Student Voice Consult-
ant, told Hangman: “We
believe the motion was
raised in error, but the
decision of Union Council
must be respected.
Democracy is never
wrong. We will be raising
a counter-motion at the
next Council session, due
to take place in October.
Until then, Thai students
will not be allowed in the
Union building.”
Reactions from
members of Union
Council were mixed.
Lily Gladlin, one of the
constituent union Welfare
Officers, told Hangman:
“I feel terrible about
voting for the paper. But
what was I supposed to
do? Actually read the
papers I vote on?! Get out
of here.”
Rory Kullers, an Or-
dinary Member for the
Faculty of Engineering,
Thai students are no longer allowed in the Union Bar // Imperial College Union
however, supported the
motion: “Yeah, of course I
read what it said, I’m not
an idiot. But I am racist.”
In a statement for
Hangman, members of
Thai Society condemned
the decision: “We feel
very strongly that Impe-
rial College Union should
not be the place for racist
or discriminatory practic-
es. We will be appealing
the decision at the next
Council meeting. Until
then, our members will
be unable to access the
Union Bar; to be honest,
this doesn’t make that
much of a difference to
us – we don’t visit it, since
it’s always full of weird
old men in ties.”
“Thai Society
said they
didn’t go the
Union Bar
anyway, since
it was‘full of
old men in
ties’”
Hangman believe a
typographical error meant
Ryan’s paper, rather than
referring to the Union Tie

Hangman has
obtained evidence
showing members
of Imperial College
Union’s Book Club
naked in public,
and threatening to
defecate in the British
Library

Editor-in-Chief
O
ne of Imperial
College Un-
ion’s societies
has been sus-
pended pending inves-
tigation, after evidence
came to light showing
them being drunk and
disorderly in public.
Screenshots from
the Imperial College
Book Club’s private
WhatsApp group, leaked
to Hangman, show a
group of students posing
naked in front of Virginia
Woolf’s statue in Tav-
istock Square. Another
photograph shows the stu-
dents, who were dressed
as early 20th
Century
modernists, vaulting over
a wall into the British
Library – in a subsequent
video one student threat-
ens to defecate on a copy
of the Gutenberg bible.
In another video, posted
on the WhatsApp group,
members of the society
can be seen running naked
through Bloomsbury, and
aggressively shouting at
passersby. One student
can be heard yelling at a
pedestrian: “if you think
Finnegan’s Wake isn’t
Joyce’s masterpiece you
can suck my fucking dick
you Ulysses-loving cunt.”
It is believed the group
of students had been on a
pub crawl in memory of
American writer Philip
Roth, who passed away
last month, when the inci-
dent occured.
Hangman spoke to one
member of the group,
who wished to remain
anonymous: “I’m not
against people having fun,
and I’m not a prude – I
mean, I’ve even read On
Chesil Beach – but this
time Book Club went way
too far. I’m embarrassed
to share a mutual love of
Camus with them.”
In a joint statement
between the Union and
Imperial College London,
a representative told
Hangman: “This behav-
iour goes against the
values and expectations
of our student community,
and is completely unac-
ceptable. Everyone has
the right to feel respected
for their literary opinions,
even if they think Bu-
kowski is a good writer.
In response to these
allegations the Union
has suspended the club
pending investigation.”

rampage in London
This week your Visa card
doesn’t work. Must be
because of that big crash!
Nothing to do with how
you’re £800 into your
overdraft.
This week you’ve
finished all your exams,
but you feel compelled
to return to the sweaty
comforting heat of
Central Library. Get some
help.
This week you’re
annoyed your
nominations for
Memeperial to win
Contribution to College
Life at the Union Awards
were completely ignored.
This week the return of
Love Island coincides
with the beginning of
your exam week. Oh
well, you were probably
going to get a third either
way.
This week you start
trying to calculate just
how many portions of
curly fries you bought
over the exam period.
You lost count after a few
minutes and go to the
toilets to cry.
This week you miss the
old Kanye, straight from
the go Kanye, chop up
the soul Kanye, set on his
goals Kanye.
This week you’re a
Design Engineering
student, and you’re
wondering how long
it will be before all the
twats who look down on
you start using your new
building to work in.
This week your exams
are over, and you’re so
happy can focus on the
really important stuff:
Trump’s tweets. You now
feel miserable.
This week you’re a
fresher, and you’ve
finished your first set of
exams. Go you! Now you
just have horrific housing
drama to contend with.
This week you plan
to spend all your
time inside, watching
live-streams of game
announcements from E3
alone and stuffing your
face. A bit like every
weekend then.
This week you’re the
Horoscopes Writer, and
you’re almost going to
miss this when you’re
done. Almost. Not really.
