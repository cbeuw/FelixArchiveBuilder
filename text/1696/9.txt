Can there be art after warfare?
A
ftermath, the
title of the
Tate Britain’s
new exhibi-
tion, which looks at art
produced in Europe after
World War One, was orig-
inally an agricultural term.
It described the growth of
grass and other plants that
followed a harvest – the
sweeping away of the old
creating a space in which
the new could develop and
blossom. It’s an appropri-
ate choice: the outpouring
of violence and horror
that occurred within WWI
paved the way for a com-
pletely different society,
one explored by artists
in a heady combination
of jingoism, misery, and
powerful imagery.
The exhibition begins
with the War still ongoing,
featuring artists from
France, Germany, and the
UK who had gone abroad
to document the destruc-
tion. While this generation
of artist-soldiers may have
been fighting for different
sides, with radically dif-
ferent outlooks, they all
recognised the horrific
waste of war, with the
abandoned helmet coming
to represent loss across all
three countries.
If the First World
War had an official form
of painting, it could be
called the ‘anti-land-
scape’ – a reflection of
the way shells and mines
churned up the beautiful
French countryside,
leaving it pockmarked
and hollow. Charles
Sims’ vast landscape of
trenches stretches along
one wall of the gallery;
its tumultuous topography
looks like a vast wave of
sea foam, with corrugated
iron and crosses sticking
out like the carapaces of
crustaceans. It contrasts
beautifully with William
Orpen’s delicate oil
painting of the trenches,
which is almost bucolic
in its radiance. Elsewhere,
Paul Nash’s ‘Wire’
features a mutilated tree,
surrounded by whorls of
barbed wire that appear
like horrific gashes on the
canvas.
The room is watched
over by a pair of incred-
ible sculptures: Jacob
Epstein’s vulnerable
‘Rock Drill’, truncated
and de-limbed, becoming
a figure of pitiful vul-
nerability; and Wilhelm
Lehmbruck’s ‘Fallen
Man’, whose elongated
limbs convey the horrific
anguish of warfare. Le-
hmbruck, who committed
suicide in 1919 following
military service as a para-
medic, was clearly keenly
attuned to the dehuman-
ising effects of warfare,
and this work crackles
with an energy akin to
Käthe Kollwitz’s ‘Mother
with her Dead Son’. Both
works connect beautifully
with George Grosz and
John Heartfield’s dadaist
work, ‘The Middle-Class
Philistine Heartfield Gone
Wild’, whose mutilated
mannequin highlights the
treatment of veterans in
post-war Europe.
The interaction
between artists and
governments is also
interestingly explored:
Charles Sargeant Jagger’s
sculptures commemorat-
ing those who died in the
Royal Artillery and Great
Western Railway contain
a tension that spills out
in his great tableau of a
scene of a sentry in No
Man’s Land, which is
horrific in its violence. A
nearby Hindenburg Cross,
awarded by the Nazis as
part of their mission to
reconfigure the memories
of WWI, shows how art
and sculpture can be used
for propaganda purposes,
which is reinforced by
Andre Maré’s vulgar
monument to the French
war dead.
As well as scars on the
land, WWI left its impact
on the terrain of both the
body and the psyche.
English works depicting
facial wounds obtained
by soldiers, produced
for medical purposes,
contrast with Grosz’ and
Otto Dix’s brilliantly-un-
settling caricatures of
crippled soldiers, which
are pure nightmare fuel,
and contain a powerful
political message. Conrad
Felixmuller’s lithographs
of soldiers in psychiatric
hospitals bristle with
an unsettling energy,
reminiscent of something
out of The Cabinet of Dr
Caligari.
These dark visions are
revisited in the center-
piece of the exhibition: a
darkened room containing
works from print series by
Otto Dix, Max Backman,
Kathe Kollwitz, and
Georges Rouault. The
prints, which are all from
series the artists produced,
are incredibly poignant,
taking us through the
full gamut of war, from
violence to horror to grief.
Kollwitz’s prints retain
their numbing, tumultu-
ous power, centring on the
women and children who
were left behind.
After this point,
however, the exhibition
starts to lose its narrative
thread. The curators make
the decision to focus
on artists exploring the
impact the war had on
society at large. The issue
with this is that the war
was so large – there is a
reason it was called the
Great War – that any art
produced post-WWI could
be said to have an impact
on artists. Yes, the works
by Winifred Knights and
Meredith Frampton are
beautiful, as are the classi-
cal studies by Picasso and
Derain, but how are they
really related to the First
World War, other than by
virtue of being produced
post-1918?
As the final section
moves towards the
Bauhaus, the decision
to only include artists
from the UK, France, and
Germany comes to seem
strange – these weren’t the
only countries affected by
the war, and by bringing
in art by Oscar Schlem-
mer and others the choice
to exclude Russian artists,
who were hugely influen-
tial throughout Europe,
becomes a striking
omission.
By turns heart-rending
and frustrating, Aftermath
is worth going to for the
prints section alone. The
power of works by the
German artists isn’t quite
enough to sustain the
exhibition through the
latter half – where the
tight curation begins to
unravel – but Aftermath
shows us how beauty can
be obtained even through
tragedy.
The Tate Britain’s new show does a good job looking at how WWI impacted artists, but falls apart at the end.
