we are required to hold accurate contact details for you, including:
• A personal email address
• At least one telephone number

ICXCAC – regicide on the athletics track
O
ver the past
month, Imperial
Cross Country
and Athletics
Club have been fighting
exam doom and gloom
with record-breaking
achievements. It all began
at BUCS Outdoors in
Bedford with one of their
largest ever teams ready to
challenge some of the best
athletes in the country.
Over the three-day event,
Imperial athletes raised
their game to compete
with the other quality ath-
letesondisplay,withmany
finals being worthy of a
national championship
final. The highlight was
fresher Daniel Rowden’s
800m final where he
stormed to a BUCS gold
medal in his first year at
the championship – an
incredible achievement.
He has since run the fifth
fastest time in the UK this
year at the Loughborough
International Fixture.
As usual, Chris Olley
was in excellent form
and stormed to a fifth
place in a stacked 5,000m
field in a time of 14:06.
Niki Faulkner and Max
Thorp stormed to lifetime
best times in the 1500m
and 400m respectively,
while Kate Olding and
Alex Mundell made it
to the semi-finals of the
women’s 800m. Perhaps
the most impressive result
was that the team placed
twelfth out of all univer-
sities, despite Imperial’s
reputation for academia
over sporting prowess!
Further success for the
squad came at the recent
meet in the London Uni-
versities track and field
series final in Battersea.
King’s College had been
dominant in the first two
matches but Imperial had
been gaining momentum.
With a 46-strong team,
ICXCAC managed to fill
almost every event and
were ready to cause a
stir. The first track event
of the day was the 800m
and with 1st
and 2nd
places
in both the men’s and
women’s categories, it
was clear from the off that
they meant business.
Imperial were neck-
and-neck with King’s
throughout the day with
tensions rising and jocular
banter flowing between
the athletes. Imperial’s
team went on to win 13
events across the day. The
last event of the day was
the medley relay which
consisted of two legs (one
male and one female)
across each of the follow-
ing three distances: 200m,
400m and 800m. With so
much to play for, the team
knew the pressure was on.
Ultimately it came down
to the last few metres
but fresher James Millett
kept his cool and crossed
the line in first ahead the
King’s athlete who has
his fair share of GB vests.
This not only ensured
that Imperial would bring
home the freshly minted
medley relay trophy but
also won them the match
by a margin of just three
points! This slim victory
really highlights the im-
portance of every single
Imperial athlete from the
total beginners to those
champions that medalled
in multiple events. This
was Imperial’s most
successful result since the
LUCA Outdoors champi-
onships began!
However, the most
important race of the day
must not be forgotten. The
mascot race is a hugely
valued tradition where
ultimate, beautiful glory
or pure, humiliation and
shame is at stake. Victoria
the Lion (Albert had other
business to attend with
some rowers) achieved a
solid 3rd
to finish on the
podium, cementing Impe-
rial’s position as a big deal
on the athletics scene.
With the end of the
university track season
ending the club wishes to
thank Athletics Captain
Max Thorp for his com-
mitment throughout the
year that has brought
Imperial their most
successful track and
field season in memory.
Special thanks also go
to former captain Matt
Douthwaite for organising
the London University
Athletics Series, and to all
the volunteers who helped
ensure the season was a
great success.
