That Summer: The revenge of Grey Gardens
I
n terms of Great
American Mysteries,
the story of the
Beales ranks up there
with Lindbergh’s baby or
the Black Dahlia. Why
and how, exactly, did ‘Big
Edie’ and ‘Little Edie’
Beale, the mother-daugh-
ter duo, lock themselves
inside their decrepit man-
sion in the East Hamptons
for decades, slowly accu-
mulating the oppressive
weight of squalor, rubbish,
and hostility from wealthy
neighbours?
Brothers Albert and
David Maysles were the
first to shine a light on
the pair in their seminal
cinéma vérité film Grey
Gardens, which has gone
on to inspire an HBO
drama and a Broadway
musical. The two Edies
have become a cultural
touchstone, not only for
what they said – Little
Edie: “I only care about
three things: singing,
dancing, and the Catholic
church” – but for what
they represented. As all
romantics know, there is
beauty found in ruins.
That Summer, a doc-
umentary from Swedish
director Göran Olsson,
helps to fill in some of the
gaps left by the original
film, making it a must-see
for any Beale enthusiasts.
Like his earlier film,
Concerning Violence,
the work consists mainly
of found footage – the
majority from the
Maysles, along with some
from Andy Warhol and
Jonas Mekas. The film
provides an invaluable
insight into the develop-
ment of Grey Gardens:
Peter Beard, artist and
friend of socialite Lee
Radziwill (herself the
sister of Jackie Kennedy)
hired the Maysles to shoot
footage of the redevelop-
ment of the Grey Gardens
estate, and the two eccen-
trics at its centre. The film
was eventually scrapped,
although the Maysles ob-
viously returned to shoot
their masterpiece – with
or without the consent of
Beard or Radziwill, it’s
never made clear.
That Summer presents
us with the four extant
reels of film from that
early project, giving us a
peek behind the curtain
of the mansion. Unfor-
tunately, we are forced
to sit through a sequence
of Beard pontificating on
his celebrity connections
before we are able to get
to experience the grainy
majesty of the reels.
As with the Maysles,
Olsson allows the Beales
to speak for themselves,
uttering lines that are
innately brilliant, by
turns hilarious, poignant,
and beautiful – they are
a scriptwriter’s dream.
While the reels run to
little more than an hour
in length, they provide a
wonderful companion to
the original film. Fans of
Grey Gardens will delight
in sequences that preempt
its key themes – Racoons!
Singing! Little Edie’s
outfits! – but for every
answer the film provides
more questions are raised:
were the Maysles being
exploitative? Why did
Little Edie allow herself to
become a recluse? What’s
with all the headscarves?
That Summer provides
a long-overdue update
on the iconic East Coast
eccentrics; let us hope
more footage is unearthed
one day.
François Ozon’s sexual thriller fails to ignite
W
ith Amant
D o u b l e ,
there is the
sense that
French director François
Ozon is returning to
where he is most comfort-
able: sexual psychodrama.
While Ozon’s filmog-
raphy has some notable
exceptions – the high-
camp comedy Potiche
among them – he seems
to be most at home when
straddling the line be-
tween erotica and horror.
Now, after several films
that explored different
genres, he has gone back
to his roots, ploughing
the same furrow of some
of his best works: Under
the Sand, Swimming Pool,
and In the House.
Amant Double is,
therefore, a double disap-
pointment, both for what
it is, and the realisation
of what it could have
been. Marine Vacth plays
Chloé, a withdrawn young
woman suffering from
stomach pains, which
doctors insist are psycho-
logical in origin. She sees
a charming young psy-
chiatrist, Paul (Jérémie
Renier), who calls off
their sessions after falling
in love with her, thus
allowing them to begin a
physical relationship. Of
course, their happiness
cannot last for long, and
– after happening to see
a man who looks exactly
like Paul – Chloé stumbles
upon his identical twin
brother Louis, also a psy-
chiatrist, with whom she
embarks on an affair. Paul
denies the existence of
Louis, and, as she tries to
uncover the truth, Chloé
veers closer and closer to
hystria.
Stylistically, this is
Ozon at his most indul-
gent, taking cues from
Bergman, Hitchcock, and
Cronenberg to create a
tableau of imaginative,
thrilling images. The
opening sequence, which
replicates Psycho’s
drain-eye cut with a far
more intimate part of the
anatomy, is worth the ad-
mission price alone, as is
the introductory analysis
sequence, in which split
screens show the same
sequence from different
angles, disrupting the idea
of the camera-as-eye.
In terms of the plot,
although based on a Joyce
Carol Oates short story,
Ozon borrows liberally
from classics such as
Vertigo and Rosemary’s
Baby. He even puts
Myriam Boyer in as a
wonderfully invasive
neighbour, with shades of
Ruth Gordon’s imposing
matriarch. Unfortunately,
while the sexual elements
may be subversive, little
else is. While films like
Rosemary’s Baby explore
the way women’s lived
experienced are written
off as hysteria, Ozon only
partly tackles this idea. He
ends up reinforcing boring
ideas around pregnancy
and neurosis.
Vacth has developed
since her role in Jeune et
Jolie, but still retains an air
of impassive hauteur that
can be difficult to enjoy.
Renier is much stronger,
playing both twins with
equal aplomb, despite
opposing personalities.
Amant Double is a
lot of fun, and – while it
could certainly do with
a sharp trim – most of it
rattles along at an enjoy-
able, campy pace. By
ratcheting up the drama to
ten pretty much from the
off, however, Ozon loses
us long before the credits
roll.
