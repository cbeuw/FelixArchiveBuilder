u n i v e r s i t i e s
have withheld
over £8 mil-
lion in salaries from
staff members who par-
ticipated in this year’s
strikes, with further
deductions planned for
the near future.
A series of Freedom of
Information requests to
Russell Group universities
revealed those whose staff
took part in the University
and College Union (UCU)
industrial action have
withheld £8,248,376 from
academic and support
staff thus far. Further
deductions will take the
total retained by Russell
Group universities to over
£10 million.
Russell Group uni-
versities are planning
to deduct an average of
over £800,000 from the
salaries of staff who took
part in the strike, which
ran for four weeks in Feb-
ruary and March. Imperial
College London withheld
just under £280,000 from
staff in March and April;
this number is likely to
increase in the coming
months.
Imperial College has
withheld a full day’s
pay for each day a staff
member took part in the
strike, defined as 1/365th
of their annual salary. The
College has also withheld
25% of a day’s pay for
Action Short Of a Strike
(ASOS) – working to con-
tract, and refusing to cover
for absent colleagues or
reschedule classes – al-
though it says it “reserves
the right to review this
percentage should the
dispute escalate”.
In a statement, the
College said money
retained from striking
staff “have been retained
by the relevant academic
departments to support
their efforts to mitigate
the impact of the strikes.”
A large proportion of
other Russell Group uni-
versities have ring-fenced
the retained salaries for
student support: UCL is
donating the money to the
UCL Financial Assistance
Fund for students, while
the University of Durham
is paying the money into
the Student Hardship
Fund. The University
of Manchester is using
some of the money to
waive its gown hire fee at
graduation.
A spokesperson for Im-
perial College UCU said
they were still waiting
to hear about the total
amount to be deducted
from their members:
“UCU is still awaiting a
response from manage-
ment on the total amount
of money that wasn’t paid
to those who participated
in the UCU strike over
USS pensions. We also
asked for this money to
be used to help students
directly by transferring
it to the student hardship
fund. However we’ve
learned that the money
has been kept within in-
dividual departments but
