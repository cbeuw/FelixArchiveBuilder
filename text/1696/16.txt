Disoriental – A multi-generational study of identity
Négar Djavadi’s debut novel explores the history of a single family living through revolutionary Iran, mediating
on how language can help carve a space of belonging.
T
he father of a
friend of mine
has a story about
growing up
between cultures. Born
in England to a Greek-
Cypriot family, he lived
in London until he was
a few years old, before
going to Cyprus for about
six months. Surrounded
by family members, all
chattering away in Greek,
the English he had man-
aged to pick up in his first
few years of being verbal
vanished, to be replaced
by the language of his
extended family. When
he returned to London, he
needed to relearn English
all over again; at this
young age, he was made
aware not only of how he
was viewed as ‘foreign’
by fellow children and
parents, but also how
language can delicately
tie you to a sense of time
and place.
This anecdote was
what came to mind when
reading Négar Djavadi’s
debut novel, Disoriental.
First published in 2016
in French, it has now
been translated into
English by Tina Kover
for Europa Editions; this
translation adds another
layer of meaning to a
novel already steeped in
questions of belonging
and history. Disoriental
is a story about identity,
or – rather – the effects of
a lack of identity.
The central character is
Kimiâ Sadr, one of three
sisters born to a family
of intellectuals living
through the tumultuous
Iranian revolution. We
open the novel with her
sittinginafertilityclinicin
Paris, awaiting the results
of tests; in the quiet of the
waiting room, she begins
to float back through her
own memories, exploring
the story of her family,
tracing its generations.
“There’s more
than a hint
of magical
realism in
Djavadi’s
descriptions of
the Sadrs”
“For a debut
novel,
Disoriental
is hugely
impressive”
There’s more than a
hint of magical realism
in Djavadi’s descriptions
of the Sadr family, which
reaches far back into the
history of Iran. We have
children born in harems,
regressive sky-blue eyes
marking out genetic
lineage, multi-generation-
al conflicts, and a set of
six brothers spread across
the globe. It’s dizzying,
brilliant stuff, but Djavadi
manages to keep a tight
enough hand on the plot
to prevent it spiralling out
into absurdity.
Djavadi is particularly
good at balancing the
surreal with the real. Her
heady descriptions, which
have a mystical air, are
kept grounded by refer-
ences to the real-world
turmoil going on around
them: on one page, she’ll
build up the image of
Kimiâ’s mother Sara and
her neighbour as fated
twins – “The children had
the comforting sense of
having to mothers…one
brunette mother, Sara,
who worked and knew
how to console and to
listen; and another, who
varied between chestnut,
blonde, and sometimes red
hair, Big Mina, who didn’t
work and who organised
games and enormous
afternoon snacks.” – and
then undercut this with
a direct reference to
the impact of American
oppression on Iranian
culture. “Imperialism is
no joke!” Djavadi says
with a sly grin.
In this sense, Disori-
ental reminded me most
of some of the best work
of Salman Rushdie and
Isabel Allende, which
balanced political seri-
ousness with the impos-
sible lightness of magical
realism.
Of course, we know
from the off that Kimiâ
has now made it to Paris,
and left her homeland
behind, unable to return,
meaning the grounding
work Djavadi does with
her family narrative
makes the point of de-
parture that much harder.
Djavadi draws on her
own life in these sections,
having travelled across
the Kurdistani mountains
with her sister and mother,
after her family opposed
the Khomeini regime.
Once the family make
it to Paris, Djavadi mag-
nificently explores how
language not only allows
for communication, but
allows for identity. Kimiâ
is “confronted by a world
that I could see and touch
but didn’t know how to
talk about” – robbed of
the means of describing
words “from peaceful
lives, lives that belong to
the people living them.”
Depression, for Kimiâ, is
a word “whose meaning
I finally understood in
Paris”, highlighting both
the isolating effect of
becoming the ‘other’, and
the way concepts don’t
always translate between
languages.
Kover, however, has
done well to bring Dja-
vadi’s vivid prose to the
English language, which
is studded with brilliant
imagery, like a clove
studded orange: at the
clinic an intern “tosses a
name into the damp, stuffy
air of the waiting room
and disappears”, while her
blue clothing “accentuates
my olive skin and makes
me look like an overripe
eggplant.”
Structurally, the novel
has a couple of issues.
Djavadi spends so much
time describing previous
generations of the Sadr
family, that the present
becomes like a reverse
black hole: as we get
closer to it, things start
to speed up. Kimiâ’s life
after the family’s move
to Paris seems truncated,
with vast swathes seem-
ingly lost or looked over.
Similarly, towards the
beginning of the novel
Djavadi establishes a
series of questions that
need to be answered by
the end of the book – they
all are, but mostly right at
the end of the book, giving
the impression they were
an afterthought.
For a debut novel,
Disoriental is hugely im-
pressive. It’s a bold, imag-
inative piece of work, one
that – in its interrogation
of what we mean by
identity and belonging –
leaves us enriched on the
other side.
