San Francisco is one of the most famous cities in the world, and is truly worth paying a visit should you find
yourself touring the West Coast of the USA. Here’s a quick guide of things to do and see in the city and beyond.
Getting around
C
omparedtomany
famous cities in
the States, San
Francisco is rel-
atively small, so you can
easily get around by foot.
However, to get a more
authentic experience you
might want to opt for cy-
cling, which has become
increasingly popular in
the past few decades –
there’s even a Bike to
Work Day in May! There
are cycle lanes every-
where across the city,
including the Golden Gate
Bridge. I found a deal to
rent a bike for $13 for 24
hours (helmet and lock
included), and spent the
day cycling to and across
the Bridge, exploring the
Sausalito city on the other
side, and coming back just
in time to catch the sunset
over the ocean. Besides
being fun and all, a day
of cycling also proved to
be good cardio – the city
is so hilly that I could
easily skip all my leg days
that month (JK, I don’t
exercise).
City landmarks
The pride of the city –
the Golden Gate Bridge –
offers mesmerising views
of the Bay on one side and
the Pacific Ocean on the
other, with many white
yachts ‘decorating’ the
blue waters. According
to Google Maps, crossing
the bridge by foot takes
around 30min (I wouldn’t
know because I cycled, i.e.
sat still on the bike while
the strong ocean wind was
pushing me forwards).
The east pavement is used
exclusively by pedestri-
ans, while cyclists have
access to both sides.
Another famous attrac-
tion is Lombard Street,
the so-called ‘crookedest
street in the world’ that
Exploring San Francisco: the Golden City by the bay
winds down a steep hill
in sharp turns, surrounded
by patches of greenery
and blossoms. You can
also check out Telegraph
Hill – filled with beautiful
fauna, it overlooks the
Bay and is home to Coit
Tower.
San Francisco also
has the world’s largest
Western Chinatown, more
popular among tourists
than the Golden Gate
Bridge. Besides numerous
food and souvenir shops,
bars, and restaurants, you
can enjoy the views of
colourful Chinese-style
buildings as well as
awesome street art on
every corner. My personal
favourites were a wall
decorated with red enve-
lopes and a huge mural
representing all Chinese
Zodiac signs.
Another interesting
landmark is the city hall,
which reminded me a bit
of St Paul’s Cathedral. It’s
also close to a neighbour-
hood containing Victorian
houses that have been
beautifully re-painted in
various colours and are
famously known as the
“painted ladies”. I visited
the place late at night
so I didn’t get to fully
appreciate the colours,
and the park nearby felt
a bit dodgy, but I enjoyed
the breath-taking views of
the city skyline unfolding
behind the low-rise Victo-
rian buildings.
Finally, you can visit
Union Square, a busy and
vibrant place with shops,
restaurants, and bars,
where you can chill in the
evening. And you simply
can’t miss Fisherman’s
Wharf, especially Pier

39 where you’ll find sea
lions (you’ll immediately
recognise the distinctive
noise and smell) as well
as cute souvenir shops and
cafes.
Paid attractions
San Francisco also
prides itself on its cable
cars, which had served
as the main means of
public transport before
buses were introduced.
There are currently three
lines left, and they are
used by both tourists and
local commuters. You can
also visit a free-of-charge
museum of cable cars to
learn more about their
history and importance.
And of course don’t
forget to visit Alcatraz
– the infamous former
prison for world’s most
dangerous criminals,
known for being impos-
sible to escape from. The
guided tour (about $40)
includes a ferry ride from
the city to the Alcatraz
Island and back, and an
informative audio guide
with stops all over the
prison.
Outside the city
If you opt for cycling
across the Golden Gate
Bridge, you can visit
Sausalito city on the other
side. It resembles Nice,
France and is therefore
sometimes called Califor-
nia’s French Riviera. You
can also visit the Black
Sands Beach if you want
to see and walk on some
black sand.
If you still have some
time left, you can go
south to visit Stanford
University. The campus is
larger than any university
campuses I’ve seen in the
UK, it’s almost a town
of its own: they have
shopping malls, a massive
stadium and pools, a
church, and more. The
lawn in front of the main
entrance is incomparable
to our cute and tiny
Queen’s Lawn. It can take
a while to walk across the
campus, so students get
around by cycling or by
one of the many shuttle
bus lines. I happened to
visit on the UG arrival
day which left me with
all kinds of nostalgic feels
as I reminisced about my
first weeks at Imperial.
Further south, in
Mountain View, which is
a part of Silicon Valley,
you can find many famous
high tech companies and
their campuses, a future
workplace for some of us.
I visited the Googleplex,
where staff members cycle
between buildings on
bikes painted in Google’s
colours. You can’t get
inside the buildings as a
visitor unless you know
anyone who works there
but you can enjoy a walk
outside where you’ll see
many Google-themed
objects, including life-
size Android statues.
However, I would suggest
going there only if you
really have nothing else to
do as it’s not as interesting
as other sights.

Top tips for visiting the Greek Islands on a budget

reaming of
visiting the
Greek Islands
but don’t have
all you need to enjoy
an Instagram-perfect
trip (i.e. money)? Don’t
worry, you can still take
your memorable shots
and experience Greece to
its maximum while trav-
elling on a budget if you
follow the following tips.
Travel off-peak
Or at least avoid July
and August! Prices in
September and October
tend to drop, both for
flight tickets and hotels.
The beach is great that
time of year, and you get
to avoid the extreme heat
of summer (it can easily
get above 30o
C at noon).
However, keep in mind
that (early) September is
also quite hot.
Avoid Mykonos &
Santorini
Although there are
many direct flights to
these islands, which
makes them more easily
accessible, accommoda-
tion is rather expensive
there. If you still wish to
visit them for those mag-
nificent sunsets or their
clear blue beaches, opt
for a nearby island. The
closest (inhabited) island
to Mykonos is Tinos.
Naxos and Siros are also
nearby. For Santorini,
look for accommodation
in Ios or Folegandros.
You can then day-trip to
Mykonos or Santorini!
Check the ferry type
High-speed ferries are
usually more expensive
and may require an
advance booking. Most
ferries also accept cars for
extra cost, unless they are
going to a car-free island,
like Hydra and Kastellori-
zo. On a side note: choose
a seat inside the ferry
if it’s air-conditioned!
Most ferries have both
an indoor and an outdoor
sitting area. Personally,
I would go for an indoor
seat to avoid the summer
heat, especially at noon
(in general, it is advisable
to avoid being outside
between 11am and 4pm),
and spontaneously go out
to take pictures and get
some fresh air. If you sit
outside, bring a hat and
lots of sun cream!
Rent a car, not a boat
If you want to visit
one of those secluded
beaches that you see
online, then you will need
a bit of planning. Most
of them are not easy (or
cheap) to reach. Some of
them require a two-to-
three-hour drive from the
closest city (best case), or
they are only accessible
by boat. Renting a car is
clearly not as expensive as
renting a boat, so opt for a
beach that is accessible by
road and make sure you
know the way there.
Avoid paid beaches
Renting umbrellas and
sunbeds can be quite ex-
pensive on their own. You
can simply cut costs by
going to a beach with free
entry. Even better, bring
your own umbrella and a
folding chair. Don’t forget
to pack your own snacks
too and remember to clean
your space afterwards.
Avoid overpriced
meals
Main meals in res-
taurants usually should
be around €10-15 each.
Street food like souvlaki
or gyros (meat in pita
bread or wrap) costs
even less. Also, be sure
to check the total price
before ordering fresh fish
in restaurants – in many
cases, the price is calcu-
lated by weight and type
of fish (you may also be
able to choose which fish
you want to eat). Before
ordering, ask for the
total price if not shown.
Finally, when travelling
by ferry, you can bring
your own snacks on board
– even though most ferries
have bars with food and
drinks, they are usually
overpriced.
Enjoy the Greek hos-
pitality!
The last tip is not
related to money, but
rather to the basis of your
trip. Wander around the
picturesque streets, taste
the Greek cuisine and
the authentic ingredients
used, talk to the locals,
and take a donkey ride .
Fun fact: If you visited
3 different Greek islands
and islets (both inhabited
and not) every day, you
would need more than
5 years to visit them all.
visitgreece.gr reports that
the total number of Greek
islands and islets is 6,000!
