The Men's Rugby Club
were seen exposing
themselves in public,
being encouraged
to defecate in public,
and making offensive
comments about
immigrants and the
disabled.

I
mperial College
Men’s Rugby Club
(ICURFC) have
been suspended
after evidence emerged
showing the team ex-
posing themselves in
public.
Students were caught
showing their genitals
in front of the Cenotaph,
climbing naked into the
fountains in Trafalgar
Square, and making jokes
about Mexicans and disa-
bled people. The students’
behaviour was described
as “completely unaccept-
able” by both the College
and Imperial College
R
esults are in
for the third
year of the
T e a c h i n g
Excellence Framework
TEF round three: the reckoning
(TEF), which has under-
gone significant changes
following the year two
consultation. Imperial’s
gold rating (awarded in
June 2017) still stands,
though it may not be
directly comparable
with institutions that re-
ceived gold in the 2018
assessment.
Following feedback
from year two partici-
pants, the Department for
Education made a series
of “refinements” to TEF
(which now stands for
the Teaching Excellence
and Student Outcomes
Framework). There are
now six main metrics
(drawn from the National
Student Survey, numbers
of students completing
their course, and numbers
of students in employ-
ment or education six
months post-graduation)
which are intended to test
teaching quality, learning
environment, and learning
gain. Weighting of each
metric has also been
changed: each of the three
NSS-based metrics has
a weighting of 0.5 while
the three non-NSS-based
metrics are weighted as
1.0.
A flag system has
also been introduced to
indicate providers who
are significantly above
or below the TEF bench-
marks for each metric
and is used to form an
“initial hypothesis”. For
each metric a provider
may receive zero, one or
two positive or negative
flags. Providers with
positive flags totalling at
least 2.5 (according to the
new weighting system)
and no negative flags are
initially considered gold.
Institutes with negative
flags amounting to 1.5 or
more are to be considered
bronze, regardless of any
positive flags they may
have received. All other
providers are deemed
silver.
Assessors also consider
supplementary metrics,
such as longitudinal
education outcomes and
grade inflation, as part of
a “holistic judgement”
before issuing the final
award. The rating process
has become so com-
plicated that additional
training may be required
for assessors “without a
background in handling
advanced data”.
About a quarter of
the 231 institutions to
receive a full new-look
TEF award were rated
gold; half took silver and
the remainder were given
bronze ratings. A further
64 education providers
received provisional
awards due to a lack of
data required for a full
assessment.
In addition to institu-
tion-level TEF awards,
a two year trial of
subject-level awards is
underway.

team earlier this week.
Video and photograph-
ic evidence, which had
been shared on a group
WhatsApp chat, was pub-
lished by The Sun earlier
this week.
The photos show the
students, apparently on a
‘Mexican-themed’ night
out, posing naked in front
of the statue of Winston
Churchill in Parliament
Square, covering their
genitals with sombreros.
Other photographs feature
team members exposing
themselves outside the
Royal Albert Hall and
downing bottles of wine.
Videos published by
The Sun show members of
the group nakedly clam-
bering through the foun-
tains in Trafalgar Square.
One student attempts to
climb to the top of the
fountain, while another
says “bonus points if you
get in that saucer and take
a dump”.
Further videos feature
a naked student coming
out of a phone box near
the Cenotaph war memo-
rial, before displaying his
genitals and singing “I’ve
got bigger maracas” to the
onlookers. Another video
shows a student exposing
himself on a public tube
carriage.
Other videos show the
students making offen-
sive comments: in one, a
student in a sombrero and
poncho clambers over a
high wall, while another
shouts “typical immi-
grant”. Another video
allegedly shows a student
trying to dance with a
disabled girl in a night-
club; a comment on the
WhatsApp group reads:
“Poor girl can’t even walk
away.”
The Union suspended
the Men’s Rugby Club
prior to the publication
of the story, which was
quickly picked up by
other news outlets, includ-
ing the Telegraph and the
Independent.
In a statement on behalf
of the Union and the
College, a representative
told Felix: “This alleged
behaviour goes against
the values and expecta-
tions of our student and
staff community and is
completely unacceptable.
Everyone deserves to feel
supported and respected.
The College and Students’
Union continue to work
hard to challenge and
remove all inappropriate
behaviour at Imperial.”
“The Students’ Union
has strict policies in place
regarding the behaviour
of all members of clubs
and societies. In response
to these allegations the
Union has suspended the
club pending investiga-
tion - further disciplinary
action will be taken where
necessary.”
A representative of
ICURFC told Felix: “The
rugby club are deeply
regretful about the behav-
iour which occurred in
this incident and how it
reflects on the university
and members of the club.
We are fully cooperating
with the Union in this
investigation to ensure
an outcome is reached
as quickly and easily as
possible.”
ICURFC will now face
an investigation from the
Union, who will take their
findings to Governance
Committee before the end
of June. The Club will
be suspended until this is
resolved.
This is not the first
time the Rugby Team
have been in the headlines
for stripping in public:
in 2014 the team was
suspended after members
stripped on a public tube
carriage, leading to the
police being called.

mperial College
Union this week
announced their
nominees and win-
ners for the 2018 Union
Awards.
The 14 categories,
including ‘Campaign of
the Year’, ‘Event of the
Union Award nominations and shortlist announced
Year’, and Union Colours
acknowledge the efforts
Union volunteers go to
in order to improve the
student experience at
Imperial.
Nominations for the
Awards are submitted
by students, and student
panels decide on the
recipients of the Awards,
which will be presented
on the 15th
June. This year
over 500 nominations
were made for the Award,
beating last year’s total.
This year three students
will be awarded Fel-
lowships, given to those
who have “continuously
served the Union…over
a number of years”: Milia
Hasbani, Abhijay Sood,
and Lloyd James.
Hasbani, current Chair-
man and former President
of the City and Guilds
College Union, told Felix
she was “honoured and
delighted” to receive a
Fellowship: “I have really
enjoyed volunteering
with the Union in several
capacities, and it’s lovely
to be recognised. It shows
me that all the hard work
I have put in over the
past few years has been
appreciated and was as
worthwhile and beneficial
to the student experience
as I hoped it would be.”
The shortlist for
Campaign of the Year is
between campaigns run
by the Royal School of
Mines Union (RSMU), the
Imperial College School
of Medicine Students’
Union (ICSMSU), and
Muslim Medics/Islamic
Society.
The RSMU ‘LookAfter
Your Mate’ campaign
focussed on advising
students how friends can
support people having a
difficult time at univer-
sity, while the ICSMSU
‘Online Honestly’ cam-
paign saw current and
former students sharing
their true feelings behind
old posts on social media,
leading to genuine and
eye-opening reactions.
Muslim Medics/Islamic
Society have been nom-
inated for their ‘Believe
and Do Good’ campaign;
Jarka Naser, who was in-
volved with the campaign,
told Felix the campaign
aimed to “encourage
unity through performing
selfless acts of kindness;
positively influencing the
local community,” and
“students were able to
be involved in such life
saving measures, from
feeding the homeless and
donating blood, to clean-
ing the community!”
This year saw a number
of new award categories
launched, including ‘New
CSP (Club, Society, or
Project) of the Year’,
whose nominations
include Sign Language,
ICSMSU Coding, and
ICSMSU Women’s
Football. Nominations for
‘CSP of the Year’ include
Pole & Aerial, Muslim
Medics, and Felix. Two
new awards have also
been established to recog-
nise volunteers within the
Wellbeing Representation
Network, which was set
up this academic year.
The most popular
award is Union Colours,
which recognises those
who have “given signif-
icant and repeated out-
standing contributions to
the student experience at
Imperial”. In total, 69 stu-
dents have been awarded
a Colours Nomination.
Mira Davidson, Biochem-
Soc Chair, who has been
awarded Colours, told
Felix: “‘Volunteering for
the Union can be incred-
ibly rewarding.
“[Departmental socie-
ties] will always be there.
It's great to see these soci-
eties and their volunteers
gain recognition, as this
encourages us to keep
doing what we love.”
The Union Awards
ceremony will be held on
15th June.
ends on the 1st

ber 2018.
Prof Haskel said: “I’m
truly honoured to be nom-
inated to the MPC and to
follow Ian McCafferty
who has been such a ded-
icated and hard-working
member over the last six
years, especially with his
work visiting schools. I
look forward to contribut-
ing to the MPC’s vital role
in maintaining the UK’s
price stability and com-
municating its thinking.”
Professor Francisco
Veloso, Dean of Imperial
College Business School
said: “I would like to
extend my warmest con-
gratulations to Jonathan
on this appointment,
which reflects his recogni-
tion as one of the leading
international authorities in
economics. His research
and intellectual leadership
is among the best in our
school and we are hon-
oured to have him in our
faculty.”
Prof Haskel has a
Chair in Economics at the
Imperial College Business
School. He is known
for his book Capitalism
Without Capital: The
Rise of the Intangible
Economy, co-authored
with Stian Westlake, and
his winning entry in the
2017 Indigo Prize, which
asks how we measure
economic activity in a 21st
century economy.
Philip Hammond, the
Chancellor of the Excheq-
uer said: “I am delighted
that Professor Haskel is
joining the MPC. I am
confident that his exper-
tise in productivity and
innovation will further
sharpen the Committee’s
understanding of the
British economy.”
The appointment has
drawn criticism from
women’s rights groups,
after it emerged Prof
Haskel was the only man
in a shortlist of five. A
Women’s Equality Party
spokeswoman said the
decision sent the wrong
message on the commit-
ment of the Treasury to
improve diversity.
Rachel Reeves, Labour
MP for Leeds West and
Chair of the Business
Select Committee – which
oversees the administra-
tion of the Department for
Business, Energy and In-
dustrial Strategy – said it
was “truly staggering that
the Treasury has failed to
appoint a woman to this
role”. She further added:
“The fact that four women
were shortlisted shows
that there are plenty of
capable and well-qualified
women, but yet again
the top jobs seem to be
reserved for men.”
A Treasury spokesman
said: “We are committed
to diversity and encour-
aging the broadest range
of candidates. We actively
contacted 44 women to
apply for this role, 80%
of those interviewed were
women, and the majority
of those on the interview
panel were women. The
final appointment deci-
sion was based on merit.”
The Treasury said that
the appointment was made
by a panel comprised of
two women – Clare Lom-
bardelli, first female chief
economic adviser to the
Treasury and Kate Barker,
former MPC member –
and Richard Hughes, the
Treasury’s director of
fiscal policy.
Earlier this year the
Business School apolo-
gised after a complaint
their Managerial Eco-
nomics module made use
of teaching materials that
"objectified women".
