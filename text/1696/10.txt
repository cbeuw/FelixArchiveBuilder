“When things
are coming
together and
being curated,
what I imagine
are the works
are like
characters in a
story”
time in our lives for other
things is really sad. And
needing that permission
to do it is frustrating.
It’s about giving people
the confidence to do
something creative. It
benefits us just as much as
sports, to keep our minds
and bodies healthy, it’s
the same with arts, with
music, with writing, with
theatre.
F: Do you think hav-
ing something like the
Blyth Centre as a whole
that is semi-institution-
al makes it easier for
students to get that
permission?
M: Yes. It’s very
immediate and very
accessible. Especially in
terms of seeing exhibi-
tions in London. There are
hundreds of exhibitions,
and they’re all in quirky
places, like ‘knock three
times on this unmarked
door.’ You think: ‘is it
going to be good? Will
it be bad? Can I go there
on my own? Will I knock
on the door?’ – you can
come to the Centre and
see a strong cross section
of what’s going on in the
art world.
or three hours – whatever
you want to do – and not
feel you can’t. You’re in a
safe, creative space.
F: Within your own
work, you incorporate a
lot of elements relating
to the body – prescrip-
tion sheets, eyes, teeth.
How do art and science
come together in your
practice?
M: When I was doing
GCSE science, we had to
take something in to look
at under the microscope.
My dad worked in the
hospital, and he brought
me cross-slices of tissues,
saying ‘you can take
those and they’ll be really
interesting to see’. So
there’s always been this
medical understanding of
the body, and this emo-
tional side of the inside
of the body have been
mashed together for me.
An analytical response to
an internal body is very
good counterpoint to an
emotional response to an
internal state, so they play
together and bounce off
each other really nicely. I
enjoy having something
that has to be true and
something that’s very
intuitively felt coming
together.
F: Recently you’ve also
been making artwork
in collaboration with
your son – can you talk
a little bit about how
having a child, and in-
volving him in your
work, have influenced
your practice?
M: Before I had him,
I had two strategies to
making: a loving render-
ing that’s very careful
to get things in a certain
way; and then a much
more emotionally expres-
sive way to work. I would
let those two things smash
together. Looking at my
son’s gestures, he has a
truly accidental gesture
because he had no control
over the marks he was
making. My emulated free
gestures can’t compete
with his. So I thought if I
split my practice, and give
him more of that freedom,
and take on more of the
parental roles within the
art practice then we can
communicate visually
across our different modes
of making.
That explains a lot
more about my reactive,
adaptive, response to
being a mum, being a
person, and being an artist
– my experience of life
carries through into my
work.
F: Do you think your
time at Imperial, being
at this intersection be-
tween art and science,
has influenced your
practice over the years?
M: Absolutely. Defi-
nitely subconsciously,
but then there are certain
shows that really excite
me. Getting to see all this
work come together, and
then coordinate and curate
it. It’s an art form in itself,
bringing things together
like a conductor so I can
understand the story of
how work comes together
and let the viewer see that
as well. It’s a very natural
space for me to be in, this
inbetween, so I’m very
lucky.
F: You mentioned the
curational side of it.
Can you talk about how
you curate a show and
set up the work?
M: When things are
coming together and
being curated, what I
imagine are the works are
like characters in a story.
My job is to introduce the
story, and then let the char-
acters interact in a way
that makes for an exciting
novel, so to speak. So
that’s the first part of the
job, understanding the
work and how it relates
to other work, which is
relative and will change.
Then there’s how the
works behave in the
space. For me, it’s very
anthropomorphic, they
are very living things, so
there are questions like:
how much space do they
need? How much space
between work is needed,
so they’ve got their own
time to breathe and be
processed? It sounds like
I think about these things
consciously, but over the
years it’s become very in-
stinctive – like learning to
drive, it seems mad when
you first hear it, but then
it’s very instinctive.
F: I know you’ve been
here for a lot of shows
– were there any that
particularly stood out
for you?
M: One of my proudest
shows was between
Photography Society
and Leonardo Fine Art
Society. They’d been
doing this hybrid show
for a few years, but there
was just one year where
that really clicked. They
stopped being Photogra-
phy Society on one side
and LeoSoc on the other;
we did a show where we
folded photographs into
origami birds, and they
flew like a flock through
the space. It was beautiful
and really ambitious. It
took a week to install. You
could not tell that wasn’t
a professional show – and
from that point they’ve
interacted really well
together.

It’s the same with
making, that fear of the
blank page – writer’s
block, artist’s block.

Wednesday afternoon and
say ‘I don’t know what to

Clash of Cultures – Mindy Lee
Mindy Lee is an artist and curator of the Blyth Gallery
– the creative hub of Imperial, showcasing various
works from Imperial students and professional artists
throughout the year. In a continuation of the Clash of
Culture series, Fred Fyles, Editor-in-Chief, talks to Mindy
about her work at the gallery and the division between
science and art.

“Working in
the studio and
working in the
lab is exactly
the same”
W
hen I listen
back to the
recording
of my
conversation with Mindy
Lee, artist and curator of
Imperial’s Blyth Gallery,
there’s the faint sound
of piano music tinkling
along in the background.
Mindy’s office is located
in the Blyth Centre, sur-
rounded by music practice
rooms, from which the
sound of students ham-
mering at piano keys
emanate; it has a beautiful
view over the grass of
Queen’s Lawn, where
students have spilled out
to enjoy the warm midday
sunshine. The Blyth
Centre, is, in a number of
ways, the artistic hub of
Imperial College London;
it’s home not only to these
practice rooms, but also to
the Blyth Gallery, a long
white-walled space, where
Imperial students and staff
regularly display their
work. Mindy is its curator,
dividing her time between
organizing shows, putting
on art workshops for staff
and students, and making
her own artistic work.
We caught up with her to
chat about the intersection
between art and science,
as well as the influence
science has had on her
own work.
Fred: Could you tell me
a little bit about your
background, and how
you got involved with
the Blyth Gallery?
Mindy: I’ve always
wanted to be an artist, and
I was born into a family
of scientists, so I’ve been
brought up with a scien-
tific way of processing the
world around me. I was at
the Royal College of Art
from 2002 to 2004, during
which time there was a
commission to celebrate
women in science, which
I won. So I worked with
Imperial for a year to
develop a painting, and
from that I got to know
Richard Dickins, Director
of the Centre. We had a
lot of conversations about
how the Gallery could
stay open, because it was
under threat of closure.
That led to me coming
here as an independent
advisor for a couple of
years, before eventually
getting a permanent
position.
make art, and be taught
for free by myself and
other artists throughout
the year.
F: What do you think
about the societal di-
vision between art and
science? Do you think
such a division does re-
ally exist? How do the
two interact?
M: I think the divide is
imagined, or it’s to do with
not being able to translate
from one language to
another. I think interaction
and influence between
the two happens in three
ways: there’s a direct
interaction, which could
be a collaboration on
projects. The second way
they influence each other
is an indirect way, which
is a cross-pollination of
ideas or conversations
arising between subjects
and disciplines; it’s not
a direct interaction, but
there’s something about
talking around subjects
or research through
exhibitions and work-
shops which triggers a
development. The third
way, which is equally
important, is a separated
interaction, where the art
and the science are apart
– particularly at Imperial,
the scientists are taking a
break from thinking about
their analytical research.
They can concentrate on
using a different part of the
brain, and thinking with
different logic systems
and scenarios. Then when
they come back from
this altered, other way of
spending time, they return
refreshed, and might just
have a breakthrough,
because they’re coming at
the research from a com-
pletely different angle. I
try and provide opportu-
nity for all three scenarios
with the programme here,
so there’s maximum
opportunity for people to
influence each other.
Talking to one of the
PhD students, we came
to the conclusion that
working in the studio
and working in the lab
is exactly the same. It’s
about looking at a set of
information and rules, and
how you explore those
logic systems within your
own practice, whether
that’s an experiment
or a painting. It’s like
translating: the translation
isn’t word for word, but
it’s about the flow of the
language and the nuances
of the language you’re
speaking – it’s the same
with visual and scientific
processes. If you’ve got a
rigorous discipline in one
but it’s light in the other,
then it doesn’t translate as
well as it should. Whereas
if you’ve got a respect
for each language and an
understanding of each
language, then you lose
the barrier, you can flow
between the two really
easily.

F: Could you tell us a bit
about the Blyth Gallery
itself?
M: The Blyth Gallery is
on Level 5 of the Sherfield
Building, and we have
twelve shows a year.Three
are professional shows
by visiting and emerging
artists, who could be Lon-
don-based, or national,
or international. There is
one Royal College of Art
show, and eight shows

eties, medical humanities
students, PhD researchers,
solo staff members, artist

a really nice mix of things
to see in the space.
I also run a studio space,
which is in 153 Roderic
Hill, where students and
staff can come to learn
F: You also run painting
and drawing classes
within the studio. One
thingI’vefoundencour-
aging students to write
is a sense that people
don’t feel they’re ‘al-
lowed’ to be creative
because they’re a sci-
entist. I was wondering
whether that’s some-
thing you’ve found?
M: Yes, there’s a barrier
there in terms of self-per-
mission, absolutely. I’m
mentoring with PhD
students over the summer,
and a lot of students have
said ‘I needed an excuse
to allow myself to make
some art, and this project
has given me that excuse.’
