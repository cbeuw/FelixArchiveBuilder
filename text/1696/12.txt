exploration of the human psyche. Serving wit and darkness in equal measure, Josh Tillman only reaffirms his
lyrical majesty.
A
s a book lover,
it was a won-
derful thing to
discover Father
John Misty. It is simply
impossible to get past the
brilliant lyrics this man
has continuously pumped
out on all four albums
released under this moni-
ker. When listening to the
stories he has to tell, you
are completely immersed
in a child-like trance of
emotional connection.
That said, this does not
mean the musical side can
be neglected when look-
ing at his work. It may
serve mainly as the vessel
within which he can deliv-
er his beautiful words, but
his smooth baritone and
meticulously arranged
compositions are nothing
to scoff at. Now that I’ve
got my confession of love
for the man out of the
way, I can proceed with
the review with a clear
conscience.
Josh Tillman’s work
has been on an upward
trajectory since renaming
himself as Father John
Misty, with every new
album being hailed as his
best work. This new LP is
no different. It’s surpris-
ing how elegantly FJM
is able to discuss the soul
wrenching topics that he
deems important enough
to share with the world,
while also remaining
truthful. The album deals
with loss – of home, of
loved ones, of purpose
– and discusses the
various dark and insidious
imprints this leaves on the
human soul. Sometimes
it feels as though people
who tell stories of sadness
do so sanctimoniously,
feeling their sadness
makes them unique and
special, but that is the
exact opposite of what we
get with Father John.
“The soulful
inquisitor
contemplates
death, with
a feeling like
he has been
cornered into
it”
He gets straight to
the point in the album’s
gloomy opener ‘Hangout
at the Gallows’. The
chorus asks the same
four questions each time:
“What’s your politics?
/ What’s your religion?
/ What’s your intake? /
Your reason for living?”
– these are questions on
a grand scale, questions
everyone must face up
to in their lives, and they
set the tone for the album.
Lacking an answer, the
soulful inquisitor con-
templates death, with a
feeling like he has been
cornered into it – “Whose
bright idea was it to
sharpen the knives? / Just
twenty minutes ‘fore the
boat capsize / If you want
an answer it’s anybody’s
guess / I’m treading water
as I bleed to death.” The
appeal of death in such an
inescapably depressing
existential crisis finally
becomes most apparent in
the lines: “So you wanna
hang out at the gallows?
/ Those guys get an early
start.” A dark opener
indeed.
This is followed by the
brilliant ‘Mr. Tillman’,
where FJM uses his
alter-ego to tell a ridicu-
lously exaggerated story
of the alienated existence
of a musician always
on the move. Hotels
are a constant theme
throughout the album, a
symbol of detachment
and an unbalanced life.
Here, the verses are told
intermittently by a hotel
receptionist worried about
Mr. Tillman’s bizarre
behaviour: “And oh, a
reminder about our policy
/ Don’t leave the mattress
in the rain if you sleep
on the balcony” which
is followed by the elated
response of the apparently
intoxicated subject: “I’m
feeling good / Damn, I’m
feeling so fine / I’m living
on a cloud above an island
in my mind.” The song
has a remarkably catchy
melody and fades out with
the accompaniment of
some careless whistling,
implying the notion of
a mind on the wane or
perhaps merely past
caring.
The lowest point of the
album is ‘The Palace’.
The subject’s desolation
has escalated to complete-
ly new heights, the jokes
are dry and reek of the
harrowing self-contempt
endemic to depression:
“Last night I wrote a poem
/ Man, I must have been in
the poem zone… Maybe
I’ll get a pet / Learn how
to take care of somebody
else / Maybe I’ll name
him Jeff.”
The album’s mood does
pick up after this and ‘Dis-
appointing Diamonds Are
the Rarest of Them All’,
one of the most beautiful
on the album, compares
the crazy, out-of-the-blue
love that sometimes
grabs hold of us to both a
pervert on a crowded bus
and an oil tanker tipped
at sea – an unwanted con-
tamination but, as he says,
“Does everybody have to
be the greatest story ever
told?”
It feels as though the
lyrical subject does indeed
reach some point of rec-
onciliation with his life
at the end of the album.
(“I’m in the business
of living / yeah, that’s
something I’d say”). The
moral lesson he leaves us
with is a powerful one,
it tells of the disillusion-
ment that can come from
planting your feet too
firmly in what you have:
“Beware the man who has
everything / Everything
that he wants… I’m out
here testing the maxim /
That all good things have
to stop.”
Life is hard, there’s no
getting around that, but
I feel that a great deal
of comfort can be taken
from feeling like someone
understands exactly how
you feel. It is not easy to
build such a rapport with
fans that are thousands of
miles away, but in listen-
ing to Father John Misty’s
music you really gain
a sense of the universal
presence of pain – that he
feels the same as you do.
He seems to be moulding
the demons inside him in
clay right in front of you.
His lyrics feel like he’s
having the most honest of
conversations with you.
This has always been a
strong suit of folk music
and with every new album
it feels like FJM’s songs
belong in the vault with
the canonical works of
Bob, Neil, and Graham.

CUSTOMER
Naked, honest, and mildly disappointing
T
hree things I
would like to
clarify before
I begin this
review: I am a Kanye stan
(albeit a realistic one);
this album has grown on
me immensely since my
first listen; and I have
decided to take everything
on this album, especially
the comments on mental
health, as genuine. That’s
not to say I’m excusing
Kanye’s recent pro-Trump
stance or “slavery is a
choice” ramblings, I’m
just saying that I will treat
him with a fair deal of
patience, as anyone with
a mental health condition
should be treated.
of headphones. There are
a lot of production and
vocal nuances which, if
missed, may cause the
into subdued rapping
which is sweet until an
abrasive beat switch
up kind of ruins things.
Another experimental
moment on the project that
does not pay off is ‘All
Mine’. Jeremih’s Young
Thug impression on the
chorus is jarring and the
sparse drums accentuating
Kanye’s confession of all
the “basic” girls he craves
only comes off as tacky.
‘Yikes’ sounds like
the sequel to ‘FML’
from The Life of Pablo,
though a sonically and
lyrically lesser version.
‘Wouldn’t Leave’ and
‘Violent Crimes’ are odes
to his wife and daughter
respectively. The former
is a soft admission of the
strain his recent actions
put on his marriage and
Kim’s tender loyalty. The
latter, the last track on the
album, is a pretty simple
but endearing insight
into Kanye’s anxiety
surrounding the attention
his daughter is bound to
get when she grows up.
“Don’t you grow up in a
hurry” 070 Shake croons
on the chorus. This comes
straight after the singer’s
fireworks-display of a
performance on ‘Ghost
Town’ – certainly the
highlight of the album.
The theme of mental dys-
functionality and love in
spite of that really comes
to a head in a beautiful
fusion of instruments and
synths matching herself,
Kanye, Kid Cudi and
John Legend’s emotional
delivery. Another high-
light is ‘No Mistakes’,
a true Late Registration
throwback containing
the best Ye verse on the
album. Indeed, Kanye,
“a shaky-ass year” is an
understatement.
Natalie Prass returns bigger, bolder, and hella funkier
A
long with a
worsening of
the environ-
mental crisis,
the increasing shameless-
ness of neo-Nazis, and
a potentially precipitous
plunge into nuclear ar-
mageddon, we can blame
Donald Trump for another
problem: the long wait for
The Future and the Past,
the follow up to Virginian
songwriter and Matthew
E. White collaborator
Natalie Prass’ self-titled
debut. Prass had the album
ready to go at the end
of 2016, but scrapped it
following the presidential
election, breaking with
the Spacebomb label and
producing a record that
feels much more urgent
and necessary.
From the opener ‘Oh
My’, it is clear The Future
and the Past is going to
be a different kettle of fish
to Natalie Prass. While
her first LP was deep
within the Spacebomb
ethos – a collection of
timeless songs, evocative
of Southern soul, with a
sprinkling of Broadway
and classic Americana –
The Future and the Past is
comprised of a much more
modern sound: the beats
are faster, the riffs funkier,
and the majority of tracks
Janet Jackson’s ‘What
Has He Done For You
Lately’, while slow burner
cascading keyboards,
checking out with a jazzy
piano solo.
The ballad ‘Lost’,
which comes halfway
through the record, is
evocative of her earlier
work – and displays
Prass’ warm, powerful
vocals, which she usually
reserves behind a speak-
sing style – but still
retains a spikiness. While
Natalie Prass was full of
rounded sounds – soaring
violins and glowing
brass – The Future and
the Past is indebted to
‘70s funk, lounge jazz,
and neo-soul. ‘Far From
You’, a tribute to Karen
Carpenter, is Prass at her
most Spacebomb-esque,
but is followed by ‘Ain’t
Nobody’, whose high-hat
beat and bleep-bloop
baseline mark a turning
point in Prass’ career.
Lyrically, the record
is markedly different.
On ‘Oh My’, she takes
shots at modern politics,
asking “what is lying to
a cheat?” while ‘Hot for
the Mountain’ centres
around the refrain of ‘we
can take you all’. ‘Shop
Go Down’ and ‘Nothing
to Say’ both speak of
brewing storm – whether
that’s one of resistance or
trouble it’s hard to gauge.
‘Sisters’ may take the
idea of protest lyrics a bit
literally – ”come on nasty
women / so all the bad
girls here’ let’s make that
clear” – but then again,
so did ‘Blowing in the
Wind’, so there are few
complaints.
The Future and the
Past is a bold, assured
follow-up to Prass’
long-delayed debut. She
has already proved herself
to be a confident musical
magpie, as happy with an
old-school ballad as with
a bit of funk. It’s exciting
to see where she might go
from here.
