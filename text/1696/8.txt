“We have updated our privacy policy” – a closer look
into GDPR

R e g u l a t i o n ,
o t h e r w i s e
known as GDPR, is a
set of new regulations
that has the potential to
fundamentally flip the
– increasingly strained –
relationship between the
massive technology com-
panies that gather data and
the users from whom they
gather it.
The issue of privacy in
the tech world has been
ballooning at a formidable
rate, notably with the
widespread coverage
of the investigation
into Facebook’s data
privacy practices after
the infamous Cambridge
Analytica scandal earlier
this year.
The GDPR, which
became enforceable from
25th
May 2018, is a set
of regulations passed by
the European Union in
2016, setting stricter rules
policing how companies
manage and share the
personal data of users. In
theory, the GDPR only
applies the data of EU
citizens. However, the
global nature of internet
services means nearly
every online service is
affected, and the reg-
ulation has resulted in
significant changes for
users all over the world
as companies globally
scramble to adapt.
Much of the GDPR
builds upon rules set
by earlier EU privacy
measures such as the Data
Protection Directive and
Privacy Shield, but there
are some crucial aspects
of the GDPR that warrant
a closer look.
Firstly, the GDPR sets a
higher bar for companies
to obtain personal data
than we’ve ever seen on
the internet before. For
any instance where a
company collects personal
data on an EU citizen,
it will by default need
explicit and informed
consent from that person.
The GDPR also enforces
that users have “the right
to be forgotten”. In other
words, users need to be
given a way to revoke that
same consent.
Users should also be
able to request all the data
a company has on them
as a way to verify that
consent. This concept has
been present in previous
iterations of privacy reg-
ulations, but the GDPR
ensures companies give
individuals access to the
information that organi-
sations hold about them
free of charge. Prior to the
GDPR, there was a £10
fee for a Subject Access
Request, which business-
es and public bodies can
charge in order to release
any personal information.
However, the GDPR
means this fee will be
scrapped, and requests for
personal information can
be made free-of-charge
and must be released
within one month.
These changes make
the GDPR a significant
improvement on existing
requirements, and it ex-
plicitly extends to compa-
nies based outside the EU.
The tech industry
has, especially in recent
years, become used to
(and highly dependent
on) collecting and sharing
data with little to no
restriction. Furthermore,
that freedom has been the
primary business model
of several companies.
The GDPR gives users
more control over their
data, and also pushes for
innovation in the way
that online advertising is
currently targeted.
For companies that
have for far too long
operated under the rather
irresponsible principle of
‘extract as much data as
possible and figure it out
later,’ reorganising under
GDPR will be a pain. Part
of the problem is how
companies’ data solutions
are set up, and a portion of
it is that ‘personal infor-
mation’ is a wishy-washy
category. Names, email
address, phone numbers,
location data – those are
the obvious ones. But then
there’s more ambiguous
data, like ‘an oblique ref-
erence, like the tall bald
guy who lives on East 18th
Street.’ Such data would
be hard to organise, and
that makes GDPR-en-
forced Subject Access
Requests particularly
difficult to handle.
To be fair, GDPR as
a whole is a bit more
complicated than what
I’ve illustrated above.
Alison Cool, a professor
of anthropology and
information science at the
University of Colorado,
Boulder,writesinTheNew
York Times that the law is
“staggeringly complex”
and practically incom-
prehensible to the people
who are trying to comply
with it. Several scientists
and data managers she
spoke to “doubted that
absolute compliance was
even possible.”
At the end of the day,
the effectiveness of
GDPR will only be seen
as time passes and will
depend quite heavily on
how strictly it is enforced.
But users like you and
me can take steps to be
more aware of the rights
that we have over the data
that we so readily hand
over to companies. For
starters, go take a look
at your Instagram app’s
settings page. It looks
vastly different to how it
a few months ago – and
that’s partly attributed to
the GDPR.
I’ve received more than 17 emails from the services with that exact subject. And I’m not the only one who’s inbox
has been flooded – here’s why.
