The age of Oneohtrix Point Never has finally touched
down
Age Of is a brilliant development for Oneohtrix Point Never, which sees producer Daniel Lopatin taking on more
collaborators, and deconstructing popular music’s toolkit.
I
n their 1997 book
The Fourth Turning,
historians and
authors William
Strauss and Neil Howe
put forward their theory
that all of human history
could be tracked as an
infinite cycle of four ages,
as regular and predictable
as clockwork. An ‘awak-
ening’ would be followed
by an ‘unravelling’, then
a ‘crisis’, which would
resolve with a ‘high’,
before the whole thing
starts over again. Between
each of these ages, a
specific event would
shift humanity into a new
chronological epoch, like
some kind of mechanical
automaton. It’s the kind
of intellectual theory that
gives rise to a faint sense
of satisfaction: to identify
our specific point within
the history of the human
race, and define it as one in
a series of events, is to fix
us within time. It prevents
us from feeling lost, adrift
in a universe without any
kind of meaning.
It is also, as Daniel
Lopatin – who has been
working for the past
decade under the moniker
Oneohtrix Point Never,
producing gradually more
elaborate experimental
constructions – is at pains
to point out, completely
meaningless. As part of
the ephemera surrounding
his latest release, Age Of,
Loptain has created his
own system of chronolo-
gy, loosely based on the
progression of human
history from agrarian
arcadia, to capitalist
economy, to post-indus-
trial wasteland: the Ade
og Ecco, Age of Harvest,
Age of Excess, and Age
of Bondage. It’s a vague
system, one that has the
advantage of being able
to fit any situation, like
the historical version of
a pseudoscience. It is this
subversion that Loptain
delights in. “It is really the
most satisfying thing you
can do,” he told the New
York Times, “put a little
scratch in something…
that has the arrogance of
knowing what it is.”
“Oneohtrix
Point Never
has always
existed at the
margins of pop
music”
With Age Of, he’s not
letting us stay in one
place long enough to even
attempt to discover what
things are: at every turn,
Lopatin will upend our
expectations, subverting
what we have come to
expect in a regular form
of music. On ‘Babylon’,
for example, pipes whistle
and flutter, joined by
Loptain’s own vocod-
er-ed voice, anchored
to the baseline from the
Twin Peaks theme. It is,
perhaps, the closest he has
come to a straightforward
pop song, until it suddenly
cuts out, plunging us into
acoustic darkness, as if
something had blown
a fuse in the recording
studio.
In ‘Toys 2’, Lopatin
offers up a proof of
concept for a potential
soundtrack to a Pixar film.
The track starts off with
some straightforward
panpipes and whistling,
building in a crescendo
that wouldn’t sound out
of place in a Disney film,
over a scuttling beat of
pops and clicks. But then
the notes pile up, building
to a cacophony of black
MIDI-esque horror. The
fact the track was named,
not in reference to the
much-loved Toy Story,
but rather after Toys, the
1992 Robin Williams
nightmare-fuel, points to
its sensibility.
Oneohtrix Point Never
is always a project that
has existed at the margins
of pop music, scuttling
around its edge like a
dark crustacean. Loptain
clips and borrows from
the language of modern
pop – glassy synths,
deep baselines – while
retaining the syntax of
experimental music,
throwing in references to
cyberpunk, postmodern
philosophy, and 1990s
internet culture. The result
is a sound existing within
a liminal space, unan-
chored. ‘The Station’, a
track originally intended
for Usher, demonstrates
this tendency, juxtaposing
its autotuned vocals with
an underlying static, as if
warning us of a coming
storm within the void.
The result is a sound
that, although deeply
entrenched within a mesh
of referents, remains un-
tethered from reality.
Lopatin has also taken
on more pop sensibilities
in terms of the production
of this album, which is his
most collaborative yet.
After producing tracks for
ANOHNI’s album Hope-
lessness back in 2016, she
returns the favour, lending
her haunting vocals to a
number of pieces. Noise
artist Prurient is also
enlisted, echoing back
Loptain’s words, the
screaming overlaid in a
wailing electroshock of
noise. James Blake came
on board to help with the
final mixing of the work.
Luckily all these collab-
orators manage to fit into
Lopatin’s sonic universe.
Cinematic is a word
often used to describe
music like Oneohtrix
Point Never’s, which
makes use of expanse and
aural imagery. But the
term is a lazy one, which
belies what Loptain is
really trying to do: he is
not creating a film, but
an entire world. From the
plinking harpsichord on
opening ‘Age of’, which
quickly disintegrates
into the sonic equivalent
of a retro-futuristic city
builder game played
through a busted VHS
machine, through to the
cover art – a work by Jim
Shaw work entitled ‘The
Great Whatsit’, in which
three women, half-Lo-
gan’s Run, half choose
your own adventure
novel, gaze admiringly up
above a glowing macbook
– with this album Lopatin
is free-associating within
a structure of controlled
complexity.
Societies tending
towards decay. The
philosophical problem of
nuclear waste disposal.
Theories of a post-sin-
gularity world. These
are all ingredients added
together in a blender by
Loptain, resulting in a
musical collage that defies
description. Age Of is an
album that makes use of
a well-known toolbox
in totally unexpected
ways. Difficult? Perhaps.
Exceptional? Without a
doubt.

AGE OF
King Push reigns supreme on DAYTONA
P
usha T is one of
the few prominent
rappers from the
first decade of
the 2000s to side-step any
waning in his relevance
since then. He’s achieved
what a Lupe Fiasco or
a 50 Cent were not able
to by inhabiting a space
somewhere in between
– he raps about a street
lifestyle with a heavily
lyrical delivery that is
often cryptic and full of
references. Since the end
of his Clipse/Re-Up Gang
era, Pusha’s solo career
has only grown more suc-
cessful, having been made
president of Kanye’s
G.O.O.D Music in 2015
and releasing a few decent
mixtapes and two great
albums since 2011. His
last album, King Push –
Darkest Before Dawn:
The Prelude, was his best
to date, featuring gritty,
dark beats and typical
witty lyricism. That brings
us here, to the album
that was supposed to be
King Push, now renamed
DAYTONA, with similarly
unexpected cover art of
Whitney Houston’s drug
filled bathroom, selected
by Kanye two days before
its release. In fact, this
is perhaps Push’s most
Kanye-influenced album
with the alarmingly short
album length and the
production from start to
finish being the work of
Ye himself.
DAYTONA starts with
the incredible ‘If You
Know You Know’. The
song’s production is
infectiously chopped and
layered with a mind of
its own, distorted vocal
samples weaving in
and out at just the right
moments. Another neat
touch I should point out
in the production: the
instrumental on each song
of this project flows into
the next seamlessly. Push
packs his verses on this
first track with references
and imagery that only a
“trapper turned rapper”
such as himself would
fully appreciate, with
lines such as “I predict
snow, Al Roker / I only
ever looked up to Sosa
/ You all get a bird, this
nigga Oprah”. The pro-
duction on the next track,
‘The Games We Play’,
becomes simpler but just
as effective. Powerful
horns come crushing
down periodically with
loose guitar plucks and
drum claps filling the gaps
between, while Push lays
down braggadocious bars
with no interruptions. “I
am your Ghost and your
Rae / This is my Purple
Tape, save up for rainy
days” he claims, a particu-
larly clever line referring
to the Raekwon and
Ghostface album, Only
Built 4 Cuban Linx…,
which was nicknamed the
Purple Tape and included
the song ‘Rainy Dayz’.
The project then
simmers as it leads into
the track ‘Hard Piano’,
with the production doing
pretty much what the title
promises. A piano melody
loops itself, becoming
slightly boring by the end
of the track, especially
alongside Rick Ross’
forgettable verse. The
chorus is a pretty glam-
orous moment though,
with Tony Williams
singing about the drug
capital Santo Domingo.
The next track definitely
picks up, beginning with
a dramatic sample of
The Mighty Hannibal
speaking about addiction.
The beat then abruptly
cuts in; a minimalistic but
heavy thumping bass that
demands headbanging.
It’s grimy and dark and
perfectly matches Push’s
mean, pronounced flow.
The bass melts away
again for the chorus,
another emotive soul
sample, before coming
right back in for the
second verse. We then
flow into the emotional
centre-piece of the album
– ‘Santeria’. Push mourns
the tragic murder of his
road manager, De’Von
Pickett, with the produc-
tion perfectly matching
his bars. First, we get the
mature but cold side of his
pain matched by an eerie
electric guitar refrain.
The eeriness comes to a
head at the chorus as 070
Shake sings a ghostly
Spanish echo over synth
hums. Push comes back
in sounding more sombre,
with lines such as “Darken
my doorstep, they told me
the day’s gone”, before
the beat switches again
to aggressive, clattering
drums and Push becomes
more menacing, implying
that he will “draw blood”
as reparation.
A similarly ominous
sounding beat is main-
tained for ‘What Would
Meek Do?’, which sees
Ye and Push each spit
a verse on how they
respond to those “talking
shit”. Push’s verse is full
of materialistic bragging
and cites Meek Mill,
recently released from a
ridiculously harsh prison
sentence, as the devil
on his shoulder. Kanye
delivers a pretty impres-
sive verse also, complete
with a suggestion that the
MAGA hat he infamously
donned will make him
exempt from racial profil-
ing.
The last track on the
album is ‘Infrared’. The
beat is loose and echoey
with a looped sample that
works well. Pusha raps
without a hook on this
song, which is appropriate
because he has a lot to
say. A subliminal Pusha
T vs Drake, Birdman, and
Lil Wayne beef has been
present since 2011, though
as of this album the most
attention it had gotten was
on Drake’s ‘Two Birds,
One Stone’ where he
questioned Push’s street
credibility. On ‘Infrared’,
Pusha T responds to this
with very explicit shots
at all three Young Money
associates. The bars that
he directs at Drake mock
his reliance on a ghost
writer, arguably a brave
move since this was the
exact jab that began the
Drake-Meek beef of
2015, which Meek unde-
niably lost. Indeed, Drake
responded to ‘Infrared’
less than a day after the
release of this album
with ‘Duppy Freestyle’,
a pretty scathing attack
on not only Push, but
Kanye too. Drake made
one mistake though – he
mentioned Push’s fiance’s
name. It was this that Push
would cite as his trigger
after releasing the savage
‘The Story of Adidon’as a
response. Within the one-
verse track, Push pulls all
of Drake’s skeletons out
the closet – his absent,
dowdy father; the child
that he has been keeping a
secret and from whose life
Drake himself has been
absent; the lack of time
left for Drake’s terminally
ill producer, arguably
the contributing factor to
Drake’s popularity. The
only thing Drake has
offered since this public
crucifixion is a statement
attempting to explain the
song’s shocking cover
art – a genuine photo of
Drake in black face. If
you ask me, when you’re
replying to a diss track
with a press release, you
have officially lost the
beef. Rest in peace Drake,
while the internet rekin-
dles its pre-2015 love
affair of memeing you.
In all honesty though,
the real losers of this rap
beef are anyone sleeping
on this excellent album.
DAYTONA is proof that
Pusha T and Kanye are
still the only ones who
know how to make what
they make: lyrical, luxury
drug raps and hard,
bumping beats that hit you
right in the chest. Put the
two together and clearly,
you get a masterpiece.
DAYTONA // GOOD
