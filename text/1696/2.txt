Pay deductions from strikes continue, as Imperial
refuses to refund tuition fees to students
has not been ring-fenced
to ensure that it can only
be used for the benefit of
students.”
The strikes, which took
place over 14 working
days, saw numerous
classes cancelled across
the country. UCU,
which called the strike,
did so in response to
proposed changes to the
USS pension fund put
forward by Universities
UK (UUK). UCU said
the changes would see
members of the scheme
losingoutonupto£10,000
each year in pension pay.
Joint Expert Panel de-
cided
A further 14 days of
industrial action were
called off at the end of
April, as UCU members
voted to accept a proposal
by UUK. The proposal
involved establishing a
Joint Expert Panel (JEP)
to report on valuation
of the current pension
scheme, which will stay
in place until at least April
2019.
Appointments to the
JEP, which will also
“agree key principles to
underpin the future joint
approach of UUK and
UCU to the valuation
of the USS fund,” were
announced last month.
UCU and UUK have
each nominated three JEP
appointments with strong
backgrounds in actuarial
science and public policy.
UCU has selected
Professor Saul Jacka
(University of Warwick),
Professor Deborah
Mabbett (Birkbeck Uni-
versity) and Associate
Professor Catherine
Donnelly (Heriot-Watt).
UUK has selected Ronnie
Bowie (Hymans Robert-
son consultancy), Sally
Bridgeland (non-execu-
tive director at the Local
Pensions Partnership, and
trustee of Lloyds Bank
pension scheme), and
Chris Curry (Director of
the Pensions Policy Insti-
tute). Joanne Segars OBE,
chair of LGPS Central,
which pools nine local au-
thority pension funds, will
chair the JEP. It is due to
report in September 2018.
A spokesperson for
UCU told Felix: “The
work of the JEP will
be closely watched by
members of UCU and it is
hoped that a satisfactory
agreement can be reached
to avert the necessity of
UCU taking further strike
action over our pensions.”
surplus to buildings rather
than to staff.”
A spokesperson for
the College told Felix the
discussions have “taken
into account feedback
from staff raised as part
of the Pay and Benefits
Review.”
“A number of follow
up actions from the Pay
and Benefits Review are
already underway. Staff
raised concerns about the
benchmark data used to
inform pay decisions, and
the Provost has instigated
a Benchmarking Working
Group that will be led by
the Dean of the Faculty
of Engineering, Profes-
sor Nigel Brandon, and
include representatives
from across the College.
The working group will
make an interim report in
September.”
The College will meet
the JTUs on 15th
June to
present the College’s pay
offer. Information about
the offer should be availa-
ble shortly afterwards.
Tuition Fee Refunds
The debate over
tuition fee refunds is still
ongoing. A petition that
circulated at the end of
last term saw over 3,000
students asking for a
refund in tuition fees in
light of missed teaching.
The petition was sent
to senior management,
but some students felt the
response was insufficient.
Alex Chippy Compton,
President of Imperial
College Union, and Luke
McCrone, President of
the Graduate Students’
Union, at the time said
the response from senior
management was “un-
satisfactory, and failed to
address many students’
concerns”.
A class action bid,
launched by law firm
Asserson, has seen a
number of students join to
force universities to com-
pensate them for teaching
time lost. Asserson esti-
mates fair compensation
for teaching time lost
would be several hundred
pounds per student. The
case has attracted over
5,000 students, from a
range of universities.
saying: “We haven’t heard
of a single university
offering to pay anybody
compensation for the lost
teaching time.”
He went on to say:
“Universities simply
will not pay until they’re
forced to pay, and the only
effective way to force
them to pay is to take
them to court. To do so
individually doesn’t make
sense, because it’s too
much risk and work for
one person, but to do it as
a group is doable.”
A College repre-
sentative told Felix it
“currently has no plans to
refund students”, saying:
“Fees cover all aspects
of a student’s time at
Imperial, and are based
on the delivery of overall
outcomes, rather than
being payments for spe-
cific contact hours.” This
argument was echoed
by several other Russell
Group universities, which
said they had no plans to
offer refunds to students.
Mr Goldwater told
Felix that, while tuition
fees do go toward several
services, “the question is
working out percentages.
I don’t think anyone
would say the percentage
of fees that go on teaching
time is zero…if you look
at the budgets universities
have, salaries of teaching
staff are often the single
biggest item by a long
way. It’s not unreasonable
to suggest that more than
50% of the tuition fee
relates to face-to-face
teaching.”
Earlier this week,
results of the 2018 Student
Academic Experience
Survey were released,
highlighting a desire from
students for better value
for money in their degree
courses. Fewer than 40%
of students thought they
were getting value for
money from their univer-
sity, with tuition fees and
teaching quality leading
causes of dissatisfaction.
Students also highlighted
a desire for more contact
hours, possibly a result of
high fees students current-
ly pay.

and April”
The first meeting of the
JEP took place at the end
of last month. A report
on the meeting stated the
Panel agreed to seek sub-
missions from stakehold-
ers on the 2017 valuation
of the USS, particularly
looking at ‘alternative
valuation models and
assumptions to those used
by USS.”
The developments on
the pension discussions
come as the College
begins the annual process
of exploring pay options
for staff. Last month,
members of UCU, Unite,
and Unison presented a
pay claim to the College

2005. The Joint Trade
Unions (JTU) wrote:

Where is the money going?
S
o, we’re nearly
at the end. This
week marks the
penultimate edito-
rial – this time next week,
you’ll be reading the last
paper of this academic
year, which will also be
the last time you’ve got
to listen to my weird
stream-of-consciousness
ramblings.
But in some ways, this
week is the last ‘real’ ed-
itorial, since I know next
week it’s just going to
be me gushing over how
amazing all our contrib-
utors have been over the
past year. This means this
week is the last chance I
have to speak my mind,
and do one last bit of
tubthumping before I go.
SoI’vedecidedtoreturn
to the topic of the strikes.
Remember those? Back
when the weather was
exceptionally bitter, and
many of us walked past
our friends and colleagues
picketing out in the snow
to get (a) to class, (b) a
copy of Felix, or (c) an
SCR muffin (choose your
poison). If you remember,
the academic and support
staff were taking action
about changes to their
pensions, which would
have made them worse off
in the long-run; they were
joined by students, who
– although not directly
affected – were aware of
the impact this could have
on their future studies or
careers.
While the strike might
be over – for the time
being – the effects are still
being felt. And one place
they are being particularly
felt is in the pay packets
of the staff who joined the
strike. Universities across
the UK withheld pay for
each day their staff went
on strike, and docked
pay for days where staff
refused to cover classes
or reschedule teaching.
This is money that is still
being withheld by the
universities, with monthly
incomes being reduced
for staff.
A Felix investigation
found already Russell
Group universities had
withheld £8 million from
staff, with further deduc-
tions planned pushing it
past the £10 million mark.
We don’t know how much
is being withheld across
the UK, but based on
the data we got from the
Russell Group, it is highly
likely to be in the tens
of millions, potentially
approaching the £100
million mark. This high-
lights the very real risk
our staff took to join in
the strike – particularly in
a city like London, where
the rise in cost of living
has outpaced increases in
Imperial salaries.
One use of the money,
which none of the uni-
versities we contacted
mentioned, was giving
it back to students, who
have paid for their uni-
versity education, and had
been missing out (in some
cases quite significantly).
As far as I am aware, no
university in the UK has
considered paying back
tuition fees to students;
and they’re not going to,
unless the current legal
battles that are ongoing
succeed. The response
from senior management
at Imperial – that we pay
for ‘an overall outcome’
and nothing else – is
short-sighted, offensive,
and damaging to the very
idea of the university as
an institution. We don’t
come here to just get a 2:1
and fuck off. Or, at least,
we shouldn’t. We come
here to have a true univer-
sity experience. To meet
friends who we will keep
in touch with for the rest
of our lives. To learn from
inspiring mentors. To
forge links. To lose sight
of this is to cease to be
an educational institution,
and become a factory.
