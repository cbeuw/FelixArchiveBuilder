Grumpy Bastard on Love Island: a sexually-
charged narcissist’s paradise
This week, to celebrate nearing the end of exams, Grumpy Bastard has taken a swing at the
nation’s favourite TV show: Love Island.

Comment Writer
T
hank Jean-
Claude Juncker,
the exam season
is nearly over. To
those of you who have fin-
ished exams, may I extend
my congratulations; and
to those that have not,
I shall laugh pityingly
whilst sipping a scotch.
May your efforts extend
to barely attaining a pass
this year.
I think that there are
several signs indicating
when British summer
officially begins: the end
of the nice weather and
the sudden onslaught of
overcast skies; the sight
of the first gammon wan-
dering around with his
shirt off and his sunburnt
tits out for all to see; and,
more recently, the start of
the sexually-charged nar-
cissist’s paradise that is
Love Island. As it features
in a Grumpy Bastard, you
can of course assume that
I fucking despise it.
As a show, it has one
basic premise: the execu-
tives at ITV, clearly driven
to distraction by the de-
clining viewership of Big
Brother, came up with the
bright idea to do the same
programme, but with a
twist. Why not make sure
that all the people are
quite attractive, almost
universally the same
shade of orange, and also
have about as much grey
matter between them as
your average cockroach?
All the characters
have so little depth, if
the participants were a
swimming pool, they
wouldn’t even be able to
drown a paralysed quad-
riplegic. Other than the
compelling cast, the show
has a magnificent way of
manufacturing tension,
whereby if an individual
is single by the end of the
week, they will be sent off
the island.
In order to prevent all
of the cast becoming com-
fortable with each other,
the producers drip feed
new meat onto the show
and create conflict through
the use of challenges and
an ever imbalanced male
to female ratio. Quite
frankly, that’s about as
much of an explanation
as I’m willing to give. I
could explain some of the
nuance, but there just isn’t
any. It is probably the most
blatant sex-sells success
that anyone, except from
maybe Playboy, has ever
pulled off.
The whole concept
of Love Island has now
convinced me that when
they have run out of at-
tractive people to feature
– and in Britain that will
be fairly soon – the next
logical step that ITV
will take is to run real
gladiatorial fights, where
the victor is rewarded by
being able to sleep with
the man/woman they
choose, and the loser has
to desperately claw at
their intestines as they pile
up on the ground. It would
probably be as compelling
as Love Island and I’m
sure people would make
the same excuses as to
why they watch it, about it
being ironic. Don’t lie to
yourself. You need these
people to watch and laugh
at as they pathetically
imitate romance in real
life, all whilst wearing no
clothes, because it makes
you feel superior at the
same time as giving you a
raging erection.
“Love Island is
nothing more
than a colossal
turd in the
form of a light
entertainment
programme”
Thanks to people like
you, Western Civilization
is doomed.
Are you sentient?
Do you have opinions?
Do you want to share
them in Felix?!

Cultural appropriation should not be
trivialised
BME Officer Chimdi Igwe responds to last week’s article and thinks people need to appreciate
what cultural appropriation really means.
COMMENT
Chimdi Igwe
BME Officer
O
ver the past nine
or so months
(and, if I’m
honest, much
earlier than that), I’ve
often found myself being
thrust into conversations
around topics of race, eth-
nicity, and identity. More
than once, I’ve been asked
all manner of questions or
for my take on a number
of issues, many of which
I haven’t really cared for.
But nothing gets under
my skin quite like the
mention of ‘cultural
appropriation’ – so much
so that I have to suppress
the urge to roll my eyes
dramatically each time it’s
uttered.
Nevertheless, I couldn’t
help but cringe when
reading a piece published
in the Comment section
of Felix last week. The
article was centred around
the news story that broke
of a young woman who
was met with criticism
online for wearing a tra-
ditional classical Chinese
dress to her high school
prom.
Though the article’s
tone was meant to be
satirical at best (which is
giving it a lot), I felt un-
necessarily vexed by the
lacklustre approach to dis-
cussing the idea of cultural
appropriation. Despite
my general discomfort
with broaching this topic
when often asked about
it, I decided it would be
amiss to sweep this under
the table without making a
rebuttal of sorts.
With academic soci-
ological concepts, the
general trend has been
that their definitions
become diluted as they
move from the realm of
academia to the mass
public (you could say as
they get ‘appropriated’),
taking on meanings which
poorly reflect their defini-
tions. One good example
is the tendency to misuse
the word ‘racism’ in sit-
uations where, going by
its original definition, it
does not necessary apply
(anyone who went to a
multicultural secondary
school will likely have
witnessed this).
Like everything to
do with liberation work,
cultural appropriation is
about power dynamics
on the societal level (I’ve
put this in bold because if
you take nothing else from
this article, understand
this). When academics
talk about cultural appro-
priation, they are looking
at how a society can
embrace a culture whilst
rejecting its source: the
people.
Of course, culture is
fluid and flows across the
world – “no man is an
island”,afterall.Welivein
a European country whose
national dish is apparently
chicken tikka masala. But
false equivalencies exist,
and the article was riddled
with them in all forms. I
will try to break down the
more pertinent ones.
Firstly, wearing
Western clothing in
a Western country is
not appropriation, it is
assimilation. Neither is
undertaking a Western
education (which itself
greatly benefitted from
Islamic scholars in areas
such as mathematics).
My foremothers walked
around their communities
completely bare-chested
with the utmost confi-
dence and with no shame
(not so much anymore).
Imagine the front pages
of the tabloids if my
grandmother did this now.
Countless headlines have
been published in which
people have complained
about Islamic faith schools
– that they don’t embrace
‘Western education’ and
‘British values’ (neither
are quite true).
Secondly, there is
such a thing as cultural
exchange. In this case,
there is a mutual benefit to
both cultures in question.
Though I know very little
about Malaysian culture,
I do come from a country
of over 200 ethnic groups;
fashion, music and slang
flow around.
juvenile, and that we had
“actual important things”
to focus on. In any area
of liberation, dismissive
apathy can be more dan-
gerous that outright op-
pression. As an Imperial
student who has taken
the time out of their day
to write an article about
something for which they
don’t care, I’m sure the
writer is capable of caring
about more than one issue
at a time.

“Wearing
Western
clothing in

not
appropriation”
Thirdly, and most im-
portantly, we can’t ignore
colonisation. Much of the
conversation about appro-
priation tends to focus on
the United States, often
around Native and/or
black American culture
– groups of people who
historically have been op-
pressed and suppressed in
society. When a group of
people have been forced
to isolate their culture
from the mainstream for
whatever reason, can they
truly be blamed for feeling
angry when you try to
incorporate their culture
into your own whilst
ignoring their grievances?
What really bothered
me about the article
was the dismissive way
the writer approached
appropriation, suggesting
that talking about appro-
priation was somehow
I’d just like to clarify
at this point that I per-
sonally didn’t care much
for the debates online
as to whether or not that
young woman appropri-
ated Chinese culture. The
speed at which people
label something as ‘ap-
propriative’ is concerning,
and many times the term
is incorrectly used. That’s
not an excuse to throw the
baby out with the bathwa-
ter.
The line between
appreciation and appro-
priation is thin, and it’s
a real headache trying to
map it. But to pretend that
the latter is fiction is just
being obtuse. And that’s
never a good look.
