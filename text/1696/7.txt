Charles Dickens – was he the original science
communicator?
The Victorian author is known for his dense novels, exploring the intricacies of a rapidly-changing society, but he
was also a keen science enthusiast, as a new exhibition shows.

W
hen you
hear of
C h a r l e s
D i c k e n s ,
you most likely instantly
think of classic works
of literature, such as
A Christmas Carol,
Oliver Twist, or Great
Expectations. However,
seldom does one hear he
was a man of science – let
alone an early science
communicator! Indeed,
George Henry Lewes, a
prominent writer, critic,
and amateur physiologist
of the Victorian era
declared Dickens was
“completely outside phi-
losophy, science, and the
higher literatures” follow-
ing a look at his library.
Unbeknownst to many
us, however, Dickens
was indeed an individual
heavily influenced by
science, with much of
his work being inspired
by a variety of scientific
aspects, from the human
body to the Earth itself.
Dickens was at the
centre of Victorian
society, with a devoted
audience taking his word
as gospel, from his novels
to the magazines he pub-
lished and edited. Con-
sequently, his fame put
him in touch with several
notable scientists of his
day and age including
Charles Darwin, chemist
Jane Marcet, botanist Jane
Loudon, and Michael
Faraday, to name a few.
Furthermore, his work
was admired by the likes
of Florence Nightingale,
who would even prescribe
his novels as treatment to
the soldiers she nursed.
Dickens’ lifetime saw
a number of key scientific
breakthroughs, which
lay the foundations for
modern science, such as
the acceptance of the age
of the earth, the theory of
evolution, and the second
law of thermodynamics.
Dickens himself felt so
deeply about these issues
that he campaigned for
various scientific theories,
as well as publicly crit-
icising other aspects of
science. Unfortunately,
little is spoken today
about how Dickens has
helped shape scientific
understanding, and how
he tried to solve social
problems through inspir-
ing his audience with his
books. Unbeknownst to
us, Charles Dickens is
indeed a man of science,
and should be recognised
for his contributions to the
modern era.
“Dickens is a
man of science,
and should
be recognised
for his
contributions
to the time” “Dickens
campaigned
for a science
everyone
could do or be
involved in”
Last month, the Charles
Dickens Museum opened
a new exhibition to try
and address this lack of
understanding – Charles
Dickens: Man of Science
looks at his work to try
and show he was a key
science communicator of
the age. Speaking to Felix,
Guest Curator Dr Adelene
Buckland, senior lecturer
in nineteenth-century lit-
erature at King’s College
London, said that they
believe this was the first
exhibition of its kind to
focus on Dicken’s interest
in science. Dr Buckland
said: “Dickens was a
famous writer, but his
powers of observation and
his connections as one of
the most famous men in
Britain at the time meant
that he was also a leading
communicator of science.
He communicated science
through his journals and
magazines, and cam-
paigned on it, on behalf of
lots of his friends.”
Dr Buckland was also
clear about the importance
of Dickens’role in shaping
public understanding of
science: “Dickens is a
would associate with
science, as he did not have
a background in science
or scientific training, and
was mainly associated
with the arts. He cam-
paigned for a science that
everyone could do, or be
involved in and partici-
pate in – a science that is
exciting and enlivening.
He was a pioneer of that
idea that science matters
most when it reaches
more people!”
Here at Imperial, a lot
of great research is going
on. However, much of
the time it is confined
to scientific journals. If
you want your research
to reach the masses, then
take inspiration from
Dickens: look for science
communication events,
team up with someone
who has an interest in
the arts, or try something
unusual to grab people’s
attention!

Museum (closest tube:

ne of the more

i n v a s i v e
species, now
found across the world
thanks to mankind, is the
domestic cat! Whether
these moggies are pets
left to roam free, or have
established themselves
as feral population, both
cause unimaginable
damage to various spe-
cies around the globe.
Domestic cats have no
native range, and they
are listed among the 100
worst non-native inva-
sive species in the world,
by the International
Union for Conservation
of Nature (IUCN). In
2013, a study conducted
in the US estimated that
domestic cats, both owned
and feral, killed between
1.3–4.0 billion birds and
6.3–22.3 billion mammals
each year. As well as the
direct effects of hunting,
cats can act as vectors
for multiple diseases,
including those that can
be spread to humans such
as rabies.
The domestic cat is, of
course, a beloved pet, but
most people seem to be
oblivious to the ecological
damage their cat has the
potential to inflict. These
effects are more notably
seen on islands, with
statistics recorded by the
IUCN Red List indicating
that cats have caused or
been implemented in the
extinctions of 33 modern
birds, mammals, and
reptiles. Here in the UK,
the very rare and endemic
Scottish wild cat is at risk
of imminent extinction
due to hybridisation from
feral cats, and the trans-
mission of disease. There
have been isolated inci-
dents around the world
of single cats killing large
amounts of wildlife, such
as a case from Ohakune,
New Zealand where in a
week one cat killed a total
of 102 bats. This is based
purely on the number of
bats that were found dead;
we all know cats like to
play with their food, thus
the real number is likely
much higher.
All of this has sounded
pretty negative so far, but
I am not against owning
cats, nor do I hate them.
I think now is the time
to step up and to become
responsible for the actions
of our pets in order to
prevent further damage to
the ecosystems into which
we have transplanted
them.
The main reason they
are such a threat is that the
animals that they hunt are
not used to predators (es-
pecially on islands); and
so, cats can unfortunately
lead to their extinction. I
am sure if you own a cat,
it may have once bought
you unwanted gifts in
the past – in the form of
dead mice or birds. If you
want to help prevent local
wildlife in your neck of
the woods from declining,
try to keep your cats in
doors and neuter/spay
them. Cats are prolific
breeders, with feral pop-
ulations quickly growing
due to their young age
of sexual maturity and
the large numbers of
litter a cat can have
each year. So next time
Tigger is out playing in
the garden, just think of
the unseen damage that
your beloved pet may
actually be responsible
for.

Puppy science: Why they are so cute?
I
don’t know about all
of you reading this,
but I am crazy about
puppies! However,
have you ever wondered
why they look so incredi-
bly adorable, especially at
a young age?
According to a recent
collaborative study
between the US and the
Netherlands, puppies
have evolved to be cute
because their life depends
on it. Unlike their wolf
ancestors, the mothers
of these puppies usually
leave them when they are
six to eleven weeks old,
depending on the breed
and whether they live in
the wild or in captivity. It
means that puppies will
not receive support from
their parents following
this weaning period. This
lack of nursing can result
in a shortage of food,
and in some cases death.
Therefore, it would be
logical to deduce that
young dogs who are more
attractive during this
weaning period would be
loved by us humans and
therefore have a better
chance to be adopted,
increasing their chances
of survival.
More importantly, the
group suggests this ‘peak’
of adorability is around
the time of weaning,
because younger puppies
are actually dependent on
their parents; therefore,
being very attractive prior
to that age does not make
evolutionary sense.

attractive they were.
The three breeds shown
were Jack Russell Terrier,
Cane Corso, and White
Shepherd. Since Cane
Corso is a large breed,
often used as guard dogs,
it is not surprising that it
is perceived as compara-
tively less attractive. Nev-
ertheless, all puppies were
rated as most attractive
prior to ten weeks across
all three breeds. Addi-
tionally, the puppies were
reported as having a very
low attractiveness rating
around the one-week
mark. Consequently, this
supported their hypothesis
of puppies being per-
ceived as more adorable
to humans around the
weaning period.
To study the hu-
man-dog bond, the paper
suggested they could
screen videos instead of
still photos, in order to
study how the movement
of dogs affected our
perception of the puppies.
While the experiment is
overwhelmingly cute, we
can also learn some psy-
chological information,
since baby-like facial
traits in humans are also
perceived as more likable.
For example, if you have a
‘baby-face’, with a larger
forehead and a smaller
jaw, you are probably
perceived as more attrac-
tive. This phenomenon,
coined ‘Kindchenschema
effect’, is proposed to
ensure adults care for
their young’uns, so babies
survive.
So next time you see a
puppy, think how Mother
Nature is manipulating
us to love them, and then
go pet them! If you have
a baby face, be grateful as
you are perceived as more
attractive! If you do not
however, it is also fine as
you have already grown
up and your parents love
you anyway.
