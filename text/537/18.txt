ROWING — ALLOM CUP REGATTA
O n Saturday, the whole of the IC Boat Club
turned up at the U L Boathouse by Kew
Bridge, to compete in the Allom C u p Regatta
for U L colleges. In the evening, we returned
to Putney with nine pint tankards, nine half-
pint tankards and five men's medals together
with the Allom C u p for Men's Open Vllls and
the Roderick Hill C u p for Men's Senior C
Vllls. Even more encouraging, was that the
2nd VIII reached the final of the open event,
proving that IC has two Vllls faster than any
other London college. The results were:
ALLOM CUP (OPEN Vllls)
In the first heat, the Ist VIII raced against
arch-rivals and probably the only crew who
could beat IC, University College and
Hospital. Off the start, U C & H took an early
lead, but could not get away from IC. As the
race progressed, IC found their rhythm and
stroke by stroke, came back at them, and
eventually passed them and won by the
narrowest of margins: two feet. In another
heat, the 2nd VIII raced the King's College 1st
VIII. In this race, IC led from start to finish and
won by a comfortable one and a half lengths.
The final was between IC I, IC II and an VIII
from London Hospital. London took the early
lead but the 1st VIII soon found their rhythm
and were in front by the half way point. At
about this time, bad steering by the Hospital
cox caused a clash between them and the IC
2nd VIII (who were level with them). This
caused the umpire to stop the race and
London Hospital were disqualified. O u r row
then took place between the 1st VIII and the
2nd VIII and as expected the 1st VIII won by
about two and a half lengths.
RODERICK HILL CUP (SENIOR C
Vllls)
The 2nd V
I
1
1 were climbing up in this event
and discovered that no other college could
produce a second VIII to match them, and
came away comfortable winners.
NOVICE Vllls
This was the first opportunity for the
freshers to get a taste of racing. Their first
race was against Chelsea College and Guy's
Hospital. They got off to a bad start, due to
not hearing the starter correctly and were
never able to make up the deficit. They lost by
about one length to G u y s , w h o went o n to win
the final.
LADIES OPEN IVs
We entered two crews in this event. The A
crew beat London Hospital A and Q M C by
two lengths and easily won their heat, while
the B crew had an easy win over London
Hospital B. In the final, the two IC IVs were
joined by a crew entered as University
College and Hospital. It turned out that the
U C & H girls — a University of London crew
a n d were a c t u a l l y c o m p e t i n g in U L
equipment. The race was very close with U L
leading all the way but they were pushed very
hard by the IC A crew. The final result being a
win for U C & H by one length.
LADIES NOVICE IVs
In their first race, our girls novice crew had
a v e r y c o m f o r t a b l e w i n o v e r St
B a r t h o l o m e w ' s H o s p i t a l a n d C h e l s e a
College. In the final, they set of slowly against
Q M C , but in the latter stages of the race,
proved they had paced themselves perfectly
by rowing through and winning by a half a
length.
