or why say it in a few words when you can use two thousand
Once upon a time there was a young child
who wrote things like "the cat sat on the mat",
but society soon put a stop to that. After many
years of expensive education (probably
including an Oxbridge degree) he started to
write things like this:
"Mixed hereditament m e a n s a
hereditament which is not a dwelling house
but in the case of which the proportion of the
r a t e a b l e v a l u e of the h e r e d i t a m e n t
attributable to the part of the hereditament
used for the purposes of a private dwelling is
greater than the p r o p o r t i o n thereof
attributable to the part used for other
purposes."
This eye-glazing wonder of official prose is
from a rates bill issued by Fareham Borough
Council, and is presumably meant to be
understood by ordinary mortals such as rate-
payers. If you can't understand it you're in
good company. A Department of the
Environment form for applying for help with
loft insulation was so obscure thatthousands
of them had to be returned to the applicants
to be filled in properly. One local council even
issued a leaflet explaining how to fill in the
forms, but no-one could understand that
either.
But now, help is at hand in the shape of the
Plain English Campaign. Armed ony with a
shredding machine and infinite gall, they
descended on Parliament Square last
summer and managed to destroy large
numbers of illegible forms before being
moved on by the police. Their latest (and
-slightly more constructive) effort is a glossy
magazine Piam—^frgmk, dedicated to
ferreting out samples of gobbledygook and
exposing them to the piercing light of public
pillory. Tenancy agreements are, of course,
notorious. Here is a fine example of the
obscure English love of extremely long
sentences and dislike of those fiddly little
spots known as punctuation marks:
Sub-section (v): "To permit the landlord or
his agents with or without workmen and
others upon giving reasonable notice to enter

upon the premises at all reasonable times
during the daytime for the purposes of
repairing and painting the outside thereof or
carrying out and completing any structural or
other necessary or proper repairs to the
premises or of examining the state or
condition of the interior of the premises and
thereupon to permit the landlord or his
agents to give the tenant notice in writing...."
And that's only half of it.
The Campaign looks promising, for not
only is it a protest movement but it is actively
helping to rewrite official forms and leaflets,
consumer contracts and so on. The
organisers, Chrissy Maher and Martin Curtis,
have set up a 'Form Factory' to help local
authorities, government departments and
other official bodies to recast their
documents in plain English. A series of Plain
English Workshops are planned for next year,
to provide crash courses for people working
in public information. One person who would
benefit from such a course works at the
Department of Employment. He uses a
computer to write letters like this one, in
closely spaced capitals:
"To qualify for unemployment benefit you
must, in any one tax year, have paid as an
employed person a minimum amount of
Class 1 contributions. The minimum amount
required is that payable on earnings at the
level of the lower earnings limit for that year .
mulitiplied by 25. For persons who claim
benefit early in their insurance life this
condition may be modified to treat as paid in
one tax year all Class 1 contributions paid up
to the date on which benefit is claimed. If this
modification applies in your case it will have
to be considered before the decision on your
claim was made. A similar decision will apply
on any claims for later days on which the
grounds of this decision have not ceased to
exist."
This horror was brought to the attention of
the D O E , whose spokesman admitted, "We,..
have been aware for some time that letters
like this can be difficult to understand." On
the urging of the Campaign, the Department
is now working on an "improved and
simplified version".
What the Campaign needs now are
samples of obscure English from official
leaflets, forms, contracts and other such
documents to use as ammunition. If you can't
understand your form for rent rebates or your
car insurance policy, just send it to: Plain
Enqlish Campaign, 78 Wiltshire Street.
Salford, M7 OBD or if you're really keen,
there's a meeting at the Library Association, 7
Ridgmount Street, WC1 on Monday 10
December at 2:00pm.
Ilfdrd councillors couldn't understand a by-
law they were asked to pass, even though it
had been approved by their Highways
Committee and the Home Office. Part of it
read: "Provided that the by-law shall not
apply to any person riding a bicycle or
tricycle otherwise than to the obstruction or
danger of any person lawfully using such
footpath if the person riding has lawful
authority so to do." Asked for advice, the
Deputy Borough Solicitor admitted that he
didn't understand it either: "I was hoping that
no member would raise it and ask for its
meaning. The person who worded it left the
council a week ago."

ROCK'N'ROLL
For those of you who like heavy rock and roll
but did not go to the ICWA Disco last
Saturday, I can only say that you really
missed out on something. Cheap Trick, and
Quo just to start the evening and a live band,
MIXDIX, which one person compared to
Motorhead.
Better luck next time!
