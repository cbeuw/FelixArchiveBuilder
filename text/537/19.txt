at the Dominion Theatre, 4 Dec
Mike Harding first came into the limelight
with his single Rochdale Cowboy and since
then has delighted audiences up and down
the country with his own brand of Lancashire
humour and wit.
His show contained a highly entertaining
selection of experiences, past and present
including childhood, his life on the road, his
tour of America, life in a rock band in the
sixties and his first time in London.
A s well as showing his superb talent for
telling stories he also proved his worth as an
e x t r e m e l y v e r s a t i l e m u s i c i a n b y
accompanying his songs with acoustic
guitar, electic guitar, ukelele, banjo,
mandolin and harmonica.
During the three hour long show he did two
monologues: one as a drunken vicar with a
witty parody of the Noah's ark story and the
other as a Carruthers type Colonial
(complete with a set of flying ducks on the
wall).
Mike Harding showed another side to his
performance in singing a very sad but
beautiful song about the First World War
during the Christmas of 1914.
Mike Harding is and always will be the man
to see if you want a thoroughly enjoyable
night out with a Lancashire flavour.

THE GOLDEN LADY
(Director: Jose Larraz)
Julia Hemmingway (Christina World) is
hired by a business tycoon to help him obtain
an oil concession by eliminating the three
other bidders for the concession before the
ruler of the small oil-rich emirate arrives in
London.
With the help of three 'specialist' (and very
attractive) assistants, Dahilia (Suzanne
Danielle), Lucy (June Chadwick) and Carol
(Anika Paviel) and a computer, Julia begins a
preliminary investigation of all the bidders
and discovers that more is at stake than she
had supposed.
Most of the 'action' takes place between
Heathrow and the Hyde Park Hotel, despite
an over-complicated plot involving the
Greeks, the Israelis, an ex-Nazi and the
American and Soviet intelligence services.
During the investigation, we are taken to a
chic night club in London for the pleasure of
seeing Blonde on Blonde and Hot Gossip
perform, presumably to remind us of the
high-living and sophisticated world in which
the Golden Lady operates. However, this
disco interlude, together with a couple of dull
bedroom scenes, serves only to lengthen an
already uneventful story, in which even the
chase sequences lack any pace.
