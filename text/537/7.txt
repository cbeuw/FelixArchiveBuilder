RAMBLING THOUGHTS OF AN AG IMG FOOL
Hello A l l ! Well deep i n the heart ofthe
Union Store R o o m (barrel and gnome
emporium), things have been just
rolling along.-As I said last time, the
t e r m is waning e'en as I wax
ineloquently. I a m absolutely shattered
and I feel that the week or so of
C h r i s t m a s hols will come only too soon,
if not too late.
So you've survived R a g Week and
Environmental Week, both of which
have taken months o f planning by a few
people. Y o u probably turned up and
went away with neither a thought or a
care for the people like Roger and Rae
who spent dozens of hours for every
one hour of the event, but now I bet you
feel really guilty!
I would like to add to m y defence with
regard to a motion passed concerning
m y n o n a t t e n d a n c e at U n i v e r s i t y
Challenge in Manchester: I was elected
to represent the U n i o n at the Student
R e s i d e n c e C o m m i t t e e , w h o w e r e
discussing rent levels for next t e r m
(something I consider very important).
I stand by m y decision to attend that
meeting, so Y a h Boo Sucks!
G O O D N E W S
The Rector has decided to ignore the
recommendations of the aforemen-
tioned Residence Committee and will
be r e c o m m e n d i n g no change in the rent
levels for next term. Because of this
there will be no open meeting of H a l l
residents.
The last U G M passed a m o t i o n
forming a Cuts C a m p a i g n Committee.
The first of its events will be a
leafletting in the tube TODAY. Party
leaves at 4:30pm (prompt) f r o m the Beit
A r c h .
A T L A S T : T H E E N D
With cuts and slashes wounding all
and sundry i n education it is nice to
know that when it comes to the c r u n c h
there is always an escape. C o m e to
think of it, that's a slash and cut as well.
H a p p y Birthday F E L I X , and Colin,
please don't worry about the lunacy of
an aging fool,

Last Saturday's year collection saw
Life Sciences 1 live up to their usual
reputation of apathy. T h i s was an
attitude which was epitomised by
A d r i a n Black who when asked to go out
for the fifth time in twenty four hours
refused on the grounds that he had
already collected over £100. Such was
the extent of this attitude, that they
were too idle to collect the extra
£80.12i/2 needed to make their total up
to £1,000.
Enough of this false modesty, they
were great really (even i f the author is
somewhat biased) and led the way i n
m a k i n g the R C S year collections the
most successful ever with a final total
of £2,636.12i/2. T h e top five year groups
being:
1. Life Sciences 1 — £919.87i/2
2. Physics 1 — £656.89i/2
3. C h e m i s t r y 1 — £515.51
4. M a t h s 1 — £237.32i/2
5. M a t h s 3 — £130.19i/2
The latter insist that they would have
won i f their cover had not been blown in
F E L I X two weeks before the event.
A s ever, the day produced an elitist
clique who collected over one hundred
pounds i n the day: Steve White (CI),
A l a n E d w a r d s (part-time CI), Jane
Lavers (LSI), T o m Hayes (LSI), A d r i a n
Black (LSI), A n d y N e e d h a m (el), M i k e
Booty (Ml) and Steve Sleight (el).
The day was a credit to m a n y people,
especially the first year social reps as
well as to Tansey and M o who were
away f r o m Beit 75 for over eighteen
hours!
General C o m m i t t e e on M o n d a y
prepared the way for next Tuesday's
U G M which will be held at 12:45pm in
Physics Lecture Theatre 1. T h e r e will be
mince pies and free beer f r o m the
Three-Handed Pot, as well as the long
awaited tril of Zoshia.
Also next week are several notab
social events, which are as follows:
T U E S D A Y : Life Sciences C h r i s t m a s
