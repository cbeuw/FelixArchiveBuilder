CITY-AND GUILDS
T i m e for the penultimate F E L I X
article of this term. Due to good
arranging there was a whole week to
recover f r o m Carnival, some of us
needed this. By Sunday enough people
had recovered to participate i n the
rugby sevens. T h i s was a good day out
at Harlington despite the fact that some
of the matches didn't turn out the way
that they were intended. T T won the
plate and the women's team often fared
well despite some of the opposition not
entering into the spirit of the game. The
food afterwards was good and the f i l m
was rather funny.
The nomination papers for H o n Sec
came down last Friday with only one
name on the sheet, so it only remains
for Sara McGuiness to be ratified at the
next U G M . We will be requiring a new
Assistant H o n Sec to be elected at the
next Gen C o m in the spring term.
Anybody who thinks they would like to
stand should come and see Jo in the
office.

Saturday 8 is the Year Rag. T h i s is the
event where all the years of Guilds
compete with each other to collect the
most money during the twenty-four
hours between midnight Friday and
midnight Saturday. So come and collect
the cans on Friday f r o m the U n i o n
Office if you want to start collecting at
midnight. There will be a half barrel for
the year that collects the most and
another for the year that collects the
most per head. We need a good turnout
as R C S collected j£2,700 last week. If you
want to start on Saturday be at the
Office at 9:30am (don't forget your
licences).
Sunday 9 is the Bar Games Night. T h i s
is a slightly more refined Bar Night.
There will be a selection of games such
as cards, nine mans morris, dominoes,
darts, chess and many others. Singing
will also take place as well as a few
quiet pints. Meet in the U n i o n Bar at
7:00pm.
The Christmas U G M is at 12:45 in M E
220 on Tuesday. Father Christmas will
be giving out pressies to the
Exec. Other things will also happen. In
the evening we will go carol singing in
L o n d o n with Scarf. Meet in the Union
Bar at 6:00pm for a really good evening.
There will be mince pies and punch
afterwards in the Union Office.
T h u r s d a y 13 we are going ice skating
at Queens. Meet at the Union Bar at
6:00pm.
Friday is the end of t e r m when we all
get pissed and go home.
As this is the 30th anniversary issue I
decided to look up some information
f r o m the last thirty years.
During the 1950s Guilds were quite
active with large numbers turning up
for the events. M o r p h y Day was similar
to today with more participation f r o m
the boys in blue especially when a brick
wall was built across Putney Towpath
and the trapping of an innocent
pantechnicon. In 1958 Southampton
University stole Bo only to find the
police called in to get it returned as it
was as inviolate then as it is now. The
o l d C & G b u i l d i n g began to be
demolished at the end of the decade. In
1961 the old wooden Spanner was stolen
only to be found three months later in
the left luggage office of a small railway
station near Koblenz in the Rhine
Valley.
Also during the early part of the 1960s
a thirty foot Spanner was fixed to the
side of the new physics building by
some mountaineering Guildsmen. It
took College two days to remove one
night's work. In 1963 we lost Spanner
again and at M o r p h y Day we won the
M o r p h y and L o w r y races and covered
two police motorcyclists in flour and
tomatoes. In 1964 Theta was taken by a
Guildsmen dressed as a waitress
during a Freshers Dinner. In 1965 our
Union Office was furnished. The police'
academy joined in M o r p y y Day in 1967
and they got a bit mucky. 1969 saw ideas
to dissolve the C C U s (things don't
change), 650 people turned up at a
Guilds U G M to protest and a sixty foot
dragon containing twenty Guildsmen
was marched through Harrods. D u r i n g
the years of Jenny Jones, 1974-1975,
Guilds had many mascots.
Cheers, Bryan.
