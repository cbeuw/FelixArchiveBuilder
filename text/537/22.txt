Memorable
Environmental
Week says Roger
Stotesbury
Two of the events were indeed memorable,
and reflect a wide interest in Energy P o l i c y !
refer to the Nuclear Power Debate and the
Energy Future for Britain discussion.These I
will remember for a long time.The other
events were more specialized, of less general
appeal.Yet all were graced by interesting,if in
some cases controversial speakers and held
our attention fortwo hours.In addition the fair
allowed everyone the chance to speak to
various environmentalists and see the
research carried on here connected with the
environment.Thankyou to everyone for
taking part and to those who helped me in any
way.Thanks I've thoroughly enjoyed the
last week and feel pleased that the Union has
been able to contribute to College life in this
way.
