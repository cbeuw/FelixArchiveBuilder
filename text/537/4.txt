TOUCHSTONE REPORT
24 — 25 NOVEMBER
Do y o u listen to Schoenberg or read
Ezra Pound? Do you know who they are?
Perhaps you should know about Touchstone
Weekends. These are informal discussion
weekends organised by Associated Studies
and are open to all members of IC. For the
incredibly low cost of £2.00 to you the
student, you are offered a coach journey to
Silwood Park, just outside Ascot, overnight
accommodation in the country house which
serves as a field-station for IC, great food, and
a chance to express your opinions and take
part in a good discussion. If y o u have
something to say, people will listen. The
subject under discussion varies from
weekend to weekend, but is designed to be
interesting, stimulating and at least mildly
controversial. If you'd come o n the first
weekend you would have been puzzling over
The Control Of Personality. Modern Music
And Literature - Conspiracy Or Lunacy was
the title for this weekend, and if sparks
weren't actually flying, it certainly set
everybodys mind racing. A r e these arts
worked out? Are they s o difficult and
unrewarding? Where do science and society
fit in? The speaker for the weekend, Dr
Rowland Cotterill from the University of
Warwick gave an absorbing review of music
and literature this century with examples
from Stravinsky, G K Chesterton, Berg and
others and offered a set of challenging
questions for the assembled group to resolve.
It's all so different from South Kensington;
on Sunday morning, you can explore the
grounds of Silwood or make your way to
Windsor Great Park; the fresh air is a panacea
for all ills. Associated Studies really do
deserve thanks for filling the gaps that occur
in a college devoted to science and
technology and for providing a thoroughly
enjoyable weekend.
