MADNESS AFFECTS STUDENT
The new album by Madness, that is.
Titled ONE STEP BEYOND it is their
debut album. Of the three groups
currently enjoying success by reviving
ska, whatever that is, Madness are
arguably the best, certainly at writing
good tunes. The Specials' first single
was excellent.but they have since failed
to follow it, and the Selector are really
non-starters.
STIFF
Madness have now changed labels to
Stiff Records from the original ska
revival company, 2-tone. Stiff were
never slow to capitalise on any new
trend, and they have got themselves a
band here who will soon be a very
powerful force in the world of pop. They
are to reggae what the Bootown Rats
were to punk when they started so long
ago, when Peter Powell was an
undreamed nightmare and the Sex
Pistols were still the greatest rock'n'roll
band in the world.
NME
OK so you've read about them in the
music press, you know all about them
already and you have heard the rumours
that some of their fans are NF
supporters, but last week the NME
featured an interview with the band in
which they all renounced the Front, and
one claimed to have some black friends
in the Front as well because they
disliked Greeks and Italians. Surely this
shows the ignorance on which the Front
is based, and bands like this do not
deserve bad publicity because some of
their fans are stupid.
MUSIC
In case you forgot, this is a record review
so I'd better mention the music now.
There are fourteen tracks on this album
and to go through each one in detail, as
all deserve, would only be a bore and
you'd probably stop reading, which you
are not to do O K ? I must therefore
attempt to single out a few tracks which I
shall arbitrarily claim are the best.
SINGLE
Side one begins with the title track One
Step Beyond currently a single and
zooming up the charts. It is typical ofthe
Madness style, heavy on the sax with a
PROF BREMSSTRAHLUNG
Hey Prof' Are
you in there?
reggae beat, inject some rocking guitar
and a loony pianist and the whole thing
vibrates with life.
The next track is a sort of ballad called
My Girl it begins with the line "My girl's
mad at me...." and a heartstring twangs
in every male who ever had a girlfriend
who got mad at him. A gentler approach
this.
Night Boat to Cairo bounces magically
around a middle eastern sound, which
I'll mention again later. The Prince was
their first single and this version is still
very catchy. As we romp on to the end of
side one and we come to....
NUTS
Tarzan's Nuts. If you remember Ron Ely
as Tarzan in that wonderful TV series
you will be zonked by this reggae/ska
version of the theme tune. Side two is
slightly less memorable, but has its
moments. In The Middle Of The Night is
about a nice old newsagent who
unbeknown to his customers nips out
under the cover of darkness to nick their
underwear off the line. (Perhaps a
relative of Arnold Layne?)
SEX
Have you ever wondered what would
happen to Swan Lake if it was given a
reggae beat? Well, you can find out on
this album. It comes out like Egyptian
Reggae; maybe Johnathan Richman
was really ahead of his time. Rocking In
A Flat is the next track and is, as the title
suggests, more tradtional rock'n'roll.
The piano goes fast and furious down
below and the guitaring could be Nick
Lowe in places.
VIOLENCE
Closing the second side is a song called
Chipmunks Are Go, well less of a song,
more of a sort of US Navy chant. It is
great fun to sing the responses when
under the influence: "Sound pff
Chipmunks, Sound off Chipmunks,
1234 1234" and so it goes. The wordsare
easy and don't embafass anyone, so you
could have a go.
VIRGIN
The record can be had for under three
quid at Virgin Records, whom I hate for
chopping a further 70p off the price
since I bought it. G o on, get into the
nuttiest sound around.

ALBUM REVIEW
Survival - Bob Marley and the
Waiters (Tuff Gong/Island ILPS
9542)
This is the first album from Bob Marley and
the Wailers, since Marley's pilgrimage to
Ethiopia (and the rest of Africa) and
consequently the album's main focus is upon
Africa. The cover has the flags of all the
African nations (as w e l l a s t h e Z a p u a n d Z a n u
flags) as well as the storage plan of a slave
ship upon it.
And so to the music. The overall sound is
very polished and is not 'hard' as some of the
sounds currently emanating from J A .
However, the lyrics and music are some of the
most powerful that Marley has written,
especially, 'Zimbabwe', 'Africa Unite', 'One
Drop' 'Babylon System' and 'Wake up and
Live'. The lyrics deal with the problems that
the black man faces today, as Marley sees
them, also the percussion and bass are
consistently good throughout although I felt
that the l-Threes vocals were a little obtrusive
sounding like theShangra-Las' in places. The
many good points of this album far outweigh
the bad, the best part being (in this critic's
eyes) the opening to 'Zimbabwe' - 'Every man
gotta right/To decide his own destiny'-which
sums up the basic message of the album.
This record is Bob Marley at his militant
best and is definitely a record worth buying,
even if you don't like reggae.

SINGLES REVIEW
Steve Hillage - Don't Dither Do It (Virgin)
The intro to this reminds me of that to Pink
Floyd's 'Sheep' on Animals. In fact, the guitar
backing right through the record has a
Floydian feel to it. However, that is where the
semblance ends. There is a continual drum
beat which could make it popular in discos,
but as it isn't very strong this could similarly
be good for a fair amount of radio play.
The lyrics are rather unimaginative, being
merely the title repeated over and over again;
the quality of singing is not particularly good.
Steve Hillage should stick to guitar playing
(at whcih he is exemplorary) and release the
backing track.
To sum up, this is a reasonable single and
'rocks along well', with excellent guitar but
sadly disappointing singing.
