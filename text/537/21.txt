NEWS FROM
THE IC WINE
CELLARS
Any member of the College including
students can buy for personal use direct from
the cellars. A n extensive selection of French
and German wines is available with token
examples from Italy and Yugoslavia. A folder
was prepared last session with some general
notes setting out the aims and aspirations of
the Wine Committee. The folder is designed
to hold some wine lists, one for each of the
major regions, and these have been updated
recently. Copies of the new lists can be
obtained from the Refectory Office, ground
floor, Sherfield. Some of the wines and the
wine list are to be put on display in the
Sherfield Building.
Members of the College are to be encouraged
to experiment and to 'drink their way through'
the choices offered for each region. The
Common Room Wines have been shipped in
bulk by the College direct from France and
represent a better class of wine for the same
price than the usual 'plonk' served in many a
restaurant.
It should be remembered when studying the
wine list that the prices are for use at College
functions and these are to be compared with
those charged in restaurants for wines of
similar quality. T o assist members of the
College with purchases for private use a
discount of seven and a half percent is offered
for orders of six or more bottles, which can be
made for purchases of a single bottle of the
fortified wines (Madeira, Sherry, Port) and of
brandy and spirits. Everyone is welcome to
widen their knowledge by buying from our
cellars but stocks must be protected a n d
substantial orders are not allowed. Stocks
have been laid down of some fine Bordeaux
and Burgundy wines which need to mature
further. T h e 1978 vintage is still lying in
Bordeaux. Stocks of vintage ports, not shown
on the list, are very limited and are to be used
for special College occasions only. Stocks of
the Cockburn 1967 vintage are slightly more
plentiful and this port is drinking very well.
Orders can be placed with the Refectory
Office and should be collected within five
days of ordering. The seven and a half
percent discount applies only to payment
made on collection or against a pro-forma
invoice.

Anyone interested i n becoming a
m e m b e r of Aerosoc can contact me via
the letter racks i n the Aero Dept
(especially those of you who expressed
interest at the beginning of term; I'm
afraid I lost your names). Some of you

considering a career i n aerospace.

IC HOCKEY CLUB
Bank of England fell to the long awaited
backlash from the 3rd team which has had a
series of disappointing results.
The match started with IC doing most of the
attacking but Bank worked their way into the
match and after fifteen minutes Chris Bird
had to save off the line from a Bank short
corner. T w o minutes later IC opened their
account with a goal from a long corner. Phil
Webb was the scorer with a sparkling display
of stickwork.
The second half started well with an early
goal for IC. Chris Pound ended a good run
down the right by passing the ball across the
area to Tim Mitchell who scored with a fierce
shot. Ten minutes later Bank were back in the
match with a well struck goal from a short

If you are a postgraduate, y o u will probably
have received our questionnaire by now. I urge you
to till this in and return it prompty since there is
now a widespread appreciation i n College circles
that P h D s take too long. T h e Registrar has agreed
to compile statistics on the matter a n d if the
postgraduate view could be accurately represented
to h i m (and others;, I a m sure that some effective
discussion could take place.
T h e P G D i n n e r was cancelled d u e to lack o f
interest. I ascribe three causes to this:
corner. However, IC fought back strongly and
victory was secured by a goal from Chris
Pound who this time collected a pass from
Tim Mitchell and placed his shot well. Mark
Talbot's hard work was rewarded when, with
five minutes to go, he forced the ball past the
keeper to give IC their fourth goal. A n y
further attacking moves from Bank were
scared off by Ralph Dean's slide tackles and
the game ended at 4-1 to IC.
The team was: D Moynham, R Dean, C Bird
(Capt), M Clift, P Webb, J Watkin, C Pound, T
Mitchell, J Ebner, M Talbot, D Woollard, D
Benham (sub).
Other results: IC 1sts vs St Bernards
Hospital: 0-6 and Bank of England 2nds vs IC
2nds: 4-2.

TENPIN BOWLING
Last Saturday the annual charity marathon
was played at Birmingham. This involved
bowling from midnight Friday until noon
Saturday with the aim of scoring as many
points as possible.
The Imperial team, scraped up at the last
moment, fought will coming fourth to last,
beating Salford Ladies, Salford B and Brunei
C teams. John Knight (159 average) with
consistent bowling come fourth overall whilst
erratic bowling resulted from the rest of the
team. A few minor injuries were sustained,
mainly to right thumbs, although a severe
scratch appeared on Paul Jeynes' ball after
hitting the gate.
Many thanks to Simon Engwell and
Heather (sexiest member of the team) Jeynes
who bowled at a last minutes notice.
Team: Miss Heather Jeynes, Pete Lucas,
Tim Hillyer, Paul Jeynes, Simon Engwell and
John Knight.
Everyone had a great time and it was a pity
a few more members of the club weren't more
• enthusiastic towards such a good cause
(stiff os).

1. T h e high price of the tickets (£6.50).
2. General postgraduate apathy.
3. T h e unattractive nature of the event (ie it was to
be held i n the evening).
Therefore we shall not be staging a ploughman's
lunch o n T h u r s d a y 13 December at 12:00am in the
U n i o n Concert H a l l . N o b o d y can c o m p l a i n about
this - tickets priced 50p will not be o n sale. T h e r e
won't be a n y free ale and I won't see you there!

IC VOLLEYBALL VICTORIOUS
AGAIN!
After a somewhat debatable start to the
season, IC Volleyball Club have finally
entered into the spirit of the game and have
started to win matches!
Since our last report in FELIX, two further
matches have been played. The first, against
Middlesex, was on 21 November and was won
in a convincing style: 15-6, 15-5, 15-6. T h e
valued points from this match helped us to
gain a few places in the'Seetech League'. The
second match was against Hendon, to whom
we had previously lost earlier in the season —
the IC team really rose to the occasion with a
dramatic victory with a final score of 13-15,
15-3, 15-17, 15-10 a n d 15-11. This h a d
everybody biting their fingernails up until the
very last point had been won.
The victory has taken us into the second
round of the cup, where we should play
against University of London in the second
match.
Thanks are, of course, due to all members
of the teams, without whom this report would
not be possible. These heroes are: M
B a n a s i a k , H S z y s z k o , S K a l i r a i , L
Bogdanowicz, D Penty, S Tarn, P Diaz-
Lalcaca, B Hermanssen, C Wachnicki and A
Ciuksza. Thanks must also go to our few, but
vociferous supporters.
