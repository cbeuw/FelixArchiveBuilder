Sir
On this, not immoderately salubrious occasion, may I most
humbly and I hope graciously, proffer my warmest (and even
most heartfelt) thanks, regards, best wishes congratulations to
your extremely worthy, and notably unpretentious publication;
on reaching its thirtieth anniversary, despite the frequent,
possibly even'boringly, repetitiously, unpunctuatedly regular
occurences of traumatic, catastrophic and usually far-reaching
interruptions, sometimes as if conspired at and effected by an
almost Jesuitical inquisitory panel of warped evil minds (of
obviously, by necessity, awesome and majestic mental
capabilities) intent with total obsession, on their goal of the
complete annihilation of the perpetrators of discussions on the
correct juxtaposition of conjunctions; a topic that reminds me
of the words of dear old Bertrand Russell, it was at a British
Kidney Patients Association Annual Airlines Ball, when whilst
listening to an embarrassingly, interminably uncomfortable
after dinner speech, by the then young Patrick Campbell, that
he turned to me and (in his characteristically, clinical, concise
style) mildly, morosely, murmured, mischievously "maybe, and
and it, but not and and and or and and but, are also but and if,
and if and if, but not if and but and if, despite if but also and
which and and and and and which, being and butthen, not then
and which, but instead but if only, are also which is then and but
not and then, is is is?" "Maybe' I tentatively replied and of course
he was forced, albeit reluctantly, to agree with me, though these
perennial "is is is?" discussions are as objectionably irrelevant
as his sort of unwieldly sentence structure is annoying and
incoherent; that have occurred during this period, that have
occurred during this period.
Yours unobtrusively
