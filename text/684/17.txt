YHA
Out of London
Fed up with London?
Are you tired of spending your weekends
in the noise, dirt and confusion of London?
Would you like a reasonably priced,
enjoyable alternative? Then why not join the
Imperial College Y H A group, and come
along on one (or several) of our fortnightly
escapes from the city?
Every other Friday evening we leave
college, and spend Friday and Saturday night
in a beautiful part of England or Wales;
usually in a Youth Hostel. Saturday and
Sunday are spent walking in the surrounding
countryside enjoying the scenery, fresh air
and rural calm. This term we have already
had a successful trip to the Dorset Coast,
and further trips are planned to Snowdonia,
the Peak District, the Yorkshire Dales and
South Wales. We always aim to be back in
London for last tubes on the Sunday night.
If you like the idea of joining us, come to
one of our weekly meetings on Thursday at
12.30pm in Southside Upper Lounge.
'Butties' and coffee are available, and you
can find out more about our activities. In
addition to the walking trips we also arrange
cinema and theatre trips, pub crawls and
similar social events. We hope to see you
soon at one of our meetings.
MICRO
If you by chance happened to miss the micro-
club stall at the Fresher's Fair, or if you
signed your name on the interest list and
have forgotten all about us, then read on.
The club exists to provide members with
an opportunity to use equipment that they
probably wouldn't be able to afford. We
currently own two B B C model B's (equipped
with disc drives), a N A S C O M 2 with 48K
R A M , an Epson F X 100 dot matrix printer, a
high resolution graphics plotter, an E P R O M
burner and several video monitors.
You may be under the mistaken
impression that all the club cares about is
playing games, but we do cater for the
hardware enthusiast too. We have a full
range of tools and a number of projects
needing attention: examples are a robot-
arm, a N A S C O M disc interface, a speech
synthisiser and 'BORIS'; an antiquated 6800
microcumputer system.
All the equipment is located in our own
room, number 401 in the Mines building and
the advantage of joining the club is that
members can have access to these facilities
at any time that the building is open.
New members or those interested in
joining might like to come along and make
some suggestions on what hardware we
should buy, or any event you think we should
hold in the future. The club room is always
open on Wednesday afternoons, so if you
fancy joining them drop in with £2.00 — we'd
be happy to take it off you!
JEWISH
~
Friday night
meals
Last week saw the start of another eventful
Jeweish Society year with the highly
successful Freshers' Party, complete with
the traditional 'Bagel 'n' chocolate spread', in
which large numbers of enthusiasts indulged.
This is naturally only the beginning of all
those exciting events. Tonight is the first of
our Friday Night Meals. These are always
enjoyable with an informal atmosphere
prevailing. If you are interested, meet under
Beit Arch at 6.30pm, Friday, 26 October,
bringing £1 worth of dairy/Kosher food.
There will of course be a series of speakers
this term. A n important date to note is
Thursday 15 November, when Julian
Sorsby, Executive Director of Ravenswood
Village for the Mentally Handicapped, will be
coming to talk at IC.
Hopefully a trip will be organised at some
point to the first Jewish Film Festival which
opens at the National Film Theatre this
week.
Don't forget, if you are a fresher, the free
Kosher lunch is STILL A V A I L A B L E . If you
are interested in this or any other aspect of
IC J-Soc, then please contact Josie
Glausiusz, Life Sci 2.

News
A n exhibition of Soviet scientific
publications will be held in the Science
Museum Library, 19-24 November. The
books exhibited will be examples of Soviet
publishing in the English language in
science and technology. For those of you
who remember, the Bookshop staged a
similar exhibition two years ago, which
was extremely popular. As to whether the
books^will be available for us to stock at
this moment in time, I cannot say.
