will be a one day symposium
entitled 21st Century Technology
as well as a related exhibition
entitled 'Technology 2000'. The
symposium, to be held on 27th
February 1985, will examine the
implications and opportunities
for industry, education and
employment presented by the
technology currently being
developed, as well as the
continuing role of the engineer in
wealth creation.
There will be many disting-
uished speakers including the
Rector, Lord Flowers, who will
explore the ways of informing
society so that it can benefit from
the technical advances of the next
century and the demands of this
society on the democratic
decision-making process. Other
speakers willinclude Professor
Igar Aleksander the current
holder of the Kobler Chair in the
Management of Information
Technology of Imperial College;

More than a few eyebrows were
raised when it was announced
that the Rector had appointed
Professor Bruce Sayers to replace
Professor Manny Lehman as
head of the Department of
Computing. In an unprecidented
move Prof Sayers went to his new
position directly from the
headship of Elec Eng. At the time
cynics, including most of DoC's
academic staff, were of the
opinion that he didn't know
enough about the latest research
in D o C , since his field of research
is electrical engineering applied
to medicine. The reason given for
such an unorthodox appoint-
ment (headships are normally
passed round senior academics in
a department on a 'Buggin's turn'
principle) was that the Rector
considered the department's
research had become concen-
trated in too narrow a field. Some
believed that perhaps this was an
enlightened decision on the part
of Lord Flowers, but it seems
that those who took the opposite
view have been proved right. The
department's morale is slipping,
there have been major semi-
public rows between senior
academics and the new head, and
the general bad feeling which has
been created is starting to
adversely affecting undergrad-
uate teaching.
Stoic, the Student Television of
I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e , is an
organization which has long been
the butt of many jokes in Union
circles. This small but extremely
earnest bunch of dedicated
cameramen, sound recordists,
producers, directors, presenters,
interviewers, etc make weekly
news a n d e n t e r t a i n m e n t
programmes. Unfortunately this
is largely for their own benefit (to
boost their chances of a career in
television) since their 'campus
network' is so limited more
people are involved in making
the programmes than watching
them! Neither are they renowned
for being overly competent,
although the biscuit was well and
truly taken last week when they
rang up the F E L I X Office and
asked us to look in the 'Diary'
page and tell them which
programmes they were showing
this week!
