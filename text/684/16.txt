POETRY
What we
do during
travel
You can't beat the time
—table, so relax, go languid.
Write you r own book, g o o n —
I know you can. Or there is
always the Sony Walkman.
Right, so the Walkman is out
of batteries, the person next to
you has rampant halitosis,
and you never carry reams of
paper or a word procesor.
What you need is some poems
to read. Oh, yes you do.
It goes something like this:
A poem may well be about
people wandering lonely as
c l o u d s , c o m p a r i n g t h e i r
friends to summer days and
mincing about snivelling into
their hankies. If you find one
like that, you can alwaystear it
out and use it as your hanky.
Fair enough, but there is the
other kind.
When a writer decides that
an idea has to go into this
format, he must use language
at some density. Think it out
— a short story uses five
thousand or so words to put
across either a point, or
something which reads like
the outline of a bigger book. A
good poet can say anything
he has to say in perhaps two
hundred words, and that is
why you need to carry poems
alongside your railcard. They
take hours to read and re-
read, and take up a lot less
space than 'War and Peace'.
So let's go. Where do we
start?
Let's say 20th Century only. A
lot less trouble that way. And
who could be betterthan blunt
— speaking Ted Hughes?
Go for it, Ted:
The Jaguar
(extract)
...tiger and lion
Lie still as the sun. The boa-
constrictor's coil
Is a fossil. Cage after cage
seems empty, or
Stinks of sleepers from the
breathing straw.
It might be painted on a
nursery wall.
But who runs like the rest past
these arrives
At a cage where the crowd
stands, stares, mesmerised,
As a child at a dream, at a
jaguar hurrying enraged
Through prison darkness
after the drills of his eyes
On a short fierce fuse. Not in
boredom -
The eye satisfied to be blind in
fire,
By the bang of blood in the
brain deaf the ear -
He spins from the bars, but
there's no cage to him
Simple enough at first
glance, but read it like you
play records — over and over
again. Then you can follow
different threads on each
reading (base line, harmony,
singer, rhythm). Just to start
you off: the slow, sleepy
o p e n i n g is set in short
sentences, which makes it
appropriately slow to read.
Once the jaguaris introduced,
sentences run into each other
c o n v e y i n g u r g e n c y . T h e
sound of phrases is put to
work. Try saying: 'Stinks of
sleepers from the breathing
straw.' and then: 'By the bang
of blood in the brain deaf..'
See what I mean?
Hmm. Lecture over. Hughes
isn't the only one fired-up by
this Force-Of-Nature bit. Put
on your Richard Burton voice
and stick a leek on your lapel.
D y l a n T h o m a s , take the
stage...
The Force That Through The
Green Fuse Drives The
Flower.
(Extract)
The force that through the
green fuse drives the flower
Drives my green age; that
blasts the roots of trees
Is my destroyer.
And I am dumb to tell the
crooked rose
My youth is bent by the same
wintry fever.
The force that drives the water
through the rocks
Drives my red blood; that dries
the mouthing streams
Turns mine to wax.
And I am dumb to mouth unto
my veins
How at the mountain spring
the same mouth sucks.
It might be fun to spend a
holiday standing on a Welsh
mountain in a thunderstorm,
howling this theatrical verse at
p a s s i n g f a r m a n i m a l s .
Certifiable, I admit, but it
would make a change.
Then there is T S Eliot. He
writes H U G E poems. Well, he
did, anyway. Despite his
interest in r e i n c a r n a t i o n
rituals, he is still six feet under.
It is difficult to do justice to his
stuff in a small space, but this
is a bit of one of the earlier
ones.
The Love Song of J Alfred
Prufrock
(extract)
Let us go then, you and I,
When the evening is spread
out against the sky
Like a patient etherised upon
a table;
Let us go, through certain
half-deserted streets,
The muttering retreats
Of restless nights in one-night
cheap hotels
And sawdust restaurants with
oyster-shells:
Streets that follow like a
tedious argument
Of insidious intent
To lead you to an overwhelm-
ing question...
Oh, do not ask, 'What is it?'
Let us go and make our visit.
In the room the women
come and go
Talking of Michelangelo.
Reading Eliot will give you
that shell-shocked, soulful
look that people mistake for
deep appreciation. Look the
part, and the rest will follow. A
different type altogether is
Thorn Gunn. He likes writing
about motorcyclists and their
e x i s t e n t i a l m e t h o d s of
s u i c i d e . M i g h t s o u n d
contradictory to you, but who
gives a toss — this is art.
Mister Gunn gets the last
word:
The Feel of Hands
(extract)
The hands explore tentatively,
two small live entities whose
shapes
I have to guess at...
There is a sudden transition:
they plunge together in a full-
formed fury: they are grown
to cats, hunting without
scruple;
they are expert but desperate.
I am in the dark. I wonder
when they grew up. It strikes
me that
I don not know whose hands
these are.
