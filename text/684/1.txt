Rector slams
Education Policy
In his keynote Commemoration
day speech yesterday the Rector,
L o r d F l o w e r s , c r i t i c i z e d
Government Education Policy as
well as speaking of the
continuing process of change in
the Universities. He encouraged
the recruitment of more women
into science and engineering.
In the ceremony in the Royal
Albert Hall the Rector gave a
brief history of the College
emphasising the change that had
occured already, and the changes
still to come.
He foresaw 'a gradual erosion
of the binary line between
Universities and Polytechnics,'
and in addition a change in the
funding of the College to respond
to external demands following
the recommendations of the
University Grants Committee to
the Government
He moved on to congratulate
'the central figures in our
ceremony', the 982 undergrad-
uates and 765 postgraduates who
were nerviously waiting to
become admitted as graduates.
He extended these congrat-
ulations to the parents for
'getting their children this far'. A
special tribute was also given to
the sixth form teachers who
ensue the receipt of 'a large
number of applications that fit
the exacting entry requirements
of an institution that is dedicated
to academic and professional
excellence at the highest level'.
He continued by elaborating
on the 'interface problem'
between the s i x t h f o r m
curriculum, because school
students 'come up inadequately
prepared to study for an honours
degree', and the narrow range of
'A'-Level subjects required by
Universities. There has however
been a compromise as all the
Universities are now committed
to AS level courses which are
intended to broaden and
s u p p l e m e n t the A level
curriculum. Lord Flowers is keen
to see the implementation of A S
levels inorder to 'get rid of the
evils of over-specialization'.
Following an attack on the
government education policy,
which has lead to 'damage from
which the Universities are
unlikely to recover for a long
time', he praised Sir Keith
Joseph, Secretary of State for
education who o r i g i n a l l y
proposed AS level courses.

In what must be one of the
biggest scoops inrecent years,
Dave Allen and Charles Troup,
the Imperial College Social
Secretary and Guilds Ents
Chairman, announced that they
have booked two legendary acts
from the sixties and seventies to
play in College.
Mud, the band that gave us,
'Tiger Feet', 'Oh Boy' and
' L o n e l y this C h r i s t m a s '
(probably the corniest number
one record of all time..) will play
at the Guilds Carnival later this
term.
Somewhat sooner, in fact only
one and a half weeks away, you
will be able to see Geno
Washington, the famous soul
singer of the Sixties, performing
at the End of the World Party.
The great man has agreed to do a
one-off concert to 'celebrate' the
outcome of the American
Presidential Elections, which
take place that week.
Messrs Allen & Thoup, both
dedicated Geno Washington
fans, said they were 'absolutley
over the moon' about the
forthcoming concert by Geno
Washington. No comment was
made about Mud except to
express astonishment that they
were still alive...
