SINGLES
Tom Robinson: Rikki, Don't
Lose That Number
Tom has one of the best
voices in the business, and on
this latest single he uses it to
the full. He's had a rough time
overtheyears, shunned by the
music press for being gay, and
shunned by the public for
being 'arty'. Hopefully, after
'War', this will be his 2nd big
success.
Hazel O'Connor: Cuts Too
Deep
Dragged from obscurity to
stardom by the film'Breaking
Glass', it had seemed Hazel
had returned to her roots with
b l a n d s o n g s , a n d n o
enthusiasm, but with'Cuts too
Deep' she regains her old
vitality and appealing voice. I
still prefer 'Will You' but don't
put this down too quickly.
Keep it for late at night —
alone. Then listen again — it's
got wonderful lyrics.
Paul McCartney: No More
Lonely Nights
OK, so it's Top 10 already,
possibly even No 1 bythetime
you read this, but I've only just
got it, and I had to review the
best single by my favourite
artist in many years. G o stuff
'Pipes of Peace' Paul; this is
infinitely better. Simplicity,
melody, quality: If only he'd
put a decent end on it, instead
of leaving the film soundtrack
guitar fade, I would have no
criticisms. Album's out this
week. Buy it!
Eddy Grant: Soys In The
Street
No-one seems to know what
Eddy is doing these days.
Obviously fed up with waiting
for a new release, his record
company have remixed this
from 'Going for Broke'. Hardly
surprisingly it's not up to
much. 'Wish I was back in
West India' G r a n t s i n g s .
Maybe, that's where he's
gone?
English Evenings: Tear You
Down
After the minor success of
their first single 'What's the
matter with Helen', Graham
Lee & Lee Walsh have spent a
year on a debut album 'After
Dark'. If this first taster from it
is representative, it's going to
be pretty hot. Very clubby.
Very funky. Very danceable.
Watch out for the 12 inch
Dorian Gray mix. G o o d stuff.
CINEMA
Conan the
destroyer
The film opens with Conan
(Schwarzenegger) still pining
for his lost love Valeria. Soon
he is w a y l a i d by t h e
treacherous (and dead sexy)
Q u e e n T a r a m i s ( S a r a h
D o u g l a s ) . T h e q u e e n
promises to bring Valeria back
to life if Conan accompanies
her niece Princess Jehnna
(Olivia D'uba) on a quest for a
magical key that will unlock a
mysterious treasure. Conan
reluctantly sets off with the
princess and the queen's chief
guard Bombaata. There after
the plot is totally convention-
al, the hero having been
recruited, accomplishes the
mission only to find on return
much treachery and evil,
largely in the form of the
hideous (or is it hilarious?)
god D a g o t h w h o m he
promptly vanquishes.
T h i s f i l m b e a r s little
resemblance to its predeces-
sor— 'Canan the Barbarian'—
in which its director (Milius)
gives the mythical element of
the Conan story much more
gravity. This myth is played
down in Destroyer, both by
the S c r e e n - w r i t e r s a n d
Fleischer (the director), in
favour of a tongue in cheek
adventure. This I think is a
shame, as it was this very
myth/story telling style, as
handled by Milius, which gave
Barbarian both its power and
originality. Barbarian was also
an adu It m o v i e , u n l i k e
Destroyer. The characters
and their relationships were
d e v e l o p e d in the m o r e
rarefied moments of the film
and this emotional content
not only gave the film depth
but also heightened the set-
pieces of action when they
ZZREVIEWSD
came. Barbarian also showed
c o n s i d e r a b l e style in its
humour and even its violence.
In short Barbarian had 'class'
and it's exactly this class that
Destroyer lacks.
One might sympathize with
F l e i s c h e r w h o , t h o u g h
conventional, is still totally
professional and necessarily
skilful given some bad casting
in the form of Grace Jones
and Tracey Walter (Malak).
T h e P r o d u c e r s d o u b t l e s s
pushed Fleischer for a teeny-
boppers movie.
But for all this, its still a jolly
good romp and very enjoyable
— if you let it be. A n d you can
leave the cinema safe in the
knowledge that 'the good' will
a l w a y s d i s m e m b e r a n y
mutant muppet that dares
declare itself a god and virgins
