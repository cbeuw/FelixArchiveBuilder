TOAD IN THE HOLE GOULDER
I a m indebted to my friend Goulder for this variation on 'basic
toad'.
Do use good ingredients — premium pork sausages in this
case. What makes home cooking so good is being able to
choose top-quality ingredients with variations to suit your own
taste — I use herb sausages and whole-seed mustard.
Shake the flour into a mixing bowl, gently blend in the eggs,
then the mustard, salt and milk. Beat until the mixture is smooth
and has lots of little air bubbles, leave to'rest'in the fridge for 30
minutes. Heat the oven to maximum. While it is heating peel and
slice the onions. Pour the fat into a deep-sided baking tin and
put in the oven. Get the sausages ready and have the batter
handy — the hotter the baking dish when the batter goes in the
better the result. After the onions have cooked for five minutes
add the sausages and batter. Return to the oven. D O N ' T L O O K
for 20 minutes. Take a quick peep — if it's a soft gold it's ready —
ovens vary and it may take longer.
Adding a teaspoon of sugar to the batter mix is bad for your
health, but good for your reputation as a cook.
