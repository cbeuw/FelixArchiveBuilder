The Careers Directories are best summed
up by the phrase G O G E T a D O G and
R O G E T . To give them their full titles, they
are called Graduate Opportunities (big and
thick), Graduate Employment and Training
(compact), Directory of Opportunities for
Graduates (small but informative) and
Register of Graduate Employment and
Training (the Careers Advisers' version). All
contain details of a large number of
employers. G E T tops the list with addresses
of over 2000 companies. Since they all
include a slightly different group of
employers you may have to ferret around to
find the one with details of your favourite
company. Most of them have an index which
can be understood in under five minutes so
that you can find a list of employers of
Chemical Engineers or whatever is your
bent. Some have geographical breakdown
giving details of employers in various parts of
the country but these are not as good as the
local lists of graduate recruiters in the
Careers Library.
R O G E T contains a very useful set of job
descriptions; useful because they give you
details of the activities which various areas of
work include. Ask yourself 'Can I really
imagine myself doing that particular kind of
work?' Y o u may sometimes be surprised by
your reactions.
All the directories contain editorial
material on various topics including career
choice, the search for a suitable employer,
developing areas of employment, how to
apply for a job and the selection process.
There are however, a range of 70 Careers
Information Booklets freely available in the
Careers Library on almost every career you
can think of from Actuary to Zoologist.
D O G is different from the others because
it comes in four different species and
contains much more editorial material. D O G
1 is about careers in finance; D O G 2 about
careers related to science, engineering and
computing; D O G 3 deals with business
careers including marketing and D O G 4 is
about postgraduate courses and the pros
and cons of studying for a further degree.
( D O G 3 and 4 should be available in
November). Supplies of these free handouts
are somewhat restricted but you should be
able to select at least one copy for your own
reference. Please be prepared to share or
exchange with other final year students.'

a Job'
Why do you wish to work for Roly Poly
Foods?
( T h i n k ! . . . I don't k n o w . . . D o I?)
Pause...(Thinks...again A h yes!)
As a Mechanical Engineer with an interest
in a career in Production Engineering, I have
always been fascinated by production
processes not least in the food industry. A
recent course on flexible manufacturing
systems has increased my interest in
automation techniques and process control,
etc...
At Roly Poly Foods the range of products
you produce must require a wide variety of
manufacturing techniques... reading your
graduate recruitment brochure, I am
attracted by the training you provide and the
work in which your recent graduates are
involved. It seems an environment in which I
could soon make a contribution.
Well something like that would perhaps
make a reasonable answer to a difficult
question of this kind. Here are a few tips
about application forms.
First of all read the form through before
you start. Use black ink so that it can be
photocopied. Be sure that your replies are
'Gius
legible and without spelling mistakes. Avoid
three word replies. Don't tell the employer
what they can do for you but rather what
contribution you can make. Pay attention to
the layout of your words in the space
provided. Try to be positive about your
successes.
These are the basic requirements. Try also
to be original and avoid giving the same
answer as your friend. It is particuarly
important to avoid hackneyed phrases like 'I
want to work with people'. One final tip —
don't assume that employers are only
interested in your studies. If you can write
about spare time activities which provide
evidence of team work, leadership, initiative
on your part, commercial flair or practical,
literary, verbal or numerical skills, all the
better. Last of all, if you are about to get a
PhD for studying Saturn's rings or some
other subject not frequently heard of in the
industrial world, don't put yourself forward
as someone who knows a great deal about
next to nothing. It is the skills you have
developed which are important — analysis,
logic, problem solving, report writing and so
on — not necessarily the subject itself.
