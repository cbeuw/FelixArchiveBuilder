IC vs Sussex Univ 17.10.84
A bleak Sussex golf course saw
Imperial's first ever official golf
match, the result of which
matched the weather rather well.
Many excuses are available,
however, such as none of the IC
team knowing each other —
which cast an air of uneasiness
over the proceedings.
Another problem which no
doubt arose from inexperience,
was that the six IC players only
had one golf club between them
(although one Sussex player
thought it closely resembled a
snooker cue.) This obviously
made the whole game rather
slow, the only real excitement
coming from P Hollin's colossal
driving.
SNOOKER
IC Potted!
IC - 6 Harrington - 6
This visiting team, might well
have been forgiven for forgetting
that they were playing away.
Along with last year's president,
Andy Gannaway and the ' A '
team captain from last year,
Andy Hurford, the visit of
Harrington also saw the return of
Chris Jennings and John White,
both former presidents of IC
Snooker club.
As to the game itself IC can
feel disappointed with having to
settle for a sharing of the points.
Although the Imperial team
started well and led for most of
the game they were unable to
clinch the frame needed to win
the match and the visitors,
obviously anxious not to lose on
returning to their old club took
advantage as IC began to fade to
capture half of the 12 frames in
the first home game of the
season for Imperial.
IC — 3 Tate &Lyle — 9 16.10.84
Every now and again there is a
match in which most of the
members of the team manage to
play badly at the same time.
Against Tate & Lyle such a
coincidence of events occurred.
IC never really got into the game
and frames slipped away leaving
us on the receiving end of a
thrashing.

Track & Field News
Last Sunday, the new Track and
Field Section of the >-iub turned
out in force (4 men shame on you
girls!), to the Inter-Collegiate
Relays at Motspar Park, Surrey,
where we competed in the
4x100m, 4x400m relays
In the 4x100m there were two
heats. In the first heat IC
annihilated the opposition and
were promptly disqualified for
changing baton outside the
changeover box.
Imperial went some way to
making it up 10 minutes later by
winning the 4x400 in relay.
ORIENTEERING
Lost in
Holmbush
'Holmbush Revisited'.
On Sunday the O-Club arrived at
Holmbush in an assortment of
vehicles (none of them an IC
minibus — thanks, Eric) for a
score event.
The IC men (and four ladies!)
competed with varying degrees
of success. A few finished well-
up, despite falling in pits/getting
lost at the first control/running
right past the finish. A few, alas,
were still out in the forest while
the rest dehydrated in a nearby
pub!
Strong
Pack
IC 2ndXV-18St Thomas's 2nd
XV-0
IC, despite some notable
absentees in key' positions,
produced a fine performance to
defeat a competent St Thomas's
team, last Saturday. The IC
pack, produced a plentiful suppy
of ball from both scrum and loose
phase. However due to the
severity of the conditions and
some early poor handling in the
backs.
SAILING

Win
IC—1 beat U E A
IC A v U E A Old Boys — match
abandoned (eventually).
The Sailing Club bandwagon
travelled to Oulton Broads last
weekend to be greeted an icy
cold force seven wind which
threatened to make any racing
impossible. IC 1 soon moved into
a winning position against LJEA,
although the Coypu Brothers
were involved in several dicey
incidents which ultimately
resulted in their capsize and near
drawing in the 'Waveney Water'.
Never-the-less the remaining
team members stayed upright
and notched up a fine victory.

Man
UAU vs Sussex
A look at the results sheet
would suggest that Imperial had
a fairly successful day. However,
there is a gloomy picture behind
the figures. It was embarassing to
turn out two incomplete teams
and IC can only keep apologising
to Andy McAleer who made the
journey only to find he didn't
have a partner. The remaining
group matches are all in London
so IC have no excuse for not
fielding six players in each team.
Mens /
Where was the sixth man? IC
lost the match 5-4 having
conceded three games before
the match started. Sussex were
not a strong side, having only one
proficient pair. This must go
down as a match we should have
won.
Mens II
A 5-4 win with three conceded
games again. Imperial first pair
did the damage by beating their
first pair in straight sets. Then it
was routine for both pairs to
clean-up the Sussex 2nd and 3rd
pairs. The standard of play was
suprisingly low but it still feels
good to win.
Ladies
Apparently, the rumours of
our magnificient six had not
spread as far afield as Sussex for
they actually gave us an
opposition to play (unlike Guys
and LSE!) Our quality of mercy
was not strained (it droppeth as
the gentle rain from heaven —
Merchant of Venice — ed).
Imperial gave them two games
resulting in a 7-2 victory.

Two of the four crews entered in

convincingly beating their
nearest rivals Molesey by 15
seconds.
