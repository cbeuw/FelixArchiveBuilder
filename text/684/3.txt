Mooney mix-up
The awful truth revealed!
Four recent incidents when beef
was advertised and sold as lamb
in the College refectory were
explained yesterday. M r Victor
Mooney, Refectory Manager,
divulged that a memo circulated
to the staff about the matter had
the words 'beef and iamb' the
wrong way round.
'All memos in the refectory
system are written in English
with a Spanish translation,' said
M r Mooney. 'Unfortunately, my
previous secretary translated
beef as lamb and lamb as beef.'
Since the memo was written, in
September 1962, all the Spanish
refectory staff have served beef
when asked for lamb.
Any Hindu student eating so-
called iamb stew' (beef)commits
a grave sin, as the cow is a sacred
animal in the Hindu faith. 'We all
had a jolly good laugh about it, I
can tell you!', said M r Mooney.
Senor Pedro Gomez, Chief Chef
and Bottle Washer said to
F E L I X 'Don't ask me, I only
heat it up'.
'Par que no alquilan un
cocinero en lugar di un pindre
para haner la comida?' he
remarked.
Mr Mooney has announced
ptans to cope with competition
from the highly successful
Union-run Refectory.
'We have put up our prices
already,' he boasted, and I am
taking steps to lower the quality
of the food even further,
although I anticipate some
difficulties from Pedigree Chum
our suppliers'.
'There will be less staff, and
tills will be kept short of change.
There is not a lot more I can do. I
want to create so much demand
for Union Refectory food that
they will be unable to cope with
it. They will have to close down in
a matter of months'.
His new advertising slogan
'Eat Mooney for diarrhoea and
scurvy' is expected to hit campus
next week.
Alarming!
Rape alarms will still be given
away free by the IC Union after a
proposal to charge for them was
heavily defeated at the Council
meeting on Monday evening.
Council is the most powerful
Union committee and controls
finance and the general running
of the Union.
Deputy President, Dave Parry
had included in his report a
recommendation that a charge of
25p should be made for the
alarms. IC Union gives away
between one and two hundred
alarms, which cost £1.27 each, a
year. M r Parry told Council that
this was a major drain on the
Welfare Budget. A 25p charge, he
argued, would allow more alarms
to be bought and cover some of
the administration charges. Mike
Stuart, Welfare Officer, who
opposed the report said that the
Welfare Committee only had
problems paying for rape alarms
because its budget had been cut.
Hugh Southey, also opposing,
told Council that as a responsible
Union, I C U should make every
effort to ensure women carried
rape alarms.

EXHIBIT in South Ken
The entry ticket, printed before
your eyes and issued free for
access at a specified time is the
first hint of the enormous
amount of money spent on
EXHIBITS, the I B M exhibition
of Information Technology. This
mobile exhibition is currently
housed in a unique transparent
structure designed by an Italian
Architect and set in the grounds
of the Natural History Museum.
By the end of 1987 if will have
visited 20 cities in 14 European
Countries.
E X H I B I T is an impressive
insight into the future and is
divided into three main areas:-
'Technology' is a fascinating
display of what is currently
available and how it is made. The
emphasis is on chips, not the
potato variety, showing their
production, testing and use in
computer. Other advances
include demonstrations of
holographic scanner which can
read bar-codes in supermarket
checkouts, a three dimensional
display of the E X H I B I T
building, the Videotex link to
data banks and and two new I B M
PC plus personal computers with
very high resolution graphics.
' C o m p u t e r G a m e s ' i s ,
provided there are only a few
children around, an excellent
chance to try out many different
kinds of softwear. As well as a
few games there are opportun-
ities to write a comic strip
scenario, paint, draw with a light
pen, spot counterfeit coins with
the aid of a robot and use a touch
sensitive screen to find your way
around New York (a strange
choice on a European tour—still
it is only a demonstration).
'Researching into the future' is
a small but interesting part of the
exhibition. There are displays of
current work such as voice
recognition and applications of
computers to other disciplines
for research purposes. A project
from France is teaching deaf-
mute children to talk by adopting
sound waves into contours
which appear on the screen and
can be copied. There is also a film
about Scanning Tunnelling
Microscopy (STM) a technique
developed by I B M , of course,
which can produce an image of a
solid in three dimensions with
r e s o l u t i o n d o w n to 0.01
nanometre — the size of an atom.
Despite the temptation,
among all these computers to
have computerised explanations,
the exhibition is full of very
human people to answer any and
every question you may have. It
is a well planned display and is
just like stepping into the future
(for a biochemist, anyway).
E X H I B I T will appeal to anyone
who wants to know what the
future will bring and is highly
recommended.
E X H I B I T is open daily
Monday to Saturday from 10am-
6pm and Sunday 2.30-6.00pm
until 2nd December. Admission
is free.
IBM are offering a special
preview of the Exhibition with a
buffet to IC students and staff on
Wednesday 7th November from
6.45pm-8.45pm. Tickets on a
first-come first-serve basis are
available now from the Public
Relations Office, Sherfield.
FELIX Friday 26 October 1984
