A successful challenge to quorum after one hour and nine minutes of
business prevented several imporant motions on Union publicity and
changes in the voting schedule being discussed at yesterday's Union
General Meeting.
A motion on Union publicity, prompted by one of the H G Wells
Society's posters for Freshers' Fair, had been expected to draw a
large crowd. However, because of lack of publicity the meeting was
obviously inquorate from the start.
Although no policy was made
the meeting was useful in that it
accepted the ratification of a
large number of elections at
previous U G M s . Several other
posts were also filled; J o n
Stanley was ratified as External
Affairs Committee Secretary, P
Simion as ordinary member of
the Permanent Working Party
and Christine Teller and Peter
Burt as delegates to the Univer-
sity of London Union General
Union Council.
This business was transacted
during Mary Freeman's report
as returning officer with a
minimum of trouble, as was
Stephen Goulder's report as
President and Miss Freeman's
report as Honorary Secretary.
However the meeting was closed
during Miss Freeman's third
visit to the microphone during
the motion on the changes to the
voting schedule. Miss Freeman
proposed the motion claiming
that the existing schedule was
wooly and citing the last sabbati-
cal elections as an example. Jon
Stanley opposed the motion on
the grounds that the schedule
was clear and correct and any
confusion was caused by wooli-
ness on behalf of the returning
No. 622 H B H H B H H H
officer. During questions Miss
Freeman stated that the amend-
ments had been approved by the
Electoral Reform Society.
Procedural motions were then
put to refer the motion either to
the next U G M or the Permanent
Working Party but before this
was decided quorum was called
by Miss Caroline Scott of Elec
Eng 1 and the meeting closed at
2:17pm.

FAILS
An attempt to clamp down on
offensive advertising material in
College failed yesterday when the
Union General Meeting was
declared inquorate.
A motion was to have been
proposed .by a representative of
Women in Science and Tech-
nology (WIST), the women's
rights group, after the public-
ation of an allegedly offensive
cover on Guildsheet, the City
and Guilds Union magazine. In
addition, complaints had been
made about a poster advertising
the H G Wells Society. The
motion suggested that on receipt
of a petition signed by twenty or
more U n i o n members, the
House Committee should con
sider a complaint concerning
any offensive poster. If this
complaint were to be upheld, the
offending society would be
fined, and after two offences
permission for that society to
display posters would be with-
drawn.
At present any posters for
display may only be put up with
the permission of the U n i o n
Publicity Officer or the Hon-
orary Secretary. In the past,
however, permission has been
reasonably automatic, subject to
the Publicity Rules.
In the proposed amendment,
Mary Freeman was going to
draw attention to several posters
which had been found offensive
by certain groups at college.
Although officials of Wellsoc
were considering making a
formal apology at the U G M , it
was declared inquorate before
this was possible. The motion is
expected to come up at the next
quorate U G M .
