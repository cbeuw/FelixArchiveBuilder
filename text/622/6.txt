Woody Allen's latest film A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy/ (AA,
A B C s ) looks pretty dull from the publicity, but it turns out to be one of
the most subtle and funny films in recent memory.
Having kicked his Fellini period (Manhattan, Stardust Memories),
he's back to glorious colour and a fairly direct story about three couples
spending a beautiful summer's day together. In typical Allen style all six
have a complex relationship and weird personal anxieties; Allen himself
is a madcap inventor (slightly out of place in the turn of the century
setting) with a frigid wife played by the talented Mary Steenburgen. His
wife's elderly cousin Leopold (Jose Ferrer) arrives at their country home
with his bride-to-be Ariel (the beautiful Mia Farrow). Maxwell (Tony
Roberts) and his 'experienced' girlfriend Dulcy (Julie Hagerty) make up
the sextet.
By a series of complex twists Allen lampoons romance, marriage,
philosophy (as ever) and, of course, sex. The film is by no means a 'knee
slapper' and does not have the pace of Annie Hall, but it is certainly a
very enjoyable and entertaining piece. Allen's wisecracks come thick
a n d fast a n d the beautiful filming, c o u p l e d with M e n d e l s s o h n ' s
atmospheric score, is a real bonus.
I was very glad that Allen has chosen to move forward with a subtle,
clever comedy which is not just a remake of his greatest hit, Annie Hall.
Catch this one if you can.

In case you missed Freshers' FELIX, this is the new detailed
guide to what's on in and around IC. It is a mixture of fact
supplied by the society placing the ad, and comments from the
supposedly cynical and witty FELIX staff.
FELIX can, obviously, except no responsibility for any errors
howsoever caused (ie cock-ups can not be blamed on FELIX),
however it does help if we actually receive the correct times,
dates and places
// the What's On feature is going to be a success we must be
contacted before the deadline (5:30 Monday, rigidly enforced). It
would also help if the society secretaries could write a few words
about what they are promoting and send a photo that is
appropriate for the event. Hopefully you like the idea of the
Whaf's On feature and find it useful when you forget just what
time the gig/concert/party/lecture starts.
