A new pressure group has been formed to oppose the
government's education funding. Simon Rodan, the Union's
External Affiars Officer, and Steve Goulder, the President, explain
why it deserves our support.
E d u c a t i o n a l A l l i a n c e
On Wednesday October 13, the Educational Alliance, in conjunction
with the University of London Union, is staging a rally. Its purpose is to
try to focus media attention on the ludicrous nature of the Department
of Education and Science's current attempts at cutting back
expenditure in education.
The Educational Alliance was
formed this year in a concerted
attempt by v a r i o u s groups
involved in the field of education
to call to a halt the severe scaling
down that is at present being
i m p l e m e n t e d . T h e A l l i a n c e
represents University teaching
staff, students, and all non-
academic staff employed by the
universities as well as involving
teachers and parent-teacher
organisations from secondary
education. Clearly, it is not just
one part of the system that is
objecting, but everybody in-
volved in a unanimous rejection
of current D E S policy.
Some examples of the anoma-
lies in the present round of cuts
show the lack of long term
thought that has gone into the
policy making so far. Salford
and Aston are two technological
universities which are turning
out science and engineering
graduates who are the top
priority requirement of the
manufacturing industries. Both
have suffered enormous cuts
while other institutions, Oxford,
Cambridge and Bristol spring
readily to mind, which have very
smaller fractions of science and
engineering graduates have not
suffered at all.
Thus, in ten years hence there
will probably be, as a direct
result, a shortage of qualified
professional technologists which
can only be detrimental to the
c o u n t r y ' s e c o n o m y a n d
industrial base.
Another example nearer home
could be drawn from the drastic
reorganisation being brought
about within the University of
London as a consequence of the
shortage of funds. Q E C to avoid
complete closure has had to seek
merges with other L o n d o n
colleges, notably our own, last
year and this year, with Kings
College and Chelsea College.
Bedford is another smaller
L o n d o n college which faces
closure unless they can complete
a deal within the University of
London to split itself amongst
several other colleges.
Full cost fees for overseas
students is yet another conten-
tious issue. Fewer students can
now afford to study in this
country if they come from
abroad. This restricts the foreign
students to those who have
government or industrial spon-
sorship plus the handful of
others who can afford to pay the
enormous fees bill.
For example it is now cheaper
for foreign students to study at
prestigious American institutes
such as the California Institute
of Technology, the Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology,
Berkley and others than for
them to come for example to
Imperial. While previously this
was not the case, we attracted a
large number of highly talented
students from abroad which in
turn strengthened the univer-
sities here. Now these students
will be looking elsewhere for
opportunities in higher educa-
tion and we will loose a valuable
contribution to the academic
world. This has wider implica-
tions in the industrial sector. A
large p r o p o r t i o n of foreign
students c o m i n g f r o m the
developing countries to univer-
sities in both A m e r i c a and
Britain go back to their home
countries to take up, or very
likely end up i n , important
government advisory positoins
or highly placed in industry.
Trends indicate clearly that
those ex-students will be strongly
biased towards placing any
industrial or equipment orders
with firms in the country in
which they studied. Hence by
l o o s i n g a large number of
foreign students we will in the
long term be adversely affecting
our export market to these
developing countries.
Losing foreign students has
other repercussions such as on
the School of Hygiene and
T r o p i c a l M e d i c i n e and the
Postgraduate Medical School,
both of which take a very high
proportion of foriegn students
each year.
Cuts in the secondary educa-
tion system have been as severe
as in higher education. Schools
are h a v i n g to o p e r a t e o n
shoestring budgets, with fewer
teaching staff hence higher pupil
teacher ratios, and almost no
money for renewing antiquated
equipment.
W h i l e m a n d a t o r y grants
remain conditional on the offer
of a university place, dis-
cretionary grants for courses
such as physiotherapy, and
speech therapy are becoming
more difficult to obtain.
And of course there is the
hardship of redundancies as
institutions are trimmed or
closed, still further increasing
the number out of work.
I have tried to outline the
p r o b l e m s the E d u c a t i o n a l
Alliance is trying to combat by
insisting on a halt to the
decimation of our education
system, brought about in this ill-
conceived and haphazard fa-
shion. The rally on Wednesday
is important, probably the most
important this year. While it
may all seem a little strange to
some of the freshers, it is above
all to them to whom this article
is addressed. The Alliance needs
your support'and above all your
participation. It really is in your
hands, for decisions on policy
taken this year may have far
reaching, long term effects. I will
be at the rally on Wednesday
and I very much hope that you
will make every effort to be there
as well.

At last Friday is here and the
weekend l o o m s , h o p e f u l l y
everyone got through the first
week without too many hassles,
(a great institution—the British
queue!).
This short article is really an
introduction on how to complain
at Imperial College. You may be
living in College accommoda-
tion. If you have any complaints
b e y o n d / o t h e r than those of
c l e a n i n g / c o o k i n g facilities
which can be dealt with by the
Warden, send a letter to Mr
John Lauwerys. He is an assis-
tant to J o h n S m i t h and is
currently doing an in depth
study of College accommoda-
tion and is interrogating inter-
ested parties in College. This is
your chance to be included in his
report which will be published at
Christmas.
Refectories
This especially concerns the two
newer outlets: the J C R Buttery
and the new Union Lounge Bar.
If the food is still execrable I
want you to write to me and tell
me why. Changes can only be
forced if there is sufficient
feedback. Any business concern-
ing the bars can be brought to
me because I am Chairman of
the College Bar Committee.
Courses
The other area you will probably
(and ought) to have fresh ideas
about are academic affairs. Here
we have a very good representa-
tional structure and the best
person to contact is your C C U
Academic Affairs Officer.
If you are unsure at any stage
write to or phone me at the
Union Office and we can proceed
from there.
Educational Alliance
It used to be the case that part of
every student's life was partici-
pation in rallies. Alas, those
days are over but I still hope you
have a genuine concern over the
educational strategy in this
country. Please make every
effort to attend the Rally on the
13th.
See you there.
