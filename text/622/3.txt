Welsh Letter
Imperial College U n i o n has
received a communication in
Welsh from the students union
of the University of Aberystwyth.
The letter (fortunately with a
translation enclosed) informed
him that the A b e r y s t w y t h
Students' Union is considering
disaffiliating from the National
Union of Students. As IC is one
of the few colleges outside Scot-
land not to be connected with
the NUS, they are seeking advice
and encouragement.
Stephen Goulder, I C U Presi-
dent, said that he was flattered
by their enquiry and would reply
as soon as he had mastered the
language.
Balancing
the Books
Students could soon be charged
for use of the Science Museum
L i b r a r y in Imperial College
Road. This follows a recommen-
dation in the Rayner Report on
rationalisation of the civil service.
At present the library is open
to all postgraduate students and
research assistants, and in some
cases to t h i r d year u n d e r -
graduates. A levy of thirty pence
on each book issued is now
planned and there could be a
reduction in the number of
periodicals kept in stock.
U n i o n P r e s i d e n t Steve
Goulder and External Affairs
O f f i c e r S i m o n R o d a n have
officially protested that they
were not notified of the planned
changes, w h i c h are t o t a l l y
unacceptable to the Union. M r
Goulder described the plans as
an act of gross ingratitude on the
part of the library, which already
has all rent, heating and lighting
paid by the College.
The Rag Tiddlywinks stunt has
been p o s t p o n e d until next
Saturday because of possible
police intervention over licensing
laws.
Traditionally, IC students
have always tiddlywinked along
O x f o r d Street on the first
Saturday of term; this has
always been considered the
Freshers' Rag Stunt. But after
last year's controversy over
street collecting licenses, Scot-
land Yard informed the Union
that if they went ahead on
Saturday they would be prose-
cuted, despite the M u l t i p l e
Scelerosis Society withdrawing
their complaint after the Rag
Committee had offered to collect
for MS funds.
Several attempts to find a way
around the law were made, but
all of them failed. The most
o r i g i n a l of these was that
tiddlywinking down O x f o r d
Street had been done since 1968,
and was therefore a folk tradition
and exempt from the regulations.
The Metropolitan Police wrote
back enclosing a copy of the
Miscellaneous Provisions Act of
1916 (section 5, regulation 3(1),
schedule 2) which imposes a
minimum precedent of thirty
years on folk traditions.
At a meeting of the Union
Executive last week, it was
decided to proceed in defiance of
the police, but along Kings Road
to avoid the waiting constabulary
in Oxford Street. King's Road is
London's second busiest shop-
ping street and, a collection in
excess of £1,000 for charity was
expected. B u t at a f u r t h e r
meeting on Wednesday, it was
revealed that M e n c a p (the
society for the mentally handi-
capped) had licences which
would allow the Union to collect
for them on the f o l l o w i n g
Saturday, and so the committee
agreed that under the circum-
stances it would be wiser to
postpone the event until Saturday
week.
As an alternative Rag stunt
for tomorrow, the R C S U will be
selling Rag Mags at the Univer-
sity of Kent in C a n t e r b u r y ,
leaving Beit Arch at 9:30am.
All Work
and
No Play
Students in the department of
Management Science have been
prevented from attending intro-
ductory events organised by the
College and Union. The depart-
ment have organised formal
classes for the first Moniiay and
Tuesday of term and, there are
also classes timetabled for
Wednesday afternoon which clash
with sports club trials.
This action was taken despite
an agreement between the Board
of Studies and the Union that no
classes be organised for the first
Monday and Tuesday of term
and that Wednesday afternoons
should be left free for students to
participate in the sports and
recreational clubs.
The head of the Management
Science department, Professor
Eilon refused to comment and
suggested that a n y queries
involving timetabling should be
addressed to the College Regis-
trar.
New Refectory — Whining and Dining
FELIXI
Simon Perry, Refectory Committee Chairman Bob Schroter, and
Deputy Catering Manager Martin Parsons agree there are too few
chairs (or too many tables) in the new refectory.

The new U n i o n Lounge bar
opened on Monday to a varied
reception from staff and students
alike.
As foreseen, there have been
some teething problems. Refec-
tory staff have complained that
the kitchens are excessively hot
and students have complained
that the food is not. Other
complaints have mostly con-
cerned quality of the hot meals,
which seems to have deteriorated
since M o n d a y ; the procedure of
cooking food in the Sherfield
Refectory and re-heating it in the
new kitchens does not appear to
work.
The salads and ploughman's
lunches have p r o v e d most
p o p u l a r , a n d a p p r o a c h the
standards of those served in the
Royal College of Art refectory,
while being rather cheaper. The
rolls from behind the bar are still
generally all sold by 1:30pm.
Refectory Committee Chair-
man D r Bob Schroter's initial
reaction was very favourable.
The fittings and decor have been
criticised because the rooms
looks as if building was finished
in a hurry, which it was. The
bare painted walls need posters
or other decoration, and there is
no clock. In general the new
service is acceptable but not
i spectacular.
