RCS Freshers' UGM erupts into acrimonious debate
over 'sexist' beauty c o n t e s t as B o b b y Joe Stein is
proclaimed as
A RIGHT-DOWN REGULAR ROYALQUEEN!
A fourteen stone male chemist was elected Queen of Jez at the Royal
College of Science U G M on Monday. This followed a narrowly
defeated motion to abolish the post as 'sexist and deliberately
uninteresting'.
Bobby Joe Stein: T think it's most
unfair.'
The motion was proposed by
the glamorous Philip Nathan,
who in an eloquent speech
denounced the competition,
asserting that it actively dis-
courages women from entering
science and t e c h n o l o g y in
general and the RCS in parti-
cular. Voting was close enough
for a recount to be necessary; the
motion was finally defeated by
twenty votes" over two hundred.
Six candidates then stood for
the post; four girls, D a v e
Watson (who stood to prove
that the election was not sexist)
and Bobby Jo Stein (who stood
to prove that it was). Mr Stein
(in a gas mask) was duly re-
turned to the post. His duties
will involve accompanying Jez
on all Rag stunts and adding
glamour to RCS functions.
A s part of his prize, he
receives a half-ticket for the
Silwood Ball(which half?) and
traditionally RCS President Karl
Schmidt must take him out to
dinner—but Mr Schmidt hopes
that this t r a d i t i o n can be
ntinued.
Phil Nathan: 'I wouldn't want to be
stuck up as a sex symbol on Jez'.
Back in
the Lion's
Den
Reggie, the Scwt six foot long
concrete lion was formally
presented to Kings College
London by the Royal College of
Science U n i o n on Tuesday
afternoon.
The Kings College Students'
Union mascot was stolen last
February during a spate of
successful RCS mascotry raids.
Two weeks later, a team from
City and Guilds rescued him for
their own purposes. After
several months of n o n - c o -
operation Kings admitted that
they would like Reggie back, and
a ransom of a hundred pints of
blood for the Blood Transfusion
service, a £40 donation to IC
Rag and a second donation to an
undisclosed charity was negoti-
ated. The exchange was arrang-
ed for Tuesday, after the City
and G u i l d s U G M at which
Reggie was spirited away by the
RCS. Karl Schmidt, President of
RCS, informed Kings that the
hand over would go ahead as
arranged, but with the R C S
claiming the glory.

Frying
Tonight
Residents of Montpelier Hall
failed to notice a fire in a
neighbouring shop last Sunday,
assuming that the smoke and
smells of burning were from their
barbecue.
Last Sunday the postgraduate
residents of Montpelier Hall
were invited to a welcoming
barbecue in their garden. The
queueing for food began early
and people on the upper floors,
enticed into the garden by the
smell of smoke, were surprised
to find that only raw sausages,
burgers and kebabs awaited
them.
Later, while the food was
being cooked the cause of the
earlier delicious, smoky smell
was ascertained—the Knights-
bridge Pavilion of Antiques was
quietly burning a short distance
away on the Brompton Road.
The evening proceeded to the
sound of Montpelierites obli-
viously chinking glasses and
firemen breaking glass with
their hatchets.
It was not until the barbecue
was well under way that all the
students realised the scale of the
emergency.
A l a n S w a n n
Dr Alan Swann, who qualified
four years ago at the University
of Southampton, comes to take
up some of Tony Haines' duties
at the Health Centre. He will be
lending a particularly knowing
and confidential ear to the
emotional, sexual and medical
problems of the students. A
display of contraceptives is
already up in the waiting room,
a n d f u r t h e r m o r e he p l a n s
education in preventive medicine
and first aid.
