A Fair Fight
There was an angry scene at
F r e s h e r s ' F a i r on T u e s d a y
when the Jewish and Islamic
Societies found themselves
o c c u p y i n g adjacent stalls,
following a reshuffle.
The mix-up was caused when
Robin G r a h a m , chairman of
both Vegetarian and Jewish
societies, suggested that the two
stalls change places so that
Vegsoc would have access to an
electric socket.
Neither society was deterred
f r o m d i s p l a y i n g s t r o n g l y
political posters, and Social
Clubs Committee Chairman
Jonathan Miller was called in
to arbitrate in the ensuing
shouting match. A s an ex-
chairman of Jewish Society
himself, this was impossible,
and Union officials were forced
to remove posters from both
stalls before peace was restored.
U n i o n President Stephen
Goulder criticised both societies
for their conduct and claimed
that religious societies should
not display political posters,
but that p u t t i n g the two
societies in the same room at
all was in retrospect rather
foolish. Fencing club at Fresher's Fair.

PINCCCMI Coming Soon
General Reisenschein's army is on the march,
and he is basing his new HQ in Khan Tsimi.
There is a square room available for the offices
of General Reisenschein and his four chiefs of
staff, the heads of the Secret Service
(Heidensieck), the army (Gunter Schutzem),
the navy (Admired Zinkorschwimm), and the
air force (Di Van Zoom). The General has
already commandeered a right-angled
isosceles triangle (see diagram) and, to save
arguments, the four chiefs of staff are to have
the same size and shape offices, each with a
continuous perimeter. Can you help them
achieve this dissection?
