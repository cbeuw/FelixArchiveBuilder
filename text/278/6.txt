I saw a film the other
day which lasted four hours
— excluding intermission —
which had zero script and
a minimum of chrono-
logical order. Now, the only
place in London which is
assured an audience for such
a film is the National Film
Theatre but the point of
criticising it is that it is
shortly to be given an "ex-
perimental" run on a more
commercial basis. Thus I
thought it humane to give
the guinea pigs an inkling of
what they're in for.
It's a French film — no
one in this country or
America would have the
nerve to try this one on the
public. It's called "Mad
Love" (L'Amour Fou) and
<
t could be said that its
commercial appeal ends
with the title. Jacques
Rivette, the director, knows
all about c o n t r o v e r s y
through the previous film
"Paris, Nous Appartient".
In Paris they're still arguing
about the film's commercial
viability and Rivette him-
self walks the slender line
between genius and madness.
What has been attempted
in "L'Amour Fou" is ob-
vious enough. Someone has
simply set out to make a
film which follows the break-
down of a marriage. That's
so simple to have been done
countless times before. This
fact has obviously forced
Rivette to find a new setting,
a different light for an age-
old story. He does it by
mingling fact, pure fact,
with fiction — but his fic-
tion is by no means pure,
because the actors, unres-
tricted by a script or pre-
conceived ideas, are giving
vent to their emotions and
torments just as they would
if faced by reality.
Sebastian and Claire are
a young married couple. He
is a play producer who is
working on a production of
Racine's "Andromaque" —
she plays Andromaque and
is being upset by the con-
stant intrusion of TV
cameras which are following
the development of the pro-
duction for a documentary
on the difficult rehearsals.
Fair enough. But Jean-Pierre
Kalfou, who plays Sebastian
is a producer and way re-
hearsing the play for a for-
mal performance. Also,
French T V did film him at
work. In fact the only con-
trived thing about the whole
of Rivette's film is the re-
lationship of Sebastian and
Claire and in the light of the
complete authenticity of the
rest of the film one wonders
just how contrived that was!
The effect on the audience is
certainly disorientating. The

Yossarian is the main
character.
The book begins with him
and ends with him, and
around him revolve all the
other characters; Generals,
Majors, pilots, whores and
all the other strange people
who make up the cast of one
of the most extraordinary
books to have been written
in the past few decades.
But Yossarian is not the
character the book is about,
he is the readers' guide
through the maze of human
relationships woven by
Joseph Heller in CATCH
22, reissued by Corgi Books
at 7/-.
Briefly, the plot concerns
an American airforce divi-
sion based on the island of
Pianosa, a few miles from
the Italian coast. The pilots
there are required to com-
plete a certain number of
missions before being al-
lowed to return to America.
As soon as they complete
these missions, the number is
raised by the Colonel in
charge, and they have to fly
another five or ten missions.
And so it goes on. Slowly
the number of pilots de-
creases, and the number of
missions rises.
Most of the action takes
place at the camp on
Pianosa (where Yossarian
shares a tent with a dead
man called Mudd) but the
scene Changes periodically
to Rome, the Eternal city,
where the pilots go on leave,
and the book contains a
description of the Italian
capital which must be one of
the most compelling pieces
of writing ever produced.
It is difficult to explain
the exact meaning of the
title since it seems open to
as many interpretations as
there are characters; but an
example of its application
gives its general meaning:
Orr is one of Yossarian's
friends. Orr is mad, he must
be mad to go on so many
missions and always crash-
land in the sea on the return
to Pianosa. Obviously, if he
is mad he can be sent home,
away from the war, the
escape all the pilots crave
for. All he has to do is sign
a form for the camp psy-
chiatrist and he would be
free. But if he is able to fill in
a form, how can he be mad?
So if he fills the form in, he
cannot be certified insane,
and if he does not, well, he
is insane but will not be sent
home. That's the catch.
Catch 22. Just how Orr
circumvents the problem is
a story in itself, but it seems
to be preferable to be crazy
if you are forced to live in
a crazy society, as all the
supposedly sane characters
discover.
The story does not follow
any set chronological order,
but moves back and forth as
each character is described
in detail, from Milo Minder-
binder, who is engaged in
trying to sell chocolate
covered cotton to the troops,
and occasionally bombs his
own airfield, to a fourteen-
year-old Italian girl who is
intent on Yossarian's death.
It is intensely funny on the
surface, but behind the
intricate web of dialogue and
description, there lies some-
thing important. CATCH 22
is about people, all the un-
believable characters are as
human and three-dimen-
sional as any living person;
it is about how a society
can try to control an in-
dividual if the individual is
not careful to avoid it. The
new cover shows a man
staring belligerently at the
reader; the previous cover
contained a silhouette of a
man shouting his defiance at
everything.
But the book, as I said,
is not strictly about Yos-
sarian; it is about a charac-
ter who is dead before the
story opens, a gunner, Snow-
den. When Yossarian finds
Snowden on the floor of the
rear gun-turret, yOu find
what the book is really
about.
Read it.
cameras in front of the
movie cameras give you the
impression that this film was
made almost by someone,
yourself, simply looking at
the action.
The pace is naturally un-
hurried, even sluggish — but
much of life is that way any-
how and it gives the direc-
tor the opportunity to ex-
plore the very plexus of life
and love in great detail. But
above all the format gets
you involved by the sheer
physical weight of the film's
length and, just as most
people would get to know a
person pretty well after four
hours of one sided conversa-
tion, so the characters of
"L'Amour Fou" prise them-
selves into your sentiments
by brute force alone.
There are lots of other
tricks to throw you off
balance. The domestic
scenes between Claire and
Sebastian which, throughout
the film, span the whole
vista of human emotions
from passion, through in-
sanity and suicide, to mur-
der itself, are filmed in
crisply textured 35 mm film.
The play scenes are shot in
16 mm and then blown up
for 35 mm projection. The
result is to give half the film
a muzzy, detached quality
which, by its almost para-
normal texture lends fiction
to the reality which is before
the camera. Conversely, the
sharply defined 35 mm parts
appear only too real whilst
being the only contrived part
of the film.
Having said that you'll
wonder what's wrong. A l l I
can say is, if anyone goes to
see this film they would be
well advised firstly, to read
"Andromaque", and second-
ly, to speak French. At the
NFT the sound came via an
interpreter over earphones—
the gentleman sounding a
Utile blotto and managing
to translate about a quarter
of the dialogue. This was
only because the proper
soundtrack for the film is on
tape which had not arrived
from Paris. The public might
just get the real thing. It's
sad also that any film re-
quiries a little work from
the audience, but the work
here is so inextricably tied
to Racine's "Andromaque"
that ignorance of that parti-
cular play, and it was my
misfortune to have been and
to remain so, certainly takes
some of the essence away.
However, for its originality
of conception "L'Amour
Fou" is a very great film
indeed and I for one shall
be fascinated to see how the
public take it — especially
with a decent soundtrack.
