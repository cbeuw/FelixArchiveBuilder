IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION No. 278 22nd MAY, 1969 6d
M.P.s Quiz College
By our Special Correspondent, Piers Corbyn
The visit of the parlia-
mentary committee on stu-
dent relations was poorly
publicised and poorly atten-
ded — quite a few students
knew Wednesday was the
day but had no correct
knowledge of the timetable.
At 10 a.m. six students
were publicly questioned by
six M.P's. in Mech. Eng.
220. Audience participation
was not allowed (old fash-
ioned bureaucrats used the
excuse of parliamentary pri-
vileges). Discussions centred
round a two page report
presented by the six students.
The sole left representative,
Dave Christopher, presented
a document of about the
same length with an appen-
dix of about five times the
length (available from the
Polcoun library), using much
material from FELIX.

Participation'
Questions covered many
subjects so in the 1£ hours
discussion in depth was im-
possible. The M.P's. were
surprised I.C. was not in the
NUS. The USK was wel-
comed as the beginning (or
so it would have appeared
to the M.P's.) of I.C's. prob-
ing into the great big out-
side. Rakesh Mohan out-
lined the overwhelming de-
mand for ' non technical
studies' (not necessarily
management studies). Dis-
satisfaction was expressed at
the ' participation' offered
at I.C. Although we have
representation it seems that
the student voice is only
needed if the authorities
agree; the student 'partici-
pation ' role in I.C. is at pre-
sent not much more than one
of suggesting ideas for the
authorities to implement or
not — the direction of events
being beyond student influ-
ence, students representation
on the Board of studies,
Finance and Executive Com-
mittee and Governing Body
could help. Student unrest
was probed(!) — various
replys resulting. Dave Chris-
topher gave (to applause) a
long 'speech' on ' aliena-
tion ' (from the whole of
society) of which student
unrest is only a facet.
The Staff interviewed after
the students, presented a
confused picture — probably
in more disarray than the
students! Sinclair Goodland
stated that they had been
' selected by mysterious pro-
cesses '. Their main discus-
sion began on the purpose
of I.C's. education. Some of
the M.P's. feeling that Art-
icle 2 of the Charter of
Incorporation (centre of ex-
cellence) was a bit narrow.
In the ensuing discussion
Prof. Ford (Mech. Eng. head
of dept.) proudly claimed
that non-technjcal studies
had been going on in his
department for 20 years.
Prof. Coles and others poin-
ted out that studying Econo-
mics and Management Stu-
dies (presumably in order to
make industry more efficient)
was a little different from
joining into ' the total intel-
lectual activity of man'. A
Prof, from the Maths. De-
partment claimed (to audi-
ence derision) that in the
Maths, department super-
specialization was necessary
to maintain I.C's. status as
a place which annually pro-
duced 15 brilliant mathema-
ticians. Prof. Ford, despite
his proud claim of ' broad
courses ', said that this coun-
try needed ' centres of
excellence'.
The M.P's. suggested that
once I.C. had been three
institutions — why not make
it into a broader college of
5 or 6 or 7 — incorporate it
with the nearby colleges?
The perennial question of
failure rates arose and flitted
away before the glare of sus-
picious faces.
The ' Authorities' were
not as coherent on the prob-
lems of I.C. as the M.P's.
were in questioning them.
They confirmed that the
Finance and Executive com-
mittee was the power house
and gave a nice picture of
JURGO. Student houses and
staff - student committees
were presented as examples
of where co-operation has
worked well.
Student Unrest
Lord Penney, on student
unrest, felt that it was conta-
gious and something to do
with society at large — not
just universities. He ended
his comment on it amidst
loud cheers ' these are all
problems I don't really
understand'. The Rector
said he disagreed with the
student view that their repre-
sentatives should be ' mand-
atable' and believed like
other members of ' the
authorities' that the college
should avoid these ' pyramid
like methods of industry'
(presumably because they
sharpen frustration).
The discussion afterwards
(not recorded by the M.P's.
who mostly went back to
Parliament) uncovered glos-
sed-over grievances and
ideas — lucidly expounded
by Harry Fairbrother, many
of the students, Dr. Steven
Rose and others. People
who spoke on the subject
mostly stated (with exam-
ples) that feedback only
worked well when it was in
the interests of the authori-
ties that it should.
The real purpose of the
committee is, it seems, to
find ways of curbing student
unrest. Student unrest is only
a facet of the unrest of
society—if not the world . . .
What recommendation will
the Committee make?
Prince Philip
scores a hit
The RCSU social event of
the decade passed smoothly
on Wednesday evening, May
14th, to the general acclaim
of the Union, Press and
BBC. Prince Philip came to
dinner, made a witty speech,
lingered in South-side Bar
and slipped off home just
before eleven o'clock.
On his arrival the Duke of
Edinburgh was welcomed by
a reception party of about
20 Union officials and their
ladies. Balding, but impres-
sive in stature he joked with
the lads before being led to
his place as guest of honour
by RCS President Gwyn
Hughes. Ranged along the
top table were an impressive
group of department heads,
Lords Penney and Sherfield
and their wives. The spaces
were filled by Union offi-
cials, including Pam Hor-
rocks deep in conversation
with the Rector on the intri-
cacies of cricket.
Considering the mass of
guests, over 350, Mooney
surprised all by the excel-
lence of his cooking, al-
though the wine was criti-
cised. The main course was
escalope of Veal Concalaise
accompanied by Chateau
Brane Cantenac 1962. It was
during this that Piers
(CEFE) Corbyn enlivened
proceedings by presenting
the Prince with a balloon.
There was also a number of
more vital happenings as a
surprising number of guests
left their seats to the usual
accompaniment only to slink
back later. These events were
later commented on by the
Presidents of Mines and
Guilds.
Prince Philip opened wit-
tily his speech to toast
RCSU, and thanked RCS
for his welcome, which, he
said, had surprised him see-
ing how many of the officers
were Welsh. To loud cheers
he refused to comment on
Universities as he was one
of those ' ignorant bums who
never went to one'. After a
brief discourse on our crazy
world and its problems he
ended with two words for
RCS members on their
Union: ' use it'.
In his reply Gwyn Hughes
showed a slight touch of
nerves as he fumbled with
his notes but after this shaky
start he produced a surpris-
ingly good speech which
q u o t e d extensively from
FELIX. C h r i s Yewlett,
RCSU Secretary, proposed
the toast to the guests in a
befitting manner, mercifully
free of his usual puns. The
response to this toast was
made by Lord Sherfield, the
Chairman of the Governors
who also entered into the
spirit of the occasion, putting
his glasses on and taking
them off to emphasise his
points. There was some
laughter when it seemed
that Lord Sherfield was sug-
gesting he didn't have
enough girls but it now
appears he was suggesting
RCS was short of girls, and
a small walkout over a short
passage interpreted as criti-
cal of ASTMS.
After the dinner H.R.H. met
guests in the South-side bar,
lingering over Stan's beer
until just before eleven when
RCS's distinguished guest
slipped off home still joking
merrily.
Chain Reaction
To force a speedy settle-
ment of the technicians' dis-
pute, the ASTMS at univer-
sities throughout the coun-
try have withdrawn the
labour of key technical staff.
There is widespread sym-
pathy for the wage-claim
from university administra-
tions, and many of these,
including I.C., are now urg-
ing the Department of Edu-
cation and Science to settle
the dispute nationally. At
I . C . the Administration
agreed that the 28 key tech-
ncians, largely store-men, out
on strike should not be vic-
timised, nor should anyone
else do their work.
In opposition to the line
adopted by the Administra-
tion, the Biochemistry Stores
was opened at 11.30 a.m. on
Monday, 12th May. Within
fifteen minutes over a hun-
dred technicians gathered
outside the office of the
{Establishment Officer, and
a delegation was elected to
see him. The Stores was
closed on Tuesday and Wed-
nesday.
However, the Biochemis-
try Stores was re-opened on
Thursday morning, and all
sections of the department
were encouraged to use it.
The situation was discussed
at a general meeting of the
I.C. branch of ASTMS that
lunchtime. The meeting
decided that each time
action was taken t© break
the effectiveness of the key-
worker strike, the whole
membership of the I.C.
Branch would stop work for
two hours. The meeting also
decided that the first stop-
page had already been pro-
voked by the Biochemistry
Department, and thus a
demonstration was held out-
side that department from
two o'clock until four. Re-
presentatives were sent to
every Head of Department
to explain the reason for
their lack of technical staff,
and Professor Chain's super-
fluity of same.
From all over the college
there have been reports of
spontaneous reaction to
attempts to bypass the stores
which have been closed.
Many immediate walk-outs
have been threatened, and
materials coming directly
