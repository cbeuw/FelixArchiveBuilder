R.C.S. TRIUMPH ON SPORTS DAY
Yet another Cup fell to
the RCS sportsmen last
Saturday when they won
the Governors' Challenge
Shield for the Constituent
College Athletics match.
No Stars
The occasion was de-
tracted from somewhat by
the fact that the Fete was
on the same day and that
the star athletes were com-
peting for U L U in Paris.
Nevertheless, considerable
effort was put into the
afternoon by those 'athletes'
that did turn up and the
hardy band of officials who
seem to be there every
year.
There were few perfor-
mances of outstanding
merit, but the dual for over-
all superiority developed
into a nail-biting affair be-
tween RCS and C&G.
Eventually all hung on
the final event, the 4 x 400
metres relay. It was close
fought all the way, with RCS
eventually winning in 3 min.
49.7 sees, with C&G second
in 3 mins. 49.4 sees. — a
truly dramatic finish.
Deserving of a mention
are Pine (C&G) and Step-
henson (RCS) who tied for
the best individual total of
the afternoon with 26 points
each, Also Critchley of
C&G who, throwing the
javelin for the first time in
2 years, beat the rest of the
field by over 30 ft. throw-
ing about 170 ft.
Lilas Champion
RCS had the consolation
of winning the girls' com-
petition thanks mainly to
Lilas Campion who had the
distinction of winning all
the girl's events. They also
won the Tug-of-War out-
right.
Lady Penney presented
the cups to the somewhat
sparse applause of the few
spectators and athletes.
It is a shame that there
isn't more athletic and
spectator interest in the
College at present for
Sports Day since it is
potentially one of the most
enjoyable events of the year.
Tony Mason is to be con-
gratulated on what he did
manage to achieve as or-
ganiser under very trying
circumstances.

COURAGE NOT ENOUGH
On May 4th at 9.23 a.m.
6 people from Physics I at-
tempted to swim the
Channel. The team arrived
in Folkestone on Friday
evening and found that the
weather forcast prohibited
swimming on Saturday.
However, as is typical with
English weather (and it
seems any event connected
with this year's charity) the
depression moved and it
would have been a perfect
day to make the attempt.
The pilot took the team for
half and hour's swim and
the rest of the day was
spent relaxing,
At 5 a.m. on Sunday, the
eight strong contingent, to-
gether with two Channel
Swimming Association ob-
servers, boarded the boat.
Seasickness claimed the or-
ganiser of the swim and the
only crew member as vic-
tims shortly afterwards. The
boat anchored at Cap Gris-
Nez and the first swimmer
entered the water. The wea-
ther worsened, three to four
foot waves being whipped
up by the wind and after
four or five miles had been
covered one of the swimmers
collapsed in the water and
the swim had to be
abandoned.
The Vice Chairman of
the Channel Swimming As-
sociation said in a letter to
the Physics I rep: "It was
a grand scheme alright
— there is a world of
difference between the
comparative safety of your
London river and the deep,
dark and dangerous English
Channel, where a man in
the water is so alone and
all on the escort boat in
the snug comfort of their
track suits and sleeping
bags are his bitter enemies.
Magnificent
"To swim, without pro-
tective clothing, in a tem-
perature of 48 °F for one
hour is a feat in itself, but
if one can do this after 4—5
hours in a rolling boat, then
he can hold his head high
in any company of en-
durance swimmers". He
commended Pete Marwood,
the team's captain, who
"with a magnificent cap-
tain's effort set a splendid
example to the rest of his
team". Credit is due to the
other swimmers: John Be-
thell, Jeremy Bowler,
Richard Fisher, Pete Lon-
nen and Victor Steiner and
to the people who spent
time writing to firms about
sponsorship: Crista Gaus-
den, Subia Chatterjee,
Richard Gleave and Ed
Robins..
ACTION IN NOTTING HILL
Following the publication
of the interim report of the
Notting Hill Housing Ser-
vice on housing conditions,
a public meeting was held
at Lancaster Road Metho-
dist Church on Monday —
5th May. The survey from
which the report was taken
was part of the 1967 Not-
ting Hill Summer Project.
Overcrowding
Overcrowding is severe.
69% of the people (and
85% of children) live at a
density of greater than 1
person per room. This re-
presents more than 1800
families. 28% of the popula-
tion are statutorily over-
crowded, compared with a
figure of 6.3% for the whole
of the Royal Borough of
Kensington and Chelsea and
a national average of 1.6%.
The rents paids are com-
monly around £4, though
rents up to £9 are not un-
common. Tenants fall into
three categories: Those pay-
ing controlled rents because
they have been in residence
for 20 years or more and
who pay relatively low rents
for reasonable accommoda-
tion. However they are still
worse off than the national
average; secondly there are
the tenants in unfurnished
flats, who are protested by
the 1965 Rent Act and are
less well off than the con-
trolled tenants; lastly there
are the furnished tenants
who have little protection by
the law and even less from
the Kensington and Chelsea
Council. These are the re-
sidents new to the area who
do not know the rules and
do not know how to fight.
Because families are pre-
pared to pay rents of £3 or
more for any sort of roof
over their heads, to prevent
the break up of the family,
landlords find it profitable
to subdivide tenancies.
Where this happens, tenan-
cies are small, overcrowding
and the price per room is
greatest and value for money
is least.
George Clark, director of
the Notting Hill Housing
Service said that the Coun-
cil was clearly to blame for
the situation and that the
time had come for the com-
munity to take action. This
required a co-ordinated
effort on behalf of all the
groups in the area and not
the selfish separate of in-
dividuals or factions.
Challenge
He issued a challenge to
the Kensington and Chelsea
Council to start drastic ac-
tion to rescue families in
distress immediately. If this
were not done by January
1st. 1970, there would be
"a campaign of civil dis-
obedience such as the coun-
try had not seen."
This statement was
heckled by militants who
thought that such a cam-
paign should start imme-
diately.
Chris Holmes of the Not-
ting Hill Community Work-
shop made the point that
the Council had always
been delighted to shelve its
responsibilities onto volun-
tary bodies such as the Not-
ting Hill Housing Trust. He
criticised the idea brought
forward earlier of using
rent controls and tribunals
which would encourage
landlords to decrease the
stock of 'cheap' rented ac-
commodation by converting
it to luxury accommodation,
beyond the financial capabi-
lities of the present oc-
cupants. Compulsory powers
the erosion of the private
should be sought to prevent
tenant.
At I.C. many of us work
and live in the Royal
Borough of Kensington and
Chelsea. The Borough Coun-
cil has the worst record in
the country for disregard of
its poor applying a rent
subsidy of £60,000 com-
pared with Camden, in
many ways a similar
borough, whose rent sub-
sidy is £2m. Also 85% of
the Council members have
admitted in public inter-
view to supporting Enoch
Powell.
Fashionable
Those who live in Notting
Hill should consider the
effect of their tenancies.
Students are willing to pay
£16 or so for flats that a
family could afford less than
half that amount for. Land-
lords can get large increases
in their income as a result of
for even more profitable
letting in an area made ac-
ceptable or even fashionable
by middle class students.
The rest of us should con-
sider giving assistance to
the various organisations
tackling the problems, and
not only to those such as
the Housing Trust that
relieve the Council of their
responsibility. The people,
and especially those mar-
vellous children deserve to
be saved.
After many ups and
downs during last term the
Golf Club has finally man-
aged to find its way back
into Hendon G.C. Hendon
GC. have offered ICGA
membership but have im-
posed several conditions on
this membership; the deci-
sion whether or not to ac-
cept this offer must lie with
the Club members and will
be discussed at the A G M
of the Club, which will be
held in Committee Room C
on Friday, 23 May.
League Leaders
During this term the Club
has managed to play 3
matches against Portsmouth
College of Technology, Uni-
versity College and the Uni-
versity of Surrey, the results
of these matches being a
3-3 draw and 5-1 victories.
These results and the fairly
good record of the Club so
far mean that IC now head
the South East Universities
Golf League and since not
all the other Colleges will
be able to complete their
fixture lists the prospects
look quite bright.
The ULU Golf Champion-
ships took place on Tuesday
20th May and IC were
strongly represented with
two four-man teams.
