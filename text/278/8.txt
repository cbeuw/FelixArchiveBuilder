Two Contest Guilds Presidency
Despite the posters there
was a poor response at the
Guild's Hustings on Friday
lunchtime. Obviously the
demands of lunch and exam-
inations exerted a greater
pull on the enthusiasm of
most guildsmen. The pro-
ceedings were characterised
by the usual Guild's sound
effects, amidst a hail of chalk
and hooting car horns. After
the minutes had been read
there was a slight interrup-
tion when Dermott Corr
announced the presence of
a member of R.C.S. The cul-
prit was asked to sing a
verse of ' All things bright
and beautiful' or else. A
members of I.C.W.A. was
then seen to slip quietly out
of the front door to cries of
' knickers'.
Non-political
The remainder of the time
was spent with the proposal
speeches. Of the candidates
for president Stephen Bates
rose first to be proposed by
Dave Foster followed by
Bob Pine proposing Stuart
Simpson. Neither of the
speeches were particularly
inspiring although both pro-
posers gave an impressive list
of their candidates achieve-
ments.
When left to answer ques-
tions the candidates both
expressed their desire to see
Guild's Union as a social
and sporting body, not as a
political one. Stuart Simp-
son described himself as
being politically centre while
Stephen Bates regarded him-
self as being more right of
centre with a wish to steer
clear of political 'hang-ups'.
The remainder of the posts
were unopposed except for
the Vice-Presidency and the
Representative on Council.
Dave Matthew gave an
amusing speech for Dennis
Taylor presenting a pseudo-
pouff image while Frank
Coldwell proposing Steve
Buttling seemed bored with
the whole affair. Chris Lewis,
the only candidate in fancy
dress his countenance ob-
scured by dark glasses and
top hat, did not seem to
think much about anything
while Roger Phillips, the
second candidate for Rep.
on Council, estimated the
total Council grant at only
about four thousand pounds.
Femininity won through as
Mandy Jones proposed as
O.C. representative refused
to comment whether she felt
there was anything big in
front of her for the future.
Before the meeting closed
a motion was proposed that
all members of Guild's
should boycott the service of
the Queen's Arms. Since no-
one rose to oppose the
motion it was duly carried
and Dermott Corr is sending
a letter officially acknow-
ledging the decision. The
proceedings were then closed
with the traditional Boom-
alaka at a quarter past two.
Increase in Mooney
Prices Next Session
Ian Jarvis proposes
Chris Lewis at
Guilds' Hustings.
R.C.S.U. Fades Away
RCS Union faded away
until next year with an anti-
climatic Union meeting
last Thursday, May 15th, the
day after Prince Philip's
visit. With the major elec-
tions for President, Vice-
President and Secretary last
term only the lesser posts on
general committee remained
to be filled. Steve Cann,
Phys. I, was elected Assis-
tant Secretary unopposed
and the only major contests
were for Ents. committee
and Academic Affairs Offi-
cer. Graham McNeilly of
Maths was proposed by his
department rep. and, after
some c o n f u s i o n John
McAdam, Phys. II, by Les.
Ebdon. McNeilly's proposer
was largely inaudible but
Ebdon's speech, although
extempore, secured a large
N.U.S. AT I.C.
A London R e g i o n a l
N.U.S. Conference will be
held at I.C. on May 31st.
These conferences are held
twice a year, and represen-
tatives from most London
Colleges attend. Although
I.C. is not a member of
N.U.S., it sends delegates to
these meetings and I.C. stu-
dents who wish to attend
are welcome. Further details
will be posted on the notice
board.
majority for McAdam, this
year's chairman of Comm.
Soc. Les stressed McAdam's
activity in academic affairs
and interest in Council,
where the officer is RCSU
rep. Various reports were
read from Union officers
and Pete Dolwin proposed a
motion giving RCS Broad-
sheet a grant next year.
Thanks
Prior to the usual initia-
tion ceremonies of the new
President and his Vice, at
which the eggs thrown at
officials were auctioned for
Christian Aid, Les Ebdon
proposed a vote to the Pre-
sident and the President pro-
posed a vote of thanks to
his General Committee.
NEW MINIBUS
Another Ford Transit
minibus has been purchased
to replace the vehicle which
was written off last term. It
is available for hire, and
booking forms may be ob-
tained from the Union office.
The charges are the same
as those for the last vehicle
although there are more res-
trictions on drivers' experi-
ence.
Reforms Wrecked
E.G.M. to come ?
Two meetings of Imperial
College Union were held on
Tuesday, May 15th. The
first, the adjourned meeting
from last term, was quickly
closed and the second ended
after some twenty minutes in
p a n d e m o n i u m after a
quorum challenge. It is still
not known whether this
means that the popular con-
stitutional reforms voted for
by an overwhelming major-
ity at the last meeting will
all be lost. The meeting did,
however, elect Phil Poyser
onto Council as a floor rep.
Dave Wield proposed Poy-
ser, a Chem. P.G., pointing
to his considerable service
to the I.C. athletic, foreign
visits and political scene and
outlined his policies — more
Union control of finance and
P.G. involvement. Dermott
Corr proposed R i c h a r d
Olley, Metallurgy 3, saying
he was opposed to mud-
slinging, especially in Union
publications. On a paper
ballot Poyser romped home
by 144 votes to 89 with a
number of abstentions.
Before discussion started
on the constitutional reforms
John Andrews, Hon. Porno-
grapher of Mines, attempted
to move such discussion to
the end of the meeting, this
was heavily defeated, amid
jeering. Andrews then chal-
lenged the quorum and des-
pite loud protests the Union
was counted out, being about
30 short of the required 300.
Attempts are now being
made to call an E.G.M. for
this week (see Felicity) and
Piers Corbyn and others had
collected, by Friday, over the
necessary 130 signatures for
a motion declaring inquorate
meetings as non-meetings.
Apparently this is legally
acceptable. Informed circles
view the loss of the reforms
as a major defeat for the
centre and feel they are
bound to strengthen the call
by the left for more far-
reaching reforms.
At a recent Catering sub-
committee m e e t i n g the
accounts for the first nine
months of this session were
presented showing a deficit
of over £500 and an estima-
ted deficit of between £2000
and £3000 at the end of the
session. This loss has been
mainly attributed to a
decrease in takings at the
Easter conferences.
More Wages
Also, next session College
Block will open involving
more captial costs and more
wages. However, part of the
costs will be offset by the
Holland Club members who
will be using the Refectory
facilities next session.
3d. on meals
As a result of this, the
sub-committee recommended
to the Refectory committee
the following price increases:
7% on cafeteria service (3d.
per meal), 15% on waitress
service (6d. per meal). Inter-
nal functions, e.g. Hall din-
ner and Freshers' dinners
will increase by 10% and ex-
ternal functions by 20%.
The Refectory Committee
agreed to these increases and
that they should come into
being on August 1st.
Notting Hill
Appeal
Most people have, at some
time or other, heard of the
needs of those who live in
the districts of Notting Hill
and North Kensington. Des-
pite all complaints it re-
mains a fact that perhaps
the greatest harm and dis-
appointment is brought to
the many thousands of chil-
dren who live in these dis-
tricts. One of the greatest
needs is for a safe and con-
structive place to play. Most
of the Children do not have
the sophisticated toys which
most middle-class children
expect. The large majority
are left to play in the streets
at the mercy of the London
traffic.
To counteract this need
various bodies are asking
for volunteers to help pro-
duce play grounds and to
conduct play groups for
children. The money is there
so all is needed is the man-
power and women-power to
achieve the result.
It is not purely charity as
it is hoped that the volun-
teers will also gain from the
experience.
For six weeks from July
29th to 17th August Not-
ting Hill Social Council will
be asking for 120 volunteers.
Volunteers will be housed
locally, if necessary. It may
be necessary to bring sleep-
ing bags or air mattresses.
The cost will be a contribu-
tion towards food—in total
about four and a half
pounds.
For a two week period
from the 16th A u g u s t
through to the 29th August,
the Student Christian Move-
ment will be conducting a
similar programme at a cost
of thirty shillings. Sheets and
blankets may be needed if
students wish to live in. Tra-
velling expenses may be paid
for those travelling to and
from Notting Hill while on
the job.
If you wish to volunteer
contact Mick Braybrook,
Old Beit.
•A.S.T.M.S. dispute
(contd.)
from the Main Stores have
been declared black.
Short
Sympathetic
Discussions commenced on
Thursday, 15th May between
the Minister of Education
and the ASTMS. Edward
Short was reported to be
sympathetic towards the
technicians claim, and fur-
ther meetings are expected
to take place on Monday
17th or Tuesday 18th, so
look at Felicity for more
recent news.
Discipline
Impasse
As reported exclusively in
last week's FELIX the nego-
tiations over disciplinary
procedures are deadlocked
on the question of double
punishment. According to in-
formed FELIX sources the
working-party on the nego-
tiations are to report back
to JURGO this week, see
FELICITY for latest devel-
opments.
