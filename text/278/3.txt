IDEAS SHOVED UNDER BED
S a c k T h e E d i t o r
from Lord Penney KBE, FRS, Rector of Imperial College
Dear Editor,
In your editorial Comment on 8th May you say you intend to maintain FELIX as a
paper where all views can be expounded. I hope that this includes the Rector.
You comment on the proposed visit by a Parliamentary Select Committee and say that
the Rector was asked to provide a wide spread of opinion from staff, students and author-
ities. You use inflammatory language and assert that the President of the Union and the
Rector have fallen into the error of trying to preserve the good name of Imperial
College. You state that I submitted an uninspired list of respectable staff but gave no hint
of an "unorthodox protestor, staff or student"
A journalist who gets his facts wrong soon gets the sack. Let me say what the facts are.
The College was told by the Secretary of the Select Committee they would like to have
three sessions, one to meet students, one to meet staff and one to meet the authorities. They
would like a representative cross-section, about half a dozen in each session.
I asked the Secretary of the College to organise an election of four members of staff. This
was done—first the collection of nominations from staff on a personal notice to all members
of the permanent staff and then by written ballot, where there was a high poll. I also
invited the Imperial College branch of the Association of University Teachers to nomin-
ate two staff members. This they did. With regard to the student group, I told the
President of the Union what the Committee wanted and asked him to consult student
opinion in any way he thought best. In due course, some names were sent to me and
included as the College student team.
With regard to the Authorities, I discussed the matter at the Deans' Committee and we
made the choice, including a postgraduate student warden and the Chairman of the Govern-
ing Body as members of our team.
Yours truly,
William $ e n n t p
INEPTITUDE
Dear Sir,
In the last few days the
shortcomings of Imperial Col-
lege Union and its leadership
have been well demonstrated
on two occasions. On Tues-
day, a small group of dedi-
cated reactionaries destroyed
the work of many and
the interest of more by
killing the Constitutional Re-
form motion at the Union
meeting. If Messrs. Andrews,
Mackman, and co. really
believe that the motion
should not be discussed at an
inquorate meeting, why didn't
they make efforts to get
people to the meeting by
publicising it, as their op-
ponents did? One can only
conclude that they are afraid
of having to discuss the
proposals and must resort to
the lowest and most negative
means at their disposal.
On Wednesday, those con-
cerned enough to attend the
meeting of the Parliamentary
Sub-Committee were frust-
rated at having to watch in
silence as our "represent-
atives" struggled to express
themselves. The ineptitude
was amply demonstrated
when Rex Lowin, doing most
of the talking, found himself
in many cases having to
defend a position he did not
support, which surely exactly
demonstrated the need for
better representation before
that committee.
The Sub-committee con-
clusions must have been
based on (a) the incoherence
and lack of courtesy of the
students in not preparing
themselves properly (e.g. the
hopeless muddle Rex Lowin
got into when questioned on
Union discipline) and (b) a
general feeling of satisfaction
with and disinterest in
student-staff relations at this
college, due to a general in-
coherence on the part of the
students, over-generalising by
staff, and whitewashing by
Prof. Ford and the admin-
istration.
One can only hope that
next year will bring a more
interested student body and a
more efficient and, above all,
more representative Union
hierarchy.
Yours,
Bruce Henderson,
Mech. Eng. 3.

HUMANITIES
Dear Sir,
As, in all probability the
Physicist whom you mis-
quoted to produce the closing
remarks of your back page
article last Felix, all I can say
is that if you think the best
way to broaden you as a
human being is to sit at a
desk studying the humanities
for your degree, then you
have a lot more to learn
about life than I have.
Yours,
Peter J. Billam,

GARBLED
Dear Sir,
Felix (late news, May 8th)
hopelessly garbles U n i o n
Council's discussion on the
sea-going cruiser for the sail-
ing club. No fait accompli
occurred. The boat had not
already been ordered, and
Council voted in favour of
the project in the knowledge
that it could as easily be
vetoed. The report does
not state that the loan
will be repaid from the
usual hiring out charges, nor
does it mention the College
grant of £500. The net cost to
Union funds should be
around £500, about the same
as this year's subsidy to Felix.
Your's Truly,
K. E. Weale,
Hon. treasurer, I.C.U.
Dear Sir,
Some of your readers may
recall during last session
some mentions in FELIX of
a scheme proposed by Tizard
Hall Committee to make
available camp beds, so that
Hall residents could put up
guests in their rooms in rea-
sonable comfort (and leg-
ality) at a modest cost. A
letter detailing the argu-
ments in favour of this
scheme was sent round to all
Hall Committees, a f t e r
which the proposal was ap-
proved by the Halls of Resi-
dence Representatives Com-
mittee (consisting of students
reps, from each Hall com-
mittee) with the proviso that
it should be tried as an
experiment by one Hall first
(the Warden and House-
keeper of Tizard were willing
to co-operate in this). It then
WASTE
Dear Sir,
Since the last Union meet-
ing was rather prematurely
adjourned, I would like to
suggest a motion to the
general mass of the student
body through your columns,
which I otherwise would
have proposed at the meet-
ing.
Council has chosen to ig-
nore the minority report on
the President's Dinner and
Dance and a Union meeting
could not discuss it. In my
view, this report did not go
far enough either. The cen-
tral issue is the colossal waste
of £400 spent on this extran-
eous occasion; the facts that
people want to wear dinner
jackets or other Zombie kits
is entirely irrelevant. Usually
this £400 comes out of the
Ents profits throughout the
year. Why should this money
not go to the Carnival char-
ity? Particularly this year
while we profess concern
over the plight of unmarried
mothers,, our President writes
to 'The Times' complaining
about people's uncharitable
attitude towards this unfor-
tunate set of our society, all
we do is to raise about £1000
by walking 27 miles on a
cold damp night and then
virtually pass the money over
to affluent pop-groups. Not
only is this situation scandal-
ous it is immoral in the
extreme.
The least we can do now
is to hand over the £400 to
be spent on the President's
D & D to the NCUMC.
The Union bureaucrats
can have their little (or big)
'do' if they want to but they
must pay for it. I don't care
if the top table get cigars
and champagne—or hashish
for that matter if they want
it—but I do object to Union
money being spent in this
way.
I appeal to everyone to
write in to the President of
the Union and demand that
this £400 be given to the
NCUMC.
Yours faithfully,
Rakesh Mohan.
went to the Student Residence
Committee (Rector, Senior
Warden, all Hall wardens
and only three students)
which by all accounts was
less than receptive to the
plan. However a sub-commit-
tee was set up under the
chairmanship of Mr. Stephen-
son, the Senior Warden,
which, judging from its
report, seems to have had
more interest in preserving
the status quo than taking
the suggestion seriously. Cop-
ies of the original letter to
Hall Committees were made
available, despite which the
principal reason advanced
for the rejection of the idea
had already been at least
partially refuted in it.
In retrospect, the reasons
why this particular proposal
looks at present to be lost
can be traced directly to in-
adequate student representa-
tion on the Student Resi-
dence Committee. By going
through the accepted chan-
nels the fate of it has been
left to two Halls reps., one of
whom was lukewarm to the
idea and one opposed to it.
It seems to us that this
case presents a strong argu-
ment for greatly increased
student representation from
the residents on the Student
Residence Committee (if
there is one warden per Hall
on it, why not one student
per Hall as well?).
Finally, since the rules
only disallow unauthorised
guests there is no reason why
Tizard or any other Hall
should not run the scheme
on its own, the Warden au-
thorising those who made use
of the beds. Originally it was
decided that the proposal
represented such a great de-
parture from accepted prac-
tice it should be put to the
Student Residence Commit-
tee first. After the superficial
way in which this body has
dealt with it we are not so
sure.

ELECTRICITY WAS
Sir,
NEVER FREE
In reply to Mr. Giles' letter of 8th May, the Bernard
Sunley House Committee would like to make the following
points:
1) We agree that nobody likes to be presented with an
electricity bill, but electricity has never been free. Many
amounts removed from meters in single rooms were over £6
for the term, so £8 does not seem in excess for an un-
metered electric fire. A l l complaints about the electricity
bills were heard, and six bills were either withdrawn or
reduced.
Residents have not been told that the house is running
into financial difficulties. No permanent "enlargements" were
thought of, never mind suggested, and there is no overcrowd-
ing in the house.
2) The House Committee, which includes the Warden and
Sub-Wardens, has always been prepared to answer questions
about the running of the house, yet Mr. Giles approached
none of us to check any of his so-called facts.
As a house Committee we expect criticism and welcome
it provided that it is accurate and constructive. That of Mr.
Giles was neither—he did not check any of his facts, merely
reported hearsay.
3) Finally we would like to point out that Student Houses
are a new venture and some difficulties to to be expected, but
these can be overcome with the co-operation of all con-
cerned.
Yours sincerely,
K. Ellis,
Secretary, Bernard Sunley House Committee.

NEXT FELIX
This will be the last
full Felix of the year.
The next spectacular
issue will appear on
Freshers' Day, under the
editorship of Malcolm
Williamson. Due to fin-
ancial difficulties, mainly
caused by a scarcity of
advertising and losses
from the Felix stands,
the last two issues have
been only eight pages
instead of the usual ten.
We hope that next year
we will be able to pro-
duce regular ten-page
issues throughout the
year, but this largely
depends on our not los-
ing too much by students
and others not paying
for their Felix.
Our readers are re-
minded that Felix now
costs sixpence and not
fourpence, as some of
our stands still adver-
tise.
H A V E Y O U PAID
FOR YOUR FELIX?
