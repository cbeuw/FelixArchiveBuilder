SB & Rent rebates
for Christmas
If you have to pay rent during the
vacation now is the time to start look-
ing at the alternative ways of meeting
this extra expense, which is not ac-
counted for in the student grant, nor
considered by the local education
.authorities as eligible for a discre
tionary vacation hardship grant,
except in very unusual circum-
stances. The fact is that LEAs have
reliquished their responsibilities in
this direction to other agencies that
provide financial assistance. Of
these the Department of Health and
Social Security (DHSS) gives the
most straightforward, and usually
the most substantial payments in the
form of Supplementary Benefit and
U n e m p l o y m e n t B e n e f i t . L o c a l
authorities operate the rent allow-
ance and rate rebate schemes,
which tend to be subject to local
variations, but more of these later.
Supplementary Benefit is avail-
able for people with a low income
whose financial commitments leave
them with an insufficient amount for
their everyday needs. For students
this would apply during the vacation,
when they are available for work. As
far as a student on a normal grant is
c o n c e r n e d the i n c o m e in the
vacation is assessed at £21.15pw.
This more or less equals the basic
living allowance of SB, so the two
tend to cancel each other out.
However, if you apply at the Office
for the area where you are paying
rent the additional expense of rent
will be met in part, or in total,
depending on your circumstances.
H o w S B is worked out If heating is
included in your rent, £5.10 will be
deducted from the amount eligible
for benefit, since this sum is included
in the basic SB Allowance already
balanced off by your grant. Also,
if your rent seems higher than
average the calculations may be
based on a rent more in line with
similar accommodation that has
been 'fair-rented'. Apart from this
the D H S S also sets a limit on the
maximum rent reimbursed which
varies in different areas. In the
Kensington/Fulham boroughs it is
£25 for single householders, £20 for
sharers, £26 for a flatlet and £31 for a
one-bedroomed flat.
As far as basic living allowances
payable are concerned these are
based upon your status, as deter-
mined by the D H S S , within a
household. The term householder
implies someone who is individually
r e s p o n s i b l e for all h o u s e h o l d
e x p e n s e s . H o w e v e r , it is not
precisely defined, so even if you are
running a separate household (own
room, own meters, etc.) a local
office may wrongly try to pay you at
the lower non-householder rate. The
way that S B is worked out for
sharers, or joint-householders, is to
classify them as non-householders
with a special addition equal to their
share of the difference between the
householder and the non-house-
holder scale rates. The current rates
1981/2 are: Householder's allowance
£23.25; Non-householder's allow-
ance £18.60; Sharer's allowance
£18.60 + (£4.65 divided by number of
sharers).
As an example take a flat of four
sharers paying £15 each. The basic
living expenses for one person will
be: £18.60 + 1.11 = £19.71 + rent at
£15 = £34.71.
From this sum £21.15 (vacation
grant) is deducted, leaving £13.56
payable as Supplementary Benefit.
H o w to apply for S B
1. Register as available for work on
the first weekday of the vacation at
your nearest Job Centre in the same
area as the one in which you are
paying rent. This benefit cannot be
back-dated nor can it be applied for
earlier than the first day that you are
officially available for work.
2. Assuming that there is no suitable
job available ask to be registered as
unemployed. You will be given a
card and form B l .
3. The card is taken to the unem-
ployment benefit office (often in the
same building as the Job Centre)
where you will receive instructions
about signing on regularly. This has
been relaxed considerably because
of the i n c r e a s i n g n u m b e r s of
unemployed.
4. Form B l is taken to the Supple-
mentary Benefit Office. An appoint-
ment system is normally in opera-
tion, so it may save time if you phone
them first. It will also save time if you
have the necessary documents with
you when you go to the SB Office to
be assessed. These are as follows: a
rent book/tenancy agreement/letter
from l a n d l o r d or the S t u d e n t
Services Office, if you are in College
accommodation, including proof
that you are resident at the address
stated, a recent bank statement, and
a students' unioncard or other proof
of identity, together with evidence of
any savings you may have.
The calculations of your SB will be
sent to you and if you disagree with
the assessment you are entitled to
appeal within twenty-one days.
And don't forget that anyone
receiving SB can automatically get
free N H S dental treatment, glasses
and prescriptions. So if you think
you might be needing any of them
ask for an exemption certificate
while you're at the D H S S Office.
Unemployment Benefit is avail-
able, during the vacations, for any
student who has paid C l a s s 1
National Insurance contributions on
earnings of at least £875 between
April 1978 and April 1979 or £976
between April 1979 and April 1980.
This will give a flat rate of £22.50
without any other complications. If
you have earnt more than the above
the earnings related supplement will
apply to all claims made before
January 3, 1982. After this date the
supplement is to be discontinued.
T o claim go to your local Unem-
ployment Benefit Office on the first
day of the vacation. Any earlier than
this they will turn you away, any
later and you will lose money since
payment cannot normally be back
dated. Take your P45 with you or a
note of your national insurance
number.
Rent Allowances and Rate
Rebates
As far as the world at large is
concerned, these are available for
anyone living on a low income who is
paying rent and has not signed a
'holiday' or 'company' let type of
agreement with their landlord. As far
as students in College residences
are concerned there still exists
considerable confusion and incon-
sistency as a result of the 1980
Housing Act which appears to allow
anyone in hostel-type accommo-
dation to claim rent rebates; a
situation which did not exist before
this Act and which has caused some
local boroughs to over-react against
student applications. While Kensing-
ton and Chelsea are processing as
normal and will also consider claims
from students in College Halls who
can show that they live there
throughout the year, Westminster
will not deal with students who live in
any type of accommodation rented
through the College. We are hoping
to effect a more liberal attitude from
Westminster, but this may take time
and will be aided by the accumula-
tion of evidence from other boroughs
on their procedures. To this end we
will be sending out questionnaires to
the head tenancies on the results of
applications for rebates and would
also appreciate information from
anyone in private sector accommo-
dation who has applied.
To return to basics; what are
these rebates and are they worth
applying for anyway? Well, they do
not normally offset so much of the
rent as SB, but their advantages are
that they can be paid while you are
away from your accommodation, in
some cases during termtime and
they do not entail all the hassle of
'signing on'.
H o w Rent and Rate Rebates are
worked out
As with SB the rent is firstly equated
with similar accommodation which
has been fair-rented. Then a 25%
deduction is usually made for
furniture, with a further amount
deducted (up to 25%) if heating is
included in the rent. The rate
element ( a p p r o x 25%) is also
removed, but this will be subject to
its own rebate. The basic rebate will
be between 20% and 30% of the
remaining figure. The percentage
varies according to the rent payable,
shrinking as the rent increases.
However, if your income is less than
£37.35 (the single person's housing
benefit needs allowance), as it
normally will during the vacation,
then 25% of the difference between
the income and the needs allowance
your income is more than the needs
allowance then the basic rate is
reduced by 17% of the difference
between the income and the needs
allowance.
During the termtime £10.85 is
t a k e n from both y o u r weekly
maintenance allowance of £38.54
and your rent before the above
calculations are made.
If a rate rebate can be applied for
it is not subject to a n y initial
reductions, but the calculations tend
to be even more tortuous without
providing a very clear indication of
the linal outcome. T h e rent officers
stress that each application for rent
and rate rebates is unique and subject
to its own variations, which makes it
difficult to give an average example.
Hopefully the results of our ques
tionnaire will eventually enable us to
give more definite expectations.
All students in the head tenancies
will have rates included in their rent.
This should be clearly indicated on
the application form, even though
you will not normally know the
amount. The rent officer will work
t h i s p a r t out f r o m the o t h e r
information given. College Hall rents
do not include rates since this is paid
by the U G C . Most other forms of
tenancy will include rates unless
they are specifically excluded. While
many students will not qualify for
rent allowances during termtime it is
possible that a rate rebate may apply
since this part of the rent is not
subject to the same reductions.
H o w to apply for Rent and Rate
Rebates
This can be done at any time. The
earlier the better, since Kensington
has a two month processing delay as
a result of the recent supplementary
rate.
Some Town Halls or Council
Offices will send you a form if you
phone them, others will prefer you
to collect and some are even
distributing them throughout the
district. They will be listed in the
phone book under the name of your
Borough. Those nearest IC are
noted below. You will also need to
produce the same documents as
d e s c r i b e d for S u p p l e m e n t a r y
Benefit.
If you run into a problem when
claiming any of these benefits let us
know since we may be able to help
and we appreciate any information
that can usefully be passed on to
others.
