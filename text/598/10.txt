IC: had a successful afternoon al Highgatc
School on November 18 winning 27 ol the 45
lights, with only 2 of the 5 teams being
defeated.
Sieve Parker contributed to the Second
Foils victory by winning all three of his lights,
and Steve Taylor did the same for the Epee,
which was no mean feat since he fenced all
three bonis in a row.
The sabreurs suffered slightly under the
keen blade of the e n t h u s i a s t i c H i g h g a t c
Captain, but despite this. Olivier L a m b r o n
won three good lights and no blood was
drawn.

Once again I C made hard work of 'tonking'
a bunch of wallies despite the volumes of beer
swilling support on a shitty day. Linesman
M a u r i c e presented his posterior to a poodle
and was bitten for his trouble. Dave M c G e e
was tireless and versatile with the bucket and
our expensive Medisport.
Pete Richards opened the scoring, falling
through people before his opposite man even
arrived at the match and needless to say the
conversion was well missed in true I C tradi-
tion.
Faz displayed all his skills and wins this
weeks M r Disco title but will be most remem-
bered lor his startling back somersault. Phil
Verity vented his aggression by laying into a
couple of Fosters lins that had inadvertently
invaded the pilch.
M a r k e r s g e n e r o u s l y let S t u J o h n s
score alter an amazing run over, round and
through most of the opposition. A n d shock
horror! It was converted by Phil Eastland
who also kicked a penalty. Faz and Baldy
Davies added to the scoresheet in their own
inimitable style.

By the way, the score was 21-7 to Imperial

conditions. M a r y did a good job in looking

Seconds
O n Wednesday IC Seconds resumed their
tour ol Greater London, ibis time finding
themselves in S i d e u p lo p l a y a s t r o n g
Middlesex Hospital side.
The wet and windy conditions contributed
to making the first half a scrappy affair. I C
spent most of this half in the oppositions' '25',
but were unable to capitalise on this position,
due mainly to mishandling and a lack of
commitment from the forwards.
The second half started with I C resuming
their territorial advantage, and with the
team d i s p l a y i n g s p i r i t , so the first try
wasn't long in coming. Alter a penalty move,
the Ibrwards drove up field to within five
yards of the line, where R o b i n Frith picked
up the loose ball to score in the corner.
Forward pressure continued, and a ruck on
the opposition's line resulted in the ball being
fed out to Charles Henderson, standing off. to
drive over the line. M i c k Winsor's conversion
must rate as goal of the season, kicking from
the touehline and against the wind. The third
try again came from a ruck, with Chris Cole
picking up and touching down, to give the
linal score I C 14 Middlesex Hospital 0.

W i t h only 9 players battling against driving
rain and a gale force wind, we should have
been no match for 11 healthy agriculturalists
but by hall-time we were 1-0 up due to brilli-
ant play by everybody. However, Wye were a
very good side and in the second half their
skill, combined with a strong wind behind
them, got the better of us (plus the fact that we
had no backs!) and the end result was a 2-1
win for Wye. This was a pity because we had a
number of chances to score.
Well done everybody who played—I'll get
a full team out yet! M a n y thanks to 'eagle
eyes' Johnson for umpiring the whole game
single-handed.

tjk Sailing
Last Saturday up at the H a r p we sailed
against teams from Southampton and Essex,
who kindly allowed IC to demonstrate their
fantastic skills by being beaten yet again.
Southampton won 2-1 in a match that
became a farce due to the organiser giving us
two very slow boats—of one which appeared
to be in an advanced state of leprosy!
In the second match against Essex we lost
2-0, the excuses this time being the two
surviving members of last year's team —
G r a h a m (Neoprene) Kennedy and Pat Mills
G r a h a m showed great skill at collecting
penalty points by repeatedly ramming the
opposition and Pat tried to sail the wrong
way round the course, attacked a bony (yes
you perverts that's bouv with a uj and
contributed further to the destruction of his
boat.
Congratulations to new members A n i l a ,
G r a h a m D., J u l i a n and R i c h a r d — a n d one of
you can write this bloody report next time.
