Suzanne Lindsey and Pat Palmer travelled to
the London Equestrian Centre to compete in
the U L U Riding League for the first time this
year, and won against experienced opposition.
Caroline won the dressage, Suzanne won the
jumping, and Pat is our treasurer?! W e hope to
repeat our success in the remaining three
matches.
Snooker
Only one match last week, this featuring the
amazing B team who continued on their merry
way by beating L S E ' B ' 4-1. It would have been
5-0 if Andy "Don't break my beer glass" Wright
hadn't come up against a pretty useful player
who was miles better than anything their A
team had the previous week.
Away from the league scene, there will be a
number of competitions starting soon, the first
of these being the P o t L u c k D o u b l e s o n
Sunday, December 6. Look out for the notice
in the snooker room. Also, the first rounds of
the Billiards Open and Handicap Tournaments
will be starting soon, so come along and sign
up for those as well. All these competitions are
open to any member of the club.
PS: Look out for small ad detailing F R E E
membership for the 300th person to join.
PPS: W e are arranging trips to Wembley
and Sheffield for major tournaments in the new
year, come and sign up as soon as possible.
Debating
If you think it pretty disgraceful that IC is
without a Debating Society, then you are not
alone. If you are interested in starting/joining a
new one, come along to Huxley 140 at 1:00pm
on Thursday, December 8.
Experience is not essential. T h e imper-
tinence to expound from a lecturn a view with
which you may in fact disagree is all that is
required! Since a good turnout on Thursday is
essential if a Debating Society is to be started,
be brave and turn up.
Industrial
We still have a few places left on the Tube
Investments Business Game, which simulates
a manufacturing process from raw materials to
marketing. This takes place in the afternoon of
Wednesday, November 2 in College and will
be most humorous and interesting. Contact
Alistair Kirk, Physics 2 for details.
Monday, November 30 Trip to Mars, and
W e d n e s d a y , D e c e m b e r 9, " S i m p l y Y e a r s
Ahead" invasion of the Philips labs, Redhill,
both meet at Beit A r c h 12:50 for 1:00pm
kickoff.
A d v a n c e w a r n i n g — we have a g e n e r a l
meeting on December 10, so read next week's
F E L I X for the gen.
BLOOD DONING
Tues 8 and Wed 9 December
Union Dining Hall
10:00am-12:00 and 2:00 4:00pm
Your blood is needed.
Where a m I? Imperial College. What do you
want? Information. S o y o u read S F S o c
Bulletins already? Y o u won't learn anything
here mate! By hook or by crook, we will.- Who
is Publicity Officer of the S F Soc? That would
be telling. W h o are you? I a m the new author
of S F Soc Bulletins. Well who wrote last
week's then? Y o u are a student.
But you knew that already, didn't you? If you
came to the "Superheroes What's M y Line"
you might know more, even if you know damn
all about the books of Harry Harrison. A s far
as 2001 goes 1 still think its a great film, even
with rotten sound and focus. The rotten sound
was explained in a previous bulletin. A s for the
focus 1 received a very moving monologue
from an Ents person on the difficulties of
focussing an anamorphic lens attachment and
have nothing but sympathy for him. Anyway,
"Bedazzled" is not in scope, so no worries
there. N o real news, everything's pending, i.e.
what's c o n f i r m e d y o u already k n o w , a n d
nothing further is known on what you don't.
Did that make sense? Well I think so. Mark
Smith 's Editorial Policy dictates that I stop
here. S o long stuff fans.
Scout & Guide
The Scout and Guide weekend to Brecon
seemed confined to hikes in Hyde Park on
Friday afternoon, when it was discovered that
the College minibus didn't work. However,
Kate Malcolm and Austin were kind enough to
lend their c a r s , a n d so after piling in all
fourteen of us, and gear, we drove off in to the
west
Base camp was the first Brecon scout hut,
from which we set off the next morning. Half of
the group did a ridge walk over P e n y fan
which was interesting as the wind was high and
the cloud base low, although we had a terrific
view of the countryside on the way down. The
other group went down White Lady cave,
which even had a rabbit guarding the entrance.
After cooking supper, there was a trip to the
local hostelry, followed by rope technique
demonstrations back at the hut. Even 6" off
the ground it looked a trifle desperate
O n Sunday the caving contingent, clearly
enjoying the luxury of having wetsuits, swam
t h r o u g h parts of porth-yr-ogof cave a n d
splashed around in pools outside. The walkers
went up onto the Beacons again and practised
walking 'off plumb' in high winds on Craig y
fan. W e had another impressive view of clouds
moving up the valley as we walked down the
reservoir.
Stew and dumplings for supper squashed
down nicely during the trip back to London
after a most enjoyable weekend.
H.G.Wells
Wellsoc will r e c o m m e n c e its lecture pro-
g r a m m e this M o n d a y with H e i n z Wolffe
addressing the society on Medical Engineering.
T h e a v e r a g e age of o u r s o c i e t y ( n o t
Wellsoc!) is steadily increasing due to the
sharp drop in the birth rate with the advent of
better a n d more readily available c o n t r a -
ception in the past few decades. This brings
ever increasing demands o n o u r medical
services lo cater for our aging population.
H e i n z Wolffe will be l e c t u r i n g o n the
advances in medical eri'jiriering in our society.
Dr Wolffe's oratory is surpassed only by his
ability to generate excitement and interest in
whatever subject he is speaking o n . This
promises to be one of Wellsoc's finest lectures,
so don't miss it! Monday, Mech Eng 220, 7:30.
Consoc
The speaker meeting with William Whitelaw
was well attended and the Home Secretary
spoke on various topics including Ireland and
the recent race riots. IT is very rare that
Imperial College has guest speakers of this
calibre. Fortunately the Conservative Society
have Sir Keith Joseph, Minister for Education,
coming next term and various other speakers
throughout the year.
O n December 3 Barney Heyhoe, M P will be
speaking in Huxley 340 at 1:00pm.
If y o u a r e i n t e r e s t e d i n j o i n i n g t h e
Conservative Society, membership will be
available at the meeting.
Ents
Where were you on the 19th? Were you one of
the hopeful perverts gathered in ME220 to
w a t c h the T r a d e D e s c r i p t i o n s A c t being
violated (you weren't expecting the live male
strip show, were you?) O h my G o d ! Escape
From Alcatraz can only be better (and more
erotic??). Hope you all enjoyed Carnival (who
can be bothered with paragraphs)—more of
the same next term—watch this space! STill
watching? Good! Once more we plug good ole
"Bumble and the Beez" (Black polythene and
a l l ) — o n l y a week away; be there for the
faberoonie event of that week. And for all you
closet fetishists, a solid dose of aural attack the
following Friday with "Overkill" can only be
s t r o n g l y r e c o m m e n d e d . G o o d to see a
"review" if you know worrimean.
Bookshop News
Important Announcement
Logic for Problem Solving by Robert Kowalski.
This is one of the recommended books, for
computing studies. Both the author and myself
were assured that a paperback edition would
be available in this country by October. But
unfortunately, this was not to be, however the
publisher has offered us a slight reduction in
price on our latest delivery. Therefore we are
able to offer it at £11.00 as opposed to £14.00.
Sad to say we cannot give a refund on copies
already purchased as we have had to pay the
full price.
