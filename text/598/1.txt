Council gets Goat
ICU Council met at 6:00pm on Tuesday last week. During
the long and sometimes arduous meeting the Deputy
President, Barney McCabe was censured, and it was
revealed that a £1.50 rent rise for all College residence
(except Head Tenancies) is likely next term.
T h e President's R e p o r t was dealt w i t h first. T h e r e was m u c h
discussion o n the refectories, the joint I C / Q E C w o r k i n g p a r t y ,
bars, a n d residence. W h i l s t d e a l i n g w i t h residence, M r M o r t o n
shocked m e m b e r s o f C o u n c i l by a n n o u n c i n g that there w o u l d
p r o b a b l y be a £1.50 rent rise next term. H e thought that the
U n i o n w o u l d have to accept this despite policy against m i d -
session increases.
T h e D e p u t y President's report was taken next. M r M c C a b e ' s
report was w r i t t e n i n a flippant, sarcastic tone, as he reported
what he h a d been d o i n g since last C o u n c i l . H e h a d been
" h a v i n g a great t i m e " " g i v i n g people disinfectant for c l e a n i n g

reported m a n y things he hadn't done. C h r i s W e b b ( M a n S c i
D e p R e p ) referred the report back a n d m o v e d a m o t i o n of
censure. O n a paper ballot the m o t i o n was passed by 15 votes to
7, w i t h 4 abstentions.
T h e n , after p l o u g h i n g t h r o u g h m a n y sets o f U n i o n c o m m i t t e e
