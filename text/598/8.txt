EXEC VIEWS
T h e r e are still two posts vacant on the
A c a d e m i c Affairs C o m m i t t e e : one for an
ordinary member, and another for secretary of
the committee. It is very important that these
posts should be filled in if the committee is to
run effectively.
The objects of the committee are:
a) The investigation of the purpose and
structure of the degree system, together with
its means of assessment.
b) The co-ordination of all Academic Affairs
sub-committees and staff/student committees
within Imperial College.
Subjects discussed vary from the perennial
problem of unsatisfactory maths lecturing for
non-maths specialist students, to the Sir Peter
S w i n n e r t o n - D y e r R e p o r t o n A c a d e m i c
Organisations. Future topics may concern
what effects the government cuts are having
on the various departments within College and
how departments will be reorganised if the
merger with Q E C that is being discussed, is
c a r r i e d o u t . T h e time t a k e n up is not
excessive; the committee only meets two or
three times a term and the post of secretary
involves only a little extra work in the writing of
minutes and posting of notifications for
meetings.
If y o u wish to stand for one of these
vacancies you can put your name up on the
papers in the Lower Lounge in the Union
Building together with the signatures of the
requisite number of seconders. The election
will be held at the U G M on Tuesday.
Marco
And now, the incredibly entertaining Barney
McCabe
H i , I'm back again. Please read my report in
Exec News and come to the U G M . If it is more
than 50% above the quorum, just for your enjoy
ment I'll take my trousers down. S E X (That
was just to draw people's attention to the arti-
cle, here comes another one) P A N T I E S . To
continue, a brief resume of what you may like
to know.
1. Rape alarms are available from me in the
Union Office F R E E from now on. These are for
women who may be using the G y m changing
rooms alone. I will demonstrate the alarm at
the U G M so that students in general might
' recognise the sound and be ready to take
appropriate action should there be an incident.
2. Please do not abuse the Beit T V Lounge.
This facility is paid for by Beit residents and is
theirs. In particular do not take drinks from the
Bar into the Lounge, and please respect the
wishes of residents, in respect of noise and use
of chairs. There will be serious action taken if
A B U S E by non-residents continues.
3. Very soon the Lower Lounge will receive
some new bins, ashtrays and tables. These
should improve the untidy nature of the place.
4. Thank you 'Carnival' organisers for not
letting the building get too damaged.
5. Don't miss the opportunity of visiting the
R C S Centenary exhibition, most informative
and interesting.
6. Attention all clubs and societies. If you
want allocated, labelled, noticeboard space,
you must fill in the form in the Union Office
even if you have a patch at present. A major
review into noticeboard allocations is taking
place so be sure to get what you W A N T .
7. If anybody has a key to any Union room,
cupboard, padlock or to any area containing
Union property and which they have obtained
before October 1 1981 I want to know. If you
do not come and tell me, you will not be able to
reclaim any D E P O S I T paid on this key. I must
know before 5:30pm on Friday, December 11,
1981 and I must see the key. When the locks
are changed your chances of obtaining a new
key may be prejudiced by failing to do this.
Ed's Note:
M a y I take this o p p o r t u n i t y to thank M r
M c C a b e for his enormous efforts on behalf of
the U n i o n this year and for writing this
incredibly witty and entertaining article which
has made this issue of F E L I X worthwhile (who
said sarcasm was dead?).

N B : The Mines Ball is on December 18 not
December 8 as was printed last week—tickets
are available from R S M U , and post-dated
cheques are accepted (within reason!!).
T h e r e is an R S M R a g C o l l e c t i o n o n
Saturday morning—no one has an excuse for
not turning out, as the sports games for that
day don't begin until the afternoon. Therefore
we can all meet in R S M U at 9:30am.
Although this year's Rag Mag is not on sale,
anyone who would like past years editions,
they are available at 20p each in the Union
Office.
Don't forget to puf your name down for
Camborne before the list is taken down.
Caynor
Basically, just a list of events this week:
1. The Centenery Ball, tonight, 7:30 for

the football by an enormous margin.
City & Guilds
W e l l it's b e e n a fairly q u i e t w e e k this
w e e k — w e l l what wouldn' t be quiet after
Carnival? Year Rag was supposed to be this
Saturday, but due to a problem about licenses
this has been postponed—sorry to all the soc
and dep reps w h o have spent hours (?)
organising it.
O n Tuesday there's a visit to the pub of the
week which is the Brittania Tap on Warwick
Rd. (If you don't know where it is see Andy's
brilliant map in Guildsheet.)
O n T h u r s d a y t h e r e a r e t h e i n t e r -
departmental pedal car races in Princes Gdns
at 12:30. If you want to be in your team, see
your soc reps before it's too late.
Band Ahoy!
S T O I C is looking for College bands who would
like to appear in front of the cameras, for
inclusion in a recorded music programme (in
colour).
The programme will be shown, either later
this term or early next term, on the S T O I C
n e t w o r k — J C R , S o u t h s i d e T V L o u n g e ,
Southside, Beit, Linstead and Weeks Halls.
Several of the groups who have appeared on
similar programmes in recent years have gone
on to use our video recordings of their
performances for promotional purposes.
Anyone interested in taking part should
c o n t a c t L a w r e n c e W i n d l e y ( C h a i r m a n ) ,
Michael Hackett (Secretary) or any other
S T O I C m e m b e r as s o o n as possible by
