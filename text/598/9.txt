The Beastly Beatitudes of Balthazar B.
Based on the novel by J.P. Donleavy.
Starring Simon Callow and Patrick
Ryecart. Directed by Ron Daniels. Duke
of York's Theatre, St. Martin's Lane.
This immensely enjoyable play took me
completely by surprise. The leaflet advertising
the play depicts two young men lying virtually
on top of a well-endowed young lady; all of
t h e m are u n c l a d . U n d e r the s o m e w h a t
suspicious title are the words: "The world
premiere of a bawdy and joyous new play ",
and on the back of the leaflet are such quotes
from critics as 'lush and lovely, bawdy and sad,
robust and warm delights'. I was tempted to
bring along my dirty mac. However, it was just
as well that I didn't because the play could
hardly have been more different than I had
anticipated.
The play is based on the novel of the same
name by J . P . Donleavy, an ex-boxer who has
become one of today's giants of contemporary
literature. A s a writer, Donleavy sees himself
as "a kind of journalist—going out and picking
up stories". Indeed, the novel was conceived in
a traffic jam in Knightsbridge!
The curtain rises on a student's room in
Trinity College, Dublin, the room, in fact, of
B a l t h a z a r , a reserved, handsome F r e n c h
prince played by Patrick Ryecart. The other
prinicipal personality in the play is Beefy, a
most outrageous character; extrovert, upper-
class, gentlemanly, stocky and loveable, a
student of divinity and intellectually the most
brilliant student of the College, but who has an
insatiable appetite for carnal lust of a most
unspeakable variety. This character is played
most convincingly by Simon Callow. The play
centres around the strong friendship that
developes between these two seemingly
opposite personalities and the strength that

each imparts to the other as they descend the
downward spiral of life.
Trouble starts when Beefy brings two girls of
'ill-repute' into Balthazar's room and indulges
in a feast of sin, while Balthazar looks upon the
proceedings with indifference. The Junior
Dean bursts in and has the two expelled.
Balthazar, however, has not lost everything.
Before this unfortunate incident, Elizabeth
Fitzdare (played by Susan Gilmore) proposed
to him. She seems to be too good to be true,
beautiful, Christian, full of poise and graceful
looks. The engagement is rudely shattered
when the trustees of Balthazar will not agree to
the marriage. During his loneliness, he falls
into the traps of another girl and a subsequent

v a n q u i s h the t h o u g h t s of the b e a u t i f u l
Fitzdare, and when his wife leaves the house,
his thoughts turn to Alphonsine (played by
Lizzie Romilly) a more than attractive French
au-pair. The scene that follows is one of the
most captivating I have ever beheld. In a most
sensuous F r e n c h accent A l p h o n s i n e tan-
talisingly describes her boyfriend back home in
superlative terms, leaving Balthazar feeling
totally inadequate but all the more desirous of
A l p h o n s i n e . L i z z i e R o m i l l y ' s accent and
mannersims are a sheer pleasure to behold,
and one that I shall never forget.

indulgences cause him to become a disin-
herited outcast. The two manage to hold their
heads above the sea of troubles by means of
their mutual friendship.
This most endearing play is at once comic,
thoughtful and touching. It is well worth a visit.
The Seven Deadly Sins (of Ordinary
People) Ballet Chante by Kurt Weill. Text
by Bertolt Brecht. Les Mamelles de
Tiresias (The Breasts of Tiresiast).
Opera-Bonffe by Francis Poulenc. Text
by Guillaume Apollincaire from his
original play. Opera double-bill at the
English National Opera, St. Martin's
Lane.
Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht collaborated
on the 'sung ballet'. The Seven Deadly Sins, in
1933. T h e w o r k is Weill's last before he
emigrated to America and a 'second career'
composing Broadway musical. Brecht revises
the traditional meanings of the seven sins
(sloth, pride, anger, gluttony, lust, avarice and
envy) in the light of c o n t e m p o r a r y social
values. Weill's score is exceptionally varied in
style and features prominantly the banjo and
the guitar. It is melodious and at times
beautiful and expresses a parody and criticism
of hypocrisy. The end result is song and dance
combined to rare and appealing effect.
Anna leaves home in tbe Mid-West of the
U S to make her, and her family's, fortune.
Her nature, as with the rest of us, is two-fold:
practical A n n a and idealist Anna. The two
aspects of her nature assume two persons in
the opera. Practical Anna, played by Jenny
Weston, goes into show business as a dancer
and strives to make her way to the top in the
search of fortune and recognition. Idealist
Anna, played by Marti Webb (alias Eva Per6n
in Evita), looms over the practical Anna as she
dances her way through the following scenes.
Which of Anna's two aspects are the more
important for making her way up in the world?
The seven deadly sins are committed by Anna
as she succeeds in reaching the top of her
profession and by her family back home, who
begin to live off her riches. However, at the top
of her career, Anna is still unhappy. She
returns home, rich and successful but grown
up and responsible, apparently all the more
wise after her experiences. In the end, the
idealist Anna appears to triumph and the
practical Anna appears to have been broken,
but the former confides to the latter: " Y o u can
still be a hero, but it won't achieve anything.
The heroes-those who stand up for moral
principles and rights—have only death to look
forward to." Each sin has been made out to be
the reverse of what one might expect and the
terrifying message of Anna's family is that you
only get on at all if you don't give in to the
temptation of standing up for what you believe.
The work is only forty minutes long but is
superbly finished and executed. The designs
are simple but very effective. My only criticism
is that the structure of the work is a little
simplistic and lacks a smooth flow. It is rather
like a m e d i e v a l t a p e s t r y of four s c e n e s
depicting the four virtues.
N o d o u b t y o u have seen a s u r r e a l i s t
painting, can see an example of surrealist
theatre in the_ form of L e s Mamelles de
Tiresias. The opera is based on the play by
Guillaume Apallimaire. It was he who, in an
i n t r o d u c t o r y note written for the play's
p r e m i e r e in 1917, i n v e n t e d the w o r d
s u r r e a l i s m , thus giving a name to a new
movement in art and literature. He wrote "to
make, if not a new movement in the theatre, at
least a personal statement, I thought it
necessary to return to nature itself, without
imitating it like a photograph. When Man
wanted to imitate walking, and created the
wheel—which does not look like a leg—he
created surrealism without knowing it "
Composed by Poulenc in 1948, the opera is
a comedy of modern day morality. It presents
a hilarious and satirical view of feminism, sex-
changes, male chauvinism and the problems of
single parent families where the father gives
birth to babies! Marilyn Hill Smith plays the,
part of the 'mother' and Emile Beicourt plays
that of the 'father'. A s is to be expected from
surrealist art the plot, and especially the stage
designs, are highly bizarre and amusing. In
fact, it is very difficult to know how much of
the work, if any, is meant to be taken seriously;
one is forever trying to discern the intentions
of the author. However, the opera is most
unusual and entertaining, if a little baffling.
