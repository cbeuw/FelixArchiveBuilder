Dear M u m m y
Please don't worry about my eating habits.
Lots of people have novel ideas lor recipes.
Here's an example of one I received this
Saturday.
Harlington Hot Pot
Take 4 Carnival goers, or 3 if you feel its too
strong
(Slows the whole mixture down.)
T o p up with another 7 blues
(This adds body to the mixture)
A d d 11 reds
(This provides an ideal match, especially if
served in a cup)
"Stop schlurping the wine Johnny"
W a r m up for 5mins (or 30 if Carnival goers
added)
T o get the whole mixture started add a pea
(Ones from whistle are ideal)
Simmer gently for 45mins. then add oranges,
return to heat and bring to boil lor another
45mins.
T o add piquancy sprinkle liberally with goals
(6 blue and 2 red produces.a satisfactory
result)
" f o r God's sake, stop schlurping the wine
J o h n n y ! "
Pilchards t a n be included, but may prove
too lively (cheers boys!)
N B : Be careful nol to add too much Reeve as
this can upset the whole mixture.
Serve with copious amounts of beer (and cig-
arettes for Aled)
Love F . B - R
PS: The rash and I have come to an under-
standing. He leaves my friends alone, and I
leave oil V a l Derma.

" A A A A A H " we've won again. This is be-
coming boring. We play good, we play bad,
we always win. It's pointless playing. W h y do
we?
Observations during the match.
i) Ron's got really short legs.
ii) Steve doesn't close his legs.
iii) A n d y can't close his legs.
iv) M a r t i n never uses his legs.
Grass grows very, very slowly.
Teams: same as during the match.
Fifths
Following on their success on Wednesday in
the L e a g u e , against I V , the F i l t h s
produced probably the most outstanding
performance of the season by any IC team.
The Fifth's H a m p t o n was particularly
outstanding. Whenever the I C defence was
penetrated, H a m p t o n stood erect in the goal
growing inches on occasions to tip certain
ellorts a w a y , a n d was a l w a y s q u i c k at
coming oil his line.
Good performances in defence from N .
A u d i n , D. Rogers, M . Haberlin (1), S. Kler;
in midfield by K . Chamberlain, N . Gaskill
(1). B. Dhillon, and up front D . Stephenson,
S. Coussens, J. Healy (2).
M e n t i o n must also be made of a brilliant
l a s t - g a s p t a c k l e by B. D h i l l o n on D .
Stephenson when the latter/former was clean
through.
T e a m : as given + A . N . H a m p t o n in goal.
The Sports Editor (who definitely isn't a
power-crazed megalomaniac) would like to
thank everyone who submitted articles this
week.
She would also appreciate it if someone
would submit a man lor her next week, along
with their report, to make pasting-up a bit
more exciting.

H a v i n g been stuffed by league leaders,
Staines last week, we were totally annihilated
by second place Ashford this week.
W h y d i d n ' t somebody i n v i t e t h e m to
Guilds Carnival? (Whv didn't we stay in
bed?)
Intimidated by the posing of the Ashford
inside right (ex-Emgland, G B , Universe, etc.),
IC allowed him to walk through their defence
obtaining numerous short corners. Ashford
finally converted one of these while Clarke
was r e - t y i n g his shoelace, C o a t e s w o r t h
adjusting his flourescent ankle protectors,
and Slatter watching Concorde take oil.
Oranges have no eifect on hangovers or on
Clarke's reaction time. Playing a true skippers
role he was judged by the umpire (?) to have
deliberately trod on the ball without moving
his feet. Ashford's "megastar" converted the
penalty Hick with little difficulty*
College, having left it much too late, now
realised that the Carnival had finished eight
hours ago and started to produce some clear
chances—all of which were missed, due to
poor finishing (bring back Cope!)
O u r promotion hopes are fading fast, but a
w i n next week c o u l d put us b a c k i n
contention!
Team: Sltilter, Coalesworl/i. Parker, Franklin
Riley, Rao, Clarke, Bell, Baleson, Bansal, Galley.
Seconds
W i t h an umpire like Pete Hughes
We were never going to lose
So while Ashford got mad
A n d played really bad
W e duly beat them three-two.
'fhe lirst goal came from Wylie
W h o tucked it away very slyly
It bounced oil' his chest
We were very impressed
But their goalie complained very slightly.
Then M i k e scored after a bit
A n d A n d y from a short hit
Their captain went red
—at the end he said
" Y o u r umpire's a load of rubbish!"
Eat your heart out M u h a m m a d A l i !
T e a m : Bullet, Cunningham, Roessink, Ramplon,
Whitehead, Stroomer, Garms, Farmer, Wylie,
Mitchell, Pilkethly.
Thirds
The glorious Thirds drew 1-1 with Thames
Valley Seconds.
IC arrived early and knocked up on the
squelchy clearing behind the clubhouse on
which T V set up the goalposts! W e b b scored
from a short. Some prat complained about
this short, but being their centre forward he
was at the other end of the pitch. Pound got
him in the teeth later on.
Piss-artist of the month to Sharpe for
laughing at the opposition, and after hitting
the ball away from a free hit saying "Sorry
U m p i r e , I didn't hear the whistle!"
Thanks to Taylor for playing left wing and
thus keeping out of the way.
Taylor and W e b b made a spirited attempt
to walk oil' with someone else's jug. Witter
lead the offensive to sneak up and get a
second tea; Cattell was slow to catch on and*
went up and asked for another!
Team: Jones, Catlell, Sharpe, Webb, Stocking,
Shindler, Witter, Mahers, "Taylor, Allan, Benham.
Umpire: Purdy.

M y mate Nobber says:
C a r n i v a l was great.
Non-existent back row.
Constant overlap.
40-12 to them.
Cheers!

O n Saturday we played Streatham on a pitch
that could have been used for a ski run. In the
first half we played up the slope and were
under constant pressure from the Streatham
l o r w a r d s a n d b a c k s . H o w e v e r , due to
excellent tackling from the backs and back
row we managed to keep them out until the
last m i n u t e of the first half, w h e n the
Streatham right wing crashed over in the
c o r n e r . So at h a l l - t i m e it was 4-0 to
Streatham.
In the second half, we had the slope and
the wind, and spent the whole lime in their
half of the pitch. Alter many near chances, J .
Paxaio dribbled the ball over the line lor our
lirst try. Then alter a good scrum move, J .
Davies crashed over the line for our second
try. M . Winsor converted the try, and so the
match ended 10-4 in our favour.
T e a m : M. Thomason, M. Winsor, G. Pike,
W. Chapman, R. Flynn, V. Brummel, J. Paxaio,
S. Bell, C. Cole, A. Chalklen, C. Henderson, J.
ColIon, W. hing, J. Danes, II'. Asian.
Thirds
At 11:30 18 players were expected. 'Injury'
p r o b l e m s a g a i n — left w i t h 13. C o u l d
Streatham come with less? N o , they were to
arrive with 14. We had to supply a ref. O n l y
two players had not been to the Carnival and
therefore were in a lit state to ref. Thanks to
Phil Hughcs-Nai borough who 'volunteered'.
T h e o t h e r n o n - c a r n i v a l p l a y e r j e r e r m
H o b d a y scored a l l three tries a n d the
conversion. The 'walking dead' staggered-
their way through a scrappy game which
they would have won easily (despite only 12
men) had it not been lor the n i g h t / m o r n i n g
before. The team retains their 100% unbeaten
record.
Thanks to A r t h u r who provided tea and
oranges at zero notice.
