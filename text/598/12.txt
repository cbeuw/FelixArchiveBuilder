What's On
Last Week
I have received a lengthy but anonymous
discourse on the errors in last week's FELIX.
When I awoke, bleary-eyed on Friday after a
long week plagued by a mechanical error, I
realised that I had really rushed through in
o r d e r t o m a i n t a i n a F r i d a y p u b l i c a t i o n
deadline. T h e William Whitelaw story was
appalling, mainly because I was let down by my
original reporter at a vulnerable time, and did
not have the time or energy to personally re-
arrange and improve it.
If I for one moment believed that everybody
was as critical as my correspondent, I would
not have produced an issue at all—but I think
maintaining a regular publication is very
important and is appreciated by many people.
The most disappointing thing for me and my
staff is that the result of one of our hardest
weeks work (i.e. that issue) could never truly
represent the time involved (many "good"
issues have been produced with less effort). I
am not superhuman and can only stand two or
three fourteen hour days a week.
Unlike the other sabbaticals, I am judged by
the whole of College E V E R Y FRIDAY. If an
issue is late or poorly presented for a n y
reason, if someone's letter or article does not
appear, if I make any errors of fact or
judgement then people complain. Praise is a
much appreciated rarity. A n d I must rely on
volunteers to be able to function at all.
A rather well-known puzzle generally called
the eight queens problem invites you to place
eight queens on a chessboard in such a way
that no two of them share a row, column, or
diagonal. (This includes all the diagonals, of
course, not just the two long ones.) The
diagram shows a correct solution under the
terms normally imposed.
But you will notice that the queens on the
first three rows of my solution, although they
do not lie o n any row, column or diagonal of
the chessboard, are nevertheless in an exact
straight line. What 1 am looking for this week is
a valid solution to the eight queens puzzle with
the added restriction that no three queens lie
in a straight line.
Solutions, comments, criticisms to me at the
FELIX Office please. A prize of £5 (donated by
Menda-Bike) for the correct solution
randomly selected at 1:00pm on Wednesday.
Last Week's Solution
A s expected, some of you found it trivial, and
some found it impossible. In fact the answers
to the first paper are simply the notes of 'God
Save the Queen' and the answers to the
s e c o n d paper are the notes of 'The Star
Spangled Banner' (both in C major). Apologies
to anyone who was badly fooled; I promise not
to set puzzles this cheeky very often.
So I must battle on, think up new ideas,
coax people into helping me and yet bear
uninformed criticisms from someone who is
too lazy and unconcerned to come in and help
or even find out how and why such errors
occur. Is it surprising that I therefore start to
feel bitter and will not print one unhelpful
individual's opinions?
The lack of appreciation and interest in
helping really make me feel that I am casting
pearl before swine. But as one who has been
elected (and is paid) to form the habit of
making a silk purse from a sow's ear, I suppose
I should at least be prepared to go the whole
hog.
Statistic
While four thousand people read FELIX
regularly, fewer than ten students are actually
concerned enough to put in a substantial
amount of effort to produce it. Talented and
d e d i c a t e d p e o p l e a r e n e e d e d who can
regularly devote some spare time to improving
and expanding the content. This doesn't mean
more boring clubs and society articles or
tediously long letters, but entertaining and
interesting features and better news coverage.
Original ideas will be welcomed, but must be
approved by the Editor (before y o u start
p r o d u c i n g reams and reams of unwanted
material!). It you wish to contribute or learn
more about FELIX, then come to the staff
meeting today (Friday) at 12:30pm in the
F E L I X Office. It's never too late to join us.
