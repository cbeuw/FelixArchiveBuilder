LONDON

Beneath the
city streets
One of the most fascinating books to be
published this year is London under London
by Richard Trench and Ellis Hillman. This
excellent book is a must for anyone who
possesses a mind remotely agile enough to
have enquired as to what lies beneath his
feet. When something is too dirty or too
secret or too dangerous to co-exist with us,
on our level, it is consigned to the depths,
and thus sometimes to obscurity. London
under London seeks to put this right with an
intriguing catalogue of the rivers, sewers,
railways, pipes, cables, and secret buildings
that lie beneath the city streets. It manages
it do so in an always interesting style, and
with occassional humour. At £14.95 it is not
a cheap book—but what glossy hardback
with colour plates is cheap today? An
invaluable work of reference, the book is
packed with information. For instance, did
you know about
South Kensington Knightsbridge Down St Piccadilly Circus
Brompton Road Dover St
The Underground War
At the beginning of the Second
World War, London Transport
forbade the use of underground
stations as air-raid shelters. By
the peak of the bombing,
however, 79 stations were being
used as shelters—the public
purchased the cheapest ticket
available, and went down below.
On the night of 27 September
1940, 117,000 people were
sleeping in the tubes. A whole
subterranean society developed
and some stations had their own
lending libraries, canteens and
even newsletters.
Conditions were pretty awful
for the shelterers—often there
were no lavatories and lice soon
spread from mattress to
mattress. And yet people still
came to the comfort and security
that being beneath the ground
afforded.
Official disapproval for the
shelters ended when Churchill
came to power. He established a
War Room beneath the Treasury
Hyde Park
Corner
and a whole underground citadel
in Horseferry Road. He also built
the Civil Defence headquarters
which were under the Geological
Museum on Exhibition Road.
This was linked to South
Kensington Station via the
familiar passenger subway. The
station itself was used—London
T r a n s p o r t ' s emergency
engineering equipment was
located in two disused deep-level
tunnels. These were originally
intended for a high-speed
District Line which has never
been completed. A number of
disused stations along the
Piccadilly line were also
employed (see plan).
Brompton Road station (1909-
1932) is near the Oratory
(opposite the Midnight Shop)
and can easily be identified from
the distinctive maroon tiles. It
housed the wartime anti-aircraft
control centre, and since the war
has been used by the Territorial
Army. Further up the line
towards Piccadilly Circus, were
Down Street and Dover Street
stations (Down Street is long
closed and Dover Street is now
Green Park). Down Street was
used by the Railways Executive
Committee and Dover Street as
the L o n d o n T r a n s p o r t
Emergency HQ.
The Post Office
Although the Underground
system is known to all, few are
aware of the Post Office 'Tube'.
Started in 1913, the Post Office
system of small, un-manned
electric trains extends from the
Mount Pleasant Post Office to
the mainline railway stations and
to district sorting offices.
Construction was halted during
the First World War when the
tunnels were used to house the
Elgin Marbles and other national
treasures. It was opened in 1927,
though, and within a year, one
quarter of London's mail vans
had disappeared from the
streets. Each station platform is
connected by lifts to the sorting
office.
Expansion took place in 1951
linking the Post Office with the
Government's tunnels under
Whitehall.
Access to the Post Office
tunnels is easy— as well as the
entrances in the Post Offices
themselves, there are a number
of manhole access points. In
December 1980 the New
Statesman held its Christmas
Party in one of the tunnels! Other
Government Departments have
also burrowed underground. In
the build-up to the Second World
War the Government built an
Admiralty underground centre
at Cricklewood, an Air Ministry
HQ at Harrow and the Cabinet
Office was underground at Dollis
Hill. The Admiralty Centre was
to be of use later during the
Falklands War.
London under London is
published by John Murray
priced £14.95, and is available
from all good booksellers. Ellis
Hillman, co-author, is a
governor of Imperial College.
