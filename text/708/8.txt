Union which resulted in about
two hundred students from other
London colleges arriving to
picket the event. Fearing bad
publicity the Rector persuaded
the R S M President to call the
event off at the last minute.
However, a large number of
demonstrators still turned up and
weren't easily persuaded that the
event was not taking place.
Shortly after the Christmas
vacation it was announced that
the Rector would be leaving to
take up the position of Vice
Chancellor of the University of
London. The search for a
successor started soon after but
none of the more obvious
candidates wanted the job. Soon
after the announcement was
made Lord Flowers was rushed
to hospital with a heart attack.
He was off work for several
months and is still only working
part-time.
Students in Evelyn Gardens
were told in January that work to
improve the properties would be
carried out in term-time,
requiring some residents to move
three times during the spring and
summer terms. Eventually the
College was persuaded that the
work could be done in the
vacation. The work was the first
stage of improvements required
on all the Student Houses by
K e n s i n g t o n a n d C h e l s e a
Council. The College has now
agreed to draw up a timetable for
the remaining work to satisfy the
Council and to avoid disruption
during term-time. The total cost
of the repairs will probably
exceed £250,000.

The loss of the Fremantle
Hotel required extra places to be
f o u n d to m a i n t a i n the
quaranteed places in residence
for first year UGs and overseas
P G freshers. The Student
Residence Committee (SRC )
decided to reduce the number of
re-applicants who have a second
year in hall or house from 10% to
8% overall.
Still in January, the Union's
finances were again in the news.
The Union Finance Committee
(UFC) decided that Constituent
College Unions (CCUs) should
not be able to carry over funds
left at the end of one year to the
following year. Next month the
decision was reversed by
Council, meeting at Silwood
Park. The attendance records
were broken as the C C U s
brought out their full voting
strength to push the decision
through.
Two successful Rag M a g
selling trips were held in January
and February. The first visited
fifteen universities in four days.
The RCS party was banned from
Keele and Loughborough and
other complaints were received
about the Rag Mag's contents.
However the two trips raised
around £2,500 and enabled Rag
to sell off many of their large
stockpile of old Rag Mags.
Early in February it was
announced that Michael Arthur
was to move from his job as
Student Services Officer in July
to a position in College
administration. M r Arthur was
much criticized in F E L I X last
year for not being concerned with
the problems of students. He is to
be replaced by Donald Ferguson
A stripper in the Union Bar
appeared on the cover of F E L I X
the following week. She had been
sent by a strip-o-gram service to
surprise a regular customer on
his birthday after a whip-round.
The tongue-in-cheek comment in
F E L I X that if they behaved like
this perhaps women shouldn't be
allowed in the bar was quoted in
'NUS News' as an example of
sexism at IC.
The mascot of Q M C student
u n i o n , M a r y (a wooden
Leopard), was stolen by a RCS
team posing as Q M C University
Challenge supporters. In a
revenge attack Q M C students
disabled an ICU minibus, which
was at Q M C for a business quiz.
The tables were turned when
Q M C students were hoaxed by
RCS into an attack on ICU which
they thought was organised by
Chelsea College. They were
ambushed by superior forces and
well and truly flanned.
