THE RAT RACE:
HOW TO GET48 HOURS' START
You'll need to get in training. And we
have just the programme.
Two days on our course won't just
teach you business theory, it'll also teach
you business practice.
We call it the Accountant's World'
course, but don't let the name put you off.
Instead of figures, you'll learn facts about
taxation, computing, management consult-
ancy and finance.
You'll examine case histories.
You'll even take part in the games that
business people play. In short, ours is a two-
day survival course in the corporate jungle.
Entrance isfree,but not necessarily easy.
(Places are limited to the best 50 applicants
who will be entering their final year in
October.)
The courses are held in September at
Cirencester, Durham and Warwick, so you'd
better be quick off the mark.
