and Jackie Pierce. During the
course of the evening the two
ladies persuaded Quentin that
they were both lesbians. Quentin

ICU President, Ian Bull is
generally believed to be content
with having only one woman in
his life. In fact however Ian is far
from content. Ian was overheard
last term reminiscing about his
antics while on an 18-30's
holiday. Ian told his friends how
he would get up at 4.00pm, go
down to the Disco and find
another woman to sleep with. Ian
then told his friends that he
intended to send Gay nor, his
girlfriend, to her mothers' while
he went on another 18-30's
holiday.

Just when you thought you'd
got rid of mad ICU deputy
president, Dave Parry it seems
he'll be back for another year.
Dave has been offered a job with
the Finance Section in Student
Services. So be warned, if hall
bills start whizzing randomly
around College next year, you'll
know whose fault it is.

Large FELIX photographer,
Nigel Atkinson, is a bit of a dark
horse when it comes to ladies.
Many an IC Student has
dispaired at the lack of women at
IC, and resigned themselves to
remaining single. Nigel, though,
refuses to give up. On one
occasion last term Nigel is
known to have offered his
substantial body to at least five
women. Unfortunately their
replies were not recorded.

The Union office has found a
new way of occupying itself when
ever the bookmaker is closed
and there is no cricket on
television. Dave Parry is sent
down to the refectory to pick up
an empty plastic milk container.
This is then blown up and used as
a volley ball.
