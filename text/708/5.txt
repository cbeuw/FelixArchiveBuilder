the FELIX interview
Rob Northey became Catering Manager just over a month
ago, after several months of working with Victor Mooney.
Since coming to College he has refused to be interviewed.
Last week he made his first public comments on his plans
for the future.
Rob Northey, the new Catering
Manager, and Victor Mooney
appear to have almost nothing in
common. Northey gives the
impression of being young,
ambitious and full of ideas,
attributes hardly applicable to
the Mooney of recent years. He
also seems determined to talk to
students, to find out what they
want, and tell them what he
thinks about refectories.
Bars
But first impressions of
Northey were not very good.
Stories circulated suggesting that
he wanted to put a television in
the Union Bar, and raise the price
of a pint to a pound. Northey
claims he was misquoted.
'When I first came here, I had
to ask people questions to get
reactions and I asked them if they
had tried different things. At the
moment the Union Bar has had
quite a lot of money spent on it
and there is a very successful
formula. We have no real ideas
about changing anything in this
area.'
In general, Northey is happy
about the performance of the
bars, although he would like to
see better use of the Real Ale Bar
and other areas that he believes
to be under used.
Improvements
In the refectories, on the other
hand, he believes that he must
make significant improvements.
His priority is to 'modernise the
refectories and bring them up to
date, considering that the last
major investment was twenty
years ago. Hopefully we can put
the refectories on a sound
financial footing with modern
facilities.'.
At the start of the year College
approached a firm of consultants
to redesign the Sherfield
Refectory. The firm responded
by producing a plan that
involved equipping the J C R as a
refectory, and converting the
present Main Dining Hall to a
JCR. College was intially keen to
carry out the plan, and even
considered starting the work this
summer. This idea now seems to
have been shelved. Northey
believes that the plans were 'not
totally s a t i s f a c t o r y ' . T h e
consultants, in his view, 'put such
a degree of luxury into the area,
making it so inflexible thai it
wouldn't fulfil the requirements
of the College, and the furniture
wouldn't last for the time we are
looking for'. The College needs
furniture that 'will look good in
five years time'.
'The Refectory needs to be a
modern, adaptable area that can
keep up with the times and
therefore with modular aspects.
Therefore, in the future, if we
find that a particular aspect of
the catering trade changes, we
can keep up with the trends,
which we can't with the present
rigid system.'
Southside
Northey sees Southside
Refectory as one of the most
urgent problems, there needs to
be a facelift there in the
immediate future.
His hobby is Chinese and
Indian cooking and he intends to
experiment with some exotic
meals. One possibility being
considered is having specialist
food evenings. He does realise
the problems, however.
'The present system is very
hampered by the present serving
arrangements which restrict the
versatility of the types of food
that can be served. This will be
taken into consideration when
we are designing the new
refectory areas. We would like
feedback from the students about
whatwe should be producing. A
lot of attention will be given to
the ethnic minority groups,
although it will be impossible to
cater f o r a l l of t h e m .
Unfortunately we would need
twenty refectories.'
Staff
U n l i k e his predecessor,
Northey is determined to try to
create a good impression. He is
very adept at answering awkward
questions. He avoids the issue
extremely well, when he wants to.
On the subject of staff, he is quick
to praise those in the kitchens.
'The kitchen brigade is one of
the finest you will find anywhere,
for the actual work that they have
to cope with, and with the
equipment they actually have. I
am full of admiration for them.
Considering the basic conditions,
many of them do a very good
job.'
He isn't prepared to comment
on the performance of his other
staff, however. When pressed, for
example, about his middle
management, the group of his
staff which has received the
fiercest criticism in recent years,
he will only comment that he has
prepared a document detailing
the changes that need to be made
to the management structure.
Northey does not intend to try
to mislead students. He is
prepared to speak his mind on
certain issues, even if it is likely to
make him unpopular with
students. He believes that the
quality and price of the food is
reasonable, given the constraints
placed on the refectories. He
doesn't believe that there will be
any major price cuts. He doesn't
believe that Southside Shop can
compete with Sainsbury's prices
and must always be regarded as a
corner shop.
He seems determined to make
the changes that he recognises are
needed. He doesn't believe,
though, that the changes will take
place overnight.
'I can't cope'
'We have a lot of schemes, but
most of them take some time to
implement. If we can start a
scheme, plan and implement it in
year or year-and-a-half s time,
we are doing fairly well. With the
sort of money we're spending if
would be very, very siHy to rush
into any new scheme without
doing proper research and
similar work. Otherwise the end
result might not be quite what we
would want or desire or the
students would want or desire.'
In what can only be interpreted
as a warning to College
administrators he adds,
'If there isn't a significant
change in a year and a half I will
leave. I will have failed because I
can't cope with the job or because
I haven't received the support
that I need.'
M r Northey is an ambitious
man who sees the job as another
step in his career. K e certainly
doesn't intend to remain in the
job for over thirty years as M r
Mooney did.
'One always looks for a
challenge. I'm afraid I'm not a
Mr Mooney, the incumbent for
31 years. Any job that's worth
doing is worth spending five or
six years on. Obviously it
depends on the job market, what
comes along, and how well
F E L I X and other people look
after me.
