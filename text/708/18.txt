Records
Despite the banality of the
music, and the continuing
rigours of recession, 1984 had
the biggest grossing record
sales in all time, and in relative
terms, the biggest for over five
years. The beginning of 1985
has been even better and the
fat men at the top of the
company conglomerates are
once again showing those
Cheshire Cat grins of the mid
'70's as they mercilessly
cream off the rewards of the
musicians' hard work.
So why do we carry on
buying? Possibly the reasons
relate to the way young
people use music these days -
wherever you go there are
radios on, people wearing
walkmans. Perhaps it's the
still incredibly low album
prices (where else in the world
can you still get an LP for
under £8?) At Cut Price
Records on High Street Ken.
you can buy Top 40 material
still at £3.99. Quite remark-
able. Or perhaps we carry on
buying simply because we
enjoy the music. With charts
ranging from the biting indie
edge of bands like The Cult to
the ingratiating Duran Duran,
there really is something for
everyone. Pity it's all so
boring
Bands
The past year has seen the
demise of the gender benders,
the loss of omnipotence for
Duran Duran. Even Frankie
Goes To Hollywood no longer
have a guaranteed number
one, after people finally got
fed up with buying the twelvth
mix of the fifteenth title of the
same song. Instead we have
Soul one hit wonders (like
Phyllis Nelson), producer
stars (like Paul Hardcastle),
the return of political idealists
(Billy Bragg), and the charity
mega-hits. It'sallthesame. It's
all so nice. It in reality
challenges nothing.
And where in the past there
have always been new ideas
breaking on the pub scene,
now there is only more of the
same. All is retrospective, all
has rounded edges.
Music Radio
Students at IC are in the very
fortunate position of being
able to tune in to around
fifteen music stations on radio
at any one time, from the ever
consistent Radio 2 to the ever
consistent Capital! IC Radio
plays your requests and chats
in a surprisingly informed
student manner (plug, plug),
N-n-n-n-Paul Hardcastle
the pirates offer everything on
t h e m u s i c a l s p e c t r u m
(especially if you like Greek
folk dancing!) and even the
establishment Radio London
has been breaking new
ground with its reggae and
soul s h o w s (despite the
unfortunately irrepressible
Tony Blackburn) and Radio 1
has moved away from its 'Yes
indeedy' reputation with the
Rankin' Miss P, imported from
the now d e f u n c t D r e a d
B r o a d c a s t i n g C o m p a n y .
Capital has its all new (yawn)
Network Chart, and C o m m u n -
ity Radio looms on the
horizon. True local commun-
ity stations would completely
change the face of the radio
dial. Which way, we can only
wait and see. Another thing
about listening to radio: it's
completely free. Stay tuned.
The Future
The story is always the same.
In the mid '50's the charts (as
they were) were full of old
cronies and retrospectively
bland music. Along came
Elvis and rock 'n' roll. In the
early '60's rock had been
tamed when along came The
Beatles and new vistas in Pop
Music opened before us. 1975
we were listening to (and
getting bored by) the same old
s o u n d s again, w h e n the
Pistols and punk broke. Now,
in 1985, knowing the problem
music faces will not give us
any insight into what the next
'Big Thing' will be. We can
only hope, and while we wait,
enjoy the brief trends; as Soul
turns to Funk and then to Jazz
next year, as Reggae finally
receives popular recognition,
and as maybe you becomethe
next 'Rock 'n' Roll Messiah'.
